Is it possible to eat this squid raw? You know nothing. It is called East Sea Dragon's Beard. Only if we eat it raw, we can get the energy of dragon and sun. Dragon beard. What I have seen does not look like this. And squid, must also be onions burnt to make it delicious. Shame on you. Whose turd is it? Mine. We have invited all prominent gentlemen from all over the Eastern Sea Route. In order to find Mr. Right To be the master of this blessing boat and joyful feast. Don't talk bullshit. Send the bride up to me quickly. The bride is getting married. It's really the mermaid. Wonderful. Wonderful. No. I'll go check it out first. This mermaid can't be a fake, right? Yeah. Eh. If we don't check, how can we know if it's true or not? Yeah. Isn't that right? See the Virgin at a glance. Then fall in love with crazy. Will you marry me? Don't pretend to be a lover. Who is not here for the mackerel pearl to get a half a hundred years of life extension? You know nothing. Take the pearl must first get the mermaid's love. It doesn't help if the woman doesn't love you. Talking about love is outdated. Live dissection is the most exciting. Beautiful. Beautiful. Are you guys crazy? Gold is not a problem. Gold is certainly not a problem. The problem is, the mermaid can only worship with one person. Hands off, you. The mermaid got away. Got away. It's all bloody. Great benefactor. Xi Yin. Xi Yin. Thank you. Stop pretending. What kind of drama is this? Zhao Zhong. I haven't seen you for years. You've grown a lot on the knifeY Zhao Zhong. Weren't you eaten by a dragon on Penglai Island? You should also die on Penglai Island. To pay for the Governor's life. Stop it. Dog minion. If you don't listen to me, I'll skin you. How could this Zhao Zhong listen to a mermaid? She is not a mermaid. There are only a handful of concubines in the palace who can drive the East Chamber. Later, they were both made into human swine and sent to the cold palace by a noble concubine. Seeing that you are behaving odd, I think you are exactly what I am talking about, the demon princess Shen Mei, right? The demon princess. Deserves to be the former Jin Yiwei town governor Yan Lie. Lord Yan. Yan is already a clean body. Lord Yan is too modest. You have the pearl inside you. Underwater breathing freely. Swimming like a flying shuttle. More will be able to control the water to perform one or two. In the maritime disaster. You saved countless villagers. Around the East China Sea, you are called Yan Long Wang. The reputation is not small. Your Majesty can't stop thinking about this clean body of mine, so you must have some plans, right? Yan Dragon King. It's windy here. Let's talk inside. Be careful. There must be something sinister inside the house. What? You don't dare? If you are clean, why don't you dare? Hard Guy. How does it compare to the Xiu Chun Knife More alive. Bloodletting is also more profitable. Not enough fighting outside? Not yet. Does Your Majesty want to talk about things or do things? I am afraid that Lord Yan might be wary of the Emperor. Don't be afraid. The Goddess is in my hands. Anyone who knows about it must die. Then Yan is relieved What. This is going to be silenced. How do you know I'm not a mermaid? Even more expensive rouge, also can not cover the fireworks of the earth. Lord Yan has really tasted the freshness of the mermaid. All these years crisscrossing the East China Sea, I'm afraid you are trying to find your former lover, right? If there is no other business, Yan will leave now. Wait. Madam Mei knows where she is. Brother Zhong. Knowing each other for so many years. No need for that, right? Ouch. Hey. Great benefactor great benefactor. Great benefactor. He beat me. He beat me. Who are all these people? Japanese invaders. This gang of Japanese pirates, obbed the horse express ship of Yingtian Prefecture. But people, we didn't kill them. The guts are hollowed out. How did they die? Not human. It's ghost! It's water ghost! What kind of water ghost? Can't kill. Can't kill. Can't kill. First, it goes in through the mouth. First, it goes in through the mouth. Then eat all the meat in your stomach. Not a bit left. Eat all the meat in your stomach. Not a bit left. Finally slowly. Finally slowly. Getting bigger. Getting bigger. Getting bigger. Getting bigger. Thank you. What is it? There are magical beasts in the town of East Sea Abyss. It is made by the ancient mermaid. The name is, Ghost Dragon King. Its fibrous roots are multiplied by thousands. It can devour all the spirits of heaven and earth. This is a drop in the bucket of the Ghost Dragon King. Secret handwritten notes. Remains of Zheng governor. For thousands of years. Ghost Dragon King. Sealed by the peach blossom island line of mermaids. Need to find these sharks. Only then can the scourge be quelled. According to the secret handbook. The Peach Blossom Island is surrounded by storms and thunder. It must be pacified by the mermaid pearl to enter the island. This is the reason for seeking the companionship of Yan Dragon King. Looking for the mermaid, really for the East Sea peace. Find the mermaid, both for the emperor to share his worries, but also to help obsessed people to solve the sorrow of lovesickness. Peach Blossom Island, is the last lineage of the mermaid. Your sweetheart, perhaps, is also here. If the Ghost Dragon King broke the abyss, Peach Blossom Island, must the same fate of the Penglai. Regrets of the past. Yan Dragon King. Don't you want to get it back? I am willing to go with Your Majesty. I hope that you guys will tolerate more. Good-bye. In fact, if I kill Yan Lie, I can get the pearl just as well. A mermaid pearl. How is it enough to keep me young forever? You are just like Gao Dehai, stupid and dumb. The governor died for His Majesty. The Queen is for her own pleasure. How can they be compared to each other? Dare Zhao Zhong. How dare you show such disrespect to Your Majesty. I am out of line. I hope Your Majesty will forgive me. Zhao Zhong. Bereaved dogs. How to deserve to be called loyal. Your name is Zhao Bu Zhong. Unfaithfulness Unfilial. All are sin-wearing. So that you can be my good dog. Unfilial is willing to go to the fire for the Queen to die. Yan Lie. You don't deserve to kill. The more I think about it, the more it doesn't seem right. This maiden said to go to Peach Blossom Island to find the mermaid is really for the people of the East China Sea? Great benefactor. Trust me. I, Afo, have been through it. The more beautiful a woman is, the more haunted she is. Is Shioyin like that? Xi Yin is certainly not. I mean, the more voluptuous and beautiful a woman is, the more evil is in her heart. Afo. You don't think about it. I have my own arrangements. Rather, you. Don't think about leaving me again. We said I would be cattle and horses for the rest of my lives. ã€‚Afo will follow the great benefactor forever. But this time. Can we really meet Miss Xi Yin? We see each other night after night. Great benefactor. Great benefactor. Here. Here it is. I have been sailing for decades, but I have never seen such a huge dragon sucking water. On this trip. We are afraid that we have offended the Dragon King. Even if there is a divine power through the sky, in the end, it is only a dragon sucking water. Since the dragon absorbs water, its own Yan Dragon King to deal with. Mr. Yan. It's up to you. As expected of the Yan Dragon King. Where is Yan Dragon King? Zhao Zhong. Yan is one step ahead. Chase. Land people. You are not allowed to come down and play. I am also a mermaid. She can't grow a tail. Isn't it the same as land people? Bullshit. Xi Yin you just ignore her. Are you guys childish? Great benefactor. She really is Xi Yin. Xi Yin. Xi Yin. Let me go. Xi Yin. Let me go. It's me. I am Yan Lie. Yes, Xi Yin. He is the great benefactor. I am Afo. You land people. How do you know my name? Xi Yin, you do not remember. When we were in Penglai Island, we went together to find that Fountain of Youth. And you let the Great Benefactor be your husband. Husband. What is the husband? Xi Yin. You. Did you lose your memory? How do you know I have memory loss? The matriarch said it was because I had lost the mermaid pearl. How do you know again? Xi Yin. You've got it wrong. I am going to return the mermaid pearl to you. How can you have the mermaid pearl? Who are you fooling? Then how do you not get a tail for me to see. Where's the tail? Eh, Look at it. The mermaid pearl is here. Did you see that? It's glowing. Bulge up a piece of something. It's ugly. Who knows what kind of mess you swallowed. Men and women cannot hand pass by each other. Xi Yin. You remember this phrase. Mermaid. Young lady. Men and women cannot hand pass by each other. What are you looking at? What's wrong with that? Young lady. Men and women cannot hand pass by each other. This is men and women cannot hand pass by each other. Great benefactor. Land people. Stay away from Xi Yin. Get out of the way. Watch out. Save people. Stupid land people. What are you trying to play the hero. My name is Afo. I didn't dodge it. Patriarch. Patriarch. These people somehow broke through the storm circle. Daring mermaid. Why don't you kneel down when you see Your Majesty? I have sworn a heavy vow. I will not marry in this life. No matter how many times you come to propose marriage, it is also in vain. Patriarch. They are not here to propose marriage. You. Me. Although the look is also considered handsome, not even a fraction more than our Yulang. Please go back. I already fell for someone. I won't marry anyone. This mermaid. It is crazy, right? Patriarch. I have said that I am not here to propose marriage. So you just come to cause trouble. Topple the mountains and overturn the seas. Why do you have the mermaid pearl? You really have the shark pearl. It's a long story. Yan also has many concerns to ask the patriarch for advice. Why should I listen to you? And you don't propose marriage to me. If the marriage is proposedï¼Œ will you marry? Of course not. Yan Dragon King. Patriarch. They are here to deliver a letter. Related to the Ghost Dragon King. How do you know about the Ghost Dragon King? The reason for this. You can ask her. Carry it up. Bring it all back. I'll take you overland. The patriarch said that people with hairy chins are bad people. Your face is so clean. You must be a great guy. Patriarch. This is really the whisker root of the Ghost Dragon King It's genuine. But how can the Ghost Dragon King get out of the ban? It can be seen that the Pearl of the Eastern Emperor, the divine power is about to be exhausted. What is the East Emperor Pearl? I heard that it is the mermaid's holy relic. The ancestor Cang Yue used the power of the Eastern Emperor Pearl to suppress the Ghost Dragon King in the Dragon Palace ruins. Xi Yin. The secret of my clan, not enough for outsiders to know. Yes. Every hundred years, the divine power of the Eastern Pearl will plummet. Patriarch. At that time, it needs to be taken out from the Dragon Palace. Sacrifice it with the power of the whole clan to restore its spiritual power. Then choose a holy woman from the clan. Sent back to the Dragon Palace to guard. However, it's only been ten years since the last generation of Saintess Linglong, who guarded the Dragon Palace. Two Xi. The secret of our clan, the seal has begun to break. We must go down to the Dragon Palace to get the pearl as soon as possible East Factory. All are one in a hundred elite. It can help you. Patriarch. Land people are not to be trusted. Ghost Dragon King is a vicious and violent scourge of the East China Sea. The Ming Dynasty always make common cause with all of you. What you say and it makes sense. Get out. You. In that case. We will go back to the ship first. If there is a dispatch. Always available. Leave Peach Blossom Island as soon as possible. To avoid the birth of right and wrong. Patriarch. Your name is Yan Lie. Is that the land person Xi Yin saved earlier? Exactly. May I ask the patriarch How can I return the pearl to Xi Yin? You really are here to propose marriage. I said it wasn't. What? You don't want to marry Xi Yin? Oh, you heartless thief. Ah. You. You mean Xi Yin. Do you want to marry Xi Yin? I do. Is that okay? No, you can't. Then you say again. Hold on. Why can't I marry? Because the word 'love' is the curse of my clan. Since our ancestor Cang Yue. Any mermaid who falls in love with a landlubber will not end up well. What's more, none of you land people are good. Well, there are always exceptions to everything. Then our Yulang is different. Then why didn't he marry you? See you off. Go back. Xi Yin. Wait for me at the arrow tonight. You're so upset, do you want to go out by yourself? You asked me to go out alone. You asked me to go out alone in the middle of the night. Then I'll go out by myself. I'd better go out by myself. It's so dangerous. I'll go out. I'll go out. Wow. What a big peach blossom tree. What are you muttering about? By the way, I have something for you. Give it to me now. It's not married yet. Never mind. Follow the customs. You murdered your husband, didn't you? Oops what are you talking about. This is the deep sea leech. This kind of deep-sea leech is most useful for treating wounds. Come on. Put your ass up. No, don't. My butt is already healed. Really. Look. I really am. I'll teach you. Here. Look. Look. Close that eye this eye Wow, what a big moon! This is the evil art of you humans Yes, through it you can see far, far away So I can see the world of your people? It's too far. I can take you out if you want to see the outside world no way The matriarch said it's a dangerous world out there What does she know? You have to go out and see for yourself to know if it's dangerous. Besides, I was just a cook in the town before. It was an official boat. Where's Xiyin Xiyin Eh, how come you're the only one, where's the little fat one? He went out for a walk Go to sleep Have a seat What is this You asked the same thing at that time Oops Wait a minute Weird. Not bad When did you become such a good drinker What is this It's soft and so comfortable Tell us what happened in the past In that year , Gao Dehai, the head of the Eastern Factory , was ordered to find a spring that could prolong life . I went along with him as a Jinyi guard. I was saved by you when I first arrived at Penglai. Then Yan Lie saved Xiiyin, then Xhiyin saved Yan Lie then Yan Lie saved Xhiyin again But he was seriously injured by Gao Dehai and then Xiyin gave him the mermaid pearl again to save Yan Lie So complicated no It's about two people rescuing each other and getting attached oh I get it So relationships are all about saving and rescuing Eh, do you save me more often or do I save you more often? You Because you saved my life again today No, you saved me today I've asked the matriarch. To return the mermaid beads , they need to be passed on by word of mouth and both parties need to be driven by love. But love is a mermaid's curse don't you think it's strange? That's how love is in this world Mr. Yan I'm sleeping Oh It hurts to drink alone, so why not let me drink with you? What can I do for you I just came to see you. Say what you want to say, say it. I want you to accompany the mermaids to the Dragon Palace to protect them and retrieve the Pearl of the East I'll do it even if you don't say so Is that all? Is that all? Do you want anything else no Please return you are so ungrateful It's not the first time we've slept in the same bed Please don't talk nonsense You're still afraid of me after all Xiyin Listen to my explanation. The Patriarch is right no human is good This trip to the ruins of the Dragon Palace is why all those travelling with us are candidates for the Holy Maiden Xiyin cannot hide from the water without mermaid beads, so she needs to stay close to Erhi If so why take her with us To avoid that human named Yan coming back to haunt her go This is the remains of the Dragon Palace Keep your voice down The Ghost Dragon King is sleeping in this Dragon Palace Once it's awakened, we'll be dead, you hear me? Linglong it has become dull it has become dull Otherwise, with its divine power it would be impossible for anyone other than the Holy Virgin to come within ten miles of the Dragon Palace. It cannot be taken down and only the chosen Holy Maiden can take the Pearl of the Eastern Emperor. So how do you get selected. Take the Pearl of the Eastern Emperor. Come on, everyone try it. No one knows what the conditions for becoming a holy woman are everything is arranged by the Pearl of the East Back then Linglong and I were both the best in the clan But I was in love with Yulang, I regret that I was not chosen. Now that this has happened, I, as the head of the clan, should step up and take responsibility for regaining the Pearl of the East. I, As the head of the clan, should step up and take responsibility for regaining the Pearl of the East Patriarch, Xiyin has been taken down Patriarch, Give it back to you Take it. Xiyin How do you feel now I feel very nervous What about the bead It's warm The Will of God The Will of God Cut out the mermaid beads before it dies come on thank you Brother Not even daring to kill what fills the stomach, Lord Cho is truly a loser. One for each of you Thank you for your kindness complete I am complete I am complete It's ugly, shave it off You have received the mermaid pearls and should leave the island soon Back to the ship Ghost Dragon King Protect the Pearl of the East The Water Harnessing Technique is simply ineffective against it Patriarch. The Ghost Dragon King has sealed off the way out of the Dragon Palace What should we do? Xiyin Are you okay? Fatty, what are you doing here I'm here to save you, and my name is A Fu A Fu Mixed Thunder Too many bearded roots to finish rootless and endless no end to life Quickly enter the water, the Ghost Dragon King will soon break the ban and come. It is imperative that we make it to the full moon tonightto offer sacrifices to cultivate the Pearl of the Eastern Emperor. Patriarch Xiyin Can rituals and cultivation succeed without mermaid beads? Xiyin Don't worry, we're here, it's no problem. You thanks but I already have someone I like. Won't marry anyone I still won't marry you It's almost nightfall, so get ready Xiyin You have become a Virgin Yan Lie Come with me. Xiyin Xiyin I'm not dreaming, am I! Are you doing this just for the mermaid beads? The matriarch said that the mermaid pearls could be retrieved if we kissed each other in love But why not? Don't you love me? So it was me Xiyin You don't have to force it Yan Lie Tell me what it will take to make me love you. I'm tired of not being a mermaid, I'm tired of being powerless , I want my mermaid pearls back, I want to really protect the people around me. Sorry Madam Why did you forget to knock when came in? This is the human skin art of Gao Li This is the only one of the 3,000 little girls that caught my eye. Do you see how beautiful I am? Do you know what the hardest thing for women is? I don't know I'm so silly how could you possibly know, I didn't know anything when I was your age either. The hardest thing for women is to stay young forever Let your youth stay in this moment Have you seen Jiao Xin She's probably gone to play again. Welcoming the Virgin Beware! Xiyin Madam Sure enough, the Pearl of the East is in perfect condition How do you defuse the water prison technique Because of the mermaid beads, naturally! You killed Jiao Xin The mermaid pearl can prolong life but not as much as this pearl Keeps people young forever This is a holy relic of the mermaid Humans who use it without permission will be killed. Of course I know that but I'm not human. Right He Qing How did you know my name? You went down to the Dragon Palace with me to get the pearls, have you forgotten so soon? You are Ling Long You are indeed not dead, no wonder your corpse was not seen in the Dragon Palace. Ten years ago I didn't go to the Dragon Palace at all, but I became fascinated with the human emperor on the way, when he came to the East Sea for a tour and was still just a prince. Great So you forget who you are in your greed and vanity Bullshit. Even if he were a worthless beggar I would never leave him one-sided statement Otherwise, how could I have suffered the pain of withering to give him the mermaid pearl, and you gave the mermaid pearl to a human. Why do you do it, silly girl We were able to remove the mermaid pearls willingly Naturally, we are deeply in love deep in love Xiyin Don't listen to her Who can charm people better than you? What does it cost to be a mermaid saint? Did you ever tell this girl The matriarch said that the rituals would be physically exhausting. Did she ever tell you that a maiden who becomes a mermaid will be trapped alone in the deep sea and suffer a century of solitude Patriarch Is it true? I I am also doing it for the mermaid clan and for the entire East Sea When you were disqualified by love, you made me the keeper of the palace, why should someone else suffer when you don't want to go there? You have tasted love and yet you want me to die alone. Not so Ling Long If you swallow the Pearl of the east the Ghost Dragon King will break the seal and emerge and the whole East Sea will be devastated! If I can have the beauty of the world, what is the East Sea worth? This beautiful skin will be mine forever You're right. The beauty of the world should belong to me, Shen Mei. Kill go The Pearl of the Eastern King We will get the Pearl of the Eastern King back! No We can't get it back Xiyin I know what you're going through I'd do the same thing if I were you no I'm not talking about the saints I know my memory was erased by you You didn't lose your memory because of the mermaid beads Linglong also lost the mermaid pearl at that time but she didn't lose her memory You suffer from the pain of longing. I Yulang Yulang Are you here to see me off? Patriarch He is not your Yulang Do you remember this place? We parted here and you said that when the peach blossoms were in full bloom you would return to marry me What took you so long, Yulang? I have so much to say to you. Patriarch She is not your Yulang He Qing I'm back I've been looking for you really I go to sea every day I ask around the sea to see if there is a fairy-like mermaid Over the years, I have asked everyone in the East China Sea, I have set foot on every ship that has come and gone. I can't hear from you, I'm really suffering, I miss you so much Don't cry, you found me, didn't you Yes, I found you, but you've changed Have I changed and become ugly? No You've become more beautiful You're fooling around again. Yulang see it Yan Lie I was touched by what you said, but it's just what you call a deep love. Actually, I'd say you don't have to feel bad. It was selfish of me to force you to love me now as you did before , given your memory loss. It was enough for me in my previous life. It's okay. They are shelling Peach Blossom Island bullying people too much. I can't stand it anymore, it's time to give them some credit. Xiyin Patriarch but Everything was arranged for the best A battle to the death to return peace to the East China Sea Fire Madam Fry them to a pulp. Aim at the incoming enemy how did you hit that way Who cares, now charge! Kill the slave Kill the slave Help Lord Zhao Come on, let's go into the cabin thanks you are welcome No way she's going to summon the Ghost Dragon King. Go Stop! Linglong who of you stand in my way, die I'll use my magic wand to retrieve the Pearl of the East, you go and distract Xugen ok Xiyin Why is the Ghost Dragon King not at my disposal? No No Zhao Zhong don't help these lowly fish and beasts by letting go of your glory and wealth You are the real beast in my eyes no No Yan Lie is so warm to cuddle. Yan Lie is so warm to cuddle. The more I hug, the warmer I get Yan Lie swallowed my mermaid pearl to be my husband for life I'm afraid I won't be able to be your husband I remembered I remembered it all The mermaid pearls have been returned to you How can you drive the Ghost Dragon King? Because I have the new Pearl of the East So in the end I still look like this. Why do you still cling to it now? Is beauty so important? How much strife there is in this palace. I Have gone through the pains of the world just to make this face worthy of being loved Have you ever thought of the danger you would put everyone in if you wanted to go against the grain for your own selfish reasons? If I could have his love alone, there would be no more beings in my eyes Come with me or I'll stay I'm coming with you Xiyin What's going on Yan Lie I'm sorry no No Don't take them away stop I am a holy woman, I should suffer a hundred years of solitude alone You can't wait no I can wait, I can wait, I'm willing to wait stop Why does falling in love seem so painful? An inch of love is an inch of ashes, Yan Lang, I know what it's like, why do you have to suffer yourself? Xiyin no Xiyin I I don't want to forget you, I I I don't want to leave you I don't want to forget you, You've finally woken up, my great benefactor. You've had too much to drink at last night's banquet. Are you really not going to erase your memory and stay alone for a hundred years? Do you know how painful it is? It's the pain that makes you feel loved. I need to remember that I love him
