- Where's Gen. Jackson? - He's in the parlor, sir. Having a meeting. - Well, Ms. Minni... - I got to see him. Luther. Luther Kilgore, try to remember what little manners you have. I got bad news, Ms. Minni. Sam Houston's made a speech against annexation. The Austin Blade carries a full statement. This means... I've known since early morning. - What does the General say? - The General doesn't know. - You kept this from him? - That's right. Why? Who are you to decide... I'm not only related to Andrew Jackson. I'm also his friend. I don't want to see him go to his grave any sooner than the good Lord intended. Your Texas has given him enough trouble already. He'll be told when this meeting is over and not before. But I must warn you, sir. If we continue to campaign for Polk on a platform favoring Texas, we'll lose this election. He's right. Texas is a slave state. The people of the North'll never tolerate adding shame to us. I resent that, sir. It's you who've twisted the peaceful relationship between master and slave into an evil. - 'And so, it is.' - 'That's a lie.' 'Highly eternal.' I haven't heard so much dribble since I left Washington. Andy, I paid $17 for that vase. Never did like that vase anyway. Oh, I know that someday or other we'll have to settle the question of slavery. But right now, our people are on fire with a new vision. When they think of Texas, they think of California and the Oregon territory. A democratic nation, rich and magnificent 'stretching from sea to sea.' Yes, sir. That's our destiny. And when the people go to the polls, they'll tell us so too. And then with the help of God, my old friend Sam Houston... 'Not anymore, General.' Read this, sir. - The meeting isn't over. - I had to do it, Ms. Minni. "For his sudden reversal Houston said "three times we've petitioned to be taken into the union "and three times we've been refused. "Now, let's have no further talk of union "but of building a greater Texas." Ah, this is what comes of your bickering. 'Your confounded procrastination.' Minni, did you know about this? Yes, but I saw no reason to disturb you until something constructive could be done. Constructive? Devereaux Burke is due here at 6 o'clock. Dev in Tennessee? What's he doing here? - 'Business.' - I don't approve of Mr. Burke. 'Nor he of you.' But there's a job to be done. A big job. Someone will have to find Sam Houston. He's gone off into the Comanche country. Who'll go after him? You, Colby? Thompson? Mr. Mayhew? And who'll be willing to campaign for us down there with more than half the people fighting mad against us. It's 6 o'clock. Where is he? Is he going to disappoint us? Could a man be more prompt? - 'Good evening, Mr. Burke.' - 'Hello. Is General in?' 'Yes, sir.' - Am I late, Minni? - No. But if I were younger, you'd have been here an hour early. Good evening, General. You're looking extremely well. That's a lie, but I'm happy to hear it. You know these gentlemen, don't you? - Oh, sure. Colby. - Mr. Burke. - Thomas. - How do you do, sir? Well, Mr. Mayhew, as I live and breathe. And how's the foreclosure on Widows and Orphans' bidders? - I don't think... - No need to answer. By the cut of your clothes and swell in your belly, I can see. - Thompson. - 'Howdy, Dev?' Luther! How did you get so far north? - Sure good to see you. - I've been looking for you. Tonight Nashville Hotel, 9 o'clock. Uh, Minni tells me you volunteered to help us bring Texas into the union. Well sir, Minni made me a kind of proposition. 'Proposition?' It-it was only politics, Andy. I promised him, but I said, you'd have to approve of it. You'll excuse us, gentlemen. You'll hear from me soon. - 'Goodnight, General.' - Goodnight. Goodnight. Minni...come here. Now say, what's all this about? Well, General. Annexation means war with Mexico. You're going to have to send troops to defend Texas. Those troops will have to be fed. - I want to feed 'em on my beef. - I don't believe it. You, a Texan, trying to make a deal when your country's life hangs in the balance. You, a man who'll fall against the legions of Santa Ana. - Or did you fight? - I fought. When it was over, was left with a gun, rope and a horse to ride. And all of Texas to find a living. - Does a man need more? - I didn't ask for more. But I've learned a few things this end, General. If I'm gonna risk my neck, I wanna come out this time with something more than glory. 'You are a scoundrel. At least, a knowledged one.' We'll buy your beef. Come closer. I wanna speak to you frankly. Not because I have any hope of rekindling the spark of patriotism in you. But because I'm frightened for the first time in my life. I'm frightened for the future of the United States. You see, sir. We're on our way to becoming a great nation. The powers of Europe know this. And they'd stop at nothing to block us. Why, even now they're trying to use Texas against us and there are men down there conspiring with them to destroy us. Well, that's hard to believe, sir. There's bitterness towards the States but they're still Americans. Yeah, and they're proud and headstrong too like Sam Houston. But they're being led into a trap. Now, that's the reason you gotta find Sam Houston wherever he is, without him, we are lost. I'll give you a letter to him. Minni. Now.. you tell him it's my wish. Probably, my last wish. That the dream we both shared that we worked so hard at.. be fulfilled. Now, you tell him that. What plans have you made so far, Dev? I'll set up in Austin. That's where the real opposition is. Headed by a man named Tom Craden. Tom Craden, cattleman? Gold, cattle, cotton. Anything you might name. Why is he against us? What's his stake in this? I don't know exactly, sir. He got in early. Dug down deep. Likes things the way they are, aims to keep 'em that way. - Real noisy about it too. - You'll have to shut him up. - He's got an awful loud voice. - Oh, he'll shut him up alright. I'll be in Austin in 30 days. Will you be there? Why, Minni. Did you ever know me not to get some place where a beautiful woman is waiting for me? Oh, damn! - Well Luther, this is it. - Yup. Sure you got everything straight? It's important. Nacogdoches's your ranch. Sid Yoakum Bud Avery. New Orleans, Louis Mizette. San Antonio, Henry Gurau. You got it. - So long. - See you in Austin. 'Hey, Burke. You Burke! Hold up a minute.' - Well, Mr. Mayhew. - Thought I'd lost you. You've been doing some hard riding. - I got a long way to go. - Maybe I can save you the trip. - Oh? - Shall we step down? What's in your mind? Whatever your deal's with Jackson, I've a better one. - You? - I'm a friend of Tom Craden's. I thought you were a friend of Andy Jackson's. A man can have more than one friend. Hold it. You oughta know I never make more than one deal at a time. Tell it to Tom Craden. Now ride, north. Well, looks like warm weather ahead, Dev. I'll worry about Tom Craden when I get to Austin. Right now, I'm headed for Sam Houston in Comanche country. - And Indians scare me. - Well, good luck. I'll need it. - You got any more rounds? - These might be enough. Nice shooting, mister. You're not doing so bad yourself. My name's Tom Craden. - Craden? - Yeah, and you're real welcome. I figured, I might be. Right after the tough talk then they'll be back for a shootout. What's a man with good sense doin' in Comanche country? I was just gonna ask you the same thing. I'm looking for a fellow named Burke. You know him? Really well, why? He's riding south tryin' to stir up annexation trouble. - And you aim to stop him? - If I can find him. - Where'd you say you hail from? - I didn't say. I was heading for Austin. I know the short way in. Lucky you met me. Not too lucky. Here they come. This is the big group. - Nice knowing you. - Yeah, real nice. Hey! Hey, look here, son. Ain't the street wide enough for you? Why don't you save your breath, Windy. Ain't you heard the news? Jim Folkes' been elected President of the United States. - We're going into the union. - Now you look here, brother. That's the kind of talk that's dangerous. - That's right, Windy. Tell 'em. - Tell 'em all about us! Well, come on over here, neighbors. I've got a few more words to say to you. 'Come on, Windy. Give us some more historical facts.' - Houston's coming along. - Yeah. Say, you done well up on the Sabine, huh? You might call it well. How many head the last count? We don't count our cattle up there. We could use you down here. We got big plans for Texas. - What if she goes to the union? - She won't. Sam Houston's against it. So is our president, Anson Jones. We don't need Yankee dressmakers to tell us what to do. - How do people feel about it? - The people? What do they know? Why don't you have supper with me tonight? We'll talk about it. I might just do that. Why, to join the union would be death. The citizens of our Lone Star Republic will be left to their certain fate in the war that'll follow. Just as sure as day follows night. - War with who? - War with Mexico. - Who said so? - I said so. - Ain't I right brother? - That's Windy. One of our men. Makes a good speech when he's sober. They've already warned us. Why, they'll send an army down on us like a.. a-a Duck on a Junebug. - And I don't blame... - Wait a minute.. - Well now, don't you shout... - Alright, get down! 'I'm Luther Kilgore, a Texan.' And no man frightens me with a loud talk. If we have to go to war to join up on our own folks I say the sooner the better. We're raring to go! You're a liar. We've had enough fighting and killing. There isn't a family that didn't lose kin at the Alamo. And we don't want it to happen again. With Mexico waiting to be our friend, we can live in peace. M'am if you was a man and wore a gun you wouldn't call me a liar. I'm a man. I wear a gun, and I call you a liar. Ooh...you can shoot better than that. Why kill a man for a mistake in belief? Tom, told you many times I don't need you to fight my battles. - Honey, it's my battle too. - But you were wrong. I could've handled him without any gun pulling from anybody. And you too, you were just as wrong. I'm sorry. Next time, I'll let him settle his own fight. And what makes you think he can't? It was a favor. My horse spooked. Oh, you're two of a kind! Windy, go on with your speech. Yes ma'am, and I sure got plenty more to tell 'em. Come on, neighbors, follow me. Come on. - I'd call her a lot of woman. - She's all of that! Come on, I'll have you meet her. - She runs the Austin Blade. - A newspaper woman? Yeah, her father left it to her. He was a Texan. So is she. She's been a lot of help to us. Excuse me, ma'am. I figured you was out and needed help. Maybe, I did. Anyhow, I'm glad you're back. - Lot of strangers here now. - 'Probably, Burke's men.' You've been tangling with a Cougar? No, Comanches. I want you to meet the man who saved my hair. - Oh, it's good to know you Mr.. - Bill Jones of Nacogdoches. I'm Martha Ronda and thanks for saving Tom's hair. He looks scandalous without it. As a matter of fact, you don't look too good with it right now. - Could get a stitch or two. - Cynthia will fix it. It'll be sewed up like a new shirt in no time. Oh, Mr. Jones is having supper with us. Tonight? Have you forgotten about the Senators? - No. That's why I want him. - Oh, hello Tom. - Oh hello, Josh. - Seen our new type? Just got in from Philadelphia. - I like it better than the old. - Me too. C'mon, take a look. Tom seems to have a lot to say in these parts. Does the Austin Blade speak for him too? I speak for myself, Mr. Jones. Oh. You better have a doctor look at this. Is that an order? I don't wanna make any more mistakes. - You're making one right now. - Sorry. Send copies of last week's stuff out to the house. You're busy. What about tomorrow or Sunday? I'll expect you at 7. Don't disappoint us. - I'm won't. Goodbye. - Bye. Bill Jones of Nacogdoches, huh? He's a good man. We can use him. What makes you so sure, he's on our side? Well, I just took it for granted. You take great many things for granted, Tom. - Someday you may be sorry. - I doubt it. I really doubt it. Alright, just a minute, and I tell you that anybody that talks annexation is a traitor! You'll find a snivelling Yankee behind all this union talk. Comes to betray it for just a few peaches of silver. Why don't you hush up, big blabber mouth? Hah, just folks, we just ain't gonna pay no attention to her. 'Probably another Yankee sympathizer.' But like I was saying folks if we're going to keep our independence we can't get mixed up with a lot of Northern politics. Shut up! Ladies and.. - Serves him right. - What's that? - Minni. - Oh, hello, son. - What are you up to? - None of your business. - Where's Sam Houston? - Nobody seems to know. - What happened to you? - Indians after Craden's scalp. - And you stopped 'em? - I helped a little. - Damn, you're a fool. - Yes, so I've been told. - What happened to your pitcher? - I wanna hear about Houston. The door's wide open for Texas to come in. Without Sam, we haven't got a prayer. Now, where is he? I looked in Comanche country, couldn't find him. He's probably off living with some other tribe. If I didn't know Sam's folks, I'd say he was half Indian. He can talk with them, eat with them, sleep with them. Will you stop looking for that fool pitcher? I flung it out, you know it. - Minnie, you're a bad girl. - Never mind about me. That man Craden's been ridin' after you. - Did you know that? - Told me so himself. He'll tell me lot more tonight at supper, I hope. Are you insane? You'll get yourself killed. Oh, no. He might kill that Burke but he's real friendly towards Bill Jones. All this fuss over a flea bitten rough sprung Republic that can't... Careful Minni, I'm a Texan. And this flea bitten Republic of ours is bigger than dozen of your United States all put together. It also grows some beautiful women. You get your job done before you start lollygagging. I just like to live a baron's life. Some of this, some of that. Any of my men get here? Some half dozen of 'em. They're all at the bar. I never saw such a conglomerate. What are you staring at? - You been talking to her? - Mm-hmm. If she finds out who you are, she'll kill you. If she doesn't, her man will. - Her man? - Tom Craden. Oh. Well, she's still a lot of woman. You know how when you rub your hand over silk, you get a shock and you see little sparks? Well, I figure that's what would happen if you stroked her. - Hello, George. - How are you, Dev? Feeling better this side. - How's Luther? - Up in bed. I bet. Hello Sid. Well, how's your world, all the women in it? The world is wonderful, but the women are most difficult. Most particularly, the one from New Orleans he inherit from you. - Oh. - Madame Fifi? - Oui, most expensive. - I warned you. I know. But I'm weak, and she's beautiful. Oh, very beautiful. Uh, this venture, profitable perhaps? Where can we talk? Hello, Luther. What'd they do to you? You creased me in the shoulder. That's what you did. I'm sorry. You're lucky. Craden would've put it right here. Hmm. Fine company you're keepin'. What were you doin' ridin' into town with him? I'll tell you later. From now on, no more speeches, hear me? - Who's this? - 'My boy, Bud.' Claims he's in this with us. - How old are you, Bud? - 17. Well, I'm going on 17. Come 16 week before last. He wanted in Dev. Shucks, we wasn't older than him when we was fighting Chiricahuas up along the Llano. - The Chiricahuas were easy. - What's this all about? Well boys, we're gonna put Texas into the union. - Why? - Because annexation means war. - And war means... - I'm not interested in war. Unless, it's for others. - $5000 is a lot of money. - $5000 a piece? - $5000. There shall be war. - Yes. - Interested, Gurau? - Oh, in money always. - What must I do? - You'll get your assignment. Sid, you and Luther'll work with me out of Austin. For 5000, save your money. We'll work for annexation for free. - We believe in it. - Yeah. So does, Luther. He found out it hurts. - I don't want your money, Dev. - Then, bow out. I don't want anybody riding the glory road, they're dangerous. You're right. I learned that about you at Santa Ana when you were ridin' the glory road. - Fighting for money there... - That was 10 years ago. Now, do as I tell you. Nobody leaves the hotel tonight. We'll work out details tomorrow. Details, they are unimportant. $5000 is most important. - Oh. Hey, my clothes get here? - Yup, upstairs. Show him, Bud I got an engagement tonight, business. - C'mon, Sid. - Au revoir. May she be as beautiful as Fi-fi? Oh, but not so expensive. - Welcome, from my master. - Gracias, amigo. Senor Craden awaits you in the great hall. Gracias, Senor. Good evening. Ms. Rhonda. Mr. Jones. I hardly recognized you. Shave and a change of clothes makes a big difference. - It does? - Yes, is the name still same? Isn't Jones a good name? Yes, but somehow it doesn't quite fit you. I bow to a woman's intuition. They're waiting for you. 'Almost too much for one man, Tom.' - Excuse me. Hello, Jones. - Craden. Nice to see you. Gentlemen, may I present Mr. Jones of the Sabine. - Hello, Tom. Sorry, I'm late. - It's quite alright. Come in. - Ms. Ronda. - Good evening. - Gentlemen. - Hello. Jones, this is Senator Demmet. - Howdy, sir? - Demmet, sir. He's senior government member. Seldom agrees with me. Certainly not about this business of annexation. - Please, don't use that word. - What's wrong with it? To me, it's just another word for treason. That's a harsh word, Tom. I've been called many things, but never a traitor. No. No one could ever call you that, sir. You favor our joining the State, Senator? - 'I do.' - What do we have to gain? I've heard the argument. Seems to me that... Perhaps, you haven't heard our side of it properly, sir. Look like Texas is caught in the middle... Surely, Mr. Jones is interested more in food than politics. So, with your kind permission, I'll rescue him. Unless of course, you'd rather not be rescued. Please. Guess, Mr. Jones is getting the best part of the deal. - No doubt. - I agree. Nobody should have any trouble choosing Ms. Ronda 'in a bunch of old politicians.' 'Speak for yourself, sir.' First, the man rides into town and shoots the opposition. Then, he takes on their leader. Haven't you heard of discretion, Mr. Jones? Oh, often. But I don't approve of it. - Do you? - Yes, completely. Oh, you mean, political discretion? I mean, any kind. Demmet and the others favor annexation, don't they? - Yes. - Then, why are they here? We hope to change their minds. - Senorita? - Si. That jackass is trying to tell me how to cook the meat. - Si, senorita. - Gracias, senorita. They'll be quiet. You know, there're really the best of friends. Although, they fight most of the time. Well, that's the privilege of friendship. How long do you expect to stay in Austin, Mr. Jones? A week, a month. Haven't given it much thought. - I imagine your family has. - I don't have a wife. - If that's what you're asking. - I wasn't. But now, that you've mentioned it, why don't you have a wife? - No woman ever said, "Yes." - How many have you asked? None. Do we have to rush back? I'm only half rescued. Discretion. I believe in it. Remember? Is that honesty or modesty? Conversation. - Why haven't you? - Why haven't I what? - Asked a woman to marry you? - Oh, that. Perhaps, I was travelling too fast. - Oh. - Today, I started to slow down. That's a beautiful song. Won't you sing it again? ♪ Moonlight was meant for lovers ♪ ♪ Breezes were meant to sigh ♪ ♪ To sigh for unhappy lovers ♪ ♪ Lovers were meant to cry ♪ ♪ Love like a cold December ♪ ♪ Chills when the amber's die ♪ ♪ Be careful my heart remember ♪ ♪ Lovers were meant to cry ♪ I'm afraid, I'm being rude to our guests. And very difficult to one of them. Now, we're both being rude. You know all about me, and I know nothing about you. Are you sure, I know all about you...Mr. Jones? What's this tone? Gentlemen, what I've to say is in strictest confidence. I hope, that you'll be as convinced as I am. If Texas is to realize destiny, there's only one way to it. First, you should know that in return for a guarantee that there will be no annexation. Mexico has promised everything North of the Rio Grande and all the lands of California. - Wha-what's this? - When did this happen? Secondly, we know, the question of slavery will split the union. 'And gentlemen, the Southern states' 'will not only comply, but be happy to join.' - That's a broad statement. - How can you be sure? When that time comes.. this will represent your Republic of Texas and this.. this will be all that's left of your so called United States. This is fantastic. Are the British and French aware of this? They are. We'll make treaties to that effect. For what do the British speak for the people of Texas? Captain Elliott's gonna act as emissary with President Jones's approval. - I've heard of it. - I don't like it. - Neither do I. - I've no part of it. The foreigners want us out of the union to prevent growth. And to keep Texas under their influence. - Their motives don't worry me. - Well, I am worried. So am I. And I'll fight that treaty on the senate floor. And when I've beaten it, I'll vote for annexation. Gentlemen, gentlemen, can't you see what this means? We'll be the giant of the Western hemisphere. As State, we'll be one of 28. As Republic, we'll have respect of not only the United States, but the entire world. Why should we give up an empire just for Statehood? What is your opinion, Mr. Jones? Well, I, uh, I know very little of politics, uh.. but, uh.. we, uh, Texans have a toast, which is 10 years old. To Sam Houston, the father of our Republic. May his road always be ours. - Won't you join us, gentleman? - I'm afraid not. If Sam moves against annexation, he goes without me. If he does? He last spoke against it, senator. Sam was angry when he spoke. Or perhaps, had another reason. If there's doubt, shouldn't we find Houston to verify that? Yes. We should send for him. He should've 10 treaties worked out with all the Apaches by now. The Mescalero Apaches? 'That's not public knowledge' 'and it won't till he gets back to Austin.' Personally, I think, he just wanted to keep out of discussions like this, and so do I. I've enjoyed your meal, Tom, but I can't go along. Will you ask Mizette to bring up my horse? That won't be necessary. Knowing your sentiments, I invited you here, tonight in the hope I could persuade you to reason. I failed. The senate will be called to session to ratify the treaty. You gentlemen, will remain as my guest until the question is being voted upon. - Tom, I want us to win, but... - There's no other way. So, if I want to leave, you'll keep me here by force? - My men will. - I want personal satisfaction. - Count me in on that. - Why, certainly. At your convenience, gentlemen. Which is immediately. You have pistols, I presume. I have. I'll join you in the portico. - This is crazy. What if... - Don't worry. - Will you serve as my second? - If you wish. Frankly, I won't enjoy it. Each of those men, is 60 or better. Each has killed his man the past year. Serving in our Texas senate keeps their hands in. But I'm glad, you're not a senator. - The usual rule, sir? - I don't care. As long as I get a shot at him. - You may not, being last. - Well, I may be lucky. The man's a scoundrel, but he's an excellent shot. So I learn. Gentlemen. Gentlemen, you will pace of 10 steps. At the word, you will fire. Is that understood? Take your places. Ready? One. Two. Three. Four. 'Five. Six.' Seven. Eight. Nine. Fire! A million in one, and he made it. It's a habit of his. Why didn't you fire at me? I certainly tried to kill you. And came close enough. Ah! I've never heard of such ungentlemanly conduct. - Give me my coat. - 'Senator Crockett.' You're next, unless Senator Demmet wants another shot. Why all these heroics, Tom? - You'll hold your fire with me? - Why not? There's no reason to kill a man for a mistaken belief. 'I'm darn better than Demmet.' But I'll be hanged if I'll shoot at a man who won't shoot back. - Nor will I. - Then, remain here as my guest. - If so, I'll send my men. - 'I will not.' Three more drinks and I'll fight my way out. - So will I. - We all will. You're a fool, Tom. A fool with courage. - But let's have some whisky. - Good idea. - An excellent idea. - Some of my best whisky. After you, gentlemen. Here you are. I don't plan to fight my way out of here. Thank you. Tom. We'd better do something about this. You better let me cool them off first. Whatever you hear for the next few minutes won't count. Would you both excuse me? One last glass of wine and dinner and Demmet would've killed your man. My man? Isn't he? Why, I never thought of it quite that way. He has. Yes, I suppose, he has. Since I've been running the paper, we been together a lot. Fighting for the same things. He takes it for granted, that someday, we'll marry and... Takes you for granted? - Does that surprise you? - No. I suppose, he knows what he's doing. I envy him. Why? It's convenient to have a woman you can take for granted. Not very exciting, but convenient. I've never been that lucky. But you want that sort of woman? Frankly, no. And I'll tell you something else. I don't think you are that sort of woman. Are you? Are you? Am I? Come here. Now, tell me, who are you? A man who loves you. You lied when you gave me your name. I'm not lying now. If you don't mind, I'll be leaving. It's just that I rather not drink Tom Craden's wine tonight. The next time, I see him, I'll tell him why. I'll tell him. I wouldn't, if I were you. I doubt, if he'd understand. Then, Craden asked the senators to promise they wouldn't leave. They all went inside except, Ms. Ronda and myself and, uh.. Well, that just about covers it. You left out one detail. You didn't tell me you were in love. Why do you say that? Had a milk cow once. Each time she went dry, she looked like you do, now. That was love. Well, I suppose, I am. She know who we are? What you're here for? - No. - Son, you're in a mess. We need those senators, or did she change your mind about that deal you made with that Andy Jackson? - Not in so many words. - What kinda answer is that? Well, put it this way. I have a wandering foot. This is the first time, I ever wanted a woman. - What? - Hear me out. This is the first time I ever wanted a woman to be my wife. And you're going to have her? In spite of your word and your belief... I have no belief. With Annexation of Texas. Anyway, the cat jumps. I'll take care of me. Been fighting for money for a decade. To me this is just another deal. - She isn't just another woman. - She certainly isn't. One kiss or maybe it was two, and you're ready to turn your coat to whichever side pleases her the most. Do you think your kisses meant the same to her? - It might be. - 'Don't be a fool, Dev.' Her men folks died for Texas. The woman's a patriot. She doesn't fight for money. Tell her what you're doing and she'll never look at you again. We'll see about that. - Where you going? - To get your senators. And keep Minniver, until I find Sam Houston. Mind you. Don't get hurt. Pay off and find your hats. - We're moving. - Me, with Kings back to back? Save your money. Mizette's got aces. - How'd you know? - You had 'em in New Orleans. Figured you brought them with you. Seth, you bring your rope? Yeah, if I'm gonna hang, I wanna be comfortable. You'll be comfortable. - Where are you going? - With you. - Oh, no. - Oh, this arm don't bother me. Me and old Sam fought a hundred Comanches once with no arms. Fought 'em with our bare teeth. What teeth? Tie him off. I can handle it from here. - Won't you need an extra gun? - No. Not for you, fat one. Don't press me. The fate of our Nation must not be banded over empty glasses. - Let me fill yours, Senator. - 'That won't be necessary.' I'm sure, you gentlemen, would rather make your decisions in the Hall of Congress. Martha told me you'd gone. She didn't say you'd be back. - I'm not here as a guest. - So, I see. I seldom carry a gun at home. However, if I offended you.. Vicente and your men are tied at the gates. I've come to send your guests home. You're free to leave, gentlemen. - I don't quite understand. - 'Let's put it this way.' Like you, I'm for annexation. - Your horses are in the corral. - Don't know that I want to. If you people go about it this way. No wonder Houston's against annexation. He won't be when I see him. I carry a letter from Andrew Jackson to Houston guaranteeing that the United States will welcome Texas into the union. - Does he promise troops at war? - 'He does.' In that case, I'll go. Frankly, I was fixing a fight out of here in about 10 minutes. - And I'm with you. - Glad this man helped. Come along. 'Just a minute.' You don't look like a liar. - What lies have I told you? - In words, none. You made me believe a lie, and proved me a fool. You're not alone, Tom. Mr. Jones is very adept at proving people fools. You're very clever, Mr. Jones. - 'Very clever.' - The name is Burke. I just about figured that out. What happened, Martha? I kissed her and told her I loved her. Would you say that if Tom had a gun? - 'I would.' - Then, let me get one for him. He'll be faster than me. Can't afford to die, tonight. You'd be smart if you killed me, right now. I'd rather not. I should tie you off. Both of you. I'll take your word that you won't follow me, until morning. You have it. Now, get out! I'm sorry, Tom. You can't explain things like this. - I saw him, something happen... - Don't make excuses. It's done. All we have to worry about is what he'll do next. He'll go to Houston, of course. With Jackson's guarantee from the Union. If I'd follow him, the only way I can stop him is with a bullet. If you follow him? That's for you to decide. It's morning. It's morning, Buster. I forgot, it comes just after midnight. Hold. Hold up. There he is. Use your rifle. He's already crossed. You men, wait here. I'll ride in alone. These Apaches aren't friendly. I don't want them to think this is a war party. I come to speak with Houston. The Raven. Burke. Dev Burke. You've come all the way from Nacogdoches. All the way from Niceville, General. Well, it's good to see you. Well, these are my friends. Chiefs of the Apache Nation. Who've asked me to settle their boundary disputes. 'Burke.' Well, Dev, what brings you here? From Andrew Jackson. I was with him when he wrote it. Well, did he speak of me with kindness? Well, he was bewildered. Your speech against annexation. - Well, Andy believes that? - So does all of Texas. - Your own words made it clear. - My words were for fools. Three times Texas has stood like a bride at the altar. And three times she's been denied. Well, there is a thing called pride. And we Texans have our full measure. I understand that. What about the treaty with Mexico? No, that. That was to build fear in those who barred the gates to us. Those idiots in Washington, who've set their hands against us just because of our slaves. I had to get some action out of them. And I did. It was a trick I learned from Andy himself. I thought he'd understand. You'll speak out again for annexation at the right time? Yes, I will. And this letter assures me that it won't be too long. So, you could put Andy's mind at rest. Tell him the man who fought beside him against the British.. still stands at his side. And tell him Sam Houston has betrayed the people of Texas. 'Tom Craden.' What brings you here beyond the Pecos? I was chasing a renegade, instead, I find two. - I don't like the word. - You're wearing a gun? You fools! This valley is sacred to the councils of peace. If you'd drawn.. even I couldn't have helped you. Well, Tom. So, you've called us renegades? - Have you anything more to say? - What else is there? You let us to believe in the Republic and you're playing a game of politics. 'Sometimes that's necessary.' I've done what I consider best for Texas. For us to stand alone would be to invite destruction. - But as a state in the union... - A state in the union. One voice and the Congress are pot menders? Our laws made by people who hate us? A beggar standing hat in a hand before his master? Is that what bothers you, Tom? That Texas might become less important 'or that you might?' I know you. You want to make a big name for yourself. Become the next president of Texas. 'But you're not going to sacrifice the welfare of others' for your own personal ambition. There are many people who'll agree with this man. President Jones is one of them. Anson Jones will do what I tell him. When word comes from the North that they've voted to accept us I'll talk with Jones. Until then.. these are my friends, who need my help. But what if the Texas senate should meet immediately? The treaty with Mexico may be signed before you return. Not if I tell them to wait. Geronimo, my saddle bag. I have your permission to leave? Well, there's rain in the hills. You may share my quarters if you care to ride out in the morning. I'll ride tonight. I'll give you a letter to President Jones. He will delay any legislation until I get there. - Will you make camp with us? - I think not, sir. Everyone seems to be in a hurry tonight. Very well, I won't be long. Mangus Colorado tells me, if I turn you and Craden loose on the same trail, there might be trouble. And he's right. Geronimo, I want you to take my friend along the high trail to the Pecos. - Good luck, Dev. - Thank you, sir. And/Ends Godspeed. When I become chief, I will own such a gun. Isn't Takashim your father? The son of a wizard becomes a medicine man not a chief. I'll become chief. They said they caught us merry over here. If Burke tries to cross, kill him. What if he crosses at the shallow? I'll be there with Alfredo. Come on. I'll leave you now. Your way is there. Thanks, Geronimo. Tell your father he's bred a warrior that will someday be chief. There. He's down. Keep your eyes open. He's a smart one. 'I think we killed him.' 'He's alive.' 'Shoot him.' 'Shoot, shoot. Go on, shoot.' 'I don't want any favors from you. Shoot.' Come on, boy. Up. Come on, come on. 'One moment, I'm comin'.' I want to see Miss Ronda. She's asleep, senor. Come tomorrow. No, no, tonight. Now. Well, please, senor. She's asleep. 'Who is it?' A gentleman. He says he wants to see you. It's alright. Where's Tom? What have you done to him? You've killed him, haven't you? Haven't you? Isn't that what he meant to do to me? Alright, he's alive. I had a chance to kill him but didn't. You wanna know why I didn't? As long as Tom's alive, I don't care why. Thanks for telling me. That's what I wanted to know. 'Dev, wait.' I do wanna know why. You already know, you just wanna hear me say it, don't you? It was because of you. If I kill him, you'd never forgive me even though you love me. You're so positive, aren't you? So very positive. Yes, I am, about a lot of things now. You and Craden and Texas. You think you're both on the same side fighting for the same thing. But you've got a surprise coming. Craden's riding the glory road. Wants to be the next president of Texas. I don't believe that. Tom wants the same things I do. A free land where people can live in peace and be happy. And if someday he's elected president, I'll be proud of him. And Texas will be lucky because he's a great man. Then you'll be the great man's wife. Maybe, I will. And maybe, that's what you're really interested in. Tell me something. If you ask Craden to give up his fight against annexation for you what would his answer be? No. Of course, it'll be no. Now, here's a letter from Sam Houston I talked to him a few days ago. He's in favor of joining the union. Craden was there and heard him. If I deliver this letter to Anson Jones the way will be cleared to certain annexation. Tear it up if you want. Throw out in the fire. You see, Martha, you do love me. That's why you wouldn't ask me to give up what I'm fighting for Dev... Why pretend the truth isn't the truth? I've known ever since that night in the patio. You'll never kiss another man like that. Some women might. But not you. - Good morning, Josh. - Mornin'. Mornin' Say you, you've been eating bird shit or somethin'? Josh, you know it just came over me. You're a great newspaperman, yet you've never had a scoop. Well, what a scoop? Why there ain't another newspaper within 300 miles. - You've made up the front page? - Oh, you betcha. And I saved two columns for that Mexican treaty story. That's just the point, Josh. There isn't gonna be any treaty. No. And I think Houston's coming out for annexation. Why, that is terrible. I'm not so sure anymore. Say, are-are you sure you're feeling alright? You know, a powerful lot this mornin'. - Oh, I feel fine. - Well, then tell me somethin'. How will I fill the front page without the treaty story? You take any of these Washington dispatches. - What's that? - Ah, here's one. Got a big scandal up there. "They claim that Pope played favorites in awarding a huge Army beef contract to a North Texas cattleman named.." Well, what's the matter? Ain't that big enough for the front page? It's just big enough. Just hold the space. - Good morning, Miss Ronda. - Morning, Ben. - Is the President in? - Yes, ma'am. - I believe, he's expecting you. - Thank you, Ben. Oh, excuse me, Mr. President. Good morning, ma'am. Come in. Come in. You're about to witness a historic moment in our Republic. I know you'll handle it properly in your paper. You know Captain Elliott of the British Embassy. - Captain. - Miss Ronda. Sign the treaty, Mr. Secretary. Pending of course, to the approval of the Congress. You're going to do this in spite of Houston? Houston? Oh, didn't Mr. Burke give you his letter? Letter? What letter? Just a moment, Ashbel. Are you gonna let one man's opinion spell the difference between peace and war? If that man is Houston, yes. A man named Burke, here to see you, sir. Says he has a message from Sam Houston. - 'Show him in.' - Yes, sir. President. Hello, Miss Ronda. You have a message from General Houston? I have. - Where is he? - Beyond the Pecos River. Making a treaty for the Apache nation. You call this a message? Well, it was one when I started. There was trouble at the Pecos. The water must've washed the words away. And what was the message supposed to say? It asked that legislation to be held over until Houston arrives to speak in Congress against the treaty. Against? It was him who proposed this treaty with Mexico. That was for reasons of strategy. Mr. Houston is for annexation and always has been. You say he's with the Apaches? When will he arrive in Austin? Three weeks, a month. But, Mr. President, you can't wait that long. Haven't I impressed upon you the value of time in this matter? I'd wanna know if this man's telling the truth. To sign these paper is one thing. But to call Congress together for it's ratification that defiles a Sam Houston may bring a thousand men, storming into Austin. Not signing it will bring five times that many across the Rio Grande. I'm sure Mr. Burke knows that this means war. - Immediate war with Mexico. - I do. And how will we fight that war? With what troops? - With troops from the States. - And how will we feed them? On beef I suppose. We've plenty of it here in Texas. On your beef? The beef you'll sell to the army? Mr. President, this man is a liar. A cheap adventurer hired by Andrew Jackson who'd profit by the death of Texas. What do you say to this? Does this mean that you won't wait for Houston? It does. I bid you good day, sir. Sign the treaty, Mr. Smith. Issue a call for Congress to meet in a special session for it's immediate ratification. Yes, sir. Is this for publication, Mr. President? - It is. - Thank you, sir. 'My congratulations, Mr. President.' Just a minute. This horse belongs to Craden. Give it back to him. And give him back his woman, too. We can't just sit here and do nothing. We've gotta put up some kind of a fight. Why don't we tell Andy Jackson. This will kill him. Gentlemen. You too, Minni. You've been talking for an hour and none has an answer. You know why? Because there isn't any. Why don't you have one more try at Jones? And be reminded again that I'm a scoundrel. - No, thanks. - Ain't there no way? We ain't short on men who are willing. But we're short on miracles. That's what it'd take to change things now. A smart man knows when he's whipped. 'Dev. Dev.' Martha rounded them. Folks going crazy out there on the street. Everything bust. Martha rounded on it all by herself, she did. She did, what? She printed things about old Sam coming out for annexation. Here, here it is. Here, look at it. - Let me see that. - For annexation? 'There's your miracle, Mr. Burke.' Let Jones have his session now. - Tom admitted all these? - He did, sir. - And the trouble at the Pecos? - Yes, sir. Burke was speaking the truth. And there speaks the voice of the Republic, Mr. President. We can't fail them now. Well, so be it. Oh. Well, Mr. Burke. I owe you an apology, son. - We've done you injustice. - Well, sir... You must admit my mistake was an honest one. - Yes, sir. - Thank you, sir. Good day. I suppose, I ought to thank you. For what? For printing the truth? What changed your mind about me? I found out that, what you told President Jones was true. But I haven't changed my mind about you. Oh! It's hard to believe that a man like you could be bought. That's in your mind, I won't try to change it. I'm going home tomorrow, my business is finished here. I don't like leaving a quarrel between us. No quarrel, Dev. Just disappointment. You're a strange woman. - Am I? - Yeah. But still, a lot of woman. We can't fail. We'll push the treaty on the first ballot. Then build our empire. We'll have our own army and navy... Craden. Have you seen this? - "Houston favors annexation." - What's that? Austin's been turned into a mad house. They're howling in the streets like an insane mob. And all because of your friend, Miss Ronda. How dare she prints such a lie? - Unfortunately, it's not a lie. - But, Sam... I warned you about Houston. He misled us from the beginning. Forget Houston. Send him in swings one way and another. They'll howl themselves and do as they're told. But Congress meets tomorrow. They'll kill the treaty. They'll vote annexation. There'll be no vote. Until sentiment changes, Congress won't meet. How will you stop? With guns. Send the men. Tell my friends I need 'em here tomorrow morning. Si, senor. Come in the house, gentlemen. Hold that, son. Burke, my boy. I'm glad I caught you. We're in trouble. Big trouble. Tom Craden's gone crazy. He's organized an army to stop Congress from voting. And he can do it too, son. Aren't there men in Austin who'll stand up against him? - Against Craden? - We'll be outgunned. That's why you've got to take charge. Without you, our boys will scatter at the first shot. - Just a minute. - You got to stay, Dev. - How many men can you raise? - Well, 10, 20. - You Senator Crockett? - The same. I can raise me. Well, boys, what do you think? - You can count on me and Bud. - I'm with you, Dev. And don't forget me. Mizette? My friend, you're insane. This is madness. If Mr. Craden does not kill you, the Mexicans will and for what? Didn't ask you that. Can I deal you in? One man against twenty. Only a fool would try against such odds. - Am I fool? - Yes. I am a fool. You have comedy. But I'm warning you, if we lose, we'll be considered traitors. Craden and his men will hang the lot of us. I do not like your friend, Monsieur Craden. - I will stay. - So will I. We'll all stay. Alright, send out for your men. Mr. Burke, I thought you said "A smart man knows when he's whipped." Who says I'm smart? Make this, boys. Keep throwing it in. Keep this place clear in here. We got some more senators to come in. It's unlikely they'll come through here 'but we've gotta be covered.' - It's about time. - Howdy, Claud. - Hiya, Jim. - Howdy, Claud. Got here soon as we could. Been riding all night. Glad you could make it. We need every man. - I hear there'll be trouble. - Never can tell. That's what I figured. Old Betsy's hankering. - Fine. Fine. - 'Senator Demmet.' These the men you've been waiting? - Last of them. - I'll hitch your horses. Leave your rig there. We'll use it as barricade. - You heard what he said. - Yes, sir. Gentlemen, this is Dev Burke, a Texan. He's in-charge here. - How do you do? - What do you want us to do? - I think you men go inside. - Let you do the fighting? - That ain't fair. - That's what we're here for. - You'll need our gunsmen. - Right now, we need your votes. We might as well go in and get it over with. Gentlemen, gentlemen! President Jones is ready to convene Congress. He asks that you take your seats. Come along, gentlemen, please. That ought to be enough. Alright, get your gun. I'll check on the men inside. I guess it's my turn to thank you, Dev. 'For what?' You were on your way home. Well, I missed a stake. Besides, if I stay around, I might still make a deal. You don't fool me. There's enough money in the world to make a man do this. They're comin'. They're comin'. Craden and his men, they're coming. Take cover. They're coming. They're coming, Mr. Burke. The whole army. We'll dust off the welcome mat for 'em. - These all the men we got? - They'll do. It's a good thing, I got an extra gun. - You better go. - Perhaps if I talk to Tom. It won't help. You know that as well as I do. He won't listen But, Dev.. You go find a place now where you'll be safe. Minni. Mind you, don't get hurt. I repeat, that due to the circumstances I consider it my duty to present you with the terms of the Mexican treaty. Secretary Smith, will you proceed? "Be it known that the following conditions shall bind "the Republic of Mexico and the Republic of Texas to it. Article one." Alright, boys. Now, listen to me. I don't want Craden to know how many men we've got. Luther, take these men here and go inside. You'll be in-charge. - I wanna stay out with you. - Are you gonna gimme trouble? Do as I tell you. Take Bud here with you. They're comin'. Here they come. Alright, everybody, get to the stockade. Alright, fellas, in your places. Looks like they're expecting us. - Where are they? - I'll find out. You men, stay here. Interesting, no? Do you think they are angry? One might say so. And one might be right. Hold your fire. What are you doin' here, Burke? There's no profit in this, you know. And you're the fools. What are you getting out of it? You have members of Congress in your outfit? 'I do.' The president want them to take their places. If they don't? Then legislation will proceed without them. I doubt it. How could you get mixed up in a mess like this? Politics isn't for pretty girls like you. It's for old battle-axes like me. They're only a handful. Let's rush 'em. Get all those barricades and get at those gates. Let's go! So glad we're shootin'. I'm back in shape again. Darn. Ripped again in the same damn spot. This ain't gonna stop you, Mr. Kilgore. Remember them hundred Comanches you fought with your bare teeth? What teeth? I'm against this treaty and always have been. I move we adjourn. Sit down, you're out of order. They've cuttin' storm first, Tom. They got more guns than you reckon. Ride out, men. Ride out! Out! Good shooting, fellas. That will hold them for a while. Now let's rebuild this barricade. '"Article 14, the Republic agrees and covenants.."' I think your friend Craden is planning some kinda surprise. Yeah. Take it on the run and cut loose in time to get away. When that hole opens up, ram those gates. Take it away! Inside, everybody! Get the timbers and raise that gate. This is most discouraging. - Think Texas is worth all this? - I hope so. It better be. This time we carry the gates. Kill every men who gets in your way. Let's go! "Article 27..." That can't have more articles than a country store. - I move the treaty be rejected. - And I second the motion. Go on, Secretary Smith. Why are we sitting here when there are traitors to be killed? I move we go outside. Have some exercise. If you love Texas, follow me. "Article 27.." It's Houston! 'Sam Houston.' 'Sam Huston's here.' Hold your fire. Hold your fire! - Are you responsible for this? - I am. He was trying to stop us from voting, Sam. He'd have done it too, if it hadn't been for this man. Geronimo told me you're troubled at the Pecos. I came as soon as I could. It's lucky you did, sir. By what right do you interfere with the work of Congress, Tom? This is still a Republic. 'No person has the right to put his interest' above that of the people. You're guilty of treason. And you're guilty of selling us out. Let them fight it out. They'll be no good for Texas themselves, until they do. Come away, child. We don't want to see this. This is for the favor at the river. Come on, you bull headed. Ah! Pick him up. 'Let that be an end to it.' And an end to Texan fighting Texan. The Mexican Army stands ready to march against us. The moment we vote for annexation But don't let that alarm you. Zach Taylor, will be at the Red River with troops from The States. Waiting to help us. Alright, you Texans. The enemy's on our border. Who's riding South? Oh, Dev-Dev. I was so afraid. Are you going South, with the others? Would you expect me not to? No. You know, you're a strange man? But quite a lot of man. Hey, Dev! We're riding out, you coming with us? Mizette, give the flag to a man, who is big enough to carry it.
