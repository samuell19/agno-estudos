The war between the Z-Bots and humans raged 300 years ago. Their firepower overwhelmed the unprepared human race. These robots were programmed to erase all the living things on Earth. Slowly we began to find ways to fight back. Our scientists developed a scramble drive that could be jammed into the Z-Bots and make them immobile. The Z-Bot central command figured out our tactics and began to concentrate their attack on our science center. We had to adjust our plans and figure out another way to fight back. The human race moved underground to survive the robotic genocide. We did what we needed to do to make it to another day. And somehow the hope of life continued. Our soldiers fought bravely, but we were outgunned, so we had to come up with a solution to stop them once and for all. We created a mega-EMP bomb, the magnitude of which we could never imagine, but it would mean that we would erase everything we've ever known and that we would have to start from the very beginning. And on Liberation Day, we put our plan into action. The Z-Bots ceased to operate, and we were free to build our world back, back to a time where we could be free to live our lives. Little did we know that the Z-Bot central command was infected by alien nanobot technology which lay dormant in the scattered ruins of their destroyed carcasses, where they waited for their time to strike back. Why is the alarm sounding? What? Diagnostic alpha. Control Team... I'm showing a major firewall breach at the plant. We have a code Z at the plant. Do you copy? Alpha negate. Propagate Apex Predator Function. I repeat-- We have a code Z! Code Z! Do you copy?! Control Team! Juniper! This is the Los Angeles City Power Control Team! We have confirmed a firewall breach and have already alerted HQ, but this is not a standard breach! We need any details you can provide! Mila, run diagnostics check. Running now. HQ, do you come in?! Is this another Z-Bot attack ripping through the power station? HQ, do you copy?! This isn't a Z-Bot code. This is something new. Oh, my God. It's heading straight for the plant turbines. I'm implementing an ad hoc defense code ASAP. Ask for HQ protocol. If we cannot get ahold of them, we have to stop this attack. Per protocol, we need a sliding base and alternate between quinary and hex. The default should be a malware function, full attack. It's already rerouting power. Send the ad hoc code through... now! If it reroutes the power station to the entire grid, we and HQ will be totally powerless against another robot attack. Per protocol, we're gonna have to implement a full code attack just to contain it. Well, do it! Send it now! We have to stop this thing! If it gets out of the plant, it'll be at the city in a manner of minutes, maybe less. This buys HQ maybe five minutes to respond if we're lucky. Oh, no. It's aimed right at us. We're under attack! Code Z! Code Z! Juniper! This is Kensley at Command! You need to evacuate the plant immediately! Juniper, get out of the plant now! It's fully overriding the system. It's breached everything! There's nothing we can do to stop this! HQ! HQ! Come in, HQ! We've confirmed a full firewall breach! The robots are back. The robots are back! Well, well, well. Look what we have here. Man, I've not shot a Z-Bot with one of these things in a long time. It's been almost 20 years. I just can't believe we found another fully stocked bunker. Hey, I told you we could have fought the war for another decade the way we kept this place stocked. Just imagine what we're gonna have in a few years. Like what? Aboveground farms? Yes, and the city is gonna be active with the... Restaurants. Restaurants. People out just enjoying food, not rationing it. Music concerts. Sports. And we could do one of those, um... What's the old-world term? Uh... Night on the town. Yeah. Things from before the war. Guys. We're not gonna have a night out on the town if we don't keep working. Besides, my pen's almost out of ink. I should have brought a backup. Maybe you should try going digital instead. You might get an accurate count this time. Maybe you should spend less time on your tablet. Isn't that contraband? Yeah, and the war's been over since, what, before you were born? Looks like we got another Z-Bot brain here from the very last war. Found this up on level three. And check this out. Still got a makeshift scramble drive jammed in there to fry its brain. Must be an inside joke. Man, I have not seen one of these in a long time. Bag it, and tag it. What's your name, Councilor? Oh. Yeah, I joined the Council a long time ago. I'm a retired sergeant. Electromagnetic pulse specialist Agnes Oros. - This is my son Trevor. - Sir. My daughter Reena. Nice to meet you. I'm Colonel Evander Wilks. You, too, huh? Sergeant Mark Oros... sir. Hey, Trev... you know Reena doesn't like using the tech, either. Yeah, yeah, I know. I got it. Safety over efficiency. Okay, listen. When we're done here, why don't you answer the Council's recruitment letter? Join the Coding Defense Team. You can code on your tablet all day, every day. Thanks, Mom. You know, Lieutenant May said the code I sent in got a perfect score. Yeah. I'm proud of you. You know, Reena's not the only one who doesn't like using tech. Beginning of the war, people used to find whatever nontech they could that was undetectable. They made metal clubs? Yeah, they're called... What are they called? Baseball bat. I didn't snag this 'cause I like antiques. A lot of us vets don't like using digital tech at all. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. We need a medic. Ah, no. Don't bother. Reconstruction Division's short on doctors. They're still getting everything staffed up. This is just an old war wound. - I'm in no hurry. - Okay. This thing goes up at least four levels, anyway. Come on. Appreciate that. You guys got that light in your eyes. Aboveground generation. You don't get scared every time something turns on around you. You don't have to think about all those tech myths the parents of my generation had to think about. Like what? Myths my grandparents used to talk about. Bots that could do anything. Bots as big as this planet. Bots like gods... evil gods. Like a T.C. What's a T.C.? It's just another one of those myths. But a little fear can be healthy, right? Agnes, you look familiar. Formerly Sergeant Agnes Gura. Ah, yes, of course. My condolences. I heard about David Gura. I'm grateful for everything you and he did during the war. Saved thousands of us. Large-scale EMP bombs, huh? - That's correct. - Hmm. Well, with all the things we'll be working on together, I guess it makes us family now, huh? And we certainly have our work cut out for us. I know the Council wants to preserve these old Z-Bots for research. I want to destroy them. The technology's so old, anyway. We can't repurpose them. And half of this stuff was useless even when we were hiding underground. Rocket launchers from the 2000s. Hey. Hey! I let it slide this morning. You know better. No computerized tech. Well, Mark, I seem to remember a couple years ago, when our actual dad was still alive-- That almost sounded like ordnance. No, that was ordnance. I'm getting an alert from the Council. It says the four generators downtown by the headquarters, they turned into robots. What? Yeah, robots! Is it another Z attack? It doesn't say. - Power it down. - What? You know the rules. If we're ever under attack... - No more digital. - Yeah, Mom. I got it. I know. But I could use it to hack what's attacking us. Power it down, son. This could be a lot worse than you think it is. That came from inside the building! Let me try and hack 'em. There's no time. We have to get to Council Headquarters. Turn that tablet off now! What the hell is that?! Go! Run! Get out! Grab the weapons! Hurry! Get out of the building! There's no charge! You gotta hack it, like we did in the war. Be careful, or it'll go up in a fireball. Mom, no! We're completely sealed off! What about Mom?! We'll have to find another way. Where are we going? These new bots might be able to hear us. They might even have heat detection, like the ones we fought during the war. Why isn't it leaving? Maybe it's following us. What? Go. Go. Reena, go. Hurry! It's getting closer! - Go! Go! - Colonel. Colonel, come on! Let's go! Colonel! Colonel! Colonel, no! Colonel! Come on! Come on! Trevor, help. My coat is stuck. Go. Go. Go. Down to the right here. This way. This way. Go. Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. It's following us. Go quietly. Go quietly. It's still following us. The colonel said it could have heat detection. Trevor! There! The hot steam should give us some cover! Go! Go! Here's the situation. Prime Minister, we have transmorphed technology here, here, and right here. Our Z-Bot alert systems already gave me a full report, General. We're gonna put down this attack quickly. Our strike force is already getting 'em from the air. Prime Minister, I think it's gonna take more than that. I mean, this isn't Z-Bot technology. Our defense coding and our tech teams don't even know what this is. They're taking the form of robotic lions. Lions? Lions went extinct over 100 years ago. Well, I think maybe they're mimicking our logo? Or maybe it's something else. We don't know. But we do know this. - They're not just in the city. - Mm-hmm. They're all around the southwestern territory. - Southwestern territory? - Yes, sir. That's thousands of square miles. You need to make this make sense to me. Last time I checked, we have the only semistate data cloud in the world. I mean, a Z-Bot trying to break in would be like an infant trying to break into a carbon-fiber prison. Prime Minister-- This headquarters was designed specifically to run a post-algorithmic signal to shield our entire planet. Sir, it's because this is hybrid technology. We don't know. The power plant's computer has designated it an A.P.F. A.P.F.? It's an apex predator function. We haven't been able to get deep enough into the programming to understand its prime directive, but whenever one of these things comes in contact with a mechanical device, turn into a hunt-and-kill robot. Yeah, this is way more advanced than any Z-Bot we fought in the war. This--This sort of A.P.F., it operates under 4 terahertz. Now, that's nanobot technology. Tech guys have managed to get a rendering of this image after doing an element profile. - This object... - Yeah. is nanotech scale? Yes, sir. Does this mean our global server is vulnerable? It's possible, sir. If Defense Coding can't figure out what the program is, we could have a breach in the firewall. As it is now, they tell me our firewall is 100% secure. Issue the Anthracite Protocol. Nothing digital is safe. Nothing with computerized language. Nothing with a processor. Nothing. And have the bunker retrofitted with an analog radio, analog data lines. But keep the server online until I tell you differently. - You understand? - Yes, sir. Trevor! Reena! I'm gonna try calling them again. Oh, no. If you keep calling, it's just gonna draw the bots to us. Those bots are coming for us either way. I gotta try. Trevor. Reena. Come in. Trevor, Reena, this is Mom! Come in! It's no use. I'm gonna call Brady at Global Headquarters. Are you sure? I mean, he's probably been evaced out of HQ to a bunker in the desert. He said if I ever needed a favor, call him. This is that favor. We'll need it to direct the Global Military Divisions. And have the bunker have analog weapons, antiques, like those, uh, automatic rifles, fully loaded. Prime Minister. Sir, you're getting a priority-one radio transmission from the Van Ryberg Center. Who's calling? It's Sergeant Agnes Oros, sir. Agnes Oros? From the Liberation Day Battle. Oros specializes in this kind of warfare. She and David Gura defeated the Z-Bots using electromagnetic bombs. We'll evacuate at 1405 to Bunker Theta. Sir, that's inside headquarters. We have a 10-story bunker in the eastern desert. With this threat, we aren't gonna do anything that exposes us to danger outside of these walls. We gotta be getting closer. Cut the city power grid. Get me regular updates from Coding Defense on how to kill these things. And have them read over the radio. Nothing electronic. Then I want you to call in a major airstrike to L.A. City everywhere... once we know people are back underground. No nukes. Uh, sir, are you suggesting that we take the people back underground? We've just spent the last 20 years bringing them aboveground. Yes, they're going back underground. I know everybody's gonna be mad 'cause they got a taste of life aboveground, but you reassure them, by the end of the day, it's gonna be safe to go back aboveground. Also tell 'em this attack will not be tolerated. Yes, sir. Agnes. Brady. I'm calling in that favor. I figured as much. I'm sending in an immediate evac and advance warships. That's not it. It's my kids. My two kids, Reena and Trevor, they're trapped inside the Van Ryberg Center. Prime Minister... the other Council members have demanded an airstrike, Spear Fighter Craft. That's a suicide mission. An airstrike? They could transmorph the planes. The attack is already under way. The outposts insisted that we stop these Z-Bots immediately. Agnes... there's an airstrike on the way there, and the Van Ryberg Center... is a hot spot. David went back for you. 20 years ago, those Z-Bots launched an attack on a chemical plant, and you couldn't get out. Now, it took years to show effects, but if he... if he hadn't gone in, he'd still be here. Hmm. If you're gonna launch a massive attack on this compound, we've got 65 minutes to prep. Send in the elite rescue team, the primary S&R unit. We're gonna need all the help we can get. If we fail to contain this threat quickly, your expertise in electromagnetic bombs is gonna be crucial to our defense. I'll help you with whatever you want soon as I know my kids are safe. I'll have you and your family brought back here after the rescue. Mark. I know. It's war again. Move it! Come on! Heading around. Reload! Reload! Someone cover me! Someone cover me! Watch out! Attention. Attention. All strike force pilots, code Z. Code Z. Report to flight deck immediately. - Sir. - At ease. Have you been briefed yet? Right before I entered. Good. We need to get this right, or-- We will. Target? The Van Ryberg Center? That place isn't even built yet. Like I said, we need to get this right. What if this is only a drill? How many of these skirmishes have we done in the past 10 months? It's always a false alarm. Not this time. We have confirmed sightings in New Los Angeles City. Look, you're a good pilot, Private Connor. Do you know why the Council never rejects a recruit to our flight team? Sir, I'm sorry. Because we lost tens of thousands of men and women on Liberation Day, and now we're constantly scrambling to find enough pilots. Sir, I'm not trying to make excuses. Normally we have time to run a preflight diagnostic. You're right. We need to know exactly what we're dealing with. And I have one of these for backup. A scramble drive? Won't that wipe the jet's operating system? It's an old trick we used during the war. Sir, it's been a long time since the war. We've been using tech constantly since I've been here. Do you really think we'll need to use something like that? Trust me, it's better to have it and not need it. Copy that, sir. Do you hear that? That's a warm-up. Pilots your age. They always seem to have the same complaint. Too many drills. Never seen a robot. Well, that is why we run so many drills. We've been preparing you for exactly what's happening today. Let's go. Listen, all this, everything aboveground, it was all smoke and rubble during the war. The sky was black. It rained round the clock. Anyone aboveground was almost instantly killed by Z-Bots. I've never seen a Z-Bot in real life. Well, today's your lucky day. Although I'd like to think we're better prepared to handle them now than we were 20 years ago. Can they really disguise themselves as any piece of tech? Yes. My squad leader told me they were in the hell sector. My squad leader thought that he could hack into an old tank, not to turn it on, but to try and steal the pulse cannon on the front. I'm assuming it didn't go well. No, it did not. We were trying to get to a collapsed supply depot, about 100 men and women. The ammunition charger transmorphed first. 25 people were shredded in seconds. Everyone surged forward screaming. The tank transmorphed next, and all of a sudden, the entire place lit up, everyone shooting in all directions. But it was too late. I woke up in a triage with half my insides missing. I'm sorry, sir. Six generations fighting a war from underground. You have no idea how good you've had it. I was 25 years old when I saw the sun for the first time. Sir, what about the jets? Won't they transmorph? Well... that's why we run the pre-flight check. We planned for that exactly. And if all else fails, we've got the scramble drive. Mm-hmm. Look, the firewalls we use on the jets, the tech we've developed, it's all Z-Bot-proof. I tested it myself personally. Then why do we need the scramble drive? Stopping destructive code is a technique we had to learn to survive. Tech synced. Synced. Good. Let's move. Q-Bots spotted. Prepare to engage. Copy that, Captain. Weapons armed and ready on your signal. We need to get directly over them first. We can't afford to miss any shots. Copy that, Captain. Q-Bots on the attack! Engage! Copy that, Captain! We'll take care of them just like we took care of the ones in the city. Can you still hear it? Come on, Reena. Let's go. It spotted us. Is it able to network with the others, let them know where we are? I don't know. But I don't want to find out. Let's go. There's a door at the end of the tunnel. We can seal this one shut, too. "Apex predator function"? What kind of program's that? - Run! - Go down! Go down! We need to find weapons! We need to escape this place! Can you still hear it? It's still down here. It sounds like it might be two or three levels above. Should we keep going down? Mom is probably up there right now with the rescue team looking for us. Mom, this is Trevor. Come in. Mom, Mark, this is Trevor and Reena. We're here inside the tunnels. Come in. Mom, Mark, it's Reena and Trevor. - Come in. - Nothing. That attack destroyed a huge section of the building. And it's not like these things just stopped once we got inside. Mom and Mark could be miles away now, just to stay safe while the military fights them. We could be down here for a while. We don't know how far down these tunnels go. Or how sensitive the bots' heat detection is. I know. I know. Or if we're gonna hit a dead end. Hey, hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, what's wrong? Are you having a panic attack? - Yeah. - Hey, hey, it's okay. Come on. - Yeah. - Hey, hey. I can't--I can't think. - Shh. Breathe. - Can't breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Do you remember this? We used to do this when you were a kid. Yeah. Yeah, I remember. I'm sorry. I know this isn't helping. - Shh. Look at me. - I'm sorry. Look at me. It's okay. We're gonna be okay, all right? - Okay. Okay. - The human race was down here for 300 years and managed to make it. Right? Mom and Dad fought down here their whole lives and won the war. - Okay. Okay. - It's okay. It's okay. And you know Mom's not gonna stop until we're rescued. And with all the lions attacking, there's no way the military isn't focusing on this place. All right? Plus Mom and Mark work for the Council. All right? They've gotta be trying to rescue people. Listen, I think our best bet is to get as many doorways, hatches, and steam pipes between us and that lion as possible. But what if we hit a dead end? What if there's more tech down here that can turn itself on and transmorph? Mom said they used these tunnels during the war. All right? We'll find some weapons we can use. Weapons we can't use. Reena, we can't fight them with a baseball bat. Yeah, but a baseball bat can't turn itself into something that can hunt you and rip you to pieces. Damn it. That lion just keeps coming. We need to go. Let's go. Let's go. Go! Go! Shit. It found us. Now what? Trevor, wait! It's totally computerized! We need to shut the door! Let's go! Welcome to the command center, Prime Minister. We have carbon-reinforced concrete to protect against any mechanical lions coming in. Analog weaponry. Yes, it's not a laser rifle, but at least it can't be transmorphed. I want you to meet our elite lieutenants, Lieutenant May, Lieutenant Ryan. At ease. Do we know if there's nanobots inside the wiring in these devices? We're running a resistance tracker along our circuits now, sir. And while our platoons are out there defending us, have you found a way to hack 'em? Negative, sir. Both Tech Team and Coding Defense have sent a barrage of covert hellfire code, but the Q-Bots receiving the signals spit it right back at us. They fried one of the servers on the side of the HQ. Q-Bot? Yes, sir. Tech Team designated them as Quadrupedal Robots, or Q-Bots for short. These Q-Bots attacking downtown, they were transmorphed because of nanobots hidden inside of digital tech throughout the city. What's our Tech Team doing? As of 1439, the Q-Bots have killed all members of the Tech Team at the power plant and destroyed all their equipment. Can you give me an ad hoc diagnosis? Prime Minister, an ad hoc diagnosis won't detect anything in the metal in our circuits. Without the Tech Team to run an element profile directly, physically on our circuits, we have no way of knowing if there are nanobots lying dormant in our headquarters. So these Q-Bots could be in this bunker. They could even be in this room. Is that right? Jesus. The attacking Q-Bots are now within two miles of our location. Should I send out a phalanx order, sir? Negative. Troops are to maintain their search-and-destroy formation, please. General, we have a malevolent programming alarm along wireless transmission and network cables. They're bombarding our system, sir. Firewall's at 98%. So the Q-Bots have made progress against our firewall. Sir... out of an abundance of caution, I think we should power down our global server immediately. That's a negative. We need to keep the server active to the very last minute. But, sir, we can't risk-- Stand down, Lieutenant. In case you've forgotten, the Council's primary function isn't just to protect the planet from malevolent spyware. It's also to coordinate our Global Armies for defense. Prime Minister. I have new intel from our manual diagnostics. These transmissions... they have realigned in a radial pattern directed straight at headquarters. So the Q-Bots are directed at headquarters? Once it breached the cursory layers of our firewall, it was able to detect the nature of our operations. So they now know how powerful our server is. - That's correct, General. - Oh, my God. And it's utilizing all of its hacking resources to try and seize control of it. And if it does? It could transmit a signal around the world using our server. Firewall's at 97% now, sir. This isn't just a random viral signal. It shows a defined sequence set to turn every piece of tech into a Q-Bot within 12 hours. Lieutenant Ryan, I need you to go to the server room. Power down each server manually. Take analog weapons, and take backup support. I need this fire put out now. Yes, sir. Lieutenant May, I need you to run a program at 4 terahertz. Scramble it through our system. That should prevent them from reactivating any of those Q-Bots. My guess is they're trying to... damage our defense system. That search and rescue at the Van Ryberg Center, it can't fail, okay? Because right now, Agnes and her EMP expertise is the only arrow in our quiver that can pierce their defense. These Q-Bots are relentless. If we can't shake 'em, Search and Rescue's gonna have a real hard time clearing off the landing zone, and they're not gonna be able to pick us up. Well, they're not gonna retreat. You're right. But we have to find Trevor and Reena. We're not leaving without my kids. And after we find them, we have to find a way out of this zone. I have an idea. Open up the sensor on the back of your rifle. I'm gonna make an EMP bomb. What, you're gonna overload the generator on the rifle? I'm gonna create a feedback loop. Unfortunately it's gonna fry your rifle, but it's also gonna send a pulse that'll fry every lion within a 100-yard radius on the ground. It shouldn't interfere with Search and Rescue, and it should give us some time to get to a landing zone. After we find the kids. And then... we could find Prime Minister Grady and make him the EMP bomb he wants. Go! Run! What was that?! They fired our electromagnetic pulse right back at us. Mark, an EMP doesn't affect these things. Search and Rescue, come in. We need immediate evac. Search and Rescue, do you copy? If they disabled our weapons, they most likely disabled Search and Rescue's, too. I hope Trevor and Reena are okay. Hey. Mark, if anything happens to them... I know. We will find them. Okay. Let's move. Captain Watts, the weapons aren't releasing! Affirmative on my end as well! I'm engaging the scramble drive. That will give all nearby jets a five-second hard reboot and should get those bots out of our jets. Agnes, the airstrike is closing in. There'll be there in less than four minutes. You gotta hurry. The reboot didn't work! We have to warn the Prime Minister. Get down! Twelve hours... until they seize the most powerful computer system on Earth. Hey, Mark... I'm not leaving without Trevor and Reena. I'd rather get ripped apart before I leave them. Then we find them, and we get 'em out of here, or we both get ripped apart. I do not care how long it takes. I will fight this damn war until all of us are safe. We need some conventional weapons. No circuits. No nothing. Those are ancient artifacts. I mean, are they even still gonna be functional? There has to be something we can use. We don't have any choice. Over there. They don't have a single computer chip in 'em. Might as well have been made by cavemen. You know how to use one of these? Load it. Safety off. Shoot. That's the girl I married. Let's go get my kids. Do they think they moved this part of the tunnel so it'd make it hard for unwanted bots? I assume so. But with all the tech able to transmorph, I doubt it'll do us much good. Wait a second. What is it? Wait. Is that a hard-wire code junction? It is. If there's any more tech down here that can kill us... if we can cross the code patch... we can scramble their directives. Not with these Q-Bots, Trevor. The people at HQ spent all day and night generating code to prevent tech from transmorphing. No, I know, but there's a ton of tech down here, including from the war. The Z-Bots... if we come across one and it activates, we're not gonna be able to fight it. We'll need it to see us as an ally, even if it's just for a minute. If it's a Z-Bot, it'll have to be wired in. You've seen the work that Mom did. When they shut those things down, they put them in a containment unit plugged in. If we find one... this ought to do it. Then the Z-Bots won't see us as a threat. All right? All right? Come on. Dead end. We have to go back. Go back? Reena, if we go back, we're gonna run right into 'em. No. We're trapped. No! This can't be it. At least we can open one of those panels down there and hide inside. It's better than nothing. Plus there might be one more air shaft or something inside so we can climb through. I don't see how we're gonna get these open. I bet that'll do it, though. Have you lost your mind?! When is it gonna sink into you that this technology is dangerous? Every time you've tried to hack something, we've almost died. Besides, it might turn into a lion. You don't think I realize that? I mean, what other choice do we have? But--But you don't think I know? Know what? Reena, the only reason that we're still alive right now is because of you. If you wouldn't have used the baseball bat to collapse the ceiling, we wouldn't even be here right now, all right? I wouldn't have had anything to stab into the lock to get us into the tunnel, and I wouldn't have had anything to bash that pipe with. Trevor, look, using zero tech is not a right or wrong choice. - I'm saying-- - I know what you're saying. Reena, I know what you're saying. I get it now. I do, but by the time we even make a dent in one of these panels with this baseball bat, the lion'll be here. Look, my way definitely is not the right way... but it's the only way right now. You ready? - Whoa. Slow, slow, slow. - Trevor, look out. - Slow. - Slow doesn't matter. They can detect heat. It doesn't even look like they're activated. But look at that section there. The Resistance must have sent a power surge through them, shutting them down, and then ripped the connection out so the Z-Bots couldn't power themselves back up. But that lion just keeps coming. Okay, what if-- I know this sounds totally insane, but what if we turn the Z-Bots back on? What? Reena, what are you talking about? Did we not just get done saying that activating tech was dangerous? Yeah, but their programming language is decades outdated, remember? Even that colonel said it was worthless. What if the lions can't take them on? They might start attacking the Z-Bots, and then the Z-Bots will fire back. Right. Wh-Whoa! That touch screen was a robot. We gotta turn 'em on. Look, if this goes badly, I'm sorry. There. Okay. Here goes nothing. Scanning area for imminent threats. Just--Just stay still. Apex Predator attack: imminent. What is your objective? Apex Predator attack: imminent. Objective: world domination. Primary resistance: eliminate A.P.F. It's giving us its basic programming. Z-Bot, do you have an Apex Predator function? Negative. Baseline: Z-Bot. Function: artificial intelligence and military strategy. Targeted for elimination: lion robot hybrid. Status: Quadrupedal robots will attack Global Council Headquarters. It's giving us the Quadrupeds' basic programming. The Z-Bots would scan humans to determine their objective, strategies, and where they're heading next. It just told us where the lions are planning their attack, so it must have scanned the lions' neural network. Do you think the Z-Bots are on our side? If they are on our side... if we have them on our side, then they can help us destroy the remaining lions. Until they come for us. Sir, I got a priority message from the soldiers in the field. They're almost completely overrun by the Q-Bots. They'll pulling every available soldier they can find to protect the perimeter to within two square blocks, sir. Lieutenant Ryan, I need the status update. Please tell me you and the Tech Team have powered down these servers. Sir, the Q-Bots' assault on our firewall managed to reroute some of the flow of power to other sections of the system. It's tough to keep up with their hack, but I'm working on it. As far as a total tech takeover worldwide... we now have seven hours remaining. Where's the rest of the Tech Team, Lieutenant? This is full Anthracite Protocol. K.I.A., sir. Defending the HQ at the outer perimeter. Oh, God. Sir... I came across a piece of alien code while deactivating some of the systems on the server, and I was able to translate some of it. Seems the code is directing these Q-Bots toward something called Total Convergence, but I don't know what they're converging or how to counteract it. They sure as hell aren't using our server to do it. Do not let the Q-Bots prevent us from shutting down this server. All right, General, how big a security detail can you put together to get us up in the server room? All of our personnel is in the field defending HQ. Well, then we're gonna go, and we all are gonna shut it down. We also can't have 'em access anything in this bunker. - Lieutenant May. - Yes, sir. Continue monitoring this room. - Make sure nothing reactivates. - Yes, sir. This is the Resistance War all over. Private, grab a weapon. It's all hands on deck. Yes, sir. Lieutenant! We're outside the door! General, the nanobots have taken over the technology! You can't use it! Gonna have to open this manually. - It's not gonna be easy. - You're right. Lana! A little help. Lieutenant, we've taken out the magnetic lock! We need your help from the inside! Copy that, sir! This way. All right, Lieutenant, I want all of this to go dark. I don't want to hear - so much as a cooling fan. - Yes, sir. Tell us what to do, and we'll do it. Well, first we need to go over here to the secondary hub. We have to work backward, like fighting a fire. Okay. Our meta-linguistic scans are constantly regenerating, but if we unplug the secondary backup hub, they've got nowhere to go. Now, this cube is a semistate conduit. If unplugged, it cuts off all wireless signal from around the world, going into and out of the server. If I take this cube, and I plug it into the semistate port, it'll redirect our entire quantum A.I. sequence onto this external drive. What's happening? Holy moley. Get out now! Lana, get behind me! Everything is completely destroyed. If anyone can hear us, this is Trevor and Reena Gura. Main Council, come in. I repeat-- Main Council, come in. It sounds like anybody that could help us is either under attack or dead by now. Listen, we need to get to the headquarters. All right? If Mom and Mark are gonna be anywhere, it's gonna be there. All right? Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. There might be some weapons inside that Council patrol car we can use. If there are, we can't use them. They run on at least some tech. There's that alarm. It's everywhere. It's gotta be a signal coming from the Q-Bots. If that's the case, then right now, we're totally surrounded. We're at least a mile from the headquarters. If we call, they might be able to send some troops to help us. - Is that a car? - Let's go. We'll have to be quiet. I don't know this for sure, but I'm guessing the lion-bots have more than just-- Whoa. Whoa. Go. Run! Run! - Up here! Up here! - Go! Go! Go! Get down. Get down. Get down. Damn it! I don't understand. The Z-Bots scanned the neural network of the Quadrupeds. They knew where they were going. They should have seen this attack coming, right?! We've got to get ahold of the Council! Global Council, this is Trevor Gura. We need immediate rescue outside the headquarters. I think the radio is dead. These things run on old-world batteries. - We're pinned down. - Z-Bot! Record my voice, and transmit the message to all audio speakers in range! But that will--that will draw the Q-Bots' attention. At this point, we've already got their attention. Mom, Mark, Global Council, this is Trevor and Reena Gura! We're heading in to the headquarters with friendly Z-Bots. Do not open fire on us! I repeat-- do not fire on us! Z-Bot, transmit audio. Mom, Mark, Global Council, this is Trevor and Reena Gura! We're heading in to the headquarters with friendly Z-Bots. Do not open fire on us! I repeat-- do not fire on us! You ready? Thank God. They're alive. They're alive, but they're not safe. There's no such thing as a Z-Bot allied with a human. Then we will go in, and we will separate them from whatever Z-Bot platoon there is. How did Trevor get a message through the loudspeaker system? Couldn't this just be a trap set up by the Z-bots? Or even the Q-Bots? I mean, there's--there's no way he hacked a Z-Bot, right? I don't know. During the war, the Z-Bots could record and transmit messages, but they were recordings, not simulations. And the Council recruited Trevor for the Coding Defense team for a reason. I think he used that bot to communicate. Even if the Z-Bots would work with the humans - against the Q-Bots-- - It's just a matter of time before the Q-Bots use their pulse to seize the Z-Bots. And we have no way of stopping them. Not even an EMP? You saw what the Q-Bots did when we detonated our rifles. They bounced our EMP right back at us. I gotta warn the Council. Sergeant Oros to Global Headquarters. This is Sergeant Oros to Global Headquarters, Priority Theta. Trevor, Reena, come in. We gotta get there. And if the Z-Bots gain access and they're seized, they could turn on us. Let's go. Get down. Those things are everywhere. They're airborne. They're roaming the buildings. Okay, go. Get to something that's burning. We are surrounded above and below. Everywhere. Okay, we keep moving. If we just stick to things that are burning, I think we'll make progress. We're only a few blocks out, but that next section of street, it's buckled, and not to mention the wreckage around it. A few more blocks. Come on. The firewalls in headquarters, they can't have much left. Even at 90%, we can't produce an EMP that's gonna do us any good. How about a nuclear option? No. We'd wipe out all the humans along with the Q-Bots. We gotta find another way. We're almost to HQ. But that is way too much open space between us and the main entrance. Yeah, it's over 100 yards. And we don't know how many lions are circling the building... even around the next corner. If we make a run for the HQ, I think their heat detection'll spot us immediately. But if we can make a big enough fire, I think it'll obscure it. At least they won't be able to get a lock on us. Yeah. The smoke might obscure their visual sensors as well. You know, there's probably a tool kit inside the cab of one of those transports. I can puncture an auxiliary fuel line, start an electric spark. Whole thing'd go up like a fireball. Let's do it. Torque dowel and hammer. Okay, that's all we need. I'm gonna keep watch. Just try to get it in one go so we don't draw any lions to us. One more ought to do it. Let's light it up. Keep going! Don't stop! Locked! That one. Down! Get down! Come on. Come on. Oh, all the digital locks are decommissioned. The soldiers inside must have done that. Oh, damn it. We're too exposed out here. You think they detected us? If they haven't, they will soon. They're starting to swarm. What is that? Where'd you get that? It's a pin from the safety latch of the rocket launcher. You're gonna pick the lock? We've been fighting the Resistance all our lives, and I have never seen you go all 21st century before. Ah. Old soldier taught me this. Told him I never wanted to get trapped behind an old-world door. Inside! We brought Trevor and Reena here enough. They should be smart enough to know to go to HQ's bunker. We can't go outside the building into the open again. Wait. The air in this hallway, it's--it's stale. The entire air circulation system's been shut down. Computerized. Of course. The sensors inside that system, they can't transmorph anymore. It'll buy us some time inside. Here. I'll give you a leg up. We're on level D, midlevel. Almost to the bunker, then. Agnes. My kids, are they here? I haven't had word from anybody about anything. I'm sorry. Trevor, Reena, come in! I'm sorry we couldn't do more to find your family. No, they said those Z-Bots we're actively guarding them. We don't know for sure that's changed. They're not safe, Mark. I'm gonna go out in the HQ floor by floor until I find them. That--That should be physically impossible, though, right? The server just turned into a Q-Bot. It's acquiring every piece of technology it can and turning it into a Q-Bot. What is this new Q-Bot? I don't know. I was too busy firing to see it. But it's bigger than anything else, and it keeps growing. It's acquiring everything it can. General Palmer, sir, we need an extradition force to get you and the prime minister out of here. All of our extradition forces are dead. The Q-Bots are taking over. We have one last chance to make a stand. Take it easy, General. Our sole objective is to destroy the new Q-Bot by any means necessary. We're gonna need an EMP blast orders of magnitude greater than anything you've ever wired up before. But you're gonna have to do it without me. I'm sorry. Prime Minister. Prime Minister. General. Come-- There are new variables that are a grave threat to the mission. When we were fighting the Q-Bots, Agnes trigged an improvised EMP to fry their circuits, but the Q-Bots bounced the signal right back at us and kept fighting like it was nothing. - Oh, God. - An EMP is not going to stop these lions, not even on a large scale. General. Sergeant. I was able to decipher some of the viral nanobot code. I know what Total Convergence is. This new Q-Bot isn't just going to transmorph every piece of tech. It wants to connect itself physically, not just digitally, to every piece of machinery everywhere to form a new weaponized organism. That's why they wanted control of our server, to transmit its signal around the world, not only turning every piece of tech into a weaponized bot, but to lay the groundwork for this new entity. What? And our server is so powerful that this Q-Bot can, what, break lesser firewalls on other continents? That's correct. This new organism will be all-seeing, all-sensing, omnipresent, easily able to kill every living thing on Earth. It'll almost be godlike. Oh, my God. That is Total Convergence. Almost like a... like a T.C. A Total Convergence Robot. It won't need to manufacture circuits or chips. It'd just combine everything into one entity. Wait. Wait, you said that the signal is being transmitted virally by nanobots? Correct. Wait a minute. That-- The wiring for that circuit is across from the armory. It's directly across from the armory. There's a locker down the hall on the right. Take that key. It has all antique weaponry. It's all analog weaponry. There's no wires, no nothing. General. Jesus! General. - Oh, God. - Ohh. It's worse than it looks, trust me. Come on. Come on. Gentlemen, I'm not gonna make it. Come on, General. He was my commanding officer when I first joined. Let's go flip that circuit. Low and slow. Eyes sharp. Come on. Agnes, the signal isn't being passed by the Q-Bots. It's being passed by the nanobots inside of them! So that's why the Q-Bots can keep fighting as if nothing happened. And it's why they can fire our electromagnetic pulses back at us. That should be physically impossible, right? Not on an atomic scale, it's not. The wavelength frequency of an EMP is between 100 megahertz and 100 gigahertz. It's wider than the nanoscopic scale. Get down! These analog Z-Bot-era laser cannons and some handheld grenades are a good start. Those are power banks just above us, probably transmorphing as we speak. I mean, isn't that where Agnes said she was going? She said she's going floor by floor. I gotta go back her up. Go. I'll stay here. We're not done just yet. Mark, they need you down there. No. Ryan's keeping watch, all right? We heard transmorphing machinery above us right in this area. I couldn't let you face it alone. I've haven't seen anything yet. There are power banks feeding the server rooms. They need technicians to maintain them, so they should be easy to find and destroy. Wait. Unless they've recessed back into the walls. We doing this?! Yes, we are. Okay, well, we did nice demo on the wall. You okay? Still here. We finally made it inside. Finally. We can thank the Z-Bots for destroying those Q-Bots, or we would have never made it in. I don't know how much safer we are in here. At least there's some more places we can hide in. Hopefully some weapons we can use, all right? Let's go. Let's go. - Wait. - What? When is the last time you've seen someone print this much material... on paper? If they were relaying info analog. Has to be related to the attack, right? It's just pages and pages of code. This is my code. This is my code. The data report shows they tried to use it to send a distress signal to the other territories around the world, but they were overrun by Q-Bots. They were overrun? Everywhere? They must have been real desperate if they tried to fire up a tech hub one last time. Damn. Look, this is a scramble drive. They tried to use this to defend the attack against the main server. They were too late. The Council's last transmission came from the main server here in the headquarters. They underwent a major code disruption. They're using the main server to transmorph all the remaining tech throughout the world into Q-Bots. Reena, they're attacking all over. And they're running a countdown program... called Total Convergence. It's gonna run out when it takes down all the remaining firewalls throughout the world. Reena, we gotta shut this thing down. What if the Z-Bots turn on us? Right now, they're our only viable weapon against Total Convergence, all right? Until they stop listening, we can use them. We'll go down, have them disguise themselves as computer banks... and then maybe can beat this thing ourselves. - All right? - Okay. Let's go. Here. Let's go. Man, it's burning hot down here. There must have been a huge firefight. Some of the areas are still smoldering. There is zero air coming through. I'm burning up. Yeah, me, too. Where's the safety on this thing? Does this even work? Yeah, it's right here. Did you think there would be instructions taped to the wall in the armory? Yeah, you know what? There should be. There is zero military down here. We need Mom, Mark, and about 500 troops. Like, 12 Q-Bots just marched inside. I thought we were done that time. The fires must have obscured their heat detection. Either way... something's wrong. This isn't right. Are the Z-Bots in position? Yeah. Their disguise as random computer banks must have worked, because the Q-Bots didn't fire on them, either. Then I guess it's all or nothing. It better be a hell of a lot more than that. Z-Bots, storm the server room! Trevor, Reena, stay down. Listen to me! That server is not an ordinary server! It has been transmorphed! It is extremely dangerous! Agnes, drill and kill formation. We can't just leave them. We need to fight. I'm with you. Let's go. We got you, guys! I'm out! Get down! What the hell was that?! We need to pull back! The Q-Bots just used an EMP to disable our Z-Bots! Oh, no. - Mom, come on. - Move! Move! I knew you guys would make it. Okay, we need to build a bomb, scorched earth. There's no time. Those Z-Bots you brought with you, they--they attacked the Q-Bot server. Their coding is so old the Q-Bots can't seize control of them. We have an army of Z-Bots. They're in storage in the armory. We can't activate an army of Z-Bots here. - It's suicide. - We're out of time. We have 19 minutes until every firewall on Earth goes down. Then after that... After that... it's still a Convergence. If we fail, we go back underground, and this time, for good. Now you two stay down when I tell you this time, okay? Do you understand me? Okay. I love you. We're--We're gonna come back for you as soon as everything's clear, okay? Mark. You're brave as hell... both of you. We got this. It's okay. What's that sound? It's malevolent code. It's trying to take them over. - Mark. - Total Convergence achieved. Kill all organics. It's reached Total Convergence. Reena! We can't just leave them in there to die. Well, shooting at it doesn't do anything, other than piss it off. If we can get above it... there's a walkway still intact above the T.C. What are you gonna do with that? The T.C.'s already fused itself with all the tech on Earth. I don't know, Reena! Might be a weapon I can still use! I can still use it! It hasn't been seized by anything yet. No, it hasn't. The T.C. hasn't fused itself with all the tech. It's trying to fuse itself with all the tech. Of course. It's not a digital process. It's a physical process. It doesn't happen instantaneously. Do we know that for sure? It would go against the laws of physics. The T.C.'s been reaching, probing, capturing all over, but--but that takes time. So how do we get up to that walkway? Look, there's a way. All right. Okay. Trevor! Reena! Reena! Reena. Come on. Come on. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. Come on. Come on. - Reena, get down! - Grab her! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! I'll cover you! Come on! Come on! Mark, come on! - Go now! - We need to go! - Mom, Mom, Mom, we gotta go! - Mark! Mark! - Mom, right here. Mom, Mom... - Mom. You have to get down. Shield yourself. We have nothing left to shield ourselves with, except for the Z-Bots, and they're connected to the T.C. Can we shield ourselves inside of the Z-Bots, you and me? They're only connected by a thin set of wires, not like the lions. Even if we get close enough, we have nothing left to hack them with, nothing left to blow them up with. We-- Yeah, we do! We show them with our minds. They scan human neural networks, right? So let's give them something to scan. So, what? What, we bombard them with whatever directive we can think of, and then what? And then what? We--What if-- What if we die? Then we go down swinging. Okay? You really are my sister, huh? I love you two... so much. I am so, so proud of you. Okay. We throw these straight at the Z-Bots. It'll stun 'em, right? It definitely won't destroy 'em, not with the T.C. in control. But yeah. Yeah. I love you. Let's go. Come on, Reena. You ready? Throw 'em at the Z-Bots! Blow a hole in their back! Get down! Get down! Get down! Now's our chance! Let's go! Let's go! Z-Bot, provide voice radio function to adjacent Z-Bot. Z-Bot, provide voice radio function to adjacent Z-Bot. Reena, can you hear me? Reena, can you hear me? Trevor? I can hear you. Find those electrodes, the one on the Z-Bot circuit the colonel showed us. I'm looking. I think I found 'em. Ohh. That's so weird. Reena, what's wrong? What is it? Reena, what?! I-I can feel, like, this... flow of information going through my brain. It's--It's inside of my head. I'm seeing what it sees. Trevor, you have to fight against it. I'm trying. I think I can control it. I'm unable to get through to the others. The whole system's rejecting it. Ohh! It's trying to take over my mind! Me, too. Just keep thinking of the whole army turning against the T.C., okay? I'm gonna try again. It's trying to shock me into unconsciousness. It's no use. Trevor, I can sense them. The rest of the lion-bots are headed our way. They're coming from everywhere. They know what we're doing. I can read the T.C.'s directives. It knows we're in here, Reena. It knows we're hiding inside the-- the Z-Bots. It's trying to kill me. Come on, you son of a bitch! Take me! Take me! Reena, we need to create a feedback loop. We could loop the circuit back in on itself, like Mom's EMPs. We need to touch the Z-Bots' heads together. - What? - Reena, we need to touch the Z-Bots' heads together, like we did when we were kids. Human thought and emotion flowing in a loop. It's a process the T.C. can't possibly understand. Think about Mom, all right? Think about us. The pain is too much. Just breathe. Reena, breathe. Focus on my voice. Think about us when we were kids. Just breathe. Reena, breathe. Focus on my voice. Okay, I'm breathing. I'm thinking about Mom. I'm thinking about when Mom used to play with us in the backyard. I'm thinking about Dad. Think about Dad, Trev. The T.C. can't under-- understand this process. It can't understand this directive. It doesn't understand pain or fear. Or love. I love you, Mom. I love you, Dad. Reena. Reena! Reena! Is it gone? Is it dead? The whole place is gone. There isn't a single connection left to the main server. It just kept cycling our emotions over and over. Until it melted the whole system. Mom. - Reena. - Mom! - Mom! - Mom! Mom! Come here! I got--I got you. I got you. We won. We did it. We won. We destroyed it. Aw, I love you. I am so proud of you. Both! I'm so proud of you. Wait. It's the voice interface. Z-Bot, baseline directive? Baseline: world repair. Function: protect human race. We won. It's over. Where's Mark? Last time I saw him, he was pushing us away to safety. - Mark! - Mark! - Mark! - Mark! There's a rifle! Hey, this is his. This is his! He wouldn't just lay down and die. He'd fight. Mark! Hey, hey, here! He's right here! Careful. He's still alive! Oh, my--Where are the-- Easy. Easy, sweetheart. Easy. Where are they? Where are-- There are no more of them. We got them... all of them. We won. For Mom. For Mark Oros. For you. Come here. Come here.
