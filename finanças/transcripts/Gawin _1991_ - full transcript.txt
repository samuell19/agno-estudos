Félix, are you ready? Come on, get dressed, your father's picking you up in fifteen minutes. - Oh, Grandma! Why do you never come with me? I like it when we're both together. - Someone has to keep the house and take care of it. - There are Asteroid, Gawin, And Goliator. - Do you think I can really count on them? - Well— - Quick! Hurry up. Come on. Listen, Doctor, don't prevaricate. Tell me the truth. How long? - The human body is sometimes more resistant than we think. - Dad! Dad! - Unfortunately, he's not immortal. I've tried everything, Mr. Meyer, believe me. Medicine is powerless. And me too. I'm sorry. - That's all you can tell me. - My role is confined to ensuring his treatment is comfortable for him. I can do no more. Now he needs you. Morally, you can help him. - Do you believe in miracles? - With some diseases, the psyche plays a decisive role. It can sometimes be a factor in healing. - Dad! Dad! - We call this spontaneous remission. - Oh well, call it what you want. Thank you. - Goliator, I'm finally going to unmask your traitorous face. You realize, the treatment worked? It's unbelievable. - I can't believe it. You're going to make fun of me, but this afternoon, while shopping, I came across a black cat. It made me ill. I crossed my fingers and spat on the ground to ward off the spell. Can you imagine that? - Yes I can imagine. Well just imagine that coming back, in the same place—I came across a white cat. Do you know what that means? - No - It's a sign of great joy, wonderful news. Crazy, isn't it? - Yes, it's crazy. - I have to believe in fate. - That stuff worked for once. Yes. Yes it's me. Listen, tell them to put the eagle in the big cage. Yes, tomorrow. No, not before. I don't know, I'll be there tomorrow afternoon. Look, I'm sorry, but I don't have one minute to myself right now. Ciao. This is unreal! - You're too nervous. You should be happy. You didn't lie to me, did you? - Of course not, Mum, I just told you. Everything's as it should be. Not a trace. The doctor was positive. I don't know, it must be the reaction. Finally, I might get to go to the conference in peace. - Dad, Gawin is stuck behind my closet! Quick, he's suffocating! - Your son's calling you. Your son's calling you. - I'm coming. Nicolas? - Yes? I'm still going to take him to Aunt Paulette's. After everything, he needs a rest. - We're coming, Gawin, do you hear me? It's okay, we'll teleport you. Do you have a ruler? - Yes - We're almost there— - We're almost there! - Here, get him from underneath. Goliator, Gawin will make you disappear into the seventh dimension. Don't you want to play? - Later. Go and wash your hands, we're eating. - Is something wrong? Are you angry? - No, come on. Come on. Come on, come on my doggie. You're like me, stars aren't our thing. Message to aliens. In the whole of space. I'm your friend. Answer me. I wouldn't be afraid. I'm not like the others. My name is Félix. Somebody needs you on Earth. In France. Come quickly. Answer me. Even in alpha language. Oh, the evening flight again! - Come on. Enough now, Félix, you have to sleep. You know, your friends up there have to do the same thing. Come on, beddie-byes! She's much better. Much less fungus there. - Yes, it's gone. - The treatment did her good. - A lot of good. Here sweetie, come on, here you are. - You know, those birds have one hell of a memory. You'll see, he'll remember it. - I don't ask that much of him. - You'll get a good rest at Aunt Paulette's, among all the cows and chickens. A nice change for you from the flying saucers. - Grandma, you know we say jetfighters. - Come on, eat something. Eat your mashed potatoes. - I'd rather go with Dad to his conference instead of going to Aunt Paulette's. - No Félix, he'll be too busy. Now I want you to finish your mashed potatoes. Eat. Do you think one day we could go on holiday with Dad? Like we did with Mum? Your father promised to take you to Africa next year, just you wait. Like another planet. He's already promised to take me to Venus. I'd prefer that to Africa. Wait, I'm coming! Maybe I should take you. No, you're right, I'm going alone. You see Mum, I was right. They came. Astéroïde! Did you see that? Astéroïde! Amazing! Astro? Me friend. Félix. You understand? Did you come to see me? Did you get my message? Have you been attacked? Watch out! I'm scared, I thought you were going to leave! Don't worry, I'm here! I'll help you! The engine's broken, is that it? You can't stay here, it's too dangerous. People will catch you! You have to hide! I'll explain it later. Come on, come on! Don't be afraid! The lights! The lights! No one will find you in the garage. Here! This way, if you're cold, all you have to do is get under the blanket. And I brought you cakes too. You can eat them. Eat. You were hungry, weren't you? You know, it's lucky you ran into me right away. Because everyone else would have been afraid of you. They'd have captured you. That's always what happens in films. Here. And I brought you this too. It's a dictionary. So you can understand everything I say. If you don't understand, just ask me, ok? What's your house like? Are you tired, Astro? Are you sad then? Hush, Astéroïde! He's not mean. No. You tell him, it's important that he came here. Make an effort, Astéroïde! In doggie language there aren't any countries. Tell him my name is Félix, and we're on Earth. And all night I look at the stars. Ask him as well how many stars there are in the sky. Enough! I can't hear anything. Go back upstairs! - Félix! - Shit, Grandma! - Félix! - It's my grandmother. She has insomnia. I have to go back to bed quick. Or else she'll look for me everywhere. I'll come back tomorrow morning. Don't move, okay? I'm glad you're here. I 've waited a long time for you, you know. It's true. Don't move, okay? No! Stop! Stop! It's me, Mum. Calm down! Calm down! - You could have killed me! - I didn't have the courage to tell the truth earlier. - Which truth? - About Félix. He's ill. He has leukemia. Acute lymphoblastic leukosis, is what they said. - Leukemia? And you still find the strength to fool around. - But I'm not fooling around, Mum. Félix's only dream was to meet an extraterrestrial. That's the gift I wanted to give him. - Why? He's— He's really— - Yes. - Why didn't you tell me? - Listen, Mum, if I'd told you about that flying saucer you'd have taken me for a madman. - But you are mad. Don't you think he'd rather be treated? that we find a cure—I don't know? Is there a solution? - Listen, Mum, it doesn't hurt to try. He wants to see an alien, to be able to talk to him, to touch him. Today, that's the only thing I can do for him. And how do you talk to him? - In French of course. - Because your Martian speaks French? - Yeah, like in all alien films. - You want me to believe he talks like you and me? - I didn't say that. I had to give him a dictionary. He learned it by heart, just like that. Quickly, leafing through the pages - So you're saying it's the engine that's broken? - Nabil, have you ever seen a flying saucer run out of fuel? - So it's not possible. My dad's never fixed anything like that. Flying saucers are too complicated. - Look, actually, it's not too modern. I think it's an old model. We can always go and see your dad. - You're not bullshitting me, are you? - No! - All right, come on, let's go. Dad! - What—? What's the matter? - Good afternoon Monsieur. It's a survey for school. Do you believe in extraterrestrials? That's all we need. We've got enough foreigners like that here already. Right, Nabil? - Come on. - Well, I've got things to do. And so have you. You'd better get your homework done. Go on. - Shit! Coming. Hi Félix! - You're stupid! Couldn't you keep it to yourself? - We want to see it. - See what? - The extraterrestrial. - You can't, my grandmother's here. She won't let you in. - Liar! - Anyway, there's nothing there. - Yeah, I told you, Félix is a show-off. He's a Parisian, he talks nonsense. - Yeah, he's a show-off! - Show me your Martian. - OK, but you have to pay. - Pay? In your dreams, it's not yours. - Five francs and I'll let you in. - Per person? - Yes, although—for girls, it's free. - Go on Nabil, go ahead. - If there's nothing there you'd better give us back our money. - Don't worry, Goliator looks like a girl beside this one. - Come on! Look through the keyhole. He's shy. - It's not true. - Félix, is he fat? He is skinny? - Does he have four pipis? - Didn't you tell me there was a flying saucer at the bottom of the garden? - Yes, but shut up! Do you hear that kind of noise? - Yes yes. Must be a failed rod. We should check at least. - And is it expensive, Monsieur, to change a failed rod? - It all depends on the brand. - It's an old car. You can't see the brand any more. Listen, kid, it's around 5,000 excluding tax, understand? - Excluding taxes? - Yes yes. - And where, Monsieur, is the failed rod? - Under the engine there. - Good. That should work. Let's try. Failed rod! - Failed rod? - I took it from my dad's car. It took me half an hour to pull it out. But with this, we're going to fix the flying saucer motor. You understand? You can't stay on Earth. If the grown-ups find you, it will end very badly. Don't be sad, you'll be leaving. But I've made a decision. I thought about it all night. - What? - I'm leaving with you. - No! No. Too complicated. - It's a secret between you and me. I've been to billions of hospitals. And I could see that the doctors didn't really know what to do. I'm very very ill. So now you no longer have the right to abandon me. - No. - Because I broke my dad's car for you. And I can tell you that for him, that's really serious. What's your planet's name? - What? Xénon. Ah yes, in the Sirius galaxy. - Come here. Sit beside me. - Félix! My grandmother again. She's nice but she always worries about me. Is yours like that too? - Félix! What are you doing awake? - I was a bit hungry so I went down to the ga— to the kitchen. I would prefer you to eat at mealtimes. Come on, go to bed. I warn you, I leave my door open. I'll hear you if you start running down the hall again. Now go. Félix. You know, I'm not really angry with you but— - I know Grandma, you have insomnia. - What were you thinking of with such a promise? What are you going to do? Take him to Mars maybe? - Why not? - Nicolas, come back down to Earth and tell Félix the flying saucer can't be repaired. By the way, where did you find that machine? - At a fair. Some guy rented it to me along with the suit. - And you want to go to Mars with a carnival toy? You're already lucky he believed in that charade. Nicolas, enough now! I've organized everything to go with him to Aunt Paulette's. - Aunt Paulette and her farmyard. Whereas I'm promising him the Moon, Mum. - The Moon— - Mum! Mum, wait, wait, wait. Do you remember the glacier I used to go skiing on? - No. - Yes you do, I showed you pictures. - What about it? - You said it looked like the Moon. - No, I never said that. - Yes you did! You said it! Listen Mum. We're going to transport Félix and the flying saucer up there. As if it was— - You're completely crazy. Félix will stay here, with me. - Stop. It's a matter of two or three days, then I'll bring him back here. - Nicolas, even if you succeeded, what would be the point? The Mer de Glace won't cure him. And sooner or later you'll have to tell him that Gawin is you. - No no, he'll never know. And I'll offer him his dream until the end. - Félix won't wake up as if by magic on the Mer de Glace. - It's possible! And we're leaving tonight. - Tonight? - Yes. By tomorrow I'd have changed my mind. - Message to aliens throughout the Cosmos. See you soon. Stop, I'm coming. Stop, over. I found Gawin downstairs. - What? - You left him in the living room. Here. Your glass of milk. What did you put in there? - Nothing, just a little pill to help you sleep well, so you'll stop running. - What's the matter? You're not as usual. - Come on, drink up. Sleep. - Good night, Grandma. - Good night. - Nicolas. - I'm here, I'm here. So? - He drank it all. - Good. OK, I'll have a look. Félix. - Gawin, you're crazy! - Quick, quick. - Are you crazy? What are you doing here? - Leave. We must leave. I've been sent a signal. Now. - Now? - Yes. The flying saucer is repaired. The sky is clear. The stars will show us the way. - I'm not ready. I have to pack my suitcase. - Quick, quick. - But I have to warn Grandma. Dad! I can't leave like this. - So I'll go without you. - No wait! Hold on! - Oh dear. - It's my mother. She's beautiful, isn't she? - Yes. - Maybe we'll find her up there in the sky. - Yes, maybe. It's a fake, as you see. One or two more things. - Quick, quick. - It's chocolate. Do you have any up there? - No. No. - Would I be warm enough, do you think, with that? Maybe not, right? Oh yes! What? Hush, Astéroïde! Would you mind if on your planet— I'm the Emperor of Galactic Reunification here— and that my father is— Boss! - Yes. - My father made it. Come on, let's take a picture for Dad and Grandma. That way they'll understand. Attention! Thank you! - I'm going into space with an alien. The proof, look at the picture. We'll be back soon. Big tight hugs. What's up? What's going on? - Good evening, Mr Païs. Sorry to disturb you at this hour, but I have a small problem. I broke down, someone took my engine apart, and so, well, I need you. - Are you mad or what? Do you know what time it is? - Yes, I know, it's very late, but I have a giraffe to treat in a circus, so it's urgent. - Listen, Mr. Meyer, taxis are not for dogs. Okay? So good night! Fine— This time, you've gone too far! What are you looking for? A fight? - Wait, calm down. Give me two minutes to tell you what happened. You know my son, Félix. Right, here's what I thought. I dress up as an alien. I rent a flying saucer. I put Félix in it. And then we head straight to the Mer de Glace. It's his last chance. - But—are you taking the piss or what? You're—Is he ill or what? Calm down there! - No, it's not me, it's my son who's ill. - OK, OK, OK, calm down. Calm down. What do you want from me? I'm not a doctor, I'm a mechanic. You understand? A mechanic! - That's what I want. I'll pay you twice what it's worth. Here's an advance. OK, that's going to be good! We can go! Slowly, very slowly. Here we go. - Oh shit, the Allen keys. Stop! - Are you okay? Great! - Nicolas, you forgot one thing. You know nothing about science fiction. You'll look like a fool up there. Drop everything. I think that would be better. If his mother was here, she'd say the same thing. - I don't understand you. We agreed. - It's not rational. It's going to end badly. Come on, stop your nonsense. We explain everything to Félix then I take him to Aunt Paulette's. Come. - Fine. - It's better this way, trust me. We'll take him back to his room. It's too late. We can't do that to him. I'm just a selfish old woman. Go on, start. - I'll be back in two days. - Here, Mr. Meyer, I prefer children to giraffes. - Thanks. - Off you go. Good evening. - Fill it up please. - Should I fill up the flying saucer, too? - Oh yes, very funny. - Seriously, where are you going with this? - Is Chamonix still a long way? - About an hour. - Still. Excuse me Miss, you're in the men's room. - Oh sorry. - Oh no, it's okay. Shit! Félix! Gawin! Gawin! Félix— - No, I don't want you to! I won't be able to breathe! Félix! Félix! Are you okay? - Ah yes, of course. If you can breathe, so can I. - Yes. - Can we go out? - Yes. Yes, let's go out, yes. Here! Thanks. Isn't it beautiful, all this? - But there's no one here. Where are we? - On Saturn. - But that's not your planet? - No—there's another failed rod. - Again? But that's not possible. Normally, alien ships never break down. Never! - Oh they do! - To be honest, I'm not surprised. I knew perfectly well your flying saucer was useless. So what do we do now? - We wait for help. The engine is out of order. - Can you fix it? - No! Gawin's useless! - It's stupid, we were off to a good start. - Whose fault is it? Félix, come back. Félix! How are you? I thought we were weightless on Saturn. And what about the rings? Where are they? Are you sure we're on Saturn? - Well—yes. - Does your transmitter work with cosmic laser or XT ray? - With laser. - Ah okay. Given the look of your flying saucer, I'd have been surprised if you had something modern. Oh well, we still have to try to manage. Go and move the antenna on the roof! - What for? - Listen, do as I tell you! I'm trying an intergalactic transmission. And that's hard! Message to aliens. We're waiting for you! We're lost. Shame my Dad isn't here. He could have fixed the engine himself. Well—maybe. - Oh no! It's not true! - What? - Danger! - What? - Don't move! - What do they look like? - Wait, I'll show you. Look—like that. - What are their names? - What? Bel-ke-sors. Yes, they're Belkesors. They're very mean, Félix. You mustn 't get out of the flying saucer. Danger! Take out your weapon! What weapon? Don't you have a neutron-dagger or a turbo-axe? - No. You walk around the Universe like that? Without a weapon? - Well, on my planet, we're very peaceful. And you go out— It's unthinkable. You're getting on my nerves. - Hello Mrs Meyer. - Hello Thomas. - Can I see Félix? - No, not yet. - Does he still have the mumps? - The mumps? - The teacher said he was ill. - No no no, it's something else. Sit down. - Because David, Julie's brother, passed them on to almost everyone in the class. But can't I see him? Just five minutes? - Félix is not here. He's gone—far, far away. - Gawin took him? - What I'm about to tell you might sound strange, but— Gawin—is not a real alien. - So what is he? - Urbi et orbi. Come in Xénon! - They're not answering? - What? They're not answering? - No. - There's almost nothing left to eat. There's no more Mars Bar, there's only one Milky Way— and you ate all the chocolate rockets. Do you think we can find trace minerals here? - Very difficult. - I bet there's not even a supermarket! - But there's still some prunes. - Grandma eats them when she's constipated. - No, Félix, please listen. - Have you any soft drinks? - No! - Sodas? But they're universal! What do the Belkésors eat? - The Belkesors are very mean. - That's got nothing to do with it. They must feed? They must eat! - I don't know, they fish—they hunt, they— They're cannibals. And they eat little children. - They eat their children? - No. Other people's. - Then what do their children eat? - Whatever it is, it's not sweets. - No sweets? - No, that makes them fall to pieces. - Wow! Do you think they'll eat me? - No no. If you stay here, quiet, in the flying saucer, no. - Well, it's really ridiculous not having a weapon! - What? Stop! - Music calms me down. - Félix, look. Look at the Earth. - I thought it was blue. Looks like the Moon to me. Are you sure? - Yes. What I mean is that it used to be blue. But today pollution has made it all yellowish. - I think you're right, I read that in Dad's newspaper. - Yes. See how beautiful it is. - Yes. Look. Félix, if you believe in stars, I want to believe in a miracle. Oh, I know I— I never keep my promises. But I swear to you that if you do something, you'll see me— More often. Yes. Gawin, I got it, I got it! Oh, what a pretty fish! - Take it! - Are you cold? - Yeah, I'm cold. Watch out, you'll slip! - No, come on, put on your gloves. Here. - You sound like my father! - What? Gawin! Gawin! - What now? - Look. I found this in the fish's belly. Are there battery-powered fish on Saturn? - Yes, yes. Certainly, yes. - Amazing! - Oh yes, amazing. Come on, Félix, that's enough now. You have to go to sleep. - Isn't it cold! - Yes. OK now. Look at me. Oh dear. Here. Take this. Take it with a little milk. - What is it? - Saturn chlorate. It's good for earthlings. It helps fight space sickness. And there you go. - Was that the last? - Yes. - How can you know what's good for earthlings? - What? You know, I learned a lot of things on Earth. - How? You haven't even been out of the garage. - But—but I read that in your encyclopedia. - Oh yes that's true. - Well yes, it's true. - Do you have children? - Yes. - A son? - Yes. - What's he like? Does he look like me? - Yes. - That's funny, because to me, my father looks like you. At least, just in one thing. - Yes, he has no sense of direction. - But he's still nice, I hope. - Yes, but— He doesn't pay much attention to me. He works too much. I think he loves animals too much. - No no. He does love animals, but you too. - Yes, but there are things I can't tell him. Because he's never here when I want to tell him. - What for example? Well, I don't know how to tell him. But— I'd like him to get married again. Because my mother died when I was little. And since then, Dad's hidden all his girlfriends from me. But I'd prefer him to remarry. I'm a little tired, Gawin. I'm going to sleep. Good night, Gawin. - Good night. Gawin? - What? - When you know how to repair a rhinoceros, you know how to fix a flying saucer, right? - No. Gawin! Gawin! ICE CHAPEL Interior sculpted by the Chamonix Valley Guides What the hell's all this! Shit! What's all this noise? Oh, for God's sake! Jeanne! Jetfighters! Hey! We're here! They're going too fast! Don't touch me! - Are you alone? - Who are you? A friend. - That's a lie! I don't know anyone here but Gawin. - Are you all right? - What do you want from me? - To talk to you. - But where are you from? - There. Up there. Up there! Where are your parents? - What? What is it? - You have a fever. - Gawin! Gawin! Help! - Wait! They're trying to kidnap me! They want to kill me! Gawin, help! We're being attacked! Gawin, why aren't you here? I'm scared. Félix! - Dad? Gawin, I got attacked! - Attacked? - It was lucky I was stronger. - But who attacked you? - A Xerkès. - A Xerkès? - Wait, show me the book. - Which one? This one? - No, the other one. I went on reconnaissance. We're near an orbital station. Or a solar fortress, I don't know. Either way we're not on Saturn. We're on Titan. Right on the transgalactic border. Look. It's him. - Oh yes, I understand. It's him. - Yes. - Doesn't he look fierce! - Yes, very fierce. He had a glass eye. A huge thing that came out of the head. And look, the landscape is almost the same as here. So it's Titan. That's where the Xerkès live. You see? You lied to me! - No. We're not on Saturn! We're around Saturn! And where did the milk come from? - The milk— - You know very well there's no milk on Saturn. - But there is. It's bird's milk. Very rare. Look. Smell. - Anyway, how do you expect me to believe you? No wonder your planet didn't get our messages. The antenna's facing the wrong way. Félix? - Would you mind giving me another space sickness pill? - Of course. Wait. - We still have to get to Xénon. If only you knew how to fix your ship. - Félix! Félix! - My grandmother will be worried. Dad too. Maybe they didn't believe me. - No, Félix. Don't worry about anything. I'm here. Félix— This is too difficult now. I can't stand it any more. You were right. I'm hopeless at this. Thank you for believing in it. Thank you. No! We're wild camping. You? What are you doing here? A little walk? - It was me who saw the child near the solar plant. He needs help. - Oh no, he doesn't need anyone. He's fine. Okay, now be nice, and go away. - We have to take care of him. He's ill. It might be serious. - Wait—may I know who you are? A shepherd, a sheep? - And you? Who are you? - I, my dear sir, am his father. - Oh yes? We need to take care of your child. You know that very well. - I didn't ask your opinion. Go away. - Your son needs me. - My son? - Yes! Enough talk. You know we haven't a minute to lose. If we delay, it'll be too late. - All right, all right. Hold on. Just one condition. Tell him you come from somewhere else. That you're a—an alien. From Titan. Yeah, that's where we're supposed to have landed. I know, it's hard to believe, but I'll explain later. Wait. Lift up your collar. Stoop a little. And put your monocle on your ear— I mean on your eye, it'll be more realistic. - My magnifying glass? - Yes, your magnifying glass. - Why? I can still see very well. - No, I'm just saying, it'll make it more realistic. - Look out! A Xerkès! The Xerkès! - No no no. He's a Xerkès of the Mountain Tribe. They're very nice, very friendly. Come, Xerkès. - Do they know how to fix the flying saucer? - Among other things. - The engine hatch is there. - Hey, gently now. We'll deal with that later, Félix. - Gawin, leave it to me! You'd better go fishing for battery fishes. You know, there— Bring us back a nice three-headed fish instead. - A three-headed fish? Yes go ahead! - No! - Do it or I'll tell— - Hold on Xerkès, I need a word with you. Why are you telling him you can fix the flying saucer? And this three-headed fish story, it's not right, okay? - Yes or no: you want him to take me for a being from elsewhere? - Yes, okay, but come on, don't overdo it. Go over there. Where do you come from? - I live in the area, at the foot of the glacier. - And what do you do? - Not much. It gives me time to play aliens. He's watching us. - Come here! Come here! Right— You watch him while I call his grandmother in the village. You can tell him anything you like about the engine. But no matter what, don't touch it. It's just batteries. All right? - Yeah, all right. - Thank you. - Monsieur Gawin! Come back soon! - Yes! - Breakdown doesn't seem complicated. Except—it's an old ship. - Leave the engine alone! Sorry, excuse me. Allô? - Allô, Mum, it's me, Nicolas. - How's it going? - I can't take it any more, Mum. I'm completely overwhelmed. I don't understand anything he's telling me. I think he despises me. I think he considers me a second-rate alien. On top of that, there's an old man, a sort of shepherd, who's turned up at the saucer. If Félix hadn't taken him for an alien, it'd all be over. Wait, don't hang up. What's the matter? Problem? - No, there's no problem. - What about Félix? It's him I'm concerned about. - I think he has a little fever. - Get him back now. He needs to go back to the hospital. I don't want him to suffer. - I don't want him to suffer either! What do you think? That I don't take care of him? That I leave him alone? Listen Nicolas, this child needs to be taken care of. Let competent people take care of him. You think it's normal that at this moment— he's alone, in a flying saucer, in the middle of the Mer de Glace? Seriously? - First, he's not alone, Xerkès is with him. - Xerkès? - Yes Mum, I just told you about Xerkès. The shepherd. But neither your shepherd nor an alien can take care of the child! He needs a doctor, Nicolas. A doctor, you understand? Allô? - Allô? Allô? Félix? Xerkès! Félix. What's wrong with him? - I put him to sleep. - Sleep? How? - I hypnotized him so that his body was relaxed and in perfect harmony with me. It's important for his future. - What? But what possessed you to bring him here? Are you mad? I just told you to take care of him. - If he'd stayed in your flying saucer, he'd have frozen to death. The batteries are nearly flat. Is that what you want? Why did you bring him here? To breathe fresh air? - I brought him here because nobody can do anything for him any more. Neither you nor me. Nor the hospital. You understand? - Listen. For generations— we've handed down a different form of healing. - Yeah, right— - You may not believe it. But—call it what you want. Witchcraft, magnetism, whatever. Trust me. - Stop Xerkès, we're not in Lourdes here. - So what the hell are you doing fooling about here? Go! - Félix is suffering from an incurable disease. You can't help him, neither can I. I believed in this, though—in this dream. I believed in it. In his— Then in mine too. - The difference—is that this time it's my reality. - Maybe, maybe. But I don't believe in rural witchcraft, nor the marabouts, all that crap. The only thing is— I don't want him to suffer, so I'm going back to take him to the hospital. - He won't survive the journey. Not in this state. - In that case, you need to call a doctor. - No! You'll help me. Because your son has a chance to heal. The stars are positioned favourably. A kind of osmosis. It's rare. Look at the sun through this. - What is this? - A solar eclipse A sign of fate. There's no time to lose. - What are you doing? - Look. He's coming back to life. - Come quick, he's dead. - Well? Do we continue? - Just a little bit of sulphur. For the visual effects. Don't forget— We're aliens. - A shower of stars. - It's working! We have to make him drink. - Wait! What 's that? - Mountain herbs and minerals. I forgot the booze! That's it. - Gently, gently! - It'll make him sweat. Gawin. Gawin. I'm hungry! - How do you feel? Well? The fever has fallen. But you—you never know. - When can I eat? I have some cheese from— From Titan, in the cupboard. - I'd prefer cakes or sweets. - All right. I'll get you some right away. Right away. - Xerkès, are you okay? - Good morning. - Good morning. - I'd like some chocolate, please. - Milk or dark? - Do you have any with hazelnuts? - Hazelnuts— Yes. Here. - Thanks. Is it good? - I think so. How much? - Ten francs. - Could you help me because I can't— - Of course. - Thanks. Bye. - Bye. - Is it true that you heard our messages? - Yes. We were lucky because Gawin's transmitter isn't very modern. - Yes, but— In my solar fortress, I pick up all messages that mention—Titan. - Is this the first time you've healed a child from Earth? - Yes. It's harder than I imagined. - Hello! I have good news. - You got an answer from your planet? - No. But I found chocolate. - Is that your good news? - What? Don't you want it? Hazelnut chocolate? - All you can think of is bringing back chocolate, while Xerkès is completely worn out. He wanted to give me strength, and I took everything he had. - Félix is right. I'm feeling much better. - At least he knows how to do cosmic and useful things. - Why are you telling me that, Félix? Because I'm useless? Yes? Is that it? I'm useless. I'm just a poor underdeveloped alien. A—zero, even! But you've forgotten one thing, Félix. It was me who brought you here. Everything that's happened to you is because of me. - Don't get angry. - After all, what do you know about space? Nothing. It's all fake. Movies. Fake flying saucers. You're just a little earthling, see? - What kind of chocolate is it? Dark or milk? - Why? - Because I'd like some anyway. - Go and get stuffed. Here. - Thanks. - Give me your flying saucer. - Are you taking our ship from us? - I want to show it to the people up there. Otherwise— they'll never believe me when I tell them you manufacture such things. - Eat this. - Strange taste. - I don't understand any of this now. Don't you live here, in the solar fortress? - No. - So we're not on Titan? - Gawin will explain to you later. I have to fix the flying saucer. - Wait! What about us? What'll happen to us, without a ship? - Don't worry. Gawin will take you back to Earth in the flying saucer. And then he'll bring it back to me. - And how will he manage to get home? - I haven't told you yet— but I've decided to go back to Xénon— by teleportation. - By teleportation? - Yes. - But why didn't you mention that before? - Because it's very dangerous. Sometimes it turns boys into girls and girls into boys. It's for the journey. Ok. Until it takes effect, I'm going to fix the flying saucer with Gawin. Don't move. Understood? - Understood. - Xerkès, do you feel better? - Absolutely. The magnesium concentrate in tablet form did me the world of good. - Good. What do we do now? - We do exactly as I said. Let's go. - Seriously, do you really want the flying saucer? - Yes, I'd love it. - It's just a toy. There aren't even any wheels underneath. - To remember. You owe me that. - Okay. It's yours. Even though I find all this hard to believe. Between us— Do you really believe in what you just did? - Even if you don't believe in magic, I think it'll still work. - Xerkès. It's hard to say, but— If Félix needs you— I mean—you see what— - What do you mean? - Yes, after. Later. - But you know where to find me. Are you sure he's not going to wake up? - With that drink, there's nothing to worry about. He'll only wake up in his bed. - My name is Nicolas. - I'm Pierre. Wait for me! - Quick! We're taking off. - I must leave you. - Ciao, Xerkès. - You must be quick. English subtitles by jeremys and Marseille —TNT 2023
