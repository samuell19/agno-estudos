Why are your eyes closed? - They aren't closed. - They are. Does it bother you? A bit. THE MAN AFTER Marcel, open the window. Want to come swimming? There's no one. It's beautiful. What's that bathrobe? I don't know, I found it. It must be Mom's. Like it? It suits you. Come here. Come on. Stop it! Stop! - Coming? - No way, it's freezing! It's really nice out. Come on, it won't last. - I'll just get dressed. - Hurry up! It is freezing. No, it isn't. Are you OK? Is it your thing? It's alright... it's almost over. I couldn't find my trunks. Never mind. Say when. Stop! - Your hands are freezing! - My feet are too. See? My feet. - Where are you? - Right or left? Right. - Middle, top or bottom? - Middle. Read it to me. "Art cannot compete with this profusion of crimson and gold." That's true. Do you remember the beginning when he speaks of farmers and poets? I didn't read it in order. - I didn't read it in order. - It's beautiful. He says farmers have so many acres, but only a poet can have the entire landscape. - It's beautiful, huh? - It is. Haven't you read it? I really don't like making love in my parents' room. I've noticed. It's as if they're here. It's awful. Know what I mean? Could you make love in your parents' room? No way. You insist on us being in here. It's more complicated in my room. There's no bathroom. You sound like an old lady. Not at all. It's just more practical. See? - I don't want to go home. - Me neither. But I have to. We have to leave tomorrow at the latest. We don't have the choice. I barely have time to... - We'll come back. - You say that... Of course we'll come back. - Did you have a good weekend? - Yeah, great. What's that? - Dad's cat. - It's Jimmy. Why's he here? Hello, darling. As Dad's never home, he said the cat's better off here. Oh, did he? I don't agree with him. I've never wanted a cat, and I don't now. Put Jimmy down here. - What is all this? - You'll see. Who'll look after him? Don't worry, we will. I never agreed to this, kids. - Please, Mom. - You could have asked me. Your father should've told me. Mom, look, we've got everything already. He's so soft. He doesn't like cuddles. Great. He isn't into cuddles. Some cat! - Look. - I don't even like cats. What about vacations? Just call Dad and discuss it with him. No, but I can't... Honestly, it's... Catch him! Don't let him run around. I'm calling your father. This really isn't cool. Samuel... - I'll get the cat settled in. - We need flea powder. You always do this. You never give me a choice. It isn't cool, it isn't nice. Jean, it isn't nice. Yeah, right, talk to me seriously! You're really too much! I was waiting for your call. Great, that's fantastic! It's such a beautiful place. That's perfect. We can go over all the details tomorrow afternoon. I'll be at the office around 3, OK? When's your thing at Flore? Thursday. Are you coming? I don't know. I don't have my dates for New York. When will you know? Today, hopefully. It's always so last-minute. I couldn't cope. How long are you staying? Two or three weeks. I'll come home as soon as I've finished editing. I'd have loved you to be there. Maybe I will be. It's a major prize and he's my protégé. Remember we've got to set up the projector. When's your seminar? May 19th. What's it about again? Madness that heals. It's about shamanism. We should invite a few journalists. What's it got to do with my book? It isn't important. Just the loyal ones. I'm sure it'd interest them. They'd be flattered we thought of them. If you say so. You're the boss after all! Did you see that magazine article? The press is even more excited about this 2nd book. I'm the one who's excited. About seeing you. Me too. I'm really pleased. Honestly? I took 3 books. They're in my bag. Remind me? Was your guy at the conference? No. He's in New York. Shame! I'd have liked to meet him. I don't see why. Let's get to work. The babysitter's ill. I have to pick up Samuel. I don't understand why you stay with him. There's nothing to get. He makes you unhappy but you always go back to him. I love him! I can't see you. That's better. How are you, love? Fine. And you? I'm running late. Just 2 minutes. I want to kiss you before you go. - Marcel. - I'm tidying up as I'm listening. Surely you can chat for 2 minutes? Isn't your flight much later? Yes, but I've stuff to do and I've got a lunch date. Who are you having lunch with? - What? - Who's your lunch date with? With Kim. Kim your ex? Yes. When did you last see her? When did you last see her? You're breaking up. I can't hear you. The image is frozen. I can't hear you. What were you saying? When did you last see her? When we split up, 7 years ago. If I hadn't called, you wouldn't have told me. I would. But we spoke yesterday. She called me after. She's got something to tell me. Unbelievable! Something to tell you when you happen to be in New York? That's insane! Hang on... Why would I lie to you? I really have to go, I'm running late. See you tomorrow. See you. Big kiss! - She's pregnant. - Really? Who by? Her guy. Why make that face? I'm not making a face. I was worried you'd feel hurt. Why would I feel hurt? I don't know... We haven't had a child. What's that got to do with her? I was worried you'd be upset. That's weird. You're handsome. To think I've never seen you without your beard. I couldn't bear it if you shaved it off. Must be because I'm into Christ! What are you like underneath? If you only knew! It's as if I only know one half of you. It's the good half. What does that mean? Got something to hide? You're the one with something to hide! Again? - Don't you want to? - Sure. - Can't resist, can you? - Not you, no. Aren't you ever tired? I was already jerking off when I was 12 or 13. Really? A lot? I don't know... 2 or 3 times a day, at least. Do you still do it now? Can we change the subject? Does it bother you? Not at all. - It's just that sometimes I... - Enough! - That's enough. - Hang on! Stay here. Leave it to me. We're having eggs, ham... I had eggs for lunch. I'll do pasta then. What's that? The color graded version of my ad. I'll show you. - What's that? - It's when you enhance the image in post-production. You correct the color and so on. Did you see we have Dad's cat Jimmy? He's here. Look at his eyes. He's like ET. - Suzanne. - Yes? - Come on. - I'm coming. Show us. - Ready? - Yes. Samuel, you're eating candy? Dinner's in 5 minutes. It's great. - It's really good. - I'm changing the end. - But otherwise it's all there? - Yeah, it's all there. It was a nightmare. I have to find a new colorist. That guy's impossible. He's got a massive ego. Every frame... Why do you always want him then? I guess I think it'll work out. It's really beautiful. - It's good? - Yes, very. Will it stay like this? The end needs some work but nothing major. I've another version to show you. - I'll finish the kids' meal. - Just quickly. No, later. We'll be more relaxed. What are you doing? - Try to understand. - I do understand. I'll finish making dinner then we can watch the other version. I come after! Let's go eat. Hi, love. Are you at home? Want to meet for coffee? I'll be there in 2 minutes. Hi, this is Marcel. Leave me a message. Where were you? I was asleep. You were sleeping? Yes, I was. I called your landline 20 times. My mobile's on silent. The landline is... What? ...with the 2 doors closed because I was actually asleep. Didn't you get my message? Yes, but I was beat. I wanted to sleep at home tonight. You could have called and told me. I thought you'd be asleep. Or texted me. I was waiting. Well, in any case... What? In any case, I can't... tonight. I can't hear you. What? In any case, I couldn't tonight. You never can when I ask you. We've had this conversation. I can't hear you. What did you say? I said, it's 3 a.m. and I have to get up early. By the way... I read the interview you did with Marie. I'd like to know what you really meant when she asked what effect your beard has and you replied, "Women love it or hate it." I can't hear you. - I can't fucking hear you. - Nothing special. I can't hear a word. I can't hear you. Hi, this is Marcel. Leave me a message. What's your problem with women who love or hate your beard? It was a generalization. I said women... What do you mean, a generalization? You weren't talking about men or kids, but women. It isn't a generalization. Is that why you invited me? To hassle me about an interview you set up? No, I'd forgotten. But I'm in a real state now. I put you two in touch because she's a friend. And I'm not happy you said that in her magazine. - Suzanne, my meeting... - Everyone will read it. I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck about your meeting! Would you like it if I said in an interview: "Oh yes, men either love or hate my haircut"? - I wouldn't take it badly. - You liar! That's easy to say. I'd never do that to you because I care about you. Yeah, I can see that. I can see how much you care. Right, I'm going to bed now. So goodnight... You're hanging up on me? Yes. Seeing as you don't want to. I've been trying to get hold of you for 3 hours. I'm dead worried. I'm stressed, and you won't talk to me! Look, it's 3 a.m. I can't hear you! I can't hear you! Just talk to me. I can't hear you. I can't hear you. - Please talk to me. - It's 3 a.m. It can wait. It can't wait! If you don't get that and you hang up, we're over! Fine! I'm tired of your threats, so goodnight. You're nasty! I don't understand... I don't understand and... How can you be so mean when you're supposed to love me? Stay with women who love your beard! Get out of my life! Get out of my life! You'll never see me again. "I've decided to go to Japan, as I've longed to do. "I'm on my way to the airport "and I've realized the only person I love and feel good with "lives 100 meters from me. I could turn back." But he didn't! He says he could but he didn't. - He's in Japan? - For 10 days now. I'm going crazy. I tried calling him, the ringtone was weird then it went dead. He hasn't called since you said it was over? No. He never calls. It's always me. You seem well. Because you're here! I'm happy to see you. You're good without him. You're better! - You're more relaxed. - No! I'm falling apart. - I'm more relaxed? - With him, you're all tense. I swear! You're stressed out, all tense, never happy. - A 3-year nightmare! - I really love him, Agathe. I can't live without him. I know it's dumb but... You've had dinner! Go to bed, Anna. - It's late. - Please! I mean it. Off you go. Come give me a hug and go to bed. - Goodnight! - Night, Mom. Sleep tight. OK, I'll try. Goodnight. What do you want? What'd be ideal? Him to come back. - He's going to! - I want him to come get me. You think he'll come back? You hope he doesn't! I don't know. I'm worried I'll freak out tomorrow. You won't, it'll be fine. Come on! You seem well. - Really? - Sure! You look great. 3 years... You had a good 3 years together and now.... You weren't happy with him. It isn't all rosy. His daughter... - Is that any better? - No, not at all. You see? So... She won't answer me, she ignores me. Honestly, if you did a list of the pros and cons... You're right, I should do that! I don't really know... He isn't right for you. You deserve better. I'm attached to him. Physically too. - Yes, but... That's the problem. - Sexually. See? There's no other guy... I'm attracted to. Not one. - He's under my skin. - It's only been 10 days. What I mean is... See? I've got him under my skin. He's the only one. - What are we going to do? - I don't know! - You're having a 3rd kid. - That's right. - You're radiant! - Maybe. - It might just be... - I can feel you are. I had sex once. - Sex once, one kid! - Sex once this month, and bam! Tell me what a real couple is. They're just minor things. What's really important is to have projects together. A child... A house in the country... Now that's a project! It's really vital for me to have somewhere I can settle. We can't afford one. If you think like that, it'll never happen! You have to visualize it. You have to... Desire, you see, there's nothing more powerful. Once you have the desire and you're sure... See? You take the time to... - It'll happen. - Know the Vexin? My grandparents had a place there. It's in the Oise, it's beautiful. It's hilly. You see? - What? - You're visualizing. It's all you have to do. It's crazy. It's even changed your face. - Really? - Sure! You can feel it. Awesome, huh? - Did you get a roller? - I got everything. Did you buy Tollens? The guy suggested a more common, cheaper paint. If he said so... He knows better than me. Hey! I got everything else. - Sorry I didn't buy your Tullens... - Tollens! Tollens, Tullens... You got a bargain there! If it isn't high coverage, we'll have to do a second coat and you'll have to go see your buddy... I reckon you're a winner! What's your problem? You could've gone. Like I have time! My brief is for tomorrow. So I've got nothing better to do than paint your damn box because sky blue clashes with madam's garden! You should have said you couldn't do it today. We've been planning to do it for ages. It could've waited. Excuse me! You bust my balls. He can't wear a suit that only reaches his knees. Yes, Jean, I know how much skiing costs! That's why I don't go anymore. Go with him. He has to try it on. There's a sports store near your place. Look, I really don't have time. All right? OK, I'll take him this weekend. This is the last time. Feel how hard I am? Marcel! Are you listening? What? Are you seeing your sister tomorrow? Not anymore. Why? I thought you were. I figured I'd do some writing. You've not mentioned your novel in ages. It isn't a novel, it's an account. That's because I'm not making any headway. It's fine, you can work on it. I'll watch a movie in the bedroom. It's harder if you're here. I don't see why. Because I'd rather be with you. If you want to be alone, say so. I don't want to be alone! But it's the only way I can write. I can't otherwise. Surely you understand? Sure I do! I've got a script to write myself. - Then do it. - Look, you do your writing, - I'll do my stuff. - I'm not stopping you. Don't worry about me. I'll do my stuff. It isn't a problem. Hi Paul, it's Suzanne. Could you call me back? Big kiss. Not bad, huh? - What a wiggle! - Yes, ma'am, a Tahitian dance just for you! I love it! I've a favor to ask you. - The answer's yes. - Because of my dance? Is that it? It works every time! Tom, my pal from LA, is coming to Paris. He has nowhere to stay, he's totally broke. I'd like to lend him my apartment. Where will you stay? Well, here. - Is it a problem? - Not at all. You'll be able to set up the screen. He's a good-looking guy, your shrink-writer. - He isn't bad. - You kept that secret. Have you known him long? At least 10 years. That's weird... You published him in 2005. Yes, but I've known him longer. Did you two have an affair? Why don't you answer? You slept together! Did you say something? Don't you want to sleep? Your light's bothering me. I'm going to read a bit longer. Switch it off. Can you? In a minute. - Don't you like it? - What? My bun. You don't like it. - Why do you say that? - I know you. Your bun's fine by me. You don't give a damn. Why switch off your phone when you're here? I told you, I don't like phones. I know that, but you've got a daughter and a job. My daughter has a mother. And a father! Know what? What? I like knowing you're just visiting and could leave any time. As long as you tell me to go. - I'm afraid of routine. - I'll tell you if it sets in. Please do, so I've time to make arrangements. To call Paul. Paul or another guy. You're on the early train. Is that a problem? Nothing's a problem. Written it down? Let's go. What? You're so down, we'll get nowhere. Come on. - Where? - I've got an idea. Good. Great. Left, right. It's just a beard. I'm not used to seeing you like this and... it's weird you didn't call me to discuss it first. I have to ask your permission to shave? No, but... It could've been a joint decision. After all, you're with me. We're together. You look younger. Yeah, I know. You're handsome. Thanks! Put yourself in my shoes. That's hard! Did another woman ask you to shave? What are you on about? I'm just checking. You're afraid of routine. You've got a new man! I never asked for a new man. Don't forget your phone. Don't worry, I won't leave a trace. See you tonight? My daughter's staying. I thought after a week you'd want to be alone. Never mind. I'll call you. Better late than never. You're sure about this? There, it won't come off. Don't lose it, OK? Or you can't take it off. I've always wanted one. What's our problem? I don't know. We've been together 5 years. We've already separated. We're always on the verge of splitting up. I don't know what else to do. I suggested couple therapy, but you're not interested. How would that help us build a relationship? It's such a violent process. Great if we want to split up! I went 3 times with Jean. After our separation. It was a real eye-opener. It made me see I'd made the right decision. Really? Why? He described an awful woman to the therapist. It took me a while to realize he was talking about me. I think he'd totally forgotten me. It was just an idea. We wouldn't be going about splitting up. But to get someone to help us talk. My therapist suggested it. We talk all the time. But we don't understand each other. Why should I change my plans if her job's cancelled? I'm not at her beck and call. Yes, I understand, Marcel. What do you mean? He's tired of spending weekends alone with his daughter and wants to live with me but I don't want, or rather I can't live with her apparently or spend time with her. And you understand he refuses? We could be together! - I didn't say I'm tired of... - You did too! That's all we talked about at the last session. That and your ex! - It wasn't the right time. - It never is! - You don't want to sort things out. - Calm down. The fact is, he can't even take me away when we're trying for a baby! Don't worry, it's fine. Do what's best for you. Thanks! But, you know... What? - It isn't a problem. - Thanks! But Marcel would love to come to catch up with his girlfriends. - I'll let you chat to your buddy. - OK. Bye, Tom. Give Nedra a big kiss from me. Will do. Take care. Hey, speaking of girlfriends, Nedra came across the porn collection you left here. - I can't hear you. - She took some convincing it was yours. That's wild! Yeah, I can now. But I can't hear you properly. I'll hang up. I have to go anyway. Yeah, I'll call you back. What was that about porn? Nedra found his porn. He said that to cover himself. Sure! Why would he when she's not even there? I don't know. - Don't lie to me! - I said I didn't know. I'm calling him back. Give me your computer. Stop. Right, Tom... That porn is 20-years-old. Cut the bullshit! You're digging your own grave. You said his accident destroyed his memory. When was it again? 10 years ago? You weren't even living in LA 20 years ago. You know what shocks me? It isn't that you watch porn. Even though it's never interested me. But in all the time we've lived together, you've never mentioned it. Worse still, I think what hurts most is I never suspected. Yeah, that's it. I'm not proud of it. What's this porn, Marcel? Since when have you watched it? Since always, like masturbation? Why do you watch porn? You could show me. We could watch it together. It'd be more fun, huh? I thought I was your only fantasy and you had a fulfilling sex life with me. - That's different. - No, it isn't! Who was the girl? - You're jealous! - I'm not. But it does annoy me. You'd rather I was alone. So who was she? - You still find me attractive. - I always have. We'd make a great couple for sure. You're so wrong. I'm not the right woman for you. I'm here, waiting for you. I mean it. - But I love Marcel. - Really? Everyone loves Marcel! Were you at the misogynist's? He's very nice to me. How surprising! Why not check your messages? Seeing how it went last time... - Are you asleep? - Fuck! Yes. I don't know how you can sleep. I'm trying. I can't do this, Marcel. What do you want? I want you to go. Right now? They want a preface for the German edition. Could you do it by next week? For the roundtable on the 12th, send the confirmation to Lopez. Or I can do it if you like. You're in a bad way, huh? Why do you say that? Have you seen yourself? It's over with Marcel. Oh, shit... Is it for good? Yes. I've had enough. You left him? Yes, but I reckon it's what he was waiting for. He didn't try to stop me. What did you expect him to do? Put up a fight or something. That's a bit much to ask! Every time we split up, I go back for him. Yes, but every time you split up, it's you who leave. He drives me to it. I'm starting to think I might have a problem. Am I too demanding? No. You pick the wrong guys. I already told you. It's the perfect time to start writing. Until you do something creative, you'll be in a bad way. You're talented. You have talent. Stop wasting it by looking after others. - That's sweet. - It isn't sweet, it's true. And Lopez... I don't give a fuck. - I'll put it on stand-by then? - Stand-by. You OK? Fine. - I'm not Marcel, but I'm OK. - Why do you say that? I don't know. You've said so often how great it was with him, it isn't easy for me. Everything's fine. It just feels a bit weird being here together. Let's have a drink. Perfect! To us! Did you cut yourself? No, it's an old cut. I've missed it. Me too. We're good like this. No hassle, no criticism, just sex. Just the best, basically. What did I say wrong? You've taken in Vera's cat? It's fat. It's nice on your bed. Have you had lots of girls since we split up? Not many. What's not many? How many? Three. We'd split up. You kicked me out. Three? Three! It's better than one. How can you say that? You asked me. Would you rather I lied? I'd rather you hadn't done it! Keep it for the others! It's weird you've stayed here. It's more practical. How come? When we split up, an apartment was free on level 5 so, for Clara, it's much better. Your ex lives upstairs? Yes. Does she have the keys? Yes, but she always rings the bell. You're going? I'd rather. She doesn't give a damn. Me neither. But I'd rather go home. Is that all there was between us? Guess so. You're obviously fine without me. Not really. But you've had loads of girls. It's my way of protecting myself. Maybe you had girls too when we were together. I told you I never cheated on you. Can you get it? Lila. I'll call her later. Must be another bitch you've screwed. I can't take anymore. You're sick, you disgust me. You're right, I am sick. But Lila isn't what you think. I'm dependent. I'm getting help. What? I'm getting help. I'm attending a series of meetings. It's called ESD. What does that stand for? Emotional and Sexual Dependency. It's like Alcoholics Anonymous. Lila goes too. I don't get it. I find it hard to handle love. But it's not love, it's dependency. It's like a drug, basically. It fills a void but at the same time... you try to rid yourself of it to be free. Is that why you had so many girls? When you felt that void? I never cheated on you. I used to watch porn... spy on girls in the street when I was in a bad way... But I never took it further. So why go to the meetings? Because I can't take anymore. Because it's exhausting to always fight it. Because it hurts me. - And it hurts others too. - Others? You, my daughter, my mother. You don't have to go to meetings. You can fight this alone. I can't. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why? I was afraid of losing you. It's lying I can't stand. I really have hurt you. I was thoughtless. I'm so sorry. Marcel... do you really love me? Yes. But I can't give you everything you want yet. All I know is, it's you I want to be with. Don't move. Not at all? You'll see, it's even better. What's wrong? I love you. That's good, isn't it? It's scary too. I'm here. All that stuff would bring me down. Not me. There are some cool people. Like Lila? Lila and others. I still don't get what you do there 3 times a week. For your information, if your partner is dependent then you're co-dependent. That's a good one! Want me to come along? No, I'll manage. I'm serious. If it'd help you, I will. When are you going to LA? The 12th. Will you come back after editing? No. I thought I'd hang out with my buddies, spend some time there. You saw them at Tom's wedding. Yeah, but that was a while ago. When will you be back? The 9th. The 9th? That's over 3 weeks! What about your meetings? Don't worry about it. I already am worried. For a year, 5 days a week, I've been alone with the kids, to help you overcome your dependence. As well as your meetings, job and daughter, you have to learn to be on your own. I love you and I'm happy to do it. To give us another chance. But if you're capable of dropping everything, just to see your pals and get your money's worth, I'd say we have a real problem. You'll finally have time to write. Enough, Marcel. Move over! Where are you? At a buddy's of Tom. The hotel's too noisy. Are you there alone? Yes. Who would I invite? I don't know. A fair was cancelled. I'm glad I came. - The weather's mixed. - Is anyone you know there? Probably. But I'm keeping to myself. By the way, I've had an exciting offer. I think I'll probably do it. Take on some writers and set up my own company. It'll be hard work, but I'll be completely free. Is that what you want? It's really interesting. And I think I want to be alone. I'll fill you in when you get back. How's it going over there? It's OK, but I'm getting tired of it. I don't like LA anymore. 12 days was a bit long. Too long. Never again. I'll be home in 3 days. Can you hear me? Are you there? I'll be home in 3 days. Will you be there? Yes, I told you. That's why I'm coming back. - I'm thirsty. - I'd love a cigarette. You're smoking again. Only now and then. I can't quit everything. Could you get my cigarettes? In my jacket. I can't find them. They're in one of the pockets. What's this number? Show me. Just the number of a producer I met. Who uses a pink pen? It was the only pen there was. He has very feminine handwriting. Stop lying to me. I'm not lying. Call him. Let your heart dilate. Just relax. That's it, give it all the room it needs. Your liver is fine. I'm focusing on your heart and lungs, but your liver's fine, so there's less... - Less tension? - Less anger. The liver is anger. It's belief, but also anger. I don't feel angry anymore. How's your love life? I don't know what'll happen, but... One day at a time. I fetched the copies. Marie said you'd be here. That's a lie. I wanted to see how you were. That's sweet. I'm fine. It shows. You're radiant. And you? I'm OK. - Are we still friends? - Of course. The Man After Why are you here? I'm not sure I want to. Come in. Isn't it open? Don't be silly, come in. Why just drop in? I had no choice. You ignored my text! Calm down! Don't speak to me like that here. That's enough! It's over. I told you. We're through. I've decided to protect myself for once. We can't end our 8 years with a phone call. Yes, we can. Can't we talk? There's nothing more to say. I made you feel insecure, but I never cheated on you. Some clairvoyant talks bullshit and you believe her? - I don't need a clairvoyant. - I'd say you do! I've always sensed things, but I didn't trust myself. Your trips, your phone on silent, your so-called old girlfriends... your "I can't lie to you". At least I learned something important: I sense everything. You're the first woman I've ever loved. I'd never have risked that for a one-night-stand. One night...? Keep on lying to yourself. I know. That isn't the problem now. You lied to me so much, I don't trust you anymore. In fact, I never trusted you. Above all, it's the life we've led for all these years, with no commitment. I find it pathetic. Each in a corner, like 2 egoists, watching our movies, reading our own copies of the same books. We hardly ever go on holiday together. That isn't how I want to live. I want to share. Do you understand? I admit that... for a woman, it might not be so easy. For a woman? What does that mean? You know. For everyone, Marcel, it's pathetic. It's pathetic and it's sterile. So let's sit down and talk. I tried talking to you for 8 years, 8 years of discussing it, of talking about it... 8 years of me trying. It was you who said, just a month ago: "A bond is enough." A strong bond. I can understand that isn't enough anymore. No, it isn't, and hasn't been for ages. And I'm sick of being seen as a drug you want to be rid of. - It isn't that. - Yes, it is. You're obviously not cured. I think I am. Good for you. I can't put up with the pain anymore. I love you but I want to be happy. I have to go. I've got an appointment. Long before we met Long before we spoke Long before I saw you naked I already knew I'd end up blaming you Long before we let each other down Long before the two of us were wrecks Long before this taste of déjà vu I already knew It would be the end of us No one will get out alive No one will hold back the night We won't all go to heaven Long before the hemlock hour Long before that ungodly hour Long before we loved You no longer loved me Long before we destroyed each other Long before we sold out Long before I betrayed you I already knew We were done for Long before we clashed Long before we had a past Long before you sought help I already knew We were doomed And no one would get out alive No one would hold back the night And we would not all go to heaven Long before the hemlock hour Long before that ungodly hour Long before we loved You no longer loved me Long before we lost each other Long before we gained nothing Long before the knockout blow I already knew Everything I know Long before we were hanged Long before we were mere regrets Long before everything was a mess I already knew You couldn't care less Subtitles : Eclair Digital Services
