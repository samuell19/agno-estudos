Soul. Dating. When you hear the sound of the gong, you will look deeply into the eyes of your partner and you will know whether they are your soul mate or not. Its working. And another beautiful winters day in Cape Town, chilly low of 6? to start then warming up later to 20?. Our headline News coming up after the commercial break.. # I'd pray we'd be together # # You'd say I'd see the light # # That one day we'll be forever # # For life, for life # Hey mom. How'd it go? Was he tall? It was hard to tell. He either was or he wasn't. What's he do for a living? It doesn't matter mom, he didn't tick any of your boxes, just like John. Who wasn't very financially stable. But he could afford buying me an expensive watch. So why'd Mr Perfect break up with you when you bring up marriage? Hmm? He didn't say its over over mom, he's just to spread too thin at work and he needs some space... So why you dating all these other men? Because mom, its helping take my mind off him while I wait for him to call. Lady, get off your phone! Olive, Olive.. Have some pride! Promise me you won't call him. - So, no John today? - No, just me. - Ciao, ciao! - Have a great day. So I've decided that by this time next year I shall be married and pregnant, hopefully to John. And I'm going to do it through positive thinking because I've been doing it all wrong. The trick is to see what you want already in your life, not in the future. Just like I do with my parking angels. What the hell are they? My parking angels. Whenever I need a parking space I ask them for a spot and I always get one. Its the power of positive thinking. But you park in loading bays and get tickets. Mr Omar, how are we today? Eh? Okay, lets get you comfy, put your head right over here, and lets bib you up. You know your children are very lucky to still have you, I wish my dad was still alive. He was very kind and very funny. It would be good to first meet you... my word. Olive your teeth cleaning paste has been put up for an environmentally innovative award, well done that's great news! Thank you Doctor J. Mr Omar you sleeping again? No, no, no, no. Come on Athena, just a drop. No, I will definitely have thanks. I suppose he always said he didn't believe in marriage. But three years seriously? It can't mean nothing. I mean how can you even think of a future with a man who is one point one metre tall, with his hands in the air! Ouch, that's a little harsh Mrs P. Just give him time hun, maybe he will realise what he's lost. I hope so, because if what we had wasn't it, then I don't know what is. Stop pestering him, let him go. When he does call, make him wait at least a day before calling him back. A week, make the guy sweat a bit! Boys! I'm not asking again. Make an appointment, before they all fall out. Okay. My favourite rascals! Uh-oh. Hi. You can forget about having rascals. Why can't you find a rich man to look after you, its not that difficult. Olive doesn't need taking care of, she's doing fine on her own. Thanks C. Actually I'm up for an award, for naturally white. Well done! - Congrats. - Congrats. You won't have your good looks forever. She doesn't need looks for a sperm donor. Reporting for duty! What's that? I've never heard of a sperm that can show a woman the world and spoil her with beautiful things. Thanks C but, I actually do want the romance of creating a child with a man that I love. I don't like this soup. Trust me, nothing romantic about having children. Okay folks. Welcome to speed dating. You have two minutes per person. At the end of each round, men you'll move to your left. Now don't exchange phone numbers. Only when the evening is over you can log onto our website and exchange details with the person or persons you're interested in. Right, time. Umm, I'm sorry... go ahead. No, no, no, you go please. Okay umm... When I graduated law school, I realised it wasn't for me, so I joined the United Nations. Wow, which area? Environment. So you're saving the planet. Well. Well, that's if there will be one left for our kids Mike... Our, kids... Hello, Stefan from Stellenbosch. - Hi. - Hi. Okay, open up. I'm not doing anything yet C. Oh, nasty... Doctor Jacobs is gonna have to remove it. What? - Yup. - No. Oh no! Uh uh, uh uh, Olive, no! - Uh uh. - Are you serious? Yes, yes, I'm serious. Such a wuss. Fine gas it will have to be. Breathe in, and out, and just relax. So how many kids were you planning on having with the U.N Guy? You are so mean. Talk about a slip of the old tongue. It's a funny word, tongue... You're such a nerd. What is a tongue? Stop it! Wait we're still laughing right? No. No don't respond Olive. I'm gonna hyperventilate! Look at me, look. The positive thing is that you have me all to yourself, ok. Its, its okay. God. I shouldn't have put him on the spot. He obviously needed more time. Well he's cute. That's a bit dramatic, he's not looking. No, I think I really hurt it. Its a classic tear in the calf. Did you feel anything before it happened? No. How old are you? I'm thirty five. Why what does that have to do with anything? Its all downhill from here. Common, can I just get a break here please? Hello John. Olive, hi. Late lunch? Umm, Olive this is Mary... Wow. That was quick mate. What happened to you? Oh, nothing I just tore my calf when I fell off the kitchen counter having sex with C. Right. - Right. - Right. Okay. Sorry Olive, he's such a chop. You're too good for him. Just give it a break mom I'm not in the mood. Some wine miss? No. So, what brought you to South Africa Mrs P? My husband and I left during the coup. That must have been difficult, leaving your whole family behind. Do you go back often. Never. What's the point? None of Olive's grandparents are alive. Except your sister is alive, she doesn't speak to her anymore. Maybe its time you forgave her mom? You don't know what you're talking about. I would if you told me. Leave it Olive. There you go ma'am. And for you ma'am. So, Olive says your husband's family owns a house there. Do you know who lives in it? - Did he have siblings? - No. Oh. So the house must be in your name mom. It was Aleco's family home, not mine. I have no intention of going back there. That is so ridiculous, we could have a house, in Greece. I told you, I'm not interested. Its not worth it, so much red tape in that country its impossible. Then I'll go sort it out. No you won't. You can't keep running away every time you have your heart broken. I'm not running away, I'm going to find my dad's house. I forbid it. You can't forbid me I'm not a child. Olive, listen to me no good will come of it. Look what about Doctor Jacobs? I don't care. I've gotta get away. Your... Athena She's not the same since her father died. Hi Olive. Helen hi, um listen, we're about to take off. Please won't you check in on my mom every now and again. Sure hun. I'm not going to get international roaming I just, don't trust myself not to call. Good idea. Have a good time and a swim for me please. The captains already asked you to turn you phone off. - And put your seat up. - Right. Sir we're about to take off. Excuse me. Do you know where I can find the Papadopolous house? Papadopolous? Wait, wait! Through the door, turn right then all the way to the end of the road. What are you looking for? My late father's house. Who is your father? You wouldn't know him. Try me. Aleco Papadopolous. His house... earthquake. What earthquake? Before I born. Common... Sad no help. Says who. Me. And my mother. Stupid house! Stupid! I hate you John! Hello. Hi, uh, I'm looking for a room, for one. Sorry there's no rooms. Nothing? Umm, do you know where else I could try? Only one hotel. In the entire village? Ok, thanks. Unbelievable. What is happening? Its like Bethlehem, no room at the inn. Not a single room in the entire village. Jet Who told you that? The guy in the hotel. Manoli? He is lying. The hotel, she is empty. Why would he lie? Greeks can be like that... Yea you're one of them. To you I look Greek? Outside sleeping not so bad, I likened it. Yea you would, you're 7 years old. Seven and half... Sorry, seven and a half... What about snakes and bugs? No snakes, no bugs... Only... You'll be fine. Its sold. Yea I know I'm buying it. No, it is sold. Ok so how do I know if its sold or not? You ask me. Right, I get it. Can I have some oil for the lamps please? We've run out. Of course you have. E12. They've gone up. What? Do you want them, or don't you? Forget it. Thank you. What is wrong with these people. I help you. Something to sleep on, you give me money and I buy for you, but you pay me. Commission? 10%. No ways, I'll get it myself. Okay. Wait. 5%. - 10%. - 7% 10%. You drive a hard bargain. My father teach me good. Did he also teach you to speak English? Yes, and YouTube. Right. Jetmir, my friends call me Jet. Olive. You're joking. No I'm not, my parents had a sense of humour. What if you run away with it. Its small village trust me, I won't get very far. Where's my change? My commission. Right. I suppose I should thank you for the ice cream. Jetmir! Wait, wait, wait. Where have you been? I've been looking for you everywhere! You'll be the death of me! Ow mama. Ah, you're back! Bravo. How was it? Was freezing, we stopped over in Canada and Alaska. Pray I get another route next time. Nikos! Thanks Spiro. Okay. Hi. Paw paw paw paw. You have been nibbled. Mhmm. Do you have anything for the itch? Its driving me crazy. Don't worry Spiro, I'll get it. Its e5. No put, put it down. Thanks. Lipon. You're going to be invited to a wonderful dinner party. Fantastic food, the best you ever had. Am I the only one who work in the village? Ah Spiro! What happened to you? You're everywhere except home aren't you? I thought you said no bugs. I said no snakes. Don't you ever brush your teeth? No I hate it. They will fall out one day and you'll be sorry. No I won't. Want to go fishing? I thought there were no fish left in the Mediterranean. You have to know how to look. Want to go? No. Swimming? No. It help your leg. What's it gonna take to get rid of you? Forget it. I know where you take shower. With sweet water. Sweet water? - Gypsie, gypsie! - Gypsie, gypsie! Sure, I mean that would be nice. The more you scratching, the more you itching. Hey I told you to turn around. Its like life, the more you thinking, the worse its being. Thanks for the words of wisdom, Jet. Who's house is this by the way? My friend. Oh, God! Why are you in my house? Where is your mother? Hey! Come back here! Wait, I can't ow. Are you okay Olive? Mmm.. I sorry Olive. I help you. Okay. That was funny. Yea. Where'd this come from? Hi. I think I'm allergic to whatever you gave me yesterday. There is a cockerel announcing bad news. Here, put this on there. And drink the tablets for the bumps. Why are you limping? I tore my calf muscle. Paw paw paw, here, this will help with the cow muscle. No please no. No money. Thank you that's very kind of you. Umm, I'm not sure if you'd know, my father has a house here. Its the one that came down in the earth quake. Do you know who I can speak to about getting the well in the garden fixed? No, it can't be done. Your grandfather block it up after the war. Did you know my grandparents? Because my mother still has a sister here. She left the village a long time ago, there is no one here who can help you. Why you don't go home? Its difficult for you here. What? I won't fix it. What're you doing? What is wrong with you people. Greece does not agree with you. Yea I've noticed. Don't worry, its not you. Its your mother. My mother, why? I can't help you with that. But I can help you with your well. Mm. I'm Nikos. Olive. How do you know I wanna fix it? Small village. I uh, don't have money to pay you. Its okay, I'm happy to help. Hello Nikos. Hello Jet. Ah, thanks. What, none for me today? Sorry Nikos, next time. Okay, next time. Gypsie gypsie! Don't worry about them, its not worth it. Who is Nikos? He work in engine room on big ship and goes everywhere in world. - An engineer? - Mechanic. Oh. Its very good job... Someone died. How do you know? The bells. He says the villagers don't like my mother. Do you know why? No... Can you help me find out? Maybe. E10. E30. E15. E20. E20. Deal. So where are we taking this? For you bath. You think of everything don't you? Hello. Hey. Mamma no tell, she go... I promise, scouts hon our. What happened to your watch? Lets play. Okay. Yea! I thought you said he was the pharmacist? And plumber, and funeral man. Greeks very talented, apparently. What does that make you? Albanian. For me? Take it. Who's from? Dear Miss Papadopolous. Please be advised that no alterations can be made to the house without town planning approval. Who told them? I don't know. Have you been able to find out anything yet. No one's talking. Come on Olive, hurry. Dinner! How'd you get that? Nunya. What's nunya? None of your business. I'm not gonna eat that. Why? Its delicious. Its octopus. My papa says you always try something once. You are very resourceful. Don't give me evil eye. It was a compliment. Same thing. What? Hey. Hey. You're late. I'm starving and I'm ready to try my first Octopus. Sorry... Dinner is served! Bravo! Manoli! Manoli eat, eat! What are you doing? The oil has separated. The village has given you evil eye. I think I've lost my appetite. Me too, my tooth's very sore. Let me have a look. Ah, oh. Okay. Put your head back. This will help with the infection. So this is what you do all day at work? Mhmm. Looking in people's mouths? Yup. And you like it? I used to. Jet you really have to start brushing, otherwise you will lose all your teeth and you'll never find a girl to kiss you. I told you I no care. Am I interrupting a party? No not at all, I was just telling Jet that he will never find a girlfriend if he doesn't brush his teeth. I don't want one! Oh you will one day. Not you too. Okay so this is what they use in some parts of Africa to brush their teeth. - Ah. - Ah. You can pretend you're in Africa. Huh. Is it my turn now? Nothing wrong with your teeth. Your mother is looking for you. Take your toothbrush. Thanks Olive. So what brings you to Greece? Uh, its a long story. I have time. I'm in trouble, again. Where have you been? Your father is turning in his grave! All the trouble you have been giving me! Do you want me to join him? Sorry. How old do you think she is? She must be about thirty-five? Mm, she looks older to me. And not married. Probably came here to steal our men. I can't rest with her here. What are you eating? Eyy, what are you eating? I'm not eating anything, it's a toothbrush. Hey. Spiro! It is always Haroula's fault! No! She did this, she did this to me! She's done nothing to you! You are punishing the wrong person. I don't care, she is Athena's daughter. Where is Athena? If she were here, I'd punish her. But she's not. 35 years Haroula! 35 years you have been holding onto this hatred! She stole... She stole my fianc? and left without saying goodbye! How do you forgive that? You try Haroula, you try. Spiro, you wouldn't understand. He was the love of my life, and she took him! That explains why she never wanted to come back. She's just too proud, will never admit doing anything wrong. Paw paw. She chose to cross the wrong woman. Who died now? No one, its a wedding. Don't worry Olive, you'll learn. Paw paw paw paw. Its poisonous sea coral. There is no poisonous sea coral here. She has evil eye. Don't worry Olive, Spiro help you. Sorry, sorry. It must be done. What's the matter with her now? Huh? Come, its time you and I had coffee. Can we talk about it another time my knee is really killing me. One coffee never killed anyone. I don't believe in fortune telling. Have you ever had your cup read before? No, I... Then how would you know? Huh? Circle the cup with your right hand, three times and then put it upside down. Mm. What does it say? That you are in grave danger. What do you mean? That you are a very thick skinned woman, who doesn't know when she's not welcome just like her mother. No wonder my father left you and by the way he's dead so now both of you can't have him. Does that make you feel happy? Aleco is dead? Get out. You get out of my shop, you get out! Can I have another one please? So is there a taxi to Athens everyday? Don't leave, don't let her win. The entire village hates me and my family. It is not true. You have two fans, possibly three. I see how Spiro looks after you. No I made a huge mistake coming here. But I made an even bigger mistake pushing John away, I should have listened to Helen and C. Why? What did they say? They told me not to contact him, but I did I just missed him so much. Its all just games no truth anymore. Everyone is so scared that they will get hurt... so they pretend they don't care and then the games begin and everyone loses. But I could have won him back. If he could not see who you are, then he was not the right man for you. Can I tell you a secret. I wanna have children, and I wanna get married one day. Because... all the movies end like this? Marriage isn't the only way to be happy Olive. All these old fashioned ideas of what love should look like is making so many people unhappy. You're very wise for such a young man. I had to grow up quickly. My mother was sick since I was a little boy, so I help my father take care of her. I'm sorry Nikos. Don't be. My life is good Olive, I'm very lucky. I'm sorry. Spiro, see you later. Finally, I waiting for you, come on. No, leave me alone. Jet please go away. Okay. I'm sorry. Its me, again. Is she here? - No. - Good. Any chance you can do my teeth for me? I don't have my equipment or anywhere I can work. Its no problem, I arrange everything. Okay, do you have something for sunburn? You must take a hot bath with vinegar immediately, take out the sting. I don't have a bath remember. This is also very good. And something for my head. I'm sorry, about everything. But mostly I'm sorry about your father. Thank you. How is Athena? I'm sure she will find love again. Yea I don't think so she loved my dad very much. I know, Aleco had no choice. The marriage was set when Haroula was born. Don't blame your mother, sometimes you don't choose love, it choose you. Thank you Spiro, means a lot to me. Where you close to my parents? Yes Koukla. But now is not the right time to talk. Haroula will be back soon. Why is she still so angry after so many years? Its complicated Olive. Come, I don't need trouble. Thank you. You are burnt. Need some protection. Its okay, I've got some cream now. I'm so embarrassed I fell asleep on you didn't I? You were tired. Mhm. I woke up this morning and you were gone. I had many things to do. What things? Psshh, things. A wedding? No, its three o'clock. Come on I'll never get it. Spiro, I've been stupid woman. I know. Don't... don't think about what I said the other day. You are the love of my life, there's no one else. I know. So, enough now with Athena. Ah! Told you! How is this possible? You make all the wrong moves, you still beat me. I'm just better than you. No one is better than me. Trois. Olive, Olive. Stop trying to distract me. But you're still gonna lose. - Ah. - Ah. Wow. Dinner for two. Who brought that? Thank you for looking after the shop. What took you so long? Huh? And don't even think about lying to me. Oh, I see. Mm. These are amazing. My bet is on Spiro. Mhm. Haroula would never let him bring you all this. Then who else? Mhm. Woah. Where are those bells coming from? What bells? The little bells ringing somewhere. I'm glad I ring your bells. I'm serious, its like the bells the papas ring in church. So its true. What's true? The villagers say this house is haunted... but I never believed. Many years ago, when the communists moved into our village they caught a priest who was helping the rebels in the mountains and they brought him here, to this house and they tortured him. And when he died they just threw his body down the well. They say you can still hear his bells ringing, and that this house is cursed. That's why it was so badly damaged in the earthquake. Come, we go to my house. How do you like spending your time? I read, a lot. My mother was very sad after I was born, she never got better. So growing up I become interested in how a woman thinks... and you don't let go. Yes I do. No Koukla, in that moment you stop. You're scared. Of what? Not being in control. Okay so, I may have been told that before... I don't know, maybe the uncertainty hurts too much, I hate not knowing. If you cannot let go, you cannot live. You have to surrender everything, even the pain, and this pain here is a reminder that you are alive. Sounds terrifying. So my wise gorgeous man, what are we gonna do today? - Today? - Mhm. I thought we'd spend the day together. Sorry Koukla, I have other things I must do. Oh ok. I thought you were on holiday? So, who was that? Oh some little sheep having fun. So um... I was thinking. Um... maybe I should set up a small practice in the village to earn some money. Yes you could, how long are you staying? I don't know, its not like I have much to rush home to. You mustn't stay for me Olive. Of course not. Good. Is this just a holiday fling for you? It is what it is. You have a fling every summer? Don't make this bad Olive, its doesn't have to be. Not every relationship has to be forever. Sure, okay. I have to go. Hey. I've been wondering where you've been. Thanks for watering the garden for me. So Nikos is your boyfriend now? Not anymore. Stupid house. Going to break like everything in your life. Jet stop. Look I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I haven't been around. How about we go for a swim tomorrow when I get back from Athens? Why you go Athens? I have some business to do. What business? None of your business. If you need money I give back to you. You haven't spent it? I saving it. For what? Camera. But take it back. No you've earned it fair and square. So you selling your watch? No I, I threw it down the well. Why didn't you tell me about the papas ghost? Jet Because maybe he comes back. I don't think he's ever left. I heard his bells the other night. Jet you don't have to be afraid, I'm pretty sure the papas was a good person and he would never hurt you, only protect you. Here, hold it tight close your eyes and make a wish. And throw it down the well. Come, I show you something. My parents told me about this church. Its where I make my wishes. My papa showed me. He said that if you want a thing in life, you must believe and it will come. Just like my parking angels. Maybe, make a wish now. Jet is in love, Jet is in love! Hey! Leave him alone! Go! Ah. Ah. Ah. Costa, the more you think about it the worse it will be, common think about something else. Imagine you are swimming in the sea or picking olives. I promise I won't hurt you. Its my first time. I can see. Hi, is this City Planning? Excuse me. Costa, what are you doing here? Olive? So sorry to interrupt. Excuse me Sir, please can you help me. I have been trying to get divorced from my wife, for 5 years. I don't know where else I can go. All I need is one official stamp to make it legal. I stamp it. Only out of the goodness of my heart. It will cost you e100. No problem. Here. Thank you, thank you! So as I was saying. My father had no siblings, so we believe the house would have been left to him. Jannis The name? Aleco Papadopolous. I also wrote you a letter but I never heard anything back. These things take time. Ah, here is your letter. I will have to run a search and make enquiries. How long will that take? Months, maybe years. Are you kidding me? Would you like me to do it or not? Yes, yes, we might as well get the process started thank you. And I advise you not to be tempted to start building until we establish true ownership. Nikos, what is this? Now the sun won't bother you. Are you still angry with me? No its city planning, this is gonna get me in a lot of trouble. You worry too much. They will never find out. Don't be so sure. Hello Panajoti! Just in time, this is Olive. Olive this is my cousin Panajoti, he has been helping me unblock the well. Hi. - We are nearly finished no? - Yea, nearly nearly. Is this what you've been busy with? Yes, and for this you are angry with me? - I'm so embarrassed, I'm sorry. - Don't worry, I'm happy you are talking to me. You really are quite wonderful. I know. Listen, I'm late. I need to meet Jet for a swim. I'll see you later. Jet! Jet! Hi, I'm Olive. I'm looking for Jet, have you seen him? No, everyone is always looking for him! I'm sorry its just, I was supposed to meet him and I was a bit late, I'm a bit worried. Don't waste your breath, he is impossible, impossible! Jet! Jet! Jet! Nikos! Nikos don't unblock the well! Spiro, please help. Its Jet, he's fallen down the well and Nikos has gone up the mountain to unblock it! Haroula watch the shop! Oh my God. Bravo! What was he thinking? We have an audience to watch the water arrive. Nikos hurry, Jet's fallen down the well! Panajoti put the rocks back quickly! George go help him! What are you waiting for Nikos? Get down there! For Pete's sake! We don't have time for your superstitions! The waters coming faster, hurry! Get the stretcher from the car. One, two, three! Go, go Olive, go! Slowly, slowly. I've got his legs. Okay, come, come, come! Olive come quick! No, go just go! You're not going? I'm going to phone Haroula, you want a coffee? No. My boy. I should have known something was wrong. Its not looking good Haroula, the doctors say he hit his head very hard he might not survive. Look what she's done. If Olive did not find him, who knows what would have happened. If it wasn't for her, he wouldn't have been down that well. I've have had enough of this Haroula! Our niece was the only one brave enough to go down the well, I don't want to hear want more bad thing about her! - But Spiro... - Enough! Please, please be okay Jet. I just can't do hospitals anymore. The last time I was in one I was holding my dad's hand praying for him to open his eyes and he never did. You're not running from the fear of Hospital. You're running from the fear of yourself. I'm sorry I got so heavy with you the other day. Its okay. No, its not. Its what I always do. I meet a man and I so badly want them to be the one I forget to enjoy what's in front of me. You are such a wonderful, beautiful woman Olive. Any man would be very lucky to have you. I love that little boy so much. I know. He loves you. This house is Government property now. Its seems your father didn't like to pay tax like many of his fellow citizens. He thought he was smart so he ran before he could be arrested. This house will be valued, sold and the back taxes paid to the Government. Here is your e200 fine for making alterations. What. I don't have this kind of money. Maybe you should have thought about this before you started messing with Greek history. - Please, I'm sorry. - Its too late for sorry. No! You are a conniving horrible woman with a chip on your shoulder bigger than the Acropolis! How dare... No, you are going to hear me out for a change. Can you not spare anyone just a little joy, just a little happiness? I guess not because your heart is too hard. Don't you get it? They had to leave because otherwise my father would have been arrested for tax evasion. And what do you think it was like for them starting in a new country? What would you know? You've never left this village, happy to bully your kind husband and tell lies to all of your friends while you read their coffee cups. Well are you happy now? Do you really believe my father would have been the answer to all your problems? We make our own happiness Haroula. There's a taxi outside for you to go home. Take a shower, I'll be here when you get back. Thank you. You missed a really exciting day today. This crazy Greek man drove all the way from Athens to shout at me. I think you would have had a good laugh watching me get into trouble. Olive. I'm sorry. For everything. I'm sorry. I am a stubborn woman who doesn't know when to stop. My sister raised a wonderful woman. Yes, I am your aunt. I couldn't tell you, in my heart she was dead. Aleco was supposed to be mine. And one night my big sister and the love of my life just disappeared, not a word, not goodbye... and I could never forgive her. She held on to the secret for 35 years. Maybe ashamed, or it hurt too much. Who knows? But I think Aleco inherited a lot of his father's business problems. But I would never have left the village with him, Athena was always up for an adventure. Its so hard to believe my father ever did anything wrong he was... He was such a wonderful man. Yes Koukla. But our souls don't die. We move on to a better place when we're ready and our time has come. Do you know, that Jetmir means good life, in Albanian. Maybe this was his. Its going to be okay Koukla, it is I promise. Yeah. I will speak to our cousin at city planning about the house. I will sort out this mess I've made, okay. Okay, come, come here. Its okay. Thank you for opening my heart and showing me that love comes in many shapes and sizes, especially little ones. I owe you. You save my life. You saved mine. I lost my toothbrush. Can you make me another? Sure. I'm so happy you're not finished with what you came here to do. Finished what? Olive, you still speaking English? What I'm trying to say is welcome back. Thanks.
