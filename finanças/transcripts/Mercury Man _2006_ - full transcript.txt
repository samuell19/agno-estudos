Hey, brother, why are you saying that? And i'm going to take all your money. You think you could scare me? Hey, what's wrong? I'm your friend. Don't hurt me. I give up. Take the money. Hey, Police, what are you guys doing? Come, quick! It seems you're the only one with bad luck. Hello Hello We're visiting the temple of the Relics but we're lost. Can you show us the way? Take them with you so when you get to the check-point, you won't be suspected. It's a long way, we're going by there, you want to come? Great! Thank you very much. Alright, guys, let's go. What should we do? Tell them not to behave suspiciously. There is a check-point ahead. Stay calm, don't be scared. Hello, sir. What do you have? Vegetables and fruits, we are going to sell them in town. Give us the weapons, don't resist! You can't get away from this. These weapons are not ours and these guys are not ours. Let us go and we won't harm your people. You have no rights to negotiate, let him go and give up or I'll shoot your people. They are not ours. If you want to shoot, shoot! We want the relics, tell us where it is and we won't hurt you. Who are you? We're pilgrims and we want the relics from you. There is no relic here. If there was, we won't give it to you. Nobody tells us no, we'll kill you one by one. Even so, we won't tell you. We're not afraid of you. Sir, please save my child, my child stuck on the fifth floor. I can't get to him. Please save him. Hey, there is a gas tank in that room! Be careful, it can explode! Save my child, please, sir. Let's go. Anyone up there? Answer me! Is there any one else in there? Base, this is A2 fighters, A2 fighters. There is a child on the fifth floor. The fire is too strong, we can't get up there. We need backups, I repeat, we need backups. The situation is too dangerous. Everybody get back to the base. Back to the base! Hey, Charn, the Headquarter wants us to get back to the base, let's go. Buey, you take her out. I'll go get the boy. No, Charn, it's dangerous! I have cleared the entire area, except.... err... Except what? It's Charn! He went up to save the boy on the fifth floor! Isn't there a gas tank up there? Remember this ship well. The boy is safe, sir. Again, Charn, you want to be a hero? Do you understand the term "teamwork"? Hey, Charn, I don't understand you. Why do you take training so seriously. Even though it was just training, but what if there was really a person up there, will you just walk away? But if you always use feelings, what do you think the training is for? Charn, the Chief wants to see you. Thanks, Sergeant. Great power comes with great responsibility. Deputy Pairote told me you disobeyed his order and ruined the training. Yes, sir. This kind of situation was created to train you to know when to back off not to rely your feelings only. What if you get hurt in the explosion? I'm not afraid, sir. Why don't you think carefully before making a move? You want to be a hero? Even Spiderman thinks before he moves. I saw there was a chance I could save the boy. In reality, the situation is evaluated how bad it is. If we tell you to back off, every one has to back off. If you can't put out the fire in your heart, you can't put out fire for others. "Equipment Store Room" "Equipment Store Room" Do you remember one of the world-famous news? Very famous! Do you remember one of the world-famous news? Very famous! Oh, yes, it was about the arrestment of a terrorist leader, usama Ali. He was an international terrorist! That's right. We are moving him from the prison in Ayuddhaya.. To? Temporarily, to Bangkok. This is good enough that they make you take care of the store room. Otherwise, you might have to be a district officer chasing those street vendors! I don't care. I'll come with you when there is any incident. I can drive. Hey, can I borrow the light? What are you doing? Wow, that's cool! What are you guys doing? Kriengkrai! What brings you here? Dude! My name is Grace! Grace! I'm returning the suit. How was the show? It was great! Everyone said it was very stylish. A fashion show with firefighter suits? Grace, can you come with me to pick up my mom at the temple? She won't say a word with you there. Sure! "Monkol Dharmma Satharn Meditation Center" Meditation is the controlling of the mind to remain at the normal state, not to be distracted by anything. Breathe in refers to "Budh", breathe out refers to "Dho" - "Buddho" There she is. Good evening, sir. What is it in the truck? Bonsais to decorate my office. Would you mind? No, that's alright. You can go, sir. "Prisoners Belongings Store Room" Hey, what is it? God damn it! Why couldn't you do it quietly? Oh, shit! Fire! Come, quick! Come out here. Don't run. Stop. Wait. Charn, you know what you have to do, right? Don't try to be a hero, you'll mess this up! Why? I can help you. You don't understand teamwork. Don't cross the line, bud! You said you would be quiet! The situation changed, we had to do this. Where is our stuff? This has become chaos; I can no longer stay here. Give me the money and I'll run away. Here. 300,000 dollars but I don't have time for you to count. Hey, what are you doing? You go find some help; I'll take care of them here. Give me the money! I said, give me the money! Here's your money! Father, where am l? Father, did you seen someone bring me here? Please tell me where I am? Why is my body so hot? The body that is hot caused by the mind that is hot. To cool down your body, you have to cool down your mind. What are you talking about, Father, I don't understand. When there is heat, there must be an origin. To put out the heat, you have to get to the cause of it. The heat in your mind, you have to get to the mind. Fire destroys everything but strengthens iron. Fire changes iron into steel. When you have fire in yourself, use it to benefit others. Father! Who are you? Easy, I'm not going to harm you. Why is it so hot? What happened to me? You have a sacred element mixed in your blood. If your heart beats fast, the heat would increase. You have to stop getting so excited. Mother, help me. I want to go home. Mother! Charn, I didn't know you were upstairs. When did you get back? You haven't taken off your dirty clothes? That's disgusting! Well, yesterday, Buey called looking for you. He told me that late last night, something happened and you disappeared from the scene. I was so worried about you I couldn't sleep all night. I had to put out the fire on the other side, mom, Buey didn't know that. I watched the news and they said there was a snatching of a prisoner as well. There were gun shots. Were you there? They were wicked. The late night news also reported the suicide bomb or something on Kao Sarn Road. More than ten foreigners were killed. They said it was done by the same terrorist group that snatched the prisoner. It's okay, dear. It's okay. I'll clean that up. Who are you and how did you get in here? You met me once. My name is Purima, guardian of the sacred relics from Thibet which has been stolen to Thailand. I'm here to take it back. It's your relics but what does it has to do with me? The relics I'm after is the same as the one spreading in your body. It is called "Sun Amulet" in your country while we call it "Moon Amulet" Can you make it easier to understand? Those who stolen our amulet were the same group who snatch the prisoner from the prison and hurt you. Who are they and what do they want from me? We're not sure yet. We only know that they are terrorists. So what happened to me? I feel something strange in my body. That is because the Sun Amulet which is the hot element has mixed with your blood. When you get scared or excited, your blood will pump and your body, both the inner part and the outer part of your body will turn hot like an iron in the fire. Even your clothes you are wearing will be burnt out. Shit, why me!! What should I do then? Don't be afraid. It was a good thing. You are blessed with a special power from the amulet. If only you could control this power, you could be a super-human. "Amulet in Thailand" Interested in the amulet? Yes. What do you want it for? I just want to know whether it really exists and what do the people that possess the amulet uses it for. Amulet is a sacred element from outside the world that fell into the earth with the meteorites, and has been buried in the core of the earth for million years. It came up on the surface when the core twisted. If it is found in the cold area such as the Himalaya range or Siberia, it would be called "cold amulet" If it is found in the hot area like Africa or Thailand, it would be called "hot amulet" Amulet is actually found all around the world but is called differently according to each believing. The only thing every one believes in common is the amulet is a special element with secret powers. It will select its owner and benefit the owner. In Thailand, it is believed that the owner of it will be enduring. If you posses it, you must use it to help others. "Professor Burapa Phadungthai" Where have you been all day? You know we were so worried about you. Odd told me that he only scolded you a little. Why do you have to get so angry and disappear? Your lucky that he didn't tell the Chief you disappeared on duty, or you might have been suspended. Can you tell the Chief I'm on vacation? Good morning, is there anything the firefighter can help? Is this guy at work today? Well, no. Do you happen to have his address? "When you get scared or excited, your blood will pump and both the inner part and the outer part of your body will turn hot like an iron in the fire. Even the clothes you are wearing will be burnt out" Charn, dinner's ready. I'm coming down, mom. Take your time! Hello, mother. Hello, dear. Is Charn home? He's upstairs. Can I ask you something? Does Charn have a girlfriend? umm, never heard of or seen any, why? Find him one. He's been so strange lately. I don't know what's wrong with him. He looks confused and unsettled. We were just talking about you. Mom, I think you spend too much time with Grace; you have become a gossipmonger like her! I'd better go get some drink for you guys. Is this the super hero outfit you designed? They are beautiful. Where's the amulet? What are you talking about? I just want our stuff back. Don't make me hurt you! Take anything you want. Please don't hurt anyone. Charn, give her what she wants. I don't know what she's talking about! Charn! You stay out of this! Do you have any idea how much my face surgery cost? Let's go. Looking at the scene, I don't think they wanted to rob you, and I don't think your friend has been shot. There's no blood and the bullet is here. Mother, I think it's not safe for you to stay home alone. Come stay with me for a while. I don't understand what happen to me. Those people want the "Sun Amulet" in your body back. We don't know what they would want the Sun Amulet and the Moon Amulet for. The only thing we know is when these two amulets combined; they will make a really severe power we can't imagine. What should I do, then? Normally, in case like this, you should have been dead but you are still alive. This is because you have been chosen by the Sun Amulet to possess the great powers. You have to train yourself to control this powers and the most important thing in controlling the power is the meditation. During the training of this power controlling, the heat in your body may burn your clothes. I'm not really a good guy, why was I chosen? To be good or bad, it's your choice, but you are the one. "Equipment Store Room" "Equipment Store Room" Seven helmets, Sir. Seven helmets, Sir. Seven helmets, what about the suits? Sergeant! Oh! Someone sent you this. "Grace, please make a super hero suit you designed out of this cloth. The Super Nine's is okay. I'll wear it to a police fancy party - Charn" Whats this? The Americans are checking everyone. No Don't. To control the power of the amulet, you have to start with controlling the state of your mind by entering the meditation. The amulet is the king of all metal.

Your blood has mixed with the amulet, you body will be as strong as steel. No type of arm can irritate your skin. Are you okay? Your hands are so hot. You still can't control your power? Hello. Mom, it's me, Charn. Charn, is that really you? Don't worry about me, mom. I am fine. Why can't you just give me a call sometime? Do you know how much I worry about you? I'll come back in a few days and tell you all about this. I don't want to stay here in a condo. I want to go home. Oh! Charn! Help me! Mom! Mom, what's happening? Charn, take it easy! Take it easy? I have no idea what they are doing with my mom. You want me to take it easy? How's your wrist? It's alright, a lot better. I'm sorry, I couldn't control my mind. I understand.

Buy them food, maybe!! Catch us if you can! Good morning. Good morning. Welcome back to the World News. This morning, we were reported of ..a news that has been on the front page of every newspaper. It surprises us all. "Hit the car with his knees, he helped the police arresting the thieves" Matichon also has one, "Police were shocked, Terminator 2005, stopping the thieves with his knees" He jumped off from the top of Rama 8th Bridge. He's not Jacky Chan!? The threat that the Americans are very afraid of at present is nothing else but the suicide bombing. Mr. Gerald Farrell, former FBl agent, said that the operation of the suicide bombers rarely fail as these bombers would never keep the bomb away from them. They will stay with the bomb until it explode and smash them into pieces. Come on. Let's have some fun! Let's sing a song! Alright, let's sing this song. Hey, are you alright? Hey, kid, where are you going? Come back here! Kid! Where are you going? Patrol, there is an elephant on a rampage right now! Last night, something happened.. Something very exciting happened. An elephant was in a rut and came out on a rampage The guy in black suit appears in the scene again. He was different this time. Yes, with his bare hands, he pulled a very huge bus made if metal to his hands... To form a quadrilateral to stop the elephant. "Hero in black suit appears again" "Drink don't drive" "Elephant powers hit the car and save a boy on intersection" "Man in black suit appears again to terrify rapist" "Again, man in black suit stops a student fight" Why haven't they contacted us? Or, should we go and save your mom? But we don't know where she is. I do! This charm, actually, is the stone that follows the relics. It can tell us where the relics are located. This stone helps me find you, so, if the Moon Amulet is with them, we can track where they are. Why didn't you tell me this? It was broken the day I went to save you at home but it's working good now. Then, let's go. You go get Grace, I'll go find my mom! Okay. They have moved and taken your mom with them, Charn. They were about to let me go to tell you to trade your mom with the amulet. Where do they want me to take the amulet? Sattahip Peer, this coming Saturday. If they have all moved, they should have brought the Moon Amulet with them, why the compass still tells that it is around here? There is a piece of Moon Amulet here. Why would they want these two amulets? "Welcome to National Childrens Day" Did you bring the amulet with you? Are you alone? Get on the boat. So, how are we going to help Charn? We have to use a boat. I know where they are. And I know where to get a boat. Here comes the next question. I have the same prize for the one who answers the next question, a book, a ruler and an eraser, alright? What is this mask for? Hey, Buey! "Marine Water Research Station" Thank you very much, officer. Can you please tell me what you are doing? Do you have any idea that behind the country that called themselves the world police, what they have done? You see that ship? From the outside of it, it looks like a regular cargo ship but in reality, it is full with chemical weapons. They tried to stop other countries from inventing this kind of weapon but these Yankees collect them. These weapons are being delivered to the Middle East to be used to kill us. They can't defeat us with their military powers. Today, God has an order for us to stop them. How are you going to stop them? With the great powers of the Sun and Moon Amulet that could be as severe as the Nuclear Bomb, that ship will be destroyed in a second! So, why don't you do this some where else not in Thailand? Everyone knows that entering and exiting Thailand is very easy, it's our heaven, nobody watches us. You know that today is the children's day. If the explosion is that severe, what do you think would happen to these kids around here? In every mission, someone has to sacrifice. Lots of our innocent children were killed in the American's army mission. I'm sorry it's their turn this time. Can you analyze the good and the bad? For God's sake, we'll have to do this. You always mention your God, have you ever asked him if he is really happy with what you are doing. I don't think your God would be on the bad side. Oh man, I don't know what will happen if the Chief finds out. I might get fired! Come on. This is to help Charn! We meet again, Mr. Officer, how are you? Where is my mother? Take it easy. Charn! Mom, don't be afraid. Everything's going to be alright. Where is my amulet? We'll find out whether this is the real one. If it'ss bullet proof, it's the real one. If not, you know what will happen. Wait, that's the fake one! What do you mean the fake one? The amulet you want is in my body. Charn! Think about the ship I showed you. You'll go home soon. You, son of the bitch! I knew it! How can you be so wicked! You'll end up in hell and never be born again. You'll die of a violent disease or accident, you bastard! "The movement of the body controlled by the mind, when the mind is in control, the body will also be in control" Mom, it's me! Are you alright? You stay here and hide, I'll be right back. Take care, Charn! Yes, mom. Who the hell are you? A firefighter! I'll castrate you in 5 minutes. Sorry, my doctor has already done that for me. Don't even try. You can't fight the electricity! This is the antiaircraft gun with approximately 3 kilometers range which is quite far. But the accuracy would depend on the skill of the shooter. Me, I would hit the target for 1 00%o sure. I'll explain this. What you see hear is the Radar that helps detect any disguised item coming into Thai watercourse, a missile for example will appear on this screen... you understand? I don't understand! You don't understand. When the enemy moves, both of us will aim and shoot. Have you ever used it? Well, nowadays, they don't fight anymore so, l'd never really used this to fight, only to practice. What if there is war, do you think you would hit the target? If I could hit the target, you have to bet! What is this called? It's a telephone. What does this blinking mean? Well, yeah, what does it mean? Let me calculate this first. Commander, there is something. I'm not sure what it is. From the speed, it might be missile and it's coming this way. It might be targeted at the u.S ship! Can we stop it? The easiest way is to stop it is with the antiaircraft gun from our base which will take approximately 1 0 minutes. How long before the missile will hit the ship? About 3 minutes! There's no time! use anything we have here to stop it now! When the enemy comes closer, we would turn the gun to them and shoot! Can you show us, please? Well, I want to but it's the training bullet not the real one, so.. I have an order from the Commander! ... errr...what? Okay, load the gun! Ready? Ready! Shoot! Can you go check why the u.S. ship is under attack? Yes, sir! Charn! Charn, help me! Don't think that we'll give up because of the failure of our missile! We still have Plan B! Our suicide bombers have spread throughout Bangkok. They only wait for my order. Business that belongs to the Americans both in Bangkok and here will be destroyed within seconds. We value death while the Americans value living and that's our advantage. You may think we are cruel like the wild animals that we kill people no matter who they are! We only want to say that we have been living with others peacefully but war has hurt us. War that made by those countries with great powers. They incited us and made us kill each other. Who do you think have been supplying the bullets to the Serbs, provoked the war in Afghanistan. They made us kill our own people, separated us with the territory lines they drew, set our destiny with blood and tears of our offspring. We can't take peace that full with pain and suffering. I want them to the taste this pain and to know that from now own we will set our own destiny. God bless you all. We lost? Why is God not on our side this time? Our duty in this sacred war has come to an end! Even though we are defeated but our idealistic would never be defeated. Even though I have to die, there will be another usama to replace me and continue my task. If those countries with powers don't stop, we will not stop either! Take them outside! Ok. "Fire destroys everything but fire strengthens the iron. You have fire in your body, use it to benefit the others." Excuse me, Commander; the Navy has finished clearing the surrounding area, sir! We found that this research Station has altered to be a secret headquarters and the missile has been launched from this island. Has anyone in the news intelligence bureau heard of this? Charn, your mom is here. Charn, where have you been? I was so worried about you! I was unconscious, mom! The navy just brought me out. Well, where is the guy in black suit? He saved my life. How is the kid? The Cambodian Embassy has arranged to send him home. There should have been no problem. I'll have to go home too as everyone is expecting the relics from me. Will we meet again? Of course, if you still want to meet me. How am I supposed to know where you are? This stone will tell you where I am. Keep it. Your hands are so hot! Are you okay? I must be a little nervous. Hey, this is my territory. Go sell your stuff somewhere else! "Donation Box" When we die, we won't be able to take anything with us. It will all be rotten into soils. The only thing that follows us is the goodness. If we are good, even though we are not good looking, we will be respected. If we are good, we don't have to be proof against weapons, we would never get hurt by anybody. Any invulnerability cannot be compared to the goodness.
