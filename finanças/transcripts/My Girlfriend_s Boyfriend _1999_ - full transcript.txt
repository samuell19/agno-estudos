Make sure you compliment the house. Libby. Hi. Cory, this is Jake, my boyfriend. Hi, nice to meet you, Jake. Hi, uh... congratulations. Thanks. Come on in. I didn't know you were bringing anyone. -Neither did I. Great house, really. Oh, right, like it's work. I'm telling you, it's a lot more work than you think. OK, fine. You're lying in bed with this beautiful woman, right? But the camera's like a foot away. The lights are beating down on you. The director's telling you where to put your hands, your face, your lips... Your? No, not that. Come on. What? You guys shouldn't be having so much fun without us. We're not. Cliff was just sharing the hardships of life on the set of "Primrose Plaza." I'm not saying that it's a hard life, I'm just saying. Ah, shut up and drink. Hey, wait until after the toast. To my best friend in the whole world, and to her new best friend for the rest of her life. Now you may kiss the bride. And you may kiss me. Yeah. Couldn't wait for the good stuff. Tasted worse. This, um, ill-mannered rogue is unfortunately the best man that I could find to be my best man. A very tight labor market. - Wes, this is Libby, and,... - Liberty. Oh, sorry, Liberty and Jake. Hi. I'm sorry we didn't wait, but we didn't know where you went. I told you, I went to the liquor store. I would have been back a lot sooner if I got my directions my Cory. This guy doesn't know which way he's going. Can you push it in just a... just a little more? It's not going to fit. Yes, it will. Damn these shoes. I told her to get me a size 13 wide. She decides 12 and 1/2 normal. The style's better. Well, it is. Oh. Where'd you rent your tux? I don't rent. I bought it. It should come in handy. I attend a lot of benefits. In fact, that's how I first met Cliff. Really? How long ago was that? Must be about six years now. Yeah, it was right before he got his first series. And you've been close all this time? Very close. Then were you surprised? It's the Wednesday before maybe the biggest weekend of my whole career. I have got this huge meeting on Monday, which I should be preparing for. Liberty calls me into her office and says... You work with Liberty? Yeah. We work at a sporting goods manufacturer in the design department. We're sort of co... you know, I mean she tends to facilitate my work in a way that... She's your boss? Right. So I... I really can't tell her that I'm meeting with another company, even though I already did present my designs to her and she ignored them. You're... you're very good at that. Yes, I am. Allow me. I mean, we've only been dating for a couple weeks, if you can even call it that. You know, I was always interested in her, but she never seemed to care. And then suddenly, we go out once. Then, we go out again. Then we even... yeah, you know? But I didn't think it was serious. And then she says her best friend in the whole world... Everything with Liberty is in the whole... In the whole world... Is getting married and she wants we to come all this way to the wedding. - Does she really need me to be here? - Does she? - No. She's the most independent woman I have ever met. She's got a great job. She's gorgeous, athletic, runs marathons, teaches karate. Ow, damn shoe. Hold still. She just decided she had to bring a boyfriend. She does do a lot of deciding for you. I noticed that. Hold still. I just about got this. Libby, hi. We tripped. Wes was helping me with my cummerbund. It's these darn 12 and 1/2s. I told you I wasn't normal. U, so I see. Oh, no, no, no. We weren't... Of course not. It's Jeff. I cannot believe you gave him this number. For emergencies. Yeah, right. Well, don't talk long. The tuxedo shop closes in an hour in case we need to make any alterations. I'll be back. Jeff, is there a problem? Canceled? Damn. How am I ever going to... Philip Bright himself. Tonight? But... I'm at a wedding. Can't you do something? A train. All right. All right. I'll try to think of something. Thanks... Bye. They canceled Monday's meeting and set one up for tonight. They can't move a meeting like that and expect you to... Philip Bright can. That's the amazing part. My meeting on Monday was with some underling. Tonight, I can meet with Philip Bright. You know, the head up Bright Athletic Shoes, step out of the darkness into a pair of Brights? He's big, believe me. My friend is friends with his personal assistant. Bright is headed to Asia for this month-long business trip, but she knew that he would have a layover for a couple of hours. He's agreed to meet with me personally if I can stop by the airport tonight. And at that meeting, you'll, uh... Present my idea for a tongueless sneaker. You slip it on almost like a slipper. And then one little zip across the side, you're set. How astonishing. Yeah, it's a revolutionary breakthrough in sneaker infrastructure. But if Bright doesn't see it for a month. I mean, you know the sneaker business. Hm. There's a train at 5:00 that would get me back in time. For Liberty to kill you. And she looks like she could do it, too. Yeah, she'd probably make it look like an accident. Yeah, if I leave before the wedding, she'll never forgive me. We'd be finished. Of course, if I told her the reason, then... Then I'd be fired as well. Screwed both ways. But still, I can't miss this opportunity with Bright. This is my whole career. But I would hate to lose her. She's gorgeous. Sex is great. She's smart, successful. Intimidating? Completely, yeah. Who am I kidding? A woman like that is bound to dump me soon anyway. I've got to focus on my career. So you dump the girl? The maid of honor, hours before her best friend's wedding? That would be about the lowest, most despicable thing I could do, wouldn't it? And if things don't work out well with Bright, she could make my life a living hell at the office. Let's face it, there is no way I can break up with her now. Unless you had a good reason. So you think I should do it then? Well, you'd need a good reason. A really good reason. Something that wouldn't hurt her. Something that she wouldn't take personally. We wouldn't want her to persecute you at the office. No, it has to be something like... that you're gay. Right. Like she'd believe that. Well, you saw the look on her face before. Well. That's because it looked like we were... Believe me, the line has always gotten me out of trouble with woman. Of course, I am gay. You are? Oh, you didn't know? Oh, don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with it. It's your business. It could be yours, too. You want to... with me? Just for appearance sake. Liberty sees you with me in a certain position, you're on your train by 5:00. No hurt feelings. You're out of here, clean escape. So to get out I've got to... Come out. I don't know. I don't think I could... no. Gay? Me? And then there's the problem with... if she... And with the whole... no, I can't. Thanks for the thought. I'm sorry you had to find out this way. You are gay? You bastard. Or bitch... whatever. How could you do this to me? At a wedding. No, it's not that you're not... Well, at least this explains the sex. I'm not pressuring you, Cory. I just that, you know, I was married to the man for nearly 20 years and I'd simply like to know if he plans on spending the night her after the wedding. Mom, he's not coming. The jerk. I mean, he was never the most considerate father, but usually when it came to you, he would... Because I didn't invite him. He probably has some surgery scheduled that he can't cancel anyway. I told you, mom, this is a tiny wedding. We don't want to attract the press. You know, Cliff's on those tabloids enough already. We just want our very closest friends and family. Well, I guess that would eliminate your father. But I still don't see why you won't let me do just a little more for you. Hm? OK, we didn't invite a lot of people. We didn't have it catered. But we still might have time to find a band, huh? What do you say? Huh? Oh, Mom. Oh, honey. Don't you understand? It's just, you're my only child and I want to do everything I can to make this day as special for you as I can. Oh, Liberty. Oh, honey, you look wonderful. Oh. But then, you always do. Thank you, Mrs. Lindross. So do you. Oh, I think it's time you call me Rita. I mean, you're not a teenager anymore. How's your mom? She's good. She sends her love. - Oh, tell her I'll call her next week, OK? - OK. - Could you put these over there for me? - Sure. Oh! Liberty, that's for the wedding. I'm sorry. I'll clean it up. Oh. That's all right, we have more. You didn't have to yell at her. I'm sorry. We'll just... we'll just clean it up. We'll clean up. It's not the vase. It's Jake. Uh, Jake? The boyfriend. I just saw him kissing Wes. Oh, Wes, his boyfriend? Well, honey, um... I know it's a little unsettling when you see that for the first time, but men today have a right to... No, he's Libby's boyfriend. Was. Oh. That a boy, Jake. Don't want to leave a mess. You think she's ready to listen to an apology? You don't apologize for being a homosexual. You do when you were dating the girl. What are you doing? Helping you pack. You want to get out of here as quickly and as quietly as you can. And Libby? You've done enough for her weekend. Give her a call next week. Trust me. Hey, Jake. Oh, hey, Cliff. I was just... ow. What'd I do to Cliff? It's not what you did to Cliff. It's what you did to Liberty. She got really upset and told Cory, which got Cory upset. When Cliff asked why they were upset, they told him and he went ballistic. Where is he? They took him outside to try to calm him down. You know, he just met Liberty. Who'd think he'd be so protective? He's such a sweetie. Sweetie. But I guess when something upsets your bride the day of her wedding, it... I didn't mean to cause anybody any trouble. Then, why did you lead Liberty on like that? I wasn't leading her on. I mean, it wasn't an intentional deception. It more kind of... oh. You're under a lot of pressure, aren't you? Yeah. Well, sometimes under pressure things can be very confusing. Liberty is a wonderful girl, but sometimes she can become a bit forceful. That's one way of putting it. Well, that can make things difficult and unclear. You know, a man really shouldn't go off exploring new waters until he's completely sure he hasn't explored all the waters on his own shore. Now, women, we're a very complicated group of people. And I would hate to see you reject Liberty just because you didn't understand everything a woman do. You know? I... I think I'm recovered. Thanks. Oh, you're... your lip or... Maybe I should still put the ice on it. I can hold it myself. No, that's what women are for. No, really. It would be better if I just... Oh my god, I am so sorry. Let me get... maybe you should. I shouldn't be in there. I'm gay, but I shouldn't be touching that... your... It's OK. It's... huh? It's OK. Are you satisfied? You break up with me, you ruin my best friend's wedding, and now you got Cliff ready to tear his best friend apart. Mom, you've got to do something. He may kill him. Calm down, Cory. Cliff's not going to kill his best friend. No, I've never seem him like this before. I think maybe he never knew Wes was gay. Yeah, that can be shocking when you think you know someone. I never meant to... - Save it. - OK. If you want to be helpful, why don't you go upstairs and make sure nobody gets hurt. At least that's what a real man would do. Ah, Jacob. Threesome? I thought you locked the door? You don't see a thing. I think he sees just fine. Yeah, but he's not going to tell anybody, right? Why shouldn't he tell anyone? I told you, I'll take care of it. Well, you better. I'm running out of ways to make you insanely jealous. Jake, what's going on? Are they all right? Yeah. You know, they're working it out. Oh, thank god. They wouldn't want you see. You don't want to go in there. You know what? He's right. Let's just let them work it out. Hon, you haven't even shown me your dress yet. Don't worry about it. Jake will keep an eye on them. Still feeling left out, Jacob? The girls want me to keep watch on you, make sure you don't hurt each other. So Cory doesn't suspect anything? Not yet. But if you keep this up... Perhaps you could lock the door? It doesn't matter what she suspects. You're going to tell her about us and call off this ridiculous wedding. Wes, you know the situation that I'm in. I don't believe this. I've tried to make myself clear. You're the one that I love, but if I'm going to have a career. I mean, come on, Wes. - You heard the rumors. - Yes. And if you want to continue to be the hunk of "Primose Plaza," the world has to think you're straight. Exactly. Screw exactly. Look, everything's going to work out fine. Cory knows I've got a busy career with a lot of obligations. She's going to give me space. There will be plenty of time for us. I'm not a hobby. I'm not promising to be there waiting for you every... oh. Every time that you have a spare moment. I really don't need to see this. Of course, if you, uh... Continue in this... mm... course. Ah... Cliff, is everything OK? Cliff. Oh my god. Jake, you couldn't have waited till after the wedding? Where's Cliff? Cliff? He's... Cory, you should know that Cliff is... I'll bite it off, I swear it. That Cliff is in the bathroom. You get out of there. I want to see your face when I tear it to shreds. Libby, you don't mean that. Yes, I do. I bring him all the way here and he... Oh, you coward. Open the damn door. She's a mad woman. You got to hide me. Why? She's out to kill me, not you. Oh. That's right. Never mind. Open this door, Jake. I'll break it down. You know I can. What am I supposed to do? I don't know. That's what you get for involving yourself with a woman. They're very emotional. Open the damn door! No kidding. You should try switching to men. You'd do really well. You look gay enough. I do not look gay! I... My patience has ended. The door's opening now, Jake. By your hand or my foot. Your call. Bad call. Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you with all the water running in there. Cory, uh, what's all the commotion? Jake. Running won't save you, Jake. Do I look gay? No. Just tall. Would you care for any assistance? Yeah, that would be a good idea. Thanks. You're welcome. That's a nice camera. Take any interesting shots? No, not really. All I wanted was front page on our little town weekly. I mean, I didn't know Cliff Barker was gay. Frannie just said that she head from the Crandles that they saw him walk into the Lindrosses. What am I supposed to just knock on the door and ask for a picture? I don't know. I spend most of my time shooting two year olds that have fingers up their noses. Not that I don't like kids, but it can be a little tedious, you know? So I figure I can break into journalism with a nice, little candid of Cliff Barker. Maybe in his underwear. I didn't know he was gay. So now here I am with this roll of film that the tabloids would pay a fortune for and could probably give me a start in a whole new career. Am I supposed to just sit on it? I don't know. I mean, it's not like I'm in the business of outing people. But don't I have the right to a career? My name is Jake. Melissa, but call me Mel. Jake, you're alive. Yeah. Well, she never really caught up with me yet. Is she around? Jake Waverly. Libby, I am so sorry. It's like it wasn't me up there. Please forgive me. It won't happen again. That's correct. Uh, hi, I'm Melissa Stevens, but you can call me Mel. I'm the wedding photographer. She was having a little trouble finding... finding the house. So I... well, I headed her down here. I'm just trying to help. I really do want to make up for any trouble I caused. That is so sweet. See? He's sorry, Libby. Very. One thing though, we never hired a wedding photographer. I mean, Cliff didn't want any pictures by a stranger that might end up in a... Cliff is the one who hired her. Didn't he tell you? Now. No, Cliff never mentioned it. What didn't I mention? That you hired a photographer. I never hired a photographer. I guess you must have been looking for a man. Always. But when you hired Mel Stevens, that's me. We should have spoken sooner on the phone or something. But, um, anyways, it's a pleasure to be working for you, Mr. Barker. I don't think you realize that... Cliff, this is the photographer you hired. Believe me, you want her to be your photographer. Uh, you know, babe? I never discussed the exact terms with Mel. And, uh, I didn't want to bore you with all the, um... hey, have you shown Libby your dress? Yeah. Well, she started to, but then... Oh, well you really got to see it. I mean, it is just gorgeous. Yeah. OK, let's let them handle the photographer. Bye. Can't miss this. All right, what is the game, Jake? Listen, I could have been on a train and out of here. I'm doing you guys a favor. Makes us even. Nobody asked you to... All right, can we stick with the matter at hand, please? What is with Miss Shutterbug? It's Mel Stevens. And it would be an honor to photograph your wedding, Mr. Barker. Where would these photos end up? It's not a matter of where those photos end up as much as it is a matter of where these photos end up. See, Mel here is not only an attractive and skilled photographer. She... she's also an accomplished climber under roofs, like the one outside the upstairs bedroom. What exactly did you see from that roof, Mel? You're both very impressive. You sneaky little bitch. Oh, so the tabloids can run an assault story as well as a gay story? Typical breeder move. So despite what you guys think, I'm not just some ruthless bitch. Nobody said you're ruthless. Much more likely ruthful than ruthless, wouldn't you say, Jacob? I don't know. I think she could be ruthless. No, no, no. But I don't want to be ruthless. I mean, look, I can make 10 times as much for these photos as I could for any wedding spread in a magazine. But at least it would be a good paycheck and a start on a respectable new career. And it's exactly what you want. Don't you see, Cliff? You get a gorgeous spread of you in all your heterosexual glory. Heterosexual glory, hallelujah. Plus, you'll get a great wedding album. Your bride will love it. All right, so you shoot the wedding. Cory gets an album, and then you get a sale to a magazine. And you get this little roll of film right after the wedding. See? Everybody wins. Everybody wins. You're not staying for the wedding? No, I don't think that would be an intelligent move. Why not? Well... Why were you on that roof? Oh, the, um... Well, Liberty, she... She had a misunderstanding which led her to... In a way that really wasn't conduc... conducive to... And, um... well, I figured given the circumstances, I saw an opportunity. The roof. I figured, um... well, that's where I met you. Lucky for everyone. Certainly lucky for me. So, um, you have to leave right away? Yeah, I've got to make a train at 5:00. Oh, I won't be needing much help past then, anyway. Help? Help? Help? Yeah, help. I mean, lugging this stuff in for me was really nice and helpful and all that. But I wasn't exactly planning on shooting a wedding today. It's kind of hard to do all by yourself at the last minute, you know? Would I really be a help? Sure. I guess I did get you into this. You did. My god, look at my hair. I know. Look how long mine was. Remember how my dad would never let me cut it? Only half an inch. God, you sure haven't changed much in this room. Well, I'm hardly ever here. And you know my mom likes to pretend I'm still 18. Yeah, so she can pretend she's still 40. Well, I bet this is one thing Cliff wish you would change. Oh, we sleep fine there. For sleep, yeah. But... Actually, we haven't done it. Yeah, well, here. Your mom's house right before the wedding. I guess it would be kind of romantic to hold off till the wedding night. No. I mean, we haven't done it ever. Ever? It's just, you know, with all that's been going on. Cory, that's what's supposed to be going on. When I date a guy, we do it a few times a week. Sometimes a day. Hell, Jake and I even had a double over the weekend and he's gay. I wonder how that works. He's got to be bi, you think? Yeah. Here it is. Oh, it's beautiful. Cliff's going to love it. - You want to help me? - Sure. What are you doing? The dress is great. You're going to look beautiful, radiant, the works. We got to figure out what you're going to wear tonight. But the photographer... Let me see. Well, it's kind of sexy, but very basic. So... you have any teddies? That isn't what you meant, is it? You don't have any teddies? Well, how about a sexy nightgown? Not really. Come on, you've got to give me something to work with here. Wait, I do have this. Uh, that could work for Carol Brady. I'm sorry, Lib. I've just never given much importance to this stuff. And you're the one marrying Cliff Barker and I'm being dumped by yet another guy. Jake didn't dump you. He just realized he had to be honest about who he is. It's a dump. They're all dumps. Jake comes out of the closet. Steve has to relocate. Jeff feels inferior. It's me, right? I'd like to think it's them, but... I do the aerobics. I learned how to cook. Shouldn't things be better? They will be, Lib. It's just the pressure, you know? Everybody expects my life to be perfect. I've got looks, a career. I went to this self-help weekend once. And when I stood up to tell my problems, they sent me home. Refund and everything because I didn't have any problems. My mom, my relatives, they don't fix me up with a nice, single doctor. No, Liberty's focusing on her career. She'd be married if she wanted to be. Yeah, like I just snap my fingers and anything I want comes to me. Did you really want Jake? No. I don't think so. I just wanted to bring a boyfriend to your wedding. Some maid of honor I am. No, no. It's OK. I mean, this wedding isn't one of those big affairs. We can plus one it till next week when you feel better. You would do that for me? Yeah. Cory. You're the most wonderful friend and the most stupid bride. You're getting married today. And I'm the happiest person in the whole world for you. All we need are the people. Cool. Oh, well, I'll go get them. Photographer's ready. If you're dressed, you can just head on down. Everything's set. Just come on down if you're ready. Hello? Mrs. Lindross? It's Rita, Jake. You know that. It's, um... Rita, the, uh, camera. Downstairs. Woman. Mel. The photographer? The photographer, right. She's, um... she's ready to start taking pictures. But I think she's going to want you clothed. And how would you want me? Want you? Want you! Um, I'm just... I'm going to check on the others. Who is it? Jake. The photographer is... what? That's the man who can do us some good. We need your opinion on what looks sexy. Me? But I'm, uh... Gay, yeah. We've heard. Are you sure you're not bi? No, I'm straight. Gay. Straight gay down the line. Well, you guys know better than anyone what looks good. Will that get Cliff's attention on their wedding night? Yeah, I would... I guess a straight guy would, um... there. It's lovely. Well, how about this one? Oh, don't worry about him, just one of the girls. Is this one better? No, I'd go with the first. You really ought to get into your dresses. There's only so much time for photographs before the guests start to arrive. I'll just tell the photographer you'll be a few minutes. Oh. Ooh. There certainly are a lot of doors to these rooms. Yes, there are. But that's... that's a lovely ensemble. Well, thank you, Jake. Um, so the photographer is ready? Yes, yes, yes. She's all set. Well then. Oh. Ah! Oh, Jake. You're happy to see me. I can feel it. You know, that's an involuntary muscle. You can't tell it what to do. It has it's own, uh, inner course of action. You know, um... if an older woman like me supposedly past her prime can get a reaction like that, then a young girl like Liberty. Rita, you are not past your prime. You are an attractive, vibrant woman. You really think so, Jake? Yeah. Mrs. Lind... uh, Rita? It's Liberty. This doesn't look good. No. No, no. No, it doesn't. I was just wondering... I hate to bother you, but, um, I thought that maybe... see, it's about what Cory's going to wear. Uh-huh. A problem with the dress? Uh, no, no, no. The dress is fine. It's just, you know, what she's going to wear tonight. Because it's her and Cliff's first night. I thought that maybe you might have something that she could borrow? Um, you mean, something more... Yeah, you know, kind of... Me? Yes, you. Possibly. Well, can we take a look? Um, yeah. Go ahead, honey. Um, have a look for yourself. No, I really... I don't want to disturb you. No, go ahead, disturb. No, really. I wouldn't feel right. All right. I'll look, but you stay right here. Dammit, why did you have to come out of the closet? Any particular color? Oh, well, red is usually good. Uh, scarlet or crimson, honey? Uh, scarlet. Rose or cherry? Uh, cherry, I guess, if you have it. Rita. Oh. Oh, excuse me, honey. Would this help? Sorry. I am so sorry. I was just... oh, god. Oh, god. I should have been... I, I, I... they weren't ready and I was trying to, um... Thanks. For? Everything. I never checked on Wes and Cliff. Hey. OK, so, um, put your hands in your pockets. Good. Not that far down your pockets. Come on. Well, you know, since they're in the neighborhood. OK, I need you guys to turn a little to the right. The other right. I want to do profile shots, OK? Good. Good. Jake, you know what? Can you move that reflector a little more to the left, please? Perfect. We're over here. Ne'er have I seen true beauty till this night. Wes, you don't have to stand quite that close. Just showing that the groom's got my full support. All right. All right, all right. That's it. I think they got enough pictures of the two of us. Cory, that wasn't anything. We were just like... No, I think it's sweet the way you guys play. I mean, I was a little worried from this morning, but... We have a very strong friendship. And I don't intend to let this marriage damage it one bit. Thank god. I want us all to be friends, too. OK, this is all very wonderful, but, uh, we have a lot to do before the guests arrive. So Cory, come with me. Stand by the thingy. And Cliff, next to her. Come on. And you, I'm sorry? Liberty. Liberty, next the Cory. Good. Is your mom ready yet, Cory? Oh, uh, she'll be down in a minute. New career in photography? There's just no end to what we've learned about you this weekend. And Wes, you stand over... I think that's close enough. OK, smile. Wow, that... that seemed to go well. Yeah, you make a great assistant. You make a lousy liar. I'm going to go in and call a cab. I'll be back in a minute. Great. I'll be here. Where'd you get that photographer from? Uh, she was, um... Well, we were a little short on time and stuff. So, uh... Through the mail. The mail? Yes, pretty much through blackmail... An ad in the mail. Huh. Out of the blue. Just kind of had a good feeling about her. I don't think she knows what she's doing. I mean, what's with Mr. Sock? And Jake just distracts her. I hope she gets a couple more good shots of Cory. Do you think you guys could keep Jake busy for a little while? Hi, I need a cab? Oh, uh, I'd say 4:40. It's only a five-minute ride from the Station to the train station, right? OK. Well then, yeah, my train is at 5:00. Yeah, 4:40 would be great. OK, so I'll see you in front of... um, 81 Keaton Lane... uh, Drive. Road. Thank you, of course, road. Uh, all right. So 4:40 in front. Thanks a lot. Bye. Plotting your final escape, Jake? Uh. I can't say we'll miss you, Jake. But you made it interesting. Likewise. You guys are done. So is... is Mel... Mel's outside shooting the girls. Great. Well, I just need to... Haven't you broken enough hearts today? Let her do her job. Cory's supposed to get an album out of this deal. Remember, Jake? Right. Well, I need... I need to help her. She'll manage. What do you say we help you get your things ready for the train, Jake? My things? I've got a. It's like this big. Yeah. Well, you know what? I need something to help keep me busy right now. And Jake can tell us all about sneaker infrastructure. He's an expert in the field. Really? Yeah. OK, look at his shoes, for example. The laces? - Right. - Totally redundant. - Redundant? You could be just as comfortable without laces. Redundant laces? Because the laces are just there to keep the thing... OK, just one more. Smile. OK, we're done. So I'm going to take lots of candids when the guests arrive. Of course I'll shoot the ceremony, but that's enough with the posed shots for now. Oh, thank you so much. I'm really looking forward to seeing your work. Thanks. Thanks for the vote of confidence. You'll get to see everything after your honeymoon. Oh, great. Now, did you get a lot of my daughter without anybody else around? All alone? Oh, yeah, I got tons of them before you came down. Good. Now when the guests arrive, they'll be a pretty lady, tall, attractive. Uh, that's my sister Julie. And she'll be with her husband, also tall, very charismatic. You'll want to take lots of pictures of them. Sounds like they'd be easy to... - Don't. - Don't? Don't. Done. Oh, uh, why aren't you dressed? The guests will be arriving any minute. I can't stay, Rita. It wouldn't be right. Oh, nonsense. Everybody wants you to stay. Especially Liberty. I'll go talk to her. Now, don't you go anywhere. I'm sorry. After my phone call, the guys took me upstairs. No, it's OK, really. The rest of the shoot went fine. Good. Um, I do have to leave soon, but I really want us to... Well, it was a pleasure meeting you and, uh, thanks for all your help. OK. Did I do something? No. No, you know what? It's my fault. I just pushed. And from the way you acted, I just... I must have misread the signs and didn't realize. That? That you're gay. Oh, that. The girls told you? Yeah. Libby, actually. I guess I should have known from the roof? But hey, I just thought you were joking. I wasn't exactly concentrating given the fact that I was hanging from my fingertips. But I just thought the way we were... You know, that we sort of had something. And I don't know. I tend to be a romantic and... I guess it's no excuse for just... Mel. You got me this great job and everything. And I was just hoping that you felt about me the way... Mel... Melissa. Listen to me, I'm not gay. By choice. It's... it's just the way that I am. It's nothing personal about... You see, you're really... oh, the hell with this. Listen, just stay here. I've got to go straighten myself out. They wanted a little privacy. I didn't drag you here. You could have said no. Oh, great. You could have beaten me in the office instead of here. It was Wes' idea, anyway. Yeah. Well, what about you under the covers? That wasn't me. That wasn't me the way that you think it was. Oh, and I suppose... Look, Libby, I am sorry for the lies. But I swear to god I'm telling you the truth now. I am not gay. Libby, Libby, Libby. Crap. Oh, god. Look what you did. Me? You were the one ducking. Mel, are you OK? Gay, not. Hey. She's passed out. She could really be hurt. She'll be OK. She's just stunned. What's all the... what happened to the photographer? Liberty slugged her. Honey. I mean, maybe her poses weren't flattering. But your temper, you got... No, you don't understand. I was trying to hit Jake. Oh. Why? Because he's not gay. I can see how you might become confused. No, you don't understand, he's... For sake, what the hell's going on in here? What happened to Mel? Is she all right? She'll be fine. It was Jake's fault. Me. I... Jake, haven't you caused enough trouble for one day? Every time I turn around... She was trying to hit me. Oh, please. You guys have serious issues to work out. Every time I turn around, somebody's taking a shot at me. You want to hit me again? No, hit him. Just do me a favor and hit somebody else for five minutes. It's a nice house. I'm surprised you don't have an infirmary somewhere around here. What are you doing? Get your hands off of her. I am a doctor. Is he a doctor? Yes. I'm trying to treat this poor girl who's quite clearly had a concussion. Concussion? Oh my god. Should we call an ambulance? No, no. We don't need an ambulance. I mean, it would ruin it... With the guests arriving. She'll be OK, won't she? I'm not sure yet. Oh, this is terrible. We should call off the wedding. No, we don't need to call off the wedding. Let's let Wes handle it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, let's let Wes handle it. Jake, my bag is in the bedroom upstairs. Would you get it, please? Yeah, sure. Liberty, see if you can find some small towels. Wet them with cold water. Got it. Yeah, you'll be all right. There, that didn't hurt. You really think she'll be OK? Yeah, sure. I've seen stuntman get knocked out on the set, and then all of in a sudden... they're back up and they're ready to go for the next take. So we'll still be able to have the ceremony today? Yeah. The ceremony. The honeymoon. The breezes in Jamaica, man. I'm looking forward to that. Aw. Are you glad we waited? No. But just a few more hours and you're all mine. Hey, best man. Is Mel OK? She's fine. She's, uh, resting now. I think I'll go and see how she's doing. Oh, you have the rings, right? Right here. Great. Can't get married without rings, right? You're really a much better actor than the critics give you credit for. She's got to have the weakest chin in the world. How long is she going be out for? As long as it takes. Oh, for god sakes. What are you doing? You're going to... See? That's how you do it. They must you at China shops. Oh, fine. Jake. I'm here. You OK? You ducked, didn't you? Yeah. Um, see with... with Libby, I didn't know you were there. She was a little upset, you know, with the gay, not gay thing. You know Libby. Um, when I told her I wasn't gay, she... Oh, fabulous day. See? I told you it was a dump. I need a drink. Oh, with the ceremony in an hour? You're right, but I am really tense. Well, we still have the sauna. Do I have time? Yeah, I think so. Come on. This is not an act. I care about Cory. You should. She's a terrific girl. And that's coming from someone who's not overly fond of the species. She deserves better than the lies you're giving her. Well, I'll make her happy. You can't. Not for long. You're the one always quoting Shakespeare. Think of the line from "Hamlet." What, to be... what, you think I should kill myself? No. "To thine own self be true." Oh, that one. Well, what do you want me to do? Call off the wedding? The guests are going to be here in about an hour. A few aunts, uncles, and a judge. They'll get over it. What about Cory? What about that photographer with that film? If she doesn't have a wedding spread to sell the magazine... Wait a minute. Is that? Mm-hmm. How did you get that? Just reached down and took it. When she was out? Mm-hmm. Oh. Sometimes you can be so... It's not like I enjoyed it. I did it for you. For us. You don't have to marry her now. Wes, I am not the first gay guy to get married. OK? People do it all the time. Besides, you knew from day one that this was a possibility. I'm marrying Cory. It's what I got to do. To hell with everyone else. No. I don't think so. Are you sure you should be doing this? - No. - No? No, but you know what? I've gotten so many color pictures already that I just... No, no. I mean, you just had a concussion. - A concussion? - Yeah. Nah, it's just a little bump on the chin. I'll be fine, really. All I need to do is... Whoa, Mel. How's that for a smooth move, huh? You are destabilizing. Hm, I think I like that. God, my cab is going to be here in a minute. Do you really have to go? Yeah. I have a meeting with, um... it's about sneakers and a new concept in infrastructure. Boy, I really can't explain this now. It's... it's big. Then, you go. Come on. You can shoot the rest on your own? I could have shot the whole thing on my own, but it was a lot more fun having you help. - Really? - Yeah. You sure you feel OK? I'm fine. I feel fine. I'm all set up to shoot the rest of the ceremony, and I've still got this wicked little roll of film, not that I need... it's not here. Are you sure? - Sure, I'm sure. - Well, did you lose it? There's not that much room in here. Then? Somebody took it. Bug. Big bug. Yes, I'm familiar with them. Listen, gay or not, you had no business sticking your hand down there. Down where? I was going to give you guys the roll of film, anyway. Come on, I know you now. I wouldn't blackmail you. Well, we couldn't take the chance. And I apologize for the intrusion. Uh, don't worry about it. So, um, what'd you do with the film anyway? Gave it to Cliff. He's going to destroy it, isn't he? Well, there are a few shots I'd hope he blow up for enlargements. But no accounting for his tastes these days. Dammit. It was some of my best work, too. Oh, that's my cab. Come on, I guess I'll walk you out. It's been memorable. It certainly has, Jacob. Hey, what you got there? Uh, it was just... the rings. Can I see them? Please, please, please? We really shouldn't. Come on. I've been dying to see them. Would you show her. It's not the rings. It's just an envelope. What's this bumpy thing? It's personal. And I think I just have enough time before ceremony to mail it in the box on the road. Have a nice life, Jake. What's he mailing to "The National Enquirer?" Oh my god, it's my film. Come back here, Wes. You can't do that. I made a deal with Cliff. But I didn't. Oh, come on, Wes. That's... Whoa. Ow. No, no, no. You've got a train to catch. But the... the film? That's my problem. You've done enough already. Call me. - Excuse me. - Is there a problem? Uh, no. I just, um, need some air. Oh, good. Gorgeous out there, isn't it? You always have to be so careful when you're planning an outdoor event. But I think we got lucky, don't you? Yes, it's lovely. Oh, you're looking much better. You know, you gave us quite a scare. Oh, yeah. I'm fine now. Good, because I was wondering, maybe you could take some pictures of me with my daughter outside in the backyard? Oh, fine idea. I'll go check the light. Good. I'll go get Cory. Great. Whoa. Whoa. OK? Hey. Finders keepers, losers weepers. Hey, Jake. You got a damsel in distress there. You're going to miss your train, buddy. Come on. I thought you were catching the 5 o'clock train out of town. I was. That's why I'm going to kill you now. You can have the ceremony here if you like. But I was just wondering... honey, maybe you should consider having it over there. I mean, it would be so lovely with the sunset behind you. What do you think? Well, if you want it over there, that's... Oh, no, honey, it's what you want. Where's Mel? It's not that. Well then, what is it, honey? I don't know. It's... it's the mood. There's been so much tension today. The fight. Honey, everything's just fine. You're dealing with some very volatile personalities, that's all. I mean, you know how Liberty is. And Cliff's an actor. They're very emotional people. He just hasn't seemed at ease since Wes arrived. Well, honey, Wes is his best friend and he doesn't have any real family. He's probably nervous about what Wes thinks. Maybe. But sometimes I think... Careful! You'll get your dress dirty. Oh, honey, everybody's feeling fine. I mean, now that everything's straightened out with Jake, and the photographer's conscious. Everybody's going to be a lot more relaxed and at ease. Or maybe not. Men, even at weddings they're still such little boys. I'll just go get my camera. You do that. Cory, I'm going to take a sauna like you said. But I promise, I'll be showered and dressed before the guests arrive. Good. I'm so sorry you missed your train. Oh. So am I. I couldn't let your photos get used that way. Thanks. Listen. They're waiting for me out back, so could you give this to Cliff for me? Sure. Cliff, quick! Grab him! He stole the film. Grab him. Don't let him get away! "National Enquirer?" You lying bastard. No. Cliff, we were. I tried to get it back myself. I didn't want to upset you right before the ceremony. Thanks. That's was very thoughtful of you. No, Cliff.. You shut up. You just shut up. Give me the film. I'll put it somewhere safe. Thanks. God, you actors really are as dumb as people say. We weren't mailing it to the tabloids, he was! What's all the... have a nice game of touch football? You let me in, Wes. Come on, there's now where for you to go. What the hell is going on here? It's, uh, just a game. Sort of a groom/best man thing. Well, stop it. That's sort of a maid of honor thing. Open the god damn door. Cory's had enough to upset her today. Libby, are you in there? Open the door. Open the door, Lib. Libby, open it. No. No, no. I'm not playing your game. Wes. And what's with the envelope? It's, uh, nothing. Let me see it. It's not good. He locked that door, too. Wes, open the god damn door. Calm down, it's not like he's going anywhere. The window. Come on. Wes. I'm being nice and civil here, now let me see the envelope. It's none of your concern. You'd be amazed what a concerned individual I am. Oh, you crazy... if I wasn't a doctor... Yeah, sure. Oh, now look what you've done. Baby. Where'd he go? Oh. I think he went out the window. Well, he better have wings because when I find him, I'm going to... No, Cliff. You go out the window. We certainly rang Liberty's bell. She lives by the sword. Something about this film that seems to cause any woman who has it to end up unconscious. For safety sake, I better get rid of it. Cliff, what's the matter? Um, nothing. Um, everything's fine. Have you seen Wes? Well, he went that way a few minutes ago with Jake. - But since then? - No. Did you guys have a fight? Uh, not really. You did. He's not going to be your best man. Oh, god. Does he have the rings? Did he take the rings? We can't get married without the rings. Honey, it doesn't matter. They're just a symbol, aren't they, Cliff? Uh, right. Right. Um, everything's going to be fine. We're going to get married no matter what. What does that mean? I'll explain in a minute. I'll go keep an eye on him. But... come on, I want to find out what's going on. No. This way, it's faster through the house. Cliff, he's out in front. And I'm on the roof. That should make for a soft landing. Oh. Weren't you leaving? I am. Not another step, or the mailbox gets it. Wes, don't do this to me. This is my whole career. Your career? And that makes everything you're doing OK because it's for your career? It's a terrible thing you'd be doing, Wes. Oh, really, a terrible thing? What do you think, Jake? You must have a thought on what I a villain I am. You, who dropped his girlfriend on the spot when it meant getting to a business meeting on time. And Miss Photographer who took these pictures and planned on doing just what I am, but simply for money. And you, my love, would marry a sweet young girl whom you can't possibly give the love she deserves. Yes, you three are standing here telling me what an evil thing I'm doing. I'm the only one doing the honest thing. I'm the only one doing what I really believe in. And it's not for my career. It's for love. Please don't. I don't know what that is, but it's obviously going to hurt Cliff. And I don't want him hurt anymore today. Anymore? Cliff, I can't marry you. - Are you... -No, no. It's all been too fast. You're a great guy, and I got all caught up in the wedding thing, but I'm not ready. We're not ready. I know. You know? I know. - Does Cliff know you know? - No. And I don't want him to know. - No? - No. Are you OK? I'm fine. How about you? I'm a little disappointed and a complete mess, but I'm fine. Everything's going to be just fine. Here you go, Jacob. You wanted it so badly. Well, it doesn't look like she'll be selling any big wedding spread. And I don't need to. So, what time did you say that meeting of yours was? 9:00. Well, I do have a car and nothing to keep me here. It's over 200... if we drove... we just might make it. - We just might. - Come on. Jake. Jeff, you just missed him. No, I have no idea where he went. Yeah, I guess I could take a message. Tonight's meeting is cancelled. What meeting? Now, where could that have... ah. Never know when this might come in handy.
