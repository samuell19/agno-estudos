The characters and events portrayed in this film are fictitious even though certain real events may have been used for inspiration and were fictionalized or invented for purposes of dramatization. "Cruise ships out". It's fiction! Just a fiction! Thanks, thanks a lot! Long live Carnival! The whole fiesta, guys, is fiction! Young folks can't handle their booze! Come here, come here, come with your little friend, come! - Why not? - Because it doesn't suit it. Why not? It's in fashion and the pants are gorgeous. That's true. And I have the perfect blond wig for the pigtails. Susana, listen: We're going to the Venice Carnival, remember? - People don't go as Harley Quinn. - What do they go as? Historical figures. Harley Quinn's been in the comics for years. - She's been the Joker's girl forever. - Right? Harley Quinn isn't a historical figure, okay? They'll be period costumes, those big skirts, - with masks, like... - Like what? - Like in fairy tales. - Yes, true. Sad, with tears. Sad, no, mysterious. - You can be Cinderella. - Fuck no, not Disney princesses. Christ! What did you do at school? - Aw, honey. - Apart from that. We've hired the costumes and they're classy, okay? This isn't Las Vegas. Okay. - Pretty historical figure: Marie Antoinette. - Who's Marie Antoinette? - Fuck, Jose, don't shit me. - They cut off her head. - Cut off her head? Why? - Really? The fucking French Revolution! Don't pick on your brother, he's a cutie. Cutie to you, but to me he's an idiot who went off partying while I stayed studying. Hey, I can't find my passport. - Did you look properly? It'll be there. - I lose everything. Have you checked your bag? Here, let me see. Look what he's got. I had no idea they were there. I must've had them for years. Right, now you are sleeping in another room, eh? - No, I bought them for us. - They're expired, that's gross. He can sleep with his sister, right, Isa? - Shut up, asshole! - You shut up, clown! You're latching onto Susana, but you're only here because Alfonso didn't come. Thanks for reminding me, I almost forgot. - This was to be three couples. - No, two couples and maybe Susana. I don't know why the fuck I'm always alone. If hooking up with your brother bugs you, I'll give him a miss. - I'm not that into him. - You two relax, eh? - We're here to have fun. - Right, babe? It'll be there somewhere. Right, guys, I'm going to explain what's going to happen. Tonight we'll dress up, go out for some tequilas and then dance until they have to carry us to bed. - Anything wrong with that? - Nothing crazy, I'm getting married. - What's that got to do with it? - This could be your bachelorette party. - No, no, get off! - Yeah, yeah. No bachelorette party, no surprises. No. The next boat leaves from Murano in 10 minutes. Ha! I've got one for everyone. Come here. - No, no. No, no. - Give it to me! - Give it to me. - Yeah, yeah. Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! It's all your fault, fucking tourists! Cruise ships out! You destroy everything you touch. They're saying it's our fault, we destroy everything we touch. - What did we do? We only just got here. - Come on, let's go. We're from Spain, this is a bachelorette party, got it? Come on, let's go. Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Move it, move it! But we just got here. Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! - This'll be our taxi. - It's wood. - These bags are heavy. - Jose, have you got everything? Good morning. - Stop complaining. - Hey, this is full of shit. Buongiorno is better. - Spanish? - Yes. Spanish... It's heavy. - This is great. - Arantza, wait, I can't get down. - Good morning. Go ahead, miss. - I'm Isa. - Giacomo. - Giacomo. - Careful, don't fall. - I can do it alone. - Look what I got you, hon'. - Olé! Where's the city? What about the city? It'll be that way. I don't know. Fuck, fuck, fuck! - Jose! - Jose! Jose! Jose! Jose, wait until we get to the hotel swimming pool. How can you be so clumsy? - Fuck. - C'mon, help. Will you stop attracting fucking attention?! If I jump, will you help me? Christ, Jose. - Fuck. - No! Now I've lost all my contacts. Don't you have them in the cloud? I don't use it, they steal your data and control your photos. - How do you follow Insta, Facebook? - I don't have them. No fake identities and crap on the Net for me. He's a free spirit. This free spirit is in a fucking bind now. You can't locate me, track me or find some photo to blackmail me. Who'd blackmail you, you idiot? You're nobody. Asshole. - Poor boy, poor boy. - Little thing... - Take that off, you're soaked. - You'll freeze. Take if off. Jose, seriously, take off your clothes, you'll get fucked up. - Take it off, please. - Get on. You might get a cold and Mom will blame me. C'mon, shit. Take off your clothes or it's no good. - Leave me, I can do it. - You're such an asshole... Asshole. - This guy's a bummer, huh? - Fuck, it's cold. - What's that? - Real film, not video. - What's that? - Where did you get that? - Someone left it at home. - Someone! - The director for the ad I did last week. - Yeah, sure! - You shot it in your house? - No, Jose, honey. - What was the ad? - Victoria's Secret. - Sure. - Sure, what? Will you please stop judging me for one second? C'mon, bitches, make it sexy! Is that everything? You look like my mom's friends. - C'mon, those curves! - Go, go! Let's go, let's go! - Go for it, go! - Don't be boring, go! C'mon, go, butt. A little booty here. Long live Venice! Jose, I can see your... Check out that booty! Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. A little bit cold. I'm staying here. It's nice. - Everything alright? - Yeah, yeah. Do you know there's an island that's a cemetery? - That's fun, a cemetery. - Lots of famous people are buried there. And palace parties. There must be a private party, right? Look up "masquerade party". You can only go to those if you know someone. - There's another island full of ghosts. - Forget the islands. - We could do a Ouija board. - Or play Scattergories. You two are so lame. I'd rather go partying than talk to spirits. You do as your told, we're paying for the extra room. - Cancel it, I'll sleep with Susana. - If I want you to, kid. You were going to sleep with me but you insisted on your own room. Is it so weird to not want to sleep with your sister? Do you know the shit we kicked up at the agency - to book an extra room? - It's a package thing, man. Now you're not using it! Fuck it, - you never think of anyone else. - I don't mind, Jose. - If you want to sleep with Javi... - Fuck that. - Pajama party. - No fucking way. Maybe I'll stay up and party all night. - As long as I don't see you... - Listen to this: "In the Middle Ages, the Plague killed hundreds of thousands of people. They didn't want the corpses in Venice, so they left them on the island". - Can't we talk about something else? - The worst part is that they started to take the sick there. Can you imagine? You couldn't see the ground for all the corpses. And you're alone, dying, stepping on that. Okay. What's the name of this wonderful place we can't miss? Poveglia. The island of Poveglia. If you want, I can show it to you. We have other plans, thanks. We can all go to the opera together. I have tickets. I have tickets. - Tickets, tickets. - I've never been to the opera. - Or to school. Shut up. - Thank you. Look, look. Tickets, tickets. - What opera is it? - Rigoletto. Isn't the lead a jester? Yes, I am Rigoletto. The Duke of Mantua wants to steal my precious daughter, but I will not allow it. I'll have my revenge. - Okay, okay... - Yes, I'll have my revenge! Bravo, bravo! Revenge, terrible revenge, - is all that my soul desires. - Excuse me... Revenge! - Revenge. Revenge. - Careful! - Excuse me! - Please! Get the fuck off! That'll do! Enough! Enough! - Did he hurt you? - Like he hurt me...! Get out of here! - Fuck that guy! - Close up! Are you alright? Surreal! Thank you, thank you. Wow, man! - Who said it was better than Vegas? - It's wonderful, a dream, water everywhere! It gives me the creeps, girl. Look, the feathers, the sequins, the glitter, the porcelain faces. It's fucking creepy. You're pure poetry, Javi, I don't know what I saw in you. I fuck like a bunny. It must be that. Ciao, ciao. - Thanks for everything. - Have a good time. - Take this for you? - Yes, the bag. - How much is it? - No, no, no. - Yes. - No, with what happened... - We'll pay him some other way. Let's go. - Thank you. Let's go. - Right. Ciao. - Ciao. I'm woozy, eh? And you didn't want to come. Whoah! - Are you buying me a mask? - No, it's a rip-off, girl. Wow, cool costumes! - Girl, this is... A selfie? - Go on. Selfie, girls. - Look nice. - Fuck off. - Go for it. - You asshole, Jose. Veeenice! - Right, that's it. - Cool photo. - Come on. - Where is it? - Yes, that way. - That way? - Did you look? - Jose, you're dragging everything. - How can it be this way? - Yes, Susana, it's this way. - Imagine if that jester popped out. - Shut up. - Revenge! - Shut up! - Ciao. - Good morning. - Oh, sorry. - Yes. What? - Susana. - What? Dinner? - Could we do this later? - No. - I'm going up for a piss. - I'll go with you. Jose, take your fucking bag. Alright... Now this is more like it. Fuck, this is swank! Fuck, I'm cold! You bet. Don't nod off now, asshole. Call a doctor. I think I have a fever. - You gonna fuck Susana? - You're pissed off, eh? She's hot. - Lucky you! - I don't know, she thinks I'm funny. Your sister doesn't find it fucking funny. Fuck her. I'm fucking sick of her big sister routine. It's cute, right? Are these the costumes? - It's heavy! - They can bring it up. - Pass my phone, Susana. - Do I take the bags? - I'm going up. - The kid's fucking bag. Go on. - Isn't the lift...? - There's no lift, it's Venice. - How can there be no lift? - This weighs a ton. Come on, it's nothing. Javi, here's your costume. Jose? - Having a shower. - He couldn't wait for his room? - Does he want to occupy all of them? - He was freezing, I don't know. He's wet the sheets. - Really! - This doesn't fit. - Fuck you, it'll show off your junk. - What the hell's up with you? You're being a pain in the ass. He falls in the water. You shirk everything and go up to smoke a joint. - What? - Do you think I'm an idiot? It stinks. You can't smoke in these rooms, and it's weed as well. You two are assholes. - You're looking fine, Arantza. - Shut up. - Wanna fuck? - No, when I say you're an asshole... - Why not? - Your buddy's having a shower. - Fuck, your abs turn me on. - A-list sportswoman, man. - What difference is there to B? - This. Is this white one Isa's? It looks like a wedding dress. Isn't that bad luck? - Now you know what heels are like. - You actually wear these things! - Wow! - Good evening. Girl, this is wild. Good evening. And this, bitches, is called a spectacular entrance. Tits up, ass out. Let's paint Venice red. - Ciao. - Ciao. To Venice! It cost a packet, but it's worth it. You have to do it once in your life. Just once, it's so expensive. - Yes, I'm ordering a salad. - One for everyone. Don't be stingy. Shit, to the booze-up we're gonna have. But no overdoing it, I have to get married. - She's getting married. - Please, it's your last chance. As of tomorrow you'll be in the hell of marriage forever. You're just dying of jealousy. Sure, it must be that. Fuck, she's my sister. What's wrong? Sorry to bother you. Are you tourists? Is it that obvious? The costumes are splendid. When did you arrive? - Today. - This afternoon. On a cruise ship. I understand that you're open to new experiences. I have the privilege of inviting you to a private party of a friend of mine. It's near here. We can walk. Let's say that it's an exclusive celebration - and requires certain discretion. - We're very discreet. - Susana, please. - Don't spoil it. Sorry, but we're not the kind of girls who accept invitations from strangers. - Thank you. - We're not? Every weekend... - Does the invitation include us? - Apparently not. - Girl, we don't know him from Adam. - If you want, we'll ask for his ID. - But you can't see his face. - He's wearing a mask, like everyone. I'm sorry. Some other time. I hope you have a pleasant evening. Until next time. What a jerk. That jerk meant fucking fun, but our friend Isa fucked it. - How could you say no to him? - He scared me. - Good, it's more exciting. - No, it's alright, you see an Italian in a mask and go crazy. No, he was in the know. Carnival... Carnival, I love you... I love you, honey. - I trod in it by accident. - Cut it out, always the same. Run, run, run! I can't, I can't! It stinks of shit. Gross! What's that? What does it mean? Killers Street. Let's not go down there. Further up is Killers Fountain, where people met to kill each other. - Jose, you're treading on me. - Sorry. Look. - You've never seen him like this. - Which do you like more? I like this one and this one. Hi. I'm going to ask this person. Excuse me, a place with the music molto loud... - Really loud. - hot waiters... and gin, very cheap gin. - That's right. - Really cheap. I have no idea. I'm sorry. I'm only a bear. What's he saying? Okay. Okay. - Why ask a bear? - She likes them hairy. - Leave the bottle, we'll serve ourselves. - Very well. Okay. You know what scares me? - We can't find the hotel? - No, missing these moments. - Seriously? - Yes. It's a lot of things. Going to London, living as a couple... What if his feet stink and we don't like the same series? Wasn't he the perfect man? Until you commit yourself, you never know. - So I don't want any trouble. - Excuse me, you want trouble like everyone does, but you just can't. I can't? Because you're gorgeous and that scares people. - Since when is that a problem? - For fucking, it's perfect. But at the moment of truth, guys prefer normal girls, like Arantza and me, right? No, don't involve me, I don't want to know. Don't be a wimp, say it. - Well, maybe, yeah. - Do I scare you now? - Or what? - What are you doing, girl? - What am I doing? - What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! You bitch. You're right, but you're a bitch. And you guys suck, you're scared to not be in control. I love you anyway, eh? We're in the north, I think. This is a fucking maze. You don't say! Tourism has risen by 400% in 5 years. We're talking about 27 million visitors a year, over 75,000 a day. All because of cruise ships. Does this influx of people endanger the city? I'll just say one thing: One must forget the past - and think of the future. - Thank you. I'm not saying we should go crazy and run off, but that guy's out there. - What guy? - The doctor. - Shit! - Shit! Let's go! You haven't paid! Fucking tourists! The shoe! The shoe! - Move it, move it! - C'mon, let's go! - Look. - Careful, careful. - He's there. - Run! Come on. What do we do? Let's go. Fuck, fuck, fuck! - Ring it. - Ring it. They'll ask us for a flyer, an invitation or something. We say we're friends of the doctor. - That's it. - Sure, sure. Why didn't we go in with him? - We were late. What's the problem? - That's it. Ring. Knock, knock. Rigoletto? - Rigoletto, man. - Fuck, that's cool. Hi. Ciao. Come in. This is... I just decided: This is my bachelorette party! Fucking great! Yeah! Jose! Jose! Fuck! Arantza, what's wrong? No, calm down, I can't understand you. Don't shout, please. Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming. My brother's not here. He's not here? He's not here. He's not in the hotel. I don't care. I'm calling him, but he must be out of range or whatever. Or underwater, remember? What the fuck happened? - No fucking idea. - Didn't he come with you guys? No, we thought he was up ahead, with you. Arantza and I are the kid's minders now. We're all grown-ups here. Don't stress out, he's scored with some waitress at the party. You were into them, eh, you fuck? You couldn't keep your eyes off them. This isn't like Jose. Sure, that's why he had his bag full of condoms. Alfonso. Alfonso, honey, how are you? Good. I can't talk now, I'll call you in a while, okay? Alright. You get on great, huh? You tell each other everything. - Piss off. - They have no secrets. If I tell Alfonso that one of us disappeared in a party where half the people ended up naked, he'd get the first plane here. Is that what you want? Nobody says anything until it's strictly necessary, please. Hey, Drama Queens. Jose will be here in an hour with a stinking hangover. - What did you book exactly? - Two doubles and a standard. You've looked in his room, right? Jose Luis García. Honey, I'll call you back, okay? What kind of shitty hotel is this? Look properly! - Arantza, Arantza. - Look properly! - You mixed up the booking. - It could've been you. - Don't yell at me. - Let's call the police. Call the police? He'll turn up in no time. - What if something happened to him? - Alright, who saw him last? He was talking to... - to that guy, the... - The doctor? Fuck! God! Thank you. How are you, Guido? Sorry to bother you, but these Spanish kids say they've lost one of their friends. The usual. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Thanks. Good morning. My name is Guido Brunelli, captain, San Zaccaria precinct. I'm sorry you had to come here. So someone hasn't returned to the hotel as expected. - My brother, he doesn't usually do this. - No one usually does, - but he met someone and... - Are you going to help us or not? - Do you have a photo? - Yes, we took a selfie yesterday. - He's not in it. - Why? - He's being a dick with the blanket. - He fell in the water and got soaked. Don't you even have one? - Maybe, his passport... - He's not registered in the hotel. What? Didn't he come with you? - Yes. - I told you, he was soaked and went up to change. Whoever he is, he doesn't have a room here. She says he doesn't have a room. Because he went up to ours. Why are they going on about it? The costumes! We hired five costumes. Get him to come. But he would've spoken to someone, I assume. What's wrong? Do you think we're making it up? No one thinks anything here. I need to know everything your friend did. He got changed, up in the room. - What else? - We had dinner, went to a party... - Right, you drank. - Of course we drank. Susana, please. - There was a man at the party. - What did he look like? - We didn't see his face. - He had a plague doctor mask on. And you think this man may be involved. Excuse me. Yes. Brunelli. Very well. Right away. - He's not taking us seriously. - He judged us straight away. It's the way it is. I'm sorry, I must leave you, I have work to do. I thought only we tourists made you waste your time. - The summit is on Wednesday. - What summit? The bilateral meeting between Italy and France. As if that weren't enough, protesters want to boycott it. - Cruise ships out. - Bravo, that's it exactly. The ocean liners. Did you come on a cruise ship? - Yes. - Yes. Then you're to blame. Nothing on the networks. Only one Jose García, but he's a French actor. How could we not take a single photo of him on the trip? He's fucking stubborn, he didn't want one. The weekend in El Escorial. He came on Sunday. I don't have him in my phone. Wait, wait. Fuck, the Super 8. I'm sorry, but we don't take those items anymore. We don't develop film. It's all digital now. Yes, wait a moment. No, that's not it. Alright... - Google shows 8 more stores. - Let's go. That way. - No. - Let's stop for a moment. - What are we doing? - Looking for Jose. Sure, Isa, but it's our vacations. What are you saying, Javi? You want a beer? - You want a pizza? - I'd love a fucking beer. Until we find Jose, we can't sit back, so... He's not 7 years old. He's fucking somebody, like any single guy. - Javi, enough! - You pig. You're just jealous. - Arantza, don't shit me. - If you're so keen, join him. - We have to find the black door. - We're going back there? It was night, all the streets look the same. We backtrack from the hotel. - Do you have an Ibuprofen? - Yes. - Isa, we went the wrong way. - No. - No, it wasn't this way. - Yes, yes. We were here and we went in there, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's them. There they are. This man says you didn't pay the bill. - That's why we're here. - A bottle of tequila. Whatever. One, two, three, four. Like yesterday. He says there were four of you too. This guy's a jerk. - Sorry? - This has an explanation. Jose was outside smoking, he mustn't have seen him. Look, we're not crazy, if that's what you're getting at. Someone must've seen Jose, okay? We're going to prove it. Let's go to the black door. - The black door? - You're scared, eh? The worst is yet to come. - Shut up! - Revenge! Revenge time! Arantza, I don't think it was this way. What do you know, Javi? You get lost on Gran Vía. Faster. - Here? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. Alright... - They won't open up. - I'll come back with a warrant. What is it? Carabinieri, madam. Just a quick check. Excuse me. Let's go. Alright... No. There was a passageway and stairs going down. This isn't it. Let's go. - Sorry, madam. It's alright. - Really? I'll tell you one thing. Whatever it is, there couldn't be stairs going down. - Why? - Because of the water! Venice is supported on wooden posts driven into the mud. You can't build underground. Look, I'm sure your brother will turn up sooner or later. Let's give it some time. My number. What's the word...? - I don't know. Airport? - The translator. Hello. Hello. I need to go to the airport, please. - I have a taxi there. - Isn't this a taxi? Luigi, I'll take care of it. You relax. - Giacomo, right? - Yes. You remember? I'm going to the airport. I think the Consulate is there. - Yes, it is. Is there a problem? - You're going to the Consulate? - Yes. The police won't help us. - Look, Isa, aren't we going overboard? Do what you like. Jose's vanished. I'm not sitting around waiting for him. Okay. Someone should stay in can he turns up. Go to the hotel, I can do it alone. I'll go with you. This is killing me. I can't handle this girl. Don't be a dick. He's her brother, she's scared, it's normal. Normal? She's a fucking nutcase! She's fucking up my vacations and this cost me a fortune. - You know what a day in Venice costs? - Piss off. EVERY STORM BEGINS WITH A SINGLE DROP Hello. - Isabel García? - Yes. No need for you to come. I could've told you over the phone. What? - Your brother, Jose García... - Yes. Can't you call him? No, I explained that to your workmate. We're here to expedite passports and control the legitimacy of judicial procedures. So even if we had 20 photos and his phone on GPS, you couldn't do anything. Very little. My feet hurt. I'm thirsty. - This is bullshit. - Would you rather wait at the hotel? I'd rather get lost next time. I'd be fucking sweet, having a gin and tonic. The last one. It has to be here. Mamma, I can't now, I've got customers! What did I tell you? You don't fucking listen to me. You pig! You like sleeping with Spanish tourists! Mamma, shut up. That's enough! Let's go, a beer. - See that palace? - Which one? The one with the pizzas? It's Ca'Dario. It's cursed. All of its owners since the 15th century were murdered or died in an accident. - I don't give a shit. - You're so obnoxious. This sucks, running around all day... The Who's manager bought it and died falling down the stairs. Who are The Who? A 70s rock band. Now it belongs to an American multimillionaire. It'd be good to meet him. You marry him, wait until he falls down the stairs, I turn up and we keep the house. Javi, he's gay. That's fine. I'll marry him. Don't worry about your friend. He's in good hands. - What did you do to him? - What do you want? Money? There still people in this world not motivated by money. But, of course, you don't understand that. Don't move. My brother thinks he's got it all under control, but I have to go after him, doing the dirty work. What are you going to do? How will you get out of here? With these things, the less you think, the better. The key is to not get nervous and to do it fast. Isn't it incredible? Nobody saw anything. It's like it never happened. Honey! Where are you going? She's jealous. Wait for me. Claudia. Good evening, Giacomo. The lady's waiting. Thanks. Jose's not back. And Arantza and Javi aren't in their room. I spoke to my workmates and to Water Taxi, but nothing. Alfonso. Honey, I can't talk now. I'm behaving myself. Are you? If staying here all night doing overtime to get these people's trust is behaving myself, then yes, I'm an angel. I'd rather be with you there in a gondola, going down the canals. Isa. Isa, please pick up. You know? I've got a flight here that leaves tomorrow at 7. No, no, it's a mess and... It's really not worth it, this isn't how we imagined it. Why? Rats run down the streets at night. - Don't you want me to come? - No, it's not that. It's just... The girls wouldn't take it well. You said it wasn't a bachelorette party, Javi and your brother were going. Sure... Alfonso, I have to go, okay? I can't talk now, they have to call me. - Aren't you with them? - Yes, we're all together. I'm in my room waiting for them to call me to dinner, okay? - Stop interrogating me. - Okay, right. We'll talk some of the time. Fuck. Isa! Isa! It's Arantza. Hold on. Yes? Isa. Can you hear me? Isa... Arantza? What's wrong? I'll send you my location, come and get me. What? Let's go. It's here. You have nothing to fear, we'll look after you. Next time I'll kill you, you've gone completely mad. You'll screw it all up. Get the girl and let's go. Arantza! Arantza! It's here. Arantza! Arantza! - Are you sure? - Let's see. - What the hell is going on here? - Fuck. I need to know what you remember of the party, anything can help. They were all masked, even the waiters. They had candelabras, on their heads. And large bottles with a murky, very sweet yellow liquid. - Yellow... like grappa? - No, it was... What was it called? Theriaca. No, it can't be Theriaca. Why? What's wrong? Is it a drug? No, it's an ancient beverage. - They say it's magical. - Magical! Are you kidding? - It hasn't been used for centuries. - What's in it? Nothing good. I gave you a chance out of respect for our father. But I clearly made a mistake. You never take me seriously. He's like a rabid dog. He has to be kept on a leash. - He's your brother. - Yes, but he's ruining everything. After this murder no one will listen to us. There's no need. It may be the only way they'll listen to us. What are you talking about? About fear. Only fear will stop them. The only thing that will get them away from here. What are you thinking of? Actually, we've always known. It was the only way, but we didn't want to admit it, until this idiot... Do you think we should let him do it? It's all sinking, Hugo. Not just this house, your whole life is sinking. These people have no scruples. If we frighten them, they won't dare come back. Think about it. Let him go. We know where he's going. They used to make Theriaca here. Now they sell souvenirs. THE GOLDEN HEAD Gina! Gina! Giacomo. How can you turn up as if nothing was wrong? - You bastard! - It's no time to make a scene. Are they tourists? Your friends? Out for a stroll? - No. Your father. - Upstairs, as usual. Why? Are you finally giving him back the money? - That's why I love you. Yes. - Sure. You liar! - Girls. - Go on up. Please. - Go on up. - Go up, cuties. Have fun. Bastard! You owe me 500 euros. That's not why I'm here. From what I see, you're not here for Gina either. Theriaca. You haven't been to the meetings for a long time. - We'll talk later. - You're for us or against us. Come on! Despite the protesters, the summit will be held normally and problem-free. Nobody can stop the rise of the new Venice. Wait and see. Listen, two lads have disappeared. It seems they drank Theriaca or something similar. Similar, it could be. But it's impossible that it's Theriaca. Who can get a unicorn horn these days? It has poisonous plants, viper skin, opium... Some 70 ingredients. All the pharmacies made it until it was banned. Yes? - Hi, how are you? - Something's happened, something serious. Yesterday we went to a party and... Fuck. - Fuck, what? - I told you - I didn't like you going alone. - Alone? Alone, Isa, without me, alone. Could you stop thinking about yourself and listen to me? I don't know if I want to listen to you. - You have no idea what's happening. - No, Isa, I have no idea. You know why? I've been calling you for two days, two days and no word. Are you with someone? Put that down. Pick her up. Hello. Arantza. Jose. What are you doing here? Sorry to wake you so early. - What's going on? - This won't be pleasant. It won't be easy to recognize him. - What? No, no, no, no! - Cover him up! - Let go of me! Let go of me! - No, no! - Fucking let go of me! - Get off, fuck! Wait, wait, wait! - You're fucking kidding me! - It's Javi. Let me see him! Let me see him! No, no, no, no! Fucking hell! It's Javi. Javi! Isa! Isa! It's Javi. Let go of her! Wait, wait! Let go of her! You laugh? I'll leave you on the buoy! Shall I leave you on the buoy? Shall I let you die here? It's alright, take it easy! Let go of her! Look, look, street theatre! Let go of her! Out of the way! He's crazy! You're to blame! The jester is great! Is it real? He's very good! They will die like pigs. Their heads must be cut off! Like beasts! They will wait. Believe me, Giacomo, no one... no one will try to stop me. No! No, no! Isa! Look, that blood looks real! Bravo! Bravo! Look at her cry! It's just for show, right? An act, an act! It's an act! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Great, really. Bravo! Let me... - Fucking trip. - Jose. Why the fuck did I say yes to my sister? No one's to blame for this. Bullshit! We could've gone to Lanzarote, to Ibiza, any fucking normal place. Relax, we'll get out of this. You think so? - Yes. - They must have the wrong people. It must be a mistake. We should notify the family of his death. No, no, please. Isa, why don't we go? - What about Jose... and Arantza? - What about us? First Jose, then Javi, you know what I mean? It's no coincidence. Do you want to stay here until they get us? Susana, I'm not going to argue with you. The people at the party set their sights on us. They're following us, watching us. I'm not going without them, is that clear? No one should leave the lagoon until all this is cleared up. That man in "plague doctor" costume must've paid for his dinner, right? He paid in cash. Do you know what this is? It was on the lintel of the black door and in the souvenir store. It's... a symbol... an ancient symbol. Secret societies used it. It's everywhere, in some recent graffiti as well. It seems that someone's revived it. A secret society for what? Some guy out there is spying on us. Stop! Were you spying on us? Why? Super 8. - Super 8. - What did he say? Super 8, your camera cartridge. Arantza had it. I recognized them. They're the girls in the photo. Those girls, I've seen them. The girls in the photos. Super 8. You look like my mom's friends. - ¡C'mon! - Go, go, go! Guys! A little booty here! Jose. Jose. Who's that? Revenge, terrible... - Stop the video. - God damn...! The peak will be at 11:00 pm. We'll use code words to make the searches easier: "Mass tourism", "terror", "revenge". We calculate that in two hours there'll be over 2 million views. How long will it take to locate us? It'll be hard to trace the IP. How long? One hour. No, hold it. I don't know you and you don't know me. I only know that we trust each other because we're Venetians. Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Giacomo, why aren't you with us? It's a farce. A farce? That monster spits out hundreds of thousands of bastards every day. They're tourists, they give us a living. You're on their side. Traitor! Bastard! Traitor! Cruise ships out! Cruise ships out! Where to? Palazzetto Pisani, please. I'M ALMOST THERE Go away! I said go away! I'm going out for a moment. - I'm fed up. - Sorry, sorry. Excuse me. MUSIC IN VENICE "THE SOUNDS OF CARNIVAL" MANIN THEATER - RIGOLETTO Does this exist? We'll check. TRAGIC ACCIDENT IN VENICE Many residents of the ancient city feared that something like this would happen. 9 floors high, weighing 65,000 tons and able to transport 2,500 passengers. Out of control. THE YOUNG MAN DIED TODAY These are images of the tragic accident of last May 14. From the hospital we're told that Fabrizio Lizardo, 24, died today due to an accident during a protest march. You shouldn't look at that. I know you still do too. It gives me strength. One more motivation. He and I never understood each other. He'd be so proud of you today. Steel yourself. You have to talk to everyone. No masks. No masks. Isa! I'm alright. I'm alright. Good evening. - Good evening. - Isabel García? No. What's this? He's been robbing tourists for years. No, no. It's not just theft. It's something else. Call Brunelli. Giacomo! Giacomo! Giacomo! - Where are you? - Giacomo! Yes, Brunelli. Who's this? We're in the Manin Theater. Manin Theater. Very well. I'll be right there. - I'm going down. - What? - I'm going! - No, no, no! Isa! Fuck! Giacomo! Giacomo! Giacomo! - Are you alright? - Isa! Susana! Fuck! Hold on! Susana! Where are they? What have you done with them? They're visiting the islands. Your friends are doing some tourism, that's all. Isn't that what you came for? Isa! Susana! Isa! Isa! Help me! Help me! Pull, pull, pull! Are you alright? Yes! Revenge! Terrible revenge! Susana! No! Help me get her down! Susana! Susana! Susana! Hold on, Susana! Hold on! Hold on! Help me! Help me get her down! Fuck! Motherfucker! Who are you? Do you know that girl? Evil man! Die, evil man! Stop! Stop! - Stop! - Stop! You're not the traitor we all thought, you're one of us. Hugo trusts you. Stop! Why us? Because you are the plague. Motherfucker! Let go of her! Why did you let her come up here? Don't you want to talk about what happened? No, I don't want to know or to talk about what happened, okay? I want to leave here and forget all of it. I'm staying. Excuse me? Jose and Arantza are missing. What are you going to do, save them? Isa, there are people who do this. They're called the police. - Stick your sermons up your ass. - What do you want? For me to come here, eat this shit and smile? Isa, people are dying. You're getting into some shit that'll ruin our lives. Is that my fault? No, but you knew what was going on and said nothing to me! Look, I don't want to know what happened at that party. Or who that guy you were hugging was, okay? Really, I won't ask you for any explanations. And I'm really sorry about your brother and your friends. But you and I are going home. If we hurry, we can still catch the last plane. I'm staying. It's over. Fuck it. No fucking wedding now. Here he is. Piero Lisardo Mondalvi. Violence, resistence. - Hold on, he's mentally ill. - Yes, he's crazy. "San Clemente Hospital. Director of the center, Hugo..." Lizardo. Piero Lizardo, like Hugo, the director. He had a son who died some months ago in an incident. That's right! The riots by the cruise ship protesters. - They're the same. - They're brothers. No, twins. Today, the protests in front of the seat of the bilateral Summit with France turned into riots all over the city. - At present there are over 50 injured... - Here you are. Among them nine Carabinieri. The protesters aimed to highlight the problem of overdevelopment. DEMONSTRATION AT THE FRANCO-ITALIAN SUMMIT A summit about to be suspended due to the disappearance of tourists... have even requested the suspension of Carnaval. Twins. But who's the craziest of the two? Piero worked there as a security guard. I've been there a lot, in front of the Lido. There are only ruins there. The perfect hiding place. And we're online. Tell La Stampa. The Summit begins in three hours. In three hours it'll all be over. CRUISE SHIPS OUT We're going to be late. Look, look, the dead from the plague. The dirt we're walking on is made of bodies piled up on top of each other for centuries. Jose, Jose, are you alright? What have they done to you, Jose? Take it easy. That's how the video that went viral this morning ends. ABDUCTION OF TOURISTS IN VENICE The two surviving Spanish tourists are recovering in a hotel, waiting to return to their country. As for the facts, the police are investigating the abduction and its link to the homicide that occurred this week.
