[motorcycle engine revving] [narrator] In 1971, a young woman died at the age of 20. She left behind a husband, a two year old daughter and a journal of tape recordings. A journal that told what it was like to be young and a mother and in love and dying. The names of the people in her life have been changed. But we have retained her spirit and many of the actual words from her tapes. [Kate singing] ♪ Country roads, take me home ♪ [chuckling] Boy, I want them to play "Country Roads" at my funeral. Dying is beautiful, even the first time around at the ripe old age of 20. It's not easy most of the time, but there is a real beauty to be found in knowing that your end... is gonna catch up with you faster than you had expected. And that you have to get all your loving and laughing and crying done as soon as you can. I pray that I live long enough to see Jill become a human being. Independent of Sam and me. At least old enough to reason some on her own. Old enough so she'll remember me. I guess I like the idea of cremation for the thought of having my ashes just spread across the mountains.

Well, we're having this thing and we figured you'd never get suspicious if I had to keep going back for my knee. Yeah! [both exclaiming] [Weaver playing frenetic tune on banjo] [laughing] I gotcha.

[both gasping] -All right! -[Kate groaning] [Kate] I was so happy that week and I was just gonna explode. So full of love for my baby and my man [laughing] and those absolutely mind blowing mountains. -There just wasn't room for anything else. -[laughing] There wasn't room for pain or sickness or fear. Life was just too incredibly beautiful. Come here. Oh! When are you gonna get some real hair any how? Oh! Baby. [crying softly] Aw, come on. Let's gather some. You're supposed to have long, silky curls, so I can... -play Alice in Wonderland with you. -[continues crying] Yes, I'll be the White Rabbit, and Daddy'll be Mad Hatter. Come on. I'll get this soap off of ya. And we can get out of the tub, yes we can. -Come on. Yes. -[Jill fussing] -[thudding] -[Kate screaming] Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! -[Kate crying] -What? What ha... Get Jill! No! Get Jill! -[crying] -OK, no, no. [chuckling] Baby, baby. Baby, baby. Why? What happened? Why? What? -What happened? -I don't know. Did you slip? -No, it was my knee. -Was there water on the floor? -Something here fall? What? -It was my knee. -Your knee? Does it hurt? -It was my knee! Does it hurt? It just collapsed. [Sam sighs] OK, that's it! We're going to Riverdale! Right today and we get another doctor. One that's... A good one this time. [Kate] Dr. Colburn's just as good as any doctor. He's a quack! -[Kate] You don't even know him! -What's he done but waste our time? He's done his best. That's why I went to the clinic. To save money. Right, and like all your bargains, it winds up costing us ten times as much. I think you're terrific, too. Weaver had a line on a used bike. Now, we're gonna have to spend every last penny on another stupid doctor. [screaming] I don't enjoy being sick! I'm not doing it on purpose! I'm not doing it to thwart you! I don't enjoy almost killing my baby! Quit blaming me! All I'm saying is that if you would've went to a decent doctor six months ago, you'd be well by now. By waiting six months now, it's gonna take ten times longer to cure and it's gonna take us ten times as much and we can't afford it. Nobody says you have to spend your money on me. No strings, remember? -[Jill continues crying] -Bye, good riddance. Meaning? Leave! Go get your stupid bike! I'll cope! Will you? Maybe you will. Yeah. What am I here for, then? What am I doing? Am I decoration? I know, comic relief. Right? Right. You really want me to leave? Please yourself! Do what you wanna do! Right. Creep! Beep-beep. [horn blaring] Do you need a ride, pretty lady? -[horn continues blaring] -You're late. [horn blaring] Wanna get in then? [horn blaring distantly] [Sam] Where are we going? [Kate] Spokane. For tests. Now he thinks it's a tumor. What's a tumor? It's a mole, it's nothing. [both sighing] [Jill fussing] I gotta be there Monday. Please, Sam. Don't bail out on me now.

You know where Three Forks is? -It's on the Columbia River. -Oh, I know. Well, I left home when I was 14. -Oh, really? -Mm-hmm. I was nervy little brat. -Oh, I know. -[chuckling] [chuckling] Um... -I think I better tell you something. -OK. Um, I think people ought a be totally and utterly honest with each other. Oh, well... If I'm being totally and utterly honest. I want you... something fierce. I'm pregnant. Oh. [sighing] Who was it? Why does everybody always ask that question first? [laughing] It's a really dumb question. -Why don't you ask me if I'm happy? -Was it Weaver? Are you kidding? He's my cousin. And besides, I hate him. It's nobody from around here. Hmm. It's... It's somebody I'm married to but I haven't seen him in months. His name is David and I married him when I was 16 years old. And I guess I did it 'cause I wanted to show my mother. Hmm. And what about the baby? -Oh, well, that's a whole other trip. -Oh. You're gonna have it though. You're gonna keep... Of course, I'm gonna keep it. I wanna be a mother more than anything in the whole wide world. And you can't do that without as kid. [whimpering] [Jill crying] Good morning, mother. -Here she is. -Oh, boy. Sit up there for me, will you? Will you sit up a bit more? There you are. -OK, she has... -What did I do? How do I do it? [nurse] Are you comfortable there? Watch out for the... Make sure you've got your arm under her head. -Oh, Sam. -[nurse] Gorgeous. [Sam] Really? Hold your arm under her head. Hold your arm under her head. How does she know what to do? Should I do that? She's working hard now. She'll fall asleep in a minute and don't let her little nose -be touching something. -OK. -I'll let you two get to know one another. -OK. -Wow. -[both chuckling] She looks... sort of like Adolf Hitler, don't you think? Sam, that's terrible! -You Nazi. -[snickering] Does not. She looks like David. Oh. Well... She's pretty. Yeah, no, well, David... Speaking of David. Uh, they give me the birth certificate. -Gave me... -Sam, put that back on. [laughing] Yeah, well, they gave me the birth certificate to fill it out. And, uh, and under the name, you know, where it said, where it said, "Name of father", I ... Well, I didn't know David's last name, see. So, I ... So, I put Sam Hayden. Is that... Is that... Is that all right? Oh, Sam. Oh, wow. -[laughing] It's... -[chuckling] OK. [machine beeping] Hmm. -Hi, Dr. Wilde. -Hi. Want some tapioca? Looks delicious. [Kate] Come off it! There you go. You kids like it straight from the shoulder, don't you? -Tapioca, straight from the shoulder. -[chuckling] -You know what I mean. -OK. You have something called osteogenic sarcoma. It's a tumor on the bone. Well, some tumors aren't too bad, right? [Dr. Wilde] Right. This one's malignant. We need to stop it immediately. And I mean immediately. Now, I've rearranged about 25 schedules so I can operate tomorrow. You see. Osteogenic sarcoma is a kind of cancer that travels from bone to the lung. If we do not stop it in the bone, we can't stop it in the lung. -Once it gets to the lung, I die, right? -Right. And how do you take a tumor out of the bone? We take off the bone. My leg? You wanna take my leg off? It's the best way to get rid of the cancer. -No! -Kate. It's the best way to stop the cancer. Quickly, cleanly and permanently. Look, why don't you sign these and give them to the nurse? What do they say? That you'll give us permission to operate. I've gotta talk to Sam. I'm not gonna sign any papers saying you can cut my leg off. Did you see him in the hallway? No, I didn't. Well, I've got to talk to him. Why is he never here when I need him? Can I borrow a dime? [Jill crying] -Hi. -It's about time. -Why? -Why weren't you here? -What? -I needed you and you were not here. -Wait a minute! -You're never here when I need you. What are you talking about? I just got here. Would you slow down, please, Kate? Just tell me what's goin' on! Please? -What is going on? Shh! -They wanna amputate my leg. Tomorrow. Oh, come on. Big joke, right, Sam? Let's split. I've gotta think. I wanna go to the mountains. [Kate cooing] Hold on. What do they wanna amputate your leg for? Because it's full of cancer! [sighing] Take it easy but take it. That's one thing my mother taught me to say when you encounter those little daily falls. Take it easy, but take it. [laughing wryly] Take it! [engine starting] [Sam] You know, Dr. Wilde said some pretty heavy things back there. Well, Dr. Wilde is a freak. Yeah, maybe we should get another doctor. I don't wanna talk about it. You know, there's gotta be other kinds of treatment. You know, there's this great cancer clinic in Vancouver. -Vancouver? -Yeah. Couple of hundred miles. What's a couple of hundred miles? Couple of hundred miles? I wanna stay right there. Exactly like this for the rest of my life. [grunting] [breathing heavily] So, I'm happy and... Shut up! [laughing] Want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? I want some peace and quiet. One peace and quiet on rye! [cooing] Oh, no, no, no. OK. That's too much. Beautiful. Oh. She weighs a ton. OK, so we're going tomorrow. -[camera clicking] -To the clinic. Not me. [snickering] [Jill squealing] Peace! Hello. Oh, what's your name? Or that's a multiple choice, you can pick whatever you want. [Sam chuckling] It's David. David? David! That can't be David. He doesn't have four heads and green, scaly skin. -What'd you come up here for? -To see my child. She's not yours. She's mine. Well, come in. Have dinner. Be civilized. Do you know how I found about the baby? Your mother told me about it. It never occurred to her that I didn't know. She's a little dense sometimes. [Jill cooing] I signed the divorce papers. You only have for like a year, haven't you? But I signed 'em before I knew about the child. -[Sam] Jill. -Sam. "The child" this, "the child" that. She's got a name. Her name is Jill. You don't have to tell him. Jill Patricia Hayden. Jill for her... [exclaims] Come here. Jill for her paternal great grandmother. Uh, Patricia for Kate's sister. And Hayden for me. Yeah. You do sort of look like her, you know? Kate said you did when she was born. Oh. Here, you wanna hold her for me? And I'll try to get Kate. [Sam] Now, it ought to be possible, [clears throat] theoretically speaking, at least, for two people to love one another and then not love one another and still converse with each other. I mean, after all, they're still people. They can still talk. Still be honest with one another, huh? [stammers] Deal with the upfront. Forget the hurt. Just like it was another examination to get through. -You're wasting your breath. -No, no, no, my dear! Never let it be said! That a man who quests for love, peace and understanding. ♪ Be it ever so humble ♪ scale-wise speaking that is, quests in vain. -What's he on? -Nothing. -He just gets this way. -Spooky. I like it. Oh, yeah, listen, I noticed when you were driving up that your car was packed. Uh... You going some place. Home and the university. -I talked to a lawyer. -You're into that, huh? What are you studying? Geology. I talked to a lawyer. Not telling me you were pregnant when you filed for divorce is what they call an omission of a material fact. Which means that I don't have to give you the divorce. And I can get custody of the child. Over my dead body. Oh, what do you want her for, anyway? Man, you don't look like the maternal type... I'm not saying I want her, I'm saying I can have her. I see what you meant about this guy. Frankly I don't know why you want custody. I don't know why you didn't get an abortion. All I heard from her for a year and a half is, "I'm trapped, This is a mistake. Let me out. I hate making your bed and ironing your shirts. I hate responsibility. Any and all kinds of responsibility. -I'm not ready." -Stop it. -And here you are, taking care of a house, -Shut up! -A man and his child. What happened? -[pan clattering] -I wear sweatshirts. -I grew up. Yeah, sure. For five minutes. Until some other life style strikes your fancy. That's not really fair. It's not really fair to raise a child on alfalfa sprouts and marijuana. I'm not raising her on alfalfa sprouts and marijuana. I'll give you the divorce, if you'll give me the child. -I'll raise her right. -You'll raise her? -My mother will. You like her. -Your mother will! -She'll raise her right, won't she? -I'm not gonna listen to any more of this. Then you'll have everything you've always wanted. Freedom. A new start! -No responsibilities! -Well, I'll tell you something. Jill needs Kate. And Kate needs Jill and I need both of them. Now. What's it gonna take to make you understand that. Let's go outside. [Kate] David, you're acting like a ten year old! You stay out of this! High Noonsville. Before we punch it out, David. I just think that I should tell you that... People change. The only thing Kate wants out of life now is to be a good mother. Well, "only", I say "only". That's number one. And number two is, is she has cancer. -You serious. -Yeah. How extensive is it? They wanna amputate her leg. Oh, my God. [clearing throat and sighing] What about the baby? What about Jill? Well, they'll cure it if she has Jill, see. They'll have to. She won't let them not. Because Jill's not a burden to her. She's not a restriction on her freedom. Jill's her life. It's yours. Thank you. You're crazy.

I've been sleeping at the foot of your bed ever since you checked in the hospital. -Can't take it. -You can't sleep anywhere else for free. [groaning] I don't-- I don't believe you. What are you gonna be? When you grow up, you fat old thing? Tall blonde and beautiful, huh? Kate, don't let her nurse. Get me a nursing bottle. Why? The doctors in Spokane said it was OK. Because you have radioactive iodine in you from the tests. -Now, take her off that breast... -I don't wanna... -...it can be passed in milk. -...wean her yet. You want me to do it? You want me to do it? I want you to leave. "I need you. Why aren't you ever here when I need you?" Right, sit up and all you have to do is hold her as you would nursing. May I have the bottle? Thank you. All right, give her the bottle and don't upset yourself for her. I can't do it. I don't wanna wean her yet. -You want me to do it? -No. She's used to the breast from you. She might take the bottle better from her father. Try it. He's not her father. He's not my husband. -He's just some creep off the street. -[chuckling] I see. Well, all right then, let me try it. I suppose you haven't discussed your treatment with him either, have you? -I just hang out for laughs. -We noticed. The generally accepted way to treat osteogenic sarcoma is by amputation. You remove the cancerous part. If it hasn't spread to any other parts of the body, it's the best solution. -[Jill fussing] -Yes, come. [Kate] He's not interested. I am too interested. Would you shut up? The scanner showed that it hadn't spread. I think that's amazing considering how long you waited. -You're not cutting off my leg. -May I continue? The other possibility is radiation and chemotherapy. Right, which will make my leg to break and my hair to fall out and diarrhea and nausea. Possibly, but I don't think you can compare losing you hair with losing your leg, Kate. Well, it's a lousy trip either way. So, why don't we just skip the whole thing? That's suicide. All these other horrible things that she's gonna do to me and there's no guarantees. No guarantees but a little more time. A little more time for this one. It's what you wanted, I thought. To be a mother. I don't know what I want any more. Except to be left alone just to figure things out. Do you think this is happening to me because I was born on the 13th? Or because I ran away from home? Do you believe in retribution? Nobody I know believes in... Ugh... I don't wanna be a temporary mother for a year or two. I wanna be a mother until I'm a grandmother. [sighing] And I can't learn to walk on one leg while Jill's learning to walk on two. I won't. It's not fair to Jill. And what does all that mean in practical terms, Kate? It means she wants to wake up tomorrow morning with no cancer. And three legs please. Certainly no less than two. [doctor] Mmm. All right. Then. We will start radiation treatments in the morning. There you go. -OK. -OK. Would you two call a truce if I sent in two dinners? -Yes. -No. I'm not hungry. -[laughing] -You behave yourself. Why is everything all tangled up, all of a sudden? [sighing] I don't know. Well, I love ya. -Did you forget that? -No. It's just that... Come on, say it. Tell me, tell me. I'm scared. Oh... I know. I know you're scared. I am scared, too. Everybody is scared all the time. Inside. Everybody. Always. Well, maybe she's wrong. Maybe there's somebody else. Somewhere else, who can give us a different answer. Radiation. I don't want to be full of radiation. I'll be afraid to touch my child. I'm afraid I'll contaminate her. That's as bad as cutting off my leg. But I don't have the money to go any place else. And you don't have the time. This is the best cancer hospital in the whole northwest. And Dr. Gillman is the head of it. At least, this part of it. She's got to know something. Right? [sighing] We've just gotta trust her, baby. And each other. I don't know, it just seems like... Ninety-nine percent of this whole strange scene is trust.

Hot and cold running water. -Not too many steps. -Ah, baby don't cry. Close enough to the hospital to walk when you're feeling stronger, the whole beautiful world outside your living room door. Uh?

Well, the Christians always used to sing before they were thrown to the lions. You know. It seemed like a good thing to do, in the face of adversity. Adversity, oh, wow. Well, well, you're laughing. That's better than before. I can't keep my food down. I can't sleep. My hair is coming out in the handfuls and you want me to laugh at your sick jokes? I am a sick joke. -Then laugh at yourself. -I can't! It's better than crying. [sniffling] I'm not crying! They can't even find a vein that's any good any more -to put the damn shots in! -[speaking indistinctly] They're going to have to put it in my temple next time. Oh, it's a riot. It's a laugh a minute. I suppose you've just left Jill. Jill, what are you doing? Hi, Mommy. Bad girl! Bad girl! Bad girl! You're a bad girl! [crying] No, Sam. [Sam] Ow. No! [Jill] Daddy. Daddy. -Sam... -I gotta go get Jill. -Talk to me. -In a minute. -[choked up] Sam... -In a minute. -[Kate crying] -Come on, come on, come on. -I'm sorry. -Yeah. Well, why don't we all go to the park or something? It's gonna rain. It's warm outside. The sun is shining. [Jill babbling] Jill? Come give Mommy a kiss. No! Kate, will you come on, please? -I'm not going to that stupid park. -Kate, please. I'm not going to compete with you for my baby. Nobody's competing. She's mine, Sam. Remember? You're stealing her from me. She's the only thing in the world that's altogether mine. I know what you're doing. I know what I'm doing, too. I'm taking care of another man's kid 24 hours a day. That's what I'm doing. You're teaching her to hate me -OK, Mom? -...so that when I die... -Yes. -...she won't be so much trouble. You can marry just any old broad. Any old broad'll be better than Mommy! [crying] -[vehicles rumbling] -[horns blaring] [Kate] I've already made my decision. I'm not going to therapy any more. I hate it. You're just wasting your breath. If you don't exercise that leg every day, you're going to lose the use of it. The radiation weakens the muscles along with the cancer. -Between treatments you've got to be... -It hurts. Of course it hurts. If it hurts too much, take the pain pills. I don't want to take the pain pills any more. They mess up my head. Do you want the use of your leg, Kate? I don't even want to live. [sighing] [both laughing] Oh, you should find yourself a man and have about 200 children. -[laughing] -You'd be world's greatest mother. Wait a minute, wait a minute. -I have 350 kids right here. -[sighing] -And you're my oldest. -And most difficult. -I know. -Right now. Right now. I'll give you Jill. You're kidding. No, I'm not. Take me off everything. The pain pills, the cancer pills, the shots. [sniffling] The radiation, take me off everything. Or take my child. [sighing] I could go do it, maybe, if it didn't mean throwing up three times a day or flushing my hair down the toilet. But I can't go on doing what I'm doing to Sam and Jill. It'll get better, really. -Your system is going to get used to it. -[buzzer buzzing] Sam understands. Jill doesn't. Jill can't. -All she knows is that her mother... -Excuse me. Yes. I'm busy. Can you have them call me back. Yes. All she knows is that her mother is screaming at her 25 hours a day. She never used to cry. [voice breaking] Now she cries all the time. She cries in her sleep. She cries when she wakes up. She chews her fingernails. She has nightmares. And when I come in to see her in the middle of the night, she screams. All I ever really wanted to do was have a child. A girl. And raise her the way I should have been raised. With nothing but love and freedom. No shoes. No clothes. No puritan ethic. No anger. No rules. So that she could... be open to the sun and the snow and the mountains and the rain and just know how to love and it's awful hard when you've never been loved. [sighing] When all you've... When all you've known is people scream at you and... tell you how bad you are. Don't just sit there. Why don't you write some of that down? -Some of what? -What you just said. And more. You could write Jill letters. You know, tell her things... [sighing] that you would while she was growing up. -Oh, sure. -No, really. Really. You could anticipate her questions. You know? Um... What she was going to ask you about when she was six. Things that you'd be telling her then. Nothing. You already now everything when you're six. OK. How about when you're ten or sixteen? I don't know. Well, sure you do. Let's see... Um, what about pimples? -[both laughing] -OK. There you go. There's one. -You know about pimples, right? -Yeah, I know about that. OK and let's see, what else could you tell her about? Boys? Yes, you could tell her about boys and things you like, like trees and grass and mountains, rain. The seasons. Constancy. Oh, there's so many. You can tell her about love. -Why? -So she'd know you. And who you were and how you feel about her. I can't type. -Well, then tape it. -What am I supposed to buy a tape recorder with? Food stamps? No, I can do better for you than that. Well, you certainly know how to change the subject. Well, you've got a life to get through. As well as a death. And I can't do it taking drugs. Let me get the tapes for that. Now, look, Kate. We do have another drug. It's still in experimental stages. I just want to stop taking what I'm taking now. I know. It's been quite successful in preventing secondary cancers in animals. The experiments have been running for two years. -But they're not finished. -Two years? -Is it a depressant? -No. -Does it make you throw up? -It doesn't make monkeys throw up. -Fantastic. -Now wait just a minute. Quite successful means seventy percent. Thirty percent of the animals have already died. -It's no miracle, Kate. -70% is more than half a chance. It's simply a substitute for what you're on now. One that might not give you as much trouble, that's all. It's... It's experimental. It could give you more trouble. It's a long long shot. There are no guarantees. I don't want... I don't want any guarantees. Whose to say you won't get run over by a truck on the way to kindergarten. Or have a man Sam or have a kid like Jill. I don't want any guarantees. When I said two years, that doesn't mean... Kate, listen to me. -It doesn't mean that... -I don't want any guarantees! Two years! I was born lucky. I can write War and Peace in two years. Jill'll be four in two years! I can remember when I was four. I went to the zoo! [chuckling giddily] Kate, please listen to me. Now, I have more to say. Now, wait. Kate, you have to let me finish. Sam? Oh... [exhales] Sam, are you here? Uh... Hello, tape recorder, can you hear me? Come on. Hello, Doctor Gillman. Hello, Jill. Hello, world! Oh... I love you. [over tape recorder] Hello, Doctor Gillman. Hello, Jill. Hello, world! Oh... I love you. [tape recorder clicking] [sighing] [laughing giddily] Sam! Somebody! [sighing] I have so many things to write about. And so many things to say to someone to someone who'll listen, I don't know where to begin. ♪ A C, back to G, G again ♪ ♪ With an F sharp bass To E minor ♪ ♪ C again ♪ -Sam! -Huh? Where's my tape recorder? It's right here, on the-- on the rocking chair. It's absolutely freaky having a thing for a machine but I really love it. [Nora] Anything that makes you as happy as you've been the last couple of weeks, can't be all that bad, Kate. Even if it is a machine. Oh, it's a trip. Definitely a trip. Yeah, an ego trip is what it is. Ego-shmeego, man. Anything that satisfies you is an ego trip. Even dying. -Oh, that's funny. -Oh, Weaver, sit on it. -[crying] -Thanks a lot, cuz. -Hey, Sam? Sam? Can we please rehearse? -Hey, who invited him? -Let them clean up. -Sam, go on, now. I'll do the dishes. -Go on, now. -[Jill wailing] [incoherent chattering] [Weaver singing indistinctly] No! ♪ ...sorrow in your eyes ♪ ♪ The stars are changing quietly ♪ ♪ The night is nearly gone ♪ [Sam] Kate. We got company, Sam. Let's talk about it later. You're not taking your pills. They make me just as sick as the other ones. So, how many did you take? You didn't give your body a chance to get used to 'em. -What did you take? Two or three? -Ten! -Ten? -Ten days. [clattering] -That ought to be enough. -She didn't give the other pills -a chance to work. -They made me dizzy on top of everything else, Sam! Dizzy? What does dizzy got to do with it? I can't take care of Jill. I can't think. I fall down. -I can't work on the book. -[scoffs] That book! That book's more important to you than living? Yes! [muttering indistinctly] Sam. Now, look, if it's right for Kate, it's right. You know, it's really not up to you or me or even her doctor to tell her how to live her life. If it's right for Kate, it's right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, what about me and Jill? No. She's not taking the pills, she's not taking anything. She doesn't even want to come in for the radiation treatments any more. I ... Yeah, no, yeah, man, I know the consequences! I'm the one... Yes. Yes. She knows. We've talked. We've talked and talked until I'm talked out. So, you see, I'm turning it all over to you, now. And... Yeah. You've gotta have time, you're the one who gave her the damn machine... Listen, they've got to give you five minutes sometime during the day for lunch, right? So, just come on over. We'll split a can of spam or something. [Kate] When I started the book, I realized that the length of your life doesn't make the slightest bit of difference. It's the qualify, not the quantify. [sighing] Well, maybe with your drugs I'll be able to live until I'm 360. And maybe without them, OK, I'll die... sooner. Like, tomorrow maybe. A couple of months maybe. Enough time to leave a little book... A part of myself for Jill. Even for Mr. Grouch face. -Here's the little treat I promised you. -Thank you, Sam. -The decision is up to you, Kate. -The decision is not up to her. She's into playing Camille. -[Kate] I'm not. -Can't you see that? I just know the kind of life I wanna live. Yeah, without any regard for anybody else. What do you mean, "Without any regard for anybody else"? Kate, there has to be an understanding that if you give up the drugs and if you give up the radiation treatment you will have absolutely no chance of stopping cancer. And it grows very fast. How fast is very fast? [Sam] How fast is fast? That's not the point. How can you ask that? Didn't you hear her what she said? With medication, you have a chance to live. A chance. A ten to twenty percent chance to live for five years as a vegetable. [Sam] I want you to live! Jill wants you to live! I can't live on medication, Sam. That's what I'm trying to say. So, they're going to find a cure for cancer, right? I mean, thirty years ago you died of diphtheria, pneumonia and polio. Today it's cancer. They're going to find a cure for cancer any day now. [sighing] In zero to five years? It's possible. But the odds? [sighing] I can't take that gamble. -You have to take that gamble. -And die after five years after I've made everybody miserable including myself. What for, Sam? [sighing] How fast will it spread if I don't take the medication? It's impossible for me to predict that. Well, I won't die tomorrow, will I? I mean, I'll have some time before it gets to my lungs. And then some time again before it kills me. And up until then... I'm not going to feel much worse than I feel now, am I? You'll feel much worse at the end. [Kate] But until then... Weaker, perhaps, but not perceptibly. See? That's enough time. Enough time? Enough time? Enough time for what? To be a wife? To be a mother? To... to see the world? To experience everything there is to experience? -"Enough time"? -[Dr. Gillman] Sam. Sixty years isn't enough time for me! Yes, but you don't have a tape recorder. I don't... I don't believe any of this! Sam. It's not quite as cut and dried as you make it out to be. Without medication, she will certainly die. And within a short period of time. With medication she will most likely, also die. But not quite as soon. Osteogenic sarcoma is very rare, And we don't have much of a chance to work with it. And very deadly. So whenever we do have a case, we just don't have much time. -Yeah, well... -Sam, listen to me. And some people react so adversely to medication, that the difference between dying soon and dying sooner, has no meaning to them. -Well, in my opinion... No, you wait-- -Just a minute. Just a minute. -[sighing] -Perhaps it's better to die with purpose and dignify, even if it's sooner. Well... In my opinion, you are committing suicide. And you are a murderer. [door slamming] He loves dramatic exits. Does he do it often? Will he be back? Does it matter? [Kate sighing over recording] Feeling sorry for myself. I like to, sometimes. Like right now, because I'm alone. Because I'm dying. I like being a martyr. -At least it gives me something to b e. -[tape recorder clicks] I love you, Mommy.

That's not the question. Just answer the question. No, if you take the pills, I come back. It's as simple as that. It's easy. Oh, come no now, I don't want to hear any more of this garbage, Kate. Just, will you or won't you, right? Right. OK. Bye. Who was that? Wrong number. -Hi. -Hi. I'll put the rest of these up for you, Doctor. Thank you, Mary. How's Jill? Thriving. Good. Oh, I've got some thing for you. I thought you weren't going to give me these these -unless I went to therapy. -No, I wouldn't do that to you. It looks worse. Yes, Doctor, it does. But the chest X-ray was negative. -It hasn't spread to my lungs. -That's correct. So the fact that the knee's worse isn't really significant, is it? Who are we kidding, me or you? -[Kate] It was worth a try. -[both chuckling] Where is Sam keeping himself these days or don't you know? Sure I know. He's been staying in a place called O'Brien's -on Western and 66th. -Mmm. -But don't waste your time. -Let me take a look at that knee. It's so ugly. I should have had it cut off. You miss Sam much? Jill does. What about you? Yeah. [Dr. Gillman] What days does Sam work at O'Brien's? [Kate] Work? He doesn't work there. He just goes to practice there during the day. -But like I said, don't waste your time. -[Dr. Gillman] Of course not. ♪ To go a little while ♪ ♪ And it's goodbye again ♪ ♪ I'm sorry to be leavin' you ♪ ♪ But goodbye again ♪ ♪ As if you didn't know ♪ ♪ It's goodbye again ♪ ♪And I wish that you could tell me ♪ ♪ Why do we always fight ♪ ♪ When I have to go ♪ -It's very good. -Hi, Doc.

That's what's happening right now. -Right? OK. -Not gonna talk to her? Are you afraid? There's just nothing I really want to talk to you about. That's all. I see. Well, then you're going to have to bear with me. 'Cause there's a few things I want to talk to you about. Your wife. Your responsibilities. Your humanity. Or your lack of it. You're letting her kill herself and you're talking to me about my lack of humanity? Why did you marry her? You knew she had cancer. -Why did you marry her? -He's a little stupid. This is your business? -I loved her. -Well, don't you still love her? I, well... I don't know. I really don't know. [sighs] No, no, he doesn't.

Do you want some of this? -No. But I want her to. I mean, I would. If it was me. Yeah, well, it's not you. It's her. She's dying her way. -And she has a right. -But she's accepted it. She's given up. And she wants my approval for that. And I can't give it to her. I just can't hack that. [chuckling] Wait and see how Ivy grows, Jill. It grows really fast. Let's put it over by the window, OK? It's gonna get lots... Lots of sunshine. It'll be perfect. We can tie it with some string. Right. We can tie it with some string, it'll frame the window and it'll look really pretty. Really leafy. -[Jill babbling] I'm wet, Mommy. -[sighing] Oh, my God, wet pants. Get me some pants, OK? I tried to write a poem for Jill today, But all I could think of was sunshine. Beautiful sunshine. If I had a piano, I could play a lullaby for Jill. A blues lullaby. Hi, Mom. It's Kate... How are you? People have been nice but there isn't anybody I can cry with. Nobody to touch me. Nobody to say it's OK. Is Dad there? Nobody to comfort me and listen to my self-pity. I'm so tied up inside it hurts. [sighing] I wish my sister could come down. You should see her. She's growing like a weed. It's just that if I was a grandmother, I'd take a little more interest in my grandchild. No, I'm not criticizing, Mom. Sam's fine. No, he's not here right now. [sighing] Why? He's rehearsing, I suppose, I really don't know. That's right, Mom. I don't know exactly where he is. OK? Satisfied? Just a couple of weeks. [giggling] He just... He just has a hard time, Mom. With my knee and all, not being able to get a job. [sighing] Mom, if you keep going on like this, I'm just going to hang up. No, I don't need anything. Yes, I do. I need Pat. Will you please send her down here for a weekend? What kind of trouble is she gonna get into, helping me take care of Jill and clean up the house? Never mind, Mom. It's been really great talking to you, I'd forgotten what a sweetheart you are. Yeah. Now, I won't miss you any more. -Hey, too tie. -[giggling] [knocking on door] Who is it? [Sam] Bob Dylan. Hi. Making love to your tape recorder? It's a nice alternative. It doesn't get angry. And it doesn't leave when things get sticky. -It's not bullheaded. It's not stupid. -Wow. I certainly hope that you'll both be very happy together. This guy was hanging around O'Brien's. When the pound came, I told them he was yours. -Came to get all your junk, uh? -Yep. It's a weird time to move, isn't it? Jill's asleep. [Kate] So it's easier. [Sam] A lot easier. I'll shut up, too, if you want me to. Doesn't make much difference one way or the other. No. I'm immune to you. What's the cat's name? Gypsy. Is that symbolic or something? No, it's descriptive. He likes me. He'll stay with me. He's dumb. He might. I miss you and all your snitty remarks. Yes, and I miss you. And your death wish. -[Kate] It's gone. -Sure. Sure. No, really. It really is. It's gone. You gonna take the drugs? Let's go to the mountains. You and me and Jill. It's really nice up there now. I miss talking to you. I miss making love to you, too. But what about the cancer, Kate? Come on. What're we gonna do about the cancer? Live with it. No. You're asking me to watch you die, baby. I can't do that. I need you. I'm begging you. I'm not asking you to die with me, I'm not asking you to stay to the very end. I'm just asking you to live with me. Everybody knows that a cat won't stay in a house where someone's dying. Stay as long as Gypsy stays. [cat purring] OK? Finally. Peace within myself. Summer is over and fall is my time. My poetry. I love it. Virgo in September and changing leaves, falling and cluttering and drifting to the ground. The smell of the sun and the dying grass, the light filtering through the branches. In autumn, the sun is in the peace position. So, it's time for warm sweaters and football and touching and loving. Oh, I love it so much! [laughing] Where the hell have you been? Can you help me get the stuff out of the car, please? -[Kate] Nora! -We had an audition. Remember? I mean, we almost had a job. Except you weren't here. I had to go to the mountains. What do you mean you had to go to the mountains? Without telling anybody? Will you just cool it, Weaver? We just got back. You knew we had an audition, what are you trying to do? You have just become Mr. Irresponsibility and it really is getting me down. -How's the big C coming along, Kate? -Would you cool it, I said! -[Nora] ... be nice! -[Kate] ... better till you got here! Right, you better rush back to the mountains and recuperate from nasty old Weaver. [Sam] You are nasty. -Nora, will you give me the... -I mean, your old man... -...on the table. -...doesn't need to work. Oh, yeah. Sure. And, you know, it's really true. It really is. Nothing is more important to you than dying is. [Nora] There you go. I mean, you don't have hospital bills. Or you don't pay rent. Or buy food. Or gasoline. And Jill never outgrows her shoes. -Jill never wears shoes. -That's funny. -Oh! Let go, Gypsy. -Gypsy. I tell ya, I wish I had parents I could soak. So grand, Weaver. See you later. It's wine time. -Wine? -No, thank you. -Goodbye. -[Nora] Goodbye, Weaver. It's so pathetic, the guys they got. Keith Wilder and Gordon Matthews. You know we're better than they are. I know we would've had the job if we'd only been there. Thank you. If Kate hadn't had to dragged you off... Just... It's my fault. Just leave Kate out of this. -Yeah, well, I've had it. I'm splitting. -Good. -The group. -[Jill] Mommy. I got to make money. -Sam'll do better as a single. -Daddy. -He won't do anything as a single. -That's good, baby. That's very good. You really know how to bring a guy out. You know what I mean, Weaver? I don't know what you need money for. You eat all our food. And drink all our wine. Well, you've wrecked my life. I might as well be into you for something. Why do you think I won't make it as a single? Because he's jealous. He's a nerd and he knows nobody's going to pay any money to see a nerd. [Weaver] I love you, too. No, because you don't work any more, even when we're here, you don't work. Remember the hours we used to put in at the beginning. I mean night after night, all night. It just doesn't mean enough to you. Music doesn't. -That's a dumb lie. -No, it isn't. It's the truth. So, what are you gonna do now on your own? I don't know. I was, uh... I was selling stuff until I ran into you. You know? [sighing] You know, Kate, being at the hospital all the time. You got access. How about it? I mean, being in the family, you know, you owe it to me. That's not really terribly funny, man. Wasn't meant to be terribly funny. Oh... Then you should probably get the hell out of my house. -You talking to me or her? -I'm talking to you, man. You should probably get the hell out of my house. Mmm... Well, I would but I think I'd rather stay and toast to you, John Wayne. [glass shattering] Get the hell our of my house, man. [chuckling] Aw! And don't come back until you're ready to apologize to my wife, pilgrim. Right? That's exactly right, yeah. Don't hold your breath. [motorcycle engine revving] Look out for all that glass there. It's so beautiful with Sam now. It's better than it's ever been. You should hear his music, it's really nice. Mmm. In fact, they had an audition today. He should be here pretty soon. Has he got the adoption papers for Jill yet? No. He hasn't even applied yet. Why? Here it is. -[Kate] How much time does that leave me? -Not much. Well, weeks, months, days? Oh, hi. I'm sorry I'm late, man. I ... I was looking for Gypsy all morning. I didn't even get to the audition. [exhales] The minute you left, she ran away. [panting] What? 'Cause he knew. It's in the lung. [car door buzzing] [buzzing stops] Kate. Kate. [tape recorder clicking] [sighing] [knocking on door] Mmm. -[Sam] Nora. -[knocking continues] Mmm. Come in. Do you leave your door unlocked like this all the time? [Nora] Mmm. -Sam? -Yeah. Is Kate all right? [Sam] Oh, she's fine. She's fine. Uh, she's upstairs asleep. -Oh. Hi. -Hi. Uh, turn the light on. Come on in. Oh, yeah, well, the thing is, is that I wanted to... I had to have somebody to talk to. See? So, um, the reason is that... We got the job. [laughing] We got the mother loving job at O'Brien's. So, we start tomorrow night. Two nights a week at O'Brien's. Oh, Sam, that's so great. Hand me that shawl over there, off the horse? -Yeah. -[Nora] So, tell me. Uh, yeah, it was Weaver. All this time, I thought Weaver had gone home. But all that time, he's talkin' to 'em at O'Brien's about a real job. And they hire us. They actually hire us. Yeah. -Congratulations. -Yeah, God. O'Brien's. Have you any idea who started at O'Brien's? -No. -Neither have I. [both laughing] Oh, no. It's horse riding. It's Hayden in the stretch.

Someone's calling you. -[Jill] Daddy? -The answer obviously is no. Absolutely, categorically, no. [sighing] Sam, it's OK. It doesn't matter. [door slamming] Babysitter. [whistling] Nora.

The door was open. -And I always lock the door. -Oh, Sam. [sighing] ...two, three, four. Is everyone ready now? Jack, are you ready? [Jack] We're ready. We're rolling. Kate, eighth interview at her apartment. [man 1 ] By now, everyone knows Kate Hayden. Knows what she's been through. What's happened to her, what happened to her tapes of the hospital. Uh, could we hold it? Wait. Wait just a minute, please. Mrs. Hayden, do you think we could bring the child in here with you? Jill? come here. -[Jill grunting] -[man 1 ] Beautiful. That's it exactly. Well, I stopped... I stopped taking drugs or anything be... or anything else for the cancer because, um... they messed my head up and I couldn't say what I wanted to say and I couldn't leave the book I wanted to leave her. So they expect me to die pretty, pretty soon. And that's really hard to say, 'cause all of a sudden, there's nothing left for her. I don't suppose whoever, uh, took my tapes and tape recorders... [chuckling] Recorder, um... is watching, but if you are, please, um, please send me back the used tapes. They aren't any good to you anyway. Mrs. Hayden, the station has authorized me to present you with this new tape recorder -and one dozen reels of tape. -Thank you. Jill... If you ever feel the need to talk to someone, baby, -come to this book. -More mail! -Are you ready for this? -Written words can't help much, -[exhaling] -but at least it'll let you know how much I would've cared. For whatever was wrong. I love you so much, baby. -[telephone ringing] -I got it. Hello? No, no. This is a friend of hers, can I help you? I wish I could be with you when you're old enough to read this. No, she can't be at the phone right now, can I take a message? I wonder what the world's gonna be like then. [Nora] She's in the bathroom. -Yes. Papaya juice? -[Kate continues speaking indistinctly] Yes, I've got that. OK. Yeah, I'll make sure she gets it. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. This one says papaya juice, beet root, soybean oil in a blender. Six times a day for six weeks. [scoffing] People. God bless 'em. Please remember that sex is a function, and love is an emotion. Don't just sleep with any man for sex. Because when you're in love, there's a bond of giving and receiving. It's so important, Jill. If any sort of relationship is gonna survive. Well, East Germany's got the cure today. Tomorrow I suppose it's gonna be Red China, right? -Well, listen to this. -Hmm. What? "God has a reason for everything, Mrs. Hayden. Search your soul, find your sin. For you have indeed committed a terrible..." I'm going to miss you, Sam. The way you touch me and comfort me when I'm sad. And the way you smile. And the way you dance around when you're happy. I can't die and leave you guys. Who's going to clean the toilet? Who's going to clean the oven? What's the matter with you, God? My family's not a bunch of Boy Scouts who can figure out all these things for themselves. That's what you taught me to do. That's why I'm here. God, you're some kind of idiot! To pull something like this. [sniffling] What do you gain? I just don't understand. [sighing] Jill is a beautiful little girl who needs a mother to love her. I feel like it, right now, like death. I get so close at night. [breathing raggedly] Are you all right, Mommy? [gasping loudly] What? Where is it? What? What? You can't breathe? You can't breathe? [Kate coughing and spluttering] [Kate laughing softly] My mother took us to the Seattle zoo. And we were feeding the elephants, Pat and I. We ran out of peanuts and popcorn and they were still hungry so I grabbed my white sandals off my feet and threw them in. [sighing] Pat thought it was a great idea and started to take all her clothes off and throw them but Mom stopped her. Oh, I hated those stupid sandals anyway. [Kate sighing] Around Christmas time we used to collect pine cones for an old lady. I think it was, uh... I think it was Mrs. Seewald, Mrs. Seewald, who made wreaths for the church. She died before I was ten. ♪ I remember being with you ♪ ♪ I remember dreaming with you ♪ ♪ I remember loving you ♪ ♪ You were mine ♪ ♪ And now the day seemed so long ♪ ♪ Mmm ♪ ♪ And I can't face the night alone ♪ ♪ I beg you, please ♪ ♪ Won't you please come home? ♪ Sam? Hey! Hi. Hi, sweet lady. How do you feel? Nothing hurts any more. [Kate] It's heaven to breathe without it hurting. [sighing] In that case. I brought my competition. Sam. [Kate sighing] I wish I had a piano. So, I could play Jill a lullaby. A blues lullaby. How I wish I were up in the mountains. [exhaling] I hope you put me there. Sam? It's me, baby. -Where's Sam? -He had to go work. -And Jill's with the people upstairs. -I keep dreaming about her. Oh, Kate. Hey. Don't worry about Jill. She's gonna be just fine. You know, she's a tough little girl. I worry about her all the time. There's no need to. There's lots of people that love her and would take care of her. -Think they'll put her in an orphanage? -No. Now, why would they want to do a thing like that? And Sam, Sam's not gonna... [scoffing] Abandon her? I don't know. She's not really his. Why should he be saddled with her for the rest of his life. After all this crud with me. [chuckling] Oh, it's enough. When I go he ought to just be able to walk away. If he does, I'll take Jill. If you want me to. Well, it's between you and Dr. Gillman. -She's so busy all the time. -[laughing] -So I win by default, right? -[Kate] You know what I mean. [chuckling] Kate... Kate, I'd raise her real right, anyway. Sam's parents are going to try to get her. Or my parents. And I don't want them to have her. It's really important to me. You know, I don't know anything about any legal stuff... But, you know... Maybe if you put it down on a tape, then if there's any hassle, then it won't be my word against theirs. What is it about me that bothers you, Kate? -You're untidy. -[Nora chuckling] Yeah, I'm untidy. But tidy mothers raise neurotic daughters. Yes. My mother was tidy. You've been sleeping with Sam. Not any more. It wasn't such a terrible thing to do under the circumstances, was it? [Kate] No, I guess not. It's just that I don't want Jill... Raised by a loose woman? -[chuckling] Loose and untidy. -[both laughing] That's so stuffy and middle class of you, my dear. -Sorry. -No. I meant to put all the things I made for Jill in a cedar chest. -The quilt and things. -[Sam] Yeah, I know. I'll do that. -And if the tapes ever turn up... -[Sam] I'll have them typed and bound. But you almost have everything re-recorded anyway, don't you? -Well, I don't know. I'm so disorganized. -Oh, no, you're not. Dying's such a hassle. No, but you don't have to worry about anything, just leave everything to me and... and I'll sort it all out just the way you want it. -You wanna... -Call Dr. Gillman. Why? Don't... Can I get you anything? You want pain pills? [rattling] -There's... -Sam. What? Wait. Please. You fade away and come back. Like some artsy-craftsy movie. And so do the walls. [sighing] Bring your piano. [stammering indistinctly] Please. -Just wait a bit please. -Oh. About Jill. All right. I'm gonna to take care of Jill. I told you that before. Kate, I love Jill. I hope you marry Nora. I just... I just wanna be married to you. Why are you always trying to pawn me off on somebody else. All we gotta do is... Just get a little rest. And get you better and then we'll all go home together. Nora's good with Jill. [chuckling] Would you cut it out with this Nora stuff? If I can accept dying, why can't anybody else? [Dr. Gillman] Hello, Kate. [Kate] If you ask me how I'm feeling I'll strangle you. [Dr. Gillman] What do you want for lunch, that's all I want to know. -[Kate] A pain pill. -[Gillman] OK. And you won't give me any other drugs to prolong it. Promise? [Dr. Gillman] Promise. I've got-- got some stuff to do in the book. And I can't do it with that stuff that messes my head up. [Dr. Gillman] Whenever you do want a pain pill, all you have to do is ring for the nurse and she'll bring you one, OK? And you're not going to put any other stuff -in the pain pills, are you? -No, of course not. I wanna die on my own clock. That's what I want. OK, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't take this. I ... [sighing] What'd I tell you? Mr. Vanishing Act. [laughing] [chuckling] Well... It's hard to watch somebody die. Probably harder than it is to die. [engine starting] [Kate] What am I thinking about? Oh... About friends and places and dogs I've had. Thinking about my little girl. Kind of stubby. Long blond hair. With an attitude about life that makes me feel small. Thinking about dying. Feeling rage that soon there won't be no more of me. But a feeling of melancholy comes, you know? It's really a beautiful feeling. When you know you've done all you know how to do and all that's left is a little bit of tomorrow. I was a virgin when I married David. Can you believe that? All the things she accused me of. [sniffling] I loved my keeping myself a virgin because I loved her. Because I believed her. Even when she stopped believing me, I went on believing her. She taught me what... She taught me what love was when she taught me the names of the mountain flowers. [Dr. Gillman] Yeah? And to speak out for myself. And she gave me my first dog. [chuckling] [voice breaking] How could she accuse me of being a tramp? Mommy... [crying] Please, Mommy. Tell me you love me. Because I hurt so bad and I need my mommy to comfort me. [sniffling] I know, Kate. I'll tell her. Tell her nothing. Tell her to go to hell! It's hard now. Very hard. I keep thinking let me wake up just one more morning. I have so much to say to Jill. It's so important. Or is it so important? I don't even know how to play the piano. Goodbye, Jill. Goodbye, Dr. Gillman. Goodbye, Sam. Jill, my love. My little love. Hang in there, baby. Hi, Daddy! She died. Didn't she? I want my... [exhales] I drove this thing 425 miles already. Huh. Jill. Wanna go for a ride? Huh? Huh? -Here's a flower for you! -Oh, thanks, baby. Thanks. Let me unbutton my coat. Look out, it's bur-- It's hot. Yeah. Yeah, OK. I'll just put this coat around here. I'll button you in, can you breathe? huh? OK, ready to go? Look out. Yeah, OK. ♪ Lady, my sweet lady ♪ ♪ I'm as close as I can be ♪ ♪ And I swear to you ♪ ♪ Our time has just begun ♪
