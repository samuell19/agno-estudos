Give me a two-shot. I just feel as if everything is out of my control. Do you know what did it? We say it's the only way to look terrific. - He understands all about the Gift. - The recent string of fatal attacks... This next one coming up was in the park. It's the second victim. It's bad enough with a psycho picture... She's ours. With this build-up, the public is dying to see her. - Killing ground... - It's real. Push in to a single of the doctor. Dr George Waggner explains on a special edition of Perspective. I saw pictures just like we saw in his room. It's a rare thing. I have something for you. It is, after all, what we are. Repression. Repression is the father of neurosis, of self-hatred. Stress results when we fight against our impulses. We've all heard people talk about animal magnetism, the natural man, the noble savage, as if we'd lost something valuable in our long evolution into civilised human beings. There's a good reason for this. Man is a combination... Camera two. ...of the sophisticated and the primitive. We should never try to deny the beast, the animal within us. - When something breaks, cut to Chris. - Before Doc pitches his book. He's been coaching Karen on how to talk to this psycho. How much? Eddie? John. How much for a happy hand? Sorry, buddy, excuse me. Excuse me. - You're that TV lady, ain't you? - Yeah, buzz off. Jesus. - Did Karen see this? - Yeah. Shit. She never mentioned seeing the victims. She didn't want you to worry. I'm worried. OK, guys, this is the jackpot. I'm on Western, between... - Don't like that interference. - It's the best rig we've got. All that neon messes up the signal. I'll get our people to cruise Western. Lot of flotsam and jetsam out tonight. There's more every time we get out here. I wonder where they come from. I wonder where they're going to. Well, they got to where they're going. 6 Data Jail 1455, contact Fox One. Report any sighting. If she's wearing a purple outfit, we should be able to spot her. I've seen her on the news. When news reporter Karen White began receiving calls from a stranger identifying himself only as Eddie, the KDHB news team... No. The KDHB news team began working... The KDHB news team began working with local police to link Eddie with a recent string of... Hi, Bill. That's a... That's a brave little girl you've got there. Tonight. An act of courage we here at KDHB are all very proud of... - Good evening. - Terry, how are you? - How's it going? - Just a few more minutes. There's a guy outside the booth and I don't know if it's him. Lieutenant Shantz, Detective Kline, this is Karen's husband. You've got a brave lady, Mr White. Neill. Bill Neill. My wife uses her maiden name. Bill Neill. Stanford, right? How is it going? I haven't got a clean word from Karen in the last 15 minutes. Hello? Hold it, she's transmitting! Yeah, I'm alone. Are you wearing what I asked you to? Good. Where's the sound? That's it. We might have lost her. Lost her? What the hell kind of half-assed operation is this? OK. OK, Eddie, I'll be there in just a little while. OK, mister, it's all yours. What kind of operation are you running here? - They have people in the area... - What does that mean? They will find her! OK, guys, this is it. I'll keep the transmitter open. Hello, Eddie. I knew you'd come, Karen. We have a lot to talk about, you and me. Can I turn around and see you? Not yet, Karen. Just watch. - Yeah, she asked me directions. - How long ago? A couple of minutes. - The struggle... - Give me a two-shot. Take it. Three, when he picks the book up, give me a close-up. Two, push in to a single of the doctor. - Untapped potential for living... - Put his key in. Waiting's tough. 21, take one. Go on, you look a little tired. Each of us is given a gift. The gift of life. Give me a two-shot. She didn't feel a thing. None of them do. They're not real, the people here, they're dead. They could never be like me. But you're different, Karen. I watch you on TV. I know how good I can make you feel. I'm gonna light up your whole body. Turn around now, Karen. I wanna give you something. Yeah, there's a broad that came in here. She emptied the place out. She's watching movies. Oh, my God, Jesus Christ. Put your piece away. Put that piece away! I knew I shouldn't have let that broad back here. Better remote, take it. Just down here? A reign of urban terror ended tonight in a bizarre shoot-out... No knife, no gun. The freak was clean. What happened back there? Don't ask me, ask Quick Draw McGraw here. Died in an attempted assault of anchor woman Karen White, who'd received calls from him in connection with brutal murders in the downtown area. Karen, are you all right? OK, baby, sit here. They say we can go home in a few minutes. I talked the old man out of putting you on camera. We'll tape something later on when you feel up to it. I don't know. Whatever happened in your own words, nothing newsy. I don't know what happened in there. I don't remember. Please don't do it! Please don't do it! It's me, it's Bill. It's all right. I didn't see him. I turned around but I didn't see him. - It's number 27, down the hall. - Thank you. Did the guy say anything else? Just that he thought the kid lived here. - He said the kid hated washing dishes. - Who doesn't? Here we go. Charming. Just your average red-blooded all-American boy. Get out of here! Doc's gonna have a field day with these. Karen. Look at this. Not bad. The kid had talent. Could have designed the Marquis de Sade colouring book. I think we'd better call the cops. Eventually. Look at this. I wonder if this is a real place. What's the story on our next Norman Rockwell? This sort of person is controlled by the right hemisphere of the brain. That dominates the nonrational, the artistic, the creative impulses. It's not unusual for a killer to draw as well as that. Would you mind putting that on tape for us? Not at all. We're hoping for a half-hour special about Eddie Quiet, although we're focusing on the beast in all of us. Good idea. You found the last name? He signed his work. So he did. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just not quite ready yet. OK? It'll be OK. Don't worry. Stand by, cameras one and two. Two, push on in. - Are you up to this? - Nothing like diving in head first. - That's what the old man says. - I bet he did. - Here's our girl. - Hi, Fred. We're gonna make ratings history. You'll be the centre show. - What's that? - Everybody will be watching to see the lady who caught Eddie the Mangler. Terrific. You have my copy? Good luck. - She seems shaky. - Looked fine to me. We go in ten seconds. Five, four, three... This is KDHB TV, Channel 6, Los Angeles. Up on two. It's the five o'clock edition of the Southland's top-rated newscast. Go to camera two. - Are the tapes are in? - Yeah. 14 injured in train derailment. I got a letter from a right-wing viewer who thinks I'm a communist. Now here's Karen White. Good evening. Get off her. Get her out of there. Roll seven. Put her on eight. ...no immediate danger to nearby residential areas. Let's pause for an editorial from our general manager, Fred W Francis. - Sorry, it's just my head... - You just need a little more time. There's been a lot of talk about our culture of violence. Maybe she's pregnant. Get in touch with that Fujiyama-Fujimoto girl for the 11-o'clock report. Now, there is a pro. You can't be afraid of dreams. I can't help it. All I remember is... pushing open the door... and then I'm outside. The police are there and Bill's there and the remote crew, and it's over. There's blood on me and I don't know who it might have come from. You can't remember anything that happened in the booth? Not really, just weird little pieces in my dreams. How are you and Bill? Trying to communicate. Tell me, Doctor, how crazy am I? - Completely bananas. - I think so. I recommend that you go up to The Colony for a week or two. - Your place up north? - That's right. I only recommend it to special patients who I think will benefit from its environment. You can recharge your batteries. It'll enable you to try and get back to what you really are. What goes on up there? Seminars, group therapies - very low-key. It'll be a good place to try and tackle this amnesia thing. I don't know if I want to remember. What? Doc said that once I remembered it, it wouldn't scare me. I'm not so sure. Honey, give this place a chance. We've got to do something. I hope these people aren't too weird. Hi! Jerry Warren - Softwares. Hi, Bill Neill - hardware. - Hardware? - He doesn't get it, Bill. I own health clubs - barbells, hardware. This is my wife Karen. Nice to meet you. Prime rib? - No, I try to stay away from meat. - Maybe later. Thank you! Did you see that meat? Karen White! Oh, my God. We watch you on the news all the time. You're our second favourite behind... What's the name of that Oriental girl? This is my wife, Donna. Get me out of here, Bill. Lookee here! Welcome to The Colony. Charlie Barton, Bill and Karen... - White. - Neill. Charlie's on the board. He put up the cattle for the barbecue. I seen you on television! Thank you. I think I'll borrow Karen and give her the run-down on The Colony. - Don't leave out the juicy stuff. - I won't. - Let's get this boy some bacon. - You say when, Bill. Can't go on like this. Damn teeth are shot. Hell of a goat. Do you want some? Yeah, sure, why not? What's in it? It's good. I'm Bill. I know. I'm looking for my wife. Why? Excuse me. Just letting it all out. I've felt parts of me, I didn't even know existed. Now you can see why I brought you here. You won't be cold. How is your bungalow? - It's quite nice, thank you. - We're neighbours. Tell me something else - do you miss the television? Are you kidding? I don't have to pin my hair up. Waggner! Hello, Marsha. How are you? Take this book back. I don't want my brother reading it. I think he said he'd like to. You've done enough damage already. Bitch. We can all learn a lot from Marsha. She's a very elemental person. It's all that natural energy. She's a nymphomaniac. It's just that it's so unchannelled. She has a long way to go. Let me go, I wanna end it. - Easy, buddy, calm down. - It's the only way. I've gotta burn. Calm down. Think a minute. You've gotta let me do it, Doc. -Jesus! - Don't worry. That's one of Erle's favourite tricks. He just wants attention. I wanna end it. It just goes on and on. You know better than that. He shouldn't drink. He gets the blues. Tomorrow, people will be so pleased to see that you're safe and sound. They won't think anything more of it. Get a good night's sleep and everything will seem better in the light of day. There, now. Bill. Wake up! There's something out there. Something was howling. - Listen. - The wind. There was something howling before. Sure, somebody's dog. Not like any dog I ever heard. Honey, you were raised in LA, this is the country. Come on, let's get some sleep. OK? Good. You heard something - why shouldn't you call the police? I'm embarrassed. I wish we hadn't called. Look, all the balls on my side of the court again. What you ladies need is a good retriever. Hiya, Sam. Doc said that you folks had a coyote problem out here. You're famous, ain't you? - Sort of. - Karen White, Sam Newfield. Hi, nice to meet you. I used to watch you all the time. You're prettier than Walter Cronkite. Karen thought she saw something moving in the bushes last night. Coyotes come in to setups like this, looking for garbage. - Did you hear anything? - Me? I sleep like the dead. Tattoo? I don't remember one on him when he came in. The coroner said he had some kind of animal head on his shoulder. I don't get many of you TV people. Mostly it's newspaper guys who come to look at the meat. How can you stand it? Doesn't bother me. Unwrap him, Ross. Let's see. Quiet is still with the John Does. We haven't had time to refile him. What freaked me out was the night old Stu Walker came in. He worked here. We said good night and after a few hours we got a delivery call. Unzipped the bag, there's Stu, smiling up at me, leaking sea water out his ears. Visitors, Eddie! Where is he? He was here this morning. God, look at the door! Do you think he was stolen? He didn't get up and walk out on his own. Are there cows around here? Charlie Barton's got a couple of acres of pasture down the hill. They don't sound right. How are cows supposed to sound? Not like that. Jerry's got a rifle, doesn't he? Haven't you ever done assertiveness training? Before I hooked into Doc, I did it all. I did est, TM, Scientology, iridology, primal screamers... I don't know. I figure, another five years of hard work, maybe I'll be a human being. I don't see nothing. I didn't hear anything funny anyway. - Jesus! - Christ. - Now what? - What's wrong? — Great! - What's wrong? Let me look at it. Let me see. I can tell that's... God, Donna! We're stuck out here in the middle of Timbuktu some place. Watch that gun. Sorry, thought you was a cow-jacker. There's another one up yonder. - You know what did it? - It ain't a coyote. - You girls all right? - Oh, yeah! Nothing like a quiet week in the country. A little straighter. All right. A quick shot again. Think fast. You have potential, Bill. I think you're ready for your bullets. Don't you use dogs when you hunt? Usually, but these clowns shoot 'em. Besides, who needs dogs? We've got TC. That boy's part bloodhound. I still think it was UFOs - them cattle mutilations. Good, Erle. You watch the skies for us, that'll be your job. - I wanna talk to you. - I thought you had a session. I do but I don't want you to do this for my sake. Are you kidding? Besides, I've never been on a wolf hunt before. - This is not a coot shoot. - The boys are calling me. Did you see the boys? What happened then? I hear something else. Somebody else's breathing is in there with me. It's Eddie, and he closes the door. Then he puts a quarter into the slot and the movie starts. Then he whispers something to me. He whispers and then tells me I can turn around and look at him. Turn around. What do you see? What's there? - What do you see? - What's there? - I can't see him. - Just try. He's right there. - What do you see? - What's there? I can't see him! I can't see him. OK, that's far enough for now. I'm sorry. I got it. First shot. And he said he wasn't no hunter. We get them all. Sun worshippers, moon worshippers, Satanists. The Manson people used to shoplift here. Deadbeats. You know of any groups that are into stealing corpses? Body snatching? If you want to read about it, I got a book. Slide me down. That's it. You name it, I got the book. "A number of women were killed the next month. "They exhibited signs of animal attack." What's that? Warlocks, Werewolves And Demons. You gonna purchase? If not, leave 'em, you'll get 'em greasy. We'll find out if the killings were on a full moon. That's Hollywood baloney. Your classic werewolf can change shape at will. That's why they call them shapeshifters. I got books on it. What about silver bullets? Silver bullets or fire, only way to get rid of them. Worse than cockroaches. They come back if you don't kill 'em right, plus they regenerate. Cut off limbs, knife in their heart - in three days, they're as good as new. You believe this? Am I an idiot? I'm making a buck here. I got chicken blood, dog embryos, black candles. Silver bullets. Some joker ordered them. Never picked them up. I take Bank America, American Express, Visa. You buying? These two. - Some incredible old pictures. - That's a good book. You see any wolves? No. Just lots of rabbits. - What do you do with these things? - Eat 'em. My sister'll cook it for you if you want. I try to stay away from meat. Your wife might like it. You kill something you don't eat, that's a sin. I never thought of it like that. The place is just there. My sister'd be glad to cook it for you. - Are you sure? - My sister just loves to cook. Are you sure? How long will it take? I'll cook it later. Karen. It happened so fast I didn't even see what it was. Is that necessary? Can't take any chances. God! I wanna go home. I wouldn't advise travelling right now. A bite like that can be pretty serious. - That's the sign of a werewolf. - That's just a legend. Legends have some basis in fact. An ancient explanation of our dual personality. How does it go? Even a man who is pure in heart who says his prayers, by night may become a wolf when the wolfsbane blooms and the moon is bright. You're reading, I'll get it. — Who's calling you at 11 :30? - It's my phone, I'll get it. - I'll get it. - I'll get it! You get it! Hello? Karen! No, we're still up. What? You're kidding. No, listen, we'll come right up. We'll be right up. Calm down. OK. OK, bye-bye. - What is it? - Bill just got bitten by a wolf. Whoever is bitten by a werewolf and lives, becomes a werewolf himself. Terry, it's only a movie. You go, I'll come when I've pitched the special to the old man. It was probably just some stray dog. Hello, good friend. - How are you? - You OK? I don't know what her last name is. Donna calls her Marsha the man-eater. And she lives in this shack. Furry animals hanging from the rafters. She's trying to make the move on Bill? I don't know. It's just a feeling. I sound paranoid, don't I? Karen, you sound fine. I got no veggies, I totally forgot about Bill and this dinner. Bill! Bill, I'm sorry, I totally forgot about you not eating meat. No sweat, it's terrific. I get hungry enough, I'll eat anything. Hello. Give me this book here. I just thought maybe we'd... Your timing is incredible. Sorry, honey, those shots were... We're just out of sync. We never want the same thing at the same time. Good night, Bill. Screw you, then. Jesus. It's Eddie. Terry. Over here, Terry. Hello? Anybody here? Come on, Christopher! Christopher? You're not gonna believe this! I'm in the bathroom. I had that dream again. This time, I think you were in it. No wonder. You've been asleep all day. Where'd you get those scratches on your back? Guess they're from the other night when I got attacked. They weren't there the other night. You're really getting paranoid. - You've been with Marsha. - Don't lay your fantasies out on me! - I'm not gonna take that. - I know, it's a big conspiracy... You don't have one inch of backbone. She walks by like a bitch in heat... Don't touch me! I'm gonna go to Doc's and call Chris, he'll pick Terry and me up, you can do what you want. - You don't know what it's like. - I don't wanna know. Eddie Quiet, he lives... You're not making sense. Eddie Quiet is dead. I saw pictures, just like we saw in his room. Christopher, the landscape. It's here, at The Colony. It's real! - Are you at Doc's? - Yeah. Christopher, I'll tell you something. I think he's got to be a part of this. Is there some kind of file cabinet there? Are you sure you're all right? I'm OK. Sure is good to hear your voice! Look in the files under Quiet. OK. You're not gonna hang up, are you? I'll get the police there. Just go look in the file. Hold on. Never mind, you're coming with me. Quiet, Marsha... Quiet, TC. It's Eddie... Chris! Operator, get me the Sheriff's Department. No, don't bother. I'll get the State boys and we'll meet you over at the centre. Don't worry, Mr Howard, I'm sure she's safe. Those are real silver. I gotta find out what to charge! Bill me! Crazy fuck. I gotta use your phone... Jesus Christ, what happened in here? Hello, Karen. I'm glad you came. I wanted to see you again. I saw you die. You said on the phone that you wanted to get to know me. But here I am. Look at me. I wanna give you a piece of my mind. I trusted you, Karen... Take it easy, pal. Some of us have to work for a living. This is an emergency! Come on out of there, now, miss. We've been waiting for you. Took some persuading, did she? Karen, no. - Where's Bill? - He's one of us now. In time, he would've brought you over to us. It's wonderful. When I was first bitten, I fought against it. So did Jerry. Then we found the Doctor. He helped us to adjust. You see, he understands all about the Gift. He knows how to use it, how to control it. You could have Bill back if you accept the Gift. - It was a mistake to bring her here. - We shoulda kept the old ways. Raising cattle for feed - where's the life in that? The humans are our cattle. They're our prey! We should feed on them like we've always done. Screw all this channel-your-energies crap. But the danger of exposure! We need this shelter to plan, to catch up with society! Times have changed and we haven't, not enough. Shut up, Doc. You wouldn't listen to me! None of you! "We can fit in," you said. "We can live with them." You make me sick! - Marsha. - You're through, Doc. She's ours now. See what your friend did to me? Isn't that nice? Have you all forgotten everything you've learned? She can't disappear, she's well known. - He's right, Marsha. - I won't let you do this. You can't tame what's meant to be wild, Doc. It ain't natural. Violence is part of the human condition, as history shows us. Coping with that fact, living with it, presents each of us with moral choices. Fortunately, most of us can deal constructively with those choices. For others, the animal lure of mayhem, the physical sensation of life-and-death struggle produces gratification. According to the autopsies, Eddie's victims were bitten, as if they'd been attacked by an animal. What do you know about lycanthropy? - Where did you learn that term? - On the Late Late Show. There are dozens of cases. People walk about on all fours, make bestial groans, they prefer to eat raw meat. It's a coincidence, Karen being attacked by someone like that... You're not gonna believe this. I've been attacked by... Hello, bright boy. You know me, and I don't know you. Why is that? Where is she? - Why? Was she your girlfriend? - Where's Terry? Just down the Ritual Center, down the path. That's where Waggner sends us to unwind. - He's so repressed. - What did you do to her? She's got a sexy voice. I like a woman with a sexy voice. Listen to this part. You are crazy. I'm much more than that, bright boy. Much more. Here... take it. Call it a gift. Come on. Come on, bright boy. Don't you know anything? Put her and her friend in the car, set fire to them and push them off the coast road. Christopher, they'll kill you! That gun won't do you any good. Don't come any closer. - I have silver bullets in here. - Silver bullets, my ass. Get up. They're real. Don't come any closer, Doc. Please. Thank God. Karen, get the door! Come on! - Is that the only door? - Yeah, I think so. - Where's Terry? - They killed her. Take this. Get it started! - How did you find out? - Terry called... Stop! It's Sam. Duck! Chris! I smell gas! Come on! Give it to me! Come on! Lock the door! We have to warn people, Chris. We have to make them believe. I'm an artist. You look terrific! I know you are. Thanks. If you're done, Fran, thanks a lot. - I'm not sure I can go through with this. - You have to. Stand by on set. Five, four, three, two... Good evening. More on that fire that's burning out of control tonight. Firefighters have discovered the blaze started at The Colony, an experimental living community founded by Dr George Waggner. - She's ready. - She look all right to you? Reports indicate bodies have been found inside and outside The Colony building, many burned beyond recognition in what authorities are calling a Guyana-like spectacle. Now for an eyewitness report on the incident, we welcome back... If she shows any sign of freezing, go right to commercials. Good evening. From the day we are born, there is a battle we must fight. A struggle between what is kind in our natures and what is cruel and violent. What the hell is this? This is our birth right as human beings and the real gift that differentiates us from the animals. It is as natural to us as the air we breathe. Did you pass this? She's not reading from the prompter. We changed it a little. But now for some of us, that choice has been taken away. A secret society exists and is living among all of us. They are neither people nor animals, but something in between, monstrous mutations whose violent natures must be satisfied. I know what you're thinking. I've been where you are... - That's enough. - Leave it. - Leave it? Cut! - Leave it! But I have proof and... Tonight I'm gonna show you something... to make you believe... Holy shit! - What is this? - What are you kids watching? The newslady's turned into a werewolf! On, boy. The woman's turned into a werewolf! Switch, dammit, switch! Doesn't that look good? Tender meaty chunks of tantalising nutrition. The things they do with special effects these days. Did you see the guy in space? It was real. She turned into a werewolf and they shot her. You're plastered! Doesn't mean it wasn't real. Ernie, put a steak on for me. Hamburger for the lady. - How do ya want that? - How do you want it, honey? Rare. Go now and heaven help you.
