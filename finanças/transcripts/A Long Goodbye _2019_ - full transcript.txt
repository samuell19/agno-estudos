Little girl, how old are you? She's three. We'll find a way, okay? I heard this is scary. Let's go. "A long goodbye" hello. "Fall 2007" this is fumi higashi. Please leave your name and message. My name is... this is mom. I'm continuing my previous message. Fumi, you have to come home. But no need to bring a gift. Just be here, okay? I think your dad wants to talk to you two about money... Not again. - "Fumi's cell / mari" - 0-8~0~5~9-6+8 Thank you. Ketchup? It'll ruin the flavor. It's good as it is. I always wanted to eat it with ketchup. Let me eat my "last supper" however I want.

Seems like your wife still has a little ways to go with her english... No, really, she's doing great. Getting very good at saying, "I can't speak english" Hello? Hello? Um... - Bye. - Grandma? Takashi? You surprised me. Your english is so good. I only said "hello." Excellent pronunciation. Is your mom home? Yeah. Hold on. Hello? Mari? How are you? Your dad's birthday? Next Friday. Mom insists that I be there. They want to tell me something but not over the phone. What about? Curious, right? Is it okay if I go home by myself? Sure. Oh... Just a few days. I'll leave your meals in the freezer. And... I'll be fine. Thanks for today. The food was fairly good. Thank you. Good night. Good night. Chief. My new recipe. Another one? The black things? They're raisins. Why? What? Why? They add accent to the flavor. Like melons with prosciutto? Sort of... Stylish housewives will like it. Try this. Accentuated flavor. Okay. Let's see. It works. I like it. Let's put it on the shelf. A small quantity for starters. - Thanks. - It's good. Even unstylish housewives will like it. We're going to have some company for your birthday next week. The bath is ready. I already took it. No, you didn't. I can't take my bath until you do. You always take the bath first. It's been like that for years. This is too flaky. You think so? You used to like it. "Kokoro by soseki natsume" it's good. It's on the washing machine. Washing machine? On top of it. Your pajamas. "Business management for beginners" how can you eat that now? I was craving it on the plane. So what's the talk about? Dad wants to talk about money. Really? Mom said she didn't want to talk about it over the phone. It must be one of her tactics. What? To make us go home. She threatened you to do your homework for your future. She gave me 50 yen. You were paid to do your homework? - You didn't know? - No. - Are you mad? - Too late to be mad. Sorry I didn't come back for almost a year. I'm still trying to get used to my life over there. I'm the older sister but I'm making you take care of our parents. Don't worry about it. Fumi... thank you. So, how are they? Fine. I saw them over new year's. New year's? It's November now. You haven't seen them for almost as long as me. This is delicious. Did I teach you how to make this? No. They're my original recipes. Takashi's english has gotten so good in a year. Are you also fluent? Kids learn really fast. I'm still struggling. Dad, they add accent. Fumi, how's America? Nice, especially the climate. I'm mari. Happy birthday. How old are you? Almost 33. Today, it's not my... So, dad... how are you? Reading every day?

He was a school principal. He'll be fine. Dad. You didn't come back. Where's the book? Book? The good one you mentioned. Ah, yes... the book... book... Take your time. Now leave me alone.

He shouldn't miss the funeral. I suppose not. How's 20,000 yen? Me? Mr. Nakamura gave you new year's money every year. Now? After all these years? "My own child's teeth..." "Teeth..." "Began to come through..." "My own child's teeth have begun...” Fumi will go with you. Fumi? But she has to practice... You know... that thing... Clarinet. She's not a schoolgirl anymore. She's working now. Oh, that's right. She's a teacher now. I'm proud. No. Fumi is... I should go back now. Thank you. This is your home. Where you go back to. The house where we've lived for 35 years. I wanted to meet you! I wanted to meet you! I wanted to meet you! I wanted to meet you! You! I wanted to meet you! So great. Can I... What's wrong? Don't think you can kiss me whenever you want just because you did before. But I thought you're my girl. Yeah, well, maybe. But I think you'd look cooler if you started working out. So, we can hang out over summer vacation, right? Like I told you, I'm going to be with my grandad in Arizona. But from next week, right? So let's get together this week. How 'bout tomorrow? I can see you next Tuesday, okay? Yeah, but, that night... Why don't you take me? I could finally meet takamina... You know I can't... Besides, Tuesday night my mom and dad are going out... Shin, how is it going? Good luck with your work. Hey. Why do I have to go to Japan? Like I said, if we don't go home, grandpa will forget about you. You're his only grandchild. Can't we at least wait until after Tuesday? Why not Tuesday? Just because... Something weird going on with Beth. She didn't even post the pictures of us I told you to speak Japanese at home. So you want me to go home by myself again? Can I say something? You keep saying "go home." Isn't this your home now? What's your point? Mummichog. A small north American fish I'm studying right now. It's constantly evolving. It's a saltwater fish but can also live in fresh water. It can also tolerate high temperatures and chemical pollution. Its brain secretes hormones that enable it to adapt. Cool. Are you trying to tell me something? Takashi, will you go with your mother? Okay. "Memorial services for tetsuo Nakamura" Thank you for the new year's money. Dad... You've had enough. Let's go home. Higashi! Higashi, right? I knew it was you. It's good to see you. Thanks for coming. Who's this? Fumi, his daughter. Hello. You must be intelligent like your father. Are you a teacher too? No. My job isn't that respectable. I see... I'm hagiwara. I was also on the judo team in college. In the team competitions, I fought the first match. You fought second to last. That's right. Higashi. Let's drink to the judo team's reunion. The three of us. To our reunion. Cheers. By the way his wife wants one of us to give a eulogy at tomorrow's funeral. You'll do it, won't you? No. He's not feeling well. He's forgetful. We all are at our age. Okay? You knew Nakamura better than anyone. Of course. So... How's Nakamura? How? Colorectal cancer. He got an artificial anal sphincter but the cancer spread to his liver. Our brawny friend became so gaunt in the end. The strong judo player... Couldn't beat the disease. Higashi, he lost. Our captain. You should give the eulogy tomorrow. No. It's Nakamura's funeral. It has to be your dad. Funeral? Nakamura's dead?! I'll give the eulogy. Let's go. Nakamura... Dad, let's go home. Sorry about that. Dad. Excuse us. Sorry. Come on. Dad. Ippon! Nakamura wins! Dad, please... let's go. Sorry. Dad... Nakamura! Nakamura! Who knows how to read this "kanji"? The answer is "killer whale." Did you get it right? That was a difficult one. Last question. The answer is "sea anemone." "Sea anemone." Did you get it right? Too difficult? Mr. higashi got them all right. You know many kanji. Of course I do. I used to be... you know... At the school... Wonderful. Perfect score. Good job. I caught small fish in that river even now, I still dream of those days of past how I miss my old hometown Mr. higashi. What are you doing? I should go back. I see. If you stay a little longer, we'll drive you home. But the rain... I'm worried. We'll give you an umbrella later. Beth... I'm your grandson. I arrived from America this morning. Grandma went shopping with mom. They should be back soon. Mr. higashi. Your grandson? I don't think so. [T's me, takashi. I live in America. America? Are you American? No, I'm Japanese. Your daughter's son. Mr. higashi. Your daughter's son is your grandson. You're my grandson? Grandpa, that hurts. Grandpa. Do you have a computer? I want to check a blog. Who are you? Takashi, your grandson. Come sit over here. Look at these kanji. Can you read them? Kanji is popular at my school, especially the complex ones. What's this? "Concrete." Wow. It's so cool. This? "Koala." I get it. This? "Badger game." What's that? Whatever it is, it's the coolest. You're amazing. Can I call you kanji master? If you wish. Okay, kanji master. Can 1? Write this in kanji. "Elizabeth" Grandpa? Grandpa? Where are you? Kanji master! What were you doing? I dozed off. Dozed off? Listen... Go around the neighborhood. I'll call fumi and decide what to do. Hurry up. Take the bicycle. He went to the river the other day. Okay. He sometimes wanders off saying he has to go back. Go back where? I don't know. He says he wants to go home even when he's home. Go home... Just two weeks. Pathetic. Don't take it so hard. I had a great time. I'm so sorry. There's something I want to do. I'm thinking of leaving Tokyo. I want to help people. Help people in a direct way. I don't know how yet. But probably not in Tokyo. I see. I hope you find it. One day, I know I will. I'm going now. W ait. Here. For the month. I'll take half. No. I know how much you make. Thank you. Good luck. "Home" "go to the river. He might be there." Takashi is on his way. Look. What's that? What a dork. No kidding. There he is. Grandpa! Dad. Takashi. What are you doing? This guy found him. Thank you. I appreciate... What? Michihiko? You remember. A classmate from middle school. Oh yeah? He didn't know where he was. I recognized him. Did you really? I used to practice at your house. Clarinet. Brass band practice. You remember. We practiced at your house like twice a week. We were really into it. Brings back memories. You got married 5 years ago, didn't you? Yeah... Auntie, look at grandpa. Dad. This is my job. I started 3 months ago. I know you're disappointed. You wanted me to be a teacher. Is this a restaurant? Sort of. I cook inside and sell the food. I'm proud of you. You are? Do you want veggies or chicken? I want both. Okay. Hold on. Oh yeah. - Takashi. - What? Tell your mom we'll be home soon. Here. Okay. Fumi. Come take a look. Stay in line. Dad... Form a straight line. Good. I'll help. You need it. I'm not giving up. Thanks. What's your wife like? We're divorced. Last year. I see. GPS? Yeah. If he has a cell phone with GPS, we'll know where to find him. But he's a man. I'm sure he wants his privacy. I doubt it. Dad, does it look familiar? We're going back to your hometown. Takashi. Enjoy the scenery. Okay, okay. What is it? Let's go. Grandpa? Ready? One, two, three. This must be you and dad. Oh my... we took this here. Outside. Wow. You're wearing a miniskirt. You look cute. You stole dad's heart. You think? Chilled in the well. It looks good. Dad loves watermelons. Thank you, kosuke. We have lots of watermelons in our field out back. Uncle can eat as much as he wants. Thank you. You're welcome. Go ahead. Here. Big one. This photo... It was taken the first time your dad brought me here. Over 40 years ago. To introduce his bride-to-be? We met during the year of the Tokyo Olympics. It was two years later. I still remember it clearly. We took the train together. "Bontan ame" candies in the blue box. The ones we take on trips. We ate them. We sang a song that was popular at the time. He's surprisingly a good singer. Did you ever... Get sick of dad? Well... He's stubborn and he put his work over spending time with the family. I guess so. What does it mean to be married? I don't know yet either. We haven't been together long enough. Let's look up when we walk so our tears don't fall Tonight I'm all by my lonesome happiness rests on the clouds happiness soars in the sky let's look up when we walk so our tears don't fall Tonight I'm all by my lonesome There's a pond with koi and turtles. Aren't you happy? You wanted to come back, right? These days... Things seem so far away. Far away? A lot of things. Including you and the others. Being far away feels sad, doesn't it? The house has been renovated. But the view hasn't changed at all. You're not connected to the Internet, are you? Yes, we are. Really? Can I use it? Sure. It's in that room. Thank you. Here. Who are you? Kosuke, your nephew. Huh? Who's Ken? Where are they? You're kidding. I'm going back. But we're here. The house where you grew up. You wanted to come, right? But... I have to go. Let's not leave just yet. Sit down. Okay, dad? Dad? Who's that? I'm not married. - Uncle, easy now. - Uncle? Have some watermelon. I'll get more. I wanna go home. Now you? She's with Ken. I'm going back. Me too. Right now. They get along so well. We're not leaving yet. Enough, both of you! What is it? It's time... Time? It's time... To go back somewhere again? I want to introduce you to my parents. Oh dear... you're being silly. You'll meet them, won't you? Yes. "2 years later spring 2011" "theory of relativity" It's easier to read it like this. You're welcome. I'm yoko, your wife. Green tea polyphenols are good for the brain. I'll make you green tea every day. It looks delicious. I want to serve it here. But you already have a great recipe. For an ordinary omelet and rice. The good traditional type. I'm taking my break. "Kitchen suzuran" fumi... do you... Want to get married? I suppose you don't want a man who's been divorced. That's not an issue. If you and my son get married... If you do, I'll retire. You can run this restaurant. You can remodel it to make it more attractive to younger customers. Maybe my son will help out. Sorry. It's just wishful thinking. It's okay. I was also... Hello. Take any seat. - Two omelet and rice. - Yes, sir. One large serving. Okay. A present. You knew? Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Open it. Why? Why not? I shouldn't. What? Am I confused? My daughter's birthday? No. Our year-and-a-half anniversary of being together. A year and a half? I knew that. I knew but it slipped my mind. Aren't you seeing her tonight? It's been two years. I thought you saw her time to time. She's still two to me. Uh-oh... earthquake! Shortly after a massive Tsunami crashed the shore and devastated many coastal towns and villages in the region. A picture of incredible destruction and loss of life in the region is now emerging. And though the official death toll is still reported as being in the hundreds, this number will... The radiation is deadly. Promise me you won't leave the house when it's raining. We have to go buy toilet paper. You have a washlet toilet. Use a towel. I'm not going to use a towel. Massive amounts of cesium are flying toward Tokyo. Be sure to wear a mask and a hat when you go out. No good over the phone. I should go home. Going back to Japan now won't change a thing. But... How are they going to survive? Dad is getting worse. If something happens to mom... We all have to be responsible for our own lives. Isn't that right? But they're my family. I know that. Hi, takashi. I'll prepare dinner. I already ate. I told you to call me when you're eating out. Gimme a break, I'm busy now. No english. Talk to him. We're a family. I hope we're home before it rains. I'm hot. Keep it on. Cesium. "We're open" "hello." People must be eating at home. It sort of seems that way. "I have plans on Sunday." "My daughter wants to see me. Sorry. Michihiko" from michihiko? No. A friend. "Security camera operating” Let's put on our masks before we step outside. Good. It's not raining yet. Excuse me. You didn't pay. Yes, we did. Pardon me. Oh? Oh my gosh... No... Come with me. "Bontan ame candies" there are a lot of old people "bontan ame candies" who pretend to be senile. We wouldn't do that. My husband is really... He has... Dementia sir, who is this woman? Isn't she your wife? Why? He's forgotten that I'm his wife. But he recognizes and knows me. I'm so sorry about this. No use apologizing. He's not remorseful. He'll do it again. What will you do then? I'm sorry. No! Go stand outside. Hallway. Hallway. He's hopeless. Have somebody come get them. Okay. We're very sorry. We'll be on our way. Let's go. Umbrella. Sorry, again. Watch your step. I'm sorry. Mom. I left some cookies by the door for momoka. Is her mom going to be there? She can't come by herself. That's true. She's only four. I'm going. See you. Coming back tonight? Yeah. I'll call you later. Okay. Hello? Fumi, your dad is saying he's going home again. Stop! Where are you going with three umbrellas? Fumi, will you talk to him? Distract him a little bit? I'll be there in 10 minutes. Oh, you're close by. "Momoka" Good? Dry. That's not very nice. Don't eat it then. Thanks. Dad... It's over. It's over again. Dad... When things don't last... It's sad. I'm okay. I don't have a cold. Well... Don't... Don't get "dissappointable.” "Dissappointable"? Yeah. Don't get "dissappointable.” But I'm "dissappointable.” Are you? I'm "dissappointable.” After the earthquake everybody's talking about staying connected and bonding. Not really. Yes really. No matter how hard I try... I can't beat his family. You have to... Just say phew. Phew. At school... Things like that happened a lot. At school? At school. Everywhere. At middle school. Phew. Ask this woman to come inside. You were out here a long time. What did you talk about? Nothing much. Just nonsense. Is that right? It looked like a real conversation. Phew! Takashi, are you there? Your grandpa... He doesn't understand words anymore. The other day, he was caught shoplifting. I'm... So shocked and worried. I'm going back to Japan tomorrow. I care about you as much as I care about him. I worry about you. But... I don't know what to do. So... I might make you worry too. Sorry. If you quit your job, you should be dad's caretaker. My husband will pay you. I'm not going to take money for looking after my father. You got paid for doing homework. I was a kid. What should we do? Mom and dad can't be alone forever. We have to start considering putting dad in a facility. Mom would never agree. It's easy for you to say. You live comfortably overseas but I'm at their Beck and call. Comfortably overseas? I've also been considering a facility. Before something happens... It's mom. Hello? He's gone? What? When? He kept repeating "I'm going back" since this morning. I'm a bit constipated and while I was in the bathroom... - It's flashing. - This is dad." That's where he is? On the tracks. Hey... Oh no... is he...? It disappeared. Is he dead? There he is. Thank god. He's alive. It's moving down the tracks. Oh... he must be on a train. Good luck. Why cheer him on? Because I want to. This is... Your father. Fumi, where is he? He went in. Why would he want to go there? He doesn't even like it. Fumi, hurry. I think there was one time we were at an amusement park with dad. We were all there. You're kidding. Are you sure you weren't dreaming? He's the kind of man who read a book by himself on family outings. Hello. Um... I have a question. What would you do if you saw a helpless little girl in front of you? He should be around here. - Here? - Do you see him? Where is he? Dad... Look more carefully. Where is he? Look. Was that dad? What is he doing? Oh my... We didn't have to worry. Mom... Fumi and I were talking. Isn't it time? To put dad in a facility? He did come here once before. You two were about their age. It was only the three of us at first. It suddenly turned cloudy. It was going to rain. He came here to get us. With umbrellas. Dad? He did something like that? I was surprised too. But I immediately knew why he came. That morning fumi was sniffling, coming down with a cold. Oh yeah? So that's why. He must have come here to pick us up again. Is this where he wanted to "go back" to? Who knows. Dad! He saw us. Really? Let's wave at him next. Here he comes. Dad! I think he smiled a little. I think so too. Did he really? There he is again. "2 years later fall and winter 2013" Istanbul or Tokyo? Which will it be? The host city in 2020 is... Tokyo! Great. The olympic games are coming to Tokyo again. Your ride to daycare will be here. I'll prepare breakfast. Wouldn't it be nice to watch the Olympics together again? Yes! Ms. higashi. Will you think of two or three new Autumn recipes for people of all ages? With ingredients of the season? - Okay. - Looking forward to them. Uh... chief? - About what you said... - I know. You don't want a full-time position. No. I'm sorry. I thought you'd say that. Good luck. "Tama municipal hospital" Fumi. Sorry to call you at work. I took the afternoon off. I suddenly couldn't see out of the left half of this eye. I'd lost the vision from the left edge a while ago. The doctor told me. You need surgery right away. It's retinal detachment. It could cause blindness. I won't be hospitalized. You'd rather go home than save your vision? It's only two weeks. Who'll take care of your father during that time? He'll be back from daycare later today. I'll go home. No. I'll go home. Can you change his soiled underwear? Don't worry. I'll do my best. So you have to get the operation. And get well as quickly as possible. I'll try. I'll try hard. I'll make my hospital stay as short as possible. Hi. What's wrong? I got a call from takashi's school. He's been skipping school. He leaves the house every morning. It seems like he's hanging out at a friend's house all day. - Is he home? - Not yet. He should be soon. Will you talk to him? He must have his reasons. He has to make his own decisions and move forward. Fine. I'll talk to him. One more thing. My mom has retinal detachment. Fumi is taking care of dad. So I won't go back to Japan. Good night. Will you taste this? Here. You like potatoes. How is it? Are you okay? Dad? Where are you? Dad? What are you doing? I'm pulling it down. Don't worry. I've seen men's private parts. You didn't want to hear that, huh? Here we go. He fell asleep. Is everything okay? More or less. Mom is amazing. She does this every day. "I'm sorry I can't be there." It's okay. I'm managing. How are you? You look tired. Do I? We're all doing fine over here. Good. Mom's surgery is tomorrow. Fumi. You changed. You think so? How? More family-ish. What does that mean? You're so reliable. - "How to start your own cafe" - Not nearly as much as mom. Mom, what are you doing? That voice... my younger daughter. The doctor told me to lie face down as much as I can. Do you have to stay in that position all the time? I'm going to stay like this as long as there's gas in my eye. I have no idea what you're talking about. Didn't the doctor tell you? There's a gas bubble in my eye. Lying face down makes it rise to the top and push the retina in place. Oh, okay. So fumi... How's your dad? The caretaker is with him. He'll be in respite care for a week starting tomorrow. Don't worry. Okay. You're not eating these days. You should eat. I have to go now. I'll stay a little bit longer. Oh yeah. I started this too. "Kanji drill" using computers makes you forget a lot of kanji. Teach me. Let's see. - "Hozuki flower" - Can you write this? Too difficult? This one? "Autumn foliage" Autumn foliage. Dad. How about this one? Who is it? Fumi. What is it? Are you wearing a sad face? Mom... I'm sorry. Dad is hospitalized. What happened? We didn't know at first. He had a high fever for a while so they ran some tests. A crack in his right femur. Why? Mom... Is your face angry? I'll leave it to your imagination. Which hospital was he admitted to? This one. A room one floor below. Are you serious? He's right below us? Oh dear... I made potage with potatoes. How is it? Dad... There's more. There's more. Good morning, everybody in shinjuku! How are you?! As people hurry to their workplaces a woman in a cheerleading uniform cheers them on. She stands here almost 200 days out of the year rooting for the passersby. I'm here almost every weekday. "Mio konishi" I want people to start off their day with a smile. I want to help people. "Go, go, businessmen! Go, fight, win!" Mio... Have a great day! I hope you have a wonderful day! Hello. First bed. Second bed. It's you. You came? I have to keep my face down. I'm going to use your knee. What? That tickles. Your hand is warm. Close the curtain. This kind of thing is often a sign of problems at home-marital problems, that kind of thing. I hate to ask, but is everything okay at home? Yes-no problem there. What did she say? Um... She wants us to tell takashi to come to school. It was longer than that. Translate properly. The cause is usually problems at home. Marital problems. Are you okay? Don't worry, my wife is fine. I... I want to... Talk to my husband more often. Understand each other better. Love each other more. Be needed. Be kissed every day. I'm sorry? What? It was nothing, just. Translate. What? No. Why not? - It's embarrassing. - Translate. - No! - For takashi! - Is it for him? - Please! For our family! Idiot! Are you okay? Mom. I'm glad you're better. Can you see clearly? Yes. I think better than before. Look. It's mari from California. Fumi, can I have some time alone with dad? Okay. Let's go to the cafeteria. See you later. You two, have fun. Dad... What should I do? Takashi hardly says a word to me. He's skipping school. He might even flunk. Mr. higashi. As a teacher what would you say to him? It's... Probably my fault. I wish we were like you and mom. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. Sis... listen. Dad's not doing well. He has a bad case of pneumonia. He's not getting better. He's in the icu. He's in a daze and he has trouble breathing. I got it. You okay? Here. Is it clean? Yes. You do the laundry every day. When your dad gets better, let me know your return flight. I'll be at the airport. Even if it's a weekday? Yeah. Even if it's during the day? Yeah. I'll leave the lab and go pick you up. What if... The weather is bad and the flight is delayed for hours? Yes. I'll wait for you at the airport. Here. Are you sure it's clean? Huh? Yeah... I think so. Maybe. Give it to me. Thank you very much. I think you are a kind gentleman. You're welcome. As dementia progresses, the cerebral cortex becomes impaired. Patients have difficulty chewing and swallowing food. Food, liquid, even bacteria get breathed into the lungs. That's what causes aspiration pneumonia. I'm afraid he'll soon lose the ability to breathe on his own. Come in. - You're late. - Sorry. I'm sorry. Is that cake? Yes. I made it for our father's birthday today. For your father? Yes. We're going to eat it. I wanted to see you today to ask if you'd like to put him on an artificial respirator. Will it make him more comfortable? His breathing, yes. But once he goes on it, it'll probably be permanent. Permanent? Does that mean... It won't help him recover? Yes, that's what it means. It's painful to watch. But... We don't know what to do. How's takashi? Let's look up when we walk so our tears don't fall I remember those spring days tonight I'm all by my lonesome "bontan ame candies" Shin... Says he'll respect our decision. I sent a text to takashi. What do you think? I don't think it's what he wants. You? I think... He won't want it. You two. Don't be so sure. How would you know what he's thinking? We'll agree with whatever you decide, mom. So... Take your time and think about it. Don't take me lightly. I've already decided... A long time ago. Is it takashi? What does he say? He wants him to stay alive as long as he's alive. Okay. Let's have his birthday party. Fumi, you came prepared. We're wearing them here? Yes. We can't celebrate a birthday without them. Seriously? How do I look? No space. Will you pull him? Pull him? He has to wear it too. Not the right leg. - This leg. - How far? - 15 centimeters. - Ready? Okay. Pull. - Further. - Further? Ready? Wait. Push him back. We can't keep moving him up and down. Oh well... this will work. To think about it, isn't it weird? Why do we wear this for our festivities? Why ask now? We've been doing it for decades. I like it. It feels like we're bonding as a family. Yeah. It shows how much you love our family. It wasn't my idea. I thought of it as an unspoken family rule. Whose idea was it? Oh, dad... I'm sorry, dad. I had it for so long. You got a package! Coming. Mom, I'll get it. Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. "Yugo ohata" "I thought you could use them now." "Yugo" mom! I'm going to stay another night. I'll make potato salad. Make sure to put raisins in it. Come on in. Have a seat. You know why I asked you here today, takashi? Yes... I want you to do something for me, takashi. Tell me something about yourself- anything at all. Something about school, or what you ate for breakfast! Me, this morning I put cream cheese and honey on my bagel, and the whole time my wife was on my case about all the calories. My grandfather died. Really was he sick? Yeah, for a long time. He was forgetting everything... Sounds like "dementia". My mother was like that too at the end. My grandmother said it started seven years ago. Seven years that certainly is a long time. A long goodbye. A long goodbye? They call dementia "the long goodbye." One by one, their memories disappear. Bit by bit, they get further and further away, until... Tell me, takashi... what's your strongest memory of your grandpa? Well, he could write a lot of "kanji". "Kanji"? Those pictographic symbols? So complex... Uh-huh. He could even write the really hard ones, no problem. I called him "kanji master." Yeah... Whoa, very cool. What's it say? Actually, it's a secret, from a really long time ago. Well, there it is... That's all I have to say. Maybe some time you can tell me more about yourself. May I go now? By the way, takashi does your ditching school have something to do with your grandpa? Nope... not at all. Uh-huh, just as I thought. Take care, takashi. Take care, master.
