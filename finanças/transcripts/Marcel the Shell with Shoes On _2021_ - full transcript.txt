Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Okay, are you ready? I guess. And speeding. What's that? I want to start with some questions. Oh, got it. Is it hard for you? Has it been hard for you since... Mmm... Not in the way that I think you would think it would be, but... Uh, it's pretty much common knowledge that it takes at least 20 shells to have a community. That that's about the minimum that you need to survive, so... Yeah. I think at first I was thinking we're not gonna make it. But sometimes you just have to disregard those rules and think, "Well, actually, the rule is "that I want to be having a good life "and stay alive, and... And not just survive, but have a good life. Tell me about what's life like now? It... Me? Uh... I appreciate its different beauties, but it... it's not the way I would've done things if I was still in the group. But they're not here. So, that's why I have the electric mixer. - Ready? - Mmm-hmm. Ta-da! I mean, I don't want my voice in it. Well, that's up to you. So, stop asking me questions is what I'm saying. Oh! Oh, okay. Do your parents work? Have you ever met a chef? What happens if you break this? Have you ever eaten a raspberry? Um, and what was that like? Are you gonna ask me questions? Hello? Oh, man, this is weird. I don't want my voice in it. How am I supposed to ask you questions? There are actually only two of us now. Myself... ...and my grandmother, Nana Connie. Back when the man and the woman lived here, there were a lot of us. More sounds and smells and, uh, things to say 'cause there were more people to talk to. - There... A stage. - All right! Ah! Up. These days, it's quieter. Rolling. Give me some levels. Give... Give you some levels? Like... Just, like, talk a little bit. Like, oh, uh... - Hello, my name is... - Darn it. It's not the first time I've done that. My name is Marcel, and I'm partially a shell as you can see on my body, but I also have shoes, and, um, a face. So, I like that about myself, and I like myself, and I have a lot of other great qualities as well. That was perfect. Okay. Is this the wild tone right now? - Yes. - Ugh. Just stay still for 30 seconds. How long you gonna... What are you trying to do with all this? Um... I'm making, like, a little documentary that I might put online. - Online? - Yeah. Eh, you lost me. Ugh. Are you okay? Itchy. Are you recording? Yeah. Right now? Yeah. Oh. Well, what should I be doing? Just, well, don't do anything. Just do whatever you'd normally be doing, like if I weren't here. Where'd you get the rope? This? Uh, It... I... I'll show you. I come to the bathroom, I get these curly hairs. They're the strongest 'cause you have to uncurl it, but, um, then you can see it's really long and strong. But... Hey, what are you laughing at? We call 'em hardy hairs. This is the arboretum, a collection of trees that a community keeps alive, but I do like to talk to them, and plants like to have classical music played for them. Mozart and Brahms, it helps them grow faster. This is my bread room. Uh, it's a bedroom, but I sleep on a piece of bread, so I... Whoa, sorry. He's just saying hi. I actually like the concept of having a dog. Oh, God, I can smell his face. But I just tie a hair to a piece of lint, and I drag it around. I love you. Come on. Come on. That's it. Sometimes, people say that my head is too big for my body. And then I say, "Compared to what?" Sometimes, if I don't have a way to itch my itch, the only thing I can do is I just stand there. I just let it get me and I just... I just have to scream it out. He's your best friend? Don't you know any other guys or... Cool. Hmm. I never get it the first time. Nope. Oh, dang it. Oh! Go, go, go! Boom! There it is. You miss a 100% of the shots you don't take. Wow. That's a quote. I didn't make that up. It's by a famous sports player named Wayde... Wayde Gansdy... What is it? Ways... Way... Whale... Whale Gensky. Are you thinking of Wayne... Gensky. Whale... Wayne... Could that be his name? Whale Jetski? No. No? - Wake... Lake... Jake? - Well... Wayne Jet... Jet... Get... This is my stockpile. All right, so, we got your basics here. I got couple of almonds. I have a dozen peanuts. It's basically your dry goods. You got a craisin with the raisins, but the craisin sits to the side because it is a treat. Uh... Is... Is this an inhaler? It's like... It's like a slide or something... Like, I don't even actually know what it this is. Where did you get that from? From one of the people that stayed here for a night. Why? Did you take anything from me? Mmm... What is wrong with you? I didn't know. Give me that. I didn't know what it was. So, these are all the parts put together. Mmm-hmm. And then now what? I'm gonna put it on the Internet, and people can watch it. Oh. Oh, no. Your soda can is almost empty. Whoa. Sorry. Hold on one second. All right. I don't know why you would... What... What is cleaning the house if all she does is move things around, and disturb the entire environment? She doesn't. She's doing dishes right now. She's the harbinger of the vacuum. I can't tell her to go home. I mean, that's her scheduled cleaning. But why? She was hired by the lady that is, like, the Airbnb host. What? The... Airbnb? Mmm, what is Airbb? To clean. Oh, that's you! Oh, who's she? Oh... I don't... Oh, wow, wait, what? That's outside of here. Yeah. Somehow, this has kind of turned into like a computer hotel? Sort of, yeah. Why did you decide... Why are you here? I had to move out of my old place, so I'm staying here until I find a new one. Why did you have to move out? Uh, that's personal. Okay. You never talked to anyone who stayed here before? Eh... People don't usually notice us. Aw, dang it. I got to go check on Nana Connie if this lady's gonna be running the vacuum. This is the rover. Ow! It's a good thing I don't, like, "care" care about this car because I can't figure out where I'm going in this thing. Oops, what was that? Sorry. No, no, no. Arthur. Hopefully, she's right around the corner here. And there she is. That's a load off. Can you just wait here for one sec because I do think that with you and with the camera, - it's just I... That I... - Okay. I just want to warn her. Yeah. Okay. Brown head-hair, and he has glasses. You want me to leave? No, no, no, no, no! I want you to stay is what I... - Yeah. - Just careful - where you step. - Yeah, I know. - I just brought him by. - You're making what? A documentary. It's like... Oh, it's like a movie, but nobody has any lines, and nobody even knows what it is while they're making it. Mmm... No? That's sort of a way to put it, yeah. No, I just am making a little video portrait. - About Marcel? - Yeah. - A... A film? - Uh, yeah. It's like the truth, kind of. It's a... And it's the truth about Marcel? I mean, I hope so. I guess he could really spin it, and make me look like a total... So, this is your garden out here, huh? - Yes. - Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you for the aromas. My house was very popular. I had lots of friends. And if you told me then, many years ago, that I would've spent so much time in a garden, I would've said, "Are you kidding?" Okay, you see these ones? You can feel them. They're not quite ripe, but in a few days, they would be. It wasn't easy. I didn't know anything about farming. Because when the couple still lived here, there was always food. In the pantry, in the kitchen, there were stacks here and there. But when they went away the food disappeared. So, I had to taught myself how to farm. "Planting, harvesting..." She's always been a pretty tough cookie. Everything has a function with her. There's no one button that's there for decoration. - You know what I mean? - Mmm-hmm. She's just like a backhoe. But I will say you can really see her tender side when she's working with the bugs. Is she okay? Yeah, she's okay, she's a little loopy. She had a little bit too much, uh, nectar. Vino fiore, right, Franny? My community found the bugs to be deeply unlikeable. Okay, we'll put her here in the sun. And in a few seconds, she'll be dry. But Connie's made friends with many of them, and in return, they actually help her with the gardening. ...at first, found them a little yucky but now I see their beauty. I cannot stand this thing. Because they turn the soil, they break it... It's wonderful to have them. His whole body looks like his pants are off. It reminds me of Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act, how she helps them to do graffiti in a meaningful way or something, and... Oh, there she goes. - Oops! - Ow, ow, ow. She's gone. Uh, sort of. Oh, wow. What is, uh... What is this? - Hmm? - What's that? What are you doing now with Marcel? Oh, I'm making a movie. Uh... A documentary. - About Marcel? - Yeah. A documentary? Uh, a film? Yeah. Ah, Marcel. You remember, Nan, we were just talking about it. It's a movie, and we're doing it together, but... - what I just said before. - That's what you... And we just joked about it. - Yes. - It's the truth, but it's the truth about me... She has lost a small piece... ...of a very large puzzle. Nan! Nana! Once or twice a week, I'll find her in here, snoozing in the laundry basket and... Is it bad for her to be in here? Yeah, it's not the safest place to be. You know, my cousin fell asleep in a pocket, and that's why I don't like the saying, "Everything comes out in the wash," because sometimes it doesn't. Or sometimes it does, and they're just like a completely different person. 'Cause after that, my cousin would just sit by the window and wait for fire trucks to go by. Guess what I use to tie my skis to my car. What? A hair. Guess what my... MARCEL THE SHELL WITH SHOES ON Guess... Guess what my skis are. What? Toe nails from a man. Wait, hold on. So, you're telling me that 84 different people have just watched? Yeah, isn't that cool? Yeah. I mean... Geez. What? Just... Wow. What do you do when you get bored? Uh, I move around. I could tell he's performing a little bit for you, - you know? - Mmm-hmm. Da, da, da, da. You're giving him a stage. It's good for him. One, two... The stage makes him feel good. Playful. He needs that. He hasn't been able to get that since the others were taken from us. Okay, so do you just want me to start at the beginning? I don't actually know how it started, but the man and the woman started to yell at each other more often than they would talk to each other. You'd just hear these big noises from the sky, and my cousin's house fell down this one time when the office door got slammed. We started to have a shelter plan. We all go to the sock drawer, and so everyone will be safe there. This was a Sunday, and everybody gets together, and we all watch 60 Minutes as a community. 60 Minutes, the... Yeah. So, this is where we were... - And... - Every week, all of you? Yeah. We love it. We just call it "The show." That's how much we love it. Lesley. Who's Lesley? Lesley Show. She likes Lesley Stahl. I'm Lesley Stahl... She blows cases wide open, and she's got class. ...tonight on 60 Minutes. But... We could tell that something was the matter because the clock started ticking... ...and it was just the two of us there. It was a big one. And we had... We had no warning. What we think is that everybody scooted into the sock drawer, and, uh... And the man just... ...dumped all the drawers into a suitcase. And then he left. And that's... That's how they got moved. I... Oh... Do you want a tissue? Yeah. Do you mind if I just plop into it real quick? Sure. Shoot. This can be our last thing. Okay. It's always what they say on the days when you have a really keen sense of being lost or losing something, that it... It often feels like the sun shines the brightest. And then the next day, there was a really sunny day with a good breeze. And I just remember thinking, "if I was somebody else, "I would really be enjoying this." Mmm-hmm. Whoa! Geez. Okay, here it is. So, tell me a little bit about who you put on here. I put, first and foremost, my parents, Catherine and Mario, next to each other with a heart. My brother is here and here... ...and I put my music teacher, The Maestro. Wow! Yeah! I love that one, it sounds like Taps. Do you know that? Yeah. Do you want to hear Taps? Sure. Do you feel angry? Uh, I just feel angry that we didn't have a better goodbye. Who would you say goodbye to? I'd like to say goodbye to my neighbors, the Costas. Goodbye, the Costas, even though we had a language barrier. You were my neighbors. You always liked to garden. Goodbye, Richard, you were the worst singer in our class, but I loved how you let me cut you in line. Goodbye, Anka, your sense of timing is one of the worst. Bye, Sandra, you were my favorite author. Goodbye, Mrs. Kim. The time that you ate a pepper flake and it made you fly into the wall was one of the funniest yet most serious accidents any of us ever witnessed, and you bore it with great grace and bravery. Goodbye, Brad. Thank you so much for rolling that marble into my bread room. I still keep it to this day. Yep. And that... And there they all are. - Guess why I smile a lot. - Why? Uh, 'cause it's worth it. Um... Uh, whatcha doing? Looking for apartments. So, do you have any plans tonight? No. I'm gonna... - Give me that. - No! No! Whoa. Marcel, look at this. It... Aren't I... Wait. Is this normal for you? No, this never happens. - It's so cool. - 22 million? It's wonderful. Yeah, it's, uh, broad... Broad spectrum of emotions. I didn't even know there were that many people. Okay, now jump really hard. Have you guys seen Marcel the Shell? It's a YouTube video. My name is Marcel, and I'm partially a shell. My name is Marcel, and I'm a shell as you can see on my body, but... Oh, so nice. ...as a beanbag? A raisin. The wildly popular online character, Marcel the Shell With Shoes On... Marcel... Marcel the Shell With Shoes On. "When the kush hit..." "Kush"? What is kush? I... It goes so deep, and... They got tattoos. It's just so many people, I... I kind of regret this tattoo. Here it is. It's like a snail. Um, I just saw it online, but it was like super puffy the day after, and I don't know why, and the tattoo guy couldn't say why. And then, a couple of months later, I found out that I... Today, I'm going to be popping popcorn with a magnifying glass. So right now we have... There's all these people, and... And we're all looking at the same thing, and we're all doing the same thing. We're watching the guys... It's beautiful. And... And it feels like... I don't even know how to describe it. It feels like something. Move, move, move! It's really lovely. Are you okay? Yes, yes. I'm okay. I'm okay. So, are you going to eat it? You can eat this stuff? Yeah, dude! What does it taste like? Oh, my gosh, you're gonna love it. So good, isn't it? It's all been really fun, and having all this happen, and... And, uh... You know, it's so big feeling, and it's so nice. Um... Let it go! Let it go! The other part of it is I think I find my mind wandering a bit just thinking, what would my family think, and really noticing that they're not here to share it with me. I do wonder what... What my dad would say, what my mom would say, and, yeah... I think they'd like it a lot. Oh! There she goes. Oh, beautiful. Hmm. There must be so many others like me. It's impossible that there wouldn't be, and not just my family. They're out there. Somewhere out there. Every time I do this, that dog goes totally crazy. He sees something truly elegant in the sky, and this is his reaction? What a sad type of idiot. Wow, this is... Well, yeah, I don't think that's gonna yield much. No. Right, but... - Probably. - You know... What's the matter? Do you think they could be out there? Uh, I mean... Maybe. All right, I think that's it. We are live streaming. And do I look at you, or should I look right into the thing? Me. Quick, uh, no, the camera. It's gonna take a picture. Okay, well... Hi, everybody. It's Marcel from before, and I'm recording this video because I'm looking for my family. They were last seen with this man. His name is Mark. They disappeared from the house owned by a woman named Larissa. Here it is. What we do is manage properties that are on the short-term rental market, so if somebody's out of town for a long time and just wants to rent a place for a while, we do that. So would you give me her number? If there's a problem with the property, I can send someone out, but I can't give you any personal information. Uh-huh. Hey, have you ever eaten a raspberry? Hello? Darn it. Just go for it. This is what they look like. Uh, right here, and here and here. Um, I made this just to give you a sense of who to be on the lookout for. Sorry. I think I need a little help here. Dean? Hmm? Oh, Dean, come on. Because of what you're doing. It's exciting. It's a good scene. You could... You could still film it. You can just put the thingy on the thing. How would you do it if I wasn't here? There's a lot of times where I just don't get stuff that I need. You are here. That's actually what the truth of it is. Yeah, but I don't want to be in it. That's, like, defeats the whole point of this. You know, Dean, have you ever thought that... your life might be a bit less lonely and a bit more integrated if you took the time to connect with somebody and not just make videos about them? Thank you. And lastly, this picture here shows the car that Mark drove away in. It is a teal Mishibibi. - Mitsubishi. - Mitsi-ibitsy. - And... - Mitsubishi. What is it? Mitsubishi. Mitsubatbitsubisy. Please leave any tips or any helpful comments in the section below. Thank you. Have a great day. Update, guys, I think we found it. It's Marcel's house. It's Marcel Shell's house. Do you think you can get in there right now? - Oh, someone' s coming. - Go. We got to go. Follow for more - celebrity homes. - Just keep going. Huh. Are they... Are they here to help? Mmm... Uh... Don't feel that this is the task force I was hoping for. There's so much nothing. "She's the best." "She"? What? But my dad has pink shoes. So did my grandfather. So cute. Ugh. Peace. Uh, yeah. Obviously peace. Like... What a weird thing to try to test to see if someone else is into. Like, of course I'm into peace. No, sorry, I'm a real war person. No, war actually. I sign all my personal letters, "war." "Let the battle begin. Marcel." Ugh! You know, there's... There is nothing in here about finding them. It's still a group of people, but it's an audience. It's not... It's not a community. There's... Man. Oh! What about the car? What do you mean? Mark drove away in a teal car. So we can go look for it. Like, if we find the car... Yeah, I don't think that's like... That's not the way to... Wow! Okay, so it actually doesn't even seem that big. I mean, it's big but what we just need to do is get up high, and then maybe we'll be able to spot his car. Mmm... What's, like, your mantel? Like, when I need to look out over the whole rug, I get up high. I get up on the mantel. Do you see what I'm saying? 'Cause I can see... Yeah, no, I got it. Yeah. Great, so we'll just head up to the top of this thing, and then we'll be able to see it. I don't think we'll necessarily be able to see it. I actually disagree. I don't think it's a good idea because if we're... if we don't have, like, a plan, then we're just, sort of, flying blind. And we might just waste a lot of time going around in circles. Just put that there... What's that for? It's just in case we get in a fight. We're not gonna get in any fights. You said it was dangerous out there. It's dangerous in a different way, so... And you know what else? I should probably bring this match. You don't need that. Uh, just give me one more minute. I need some sort of a helmet. All right, so you've got the book. You've got a little bit of a raisin, which I really don't think you're gonna finish, but you can go to town. Go to town. Also, you have two drips of... Look over here. What? You have two drips of water. You got an LED flashlight in case the power goes out. You just got to step on it like this. See? See how it... Whoa. What? Sorry. But don't stand right in front of it. Finally, this is the sparkler. What you do is you light this end on fire, and then you step back. This can act as a flare, all right? Why would I need it? That's if you need to signal for help. And Dean's gonna leave you his phone just in case. What? No, I'm not. Who will see the flare? You know what? Now that I'm thinking about it, why don't we just put the colander over you now if you want? All right, how's that? You must let me out of here. Do you want Alan in there with... - Oh, my God. - It's okay. I'm so sorry. It's not a big deal. It's tiny. Whew. I think I'm okay. God, I am so sorry. Oh, my God. How many times a day do you throw up in your car? There's a car. That... That's a teal, but, uh, but that's more like, mmm... I've never seen a lake except for in a picture. Let's do it. Uh, I think I'm gonna cry. It's very beautiful. There's fountains in the lake. And another car. And a car. And a car. And a... There's a lot of places to get tattoos. "Psychic love expert." Wow, I bet... Wow. I could use one of those. What would you want her to say? Uh, I don't know. There's more fish in the sea. Yeah. Yeah. Look, you got a lot of smoocheroonies in your future. - I can see it now. - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Ooh, baby, baby. Ooh, baby. I've seen people kiss on television. I'm so sorry. Up here, yeah? Oh! Is it? Oh, this is it! - This is it. - Let's check it out. Whoa, we're really going up. Up, up, up. This is gonna get high. Mmm-hmm. Wow. What are all the little dots on the hills? Those are houses. All? Yeah. Those are houses like yours. Really? What's all that? That's the rest of the city. Oh, right. Right, right. I... I had no idea. Is this all there is for out there? Mmm-mmm. This is like one part of one big city. And the... But, uh... But there are many big cities. There's lots of them. I mean, you've seen, like, you know, in movies and when it says, like, "Tokyo" and... Uh-huh. ..."Antarctica," those are all different places. Oh. Right. There's so many places that they could be. Do you think it's impossible? I don't think it's impossible. I think that's just, uh... Look at that lady's dress. I know. It's really nice. Thanks for the ride. Yeah. It was fun. Oh. Look at this. They're right on the... They're on the lawn. - They came right up. - Stop it! You wouldn't get it. Hey, guys. Guys. I wanna be first. - Hey. - Stop it! No, no. Um... Would you mind just moving a little bit so we can pull the car in? Arthur. Nan! Nan! Nan! - Nan! - Yes. Oh, my God. Nan, are you... I'm just hurt a little bit... Oh, my God. - ...but I'm okay. - You are? Please just... Just lean your whole self on me. Put all your weight. Don't worry, I can take it. And I guess... Okay. Uh, let's just take it easy. I'm really not sure exactly of what happened because she won't tell me. It could just be that she doesn't remember, and I think that's probably the case. Do you want me to stop? But what I've been able to piece together is that she did get startled, then she fell off the dryer. No! No! Arthur! Sorry. Arthur, come here. - Arthur! - Dean... Arthur! Come here. He... He... He has got to go. I cannot have him here with Connie like this. It's not that I don't like Arthur. Stop, Dean. I'm not kidding. Stop that. No! Oh, my God! - No! No. Off! - Arthur! Arthur! All right. A little bit more. Okay. What's he, uh... What's he being charged with? What? Is he going to the jail? No. Oh. Oh, phew. 'Cause I'm sorry. I thought... I'm going to take him to my wife's house. Uh... You... What? Well, we got separated recently, so that's why I'm staying here. I've been looking for a new place. That's why I'm here. Why wouldn't you tell me this? Uh, I don't know. I didn't think to. Okay. I told you so much. I... So... I'm making a movie about you. I'm not making a movie about me. But you're also here. And I was sharing. You didn't also think to share? And then you're just pointing that around. No. I do think about it. It's not... Why do you... Do you always need to be filming? No. I think you'll be glad I have it, though. We have it. Uh-huh. Hold on. Can we pause the videos that we made so people can't see them, please? Yeah, I can take 'em down. I just can't have more people coming to the house like... Like how it happened today. I can't believe I let this happen. Well, you know, she sleeps a lot. And she hasn't been eating very much. It's looking good. You just gotta keep on moving. You're just one more little... Let me do... I can do it. She's just not able to do a lot of the things that she used to be able to do. - Yeah, that's... - Hurts. ...over again. Sorry, did you shut the window? Yes, I shut the window. Don't help me here. I don't need help. Nana, I'm not even doing anything. Uh! The skater rink, you know, is usually just for the holidays. - Want to try... - How am I looking? You need, uh, maybe once or twice more. Okay. But I set it up just to... ...try to cheer her up a bit. Pump it. Pump it up. Come on, Nan. Up. All right! Nana, pump it up. No, no. No, no, I don't think so. Don't you wanna pump it up? No, no. When I say "jam," you say "Nan." Jam. Well, she won't skate with me anymore, that's for sure. Get into it, a little bit. Stop it. But you know what? She... She really does like the dust. For her, it's special. She's not from here. She's from the garage. That's why she has the accent. It's this wonderful smell. She traveled here by coat pocket when she was really little. I just feel... And so I think it reminds her of home. Nan, look at this. Ready? Oh! Grandma Connie, we need to move! Not that way. This way! Get it out! I'll get the rover! Did I hit it? Not coming over here? Come follow my voice. - Your left or my left. - Your left. At this point, the good days are harder to come by with her. I mean, he's right here. He's on the couch. Yeah, I'm looking right at him. And then the bad days are just actually astounding. Oh! He can jump. There he... There he goes! - Ah, all right, all right. - Yay! I'm trying not to treat her any differently, but it's, uh, keeping me on my toes, I'll tell you that. Wait, I'm gonna close this. Wow, look at this. - You might be interested. - Right? Oh, my gosh. I know. With Lesley Stahl. Oh, my gosh. Ugh. This is a... This is... Oh, my God. - It's amazing, isn't it? - Mmm, yeah, yeah. It's really... We can't show this to Nana Connie. Absolutely not. I mean, I could ask them to keep the crew really small, then they wouldn't make a big footprint. No. No, no, no. Can I ask them how many people would come in? No. What? I'm not taking the risk. - There are a lot... - What is the risk? The risk? Look what already happened to Nana Connie. "We're wondering if you might be interested "to discuss doing an interview piece with Lesley Stahl." We can't do it, Nan. The real Lesley? Yeah, it's the real Lesley. Don't do that. "Please let me know if you're interested. "We'd love to make it work." This recovery is not happening fast enough, and now she has attitude, and I feel bad. We'll just do it once she's feeling better and moving around better. How many of those do you take? Don't take a lot. I'm not taking, 'cause I don't know how... when I'm gonna get another one. This is how I live. We just had to work so hard just to do this, just to find new ways of doing things and learning how to survive on our own. And I guess it's... I don't wanna end up with less... than what I have. I can't make this decision for you, but... No, you're not. I've already made it for myself. ...this is a really good way to find them. I said no. He's no fun to be around, is he? Do... Do you have any corner pieces over there? I want you to do it. No. Nan, no. And we already... We told them no. But don't you want to meet Lesley Stahl? We need quiet, Nana. We don't need a lot of people coming in here and... You don't... You don't need quiet for me. I don't want quiet. Oh. Nope. I think you should do it. You know, we're just flying blind. I don't... I don't even know what we're supposed to be making here. What is this even a picture of? Do you have any blue pieces? He seems...
