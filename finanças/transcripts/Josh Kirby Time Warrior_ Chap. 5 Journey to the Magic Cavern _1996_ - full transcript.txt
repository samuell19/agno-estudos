(MultiCom jingle) (explosions booming) (slow heroic music) - My name is Josh Kirby. I was just your average ninth grader. My biggest problem was getting good grades. And my idea of excitement was racing my bicycle. (bell ringing) Yes! I never thought time would catch up with me. But I couldn't believe that (train whistle blowing) hundreds of years from now, mankind would invent the nullifier, a device capable of controlling or destroying the universe. - [Alien] Prepare for the storm. - A scientist, named Irwin 1138 tried to disassemble and hide the nullifier. But even he couldn't stop. - [Irwin] Dr. Zoetrope! (lasers zapping) - Give me the nullifier. - You're too late, Zoetrope. - It's never too late for me. (engine roaring) - Irwin and Zoetrope have been chasing each other across the time strip trying to be the first to find the nullifier in pieces. This time, they go in to 1995. The place, my front yard. Now, I'm going along for the ride of all time. (laser zapping) (engine roaring) What's going on? Where are we? - I hope you're prepared to do battle young man. This will be war through time and Dr. Zoetrope will take no prisoners. (explosions booming) (dramatic music) (dinosaur roaring) - We've got help from a warrior. - My name is Azabeth Siege. - Ah, she's amazing. (metal clanging) And a magical creature called Prism to show us the way. Together, we're on a quest through time visiting different worlds to fight for the nullifier's pieces. - I'm obviously in the right place and the right time. (lasers zapping) - Because if Zoetrope ever assembles the nullifier, he'll conquer time itself. I've gotta try and save the universe. (heroic action music) I was just a 14 year old kid before my adventure began. But now, I'm Josh Kirby, time warrior. (heroic action music) - [Narrator] On the last chapter of Josh Kirby, Time Warrior. (dramatic music) (explosions booming) - Captain, his forces have had us under constant siege. (explosions booming) - You know what I want. The enslavement of your entire planet. (laughing) - [Azabeth] He's taking the carrier into his tractor beam. - [Josh] He's buying it. - Closer, closer. (explosions booming) (screaming) (screaming) (men grunting and screaming) (screaming) (dramatic music) (music drowns out speakers) (electricity zapping) (screaming) - Jumping meteors, it's the fifth component. - What is that? (screaming) - The nullifier components, they're gone! - (mumbles)? These are a delicacy on my planet. - Ouch! - Holy! - That didn't tickle, you know. - Irwin? - Yeah. - Irwin, uh, what's happening? - Fascinating. Fungi. - [Josh] Yeah, yeah, they look like they could be fun guys. - No no, not fun guys, fungi. I mean, parasitic bacterial organisms that thrive mainly on moisture and nitrogen. - Yeah, yeah they're mushrooms. I hate mushrooms, I hate 'em. Except on pizza. (mysterious music) - Oh beloved furry one. All great and powerful. You have finally come to deliver us from the Muncher. - Irwin, Irwin, why are they praying to Prism? - Apparently they must think Prism is some form of deity. - Yeah, right, the furry one. - Yes. Now be careful with Prism, mushroom folk. He's one of a kind. (chanting) - Thank you for delivering the furry one back to his rightful place. - Azabeth. - Don't worry, Josh, she's probably just a little bit woozy from the air down here, that's all. - Irwin, Irwin, that mushroom she ate. - It could be that these fungi aren't meant for consumption by carbon-based life forms. - You mean she's poisoned? - That could very well be the case, yes. - It's not my fault. She took a bite out of me. This is too much. - She won't die, will she? I mean, she only took one bite. - Well organisms have different tolerances relative to a dose of poison. The line between no effect at all and a lethal dose can be very thin. - It's alright. I'm better now. - Okay. Irwin, we've got to find an antidote. - Yes but where, how? - I don't know, there's gotta be a way! - It is a tragedy to happen to such a loyal disciple of the furry one. Our king will know what to do. Come, come. (grand music) (trumpets playing) (grand music) - Hello, Porcini. What is the meaning of bringing these strange beings into my royal chamber? - Lord Truffle. These are the furry one's followers. The signorina, she took a bite out of one of your loyal subjects. Now she's very sick. I tell them maybe you know what to do. - Lord Truffle. The furry one is most bummed out at the illness of his loyal follower. So could you help her? - I summon the royal doctor. (trumpets playing) (whimsical music) - Please to say ah. - I'm not about to let you stick that evil torture device in my mouth. - Azabeth, relax, it's just a tongue depressor. - My tongue is depressed enough, Josh Kirby. - Azabeth, let him look, he's just trying to help. - Ah. - Ah. (tutting) - [Josh] What's wrong? - Teeth full of cavities. Must brush more. (laughing) - Yeah, yeah that's really funny. Look, what's wrong with her? - Please understand I am only humble shroom physician. - Doc, hey doc. You think you can take a look at this? - You took bite? - Yes. - Oh no. Very bad. Only one antidote. Must taste from one shroom's spores, Puffball. - So where do we find this Puffball guy? - Oh, I'm very sorry but Puffball is no longer with us. - Puffball's been snatched by the Muncher. - Then we'll just have to snatch him back. - What manner of creature is this Muncher? - Oh, it is a most horrible, horrible beast. He traps and eats shrooms for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Without stop. - Muncher first appeared at Dream Cavern. Was once most beautiful place. Biggest tourist attraction of all of Shroom Town. But now off limits. - It has turned the entire shroom economy into a shambles. - Now it's called Nightmare Hollow. Nobody go there no more. - But surely it's just a matter of time before this monster, Muncher, do you call him? Tracks you down here. - Yeah, that's why we've gotta find him first. Look, we'll find Puffball, get the antidote for Azabeth, and get rid of this Muncher thing all at the same time. - Not a difficult mission when armed with a 25th century scientific marvel such as my power staff. (beeping) Blast! I must have forgotten to recharge the firing mechanism before I left the time pod. - Well please, you've gotta help us. You've gotta lead us to this Nightmare Hollow. - Oh great furry one. (squeaking) Accept my most humble apologies. I cannot accede to the wishes of your groveling servants. The hall to Nightmare Hollow is sure shroom suicide. - [Shroom] Yes. - No one who goes there, shroom or not, will ever return alive. - Look, we're going, with or without your help, and the furry one's coming with us. - Boy, you forget yourself! You are talking to the ruler of all shrooms! - Hey! - The audience is over. We have much more important business on our agenda. - What'd you do to Prism? - I have put the furry one to sleep for today. He needs his rest as all of us below ground do. Guards! - [Guards] Yes my lord. - Take the furry one's followers to the grotto for their own protection. (dramatic music) - Porcini! - I'm sorry Josh, you must do as Lord Truffle says. Lord, may we not let the furry one's disciples go after Puffball? It could mean the signorina's life. - How can you ask that, Porcini? You know that the Muncher has seriously decimated our population. You also know that I am cultivating new subjects in the royal cave gardens even as we speak. Our numbers are few. Are you asking me to risk antagonizing the Muncher just when we've begun to rebuild? - No, no, that is, I understand you highness but you see-- - But, but nothing, Porcini. The issue is closed. - Yes lord. (dramatic music) - Along with you, don't tarry. - I must rest, Josh Kirby. - She's burning up. - Yeah. We've gotta get out of here! - Not the best of occasions for your time powers to be in rejuvenation mode. (bubbling) - Ah, oh, ha ha. Ay, ay. Ah. - Doctor Shiitake! - Ay! - I must ask you for a very great favor. - Shiitake will see if he can grant it. - The furry one's followers, they need our help. Lord Truffle forbids it but I know he's wrong. - I agree with you, Porcini. - You do? - Have been considering the same issue myself. Come to same conclusion as you. - That's wonderful! I will lead them to Nightmare Hollow myself! - Nightmare Hollow? - But they must take the furry one with them too. - No problem! Shiitake can get furry one released by telling Lord Truffle furry one needs full medical examination. - Ooh, that's terrific. (laughing) You get the furry one and meet me at the grotto. - Hai! (exciting music) - You two are dismissed, go get us some chow. - Chow time! (whimsical music) - Hey. - Porcini! - I come to lead you to Puffball and Nightmare Hollow. How's the signorina? - I'm alright. - Prism! Wait, but he's still asleep! - Yes, I could not wake. Shroom king sleep spores especially strong. - When will he wake up? - Could happen soon. Or not so soon. What will happen, until then Shiitake would be honored if you carry furry one in Shiitake's papoose. - Yeah. (coughing) - This is for you to eat. - What is it? - Beet root. Beet root make you better, but listen carefully. Work for 12 yabbadabbas only. - 12 yabbadabbas? How are we supposed to know how long that is? - When sand runs out her time is up. (suspenseful music) - Is there any way you can give us a couple more? - Afraid not. Beet root ancient, very rare. If you not find Puffball before time runs out, she fall into deep sleep, never wake up. - Josh, look. I know you care deeply about Azabeth Siege as I do. Sometimes you've got to look at the big picture. There is still the universe to save. - What good is the universe without your friends? Besides, this Muncher thing, it eats shrooms. Probably people. And I'll bet it eats nullifier components. - Point well taken. Now if the nullifier components brought us here, the pieces must be lost somewhere in this cavern. - Let us go my friends. Time is of the essence. (coughing) (mysterious music) - I must rest, Josh Kirby. - No, later Azabeth. Right now every minute counts. - Water. So much water. - Wait, Azabeth, Azabeth wait! Where do you see water? - It's everywhere. - Oh she's hallucinating, Josh. Must be a side effect of the poison. - Oh, mamma mia, what's happening to the furry one? - Oh, even when he's asleep Prism is sniffing the nullifier component. It must be this way. - Wait, we've got to save Azabeth! - Relax. This won't take long, Josh. Moisture on the ceiling. Brr, clammy. Ah. Eureka! Ha ha ha! One down, five to go. - You were right, Azabeth. There was water here. - Not only that, but this way, she is a shortcut. She'll take us to Nightmare Hollow in half of the time. - Excellent! - After you! - No, after you! - Gratzi signore. (singing in Italian) - Porcini! You're a shroom of many talents. - And I sing too. (laughing) - The bells are ringing, they're ringing. - What'd she say, Josh? - I don't know, something about bells. - Have courage, Josh. This ordeal is almost over. (suspenseful music) - Yeah, yeah I hope so Irwin. I really hope so. (mysterious music) - I don't believe it. - You don't believe what? - [Dingdong] Who's out there? - It's us, I mean it's me, Porcini. Mamma mia, little Dingadong! We thought you were taken by the Muncher. - The name is Ding! (dramatic music) Your holiness, I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy. How come you asleep? - Dingadong, not now. You can grovel later. Right now you must join me to help the furry one and his servants rescue the lost ones. This girl here, she's sick. If we don't find your daddy Puffball soon, she's gonna get sicker. Hey, by the way your mama, she's worried sick about you. - Yeah, well I know she's been worried about Dad too ever since he disappeared. Maybe if anyone had the nerve to form a search party, there might be some shred of hope! - Hey Porcini, who's your pal? - What's it to ya, freak? - Freak, who you calling freak? You're the talking mushroom. (bells ringing) - Oh oh, Josh, Josh, this is Dingadong. Please excuse him. His papa disappeared in Nightmare Hollow last week. His papa is Puffball, the same mushroom we seek, eh. - Oh, that lousy Muncher. I'm gonna turn him into shroom food if it's the last thing I do! - Oh! You're too young for a vendetta, Dingadong. - Think so? I'm gathering enough ammunition to get the Muncher all by myself. - Very brave, my boy, but also very foolish. A well thought out plan is the best weapon you can have. - Those are my plans right there. That's plan A, that's plan B, and this is plan C. - Not bad. But you may want to discard some of the heavier stones. Although they appear more threatening they can throw off your aim and in the end be less effective than one perfectly aimed small sharp rock. - Cool. I never had that effect on a female before. - Now look she's sick. We've got to find the Muncher and your father in, well, in however many yabbadabbas this is. - I'll show you the way. It can get pretty dark up ahead. And there are millions of passages leading every which way. And my ringing will come in handy, and then we can really kick some Muncher butt. (exciting music) - I would be proud to kick some Muncher butt alongside you, young Dingdong. - Yeah, me too pal. - Ah. (mysterious music) (coughs) - Come on, hold it up. - I thank you, Josh Kirby, I just need to catch my breath. Oh the sky, out of the sky, look, look out. - What's wrong with her? - Azabeth Siege is hallucinating. - Sure, but then they happen for real. - Yeah that's right. They're like premonitions. She head the bells ringing and then we met Dingdong. - What does she mean by out of the sky? - I don't know, I guess we keep looking up. - What is the source of your ringing, little Dingdong? - I get it from my dad's side of the family. We're bell shrooms. - Oh. Are you capable of controlling it? - I'm trying to learn, it's not easy. I'm only 13. Older shrooms can make all kinds of rings whenever they want to. - Bell shrooms are most respected among our people. They can make a pleasing music or sound the alarm when danger threatens. - I'm alright now, we can go on. (chirping) - [Dingdong] Awesome. - [Irwin] Look, Prism's on the trail of another nullifier component. - He's almost better at it asleep then he is awake. Irwin, we don't have much time! - This won't take long. - Yeah, that's what you said last time. There's nothing here. - It's impossible. Prism's coat of many colors-- - Never lies, I know. But maybe he's malfunctioning. There's a first time for everything. - That's the 11th code of Kang. - Oh, remember, we gotta be watching the sky. (burbling) - Irwin, are you getting shorter or am I getting taller? - No, we're exactly the same. - Oh, it's quicksand! Get out! (ringing) Everybody stay back, it's dangerous! Stay back! - Quick, take my hand! Come on, pull! Hurry, something! Irwin grab hold of this, quick! - No, no, it's too valuable to risk! (groaning) - [Josh] Come on! - Goodbye, Josh, Azabeth, little Prism. It's been wonderful knowing you. - [Josh] No, don't let go! Don't let go! (ringing) Help! Are you sure we're supposed to be looking in the sky? - You have to let go of his hand. I'm not strong enough to pull you both up. - No, I can't! Just let go! - You must! - No, I won't! - Josh Kirby, I refuse to let you die this way! - Stand back! - [Josh] Porcini! - I got it, give me your hand! (mumbles) - Irwin, come on, just a little more, keep it going! (panting) (coughing) - What's that? - It's another nullifier component. It stands to reason. If all the pieces were strewn here during the cave in, then there must be pieces that are hidden from plain sight. (laughing) - How'd you manage to pull us both out? - Don't think just because we're small we're not strong. - That certainly was a close call. - Yeah, I'd say. - We could have missed finding this nullifier component. - Hey Porcini, does the furry one show any signs of waking up? - Afraid not. He's still in furry one dreamland. - Great. So how old are you anyway, Ding? - 15. - Oh yeah? I'm 14. - Yeah, you look tall for your age. - Maybe here. Back home I'm kinda average. So I guess you're pretty worried about your dad, huh? - Yeah. Even though he really bugs me sometimes. I told him once I wished he'd go away. (sentimental music) Gee, I really didn't mean it. - Sure. We all say things we're sorry for later. - Well, my dad can be a real pain in the cap. The funny thing is now I miss him bugging me. - Yeah, I know what you mean for sure. - We should move on, my friends. (exciting music) - Josh. - Whoa! - Porcini. (zapping) (ominous music) - Where am I? I'm obviously underground. Hello, what's this? Ah, well I'm obviously in the right place and the right time. Yeah. - Azabeth is different looking than you. Do all females of your kind look like her? - Not really, but kind of. She come from, well the best way I can describe it is an alternate future. - Future, you mean another time? - Yeah. Azabeth's from a twisted version of the 33rd century. Irwin's from what will hopefully once again be the 25th century, and I'm from the strictly legitimate 20th century. - How can that happen? - Well we have pieces of what is called the nullifier component. It's powerful enough to destroy the universe. Irwin's been traveling in a time pod he invented to try and recover all the pieces. And I've been helping him. - You've been helping him destroy the universe? Why? - Oh no, no. I've been helping him keep this other guy, Dr. Zoetrope, from getting all the pieces. See Zoetrope's crazy enough to want to reassemble the nullifier and destroy the world. Irwin chased one of the components to my backyard and I kinda got stuck helping him. For a while it was kind of a race against time. And through time. To beat Zoetrope in getting all the pieces. And now Zoetrope's got 'em we've still got to get all the pieces before he can retrace our steps through time and restore the natural order of the time stream. - [Dingdong] So that's how you met Azabeth? - [Josh] Yeah. We just came from her own time where she helped lead her people in a slave revolt. - Wow. - Yeah we've been on so many adventures. We rode dinosaurs in medieval England, escaped from a giant mutant kid who had us trapped as human pets. - Zowie! After all you've been through the Muncher must not scare you at all! - No way! Nothing scares me now. (buzzing) Whoa! Ah! (ominous music) - Stingers! - These sting like bees back home, only worse! - We must be near their nest. There! - Why are they only coming after me? - Stingers sting the first organism and then they sting until that organism is dead. Then they go after the next one. - Sting me til I'm dead? You gotta be kidding me! (mumbles) - If we get far enough away from their nest they usually leave you alone. - Usually? That's just great. (speaking Italian) - Oh, that was a close one for you, Josh Kirby. - Yeah, you're telling me. - We should press on, people. - Azabeth, can you walk? - Yes. - Azabeth is right about looking up. I wonder what's next? - The walls. (mysterious music) Pictures on the walls. The story. The story is true. - What can she mean? - Paintings on walls. - It could mean anything. - I'm not so sure, mister. Me, I like to know what's on the itinerary myself. - Painting on the wall. - Hey, the wall is painted! - Holy moly. - Fascinating. - Ooh, it's like the catacombs beneath the ancient city of Mushroom. (ominous music) - Shroom, shrooms. What is a shroom? (growling) - What does this mean? - It's like a caveman painting. Only with UFOs and aliens. - You can't see the forest for the trees, boy. The centerpiece of this entire painting is the nullifier device. - This whole thing has gotten really weird. - Dingadong, this is much bigger than our little shroom world has ever seen before. - Irwin, look. There's another one over here. More than one. Irwin, there's got to be more than one nullifier. - Impossible. - See for yourself! - Well this painting appears to be geniune. Let's time date it. (beeping) It dates at 12 million years old. - But if there's another nullifier device, where could it be? - I don't know. This whole painting belongs to an alien culture that's completely unknown to me. It has a history no one knows. - I bet the furry one knows. - Hey, what do you mean Dingadong? - Doesn't anyone but me notice something about the furry one and these little guys? (magical music) - Great jumping ions, I think the little bell shroom is on to something. - You know there is a shroom legend about such a thing like this painting. All the mushrooms know the sacred story. The furry one, he come here many, many years ago and he come from far, far away. They hold in their hands the secrets of the universe. And only they know how to use the secrets. Hey, it is the furry ones that keep everything in order! - In order? - They make the mushroom kingdom what it is today. They keep things going in the right way. You know, like the, um, (mumbles), the progress of things! The water, the water, it comes down to us from the stream over there so we grow and the prosper down here. Each day we know there is a next day. And like that. Capisce? - You mean the time continuum. Don't you see what he's saying? He's saying that the furry ones established linear time on this planet, without which you would have no progress. Because in random time it's impossible to build tomorrow on today. - Irwin, are you saying that Prism is the key to the secret to the universe? - No Josh. Not the key but a key. This whole picture is like, like pages in a book. Look. On this page you have the furry ones abducting the nullifier from these alien people and here you have the boat which has always been a symbol for the transfer of knowledge from one age to the other. He's bringing the knowledge to another people. And here, the furry ones have hundreds if not thousands of nullifiers. While on the last page. - Yeah, what about the last page? - The last page is being written now, Josh. - This is sacrilege! How dare you speak this way about the furry one! You hairless ignorant smoother skins should be ashamed of yourselves. - I'm reminded of the very first code of Kang. - Yeah, what's that one again? - Things are not always as they appear. - You're right. (mysterious music) - On the other side of that bridge is Nightmare Hollow. - The nether regions. - The evil place. - The epitomal image of Dante's hellish inferno. - Yeah so in other words we gotta watch our butts. (suspenseful music) - [Porcini] That's it, that's it, come on now, that's it. Hurry up Josh, come on! - Josh Kirby, run! - Oh no! - Come on, keep climbing, come on! Don't let go. Come on, that's it, you're doing good, look at us, come on. That's it Josh, come on. Come on, boy! Grab her hand! Come on. Pull, pull! That's it. Come on everyone! - Well, that always looked fun on Nintendo. - It was too close for comfort. - I, I agree. - You don't need to know what a yabbadabba is to know that Azabeth hasn't got much time. - Look, Prism's sniffing another nullfier component. Can't be too far off. - Neither can the Muncher. (mysterious music) - We are in the heart of Nightmare Hollow now. This is Muncher territory for sure. - What makes you say that? - I just feel it. - The second code of Kang tells us a warrior must always trust his instincts. - When did this Muncher monster begin to make its presence felt by you mushroom people? - It seems like forever. You don't measure things the same like time when you live so scared. - Has anyone ever seen this Muncher? - No one who came back. - [Dingdong] I saw it. - Dingadong, you saw the Muncher take your daddy? Oh that's terrible. - It all happened so fast. I tried. But I couldn't do anything. I kept yelling for my dad to follow me but it was like he was in some sort of trance. I felt it too. I was practicing my ringing when it all came upon us. That's how come I think I wasn't taken with the others. - Hypnosis. It must use hypnosis to attract its prey. - That must be why you were able to escape. If you were ringing, your mind must have been so full of emotion that it couldn't be lured into the Muncher's trap. - That's right. You were so busy worrying about your father you didn't have time to do anything else. - Wow. So my dad saved me? - In a manner of speaking, yes. - But all I did was panic. And cover myself with moss. I don't know what happened after that. It got real quiet and then everybody was gone. - You were very brave, young Dingdong. And you couldn't have done anything except get munched yourself. But you behaved as a warrior and now you're prepared for the battle. - Warrior? I'm no warrior. All I did was hide and run away. - He who fights and flees the fray lives to fight another day. - By any chance would that be a code of Kang? - Number six. (mysterious music) - Whoa, Josh. You alright? - Yeah. I'm fine, I just tripped on something. - How big did you say this Muncher is? - That's his footprints, you figure it out. - Oh no, not a footprint. I've had quite enough of monster, giants, and mutants for one lifetime, thank you very much. (suspenseful music) - Everybody, look at the furry one's hair! - Prism? You've done it again! - That's right, the Muncher must have stepped on one of the nullifier components. (chuckling) - [Irwin] Thank heaven they're indestructible. - I just noticed something. Every time we pick one of these things up, something go wrong. It's like they are jinxed or booby-trapped. (pulsing tone) - Porcini, that's absolute coincidence. It's totally unscientific. There's just no pattern here. In due time you could establish a pattern but twice is mere coincidence. (buzzing) What's that noise? (growling) (screaming) Don't look at its eyes! - Prepare to meet your maker, Muncher! - No, Dingdong! Azabeth, no, no, Azabeth, not you too. Azabeth, Azabeth, no, Azabeth, no! Azabeth, no! (shouting) (hitting) I know, we gotta get to its eyes. It's the only way to make it powerless! - Basta, wait a minute, boy! - Hold back, Joshua! You'll never reach up to its face. (shushing) (mysterious music) (groaning) - You think you're so smart. Eh, little shrooms? - Who the heck are you? - Oh! (mumbles) Boy you nearly... You, how did you find me? - I'll ask the questions. Game over. What are you trying to pull anyway? Where is everyone, huh? (shushing) What have you done with them? - Shh, I can explain everything. Okay, take it easy young man. You see, it's really quite an amusing thing. You see it's really quite amusing. - Over here, take a look at this. - What have we here? - Oh, ha! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Colonel Beauregard T. Damon. Colonel Beauregard T. Damon. Master shop, intergalactic entrepreneur, voyager, inventor, and patron of the arts. And you are? - It's ingenious. This Muncher is actually an incredibly sophisticated animatronic puppet? - Yes, yes! It's a creation of my own, in fact. It's quite effective in trapping alien species. - Hang on little Dingadong! I'm on my way! - Look. Those alien species are our friends. - Oh. You see, everybody's fine. - Who's this guy? - This is Colonel Damon. He built this thing. (rumbling) - The Muncher isn't a monster, it's a mechanical puppet. - Yeah, we figured that out. - Hey, where's my dad and the others? - Yeah, where is everyone? We're looking for a shroom called Puffball and we need him right now. - Well I will take you to them. It's not far. Mind your heads. (mysterious music) Won't be long now. - What are you collecting these alien species for anyway? (beeps) Pets? Slaves? - My stars, no, nothing so primitive. No, see I feature the natural wonders of the universe in my very own intergalactic circus. Ha! - Oh, an intergalactic circus. - Yes, yeah well it's my primary venture into the world of entertainment, presently. I travel the cosmos in my little chuck wagon collecting various creatures and bringing them together under one tent! - So it's like a freak show! - Yes! No, no, no. Hello, youth. No see my big top travels from one planet to the next, educating. E-D-U-C-A-T-- - I-N-G. - I-N-G, right, educating alien cultures as to the vast variety, the possibilities of nature. Yeah. - So where are you from? - Well, well I've planted myself in every corner of the universe at one time or another, but I was born in the United Federation of American Colonies. - You mean the United States of America. - What? The USA? That's ancient history, son. What time machine did you step out of? Next thing you're gonna tell me is that you've never heard of the talking ape era of the 21st century. (laughing) - Oh no, I've heard of that. - Come come come! (clapping) I think you'll find this quite relieving. (mysterious music) (whimsical circus music) (beeps) - Oh, daylight! Oh am I glad to see you. What are you doing here? - Center of most worlds I've been to harbor an internal sun. Jules Verne was right. - Azabeth, are you okay? (suspenseful music) No, it can't be too late. There's still some sand left. - Every estimate has a margin of error, Josh. - Josh, I-- - [Irwin] She's slipping rather quickly, Josh. - Where's Puffball? Where is he? - He's in there. - Bring him here, quick! Hurry! Azabeth, Azabeth, wake up. Don't fall asleep, you'll be okay. (ringing) - Pops! - Hello son. How are you? - Azabeth, Azabeth! We're here, look, Puffball's right here. Azabeth, no. - I'm afraid it's too late. She's slipped into a terminal deep sleep just like Dr. Shiitake said she might. - On behalf of all of the mushrooms, Josh, I want to say that we are so sorry that we are the cause of your sorrow. - No. No, we've got to do something! Look, you say you're the smartest man in the universe, so just do something! - Sorry Josh, there's some problems even I can't solve. If I could alter the situation, I would. I'm just a scientist, not a magician. I can't perform miracles. - I don't need a miracle. All I need is a few minutes! They were taken from me and I'm gonna get 'em back. Just a few minutes. All I need is a few minutes. Just five minutes, come on. (exciting music) (buzzing) Five minutes. - Josh! Josh, what in the name of the supreme prefect? Great jumping ions! You're summoning up your own time storm! Josh, be careful! - Five minutes. Five minutes. - [Porcini] Josh, Puffball, hurry! - That tastes terrible. - It's okay Azabeth, medicine's supposed to taste bad. - What are you trying to do, poison me? - Just now, I was somehow able to turn back time. - What? No one's ever been able to create a time storm before without using a chronal displacement device of some sort. - Yeah, well I did. I mean, Azabeth was almost out of time, I had to do something. - You did it! It worked! - Yeah. - Stupefying. (bright music) - It's humble but it's mine. (groaning) - Irwin. Zoetrope. - He doesn't seem to recognize us. Anything else for that matter. - (speaking foreign language) It's me! Chantarelle! Speak to me! What's wrong with you all? - They cannot hear you. See they respond to only me and my instructions. (ominous music) I am so glad you've provided me with this opportunity to have you join their ranks. - What a dirty, rotten-- - Sticks and stones may break my bones but names really tick me off. (laser firing) - Porcini! - What did you do to my dad you mad, mad circus freak? (laser firing) (groaning) - Don't worry, don't worry. I'm only interested in mushrooms for my circus. Besides, I've only stunned them. Once I reprogram their minds, they'll fit right in with the others. - You are nothing but a coward and a phony. First you hide behind your mechanical rat and now you try and hide behind your blaster. - Young lady, you are really beginning to try my patience. - Colonel, couldn't we come to some sort of arrangement? - Hmm. Well, your furry little ward there would make a most excellent attraction. Never seen a species like him. Yes, yes, bravo I say! Bravissimo, bravace, alright! Hand him over. - That's impossible. We haven't finished collecting all the nullifier components. But I can fully appreciate your interest in my little friend. Perhaps when he's fulfilled his function. - Irwin, you're kidding, right? - Well, it's a shroom show this season anyway. Too late to introduce a new attraction now. I can't believe my luck. This one here make a most excellent strong man. Golly gosh, now I will have a father and son dinging act. (mimicking bells ringing) (curious music) - Fourth and fifth nullifier components. - Into, into the cage with them, boys! - I demand that you set these shrooms free immediately. You have no right to keep them in bondage. I have spent my entire life fighting this very kind of slavery on my own planet and it makes me sick! (kicks) - My hand! You little hussy. - Set them free, Colonel. Or I'll zap you into a state of unconsciousness. - Oh, pshaw. - Break the spell, Colonel. - You shoot me and your fungal friends will spend their days in a state of catatonia. And you'll never be able to de-hypnotize them. - Oh yeah? I'll think of something. - Go ahead then. Shoot. - Don't say I didn't warn you. (buzzing) - Oh darn, I forgot to tell you. The plasma blaster's grip is programmed to respond only to my hand print, oh! I've been robbed. You, ugly! You, you, you! Block the exits! Nobody gets out! (mysterious music) (chanting) - Where's Irwin? - Return my property, thieving septuagenarian. You have no choice but to surrender, sir. My troops have you surrounded. - It's you who have robbed me. These are the objects I have risked life and limb to find and I won't be waylaid by the likes of you. - Tough toenails! Sir, they are mine now to show to the universe. - Colonel, if we don't get all those pieces there won't be any universe. - Oh, what's that supposed to mean? - I won't return them, Colonel. - Well, in that case I guess it's pointless to argue with you. - Oh. I knew at heart you were a reasonable human being. - I just have to shoot you instead. (intense music) (laser firing) - Must make haste. - [Crowd] No one gets out. - What about Dingdong and Porcini? - We can't just leave them there. - Irwin, what do we do? - Never having been surrounded by zombie mushrooms before, I have no idea. - Oh! - Pop, it's me, Dingdong! What are you doing? These are my friends! Please, snap out of it! (chirping) - It's the furry one! - [Mushrooms] We pledge our undying loyalty oh furry one. - Prism's colors are bringing them out of hypnosis. - [Mushrooms] We pledge our undying loyalty oh furry one. We pledge our undying loyalty oh furry one. We pledge our undying loyalty oh furry one. (mystical music) - We told you the furry one was great. - Pops! (ringing) - Ding! Oh my boy! - Irwin, how could you even consider trading Prism away? - Josh, Colonel Damon is a traveler to distant galaxies. With him, Prism has a much better chance of getting back to his own planet. - Well yeah, I never thought of it that way. - It's a good thing we now know what a lowly worm-gutted villain Colonel Damon really is. - Ahem. He can hear you. Put them back in the cages. What have you done? - Your slaver days are over, Damon. - My talent. You've deprogrammed them. Months of work, ruined. Okay. - You torture your last shroom, paisan. You're gonna go on your space rocket and you're gonna bring back all the shrooms you kidnapped. We go with you to make sure. - I will return all your people to you. Think I wanted to resort to violence and mind control? - You're power hungry, Colonel, it's a disease. Believe me, I know. - Okay, okay, so I made some faulty management decisions. My entertainment empire spans the universe. All I ever wanted to do was bring the mysteries of nature to the underprivileged youngsters of the cosmos. Was that so wrong? Mommy! - It doesn't sound like such a bad life. Traveling around the cosmos. - Hey, how do you know? You never even been above ground. None of us have. - That's just what I'm saying. It could be a great adventure. To explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life, new civilizations, to boldly go where no shroom has gone before. - It's an exciting life, that's for certain. - I'm thinking about going. - Me too. - But he will exploit you, treat you as slaves, imprison you. - Yeah. But they wouldn't be slaves if they were paid. - Profit sharing? Never. - You must not let this scoundrel take advantage! (dramatic music) If you fail to give the shrooms a fair deal, Damon, I will personally hunt you down and take their percentage from your worthless hide. As the 20th code of Kang ordains, blood debts must be repaid in blood. - Blood? - Azabeth, is that really the 20th code of Kang? - Of course it is. - I agree, I agree! I will negotiate, just don't hurt me. - Alright then. It's settled. Badabing, badaboom. - What about Zoetrope? - Oh yes, Dr. Zoetrope. He must still be under the spell of the Muncher. Lucky for us the Colonel doesn't know who he is. - Ah, well Colonel, what are you planning on doing with that big guy over there? - The rove rover? - [Josh] Yeah. - Caught him just today in the catacombs. Put up quite a fight, nearly crunched my Muncher. Robots are yesterday's news most places these days. But trade him to a robot wrestling team for Maldorphian red pod. - A robot wrestling team, huh? That's pretty cool. (light music) - I just wanted to thank you for helping our people. And for reuniting me with my boy. - And you should be especially proud of your son, Mr. Puffball. We would have been lost without him. Young Dingdong is a very brave and resourceful warrior. - I can't wait to tell the kids about the stinger attacks. The quicksand and fighting with the Muncher! And about this beautiful cool warrior girl who taught me all about life and the 21 codes of Kang. - Whoa, wait a second! Maybe you should tell your old man first, huh? (giggles) - Maybe when you get older, Pop. (laughing) Goodbye, Azabeth Siege. I don't know if I'll ever meet anyone like you again. (grand music) - And I know I will never meet another mushroom warrior as brave as you, young Dingdong. - I'm no good at saying goodbyes, so we just say ciao, okay? - Ciao. - Yes indeed, Porcini. - And you too furry one. I would be honored if I could shake your paw. (chirps) (exciting music) I'll never wash this hand again. (laughing) (gentle music) - How do we find the last components, and what do we do then? - Then the universe is saved and I'll restore you and Azabeth back to your respective times. Return to mine a demigod. - What if you can't do it? I mean bring us back, that is. - Oh don't worry, I'll find a way. Or perhaps even you will. Josh. When you used your time warrior powers to summon up a one-person time storm. How did you know you could do it? Did you just feel it innately? - Well at the moment it was all I wanted to do. It was like I knew what had to happen and I knew I had to make it happen. Now look, this may sound crazy, but I knew I could do it. I just knew. I guess when someone really wants to change something they find the power to make it happen. Of course, that's not always true. Some things nobody can change. I guess that's the way it's supposed to be. - Yes, it's very sensible, Josh. You have a good head on your shoulders. - Thanks. - Goodnight, Josh. - Goodnight, Irwin. (gentle snoring) (sentimental music) (buzzing) - No, no, not again! (dramatic music) (zapping) Zoetrope! - Toss me the nullifying component. - No, never! Whoa! - Josh, it's too heavy, Josh. It's weighing you down, Josh. Toss me the nullifying component so I can pull you up. - No, I'd rather see it lost forever then in your hands! - Listen to me, Joshua. If you drop the nullifying component you will most certainly doom the future of all mankind. You may as well take a chance with me. (zaps) (dramatic music) (shouts) - I'm warning you, Dr. Zoetrope. I've got powers too. Special, special time warrior powers that you can't handle. I can bend time without a tin suit. - Then use those powers to finally see the truth. Irwin 1138's been manipulating you all along. - Your evil lies make me sick! We both know Irwin's been trying to save the universe from you. - No Joshua. He's tricked you into believing that when it's been he who wants to destroy the future. - You're insane! You've been doing everything in your power to try and crush us! - Is that why I saved your life just now? If you still don't believe me, Josh, go ahead. Touch your fingers to my head and time probe my mind. - What do you mean? - Pull the past from out of my mind. You can do it. You're a time warrior, Josh. (suspenseful music) (zaps) - I was able to recalibrate Colonel Damon's blaster to match my own pawprint. Are you alright, Josh? - Yeah, I'm fine, but you didn't have to shoot him! - Ah, forget his evil lies. Trying to turn you against me is child play for an evil genius like him. - Irwin? Let me probe your time memories. - Never! (intense music) Hand over the final nullifying component now Josh! - No. No not until I know the truth! - Please, Josh. After all we've been through together, don't force me to blast you to smithereens! (warping music) - [Narrator] On the next chapter of Josh Kirby Time Warrior! - He's no one's friend, Josh! - Quiet, you! (blasts) - [Josh] Dr. Zoetrope! - Hand the final nullifying component over to me now. Before I disintegrate Azabeth! (zapping) - Irwin, come back! - I've won, I've won, I've won! - Without a time travel device we're stuck here in the center of the earth, powerless to stop him. - But there must be something we can do. A warrior can't just give up. (laughing maniacally) - You said it yourself. I'm a time warrior. (buzzing) - It's working! - I got it! - I knew you could do it, Josh Kirby! What in the name of Kang is that? - It's an energy distortion of the time stream. A time wave. - Look out! (screaming) - We did it! This is it! - I did it! I'm back! - We are still in the 20th century. But we're six inches tall. Well, I gotta go. I've gotta try and save the universe. - My friends are all gone thanks to you. - Good riddance. Prepare to join them! (blasting) (exploding) No! (exploding) (exciting music) (light music) (MultiCom jingle)
