He's booked for the next three days. Even if you increase the blood flow by 10%, you'll nearly double the sensation, and with the proper setup, you can do 25 of these a day within a year. It's viable and it's strictly therapeutic. You sure there'd be this kind of demand for it, though? Are you kidding? It's a goldmine. It's the same setup as a hernia clinic. You just, in, out, snip, tuck. It's no big deal, no added costs. This is a simple bypass. You've used these Teflon arteries before. - Yeah. - You'd be better off with an organic graph, wouldn't you? What do you think, Harry? - Roe, that's for you. - Have you done anything with - lab animals? - Thanks. There's nothing here. What do you think? Is it ethical? Hey, the plane's here. What kind of Mickey - Are you guys ready? Mouse question was that? Jesus Christ. He's tired, D.J. He's been laying numbers like that since he got here yesterday. What the hell is wrong with him? He's tired. Well, that doesn't give him the right to treat me like shit. I mean, if there is - Hey, Donnie, take it easy. A demand for it, what the - Let it ride. Hell's wrong with filling it? Get an extra cup of coffee? You know, you might be able to franchise out this. What? This operation. You need a name for it if you're gonna sell franchises. Something catchy yet tasteful. Well, not too tasteful. I mean after all, you wanna sell the thing. And how are you gonna advertise a little thing like this without offending public decency? It's a word of mouth kind of thing. It'll sell, don't worry, it'll sell. Are you really sure? Sure I'm sure. Listen, who wouldn't pay for a bigger dick? Come on, we're not all these angels. You haven't seen the man since last year. Take it easy on him. He went to a lot of trouble organizing this thing. Have you thought about the offer yet? What? The institute. Come in with us, Harry. That way at least I'll get to see your ugly puss once in awhile. I never see you anymore. No one sees you anymore. Look, we've been all over this before. Lakeview lets met run neurology my way, and that's the way I like it. So don't start. Who's starting? Who's starting? If you wanna work your guts out for peanuts, be my guest. But let me point out a few things to you, sir. A, Lakeview is well known snake pit not fit for human habitation. B, you're a first class surgeon. C, they need you. D, one of these mornings you're gonna wake up needing them and then F, they've got you by the balls. And what have you got to show for it? A lot of worthless glory. Those bastards at Lakeview don't give a damn if you burn yourself out, Harry. They'll just get another genius with an inflated ego and burn him out. I'll take my chances. Like Marty, he cracked up doing what you're doing. Well, Marty had other problems. He was one of the best surgeons I ever saw. He still is. He's a juice artist, Harry. A juice artist. About all he does these days is reduce hernias and sign death certificates at that steel mill he works at. Well, at least he tried. Now where did you, how far do you say it is from here to the rim again? - The Cauldron? - Yeah. Mile, mile and a quarter. Stay west of this ridge. What about black flies? - They're in. - Hey, D.J.? - Yeah? - You didn't tell us it was black fly season. For Christ sake, Abel, they are just little black flies. Well, are there many of them? Millions. Well, golly. Alright, men, we're on our way. - Alright. - God help the natives. We wanna know why we can't land on the river itself? What's that? The river, why can't we land on it? Because there's not enough water. Because there's not enough water. There's not enough water. We're 225 air miles from the nearest cathouse. And there ain't a place to land except two piss holes on the rim of the Cauldron. That's one hell of a trek you fellas have got yourself headed on. It's only 15 miles. Yeah, 15 miles of loon shit, bear shit, moose shit and every other kind of shit shit. That river's in the middle of the Cauldron, and the Cauldron's in the middle of nowhere. Hey, you two fellas brothers, hey? Yeah. Holy Mexican Jesus. Two doctors in the same family. I'll bet your folks find you pretty damn handy. We're indispensable. It's a little early for that, isn't ti? - Hey, look, I got something... - Jesus. Just pull it back a bit, Doc. I got something I want you fellas to see. Hey, now, ain't that something else? That's a winner alright. Thank you. Of course. Looks like somebody tried to pull your asshole out through your armpit. Six days from today around noon. See you then. Good fishing. How about the same place in a year? Once a year. It's called the Cauldron of the Moon. See the Indians believed the moon bumped into the Earth here, and made this huge imprint called the Cauldron. What, were the Indians on peyote? Doesn't look as if the moon bumped into the Earth to me. Okay, now hold it. To the Indians, this whole area is good medicine. Well, here we are. Five little medicines on their way to the one big one. - Okay, stand by. - Is this a take? - Yeah, it's a take. - Terrific. - Cheese. - Cheese. - Cheese. - Cheese. I'd like this other way. No, once we get beyond the next row, it's clear sailing. Alright then, Abe, you alright? Yeah. Just tough to get around here. Is this the only way to come, for Christ sake? It's not far now. That's that spot. You might as well hold on, you're afraid he'll trip us. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. - You good? - Yeah. You wanna do that again, I didn't get a shot of it. Christ. Lost the watch. Too late for that, I've got my camera. - Jesus. - To the left. - Jesus. - Now where are you at D.J.? It's shallower. Nothing's shallow. - Did you give up? - It's shallower. - Here. - Fuck. Frig you laughing at? Wait a minute. Hey, thanks a lot. Look out. - Give me your... - Get ahold of yourself. - Give me your, your hand. - We're dangerous. Shit. Is it deep there? Yeah, it's deep, watch your camera, will you? Shit. Hold the camera. Hold my camera. Christ. Where's your tripod? - Okay. - Might have lost - two of my men. - Here, take my camera. Alright, you guys, take the camera. - Grab it by the handle. - What am... You can handle it. And my binoculars. Okay. - Alright. - I can handle this, this is okay. What was the name of that dive in Puerto Rico you took us to last year? It wasn't a dive. Come on, Abel, they were pissing in the streets. Well, that's because they drink a lot. How does that make sense? Who's turn is it next year? Mine. And where are you taking us, Marty? After this there's only one place left, Boston. Where's the bloody campsite? It's all bush here. We clear the bush. We clear the bush? We clear the bush. And then what? Then we eat. Then we sleep. That's it? What did you expect, Martin? Dancing? - Isn't it funny? - The Biops report said sarcoma, the X-ray said sarcoma, what the hell was I supposed to do? What did the kid say? What do you mean, what'd the kid say? The kid was prepped and under by the time I got there. Every legend has its origin. You never seen him before? - No. - Wouldn't it be funny if this place really is a magic place. Why would it be funny? If the moon did bump into the Earth here. - Why no one noticed it... - I'm not saying it did, but if it did, then this place really is magic. Tiers got no middle. It does? It doesn't. It's got a beginning and it's got an end, it's got no middle. Yeah, but in this theory, A simple procedure... the beginning and the end overlap. And that's the middle. I'm not a goddamn intern. Are you calling me incompetent? Hell, no, words like that can ruin a man's reputation. I'm doing 10, sometimes 15 operations a day. I'm just trying to make a living. What the hell is wrong with that? What's wrong with making sure? Why are we yelling? We all make mistakes. - Give us a break, will you? - We work with people who make mistakes. Here. - Jesus. - So why don't we put all our mistakes together, and see if we can't get a rebate on our premiums. What the hell does that mean? Let's just say that people... And what rough beasts. You missed the point. This'll all come around at last. But the surgeon is ultimately... Slouches towards Bethlehem to born. Everyone in that operating theater, if someone speaks up and takes responsibility. No one else need's to be directly involved. Once, Yeats. What's Yeats got to with the moon? The moon is magic, right? I suppose you never made a mistake? And Yeats, wasn't he into magic? Answer the question. Well, then let me just say some mistakes. Yeats was into the moon. It must be nice to know you got God on your side. Yeah, well sometimes you're better off with the good Lord. Goddammit, you're self-righteous bastard sometimes. You find nothing wrong with his procedure? Tell us about some of the basket cases you keep going, Harry. Come of it. No, really, I'm fascinated. When they wake up blind or paralyzed, does Harry sometimes wonder if maybe he shaved off just a little more brain than he should have? - You, you... - Wait a minute, I've seen some the wonders you keep going. 90%, flubbing 10%. What the hell does a man have to turn into before you call it quits? You think I should pull a few plugs? Hell no, you wanna see how long you can keep them going, that's your business. - See, my theory does work. - No it doesn't. The world lost a great clown when you gave up neurology. Why is it all pediatricians suffer from premature senility. I think it's the kids. Harry. Mother of pearl. Don't go home. Mother fucker. Help me. Stop you devil. I'm dying. - Don't do that. - Shit. Don't, Don't laugh. Put me back together again. All together now. Put them back together again. Come on, Harry. Use the ole foxtrot. Put them back together again. Put them back together again. Put them back together again. Put them back together again. Put them back together again. Put them back together again. Put them back together again. Put them back together again. Put them back together again. Put them back together again. Watch your hooks. Mitzi, get out of there. Alright, I'll get out of the way. For Christ sake, Abel, you'll scare the fish. What fish? Well, if you use your wrist, you might catch one. With the wrist, always with the wrist. With the wrist. I said use your wrist. Where are the boots, you guys? I'm using my wrist already. They're by the fire, I think. You're using your elbow. I can live with it, D.J., I can live with it. You're not, you know? (Pans clattering What's he yelling about? His boots, he can't find his boots. They're by the fire. I told him that. They're not here. Check the tent. I've checked the tent. No one's boots aren't here. Where are you going? To help him look for the boots. Take the bottle away from him while you're at it. - Shut up. - Hey, everybody's boots are gone. Sure they're gone. I'm telling you, D.J., I'm not kidding you. They're not here. Well, where did we leave 'em? - Where did we leave 'em? - I don't know. They're not here now. Well, they must be here somewhere. No, I've looked everywhere, they're not here. Why I looked in the tents, I checked the woods. They're not here. Is anything else gone? I don't think so. It's just the boots. Have you found them yet? - No. - Somebody has stolen the goddamn boots. Why would anyone steal five pairs of boots? Because they're worth 40 bucks a pair. There's a lot of other stuff around here that's worth much more. Maybe whoever stole them is a boot freak. I don't know. Don't you think we should discuss this a little? Discuss what? The alternatives. What alternatives? You figure maybe the bastard who stole "em is going to bring them back? Start a bonfire. This area must be air patrolled. A plane can't land on the river. Look, we've got maybe 12 hours of daylight left. If I leave now, I can make that dam by tonight. A helicopter can get in here. They charge you for silly rescues, Mitzi. And if you start a forest fire, they throw away the key. We're sitting in the middle of a tinderbox, and you wanna burn it down for a lousy five pair of boots? Jesus Christ. You know all the goddamn answers. Well, this dam's 27 miles upriver and the lake's only 15. What do you want me to do there, Abel? Grow roots for six days? Look, just let me take care of it, okay? D.J, I just don't know what the rush is. I just told you. And besides, six days of you clowns hobbling around and bitching, who needs that? How do you know they'll be anybody at that dam? They don't put beaver dams on government maps, Harry. It's a hydro-dam and operations that big don't run themselves. They'll be someone there. Well, I sure hope they have boots. And I don't like the idea of you going up the river alone. I wouldn't have to go up the river alone if you clowns had brought extra shoes. We wouldn't be in this jackpot. Get off it, D.J. Look, two months ago I sent everyone Xerox sheets of what I would supply and what you would bring. You were to bring extra shoes and your toothbrushes. I supplied everything else. I had everything organized. All you had to do was follow orders. What Xerox sheet? You know, Abel, there are people who for as little as $50.00, will break both a man's legs. Gee, that's terrible. - What? - Gotta pee. - Go, Abel. - Yeah. - Yeah, do it outside? - Shit. Jesus Christ. I'm sorry honey. There, you go back to sleep. Little horny devil. Shit. Shit. What is it? - Marty? - What is... - Boy. - Jesus Christ. Harry? - Is he alright? - Yes. - No. - No, what? I need a drink. Harry, the snake How many people know that symbol? Who stole the boots, and why were they stolen in the first place? Go ahead, Mitzi, say it. Say it, you think D.J. put that there, don't you? I don't know who put that there. Come on, take it easy. Look, Harry, somebody's playing a very sick game with us, and ll wanna know who and I wanna know why before it's gets any - My brother - goddamn sicker. - Would never do anything - like that. - He's stuffing - amphetamines. - He's only playing - with them. - What else does he play with? My brother's done a lot of things, but he wouldn't do this. I'll take you word for it. What are you doing, Marty? I'm going upriver after him. - It's too dark. - I don't give a shit. D.J.'s at at the dam by now. - How do you know? - That's 27 He's out there alone, you - miles, alright? - Know? - We know that. He did not do that. No one said he did, now shut your goddamn mouth. Where are my boots, goddammit. Where are my boots? They were stolen this morning. Hey, Mitzi, this animal has only been dead for a couple of hours. The blood is almost fresh. We'll find D.J. in the morning, Marty. - When it's light. - As soon as it's light. Do we have anything we can use as a weapon, Harry? Just the hatchet. God. It'd be almost childish if it weren't so horrible. D.J.? D.J.? D.J.? Christ, slow down, my feet are Killing me. Let's try it up there. D.J.? You know how far we've come in the last three hours? A mile. Just over a mile. I've been counting. Counting what? Our steps. We should get back to the river. We might have crossed him. We won't pass him for days. Now move a little closer. Why do you want this now, Abel? For Sheila and the kids. God. How old are they now, anyway? One's 11, one's 12, and ll don't know how old the other one is. Do you know it's name? Sure. Now try and look like you're enjoying yourselves. I feel like one of the goddamn monkees. See no evil. Hear no evil. Speak no evil. Well, I like it. Today, Abel, today. - No! - Jesus Christ. Get out of here. Come on. Let's go, let's get outta here. God. Come on, come on, Abel. Shit. You guys! D.J.? Hey, Mitzi? Martin, come here. Come here! What? God. Hold his head, I'm gonna roll him over. Easy, easy. - What is it? - Jesus. Hey, wait a minute. Easy. My God. God. He's dead, Martin. Marty, he's dead. Marty? Who was up there? - What? - Who was it, Marty? Was, was someone up there? I heard him yell, D.J., Harry. Marty? Look, was somebody up there? Yes, but it wasn't D.J. Then why'd you yell his name? It wasn't D.J. Harry, I swear it wasn't D.J. You don't seem too sure about that. I'm sure, goddammit, what do you want me to say? I'm sure. Abel is dead, Harry. We're just, just, just trying to find out what happened. He broke his goddamn neck, that's what happened. Or someone broke it for him. Was it a man? I don't know, it was just, it was just a movement. Those bees were no accident, Harry. They were no accident. We should have waited. What about my brother? If we'd have waited, Abel would be still be alive. Waited for what? Waited for help. We're in the middle of nowhere, Mitzi. No one's gonna help us. Maybe we should go back. To what? To the goddamn camp site. - Well, what about... - We can still go back to the, to the lake. Well, what about D.J.? D.J. can take care of himself. We'd never make it - back to the lake. - You son of a - We don't have a compass. - Bitch. In that bush, we'd be walking in circles in half an hour. Then let's stay here. Goddammit, Harry, we'll start a goddamn fire. Something we should have done yesterday. There's three of us, we can fight him. Jesus Christ, Mitzi, fight who? We don't know if it's one man or 10. What the hell do we do? We keep going till we reach the dam. Get the hell outta here as fast as we can. You were such a boob. Such a gentle boob. Well, couldn't we say something? Say what? He's dead. Wait a minute, hold on. How far do you think we've come? We're maybe halfway there. Halfway, terrific. Come on. He's not gonna make it any further. Better find a place to make camp before it gets dark. Yeah. Take it easy on the sauce, Marty. Shit. Talk to him, Harry. Give me the hatchet. I'll check up ahead. Yeah, be careful. Jesus. Bet this must be like coming off a double shift at the steel mills. What do you do there, anyway? It works. Thinking of getting into that end of the business? I'm interested. Are you guys alright? I sit in a small office with enlarged scales and 80 cartons of industrial safety posters. It's was D.J.'s afterwards. Tried getting my head in shape. Why is that? Harry, it wouldn't matter one spec of bite dung if I never picked up a scalpel again. I'm 38 years old, and I'm an independent alcoholic who's last serious boyfriend is now a borderline psychotic teaching karmic fascism in the mountains. Didn't you once say that self-sacrifice was alright as long as you could pay the rent? Was I drinking at the time? You were never a drinker, were you? Yeah, four years nonstop in Korea. I can even remember when I gave it up and why. Why? Because of a bridge over the Imjin River. I was drunk and bored at the time. God, was I bored. And I flew under it with an English Captain. There was only six inches of clearance between the wingtips and the piers. Pretty stupid? We'll find him, Martin. Don't worry. - Like Abel? - Hey, you guys? Look what I found. It's D.J."s rope. I found it. - What? - I almost missed it. There was nothing up here, just the rope. - What? - Just the rope. That's all? D.J.? Why would he tie a rope across here, Harry? Maybe he wanted to use it to pull himself back? Hey, hey, watch it, watch it. Those rapids look like murder. Hey, Martin. Marty, you can't get across there now. Jesus, you're to weak. He could be just across there hurt. For God's sake, let's get over there. For Christ sake, you goddamn drunk. - Harry. - Get your... - Harry? - Let him go. - Get your hands off. - Alright, asshole, kill yourself. When we go across Martin, we do it together. - Yeah. - In the morning. I knew he was just over there somewhere. We'll make a fire, Martin. Don't worry, D.J. will see a fire. I don't think we can risk a fire. It will be dark soon. What the hell are we gonna eat if we don't have a fire? You have to boil this freeze-dried shit. You wanna risk a fire? Alright, what have we got for din-dins? Other than this little delicacy. Harry, doesn't want a fire, so we'll see what we can eat. That's no good. That's not good. No good. Rice, no good. Powdered milk. Terrific. Terrific. And in here, what have we got in Marty's pack? Mine's no good to you, scotch. Toilet paper. I see you came prepared. Anyone for dates and powdered milk? Well, I guess there are worst things in life than powdered milk, I suppose. Over here, D.J. Where's the flashlight? - Not the flashlight. - Not so loud. I'm serious. See anything? No. Where are you, D.J.? Alright, Harry? Yeah, I'm alright. Harry? Marty? God, my leg, my leg! My leg, my leg! My leg! God, it fucking hurts. God, take it off. My leg! Take it easy. Hold on. Jesus Christ. - Pull him up. - Take it off my ankle. Pull up. Help me. God. Get it off, get it off my leg. - Come on, get down here. - God, he got me. That wasn't an accident. Somebody set the traps. What is going on here? God. What has happened? My... My God. I'm gonna die. I was thinking... I left my pack in the river. Get a sleeping bag around him. How bad is it? There can't be any fibula left. What's happened to the artery? Harry, make sure the artery's alright. Yes, it's alright. Give me a drink. Let's give him a shot. I need a drink. Harry, D.J. did this. The river was full of animal traps. D.J. didn't do it. It's like a minefield out there. Who then? Why? Why is he hovering around us? Why? God damn you. A lot of very careful hatred has gone into this thing. All I'm saying is that if anyone of us, if anyone of us knows something, then he should tell the others. Now's the time. Goodie, goodie, goodie, goodie. Nothing like jolly self-incrimination. We're doctor's, Marty. It's not inconceivable that one of our mistakes is the reason for all of this. Shall we start with our own mistakes? All the mistakes we helped with, all the mistakes we participated? How about just our worst mistakes? Our very worst, best mistakes. After all, if you want to proceed in turning it into a witch hunt. It was just a simple question. All you have to say is no, I'll take your word for it. But he can't stop. It's possible we're all paying for something one of us is responsible for. It's not outside the realm of possibility. Yeah, but it's one hell of an assumption. Then tell me, Harry, what in god's name this clown is after? The biggest stag? You're getting drunk, Mitzi. Spare me the temperance lecture, Harry. Martin's the one who's supposed to be getting drunk. Just because your old man was a juicer, Harry, it doesn't make the rest of us candidates for skid row. I know what I'm doing. Hey, after you could find out which one of us it was. We could throw the rascal to the wolves for the sake of the team. You better, old buddy. How are we gonna move him, Harry? Build a stretcher. Stretcher. It's gonna be murder carrying him in this shit. Why don't we float him? Now, do it now. Better drink the rest of that. I'm drunk enough. Are you sure? Christ. What difference is it gonna make? That'll work. Okay, easy. Jesus Christ. You goddamn asshole. You wanna do the honors? Which way do you want your instep? Facing front. Be gentle. I'm gonna show him down. Paddy whack It's too goddamn deep. Give the dog his bone It was your idea. This old man goes floating home For Christ sake. Stop pushing. What? Anyway, he told me once, how to train a chimpanzee to salute. So what you do is you chain the chimpanzee at the end of a large tent or a large hall, it doesn't matter. And at the other end you chain a dog or a cat or an armadillo. Now this is really interesting. Where was I? Yeah. So then you let the people in. Let all the people who wanna advance their education - Alright? Of the chimpanzee. But they know the chimp and they concentrate on the dog. Now they circle around the dog and shout salute. And the dog just stands there like he didn't hear. And so they break his hairy little leg. Men, halt, halt. Knick knack, patty whack, break a doggie's bone Knick knack patty whack Break a doggie's bone This old man goes floating home. Anyway, I'm jumping out to day two. Too much rocking. - Which is then... - No! Around that rock. No, no, no, this way. - Salute. - It's this way. The chimp... Go straight through here. You gotta know where stepping. Is watching all of this very carefully. Dog, he's just lying there, he's just lying there howling. Wait a minute, I can't hear him. Wait, I gotta get my legs here. You're like the worst date, will you make up your mind? This old man he played five He played knick knack on his Knick nack patty whack Give the dog his bone This old man goes floating home Comes the day of judgment. The people come in, stand in a circle around the howling armadillo, jaw, shout, salute. This time, still breaking another leg, they bring out their clubs and they beat the little bugger to death. Before you can praise the Lord, the whole Mexican Jesus, they're up at the other end of the tent gathering around the chimp. The chimp jumps up in the air and what does he say? Salute. Salute. It works. The enterprise is a little patience. Jesus Christ. Wait here, I'll check it out. Give me a cig? It's my last one. Thanks. Fuck. Fuck. We're sitting ducks down here. Your goddamn brother and his bright ideas. Do you really believe there's a madman out there who wants revenge? I don't know. Do you? I don't know. There's a certain kind of - What? - Unholy precision to this whole thing. Nothing's been left to chance. Our boots were stolen - What are you talking about? - To draw us out. To draw out D.J. My leg was broken to slow us down. How do you know that? The rapids. Well, perhaps. It all seemed to come together at the same time. That rope was put there - to draw us across. - Hey, Mitzi? - The stag's head, the snake. - Shut up. Location, precision. - And the ceremony. - Harry? - Harry, wait up. - The ceremony. We're being drawn deeper and deeper, - I said wait up. Into a kind of demonic - ritual. - Harry? We're being used, and this thing, which is seminiferous force Over this way. We can get through. Knows that if it performs certain accidents, - How do we in certain order, - get through? Certain other things - are bound to happen. - I'm not going up - there, Harry. - He knows he really has us. What are you, we have to go up there. We'll lose him if we go up. An be appeased the path... What's going on? What's going on here? I was just invoking a bit of the old demon for ole' Mitz, here. - Shut up. - Hey, Mitzi, what the hell's going on? You bastard. I've been beaten up in toilet fight, - better men than you. - I said, shut up. Jesus Christ. You son of a bitch. I've busted my ass all day for that little faggot, and he turns around and plays head games with me. Well, here's a head game for you, carry your own carcass out of here. How quickly we forget our manners, hey, Mitzi? Shut up, the both of you. Don't tell me to shut up, Harry, you owe me. I owe you nothing. I carried your old man when you were busy kissing ass, don't forget it. I'm warning you. - You don't know. - You're a right son of a bitch, you were fast for director, old man dying of cancer. Hey, hey, you guys. Hey, you guys, stop. I'm busting a leak here. Hey, you guys, stop. Help me here. Quit tumbling around, you're insane. You guys? Come on, help me, you guys. Harry, Harry, we're gonna lose him. Harry, help me! Help me! My God Help me, come on! My God, I'm going over. Help me! Is he conscious? He's still responding to external stimulus. Partial dilation of the left cuticle, but he's responding. I don't understand his fever. It looks like endotoxic shock. - Christ, Mitzi... - I didn't say it was, I said it looked like it. I think it's a subdural hematoma. Let's hope it's that. Marty, Martin? What? Don't leave me. I'm sorry I said what I said about your old man. Who cares? I'm trying to apologize, Harry, can't you accept that? I'll take it into consideration. Don't be too proud, Harry. We still need each other. Poor old, Andy. You should have seen the shit hole he was living in. I saw it. It took them a week to find the body. Sitting on the toilet in his room. So they wouldn't leave a mess for anyone to clean up. He wasn't that different from my old man. You never met my old man, did you, Harry? Just a couple of silly old dreamers who couldn't handle the sauce. Hey, remember the time, remember the time were he got... I don't remember. You never saw him again much after that, did you? I never saw him again. Hey, Mitzi? Mitzi, come here. What is it? Is it the dam? Jesus Christ. It looks like a fire. A long time ago. Look, do we have to carry him all the way down this river? We'll take the ridge. Yeah, yeah, we'll be out in the open. Hey, what the hell? He's back, Harry. It's a gun. - A what? - A gun. For service medal. He was in the Pacific. In the Army in World War ll. Leave us alone, you bastard. Maybe we're going in the wrong direction. Jesus Christ, maybe we're going in the wrong direction. No. Where the hell is this dam? It can't be far now. I can't even remember how long we've been carrying him up this goddamn river. Hey, Marty? How long have we been carrying you up this river? You've been keeping track, Marty? He doesn't answer, I think he's taking a nap, Harry. Yeah. Gotta sign off now, Marty. What? Now hold, steady. Jeez. God, goddamn. God. Why don't you, why don't you watch where you're going? I can't see a goddamn thing back there. Now how about letting me take the front for awhile. His ass weighs a ton. So does his front. Not as much as his ass. What difference does it make? It makes a hell of a difference. You try it back there for awhile. Alright, alright, you take the front. If you think it's so much easier, take it. Now you're being petty. Mitzi, if you wanna take the front, take the front, it doesn't matter to me. Well, it matters to me. It's a hell of a lot easier when you can see where you're going. Then take the goddamn thing. I will. Now these poor bastards used to scrounge gasoline from my regiment. We could never figure out what they wanted it for. This is right after the landing at Incheon. Each one of these Korean regulars were issued two week rations of rice. But nothing to cook it with, see? Nothing to cook it in. Well, one afternoon, I saw these, three of 'em in a rice paddy with a barrel of our gas. Now they reshaped the sides of the paddy into a small pond. Most of these rice paddies were composed of human and animal waste. So, they soaked the sides of the paddy with gasoline and lit it. And then they poured the rice into the paddy water. And when it boiled, they ate. They ate it. They had it with minor ingenuity, the poor bastards. You told me this before, Harry. What's the point? Well, the point is either self-evident or there isn't any. Jesus Christ. He's not gonna make it, you know? He'll make it. If he lasts the night, are we still going carry him? What? Don't tell me it hasn't crossed your mind, Harry. That thing out there will come for us. And when it does, we won't be able to do a damn thing to stop it. We'll be too weak. That thing out there is a man, Mitzi. A man. He could have killed him this afternoon when he pinned that goddamn medal on him, Harry. He's not after him, he's after us. He's using him to grind us down. As long as we're carrying him, he has us just where he wants us. We've got to start thinking like him. He expects us to carry him. He's counting on it. I don't think so. If anything, he wants to see if we'll leave him. He wants to degrade us first. Hasn't he already? Jesus, he hasn't even started. He wants our faces in it. He wants us crawling. When we're dead, who's gonna know whether we crawled or not? We will. We'll be the only ones. Look Harry, he'll come after us. He can get him anytime he wants. Our only chance is to make a break for it. The sooner we get to the damn, the sooner they'll come back for him. It makes sense. We're the ones he has to worry about now. We can't just leave him here. Now what bloody difference does it make? - Look at him. - Hey, leave him alone. For Christ sake, Harry, he's had it. Even if he survives, what are we going to have? Another vegetable? Why don't we just wait and see? Why are you doing this, Harry? You're not that softhearted. You left your old man, why not him? It's our lives. You wanna risk our lives for that? Bring it up again and I'll smash your goddamn head in. He was a drunk and an asshole and I wrote him off. I made a mistake. I don't need you to remind me. I don't hold it against you, Harry. Yeah, of course you don't. We survived a lot together, Harry. We can survive this is we use our heads. If we leave him. Who's going to know, Harry? I am. You romantic schmuck. Son of a bitch could kill me, but I'll be goddamn if I let him degrade me. 'I be damned if I let him do that. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. It's just a matter of time. Just a matter of time. Hey, this is ready. What? Look, Abel. What the? Jesus. God, what is this? What kind of maggot mind does that? He could have cut our throats last night. I was tired. You were drunk. Don't talk to me like that, Harry. That thing's never gonna let us out of here. - What butcher did this? - What? It's an Army X-ray. We're paying for something that somebody else did. This was made in 1945. Now we have some idea of what we're dealing with. Let's go. I'm not carrying him, Harry. I'm not carrying him. I'm not carrying him. I'm not carrying him. Jesus Christ, he's a vegetable. You'll get us killed. That maniac doesn't want him, he wants us. You'll get us killed, leave him. Leave him. Stupid bastard. You'll get us killed. I wanna live, Harry. I wanna live. He'll get you killed, Harry. Hey, Harry? You forgot something'. Goddamn, hero. Goddamn stupid hero, bastard. God. Goddammit. Goddamn. You son of a bitch. Get out my goddamn way. I don't, I don't wanna be... Better get a move on it. Better get, better get a. Get on the stretcher. Get on there. Right there. Okay, God, okay. Jesus, fucking, Jesus. God. Fuck it. You'll get us both Killed. Where do we go now, Harry? What do we do now? Shit. Hey, hold it. What? Let's get to him, Harry. My God is it... Jesus. D.J.? What is it? It's traction. He's put him in traction. A medical discharge. Matthew Crowley. Come on, he's dead. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on. He's going to do to us what those Army quacks did to him. He's going to butcher us. Come on, help me get him down. Let's just get the hell out of here, Harry. Come on. Jesus. He's alive? Is he alive? What are you doing, Harry? Come on, let's get out of here, for Christ sake. We can't leave him like this. What are you going to do, Harry? Kill him. You're crazy. You hear me, you're crazy. Mitzi? Mitzi? Mitzi? Hey, Mitzi? Goddamn it, Mitzi, where are you? Hey, Mitzi? Hey, Mitzi? Mitzi? Gone, Marty. I can't carry you any further. I'll come back for you. I swear. Please. Please, understand. Hey? God. Good. God. Where are you? You in here? You're a Nazi. No more Killing, no more. No more. You're not going to kill us. No more. Come on! - I'm not Matthew. - Come on, you bastard. It was Matthew. You're blind. Who's that? Who is that? Christ. You one of them doctors? - Yeah. - I tried to stop him. I tried. The others, where are the others? They're dead. I'm sorry. No, it weren't you. It weren't you. What's your name? Jessie. I'm gonna get you on the bed. Here you go. Jeez. I'm sorry. Easy now. Go. It's not safe for you here. My brother ain't the same as us no more. But he hunts good. And he provides. Go. Go, son. Go now. I don't know where to go. Now. What the hell? God, come on! Come on! God. God, help. God. Shit. God. Help me. Help me. Mitzi? Mitzi? Harry? God, is that you? Is that you? Where are you? Help me, Harry. I'm hanging from a tree or something. I'm tied up, Harry. Matthew, I got a gun. You've got a gun? - Hey, where is he? - Behind me. Somewhere behind me. Help me, for Christ sake. Where the hell did you go? I came back for you. - You bastard. - I wouldn't have left you there. I swear. Now come on, help me. You got a gun, he's, he's not armed. What is it, what is it? - What the hell is it? - Goddamn it. Answer me. My artery is severed, Mitzi. The popliteal. Jesus Christ. Help me. You gotta a gun, - Shit. You gotta a gun. Come out and get him. Kill him now. Harry? I'll count it off for you. The kind of reach you got. Mitzi? Don't show panic now. - Let me help you. - Does he speak? - Please. - Does he understand language? I don't know. Here I come. No panicking. Harry, don't think. Don't think. He's behind me, building a fire. Harry, he's going to burn me. Shoot him, use the gun. Use the gun. I can't see him. Help me, for Christ sake, help me. Harry, he's talking. He's trying to say something. What? Repeat it. I can't make it out. Essa. Jess, something. Jessie, it's his brother. - You got him? - He's in here. Bring him out, for Christ sake. What's the matter with you? He wants his brother, Harry. Trade him, Harry, trade the fucker. Shut up. Or I'll leave you there. Okay, alright. Whatever you say. I'm sorry. Just hurry, for Christ sake, Harry. I swear I wouldn't have left you, Harry. I was coming back and I... Harry? Harry? He's bringing more wood - Matthew? - For the fire. No, Jessie says, no. Help, fire! My, God, you won't try. Get out here, you bastard, get out here. Harry? - He's, he's burning me. - Shut up. - Get out here, you bastard. - Let me handle it. Get out here. Help me!
