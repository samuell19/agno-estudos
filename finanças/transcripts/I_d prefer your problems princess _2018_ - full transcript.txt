Some other time? It will be difficult for you even to count your legs if you don't tell me where she is listen to me. Now you listen to me. How am I supposed to know where your Tanya is? She's sleeping on the ground. I don't know where we are I don't care. It's your Tanya you take care of this. I was just passing by and decided to help. But now I'm gonna put down the phone and go on my way. Here's what you're gonna do. Look after her until she gets herself together. She's a mess at the moment. Do you know whose daughter she is? Let me guess yours? Yes mine, good boy. Do you know who I am? I suppose her father. I don't know what you're doing there with my daughter but I like you. Don't make your judgments too quickly Pops. Okay now whether you know it or not my daughter has run away from home. You slept with her? Who do you think I am? God sees everyone. Even if I wanted to looks like she's got other plans. In two weeks she's getting married. Take good care of her and bring her home to me. Soon she'll realize that without my money she's nobody. I already heard this somewhere. You really got the lot of money? Curiosity killed the cat you know. Don't worry I'm not a cat. You bring her to me safely understand. 10,000 and I take her to you safely. 10,000 what? Do you realize who you're talking to? The wedding is in two weeks. I remember as if it was my own wedding. We've got a deal on the 10 grand? It's just 10. Okay deal and my daughter return safe, healthy, and conscious. Not a penny more. And she'll be totally conscious I promise. See I didn't ask for a penny more only 10 Come on princess let's go collect 10 grand. God your gift is so heavy. Good morning princess some tea? Who are you? Your gaurdian angel, not as cute as Cupid but you don't look like Angelina Jolie either. Hey where is my jewelry? Oh I'll look tomorrow. I hate alcohol. Me too. Listen let's get down to business. I've made a deal with your father. I take you back to him and he pays me good money. So don't move I've got no time for this now. How much? How much what? Is he paying you? 10,000. Jerk. He won't spare even 100 for my wedding. So you're a runaway bride? What happened you didn't like your fiance? None of your business. In my house it's my business and you know we're much closer than you think. So come on answer the question. Don't lie I didn't sleep with you. Actually I didn't even try. It's enough that you puked on me. And that will cost you 1000 for my shirt. Why did you run away? That's none of your business. Maybe it's the dress. It didn't look quite right on you. Something like that. I want to get married in Madagascar and he doesn't. Who Brad Pitt? Dad. What? I'd love to have your problems princess. I don't care what you think. Can you believe it? Oh God Madagascar. Shut up. Madagascar honest. Tanya where are you? You escaped. I'm talking to you. Go to hell. Tell me your location right now. I'm talking to you. Go to hell I said! You threw the phone. How will I call your father? Do what I say. Your father isn't the only man who's not playing jokes here. If I open the door you might be smeared on the wall like ground beef.

I can't. I bought a new dress. Why not yesterday my pearl, why not yesterday? I thought it would be too soon. Why, why did you think? Who asked you to think, who asked you? You know what if you became like this I'll think about it even more longer next time. Next time may not happen. Think about it. What do you mean may not happen? How can this happen? Pray for me.

Just imagine someone is chasing you. Who? I'll explain to you later come on. Where are we going? You may think I'm joking but I've being spied on. I owe them a lot of money. You're out of luck you've been seen with me. You can run to Daddy but I'm sure you won't make it past these guys. I don't care where they will find your corpse if I don't return back the money but as for me I want to live. And as for you you're coming back with me to daddy. You agree? Fishing? You have money? Later, come on let's go. What about fisher rod? What? Oh she wants a fishing rod. Come on! I won't go, my dress. What's wrong with your dress? It's dirty. Oh where did you grow up in a castle? I won't go. Stay here. Come on. Take this. Come on. What a nasty thing. I won't wear it it's secondhand. Don't wear it. My ex-wife loved it. Who cares what you want to wear? What? Let's drive into the sunset. You can go to daddy if you want. What about a helmet? First you wanted a fishing rod, and then a dress, and now a helmet. Princess you're so spoiled. Have you ever seen a lake in your life? Soon you will see one. And where's my seatbelt? I can't believe this. Where is the damn lake? Was it the purpose? And what was the purpose? The broken bike on the dusty road? You're completely spoiled. The world doesn't owe you anything. Just calm down. Enjoy our hike it's marvelous. I'm tired. I'm hungry. That's a good sign. It means you're still alive. And I still have a shot for my 10 grand. Listen I'd like to be away from you too but I'm here now. What should I do cry? Just keep your mouth shut and let's walk. Watch the way to speak please. Okay you're not gonna talk like this to me you understand? I'll talk to you the way I want. You can talk with your father like this not with me. I'm not a bag of money for your wishes. Yes you just wanted to extort money from my dad. That's none of your business. Really? You're nothing but a spoiled kid who thinks that she's a sexy diva. If you think that I'm gonna turn back to you then you're mistaken. Whatever. So why did you stop? Move your bum princess. I'm not taking a single step. Who do you think you're hurting? I don't care about you. Even if I die here I don't care. Oh you mean you don't need 10 grand? And you think I've never seen 10 grand before? With a bike like that no. To hell with the bike. Listen I'm not gonna sleep in the field. And I'm not ready to follow someone I don't know I don't know where. So what's the problem then? Go home to daddy. This girl has to come back. Hey come on get up. Let's go. What a lousy bore. Hey wait. I'm joking wait for me. I see you've come down to our level of simple folk. Your fiance was right you're a mess. Look it's motel. Where? Wait wait wait wait wait. I'll do the talking. You stay here. Lux with a king size bed. No economy no bedroom in the corner. Lux. Economy. You're an economy, he's alright. No not lux, no not lux. You're just jealous. You two are twins? You're very observational. Welcome would you like to rent room? You two are king beauties. A room for two please. For two? For two yes. Would you like a lux? Bath, television, king sized bed. Is there anything else available? Unfortunately there is nothing else available. I apologize I've made a mistake. We are out of lux too. There are no free rooms. Nothing at all? Unfortunately all the rooms have been booked. Beauties we're dead tired. Are you really gonna leave us out on the street? Help a helpless brother and sister. Maybe a tiny hole in the wall for the night. We've been walking for three hours, three hours. I just can't tell which one of you is much prettier. I'm gonna have heart attack looking at both of you. Unfortunately we have no free rooms. But if you don't mind we can put you up in the storage room. Okay the storage room. $10. Please let me show you to the storage room. Good night. They're really twins. So what? You're not a guy you won't understand this. Whatever. Almost a lux. No way I'm not sleeping here. Take it easy princess. We could have been sleeping in the field. There could be mice, bugs. And it could have been so cold and wet in the morning. Very funny. I hope that you remember the number of your father. Good evening my lovely lady. How are you? Listen my lovely treasure. You've got your life and I've got mine. Remember it was you who left me. What do you want from me now? No don't panic. I'm telling you not to panic. Everything will be clear in the morning go to bed. Just imagine how sexy and beautiful you are and how lucky you are okay? Alright baby good night. Groupie? Ex-wife. Surprise. It's natural a man gotta have a wife. Sometimes she becomes his former. And what's so surprising in this? Then why did you leave her? She left me. And you still talk to her? And that surprises you too? A man who calms down and talks to his ex that's left him. What surprised me? When you've grown up a bit you'll understand. And for your information my ex-wife is a sexy pussycat not the mangy mutt like you. Oh I imagine sexy pussycat. Yes sexy pussycat. And for what does she need you? Well I have my success with beautiful women. Yeah keep laughing. You can at least say thanks for making bet for us to sleep in. I'm not sleeping here. Then don't sleep. You can stay awake for weeks. You're not such a beauty that it could affect your looks anyway. Asshole. Cheap trick, I'm sleeping. I must warn you the world will continue annoying you. I snore, good night. Tomorrow will be even harder. Maybe it's better to go to your dad. It's heavy for me. What do you know about heaviness? You know so carry the tent yourself. Sorry my pearl but that's not part of our deal. I took it and you're gonna carry it. You stole it. Let's say I borrowed it. You stole it. More scorn. I left my motorbike on the left side of the road and this is what the world gives back. Yeah left in one place and stole from another one. God will understand me anyway. Is this how all thieves think? Did anyone put a little bit of effort into raising you? You're so offending honey. That's the truth sweetie. Listen you want to take you to jail? Come on. I'm not going anywhere. You can turn me in they'll lock me up like a monkey. It has its discomfort but don't care. Come on let's go. Say yes to a woman and she'll do the opposite. By the way what's your name? Tanya. Excellent my name is Ely if that interests you. Nope. If you need some help just cry out Ely. Come on princess take a dip. The water is magical. I don't want. So make yourself want to. I didn't want to tell you but there's no other way. You smell like a dog. So be a good girl and get in. Go to hell. For 10 grand you'll deal with it. I'm afraid your father will bring down the price for such dirty daughter. Princesses don't reek. Shut up. If I reek then you're a prime example for a dump. Mr. Macho ha ha. You look like a beggar. You're dirty dumb stupid loser and you stink. Did you hear me? Hey. Where are you? Ely I can't swim. Ely I'm frightened. Ely what's going on? This isn't funny. Ely come please. Help. Help. I can't believe you fell for such an old trick. You can't swim? So tell me now. Who would you rather depend on your wealthy father of this dirty loser that will lose your hand? I'm not sleeping here. Don't I took this tent for me. Besides princesses are to sleep in castles. So go find yourself a castle and sleep in it. I see you don't want to get 10 grand. Calm down. To be honest without your rich daddy you're nothing. You can't even fight off a mosquito on your own. You want to know why you're running away with me like a pet without an owner? It's because you're bored. You're bored from your rich perfect life and you want to go on an adventure. And that's what you're getting with me. Or maybe it's me. Maybe you like me. I'm not so ugly am I? Idiot. Maybe I'm a genius. An idiot. Don't worry I'm not gonna lay a finger on you. Beautiful women are my taste not frogs. I can give you a kiss as an exception that will turn you from a frog into a princess. You are an idiot and your jokes are stupid. Oh go cry about it. Go go to your daddy. I will I'm going to the city. Go. I will. So go. Why are you pushing me away? Okay stay. If you see a bear play dead. I'm just joking there are no bears here. Princess. Where are you? I can smell you. Hey princess is your name James Cook? It's hard to find you without the map. You forgot your pretty shoes. I didn't. Well if you didn't. Those cost $500. You are the one who threw them in the first place. I do what I want with my shoes and it's none of your business don't touch them. I don't even want to think about it. Let's go Amazon lady I'm going fishing and not going after you in the woods. Let's go. We still need to find your purse and hat. Where are you going? Fishing. What about me? What about you? Nothing. I thought so. Just go to bed. If anything happens cry out loud. I said I'm not sleeping inside it. Okay good luck for the mosquitoes they will love you. What's it to you? Absolutely nothing just like I told you. If anything happens cry out loud. If that bear comes here play dead. You said there are no bears here. I lied. I'm not sleeping here. I'm not. How was your rest beauty? Fine. To the table lady. I don't want. Fabulous the less you eat the more food for me. Little bit of salt would hit the spot. Since that cost 10,000 could you season it a bit better? Sorry that wasn't part of the deal. You can call your father. Maybe he'll borrow a helicopter and send you a five star meal. Look at me I want... To go home? To go to the city. Okay how many times have I told you? You just keep sticking around. Make a decision at least. The fish turned out to be so delicious. It's your loss. Although a little bit of lemon would do the trick. Thyme. What? Fish goes well with thyme and rosemary. What a surprise. We've got Betty Crocker over here. I'm done with you. Me too princess. Listen I'll go fishing again. I'll be back in the evening. Try not to die from your perfection while I'm not here. Gee that's a bit difficult. Hey. That's my money. You won't be needing it now. So you will? Curiosity killed the spoiled princess. If that bear comes say hello for me. No. Oh my God. ♪ Figaro figaro ♪ ♪ Figaro figaro figaro ♪ ♪ La la la la la la la la la la ♪ Ely. Ely. Yes. I'm free. I want something for food okay. I need to find something to eat. I need fresh meat. What makes you happy? Come on princess surprise me. What makes you happy? What in the world can make you genuinely happy? I'm happy when I'm buying a new dress. When I walk down the street and everyone looks at me or these guys look me over. When a girlfriend calls me go shopping or get a manicure. When we are eating chocolate ice cream. That's so fun. When we are dining out in the terrace of a nice restaurants and food is good. When you take a black nighty, eight o'clock. And dance embarrassingly. Did you try it? And when it starts to rain while I'm driving my car I'm happy when I get home and I see the light of my house shining on the front porch. When I'm home. Well you're human princess. Who would have thought? Stop it stop it. Look what you've done. Go get the oar. So you are so great. A little bit yeah. Don't flatter yourself. Don't make me nervous you're helpless creature. I'll throw you in the water and watch you float. Yes my little helpless pussycat? You've got a bad memory. I told you already there's nothing I can do anymore. Okay I'll help you. Okay okay I'll help you. Who's laughing? No no there's no one laughing here. It's just you're getting paranoid baby. I'm here alone yes I'm alone. There's no one here with me. No I can't meet up with you. I can't sorry no no. Why are you laughing? We'll see how you'll talk with your ex when you're my age. How old are you? 33 like Jesus. I won't make it. And how old are you? Oh it's a big secret. Yes. Okay. 22. Everyone says they won't make it to 30 when they're 22 but they make it. I'm surprised myself. At 33 I will have a husband not an ex. That too is something they all say. I haven't seen anyone who made it so far. Maybe you don't know where to look. That's not the point. Having an ex is better than having someone actually. Love doesn't exist it's just you girls like to gossip about it but it doesn't exist. It does you're just a loser. There are more losers in this me. There's a dress that looks familiar over here. That's my dress. If you see that bear... I will send it your way. Pretty girl like you shouldn't be out in this cold. I'm not cold. No you are. We can warm you. Pretty girl like you shouldn't feel cold. I don't think so. I think you do. Yeah she could really use a hand. Pretty girl like you shouldn't deny a helping hand. My husband is in that tent. Why don't you come with us? We have a nice warm fire. And some other stuff to warm you up. My husband is in the tent yeah. He won't know don't worry. It will be quick in and out. Pretty girl like you let's go like you shouldn't be out while her husband is sleeping. Don't touch me animal. You, we'll wake up your husband. Morning darling. Good morning sweetheart. Is this your husband? You're animals. I'll kill you all. Ely. Ely. What? You'd definitely make it in the ghetto princess. Let's go. Where are they? I don't know. Two princesses. I have to. What do you have to? I have to pee. Oh okay. Don't look. Okay. Don't look I saw you. You too don't look. I need too. Don't look. I'm done. Okay. Move. It moved. Who was it? They said to tell you that your girls will suffer if you don't have the money to them tomorrow. My girls? You know what I wish for? I wish I were a 22 year old daughter of a rich father whose only worry is about getting married in Madagascar. Where are we going? I need to go get the 10 grand or they will kill me. Innocent people will be hurt, very innocent. Besides I've stolen a car. But that's alright. Just tell me where do you think we're going? To take you back to your father. Screw you. I'm screwed and so you are. We're both on the same boat don't forget. We're here. What? We're here, out of gas. Where are we? Nowhere. Super. What are you gonna do? I have no idea. So there's probably a gas station nearby. So go look for one. I'm not going alone. You're on your own. Are you just gonna wait here? I'm not gonna do anything. Great. Maybe you go and look for a gas station or house or another car? Loser. Listen I'm exhausted. I need time to think. If you want to go then go. And don't touch me right now. I'm a loser and I want to sleep. Hey you sexy pussycat screw you. If you call back again you will be in wheelchair. He's not your man understand. You'll definitely make it up. Yes. Well then let's go. Where? Forward, you have no other option. Sometimes princesses fall in to the mud too. They cost $500. Strong arms. If I were in your shoes I wouldn't waste 500 like that. You're not in my shoes. After you. So hot today. Wait here. I'm afraid this this is the only schmucking shower in the whole goddam schmucking village. No. Don't worry you're beautiful anyway. Your father won't worry if you are wet or you are not wet. Actually it would be better if you're wet. He'll feel sorry for you. Prepare yourself. No no. No. Don't do it. Some splashes. What are you doing? That water is ice cold you'll be sick. Well what can we do? Things haven't been so good for us lately. How can you treat your girlfriend like that? Why are you torturing her? She likes it she wanted it. Yes. Take this put it on. You're a city girl I knew it from the beginning. You've never seen a village before. You know my dream is to move to the city one day.

We ere living together and it was okay. And then I took a closer look at him and said I do love him. And what about you? Just yours looks a bit strange in that fashion.

For the family. My angry girl don't be so angry. Where did you you find this guy? Actually she was drowning and I saved her. You know how things happen. I looked at her when she was lying there unconscious wet on the sand and I understood that she's the only one. Right baby? Apologies, we've been going through a very hard time. And then I went to her flat and then she understood that I'm the only one. I didn't understand her language and she understand mine. But we didn't need language if you understand what I...

And the second day she tells me she's a bad mother and she takes her away. But it will all pass. But if Olga catches on such kind of behavior I won't be sending my blessings to her wedding. She doesn't look like you. It happens. She doesn't look like her mother either. It happens too. A lot of things happen in this world. You still want to get married in Madagascar? Let's go lucky guy. I'm sorry fellows but I'm a good man. Take care of them. Sorry princess. This is the last kiss of my life. I couldn't pass it up with a beautiful girl like you. Listen to me princess. If you want to be with your daddy do what I tell you okay, let's go. You, hate you selfish. You just stop crying and think of him. Stupid. Stop crying. Your father he's in danger, mine answers. Give me the phone and be useful something. Dad it's me. Hey. You want a final smoke? I mean as long as we're so kind to treat you. Thanks guys. I've never smoked in my life it's too late to start. What a beautiful magical day. When I imagined the last day of my life this is what I saw. Too bad to die on a day like this with beautiful weather. What's the problem? Why didn't you get those 10 grand? You the chump? I had a great plan. Couldn't make it on time. Alright when you're done just give a whistle or something. Thanks guys. That looks like beginning of a great friendship. Papa. That's too much. That's too cruel to bring this child over here. You two have to go, he has paid his dues. What an interesting news. Who did he pay to? For me? Well clown thank you. I'm happy with your work. Are you happy with your present? Thank you. You raised a very good daughter. Thanks God. Tanya do you take Anatolia to be your lawful wedded husband? What did you decide baby? You know what? I'm tired of you treating me like a princess. I need a real man not daddy's little boy. I was beginning to miss you princess. Are you home? I escaped, I escaped. What a poor fellow your father is. Okay come over. Honey pie would you mind if another woman comes and lives with us for a while? You'll like her. Let's go.
