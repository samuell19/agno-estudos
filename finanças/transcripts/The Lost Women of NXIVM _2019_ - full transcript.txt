No. Being gay, period, Was an act of defiance, especially if you're a woman. It was an act of defiance, and I think, for him, Because he treated women as objects, If you're a lesbian then you're not available to him. So could he possibly try to turn her?

Why wait a year, indeed. Why wait a year? Why would you wait a year? Because the story hadn't hit the press.

Could be very sweet, Very funny, Uninhibited, I guess is a nice way of putting it But she lived with keith. Yes. Do you have any reason to suspect Anything suspicious About pam's death? ♪ There was a lot of cancer In that group of people who lived together. ♪ Pamela had kidney cancer. Barbara jeske had brain cancer. Kristen keeffe had cervical cancer. So, there was just a cluster of cancer going on there. That seemed suspicious. Do you know if pamela had a well? I had heard that she did. Do you know who the executor of pam cafritz's will was? Believe it was keith raniere. ♪ Is there any chance that keith might have tried To poison you and pam and barbara, And then found a way to do it. That's a rough question. You asked me that a year ago, I would have said that's outrageous, ridiculous. It's against everything he stands for. But after everything we've seen this year, Anything's possible Narrator: After parlato's interview, The nxivm source reveals that she kept a lock of hair From the time she had cancer. She provides the filmmakers with the hair sample In the hopes that it may help inform parlato's investigation. ♪ This is the hair. This is my hair. I had my hair down to my waist Since I was -- since I met keith. And so when I finally got him to agree To let me cut it, It was a big deal, so I saved the tail. 'cause that hair could be key for us. ♪ Narrator: Frank parlato needs to get the hair sample tested. ♪ What I'm gonna do now is call jason kolowski. He is a forensic scientist Who may be able to at least answer a question or two About whether or not An individual may be able To get another person to contract cancer. [ line rings ] Hello. This is jason. Hey, jason. This is frank parlato calling. Raniere was a fanatic. In many ways, And one of his fanaticisms was that hair represented An essential aspect of a woman's persona. And he did not normally permit them To ever cut their hair. Okay. If they did cut their hair, For whatever reason, He would require them to store that hair To keep it and preserve it. One of the women who survived, The one that had the bladder cancer, Had some of her hair from that period. Now this would go back several years, But would there be anything in the hair That might permit us to make any kind of a test? Absolutely. Yeah. Hair is -- oh, my gosh. It's a phenomenal time capsule for toxic exposure, Environmental exposures. So if she cut a portion of some hair off And saved it during a time Maybe when she was exposed Or even during the time that she had cancer. You definitely could test that hair, And you'll see what you could find. ♪ We sent the hair sample that we got From a inner circle member of keith raniere's To a forensic scientist. He's been running some tests To find out if there was anything in her system When she was living with barbara jeske, Pam cafritz, and keith raniere. As far fetched as it sounds, It is strange to me That four women living with keith raniere Should all come down with cancer. Kolowski: Come on in. Please have a seat. A lot of what I'm working on would be missing persons cases, Advising laboratories on cases That they're working on -- cold cases, things like that. Kolowski: In this case, we have something A little bit different. We received that hair sample from you, And we had an opportunity to go and get it tested. And with that, I was able to divide that section of hair Into three different strands. In an average number of people, This is the normal level of barium and bismuth. That barium and bismuth level Is so significantly higher than the normal In all three of these samples That I'm going to be able to comfortably say That she definitely had some type of a chronic exposure To these two heavy metals, And that look on your face is exactly right. How would someone get bismuth or barium? Barium is occurring in a variety of different sources. Higher concentrations, it's going to be found in things Like gunpowder, explosives, electronic devices, But also found in rat poison, believe it or not. ♪ If it is rat poison, you're talking about a low dose, Chronic exposure to this Over 15 to 24 months. This woman had bladder cancer And the other woman lived with her Had kidney cancer. Interesting. So I would say, for both barium and bismuth, There is actually, within the literature, Lots of references to renal system issues With high-dose exposure. The other thing with that is that We're still thinking about And we're really trying to answer the question From your original conversation with me About the cancer About what caused these women in this house At this time and place in history To all develop different forms of cancer, But we really just don't know. ♪ Is it possible that keith raniere Poisoned these women over a period of years? For those who knew him And the secrecy surrounding him And his inner circle. Makes anything possible. ♪ Come check us out. Let's get this ball in the road.

But, ultimately, keith raniere was the ultimate authority Over this secret group of women Who became his sex slaves. Lalich: Dos was the secret sorority for women Where the branding took place. Rosales: Dos was the elite of the elite, And it gave some of the women special access to keith And vice versa. But the cost of dos is the branding And the humiliation and the pain. [ distorted ] most women were surprised That the brand was the size That it was. Glazer: It can look like a symbol Until you know what to look for. Once you've seen the photograph, "oh, yeah.

Woman: [ distorted ] so many people were upset and leaving. People were coming out, Validating some of the accusations About things that were happening. Basically they lied about it. Then it wasn't just one person lying. It seems like it was a whole group of people Lying to keep a cover in place.

This trial has revealed that raniere, Who portrayed himself as a savant and a genius, Was, in fact, a master manipulator, con man, And the crime boss of a cult-like organization. I would say that there is such a thing as karma. There are other victims. Not all of them have come forward yet. There are still victims who don't dare talk about it, Who are still scared to death, living with it. He totally controlled people. Everybody. The things that they would do for him were believable.
