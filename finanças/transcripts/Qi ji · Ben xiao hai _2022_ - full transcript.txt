SHENZHEN, 2013 It's time to get up. Wake up. Is it too tight? It's all right. MORNING, NOON, NIGHT Easy. Jing Hao? The television is out again. I'll take a look tonight. Before 6 p.m., all right? All right! Good morning, miss. Good morning. - You're here. - Good morning. - Good morning, Ms. Zhang. - Good morning. - Bye. - Don't forget your pills. - Bye. - Bye. - Good morning, Mr. Sun! - Hello. The test results look promising for now. Continue with the same prescription. The cough you talked about... I don't think that's to do with the CHD. But my mom coughed all the time when she was alive too. Her case was quite different from your sister's. Despite being hereditary, the symptoms can vary considerably. But her breath runs short every time it rains. Is that normal? She's too young for her cardiorespiratory system to be fully developed. Also, with her congenital heart disease, it's normal to get short of breath when air pressure is low. Don't worry. - But sometimes after intense exercise... - She's six now? Yes. Better complete the operation before turning eight, like I've told you a dozen times. Despite exhibiting very limited symptoms now, the situation will worsen once she's past eight. It will get even more complicated if you keep putting it off. You'd better get the operation money fast. You're late. - You're early. - Be careful. NICE VIEW MOBILE PHONE REPAIR Hello and welcome.

ZHAO ZHENCHANG, THE FUTURE OF SHENNING Yes? All right. Sir? He'll see you now. This way. Okay. I told you, we don't buy back phones. I'm not asking you to do that, Mr. Li. Just buy the parts I salvaged. And what would I do with those? For secondary products, like certified refurbished phones, you can make a whole industry chain. I looked it up, there's a huge market based on overseas reports. And I should do what they do? We don't have people to salvage phone parts. That's not a problem. I can do the salvaging. There's also quality control, which you won't pass. I can. I promise. On what? You're just a repair guy. I wouldn't even agree to see you if it weren't for your daily pestering. Mr. Li, I don't think what I do is relevant. Can I take it that if I pass quality control, you'll take my parts? You won't. I will. Okay. Just let me pass. Gosh, that's complicated. Sure it is. Dismantling it isn't enough. I'll have to ensure they pass quality control as well, which requires my parts to be in good condition. Screens, motherboards, CPUs, memory boards, and cameras are just the larger parts. There are still many smaller parts. Goodness... This... Are all these phones on you? Alone? Not a chance. This is the dismantling manual for the 4S model. Once I finish the manual for C8, I'll hire a bunch of people, then they can do it for me. My friend, you're a damn scientist. No, not really. All it takes is meticulousness and patience. You could do it too. Stop that! With my elementary education? I can't even break chicken bones properly. So what if you have little education? Don't let your past define you. Show some confidence, buddy. All right! Don't call me buddy. I'm not here for this, not for your inspirational crap. I'm here for my money. When are you going to pay me back? I'm telling you, had I carried a weapon today, I would... Either you kill me right now or you give me one more week. By then, I'll be finished with these, pass quality control, and get my advance. I'll definitely pay you back. One week. Okay. There's no need to get worked up. But if you don't have the money by then, I'll just take everything in here and you can kiss your little business goodbye. No problem. Little guy, you've got some knack for business. It's just that sometimes, you get a bit too aggressive. Remember, one week.

Stop saying that. I need a new scheme in five days. - Yes. - Hi, Mr. Zhao. I'd like to make a proposal for a spare parts recollection chain. There's a huge market for it. It's on the rise overseas. You could be the pioneer in China. Think about it. The prospects are highly promising. To combat refurbishing, it's better if you could cut off the source. Recycled parts can make secondary products. It will be a seller. Mr. Zhao, just give me ten minutes. - That's all I need. - I don't have ten minutes for you. I'm catching the 3 p.m. train. I'll be back in a month.

Did you plan on selling the parts back from the beginning? No. You wanted to make a fortune out of refurbished phones, but with the new law, you weren't able to sell any, were you? That's right. I thought so. Why do you think what you have here is worth my time? But if it works, you can make it into an industry chain. - It's very promising. - It's not that simple. Do you quit whenever things get hard? No one has done this in China. That's why you're not going to try it? What are you, their subsidiary? What's your name? Jing Hao. How old are you? I am 20. Such a big ambition for such a young boy. But you should already give it up. Why? Leaving aside the plausibility of the industry chain, you wouldn't even be able to retrieve all the parts and keep them intact. What if I could? Do you promise to take them? I would take them if you could do it. - Thank you, Mr. Zhao. - One more thing. No advances. Take care of the dismantling yourself. I'm not providing plants or workers either. If the parts fail quality control, you won't get a dime. Business card. Contact him if you are ready. LI PING, SOUTH CHINA CONSUMER BUSINESS OPERATIONS MANAGER He reached out to you before? Yes, several times. Interesting. How old were you when you came to Shenzhen? Right after getting my master's degree. I was 25. I was about his age when I first came here. In a blink, a fishing village turned into a concrete jungle. Everything is possible in this place. Yes. Stop with all the yeses. Might as well get your scheme right. Yes. Here. Sorry, I'm late. It's okay. Sorry if I held you up. I live here anyway. It's okay. I'm so sorry. Say goodbye. Bye, Mr. Sun. See you. Where's your scooter? It's broken. I sent it in for repairs. Does it hurt?

They live in cybercafes. They want nothing but to play games and get by, let alone work. Most of them already sold their ID cards, living on no more than five yuan a day. Why does this one want a job? - He got a girl, a local one. - Save it for me. Crazy enough to want to marry him. So he now wants an actual job. - Mr. Han. - Greet your boss. Sir. This one. Hello, sir. I'll introduce myself. I'm Liu Hengzhi. I can stay up real late. I'm currently holding the record in this cybercafe for the longest all-nighters in a row. Sixteen weeks. Do you still need more workers? I persuaded my best friend to join me. Sure. Zhang Chao? Wind Chaser? Turn to the next page. Sir? On page 22, there's no solder point on subboard lines, so what's the point of an air gun? We're not heating the points, but the adhesive on the back. Don't set the temperature too high or you'll burn the subboard. Why aren't you listening? I am, with my eyes closed. - Well... - Where was I? Don't burn the subboard. We need to burn the subboard. Fool... Wake up. This is not that easy. What? I don't sleep. You were snoring. Zhong heard you were setting up a factory and decided to help you out. They say they have something to offer, but really, they just have nothing to do anyway. Will it do? The four in the back aren't able to dismantle phones, so they want to be temporary workers. Earn what you can spare, right? Yes. What about Mr. Zhong? Do you know what he used to do for a living? I spent half of my life dealing with clockwork. Just look at this. No one could do a finer job. A fine job, all right. But do you have to take out every component? It's useless now. You could have told me sooner. I did. You just didn't hear me. All right. I'll put them back on then. Ready?

You're still young and can become big and tall, right? Tongtong. Remember, as long as we work hard, nothing is impossible. We're still a little behind schedule. We're already faster than last month. We should get faster and faster. If that's the case, I'll do more tonight. This is last month's rent. For the utility bills, could you please speak to Mr. Yang later? I will ask Ma Yue for more work this month and pay by the middle of the month. Fine. Who are you looking for? Is that pile of cell phones outside yours? Yours?

Forget about it. Just leave. What is he up to? To lure me into some sort of electronic alchemy. Electronic alchemy? Soaking the electronic components in some chemicals to wash out precious metals. It seems that it can make a lot of money. It's not about money. It is illegal. Right. Safety first. Why did you deduct 100 yuan from my salary? You worked fewer hours every day last month. You missed five days of work without telling me. You should be thankful. I had to help my alliance with dungeons. You should have at least given me a heads up. I'll tell you next month. Then I'll give you the salary next month. What? You are not going to give me now? It won't be fair to others. How will I manage this factory? Spare it, don't put me off with your manager duties. You're the factory manager, so what? I'm the president. All you got are a few containers and broken tables. Yet you call yourself a manager? - Zhang Chao, that's enough. - Why should I stop? It's not fair! This dump doesn't even have air conditioning. The cybercafe is better than this. Are you done? If you want to do it, do it well. Or you can leave. You'd better remember this. I quit on my own initiative. I'm not fired by you. - Zhang Chao. - Let go! Zhang Chao! Who cares? Don't be mad, Boss. He is out of his mind. Never mind. Let's get back to work. Stop watching. Go back to work. Mr. Liang, this is for last month's utility bills. Give it to Mr. Yang when he comes. Do you still have money for yourself? I do. I've set up a factory recently, so I'm in a bit of a tight spot. Your business has nothing to do with me. Tell me, how many times have you delayed paying rent? Mr. Wang, please give me a few more days. - I'll do my best... - Do your best? You've been delaying for two months. Tell me now, when exactly will the rent be paid? Hello, Mr. Wang? I can't hear you. - My signal is poor. - Haozi, don't play tricks with me. - I'll talk to you later. - Listen, - if you don't pay the rent, I will... - Thank you, Mr. Wang. Bye. Who are these people? They came for Ms. Wang. Over there, they are talking. They don't look like good men. They were sent by her former employer. She's in the middle of a lawsuit. I guess they want her to drop the case. They've been here several times. Were there so many of them here before? Not really. Ask them to leave. You know I won't sign it. We are both just working for someone else. Don't give me a hard time, okay? Your life is on track now. What else do you want? Why do you think my life is good? I haven't heard my son calling me for years. Do you think that's good? Well, you can hear us talking now, can't you? I am wearing a hearing aid. Then just keep them on. It's only a few hundred yuan, right? My son skipped breakfast for a year to save money to buy it for me. Such a good son. Who's responsible for my ear injury? - It's definitely not mine. - Whose is it then? - Whose is it? - It's definitely not mine. My job is to get you to sign this so that I can leave. Understand? I've said it many times. I won't sign it. How come everyone else can sign but you? - Are your ears so valuable? - Yes. My ears are that valuable. So many years without protective equipment, our ears are damaged. If I sign it, you will never treat workers as human beings. You are just a damned worker. Don't try to challenge the factory. - Yes, I'm just a worker. - You have to sign it today no matter what. - I'm just a worker. - Do you understand? I won't sign it. For the last time, I won't sign it. Go back and tell your boss to wait until the court decides. Wait for the court's decision? Come back. Did I say you can leave? Did I let you leave? Sign it. - Don't touch me. - I did, so what? - Don't touch me. - What are you going to do about it? - Don't touch me. - Damn you... Damn you! How dare you fight back? You are quite brave. How many times have I told you? I'll tell you. You are only making this hard on yourself. Who the hell are you? Who the heck are you? I am her factory manager. What are you waiting for? Get them!

Look at them, you guys have gone too far. I'm sorry. We shouldn't have done it. Boss, don't apologize. They started to pick on our female colleague first. Why should we apologize? Sir, what are you complaining about? If you hit harder, you would be detained like them. You're just bluffing. That's it. Write a guarantee and then you can leave. I'm sorry for all the trouble today. It's my treat... Tonight. I will hold a banquet too. I'm getting married on the 3rd of next month. Getting married?

Boss, it was my fault before. I was acting stupid. I'll make it up to you by chugging down a beer for you. It was a mistake. I'll down it all. There's not a drop left. Just take a sip. I'll take a sip. Just a sip. That's it. That's enough. No more. You finish it. I'll drink it up! Boss. Can I still work for you? Jing Hao, can you drink with me? No problem. Cheers! After this whole thing is done, what do you want to do? You already know. I want my sister cured. I mean for yourself. What do you want to do for yourself? Maybe... I would go back and finish college. Jing Hao. PAY THE RENT TO OPEN THE DOOR! I'm with my sister now. Please open the door first. No way. What if you dash with your stuff the moment I open the door? I have lived here for two years. Where can I go? I don't care. Pay the three months' rent you owe. Then move out. I really don't have the money now. - Just give me a few more days and I'll... - Enough. If you don't pay the rent, don't even think about taking away your luggage. Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is busy now. Please try again later. Jing Hao. I'm sleepy. Where are we going to sleep tonight? Keep your voice down. Don't let the boss hear you. Sorry for the trouble, ma'am. It's okay. I am on the night shift today. You can sleep in my bed. Thank you, ma'am. Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is busy now. Please try again later.

Shuffle and deal the cards. - Why are you here? - You tell me. I've been looking for you all night! - You kept hanging up on me. - What's with you? You're gambling here when you still owe me? Let's go. Pay me back. - I'll hit you... - Let's go! - Let go. - Go! Pay me back! What's wrong with you? Go! Don't touch me! I can go by myself. Go then. - Move. - I can go by myself. When I said, "Look for it yourself," you really did. Don't you think you're going too far, Jing Hao? What a great friend you are. Friend? - Is this all you have? - Yes. I lent you money because you said your mom was ill. Was she even sick? You really would make up all kinds of lies. Gambling bastard. Like you never gambled? Your bets had much higher stakes. If you lose the bet, you will lose your sister! What am I supposed to do? You tell me! What else can I do, but gamble? Can't the landlord give you more leeway? I owe him three months' rent and only paid a small part of it. If you and the neighbors hadn't helped me, he wouldn't even have handed back my stuff. Besides, it's nice here. We have water and electricity. Don't worry. Anyway, if you need anything, just tell me, okay? Bye. Jing Hao. Why aren't we staying at Mr. Liang's? We have already stayed for two nights. We can't bother them too much. Right? Are you feeling better? It's time for bed. Aren't you going to sleep? I'll work right next to you. Will you always be here? I am always with you.

We're catching up. By the way, how long have we delayed the factory's rent payment? It should've been paid last week. Mr. Yang has called me several times. Don't worry about it. The cleaning team will pay me early next month. I'll give him the rent and utilities then. Fine. I'll talk to him. Okay. Jing Hao. Jing Hao. Do you want to pee? - I'll get you a potty. - There's a noise outside. Stay here and don't move. - Why is someone living here? - How do I know? Run! Hey! What are you two doing? Run! Stop! Stop!

Why would you risk your life just for a bunch of old phones? It's not worth it. It is. Take off your gloves. And the other one. How many days have you been working like this? Three days. Damn you! What are you doing? Today, you dropped a bucket. Tomorrow, you could kick the bucket. Don't you know the rules? How dare you work when you're injured! Did you forget how Xu died? Put away your equipment and get out of here. Let me work until the end of this month. I really need the money. And you're risking your life for it? Go! Wait. Payment for three days of work. This is more than three days'. Just go, my friend. Thank you, Ma Yue. Jing Hao. Come here. This is for the utility bills. What about the rent last month? It should have been paid half a month ago. Can I pay you back when the work is done? Do you want an extension again? - No. - Jing Hao. I've been nice to you, haven't I? When have you ever paid your rent on time? Also, how much trouble you've caused recently? Did I let you pay for the gate? And how many times have the cops shown up here? How can I explain it to my clients? Will you pay me for my losses when you're done? Mr. Yang. I'm really having a hard time. I'm so sick of this. Who isn't having a hard time? Do you think you're the only one? We are all having it rough! I'll give you three days. Either you pay me the rent for two months or you leave. It continues to rain during the day throughout the city. The daily rainfall in some areas has exceeded 100 mm. According to the latest forecast of Shenzhen Meteorological Bureau, the super typhoon Utor will pass through the city earlier than predicted. There will be strong winds and heavy rainfall throughout the city. All schools and employers are requested to provide flood-prevention preparations for those who are already in school or on duty. Please give me a small advance. I can charge 50,000 yuan less for the total amount. No way. It's 100,000. Do you think you are at a flea market? Haggling like that? Mr. Li, please help me this time. - I recently... - It's not up to me. You promised Mr. Zhao not to ask for an advance. Then give me his phone number. I'll talk to him myself. Have you ever wondered why he gave you my business card? It's because he doesn't want you to contact him at all. The reason why he signed with you was because you earned his respect at that time. If he sees the way you are now, do you think he will still pay any attention to you? I was right about you. You are just an overambitious wage earner. You dare to say yes to everything, but you can't get anything done. Now get out. If the typhoon comes, you won't be able to leave. Mom. Do you want some water? Do you know that I'm leaving this world? I don't want you to go. I don't want to go either. I will take good care of Tongtong. You must also take care of yourself. I rented the container to others. You have three days to move out. When the rain stops, I'll get someone to clean out your stuff. Then you can come to take it away. Boss! What a mess! The wind was strong last night. This Utor is quite impressive, isn't it? Are our goods all right? We did such a good job of waterproofing, - there must be no problem. - Definitely. That tarp is pretty thick. Why are you sitting here? There are only two weeks left before delivery. I can't pay your salary. The factory has been taken away and rented to others. We have to move out in three days. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry, everyone. Boss. We have heard about the difficulties. It's just about the wages and factory. You are not the only one in our factory. We are all employees of this factory. That's right. Why do you treat us like outsiders? Let me make a stand first. You can pay me the wage after the work is done. That's fine with me. Me too. I'm fine with it. - Me too. - I'm pretty fine with it. I don't even need to be paid. Don't worry about the factory either. - We've worked it out. - Yes. No employer dared to hire me after I left prison, so I've always been working at home. I have also done some outsourcing. Each of us can get some work to do at home. My roommates can also help. We can definitely meet the schedule. Yes. We are already skilled workers. By the way, what about the goods under the shed? It's not a big deal. I'll call my wife to give a hand. You know what she does for a living. That shed is nothing to her. My wife is also coming to help. We'll pack everything up and take it with us today. I've talked to the old folks at the nursing home, they'd love to have you there. It's all solved. - Yes, let's do it. - What are we waiting for? Wait a minute, there is one more thing. Boss. What do you think? Honey, you're awesome! - Go! - Go! - Go! - Go! - Okay, stop! - Stop! NICE VIEW Honey, let's go! Okay! NICE VIEW ELECTRONIC COMPONENT FACTORY Jing Hao. Why are you awake?
