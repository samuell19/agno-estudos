Kids go to instant stardom today. You have basically people combing the internet looking for people, whether they're talented or not. You know, you got people that just have the accumulated audience, like the eyeballs, and those are the people that they sign. When they start going live on their forums and stuff like that, it's not even about being creative, it's about being reckless, it's about being crazy. All right, everybody, let's move in. Copy. - Hands in the air now! - Oh, my God! What the fuck? We got tipped off that you guys were aliens living in the US illegally. We are US citizens. - We're from Puerto Rico. - Stop lying, Mrs. Gomez. My last name is not Gomez. Diaz, Hernandez, Fernandez, Guatemarez. I'm sure it's one of those ez's. - It's not one of those. - Fuck, it's Cruz. Cruz, and we're not undocumented! - Cruz. - Cruz, I feel like I said that. - Yeah, I think you did, too. - Why the fuck - are you guys in my home? - I would lower your voice, Mr. Cruz, you and your familia are getting deported. What the fuck are you talking about? - Check our IDs. - Hey, let's get this family - back to Tijuana. - I got 'em, yo! My family thought they were gonna be deported. Another brilliant prank by a prank master. Subscribe for more. Oh shit! All right, guys, my girlfriend's sound asleep in the bed right now. I just filled this with hot lemonade. I'm gonna squeeze it all over her face and act like I'm peeing on her. Are you fucking kidding me? It's just a squeeze bottle, not my penis. Man, that shit was crazy, seeing all that pee on that girl face. I mean, I knew it was lemonade, but imagine you were sleeping and all of a sudden you wake up to somebody - pissing on your face. - Benito Cruz was quickly becoming one of the edgiest and most popular pranksters. He was doing edgy stuff, yeah, but that shit was funny. Was he breaking the law? That's questionable. Oh yeah, definitely, 100 percent, but far be it from me to discourage an artist - from making art. - On the real though, Benito Cruz was the one who inspired me to become a YouTuber. - That nigga was sick. - I think I might have an infection or something. What do you mean? Promise not to tell Mom, okay, I just... - Okay, let's see it. - Look, it's right here. Right here... eat my crotch! Why, you little... That was funny. You know his dad actually sued him for that? That was... yeah, that was my first high-profile case. But, my team and I worked hard on the perfect defense. See, if Mr. Cruz's face is in Benito's crotch, that's sexual molestation. Case drop, son. Fucking brilliant, right? Benito was crushing it. The crazier the stunt, the more his fan base grew. But then, he went too far. You want me to get you a paramedic or something? Uh, no, just can you do me a favor? Yeah, yeah, what's going on? What's going on? Eat my crotch! Nigga, that shit was funny as fuck. It was funny for all but one person, the police officer. He ended up pressing assault charges. Famous social media star Benito Cruz gets in major trouble with his latest prank. Video got 29 million views, though. The media coverage was insane. His channel gained over 5 million subscribers. The more controversy surrounding the incident, the more popular he became. Social media star is sentenced to three to five years in jail for assaulting a police officer. He was killing the social media thing. But, he was definitely gonna go to jail. Hey. You the kid with the funny videos? You put the police officer's face in your crotch? Yeah. Respect, holmes. Hey, tonight, Imma put your face in my crotch. You feel me, puto? Sit up straight. No, no, I'm good. Okay, let's begin. My name is James Matos. I was his best friend. Actually, I was his only friend. Yo, what up, everybody, it's yours truly, the people's champ, J Rhythm right here on another Dirty Night Radio, and today we have a very special guest, the one and only Lil Tito in the building. - Hey. - What up, man? Welcome, my brother, thanks for coming out. Of course, man, you know I always make time for the little people. When Benito Cruz came out of jail, he was a different person. Prison had hardened him. He didn't wanna be called Benito anymore. He wanted to be referred to as Lil Tito. He also looked a lot older. Well, I guess let's start out in the beginning, my dude. Tell us how this evolved and how Lil Tito came to be. You know what I mean, it's like, Lil Tito just is, man. You don't ask God how He evolved. You know what I'm saying, so it's just Lil Tito in the beginning, and then in the end it will be Lil Tito. Lil Tito was somewhat of a music phenomena. He walked out of jail and two weeks later, he was on Billboard 100. You just spent some time in jail. - Facts, yo. - What was that like? Yeah, that shit was crazy, you feel me? What... what was crazy about it? Everything. Um, I guess what I'm trying to say is, what was your experience like? Insane, man, say less, you know what I mean? I mean, you ain't saying nothing at all. It's like this, Rhythm, man, I mean, like, you, um... Imagine, like, one day you just rolling around free, right? And then, they take you, man, and they put you in this building, and they say, "Yo, you gotta stay here for a certain amount of years, and you can't leave this building, and you, like, gotta live, sleep, breathe, and shower in this building." - That's what it's like. - Well, yeah, that's... that's jail. Like, but, what was that like for you? Really crazy. The music industry was fascinated by his instant success. What people didn't understand is that, while Benito was in jail, kids were discovering his videos. Pranksters were shouting Benito out, and in many circles, he was considered the prank legend. Benito Cruz was like the Jordan of pranks. Yeah, I was managing the accounts, and these videos kept getting millions and millions of views. Well, with Benito being in jail, I would make sure all the money went into an account, and then I would take that and transfer that into a trust fund, so when Benito... sorry, "Lil Tito" got out of jail, his money was just waiting for him. I mean, I did that all for 80 percent plus expenses. Industry standard. So, while you were locked up, some fan started a whole Free Cruz campaign. How did that make you feel about, like, getting all that support? Good. Would you like to elaborate? Really good. - Okay. - I mean, while Lil Tito was incarcerated, I came up with this great idea to sell T-shirts. I mean, it was obviously to bring awareness to the unfair, unjust incarceration of Benito Cruz. What can we say as a community when a police officer overreacts to the innocent act of having his face shoved in a young man's crotch. So today, we ask for your support for young Benito Cruz. Free Cruz. Unfortunately, the campaign didn't go as planned. $15.99. I'll be in the parking lot in... 12 minutes. Free Cruz! - Yes? - I want free cruise now. - Yeah, Free Cruz. - Yeah, free cruise. - Disneyland! - No, no, no. Free Cruz from jail. Not... not a free cruise. - Free cruise. - Free Cruz. - Free... yeah! - Cruz. No, no, Free Cruz, the name Cruz. - What time? - No. Free Cruz. - Yeah. - Thank you. Cruz, the name, not a fucking ship. - A ship, ship. - No. All right, fuck this. - What? - A bunch of tourists thought we were just giving out free cruises. I mean, yo, I dropped two singles that are currently on Billboard 100. Tell me what other artists is doing that right now. Well, tell us about the track "Vyagrra." What was the concept behind that? Well, it's like this, man, you know what Viagra's about, - right? - Yeah. You never had to use that, right? No, no, I didn't. Well, you know, Viagra's for limp-dick motherfuckers, you know what I'm saying, they're soft, you know what I mean, and I feel like the whole rap game right now is limp-dick soft. So, Lil Tito's a motherfucker like Viagra gonna come and harden this shit up, you know what I'm saying? - You feel me? - Yeah, okay. Yo, one week out. One week out and my shit has skyrocketed to the top of the motherfucking charts. I did in one week what you bitch-ass rappers can't do in a whole fucking rap career. So, let it be known, your boy Lil Tito has arrived. It's easy to sign somebody after they have hits, you know what I'm saying, and it's also easy to have hits when you're on a fucking major label, you know what I'm saying, but I did that shit completely 100 percent independent. We ain't trying to sign with just any label, we're trying to sign with hustlers like us, - you know what I'm saying? - Okay, one of the bigger problems that Lil Tito has is, in my opinion, you know, he signed to Cocaine Tony. How long have you been in the music business? Ever since I got out of jail. So, why did you go to jail? Oh, I was falsely accused of selling drugs. How were you falsely accused? I got pulled over and had 22 kilos in the back of my Prius. Technically, the drugs weren't even mine. I was just bringing 'em from one dude to another dude. I was like a Uber driver. - But, for cocaine. - His name is Cocaine Tony, you know, so, and that ain't just a nickname. Isn't that distribution? That's what the judge said. Ah, but the case was thrown out a few months after. Why? Oh, the arresting officer slipped and accidentally shot himself. Five times in the stomach, then he fell off a five-story building. All right before my court date. It was such a tragedy. Congratulations, welcome to BBW Records. Thank you, thank you. So, um, you know, where's my, uh, $5 million check. Check? It's no check. What, what you mean, I thought this was a $5 million deal. Oh, it is, you'll be receiving $5 million in services. See, now you have a team. Team that could take you to the next level, and that's the shit money can't buy. Now, we are giving you $5 million in connections. Not to mention, using all our resources to make sure that the Lil Tito brand becomes a household name. It's like you getting a $10 million deal, you feel me? We did make you a customized chain, huh. My God, man, those diamonds is dancing. Yes, I know, speechless. - "EAD"? - "Eat a dick." Your slogan. Mhm. Yeah, feel it. Yo, you know my slogan is "Eat my crotch"? "Eat a dick" is harder. "Eat a crotch" is... it's not aggressive enough, you know? We need something to sound hard when it comes out your mouth. So, "dick" sound harder coming out the mouth? Your mouth. - Eat a dick. - Eat a dick. Yeah, try it on, man. - That shit heavy, yo. - Mhm, it's almost real. - Eat a dick. - Eat a dick. - Eat a motherfucking dick. - Twice. If there were one word to describe Lil Tito... "extreme." Everything Lil Tito did was over the top. Always about outdoing the rest. There was this one rapper, his name was Lil Montana, he brought in this exotic tiger from Africa. Let's just say Lil Tito found a way to top him. I feel like, you know, anyone can have exotic animals as pets, but you tell me one person who got exotic humans as pets. Yo, I wanna introduce you to Milo and Mila. One's a boy pet and one's a girl pet. Usually I could tell because, you know, I just kinda flip 'em over and look between their legs. You hungry? Hungry? Come on, you guys wanna go out for a walk? Don't judge me, bitch. I make $5,000 a day pretending like I'm a fucking dog. Hm, I'm making good money making sure I don't have to degrade myself. Do you feel like sometimes you might go too far? We going too far is how we were successful, - you know what I'm saying? - Lil Tito comes out of jail, records two songs, and immediately has two enormous hits on his hands. While I was in jail, I had a lot of time to reflect on my life and think about my future. God spoke to me. He was the One that suggested that I be a rock star. Being a rapper is like being a modern-day rock star, you know what I mean, plus, I don't really know how to play an instrument, so I'm like, "Damn, that shit is perfect for me." Yeah, yeah, we spoke every night before I, uh... I went to sleep. Of course, I mean, uh, he was in the bunk below mine. God was this big, fat Black dude. He was my cellmate. He got locked up for shooting some dude at. Stole his or some shit. The irony is they call him God, and he shot that dude under the. That shit's pretty funny. Not for the dude he shot, but... it's funny. Man, I can't wait to see these thotties, bro. Yo, LT, who's directing this shit anyway? Yo, the label's got some young hot-shit director. Supposed to be real official. Oh, word. Yo, what's up, man, you sure this is the right place? Oh, this the address you sent me, bro. What's up, man, how's my favorite artist doing, man, what's up, man, you ready to get this? - Yeah. - Yo, where's everybody at? Oh, don't worry about it, big dog, they'll be here. You... you just worry about killing them performances. Here's my G right now, man. - Yo, who's that? - That's the director. Look, don't let the youth fool you. This kid is a film genius. Want you to meet Lil Tito. - Hey, what's up, bro? - Yeah. It's an honor to meet you, I'm such a big fan. All right, all right. Now that the two creative gurus are together, let's make some cinematic magic. - Yeah, let's do it. - Yo, can we pause for a second? - Yo, can I holler at you? - Yeah. My man, my dude, what's going on, man? You getting a little nervous? No, it's not that, I'm just saying, uh, this kid looks like he's in high school. Look, I thought we was doing, like, an official music video, you know what I'm saying, I thought we was gonna have like cameras, crew, guns, girls. We got none of that. I mean, I got a gun in the car. And Danny, he's got the latest iPhone, and that's got a dope camera. Got Portrait mode. And we can all call up some hoes. Yo, there's no thotties here, man. Man, you saying there's not even one bitch over there? - Nah. - I think you getting wrapped up on how things used to be. Shit is all digital now. What he's gonna do with the effects is gonna be super amazing. You seen the new Star Wars? - Yeah. - Shit was lit. FYI, all shot on the new iPhone. You serious? But, it's amazing what they can do with the CG nowadays, man. CG doesn't just stand for "computer generated." It also stands for "crazy good." Now, go out there and CG that shit, man. ♪ Ay, you think I don't hear y'all talking ♪ ♪ Talking about Tito, like, "Fuck Tito this" ♪ ♪ And "Fuck Tito that," well shit ♪ ♪ Fuck me, fuck you ♪ Lil Tito has enormous amounts of streams on SoundCloud, YouTube, Instagram, and his following was insane. But now, he has to legitimize himself as an official artist. Not just an internet sensation. Yo, being able to drive down the highway and hear my record being played on the radio, that's mad important to me. Everybody in the music industry knows, you wanna get your record on the radio, there's only one promoter you fuck with: Radio Dave. ♪ I'm harder than these rappers, yo ♪ ♪ I'm stronger than these rappers ♪ ♪ Lil Tito, my Vyagrra, fuck you ♪ ♪ Lil Tito fuck a bitch he-a bust in ♪ ♪ Everybody on my dick like a bus now ♪ So, what you think? Yo. Yo. That shit was horrible. That was utter garbage, man. That was the crappiest shit I've ever seen. You can't put that out as your first video, man. That look like somebody shot that shit on the iPhone. That's 500 grand down the drain. - Wait, what? - Look, Lil Tito, man, if you sign with me, I'll make sure your music get on every fucking radio station all across the globe, and I ain't gonna lie to you. There's a formula to this shit, and I know it like the back of my hand, but it's gonna take some work and some fucking money. Oh, don't worry, he got money. Wait, wait, don't the label pay for the promotions and stuff? - No, oh no. - No, no. Usually the artist fronts that part. Yeah, I mean, we could, but that would be a conflict of interest, and well, that's illegal. Wait, how is that a conflict of interest? Well, it's a conflict against my interest. Lil Tito, nobody knows what you're all about. The only thing the public knows is what they see on the internet, and we need to create the narrative. - Mm. - Where you from, man? The Valley... I mean, Valley Village exactly, yo. No, no, Valley Village? Ain't no certified hardcore gangstas coming up - out of Valley Village. - Well, he's not a certified - hardcore gangster. - Who are you? You the homeboy? You the mike checker, 1, 2, 1, 2, side nigga. No, man, I'm just his best friend. Well, best friend, let me do what I do. Tito, the music industry is not the same today. People don't care about the music anymore. It's about what show you put on. That's what the people wanna see. It's reality TV, all day, every day. You from the hood, can you vouch for him? Yeah, we get some goons, we vouch for you. - You'll be fine. - Wait, hold on, - so you want me to lie. - It's not lies as much as it's small exaggeration. Right? There's too many gaps here. We're just writing the narrative. But, let me ask you something, Lil Tito, you wanna become stupid rich? You wanna sip champagne for breakfast? Huh? Rock $100,000 Breitlings. Smash exotic women across the globe, places you can't even pronounce. - 100 percent. - That's what I'm offering. All I'm saying is everyone exaggerates a little bit. A little white lie ain't gonna hurt no one. I just don't think you gotta do all that, like, extra shit, - you know, just do you. - I am doing me, man. Me is always that extra shit, look at all the videos. That's always been the extra shit. That whole South Central shit, the whole "I'm a gangsta" stuff. Come on, man, that's not who you are. All right, look, yo, all I'm saying is, people buy into image, and that's all we giving them is an image, all right? I'm a showman, and all I wanna do is go out there and put on a fucking show. And I'm gonna put on the best fucking show possible. That's it, man, and it's gonna work. Every internet rapper wants to cross over into the mainstream, to have their records on the radio and to be weaved into pop culture. But, that transition can be tough. From jail to overnight success, Lil Tito's stardom was more than just a phenomenon. What people call trolling is me speaking my mind. This is Beyond Da Music. Lil Tito climbs to the top of the charts, but before Lil Tito became an overnight celebrity, the mean streets of LA is what he called home. Benito was always a good boy. When I was young, I was always getting into trouble. The teachers, they would always tell me what a pleasure he was to have in school. My teachers always told me I would never amount to shit, - you know? - My husband and I worked hard to make sure that we provided a good home for Benito - and his sister. - You know, my mom was a crackhead, you know, she used to take the rent money to buy crack to smoke, and my father, you know, he used to beat me. You know, he would call me names, like "stupid," you know what I mean, and, uh, he would make racial slurs against me. Yeah, yeah, he was racist. He was a happy little boy, and we were a happy little family. I had a fucked up childhood. ♪ Lil Tito fuck ya bitch, inside this hoe ♪ ♪ Ask anybody... ♪ You know, there's a lot of shit going on, and a lot of parties and stuff, but now that I'm signed, I'm just focusing on my album. Do I think Lil Tito could transition into a mainstream artist? I mean, shit, if he pays my retainer. Hell yeah, why not? All right, so we're just gonna need one more signature - right here. - All right, I got you. Aight, we good. So, last but not least, I'm gonna just need that, uh, - that check. - Oh yeah, I got you, I got you. So, uh, yo, who do you want me to make this check out to? Uh, Got You Sucka Incorporated. - Got You Sucka? - Incorporated. - Why you name your company that? - Ah, you know, it's just... it just means, "I got you," you know what I'm saying? It's like, "Radio Dave got you... sucka." - Sucka? - Yeah, sucka. Uh, it's like OG slang for "my nigga." You kinda know that means something different right now? Yo, I heard you was in the studio. Yeah, yeah, yeah, man, we recorded "Vyagrra" the remix. - Shit sound tough, yo. - Ooh, I know it does, man. That's crazy, but now, yo, remember, aight? We need you to make some motherfucking noise, aight? Stir the pot, we need to create some damage on the internet, 'cause, you know, controversy and beef, - that brings... - Clicks and streams. Clicks and streams, that's what I'm talking about. So, yo, so you want me to start a beef with a rapper, right? Yeah, but not just any rapper, okay? We need somebody with some clout. Now, let me ask you something, Tito, are you willing to do whatever it takes to get to the top? Yeah, of course, whatever, man. You willing to take a bullet, maybe, like, in the shoulder? - Wait, what? - I got some real sharp shooters. Okay, they can just graze a little bit off your shoulder, you know what I'm saying, take a little skin off. You won't even need that skin, you can put a tattoo over it. - It's nothing. - Yeah, man, you know what? I'm not down with getting shot, bro. Okay, we'll put a pin in that, but let's talk about something that's more important, and let's keep things in order, aight? Let's talk about the entourage, right? You need to start hanging with some motherfuckers that are eclectic. - Are you white? - Nah, Puerto Rican. Okay, well we need to United Nations that shit on up, so I suggest we add, like, a hardcore Mexican, and maybe, like, two or three Black dudes, some hardcore motherfuckers, like, Darien or fucking Arius. Some shit like that, you know what I'm saying? Then we'll add an Asian with some funky clothes, 'cause you know that shit is in right now, and if we got a little bit more money in the budget, I say we add, like, a funny Indian dude. Yo, you think all that shit is necessary, though? Fuck yeah, it's necessary, dude. But yo, let's talk about the fun shit, though. - The females. - Oh yeah, yeah. Right, because all your fans gonna wanna know who are you smashing, okay? Now, I got a connection to, like, some high-level thotties that I can hook you up with, but I need to ask you a question, and again, I'm just throwing it out there. Will you fuck a Kardashian? Ah, man, I don't know about that. It'd just be for a little while. Yo, in all honesty, my dude, I'd rather get shot. Okay, we're gonna play it safe. We're gonna hook you up with, like an up-and-coming porn star. - Let's do that. - Yo, I got one before you leave, - I got one more question. - So, now that we got all this done, can I start saying the N-word in my music? Absolutely not, but good meeting, man. This check better not bounce. Lil Tito knew that it was his job to start shaking things up. It was clear to me that Lil Tito referring to himself as "The King of LA" was just him trolling, waiting to see if anyone would challenge him. I am the King LA, because you know what I mean, I just claimed it, you know what I'm saying? A king don't wait for somebody to throne him, you know what I'm saying, we just... me and my team, we just claimed the throne and we own it, - you know what I'm saying? - Surprisingly, no one did. Until the video dropped. The video drops... ♪ Off with their heads ♪ ♪ I'm harder than these rappers, harder than these rappers ♪ ♪ Harder than these rappers, Lil Tito on Vyagrra ♪ ♪ I'm harder than these rappers, harder than these rappers ♪ ♪ Harder than these rappers, Lil Tito on Vyagrra ♪ ♪ Fuck you, Tito this, Lil Tito that ♪ ♪ Lil Tito that, motherfucker, watch your back ♪ The video dropped on Wednesday at noon, and by 1:30 in the afternoon, it already received 2.5 million views. He didn't go at one person. This dude made a video going, like, at like four or five rappers all at once. When I sat down to discuss the idea for the video with Lil Tito, it was very clear the message he wanted to come across. He wanted to make the claim and let everyone know that he was king. I suggested a medieval theme. ♪ I'll pull up on these dudes ♪ ♪ Put these pussies on their back ♪ ♪ You can call me Cola, mixed with baking soda ♪ ♪ Drink will make you throw up... ♪ The video was pretty gruesome. He started beheading the heads of rappers and placing them on wooden spikes. Went Game of Thrones on 'em, cut people's heads off, cut... he cut their heads off. That's disrespectful, you understand, I mean, that message that he's sending right there alone, I mean, somebody gonna try... you got now five people - trying to cut your head off. - Nigga, the video was dope. This motherfucker had these sexy-ass White Walkers. Out of the blue, there's this weird shot of him fucking a purple dragon. This nigga was smashing a purple dragon. To each his own. Now, that's a motherfucking video. I thought the video was a bit over the top. But, that's what art is. It's controversy, and you know what's great about controversy? Lawsuits. A fucking shitload of lawsuits. The video had everyone talking. Flight Team, stand up, hey, man, that Lil Tito dude, bro, you crazy. Bro, this man put heads of rappers on a Game of Thrones-looking thing on his latest Vyagrra video. Vloggers, VJs, even morning talk show hosts - were talking about Lil Tito. - See, the video was genius, 'cause it didn't start one beef, it started a series of beefs. If y'all don't respond, bro, you might as well just give this man the crown and just say, "He's the number one artist of all time." Now you got some of the biggest rappers in the game making response videos. ♪ Yo, man, that ghost, I pull up with that strap ♪ ♪ I pull up on these dudes ♪ ♪ Put these pussies on their back ♪ Lil Tito, like... he's like super troll. We do what we gotta do, if my man gotta go suck a dick to get us a deal, he's gonna go suck a dick to get us a deal, you know what I mean? It's just as real as that. Now, I just saw on the Gram that Lil Uzi, he's upset, you know what I mean, 'cause I called his mom a dick-sucking whore. Now, let me ask you question, how upset you think he's gonna be when he finds out I smashed his boo, oh yeah. Sup, baby? These plaques are dope, because whenever I feel a little sad, I could look at them and it just tells me that I'm better than a lot of other people, you know what I mean? Yo, I got this plaque right here, 'cause this picture got a million Likes, you know what I'm saying, so the picture went platinum. A lot of these dudes right now, like, they go back and forth with each other on the internet. They, you know... they troll each other's forums and stuff like that, and they say a lot of crazy, crazy, crazy shit, and the problem is, it's on the internet, so the whole world is watching you cross that line. So, when you cross that line, what's left to do? I mean, at some point somebody gonna get hurt for real. Lil Tito took the beefs to a whole new level. I mean, Lil Tito, he knew how to juice the shit out of his beefs, you know what I'm saying, I mean, just look at what he did to your boy Lil Montana. Lil Montana, whose government name was Daniel Clarkson, was one of the hottest rappers at that time. ♪ Take 'em to the money man, it's like it's free ♪ ♪ Haters hate on me then they rest in peace ♪ Lil Tito, well he decided to make him his main rival. ♪ I can hear the hate, I'm just here to eat ♪ I mean, the guy goes above and beyond the fucking lines of too far. He sent two grimy, grimy, grimy-looking cops to Lil Montana's parents' house. Well, wait, why does that man have a camera? The department requires we tape all visits. It's for your protection, so we don't rob you or beat you up, or that sort of stuff. And they basically bring the news, they say, "Your son was seen leaving the club last night with another man, and allegedly, started performing felatio on this man. And at that point, the driver lost control. "They hit a brick wall, your son was decapitated, and basically, when they discovered him..." He had a penis in his mouth. Ay, Lil Tito, you crazy, bro, I ain't gonna lie. Montana, what you gonna do, man? He came over to your parents' house and everything, what you gonna do, man? You can't let him do you like that, man. But, don't trip, he gonna get his. Payback is a bitch, on God. The visual of all of that stuff just goes too far, you know? Yo, what up, everyone, I woke up this morning to see that stupid-ass dude Blake Skilz posted a track where he mentions my name. Yo, that shit was utter and complete trash. Yo, keep my name out your mouth, you bitch-ass... - Nigga. - He had no boundaries, and now, he was bigger than ever. His trolling antics took him to the top. Lil Tito was officially the biggest thing in music and pop culture. I mean, in all honesty, man, my goal is to be the greatest artist that ever lived, you know? Uh, the richest artist that ever lived. ♪ I'm gonna be here forever, siempre ♪ ♪ I'm gonna be here forever, siempre ♪ ♪ My clip is loaded, don't tempt me ♪ ♪ My clip is loaded, don't tempt me ♪ ♪ I'm gonna be here forever, siempre ♪ ♪ I'm gonna be here forever, siempre ♪ When you're as famous as Lil Tito, you attract a lot of attention, and some of it can be the wrong kind of attention. With celebrity comes women, and a lot of these women were hot, like, these women were really, really hot. I told Lil Tito he had to be careful, 'cause it is not hard for a young man to get in trouble. So, I said, "If you're gonna be out there fucking around, just get protection." I mean this is the best consent form in the business. I mean we got a little legal... legal jargon right here that you just get out of the way. You both gotta sign the bottom of that.

It fucking doesn't matter, as long as everybody initials and signs, turns that into me, we're good. When you're the biggest thing in the entertainment business, people are gonna wanna know who you're dating. Instagram models, actresses, and various female celebrities were all bidding to be Lil Tito's main squeeze. Most of them were just clout chicks. I rep some of the best Instagram models in the world. If you're below 300, you're too basic to be repped by me. Oh, sorry, as in under 300,000 followers. The Instagram modeling business is cutthroat. Not just anyone can do it. First of all, you have to be pretty, and you have to have a phone. Being a professional Instagram model is extremely hard work. I mean, not only do you have to be beautiful all the time, you constantly have to be taking great, sexy pictures, and the captions, they have to be inspiring. I wake up in the morning and I say, "Good morning" to all my fans, because some of them, that's all they have. Then, after that, I go workout, and that can be difficult, because you don't wanna look gross and sweaty. None of your fans should ever have to see that. I spend the rest of the night just entertaining my millions of fans. That could be really hard work, because you always have to be... happy. I tell my girls, "You get out there, you find those rappers, those athletes, those YouTubers, anything you can do to get your numbers up. Because if you can't find people to like your pictures, how are you going to get them to like you? I mean, whatever female Lil Tito chooses, I mean, you best believe her profile gonna go through the roof, so it can't just be some ordinary thotty, you know what I'm saying? Yo, check out shorty right here. Let me see. Oh, she's nice. - What you think? - I mean, look, she's smash-able. She ain't packing six figures. Radio Dave said, "Six figures minimum." You know what you need, my dude? Black girl. Get you a dime-ass Black girl. Fuck these White bitches. - You need a sister. - Yo, my dude, you'd look good with a Black girl. Yo, that zebra shit is in right now, bro. You posting pics officially in a zebra relationship, psh, that shit'll get you mad Likes, B. - You think? - Most definitely. Ayo, peep this, right. So, the White dudes are gonna say,"Damn, homie pulled a sister." - Facts. - Wait, then the sisters are gonna say, "This vanilla-looking motherfucker must be doing something right to pull a sister." Super facts. Plus, then I could say the N-word. Hell no. - Why not? - Yo, my dude, we already been through this, man, the word ain't for you, my nigga. Yo, I don't understand, man, you motherfuckers say that shit all the time, and I'm Puerto Rican - just like you motherfuckers. - But, there's a difference, you see, my ancestors got fucked by Africans. Yours got fucked by Spaniards. Yo. Ooh, yo, who's that? Destiny Sapphire. - Ooh, yeah, she's hot. - Yo, she got, like, 13 million followers. Blazed that last night, though. Ah, blazed it this morning, kid. How y'all blazing? Ah, young man. You got a lot to learn, young man. - Fuck y'all talking about? - Should we put him on? Let me show you something, we're gonna show you something, man, come over here, bro. Destiny Sapphire was the largest virtual reality porn star in the world. Put on the suit, wear the glasses, pick the scenario, and get busy. Oh, she can give you head, ride you, multiply the bitch by three. I've done it. Wait, how do you get off? Well the suit has these electrical pulses, it gives you sensations. Gets you off. I mean, like, how do you... release. Oh, you jizz right in the suit. - Yeah. - But wait, don't you motherfuckers share that shit? Yeah, but we wash it. We don't wash it, wash it, 'cause if you do, you can get electrocuted. But, we use wipes, disinfectant wipes. Yeah. Hm. It wasn't long before Destiny Sapphire and Lil Tito became a thing. Wow, this is amazing. I mean, you look amazing. What did you like about me? That you had a lot of followers. Oh. Well, how did you become a rapper? I don't know, I kinda just fell into it, you know what I mean, started making videos. How'd you get into porn? I thought it would be a great way to springboard my acting career. So, you wanna be an actress? Mhm, I do. I mean, I've been taking some acting classes, but I really just wanna be a serious actress, - like Meryl Streep. - I think you're gonna be very, - very successful. - So sweet. Do you really think I have what it takes? Of course, and you know what they say, sucking dick in Hollywood gets you really far, and you got that shit on lock. The relationship between Destiny and Lil Tito was hot. The internet just got obsessed. I mean, who wouldn't be obsessed with the hottest rapper and the biggest porn star having an affair? It was a train wreck waiting to happen. Please welcome our next guest, hip-hop and internet sensation "Lil Tito." Well, it is a pleasure to finally be able - to meet you. - It is. Lil Tito was on The Hellen Show. He's no longer just an internet sensation. He's become a household name. Yo, if you give me a budget, I'll make any idiot a household name, and that's real talk. Let's talk about your steamy relationship with Destiny Sapphire. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, she's sexy. Well, people are fascinated by you guys. - Oh, 100 percent. - Seems to be going well. Do we hear, uh, wedding bells in your future? Nah, nah, nah, nah, look, look, Hellen. We be smashing, don't get it fucked up, we be smashing, you know what I'm saying? But, you just don't make a hoe into a housewife. Right, that sounds appropriate in this day and age. Wait, wait, what did he just say? Yeah, um, that's not gonna go over well. Rap and internet sensation Lil Tito finds himself in a world of trouble tonight, after a misogynistic comment on The Hellen Show. Yo, but you got a lot of ladies mad at you right now. Yeah, but I don't see why, I don't see why they mad, - you know what I mean? - Usually when an artist offends a group of people, you would think that the proper response would be to issue an apology. Not Lil Tito. He thought it'd be a good idea to double down. I mean, look, man, it's just like this. Let's say you... yo, J, you dating a girl, right? - Yeah. - Let's say you loving this bitch, man, that's your fucking boo... All right, man, my bad, I'm not gonna even call her a bitch. Let's say you loving this thotty and that's your boo, - you know what I'm saying. - Yeah. And you... that's your main squeeze and everything, right, but then you find out that she sucked 367 penises last year. - That's a lot of penis. - How you feel about...? - You gonna marry her? - Nah. Nah, you gonna... yo, my dude, you gonna marry her? - Nah, B. - Yo, son, you gonna marry her? Yo, you gonna marry her? There's a whole studio here. Yo, you gonna marry her? Yo, producer guy, you know what I'm saying? The battle of the sexes turns up as Lil Tito's comments get the fans freaking out. Not sure what's gonna happen, stay tuned. Yo, it was the only thing people could talk about. Everyone was split on the issue. But, one thing was for sure, Lil Tito was becoming more and more popular. Then, he crushed it. Yo this video right here, is about unity, you know what I'm saying. It's about bringing people together but most of all, it represents female empowerment. ♪ I'm not a hoe ♪ ♪ You ain't gotta lie to Lil Tito ♪ ♪ I fuck with you anyway ♪ ♪ If you a hoe just say you a hoe ♪ ♪ I'm not a hoe ♪ ♪ It don't mean I don't like you ♪ ♪ I'm just saying ♪ ♪ It just means like I ain't gonna wife you tho ♪ ♪ I'm not a hoe ♪ ♪ Yeah so why you fuck my friends ♪ ♪ Plus like four, five his friends ♪ ♪ How you really get that Benz, bitch ♪ ♪ I'm not a hoe ♪ ♪ Yeah why you always up on that Gram ♪ ♪ Showing everybody your ass ♪ ♪ How you really getting that cash, hoe ♪ ♪ Lil Tito ♪ ♪ Oh you not a hoe ♪ ♪ Could've fooled me bitch ♪ ♪ I know a hoe when I see one ♪ ♪ You got red up under your kicks ♪ ♪ But no job, no man ♪ ♪ How the fuck you afford that shit, hoe ♪ ♪ Tell the truth, tell the truth ♪ ♪ Tell the truth you suckin' dick ♪ In less than one week the video got over 220 million views.

Now mind you, he hasn't even released his full album yet. But he's gonna go develop a bunch of new artists? Yo, what up everybody. I'm here with the homie, Lil Nasty XX. The first artist on my new music label, LT Music. Lil Nasty XX was a different type of rapper. His niche was... a bit questionable. Lil Nasty XX was the first... porno rapper. That kid's my favorite fucking artists. 'Cause he's a rapper and you know how rappers talk about like getting their dick sucked and fucking bitches. Well, this guy... in his videos rapped and fucked bitches and got his dick sucked. In the fucking video, it's great! Fucking genius. Oh, those videos are so good. I've seen them, uh, once or twice, but they're good. The problem is that when you're under another rapper's label you depend a lot on that rapper's fan base. So Lil Tito's fan base was a demographic of roughly 6 to 80. Lil Nasty XX eventually was arrested for soliciting porn to minors. Lil Nasty XX became the most famous sex offender rapper there was, if that's even a category. Yeah, he called me from jail for legal advice and I was like, "Don't get raped son!" But rape is not a laughing matter... wait, we can cut that... can we just cut that part out and I start over? Is that cool? Lil Tito was never scared of trying new things. He liked being unorthodox. Maybe a little too much. People underestimate me because I come from the streets and look a certain way, you know what I mean. But I'm smart as fuck, you know what I mean. I reads this article where people over 55 are spending a lot of cash. So I'm like, "Yo, what the fuck? Why are we not focusing on getting that money? - You know what I mean? - All right, everybody. I would like to introduce you all to... Lil Tito. Yo, what up, my old ass ninjas. Y'all mother fuckers ready to get turned up? Yo, I said are y'all mother fuckers - ready to get turned up? - Yeah! I said y'all mother fuckers ready to get turned up? - Yeah! - Yeah. I say "Fuck me" and you mother fuckers say "Fuck you." - Ready? - Yeah! - Fuck me! - Fuck you! - Fuck me? - Fuck you! Fuck me? Fuck you! Let's get this mother fucker turned up! Fuck me! Fuck you! Fuck me! Fuck you! Fuck me! Fuck you! Fuck me! Fuck you! Yo, let's go, Tito! I heard that Snoop and Future were throwing out weed in one of their concerts so I thought Lil Tito on the 50 Plus Tour would through out some ED pills. Get your dick hard, old man. Lil Tito, I love you! That's what the fuck I'm talking about. I love you too, Mama. Come to find out that these old mother fuckers is fucking. Yo, old people is dirty. They're the one's spreading the most STD's out of anybody. Yo, Doris, tell them how you get down. I be fucking. Yeah, you do. Yo, tell 'em who got the best head game in this mother fucker. Me, my head game is better than any of these bitches. Yo, I felt like that was the best experience of their mother fucking lives. You know, what I'm saying. I'm here with my original OG mother fuckers, right. In all in all, the 50 Plus Tour went pretty well, you know what I'm saying. Um, yeah, some people died so we had to shut it down because it turns out you can't give ED pills to old men with bad hearts. So you can't have a bad heart and hard dick.

Don't know why they called him Black Bob though. What up hip hop world. It's your boy Black Bob here with my man, J-Escrow. Uh, so tell us about this beef with Lil Tito. I ain't got no beef with that dude. But you called him out on your mixtape. Oh, yeah I him a clout chasing weirdo 'cause that's what the dude is. Look, being disrespectful is not a talent, you feel me. Besides, you can't beef with nobody that's beneath you. That's real, my dude. I fucking love you. Come here, give me some of that love. Yeah, man. Fuck Lil Tito. Fuck Lil Tito. Nah, for real. - Fuck Lil Tito. - Fuck Lil Tito. The next day, the number one trending hashtag was Fuck Lil Tito. Fuck you, Lil Tito. Man, fuck you, Lil Tito. Fuck you, Lil Tito. Fuck you, Lil Tito. Philly in the building real rap. Southside, Englewoods, Chicago. - North Philly. - Lil Tito started to get a taste of his own medicine. J-Escrow was getting under his skin and it started to become obvious. He would make response videos and diss track but it just didn't resonate. Hey look man, first of all, I don't got time for all this little fuckboy shit. But fam, you've become so annoying that now I must end you. So anybody that still follows this clown, check me out. I'm about to expose the truth on who this character really is. So this Friday I'm dropping a video across all my platforms letting you all know about Benito Cruz aka Lil Tito, aka homie yous a fake. Feel me, stay tuned, watch me end you career. J-Escrow had built up the anticipation for this video that was supposedly gonna really expose Lil Tito. It was genius. He made the people wait all week. That mother fucker promoted that shit like it was the next big fight. The question ended up being, "What is there to expose?" The internet went wild. Yo, what does J-Escrow have install for Lil Tito. He's trash, I think J got the ups on him. Hey, I heard you gonna get exposed, my guy. Tomorrow, my guy, you're on that fuckboy goofy shit, my guy. I mean, most people think he's gonna expose the fact that you're gay. I mean, I'm not even gay, my dude. - I know. - But you said the fact. Listen man, I'm just telling you what the internet's saying. So what? The internet's saying that I'm gay? - And that you got a little dick. - That's a good thing, bro. It's a good thing that people think I've got a little dick? No, no it's a good thing that people think you're gay. Gay people support each other, you know what I mean? Your fan base's about to blow up. So what? I'm supposed to pretend like I'm gay? Why not, you've been doing a lot of pretending. Yo, what's that supposed to mean? I don't even know why you're stressing. Just do what you do, let the guy drop the video one day and then you drop the video the next. - That's it. - I'm stressing - 'cause this is my career. - Pause. I got it. Instead of steering away from the skid, - let's slide right into it. - Yo, what does that even mean? Everybody's talking about this shit, right. The numbers are crazy right. Let him drop his video Friday. - Drop an album Saturday. - Wait what? Nah, come on. Yo, that's fucking genius. LT, people are gonna think this whole fucking J-Escrow thing is a hype for your album, dog. They're gonna check it out just 'cause of the controversy. This could be huge for you, bro. I mean... In all honesty I like it. But shit, that only gives me two days to put a whole album together. You already had four hit singles, man. Artists are dropping albums with seven songs on it. You know what I mean? Just cut a couple fenders. Get some interludes, maybe a skid or something. - You good to go. - Yo, you could break records - for stream, my dude. - Nah, nah, nah I disagree man. Right now you need to focus on your project. Whatever this guy says is going to be over by next week. But yo, you got the opportunity right now to... to make a dope ass album. Something that people are gonna love that's gonna last forever. An artist's first album is the most important one. Yo. Focus on music. Fuck the bullshit. Yo, nobody cares about the music, bro. Everybody cares about the bullshit. I say you drop the album, dog. So Lil Tito announces that he's gonna drop his album on that Saturday. A day after J-Escrow releases his expose video. Dropping an album on the cusp of all that controversy. Yo, that shit was brilliant. What up, what up, it's your boy, DJ Stacks. You know I got that exclusive info. I know y'all have been waiting for this. It appears Lil Tito announced he's about to drop his debut album Kola King of LA this Saturday and listen, I'm not even finished yet. This comes right after J-Escrow announced he has very damaging information on Lil Tito on Friday. This can't be good, I hope it ends well. DJ Stacks, stay tuned with me. I'm gonna give y'all more information soon. The video drops at 1 PM and the coverage on it was ridiculous. Now remember, Lil Tito you did this to yourself, bro. Within less than an hour the video went on to receive a million hits. By the end of the day, the video had got ten million views. J-Escrow had delivered on his promise and exposed Lil Tito in a very detailed way. So Lil Tito claims to be this hard ass dude from South Center. But in the hood, nobody knows you and in actuality, bro, you're from Valley Village. I have here a wired transfer the label sent to your so-called goons. I mean, bro, who hires day ones? The video exposed every detail about Lil Tito aka Benito Cruz. His background, where he grew up, even his financial records. Oh, don't worry y'all. I'm gonna post all these documents on the Gram so you can cross reference for yourself. It talked about his time in jail and how he was punked by other inmates. How he even started working for the warden as a snitch. That his label and his manager were stealing all his money. Lil Tito's record contract. Now if this ain't the worst 360 deal I ever seen in my life. Bro, your whole team jerking you. Yeah, it was definitely a hard blow. Why does this dude have a swastika on his face? Like y'all, low-key I feel like everything this dude does has a racist subtext on it and I don't understand how anybody can cosign anything he does. He's got human beings chained up like they pits. What kind of weirdo shit is that? This dude has no talent. He's not funny. His music is trash and fam, over all, you as a human being is super trash and this this guy y'all chose to follow. By the next morning, the video had already reached over 40 million views. And Lil Tito's debut album was just released. Then uh, then the album dropped. The album dropped. Let's just say that it wasn't very well received. So he goes in the studio, in two days and puts together the worst album in rap history. Straight trash. Yeah, shit my niggas, like... right after the album dropped, no lie, it was like 30 minutes and like all these promoters just start cancelling dates and shows and shit. It was like done and niggas was like here then he was here, like within 30 minutes. No exaggeration. People were mean. They were setting pictures of Lil Tito on fire. The internet that created him was now turning against him. Yo, where's he at? His apartment. He's in bad shape, man. Let's go. Smells like shit. Yeah, dude's been pissing himself. He doesn't give a fuck. You guys couldn't clean up? He wouldn't let anyone touch him. That stench? It's coming from him. All right. Give me a minute, let me talk to him. Be outside. So what's the plan? Just gonna drink? Be a drunk all your life? You should just leave. What bothers you more? The fact that people know who you really are or that your album flopped? Fuck off. Good. Good, get it all out. You must be really enjoying this shit. How am I enjoying this? You get to finally see me down, right. You're a real fucking piece of work, you know that? I don't even know what you're doing here, man. No one asked you to fucking come. You think I wanted to be here? Those dudes asked me to be here because they're worried about you. Where's your label? Have you heard from your managers, your entourage. I don't see anyone here giving a fuck about you. That's right, it all comes out, you was jealous of that shit, - weren't you. - I'm jealous of what? Maybe the money, you know. Fame. Maybe the fact that I got millions of people follow me and who you got, huh? Who follows you? No one, you know why? 'Cause you a fucking nobody. Nobody gives a fuck about you and you will always be a fucking nobody. You're fucking delusional. Think I'm jealous of what, your fake ass fame? Your fucking money, man. Everyone is living in a mansion but you... you're living in this fucking condo that you don't even fucking own. Your whole fucking life is a fucking lie that you made up. So what the fuck am I jealous of? Just get the fuck out of here and go back to your trash ass fucking life, bro. What the fuck you know about my life? Ever since you became this fake ass Tito shit you never once asked me how I'm doing or what I'm dealing with. It's all about you, your likes and your followers man. Get over yourself. Oh. And I heard that album. That shit... that shit was officially trash. - Yo, what happened? - Man, fuck him. If you're always winning you never know how to deal with losing. - Hello? - Yo, what's up playboy? - You've gone ghost? - Nah man. It's just uh... It's just over, you know what I mean. - What's over? - My career. - I mean, everything. - Are you serious? You lost the battle, so what. Now we regroup and strategize on how to get this dude back. Now come on man, the album release party is tomorrow night. It was a Sunday night which is a really weird night to have an album release party, but the whole industry was going to be there. A violent stabbing at a Hollywood night club tonight. Rapper J-Escrow was stabbed during an altercation with rival rapper Lil Tito... J-Escrow had gone to the album release to troll, I guess and tease Lil Tito. There was an altercation between the two crews that led to the stabbing of J-Escrow. Your lawyer's here now. This is Oscar Gomez. He's gonna get you out of here, okay. All right. So I'm at the club, all right and um... you know, all of a sudden everybody's just shoving each other around and stuff and I was... Hey, hey, hey, you know what man. It's okay. Oscar, give us a moment? Sure thing. - What's up? - Yo, T, I didn't do this. I know. But what if you did? But I'll go to jail. This time I'll go to a real prison. Think about it, this could take your career to a whole new level. You know how much clout this will give you? I could be looking at attempted murder. No, no, no. No, you see... we plea self defense. You saw a gun, I'll have someone say they saw it too. I promise you you'll get a plea. Small slap on the wrist, two years at the most. Then you come out bigger than ever and this time... you own 90 percent of your album. Give you a minute to think that over. Be all right. You know, everything about that evening just seemed extremely strange. - Nothing added up. - It was a crazy weekend. No one thought that within 72 hours of J-Escrow releasing the expose video on Lil Tito that it would end with a stabbing. So the story is J-Escrow had a gun and was crashing the party. Further disrespecting Lil Tito but if you look at the facts and listen to the rumors, none of it makes sense. If J-Escrow was crashing the party, disrespecting Lil Tito, he would've been posting about it. It's trolling 101. You crashing the party of a rival artist, it'd be all over the Gram, Facebook, Twitter, whatever. Let's just do the math. So Friday, the expose video comes out. The internet explodes and calls Lil Tito a fraud. Saturday, the album drops and is received poorly. Sunday night, J-Escrow is stabbed. Lil Tito gets exactly what he wants. The expose video is shadowed by the stabbing and now all anyone is talking about is what happened at the club. I think, Lil Tito and his team invited J-Escrow to the club to set him up. ♪ I'm gonna be here forever ♪ ♪ Ah! ♪ Do I think Benito Cruz stabbed J-Escrow? No, I don't. It's a really lonely place at the top but it's worse when you hit rock bottom. Breaking news, we've just learned that an hour ago Benito Cruz, known to the rap community as Lil Tito signed a plea deal admitting guilt to the stabbing of rapper J-Escrow. I can't explain... what exactly happened that night. Especially when you're like in the moment and there's chaos and everything's going on. For me, everything about that incident was just a blur. Do you feel remorseful for your actions? Do I feel remorseful for what I've done? I mean, yeah. I'm not proud of my actions. I feel like, um, I let myself down. I feel like I let my family down. I feel like I let the fans down. I can truly say that I'm sorry for anyone that I've inflicted any type of pain to or hurt. I'm just glad that I've been blessed with this opportunity to make things right, you know what I mean. And... the judge has granted me a month so I can get my affairs in order. And in that time, I plan to record a new album and this time, I'm gonna focus on giving the people exactly what they want. And that's good music. ♪ You ain't making this easy ♪ ♪ Take back to my holy days ♪ ♪ Y'all don't want to see me ♪ ♪ Don't take me back, don't take me back ♪ ♪ Don't take me back, don't take me back ♪ - You like it? - I love it. It's a real album. You good? Man, you know... two years, man... it's going to go by quick. It's nothing. Look man, everything's already been taken care of. Protection's been paid for. You good. All you gotta worry about is how to spend all that money when you come home. All right? Come on man, keep your head up, bro. It's gonna be okay. Hey. I gotchu. Between all of the beef back and forth with the trolling and him feeling like, you know, he needed to step up in some way and show some sort of street credibility but the pressure. The pressure that even lead him to doing that in the first place is what's really crazy. When you build a platform that you live on everyday with millions of followers from all around the world watching and hanging on everything that you say, commenting on everything that you do. That kind of validation becomes a part of one's self-worth. Man, rappers go to jail all the fucking time. It's no big deal. It's like a part of doing business. How you holding up? I'm good. You know, try to keep busy. I do a lot of writing to pass the time. - That's good. - How's Fernando and Diaz? I haven't even seen them. I've been busy. - I have a baby girl. - Wait, what? - Yeah. - Are you serious? Yeah, beautiful baby girl. She's six weeks old. I can't wait to meet her, bro. When you get out of here just come through. Yeah, so sure, you know I mean... I mean, I got like a year and some change left and you know, time flies. - I feel you. - Yo, um, you heard my new album? What album? I dropped my second album. It's the one I recorded before I got in here. It came out last week. No, no I didn't even know you dropped an album but I've been busy with the baby and stuff so... Yeah, yeah, no it's all good, it's all good yeah. That's crazy. It's gotta be like a lot of long sleepless night, right. - Yeah. - Yeah, I always thought you were going to be the first one with a baby. Maybe, I don't know. Hey. Remember when you did that video and you told your dad you got your cousin pregnant? Hell yeah, man, that shit was hilarious. He beat both of our asses. - That was a good video. - Yeah. - That was my favorite one. - Wow. You um... you've been by the house? You've seen my mom? She's not doing too good. Yeah, you know when they told me I had a visitor I... - I thought maybe... - No, she's not coming. - My pop came through though. - Yeah. Yeah, he said this is good for me. Made me a man. We're rooting for you, bro. I know, I know. You know, when I get out of here, man thing's are going to be different. You know, what I mean. Your little baby girl, she's never gonna have to need or want for anything. I promise you that. Stay focused. He was on the internet everyday. Everyday pushing, grinding, hustling, showing up at parties, having other people post and like his shit, like everything. The bid and the whole hype about the bid was gonna create clout. Nobody gave a shit. Nobody cared because just as he went and did your bid for that there's 50 other young kids doing other shit even more ridiculous on the internet everyday. You have a collect call from Benito Cruz. Yo, what's up, I've been trying to reach you for the last two days. Sorry, pimping, it's been busy over here. Hey, um Zeus and his boys say they haven't received any deposits. Oh yeah. Your account dried up. Dried up? Whatcha mean dried up? - No more money. - But my album just came out - last week. - Yeah, it didn't do too well. But you said it was good. I thought it was good. But with nobody here to promote, no shows, no radio run there's no traction. Guess out of sight out of mind. Yo, you told me that I'd be taken care of plus you said that this would be bigger for my career then last time. Yeah, well shit don't always go as planned, big dog. Then you need to get me the fuck out of here, okay. I didn't have anything to do with this kid getting stabbed. - You know that. - Look, I gotta go. No, no, no, don't fucking hang up. - Everything gonna be all right. - Tony, don't fucking... You expect one thing because people told you, "Don't worry I got you, I'm gonna hold you down when you looked up, trust me, this my people in here, this is good. And you go in the spot like that and you have nobody or nothing. It changes the whole dynamic. So I'm really... it's sad but I'm not surprised at the outcome. Good morning, I'm meteorologist Maria Marple and temperatures early this morning starting of at 70 degrees... It's Monday. It's like around 9 Am. I remember waking up to a series of texts and notifications. This girl's on the other line. She's like "Hey, did you hear?" Uh... I was like damn. Fuck. Sorry guys.

The rapper, whose real name is Benito Cruz, passed away from four fatal puncture wounds. The rapper was known for his controversial videos and music. Benito Cruz plead guilty earlier this year to the club stabbing of rapper... You were one of the few people who had access and the ability to not only guide him. Do you feel that you could've stopped this from happening? No, I don't have any remorse in my heart. And I don't feel it was my job to guide him in the right direction. That was...

You know. Everyone used to say how special Benito was. His teachers said that he had the potential to be extraordinary. I wish that my son wasn't special. I wish that nobody knew who he was. I wish that he was a normal boy who grew up to be an ordinary man. Because then he would still be alive. I said... Benito, why do you do all these crazy things? And he said...
