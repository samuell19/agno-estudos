SOMEONE THOUGHT YOU WERE WORTH ENOUGH TO WEAR IT, HUH ? YES THEY DID. TO HAVE IT. I GUESS THEY WERE WRONG. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR YOU, JACKIE. MOVE AWAY, START AGAIN. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS. STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH. IN MY WILDEST DREAMS I NEVER IMAGINED THAT I COULD HAVE THIS. DAMN RIGHT. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE MONEY.

LET'S HOPE THIS CABERNET SAUVIGNON DOES AS WELL AS THE MERLOT DID LAST YEAR. OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL, I HAVE TO TELL DONALD. (Liddy) THIS ONE HAS A SLIGHT LICORICE UNDERTONE. WELL, TIME FOR THE TOAST. MAUREEN. THANK YOU, FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS, ENTHUSIASTS OF THIS FINE ELIXIR. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT YEAR FOR US. MAUREEN AND I HAVE LOST OUR SON.

Y'KNOW, YOU DESERVE ONE OF THOSE BIG ACTING AWARDS. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU WERE KNOCKED UP ? WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ? THAT'S MY BROTHER'S BABY YOU'RE CARRYING. THAT'S THE ONLY FAMILY I HAVE LEFT. GET OUT OF HERE, WE HAD A DEAL. Y'KNOW, THAT GIFT IMPROVED MY OUTLOOK ON LIFE. I GET THESE WORDS LIKE "EXPENSES" AND "OVERHEAD", YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ? THERE IS NOTHING LEFT, I GAVE YOU EVERYTHING I'VE GOT. (woman) HI, CATHERINE. I DON'T THINK SO. NO, THIS IS NEVER GONNA STOP. I AM FINISHED. I WANT MY BROTHER BACK AND HE'S GONE FOREVER. NOW YOU SHOULD BE ROTTING IN SOME PRISON SOMEWHERE, BUT NO, YOU'RE LIVING LIKE A DAMN PRINCESS. DONALD. HEY, THOSE WINES YOU SOLD ME, THEY WERE FINE, MAN. OH, SO GLAD YOU LIKE 'EM. I SEE YOU'VE MET CATHERINE. OH YEAH. (man) HEY, DONALD. HEY ! TOMORROW NIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT. THIS IS MY NUMBER IN CASE YOU LOST IT. AND I WANT THE JACKPOT TO BE BIG. VERY BIG. HEY, BLANCA, BEAUTIFUL PARTY. WHO'S THAT ? HE STOPPED ME AT THE MARKET ONCE. ASKED ME A WHOLE LOT OF QUESTIONS. WHAT ABOUT ? ABOUT THE WINERY, ABOUT HER. I DON'T KNOW, JED. JED, MY FRIEND HERE WANTS TO BUILD A BAR AND ENTERTAINMENT CENTER. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE ? SURE. THERE YOU GO, TOLD YOU JED'S GOOD. EVERYTHING'S BEEN PUT AWAY. ALL THE GUESTS ARE GONE. I GOT TIRED, SORRY. SO, WHO WAS THAT GUY ? WHO ? MAYBE I WANT TOO MUCH. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. MAYBE LIFE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE "HE SAID THIS" AND "SHE SAID THAT." MY PARENTS TALK ABOUT NOTHING EXCEPT RECIPES AND THE WEATHER. BUT WHEN WE MAKE LOVE... I CAN FEEL THAT YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. ARE YOU ? NO. THEN WHY WON'T YOU LET ME IN ? I WANT MORE THAN THAT. CATHERINE, GIVE ME A HAND WITH THAT CASE, WILL YOU ? BE CAREFUL WITH IT, IT'S MY NEW PETRUS, 1961. HAD IT BOUGHT AT AUCTION. FOOL THAT I AM, PAID 35,000 BUCKS FOR IT. WHAT ? I HAD NO IDEA. OH YEAH. SO, AH, HOW OLD IS THE OLDEST ? OH, I'VE GOT SOME NAPOLEONIC THING HERE, 18-SOMETHING. IF YOU THINK THE PETRUS WAS EXPENSIVE. A HUNDRED YEARS OLD ? YOU SEE THIS WINE ? WHEN THIS WAS BOTTLED, IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE INFERIOR. OH, THERE WAS A HEAT WAVE IN AUGUST. THE SKIN SHRIVELED ON THE VINE. THE SUGARS AND TANNINS CONCENTRATED. EVERYTHING SEEMED TO GO WRONG THAT YEAR. AND EVERYONE ASSUMED THAT THE WINE WOULD BE LEAN, Y'KNOW. THEN AFTER IT WAS CELLARED FOR A WHILE MATURITY BROUGHT TO IT SOMETHING THAT NO ONE EXPECTED. SO, NOW IS IT A GOOD WINE ? OH, NOT JUST A GOOD WINE, A VALUABLE ONE. YOU SEE, WINES ARE LIKE PEOPLE. THEY SHOULD BE JUDGED AFTER THEY'VE AGED A BIT, Y'KNOW. THAT'S WHEN A WINE, AND A PERSON'S, TRUE NATURE EMERGE.
