Boy: There is an old story about this Jewish guy walking through the streets of Hong Kong when he hears the sounds of davening. Now, he follows it into a small basement synagogue full of Chinese with tassels and tefillin praying in Hebrew. One old Oriental guy asks if he can help him. "No," the guy answers, "but I'm a Jew, and I was surprised to find Jews in Hong Kong." The Chinese guy looks at him. "You're Jewish? Funny, you don't look it." Now, you may be surprised to find Jews in my hometown of Beausejour, but like Rabbi Kaminsky said, where there's oxygen, there's Jews. And on this particular morning, those Jews were gathering at congregation Beth Israel. When my father had his bar mitzvah, they had to schlep all the way to Winnipeg. My grandfather Augustus Glick announced, "What this town needs is our own synagogue." And when my grandfather decides he wants something, - he gets it. - ( praying in Hebrew ) Boy: My whole family was up there with Rabbi Kaminsky, my parents and my bubbe and my zeta. That's me in the blanket-- Maximilian Glick. Well, actually, I was just baby boy Glick at this point. The name is coming. All: Amen. First he tastes his sudra, then he tastes his blanket. - Shh. - ( baby crying ) Such an inquisitive mind, a born scientist. Sarah, look at those hands. Am I right? A surgeon. Not a surgeon, a lawyer. Listen to him argue with the rabbi. If you ask me, maybe he'll grow up to be a fire engine. Well, he's got the right equipment for it-- a siren and a hose. Max: Why was I crying? Believe me, you'd be crying, too, if you knew what was coming. ( metal scrapes ) Max, don't touch yourself. Sarah, didn't I ask you to talk to him about that? Do you think that's your department? After all, you're the expert. Maxy, it's time to wake up. You don't want to be late for school. Maximilian, don't forget Rabbi Kaminsky at 4:00-- bar mitzvah lessons. And you've got to practice the piano, Maxella, before you go to school. And don't forget to sweep the store. Hasn't anybody around here heard of the concept of free will? Of course we have, darling. Don't forget to make your bed. Man: What do you mean expert? What's that supposed to mean? - Sarah: I was joking. - Augustus: What kind of joke is that for a little boy? Sarah: And don't put any of that grease on your head. Max: I always wondered if they had a two-way mirror in my room. Nah. ( traffic blaring ) Man: Pa, please don't take the sports section before I read it. I've asked you 100 times. Augustus: Even Einstein, he should rest in peace, can't read two pages at once. ( grunts ) Help, help, save me! I can't breathe! Is this the end? Will our poor 12-year-old suffocate in an alien prison camp where he's being smothered by evil space creatures masquerading as his family? But wait, it's Commander Maximilian Glick of the Royal Canadian Space Patrol swooping through the stratosphere on an intergalactic mission of-- Maxy, I'm gonna make you some oatmeal. Oh, no, Sarah. - Mercy. - I'm going to make some Sunny Boy. With all due respect, Mother Glick, what's wrong with oatmeal? Sarah dear, since when is a one-grain cereal - better than a seven? - Well, it's not better-- So it shouldn't be a total loss. We'll make a little of both, nu? Nu. Max: And you wonder why I can remember all the way back to my bris? Listen, a Jewish boy's life starts with them cutting off his tip. Then they spend the rest of his life trying to cut off the rest. ( school bell rings ) ( all chattering ) Boy, that Miss Williams is tough. What did she mean when she said those who fail to listen to history are doomed to repeat it? She meant that if you don't pay attention, she'll flunk you. - Oh. - But what about the new math teacher? - Isn't she something? - Gidoski? When she stood on that desk to show us that Ulysses triangle, - I thought I'd croak. - It's isosceles. You know, it's a triangle. Gee, Glick, is there anything you don't know? - Yeah, ease up, Max. - Sorry. Hey, there's that new girl from Winnipeg. - What's her name? Atchoski? - Jubrinski. No, Brzjinski. Yeah, Celia Brzjinski. What do you think, Max? Pretty cute, eh? - I don't know. - Well, I do. Hey, Celia! Max: Who had time for girls? I mean, with the piano competition com-- oh, did I tell you I played piano? When I was eight, I wanted a bike for my birthday. I got a piano. This was after the debate over which instrument fit which career. Lawyers need good lungs-- tuba. Surgeons need fast fingers-- violin. I'm still waiting for the bike. Do you know what I think, Master Glick? I think you've let yourself be spooked by the look of the piece. Heavens, five flats in a piece with one sharp. Looks as if Mr. Bach's cat ran across the manuscript. Unfortunately, it sounds that way as well. Um, sorry, Mr. Blackthorn. Should I start again? No. No. ( chuckles ) I think Mr. Bach's body has spun enough for one day. Shizuko? Will you join us for tea? Sure. Max: Did I tell you how much I hate to drink tea? Tea, Maxella? Max: Still, both with Mr. Blackthorn and Rabbi Kaminsky, it was something really special. You know, Maximilian, let me repeat the question. Abraham begat Isaac, Isaac begat Jacob who begat Joseph. Now, what did these great men have in common? Abraham worried about Isaac, Isaac worried about Jacob, who worried about Joseph. I can't remember who Joseph worried about. You know, I don't recall that answer in the Midrash. Oy, such a serious boy. What is it that worries you, Maximilian? Rabbi, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but why do I have to have a bar mitzvah? Because, Maximilian, when a Jewish boy reaches the age of 13, he becomes responsible for living by the Commandments. The bar mitzvah is a way of marking that date when you become a man. And you can start worrying about your own children. A bar mitzvah isn't gonna make me a man. Yes, it will, in God's eyes. Yeah, well, that's not who I'm worried about. I mean, sometimes I wonder if my parents stay up late at night worrying if I'm still gonna brush my teeth after they die. I'll let you in on a little secret, Max. If you quote me on this, I'll deny it. All parents drive their children crazy, especially Jewish parents. Why are they worse? Not a matter of worse, just different. Look, Maxella, we don't beget children. We build them. Comes from all those years of having nothing else to build. I don't want to be a building. - So what do you want? - How should I know? I'm just a kid. Nobody ever asked me. So maybe you should ask yourself. Well, one thing for sure, Rabbi-- I wanna be somebody. Well, Mr. Somebody, here's my advice-- don't worry so much. Just study for your bar mitzvah because a man can make his own decisions. And in the meantime, you'll go home and practice. Max: So I practiced and practiced. When the night of the competition came, I was terrified. What if I failed? What would my family do? I mean, I don't want to say they expect a lot from me, but in the Glick house, "A" stood for "adequate," "B" meant "barely decent," and "C" was "catastrophic." ( playing haltingly ) ( groaning ) ( giggles ) Nu, Peikes, what do you expect from a dentist's son? Pain. No, no, just wait, just wait. Just hang on. Just-- ( chimes ) That's fine, Bobby. Thank you. Very nice, Bobby. Come on, Manny, he tried. Yeah, getting him to practice is like pulling teeth. So? For a dentist, that should be easy. - He could use some drilling. - Candy? ( scattered applause ) Max: Well, Bobby Rosenberg wasn't a problem. My big worry was the new girl, Celia Brzjinski. Another one bites the dust. I wish I could get this over with and go home. I wish you were next. I'm so nervous, I don't think I could play the radio. - I am next. - All right, next, please. Number four? Max: Celia's father was Constable Brzjinski. Great, I lose, I'm nobody. I win, I go to jail. What a choice! Well, what do we have here, a duet? Perhaps it takes four hands after all. Um, but I'm number four, sir. They're so pushy, even the children. - It's okay, she can go first-- - No, I don't mind-- I think the only fair thing is to toss a coin. - Ladies first. - Heads. - Well? - Tails. Tails, I guess. Clever boy. - It's tails. - Tails, tails. Young lady, you may retire to enjoy your reprieve. H-Hold on. Okay, I won, right? - So I should get a choice-- - Sit. Uh, okay, sir. Play. ( music continues ) ( crowd murmuring ) ( applause ) ( cheering ) ( family chattering ) Here's to my little Rubinstein. Sarah: Congratulations! Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you? Augustus: I told you that LaCoste knew his music. Never have I heard such maturity and sensitivity. I guess he never heard a Glick before, eh, Henry? You've never played so well before, Maxy, but your tie was a little crooked. Henry: You know, I feel a little sorry for the Polish girl. Well, she only lost by two points. Grandmother: What's to be sorry? The girl was excellent. Maxy was more excellent. That's life. How's the cake? It's good. Well, he said the only difference was Max's pedal technique. The only difference between a Steinway and a shmegegge is one is a piano and the other ain't. ( laughter ) To tell you the truth, I was a little surprised they let him win. With all due respect, Mother Glick, it's not like that here. So, Sarah dear, where isn't it like that? Sarah: Maxy, what's the matter? You're not eating. - Are you sick? - No, I'm just tired. Oh, he does look flushed. Look, I'm just tired, really. Can I just be excused? Grandmother: Let me take his temperature. - But, Mom-- - With all due respect, Mother Glick, he says he's fine. Max, do you want me to take your temperature? No, seriously, can I just be excused? Grandmother: I'll heat a little soup. Really now, Sarah, please leave the boy alone. Max: It's all the excitement. I'm just tired. So, tateleh, soon you'll have your bar mitzvah. You'll be a man. 25 years I waited for this. Now, when your father had his bar-- All: The whole family had to schlep to Winnipeg. Pop, we've all heard the story. So when does it hurt to hear family tradition? Maxy, come here. Speaking of family tradition... It's beautiful. It's the same one I wore. And you looked beautiful, too, Henry. Ah, thanks, Ma. Would you look at you? What a day this has been. All right, you men, it's time for Max to go to bed. - He's had a big day. - I'll say. - Good night. - Good night, my champion. - Good night, Ma. - Maybe I should take his temperature. - Oh, Ma! - Bubbe, not again, please. All right, all right. I guess a big man like you doesn't want an old yenta poking around his tushy. Good night. Max: I guess I still had a way to go with this manhood thing. I mean, Jewish parents never let their kids grow up. That's why they call us the children of Israel. 25 years. - ( wind chime tinkling ) - ( piano music playing ) Shh. Yes, that's it. That's very nice. Master Glick. Come in, won't you? I-- I thought it's 4:00, isn't it? Yes, of course it is. Are we forgetting our manners? No. I, um-- hello. Hi. Evidently, the Brzjinskis blamed Celia's pedaling on the size of her former teacher's feet. So they've decided that there is absolutely no point in continuing to drive her to Winnipeg. Ah, here it is. Come over here, Max. Sit down. Sit closer. You will never reach the keys. You know, I used to play this four-hand arrangement with my uncle Basil. He went on to be Sir Basil. I just went on. ( chuckles softly ) Are we ready? One and two and three and one and two and... ( piano music playing ) Enough. I've made up my mind. You two will compete in the provincials in the Four Hands Open category. You mean together? Well, unless you have another pair of hands hidden away somewhere, yes. But what about the scholarship? I can't afford the conservatory without it. Celia, there are two scholarships in the Four Hands category. And are you sure you'd win the singles? - Max? - I don't know. I mean, all that extra practice, and my French project is due. It's okay with me, Mr. Blackthorn. That is, unless you're scared you can't keep up with me. I take it we have an arrangement. Let's pick it up at the beginning of the trio. - ( organ music playing ) - Celia: Hey, they fixed the organ. - Do you want to go and listen? - In the church? - Yeah. - No, thanks. Oh, okay. So what's it like, you know, being Jewish and everything? Well, first, you gotta have a terrific memory. Like you can't have a piece of gum without remembering somebody starving somewhere. Gum? Well, is it true that all Jewish kids are born musical? That's ridiculous. Who told you that? My mother. She said you had an unfair advantage at the competition because, well, you know, you're Jewish. Oh, yeah? What about Bobby Rosenberg? If he was born musical, he sure forgot it pretty quick. Is he Jewish? Is the Pope-- yeah, he is. You ever wish you were someone else? I used to want to be like Sandy. Why Sandy? Well, because all Ukrainians are naturally strong. Now that's ridiculous. No, it's not. My grandfather told me. Oh, I see. So how come it's ridiculous to say that all Jews are born musical and it's not ridiculous to say that all Ukrainians are strong? - Because they-- because it's-- - Yes? Well? Speak up. You're right. It's ridiculous. Guess we're even. Not quite. You're still two points ahead of me. Bye. ♪ ( man screams in film ) ( no audio ) So we win the competition, split the scholarship, and go on to become famous as Brzjinski and Glick. Um, but I thought we agreed to Glick and Brzjinski. Well, whatever. We'll be more famous than Ferrante and Teicher. Maybe we should change our names. Maximilian Brzjinski and Celia Glick? No. Celia Jones? Tom? Dick Glick, now that's it. Maybe we should just stick with what we got. Yeah, I guess so. So, um... you know that show "Talent Time"? Yeah, we watch it all the time. When I was six, I won it. I had it all planned. I was going to be a famous pianist. The provincials, the conservatory, New York, Juilliard, and Carnegie Hall. I was so mad when you beat me. Some nobody from the sticks ruining everything. But I'm happy we're gonna be famous together. If we become famous-- - If? - When we become famous-- Sarah: Maxy, what are you doing sitting in the dark? So, are you going to introduce me to your little friend? - Mmm. - Pass the salt, please. The soup was as good as always. Mm. Wow, that's good. Eat, Max. Children in China are starving. Name three. All right, young man, that's enough. Now this attitude is out of line. What is the big deal? All we said was-- You said don't see her. What am I supposed to do, close my eyes? We go to the same school. We practice piano together. Maxella, you're better than she is. She's just trying to use you to get ahead. I think you should play alone. Augustus: But with another teacher. I warned you, Bryna. What could you expect from those kind of people? Max: Which kind of people? Henry: Never mind, Max. Look, we'll talk about this later. No, we'll talk about it right now. I didn't build a synagogue for him to marry a shiksa in it. Bryna: Nobody's getting married. Not yet, but with this four-handed thing? It takes only two to play piano. How do you know what the other two hands are doing? - Papa! - Augustus. Sarah: Look, could we please just drop the whole thing? Max: It's all because she isn't Jewish, isn't it? I can't believe you're so prejudiced. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, look, prejudice is a negative thing. Now, this is a positive thing because it preserves our heritage. Intermarriage dilutes our traditions. Absolutely. So you're saying marrying a gentile is like adding water to the Jews? Rabbi Kaminsky wouldn't be saying any of this stuff. He should have had kids. I wish he was my father, not you. - It's time that he knew. - Bryna: Not tonight, Sarah. Max: What? What is it? What? Well, uh... Max... Rabbi Kaminsky had a daughter-- Rita. So where is she? And why did you say "had?" What happened to her? Well, she, uh, got married. Max: So? What's wrong with that? Sarah, for God's sake, help me out here. Maxy, Rita Kaminsky married a boy who wasn't Jewish. So? So, naturally, her parents were upset. Yeah? So upset that they went into mourning for her as if she was dead. - They sat shiva. - Shiva? - Remember when uncle Lenny died? - Yeah. And they draped the mirrors and everything? Well, they did that. And they've not spoken to her since. Max: What a shock. See, Rabbi Kaminsky taught me that one thing that made man different from animals was that people committed sins. The other thing was that people forgive them. I guess he forgot to tell me the third, that people don't always practice what they preach. I say "I guess" because I never got the chance to ask. ( woman crying ) Maxella. ( speaks Yiddish ) Didn't they tell you? There'll be no lesson today. What happened? Did Rita Kaminsky get married again? Come on. We'll be home soon, Maxella. Max: Rabbi Kaminsky had been hit by a hay truck while crossing against a red light. Now I had no answers, only questions. And the first question was whether I wanted to be Jewish anymore. ( wolf howls ) Max: One thing for sure-- my bar mitzvah lessons were over for a while, which left me a lot of time to practice the four-handed piece. Of course, I didn't exactly tell my parents about Celia. In fact, I didn't say anything to anyone. I was just kind of waiting for the right moment. I did, however, learn an important lesson in the concept of Jewish inevitability. Just when it looked like nothing can get worse, it got worse. - Thank you, Bryna. - Thank you, Bryna. Quick, we're late already. The car's downstairs. He couldn't come on a regular bus like a regular person? And on a Sunday? I thought you were the one who was in such a hurry so that your prodigy could keep studying for his bar mitzvah. And I still say what kind of congregation hires a rabbi without an interview? A fortunate one. What, you think rabbis grow on trees, just pick one when they're ripe? I made it clear to them-- if we're not satisfied, we get somebody else. After Max's bar mitzvah. Sure, after the bar mitzvah. What is this, a money-back guarantee? A free trial? ( sighs ) Moskover... with you, everything is a trial. ( man muttering prayers ) Sir? Excuse me, sir? Hello? All right, fella, you wanna tell me what you're doing? Hey, I'm talking to you. And I'm talking to you, so maybe he could wait his turn? I don't know where you're from, but around here, we have some respect for the law. Where are you from, anyway, the moon? Chi... ca... go. What? Chi-ca-go. What's that, a reservation? Chi-ca-go. Chi-ca-go. ♪ That toddlin' town... ♪ All right, okay, maybe you oughta come with me. Now, just a minute, I have to put these things away. Come on, sir, I think it's time we go. - What, right now? I haven't got time-- - Please, just take your coat-- Fine, I'll take the coat. You take the bag. - Be careful with everything. - Okay, okay. Tell you the truth, Mr. Peikes, I don't believe he's a rabbi. I think he's some kind of beatnik. I mean, no offense, but I think I can tell what a Jewish person looks like, and he doesn't look like anything I've ever seen. Well, there is. Shalom aleikhem. All: Aleikhem shalom. You must be the welcoming committee. Oy. Aleikhem shal-- - Much better. - Maxella, here's your milk. ( chattering ) I can't imagine where he is. - Oh, there he is. - So what took you so long? You had to pick him up in heaven? - So, Pop, what's he like? - Is the wife nice? - There's no wife. - No wife? He's a widower. Oh, well, then we can invite him for dinner - with Rose's daughter. - ( all chattering ) What's the matter? Maximilian, go to your room. I'm eating. ( speaks Yiddish ) Go. Okay, I'm going. I'm going. Oh. I'm going. God. So what's this? - ( door closes ) - ( speaking Yiddish ) ( all speaking Yiddish ) Max: You can probably guess that they're talking about Rabbi Teitelman. They're saying that to send such an Orthodox Jew, a lubavitcher rabbi no less, to a little town like ours must have been a clerical error because in our town, invisibility was a virtue, and he was anything but invisible. Funny-looking guy. Max: And Yiddish wasn't the only private language flying around. In fact, it was like a Berlitz boom. ( overlapping conversations in different languages ) ( dog barking ) ( knock on door ) Um... ( knock on door ) Yeah, a-all right. ( knock on door ) Ah, the scholar. Come in. Come in. - ( kettle whistling ) - I'm just making some tea. Not much here to inspire a young man, huh? That's for sure. I beg your pardon? I said, "That's four sugars." In the tea. Our Scripture bids us walk humbly with our God. I like to go a little step further. I also like to sit humbly with Him. I sleep even more humbly. Oh, you said four sugars, I believe. Perfect. Good. Mr. Glick-- oh, uh... Rabbi Teitelman. Glick. You know, you're my first bar mitzvah and my first congregation? I think we're going to be very good friends. So tell me a little about yourself. There's... nothing to tell. Mm, I'm sure-- I'm sure there's something, hmm? Well, I play piano. I won the Grady piano competition. I'm first in my class at school. - I-- - Mr. Glick, this is your idea of humility? Well, you asked. You know, I think we should review your progress to date. Rabbi Kaminsky always reviewed at the end. ( sighs ) Yes, but I'm not Rabbi Kaminsky, am I? That's for sure. I think you already had four sugars. Hmm? Now, the correct Torah portion... for your bar mitzvah is... The Book of Numbers. Which is not exactly the biblical telephone directory. Now, if memory serves me right, that portion describes the census of Israelite males over the age of 20. From the tribe of Reuben is 46,500. From the tribe of Gad is 74,600. From Zebulon is 57,400. From-- or is it 54,700? It's 54,700. ( mutters in Hebrew ) I was right the first time. It's 57,400. The elephant never forgets. From the tribe of-- But I thought elephants are supposed to walk humbly with their God, too. You're absolutely right, Mr. Glick. Perfection is the domain of the master of the universe, blessed be He. As for you and I, I guess we both need a little bit more practice. Well, I think that's enough for one day. Went rather well for the first time, though, don't you think? Yep. Can't wait till next week. Wait a minute, I'll walk with you. So, Max, what was the name of the Rabbi who taught you before me? - Kaminsky. - Kaminsky. ( speaks Hebrew ) Kaminsky, yes, and he explained to you all about what "bar mitzvah" means? Yes-- uh, no. - No? Yes or no? - No. Well, it's very simple. "Bar" is simple. It means "son of." "Mitzvah" is a little bit more difficult. It could mean "blessing." It could mean "commandment." - ( phone ringing ) - It could mean "good deed." Rabbi Levi Yitzchok would say that a mitzvah is to bind, because doing a mitzvah binds us to the Creator. What do you think, hmm? I think, um, I remember I have to go get a loaf of bread. And do you know what Rabbi Levi Yitzchok - would say to that? - What? He would say that the bakery is right over there. So we should go to the bakery. I'll wait for you. You can get a loaf of bread. I'll wait, all right? Okay, so, um, if you become a man at the age of 13, then how come they don't count you in the census until you're 20? Aha! You know, Mr. Glick, you have quite a brain there. You're very lucky. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. "Glick" is the Yiddish word for "luck." Do you know what the word for "bad luck" is? Max: I knew. It was Teitelman. ( piano music playing ) F-sharp, Master Glick. F-sharp. That's very nice, Miss Brzjinski. Tempo, Master Glick. Tempo. G-natural. G-natural. F-sharp! ( hums notes ) Like that! Well, at least two of the hands here appear to know the piece. Thank you for your patience, Miss Brzjinski. That'll do for today. Shall I make the tea, Derek? No, I think we'll skip that for today. I suggest that you two spend a lot more time together before the next lesson. Max won't practice with me. He canceled. Master Glick? It's 'cause of this new rabbi. I've got a lot of bar mitzvah work to catch up on. Well, you'll just have to decide where your priorities lie. There'll be no competition if you keep on missing practices. I'll speak to your parents. No, no, no. I'll speak to them. They do realize that you're entered, don't they? Y-yeah, sure. - Gonna walk past the bakery? - No, I can't. I have to catch up on some work and my dad-- Fine, if you don't want to walk me home, just say so. Master Glick, what is going on? You two used to be as thick as thieves. - ( door closes ) - Nothing. Mr. Blackthorn, did your parents have a wake when you got married to Mrs. Blackthorn? Oh. Shizuko, my sweet, I think we will have some tea after all. My uncle Basil had a nephew he wouldn't speak to for 11 years because they disagreed over the definition of "allegro con molto." Don't let other people's limitations become your limitations. Open yourself up to life, Maximilian. That's the only way to find out who you are. Max: And if Celia and my family weren't enough problems, Christmas was coming. I mean, Christmas was always the hardest time of the year for me. It was like everyone was at this big party and I had a gigantic neon sign over my head flashing "not invited." There she is. Go and talk with her. - But she's with Sandy. I don't think-- - Go on, you goon. No, it's really great. One of the perogies has a nickel inside it, and whoever finds it gets to open a present. So how about it? Well, we're doing our tree tonight, so... Yeah, well, maybe some other time. Merry Christmas, Glick-o. Hey, Sarge! Hi, Celia. Bye, Celia. Listen, Maximilian Glick, have I got some rare tropical disease that I don't know about? - No. - Well, then how come you never talk to me anymore? 'Cause, um, I thought you wanted to talk to him. Sandy? No, he just wants me to help him do his tree. Why? Oh, the Christmas tree! - Yeah, that's lots of fun. - Yeah, it's the greatest. Hey, my parents say I can invite someone over. Yeah? That's good. You're lucky. - That's amazing. - Yeah, but what about your parents? My parents? Um, they're great, yeah. Um, they always say never let other people's limitations become your limitations. I'd love to come over, sure. - Great. So after supper, okay? - Okay. Okay, bye. Great. Max: I'm fine, really. I'm just tired. Tired is one thing, but not eating is another. I thought you liked Hong Ling's. I just need a nap. Henry: Aw, come on. If were late, they'll be out of lobster Cantonese. How's he feeling? He is right here. He's not dead. He is just tired. Augustus: Maxella, even Moses's mother worried about him. Moses's mother? I bet she made him wear galoshes when they crossed the Red Sea, huh? Good night, Maxella. ( Bryna chattering ) Henry: Where is she? - ( chatter ) - ( door opens, closes ) Whoa! ( groans ) ( "Jingle Bell Rock" playing ) Man: ♪ Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock ♪ ♪ Jingle bells swing and jingle bells sing ♪ ♪ Blowing and snowing up bushels of fun ♪ ♪ Now the jingle hop has begun ♪ - ♪ Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock... ♪ - ( knocks ) Celia: Thanks for coming. I thought you hated me or something. No, I could never hate you. I just-- Isn't that beautiful? Herman, isn't that beautiful? - Beautiful. - Max, have you got your tree up already? - No. - No? Max doesn't celebrate Christmas, Mother. - He's Jewish. - Oh, I knew that. They don't go to Mass or anything, but everybody has a tree and presents. - Don't they? - No, ma'am. Well, you have a "chanoocha" bush, then. It's all the same difference. No, ma'am. You see, Hanukkah is very different. Of course it is. I knew that. - Can we light it up now, Mommy? - Yes, I think it's time. Herman, you do the honors while I get the top. - It's my turn to put it on! - No, let our guest do it. Aw, Mom. Lights. Isn't it beautiful? This is my favorite time of year. Max, here, you can put this right on top. There you go. Put it on. Come on, put it on. Right on top, dear. Be careful, young fella, it's fragile. ( distorted ) Be careful, young fella, it's fragile. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's-- ( distorted voices overlapping ) Max! ( door opens ) Your friend is, uh, kind of strange. Maybe it was the eggnog. ( panting ) Max? I thought it was you. What are you doing? Nothing. Yes, that's exactly what it looks like. You know, I just saw your parents doing nothing over at the Chinese restaurant. If I didn't know any better, I would've thought that they were hiding behind their menus. As if the master of the universe really cared whether they chose one from column A or from column B. You didn't eat with them? Um, I was sick. Oh, well, then you should get in out of the cold. Can't be very good for your sickness, right? - Yeah. - ( chuckles ) Teitelman: So I can't complain about your level of scholarship, but there is something missing. I mean, there is no spark. There's no love. You know what it is? It's empty. Maybe it all meant something 5,000 years ago, but it's not gonna do me any good, is it? Wait a minute. We're doing a mitzvah. That's its own reward. If it's gonna do somebody some good, it's gonna be for the one who receives it, do you understand? Well, then that's great. I'm only doing it because of my family. Can I go home now? Why? Because you're sick? Don't look at me like that. Crazy I am. Stupid I am not. And neither, I can tell you right now, is the master of the universe. Rabbi? If I were to, you know, say, do something bad, to, say for instance, decorate a Christmas tree, for example, would I go to hell? Um... no. On the other hand, maybe I should check with Santa. ( both laugh ) But I don't get it. I mean, everybody's so nice, so sweet to each other, but underneath, it's all so-- so mean. Like, um, do you know about Rita Kaminsky? Uh, yes, I do. Well, why does God want us to be that way? ( sighs ) I don't think He does. I think that's why he made only one man and one woman, so that nobody could say that, "My parents are better than your parents." But they do. Everybody does. You know something? I've still got to write my sermon, you know, - for Brotherhood Day. - What a joke that is. What, my sermon? Oh, you mean Brotherhood Day. Yeah. Well, I was thinking maybe you could help me with the sermon. - I could? - Yes. But you wouldn't talk about any of this stuff. You never know. I mean, you have a unique perspective on this town. I'm just a stranger here. What do I know? But you, you could gather information for me, act as my research assistant. Okay. Okay, Rabbi. So you want to know about Beausejour? Do you have any paper? Lots of paper? Master of the universe, I think we might be onto something. All right, there was, like, this one time when my mother was running for president of the PTA against Mrs. Kelly. Henry: I can't believe you were late again. Sarah: Am I the one who decided to clean out the closet? Henry: I was killing time. Look, there's a spot. - Sarah: It says "no parking." - Bryna: It means no parking except for Brotherhood Day. - Henry: Should I park? - Sarah: Sure, go ahead, get a ticket. Maybe there's a closet in the jail that needs cleaning. Henry: You think the car is all right? Sarah: Oh, it's fine, just fine. Man: In Christ's holy name, amen. You may be seated. Well, thank you, Father Lacroix and Reverend Archer for that evocative and thought-provoking invocation. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to call on the leader of our Jewish-- um, Hebraic community Rabbi Teitelman to offer the sermon on this, Beausejour's third annual Brotherhood Day. ( applause ) Couldn't wear a normal suit for this? Father Lacroix, Reverend Archer. - Citizens of Beausejour. - ( woman coughing ) - What is this, a sermon or a census? - It's a very great honor to me to be here on this very special day. Though I really have to confess that with Father Lacroix, Reverend Archer, and myself, what you are getting is at best a mixed blessing. ( laughter ) But so is brotherhood a mixed blessing. You know, there's only one problem with living together. - That's living together. - ( laughter ) You know what the Creator said when Moses told Him that Israel had problems? "Listen, take two tablets, call me in the morning." ( laughter ) ( laughs ) Oy vey. Now, Cohen got a telegram from his son. "Papa, I'm going to Jerusalem. I'm going to become a Christian." Oy vey. He didn't know what to do. He ran to Greenberg. He told them the whole story. Greenberg said, "It's funny you should mention. I got a telephone call from my son. He said he's going to Jerusalem. He's gonna become a Christian." What to do? They went to run to the rabbi. They told him the whole sad story. The rabbi said, "Funny you should mention. My son's going to Jerusalem. He's going to become a Christian, and I'm a rabbi. You can imagine how ashamed I am. What should we do? We have to pray to the Creator. We have to rend our clothes. We have to put ashes on our head, fast for two days." Two days later... the gates of heaven opened. The voice of the Creator came down and said, "My children, what can I do for you?" And each man told him that his son was going to Jerusalem to become a Christian. And then the voice of the Creator boomed out, "It's funny you should mention." ( laughter ) All right, all right, all right. Brotherhood. Brotherhood. You know, I heard an amusing story. It seems that a certain parent-teacher's association had an election. A daughter of Israel was running against a daughter of Ireland. The votes were 35 to five. The five Jewish mothers voting as a block, as did the non-Jewish mothers. The victorious Irishwoman was heard to say, "Boy, those Jews stick together." - ( people murmuring ) - Teitelman: Now, this is funny. But it is not brotherhood. You hired him. It's not brotherhood when we have a town where we have to hold our interfaith service in a community hall because no one wants to sit in somebody else's pew. ( whispers ) I think I'm losing votes. How did he know that? Teitelman: My friends, at the back of this community hall, there is such a marvelous banquet. I think I have to go now. Teitelman: It's wonderful. It's a smorgasbord of delights. It's also the result of a lot of very hard work. Now, are you only gonna eat the ravioli because that's what your mother made? - Don't pay any attention... - Because I'll tell you, the Creator doesn't want you to only eat the ravioli. - He wants you to eat perogies. - It's good. - Be not afraid. You can taste them all. - Who does he think he is? After all, ravioli... Oh, this is a disaster. ...kreplach, wontons, they're all little pieces of dough with fillings. And each one has its own special filling, and each is delicious. Although maybe there's a pinch too much salt in the kreblach. - Too much salt? - But I digress. He should only digress himself all the way the hell back to Chicago. Go and enjoy yourselves, enjoy the feast, and most important, enjoy each other. ( clock ticking ) You're obviously not interested in talking about the menu for oneg shabbat. Moskover: A wise man. So where was all this wisdom when we needed-- Moskover, please, parliamentary procedure. I'm still president of the board. But not for long. Now, then, Rabbi... do you think this little cooking lesson the other day made life any easier for us Jews? Since when has life been easy for the Jews? Peikes: Rabbi, I know you mean well. Do you think our people are gonna be satisfied with such an answer? Since when have our people been satisfied with answers? - I ask a question. I get a question. - Peikes, Peikes. Rabbi, you don't understand what life is like in a small town. Now, Rabbi Kaminsky, may he rest in peace, aleha ha-shalom, he understood that there are certain realities of life here. Well, I wasn't fortunate enough to know Rabbi Kaminsky, but he's resting in peace, aleha ha-shalom, because he obviously didn't understand every reality. The rules of traffic, for example. ( snickers ) There's the smart answer again. Listen, Rabbi, my problem with you is that you don't seem to have the sense of the fakeness of the occasion. Now, Pop, there's a lot of truth in what he says. Augustus: Henry, there was a lot of garbage in what he said and the way he said it. Where are the jokes in the Talmud? Where are the jokes in Torah? Mr. Glick, he who is only concerned with studying Torah, not concerned with works of love and with mercy is like one who has no God. Rabbi... don't swallow poison just because you know the antidote. Hmm? ( wind howling ) Max: You were great the other day, just great. Teitelman: Really? I loved the stuff about the ravioli. ( laughs ) The ravioli was... good, but I don't know what got into me. I'm a stranger here, you know? What you said we have to do the mitzvah without even thinking about the consequences. And that's what you did. You really think that my speech was a mitzvah? Oh, yeah, it was a mitzvah. Can I just ask you one question? Huh? What did get into you? I don't know. I suppose it's the same thing that got into me when... I was about your age, you know? I was-- see, I was-- I was in cheder, I was in school, and the rebbe was talking to the whole class about Moses, and that "two tablets" joke, it just jumped right into my head, and from my head, it jumped right into my mouth, and I was cleaning blackboards for a month. But I always figured a good laugh was worth it. That was the first of many times. But you said that lubavitchers believed in joy. - Oh, they do. They do believe in joy. - Why'd you get in trouble? Well, because I guess lubavitchers' sense of humor has changed over the years. I don't know, who knows? Anyway, from then on, I was just another rabbi who wanted to become a standup comedian. - Come on. - No, really, really. I dreamed about sneaking out to perform, but Calman Teitelman? So I had a stage name-- Cal Title. - Cal Title. - Yeah, or-- or Kelly Title. And then what happened? ( sighs ) Come on, let's have a cup of tea. Well, you have to understand, Max, I come from a whole house full of rabbis, you know? So what happened? I'm a rabbi in Beausejour pouring out my confessions to a 12-year-old piano player. Rabbi? Mm-hmm. If I told you a secret... Would I promise not to tell? There's this girl... Teitelman: So let me understand this. You're... lying to everybody? Yeah? What do you want from me? Your advice. Well, I think it's really very simple. You just have to start by telling the truth, and you have to start by telling your family. But they'll go nuts. Maybe, but I think there has to be somebody you can talk-- what about your father? My family is like a bunch of wire hangers in a closet. You reach out for one... and you get an armload all tangled up. I don't know what to do. Well, I think you should take a chance with the truth. The truth is always worth it. Maybe I could talk to them for you. Would that help? No, that wouldn't help. - Would it? - No. No. I'll talk to them. I promise. Max, don't promise me. You should promise yourself. Hmm? - Rabbi? - Mm-hmm. Um, I have to walk past the bakery on the way home again. Feel like getting any fresh air? Well, now that you mention it, sounds like a very good idea, a very good idea. Okay, let's go. Do you, you know, still think about being a comedian? Or are you always gonna be a rabbi? Max, who knows what the future holds, huh? ♪ Max: I was going to tell them, I really was, but everything seemed to be going okay, and, well, I didn't tell them. Then one day, we found out what the future did hold. ( tire pops ) Damn! Oh, no. Well, that's that. We're going to need a whole new wheel, maybe even an axle. I'm afraid you'll have to miss the concert. But it's Ferrante and Teicher. We could take the bus. I'm afraid I've got to stay here and take care of this. I'm sorry. Unless you can find someone else to take you. But there isn't anybody. Couldn't we just go alone? To Winnipeg? No, that's out of the question. But I used to live in Winnipeg. It's easy. - You just take the number five bus-- - Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, you kids had better head on home. Can you see Steve Foster, tell him to bring his tow truck? - Sure. - I'll wait here. - Okay, bye. - Bye. It's so unfair. I've been saving up for weeks just to hear them play. Yeah, I know, and it was so perfect, too. My parents are at Auntie Ada's until 5:00. Yeah, I told mine I was going. I just didn't say anything about you. They think you're kind of strange. Really? ( laughs ) Yeah. Well, um, wanna go get a doughnut? No, not really. Well, what do you want to get? I want to get the bus to Winnipeg. - So let's go! - ( squeals ) All right! - Whoa! - ( squeals ) ♪ Man: Here is the CBC national news read by Earl Cameron... ( phone rings ) Hello, yes? Mr. Blackthorn, how's every little-- Huh? They went where? Uh-huh. By themselves. So? Well, at least they telephoned. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who is Ferrari and Teichman? ( piano music playing faintly ) Calman? Calman Teitelman! Reuben Calish! Is that you? Who else would I be? ( both greeting in Hebrew ) - What are you doing here? - What am I doing here? I live in Winnipeg now. And you, I thought you had a congregation. - Yes. - It's going well? - It's going. - Listen, I don't live too far from here. - You'll come for tea. - Well, I'm waiting for some friends, actually. So what, these friends of yours, they don't drink tea? Max, Celia, isn't this an incredible coincidence? I want to introduce you to my friend Reuben Calish. Now we're all gonna go and have some tea. I'm singing with a klezmer band now. Listen, I want you to meet them. I'll call them over. We'll make some music. We'll sing, dance, have a little fun. ( group singing folk music ) Calish! Teitelman! Hey! ( song ends, laughter ) I've never heard music like this before. - No? - What do the words mean? What do the words mean? ( speaks in Yiddish ) Calish? Zingen bisl. ( sings in Yiddish ) ♪ We have a little melody ♪ ♪ With... blessing and with life ♪ ♪ We sang this song together ♪ ♪ The whole family ♪ ♪ The uncles and the aunts, the mothers and the fathers ♪ ♪ The bubbe mit de zeta ♪ The grandmother and the grandfather. ( sings in Yiddish ) ♪ When they were still children ♪ ♪ Long ago ♪ ( all singing, music resumes ) ( music stops, laughter ) Hey, Calman, you should join up with us. We could use a badchen. What's a badchen? It's like a storyteller or a master of ceremonies. It's not a bad idea, Calman. Calish, thank you very much, no. I've been hired to cater next year's Brotherhood Day. I have to make lots of perogies for them. You're so funny. Are all rabbis like you? Ah, that, my dear, is the 64,000 shekel question. Calish: And now, live from high atop - the beautiful Yeshiva Hilton... - Oh, no. It's time for the rollicking Rabbi, - Kelly Title! - ( fanfare plays ) - Come on. - Oh, no. ( laughs ) - ( scattered applause ) - Thank you very much. All right, Kelly Title is very happy to be back. Now we have a marvelous show for you tonight. So I'm gonna get right to my first guest who is the amazing, the incomparable, Maximilian Glick! Whoo! ( fanfare plays ) Um, luckily there's no piano here, so I'll just sit down. Sure, there is. Stall, Max. Stall. Okay. I, um, once went into a doctor's office, and I said, "Doctor, what should I do? I've lost my memory." Doctor says, "Pay in advance." ( laughter ) It just popped into my head. Uh-huh. ( laughs ) Ah ha! The piano! Max! Or can you only play a grand piano? I can play any old piano. All right, maestro, play! And I'll need my partner for this. - Partner. - But I don't know anything Jewish. Just play anything in a minor key. It sounds Jewish. Mozart's Turkish Rondo? ♪ ( song ends ) ( all singing ) ( singing stops ) - Do you realize how worried we were? - Dad! Let's not overreact. Henry: So today he wants to play piano. Maybe tomorrow he'll want to be Hank Greenberg. Sarah: Henry, the rabbi said he already has plans to go to New York. This is not bubblegum cards. That's not really the issue, is it? You mean the girl. It's puppy love. Puppies don't grow up? Teitelman: If you're gonna keep Max from playing the piano because the girl isn't Jewish, I mean, really, that's just nuts. Is this a quote from the Talmud or your own words? "Just nuts." Sarah: What bothers me is all the secrecy. You see, I had to find out from the Brzjinskis that my own son was in a competition. How do you think that makes a mother feel? I-I'm sorry, that's my fault. Augustus: The whole thing is your fault, if you ask me. I think you're forgetting that I'm the one who went there. I'm the one who brought them back here. I don't believe for a second. Ever since you arrived, it's tsuris and more tsuris. Trying to tell everyone that they are not good enough. No, Mr. Buttinski, I warned you before, if you want to mess with the swing vote on the board, it's all right with me. But butt out of our family. Excuse me, I'm sorry. Max: And that was that. Ferrante and Teicher had nothing to worry about. The piano team of Brzjinski and Glick had played its final coda. ( door closes ) Jeez, Max, I heard. You okay? Hey, Sarge, you know the only difference between El Glick-o and the electric company is that they're only grounded - for 100 years. - Why don't you just shut up? Celia! What happened with your parents? I don't want to talk about it. What are you so mad at me for? Do you really want to know? Okay, I think, Maximilian Glick, that you're the most selfish person on the face of the earth. You had no right to mess up my dreams. Did you just think you could go to the provincials and never tell them? It's so unfair. Now I have to practice for the singles, and I'm three months behind everyone else. I hate you, and I never want to see you again. ( school bell rings ) ♪ Well, then you're going to cancel your bar mitzvah, that's not gonna hurt me. - I don't care! - That's gonna hurt you, - and it's gonna hurt your whole family. - That's good. It's really good. Just call it a withdrawal of services. It just jumped into my head. You know, if you spit upwards, it's gonna end up right back in your own face. I never told anybody any of your deep dark secrets. Why'd you have to tell them about New York? - Because-- - They didn't have to know any of that stuff. I thought that more lies, Max, wasn't gonna do anybody any good at all. It was my problem, not yours. It was mine. I could've handled it my own way. What way-- what way was that? Huh? What way? You know what the Commandment says? ( speaks Hebrew ) "Honor thy mother and thy father." Well, what if thy mother and thy father are wrong? Well, people are wrong. They make mistakes. We're human. I made a mistake. I was wrong. I should have told them before. You are never wrong? I was wrong about you. You don't think maybe you could be just a little bit divine and make a small compromise now and have the whole rest of your life to do whatever you wanted to do? You see... I-I never wanted a piano in the first place. I wanted a bike. A blue bike. Max... I think that the piano is your way out. My way out? I'm not getting out of here. I'm gonna live here forever in Beausejour. I'm gonna inherit the store, and the sign is gonna read "A. Glick and Son and Son and Son." All right, all right, all right, all right. If you have dreams like yours, you cannot put them in a drawer behind some old socks. Dreams. You-- you, for one, are no expert on dreams. I mean, look at what you did with your dreams. Nothing. You did nothing. ( door closes ) ( all chattering ) - I got the Rabbi on the phone. - What did he say? Does he know where he is? Maxy, come here!

Maxy, is something wrong? Where are my glasses? It doesn't matter. It says "on strike." - It's just a child's game. - What does he mean by that? - Maxy, Maxy, talk to us! - You stop! This is not funny! Sarah: Maxy, what are you doing? Max: My demands were simple-- unless Celia and I played at the provincials together, there would be no bar mitzvah. ( door slams ) ( knock on door, soft piano music playing ) Max, may I come in? It's your house. I, uh... don't suppose the phrase "It was for your own good," would be much help? How about, "When you're older, you'll understand"? I don't understand. There's nothing wrong with trying to maintain a Jewish identity, Max. That's how we've survived for all these years. I think the Brzjinskis feel the same way. Maxy, we're a family. We'll work this thing out. ( sighs ) Good morning. Oh, good morning, Reverend. You're up early this morning. Up late, I'm afraid, Mrs. MacWatters. You must've been praying for this lovely weather. ( sighs ) Among other things. You're getting a very early start this morning. Oh, got to be fast. Weather is very changeable this time of year. You got to strike while the iron is hot, if you know what I mean. Mmm. I know what you mean. ( chuckles softly ) I feel it's going to be a very good day. Time to shake out the dust, get a little fresh air into the musty old corners, if you take my meaning. I do. I believe I do. What? I have one sock? Where-- where are the rest of my clothes? ( all chattering ) Max: The synagogue board decided that since I wasn't having a bar mitzvah, Rabbi Teitelman's trial period was over. Rabbi Teitleman! Klap vider. Peikes, open the door! I'm opening. I'm opening. What is this? Teitelman! Oy gevalt. ( all muttering ) Max: Everybody had an idea about what happened to Rabbi Teitelman. You wouldn't believe some of the theories. Herman and I went to Las Vegas for the weekend. We stayed at the Oasis Inn, but we had to go to another hotel for breakfast one morning. That's where we saw him. Oh, he'd shaved, but I'm sure it was him. Teitelman is a tennis pro at the Gray Rocks Hotel. This is a copy of Modern Dentist. Now here on page 37 in an article about the advances in radical gum-enhancement surgery... this is the answer. Teitelman is an experimental subject of the Viennese Root Canal Clinic. My cousin, Harry Zwicker who is in Israel for his son's bar mitzvah wrote me about a Carl Teitelberg who was cooking for a group troop landing in the Negev. But I know for sure that I can guarantee-- And if you ask me, any man who deserts his post because his uniform is stolen is no man at all. A tailor's view of the world. Desertion. How could he desert? We decided to let him go anyway. What do you know about it? You didn't even fire him properly. - Wait for the election, Peikes. - You're just sour-- He's just sour because Teitelman refused to come to him to sew him up a new outfit. Where would they be without me? Naked. Naked. Moskover, do you know what I admire about you? - What? - Nothing, come on. Do I have a theory? Look, I don't care if he's training to be the first rabbi in outer space. I just don't care. Well, maybe I care a little. I mean, deep down, I'm asking the same question as everybody else.

You didn't say anything about coming here - when you asked me for help. - I'll drive you home in a second. Just wait here for a moment, okay? Max, is your father out the back? Yeah. Good. It's nice to see you, Max. - Hi. - Hi. This wasn't my idea. So, uh, how's the practicing going? You going to be ready in time for the competition? Yes. I wish you were still entered. Really? Yeah, it'd be more fun to win by beating the pants off you. I can get you a good deal on a used piano. Listen, I'm sorry about, you know, how things turned out. Yeah. Me, too. We're a pretty good team, huh? Better than Ferrante and Teicher. Maybe next year? No. I don't think so. Now there should be a switch over here somewhere. Mr. Blackthorn? I don't think my parents like it when people play with the TVs. - That's okay, Max. - What's this about? Would you both come and sit over here? Did you ask them first? Yes, Max, I promise you, it's perfectly okay. Now listen, I want you to promise me that you'll both watch this right through to the very end, okay? - Mr. Blackthorn, I told you, I have to go. - Celia, it's very educational. Educational? Celia. Okay. Max? Okay. And I'll run you home afterwards, Celia. Yeah. ( tap-dancing, ragtime piano music playing ) Man: Thank you very much! That was the Barn Burners all the way from Gimli, Manitoba, and they certainly had things shaking all over here on CWPG's "Talent Time." Our next guest here on "Talent Time", I'm sure you'll find very entertaining. Would you please welcome the comedy stylings of Cal Title? ( cheers and applause ) Comedy stylings? He's got problems. But he's a good dresser. It couldn't be. I think it is. No, it couldn't be. Take two tablets, call me in the morning. - ( rimshot and laughter ) - It is. This-- this is a new experience for me. I mean, never before have I been called Cal Title. I'm glad he didn't use Kelly. My name is actually Calman Teitelman, and I'm very happy, believe me, to be here. He did it. He did it. A friend of mine once told me that he went into a doctor's office, he said, "Doctor, Doctor, I lost my memory. What should I do?" The doctor said, "Pay in advance." ( laughter and applause ) ( lively music plays ) ( laughing ) I went to see the president of my synagogue. He's a very nice man. I said, "Mr. President, you know who I ran into? Old man Berkowitz this morning." "Berkowitz? That meshugenah old stubborn, opinionated-- he spends half the time he should in the synagogue. He sticks his nose into everything." "But he wants to make a large donation." "As I was saying, man of strong principles. Spends half his life in the synagogue. Interested in everything. How much did he give?" ( laughter ) I shaved recently. I figured better a Jew without a beard than a beard without a Jew. ( laughter ) You know the difference between dreams and old socks? There isn't one.

Shh, listen to my little genius play. He plays like he had four hands. He does. ( laughs ) ( laughs ) It's healthy, it's healthy! Max: And that, my friends, is the story of how I came to be standing here today before you on the occasion of my bar mitzvah, the true story, because someone once said it's always worth taking a chance with the truth. Were we really as bad as all that? I had no idea it meant so much to him. Because this is the only place where I can talk without them interrupting. ( laughter ) But I do have to thank them, my father for studying with me so I can get ready on time, my mother for allowing me to invite some special guests this morning, my bubbe for those wonderful orange cakes that you'll be enjoying at the reception in a few minutes, and my zeta because even though I know he's not going to like where this is going, he'll still know that I love him very much. And of course Rabbi Rosenthal for schlepping all the way from Winnipeg just to fill in on such short notice. Now that's what I call a rabbi. Do you think he'll consider moving? From your mouth to God's ear. So I'd like to reserve my biggest thanks to the man who showed me what a mitzvah really is as well as providing most of the material for my speech. ( laughter ) So what does all this have to do with my Torah portion about all the men over the age of 20 who were supposed to fight for Israel? What did they all have in common? They'd all been bar mitzvahed just like me, and they probably spent most of their youths fighting with their parents. ( laughter ) And maybe after all those children grew up, they figured out something that I've just figured out-- that "honor thy parents" and "obey thy parents" aren't always the same thing. Which is why I'm proud to invite you all to the fall provincial music festival to hear the piano stylings of Glick and B-- pardon me-- Brzjinski and Glick. And I really hope that my family will be there to enjoy it with you. Peikes: He's a clever boy, Glick. Maybe he should be a rabbi. My Max is going-- my Max is going to be whatever he wants. So that's it. Thank you all for coming. I'm done. ( whispers ) Max, the reception. Uh, oh, yeah, I almost forgot. I'd also like to invite you all to a small reception, a little food, following Rabbi Rosenthal's closing blessings. I especially recommend the ravioli and wonton. - ( laughter ) - Everyone, please join in. ( all singing in Hebrew ) And don't make me wait another 25 years, you little pisher. ( excited chattering ) Max, they want to know when to start the music. What music? ( singing in Yiddish ) Rabbi Teitelman! ( laughs ) The music is my gift! ( lively folk music playing ) ( song ends, applause )
