The Murder of Hélène Kimmel. The victim's husband, Mr Kimmel, supplied an alibi. Hold him! You're in no state to drive but you can still hold a dog. No, Clara, you're making it up, I didn't drink! So why did you ask me to drive? To make you happy - That's too kind of you! When you make a fool of your wife in front of everyone, you owe her a friendly gesture! 'make a fool of...' If I hadn't said we were leaving, you'd still be there... whispering sweet nothings to your violinist! To Ellie? You're crazy! - It was embarrassing. Like you don't meet enough in secret. Darling, I hadn't seen her for three months. And don't call me 'Darling' please! For three months! What time did you get home on Wednesday? Wednesday? No idea. And if you want to cheat on your wife you should at least know how to lie! Come on, admit it, tell the truth for once! I'll admit, I'll admit, whatever you want. But please slow down Listen Clara! Can I say something? Please, feel free. We've left a house where we'll never set foot again... and because of you. You have screwed up all our friendships. And because of me we're now forced to live all alone! That's frightens you, doesn't it? - Quite a lot, yes. So I think the point which you and I have reached after 4 years... Already? - Only. I suggest once again... - To separate? Never, Walter, you know I don't want to! I don't want to either, I'm against divorce. I hate divorce but now I must divorce you! That's how it is. You remember! - Yes, I do! I remember, I remember. You're not asking me to slow down!... I don't give a shit! What do you want?! What do I want? I don't want to leave you! Wrong, Clara! You don't want me to leave you, that's completely different. But too bad, Clara! It's too late! Oh, what's wrong with you, lady? Can't you signal before you stop? Won't you give me a chance? What's the use, Clara? You've refused them all. I'm so unhappy. I'm sure of it. Me too... So... When we are unhappy together and we can't help each other, well... Really? Clara, you're crazy! Yes, I'm crazy! You've told me so many times! Not me, nor anyone else either! Let me do it, you brute! Ah you love flowers, Mr Kimmel. Yes, flowers are the words of love. There's so many words in this bouquet that I don't know what they mean! Bye, Tony. - Bye! I'll be with you in a moment. Are you're looking for something specific? No. I'm just browsing... Mainly fine arts, architecture... Ah! Right there in front of you. I see. Can I help you? No... well yes, you can. Military architecture, in the Baroque period. Oh, I had a Morello but I sold it Oh, that's too bad. That's the second time I've missed it. It's not an easy book to find, but I'll look out for one for you. That would be good. How much? - Excuse me... Two francs. So, if you want, I'll try to get you one. Yes, please. Come with me, I'll take your name and address. I'll write to you as soon as I've found it. My name is Saccard. Walter Saccard. Walter Saccard? - Yes. 'S', 'A', two 'C' 'A', 'R', 'D'. 'S', 'A', two 'C' Chemin Aurélia. Chemin... Aurélia. so, a Morello... Military Baroque. Mr Kimmel, tell me... Is it you whose wife was killed recently? Yes, but why? Oh, nothing! The name just came to me. A bus accident, I think? No, not an accident, but a murder at a bus stop. Oh yes, that's right, I remember! I'm sorry. - Don't mention it. You knew my wife? No, no, no. I just made the connection because of the name. They didn't find the killer? Of course they were looking for him, but they found nothing. Not for lack of trying. In the end, those gentlemen didn't get very far. Of course they also grilled me, but... luckily, on that day, I went... to the cinema. That little cinema there next to the car. People saw me there, thankfully, so that was it. They gave it up, their case fell apart. I'll take this so I won't have wasted your time. Ah! seven francs. It's a good book and all that, you're right. Here. - Thank you. You're not annoyed if I... - Oh no... No, now I don't even mind talking about it. 'Saccard'... Here! Wise precaution... I could have poisoned you! You could? Because you're going out? Yes. I'm going to the cinema. Without me, of course. You wouldn't like the film at the 'Forum'. You're going with Ellie, of course? No! No, thank you... Right! I won't go to the cinema. Is that the 'Forum' cinema? What time is the film, please? Thank you. It's very nice of you to come with me. Oh! Hello, Ellie! - Hello How was the film? - Yes, great. Well, we're off. She loved it... I was right! It must be terrible. Clara, please! I'm not forcing you to go! But I'm leaving. - And I'm staying! Emergency Exit But that evening, I had gone to the little cinema, that one, across the road. I was seen there, fortunately. an accident? ...no... it was a murder! An assassination. Were you looking for something in particular? Fine arts, architecture? Of course they made an enquiry, but they found nothing. Did you know my wife? Emergency Exit Way Out. The Murder of Hélène Kimmel. The victim's husband, Mr Kimmel, supplied an alibi Hello! Hello! Is that you, Clara? Oh, it's you, Mother. What's wrong with you now? You're always exaggerating. - But the doctor says that... Your doctor exaggerates as well. No, Clara. I don't feel well. I'd like you to come and see me. Oh, you're back? - Mm-hm. Was your film good? Very good. It seems that you agree with her. Was that your mother? - Yes, She's sick, of course. I must come. - And, why not? The mountains at the moment are... - And why 'at the moment'? I'm in good health. Poor thing... She's all alone. No, she's not alone, she has a nurse. Really, since when? - Since yesterday. She's getting worked up. She wants me to come, that's all! And you don't want to? I don't love my mother. And so what? There are daughters who don't love their mothers. Do you love your mother? Um, well... Yes, I think so. - See? You're not even sure. You'd like me to go, wouldn't you? Why won't you even look at me? I'd rather think about something else. Than me? Than you! About Ellie! Ellie! Of course! This has nothing to do with Ellie, Clara! It's about you and me! I think about Ellie only when you speak about her I don't even know where she lives! - Walter! No no, no threats, Clara! I'm not threatening you. And no begging either. Begging? Me? You want to sleep here? Good! Suit yourself. I don't want to! Walter... Yes? Won't you wish me good night? Good night. Walter. Don't you love me any more? Not at all, Clara. And it's a pity. So? So, yes, Clara, I want a divorce. I don't... never! It will take the time necessary... but it will happen. You already tried it, Walter, remember. - Yes. Yes, you promised to kill yourself, and you didn't. And since then, you've wanted to kill me too. So, you see, Clara, I can't live with you any more. I don't want to die... Since I don't want to kill you either, work it out. Not because you don't want to. - Don't say that! Lets say that's exactly why I want a divorce. And this time I won't ask you any more, I'll tell you. We will divorce, Clara. Walter! Won't you say 'Good-bye'? - See you in the evening. Aren't you coming for lunch? - No. You're lunching with Ellie! If you like, it's a good idea! I thought you didn't know her address! I'll find it! Claudia, bring my little white case. Yes, Madam. I say, Jean, - Yes. Can you give me Ellie Briès' phone number? Ellie Briès? - Yes. Don't know if I can give it to you. - Oh, come on. However... It's been lying around... ...on my desk. Thanks. Hotel 'Lotus'? May I speak to Miss Ellie Briès, please? Is that right? Yes, please. Hold on a minute... Thank you. She's moved. - Ah. Yes? Oh, my goodness! Oh no, not at all, on the contrary. That was a good film. Ah yes! That's just what I liked a lot. Yeah. I'll explain it to you. Yes, yes, of course. Oh, not today because I'm in middle of moving No, no, I don't mind at all. Good, all right. So, see you tomorrow. Oh! Take it, quickly, take it! We said tomorrow! I preferred today! But look at the mess here. And then, it's a bet that I made with my wife. But that's of no importance. And why the ice? For the champagne! So, what's the occasion? You'll have a house- warming party, I imagine. Oh, yes! I found this, it's pretty good, eh? Yes, it is. And your house? Still beautiful? No, nothing has changed. I loved your house, When I was able to go there. I'm happy to see you. Put it to cool, we'll put the ice in the glasses. - Yes. No! Not with boiling hot water! Give it to me, bring the ice! Do you know you're my first telephone call here today? Really? What's all this? All sorts of stuff. I never know what to buy. Cold chickens... - Yes! and some fruit... - And then... Really a man who doesn't know what to buy! There's only one thing we can do, A picnic! And of course you hate picnics. You think I'm past the age for that? No, you're not so old! Help me - Of course. I have friends my own age whom I find old Here, open the bottle! - Yes. But with people much older than you... age doesn't matter... Oh my God! Some ice? It's not very good with ice. - No. I have this room and the kitchen which you've seen. Ah! It's nice. And it's practical too. Right next to the Conservatory. I can almost hear them playing from here. What are you thinking about at the moment? You know, your wife wasn't so wrong! I think she was quite right. Was that your bet with her? - Ellie... Why not? She's jealous of me so you decided... - You know, Sometimes I told her: 'Because you're always talking about her, 'you'll end up pushing me into her arms.' So it seems. These are just stories. I didn't need anyone to want you. Me neither. Hello? No, he's still not here. Wait, he's here now. It's your wife, she's called you three times. Answer it! Hello. Yes, it's me. No, I wasn't here. It was... I don't care where you went. It's to say that I'm leaving. I'm going to see my mother. Yes, imagine that, my mother. She's really ill, apparently. Spare me the details, I get it. No, I don't need your car. I have a coach at 5.30. Yes, some mountain air will do me do me a world of good, won't it? And for you, some freedom... And some music! What are you doing here? I didn't ask you to come. I just wanted to say 'Farewell'. - Not 'Farewell'. I'm coming back, you know. Just five minutes. I have to speak to you. It hurts me to see you leaving like this... It hurts you? We're leaving as best we can, you know! But since you're kind enough to make sure I'm really leaving... It's not that... - ...at least it has some use. The upholsterer is coming tomorrow afternoon to do my bedroom. - Yes, I know. I'm no longer interested, but I forgot to phone him. Cancel it. - But why Clara? The house is yours anyway, keep it. On the contrary, it will transform your room, I'm not interested any more. Cancel it! All right, I'll cancel the upholsterer. Will you ring me when you arrive? Where to? Don't pretend you'll be at home tonight! Ah yes, another thing. don't forget to ask Claudia to take care of the dog... Because he will miss me! You're right, Clara, I don't deserve any better. Yet, I wanted so much... You wanted to say 'Farewell'. And you have. My God, Walter, what's the point in watching me leave? If you still have some feeling for your wife The only thing you have for me is anger! Oh Clara, don't think that, I ask you! I don't know how to put it... - So, don't say anything, Let me leave! - Very well, Clara. Will you stay long? So you need me? - Yes. For the divorce. I don't want a divorce, Walter! Even if I cheated on you? Not even then! - I cheated on you! I knew it. No, you didn't know it! You'll never be happy without me. Never! Never! Never! Here they are! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Goodbye, Madame. Into the coach, ladies and gentlemen! There's one missing. - Really? No, there's no one. You can search me! I'd like to, but I don't have time. It's not you by any chance? No, I'm not from the coach. Clara? Clara! Clara! Oh! Nice to see you. - Am I bothering you? No, but you see... I'm sorry, excuse me. What's the matter, Walter? Nothing... Clara left this afternoon, I put her on the coach. Clara went away? - Yes, to see her mother... who... well, she's ill. Oh, poor thing. Oh, you know, Clara and her mother... Listen, go downstairs, I'll ask them to leave, then come up in half an hour. - No, no. No, I have to go home and maybe there'll be a call. From Clara? - Yes, from Clara. We can meet tomorrow if you like. - Of course. Will she be away for long? I don't know yet. OK. See you tomorrow! Murder, accident or suicide? Madame Saccard from Nice found dead on a bus journey. Saccard... Hey, watch out! Saccard. But I'm closed! - I saw you come back. Well, did you like it? - Le Père Marchand Goriot? Yes, it's not bad. The other one wasn't funny. Do you have one on the Crusades? Just on the shelf over there on the right. All right, I'll put this here? I found one, Mr Kimmel! - OK, take it. Saccard. Yes, maybe, it's likely, Do you think she had a reason to kill herself? She already tried it once... with sleeping pills. Seriously? - Very. Ah? - She almost died. And why? She was a very nervous type. From time to time she had breakdowns, depressions... Did she seem in a normal state before her departure? When I left her she was quite tense, emotional. But that was normal. When and where did you leave her? At the coach station, around half past five. And after leaving her at the station? I went back home. - Ah, yes. Excuse me. Here's the jewellery we found on her. There's an earring missing, but we'll find it. Here. An inventory, a receipt, you can check them. Sign here. - Mr Corby? Yes, he's here. Inspector? - Yes, just a minute. Have you the suitcase as well? I can't give it to you, we haven't examined it yet. Hallo? Yes. Right away, yes. OK, we're coming. Right, thanks. Now, if you'd like, I want to show you the place. Do you really think it's... - It's best, yes. All right. If you please. No, no, this way, Mr Saccard. Let's go. Apart from that... no one falls from up there by accident! OK, let's go. Step aside, please... Back up, please. Come away. One moment, gentlemen! Make way! Don't stay there, Madame. I forgot to tell you: I came here last night at the same time as the coach. Is that so? Why didn't you say so? - Well... It's not very smart to lie to the police, Mr Saccard. I knew you were lying from the start. - Yes? That young girl had already noticed your white car. and its make, she told me about it, and I recognised it just now in front of the police station. One thing I don't understand. Since you can't keep things from me Why try to lie? I was wrong. It's stupid. So you saw your wife last night. No, I didn't actually see her, that's why I didn't mention it. You didn't see her? - No, I followed the coach to here, I looked for my wife and couldn't find her. Followed the coach, why? I wanted to talk to her. But you'd just left her! I had this idea suddenly, you know how it is... An unfinished discussion... - Discussion? What about? I don't remember. That's unfortunate. You wanted to tell her something, but she had disappeared? That's right, yes. Could be. If you were so anxious to see her... The coach went off without her and you didn't report her disappearance? Why? Please, gentlemen, not now. - Clear the way... quickly! So, why? I thought she got off at another stop. There's no stop between Nice and here. I didn't know. - Of course you knew... since you were following the coach. - Yes, of course. I'm stupid... What was your relationship? We were going to divorce. - Ah? By mutual consent? No, she didn't want it. That may be why she wanted to kill herself? Was it about the divorce that you wanted to speak to her? Perhaps. Anyway, my mind was made up. Well, thank you. I don't want to leave you to walk home. Well, well! There's something you need to sign, Mr Saccard. Here. Thank you. My condolences. - Thank you. You can go! Absolutely not! Yes? No, Monsieur is away. Who's calling? Yes sir, I'll tell him. ...he was there, he was seen. But it's proof that he wasn't hiding! But, that's important! - OK, he was seen without Clara but not all the time and he wasn't in the café at the moment when she must have killed herself. - That's it. And so? - So... Surely he doesn't think... - Who knows what a detective thinks? Are you afraid? No, I'm not afraid. I'm unhappy. Walter. First you must hide nothing. And your best defence is still that she had tried suicide once before. Yes, thank goodness. I'll take you home now, Ellie. I think for now it's best for you not to be seen together too often. I'll wait for you in the car. Ellie... I think he's right. Of course he's right. And what next? Hello? No, he's away. Who's calling? Poor Walter! Telephone ringing all the time, it's... You shouldn't sleep here. Maybe I'll go to Jean's. - No, here. There was no other way. For me and for her. It's a terrible thing to say. Yes, but I understand... Not completely. But it doesn't matter. When she tried the first time, the day when I knew that she would survive... I began to weep. People thought it was from joy... Maybe that too, But, no... I knew that it would happen again. And you were talking about... ...divorce? She couldn't live without me. And I couldn't live with her. She was crazy. Really, she almost became mad. I could do nothing to cure her. I didn't want to become crazy myself. Sometimes... I even thought, 'I have to kill her.' No, no... Don't be afraid. I didn't see her at the coach stop. Why did you follow her? I have no idea... And I don't want to know. I'm here, Walter. Yes. Yes. you're here. That must be Corby! Get rid of that, quickly! I'm sorry to disturb you, but you know the police have no weekends. Oh, please stay, Madame. You don't bother me at all! So, you said; Ellie Briès... Her address? 42, Rue Lamberti. 42... Lamberti. I wanted to ask you something. It's not the reason I came, but all the same. After her first attempt at suicide, Your wife never showed the intention to, for instance, to try it again? - No, never. Since you wished to divorce, I thought maybe it was that which provoked the accident. so you would have followed her to stop her... no? No. Well, OK, just an idea. I'm digging around. I try to put myself in your place. Your wife liked her dog very much? We're looking at all the different ends. Was she rich? This house belonged to her, that's all. It's yours now? - Obviously. Well, It's a beautiful house. But as I told you, I haven't come to talk about that. More to thank you, Mr Saccard. Me? - Yes. I'll explain. It's about another case a bit like yours. The Kimmel case. You know it? No. Yet you gave me a good idea which allows me to reopen this case again. That really makes me happy... But I don't understand you... - You'll see now. A certain Hélène Kimmel was killed at a coach stop. Murdered... and also during a journey. The marriage wasn't working well. Very, very badly. But Kimmel, as far as I know, was not a man to be content with a divorce. And when I say I'm thankful to you, here's why. Kimmel had a kind of alibi for the murder of his wife. And I don't! - And you don't. But that's not what I wanted to say. What I want to say is, when working your case, I understood how he was able to do it. He followed the coach with his car. Went up to his wife at the stop without being seen, And then, and then, after that... Went home. Like me! - Like you. In short, by this suicide you have put me on the track of an obviously criminal case. Should I be pleased about that? Mr Saccard! I know no one likes the police, but everyone should help them. Whether they want to or not. You did it by accident. So much by chance that if I understand well, You don't even know about the Kimmel case. No! - No... So, Mr Saccard, you are a splendid liar. And it's not the first time. What's that? - Articles on the Kimmel case. They were in your wife's suitcase. She had this with her? - Yes. And she's sending it back to you. The marginal notes are by you, Mr Saccard. I recognised your handwriting... you filled out quite a few papers. Yes, this is my handwriting. Ah, yes! Now I see... - You see what? The name meant nothing to me, but In fact I was driving down the street on that day... I thought it was an accident, ...and then, - And then? And later when I saw it was a crime, it interested me, so I... how shall I put it? Yes, it's likely. It's even possible, and it's probably true. I hope you won't mind me disturbing you for the wrong reason. And of course, you didn't know this Kimmel. No! I've already told you that. - You surely didn't imagine that..? - Listen, Mr Saccard... I have no imagination! and so, if nothing else... you're going to have a little chat with this Kimmel... bookshop That means nothing to you, either? Bookshop? - No, nothing! Pity. So? - Nothing, Ellie, He brought me back a book he had forgotten to put in the suitcase. He was here a while. Oh, he wanted to talk... but I don't like his manners. Where's your glass? - No thank you. Monsieur Kimmel? - Yes. And you are? Inspector Corby. Yes, I know it's Sunday, but... May I..? - Even if I didn't, it would be the same thing. Right! Mr Kimmel, it's about a combination of circumstances. Did you read recently the story of a woman in the newspapers... who was found dead near a coach stop? Ah yes, yes, a coach stop in the mountains, I'm sure I saw it. Yes, it gave me a strange feeling because my wife... Yes, I know. I'm in charge of this case and I also remembered... I try to put myself in their shoes - Whose? - Of everyone. The murderers, the victims, in all their shoes... Because, don't forget, we're also psychologists, Mr Kimmel. Did you think that this woman may have been killed by the same murderer as yours? I... I thought... I thought that the newspapers were saying about this other story... that it was... a suicide.? Oh! Nothing is less certain, Mr Kimmel! And in your own opinion, you think it's a husband's crime? That is, he behaves as if he's guilty. And also, he has no alibi, Whereas, you do. Oh yes, Tony, the charcutier's assistant, saw me at the cinema on that night. And you were never suspected? Maybe I was, but no one ever told me. In the other case, the husband's name is Walter Saccard. Yes, I know. You know him? Oh no, I learnt his name from the newspaper. Saccard followed his wife's coach in his car. At a stop he came to find her. She followed him without suspicion, and thus he was able to kill her! - And after then? And before that, rather! Mr Kimmel, I think you did it in the same way. In the same way for my wife? Yes, yes, yes! If I had killed her, I could have done it in that way, sure! What's interesting, is that Walter Saccard thinks as I do. He worked it out. And this Saccard worked out what? What does he think? That I really killed my wife? Wait... Here. This is what I found among his papers. I have no reason to believe you! Yes it's true, because I'm telling you.! It's none of my business if he likes collecting news items. As for my business, I think it's very interesting. Because? - Just a thought. That kid who claims he saw you at the cinema, the night that your wife was killed... Tony? I was at the cinema with him. Was he sitting next to you? Not very far. Mr Kimmel, In the first place, you never sat next to him. And next, your little friend Tony is not very bright. When I spoke to him more closely... To help his memory along? - Oh, I have my own methods! Well, try it then, if that's all that makes you happy! Get out, I have work! - Which is more important, my job or yours? Mine, little man. Out you go! No one calls me little man, OK? My glasses! My glasses! You're mad! Yes, you can take them off. You know, Kimmel, I can do much better! Bastard! No! No! What have you come here for? I'm Walter Saccard. - Yes, I know, I recognised you. Mr Kimmel... I know that because of me, the police have... Yes. I had cut out the articles. Very interesting. I know also that you suspected me of killing my wife. Or, at least, you thought so. - No, no. I never said a word against you. That's likely! And what else? And... I am very sorry about what happened to you through my fault. So... I wanted to tell you that. Well done, you've said it. And tell me, since you're here, We're going to have a talk. What do you think of this stupid story? That's what I'm interested in. I think you killed her. - Oh, yes? But I don't care. You don't care? Just like that! Why don't you care? Because I think I'm guilty too. I didn't kill her but there are times I think it's the same thing. What the hell do you want with me? What interests me is that the police have come back to me! and we'll both land in the same stew!! And to come and see me when my home is being watched. Do you think that's smart for you and for me? Mr Kimmel, Did you kill your wife? What a question! You think I'd tell you such a thing? I said nothing against you. I wouldn't betray you, But I need to know. I have to know! You can't imagine how important it is for me. From the first day. That's why I've come to see you. To see a man who dared to kill his wife. To give yourself some courage too? Maybe. I didn't know it at the time. And even afterwards when I was following the coach, Like you... - That's going too far! I said goodbye at the station, I was going home. The coach overtook me and I followed it. I couldn't do otherwise. I looked for her at the stop... but I didn't find her. Did I really want to kill her at that moment? Tell me! You! Why have you come to tell me all this? Why me? You're my accomplice. What? And my remorse! Shh, you'll give yourself away! In admitting he didn't have the courage to kill his wife, he's talking about remorse! I don't give a shit about your remorse. I want nothing to do with you! So get out of here! Get out! That's enough of that! Come on, get out! Go! Remorse! So when Saccard paid you a visit, what did he say? Nothing. What!? He didn't spend a quarter hour telling you politely: 'I'm sorry Kimmel for causing you trouble?' I said I'd be in trouble if you found out he'd come to see me. So why protect him? I didn't protect him! I'm not just saying that he knows. If I had something against him, I'd tell you, don't worry. Not so! You protected him because you like murderers! Kimmel, I'm going to finish you off and faster than you think. I know a lot of things about your little friend Tony. Tony? - Tony's on my side, yes. He's completely convinced that you killed your wife! Tony saw me there! - Yes, that's right! He saw you go into the cinema. But now he understands very well how one can go out of a cinema. Another thing... after the show, he came to see you. and you weren't there. Where were you? - My glasses, my... Where were you? - My glasses, where are my glasses? I went to bed. On that night I didn't feel well. Tony didn't come, I would have heard him knock if he came to see me. Where were you on that night? I was in bed! How do you expect me to remember an evening like any other six months ago? Ah, like any other?! Because now you kill a woman every day? I'm sorry, Kimmel, But the only thing you understand is blows. Words and facts don't bother you, because you're mad! You live in your own world, and the only way to get through is to hit you! Come on! I've done nothing. I want to help you. Kimmel! Confess that you are guilty. Confess! I don't know. It seems to be an identical case. That's why he came to see me, where are my glasses? Later, your glasses! Don't forget one thing; It's because of Saccard that you're here. - Yes, I know. So, a bit of movement, eh? Come on, talk! Get up you old shit! Get up! Come on! Look at me, Kimmel. I won't let go of you, you hear? I want you to confess that you killed your wife. And you killed he at the coach stop. - No! if you won't tell me, Saccard will, because he knows! Just as you know that he killed his. I don't know anything! - Liar! My glasses! Give me my glasses! - Your glasses again! Here, your glasses. That's enough for today. Get out of here! That swine! That bastard! That scoundrel! Just you wait! Just wait! To hell with this Saccard! Saccard! Saccard! What are you doing here? Well, well, you have a really beautiful house, Mr Saccard. What right have you to come here? I like pretty things, Mr Saccard. You're afraid, aren't you? No. I love it, it's very beautiful. Really very, very beautiful. - What do you want from me? Quite simply, I've come to return the little visit you made to me, but I'm discreet, because, Mr Saccard, it was noticed that you had come. You see, I've just come from Corby's place. which still shows, by the way, doesn't it? It's nothing to do with me! Nothing? - Nothing to do with me! I'm tired of being beaten up because of you. And you don't know what I'm capable of! - Killing me, maybe? That's all you can think of, imbecile! I have no interest in killing you. Note that I always have a knife in my pocket. And you, in your pockets, have money, eh? Because we need to think about this... You came to see me, shortly before the death of your wife. And so? And so? You came to order a book from me. I have the proof, I have the order, I kept it... With your name, your address, and also the date! Are you going to show it to the police? Well, if you're interested... I can sell you this paper. - You're a real shit, Mr Kimmel! Oh, you're very rich, richer than me, Saccard... You have a beautiful house, my friend. Worth 300.000, at least. If I were you, I'd sell it. 300 divided by 2! 200.000 for me, 100.000 for you... It doesn't all have to be in cash. I'll give credit, you can pay in instalments, You're taking the piss, right? Not a penny, Mr Kimmel! I won't let you blackmail me! Oh, don't use this word 'blackmail'. It's a hurtful word. No, I have a paper of interest, I give it to you. And since you aren't exactly poor, we'll do an exchange, no? No! - Yes! If you drag it out it will becomes more expensive; I'll ask 210, 220...! You're completely crazy! When did I see you? Although you took care not to mention it, didn't you? All right, say it, but for free! Oh, you have to admit that it would be sad. The newspapers won't pay that price, I know very well, but... but maybe they'll offer something to know what you told me in my basement. Maybe they'll publish it, with a photo of the proof. The order form that I tore out. Would you like that? The newspapers... won't publish your nonsense! - That's what you say. I'm not an bad man, Mr Saccard, but I warn you not to push me too far! I've told you my price, and now it's up to you. I'll give you the night to think it over. I've thought it over! You'll change your mind. Sleep on it. And thank God I'm still leaving you the night! And don't come here again! I'll call you tomorrow morning. Monsieur... telephone! I'm not here! I know I should have told you sooner... So you had already seen Kimmel! Yes, to order a book, and that's all! And is that really all? Obviously I talked about the death of his wife. Oh, that's very interesting. But it doesn't prove that I killed mine! Ah no, not really. But you had thought about killing her? Yes. I admit that. But you didn't do it? - I've told you, no! But you had already guessed how Kimmel did it? How he could have done it. Not the same thing. It's strange how you defend each other. Yes, right... in short, you've come for a rehearsal. But... in your version what I don't understand is: what did you go to him for? Why exactly did you go there? At the time, I thought that he had killed his wife, he fascinated me. He fascinated you! - Yes. I wanted to see him. And why did you never say that you were having a relationship with a killer? What relations? - You who clearly intended to kill your wife. I was wrong! I was afraid you'd suspect me from the start, so I thought... Oh, if I understand you well, it's my fault? I'm not joking! - Neither am I, Mr Saccard! I demand you stop this blackmail! We have to hurry, maybe he's already talking about it. It'll be in the papers tonight. I'll read it with great interest. Everything about you and Kimmel... excites me. Fascinates me. Truth can come out from everywhere. The truth? The truth? I'm the one who's telling it! I don't believe a single word of your story, Mr Saccard. And no one in the world will ever believe any of it. See you soon. Goodbye, Mr Saccard! Listen, there's a lack of authority, it's a conclusion. You need to give it more vigour... - Mr Saccard! You see what I mean? Let's do the whole passage again, 8 bars before the coda. Hello, Walter! I called you this morning. Why leave me without any news? It won't happen again, will it? I want to see you very soon, Ellie. I have something rather serious to tell you. Yes, Walter, but I'll be busy for an hour here. Shall we meet somewhere? At your place! - Yes of course, at my place. You still have the key? May I use it? - Yes, I gave it to you. Thanks. See you soon. Thank you! You can't drive around as you want! - Always late, goodbye. Bye! - Goodbye. What's interesting in the paper? Nothing, Ellie. What was the urgent thing you had to tell me? Lots of things. It's been so long since I've seen you. I had the impression that you doubted me. - No. What is it? It's the Festival de Monthaut. It starts today. What were you reading in the newspaper? Everyone's talking about the festival. We can go there tomorrow, if you like. Maybe... Why 'maybe'? Are you doing something tomorrow night? I don't know yet. Tcha! Saccard? It's Kimmel. I've just received a summons from Corby. I hope you didn't tell him... Yes, I did, I saw him. I told him everything. He was great. As you can see, I'm not afraid of the truth. What's this stuff about the truth? It's not the truth which pushed you, you idiot, it's your bad conscience! And you add anything to what I told him, he won't even believe you. I don't give a shit about what you said to Corby The only thing that interests me is what I will tell the Press. That's what should interest you! No one believes you, they won't even publish your lies. What do you bet?! I bet the other half of the house, and I'll win! Hallo! Hallo! And Ellie... Does she know about all this? She knows nothing. - No? I mean, you're still seeing each other? - Of course. And you? What do you think about it? You know, Walter, I'm your friend, you know... Very frankly, I confess I don't know any more. What? Walter, every day we learn things that you've concealed up till now. Really strange things. But, Jean... You surely don't believe what this killer is saying... I don't know what to believe any more. This Kimmel may not be a killer at all. It's you who's says so, isn't it? Exactly as he's says about you. But you, you're haven't brought any evidence. But what do you expect? If he has an alibi. He's producing documents, facts... Well, something at least. - Good morning, gentlemen! Good to see you, Saccard! I've brought the building file for signature. For the garages... there are two possibilities... either we can build separate garages or a garage in common. In my opinion, the client should... You bastard! Eh? Come on, come on, it's ready. ...and I'll tell you the rest in detail, Thank you, Miss. On his second visit to me in my shop, Saccard told me the following story: 'I had put my wife on the coach, 'and then I left immediately afterwards. 'But suddenly, just by chance, I saw the coach passing in front of me, 'So I started to follow it. 'When it stopped at La Cayolle,' This is still what Saccard said. 'I parked my car close by, 'and I went back to the rest stop. 'My wife was just coming out of the coach last. 'so I was able to go up to her straight away. 'So no one could have noticed me. 'She reproached me for coming, 'However, she went with me to the garden, 'down below, right next to a wall overlooking the ravine, 'And there we began to argue again.' What was the quarrel about? He didn't tell me that. However, I know that it became quite lively. 'She wanted to run away'... This is still what he said in his story that I'm telling you. He then wanted to hold her back so he struggled. He said that he lost his composure. She cried out and he became afraid, Suddenly his nerve failed him, And then he pushed her into the void. But no one heard any of this? No! Ah yes, I forgot to say one thing. Because it seems just at this moment, a train passed by... a huge... ...an endless train. And during the noise it whistled as well... So no one could hear anything, I even remember his expression. He said: 'It was a real stroke of luck!' The first visit Saccard made to me was two days before the murder of his wife. Have you any evidence of the confidences he made on that day? Alas no, I don't have a tape recorder. But what I can prove, and this he hid from everyone, is that is he came to see me. See, there's your proof. An order form, written to his dictation: 'Walter Saccard, Chemin Aurélia'... With the date, eh? 20th May, two days before his crime Ah no no, I won't give you that! - Can we photograph it? Of course. I brought it for that. But this only proves that he ordered a book. Wait, wait! This paper, he remembered it later, and if he came to see me in my shop it's because he was afraid and wanted to buy it off me. 5,000 francs he offered me first and when I kicked him out he went up to 10,000. Isn't that proof? And here's the famous order form. What do you think of it? He has a horrible voice. - And Mr Saccard has a nice one? Yes! - Sorry, I'm not a musician. And even if Mr Saccard has a lovely voice, he's quite a liar! Did he tell you he had gone to see Kimmel in his shop? Did he tell you he went back to his basement, and that he was collecting press clippings of Kimmel's murder? No? You're learning everything from me. And you, why do you still pretend to believe him? And you, why do you believe this one? Because he speaks and then he gives some proof! Proof! You know very well that Walter's wife tried suicide. - And she failed! But that could give a husband ideas. He had no reason to kill her! However, he admitted one thing; That he thought about doing it. And did he tell you that? No. - He said that to me. But what does that prove? All men might want to kill... to kill their wives. Don't you? - I'm not married. So much the better for you! Because she would kill you! And you've never had the desire to kill someone? Didn't you want to kill Walter right now? But if I told you how much I'd like to kill you. Oh, I believe you, my girl! Right now, yes. Later you won't think any more about it. We say: 'I want to kill', then thinking of something else, we don't do it. That's the whole difference between a murderer and a non-murderer. There are people for whom the urge to kill becomes overwhelming. It's there all the time, it fills their minds. It eats up everything, so then they kill. Only not to think about it any more. Maybe they do it to think about something else. And they carry on as if they'd never killed. Unfortunately, for that, you have to have been one. And so, Saccard. That's what happened to him. No. Maybe something happened in his life, between him and his wife, something, but not a crime! Something he'll never talk about, not even to me, and he's right. for things like that, no one has the right to ask anything. But just by asking questions, you force people to lie. But the real liar is the one who wanted to know. Leave us alone! All right, I'm going to try to make you lie. The very night his wife died, he spent with you. No! - He didn't come to see you that night? He didn't even come in, I had friends over! Are you lying to yourself or not? One or the other. Either he's told you everything, or said nothing. in which case he had something to hide, Either way is equally interesting. I've had enough! But I haven't! I have plenty of time. Do you want one? I've had enough! But I know he's lying. That's not what frightens me. What frightens me that you've lied so much to me. I haven't lied to you, Ellie! But not telling the truth is the same. Every time it's like now with this blackmail thing, because you were forced to. Yes I know. But... Yes, that's how you tell the truth, in saying: 'it's true that I'm lying'. No I couldn't, I didn't want to to involve you in these horrible things! But why? What do I mean to you? No more than anyone else? I can understand you lying to everyone, but to me! Am I really like everyone else? What can I do about that? Maybe if you tell me something very important... Something you've never told anyone, something for me, just for me. I'd like to, but what? You know everything, now. I don't think so. Yes. One more thing... the last one I have... I give to you. Then I will have told you everything. Is it bad? It's dreadful, Ellie. Tell me. When I said goodbye to Clara on the coach, just before she was leaving. I told her the truth. Everything that happened here between us. The champagne... The first time... So, she knew. At that time, I don't think I could have told her anything worse. No. And that's why she killed herself. Maybe. So you... - Ellie... I swore it to you. That was when you were lying, Walter. What I did may have been even worse. Now, it's as if I also had killed her a little. Ellie... Do you want me to be an accomplice? Do you remember a day when you said: 'There's no other way'. Not a day. A night. But that's what you have to tell them! This is real proof that she killed herself that you had... I don't want to say that you had nothing to do with it, But you didn't do it! Go and tell them that, Walter. No, no, Ellie. This doesn't concern them. It's only for you and me, between us... Just us. As if we had a secret? - Yes. We'll never leave each other. - Maybe. You never give a straight answer. Tell me the truth. - The truth is, no! Never again. Forever? - Forever. Forever? I'll go there. How will you tell them? That I don't know, but it has to stop. Right now there's a lie going around and I will stop it. You, dear, go and wait for me there. - At the concert? Won't you come and get me? I don't want you to miss the beginning, and I may be some time. Go and wait for me there, like a a big girl. See you later. And above all, don't worry about me! What is it? - Monsieur Saccard. Let him in! I was expecting you, Mr Saccard! I thought that as soon as Miss Briès told... Don't talk about her, he mixed her up in this blackmail... I'm not talking to you! - You've talked to him enough! Today we're going to confess! The young man has already, Kimmel is next and that leaves just you. I have nothing to confess. Everything this blackmailer told you... Please don't quarrel. Blackmailer or not, I wouldn't know, and anyway I don't care! And I'm happy to let the newspapers publish all this. This for instance! Yes, I went to his house. I told you myself. But why did I go? I said nothing! - He knows very well. So publish, I don't care, Whatever. I'll attack him: He asked for the money. - No, no no! I always thought he killed his wife! I still believe it! And I'm saying so! - Convincing! Since he's not guilty, did you kill yours? Enough! Not with me, eh! Now you're going to be reasonable. I tried to be considerate with you, but it didn't work. - Considerate? I can see that you don't know about the others! Ask Kimmel! I don't want to cause a scandal, but if I give this to the press... Be sure that it's just the beginning for you! I'll end up by having you; you'll end up by cracking. I've had enough of your behaviour. - And I of yours! But you have superiors and I know where to complain! So try it then! My superiors are not happy with my work. Ha ha! Nice work! - Pretty nice, yes I'm going to solve two cases. One of which was buried a bit fast. Isn't that so, Kimmel? How many times did I say that I didn't kill my... He killed her, you know! And it's thanks to you. You bastard! You insolent bastard! You, you, I could... No way, you... Hey, he doesn't like you, does he? Tony? - Yes, Mr Corby? You're not saying much. The silence of a clear conscience. He understands very well that you left the cinema straight after you went in. He even remembers that after the show he looked for you everywhere without finding you. That's right, Tony? He didn't say that! - Shut up! But I'm telling you that's not true! Tony knows too, like everyone else, that your wife had a lover. It was all the same to me! - Yes? But what wasn't all the same was that she carried on openly with him, told everyone you were impotent, and said that just looking at you gave her goose flesh. Admit that it's not nice to hear that. Then he would come for coffee in your home! And you, twisted, resentful, would sit between the two of them like a fat eunuch! Admit that you don't need more to kill a woman! - No! - Yes! Come on, get up! Come on, confess, confess! This man is your downfall, Kimmel! This Saccard... This blunderer, this half-wit. This murderer. - So, arrest me! No way, that would be too easy for you. I'll get your confession first. Never! OK! That's it! Try it, I'll shoot.. So arrest me! I've threatened a policeman. Arrest me or I'm leaving. Right! Come back! Come back, Saccard. I told you to stay, you hear me? Are you afraid? - Of course I'm afraid, you're armed and you're crazy. - Go on! Certainly! Everyone's crazy here, yes. I'm crazy with joy! He's crazy with laughing, and he's crazy with fear! And you crazy. Crazy for confiding in him. I never confided in him. - No? Shall we listen to it? It might come in handy for your defence. During his second visit to my home, Saccard told me the following story: 'I had put my wife on the coach, 'and then I left. 'Suddenly, just by chance, I saw the coach passing in front of me, 'So I started to follow it. 'When it stopped at La Cayolle,' This is still what Saccard said.

Because it seems just at that moment, a train passed by... a huge, an endless train. And during the noise it whistled as well... No one could hear anything, I even remember his expression. He said: "It was a real stroke of luck!" That makes you laugh, you idiot?! But there's no train where my wife died! Hey... I say... Tell me, Kimmel, The railway line, it passes right by the place where your wife was murdered! You bastard! You damned bastard! Bastard! You pig! Oh! OK OK! That's enough for today! Looks like you'd better leave. You've upset him. He's becoming nasty! Murderer! Murderer! Well, that's nice to hear: A murderer who calls the one who got him caught a murderer! Poor old Kimmel! You poor thing, what bad luck, eh? You wanted to blackmail him, and he didn't give you a penny. And also, he's cleared! Yes! To make a point, as a temporary measure I can console you. But in your place Kimmel, I wouldn't be very proud of myself. And not very pleased with Saccard... No, not at all, at all, at all! Inspector! - Yes! The Commissioner wants you. - Yes. I'm coming, I'm coming. Boss? - Say, Corby, The kid's parents are here to take him away. You've kept him nearly an hour. Release the kid right now. Another thing, I don't like this story about the tape... and the two blackmails against blackmail. If the journalists find out, we'll be in the shit. Then you promised to solve both cases at the same time. Instead of that you haven't advanced one inch, neither in the Kimmel case, nor the Saccard case. So, you have till the end of the week. Then I'll take you off both cases. As for your promotion, - It'll be finished,.. Get on with it! Those are my orders! That's all I have to say! So, where's Kimmel? He just left. You can go too.
