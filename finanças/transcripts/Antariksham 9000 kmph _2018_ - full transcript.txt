-Esub by Ashik - Bride hunting again, huh? - Yeah, as usual! - What happened now? - It's Mihira satellite - It was fine, what now? - Don't know Technical or battery issue - When did you get to know? - 20 minutes In this crucial time, imagine! - Is sir aware of this? - He'll be here at any moment I've initiated Mihira satellite battery usage, 60 seconds to go - If it fails what is the situation? - This is an old satellite, Mohan Already NASA Deep Space network has a back up So telecommunication not being affected - Our worry is considerably lessened - True If zero emotional attachment no need to worry at all! 60 seconds over Only old coordinates showing up Why isn't it showing the position? Very important to know the satellite's location 'Anand, try this' Get information from the nearby satellites With the help of their path trackers trace Mihira satellite's current position Okay, sir 'The entire online navigation and guidance system has failed' 'Redundant systems are not responding either' This is the most prestigious project with Russian coordination 'Manned mission' Matter of immense pride 1st time Indians are being sent to space 4 astronauts from India If we don't bring Mihira under our control this project can turn into a disaster We can't let that happen Sir, we need an expert to set our telemetry settings Connect our astronauts undergoing training in Russia on a video call Quick...! 'Convoy, this is Control' 'Proceed with Crew Egress, over' 'Checking configuration' Karan, you guys have a call from Indian Space Centre 'Copy' - Hi - 'Hello, sir' - Adithya or Karan? - It's Adithya Karan has gone for simulation test and Sanjay will also join us We have Riya Sir, even we got to know only now We are all really shocked! We don't have enough time You must return to India at once But Adithya and Karan's simulation test is in 2 days '1st you have to come, Riya We can bring them back later' We are expecting you back here tomorrow, okay? Yes, sir - Grandma - Riya 4 years have gone by Why have you lost so much weight? You always say this, grandma Refresh yourself and come eat, dear I have to leave, grandma You just got here If you don't even rest for a day- No time, grandma Actually... ...it's very urgent What is so urgent, dear? I'll tell you after I get back, okay? I still remember the headlines then Mihira Satellite Lives In Sky It was such a proud moment for our country That satellite was launched 12 years ago Missing its position isn't a big surprise! We...we really should have been more careful Welcome, Riya Good to see you Mihira satellite is travelling at 2000 kmph In its orbit Every 24 hours... ...it falls short of a distance of 2 km 'Since it is drifting...' '...in almost 45 days' ...it may collide with IMS-1 satellite in the lower orbit Loss from this collision is not for our satellite alone, sir This debris moves at a speed of 2000 kmph in space That debris will hit the satellites of neighboring countries '...which in turn will hit other satellites' The fault in our Space Centre may cause a black-out in the world's communication Sir, it's a COD systems failure We configured Mihira satellite system with the old code After that when the last scientist Sharath Singh in the team retired... ...knowledge transfer was done to Dev Sharath Singh died of cardiac arrest 2 weeks later Now we don't have anyone qualified to modify the code The necessity to teach anyone didn't arise Tell me one good news, Mohan, please - There is one, sir - What is it? We can ask Dev to transfer knowledge to 1 of these astronauts As soon as he enters space he should be able to fix Mihira 5 years since Dev left! He isn't even in touch with us I know where Dev is, sir But it's difficult to bring him here I'll convince him, sir I feel it's my responsibility I suppose you know why Dev quit? 5 years back when a similar situation came up... ...we failed, Riya History should not repeat itself! Yes, sir 'Area 407' 'We are setting it up' 'Ready to test in 5 minutes' What...? Emotions, huh? Should be, Mohan Shouldn't come here with mere knowledge This Space Centre's history began with sacrifices I mean this... ...this is my baby! - What's so funny? - No emotions for this call, huh? 1 week since my call was answered Will I reciprocate so easily? Not like that Quite often the scientist and lover in you have a tug of war, eh? You should see your face then I mean that anger Like a rocket ready for launch! That's enough What's the status? Everything is fine T&C Subsystem inspection is scheduled Team from Bangalore has been deployed Inspection isn't over? - Who is doing it? - Ground team We'll get the report in few hours Telemetry and command subsystem not receiving any signal 'Status is negative, sir' Urgently need an engineer System isn't receiving any signal No...no...we don't have time Send an expert immediately We need someone extraordinary on board right now, immediately What the hell is this, Mohan? You know T&C Subsystem plays a crucial role between ground control and spacecraft, eh? How can that be messed? Because of this, status, configuration, balance parameters will be affected How did you send it without checking in the 1st place? You overlooked it, Mohan Dev, didn't I tell you Bangalore team prepared it? Everything will be alright 'Hardly any time left for the launch' Everything will be alright 'Hardly any time left for the launch' Vishal, what's the status? Sir, this is not responding Try again with final position - Connect it, come on, quick - Sure, sir Sir, still not responding Thank you Hi...Riya Came here to troubleshoot T&C Subsystem You look very young Shall I come back after 10 years? I...I'm Mohan Technical Department T&C Subsystem not generating signal No reception even after restart Okay, let me check Equipment or control unit? 1st I must check the system settings - Follow me - Yeah We'll report about the status of T&C Subsystem Thank you If door mat is in, it's 'pull' If it's out, it's 'push'! Basic interview question What? New intern, huh? Dev, I'm sorry This is Riya Our new Systems Engineer Come to inspect T&C Subsystem Why is she here when unit is near the launch pad? Why test the software to assemble hardware? Any issue 1st system settings should be checked It's a simple interview question?! - Where's the system? - This way Fresher, huh? Can she do it? She looks tense First time, huh? No, I've been tense many times before! Hey, what the- Riya, do you need support staff? Do you need help handling this? No...no...I can do this myself As of now I'm overwriting the manual This isn't the time for experimenting Everything will be fine if I do the simulation test What does 'fine' mean? You should be giving your best here I find it difficult to focus if you're here Please can you give me some space? Dev, you go...go Can't believe this! We should check T&C Subsystem now - Shall we go? - Sure If it doesn't work now, international Space Centres will defame us Don't worry I'm sure it will work If a person is given the respect he or she duly deserves... ...the task can be completed properly That's common sense Please don't misunderstand Dev He's a gem and this is his 1st satellite launch Anyone in his position will behave the same way He also underwent astronaut training in Russia Don't mistake pride for arrogance This is a fully redundant unit So in 2000 b/s data rate- You need any help? No...no...I'm just checking a few parameters 'Temperatures' Frame synchronization '16-bit error detection code' Spacecraft identification It's done! Good, let's go You go back You come here Okay Satellite is really important in our life Be it the weather forecast Or functioning of TV and radio Or GPS working perfectly ...we depend on these satellites So if we have to progress along with the world - What do we need? - Communication Without communication... ...we won't know any information from anywhere or anyone Thanks to these satellites... ...conversation between 2 people ...messages and calls can transpire If communication is not proper... ...sometimes messages won't be replied nor calls answered Students What's the name of the satellite sent now to orbit the moon? - Viprayaan - Good But by orbiting the moon what does Viprayaan do, teacher? Viprayaan will study the availability of water in moon Why check in moon when we have plenty of water here? We do, but the question here is not about water It's about our nation's pride Thinking we talk directly to one another if Graham Bell hadn't invented the telephone ...will we have cell phones today? Thinking we talk directly to one another if Graham Bell hadn't invented the telephone ...will we have cell phones today? Similarly if this moon mission is carried out... ...we will lay the foundation for many future inventions Why go now for something which will happen many years later? Once this was a jungle, but now? This Space Centre is here Unless someone takes the 1st step how will any journey begin? Children, remember this Even a journey of 1000 steps begins with a single toddler step Whatever happens, the responsibility to provide the future generation their needs is ours...yes or no? Yes, sir So, if Viprayaan satellite succeeds... ...we will be the 1st in the world to discover the presence of water in moon What if it fails? Come here Do you know the story of kings, wars and soldiers? Yes, I do Soldiers who fight in wars never think about defeat They want to win at any cost No other option Same with Viprayaan This satellite is also like a soldier Never ask if it will fail Think only of how it can succeed So remember, kids Failure is not an option - What are we looking for? - Water - Where? - Moon Good Wait...wait Stand in a queue - Shall we meet the director? - Yeah 'Keep quiet, kids' Follow the teacher - Hey Paru - My students are here Rekha...I will be back It's all right, madam Hey, Dev I am sorry I'm feeling hungry Shall we go out? - Bunking with the teacher, huh? - Of course! Dad, actually- Change of plans again? My daughter eats healthy food - Don't feed her junk food - Sir I have a home too Okay, carry on Thanks, sir To your place again, huh? 'The Nectarous Night' - Food's ready - Do you call this food? - Huh? - Okay, give - Dev, please - No - I'm hungry - No Kiss me and I'll give you Give me the plate I'll comply I didn't mean food, kiss first Waiting! Cheating! Like how a Math teacher usurps a 'Games' period? Kiss properly Hey, hold this - Hello? - 'Dev' - Mohan, what's the status? - 'It's working' 'That new girl Riya solved it' Okay, I'll be there Hmm...kiss now Is the teacher angry now? Want to punish me? Should I stand up on the bench? If you make the teacher cry you'll lose your eyesight! When the satellite launch photo is published in the papers tomorrow... ...1st to get emotional will be ...your teacher! Anyone else can only follow! Anyone else? I have no one else to care for me other than you Tomorrow when we have a baby of our own... ...I need to practice now! Eat Replay of my own TLC, huh? You always win, I give in You win and I'll celebrate your victory "Hands of the clock" "Why rush headlong? Stop your tick-tock" "O' time precious" "Give us a chance please to cherish more moments of peace" "At a point in time when hands clasped sublime" "A journey divined where eyes intertwined" "A purely magical state when breaths mingled in haste" "Happy moments many with colors of harmony" "Each second and minute of every day" "O' moment, don't tick away" "Suffused in sweet flavor as 2 hearts merge as 1 forever" "Don't let go, listen and savor" Hey! 1 second - Okay - Thanks Sorry, made you wait It's okay Nothing wrong in waiting for miracles Viprayaan is not only your dream It is our dream "I ponder in wide eyed wonder if the moon in the sky has traces of water" "I can't see now however" "But tears of joy from the face of this moon on earth's surface" "I keep seeing always" "My equal half she is My whole world of bliss" "When swinging in rhapsody in many notes of melody" "7 worlds and 6 phases of time" "When those stars open their doors divine" "When happiness abounds When sweetness surrounds" "Don't let the promise of this dream disperse into emptiness for better or worse" Hey Paru, why do you love me so much? I thought of this very often I couldn't come up with the right reason A love for no reason is a feeling beyond comparison "O' moment, don't tick away" "Suffused in sweet flavor as 2 hearts merge as 1 forever" "Don't let go, listen and savor" 'Thunder storm anvil is within 19 km of the flight path' 'Fly through a debris cloud for 10 minutes' Dev, very little time left for the launch We can abort this mission now I mean wind currents are not in our favor If anything goes wrong it will be big shame 'Wind speed is 32 knots' 'Cloud gathering 1100 meters' Sir, we are ready to launch Viprayaan Dev...! Don't worry It won't go wrong It's my baby 'T minus 10' '9...8...7' '6...5...4' '3...2...1...' 'Zero...' 'We have a lift off' 'Namaste, madam' Where is house 18B, opposite Lord Ganesha temple? What do you want? Dev - Oh! Dev sir, huh? - Yes That is his house 'Isn't it 10 o'clock now?' 'You'll find him in the school' - School? - Govt school Go to the main road Anyone there will direct you Okay, thank you 'Atmospheric pressure is caused' '...by the gravitational attraction of the planet' Note it down Pure water boils at 100°C It will rain today - Air pressure - Low Pressure is directly proportional to the- Where is Dev sir? - 6 A - No, 6th B - Where...that side? - Yes - Okay, thank you - 'Welcome' 'When the sun heats the ground and warm air rises...' As the air rises, it cools down Water vapour condenses to form clouds So when the condensation point is reached ...large cumulonimbus clouds are formed Hence heavy rainstorms occur - This is called as - Convectional rainfall I need a favor We are in a real difficult situation Are you still working there? No one takes up a job there to leave it! We are all on national duty Even coming here in search of you I am on national duty - What's that? - Mihira Sat That satellite was sent long ago - You are here for that? - That isn't the problem We are unable to control it Mihira and IMS-1 are on a collision course It can cause a black-out on world communication God forbid if that happens... ...program of sending astronauts into space will be affected, Dev It's not my headache Listen, if you come it will be of great help Riya, I'm no longer considered fit for the job I'm sorry It was my mistake on that day and I'm really sorry - Don't rake up the past - That's why I am here I need yo- I'm sorry Your presence is very very important for us, Dev But not for me Whatever happened has happened Can't turn back the clock What can I do after 5 years? Listen, please At least save whatever is under your control It is not related to you and me or to those few in the Space Centre This concerns our nation, Dev Please Okay, but I can't come I'll email the commands To understand them, get trained and to execute them ...depends on the talent of 'your' Space Centre Students have their exams tomorrow So if you can please leave Dev There are 3 types of people in the world 1st, who don't know what to accomplish 2nd, they know what to accomplish but give up when a problem arises 3rd, accomplish at any cost You know a few weeks back... ...NASA traced Viprayaan's location? You used to proudly say then 'it's my baby'! That's why I passed on this information to you Hello...Mohan? 'Dev said he won't come' He is willing to email the commands 'Dev has changed very much, Mohan' 'To such an extent' ...he refers to our Space Centre as 'your' Space Centre! 'Okay, see you soon' 'We sincerely thank NASA' '...for finding the lost Viprayaan' 'We are indebted to them' 'But Viprayaan by now is as good as a dead object' 'Mohan, emergency in Viprayaan's position in the lunar orbit' 'It's ADCS error' Dev, we'll burst crackers in our wedding too Wedding is celebration Not pollution! You have absolutely no taste Hmm...I know! Then I won't marry you, get lost! Today is the happiest day of my life Viprayaan will collect data today And in a short while transmit data Finally you agreed to marry me I will have a family of my own Like a rocket kissing the sky Paru, 1 second From my office Hello...? Hey...be careful - Like this - Paru I got some work to do in my office, it's urgent Hey Lakshmi, keep an eye Dev, I'll come with you - No need, Paru - Dev, please Let me just come with you in the car Don't want to be away from you even for a minute Okay, get in 'Current coordinates of Viprayaan are not retrievable' Dev will be here in 10 minutes Let's wait for Dev Don't have that much time Connect him over phone Dev, nothing will go wrong Don't be so tense Hello, Dev is driving He will be there - Almost there - Paru - In 10 minutes - Turn on the speaker Riya, what's the problem? Dev, it's an ADCS error Viprayaan's coordinates are missing In 300 seconds we are going to lose everything Tell me the pre execution values of ADCS Roll 8° Pitch 4° Yaw negative 10° Okay, change Roll to 10° - Pitch to 5° - Okay And mean orbital velocity to 0.8 km per second Yeah 'Riya, execute' It's...it's not responding 'Dev, orientation is changing with your values completely' 'It will make Viprayaan get closer to North pole' 'Moon's gravity is weak over there' - We are going to lose everything - Riya, calm down Dev knows what he is saying He may know what he is saying but what will be the repercussion? He really doesn't know 'Dev, are you there?' 'Only 200 seconds left' 'Tell some other option' Change Roll to 15° Pitch to 10° And MO to 12 km per second It's not working Showing error 'Need to reconfigure orbital inclination' Riya, just enter the values I said Change the maneuvering prograde motion settings Riya, just attempt it Don't delay Dev!! Dev...Dev, are you still there? Dev What did Dev say? - Riya...? - He is not responding - Paru? - Dev Paru, you will be fine Nothing will happen to me You...your dream Viprayaan - Nothing will happen to you - Dev, don't let it go - You'll be fine when I am here for you - Don't let go Paru...Paru! Dev Check this once We didn't even get Viprayaan's coordinates - We lost it completely - Not possible There must be something Last position Last received data Dev, you are very disturbed I don't know how to tell you You need to take a break, Dev There was no response to the values given by us Damn! ADCS, why were the settings not changed? Dev...? Dev, look at me Viprayaan is no more It's dead What the hell is this, sir? Can't we bring it back? Can you bring my daughter back again? This is Paru's last wish Whatever happened because of you is enough "Talk…talk to me now" "Speak up, my life, my love" "Decide where to bend Which turn to take and when" "Destiny again due? Is this another journey for you?" "Look! Stories of yesterday and the day before on display" "Here…for a bright future; to show the way lamps of tomorrow and day after in array" "There or here…which way ahead? Where do these rose-petal feet tread?" "Pulling towards the burden of a bond?" "Or pushing towards the distance beyond?" "Or on safe shores friendly and fond?" "Towards shores beckoning a bond" "Only on shores friendly and fond" Do you remember Dev? I'm not to blame in that issue, grandma I know Eat please Why did you think of that now? I didn't trust Dev when I should have I have no faith he'll come back now Yeah? Dev? Can't believe my eyes - Almost 5 years - Yeah So good to see you I believe Viprayaan was found True, it has been traced but nothing can be done about it Do you know Viprayaan has recorded data? But bad luck We couldn't retrieve that data But that's old story We are moving forward now We are sending 4 astronauts into space Our best Indian astronauts trained in Russia 72 revolutions around the earth for 2 days I want to meet the director Yeah, sure He'll definitely be very happy to see you Yes, of course Excuse me I'll call you back - How are you? - Same as you! Still single? No one else is my world other than her, sir She shares even my solitude 'In every student's smile I can only see her face' I am alone But I am not lonely Are you aware of the task you have to do on priority basis now? We have run out of time We have a big problem That's why I'm here with a solution Tell me What is it? Send me, sir I'll fix Mihira, directly Send you...where? To space I'll correct the code manually using wired protocols We don't have time to listen to your jokes! I'm not in the mood to joke Do you think this is taking a P.T class in school? - That's impossible, Dev - In that case I'm sorry I can't train someone in this short a time Dev, be reasonable How is this possible? At least this time try to be a team member Don't behave like a dictator! Do you realize how serious this is? I do, that's why I'm asking you You have no other option Sir, you know I'm a trained astronaut I can do this Dev, listen to me once Stop making a fool out of yourself People respected you a lot here Don't wipe that out There's no bigger disgrace than losing without trying, Mohan Trust me on this We have no other option Don't experiment on it No instructions on the command module manual Trust me, Karan, it works Dev, they are the astronauts who got trained in Russia Do you know Riya also got trained along with them 4 years of training Must be really hard, right? Not really We are born for this We both shared this ambition from our childhood It isn't our dream to travel into space It's our life And we are meant to do this together - Nice - And you are...? 'He is Dev' He needs no introduction He has successfully coded so many satellites You inspire me, Dev 'He's Sanjay Also trained from Russia' He's here to help you with Mihira if necessary Oh great! We are in good hands then This space ship is called 'Jatayu' Its parts have been manufactured in India Our country's 1st indigenous space flight - Good to know - Gentlemen You must be tired after your travel You guys need rest Mohan, take care of them Come on Let's go See you later, Dev Hello, sir - Please give me few minutes, sir - Okay We've been trained for 4 years with utmost dedication This mission for those twins- It's an emotional attachment No one will be willing to give their space to you or support you 'Dev' - What? - As long as I support you ...didn't I tell you no one can hinder your dream? Proud of you, my boy I feel like I am hugging the moon close to my heart Love you What is this? Forever obsessed with the moon! Why are you so mad about the moon? Do you know the moon's speciality? It can't delete darkness With its tiny glow it can change even darkness into a thing of beauty Like your smile is a joy forever That's why I love the moon as much as I love you And I love you as much as I love the moon Hearing you say this ...I don't want to be away from you even for a minute Okay, I'll help Dev How much longer with that beard? Astronauts can't sport that thick a beard I know everything You deserve to be an astronaut 'Silence!' '4 of our astronauts will be carried into space by this space ship Jatayu' 'It is named after a legendary bird' '...which showed the way for a goal to be achieved' 'The astronauts travelling in this will revolve the earth 72 times' 'So far no country in the world has achieved this goal in such a low budget' In life, you know what is the height of disappointment? 'Not spending time with our children when they are kids' Son or daughter? Daughter 4 years since I saw her I started my training right after her 1st birthday She hadn't even learnt to call me 'dad' You must have missed her a lot, right? From holding her hands to walk to hearing her 1st baby-talk I missed everything Children grow up so fast, Dev Don't know why they are in such a hurry Not realizing when we are in that phase and realizing its child-like nature later That's childhood Not possible to add an extra chair for you 1 of the 4 astronauts should drop out for you to go Maximum speed of a space flight is 7000 kmph If we exceed that we'll face major problems and airlock life status will turn to red 'Excuse me, Mohan' What about- Dev, explain trajectory diversion also I'll do it later Mohan, continue Dev, we are running out of time When is 'later'? Adithya, I got some other work Let's do it later Who are all going? - 4 astronauts - I didn't ask how many I asked you the names I don't know Dev We need to debug velocity controller of Mihira We can schedule that later Karan Aadhi? Hasn't the coding session with Dev been scheduled? What are you doing here? He postponed it He is also reviewing the flight controls I don't know what's happening 'This is from the director of Indian Space Centre' 'To all other Space Centres' directors' 'Listen to me, although we've planned our manned mission after 40 days' '...we are sending our astronauts in the next 10 days to rectify the damage' 'Mr Chandrakanth I want you to understand this' 'IMS-1 satellite and Mihira satellite are in collision course' 'This debris will collide into the satellites of other countries' 'Causing a chain reaction' 'This will lead to worldwide communication black-out ' 'And your country will be responsible for that' 'If this is bound to happen...' '...then we have to take required measures' 'Your 1 mistake can put all the other countries in trouble' 'And we can't let this happen' Yes, sir Dev is stubborn He refuses to part with the code to Adithya We have just 2 days for our flight launch Sir, Dev is fit to be an astronaut Upon detailed review I don't see any complications He has already been trained once He was certified as one of the best, sir Yes, sir I think he can handle it I know the complications of Mihira satellite Only Dev can fix that If Dev has to be sent instead of me ...I'm willing to stay back 2 flight controllers are compulsory in command module Karan and you should be there Dev doesn't know flight controlling And Riya must be there for fixing Mihira Sir, on the oxygen purge system Mohan, turn on the simulation test Okay Excuse me 4 years back this plan was designed While we shed blood and sweat for our country... ...how can you barge in all of a sudden? Okay, I agree You are a very successful man But mental condition is also important for an astronaut Patience, decision making, calmness, composure I don't think you have any of these He couldn't even control his car A life was lost If such a man is taken on- Karan, stop it I need you to answer this, Mohan The 4 of us struggled for the same dream for 4 years How can you add someone not even trained now? - Adithya, listen to me - Negotiation? This isn't for you and me Entire nation will be affected you know? - Exactly - What 'exactly'? Mihira's knowledge is transferred to you Now do that to me I will fix it That's not possible When you can travel in such a short time ...why can't knowledge be transferred to me? After sharing space in our mother's womb... ...this space mission is our combined dream I am not talking about goal but about rights Nurturing love for something for few years Dreaming about it day and night Finally losing it because of someone else's fault - Do you know how it feels? - Yes I know the sharp stab of that pain more than you or everyone here 'This is not just about communication satellite alone' If I tell you straight you can't understand It's about our country You won't understand I can't transfer knowledge of Mihira to you 'We have no other option' You may think I'm selfish or foolish or anything else But I must go If the tarnished pride of our space centre ...should raise its head again I have to go I understood - Do as you wish - Adhi!

They are not on a circular orbit - They are in elliptical orbit - What? - Then correct the path at once - Insufficient time Path correction will take minimum 40 minutes 1st we have to fix Mihira - Karan, check Mihira's path - Yeah We will be closest to Mihira in the next 15 minutes After reaching we have 2 minutes 50 seconds of sync travelling After that, the distance between the 2 orbits will keep increasing and- Then Mihira will drift farther from us Your orbit at the moment is not on its circular path It is on an elliptical path Only for 2 minutes 50 seconds you will be closest to Mihira 'Afterwards the distance between Mihira's orbit and your orbit '...will keep increasing' Can't we get closer after half rotation? Karan, now Mihira is heading towards our communication satellite IMS-1 ...at a speed of 2000 kmph 'If not fixed immediately...' '...in 20 minutes the 2 satellites will collide' Karan, this is not the time to worry Dev, what do you suggest? Let's do this 'What does that mean?' 'How can we fix it in 2 minutes 50 seconds' - We are approaching Mihira - 'Copy' Mihira is 40° to our left We are closing in 1 minute 'Copy that' 'Opening hatch to Service modules' 'Copy' 'Preparing for extravehicular activity' Riya, outside temperature is fluctuating from -200°C to -150°C - Careful - 'Copy' 'Entering service module's outer chamber' Good Now you're at the closest point 'Copy' '- Opening the hatch - Copy' 'Mihira satellite in sight' 'Approaching' '- 50 meters - Copy' Sanjay, configure Mihira's short range connection for signal reception I'm coming up on that now 2, 1, mark '30 meters' 'Copy' 'Code running' '20 meters' 'Copy' - Captured...! - 'Copy' 60 seconds '- Confirming the position - Confirmed' Satellite is stable 'Copy' 'Target path is clear' '- I'm changing the panel - Copy' Riya, 45 seconds Copy 'Riya, your path has deviated by 10°' Pitching towards satellite 'Copy' '- Recaptured...! - Copy' 'Opening the panel' 'Copy' 'Checking slot' '25 seconds' - Riya, insert card to 2nd slot - Copy Come on 'Confirm data reception' That's negative Data not visible 'Rechecking' 'Request for reboot' 'Riya, you have only 10 seconds' 'We are deviating Riya, quick' 'I have to change the slot That's what I am trying' 'Jatayu 1 to Ground control' 'We failed to upgrade Mihira' - Dev - Riya, calm down It's okay Don't delve on what you could not do Think only about what is doable Slot didn't work which I inserted now I had to insert into another slot but- Power panel was behind the satellite In another 12 minutes Mihira will enter into IMS-1 orbit And within 2 minutes 20 seconds collision is unavoidable You got a call from Chinese Space Director 'This is from the Chinese Space Centre' 'We saw a failure in your attempt' 'We have to initiate the missile launch' We still have another chance We are going to make the 2nd attempt! 'It's impossible!' 'You cannot do it in less than 2 minutes' I'm telling you again India is not going to lose this Sanjay - Increase speed towards Mihira - Okay What is he doing? 'Riya, how long will it take to reach?' '4 minutes 24 seconds' 'What is the time left to maintain path's same distance?' 'Jatayu speed is very high' 'So this time just 1 minute 45 seconds' 'Means 65 seconds less than our last attempt' I'm really sorry Next maneuvering ...I won't miss it Not you We...! 'Karan, I'll change the settings and reboot' You execute after the link-up Why are you telling me? 'Dev...?' What the hell! 'Dev, careful' - Use thrusters - Copy - You check the deviation - Yes First it has to stabilize After that maneuver Take me as the reference point - Adjust your maneuvering - Copy '1 minute 36 seconds' 'Copy' Dev, don't panic 'You are in control' 'Just focus' 'Dev, careful' My God! Dev, watch it! Take the support of the edges 'I need something to hold on' 'Dev!' 'That's it!' Now hold and move 'I'm detaching the cable' Careful What is he doing? Why is he detaching the cable? He needs to go to the back of the satellite Distance is more That's why Update the time please '80 seconds' '70 seconds' 'Opening the panel' 'Copy' 'Inserting Comscard' 'Checking the slot' '- Turning on power panel - Copy' '38 seconds' 'Replacing card module A1 with C' System is ready to reactivate 'Confirmed' Karan, reboot 'Copy' '10 seconds' '5 seconds' 'Initiated' Mihira is upgraded and fully functional Inform all the Space Centre directors Mihira is moving in a vacant orbit 'Dev, IMS-1 is still in the collision course' 'You are bound to receive an impact' Dev, oh my! 'Careful, Dev' 'Dev, your cable has got detached' 'Hold me immediately' Yes, I am coming 'Dev, focus' 'Come tangentially to me' 'Take my coordinate and come' 'Come as accurately as you can' - Yeah, I am coming - 'Dev, just listen to me' '- Can you see my visual? - Yes, I can see you' 'Riya, I'm unable to control it' 'You are just 10 meters away' I am trying You are drifting 'Take the help of booster, Dev' 'Okay' 'Dev, you are just 10 meters away' 'Dev, almost there' 'Holding' 'Well done, Riya' 'Good job, Dev' Jatayu 1 to Ground control Dev and Riya have reached the command module safely Setting on course with trajectory correction 'Copy We are proud of you' 'Correcting the trajectory path I'll execute the mission as planned' 'Yeah' 'Even our 2 day mission in space should be successful' 'I am wondering when I'll see my daughter' 'You'll see her soon' 'Her name is Kinnera, right?' 'She must be waiting eagerly to see you' Coffee? No, it's all right - Sir? - Okay 'Dev, you called me?' - These are Viprayaan files? - Yes We must fix Viprayaan and retrieve its data - How can we do it? - I have a plan I need your help Viprayaan was 5 years ago Why rake it up? Listen, Mohan I have to do this If I have your support I can do a good job And you owe me this! You'll do it even if I don't support you Power supply will be less in a space flight, what will you do? Why are the program alarms beeping? Mohan? Er...could be a power issue Please check once Jatayu 1, we notice a power issue 'Report status' 'Copy' 'Low power warning' 'Copy' How is it possible? Riya, check 'Whatever is happening is not good' 'Flight guidance' 'Alarms keep beeping' Abort further stay and return - Copy - Sir We need power to return and it is dangerously low Sir, he is correct ISS is nearby to dock for power back up 'It's impossible' 'ISS is moving at a speed of 28100 kmph' 'We are only at 7000 kmph speed' 'We can't catch that speed to dock from behind' 'If we try to dock from front we'll be on a collision course' Sir, we can do it by vertical trajectory shift mechanism - Vertical trajectory shift? - Yeah Yes, let's do it vertically Taking a 90 degrees rotation... ...dock when the 2 positions sync - Yeah - It's too dangerous Is it more dangerous than dying here without power? Let's do it Okay, fix it - Connect them to ISS - Okay, sir 'Jatayu, this is Ground control Permission granted '- You may connect to ISS - Copy' 'Do or die situation, Sanjay' 'Even if dock position changes by 1° we'll be stuck in space' '- Focus, we are not dying in space' - I am on it' We are docked No noticeable oscillations 'Everything smooth' Inform me after back up Why are the meter readings not changing? We still have a problem Actually we have no problem - What? - Yes We never had a problem We are going there! Mohan? You knew about this earlier, right? Why are you looking at me? No way, Sanjay I haven't been trained for this Even I don't think this is right, Dev Is this a share auto to ask the driver to stop wherever you fancy? We are not ready for this Dev, your proposal will not be honored by Space Centre - This is very dangerous - Dev, listen Flight controllers follow an important rule If you don't know what to do don't do it, period! You have to convince him Dev, your plan won't work I will tell you what the hell we are doing when it happens - Riya, pass the water packet - What? Riya, give me the water packet Lunar trajectory has steps to be performed manually 1st step is to move out of the earth's orbit And next few steps 'To adjust to the moon's path' And the final 2 steps To enter the lunar orbit Whatever we consider as rocket science is truly rocket science indeed But we studied and absorbed facts only to face challenges Not to take the easy way out and escape If we don't fix Viprayaan now... ...it will be ruined soon trapped in moon's gravity 'This is our one and only opportunity' Come what may I intend fixing Viprayaan I'll return to earth only after collecting its data In this matter ...nobody can bloody stop me Thank you, sir I really appreciate your support from ISS - Yes, Kunal? - Sir - Back up over? - Sir, Dev wants to go into moon's orbit Tell him we'll plan next year Sir, actually we never had a power issue 'It's a fake program He has other intentions' Does he think this is a fairy tale? 'Our only goal now is Viprayaan satellite' 'We are retrieving it at any cost' Did he say Viprayaan? Is he mad or what? I should have realized this earlier Turn on the speaker Dev, this is the 1st and last warning! Abort the mission and return immediately Why are you being childish? We are not equipped for this We need a lot more resources to accomplish your plan 'All of us will be in trouble' Nobody knows that route and procedure Riya, knowing the problem is solving it 90% 'Balance only 10% is the execution' Viprayaan is our nation's pride Don't we have concern over a satellite sent from our Telugu motherland? How can we abandon it in that quiet and dark space? Dev, Viprayaan is dead It is no longer important 'It is enough if we understand our limits and follow instructions' 'That is our nation's pride' Sir, Viprayaan is not a dead object 'Our excellence lies in pushing our limits' If you were part of an administrative team ...and writing only parts of a rocket would you be Mission Control director? Sir, if I really had an option... I won't be taking this step Being detached and disinterested is... ...not an option sir - Escapism! - Dev Stop arguing and return at once 'If we don't retrieve Viprayaan now...' ...we will never be able to do so If we can't fix, even after our neighboring country finds it... ...we will be condemned in the history of future generations We are the best team with the best flight in ground crew If we are determined we can make this happen 'Sanjay, abort the mission and return' Viprayaan gave Indian Space Centre an identity in the world 'Now that's at stake' Sanjay, abort the mission 'That's my final order' There won't be any further discussions on this If you support me in this issue, we can restore the pride of our Space Centre 'Dev, you are out of your mind' We are not plants to stay stationary 'We are astronauts' If we lose face in world's eyes... ...how can we proclaim our victory? Then how will we hold our head high? Instead of feeling proud like every Indian looking at our flag... I don't like to bow my head in shame We believed in ourselves and we ascended so far into space But why shouldn't we take another step further? Sir I don't have a strong reason to disapprove of this Oh God! We are wasting so much of our time 'There is no route to take us to Viprayaan' We need to focus only on what is under our control 'Dev, listen, so far we have never sent any human beyond our earth's orbit' We don't even know whether we can compute a lunar injection maneuver 'We have to match the orbit speed of Viprayaan accurately' 'Supposing it is matched when nearing Viprayaan...' '...you can be caught in the moon's gravitational force and never return' Highly dangerous Not just 1 or 2 You'll face countless problems Sir, you have pointed out all the problems We studied and achieved so much We have come this far Can't we solve that by brainstorming for an hour? Sir, NASA has 36% Indian scientists 'Success rate amongst them is 90%' Can't we add the 10% required effort? We don't even know if this can be done by boosters' guidance or not Convert to auto pilot and bring them back Okay, sir For the sake of personal pride ...you're sacrificing the integrity of our Space Centre Sir, Dev has executed some program I'm unable to override 'Hey idiot! If any problem crops up, you'll be caught in the moon's orbit' You can't come out In that case, we'll be the 1st citizens on the moon! Dev, this is not possible Too many risks involved Risk? There isn't even a calculated risk, Riya Exactly...life is beyond calculations After coming here, I understood how much we don't know 'How did we live this long without knowing anything!' If we die, it's our fate We have to accept it If anything happens to us, there won't be delay in the next step, progress is assured 'We have to take back Viprayaan's data' Riya There are 3 types of people in this world '1st type don't know what to accomplish' 2nd type want to do something somehow '3rd, accomplish at any cost' Between aspiration and achievement... ...effort is the only existing distance After having come this far ...is it correct to step back? Not correct, Dev I can't believe myself I feel I should support you in this What? Don't you envisage any problem in this? Only problem I can anticipate is... ...we have to spend extra 2 days in space! Food may or may not be sufficient What mad plan is this, huh? Even in extreme emergency levels we ensure minimum safety measure You want to go to the moon without minimum planning? We will merge with darkness One needs darkness to see some bright spots! If we plan, only the process gets done Not miracles Listen, Dev If we go back to earth now we will be hailed as heroes We go by your plan even our bodies won't be found! Smallest mistake, we are out! You may not have anyone, Dev But we have families waiting for us Suppose we die? 'Allow visitors' Daddy Hi daddy Mummy, look Nana 'Daddy' Kinnera...hey! How are you, nana? My daughter...Kinnera Listen, daddy They are saying you won't come home on Monday Tell me, nana Remember, the other day when you refused to eat, what did I promise you? The moon! If I have to get the moon for you shouldn't I go there? Daddy is going up to the moon They don't know its value, dear They'll take it if they know But if you go near the moon... ...this uncle says you may fall down So he says you may not come back What do you think, Kinnu? My nana is a super hero! He'll bring me the moon definitely True, uncle I love my daddy more than this world After bringing the moon back for me ...he'll comb my hair daily for me He'll pack my lunch box for me He'll drop me at school He'll read many stories to me at bedtime Mummy told me Right, daddy? Won't you be back? Yes, Kinnu Whatever happens, whatever people may say, daddy will go near the moon I'll complete the mission and return in 4 days After I get back home... ...I'll make you and the entire nation proud I promise you, Kinnu Daddy is a super hero That means, tonight I'll also see you from here 'By the side of the moon' I'll see you too from up here, moppet Take care, daddy Bye bye I love you Bye, Kinnu I love you Just like your plan my tears don't hold back either 1st time, my daughter has wished for something Moon! For 1 daughter this is the 1st request For another daughter '...this was her last request!' Slogged day and night 'Took many tough decisions' Solved many problems Enough of applauding other countries 'Now it's our turn' For this mission to succeed Follow my orders 'If anything goes wrong...' Whatever issues arise ...I'll take up the entire responsibility Okay, all flight controllers Listen now In Indian history We will achieve something for the first time We are reaching the moon Dev, from now on consult me before taking any decision And override automatic control 'Yes, sir' Today is the day We will be heading towards the moon at a speed of 7000 kmph today And the name of our mission Mission Kinnera "Journey through space to transcend Mind struggles within unaware of the end" "Journey through space to transcend Mind tussles within unaware of the end" "In the vast space ahead endless In the heart an unsettled distress" "Searching for an unknown bond A journey into an empty sea and beyond" "A journey into an empty sea and the unknown" "Journey through space to transcend" "Journey through space to ascend" "Journey through space to spearhead" "Journey through space to forge ahead" "Eternal sky clashing for generations with man's efforts and expectations" "At the tip of the sky's finger questions as star-lit festoons glitter" "The glow on the moon mocks with a smile for moon being called 'cool' all this while" "Why this warfare against space?" "When did this debt of gratitude surface?" "Unaware of this secret our heartbeat won't rest" "Journey through space to transcend Mind struggles within unaware of the end" "Mind tussles within unaware of the end" "Journey through space to ascend" "Journey through space to spearhead" They call this 'food', huh? Dev, I'm really sorry You faced so much loss in your life because of me I feel scared and worried at the same time Why rake up the past now? If you are wrong in ignoring my commands when you are tense ...then I am to be blamed too for allowing Paru to come with me We should not be thinking of that now I need your support on this We won't get a chance to set back the clock and set things right We have that golden chance for Viprayaan Only opportunity to rectify both our mistakes I need you by my side If you support me, we can achieve our goal together It's our baby After this burn they must take a sleep break Guys, you need some sleep Sleep? I don't have that kind of luxury 'I won't sleep' 'Till this mission is accomplished I just cannot sleep' Right from childhood he's like this He won't sleep till he ticks his wish list! His stubborn nature sticks to him even in space! Tell them we are not losing them They must catch up on some sleep Hey! Good to see you Want to talk to Karan? I'm so proud he has gone that far How much longer should the engines burn? Till they reach moon's gravity Around 7 hours 40 minutes? 7 hours 40- Any of you need a break right now? If they don't sleep we won't sleep either Viprayaan's speed around the moon is 805 kmph 'To reach Viprayaan' '...we must travel in the closest orbit with a matching velocity' We get a 3 minute consistency at the spot where both orbits match We should maneuver in that time frame and retrieve data from Viprayaan What are the challenges? We must figure out the speed match point If mismatched we will have to rotate once more Besides power and time issues ...any disturbance in extra rotation ...we will be pulled into the moon's gravity So theoretically, Viprayaan moves only at 778 feet per second 'And according to your calculation' ...if we use 305 seconds specific impulse with 5 kg thrusters 1016 kg propellant should be given Yes If we have to reach Viprayaan at that specified time ...we must travel at a speed of 9000 kmph 9000 kmph? Impossible Jatayu 1 has not been designed for that And theoretically we lose control over the flight Karan, if we don't go at that speed we will miss Viprayaan If our mission should succeed we need 2 mid-course corrections 1st is the exact spot the velocities match And the specific time to initiate it And to get that exact time we should travel at the speed of... 9000 kmph '7500' '7700' '7900' '8000' '8200' '8400' '8500' '8600' '8700' '8800' '8900' '9000!' 'Congratulations!' 'Jatayu is moving at 9000 kmph' 'Ground control' 'Ground control, we have a problem' - What happened? - Sanjay, not getting Jatayu's visuals 'We have a Bus B under volt' What is the airlock status? Red indicated on the port panels We are checking I need the report a.s.a.p, send it Is it main Bus B? Yes 'Computers are restarting' I'll reconfigure the terminal - What happened? - Service module is impacted Open the log files of service modules Sir, we have a serious problem Service module hatch has opened 'Line up the visitors' What's the data telling you now? Power units' readings not showing, sir - Check manually - Sir They have only 60 hours of power back up, sir Listen You will take 25 minutes to go up to Viprayaan Then you need 72 hours to travel back to earth 'Understand? You have only 60 hours of power supply' 'Service modules are all burnt' 'Your exit is closed' 'If the hatch is opened command module will blast' 'Attempt a sling shot from lunar orbit Return to earth before oxygen depletes' Dev...? We are very close to Viprayaan We almost reached it Dev...Dev, we tried We are all very proud of you Please return immediately 'Our exit option is closed' 'Prepare to bring them back' Dev, I'm sorry I'm switching on to auto pilot There's a way to check if they can go out or not Must check if service module or outer chamber is burnt Just give me a minute Karan, open temperature and pressure panels Values are almost steady Fluctuating near 30° range Good, so it means the chamber connecting the service module isn't burnt, it's safe It can serve as your exit Adhi, it is an analog system What if the indicator gets stuck? Okay, open service module log once 'Likewise turn on the power input to BUS B' 'Any changes in the log file readings?' No 'Increase input voltage Same power to BUS C' - Shows the same 30° - Fantastic! Chamber connecting service module and command module isn't burnt, it is safe 'They can exit from there' 'Adithya, in case your procedure is wrong' '...we will lose all of them' 'Sir, trust me, it works' I trust you guys Other than main application turn off rest of the power 'Ground control' 'Main applications power restored' 'When I was a kid I never ate unless I saw the moon' 'But now when I'm nearing the moon this food just isn't enough!' 'We are entering the lunar sphere of influence' 'Congratulations!' 'We are now under moon's gravitational pull' Copy Dev, keep this in mind 'If you decide on a slingshot maintain current orbital distance' Viprayaan is now at 806 kmph 'Your flight speed is low now' That means you will have only 8 minutes If you take longer... ...we cannot bring you back! You are on suicidal 'Copy, sir' 'We are almost there' Karan This plan has to work come what may You have oxygen supply only for 7 and 1/2 minutes Don't wait for me, as soon as you receive the data attempt a slingshot 'Waiting for EVA permission for Dev' Dev, you are in Director has permitted extra vehicular activity to capture Viprayaan 'Okay...we are good to go' Okay Dev...? Go safely Not 'Go safely' Say, 'Come back safe' When we travel under the moon's shadow '...it is said the stars shine 10 times more beautiful than seen from our earth' Maybe it will look more beautiful than Tilak's 'The Nectarous Night'! Waiting eagerly to see it - Check your signal frequently, Dev - 'Yes, Sanjay, copy' Good luck, Dev I am checking the signals You are very close to the moon We are working on it, Mohan Just hold on Copy 'When we go behind the moon, you will lose signal for few seconds' Copy '60 seconds' 'You will hear what we speak only after 60 seconds' Copy Remember we are not going to lose you guys 'We have moved farther from Viprayaan' What...? I don't think so System shows it Are we maintaining that distance? Dev, control your breath You are tethered Cable is stuck Not enough to reach Viprayaan 'This is the maximum limit' No, Sanjay Maneuver it closer You can't get closer than this, Dev Then how will Dev reach Viprayaan? Cable is attached to him This plan isn't feasible - I must go for plan B - 'What other plan?' What? We have a serious situation Dev has detached the cable and attempted the slingshot 'You can't get closer than this, Dev' 'Then how will Dev reach Viprayaan?' 'Cable is attached to him' 'This plan isn't feasible' '- I must go for plan B - What other plan?' What other plan? Don't know, sir 'Dev, do you copy?' I repeat, Dev, do you copy? Give me your position, Dev 'Can you see us?' 'Dev, do you copy?' 'Repeat, do you copy?' 'We lost your position, Dev' Give me your position Dev, respond Dev, report 'Give me your position, Dev' 'Can you see us?' 'Dev, do you copy?' 'I repeat, Dev, do you copy?' 'We have lost your visual' 'Your suit is getting depressurized' 'We have only 4 minutes for slingshot' 'Do you copy?' I am on mark We got to go...go...go Come on I have just reached Viprayaan Riya, antenna orientation has to be set Dev, we have 3 minutes and 40 seconds After that we need to get the hell out of here Copy that Riya, do you copy? - Opening the power panel door - 'Copy' When you read system signals, you can view Viprayaan's data, confirm it Not receiving data 'IMU is up' Copy that - Uplink telemetry to axiom - 'Copy' Is it being processed? Data reception confirmed Yes, we did it! 'Data transmission has stopped' What...? Not getting data? 'It is negative Not receiving signals' Dev, we have 2 minutes 30 seconds to get out of there Quick! 'Data is loading' Dev, your oxygen level is very, very low 'Why are you using back up power from jet propulsion?' 'Oxygen in your suit will deplete in a second, don't do it, Dev' 'Data loading interrupted, Dev' 'It is working Receiving data' 'Come back, Dev' What is the status? '20%' 'Dev, you come back' Dev...? Dev, data is getting transmitted You have to come '60%' '70%' Tell me when data is 100% transferred 'Dev, your oxygen level is dangerously low' '90%...' 'Dev, come back' '100%' Dev, come back We have incoming data We have incoming data! 'Give me your position' 'Report, Dev' Control your breathing Dev, do you copy? Turn on your light Please, Dev Yes...yes, I copy 'Turn on your light' I will Turned it on Can you see it? 'No, still no visual' I am waving the torch Confirm if you can see Confirm the visual Dev, what happened? Where are you? Confirm visual Negative, no visual 'Dev, your suit has only 5% oxygen' Dev, you are inaudible 'You're inhaling CO2 now' 'Control your breathing' Dev is drifting away Communication is totally cut Dev...please Dev, please Sanjay, do you copy? Negative, there is no confirmation - They are coming back, sir - Okay - Go ahead with retrofire - Yes, sir Retro booster 1 Fired Autopilot is on We are up for the slingshot Dev hasn't come We have to stop - We have to stop - Ground control, we lost Dev I repeat we lost Dev Stop slingshot If it takes them 1 minute to receive our message, same for us too Total 2 minutes We can't stop this Entire control is from the ground 'Retro booster 2' Retro booster 3 Fired All fired 'Ground control' 'We lost Dev I repeat we lost Dev' 'Stop slingshot' 'I repeat we lost Dev' 'Stop slingshot' Whaaat...? Dev hasn't come back? Sir, we can't do anything now 'After retrofire if we override manually' '...Jatayu will go out of control!' For having fixed Viprayaan... ...Dev will feel very proud Yeah Sanjay Do you see the chamber's temperature and pressure values are changing? Dev 'De-pressure the suit' 'Karan, check the oxygen values' 'Hurry up!' 'Riya, fill the oxygen tank' 'We are losing Dev, quick!' 'Riya, I'm talking to you' 'Oxygen, quick' 'Dev' 'We are not losing you' Dev Dev...? Dev 'Dev, you did it' 'You did it!' 'Ground control, we have Dev' 'I repeat we have Dev' 'Ground control, we have Dev' 'I repeat we have Dev' We have him We have him! Everybody on board Mission Kinnera accomplished! Okay...okay, guys Congratulations to you all! You guys are awesome Now relax Relax...relax 'Ladies and gentlemen' 'An enormous lava tube has been found in the Marius Hill region of the moon' 'It could offer a readymade shielded site' 'Within which human structures can be built' 'We concluded this could've happened due to a blow-out from a volcano in the moon' 'In case this hypothesis is proved to be true...' '...then definitely' '...there will be water molecules on moon' 'And as a result' '...human inhabitation is likely over there!' 'Space centres have chosen Mars to be the centre for research' 'To conduct tests on Mars...' '...journey will take 300 days!' 'But if it is moon...' '...we can go in just 3 days!' 'That will be the next mission of Indian space centre' 'In another 3 years...' '...India's mission to send people to the moon will be accomplished' 'So, friends...' '...Viprayaan is undoubtedly a wonder' 'And a pride of India!' - Nana! - Kinnu - Daddy, did you bring me the moon? - Couldn't bring it If you study well you can go there one day Thanks, bro You made it happen What does it matter you or me? We are proud of you both In the next mission try to send both of us Okay, we'll see "Mother earth! We flew into space with courage and conviction in place" "Mother, we descended safe in your warm embrace" "If you can't believe me so easily ask that silver moon above you see" "If she witnessed our Mission Kinnera ask her to endorse; it isn't a chimera" subtitled by rekhs assisted by gowri, harini, krish&venky "Though we beckoned the moon above she was unwilling to leave her abode" "Fine, we decided we'll meet her in the infinite space yonder" "We went on a royal mission to space" "Garlanded by lightning flashes" "The eternal sky in wonderment rejoiced with joyful enjoyment" "Will the distance never decrease between borderless skies & boundless seas?" "Did this thought-wave follow in our heart and mind to ebb and flow?" "Won't it be a bridge to space to bridge the gap always?" "If you travel to the world's end with unshakeable faith as your friend" "Clear as crystal you can see Your dream come true in reality"
