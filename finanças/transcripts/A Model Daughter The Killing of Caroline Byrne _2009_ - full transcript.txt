... Sydney, the game of rugby league, your game, has been hijacked by the Mexicans. Yeah, you know who they are. While footy fans here in Punchbowl, Manly, Penrith, and Sharksville, Cronulla, are fast asleep the crow eaters and the bloody Vics are likely to be ... Bastard's in our spot. How bloody rude. I mean, what will they call them? Another million brain cells bites the dust. Oh yeah, got a few billion to spare then, eh? What was that? Probably some drunk Sheila from the pub, I suppose. True. Caroline! Caroline, where are you? Have you seen a girl? She's skinny, long blonde hair? Mate, heard a scream a while back. Yeah. Could have been a girl. Oh, Jesus. Oh Jesus, she's done it. She's done it. Caroline! Hello? Gordon? I don't know what's happened... Is that you? Gordon? -What are you saying? -What's wrong? Something has happened to Caroline! Gordon, slow down. Her car is here, Tony. I think she's taken her own life. Ah, just wait there. Wait there, and I'm going to come and collect you, okay? -Hop in. -What's happened, Gordon? You've found her car at The Gap? Yeah. Yeah, yes. When did you last see her? Ah, lunchtime. I came home to take her out to lunch, but she ... she was sick in bed, so I got my own lunch. She was supposed to be working out at Parklea today. Yeah, she was sick in bed. I told you. Gordon, how did you know where to find her? I don't know. I just... I had a feeling. What does that mean? Why would her car be at The Gap? You had an argument. -You had an argument. -No, no! I love you. I love you. You're... you're my father. I love you. Must have been here for hours. Where the hell is she? - Caroline! - Maybe she left a clue. That's her wallet, mate. Check it. Come on! Caroline! Caroline! Caroline! Caroline! Caroline! Caroline! No luck, mate? You haven't seen a blonde woman come this way? Told your friend we heard a loud female voice earlier. Yeah, thought it was a drunk. Which direction? Can we borrow your torch? Yeah. Battery's a bit flat. Sorry, mate. This woman. What did she sound like? High pitched. Laughter. Or screaming, you know. Yeah, screaming. Yeah, yeah... screaming. Caroline! Caroline! Caroline! Hey! Caroline! Caroline! She knows this place. She could be here. Why on earth would she be here? Dad, go back to the truck. Please. Peter! Get over here. We've got to keep looking! Tony! Look at this. The next Elle MacPherson. Caroline! Pete! Pete, can you see that? What? Looks like it could be something. I can't see anything. No, it looks like it could be legs and a body. Where? I can't see a bloody thing. -We're going to the police. -We have to keep looking. She could be out there, somewhere. Dad, what if she's injured? We're going to the police. Mum, it's Gordy. I'm... I'm sorry to wake you at such an ungodly hour. I have some bad news. We're almost ready to go. I don't want anyone to... I want all this, kept confidential. Why didn't she go to work today? She was... she was depressed. She'd been to the doctor's... Depressed? Yeah, she was supposed to see a psychiatrist. -What? -Bullshit, Gordon. Look at that. Look at that. That is a referral from her doctor to a psychiatrist. That is dated last Monday. I don't believe it. I don't believe Caroline took her own life. Tony, listen to me. She jumped. She was in your care. One, two, three, four! Right! Left! Now you're getting! One, two, three, four! Right! Left! Easy walk. And again. Forward. Caroline! How are you, Caroline? Everybody, say a big hello to Caroline. - Hi, Caroline! - Sorry we're late, Gordon. Just show us your easy walk, Caroline. What do you think? Loves himself. And, forward. Lift the knee. Lift the knee, Caroline. Come on, smile, people. Come on! That's the way. Forward. Very pleased to meet you, Gordon. It's an absolute pleasure, Tony. Caroline has told me so much about you. I feel like, you're my own father. Come on through. -Oh, please. -Thank you. Thank you. -Hi, I'm Gordon. -Deanna. Lovely to meet you, Deanna. He's way too good looking. Too buffed. You're just jealous. You sure he's not gay? He's asked me to move in with him. He seems, fairly confident. Ambitious. He's only teaching aerobics while he builds up his share portfolio. He's got big plans. He's going to be the next Rene Rivkin. As long as he makes you happy. Do you think Mum would have liked him? Absolutely. So, you glad you moved in? So, you've found yourself another bloke. Look, it's... in a really traumatically, you know... I have to make some changes. I'm being pulled in different directions. I always thought we'd get married one day. Have kids. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Andrew. What'd you do to upset her? Nothing. Everything was fine. It was normal. We even had a bath together. A bath? Gordon, we're not doing any good here. Can you take us home? Yeah, sure. Sure. I'll tell you if they find anything, okay? Back off! Wilson, tell 'em to back off! Can't see a thing. Roger that. Backing off. There's too many cops, man. Let's get out of here. That him? There she is! That's what she was wearing! -What's he looking at? -Beats me. I can't see a thing. Bloody hell. Okay, I'm going down. Chuck us the rope, boys. He's the man everyone wants to be. Your desire for wealth or the thrill of the chase, beating the market at its own game. He's the man with a modest touch... Rivkin's a gambler, pure and simple. Australia's highest profile stockbroker is never seen without a cigar clamped... Mercurial, capricious, Rene Rivkin lives life in the fast lane, literally. Among his fleet of cars is a Bentley and a simple Ferrari... His guests retreated to a dinner fit for an emperor... Some people call me a power junkie and so on and so forth, and I confess, I enjoy having people at my beck and call. What's the point of being rich if you can't have some lackeys? Kerry, my dear. You pay me an exorbitant amount of money to give you good advice. So why don't you take it? Mr. Rivkin? Gordon Wood's my name. It would be an absolute pleasure to buy you a cup of coffee. And what do you expect in return? Absolutely nothing. We're in the same game, you and I. And what game would that be? Investment and consulting. Although I'm not in the same league as you, of course. Why don't you fuck off, ya piece of shit? Stop bothering the man. Gary, thank you. Gordon, you say? -Yes. -Why don't you sit down, Gordon, and tell me all about yourself? You have precisely 60 seconds. He lets you drive his Bentley whenever you want? Well mostly I'm supposed to drive him around but sure. Why not? I feel like Lady Muck! Well you should try out the back. This is our future, Caroline. Promise? Yes? Oh, no! She was where you thought. Jesus! They found her. Where Gordon said he could see legs and body. When you went back to the truck, Gordon said he thought he could see legs and a body. Could you? No. It was pitch black. Then, how on Earth, could he? Gordon, what happened? Caroline... Oh, Oh, no. -Oh, you poor love. -I'm okay, Mum. No, you're not. Oh, love. Oh, love. Oh, my love. Oh, poor love! Craig Woods. Good to meet you. Why don't you tell me what happened, Mr. Woods? Wood. Wood. You're Woods. We're... Wood. Sorry. When did you first realize that Caroline was missing, Mr. Wood? I came home from work at about 6. This is last night. She wasn't at home, even though she'd been at home all day sick in bed. But I thought that she... she was feeling better, or she'd probably gone round to visit a friend. So, I, turned on the TV and watched the news and I fell asleep. And when did you wake up? After midnight. And what did you do then? I borrowed a friend's truck and drove around looking for a Suzuki, and I ended up at the Gap. And what made you think of the Gap? We used to go there sometimes. I just... I had a feeling. I'll have to ID the body, won't I? Unless her family can do it. She's my responsibility. We had to mask her face because of the damage. Do you understand? I can only show you her hand. I'm sorry. I... I can't remember. Can I call you back? Constable Craig Woods. Thank you. They want me to get the name of the dentist. I made a statement to the police and went to the morgue. There's not much more we can do for now. You know, she was supposed to... come over here for dinner last night. Peter and I left messages at her apartment in the afternoon, tried her on the mobile. It was switched off. So was yours. Didn't you get them? When I got home about six. Why didn't you ring me? I was going to. After the news, I fell asleep. Where'd you think she was? With you. Why didn't you ring me when you woke up? I knew something bad had happened. I borrowed a car and I came around here to see if her car was parked outside and it wasn't, so, I went looking for her. She always parks underneath in the security car park. You know that. But you drove straight to the Gap. I just... -had a feeling. -If you thought there was something wrong, why didn't you ring me? Because there was no need, okay? Everything was fine. Everything was... everything was normal. But you immediately assume that she's taken her own life. Thank you. That was the morgue. Do we want to collect her personal items? Yes, we do. Hello, Peter Byrne speaking. Yeah, I'm her brother. You need to sign here for Miss Byrne's personal effects. Do you mind if I look at her tits? A police officer needs to be present for an examination or a social worker. Don't worry about it then. You want me to tell you what I think really happened? I think you were there. Arguing with her, yes? Then, for whatever reason, she throws herself off the cliff and you're left feeling Ike it's all your fault, that you'll get the blame. That's why you told the police that cock and bull story about falling asleep in front of the TV, and so on and so forth. I've decided to tell people that it was a hit and run. Why do that? I don't anyone thinking that she... That she was mentally ill. I loved her, Rene. I loved her. My girlfriend was killed by a car last night. The fire at the Offset Alpine Printing Factory is believed to have been started by a Christmas... Rene owns a big chunk of the place. Since when has Rivkin been interested in the printing industry? He's not. He doesn't know the first thing about it, but he does love a big fat juicy profit. What do you mean? Gordy, stop being so smug. Gordon, no one cares. Well, Rene never gets into anything unless he smells a buck, right? I happen to know that the Offset Alpine Printing Group was insured about a month ago for a cool 50 mill. What'd he pay for it? About fifteen, I think. You're suggesting the fire was deliberately lit? All I'm saying is, if you've got some spare cash, I'd buy a few shares. You should think about it, Tony. Sounds a bit fishy to me. Oh, Rene's no crook. He's just a smart operator. Okay, well how about you loan me the money and let me take the risk. Gordy. Drop it. We shouldn't be talking business on Christmas Day. When the market finds out what this place is worth, the share price will go through the roof. Dad? Gordon's here again. Tony, you should know that she was depressed about her job. She was excited about it. She told me that Monday. I don't think that she wanted to worry you. She told me that she loved teaching deportment at June Dally's, but that she missed modeling, so she was going to try to do both. She was excited. I don't think that she ever got over the death of her mum. Rene's going to give you a hundred thousand dollars? No strings? Provided you loan us the balance, and both of you have to approve the property. I'd have to be sole mortgagee to protect my investment. Caroline's investment. I can't see any problem with that. Daddy, you're an angel! Thank you. Tony's agreed to fund us the balance as long as you put up the deposit. Mine is the only name on the contract, yes? I don't want him anywhere near the title documents. Of course. That's understood. Good. Oh, my giddy aunt! You told me one thing, you told him another. Well, it's not on, Gordon. -Tony, come on. -No, that's it. I'm out. Gone. Finito. It's only 270 grand. Why don't you go to the bank like any other young couple? If we don't make an offer today, we lose the apartment! I can't believe you don't care about your daughter's happiness. I can't believe Rene Rivkin expected to get his grubby fingers on the title deeds using my money! Dad? How did it happen? Doctor? How the hell did this happen? I'm so sorry. I was so shocked to hear... Look, we just... we're just trying to find out, how it happened, doctor. I mean, why? You must be terribly upset. Would you like me to organize counseling for you? No! No, I'm trying to work out how she could have done such a thing. Doctor, you saw her on Monday. You must have known what her state of mind was. She was suffering mild depression. She wasn't suicidal. But you referred her to a psychiatrist. I repeat, I don't believe she was suicidal. Why did you go straight to the Gap? I didn't. I went to Bondi first. And then Camp Cove, because we used to... go there sometimes. I stopped at the Gap on the way back because... You had this feeling. Because her spirit led me there, Pete. Gordon speaking. Gordon, it's Carel Clifford. The manager at June Dally's? Yes. Ah, of course. You said Caroline was sick when you rang the other night. That's right. How is she today? She won't be coming back. Ever? Why? Caroline was run over by a car the other night. God, that's terrible. Is she okay, or...? If you believe in heaven and hell, then she's in heaven now. Don't tell anyone. Just let them find out slowly. Narelle, it's Gordon. Bad news I'm afraid. Caroline was, hit by a car in Double Bay. She's... she's dead. I'm so sorry. I have some terrible news. Caroline was run over by a car in Bondi the other night. She's been in an accident. It was a hit and run in Rose Bay. She's dead. Deanna. What happened, daddy? I don't believe it. I just don't. Yes? Mr. Wood. June Dally-Watkins here. I was shocked and saddened to hear the news about Caroline. My sincere condolences. It was very, very tragic. Mr. Wood, I'm told you've been telling people she was run down by a car. I can tell you that my daughter, Lisa, who's a reporter, confirmed Caroline died following a fall from the Gap. May I suggest you start telling the truth? You're absolutely right. Miss Dally, I... I'm so sorry. The truth is, she was terribly stressed at work and it finally got the better of her. She had only been full time one week. She told her friends she was very happy about it. -What's more... -No, -Miss Dally... -Let me finish, please. She wrote a report for me, telling me how happy she was. Well she lied to you. She told me that. Did you know that she was suffering from a mental disease since birth? She was on medication, just like her mother. She had tried to commit suicide on numerous occasions that I know of and that she was actually really only very happy with me. So, this would have happened, if not now, then later. Can you imagine... Can you imagine, if she had a child, and we were married and it would have died too. I know you loved her as much as I did. Kylie, no one else understands what it's like to... to lose her. I know, Gordy. I know. What do I do? What do I do without her? I'll never forget going to the morgue to identify her body... Oh, no... I don't want to hear. Sorry. You're a good friend, Kylie. I'd like to think that I could call you whenever I need to talk to someone, about Caroline. You can. You can call me, Gordy. Do you know where the loos are? Caroline, this place is beautiful. Yeah, it's gorgeous. I'm so glad you guys like it. -Yeah. -Are you right for drinks? I might grab another one. Okay, cool. There's only one golden rule to remember if you're going to buy shares. Can I tempt you, Rene? You have to ask yourself, would I buy the whole company? You see? You see, you have to ... . Here she is, my beautiful, beautiful Caroline. No more cleaning. Let's just save it till the morning. He resents me, doesn't he? Rene? Would he have bought us this place if he resented you? Well we are paying him rent. He resents my father, I know that. Well that's because Tony double crossed him. He didn't. He was just protecting his financial interest. Okay, okay. Look, the way Rene sees it, he was hot to trot and then Tony pulled the plug at the last minute. Now we...hey, hey, we are so lucky that he decided to go ahead and buy anyway, and we are going to be so much more lucky when I get my Offset Alpine bonus. So, when do we formalize all this? Mrs. Gordon Wood? Hey, hey. What is your problem, Caroline? Just not yet. I'm too young. You can tell me when you grow up. I don't think you love me at all. Hi, Daddy. I can't stay. I've got to get home. Gordy's off to Zurich tonight. Zurich? With Rene? Of course, with Rene. He can't do without him. Do you know what the Australian Securities Commission is? "The ASC has frozen trade in the block of Swiss controlled Offset Alpine Printing Group shares." I don't know anything about it. They want to find out who benefits from the insurance payout when that joint burnt down. But the Swiss, being the secretive little devils, they are, won't bloody tell them. -Goodbye. -I reckon that I can save them the trouble. Your boyfriend's pal, Rene Rivkin! Rene the shonk! Rene the crook! I wrote this for you. Thanks. Come back safe. I will. Now you've heard of the packet of Tim Tams that never runs out? Well, I'm giving you the dessert that never runs out. And it is sweet and pure and full of goodness. That dessert is my passionate, undying deepest love for you. Dad? The funeral director is on the phone. ♪ Hold me in your memory ♪ ♪ Find me ♪ ♪ Find me in your dreams ♪ ♪ See me in little things ♪ ♪ Like Raven ♪ ♪ In the breeze ♪ ♪ And if you ♪ Thank you. - Water for the table, folks? - Please. Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? Do you remember seeing a blonde girl around here on Wednesday the 7th? This girl. She died here that night. The girl whose body they recovered? Just let me check with Craig. May I ask you a question. Sorry, Miss Dally? Of course, you can ask a question. That is, you are capable of asking it. The point at issue, is it permissible to ask, hence may I. Hi. Look, I do remember seeing her that afternoon. She was with two guys. Two men? Can you describe them? One was tall, fair haired guy with a brown suede jacket. He was athletic looking. The other one had a dark jacket and like a ponytail. Thank you. She was so drowsy, it wasn't natural. She never slept during the day. So, I checked the bathroom cabinet. I had five or six Rohypnol tablets. They were gone. And she admitted that she'd been taking a quarter every night. And that was about 1pm? And what did you do then? Go back to work? No, I rang a mate, Brett Cochrane. Arranged to meet him at Ditto's Café in Victoria Road. Brett Cochrane? The photographer. On the Kangaroo tour? Brett? Then I got a call from my boss, Rene. He wanted me to pick up his lunch guests and take him back to the office, so I had to go. Then I came back home at six. You know the rest. Two witnesses saw Caroline here in Watsons Bay Park that afternoon. She was with two male persons. One of them matches your description. Well I wasn't with her then. Had you and Caroline been in this area around that time? No. No, we... we'd been here once together for a Sunday walk in our entire lives. That was a year ago. Never mind where he was during the day. Where was he that night? Do you have any evidence he wasn't at home asleep? No. But pounds to peanuts he was with Caroline. I think he murdered her. Sir, I know it's hard to accept. My conclusion is that she was depressed, went to the Gap on her own and took her own life. Gordon, this is lovely, but I can't accept it. It would mean a lot to me. It feels kind of wrong, you know? It would mean a lot to Caroline, too. Gordon, are you sure? It is lovely. Whenever you look at the time, you'll think of her, and me. Because I'll be thinking of you. As a matter of fact, I've been thinking about you quite a lot. When you finish school, you'll be moving to Sydney full time, yes? To pursue your modeling career? Well, I hope so. Well, why not stay at my place? Caroline's apartment? Where would I sleep? In my bed. To Detective Inspector Ian Kennedy, Head of Homicide, New South Wales Police. From Anthony Byrne, re Caroline Therese Byrne. Date of death, 7th of the sixth, '95. I am making this statement to assist the police and the coroner with their inquiry and to give them an insight into the events leading up to Caroline's death, and into the events that have unfolded since her death, knowledge and the information she had of these events and the damage her knowledge could have had on the huge business deals worth millions that unfolded with the sale of the Offset Alpine Printing Group. On the 7th of June last year, sometime between 10.30pm and midnight, a young woman named Caroline Byrne fell to her death here behind me. New South Wales Police are encouraging anyone who has information about this incident, who may have seen Caroline in the vicinity that night who may have seen or heard something, no matter how trivial to please come forward. Constable Camwell is dressed identically to the way Caroline Byrne was on the night. Neville Brown. Fairfax Media. This must be a nightmare. What do you think? Care to comment? Mr. Byrne? Senior Constable Wyver. Brian. You set up this circus? Well, best way to flush out witnesses. Look, the Coroner already had his suspicions, but that letter you wrote certainly expedited matters. So, we're definitely talking murder? Oh, I wouldn't be that hasty. Slowly, slowly catchee monkey. How much slower can we go? In twelve months we've got nowhere. Police Rescue officer recovered the body of ... ...boyfriend Gordon Wood is financial guru Rene Rivkin's driver. ...alerted police, claiming he was guided to the clifftop by Caroline's spirit. Was she pushed? That's the question being asked tonight following today's dramatic reenactment... You told Constable Woods that Caroline had been taking your Rohypnol tablets. Correct. The toxicology report doesn't show any Rohypnol in her system. Well maybe she was lying to me. Why would she do that? Are you aware of Rene Rivkin being involved in any... well, unusual sexual activity? I've heard rumors that he likes to, play a teasing role with people. Men. But, whether or not he has sex with them, with males, I can't say. Have you ever been involved in any homosexual relationships yourself? No. I'm told that Caroline kept a diary. You wouldn't happen to know what became of that, would you? No. Hello, Caroline speaking. Gordy, hi! How are you? Where are you? London. Ah, Rene's apartment. We're staying for a couple more weeks. Are you okay, baby? Two weeks? It's work, okay? Why are you whispering? Rene's asleep. I didn't want to wake him. Why, are you sleeping in the same bed? Goodnight, Gordon. Why was he whispering? It's only a one bedroom flat. Gordon's sleeping on the couch. He didn't want disturb Rene. A multi-millionaire can only afford a one bedroom flat? Caroline? She wanted to know if we were sleeping in the same bed or in separate bedrooms. Would you like to sleep in my bed? I'm joking. Get me a coffee. Gordon Wood appears to be the last person to see Caroline Byrne alive. His version of events does not seem to be correct and is contradicted on a number of occasions. I believe that Wood is not being completely honest when speaking with police. I formed the opinion that he has not disclosed all he knows about the last hours of the deceased's life. It used to make me nervous the way he'd sometimes turn up when Caroline and I were out having a coffee or something, or we'd see him watching her, like he was stalking her. Now following Caroline's death, you forged a friendship of sorts with Mr. Wood. What caused you to break it off? He started coming on to me all the time. Like, one time we were in his apartment and he showed me nude photos of himself. In one of them he had an erection. Is it true to say that without specialized equipment it would be impossible to see something as small as a shoe 30 meters below? Impossible. Even the police helicopter search light was a waste of time. So, a conventional domestic torch would have been hopeless? Totally. So, Gordon Wood's claim to Peter Byrne that he had seen something, legs and a shoe? Like I said, impossible. Maybe Gordy knew where to look. Sergeant, just before you step down, did you observe anything odd about about the distance from the base of the cliff you found Caroline Byrne's body? Yes. In my experience, at the Gap, suicide victims typically land between two and five meters from the cliff. Caroline's body was found approximately 10 meters out. How can the coroner ignore all that? Mate, everything we've heard is circumstantial. We don't have a shred of evidence. Detective Wyver? We've just seen the other bloke that Caroline was with that afternoon in the park. That's him out there. My name's Adam Leigh. I'm the booking clerk for Gordon Charles modeling agency. I would have known Caroline for roughly 18 months. Were you in Watsons Bay park the afternoon of June 7, 1995? No. But you've just heard two witnesses say they saw you there with with Caroline Byrne and Gordon Wood. I know I wasn't there with Caroline and Gordon. As far as I can remember, I can't remember associating with them. But I guess if I did come across them and said hi, look, it wouldn't be no big deal and I wouldn't necessarily remember it. Mr. Leigh, we're talking about the day Caroline Byrne died. Now you knew her very well. Now surely it would have jogged the old memory, wouldn't it? If you'd seen her just hours before she died? Yeah. No! I mean... I don't know Adam Leigh. I certainly wasn't with him at Watsons Bay park that afternoon. I was nowhere near there. I spent 30 minutes at Ditto's Café with two friends. I even ordered some food, then I got a call, so I went to Alife Restaurant where Rene and Graham were lunching. I waited for them to finish and then I took Graham back into town. Graham? Graham Richardson. What, the politician? Ex-politician? Mm-hmm. Mr. Wood, can you explain to me why you told people in the days following her death that Caroline had been run over by a car? Well, I was in the car with my Mum and my sister on the way to the morgue here, and I got a call from Caroline's father, and that's when we had the conversation about that. Now whether he said, tell people it was a car accident or not, I don't remember. I don't think that he did but I think that he did ask me to tell them that it was not suicide. I made no such call. We had no such conversation. We'll check your phone records. There are many anomalies in the evidence I've heard. How did Gordon Wood manage to see a sand shoe or a body below the Gap on a dark night with a barely operating torch? Why did he lie to a wide range of people about how Caroline came to her death? But by far the most telling anomaly is the evidence of the two restaurateurs. I've no reason not to accept that they saw Caroline in Watsons Bay on the day she died with two men they identified as Gordon Wood and Adam Leigh. They had no reason to lie. They are truly men on a Clapham omnibus, as we say in the law. But that does not prove that Wood and/or Leigh was involved in Caroline's death. There are three possibilities. That Caroline Byrne took her own life, that she fell accidentally, or that she was murdered. In order to bring a finding of suicide, I have to be able to say on the evidence that suicide is very probably what occurred. The evidence I have heard does not permit me to make such a finding. In fact, I cannot, on the evidence, raise any possibility to the status of what probably happened. I must record an open finding. Tony. Neville Brown. Sydney Morning Herald. What can I do for you, Neville? I thought we might be able to do a bit of good for each other. She didn't jump. Gordy pushed her. I want to help you nail the bugger so I can be there at the kill. How can I help? For a start, tell me about your wife. It is not domestic, Constable. She hasn't left me for someone else. I think she's done herself harm! Because she bloody well tried before! She was one of the first to have silicone breast implants. Head of the queue. Pure bloody vanity. But a few of those early ones started leaking, remember? Some women even got breast cancer. But she convinced herself she was going to die a slow death. Thought she'd let us all down. We could never convince her otherwise. The number for the morgue, please. She was in the morgue a week before we found her. Me. I had to find her. Police never lifted a finger to help. I should have complained, pursued it, but I didn't. Squibbed it, I guess. It wasn't suicide. Suicidal depression does not run in the family. Gordon Wood murdered Caroline. I won't let him get away with it. Seen the Sunday rag? Apparently, Gordo was going around telling everyone he was Rene's financial adviser, which naturally gave Rene the right royal shits. No wonder he sacked him. He claims he can't remember who the hell he was having lunch with three years ago. Saves you the trouble, then. We'll get to him, don't you worry. Slowly, slowly catchee monkey? Monkey'll die of old age first. Tony, please. It's been three bloody years, Brian. Everyone knows Caroline was murdered. Everyone knows who did it. Why can't we put the bastard on trial? You know as well as I do. Until the DPP's satisfied it's a winnable case, what's the point? Okay. What more can we do to make it winnable, Brian? So, you woke up at 11.30 or 12 o'clock and she's still not there. What do you think? That something major had happened to her. That she was in big trouble. So why didn't you ring her father? Why would I? Because you think she's there. I hoped she was there. Why didn't you ring him? I went around to visit him. -You didn't go in. -No. -Why not? -Her car wasn't there. Why didn't you ring him? Well I was looking for my wife. Did you kill her? Of course not. Why would I kill her? Did you? No. You know he got paid 20 thousand for this. And have you lied? Not once. I wouldn't sit here in front of a TV camera and put myself at the mercy of editors if I had anything to say but the truth. You're pretty cool, aren't you? I have got nothing to hide. Okay. Thank you. So, do you think I did it? I don't know. I guess I'm like the Coroner. Paul Barry there, speaking with Caroline Byrne's boyfriend, Gordon Wood. New South Wales Police would like to speak with anyone who may have been in the vicinity of the Gap on the evening of June 7th, 1995. If that's you, please call Crimestoppers... Jesus Christ, how many fucking times do I have to say it? This is for your own fucking good! This is for us, Caroline. There is no alternative. It is my way or no bloody way. Why can't you get it through your thick head? You've got no fucking choice! Later on, he heard a scream. Corroborating the two fishermen. Can he identify Wood? He can. I think we're almost there. Almost? Well, anything we can do to put some weight to the brief will help, right? Oh, relax. I've got a brilliant idea. So, what do you reckon, professor? There's no way she could have jumped that far out, is there? Well she wasn't pushed, I know that. What makes you say that? Well to land that far out, she'd have needed to take off from the top of the cliff at a speed of 3.5 meters per second. That's running speed. Looks like she jumped to me. -Hello Caroline. -Hi. How are you? Good. Just working out some of my frustrations. Hey... How long have you known Gordon? He worked for me or a couple of years, why? I don't know. Just sometimes he gets in these jealous moods. It scares me. All he ever talks about is making money. All these crazy schemes with Rivkin. When I try to discuss it with him, he just tells me shut up. He tried to get me to invest half a million in that printing company that burnt down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Sometimes I think he wants to kill me. This is a nice surprise seeing you here. -Hi. -Hi. Gordy, hi, it's me. I'm going to be a bit late home tonight. Who are you with? Just a friend from work. You wouldn't know them. Where the fuck are you? One of those places on Stanley Street. I don't know the name of it. You are... You are fucking lying! You are fucking lying! Bit of a jealous type, Gordy? He's asked me to marry him. What do you see in the guy? You're not a girl. I thought he was gay. He's not. That's ridiculous. Stop it. I miss you. We're still friends. Making love to you. It wasn't a coincidence at the gym today, was it? I'm concerned about you. I'm perfectly happy. What, living with a wanker who's up himself? Why do you think Rivkin has him around? For his financial smarts? What happened to Brian Wyver? Brian's moved on. I'm Paul Jacob. This is, Paul Quinn, Matt Moss, and our analyst, Bianca. Welcome to Strikeforce Irondale. We're on a budget? The plan is we go back to the beginning. We re interview everyone, reexamine every statement, every piece of information. We leave no stone unturned. You'll talk to Rivkin? In your heart of hearts, are you sure Caroline didn't take her own life? Caroline? I bought a couple of pies if you want one. Caroline? It was a cry for help. That's all. Never a serious attempt. Well maybe three years on, it was. She would have taken pills. She wouldn't have jumped off a cliff. But you were scared she had. I mean, when Gordon brought you here that night, it was your first thought, yes? If they called us immediately, things would have been different. How can you be so certain? People who suicide don't scream. I think Gordon brought her up here to salvage the relationship. She wanted out, he wanted to keep her. Figured isolating her was the best bet. But after hours of arguing and pleading, he lost his temper, hit her, possibly killing her. Panicked, threw her off. -How does Adam Leigh fit in? -He doesn't. It was a fleeting glimpse walking past the restaurant. I mean, I could pluck out a dozen blokes right now in Kings Cross who' fit the bill. You don't think Rivkin was involved? I always go for the obvious first. She knew way too much about the Offset Alpine fire for mine. Making it even more important for Gordon to keep her inside the camp. The Securities Commission wants to speak to us. Me and Rene. About his dodgy printing company? It's sensitive, commercial in confidence, you know what I'm saying? I knew you shouldn't have got mixed up with that creepy guy. You just wait until I get my bonus. Bonus? The only thing you're going to get is jail time. Shut up, okay? There is no way they're going to dig up anything on him. You hope. I could tell them a thing or two. What? What did you say? Please stay away from him. You had better learn to zip up your mouth. No. It's me or him, Gordon. Your choice. Who do you love? You're a fuckin' idiot, Caroline! Height, 5 foot 10 inches, 35 inch bust, 24 inch waist, 35 inch hips. Favorite color, blue. Favorite foods, vegetarian and seafood. Favorite sport, skiing, actor Hugh Grant, actress Meg Ryan, Favorite singer Mariah Carey. Life's ambition, to continue to have a positive impact with my teaching, whilst fulfilling my personal ambition to be a wonderful wife and mother. Can I have a copy of that? May I have a copy. Pardon? He never said a bad word about the girl in all the years I knew her. In fact, he must have told me how much he loved her five times a day. He was your personal assistant, never your financial adviser? The only matter that Gordon Eric Wood advised me on was the choice of toilet paper. You went onto the man's boat. You played into his hands. Tony, you can't give a guy the third degree and expect to get the truth. I spoke to Richardson, too. Graham Richardson? June 7, 1995, Graham Richardson did not dine with Rene Rivkin at Alife as Gordon claims. He was at the Hilton Hotel, having lunch with Peter "Bullfrog" Moore, the president of the Canterbury-Bankstown Football Club. And, he's got credit card receipts to prove it. So, Gordon could have gone straight back to Watson's Bay and had lunch with Caroline. I told you so! So, you want me to get him to tell as many lies as poss. Is that the idea? I reckon he will talk. I reckon he won't be able to resist. He'll love the challenge of a fresh face. Huge gamble, flying 12,000 miles on the off chance. Gary, the thing you have to understand about Gordy is he's, so much smarter than dumb bums like us. Spend the flying time swotting up on this lot. I've already made two statements been interrogated by the Coroner hounded by the bloody media. I've got nothing more to say. I'm sorry. All we're here to do is clarify a few outstanding matters, Mr. Wood. Give him a moment, for the ego to kick in. You told the Coroner on the way to the morgue in your mother's car, you received a phone call from Tony Byrne, urging you not to tell people that Caroline committed suicide? Is that... You should try the cheese scone, Paul. They're excellent. That's correct. This is, Mr. Byrne's phone records dated June the 8th, 1995. Could you find that call for me, please? Gary, I can't even remember my own number. Was it... was it analogue back then? I believe that's your mobile phone number. Well maybe he called from a phone box. At 5:14pm, your phone was diverted to your paging service. Why was that? Look Gary, I always redirected my phone after work. It's private time. If Rivkin needed me, he'd just find me on the pager. And he did. He called at 5:32pm, at 7:38pm and 8:33pm. Would you mind reading that last entry there for me, please? "Gordon, turn on your phone and advise." What's that mean? Gary, I don't know. It was six years ago. Can you walk me through the time frame from when you woke up that night? Was it about 12:40am, as you originally said, or was it more like 11ish, or 11.30 as you subsequently said on the Witness television program? I lost my fiancé. And I'm still grieving and the only reason why I agreed to help you is because I thought I would help myself. And you're sitting here, you're treating... you're treating me like ... This is so offensive. This is so offensive, Gary, what you're inferring. Do you need a moment to compose yourself? Tissue? If you're asking me did I change my story? Then the answer is no. Well, with time to reflect, Mr. Wood, what time would you say you woke up? I mean, 12:40am's is a very specific time... Look Gary, if I said 12:40 and that was closer closer to the time of the actual incident, then that is probably what I remember to be most correct. Well, can you explain to me then how you had time to walk several kilometers, to your friend's place to pick up the red Ford Ute, and to drive through the eastern suburbs to run along the clifftops, searching for Caroline, before phoning Tony and Peter Byrne at 12:30am, 10 minutes before you woke up? Mate, you're in the wrong job. You should be a forensic pathologist. You chaps in town for a few days? I could show you my London. So what do you think? Am I guilty? Yes, I think you are. If it was murder, then I know who it was. It was, what's his name? Her first boyfriend, the cop. Andrew. -Hi. -What do you want? You're still mad. I don't blame you. I apologize. You come crawling back? I just want us to be friends. Okay, we're friends. You happy? I thought we could get a coffee. Yeah, I'm kinda busy right now. I feel like... I can't... do anything. I can't sleep. I can't ... express myself. Does it ever get so bad that you think about harming yourself? Caroline, has anything happened to trigger these feelings? Things are okay at work? And at home? It isn't Gordon? I'm going to refer you to someone, okay? You should talk to someone. Well when did you last see Caroline? About a week before she died, thereabouts. What was her frame of mind? She was pretty stressed, to be honest. Think she killed herself? No way. I reckon they had a blue, he bashed her. He's a pretty strong guy. So are you. What are you getting at? Where were you the night of June 7? I was with a friend. -Who? -A female friend. A girlfriend, you mean? Where? Rose Bay. Rose Bay? The suburb next to Watsons Bay? So, you were in the area on the night. We're going to need the name of this friend, Andrew. Well that's going to be difficult. She was 17, a schoolgirl, okay? A boarder at some posh school. A schoolgirl? She used to sneak out. I'd meet her at her parent's home in Rose Bay when they weren't home. - And you'd have sex? - Isn't that called carnal knowledge? No, I didn't sleep with her. Yes, we spent the night on the bed but we didn't touch. It's going to be bloody hard to give you a name. I think she's married now. You were with her the whole night? Yeah. Yeah, her sister was there. She can tell you. I know who the killer is. You know who he is, and it's not this dill. The sisters back him up. Plus, he's got a medical certificate saying he'd just had a knee reconstruction. So, whoever was up on that cliff it wasn't him. I agree with you. So, what's stopping us going to the DPP and getting -a warrant for Wood? -I can prove Gordon was up there but I can't prove he threw Caroline off. We need a witness. Did you talk to Adam Leigh? He's in a mental institution in Victoria. He's walking around with tin foil on his head. He's not our second man, brother. Where is everybody? Off on other matters. So, we just forget about Caroline Byrne. Dump her in the too hard basket. Tony, I'm on this until we get a conviction. I promise you that. What were you doing in Zurich? I was accompanying Mr. Rivkin. What was your business? I had no business. I'm his personal assistant. I go where he goes. Did you place phone calls for him? No. Answer the phone for him? - Occasionally. - What do you know about his share transactions? Nothing. I just carry his bags. I buy his cigars and pick up his dry cleaning, organize insurance. When I say personal assistant, I mean valet. I run errands. Actually, I was supposed to pick up his dry cleaning and run him over here 20 minutes ago so, if that's all ... Hello Carel, this is Gordon Wood, Caroline Byrne's boyfriend. I just had a call from her doctor. She's been over there since she finished work. Apparently, she's undergoing some tests. she's very sick and all the doctor told me was that she won't be at work for a while. It's Carel Clifford here. The poor girl. Hello, Carel. How are you? Indeed. She... I'll get back to you, maybe 1ish tomorrow and just to, let you know how she's going, okay? I've spoken to my local member. He's going to raise it in the House. I was hoping you might add your voice to it. Glad to. But a quote would be good. It's a terrible day for victims of crime when a murder goes unsolved for lack of detectives. This is where she landed. It can't be! It is. Well the good news is, I've changed my mind. She couldn't have jumped that far out even allowing for the drop. And besides, bio mechanics tells us that if you jump feet first, you're going to land feet first every time. So, she had to be thrown? That is good news. now for the bad news. There isn't room for an adequate run up. Not here. In fact, there's only one place where you could get a decent run up and that's here. Well how would he know when to pull up? It was pitch black that night. Only after moonset, which wasn't until 1:00am. Now I say he had plenty of light, and he was running slightly uphill. He could see the edge. I say he picked her up and threw her because well, he was running on pure adrenaline. But, there is more bad news. The distance from the northern ledge to where she was found is now even greater. It's now 11.8 meters. Could two men have thrown her that far? I'll find out. Is it possible to throw a woman weighing 57 kilos almost 12 meters out from a 30 meter cliff? Okay, okay. The key to achieving distance is what? Speed. Give that man a cigar. Speed. -What's this all about? -Professor? Rod Cross, Tony Byrne. -Nice to meet you. -How are you doing? We are about to make history. Now, factoring in the 30 meter drop, our woman needed to be thrown at a minimum velocity of 4.5 meters per second. Camille? Fellas, you're on. Let's go. Now Man B, over 3 attempts managed an average throw speed of 4.2 meters per second. The Man A, attempt one, 4.71 meters per second. Attempt two, 4.83 meters per second and attempt 3, with Camille fully limp as in unconscious, 4.71 meters per second. Which means he could have thrown Caroline 12 meters. Exactly. What about the two blokes working together? No, no, they could barely manage an average throw speed of 4.1 meters per second. No, Caroline Byrne was not thrown off the Gap by two men. She was thrown off the Gap by one strong man, alone. Gordon Wood. You come back here this instant! Are you listening to me, Caroline? Are you listening? Baby, I love you. Just come home, baby.
