I won't say a word!!!" "Speak!" "Speak!" Please, be silent behind the screen "Long live free Georgia!!!" "I will get you for this." "A Russian Affair" George Valentin That's the question on everyone's lips. Who indeed? VARIETY: Who's that girl? KINOGRAPH STUDIOS "Listen up! Three girls who can dance!" "The name's Miller. Peppy Miller!" "Clifton, go to the jewelry store. Get something nice for my wife. To make it up to her." "With all your nonsense, they don't mention our movie until page 5!" "Where are you going, Miss? We have a picture to shot." "If you want to be an actress, you need to have something the others don't." And Peppy Miller as Miss Isadora "I have something to show you." "May I have my chair?!" "Hey, you're not Napoleon. You're just an extra!" SOUND TEST Constance Gray in Romeo & Juliet "Don't laugh, George! That's the future." "If that's the future, you can have it!" Kinograph Studios Stop All Silent Productions To Work Exclusively On Talkies "You and I belong to another era, George. The world is talking now." "People want new faces, talking faces.' "I wish it wasn't like this, but the public wants fresh meat and the public is never wrong." "I'm the one people come to see. They never needed to hear me!" "Make your talking movies. I'll make a great movie. And it's not like I need you for that!" THE NEW FACES OF KINOGRAPH Peppy Miller "Fresh meat..." "What a coincidence, I was just thinking about you. I signed with Kinograph!" "Maybe now we'll do another picture together!" "Toys!" "I'm not a puppet, I'm an artist!" "Talkies are not serious" for George Valentin "We have to talk, George." "Why do you refuse to talk?" "I'm unhappy, George." "So are millions of us." "Your movie doesn't come out until tomorrow and you're, already Hollywood's new sweetheart! How do you explain that?" "I don't know. Maybe because I talk and the audience can hear me." "People are tired of old actors mugging at the camera to be understood." "Out with the old, in with the new. Make way for the young!" "That's the life!" "I've made way for you." STOCK MARKET CRASH "It looks like we've gone bust." "Unless the movie is a big hit..." "Hello. I wanted to talk to you. I..." "I just saw Tears of Love." "And now want a refund?" "Not too much mugging?" "No. I'm sorry about last night. I didn't mean what I said..." "But you were right. Make way for the young..." "It's an honor to meet you. My father is a big fan." "Ok. We're going now. I'll call you soon." "Take me home. I want to be alone." "How long has it been since I last paid you, Clifton?" "One year, sir." "You're fired." "I'm not kidding, Clifton. You're fired." "Keep the car. And find yourself another job." "I don't want another job." TO-NIGHT AUCTION SALE Famed Hollywood Actor: George Valentin "Congratulations! It's all sold, you've got nothing left!" "Excuse me, may I trouble you one moment?" "If only he could talk!" "Look what's become of you..." "You've been stupid! You've been proud!" "Get Back here,you loser!" "Oh my God! That's George Valentin!" "I'll get my car!" "I'll say one thing, he owes his life to that dog!" "We're ready. Go get Miss Miller." "He's out of danger. He needs rest now." "He was clutching this. It was hard to get it away from him." "You think he could rest at my house?" "I have to be on the set at nine o'clock. We're shooting a very important scene." "Just think of it! *Sparkle of Love*, starring George Valentin and Peppy Miller!" "George is a silent movie actor. He's a nobody now." "What are you doing?" "I won't work anymore. It's either him or me." "What I mean is, it's him AND me! Or it's neither of us!" "Hey, I'm blackmailing you! Get it?" "All right, send him the damn screenplay." "I work for Miss Miller now." "Once again, she's looking out for you." "Beware of your pride, if I may say so sir. Miss Miller is a good person, believe me." "CLIFTON!" "BANG!" "I feel so bad. I only wanted to help you, take care of you..." "If only you would let me help you, George Valentin." "It's impossible, Peppy. I'm washed up. No one wants to see me speak." "There is one thing we could try. Trust me." Cut! Perfect! Beautiful! Can you give me just one more? With pleasure. - Back to one! - OK, back to one, guys. - Everybody, quiet please! - Back to one.
