Everyone is alone and no one cares about anyone And our pains are a deserted island... To Jacques Brel. who will give a circus show for me nostalgic love in the dust who will make me go "I'm scared" the knife in the heart, in the limelight who will treat me like a tigress the whip like a caress to the music who will make me balance between balloons full of pathos sometimes I panic who will tell me words of love that can hurt who will hold me ITINERARY OF A SPOILED CHILD when you'll release all the stars who will want me with my red nose and my heart full of tears who will love me when there won't be much of me left anymore who will still make me dream the clown or the rider who emerges from the shadow who will still bring me the artist's performance the trapeze artist's show see him fall who will still bring me the child that plays for the performing dogs or the vampires Don't you have a ticket? Where's your mother? Where? In the bar? Wait, I'll check. This boy says his mother's in the bar. Could you have a look? Ask for the mother of the boy. Wait a moment. What's your name? Sam? What have you got there? Can I have a look? Is that your mother's? Sam's three years old. I can't keep him. I'm desperate. Look after him. I beg you. three years later Sam, 13 years old Sam, 16 years old it has a silver shine the itinerary of a spoiled child is littered with broken toys the itinerary of a spoiled child The last time I saw him, was just before he left. He wanted to get to know himself. This solitary voyage was a challenge he added to all the storms in his life. He always said: when I spend some hours with you, I want to believe. When I spend an evening with my children, I want to believe in family. When I'm with a woman, I want to believe in love. That's Sam Lion for you. You know why he was called that, don't you? He was found near a circus and when he was registered... the circus master called him Sam Lion because he was always near the lions. This is the best day of my life. -Because it's beautiful here. Where does all this water go? -To Lake Kariba. It's beautiful. Rainbows come straight out of the water. The most beautiful spot in the world. Will we see all of that? You and I? Look a rainbow. Quick. Make a wish. When he falls from the trapeze, he becomes a street sweeper... so he can stay with the carnival. He wins a prize for best sweeper and gets the award from Yvette... who becomes his wife. They have a son, Jean-Philippe. Then the big drama happens in Singapore. He has to raise Jean-Philippe on his own. It takes him ten years to recover and meet Corine. Ten years to turn his little business into an international company. Ten years before he can smile again upon seeing a child's face. Magnificent. You look more and more like your mother. -Then you must be starting to hate me. Whose idea was it to go here? -Mine. I wanted to go to Venice, but Corine had already been there. Then I realised they have even more water here. Who decided to call me Victoria? -Your mother. She's sure you were conceived here. In this area. I'm glad it wasn't near the Niagara Falls. You were almost called Isabelle. Because I loved Jacques Brels song. It's about his daughter. But because of this spectacle, you became Victoria. How did you get the business? After my accident, I was responsible for keeping the circus clean. I looked for machines to do the work. What shall we do tonight? American dinner, tamtam, birthday cake, champagne. The good life. Doesn't that give you ideas? -Why not? I watched them this morning. It's great what they do. Look, he's the best one. Unbelievable what he does. Imagine, autumn on the Champs-Elys?es. 'Ballet with Brooms'. When will the machines be introduced? -In a month. How did you get the idea? My daughter and I saw them on our travels and we improved on them. They say a minister is interested in buying them. That makes sense. It's of interest to the public. Are you really going to buy a circus that has gone bankrupt? I love the circus, but that's nonsense. I only hired people who were about to be fired. This is my secretary, by the way. The only secretary to land safely after a death-defying leap. Most of the time. How did you become the biggest in your trade, in 10 years? Step in the shit often and always clean it up. So this machine will replace street sweepers? This machine can clean 10 kilometres per day. A person can do 1 kilometre. The operator can also use the machine as a mode of transport. But most of all, the operator doesn't make contact with the garbage anymore. The work will get a better reputation and will also be performed by students. So, sweepers will be unemployed. The machine can't reach everywhere and traditional sweepers are still required. But they should learn to use roller-skates. Do you find this funny? -Not at all. I need to talk to you. -I understand. What do you mean? -I'm just saying I understand. I don't want to go to the hotel. It's not a hotel, it's where I live. It's also about the rest. What? I don't have anything. This machine's my first moped. What do you want? What do I have to do to keep you? Drive a pink Cadillac? Wait a moment. Wait. Here, this is for you. What is it? -Have a look. I'd like to take you there. Near Victoria Falls. Are you going? Alright. Can I keep this? -It's a present. Will you be roller-skating for long? -I don't know. Aren't you taking that thing? -Leave it. I'll take it tomorrow. When will you get married? -Ask him. Miss, bring me the file of Albert Duvivier. It's a machine to pick up shit with, not girls. And how often have I told you to wear your helmet? Can I speak to the boss? -I'm your direct superior. I want to speak to whoever makes the rules, not to who enforces them. Can you swim? -Breast stroke. Swim into the Atlantic Ocean and you might see him. Damn. That's not clear. Repeat, please. -Your position, Victoria? I repeat 42 North, 26 West. Still the same. Speak clearly, dear. I ask him to call you. -In an hour. I have things to do. End of call. -Fine. So that's 42 North... That's not my position at all. Hello, Saint-Lys. Is there anybody at the pump? -C?line. I'm here. What do I have to do? -Help them with the crossing. How long will that take? -Two weeks. Will I be washing dishes for two weeks? Victoria Lion Starting Point I'll summarize. Take it easy with the pills. What's more important... Are you listening? Take your boat out mornings, afternoons and evenings... and get far away from us, for at least a month. You can't quit smoking like that either. Want to bet? Is it that serious? -It's in your head. That's good. I'll see you at dinner. Are you still with Martine? -I'll tell you later. Jean-Philippe, your father's not doing well. I fear a nervous breakdown. He shouldn't continue to live close to his work. It's not good to live in a caravan, especially for him. I'll give him a prescription, but talk to him. We have to get through to him. Is he doing that bad? What is happiness then? -You'd like to know, wouldn't you? Well, happiness is... it's... When there is no trouble. And you have to keep it that way. You must be very tired to talk like that. What tired you out the most in life? Your mother. Didn't you love her a bit? -Yes. Or you wouldn't have been born. And did you love Jean-Philippe's mother? Can't we talk about something else? -You don't want to talk about anyone. Are you angry with me? I'm glad you still look human. You should see the car. Can you explain to me why we don't get along, dad? I've sent you to schools that were too good. While we both run Victoria, I can't be myself. Hold on a bit longer. I won't stay for long. That's not what I mean. You sleep at Victoria, you eat it, you drink it. You sail Victoria. It's all you think about. We never have time to talk. To spend an evening together. Do you really want to cross the ocean? -I've been sailing for 30 years. The bay of St. Tropez isn't the same thing. Anything urgent? I'm not available for anyone. You can't do this. Can't I go out on the ocean? -You're abandoning 12,000 employees. No, I'm not. I'm selling a company. Quite a company. You can't. You are the company. Who can buy a company like that? -What about these walls? What will you do with the money? -I haven't had a break for 50 years. Two days of holiday and you'll go mad. -I want to try. The doctor said he won't start again. -What should I do? Look. -What should I do? Ride a bicycle. Look at him. He goes from one to the next. Look. I want to write a book. Think I can? -A book? Why not? And I want to go to the US. -Is he American? Unbelievable. You always take me to the circus. -Of course. My two big passions in life. When I was young, I always wanted to marry you. And now? -I'd be too scared you'd leave me. But I do want someone like you. Shall I tell you something? I'm not a good catch. I don't believe that. -It's true. What's a good catch? -Someone who doesn't think too much. That only leaves the idiots. -Don't believe that. Better late than never. You're even late on the day of your divorce. Especially then. Don't they know what the party's for? -I was waiting for you. Is this a joke? -Don't pull that face. It's a party. You should celebrate the day of escape, not the day of imprisonment. Isn't she beautiful, my divorced wife? You look good. -So do you. Will she be in time? -I think so. When did she decide to come back? -The day before yesterday. I knew she wouldn't like New-York. She's too French. What's wrong? -Nothing. Everything's fine. Look, there she is. What has she got in her arms? -She'll explain later. You explain it to me. -He's six months old and his name's Sam. His name's Sam, he's six months old and I'm the grandfather. Is that right? Where's the father? Not here. Of course. Does the father know, at least? It's better like this. Do you want to know what I really think? I'm the happiest man in the world. Look, he's got my eyes. Not because she's my daughter, but it's great. I would love it if you could publish it. If there's a problem, you know where to find me. Don't tell my daughter, please. What are you doing here? -Your pills. Those pills. They're alright, it's the rest. Everything goes wrong. Wait. I told you to be here before the personnel. What's this? Do you call this advertising? Everything you do, I have to do again. Did they pay? Good, I'll call you back right away. We'll see each other tonight. Did you read your sister's book? -What's it about then? A 25 year old girl falls in love with a 50 year old man. He's a bit like you. -And then? He gives everything up to go with her. That's why it's called 'Starting Point'. How are you? -Excellent. I can't hear you well. -Excellent! Are you coming back soon? -Not really. We're all coming to the harbour. And my son? -We haven't seen him much. When will you be back? -In a couple of days. Why? Are there problems? Not really, but we have to make some decisions. Well, take them. Hello? I can't hear you anymore. Hello? I can't hear anything anymore. Finished. Is this really it? -Yes. How can I reach you? -I'll write when I get there. It's far away, isn't it? -Yes, it's Africa. Where is it exactly? -I don't know yet. I'll find out. What can I say? If it fails, I'll be here. I know. You're always here. Alright, dad. Take care. Goodbye. It's in a hurry. who will give a circus show for me nostalgic love in the dust who will make me go "I'm scared" the knife in the heart, in the limelight who will treat me like a tigress the whip like a caress to music who will make me balance between balloons full of pathos sometimes I panic who will tell me words of love that can hurt -Good morning. who will hold me when you'll release all the stars who will want me with my red nose and my heart full of tears who will love me when there won't be much of me left anymore who will still make me cry the clown or the rider who emerges from the shadow who will still bring me the artist's performance the trapeze artist's show see him fall who will still bring me the child that plays for the performing dogs or the vampires who will do the final act for me to seduce me to smile who will tell me words of love that can hurt who will hold me when you'll release all the stars who will want me with my red nose and my heart full of tears who will love me when there won't be much of me left anymore Remember what you told me last week? -Last week I was tired. As far as eating, drinking and fucking are concerned, animals do better than we. You're talking like a spoiled child. Animals die of heart attacks too. What about priests and heart attacks? What reunites us here is his love of others. Many of us know that he didn't need much reason to come to our help. I've often heard him complain about the company and talk about selling... but then he'd think of all of you and nothing changed. Victoria and Jean-Philippe, you now have to survive this storm. He once told me... if you love sun, rain and wind, you have to believe in God. Let's pray for the days that he did believe. Do you really speak French? -If you want to talk to us, yes. A taxi driver told me this was the place to go in Hamburg. It's 300 marks for an hour, 1000 marks for a night... and free if you marry me. I need false papers. You'd have to go to granny. She has the most contacts. Careful, there's a lot of police here. -I didn't do anything. What's your speciality? -Anything, if you pay. Did granny explain? I don't make papers, I find them. -That's better. With the Cologne Carnival approaching, it won't take very long. Is Cologne far? -400 kilometres. Is it nice? -It's special. Want to know why I do this work? You don't want to talk? When you ask someone how they are, you take a big risk. Don't you like me? My daughter's your age. I don't know anyone who loves the carnival this much. Me neither. Will you really use those 20 tickets? -I have nothing else to do. Well done. Have you got work? -Not really. Come. Come. Mr Van den Berghe, architect. 50,000 dollars for one hour. What do I have to do? Deliver three bags at D?sseldorf Station. Three bags? It's only the two of them. I'm sorry. I always work alone. Your passport, please. I see you also fly to New-York. Cancel Tokyo. Tokyo? -Cancel it. Do you also fly to Papeete? -Cancel New-York. Give me Papeete. Papeete. If you tell me what you're looking for, I might be able to help. Good question. First, I'll go for some sun. It's the wet season there. Where do they go when it rains? Papeete after all then? I only have smoking. I'll start smoking again then. Are you doing that bad? Ladies and gentlemen, we're descending towards Papeete. It's 39 degrees. Tighten your seatbelts. an island an island off the shore of hope where men would not be afraid and soft and calm like your mirror an island clear as Easter morning offering the ocean's languor with a mermaid on each wave come, come, my love there, there won't be any of those madmen who tell us to be wise or that twenty is the beautiful age here comes the time to live here comes the time to love an island, an island off the shore of love placed on the altar of the sea satin lying down on velvet an island, warm as tenderness hoping like a desert for a rain cloud's caress come, come, my love there, there won't be any of those madmen who hide the long beaches from us come, my love let's flee the storm here comes the time to live here comes the time to love an island, which we still have to build but that could hold on to the dreams we dream as two an island, that's about to depart that has been sleeping in our eyes since the doors of childhood come, come, my love because it's there that it all begins I believe in the last chance and you are the one I want here comes the time to live here comes the time to love an island disillusioned flower salesman the itinerary of a spoiled child God believes in those who looked for him the itinerary of a spoiled child Isn't that jacket warm? -A bit. Why do you wear it? -To protect myself. Do you believe that yourself? It's because Yvette gave it to you in Singapore. Where did you put the jacket, sir? On my bag, when I bought my ticket to Papeete. The car will come later. This is a honeymoon. When there won't be much of me left anymore Stop, Yvette. You were very sweet at the cemetery, yesterday. I wanted to bring you flowers. It was the first time I saw you cry. Can I touch you? How do you like Jean-Philippe? -You're rather hard on him. You didn't raise him. Yvette. Come back, damnit! Where were you? Sorry, ladies and gentlemen. That happens with ghosts. Careful, or I'll leave again. A little kiss. Smile. Perfect. you're successful in business and lucky in love you often change secretaries your office is in a high tower from which you look down upon the city from where you control your universe the largest part of your life you're in the air between New York and Singapore you always travel first class you have a second home in every Hilton on earth you can't handle misery you're not happy although you seem to be you didn't lose your sense of humour when you got your sense of business you're successful and proud of it you only regret one thing you're not doing what you wanted to do you wanted to be an artist to do your act when the plane lands on the runway in Rotterdam or Rio you wanted to be a singer in order to say who you are you wanted to be an author in order to make up your life in order to make up your life you wanted to be an actor in order to become someone else every day and to admire yourself in colour, on the big screen in colour, on the big screen you wanted to be an artist so you could say why you exist Van den Berghe, Belgium. Architect? Are there many French here? -The whole kitchen crew's French. Where are you from? -Belgium. A Belgian beer. With foam? -Without. Yes, that's better. On holiday. Victoria Falls? It's beautiful. I'll put something under the table-leg. It's the humidity. Where's my bungalow? Which number? Number 12. I'll take you there. You don't seem to need a guide? -I've got a good map. Nice to have a Frenchman here. -A Belgian. But you don't have a Belgian accent. -I can produce one. Tomorrow morning, the elephants might have breakfast with you. Do you like animals? -They're interesting. This is Snow White's house. There are lots of mosquito's here. Will you stay for long? Are you a cop or a barman? I may have come across confused. You look like an uncle of mine, but without a beard. Here, thanks. Dinner's at 7:30. I'll go for a walk. Alright. Breakfast is at 6:30. They're going for it. I have nothing to eat. Are you going with us? Don't you have a guide? Excuse me. Hello. -Hello, sir. Early bird? I've got the day off. Did you take good pictures? -Yes, you with the lions. Any more? -No. What's that? From when is this? -It's been in the hotel for months. Did you show it to anyone? -No, no one. Behind you. Don't turn around. It's your fault that I ended up here. All this talk about Victoria. I was one of the 12,000 employees. You were looking for roller skaters and since I was good at it... And then I got fired. You fired me. What's your name? Albert Duvivier. They call me Al. You're not afraid of lions. Or of you. Journalists always exaggerate a bit. It's a small world. Nobody would believe me. Who will you tell? I'm just saying... Good. Don't you feel at ease? Stop moving around I'm getting seasick. Why did you do it? Because I felt like it. Wasn't business going well? You know enough by now. I can keep a secret. It's more than a secret. If you'd explain, at least I'd understand. I left behind what I loved the most. Do you understand that? No. What's your price? No, I won't sell them, because... Anyway, I don't have the photos anymore. Be honest. You wanted to blackmail me. No, I wanted to sell them. -And what do you call that? Blackmail. I changed my mind. Why did you do that with the lion? Do you ever toss a coin? Do you ever play Russian roulette? -No, I don't. What shall I do? Kill you or bribe you? I'd prefer the first solution. No, the second. I really don't know what to do with you. I don't know what to do with me either. What's your price? I have no price. Like with the tip. I won't tell anyone. I'll work with you, if you like. Sell everything and come here to study the lions. You've never had 12,000 employees. Is it true what the newspapers write? There's something wrong. People often go missing at sea to reappear years later. Do you know of an island without telephone? Just say you got a mast against your head... and have been suffering from amnesia. Are you an author or a barman? -I said it to help you. Have you got any family? My father and sister. -What do they do? They have a hotel. Well... There's hotels and hotels. I can understand you wanted to abandon 12,000 employees. I can also understand you wanted to abandon your wife or wives. I can understand all that. But I can't understand how you could abandon your children. You're driving too fast, sir. Where are we going? Where? -To my children. 'It would be a pleasure to work with you if you come back to France. I'm asking you because of your youth, your talent and your success in Canada. And also because I can see many similarities between you and me. Our company needs a man like you. I hope to welcome you soon. Sam Lion. ' So you're the last person to see my father? At least, I'm the last person to have dined with him. How did you get to know him? He contacted me because I had a similar company as he. In Canada. Montreal. And why did you leave Canada? I was homesick. France will always be France. Of course. The letter, the handwriting... It affects me. And? Once I brought up the circus, all doors opened up. And Jean-Philippe? -He asked when you wrote the letter. Just before you sailed off, I said. We had had dinner, just like you told me. We talked business and just before you left, you gave me the letter. Did you tell him the way you're telling me now? Yes, but I was... -More at ease. Yes, completely at ease. Did you understand why the company's doing so bad? I tried to find out more. He explained things to me, but it was very technical. I don't think I completely understood him. He talked about debts the company had when you died. Debts? Go away. I'll explain. We have to play it very safe. Are you ready? What do you mean, safe? From now on, don't do or say anything without talking to me first. Within half a year, you'll be a captain of industry. You'll have to wear another suit. Pinstripe suits are out. Tomorrow, you'll get a room in the city. In a fancy hotel. Four stars. But you have to learn to say hello. -Excuse me? Saying hello properly is one of the most important things in life. It's half the job. Say hello to me. No, with conviction. Say hello as if I'm ill. Again. Now, I feel you're more interested in me than in yourself. People prefer that you talk about them, rather than about yourself. Say hello again. That wasn't good. I noticed it. You can feel it yourself now, right? Can I smile? -As long as it's with compassion. Don't smile too hard. You'll often be confronted with things you don't know. Pretend you know them. The best way to suggest you know everything... is to never show surprise. Understood? You often show surprise. That's your weakness. We'll do a test. I'll say a few things and you can't look surprised. Understood? Concentrate. Did you know your father used to get it on with the petrol station attendant? I don't want to see surprise. -Yes, but that... You just can't show surprise. Imagine your father with the petrol station attendant. There you go again. -Another example. It's a gripping example. -It is. Concentrate. You look like Jesus. You're doing it again. Can't I do anything? -No, nothing. Look into the distance. -Absent-minded? Not too much. Nothing. Yes? -Go on then because I... Now I see surprise because I'm not saying anything. I'd be surprised. I did exactly as you said. I like you. I don't know if... -That's surprising. Is this still part of the test or... -Of course. But you said... -Don't let it surprise you. Alright. Are you religious? I don't know. To my son, you're deeply religious. To my daughter, you're an atheist. And to you? -I only believe in mathematics. We get what we deserve. Do I deserve to be here with you? I'm starting to think so. There he is. Say hello. Coffee? Did you sleep well? You get used to it. Look, nice and fresh. Do you still want to give us a hand? -Of course. She'll show you around. I'm going to the pump. What did you do in Belgium? -I was with the circus. I love the circus. -I was only a bookkeeper. Will you stay for long? -Until I get a work permit. Has Alex left yet? I hope he'll be successful for once. You have to go and buy stuff. We're out of things. Did it use to look like that? -Yes, we were almost in the woods. I'm here for Mr Jean-Philippe Lion. Mr Duvivier for you. My sister, Victoria. Mr Verne, our notary. An old friend, who'll do the talking. In which part of Canada were you? The factories were up north. The office was in Montreal. Beautiful country. Our company's about to be taken over. You understand we can't hire you. I'm prepared to accept a trial period. At no expense. That's very friendly. But we have more problems, that we can't talk about. Can I say something? When you saw dad, was he alright? Yes, he's fine. Was fine. -My sister asks because... when he left, he was very tired and depressed. We even thought of suicide. -Not at all. Your father's... was in good shape... both physically and mentally. So don't worry. You don't agree to a trial period? We do... -No, Victoria. I consider that letter to be dad's last instructions. Of course. I'll let you talk amongst yourselves. I'll say hello. I mean goodbye. I'm jetlagged. See you soon. I'll show you out. How's your mother? -Fine. And little Sam? -All fine. Sorry, but it failed. I did what I could, but they didn't want it. Your son and daughter agreed, but... the notary was completely against it. He said they're firing people at the moment and can't hire anyone. Sit down. The notary seemed to be in charge. I did exactly what you said. I never showed any surprise. That notary's starting to surprise me. Really? I was also surprised... but I didn't show it. What are you doing there? I haven't been able to explain everything. When I dined with Sam Lion in New-York, just before his departure... he gave me the letter of recommendation... and also a suitcase with important documents. He made a last minute decision not to take it with him. Check his face to see how he takes that information. If he seems worried, you're on the right track. Keep going. One of those documents is a copy of his last will. Some manipulation seems to have occurred between... what the document says and the beneficiaries. When he starts thinking and becomes curious... he'll no doubt continue the conversation himself. I'm listening. This is my proposition... You do everything I say... or I'll show the documents to the parties involved. He won't speak for a long time. Then he'll say those documents are false and you're blackmailing him... that you're a fraud. -You want to blackmail me. Those papers must be false. -Perfect... Then you stay silent even longer. Keep looking him in the eye... without blinking and without showing any surprise. That way you'll scare him. It's all in the eyes, And then you'll say: Then the children will have to choose between a blackmailer and a crook. You'll see him regain some hope. And he'll try something else. A blackmailer and a crook... may go well together. If he wants to collaborate, that's it. Don't say anything but look... the way Elliott Ness looked when Al Capone wanted to bribe him... and wait until he bows his head. Maybe he'll raise his head for a moment like a floored boxer. Look him in the eye. And then knock him out. He seems like a fine man. A great man. Your father really wanted him. A rara avis. If he sings as well as he looks... it would be stupid not to use him. What do you think? When I saw the letter, I agreed right away. And since I wanted to slow down a bit, this is the moment. Never hint at the notary's embezzling. This is an impressive office. Can I look around? Treat Jean-Philippe very carefully. Dad must have told you about his love of the circus. He wanted to turn his office into a circus museum. Not very functional. Never go against Jean-Philippe. He has a passion for architecture. He told me a lot about his passion for lions. Yes, lions were his big passion. What I hate about this type of architecture... is that there is no separation between the workers and the board. That's the circus, the team spirit. My father always said: a boss has to be able to see what the personnel are doing. and the personnel always have to know where the boss is. He's got a point. -But it's impractical. Yes, you're right. Then you'll be assigned an office. When you're alone, call me. If he asks where you live... Where do you live? -Since I came back from Canada... I've been staying with my dad, outside of Paris. It's quiet. Telephone. -I'll take it there. Here, you do it. Ask for the balance sheets of the past three years... with all the corresponding documents. Or else you won't make any decision. Bring them tonight. It went fine with your son. Better than with your daughter. A list of urgent things. Give it to my secretary. When I call and you can't speak, cough. Always ask for time to think. Bring your portable phone. You have to explain this. -We've got all night. Did you ask my secretary to find you a room? -Yes. Did you discuss your salary? -Yes, I told them what you told me. I keep saying to Jean-Philippe that we'll discuss it later. About my son... It's normal that he's nice to you. He's always nice to young people. By the way, tell your father not to eavesdrop. Or ask him to help us. Can we get some too? Telephone. Are you available for dinner tonight? Such a smart computer can't be wrong. Ask for a printed copy. We have to be on top of this. Take your time. I'm busy. That gives me an excuse not to go tonight. I'm coming over. Am I interrupting? -Not at all. Come in. My mother wants to meet you. She's inviting you to dinner. I'd love to, thanks. Is tonight alright? Tonight's difficult, because there's a problem in South America. I have to see him... I have to read all the files. I'll see if I can cancel my dinner. Have a seat. I'll be right back. Anything wrong? -No, I'm going with Jean-Philippe. Dad's hat? -I'm always wearing it. How's mum? -She's nostalgic. That's her. -I know. I couldn't cancel the dinner. So I can't tonight. But some time next week's fine. -We'll do that then. I also wanted to thank you for everything you're doing for us. It's nothing special. Dad would be very jealous if he saw you. I understand he liked you. -You're impressive too. You still dress the same way. How do you know? -I know all about you. He tells me things every day. Told me. He told me about you each night. You're a bit like him. -Do you think? Not physically... but your attitude, your boldness. The way you greet people, how calm you are, things like that. Have a seat. I'll try one more time to cancel my dinner. I'll be right back. Do I have to continue to pretend? -When I say no, it's no. They keep talking about you. You're still important in their lives. That's why I left. Do you still not understand? I noticed that your daughter... is a bit like you. You should really consider going back to them. If I wanted that, I wouldn't go through all this trouble. They're not biting today. -We're not forced to fish either. Alright, I'll go. You spend lots of money on unnecessary things. And you don't keep check of your expenses, That's not good. And the way you chase the personnel. I'm embarrassed. Is that all? -No. Al's fed up with the hotel and wants to live in dad's caravan. Can I come in? -Make yourself at home. This is your house now. Not very nice, this close to work. Didn't your dad like it? -Yes, but he loved the circus. Don't you? -No, I hate it. I'm surprised. Your sister loves it, I believe. Yes, she does. Is it on tonight? Tonight? Oh, tonight. I wanted to say I'm happy about how we work together. We're a very good team. It seems best to me to keep it strictly business. I'm here, Jean-Philippe. Oh, is it you? -I wanted to know if you're alright. This is a very luxurious caravan. I'm very grateful. I'll be off then. What do you think of him? -Strapping. I like blacks who are really black. He is. We're in a very difficult situation. Goal. Yes, goal. You're kidding me. There are some bad things happening here. You're having fun, but I'm not having fun with your computers. This is a misunderstanding. It's not my birthday today. This is because you've been with us for a year. That's nice of you. Shall I blow the candle? There's something else. -Where are we going? With a birthday comes a present. Dad loves old-timers. We want to give you one. -You can't. Choose one. No, you can't. -Yes. You love those cars. I can't accept it. I couldn't choose anyway. They're all beautiful. I wouldn't know. I'll just pick the closest one. I'm speechless. -Dad once put it very well: Never give someone a present that you don't love yourself. I'm driving a car that used to belong to Sugar Ray Robinson. Unbelievable. I'd like to have lunch together. I'd rather have dinner with you. -That's alright too. I'll introduce you to someone who might become important to me. Since you've taken over dad's role, I want to hear your opinion. Are you planning on getting married? -Yes, if he agrees. If he agrees? Why not? I don't know who it is. She'll introduce me to him. It's simple: if he's ok, you approve. And if not, I reject him? -Of course. Talking about marriage. C?line's getting married today. A beautiful car, isn't it? Beautiful family. -Yes, they're nice. Is something wrong? Family makes you think of family. -That's true. But why do you say that? I'd like to see them again. Just once. Once. How did you end up here? I was here for work and I was almost out of petrol. I saw this petrol station attendant who looks just like your dad. Everyone has a double. -Exactly. He's not a real copy of your father, of course. That's a nice ride. Perfect. Where's the hole? It's well hidden. They don't make them like this anymore. -It's from'57-'58. It used to belong to Sugar Ray Robinson, the boxer. You had La Motta and Dauthuille. I remember Dauthuille well. Graziano was the world champion. He never gave up. Always attacked. Bang, and down. I've seen Robinson box against Big Man. Ray was good... and he had a good left hook... but he didn't cut it. Not enough stamina. Striking, isn't it? -Yes, unbelievable. He doesn't really look like him, but it's how he acts. And Max Schmeling... he was very fast. The way he'd come back with a left hook. He was younger. But he'd look a bit like this now. Did anyone ever tell you, you look a lot like Sam Lion? How's that? -Sam Lion. What weight category? -No, a business man. A business man? Me? No, kid. That's full again. That's 400 francs. Yes, it's a guzzler. 500, I have to change that. -No, never mind. Well, thanks. You're as generous as Robinson. Could you do the windscreen? -Of course, that's part of the job. For that money, I'd polish your shoes. That lady has beautiful eyes. One moment. If you're in a hurry, do it yourself. It's true... strong as a bear. I don't mean it in a bad way... but I get the impression your fianc?'s not very polite. He's always very punctual. There are always exceptions to the rule. He's also very special. Wait, this is wrong. You're influencing the jury. I'll admit it. I tricked you. He's been here for a while. He was exactly on time. Is he in the restaurant? At this table even. What's that? -He's at this table. Do you mean that... -Yes. Am I dreaming or do you really want to marry me? Only if you agree. Careful, I might say yes. Say yes then. I can't. I'd want to but... I have to make a phone call... right away. I have to tell my dad. I'm very happy. I don't show it, because I'm surprised. But I'm very happy. Mr Duvivier. -That's me. Will you accept my daughter as your daughter-in-law? Why do you say that? You're son's having dinner with my daughter and she's proposing to him. Your daughter? -Yes. And your son's about to call me and ask my permission. And you want my permission? Is your daughter a serious girl? Your daughter was going to introduce me to her fianc? tonight. The problem is that I'm the fianc?. You're both adults, so do what you want. Aren't you surprised? -Of course, I'm surprised. Very surprised even. And I only have one daughter. Alright. Talk to you later. Do you know where she went? -Maybe to the ladies. I'll close. What are you doing here? -And you? That's my hat. Are you alone? Where's Victoria? -I thought she'd be here. Isn't she here? -No. Weren't you having dinner together? Yes, we had started. Didn't she ask you to marry her? -Yes, You knew about it? Everyone did. -I only heard about it tonight. It's crazy. I've always been a bit crazy. And you live here? -Yes, it's a bit like a circus. And you let me marry a clown? Don't you like him? -Yes. I liked him for what you made him do. -What he did was the hardest thing. And you didn't make a mistake. Did you have fun the past two years? That's hard with so many memories. -Why then? I wanted to take a shortcut, but I got lost. What do we do now? -Find him quickly. And call me. Where is she? -She left again. Can I talk to you? -Go ahead. No, not here. Not here anymore. Was this it? -Yes. Are you sure? -Yes. Now she knows. -Listen. I'm not listening. I'll get worked up when I want. It's over. Finished. Now I want to say something. You listen to me for a change. Do you know what you are? A spoiled child that breaks its toys. Your wives... your children, your company. And now you're destroying me, but you won't succeed. You taught me to be strong. What are you thinking? That you're the only one who dares stand in front of a lion? Come on. Do you think you're the only one who dares stand in front of a lion? He's learning fast. -He's getting there. He's doing well. Dad, it's me. He's not in the caravan, not in the office. He's nowhere. He'll be back. In a bad mood, but he'll be back. Call me when he arrives. Talk to you later. Some days, I don't understand... Shall we have a drink? He's still not here. I was in the caravan all this time. He'll be there. -It's almost five. Did you call him in his car? Do that and call me back. Don't talk to anyone. -I promise. Bye. I love you, dad. Where's that asshole? Al, what are you doing? Where are you? I'm in Thoiry. The African part. I want to ask you a very important question. He called. He arrived. Do you think we can make him come back one day? He gave me this, just before he left. He always carried this with him. LOOK AFTER HIM. I BEG YOU. LOOK AFTER HIM. I BEG YOU. -He's at his final destination now. Did your father say that? -Yes. Sam we're going home. Get up, mummy. We won't get separated anymore. Do I have to run you over?
