Yes, handsome... Yes, darling... S�, c�rrete. S�. Yes, handsome, go away. Ah, s... Ah, s... Yes, handsome, yes. Yes, handsome, go away. C�rrete, cari�o. C�rrete, �no? Go away... Run to pick up the phone. Everything has to be done running! One moment... I'm coming. �D�game? �Qui�n es? Annoying, Aldara? What's up... who am I talking to? What do you mean who are you talking to?! Cavagnaro. Ah Cavagnaro. But are these hours to call? - I'm not in the office. - You have to leave immediately. A regional councilor of the Christian Democrats has committed suicide. Let's state the facts, look at possible speculations and the usual stuff. The usual things, for whom, Cavagnaro? I am a ministry official who is dedicated to paperwork. I am not a police commissioner. That's why someone like you is needed. No one has to know that you are going to investigate. - You go to your city. - And that? It is an opportunity to see friends. You will have a family, right? Look, I have no relatives or friends. Besides, I'm not interested in going to my city. - Who has died? - A certain Bonfigli. - Bonfigli, �qu�? - Cesare Bonfigli. Businessman, 47 years old. Voy. I'm very curious. Let me guess... What do you do? To go fucking = NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN = Sorry... Where is this now, wasn't there a hotel before? Yes, last night it was still there. Then it won't be hard for me to find him. - Gracias. - Se�or... - Yes? - You are not from here. Yes, but I haven't been here for twenty years. �Veinte a�os! And how has he resisted twenty years? The first five minutes were terrible. Then I got used to it. - Looking for a hotel? - Yes. S�game. Where will you go, wretch! �Adi�s! You've been lucky to find a room at this hour. S�. She has just been released by chance. Ah, what luck! - This, is it the bathroom? - Do you know what time it is? I was already sleeping. Are you passing through or are you going to stay for a while? I hope to be here as little as possible. - Are you here on business? - Huh? Yes... In a sense. Excuse me. "Bonfigli, Sociedad Antónima". However... Have they moved the offices to the city? They have not wasted time. Now they are the owners of half the city. Ah, �s�? But, one of the brothers... hasn't he died recently? S�, Cesare. Just the only one who didn't hurt anyone. He dedicated himself only to hunting butterflies. Butterflies wouldn't agree... in that he did not hurt anyone. - Do you want anything else tonight? - No, thanks. Bueno, s�. Excuse me... do you sleep with the clients? only sometimes. Not tonight. I'm tired. What does "only sometimes" mean? It means "whenever I feel like it". When it suits me. - And me, do you feel like it? - No. - But it could suit me. - Understood. A bell for the waiter. And for you? Two rings. Twenty thousand. Good morning. Did you sleep well? This is for you. Of a woman. "Dear Mario: I know you're in town. If you still remember me, I would like to greet you. Vivian." You have come for Bonfigli's death, haven't you? He fell through that window. It was his office. I always saw it from here. But I don't understand those who jump out the window. - �Az�car? - No. I would prefer to cut my wrists, and you? Die of old Do we measure, Sergeant? Mide, mide. 1,69. - Make it 70. - Make it 70. Now go upstairs... You look out the window, throw the meter and see how high it is. At your command. Hey you! Let it circulate! Circle, circle. �Cu�nto es? �8,68! Let's round up... Nine meters. You can go down! - He must have died from the blow, huh? - Yes, sir. Excuse me, who are you? I do not get it. I had never seen him around here. The truth is that I left a long time ago. He lived there opposite, two hundred meters away. Are you doing the research for the judge? S�, se�or. Excuse me, you...? �Ah! Have you come for...? Yes, I have come for. It is clear that it was a suicide, but I prefer to let it pass as an accident. You will understand usted. Cesare Bonfigli was a Christian Democrat. A political accident then? Let's say religious. Is it that the Christian Democrats cannot get out of the way of their own free will? A little push is always needed. Or without push... But the Christian Democrats never open the window and... patapum! Si caen, caen as... "for accident". - Shall I explain? - Yes, but... To make "patapum" there always has to be a reason. Please, we all have a good reason! I... Corporal Martuccelli... Right, Martucc? Yes, my sergeant! Maybe even yourself, sheriff. No, I'm not a commissioner. Also, I am against the death penalty and against suicide. I wouldn't throw myself from a bass. Anyway, he's here for an investigation. Officious. I would even say secret. And so it should continue to be. Has the forensic report been done yet? He has to come. As soon as I do, I'll send it to you. You see, Cesare Bonfigli was very well known in the city. He was held in great esteem. - And his wife? - Viviana Bonfigli? The richest, most beautiful, sweetest and most charitable woman in town. You should know her to understand. I fully understand, Sergeant. - So everything is clear, huh? - Very clear, believe me. And allow me some advice... Now you turn around, see old friends... Do not pay attention to everything that is said... What can you do! Nothing ever happens here and when it does, suspicion is like a party game. I suspect you, you suspect me... Fucking gossips, visionaries and maledicentes! Look, look at this... Anonymous letters. Scoundrels that do not sign! Thirty will come to me a day. Martuccelli, how many letters arrive? Thirty a day, my sergeant. What was I saying, commissioner! - How much do you need? - Ten thousand lire. - When do you return them to me? - When I receive the pension. �Ah! How lucky you are that you are retired. But you give me the interest now. Out of ten thousand, two thousand. - It's okay. - Let's see... Yes. Twenty percent, bank interest. What do you give me in return? - This little ring. - Let's see. D�melo, dame. - Wait a minute, it's a memory. - And I give you ten thousand lire. Beat well! So if you don't bring me the money in a month, I'll keep the ring. But you need the money, huh? D�melo. Hey! Have they arrived? - Good luck! I've been scared... - Beware of the kids. Better a pill today than a son of a bitch tomorrow. Are you Mario Aldara? And you are Cec. You have come to control the widow. I haven't remembered her for twenty years. You do well. If you cared about her, you would be a fool. - What are you doing here? - It's a secret. And you know it, huh? Everyone already knows. Tell me, Cec... Do you know anything about this little craft? "Cesare Bonfigli ha sido asesinado, no se ha matado." It's not my thing. No, I'm not saying that you did it. No... But don't you think that instead of a suicide it could be... a homicide? Everything is possible. �Y qui�n podr�a...? Who is interested in that...? - He said. - Don't be an idiot. Wasn't he the one who took away the girl you wanted to marry? I could have killed him twenty years ago. They are news that always cheer up. Sit at the door of your house and you will see the corpse of your enemy pass by. Hey, it's been twenty years since you invited me to drink something. It's true, sorry. - Only a thousand lire? - You won't pretend the delays? If you go to the Bonfigli's to offer your condolences, you have them all there. - What do you want? - Is Mrs. Bonfigli at home? Come in please. Excuse me, who are you? I am Aldara, ma'am. And what do you want from me? Nothing from you. I would like to see Viviane. Ah, my daughter-in-law! Let's see if he can find her. I never see her. �Mira! I have won! I know... You always win. Can you lend me ten thousand lire? Ten thousand lire? My son Marcelo. What are we going to do to him? I realize. I want gold and they come out coarse. I will have to accept it. Anyway, the boys are in the pool. Except Cesare, of course. I take this opportunity to express my deepest condolences. Thank you. Wow, wow. Are you always this happy? Or only in case of misfortune? No s�. If the libero is not unmarked, we will always play with one less man in midfield, right, Pel? Hey! Overall, you don't know anything. Here comes someone who sounds familiar to me. Am I right, sir...? - But you are Mario Aldara! - Hello, Peter. - Viviana is not here. - I know. But I wanted to come to offer my condolences for your brother. - And have you come from Rome? - No. No, no a prop�sito. But I know that your brother was a very important character. Who is it? The commissioner who has come from Rome? - I'm not a commissioner. - Don't you remember Mario Aldara? At school I always passed my homework. - Do you remember my sister? - Oh, yes. Good morning. This is Patrizia, my girlfriend. Hello. We've already seen each other. I didn't know you knew Pietro. Yes, we went to school together. �Se�or! Sir, shall I make one for you too? I invented it, you know? I call it "Bitch Cocktail." As I was telling you... Increasing the discount rate to reduce inflation seems like shit to me. S�, padre. - Is it your daughter? - Does she look like a daughter? �Qu� calor, eh! I suppose that Viviana will have suffered a lot. - Why? - How, why? For the death of her husband. Ah, ya... He has found solace in his charitable activities. She was always a very brave woman. In reality, he is always at work. She is the president of the Moral Entity for the Protection of Children. Now you have to let it rest for five minutes. Meanwhile I... Hale-hop! Look, do you know what happens if I put a seed in your little ass? A flower comes out of your mouth. You didn't get it, huh, Pel? - Yes. - You didn't get it, Pele. - Who is that guy? - Father Luigino. My brother has not killed himself. From that window, either it has fallen due to a misfortune or it has been thrown. How did they throw it away? Cesare has committed suicide. Shut up, idiot. You don't know anything. - Who is the idiot? - The husband of my sister. Ah, perd�n. They have thrown it out the window. They have thrown it away. Yes, okay. But who? You ask me? It is you who has to find out. Bueno... It seems to me that the only indisputable thing is that he did not go out the door. �Se�or! - Se�or... - �Yo? Are you the official they sent from Rome? - Yes. - Well, it doesn't look like it at all. What will it have to do with it? - You are a friar. - Yes, why? It does not seem... Such is life. He's a civil servant... and an asshole. Girls... Sector Aldara! Mr. Aldara, I have something for you. Just photocopied from the judge's secretary. I mean... "Male body. Apparent age: 45 years. Capillary system with de... normal development." Yes, it means that the hair is where it should be. "Head. Incised wound in the parietal-temporal region with respect to the long axis of the body. No bony lesion in the cranial box"... Head. "Multiple fractures in the spine. Fourth, fifth and sixth dorsal. fourth lumbar Pelvic fracture." It is clear, there is no doubt... It is suicide. Excuse me, sergeant, but where do you get that it's a suicide? Only a suicide man lands on his feet. When it reaches the bottom, it breaks from the waist down. Look, look at this... Adem�s hay... "Legs, arms, fractured spine." No doubt. And this wound without fracture... - Where? - In the head. Aqu�... Mire. Aqu� places it. "The wound was cut in the parietal-temporal region with respect to the major axis... of the body." And that's a blow to the head? I feel sorry for you, but that says there... "In the head". Furthermore, if he had voluntarily rushed the head would have hit the same as the body and it would have split open like... like a watermelon. Realize that Cesare Bonfigli had a very hard head. Less than yours, sergeant. Well, if it's hard, it means that I don't have it empty. The Viviana Bonfigli sector, please? Come in please. It is waiting for you. Hello. You have made yourself wait. I am the one who expected to see you. Si�ntate. "Tenacity". El... The same perfume. Is for you. Really? �Qu� extra�o! It's like... life has stopped. Culpa m�a. Bueno... I wanted to tell you that during your investigation... terminar�s encontr�ndome a m�. I guess you already figured it out. Are you not going to tell me that you... that you have killed your husband? Oh no, it wasn't that. I wanted to say that... Nerd. Do you want an answer? No. Better not. The first months... you did nothing but cry. Now I also want to cry. Qu� tonter�a, �no? Is not true. Lo s�. If I say anything now it would seem that... You better not say anything. If you want revenge... The best revenge is forgiveness. - Will you forgive me then? - No. Because I don't want revenge. You have the wrong car. No, I was waiting for you. here we are Sorry. Don't you like music? Yes, but only with the car running. Then we can boot and go. �Ir ad�nde? �Para qu�? No s�. Good. Oye... Have you seen the dollar today? No. What happened to him? - Keep going up. - Oh, yeah? Not to be curious... But who cares about the dollar! Who cares about the dollar? It's like saying you don't give a damn about your parents. What are you going to think about at night before you fall asleep? - In the Italian lira? - Nerd. The Ministry of Finance is not concerned, why should you be concerned? Do you know why I marry Pietro? I imagine to put her slippers on after the wedding. - It won't be for money. - No. To plant it after six months and get alimony. So we could say that Pietro is on the brink of marriage. And what are your projects for the future? When she grows up, she will be an actress. I want to make my own "march to Rome"... With enough money that I don't have to go to bed with the first producer to show up. In other words, in order not to sleep with the first producer you sleep with the first idiot. �Muy bien! "Biacebo". It's from Bonfigli. Here is everything from Bonfigli. "A house in nature". - Biacebo, what does it mean? - Bianca and Cesare Bonfigli. And Pietro, isn't he here? No, he is interested in other things. They don't speak very well of you. Oh yeah? What do they say, let's see? That you're still in love with Viviana. �Yo? Ah, why did you see me come out of that portal? No, I've gone to... talk business. That's why I liked you at the first glance. It is difficult to find today a man so clinging to his youthful love. �Tan extraordinarily romantic! - So formidably... - Asshole. S�. No problem. The interest is still there. Come on, I'm an old-fashioned man. You are right. What are you doing? Do you pay court to an old man? How have you found Viviana? - In shape? - Yes, very good. - �Guapa? - �Buf! - �Joven? - �Ya vale! Forgives. I have found her like twenty years ago. Same, identical. We bet you're wrong? The office is closed. For. Mira, todav�a est�. MORAL ENTITY FOR THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN - Are you crazy? Needless. - Forgives... If not, the fun is over. What are you doing? You know that this is a crime. - It doesn't matter. I'm with a cop. - I'm not a cop. - I am a government employee. - That's it. "Look for the woman". "Look for the woman", �d�nde? - Under the table? - It's not his favorite place. There may be a trap door. No other thing. �Listo! Here is your Viviana... and here is the truth. But I have come to look for another truth. Ah, so you fooled me. Yes, I cheated on you. But I'm not interested. Are you going to run away? Cheer up, little fu... official. Are you making fun of me? - �Dios m�o! - �Oh! Mario... - What a surprise! - Who is it? What do you want? Ah, s�, perd�n... The architect Aldara... The architect Morlacchi. Charmed. Are you also an architect? Yes, but now he does not exercise. He's here for an investigation. Ah, a policeman. It doesn't look like it from the looks of it. Don't worry. I'm not anti vice. And what do I care! Good for you. - Do you want a whiskey? - Yes, thanks. And you, Mario, if I remember correctly, you drank it with ice. If I remember correctly, we only put ice in the lemonade. A cigarette? - No, thanks. - No compliments. Look what... later is the best. Or is it that I have arrived before? Then... Better that it had not arrived. Gracias. What will you think of me now? Nothing compared to what I have to think of myself. Yes, I know, today a naked woman means nothing. But I'm old-fashioned. I must say that you are still wonderfully plated. �Qu� rico! Besides, that way you don't commit yourself to mourning, don't you think? - Why? - Where did you...? How clueless I am! - Is it a reproach? - Nerd. �Sabes...? Any death causes a certain effect, but nothing more. Besides, a husband like Cesare... why? What was special about Cesare? Listen... If you would be so kind... Excuse me, I'm talking to a lady. Very good, but if we can finish... Pleasure. What do you want us to do? Do you get dressed or do I get undressed? Yes, but do you have to question the lady right now? It is that I do not have to speak only with the lady. I would also like to chat a little with you. - �Conmigo? - S�. And what have I to do with this suicide? Who says it was a suicide? What if it was a homicide? ��Homicidio?! - Did I hear correctly? - You heard perfectly. It seems absurd to me, but I am at your disposal. Well, let's not exaggerate. In any case, if in an hour you can be at Caf� Central... We can have an aperitif together. If I don't recognize you dressed, give me a sign. �What�? �What� of what�? The cigarette. - Good. - I told him. Despu�s. Come out! I left you, you were a child and now... that I see you again after twenty years... A real whore! - How beautiful! -And when he slept with me, what was it? A bride who was going to get married. �Vaya imb�cil! Men, always the same. If she sleeps with me, "she makes love", if she does it with another, "she gets fucked". Try to remember... We never slept. We always did it in the car, don't you remember? - It was pretty, wasn't it? - Nice but uncomfortable. But nice. How strange! And to think that even... that until ten minutes ago I had never seen you completely naked. Did you like me? - No. - But you were looking at me. so what? Even though he's pissed off, I can always appreciate a nice ass. I'm talking about yours, naturally. Come out! In bed with a man three days after your husband's death. Naked... Without even a black bracelet. At least a little respect for the one who has done you the favor of leaving you a widow. It bothers you that I tell you, doesn't it? "C'est la vie", querida! Because of this head of hair, men do not reason. The Pope, the king, the presidents, are not worth a damn. This one is called Rosa and she is very beautiful. Have you got a hard-on? - Leave me! - I'm not going to eat you! At your age, the dick is like a puppy. He has to play, otherwise he weakens. - Leave me! - These guys today... �Eh! Sergeant Badaloni, have you confessed? �Who holds a sargento de "carabinieri" to confess? That he is in love with Viviana. And a sergeant in love... You may forget some tests. What, for example? Two woman's hair... in the jacket of the corpse. But what kind of commissioner are you? See that the suspect in the crime has also been you. �Yo? �Sospechoso? I don't know anything. For me that one has not even died. Some cigarettes? Only two? Of the... - Architect... - Ah! Do you see how he recognized me? Yes, he has his fly open. In what sense? Well assumptions... - I don't know, suspects... - And what do I have to do with that? Who is more suspicious than the lover of...? - Yes, but why? - For... To regularize your situation. To marry... What nonsense! You see, commissioner... I don't know if you will remember a cartoon by Novello... There is a gentleman sitting in the tram with an open newspaper in his hands. He is stupefied by a piece of news that he has just read. He has a terrible face, he's all sweaty, and the foot says... "Mr. Rossi has read in the newspaper that his lover's husband has died." �Qu� bueno! - So what? - "So what?" I am Mr. Rossi. Good. Se�or Rossi... From architect to architect, in confidence... Where were you on Saturday afternoon? - Yeah, but that's not... - Yes, this is precisely what is fundamental. Okay. Saturday afternoon... I was in Milan, at the Sporting Club. But let me tell you that when talking about suicide you have to start with the motive. I've learned it from you, haven't I? And now, man to man, I will ask you something... What interest could I have, eh? Look, man to man... - Can I? - Clear. Do you love Viviana? Yes, sure. But I would never have killed for love. No, no, okay. And the husband, that is, the deceased... did you know of their relationship? Of course not. He was passionate about butterflies. Besides, how could he suspect a woman like Viviana? And from a friend like you. - Because you were friends, right? - My best friend. - Father Luigino introduced him to me. - Ah, Father Luigino... Yes, when the project "A house in nature" was made. I designed it, you know? And from there a great sympathy was born. - Not for him, of course. - No, sure. But he was always very kind to me. If you want to stay calm, why don't you ask him? Father Luigi is charming. LET'S KEEP OUR CITY CLEAN Here is the House of the Child. All credit belongs to Father Luigi. Because it was he who managed to get the town hall to reclassify the pine forest. The pine forest where the Indians were going to play? Exactly. You should see it... There's not a pine tree left. Smooth as a board. There was some reluctance, but Father Luigi managed to appease them. He got asphalt, telephone, electricity, water... Everything from the town hall. - Free. -Of course, Cesare Bonfigli, may the Lord have in glory, He gave him his unconditional support from the beginning. - This one is closed. - Okay... I took the thing to the town hall, to the deputation... He also fought there. And in the end, he even got expropriation. - How much? - I don't know that. But it was for a highly meritorious, charitable cause. The House of the Abandoned Child. - Does this face the patio? - Yes. Two thousand beds. All rooms with bathroom and telephone. Big time! Children abandoned by wealthy parents. Yes, of the entire region. There is an agreement between Father Luigi and the region. In times, the poor kids were scattered. And instead, now... They are still scattered waiting for... - That. - Yes, a huge job. Mrs. Viviana, a great woman, dedicates all her time to him. Well, everything everything, I wouldn't say. - That is the suicide window. - It's the only one. Instead, there are three doors. One, two and three. - For one of them he had to leave. - Who, the dead one? Yes... The murderer, right? The killer? Commissar... Look, the examining magistrate is about to close the case... - What are you going to do? - Sergeant... I already explained it to you again... I am here unofficially. I am a normal citizen who takes care of things... personal. How strange! This is from Saturday, 18. - Father's school would go here... - Father Luigi's. No, this is different. This is a great urban operation. "A house in nature". It starts here and ends in motocross. - Exactly. - 400 thousand meters. Bueno... - All of Bonfigli? - Nerd. - De la Biacebo, a limited company. - Swiss. But a famous architect from Milan, a certain... - The architect Morlacchi. - �Huh? - Put it there. - Do you know him? Yes, a lot. Naked and dressed. A great friend of the Bonfigli... But you, sergeant, have forgotten of the two hairs found on the victim's body. And you, how do you know? - I'm here to know, right? - And you don't tell me anything? It is you who have to tell me, love. It has come before. Two communists with long hair, commissar. What do you want them to be? Do they seem like a clue? They could be his wife's. Or doña Bianca. Everyone in the family has long hair. And they have every right to hug. Estos Bonfigli! An absurd family. Bianca, for example... It could be everything. What do you know about her? No. The robe, please. Has the lady been satisfied? It seems to me that I already made it clear that I don't like this one. One by one. Today she was his turn. Too fast. He fucks like a husband. - Do you see? She is not satisfied. - I always look like the ass. - Here you have the 30 thousand. - Thank you. - Would you like another one, ma'am? - Long long. Don't make noise. I'll let you know. When we get back, I'll bring the rope, ma'am. That's how we tied her to the bed, like the other time she had so much fun. Long. We'll talk on the phone. There you have it... this is Bianca Bonfigli. Vaya... Also she has long hair. It could be a clue. If you want, I'll give you a real clue. S�, d�mela. Have you ever wondered why the Bonfiglis insist so much that it wasn't a suicide? I know I've wondered. And I will tell you that his behavior is quite strange. It is throwing stones against your own roof. Could be. It is a calculated risk. �S�? - Do you know why? - Why? - Because of the insurance. - Already. If Cesare had committed suicide, the billions of insurance would fly. And rather than let them escape, they are able to send their mother to jail. Or the idiot brother. What I don't understand is what need they have for money. - They are the owners of Mulini Bonfigli. - And collecting unemployment. What a strange city! Everyone knows everything about everyone. The only one who doesn't know anything is Sergeant Badaloni. Well, I'll tell you something else and that's it, okay? Vale. Badaloni is in love with Viviana. Everyone knows that too. - Badaloni? - It's over and over. Pacts are pacts. S�. So, if you have nothing more to tell me... I don't see any reason to continue here. V�monos. Please... What are you doing? Have you gone crazy? Viviana, huh? you do. Always Vivian. It still burns you. And what the hell does it matter to you! Every time you don't want to commit... Thank you, "cher" Viviana. S�. Does it seem so strange to you? Viviana, yes. Touch touch. - It's been twenty years since... - Touching won't hurt. - Does it hurt? - Don't be a girl, leave it now. Come, give it to me. what do you want? No no no... No, you're not going to be t... �Qui�n es? - �Eh? - �Qui�n es? No... It has only been a sensation. Who is watching us? - �D�nde? - All�, mira. And give a And... And give a. - Are you afraid? - Me? No. Adem�s, deber�a and, �no? - Cec�. - �Auxilio! - Get out! - Can't you look a little bit? He was looking with only one eye! - Rosa. - �S�? - Can you bring me a bottle of mineral water? - Yes. To the room. I'm going now. Is it possible? And the mineral water? Everything a client asks for... after midnight means... "take off your panties". And if you don't feel like it? When I don't feel like it, I bring the mineral water. �Pobre don Cesare! And to think I almost saw him fall. �C�mo? Did you see something that Saturday and you haven't told me anything? I was resting for a moment. I saw don Cesare in the window... with the architect Morlacchi. �With the architect Morlacchi? Are you sure you saw it? �Claro! They were alone in the entire building. Well, what are you doing? Has she given you an air? �Eh? No. Now I don't value myself, but when I was young I was worth much more. Val�a m�s. I started on this very early. At twelve, they gave me half a million. It was the first time, but it was a lot of money. Half a million... A lot for a girl. I meant... monstrous. A hobby, manic. Of course not everyone is like you, you can see that you are a clean person. Do you mind if we make love like this? Well, you have experience. You started early. I've been raped. And then they put the money in my hand. Giving me the whore's license when I was only... twelve years old. I was still going to school. At twelve? �Terrible! You, at that age, what were you like? �Guapita? Were you already developed? She was naive, like the other girls. He still played with dolls. Really? How beautiful! Of course, the juvenile market has its clientele. S�. Fine. Congratulations. You think of me and make love to others. What's up? Has she given you an air? What an unpleasant scene! Leave. Now bring me the real mineral water. Yes, but I'll send it to you with the waiter. One two Three... Of the blessed, Mother, To the cry of faith. We want God who is our Father, We want God who is our King. We want God who is our Father, We want God who is our King. We love God, Virgin Mary, Benigna listen to our cry... They are all children of Father Luigi! - �Esos? - S�. Ah, they wear foreboding uniforms. �Bah! Of the blessed, Mother, To the cry of faith. We want God who is our Father, We want God who is our King. We want God who is our Father, We want God who is our King. Thank you. He doesn't deserve it. How I like Father Luigi! He is handsome as a saint. These ceremonies always move me. Los ni�os... Thanks thanks. It's that they are very good. Thanks thanks. And now that we've already said thank you, there's a little surprise for you. Everybody around here... Take your finger out of your nose! Come on, let's go! Slow down, slow down! �Despacio! �En fila! Divine providence. Through generosity and self-sacrifice of all these very good ladies of this pious city, right? They have prepared a tombola for you, where... without paying, all of you will have a prize. - I want the gun! - Don't touch your balls, and shut up. Go ahead, children. Come all without making a scandal. Portaos bien. Sin esc�ndalos. "Voil�". Quiet, quiet, slowly, slowly, no scandals... �C�llate! - Ready, sergeant? - At your service. Don't break the wheel like last year, huh. As you are watching, spin the wheel and the arrow will stop on the winning number. - �Qu� n�mero saldr�? - �El 32! �Silencio! And the cake? When do we eat the cake? - I want candy. - Later. Now it's the little orphans' party. I don't want "The life of Santa Úrsula and the ten thousand virgins", like last year. - Shut up, or I'll give you the stamp too. - I don't give a damn about the stamp! �Silencio! 37. �37! Too hard, sergeant. The tone is softer. The same thing always happens to me, ma'am. It makes me hard. �37! Who has 37? - Then give it to me. - The what? The 37. - �Ah! - �37! Who has 37? 37... - �Yo! - "Voil�!" He has it. Go collect the prize. Be good. - If not, then I'll take it from you. - A wonderful doll. And what do I do with this? It's not even a blow up doll. Ouch! Excuse me, sergeant. Go back to your site. - Architect Morlacchi. - Ah! - Sorry. - Yes. - I have interrupted your sin of gluttony. - Yes. - But you lied to me. - Me? Two sins. If Father Luigino finds out... What did I say? Yes, it may have been a mix-up. You mentioned a "Sporting Club" on Saturday afternoon. But on Saturday afternoon you were at the window... - With poor Cesare. - Let's see... Let me explain. It took me by surprise. I didn't think it was a crime. I was afraid. I immediately returned to the hotel and Father Luigino spoke to Cesare after I had left. It was after five. Check it out. - This complicates things. - Do you think? For me, it clarifies them. For you, not for me. Because I had gotten into my head that... - That you are the murderer. - It's not possible! It was a fixed idea. And I'm sorry because I like you. - Understood. - For the victims of abortion! A pence in conscience. Thank you, Mrs. Pantaloni. Thanks, Rupert. From you I would accept even Swiss francs. Do you know that it takes me an hour to get there with my Lamborghini? - And to leave? - Even less. A donation for the victims of abortion. I'm sorry, but I am in favor of abortion. A donation, gentlemen... The yacht on the Emerald Coast, some Christmas in Acapulco... Always by jet. And when there was no time, a weekend in Cortina. That has been my life. Always the same faces. A tin. I, on the other hand, can't complain. I have had a brilliant life. Fifteen years in the ministry. Eight hours of work a day. Not very tiring either. Dinner in the tavern and, naturally, later television. No women? - Only whores. Oh. And you, only architects. Oh no. You still continue with that story. It still disgusts you. I thought I was the only architect of your life. �T�? Enti�ndelo. Cesare... Caesar is understandable. Besides, he bought you. It's fair. I was far away, I was poor... He was close and he was rich. You are nobody. You can't even imagine who Cesare was. Business and butterflies. �Mariposas? Butterflies. Ten thousand butterflies has left me. All cataloged and labeled. - If you want to see them, you can come home. - Nerd... What I don't understand is what the ten thousand butterflies have to do with Morlacchi. It's easy to explain. He/she spent the nights with the butterflies. Except Christmas Eve, which he dedicated to me. Nineteen years of marriage! And nineteen Christmas Eve... Now you will understand Morlacchi. Above all, I understand you. I don't deserve your irony. I've always thought of you, you know? I too have always thought of you... while sleeping with the others. Not at all. Not at all. Look at this. He has a fatal fall. It must be perfect because it is not true that the habit does not make the monk. I finish here and I am with you. Good. Now look behind... It suits me well. But I don't like the front length because I would like it to be... six inches above, so that the booties could be seen. Stay there on your knees and see if the loot is visible when you walk. �Se and? �Se and your hand boots? - From there, can you see it? - Yes, it can be seen. Well, take that measure, which is perfect. Come on, mark there. Very good perfect. Caterina! - Voy! - Come, come. Of est�. �Se acab�! My robe... Very good, thank you. Comb... - Enc�rgate. - S�, padre. I'm with you now, brother. Just ask for an information... The arquitecto Morlacchi cont� me... what Bonfigli... I received a call from him the day he died. S�, s�. Saturday, right? After five. Nerd. - Before you said yes. - Yes, because of the call. - And then no. - Yes, I say yes for the call. But before five, because at five I was already on the highway. In other words, you spoke with Cesare Bonfigli... Before or after Morlacchi left? Eh... hello? Yes, it's me. Yes, tell me, brother. Tell me... No, I don't pay anything, okay? How do we decide...? The truth... What did Morlacchi say? No, it is you who has to tell me what he said... �Caterina! �Le apetece un "bloody mary"? At this time the throat is dry. Caterina, the usual! �Voy! �Entonces...? In fact... The call to poor Cesare Bonfigli came before five. And Morlacchi was there with him, I think. - Do you believe or are you sure? - Okay... I guess so. I could be wrong, but... I had the feeling that they were talking. - Yours, also with pepper? - No, thanks. - The pepper, right? - Yes. Those plump and grumpy old women... are no more. - I wish! - You have to settle. You already see that you are satisfied. In addition, the one who is not consoled is because he does not want to. have. You are wrong. It was a suicide. It is true that I gave absolution to the corpse, but... What the fuck! God understands these things. And health. And if he doesn't understand... What the hell, you explain it to him! Health. I sit here. As que el d�a de la desgracia, Cesare Bonfigli was with Morlacchi. S�. I was in room 12. I was there for a mineral water. I saw the two of them in the window opposite. - �Discut�an? - No. They seemed in a good mood. Also later, when the architect came out. Did you see him leave? Yes, from 27. - Another mineral water? - Yes, but he really loved her. And naturally, Bonfigli, at that moment... he was still alive. I saw it in the window. He was with a butterfly. Se ha portado bien Morlacchi. �Ad�nde vas? - I have to go. - Where? - He's waiting for me. - Who? -My boyfriend. You take free mineral water to him, eh? What are you doing here? Any. I have come to look for Rosa. - Ah. - �Y t�? To look for you Shall we have a glass of champagne? What are you doing now? Charge a percentage of the drinks? - Do you think I alternate? - Man, in this environment... - So, is it an anniversary? - No. I don't like champagne. Let's drink two orangeades. �Ah� va, 1968! I haven't had an orangeade since 1968. Have sweet deeds. Then I lost my virginity. Two orangeades, please. �Quieres? Ah, this is better than orangeade, you know? - I know another, you know? - The one in the bar under the hotel? - No. - Ah yes, Ferreti. Also...? All twelve years old? - Month more, month less. - And who is the seducer? - Don't you know? - No. - Pietro... Everyone here knows it. - Pietro? - Baby. - No. And everyone knows what Pietro is and no one tells? S�. Mira... - Do you see that one? there! - Where? She too is a victim of Pietro. That one over there? So plump? It's not possible. At twelve years old? - He had less, but... - It's not possible. - And look there. Do you see the one who dances? - Where? Come on, look. - that? - Yes, but he is waiting for it to grow up. It's all a matter of price. But, why don't all these minors meet in an association? They could get a discount at the movies. Like a faithful animal. Stupid but faithful. Do you realize? Twenty years ago Viviana left me and I don't give a damn. - Yes, but don't stop. - No, that's not true. I care a lot, a lot. Imagine that in these twenty years, I will not have betrayed Viviana more than two or three times... a week. - Come on, walk. - But only with whores. Only with professionals. I have never betrayed her with another woman, only whores. And every time I went with one of them... - Do you know what he did? - No. First he made love, then he took out the money, I would put it in his hand and tell him... "Toma... Viviana". That's why your Viviana has the money she has in Switzerland. - Do not leave Me. - No. If you leave me alone, do you know what I will do? When I go with a whore, I will pay her and say... Where do you have the car keys? I don't know. Look in the jacket. What are you doing? Nerd. Go with your excuse to play the flute for me. Aqu� est�n. Do you know what you are going to do? - You're going to be a good girl. - Yes. You take me in your arms, you take me to the hotel... and you leave me in my room. So I ring the bell and call... Rosa. Since I'm not a good girl... I'm going to take you in my arms, take you to my house and sleep with you. I only sleep with... whores. Exactly. I am the most whore of all. Is it possible? Nice apartment... - Come on up. - It has the same amenities ...from my house. - Really? - Remember that I will pay you before. - Yeah, okay. You can't see anything here! Do you see better now? So I wear the black stockings? �D�nde est�n? They had to be here. - Will you make me a gift? - Of course. - I can't find them. We do it without them... -Yes, without them. In fact, let's put it all off for tomorrow. - I'm afraid to be here. - Where are you escaping? - �Socorro! - �nimo, cari�o. It is a moment that passes immediately. - Come on, it's nothing. - And if Pietro finds out? - We won't tell him anything. - And if Viviana finds out? We won't tell her anything either. Let's go. �Qu� verg�enza! Do you know that every time I make love, Viviana ends up finding out? Forget about Viviana! Yes, you are right. Who cares about Viviana! We're going to do something... As�. As� no nos ve. And now you undress me? First you have to make things clear. And if I fall in love with you later, what happens? - So much the worse. - No, he reasons, I tell you I can't. It's just... I can't. It's like I've made a vow. But if you provoke me like that... No, you shouldn't... D�jalo... To know what you will think of me... But you're not a bitch... do you think? And why? You're just a perfect imitation. Clear. This time you can't deny it. you have deceived me I hoped you didn't see me. I even turned the chair. And now what do you do? Change the subject? I shit on the bitch! Have you hurt yourself? Unfortunately Morlacchi has a firm alibi. It couldn't have been him. But we will follow another track. - This. - Ok. On Saturday afternoon the deceased signed a check and gave it to someone. I think a relative. But this someone can't bring himself to admit it. Why?... - That. why? - How, why? Because it would be like admitting the crime. You have to find who cashed the check. - Good morning, Piero. - Good morning, Father Luigi. You are to discount. You are to collect... Be careful, don't mess everything up for me like last time. It is to renew. He's at the orphans' residence... Here three letters: this one to collect tomorrow, It is currently stopped, and if they don't pay for it, protest it. And all this, to my private account. This too. Wait a minute... I keep this for tobacco. I'm sorry, but that check hasn't cleared yet. Now I understand everything! Do you know that now I am the one who does not understand anything? So what do you want to know? What if I have already passed menopause? No, I just wanted to know about your children. No, for God's sake, don't say you found me here. They don't want me to play. They have even incapacitated me. What a joke. But do they give you support? to me? Not a penny In exchange, they have raised 50 hectares of land for me. To do together with that friar "A house in nature". Have you seen her? Yes. But tell me the truth �qui�n le ha tangado m�s: Pietro, Cesare or Bianca? Everybody. When it comes to tangarme, everyone always agrees. With the excuse of the game they control me even the money for the taxi. Because they say that I go on foot and I risk it in the horse races. - And maybe it's true. - Yes, it's true. The problem is that I don't have any luck. It's a problem. What could it be? - �Buscas to Patrizia? - Yes... No, you. - And are you looking for me at Patrizia's house? - I didn't know you were here... but I was going to ask her, that's why I came. You always find me in the Circle, don't you? It's just that I don't like to play. Ah hello. What a surprise. Hi... I didn't know you were still going to school. We were looking at costumes for the carnival. - Leave it. He knows about us. - Then there's no problem. Besides, we're engaged, right? This encounter calls for a Scotch on the rocks. Isn't that normal on these occasions? - Qu� down. - �El qu�? That you have incapacitated your mother. Wouldn't it be better if she incapacitated you? And what do you care? That one played 10 million a month as if it were a glass of water. Of course, of course. That is why you have reached 50 hectares of buildable land. �Nosotros? �Cesare! He has acquired my part by paying for it. In cash or does he still owe you something? No, all in cash. I was not interested. It's not a clean thing. How strange that in your family there is something unclean. Using the excuse of orphans, Father Luigi changed the management plan. And made the association buy the land for the residence at a very high price. And together with Cesare he created a financial company in Switzerland. And on that land, he made "A house in nature." - So there is no residence. - I know there is. About 10 hectares of the 50. A priest, Father Luigi. A regional councillor, poor Cesare. And his wife, Viviane. - And Bianca. - Bianca too. But how did Morlacchi get into this? It was Viviana who got Morlacchi into the business. You know, an important architect, socially positioned... untouchable. Did I know Viviana in Morlacchi? Wait, let me guess. Father Luigino introduced her. Say. Yes, it's me. Oh dear. Tell me brother. Yes, dear. No, you pay now, or if not, I'll protest the letter. I'm here, brother. Everything for you. What happens? - Can I speak clearly? - How can it? must! It's about "A house in nature." So you have misled Mrs. Bonfigli, corrupted the municipal plenary session, has speculated with a piece of land to the detriment of an association... and has diverted the fate of an orphanage to build a luxury hotel. Or am I wrong? All this has its point of view. Do you have proof, brother? No, because, unfortunately, these things are not within my competence. I only deal with the death of Cesare Bonfigli. And for your peace of mind, I will tell you that you have nothing to do with it. - You are very good, Commissioner. - I'm not a commissioner. And don't thank me. I'm not even an exemplary citizen. A Bloody Mary? At this time the throat is dry. - Caterina, the usual. - But here is something that concerns you. And as a citizen, I don't pass it on. Look, I'll read it to you how it got to me... "It also turns out that the aforementioned Father Luigi within the scope of its many charitable activities, it has also assumed the pious honor of taking care of the physical maintenance and the spiritual education of all orphans in the region, for whose commission he receives 5 thousand liras per day for each one. Unable to dispose of people, the devout friar has had to resort to subcontractors from religious institutes the parareligious, to whom you have committed to make daily income between 1,500 and 1,750 lire per capita. So you speculate on the hunger of orphans in the region for a sum ranging from 3,000 to 3,500 lire per capita. I'm going to make a call. State Attorney? Do you want to talk? Your Honor, I may have to stay sometime longer. - What is it? - Stay still. �Maleducada! Suicide must be ruled out. Not that one... Accident? I don `t believe. I will keep them long. Your Honor, my respects. See you around. �Te vas? What do you care? Hey, I have to talk to you later. Bianca takes you waiting for an hour at the hotel. - When did you say you were leaving? - I haven't talked about leaving. Do you want to keep digging through the trash looking for a homicide? where there is only an accident? - Or... a suicide. - No! A suicide, no. Accident. Maybe a homicide. As you like. I don't care. It's up to you. �M�a? �Bromea? Do you know that ten days before poor Cesare died left us all dry? All the money from various companies transferred it to Switzerland. Without saying anything to anyone. What does it mean? last stick. Goodbye inheritance. Two signatures in deposit to be able to take the money. - Yours and... - Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Let me guess. - Vivian. - Bingo. Do you realize what it means? Don't forget there are billions of insurance at stake. So, homicide or accident? Homicide. No doubt. But here you speak of the complete opposite. It says: lower body fractures. And what does it mean? Did you read correctly? There is also a wound on the temple from before the fall. But why previous? Couldn't she do it by falling? Because if he hit his head it would completely burst. In any case, the investigating judge does not think the same. He will do what he wants, he will have his reasons. But if you want my opinion, he was stunned with a not very strong blow, with the right hand. Why with the right? Because the wound is in the left parietal. And the blow was given, judging by the position of the chemification, when the victim and the murderer were face to face. - Therefore, with the right hand. - Already. Thanks man. With the right hand... But Viviana Bonfigli... ...she's left-handed. - And what does Mrs. Bonfigli have to do with it? Nothing... it was a consideration that I made. It has nothing to do with it. I have known her well for 20 years. Viviana seems like an energetic, even violent woman. - But I wouldn't hurt a fly. - Not a fly. What does it mean? 20 years ago, to marry Bonfigli made false documentation, don't you know? Not just an abortion, then he had it sutured. - 20 years ago? - At 5 months. - Did you abort her? - No, I sent her to a specialist. So abortion... - Mrs. Viviana is not here. - Who cares. - Is the rest of the family, right? - What do you do? I don't talk to you You are a newborn. Don't you realize that you've been sucking on an empty bottle since you were born? - Ah, it's you who makes so much noise. - Excuse me, I was looking for Doña Viviana. - Why do you always ask me, love? - It is true. And I never find it. - Are you still urging? - What are you going to do? - The garbage can is here. - I'm not surprised, His true vocation is that of a dumpster. Urging, urging... you always end up finding someone like you. - He ignored you, Pietro. - We went to school together. I have not said the last word to you. �Qui�n se�re? How nice. You have little left to laugh. Unfortunately for you, you will go to the residence. The faucet of money is going to close. Oh, I almost forgot. Billions left. The insurance! But the insurer doesn't pay in case of suicide, right? No, you don't pay. Of course, a disgrace would have been better. Or even a homicide. - Yes, true. and? - And I will declare that it is of a suicide. ...so you are all going to take wind. - What way of speaking is that? Sorry. Take it up the ass Buenas tardes. Shall I take you, sister? How do you manage your schedule halfway between being a nun and being a floozy? As a nun I go to the Volunteer Association for blood donation. And as a half floozy I can get in the car with you. You have nothing against it, right? I will ask you a question to your most sensitive side: - Will you sleep with me? - They don't usually ask me like that. You are right. It will change mode. In the name of our great love, will you have sex with me? You're not in the right key yet. This time you can calmly take the pill. - What do you mean? - The detail should not go unnoticed. Besides, of course I will pay you. Of course I don't have the availability of the Mulini Bonfigli ...but up to 100 thousand I can go. - Are you crazy? �Para aqu�! �Frena! I had never been treated like this. Perhaps the figure has offended you? We can do it in 200 thousand. Imb�cil... Qu� imb�cil. At the cost of you taking my blood away, here I am to end the talk. Well lie down. Go ahead, sister. Don't move, I'm sticking the needle into you. I can't reach the vein. If you keep moving ...will not be able to find the vein. - Excuse me but... ...is this the first time you've been looking for it? - It's nothing, calm down. Do you remember when you wanted to leave me but you didn't know how? If you go on like this, I won't be able to find your vein. But try to find her, please. - "Voil�". - �La encontraste? Why does it hurt afterwards? There are ways and ways to leave a relationship. In fact, they did nothing but cry. Were you crying maybe because your belly hurt? - Who told you that? - A certain Moroni. Gynecologist. It is impossible that you do not know him. As for not, you will have needed it on occasion or other. But what do you want now? why do you come to me to touch noses 20 years later? What's wrong with you? What right do you have over me, my life, my loves or my abortions? I've been too good to you! - And I'm starting to get fed up! - Are you going to get me another liter? - It's good for you, it calms you down. - But if you're bleeding me dry... ...my daughter! - No... - Why not? - Calm. - I came to talk to you. Listen, I have no strength left. I feel cold feet. - Yes, dear, why not... - You're bad. I know why you left me 20 years ago. - Do you want me to tell you? - Ok. Because I was stuttering. Because of my slight pronunciation defect. You couldn't bear it. But you had a few other flaws. - Don't you think you have flaws? - Yes, yes. I agree. Calm... You keep drawing blood from me... I should kill you. Right away. Ok. Understand... What are you doing? more? More blood? - Yes. Ok. - How do you agree? You want to kill me, but I will kill you first... - You're right. - What are you doing now? It will do you good. I will kill you... for what you did to me these 20 years. 20 years... and I'm like an idiot waiting for you. I find you and what do you do to me? A bleed. - The blood that has become... - How beautiful. What are you doing, ma'am? Are you bleeding him out? Maybe I've gone a bit too far. Give him an orange juice. With a lot of sugar. Viviana... Why do you treat me like this? OMG! What's wrong with you? What do you have, Mario? Forgive me, it was a joke. Why don't you answer, Mario? It is that I was left with a single liter of blood in my body. Viviana me... - Haven't you felt bad for me? - For you? You deserved a couple of slaps. What does it matter to me, I like it. leave it. The game is over. Leave. And now what do you do? You are still pale. - Leave. - If you are sweating all over. I have nothing left to do here. Leave. I want to tell you something. I thought I wouldn't be able to feel ashamed again. But yesterday, when you saw me dressed as a girl... me avergonc�. Good. I'm glad for you. You have to understand that it is past water, it no longer counts. Since you are here... It's past water, do you understand? It's all different. Are you making fun of me? - �Te vas? - S�. So, crime or accident? - Suicide. - Are you decided? You're not going to change your mind? Decided on what? Ah, why am I leaving? I haven't changed my mind in 20 years, I'm not going to change it now. Listens... Can I cash this check without problems? - Let's see. -What are you doing? - Let. -It's mine! D�jame ver. This is the check that Bonfigli gave to someone just before he died. do you know? This is what I get for doing favors for people. -Where did you get it? They come to ask you a favor, that they need money right away, that the banks are closed, which is Saturday... The interest, 20%. - Who gave it to you? - Banking secrecy. - What would trust be otherwise? - Let's see the endorsement. I need you. I think I know what it's about. Come with me. Are you going by motorcycle? �El cheque! �Es m�o! But what are you doing? Hola. Ah, t� tambi�n est�s. Go with mom, who is waiting for you. - Didn't you have to go? - Yes, but then I... ...I've seen this. - Who gave it to you? Cec�. Gracias. Some are born with a hump and others like me... you can't see it, but my hunchback has cost me everything I had. You cannot imagine what they ask you for a girl. - And the younger, the more it costs. - Two million. You were one of the cheap ones. - Because my parents were idiots. - But you don't... Then you recovered, with your good percentage over the friends. So you killed him for money. I killed him for a thousand lire. I need a million. I asked him, he didn't want to give it to me. I was 10 years old, when he gave me the first thousand lire. I had forgotten about it. On Saturday when he told me no, my memory came back to me. In fact, after killing him, I felt... relieved. My duty is over. Sergeant Badaloni will take care of you now. Be careful with that one, she's worse than me. No, worse than you impossible. I left you very elegantly, by letter. I did not go to Rome. This will come, but only for convenience, ...uses you as a second course. - I know. But this time I won't fall. - You've already fallen. - It will. But it works fine for me. - So how? - I'll tell you next time.
