The National Audiovisual Institute of Finland and the Radio Symphony Orchestra Present FINLANDIA ? THE MOVIE Finlandia (1922) was commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It would later be updated and shortened, and parts of it were used in other films. The arrangement of the material in this restoration is based on handbills, film reviews and archival documents. Film material wasn't found for all scenes. All of the takes in this version were not used in the original. The intertitles are new. A nitrate negative and duplicate materials were used as sources. The original version may have been tinted in both yellow and orange, but only orange tint has been used here. The score includes Finnish music by the likes of Sibelius and Kuula, as well as folk tunes. Most of the music has been rearranged for a symphony orchestra. I.
