There are different colours and different shapes. but they have something in common. In the world. There are different types of love and different types of hate love and hate also have something in common. They also exist between humans.

I can take care of myself. Mom, rest in peace, don't come back again. Songen. Sonqen. did you hear some strange noises coming from your backyard last night? Songen, what's the matter? Stop scaring me. You almost gave me a heart attack. I was going to ask you. I was going to ask you. did you hear some strange noises last night? I came to ask Songen about that. -I heard noises, it's scary. I also saw something moving into Songen's backyard. Could it be the ghost of Songen's mother? Nonsense. It's Impossible. Come on. let's go. You scared me. What's the matter? Mrs Zhang's grave... -What about it? I think something crawled out of her grave. Amitabha. You're scaring me. Iook. It's indeed Songen's mother - Let's go. stop looking. Detective Wang - Songen. what's up? My mom died a few days ago, but she comes out of her grave every night. How's that possible? You're having illusions. She climbs out of her coffin every night. She even sits in her favourite chair. Detective Wang, please investigate it. You should go home. Detective Wang. please help me. I can't. I'm very busy. Detective Wang please, I need your help. All right, I'll check back later. Detective Wang... Don't worry. -Detective Wang. You should go home But I... Go home. Go home Go home I'll wait for you. OK, see you later. Please go, go home. He's acting weird. Let's check on him later. Songen, what's the matter? You're not going home? He's worried his mother might come back to haunt him. Nonsense She's the best mother in the world. I'm not scared of her. I just don't understand... Songen. Have you ever heard of cold skeleton? I don't understand. Let me explain to you. I don't understand. Let me explain to you. Cold skeleton means dead people are merciless to living people. dead people are merciless to living people. What? But... A Mother and her child are very close. Husband and wife are very close. But once a person is dead, all feelings of love will be gone. That's why Humans and ghosts are different. We live in two different worlds Ghosts mean no harm to humans. Right. My mom... She comes back every night to haunt you. not because of love. You'd better be careful. Right. you have to be very careful at night. Songen, you should probably stay here tonight, don't go home. Right, It's too dangerous. No. my mom is all alone up on the hill. I want to keep her company. - let's take a rest -Ok Detective Wang. long time no see. -Yes. Good... Hi, Detective Wang. long time no see. Come on. Sit down. - Mr Li. bring me some food. Get some food for Detective Wang. Sure Sit down, please. Sit down Come on... Detective Wang, what brought you here late at night? Saying his mother comes out of her grave every night. It's impossible. Exactly. It's our job to check on him. In psychology, this phenomenon is called sleepwalking. Songen Is suffering from sleepwalking. Sleepwalking? What is it? I don't know. What does it mean? It's a psychological disorder, also known as somnambulism. What's up? I don't know How did you know? •We major in psychology. Right. in Zhang Songen's case, He digs out his mother's body and carries it home every night when he is actually dreaming. By the time he wakes up. he has forgotten what he has done during sleepwalking He thinks his mother has come back. The cause of this phenomenon is, the patient intends to use a symbolic way to solve related imagination and psychical conflict. When he is sleeping, he acts out what he has imagined during the day. He will probably dig out the body tonight. Not only will he dig out the body. when he wakes up and realises the body has come back. his fear and stress may become unbearable, and eventually turn him into a psycho. He may even hurt himself. You're Saying he will kill himself? It's possible. Hurry, let's go - Ok... Wang. hurry up! Cold skeleton... Cold skeleton. Cold skeleton. Cold skeleton. Cold skeleton. Cold skeleton. Mom I'm so sorry. Mom I'm so sorry. You won't be able to come back again. Let me stay with you. Mom. I'm coming Hurry up and put him down -Yes. Hurry up The story of love and hate has ended. Hate is buried along with Zhanq Songen and his mother. But their love withers and blooms. like the flowers on the hill. The flowers continue to grow and cover the land. Oh no. we're lost in the wilderness. Where are we going to sleep tonight? Young master, we're lost, but why are you chanting? What else can I do? If my father didn't force me to study. I would fool around with girls all day. I wouldn't have to take the imperial examination. and we wouldn't have come to this spooky place. Poor me... Young Master, stop complaining. If you didn't insist on chasing that girl we would have arrived at the motel already. Shuniai, there's nothing wrong with chasing girls. Even the great master said food and sexual desires are natural. By nature, we desire food and sex. Female ghosts like young men. Young master, stop talking about ghosts. This grave looks spooky. I'm scared Shuniai. don't be scared, I'm right here with you. Even if there are ghosts, they won't harm us. Young Master. how do you know? I read it in "The Strange Tales of Liao Zhai " Ghosts respect educated men. Ms Wang. do you mind if I spent the night here? Young master, there's a house that looks like a grave. We're not so unlucky after all, Come on, let's go There we are. Hurry up. Young master, if you think this house is haunted, why do you want to spend the night here? According to "The Strange Tales of Liao Zhai" ghosts respect educated men. But it doesn't look like a haunted house to me. Of course, it doesn't look like a haunted house at night Otherwise, it would scare educated men away. So you mean... A pale old man will come out and greet us. How do you know? It's also written in "The Strange Tales of Liao Zhai" Don't be scared, follow me. Who's this? I... What are you doing at the doorway in the middle Of the night Sir. I'm lost on my way to take the imperial examination. Is it possible to stay here tonight? Let me inform my mistress Wait here. Shuniai, there's a strange noise when the door is open, How do you know? -See? Young Master, you're right. -Also, I'm sure the owner of this house is a woman. She will say, my husband is on a business trip and he won't be back soon. if you don't mind, you're welcome to stay tonight. Young Master, this house is haunted, so carry this amulet. I've told you many times I won't use it. But your mother gave it to me when we left home. I said I won't use it. Otherwise no female ghosts can approach me. Young Master -Just throw it away. What's taking so long? My mistress let you in -Thank you. come on. I'm scared Scared of what? See? I was right. I'm sure she's beautiful. She'll ask her maids to serve me. Next... Female ghosts love young men. Have a seat. My mistress is coming. My name is Song Lihe... Nice to meet you. Madam. You too. Sit down, please Thank you. This is my daughter Peifang. Peifang. come here Mom Come and meet Mr Song. Mr Song. It's an honour to meet you, Miss Peifang It's an honour to meet you, Miss Peifang I wasn't expecting a visitor. How may I help you? Young Master Mr Song. -Young Master What? What? Madam wants to know why we're here. You'd better... Understood. Madam, I got lost on my way to take the imperial examination. Madam, it would be great if we can spend the night here. No... My husband is on a business trip He won't be back soon. We always respect educated people like you. If you don't mind you're welcome to stay tonight Thank you. Madam. Thank you. Madam. Chunhua. -Yes. Qiuyue -Yes. Go ahead and clean up the guest room. Yes... Mr Song, you must be very tired. Please take a rest. Excuse me -Sure... Young Master... What are you doing? It's an old tradition. Gentler, ok? Don't wait until it withers. Don't wait until it withers. As for heaven and earth, Earth is yin and heaven is yang. Yin and yang are opposite but complementary. Yin and yang contain each other and give rise to each other. Young Master, water is ready. you may take a bath. Nice body. How dare you harass my daughter? How dare you harass my daughter? Young Mistress please take your clothes off. Straighten you legs Lift your right leg up. Young Mistress, you have very delicate skin. That's not true. You're a beautiful Young Mistress. Gentler. Ying, the water is cold, bring more hot water.

Somebody, help... What's going on? Young Mistress is naked! Check this out! This is outrageous! Somebody, catch him! Yes... It's a misunderstanding. You want a girl? Have fun with this pig. What? You want me to play with this pig? Oh, dear. I already have a girlfriend. Play with this Old man. It's stinky here. I'm not in the mood for jokes. Listen. It's important that you know when to yield. It was your idea to stay in this haunted house. You wouldn't listen to me. What are we going to do? It was an accident. I'm just worried they might send us to jail. We're going to suffer. Nonsense. When the sun comes up. all suffering will end. Why is that? Remember? Ghosts can't do anything during the day. This house will become a grave. Once it becomes a grave I'll get revenge. I'm going to smash this grave. Young Master, you can't do that. Let's get some sleep and wait for the sun to come up. The sun has risen. Young Master, the sun has risen Really? We overslept. If didn't turn into a grave? That means they are humans not ghosts. Get up. Thank you, Madam. As an educated man, how can you be so shameless? I wish I could tell you how sorry I am. but I can't find the words You have no shame What else do you want to say? Yuanfu, tie them up and send them to jail. - Yes. Madam, forgive me... I thought this house was haunted and you were ghosts. Waif, what did you say? I thought this house was haunted and all of you... What? You thought we were ghosts so you could do anything. and sexually harass my daughters? No... No... As an educated man. you should understand. Even If we were ghosts, you should respect us. I know I was wrong. Madam, show some mercy. don't send us to jail Otherwise, I would be late for the examination. Madam, please forgive me this time. Mom, don't let this pervert go. Teach him a lesson Ok. Since you have apologised, I won't send you to jail. Thank you. Modam... But If I don't punish you. my daughters will be very upset. Yuanfu. - Yes. - Hit him fifty times. -Hit him! Madam please wait. What else do you want to say? What else do you want to say? Madam... My Young Master made a mistake and offended your daughter. Please understand that he is weak and intolerant. Madam, please show mercy. How dare you. Don't tell me what to do. I dare not. Let me ask you. As a servant. what's your responsibility? I shall take care of my Young Master. during the examination period. As his guidance. you let him go amuck. You're not doing your job. Yuanfu. -Yes. Hit him twenty times Madam, show leniency... Shut Up! Lie down! It’s only twenty times. Our mistress is very forgiving. Hit him! - No. One, two, three. One. two. three. One person does evils but two person gets punished. Go away... Young Master, to protect yourself, you'd better carry this amulet. What? I thought you threw it away. No wonder we didn't run into ghosts. If you don't throw it away. I'm going to... bite you to death. It's so irritating... Young Master. Come on, let's go. Walk faster. Young Master. you wouldn't listen to me That's why your buttocks suffered. What's the point? Stop complaining. it's all over. Young Master. Why didn't you tell me the bridge is broken? I didn't know the bridge is broken. Go away... I don't need help. It's all your fault. In the foggy forest.
