It's close, but I don't want to be a bother... I don't mind. Thank you, because getting a cab at these hours... Are you friends with S?bastien? Not at all... I was feeling uncomfortable, I don't know him. -I was with Christelle. -Who is Christelle? A brunette with very short hair... ...but she left quickly she wasn't feeling good. She didn't know anyone. But you made some friends. -Yeah, the chinese tall guy... -Yes. Wouldn't let me go. Left me his phone. An you gave him yours? I did something bad... I gave him a fake number. You're like those people? I just couldn't say no but I didn't want to see him. -Did I do wrong? -No, he seemed too young. -Who invited you? -S?bastien. We were office partners, he always invites me... ...with my wife. Was she in there? No. She had tickets for a baroque music concert. Have you been married for long? Yes... Do you have kids? Just one... a boy... And you? I've got nothing... I'm 22 years old. How old are you? if it's no indiscretion. -How old do you think? -I can't tell. You must have any idea. I won't nail it and you'll be offended. Come on, I'll take my chances. -42... 43. -Okay, I'm offended. -How old are you? 39. -I'm sorry, you do look good. -I'm offended anyway. You don't want to get old? As everyone, it's hard to see pictures of me when I was... ...younger. I can't wait to be older. Here, at the right... you can leave me in the corner. No, it's okay... -...over there? -Yes. THE FORBIDDEN WOMAN. Would you give me a fake number? No, I'll give you a real one. How would I know? You'll just have to call. Then give it to me. A pen... ...first one is from home and the other one from work. -Where do you work? -In a travel agency. And you? In real state. Well, you have a nice car. There's a coffee place open. Can I buy you a drink? No, it's late. I've got to go. Thanks a lot. -Bye. -Bye. -Hello? -Hello, Muriel? Who is this? -You don't recognize me? -No. Fran?ois, the guy with a nice car. Yes, hello. I'm glad you gave me a good number. -Were you afraid? -I was kind of restless. -Angry? -I was about to take a bath. I was calling for... maybe... we can see each other. -For what? -I don't know... to talk. -No? -Yes, if you want. -We could be less formal. -So many things... -Do you know "Le Scheffer"? -No. Shall we eat together? -When? -Tomorrow, for example. I can't tomorrow... maybe Thursday. I'll have more time. -Thursday, one p.m., okay? -Yes. I'm very happy I send you a kiss. Waitress, bell boy, construction worker, nurse... ...lots of small jobs. Then I worked in real state... ...and realized that with calculated risks one could... -...make some money. -Are you proud of yourself? -Do you think I'm full of it? -No... I admire you... ...but at the same time it seems somewhat puerile to me. -You don't like money? -Yes, but it's not my philosophy. What is your philosophy? I'm interested. My philosophy is... trivial... ...it' to be happy, doing things you love. It's vague. Of course not. Happiness isn't about making a lot of money. It can be about travelling, discovering things.... -...being in harmoy. -Does your job make you happy? Nor hapy or unhappy. I'm not devoured by ambition. I'm more interested about happiness. How do you define happiness? You intrigue me. For me... ...it's something so abstract. I don't know... -To live a great love? -Yes, maybe. -Something else? -No, I have to go. But we can see each other again. -Did I give you my number? -No, nothing. This is my work number and my cellphone. -Okay? -Aren't you missing one? Yes, but I'd rather not give it to you. -Hello? -Is Fran?ois there? -Who is this From? -Muriel. -Muriel! How are you? -Fine. I thought you weren't going to call. They asked me to try your cellphone at the office, sir. Muriel, this is wrong. I'm not happy. Angry? You still keep taking so formally to me. -I'm sorry. -Say something more casual. -I don't know... -I'll give you 10 seconds. where are you? Wagram Av., near Place des Ternes. And t?? At the office, Porte de Champerret. -It isn't very far. -No, it's close. -Are you thinking what I'm thinking? -What? -Eating... it's about time. -I'm not so hungry. I'm not really in the mood. My treat. Make an effort. -How is your wife? -After 12 years... ...we get along fine we fight very little. David keeps us together. But it's not the same as before. -Does it bother you? -No... ...I made the question. -Do you have her photo? -No. -Do you want to meet her? -Just look at her. I don't know what to tell you... ...she's very attractive, Still looking very good. She looks younger than her age. -Still love her? -Yes. Let's say the question isn't on those terms anymore. We have a functional relationship.. It would hurt if someone referred at me like that. You're 22 and believe in eternal love. -Don't you? -Yeah, eternal love... ...I could love forever... ...just not the same person. -That's horrible what you just said. -No, why? If I told you now that... ...I fell in love with you what would you say? Is this a pretend thing? Not entirely. I'd be very uncomfortable. -Why? Don't you like me? -I wouldn't want to do to one person... -...what I wouldn't want for myself. -That's so cliche. It's prudent. You're too prudent. You have a problem and apply a formula. "Not him, he's narried". -And that's wrong? -That's not the issue. It seems like an issue to me. I'll rephrase the question then. Do you dislike me? Phisically or intellectually? No. Would you make love with a guy like me? -If you weren't married, maybe. -There's no way out... Then don't make that question. You know I'd ask eventually. -It's okay that you're somewhat young... -A little girl, say it. I'd say naive, but you know men already. This can't be the first time someone ask you this. -Not a married guy. -She isn't here. She is. That changes everything. I feel like touching you. Can I touch your hand?? No. -Not even? -No. Why? It'd be a start. I just want a friendship. Do you think there's a friendship already? Too young to be your friend? No. Age has nothing to do with it. I like being with you... ...I like hearing you... ...I like to talk to you, share your problems... ...but my friendship... I don't deserve it? Friendship is between men because... ...they can't make love. I propose to you a full relatioship. -"Full"? -Yes. -And your wife? -Keep her out of this. If you have to cheat on her it won't be with me. What a pity... ...really, what a pity... ...we could've had some beautiful moment, really intense. I could make love to you for hours, you're so beautiful. We'd have to hide. you'd have to lie. No, I don't want that. -Then, what we do? -Like in the beggining... ...being friends. Or pals, if you prefer. As your pal, I ask you to let me take your hand. -It's and obsession. -It's no big deal... ...unless it's a highly erotic area for you. -Just a few seconds... -Well, okay, go ahead. Do you feel like cheating? No. And I hope you neither. His name is Pascal. We ate together and he came with me to my house. I didn't dare to ask him to come up. Neither did he. We stayed outside talking about an hour.. -He didn't try anything? -He's shy. -He should've helped him. -I don't know how. Buy a drink for him it isn't a big deal. I know, it just didn't happen. I think he's very slow. He needs some time. -Is he handsome? -No. He is for me, but he's not handsome. If he did go upstairs, would've have sex with him? I don't know. It depends in how he would've asked -If you did, what would you've thought? -I'd been glad. -I don't believe you. -I swear. I'm not trying to keep everyone from being near you. And since you made me understand I have no chances whatsoever. ...It may be someone else who enjoys it. Take your hand off... please, take it off. You have to be honest. Want it or not, being here goes against your morals... You know I'm in love and will do anything to get you. But you won't make it. -But you're letting me try... -No. For me we're only friends. You know that can change... -...it will change. -Don't be so full of yourself. It happened the day before yesterday. -Finally he decided to do it. -His car broke... ...then I went to his house. -Where were you heading? -To the field. -And? -We spent the afternoon at his place. -Comments? -Well... ...well, nothing extraordinary. His apt. is weird. -And him? -Him? -Very cute. -What does that mean? Lots of kisses, caresses. And the rest? You gossip! You wouldn't like if I told you. We're friends. -When you feel like it. -Not at all. To be honest... I was hoping for more... But the good thing is that we did it. -Are you in love with him? -Yes, I think so. -When are you seeing him? -Tonight. -And what the fuck is it in for me? - I knew you'd be jealous. If you fall in love there won't be a place for me. I'm not in love with you. -Just a little... -No. Just tell me we'll make love.. -We won't, ever. -Why so sure? I don't want to, it's that easy. I'll tell you something: I won't tell you we'll make love... ...and you won't tell me we won't do it... Whatever. I have something to ask you... Something? ...something peculiar... -I fear the worst. -I don't think you can guess. You know our limits. You set them. Okay, I'm listening. Ehmm... I want to see you naked. Sorry? I want to see you naked, no clothes. -For what? -To look at you, that's all. -You want to look at me? -Yes, just look at you. Why should I accept? To please me. And I promise I won't touch you. You're insane. It's a legitimate wish. You're beautiful. -No. -What? -I'm sorry you're crazy. No. -Why? Because it's something that goes beyond the boundaries of our relationship. Have you never done anything like it? No, when I get naked in front of a man if because I'm his. And in the beach? You belong to everyone? It's not the same in the beach, it's public. We can do it in a public place... ...you can do it in a beach. I just take the top part in the beach... Okay then. You're out of your mind! A lot of guys have seen your breasts... -...I imagine I'd be one more. -You're not anyone. I know you, I know your plan. And what do you think the people who watch you think? I don't know about that. Right now, a guy might be masturbating thinking about your breasts... That's stupid! You'd be disapppointed. -I don't think so. -Yes. No. I cheat when I dress up. I'm skinny. Don't you think you're pretty? Okay then, show yourself as you are, horrible... ... and I won't want to make love to you. I'm embarrassed. That I won't want to make love to you? No. Just you looking at me, judging me... ...I'd feel bad. -You want me to like you. -No. It's contradictory. Either you don't care about my judgement and you show yourself... ...or you're afraid because you want me to like you. -You're making everything complicated. -No, it' simple. And who tells me that if I do you won't step over the line? Don't you trust me? That really hurts me... ...I could've take advantage on many situations... ...but I didn't. I respect you. Am I right? Yes. If I give you my word would you believe me? I believe you. So, do you accept? I didn't say yes! You're increible! Let's say it happens in a normal place... -...in an unisex sauna. -I don't like those places. To bad, I'd been ideal. You'd be safe there... ...nothing would happen to you. That's not the problem I trust you. -In your place then. -No... ...my place is ugly. -In a hotel? -That's vulgar. A nice hotel... a suite... ...with old furniture and television... Would we spend the night? For example. And you won't touch me? I promise. Wouldn't you like a breakfast in a palace? Yes. Say yes and I'll take care of everything. Would I have to be fully nude? I wouldn't be happy with the beach version... ...in a palace. You won't make offensive remarks? I swear. This is the first time I agree to do something like this. -Have you been asked? -No. Say yes then. Okay... yes, okay. When? -I don't know. -Set a date. Two weekends from now. -Why so far? -Take it or leave it. I'll take it. Let's say... ...the 12th. It's a friday. Friday 12, perfect. -You won't change your mind? -No. -Can I trust your word? -Of course you can! I don't know what came over me. You gave me some drinks... I commited myself.... ...but I think I didn't think it through. -You don't want to anymore! -There's your wife... That's my business. Don't you worry about it. I am worried. And how will make this work? I don't understand... I'll get naked... ...I'll lie down in erotic postures. -I can't do that. -I wasn't thinking about that. Then make yourself clear. No, I don't feel like it. I'm disappointed, but it's okay. I had your word. -Don't take it like this. -How should I take it? With a self indulgent big fake smile? I promised you that there wouldn't be more than we said. I booked a room in a beautiful hotel. I organized my absence regarding our date. And you come here feeling bad should I be happy? What are you afraid of? losing your respectability? I won't touch you. Hurting my wife. She won't know anything. And I can tell you: Do you think I haven't had lovers before? And those girls weren't whores or women with low morals. We loved each other and it was fine. -But I don't love you. -That's isn't true. You are lying and lying to yourself. If you didn't love me we wouldn't see each other 3 times a week... ...you wouldn't look at me like you do... ...you wouldn't be so available. You think you're decent becaue you won't make love to me. I remember you saying we wouldn't make love. Why would you doubt? I won't touch you. See? I told you. -You're crazy, you look great. -Stop it. I'm skinny. My bones show up. My knees are all screwed. Can I kiss you? You said no. Can I take your hand? Can I kiss it? -Just the hand? -Just the hand. Are you angry at me? No. Do you regret it? I don't know. Give me a smile. You won. You should be happy. You're gloating. I love you. Bullshit. Yes, it's true. -I've told you already. -You said "somewhat in love" Because I didn't know you well. Now I know. Have you cheated a lot on your wife? No. I'm sure you did. -Why do you ask? -To see your liar's face. I would never lie to you. You wouldn't! You lied to me since the first time. You were thinking: "I have to fuck this one" Yes, it's true. But I didn't keep it secret for long. I didn't premeditate everything like you. Sure. You thought: "I like him" And since you have a contradictory ...sprit, you added: "I won't make love because I like him." I think I could be your friend instead of loving you. And now you're upset with it? Now it's worse. I don't feel proud. I feel bad. Embarassed. -Why? -We, hiding here... ...the lies to your wife, and me naked, your accomplice. Don't you feel good in my arms? Yes. That's the horrible thing... I feel good. Hold me, hold me tight. Hello? Muriel, I forgot my son's birthday. My inlaws are coming to dinner... -...we won't be able to see each other. -No! -Are you upset? -I'm not happy. I guess this birthday is important. Just talk about it. He asked me for a Megadrive... ...and I forgot. I have to run for it. When will be see each other? I'll call your office tomorrow. Okay. What will you do tonight? I don't know... ...Reading, or watching TV. -Hello? -Who were you talking to? Christelle. And the party? Okay. I got the Megadrive. He's happy. -Where are you calling from? -Home, I'm alone. -Do you miss me? -Yes. I miss you a lot... ...I can't stop thinking about your breasts. I love them. I haven't told you enough. They're so beautiful. What are you wearing? A t-shirt. Old, I look horrible. -I feel like kissing you. -And me. -But you don't know where. -I can tell. -Can we see each other tomorrow? -I'm finished tomorrow at... "MURIEL, I LOVE YOU... ...PLEASE FORGIVE ME." -Hello? -What are you doing? Trying to sleep. What time is it? 3:50 I turned off the light at 12, but I only slept half an hour. -Hello? -Yes... -Can you hear me? -Yes. -You know what I did? -No. I punished myself for leaving you that night. -You punished yourself? -Like in school... ...I wrote 700 times "Muriel, I love you and I ask you to forgive me" You're crazy. You can check the punishment tomorrow. 700 times? A little more, 710 o 712. -Let's make it a thousand. -Stop, my hand hurts. I don't care. If you want an A+ make it a thousand. With good letter.etra. There you go. -Is this all? -It's complete. I'll count at home. You're beautiful when you're in charge. -It's true, you're beautiful. -I didn't sleep, I was awoken. -Who? -Pascal. I didn't want to talk to him. I thought it was you. I can't tell when it's you that is calling. What did he want? He invited me for a weekend at the beach. -Did you say yes? -Neither yes or now. I was stalling. -Do you want to go? -No. But I feel like I should -What for? You don't love him. -No, but... ...I think I'd be good to be a little less excited. You'll be bored and the weather will be horrendous. What do you propose? I can't. I have things to do. -But I promise to call you. -My answering machine will be there. That's cruel, what you're saying. I don't want to be alone. Sea breeze will make me good. -Don't fuck him! -Don't fuck your wife! Is not the same... ...and I wasn't going to. Do you do it often? No. How often? Once a month? More? -Less... -Meaning? -Give me a number to call you. -Answer! What do I know! I don't know the hotel he wants to take me to. I'll leave you a message in your machine. Can you call her? No. Thanks. Thanks. -I'm going to miss you. -I hope so. Are you leaving by car? -Is he a good driver? -He doesn't drive a Porshe. Don't go. I'll see you sunday. -How long? -An hour. Too little. Two hours. Not enough. Okay, whatever. Do whatever you want. This is Muriel I'm not home. Leave a message after the tone... ...and I will call you. Muriel, It's me. Are you there? You're not? I managed to escape to meet you this afternoon. I'm sorry about everything we said last time. I love you... I need you. Since we made love, I haven't made it with my wife. I don't want you to be jealous. For me it'd be logical that you were... ...you might be in the arms of another man. I'm afraid that you fall in love with him, that you leave me. I don't know what would I do to talk you, listen to you... ...it's awful how much I need you. Lots of kisses. I will call you monday to your work. It was great. We walked at the beach for a long time. ...I thing I got a tan. I don't think so. We ate sea food. I love them! We have those in Paris. I didn't say otherwise. Which hotel did you stayed in? We were at an apartment... ...it was his mom's.... ...very nice, comfortable. Did you sleep together? He wanted to... what could I do? Say no. Well, I said yes. Going over there and saying no I'd be disgusting. Did you tell him? What? That we were together. No, there wasn't a reason. So he thinks you're free... But I am free! With someone like you you're free. Are you doing it on purpose? -What? -Hurting me like this. Not at all. You ask me, I answer. We were in Deauville, we made love and we didn't talk about you. You're not the only thing worth talking about. Did you listen to my message? This morning. Didn't you arrive last night? Yes, but I was exhausted and fall asleep with makeup on. It was a long weekend. I couldn't stop thinking about you. I thought about you too. I even have proof. -I brought you a t-shirt. -A t-shirt? -I can't wear those often. -I hope it fits. You better wear it it's my gift. -I don't like having people over. -Why? I don't know. This is small and unpractical. I like it. I did chores, It was... ...a complete mess here. -Doesn't bother me. -You should've seen my underwear... ...you would've lost your desire for me. I always want you. Specially now. Well, I have to talk to you about it. -Yes? -Would you tell me... There. I don't take the pill. You're teling this to me now? I was never on risk of getting pregnant. If you're afriad of AIDS... Did you get tested? No. No? You make love without a condom? -Was he wearing one? -Yea, he knew. What do you want me to say? That you're right? Don't get ahead of yourself. I'm getting ahead of myself. I don't want to take risks. Let's do the test and if we're both negative we'll go to the doctor. ...so he can prescribe me the pills. Okay? -Okay. -Can we set a date? -No rush... -Then I won't make anything with you. -What do you propose meanwhile? -Condom or nothing. Okay, let's do the test. When? Tomorrow. I know a good lab. Do you trust? Yes. Now come here. I'm telling you, I'm not getting naked if... -Fran?ois... -I want you. Me too, but what if I get pregnant? -You won't. -How can you say that? Come on, come over... No, stop. -Come. -Take off your hand. -Take off your hand. -I'll go mad if you say no. I'm not in the mood. That's it, I'm not in the mood. I'm not asking you to be in the mood. I'm asking you to do it. Do you realize what you're asking for? I'm telling you I don't want to And I don't want to. Okay? It's me. What do you want? -Where are you? -Near Porte d'Orl?ans. But you just left... I have a fast car. If I ask you to forgive me, will you? -Not enough. -I'm sorry. Come back. -What for? -To make love. Without condom? No condom. If we get AIDS we'll die together. -That's stupid. -Come. -There's a straight line. -Run it over. -Are you dressed the same way? -Yes. Take off your sweater... Okay. -Okay? -Idiot! It's done... -...should I take the rest? -Yes. Okay. I'm naked. How's your hair? In a bun? Yes. Let it loose. Now what do I do? Nothing. Don't move. Wait. -The results? -In two days. -Can you get them? -No, I have an appointment. -But I can send someone. -Who? Juliette, someone I work with. -Your secretary? -Yes... something like that. -Are you fucking her? -No. We work together, and I'm very fond of her. How old is she? 27. Married? No, she lives alone. Does she answer the phone? -What does she says about me? -What do you want her to say? She makes no comments. She isn't in love with you? No... I don't think so. You want to send her to pick the analysis? -She does earrings. -That's not just any earring. I did the test to give you peace of mind. The result doesn't worry me. I don't want your Juliette to know it before. I will send someone else. No, okay. I'll go. If you want to. I don't want you to tell her about our relationship. If you knew what I told her, you'd be excited. But I don't tell her any details. -That's your alibi for your wife? -Yes. That night at the hote, did she know? And watched you come all fresh looking? I wasn't looking very fresh. I can't do that. -Are you upset? -No, I've gotten used to it. I love you, tell her everything but don't cheat on me with her. Should I send someone for the results? No, I already told you I would go. Why wouldn't explain it to me over the phone? I went for results. Mine is negative... -And mine? -They need to research further. Research what? They want to be sure. They're checking. Am I positive? We'll get the answer in a week. -Who told you that? -The girl at the lab. -Didn't you see Meunier? -No, who is he? -The owner, a friend. -I just saw the girl. I don't understand. If there was something wrong, I'd have gotten a call. They didn't talk about problems. They didn't know. -Are you okay? -Yes, okay... VIH 1 , VIH 2... ...both negative. But for you... a week is a lot. Forever. The girl before me, who was she? That was two years ago. What kind of girl? Okay, my dentist's assistant... -Did you love her? -No, it was just physical. We did it without a condom, but I barely have a past. Was she on drugs? She was on drugs? I don't think so. And before? Before... ...there was a blonde, but we did it just once. That's enough. Although... ...she was kind of "loose"... ...she smoked hashish, and maybe something else. -And before? -How far back are we going? Don't take it the wrong way. I'm asking it for you. I haven't been with that many woman, not as many as you think. Are you scared? Is not that... I'm upset. It's good that you're okay, but me... You never had symptoms? I don't know, sometimes I've had heartburn... ...but nothing serious. -And if I told you...? -What? I got both results! You're negative! You're insane! Completely insane! I'm jealous! I wanted to know about the others! I could've told you you were positive! Hello, this is Muriel. I'm not home, but leave your messsage. . Attention. Talk now. Muriel, it's me. I'm sorry about the slapping. I didn't mean to strike you, I just did. I don't know what happened. I've never hit someone. But you have to confess you were diabolically cruel. Call me soon. We have to forgive each other. I didn't sleep home. I stayed the night at Pascal's. -I figured that much. -I told him everything. I told him you hit me. You even loosened a tooth. I'm gonna have to see a dentist. He said you were violent and that I should leave you. He even told me to sue you. He knows a doctor and a lawyer that will make that work. -So many people! -He doesn't like violence. I am not violent. I've never gotten in a fight. There's no danger with me... ...you're 20 kilos heavier than me. Did you fuck him? That's all you're interested in? You don't have to answer. Yeah, I did sleep with him. And I insisted. He didn't want to? Asshole. I brought you this so you could forgive me. What is this? Open it. Is this gold? You can change it if you want to. What will it be next time? A collar? -Stop, I haven't slept. -Very nice. Put it on me. -Can I kiss you? -No. -Are you seeing him again? -Of course. He's very nice. He even brought cookies. And walked me to work. He asked me to go back outside for the weekend. I want you. I can't, I made love all night. Wil you call me when you're feeling better? I might. Rest. Can't I get a kiss? -What did you order? -Soup and some fish. -Some choice. -Is that wrong? Yes, but the service here is very slow. -They'll take an hour and a half. -Are you in a rush? Yes, I want you. Me too. And hour and a half plus an hour to go to your place... ...I don't think I'll make it. Do you want to leave now? No, I'm hungry. What do you propose? The first floor bathrooms... ...how about it? You want to do it in the bathroom? It isn't very romantic, but I can't handle it anymore.. If we go together, people will get suspicious. We can't do it right here... Okay... ...men or women? Women! Let's do this: You go first... ...1st. door to the left... ...I'll wait a minute and I'll catch up, okay? Okay. What are you wearing underneath? -My blue underwear. -Do I know them? I don't know, but I won't show them here. -Are you wearing pantyhoses? -I'm sorry, no. I'd like for you to take your skirt, your stockings, your underwear... -...just shoes. -Naked? -Yes, with shoes -Okay. Go, now... I'll count to 60 and catch up with you. -And if we get served? -We won't take long. When will we sleep together? We already have. Once. Do you need to? I'm cold when I'm alone. Specially on my feet. Can I get a massage? I can try. A friend was good at it, he took hours. It drove me crazy. Who was he? His name was Fr?d?ric. I never talked to you about him. Were you with him for long? A year... I left him. And you're sorry... you're sad. But he was cheating on me. He was fucking another woman. I found a small package in him that said... ..."I love you". Two days before Valentine's day. I thought it was for me. And at Valent?ne's day... -There wasn't a gift. -No... ...and he left me alone... came back at 10 o clock... He started lying, saying his dad had ask him... ...to help him move... ...I asked him if she liked the present... ...I left him breathless... and I started crying. -How did he defend himself? -He confessed everything and told me... ...that he still loved me. -And you didn't believe him? -How could I? Don't you think it's possible to love two woman at the same time? No? Women imagine that when you love one you can't... ...love another one. It's either one or the other. There are men with enough heart for several women... -Are you talking about yourself? -No, about your friend. Married? NO, I was 19, he was 23. But if he didn't love you, why stay with him? I don't know. I think he loved you. -But he could also love another one. -Maybe, but I dont' share. With me you have to. Yes, but it won't last forever. You're my first and last married man. It's painful. If I should vanish from your life, It'll be me who leaves... ...and I hope it hurts that it hurts like hell. Why are you so mean with me? I'm upset because you made me fall in love with you. Wasn't it worth it for the good times? Times... always watching the clock... "I'm late"... ..."Someone's waiting"... ..."They need me", without saying it's her... It's just to protect you. Do you think I forget you're married? When we make love a part of me thinks about her. What I'm stealing for her I will have to take it back. I'm sorry if I hurt you, I'm sorry. "I'm sorry"... ...that's the only thing you know how to say... -What's up with you today? -I want you to stay the night. I can't. I beg you, I don't want to be alone. -I want to be in your arms? -And that whim? I beg you, stay. I'm cold. -Turn the heat up. -Thanks, I didn't think of that. I'm going to Deauville with Pascal this weekend. -What does that has to do with...? -Nothing, I'm just saying... ...and I'll fuck him as long as I want. If you want to... -Are you leaving? -I have to leave. I hope I've emptied your balls so you can't fuck... ...your wife! Hello, this is Muriel. I'm not here but please leave a message. ...and I will call you back. Talk now. Muriel, it's me. It's 10 o' clock, you can call me until 10:30... ...or tomorrow at the office. Lots of kisses. Hello, this is Muriel. I'm not here but please leave a message... ...and I will call you back. Talk now. What's wrong, Muriel? In your work they're saying you're not there and I get the... ...machine in your house. I'm waiting for an explanation. Anytime! Hello, this is Muriel. I'm not here but please leave a message.... ...and I will call you back. Talk now. Muriel... this is unbearable. What are you doing? I know you're there and you don't want to answer. Muriel, I love you. I need to see you and soon. I bet that... Pascal guy is there, conforting you. I don't care! What do you want me to do? Pick up, damn it! It's been 4 days, I'm sick. I don't eat. I don't work. Do you want to break up? It's okay! Just say it! Fuck! -What's up? What's wrong? -You weren't answering. I had to come. Do you see what time is it? 4 am. I need to sleep. -Are you alone? -Yes. -Let me in, I want to talk. -I'm tired. If you don't let me in, I will make a racket and wake up the... ...neighbours. I will do it. From anything... -...be reasonable, for your own sake. -15 minutes tops. I'm listening. I understand how you feel. I understand that you need a man for yourself... ...a man who stays. Unfortunately, I have a life, a wife and a kid... ...and it's impossible for me to throw it all away. Then... ...I say, let's start on new rules... ...something new, something concrete. Go on. Leave your apt. and we rent a bigger, more comfortable one. Will you leave your wife? No... Let's say I make arrangements to stay two nights with you. Will you tell her? No, I'll make trips from France to Italy... I have a project in Rome. Everything should be fine. And the apt. Who's paying? Don't worry about it. -I knew you would buy me! -Do you want to share a rent? -I can't afford it. -Then I'll take care of it... You've said that here it isn't that well... Imagine, 50 meters... ...in district 15... ...with a view to the Senne or a terrace... -Very nice... -You're unbelieveable! You don't want to? If I say yes I'll be at your mercy. You could come whenever you want. And when I'm fed up I'd have to look for another place. You'll ask me to leave my work... I don't want you to stop working... And the Italy thing, how long is that going to be? 2, 3 months? -More. -Even 6 won't be enough. Bad idea. You made a vain effort. -What do you want me to do? -Right now? To leave... ...I've decided this is enough. And if I haven't decided it? What will you do? Break everything? -Hello? -It's me. Didn't you have to sleep? -Where are you? -Very close to your place. Regarding your proposal, my answer is still no. -Has nothing changed? -Yes, we won't break up still. My love... ...do you want me to turn around? No, I want to be alone. Say that you love me. Good night. -Hello? -Muriel? Am I bothering you? I can't talk, there's a client here. Upset? No, why? Let's go the fields tomorrow. We should catch good weather. -I can't take a day off like that... -Say yes... -It isn't possible. -Say yes. -My client is getting impacient. -Say yes. Yes. Easy! I'll talk to you later to set up the details. -Do you come here with your wife? -Sometimes, if the weather's good. You must get so bored! We come here to rest... ...we invite some friends and make barbecues. It's not a big deal, but it's nice. Why did you bring me here? To see you in a familiar place. Isn't that a little perverted? No. I like the house and I wanted to show it to you. That's it. Do you want to make love in your conyugal bed? I'm not that crazy. Too bad, I feel like it. I would even say it turns me on. I'm surprised. -And the bedroom? -Why? I want to see it. This is it. I'm not silly. This is the guest room. I think this is it... it's bigger... -Did your wife dressed it? -Yes. She has good taste. Are you coming? No, not here. -Don't you want me? -Yes, but not in this room. You cheat on her but not in her bed! Regarding Ir?ne... ...there are thing I wouldn't do to her. Who cares? She won't know. I will know, get out... Be coherent. You bring me to your house, I can smell your wife... ...all around. This isn't innocent. You want to fuck me, but not in the conjugal bed... ...but in the guest room. Well, sorry! If you want to fuck me, It'll be in this bed. And I think you want to. The hidden lies, the cheating, you love it. We'll go all the way. Let's dirty up the sheets so you can get turned on... ...but not a lot, so she doesn't realize. What does your wife do? She has a store. She works part time. What does she sell? Sweaters. I thought that with your salary she didn't work. Where is her store? What do you care. Isn't it legal? I don't advertise her. At least tell me the name. ?No! I should've never told you about it. -Why so much mistery? -Because! -Keeping things separate? -Yes!, separate! You didn't give the name to your lovers? I didn't tell them and they didn't fuck with me. I want to know the name of the store even if it fucks with you. Muriel, let's talk about something else. -No! Tell me what I want to know. -And if I don't? You won't touch me tonight. Some things concern you and some things don't. This doesn't concern you. -You're selfish. -That has nothing to do with it. I'll be discreet, secretive, but not selfish. What use would the name have to you? If you want a sweater... ...I'll buy you the best ones. Don't try to buy me. You did it after the slapping. Not twice! And not with sweaters! -Magali. -Magali who? That's the name of my wife's store. And that name? We chose that name in case we had a daughter. It's nice, I like it. -Do you want the adress? -No, I won't go. Can't you tell anything? Your hair? I went to the salon... ...and while there, I went shopping. I bought sweaters. Do you like this one? Yea, it's fine. Do you recognize it? No, but I can guess. You'd think it's insane curiosity, but I wanted sweaters. -I had nothing to wear. -And since there's only one stor... Are you upset? No, I won't indulge you. You'll be eager to make comments. She's quite alright... ...I imagined her fat, brunette, sure about herself... ...I was very wrong. She's very charming. I asked her for advice, she was adorable. -Did she pick this for you? -Yes, it's nice, isn't it? I bought two of them. I was happy. I guess that turned you on. Of course, to know the woman you're sharing a man with. Weren't you looking at her too much? Yes, maybe. But I didn't feel her as a rival anymore. And I wanted her to watch me. So I payed with a check. I showed her my ID. She saw my picture. I thought about the house in the fields. In the intimate details I know by memory... ...your hands, your smell... She could see my breasts. And I remembered what you say about them. We don't have the same fantasies. You made me like this. Before I didn't feel pleasure in those situations. If I'm on it, it's your fault. I hope you don't come back. If she sees me more, she'll notice I exist. You exist? Yes, that I'm real. With you everything is hidden, I wonder if it's true... ...I need it to really exist.. But it exists! I don't hide you, we go out, I show you around. People watch us! Should I talk louder? Stop. Everyone's watching. Isn't that what you wanted? You say nothing. I hear you. I have nothing to say. -Then I'll hang up... -No, not yet. What do you want? Nothing. Just don't hang up. I won't... Is this okay? We don't have to talk. No, we don't have to. -Are you afraid of silence? -No. Are you tired? No. I can hear you breathing. How is it? Funny. You breath... Can you hear? No. But I'm breathing... I can't hear it... Now? No, you're blowing... I swear to yo I'm breathing. You're blowing. Do I look stupid to you? -Yes. -Sometimes I can be really stupid. I see... Just takes a little effort... Not so much. Come see me. At this hour? -None of us is tired. -You'll be exhausted in half an hour. If you could see me you'd make love to me right away. -That's why I'd rather stay. -Motherfucker! Slut! That suits me. -I love you. -What? Say it again. No, once a day. I miss you. We have to sleep. What's wrong with you? What I'm going to say won't be nice. We won't see each other for a while... Did you meet someone? No, Irene found my credit card status... ...she saw the hotel expenses. I told her I was in Nize. She could tell. Yes... ...but I made nothing of it... ...I told her it was only once... ...that she shouldn't worry Well... ...but now... -...she doesn't trust. -Did she make a scene? No, that isn't her style. She keeps calm even when she's very upset. She was. She cried. She tried to hide, but... And your heart broke. It's been so long since I saw her crying. Since we were together, I didn't saw her much. -Because of you I neglected her. -It's my fault? Am I guilty? No, I'm guilty. But I don't want to hurt her. Do you understand? I decided to take care of her. We'll make a trip. Where? Mexico. She always dreamt about Mexico. We haven't go there. And your son? He won't go. He'll stay with his cousins. Is this like your honey moon? I haven't been out with her for a long time. It will be good for us. And what it will do to me? I don't know... How long are you leaving? 2 Weeks. I will try to call you. -Is this cruel? -It isn't cruel, it's horrible! Muriel, you have to understand. Before I met you, I had a life. And I forgot about it. I realized how much she needed me... ...my wife. It isn't easy to be between the two of you. You told me your marriage... -...was dead. -No, I never said that. You said it was function only, I'm not making this up. You said it. Yes. It just took her to find out about something for you to realize..... ...that you're in love. What did you tell her? I didn't talk about you. I told her it was a married woman. Why married? To make her old. Make her believe... ...I wouldn't see her again. I told her she loved his husband... ...that it was a one night thing only. And she believed you? Yes... ...I hope so. You won't want to break up with me? No... but if you want to.... -I won't say no. -Don't turn things around. Muriel, I don't want to leave you. I love you, but please understand that now... ...I need to get back with Ir?ne. Understand, it was a big blow for her. I understand, I'm sorry. We'll take a flight next week. We'll see each other as soon as I return. You can't before? No, we'll go to Aix. But then there's 3 weeks! I can't give her less. -Hello? -It's me. Are you in Aix? I'm calling from a phone booth. I don't have much time. -Are you alone? -Yes, Who were you thinking about? Nobody... yes, Pascal. Good idea, I'll call him. Is your wife happy? -I miss you. -Let me remember you that you left. I'll be in Paris in Friday. Shall we see each other? No, I'm working. Saturday? That's not possible. -We're taking a plane at 9. -Friday night? No, I can only do it by day. I'm not at your disposal! How nice! There's a good movie on the TV I don't want to miss the end. Okay. I'll call you back on friday. Suit yourself. Many kisses. -Hello? -I have the afternoon off. Sorry, I can't. You wanted to see me today. I can't anymore. I have appointments which I can't cancel. -Are you leaving tomorrow? -Yes. -And tonight? -I told you, it's impossible. -You wantd us to meet! -You told me you couldn't today. So I made plans. I have dinner plans... ...and a long meeting and I'm leaving tomorrow. Okay. I guess I'll just wish you a good flight. I'll try to call tonight.. Be safe. Okay. Hello, this is Muriel. I'm not here but please leave your message... ...And I'll get back to you soon. Talk now. Muriel, it's me. I don't know what hour is it in Paris you should be home... ...too bad you are not. I'm in Acapulco, it's 3 o'clock. I'll bring you here someday, it's lovely. I hope you're missing me. I'll call again. Lots of kisses. -You're black. -And you haven't seen my shoulders. -You gained weight didn't you? -We couldn't stop eating. I'll have to go on a diet. No, I like it. And you, how are you doing? I stayed here. Everything was fine. Did you miss me? I wasn't alone... I had company -Pascal? -No. I met someone... ...his name is Romain. He's very handsome. When did you meet him? Two weeks ago. I went to the movies with Christelle and then for drinks... ....and there were three guys... -Young? -25, 30 years old. There was a gorgeous one, an angel. We went to the disco, we danced. We've seen each other daily. Did you fucked him the first night? The second one. -That was fast. -I felt like it right away. He's a musician. He plays guitar like a pro... ...he works with big names, V?ronique Sanson... -...he introduced me to Alain Chamfort. -Is he looking for choir girls? Wait, I'm talking you. Where do I fit in all that? Look, Fran?ois, this isn't easy. You said I could leave you and you wouldn't say no. -The moment has come. -For you. Is that easy? This wouldn't have happened if I had you all for myself we knew well enough that this couldn't last. -I brought you this from M?xico. -What is it? -Are you insane! How much did you pay? -Hey, I didn't left the tag there. This is too much. I can't accept it. I bought it for you. Why don't you give it to Juliette? I bought her something already. -Then should I keep it? -Yes. Okay. I'll put it in this finger. It's magnificent. I'll be careful. -Why are you so lovely? -I'm awful. That's not true and you know it. -Is he a good lay? -That's enough. What will become of me? Are you serious? You're married. You have a kid, a job, don't complain. You'll be the same. Nothing will be the same. That's your problem. Give me time. Let me get used to it. This should be quick. Then... ...right now? I'm leaving... Isn't this what you want? What should we say? Goodbye? So long? We say nothing. Hello, this is Muriel. I'm not here but please leave your message... ...And I'll get back to you soon. -I was expecting everything except you. -I wanted to eat at at terrace. And how did I reappeared in your thoughts? You didn't. I thought about you every day. At least once a day. And you? The same. Once a day. You lost the weight from Mexico. Yes, and fast. You helped me with that, involuntarily. And your wife? Good. And you? Your musician? He's on tour for 15 days. Germany, Switzerland, Belgium. We're doing fine. You're still so pretty. And the ring? Only because we're meeting? I wear it often. But I'm afraid that someone would steal it. I love it. Can I lay my hand upon yours? The last time you did that it ended badly, didn't it? -I want you. -Stop. -He's fucking you well? -Romain? Yes, very well. Better than me? Can I have some wine? I'll go to the pool with Christelle. I would come along, but I have things to do. -If you want me to, I'll come with. -Thanks, that's nice. Yes, I know... too much... -Won't we ever make love again? -I didn't call you for that. I won't say today, but... -...give me some hope. -No!, becaus of Romain! I don't have to tell him, but I'm not like you. I can't lie. -Besides, I love Romain. -Who is this Romain? How long will it last? A month, two? One day he'll fuck a dancer, you'll fight and he'll be out of your life... ...as well as he got in. -Like if you were God! -Do you think you're nice? He's not the man for you.. You can say you love him but he doesn't deserve you. -Did you come to see me suffer? -Yes, I better go. -But the order has been taken! -Eat my order! Again with the same thing... You know I love you... -...more than before. -That doesn't help. When is your musician back? In a week. I'll get you pregnant before he comes back. A little bastard? You'll tell him it's yours and he will carry his last name.. -But you don't look the same. -No, he's handsome. -So are you. -Let's make a kid. -He'll have all the money... -You drunk. I mean it. -Leave me, I have to go tinkle. -No. Leave me, I have to go. I want you. I'll keep you for myself. -Let me go or I'll piss on you. -If you want to. -I'm telling you. -These are your sheets. -I don't care, I'll change them. Let me go! -No. -Fuck you! -No! That's disgusting! -You're insane! -They were just droplets. You're crazy. I don't like the escatological at all. Come to the shower. Hello? What are you doing? I've been waiting for 40 minutes. I won't go. -Why? What's wrong? -I can't. -Explain it to me. -I can't. -Are you ill? -No. -Is he back, is that it? -Yes. -Is he there? -Yes. -You can't talk? -No. I'll call you tomorrow. Lots of kisses. He was right at my side, 10 cms from me. I hung up and he asked who was it... ...like if nothing had happened. Then I got confused... I stuttered... It was very nice. I felt like he forgave me before I confessed. So I told him. You told him what exactly? That we met, that we made love, everything! With dates and times. He didn't say a thing. He locked himself up. He wasn't upset or sad... I don't know what he thinks. -Do you regret it? -No, but I don't want to lie. I will tell him I saw you today. i wanna be clear. -Why would you want to see me?? -To tell you this is over. I won't call you and I ask you not to call me. You don't love me anymore? It's over. You didn't answer me. You don't love me anymore? No... ...I don't. -I just have one hour. -Me too. -Shall we eat or shall we go to the hotel? -Do you want me? -Yes. -Then let's go to the hotel. Your friend went to see Ir?ne. Fuck! Good for you... ...You even gave her the name of the store. All the information. It was pretty agressive. First she thought about hitting me... ...But she went to see her anyway. She was with her about an hour. She told her everything and it seemed that she knew a lot. You didn't keep a detail from her. I don't blame you. You can't lie. You can't lie, but you have to know when to talk. You had to relieve your conscience. I bet you couldn't sleep. Confession should be something quick. Anyway.. ...she spilled everything. -Ir?ne didn't react in from of you. -In front of you? I took all the nice things from a broken hearted wife: Liar... ...cheater, satire... ...everything with disdain and monotony. She didn't cry this time.. -She might make a desicion. -Is she leaving you? No, she didn't talk about that. -But I think she's thinking about it. -And you? I don't see me as a divorced man. I just can't imagine it. But if she insists, I won't have a choice. But I think about David, and her too. Too many reorganizations, moving around. I don't know if I have the energy. I've never seen you so destroyed. I'll be 40 in three days. Can I buy? I can't. I'm going out with Romain. He's taking me to his tour. It's normal. He doesn't trust me anymore. With this we'll find a good reason to finish this. Yes, maybe you're right. Hello, this is Muriel, but I'm not home. Leave your message. If it's urgent , call 45 43 93 92. 45 43 93 92. Leave your message now. Hello, this is 45 43 93 92. You're calling Romain and Muriel. We're not here. Leave your message. Thanks. Bye. Muriel, my love. Five months without seeing each other. Five months waiting for you to call. I though anger broke us up. But it seems that everything's over for you. I wish you come to the phone every time it rings. I called you several times, but I didn't leave a message. I just wanted to hear your voice. But the grace of being loved by he woman you love doesn't last. Passion doesn't hibernate... ...it is either diluted or killed. Before I met you, i didn't know if I liked women... ...too much or if I hated them. Today I know. There is that magic that you can't reach that you think you have when you possess them. ...the venomous arrogance that desguises... ...the mistery of a body that reappears when it gets dressed. Deep down, I wanted to be fed up with you. ...to extinguish the desire. I had so much to give you already. I don't know how your life is now. I hope that you think about me. I'm sad to think about everything we lived together... ...and now it's all a memory... ...that someday you'll tell what united us... ...and now that feeling is just nostalghia. That is little when you meet pain. But we shouldn't blame ecah other. Memory is incapable of bringing emotion back to life. Everything worked out with Ir?ne, without working out. We try to live like we did before. We didn't want to divorce, and David helped with that. I won't finish this letter asking you to answer me. Don't do anything. Keep giving me this silence, if that's your desicion. I will write you in some weeks or months. I hope you're happy. Fran?ois.
