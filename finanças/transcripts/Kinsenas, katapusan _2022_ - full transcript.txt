Teacher Maita, they're calling all teachers to the Faculty room now. Alright, I'll be right there. Thank you! Class, here's your problem set, okay? I just have to attend a meeting at the Faculty room. When you're done answering, just place your notebook on my table. Alright? - Yes, Ma'am! - Okay, good. Let's see you try, then? Ask Ana out on a date! Hey, would you leave me alone? Dates are the farthest thing on my mind! How about you finish your studies first, Ronnie? That way, you don't look like a scrub! So what now? Not even a first date and you already got dumped! Learn how to solve a Math problem before you act like Mr. Loverboy! So, how about it? Go out with me! Stop playing hard to get! No one's ever turned me down. Oh, yeah? Then I guess I'll be the first. Leave me alone, Ronnie! I'm busy! He's got no game! Don't make me look a fool in front of my buddies, Ana! What are you on? If you don't want to get rejected, then stop asking! You're such a snob! But that's what I like about you? hard-to-get! Whoa! Cut it out! Hey! Hey! Ouch! Maybe if you stuck your noses in a book, you wouldn't be such idiots! - Girls in this school are scary! - You said it! - They can't even take jokes! - Can't mess around with them! Is there a problem? No, ma'am. We're just having a bit of fun. You're lucky you're a girl. Whatever, take your seat. Quiet! You shouldn't let Ronnie or anyone treat you rudely like that. Ronnie's been bugging me since last year. I just gave him a pass today. He'd better not push his luck or he'll have my Papa to answer to! How old is your dad? Ah, my dad? He's not that old. Besides, he doesn't like talking about his age. Actually, his birthday's next week. Aren't you that new girl? You're pretty gutsy for a new girl! But why are you such a loner? You've been around for a couple of months but you still keep to yourself. That's just how I am. I'm very shy. I only just moved here, after all. I want to invite you to my dad's birthday! Since we're friends now, aren't we? Oh, I don't know about that! But sure, if you insist. From now on, we're bestfriends! Sure, bestfriend! I finally have a bestfriend in school! Are your parents living here, too? No, they're not. Both of them are abroad. They even told me that after this school year, they're taking me there to study. That sounds great! You have the opportunity to study abroad. Do you have other siblings? I'm an only child. What about you? Blessed to be an only child! Hey, will you go with me somewhere for my dad's birthday? I need to get him something. Ana. How's school? I heard you came home late. I'm doing okay, Pa. I just dropped by somewhere on my way home. I was with my friend Beth. Who's Beth? This is the first time I'm hearing about a classmate named Beth. That's because she just transferred a month ago. We only became close today. Sir? Ma'am? I wonder if I may be excused for a couple of hours. I'm needed at home. I'll be back shortly. What's the matter, Nanny Tasing? What happened? Ah, it's nothing, Sir. It's just that my nephew's coming home. Oh, right! Sorry, Nanny Tasing, I keep forgetting about that. You should go. You don't want to be on the road after dark. Okay, Ma'am. Thank you. I'll go ahead. - Nanny Tasing. - Sir? Just go home, but don't go on ahead. You're always pulling my leg, Sir! I'm going home now, Sir. - Okay, Nanny Tasing. - We'll see you. Take care, Nanny Tasing. Be safe. That's how they speak in Batangas. Ah, Ma? Can I invite Beth to Papa's birthday party? Of course you can! We'd love to meet all your friends. These days, we have to make sure you don't associate with the wrong sort. Okay, Mama. But Beth is nice, Mama. By the way, Love. Do you have anyone else in mind for the guest list? The guest list? I think we've invited enough guests, don't you think? We don't want more people finding out how old I'm getting? Why do you have to feel bad about your age, Papa? A few more years and you'll be growing white hair! Don't be too harsh on your Daddy, sweetie. That's okay. Daddy's still very handsome! - That's what I like to hear. - Isn't he? Mama's trying to get on your good side. Your mother knows things? Love! Would you like to have the food catered? And maybe we can just email the invitations so we can save on costs. I'm sending out the emails right now. About the catering service, I'll let you handle that. You're better at that sort of thing. But don't forget to order my favorite. Adobo! Of course! How could I forget? It's your birthday, and that's your only request? You know I can live on nothing but Adobo and you. Hmph! Flatterer! I swear, if I ever catch you with another woman? Hey, why'd you turn quiet? Well, you're here now. You know I put all of my work down once you're there. Really? Of course! So? Is it hard for me yet? Is it rearing to go? It won't mind going all night long with you! Talk dirty to me. I want to hear you whisper in my ear and your breathing. This is love! This is what true love looks like! That exam gave me a headache! I know right. It made me dizzy. I just remembered, it's Papa's birthday next week! Don't miss it, okay? Is it really okay for me to go? You're going to bring me to the party? Of course! You'll be my guest! Alright, just don't leave my side. Promise I won't! I got you. I'm excited! Let's go back to the classroom. - Okay, guys! Good job! - Yes! Miguel, you're in charge of the pitch with Mr. Cruz. You can handle it! Yes, sir! I'll be with Ms. Charms and Danny, so it's a done-deal! - It'll be a piece of cake! - Okay, good! Sita. Sita! - Yes, sir? - The flight for my wife's birthday, is everything in order? Yes, Sir. The Admin has already been informed as well. - Very good. - Sita, please follow up on the Releasing. I already filed the requisition the other day. - Okay. - Okay. Thank you, guys! Job well done! Thank you! Adjourned! Adjourned! Thank you! Thank you! - Adjourned! - Adjourned! Ah, sir? May I have a minute? There's something I wanted to tell you. Okay. - Ah, excuse me, sir. - Karen. Ah, Sir, nevermind. Maybe another day. Okay. Karen, come with me. Excuse me. Sir, have you read the message I sent you last night? No, I haven't. What is it about? Please check it, Sir. Son of a bitch. Didn't I tell you not to text or message me while I'm at home? Are you out of your mind? Sorry, sir. You sent me a nude picture? Are you kidding me? You idiot. Get out of my face! Unbelievable. For your fantastic presentation! - Cheers! - Cheers! - For the road, yeah? - Yes. Wait, wait. Going back to the subject of your wife. What's going on with her? It's nothing? I don't know. What's up with you ladies? You keep getting jealous over nothing! I don't understand what goes on in her head. She tells me I'm not faithful to her. If she doesn't give it a rest, I just might give her something to be jealous about for real. Well, Sir? Maybe madame really just loves you. I can understand where she's coming from. You really do have such a strong sex appeal, Sir. Seriously? What sex appeal? It's true! You don't believe me? It's true, Sir. My husband doesn't turn me on as much as you do. Why do you look so nervous? Do you want me now? Huh? Love. I'm sorry, I think I'm going to be home late tonight. I'm still working on my presentation for the board. And I need to double check what Miguel prepared. I want everything to be perfect for this big client. No worries, Love. Just text me when you're on your way home. But don't take too long. Okay, Love. I'll text you, alright? Take care. I love you. Nanny Tasing? Ma'am? Ma'am, what's wrong? The car I booked just arrived. Could you watch over Ana while I'm out? - Yes, Ma'am. - I'm going to Conrado's office. I'm feeling nervous, I don't know why. Oh, no, Ma'am. Please be careful. Okay, okay, I'll leave you in charge. Okay, Ma'am. Don't worry. What the hell! What are you still doing in here? We need to talk. Just this once. Karen? Whatever happened between us, think nothing of it. You have a family, so do I? You should go home to them. Your family's waiting for you. Which of the things we did would you like me to forget? Everything that happened to us? You want me to forget all of it? Just like that? I've been in love with you for a long time, Conrado. I don't love my husband anymore. Karen, my problem is, I love my wife. So if I were you, I'd head on home. Conrado. - Love! - Hey, Love! What are you doing here? I was just leaving. We almost missed each other. I was worried about you so I thought I'd help you with work. You're so thoughtful. You caught me just in time. Wait, where's Ana? Who's looking after her? Nanny Tasing is back home. She got back early. Okay. I'll just go grab my stuff and we can head home, okay? Wait there. I'll be right back. Has the Madame arrived at the office? Happy Birthday! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Cheers! Thank you very much. Thank you, Darling. He'll melt if you stare him down a second longer. Something's different about you. But let me just remind you, snakes will be dealt with in our company. What are you talking about? You know what, you're going to end up an old maid because you're evil-minded! - Come, sweetie, let's go over there. - Okay, Ma. - Is your guest coming yet? - Yes, she is. She says she's nearby. Hi, Ana. Yes, hello Miss Sita. You've grown so big. You're a lady now. Not at all! I'm still a child. Papa will get angry if he hears you say that. You're telling me! Your father's got a selfish streak. What does it mean? It means he can be so protective of you. Ah, okay, Ma. - Ma'am? - Yes? Ma'am, I really love the food! On our company's anniversary, I hope we'll serve the same menu. Oh, no problem! Sure thing! I'll give you their contact number, alright? If you want more food, go ahead and eat some more. I have an idea. I'll save your number, then I'll text you when we need to contact the catering service. Is that okay? Alright, sure. No problem. Okay, Ma'am. What's your number? Okay, it's 0117-- Ah, Ma! I think Beth's here. I'll go bring her here. Okay, go ahead. - Excuse me, Miss Sita. - Okay. Thank you. 0117-822-8715. Sir! Happy Birthday! Thank you, Miguel! The food's a winner, Sir! It's really good! It's really filling me up! This is my third helping. Don't worry, just keep going back for more. Miguel, I heard from your clients and they have positive feedback! - Congratulations! Good job! - Thank you, sir. Of course, I learned from the best! You're my mentor! - Isn't that right? - Thank you. Thank you. So I'm very grateful. Thanks again. Welcome. Welcome! By the way, Sir. Sir Mike's coming. Okay, good. - Okay, okay, I'll go ahead. - Okay, just eat. Happy birthday! Thank you. Thank you! - Happy Birth-- - Please don't do that. Why? My family's right over there. So? You can't do this. I can't afford to lose my family. It's so hard being single. That's very true. It really is tough. - Thanks for the chat, Ma'am. - Oh, no problem. Sita's great, isn't she? She's very loyal. Loyal to the company. - Sita? - Yes. It's the reason why she doesn't get along with everybody. When she knows she's right, you can't bribe her no matter what. Really? That's good, right? Can't wait for you to meet them. Pa! Ma! This is Beth, my friend from school. Good afternoon, ma'am! Happy birthday, sir. Hi! - Have a seat! Have a seat! - You can sit down. - Give your guest something to eat, okay? - Okay, Ma. Your classmate is very pretty! Yes, isn't she? Thank you so much. - Would you like something to eat, Ma'am? - Oh, sure, sure. Conrado! Happy Birthday! Mike! How are you? - My accountant. - Happy Birthday! Hello! Thank you! Love, I'll leave you to it. Hi! - Sit down. - Have a seat. Come with me for a sec. Hello, how are you? Sir? Sir, here are the documents that you need to sign for tomorrow. And you have a board meeting tomorrow with Sir Mike. And... I'll be heading home. Ah, it's already six o'clock. Has everyone left? Sir, nobody's left. They all went home. Okay. Okay, check the rooms and make sure everything's locked. - Okay? - Okay, sir. So then you can go. I still have a lot of work to do. Yes, sir. Sir? What? Take care. Thank you, Sita. Goodbye, Sir. Hello! Hello! Yes? Are you Beth, the friend of my daughter? Yes, it's mhee! How are you? Belated happy birthday. Sir? Yes, Sita. Sir, I'd like to remind you of your board meeting at 11:00 a.m. Okay, okay. Get the conference room ready and please tell the Accounting department to be present. - Noted, Sir. - Thank you, Sita. Thank you. Are you busy? Hey! Who are you talking to? You seem all giddy! - We're too young for that! - It's just a crush. Do I know him? Maybe. One of our classmates? Nope. From a different class? Possibly. You love making me guess! Is he tall? Tanned? Maybe. He's kind, handsome? He's got gorgeous eyes? Let me see that! Hey! I'll show you if I want to! Don't be so pushy! How's your day? Still busy? Why are you not responding? Okay I will not disturb you... Hey! Sorry... Yeah just busy at work... Stop messaging me... Hi, sorry late response... That's okay. How's your day? I'm good... you? Fine, still in your office? Yes? Why? You work too hard? you should relax sometimes. Thanks, okay i gotta go! Bye! Going home? Yes, my wife is waiting... Ouch! Trying to make me jealous? What?! hahaha... you silly kid! No, I'm not a kid anymore! Yes you are... like my daughter. Yup maybe, but my mind is like your age... Want proof? What do you mean? Yes, Love. Want me to get you something on the way? How did you know? Can you drop by the grocery store, love? I'll text you what I need. Love you! Alright, text me a list so I don't forget. I love you, too. Okay, guys, another job well done! Good work, team! And to celebrate, Sita and I discussed your bonus. Yes! That's what I'm talking about! Okay! Okay! Okay, guys. Tomorrow, sir Mike will be in charge of you. Okay! Melba and I have some business to attend to. So Mike will head the project in the mean time. Hang on, Conrado. Do you mean to give Ana a little brother? Is that what you meant? Not exactly! Everyone back to work if you want me to prepare the bonuses. Okay! Should Sita ever gets married, I'll pay for the roasted pig! That should keep her from being grouchy! She's such a grouch! You're too much, Sir Mike. Karen, your phone's ringing. You should answer it, it might be a client. Okay, come on, let's go. Hello... R and E Realty. - Hi, Sir! Congratulations! I want to say goodbye. I'll be sending a resignation letter tomorrow effective in fifteen days. For everyone's peace of mind. My husband and I are back in good terms and I wish you well, too. Hi, Sir. How are you? You must be very busy! Send me a picture, won't you? - Bro. - Yeah? You look jumpy. No. Take a look at our plans for the BGC project. Damnit! You're always playing hard to get! Hi, sis! How are you? I'm okay! Let's hang out! No, I can't today. I'm waiting for Mama's call. Alright! I'll ask Len if they wanna go to the mall. - Bye, sis! - Bye, sis! Sita! I need Sir to sign something. But his door is locked. And the blinds are drawn, too. Looks like he's busy. Okay. He must be taking a nap. This can wait till tomorrow. I can't hear anything. - Yeah, maybe he took a nap. - Alright. - Ma'am? - Yes? May I use the restroom? I think my tummy's upset. Huh? Want me to go with you? No, nevermind. I can manage. Alright, you'd better go. You don't want to make a mess in here. You're something else. What happened to you? Huh? What happened to you? My tummy's all weird. Ask for medicine at the clinic. Thank you. I'm okay. Sure. Beth? So? Are you feeling better? I brought you medicine and a glass of water. Thank you! Thank you, Ana. I'll feel much better later. I'm glad I got in just in time! If it doesn't improve tomorrow, you should just skip class. Ana, I appreciate this. You're really my bestfriend. Another glass, Ma'am. Yes, please. Love, I'm really sorry. My stomach's acting up. I thought the toilet bowl has swallowed you up. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sita is agitated because Mike's running the office today. I'll just put her at ease. Alright, sure. Thanks Daddy! You're the best! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I love you, I love you. I love you more, my Love. Happy Birthday! Thank you. What the hell, Carla! So you just pop out of nowhere?! You bitch! Hello! You gave me your keys, remember? What, are you still having those nightmares? These nightmares have clung on to my life. But they're not as bad as they used to be. I don't get them as often. Are you drinking your meds? You idiot! Do you think I'm a loonie? I'm serious. I meant your anti-depressants. Of course! You ask me as if you actually care! You know I worry about you. How's school? It's okay. I like it better here. It's quiet? I don't want to go back to our old place! Well, expect that I'll visit you from time to time. You don't even drop me messages anymore. That's why... Ta-da! Surprise! I'm here! Right! You gave me such a fright! You almost killed me! Oh, stop messing around! But it's true? I really do worry about you. Hey, baby! I'm sorry. How was your day? Wow! You're such a naughty girl! I'm driving! What's wrong with you? Oops! Sorry? I just miss you. Okay, okay. Jeez? you got my little man all wound up! I should go. Bye! You're distracting me. You silly girl. She's taking forever! Who is it? I can't take it anymore! My goodness, Beth! What the hell were you doing in there? You even locked the door! We're about to wet ourselves! So sorry! I didn't notice that I locked the door. I just got out of the cubicle. - Ugh! - Sorry, girls! I can't take it anymore! What's that? Medicine for my migraine. And I get bouts of depression whenever I can't contact my parents. I see? Good morning, class! Good morning, ma'am! Okay, get 1/4 sheet of paper. I want us to see each other. Not just on video call. In person. We can't do that. What the hell... Shit. Shit. Her business sounds like a lot of fun. I'll check out your shop. Hello, sir! Oh, hey, Love! Come, let's eat! Pa, how was your day? It's okay. I didn't know Beth was such a clever girl and both her parents are living abroad. She has her own online business! What was it you said you were selling online? Oh no, I'm embarrassed to say in front of Sir? I'm selling undies. See, Ma'am, I told you. It's embarrassing for Sir? Gosh, Beth, maybe you should teach Ana a bit of what you do. So she doesn't waste all her time on TikTok. Ma! No! What Beth is doing is hard work. I want you to focus on your studies, do you understand? But Pa, I think it's exciting! You should teach me some time! Sure, I'll teach you some time. I know all about it! Are you feeling okay? It's probably just from work. Just tired from work. Going back, Beth. We?d love to meet your parents someday. They raised you well. For sure, your mom and I will get along very well. My parents aren't here in the Philippines. They're in Canada. My Daddy's name is Virgilio Calderon, and my mommy's name is Virginia. Are you okay? You don't have a fever, though. I think my husband just wants a cuddle. Please, Ma! Not in front of my guest! Get a room, you two! Oops! Sorry! I'm going to get it. You okay? Yes, I'll just grab some pills in the room. I gotcha! Alright, well, entertain your guest. I'll attend to your Dad. - Okay, Ma. - Alright. Nanny Tasing! They're sweet, aren't they? I hope someday I'll find a man just like my Papa. A man who loves his family. Me, too, I hope? Love! I'm going to get some water. I can't sleep. What the fuck-- Beth? What are you still doing here? Didn't Ana tell you? I'm sleeping over. What's that medicine for? Migraine. What's your purpose? Do you want to break up my family? Do you want me to make a scene? What do you want? You! You're the one I want. Don't you want me, too? I'm your baby! Beth! Beth! What's wrong with you? Our relationship isn't even real! It's all virtual! Come on! I love you! Beth! What's wrong with you? Have you lost your mind? You saw my wife, right? You saw my daughter? You're even friends with her! You know what? Okay, it was all my fault. I am sorry. Let's just end this. I recorded a video of every single time you masturbated to me! What would your precious family think when they find out that goody goody ol' you is actually a pervert! Don't you dare! Don't you dare! You'll regret crossing me? ?Daddy! Hi, Daddy! See you tonight! I'll text you which hotel we're meeting at. Don't worry, they won't notice that I'm still a minor. What color would you like me to wear? Red or black? - Hello, Love. - You have an emergency trip to Baguio? Take care, okay? I love you. Good luck! Thank you. Sir? I already informed Ma'am Melba that you have a meeting tonight in Baguio. In Baguio. Okay, Sir. So you're going to Baguio, Daddy! Ana messaged me, she's inviting me to your house. If they only knew we'll just be somewhere nearby. See you soon! This is what you want. Alright, I'll play. Until you'll be the one begging me to stop. What took you so long? Come, let's have something to eat first. If I'm hungry, I'll go home to my wife. Cheers. See you later... Hi, Virgilio! This is Conrado, the dad of Ana, Beth's classmate and good friend in school. Would you mind if I extend my hand of friendship to you and your family? Let me know if I can call you? Best Regards! I don't mind this setup as long as we're together every 15th and 30th. You want to do it here. Answer me. Are you ignoring me? Sorry, just a little busy. My business is having problems. Hey, why aren't you asleep yet? Sita is messaging. So annoying. Tell them goodnight. I really enjoyed Father's homily this afternoon. Two wrongs don't make a right. Where'd Ana disappear to? She came home late again, I bet? Oh, didn't she mention she and Beth are hanging out today? Don't want to meet with me? I'm with a friend right now. Maybe I should tell her about us. Ah, Love. I just have to deal with a client. It's an emergency! It's an emergency. I just need to deal with this. Go on home. I'll call you right away. I'll be home as soon as I can! What? Beth! Don't try anything stupid or I'll kill you! You'd better behave! Move it! Beth! Beth. Ah, you're here. Beth, what the hell, where's my daughter? I'd like you to meet Carla. My friend. She's the one I was telling you about. Hello! So it's true... You're very attractive. Beth. What are you playing at? It's nothing! I just thought of changing things up a little bit. I thought maybe you were getting tired of just the two of us. So invited a third person. After all, this has always been one of your desires, right? To be in a threesome. I think it's too much for him to take in. Promise? if you let my friend join us this time, I swear I'll never bother you again. You'll be a free man. You men are all the same! You're a bunch of animals! Opportunists! All you do is take! Beth, don't kill me! Of course not! Why would I kill you? What a waste? I did love you. I thought you were the one. But I was right, wasn't I? This is the last time we'll see each other. Papa, please, enough... This is what true love looks like! Hello! Hello!
