A Toho Pictures Film Thursday, May 17th, 1973 Special Derby Edition, Five Facts Regarding Haiseiko Scoop! Tomoko Ogawa to Wed! With a 30-year-old Music TV Show Producer The Black Battlefront Kidnappers What do you want? I went to headquarters today. I met with Onimaru. I hear you went against the chief's orders as well. The lawyers are making a big deal. Think about the position the Chief and Onimaru are now in - as your superiors. So what am I supposed to do? Simply apologize. Three day laborers who migrated to Tokyo died. All because the construction company was cutting corners. Unless you have hard evidence for the prosecutor, we have no case. What are you doing?! You creep! Wh-what are you doing? You work at Waseiko? You're a respectful businessman. I'm sorry. Please just don't tell my company. - OK. I'll let it slide this time. - Akira... Dad, let's quit the force. Stop talking nonsense. Akira! You're leaving pretty late today, sir. Security Room My secretary is still here, so please look after her. What are you doing?! Hello? This is New York calling. Is this Pop Cola? Hello? This is New York. Receipt for: Pop Cola Japan President Keisuke Shimozawa. - The Black Battlefron Hello? Miyako's Bar Leaving this in the kitchen? There we go. That idiot, growing his hair out like that. Hello? This is Funaki. Funaki Senior. The Funaki from the Ginza precinct. Akira? He is... A kidnapping? What's up with you? You seem off today. You think I could be of any use? - What do you mean? - You're looking for a bartender, right? Don't be silly. If you were a bartender, you'd scare away all the customers. They'd warm up to me... You're actually... Serious? You'll quit being a cop? Hello? This is Miyako. Mr. Funaki Hey. It's probably your father, isn't it? I'm not here. I don't want to tell him that. It's no big deal. You idiot! What's a detective doing hanging around late at night? Does it matter what I do after work? It's that work I'm calling about. Listen up. We just got called to come in. Fine. I'll be right there. What is this? Black Battlefront? No idea. Public Safety just started looking into it. They think they may be connected to a radical group. The woman's a secretary. And the other two? They're executives. - Any trace of the perps? - Onimaru's working with the local police. OK, then. Stay here, and wait for any phone calls until everyone gets here. This is a kidnapping of a famous person. Don't do anything hasty. Chief. You're saying that because I've caused trouble? In kidnappings, the most important undertaking is reading the kidnappers' first move. Any calls will likely come to this number. If the incident with me is still an issue, go ahead and officially discipline me. I'll deal with you in due time. For now, just do as you're told. - Chotaro. - Yeah? At that time of the day, there's still a large crowd of people. You don't know which way they went? No. We were inside the room. Well, let's go take a look. NO PARKING I think the incident with Akira's calming down now. Right. The chief put him through the wringer, but he's finally getting off with a warning. That idiot. Making nothing but excuses. The world keeps changing bit by bit. Things were different back when we started as detectives. He's known you since he was a baby, yet he's still caused you so much trouble. You're lucky you don't have kids. Me? I still want one, even at this age. - Hello? - This is the Black Battlefront. These are our demands. You understand Japanese? - Do you? - Yes. I do. We want you to publish the data for Pop Cola's secret formula in tomorrow's papers and on TV. We want it published in the Toyo Keizai, Time, and Maicho Shimbun newspapers. If there's no publication, the president's a dead man. - Our secret formula? - Can you publish it? Don't be ridiculous! That data is the very lifeblood of our company. What's the meaning of this? These are our demands. Money. Their true intention is to shake us down for money. Isn't that right, Chief? It bothers me that they call themselves a radical group. What benefit is there for them in getting that data? They may have some motivation other than money. - Nonsense! - Hold on. It's a ship. There's also the sound of a train. If it's been 2 hours since the kidnapping... They could be anywhere around Tokyo Bay, where there are trains running... That doesn't help much. - These are the victim's undergarments. - OK. Taro, get a good sniff. Hopefully we can at least figure out which way they went. Indeed. Search. Taro, search. Search. This doesn't look good Think all the exhaust fumes are ruining his sense of smell? Any developments? How's the investigation? Where are they? Maybe they escaped by car, after all. There's one thing I just can't figure out. What is it? At 8 o'clock, they could have left from anywhere in the building. They could have even left from here. Why would they go right past the security desk? Search, Taro. Maybe they passed by to make it apparent the president was being kidnapped? They even mentioned the secretary to the guards. There's just something about it that bothers me. Is this the Ikebukuro police? Put the station chief on the line. Tell me! What is this all about? First... Your life. Which will Pop Cola decide is more important? Your life or their business data? You're all blinded by greed. You think the world will never change, but... Execution. Pop Cola President Keisuke Shimozawa. On May 21st, at noon. - The Black Battlefront. Please pull over. Let us through. What are you doing? Keep your mouth shut. Quiet! - Open it. - Hurry! - Take the chain off! - Hurry up! The bullets! Where are the bullets?! Why were you keeping quiet about it until now? This is a matter of life and death. We ask for your cooperation. You believe the same group's behind the Ikebukuro case? They're claiming responsibility for it. Two rifles and two other guns were taken in the Ikebukuro case. - Is that correct? - Yes. You still don't know the whereabouts of Pop Cola's president? We'll be holding an official press conference in an hour. At any rate, the investigation team has just been formed. - Chief! - Chief! The 21st is a Monday, isn't it? Just 3 days away. We have less than 70 hours. These guys actually plan on picking a fight with the police? Hello? It's from the head office in New York. Hello. Yes, this is Imai speaking. Yes, certainly. Japanese Police is doing its best in the search, but... Yes, sir, I understand. All right, we will. Goodbye, sir. The company will offer the kidnappers $300,000. $300,000? But they've only demanded the publication of the secret formula. The New York head office has ordered us to protect the company's image and secrets. I see. Let's inform the Chief of this. With this money, Pop Cola needs to put this case to rest. No matter what. Pop Cola can offer $300,000 if it wants. I have no say in the matter. But the police aren't just some middle man in a transaction. You can take out a newspaper ad to convey that message. We'll track down the kidnappers the way we've been trained to. Our company's doing all it can right now. How much is $300,000? - 80 million yen. - Really? No doubt about it. They used one of the stolen guns. How badly do they want to mock the police? Aoi. It might already be too late, but examine the car for me. Yes, sir. Funaki, check for prints and do some digging into the car's owner. Wouldn't it make more sense to look into Black Battlefront's true identity? - The car's bound to be stolen. - Public Safety's already on it. - But why don't we tackle it in the field? - Akira! We each have our roles to play. This has to be them sending a message. It won't matter if it's 70 million yen or 80 million... I'll get to it, then. Idiot! As if he knows everything. Chotaro. When the Pop Cola executive told us to end the case using money, it pissed me off too. I know what you mean. Those people think there's nothing money can't buy... Even the president's life. I guess we aren't in a position to tell them how to run their company, are we? Black Battlefront, Challenge in Broad Daylight Investigators on the Defensive Gun Store Also Attacked Bold Declaration of Execution In Broad Daylight OK. And did you find anything from the items left in the car? Right. I see. Is that right? OK. Please get back to us soon. Boss. About the car's owner... It seems the car was stolen from a Hibiya parking lot. And there was a police report filed, so the owner isn't involved. I see. It was stolen, after all. This is a report from Public Safety. Apparently, they're an extreme faction that split off from a radical group. So it turns out they were sending a message. Don't go saying things that'll piss off your old man. Onimaru. You didn't sleep last night. Why don't you rest? I'll be here tonight. OK. Boss. He's right. You can use the station's sleeping room. There's something that keeps bugging me. What is it? The way the president was taken out the building. Well, guess I'll go get some shuteye. I need to use the bathroom. What the hell? You see now? There's no need to escape. You're in your own building. Thank god! It's you! This woman is one of the kidnappers! Hey, what are you waiting for?! Just let me ask one thing. Why did you target our company? That's a difficult question, isn't it? Anywhere would've been fine. So long as they made lots of money. But then your eye-catching poster caught our attention. I beg you. Let's make a deal. Tell me your demands. I'll give you as much money as you want. Oh, you didn't know? The company already gave their response. Notification of Death Penalty for the President of Pop Cola New York Headquarters Makes Ransom Offer of $300,000 Taro. - Is that Haraguchi? - Stay put. Haraguchi isn't there. Get back here! Shit! Can you still leave the building? Good. We'll take care of him before the sun comes up. Don't let personal feelings get in the way of the revolution. Operating Room 2 It's too much to bear. Onimaru... He spent 30 years... Trying to... Make a difference in this world. For it all to end like this. According to police, the time of last night's crime was at approximately 11:00 PM. The key to solving this case appears to lie in Chief Onimaru regaining consciousness. It just doesn't make sense. The call came from somewhere along the bay. The incidents happened in Ikebukuro, Harumi and Yurakucho. They're all over the place. In any case, call in reinforcements. We're running out of time. I appreciate it. - Chief. - What is it? Please let me investigate Onimaru's case. You're from Onimaru's precinct? Yes, sir. Chief, please! Can't do it. It's being handled by the Tokyo Department. Aoi will take over from where Onimaru's squad left off. Your job's to wait at Pop Cola for the kidnappers' next move. Chief! There's no time! Onimaru took the police dog so he could look into how the president was taken from the building. He was in such a rush that he took the dog without following protocol. But the security guards are saying he wasn't there. Then he gets left for dead in Yurakucho. Don't you find it strange? That investigation's being handled by another squad. Please. You have to send me there. Enough! Do you realize you're abandoning your post? - Chief! - Knock it off! Get back to work now. So he wants to avenge Onimaru? He takes after his father. Here. Is it OK for you to be at home? We're alternating shifts. It's not like waiting by the phone's going to solve anything. Did you eat something? Did you eat already? I heard you said some pretty selfish things to the chief again. In front of the director. Yeah, I did. I asked him to let me investigate instead of making me sit by the phone. Those bastards are really going to do what they say. I'm appalled that the company's offering money, but the police department's no better. Both have no idea what's going on. If this were about money, they wouldn't have made such a ridiculous demand in the first place. Right? You're the same as the radical group, aren't you? You'll go after anyone, just like a wolf. We want Pop Cola to publish the data of their secret formula. The newspapers... Chief! We only have 25 hours left! What are you going to do? Any developments over here? We just had one prank phone call. We want you to publish the data for Pop Cola's secret formula in tomorrow's papers and on TV. There simply isn't any useful information coming in, is there? Chief. What is it? You can hear a car in the recording. The sound from the ship remains the same, but the sound of the car suddenly gets louder. And there are cars passing by right there. There's something strange about this phone call. It's from a phone booth. If the phone booth door opened while a tape recorder was playing, it'd sound like this. So what you're saying is... the location is actually somewhere close by. That gives us a lead on the location. We'll bring this data to the lab and they'll analyze it. Hello? - Hello? - This is the Black Battlefront. Since you're making such a generous offer, we've decided to accept the 80 million yen. We'd like you to have it ready in 30 minutes. Packed in a single light bag. We'll contact you again about the rest. Finally. Here we go. Chief. We heard an announcement for a Tokyo-bound train. Confirm it. Can you put the money together quickly? Not a problem. I've already copied the serial numbers. Now's our chance to finally have direct contact with them. We've received a call from the group. Yes. They've asked for the money. Chief. What's the meaning of this? I guess they were only after the money. Those bastards. I've been sent here by the station chief. We can't predict what they'll do, so we need you on the case. There should be a call from them soon. Akira. It appears you were wrong this time. Hello. Is the money all ready? It is. Pick up the bag from the desk and walk out the front door. Then lay out the money on the road, one million yen at a time. So we know the bag's not just stuffed with newspaper. They are somewhere... ...where they can see us. We'll call you again soon. Hey, look at all that money. Look, look. It's money. - What's going on? - It's nothing. Move along. - Whoa. What are you doing? - You can't be here. Get back! Please move out of the way! I've been a detective for a long time. But I've never seen this much money. We're good. The 80 million is all there. Put the money back in the bag and wait for our call. Wait! We exchange the money for the president. The president's alive, right? He's alive. But we can't exchange him for the 80 million. He'll be released once our safety is guaranteed. If not, too bad. Goddamn it! What the hell's going on? Dad. What's with that building? It's scheduled to be demolished. The money's packed up? Have someone take the bag to the patrol car that's parked out on the street. Just one, got it? - And then what? - You'll find out! We'll hold up our end of the deal. Make sure you hold up yours. The president... When... And where...? It's no use trying to prolong the conversation. If you want the president back alive, don't try anything stupid. The calls are all coming in from different locations. They want someone to get in the patrol car? Where the hell were you? I had a strange feeling someone was in that building. And? I found this. Don't go off on a whim. We're all being watched. One of us has to take the money and get into a patrol car. I'll do it. No. I want you to do it. The president's safety is our priority. We also have to figure out where they're planning to go. Understood? Yes, sir. Chief. I want you to follow behind him. Car #28 speaking. Go ahead. There's just been a 911 call from the Black Battlefront. They say they're going to contact us via 911 calls from here on. Over. This is Dan, Chief of Investigations. Be in constant contact with Car #28 and inform us of its location. Yes, sir. We just received another call! I'll repeat it to you. Head down Harumi St., toward the Police Department. - Over. - Police Department? OK. Please maintain contact with this car. - All right. Let him take this car. - Yes, sir! I'm off. Hold on a second. Give me your gun. Why would I do that? Give it to me. This is not the time to use it. Good luck. Car #28. Can you hear me? Car #28 here. Head to the Kasumigaseki intersection and make a left turn. Got it. I'll head to the intersection. Passing in front of the Police Department now. Got it. Director. Please contact me at the command center from now on. If he gets onto the expressway, we won't be able to determine his exact location. Please arrange backup. Car #28. Don't go too fast. You have to buy us some time. Got it. Head toward Shima when you get to the fork in the road. Over. Heading toward Shima. Haneda Airport? Either that or continuing on Kanjo-sen? If he passes police headquarters, that splits into Chiba, Mukojima, and Kanjo-sen. What?! He's off?! He got off the expressway? Now he's heading to Ginza! Ginza? The roads are closed to traffic today. We've received a new message from the kidnapper. He says he wants you to wait in front of the Wako building's windows. Got it. Try to buy some time. Investigators are now getting into position. Over. Will do. Listen. Make sure not to lose them in the crowd. Understood. You're the ones who hurt Onimaru. Pick up the bag. I'm disappointed you were only after the money. Shut up. Pick up the bag. So, let's go then. We're supposed to watch him. Let's go. Where's the president?! You're staying with us a little longer. Seems like your buddies are all over the place anyway. Is that so? They don't have the bag anymore. They went into the subway. Upstairs! Damn it! Go! What are you doing? I don't know what you guys are planning. But whatever it is, the odds are stacked against you. What revolution didn't have the odds stacked against it? Dad, shoot! You're his old man? How nice. A father-son pair of mutts! You coward! Damn it! You hurt our boss... Then you took the money. You call that a revolution? It's how we die. That's the revolution. Huh? Guys like you talk big, but in the end, you all give in! Shut your trap. Shit. See you later. Hey! Wait! - You have to call the conductor for me! - Is this a hidden camera show? Please! - But... - Hurry! Hey! Call the police! Please! The Black Battlefront gets away with 80 million yen in ransom money. Suspects fled Ginza, escaping from police. The hostage, Shimozawa, president of Pop Cola... Mr. Funaki, correct? I'm Miyazawa, a reporter. What do you want? I guess it's not your responsibility, huh? This is on the higher-ups. You were just following orders. What the hell do you want?! Everyone's saying the police botched the case, but I want to hear what you have to say to that. There's gotta be something, right? I'm covering the case. Hey! Hey! You know, we're just about to close... Just let me stick around for one more. OK. Do you run this place by yourself? Yes, I do. At a place like this, help doesn't stay around for long. You'll keep doing it on your own? I don't have much of a choice. I've gotta put food on the table. You're showing up quite late for a bartending shift. I heard on the news. Why didn't you pull the trigger today?! Because I'm your son?! In this line of work, there are times when you want to slaughter these lowlifes. Akira... But, we're just chess pieces. In chess, pieces can't accomplish anything alone. There are rooks, bishops... And pawns too. By the way, the chief says that you should take a break from the case. What did I do wrong?! People are going to talk about this for a while. It'll be difficult for you to do your job. Same goes for the police. Sometimes people end up like Onimaru. It happens. Maybe tomorrow you should go pay him a visit. Thank you for everything. Please take care of him. Thank you. Haraguchi. Run! Onimaru! Onimaru! You bitch! What was that about Haraguchi? Who the hell are you? Tell me! Spit it out! Haraguchi. Starting work now? Yes. I got here a little late. I see. I was wondering why it was in a different position sometimes. But now I know why. What are you talking about? You were late because you were at the hospital! Taxi! Hurry! Hurry! Damn it! Damn it! - I found where the kidnappers are! - Where are they? - In this building! - Where? In a room looking over the command center. Hey! This way! He's there! The president's there! Hey! They got him! It's dangerous! Please leave the area! Pedestrians, please keep moving along! It's dangerous! Please leave the area! Wait! It's dangerous! Please leave the area! Pedestrians, please keep moving along! It's dangerous! Please leave the area! Pedestrians, please keep moving along! Drop your weapons! You bastard! Kazama! You bastard! Goddamn it! Fuck you! Drop your gun! Give yourself up! It's over! Ayanokoji! It's up to you now! Dear citizens. We are the Black Battlefront. We ask all citizens of Japan to fight with us. Drop your gun! It's pointless to resist! Look above you. What's hanging above you is the truth. The president of Pop Cola died carrying the full weight of his company. Pop Cola decided to pay ransom money in order to save itself... ...at the expense of the president's life. Right now in front of your very eyes, you are seeing the true nature of a large corporation. Drop your weapon! It's all over! Give yourself up! We will not forgive the ways of these companies. The execution of Pop Cola's president is our first warning. This warning... Drop it! ...will cause a revolution. This is your revolution? Get up. Get up! I told you, revolutions are all about dying. If you can hear this, we are most likely dead. However, the act of us dying is our revolution. The way we have died will live on in someone's memory and... ...leave a faint trace. Hurry up and turn that off! One death will ripple and create 100 new soldiers, and thus, our revolution will never cease. We are waiting for that time to come. The enemy's weapons are vast. The authority they wield is great. We are feeble. However, when we are slaughtered by the authority, the revolution awakens. Akira. What are you going to do? Do you plan on quitting the force? Why on earth would I do that? If you can hear this, we are mostly likely dead. Dad. However, the act of us dying is our revolution. I'm going to Onimaru's wake.
