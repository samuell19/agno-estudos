CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] OO! OO! OO! BR-R-R-R-RR! OO! OO! OO! BR-R-R-R-RR! OO! OO! OO! WA! OO! WA! OO! WA! WOOoo! WOOoo! WOOoo! HOO hoo! WOOoo! OO oo! OO HOO! BR-R-R-R-RR! EEoo! CAW! CAW! CAW! CAW! CAW! CAW! CAW! CAW! CAW! [SINGING INDISTINCTLY] Man: THIS IS WHERE THE TOWN BEGINS. THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF CHANGES. NOT ALL SMALL ONES, EITHER. I THINK THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH ANOTHER ONE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S BOUND TO BE AT LEAST ONE PERSON WHO REMEMBERS WHEN EVERYTHING WAS JUST OPEN LAND, LIKE IT IS RIGHT HERE, AND SOME PEOPLE CAN JUST LOOK AT THE LAND--JUST LOOK AT IT-- AND TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED THERE. THIS WHOLE AREA WAS ONCE UNDER WATER-- ALMOST STILL LOOKS LIKE IT. AFTER THAT, THERE WAS A PERIOD WHEN DINOSAURS ROAMED ALL OVER THE PLACE. I USED TO BE FASCINATED BY DINOSAURS WHEN I WAS A KID. A LOT OF KIDS WERE. RECENTLY, THE BONES OF A WOMAN WHO LIVED 20,000 YEARS AGO WERE FOUND HERE. THEY NICKNAMED HER MIDLAND MINNIE. THE FIRST INHABITANTS HERE REFERRED TO THEMSELVES SIMPLY AS "THE PEOPLE." OTHER GROUPS THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH WERE REFERRED TO AS "FRIENDS." TEXAS COMES FROM THE CADDOAN WORD FOR FRIEND. HOWEVER, THE CADDO WERE AMONG THE FIRST TO BE WIPED OUT BY EARLY WHITE SETTLERS. A GROUP OF SPANISH SETTLERS OFFERED THE INDIANS A CHANCE TO BECOME SLAVES. THE INDIANS THOUGHT ABOUT IT, DECIDED IT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA, AND KILLED THE SPANIARDS. THE SPANIARDS FOUGHT MEXICANS. MEXICANS FOUGHT AMERICANS. AMERICANS FOUGHT THE WICHITAS. THE WICHITAS FOUGHT TANKOWAS. TANKOWAS FOUGHT THE COMANCHES. THE COMANCHES FOUGHT EVERYONE. MEANWHILE, MOST PEOPLE WHO NOW LIVED HERE SPOKE SPANISH. COVERT MILITARY OPERATIONS TO SEIZE TEXAS FOR THE U.S. OF A. WERE BEGUN IN 1835. EVENTUALLY, THEY DID GET TEXAS. LAND GRABBERS, RAILROAD COMPANIES MOVED IN. THE ECONOMY BOOMED. SOME PEOPLE GOT RICH-- FIRST ON COTTON, THEN CATTLE, THEN OIL, AND NOW, MICROELECTRONICS. THE SILICON-BASED TRANSISTOR WAS FIRST PROPOSED HERE IN 1949. IN 1958, MR. JACK KILBY INVENTED THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT. HE WAS WORKING AT TEXAS INSTRUMENTS THEN. HE DOESN'T WORK THERE ANYMORE. THIS IS THE 150th ANNIVERSARY OF THE STATE OF TEXAS. PRINCE CHARLIE, DUKE OF WINDSOR, PRINCE OF WALES EVEN CAME HERE FOR THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OPENING CEREMONIES. THIS OUT HERE-- THIS IS VIRGIL, TEXAS. THEIR CELEBRATION'S GONNA HAPPEN THIS FRIDAY. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A PARADE THAT RUNS DOWN THE MAIN STREET IN THE MORNING. AND THEN OUTSIDE OF TOWN THAT NIGHT, THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A TALENT SHOW. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] YOU KNOW, IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, THIS'LL PROBABLY ALL BE BUILT UP. [MUSIC PLAYING LOUDER] RADIO RECEPTION'S GREAT HERE! ALTHOUGH THE CENTER OF TOWN IS PRETTY OLD, AROUND THE OUTSIDE, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVING IN, A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION. PLUMMET RIGHT. STEADY! 5.32. MOVE ON. THIS IS WHERE THE STAGE FOR THE PERFORMANCES IS GONNA BE BUILT. IT'LL ONLY TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS BECAUSE IT'S ALL PREFAB. THEY'LL GET IT DONE JUST IN TIME, I HOPE. DO YOU THINK THERE'LL BE ENOUGH PARKING, HUH? 4.50. GOOD. MOVE ON. BE THERE SOON. [CLICK] MANY OF VIRGIL'S FESTIVITIES ARE SPONSORED BY VARICORP. IT'S A MAJOR PUBLIC RELATIONS EFFORT. THEY'RE CALLING IT A CELEBRATION OF SPECIALNESS. BUT THIS PLACE IS COMPLETELY NORMAL. ANYWAY, THIS IS THE VARICORP BUILDING JUST OUTSIDE VIRGIL. IT'S COOL. IT'S A MULTIPURPOSE SHAPE-- A BOX. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S INSIDE THERE. GOING TO THE KEG PARTY AT DON'S TOMORROW? LOVE MAKES EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL, LIKE A LITTLE PUPPY-- WARM AND FUZZY. YOU KNOW, I LIKE A HAIRY MAN. JESUS WAS HAIRY. IT'S WORTH IT TO FALL IN LOVE, TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD. LOVE IS SOFT AND LOVE IS PURE. LOVE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU MUST ENDURE. LOVE IS PEACEFUL AND LOVE IS WILD. LOVE'S ALL RIGHT IF IT LASTS A WHILE. I KNOW EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT LOVE, HONEY. I HAVE SEEN IT ALL AND DONE IT ALL. I LOVE MONEY, AND MEN LIKE THAT. REMEMBER WHEN I WENT OUT WITH BURT REYNOLDS? SHOOT, HE WAS GONNA QUIT THE MOVIES AND LIVE WITH ME. I SAID, "BURT, DARLIN', I NEED ALL YOUR MONEY." HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO ME. DON'T BE AFRAID. I'M GONNA TOUCH YOUR NOSE. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO BE? UM, YOU SEE, I CAN READ YOUR TONES. EVERYBODY HAS TONES. IT'S LIKE EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN STATION, LIKE A TRANSMITTER. I GUESS YOU HAVE YOUR DIAL SET. BABY, I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS A RADIO. I'M PICKING YOU UP. YOU'RE SORT OF COOL, SORT OF...HHHOT! ?? BABY, YOUR MIND IS A RADIO ?? ?? THE RECEIVER IS IN MY HEAD ?? ?? BABY, I'M TUNED TO YOUR WAVELENGTH ?? ?? LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT SAYS ?? ?? IT'S A TRANSMITTER ?? ?? DA DA DA DOOM ?? ?? I'M PICKING UP SOMETHING GOOD ?? I LIKE IT. I LIKE IT. SEEMS TO BE A DIFFERENT KIND OF ATTITUDE. YEAH. SOMETHING'S HAPPENING HERE, ALL RIGHT. THE WORLD IS CHANGING... AND THIS IS THE CENTER OF IT RIGHT NOW. OR THE ONE OF MANY CENTERS. IT'S A LOT LIKE MUSIC. COMPUTERS ARE LIKE THAT. YOU CAN NEVER EXPLAIN THE FEELINGS OR CONNECTIONS TO ANYONE ELSE. FIGURING SOMETHING OUT, SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER BEEN UNDERSTOOD BEFORE, IS A RHYTHMIC EXPERIENCE. STEVE JOBS SAID THAT. HE USED TO BE THE HEAD OF APPLE. [BUZZ] THANKS. YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE IN THE COMPUTER BUSINESS CAN BE PRETTY CREATIVE, UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL BUSINESSMAN. YOU KNOW, THE ASTRONAUTS DIDN'T READ POETRY. BUT THAT'S CHANGING. HI, GARY. THIS IS AN EXCITING PLACE TO WORK? YEAH, I GUESS I'D SAY SO. COMPUTERS ARE AS MUCH A MEANS OF EXPRESSION AS LANGUAGE. HI! MY NAME IS LOUIS-- LOUIS FYNE. I'VE BEEN WORKING HERE A NUMBER OF YEARS. NOW I'M IN THE CLEAN ROOM. IT'S PRETTY OK. I GO OUT AT NIGHT. I'M A DANCIN' FOOL! HA HA! HA HA! I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. WHEW! I LOVE THE WOMEN. HEY, THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS JOB. NO OFFENSE, YOU UNDERSTAND. I'M NO SWINGER. NOT LOUIS. I WANT TO SETTLE DOWN. IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL. HEY, THESE MACHINES ARE GREAT. THEY'RE AMAZING. I TRIED A COMPUTER DATING SERVICE ONCE. WOUND UP WITH A MIDGET. I MEAN, I'M NOT A FUSSY MAN, BUT...WHEW! LOUIS, TELL ME, DO YOU LIKE CHILDREN? THEY'RE LOVELY. WELL, DO YOU KNOW ALL THE KIDS' NAMES BY NOW? UH...WHAT, ARE THEY SITTING ALPHABETICALLY? I WANT SOMEONE TO SHARE MY LIFE. MARRIAGE IS A NATURAL THING, AND I'M A NATURAL MAN. LOUIS, I'D LIKE TO TEACH YOU THE LOTUS POSITION. MOONSTONE, I'D LIKE TO LEARN IT, BUT I SIT ALL DAY AT WORK, SO I'M NOT FLEXIBLE. JUST TAKE ONE FOOT, PLACE IT ON THE OPPOSITE THIGH. GENTLY. THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME YOGA POSITION. WELL, IF IT'S AWESOME... TAKE THE OTHER FOOT. THIS ONE GOES HERE, VERY GENTLY. NO, CAREFUL, CAREFUL. VERY GENTLY. HERE, LET ME HELP YOU. NO, NO. THAT'S A DIFFERENT POSITION. BACK THIS WAY, LOUIS. THERE. OH, YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL. GOT IT? IT'S CLOSE. VERY GOOD. WELL, I SUPPOSE THESE FREEWAYS MADE THIS TOWN AND A LOT OF OTHERS LIKE IT POSSIBLE. THEY'RE THE CATHEDRALS OF OUR TIME, SOMEONE SAID. NOT ME. YOU KNOW, AROUND HERE THEY HAVE NAMES FOR THE VARIOUS KINDS OF FREEWAY DRIVERS. THE SLINGSHOTTER. THE ADVENTURER. THE MARSHMALLOW. THE NOMAD. AND THE WEAVER. YUP, IT'S FANCY DRIVING, ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, THINGS THAT NEVER HAD NAMES BEFORE ARE NOW EASILY DESCRIBED. IT MAKES CONVERSATION EASY. I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN CITIES... BUT I FORGOT WHAT IT IS. I HAVE IT WRITTEN DOWN AT HOME SOMEWHERE. [HONK] YOU LIKE MUSIC? OH, I KNOW. EVERYBODY SAYS THEY DO. LOOK. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE... I CAN SEE FORT WORTH FROM HERE. MOST PEOPLE AROUND HERE HAVE EATEN DINNER ALREADY. DON'T WANT TO BE LATE. KNOW WHAT I MEAN? OR DO YOU? YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS. THIS MIGHT BE PART OF VIRGIL'S CELEBRATION OF SPECIALNESS... OR IT MIGHT NOT BE. YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT ON TELEVISION... OR MAYBE YOU MISSED IT. HOPE YOU DON'T MIND LOUD MUSIC. ALL RIGHT, FRIENDS. WELCOME. CRAZY CAJUN TALKING AT YOU IN VIRGIL CITY TONIGHT WHERE EVERYBODY ALWAYS HAS A GOOD TIME. WE'RE GONNA PASS YOU SOME OF THAT GOOD TIME TONIGHT. IN THIS DRINK, THEY MIX 6 DIFFERENT KINDS OF LIQUOR, BUT IT DON'T TASTE TOO STRONG. WOULD YOU LIKE A RAFFLE TICKET? THEY'RE $2.50 FOR THE CAR. THANKS, OLA. D.J.: YOU, YOU ARE THE VIDEO... I FEEL LIKE GETTING DRUNK TONIGHT. HOW ABOUT YOU? WHEN I WAS A NURSE IN VIETNAM, I WAS STUCK OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JUNGLE WITH THE REAL RAMBO. HE HAD THE HOTS FOR ME. I MEAN, HE WAS DRIVING ME CRAZY. OF COURSE, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ANYBODY NOT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU IN THAT HUMIDITY. AND I SAVED HIS LIFE ABOUT 50 TIMES. I BET YOU'VE SEEN ME HERE BEFORE. RRROAR! HA HA! I'M THE DANCING BEAR. HI, LOUIS. YOU GONNA DANCE IN THE SHOW ON FRIDAY? YEAH, BUT... EXCUSE US. I'M STILL HAVING TROUBLE WITH LADIES. BUDDY, I'LL TELL YOU. FACT--THERE ARE 1/2 MILLION MORE SINGLE GUYS THAN THERE ARE GALS, AND THE COMPETITION IS TOUGH. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME. DO IT TO IT. MOST OF THEM JUST WANT TO SWING OR AREN'T REALLY SERIOUS. SOME OF THESE GALS ARE AS BAD AS THE GUYS. THAT'S MINE, THERE. I'LL TAKE THE RED ONE. WE GOT A SONG COMING UP CALLEDWILD, WILD LIFE. I WANT YOU TO LIP-SYNCH IT. WAIT! NOT NOW. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MYSELF. SEE, I'M CUTE. HEY, RAMON. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. PARTYING? YEAH, A LITTLE. WANT ME TO READ YOUR TONES, MAN? YEAH.

IF I EVER WENT DOWNSTAIRS, I MIGHT BE SURPRISED, HUH? IT'S CLEAN DOWN THERE, ISN'T IT, ROBERTO? THAT GIRL DOES A GOOD JOB, DOESN'T SHE? IT'S SO CLEAN, IT SCARES ME. THE BEAUTY OPERATOR IS COMING OVER. HEY, HOW SHOULD I HAVE HER DO ME THIS TIME? SHOULD I GET IT MOUSSED? OOO, LOOK AT THAT. THERE'S A LOOK. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE GALS ON THIS SHOW? THESE PEOPLE HAVE TOO MUCH METAL ON THEM, MISS ROLLINGS. THEY ARE REFLECTING KIND OF PEOPLE. YOU'RE RIGHT. HOW ARE THOSE SHARES OF VARICORP DOING? ABOUT 30, 40. IS THAT ALL? THAT'S ABOUT IT. WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED. CHEAP LITTLE PIG SHITS. IT'S THE SAME ALL OVER. BUNCH OF MANIACS OUT THERE. WOO! YOU KNOW HOW HOT DOGS COME 10 TO A PACK AND BUNS IN PACKS OF 8 OR 12? YOU'VE GOT TO BUY 9 PACKS TO MAKE THEM ALL MATCH UP. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. [TV PLAYING] SINCE THIS MALL OPENED, C.R. ANTHONY, JCPENNEY, AND EVEN DUKE AND AYERS ALL PULLED OUT OF DOWNTOWN VIRGIL. SHOPPERS HERE GO WHEREVER THE BARGAINS ARE, WHEREVER IT'S CONVENIENT TO SHOP. THEY DON'T CARE IF THEY SHOP IN A FUNKY OLD BUILDING DOWNTOWN OR IN A CLEAN, MODERN PLACE LIKE THIS. SEE, THEY'RE WISE TO ADVERTISERS' CLAIMS. IN A PLACE LIKE THIS, THEY CAN COMPARISON SHOP. EVERYBODY COULD HARDLY WAIT UNTIL THE MALL OPENED... EXCEPT MARGIE ORTIZ. I GO THERE ALMOST EVERY WEEKEND. SO DO 2 OTHER GIRLS FROM WORK. SEE? I TOLD YOU. THE SHOPPING MALL HAS REPLACED THE TOWN SQUARE AS THE CENTER OF MANY AMERICAN CITIES. SHOPPING ITSELF HAS BECOME THE ACTIVITY THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER. AND HERE, THE MUSIC'S ALWAYS PLAYING. WHAT TIME IS IT? NO TIME TO LOOK BACK. Men: HA HA HA! "STARVING PEASANTS SELL THEIR BODIES TO VAMPIRES FOR BLOOD MONEY!" HA HA HA! STORES HERE ARE PRETTY CLEAN. THE AIR IS FRESH. THERE'S PLENTY OF PARKING, PLENTY OF SPACE TO WALK AROUND. HI, HOW ARE YOU? HOW COME YOU'RE NOT AT WORK? OH, I'M WORKING ON A PROJECT AT HOME. I SEND SIGNALS UP. OH, TO SATELLITES AND THINGS. FURTHER THAN THAT, I HOPE. OH. HEY, I'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK BEFORE ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. OH. SEE YOU. PEOPLE HERE ARE INVENTING THEIR OWN SYSTEM OF BELIEFS. THEY'RE CREATING IT... DOING IT... SELLING IT... MAKING IT UP AS THEY GO ALONG. DRIVING... NOT ONLY DRIVING, BUT PARKING. HEY, THERE'S LOUIS! HI, HOW YOU DOING? PRETTY GOOD. DID YOU HAVE ANY LUCK AT THE CLUB? THE WOMEN ARE TOO WILD. I HAD A GOOD TIME ANYWAY. LOOK AT THESE WOMEN. YEAH, A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I THOUGHT I'D CHECK OUT THAT FASHION SHOW. PART OF THE CELEBRATION. TWINS. CAROL AND DARYL. I KNEW THEIR MAMA IN HIGH SCHOOL. SHE WAS A TWIN, TOO. HI, TWINS. I JUST THOUGHT I'D CHECK IT OUT. MAYBE I'D PICK UP A FEW FASHION TIPS. YOU KNOW, I'M VERY AWARE OF MY APPEARANCE. I'VE NOTICED. YEAH. WELL, JUST CHECK THESE OUT HERE. THOSE ARE GREAT! YEAH. [SQUEAK SQUEAK] YEP. LIKE THE SONG SAYS, IT'S A SCIENTIFIC LIFESTYLE. HMM. I DON'T KNOW THAT ONE. P.A.: GOOD AFTERNOON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND WELCOME TO ANOTHER LOVELY EVENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF SPECIALNESS. TODAY WE HAVE A FASHION SHOW, AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING YOU'LL JUST LOVE. IT'S VERY UNUSUAL. SO COME ON! LET'S BRING ON THE SHOW! FROM THE DREAM FACTORY, A BONANZA OF BEAUTY! THIS PLACE IS FILLED WITH WOMEN. Kay: I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU THERE'S ANOTHER EVENT THIS FRIDAY NIGHT.... THAT'S KAY CULVER. FOR THE CELEBRATION OF SPECIALNESS. SHE'S MARRIED TO EARL. YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM. HE PRETTY MUCH SINGLE-HANDEDLY BROUGHT VARICORP TO VIRGIL. YOU KNOW, I BET THIS MALL WOULDN'T BE HERE IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM. OH, YEAH? I'M HAVING DINNER WITH HIM LATER. WELL, LISTEN. I HEARD THAT EARL AND KAY HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ONE ANOTHER IN YEARS... AT LEAST, NOT DIRECTLY. DO YOU BELIEVE IT? OK. WHAT TIME IS IT? IF EVERYONE NOTICES, MAYBE IT'S TOO MUCH. BUT WHERE WOULD WE BE? $29.95 IS A PRETTY GOOD PRICE. WITH 6 OUTFITS AND AS MANY COMBINATIONS, THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS. SHOPPING IS A FEELING. SOMETIMES I GET A WOBBLY FEELING. I HAVE A COMMERCIAL FEELING. BE SEXY IN BUSINESS. BE SUCCESSFUL AT NIGHT. I STOLE IT OFF OF A SPACESHIP. ...AND COORDINATE YOUR OUTFIT TO MATCH. LET THE CHILDREN DO THE SHOPPING. IF THE ROOM IS PINK, YOU'RE IN THE PINK. YOU HAVE A RIGHT. IT'S ALL YOU. THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW. ?? WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE ?? ?? ?? YOU DREAMED YOU WERE BIG ?? ?? YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ?? A REAL TINY KID ?? ?? YOU WISH YOU WERE ME ?? ?? I WISH I WAS YOU ?? ?? DON'T YOU WAKE UP ?? ?? ?? THE DREAM WILL COME TRUE ?? EVERY DREAM ?? ?? HAS A NAME ?? ?? AND NAMES TELL YOUR STORY ?? ? ??

YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK I'VE FELT THIS WAY BEFORE. I KNOW. ME NEITHER. MY STOMACH FEELS ALL FLUTTERY. IT'S GREAT, THOUGH, HUH? YEAH, I--I GUESS. PEOPLE AT WORK MUST THINK I'M GOING NUTS, THOUGH. WELL, IF THIS IS BEING NUTS, THEN I DON'T EVER WANT TO BE SANE. AH. OH, DID YOU FART? I'M IN CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS. GOT WORK GOING ON AT 5 SITES NOW. BOUGHT ME A CONDO LAST WEEK. SHOOT, REAL CLOSE TO HERE, AS A MATTER OF FACT. NEXT WEEK, I MIGHT BUY ME ANOTHER HOUSE. DARLIN', I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I JUST HAVE A FEEL FOR IT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? OF COURSE, BEIN' OVERLY PSYCHIC SURE DIDN'T HURT ANYTHING. IT'S PAID OFF FOR ME. LISTEN, MR. FRYE, I'LL TELL YOU-- FYNE. LOUIS. LOUIS, DARLIN', I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHIN' IF YOU PROMISE NOT TO TELL ANOTHER LIVIN' SOUL. NOW, I'D NEVER TELL THIS TO ANYBODY ELSE, BUT I BELIEVE THAT PART OF MY EXTRAPSYCHIC ABILITY IS CONNECTED UP WITH THE FACT THAT I WAS BORN WITH A TAIL, A LITTLE OLD BITTY HAIRY THING ABOUT THAT LONG. HAD IT SURGICALLY REMOVED WHEN I WAS JUST 5 YEARS OLD. MY MAMA KEPT IT IN A FRUIT JAR UP IN THE MEDICINE CABINET BETWEEN THE COLD TABLETS AND THE MONKEY BLOOD. I'D GET UP EVERY MORNIN' FIRST THING AND GO IN THERE AND BRUSH MY TEETH AND STARE AT MY OWN TAIL AT THE SAME TIME. SOMETHIN' LIKE THAT CAN GIVE YOU POWER, AND THAT'S THE TRUTH. THEN MAMA GOT A WILD HAIR ONE SUNDAY AND SHE DECIDED TO GO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF IT. TOOK IT OUT TO THE SWAP MEET AND SOLD IT TO LYNDON JOHNSON'S TOP SECRET SERVICE AGENT. AND HE TOLD A GOOD PERSONAL FRIEND OF MINE THAT HE WAS GOING TO SELL IT FOR EVEN MORE MONEY TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE. I SAID HE MIGHT AS WELL. IT WOULDN'T DO HIM ANY GOOD. IT WASN'T HIS TAIL. GEE, I TELL YOU, I COULD WRITE A BOOK. THAT THING WOULD BE A BEST SELLER. YOU KNOW, THAT'S FUNNY YOU MENTIONED WRITING. I'M...KIND OF A WRITER MYSELF. IS THAT RIGHT? I WROTE ME A SONG I WANT TO DO AT THE SHOW FRIDAY. I HOPE IT TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS. DON'T BE NERVOUS. SONGS ARE EASY. I WROTEBILLY JEAN AND HALF OF ELVIS' SONGS. ELVIS? HELL, YES. THEY PAY ME, AND I KEEP QUIET. YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO IT. EXCUSE ME JUST A MINUTE, PUMPKIN. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OK? SURE. I'LL BE RIGHT HERE. [SINGING AN ITALIAN ARIA] Kay: SHALL WE TAKE A MOMENT AND GIVE OUR THANKS? HMM? AMEN. LINDA, WILL YOU ASK YOUR FATHER TO PASS THIS DOWN TO OUR GUEST? THIS LOOKS GREAT, MRS. CULVER. DAD, WILL YOU PASS THIS DOWN? OH, YES. LARRY, WOULD YOU PASS THIS DOWN, PLEASE? THANK YOU. LINDA, WOULD YOU ASK YOUR MOTHER TO PASS THE MUSTARD TO OUR GUEST, PLEASE? MOM, DAD WANTS THE MUSTARD. DEAR. THANK YOU. LOOK OUT FOR YOUR WATER, NOW. PASS IT DOWN TO OUR GUEST. LET ME GRAB ONE OF THESE. THEY'RE COLORFUL. LINDA, WOULD YOU ASK YOUR MOM HOW THE FASHION SHOW WENT? MOM, HOW DID IT GO TODAY? OH, LINDA, TELL HIM IT WAS JUST WONDERFUL, ALTHOUGH ONE WOMAN DID HAVE A ACCIDENT, BUT IT WASN'T ANYTHING SERIOUS. HE SHOULD HAVE COME. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD. IT WENT GREAT, DAD. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE. MAYBE NEXT TIME. I WAS THERE. I LIKED IT. I'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I'D NEVER BEEN TO ONE OF THOSE THINGS BEFORE. YOU DO THAT EVERY YEAR? OH, NO, THIS IS JUST FOR THE SESQUICENTENNIAL. YOU'RE IN THE PARADE? ANDERSON AUTO IS LENDING US A RED CONVERTIBLE. HMM. RIGHT. LARRY MAY HAVE A FUTURE AT VARICORP. WITH HIS YOUNG DISCIPLINE AND SYSTEMS CONSCIOUSNESS, HE COULD GO A LONG WAY, AND VARICORP IS GROWING LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I THINK IS GOING ON. DO YOU HEAR MUSIC? IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR SISTER? MAINFRAME. MICROPROCESSOR. SEMICONDUCTOR. ALL RIGHT, DAD! NOW... IF THIS IS THE TOWN AND HERE IS THE WORKPLACE... WITH ITS GOODS... AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK... VROOM! MOST MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE HAVE WORKED FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS LIKE VARICORP OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF, BUT NOW ALL THAT'S STARTED TO CHANGE. SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS ARE MOVING OFF FROM THOSE LARGE CORPORATIONS LIKE VARICORP. THEY'RE BEGINNING TO START THEIR OWN COMPANIES, MARKETING NEW INVENTIONS. EXCUSE ME, MR. CULVER. I FORGOT WHAT THESE PEPPERS REPRESENT. AH-HA! IT ALL SPINS BACK TO THE MIDDLE. HERE WE ARE RIGHT HERE, IN VIRGIL. OUR WAY OF DOING BUSINESS HAS BEEN BASED ON THE PAST. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO KEEP THESE GUYS IN VIRGIL EVEN THOUGH THEY LEAVE VARICORP. FOR THE TIME BEING, IT'S CREATED CONFUSION AND CHAOS! THEY DON'T WORK FOR MONEY ANYMORE OR TO EARN A PLACE IN HEAVEN, WHICH WAS A BIG MOTIVATING FACTOR ONCE UPON A TIME, BELIEVE YOU ME. THEY'RE WORKING AND INVENTING BECAUSE THEY LIKE IT. ECONOMICS HAS BECOME A SPIRITUAL THING. I MUST ADMIT, IT FRIGHTENS ME A BIT. THEY DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WORKING AND NOT WORKING. IT'S ALL BECOME A PART OF ONE'S LIFE. LINDA! LARRY! THERE'S NO CONCEPT OF WEEKENDS ANYMORE. Preacher: IT THRILLS ME. IT THRILLS ME! WE CAN BUILD A NATION INSIDE A NATION RIGHT WHERE WE ARE. THE CHOICE IS YOURS. I'M NOT A JOINER. I'M NOT A MEMBER OF THE JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY OR THE COMMUNIST PARTY, BUT LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE NATIONAL MORALS SINCE WORLD WAR II. WE LOST THE VIETNAM WAR. ?? ?? ?? THE MOVIES AND THE TELEVISION ARE FILLED WITH CHARACTERS I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW, NOT IN THIS LIFE. THE FARMER'S IN TROUBLE. THE SMALL BUSINESSMAN IS IN TROUBLE. UNEMPLOYMENT IS SKYROCKETING. TEXAS IS STILL PAYING FOR JOHN KENNEDY'S DEATH, MY FRIENDS. Woman: IT WAS LOVE THAT KILLED JOHN F. KENNEDY. HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER MESSED WITH ME. OH, NO, I KNOW NOTHING, YOUR HONOR. THEY WANT ME TO SPEAK ON60 MINUTES. MIKE WALLACE WANTS MY BODY. I DON'T TELL A SOUL. WELL, THEY GAVE ME SO MUCH MONEY, WHAT COULD I DO? UMM...THANK YOU. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. NOW, LET'S LOOK AT WHO'S BEEN RUNNING THIS COUNTRY SINCE WORLD WAR II. [BAND PLAYING] AND THEY HAVE SOME INVOLVEMENT IN ALL OF THESE. WHAT IS THE LINK? WHAT DO CARS HAVE TO DO WITH BOOKS, YOU MIGHT ASK. THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION WITH THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THEM? WELL, NEITHER DID I, UNTIL I NOTICED THE CHAIN OF COINCIDENCE. THEY HAVE MEMBERS ON THE BOARDS OF ALL THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS. NOT ONE DETAIL HAS BEEN LEFT OUT. AM I RIGHT? DO YOU FEEL IT? DO YOU KNOW WHAT BOBBY RAY INMAN WAS DOING BEFORE HE WAS RUNNING THE MICROELECTRONICS AND THE COMPUTER TECH CORPORATION? WELL, GUESS! A CIA DIRECTOR. IT'S PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. DO YOU RUN OUT OF KLEENEX, PAPER TOWELS, AND TOILET PAPER AT THE SAME TIME? YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE! IT'S ALL TRUE! YOU REMEMBER HOW GOVERNOR WHITE CAMPAIGNED TO GET THE MCC HERE? DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR GOAL IS, HUH? WELL, ELVIS DID! ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE! HUH? ROBOTS! THEY'D LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T THEY? YES, SIR! SLEEP! SLEEP! ONE AND ONE DOES NOT EQUAL TWO! NO, SIR!

WHO CAN SAY IT ISN'T BEAUTIFUL? THE SKY... BRICKS... WHO DO YOU THINK LIVES THERE? FOUR-CAR GARAGE. HOPE... FEAR... EXCITEMENT... SATISFACTION. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A CLEAR VISTA OF THE EDGE OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD. IT'S LIKE A GAME OF LEAPFROG. THESE HOUSES, THEY KEEP EXTENDING THE TOWN OUT FURTHER AND FURTHER EVERY YEAR. IT'S KIND OF WEIRD FOR THE FIRST PERSON THAT MOVES INTO A COMMUNITY LIKE THIS. I'LL BET IT IS. IT'S AN IMAGINARY LANDSCAPE, A PLACE TO RAISE KIDS. OF COURSE, NOWADAYS NOT EVERYONE'S HAVING KIDS, WITH THE END OF THE WORLD COMING UP AND ALL. I MEAN, WOULD YOU? NO, NOT AT ALL. NOT UNTIL AFTER TOMORROW, AFTER THE SHOW, HUH? GOOD MORNING, BOYS. WORKING HARD, I SEE. A LITTLE COFFEE BREAK? IT'S STRANGE WHEN YOU LOOK AT A FIELD AND YOU SAY, "NOW, I WANT A BATHROOM THERE AND A KITCHEN OVER HERE." NOW, IMAGINE THAT. HERE'S A FIELD. TAKE A LOOK OUT. PICTURE A HOUSE. PICTURE A LOT OF HOUSES. WHAT ELSE IS A FIELD GOOD FOR BUT BUILDING HOUSES? ?? ?? HEY, NOW ?? HEY, NOW, NOW ?? ?? I WANT A VIDEO ?? ?? I WANNA ROCK 'N' ROLL ?? ??

HEY, NOW ?? ?? HEY, NOW, NOW ?? ?? HEY, NOW ?? ?? HEY, NOW ?? ?? HEY, NOW, NOW ?? TEXAS IS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF METAL BUILDINGS. METAL BUILDINGS ARE THE DREAM THAT MODERN ARCHITECTS HAD AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY FINALLY COME TRUE, BUT THEY THEMSELVES DON'T REALIZE IT.

HE GOT BACK THE NEXT DAY, AND HE SAW THE GROUND HAD HARDENED LIKE CONCRETE. AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO BEGIN ALL OVER AGAIN. NO. IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM, HE HAD AN IDEA. HE SAID, "I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO. I'LL MAKE SOME PEOPLE THAT LIKE IT THIS WAY." [LAUGHTER] I WANT YOU TO WELCOME THIS FIRST ACT HERE. THEY'LL TELL YOU MORE ABOUT TEXAS IN 5 SECONDS THAN YOU'D EVER WANT TO KNOW.
