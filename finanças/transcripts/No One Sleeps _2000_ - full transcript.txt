No One Sleeps - You got up early, man. - I couldn't sleep, I have to run. I'll be seeing you, no problem, I'm on my way. This stiff can wait, am I right? Please, Louise, don't wake me up. Here or to go? One raw cow on the mayo ??? Watch your mouth, Jay Jesus! Where did they teach you ??? - When did you get in? - Just got here. They called about a half hour ago. ??? around here, ladies. Inspector Tolliver, Detective Finley. - Sergeant Flinter. - Where is he? In the bunker down here. Anyone touched the body? No, the medical examiners are still not here yet. I can tell you though, the guys didn't want to touch the body. The bastard was pretty sick already. This way, ladies. His name's Willy Darren, anti-viral, HIV. Cause of death: with strangulation. They cut him pretty bad doing it. Thanks, I can see that. Call pharmacy, see what else he was taking. He was maybe 120 pounds. He didn't have much time left, anyway. I hope at least he didn't see this coming. Make sure pathology finds out everything that was wrong with him. One of the homeless guys over there states to have heard a melody from an Italian opera. Tunadot, or something. I don't know much about opera. My ex forced me see a few. And? Turandot is the story about a princess who keeps chopping her wannabe boyfriends' heads off until they answer a riddle for her. It turns into quite an epidemic. Yeah, I got it, thanks. I've got Kaposis in the intestum, ??? quite clear What else? Darren has been on disability almost 11 years, but his doctors say he could have lived for decades, people don't die that quick any more. The landlady was a friend, she says he was depressed feeling useless just hanging around all day. I know the feeling. He was 32. Friends say he had serious problems with self-esteem and all that. Do you think the HIV is an angle? You could see it in his face, there was semen in the rectum. Why so much blood everywhere? There are lots of cleaner safer ways to get off. Maybe the perp's a born-again right wing type, has got cancer or something and don't give a damn. Or maybe he's sick too. He's sick, one way or the other. But it took some strenght to do all this. Maybe our guy's got HIV, but he's still healthy. For all we know, he could be lifting weights and using steroids. Well I guess that's always a possibility. Well, for sure it's no woman. You don't see a lot of women hanging around the outdoor cruising spots anyway. Not even the toughest dykes, right? No way. And the gay guys I know... would have left that place prettier. My research deals with the origin... origin ... origin of HIV. I assume you all know the work done by the biologist Dr. Jakob Segal in Berlin. He found evidence that an engineered virus was injected into human subjects. The truth shall make you free - Are you one of the grant students? - Yes, I am. - Name, please. - Hein, Stefan Hein. Hein, 8:45, small lecture hall, room 204. You know you're on in 5 minutes? The next guest invited to participate in the International Graduate Research Forum is... Stefan Hein, doctoral candidate at Humboldt University in Berlin. Good Morning. My research deals with the origin of HIV. I'm sure you're all familiar with the work done by the biologist Dr. Jakob Segal in Berlin. Let me just refresh your memony of the key points in Dr. Segal's thesis. Before you begin, Mr. Hein, in your opinion, what are the key points? Dr. Segal noted that a virus similar to HIV had existed for many years in sheep, and he reasoned that only by genetic engineering could this harmless virus have evolved into the virus that causes AIDS. He documented the existence of government- funded laboratories in America in the 1970s, that were built to develop biological weapons and were capable, however crudely, of the necessary kind of genetic experimentation. This is a very old theory that's never been verified. Dr. Segal built up a chain of circumstantial evidence that an engineered virus based on a sheep virus was injected into human subjects. Of course, no one could know the virus would have an incubation period of many years before it produced its devastating symptoms. Time went by with no apparent results and the experiment was called a failure. Then the prisoners were released into the general population. And how do you intend to accomplish this? Records like that are sealed by law for 30 years in the United States. Surely anyone directly involved would've been dead by now. The last time anyone took this seriously was in 1989, at the San Francisco AIDS Conference, before the Berlin Wall came down. And it's documented that agents of State Security from the former East Germany spread Prof. Segal's unproved theories around the world for reasons of political propaganda purposes. I know, but this doesn't discredit the theory at all. Well, Mr. Hein, do you have anything else to add? Since Dr. Segal's death, further information has been discovered. I think there is documentation of that experiment here. There must still be survivors of the experiment living in San Francisco and I'm here to find them. Thank you Mr. Hein, perhaps you'd like to take your seat again. Finally may I introduce Barbara Givens, from Harvard University. Bravo, very operatic. - Sasha. - Stefan. - So you are from East Germany? - Leipzig, but I live in Berlin now. Cute accent. [not the accent of Leipzig though] It was courageous of you to expound such a theory. And I must say that I found yours the most interesting presentation. - It's not just a theory. - Perhaps you're right. But don't you agree that we all tend to to find the truth where we most dearly like to find it? Look, here's my card, please call me some time. I'd like to learn more about your work. Hey. Do I know you? You're asking me? Oh, so you're a philosopher. Perhaps you'd be willing to educate an ignorant scientist by having a drink with him. I'm thirsty. Doing a research here? I do some research in the library tea room. I haven't even been yet to the library. You've got a crazy look. I like that. - That's jet lag and lack of sleep. - Who's been keeping you up? You know, visa problems, an unfamiliar bed in a new hotel room, losing half a day on Friday. Well, now I'm bored. ??? only takes you a minute, huh? Ok, I'm listening. Ok listen, I'm working on a research that my father started in '89. - They laughed at him for what he believed in ... - Where is your father now? My father? He's dead, of a heart attack. It sucks. Sad story, man. Listen, I have to go, I'll see you around. Yes, I remember, you're the guy from Germany, that's a wild theory you're working on. I don't think it's so wild, remember Tuskegee. Experiments on black people in the 60s. I don't think there's anyone here right now who can help you. The person you need to talk to is Charley Molina, but I haven't seen him around a day or two. He's a so-called volunteer, like myself, but you know, Charley's so gone underground. Charley's always talking about experiments and lists, but I just put that down to dementia. Girl, he's been answering the phones around here: "Jesus is the Light". People have been hanging up in droves. Ever since Carlos dumped him, that queen. How can I reach him? We can't give out the cellphone number, but we can call him and leave another message. But if you wanna talk to Charley, he's a party boy, check out the sex clubs, sex parties. Did he ever talk about what was on these lists? I cannot remember, but to be truthful, we have other problems. Like for instance, none of us are getting laid. Queen, please, I do not come here for no pay to be insulted! As soon as my nail's dry I'm gonna slap you. One of these is a list of everyone who was scheduled to speak in the AIDS Congress in '89, and then the ones who were left when the INS were steered ??? But if you're gonna check them here and now, you'll be busy. No extra charge. Brutal murder in the Presidio Whatever your good neighbor will tell you this is against nature and obscene, a rebellion against God's law, the full price is bound to be paid, AIDS is just a down-payment. That is what you get with special rights for gays. Keep America clean! You're kind of cute. I know some better place we can go, much better. It's private party. No, it's hot. You can come with me, I got some G. Ya? Have you committed any sins lately? Give us a minute and a glass of orange soda. I just happen to have some back in the kitchen. And give this one two doses. ... the studio? They took the names and addresses of everybody that was there. Imagine you were cruising out there, and these hetero cops giving you the 4th degree ??? - all the time pretty disgusting ... - It's so embarrassing! It all depends on how cute the cops are. Get out of here! They've already called the cops. You can't go in down there! - I know he's still around! - Well, he's going now. # Nessun dorma # Nessun dorma # Tu pure, oh Principessa # Nella tua fredda ... Hey! You! Get up! Out jogging again? Here ... Wipe it off. Thanks. I love your necklace. No doubt you have something to tell me. Listen, I didn't see it happen there, there are others out there who'd know more than I do. Unfortunately, except for the host who was busily trying to escape, you're the only one who stuck around waiting for us. Did you know the victim? His name was Charley Molina. Charley Molina? Yeah! I mean, not personally. I tried to talk to him today. What did you want to talk to him about? What did you want to talk to Molina about? And what were you doing here? I'm a researcher. Oh yeah? Were you doing research on Molina? Yeah ... no, I... Did you have sexual contact with the murder victim? Listen! I don't know anybody, I didn't see anything, everything happened so fast... I don't know! You were doing drugs? No, just beer. Turandot. It was playing at the time of the murder, the host swears it isn't his. Take his statement and find out where he's staying. What ... can I go? Of course. You can't keep hanging around here. This party is over. Hey. - What's that? - That's Turandot. Tom and I made the trip up here from Texas 'cause he wanted to see his favorite opera in his favorite opera house. You know. That story about the cold and icy princess who's so desirable, but nobody is able to get, and everybody's paid with death when they try to approach her. Out here I feel completely useless. Back home, I've been taking care of him night and day for the last year. Gave up my job. But here, the doctors comes to you. They even bring his food for free. The masseur on the other hand, he charges. But what the hell, I want to do him a favor. He doesn't like me. He just doesn't like sex all that much, unfortunately. I couldn't do much of a job. - Hi. - I'm Ron. - Stefan. I'm John. So... this is John, Ron, Tom? Tom, Ron, John? Hey, Tom. May I borrow one of your Turandot CD's? I'm staying just right down the hall. - Sure thing. - Right. Thanks. But don't disappear with that. I was with some friends the other night. Everyone but me was HIV positive. [Stefan Hein, Tauroggener Str. 12, 10589 Berlin] The other guys were talking about their blood counts and medication. I was uncomfortable and tried to make a joke about feeling left out. That maybe I should be infected too. Boy! Did that stop conversation. And then one by one they all told me how important it was that I stay uninfected. That one of us should be spared this disease. It blew me away. It seems almost unimaginable, that anything could come between me and this country to which I sense such a passionate link. And yet... # In questa reggia, or son mill'anni e mille, # un grido disperato risonò. # E quel grido, traverso stirpe e stirpe No rimming, no fucking, no sucking! No poppers or other drugs like crystal, crack, cocaine, LSD, ??? nothing that can make you do or decide or may encourage you to engage in unsafe sex. - All right, I got it. - And your signature here. It's 10 dollars. There's almost nothing they let you do anymore. Nowadays, only breeders are supposed to have all the kinky fun. What's up with this shit? You like a little risk with your fun? I'm not into positives. I can easily tell who is. How about you? A candle-like device and a thin face ??? Oh, the latest look in AIDS. What sign is your sun in? It depends on the weather, I guess. Let me guess... Pisces. I don't really know. It's got to be Pisces, I can feel it. My heartfelt condolences go out to you. Romantic, unrealistic, self-sacrificing. Naturally you'd be turned on by truly lost causes. Well, you hope ??? So you're a tourist as well as a doctor. - Do I look like a doctor? - Sure. You grab my balls and ask me to cough. - Keep it safe, boys. - Fuck off! Looks about death, looks about death ??? Let's get out of here. Do you have a place we can have a little privacy? - Sure Staying with friends or what? No, I got a hotel room, down the road ???. - What? You're talking about a fag hotel, nothing but fairies. Hotel Verona You're into uniforms or sugar daddies? No, it is my father. Some kind of general? No. Just great looking in a uniform. What's wrong with kissing? Why do you wear this? Why do I wear it? What kind of question is that? You don't like it? I hate it when people wear these things without even knowing why. - I wanna take a shower. - Sure, go ahead. # nessun dorma Where're you going? I just want to go out to get something to drink. I hate the diet stuff, if anything I need to gain some weight. You look fine like you are. You going out on the street dressed like that? This part of town you're gonna come back with 40 bucks and a chapped dick. Hey! Do you know what time it is? Lee's Restaurant - Café This is your box, and you can get your mail 24 hours a day. Alright. Thanks. Dr. B. in Fort Detrick 1973 - 1978. Biological warfare. - Do you mind if I come in? - Well, I obviously can't stop your, can I? You wanna get that fixed. I have a few more questions. Don't worry kid, I don't blush. So this is what your research is all about? I want to show that the AIDS virus originated in a laboratory, yes. Well, who can say? I've seen books claiming that AIDS isn't about a virus at all. That it's about too many gay men, playing too hard on crack, coke, poppers... you know, party favors. Are you from Homicide or the Vice Squad? Blame it all on the CIA if you want to. You're the scientist. Look, my father talked to people in San Francisco before he died. He saw documents, some kind of list that prove the US government used prison inmates as guinea pigs in a viral research as late as ... - Viral research? I heard that one way back when. So you're sure looking for those lists? And who besides your father is supposed to have seen them? Molina? We've already talked to your friends at "Act Up Golden Gate". Well, then you already have your answers, don't you? You say that you arrived at the club just before Molina was killed. Let's say Molina did see some list, maybe he did. It could with something that shot you dad's theory full of holes. If you think I'm involved in the murders, why don't you just come out and ask me? I'm very much busy. The witnesses I need for my research are dying, being killed. And I might not have much time left to get the information I need. And I do? I don't even know if this sicko only goes after men with AIDS. Or if it's enough to set him off if somebody's willing to have unsafe sex. Molina was killed because something he knew. So you think our Mr. X has a list of his own? And you think you might be on it? Do you mind if I ask you about your own HIV status? - You know it, don't you know? - I've been tested recently, everything's fine. Mail box address. That's certainly discreet. Excuse me, I didn't realize. Jesus! With tits like that no wonder you guys don't need women. May the Lord bless you and keep you! He makes me to lie down in green pastures. Who's the guy in that car? He's been followeing us all morning. He's FBI, in case this whole thing is bigger than California. Oh I see, just in case ... Hallo Jeffrey. Why are you running after me, Kraut? I heard you serve a great breakfast. Sure. Before 11. Do you always greet a new customer by dumping cases of beer in his face? One bottle would be enough. You've had your fun. I thought we both did. - But obviously you're easy to please. - You don't say! You left this on my floor. Not very subtle. Ah, the smart-ass, now man, you're really ??? about this one. What's the matter? Not butch enough for you? Listen boy, this is a coffee-shop, not a hotline for hysterical fairies. I thought this was a senior center soup kitchen. Hola, Russo, give me a bottle. Maybe that'll bring you down a little. Hey! That'll be a buck. Tip? Fuck you. You wish! Carlos? Hi, I'm Stefan. A friend of Charley's from the Act Up. I was told you come here often. Some people call me Saint Carlos. Charley's name was Carlos, too, you know, very confusing. Not enough, we were both Latino. Leather men, had a mustaches. It must have been hard for you towards the end when... Charley was deteriorating mentally. You mean the "Jesus is the Light" stuff? Charley wasn't into religion. It was the dementia talking. I guess, but he didn't always sound crazy. Did you hear the stuff about files and lists of names? Experiments on prisoners? It sounded he was really doing some kind of research. He never talked to me much about his work much. I'm sorry about what happened. They said I left him because he was sick. Maybe this will bring you down a little. You don't kiss? Get off! Caught red-handed. - What? - Something even you have to work. I found something about your father yesterday in the archive. After Wall came down, they really took him apart, didn't they? But then, he was actually running around saying the Pentagon created the H-virus on purpose. - He never claimed that. - Then what? When new biological weapons were developed, something was created with an unknown effect. But if through all kinds of investigations it comes out that AIDS is the accidental result of a failed experimment, so what? What good does that do in the end? Anyway... you have to stick with it. When I first came here, it took 6 months before I wrote one sentence. Too many distractions. I only have money for a month. Well, then ... best of luck. Thank you, Dr. Burroughs. Hey. Kraut, what do you want? Well ... My horoscope says today I convince one of my sharpest critics that he has the hots for me. Who tricked you into buying a leather drag? Come on. Get on. Where are we going? Alright, so we're just going. I like it out here. It's quiet. Nice place to rest. This is Colma. They moved all the bodies out here from San Francisco way back when. I used to know some guys who are buried here now. Not enough room in town for everyone, so ... party in SF and then they bury you out here. What have you bought ??? Don't worry, it's just change for the meters. You need to know for your fucking research? My mother was a cunt and my father was a con. Life's a bitch, Stefan. What do you want? What's between you and Burroughs? Don't show ??? me, what're you after? I'm looking for men who were in prison 20 years ago and were dumb enough to let the military shoot them full of HIV just to see what would happen. What're you fucking up to? - Just ask. - Just asking? Fuck you Stefan. I get fine ??? ten more like you, anytime, at headquarters. Shit! Let me swallow it. I want to swallow it. Christ! You can stay with him if you want. I'm done anyway. Stefan... Stefan! - Are you still tripping ??? - Do you know what? ??? So we're stuck here until they open again. Fine. Fine. At least we get a little time for ourselves. Don't worry, at 8am a guy comes in here to clean up. How do you know? Cleaning up here must be a real dream job. Sorry about that thing today or yesterday. That's alright, I got around. Can we talk? Or are you fucked up again? I don't like your smart-ass questions. I know what you're after. Why should those cons have agreed to be guinea pigs? So you thought about it. Well, I don't know. Maybe because they were promised they get out earlier. Even if they had a lots of time to do? Especially then, that's what I think. And some of them are supposed to still be alive? It doesn't add up. - You learn stuff like this in school? - Who's the smart-ass here? Why were you in prison, anyway? Yeah, I imagine. Must have been really hard, being queer in prison. Locked up with all those monsters reeking of old sweat. Ugly tattoos of naked women with huge tits. Cell door open, cell door closed. Bad thoughts ??? sleeping alone... Now you really have something to make up for it. In ??? you can have sex day and night. Besides, only the guys who take it in the ass are queer. Oh yeah, it must be great, especially for the new guys. Almost like here. Is that your type, mud-face ??? under 20? And how was it with you? You run around with a sign "Hey, I'm gay"? My father was the first one I told. And what did he say? "I'm proud of you, my boy"? Tha's not what he said. He said: "It's your choice. "But don't forget it's the simple truth that homosexuals seldom know happiness in their lives. " And since then you've been out day and night, trying to prove him wrong. Listen, I don't have to prove anything to anybody. Then why do you do exactly what your old man did? Obsessed with the same old shit. And why don't you have a friend? And that's all you're really aiming for. I have my normal life, I have my normal friends. I even went out dancing with girls. Sex was something separate. Is that still the way it is? You tell me. I still can't get it together. You know, if I really like someone the sex usually doesn't work, and when I find somebody for sex I can't love him. It sounds stupid. I guess ... I guess I'm just afraid of loving someone too much, of being left alone, of dying alone. Why should you die? I don't know, it just came out that way. No one starts a friendship or falls in love with someone who's gonna be dead in a few months. Not unless they know they're gonna die too. Are you sick? You're not! Did you hear Puccini in prison? Come here. They say the killer hums it before he strangles his victims. It's the song in the night in Peking. When everybody's out searching to discover the name of ... an unknown prince for Princess Turandot. Nessun dorma! No one sleeps. If Turandot knows the prince's name before the sun rises, he has to die. If she doesn't find out, she has to marry him. You knew how to get out of here the whole time? So ... when will I see you again? Why? You really don't know me. Sure. You're a riddle. Bet it all on one card? Hello, stud. Rome, 1955. The sheer vigor and ring of Mario Del Monaco's voice strikes him magnificently. That's what Gramophone wrote. Inge Borkh, Renata Tebaldi and him, it's to die for. Hallo, Stefan. No more curtain calls from you, I'm not gonna be able to take your readings. I knew we'd see you again. The police were asking questions about you, you know? Only the police? Nobody else? Turandot is the gayest opera of all, don't you think? All those handsome princes, lining up for her... and the things says to them: "No man will ever possess me." "And stranger, you who are in love with death..." The princess has three questions she asks her suitors. The first one is, what is born every night only to die in the morning? - Well... I kinda win the price ??? - And the answer is: Hope, always doomed to disappointment. How true! The second is: What leaps forth like a flame, cools in peace and glows in victory? What ??? we're using it. Blood my dear, blood. Interestingly enough, Puccini died while he was working on this opera, of an unknown, incurable, infectuous disease. Quite a kindred spirit, wouldn't you say? - Yeah. And the third riddle? What is ice that inflames you, ice that generates fire? Ice that inflames, that generates fire? Well ... I guess the princess would have had my head. Don't tell him. It all depends on whether you're in love or not. So... are you? I need to go to my mail box. When you're finished can I have a ride? Sure, I'll be with you as soon as I'm done. Ok, thanks, I'll just grab my stuff. - Sorry. - No problem. John, I wanted to ask you something. Have you ever thought about who would have wanted to kill Charley? I think Charley's gone to one party to many and ran into the wrong playmate. When exactly was the last time you saw him? About two weeks ago at the Buena Vista Hospital. It's funded by the Christian Soldiers, but it's well equipped. Go ahead, go ahead. They even take a couple of AIDS patients, there's ??? to be made in AIDS patients. Tell me! And there's no hospital in San Francisco that dares not to take AIDS patients. Charley was there for about two weeks, you know. It was after that that all that "Jesus is the Light" crap started. What's the point about the place? It's right on Castro Street, you can see what's going on with your friends under cover in the sickroom. I'm sorry, I'm late for an infusion, I'll give you a ride later. See you. Dr. B. in Fort Derrick 1973-78 awarding Dr. Georg Hein for honorable scientific research Dr. Richard Burroughs, Buena Vista Hospital You're supposed to take things out, not to put them in. Are you sure? God bless. # Straniero, ascolta: # Nella cupa notte vola un fantasma iridescente. You again. Don't you ever sleep? You said Molina has been killed because he knew too much. Who would have an interest in that? Conservative people who want to blame HIV, the Christian rights, the American ... Ok, I got that. Considering that, you'd be the first one to be in danger. Don't you worry. Nobody gives a shit what I do here. The lone shooter. And privately, who are you hanging out with? Is that any of your business? Yes. I have no lover. And before you start following me day and night, I'm still hanging out with a guy who does not kiss. Sometimes I wish it one ??? without kissing more often. Well, you shouldn't spend all of your time in gay sex clubs. - Excuse me. - Yes? I would like to visit my cousin. - What's his name? - Jeffrey Russo. I'm sorry, we don't have anybody by that name here. But he must have been patient here. Last hospitalization ended December 5th. Jeffrey Russo, born in Baltimore, March 16, 1960. Baltimore, Maryland? Is there another one? What did he have? I'm sorry, I can't disclose that information. Thanks. Excuse me... - I'm looking for Dr. Burroughs's office. - Dr. Richard Burroughs? You're in the wrong section, Dr. Burroughs is in Neurology. Dr. Burroughs isn't here today. Where can I find him? As you may know, Dr. Burroughs holds most of his consultations in his downtown office. But today he's at the directors' meeting at the Opera Guild. But who are you? Never mind, I gotta go. Funny ??? we keep running into each other so often? People could get the wrong impression about us. I wouldn't have any problem with that. Your people were very nice enough to honor my food vouchers. - I have to say, the food here... - Would you please tell me why? Sorry. I'm not allowed to discuss the nature of our interest. Not even with me? It's got to do with an investigation beyond your jurisdiction. Beyond my jurisdiction? If you'll excuse me a moment, I'd like to go get another one of these delicious pies. Son of a bitch. SECRET - Fort Detrick Biological Weapons Division I've been at Grandvue Hospital. Burroughs is at the Opera House in a directors' meeting. Molina was a patient of his quite recently. So was Darren, it turns out. And get this: Prof. Witkins accepted your friend Stefan into the GGU summer session without consulting admissions. And guess who's one of the private sponsors? Burroughs. Curious, huh? Buy two cheap tickets for the opera premiere and give one to Stefan. - Two? - Yeah. One plus one. Hey, how are you? Coffee? No. I've been thinking about it. What is born every night only to die in the morning? It's hope, right? What spreads out like a flane and is not fire? It's blood. And the third riddle Turandot asks ... Yeah? Does Burroughs pay well? Are you spying on me again? Is this insurance in this place or has Burroughs paid for your mess ??? Fuck you. Charley Molina was treated in that hospital too, you knew that? And maybe he learned something there. You have to depend on Burroughs. I don't care if there's anything wrong with your health. I just want to be with you. Are you crazy? I'm sorry. Turandot asks: What is ice that makes you burn? Ice that causes fire. Figure it out yourself. This is the end of it. Don't come back here anymore. It's better for you if ... we don't see each other again. No parking. Fire exit. Thank you. Inspector Tolliver? You've sent for me? I'm Dr. Richard Burroughs. I'm investigating two recent murders. We established that both victims had AIDS and were patients at the Buena Vista hospital. They hadn't just been treated for physical symptoms. They also spent time on your neuro ward. I've read about the murders, of course. And I would have hoped that those these men, informed as they were of their condition, would have avoided promiscuous sex. Would you have preferred that they simply avoided sex altogether? Perhaps in the future we should arrange that such patients don't leave the hospital at all. - Pardon? - A little joke. I can read minds. Well, you weren't reading mine. There are such things as condoms. Why were those men in neurological treatment? My dear woman, condoms don't solve all problems. Tell me, inspector... what do such men do with their dark and their sleepless nights? With their feelings of regret, of revenge, fear of the truth? Would you prescribe condoms for those things as well? For what neurological disorders were you treating those men? I don't have the name of everyone of my patients in my head. But if you send a list of names to my office, I will gladly have them looked up for you. Oh, and inspector, one question... Do you believe in God? Is it possible not to? Nein! Scheiße! Did you see anybody come by just now? Just you. Here's something for you. We do not mind guys in uniform here, but real cops make us really nervous. It's nothing terrible, it's just a ticket to the opera. From a cop? Hey, Tom. Look! I'm also going to see Turandot. If this damn fever doesn't break by evening, I can forget about the premiere and the opera ball. Have you figured it out? What I still don't get is, why does she kill her suitors? Thanks. - For revenge! - For what? Revenge for violence a 1000 years before. That doesn't make any sense. She kills anyone who dares to want her. And the victims are turned on by that. The riddles are three, and one is death. The murdered men all had AIDS, right? Mr. Turandot takes revenge on himself, on his own lust. He wants to love, but destroys the men who desire him. He kills what he wants and fears the most: devotion. They killed another guy! What's going on? They found another one a few blocks away. ??? the police station. I'm leaving for Palm Springs. The team is gone, they took everything down with a fine tooth comb. The murderer must be able to go through walls. The body was found in a cellar which was locked from the inside. At least that's what the owner says. And he's running an illegal club. - Nail it down tight, officer. - Ok, we will. And check out the victim's medical history. There's that vulture again! Christ! Hi guys, I'm Roger. I'm a sexual addict. As most of you know, I had a relapse over the weekend, but I just wanted to say it at the group level. I'm feeling a lot of shame. I can't stop thinking about this guy I made it with in the park. I didn't get a good look at his face, but he was so beautiful. So beautiful... # Tu, che di gel sei cinta, # da tanta fiamma vinta Your name? Stefan Hein, for Dr. Burroughs Do you have an appointment? He asked me to visit him. I'm sorry, I don't see your name on his calendar. Stefan Hein from GGU. [Golden Gate University] Stefan Hein from GGU for Dr. Burroughs. Dr. Burroughs has left for today. Next time maybe you should call first and save yourself a trip. Thanks. So we meet again, Mr. Hein. How is the research coming along? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I know you met my father, And now you want to find out how much he knew and how much he told me, right? I found your hypotheses interesting. And I must say, I think the reason for your visit was touching, such loyalty to your father... The reason for my visit was the lists. Ah, the lists! Driver, move on. Germans are so fascinated with lists, your father too as I recall. Even if the lists exist, what could they tell us? About certain research subjects, with no home address even then, whom it would be impossible to locate today? Implying that some may still be alive, or were until recently? Like Molina? Oh, we can still get in touch with Jeffrey Russo, can't we? Or have you forgotten him? Oh yes, Jeffrey. We were friends of a sort once, yes. I showed him something of civilized life. I suppose he took me for what he could. Quick though, in his own way. I hear he's developed quite a taste for the opera. Italian blood, no doubt. Did you enjoy the time that you spent with him? How do you know? May I ask you, are you HIV positive as well? Oh, Jeffrey couldn't tell you that? You have these men on your conscience, don't you? And you're suggesting that I... Apparently I've over-estimated your intelligence. Even if I cared, I wouldn't have to do anything. Homosexuals are busily destroying themselves. What do you do to the people who come to you desperate for help? I do my best, in hopes they won't cause any more damage than they already have. After all, Mr. Hein, AIDS is communicable. Well, how did you aid Jeffrey Russo when he was your patient? Jeffrey Russo and I might not be the friends you suppose. But I've done my best to calm that kid's dark troubled soul. Jeffrey would never have been able to afford the tests and medications without me. Sure. He's quite a sick boy, you know? And I really can't give him more time. - I've got him into the most promising clinical trials. - Once a guinea pig, always a guinea pig. Yes, and once a low-life ... You killed those men at Fort Detrick. Jeffrey couldn't tell you that? Driver, would you pull over to the left, please. Herr Hein, I'll let you go here. I'm sure there'll be a bus to take you to town. You'd better get your shit straight. Stop murder! Who put a straight woman on this job? Someone else should be handling your press releases. And your hair! Shame! Shame! Shame! You saw Hein this morning. Yes, so what? I'll see him again tonight at the opera. Don't you wonder what he was doing at the warehouse? He seems to attract corpses! ??? Do you think he's just a harmless conspiracy nut? You don't believe anybody could be suppressing information about the origin of HIV? The moral majority, the Christian Right... So... I guess you want me chase off after those rumors about lists. I'm not saying the kid's wrong or right. Our interest is only in Mr. X Don't forget that. Happily married homos? Senator Atwood Funds Homosexual Conversion Group Conventional forces and American defense policy Atwood... Senator Michael Atwood. At the books again. You East Germans are more energetic than people say. Sorry, I don't have time now. Because of your work? Prof. Witkins at least doesn't think you show much interest in it. It could be, but as far as that goes, he isn't much different from his colleagues. On the contrary. One of your colleagues told me today that Prof. Witkins knew your father. And was very active in trying to bar him from speaking at the 1989 congress. - So? - So what? Haven't you ever asked yourself why Prof. Witkins invited you to the summer academy? Thanks. We put a lot of effort into this, hundreds of people have done this for weeks. - new place ??? - ??? I have come to San Francisco to find evidence that the AIDS virus was created by scientists who work for the American government. I've found proof, but the witnesses are being murdered. - What was that all about? - I don't know. Hey, Tolliver. I didn't know this was a personal invitation. - Where did you get the camouflage? - I lost a bet, ok? Listen, I have to talk to you. What about? Everyone who is anyone is inside that hall right now. Including a few friends of yours like Dr. Richard Burroughs. And you'll be interested to know, he's with former Senator Atwood. Michael Atwood, Head of Ways and Means from '74 into the Reagan era, glory days for biological weapons research. So you're starting to come around? But what I don't know... Stefan, this morning I had the feeling that you knew the murder victim personally. Now who is seeing conspiracies everywhere? Listen, give me a minute, I'll be right back. Richard, it's so nice to see you. Thank you so much for having us. I know we're late, I am sorry. # Nella cupa notte vola un fantasma iridescente. # Sale e dispiega l’ale ... Slow down! Slow down! A naked kid running down Polk Street? And? - Did Stefan come back? - No, it seems he missed the premiere. # e tutto il mondo l’implora! # ma il fantasma sparisce con l’aurora # per rinascere nel cuore! # ed ogni notte nasce # ed ogni giorno muore! Patient report - XY experiment This is a final report on ..., a subject in the biological weapons "XY Experiment" conducted at Fort Detrick ... Das gibt's doch nicht! Molina, Charles T. Molina... William Darren And Jeffrey. I would like to speak with Inspector Tolliver, please. No, just tell her I called. Stefan Hein. Stefan, who were you calling? Jeffrey, they're after me, they're after you too. I cannot go back to the hotel, I have to go to the opera. - Sir Francis Drake Hotel. - That's not where I wanna go. Relax. Listen, Jeffrey. It was Burroughs, I know what they did to you, I know everything. Can you hear that? Can you turn that up? # Gloria! And it's an image of harmony at this moment at the War Memorial Opera House, as if the icy years cruelty have blown away. What rooms do you have for tonight? We're having a celebration here tonight for the opera's premiere of Turandot. The double rooms have been booked. I'm afraid there are only three single bedrooms, and one executive suite. We'll take the suite. I'll pay now. Cash. - You got a big tip or what? - Quit wise-ass questions. At least till after the wedding night. Not bad! Do you realize that I've spent all this time just trying to imagine what you look like completely naked? You know, typical Euro-body: Narrow shoulders, not much chest, but good legs. The kid said he tried to kiss the psycho, but the guy wouldn't let him. He tried to strangle him with a leather band. He's is still in shock. Hid for hours behind a dump ??? before he got away. At first, he didn't want to talk, claimed he had just had a problem with his fiancée. Turns out his father is a minister. He's terrified what can ??? to his parents. He that his name was Jeffrey. I tried to kiss him but he wouldn't let me. He called me pig and... said he was gonna give it to me. I said that he didn't have to because... I've been tested positive recently. He said, "That's why." He said, "it's pigs like you" "that got me in San Quentin 10 years ago" 10 years ago! Christ, I was only 10! Yeah, let me get two bottles of champagne... a bottle of your best red wine... I don't give a shit what year. and ... Yeah, let me get two Club Sandwiches. What? Yeah, Club Sandwich, that's what I said. Extra cucumbers. So... what finally happens to the Chinese princess? Her ice finally melts, and she and the prince love each other happily ever after. Lucky prince! Lucky princess. No punishment for all the men she beheaded? No. No punishment. I got to take a shower. It's the first victim Mr. X let get away. He's starting to make mistakes. Maybe you are getting raddled ??? Or maybe he's saving up for a big finale. The kid said the perp was raving about being in San Quentin. There've been over 100 Jeffreys there since 1980. Can't we narrow it down? Take a look at how many of them were transferred from any prison near Fort Detrick to San Quentin since 1975? - Fort Detrick? - Yeah, Fort Detrick, Maryland. I've got one. Jeffrey Russo. - Transferred from Baltimore, Maryland, November 23, 1978. - Why? Got a sentence reduced from 6 years to 1. His father was in San Quentin a few years before. It seems to run in the family. The old man died under suspicious circumstances. The D.A. suspected Jeffrey, but didn't have enough to make a case. They got him on drug ??? Yeah, come in. Hey. Thanks. Scheiße, Trinkgeld! - What? - I forgot the tip. Hey! Wait. Sorry, I forgot. It's for you. - Thank you sir. And may I say something, sir? - Sure. I like your jacket, sir. I like it too. It would look good on you. I need someone to deliver these papers to a mailbox PO Plus. I know where that is. - Can you do this for me first thing in the morning? - I can do it tonight. Good, it's number 5-12, it's important. Ok. Thank you, hold on... - Thank you. - Thank you. It is really important. Welcome to San Francisco! You're alright? Just having a nose-bleed. What took you so long? I was just making a date with the bellboy. I don't wanna lose you so soon, man. Don't worry. ... hold on, been here ... so incredible, you know Everybody was there ... - Mind if I sit here? - Please! Bill told me about your research. You know me. Always a day late and a dollar short. - You don't really believe that, do you? - I'm afraid I do. That the hell we go through every day was conceived by human minds? It's time for us to go now. This has been exhausting for you. Yeah, the party's over. John's conscience again. Wasn't the performance tonight pure heaven? Turandot was so superbly cruel. Estata una bellisima serata. Grazie. Sei Italiano? No, sono venuto da Detroit. Un lunga viaggio. # Nessun dorma! # Nessun dorma! # Tu pure, oh Principessa # Nella tua fredda stanza # guardi le stelle # che tremano d'amore # e di speranza # Ma il mio misterio e chiuso in me # Ed il mio bacio scioglierà il silenzio # che ti fa mia! # Il nome suo nessun saprà! # e noi dovrem, ahimè, morir, morir # Dilegua, o notte! # Tramontate, stelle! # Tramontate, stelle! # All'alba vincerò! # Vincerò! # Vincerò! If anyone asks you tomorrow, I was fabulous! - Senator Atwood? - Yes? You might as well admit it all. I have the lists. They were in Dr. Richard Burroughs' office. And they're in a safe place now. You're the young man from the Late Evening News. I really don't have time tonight for your radical absurdities. We just learned that Dr. Richard Burroughs was killed tonight. # ??? # ??? You had a bad dream. I'm here. You weren't here. You weren't here when I woke up. Don't ever go off without telling me again. Promise? Next time you'll be here? I'm crazy about you. Burroughs is dead. He put you on to me. If I'd known how close I was ??? Watched what I did ??? He executed those guys. ??? everything from you. But he was just using you. Believe me, Jeffrey is a good man. He's a charming mister, a man of faith. He should not leave those candles burning. Fuck! Obsessive Delusional. He's on some kind of twisted crusade. These are old presciptions. He must have stopped taking his medication. Close to his final exit. He seems to be collecting wallets. Tolliver, take a look at this. Willy Darren! Molina! Stefan! Jeffrey? Jeffrey? Are you in there? - Good Morning. - Good Morning. I got us Samosas ??? and crystal. This stuff is going to kill you! Something's got to. Why are you being such a downer? You're too old for partying day and night. Didn't Dr. Burroughs tell you? Fuck him. He's history now anyway. You knew him for 20 years and that's it? Jesus! That's scary. Love scares you, death scares you, crystal scares you. Jesus! You're a pussy. Come on. Do it up ??? Come on! Stop it! Stop it? Stop it. You dirty little prick! - Don't you get it? - Stop it, Jeffrey! Don't you get it? I killed the others for their own good. Burroughs... Burroughs Burroughs, I did it for you. For me? For me? Stop it! Do you realize I was right? It wasn't for me! He used you and you killed him, it was not for me! You're fucking sick in the head. Fuck you! Fuck you! Fucking sick in the head. So what now? You'll just go and fucking leave me? Stefan! You've caught me! Don't leave! Jeffrey... Jeffrey! You're right, it is the Drake. I'll wait for you at the reception, so I want you to get down here. No. Jeffrey... Jeff! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jeffrey! Police! Open up now! Let's nail him this time, Finley, come one. Check out the other room. Mr. Hein! Morgan, FBI. Brown, SFPD (San Francisco Police Dptm) - Youre under arrest! - Why? We have reason to believe that last night you unlawfully appropriated documents belonging to the US government. And that you were involved in the murder of Dr. Richard Burroughs. - What's that? - It's from my suitcase. Don't give me that crap! Let's go have a look in your locker. Read him his rights. You have the right to remain silent. Everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Do you understand? What number is it? God damn it! I don't read German. Charité Medical Faculty of Berlin Stefan Hein - HIV positive! Leave me alone with him for a minute. Listen... Listen, I was with Jeffrey all the time, We killed Burroughs together and we spent the whole night at the Drake. I'm not interested in your sex life. He was a hardened sociopath, capable of anything. Do you know how close you came? You've known all along that I was together with him. You just pretended to care about me. What are you going to do now? Lock me up? You have no alibi. If you say you were with Russo at the hospital, you'll spend the rest of your life behind bars. I will tell them everything! - I will tell them everything! - Shut ut, you fucking German queen! The German doesn't know anything, it's a waste of time. You never give up? Don't worry. I'm not here to ask for your work permit. What can I get you? What's that? A going-away present? Is he the reason you took the job? Or is it just one of the social benefits? He's not bad. Actually I think he's pretty ??? I'm not sure I can manage, but I'd like to stay in San Francisco for a while. So you're going on with it? My most important notes and documents are gone. It's all lies. I've read the newspapers. There is not a true word about Burroughs, about the files. Why keep blaming Burroughs? At least he believed that your theory could be true. He knew it was. Jeffrey had to be one of the last living victims of those experiments. Burroughs knew that too. You'll never know what went on there without witnesses. You know how old Jeffrey was? He might have missed the experiments by just a few years. And Burroughs was just an intern then. I closed the case. Jeffrey Russo, Richard Burroughs are history, as far as I'm concerned. You should not miss Turandot. It's the last performance. You didn't really get much out of it the last time. No way. Not all that much of a trick. Hey there, Kraut, your old man would have been proud of you, Still, you don't know it all. but then, work isn't what you really care about. Do you remember the first riddle? "In somber night an iridescent phantom floats, rises and unfolds his wings over the mean masses of humanity, Each implores and each is filled with longing for him, but at the rosy sounds of day the phantom vanishes, only to be born anew in every separate heart. Each night is born to die at dawn." It's Hope! Probably you're right, Kraut, it does sound pretty kitschy, Right now, I'm flying high. But I don't know about later. I would have liked to have been your friend. Hey! How're you doing? Fine. Just got a letter from an old friend. Well, you let me know when you're ready to start making some new friends. Nessun dorma!
