I'm a paramedic. - I got this. - Yeah, no, I'm totally fine. - Sir, what's your name? - What? - No, no, I'm fine. - Yep, you're okay. Do you need harissa? Hmm. Mmm! You needed harissa. Perfect. Let's boil. - Great. Actually... - Are you talking to your fish again? - No. - Uh-huh. I'm talking to my soup. Oh, okay. Well, I come bearing Eureka. Oh, my God, thank you. Yeah. That's just the type of friend I am. You just asked for lemons, but I know you like... Eureka! Yeah, 'cause you like doing that. Had to. Okay, wow! Casual at-home anniversary, huh? Ha ha. Rach, I love that you finally framed this. I will always love our firstborn. Even if that one critic did say the ambiance reminded him of a gas station. I personally like gas stations. They have really good snacks. God, you have such a good attitude. It's terrifying. Um, I need to change. Can you simmer the soup in like two minutes, please? Okay. You got, uh, food in your hair, by the way. - Yeah, right there. - Hmm? Oh. Oh. Yo, it's amazing what a mess you're capable of making. It looks like you taught a cooking class to a bunch of toddlers. Yeah, that's the vibe I was going for. Um, you should get going 'cause Gary's gonna be here around 7:00. Okay, so I guess I'll leave in, what, like two, three hours, then? That's hilarious. What are you, a stand-up comedian? I been working on a tight five. By the way, I saw his write-up in New York Magazine. - You did? - New York's freshest tattoo artist. I assume you helped with that? - Hmm. - Okay, I did. What? So I sent him a bunch of our cannoli. I was like, "Maybe you can put in a good word with the culture editor," - and they did. - Hmm. Aren't you generous. You can bribe people with cannoli. Good to know. Terri, you haven't said anything about my outfit. What do you think? - You look incredible. - It's a lot. It's a lot, but I'm thinking it's sort of giving off a J.Lo picking up her kids from school on the way to the Grammys vibe. He definitely won't notice this messy-ass kitchen. No, he won't. Oh, your phone's ringing. - Oh. - It's Gary. Looks like I'm having fish tonight. - Terri. - What? Hi, honey. You on your way? I'm sorry, who's this? What? I can't find it anywhere. If I help you find your phone, will you give me one as a thank-you? Don't start. And don't tell her, because you know she hates it. Hey, hey! - Aloha. - Mahalo. - Girl. - Oh, please. Like you've never seen Moana. - How is it going over there? - It's the best. All the trees are lit, we went ice-skating, and we saw a guy get hit by a car. - Oh, my God. - No. It was a good... really good day, minus the guy and the car, but he's fine, I-I think. You know, we could do it all again once you get here. No need. Yeah, I remember very well, you know, the crowds, the smells. I actually like all those things. - When's your flight get in? - Uh, tomorrow night at 5:00. What are you guys gonna do until then? Well, Daisy's gonna hang out with Nina, who she hasn't seen since the first grade. Oh, fun. Okay. Yeah, while Dad has his meeting. - What meeting? - Vanessa, margarita time! I'm coming. Okay, I have to go, but I will see you guys so soon with lots of presents, okay? Have fun on the last day of your girls' trip. So, here's the thing about not telling Vanessa about the meeting. What's wrong? You said you "think" that man's okay. Look, sweetie... the ambulance got there really quickly. But sometimes people aren't okay. What if he's not? You're right. I think he's fine, but in the morning, we can go to the hospital and-and check up on him. Okay. The doctor on call last night told me that he had a concussion. How bad is it? - How do you feel? - I've felt worse. Concussion's mild. You know, no broken bones. Maybe a bruise here and there. - That's it? - That's it. Damn it. - My phone. - Your what? It's cracked. Yeah, you're right. It seems like he's gonna be just fine. All right, well, Rita's got it from here. - Okay. - All right. Okay, so we're holding him for an MRI because he has some memory loss. Memory loss? She didn't say anything... You don't remember what happened last night? Not really. I mean, that can't be good. That sounds bad. Is that... is that serious? He's gonna be fine. So I should be getting seen any minute now, right? Uh, looks like not until tonight, um, worst-case tomorrow. - You should go. - No. I'm not leaving you here. Come on. Really. You should be more worried about my phone right now. Stop it. It's broken. I'm totally fine. You should be at the restaurant. Seriously. - You sure? - Yeah. Okay. - Bye. - I'm gonna take your stuff. This is it. Take good care of him. - I love you. - Love you. Hey, what's the snack situation here? Hmm? No, no, we're not family. We just... we wanted to check up on him. All we know is that he was hit by a cab. I'm sorry, I can't release information on patients, especially if you don't even know his name. Please. We just want to know if he's okay. All right? He came in last night. He was hit by a cab in SoHo. My dad brought him back to life. No. Um, no, that's-that's not... But you did. It was because of you. Excuse me? - That's not exactly what happened. - Hi. Hi. Sorry to interrupt. I just overheard you... Were you guys there last night with the guy that got hit by the taxi? You know you don't have to disclose anything. Oh, no, I know. His name's Gary. He has a concussion. - Oh, no. - Oh, but it's so small. - He's gonna be totally fine. Yeah. - Oh, good. We're glad to hear that. You hear that, D? What happened? Uh, I'm sorry, you guys can't linger here. If you want to finish this conversation, you're gonna have to take it elsewhere. - Are you and Gary married? - Uh, no, no. We're... We are... we're... - Best friends. - Well... Are you a stripper? - What? - Wow. Do you live in New York? Yeah, I live in, uh, Queens. What about you? But we used to live here, uh, and we might come back. Well, that's cool. You can work from either city. Bicoastal. Fancy. Uh, kinda. You know, I-I'm a creative writing professor at UCLA. - Cool. - But he's also an author, and he wants to write another book. All right. So, yeah. We probably should bounce before Rachel here leaves with our Social Security numbers. At least I didn't ruin the proposal. I heard nothing. I heard absolutely nothing. I'm losing it. I should go get some sleep, put on human... human people clothes. I'm wearing heels in a hospital. That is what I'm... doing. I got to go. Sleep sounds most important right there. - I think you're right. - Yeah, I think so, too. So, if you guys find yourselves in Bryant Park at all, my restaurant has, uh, a little spot in the Christmas market, and I would really love to properly thank you with a meal or... - Oh, for real? Yeah. - Yeah. What's it called? It's called Gillini. It's a bakery. - Bakery? - Uh-huh. And a restaurant in Little Italy. Hold on, now.

I guess print's not so dead after all. Oh, well, I'm hanging on for dear life. Have a seat. Let's see if we can get you back into the Simon & Schuster family. Okay, well, that's what I want to hear. Hold on. So you're not gonna open the box? No, no, no, I can't. I mean, I can, but... No, I can't. That's-that's not okay. That's worse than, like, going through someone's phone. But he's in the hospital. He won't even know. Terri, Terri, even if I opened it, I couldn't get it back to the way that it was. You know that tying bows gives me anxiety. My fingers... my... they're tiny fingers. - They don't work like that. - That's true. You did wear Velcro shoes until the seventh grade. But Sophia has a very artful hand. - Right, baby? - Damn right I do. Come on. I got to know what's inside. Inside what? Inside what? You act like I'm not gonna hang up and tell you everything. What if it is... what we think it is? I don't know if I'm ready for this. What do I do? I mean, hey, that would be more surprising than him having a secret love child or something, right? He has a secret love child? Terri. Okay. All right. So what's the plan? I don't know what the plan is. I guess the plan is that I'm gonna work until they schedule him for an MRI, and then I'm gonna run and pick him up. That's the plan. And the box? - Are we just glazing over that now? - No, no, no. It's just... The thing is, right, we don't know for sure, like, that it's a ring, right? They sell lots of things at Tiffany's. - What box? - Pens. They sell pens. And you know what? Actually, one time, I saw a yo-yo from there. It could be a yo-yo, Terri. Hell, if he got you a pen or a yo-yo, girl, you got bigger problems. I don't know. A Tiffany's yo-yo sounds pretty cool to me. Okay, I just got in the stall. I got to go. And I need 17 coffees. Okay, bye. Girl, it's a mess.

Uh, my late wife and Daisy, they used to bake bread together. Right around Christmas. Was she a baker? No, it was... the bread was awful. The bread was awful. - Bread is hard. - Really hard. I hadn't thought about it in a while. What was she... like, if you don't mind me asking? No. She was like, uh, like a song. Like a song that you wanted to play over and over again. The risk of love is loss, right? That's something my mom used to say. When did you lose your mom? Uh... I had just turned nine, so... Well, that's all the time that we have here, so... I'll invoice you. How'd you decide that this is what you wanted to do, though? Like, to bake. It was never really, like, a firm decision. I just kept falling more and more in love with it. It's like a meditation, it's a love language all in one. It's messy, but I just... I love that something beautiful always comes out of the mess. I like that. It's cool. I don't mean to pry. What was... what were you... Daisy was saying you're writing a book? - Another book, yeah. - Oh, so there was a first? Yeah, it was a disaster, the Titanic of books, yeah. I'm sure it wasn't that bad. Well, nobody died from it. You know, Gillini was not my first go-around. My first go-around, my first restaurant was a big flop. Huge. Embarrassing. Disastrous. Bankrupting. - You get the point. - Yeah. If yours was the Titanic of books, mine was the 127 Hours of restaurants. - Wow. - But Gillini... Gillini was always my dream, you know? Toss this out. Okay. Do you know what this is? A croissant. First of all, this is a cornetto. Okay. All right. Little-known Italian cousin of the renowned croissant. Thank you very much. You know why it tastes so good? Because it was baked with love, not strategy. - And probably a shit-ton of butter. - Oh, yeah. Maybe you need to start doing things with your heart. Not your head. Well, I do have this one idea that I... I really love. Tell me. What is it? I kind of got to show you to explain it. If you, if you have time, we could... I don't know, um... Yeah. I mean, I guess I have a little time. We could drop these off at the shelter and then check it out quickly. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that-that'd be great. Okay. My secret spot.

That is... Um, I was just trying to, you know, g-get to know him a little. How do I describe Gary? Gary is an artist. He's super talented. On the surface, he can come across a little self-absorbed, but there's so much more to him. Nobody stood by me quite like him when my first restaurant fell apart. He was amazing. I'm trying to think of what else. I mean, there's a lot to say. Uh... Oh! Another example. This bracelet was my mom's. I wear it everywhere. I do not know what I would do if I lost it. It's very precious to me. You get the point. I took the bracelet off when I was in the chair getting my tattoo, and when I got home, I realized I didn't have the bracelet. I panicked, I ran to the station, and there was Gary. He rode all the way out to Astoria. And I remember looking at him, being like, "Wow, this is the kind of guy that he is." So if I ever... well, when I get frustrated that he's late or misses dinner or is wrapped up in his own stuff or always on his phone, I remember that he's the guy that went eight subway stops out of his way for me when he didn't even know me. So, sorry. In the longest answer ever, yes, he is the kind of guy who would return five dollars. Wow. You really do have a thing for bread. I do. Yeah. I'm sor...

I bet it was your encouragement. Uh, I-I always encourage him, but, you know, you know Ethan. He just needs to forge ahead. You know, none of us have a crystal ball, right? - Yeah. - We just got to do our best. Uh, good to see you. - You, too. Bye. - Nice to meet you. - Bye. - Bye. Okay. God. And these are new. Taxi?

No. I actually haven't seen her since she left to meet you. Mm. Mm-hmm. You know what I was thinking about earlier today? - What? - The book you're gonna write. Ah, well, I hope I write it. What do you mean, you hope? It's a lot of procrastination mixed in with self-loathing. I've got a great therapist. You just got to go for it.

I recently got... engaged. - Mazel. - Thank you very much. And I-I just... I-I wanted to ask you, like, ab-about cleaning it, keeping it clean. I've never had anything quite this fancy, so I don't want to mess it up. Very common question we get. I have a jewelry care kit that we sell. Would you be interested in one of these? Yes, that'd be perfect. I bake a lot, and I just... You know, I don't want, I don't want to ruin it. - I knew you'd say yes. - What do you mean? - I never forget a ring I sell. - You sold the ring? He made the right choice. And it was a tough one. It was? People around here say I have a sixth sense. - About couples. - Oh, okay. Anyway, seeing him, I knew right then, that was the one. - You did? - Congratulations again. To all three of you. To all three of us? Well, your fiancé's daughter. She's quite a spitfire. - Oh, no, he doesn't have a... - What was her name? I can almost think it's like a flower... Daisy. Daisy. Yeah, Daisy's the one who picked that ring. We looked at the cushion cut, the princess cut, - but that was the one for you. - Um... Whoa. What about your care kit? - Gary. - T. What did you do? Uh, wh-what do you mean? Uh, I mean she's on her third batch of rye. Well, it is a bread store. We don't need that much rye. That's her thinking bread. What did you do? I didn't do anything. - Today. - Oh. Yeah. Gary, get your ass in that kitchen and fix this, okay? Hey, Rach. You got a little, uh... schmutz... Sorry. Look, I'm really sorry about the other night. A client came in late. And, I mean, you know how it is. I don't like to say no to the walk-ins. Part of that is because of you. 'Cause of the New York Magazine article. Because you're the best. How did you get the ring, Gary? What? It's... so extravagant, it's so beautiful, you know, I can't help but wonder, how did you manage that? I mean, you did buy it, right? Gary? You know. Yeah, I know. How? That doesn't matter, Gary. Look, Rachel, I messed up. Yes, you messed up. But also... Also, what? It's like when I wake up in the middle of the night with some crazy idea for a tattoo. Once I sketch it, it becomes obvious. When I saw you open that ring box, it was the most obvious thing I'd ever seen. What was your plan, though? What, were you gonna wait until we were in a nursing home to tell me this story? What were you thinking? You gave me somebody else's engagement ring. - That's crazy. - I know. I know. It's crazy. I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened, Rachel. I didn't have a plan. And then I saw that ring on your finger, and I realized this is the thing I want the most in the entire world. How could I give that back? What if there was no ring? What do you mean? I'm giving it back. So I'm asking you right now, not half-concussed, no ring you have to hide behind, like... do you still want to marry me? Yes. Of course I want to marry you. I see a future with us. If you just give me one more chance, I will be so much better. I promise you. As a matter of fact, I think we should celebrate the shit out of it. Let's have an engagement party. I mean, really. We should have this huge New Year's party here. My cousin Finn will be in town, and we can invite everybody that loves us. Because I love you, Rachel. Remember to let me do all the talking. Why can't you just ask for the ring back? It's complicated, honey. Sometimes, when there's a mix-up, you got to be careful of people's feelings. What about your feelings? East River. I feel like I should be more surprised to see you. Hi, Terri. This is my daughter Daisy. Hi. Uh, my dad's gonna do all the talking. Don't worry, kid. I don't know social cues yet either. You here to see Rachel? Again? Yeah, she-she texted me and told me to come by. Oh, yeah, she's in the back. Dad, can I go say hi? Yeah, go ahead. She's right around the corner. So, um... do you have something you want to tell me? Or...? You know? I know that something feels off, and I have a feeling that you have something to do with it, so... I want to know what's going on. For Rachel. - Hi, Rachel. - Hi, Daisy. - Hi. - Is your dad out front? - Yep. - Your dad's here? Are you making bread? Can I help? Of course you... abs... I need help. That'd be great. Um, do you want to grab an apron? - Yeah. - Right there. - Can I talk to you for one sec over here? - Yeah. What do you want me to do? Want me to talk to him? - I'll handle it. - Really? Oh, my God, thank you so much. - You're the best. - Right. Well, I'll meet you at the apartment later tonight. Maybe we can go over ideas for New Year's Eve. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I love you so much. - Okay. I promise I won't mess this up. Okay. Bye. I'm gonna sneak out back. All right. What? He got my ring, I got his present. Wow. That is way worse than I thought. And I-I tried to tell her the other night, but I couldn't. I just... I didn't want to break her heart. All right. Perfect. You can get your hands in there. Make a little mess. Yours is way better than mine, PS. So, how long does this take? Takes a while. Oh. What do you do while waiting for it to be done? I don't know. That's a good question. What do I do while I wait... I do a lot of thinking while I wait for my bread to bake. Well, I also spend a lot of time thinking. You know, when I was about your age, I lost my mom, too. Do you like thinking about your mom, or does it make you... make you kind of sad? - A little of both. - Me, too. Can I teach you a little trick that's helped me? - Okay. - Okay, so you find one thing that you did with your mom that was really special, and you make sure to do that thing once every year. And at least for me, it feels like she's right there with me. Mm. Do you have anything like that? Well, every year, on Christmas Eve, the three of us would pick out these really ugly sweaters for each other. I mean, they were always so funny. But... we... haven't done it since she's been gone. Uh, yeah. You can't stop doing it 'cause she's not here, though. You got to keep the tradition alive because of her. - Right? - Right. Your mom sounds like she was pretty cool. She was. Hey. Thank you so much for coming. Oh, yeah. What, uh, what are y'all up to here? My God, it looks like I'm in heaven. Well, I'm helping make it. Yeah? You ask for a paycheck? Oops. I forgot. Sorry. Can I talk to Rachel for a little bit? Yeah. I'll invoice you, Rachel. I will just cut right to the chase. I know about everything. And I know it's insane. All of it is insane. I just wanted to say I am so sorry. No, I am. I-I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't. I just didn't think it was my place to say anything. Thank you for being exactly who you are through all of this. You're a really, really good person. I appreciate that. I just wanted to apologize myself. Gary's gonna reach out to you, obviously, give the ring back, and, um... ...then we can all just move on. I, uh... I made this one special for you all to share together. Thank you for this. Yeah. Okay. Well... I guess this is it. ♪ ♪ Bye. ♪ ♪ Hey. Hey, Rach. Can you have a seat for me real quick? - Uh, yeah. - Um... I, uh, I got to talk to you about a situation with you and Gary. But before I do, just know that I am getting my ducks in a row to absolutely kick his ass... - I know, Terri. - You know? - What do you know? - I know all of it. It's done, and I... I just, I don't really... I don't want to talk about it right now. But wait. Rachel, uh-uh. Hold up. We gonna talk about it. Are you and Gary still...? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Yes. - Yes? - Yeah. Yes. Okay. Wow. Okay. Computer is processing. Terri, not every relationship is that simple. Okay? Right? Like, what about you and Sophia? When you met her, she was seeing somebody else. - That's not exactly a perf... - That... No one's perfect. Hell, I used to have an eyebrow ring. Nobody's talking about that. Always bringing up old stuff. What about Ethan? Look, I know something when I see something, and that wasn't nothing. He just wanted his ring back. That's it. I deleted his number. It was nothing. Look. Hey. Gary's not perfect either. I know that, but you don't turn your back on somebody because they don't know how to tell you that a ring they could never afford just ended up in their lap. He has some work to do. Who doesn't? I think you got to hold on to the good. And I think you got to love people when you can, because there is no guarantee that they'll be here tomorrow. You know? Well... does that mean that I have to start being nice to him or...? Terri, I think people would be very confused if you did. I would be very confused if I did. Oh, hold up. Wait. What did you do with the ring? So, there I was, stranded in Brooklyn, on a Zoom, trying to get a Lyft, but it was impossible because it was rush hour. It was just horrible. Well, lucky for you, all the subways will have Wi-Fi by the end of the year. There was a sign. I was bored on the subway. Where'd you go again? Uh, j... um... Dad? Where did we go? Hmm? Uh... we-we had... we went to the bakery. - Remember? - Yeah. Uh, and I got to help make the bread. Well, n-not this one, but still, can we try it? Sure. Yeah. Oh. Sorry. Oh, there's a warm piece. - That smells amazing. Okay. - Make sure it's not poisoned. - My turn. Whoa. - Wait, I wasn't done. - You got your piece. Come on. - I was... I wasn't, I wasn't done. I... Vanessa... ...will you marry me? Yes. Yes! Oh, my gosh. This is why you've been acting so weird. We'll have to get it sized when we go back to L.A. This will never fit, but... What a unique way to propose. - Uh... - It-It's so original. Okay, now we're gonna have so many things to do when we go back to L.A. You know, we'll have to look at venues. I'll make a list. Okay. I-I'm-I'm gonna call a couple people. Okay? - I love you. - I love you. What about moving back? Did you even talk about that yet? We... Let's just focus on everybody being happy right now.
