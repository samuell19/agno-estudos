I don't know how I got here and who put me here. I just know that there were so many of us who called each other family. So many that I couldn't even remember all their names. There is a new one joining every few days. When there was someone new, he would cry day after day. He cried so much that we couldn't sleep. Some even cried for a whole week, and then gradually, the cries lessened. He just sat quietly and stared at nothing. Maybe he knew that crying himself to sleep wouldn't make his parents come back for him. When I first got there, I was the same. But we all would get used to it as time passed. Because we knew we were in the same situation. I have been blind for as long as I can remember. This guy, Tam, was born deaf and mute. He's a gentle guy. Despite whoever says anything, he just smiles. There is another one sitting over there. Over there! He's paralyzed. He hates his parents for leaving him when he was a child. So he never wants to join this program. He just comes here to support us. We're so lucky to have Mrs. Tu around. She's the most wonderful person that life has brought to us. Even though you're not perfect physically, your soul is. Whatever problems you face, you have to overcome them. Got it? Yes, ma'am. Mrs. Tu had gone too soon when we were only about 14 years old. We were adopted by a pagoda and an orphanage. But we didn't want to become anyone's burden, so we decided to live on our own. We have stuck with each other until now. Tam, what's your dream? My dream? To be a singer! He's such a crazy one. How about you? Me? I want to have a big house so we all can live together. That's good. Duc, what's your dream? My dream... ...is that our birth parents will watch this show and recognize us. I want a chance to meet my parents at least once. This show has helped many people find their families. I hope there will be a miracle for all of you. Let's go. Sadness doesn't just come and go in life We're just living by... The TV is broken, just like me. Rubbish. Maybe the cable is loose. Go and check. You go. - How can I go with such legs? - I can't either with such eyes. If I can walk and see... I actually can see... If I can walk like Tam, I would go already. As far as we know, we are apparently arguing while he's the one who can see and walk, but he doesn't take up the task, just simply sitting and eating. He's not happy doing this, right? He's proud of doing this. Why so long, though? Maybe there is a short circuit, and he's stuck. Nonsense. Rotate, rotate, and turn. To gain is to lose It's back on. Come back here. Nothing is perfect It's on, come. Light up the candle inside each of us Stop hiding in the shadow Where's the picture? - How do I know? - I could only hear the sound. - Tell him not to come down yet. - Nothing is perfect - You can't even talk. - Turn left. Don't come down yet, it's not finished. Tell him not to come down. - Stay there, it's not done yet. - Just believe and everything... What are you doing here? Get back there. It's because of him! - Go down when I tell you to. - Please believe in me Don't come... It's Tam who threw at you. So what now? Tell him to turn it. Turn it. Turn some more. Turn which way, though? Whatever, just turn. Left, right, it doesn't matter. Just turn. - Hey, it's on. - It's on. It's off again. - Stop. - Turn, to your left. More. More what? - What? - It's completely gone. I can't hear you due to the rain. Stop. Slowly. Just do it slowly. - To the right. - Keep turning. I said stop. Stop! I said "stop," not "to the right." - Stop. - You're an idiot. More to the right? Harder. Only turn the other way when I tell you. Listen to me only. Look at the screen and adjust. - Okay? - Wow. Just look and adjust. Not yet. It's on now. Okay, done. Let's watch it on YouTube tomorrow. So it's broken for real, just like me? To gain is to lose Nothing is perfect Light up the candle inside each of us Stop hiding in the shadow To gain is to lose Nothing is perfect Don't let the troubles beat us Just believe and everything will be fine Please believe in me Hi, everyone. How are you doing today? I'm at a very famous place right now. The Three Bananas' famous grilled dish. Wow, such a long queue. Please let me go through. I'm doing a livestream video. - Say hi. - Hi! It's so crowded. This is where you get your number. THONG KIEU: THE BANANAS ARE MORE DELICIOUS THAN YOU Two specials, please. - Welcome to Three Bananas. - This is Three Bananas shop. - And here is the first member. - Hello! Hi, this is our main guy. Everyone knows him. Can you say "Hi" to people? VU TRUNG HIEU: LET ME JOIN YOU GUYS, LOTTERY SALES SUCK. YEN NHI: LOVE YOU, MY HOT BANANA. - I didn't know you would come here. - I'm here to see the owners. And you? I'm a regular customer here. Hi, I'm John, editor of the channel you guys just filmed with. This is Christie, an intern. - Welcome to Three Bananas. - We met her already. She's been pacing here for a while. We are here to bring you a good news. We received a phone call right after the show was on air. - What's news? - Welcome to Three Bananas! Someone claimed to be Tam's birth mother. She lives in Gia Lai. What? Tam's mother? Yeah. Tam, good news for you. Your mom is looking for you. Welcome to Three Bananas. He's not there. He's at your two o'clock. Tam! Good news! Someone just claims to be your mom. Congrats! What is he saying? Someone claims to be your mother. My mom? Is my mom really looking for me? He asks if it's real. Are you telling the truth? Are you sure? All right. I finally found my mom! He found his mom. Today it's on the house! Everyone can eat for free! Let's close the shop and go! Can I go with you guys? No, the trip might be tough. Do you really want to go? Of course I do. I want to record how you guys find your families to make a documentary. If I can make a good one, they will take me in. Then let's go! I will find us a car. Tomorrow we will start early. You guys go ahead, I'll stay back. Why? If we all go, who will run this shop? Idiot, you have your whole life for that. Finding his mom is his forever dream. They will be very happy when reuniting. Really? Why did she leave him then? Stop it, man. No need to worry about me, I can go alone. Guys, I just came to tell you the news. Going or not is up to you. She's really sick. She had someone contact us on her behalf. She said, "It's my last wish to see Tam for once before I die." If you want to go, then don't waste time. - I'm leaving now. - Sure. Hey, handsome. - Wow. - Duc. - Can you share how you feel now? - Yeah? I feel cool. The air is so crisp up there. I meant to ask what you think. Oh, my thoughts? I wish the air is like this at home. We can save money on the air-con. What about Loc? I'm all right. Sometimes, I could smell cow poop from the road. Quit joking around. This video will be uploaded. It's good, man. You guys are so noisy that I can't sleep. Do you go this route often? No, I've just bought this car. Mr. Binh, do you have your license yet? Don't look down on me. I just got it yesterday. You just contacted me right after I got hold of my license. Don't you have anywhere else to go and try your driving? Why us? I only have two limbs left. Suddenly I feel so cold. Like a cold wind blowing from the north. So scared. The traffic's bad today. We can't go through. Hey, bro, what happened ahead? Landside from the heavy rain last night. No idea when they could clear it all up. - I will take this shortcut. - Thanks, bro. Hey, do you know any shortcuts to Ayun Pa, Gia Lai? - Yeah, follow me. - Thank you. Are you from a tribe? You can tell from his skin. Yeah, he's blue. He's not a parrot. Don't you fool me. If I lie to you, I will get shot. Damn, that was close. I was just kidding. Speak of the devil! Hey! Oh, my God. What a man with no honor. Hi, everyone. As you can see, things often happen on the road. - Luckily, this is just a minor problem. - Who told you so? It ain't a small problem. We would stay here forever if we didn't have a spare tire. So I can enjoy this beautiful view. What view? You might enjoy it, but we don't. Stay here as long as you want until you get attacked by wild animals. Don't mess with my head. - We're actually useful. - Yeah. - What's wrong with you? - See what he's trying to say? The tire! Why didn't you run after it? I would if you could hold the car for me! Shit, I'm screwed. Stop recording! Are you happy now? How can I pay the car owner? Damn. But you said you just bought the car. - Everyone is allowed to dream, right? - All right, don't be sad. When we get back to Saigon, we will gather some money for you. What matters now is how we can find a tire. Right. If we don't get going now, we might arrive at his mom's funeral. Watch your mouth. Hello? I have good news for you. What's that? Your video has gone viral. So many shares. Unbelievable. I just sent you more. That's my girl. Keep me updated on more videos. I know. Bye, honey. Hello. Is there a car workshop somewhere around here? Can you share the spare tire? Translate it. Our tire is broken. Can we borrow your spare tire? It's not that hard, you guys suck. Let me then. - Why does he put on the glasses? - It's called feng-shui. Hey, bro. Are you okay? What kind of feng-shui is this? This bull is so hot-tempered. Does it hurt? Let him kick you, and you will know. Man, I missed that part. Hey, go slap his butt, so she can record. You think you know better? - Let me. - You will slap his butt again? If you don't help us, we will die here. All right. - How does he understand? - Yeah, why? It's from heart to heart. This tire is much bigger than ours. The screws don't really fit. Is everything okay? I don't know yet. Why is there always bad news? I wish we had another car. Right, we'd leave the broken one here and use the other one. What a nice wish. No, what I meant was I could sit in the other car and record you guys. Whatever. That suits you well. So sleepy. Again? You have to make sure he doesn't fall asleep. What? What's that? Calm down, guys. It's you who need to calm down. Look to your right. It's so dark, I can't see. There's a snake. Keep quiet. If you move, it will bite our friend. On your right. It's a snake, not a cake. A snake. Why didn't you tell me earlier? - There's a snake. - What's wrong, kids? Calm down! Don't worry. I know how to deal with snakes. Let me record this. See? See how good I am? Hey, sit still. Sit still. Whistle with me, guys. Dodge! Get out! The tire! We can't lose the tire! Move to the right. Hi, everyone. Hey, look. What a pretty girl! Stop watching porn while we're on a business trip. There's a snake! We're about to hit the main road and might meet some unexpected guests. You scare me, man. It's only my first time. What's wrong? Someone is following us. - What do you see? - Damn, they have guns! - Keep driving! - Stop! - Stop! - Stop! - Enough shouting, where is the snake? - I don't know. Faster! Hurry up! They're getting close! Hey! Guys! Find a way to cut them off. Why do they keep driving away? One, two, three. What's with the rush? All right, focus, everyone. Smile. One, two, three. Again? Are you crazy? Why go this way? Well, I thought I could avoid them. - They're here. Think my ass. - Let me think. - They're right behind us. - Let me think. Got it. Get off and help push the car. They've turned the other way. Hurry up. We've got a flat tire again. See, I told you they had guns. Glad we ran, or we'd all be dead. What the heck? Why did they all run away from us? There is nothing in the car. Poor him. The snake doesn't do anything. He's so gentle and civilized. Give him a like! Give him a like. I told you, you're responsible for whatever happens. Don't worry. You got in the car already. They probably have stolen this car. Why else did they run when we approached? Gosh! It's not that simple. What if the police pull me over? He's right. Shut up. We just simply borrowed this car. We will return it to the police after we're done. That's it. Yeah. Did you record everything? Yeah, I did record it. We have all the proof. You have nothing to worry about. What about my car, then? Don't worry. We will pay for your car later. What matters now is we have to hurry up, or else Tam's mom might be gone. - Rubbish. - I knew it. Light up the candle inside each of us Stop hiding in the shadow To gain is to lose Nothing is perfect Don't let the troubles beat us Just believe and everything will be fine Please believe in me Hi, everyone. - Hi! - Hi! - That's my idol. - We're ready to go. - This is Mr. Binh. - Hello, everyone. He will take us to Gia Lai in this car. God is fair. Can I take this road to Ayun Pa, Gia Lai? Only locals can go by this road. - Can you show me the way? - No. - Are you a local? - Yes. Thank you. Watch out for the floods. Oh, God. It's a dead-end, but that guy said we could go this way. He meant to say that we could go on foot. Things are getting interesting. Why are you so happy when there is a problem? Which side are you on? So what's now? There have been bad signs. Bad signs? Let's go back then. It's still far, there's not much time. How about we walk on foot? Walk from here? Are you nuts? Tam is right. We don't have time. - His mom is... - Is what? Screw you! I haven't finished yet! What I meant was walking there is faster than going by car. What do you think? - I like it. - Then let's do it. All right, let's meet up at his mom's house. How can you keep up with them? What? Excuse me, is that how we get to the other side? Yeah, we all use this rope to cross. The government will fix the bridge soon. - Is there any other way? - This is the only way. I'm not going. I'm afraid of the height. Tam! What's happening in front of me? Our friend wants to become Tarzan. - How high? How far? - Just like those videos on YouTube. You're likely to fall while on it. He will be gone before his mom. Rubbish. Has he reached the other side? He's safe. My turn. No way! If you go first, who will help me up? What about my wheelchair? If you go first, who will help me attach the rope? Besides, Christie's here to help you. Don't worry. No! I'm not going last! What if something happens to me? Why do you fight with the girl now? Hurry! It's okay. - Bye. - Tam, Christie is crossing. - I got it. - He got it. - Go! - Pull! - Okay. - Yeah. - Help me! - Tam, I think it's stuck! Pull back! Be careful! Help me! - So heavy. - Help me! Tell Tam not to pull! Tam! Please pull me in! Look at me! Stop pulling! Got it. Stop pulling! Shut up! Leave it to me! Tam! Listen to me only! Throw the rope, don't pull! Okay? Good. You suck so badly. Now, pull. Where is the rope? It's dropped. Gosh! You can't do shit! What rope do I pull now? Help me, guys! Hold on! We're working on it! - Hurry up. - Hold on. What the hell? Whenever there is a problem, anti-fear glasses will help. Hurry up and help me! Now I understand the old saying, "Hard times create strong men." Christie, don't be afraid! I will take care of this! I'm coming, Christie! Christie, I'm here. Don't worry, I'm here. Where is the hook? Duc, what are you doing? What are you doing? Stop confusing me. Show me where the hook is. - Stop confusing me! - Up here! Help me! I'm coming! Show me the hook so I can help you. I'm coming! Another guy? What's wrong with you, Duc? How can I still get hit by tires while in the air? I'm sorry, the brake doesn't work up here. Calm down. It looks like the wheel has gone sidetracked. If you move, it will break. - Don't move. - Don't. Who the hell is playing at this moment? Our friend is climbing here. We already have two useless guys here, why need one more? Go back! He's going faster. This guy likes to rebel. Telling him to go back, he will do the opposite. Hey, buddy, come here with us! Come play with us, my friend! - Come here. - Everything is shaking hard. He's here already. I never thought at this moment he would want to... Let's just keep it together. Hold on to the rope. Help me! Where are we going? Hold me tight. I can't see. - Hold me. - Help me. That's right! Pull harder! I can't make it. Are you all right? I'm good. What about them? Are you okay? Everyone is fine. Thank you so much. You guys almost died because of me. You're so brave. Check your backpack. Luckily, it's waterproof. Everything is safe. We don't have time, we need to hurry. What's he saying? We lost all our belongings and my wheelchair. How can I continue? We will take turns to piggyback you. I'll go first and Tam's next. Don't worry! I will carry you. I will stay here. You guys can go ahead. What's wrong? We made it here, and now you don't want to go anymore. Why? I don't want to become a burden. Stop saying that. We're brothers. Nobody is anybody's burden. We help each other out, got it? I understand! I know, but how far can you guys carry me? You will eventually leave me like my mom did! You are giving up too early. Are you afraid? I'm not afraid. But what we are doing is nonsense. We are risking our lives for someone who abandoned us! If they truly loved us, they wouldn't have left us! - Do you understand? - I know how you feel. But Tam and I are no different. You know that although he can't speak, he understands everything, right? Have you already forgotten what Mrs. Tu said? Whenever you have your chance, you must go find your family. Because family is the peace you always come back to. I beg you. Please give Tam one chance. And allow those who abandoned us to make up for their faults. This is the biggest opportunity in his life. Do you want to upset him? I will never forgive them even if you kill me. Tam. No need to shout, he can't hear. I'm fine, you stay here then. Excuse me, boy. Where can I buy some drinks around here? I'm so thirsty. Nope, but we have drinks at home. Follow me. Thank you very much. - Dad, we have a guest. - Yeah? - Hello. - Hi. I'm on a long journey and got so thirsty. Could I have some water, please? - We have plenty of water. - Yes. - Drink some tea, then I'll get some water. - Thank you. - Hey, don't break the car. - Yes. Come in. - Nice car. - Yes. - You just bought the car? - No, I borrowed it. If it's our own car, we would be more comfortable. - Right. - If we borrow it, we'll have to take good care of it, just like our wives. Well... If it's scratched, they will charge more. It's okay. I borrowed it from my best friend. - That's good. Drink your tea. - Thank you. Vang, stop kicking the car. Shouting makes my throat so sore. They're just kids. I told you to stop throwing rocks at the car. You're gonna break it by jumping up and down like that. There was one car that came here before. They also broke it badly. Luckily, they didn't ask for compensation. We wouldn't know where to get the money. I think I know that sound. These kids love to deflate the tires. - It's because there is air in the tire. - He's here, run! What the hell? How? I told you these kids love breaking stuff. This isn't something you can play with. Go away. Where is the nearest police station? It's far from here, all the way down this road. Thank you. Thank you for not making them pay. - Hey, what kind of medicine is this? - Ecstasy. I thought it was aspirin. I took three pills already. Tam! I know you're in a hurry. Oh, no. My leg hurts. I want this road to lengthen. What? You heard what I said? What are you saying? Never mind, he'll be so tired then. How are they doing now? - Score! - Yes, right foot. Watch out. Good. Now turn right. Right. You're such a strong man for carrying me the whole time. This isn't my first time. Run faster! - Faster! Straight ahead! Turn right! - Stop! This way. Here. Hurry. - Here, hurry up! Turn left! Quick! - Get him! Security! Run! Run! That was long gone. What's your dream now? - I don't want any fancy dreams. - On your left. Left. I just want to switch places with you right now. It's hard not being able to walk. But in this case, I'd prefer that. There is someone over there. Let's go ask them. - Excuse me. - Yes? Bro, it's those guys. Oh, shit. Run. Where is my car? Who are they? It's their car that we borrowed. Why are they so hostile now? Where's my car? It's across the river. The driver's staying with it. How do I contact him? Only Christie has his number. Take me there, then. Don't speak a word, or I'll cut your tongue. Can I ask you one last question? How many people are there in your group? Why ask? Everything happens for a reason. I'm so tired. - Can you guys help me carry my friend? - No way. You carry him yourself. Jesus, I'm so exhausted. Just keep trying. People will look at this and judge them. They will say that even the disabled is better than them. They don't deserve to live. That's an understatement. I presumed their parents will be cursed for not guiding them to lead a good life. Why would they give birth to such a bunch of dummies? - Yeah. - There's more. Their pictures will be posted on Facebook so everyone will cyber-attack them. Their parents will be too ashamed to live. - So embarrassed. - Yeah. Can you shut up? I'm not saying bad things about you. That's right. One more word and your tongue is gone. Wow, cut off our tongues. Like real gangsters. - They're like kidnappers. - They'll turn us into beggars. - Hung. - Yes. They're giving me a headache. Carry the guy. Our heights aren't even. Thank you, big brother. Thanks buddy. Why are you shaking? So nobody carries me, nobody shows me the way? Stop acting like an idiot. I'm not hurt anymore. We've got the package. What about these guys? Can we let them go? We're just transporters. Don't get involved in murders. But what if we let them go and something happens? They might call the police and we'll be dead. Kill the cripple. The blind one can't see our faces. Now I realize the advantage of being blind. If I die, I will take him with me. - Right! - You're next. Should we bury them alive? You're dead meat. These thugs howl like dogs. Stupid thugs, how can we die being buried like this? More like a mud-bath. Enjoy it. - Sometimes we don't do anything... - Such shallow thoughts. If life is that easy, pain wouldn't even exist. Imagine this. That won't work. If we bury them alive, they will stink in a few days, the police will find out about us. Then take the cripple's eyes out. - You think he would shut up? - We have to clean up everything. Kill them all. Where are they? Find them! Over there. - Nothing. - There he is. Run after him. Stop! Why did you make me run into the river? It's so rough here. This terrain will slow them down. I'm the one running, why are you out of breath? - Stop! - I feel tired for you. Hurry! Run. They're down there. - Where are they? Find them! - Let's split up and find them. Do we lose them yet? Where is he now? Just hide under this tree. Why do I suddenly feel so warm and strange here? - Move! Move! - Behind! Run. Jump. Be careful. On your right. Turn left. So confusing. A log. Jump. Jump. - Where else am I supposed to run? - Go straight. Watch out. - Hung. - Yeah? - What's wrong with you? - Fear of height. How can you get up there? - I fear the elephant more. - Get down! Guys, stop. What? - Hey... - What? Oh shit! Don't move, or you will be stung. Just a moment. Stay there, I will go down and catch you. What now? I will count to three and we run. - One. - Chase them. I'm so dead. Anyone helps me? - Why so many? - Hung! Hung! Hey, there is a puddle. Hey, there is a puddle. - Hurry up. - Can we take a break? I can't breathe. Keep on running. They're right behind us. Stop! Did you really know where to go? It's your fault. I said stop but your feet were quicker than your brain. Help me. I don't like this dangerous adventure. - Where are you, Loc? - I'm over here. It's quite safe. How about me? Am I safe? Not a bit. Damn you! Loc, where are you? Are you okay? Are you alive? Loc! Are you okay? I can't see anything. Really? God! So we're both blind now. How can we find the way out? What now? Crazy bastard. I only got mud in my eyes. I'm not blind. Is there anybody? Where are you guys? Help me. Boss, hold tight. Follow me. Hi everyone. This is Mr. Binh. Hi everyone. Do you have more clips of these disabled guys? I think we have around 10 more. We want to buy them all for exclusive use on YouTube. What do you think? Depends on how much you can pay. Fifty million. You surely know investing in a decent clip could cost hundreds of millions. Not to mention this one is already so viral. I think we haven't understood each other. Thank you anyway. I know you're tired, but you need to cheer up. Smile. See, this is much better. There they are. Guys, we're over here. Run! They will kill us. We always get bad luck but he doesn't. Run. Right. Turn right. Hurry up. Faster! Are you all right? Help him get up. Run faster. Down the hill, turn right. Who are they? Who are they? Owners of the car that we borrowed. If they catch us, they will kill us. - Run. - Don't look, just run. - Oh shit. Save her! - Where should I run? Jump! - Run! - Water again? I don't know how to swim. I don't know how to swim. - There! They're running away! - Hurry! After them! - I don't know how to swim. Help me. - Guys! Look out! - I don't know how to swim. - Move aside. I don't know how to swim. Save me! Where is Loc? Go save him. Hurry! Hurry! - On your right. Splash them. - What's that? What's in front of me? There's a big timber over there. - Oh my god! - Why is everyone shouting? What a big log. Run! Run! Is there anybody here? Help me. We're so lucky to have found this house. It sticks like dead mouse here. What? It's my feet. Why do they smell when you rarely use them? Are you not gonna use this pair of socks? Yes, I am. I have to dry them by the fire. They're burnt already. Why didn't you tell me? What're you laughing at? You should take off your clothes to not get sick. Well... Tam told you to take off your clothes or you would get sick. What are you afraid of? We're all good guys. Take off your clothes. We will turn around. You're safe with me. I will help you change. What are you looking at? I'm trying not to turn my head. So nice. I mean it's so nice of me doing this. You don't have to test. I can feel the air moving. It's your shirt, right? But you say you're blind. I'm guessing. Even though you can't see, I still feel anxious. Turn around. What's with all the whispering in there? I haven't turned around. Good boys! - Loc! - Yeah? Please watch out. Don't let it burn like the last time. It's burnt. Liar! You scared me! You're full with just by smelling? Hey guys, how did you learn to make delicious grilled banana? Back when we were on the street selling lottery tickets. We met two strangers who won the jackpot. They came back with a reward for us. They sympathized with us, so they taught us how to make the dish. So we could make a stable income. They learnt this from a person they met selling it on the highway. This smells so good. Is it easy to make? Yeah, it's not that hard. Just follow the steps. I will show you. Thanks to this, we were able to make a living 'til now. Why don't you record this? This is interesting. If you can catch this moment, they will hire you immediately. - There's no need. - Try this. - Such a good smell. - Eat. Slowly. It's hot. My shoes are dry now. - Go dry her shirt. - Who are you talking to? I'm blind. - Why are you sitting there? - Hello. I've been trying to reach you. You haven't sent me any videos. I'm still waiting. Send me now. I don't have any. Why? What have you been doing? You just care about the videos, don't you? Because everyone keeps asking about them so I have to call you. Is there something wrong? You haven't asked how I am doing. The videos are all you care. Do you know what we almost died just because of your greed? What are you talking, Christie? I quit. Come and finish the work yourself. Stop acting like that. We both agreed with this plan, didn't we? In order for our YouTube channel to compete with the others, we have to create the best videos. Something new and unique will attract more people. I think people pay a lot of attention to the three disabled's Three Banana Shop. Especially after they join our show to find their birth parents. If we manage to get some footage of when they find their families, we will get lots of views. Why don't we actively set it up for them? Christie, you will take care of this. Think about it as a free trip for them. You won't find any other business that can make huge money like this. Our YouTube channel will receive millions of views. What else do you want? I just want to go home. I feel so guilty. Are you aware that... we are taking advance of their trust and their own lives? I can't imagine what happens when they find out that everything is fake. I don't know how to explain to them. All right, calm down. If you both don't say a word, no one will know. You're the most disgusting person I've ever known. - I won't make the same mistake again. - Hello? Hey. You're hiding something from us, right? Tell us. I'm truly sorry. When we were drying your clothes, we found a picture of you and another man. Admit it. That's your boyfriend, right? Someone here will be sad. What's wrong? Sorry, our joke has gone too far. We just wanted to have some fun. I was kidding too. He's just a coworker. I didn't know he put it there. Coworker. You and I are both fooled. Over here. You must be very happy, Tam. Tam. It will be a long night tonight. You can't wait to see your mom tomorrow morning, right? You will just stand watch her from afar. Because you have never known who she is. Your mom will be crying a lot. She will run to you. "Tam, my son." "My son has grown up now." "You're just like your father... your hair..." "Gosh!" "How is your life?" "Do people laugh at you? Do they bully you?" "Tell me." "I'm so sorry." "I haven't been by your side. I'm sorry for leaving you." "I had no choice." "Please forgive me. Don't hate me, son." "Cheer up. We can be together from now on." "I will make up for you for all our lost time." Why are you crying? Don't cry. Be glad. You will see your mom tomorrow. You're happy now. I'm the one who is sad. I want to have a family like you do. Maybe I will never have any chance to feel what you feel now. Even if I met my mom now, I wouldn't be able to see her face. I'm blind. Cheer up. Tomorrow you'll see your mom. Cheer up! I wish I were you. Don't cry. You are beautiful when you smile. Guys! Wake up! Please wake up! Wake up! I am sorry. If I had not set up the story of finding his mom, this wouldn't have happened. I'm sorry. Did I mishear it or something? Let's go home. - Let's go. - Listen to me. You don't have a birth mom but you still have us. Thank God you guys are all right. Stay there. Listen to me, there is no one looking for you. She's been lying to us the whole time. No parents have looked for us. Understand? I'm sorry. I am sorry. Did you sleep well? Yes. Thank you for letting me stay here. No problem. Go brush your teeth and have breakfast. Yes. The water from the mountain is cold as hell. But it's interesting to bath like this once in a while. What are you two doing? Washing each other's hair. - Sounds so romantic. - Yeah. So warm, it's so warm. Why is there a woman's voice? So warm. Being hot and cold at the same time can lead to a stroke. Hurry up. Finish your bath and get ready for the meal. It's normal. That's how people bath here. Hello? - Hello? Who is this? - Hello! Mr. Binh? - What? - This is Christie. - What? - Why is it so noisy? Where are you? Can you come pick us up? What happened to your phone? I couldn't reach you. Where are you? We're in Ayun Pa, Gia Lai. I'm near you guys. How about this... You send me the GPS of your location, I will come. - All right. - Why is my hair still sticky? Did you guys use shampoo? We almost finished the bottle. We used hot water too. We don't have guests so often. Please stay here a few more days. That's settled. Go borrow some eggs so I can make noodle for breakfast. - Yeah! - Yeah! Thank you! Hi. The uncle next door send me to borrow some eggs, he will give it back later. The uncle next door send me to borrow some eggs, he will give it back later. Got it, borrow a scissor, cut your long hair. Got it, bruised face, apply some palm. Just some palm is enough. Got it, stomachache, find some place, over there. Stop it, I'm tired, my head and hands are aching. Just come in the house and get whatever you need. Excuse me, miss, can you come here and help me? So you two know each other? Hey, don't go. Stay here, I will ask her to translate. You look like you are mad at each other. Handsome guy and pretty girl, well matched. He wants to borrow some eggs for the uncle next door. I got it. Eggs, right? Just go back. Let me go get some and bring to you. Handsome boy and pretty girl. Well matched. I will get some eggs now. Hi everyone. Did you guys have fun with all the adventures in the mountains? - Hi! - Yeah! Mad at each other, eh? I know everything already. She's been taken advantage too. Let's not talk about it now. I have something more important. When you see them, tell them I'm sorry. Read the comments below each clip and they will understand. Someone claimed to be his relative. I'm sorry for lying to them. They won't believe whatever I say now. I have to count on you now. Please help me make up for my mistakes. I don't know if I can be any help. But I will try. Thanks to Christie's videos, Tam's mom was able to find him. Christie. Thank you a lot. Is it real? If I lie, you can shoot me. Stop saying that, those unfortunate events always happen to me. Well then, if I lie, you don't have to pay for the lost tire. What about the rental fee? Of course, I make a living on that. Finally we can fulfill our last wish, which is coming back to right where we first met. And thanks for that time, we had our son. I wonder if that place has changed. It hasn't, for sure. I promise to walk with you to the end of the road, no matter what. - You have to keep your promise. - I will. That's all I need. Same here. If the boss spares us when we get back, we will do anything he wants. Same here. But if we die, we die together. It looks like our car. Oh hey, that's the same plate. Move! Move! They're ahead of us. Go faster. - What's that? - Everybody, down! Why do they lose their brakes all the time? It's so dangerous. I thought it only happened in the news. I feel like they hit us on purpose. Indeed. They want to ask for your help. Help them then. Not everyone can do this. Just help them. We will pay for the damage. They're dying. - Stand up and speak. - All of you, be quiet! Sit down. - What are you trying to do? - Nothing. You're such a coward. What are you doing, thugs? Hit me. Hit me. You have no shame hitting a girl. Crazy bitch. - All that you do is just messing around. - Don't think that you can do whatever you want because you're old. He likes to wreak havoc on us. Run! - The elders please sit down. - Elders, so what? Trong. Look out, uncle. - Be careful, guys. - Pull the window up. Don't put it down. That was scary. - I'm scared. - Calm down. We haven't done anything. You know, we have been saving money and living a humble life to buy the tickets for today's trip. If I can't get there today... You can't even handle it. It's a dead-end. I don't want to die. Calm down, guys. I expect them to hit the car window. Hey my idol, that's not cool. Why did you steal my car? They will now ask why we stopped. Why did you stop? You have to pay for what you've done to my car. They'll tell us to get out. Get out! There's more. They will say if we don't get out, they will kill us. If you don't get out, I will kill you. Maybe I should keep quiet. You should join Tam and shut up. - Get out. - Hurry up. Just get out. - You. - Take it easy. - Stand still. - Freeze. - Freeze. - Hands up! - You're arrested! - Freeze, everyone! - Hands up! - Freeze! We're saved. It's us, Trong. - Stop there, put your hands up. - Put your hands up. Thank you a lot, Mr. Binh. You came up with the plan so quickly. I haven't done anything. It's all thanks to you. So Mr. Binh is an undercover? Well, Binh has informed us. And we asked him to keep driving in this car to lure them out but... The suspect has changed direction. Let's change to plan B. But it was really dangerous. Under that circumstance, I had no other choice. Mr. Binh. - Your car is fixed. - Really? - Good as new. - We also give you a spare tire. Wow, thank you so much. - Mom, where are you? - I'm here. Where are you, mom? Mommy? -Mom -I'm here. Take this. Good boy, take your medicine. I will find you a doctor when we get to Saigon. - Yes. - Be nice. We've arrived in Saigon. We've arrived. - It's Saigon. - Mommy. Traffic is so bad. Mommy. Poor little kid. - How can someone abandon such a small kid? - Abandoned? Mommy. Don't cry, where are your parents? - Where are your parents? - I don't know. I will take you to go find your mom. Mommy, where are you? - Hello. - Hi. My name is Binh. - I'm Tham. It's me who called you. - All right. This place must be huge and fancy. - Yeah. - I can tell from your expression. Mom. - Hi. - Hi. This is Tam. You haven't changed a bit. You look just like your father. You have mistaken. Tam, your son, is in fact this guy. That's right. We're looking for Tam's mom, not Loc's. This guy is Tam. Brother in law, say hi to your mom. I'm not mistaken. Look at the mole on his chin. When you were born, your mom didn't have enough milk. That was when I gave birth to my daughter, this one's sister. So your mom has brought you over, to feed on my milk. When we put you two next to each other, she kept touching his mole. Thanks to Christie's videos, Loc's mom was able to find him. Don't tell Loc, he resents his mom. Just say that she is my mom. I'm sorry, my mom was dead a long time ago. Loc, I understand how you feel. I know so well about your mom and her circumstance back then. I sympathize with her a lot. Sympathize? Why do you sympathize with someone who abandoned her own child? Do you know that when I was abandoned, I cried a lot? For all those years, I always thought of the day she left me. Your mom cried even more. She didn't have any money. And you got a strange disease which made your legs shrink. It hurt you every night, and you kept crying for help. Your mom had to sell everything to bring you to Saigon to look for a cure. She lied to you. She took me to Saigon to leave me there. You guys can go down for toilets. Is there anyone out there? Did everyone get on? Let's go. Is there anyone out there? I'm stuck. Help me. - Who's that? - I'm stuck inside. Move aside. - Thank you. - This door's always stuck. - Where is car that has parked here? - It went that way. Your mom has been trying to find you everywhere. Your dad was so sad, he got sick and then passed away. Your mom has never given up hope. She kept coming back here, selling whatever she has left, even sold the house to me, then she went to find you again. Until she had nowhere left to find you, she came back to where she lost you. And she sold grilled banana for a living, with a hope that someday you would find your way back there. Your mom even told me that if you came after she died, I should let you know this. Losing you is your mom's biggest loss. She would want you to accept her apology for hurting you. Loc. Is that you? Oh my god! Please forgive me. I didn't leave you, Loc. Forgive me, please. This house belongs to you now. You don't need to pay me anything. I still have lots of land. Thank you. Don't say that. We have known each other for years. You guys go ahead and eat. - Yes. - You, too. Yes, you. I want to give thanks to Mrs. Hai, to Mr. Binh, to everyone, to you, for helping me find my mom. And especially Christie. Thanks to your videos, I could find my mom. I'm afraid that you're still mad at me. Of course not, we don't know how to thank you enough. We would rest in peace if it's not for you. What do you mean? Remember the flood at the deserted house? When you walked away, Tam realized it and forced us to go look for you. We couldn't get any rest. Stop with the past. Let's eat. Christie, try this strawberry jam with bread. Thank you. How can you do it while you're blind? Blurred vision. Really? So the day when I was changing, you could still see? Blurred vision, yeah. - He's just joking. - I couldn't see anything. He can't see. Don't worry. Why did you give me unpeeled orange? - Wait, so I got it right? - Thank you! I was just guessing, I can't see anything. Help me peel it. I might cut myself. This guy is crazy, mom. As if you're not. - That's right! - What's up? Oh, your glasses are without lenses. I know. I just want to have some fun. You've just been fooled. - No way. - Eat up. Hey, eat this and talk less. - Keep your mouth less active. - It's you guys who've been talking. Let's drink then. You haven't given it to me. - He can see. - Wanna fool me again? Just eat, guys. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING THE MOVIE
