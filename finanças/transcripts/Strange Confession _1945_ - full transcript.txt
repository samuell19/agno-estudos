This is the inner sanctum. A strange, fantastic world. Controlled by a mass of living, pulsating flesh... The mind it destroys, distorts, creates monsters commits murder. Yes, even you, without knowing, can commit murder. - Yes. - I wanna see Mr. Brandon. Sorry, Mr. Brandon's in bed. It's very late. I know. I gotta see him. Now, just a minute. I don't know who you are. Tell him Jeffrey Carter's here. Just a minute, Frederick. It's all right, Frederick. It's rather late. I know but I've got to talk to you. I've got to. I don't think I know you, do I? You did. We went to school together. L... I'm Jeffrey Carter. Jeffrey Carter... oh, yes, yes, I remember. How are you? You used to help me when we were in school. You've got to listen to me. Are you in trouble? Oh, I have no right coming to you like this. You're an important attorney now and I'm. Well, I'm just nothing. I remember you were studying chemistry in college. You had a brilliant mind that's what you said, I brilliant mind. Well, you'll see how brilliant when I tell you. You've got to listen to me. We'll go into my study. Strange things can happen to the brilliant mind, can't they? Yeah. You oughta know. In the courts, in the prisons. Everywhere. The strange things that go on in the mind. Particularly the brilliant mind. Make yourself at home, Jeff. You better call the police. I'm afraid he's unbalanced. Yes sit down, Jeff. I suppose you think I'm acting strange. You're obviously in trouble. First, let me tell you, if you've come to me for legal aid, I'm going to have to disappoint you: I'm up to my neck in work now. If you'll only listen to me. You've never heard anything like I have to tell you. If you'll just listen... "Til I'm through. Will you promise to do that? Very well, let me remind you again, I'm too busy to take on any... I know you're one of the biggest attorneys in town. You only handle important cases. But ll let me show you. Eh, Brandon? I ook. You promised to hear me through. You promised. All right, Carter. I'll listen I can remember every detail of it. You see I have a brilliant mind you told me so yourself, Brandon. My whole life was wrapped up in chemistry. Not for glory... no. I wanted to work for mankind that's the kind of a fool I was. That was my philosophy. I wanted to help suffering humanity. That's all I wanted not money... not glory... Just to help. I understand. Go on. It all started several years ago. I was on my way home from the laboratory. From a day's work. It was Christmas Eve and the only problem on my mind was how to balance a Christmas tree on one arm, some packages on the other while digging into my coat pocket for a dime. - Merry Christmas. - Same to you. I liked my neighbors and they seemed to like me. Fven the kids. My packages were just dime-store knickknacks, nothing like the things I wanted to give, but it was all I could afford. - Mr. Carter. - Same to you. I didn't make much money. Didn't live in a high-class neighborhood. - Merry Christmas, Jeff. - Same to you, Jack. Oh, Jeff. You startled me. How are you, darling? I think I should tie a bell around your neck so that I know when you're home. Say, smells good. Oh, we're splurging for Christmas. Lamb chops. - What, no Turkey? - Not at these prices. Well, I don't care. Everyone else has Turkey on Christmas. We have lamb chops. So, you see, that makes us different. Yes, I do see, darling, but every now and then I'd like to be just plebeian and eat Turkey. Yeah, I know what you mean. Sometimes I think you married the wrong guy. You know, I never will be a businessman. That's no secret, darling. That's how your boss, Mr. Graham, gets rich on your ideas. Yes, and you have to pay the price, Mary. Well, sweetheart, I'm sorry. I just forget what kind of a person you are. All the money and the glory that he gets through you doesn't mean a thing to you, does it? Well, the only important thing is... I know. Helping mankind. Dinner's just about ready. Say, is Tommy asleep? Oh, yes, Jeff, and please don't wake him up. I had an awful time getting him settled. Maybe just a peek. Oh, Jeff, he can't eat that stuff no, but he can look at it, can't he? After all, a kid's gotta have a stocking when he wakes up on Christmas morning. Then he oughta have a fireplace to hang it on. How's he gonna think Santa claus gets in? Well, that's easy. Through the window. No, no, no. You're not supposed to cry when Santa claus comes. All right, Santa claus. Talk yourself out of this one. You get him settled now. And hurry up. Dinner's ready. All right. Here. Here there, now don't tell your mother. Now, how in the world did you get him quiet so fast? Just told him to shut up and he did. Oh, hurry up and get washed. Everything's on. - Okay. Jeff. Come here and see what Santa claus has done. Say, that looks swell. Complete with ol' Nick himself. Jeff, I wish we could have... Why, Jeff... Where are you going, Jeffrey Carter? You don't mean to tell me you're going back to work tonight? Well, it isn't exactly work. [T's only for an hour or so. I don't care what you promised, darling. Your Mr. Graham can exploit your talents every day of the year. He can take your discoveries and get rich on them while we eat stew seven times a week, but tonight's different, darling. It's Christmas... oh, no you don't. Not if I have... Oh, so this is what's so important. "I find it difficult to express my heartfelt appreciation for the great honor you have done me I feel that I am merely a servant of the people and that it is my privilege and humble duty... To help suffering mankind. I am merely an instrument, chosen to extend this new discovery to a waiting world. Alleviation of human suffering has been the motivating force behind this work. If what I have accomplished is worthy of distinction in the circle of this learned society, then I am indeed humble in accepting the recognition accorded my effort." "I am indeed humble" oh what a nice boss we have. A kind, generous soul. He's not only kind enough to steal your ideas and take the glory, he's even willing to let you write his acceptance speech for him. Cut it out, will ya? And so at this time, I would like to pay tribute to the men and women in my laboratories who have helped me. I bet he stayed up all night figuring out that little bone he just threw to you. I don't care. I think you're crazy, Jeff. Why, with your brains, you oughta set up your own lab. Get some of the credit you deserve. Mmm after all, Graham does own the largest medical distributing company in the city. I think it's more important to get the stuff out than to worry about receiving the credit for it. Yeah, yeah, I know. Suffering humanity and all that stuff well, I still think you're a sucker. Well, it's all in the way you look at it. Yeah, maybe you're right. I suppose when you've made some other big discovery, like, uh, the cure for cancer, Graham will be big enough to let us come and see the award for that, too. Huh? - Jeff, the boss wants you. - All right. Here we go again. The big rush act. Well, for once, stand your ground, will ya? You know he can't do without you. Stevens, I thought you told me Carter was gonna have his formula finished two weeks ago. I thought he would, but you know Jeff Carter as well as I do. He's a little on the careful side. You can't rush him. Well... let me have him. You sent for me, Mr. Graham? Hello, Jeff. Cigarette? No, thanks. How's the experiment coming? Oh, I think I'm on the right track now. Of course it needs development, but I believe it has definite possibilities. Well, I'm sure it has, judging from what you told me some time ago. I sure hope it works. Always cautious, aren't you, Jeff? Well, knowing you as I do, I don't need any further proof. Now here's what we're gonna do. You turn your notes in to Stevens and we'll get this thing into production immediately. There never was a better time than right now to put that drug on the market. Oh, but we can't do that. You see, I have to be absolutely sure that we're right. Well, don't worry about it, Jeff. As soon as we get into the process of production I'll give you all the time you need to perfect it. But listen, Mr. gra... - Oh, let's not discuss it, Jeff. Turn in the notes and let's get this thing started. All of the notes are in my head. And they're gonna stay there until all of my experiments have been completed. - You're forgetting something, aren't you? - What? Well, I'm paying you to take orders from me. I'm not gonna let you force the medicine on the public that might prove useless. You mean you refuse after all that I've done for you? Or do you forget the awards that the chemical society has given you for the things that I have discovered? I'm surprised at you, Jeff. That doesn't sound like you at all. Well, I guess it doesn't, but well, you're not going into production on this until I know it'll do what it's supposed to do. Do you think I pay you to fool around with test tubes month after month and when I get ready to put something on the market have you tell me that you aren't sure? But these things can't be done in a day. Sometimes it takes a lifetime. Well, I have no intention of giving you a lifetime to develop anything. I'm interested in the medical market today. And that has to be clearly understood between us as long as you're working for me. I'm sorry, Mr. Graham. I was working for you. You have my resignation. Well, that's gratitude for you. He'll be a hard man to replace. Oh, he'll be back. I'll blacklist him in every lab in the city. He won't get a job anywhere. - Oh, hello, Mr. Carter. - Hello, Mrs. Todd. I knew you'd be in today, so I have it all wrapped and ready for you. - Oh, thank you. - You know, that's the 158th box of candy you've bought from me. - Really? Yes. Two a week ever since I've been here. And it hasn't hurt your figure a bit. Oh, Mr. Carter, you say the cutest things. How much is it? Oh, still a dollar. There ya are. Well, Jeff... I let you go home early. It's new year's fve are you sure you won't need me tonight? Oh, don't worry about me. The only thing they'll be buying is headache powders and aspirins for tomorrow morning. Have a good time, you and the missus. You worked pretty hard this year. Oh, oh, Mr. Moore. My wife and I were wondering if my work... Listen, don't worry. As long as I'm here, you'll have a job. You are the best pharmacist I've ever had. You're almost better than I am. Now, I appreciate your work. Really. That is... here, this is for you and the missus. And these here are for little Tommy. - Oh, thank you. - Have a good time, my boy. We'll enjoy these. - Hi. - Daddy! - Oh, hiya, sprout. How you doing? - Fine that's good, where's your mommy? - In the kitchen. - Oh. And where else would I be at dinnertime? Hey, I wanna get in on this. Oh, wait a minute! You're with her all day. Okay. Oh. Got a present from the boss for new year's fve oh, wonderful. Um, Jeff. How 'bout the raise? It was nice of the boss to give us that, wasn't it? Jeff, didn't you ask him about the raise? No, I forgot. Oh, well. Go wash your hands. Dinner's just about ready. Yeah. Daddy, what's a raise? That's something your father, apparently, isn't interested in. And stop eating that candy before dinner. Well, what is a raise? You'll have to ask your father. - Don't you know, daddy? - More money. You got more money? I wouldn't know what to do with it if I had it mommy says she would. Women are funny that way. Come on, Jeff. I'm all ready. Okay, I'll be right there. You didn't tell him what I did? No. But I think he'll find out soon enough. Who broke this test tube? I said, "who broke my test tube?" As though I didn't know. Okay, young feller. That's gonna come out of your allowance. At a nickel a week, you're losing money awfully fast, Tommy. Yeah, I gotta figure out how I can get a raise. Afraid your father won't be much help there. I always feel as if I've accomplished an impossible task when I've got him in bed. You can say that again. Now, that's that. Now we can celebrate. Happy? Very. Sounds like we have company. Hello, Mary. Hiya, Jeff. Say, in case you don't know it, this is new year's Eve, so we're inviting you downstairs for a party. - They're much too sober. - Who's sober? I feel so awful for anyone to be sober on new year's Eve. Come on, come on. We've even got the landlady higher than a kite. - Oh, no! - Oh, boy, is she flying. - Oh, that I want to see. - Well, come on. Well, somebody's gotta stay here with Tommy. - Why, can't he take care of himself? - I'm not so sure of it. But, dear, if you'd like to go... Oh, come on, Mary. - You sure you don't mind? - Why, of course not. Go have some fun. I'l be down a little later - well, promise. - Sure, I will. Okay. Excuse me. It was awfully stupid of me. Well, not on new year's Eve. That's one night you're permitted to fall all over the place. Oh. I'm... I'm terribly sorry. Well, you should be. Young man, if you can't hold your liquor, then just stop drinking. Oh, that's right. Tell me, do you know where Jeff Carter lives? - Oh, you mean Carter the chemist? - Yes he makes gin in the bathtub. All the way up and first door to the left. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. Oh, happy new year, too. Come in. Hello, Jeff. Who's there? Graham. I'm glad to see you, Jeff. It's been a long time. Yes, it has. What are you doing here? Oh, new year's. You know, new resolutions that should be made before the year ends. This where you work now? Yes, at nights. I have a job in a drugstore now. Oh, that's no place for you to be working. You saw to it that I wouldn't work anywhere else. I know. And I'm sorry. But I'm glad to see you're keeping up with your experiments. Well, yes... I work at it whenever I have the time. Sit down? - Thank you. - Glass of wine? - No, thanks. How are things with you? Frankly, not too good. There's no sense in beating around the bush, Jeff. I came to ask you to come back to work for me. Oh, you feel that I've been punished enough, huh? Oh, I don't blame you for being bitter. As a matter of fact, I... I admit that I didn't appreciate you when you were working for me. You know, Jeff, ever since you left, I've hired any number of chemists. Not one of them has produced anything worthwhile. Perhaps you didn't give them enough time? Hello, beautiful. Now, relax, sweetheart, it's new year's fve. Now wait a minute. Hey, come back here. I told you that stuff would throw you. I wish you'd reconsider. I'd make it very worth your while. There's one thing you've never quite understood, Mr. Graham. I guess that's because you're a manufacturer and I'm a chemist. Money isn't important. I make barely enough to get along, but my wife and I are happy and that's more than most people can say. Of course, I can understand that, Jeff. But for the life of me, I can't see why a man like yourself can't do just as good work with a few of the nice things in life instead of, well, this. Think what I can give you. All of the facilities at your disposal to carry out any experiment you wish with all the time you want. What have you got here: A few test tubes stuck up in a bathroom? Oh, I know that sounds wonderful for a biography of a great chemist 100 years after he's dead, but you ought to think of the present. I'm offering you your old job back at your terms. I'm sorry, I'd rather struggle along as I am, on my own. Oh, dear. How was the party? A little loud dear this is Mr. Graham. My wife. - How do you do, Mr. Graham. - Oh, your wife. Well, I'm delighted. I'm sorry I never had the pleasure of meeting you formally, that is, while Jeff was working for me. I assure you, it was my loss. I've heard a great deal about you, Mr. Graham. Oh, I'm afraid not much in my favor. I've been trying to get your husband to erase the past, but he's a very stubborn person, Mrs. Carter. Yes, I know. good night to both of you and happy new year. - Thanks. - Happy new year. Thank you. Looks like Graham isn't getting along so well since I left you should take that as a compliment. Yeah, I suppose so. But any time Graham gives out any compliments, there's something behind it. Oh, he just wants to use me again for his own profit. Why don't you use him this time? What do you mean? Look, darling. You're trying to develop one of the most important things of your life. You've been telling me for the last two years you'd give your right arm for a decent lab to work in instead of the corner of a bathroom. Well Graham's offering it to you and at your own terms. Yes, but you don't know him. No, but I think I know you. You're stubborn, Jeff. Sometimes you're too stubborn. Listen, honey, I want to ask you something. Haven't you been happy since we married? Oh, of course I have, darling. But I don't see why we have to spend the rest of our lives living in a cheap boardinghouse when you have a chance of doing something so much better. You want me to go to work for him again? Yes, I do. Why? Just so that we can have more money? Well, if you want to put it that way. After all, it's time you thought a little bit about Tommy and me. He deserves some of the opportunities the other children have. Instead, you're standing on your own pride. And here I thought you were with me. Oh, but I am, Jeff. I just don't want you to go on spending the rest of your life like a thwarted genius when a man like Graham offers you everything you need to work with oh, if it was anyone but Graham. Jeff, don't be such a fool. Take advantage of him this time. Then if things don't work out, you can always leave. I never knew you felt this way. Well, I do. And I don't see that it's so wrong of me to want some of the things that the other people have. Well, such as a decent place to live and nice clothes for a change. And not to have to worry about whether we can afford a couple of lamb chops, grade b. Oh, I know these things don't make any difference to you, Jeff, but they do to me. They do to any woman. And if you wanna call me selfish for feeling that way about things, well, then, I guess I am selfish. Jeff? Darling, I'm so sorry. No, that's what I should say to you. But I didn't mean to... - I know what you meant and you were right. You and Tommy certainly deserve more than I've given you. Happy new year, darling. It's going to be a new year. Well, and these two seem to be getting along all right. Yes, it's the other one I'm worried about. Well, that's not good. Well, stick to it, professor. Oh, gee, I better get going. I don't want to miss that date see you later, Jeff. And don't work too now, remember Graham won't pay you any overtime. - Hello, Dave. - Hello, Mr. Graham. - Well, how's it coming, Jeff? - Well, I don't know. A few days ago I injected these four rabbits with disease germs. Today, three are alive and well, the other dead. Well, sounds like you accomplished a great deal. Well... not with the dead one. Oh, I'm afraid if we tried perfection in everything, we'd have to wait a long time. Seems to me that a 75% average in a thing like this is pretty good. I don't know... I've been checking my notes. It's not good enough. We must have perfection. - Have you named the drug yet? - Zymurgine. - Sounds all right. - There's only one trouble. I haven't been able to lay my hands on a particular mold. This mold comes from certain plants in south America. Hmm. South America, hmm? Yes I've been burning a lot of midnight oil studying up on it. Well, tonight you're coming over to my house with your wife for dinner. Oh, that'll be fine. She'll like it. You know, she hasn't been out much lately since I've been working on this. Well, we'll try to show her some fun. - She deserves it. - Make it about seven. - Fine. We'll be there. - Good. Uh, miss Rogers. Have Stevens step into my office right away. Yes, thank you. See you later, Jeff. - Right. Mary! Mary! - What's going on here? Coming into the house blasting the place down and... and Mrs. Carter trying to put a child to bed. Well, I... I... I'm Mr. Carter. Oh, you are, are you? Well, I'm Mrs. o'Connor. And I'll thank you to not be making so much noise when you come trampin' in. Ho, ho, all right. Hello, darling. I was just putting Tommy to bed. - Say, who's that? - Why, that's Mrs. o'Connor. She answered our ad for a housekeeper. She's wonderful. She doesn't like noise. W... w... well, I... I guess a person has to kinda get used to things. Say, maybe she's got something there. - You mean we have. - Ah... ah... ah. Don't you sit down. We're going out tonight. We are? Where? Over to the boss's. He invited us to dinner - you mean Mr. Graham? - Uh-huh. Oh, darling. Things are looking up all over, aren't they? They sure... I don't know when I've enjoyed a dinner so much. Yes, it looked almost too good to eat. Thank you. Judging from the looks of Jeff, you must be an excellent cook youself, Mrs. Carter. - She is. - Oh, it isn't that. Jeff's so easy to please. Well, we'll have coffee in the drawing room. You have a lovely home, Mr. Graham. Yes, it's nice. Gets lonely at times. Beg pardon, sir. There's a telephone call for you. Oh, just make yourselves comfortable I'll be back in a moment. Do you mind pouring? - I'd love to. - Thank you. Excuse me. - Sure. - He's nice, isn't he? - Mmm-hmm. Hello yes, Stevens, I hear. I found the formula in the notes I'm copying them right now. It'll take at least a couple of hours. Well, that's all right. Take all the time you need. Be sure to copy everything carefully. All right. I'm so sorry. That was a long distance call. Thank you. Well, Jeff, I've good news for you. I saved it until after dinner. What's that? It's all arranged for you to go to south America. South america®? You mean you'd really send me down there? Of course, if I thought you could find what you're after. I had no idea you were thinking of any such thing. Well, it just developed today. Yes, darling, I'm on the brink of an important medical discovery. Why, I practically have it in my grasp. I lack only one vital element. A certain mold that comes only from south America. I've arranged to have Dave, your assistant, go with you. You can set up your laboratory and complete your experiments down there. Oh, you wouldn't mind, would you, darling? After all, it's in the interest of medical science. No, I wouldn't mind. How long do you think you'd be gone? Oh, that depends on how it takes to find the mold oh, thank you, Jason. - Thank you. - Well, now, that's settled. When would you leave? Oh, just as soon as I could get my equipment together. Well, here's to Jeff... Success and a pleasant trip. I'm going to miss you, darling. And I'm going to miss you, too. You'll write to me, won't you? Every day. All ashore! Exploring the shore! Well, guess I better get off. I did all right in the knife boat to Albany. I hope I don't get seasick in this trip to south America. - How's your Spanish, Dave? - I know the book by heart. Jeff, I got you all fixed up on a deck. Much better cabin. Oh, that's swell. See? That's what comes of knowing the right people. And greasing the right palm. - Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye, dear. - Well, goodbye, Jeff. - Goodbye. - Bye, Dave. - Bye, Mr. Graham. - Have a successful trip. - Thanks. May I see you home? Why, yes, thank you. I want you to have a look at these samples. Those boxes are for the pills, those bottles for the powders and these for the liquids. Well, I think you could make the lettering larger. Make it stand out more. Yes, I thought so, too. Well, how's that strike you? Well, that's okay. Very nice. Get a big spread. - Right. Well, Stevens, looks like we're on our way. - Certainly looks that way. Uh, when do you think you could get this on the market? - About three weeks. - Good. How long will Carter be in south America? For quite some time yet. "So keep your fingers crossed. We may know in a week or so what we have" the rest is personal. It looks like he's really accomplishing something down there, doesn't it? Oh, I hope so. It's been over a month now it hasn't seemed that long. Oh, by the way, I have something here I want to show you. Jeff sent it to me from south America. - Oh, it's interesting. - Isn't it? I wonder where it would look best? Over the mantel, of course then that's where it'll be. Right here, huh? I'll have Jason hang it later. Isn't this beautiful? Where did you get it? Oh, I picked a pair of them up years ago in Bombay. Bombay? That must have been exciting. Oh, it was more than that. It was educational you know, people in the orient go far beyond the boundaries of physical life. As a matter of fact, I spent quite some time with a hindu teacher who taught me how to develop the power of the transmission of the will. When you have that, you can have anything you want in life. Mental suggestion? I don't believe it. - oh, you don't, don't you? Well, why do you suppose you're here tonight? You came because I wanted you to. You're wrong. I came because I wanted to. Hi there, senor Gonzalez. Here... come here. Come on. Don't be shy. Oh, you don't say, huh? Next time, make sure that her husband's not around. Hasta la vista, my friend. Or words to that effect. How you doing? - Okay, I guess. You know, that mold was just what the doctor ordered. I've mixed enough of it with the drug to start to work. You mean success at last? Oh, don't write that q.E.D. Quite so fast. You know we haven't tried it yet. Tonight we're going to inject these eight monkeys with various diseases, then we'll try the drug on four of them. That ought to prove something. Pipe down, sweetheart, he wasn't talking to you. Right now I could do with something to eat. How about it? Si, senor, my assistant sefor Gonzalez and I will prepare for you a most delicious meal. The food, she is coming out soon now. Uh, maybe later, too. All right, chef. I'll write Mary a letter while you're doing that and tell her how I could use a good meal. I resent that. How about that lettering? Is that more what you had in mind? Oh, yes, yes, that's much better we'll give this the biggest exploitation campaign any drug ever had. Well, here's three testimonials. Two of influenza, one of pneumonia. Uh, did these people actually use the drug? Oh, yes, but after they were well on the way to recovery. Oh. I see. What are you doing? Trying to get up the nerve enough to go in there and see what happened. You mean you haven't been in there yet? No, to be honest with you, I'm about half afraid. - You want me to go in? - Oh, no. No, I've gotta face it sometime. Come on. - All four of them are dead. - Yes. But look at the others. Alive and kicking. Dave, it works. It sure does how do you feel, professor? Oh, I don't know. I can hardly believe it. Well, there's your proof. The four you gave the drug to are alive. The other four are dead. I don't know what more you want. Gee, it's marvelous, Jeff. You did it, you did it. Gonzalez is congratulating you, too. You know the wonderful part about it is is that substance we were looking for in the mold can be made synthetically back home. Hey, say, Graham will be glad to hear that. He was sure getting itchy fingers to put this drug of yours out on the market. Yeah, well, he can go to work on it as soon as he gets my formula. Wait'll he sees this. Yeah. He'll mail ya a medal. - Yes, Stevens. - Take a look at that mmm, that's interesting. Looks like we got zymurgine on the market just about the right time. To be on the safe side, we better double our output. - Cable for you, Mr. Graham. - Oh, thanks, must be from Jeff. Well, let's see what the wonder boy is doing down in south America. Well, he's completed his experiments on zymurgine. He's sending the formula by airmail. It'd take us quite a while to change our setup, wouldn't it? - Certainly would. - Well, forget it. With the uprise in this new flu epidemic, we're bound to lose out on sales. Yes yes, Mr. Graham? Uh, miss Rogers, bring in your book and file 6-8-3-4 we've developed a new interest temporarily. Take a cable to Jeff Carter. "The formula which you are sending will be put into operation as soon as is humanly possible. My congratulations to you on your success. Certain new developments make it imperative for you to remain in south America for further work in a day or so, we'll mail you an outline of these new experiments. Again, my heartiest congratulations and best wishes" send that right off. Jeff will be gone for quite a while. You think we ought to put on a new man? That's a good idea. All right. Uh, get me Mrs. Carter. It's been a very pleasant evening, Mary. I've enjoyed the dinner, the play, but mostly your company. Of course, the play could have been better I thought it was quite good. A little old-fashioned, don't you think? All that triangle stuff. You don't believe it could have happened? Oh, it could have happened, of course, but not exactly that way. It was a bit too far-fetched. The reason for suspicion? Well, after all, I thought she was an attractive girl. I think he had a reason to be jealous. It served him right, he left her alone too long. And when Jeff comes home, I'm going to make it my business to make him see that show. - If it's still running. - What... what do you mean? Well, Mary, certain things have come up that make it necessary for him to stay there a little longer. Well, he didn't say a word about that. He wrote that he'd completed his experiments and that zymurgine was a proven success. I thought from his letter that he'd be back any day now. Scientists are like doctors, their work is so unpredictable. Uh, waiter, check, please. It's been a lovely evening, Mr. Graham. I can't thank you enough. I can't tell you how much our association has meant to me. I was hoping maybe it meant something to you, too. Well, it has. I guess I'd better go in now. Good night. - Good night. - Why, Mrs. o'Connor. - Oh, I'm so glad you're home, ma'am. I've been trying to get you all evening. Well, what's the matter? - Tommy's sick. - Tommy! I called the doctor. He's upstairs with him now. - Tommy... - Hello, mommy. - You're Mrs. Carter? - Yes - I'm Dr. Williams. - How do you do, doctor? What is it? Shall we go outside? He's a pretty sick boy, Mrs. Carter. I'm afraid it's influenza but he was all right when I left home. Is it very bad, doctor? It's a little too early to say yet. His fever is quite high. It's over 103. If it gets any higher, call me. All right. Dr Williams? Dr. Williams, can't we give him zymurgine? - Zymurgine? - Yes. Oh, yes. I'm afraid I couldn't honestly recommend that it hasn't been thoroughly tested and proved. But Jeff, that's my husband, he wrote me about it. He worked on it. It's a positive cure. Well, I can understand your enthusiasm, Mrs. Carter, but unless we're sure oh, but you don't understand. Wait, I'll show you. "After extensive tests, I can say without hesitancy that zymurgine is a definite cure for influenza." So, you see, it must be so. Mrs. Carter, I would advise against it. Good night. - Good night. How much is that? 65 cents, please. Thank you. Mr. Reed, do we have any more zymurgine in the stockroom? - Zymurgine again? - Everybody's after it. Don't know why. From what I hear, proved nary too effective. Well, you can sell almost anything if they advertise it enough. - Cable for ya, genius. - Oh, thanks. Well, it's either from Mary or Graham. Take a guess. - I'll take Mary. On account of I like her better than Graham. That makes it unanimous. What's a matter? It's from Mary. Tommy's sick with influenza. Oh, gee. She says they tried zymurgine and it doesn't do any good. He's getting worse. But I know it works. We proved it. - Yeah, sure, we did. - Come on, I've got to go to town. We've got to send Mary a telegram. - Buenos dias, senors. - Buenos dias, José. Well, how's business, José? Well, sometimes she's good and sometimes she's bad. Now it's good and bad. You sure got everything from soup to soy beans here. Clothes, vegetables, materials, canned goods, medicine, I... Jeff, come here. Zymurgine? José, where did you get this? Oh, that is very fine medicine, senors. That is from the states. How long have you had it? Oh, long time now. Maybe one month. But Graham hasn't had my formula that long. Look at the label on the back see what the contents are. Well, this isn't my complete formula. This is the old one I can't understand how he got a hold of it. But I'm beginning to understand our little trip to south America. Yes, and a lot of other things, too. That man Graham is a disgrace to our profession. When I get home, there won't be a single organization that'll do business with him. Now, don't worry, Jeff. Tommy's gonna be all right. He better be. - And don't worry about anything here either. I'll take care of everything. And I'll close up the lab. Thanks, Dave. You've been swell I just can't understand how I've been such a fool. You mean about Graham, huh? Yeah when I think of how he must have laughed at me behind my back. Why, it's... it's just like he'd taken my head, my mind and brain and used it. Used it like something you've bought in a store. Only he didn't buy it. He stole it well, now I'm going to get it back. Now [I'm going to use it, not Graham. If anything happens to Tommy... I told you to stop worrying about Tommy. Nothing's gonna happen to him. To think that I've been living in another world. Why, I haven't been fair to Mary or Tommy or even to myself. - Hey, sir. - Now, I'm back to earth. - We better get going. - Yeah. No, Gonzalez, you stay here and clean up the joint. Mrs. Carter... Mrs. Carter. This just came. Hello. I'd like to speak to Mr. Graham. What? Out of town? Thank you. Doctor Mrs. Carter, I... I can't tell you how sorry I am. - Oh, hello, Jason. - Good evening, Mr. Graham. - Glad to see you back, sir. - Oh, thank you. It's nice to be home. Anything happen while I've been away? No, sir. Things have been rather quiet. Oh, uh, Mrs. Carter called. Oh, really? Get her on the phone at once. Very good, sir. Hello? Who? Just a moment, and I'll call her. Mr. Graham's on the phone. Graham? Tell him I'm not home yes, ma'am. No, wait a minute. I'll speak to him. Tonight? Yes, I think I'd like to see you. No, I'd rather come over to your place. Yes, I'll leave right away. You can go to bed, Mrs. o'Connor. I'll be out a little while Thank you, Jason. You may have the night off. Thank you, sir. Have a good night. Hello, Mary. So nice to see you. It was good of you to come over. I hope you're not angry at my calling you so late. - No. - Let me take your coat. Thank you. Your purse? Please sit down. Mary, I've missed you. I tried to reach you, but you were out of town. Oh, a little business trip. Would you like a glass of champagne? - Yes, I think I would. - Fine. Mr. Carter. Hello, Mrs. o'Connor. Where's Mrs. Carter? She went out a little while ago. Well, how's Tommy? I said, "how's Tommy?" I thought you knew. Knew? Knew what? What are you trying to tell me? He's dead - Where's Mary? - She's out. I said where is she? She went over to see Mr. Graham. Graham. Mr. Carter! More champagne? No, I think I've had enough now. Mary, there's something I've been wanting to tell you for a long time. Yes? I'm sure you must have known all along how I feel about you. No, Mr. Graham. I don't think I ever really understood you until now. I've loved you ever since I first met you. Is that why you sent Jeff down to south America? Well, I must admit you were the inspiration for the idea. You had no intention of bringing him back. You meant to keep him down there, didn't you? You haven't been too lonely without him. Mary, you have to listen to me. I'm crazy about you. I've always wanted you. You don't think I came here tonight just to let you make love to me, do you? Mary, I don't understand you. You're a murderer you killed my son. I killed your... Jeff told you how to make up the drug that would have saved Tommy's life, but you didn't. You let him die Mary, you don't know what you're saying. You're hysterical. No, I'm not. And I'm going to kill you just as sure as you killed my son. Surely as you killed hundreds of other people. You let all of those people die, Graham. Jeff. Including my son. You've taken everything in my life away from me. Wait a minute, Jeff. You've got to let me explain. - Don't, Jeff! - Now you want my wife? I'm going to take something back that belongs to me. Stay where you are. Stay where you are. Something I've got to have. Jeff. I killed him I had the feeling that Graham was me. Me, Jeff Carter. My mind was his. My brain was in his head and I knew that I must have it back to make it mine again. Don't you see"? That's why I killed him. Just to get back something that belonged to me. That's all yes. I think I understand. I know that nobody can help me. I know that now Jeff. Jeff, darling. Jeff, darling. Don't worry. He'll be all right. I'll do everything I can for him.
