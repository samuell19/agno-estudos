I'll open this thing up right away. Don't want you not to have your favourite kind of cat food. OK, OK. Look at this. Mm-hm! Well? Go on, there it is. [PLAINTIVE MIAOW] So it's not Coury's cat food. It's OK with me. Hey, don't run out on me now, you son of a b... cat. Come on. - Marlowe. - Hey, Terry, How you... - What are you doing up at this hour? - Come in, I'll be right there. What am I doing at this hour? Terry Lennox. Hey, Terry. I was just... I was just feeding my cat. You oughta be feeding your cat a little more, too. What happened to you? Beauty, isn't it? Proud of that son of a bitch. - Would you and Sylvia going at it again? - Uh, yeah. You like to hear the sordid details? Yeah, yeah, I've heard 'em before. You like to lose a couple of bucks? Oh, yeah. - I got an L. Yeah. - L? D. Four sevens. You really think I believe you got four sevens? - Probably, you think I don't have any. - Yeah. - Well, then I gotta say five sevens. - Uhm... - I challenge. - Challenge. How many you got? - None. - None, yeah. I got three. That's good. - Who were the three DiMaggio brothers? - Vince, Dom and, uh... - Joe? - Joltin' Joe, yeah. - Want me to fix up the couch for you tonight? - Uhm. Well, Marlowe, that's what I'm here to talk to you about. - I really need more than that. - You wanna sleep in my bed? There's gonna be a lot of people looking for me as a result of my lovely wife. - I really need a ride. - Where do you want me to take you? - Tijuana. - Tijuana? - Tijuana now? - Yeah. Tijuana. - Thanks, Marlowe. - You take care of yourself. Don't worry about me. - Vaya con dios, huh? - Oh, thanks a lot. - Arizona. - Phoenix. - Kansas. - City. - How about Michigan? - Detroit? Milwaukee? Right on. - Hey, your turn. - Oh... uhm... - Montana. - Montana, Montana... Billings. - Florida. - Oh, Miami. - Right. - How about Washington? Washington? - Washington DC. - Girls, did you see my cat? - I didn't even know you had a cat, Mr. Marlowe. - Did you say you wanted a hat? No, no, you don't look fat. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. - Is your name Marlowe? - No, my name is Sidney, uh... Jenkins. Come on, let's go inside, Marlowe. We wanna talk to you. - I'm looking for my cat. - Forget the goddamn cat, Marlowe, come on. Forget the goddamn cat? All right, I see. OK. That cat means an awful lot to me. You tell me to forget about it. Must be something mighty important. - Sit down, Marlowe. - That's okay, I'd rather stand. I don't mind sitting neither. Marlowe, I'm Sergeant Green. This is Detective Dayton. Yeah, I saw your badge. Where's his? Uh... where did you go last night, Marlowe? Oh, is this where I supposed to say "What is all this about?" And he says "Shut up, I ask the questions"? Yeah, that's right, Marlowe, so just answer the questions. Where did you go last night? Oh, maybe if I knew why you wanted to know, I could remember. - Are you gainfully employed, Marlowe? - I don't know. - Where do you work? - Yeah, yeah, I heard you. I understand English. Believe me or not, I'm a private detective. I have my own agency. Those girls are vicious. That shot, I take a better picture now, but business hasn't been as good as it used to be. I'm sure you guys understand that. Marlowe, you know a white guy by the name of Terry Lennox. Oh, yeah, who says I do? His address book, and that yellow bomb downstairs in your garage. - So? - Marlowe, just answer the question. - You wanna know what I did last night? - Uh-hum. My cat woke me up in the middle of the night. He was really hungry. So, I went to fix him his favourite cat food, Coury Brand, the only kind he eats. And I was out of it, so I picked something else up and the cat clawed the hell out of me. Just he wouldn't touch it. So I... I went out to the Thriftymart, you know, it's open 24 hours, to get some Coury Brand cat food, and they were out of Coury Brand cat food, son of a bitch. So I got a couple of other cans. I came back and I switched the labels on the cans around... - and the son of a bitch cat just left... - Marlowe, will you forget the goddamn cat? - Yeah, I know. - Coury Brand cat food, Marlowe? - Yeah, you got any? - Here, take this. Now, we know what time Terry Lennox left the Malibu Colony and we know about what time he got here. Your girlfriends were so busy making hash pies, they didn't notice anything. - What the hell is this, Marlowe? - It's a baby shoe. Now, Lennox left his car parked in your garage and then he went somewhere. Now, since you went somewhere also, it would seem logical to assume that you went somewhere together. Now, suppose you tell me where. Well, I tell you, I don't have to answer any questions you guys ask unless you have a specific charge. I know that. So if you don't have a specific charge, I'd appreciate it if you'd just go on down the elevator... Dayton, do we have a specific charge against Marlowe? - Goddammit. - We do now. - Marlowe, if you broke my partial... - Oh, your partial... you bet your ass! - Get up. - Come on, - you're OK. I'm OK. - You're not gonna pull this shit, are you? - Read it to him, Dayton. - You gonna read something to me? - You have the right to remain silent... - My rights. Yeah, I got a lot of rights. It's OK with me. "...if you say, can and will be used against you according the law. You have the right..." - You got any cotton candy? - Right profile. Right profile. Is there a merry-go-round around here? - Straight ahead. - Straight ahead. My, my. You are a pretty asshole. - Yeah, my mother always tells me that. - Come on, let's get some prints. - Right here. - Thank you. - We have a room waiting for you. - You got a towel I could wipe this off? - Use your shirt, use your shirt. - This is my good shirt. - [PROTESTS FROM DETAINEES] - Come on. - Come on, you'll all be together in paradise. - Oh, thank you. Yes, yes. Hey, they got you too, huh, man? Hey, hey, man, how's your cat? - Ran away. How's your girl? - She's all right! She got busted at a protest rally. I had to bust the pig that busted her, man. Come on. Come on, goddammit. - Here, he's all yours. - I bought some cat food. Come on, this is the question and answer time. All right, sit down. Sit down! Sit down, Mr. Marlowe. Don't dirty up our joint. Sit down, right here. All right, what's your name, now, again? My name? My name is Donald Duck. You... - ...know my name. - How funny! - What's your name? - My name is Marlowe... Philip Marlowe. - He's a real cutie pie, Lieutenant. - Yeah, how spell out? - He's a smart ass, that's what he is. - That's what I meant. Why don't you learn to say what you mean? He's a real smart ass, Lieutenant. Hi, boys. Who's in there? Uh... J. Edgar Hoover's in there? Sure. They're all peeping through. I'll got you by everything. - It's all right? - Yeah. Sure, all right, look. - With an E? You got an E on your name? - Yeah. - Is that... that uh... that sounds like a fag name. - Fag? Is that what you are? Well, how I'm a fag. - I wanna know about me, but... - You got ladies'... - ...drawers on? - ...anybody called Philip Marlowe has gotta be a fag. - Sounds like an ad for an academy for faggots. - Right, right. Listen, what are you here for, Marlowe? Well, I'm here 'cause I'm getting ready for the big game Saturday. We're playing Notre Dame and I hope I catch a touchdown pass and now... I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm just getting into my make-up. - Oh, fags make up. That's... - You got a banjo? I'll do my Al Jolson routine. This guy sounds like a fag. He'll do your dirty work. What the hell are you doing here? - That's I'd like to know. - I'm getting ready to sing "Swanee". - # Swanee, how was I love you # - Sure, I get it. Al Jolson. Yeah, he was OK. Damn right he was OK. But what I wanna know. What the hell are we doing here? - Just sweating. - You know, you don't tie in. This suit, the name Philip Marlowe. - What the hell are you from, a prep school? - Smart-ass. It was a long time ago. - No, I never went to a prep school. - No, you don't look like prep school. But that's not important. What's important is you'd better have the right answers when Farmer gets here. Here's your man, Lieutenant. A real cutie pie. - Nice to meet you, sir. - Oh, you're looking very good, Marlowe. - Why don't you sit down and stay there? - OK. We don't want you banged up. Somebody might get the wrong impression. Tell me, Marlowe. - Why can't you answer one simple question? - Well, for two reasons. I don't like the way you guys ask questions and I don't know what you wanna know. - Are you crazy? - Yeah. - I'll gonna get one more... - He's the cutie pie, Lieutenant. You're the smart ass, you little honky bastard. - Come on, or I'll throw the book at you. - Yeah, what's the charges? Don't give me that innocent crap. You expect me to believe that your friend Terry Lennox showed up in the night, and you drove him some place a couple hundred miles and he didn't tell you? - That's what I've been telling you. - You wanna hear the charges? OK. - Accessory after the fact of murder. - Who's dead? - Aiding a felon in unlawful flight. - Lieutenant, who's dead? Terry Lennox's wife, that's who's dead. And not a nice dead. - I don't believe it. - Believe she's dead. That's obvious. - So what don't you believe? - I don't believe that Terry Lennox could kill her. You don't believe he could beat a woman to death? - How long have you known him? - A long time. - What's that supposed to mean? - Long time. - A long time. - Long time, yeah. - From college? - I didn't go to college. It was before that. Obviously you didn't go to college. What was his real name? - You guys know his real name. - Yeah, we know it, but you tell me. - Lenny Potts. - Lenny... - ...Potts? - Yeah, it.... - It wasn't fancy enough, so he changed it. - Fancy? Fancy my ass! The man's a gambler, a hood. He's thick as thieves with Marty Augustine. So what does that mean? He was always splitting up with his wife. - Oh, he loved his wife, you know. - Was she... was she cheating on him? Are you cheating on your wife? Maybe. But my wife's not dead. - Was he cheating on her? - Is your wife cheating on you? How come you know so little about your dear old pal, Marlowe? Or are you just dummying up? Last night what did he tell you? That he was in a jam with his gambling associates? That he was fighting with his wife again? What excuse did he give you? Well, the hell with it. Take him out. Book him. - Fuck you! - Stand in line, baby. Come on. So, while I was waiting for my dog to come back, you know, we just went in, we went to the Saugus Cafe and decided, you know, to toss a few. We were getting out, you know, and I get in my car, I get my dog, we're riding down Lankershim Boulevard. Hey, you know,there are more cops on Lankershim Boulevard than in this place. - Yeah. - So I go down... Oh, I... I see the red lights behind me and I figure: "Well, OK, man". So I pull over. - Cat comes up to the car and he says... - OK, Marlowe. On your feet. - Keep it clean, Socrates. - Great. Thanks a lot. - So, anyway, listen, man, you know... - Get dressed, Marlowe. - You're not coming back here. - ...anymore, you know, rapest... - You know what they got in here now? - It's about time. - They got people that smoke marijuana. - Aren't you afraid your lips are gonna... - ...fall off? - Possession... Possession's what you get in here for. You got possession of noses, possession of gonads, possession of life. It's a weird world. Listen, someday... ...someday all the pigs are gonna be in here - and all the people are gonna be out there. - You can bet on that. Listen, remember, you're not in here. It's just your body. See you when you get out. - All right, Johnson, hands on the counter. - But I already said... - Philip Marlowe, over here. - What's going on? - Sign the card. - What is going on, please? - You're free. Isn't that good enough for you? - I was free to begin with. Is anybody gonna give me explanation why my ass has been in there for three days, hun? - Could you tell me something? - Don't know about anything. You know nothin'? Is Lieutenant Farmer around here? Yeah, wait a second. Hey, Farmer. Hey, you guys just now letting me free. I appreciate that. Could you explain to me what's happening? We just don't have any further use for you, Marlowe. Yeah, I know that, but why did you drop the charges? Cause... - Now, we got all our answers. - Yeah, what happened? Terry Lennox is dead, Marlowe. The case is closed. What do you mean, Terry Lennox is dead? Hey, wha... You're not gonna find anything in that. Deputy Morgan, how you doing? What'd they pick you up for? I just heard they were springing you this morning. - Got a way to get home? - No, I don't got no way to go home. These... mothers have a way of bringing you here but they don't care about how you get back. Oh, I'll give you a lift home. Beside, there's a few back issues I want you to see. You might be interested in all. Blew his brains out in a little godforsaken town in Mexico. He left a full confession. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm reading it. You don't have to describe it to me too. - Well, I'm sorry, Marlowe. - You're sorry? What are you sorry about? - It's just another story to you. - Sorry you're so stupid. - All right. - There you are sitting in the poky, taking munch for friend of yours, and he turned you down. - That's my problem, ain't it? - Stupid, Marlowe. But away, there's a layout on you. Pictures and all. Yeah, I see. This is gonna do wonders for my trade. Otatoclan? Never heard of that. Why would he kill himself in Otatoclan? He could have done it in Tijuana. Well, a man at the end of his rope. Never know what the hell they're gonna do. Don't say nothin' about his body. What happened to his body? His wife's family didn't want any part of it. - For obvious reasons. - Obvious reasons! Doesn't have any family of his own. So he's buried in Otatoclan. Yeah, I get the picture. Case closed, all zippered up like a big bag of shit. Terry Lennox wasn't at the end of his rope. The way he talked, Sylvia wasn't dead then either. I don't believe he killed her. I don't believe he killed himself. - Everybody else does. - [PIANIST PLAYS "THE LONG GOODBYE"] - Hi. - Hi, Marlowe. - Where's Herbie? - He's in the can. You practising for the hit parade? Gotta learn this goddamn thing. Thinks it'll beef up the lunch trade. Yeah, I don't see anybody waiting in line. As cheap as I work, he can not lose. Marlowe! Haven't seen you around for a few days. - Yeah, I've been out of town. - Say, did you notice this? Got a new line of sandwiches in, think you like'em. - You'll try anything, Herbie. - Ha ha, well... - How about lunch? - Sandwiches? Never heard of them. - No, I think I'll have a drink. - What is it? CC and ginger. You got any, uh... messages for me? Yeah, I believe we've got a few of them over there. As a matter of fact, you'll find my phone bill in there, too. MARLOWE: Oh, well, I wouldn't worry about that. # There's a long goodbye # # And it happens every day # # When some passer-by # # Invites your eye to come her way # # Even as she smiles a quick hello... # - # You let... # - Hello. This is Philip Marlowe. Mrs. Roger Wade? Excuse me, you got a pencil on you? Oh, yeah. You're Mrs. Wade? It will, the... it depends on the nature of the case. I don't do any, uh... divorce work. Yeah, I understand. Have you tried, uh... filing a missing persons report with the police? Uh-hun. Yeah, well, I guess I could work it in. When do you wanna meet? Yeah, ihat's OK with me. You'd better give me your address. The Malibu Colony. [BEEPS HORN] Come on, Aster. I'm honking my horn. You're supposed to get outta the way. Want me to call a cop? Yeah. - Hi. - Hello there. What can I do for you? I have an appointment with, uh... Mrs. Roger Wade. - Uh... what's her first name? - Eileen. - Uh, well, what's their address? - Jimmy Stewart? - Right. - Right. - Go on in. - Thanks. [DOORBELL CHIMES] WOMAN: Come in. [BARKING] Mrs. Wade? It's OK. You're a nice dog, you do nothing. Mrs. Wade! Oh, shit. OK, I'll stand here. Anything you say. Hello! - Hello. - It's okay. Do come in. Yeah, I'd love to, but your friend doesn't want me to take another step. Oh, come on. In the kitchen, come on. Scoot! - Will you forgive me while I make a call? - Oh, certainly. Do sit down. Dried apricot? Hello? Could I speak to Mr. Lernie, please? Mr. Lernie, hello this is Roger Wade's secretary. Listen, I'm terribly sorry. He's locked in his study writing and I can't disturb him now. But I'll see that he gets your message as soon as possible. and you'll probably hear from him in the morning. Is that all right? Yes. Yes, thank you, I will. OK. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Now, that looks like my Thanksgiving Day dinner. You're Philip Marlowe. You don't look like your picture. - Thank you. - I'm Eileen Wade. You don't look like a secretary. And if Mr. Wade is up in his library working, I don't think you don't need me. My husband is not upstairs in the study. When he disappears like this, I try to cover up for him. - Protecting his image, I suppose you'd call it. - Oh, he's done this sort of thing before? Oh, yes. My husband has a drinking problem. Every so often he reaches a stage when he feels he needs professional help. So he goes someplace to dry out. Is there some particular place he likes to go? Yes, but he's not there. I've checked. I've checked every single place I could think of. Didn't he tell you where he was going? No. We're usually not speaking when he leaves. - How long's he been gone? - Almost a week. A week? Weren't you worried? I mean, uh... waiting a week before you call somebody to find your husband. What are you implying, Mr. Marlowe? Well, I don't mean to be tactless, Mrs. Wade but it doesn't look like you walked into a door. No, as a matter of fact, I didn't. I fell out of bed. Well, Mrs. Wade, I'm gonna need something to start on, you know. You have. He's Roger Wade. - MARLOWE: Roger Wade. Big writer. - Uh-hum, he's a big man, too. Six foot five, weighs 220 pounds. And once you've seen his face, you'll never forget it. - Sounds like some kind of monster. - Only when he drinks. - Would you like a drink or something? - No, no, thank you, Mrs. Wade. - Would you like a cup of coffee? - No, no, thanks. Let me get this straight, now. This is different from some other of the times your husband behaves this way but not different from all the times, is that right? - That's right. - Well, could you explain that to me? Look, I found this manuscript paper. You see, he started out writing something, and then he starts rambling on and on and on. "Dr. V, Dr. V, Dr. V. You must help me, Dr. V." Do you know a Dr. V? I looked in the phone book under Doctors. I never knew there were so many Vs. Could you find my husband for me, please, Mr. Marlowe? - Is Roger Wade his real name? - Why? Well, I figure, if Roger Wade isn't his real name, he might be using his real name. Actually, he did change his name. His publishers thought that... Billy Joe Smith lacked something for the kind the books he writes. Billy Joe Smith. Roger Wade ain't exactly the ticket for the kind of book he writes either. Oh, his publishers are happy. That's all that matters. Probably Smith's the name that most of Dr. V's clients use. Is that a picture of him? I see what you mean about his face. Does he usually walk around in that costume? Listen, Mr. Marlowe we haven't talked about your fee. Yeah, I get 50 bucks a day and expenses. - All right. Would you like an advance now? - Uh-huh! No, thanks. I prefer an itemised accounting. That way there's no misunderstanding. Mrs, Wade, you gonna be around if I have to call you? Sure. I'll be here. Uh... the Lennoxes, Terry and Sylvia, used to live up the beach, did you know them? Very slightly, like one knows most people on the beach. Well, you put some ice on your bruise and I'll go find your husband. Is time enough? Go check your files. Uh... may I help you, please? Uh... yeah, I'm looking for a patient named Roger Wade. There's no one here with that name. Well, he may not be using that name. This is a picture of him. - Do you recognise this face? - There's nobody that looks like that. You look just like my Great Aunt Esther. She passed on a couple of years ago. - Is Dr. Verringer around? - Uh... Dr. Verringer is out of town. - Out of town? - In Phoenix. - Phoenix, Arizona? - May I ask who you are? Certainly. I'm just some guy looking for Dr. Verringer. Those ladies are a lot of help. Crazy ladies. It's OK with me. 611, 612, 6 hundred... - Excuse me. I'm looking for... - 13... - Shh. - ...614, 615, 616, - 617, 618... - It's OK with me, lady. Excuse me. I'm supposed... - ...to meet Roger Wade here and I... - Shh, shh. I saw that old man's pants. With the trouble I'm glad. Oh, I have this book here for Roger Wade... - I'm making... - Shh. - Are you looking for someone? - Yes. No, I'm gonna deliver this book. - Shh, to... to whom are you delivering the book? - Oh, the man who wrote it, Roger Wade. But they told you at the office there's no one here by that name. - Are you Dr. Verringer? - Good morning, Dr. Verringer. Yeah, they told me at the office you weren't here either. This is a private hospital. I can't have strangers prowling about. - I must ask you to leave. - Yeah, I hear... I hear you, Doctor. Could you tell me the nature of your business here? Well, I'll tell you. If Roger Wade isn't here, why do you care? - EILEEN: Are you sure he's at Verringer's? - Well, Verringer denied being Verringer, He pretended he didn't know your husband's name and wouldn't even look at his picture on the book jacket. So I'm reasonably sure that's that's the place where your husband is staying, but the... there is something we could do to make sure. What's that? Well, if you came back there with me, Dr. Verringer couldn't dismiss you the same way he did me. He'd just have to answer to you. I don't have the guts to do that. You got the guts to make that dog behave like that but you not got to - talk to a little jerk like Verringers? - Oh, it's not Verringers. It's Roger. He doesn't want me to find him. He doesn't want me to know why he's hiding out at Verrringer's. What's he gonna do when I go in there? Oh, that's all right. You're a stranger. He's fine with strangers, you know. Apricot? Dried apricot? Well, I tell you the truth is, I didn't eat the one you gave me this afternoon. You know, they give me diarrhoea. Mrs. Wade, what is it that you want me to do? I just want you to make sure he's all right, and try to bring him home if you can. If you have any trouble, I'll back you up. - But I don't think you're afraid of trouble. - Oh, yeah? What makes you say that? Well, I looked at your picture in the paper and I liked what you did for my friend. - Your friend? - I mean your friend. What am I talking about? And... I like your face too. - I feel you're someone I can trust. - Well, you got me, lady. That's far enough, Lucette. - You have to go back. - Come on. - I haven't vote. - You have to go back. NURSE: Thanks, Don. - I have to vote. No! - Your favourite TV show is on. - No, dear. Come on. - I have to vote. - Have you voted yet? - Yeah. VERRINGER: You can handle Lucette. Don, go to supper. VERRINGER: Roger, when you checked in, you paid me $600 cash... leaving a balance of $4400. - $5,000 is my fee, Roger. You know that. - Oh, yeah. Uh... exquisite Styrofoam pitcher. Oh, Jesus, my mouth's burning up. - You got me all drugged up, Doc. - You need help, Roger. You know, I... I... I've been taking a little look around the reservation here. I've been looking at some of the other patients and some of your colleagues, and I... This place stinks, Doc. It's this place that's sick, not the people in it. - You'd like to go home, wouldn't you? - Oh, I'd like to go home. Yeah, I'd like to go home, and I'm going home, cos I'll tell you one more goddamn thing! I'm a man can not stand confinement. So if you don't start present butts to get me out of here, I'll tear you, I'll tear you limb from limb and waltz out through that goddamn wall! No, Roger, you won't hurt anything here. This is my place. - I'm here to help you. - You're here to help me! Why, just this afternoon a man came looking for you. A detective. I told him you weren't here. You don't want your wife to know you come here. Oh, my wife. Of course you don't. Here's the pen. Here's the cheque. - It's all made out for $4400. - Excuse me, Mr. Wade, I don't think it's not necessary to you be forced to sign any cheque, - especially under this kind of pressure. - You have no right to barge in here. I could... You ought to be ashamed. I know you could have me towed away, but why go to any trouble? Say, wait a minute. Who the hell are you? Well, I'm this private investigator who was sent here in this afternoon to find you, but the good doctor here dummied up. You were sent here to find me? Why? Well, I'm supposed to bring you home, if that's where you wanna go. He's taking me home. Don't forget your chequebook. - Roger. - Yeah, yeah, yeah? I want you to understand, you'll be hearing from me again. Yeah I'll be hearing from you, yeah. You come by someday and you have a drink with me, huh? [DOORBELL CHIMES] Roger? Is that you? - [DOG BARKING] - ROGER: Hey, here we are! - The neighbors. - Come on. - Come on, go in the kitchen. Go in the kitchen. - Where is Schnauzer going? - Shh, please, don't wake up - I don't wanna wake anybody up. - Come inside, will you? - Love me, love my dog. - Now, excuse me... huh... - Come inside. Please. - Don't be stupid. - Oh, come on, go in the kitchen. - Come on. - Let's go this way. Yeah, yeah. I go to my little doggy house and you have your nice big house. And you got your friend Marlboro, the Duke of Bullshit, or whatever he is. I don't care. Hey, you go in the house, Roger, and you go in the house, Bowser. [RANTING] - That's enough. - Where are you? - What? What? - That's enough. If you don't stop that screaming and drinking, I'm gonna leave you. I really mean it. - I mean I just want to tell you one... you what? - Nothing. Nothing. Of course, nothing. And let me tell you something. Let me tell you something, all right? Don't talk to me about leaving... you leaving me. I tell you what... I'm... I don't feel well. I... I just wanna go to bed. I... I go... And you, you crazy son of a bitch, you come back sometime, huh? - I'll come back and see you. - Yeah, you come back, OK? Jesus Christ. Goddamn dog! - [RANTING] - You and Eileen don't understand us. He's really a sick man, you know. More so than you might think. He feels he's all finished as a writer. And he sits down and stares at the paper... and nothing happens. I don't know what to do. He really needs help. Yeah, well, I tell you, Mrs. Wade if you think your husband's suicidal, he needs some Freudian analysis or primal scream or I need a cigarette myself. But I'm not qualified for anything like that. I know. Anyway, I'm very grateful for what you've done. - You will come back again, won't you? - Well, I'd love to, but I don't see any necessity. I mean, your husband's home and I think I've done what I'm supposed to do. - Did you know Terry Lennox well? - Terry? Yeah, I knew Terry a long time. You know something? I can't understand how he could do something like that. How could he kill his wife? I mean, they were nice people. Had the nicest heart. I'll tell you something. I don't believe he killed his wife. But I read in the paper, you know, he confessed, and they had a letter and all from him. Mrs. Wade, have a good night. - I'll see how everything is in the morning. - Yeah, OK, thank you again. Ah, yes. Mammy Yokum. I don't wanna disturb you, lady. I'll pick up my bills later. - Hey, Marlowe. - Spiffy. - The boss wants to talk to you. - Yeah, who's the boss? - Mr. Marty Augustine. - Oh, sorry, I only see hoods by appointment. That supposed to be some kind of smart crack? Is it? - It's the only thing I could come up with. - Harry. - Did you think it was a smart crack, Harry? - No, sir. Pepe, cómo lo ves, inteligente? No, Marty. I don't think he looks very smart. - Vince? - No, Mr. Augustine. - Nobody thinks it was a smart crack. - What do you think, Mabel? Ow! Aw! Oh, shit! [MARLOWE GROANS] Excuse me, Jo Ann. I'll be back in a few minutes. You stay right here, hun? You can play the radio if you want. - What is that? - Pain. What is it? Actually, I was on my way to the bank to make a deposit. - It's my laundry. - Vince. All right, pick him up, pick him up, pick him up. All right, bring him. You know what night this is? This is Friday night. It's erev Shabbas. You know where I'm supposed to be in Friday night? I'm supposed to be in temple. - Why aren't you there? - Because I'm talking to a smart guy like you. - Which house do you live in? - Got a cute little place on the top. The top, huh? Penthouse? How do you get up there? - I got my own private elevator. - A private eye with a private elevator. Can I pick up my mail? [RADIO PLAYS "THE LONG GOODBYE"] WOMAN: # ...a long goodbye # MARTY: Get him inside. What is this? It's all the new Rockettes. They're just training. They ain't got no tap shoes yet. I can't believe what I'm looking at. I see you got a Mexican and you got an Irish guy, you got a Jewish fella and an Italian, right? Do you live here? You pay money to live in this place? - Well, home is where the heart is, right? - Yeah, your heart is in the garbage. Sit down. Look at the laundry. Oh, I don't take too much starch in my collars. - All right, all right. Find it, find it, find it. - Find what? Hey, come on. You better get that gorilla to stop that. - And be careful with that stuff. - Hey, come on don't... You know where I live? While you live in this joint, I live in Trousdale. Three acres. - Across the street from President Nixon. - Yeah. I... I take tennis lessons three times a week on my own private court. - Oh, come on. - Do you know that? And that's why I'm in perfect physical condition. Yeah, yeah... Go ahead, smart guy. Punch me in the stomach as hard as you can. Hey, everybody. Shh-shh-shh-shh. Go ahead. He's gonna punch me in the gut. - Go ahead. - No, I'm not gonna punch him in the stomach. I wouldn't think of doin' that. Maybe some other time, you know. Let me explain something to you. You see, I got a wife and I got three beautiful children. You know where my children are? In a very expensive camp on Vancouver Island. And my wife is in an equally expensive health farm where she's trying to lose some weight. The Golden Door. $1,000 a week to lose six pounds. See, I got... I got chauffeurs, I got maids, I got butlers, I got cooks. I live highly. It costs me a lot of money to live that way. I gotta have a lot of money. I gotta have a lot of money so I can juice the guys gotta juice so I get a lot of money so I can juice the guys I gotta juice. And you, Cheapie, you can't take my money. I want my money! What make you think you Cheapie like me would have anything belonging to you? Look, you're very famous. You got your picture in the paper. Everybody knows you. You run a Mexican taxi service. - You made a deal with Terry Lennox. - Big deal? Terry Lennox was my friend. He asked me to give him a lift, I gave him a lift. I wish I hadn't. Your friend was a criminal. - He was a murder. He murdered his wife. - That's a lie. - I know he didn't kill her or anybody, it's a lie. - I'll tell you. I think, that's a minor crime, a misdemeanour, to kill your wife. The major crime is he stole my money. Your friend stole my money. The penalty for that is capital punishment. Well, that's what they call it? Well, I know... - it wasn't suicide. - Look, I don't give a goddamn how he died. I only care about $355,000 of my money he was supposed to deliver to Mexico City. Pepe, put down the goddamn binoculars! "El dinero ha ido a México" - No way. It never arrived in Mexico City. - It did not arrive, see? And it was in a suitcase like this, a suitcase like this. I think you know where it is and I want it. - I don't know what you're talking about. - [KNOCKING] I don't expect a soul. Don't hit me. Open the door. - Marty? - Yes? I'm sorry. I heard some noises outside the car and I got scared. Can I have a Coke? Come in, darling. Move it, sit down. I want you to meet somebody. This is Jo Ann Eggenweiler. This is Philip Marlowe. - Very pleased to meet you. - Do you have a Coke? - Oh, yeah in the icebox. - Harry. Look, is that delicate? Sweet? A little... a little noise in the car, will give her dreams for a week. - It's probably a squirrel. - Marty. I didn't drink it. You don't want this if somebody was drinking it, hmm? It's flat. Look... at that face, a face for a magazine cover. That profile. You're beautiful. And I love you. I do. I sleep with a lot of girls, but I make love to you, right? The single most important person in my life, next to my family. - Huh, Pepe? - That's right, Marty. [SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY] All right, get her outta here! Get her outta here! Get her outta here! Come on. - Get up, get up! - Oh, God! - Open the door. Open it. - Right. Sit him down. Sit him down! That's someone I love, and you I don't even like. You have an assignment, Cheapie. Find my money. Your fault Marty, go quick. You guys so. Come on, come on. I want you to make sure that if he comes down here, you... you follow him and don't lose him. Can you do that? Right. And listen, let me tell you something... My God! [BEEPS HORN] Hey, wait a minute! where you going? What's go on here? Did you see that guy come - barrelin' through here like...? - It's okay, they're with me. They're with you? What the hell? - Where did you get that coat? - [SOBBING] [CAR HORN] Jack, Jack. Good morning, Mr. Marlowe. - Morning, ladies. - Can you help stretch my right leg? - You didn't last time, he might want to help us? - What? No, I can't even touch my toes. I know. It was really quite a night. Can you just push a little harder? - No, I don't wanna hurt you. - You won't hurt me. - Morning, Harry. You have a good night? - Hey, Marlowe. Hey, you know. You know those girls who live next door to you? You know what I think? I think they're a couple lesbians. - That's what I think. - What makes you say that? Well, look at them doing all those contortions together with no clothes on. - Oh, they're just doing yoga. - What? - Yoga, I don't know what it is, but it's yoga. - Yeah what do they do for a living? - They dip candles. - What? Yeah, they got a cute little shop over on Hollywood Boulevard. They dip them and sell them. I can remember when people just had jobs. Listen Harry, in case you lose me in traffic, this is the address where I'm going. - You look great. - Thank you. - All right, I would straighten your tie a little. - Yeah. - All right, I'm proud to have you following me. - Oh, thank you. Nice guy. Duty, duty, duty. I'm always on duty. Oh, you're going to see the Wades. I recognise the car. - Hi, Cary. - Hi. Listen, there's this spiffy kid who's coming up behind me. I think he's OK. - He's a very big fan of Walter Brennan's. - Walter Brennan? OK, thanks. Walter Brennan. Learn how to limp a little bit. Howdy, stranger. - Howdy, stranger. What can I do for you? - I'm following that car. No cars out there. Just some sagebrush and a few covered wagons. - You bring my boy Billy? - What? Left him... yeah I know, on the flatlands to die. I'm gonna get him. - How was that? - How was what? - My imitation of Walter Brennan. - Walter Brennan? Yeah, he said... oh, never mind. Go ahead. Another wise guy, huh? He'll see. He'll see. Where do you think you're going, Harry? You know, you're not supposed to let me see you following me. Now button your clothes, be neat and go sit in the car. OK. Harry, Harry, don't you know you're never gonna be a first-grade hood? Yeah, yeah. - Morning. - Wow, he-he-he. - So you came back, huh? - I hope it's not too early. Too early? I'll tell you something. I just done six miles down that beach, huh? Oh, yeah, you look like you're wearing your working clothes. Yeah, I'm wearing my working clothes. Can I buy you a drink? No. Thanks, a little early for me. - You're looking well. - Yeah, feelin' fine. I had a funny encounter last night with a character named Augustine. Did you ever heard of him? Yeah. Mini fart, uh-hun? You writers have your own - special way of describing. - Thank you, Thank you. - You know why that is? - [DOG BARKS] Quiet! quiet! quiet! He won't bother you. He won't. Sit down! Quiet! - Do you want a dog? - No, I don't, I got a cat. You got a... oh, my wife. - ROGER: Good morning. - Good morning. I believe you know our friend, the Marlboro Man, here. Hello, Mr. Marlowe. Nice of you to come back. - Dropped your cigarette, huh? - Yeah. - Your... your... - OK, I play that. So, look, did you come here to see me or my wife? Well, I actually, just came to see how - you were doing. - Well, I... I have a little idea. I'd like to talk to my wife for a few minutes, So maybe you'd... go out on the beach for a bit and then we'll call you, OK. It's OK with me. I just wanted to see how you were. - I think I'll be going. - Right. Please, Mr. Marlowe, you don't have to go. Can't you stay? Uh... well, on second thought, Mr. Wade, I guess I'll go down and count the waves. Do that. - Sleep well? - As well as ever. As well as ever. Pills? No. Oh, Contessa, perhaps you'd be kind enough to run into the kitchen and get me a bottle of milk? Milk? Is that what you really want? Would you say that once more? I asked: "Is milk what you really want?" You'd think I was drunk already, wouldn't you? I'll make a toast, huh? To us. Oh, God! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, that's OK. Uhm... You know, last night I remember we were talking about something important, but I... for the life of me, I can't remember what it is today. I simply said if you go on drinking, I'm gonna leave you. You're gonna leave me? Yes. You know, maybe, maybe, maybe you've already left me. You know, you've got a wall around you, baby, huh? And that's the same thing. Let's stop playing games with each other now, OK? Because, until such time that you can get into that solid-gold heart of yours that what I need is understanding, until you learn that, it might just turn out that... I leave you. Maybe you should. [SIGHS] Maybe I should. Oh, baby. Aw, Jesus, Jesus. Sit down, sit down. Sit down. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I said that, but you're the only thing I've got left. Don't you know that? Perhaps I'm just your excuse. Yeah, perhaps... perhaps that's true, but, uh... I... I just wish I could... oh, God. You know, if I could only... If I could just get you to understand that... you know, when a writer can't write, it's... it's like being impotent. I understand what that's like too. Yeah. Oh, you do, huh? You do. Balls, baby! Balls! Why don't you remember the good we had together, the beautiful times, huh? Oh, I got an idea. I got... Why don't you call your friend Marlboro Man in here and ask him a couple of questions? - It's none of his business. - None? Do what I say. Now, you ask him, ask him, ask him "Marlboro, when was the last time you made love, uh... at the lighthouse on Point Venus in Tahiti?" Hun? Or out on the lagoon, yeah, that shining lagoon with the goddamn surf booming on the Barrier Reef, hey? Or up on Whitney that night of the blizzard in the double mummy bag, hooh? Ask him that. It's none of his business! Maybe it is. Maybe it is, yeah. - Please don't. - Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't. Balls! Hey! Marlboro! Yeah. Teodor! Well, there, now, Contessa, here he is. Here's the man. You may ask your questions, please. Contessa! Missed the son of a bitch. - You know... you know what I wish you'd do? - What's that? I wish you'd take that goddamn JC Penney tie off, huh? and settle down with me what you not gonna to do a little old-fashioned, man-to-man drinking party. That's OK with me, but I'm not gonna take my tie off. That's all right. You leave your tie on. I'll tell you what I got. I got champagne, beer, Scotch, bourbon, aquavit, port. What you'll have. - What are you drinking? - What I'm drinking is called aquavit. - Well, I'm drinking what you're drinking. - Oh, God bless you. I like to hear that. An awful lot of people say "What do you want to drink? Ooh, I want this, I want that, and a twist of lemon". Balls! Make yourself comfortable. Do you mind sitting in the sun? - No, I'll sit in the sun. - All right. It won't hurt you. I know that. Aquavit. There you go. Jesus Christ. - You wanna lift a toast to anything? All right. - Shall we drink to your wife? - I say we drink to all of us, huh? - That's OK. - Caraway seeds? - Yeah, it's true, it's true. - You been around more than it looks like. - Just a little bit. You know, I got to say it, I don't really want to, in light of your profession, but... - ...you've got a pretty good face. - You study faces? You know, you don't get to grow a face like mine unless you know a lot about men's faces. What about ladies' faces? - What about ladies' faces? - I don't know. - Why'd you ask? - I was just wondering. Christ, you're a real ding-a-ling, you know. You're so funny. What you say doesn't quite make sense. And you're in a little trouble with, uh... Marty Augustine, huh? Yeah. - How much you into him for? - I don't know. I never made a bet. - Then why are you in trouble with him? - Don't ask me. You know him pretty good? The son of a bitch. I'd hate to tell you how much uh... the bastard owes me. - He owes you money? - Yeah. $50,000. - 50 grand? - 50 grand. Won't he pay? Drink up, uh? "Won't he pay?" what Christ. If he'd already paid, I wouldn't say he owed me, would I? - I guess not. - How's your glass? - Well, I guess I could handle a little more. - More today. 50 grand. You must run into a lot of luck, Mr Wade. Most guys lose their undies when they play for those kind of stakes. Lose their undies. - Do you know Terry Lennox? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know Terry Lennox, but he's the kind of guy that if I know him I wouldn't let on I knew him. - But I let have. - Didn't like him much, huh? That son of a bitch. Christ Almighty, I didn't know him. - I hear you. - Son of a bitch killed himself, huh? - I read that. - Yeah? Let's drink to his going, all right. Shit. - You ever think about suicide, Marlboro? - Me? I don't believe in it. - Did you know Sylvia Lennox? - Sylvia. Beautiful broad. I don't know, Marlboro. If I was your age, I think I'd sure as bust my ass to get into something more dignified form of endeavor. I'll tell you that. - Like writing? - No, I'm not talking about myself.

We don't know how he came. - Yeah, what about his personal effects? - Everything was sent back. But we have a list. - You do have a list? - Yes, we have a list. - You make up the lists? - Yes.

I used to have a study over there, right? I did, huh? - I Did. - Roger, you owe me $4,400. You will pay me what you owe me. No, actually, I don't wish to pay you what I owe you?

Take care. - Bye-bye. See you soon. - Let's do it again. - OK. That's a good boy. I apologise for this intrusion, Mrs. Wade. But your husband dislikes paying his bills. I'm sorry. In future, I must refuse to accept him as a patient. Well, we don't accept you as a doctor, quack. Good day, Mrs. Wade. - Gun cabinet's locked? - Certainly. Would you mind closing that door? It's bad enough having guns in the house. Roger. Roger. It's me. Are you asleep? Hi, Contessa... [GROWLS] Looney Tunes, Mr. Wade. I'm exhausted. Would you like something to eat? Yeah, if you got cold baloney, mayonnaise and bread, I'll hang around for a while. I can do better than that. Come on, we'll go to the kitchen. He'll sleep for another five or six hours. Does your mouth ever get so dry, you could put a cigarette out in it? - I don't smoke. - My mouth is really dry. Well, I still don't understand how you get the, uh... the butter in the chicken. When you cook the chicken, how's the butter you cut the chicken, the butter comes out. - I don't understand how you do that. - That's the secret about it. Good. Chicken Kiev. Listen, would you like some cognac, Grand Marnier, liqueur of some sort? - What are you gonna have? - I'm going to stay with the wine. I think I'll just have my beer out of your wine glass, - if you don't mind. - OK. - Have you had enough to eat? - Oh, yeah. - It was the fanciest meal I ever had. - That's nice to know. I think, in a couple of movies I saw people eat like this but they had four or five servants and, uh... dumbwaiters. - You did this all by yourself? - Sure. - You did this all by yourself? - Yes. - Who does the dishes? - I do. - Well, I am impressed. - That's nice to know. - I'll tell you, though... - Would you like coffee? Seriously, I think you oughta consider uh... staying in a hotel or... you have some friends you could uh... spend the night with? I did that once. My husband smashed up everything I owned in the house, practically. When I came back, I found him unconscious at the bottom of the stairs. I'm not gonna try that again. - Yeah, I know what you mean, Mrs. Wade. - I wouldn't do that. - Why don't you call me Eileen? - Eileen. Eileen. OK, Eileen, what was Marty Augustine doing here the other night? - How did you know... - I followed him here from my place. He dropped by to have a word with me. I just was curious to see who else he wanted to talk to, and it turn to be you. Oh, Roger owes him some money. Maybe $10,000 or something like that. He owes Marty? You know what? He told me... told me Marty owed him. You heard what Dr. Verringer said. He hates to part with money. You know Dr. Verringer said I heard a lot of people said that Terry Lennox was working for Marty Augustine. - I don't believe it. - Yeah that's what I heard. - Your husband ever talk about the Lennoxes? - No. - Did he ever talk about Sylvia Lennox? - No. Was your husband having an affair with Sylvia Lennox? Mr. Marlowe, I don't wish to continue this conversation about my husband. Yeah, was your husband having an affair with somebody you didn't know - who just might have been Sylvia Lennox? - Definitely not. Where was your husband the night Sylvia Lennox was killed? You can't come over. Stay back. Here. Hold my tie. Roger! Let me go! Roger! Oh, God. What brought your attention over here? WITNESS: Yeah, we were standing on the porch drinking and having a party over at our place... - I'm glad that you ask. - Sorry. But he never talk with anybody. - But you knew his wife? - We didn't see the guy go in. Was he chasing her, or was she chasing him? Oh, Lieutenant Farmer. How do you know? Just a minute. What we have is an apparent suicide, although we haven't found the body yet. Let's just not get into the witnesses right now. WITNESS: We could see it from the porch. It was right there. And then what happened, after the, uh... screaming and the persons running in? You'll find on a number of occasions, I think he had been under some kind of psychiatric care. Question, don't you know? Answer, he kept... Mrs. Wade, is this list of witnesses to your husband's behaviour at the party substantially correct? Yeah. Absolutely. Everybody is here. Everybody is here having a party now. Everybody's drunk! Your husband was upset over Dr. Verringer's visit? He threw everybody out of the house, passed out and left you alone with Marlowe? No. I asked Mr. Marlowe to stay. And there was no more definite motive you can think of Mrs. Wade, - that he might have had for killing himself? - Listen, why don't you just go? Why you go get a couple of sand crabs, and stick 'em up your nose and just disappear go take a leak or something. You go and join him. Listen, will you go upstairs and tweeze your eyebrows? Just go back or something! Eileen, are you lying about Roger? Are you lying about Roger? Your crazy, Looney Tune husband could have killed Sylvia Lennox. Could've killed Sylvia Lennox. Look... He's not gonna be walking outta there. I'm sorry. I thought the guy was OK. I never saw one like him before, but now... the police say that Terry Lennox killed his wife. - Now, you tell me what really happened. - What really happened? Now, look, Terry Lennox is dead. I wanna know who killed him, because that guy is dead, right? Are you gonna tell me what really happened now? - He killed Sylvia. I think so. I don't know. - You what... what...? You think... you think he killed Sylvia Lennox? Did you just say that you think that your husband killed Sylvia Lennox? You said to me just now that you think... Are you telling me the truth? Is that what you think? I couldn't tell anybody. I couldn't tell anybody Roger had an affair with Sylvia. And Terry found out. And Sylvia wanted to break it off. And Roger was jealous and Roger went to see her and... then she was dead. And then I read in the paper that Terry confessed. - And I don't know what to think. I don't know. - You don't know what to think? Well, I know what to think. I know what to do and I know what to think. Hey, Farmer! I want you to open up the Terry Lennox case. I've got new information. I have fresh evidence, now, for you to reopen the Terry Lennox case. The lady down there, Mrs. Roger Wade, is prepared to give evidence that her husband was sleeping with Sylvia Lennox the night that she was killed. I had my ass busted for three days because you said my friend killed Sylvia Lennox. - And her crazy fa... - We know that Roger Wade saw Sylvia Lennox that afternoon. We know what time he left her. We know he went directly from the Lennox house to Verringer's clinic. - You knew all the time? - We know, he was all the time in sedation... - all the time Sylvia Lennox was killed. - You knew all the time... So, will you do me a favour. Go back to your gumshoes and your handsome peeping and let us alone. - You want me to let you alone? - That's right, baby. Let us alone. You never were a baby, man, you son of a bitch. You're gonna get everything all straightened out. I saw that. That man who walked into the Pacific Ocean gave Dr. Whatever-his-name-is $5,000 for an alibi so you could keep your job? I'm gonna go in, and call Ronald Reagan. I'm getting you kicked your ass off. You're gonna be selling bus tickets, you son of a bitch. Terry Lennox was my friend, you motherfucker! You knew what you were doing all the time. You don't deserve to be alive, you fucking pig! [HUMMING] # There's a long goodbye # # And it happens every day... # [HUMS] Marlowe. How nice to see you. Uh, it's wonderful and so cooperative of you to come over. Well, I must say, I never mind cooperating, especially if I don't have a choice, you know. I think all the boys should sit down. You just stand here. You remember Harry, of course, and you know, uh... Pepe at the bar, and Vince, and of course you know Jack really well. What about that little lady who you gave a Coke bottle to for a nose? Is she still walking around? That supposed to be some kind of smart - remark? - Oh, no, no, no, don't misunderstand me. I didn't mean nothing smart by it. He doesn't think I'm smart. Nobody's laughing. Didn't we do this before? Yes, we did. But I'm glad you asked me about Jo Ann. - Vince, be so kind. - Yes, sir. See, what we have is a problem with communication. I knew it, from the beginning. I don't hear from you any more. I don't get a phone call, I mean, not so much as a postcard. - What's the matter? Where's the money? - I don't got it. That's the truth. Jo Ann. Jo Ann. Come here. You remember Philip Marlowe, hum? - OK, Augustine, I get the point. - No, you don't get the point. - I get the point. - No, you don't get the point. The point is money! - If you lie... you tell me where the money is. - I don't know where your money is. Look, I don't like getting excited like this. I really don't like it. Get up, get up, up! Here. Sit down. Marlowe, uh... You remember the night that... Jo Ann became ill and we had to take her to the hospital? Well, as you can see, she's had uh... extensive treatment. The finest surgeons, had nurses around the clock, the best attention, because, as you know, she's very near and dear to me. And the prognosis is excellent. Excellent. She's going to be fine. Now... I left the hospital that night and I was... I was really upset. - I was... what was I? - Haunted. - What? What? - Haunted. That's it, haunted. I was haunted. Absolutely haunted with the idea that somehow I'd not been fair to her. No matter how many times I would go over my mind, I realised I had not been fair to her. What do you want? Sit down over there, far away. What had she done? Absolutely nothing. You were the one I was angry with. I was taking out on her what I should have been giving you! So I knew at that moment that I had to apologize. I had to apologize in a very special way. It had to be total and it had to be honest. After all, I had caused the girl considerable discomfort. So, I went to the hospital, I went to her room. Nobody was there. It was dark. I took off all my clothes, undressed completely, and stood before her totally naked. And I said to her "Jo Ann, I apologize". "You see a man standing before you with absolutely nothing to hide". Is that right? Yes, Marty. - So what do you want me to do? - I want you to take off your clothes. Well, I'm gonna tell you something. I have absolutely nothing to hide either, but I'm not gonna take my clothes off. I want you get naked so you could tell me the truth about my money. - You wanna take your clothes off? - Would you like me to take off my clothes? - It's OK. - Well, it's a pleasure. As a matter of fact, everybody, Harry take off their clothes. Marty, I don't wanna take off my clothes, I have too many scars. I understand. Go on inside, Pepe go inside and take care of the telephone. In the meantime everybody get takes off their clothes. Harry, take off your clothes. Take them off. - George Raft never took his clothes off. - Help him take off his clothes, will you? Wait, wait, one second, one second. I don't need any help. Jo Ann, just a second, I want you to wait right here. I'd like you to see what goes on. After all, this is what I owe you. I owe this much to you. I understand you... you're nervous. - Well, I'm not nervous. - Yes, you're, you're nervous like I was. When I was a kid, in high school, I used to dread gym class. Absolutely dread it. - Why was that? Yeah, yeah. - You know why? Because I didn't have any pubic hair till I was 15 years old. Oh, yeah, you must have looked like - one of the Three Little Pigs. - It ain't funny, Marlowe. - No, no, no, take it easy. - I'm just... - making a joke. - See? Look, it's very simple. The man is nerv... Just a minute. Look at this. - What's that? - A picture of James Madison. - It's a $5,000 bill. - I know. See, that? You take off your clothes, everything comes out honest. You know how many of these there are in this country? - Couple. - Very few. The 3 of them were in the suitcase that Terry Lennox was supposed to take for me to Mexico. - Where'd you get this? - Box of Crackerjacks came out of the prize. - Bullshit! Crackerjacks, where did you get it? - Well, I'll tell you, a cli... - Where did you get it? - A client... - sent it to me. - A client? That's bullshit. Are you laughing at me? Yes, you're. You're laughing. - I see you laughing. - Well, I... - and I wouldn't laugh if I were you. - Well, I'm not laughing. Is Terry Lennox alive? Are you make it? Did you have a deal with Terry Lennox? Do you think it's funny? - No, no. - Funny to steal $355,000 from Marty Augustine? - Jack, let me see that knife. - Oh, with pleasure, Marty. Give it to me. Harry. Your father was immoral. Cut him. - What? - Cut him. - Where? - Cut it off. - Cut "it" off? - That's what I said, "Cut it off". Marty, Marty, come here. I gotta tell you something. Can't you see that I'm busy? - Why do you come and disturb us? - Marty, this is important. Now, come on. Excuse me, will you, please? What is it? What is it? [WHISPERING] Everybody, everybody out. - Jack, bring me my clothes. - Right, Marty. Come on. - What about our wallets? - Never mind, never mind the wallets, Harry. Shut up! A lot of entertainment for five grand. - Cigarette? - No, thank you. It's OK with me. Hey, hey, where are you going? I had a terrific time but I'm going home. Here. Why don't you keep this for your trouble? You told the truth and I admire that in a man. - If you're in the neighbourhood, stop by. - Oh, yeah, thanks a lot. Especially since my fairy godmother dropped your $350,000 back in your lap. Hey! Hey, Mrs. Wade! Mrs. Wade. Hey, Mrs. Wade! Hey, come on! Mrs. Wade! Pull over! Shit! Mrs. Wade, come on! MAN: # There's a long goodbye # MARLOWE: Ow? Right, right. Chasing after that car, I got hit by a car and I'm in the hospital. Gotta get outta here. Gotta get out of this place fast. Nothing broke, nothing broke. OK, OK. You're gonna be OK. I've seen all your pictures too. Hey, hey. - Oh, yeah, I just gotta get outta here. - Hey. Hey, you listen. You tell that guy it don't hurt to die. - Here. - You know, that's the smallest one I ever seen. Here, here, here. You know, listen, I can't. I got a tin ear, you know. Here you go. - It's for me? - Yeah. OK, I'll practise. See you later. - You shouldn't be out of bed, Mr. Marlowe. - I'm not Mr. Marlowe. This is, Mr. Marlowe right here. How long has he been in here? - How long has he been in here? - I don't know. - I've been off for about three days - Yeah? What's wrong? I've had the flu. Don't breathe near his mouth. Don't spill that. And take care of him. He's important. - Are you checking in or out? - Out. MAN: Hey, Charlie, give me a hand with this swing back, will you? - You're helpless. You can't do anything. - I'm dropping it, Charlie. Well, here's a real bird's nest. - Fake bird, and don't forget the... - Excuse me, ladies. I'm looking for Mrs... Oh, oh. Oh, Mrs. Tooksbury's upstairs. She's the lady in charge. - Mr. Katz, I'm Sybil Tooksbury. How do you do? - And you? It's so good to see you. You're an hour early. I'm just getting all this stuff cleaned out so you can see the house as really it should look. - This staff... - Uh, I'm looking for the lady - who lives here... Mrs. Wade, yeah. - The lady lives here... Mrs. Wa... I'm not your Mr. Katz, you know. - You're not Mr... who are you? - Marlowe's my name. I'm looking for Mrs. Wade. - You're not Mr. Katz? - No. Well, I'm sorry, I can't give you any information. I work for Surfside Realty. You just call them. They're in Santa Monica. And they'll give you any information you'd like to know. If you'll excuse me, I'm very busy. Hey, Mrs. Tooks, uh... Mrs. Tooks, whoever you are, ma'am... I wanna find where's Mrs. Eileen Wade. That's who I'm looking for. - You know where is she? - Mrs. Wade? Uh... I think she's gone to Europe. I... I don't know. I'm not allowed to tell you. I'm sorry, sir. You'll just have to call the, uh... real-estate office. - Ladies, it's OK with me. - Oh, goodbye, Mr. Katz. Nice to have met you. We're dancing in the sand and our bodies are in ecstasy. We're seeing colours, all the most beautiful colours you can imagine. And we're holding hands because we're one, and our breasts become full and our arms become free and our bodies become free. And we are now beautiful. We are now beautiful, and we are now one. - Nothing will come between our bodys... - Hi, girls. Have you seen my cat? The other day he ran away, and I'm leaving town for a couple of days, so. I'd appreciate it, if he shows up, if you could look after him or give him a bowl of milk. They're not even there. It's OK with me. - A melon convention. - Our breasts are full, our bodies warm. We hear music and dance to the music... - Señor Marlowe, I want to show you our town. - Well, it's a beautiful town and you have a lot of beautiful people in it, but I don't think I wanna go sightseeing right now. There are a few things I'd like to get straight. - Maybe it's better if we talk inside, huh? - I think it would be better if we talk in the car. MARLOWE: This is, uh... the largest police car I've ever seen. - It's like a gold chariot. - Very nice, Señor Marlowe, very nice, but... - I think I have to change it this year. - Yes, it is. Look, Señor Marlowe. We're fixing the roads and all those things. - New streets... - And new schools, too. - Trying to build a new school. - We have to do that. Education... MARLOWE: I know how civic-minded you are, but I've come for the truth. - The truth? - Yeah. - The truth about Terry Lennox. - Well, he's dead. You saw the... I know, you told me a good story - and I saw some pretty good pictures of a guy - Thank you. who looked dead, but the truth is coming together now, boys. - Who told you? - I'm prepared - to make a donation to the people of this town. - Who said that? And, since you're their representatives, I can tell you that I'm prepared, right now, to, uh... to give you a... a James Madison. - James Madison? - James Madison. MARLOWE: Yes, a grand grand president, yeah. - Five grand. - Mr. Marlowe, look. - Do you think you can bribe us, Mr. Marlowe? - Bribe? Oh, no. Please, no! Bribe? This is charity I'm talking about. - You can buy a lot of cobblestones. - Well, yes. Mr. Marlowe. - for a little light shown on the matter. - Tell Marlowe. CORONER: Well, I'll tell you what happened to Terry Lennox. - The suicide was a fake, of course. - Absolutely right. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, the doctor... - See, I put the injection so it looked like he was dead, you know, but he wasn't dead, you know? And I put a gun to his head and I told him, you know... that was harmless, then we took him in a coffin. Took the pictures, with the ice. It looked perfect. Yes, yes. We buried the coffin loaded with stones, you know. - What the... - MARLOWE: Mr. Lennox is also charitable man. What did he... - Uh... just a Madison. - You got now. So you know James Madison? Well, we met him for the first time, yes. Señor Lennox is still alive and well, señor Marlowe. How you doin', Terry? Marlowe? I guess if anybody was gonna track me down, it would be you. - Want a drink or something? - No, I don't want no drink. - You get a kick out of that Madison I sent you? - Yeah, I got a big kick out of it. So you murdered your wife, huh, Terry? Well, I killed her, but you can't call it murder. Wade told her about Eileen and me, she started screaming. She was gonna tell the cops. She knew I was carrying money for Augustine. She was gonna turn me in. I hit her. I didn't try to kill her. I hit her. I didn't mean it. I saw the photographs. You bashed her face in. She didn't give me any choice. You didn't have much choice, huh? So you used me. Hell, that's what friends are for. I was in a jam. Come on, have a drink. I had a dead wife, $350,000 that doesn't belong to me. - I had to get out. It's as simple as that. - Simple as that? Goddamn simple. Cops have me legally dead, Augustine's got his money. He's not lookin' for me anymore. I got a girl that loves me. She's got more money than Sylvia and Augustine for together. - What the hell? Nobody cares. - Yeah. Nobody cares but me. Well, that's you, Marlowe. You'll never learn. You're a born loser. Yeah. I even lost my cat. # Hooray for Hollywood # # That screwy, ballyhooey Hollywood # # Where any office boy or young mechanic can be a panic # # With just a good-looking pan # # And any shop girl can be a top girl # # If she pleases a tired businessman # # Hooray for Hollywood # # You may be homely in your neighbourhood # # To be an actor, see Mr. Factor # # He'll make your kisser look good # # Go out and try your luck, you may be Donald Duck # - # Hooray for Hollywood # - # Hooray for Hollywood #
