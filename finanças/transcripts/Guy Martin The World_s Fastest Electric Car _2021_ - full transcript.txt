We're not gonna get bored of looking at that, are we? Eh? I'd look at that until we run out of light. Super-charged V8, this. Right? We've been mucking about with these for thick end of 100 years, internal combustion, round and roundy bits, up and downy bits. Running on...dinosaur juice. But the thing is, right... ..come 2030, nine years down the line, right, the government are banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. For centuries, humanity has been quilting our planet in a toxic tea cosy of greenhouse gases. That means no more of these. We're putting our foot to the accelerator in a carbon friendly way, of course, with a ten-point plan for a green industrial revolution. They want us to go down the electric road, which I'm not for it, but I'm not against it. So I need to do a bit more learning. Press the button. The best way to do a bit of learning is find a bit of a challenge, have a go at a race, right? Current electric car, quarter mile drag race record. I think it's possible to go and beat that. Go on, go on, go on, keep going. So that's gonna keep the job interesting. And along the way of building this car and mucking about with this car, we'll do a load of learning, and hopefully, by the end of the day, we'll have come to the conclusion whether electric vehicles are the future. Hey, I don't know. I don't know. But we'll find out. Britain's biggest petrol head is actually an electric vehicle early adopter. Just like that. Fascinated by transport technology, Guy bought a so-called EV of his own, but after 10,000 miles in a Honda E, girlfriend Sharon remains unconvinced. Why am I not starting it? You got the keys? No. Might help, might it? SHE CHUCKLES Why am I driving this car, Guy? Why did you buy this car? You ask that. You don't like it, do you? No. Just think it looks cool. I don't know anyone else with an electric car. No, because they've all got bloody sense, Guy, that's why. Because this road's not ready for them. Sharon's issue is that this city car only has a maximum range of 137 miles. I've got complete range anxiety. You can't go anywhere in this car without feeling anxious all the time about running out of electricity. Even... Have you ever run out of electricity? Yes, I have, Guy. When? You know I have. When? When? Yeah, but you didn't... you didn't run out, did you? No, look, you're gonna be smug about it now because you got it home, but, you got it home with 5% and I had a kid in the back of the car. That child has got range anxiety. She sits in the back and go, "Mummy, have we got enough electricity?" She's three years of age. While Sharon is concerned about range, Guy is focused on speed and researching his drag race record. Are you coming? All right, let's see what it's got this time, eh? In 2016, car journalist, Jonny Smith, modified a battery car from the '70s to set a new road-legal electric quarter mile record of 9.86 seconds. Wow. There she is. What are you thinking? Well, that's what we've gotta beat, an Enfield 8000. Yeah, they made like 120 of 'em. Half of 'em were sold to the electric board down south. Original power output was eight horsepower - this, at the time of the record, was 800. I can build something in me shed but I don't know a right load about electrics. I think it's all about big motor, big battery. What else is there? We need an expert! You'll get electrocuted - be careful, you daft bugger. We're in Wales. We know a man who knows a man in Powys, builds electric cars. Using Tesla technology. This mid-Wales workshop reengineers the fastest motors and batteries available to fit inside classic vehicles. The man behind it all is Richard Morgan. I started committing the first car for a customer five years ago, at home, and now we've got a waiting list of about a year and a half. Is that right? That's Dev Patel's car. You know Dev Patel from Slumdog Millionaire? I know the name. I know the name. No matter what the vehicle, every electric conversion has one thing in common - speed. Oh, so this will be faster than the race car? Oh, no question. No question? I'm not a tree hugging hippy that's saving the planet. No, no. But you wanna go fast. That's just a by-product of the fact that I wanna go faster and an electric is where it's at if you wanna go faster nowadays. Honestly. You wanna see the batteries? Yeah, please. Yeah? Please. See how... Yeah, don't touch anything cos it's gonna be all live batteries. So that's probably enough power in there to run a small home for a day. So that's one house, two, three, four...there's enough power in here to run a small village. How much, how much per pack are we looking at? On average, they're about a grand each module. They're not cheap. Not yet. A typical conversion uses 16 of the Â£1000 batteries. This is essentially an old bus that's got 450 horsepower. 450. It's a handful. And if you floor it... WHOOSHING Even for a petrol head like Guy, it doesn't take long for the electric vehicle experience to become very persuasive. There is absolutely no penalty to pay is there? There's no, no, penalty. So we're overtaking these cars now as if we're in a modern BMW Five Series. Yeah. Without any drama, and believe me I've got my foot, literally, just a little bit on the accelerator. If I booted it... We'd be going into the scenery! Convinced this could be a beautiful relationship, Guy makes his proposal. We've sort of got this bit of an idea, and we think you're the man to help us. Right. Right? Fastest quarter mile in a road-legal electric car. A road-legal electric car? Road-legal electric car. Right. You're the man to make this happen. First of all we need a car. Yeah. Have you got a car? So you want me to... We're leaving this in your hands. Everything to me? Car, the lot? What do you think? My Beetle's quick. Right! It's a bloody beautiful Beetle that he adapted about five year ago, put a Tesla system in the back of this Beetle and he just uses it as his daily driver. Who's driving it? Are you driving it or am I driving it? Well, I...I always like to drive, you know. Good. I always like to have a go. So if we're gonna do it, there's a number of things we're gonna have to do. We're gonna have to get more power, we're gonna have to put it on a diet. Yeah. It needs more grip, aerodynamics, maybe. So there's four things we need isn't there? Yeah. I think the first thing we need to do is see how heavy it is. There we go, magic number - what's it gonna be? Bloody hell, right. Oh, that's not so bad. By that, the toolbox was out, and we was ripping it to bits. Who was the Formula One man to say the most important thing to add is to add lightness? Was that Colin Chapman? There you go. If we can get it to a wind tunnel that'd be awesome. Well, I know a man that can get us in there. It's not cheap, just move the decimal place and then you're on TV. Every inch of this 1972 Beetle 1303 is examined. Keep her going, keep her going. Better out than in. Right, so we've got six. Yeah, 1.5. Yeah. 52.5. That's, that's enough, innit? Wouldn't want that on your toes. The project racks up its first success - a near 5% weight saving. Not bad for half an hour's work. Half an hour's work and not a single penny spent. We like that. But if Guy wants this 50-year-old car to be a record breaker, next, he'll have to learn what makes an EV fast. You ready? Sh... Guy Martin is exploring the new world of electric cars... It's not new, as I've been telling you boys for a long time. ..which has a surprising history that's more than 120 years old. Here we go. The very first land speed records were set in electric vehicles. In 1899, Camille Jenatzy entered the history books with his speed machine, La Jamais Contente. "Jammy Jon-tont", he was from Belgium. 62mph. First man to do 100km/h in an electric vehicle, well, in any vehicle. Yeah, ended up getting shot by his mates pretending to be a pig out on a hunting expedition. At the start of the 20th century, battery-powered vehicles were fast, smooth and everywhere. Yeah, so here we've got New York City. Every third car was an electric vehicle, really, because, you know, internal combustion was in sort of its infancy. There was smoking, there was bloody hand-cranking starting, running like a bag of spanners, and it's shaking about. Yeah, so there's not many positives for going down internal combustion, until early 1900s. Here we go - we're in Texas, right? And what have we got? We've found oil, and we're swimming in the stuff. A barrel of oil was three cents a barrel. And then Henry Ford got on to this. "Oh, right, yeah, I tell you what, "we've got cheap fuel. If we can make a car, cheap car, "then we're on the money." This is when the Model T came out. They were $850, a Model T, when they first came out. Ten years down the line, when he'd refined the production line method, he was turning them out for $300 a car, a tenth of the cost of the equivalent electric vehicle. So it's a no-brainer. Would we say it was the final nail in the coffin, the straw that broke the camel's back? I don't know if we'd use either of those, but, anyway, whatever it was, that was the death of the electric car. From that point on, electric power was only used for specialist applications, like early-morning milk rounds where quietness was important... Off to deliver his milk. You know what I'm saying! Eh? ..or on the moon where the lack of atmosphere makes internal combustion impossible. That's the Lunar Rover. I heard ages ago it had a Sierra back axle in it. Ten million dollars apiece. Through all of this, electric has never really gone mainstream until this man came along. Right? Elon Musk. We all know the name, don't we? South African. Bloody clever bloke. He's taken a software writer's approach to building cars rather than, yeah, a conventional car manufacturer's approach to building cars. The car company where Musk calls himself Techno King is Tesla. The first car came out in 2008. By halfway through 2020, right, they're the most valuable car company in the world. If I'm driving to Grimsby, you'd be doing well not to see a Tesla. What's he doing there? What is he doing? What's he...? Anyway... This is Elon Musk, eh? And this gets everyone talking, like, look, we're sat here talking about it. That just creates massive interest in Tesla, and what does that do to the share price? Through the bloody roof. So, yeah, he's taken a very different approach to making and selling cars, and at this point in time it seems to be working. One in ten UK car sales are now pure electric. And Tesla tops the sales charts. And as Guy heads back to EV expert Richard Morgan's mid-Wales workshop... Looks the part, though, don't he? ..it's Tesla technology that will play a crucial role in the attempt on the quarter-mile record for a street-legal electric car. This is what's gonna be in the Volkswagen Beetle. So that's the battery that goes in the front, that's the battery that goes in the back. And that there is the motor. Anyway we're gonna get it running, we're gonna wire it up and get it going. Martin's here to keep an eye on me, cos everything's disconnected, but it's to save me blowing Wales off the map, cos that could be easily done. 95% of British mechanics aren't qualified to work on EVs. Guy is one of them. So, the circuit is checked to see if it is live before he's allowed to touch anything. We're on? Yeah. Yeah, no, nothing. 0.000. Nothing, zero. Perfectly safe. Making one of the world's most sophisticated electric motors work is little different to wiring a plug. That's it, perfect. Thick latex gloves will insulate Guy against electrocution, while he inserts the three connectors that will make the system live. That way? Other way. That way. That's it. Perfect. All done? We are now live, so we've got 400 volts on here. Once the control box is connected... Perfect. ..the workbench Tesla is ready to be driven. So, connection on. Press the start button. Shall I leave the gloves on? Yes, please. Right, are we gonna go for it? You ready? Here we go. Give it some more. Go right the way up if you want. It's not gonna jump off the bench? No. That'll do. Perfect. Go again? You can go again. 600 horsepower is being generated by 500 kilos of batteries, and the most basic of wiring. Perfect. Instant enough. What sort of faff would we have had to do if we wanted to get that same horsepower out of an internal combustion engine? Far simpler, innit? In fact, electric motors are so simple that you can build one in a van. Are you ready? Are you ready? All you need are paperclips and a fundamental of physics. Right, you saw me wind the coil up, and what we're gonna do here, we're gonna put an electrical current through that, and then you create a magnetic field - as simple as that. The magnetic field that we've created in this coil gets attracted to that magnet there, and then the other side of the coil will be repelled, so it'll attract, repel, attract, repel, which creates rotational motion, which turns a motor, which can move your car. Sort of as simple as that. I think that might be a goer, you know. Come on. All that's left to do is connect a battery to the circuit. Hold your breath, boys. Look at that. Look at that! Attract, repel, attract, repel. Home-brewed motor. It was Michael Faraday who discovered this fundamental of electromotive force - a 200-year-old formula that can power just about anything in the modern world. Right, you've lined up some day today, boy. I'll give you that. We have got a load of electric vehicles. Some of 'em are prototype and some of 'em are already out there. We're just gonna have a go and get a bit of a feel, whether it's a digger, a bus, a push-bike, a van or a car. Right, I'm not gonna go arse over tit going down here. Are you ready? Let's get cracking. What am I gonna go in first? I was never cool enough to go on the back seat. This is the Equipmake EBus. Designed by a former Formula 1 engineer, its motor has few moving parts, so it's easier to maintain than a diesel. Bit tight, this one, boys. Bit tighter, bit tighter. Ooh. Use all the kerb. I paid my entry fee. It's all there for using. We're not messing about, boys. This is the fastest bus in the world. Yeah, take the limiter off, it will do 100mph, but they knew I was gonna be driving it, so they've left the limiter on. Rightly so, I'll tell you, cos it'd be over that bank upside down in that field! Like all electric vehicles, the EBus has no tailpipe emissions. A recent study suggested swapping diesel buses for electric ones in a city like York would save Â£5 million in health costs in the first year alone. I'd much rather walk through a city centre with electric buses rather than diesel buses. Yeah, why wouldn't you? Why wouldn't you? Fantastic. And it survived without one issue. The brakes didn't fade. THUD That was a cone we got. Look, there's the battery. It's still saying it's next door to full. 90%. So if I'm murdering it, that's gonna last a lifetime, in't it? That's gonna last a lifetime. Beautiful. Beautiful. So, electric can handle mass transportation. But what about something more specialised? This is a Â£116,000 electric Porsche. Now, I've gotta get this right. The Porsche man did say, "You need to say the name right." He said, "Oh, it's a 'Porsch-eh Tie-khan'." Not in Lincolnshire, mate. It has 680 horsepower and a 160mph top speed. The range is 240 miles - at least that's what they're saying. Hm, we'll see. We'll see. Not with a dickhead like me behind the wheel, I can tell you. All it takes to understand this car... Are we all right? Can we go? ..is one firm press of the pedal. WHOOSH Shhhhh! That's fast. That's fast. That's fast, boys. That's fast. That's fast. That's fast! I don't get tongue-tied very often. That's fast. 130, 140, 145. Hoo-hoo! That is fast! Oh, that is... Hoo-hoo! How many times have I said that now? And compared to its petrol equivalent, a Taycan should go at least twice as far for every pound spent on fuel. I'm blown away. What a piece of kit. The next vehicle Guy tests will show that EVs might be fast, but they aren't foolproof. CRASH So far, Guy Martin's shown that buses and sports cars have an electric future. But what about every tradesman's workhorse, the van? Right, I'm only allowed to do one minute on each vehicle but I think we could have half hour on that, couldn't we? What a piece that looks, don't it? This is the Morris JE Van. Can we have a look inside? Looks can be deceiving, can't they? Oh, feel that quality. Bloody hell, look at that. Look at the carbon fibre on the dash. That's beautiful, innit? It went as lovely as it looked. And didn't it look a peach. Beautiful. I like the thinking, get a 200 mile range on it, and it's a city delivery van. That's what it's gonna be. You get two euro pallets in the back which is a bonus, with a tonne payload. What more do we want? Have to have a word with 'em about the cup holders. I've only got a couple of cup holders. This is Â£60,000. It's a lot of money for a van. Yeah, but get its sign written up, treat it as a piece of advertising and you can just about justify it. Industry experts predict that within five years, EVs will have reached price parity with their petrol and diesel equivalents. Hey up, boy, it's a cool thing, it's a statement, innit? it's very much a statement. Electricity will play a part in commercial vehicles, but what of Guy's personal passion, the bicycle? This 60 miles per hour ebike costs Â£20,000 and has been bought by people like Simon Cowell. This is what he said, this is what Simon Cowell said. "Some good advice, if you're buying an electric trail bike "read the manual before you ride it first time. "I have broken part of my back, "thank you to everyone for your kind messages." So Simon Cowell has spannered himself by riding one of these. Give her a whirl. I'll get me skidlid on just in case. I've put my overalls on, just in case. What could possibly go wrong? Ready for action, boss. Luckily, unlike the multimillionaire music mogul, Guy's very experienced with high performance two-wheeled machinery. BLEEP! BLEEP! Bugger, sorry about that, boys. They said, "Oh, it will lift the wheel in third," and I thought, "Well, I know what I'm doing, mate. "Don't you worry about that. I can take it." So anyway, I sets off in like first, I just think, "Flick it to 3." Opens her up, boof, straight off the back. Oh, it's not dickhead-proof then, is it? Obviously not. Come on, couple of laps. A characteristic of all electric vehicles is that they provide instant torque from very low revs. Just so different to anything else I've ever ridden. Needs a bit of time to get used to it. I can see where Simon Cowell was going wrong. If I was to sit on its back wheel, it's supposed to wheelie. Once I spent an hour on it, it all felt a bit more normal. I loved it, I loved it, I was trying to get as near to you as I could. Smoked you in a couple of places, didn't I? That is a rocket ship. As Guy's final vehicle will prove, there's nothing electricity can't power. Yeah, if I've gotta pick one thing to drive all day, boy, I'm in this. She's mint. This is a little electric digger. They've used 800 kilos of lead acid battery so you've got that mounted as low as possible, so it's really stable on inclines. And you can plough in to stuff and it's not gonna spin its wheels. I'd have still been in there now, boys. Are you not jealous watching me do this? Just moving? What, to do what with it? No, just moving it, mate. It's the best thing in the world! Yeah, I was more than impressed with its capability, and then we got out, and it did its party trick. Where it's remote controlled, you can control it from the phone. That's just a phone. That's just a phone, Bluetooth to that. You can run hydraulics off this, you can run a pecker on it, you know like for breaking concrete up, you can run a road sweeper on it. You could put fork truck tines on it. A universal tool. Once you've got used to that, that's the future. So in every role that we've been testing today, electric has come up trumps. What fun we have had double checking that electricity is the future. What, what fun we've had! But the next stage of preparing the Beetle for its drag strip record attempt is nothing to do with fun. Richard and Guy need to seriously consider the fact that this Beetle could be a death trap. Oh, my biggest fear of running this on the drag strip is a Beetle was never designed to go 130-odd miles an hour. These things are fairly likely to flip over when the wind gets under 'em at high speed. They're not designed to be doing much more than 100 miles an hour. All right? All right at the front. So we're coming here just to confirm to ourselves that she's not gonna take off. Straight back. Straight back. Straight back. Straight back, straight back, sound job. It makes me a little bit more nervous that somebody like Guy Martin is driving it. I don't wanna be the man that killed Guy Martin. I mean, to be honest, if I end on me roof at 120 mile an hour, I'm not that bothered, but obviously the risk assessment, it wouldn't go down so well, would it? What would the paperwork be? Onerous. Onerous. I don't know what that means. Anyway, there'd be a right load of paperwork, it'd be coming out your lugholes, man. The team are in Nuneaton, and the world's oldest automotive wind tunnel. The Beetle is sat on load cells just like posh bathroom scales. Right, when we get those fans up and running, it'll pull the air over the car and we will know if the car's gonna take off because the load will decrease on the load cells. But before they test the car... Come on, Dave, wake her up, man. ..Guy tests the tunnel. Give her some welly, let's have the full force. 250 kilowatts a piece them, one megawatt. Let's see if I'm gonna end up in them fans. I don't think so. What do you think? That was a breeze. The test programme can begin, under the watchful eye of aero engineer, Kevin Chow. It's moved about a bit. Nothing's flown off it yet, the mirrors are still on it. I'd call that a win. The live data from the wind tunnel's scales reveals the worst. Go on Kevin, what's it telling you? It's telling me that it needs a bit of work. Right. At 130 miles per hour, an invisible force of 200 kilograms is trying to pull the car off the road. 120 of that's on the rear, 79 of it's on the front. It's not the most desirable characteristic of the car. So you're saying it makes a good aeroplane but not a good car? Yeah, yeah, that's one way of putting it, yeah. Put smoke over it, see what it looks like. The smoke trail shows how air interacts with the car and reveals where the problem is. You can really see that the smoke attaches itself like glue to the rear window and boot area, and that's what we wanna try and avoid, yeah? Yeah, cos basically as the air flows over the back of the vehicle, the act of pulling that air down also imparts an equal and opposite force on the vehicle, sort of like pulling it up, so that's where all of the rear lift is coming from. So in order to reduce the rear lift what we need to do is that we actually need to separate the air so that it doesn't stay attached over the rear of the vehicle. The team sets to work improvising a spoiler, so-called because it should spoil the air flowing over the back of the car. Yeah, it's not the finished product but it'll just point us in the right direction, it'll just give us a bit of a, a bit of a cue. That's not gonna fall off in a breeze. They also try to reduce lift by fitting a front spoiler. So this goes above, like that. So the way that works is that you're essentially reducing the amount of air that goes underneath the car, so instead of going under, it basically goes sideways around the vehicle. Right. Let's get some numbers again. Sound job. Right, strike her up again. The target figure here is something less than 200 kilograms of lift. What's the damage? What's the damage? Oh! Well, there you go. The spoilers seem to work. The lift that was 200 kilograms at the start of the day is reduced to just over 100 by the end. It's a lot. It's ama... That's a bloody lot. Happy with that, mate. I think the main conclusion from today is we know it's not gonna flip on to its roof at 140-odd miles an hour. Pretty much, yeah. Your insurers are happy. You're happy. Job's a peach. Right, go on, how we looking, boys? And girls. Guy's back in his shed, and back to basics... Camera's in place. Microphone. ..to discover more about the science of batteries. What do I say? Check, check, one, two. So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do a bit of an experiment to show you how a battery works. They are all small pouches of chemical reactions discovered by a science genius in 1799. Alexandra Volta. He was a man that sussed the voltage job out. Right, what we've got here, we've got a tattie, right, and we need two dissimilar metals. I've got one of your nan's posh, that's not mine, one of your nan's posh silver spoons. You got that? Can I see that you can see me? We've got here, we've just got a nail which is a zinc nail. Have you got that? We're gonna stick that in the tattie, right. And there we've got your nan's silver spoon. Right? How we looking? What we've here is a battery. I'm gonna put the negative on the nail, and the positive on the silver spoon. Look, 1.1 volts. Out of a tattie. Yeah, so what we've got here is an electron flow, and what the zinc is doing is giving away its electrons, and the silver spoon is a greedy bugger and it's receiving 'em... It wants 'em all. Right. It wants 'em all. The tattie, because it's acidic, allows the chemical reaction to take place. That makes that become a battery. If we put something in between those, it'll power it. So whether it's a light bulb, a calculator, an electric motor, anything in between there, it will power it. Obviously we're not gonna get a lot of power out of that, but we can do sums. With a second cell for a bit more voltage, and some hot wiring skills... Hang on, don't rush me. ..Guy's potato battery... Hang on, can you see this? ..can power a calculator. Bloody hell, man. Go on, give me some complicated mathematics to put in to the calculator. 1 + 1 = 2. Ho-ho-ho-ho! This principle of two metals and an electrolyte is the same principle that underpins every battery in every electric vehicle. Let's have a look. But there is a potential downside to the chemical recipe that makes a battery. A risk that concerns many consumers... ..fire. A number of high profile incidents from around the world have seen cars burst in to flames. The electric car's battery components were left burning and exploding in the street. Guy's going to find out if this is a risk he might face during his record attempt. Two jobs today, job number one. How easy is it to set light to an electric car? Job number two, how easy is it to put out an electric car that's on fire? The Horiba Mira Test Centre in Leicestershire brutally tests batteries to destruction. Today, a new battery will be subjected to the worst case scenario, a short circuit caused by the cells being ruptured during a high speed collision on a motorway, or drag strip. How we looking? Are we ready for action? We've got a relay, I'm gonna control that with this little switch. That's gonna swing the big breaker in there which is then gonna join those two wires together which then should hopefully set light to the battery. And if it gets out of hand, we've got these boys. So, let's see what happens. I'll get the visor down. Are you ready? Three, two, one. Ooh, she's away boys. Let me pull that down. Instant. Instant. But aside from some charred cables, the battery has not burst in to flames. These latest cells have multiple fuses designed to stop overloads from reaching the battery. Plan B, come on, stand back. Even using a metal plate to short-circuit as many terminals as possible doesn't make the battery catch fire. These things aren't easy to blow up. There's only one thing left to try. Apply an external heat source. But again, this latest design of battery pack remains intact. Tell you what, this stuff is flame resistant as well. Sound, if that'd been a tank of petrol we'd have had her blazing a long time ago. The kitchen sink's been at it, yeah. They're safe as houses. It's time to up the ante and make an entire electric car burn. Guy Martin's about to find out what happens when an electric car catches fire. This early EV has been loaded with older battery packs that lack the safety fuses of more recent designs. Excuse me if I've got holes in me socks. Guy himself has to take his PPE to the ultimate level. Now, shake your head, got a nice tight seal so there's no air coming out. No... OK. Time to short circuit an electric car. Press the button. LOUD SQUEAK Did you see them leads move? Over 4,000 amps. We have smoke. The short-circuit has made the batteries overheat, Triggering an escalating chain of chemical reactions which give off even more heat. It's called thermal runaway. Oh, come on! She's away, boys! Right... She's away now, mate. After a few minutes, the car approaches 650 degrees... BLEEP hell. ..and components explode. Bloody hell, she's going now. Guy, here on the right, is going to help the Fire Service test a new method of extinguishing car fires with a giant blanket. It's took a bit of dragging over, that blanket. Yeah, yeah. I had a bit of pressure on. By the looks of it, that's put it out. By the looks of it. It would normally be left like this for at least 24 hours. Underneath it's still hot enough to combust if presented with more oxygen. Yeah, we'll pull it off, erm... See what happens, see what happens. BLEEP! There it goes. This time, Guy gets to experience the conventional way of putting out a car fire. The only way to put that out is to get the temperature down, to stop the reaction taking place, so you need to smother it in water. The plumes of smoke contain hydrogen cyanide and mask which parts of the car are still on fire. GUY SHOUTS OUT Being covered in smoke, it's all right because that breathing apparatus is mint, you don't feel anything. She's sparking, lad, she's sparking. I weren't scared, I weren't scared. It takes six minutes to extinguish the fire... What do you think, Bob? We're pretty much there, Guy. ..and bring the temperature down. But despite being doused in 1,800 litres of water, the batteries continue to fizz and spit. Look at that, them batteries bubbling. That'll be alight again tonight. Right? Crackers. Although it may look like the fire is out, an exothermic reaction - one that gives out heat - continues in the batteries. They've been known to light up again two weeks after the fire. What's going to happen? Yeah, it's going to light up in the workshop or parked up next to another car in a breaker's yard somewhere, and take everything else with it. So, that's why the only way to deal with these properly is to dump 'em in a skip of water. It's a technique that's already being used in Germany, where rescue services are trialling watertight shipping containers. The experts at Mira conclude that electric cars are no more dangerous than petrol cars. They're just dangerous in a different way. Back at the workshop, the 50-year-old Beetle has been subjected to a thorough upgrade programme by Guy and the team. Wider tyres, bigger wings. Normally it takes years to perfect a record breaker, but with a limited budget, the team are restricted to fitting in work between other jobs. You still working on the lorries or not? Yeah, yeah. Never stopped, really, that. But with an EV, the biggest hot-rod gains can be made in just a few minutes. Today it's all about power. It's all about power. We've come to find it. When James Watt first converted a torque measurement into the concept of horsepower as a way of marketing his new steam engines, he had little idea that it would still be the benchmark used by every petrol head 250 years later. Horsepower and torque - what's the difference? You could soon make it sound dead complicated, but I sort of just use the simple terms, right? I just use the simple terms. The torque is how hard I'm pushing you. Like, I'm pushing the sound dog, how hard I'm shoving you. And the horsepower is how fast I'm doing it a minute. That's a thousand quid's worth of microphone, that! It's a thousand quid's worth of microphone! Can you see that? Just how fast those torque events are happening. In terms of the Beetle, torque is the force that will launch it off the line, and power is what will carry it to the finish. The team want as much of both as possible and have come to the rolling road of experienced supercar tuner Ricky Elder for help. Chris Hazell has also been brought in to modify the motor. By attaching a Wi-Fi router close to the Tesla internals, it's more akin to computer hacking than traditional engine tuning. All right, we're in. I'm just listening and learning. Right, let's see if we can hook some power, then. Ready? Yeah. We're good. Watch your fingers. The Beetle's throttle is floored. It spins its wheels at the equivalent of 120mph, while a live readout shows the forces being generated. 9,000 rpm motor speed. You are doing 647 Newton-metres of torque. Which for, something that ain't powered by rotten dinosaurs, that ain't... It's impressive. ..that ain't bad mate, that ain't bad. So that little thing is nearly making the same torque as a Â£100,000 pound Porsche. But you run out of revs. Give me more revs, I'll give you more power. OK. The tuning can commence. Let me just refresh this and I'll see if it's going to play ball. They start by telling the motor to use more electrical energy by increasing the amp limit. But it comes with a warning. I don't want to put it up at all, to be honest. But I know we can push it up, we've just never pushed it past 1,100. What, you've never done that before? So, you don't know if that would damage the invertor? We just push it and see what happens, at the end of the day. They also adjust a parameter called F slip, which controls the three magnetic fields that make the motor spin. It's the point in which you energise the magnets, right? So, if you've got two magnets on your table, and they're attracting, right, you want 'em in that sweet spot. So you get 'em too close, they're just going to snap together - you don't want that. You want 'em near enough apart so you've got the maximum pull, but you don't want 'em touching. So, that's what adjusting the F slip is, is just getting that distance right. The attracting magnets, he's just getting 'em close enough so they're just about pulling, but not touching. That's when you get your maximum power - in that window. So, the closer we are together, it'll pull the motor round faster. So, you just get to that point and it pulls the motor round faster, so, yeah, there's a sweet spot. There is an undeniable tension in the room as they prepare for the run. Nobody knows if the new settings could make the Beetle self destruct. Right, you ready? Yeah. The run is completed safely, and the result speaks for itself. Spinning the wheels on the dyna...! We ended up at, like, 670 millimetres of torque, which is, yeah, that's as much, if not more, than anyone has ever got out of those Tesla kits. She almost pulled the dyna axle. Literally going "rrr!" Some introduction to electric cars, eh! Eh? It's probably pulled the back of the cell closer to the car. No, we're still good. What was once a classic family car has been turned in to a tyre-shredding monster. The power of EVs is undoubted, but what continues to plague them is something Guy is going to test to the extreme. Moths are out. The moths are out. Britain's recharging infrastructure is constantly expanding, with around 600 new public points installed every month. Am I putting it the right way? Yeah. A bit of real-world testing. Here we are. Guy's going to test the latest capability... You see that? ..by filming a video diary... 2:58am. ..of an 1,100-mile round trip... The new Hyundai, they've give us this for a day or two. ..starting at his house near Grimsby. Going to see if I can get to John O'Groats and back in a day. That's the plan. So, just charged it up to 100%. They're saying it'll do the thick end of 300 miles to a tankful. Worked out I can fill up at about three different places on the way up there with fast chargers. So, we're going to give it a go. 550 miles to go. John O'Groats, here we come. Here we come. Well, I hope we can get to Gretna before we need to charge. Manufacturers point out that the rules governing how a car's range is advertised stipulate that an average of different speeds must be used. Constant motorway driving means Guy won't get near the manufacturer claim of 298 miles from a full charge. Quick update - 53 minutes and 49 miles into the journey and we've only got 69% of the battery left. It's not looking very promising! HE LAUGHS Look in the corner. What have we got? 17% battery left, which generally equates to 30 miles. And we've got 50 miles to get to our supercharger. So, hang on, we're 20 miles missing somewhere. Yeah... Yeah, we're in trouble. And so, 155 miles after setting off, Guy makes an unplanned pit stop in Penrith. Right, here we go. Let's see how easy this is. Right... The first charger he finds is in a supermarket car park. First, see if it works. It doesn't. Oh, BLEEP! Luckily, the charger across the road springs into action. Thank you. There we go, we're charging. After 15 minutes, and an update to his journey log, Guy has enough range to get to his original target of Gretna Green... Go on, where is it? Oh-ho-ho, I see it! ..and one of the latest breed of chargers, which are the fastest in the country. Yeah, so a fast charger will be 50 kilowatts, and then you can get a proper fast charger which'll be 100 kilowatts. Right... And then you can get these Ionity chargers, which are 350 kilowatts! But the faster the charge, the bigger the bill. BLEEP! Look at the money! Holy BLEEP! I thought it was going to be cheaper! 70p per kilowatt hour?! Holy BLEEP! Excuse my language. The electricity in a home costs around 15p a unit, charging out on the road is around 30p a unit. This is more than double. There she goes, listen to that. She's getting wound up. ELECTRIC WHIRRING Listen to it, can you hear that? But in theory, it will charge this car to 80% in 18 minutes. More than enough time for breakfast. We've had a scotch pie and a cup of tea. If I go out there and it's not at...60%, 70%, summat like that, I'm going to be disappointed. Here we go. Right, here's the moment of truth. BLEEP! I'm not joking. That's saying 34%, 56 minutes remaining. I am disappointed. A check on the Zap Map app suggests other users have experienced slow charging with this particular unit as well. There we go. In the end, charging takes one hour and costs Â£40. After 130 miles, Guy reaches a supercharger in Perth. And this time, the system works as it should. Moving on to slower A roads extends the range to more than 200 miles. And after a brief recharge in Wick... Hiya, mate, you all right? So, where you lot tripping to? Only to John O'Groats, in that electric thing. ..Guy makes it to John O'Groats 12 and a half hours after setting off. Can you drive an electric car to John O'Groats? Yes, you can. Is it a pain in the arse? Yes, it is. There she is. Right, let's go find some electric. The return trip was a similar story. The bloody charge station... doesn't work. A failed charge at John O'Groats left Guy in a very sticky situation. Now turn right. The whole 1,100-mile round trip took 27 hours. There she is. And half of the ten charge stops had issues. It cost Â£204 in electricity, and diesel would've cost around 140. Skin of the teeth, my friends. Skin of the teeth. On the basis of this trip, it would seem that electric cars and long journeys don't always mix. But what Guy's planned next will play to battery power's strengths. Guy Martin hopes the Volkswagen Beetle he's helped tune is going to set a new record for road-legal electric cars on a drag strip. Ahead of its final testing, he shows it off at Caffeine & Machine in Warwickshire. We've come here to do a bit of market research. It's a hang-out for petrol heads of every denomination... Ah, Ford Transit. ..and some of Britain's biggest car influencers. Go on, let's have a natter about this. What do people committed to internal combustion feel about battery power being the future of transport? You try and make an internal combustion engine in your own kitchen, you're not doing it, are you? It's dead simple. So, hi, my name's Becky Evans, I am 28 years old, I'm a content creator. So, my name is Khyzyl Saleem. Online, I'm known as The Kyza, and I'm a vehicle concept artist. Full 3D environment, everything here is... Oh, my God! Look at the side pipes! Hi, guys, I'm Shmee, hello. YouTube car guy, living the supercar dream, sharing my experiences of the automotive world through my social media platforms. Go on, Khyzyl, what you thinking, mate? It's pretty mega. Yeah? Yeah. You see. That's definitely not what you normally have back there. No, not 600 horsepower as well. Yeah. It's not very pretty to look at, is it? I'm sure...it does the fast thing, but she's... What? It's just a big square block! That's the battery, mate. I know. Guy shows these petrolheads exactly what battery power can do. OK, here we go. Wow! It's ridiculous! As soon as he's putting his foot down, just keeps pushing you back into your seat. Like, it's not gradual, it's like, bang! Khyzyl had never been in an electric car. Wow. It's insane. OK. Instant speed, it's just crazy. I love the engineering behind this. It's very quick, but, when are you gonna use that on the roads? We're gonna hopefully use it on a drag strip, but outside of that... Oh, well, then, in that case... Outside of that... ..you're, you're all set. If you want an electric car now, the market in terms of production models, there are very few sports cars or exciting cars for petrolheads. There are very few of these type of cars that will grab the heart-strings of somebody who loves what I love, and I think this is the future of that direction. But how will the influencers' old-fashioned petrol engines compare in a back-to-back drive? Yeah, she's pretty clean. I had the engine out not too long ago. Shall we wake it up? Go on. ENGINE PURRS Sounds the part, don't it? ENGINE GROWLS Looking forward to this. I loved the Porsche, cos it was sort of one concourse, teacups chucked in the back, it was mint. Gangster machine. I just love it, cos it was a usable classic. You all right? You're all right, that's the one. HE IMITATES ENGINE Cracks and bangs in gear changes and waste gates and dump valves, you know, all of that complication and mechanical noise. Mate, it is cool. I'm impressed. And she could wagon the beast. She could wagon it. It's an involved experience. With a real smile on our face. Just the sound... The sounds it makes. GUY HOOTS WITH LAUGHTER You're right. You're right, mate. When you unleash it... ENGINE ROARS That's great. Gets a little bit lively, doesn't it? There's no doubt in my mind whatsoever that internal combustion will live on. No doubt in my mind. The problem I have when I'm driving this car is that my cheekbones start to ache cos I'm always smiling so much. Because it's just the involvement of driving, it's the driving experience. That's what they want. THEY CHUCKLE But to drive from point A to point B, right, that could be done in your electric vehicle, you're not gonna offend anything, and you're not gonna create the CO2. When you wanna go out and actually enjoy your driving, then yeah, you wanna get the old dinosaur out the shed and go burn a bit of petrol and oil. Ohh! So, Guy, what do you think, electric, petrol? Petrol every day of the week. That's not a question, mate. It's not a question. Do you know what I mean? Petrol power may be more fun, but can it still keep up? Guy and engineer Richard are going to find out at the Beetle's first test day. Just, safety first. If worst comes to the worst and you end up on your head... Go on. ..just that there, that's your safety cut-off. Oh, yeah, I can see it. And away you go. All right, see you later. Cheers. Nothing encourages ultimate performance more than a competition. And what better than to race a 204 mph petrol supercar? LAUGHTER Richard's friend, a petrolhead who wants to be known only as Rob from Canada, has brought his McLaren 570S for a shot at the 50-year-old Volkswagen. It's a 3.8 litre V8 twin turbo-charged, you know, internal combustion engine, obviously. I know it's posh and I know it's fast. It's not just fast, it's BLOODY fast. So we're gonna have a race, try and put this job in to context, just to see how the Beetle shapes up against a well-proven hypercar. ENGINE PURRS I think it'll be tight. Fingers crossed. Ho-ho-ho! Oh, man, it's on like Donkey Kong. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I will say, "Three, two, one, go," and you both go on the G of the "go", so please stand by. Three, two, one, go. Go on! BLEEP! Come on, come on, come on, keep going! Go on, send it! Ho-ho-ho! Holy BLEEP! That's fast! Oh! That was... That was tight. That Beetle is so fast. All right, boss? Yeah. I kicked it, just. Wa-ay! The start is depressing, because I just see you tearing off. Making no noise. No noise, and then I'm, like, making all this noise and racket and stuff like that. As long as it's long enough, I can catch you, but, it was amazing. You know, if you can take a Beetle and make it THAT quick, the future of hot-rodding is definitely in safe hands. It's not just fast for a Beetle, it is fast full stop. Is it fast enough? Beating internal combustion seems easy, but can they beat the record? The day of Guy's record attempt has arrived. He's come to the home of British drag racing, Santa Pod in Northamptonshire. Conditions at this famous quarter mile strip are perfect. But Guy arrives to the worst possible news. "Jay Leno tries to break record in Tesla's new Model "S Plaid on Jay Leno's garage." That's a bit of the same as what we're doing, innit? Am I going to play the video? Ah, there we go. There we go. FROM VIDEO: Hey. Are you ready to go? 24 hours ago, NBC reported that the record Guy must beat is no longer 9.86 seconds. 9.247. Wow. He's done a 9.24? It is now the fastest production car you can buy, faster than any Ferrari. We are on the back foot, boys. Get the kettle going. The team hope to stack the odds back in their favour by doing everything they can to improve grip. And here, that means glue. Track prep is a very specific thing to quarter-mile drag racing. Oh, here they are, they're spraying glue on. See. You're not going to wheel spin as easy because your tyres are glued to the track. You smell that. Putting hairs on your chest, innit? Each tyre is fitted with a sensor so that their pressures can be monitored via an app, and engineer Brian Porteous has been invited to make sure the tyres are always in the optimal state. There actually starts to be a molecular interaction between the tyre rubber and the surface. So we need to keep our eye on that because if pressure goes up too far that reduces your contact patch. Scientific, isn't it? Right, I'm going to give me brain a rest. I'm going to get me overalls on. Is there a test after this? I'll go get me overalls on. That's a lot of science that. It's time to make the first run of the day. The tyres operate at their best between 60 and 80 degrees. Bit more, bit more. Hold it. So Guy sets about warming them up. That's got a bit of heat in them. Traction control on, yeah. 10.8. How did that look? Not bad. We're into the 10, so that's a 10.8 with a 122 terminal. So that's a good start that, mate. Cheers, boss. 10.8 seconds is the same quarter-mile time as the legendary Ferrari F40 supercar. Guy lines up for a second go in a Beetle that is powerful enough to rip up chunks of concrete. But is it quick enough to break a record? Go on. 10.6. Happy with that. 10.6, buddy. 10.6, at 123, that. So we're going in the right direction. Well done, mate. Grand job, thank you. Cheers, boss. The finish line speed of 123mph is actually faster than the original record they were trying to beat, which means it's the first half of the run where time is being lost through wheel spin. Felt right at my limit there, yeah. OK. Well, let's give it a little bit more then. Yeah. How's she looking, Brian? She's looking all right. Loving those burn-outs. Preparations get serious. We've got our eye in this morning. Right? I want to say this is the money shot. This is where we're going to go and do it. The sun's been on this track most of the day now. I mean that's probably going to be the quickest times this afternoon. So we'll see what happens, but, yeah, could do without this head wind though. Brian, the Michelin Man... Not the Michelin Man, it's just a man that works with Michelin, he didn't want to risk picking any pebbles up because there's slight pebbles sat in the rubber and that is going to slightly compromise the friction the tyre can give for an absolute run. So this is why we've swept all the track... Brian swept all the track, I didn't. But I would've done if he'd have asked, but he didn't. We was off having cup of tea for dinner, he was here sweeping the track. He means business. So there is nothing left to chance. If we don't do it, we aren't doing it. I'm looking forward to having a go. Come on, let's get them primed. Burn-outs only heat the surface of the tyre so a fresh set of rubber is being thoroughly warmed in electric blankets. Good luck, buddy. Thanks very much. To avoid contamination, they won't be fitted until the car has driven the short distance from pits... Just stop it there. ..to start line. There is nothing left to do but accelerate. That's a 10.78 that, so that's going the wrong way now. Even with all the tyre and track preparations, the car produces so much power its wheels still spin rather than grip. No matter what they try... ..no matter how much sweeping... ..no matter which lane... ..no matter how many software tweaks... ..no matter how many burn-outs... ..they can't extract any more speed from the Beetle. So you got a 10.9 there. So, whether or not you think you can go and give it a bit more beans on the start line or you think that's about as good as it's going to get? There's always room for another, isn't there, Come on, let's have another go. Go on, then, let's go one more time. The stiffening head wind may be good for clean energy production, but it's not good for a record attempt. Bad wind stops play. I'd say we're back to 11.1 again now. So, I think we'll call it a day. 10.6 this morning was the best run. So, well done, mate. We'll call it a day at 10.6. Yeah, well done, mate. Yeah, you've created some piece of kit, mate. Yeah. Hey, hey we didn't do what we set out to, boy, but we've had a lot of learning along the way, so, yeah. But I'm well impressed, mate. Good work. I dread to think what the R&D budget difference is between, like, you know, Elon Musk and little Moggy in Wales. Thousands versus tens of millions? I'm not that far away, you know. What's impressed me about electric vehicles is, dead easy to go fast. But not proper fast, but fast. You know what I'm saying. You know what I'm saying. But dead, dead easy. Should you buy an electric car tomorrow? Erm, yes and no. Yes, and no. Well, if you're never going any further than, for example, 50 mile from your house, then yes, an electric car is the way to go. Right? But if you go out once a week and do 100 mile, 200 mile, 300 mile, no, an electric car isn't because we haven't got the gubbins to keep you on the road sorted yet. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming but it's not there yet. I think we're just seeing a massive ramp up in development, right? I reckon give that another year, maybe two years, then that's the time to buy. Get stuck in, two years, electric cars will be the way. Subtitles by Red Bee Media
