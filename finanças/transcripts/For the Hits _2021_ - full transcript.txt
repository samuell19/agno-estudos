Hmm. Just be yourself. You'll be fine. Mhmm. [GARGLES] [COUGHS SHARPLY] [COUGHS] Bla la la la la la la la. Ca-ca That's it. [EXHALES NERVOUSLY] Hi, I'm Suzanne Winners today on Channel 12 News. We have none other than the infamous YouTube sensation George Jordan. Some of you may know him better as "The Crying Guy" or "The Do Nothing Guy" or even "Cold Foot". "Cold Foot"? George, in your own words, can you tell us what happened that night? A night the world may never forget. Ever. GEORGE: I uh, SUZANNE: Ever. Well, first off, the night you're talking about was last night. Are you avoiding the question, George? No, I'm just letting everyone know that it hasn't even been a week since this happened. What happened that night, George? Well, I was leaving the liquor store when I heard a horrible, shrill scream. SUZANNE: The victim GEORGE: The actor. It wasn't real. Hmm. Well, it looked pretty real to me, George. Why would anyone make light of such an atrocity? I don't know. For the hits? They said it was a social experiment. Well, the assailant in the video was African-American. Did this play a factor in your reaction? No, it's not like I hate black people. It it was a joke. I was going along with it. So you're saying you think rape is a joke? Do I think rape is a joke? No, I think it's an epidemic that's been plaguing the country for way too long. Supposing your story is true, what did you think of your acting performance? I think it was okay, but I could do better. Where were you going with that bottle of wine, George? GEORGE: Well I- SUZANNE: Do I have a drinking problem? Do I have a drinking problem? No! I was going to my girlfriends, for dinner, and I didn't want to show up empty handed. What's your girlfriend's name? Kim. But she has nothing to do with this. What did Kim say about you showing up without the wine and without your shoes? Well, she didn't say anything because I showed up in my shoes with the wine. Do you care about Kim? Yes! I love Kim. I would do anything for Kim. Well, what if it was Kim being attacked instead of this poor girl who is presumably dead? Would you have done anything differently then? I would've done a lot. But that's not the point. The whole thing was staged. It was fake. Why don't you people get that? If this was fake, why would you put your signature on a release form for a video that clearly makes you out to be a horrible person? Well, honestly, she asked for it, and I wasn't paying attention. And why hasn't anyone brought the fact that there was a guy filming it and why he didn't do anything? [SIGH] Wow. Well, there you have it. George Jordan says the video is fake, and he's got the shoes to prove it. When we come back, our very own James McAuliff has been undercover as a homeless man wandering the valley in search of the notorious, Van Nuys Vagrant Strangler. DIRECTOR: Cut. CREW: That's a cut. Okay. What the hell was that? Oh, nothing. You did great. Don't worry about it. Don't forget to pick up your complimentary Channel 12 news hat on the way out. [HITS VAPE] Do you think that's going to work? Tonight at five. When this airs, your life is going to change. Hmm. Thank you. Mhmm. Ahhhhh! Sweaty hands. Sweaty hands. Why your hands sweaty? It only happens when I get nervous. It's gross. Makeup! And that brings the death toll now to 14. Back to you, Suzanne. CREW: And cut. Hey, guys. I don't know how much longer I can do this. Man, I mean, I feel like any day now I'll be next. Yeah, I think that's uh, kind of the point buddy. Hey, but like I said, don't worry. We're going to be there for you. From the van. Good luck, buddy. [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYS] [VAN ENGINE STARTS] CREW: He's dead. [KIM HUMMING] Oh. Good to go. [humming] [FRIGHTENED EXHALE] What the fuck are you doing here? Let me explain. Explain what? I told you, I never wanted to see you again. There's nothing to explain here. I know, but. But just do me a favor and watch Channel 12 News tonight, please. The local news channel. Why would I watch that? Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to vacate the premises. Please. For me, it will explain everything. Sir. I will call the authorities. Hey, is everything okay over there? Yeah, it's fine, thanks. Can you just please watch the news at five? Please Uh, miss? Hi. Hi, um. Is this boy? Is he bothering you? GEORGE: No! KIM: Yes! Hey, aren't you cold foot? No! Who the fuck is this cold foot guy? No, I'm not George Jordon. Hmm. Well uh, whoever the fuck you are, I suggest you get the fuck out of here before something really bad happens to you. Okay? Okay. I'm leaving. You happy? Just please watch. Next. [CLEARS THROAT] Can I get a meatball parm, banana, peppers and ranch? Oh, shit. George, is that you? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm in a rush. Holy shit, it is you! Aye guys. George is here. It's not me! Of course it's you. You're the only person who orders that weird ass sandwich. WOMAN: Hey, it's the crying guy. Can I get a picture? No! You fucking may not! [CUSTOMERS FRENZY] Next. [DOOR CLICKS OPEN] Hey, Grandpa. Hello? Couldn't get your sandwich today. There's something going on at the Deli. But I hope you like a burger. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] Is that you? Yeah. Come on back. I can use a hand. GRANDPA GEORGE [V.O.]: in front of all of her neighbors. Who did nothing. Those sons of bitches. Should have been brought out back and put down. Pow! George, I can't get my Youtubes to work. Can you help me? And I got this damn rabbits eaten up all my tomatoes. George? George? Ah! I gotcha. [DOORBELL RINGS] [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYS] What do you think it could be? Quiet, it's about to start. Today on Channel 12 News, we have none other than the infamous YouTube sensation, George Jordan. Some of you may know him better as "The Crying Guy" or "The Do Nothing" guy or even "Cold Foot". George, in your own words, can you tell us what happened that night? Well, I was leaving the liquor store when I heard a horrible, shrill scream. SUZANNE: The victim? GEORGE: Yes. And you did nothing to help that poor woman in distress? Honestly, she asked for it. She asked for it. Are you insinuating that what the woman was wearing made her deserve the attack? I think rape is a joke. Fucking idiot. The assailant in the video was African-American. Did this play a factor in your reaction? Yes. I hate black people. Did he just fucking say that? What a fucking scumbag. I understand you were on your way to your girlfriend's house. Yes! What if the victim was your girlfriend? I could do better. Would you really be okay losing the woman you claim you love? It was a joke. I was going along with it. Are you fucking kidding me? George, why do you think men attack women? For the hits. They do it for the hits? SECRET FILMER: He was a really likable guy, man. Now nobody's gonna be friends with him. I have to say, George, I'm a little disturbed by what I'm hearing. Um. There are rumors on the comments board that you have connections to white supremacist groups. Tell me, what do you think about the Nazi party? I think it was okay. And the Holocaust. The whole thing was staged. It was fake. Why don't you people get that? George, I am disgusted even being in the same room with you. I think I smell whiskey on your breath. I have a drinking problem. SUZANNE: Oh, my God. Well, that doesn't surprise me. MOM: Oh honey, MOM: we need to do something. SUZANNE: I have one more question for you George. What do you think of North Korean dictator Kim Jong un? I love Kim. I would do anything for Kim. Well, there you have it, folks. Monsters do exist, and they are among us. George Jordan, May you burn in hell. When we come back, our very own James McAuliff SUZANNE: has been undercover as a homeless man DAD: He's fucked. wandering the valley in search of the notorious Van Nuys Vagrant Strangler.

And you being a um, son of a bitch and all. Image. What image? This is a shitty pizza place. You barely get 12 customers a month. I'm sorry, George. No, I'm not sorry. Goodbye. So that's how it's going to be. [NEWS PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND] [DAUNTING MUSIC PLAYS] [SIGHS] [MUSIC ENDS] What happened to you? I don't want to talk about it. How you holding up? Have you not seen the news? Apparently, I'm a Nazi and rape enthusiast now. Oh, and I just got fired. You hated that job anyways. Out of everything I just said, that's what you choose to address? To be honest, George. For a minute there, I was thinking about something else. [MACHINE GUNS FIRING] So, what's this about? [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] We're going to make a performance piece. Just like that lying piece of shit, Suzanne Winters. A video where I look like the hero and save the day. George. My whole life as a performance piece. Yeah. Everyone's going to be like, "Fuck yeah, George, get it done." GEORGE: This guy knows. Yeah. BRIAN: Cool. I like it. I like it a lot. How you plan on doing it? Well, you're going to steal the purse and I'm gonna stop you. Wait, I'm the bad guy? Well, no, you're going to be in the disguise. No one's going to know it's you. Okay. Uh. How are we going to get a girl? I mean, we don't know any, and no one likes you. Don't worry. I have a plan. You ready? [UPBEAT HEIST MUSIC] GEORGE [V.O.]: First we meet at the Rockies on Sepulveda. You know the good one by the Boom-Boom Room. Then we coast down Sepulveda, toward the oddball cabaret, and find our "actress." Pick her up, find the perfect location, shoot it, upload it and watch the hits roll in. [MUSIC ENDS] It's foolproof. I know, right? How'd you come up with it? I don't know. It just came to me when I was walking through the park. This your mom's idea? It's my mom's idea. Carol knows best. [HEIST MUSIC RETURNS] RANDOM COP: It is fun. BRIAN: I mean, that would... Brian are you fucking kidding me? [WHISTLES] You too. Why are you dressed like a cop? What do you mean? I thought you said I'm 'sposed to be like a hero or something. No. Me! I'm supposed to save her. What! Wait. I'm the bad guy? No, I'm not doing that. Who would agree to that? Just get in. I stopped at 7-Eleven and grabbed a mask. Unbutton that shirt and take off that stupid badge. It's not stupid, it's real. Hey, you. You're that guy, you're Cold Foot. Fuck off. Let's go hookin'. [MUSIC ENDS] Hey, boys. I'm Tiff Nomorales. Well hi, Tiff Nomorales. We're filmmakers, and we'd like to know if you want to be the star of our next performance piece. [QUIRKY MUSIC] Are you like, porn guys? BRIAN: No, no, no, no, no- TIFF: Oh, this is the Bang Hybrid. I've seen this. TIFF: Hey Mom, hey... BRIAN: No, no, no, no. It's. It's. It's nothing like that at all. Trust me, you can keep your, um... clothes on the entire time if you'd like. Okay. That's kinky. All right. It's $120 an hour. No dog. No poop. And no dairy. [MUSIC ENDS ABRUPTLY] Deal? No dairy? [MUSIC RETURNS] All right, guys. Almost ready. Let's do this thing! GEORGE: Wait. Stop. What is that behind you? Nothin'. C'mon, let's go. This is takin' forever. You're gonna have to buy another hour. All right, fine. Whatever. Are you guys set? BRIAN: Ready! TIFF: Set. And action! [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] What? No! Stop! Will someone please help, someone that's really cool and totally not chicken shit. Halt bad do-er. I'm George, and I'm here to stop you. Oh, no, not George Jordan. Not again. Whatever am I going to do now? Stop your evil ways, that's what. You're lucky. George Jordan gives second chances. Second chances. Now beat it. Yes, yes. I promise. I am going to change my evil ways. All thanks to George Jordan. Oh, George Jordan. You are my hero, and totally, like, not a little bitch or something. What can I say? I do what I can. [MUSIC ENDS] [MUSIC ENDS] Dude. I love it. Nobody can see this ever. How did we think this was a good idea? [UPBEAT MUSIC] SUZANNE: Oh, my God, It's perfect. Wh-what? Why? Who is this? What are you talking about, who is this? Where have you been? JAMES: I was on the street-- SUZANNE: This is George fucking Jordan. His fuck ups pay your salary. I see. W-wait a second. I just got a great idea. Um. How would you like a promotion? Are you joshing me? Because I-I would love a promotion. I mean, does this mean that I have to be homeless anymore? No, no, no. This works. I like this. Okay. Is there a raise involved? No. Your job is to follow George around and film everything he does. But what about the strangler? Oh fuck the strangler. If you ask me, he's doing us all a solid. You know what I'm saying? Don't touch me. Your job is George now. Okay. But I'm still homeless? SUZANNE: Yes. JAMES: Okay, can I at least go home? No. Here's his address. Now you go get him, tiger, and I have a lot of faith in you, okay? And get the fuck out of my office 'cause your smell is upsetting me. Okay. Thank you so much for this. I really appreciate-- Get. Out. [MUSIC ENDS] ROSALISA: The 405 is at a complete standstill, and the 101 has five accidents so get ready not to move. And as for the weather, hot and sweaty. That's Southern California, everybody. Back to you, Suzanne. I didn't understand a word she said. But thank you Rosalisa. Or should I say gracias? SUZANNE [ON TV]: Last night, a staged robbery was caught on tape behind a local convenience store. Interestingly, it turns out the whole thing was staged by none other than well-known local racist and womanizer, George Jordan. Yes. They paid me to be in that video. George Jordan is a really strange guy. Oh, husbands, if you're sick of your wives, come on down to Sepulveda. Ask for Tiff Nomorales. I'll do pretty much anything. Mostly clean. Well, you've heard it here straight from the horse's mouth. I'm Clint Benardi. Back to you, Suzanne. Oh no. [MUSIC ENDS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [UPBEAT MUSIC] GEORGE: You.

Wait, why would the cops be coming here? Take it you haven't seen the news yet? No, I just woke up. [NEWS INTRO ON TV] What are you doing? Why did you bring all that? Dude. I have a plan. SUZANNE [ON TV]: Ladies and gentlemen, the footage you are about to see is extremely disturbing. Our very own undercover reporter, James McAuliff, was about to reveal the true identity of the notorious Van Nuys Vagrant Strangler when none other than local pariah George Jordan had to intervene. Fuck you. Unfortunately, due to George's actions, James was unable to get a clear shot of the Strangler's face, leaving him still at large. Are George Jordan and the Strangler in cahoots? Has George been helping him all along? These are the questions that should be on everyone's mind. I'm Suzanne Winters with Channel 12 News. As a reminder for any tips that lead to the direct arrest of the Strangler, the reward is now a whopping $75,000. CREW MEMBER: And we're off air [DARK QUIRKY MUSIC] Hey, Suzanne, I need to talk to you. Wait, Suzanne, I need to talk to you. Hey! Suzanne? Yes! Yes! What was that? Oh, that was a slam dunk, James.

Unh...yessss...fagh! I'm sorry. What? [GIBBERISH]...What, what, what, what? Like what the fuck are you still doing in my office? Get the fuck out of here. 'Cause Winters is a comin'. That's right. And it's gonna be a cold one. [DARK QUIRKY MUSIC] Yeah! JAMES: You're fucking crazy. You know what, fuck it. SUZANNE: Yeah! I'm out, I quit. Ok, fine! Have it your way. Oh. Oh, Hey, Security, could you please escort Mr. McAuliff out of my office? He's having a hard time understanding his immediate resignation. Thank you. Suzanne. Give me the footage. I'm turning it into the police. Oh, are you talking about, you're talking about this? JAMES: Yes. SUZANNE: Oh, you want that? Yeah, that's what I want. Can I have that? Please? SUZANNE: Here ya go.

What do you guys want? You wanna kill us? 'Cause I'm totally fine with that now. No, no, I'm not. JAMES: Okay, guys, guys, hey, relax. BRIAN:--not speaking for the two of us.

[PEACEFUL MUSIC] JAMES: Suzanne Winters is awaiting trial for withholding evidence of the Van Nuys Vagrant Strangler's Identity. On top of numerous accounts of slander and assault, Miss Winters may be facing anywhere from 5 to 10 years in prison. In related news, the reward has been claimed for the apprehension of the Van Nuys Vagrant Strangler by none other than local hero George Jordan. After this commercial break, we're going to check in with George, just to see how he spent that reward money. All right, man. We're live in five here. Man, this is so crazy. You know, yesterday I was just an unpaid intern, living in my mom's basement. Now, I'm a full blown news man living in my mom's basement just 'til I get on my feet, though. JOHN: Times are tough.

And that's what also makes me a little bit nervous about adding all these little guys right here. It just looks like a really big bush. You got this, buddy. Yeah, they're here to see you. You're on top. You're George Jordan. [MUSIC ENDS] George Jordan. Woah little lady. I think you're a little mixed up here. This is the boys room.

GEORGE: Good JOHN: How's business? Pizza, flowers, weird mix. Yeah. Okay, we're uh, we're live in five, four, three Right now? Oh, thanks, Jimmy. I'm here with George Jordan, local celebrity and business owner. George. How in God's earth did you come up with this idea? Hey, John. Well, after everything that happened and getting all that money, I didn't know what to do with myself. I thought about running away. I even thought about donating all of it. And then it came to me. How can George Jordan contribute to his community? And that's when I thought of delicious pizza and flowers. [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] Speaking of flowers, my beautiful girlfriend Kim can explain everything, as she's the master-- Hey, asshole. Did you tell my transgender child they can't use the bathroom? N-n-n-no, no, no. I showed your little girl where the girl's room-- Agh! He identifies as a man. You privileged piece of shit. Young child, Did Mr. Jordan do something to you? He touched me and said I had to go to the little girl's room. He touched you. KID'S MOM: You touched him. KID'S MOM: You touched him? GRANDPA: No, no, no... I will kick your ass from here to Kansas, you piece of crap. Mr. Jordan, is this true? Are you transphobic, or do you have some sort of specific vendetta against this beautiful, gender-bending creature of God? No. Fuck me. Right? OLD LADY: Fuck you. Oh!
