[dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [eerie music] [Raven's Mom] Marcus, you're hurting me. [Marcus] Look what you made me do. Now I lay me down to sleep. [Marcus] How could you, how could you do this to me? Pray the Lord my soul to keep. [Raven's Mom] It didn't mean anything, okay? [Marcus] It didn't mean anything to you? If I die before I wake. [Marcus] You're going around town like the fuckin' cum guzzling whore you are. Pray the Lord my soul to take. [Marcus] Why do I even bother with you? [hand slapping] [Raven's Mom crying] When I got someone ripe for the picking. You're the only one that understands me. [Raven gasps] Oh, shit. You okay back there? Swallow your gum? Just a bad dream, I'll live. [Raven sniffling] [Kane sighs] [Kane] Are you sure? I think we should've taken a left back here. Are you questioning me? Don't you think I know where we're going? And you're not gonna find it on a map. [Skylar] Oh, God, I think I'm gonna be sick. - Are you okay? - Ah, hell no, not in the car. Don't even go there. Nice, man, way to ease the situation. [Kane] Make it snappy, toots. [Kane snapping] Nevermind him. Come on, darling, I got you. [Skylar panting] Easy, easy now. [Skylar crying] [light dramatic music] - [Raven sighs] - Just when I thought today couldn't get anymore interesting. [Kane] Hm, guess you're not looking forward to final jeopardy. You ain't seen nothing yet. [Skylar coughing] [Skylar panting] Oh, thanks. [Skylar coughing] - Let me help you. - No, I got it. I don't know why anyone would wanna be pregnant. Being pregnant sucks. [Skylar sighs] Pregnancy is the beauty of bringing life into the world. - [Skylar scoffs] - Yeah, at my own expense. Why would anyone wanna do this twice? Love, procreation, failure to withdrawal. Yeah, everyone thinks they're a Quick Draw McGraw. A lot of hair triggers out there. [light dramatic music] As soon as ole' preggo gets back, we can find ourselves a place to lay low. Off the grid. So, did we did kidnap a doctor or midwife I didn't know about? Get some hot water, towels, that whole heavy breathing shit they do. I saw it on TV, it can't be that hard. Clearly you got this. Thank you for that vote of confidence. Fuck. [fly buzzing] I wanted to steal some smokes while we were in the store. Is this one yours? Help yourself. Oh, I always do. [Anya] Can I have one? No. [birds chirping] [car door slamming] [gravel crunching] [lighter clicking] [light dramatic music] [Kane sniffing] I smell bacon. You guys stay calm, we got some heat. Let me do the talking. Looks like another hair trigger situation, wouldn't you say? Car trouble? Oh, no, officer. One of the girls wasn't feeling too good, so I didn't want her to ralph in old Betsy here. She's a beaut. - Thanks. - I hear ya. You know, that smell never really goes away. No, not at all. [leaves crunching] It's about time Woo, Walley World here we come. Put your hands up and nobody move. Whoa, whoa. Nobody make any false moves. We're all good, we're all good. [Dispatch] All units, all units, multiple causalities at Will's Pump-N-Go. Available deputies in the area please respond. Shooter could still be around, so proceed with caution. Mancini out here in Sewers Row with possible suspects. Send backup. [gunshot banging] - [Anya gasping] - Oh, my God. - Nice shootin', Tex. - Oh, my God. [Skylar panting] Are you hit? [Kane] You almost took my fuckin' shoulder off. [Zoe] We gonna do something with this mess? No, but I got ya a gift. Oh, thank you. [car door slamming] And here, wipe the clerk off your face. That's probably what gave us away. [car engine rumbling] [Kane] Let's go have a baby. Oh, God. [light dramatic music] [gravel crunching] [birds chirping] [bees buzzing] [keys jingling] [car door slamming] [cigarette sizzling] [horse neighing] [crow cawing] I'm gonna go check this place out. Watch your head. [Skylar groaning] I'm sorry. [Zoe] Come, I have a plan. Woo. Yes, club paradise. Good pickin', man. It's better than a prison cell, princess. Make yourself useful. Bring the stuff in. [owl hooting] Raven get the bags, Raven do this, Raven do that. Why don't you fuckin' do something for yourself. God, fuck, right? [light dramatic music] Here's Johnny. Hm, I've fucked in worse. Ease up, will you? - [Skylar sighs] - Have a seat. You've got to be kidding me. Funny thing about Zoe's sense of humor, she ain't got one. [Skylar sighs] [suspenseful music] [zipper buzzing] Not quite the way I remember it. Hm. [handcuffs clicking] It's not exactly Fort Knox, but it will have to do. [handcuffs clinking] Comfy, hm? I'm gonna grab some stuff. Hang tight. I'll be on guard. [Kane groaning] Come on, where is it? [suspenseful music] No. [Anya sighs] [bag thudding] [Anya panting] [door creaking] [door slamming] Are you blind? Get that bitch! Aw, fuck! [dramatic music] Sounds like your little friend gave us the slip. Hopefully the little princess will be able to catch her without complication. A man can dream, hm? Check the perimeter. [Kane sighs] You're gonna need these. See if you can find that old generator and get it working. We need lights and water. All right. [light dramatic music] Everything's gonna be okay. Trust me. [dramatic music] [Anya sighs] [leaves crunching] Oh, this bitch. [leaves crunching] [Anya sighs] Ah, seriously? Today of all days. Oh, God. [Anya panting] Shit, where'd she go? [Raven sighs] [light music] - Hey. - Allow me. [lighter clicking] Thanks. [dramatic music] [Anya panting] [leaves crunching] I thought you were just passing through? Uh, I was. I mean I still am, but I'm glad I ran into you 'cause I wanted to let you know... - Hey, Anya. - Uh, hey. [Raven] Uh, this your girlfriend? No, no, no, this is my best friend. And I thought I knew all of yours. - Raven. - Hi. [dramatic music] [leaves crunching] You must be Skylar. Yeah and you must be the mystery girl from the bar? Mystery, huh? Not anymore, huh? Well, it's nice to put a face to the story. It's nice to put one to yours as well. [dramatic music] [leaves crunching] So, you're like super pregnant. Yeah, I feel like a beached whale. Hey, hey, you're not that big. Look, listen, turn the side then wait, bitches appear. - Just like this. - Now, Anya, what'd I tell you about getting with a liar? Flatterer maybe, but liar, never. [dramatic music] [Anya panting] Okay, Anya. [Anya sighs] So, who's the little one in there? Um, this would be Sabine. You know, I actually really like that name. I suggested that you know. I knew there was a reason I had my eye on you. [dramatic music] [leaves crunching] Okay, listen, so I'm like really pregnant and hormonal, I don't wanna see her get hurt, so you better not hurt her. You're good, mama, I promise. [dramatic music] [Anya panting] So, I'm gonna grab something to eat. I'll catch you inside. All right. She means well. Yeah. [dramatic music] That poor girl. Well, um, hey, I'm gonna see what my folks are doing. I gotta know what's taking them so fucking long. Okay, I'll wait. [Raven] Oh, my God, I'm so fucked. Oh, my God, I'm so fucked. They are going to kill me. No, you're not. You like chili dogs? I do, I could eat. [Anya sighs] [leaves crunching] Oh, shit. Is that us on TV? Watch out! [gunshot banging] You could've gotten away. Come with me. [birds chirping] Or was everything you said a lie? None of it was a lie. But this wasn't supposed to happen. [leaves crunching] Bitches. One of these days, Raven. Bam, zoom. [branches crunching] [suspenseful music] Who's out here? Come on out. Hands up. - You alone? - Yeah. - What's your name? - Max. You packing, Max? [Max] Just this. All right, put it on the ground. Staying at the house? Look, I'm just an old vet. I was a crashing in the house, I didn't think anybody lived there. I'll just get my shit and go. A vet, huh? Yeah. What war? 'Nam. My daddy was in 'Nam. Great. Can I buy you a drink? Sure. Looks like the one we had in 'Nam. It was my daddy's. That saved my ass before. - Yeah? - Literally. The inside saved mine. [both chuckling] [light dramatic music] I was about your age when my dad, your grandad, sat me down and had a drink with me. [Kane coughing] Easy. Yeah, I about tossed my cookies the first time too. [Kane coughing] Whoa, yeah. You got all of these for being a hero? Some might disagree. Well, I wanna be just like you when I grow up. Better than me. Better. [light dramatic music] [lighter clicking] [Kane sighs] She only does that when she's coming up with some type of plan and honestly, this one sounds like a doozy. But you know, I hope your friend didn't cause any real problems with that little stunt of hers. Ah, what the hell. You're pretty good at improv. [leaves crunching] You were so close, Anya. Why? I just, I couldn't leave Sky like that. And I couldn't leave, hm. [Raven groaning] - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah it's this, the same old story about the bitch who ate the apple. You know, I'm still the same Raven you met before. I'm trying to believe that. All I can do is say I'm gonna show it to you. You know what, I'm gonna prove it to you. Come on. [birds chirping] Be a shame if a hair was harmed on her pretty little head. At least by Raven anyway. [Skylar spitting] [Kane chuckling] You know I'd never harm a pregnant lady, but you ain't always gonna have that security blanket. [Kane growling] [dramatic music] [birds chirping] [light dramatic music] [branch cracking] [Anya sighs] [Zoe sighs] [door latch clicking] Well, look what the cat dragged in. Where do you want her? [Zoe] End of the hall. You all right? She beat you up? It's nothing. What? [Anya gasps] Right. Well, this time don't fuck it up. Come on, let's go. Turn. Hey, took you long enough. Now, why don't you make like a tree and get the fuck outta here. It's leave, Biff. [Kane sighs] [fingers snapping] Whatever. What we have here is a failure to communicate. [light dramatic music] [thudding] The one house, they had to pick the one house that had fucking, crack heads really don't have periods do they? This is, maybe I should start doin' fuckin' drugs. God dammit. It's okay, it's okay, just fuck it, just fucking God fucking dammit. There's no toilet paper, I don't even know. And apparently crack heads don't wipe their ass either. [Raven sighs] [urine splashing] [Raven sighs] [Raven burps] Oh, man, the stress just makes it worse. It's not like the bitch cares. She doesn't care, right? [light dramatic music] [Kane sighs] [Kane sniffling] You know I'm a big movie buff, right? My daddy used to take me all the time to see different genres, showcasing the best and the worst that we as a species are capable of. The best stories always ring true because of the little details. Single moments strung together like a, like pearls. [belt snapping] [suspenseful music] [Kane sighs] I love how art imitates life and if you look carefully, the pendulum swings the other way. Life pays homage. [dramatic music] "Misery" is a masterpiece written by Stephen King. He talks about a novelist who was held captive by a crazed fan. Well, one day he decided he wanted to escape. Guess what? She didn't take too kindly to that. [Kane sighs] So much so, that she wanted to do preventive measures to make sure he didn't get very far again. There's an old technique they used to use to keep workers in line. It's called hobbling. [Kane sighs] Hm. In case you missed the movie, let me give you a little recap. You take the piece of wood like so, you put it between the ankles like so. [belt buckle clanking] You find a blunt object. Um, oh. [suspenseful music] This'll do just nicely. Then you step up and you be the ball. [Skylar screaming] [mallet thudding] [Skylar gasping] [Zoe] Is everything okay? Tapa tapa. Are you trying to induce labor, dummy? [Kane sighs] [Skylar panting] And McFly, in the book she cut off the foot, not that I want you to. It ain't no big shake, say that, wait, did you just McFly me? I'm the one that does the movie quotes around here. That's my thing. Making that farfetched pie in the sky, that's your thing. Um, guys, Houston, we have a problem. Oh, and you're gonna fuck up that line. The problem. [Skylar panting] Her inhaler, it's, it's, it's in her purse. What, are you deaf? [Skylar panting] Aha. What, why? Breathe slowly. - [Skylar panting] - Is she gonna be okay? [dramatic music] It's empty. It must be at the apartment. [Zoe] Take that one with you and no funny business. You've got enough notches. Why do you have to take her with you? Oh, chop, chop, buttercup. [bed frame clanking] Take the one that needs the fuckin' inhaler. Move that little ass of yours. Breathe. Won't this just be lovely. Me and Miss Daisy out for a drive. Miss who? Fuckin' millennials are so clueless. [car door slamming] [birds chirping] Fuck you, grandpa. [Skylar panting] I gotta pee. [Skylar panting] Do you think you can keep a lookout without notifying the press of our whereabouts? [Raven] Okay, whatever. [light dramatic music] [Skylar groaning] Privacy is earned, darlin'. [Skylar scoffs] [Skylar sighs] [urine splashing] I can't wait to get this thing out of me. This thing? [Skylar sighs] Whatever, you wouldn't understand. Well, you are past your due date. What's her name? I still haven't decided yet. What happened to the sperm donor? [toilet flushing] [Skylar] Why do you care? [Zoe] My natural maternal instinct. [Skylar sighs] I don't feel good. [Zoe] How about some water for the baby? [crows cawing] Oh, my God, everything is going so fast. Everything is spiraling out of control. Oh, my God, they're gonna say this is all my fault, and I can't believe this because it's not my fault. It wasn't even my idea to begin with. Oh, my God, I fuck everything up. Why, goddammit, why did I even leave my home? I mean, because it wasn't my home. I guess this is my home now, with these two punchlines of saviors that I could fucking ask for. I can't even, oh, my mother was so right. I should've just stayed home and let her hate me. Oh, why did I have to drag myself into this? Oh, my God, there are nothing but players in my house of cards and it's constantly falling, there's some kind of breeze. I can't, oh, I can't breathe. Oh, I can't breathe. Oh, I need to wait, I need to slow down. Oh, I can't. Oh, I can't. Okay, I just need to breathe. You got this Raven. You got this, you got this, you can do this. [Raven sighs] [lighter clicking] [flies buzzing] Oh, God, I can't breathe. Oh, my God, I can't even function. I can't do this, I can't do that, I can't do anything right. Why did I have to alert us? I should have known we were gonna be on the news. I should have known this was all gonna get us caught. And these poor girls, they just wondered up. Why did it have to be them? She's actually a really nice girl. I, oh, my God, my whole world is tumbling down inside of my head. Everything is going wrong. They're gonna blame me for all of this. God, I am such a fuck up, I am such a shit. I can't even believe that I did this. I can't, oh, God, everything inside of me is like blowing up at one time. I can't even hear myself talk. I can't, I can't. God dammit, fuck! [boot thudding] [crow cawing] [Max] Yeah, hey! Yeah, hey! Oh, god dammit, what did they get us into now? Yeah, hey, hey, yeah, hey! Untie, [coughing]. Untie me! Come here! Hey! There went my house of cards. [Max] Come here, come here! Hey! [door creaking] [handcuffs clicking] Contrary to what you may think, I'm not some monster. I'm someone with needs, just like you. Oh, yeah, we're so much alike. You'd be surprised how easily the shoe could fall on the other foot given the right push. [light dramatic music] And then I could feel their presence. Hey, that's fucking private. Strong hands clamp my wrist, pinning them against me. Hot breath beating down my neck. Flesh against flesh. Exploring, invading, taking me wherever she... [phone ringing] Fuck! [dramatic music] Kane's House of Love. Yeah, we got it. [Anya sighs] I always have a plan. [Zoe sighs] I may never have a life again. [Zoe scoffs] You don't deserve to be a mother. You know, this fuckin' house. Had to pick the one house in the fuckin' crack neighborhood. [Raven sighs] You know, you sure do bitch about her a lot. Why are you feeding her? [Zoe] She's gotta eat. You know, it's nice to see somebody else who's freaking out about this as much as I am. The devil is in the details. I bet he does know your plan. I'm just winging it like McCartney. I always more partial to John. Are you sure you wanna feed her outta that? What doesn't kill her makes her stronger. Yeah, I guess Paul did say that. You know, live and let die. My mom was always really partial to Ringo. She didn't care for me much. I guess that's why sometimes I look at you like the mother I never had. Wait, did you say sometimes? I think it's time you return to your post, little girl. Wait, wait, wait, wait, fuck boy fresh is out there with Anya doing God knows what, God knows fucking where, and I have to sit here and be the fucking babysitter? Why didn't you just send me? You will be what I need you to be. Fuck this, I'm outta here. [Zoe clearing throat] And how long are you gonna hold that over my head? [dramatic music] [fist knocking] What the hell is it? Oh, I'll be dipped in shit. Look who it is. Your whore ass mommy ain't here if that's who you're looking for. [Raven] No, I came for you. Oh, are we about to get into the kinky shit? [Raven] No, but for real, I came to see you. [Marcus groaning] - [Kane chuckling] - You getting this? Mm hm. [Marcus groaning] I feel like a proud papa. [Kane chuckling] [Marcus groaning] Looks like we both got a souvenir. Yeah, well he certainly did take one from me, didn't he? [light dramatic music] [silverware clanking] Hey, so, um, I hope you like tomato. Out of that? Are you kidding me? Zoe doesn't kid. And so I've heard. [dog barking] [door creaking] Come on. Hey, uh, Anya. You uh, you need a hand? I think we got it covered, Spicoli. Yeah, Cam, but thanks anyway. Where's fertile myrtle? It's not like she's been kidnapped or anything. [Kane chuckling] She's just camping out - with the 'rents. - Yeah. One last time before she pops. Uncle Jim just flew in. - Yep. - Didn't wanna miss it. Sure don't. Well, uh, if you get tired of moving all that stuff... Ah, she won't. Wait, you didn't even... I don't need to. Listen, I was young once. Why don't you take your game right on to somebody else. Unless you wanna see me angry. - Just trust me... - Let me guess, Ferrigno. I wouldn't like it? Good reference though. Kidnapping, what the fuck? [dogs barking] [muffled whispering] [Zoe sighs] God, where'd they go, BFE? [door creaking] [bag thudding] Any static? Nope, in and out. [Kane sighs] [beer can clicking] Well, intermission's over. It's showtime. I got this. [Kane chuckling] What's got her panties in a wad? Probably you putting your dick in places it doesn't belong. - [Kane sighs] - Mm. [light dramatic music] You know, this day started off perfectly fine, out on the open road, wind in my hair and off the grid. Then you had to go and make us. Shoulda let that clerk smoke your ass. Don't you wish you ran things around here? [Kane chuckling] I keep things running. [Raven scoffs] [Skylar sighs] [inhaler hissing] [Zoe] That dream was some whopper. You okay? I'm fine. I'm just concerned. What? You think just 'cause we shared a moment, we're girlfriends? I am your best friend right now. Do not test me. [bed creaking] Oh, yes, goddamn, it's slightly comfortable. Oh, my ass hurts. Everything hurts. [lighter clicking] Oh, my life, how did I get here? Oh, that's right I had fantastic sex that one night and never mind. What the fuck? - I literally just... - Shift change. [Raven sighs] Yes, my Fuhrer. Watch it, bitch, my mother was Jewish. And it's fuhrer. ♪ Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to slave I go ♪ Oh and by the way if you're looking for the eighth dwarf, Dumbass, I think I saw him crawl into the garage. [birds chirping] Look, I don't know what this is. I don't know what you're running from. I mean, but you don't have to worry about me. I'm not gonna drop a dime. I don't know nothing, I didn't see nothing. My ugly face has already been all over the rags, many a dime been dropped. [Max sighs] [door creaking] [birds chirping] [wind chimes chiming] [door creaking] [door slamming] [birds chirping] [Zoe] Boo! Holy shit, woman. Why are you so jumpy? I just thought I was alone out here. [Zoe] Well, you can be. No, I was just havin' a smoke. Are you having second thoughts? No. You want a baby, we'll take that baby. Whoa, don't put all this on me. I know, but you're not gonna be a single mother. Looks like I'm not the one having second thoughts. [lighter clicking] I kinda like this plan you got going on here. I know you wish it was under better circumstances, but hell might freeze over before the stars align. What, no witty movie quotes? That means I'm serious. Listen, you will make the best mother. Now, it can't get any worse than what we've already seen. Oh, thank you. [lips smacking] And I will gladly drive off any cliff with you. We would probably drive each other crazy long before then. [Kane chuckling] We can always hang it up and give our child a normal life. I always did want a puppy. [both laughing] What's normal anyways? Boring and definitely not us. No, listen, I'm with you wherever, whenever, you know that. I know. We're burning daylight. Oh, why don't you do a supply run. I was just out! Well, get some stuff for the baby. We've already go the baby stuff. Uh, we need diapers and formula. She's got tits. Even tits need a rest! [light dramatic music] Tits need a rest, too! It's not gonna suck those nipples off. [Kane groans] [car door slamming] [Kane sighs] At least she fucks like a banshee. [car engine rumbling] [inhaler hissing] [Skylar panting] You really should try to calm down. It's not good for the baby. Yeah, neither was running off like that. Suppose they decided to punish me. I was going for help. I don't think they're after us anyway. I mean, not really. What do you mean? [Anya sighs] Well, Kane got a little handsy earlier. What? [Anya hushes] It's okay, don't worry about it. I'm fine, just keep your eyes open, okay? It'll be okay. I'm gonna be okay. Listen, back at the house I grabbed my... Hey, so I managed to find some food. I know it's kinda like really shitty and dirty around here, but I found a paper towel. Any takers? You always get shit detail. Your parents must really like you. [Raven sighs] Well, let's get one thing straight, baby. These are not my parents. [light dramatic music] [handcuff rattling] If you're about to go into labor, I need you to keep that shit in 'cause if not, I'm outta here. I don't want that image burned into my head. Relax, it's just these cuffs. Well, you know, Zoe wants what Zoe wants, and she said we can't have you getting loose. She's like a million months pregnant, seriously? I'm also not really into bondage, so it wasn't my call. Where are they taking us? No where. [Skylar chuckling] She wants my baby. Wait, did she tell you that? [phone ringing] Thrill me. No, not toddlers. Formula for infants, newborn diapers and baby powder. Well, I'm not a parent either and yet I know this stuff. You quote movies in your sleep. Do I need to film myself saying all of this for you to remember it? See you next Tue, oh, say that again and Tuesday is gone. [light dramatic music] Why would you stay with these psychos if you didn't have to? [Raven sighs] 'Cause these psychos, well, I mean, I guess they saved my life. [Anya sighs] [light dramatic music] It's quite the gift you have there. Thanks. It's nice to feel appreciated. I used to draw a little. Oh, yeah? Cut your ear off, then we can talk. [Skylar scoffs] You still have yours. - [Raven sighs] - Yeah, but you have no idea the shit I've lost. You're absolutely right, we don't. You know, this pad and this pencil, when I put it to it it's like everything goes away; time, space, the emptiness, my thread of life that's holding me together. It all finds itself in my happy place. Sounds like me and my relationship with Mary Jane. No judgements, listens to your problems, the sweet aroma. You know, you make her sound almost as intoxicating as you are. [light dramatic music] [Anya sighs] Listen, I lifted my phone from the house. Don't tell her. She'll try to take it. [light dramatic music] [Zoe] Going somewhere? Um, where does it look like? [Zoe] Make it quick. Do you mind? I don't, but she does. Come on, a little credit. I didn't have to give up earlier. [Raven] All right, I guess I trust you. [Raven sighs] [Zoe] I can hear you. I know you can. [pills rattling] Think of the baby. That's a good girl. [light dramatic music] No, God, fuck. I need some fucking signal. Come on. [Anya sighs] Oh, my God, no. Yeah, there's no fucking signal. [Anya sighs] What's this crazy bitch got me into? Serious right now? [Zoe] What was that? Nothing, Mom. [Zoe] All of this must be so exciting. Hardly. Try agonizing. A little life inside of you. Unsure if you have that motherly instinct to care for that life, excited to face that challenge. I know Raven's not yours. So, what happened to your baby? Life happened. And sometimes life is cruel. [Anya panting] Just breathe. [deeply breathing] You're okay. Okay. [light dramatic music] I can't believe I got her dragged into this. It's fucking nuts. [door handle rattling] Oh, shit. See, you can trust me. Okay. What's? St. Jude. Yeah, I guess I am kind of a lost soul, ain't I? So was I. I was broken even though I'm not really just like the rest of my family, this necklace gave me comfort in those dark times. Now, it can give me comfort. [lips smacking] [light dramatic music] [light moaning] Well, well, well. Every teenage boy's wet dream. And those tend to get messy. What the fuck is happening? [handcuff rattling] Tie up your girlfriend. What, this wasn't part of the fucking plan! Plans change. [Raven sighs] Okay, it's gonna be okay. Come on, it's all right. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, this was, this really wasn't part of the plan, babe. [Anya] What's she gonna do to me? I don't know, babe, I really don't. I'm not gonna let her hurt you. At least I'm gonna try. I really am. What's going on? This is the price of defiance. What? No. What's happening. - You'll see. - What? They could make a cute couple under different circumstances. But we're here now and we're gonna make the best of it. I wanna throw you a shower. And we're gonna play ourselves a game. 50/50 odds. Heads or tails. [Anya spits] - [Anya sighs] - Why? Why did you do that? [suspenseful music] [Anya groaning] [Anya crying] [switch blade clanking] [Skylar crying] Oh, my God! [Anya crying] [Skylar crying] [Anya whimpering] Now shut the fuck up. [Raven panting] You are a fuckin' psycho. [Skylar gasping] [Zoe] You call it. [Skylar crying] It's okay, we'll cooperate. Please, you don't have to do this. She did this. Heads or tails? Um, uh, uh, heads. [light dramatic music] Fuck. Don't touch her. Don't touch her! So pretty. Come on, don't be shy. [shirt ripping] [Anya crying] She certainly is to die for. At least let her keep her dignity, you crazy bitch. Keep talkin'. - Punch her. - What? No. Did you think your indiscretions would go unpunished? It won't happen again. Punch her, hard. And none of that girly crap. Don't touch her. Punch her. [Anya crying] [Skylar cryihng] [fist thudding] [Skylar crying] That's better. Now let's see what you're made of. [Skylar panting] Heads or tails? [Skylar crying] Tails. Punch her again. Please don't make me hurt her. Punch her again. [Skylar crying] Please don't make me. Punch her. [fist thudding] [Raven whimpering] It's a shame. Such a pretty face. [Anya crying] I think you've made your point. My point? My point? And what pray tell would that be? You're in charge. It's okay. Look how scared she is. How about a little kiss to help her relax? Are you crazy? Did I stutter? [Skylar crying] [suspenseful music] Don't. [Skylar panting] [knife thudding] Oh, no! [Anya coughing] - [Raven gasping] - What the fuck? [blood squirting] [Anya coughing] [door slamming] [Raven gagging] - [Anya gagging] - I can't breathe. [Anya groaning] - [Skylar panting] - Oh, God. Ah, the baby. Oh, my God. Oh, shit. - Okay wait, okay. - No, no. It's okay, it's okay. Goddammit! [bed frame thudding] [Raven sighs] She's a fucking monster. - Can you help me? - Breathe. Breathe, it's okay. I don't know what to do. [Skylar panting] Just breathe, it's okay, it's okay. Calm down, calm down. [Skylar crying] It's okay. [light dramatic music] - [light switch clicks] - Mornin' Zoe. You at least catch the name of the boy this time? Wasn't Johnny, Jim or Jack, that's for sure. Look at you on your high horse judging me. You little whore. When I was your age we respected our elders. Girls didn't go around getting knocked up by some Johnny come easy. Easy? You make it sound like I asked for that monster to rip me apart and plant his seed. You sure do seem intent on popping a little pup out. I'll tell you what, this child is gonna be beautiful and loved. Probably some halfbreed. It ain't gonna be loved by me. - Won't be... - Ain't gonna be loved by me. Well neither was I! [elbow thudding] [Zoe groaning] [Zoe crying] [body thudding] [Ben] No, baby, no! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What did you do? All right, daddy's home. Where's the crackerjacks? [Kane sighs] I got everything here from a diddly eyed joe to a damned if I know. [Zoe] Any complications? No, just some bitch with coupons haggling for about 20 minutes. Everything went disco. Raven was getting weak in the knees for her, so I had to put an end to it. [light dramatic music] Guess we cut old preggo loose once her tits serve their purpose. What about the other one? [Zoe chuckling] Her tits have caused us enough trouble. [shovel scraping] [Raven] Can't even bury her in a good place. [Raven groaning] [dirt thudding] [shovel scraping] [dirt thudding] It's not what you deserve. We could've run away. [Raven groaning] We could've run away. [Raven sniffling] [Raven sighs] [lighter clicking] You know, I let you down. I'm not gonna let her down. We could've been everything. And now we're nothing. [Raven chuckling] I knew I shoulda never said hello to you. And I knew I never shoulda let you hold my hand. I shoulda walked away. [Raven crying] I should've pretended like I didn't know you. I didn't even know your last name. [Raven sniffling] I never was really good at goodbyes. I didn't even say goodbye to my mom. I just left, like I tried to do with you. [Raven sniffling] But uh, looks like you left first. I'm sorry. I'm not gonna let her down. Sadine's gonna have a nice life. I promise. [somber music] [light dramatic music] [Zoe] So pretty. Red is a good color on you. I'm done playing your twisted games. I do not play games. Took you long enough. Did you dig two graves? Sadly, no. [Zoe] Clean your girlfriend off of her. [Raven sighs] Ah, fuckin' cunt. Two things in this world that I don't break, my balls and my word for nobody. [Kane chuckling] Just do as I ask, don't give me no trouble, you'll be whistling Dixie in no time. You know, me and unit were on patrol once and we come across this village. And then I see this young girl. She might have been maybe 12, 13 at most. And we see these savages bearing down on here. They were ripping her apart. And then she was giving these agonizing screams and... We killed every one of those bastards. Every single one of them. But it was too late. She, uh, she bled out in my arms. And there isn't a night that doesn't goes by that those screams don't haunt me. Kinda like the ones I heard tonight. She wasn't whistling Dixie, you know. Listen, you don't give me no trouble, everything will be right as rain. [door creaking] There you are. No matter where you go, there you are. I thought maybe Raven had gotten tired of your crap and put you in the ground too. You know good and well that bitch would leave me out there and have me draw flies. Yeah. - I would not do that though. - Hm. I got way too much respect for the flies. Your bitter ass would probably kill them and mess up the food chain. You know what they say? Kill a butterfly, there's a tsunami somewhere. The butterfly lives, you know. Not today and there's a shit storm a-brewing. More than you know. [dramatic music] [door thudding] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [necklace jingling] [Raven] You keep that. What the hell did they save you from that's worth all this? It's complicated. Bullshit it is. Yeah, well, you see my mom, she was a grade A cum guzzler, and uh, she didn't care where she got it from or who, and uh, one of them decided that he couldn't keep his eyes or his hands off me and instead of doing the right thing, she kicked me out. So, then I thumbed it from state to state and almost starved to death. [light dramatic music] [wrapper rustling] Hey, bright eyes, you didn't pay for those. I'm sorry, I'm really hungry and I haven't - eaten for days but I... - All right, up, up, up, up. [Raven] Stop it, I'll return it, okay? I'll pay for it! That doesn't work, you can't, - isn't this a little excessive? - Spread 'em. - Maybe just a little bit. - Excessive. But I gotta make sure that you're not carrying. - What in your secret? - Come on. This girl's got some balls. - Don't do anything. - Seriously, relax. This could come in handy. - Get the fuck off of me. - Ow! Fuckin' kidding me. You think this is a fucking game? [gunshot banging] [Baddkopp groaning] [light dramatic music] You know the first time that somebody called me sir is when I had the barrel of this gun down their throats. Didn't pull the trigger. It wasn't worth the bullet. Yeah, yeah, big man with a gun. I don't need a gun. 'Cause I got these puppies. It takes me back to my first. And you know what they say, you always remember your first. [Kane chuckling] Had my hands wrapped around her neck, just squeezing slowly, slowly. I looked her right in the eyes and I could see the life just draining out of her. Hm, much like you did with Muppy. Her name is Anya. What how you guys do it, whatever. Was quite the Grand Guignol. Well, the show must go on. Yeah, and I'm center stage. You know, I used to be reckless once. Carefree, always out for a good time, and then this happened. I thought for sure my life was over. You know I even considered options. There are no options. Yeah, well I didn't do it now did I? You know, maybe I really did want her. I felt her kick for the first time, my heart melted. [apple crunching] [Cheetos crunching] [door creaking] [dramatic music] Go check it out. [girl giggling] Whoa, whoa, calm down. Ah, fuck. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, baby, just like that. Cup the balls, cup the balls. Ooh, I'm almost there. - Bring me home, Candy. - Bro. - Yeah, bring me home! - Bro, listen, I don't even like dick and I know that's too much teeth. The fuck are you doing here? Fucking perv, get it. Look, listen, this isn't my cup of tea either, but I think before you cum, the two of you should go. Who the fuck is this bitch? Hey, hey, hey, there's no need for escalation or labels. I'm trying to help you here. - Fuck this. - Just go over there. [dramatic music] What the fuck, you throwing my bitch? I throw my bitch. [Raven] Again with the fucking labels. I'm tired of you. Fuck, looks like daddy's gotta clean up somebody's mess again. [muffled yelling] [Candy] Ah, get off of him! [Raven groaning] [dramatic music] [Raven groaning] - [baton thudding] - No, wait. [Kane] Need a hand? Clearly fuckin' had him. I thought the words you'd be looking for were thank you. At least I had the last one right. Hm. [Raven sighs] You ladies sorting things out? [Kane] Yeah. [Zoe] Go watch our guest. We'll clean this up. [fist thudding] Hey, come on. Why am I the only one not getting pussy around here? [fist thudding] [Kane groaning] Oh, cheap shot from the man bun. [Kane grunting] [baton thudding] [man groaning] I'm gonna say this once, so listen closely. My house, my rules. [Candy sniffling] ♪ One, two, I'm gonna kick you ♪ [foot thudding] [man groaning] ♪ Three, four ♪ Damn I shoulda shut that door. [foot thudding] [man groaning] Five, six, ah, fuck, Freddy, I'm your worst nightmare. [baton thudding] [Kane grunting] Woo. My, that boy put up a fight. Can't you already see that she's scared? Oh, you doin' all right darling? Everything's gonna be just fine. [neck snapping] [Kane grunting] You fucking animals, both of you. You know, I'm tired of it. Whatever you guys are gonna do, just do it and get it over with. In all good time, my dear. [Skylar scoffs] [keys jingling] Get her stowed. [light dramatic music] I don't know why you're looking at me like that. I didn't do shit to you. [light dramatic music] Bye, bitches, bye. Grow up. Go get lover boy, we'll dump him in the garage for now. Ah, no, uh, yeah, fuck that. Let's leave him out back and let the critters take care of him. What's the matter? Something or someone you hiding out there? What did you do? The fuck did you do? What was necessary. [Kane] Fuckin' bitch. [handcuffs clicking] This isn't gonna end well, is it? [Raven] Have faith, we'll get through this together. [Raven sighs] [dramatic music] - [hand slapping] - Thought the war was over. Your daddy issues are showing. That's crossing a line. And so was putting us all at risk. [Kane sighs] [light dramatic music] [hand slapping] [light dramatic music] [Kane sighs] Any more fuckin' surprises for me? Just relax. Here, let me help you relieve some of that tension. [zipper buzzing] [Kane moaning] [handcuffs clicking] Yeah, that's it. That's it, suck it. [Kane moaning] [light dramatic music] [key clinking] [handcuffs clicking] [Skylar panting] [Kane moaning] Seriously? I guess I just ain't feeling it. [zipper buzzing] Guess you're no Abel, Kane. [light dramatic music] [bed creaking] - [Skylar groaning] - Ow. Oh, jeez. Skylar, what are you doing? Jesus, how far did you think you were gonna get sweetheart? I wasn't. Fuck me. - Don't let them take my baby. - I'm not, I'm not. We're in this together, I promise. [Skylar panting] [dramatic music] Shit. Whoa, where's the fire? - Everything's cool, you can't... - You're the reason - he's fucking dead. - Let go of me. - [picture frame thudding] - Ow, fuck. - Oh, you wanna play, huh? - Shit. [Kane] I'm gonna fuck you just for fun. - No, just stop, please stop. - Get right on ya. - Get off of her! - No, please, help, no! [Kane] See how rigid you really are. - Fuck, please, no. - Come here, you bitch. Fucker! [mallet thudding] Please, no! [Raven panting] [Kane] Oh, you fucking bitch. - No, stop. - Come here. Oh, fuck! - Jesus. - Raven! Here. You bitch! [mallet thudding] Motherfucker! [gunshot banging] [Raven gasping] He was raping her! [Skylar panting] [glass clinking] [Raven groaning] Oh yeah, the bitch shot me. Raven, we gotta get out of here. Ow. - We gotta get out of here. - Okay, yeah. - Come on. - Okay. [lighter clicking] [light dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [Skylar gasping] I was a mother to you. Oh, yeah? Well I feel the love. Feel this. [gun clicking] [Skylar gasping] [gun clicking] Goddammit! All right. You've had your fun. Now, back up. Nice and slow. Are you fucking crazy? Darlin', you're either really brave or really stupid. Not wise to test me. [Raven whimpering] [Skylar panting] Move. Get in there. Ah, shit. [pistol thudding] [Raven groaning] You're not worth another bullet. [door thudding] [Skylar crying] There's nowhere for you to run. [fist pounding] You're both gonna have to come out eventually. Where you gonna go? Fight all you want. [Zoe groaning] [Skylar crying] And just so you know... [Skylar screaming] I can cut it out of you. [Skylar panting] Forgive me. - [intense dramatic music] - My baby! You took her from me! I saved her. [Skylar panting] [Skylar sighs] She was mine! [gunshot banging] [blood splattering] Oh, my God. Oh, my God, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, stay with me. Stay with me, come on. Stay with me, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay, you'll be fine. - It's too late. - No, it's not. Please. [Raven gasps] No, no, no, God, no. We made it this far, come on. Stay with me, come on, Skylar, no. [Raven crying] [dramatic music] [Raven groaning] Fuckin' bitch. [Raven groaning] [gunshot banging] [shower knob squeaking] [water pattering] [dramatic music] [Raven crying] [dramatic music] [baton thudding] [water pattering] [dramatic music] [neck snapping] [dogs barking] [water pattering] [dramatic music] [neck crunching] [dogs barking] [water pattering] [dramatic music] [mallet thudding] [dogs barking] [water pattering] [dramatic music] [glass shard thudding] [dogs barking] [water pattering] [gunshot banging] [dogs barking] [whistle blowing] [crashing] [booming] [Raven crying] [dogs barking] [static buzzing] [light eerie music] [suspenseful music] [dramatic music]
