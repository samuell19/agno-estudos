See you soon! - Bye Cleo. (engine rumbling) (rock music) - What. (laughs) - Hey! You found the place! I was expecting you yesterday. - I'm sorry about that. I fell in love. - Nice. What's her name? - Albuquerque, New Mexico. The best chili I've ever had. I didn't think I'd be able to say goodbye. - Well, to be honest, goodbyes have never really been the issue for you, right? It's more the staying put part. - Ouch. - Sorry. - You never know what else is gonna be out there on the horizon, do ya? - Yeah, I guess you're right about that. - It's good to see a familiar face. - Yeah, it's good to see you too man. You look good. Thanks for coming. - Are you kidding me? I would not miss my little brother's 30th birthday party for the world. - Thanks man. What about you? This your new ride? - Yeah. - Nice. - You want to ride it? - I do want to take it for a spin. I have a meeting with my lawyer downtown pretty much right now, so... - I'll even let you drive. - Excellent. - Hey, do you know of any good farmer's markets around here? (sweet whimsical music) - Hey Cleo. - Hey Wendy! These persimmons look incredible. Are they sugary or do they have a good bite? - They're just right. - Perfect. Thank you, see you later! (sighs) - You gonna give those poor guys a complex. - What do you mean? - None of them are good enough for ya. How do you think that makes them feel? - Fruits don't have feelings. - Persimmons a fruit? - Yeah, they have seeds. - So does that mean a cucumber's a fruit? - As is a pepper. - Okay, how bout a sesame seed bagel? - Just because it has seeds doesn't mean it's a fruit but all fruit, they have seeds. - Wow! So you're a chef? - Oh no, is it that obvious? - Well, you know, the chef's coat and the clogs, yeah sort of give it away. - Yeah. I actually, I have a food truck. - You have a food truck, really? That's cool, what's it called? - Cleo's Kitchen. - And are you Cleo? - I am. - It's not to meet you, I'm Gabe. - Hi Gabe, nice to meet you. - Okay, this actually, this works out well. I just got to town, do you know of any, any really good lunch places? - Cute, that's cute. - No, I'm serious. What kind of food do you make? - I make sandwiches. - [Gabe] Okay, what kind of sandwiches? - Really special ones. - What makes 'em so special? - Well, I take old Italian classics like panini and meatball parm and I make them better. - Okay. I always say, nothing beats a great sandwich. - You know, that's exactly what I think, Gabe. - It was nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you. (lively music) - You know, that song used to play day and night from that very store. I said, that song used to play day and night from that very store. - Oh well, this was my grandfather's store. - Your grandfather was Matteo Morelli? - Matteo, he made the best panini in the whole of the City of Roses. - Yes, well it was probably his secret sauce. He called it sapore. - You don't say. Hey, I think I remember a little girl that wore an apron that went down to her toes, ringing the bell, taking the numbers. Is that you? - Yeah, I used to come here every day after school. - Well how bout that. I miss Matteo, he was a master. - Yeah, he was. He loved his work. Well, it was nice meeting you. Ciao! - Ciao. (upbeat instrumental music) (sultry Italian music) - Hey Cleo. - Hey Andy, you got the bread? - Right out of the oven. - Look perfect, thank you. Isn't fresh bread a miracle? - There's nothing like it. And there's nothing like making it either. - Oh, don't start. - What? All I'm saying is wouldn't it great to have a great big wood burning oven? - Here we go. - An eight burner stove. - Andy. - Or a big giant walk in fridge or maybe two? - Yes, it would be amazing to have all those things if we had a full service restaurant and cooked plated meals. - Well, why can't we? - Because I'm not that kind of chef. I don't make clever appetizers or elaborate entrees. I make the sandwiches my grandfather taught me to make. It's a family tradition. - I'm just saying, I've eaten dinner at your place like what, 100 times, and every time it's amazing. Your carbonara's the best I've ever had. - Really? - By far. - Aw, thanks Andy, I appreciate that. But right now, we are in the sandwich business, so let's get ready to make some sammies. - Well, when you decide to upgrade, just know you have my full support. - I'll think about that. - Think about what? - [Andy] Oh hey Laura! - Andy, he's just lobbying me to open a restaurant again. - You should call Jeff. (groans) - Jeff the chef? - Yeah, I heard he opened his fourth place. - No, breaking up with Jeff was the best thing that I ever did. - He was cute and crazy about you. - The only thing Jeff was crazy about was himself, like every other chef I have ever met. Lunch time! - I have to get to the hair salon. I got a cut and curl in five. Bye guys! - Bye! Hey there. - Can I get one roma and one Palermo please? - Yep, coming right up. (bell dings) (rock music) - So you've never heard of it? - Cleo's Kitchen, no. You say it's a food truck? - [Gabe] Yeah. - Supposed to be good? - I don't know, I met the owner, she seemed nice. - Oh, I get it. You don't care about the kitchen, you're just looking for Cleo. - Not true. I'm looking for a good meatball parm. My hunch is she makes a good one. - All right, well you follow that hunch. Unfortunately, I have no idea where she parks. - They should have a food truck app you know, so you could find where the trucks are parked. - You know, that's not a bad idea, actually. - You're welcome. - [Nate] Yeah, I gotta go, good luck. - All right, see ya man. (sweet instrumental music) - See you tomorrow. - Hey Cleo! I have the best news ever! - Tessa, what are you doing here in the middle of the afternoon? - Spring break just started. - Oh. - Hey Tessa. - Hi Andy! Listen to this you guys. Introducing the first annual City of Roses food truck competition, hosted by legendary Portland chef and TV personality, wait for it, Norma Duncan! - Norma Duncan! Wait, but why would she host a food truck competition? - Food trucks are the rage. Plus it's great exposure for her. - Like she needs more exposure. She's got three restaurants and a cooking show. - Well, maybe she's trying to reach a younger audience, people like me. - Uh, what's the winner get? - I can't believe I'm about to say these words but, $100,000. - Uh, you could do a lot with that kind of money. - Like expand the business. - Or open a restaurant. - You want to open a restaurant? - Yes. - No. So wait, when is it? - Saturday May 8th. - That's in a month, we gotta get on it. - I don't know you guys. A competition. Food is not a sport, it's a basic necessity. - I wouldn't say your sriracha braised short rib cheese steak qualifies as a necessity. - Not until you try it. - Good point. - Come on Aunt Cleo, at least try to qualify. - What do you mean qualify? - The six trucks with the most online nominations will compete. The deadline is a week from today. - There's a lot of really spectacular and innovative chefs working out of their trucks these days. Just not sure we're make the cut. - You can't make the cut if you don't try. (soft building instrumental music) - Okay, what do I have to do? (giggling) - Just get as many followers on social media as possible and have them nominate you. - Okay, how do I do that? - Just give the green light to be your social medial director. - I think you already are. - Then we're a go? - We are a go. (cheers) (bell dings) - So what do you do if you win? - Fix the truck, maybe get a second one. - What if you don't? - What do mean? I'm gonna keep on doing what I'm doing, I'm doing great and you are destroying a perfectly good meal. - I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but mom wants me to lean on you to come work with us. - No, doing real estate would eat my soul, no offense. - None taken. - [Cleo] Nothing makes me happier than using fresh ingredients to prepare food that people will enjoy. Why would I give that up? - You shouldn't. You definitely shouldn't. That is amazing! You ought to put that on the menu. - But it's not a sandwich. - Maybe it's time to branch out. - [Cleo] Hey, hey! - Aunt Cleo, can you do that again and this time, Dad say "ow" or something. - Why are you filming us? - I'm filming everything from now on, just in case something amazing happens. Cleo, maybe you should hit my dad with a frying pan. - Or maybe you should come up with something that doesn't land me in the hospital. - All right, here we go. Dinner for two. - You not eating? - No, I gotta get back to the commissary. Here you are. Bon appetit. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Bye! (upbeat instrumental music) - Cheers buddy. - So, did you ever find your mysterious sandwich maker? - You mean my meatball parm? - Yeah, sure. Whatever you say. - I didn't. I did get a good tour of the city, though. This place has changed a lot. - It's still great though. The parks, good food, younger brothers. What, I'm just saying. Portland is a great place to live. - Sure, if you're looking for a place to live. - Touche. Oh, by the way, looked into that app idea of yours. - Oh yeah. - Unfortunately, already exists. - Hey, good news is I'll be able to find her tomorrow. - Her? Oh you mean the meatball parm. - Right. - Right. Well, since we're on the subject of food, is you know who aware that you're back in town yet? - My former boss? No. - You gonna see her? - No. No, I doubt she wants to see me. I left because things didn't work out. - Did you leave because things didn't work out or did things not work out because you left? - It's a good question. (Italian music) - Here you go and don't forget to nominate us for the food truck competition. - Will do. (Tessa laughs) (upbeat rock music) (beeping) - Is he waving? - Not to me. - He's waving at me. - [Tessa] You know him? - Not really. - Then why is he waving at you? - [Cleo] I'm sure we'll find out. - He's coming over here. - What's in the bag? - Persimmons. - You don't know him but he's coming over here with a bag of persimmons? - [Cleo] It's a long story. Shh! - You're a hard food truck to find. - Not really, there's an app. - Oh yeah, yes I know, I'm up to speed now, thank you. - So, you are in the bacon game, huh? - Oh bacon's no game. Brought you these. Little neighborly gift. - Neighbor. Does that mean you're gonna be parked right over there? - That depends. Now, I don't want to step on any toes, I really don't. - No, my toes are fine and thank you so much for those, but I think I'm supposed to be (laughs) welcoming you into the neighborhood. Can I get you anything off my sandwich menu? - Really, oh! It all looks good. Oh wow, meatball parm, yeah. - One Verona. - Thank you. Hey, take your time, I'm gonna fire up the grill. I'll be back in a few minutes, okay? - Bye. (plucky instrumental music) - So, right when we're trying to get nominated for the competition. Now we have to compete with a customer. - I'm not worried. - You're not? - No, what's wrong with a little healthy competition? - Is bacon healthy? (rock music) - Do you smell that? - Yep. - Bacon. (slow acoustic music) Hey! How's was the Verona? - Hey there. Okay, that Verona, it was really, really special. The meatballs were fluffy, still crispy, and then that, the, the pesto instead of the marinara. Whew, it was really spectacular. - It's actually not pesto, it's sapore, my grandfather's recipe. - Grandfather's recipe, wow. It was the best meatball parm I've had in a long time, so thank you. - So, are you going to be parking in the same spot tomorrow? - I don't know, I mean look, I like the area, I do, but I don't want to, I don't know, I don't want to impose. I've heard the food truck scene can get a little territorial in this town. - Are you not from here? - No, yes, I am. I just been out of town for a while and I didn't have a food truck back then. - I think there's plenty of business for everyone. - Okay, hope I don't take too many of your customers then. - Oh! (laughs) Is having a huge ego a requirement for being a male chef? (laughs) - No, I was kidding, I was kidding! I really, I don't want to mess with you business. - I have a pretty loyal following, I'm not worried. - Hey, if the rest of your sandwiches are half as good as that Verona, you deserve it. - What is this? - Dinner. I assume you haven't eaten anything yet. - No, thanks. I'll eat it when I get home. - Good, enjoy. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (joyful acoustic music) - And there we have it, rack of lamb, lamb jus, garlic roast potatoes and collard greens. Now that's cooking with love. When we return I Norma Duncan, will bring home the flavors... (plucky instrumental music) - Bacon, lettuce and persimmons. - Say something about them - [Chloe] Okay, what should I say? - I don't know, like what are they? - These are fuyu persimmons. - Say it like you're on TV. - Right, this is a fuyu persimmon. No, I gotta stop, that was not good. - Hi everyone, Cleo from Cleo's Kitchen here again and we are at the farmer's market shopping for lovely fuyu persimmons. - That was really good, maybe you should do it. - No, no, I'm not the chef. - Right, okay. (upbeat instrumental music) Hi everyone, I am Cleo from Cleo's Kitchen and today we are at the farmer's market checking out some amazing persimmons. This right here is the fuyu persimmon, which unlike the hachia, has no tannins. It's not so bitter. Get them early enough, it's not so sweet either. - And what do you like to do with them? - Well, my grandfather, he used to roast it with rosemary and olive oil and chop them into little pieces and put them in a salad. Or you could actually substitute them for a tomato and put them in a BLT. I call this the BLP. (Tessa laughs) - BLP, I love it. - Wait, no, no, no, Tessa you can't post that. - Don't worry, I won't. - Are you sure, because that is not my sandwich, don't do it. - Yeah, I'm sure. I was just practicing, but I mean, BLP, come on, that's foodie gold. - Good morning. - Morning! - Whatever that is, it smells amazing. - [Gabe] It's called breakfast, which I'm willing to bet has never been made in this house before. - You would certainly win that bet. You got the cooking gene my friend, not me. - That's cause mom was such an awful cook. - Oh man, she was bad wasn't she? - Wait, speaking of which, I love you, I do... - I love you too. - Why would you build such a nice house and have such a nice kitchen if you're never gonna cook in it? - It's actually for when you visit. Or for when you decide to stay longer than just a visit. - What's that supposed to mean? - I don't know, aren't you tired of driving all over the country all the time? - Tired of it? I'm just getting started. I haven't even been to the mid west yet. - What's in the mid west that's better than your little brother? (laughs) - I don't know, I haven't been there yet. - It's just I don't know, you've always thought there was something else out there, something better. - Maybe there is. - Yeah, maybe there isn't. - Hey come on, there is nothing better than my little brother. - Okay. - I mean that. Come on, I actually wanted to talk to you about this, I wanted to make you and your friends dinner for your birthday, would you like that? - Of course I'd like that, I'd love that. - Great. - So grandpa always said to make a good sandwich it's all about balance. Too much protein, you can't get your mouth around it. Too much sauce it all falls apart. You have to balance the savory with the sour and the heavy with the light. Tessa, we agreed a long time ago, if you are hanging out in the truck you gotta be working. - I am working! On getting you enough nominations to enter in the competition. - [Andy] Almost noon and no sign of Mr. Bacon. - Maybe he went somewhere else. - Good for us. - I don't know, it was kinda nice having a little company on the corner. - Wait a second! Are you crushing on bacon dude? - No. - Yeah you are, I can tell! - No, I'm not, seriously. He's an egotistical chef. Just like all the rest. - Yeah right. I'm a teenager, I know a crush when I see one. - Tessa, you may be my niece but I am not above 86'ing you from my kitchen. (laughs) - Crush! - No, stop you guys, get back to work. Stop, stop. (rock music) (Andy laughs) - You gotta hand it to the guy, he's got great timing. - [Gabe] Okay, that's 18, I owed you two. - You look annoyed. - Those people are our regulars. Mason. - We have the jammer, wrap style. - Patty. Even Kyle. He hasn't missed lunch on our truck since we opened! (plucky instrumental music) Laura, what are you doing? - Nothing. - What's in your mouth? - Nothing! - What's behind your back? - Oh! I found this. - You're eating food that you just found? - Okay fine, it's bacon fried rice and it is amazing. Honestly, it might be the best thing I've ever tasted. Do you want some? - No, I don't want some. - [Andy] Can I try? - No Andy, get back into the truck. - Why there's no customers. Wow, that's incredible! Is that cilantro? - Who cares, it's fabulous! - I can't believe you guys are eating his food! Along with everyone else in the neighborhood. - Well, you better believe it sister. And just for the record, that guy is so cute he could sell saltines and make a killing. - I wonder if everything's that yummy? - I saw someone with ravioli that looked insane. - Wait, what? Bacon ravioli? Genius! (upbeat music) What's that smile mean? - Oh, you know what it means. - Is it on? - Yes, it is definitely on. (plucky instrumental music) You should just do it, just call him. - [Laura] No, it's not nice. - You're giving him business. - So he'll get overwhelmed and you'll get his overflow. I'm not doing it! Rude! - Okay. Welcome to the food truck wars. - Listen! - Here you go, that's okay, I owe you two. Thanks so much have a good night. Mo Bacon! - Hi, hello, I'd like to place an order for a pick up please. - Sure, what can I get for ya? - I want two, no make that six bacon fried rice, three bacon raviolis, and five BLTs. - Thank you so much, have a good. Yeah, is that it? - No, of course it's not it, I hope you guys have a pen. - No, it's okay, I got it. What else can I get for you? - All right, I will have eight bacon ramens, three bacon buns, and six bacon papusas. (upbeat music) - Here you go. - The guy's a machine! - That's you. Okay awesome, here you go. I owed you a dollar, thanks. - I thought the whole point was to make him so busy you'd get the spill over. (phone buzzing) - It's for you. - Hello. - Hey, Mo Bacon, your order's all set. - Yeah, I'll be right there. - That's okay, I'll bring it over. (plucky instrumental music) - He's coming over here. - Hey, how ya doin'? Here. - Thank you. - You're so welcome, enjoy! - What do I owe you? - Forget about it. It's on the house. - Well, that didn't work. (phone rings) - Hey, sis! What a nice surprise. - Oh, I was in the neighborhood, thought I'd stop and say hi. - So, how's the sandwich biz? - It is great. - Really? That's not what Tessa says. - What did Tessa say? - That some bacon guy's giving you a hard time. - Who's been giving my daughter a hard time? - It's nothing. Mom, how's it going? - Oh, it's fine. What's Tim talking about? - Oh, just this guy, he parked his truck on my block, but don't worry, the novelty will fade. - Well, I know some people down at City Hall. I can send an inspector down to check his permit. - That's to evil. - It's not evil when you're protecting your family. - He's just a nice guy trying to make a living just like me. I'm not gonna sabotage him like that. - I thought you already tried. - I did yeah, and I learned my lesson. - Well, if the conflict escalates, you can take a little hiatus and work with us. There's an office down the hall with your name on it. - It's true. She got a name plate printed and everything. - I'm not gonna take a hiatus from my dream. I am a chef... - Who makes sandwiches out of a truck you mean. - For now. - For the last five years I might add. - Pop pop made sandwiches. - So his children and his grandchildren wouldn't have to. - And here we go! - Oh, it just breaks my heart thinking of you on your feet all day, exposed to the elements. - I'm not in a convertible, Mom. - I am your mother. Can you blame me for wanting what's best for you? - I am doing what I love, believe me. - Are you sure? - Positive. - All right, that's all I care about. - Weren't you just going on about how you wish she'd meet a great guy and settle down to? - Well I mean, I can care about more than one thing at the same time. I mean, I love both of you, don't I? Most of the time. (plucky instrumental music) - I heard you might be out here. - Where'd you hear that? - Well, Laura was giving me a hair cut and I was, we were chatting, and she said that if you weren't in your truck you would be here. - Doesn't look like you got a hair cut. - No, I mean, she only took a little bit off. - We decided, it's fine the way it is, right. - Right. (laughs) - I just wanted to swing by and say kudos on your prank the other day. - Oh yeah. (laughs) Welcome to the neighborhood. - Thanks. (laughs) - What do you got going on here? Can I help, give you a hand? - Yeah, that'd be great. I'm just digging a hole, so do you want to make the hole for me? - Want me to do the hole, I'll do the hole. - Yeah, here's the shovel. - What are we doing here, how big we going? - I'll tell you when to stop. - Manual labor and dirt. I'll be inside. - Make yourself at home! - Oh I will. - She always makes herself at home. So have you done much gardening, Gabe? - As a matter of fact, none, zero. - Really, how come? - People say that apparently gardens need tending and I tend to be a little restless with that sort of thing. - Oh, I think there's nothing like seeing the tiny green shoots pop out of the soil and turn into full grown flowers and vegetables. - Do you use these in your food? - Yeah, all the time. But I donate most of the them to the local food bank. - Wow, that's really generous of you. - It's my way of giving back to the community. Portland is my home. And what about you, where's your home? - My home? My food truck. I've been driving around the country in that thing for a few years now and I stop somewhere for a few days, spend a few months somewhere else. - Looking for? - Good food, interesting people. - Good food, interesting people, sounds like Portland. - So I've heard. - I think you've, I think you did a great job. - Yeah, that's enough? - Yeah, looks awesome. - Great! - So now we're gonna take that, that plant right there, and then we'll just stick it in. Can you do that? - Yeah, let's do it. All right. - One, two, three. (groans) - All right, get it all straightened out here. That's it? - Good job. So, are you going to enter the competition? - What competition? - Norma Duncan's food truck competition. - Norma Duncan is doing a food truck competition? I have zero interest in entering a food truck competition. - Why, you think it's beneath you? - Last time I checked, food wasn't a sport. - I agree with you. - Well then why are you doing it? - Oh, (throat clears) I can think of 100,000 reasons why. - Good point, got it. - But I need nominations to qualify. - Wait, would it help you if I'll park my truck away from you. I want you to have every advantage possible. - If I can't up my game against one truck how do I expect to win a whole competition? But thank you. Well, this looks good. You did a nice job. - Yeah, is it... - Yeah. I think we're done. - That was fun. - So, are you gonna be parked on the corner tomorrow? - I hope so. Unless... - Unless what? - Okay, the real reason I came by here was I wanted to see if you would show me all the good places to eat in town. - Yeah, yeah I can do that. When were you thinking? - Well, I gotta go home and get dressed and cleaned up and then I could be back here by seven. - Great, I'll see you then. - Perfect. - We are just checking out the local food scene. - Is that what you're wearing? - Yeah, what's wrong with it? - Nothing. If you're trying not to make an impression. - We're just hanging out. Am I supposed to be in a fancy gown? - There is no such thing as being over dressed. - I disagree. - At least let me fix your hair. - Laura. (door knocks) Too late! (soft instrumental music) - Hey there. - Hi! - You look great. - Thanks, you too! You ready? - Yeah, I'm starving. - All right, two bowls of Macdaddy and Cheese with mixed greens. - Looks so delicious! - My pleasure Cleo, good luck in your contest. - You too Suzy! So good! - This looks so good! - It's delicious. - Oh wow, so this is one of your favorites? - Favorite. All. - Man, you're the bacon guy. - Yeah, that's me. - Oh my God. Great grub! Really man, outstanding! - Aw, thank you very much, I appreciate that. - Well, see you soon. - Thanks man, take it easy. - Bye. You are developing quite the following. - Yeah! - Yeah. (laughs) - I can't believe how much the food truck scene has grown here. - Oh yeah, Portland is a foodie paradise. That's why I love it here so much. - Wait, where you from originally? - Born and raised right here, never left. - You're from here? - Yeah. - Wow and you never wanted to leave? - No. I mean, look at this place. How could you ever leave? (sweet instrumental music) - Pretty breath taking. (laughs) - Thanks. - Thank you very much. - Do you want to walk around a little bit? This is my favorite neighborhood in Portland. - Yeah, I'd love to. (sweet instrumental music) - And this was my grandfather's store. - Wait, really? - Yeah, he's the one who taught me how to made a sandwich. - This is incredible. Did you ever think of opening something here? - No, I like my truck. - [Gabe] What do you like about it? - It just makes sense. People come, they order something, I don't have to deal with the wait staff, the reservations, not to mention the cancellations. - That's all the fun stuff. - What do you mean by that? - Working with people, that's my favorite part of the business. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love cooking. But like the last couple of restaurants I worked at, I felt like I was always trapped in the kitchen all night, missing all the action. - My niece, she calls that FOMO. - FOMO? - Fear of missing out. - Got it. Maybe that's why I'm always on the go. (Italian style music) Can you see? Oh wow! - It would make a really cool restaurant though. - Yeah. You win that contest you'll be well on your way. I'd help you out however I can. - Really? Like what? - I make great wall if you ever need to bounce anything off me. Tennis balls, meat balls, ideas. You name it. - Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. (door clicks) - So? How did it go? Did you have fun? - Hm, we did. - And? - And he's nice. Okay, he's really nice. - Even for a chef? - Especially for a chef. - Did he kiss you goodnight? - No. - Did he try to? - No. - That is nice. - I know. - Hi everyone, my name is Cleo from Cleo's Kitchen and today we are at the farmer's market checking out these amazing persimmons. These are fuyu persimmons, which is unlike the hachia. You could substitute them for a tomato and put them in a BLT. (dark plucky music) I call this the BLP. (laughing) (phone dings) - Oh. - Is that him? - Yeah. - What does he say? - He said I stole something from him. - His heart? - No. His sandwich. (upbeat music) - [Andy] What's a BLP? - Bacon, lettuce and persimmon sandwich. - Sounds interesting, is it any good? - It's amazing. I'll be right back. - Here you go, thanks so much, enjoy. Okay, you had the BLP on rye, right? Here you are, okay. Two to Chase. Okay, two sour doughs, here you are, enjoy. Next! - I'm sorry, that video was never supposed to get posted. - Uh huh, did you want to order something? - Yes, I will have a BLP please. - Sour dough, wheat or rye? - Just make it the way you made it for me the other night. - You liked it huh? - Yes, loved. - So much so that you wanted to steal it? - I didn't, honestly. Tessa, my niece, she filming me and I didn't know what to say on camera and your sandwich was on my mind so I just blurted it out. But I told her not to post it because I knew that it wasn't my recipe. - So why did she post it then? - She's a teenager, she posts everything. I'm really sorry, though. I told her to take it down and she did immediately. I would never, ever steal from another chef. - But you would name it. BLP. - Yeah, it's not bad, right? - It's genius. - Well, it's all yours. - And this is all yours. - Thanks. What do I owe you? - That is what they call a free lunch. (plucky instrumental music) - There's no such thing as a free lunch. - Except for this time. - Thanks for this. (upbeat music) - Oh thank you, appreciate it, have a good day. - [Pam] One napoli, one Palermo please. - [Tessa] Pam, right. - [Pam] Yeah. - [Tessa] Coming right up, Pam and don't forget to go online and nominate us for Norma Duncan's food truck competition. - Already did. - Perfect! Here's one napoli and one Palermo. - We've got three Palermoes all day. - Uh, what's going on? - [Cleo] What does it look like, we're slammed! - [Laura] Yeah, I know but why? - Buy one get one free. - Isn't that giving away a lot of food? - Half of a lot of food is more than all of none. - I guess that's true. - One roma, one napoli, and two Veronas and don't forget to nominate us for the food truck contest. (slow instrumental music) - When do you find out about the contest? - Any minute now. - Really, how many nominations did you get? - 4,000. - 4,000! 4,000 nominations! - I know! - I feel like, did you win? I feel like you won, that's amazing! - No, I just hope it's enough to qualify. - At the very least you could just know that that's 4,000 compliments to the chef right there. - I guess you're right about that. (phone dings) - Uh oh. - You think that's? - That's it. - Okay, here we go! Let's look! Yes! - I made it. I made it! (laughs) I made it! (sweet instrumental music) - That's, I was just, I'm so... I'm excited for you, that's amazing! - Maybe you'll be around long enough to see me compete maybe? - Might be. Look, I'll be honest with ya, this town's really starting to grow on me. (laughs) Wow! - I know! - And I was here for it, I was standing right here. - You were here! (phone buzzing) - Oh, it's my brother, hold on. - Is something wrong? - It looks like, it looks like I qualified too. - Wait you qual... I thought that you said you don't believe in food truck competitions. - I don't. - Then how did you qualify? - He said that they were all write-in ballots. - Oh. (plucky instrumental music) Wow! - It's just... - Yeah, so are you gonna compete or? - Like you said, I could think of 100,000 reasons why I should. - Right. Well, may the best chef win. - [Andy] Wait, what? Gabe qualified for the contest? - [Cleo] Yep. - [Andy] I didn't even know he entered. - He didn't either. People just nominated him. - And, how do you feel about that? - Fine, fine. - I don't know, it's just Gabe's food is pretty spectacular. - Andy, everyone's food is gonna be spectacular but our mission is not to be the best of the worst, it is to be the best of the best. - Do you really think we can win with just sandwiches? - I wouldn't try if I didn't. Oh! - Bacon cherry jam, that's right. (plucky instrumental music) - $100,000, that's a lot of cheddar. - Yeah, I know. - You don't seem very excited. - Ach, I don't believe in food competitions. - So you're a purist now? - No, I didn't really sign up for the contest. - Well, that can be easily remedied. - What do you mean? - Well, what's the real problem? - It's Norma Duncan's competition. - Ah, let me guess, you still haven't told her you're in town? - I haven't. I don't know, I'm probably gonna skip the whole thing. - Skip the whole thing. And what just drive off into the sunset again? - Sure, why not? - Look Gabe, none of these things are problems that you need to run away from. - Then what are they? - I don't know, most people just call them what they are, excuses. (laughs) Look, I'm just saying, before you make up your mind, talk to Norma. I'm sure it's water under the bridge by now. - There's a meet and greet today for all the competitors so maybe I'll go early and talk to her. - Perfect, that's a great idea! Let's go! - Wait, what do you mean, I thought we were going hiking. - No, no, no I'm not giving you any excuses to be late, come on, I'll race ya! - Are you serious? - Yeah, I'm for real. Let's go. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - I could do this backwards, let's go! - I'm not racing, I just... - Oh come on! (yelling) (sweet instrumental music) - Hi, Jenny, how is everything coming along? - Great, we're all ready to go! Just waiting for everyone to arrive, but we're not supposed to start for another 15 minutes. - Has everyone RSVP'd? - Everyone but Mo Bacon. - That's right, Mo Bacon. Now, did we ever find the name of that chef? - No, the truck isn't on social media and since they didn't officially enter the contest, we have no idea who it is. - Well, it's very mysterious, but that's also what's so very fascinating about this competition. You never know where you're going to find the next great chef. (rock music) You have got to be kidding me. - Hey there Norma. (plucky instrumental music) - So, how long has it been? - Five years, give or take. - What brings you to town? - My little brother's 30th birthday. - Oh, I see. And were you planning on reaching out to me? - Honestly, I didn't think you'd want to see me. - Oh Gabriel, please! Don't be so dramatic. We were planning on opening a restaurant and I admit, I was excited to work with you. But it's not as if you stole money from me or anything. - Yeah, I know, but... - But what? What happened, why did you disappear? - Honestly, I just got cold feet. You've got a TV show, published books. I mean, you're Norma Duncan, The Norma Duncan. You believed in me. I think it was just a little too much pressure. - You should have talked to me. - I know, I know. I was never very good at that. - So why now? Are you turning over a new leaf? (sweet instrumental music) - Yeah, I might be. Look, I just, I really want you to know that I'm sorry I disappeared. I only did it because I didn't want to disappoint you. - Well, you did disappoint me because our restaurant, it would have been terrific. (sweet instrumental music) - They know each other? Weird. - I'm very glad you're home. - Thank you. It's good to be back. I really hope this weather clears up though, for the competition. - Well, the forecast looks good. Says it's supposed to clear and besides, you can't have roses without a little bit of rain. (plucky instrumental music) - Hi, I'm glad you're here. - Yeah. - What's up with you and Norma? - Tessa, shh! - Oh, we go back a long way. You know, it's actually a pretty long story. - Welcome chefs and congratulations for qualifying for the first annual City of Roses food truck competition! (audience clapping) Now, my assistant Jenny, is handing out the rules for the contest as we speak and I must tell you, due to the overwhelmingly positive response, we've decided to add another category to the competition. So the grand prize, of which I will still be the judge, remains the same at $100,000. However, we will be adding the audience favorite award, the prize of which will be $10,000. For a chef, what is important is what the customer wants. As a chef, what I am looking for is something in all of you. I am looking for inspiration. I am looking for something unique. I'm looking for which one of you cooks with the greatest amount of love. And on that note, I'm gonna with you good luck, happy cooking and I will see you all at the contest. (audience clapping) (plucky instrumental music) - This is exciting! - Yeah, I'm really excited. It's gonna be a lot of fun. Hey Gabe, can I ask you something? I don't mean to pry or anything, but how come you never mentioned that you knew Norma? - So, it was a long time ago and I ran away and it was, I apologized and she forgave me. She deserves every bit of her fame and success. She's a class act. You remind me of her. - Me? (slow sweet instrumental music) I remind you of Norma Duncan? - You do. 'Cause listen, the most important thing to her is cooking with love and you are just 100% in love with what you do. - Yeah, I am. But I have to admit, I'm like a little nervous about the competition over there. - You are? Why, anyone in particular? - Just everyone. All the chefs seem so good. It just made me realize that I can't afford to play it safe. - You shouldn't. - Easier said than done. We have one week. That's not enough time to come up with new recipes and sandwiches and ideas. - Idea, I'm cooking dinner for my brother and his friends tomorrow night. Do you want to come over and help and then we could, we could experiment a little? - Yeah. I would love that.

(laughs) - You've actually timed yourself? - Kind of a right of passage of cooking school. - So, where did you study? - Culinary Institute. I didn't finish though. - You dropped out? - I got kicked out actually. - Oh, I'm sorry. It's just, how do you get kicked out of culinary school? - I wouldn't follow the recipes and when they're testing you on how well you follow the recipes, they don't really like that. How bout you? - Um, I actually never went to cooking school. I've always felt a little insecure about it. - You shouldn't. I can see you know what you're doing. - You know you're not breaking any records cutting those mushrooms. - Here's your lemons. You want a show? - Thank you. - Set your timer. - I got my timer set. - Okay, what do you want, diced, chopped, minced? You call it. - Oohh, chopped with a julienne. - Yes chef. (slow Italian style music) (grunts) The short ribs are amazing! - Oh thanks. - What's that? - Oh, it's my grandfather's secret sauce, the sapore I was telling you about. - Oh yeah, nice! - Do you want to try some? - Yeah. (slow instrumental music) Oh wow! That's like the pesto but better. - Yes. - Wow! What if we serve that on the pasta we made. - You think? - Yeah, absolutely. - Can I ask you something? Do you think I'm bearing the lead? - What do you mean? - I mean, I make all these dishes, like roasted garlic chicken, braised short ribs, (speaking in foreign language) and then I trap them inside of two pieces of bread instead of serving them as is. - I think they speak for themselves. But do you want to try and serve them tonight without the bread? - I don't know. I guess I'm game. - Okay. (tapping) - [Nate] Wow, this place looks great! You guys have outdone yourselves! - Hey there birthday boy! So this is Cleo. Cleo, this is my little brother Nate. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Same, although I feel like I kind of already know you. - Is that so? - Well, he cannot stop talking about your, how'd you put it, amazing sandwiches, I believe? (throat clears) - Cleo was kind enough to come and help us with your big birthday dinner tonight. - Oh, well thank you very much, that's very kind. - It's my pleasure. I love dinner parties! - That is very clear. - Hey, what time did you say everyone was coming? - Should be any time. (doorbell rings) Scratch that, how bout right now? You guys ready? Here we go. Hey Jennifer, thanks for coming! Come on in! (plucky Italian style music) - Nice. - Yeah, this is good. Okay, good evening, here we have a fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta. - With my grandfather's secret sapore sauce. - Thank you. - Did they like the pasta? - What do you think? (glass clinking) - Yes, birthday speech, birthday speech. Raise your glasses please. You know, from start to finish, this has been just a perfect birthday and thank you too, Cleo. The food was absolutely spectacular, right? (guests clapping) In fact, the two of you put on quite a show tonight and it's just a thought, but maybe you want to consider opening a restaurant together some time in the future. Just think about it, think about it. And last but not least, I'd like to thank my big brother Gabe. And not just for the lovely meal but more importantly, for coming home. It really is nice to have you back, bro. - Thanks. (sweet instrumental music) - Cheers. - Cheers. (glasses clanking) - Well, if it isn't Matteo's little helper again. You look like you're taking a stroll down memory lane. - Actually, I was imagining my future. - So, you all ready for the big competition? - Yeah, I'm getting there. Still experimenting with a few ideas. - Oh, changing things up this late in the game. - Taking risks, getting out of my comfort zone. - Really, how so? - Well, believe it or not, I am thinking about ditching the bread. - No more sandwiches, wow! What brought this on? - Well, you know that guy I was telling you about, Gabe? - The bacon guy. - Yeah, we were cooking together and I realized the food that I put in sandwiches is really great, so why would I limit myself? Uh oh, do you think it's a bad idea? - Actually no, I think it's been a long time coming. Listen Cleo, Pop pop was great at what he did and you've honored that tradition and now it's time to honor your own vision. - I'm gonna try. - So, what did you want to talk to me about? - Well, actually you know Pop pop's old store, The Grocery? - Yeah sure, what about it? - I can't get through to the number on the for lease sign so I was wondering if you could figure out who owns it. - Are you thinking about opening up a restaurant? - If I win the competition, maybe. - I will track down the owner as soon as I get back to the office. - Thanks Tim. - You kidding me? I can't wait to help you with this. - Hey man, just headed to work. Just wanted to say thanks again for last night, it was really great. Gabe? Gabe, you're hey. - Sorry. The rents have really gone up around here. - Yes, yes, they... Wait, are you looking for a place? - Just curious, really. - Are you serious? You know if you decide to stick around you're more than welcome to stay here as long as you like, right. - You can't fool me, I know you just like me for my food. - Look, I'll admit, the food is great. But the company is way better, really. - You're not so bad yourself, kid. - All right, think about it. See ya. - See ya! (soft instrumental music) - Okay, just imagine this with me. We have exposed brick. We have an open kitchen, old world charm, all while being in the heart of the city. - It's a no-brainer. - Yeah, my brother Tim, he's checking on the lease now. - Wow! That was fast. - Well, when you know, you know. - Why the change of heart? - Well, cooking for your brother and all his friends, it got me thinking, instead of giving people a sandwich to go eat on a bench, I want to make them dinner. I want to provide a place where people come to sit, have a glass of wine, over a good dinner, all while being in a beautiful environment. - Sounds like a dream come true. - Yes, so sharpen your knives buddy, 'cause I am cooking to win. (upbeat instrumental music) Okay Tim, I'll talk to you later, bye. - Well? - It's for sale and it's totally reasonable. - Yes! I can't believe you're gonna open a restaurant! - I have to call my dad! - No, no, no, I was just on the phone with your dad. - Right! I need to post the news. - No, no, no, don't post anything yet. I still have to win the competition and that is a tall order. - Right. So what should I do? - Honestly, I have a lot of work to do until the big day so if you guys, could you run the truck until then? I would be so grateful. - Yeah, whatever you need, boss. Just promise not to leave us behind. - Andy, no, we're a team. I couldn't imagine working without you. - We'll see, once you get your own cooking show. - Oh, I have an idea for that. I think you should have your own segment where people call in and they ask embarrassing cooking questions. - Oh, like an advice column for food. - [Cleo] Exactly! - I'll call it "Andy's Answers". - Perfect! - Tessa, maybe we can set a pilot up online. - Okay, I'll go first. - Oh guys! - I'm embarrassed to say this, but how do you make the perfect hard boiled egg? (slow instrumental music) (door knocks) - I'll be right there! - Hey you. - Hi. - Got you this. - Renunculus, oh you remembered! I'm just working on the recipe now. Do you want to come on in? - I smell it. - Yeah, I'm trying to nail down the sugo for the competition. I just don't know if it needs anything. So maybe you could try some and just tell me if it needs anything? - Yeah, happy to. - No, nothing. That's a winner. - Is it good enough to beat you? - Look Cleo, that's actually why I wanted to stop by. - Okay, what's up? - I just been thinking long and hard about it. I think I should skip the competition. - You're pulling out, why? - I know how much you want to win and how much you want to open your restaurant and I just don't want to get in the way. (slow instrumental music) - I see. - Hey, it's not like I signed up for the contest so I'm not gonna be bummed or anything. - Right, right, we wouldn't want you to be bummed or anything, would we? - Cleo, what's going on? Is something wrong? - Yeah Gabe, something is definitely wrong. - No, I thought you'd be happy. - Happy? I'm more insulted. - You're insulted? Why are you insulted? - You know, I'm really surprised that there's room in here for the both of you and your ego. - Ego? If I had an ego do you think I'd be dropping out? - Don't you see, you think your food is so good you're doing me a favor by dropping out. - Hey, I think you're an amazing chef, Cleo. - But I'm not as good as you, which is why right now you think you're being so noble. - No, no, I don't think I'm being noble. I think I'm, I think I'm being generous. - Generous? Wow that's even worse. - $100,000, that's a lot of money to give up. - Which you have to win first in order to give it up, which apparently you already think it's a done deal. - Okay, so are you saying that, you're saying you want me to do the competition? - Yeah, I do. How else can I beat you? (slow instrumental music) - Okay, fine, yeah, I guess it's game on. - Oh, it already was. - All right. Hey, don't forget the BLP was my sandwich. - Yeah well, I named it. - See you on the dance floor. (door knocks) - Coming! - Hey. - Hi. - What's wrong? - Oh nothing, I just burnt the croutons for the Brussels sprout Caesar. It's nothing, probably won't serve it anyway. - What, why not? I love that salad! - Can I ask you something? Do you think it's a dumb idea, changing courses late in the game? I mean, I been making sandwiches my whole life. Why change now? - Because your food deserves to be liberated from the narrow confines of bread. And you want to win. - Yeah, I do. - These are pretty, can I put them in some water? - Oh no, don't bother. They're from Gabe. - Okay. What happened? - Well, he said he wanted to drop out of the competition so I would have a better chance of winning. - That's pretty confident of him. - Yeah, I agree, thank you. - But still, it is pretty nice. I mean, at least his heart was in the right place. - If he has one. - I'm pretty sure he's got one. And I'd be willing to bet it's broken right now. - Broken, why? - He came over here to tell you he wanted you to win the competition and then you got mad at him. - Yeah, because he was being an egomaniac. - I know, I know but he couldn't have just driven off into the sunset and not even bothered to say goodbye. But instead, (slow instrumental music) he brought you flowers. - You're really smart, you are. - What's going on here? - I think I'm gonna take a little ride up the coast. - Ride up the coast. Isn't the contest tomorrow? - Yeah, I'm not really a food competition kind of guy though. - Okay yeah, stop, stop. What's going on? - It's just Cleo. - What about her? You guys seem to get along great. - And we do, we do. She really wants to win the competition then she gets the money and then she can open her own restaurant. That's her dream. - And? - And I told her I'd drop out. - Let me guess, she was insulted by that. - But I just want her to win. - Gabe no, you just want her to be happy, it's different. - No, if she wins, she gets to open her restaurant and that will make her happy. - Cleo wants to win and maybe she will and maybe she won't and maybe neither of you will, but you don't get to decide that for her. - I know, but listen to me. - No, you listen, you listen. Before you get in your truck and drive off again, just do me a favor and think about something, okay? What would make you, you happy, regardless of what happens with the contest? (soft instrumental music) - Thank you. Very wise, little brother. - Unpack this bag please. - I'll do that later, I got a lot of bacon to make! (uplifting instrumental music) - Heirloom tomatoes and Brussels sprouts. - Fresh papperdelle. - Check. - And what about these persimmons, are they coming? - Yeah, thanks. So, you're here for the competition, right? - I am. - I'm glad. - Good, me too. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for acting like I was doing you some big favor by dropping out. - It's okay. Tessa actually helped me understand the silver lining of it all. - I want to know. What's the silver lining, tell me. - You're still here. - Yeah, I am. I think I finally figured out what I've been looking for this whole time. - Oh yeah, and what's that? - A really good sandwich. - Then you're definitely gonna need these. (soft instrumental music) - You don't mind? - No. As long as I get the first one. - Oh yeah, done. - See ya on the dance floor? - Oh yeah, you will, it's a date. Hey, don't forget the most important part. - Oh yeah, what's that? - Cook with love. - I don't think that's gonna be a problem. (laughs) - Hello, hello everyone and welcome to the first annual City of Roses food truck competition! (clapping) I am so proud to be able to bring you some of the most innovative and experimental cooking our region has to offer. I'm also excited to be able to crown one of these six fabulous food trucks the winner of this competition's grand prize, a check for $100,000! (clapping) (uplifting instrumental music) And so, without further ado, let's eat. - And that is how it's done. - This is weird. - What is? - Not making sandwiches. - Weird as in good or weird as in bad? - Weird as in great! - Bye bye. Okay, who's next? - Looks like Gabe is doing really well. - Good for him. His food is really great. - I agree. - Oh hey, incoming. - Oh boy, here we go. - Andy, don't be nervous. - I'm not nervous. - Oh Cleo, I am very happy to see you again. - Hi Norma, it's so nice to see you and I have to tell you, it is a pleasure to be cooking for you. - Oh please. I eat food just like everyone else. Only one forkful at a time, sometimes two. (laughs) - I'd like to introduce you to my family, this here is my niece Tessa. That over there is my brother Tim, my mom Mary, and my bestie Laura and of course, you know Andy. - Wow, you must be proud. - Very. - How wonderful to have your family come and support the chef. - Well, we wouldn't miss it for the world. - All right, what's on the menu for today? (plucky instrumental music) - Coming right up. (soft instrumental music) - Well the first two were truly excellent. Each ingredient came together for something greater than its part. Nice work, Cleo. What's left? - This is a homemade papperdelle, freshly cut this morning, tossed in my family's sauce called sapore. - Well, the color is magnificent. Looks like a spring garden. And the aroma is just as divine. (plucky instrumental music) Simple yet elegant. Unique, yet quietly familiar. I like it, I think it's fantastic. - You do? - I do. It's not often that you find new flavors. What, may I ask, is the sauce made from? - Love. (uplifting instrumental music) - Hey, how'd it go? - I, bacon's always a crowd pleaser, I don't know. - I noticed. - How bout yours? - Well, I cooked as well as I could. - You should be proud of yourself. - And thank you for helping me get out of my comfort zone. - You're welcome, ditto. - Really? I didn't know I had. - I'm still here aren't I? - All right everyone, the moment that we've all been waiting for, but first I must say that every chef here is worthy of the grand prize. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for crafting such delicious foods from the confines of your mobile kitchens. Their dedication to the art of cooking should be admired. Give them a round of applause won't you? (audience claps) And Portland, we want to thank you for being such wonderful people to cook for. (audience claps) And on that note, I would like to announce the audience favorite award. (plucky instrumental music) Well, the jury is in and apparently Portland's favorite ingredient is bacon! (audience claps) Congratulations Gabriel. - Wow, thank you, thank you. - Don't go run away. Now there is one chef today whose innovation merged with classic cuisine in a truly magical way and it was obvious to me that this very talented chef has a very bright future ahead because this chef consistently cook with the most important ingredient in any chef's pantry and that ingredient is love. So it is with great pride that I announce the winner of the first annual City of Roses food truck competition, to Cleo Morelli! (joyous instrumental music) (audience claps) - Now do you believe in her? - Oh Tim, I always did! - Thank you, thank you! Wow. Thank you everyone for helping me get here, really truly, everyone. And to all you chefs, you guys are incredible, so keep on making great food, no matter what. But mostly, I want to say thank you to my grandfather, Matteo. He taught me how to make a sandwich and he, he always said that sandwiches are a lot like people. It's all about what they're made of. (upbeat instrumental music) (audience claps) Andy, Tessa, we did it! (slow instrumental music) - You did it. - I kind of think we both did. - Yeah, I'll go with that. - So, I'm gonna be opening a restaurant. So I think I'm gonna need a partner. - I might have 10 grand I can throw in. - Any chance you want to get back into the game? That is, if you're sticking around, of course. - I'm not going anywhere. (sweet instrumental music) - I'm here live casting at Sapore, Portland's newest edition to the food scene and we're here with head chef and co-owner, Cleo Morelli. Hey Cleo, from my live cast. - You're doing great. I gotta get back to work. - Okay, let's see what the customers think. - Real quick, you were gonna introduce me to Gabe's brother, right? - Yeah, he's really nice, has an amazing house, I just don't think he's gonna be your type. - Cleo! - I will, I promise. - Congratulations, by the way. It is my all time favorite restaurant. - Mom, Tim, oh you guys made it! - This is a nice looking place you got here. - So Ma, what do you think? - Well, I, I, it's perfect. I'm so very proud of you. And your grandfather would be too. Which reminds me. We wanted to get something special for you tonight. - Is this? - I found it in the back when I was helping you guys clean up. We thought you might like it. - I remember when this apron came right down to your toes. - I love you so much, thank you. - Our table's ready. - Oh great. - Hey, there you are! What is that? - Just an old family heirloom. - It suits you. So, how's the dream coming along? - It's exactly how I imagined. - Exactly? - Oh well, not exactly. There are a few details I didn't expect. - Yeah, like what? - You. - Where else would I be? This is my home. - Okay, okay, that's enough you guys. We're never gonna get this food out if you can't stop kissing. - Andy, what's the first rule in this kitchen? - I know, cook with love. - Okay. Okay, I got a tagliatelle on six and fire two chops. - [Andy] Firing! - [Cleo] And then a meatball parm to table seven!
