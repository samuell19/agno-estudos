THE TROJAN WOMEN Ten years. Ten times the seed was sown, before Troy falls, to perish by the Greek spears. Where there were desert cities and the blood falls from the holy temples. Meanwhile the Greek boats take possession of the Trojan treasure. Gold, a lot of gold, weapons, costumes ... torn from the dead. The wealth of Troia It was legendary. For years the Greeks looked east and they spoke of the barbaric threat. When Helena, Queen of Sparta, fled with Paris, leaving Menelaus they were already prepared. Oh! fools who collect the spoils of the city, you too will die for it. The screams mingle to the laments. Many captive women cry. Your lords raffled them each other. Some will go to Arcadia, others to the Treasury. Others, with the sons of Theseus, gentlemen of Athens. Other, excluded from the draw, will be of the great captains. With them, an exceptional prisoner: the Spartan Helena. Who has never seen a misfortune, Now you can see it. Hecuba lies here, by the gates. Lost your husband and your children. All dead. Get up Get up off the floor. Oh! Head tired! Oh! Mistreated neck. This is no longer Troia, no more your masters. Let's go. The path of destiny It is the way of the wind. Destiny and wind, both always drift. It's always nothing. Nothing ... always. They keep silence. Speak ... cry then. Why? What for? Oh! This sick body ... My back... Get up! Quick! I have to move. Rock my body about. At the sound of crying. At the sound of tears falling. Forever. Oh greeks, with your boats offshore from the dark sea ports you have come to our holy city bringing your noises of war. Why did you come? For a woman. What a shame, what a shame! For her died Priam, the king, father of my children. And dragged me to mine twilight of destruction. What am I? Waiting here for the words of a greek king. An old gray-haired woman who no longer has a home, a slave of clamor of a man. Oh wives of all heroes that lie dead here and maidens, children, terrified by shame. See? Only ashes left where was Troia. We will cry. - Why do you cry, Hecuba? - We're very scared. We pity you. Look ... where are the great Greek ships. - They are moving! - The sailors are at the bow! - What are you going to do? - Will you take us on the boats? Away from home! Do you think they'll kill us? They ask me and I know nothing, but I fear for the worst. - We will die. - They'll take us with them. "Whose slave will I be?" - Whose slave will I be? And I? A slave! From who? Where how? A poor old woman condemned for life. That you can no longer protect them. Just an image of what I was, a ghost. I will keep a lord's door. I will raise your children. Once I was Queen, in Troia. See! Someone is coming. A herald. It's coming from the port! - What will you say? - Oh gods ... It's time. Trojans, the Greeks prepare to leave. But not Cassandra, she does not. You are crazy. Got mad. Protect her. No shame before the Greeks. Not even in front of him. You know me, Hecuba, I brought messages from Greece to Troia. Talthybius. I bring news. It's arrived, Trojans, what we feared. The draws were made, if that's what they feared. - Sweepstakes? - One for each, only one. Who with whom? One on one! My daughter. Who takes her? Tell me. Cassandra King Agamemnon. To serve your wife? No, to your bed. Never. Performed the sacred vows and fulfill them all their lives. She will be his, but a virgin ... forever. He adored her. Even with this strange purity. The royal bed is not so bad like that. My other daughter. You took her last night. - Polyxena? - Herself. Who stayed with her? They left her to take care of Achilles title. Do you take care of a title? My daughter? What a strange ritual this is, my friend? You might consider her lucky and ... be thankful. Those words... Why do you talk like that? She is alive! It could be much worse. So she is free of problems. What about Hector's wife? My Hector. Where will she go ... Andromache? The son of Achilles stayed with her. Where is she? In the hands of the Greeks, arrested when running away with her son. And I? Old gray head. Whose will I be? Slave King Slave, Ulysses. Knock, hit my head. Scratch my enslaved faces! How can you be so vile? Wild and heartless torture, ruthless. Cry for me women of Troy! Cheating and impure It's my condemnation. Bring Cassandra here. Find her! We have to take her, along with all the others! Flames burn ... there! There's nothing burning. It's my daughter Cassandra. You are crazy. I have the fire, I have my torch. I touch the fire of this Holy place! Virtue. Virtue. Blessed the groom, blessed me, lying in the king's bed, in your bed in Argos. Mother cry for our lost homeland. I will be your wife. Let us raise this flame of glory, of splendor, of joy! Dance, dance without ceasing. Oh, blessed luck, dance for my dead father, My dead father. Let's dance for him. Stop her!

Honor my marriage. And honor that one too with whom fate It led me to share the bed. Child, give me that torch. Do not hold tightly and your walk is erratic. Your suffering, my child, It never brought you lucidity. Listening. This union does not deserve skeptics, only tears. Mother crown my triumph with flowers. Rejoice because I will marry a king. Send me to him and if I take too long take me violently. If there are still gods, my wedding will be bloodier than Helena's. Agamemnon the Great, glorious lord of Greece. I'll kill you, mom, pay for the death of my father and brothers. But I shouldn't talk about that. Not even the ax that will cut my neck and the others ... nor the murder of a mother perpetrated by their children. Comes. This city is happier than the Greeks, mother. I know I'm crazy, but listen to me. At least now, I'm not delirious They came looking for a woman ... Helena, and many were killed. Why? No one has attacked your borders nor besieged their cities. But the Greeks slaughtered in battle, will never see your children. Your women won't involve them in shrouds in their tombs. They lie in strange lands. And their houses are full of pain. Women who will die widows, old men who will wait for children that will never come back. That was the glorious victory. that have. But we gave our lives to save our people. No greater glory that is. Our dead returned by hands of friends and rest in their land, among yours, for all eternity. Unlike distant pain from the Greeks. And the pain of Hector, your Hector ... Mom, listen to me! Died like a hero, because the Greeks came. If not, we would not have known it. It is a certain truth that wisdom refuses war. But if it happens, the glorious death it will be that for the country. So, mother, don't cry by Troy or by me or for my marriage. Listening. For your madness, I will not take into account your grievances against Greece. May the wind carry them. Come to the ship now. I will never see my children again. My heart, buried here, no more beating again. The sky is dark, the sun is gone. The grass won't grow back. This land is ours, ours, has always been ours. This land is ours, ours, has always been ours. We will never abandon her, because our roots are in it. We will never abandon her, because our roots are in it. I will never see my children again. My heart, buried here, no more beating again. The sky is dark, the sun is gone. The grass won't grow back. This land is ours, ours, has always been ours. This land is ours, ours, has always been ours. We will never abandon her, because our roots are in it. We will never abandon her, because our roots are in it. Old woman, you stay here. You must wait for the time to go with Ulysses. Be a wise woman ... How they say. Come on, women! Let them take me! Soon you will see the groom and the bride In the house of death. I will not see my children anymore. Oh, Greek king, with your dreams of greatness in the future, stingy you are. And in darkness, everyone will be. And me, in the hills, washed by the winds of the storm that are close. L ... dead... expelled ... naked ... serving food to the beasts ... It's me, Myself. The servant of Apollo. Out, I don't want everyone these holy viruses. With my body still pure, I return them. - Let's go! - Soar the sails, the wind blows! Goodbye, dear city. Mother, my mother, don't cry. Brothers, may the earth keep them. Dad, I'll be with you soon. Leave me! The unwanted kindness and rudeness. I can't stand, I suffer too much. My God, I called you, but you didn't help me. I want to recode from better days, days when I was queen getting married with the king where I was his wife and that I bore him many children, good and brave all of them, the best of Troy. There can be no woman anymore proud of your children than me. I saw them fall under the Greek arrows. I cut my hair in front of your titles. And your father ... was not for the others I knew you should cry for him. I saw it with those eyes. I saw him die murdered at the altar when the city was taken. My daughters... Educated servants to marry kings. They took them. I raised them for the Greeks. This is the end, Old woman I'm going to Greece, I will open and close doors and I will bow my head. Poor Hector. Oh, daughter, did you know the grace It is the mystery of your god. How many lost charms with your virginity. And thou, Polyxena? Where are you? Why get up? What hope hold me? Never believe that the opulent are happy even in his death. A four wheel car brought the wooden horse to the gates. Golden and bright it was the reins. Deadly to your bowels. "Forward Troy", shouted the people. "Peace at last, the war is over." Bring the sculpture, offer an offering to God who gives us peace. - What young would have been lost? - What old would not have gone? Corners and rejoicing when opening the doors for that wooden horse that lies within the destruction of Troy. With strings of braided linen, a dark boat hull entered the city. We took him to the stone temple, through streets that would fill of blood. And we sang. The afternoon falls and still sounding Trojan music. The lights were on, No one slept. - A shout went through the city. - Left a river of blood. - A terrified boy ... - ... clings to your mother. And the war came out of hiding that the Greeks idealized. They slaughtered us at the altars. In the beds lie Headless men. Murdered youth in the bloom of age. That was the triumph of Greece. We generate children to suffer the pain and the shame of our homeland. She is Andromache. "It brings Hector's bond." - And it comes with Astyanax. Hector Oh, pain. Our pain. Why do you cry? The pain is mine. - Oh, gods. - Just mine. My noble children, lost ... - The pain has come. - For me. To town. It is a cloud of dust. Wait! No, my husband! It lies on the earth, My children were killed. - My husband! - My son! - Give me death. - Death - What a pain. - That's ours. Our city has fallen. Under these torments. By your son Paris, who left Troy To seek a forbidden love. Dead moms, bodies, blood ... It's all over. Mother of the one who killed with your spear Greek numbers, look around you. Treated like cattle, as the parts of the flock. My son and me. Impotence scares. Your men end up to take Cassandra. They snatched it from me. I pity you. What else happened? It lists all my woes. Each will be worse than the previous one. Polyxena is dead about the Achilles title, as an offering to the corpse. My pain. This is what Talthybius meant. I did not understand your words. - It was so sensitive. "I covered your body with my cloak." My daughter! My poor daughter, shamelessly murdered. Died without pity, happier than me, live. Death is nothing, in life there is hope. No, mom, not true. Dying will only cease to be. I prefer death to a life of bitterness. Your daughter is dead. It's like you've never been born. You don't know the evil that killed her. But I... I worked hard and succeeded reach the summit of happiness. And I lost her. I achieved all that in one woman considers herself a virtue. At Hector's house I have fulfilled my obligations. I was obedient. With silence and tranquility I have always served my husband. For it came to the Greeks to my misfortune. I will serve the son of Achilles, to those who killed ... Hector, my beloved! Should...? Do you think you should... give myself to my new husband and betray the dead? Or bore you and make you hate me? One night they say it's enough one night in the marital bed to satisfy a woman. Oh, Hector, my love... Always was noble, wise, brave and prosperous. No one had ever owned me before. You found me pure at the palace of my father and possessed me. You are dead. And I must go to Greece as a slave. And you cry for Polyxena? Does she suffer like me? To live hope is necessary. And I don't have it anymore. Those ships. I've never been to one, but I heard about them. When a storm surprises them, sailors work: one in the candles; another, in the helm... Everyone collaborates. But if the sea dominates them, kneel before the danger, surrender to the bravery of the waves. Like me laughing at myself, before my woes. The great divine wave beat me. Listen to me. Hector's Forgets And what happened. Your tears won't bring it back. Go and honor your lord. Use all your charms to seduce him. Do it and bring hope to your friends. Raises my son's son and you will be of great help to Troy. And if you have more children, may rebuild Troy, our beloved city. One idea leads me to another. Hector's Wife, the noblest from the men of Troy, You don't hate me. Although I don't want to, I must tell you something. - The Greeks have decided ... - What? Your words portend evil. That the boy ... You can't come with me with the same sir? This boy will never be slave of some greek. But... Leave here the last of the Trojans? Word cannot sweeten what I'll tell you. You're kind, but you do not bring good news. Your son must die, these are the terrible new ones! It was Ulysses's idea. Said the son of a hero should not grow. Will use the same criteria with your children? Will be thrown from walls of Troy! Let's go. Do not resist, will be better. Release him and face the pain with bravery. Don't ask for help, No one can help you. Think. Your city and your husband have fallen, You are alone. An abandoned woman! How to fight, How to protect it? Silence! Never curses the Greeks. If you say a word, the army rages. The boy will have no value. They will have no compassion. So accept fate as best you can. They will give you a worthy title. And they will be more accommodating to you. Die, son of my bowels. My treasure. They kill you because of your father's nobility. Saved others, But I can't save you. Because of your nobility. My bed, my news ... All reduced to misfortune. When I raised my son at Hector's house it was not to give it to the Greeks, but to reign. Do you cry? I'm sorry, son. C'mon C'mon... Do you happen to know what wait for you? Why do you cling to so much force on me? Little bird flies high under my wings. And Hector will not come. Will not come. Abandoning your title, It will save you with your hands. What will it be like? Shot from above. Terrible! Dying, with a broken neck And no one to help you. You, dead in my arms, My son, My dear boy. Your sweet smell. Oh! huge pain! Kiss me, let's go ... and hug me. Again, Give me another kiss. Oh greeks, discover new tortures that are not due. A boy, an innocent child. And they want to kill him. Hellenes, murderers of their parents. Madness, hate, death ... All the poison that the earth gives. May the gods curse them. This precious eyes led to ruin and shame to the fields of Troy. Fast. Catch him. Kill him and devour him The gods destroyed me and I can't ... I can't save My son of death. Hide my debased body and take me to your ship. Come on, boy. Leave her. Take the. A soldier with such orders You shouldn't have mercy. Not ashamed. Not like me. Water. Backwards, backwards! Water! Water. Water. - Menelaus, come quickly! - What happened? They want to kill Helena. I would like to see that. - Yes, only they would arrest me. "But they said they would kill her." - Helena to come back alive. Must be in the triumphal parade from the Greeks. - It's a bloody trophy. - Only pure gold. - That was what they wanted. - And she gave them the reason. Kill her, kill her! Thou ruler of the world, whose throne is in the highest, and to whom our understanding not reached. Who are you? God, need of what is due us, reason of our reason, where are you? I beg you, look the silent way which justice brings to all. Justice will be done. I brought my army to Troia, not for her, as you say, but for the one who was my guest and then stole it. And by the dese, He paid the price. He and all his homeland. Give me to kill her, or if I want to take her to Argos Kill her, Menelaus, if you do, you will be blessed. But avoid looking at it, the desire for her to blind you. She takes over the will of men with the look. In front of her, Men and cities succumb. From it comes fire that burns houses, Deadly magic. I know her, just like you and to all who have suffered. Catch her, get her out of there! - Kill her, kill her! - I need to kill her! Menelaus, these things can scare a woman. Your men ripped me off from my quarters. They put their hands upon me. You have not changed. Of course I do. I almost know. You hate me but still I ask you: what is your decision and Greece's? Will I live or not? Nothing more clear, The decision is unanime: you will die! Can I defend myself? I would show you that my death it would be unfair and innocent. - I came to kill you, not to hear you. - Listen to her. Should not die without being heard. So, Menelaus, Let me answer her. You ignore the evil you caused the Troy, so I will explain to you. Enough of that! If you wanna talk, Speak then. I admit for you, not for her, You can be sure of that. It may not matter if you believe I tell the truth. Don't even tell me for you consider me your enemy. Even so, I will try to answer what you would say if you expressed your feelings. I'm as guilty as you. First, who started it all? She. By giving birth to Paris. Who else is guilty? King Priam, who knew about his son's condition and let him go. To ruin Troy. And to me. I know what you think: why did I run away? Why did I run away in secret? This man, Paris, or whatever you want to call it, curse you. When he came to me, a powerful goddess accompanied him. Love. Aphrodite. Told me that he would be mine. And you, poor wretch, what have you done? You opened the doors for your guests. and you sent your ships to Crete. You left Sparta, You left him in your house. I don't ask you, but myself, what was in my heart to go with him. A stranger who I forgot My home, my homeland. Don't punish me, but Aphrodite, the most powerful of the gods, since it enslaves the heart. She my acquittal. So I went and look what happened. My abduction brought great luck for all of Greece. Dictators do not rule them, no strangers with their spears, Good for Greece, not for me, damned for my beauty. Accused of infamy when I deserve the crown. Let her finish. It would have been fair, say, that dying Paris Had I returned to Greece. I tried to do that. Many, many times. Liar! I have witnesses. The guards, the watchers, everyone. Oftentimes watched me leave the fortress, tied with ropes, Struggling to escape. The Trojans no longer wanted me and Deiphobus, the man who soon arrested me, the force never let me go. Husband, should i die? It is in your hands! Is that your justice? They forced me violently. I have lived an unfortunate life. Of pain. A life of bitterness. would as a painter erase the beauty of my face and have a vulgar face. Queen, defend your children and your homeland. These words are intolerable. The gods will applaud me who exposes your bankruptcies. Don't use the gods to wash away your fault. My son was a beautiful man. When you saw him, you wanted him no need of any goddess. You saw him in his shining costume and fell at his feet. And you thought, once free of Sparta in Troy where you believed that gold was abundant, could spend until nothing more left in the city. All your luxuries, your insolent excesses ... Menelaus's house was too small for them. You say it drove you to strength. You screamed. No one in Sparta heard anything. When you arrived, You brought the Greeks behind you. And the war, Death in battle. Wondering today's Greek victory. would have done that Menelaus face yourself with my son, whom he feared as a rival. Until then, Troy was invincible. Menelaus didn't mean nothing for you. You want to be on the winning side, isn't that right? As always. You say you tied yourself to ropes to get out. Has anyone seen you? Wouldn't you have a knife or a rope? That would use any woman decent in your situation. I said to you, Daughter, I will help you, I will send you in the Greek boats. For the end of this war. But you didn't listen and at home de Paris was insolent. You like to effect men. Look how you are dressed, Is this how you get a husband? Men should spit on you. Head down, humble, fearful and trembling. So you should be, ashamed instead of shamelessness for all the harm you did. Just one more word, king. Give a crown to Greece, Worthy of you. Kill her. - King, remember your lineage. - They say you're effeminate. Do what you must do. - Be strong - Be noble. - Punish her! "I agree with what you say." You left of your own accord, Aphrodite will not apologize for that. Go, your death is near, Don't dishonor me again. No, no. I get down on my knees and I beg you. It was the gods. For her, many of yours died. And children. - Don't betray them - Enough, old lady. You're nothing to me. The death in Troy not appropriate, I'll take her on my fastest ship and in Greece I will deliver it to the relatives of the dead. Take her to the ship and take care of her. Hopefully a lightning bolt of the gods fall on this ship and reduce it to ashes! A ship has already departed, Hecuba. In it travels Andromache, Mother of this boy. She wanted him to stay in your hands for you to cover him, if you still have any costume left He asked me to rest with this shield of Hector. And I will cover him with flowers. When you have done everything, we will embark. Let it be as fast as possible. Of a problem I freed you. I asked them to take him to the lake so that the water wash your wounds. I will dig your grave. If we do it together, we will go home quickly. Leave the shield on the floor. My son, what a horrible death. If you had fallen fighting, if you had been young, strong, beloved and with divine power ... You did not know happiness, if it exists. However... They threw you off the walls, my angel. Curl the hair curls that your mother caressed and where I kissed you. Your bones, broken and dented ... Dear hands, Just like your father's. Dear ones ... lips, closed forever. You always said beautiful things when you saw me. You always said to me: "Grandfather, when you die, I'll cut a lock of your hair to me and I will make my soldiers watch over your tomb! " And finally, it's me, a homeless candle and without offspring, who buries you. So young. An... unjust death. A poet could write in your title: "Here is a child to whom the Greeks feared and murdered. " The meter appears when the reason disappears. I give you everything I have, my son. Although you have not reached great exploits to the admiration of your companions, your father's mother deposits here these offerings and about everything that was yours, Put this flower on. This was the great prince from our city. I would have dressed you at your wedding, and the most beautiful princess of the East, you would have been your bride. With linen fabrics I cover your wounds. Fine words, even though they are useless among the dead. Your cock will take care of you. Let's go, bury him in his tomb. Never mind the dead your burial. It's pure vanity of ours, the living. Captains, you were commissioned burn this city! Quick, what your torches don't get still! Women, the sound of trumpet is the signal, go to the boats. Madam, my apologies to you. Let's go. Come on, don't stop them! They burn our city! Our city. Fast. The is burning. I have to hurry I must say goodbye to her. Get her and take care of her. Oh! Father, who gave us life, don't you see our suffering? Did we deserve this? - The flames light up the city. - The fire devours everything. Troy is disappearing, reduced to fire and smoke! Listen, your mother calls you. Dead are those who you talk to. Kneel with the members sore upon our land. - Mine are in this place. - Hubby, oh, my husband. Drag us out of our land. Pain, immense pain. -The people are down on us. - I can't see my house. Your name disappears from the earth, Troy goes extinct Forever. Did you hear? See? Troia has fallen! Earthquakes and floods. It is the end of the city. Get up, get up off the floor, mistreated body. Old trembling legs, should take me to a new day of slavery.
