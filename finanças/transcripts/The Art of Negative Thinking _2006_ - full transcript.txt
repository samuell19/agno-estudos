And I'm going to recommend groups like ours to the Minister of Health. Let's focus on one goal at a time. - Then I'll call the Minister. - Good. We search for and talk about what we believe in. Asbj?rn, your goal can be to find a gift for our new members. You can do that, Asbj?rn. Lillemor? - I think I have a blockage. - Want the shit bag? Fucking tiny apartment! It's so ugly. Those striped curtains. I hate being there. Excellent. What do you want to do about it? The doctors say I can't do anything. We have to focus on the solution. Not the problem. - Small changes lead to big changes. - Exactly. Let's conclude today's session with a focus exercise. The choice is ours. I choose the positive approach. THE ART OF NEGATIVE THINKING Did you remember my vegetables? Interested in a flatscreen TV? Hi-Def, two scart connections... You hungry? See you later. - Hi. I was just looking for something. Sorry. I have some incredible news for you. A publishing house called. They want our book. Congratulations! I told you so. They liked that you wanted to take part. Count me and Gard in! Maybe we should discuss our fee first. Sorry. That group is coming today. I want no part of them. We haven't even met them yet. I get more out of the obituaries than out of those bastards. License plate AD 68401. Hang on. Here's my license. Never mind. - Feel free to ticket us. - We don't care Because? - It's on the state! - Never mind. - Bye! - No problem. This is private property! Get lost! Are you Geirr? Go back to the welfare office! This isn't dangerous, Geirr. - Hi, Geirr! - Hi there. Are you all right? Don't do that! It isn't dangerous to inhale. Ingvild! Ingvild! They are not coming in here. I'm doing this for us. You should appreciate that. Focus on Geirr and Ingvild. - Hi. - Hi, Ingvild. What a lovely house! - Don't you dare let them in! - Come on in. Don't worry. It'll pass. Fucking handicapped assholes! I just have a sore neck. I don't want you here! Go back to the welfare office! Fucking handicapped bastards! Hi! Lmagine affording a house like this. Geirr had accident insurance. I have an idea... Doesn't this look delicious? Hey... Let me talk to Geirr. I'm sure he'll come down. I think we should leave him alone for a while. You know what? Tonight you only have to think about yourself. Leave your problems to me. How about a tour of the house? Of course Artwork... And there's your family. We have such a wonderful time together, this group. Hi, Geirr. I've been looking forward to meeting you. - You have good taste in films. - Shut up! I'm trying to watch this. Do you like Johnny Cash too? He's fantastic. How does that song go? Desperado, why don't you... And all those albums he relased just before he died? Don't act like you're something You're not! That won't work in here. We're here to help the two of you, Geirr. Understand? You aren't the only one who's been struggling since the accident. Ingvild isn't in a great place either. Hasn't she told you that she's considering leaving you? We can do something about that, Geirr. Take your time. We'll be waiting for you downstairs. Geirr! Geirr... Geirr! I didn't mean to go behind your back, but I was at a loss. - There's nothing we can do. - I'm stuck here. Just come to the meeting, Geirr Want me to call a cab? OK. I'll go become a heroin addict. You can find a new lover, and I'll find some junkie that We both need help, Geirr. Calm down. Can't you just calm down, Geirr? Christ! I don't need help from some grinning asshole! And when we open our eyes, we will radiate Joy of life and zeal. Knock it off! Geirr, we are very glad that you have chosen to join our He loves giving gifts. He means well. It's always sleazy underwear. You're such a flirt, Asbj?rn! Geirr is a very interesting person. He likes movies, is interested in culture, collects records... You seem to have a very exciting personality, Geirr. Asbj?rn likes your boots. Lillemor, do you have anything to add? I like your hair. No, you don't. And yours looks like hell. Let's tell Geirr and Ingvild about our new plans. The whole group is going to Lanzarote. You can come if you want. Geirr, we know that you are in a bad place. But you must have experienced something positive... I am paralyzed and impotent. No, I don't consider that very positive. Maybe we should let Geirr borrow the shit bag. The shit bag can take all kinds of difficult emotions. Just tell the shit bag what you find difficult, Geirr. Christ... You seem to have a lot of pent up aggression. That isn't surprising at all. But this works. No matter what happens, think positive. Think positive. Are you all right? Help him, Asbj?rn. If you think your life sucks, look at Asbj?rn. I don't like vegetables. Asbj?rn is perfectly lucid. He's known more hardship than you. Congratulations, Asbj?rn That's great. Asbj?rn owned his own company. He was swindled, and went broke. He can't even wipe his own rear. Then his wife married his brother. After repeated suicide attempts he was kicked out of the rest home. Today he lives at a shelter where junkies steal everything he owns. You needed to hear it, Asbj?rn! Thank you. That was touching. Powerful and tragic. I give it a six out of six. Thank you. That's how it usually is to begin with. But then you learn how to think. I understand why you don't want to take part. - I'm going up to watch a movie. - Hm? I'm going up to watch a movie! Are you coming with me? Can I do it again? Pretty please? Just one more time up and down? You should try this, Lillemor! Up and down. But not too fast! Want to come? Want to go for a ride? There. You want to go faster? My love. That looks like fun, Ingvild, but we've wasted enough time. Lillemor, are you coming? She has been very successful. I like being with others. Quite a group you've found yourself. And I love my job. Whores say the same thing. I wouldn't know about that. No, you don't seem to be the saltiest nut in the bag. Your turn, Geirr. Start by mentioning something specific you like to do. If you can. I'm waiting, Geirr. I like watching movies. Movies... That sounds dismal. Sitting alone in the dark watching a movie while everyone else is at work, hanging out with friends... Are you aware that you are about to lose your girlfriend, Geirr? I want you all to feel the discomfort of a negative attitude. Maybe you should apologize. May I have a word with you? Sure, pity the wheelchair-bound. You for once just shut... Do you have to degrade them? When we first came here, Geirr was up in his room, yelling and screaming. Now he is sitting in there. Interacting with others. More has happened in two hours than in two years! Isn't that fantastic? He's only gotten worse. Don't break him down with your negative focus. Your compassion and understanding has only made him weaker. Leave the therapeutic responsibility to me. I have the proper background. You focus on your own challenges. Stop hiding behind your martyr role, Ingvild. Sorry. We don't use the word "sorry" in our solution-oriented method. Start looking forward, and do things differently next time. Don't take it like that. Everything will work outjust fine. Let's take a break now. And turn this into something nice and positive. Cheers, everyone! Wine would have been nice. Save your wine-drinking and couch-puking for home. Anyone want to hear a story? Not thatjoke about the Norwegian, Swede, and Dane, I hope. This really is good, Marte. I know, but I'm on a diet. - But you have a lovely figure. - You think so? I've gone down five kilos in two weeks. Gard prefers skinny women. You have to eat, even though you're in a wheelchair. Eat, you crazy girl. What is your problem? What would you know, with your villa and piles of cash? So a neck brace is worse than a wheelchair? Let's not... Don't tell us what we can talk about! I want to talk about my problems! I may not be handicapped, but there are worse problems than wheelchairs. I'd trade your miserable life for two healthy legs in a heartbeat. That's enough, Geirr. Let's not argue about who has the worst life. - Cut the bullshit! - We want this clarified! Ingvild, get Gard. Why? And bring pen and paper. What are you doing here? Sorry. I just had to get away. They're waiting for us downstairs. Is it true that you're planning on leaving Geirr? The thought can cross your mind Now and then, can't it? It's all my fault. It was my fault that she fell. I was supposed to secure the rope. No... I didn't mean to interrupt. We were just talking. It's OK. I won't tell anyone. We were just talking! The three of us have to stick together. We can't risk losing everything because of Geirr's frustration. Gard and I are best off, Geirr worst. He's most negative. This is about who's worst off, not who's most negative! What's the difference? I have Gard in last place. He has a job, a car, and a nice apartment. And he isn't physically handicapped. Then we have Ingvild, With job, car, and house. But Geirr is a worse partner than Marte. Geirr is handicapped, but has a nice house and girlfriend. I have Marte in first place, and me in a solid second. You put yourself in second? I'm so depressed! Sorry, Lillemor, that won't do. I'm not worst off! And you forgot about Asbj?rn. We know nothing about him. Your turn, Asbj?rn. Marte is worse off than Gard. And Lillemor? Exactly! How about me? You don't understand shit! You... aren't... alone. We can say you're worst off. He's just a sore loser. Relax. It was just a fork. You're spoiling this for everyone. I just wanted it clarified. What? I shouldn't have invited them. Now I know you can only associate with yourself. I'm not the only one who gets nothing out of Tori's bullshit. And you wonder why we can't stand being with you? Ingvild! Geirr should be here. Isn't he part of the group? We need the rest of this meeting to focus on you. That's for next time. We can't be here without Geirr. Should we cancel that Lanzarote trip? I'm willing to try harder. Good, Marte. But I wasn't thinking about you. Fine. We can stay. Really? Fine. Let's continue in the living room. Can I help you? That's enough! Asbj?rn! Lmagine that you wake up, - - and everything has changed. Your dreams have come true. - Is this part of your therapy? - This is the miracle technique. Open your eyes and write down what you have seen. Lecturer. Great, Marte! Asbj?rn? "Want to go to Lanzarote. " Interior designer? Write whatever you want. I can't do anything anyway. I think everyone here is tired of you constantly airing your petty problems. It's time you learned the difference between mental and physical problems. To hold your own head up. I don't think I've ever seen a group with as much potential as this one. Seriously. So I have hatched a proper pedagogical plan. You'd better watch yourself. A lovely dress. Face it, people, we aren't here because we have dandruff. A little party. Why not? You and me and Johnny Cash. Look at me! Everyone go pack your things. I said go pack your things! You can't make us anymore. Shut the fuck up! Your problem isn't that you're stuck in a wheelchair, but that you're too pathetic to deal with it! And you're so depressed. Take some responsibility, you old bag! And you... Now we're getting somewhere. That's positive, Tori. Are you just going to leave? I said are you just leaving? Tell them I'll wait in the car. They have five minutes, unless they want to manage on their own. Fine, leave. All that matters to you is getting your book published. You should be above a statement like that, Gard. Time to wrap things up. Sorry, Gard. I'm in charge now. That's enough, Geirr. They're worried we'll become winos. You're ruining it for the group. You don't even have a problem. I don't want you here anymore. Tori is waiting outside. Raise your hand if you want those without problems to leave. It's good not everyone's arms are paralyzed, Gard. Gin and tonic? Hi, Geirr. I got a little hungry. Are you hurt? Not at all. I'm fine. Don't touch me. Let me know if you change your mind. OK. When the Vikings suffered a defeat, they drowned their sorrows in booze. Asbj?rn, my man... Cheers. Why haven't you spoken before, Asbj?rn? I was pissed off. OK. Here's to... Here's to Asbj?rn. The toughest man here tonight. Here's to you. And to you. Here's to old housewives in tiny apartments. You're completely clueless! Stop lying to yourself! At least we share the same bed, unlike you! She looks totally sick, Gard! Your boyfriend's future isn't exactly bright! That smile of hers will lead her to a mental ward. Within one year he'll be a junkie! That isn't my problem! Think I plan on dragging Marte around for the rest of my life? It's amazing how negative this group makes you. Where is Marte, anyway? I have to talk to Geirr. This will be a good exchange. Two antidepressants for one Rohypnol. I'm not giving you anything! Five of mine for one tiny Rohypnol. When did you become such a prude? You shouldn't mix drugs. Asbj?rn, do you have any real strong medication? Are you out of your mind?! - Do they work fast? - Stay away from my pills! I'll be right back. What's happened to you? Where have you been? I thought you had left me. Marte... We need to talk. Why? Why, Gard? Why? I don'tjust mean how you've been acting tonight. We're in the middle of a discussion. We have to share this. Are you all right, Marte? Let me do this, Ingvild. Geirr and Marte. I'm sure it won't come as a complete surprise to you - that we can no longer accept your behavior. And vice versa. I'm sure you have had the same thought. That our respective relationships - - are not necessarily the best long-term solution. Don't exaggerate, Gard. That is why I have a question for the two of you. Do you have any suggestions as to how to solve - this inequality? What are you doing, Gard? It's time we clarify this. I see two alternatives. One is to continue as before, where neither person is happy. The other... Is that you accept - that Ingvild and I - - break up and leave the group. Separately. Well done, Gard! You misunderstood, Geirr! You're the one that I want, but you can't keep rejecting me! I can never have sex with you again. And that's something you enjoy. So stop lying to my face. My love. I don't like women who are into cripples. You're so stupid. Why don't you just leave? Go get yourself a good fuck! This is so hard. I feel so incredibly guilty. Anyone up for a gin and tonic? Get lost, you fucking bitch! You self-centered, selfish bastard! Look what you've done! I'm a monster! If you hadn't been so focused on yourjob - and your hair and your fucking tan, - you may have remembered to secure that goddam rope! When we have sex I have to pretend I don't hate it - so that it will be better for you! Shame on you! Shame on you for leaving me alone while you work every night. And for fucking your secretary - - and coming home with fingers smelling of pussy! And for not wanting your friends to see me! And for not realizing how much I hate you! I hate you! And that self-pitying expression of yours. You're right, but... I hate you! But I simply refuse to put up with this. I hate you... I refuse to put up with this. I'm serious. - No! It's over! How are you doing, Marte? Marte is on the porch and refuses to speak. Do you like music too? This is Johnny Cash. You think I'm fucking with you? I've never been much interested in ... cowboys. But I love listening to Johnny Cash. Tell Marte I'll be down. Ok. Have you ever been to a good nursing home? She'd be much better off there than with me. Would you please leave me alone? How's it feel to be single again? Think of the possibilities. You have it all, with the exception of brains, looks, and a personality. My husband went broke and found a younger woman. And I had to move into a tiny apartment. Now I'm on pain medication and welfare. And I'm all alone. I miss my family, Asbj?rn. Why don't they want to see me? I don't want to spend the rest of my life alone. Who will take care of me when I get sick? Do you think... Do you think that you could love me, Asbj?rn? We can't give up now, Marte. Fuck them. Fuck them all. Were you like this before? Like what? Did you just sit inside and hate everything? I was happy, content, and stupid. I was almost always happy. And it was perfectly natural. Now everyone just thinks I'm naive and stupid. I don't think so. I want to show you something. Lovely Lillemor. Am I lovely? I'm miserable enough as it is! Come here, buddy! Come on! You have a dog, too? It lives here in the woods. Somebody probably got tired of it and dumped it here to die. But this little bastard doesn't give up that easy, Marte. All right. Let go. That's enough! Go back! That's an indoor dog. But it survived the entire winter out there. Animals like that should be put to sleep. How did I end up with you? I'm used to associating with healthy, normal people. Sure, but they want nothing to do with you. I want things to go back to the way they were. We aren't here to reminisce. Then why are we here? Why are we here, Marte? - Fuck them. - Are we fucking someone? Those cocks that always smile on TV. Fuck everyone with friends and family. Fuck everyone who has their life ahead of them. Fuck everyone who feels sorry for you. And those who know nothing. Every asshole who thinks there's something worth celebrating. Fuck them, fuck you, and fuck me! You don't know how my life is. I can't take any more. Poor you. Why not throw yourself in front of a truck? It isn't far enough down, Gard! Think I'm afraid to relax in a wheelchair from now on? That's all they do, you know! Jump then! Did you say something? Gard? Are you all right? Yes, I think so. This is a Sunnaas Spliff. I named it after my rehab hospital. This is like a hot dog for the brain. Is it good, Marte? There's a man who knows how to smoke! It's nice to just sit here and relax. Is that Marte's real laugh? They're having more fun than us. I can feel my legs. I can feel my legs! I can feel them, Geir. I can feel my body again. Lillemor, I can feel my legs! I can feel my body! Stop it, Marte. I can feel... - Marte! Calm down. - I can feel it! You can't start feeling your legs just because you smoked some pot. Why are you looking at me like that? I don't want anything to do with you! I'm not some simple hooker! Don't look at me like that! Look somewhere else! I come from a good family. If you have come to dampen the mood... Sorry. I never want to see you again. - Fuck you! - What did you say? I agree, Asbj?rn. You aren't making me feel guilty. Bravo! This is your fault. Yes, it is. I am getting sick and tired of... You are in serious... Shoot him in the leg, Geirr! Shoot his legs! It's time you learned what our life is like. Stop right now, or I'll go upstairs and start packing. And I'll order a taxi for everyone. This party has just started. Then I'll start packing. Go ahead. Come back tomorrow when you realize you're too spineless. And too guilt-ridden. Fine. You coming, Gard? I don't want any chickens backing out here! Turn on the lights. Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! You have to come back and fix this, Tori. This is your group. I don't run some 24-hour hotline. You can't screw everything up, and then call when you're sorry. I work for the state. There are limits to how many chances you get. Fine. Then it's your responsibility if people start killing themselves! Why are you looking at me like that? Weren't you going to start packing? We shouldn't have cut the power. It will just make Geirr more angry. Have any of you noticed how annoying wedding photos can be? You can continue with those. The Man Who Loved Life A Biography of Van Gogh. Bullshit! He killed himself, for Christ's sake! I can't leave while they're carrying on like that. They're just trying to make us feel guilty. We've done everything we could. If we don't leave now, they'll never understand that we're serious. Bastard! This isn't our responsibility. We deserve so much more. We do. Lillemor! Not the stereo. Come on, goddammit! Come on! I think they heard that. I bought this from my drug-addicted neighbor. Suicide Poison. I can't feel a thing. Any of you heard of Russian roulette? Wasn't it good for you? Why can't you just shut up? Sometimes - it's important to fight. But this time, the battle is lost. Not all lives are worth suffering through. No, hold it against your temple. No, there's room... Maybe we should stop calling them "meetings"? Parties! Good suggestion, Asbj?rn. Maybe we could invite others? This has been such a success. - Hi, Tori! - Hi. You want some cake? I've decided to give you another chance. Sometimes the human aspect comes before the principles. Enough already. Come have some cake. Thank you. How are you doing, Tori? I just wanted to help you. And you've done a greatjob. Feel free to call us if you want help with your book. You see, Tori... You'll never solve any of your problems - until you learn the art of negative thinking. Ingvild... My love.
