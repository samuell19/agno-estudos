We need every cent we can get. We're broke. Dad look at us. We're a couple of bums. Bums dad. [car door slams] Dad, look I'm sorry, all right? But someone is offering us a ranch here. A ranch. It must be worth a lot of money. It might be. Wasn't much of a place. Hell we can sell it if we don't want it. Yeah, I suppose. Got enough money for gas? Yeah I think so. Lord love a duck, I gotta be out of my mind. [music playing] MAN IN SUIT: So, I guess you were pretty anxious to get out here, aye? JOSH: My son was.

If you want to go inside,we can get this done now. Well I'm sorry to tell you thatthere's a few bills to see to. There's a hundred head of cattle that have been fed and kept in your absence.

I mean, the economy's not good,but there's always something. Look I'd be happy to buy the cattle from you it it would help. If you're thinking of selling, you'll have to apply for achange to the will estate. That means you'll have to convince a judge that yourintentions are in the best interest of your son. And that can take a while. Well, it's been a pleasure. Thanks for coming down. Good luck. Thanks. We don't have to sell, do we dad? Well, he was telling me thata lot of farms up for sale, land prices are way down. I don't think we get too much. I guess we have no choice then, aye? Guess not. I'll unpack.
