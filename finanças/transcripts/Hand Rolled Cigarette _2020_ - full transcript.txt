Further down to the level of 7.173. Today's market atmosphere is tense again. Is the market outlook optimistic or not? Is it entering a rampant pattern? Or look at the downward trend? My opinion is that after opening lower and the market crash last Friday, in fact, the overall trend of Hong Kong stocks is weak. There has been a slight rebound in the past two days, it has already given up today. For the time being, the trend is mainly to weaken. See if we can consolidate at 23000. The news comes out. Poor market response. It may has the opportunity to test the low of 22500 points. After all, the current situation is not clear. Those cigarettes have gone stale. Let's analyze the uncertain factors, and focus on Sino-U.S. relations. How long will the stock market be trapped by local factors? Big firms are less optimistic. The latest review is from Bank of America an it is pessimistic. Indeed, these political market conditions are more volatile. The two sessions will close soon. Trump threatened to introduce specific sanctions details last night. I need to go toilet. Worried about the deterioration of Sino-U.S. relations... What happened? A fight? I have to meet the teacher at school… Thank you miss. Did Kapil call you? I have to go. What about my money? I won't stop you from getting yourself killed. Something's happened. - Something serious? - My young brother got in a fight. You've got minions out there? My real young brother. Can you help me, sir? - Please. - I barely know you. Please, sir. Are you Mansu? You brother asked me to come. Mani. And you are? I'm his parent. Parent? I'm his relative. Mansu beat up two kids at the school concession stand. We weren't fighting. We just had body contact. It wasn't your first time. Apologize to your teacher. The school is considering expelling him. It's not that serious. Don't blow this out of proportion. Go on. Say sorry for your trouble. As you can see, he won't get along with other students. - The other kids fear him. - How about this? If he won't change his ways, I'll bring his big brother here. Then you can do whatever you want with him. - Sir! - It's minimal force. It's fine. - Apologize. - I'm sorry... - Say it! - I'm sorry... - I can't hear you! - Sorry. - To whom? Sorry, miss. Hear that? Let's go! What matters most... is whether you fear him. The other kids... Who cares? Sir, you can't talk like that. Goddamn brat. You think you're tough? Stop it! You people don't deserve my help. I'm not afraid of you. I'm afraid of you, all right? The whole world's afraid of you. Swim your way back to your country. Or just be a beggar. - I want to see my brother. - He doesn't want to see you. What do you have to say to him? They won't play with me. That's why I hit them. You dummy. The more you fight them, the less they want to play with you. Let's go. Look at yourself. You got snot covering your mouth and now you can't speak. Are you coming? One, two, three! Hey! This is payback. - I want naan. - Order it yourself. Uncle! Naan, please. OK. - Get me a milk tea. - And a milk tea. OK. Where are your parents? It's just for a few days. What about his mother? I'm not his father. It's just for a few days. A few days! Fine. Hey! Hey! - Do whatever this lady says. - OK. - Don't let him wander outside. - Sure. No! No! No! No! Let me go! What did the teacher say? He can stay in school. He's not answering the phone. Can you stop tapping your foot? Tell me where Mansu is. He's safe. I think it's a heat stroke. But it'll get cold in the water. What if it catches a cold? It's a cold-blooded animal! What have you done in school? It says here we should use electrolytes... Fatty! When will my fish tank get delivered? Told you in few days. Can't wait? Hundred and fifty dollars. Why that much? The shop at the corner sells it at $90. You know him. Why didn't you tell me? $90 Tofu is getting married. Thanks, Wood. Stop messing with it. It costs way more than you can afford. Now can you tell me where Mansu is? How many relatives do you have? Just Mansu and Kapil. He's doing an apprenticeship with my friend. Really? - What is he learning? - Nothing illegal. Mansu's a smart kid. No one taught him cricket. He picked it up on his own. I want him to join a school team. That's wishful thinking. How do you know he'll get in? I'll get him into university. He's really your brother by blood? Yes. Why are you so dorky? Change into this. - What's up, Boss Tai? - Come clean up your mess. - What mess? - Your bald turtle. Hey! Boss Tai. Just arrived? This way. Find his cousin! He gave me a bunch of dead turtles. What am I supposed to do? I told them! There's risk in transporting them! Refund his money. You are telling the same damn thing I said before. What the hell do I need you for? Look at your buddy... Are you in cahoots? - That is no guarantee! - What did you say?! Listen to me. Ship another batch over! Who says that I have to take it? Refund the deposit. - Double it. - Triple! You hear that? Otherwise, you won't make it back to Taiwan. That's all the mercy Boss Tai can spare. You hear me? Asshole! Are you nuts? Boss Tai! Son of a bitch! Go to hell! Do you think I don't understand Mandarin? I grew up with Shaw Brothers movies! The fortune teller said... there'd be blood this year. What about the money? He's dead. What can I do? I did this for you. Don't I deserve compensation? - I haven't gotten a cent from you. - Great. Then deduct your commission. - Leave! - What's wrong? Get the hell out! I don't have time to fool around! Leave! What's going on, sir? Leave! What did I do? What did I do?! Sir… Hey Wah. - What's the matter? - I need your help. We're at Wood's shop. Come over. Tofu is getting married. Sir… What happened? Stay away! - Don't get angry... - I don't want to hear your voice! Next turn is Wah. Come on. You couldn't shoot on the target after years. Awesome!

People die when he's in trouble. I'll call you later. Tofu... We're all old friends here. Why don't you invite him to the wedding? If you want to invite him, put on your own wedding. Sir... It's me. Mani! Sir! Open the door please. I left something important here. It's not mine! - The bag's not mine! - It's not yours?! - Trust me! - It's not mine! - It's not yours?! I didn't mean to lie to you. It's Kapil's bag! You bastard! I didn't mean to lie. The money I owe you... I'll work... and pay you bit by bit. Did Kapil call you? He's dead! I saw his corpse myself. Bastard! - Don't joke about that. - You think I'm joking? Your brother's at this address. Go find him. Bastard! - Did those guys kill him? - Get out of here! - What do we do? - There's no "we". It's just you! I don't know who I can trust. Everyone's shit. Nothing good. - Can I do anything to help you? - With what? I'm over a million dollars in debt! How can I supposed to get it?
