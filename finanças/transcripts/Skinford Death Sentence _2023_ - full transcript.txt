Thank God, for that. I mean, it's absolutely wonderful. - Shall we go straight to the shops. - Dig a big, nice hole. What? What are you mad about? I'm the one who should be shaking. I don't understand why we stick... at this tradition. Look at it. A hell of a job, huh? - Can't you see I have a gun? - Yes, but just so you know... We can speak clearly. I don't blame you for any of this. I bet it's part of the job... - You're one hell of a thief, Skinny. - Yes, but I'm damn good at it I ransacked Kovak's entire stock once. Then I sold it back to them, without them understanding anything. Skinny, who do you think sent me to kill you? It would be great to know. I've been trying to figure it out all the way here. Was it Kovak's, or was it Falkov's? Everyone wants to see you dead. I also. Now just dig the hole. - What is it? - That's enough. Wait. I think there's someone down there. What the...! Oh my God! Hello? Are you okay? Of... Hello! The lady! You, I have a bli. I'll drive you wherever you want. Here we go. No, you can't... He can't drive. Wait! Who are you? - You wouldn't have dug me up. - I would not? Excuse. I didn't realize that someone was buried alive in the hole I dug for myself. You were buried alive. Forgive me. My name is Jimmy Skinford. My friends call me Skinny. Hello! - Who was your friend in the hole? - What? No one special. Some guy Kovaks hired to kill me. How long had you been there? How long had you been in the ground? Listen! He shot me. You heard that, right? He shot me... and I have no marks. I do not understand anything. Listen... Maybe he missed? Maybe my time has not come? Maybe I'm meant for something big? - I don't actually know... - 'Something big'? Yes... something big. Something... I do not know. Something better. I've cheated death for quite some time, but this is too much. It is as if death no longer exists. Tell that to your buddy in the hole. Ut! What the hell! I think... that you are my new bestie. THREE DAYS EARLIER She says she's moving. No explanation whatsoever. Did she get a scholarship or something? She needs to think about her priorities. Such decisions affect both of you. Why doesn't she understand what you have together is very special. Today's women... They don't accept love for what it is. - It's heartbreaking. - Exactly... That's what I said. - Can I have her mobile number? - What are you saying? I take better care of her than you do. Oh, jeez! Lucinda. How beautiful you are. You don't decorate enough for this. - How much time do we have? - They are pumped full of Viagra... - A herd of buffalo, you know. - Erectile dysfunction. - You probably meant a herd. - What, herd? A herd of buffaloes. Collective noun, you know. - It does not matter. - See you next week then, handsome. Right? What? Excuse me! - She's a nightmare, mate. - She likes you. I could have told you that. What are you doing man? I've got it. He decorates well for the load. You and I split 60-40, as we agreed. - What, 60-40? - Jeez, you're a badass at negotiating. 50-50, okay? Minus the finder's pay. RAY'S CAR RENTAL The deal is done, Skinny. Out of the car. Vi ses, Skinny. What are you doing? Where is my colleague? Skeazy, it's me. I got a little busy. Did you get the money? Of course I'm alive. What happened to you? Okay. Can we talk when I pick up my share. I'm freezing out here. It doesn't take that long. I'm standing in a phone booth. I have to see dad on the way. Yes, okay. See ya. Bye. - Stop! - What? - You have two hands. - Sorry, is this difficult for you? Come on. Dad, are you awake? James? Min son. Come in. I wasn't expecting you tonight. - How are you? - How do I feel? That is the problem. It says that when you die, you slip away. I feel everything. But, I have Emma. She is an angel. - He's not cocky towards you, Emma. - Slightly. Are you going to introduce your adorable friend? Certainly. It's a friend of Skeazy's. You remember right, Edward? - Yes. - I work with him. I can pay for future treatments. It would have been more timely last week. You will be fine. I can't stay. I have to work. - What is going on? - He needs rest, Skinny. - What are you doing? - Out. Does he know you're a criminal? He knows he is dying. Do you know that? When we get to Skeazy, I'll pay you. Five percent. How nice of you. It's everything I dreamed of. Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do. I didn't want to be kidnapped and forced to dig my own grave. Now we give each other some opportunities. I am not interested in your possibilities. I guess you didn't have much going for you in that hole. And then you pulled me out of the fire, so we're even. Oh my God. I have to keep you. Ni, ni, ni... What kind of people are you? Oh, I don't feel anything. Put it down there. Didn't you see that? You stole my truck. If I'm going to die, so will you. It's not my fault you got into this predicament. Your presence at an invitation is desirable. How nice, sir. We keep you company. I'm starving. Hang on. Are you eating? Is everything there, honey? This was delicious, Mr. Falkov. Yes I know. I really appreciate you being so understanding. Sometimes you get into it. - Do you cook? - Excuse me? Do you cook? If called to heat a can of beans for cooking. A recipe is to be bound to a plan all the way until the task is solved. Every step is there...planned. - All you have to do is follow it. - Exactly. But if you skip a step. If you think you can cook a meal without following the instructions. Then you will fail. It is important that there is some intuition involved. But you have to respect the rules to know when to break them. Mr Falkov... I thought... Don't like the meal? - I really do, sir. - Eat, then! It was a mistake, Mr. Falkov. It will not happen again. James Skinford, sir. Say, Skinny. Only dad calls me James. - James sold us the truck. - Of course, the truck. Kovaks is after him too. - And the girl? - No clue. This looks amazing. Is it pork? I don't eat pork. Pigs are very intelligent. I switch to it. - Do you know why you are here? - I'm here to eat steak, sir. Three days ago you delivered something to me. - Did I? - A truck. Was it three days ago? I must have been a bit confused. Someone tried to kill me, but apparently it didn't work. It's a little too raw for me. Are you satisfied with the truck? Not at all. I paid for a product. It was supposed to be in the cargo, but unfortunately not. Technically, I was taken behind the light. Yes, but technically I have not received my compensation. So I have not been paid for a product that was not in the car. I don't even know what was there. Now that said, I want to clear my name. So this is what I can do for you. I can fix the delivery back unless you have some clever way to speed up the process, which is unlikely. So the real question is… - Why are you wasting my time? - We have our rules. Let me tell you something, Mr. Falkov. - Jeez! - Nikon. - Zophia. - That's enough. Take the truck as far away as you can and burn it. Fix my delivery here. Then I consider our agreement concluded. Beautiful girl, Zophia. Zophia, will you? How long have you and Polaroid been friends? - I have never met her. - She is wonderful. A bit intense. - How does she know you? - I do not know. - But I want to know that. - A mystery to solve. I am with. You are not included. You must stay out. - You are already living on borrowed time. - That talk is wasted on me. Where you go, I go. Or what, Zo? I like this. - You're not going to burn the truck, are you? - We await that opportunity. I wonder what's back there. Falkov will not reveal anything. But there is always a possibility. You were right. They are not very smart. Give it to me. - It was actually really good. - We'll take a look back there. A WEEK EARLIER I am a simple girl. You don't have to put in that much effort. Come on, this is a special place. - I only bring real hotties here. - Jeez. Thanks. - I have a job. - What? A real job? - Or a job? - A job with Skeazy. - It's well paid. - The bubbling puck. He's handsome, actually. You should be nice to him. You don't want to be covered in his shit. There are honest ways to make money. Maybe, but not here. That's why I'm moving. - What did you say? - I have received the scholarship. - I can fly there too. - Can you fly there? Where are you going to fly? To Berlin. I have told you about it. Yes of course. Jaya, that's great. I mean it. I'm happy for you. Are you? Jaya? - What was that about? - We don't have time for this. The girls are fucked. Let's go. - Jaya? - You bastard! You owe me two pieces of paper. - I knew it was you. Are you okay? - I have been better. - Why are you in a truck? - Because your girl closed the door, puck! She's not my girl. Can you hear me, Jaya? She's not my girl! There is nothing of value there. - Jaya? - Let us out of here! I open the door, but don't come out screaming. People are looking for us. You fucking dick. We wouldn't use those because they give a rash. - Normally, yes. It's not like... - I'll tell you how it is. So nice to see you, Jaya. It is quiet. It's my ex. We have to lay low until they blow off the search. - You can forget that, puck. - We probably got off to a bit of a bad start. You, thanks for the lift, but now I'm going my own way. I'm going to pull from this damn truck. They're looking for us out there. You won't get very far. I'm not going to let those bastards get to me again. - It's safer here. - I don't blame her. I don't want to be in this pile of shit either. What has happened? How did you end up in the truck? - First. - Do you remember the job with Skeazy? - I thought I had weapons in the cargo. - You... You told me about the job. That would solve all the problems. So I was the job. - Jaya, I didn't know... - This is not true. And her, then? That's my insurance. It covers everything. Sure, sörru. She's still too pretty for you. Kim was drugged. In the same club as me. Sam thought she was going on a date with a guy she met online. Damn Tinder. It's disgusting. - Why did they take you? - Trafficking. But I thought that kind of thing only happened in Turkey, sort of. Would they take us to Turkey? Who cares? Now I'm free anyway. I have my own plans. This is not going to end well. - It doesn't help them if we pretend. - She's not wrong. They have put something in us. What do you mean? We all have those. The procedure was not exactly hygienic. - You need care. The wound is open. - You do not say? Oh, damn. - They won't make it to the hospital. - Can't you cure them? It doesn't work that way. I can stop the pain and the progress. But as soon as we break contact, it comes back. Like a pause button, then? It's not their fault. And? Please... Whatever you did... it burns. My insides are on fire. I need your help. And? I know where the girls are. I know where the rest of the girls are. So, Jaya. And? This thing the Berlin thing. - Damn, we have to get out of here. - I sit at the back with the girls. You drive. - You must remove the handcuffs. - You are not leaving my side. - I drive. - I want you to sit with Zophia. - She can help you. - Nobody knows this place better than I do. - Do you remember I taught you. - Sharpen up and let me get us out of here. Jaya! I have changed... A beer, when we're done. Fan! Hang in there! Forgive me. I had nowhere else to go. It hurts so much. Can you make it stop? Where are they? Hang in there! Hell! When I was a young girl I sought pleasure When I was a young girl I drank beer Directly from the brewery into an institution Straight from the dance and into a cell Come mom, come dad and sit next to me Come mother, come father and pity me My heart aches, it is crushed by the pain My body it is freed and hell is my home - I'm so glad you came to play. - Do you help me? - What do they do? - They rig for the game. No, no, please. Please don't hurt me. I have said everything you asked for. I just want you guys to take it out. Go after the priest to pray for me Go for the doctor to heal my wounds My heart it aches it is crushed by the pain My body is free and ready to die - What is it for? - It's for the game, dumbass. I beg you. I don't want to play. AKUTINTAG Turn on the socket. - What happens then? - That's when our game begins. Turn on the plug! Oh my god! What a wonderful game. No no no... No wait! Wait... Zo! - Skinny? - Skeazy, you tramp! How glad I am to see you. I've been sitting here forever for no reason. - What happened to you? - I met a girl. - Obvious. - No, not that way. She was buried alive. She is immortal. Cool down. You are going absolutely insane. - They hit you too hard in the head. - But I was shot. She held my hand and I didn't notice anything. Where are the money? I don't know how it happened. - What do you mean? - I don't have them. - What do you mean by that? - I don't have them. - What the hell! - Take it easy, dammit. We come from here. We steal a car, or something. One of the guards is cute. She probably likes you. There will be no problems. I had a use for the money, Skeaze. It will be fine. We take them back. I have to get out of here. - Where did they find you? - There were no weapons in the car. Girls only. - What? Human smuggling? - Yes. I hate Turkey. Why is Kovak selling a truck without weapons? They functioned as weapons when detonated. You talk shit. I do not understand anything. Whatever it is about, we must not cod for it. We knew nothing. It was certainly a key word. He knows nothing. And what do you think you will? You said I could go if I got him here. What do you mean by that? You did the least imaginable. But I still believe in you. What do you want me to do? - Make him nice. - It's not necessary. - I said he doesn't know anything. - He told you exactly that. I don't like it when toys disappear before I've finished playing. I had no idea there were girls in the cargo. Why are you wasting my time? Someone doesn't like you, Skinny. I have my orders. Red is my favorite color. Hang in there, buddy. - So there. - No, you're not done yet! Mer! Again! More! Mer! No, no, let me go! No! The last piece of the puzzle. Welcome. Put this on. That. A little wax for my little bird. It doesn't take long. I'm testing a new formula. Let me know if you like it. There is no danger. Everything will be fine. I have to admit... that I always wanted to see the expressions... in their faces. Now you can rest. Who's next? That's me. I'm in luck. As you wish, my little bird. What kind of person are you? I've met people like you. You hide behind other people's decisions. 'I did not want to. They forced me.' 'I knew nothing. I would never have wanted that.' Let me make that clear to the doctor. This is my decision. Beautiful girl. - How do you know my name? - The surgeon. - What? - You have met the surgeon. I won't hurt you. I need to know how you know my name. Surgeon needs his friends. Do you understand what I'm telling you? I like taking pictures. What kind of pictures do you like to take? Things that once were. Things that will never come back again. - Gone, gone. - You mean dead things? I won't hurt you. I just want to understand. I know things. But my camera knows more. Can I see? Wait! Zophia... You know what? I actually met the surgeon. Have you photographed him? You can get a nice picture of him now. Zophia... Zophia. How did this happen? You're all... red. Who did this to you? We have to take care of her first. The others will have to wait. What the hell happened? Hello! Why am I hanging here? I have something to say to you. It's pretty cool. Yes, come on then! The tide rises periodically with large bodies of water. It is caused by the gravity of the Earth and the Moon. The moon's gravitational pull causes oceans to be drawn towards it. - And rivers. - What are you talking about? The moon will kill you, Skinny. Surely that's cool? Hell! It was just... Can't we redo it? - My whole body flew like a bird. - Stop it. The fact that I didn't know when was scary, but at the same time exciting... - Can we go higher? - Shut up! I'm not your toy. I'm so fucking sick of this. She was right about you. - Who was right? - Beautiful girl Zophia... Beautiful girl with an evil face, alive or there, what a lovely game. What are you talking about? Who is it? Where can I find them? Why don't you ask your friend. He is very handsome. Who then? He who hangs from the wishing tree and will soon drown. Can you take a picture for me? I wanted him to be proud of me. I didn't want him to see me as a boy, but as a fighting man. I thought I had it all figured out. An easy job, quick money, but... Now I have to watch my father die, because I couldn't imagine a real job. People get sick all the time. I also get sick all the time. But they get through it, because their families don't let them down. It's my fault that all the girls died. My father will die and Jaya… The only reason I'm not dead is because you made it physically impossible. To what use? I shouldn't be here. It's like someone is trying to erase me. I have sabbath everything. You can't sabbat it more than I did. - What is this? - Look at the pictures. - It's you. - It's a memory of mine. I'm not who you think I am. I have no idea who you are. I've been like this... Just like this... for a very long time. Nothing surprises me about you. I am 90 years old. It surprises me. Nikon took those pictures recently. Is the cartoonist who I think can i get help to get rid of the curse. How does it help me? The first time I understood what had happened, it was amazing. I climbed the tallest tree and threw myself out. The only certainty I knew about life was gone. Being able to act on every impulse was liberating. There were no consequences. There were no consequences at all. Why are you telling me this? I fell in love with helping other people, better people. But they just went crazy. Every single one of them. They took advantage of you. Have you ever been chased Skinny? Not for revenge, but for fun, for fun? No, I always deserved it. If you help me find the artist, she can transfer the curse to someone else. - My father? - I wouldn't choose the curse again. But I don't refuse anyone who has no other way out. You can still help him, Skinny. It can not be true. Dave! - Skinny! What happened to your face? - It's an allergy. - You can get something for it. You are wet. - I must have forgotten an umbrella. You have to help me. I want to get more involved here. - Excuse me? - I live a rather wide-ranging life. It's time for me to pay back to society. - I was thinking about... art therapy. - Art therapy? Artistic and therapeutic. - Do you want to teach art therapy? - Yes, do you have anyone interested in art admitted? I'll look into it. But we can't pay you. No, of course I work on a voluntary basis. Money is the root of all evil, isn't it? Amazingly, she has kept her name. Room 118. What gives us that honor? You don't usually come out of your playhouse. Judging by my nervous disposition, the gun in your hand and the sad, but numerous cavalry you have with you I would probably say that we are here for the same reason. - What reason then? - None of us can resist gossip. What? I haven't told anyone. Gossipmongers' gossip backfires on themselves. We'll see how much of that is true. It's been a long time, Zophia. - I thought you were dead. - I'm working on it. Can I see? It helped me remember you. - I have never forgotten you. - And now you're here. I'll be right back. You must tell me how to get rid of it. You are as beautiful as I remember you. Seeing you reminds me of how old I am. - You made your choice. - Did I? You can get it back. It doesn't have to end here. It already has, my love. Please tell me how to pass it on...just like you passed it on to me. I beg you. My father is dying. As charming as ever. It's not about me this time. I'm done with it. I want a real life. A life with less death in. Please tell me how to do it. Fan! It does not look good. Emma? Wait! I don't go anywhere without my son. - Okay, you come with us. - No! - Yeah. - No! No! Just let me die! Not until I, too, bring that opportunity. Tell us how you did it. We don't have time for that! Come on! The boss? Do not do it! For the hell of it! They come to my house. Shooting at me and at my son!! What the hell happened to respect?! You just shot them. You just shot them without… They shot at my son. I had to do something. You didn't even reflect. You just... And you! Who the hell are you? You are not a nurse. - What the hell is going on, dad? - Take it easy, my son. Everything will be fine. No one will try to kill you anymore. What do you mean? Did you know? You fixed it. I was about to give up hope. You have proven that you have what it takes. Falkov called you 'the boss'. Why did you do it? Why did you ruin such a beautiful moment? Why did he call you 'the boss'? He's not the sharpest knife. I am sick, my son. So far everything is true. And there's a reason I'm still here. It is because of you, my son. You have proven yourself worthy. - Worthy of what? - To take over the family business. Take over...? I've been shot! Buried! - Blown up in the air! - Yes! Yes! - You were put on probation. You are approved. - Approved? I should be dead. Had it not been for... What is mine, son? Had it not been for...? I have tried to help other people. Better people... This is the chance you've been waiting for and asking for. But it drove them crazy. Free yourself from the witch... and give me the cure I need. They took advantage of you. D and I can run this town together, as it should be. You are crazy. - I am your father. - You are a murderer. Just when I thought you had the Skinford gene you suddenly get a pussy between your skinny legs. A real man takes care of his family. Give me my medicine! You can't own her. She's nobody's business. Are you man enough to do your job? Won't you let me do my job? You are a fucking disgrace! You are worthless! And you, witch? You probably know how this ends. Want to play with the big boys? I'm almost jealous of you. Do you feel yourself fading away, old man? - Let go! - Satan's witch! Don't you know who you are dealing with? This is your own fault. All this. I want nothing to do with it. I no longer need to prove to you that I am good enough. Now I see that your praise means nothing. You're just a badass. And it should come from you? Where are you going? Are you going to leave your father to die? You are worse a worthless! You are nothing! A zero! Do you hear! I'll probably find you both! What was her secret? How did you get rid of it? She didn't give me the curse. I took it from her. - How did you do it? - No clue. - But I'll find out. - How? With my new best friend. Satan's pig!
