HAVE YOU SEEN HER? - SOMEONE HAS TO TELL HIM. - ISN'T SHE SOMETHING? - I THOUGHT YOU SAID THEY WANTED TO KEEP HER. - WELL, THEY CHANGED THEIR MIND, DIDN'T THEY? COULDN'T GET RID OF HER FAST ENOUGH ONCE THE SUBJECT OF MONEY WAS MENTIONED. - SHE DOESN'T LOOK VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT. - NONSENSE. WHERE IS THAT DRATTED FELLOW HIDING? HYNES! - JUST COMING. YES, SIR. - WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THIS DOG? - UM, MATTER, YOUR GRACE? - LOOK AT HER, MAN. - WELL, YOU MEAN HER NOT TAKING HER FOOD AND THAT? USED TO TABLE SCRAPS AND ALL SORTS, I SHOULD SAY. THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO HANDLE DOGS DOWN IN THAT VILLAGE. DON'T YOU WORRY YOUR PRETTY LITTLE HEAD ABOUT IT, MISS. I'LL HAVE HER EATING KENNEL-STYLE IN A DAY OR SO. - WHAT'S HER NAME? - THEY NEVER BOTHERED TO GIVE HER ONE. CALLED HER "LASS" OR "LASSIE." IT JUST MEANS "GIRL." NO FEELING FOR ANIMALS, IN MY EXPERIENCE. - DON'T WORRY; WE'LL GIVE HER A PROPER NAME. - I LIKE THE ONE SHE'S GOT. LASSIE? SEE? SHE KNOWS IT'S HER. - COME ON. YOU CAN COME BACK AND SEE HER LATER. - WHY CAN'T WE TAKE HER UP TO THE HOUSE WITH US? - WHEN SHE'S SETTLED. LET HER GET USED TO US FIRST. - I'LL SEE YOU EAT IF I HAVE TO PUSH YOUR BLOODY FOOD DOWN YOUR THROAT. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ME. I'M IN CHARGE NOW.

IT'S NOT HIS FAULT YOU CAN'T LOOK AFTER YOUR OWN PROPERTY. - HEY, YOU'VE NO CAUSE TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, SAM CARRACLOUGH. I KNOW YOU'VE TRAINED IT TO RUN. BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN, MAKE NO MISTAKE. [dog growls and barks] [sheep bleating] WILL YOU GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY? COME ON! OI! [horn beeps] OI!

THAT'S WHY SHE RUNS. - COURSE SHE'S HAPPY. SHE RUNS BECAUSE THEY'VE TRAINED HER TO DO IT. THEN THEY CAN STEAL HER BACK AND SELL HER TO SOMEBODY ELSE. BLOODY YORKSHIREMEN. THEY'RE NOTHING BUT THIEVING VAGABONDS, SCUM. - IF THEY WANTED TO STEAL HER, WHY DID THEY BRING HER BACK THEMSELVES? - WELL, BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS UP TO TRICKS, AREN'T THEY? BUT WE'RE TOO SMART FOR 'EM. [Lassie barks] HEY! DON'T TRY THAT WITH ME, YOU LITTLE BEGGAR. YOU STAY AWAY FROM HER, MISS.

THE DUKE'S GOING TO SCOTLAND TOMORROW, AND HE'S TAKING THE DOG WITH HIM. - JOE? YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS RIGHT BY STEALING HER BACK. - IT'S NOT STEALING WHEN SHE COMES BY HERSELF. - IT IS IF WE KEEP HER.

I SAID DON'T TOUCH THE BLOODY GATE! - OH, SORRY. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - THE STUPID GIRL'S LET THE COLLIE OUT. - WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BELT, MR. HYNES? - UM... - WERE YOU USING IT ON THE DOG? - NO, I WAS JUST TEACH-- - MR. HYNES, PLEASE DO NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD. NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHATSOEVER, WILL I ALLOW ANYONE TO ATTACK AN ANIMAL OF MINE. COLLECT WHAT WAGES ARE DUE TO YOU, AND LEAVE MY PROPERTY IMMEDIATELY. OTHERWISE, I WILL NOT BE ANSWERABLE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES. - I'LL LOOK AFTER THIS FOR YOU. - INTO THE CAR, YOUNG LADY. - BUT, YOUR GRACE-- YOUR GRACE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

SHE'S BETTER OFF WHERE SHE'LL GET FED PROPER, WITH A GRAND KENNEL AND A FINE BIG RUN, WITH STABLE BOYS TO WAIT ON HER HAND AND FOOT. SO LET IT GO. EH? [panting] - IF SHE'S NOT FOUND QUICKLY, SHE'LL DIE. SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ON HER OWN. - WHY NOT? - BECAUSE THE INSTINCT FOR KNOWLEDGE HAS BEEN BRED OUT OF HER. SHE'S A PET. SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO FEND FOR HERSELF, SO SHE'LL STARVE. AND THAT'S IF SHE DOESN'T FALL DOWN A CLIFF FIRST AND BREAK HER LEGS. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I SHALL CALL THE POLICE ONE MORE TIME. - YOU DON'T MEAN THAT. YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD. - AND DO YOU FEEL BAD? - YES. - GOOD. NOW GO TO BED.

BLOODY LASSIE? IF I HEAR THAT DOG'S NAME MENTIONED ONE MORE TIME IN THIS HOUSE, I SWEAR I'M GONNA WALK OUT AND LEAVE THE PAIR OF YOU! AS IF I HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH TO COPE WITH! [door slams] [chickens clucking] - WHO'S THERE? IS SOMEBODY AFTER MY CHICKENS? GO ON. GO ON! GO ON! GO ON, YOU FILTHY MONGREL! YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY CHICKENS, OR I'LL GIVE YOU A TASTE OF THIS!

WELL, HOW FAR IS THAT? - YOU'VE 100 MILES BEFORE SHE'S BACK ON THIS TRACK. - WHY WOULD SHE WANT TO DO THAT? - SHE HAS BUSINESS ON THE OTHER SIDE, MAYBE. YOUR COLLIE'S A SCOTTISH BREED ORIGINALLY, AND THE SCOTS CAN BE AWFUL DETERMINED WHEN THEY PUT THEIR MIND TO IT. - YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. - WHAT ABOUT? - IT WAS THE SUMMER OF '33, AND MARKLAND WAS THE BOWLER. - WELL, I TOLD YOU SO, OLD BOY.

SHE'S AS CAUTIOUS AS MY GRANNY BUT WILL OVERCOME HER FEAR. WHOA! HO HO! HO HO! NOW, WE KNOW A TRICK OR TWO, DON'T WE, TOOTS? LET'S SEE WHAT YOUR MAJESTY THINKS OF THIS, SHALL WE? THERE'S YOUR DINNER, YOUR HIGHNESS. EAT UP. COME ON, TOOTS. WE SEEM TO HAVE MADE A FRIEND AFTER ALL. PUT IT DOWN IN THE ROAD, AND IT'S NO GOOD. TOO WELL TRAINED. PUT IT DOWN IN A BOWL. THAT WAS THE SECRET. THAT MADE IT ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME ALONG WITH US IF YOU WANT ANY MORE. [Lassie barks] [bell tolling] - HELLO, JOE. HOW WAS YOUR DAY? - MISS BRANSON LIKED MY POEM. - WELL, THAT'S A SURPRISE. I DIDN'T THINK SHE LIKED ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE SOUND OF HER OWN VOICE. [laughs] - DID YOU HEAR FROM DAD? - NO, BUT HE'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. I'M SURE OF IT. [vendors shouting their wares] - WE CAN'T BE BEATEN ON OUR PRICES! FRESH EGGS! GET YOUR FRESH EGGS HERE! - HELLO, EVERYBODY! children: HELLO! - HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY DOG, TOOTS? children: NO! - WELL, ARE YOU SURE? children: HE'S BEHIND YOU! - WHERE? children: HE'S BEHIND YOU! [Toots barks] - OH! OH OH OH OH OH! [whistle blasting] ROLL UP, ROLL UP, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BOYS AND GIRLS, FOR THE TERRIFYING TALE OF ANDROCLES AND THE LION. WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE, TOOTS? COME DOWN. [children laugh] WERE YOU LOOKING AFTER THE CHILDREN? WHO WANTS TO SEE A TRICK BY TOOTS THE WONDER DOG? all: ME! - UP YOU GO. [laughter] THERE YOU ARE. A ROUND OF APPLAUSE, PLEASE. NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE TERRIFYING TALE OF ANDROCLES AND THE LION. YOUR HIGHNESS, IF YOU PLEASE. YOU'RE DOING FINE, YOUR MAJESTY. YOU'RE DOING FINE. SO ANDROCLES FOUND HIMSELF ALONE IN THE DESERT WHEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD A STRANGE SOUND. THE POOR SLAVE ANDROCLES WAS VERY FRIGHTENED BY THE LION, BUT THEN HE NOTICED SOMETHING UNUSUAL. LOOKING CLOSELY, ANDROCLES SAW THERE WAS A THORN IN THE LION'S PAW, AND THAT'S WHY THE LION WAS SO UNHAPPY. SO PLUCKING UP HIS COURAGE, HE TOOK HOLD OF THE LION'S PAW AND PLUCKED OUT THE THORN. THE ANGEL GABRIEL GOT A BIT OF A BLACK EYE LAST YEAR, SO THIS YEAR, HE'LL HAVE A NEW HEAD. I RECKON HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT FOR CHRISTMAS. WHAT DO YOU THINK? BEGINNING TO FEEL THE COLD, ARE YOU? AH, WINTER'S COMING. I THINK WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THE RIVIERA THIS SEASON, YOUR MAJESTY. IT'S TIME TO HEAD BACK. YOU'LL LIKE IT AT HOME. WON'T SHE, TOOTS? WELL, WE BEST GET TIDIED UP, GET AN EARLY START TOMORROW. - WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? - IT'S A BLOODY MIDGET. - IS IT, NOW? OR ARE WE LOOKING AT A BLOOMIN' DWARF? - WHAT? - DWARVES OR MIDGETS. YOU HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE ABOUT THESE THINGS. - DWARVES ARE RICHER. THEY DIG FOR GOLD. - THEN LET'S CALL IT A DWARF. - DO YOU THINK HE'LL HAVE IT WITH HIM? THE GOLD? - LET'S GO AND ASK THE LITTLE FELLA, SHALL WE? [Lassie and Toots barking] WATCH YOUR DOG, LITTLE FELLA. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE AIN'T DOING NOTHING. - QUIET DOWN, YOUR MAJESTY. QUIET DOWN. TOOTS. - THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [growls] YOU HAVING A CUPPA? ISN'T THAT NICE? COULD YOU JUST SPARE A SWALLOW FOR A COUPLE OF HOMELESS CHAPS LOOKING FOR WORK? WE'VE GOT A FRESH-CAUGHT RABBIT WE COULD LET YOU HAVE BY WAY OF EXCHANGE. - YOU'RE WELCOME, FRIEND. THE WATER'S ALMOST BOILED. THE TEA'S IN THE WAGON. I'LL JUST GET IT. - NO HURRY. IS THERE, MATE? - NO HURRY AT ALL. - ONLY SORRY WE MISSED THE SHOW. BIG AUDIENCE, WAS IT? BET YOU MAKE QUITE A KILLING THIS TIME OF YEAR-- CHRISTMAS COMING AND ALL THAT. COME ON. WHERE IS IT? - THE GOLD. - 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE NICE AND HAND IT OVER, WE WON'T HURT YOU, WILL WE, MR. S? - NO. WE WON'T HURT YOU. - AFRAID I HAVEN'T GOT ANY GOLD, JUST TEA. - SO YOU WANT IT THE HARD WAY, DO YOU, LITTLE 'UN? FAIR ENOUGH. OW! DON'T JUST STAND THERE. GET IN AFTER HIM, YOU BLOOMING COWARD! - AH! YOU LITTLE BEGGAR! [barks] - STAY OUT OF THIS, YOUR MAJESTY! TOOTS AND I CAN TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES. - YOU WANT SOME OF THIS, DO YOU? IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT? COME ON, MY LITTLE BEAUTY. [Lassie yelps] NOW GO HOME! GET OUT OF IT! [laughs] WHAT A DOG. YOU SEE, LITTLE FELLA, EVEN YOUR BEST FRIEND CAN'T STAND B-- - YOU GET UNDERNEATH THE WAGON. I'LL GET THE CASH. - RIGHT. [Toots growling] SNICKERS, WHERE ARE YA? - THERE'S NO SIGN OF HIM UNDER HERE. - I'M AWARE. [Toots snarling] - NO. - AH! OOH! [yapping] [Toots snarls] - TOOTS, GET AWAY! TOOTS! - YOU BLOOMIN' RAT. thud! - [yelling] GET IT OFF! [Lassie barks] I HATE DOGS. I ALWAYS HAVE. - HELLO, THERE, MY DARLING. YOU PUT UP A PRETTY GOOD FIGHT, DIDN'T YOU, NOW? [Lassie whimpers] QUIET, YOUR MAJESTY. SHE HASN'T MUCH TIME LEFT. SEVEN YEARS, WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER, AND I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR BETTER COMPANY. WHAT BLESSINGS HE HAS TO SPARE, MAY GOD GIVE THEM TO YOU NOW. - THE LORD SAYS HIS FATHER NOTICES EVEN THE FALL OF A SINGLE SPARROW. SO TRUSTING IN HIM, WE COMMEND OUR DEAR FRIEND TO HIS BOSOM. COME ON, THEN, YOUR MAJESTY. DON'T WANT TO? WELL, PERHAPS IT'S BEST THAT WAY. STILL WANT TO GO SOUTH, DO YOU? WINTER IN THE RIVIERA WITH ALL THE OTHER LA-DI-DAHS. I'D LIKE TO GO WITH YOU, BUT WINTER'S COMING, AND I'D BEST BE GETTING BACK HOME. BESIDES... YOU'D ALWAYS BE REMINDING ME OF MY TOOTS, WOULDN'T YOU, LASS? [barks] HEY. THAT'S THE PITY OF IT. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND MY LANGUAGE, BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOURS. AND IT'S US THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST INTELLIGENT. WE HAD SOME PRETTY GOOD TIMES TOGETHER, DIDN'T WE? YEAH. WELL... OFF YOU GO, THEN. AND MAY LUCK GO WITH YOU. OFF YOU GO. COME ON, THEN, OLD GIRL. TIME TO HEAD FOR HOME. - WHAT WAS THAT? - SOME KIND OF ANIMAL, DARLING. A FOX, I SHOULD THINK. - IT LOOKED BIGGER THAN A FOX TO ME. - LOOK, WE'RE HERE. - WILL GRANDPA HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE? - OF COURSE. IT'LL BE THE BIGGEST YOU'VE EVER SEEN. - CAN WE LIGHT THEM NOW? - NO, DARLING. IT'LL BURN DOWN. IT'S ALL WE'VE GOT LEFT. WE'LL LIGHT THEM WHEN WE GET BACK FROM CHURCH. COME ON. YOU'LL BE LATE FOR PRACTICE. children: * O COME, ALL YE FAITHFUL * JOYFUL AND TRIUMPHANT * O COME YE, O COME YE * TO BETHLEHEM * COME AND BEHOLD HIM * BORN THE KING OF ANGELS * O COME, LET US ADORE HIM * O COME, LET US ADORE HIM * O COME, LET US ADORE HIM * CHRIST - HAPPY CHRISTMAS. - * THE LORD - I KNEW YOU'D MAKE IT. IS IT SNOWING? - AYE. AYE, IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUTSIDE. - AND INSIDE TOO. - * LEAVING THEIR FLOCKS * DRAW NIGH TO GAZE [carol continues in the distance] * [barks] [barks] * IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER * FROSTY WIND MADE MOAN * EARTH STOOD HARD AS IRON * WATER LIKE A STONE * SNOW HAD FALLEN, SNOW ON SNOW * SNOW ON SNOW * WHAT CAN I GIVE HIM * POOR AS I AM? [distant singing] [dog whimpering] - CRICKET, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - WHERE'S JOE? - I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS RIGHT HERE. - LASSIE. IT'S LASSIE! SHE'S COME HOME! - LISTEN FOR YOURSELF, JOE. THE HEART'S VERY FAINT, BUT IT IS THERE. SHE'S HAD A TERRIBLE ORDEAL, AND I CAN'T SAY WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE SHE'LL SURVIVE IT. AN ANIMAL DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT FOR LIFE IN THE WAY A HUMAN OFTEN CAN. IT MAY BE THAT, HAVING GOT HOME AND HAVING ACHIEVED WHAT SHE WANTED, SHE'LL BE CONTENT TO JUST GO TO SLEEP AND PASS ON. - IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO? - TRY AND GET HER TO EAT SOMETHING. WARM MILK AND BRANDY, I WOULD SUGGEST. - WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY BRANDY. - I'VE GOT SOME. WE WERE SAVING IT FOR THE CHRISTMAS PUDDING. - WE'LL ALL SEE HOW SHE IS IN THE MORNING. I'LL COME ROUND FIRST THING. - [giggling] - THIS IS FOR YOU. I MADE IT MYSELF. - FOR ME? - AT SCHOOL, I WANTED TO REMIND MYSELF THAT IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE. - DID YOU INDEED? [chuckles] [knock at door] - I KNOW SHE'S HERE, SO DON'T TRY AND MAKE ANY TROUBLE. AND I'VE GOT OFFICERS OF THE LAW WITH ME JUST IN CASE YOU DO. - HE CAN'T TAKE HER, CAN HE? - THIS IS A SICK ANIMAL. SHE CAN'T BE MOVED. - WE HAVE A CERTIFICATE FROM THE VET HERE SAYING SHE'S FIT TO TRAVEL. WELL, GO ON, THEN. GET ON WITH IT. - DON'T TOUCH HER. - I'M SORRY, SAM. WE'VE SEEN THE PAPERS. EVERYONE KNOWS YOU SOLD HER. - SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNLESS I TAKE HER MYSELF. - THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. OFFICERS? - SHE'S UNDER MY CARE. I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR HER. - WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? YOU WANT HER BACK. HE'LL TAKE HER BACK. - NO! - YOU CAN COME TOO, JOE. - I'M NOT STOPPING HERE BY MYSELF. - WELL, I DEMAND AN ESCORT IN CASE THEY RUN OFF WITH HER. THEY'VE TRIED IT BEFORE, YOU KNOW. - OH, SHUT UP. - RIGHT, YOU KEEP AN EYE ON THEM. I'LL GET IT SORTED. - THAT'S IT. - YOUR GRACE? YOUR GRACE! [growling] MR. HYNES IS HERE, YOUR GRACE, AND HE WAS MOST INSISTENT-- - I'VE FOUND HER, YOUR GRACE. I'VE FOUND HER. I'VE GOT HER OUTSIDE, JUST LIKE YOU ORDERED. - LASSIE. HE'S FOUND LASSIE! - PLEASE, EVERYBODY STAY HERE. - I TOLD YOU SHE'D NOT GET PAST ME. DETECTIVE WORK, YOUR GRACE-- MONTHS OF IT. I KNEW IT'D PAY OFF IN THE END. - SHE ARRIVED HERE CHRISTMAS EVE VERY POORLY. WE WERE JUST LOOKING AFTER HER UNTIL SHE WERE WELL ENOUGH TO BRING BACK. - MM-HMM. AND WHAT ARE THESE OFFICERS DOING HERE, EXACTLY? - WELL, YOUR GRACE, MR. HYNES HERE SAYS THAT THIS HERE ANIMAL IS STOLEN. QUITE INSISTENT, HE WAS. - WAS HE INDEED? WELL, LET'S HAVE A LOOK, SHALL WE? WOULD YOU ALLOW ME TO EXAMINE YOUR ANIMAL, YOUNG MAN? WELL, I'LL BE BLOWED. ALL THE WAY TO BERMUDA AND BACK AGAIN, WHAT? - PLEASE-- - QUIET, BOY. I SUPPOSE YOU THINK I'M AN OLD BUFFER WHO'S EASILY FOOLED. THIS ISN'T MY DOG. ANY IDIOT CAN SEE THAT. - SHE MUST BE SOME KIND OF STRAY YOU PICKED UP. WELL, DON'T TRY PALMING HER OFF ON ME. THE DOG I BOUGHT WAS BIG AND HEALTHY, NOT A WORN-OUT OLD MUTT LIKE THIS ONE. MR. HYNES HERE KNOWS THAT VERY WELL. - YOUR GRACE, LOOK AT THESE MARKINGS. I'LL STAKE MY REPUTATION-- - REPUTATION? MR. HYNES, I THINK WE ARE BOTH AWARE WHAT A FRAGILE LITTLE CREATURE THAT IS. DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, MAN! HOW COULD A DOG GET ALL THE WAY HERE FROM SCOTLAND? IT'S NEARLY 500 MILES FOR A BIRD, LET ALONE FOR A DOG WANDERING ABOUT, TRYING TO MAKE ITS OWN WAY. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. WOULDN'T YOU AGREE, OFFICER? - YES, YOUR GRACE. IF YOU SAY IT'S NOT YOURS, THEN THAT'S THE END OF IT. - YOU KEEP HER IF YOU WANT HER. NOTHING TO DO WITH ME. NOTHING TO DO WITH ME. COME ALONG, GIRLIE. - THAT WAS KIND OF YOU. - NONSENSE. I'M NOT A KIND PERSON. I'M NOT FINISHED YET. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - YOUR GRACE. I SWEAR THAT WAS YOUR DOG. SHE KNEW ME. I COULD TELL. - MR. HYNES, ARE YOU STILL HERE? - YES, SIR. I MEAN, YOUR GRACE, SIR. - I'M SORRY, BUT YOU MUST EXCUSE US. WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF LUNCH. SOME OTHER TIME, PERHAPS. - BUT I'M TELLING YOU-- - SKIPPER, BOATSWAIN. [dogs growling] - HELLO, BOYS. REMEMBER ME? NOW, THEN. NOW, THEN. LET'S NOT GET TOO EXCITED, EH? STAY. STAY. COR LUMMY. - I HAVE A PROPOSITION TO MAKE TO YOU, MR. CARRACLOUGH. SINCE THE SAD DEPARTURE OF MR. HYNES, WE HAVE A VACANCY AT THE HALL. I WONDERED IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED-- HEAD KENNEL MAN, LOOKING AFTER MY DOGS. WHEN THE ARMY IS DONE WITH YOU, OF COURSE. THE PAY IS FAIR ENOUGH, I SHOULD THINK. - AND HOW MUCH WOULD "FAIR ENOUGH" BE, EXACTLY? - OOH, I SHOULD SAY... - SEVEN POUND? - GOOD LORD, NO! FIVE AND NOT A PENNY MORE. - SIX POUND TEN SHILLING. - SHALL WE CALL IT SIX GUINEAS? - DONE. - [spits] YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN, MRS. CARRACLOUGH. - AND WHAT ABOUT THE KENNEL MAN'S COTTAGE ON THE MOOR? - AS HEAD KENNEL MAN, YES, THE COTTAGE WOULD BE YOURS. YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE THE FAMILY AND, OF COURSE, ANY ANIMALS YOU HAVE. WOULD THAT BE ACCEPTABLE? - THANK YOU, YOUR GRACE. THAT WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE. - THAT OLD MUTT OF YOURS IS LOOKING A LITTLE BETTER, YOUNG MAN. - YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE HER IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. - I DON'T DOUBT IT. [chuckles] I DON'T DOUBT IT. COME ON, GIRLIE. NOW, DON'T WRIGGLE. I CAN'T STAND ANYONE WRIGGLING. - SEE? YOU ARE NICE AFTER ALL. - NONSENSE. I SWORE I'D HAVE THAT DOG, AND NOW I'VE GOT HER. I JUST HAD TO BUY THE MAN AS WELL. I THINK I'VE GOT A BARGAIN. DON'T YOU? [laughs] [bicycle bell rings] - GOOD MORNING, MRS. CARRACLOUGH. IS JOE HERE? - HELLO. AYE, HE'S INSIDE. GO ON. IN YOU GO AND SEE HIM. - WHERE ARE THEY? - SHH. UNDER THE STAIRS. - [gasps] HOW MANY? - SEVEN. - SEVEN. THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. ARE THEY STILL BLIND? - NO, THEY GET THEIR EYES OPEN WHEN THEY'RE TEN DAYS OLD. THEY'LL BE RUNNING ABOUT ON THEIR OWN SOON ENOUGH. [puppies barking] [sweeping orchestral music] *
