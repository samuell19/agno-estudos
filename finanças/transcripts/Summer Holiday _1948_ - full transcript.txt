You'll be busy there, you'll never think of me. Of course, I will.

I'm not stopping there. A book I read opened my eyes and showed me this is a silly farce. I'll tell them too. What'll Ms. Holly say to that? I won't tell her, I'll spring it on her. I'm gonna say things that are positively revolutionary. Richard, what, what kind of things? Well, never mind. Don't be surprised that they find a change in the whole social system. Don't tell anyone. I only told you because you're the only one I can talk to. The only one who understands me. I don't always understand you, Richard. I know but I don't expect anybody to really understand me. Well, I should think your father would. I can't talk to him. He's never had to face the problems I have. He'll know a lot about books and things. Running a newspaper. Not the kind of books I read. My father's like all the other fathers. What do they know about life? No, my mind's made up. I'm gonna live. Have a jellybean. - Good, aren't they? - Hmm. Delicious. Muriel, I'm gonna miss you somethin' awful. I'm glad, Richard. Life goes by so quickly we've gotta make every moment count. I-I know. What time is it, Richard? Father'll get mad if I'm not home. I thought, now that I was going away, couldn't I wouldn't you let me kiss you goodbye? Rich, you're not going away until September. It's only June.

Don't you hit me with that. Richard, you knew Uncle Sid was leaving tonight, didn't ya? Yes. He said he'd leave after lunch I didn't feel hungry so I was just.. Fella gives up a lot for a girl. You quit food. It's not that bad, dad. - Help Uncle Sid with his bags. - Yes, sir. Boo! [knock on door] Come in. - Hello, Uncle Sid. - Well, hello! - Did you pack? - Yes. Well, you might take this apart for me, if you will. Remember the last time we were down at Freemans Creek. You caught 30 and I didn't catch one. Now that I'm leaving I'll let you in on a little secret. I used to tell those fish very sad stories. Real heartbreakers. They'll get so despondent they'd hang themselves on my hook. [both laughing] Gosh, we've had so swell times, haven't we? Yeah. Now, we're.. ...growing older. We sure are, grandpa. Now, will you give me that bottle? Uncle Sid? Uh, on second thought maybe you shouldn't. I'm won't show my face around here unless I make good. Who says you haven't made good? I say so. I'm nearly 50 and how much money have I got? Money? Money. That's all the stupid world thinks about. That's because we're livin' in a decadent society. Well, I want to join the society. Don't forget, son. That suit you've got on costs money. Mankind was better off when we lived in the dark ages. When everybody went around naked. Well, maybe so. But today it might interfere with your social life. Yes, sir, I'm gonna show this family what I can do. I'll surprise them this time. You're going away because it's what they want. They're driving you away. Oh, no, no, Richard. They've been awful nice to me. Why, every time I got.. I mean, I made a mistake your mother and father always forgave me. Ha ha! How bitter the grapes of forgiveness. They don't realize that a man needs more than forgiveness. He needs understanding. I understand you, Uncle Sid. Well, thank you, son. I wish you were gonna be around for graduation. I'll tell them what's wrong with the whole capitalistic system. Wait a minute. Mr. Peabody the head of the school board is a banker. You better be careful The whole world's sick. That's why we have so much war and crime, drinking.. [coughing] I'm sorry. I didn't mean that for you. Well, I, I only take a drop when I have a cold. Of course that cold's been hangin' on for years. A man's only the symbol of the world he lives in. If he drinks to ease his agony it's really the world that's drinking. The worlds drinking? Then how is it I get drunk? Well, uh, Uncle Sid, your a martyr. You're a victim of society's intolerance. - I am? - Yeah. Hmmm. I never thought of it like that. Yeah, I'm a martyr. But you don't have to be. A man can do anything he wants. If he's strong enough. (Nat) 'Sid, the hack's waiting.' Huh! Coming, Nat. Well, I'll close this for you. Here. You want this box? Oh, yeah. Be careful of those cookies. I'll take it for you. Let me. - It's heavy. - No, it's alright. - Alright? - I can do it. Well, here we go. [Tommy ululating] Hurry up, Sid. - Hurry up, Uncle Sid. - The hack's waiting. - Here comes. - Such excitement. Tommy! Lemme help you with those bags? [indistinct chatter] Who called my name in vain? Somebody goin' away? Ha ha! Goodbye, big boy. Good luck, Uncle Sid. Goodbye, beautiful. Don't break to many hearts. Goodbye, you little devil. Don't forget to send me something good. Tommy, where are your manners? Good luck on your graduation, Richard. Thanks, Uncle Sid. Just remember Invictus. "Out as the night that covers me "black's the pit rom pole to pole I thank whatever God's maybe for my unconquerable soul." Let's get these bags. It'll be different this time, Nat. You bet your life, Sid. You tell that Waterbury bunch they're gettin' the best reporter I ever had. - Sis. - Write to us, Sid. Promise. - I promise. - We'll miss you. Oh, now, Essie, please. Oh-h..

It is a privilege and an honor to present our outstanding citizen who in turn will present the valedictorian Mr. Josiah Peabody. Chairman of the school board. [applause] Ladies and gentlemen. I consider this a rare privilege. A rare privilege! To be selected valedictorian of this great and magnificent high school is a fine tribute. It demonstrates that the young man who achieved this immortal honor has the highest type of intelligence. A truly outstanding personality. And an honesty and integrity that marks a truly great and shining leader. I too was a valedictorian. I treasure the memory. I treasure it so much that today when you walk in to the first National Bank of which I am proud to be president and sole owner with assets of more than three and one half millions of dollars you will see my diploma from this same beloved high school 'framed over my safe.' That's what I think of this school. And now it's an honor to wish the same successful future to the class valedictorian.. ...Richard Miller. Ahem! Fellow classmates.. ...friends.. ...I, as your spokesman.. ...am saying farewell.. (Richard) '...to one part of our lives.' Thinking over this.. few years here at school I have likened them to the journeying's of a little brook. We are the waters of that brook. Some of us have sprung out of the Earth like clear springs. Others have gotten their beginnings (Richard) 'in the snows of the lofty mountains.' Nevertheless, in four years journey one drop has been as another. Course of our journey has been a simple one. It has been held between prescribed banks. But we have been glad to be guided. (Richard) 'Realizing that in our youth' 'we have needed help.' 'Everything was made smooth for us.' No obstacles were in our way. Pebbles, rather than rocks. Gentle slopes, rather than rapids. But now we have run our course. (Richard) 'We are nearing the sea.' 'Where we will lose each other.' Strange currents will carry us here and there. We will have to breast the waves of adversity. There will be no course to guide us there. We will crush ourselves upon the rocks to break or to be broken. There will be no loving hands to help us. No teachers or parents to guide us on our way. (Richard) 'And as these mounting waves of adversity' 'these terrifying elements descend upon us' 'many will be afraid.' 'Many will want to turn back.' 'In that time of terror' 'of danger of doubt' let us always keep before us the ideals and the principles that we have learned here in this school. Honesty, integrity and perseverance. With these, we can climb to any heights. (Richard) 'bring glory to this school' 'and win a lasting place for ourselves' in the great world that lies before us. [applause] But.. That was fine, Richard, fine! I don't care if you're my boy. I'm proud of you. Yeah, that's a great speech. I'm proud of this school. [indistinct chatter] [band music] Well, what's the matter, Richard? You ought to feel pretty good right now. I didn't finish my speech. I was just starting the important part. Yeah, I know, I read it. Did you get that from some books you've been reading lately? Some of them. Didn't know you felt that way. I thought you'd like to drive the Stanley steamer home today. Me? Might be against your principles.. How? You might say that car was bought with the life-blood of poor wage slaves. Oh, gee, dad, I didn't mean.. Could I? If your conscience lets you ask Muriel if she'll go with you. Thanks, dad. Fine boy you've got, Miller. Don't run over Mr. Peabody unless you can't help it. I'll ask Muriel. He's a brilliant boy, Nat. Yeah, look who his father is. You mark my words. He'll go far. Just so long as he doesn't go too far. Hey, Art, there's a cute little chicken down at the drugstore.. - ...who's got possibilities. - Skidoo. Skidoo. Okay, kiddo. - I'm glad you could come. - So am I. - I'm gonna drive it myself. - Can you? Sure, not many fellas can handle a Stanley Steamer It'll get up to 25 miles an hour. Richard you wouldn't drive that fast. Oh, maybe I wouldn't. Not with women and children in the car. Goodbye, Mr. Danville.

Where's Richard? He was sitting in his bed reading. You gonna have to speak to him. He's spending entirely too much time reading the wrong books. He's never on time for his meals anymore. Everybody else but Richard has to be on time. Richard has to be no time too. Richard? Richard! - Richard! - 'Coming right away.' - He knows no books-- - I better go change my things. Excuse me. I've gotta get ready for the picnic. Ours starts at 10:00. Wake up, Richard. It's 4th of July. You take care of your own fourth. - Do you want me, pa? - I thought I made that plain. - Eat your breakfast. - No, thanks. What are you planning on doing with yourself today, Richard? Are you going to the young people's picnic? That silly skirt party, no. I'll wager you're going some place with Muriel. Muriel and I haven't decided what we are going to do yet. Besides.. ...I don't believe in this silly celebrating in the 4th of July. All this lying talk about liberty. - When there is no liberty. - Richard. Land of the free and home of the brave. Home of the slave is what it is. The wage slave. Being ground under by the capitalist class. Starving, crying out for bread. For his children. When only gets is a stone. No you celebrate your own fourth. I'll celebrate the day that the people bring back the guillotine. And we see Pierpont Morgan being driven by in a tumbril. If you don't speak to him. We'll be the ones driven by in a tumbril. You, kid. Tie that bull outside. You ought to be punched in the nose for talking that way. Wait till we get you down to Yale. - We'll take that out of you. - Yale? After all, what is Yale? You'll find out. Excuse me, dad. I've gotta pick up Elsie in half an hour. Now that you've made your stump speech of the day. You better sit down and eat your breakfast. - What have we got here? - Carlyle's French Revolution. That's why you drove the tumblin' pile poor ol' Pierpont into it. Well, it's a darn fine book. I'm glad you're reading it. - Well, Nat. - What have you read it? Even a newspaper owner can't get out of reading a book. Oh, I didn't mean.. Not to.. It's a great book, isn't it? After breakfast I want you to bring all these books down and let your father see. We'd waste the whole darn morning on those books. What books have you got, Richard? - Well, there's-- - One with a book of poetry. "The ballad of.." I forget what. "The Ballad of Reading Goal." One of the greatest poems ever written. And there was book of poems from Swin something. "Poems and Ballads" by Swinburne. The greatest poet since Shelly. He told the truth about real love. Hmm. And last there was a poem a long one the...Ruby.. What is it, Richard? "The Rubaiyat" of Omar Khayyam. - That's the best of all. - Yeah. I've read that one. - Nat? - I've got a copy at office. Fine things and some truth seem to be two things. - Well, Nat, I don't see-- - It's wonderful. Remember the part that goes. "A book of verses underneath the bough. "A jug of wine, a loaf of bread. "And thou beside me singing in the wilderness. I don't think that's any kind of reading for you. - Uh-ha. - Essie. I've gotta go and see Muriel. - Excuse me. - Go ahead. I guess well all get started if we're going to get to picnic. Oh, look, Nat. Drops for your picnic. Hmm. A lot of horses, haven't they? Yes. That isn't all they've got. I don't know why men have those things. You won't find beer at women's picnic. Hmm. I better get started. Now, Nat. I hope you won't.. Woman, you're not insinuating-- Well, I've seen you after some of those picnics. I didn't need any bird to tell me you've been besides the well. Hello, Tommy, my lad. Hello, Uncle Sid. I'm Uncle Sam. Oh, well. Hello, uncle. Did you get vacation too? Yeah. I suppose you might call it that. - I'll go tell 'em you're here. - Yes. Pa, ma, guess who's come to spend the fourth. Spend the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, ad infinitum. 'Well, Sid.' I'm glad to see you. This make it a real holiday. Oh, thank you, Nat. I know a boy who collects snakes. - Well, now.. - Dead ones. - 'Sid!' - Well, that's.. Oh, this is a surprise. - Yeah, well.. - You staying overnight? Well, I might if you insist. - Well, certainly. - We insist. You can leave on the morning train. Uh, yes. Where is the one and only Lil? Oh, she's in the kitchen. She'd be tickled pink. Excuse me. I've to get dressed. See you later, Sid. - Yeah. - Well, how is the job? Yeah. The job it's.. Oh, it's fine. Fine. Ah, just what you need, you know to.. ...kinda straighten you out. Yes. It was. Is..

Well...you see, Nat, there's, uh...well.. As a matter of fact I've missed you on the paper. I wished you'd consider taking your old job back. Thanks, Nat. Come on, let's go tell ol' Lily the good news. Oh, Lily, look who's here. - Sid! When did you get here? - Hello, Lily. We didn't know you were coming. Well, neither did I. Oh, my, you look well. - Just fine. - We've got a surprise for you. I needed Sid on paper, I asked him to quit and come back here. - Oh! - I had to talk him to it. Oh, I'm so glad. We, uh...we all missed you, Sid. Well, you're the prettiest thing I've seen in weeks, Lily. Oh. There's some mighty pretty girls in Waterbury. Oh, Sid, you silly. Did you have breakfast? As a matter of fact I would like a cup of coffee. Well, I'll get it for ya. Now, you sit down. Oh! I'm, I'm so happy about you, Sid. Oh. - Your letters. - Hmm. I'm proud that you did so well in Waterbury. Oh, please. Let's not talk about my success. It's embarrassing. Oh, well, you always were too modest, Sid. But, I always knew you could succeed if you just abstained. If you'd only, uh.. you know. Uh, yes. I, uh.. That was the only thing that stood in the way of everything. And now that you've conquered that habit. Well.. ...you know what I said when.. ...when you went away. - Lily. - Yes, Sid. Could I have a little more coffee? Of course. They're, uh, they're gonna have the big display of fireworks again this year, aren't they? Umm-hmm. Tonight. At the beach. Would you.. Could I take you? Do you want to? Oh, you know I do, Lil. There's gonna be a new moon tonight. That's right. Maybe.. Maybe we can sort of talk everything over tonight. Hm? Yes, tonight. Hello. Uh, come on, Lilly. We.. Let the dishes go.

You look lovely. Oh, thanks, Essie. I-I thought I might dress up a little bit. Sid is taking me to the fireworks. - Let me fix that lace. - Thank you, Essie. Can we eat now? I'm hungry. As soon as everyone's back home. And don't you say a word about that blue fish, understand? - I get ya. - Uh-uh. Nat says there's an oil in it that poisons him. But I tell him it's white fish. - Aren't you ashamed? - Not much. I like blue fish. We better see how dinner's coming. - I wish they'd hurry up. - Isn't it hot? - Ooh! - Come on that's enough. Pull yourself together. Go upstairs and stick your head under the tap. You think you can make it? Well, there's always reasonable room for doubt. I'll cover up for you down here. Here we're, sweetheart. Here we are. Right on the dot. Here we are. You said that three times. Don't be critical, Essie. Good news can bear repeating. Can it? Of course it can. Oh, aren't you crazy. Where's Sid? Uh, he's upstairs. He'd be right down. Good. We want to get dinner over early. Mr. McComber is coming out, can I scalp him? What does he want? Can I scalp him? - May I. - May I? Well, we'll see later. What do you suppose that old buzzard wants? Well, Dave what brings you here this glorious fourth? I want to talk to you, Nat. I'm glad to see you. Come in. Happy you dropped over. Now just make yourself comfortable. Sit down. Sit down, Dave. I don't want to sit down. No? Well, how about a cigar? You're forgetting I never smoke. No. Yeah, that's right. Well, then I'll smoke alone. I'll come to the point at once, Nat. No use beating around the bush. It's about your son Richard. Yeah, what about him? He's deliberately trying to corrupt the morals of my young daughter Muriel. I'm afraid I will have to call you a liar. Ah, I thought you'd get around to that. I personally caught him in the woods this afternoon. making vile advances to Muriel. - Advances? - He was trying to kiss her. Since when does a kiss from a decent kid been considered vile advances? Now you're insulting my daughter. I'm not insulting her. I'm just giving her credit for ordinary good sense. That isn't all. My wife found these in one of Muriel's bureau drawers. Hid under her stockings. They are in his handwriting. You read them and then say I'm a liar. Evidently you've been too busy to take the right care about Richard's bringing up. Or what he's allowed to read. I can't see why his mother failed at her duty. Can't you see that Richard's just a fool kid where is out to rebel against all authority. So he grasped anything radical to read just so he can pass it on and show off a little. In heart you'll find Richard as innocent as Muriel is. Muriel is never going to see him again. Here's a letter to your son. Telling him what she thinks of him. I'm punishing her and if you don't give him lacing he'll remember to the last day--. Now see here I've stood all I could stand from you. Now you get out of here. If you don't want a kick in the rear. I'm going. But you'll regret this. I'm taking my ad out of your paper. Unless you promise to punish him. I'll be hanged if I will. That's plain bluff. I know how badly you need my ad. Now see here. I'm gonna call your bluff. I'm gonna refuse to print your darn ad. Now put that in your pipe and smoke it. [knock on door] Yeah? - Richard? - Yes, pa. Gonna ask you a question. I want an honest answer. I warn you if your answer is yes I'm gonna punish you hard because you'll have done something no boy of mine ought to do. Now, you've never lied to me before I know and I don't think to save yourself punishment you would lie to me now, would you? - I won't lie, pa. - Alright. Now Dave McComber was just here. What? What have you been up to with Muriel? Have you been behaving yourself? Oh, gee, pa. What do you think I am? I'm in love with Muriel. And I wanna marry her. As soon as I graduate from college. That's fine. That's all I wanted to know. Alright. What does that old idiot McComber said about me? Shouldn't call your future father-in-law names. It isn't respectable. And after all you can't exactly blame Dave when you look through this literature you've sent his innocent daughter. Oh. So that's why. He found these, did he? I'm afraid I'll have to agree that they are not exactly reading for a young girl but.. Well, I may you'd be alright for you who are a man, but.. You think it over and see if you don't agree. Gee, I only did it because I wanted her to face life as it really is. She's afraid of afraid of being in love. Afraid of her old man. I thought I'd give courage to lead her own life. To not think about being afraid. Yeah. Well, I'm afraid she's still afraid. Here's a letter from her. You better be prepared for bit of a jolt. Never mind, Richard. There plenty of other fish in the sea. Don't be too long. You're mother has dinner waiting. "And don't ever attempt to see me again." Why you little coward. I hate her. She can't do this to me. I'll show her. When Sid comes in, if he's a little under the weather. - Just don't pay any attention. - Alright, dad. I know a boy who ate three quarter ice cream by himself. 'Now if he did he's sick now.' Oh, no he isn't. I feel fine. Oh, hello, Sid. Ah, good evening. Oh, Sid, come in. - Good evening. - Good evening. It's a beautiful evening. Sit down, Sid. I never saw a more beautiful sunset.. Oh, pardon. I'm sorry, Lily. Deeply sorry. It's alright. This isn't blue fish by any chance is it, my dear? Of course not. I regret to say that there is certain peculiar oil in blue fish that invariably poisons me. [laughing] I don't see anything darn funny about my being poisoned. Uh-uh! Nat, I suspect the plot. This fish looks blue to me. Very blue. Despondent in fact. Yeah. Can it be that your Essie has been slowly poisoning you for years? That this woman is a.. [babbling] ...eh, Lucretia Borgia? See here you darn fool a joke's a joke and enough is enough. Is it true, Essie? Yes, it is. And that peculiar oil business is all nonsense. Well, now, kindly allow me to know my own constitution. You've been eating blue fish for years and thrived on it. To think of it I have felt upset every darn time we've had fish. I can't eat this. You seem to be in a merry mood. I thought you were the original of a hard Bob down today. (Essie) 'Sid, what's wrong now?' [babbling] Water. What will they think of next. I regret to say that this is a certain peculiar oil in water that invariably poisons me. You seem to be getting a lot of fun out of kidding me go ahead. Ow! He better go to bed. That's what he better do. Yeah, bed. Maybe you're right. I lost my fish. I regret that I must tear myself away. But I do not seem to fit in this company. If you'll forgive my saying so. You are all slightly intoxicating. Would you go to bed, idiot. First I have a duty to perform. Lily, once and for all answer me. - Will you marry me? - No, I won't. - Never. - Right. Perhaps it's all for the best. For how can I forget, what my dear old mother once said to me. Sydney she said, "never marry a woman who drinks." Hmm, too bad. So fine a woman once and now a slave to rum. You leave Lily alone and go to bed. Yeah. Well, goodnight, ladies and gents. We will meet by and by. Bye bye. Huh, goodness he's a caution. That's just it. That's been his downfall everyone always laughing at him. Saying he's case he's a caution. And he's gone on and we're all responsible. We're all to blame. And all we do is laugh. No, now, Lily. It isn't as serious as that. Well, maybe it is to me. Or was. Was. [crying] Well, what's all that about? Oh, Sid promised to take her to the fireworks. You know what I think. It's Aunt Lily's fault. It's because he loves her. And she keeps him dangling after and eggs him on and ruins his life, like all women try to ruin men's lives. I don't blame him for drinking himself to death the way she's treated him, I'd do the same thing if I were him. "Drink for you know not when you come nor why. Drink for you know not where you go not when." That's enough of that. I've had about all I can stand for one day now you keep that darn fool talk to yourself, okay? You're gonna regret it. You ought to be ashamed of yourself talking that way.. - ...on the fourth of July. - Fourth of July. I wish we still belonged to England. - Hey, Dick. - Oh, hiya, Wint. Tell Art I wanna see him on the QT. He isn't home and won't be back until late. Doggone it! That gums up the works for fair. Why? What's wrong with you? - Can keep your mouth shut? - I can. I ran into a couple of swift babies from New Haven this.. And I dated them up tonight thinking I could get Art. Nearly broke I can't afford to blow 'em both to drinks. I got $11 you can borrow some money if that's what you want? Ah, Nicks, kid. I don't want your money. Say do you have anything on for tonight? - No. - Like to come along with me? Take one of them off my hands. You don't even have to take a glass of beer - Unless you want to. - What'd you think I am? A rube? You mean you're game for anything? Sure I am. Can you fix it so your folks wont' know? I don't want your dad after me. Oh, don't worry about that. - Lets go. - Okay. Come on. [instrumental music] I don't want them to think you're a high school kid. - Whatever I say back me up. - Sure. Haven't been around this part of town have you, kid?

(male #2) 'What kind of beer will you have, sister?' (Belle) 'Mine's a gin rickey, mister.' 'You've got extravagant taste, I'm sorry to say.' 'Hey, waiter, two gin rickeys.' - 'Smoke?' - 'Sure.' [mellow music] Hey, cut out the noise. - What's up with you? - It's none of my business. If I were you, I'd show him the gate. He's underage. Any fool could see that. - He said he's over 18. - Yeah. I'd say I'm ten. You don't have to believe me. Go on now. On your way now. Don't start no trouble in here. Beat it. - I will not beat it. - Oh, won't you? There's one way to get him to hush, give him the rush. Come on, come on. - Let me go. - Come on. [indistinct chattering] [mellow music] Poor kid. Hope he makes it home alright. I liked him a lot. Before he got tight. - Who is he? - Name's Miller. His old man runs a paper in this one horse town he said. He must be Nat Miller's kid then. Brother are you dead. He's on his way. We're the good boot to help him. Yeah, well maybe that boot will cost me my job, sister. Miller'll run me outta town if he finds out I served his kid. - Why didn't you put me wise? - I don't stand for that talk. Not from some hick beer squirter like you. You don't? Who told me to put the dynamite in that fizz? Beat it quick or I'll have you run in. I'll fix you for this if I've to go to jail. This is one lady you can't touch. Oh, I can't, can't I? Come on get out of here. Come on, go on get out. Come on. Now, get out and stay out. [instrumental music] - Now, see here, young man. - Richard. Oh heavens, what's happened to him? He's gone crazy. No, he's not crazy. He's just soused. (Mr. Miller) 'You've got nerve, you fresh kid.' And then I will come with vine leaves in my hair. - How dare you-- - Don't strike him. Nat, don't ball him out now, he doesn't know what he's doing. He does not win.. ...who plays with sin. Richard. Mom. I feel rotten. - Oh. - Let me handle him, Essie. I know this game backwards. - Come on. - He does not win. Yeah, I know. - Vine leaves in my hair. - Alright now. Oh, vine leaves.. [instrumental music] Well, Sid. Oh, I don't know what's the matter with me today I can't seem to keep awake. This Richard thing is more serious than I thought. He was evidently out with some girl. Really? How do you know? I just got this letter on my desk, listen. "I was with your son last night and you ought to know "how he got the booze he drank at the Danville Beach club. "The bartender knew he was underage "and served him just the same. If I was you I'd have him run out of town." - Is it signed? - No. See if you recognize the handwriting? I resent the implication that I correspond with such girls. No, I don't know her. What're you gonna do? I'll just have to have a talk with Richard. I'd rather take a licking. It's the kinda thing he'd do in the state of mind he was just to spite Muriel. [instrumental music] Tommy. Tommy. Would you give this note to Richard? I'm busy. Give it to him yourself. 'I can't I'm locked in.' - Are you in distress? - Yes. I'll come and rescue you. No, no. Just give this to Richard. - It's a secret message. - Alright. [instrumental music] I'll give it him over my dead body. Good. I just called seven men, sheriff. Which way they go? How many times have I told you to knock before you come in? Stop that and get out of here. I bring you a secret message. Tommy, I'm not in a mood to play. Would you leave, please? Alright then, I'll bring my message elsewhere. What've you got there? - A secret message. - What is it? Girlie smelly stuff. - Give that to me. - You didn't want it. Give it to me. Tommy, give me that letter. Get out from underneath that bed. Stop it now. I'm stuck. Will you stop that? Ouch! Ow. Now, get off that bed. Hurry up. What's it say? She says she still love me, always will no matter how much she gets punished. Is that all? I thought it was something important. She's gonna try and sneak out tonight wants me to meet her at the brook at 9 o' clock. I'm not so sure I'll keep that date. You can't. You're not allowed out. I'll get out alright. In fact I'll leave right now. And don't you say anything to anybody about this, understand? You have awful long time to wait. Oh, I could wait a million years for her. The trouble is you don't know what love means. What does it mean? Go on, get out, will you? (Dave) '"Jam nine cents, butter 12 cents, broom six cents.' What's this 17 cents for? - That's cabbage, dear. - Cabbage? "Beans five.. [coughing] "Flour 25 cents. 'What's this 25 cents for flour?' (Mrs. McComber) 'Yes, dear.' [instrumental music] [music continues] Dick. Oh, hello. Is it 9 o' clock already? Time passes by quickly when you're thinking. I'll bet you'd forgotten I was even coming. No I haven't forgotten. But I was thinking about life. I'm afraid I can only stay a few minutes. There you go again. Always being afraid. Dick Miller, you've got a lot of nerves to say that after all the risks I've run making this date. Then sneaking out. You didn't take the trouble to send me any letter. I thought after the first letter that everything was dead and past between us. Papa made me write it. He stood over me and made me. If you only knew how I suffered. - Well, I've suffered too. - The despair in my soul. Something was dead in each of us. And what was dead was hope that was me. The hope of my happiness was dead. [mellow music] Gee, Muriel. It's so wonderful to be with you again. I'm glad it makes you happy. I'm happy too. Come, Muriel. Come with me. I wanna look at you. I wanna drink in your beauty. You don't know what I've been through. What I'm in for, for sneaking out. What I did last night. - What your letter made me do. - What did it make you do? I wanted to die. I sat brooding about death. Then I finally decided. - To kill myself. - You didn't. I said, when I'm dead she'll be sorry she ruined my life. And if you had I'd have died too. Honest I would. But suicide is the act of a coward. That's what stopped me. Beside I said to myself she isn't worth it. That's a fine thing to say! You wouldn't be worth it if what you said in that letter was true. I thought to myself I'm through with women. I'll forget about her and lead the pace that kills. So, after it got dark I sneaked out. I met a Princeton halfback I know and we went to the Danville Beach Club. Oh, not there. That's the only place where you get drinks. - We had a few high balls. - You didn't. And then the girls wanted champagne. So, I bought a round or two. What girls? Couple of college girls from New York. One said that she had fallen in love with me. - Insisted upon kissing me. - And did you kiss her? Well, what if I did? Once or twice. Oh, you. I hate you. - Muriel, wait a minute. - Let me go. - Listen to me. - I don't wanna listen. I'm going home. I never wanna lay eyes on you again. - Listen to me. - Let me go. - Muriel, please. - Let me go. Stop. Stop that. Will you stop that. Ouch! Alright, go ahead. I hate you too. I'll go back to Belle. - Go ahead! - You're a fine one. When it was all your fault, you ripped me outta my life forever. Shouldn't have been stupid to believe it. How was I to know? I only kissed her 'cause I was trying to get even with you. I told her I was in love with you and couldn't love anybody else ever but you. You did? I-I'm sorry I hurt your hand. Oh, that was alright, that's nothing it felt grand even to have you bite. There that'll cure it. We shouldn't fight. You shouldn't waste that on my hand. Please. Could I have one kiss? Will it wash off all her kisses? Wipe away the memory forever? I should say it would. Well then. Alright. [mellow music] The moon is beautiful tonight. Not as beautiful as you. Nothing could be. [music continues] Oh, poor you. Will your father punish you something awful? Oh, I don't care. You are my love, mine own souls. Nothing could have kept me from seeing you tonight. I'd have even crawled over a red hot coals. [music continues] Gosh, but I love you. Won't it be wonderful when we're married? Wonderful. [laughing] Oh, this Bernard Shaw's a comical cuss. Although his ideas are crazy they oughtn't allow them to be printed. You pretend to read those books out of duty to Richard when your nose has been glued to the page. I'm glad Tommy told us where Richard had gone. I'd have worried if he hadn't. He still has to be punished for last night. I think he's been punished enough. After the way I gave him a good piece of my mind. If he's with Muriel, we know he's alright. Thought you didn't like Muriel. Thought she was stupid. Well, so I did. But if Richard wants her.. Ma used to say you weren't over bright. She changed her mind when I didn't care about it. - Well, I'd been bright-- - Muriel's real cute-looking. I have to admit that. I clean forgot how dead set against it old man McComber is. Was. Met him up street this afternoon he was meek as pie. Backed out and he said he guessed I was right. I don't think you've to scold Richard, Nat. He told me he's never gonna drink again. Well and there's something else besides drinking. What do you mean something else? Well, discipline. There's got to be discipline. 'Hello, Richard.' Hello. - You don't think he's been.. - No. That's not liquor, that's love. Well, here goes. Be careful. Remember what happened last night because you were cross with him. I can see where this's gonna work around to where it's all my fault. - Richard. - Oh, yes pa. Sit down, Richard. Well, how are the vine leaves in your hair this evening? I don't know, pa. Turned out to be poison ivy, didn't they? - I was an awful fool. - You sure were. A stupid down right disgusting fool. Good thing Muriel didn't see you last night. No girl wants to give her love to a stupid drunk. I know, pa. Well, guess that settles the booze end of it so.. ...but, there's something else Richard that's more serious. How about this girl you were with last night at Danville Beach Club? You, you know about her? Yeah, yeah I know about her. What happened? Nothing very much. We had a few drinks and talked a little bit. I got drunk and the bartender threw me out. And I came home. That's all that happened? That's all, honest. - How'd you meet this girl? - I can't tell you that. I'd have to snitch on somebody and you wouldn't want me to. No, I don't suppose I do. Well, I believe you and that settles that. But, uh, listen here, Richard. Uh, it's about time that you and I had a serious talk about uh.. Well, certain matters pertaining to.. Now that the subject has come up with it's own accord it's a good time I mean.. Well, there's no use procrastinating further so, here goes.. Richard, you've now come to the age when well, you're a man in a way and it's only natural that.. Well, what I'm trying to say is that uh.. Well, you'll be out a lot with girls and uh.. Human society being organized as it is there'll be a certain conduct that'll be expected of you and uh, well, you just can't.. That is unless you're a scoundrel, which you're not. But, uh, well, there are certain women I mean uh.. Girls that uh, well.. It's only natural for you.. And I suppose they're pretty enough in a way.. But that doesn't mean that you have to get mixed up with them. Seriously. You see we're talking facts, Richard and uh.. Now, don't think that I'm encouraging you to. I don't want you to think that uh.. Well, here's what I'm driving at, Richard. Are they're after, I mean.. Well, you're whole life might be ruined. And uh, well, you.. You got to know how to evaluate I mean uh.. What I mean to say is uh.. It's alright, pa. It's alright. Here, drink, drink this. Of course I'll admit that I'm no authority but.. I-I never got mixed up with that kinda women and.. It'll be a heck of a side better if you never did. I'm not going to, pa. You know how much I love Muriel. - You know I wanna marry her. - That's fine. By golly, I'm proud of you when you talk like that. Well, I guess that's the end of that, huh? Yeah, there's nothing more to say. Hey, what's this? That was my Abraham Lincoln. [mellow music] Some more lemonade, Lily? Yes, dear. Oh. I don't see how you could want anything better than this. Oh, you're right, Lily. You're darn right. [music continues] Where's Mildred? Out walking with her latest. And Arthur's with Elsie Rand. Hmm, of course. We seemed to be completely surrounded by love. [laughing] Well, we've had our share, haven't we? We don't have to begrudge it to our children. I think I'll go out for a little while. It's such a beautiful night. Yes, I can remember only a few nights that were as beautiful as this and that was long ago when your mother and I were young and planning on getting married. Those must have been beautiful nights too, dad. You sort of forget that the moon was the same way back then...and everything. [chuckles] You're alright, Richard. Goodnight, mom. Goodnight, dear. - Goodnight, pa. - Goodnight, son. First time he's done that in years. I don't believe in kissing between fathers and sons after a certain age. It seemed mushy and silly, but, that meant something. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Love is young dream. What did that Rubaiyat says? "Yet, ah! That Spring should vanish with the rose! That youth's sweet-scented manuscript should close." Well, spring isn't everything, is it, Essie? [music continues]
