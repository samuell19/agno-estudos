- Hi, I'm Robbin. - What's happening? - Nothing. - Nice ma'am. - Thanks. - My name's Dino. Well, I guess you probably thought I was going to do something juvenile back there like - Peel out, or something like that. - No. - You didn't think that? - No I didn't. You were right. - How far you going? - Oh well I'm...just sort of going... - Just sort of grooving along, eh? - Yeah. Hey listen... I got this friend who's got this wild pad, it's down La Hoya, right there on the beach you know, it's situated on the sand where... Kinda like out there, and it's really nice. Except I don't ball. That's cool. Can't blame me for taking a shot at it, though can you? No, just spare me your mating ritual. I can't understand why nymphomaniacs never hitchhike. It's unbelievable. Would you mind letting me out? I'd like to get out of the car. Stop and let me off, please. Now this is really starting to get grim. Jesus, I can't believe it. Why don't you relax a little bit. Take some snow. I got some behind the tape deck. - Go ahead. - No thank you. I can't handle it. I can't believe it. If you can't handle it, you can't handle it. It's all right. Hey man, you're really scaring me, you know. Hey, just leave the driving to us, all right! Well, looks like we picked up a cop. It was bound to happen the way that you're driving. Whoa there buddy. Pull over. - Relax kid. - Look man, you're really scaring me. look, will you stop the car and let me out here! - Don't worry about it. - You're driving like an absolute fool. - I said pull over. - Will you let me get out of the car?! Knock it off. Just relax. He's history. I said pull over. Unit 2. I've got a 5-10 heading north. I need assistance. Go ahead, unit 2. It's a hotted-up yellow, model A, 209 BHI. See if it's hot, Molly. Because we wouldn't want to disturb lover boy's lunch now, would we? What did I do? It's clear. How close is the car to where the road repair work is going on? - Coming right up to it. - Get an ambulance over there right away. I said get an ambulance over there right away! Hey man, look out for those people! Look out! - Are you all right? - Yeah, never mind me, I... Better take a look at him because I think he's really hurt. Give me your hand. - Are you going to be all right? - Yeah, I think so. That boyfriend of yours must be some kind of smart ass. He wasn't my boyfriend. I was just hitching a ride with him. - Is he going to be all right? - He was never all right. Hey, look what I found in the glove compartment. Better let him get patched up and then book him. - What about the girl? - She looks under age. Probably a runaway. Let me see your ID, miss. You know every time you hitchhike you leave yourself open to this kind of thing. - Long way from home, eh? - Yes. Here. - That mean I'm free to go? - You can go. Thank you. - Aren't you going to book her? - I got all we need. Now where the hell is that chick going? If she keeps on walking she'll be on private property! As long as she stays on the beach, she'll be all right. One thing you've got to learn son, property owners don't see it that way. - And Rick, about this cocaine... - What? Make damn sure it all gets to the lab. Don't start that all over again. I said all of it. ♪ Who can tell us why...

Falling asleep on the beach can be dangerous, young lady. It's nearly high tide. You're just in time. Thank you. You saved my life. - I can't see you in the light. - My name is Jason Henry, and I live up there. And this is your beach and I'm a trespasser. Only in a manner of speaking. Is that all you've had to eat today? Yeah I guess so. Even the birds didn't want it. How would you like to come up to the house and have a proper meal? - That's a new approach. - I'm sorry? - If you'd rather be alone, I... - No, really. if you're using reverse psychology on me, it's working. I'm not using any kind of psychology at all. You don't live up there all by yourself, do you? No, with my sister. That makes the world of difference, doesn't it? I'm Robbin Stanley. How do you do? Come this way. Modern Day Walden, what a nice place to escape to. - Grace? - Oh. You startled me. - Robbin Stanley, this is my sister, Grace. - Hello. How do you do? I've invited Robbin to have dinner with us. - I don't know if I've have enough... - Needn't be anything fancy. - Look, maybe I'm imposing. No, I can always... - Of course you're not. Is she Grace? No of course not. It won't be any trouble. Good. I'm starved. Why don't you two go into the living room and I'll call you when everything's ready. This way, Robbin. Jason? The living room is in there. I'll be with you in minute. What is it, Grace? Jason, I thought we agreed you weren't going to bring anymore girls here. It's all right, dear sister. No, it is not all right. Now will you please get rid of that girl? - Will you please stop it? - No, I will not stop it. I like her. Can you understand that? I like her. - You like her. Yes, I'm sure you do. - Leave her alone. Please try not to spoil it for once. Just this once. - Jason, with you, it is always once. Just this once! - You play? - No. - What about your sister? - No, she doesn't play either. It's just a decoration. One that I'm growing less fond of by the minute. Hey, they may be funny to make a tour? Outta sight! - Yes, they are quite amusing. - They're unreal! Look at that. You know we get sunsets here that no painter could improve upon. - Oh yes, let me take your... - Poncho. Thank you. Just secondary sexual characteristics. You know my generation used to frown on such things. Oh really? I mean a bod is a bod. It's all up her. Whatever you want to think of it. And don't make yourself out to be so old because... I bet you're dynamite. This tote bag indicates that you're a traveller of sorts. I travel lightly. My worldly possessions. I've been on my own for a while. My younger brother Michael. He's dead. Tell me about your family. There's nothing to say about my family. I can hardly believe that. This is great! I'll try not to drool over it! You know at one time I might have fitted your description... ... dynamite! Let's say that since I've exploded! There you go again. You're using that reverse psychology and it's working. Oh, wow... This is beautiful ! Hey, did you take these? It's only a hobby! They're great. My only vice. You might say that I'm a frustrated photographer. Wait till I show you my studio downstairs! Oh, that's so beautiful! And to think that my friends think that another day-glo is where it's at! Yeah, every... every picture tells a story! Every picture tells a story. Yes, I like that. You know you're very good for my ego, young lady. Show me the memories and I can tell you all about them. - Who said that? - Who? - I did. - That makes two of you. - What do you mean? - You and Oscar Wilde. Oscar Wilde! Heavily read before my time. Okay, let me see. 'The Transformation', 'The Open and Closed Mind'... 'Poetry and the Principle', by Victor Hugo, 'Siddartha' and... And what have you divined, young lady? That you have a great span of interests, and I see that you Yes. And the occult! - And? - And... And all of a sudden you're eighteen year old girl. You know it's amazing at the amount of things you collect from different visitors over the years. Why don't we go for a walk ? Before dinner. Work up an appetite. My appetite doesn't need working up but I'd love to take a walk. Good. let's go. It's all so fresh and clean here. All right. Out with it. I don't know what you mean. Oh yes, yes you do. What about Grace? Grace isn't well. And I don't mean physically. Our parents died when we were quite young. There were three of us then. We were extremely close. Then Michael was killed in the automobile accident. Grace took it very hard. Now she feels I'm all she has to live for. So, if she seems, well, unfriendly or overprotective, it's because she's deluded herself into thinking that...she's well. And I am the one who is sick. Thank you. I didn't know I was so hungry. Well... tell me, what brings you to Arrow Beach, Miss Stanley? Please call me Robbin. I was thumbing. You know, hitchhiking. - From Los Angeles... - Isn't that rather dangerous? It's free. I mean, looking at it this way, right, If I hadn't got stuck here, I never would have met you two. We are very flattered. What about your parents? We've already discussed that. Look, it's all right, Jason. I mean everybody always asks me about my parents. I come from the east. and my stepfather is a well-natured drunk, And my mom... Let's see how I can describe her... I think that once there was a lot of love between us that somehow got lost along the way. I mean right before I split I got the feeling that all I meant to her was twenty-seven and a half food stamps a month. How long have you been on your own? I spent one month in Laurel Canyon. Altogether, about ten months. I suppose you miss work from time to time? I get by. You'd really be surprised at how little one actually needs. Do your parents know your whereabouts? No. They haven't a clue. I mean, it's no big deal because nobody really cares. Oh. Don't get me wrong, I mean I'd like to belong to somebody. Jason, where does she live now? Now Grace, please don't start again. What's wrong with having a visitor once in a while? Jason, yeah, I bet you asked her. Grace and I were just discussing that it might be nice - if you'd like to spend the night. - I intended to. Well, that's settled. I mean the idea of a hot water bath just really turns me on. Good. I'll just be a moment. You don't eat very much, do you? I'm on a diet and Jason's a vegetarian. Vegetarian? Are you into any of that organic stuff? I mean you know, like bean sprouts or alfalfa or soy... Jason's kind of fond of succotash. We keep a few things frozen for guests. - Just put those in there. - Sure. Miss Stanley... Jason needs tranquility. So I'm afraid you're going to have to cut your visit short. - But Jason was the one that invited me. - Yes I know. Maybe Jason's problem is that he has too much tranquility. I know you mean well, Miss Stanley, but... I'm afraid you're quite incapable of understanding the problem. I'd like to think that... we'd all be concerned about each other. No-one can help Jason. So I think that the best thing you can do... Hey look... Now look, if you want me to split right now I can do it. It's all right. It's all right. - I wouldn't consider it... It's all right. - I'm sorry I broke your plate. It's all right. Excuse me. - I'll get a broom. - It's not in there. It's here. I'll get it. That door leads to the basement. We keep it locked because... Well, because... Because the stairs are very steep and quite dangerous. Do you have any liquid detergent, you know, which you'd use to wash dishes with? and I've been looking forward to a hot bubble bath all day long. Liquid deter... For what? Well, it's a fragrant bubble bath - I have some bubbles. - You do? Yes. A present from Jason. - What a gas! - Yes, it is. - I'll show Miss Stanley to her room. - I'll go and get your bubble bath. Thank you. I hope you'll be comfortable here. The bathroom, and there's a blanket in that chest if you get cold. I won't forget this place for a very long time. - Here's your bubble bath. - Oh, thank you. I'll see you in the morning. - Good night. - Night. Sleep well. We make it a rule in this house to lock all bedroom doors. It's nothing to be alarmed about. Just lock the door! - If it pleases you. - Yes, it does please me. All right, I'll do it then. - Good night, Robbin. - Good night, Grace. Jason? Jason! She's lovely, isn't she? I'm having a hard time playing jealous sister. On the contrary ! You do it very well! I'm not sure you mean that! Jason, why should I have to play-act at all? It's of your own choosing, isn't it? What ever I choose I choose for the both of us! Jason, you're my whole life since Michael died. You're everything I live for, and I won't let anything come between us. Nothing will ever come between us. I'm much more than a sister to you. Is it so awful living the way we do? You know better than that. Oh, Jason. Sometimes you say one thing and mean another. As you're referring to that girl I brought inside this afternoon. I promise you, she means nothing to me. And above all... it is absolutely nothing to do with you and me. Oh, how can you say that? It has everything to do with us. It cuts into my life. Oh Jason, I'm terrified. If ever you... - We'll lose everything. - Calm down, Grace. I just hate it when you lose control of yourself. This girl is a legal adult! She is here of her own free will! But you promised me. You promised me the last time we'd have no more girls up here. I told you not to worry about it! That girl will leave first thing in the morning. For Christ's sake Grace, get off my back. I just don't understand. We have everything we need. Income from the estate, the pension, the house. Why risk losing everything? That's what I don't understand, why risk losing everything? There, that's better. - Why two sleeping pills? - You've has quite a day. I almost out of them! I'll pick some more up when I go into town tomorrow. Jason, I'll drive with you. Good, then we'll have lunch together. Jason, that would be lovely. Good night, Grace. See you in the morning. By the way, Jason... - I had Robbin lock her door. - What? Good night darling. You could use some sleep too. I have some prints to develop first. All right. Suit yourself. Oh, Jason, one other thing. The chloroform you use will kill the plant in the hall. Good night, Grace! Hello, operator? Yes Jason, what's happened? - Good night everybody. See you in the morning. - Hey, sheriff. -Better take this. sounds important. - At this hour? Sheriff Bingham! Yeah. I'll drop by tomorrow morning. All right. Okay, Mr. Henry, I'll be right over. If it wasn't so close to election, I'd have told him to go to hell. Handcuff the dude. A vote is a vote, Lippencott. Don't you ever forget it. What kind of a name is Ape? Two making fudge! You got a way with words. How much money you got left, Ape? Come on now baby, I gotta see a little green! We can go to Canada, we already have a quarter. Come on, in the bar you said you had some loot. That's more like it. Come on baby, what's in the other pocket? The one very thing I like's in that pocket. What's in the other pocket? Will you help me please? I have to find the police. They'll find you quick enough. Please, will you tell me how I can talk to the police! Hey, cool it, baby! Look at that arm. Maybe you better go find a doctor. Sorry I can't help you. Last thing I need's another run in with the local fuzz. - I have to find the police. - Come on, let's go. See you baby. Try in there. They'll help you. Oh god, help me. Abby! I know, baby, but tomorrow is my day off. See, they need me. Why? Because we're under-staffed, that's why. Right. Tomorrow night. I'll make it all up to you. I promise. - Maynard. Maynard, quick. - What? Call an ambulance. Off you go. Stand back, stand back. Get the names, addresses, and all the details, huh. No, emergency. Can I have an ambulance over her right away. Look at those eyes. This girl's really got to be on a bummer. - Stop Jason... - Mick, give me your tie! Stop Jason... Okay, I'll take care of that in just a second. Everything's going to be all right. She keeps saying 'Jason'. What do you think that is? - The phone call. - Okay. I'm sorry to have kept you, Sheriff. but I was upstairs when you rang. It's very kind of you to come at this late hour. Forget it. Long hours are standard in my game. - A little excitement, huh? - Yes, I'm afraid so. Will you come this way? How is she, doctor? Well, there's always a threat of an O D with these kids. You never know what other drugs she's got in her system. - What do you think? - No scar. No scar. - I wasn't talking about that! That's not what I meant. All the symptoms were traumatic shock- incoherent babbling, dissociation. - She wasn't on any drugs? - I didn't say that. She could have been on Mescaline or PCP, that's an animal tranquilizer. Quaaludes, but none of these things show up in her blood tests. How about cocaine? We found cocaine in her possession earlier today. Yeah, cocaine could have done it. So, what do you want me to do with her? It all depends on Sheriff Bingham. What about her bill? My fee? That too depends on Sheriff Bingham. - Just send us a statement. - All right. Caucasian, brownish hair, about 5' 5". Late teens. Yes, how did you know? Don't you worry about a thing. It'll all work out. - Goodnight now. - Just one minute, Jason. Now exactly what nonsense has my brother been telling you about this girl? Supposing yell me, Miss Henry, exactly what happened. - Grace... you mustn't... - In your own words. If you really want it. You see, Mr Bingham, my brother is kind and generous to a fault. He'll pick up any stray and... and feed them. No doubt he told you this girl was pure and virginal. Poor Jason is hopelessly naive. I thought, Mr Bingham, she was on some sort of drug. She acted very peculiar. She was such a nice girl I... I just can't understand what happened to her. May I use your phone? Please do. Get me the sheriff's office. Are you willing to sign a complaint? Sign a complaint? Certainly not. But you should, Jason. - Hello, it's me. - To protect somebody else. - I will not. - What? You did? Right. No, that'll keep till tomorrow. See you in the morning. Right. They already has the girl in custody, Mr Henry. You haven't? Sheriff... Would you give this back to that girl? She left it here when she ran away. Of course. Aha! They say that she was definitely doped-up or coked-up, or... Then the matter is closed as far as we're concerned. I just hope she won't be bothering us again, Mr Bingham. She won't bother you again. You have my word on that. That's most reassuring. I'll let myself out. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Go back to bed now, Grace. - How did I do? You were perfect! I should have been an actress! - Goodnight Grace. - Goodnight Jason. No! How'd I get here? Everything is fine. Fuzz. Are you a doctor? Medical tech. How long have I been here? Well... Well, it says your name is Robbin Stanley, and by the way I'm Alex Heath. - Hi. - My pleasure. Come on, you can level with me here. Tell me what else it says, please! So, you're going to be okay. Come on man, what else does it say? You know, medical records. All that jive. Anyway, what do you care about this chart? You gotta remember what happened. It's true. I do remember. but there's parts I don't remember... You were pretty spaced when they brought you in here. I saw him standing there... and he had this kind of meat cleaver in his hand, and there was blood dripping down off the blade. I've never seen this before. It's definitely got to be some powerful stuff. She was clean zonked out of her head. Where's area code 203? - I believe it's Upstate, New York. - Give the number a call. - Molly? - Yeah? - You get me area code 203 8543970. - Right. What kind of an impression did Jason really make on you? Seemed like a nice enough guy. Distinguished discharge from the Air Force. You know, won the Silver Star. - I've got the party on the line for you. - Thank you. - Good morning, Jason. - Good morning. You're up bright and early. Just thought I'd go into town this morning. Do a bit of shopping. Did the sheriff call? I think we've heard the last of the sheriff. I'm seeing Mr. Bingham this evening. Oh? I've volunteered to work on his election campaign. Do you think that's a good idea? By going there you're really attracting attention to yourself! And to us. Jason, this is the first time the police have been involved. I just want to make sure that you're above suspicion. What happened to that girl? Probably they've...They've probably released her and she must have left town. I hope so ! A nice, sweet old lady. It was her mother. She said I if that tramp has got herself into trouble go ahead and throw the book at her. Talk about prisoner. Check and see if the kid has a record. I already have, and she's clean. - You know she's not such a bad one. - Yeah, I know, I know. Well, Mr. Henry won't press charges. I'm damned if I'm going to waste time and the tax payer's money booking her and some judge let her off on probation. Give her back her things, keep the evidence, and tell her to get the hell out of town. 'Dear mom, I hope they didn't take too big a slice. love, Dad'. I couldn't let them throw all this stuff out. It's pretty good. I shouldn't be eating so much candy. I mean, I'm supposed to be sick, right? Oh, candy is dandy! That's my prescription. Dr Denham, line six please, Dr Denham. This is an understaffed hospital. We have been looking for you for the last hour. Please, please, it's really all my fault. He's been such a great help to me since I've been here and not even one nurse or doctor's been in to see me. Oh? - Good morning. - What's good about it? Girl can't make an honest living anymore. Don't mind getting laid, but to be rolled as well! He ought to be behind bars. I'm not talking about those brutes. Excuse me, but who should be behind bars? That big Ape. He brought me down here last night, he got me stoned and he left me here. Shouldn't you try to be more selective? My bank account, such as it is, isn't filled on "selectivity". I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do? - Yeah, you can leave me alone. - Very well. Wait a minute. Don't go. Who are you anyway? My name is Jason Henry. I live up there. - Private beach. - Yes, but don't let that concern you. How about that. I'm Ginger. Ginger Tucker. - How do you do? - Delighted. I must say I'm a photographer. You will never believe this. You know I used to model! You know I could tell. I could tell immediately. How about that! You know I was the first girl to ever pose in two-piece bikini. Yeah, it was really daring in those days. You know, if you ever need a professional model, you know, my type, just let me know because you can always reach me at Tugboat Annie's. I'll try and remember that. Hey, you remember honey, there was Betty Rowlands, there was Gypsy Rose Lee, there was Lilly St Claire and me! We were the biggest. If you know what I mean! - Ginger Tucker, after all these years. - Hey, do you remember this pose? Of course I do. Hey, how would you like to pose for me right now? Right now? Like this? Oh sure, that's no problem. Well, I guess I could maybe get away with it. Hey, but nothing kinky though! No, just some head and shoulder shots. Come. my studio's in the house up there. I've been asked up to see people's etchings, but never this. - What a blast! - Come on. - How's the arm today? - it's okay, I guess. It doesn't hurt me very much. Good, then you can be released as soon as possible. My name is Deputy Rakes, I brought you here last night. - We met on the other day on the highway. - That's right. We don't seem to be meeting under the best of circumstances, do we? - No, we don't. - Thanks anyway for bringing me in. Doing my job. How'd you find my bag? Where'd you get it? Mr. Henry gave it to the sheriff. What did you find in that horrible house? - Have you arrested him yet? - Have we arrested Mr. Henry? - Definitely not. - You're putting me on? Look, I spent the worst night of my entire life in that house, and you're not going to stand there and tell me that you're not going to do anything about it! Essentially that's it. Look, you've got to believe me, now. That basement... I remember I broke the basement window. You're terrific! it was a back door window you shattered. No, it was in the basement... I'm sure if you looked in the basement... I pride myself on having an open mind. I mean it, and I believe that there are two sides to every issue. I told the sheriff that when we discovered the dope in your bag there, And the cocaine in your friend's car. Now let's just say that you've got convinced me, all right? And let's say that you broke the basement window? Now, are you willing to pay for it? - Never! - Why not? Because he tried to kill me. Are you accusing Jason Henry of trying to kill you? Well, he didn't actually try to kill me, he grabbed me. He grabbed you to strangle you? No, look, I was trying to escape through the back window... - You just said the basement. - That's right. I meant to say the basement. - But you just now said... - Look, I know what I just now said, but I meant to say the basement window. Now I tried to escape through the basement window and the man tried to grab my leg. He tried to grab your leg... but did he or didn't he? - Huh? - Well, no, actually he didn't... Actually he didn't grab your leg but... - He tried! - But he tried, huh? He tried to strangle your foot. Is that what you're trying to say? Look, you're not being funny, you're just trying to ridicule me. On the contrary, you're trying to ridicule the whole sheriff's department. Look, why don't you just forget the whole thing, and consider yourself very lucky the sheriff didn't book you. Believe me. Remember I told you he had a meat cleaver in his hand and there was blood dripping down off the blade. So now he's a butcher? Hey, you know what your problem is? You're trying to get by on personality. You're pulling a cute little lost girl routine just to get a lot of sympathy and attention. And that's exactly what you're doing. You're lying here in a comfortable bed and you're eating the best of food, and you're being taken care of by a very nice nurse... And you're full of shit! I want you to leave Arrow Beach as soon as you get your release, you understand, or I'll personally see that you're jailed and arrested. Now that's a promise. Unbelievable! So I just split and the people in that house groove away? And you peek in windows and the world spins on! - Oh wow! - That's the way it is. Okay great. I can't wait to get the hell out of here! Of course there's the bill you're going to have to take care of. Just another shaft for the taxpayers. So there's nothing keeping me here, right? You hand this over to the driver of the Greyhound Bus. It'll take you to San Diego. Would you make that Connecticut? It's farther away! You transfer in San Diego. Don't forget my promise! Well, what happens now? I've been ordered out of Arrow beach or else... Those bastards! I've got no choice. look, it's not much but why don't you come and stay at my place? It's too risky now! Maybe... Maybe I could come back one day. Yeah, sure. You know I really feel bad 'cause you know you're never going to come back. But anyway, for what it's worth, I live in apartment 1, number 1, 1st street. 111. That easy to remember? I'll tell the landlady to let you in, just in case. I don't do change my mind, Alex. Well, now that we have our personal problems worked out, maybe we can get back to work. Right Alex? What a shame we can't work out your personal problems that easy! Wait a second. Oh yeah, Philodex. Definitely not, you know, up, up and away. Are you sure? It's important. I'm positive. Look, it was only used briefly, I think, by the Air Force a long time ago, in the South Pacific. - I used to dispense it. - That's impossible. I took it off a 20 year old girl. Well, I guess your 20 year old girl was in the Air Force at the close of the Korean War. I am the dumbest! Hey, don't look so sad. At least now we're even. I've got to give this some serious thought. What's the matter? What did they say? Marty said that girl that we ran out of town wasn't on any stuff. Now that's what he said. II am so happy. I feel like... Get a hold of yourself, Ginger! Now these are just going to be head and shoulder shots, and I'd like you to lower your blouse a little for me, just to reveal your shoulder. Oh yeah. Like that? Yes, that's perfect. Get a light meter reading. You are so sweet to me, you know. I can't begin to tell you the happiness this brings me, just... doing my own thing. That's all I ever really wanted. This is really a struggle after my lying empty on the beach like that. - It was so crazy. - Just give me your coffee cup. This is an automatic camera. This is an automatic! What I'd like you to do, on that stool, just revolve around. All the way around. I'll let you get into profile, then I'll get a back view, then we get the other profile and we come right back into camera. Do you understand what I'm going to do? Right, now, just for the rehearsal, just glow within. I just want to check though, okay? All right, now revolving. Turn... turn...turn... Turn! Very good. Excellent. Now come back again! Now, Ginger... remember the old times. Remember the '50s. Remember when you really modelled? Now give all you've got. I want joy, I want happiness. I want lust, I want sex. I want everything! Okay. Are we ready? Right. Go! Turn... turn... turn...turn... Turn... turn... turn... To continue to protect you and your loved ones, and to keep out those elements creeping into our towns and cities that disturb the productive and peaceful coexistence of our daily lives. - You meant what you said, Miss Henry. - Well of course I did. - Glad to have you with me. - A few questions, sheriff. A few questions, sheriff? Young People's Press. I'm not too excited by underground newspapers. We're still interested in your views. I doubt they's have ant influence on many people around here. What do you want to know? What is your position on off shore oil drilling? Against. What is your candid opinion about busing? Against. We're specifically interested on your thought on abortion. against. Would you have any comment to make at this time on porno? - Against... - Nudity? Against. Well, just what are you for? Get your pencil ready. I'm for anything that's American.. I'm against... anything that will weaken the moral fibre of this great country of ours. You're not writing. Oh, I'll remember that. Got it all tucked away up here. Tucked away where? Well, thank you. - Did you walk over here, Miss Henry? - Yes, it's not very far. My deputy will escort you home. - Thank you. - Oh, yeah. Oh Maynard, I know you so well and you've been acting very weird. I hate to say it but I think you have guilt written all over your face. Yeah, that's just bullshit! Molly, get me Brian at the bus station. Look, she's probably halfway back east now, so cool it. Brian got off work at three. Nope. No-one matching that description while I was ion duty. Tell him to call me the minute he comes in. Put him through from the office here. - You know where I'll be, Molly. - Sure do. Oh yeah? Not unless you shape up, buster. You're a riot, you are! Come on. Coach 2507 bound for Los Angeles and San Fransisco, now departing. She was supposed to leave town today. Maybe she didn't. I want to go to dinner. Who would be very surprised if that young woman would do as she's told? You wouldn't have any idea if she had friends or relatives around these parts, would you? Oh, one pretty good idea... Alex Heath's apartment. Wait a minute, I'll get his address for you. Thank you. You may not give a damn about your one day off, but I certainly do! Please. This could be very important. Important? what about me?! Obviously I'm not. Look, I'm going to go to dinner this minute with or without you. Good and if you like, I'll drive you! Here is my card. You will know where to reach me. Please call if the girl shows up, or the boy. It's very urgent. Oh Maynard, there's nothing wrong. Seriously. So much for putting in effort. That was a lovely walk. Yes. - Please stay for tea. - Oh, no thank you. I've got to get back to work. - Thank you. - I'll let myself out. All right. 'Night. Women! You look comfortable, Jason. Was there any mail? No, nothing important. How did you enjoy your political rally? Oh, it was very interesting. It was fun. Jason, I think it's good for me to get involved... from time to time. - Did the sheriff mention anything about Robbin? - No, not a word! The cut on my arm opened up again today. Jason, did you up meet someone on the beach today? As a matter of fact I did meet somebody while I was taking a walk. - Another young girl, I suppose? - Hardly a young girl. - An accidental meeting? - Please, Grace. Stop worrying. You are trying to spare me. It isn't any better, is it, Jason? - Grace, I promised you and I... -Jason, did you bring that girl here? No, I did not. - It's starting all over again, isn't it? - No, it is not. It is all over and done with. Finished! No more intruders. We just have ourselves, now. Oh, Jason, I love it when you talk like that. I mean it this time, Grace. Then... would you go to the army clinic with me? I've been considering it. Oh, Jason, it'll be the bravest thing you've ever done. Thank you very much, sir. You're a doll. Hello, I'm Robbin Stanley, the girl Alex told you about. Oh yes, I've been expecting you. Come this way. Come in. Alexander had to go to Lacuna today. Have a seat, girl. - He said to let you in if you came by. - Thank you. - anything you want, you just call now. - Thank you. - Alex! - Wow! welcome to Arrow Beach! Hello, is this the Harbour restaurant? - May I speak to Deputy Rakes, please? - I'm sorry, he hasn't come in yet. Would you give him a message for me? Hey, this was really great, Robbin. I'm sorry this place was in such a mess! we're going to beat this damn beach! You know... it really must be so groovy having a place all your own. - I like it. - You're lucky. you really are. - The hospital was a bummer. - Why don't you stick here for a while? Did you forget? I have no choice. Robbin, I don't care why you stay, just as long as you stay. Hey, Robbin... there's something that's been bothering me and I'm... I'm going to have to risk spoiling everything by asking about it. - Do have to? - It's been bugging me. Well, then let's talk about it. Look, what ever that stuff was you took the other night it could be very dangerous and I just hope you never do it again. What stuff? Alex, what is this stuff that everybody knows about but me? Robbin, it's kind of hard to deny. They found it in your tote bag. Will you just tell me what it was? There was no mention of any specific drug, just a drug and a syringe. Anyway, it's the works that scare me. Alex... I have never owned or used a syringe in my life. really! The strongest stuff I've ever been on is grass. Look, Alex, if I used a spike, right, I'd have tracks. Look, there's no tracks here and there's no tracks here. You don't believe me. Robbin, I believe you, but the places that a woman could inject herself with a syringe defy the imagination. You're right. I never thought about it. That's why I said something was bugging me. Well, it's pretty obvious ! That creep Jason, he... he put it there! He put it there so that the police would think that... that I was on ice and that I was stoned out of my brain! - And they bought the story. - Wait a minute. Are you saying it was planted in your tote bag by Jason Henry? I can't think of any other way that it could have got in there. Let's get this straight. Now you left your tote bag at the house and Jason Henry gave it to the police, - and then Rakes returned it to you? - That's the way that it was.. Just don't get over how well it all worked. It doesn't say much for the police! Wait a minute. Don't be too hard on them. - Maybe you didn't tell them everything. - I did tell them everything! Now look, Jason Henry went to an awful lot of trouble to try and frame me. You know what I think? I think Jason Henry is kills people! Girls people! You know what I think? I think maybe he was just trying to get in your knickers. - Will you please be serious! - Oh, do I have to be? You know one of the main reasons why I came back here? Sure, couldn't keep your eyes off me. Right... And I'm also going back to that basement. Tonight. You're what? Oh, Maynard Rakes just arrived. He's at the second table in the back room. Thank you. Maynard got a telephone call from an Esther Simpson. She said to call right away. Here's the number. I'll tell him when he gets back from the men's room. she said it was very important. Don't worry. I'll tell him right away. Would I keep something important from him? - What are you doing here? - What do you mean, what am I doing here? Got bored down that leaky old row. Thought I'd come in a little early.. Deputy Rakes called. He wanted to know if you noticed the young girl this morning? - What was her name? - Robbin Stanley. Robbin Stanley? Wanted to know if you noticed her boarding the bus. Robbin Stanley? She's that... Yeah, she's that, she's that... Yeah! Yeah! Robbin Stanley. She had her own ticket. wild looking girl. yeah, I remember her. - You actually saw her? - Yeah. - She got on the bus this morning? - Sure did. - What's it all about? - I don't know but it's huge. Sheriff's office. Hello. Ah, having a little belt at the grapes, are we? - Aren't you sweet. - Brian called in. The girl did board the bus, the bus did depart with her on it. Great. Here we go. It's got to be one of these windows or I'm losing my mind. Come on. I'm telling you, it's true! This is the last one. That settles it, Robbin. None of these windows have been broken. Look, you've got to believe me. Hey Robbin, this is blood! I ought to know, I clean up enough of it! - It cut me when it broke. - Oh, that settles it. we're going to break in to this damn cellar. Well I doubt if Jason's going to invite us in! - Where are we? - In his studio! - My god! - Hey no... take it easy. - What the hell was that? - Stop yelling, he'll hear. - Where? - In behind there. His dark room. - Guess we better take a look. - No! There's that sound again. Let's get out of here. We'll go to the police. Are you kidding?! Get police help? We're too far to back out now. Hey, come on. I can't walk. You're strangling me! No! He... couldn't... couldn't help himself. ♪ Who can tell us why...
