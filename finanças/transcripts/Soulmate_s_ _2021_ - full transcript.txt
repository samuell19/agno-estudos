How about Moose saunters down Main Street, causing no traffic jams 'cause there's no cars on the road? [scoffs] I don't know. This is kind of the dumps. I just need to finish my OP ED so I can get a real writing job. At least you're getting paid for this one, right? Mm, kind of. I mean she's paying me in banana bread. [doorbell jingles] Sam, you promised you'd get paid for the article this time. I know, but at least it's a job. Jess: I'm not sure it's a job if you're not getting paid. [sighs] What am I going to do with you? Sam: Well at least my notary gig pays the bills for now. Woo, hot guy alert. [laughs] I don't think I heard you correctly. Sam: There aren't any hot guys here. Jess: Well that moose had a nice caboose. [laughs] You just rhyme with me, smoosh. Coming round the corner. Hop on Doctor Seuss. You just rhymed with me again, baba ganoush.

Ooh, I want some coffee cake. Yum. Peterson Maple can singlehandedly destroy Vermont's maple syrup industry with their fancy technology. They're like a big bully on the playground. You know, I heard Peterson spent a quarter of a million on one evaporator. We should bring our baseball bats and smash it as it comes out of the truck. Peaceful protest, dear. We're not stooping to their level. You know, Sam's going to start off her OP ED piece at the protest. I am so proud of you for taking this on Sam. It's kind of a big undertaking for me, but I'm really excited. Suzie. Writing an article is an example of peaceful protest. I am still packing my bat. That's my girl. [laughs] Peterson thinks that they can just march in here and start mass producing. They have clearly never met Vermonters. - True dat. - Yeah. Definitely not. Oh. Speaking of which, we stopped by the family farm. Hell yeah. Pass me the sweet stuff. [baby talk] Look who wants some sweet stuff? Look who it is everybody, it's Gonzales.

Oh, but we're not. [groans] ♪ So the only reason that the GMO law passed is because I led the rally. And I didn't give you a ticket for that one either. I have a first amendment right. But you can't do it on other people's property. I heard he's had a crush on her since high school. And the one time he gave her a ticket, he ended up paying for it himself. Himself!

That's really sweet. I'm Jessamine. Landon. I'm Sam. Apparently I won't be saying no to a free drink. So what's this all about? There has to be a good story here. Oh yeah. We were actually just protesting this horrible corporation that's trying to take over the Vermont maple industry. Horrible huh? Pure evil. That's pretty harsh now. No. [laughs] We actually know what we're talking about. I'm actually writing an article about it right now, so I've been doing a lot of research. Hmm. I heard they were creating demand for maple internationally, which will drive demand for Vermont maple. But they're taking over family farms with a cold steel factory. Factories are more energy efficient. [laughs] Okay, um... Something tells me you're not from around here. I did just move up here from Connecticut. [spits] You work for Peterson Maple? As a matter of fact I do. As a matter of fact, I don't need to take this beer from you. Listen. If you want an insider interview for your article, I live on my boat on Lake Champlain. I'd love to speak with you ladies further. Of course you live on Lake Champlain and have a boat. Like all of the rich out-of-staters. Would you like my card? Um, thanks. How about tomorrow for the interview? Um, I think that sounds great. Yeah. You know what? I think it's time to go, so... Sam, stop it. Thank you. Come on, shackle buddy. Nice to meet you.

You have to stay next to me. [doorbell jingles] Rusty, help! Rusty! I can't believe you want me to interview that guy. Come on Sam, it's just an interview. You're a reporter. It's your job to be objective, and this is the perfect opportunity to get the opposing perspective. There you be. - Thanks Rusty. - Thank you Rusty. [laughs] All right, now we need a fix. You better be paying in cash. The regular? - Always. - Always. Coming up. [giggles] I really like that name. Landon. Please. You with the flatlander. I can't. Oh, flatlander? Whatever. At least he's a flatlander and not from New Hampshire. Ugh, agreed. [shudders] New Hampshire. Two maple creamy. I got it. No, I got it. No, you paid last time. Don't let her pay. My bills are bigger. She just paid? They're dripping. [laughs] Hmm, yum. This is the best. Rusty always has the best creamies of all time. Mm-hmm. Do you remember when we were kids and it used to snow six feet by Christmas? Yes. We used to jump off the roof into giant piles of snow wearing purple snowsuits and knitted mittens I think. We need another winter like those. These warm spells are killing us. I know. 50 gallons less than last year is rough. Yeah. Dad and I have enough to worry about without Peterson Maple moving in on our industry. Tell me about it. They are the worst. Oof. How's your OP ED coming? Hmm. It's pretty challenging. You are Vermont's Erin Brockovich, the voice of the people. [laughs] So have you decided which magazine you're going to submit to yet? I mean the dream is the Vermont Times. Honestly, I'm a little nervous to be taking on such a huge topic for my first OP ED. But I really want to do something that matters, you know? Maybe it'll even lead to a real writing job? I would love to stop freelancing, stop that stupid notary gig. Have an office with a desk. Be a real person. A real writer. A real writer. Ah, there's my girls. Oh Dad, don't get up. Hi Mr. Burr. Hmm. Okay, farm stand's all set and I'll be back tomorrow to do the receipts and I'll get you some groceries on the way. Sneak some peace pops into the bag. [whispers] Only if I can have one. Deal. You know I can hear you, right? [giggles] - Love you Dad. - Love you. I'll see you later. - Bye Mr. Burr. - Sam. No peace pops in between. Oh, come on. ♪ [typing] Hmm. Tea is cold. Time for bed. Mine is empty and I just finished my paragraph. Thanks love. Perfect timing. Mm-hmm. ♪ Love you, goodnight. Love you. Night. Don't forget we're interviewing Landon tomorrow. [birds chirping] [doorbell jingles] What can I get you ladies? You seem like cappuccino girls. Oh sure. You know what? We're actually good. Thank you. [chuckles] Okay. Sam. Don't be rude. Free drinks. Nothing's free. Wow. That's so pretty. Oh, yeah. Rusty's the best at creating... Okay, so just jumping right into the interview, here's our first question. Uh, why are you on a mission to destroy the Vermont maple industry? [laughs] Wow, you get right in there, don't you? Thanks for starting with an easy one. [laughs] Oh. All right. I don't see us as destroying the maple industry at all. I see us enhancing it. How do you figure that? Well maple is not a flavor all over the world. The way Vermonters manufacture maple is traditional but it's expensive. If we want to give maple a global presence, then we have to use new technologies to keep costs down. We plan to create an unprecedented demand for syrup. Then the family farms will have more sales than they know what to do with. But how are people going to know the difference? You're falsely advertising that your syrup is made the Vermont way. If you want to do something like that then we need to come up with some sort of labeling system that allows people to see if their syrup was made by a farmer or a factory. It's a valid point and I'm sure something our company would consider. Really? Yes. We want to work with Vermont, not against. [laughs] You guys are feisty. [notification alert] [sighs] I have to go notarize a cattle sale. So um, interview's over. Oh. I can do the interview. No, that's okay. It's over. We really got what we needed. No, I got it. It's fine. Bye Sam. [clears throat awkwardly] So you say you want to work with Vermont, not against us. So does that mean you're not going to be buying family farms? Because I have a sugar farm that's been in my family for four generations and I want to make sure it's protected. The intention of Peterson Maple is not to buy up family farms. So yes, I promise your farm will be safe. Now. My turn to ask a question. Do you like sailing? ["Life Is Rosy" by Tim Myers, Jessica Penner] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Honey, I'm home. Hey. Best interview ever. Longest interview ever. I... I texted you like a million times. Oh sorry, spotty service. Mm, it smells like split pea soup in here. Oh yeah, it was delicious. Um, so. You spent the whole day with him. He's really great Sam. And I told him more about your labeling idea and he was really open to it. Please. I mean, I kind of doubt that. I don't know, I don't really trust his flashy watch or really anyone who pays with a $100 bill. I mean... I don't even know why you like this guy. I mean he, he doesn't even seem like your type. I don't know. There's just something about him. Don't be so judgmental Sam, we should welcome him into the community like good Vermonters. Okay, Little Miss Welcome Mat. I'm just a little careful about what kind of foxes I invite into the henhouse. Okay. I will be careful. But I think this could be a great opportunity for him to work with us and, you know, his company, and maybe everybody could be happy. He's not a Vermonter! Period! Whew. I'm really tired. I'm going to go to bed. Love you. [sharply] Okay, that's fine. Yeah, me too. Love you. Goodnight. You know, I had so much fun sailing with you the other day. You are a natural. I had a great time too. But for a second date I thought I'd bring us onto dry land. [laughs] So what looks good? Should we start with oysters? Ooh, I love oysters. You know, I never get to have them 'cause Sam hates them and we usually share everything. Right. Great, well since Sam isn't here, oysters it is. You know, Sam actually had a good question. Mm-hmm. Why are you making Vermont maple syrup? You know, I think Peterson Maple offered me a leadership opportunity that I couldn't pass up. Right? I was really excited about helping to build a business from the ground up. It's the whole reason I went to business school. You take a concept and you bring it out to the world, and it's challenging, and it's invigorating... Oh, I'm boring you. No, not at all. I, I think it's great that you're so passionate about what you do. I mean, you move to a place where you don't even know anybody? I've hardly ever even been out of Vermont. Well I think it's very brave that you went on a second date with a flatlander. [laughs] Right? I'm catching on. Okay, so now I get to ask a question. What's the deal with you and Sam? Because you have already mentioned her four times this evening. I mean it seems like you guys are kind of close. Well yeah, I mean she's practically like a sister to me. We've been inseparable since we were little. And she's always looked out for me. You know, been my protector. Ah. She's like the yin to my yang. Hmm. So if I wanted to do something spontaneous, would you have to ask Sam first? It depends on what it is. No. I don't think we need to ask permission for that. Cheers.

Sam: We were 12 years old and at the annual Sugar on Snow Party, there was this really mean boy there that Jess really liked, but he was talking to this other girl and Jess got totally emotional. Oh, my gosh. You know how she is. Jess, this is not right. Sam: Anyway, I was trying to make her feel better and I came up with this crazy idea. I'll never get married unless you get married. Let's make a pact. [spits] Gross, Sam. You're such a hippy. Both of our husbands are going to wear Carhartt pants, chop wood, and at least listen to Brad Paisley. - You're my best friend. - You're my best friend. Oh, let's make it official!

It doesn't matter if Landon doesn't get our pact, okay? We do. We agreed, Jess, to never break promises to each other.
