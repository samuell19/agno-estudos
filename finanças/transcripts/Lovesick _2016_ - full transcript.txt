Let's get some light in here Boo Radley I don't think I can do this. This is your idea Dash, I have no desire to hang out with your ex-girlfriend, but for some reason you do. It's fucked. Let's go. Mary and Conrad are waiting. C'mon. Get up. Into the shower, I'll find you something to wear. Not this. Hey Poop. Oh hey Snoop. I wasn't sure where to put it. Mark's not wild about it, but I love it.

Yeah, where's Mary? She left. Really?! She's not one for mustache rides. We can leave whenever you want to. Why didn't you say just something? Well you were too busy getting lipstick put on you face.

You have to eat man. Here. Here, have my soup Ok, just the warm water, will be good. Thank you. I don't want your soup Dash... you look horrible. You need to start taking care of yourself. When was the last time you had any exercise or had any fun? I can't even listen to fucking music anymore, she's in every song. Well then you're gonna have to start listening to new music!>> Yeah, like rap. It's all about getting laid brother. That's exactly what you need right now. Uhhh, I think that's terrible advice. Ok... Exercise. I'm finding her hair everywhere. Oop, oh no, that's one of yours Bee. What do you think Mary? I think you need professional help. You look like you're about to bomb a government building. She's right. She is right. Or ski a government building. - Mmmm.... What the... What the fuck is that? Hawk, Michael? Mike? Michael? Mike Hawk? You seem busy. Lotsa sick kids. Ok, is this serious? Is this serious? Look. It depends on how old she was. Don't screw around Stuart, I've been hacking for days. You probably have a cold. They're common. No-no-no, there's something seriously wrong with me. I've had colds before and this is different. Because I feel it, here, and here, and all the way down in my lungs. Aite. Look up. Kay. Aaaa... Aaaaa. You're so rough! Your glands aren't swollen. Well could it be Mono? STUART: I doubt it. Well then what is it!? A bruise. Broken blood vessel. Could it be Lupus? You can die from Lupus. Hmmm... Mmm... AH! What the fuck!? Ehh, it's not Lupus. Oh that's funny. That's really funny. Did they teach you that in medical school in your first year? Third. Fuck... Look, I'm gonna be really straight with you Dash. I think you have all sorts of problems that are beyond my expertise. What does that mean? I think you're clinically depressed. And it's... nothing to panic about, Depression is very treatable. I can make you a referral to a psychiatrist. Isn't that a bit extreme!? No. INTERCOM: Dr. Irving, report to the psychiatry ward. INTERCOM: Dr. Irving, report to the psychiatry ward. Dr. Irving, report to the psychiatry ward. Dash. Dash? Is there a Dash here? You working the night shift? Sure am. I saw you the other day. On Osborne, by Music Trader. And I'm Nora by the way. I'm Dash by the way. We have the same last name. No we don't, mines.... By the way? Duh. By the way. Nice one. I'm gonna use that. You should double me to Corydon. Uh, I don't think that's a great idea. Don't be a square. It's good Karma. Ummm... Ok Sure, why not. I'll double you. Wonderful. You're very sweet. How long've you been an alcoholic? I'm not really, not in the traditional sense. I'm a binge drinker, sometimes I black out when I drink too much. Ah.. I can not remember a few of those nights myself. >> My mother's an alcoholic, and... I guess this is just me trying to be proactive. Oh, does she get blackouts too? I don't know, I never asked... Not bad for your first time. Oh it's not my first time. Oh! Shit! OOOH! AA! - Nora, are you OK? What? AH! I don't know. Are you alright? NORA: Fuck. - Wait, show me. Oh fuck... Oh fuck. Ok. Um. I... Here, put-try this, I don't have anything but rolling paper. Ok... Oh dear. You want more? That's not an MP3 player. I thought some music might be nice, but I guess not. Could you put that down please? Of-course. Because you are the only person in Winnipeg with a record player. Umm. So the new stuff is on the right, and then the rest of them are ordered alphabetically by genre. If you could... be respectful of that.... Ok. I... am not into weird stuff. It's for your head. I uh... I don't own any ice. So. Very original. Thank you. You're an artist. A painter. You're very lucky. I plan to eat this later. Uh, Hey.. Woah, I don't remember agreeing to that. I'm not sure you have a choice. Wooahhhaahhh... Not cool. I texted a buncha people, so if you are planning to murder me and stuff my body parts into little paint cans, you will be caught. That's funny because, I seem to recall, you approached me. Trrrue. That was a terrible joke, clearly I need to ice more. To be fair, I did almost kill you. Also true. I can tell you want to hold my hand. So that's the vibe I've giving off? A hand holding vibe? Shit! Because I was gonna-I was going for more like a, a this, and then like a big yawn, and into that. Is... something wrong? No. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry if I'm giving you mixed signals. Oh I should probably go. I don't usually end up in stranger's apartments- like this is weird. I-... I'm a dummy. Sorry. Thank you for being so nice to me. I am really glad that we met Dash. And I hope you figure it out all out. Hey! I brought you a coffee. I'll stay late, you can leave early. Whatever it takes. We need to be done, today. Yep. Not tomorrow, not next week. Today! That's the deal we made. I'm starting right now. Why?-Because I'm a man of my word. That's why. I agreed to do this months ago; why do you care so much? Because I care about you and I don't like her taking advantage of you. We're friends, friends do each other favours, what's the big deal? Is she paying you? Of course she's paying me; I'm not a fucking idiot. No one said you were. Regular rate? Wel-... Dash... You need the money, and Lauren and Mark can certainly affordyour regular rates. It's fine, Alright. It's gonna take me two hours. I really don't understand what is bothering you so much about this. I have my reasons, but whatever, you gotta do what you gotta do. Bee, Am I missing something here? Because you seem really upset and I don't get it. We need a break. What does that mean? I need a break. From us working together I think it will be good for us. I'm gonna do the West Broadway mural on my own, and, then I don't know Breaks can be good. Yeah, totally breaks can be good. I'm gonna go, see ya later. I'm gonna go, see ya later. Hello? Dash are you still here? Hey Snoop. Oh my god, this looks amazing! Nice work! Well, I am a professional. Thank you for doing this. Mark and I have like zero spare time. I should write you a check before I forget, my brain has been so fried lately. I think I'm coming down with something How much do I owe you? You don't have to pay me. Don't be crazy, you need the money. Why don't you keep your old-lady chequebook, in your purse. Shut up. Seriously, we're good. Thanks Poop. You're always so good to me. Am I though? You wouldn't dare. MmMm... Mmmm... Mhmmm... Mmp... MMMmm... MhmmhmmhmmmmMm... Hmm! Mmmm! MMMMm Ooh! What the hell's going on here? Oh, hey baby, Hi. We're just um... Hm? It's this ridiculous game we used playRidiculous game... Yeah? You look pretty Wha-eh-What's the game? Is you guys, do you guys spit water on each other? Is that the game? Yeah. Ohh! It's really childish. Yeah, MARK: Well let me play, I wanna play - No- - Na c'mon, let me play, no I want to-I want to spit water. Please, please let me spit water. MmmMM! Mmmmm MMMmm MMmmm Mmmm... MARK! Oh my god. What? Dash, are you ok? I'll get you a towel. Of course he's ok, it's just water. That was, that was the game right, bud? Oh yeah man, that's it. You know'er. You are so fucking ugly and stupid that I bet your mother regrets ever letting your father stick it inside of her. >> Hey come on now, there's no reason we can't be nice to each other, Well we can't get along That's fair I don't like you, you don't like me- Yeah, I don't like youbecause you're a fucking unlikeable prick. Well, I don't like you because uh, you look like what I image Hepatitis cells look like. So. That's fair yeah. And it's, yeah- Dash, I'm sorry, Mark didn't mean to. Naaa. Actually, no don't put, don't I did-Mark did mean to, because Mark was told that's what the game was. I-but you- - Spit water. - Didn't-really- Anyway, you should see the bedroom, it looks incredible. - Yeah? Dash did an amazing job. Well, lets not go crazy here, it's just a new coat of paint, right? This is very true. Well, you didn't do it, so... - be grateful. I didn't do it, you did it, I am grateful, We, we are grateful. Uhhh. Very much so, no, because now, tonight, we get to make love under a fresh coat of paint. Mark... No, seriously, thank you Dash. Yes. I should go. I'll just come back tomorrow and finish? MARK: Actually, I don't think you have to. I think it might be kind of a fun thing for us to, for us to finish up. Ok... Yeah, let's-we'll- we'll-finish up, I think you just, you just get home, and get some rest and... Yeah, just be good to yourself buddy. Hmm! Hi, u-u-uh I'm not sure if you can help me or not but I'm looking for, a uh councilor or maybe a therapist. Nope, no I'm not suicidal. Uhh... Nope, none of that either. Just hoping to find someone to... talk to... It's what was below the surface, that sank the Titanic. So... How does this work? You talk. I listen. So why do you think you're here? I guess I don't, like how my life is going. It's not how I thought it would be. How did you think it would be? I don't know Different? There was this long table. Like the last supper, and Lauren was sitting right at the centre of it. Where I guess Christ would have been. And, I'm way down at one end of it, where I guess Judas would have been sitting, and Lauren, she's talking to everybody except me. Because I'm, too far away, and I try to talk to her, but she can't hear me. The unconscious mind is a cruel son of a bitch. Please continue. I, I don't even remember anything else; I-uh.... woke up. Couldn't go back to sleep. Well that was a dream, created by your unconscious. Now, what would happen if this dream were true? You mean, if Lauren was J.C. and I was Judas? Well, I wouldn't of sold her down the river for a couple pieces of silver. Ok, those are just symbols, trying to tell you something. Do you think it's a good idea to have dinner with your ex-girlfriend? Yeah. What... Are you saying that I should never see Lauren again? I don't give advice Dash, I'm here to listen. AHHHHHH! SNOOP! It's me! It's me! Calm down. Wha-You scared the shit outta me! - What are you doing here? I-It's not as weird as it looks. Your door was unlocked. NOPE! Waiting in someones car is pretty creepy. Ok, sorry. Hoooo god. So you're really doing it huh? I'm sorry Dash, this must be hard on you. It's all happening so fast, I know, it's crazy. I've never understood long engagements, and I can get my green card faster once we're married. Green card? Ohh... We're talking about moving to New York. Wow, New York. Big apple. I would totally understand if you didn't come. No-no, I want to come. Well, it would mean a lot to me. Don't uh! I was really angry. That's ok, I'd feel the same way. I've known you since you were twelve years old. I have to be at your wedding. I'll bring a date. I have to go home, I uh. Far too much drama for a Tuesday night; do you want a ride? Yeah, thanks-No! I have my bike. Find a date. I'll see ya later. Not if I see you first. Ah! Dash. Hey. Nice to see you, how've you been? I've been better. We have all been better. Do you play? Not well. Yeah, be either. Ow! Awww. Ok, I don't feel threatened, I'll play. I'm really worried about Lauren. I think maybe I should call her. Right... You don't give advice. If you want to call her. Call her. You got her number. Sorry, w-what is that? Is that reverse psychology? Nope, it's about taking action. Hey, I don't want to be like this. How about some truth Dash? What really happened between you and Lauren? I mean, I... I dunno, I wasn't ready... To settle down, get married, have kids... All that shit. I... I was 32, and thought I needed some space, I fucked up. But I mean now, I'd try marriage, why not? I mean Lauren and I were together for ten years right? So. She's barely known Mark Adam Jones for one year. I... What the hell am I supposed to do. WHY WON'T YOU GIVE ME ANY ADVICE!? Aw... Fuck this. You know what. I-I'm done Freud. Find some other... iceberg to chip at. Fuck. Hey. Thanks. Yeah. What the hell do you do in here all day man? I'm starting to worry about you. I'm fine. Well you don't look fine. Smells a bit sour in here, have you been touching yourself again? Yeah, that's definitely cum I'm smelling. Alright, I get it. I need to clean. I know that. You're not going to be able to have kids if you pump it too much. Once a week with an icy cool cream. It's all about the big release. There's something wrong with you. Definitely. So how is therapy going? Terrible, I think my expectations were too high. I don't know I've never found a good therapist myself. I actually don't think they exist. I mean think about it, if you're really good, you wouldn't have any patients. Hm? Good call man, brilliant. Exactly. Which reminds me. What is that? A form of therapy, I built it with my students. Are you familiar with the Rightman experiment? No. Good. You just slip your little finger into that ring, and uh... attach the wires to a live battery. To a-yeah, that sounds really safe. Hey, when you're a fat man in a skinny world, you'll try just about anything. You're not fat. No, not on the outside. So every time you think about Lauren, you just press that little red button, and shock yourself. Easy-peasy MMmm. You know, I think I'm gonna stick with therapy for the time being. But this is great, it's nice to have a backup plan. >> Suit yourself. Appreciate that. You teach at M.I.T. right? That's the calibre of work I'm looking at here? That is directly from M.I.T.. I appreciate your concern... Conrad. Hi, I'm Dash. And I smoke a lot of pot. And cigarettes. Both. I had my first drink when I was thirteen. Huh! - Me and Sam Ryan. He sounds like trouble. She was. She! Samantha. We were best friends since grade 3. We were inseparable. Sam Ryan. Well clearly you did not learn the first rule which is that you cannot trust people with two first names, especially if one of those names is one of ambiguous unisex names like "Sam". I wish I would have known this You're a fool! Sam got me into so much trouble. Yep. More-like-you-got-her into-trou-ble. Sorry. It was an all girls catholic school; there wasn't anything else to do. Ohhh... Blood of Christ. I hear you. More like peach schnapps and a hairspray bottle. Excuse me. Wow, you are so good looking. Instead of "bless you"? No? Not a Seinfeld fan? Oh! I mean, I know, I've seen a couple episodes. 'Cuz it's... That's the joke. I got it. Ok... Hello? Nora Van Denbrok, Hi. Hey, it's Dash. Mmmp! It's like I watched that happen in slo-mo. Fuck. You want some? Yeah, I do. Oh yours is better. That's usually how it works. The one you didn't get always tastes better. Mmmp, So I have this uh, wedding that I have to go to next month. Would you have any interest in joining me? Free booze. Uhh-fuck. Food. Free food, five star catering I bet. I... 've already screwed this up, right? You definitely need to work on your delivery. I know that. I'd really like you to come. Ok. Yeah you won me over. I'll be your date. So this is the perfect place to play some ball. 'Cuz there's no jock hustlers hogging the court. Y'know? It's here. Do you know these people? Yeah, this is Dr. Goldberg's place, I'm just gonna grab him. Gimme one sec. Ok Doc get open! - Ho, Ho-Hoo - DASH: Take that layup! Oooh, he's just terrible. Oh yeah! She does not need your encouragement doctor. I do. She's quite good at this. You gotta start - I can't do that, I'm a doctor. Oo! - Ooop! - Foul! DASH: That's not how a foul works. Goldberg. Get open. Ok. Right there! Oh nice! Nice old man. - Who is this guy? You know what? You kids I think I've had enough. Uh, keep playing. It was a real pleasure to meet you Nora. Likewise. - Thanks Doc. - Yep. I never noticed you were left handed. You don't notice a lot of things. Ohoohoohoo. Ohho! - Tragic. >> You know what, I think I'm done. Are you ok? Probably not. I hurt easily. Seemed like a good idea at the time. It's not so bad. Check it. Oh shit! You dated a tiger? We were just fucking. I keep uh... I keep meaning to get it removed. It's just so expensive. You're still in love with her. You should not waste your time with me. Do you think you're the only person that's ever been in a relationship before? I was fucking engaged. You were? Yup. And it didn't work out. And then I threw up for 2 months, and then I got over it. Hey. Everythin' Ok? Caterer just canceled. Are you serious? What an asshole. I can't believe this. Hey look, it's all good we'll-we'll just figure something else out. >> Babe, the wedding's in three weeks. I-I know when our wedding is going to be. I'm just saying that's plenty of time. Maybe for Tim Horton. Uh-uh, anybody like butternut squash soup? Oh my god, baby. Thank you. I'm sorry, I'm just-I'm pissed, but it's not at you. I just didn't think was gonna be so hard. We shoulda just hired a wedding planner. No shit! I fucking said so. We should have. I know you- - a-yea-yep. I feel like every time I come here this fucking thing gets bigger. >> Would you like me to take it out and burn it? Ohhh! That's a good idea. Yes. Now we're talking. Ok, don't be an an ass. Well, clearly we know who ol'Dash's "muce" is. It's "muse". Yeah-That's - "muce". Ok. Y'know maybe-maybe we get him to do like uh, wedding portrait of us Hey tell you what, I'll-I'll go naked if you will. Ok, well that's cool, you have an idea for our wedding so, sure. I'll run it by him. I mean, he is coming, so might as well put him to work. He could use the money I assume. Yep. Alright. I'll see you... tonight. Babe, baby? Don't worry about it. Fuck How long've you been a smoker? Jesus Christ Dash. I'm sorry, I didn't wanna bother you at your office again. I got a really bad shock. I'm not even your fucking doctor. No you're my fucking cousin. Second. Blech, you smoke menthols? I need advice Stuart. Show me your hand. Oh this, that's nothin', that's just for show. No-no, I'm really confused. Lauren is getting married. There's there other girl Nora Van Denbrok, she's in A.A. But I can't stop thinking about Lauren. So Lauren is getting married, that's what this is all about. Yes. It's always about a girl. I shoulda known. To think I was actually concerned about your health. I'm sorry, I guess I should have told you. She's getting married on the twelfth... Ooo boy Yeah Well, guess you're gonna have to stop the wedding. What have you got to lose? Maybe she's happy? Mark's a decent guy? If it was my Alice, I'd stop the wedding. Your Alice is lucky lady. Too bad she married a shitty doctor. Well, don't tell her. She's gotta know. Thank you. Hey! Hello?! I can barely hear you. Where are you? Oh my god! I'm so glad you're here! I can't actually hear you. You wanna drink? Yes! Aw... OH MY GOD! Three more. More Blue Steel You're not in that picture. Oh my god. Lauren! Are you Ok?

So we're... you know, but, Lauren has no face. And her.... Vagina? Yep. Yep. It's... Deformed? Gooey? Sharp? Pointy? It's like uh... a venus fly trap fucked a crocodile. So anyway, we're... and I push harder, and shit starts coming out. But we don't stop, we keep going, and then shit's coming out from both ends. What is-What is that face? Is that like a thing? Is both ends a thing? No. Not at all. Uhm... It sounds like you're entering a forbidden place. Like your dreams are trying to protect and keep you from entering situations that are dangerous. Curious, did you ever have a sex dream like this when you were with Lauren? No, of course not. Well now we're getting somewhere. I'm still in love with her. Do you think she is in love with you? Look Dash... As soon as you can let go of the past, you will stop having crazy sex dreams. Your mind will be free Maybe... You'll be ready to take a chance on someone new. That sounds like advice. I'll be right back. Ok. Hey, I got these exact same earrings for Lauren, that's weird. Now that's strange too. Lauren has the same sewing machine as you. That's just weird. Really? 'Cuz it's a Singer. I don't think there are any other brands. I guess, yeah, I just meant, I guess I meant the colour I need to lie down. Uhhh... I guess I should go. If you want to.
