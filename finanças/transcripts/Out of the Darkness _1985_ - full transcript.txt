(eerie wind whooshing) (car engine whirring) - [Mrs. Neil] Won't be long. - Who's your mom ringing? - The estate agent. - Why? - We're late. - Hello, it's Mrs. Neil. I'm sorry, we got a bit lost. I hope we haven't kept you hanging about. - Not to worry. By the time I've locked up the office and driven over, we should both arrive at the cottage together. No problem. Bye. Got a bit lost. (car engine whirring) (eerie music) (gasping) - Your girl gave me the key. - But this property is not for sale. My client will be here any moment. You do see what I mean, it would be best if you left. Call to the office some time, I'm sure-- - Don't tell me you're sure you can find me something equally suitable? - Of course. - Your client knows what happened here, of course. You're gonna tell her? I think somebody should, don't you? (suspenseful music) - How do you do? I hoped you and your husband-- - I'm afraid he couldn't get away from the office. This is Mike. - Hello. - Penny. - Hello. - And then Tom. - Hello. - [Estate Agent] How do you do? - Hey, this is good. - It's old. Didn't think it was this big. - Hey, look at the stove! - [Mike] Look at the old kitchen! This is a big landing. - It's a bedroom, you divvy. I'm having this room. My room's better than yours. - [Mike] No it's not, mine hasn't got stairs in. I would hate that. Tom! Come look at my room! - [Penny] Forget it! - [Mike] Look, one room-- - We're staying at the guest house in the village. - [Mike] Well, I'm not sharing with you. - And what makes you think I want to share with you? - [Mrs. Neil] It's certainly gonna need some money spent on it. - We could DIY it ourselves. - And if we're only gonna use it for the odd weekend. - I want to live here all the time! - If you do decide to sell, I would-- - Sell it? - Sell it? What's wrong with it? - Do shut up, you two, just for a moment. - Well, I'll leave you to it. - I'll be in touch! When I am trying to have a conversation, I just wish you would not butt in! How many times have I told you? - Too many. - How are you gonna manage with only two bedrooms? - Mike's gonna sleep down here. In the old tin bath. - [Mike] Very funny. - Nice one, mom. I'm going in the garden. - [Mike] So am I! - What do you think of the cottage, Tom? - I knew what it would look like. - That's supposed to be tiredness, so they say. - I'm not tired. - I am. And I know that I've been here before feeling. You arrive somewhere strange, then your eyes are working faster than your tired old brain, and something inside you says, "I know this place," which, of course, you do. Your eyes have seen it a fraction of a second before your brain's told you you've seen it. - [Mike] Mom! - Do stop shouting. - Come out and look at the old barns. I've got great idea what to use the big one for. - [Penny] You creep, it was my idea! - Calm down, there's no rush. We're here for two whole days. (eerie wind whooshing) (bell dinging) (man's voice shouting) - [Woman's Voice] You boy! From Eyam! You killed 'em! You killed 'em all! (footsteps creaking) (eerie music) That boy! That boy is from Eyam! - [Boy's Voice] Don't leave me. Don't leave me! - Wait, whoa, Tom. I'm looking for your mother. - She's not my mother. - [Penny] Mom! Come and look at these pigeon holes! - Hi! My name's Julian Reid. I live up the other end of the village in a small house. I put together lots of interesting documents, pictures, antique objects, all to do with this area. It's open to the public, by appointment that is. - Somewhere for you children to go tomorrow. - In fact, I have twice as many exhibits as I have room for. - Why don't you go into the garden? Mr. Reid, thank you for letting us know about your collection. - Let me start again. I would like to talk about this place. - You're a decorator? (Julian laughing) - Wrong. I'd like to put in a first offer if you're thinking of selling the cottage. Once I've converted those barns, this would make an ideal museum. - The estate agent said it had a history. - [Julian] But obviously he didn't tell you it's special. - [Mrs. Neil] Special? In what way? - Well, he didn't tell you it's a plague cottage. That over the weekend, the plague killed of a family of four. - Well, that's interesting. We could go off to the churchyard, tomorrow, couldn't we? And look for their graves. - You'd be wasting your time. They're not buried there. - Oh, where then? - Out here in your garden. But a boy of 11 was staying here. He died all alone a few days later. - Where's the boy buried? - Somewhere in the hills. Nobody knows where. But I'm working on it. - You're both mad. Does he look like a crook? - The best crooks never do. - Well, he certainly doesn't want us in the cottage. - Lights out, now. - [Penny] Oh, five minutes and we'll sleep. - No arguments, protests, or whining, making noises. I want you fresh for the morning. - [Mike] Oh, is that early? - We'll find something interesting to do together. - [Mike] Like digging up the garden? (Mike laughing) - There are times, Michael Neil, when I could gladly. No, I won't say it. Goodnight you two. - [Tom] Goodnight. - [Mike] Goodnight, mom. - Mom, are you gonna sell the cottage to that man? - It's too soon to say. Fold this, please. Anyway, Mr. Nickles left it for us to enjoy, so he wouldn't want us to sell it, would he? - But if he's dead, how would he know? - Past. To bed. - [Penny] Do you think it's spooky? - Damp, certainly. In need of a few tins of paint, absolutely. - I've lost my torch. - Spooky, absolutely not. - Got it. - Into bed. - Supposing the people who died there have turned into ghosts. - And supposing you get into bed and go to sleep. - I'm serious, mom. - So am I. Look, the past is the past. The present is now. And soon, it'll be tomorrow. So go to sleep. - [Penny] Are you coming up soon? - When you're asleep. - [Penny] Leave it open mom, please. - [Mrs. Neil] Sweet dreams, boys. (eerie wind whooshing) (bell dinging) (loud eerie wind whooshing) - I didn't dream it! - If he was looking through the window, he'd only had to be 30 feet bell. - That bell, what sort was it? - Like goats have round the neck. - You should get one for yourself. - [Mike] The people shouting? - That was at the cottage. - How come we didn't hear them, then? - I heard that bell there. - You saw him? - No. But he must have been there. - I'm going to the cottage. Come over when you finish. - [Penny] Tom says it's haunted. - I'll let you know if I see anything. I'm scared. - [Penny] Mom, really. - Looks as if the weather is going to buck up. Wouldn't you say? I thought we'd go for a drive, and a nice long walk. - On the top of the road, at the back here, they got a good view of Eyam. - [Penny] What's Eyam? - Have you not heard of the heroes of Eyam, and the plague? Whatever do they teach them these days? Oh, it's all right Else, when you cleared away the plates, you can go up into the rooms. Don't mind Young Else, not speaking is just her way. - There's a pamphlet on the Eyam on the hall table, and you should see what's in Mr. Reid's house. He's the expert. - Yes, on all kinds of strange things. - Oh, give him a ring first. - That sounds a good idea. Doesn't it? Do you like museums, Tom? - He should be in one. Oh, I hate museums! What's the hurry, Tom? (doorbell buzzing) - [Mrs. Neil] We're here. - I'm sorry, I have to go out. Just after you rang, I got a call about a house, where the furniture-- - Is for sale. - They started moving around the room. I must investigate. You understand. - Of course. Another time, then. - Why can't we go inside? - He's got a date with a poltergeist. - Very funny. - That's exactly what he said. - Mom! - Okay then, don't believe your own mother. On with the next. Cottage first, or a walk in the hills? I say cottage, Tom? - Walk. - You two? - Cottage. - Go walk. - Terrific. Sometimes I think democracy and freedom are totally incompatible. - [Mike] What does that mean? - It means we're going for a walk. See the village to the right there? The right, Penny. That's Eyam. - [Penny] Can you still catch the plague? - [Mrs. Neil] Not here. - You've already got it. There's a red spot there, one there. - I wouldn't make any jokes about it down in Eyam if I were you. - [Mike] What's wrong with having a laugh? - There's nothing wrong with it. But we wouldn't have been laughing if we'd lived in those times. - And they didn't get red spots, they were black. That's why they called it The Black Death. And 260 of them died out of 350, leaving 91 survivors. - [Penny] Let's have a look. - That's right. Just a minute, young man. 260 from 350 leaves 90. You have one too many. (birds chirping) (birds squawking) (eerie wind whooshing) - Hoy! Hoy there! Out! Hurry, out! Out, out! Out! I'll kill him, plague boy! Out! Plague boy! Out, on, on! On! Out! On, on! On, on! On, on! (bell dinging) - Don't leave me. Don't leave me. - [Mike] Tom! - [Tom] Did you see that mist come down suddenly? And cover everything? All of Eyam. And then there was a crowd, and they all run past. And then there was lad. The lad I saw from the bedroom window. Then suddenly he vanished. - [Penny] Who vanished? - And if we've got to go back tomorrow, we won't found out anything. - What's there to find out? - Oh, nothing at all. - Don't get snarky with me. - Then don't ask a stupid question. - How could you see the mist, and we didn't? - What mist? - You think your mom would let us stay on? - What mist? - When I was back there. - I don't know what you're talking about. If there was a mist, then I missed it. - Will you shut up? Listen, me and Tom want to stay on. I'm going to ask mom if we can. Do you want to? - Why do you want to stay? - Do you want to or not? - No. - Great, that means me and him can't. Mom wants us all to go back together. - Anyway, she'll say no. - Wanna bet? - A bar of chocolate. - Big or small? - [Penny] Medium. - Absolutely out of the question. - But mom, we're sensible enough. - The subject is closed. - We're not staying. - Get lost. - You've lost your bet and you won't admit it. - Wanna bet? - Mrs. Barrow would enjoy looking after us. - Sometimes I wonder I've done to deserve a son like you. - And I feel the same way about you. - God, give me strength. Tom, wouldn't your parents mind? - Well, if you say it's okay, it's okay. - And I suppose the idea is that I come and collect you at the weekend. - Yes please. - What would you do with yourselves all day? - We'll think of something. - Well, we can't see much television, because they haven't got one. Worst luck. - That's absolutely right. That's almost enough to decide me. - Both of us keeping watch is crazy. When are we taking turns? - Well, we could. But you didn't see him on the hill, did you? - No, I didn't, but so what? - He must be invisible to you. - If he looks through that window, I'll see him, all right. (birds chirping) - Your mom's all right, isn't she? - Sometimes. This is a right waste of time. - Time is it? - It's 20 past one. (bell dinging) - I think he's come back. - If he has, he's changed into a cat. - Just because we can't see him, doesn't mean to say he's not there. - That's what old Elmsie said, about God. - [Tom] He could be hiding behind the tree. - [Mike] What's he waiting for, then? If he's there. - Who knows? - [Mike] Go and ask him. - Why not? - I was only joking. If mom finds out, she won't let us stay. You know that, don't you? (suspenseful music) - [Penny] Mom! I'm thirsty. - [Mrs. Neil] Oh, Penny. Really? (door cranking) - The door! (footsteps tapping) - [Mike] That's it, I'm going in. - Maybe he'll come later. - Look, if he comes much later he can have breakfast with us. (suspenseful music) - Here's a pound for you. - Oh, thanks. - And one for you. - Oh, thanks. - And a pound for you. - Mom gave me money. - I'm sure she did, but fair is fair. While you're with us, you're part of the family, see? - Thanks very much. - I've left some more money with Mrs. Barrow for emergencies, but you're not to worry her for it. She's got strict instructions from me not to be taken in by anything you say. - Why you looking at me? - I have no idea. I'm off. Nobody's changed their mind about staying? - What about the key to the cottage? - What about it? - Can we have it? - Who's going to be responsible for it, then? - Me! - Me! - I'm the oldest. - I knew there'd be arguments as usual. So to save any further problems, I'm giving this to tom to look after. - Oh, that is not fair! - Come on, you can't give it-- - Mrs Neil, Mrs Neil. For the journey, love. - That's really thoughtful, thank you. - Else! - And thank you for looking after the monsters, Mrs. Barrow. Just don't let them talk you into anything. Especially my son, the godfather here. - Mom! (Mrs. Barrow laughing) - And as for you. Take a glass of water with you when you go to bed tonight. I can't see you going down in the middle of the night all by your little self. - [Penny] I'm not little! - You are in the middle of the night, we all are. - See you at the weekend, Mrs. Barrow! - And they'll be all right, don't you worry! - I won't! - [Mike] See you, mom. - [Tom] See you. - [Penny] Bye! - [Tom] Thanks for letting us stay, Mrs. Neil. - You know, I'm really disappointed in you lot. - [Mike] Now what are we supposed to have done? - It's what you haven't done. I'm leaving you, and there's not a tear in sight. (children imitating sobbing) Bye! - See you! - Bye! - See you, Mrs. Neil! - See you! - [Mike] Bye, mom! - [Tom] Bye! - [Mike] Bye, mom! Now what? - I'll tell you what you're gonna do. - Oh no, you won't. - You're going to the village shop to buy my chocolate. - You lost your bet. - I'll buy it when we get home. - [Julian] Hello? - Mom gave you money, so pay up. (truck horn hooting) - Sorry about yesterday. I mean, if you and your mother want to come over. - [Mike] You just missed her. - [Penny] She'll be back at the weekend. - I'm off to look over the Mountain Rescue Post, make my regular check in the equipment. Do you want to come along? - Yeah! - Well, you better go and ask Mrs. Barrow. - Okay! - Do you know Derbyshire? - [Mike] Not very well. - [Tom] No. - It's like no other place I know. Drive through green hills full of sheep. Right on the next corner, you see countrysides so desolate you think you're on the moon. It's full of contrast. (uplifting music) Take some. These are called green marker sticks. You're in trouble, all you do is this. Just hold it up. Bit of a snap, bit of a shake. And look. - [Tom] Hey! - [Mike] Hey, it's really good! - You'd be surprised how much light it could buy on a dark night. (uplifting music) - [Tom] Can we go up there? - [Julian] Well with ropes, equipment, and a lot of experience, you can. - [Tom] Scary. - [Mike] That's stupid. - No, no, scary is right. The whole place is brimming over with superstition, tales of the devil. A ram, 10 yards high. Teeth, blood red to end from end. All sorts of gruesome tales. There was a famous murder a couple century's back, right here at Winnats Pass. A young couple were killed by five men who were never caught. But they all died strange and horrible deaths. The last one to die confessed on his death bed. Confession's good for the soul, but forgiveness, that's hard, especially for our village. - [Tom] Why? - 'Cause of what happened there. - What was that. - Oh, it's a bad, sad story. But ordinary good people who turned into savages. - In our village? - How? Why? - Through fear. - [Penny] Of what? - Of probably fear itself. But who can know the real truth about the past? But let's not spoil a great afternoon. Ask Mr. Barrow to tell you about it, like he told me. (truck engine roaring) - [Garage Man] Pull her up, Julian. (birds squawking) - Plague boy! Out! Plague boy! On, on! - Oil change for you next time you're in. Come on, I'll see your back. Come on, straight back. Come on. All right, down you go. (truck engine roaring) (eerie air whooshing) (birds chirping) - Any more ideas? - No. - It can't be the same man. - We know that! - Who says it can't? - It can't! - [Tom] Why not? - Supper will be ready in an hour! - Great! - Well, I'm not staying out here. (suspenseful music) (lock clanking) It's really stupid, you having the keys. - It's your fault for arguing. - I've got as much right to it as you. - Take it! - Oh no. If anyone's gonna lose it, I want it to be you. - Oh, so you want me to have it, and you don't want me to have it, and you think I'm stupid? - Grow up! - Grow up yourself! - Sorry we stayed? - Sorry she has. - She's not so bad. It's good, that. - Yeah. (eerie wind whooshing) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - Tom, help me, help me. - Get off. - No silent scream from the walls today, then. - Maybe I can only hear them when I'm on me own. - I can take a hint, you know. (Tom groaning) (door creaking) - You should see your faces. - [Mike] Got over our little moody, have we? - With them being buried in the garden, I wouldn't have thought they'd be in coffins. - [Tom] Coffins? - They carried them out the front door. - [Mike] When? - In this dream I had. - When? - Just now. And when it ended, this mist came over and covered me. - You weren't up there long enough to have slept. - [Penny] Well your watch must have stopped then, mustn't it? - And what if it wasn't a dream? - [Penny] What's that supposed to mean? - On that hill, the boy was in the mist. - What are you two on about? - I don't have to be the only one to see things. Maybe now you've started to. - Great, now it's two against one. - Do you know, sometimes you can be so pointless. I'm going back to the guesthouse. Coming, Tom? - Coming, Tom? He's my friend, not yours. - [Penny] Tom, don't forget to lock up! - Should we go? I'm hungry. - Anyone want any more? - Oh, not for me, thanks. - That was one of your best, love. - That was nice, thank you. - [Penny] Really enjoyed that. - Lovely. - Were you born in the village? - Certainly not. - You make it sound as if you are glad. Is that because of what happened here? Mr. Reid said you'd tell us about it. - Black Friday, that's what it became known as. - Every man and woman were equally guilty for what they did to him. - Who? - The boy from Eyam. How old are you? - 11 and a bit. - So was he. And no one stood up for him. - There was one, so the story goes, that tried to stop them. But one against all the rest, they were hopeless. - You could argue, it all started in Eyam. You see, they're the other's family. And like all the other families, they had agreed to stay in the village, knowing they'd die. And yet, if there was a way of saving their youngest, then why not take it? - If we'd been his mother and father, we would have done the same. - What was that? - Try and smuggle him out. - Eyam people were being bedded every week. Not in church I'd mind, but in lonely places. In their own gardens, to try and stop the spread of the plague. Well, this family pretended their boy were dead, that he'd died from the plague. Then they had to pretend to bury him. Well, burying something in the garden wrapped in a sheet, that were easy enough to fake. But the worst bit, when a time came for the boy to go. With so many people already dead in Eyam, the lad must have known that he'd never see any of his family alive again. (somber music) There were guards all round the borders of the village, but the boy did get out of Eyam. And he made his way over the hill to this village, to a family that lived in your cottage. - Our cottage? - Aye, hat's right. But three days after he arrived, the whole family died, probably from the plague. The boy was all right, but now he was on his own. Then a woman saw him, recognized him. She knew he was from Eyam, and she must have shouted it out, for the whole village turned on him, blaming him for the death of the family. They ran him out into the hills. Some nights later, he crept back, probably for some food. He was seen. So they handed him over to the blacksmith. (metal clanking) They put a bell round his neck, like an animal, so he could be heard if he came back. Well, he did come back, and they killed him. After that, a lot of families moved out for a time. They couldn't face the shame. Most came back, but it's never been lived down. You take today, I suppose there's only a handful of people living here now that will admit to being related to anyone from that time. - But it wasn't only the shame that made them clear out after what they did. Country people, being superstitious, they'd be terrified that the ghost of that child would come back one night, and take its revenge. And a lot of them still believe it. - Oh aye. Should get old Mr. Reid onto that stuff, and in five minutes you'll have goose-pimples the size of oranges. - [Penny] What's he say about them, then? - The goose-pimples or the oranges? - (laughing) Ghosts. - Well, children. Well, he believes we should all go out of our way to be nice to them. - Ha! Even if there were such things, which there aren't, I'd avoid them like the plague. (everyone laughing) - He even got me at it when we went up The Shadow Peak together. That's high above the village. We were looking for the boy's grave. Oh, it's a right desolate place is that. - Why does he think it's up there, and not in the field somewhere? - Because of the old saying, a cave is no grave for a boy so brave. - Cave. (bell dinging) (thunder rumbling) (bell dinging) - Mike! Hear it? Can't you hear it? - Hear what? - The bell! The bell! Listen. (bell dinging) - There's a bell ringing now, and you can hear it? - Can't you? - Go to sleep. (bell dinging) (eerie wind whooshing) (dramatic music) (fantastical music) - Mike, wake up! He's in the garden! Mike! (bell dinging) (gasping) So we've both seen him? - Where's Mike? - Asleep. I woke him, but he couldn't hear the bell. He really couldn't hear the bell. - Take a look. This bit of grass, so white. - And no ring. He must have picked it up. Do you think he's still here? Somewhere. - I want to go back. - In a minute. - I mean go back home. I'm going to phone them early to come and collect us. - We'll talk about it in the morning. - There's nothing to talk about. - We've got to look for the cave. - We don't have to look for anything. I wanna get away from this place, and I'm never coming back. - What about the cottage? - I hate it. - [Tom] Penny. (dramatic music) (phone clicking) - [Mike] What are you gonna tell her? I saw a ghost, I want to come home? - You don't wanna hear the truth. You were too scared even to get out of bed. - You didn't see anything. You just wanna show off in front of Tom. - Pretending you didn't hear the bell, but you dare to admit it in front of your friend. - Why didn't you go back with mom? Then we wouldn't be wasting time trying to get her to come fetch her precious little girl. - You know what you are, don't you? You're just jealous. - [Tom] Shut up you two! - Once a pig, always a pig. I'll try again in an hour. - Just 'cause she wants to go back, we'll all have to. She's a pain. - She's frightened. - Pretending to be. - So you think she and me made it all up? - When we stayed awake all night, did we see anything? Did we? - It wasn't all night. - We saw nothing, right? - You coming, Tom? - Yeah. Go on being dumb, it's your problem. - Where you going? - Mind you're own business! - Where are we going? - I don't know. - Where are you going? - Yes, I do. - Come in, come in. Two more make any difference. We've got a few visitors. - So you see, for the poor people in those days, life was very hard indeed. And when they were struck down with the plague, there was nothing they could do to stop it spreading. Why? Michelle? - Don't know, miss. - [Teacher] Pay attention everybody, look at me. - A bit cramped. - Where'd you get all this from. - Some I bought, get given things, swap with other collectors. - Now, can anyone tell me how the plague traveled from London to Eyam? - British Rail. (children laughing) - You know Mr. And Mrs. Barrow? Where we're staying? Well, they said that you like talking about ghosts. - Talking to them is much better. Don't move. I'll show you a ghost I'm dying to meet. - [Teacher] And he had ordered some cloth to be sailed from London. - And these drawings were made 100 years ago by a boy from the village called Matthew Belthide. His parents owned the shop. Who do you think that is? (doorbell buzzing) Mr. Barrow told you about the boy from Eyam. - [Tom] Yeah. - That's his ghost. - [Teacher] Pay attention, everybody. - We're not the only ones to have seen him. - He's got a bell round his neck. - What would you do if you saw a ghost? - Same as you, wet me knickers. - We've seen him. - You have? - Last night. - Miss, they've seen a ghost! - [Teacher] Come back over here, please, come on. - Wait, when did you first see him? - [Tom] Two nights ago. - I was gonna get you to show you this. - Who is it? - I heard the bell first. - It was less than 100 years ago that a famous scientist-- - He's got a ring as well. - [Teacher] Carried by a tiny parasite living inside fleas, which live on rats. - [Kids] Ew! - Instead of making noises. Pay attention please, I won't say it again! - There's no time to lose, he'll be gone after tonight. He's supposed to stay three nights. That's how long he was here when they dragged him to his death. So this is our last chance. Then we'd have to wait another 100 years. - 100 years? - Yeah, that's right. At last, he might show us where he's buried. Well, it's like being lost. As long as somebody knows where it is, then he can be at peace. Well, I don't expect you to agree with me on that. Anyway, it's lucky you saw him on that hill. That's where we'll start from. Now go get your anoraks, And get changed into some strong shoes. And bring some chocolate and biscuits, could be a long wait up there. And I'll meet you at the footpath sign at the other end of the village, okay? - You're not from this area, are you? - No, I'm from Scotland, but my ancestors were from this village. I don't know if they helped to kill the boy, or tried to stop it. That's why I came back, to found out. We need these up there. You're in front, Tom, and us a little further off, ready and waiting the moment you make contact. - How do you know it's the right place? - You mean, how does he know it's the right place? Oh, he knows. He's watching you. All the time. (eerie music) Even now. - [Mike] Going to get some sweets, over. - [Tom] Don't forget, over. - [Mike] Don't forget what? Over. - [Tom] Penny owes you a bar of chocolate, over. - [Penny] Trust you to remember. - [Mike] We'll share it. - [Tom] Agreed, over. - [Penny] Agreed, over. - [Tom] Over! (children laughing) - Everything's there, Mr. Riley. - [Mr. Riley] If you say so, Jenny. - Cheerio. - [Mr. Riley] Cheerio. - What would you like? - [Mike] I'll have one of those? - Do you have a smaller one? - Who's it for, you or him? - Him, but I'm paying for it. - They don't make a smaller one. - [Tom] How much for the apples, please? - 25. On your holidays? - Sort of. We came to look at our cottage. - Yours is 37. Yours is 41. I thought there were two children, not three. - There are, me and her. - We go to the same school. - Yours is 25 for the apples, and 15.40. (Jenny sighing) (fantastical music) You've not paid! - Why didn't you tell me you'd found it? - You'd gone back to bed. - Goodbye. - I reckon we should keep an eye on her. - Yeah. - Yeah. - She's in a hurry. - Yeah. Who's she gonna tell? - [Mike] Tell what? - About the ring. - Okay, I'll follow her. - I can. She's gone into the garage. Can you hear me? I'm at the garage. - I should have guessed that. - And he's closed it. - We're coming over. Over! - [Mike] Something's going on here. - Oh, but he have to work-- - Where are you rushing off to? - Just jogging. - Well, where's your sister? - Timing us, at the other end. - What? - [Mike] See you at supper. - Do you all like chicken? Oh, well I hope they do, 'cause that's what they're getting. (Mrs. Barrow groaning) Wish I could run like that. - [Butcher] Those were the days, Mrs. Barrow, right? - [Mrs. Barrow] I used to be able to, you know. I did! (laughing) - Here! Nothing's happened. They're still inside, over there. - [Mike] What's the point of being stuck in here? When they do come out, who knows when that'll be, what do we do then? What can we do? Nothing. - I'm going to take a look. - Don't be stupid! (eerie wind) - That boy! That boy is from Eyam! - He's been spotted! - I told him! (panting) (thunder rustling) - Better go. - They'll see us. - Not if we're careful. - This is Tom, I hope you can hear me. When I looked through that window, the blacksmith saw me, and the woman from the shop, she shouted at me. I had to get away from them. (rain dripping) - Tom, Tom, where are you? - I doubt he's got it switched on. - Probably not. It's stopped. - [Mr. Barrow] Hey? Hey! - Mike, Penny! Are you listening? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? - Do we go, or do we stay? - [Mike] Go. - [Penny] Stay! (car engine roaring) - This is Tom calling from the edge of some wood. Between you and me, I think I could be a bit lost. But I'll know more where I am when I can get out the other side. With any luck, I might be near enough to see the top of that hill. Anyone there? Over! The trees don't help. Range, 400 yards? - [Mike] Hello, Tom. Are you receiving me? Are you receiving me? Over. He's out of range. Tom, this is Mike, do you read me? Tom, this is Mike, come in if you read me, over. (eerie wind whooshing) (birds squawking) (eerie wind whooshing) - This is Tom! You've got to get here! Can you hear me? Is anyone there? Answer me! - Oh, you know what we've forgotten, don't you? We're supposed to meet Julian what's-his-name at the thingy. - Oh, no. - This is Tom, I'm in the middle of this wood! I can't see a way out! (eerie wind whooshing) (suspenseful music) Penny, Mike! I hope you can hear me. The mist has come back, and it seems to be clearing. I don't know where I am. I'm all on me own. No, I'm not. (eerie wind whooshing) - You boy! From Eyam! You killed 'em! You killed 'em all! (suspenseful music) - I heard a woman shouting, something about Eyam. - Must be someone's radio. - No. It sounds like a lot of people shouting. - I can't hear anything. (truck engine roaring) - Tom, this is Mike. We're in the wood, we're in the wood. Mike, this is Tom. I mean it's Mike, over. Hey! - Tom? Tom! Where are you! - Tom! (Penny shushing) - I can hear something. Sounds like the sea. - The sea is nowhere near. - It is people shouting. Listen. (eerie wind whooshing) - We've got to go back, else we're lose out way in this. - We can't. - We're going back now. - Tom's over there, on the other side. - The other side of what? - The other side of the mist. (eerie music) - Who knows where they are? It could take all night. - I rang air rescue, they're on standby. - We'll not be short of volunteers from the village. - It's happening at last! - Guess who's organizing sandwiches and hot drinks. - Your wife of course. - [Mr. Barrow] Jenny Belthide. - [Julian] Jenny Belthide? - [Mr. Barrow] Aye, it was her idea. She knocked on every door. She even roped in Young Else. - That means the final round has started. - Final round? Where's the fight? - In the village. Up there. (thunder rumbling) (crowd yelling) - [Man] Where's the plague boy? (crowd yelling) (fire crackling) (tense music) (crowd shouting) (crowd shouting) (tense music) (frightening music) - It's Tom. (crowd yelling) They've got Tom! - Get down! - [Mike] Who are they? (crowd yelling) (Tom panting) (frightening music) - Tom! - Up here! Tom! Tom! - He can't hear us! (frightening music) (fire whooshing) (water dripping) - With the amount of guard. Make sure you don't come back to the village. It'll be two of you, at a time! - I want one of you to come back with me now to fetch food for the men on guard! - Count on me, Janet! - What about food for the boy? We can't let him starve. - If you want him fed, then feed him yourself! - [Crowd] Right! - I will at that. (rocks crashing) - Tom! (eerie wind whooshing) (stick crackling) (uplifting music) - It's too far. - Do you think we should go higher? - Well, we'll cover logically, he'll go on the highland, wouldn't he? - All right. (dramatic music) - Julian! I know where he is. - We've got to dig him out. - We can't shift these rocks on our own. - We could try. - All those weird people will come back. - They won't. - They will! - Wanna bet? (helicopter whirring) - [Rescuer] Where is the other boy? - Trapped in there! - [Rescuer] Okay. We'll get you all down, safe and sound. Won't be long now. (metal clinking) (helicopter whirring) (rescuers yelling) - [Rescuer] Come on! Hold it! - Ah, good evening. You okay? - Yes! - Was he here? - This was his. Have it for the museum! - Thank you! Hold on! You know what you've done, don't you? - I'm sorry! - Don't be sorry! You helped the village get back its heart! So, where do we go from here? Next stop, the world? (uplifting music) (upbeat music)
