What the fuck? Yeah. - Good morning. - Good morning. You want me to make you breakfast? - Uh uh? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. No, breakfast. Ew. Yeah. Yes. Mmm. Why you looking at me like that? You didn't sleep again last night. Luc? Yeah? It's really fucking good. You like it? You want to tell me about it? You talk in your sleep. What did I say? I don't know, you were mumbling something. What's keeping you up? I don't know. I really can't remember, to be honest. Why do you keep shutting me out? I'm not, I'm just busy. Uh, don't lay that all on me. You got your own life, too. What's what suppose to mean? It means like everyone's got their own responsibilities. Right? Okay. So why are you so worried about mine? Jesus, Luc. You know, I only stayed in Ithaca to summer because I thought we were going to have something special. I didn't say we couldn't. So why is everything so difficult with you? You know, sometimes I feel like, it's like, you want me to disappoint you. Lucas, where are you going? Alicia? Alicia? Where's my brother at? I don't know where your brother is at. Fuck you mean, you don't know my brother is at? I don't know where your brother is at. You know where he's at when you want to get high, though, right? No, just chill, yo. Fuck you mean, chill? Ain't no chill, mind your business. Do me a favor, yo, stop touching me. - Yo, you dissing me. - Stop touching me. Keep touching me, you making me mad hot. I'm fucking him up and have my sister fuck you up. Yeah, I will fuck you up. Get the fuck up outta here, you bitch as nigga. Fuck outta here. You ain't gonna shit to nobody- - Fuck you, ain't nobody even talking to you. Shut up, that's why you walking off, you bitch ass nigga. What the hell was that? Nothing, don't worry about it. Fuck that, it's all good. He ain't gonna do nothing to nobody. You selling drugs? Is that what this is about? Damn. Bet you were waiting to say that, huh? Okay, well you're freaking me out right now. What, don't look at me like that. I'm just looking at you. So, you're gonna call me or? Yo! You forgot your bags. You got to be fucking joking. Lucas, now, what's wrong? Keeps taking my shit. Now, my laptop's missing. I don't know what to tell you, honey. Hot damn. I needed that for finals. Kenji was here yesterday. Are you serious? He ain't said anything about coming by here. Lucas. Now, you know how he is. Why didn't you message me and let me know he came by the house? Lucas, that's brother. He just got out. It's going to take him awhile to adjust. That has nothing to do with me. I can care less about any of that. Lucas, don't do anything stupid. Yo. What's good? Get the fuck out of here. Oh shit. Look who the fuck just fell off the back of a milk carton and shit. What up, nig? - What's good man? - Shit, man. What's good with you, man? Ain't shit, same ole shit. I heard them white folks got you downtown. Polishing shoes and shit, man. What's up with you, man? Nah man, it ain't even like that. Man, I'm out here doing my community service, though, man. You always got some funny shit to say, though. You know, them two for fives, they gonna go, man. You know what I mean, but what's up, though? What the fuck you been doing? You seen my brother up here, man? He might be up there with that broad and shit, man. I'd check, but... - All right, man. - Yeah. Yo! What the hell you knocking on my door like, for? Is he in here? It's too late for that. What you mean, it's too late, yo. Watch out man, I'mma talk to his ass. What you doing here, bro? You know why the fuck I'm here, man. Yeah, let me a bogey, Luc. I ain't got no bogey for you. Why the fuck did you take my laptop? Man, I ain't take a goddamn thing. Kenji. Yo, I know you was there, man. I know you was at mommy's house. The fuck you do that for, man? You know what, bro? You got it. I'll see you later. And as for you, you better find my shit 'cause you best believe, I'm coming back. I don't know what's going on between you two. It ain't got nothing to do with me. How you doing, Lucas? I'm all right. I need to ask for an extension on the final. There's a lot of family stuff going on and uh... I know going back to school hasn't been easy for you. But if you're going to turn this assignment in late, again, I'm going to need a note. A note? Yeah, like a note from a doctor. All right. Look, I want you to know something. That last assignment you turned in, was brilliant. You think so? Yeah, it was the best in the class. I'm not kidding. Listen. You give me that note, I'll give you two days. It's not enough time, man. I know it isn't. But I believe you can do it. Okay. Hey Lucas, wait up! What's this? It's a contact at the student health services. Maybe he can help you get that note. Cool, I'll get in touch. Thanks. Take care, Lucas. You, too. The library is closing in five minutes, five minutes. Sir, the libraries closing. You just said five minutes, one minute ago. Do you need help with anything? No, I don't need any help. Just a little extra time. Is that right? Mommy, is this way? Hmm hmm. Daddy, mommy's this way? Hmm hmm. Daddy, help us get Play-Doh. Daddy, help us get Play-Doh. Yucky. It's some on your pants? Yeah, there's some on my pants. It's okay. - Will you stay right here? - Yeah. I'm gonna get us some more napkins. Okay, don't move. Hurry dad, get some. Look at the butterfly! A butterfly. Dad, a butterfly. Yeah. It's like an orange. It was orange and black. Orange and black. A pretty one. It's some on my hand. - Lick it off, silly. - I did. Want some? - Is it good? - It's good. You dropped some. I'll just lick it, that's okay. Ah. Ice cream shop is over? Ice cream shop is over? No. - It's not done? - No, it's not close yet. It just opened. - Open. - Yeah. - It's five minutes. - Yeah. Mommy needs to get some? No, I don't think she wants any. I think I'm gonna say yes. You're going to say yes to her getting some? Okay, that's nice of you. Hi, bootie boo. How was your day, today? - Um, good. - Good? You wanna come to mommy? What'd you have for lunch? Chocolate chip, chocolate chip ice cream? Oh my gosh, you're such a lucky girl. She was good for me today. Yeah? You wanna watch Goldie and the Bears? - Yeah. - While mommy and daddy talk? - In your room. - In your room, okay. You're gonna watch Goldie and the Bear in your room. Lucas, I thought we agreed, no sugar? Lazifa, I only gave her a little, it's not gonna kill her. Still, you're creating bad eating habits for her. So, how's school? It's all right. You still talking to that girl? What's her name? You mean, Mariah? Whatever. Nah, I haven't talked to her in a minute. What's a minute? A little kiss, minute? Happy birthday, ma. Ah, thank you, sweetie. Ah, you know, I don't like being reminded how old I am. Shoot, who does? Where's Zanura? I thought she was coming with us. She wanted to go to the circus with Lazifa. Lazifa texted me this morning, wishing me happy birthday. I thought that was kind of sweet. It was. You know, Lazifa should come by a little more often. I can't remember when the last time I saw her. You know, it's one minute, we're up. One minute, we're down. That doesn't have a damn thing to do with me. I really like her, a lot. Maybe, you should call her. I'm sure, she's around. Why you always coming to the sales department? You ain't gonna find nothing over here. Just get what you want. With what money? Hmm, take it. I'm going to go check out these laptops. I'll be back, all right? Don't leave me here too long, Lucas. I won't. How's the pizza? It's all right. Not really hungry anymore. Did you get a chance to talk to Kenji? Yeah, I seen him. Same old shit with that dude. He's your brother, Lucas. What's that supposed to mean, ma? Did you ever stop to think about how he feels? You know, what he's going through? Ma, we've been here plenty of times. I'm done helping that dude. There's no such thing as helping anybody too much. You know, maybe that's the problem. Maybe we're helping 'em too much, you know? You ever think about that? Are you insinuating that I'm an enabler? Ah, I didn't say all that. Yeah, you're insinuating that I'm an enabler. Thank you for the day, Lucas. No problem, ma. I love you. Love you, too. Hmm, you want some broccoli? - No. - You want the juice? - Yeah. - Okay. You should try to eat some of that broccoli, though. There you go. Here. Here's your juice. Is it good? You should try some of the carrots. What are you doing? Writing. Can I write? You wanna write? Yeah. Okay. Here, you can write on this one. - This one? - Yeah. That's a pretty picture. Hey, can you write your name? Yeah. Look at you, you're silly. You forgot your shoes. You're silly. Got it, look at that. I see. Hello, you've received TC3's counseling and psychological services. My name is Ben, how can I help you? Uh yeah, I'm a student at TC3. I was wondering... Are you there, sir? Uh, I'mma have to call you back. Sir? Hey. What's up? You grab everything? Yeah, how's Zanura? She's good. She's napping right now. Is she? What you have for lunch? She had broccoli and crackers. Okay, good. She likes broccoli. Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm good. Why? I just left your bags in the closet. I thought you wanted to talk about? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? I don't know. Yeah, I want you to take your things. As if I love you, like, what about Zanura, she needs me, too. Like, you need me. Like, if it's about Mariah, like, I'm not talking to her anymore, I promise. I can't trust you. Look, I don't think you should sleep over anymore. I need my own space. And if you need to see Zanura, you can come by tomorrow. All right. Okay. Have you ever talked to anyone like me before? No, I can't say I have. I'm kind of being forced to come here. It's say here on your application that you're having problems studying. Yeah, it's kind kinda my thing. Hmm, so distractions at home or, elsewhere? Yeah, home life. I mean, that's part of it. It's my brother- - Your brother's distracting you? How old is your brother? He's 11 years older than me, still acting the same damn way we did as kids. I know the type. And what is it about your brother that's nagging you and preventing you from being productive? Stealing from me. It's like, first it was my winter jacket. He took my daughter's piggy bank, sold that. Now I'm without a computer. I'm pretty sure it's him. Is he stealing from the rest of your family? Just me, thinks I have a whole bunch of money or something. Have you set boundaries with him? Yeah. It's like you tell him to do one thing and he does the complete opposite. And my mom, she doesn't choose sides, but, I think she knows I'm right. Lucas, what do you really want right now? I just don't want to go back to my old ways. Drinking, fucking, wanting to fight people for talking shit. Now, I just want my daughter to go to a good college. Shit, I even want Lazifa to be happy. I mean, she deserves that. It's all good things to want. You wanna talk a little bit more about that? Is it going to get me a doctor's note? Because right now, I don't have too much time. I got to get going, soon. Lucas, do you think that you could tell your brother that you love him, but you know, you can't really hang if he's going to act out inappropriately? To be honest with you, man, the next time I see that nigga, I'm going to kill him. Chapter five and chapter four are what you generally, ideas that you brought in the reflection page, I think. Which was it, chapter five and chapter 10? - Chapter five and chapter 10. - Okay. So it's like a reference to a similar issue that you were trying to address. Which was it? Class is over. See you Mariah. And one thing that I would like to talk to you, is about your reflection that you send me. For me, it's not clear what you're trying to say... So what is this, like some weird mating ritual you do? Good evening to you, too. So you don't answer my texts, but you feel compelled to just pop up out of nowhere? Fuck, are you going to get a drink? Since when do you drink? I don't. It's one of those days. Yeah well, apple juice doesn't count. And don't rub it on your clothes. Just rub it on your hands, all right. You want some, Lazifa? Sure. I want to smell good. We're all gonna smell good, oh, oh. - Yes, indeed. - Ew. How do you smell, how you smelling, you smelling good? You gotta rub the backs, too, rub the backs. Yep, there you go. Back of your hands. Gotta get in between your fingers, too. Gotta put on some perfume, here. A little dab here. A little dab there. Some right down here. On your clothes, yeah, it's good. Smells good, let me smell. Let me smell. Oh, you smell delicious. Are you going to eat me? Well, not right, I think I'd rather eat this spaghetti. How about that? Are you gonna eat me? No, not without salt. Here, put some on. Let me see, turn around. Let me see your face. Turn around this way. She's perking up her lips. Just a little bit, okay? Do this, go. Yeah, I'm gonna rub that on just a little bit. Oh wow, wait a minute. Not done yet. Turn around here, let me see. Zanura, aren't you too young for lipstick? - No. - Say not today, mom. - Not today, mom. - How old are you today? - I'm three. - Three? Uh uh, here we go. See, you licking it off. You're not suppose to lick it off. What do you want to drink, Darlene? I'll have a glass of ice water if you don't mind. Okay, got it. Okay, come here. Let me see, let me fix it. Let me look, turn around. Oh, you look beautiful. I like it, I like it, I like it. Give me kisses. Are you a good cook? I'm a good cooker. You're a good cooker? - Okay. - That's enough salt. So, how long have you been cooking? Um, for 10 minutes. 10 minutes? This looks delicious. Thank you. I'm glad you invited me to dinner. Zanura was looking forward to having this pasta with you. Mommy, thank you for the spaghetti. You are very welcome, Zanura. Thanks for helping me. You're welcome. Wipe your face, Zanura. Good job. I know Lucas can be difficult sometimes, Lazifa. But I'd like it, if you two could work things out. You play pool? Do I hold a stick and try to hit balls on the table? Yeah, what you just said. Can't say I do. Mariah? Yeah. There's a lot you don't know about me. There's a lot I don't tell you because I didn't want to scare you off. Everyone's got baggage, Luc. It would be weird if you didn't. I feel like you hide stuff from me because you think I don't understand or resent me for not having the same upbringing as you. Are you kidding me? I'd trade places with you in the past, present and future. Don't say that. Nah, it's real stuff. What do you mean? My father was murdered when I was six years old. I never got to say goodbye to anybody. No friends, no family. Do you miss him? Fuck, I hate talking about this shit. You know, when he died, it was just like I was expecting Kenji to fill his shoes. Well, I bet he'd be proud of you now. Who knows? I'm sorry. It's hard. Reminds me of all the stuff I had to learn my own. Shit other kids took for granted. I can't keep doing this with you, Luc. Look, I'm sorry that happened. I really am. But you can't just say one thing and then expect everything between us to suddenly change. Like , why are we even trying to be something? I'm not normally around people like you. I mean, don't get me wrong. I wanna be. It's just... What? It's just, what? Me and Lazifa split. I mean, everything I'm telling you is the truth. You know? I'm not here to just hold your hand, when you're feeling down. Where you going? You need to figure your shit out. Wait. You got this, right? So why is that one your mom and this one is me? - Because, I made it for me. - Okay. I got one in my ear. Okay. Um, look at what I have. Hey. Wanna come in? - Thanks. - Hmm hmm. - Hi, daddy. - What's up! Are we playing a game? Are you playing a game with grandma? No, a real game. We can play a real game later. I wanna go, have, go, mama. You're here, early. Yeah, I was already in the area. I figured, I'd stop by. You want something to eat. Nah, I all right, thanks, though. You know, it wouldn't hurt for you to come to dinner, next time. I don't know, ma. Just don't think it would be a good idea. You know, I see things in you that others don't see. They just don't know you the way I do. You're my mom. You're supposed to say that. Is that what you think? Is there something I can help ya out with? No, I'm good. Thank you though. Your call has been forward to an automated system. Fuck! Hey. Hey. I got your message. I got you these. I tried to call you. I think you should keep those. Are you really going to go to Seattle? I don't think you should go, though. I mean it. I know me coming here like this, is weird. Do you still love me? I don't know. Do you still love your baby's mother? Look, I love her, but I'm not in love with her. - Hmm. - I want to be with you. Look, I got it, I got it! Look Mariah, like, I've messed up. What do you, what do you want me to say? Like, I don't want you to go to Seattle. What are you even going to do there? - Lay it on me. - No. I'm not even going to do that. You're unbelievable, you know that? My rides here. I don't want to miss my flight. So you're really gonna leave? I'll see you around, Lucas. Take care of yourself. Yo! What the fuck is it with you, man? Man, I wasn't even thinking. You know, shit just get crazy sometimes. But yo, I'm looking for it. I'mma get it back. Promise you that much, yo. Yeah, we good, man. I mean, you're going to do what you're going to do anyways, right? Bro, listen. I'm going to call your phone, as sure as I get it. Just pick up, all right? Yeah, all right. Ma! Ma? Don't jump on mommy's and daddy's bed. You jump on your own bed. What? Sister, take this in the bathroom. Okay, I'll take it in the bathroom. No, this! I can't carry the tub. Where we taking it? To the bathroom. Okay, is this the bathroom up here, right? - Yeah. - Okay. - And this. - Yeah, you- - No, I don't, I don't. - You tickle. - No, I didn't. Hey, Zanura. - I wanna play. - We'll come back. - You ready? - We'll come back. Mommy. Come to mama? I'm ready to go out there. You guys wanna get something to eat? No, no, no, no, no, again. - No thanks. - Stop. You wanna say bye, to daddy? No, I wanna still- - Say bye to daddy. - I wanna still play. If you need me to watch her this week, I can take some time off. I want to play. - I'll think about it, okay? - I wanna butterfly sicker. I want a butterfly sticker.
