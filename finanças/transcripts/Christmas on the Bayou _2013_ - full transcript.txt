- You ready to go? Where's your hat? - Do I gotta go to school? - Yes, you have to go to school, and I thought we agreed you would ask before using my computer, sir. - If I had my own, I wouldn't have to ask. - You know, the closer we get to Christmas, the less subtle you get, Zack. Where's your homework? Got it? - Yes. - How 'bout your cleats? - Maybe soccer will be canceled because all the snow. - Yeah, highly unlikely, considering you play indoors. - Are you really coming this time? - I cannot be the only mom that's ever missed a game before. - True, Billy's mom missed it last week. - Okay. - But his dad came instead. - All right, I will be at your game. I promise. We do okay, just you and me. We always have. Right? You seen mommy's phone? - Blue towel. - Yes. Okay. Chop-chop. We are late. - We're always late. - Good morning! - Hey. - Hi! Please tell me you got it. - I didn't get it. - What? Where did you look? - I went to four different stores. Everywhere is sold out. - Well, I mean, I know it's a popular gift this season, but somebody's gotta have it. - Every place I went to had the newest tablet on back-order since October. You can make a ritual sacrifice to the retail gods, and it still wouldn't arrive before new year's. That's what the sales clerk at the third store said. She was very firm. - All right. Please keep looking. Your target market is constantly on the go. I mean, this is a generation that DVR's through commercials, am I right? Most of them have never even picked up a newspaper before. You need to catch their eyes where you can grab them. But people don't speak face-to-face anymore, this is how they communicate. It is time to innovate, adapt. It's a whole new modality. This is your demographic. - Mom! - And we are the firm-- Hello Mom! - To help you reach them. - That's a little younger than we discussed, isn't it? - Can you see me? Mom? - Oh, I am, oh, oh, oh! I'm so sorry, this is my son, it's Zack. He was watching a movie-- - You want me to repeat that? - On my computer last night. - Yeah, might be time to get him one of his own. - Don't forget my game. You promised you would go. - I got my kids a new tablet for Hanukkah, and now I'm a hero. - I'm so sorry, I have to go. He's got this soccer game. I promised I would be there. You have kids, you, no, okay. You guys, please forgive me. I'll take over, she-- - I just completely forgot. - Every Wednesday, she has-- - Do you guys have everything you need, I mean-- - Yeah, go, go, go-- - That was the, just, you have it, okay. - Go go go, I'll take over. - Thank you so much. - Just go. - I just forgot. I'm so embarrassed. - No, it's-- - I'm sorry. I am so embarrassed. Boots. - I hate soccer! - No, you don't. - I hate it. I don't get to play, and Trex Peters called me a spaz. - Oh, honey, he lost all credibility when his parents named him Trex. I hate it! I have no friends, and I hate school. I don't wanna go. - Honey, it's third grade. You're not allowed to be miserable till at least high school. - You never listen to me! Hate soccer, I hate soccer! I hate soccer! - Pretty angry, huh, bud? Look, if you don't wanna play soccer, I'm not gonna force you to go back. - And then what about school? - Nice try. - Look, I do like soccer, but you never play with me. How am I gonna get better if I have no one to play with? - Hey, why don't we get excited about something, okay? We've got Christmas coming up. It's gonna be fun, I'm gonna get you a big tree. And some presents. We'll have a nice dinner. - Oh yeah, with who? - What do you mean, you and me. It's perfect, right? Hey. Yeah, of course everything's okay. How'd you like some company for Christmas? Josh, hey, hi, I'm, I wanted to apologize to you about yesterday. - It was a not a problem. I'm a man who values substance, not style. - Are you saying that I lack style? - Oh, definitely, but you compensate. - Okay, Josh-- - I can tell by the tone in your voice that something's up. What do you want, now are you quitting on me? - No! - I can never tell with you 'cause you always seem like you're looking for something better. - Well, uh-- - It's not a bad thing, just give it to me straight, what do you want? More money? - Sure. But I will settle for a holiday. I just gotta spend some more time with my kid. I have two weeks saved up. - You're gonna miss the holiday party. - I'm no fun at parties. - Fine, take your holiday. Go someplace amazing for Christmas. Relax, and work on the Turner account. - What was that last part? - Nothing, seriously, take as much time as you need. - Thank-- - Where you thinkin' of goin'? - St. Martinville, it's Louisiana. Right south of Baton Rouge on the bayou. - Gah, that sounds horrible. - It's home, and I think that's what Zack and I need right now. - Well, then, get outta here. And go get you some of that Southern love. - Thank you. - Oh, and on a completely unrelated note, Turner file's on your desk. Happy holidays. - It doesn't look very Christmas-y. There's no snow. - Look, I know it's not New York. But you can't knock a Southern Christmas. We even have our very own special Santa Claus. - Mom, I am seven years old now. I know for a fact there's no such thing as Santa Claus. - Sorry, baby, I just need a minute. - Has it been a minute yet? - Yes. Come on. Pretty cool? - Yeah. - Wait a minute, who are you? - Grandma, it's me, Zack. - No, I don't think so. You cannot possibly be my baby grandson. - But it's me! - Oh, well, whoever you are, you'll just have to do. - Oh, ma, come on, be careful. - Oh hi, honey. Come on, you guys, come on inside and get some decent Southern food in your belly. Let's go! We got so many wonderful things planned. You're gonna love it. I know! Hey, little darlin'. - Better watch out. Alligators love kids. For breakfix. My daddy said, when you hear a splash in the bayou, a gator ain't far behind. Who are you? - Zack. Who are you? - Sienna. I live here. You sound funny. - So do you. - Anyhoo, you goin' to the Christmas Eve bonfire? - I don't know. - Bonfire's where Pere Noel comes. - Who's Pere Noel? - Papa Noel. He comes every year. Santa Claus. - I don't believe in Santa Claus. - Suit yourself. - Why are you dressed like that? - I'm an angel. - Sienna Grace, your mama's lookin' for that tablecloth. - Gotta go. - Ah, there you are. I thought we could decorate the Christmas tree tonight. Zack? - No, grandma, level five. - What is that? - I don't know. I stopped asking. - Katty, I don't wanna be hanging tinsel on Christmas Eve. - I know, mom. We will do it, I promise. But, right now, it is bedtime, sir. Come on. - Level five, Mom! - Level five, I know. You got there once, I bet you can get there again. Can you say good night? - Good night. - Good night, sweetheart. - Good night, mama. - I'll get the door. Hi, Katty. - Hello, mama. - I just put Zack to bed. - Mommy, I'm 30 years old, you don't have to tuck me in. - I'm just so glad you came home. Honey, it's gonna be lovely. - I'm sorry it was so last-minute. - Oh, well, you know like I told you when you went away to college? Home is a place where they'll always take you in. - Now, why do you make it sound like we're destitute? Zack and I have a really nice life in New York. - Then why'd you come home? Good night, sweetheart. Good night. Christmas is gonna be lovely! - Good night. Wow, one thing I didn't miss about Louisiana was this heat. I don't know how you're workin' out here. - Mm, not that hot. You're getting soft, Katty. - Yeah, I know. What do you got there? Mint? - Lemon verbena. I sell it over at Mr. Greenhall's store. He says it does very well. - What do you charge for somethin' like that? - Oh, it doesn't matter. Every little bit helps. - Hey, mama, if you need money, all you have to do is say the word. - Oh, honey, no. That's very sweet of you. But I can take care of myself. I don't mind a little hard work. Oh. - That is one persistent little bugger. - All right. I know what you're gonna say. That I work too hard. - I did not say that. - You didn't have to. I can read you like a book, lady. - A good book, I hope. - Oh, I don't know. I can't get past the chapter on judging your daughter's life choices. - Well... First, there was that divorce. But even before that, there was all that work. You are so busy. And it affects the boy. - Oh, mom. - Don't even get me started on that big city, livin' all alone. You know, things would be so much better if you'd just-- - Mom, come on. - Sorry. I'm sorry. You know me, I just speak my mind. Oh, Katty? Would you mind getting those satchels on the shelf in there and take 'em to Mr. Greenhall's? - Hey. I love you. - I know that. - Okay. - Oh, Katty? You might wanna wash your face. - Well, hello there. - Hello, young man. - Isn't it a beautiful day? - You take care of your mother, now. - Thanks. - Have a good one. - Bye-bye. - Why is everybody smiling like that? - Because scowling is very un-Southern. - All right now, over and out. - It's pretty cool, right? - Yeah. - Whoop, sorry, ma'am. - I'm not a ma'am. - All right, pardon me. - Katherine would do. - All right, Kath... Kat Phillips? Kat Phillips. I didn't even recognize you. - Well, clearly. - You look incredible. I mean, you know, for someone who's aged as much as you have. - Oh, stop. - I can't believe this is you. Wow. It's been a long time. - Yep. - How long are you in town for? - Oh-- - We should get a coffee or something. - We're pretty busy here. - Hey, big guy. What's your name? - I'm Zack. - Zack? It's very nice to meet you. I'm Caleb. Now, let me ask you somethin', Zack. Does your mom drink coffee? - No. - Yes. - She does? - No. - Yes you do! - I'll take that as a yes. - We have to go by Greenhall's store. - That's perfect, Mr. Greenhall's store's right down here. It's on the way. Kat Phillips, and young Zachary. Now this is somethin'. - Impressive, you got a badge and everything. - Oh, yeah. A lot of power comes with this kind of thing. - I'm sure. - Caleb, have you ever seen a alligator? - Oh, tons. - Have you ever wrestled one? - Have I ever wrestled an alligator? Check that out. - Whoa! - Wow. - Whoa! - Huh? - Hey, I'm goin' inside to drop these off, are you coming with me? - Nah. - Nah, all right. Hang out here in the corner please, where I can see you. - Okay. - Okay. - Where did you really get that thing? - Oh, I fell off my bicycle. Cute kid. - Thanks. - He's got your nose. And your scowl. Yep, that's the one. - All right. - So, are you and your husband just in town for the holiday, or y'all just-- Mr. Greenhall. - Hey, Caleb. - Hi. - Kat Phillips? - Yes, sir. - Welcome back. - Thanks. - Heard you got married. - I did. - Didn't take, huh? - No, sir, it did not. - Your lights came in. They said the white ones should be in tomorrow. - Okay. The town's decorating budget got slashed, as I'm sure you can see, so I'm just tryin' to help out as much as I can on a ranger's budget. - Yeah. Were you flirtin' with me, when you thought I was married? - No! No, I was just catchin' up with an old friend. But I mean, this opens up a world of possibilities. - Caleb, meet me at the Boudreaux's. The duck's gone missin' again. - You need to get that? - No, we-- - Let's go, let's go, let's go. Beth to Caleb. - Rain check on that coffee, Katty. - All right. - Mr. Greenhall. - See you later, Caleb. - Caleb, we don't have all day. - Yeah, on my way, Beth. - Well, sir, it looks like you still have a whole bunch of these. - Oh, we can always use more. - Yeah? - There's a whole bunch of stuff. There's a big crowd. - Remember when you used to work here on Saturdays? - Of course I do. - I could use some help now. - Oh, really? - Well, I mean, Christmas rush is comin', you know, any day now. - You are too sweet, thank you. All right. - Tell your mom I sold another one. - Thank you so much. - Oh, before you go. - I missed this. See you around. - Bye-bye. - Hey, pal. You make a friend? - Maybe. Sienna says they don't have a Santa Claus down here. - Well, that's true. - But didn't you say he was real? - Yeah, honey, down here they've got Papa Noel. - Mm-kay, but what's the difference? - Difference, all right, well, Santa rides in a sleigh pulled by-- - Reindeer. - Yes, very good. But down here, they don't have sleighs or reindeer. And do you know why? - There's no snow. - Exactly. You are so smart. Do you know how Papa Noel gets all the presents to the good little girls and boys? - No. - He rides in a boat pulled by alligators. - Whoa. - Whoa. And every Christmas Eve, they light bonfires all along the bayou here to light the way for him. - Why? - So he doesn't get lost. - Why can't his elves just make him a GPS? - That's a great question, Zack. Hi, ma. - Hey, hi. How was town? - You know, it was really nice. - Yeah. You know, I think Zack's havin' a great time here. - I hope so. He's havin' such a hard time in school. I just think this change of scenery is good for him, you know. - You know, you really oughta put that thing away. - I wish, this is all work stuff. - I thought you came here for vacation. You know, spend a little time with me and Zack. - Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing, but I'd still like a job when I get back home. - 'Kay, well, put that away for now. Put it away. - Hmm, all right. - Take this out to the table. Mm-hmm. Thank you, sweetie. - Why is this table set for four? - Is it? - Mom, who'd you invite? - Oh, just a friend. - A friend. - Margaret. - Margaret, oh yes. Margaret, who has been dead for four years? That Margaret? - Well, in that case, she won't eat much, will she? - Hmm. Mama, who'd you invite? - Caleb, look! - Well. What? - Great. - Caleb wanted to know if you had a boyfriend. - He did, did he? - That was supposed to be between us guys, buddy. - Huh. - Oh, you think you can get it by me? Is that the way you think this is gonna go? Can you do this, oh! - I did it! - Good work! - Dang! - Did you see that, Mom? I did. - Zack, Zack, Zack, Zack! All right, that's good. Let's try it again. Oh! - That boy likes you. - Well he better, I gave birth to him. - I meant Caleb. - I know. - Nobody saw that, nobody saw that! - I was artfully dodging. Mind if I join you? - You know, you're gonna be here for two weeks. Why don't you just spend some time with him? - Mom, it's not about me. I gotta worry about Zack, okay? And I'm not gonna march a parade of men in and out of his life. It's not fair. - Honey, it's just a date. I think it'd be good for ya. - I don't know. I'm not interested in what's good for me. Just what's good for Zack. - Who says you can't have both? - What do we have here, grits? - Uh-huh, and sweet tea. Boy fits right in. - Mom, can I go outside and play now? - Mm, should we let him? Yes. - Yes. - But don't go far, okay? If you can't see the house, I can't see you. - Okay, okay, mom. Goodbye. - He'll be fine. - These your cheesy ones? - Yeah. Aw. - Aah! Aah, I can't swim! Somebody help me! Please, I can't swim! Help me! Somebody help! Where am I? - Well, you fell in the bayou in front of my house. Fortunately, I got to you before the gators did. You feelin' better now? - Yeah. - Well, when you get home, you get your mama to sign you up for swimmin' lessons. Yeah, when the soccer season's done. - How'd you know about that? - Oh, I know lots of t'ings. Yeah. Your mama used to play around my house when she was a little girl. All the kids did. They don't come around much anymore. They just seem too busy. Too busy. Starin' at the little glass screen. - That's what I want for Christmas. But my mom couldn't find me one. But maybe my grandma Lilly will. - Maybe Santa Claus will find it for you. - There's no such thing as Santa Claus. Santa Claus is not real. - You seem awful sure of that. - Can I call my mom to come and get me? - No. I don't got me no telephone. - Well then, how do you talk to people? - Ahh. The good old-fashioned Southern way, my boy. Face to face. Face to face. What's this generation comin' to? My, my, my. Young Zack, time to go! Zack, come on, let's go. Now, look here. You see that road there? - Yeah. - See the bend there? You go around that bend. Then you hit some dipsy-doodles. Not big, little dipsy-doodles. And it straightens out. And ends up right at your grandmama's house. - I will? But I thought it was-- - What? No, you thought wrong. I'm doin' the thinkin' right now, bub. Okay? All right, you end up at your grandmama's house, and that's where you better go, without fail. - Okay. Thanks, Nick. - Well, it's always great to meet new friends, you know? And you are a new friend. Now, y'all stay away around water, you hear me? Be careful. - Yes, sir. - Hey, hey. Now, you be good. - Yes, sir. - Christmas is comin'. Goodbye, my new friend! - Oh my gosh, Zack! Are you okay? What in the world happened to you? - I fell in, I was catching frogs, but Nick saved me-- - Baby! - Caleb! - Hey, buddy, whoa. - Caleb! - Did you take a dip-- - We need to get you in the bath. - I'll take him up there. - Mom, is he okay? - Of course he's okay. A little bayou water never hurt anybody. Good to see you, Caleb. - And you, Ms. Lilly. - Well, what is this about? - Well, I couldn't take you to coffee, so I thought I'd take the coffee to you. I live to serve. - I think he likes you, mom. - Zack, Zack! Thank you, Caleb. - Hi. Okay. Hi, sleepy-boy. Are you all cozy? - Yeah. - Good. - Mom. - Mm-hmm? - I like it here. - Good. I love you. - Here you go, honey. - Oh, thanks, mama. - You're welcome. - That was quite an adventure for him today. - I think it was harder on his mama than it was on him. That boy has quite an imagination. - Yeah? I worry about him every day. - Oh, honey. What's the point in worrying? Worrying doesn't get you anywhere. I should know. I worry about you every day. He is right about one thing, though. I do think Caleb has a thing for you. - Oh, stop. - He does. - I am not interested in that man's thing, okay? - You used to like him. - I was 12. - You had better taste in men when you were 12, than when you were 20. Sorry. - You'd dare. All right, then. What about you? Why are you still single after all these years? - I never met a man as good as your daddy. - Good morning. - Hey. Change your mind? - No, sir, I just came to check on my mom's herbs here. How're they selling? - Great. - Business could probably be a little better, huh? - Well, you know, business could always be better. But as for your mom's herbs, they're selling like catfish. - Are you the only one who's buying these things, Mr. Greenhall? What about the jam over here? - Ms. Ellsworth has four kids at home and an out-of-work husband. - And the quilts? - Ms. Alison's mother's not doing well. - Sir, you are not a shopkeeper. You're a Saint. - Hey, Kat? Mr. Greenhall. Looks like a man that could use a satchel of oregano. - Oh, I'll take 'em all. - Yeah, you cook? - No, but the oregano helps hide that little fact. Hey, I was gonna ask ya, you wouldn't happen to be free next Tuesday, would ya? - Why? - I think he's about to ask you out. - I was actually. - Okay, well don't do that. I'm leavin' right after Christmas, I don't want it to get weird. - I know, which is every time I see you. - All right, maybe it's better if we don't see each other, then. - Well, it's kind of a small town for that. - All right, so I won't go where you go, and you just don't go where I go, starting with this store. - But I like to shop here. - Sorry, dibs. - Well, all right, what about the hardware? - That's all yours. - The diner, you know I'm a sucker for Julia's peach cobbler. - Yours. If I get the store, that seems like a fair trade. - Well, I prefer the store. - Sorry, you can't have the store. - How about bingo, you know I like my bingo. - Bingo belongs to you. - How about a map of the town for you? - No, I think this about settles it. Deal? - Deal. - Hi, honey. - Hi, mom. - You know, I was just thinking. You should learn how to relax. - Well, I am relaxed. As you can see, I am currently reclined. - Well, if you can't let go of work when you're 1,000 miles away from the office, I can only imagine what it must be like in that city. - Well, if I can deliver this account by the end of the year, then there's no way Josh is gonna be able to overlook me for that promotion. - Oh, I see. - It's a really big deal, you know. I mean, if I can make this happen, then I'll finally be on track. - For what? - Well, my life? - Oh, honey. You can't chase happiness. You gotta find it where you are. - Let me guess! You come here for another swim? Hey, Zack! Zack! - Did you make all those toys? - I did. - Whoa. - Your mama know you're here? - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. Well. You want somethin' to drink? - Can I please have some hot chocolate? - How is it I know that you don't come from here? - I always drink hot chocolate at Christmastime. - Well, I can't argue with that, I guess. Let's see what we can arrange. Hot chocolate. - How'd you do that? - Because I'm Santa Claus. - Pfft. Yeah, right. You're Santa Claus. - Now, how'd you like to learn that song that I've been hummin' all morning? It'd be good to present for yourself at the pageant audition that your mama signed you up for. - My mom did not sign me up for any pageant. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. It goes like this. - Wow. - Hmm? - That's a catchy tune, bud. Where'd you learn that? - Nick taught me! - Oh, Nick. - Did you guys have fun today? - Yeah. He said he was Santa Claus. Did you know that? - Well, he is, yeah. At the bonfires, I told you that. - Oh. Right. - Hey! Was in the neighborhood, I'm heading into town. Y'all need a ride? - Yeah! - No, thank you. - Oh, I don't think we made the truck out of bounds, did we? - Right after this, it's the first thing on my list. - Hmm, okay. Where you guys goin'? - I signed Zack up for the pageant. - You did? - I did, it was gonna be a surprise. Surprise! - All right, it's the pageant, huh? Man, I was in that every year. I was the best elf this town ever saw, actually. - Yeah, I'll give him that. He was pretty cute in his little pointy shoes. - What were you again? You were a Shepherd, or was it a lamb? A little baby cow? - I was not a cow, sir. I was head angel. - I don't think there was a head angel-- - There was, and it was me. - Well. - Hold on, I gotta take this. - Why? - It's work. - Come on, you're on holiday. Yeah. - Yeah, mom, you're on a holiday. - Yeah, mom. Dude! - Not cool. Hey, okay. Caleb! Come on, okay. That's hilarious. Zack, please give me the phone. - Oh! - Please, come on, be a grown-up! Be a grown-up! - It's for your own good, mom! - I am your mother! Can you just give me the phone! Stop! You guys, come on. - You seem so stressed out, I just think if we-- - Yeah. - Got rid of the phone-- - Yeah, you know what. I wasn't stressed out before. I'm a little stressed out right now. Zack, please give mom the phone. - Nope! - Please. Zack! - Oh! - I can't believe you just did that! - For your own good, mom. - Okay. You are very lucky this is not broken, young man. Fine. You win. - Wow. You ready, bud? Aw, come on, look, we're here, all right? So you just get up there, you give it a shot. What's the worst thing that could happen? - Please, mom. Don't make me do this. - In the key of C, elves. One, two, three-- - Zack, come on, honey, it's not that bad. You can still go back in there. - I wanna go home. I told you, I couldn't do this. - Zack. - Oh. - All right. You got everything, honey? - All right! - Oh! Thanks. - Mm-hm. - Come on, pal. - Got it, buddy? - Thank you so much for the ride. - Oh, you haven't heard? Been invited for supper. Sound good, Zack? - Cool. - Yeah. - When we were negotiating places that were off limits, I did mean to add my house. - That's an oversight on your part, I think. - Shut up. Sorry about my mother. She's not very subtle, is she? - Ah, no, I remember. - Yes. Yes, she always had a sweet-spot for you. Remember prom? Prom night, she's trying to get you to take me with my sad, little date standing right there. David. - David! - He was so sweet. - He did not like that. - No. - No he did not. You wanna catch some frogs? - I thought you would never ask. - Okay, let me ask you this. When we find one-- - If we find one. - When we find one! - If, come on! - When we find one, are you gonna pick it up with your hands, or are you gonna be too afraid, city girl? - Don't even. I was so much better at this than you were. - Oh, what? - I'm just saying. - Oh, wait, wait, wait. - You got somethin'? - I think I'm seein' eyes. - Where? - Oh, look right there. I think there's some. You don't see it right there? - No! Where are you lookin'? - Oh, that's just a snake. - Aah! Shut up! You're such a punk! Caleb... I can't. - I know, I know, I know. - I'm sorry. - I know. I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry. I can't. - No, I know. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Why didn't you try? - I don't know. - You wanna be in the pageant? - Doesn't matter. I never get the things I want. - There was a Christmas some few years ago, your mama really, really wanted a kitten for Christmas. She told everybody that she wanted a kitten. Well... And finally, when the kitten didn't come, she said she didn't believe in Pere Noel or Santa Claus anymore. And then a few weeks after that, a stray kitten found her. - What'd she do with it? - What, she kept it! In the neighbor's shed. The Bienvenue family, I believe. Cutest little thing. Yeah, she didn't tell a soul. - Then how do you know? - Don't you know? I'm Pere Noel. You still don't believe me, do you? - No. - Okay, okay. Last Christmas you wrote a letter to Santa Claus on green construction paper. And you even included two stamps just in case. You only wanted one thing. - My dad. - Mm-hm. - But he never came! - Mm-hm. - I mean, I was so good that whole year! - I know, yeah. - And that's all I wanted. Why didn't he come? - Well, sometimes we want things we can't get. Don't get. So we go to other t'ings... that make us happy. My pal. - Hi. - Oh, good. Hi. - They didn't have baking soda so I just got baking powder. That's, like, the same thing, right? - I've failed you miserably. - Where's Zack? - Mom, mom, come see! - Well, let's go look. - Okay. - Here they come, here they come, here they come, you ready? Step, step, step. You used to count there. - I know there's steps! - I know, I know. - Give you the best seat in the house. - Quit asking questions. Because it's a surprise! - All right. - Look who's here! - Hey! - Hey. All right, one, two, Zach! - You guys! - How's it look? What do you guys think? - It's perfect. - It's Christmas. - Hey, we okay? - Yeah, we're okay. - Okay, all right. All right. Well, hey, skippy-pants. Where you headed off to so fast? - It's a secret, mom. - What, you're really not gonna tell me? - Nope! - Caleb? - Bye, mom! - Nope, we're not gonna tell you. - Bye, mom! See you soon! Bye, mom! - You ready for this? - Yeah. - All right, buddy. Game-face on, okay? - Okay, Zack? - You can do it, Zack. - He's not singing. - Ssh. - I can't do this. - It's okay, honey. Take a breath. Wait, Zack... - Don't worry, you'll still get a part. - Yeah, but it won't have any words! - No one asked you, Bryce. - Bryce, Sienna, you're up. - Nice try, Zack. - Bryce! Are you two ready with your song now? - That was so much fun. - How long ago did he leave? - Miss Janelle said she last saw him 20 minutes ago. I don't know how I missed him. - I'll be right there. - All right, see you here. - Hey, mom, I gotta go look for Zack. Can you just stay here in case he comes back? - Yeah, of course. - Thank you! Zack? Caleb, hey. Any word? - Kat, I don't want you to worry-- - I can't believe he did this, he was so happy-- - Okay? - When he left today. - He can't be far, I'm telling you. I think I know where he might be. Let's start down by the water. - Zack! Did you see him with the other kids? - No, no they had all left, and he was gone already. - Zack! How can I make it better, bud? - Will you tell me a story? - Yeah. - Tell me about your kitten. - Who told you about that? - Nick told me. - I didn't think I ever told anybody. Okay, yeah, well, it was the beginning of the school year. And I was havin' kind of a rough time. Wasn't very good at makin' friends. - Kinda like me. - But then this thing just came into my life and made it better. He was this little gray and white tabby. He was awesome. - What'd you name him? - Kitty. I know it's not terribly original, but I was, like, seven, so you're gonna have to cut me some slack. But for, like, a whole year, he was just the best friend I could ask for. I'd sneak him food after school, and just play with him for hours. - What happened to him? - You know, I don't know. I went to the shed one day and he was gone. And I just figured the Bienvenues got wise and took him to a shelter. - Were you sad? - Yes. But by that point, school was a lot better. You know? I'd make a couple buddies. - Maybe Papa Noel brought you that kitten. - Maybe. He was exactly the right thing at exactly the right time. Just like you. - I'm way better than any kitten. - Yes, Zack, you are. Sir, I have been thinking a lot about your situation, and I know that I can help. Now, you said Christmas was your busiest time of year, right? So let's just make that your focus. - People 'round here don't have a lot of use for tinsel in August. - Oh, that's okay, we're gonna think bigger. - Bigger? - An online presence. Now, we're gonna cater to the scores of people that want a little taste of the south, all year round. We are going to make you a destination, sir. We can tweet when any new product comes in, and I have already set up a brand-spanking-new website for you. - You're sayin' a lot of words that mean absolutely nothing to me. - Mr. Greenhall, do you trust me? - Could you make it snow? - Can I make it snow? - Yeah. Because if you're really Papa Noel, couldn't you make it snow? Like... Like a Christmas miracle. - Well, snow in the bayou may do more harm than good. But I'll make a deal with you. - What kind of deal? - I'll give you your Christmas miracle if you promise to go back to the pageant. - But everyone laughed at me. - Are you gonna let a couple of naughty kids stop you? Stop you? - Yes. - Is the pageant important for you? - Well, it was a gift for my mom. So... - That's an amazing gift to be able to give to somebody. Be a shame if, if she didn't get it. - It's too late now. - Says who? - All right, one, two, three, four. Okay, theater, we're short an alligator. There should be eight. Wait a minute, hey, hey, ssh! Easy, off the ground, please. Absolutely not, no. Listen, guys, we are having a run through, please. Run through! 15 minutes! Is anyone listening? Aah! That's enough. - Miss Janelle? - Oh, Hi, Zack. Hey, ssh! Hey, hey, hey! - Could I try again? - Oh, I'm sorry, Zack. Everyone's got their part, sweetheart. - Could I try something else? - What did you have in mind, sweetheart? - Something special. - Is Zack still in the bathroom? Should I go get him? - Oh, honey, give the boy some privacy. - Next up, from New York City, singing a Cajun favorite, Zack! - Zack, our Zack? - How does Zack know a Cajun favorite? - You can do it, Zack. - This is for my mom. - I just can't even, did you have fun? - Great job, buddy! - You were really good. - Could I steal my grandson and his friend Bryce? - Oh. - I've got a town full of people who wanna meet the stars of the show. - Okay. - Hey, come here for a sec. - Where are we going? - Well, it's been a pretty good night, but, I wanna make it perfect. - What about Zack? - Oh, he's good, he's got his fans over there. We'll be right back. Come on. - I mean, I'm just sayin'. He's pretty good. So where are we going? - Hold on, well, I'll show you. Look over there! - Okay. - Don't ruin my surprise! I'll tell you when, I'll tell you when. All right. - All right? - And... Look at that. Huh? - Wow. - It's a boat! - I know, I get it. - No, I know, but you know, it's... Okay, look, so I've been, I've thought about you a lot since you've been gone. And I was thinkin', what do you think would have happened to us if I had kissed you at that bonfire. - Oh, no. - Well, no, 'cause it's like that night jinxed us. You know, it's like I couldn't get it together after that. - Oh, Caleb, we're buddies! - Yes, but what if, you know, what if we're supposed to be more. I finally got my second chance, and since, you know, this is our first official date-- - Stop! - I figured I should make it memorable. Come on, let's just get in for a second. - No, I can't. - It's totally safe. - It's not the boat. No, I can't do this, Caleb. I just, I cant do this. - 'Cause... I'll drive. - Zack's dad left us, and it crushed my kid. I'm not ever gonna put him through anything like that ever again, okay? I just, I can't. - Well, I mean, I'm not him though. - Right, you aren't, but I don't take risks anymore. I'm just not that person. I'm sorry. - No, no, it's, you know. Okay, okay. No, it's, it's... All right, I'm gonna head back. - Yes, we're good, yes. - You can, no shame if you want to take it out. - Thank you. - All right. Night. - Goodnight. - Katty! Katty. Good morning! - I'll give you morning. I don't know how good it is. - You know, there's a very disappointed little boy who's missing his new best friend right now. - Mom, Caleb is busy. He's got a job. - What'd you do? - Why do you assume I did something? Fine. I hurt him. - And now you're ignorin' him? Oh, Katty, talk to him! - He does not wanna talk to me. - Of course he wants to talk to you! - I can't, mom. I just, I can't. - There's coffee. - And come again. - Hi, Mr. Greenhall. - Hey, Katherine. Could you believe this? People have been comin' in here all morning, from places I've never even heard of. - Oh, that's wonderful. - Sure I can't offer you that job? It'd sure be nice to have you here all the time. - I'm sorry. - All right. - Hey, you haven't seen Caleb, have you? - Hm, no, I haven't. - Oh, all right. We'll keep askin', buddy. Thanks. - All right, I'll see you. - I'll see you around. He passed out as soon as his little head hit the pillow. - Well, that boy had a rough day. - Yeah. How about this, though? You like it? As promised, done before Christmas Eve. - Well, you certainly cut it close. Can you get that? - Yeah. - Hey. - Hi. - Listen, I was out Christmas shopping, and I have this I wanted to give you before you leave. - What is it? - It's a gift, it's one of those fancy tablets. It's for Zack. - Where did you find this? - Oh, just because your big city's out, doesn't mean little old St. Martinville is. - Oh, you. - He's a good kid. I'm really gonna miss him. What? - You're a really good man, Caleb. - Well, tell him I said, all right. - Josh, that is great news, yes. Yeah, I can be there tomorrow. Of course, I mean, I would have to leave today, but I can make that happen. Oh, I know it's Christmas Eve. Just means Christmas in New York, after all. Well, great! In the meantime, I've had some new thoughts about the Turner account. So I'll just email them to you ahead of time so you have 'em. Great, yeah, and if there's anything else, please do not hesitate to call me on my cell. We'll both be working Christmas, huh? All right, I'll see you soon. Bye. - Whoa. Oh, my gosh. - Zack, I am not telling you again. You do not run off like that, okay? - I'm sorry. - Yeah, I'm sorry, too. - I don't wanna go home today. I like it here. - I know you do. But vacations don't last forever, bud. And this is good. This promotion means more money, okay? - I don't want more money. I want more of you! That's what I really want for Christmas. I want more of you. - What you got in that bag? - Nick gave it to me. Mom... Is it okay that I believe in Santa Claus now? - Of course it is. It is always okay to do the things that make you happy. - That goes for you too. - Honey, can I convince you to stay one more day? It's Christmas Eve. - Hey, can you watch Zack for a minute? I just have to go see about something. - Yeah, of course. - Hey, Caleb. - Hey, Beth. - So I heard an ugly rumor that you were skipping out on the bonfire tonight. - Yes, afraid so. - Caleb, you never miss the bonfire. - I know, it's just, heart's not really in it this year. - Suit yourself. - Hi, Mr. Greenhall. - Hey, Katherine. Looks like we're in for a great night for the bonfire, doesn't it? - Yes, sir. Hey, about that job offer. Is that still on the table? - What about New York? - I love what I do, but that's not the only place I can do it from. So I'm here to work if you'll have me. - Step into my office. - Yeah? - Our office. - Our office! Great! Oh, thank you, sir. Hi, mama. - Hey, baby. - So looks like I got a new job. - Oh, that fancy promotion? - Mm, no. I bought half of Mr. Greenhall's store. Looks like Zack and I are gonna need a place to live. You got any ideas? - Maybe. Welcome home, baby! Oh, welcome home. Oh! - This is even better than I remembered! What do you think, Zack? - Whoa! - Who did this? - Never question a Christmas miracle. - Hi, Zack, merry Christmas. - Hey, mom, can I go play with my friend? - Yeah, of course! - Hey, Sienna, merry Christmas. - Hey! Can I go play with my friends? - Of course! - Okay, I'll be back. Bye, mama. - I'll see you. - Josh? Hi. It's Katherine, look, I hate to call you on Christmas Eve, but, I just wanted to say that I'm gonna have to extend my trip for a very long time. Happy, happy holidays. Hi! - Hey. - Do you know where I could find Caleb? - I'm sorry, he's not comin' tonight. - He's not? - Uh-uh. You have a merry Christmas. - Thank you. You came. - Ah, you know I couldn't stay away. - Hey, do you wanna take a walk with me? - Last time I left this spot with you, it didn't go so well for me. - How about a do-over? - All right. - So... I've been thinking a lot about what I want in my life, and everything I want is right here. Right here with my mom and Zack. And you. You're not looking away. - No. I mean, is there something really interesting I should look at? - No. Caleb. - Yeah, Kat? - Are you gonna kiss me? - Yes, ma'am. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Papa Noel! Bye! - Love! Love, it makes the world go round, no? A-ha! Merry Christmas to you!
