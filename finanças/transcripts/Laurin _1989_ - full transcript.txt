LAURIN Laurin! Laurin! Where are you hiding again? Come home at once. It was on that day in March 1901 that death struck for the first time in the shape of the bogeyman. Evil was was lurking amongst the people of a peaceful dreamy harbour town. Flora, stop it! Aren't you ashamed in front of the child? - Daddy will be back soon, Laurin. - Soon? - Two or three months, as always. - That's what you always say. Last time it was half a year. It's about time, Arne. Let's get going. Mother, I'll take Arne down to the harbour. Take the lantern along, a storm is coming. I can feel it in my bones. Okay, I'll get it. I worry about you every time, my boy. Arne, we both know all about the big cities and their evils. Don't you ever forget that your father has left us for a cheap whore. I know I'm an old woman and that I talk drivel sometimes. I just couldn't stand it a second time. Don't ever forget where your home is, no matter where you are. How did you get here, little boy? Someday I'll take you along. And we'll sail down the river. - And out to the deep blue sea. - Arne! - Arne, I'm pregnant. - Arne, hurry up! We're leaving! - Really? - Really. - Arne, do you have any idea where Van Rees is? - Why? If he hasn't reported back to the commander by tomorrow morning, he'll be in hot water. - He'll show up. Good evening. Good evening. Damn it! Shut this brat up, will you? Help! Help! Somebody help me! Help! Laurin? Oh my God. Why did you take Flora away from us, Lord? Why is it always the innocent that are sought by misfortune? Have you seen a little boy? Ten years old. This is his brother. He has gone missing last night. Hey, you there! Leave the girl alone! Get out of here, you filthy scum! What are you waiting for? Come to me, poor child. Laurin... Grandmother? Your daughter needs you now, Mr. Andersen. You mustn't give up. You will see Flora again. FLORA ANDERSEN Born - 7.11.1873 Died - 12.3.1901 WHERE DEATH IS NO MORE WE'LL MEET AGAIN Hello, where did you come from? I haven't seen you around here before. Where did you get this cat from? Shush! Grandma is allergic to cats, she sneezes everytime a cat is near. I know where we can hide it. Since my husband's death his boat has been moored unused in the harbour. I don't mean to meddle, but maybe it would be better for your daughter, if you gave up being a sailor for good? You could provide for your family as a fisherman, too. - I can't, Mrs. Berghaus. If you went to sea as long as I have, it won't let you go again. It holds on to you with all its strenght. It owns you forever. It's dangerous up here. Listen! Rats! Put that back! What's with the cloak? - What's the matter with you? - Stefan? Where are you? We're leaving. Can't you hear? Your mother's calling? Father, look what I found in the attic! Will you be away for as long as last time? I know you would like me to be back for your birthday. You won't be. Don't start pulling such a wry face. Your holidays will soon be over. And when school has started again you'll have other things on your mind. I'll bring you something pretty. And when you're older you can come along. How would you like that? - Promised? - On my honour. Why don't you wear your hair loose? Have a look in the mirror. You're such a pretty girl. You know your grandmother can't stand cats. Promise you won't let that cat into the house. - How did she try? - What are you talking about? You know, Mrs. Berghaus. As if you didn't know. Since you concocted the whole thing together. I'm only thinking of you. And Laurin. I'm not getting married again. That's my final word. Have you forgotten? Flora was expecting a baby! - Arne. Your wife is dead. - Stop it, mother! Enough of that! Enough of that cursed bridge and that accident! And what about Laurin? Your daughter needs you! Do you know how much you mean to her? - Leave Laurin out of it! You know I love her more than anything. But I'm a sailor! Like your father, I know. He was only happy when he was aboard. But don't you forget, I'm an old lady in a wheelchair. Something could happen to me anytime, and then Laurin is all on her own. My poor girl. Father! Father! Father! You tried to pull our legs again, Van Rees! Giving us that rubbish about having no girlfriend waiting at home. - Who is that girl? - Huh? I would love to see Arne's face when he learns that his little daughter mistook you for her father. Mr. Van Rees. I didn't recognise you at first. Why weren't you at the port last night? - Your father was there waiting for you. - Last night? - Isn't he home? - He is with Mrs. Berghaus. Little Stefan is down with fever. Well, now you are here. Come on in. Don't stand there in the doorway. Nothing has changed. I left everything as it was. Still no mirrors in the house I suppose. The Pastor says that mirrors are instruments of human vanity. If you don't mind my saying so, Mr. Van Rees, these years in the military have made a stately man out of you. Not everyone can become a corporal within two years. Your father is very proud of you. - Oh, is he? Your poor mother's death still torments him. Since then he's built all his hopes on you. May I prepare you something for supper? Nothing for now. If you would excuse me now, Mrs. Johannson, I'm very tired. Yes, take a rest. I'm sure your father will be back soon. I'll beat the life out of you, you wretched little scum. No, father, please don't, don't hit me! I won't do it again. Your poor mother is crying all the time because of that wretched, evil son of hers! He killed the kitten with a slingshot. Father! What a joy to have you back again, my son. Finally our little family is reunited again. And I have good news for you. The village has decided that you should become the new school teacher. Oh, grandmother. Why aren't you in bed? Laurin, my child... The shutters. What about them? The morning sun... hurts my eyes. Forgive me, Sophie. SOPHIE VAN REES Oh, no. Who did that? Are you sad that your kitten died? I never had a cat. We had dogs when I was a boy. The first one ran away one night in winter. He never showed up again. Laurin! Wait! What happened to you? Stefan, be more careful with your glasses. Ever seen a classroom upside down? No? Then it's about time. - Let me go! - Hey, leave Stefan alone! - Laurin is in love with Stefan. - Stop it! Are you crazy? Get him out of there! Hold still or the whole cabinet will tip over. Come in. Stand up! Good morning, children. Good morning, Mr. Engels. Take your seats. You'll have to curb them strongly, Mr. Van Rees. I know what I'm talking about. With an iron hand. Kindness won't get you very far. See that mirror? You can't afford to turn your back on that cheeky lot for a single second! Don't ever take your eyes off them, that's most important. There are a couple of hopeless cases in here. Mr. Engels! They hung him into the cabinet. I know who did it. Out of the way! Go! Back to the classroom! - Mr. Van Rees. Those wretched children always have to bully my boy. And you couldn't harm a fly. Last time they hid his glasses in the water bucket. The poor boy is almost blind without his glasses. Promise me you'll take care of Stefan. He can't look out for himself. You scared me. How did you get here, little boy? Stefan! I don't like having little girls spy on me. Laurin... Good morning, Laurin. Good morning, Mr. Van Rees. Don't forget our money. We somehow have to make a living, too. Poor motherless child. Every year it's the same. The father sails off and leaves his little one with old Olga. Eventually they run out of money and are down on their uppers. It's just dreadful. How much does the little girl owe you? Thirteen pfennigs. - How is your head? - Much better, Mr. Van Rees. Very well. I talked to Mr. Engels, he updated me on your current level of knowledge. Some of you he called hopeless cases. He also told me some names. As far as I'm concerned, there's no such thing as a hopeless case. You all will be studying hard in order to get promoted. Unfortunately, and this makes me very sad, the person who hung poor Stefan into the cabinet still hasn't reported to me. However, if the guilty one admits to his dirty trick until this afternoon, I will abstain from punishment. - Mr. Van Rees! - What's your name? - Wiebke. - Wiebke? Isn't that a girl's name? Hello, I'm Wiebke. Wanna marry me? My name is Nikolas, Wiebke is my last name. Alright. You wanted to say something? - He wanted to snitch! - Liar! I'll break your neck if you don't keep your mouth shut. Come see me after class. We can talk in private then. Do you think I should tell Mr. Van Rees who did it? - Let me see that. - Give it back! What have you got there that is so important, Laurin? Why don't you bring it to me? Looks like we have a little artist among us. Mrs. Berghaus. I didn't hear you come in. Excuse me for bursting in on you like this, but my son finally told me who the culprit was. - Culprit? That terrible Enno! He's the one who hung my poor darling into the cabinet. Ah, that's what you meant. But that's not why I came to see you, Mr. Van Rees. I certainly don't want to impose on you, but I'd be delighted if you joined us for supper tonight. That's very kind of you. - But I can't possibly accept. - Believe me, it won't cause any trouble. Otherwise I wouldn't invite you. My son and I don't have company very often. And you have taken care of Stefan so lovingly. Please, come. I hope you'll have an appetite. See you tonight. What's that? Do you have a secret admirer? Christian friends, do you want to know? Who is that man who's tortured so? The answer's known to every fool. The teacher in the village school. - I think it's time to tell Stefan, that you're his father. - I leave that to you. My life is worn away with sorrow. And my years with sighing. Strong as I am I stumble under my load of misery. All my fears rise up to mock me. My neighbors find me a burden. My friends shudder at me. Who sees me in the street turns away. I am forgotten like one who is dead. I have become like a broken vessel. I hear the voices around me whispering of my plight. Fears rise up on every side. In league against me, as they are, and plotting to take my life. But, Lord, I put my trust in thee. I say "Thou Art My God". May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. - Amen. - Amen. He didn't sleep again all night. Someone's been creeping around our house for days now. May the Lord protect you, my son. Catch me, Stefan. My bodice! Daddy, when will you take me to sea with you? - It's no place for little girls. - If only your father could hear that. It's getting cold. Laurin, do you like Mr. Van Rees? I don't know. I think he's okay. But sometimes he looks at me really funny. What do you mean? I don't know, just funny. Actually he isn't really a teacher. Father said city-schools are different. - In what way? - The teachers are different. You learn much more. Why do you want to learn so much? Too bad my father isn't a teacher. I'd better go now. Mother is probably already waiting for supper. I can cook something, too! We can kill a chicken. Better not. Mother will be mad if I get home late. Is Stefan still here? No, Mrs. Berghaus, he left a long time ago. I'm already waiting for hours. I won't let that boy leave the house anymore. Laurin! I've been looking for him everywhere! No one has seen him! Satisfying (Grade c). What's the matter, my boy? Father. - I didn't hear you come in. - Are you ill? Then get dressed and drum up the villagers. Little Stefan has dissapeared. Stefan! Laurin. Mother? I don't like having little girls spy on me. How did you get here, little boy? Help! Help! Help! Help! Shut up! Don't go, mother. Don't go! Don't go! Let's pray that little Stefan will soon be found. Amen. Amen. We'll review every single essay carefully. Why didn't you hand in your excersise book, Laurin? Have you lost your voice? Give me your excersise book. He left us... ... for a cheap whore! For... ... a cheap... ...whore. Stefan! Help me! Mr. Van Rees! You scared me! I don't like having little girls spy on me. Where did you find those glasses? Give them to me. The glasses! Grandmother! Open the door! Grandmother! Open the door! Open the door! Grandmother! Grandmother! Wake up! God is my witness. What have you done to the children? Laurin, my child, are you there? Yes, grandmother. I'm here.
