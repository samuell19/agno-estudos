lt's him. -She worked for Oxford. -Yes. Hilary Rule. Thank you. -He's just a writer! -And what does he just write? Would you mind if l moved around? l feel like she should be moving... Fine. -He's just a writer! -And what does he just write? -l'd like to ask him to dinner. -So he wants to meet me. Daddy, he's just a friend! Not all journalists are potential assassins. You know very well l never grant interviews. Henry says it would be bad for my health. Your book is nearly ready. Dave's finding his feet... This will be a world wide coup for him. And if you're clever... you can get him to write exactly what you want. l'm putting on so much weight casting this play. Every agent in town has been wining and dining me. You look not good. You should have the liver. Pump the iron. l never sleep very well in the lead up to a play. l just eat and brood. Well, there are some strong candidates. -Who was the one you liked? -What's her name? Hilary Rule. She was good, l thought. -Attractively young? -Well, she's in the average. She's very unexperienced. We could go for a real name, if you wanted. l thought the reason we were holding up this spot... -was to find someone new. -Let's see her with the American. He's got a strong presence, he could easily overpower her. He looked great today, l thought. Even better in the flesh than in that movie. He's coming! Turn that off! You don't call this music a rise? He hates that stuff! -Josie's had a baby! -Josie? Oh, your sister! And how is she? Ghastly! As predicted. Post natal maniac depression. She's unloaded that on mom and dad. Shit, You don't want to hear all this stuff. Go away, you two, and get on with it. l have to run again. Do you think it's a good sign? Well, they may want to try you acting with Robin Grange. He was incredible in that film, wasn't he? -What's he doing over here? -He's gotta a cue-in. He was down, used to be home after that he's been said that... Life theater is what you wanted to do right now. You're not right about you, are you? Felix. You don't think that they suspect anything, do you? -l mean, about us. -l'm certain they don't. You know, l was thinking. l could get you another flat. Right. You want me to be like a kept woman. To be your mistress, is that what you want? -l never insulted you, we know it. -What do you want me to say? l want us to be official, out in the open. lt's just that... lt's awkward. The walls are so thin! They must hear everything. We know the solution. You know l went to the country last weekend. To the cottage. Elena and l were standing at the edge of a cliff. She suddenly turned to me and she said... ''Now is your chance.'' ''Push me over.'' The terrible thing was, the thought had already crossed my mind. lt's Daddy, finally. -Who's winning? -United. Boring. All these messages, Felix. l had no idea when you'd be home. -l did say l'd be casting. -Danny, Manimoto. You never know how they're gonna go on these sessions. -Quite exhausting, actually. -Especially when they go late. -l learned a Debussy, dad. -Give me ten minutes, sweetheart. l hate waiting around, not knowing when to start dinner. You know with casting sessions there is no timing. l know how long they last! l've seen you through 11 plays. You didn't call because you were with her. This is your family, Felix. You're destroying it. Robin, Hilary. Hi, l saw you yesterday. You were great. Just forget we're here. -Liz told you the scene, didn't she? -Scene 6, page 24. -l'm sort of nervous. -Don't l know it... lt's like two big brothers taking notes while you go to the john. Try sitting on the couch. Snuggle up. lt's a moment of intimacy. He's a great man, remember. Hey, l'm a disciple. He's a God, as far as l'm concerned. But he has his human vanities. Kiss his ass, you mean. No, that's not a responsible thing. But don't try to impress him. Neither bump him as equal. Your father is no mere mortal. Then again, neither is his daughter. Jean and lan, remember they split up last Christmas. Jean plummeted and fell for a rock star. What's going on? There's some kind of mass neurosis? Male menopause. Women are about that as more often than not Did you know what l was thinking coming here tonight? You two are almost the only constant in my life. -Hello? -So you for us, Humphrey. l don't count. Miserable old bachelor. -Miss Right still eludes me. -lt's for you. Thank you. Hello? l know l shouldn't ring you home. l just had to tell you l got the part. Good. Thanks for letting me know. Goodbye. -You didn't even try to save it. -l'm so bored being golley. Stupid woman. What time will you be home tonight? l'll try not to be too late, but it's difficult. You can't even make time to discuss breaking up your family. You can't even make time for that! Well, l suppose you're wondering why l summoned you here today. l knew when l read it, we had a superlative play... l now know we have a cast to match. And we a director. Thank you. l concur with the endearing lack of false modesty... that is my trademark. Now, ''The Hit Man''. lt's a complex and demanding play... a moral fable for our morally and ambiguous times. The house of a great Jewish scholar, assassined at the gate... The wife, disabled by a bullet meant for her husband... The daughter, greatly loved... and greatly loving her adoptive parents. -Don't stop dancing! -l am! No, you're not. l'd be baffled to dance with you. You're the curtest dancer l've ever seen. -Make your hips move! -l am moving my hips! You are the counterpoint to the other lovers... The young and... how shall l put it? Ageless. Thank you. Will David betray his mission and risk dishonour... over that uniquely human thing called love? What is honour when it comes down to it? Just another relative human value. Honour is irrelevant, isn't it? Basically, he's a killer. A killer with a conscience. l mean, it's his moral duty to kill you. Morality has got nothing to do with it... Look, if you see your country occupied, thousands murdered... while the rest of them are herded into camps, and ghettos... l think you might consider it your moral duty. You're not defending terrorrism, surely... That good or bad are relative, is all l'm saying. Take your character, Theo. From my vantage point... he deserves to have his head blown the fuck off. l think if my children were killed l'd be capable of everything. Dear old Todd doesn't agree. He's still sulky. l'd better go cheer him up. Speaking of which... What's up with Felix? He looks like shit. lt might me a minor matter of extra marital nature. -l wouldn't know. -l thought he was... -Mr. Family Man. -Homo erectus desperatus. The eternal itch. lt happens to us all sooner or later. l think Theo is the best character in a modern play l've ever read. -Even if he deserves to be shot. -lt's a good part. lt's a great part. He basically carries the whole play. -lt's truly great casting. -Thank you. -What can l get you? -A large gin and tonic. A large gin and tonic for the lady. He still looks miserable. Any chance to get my part enlarged l've got to take. See you later. -Hey, Felix. How are you doing? -Fine, fine. Just wanted you to know l would have killed for this part. -l'm glad that was unnecessary. -lt's true though, l mean... those scenes with me and Rachel... She's great, Hilary, isn't she? She's a real find. You know what l mean, the tension, the suspense at the end... l have really fallen for it. l get to grab that gun, it's like... Man, it's some climax. British audiences are suspicious of happy endings. -Americans are just the opposite. -We don't trust happiness. Why, you think it's gonna be taken away or something? Or have too high a price. Morning! Daddy, what did you do with your hair? Danny, quick. Come and look at daddy's hair! He tried to cut it! lt looks gross! -l'm on the toilet! -Well, hurry up, then. She's always had a wild temper, but now she's gone crazy! lf l leave, l'm afraid she might damage herself as a revenge. That's terrible. That's just impossible. Oh, sorry! Will you be long? l've got an interview. Just a couple of minutes. Careful, Samson lost his power when Delilah cut his hair. l'll be seeing you on Saturday, Felix! -Saturday? -lt's her birthday. l'm sorry, Serena, it's just impossible! l think there'll be a playwright's conference. We can get away for that. lt's just two nights and it's not till the end of the month. l just can't stand much more of this. l know. l know. l'll change things. Somehow l'll do it. -How do l look? -A little bit younger. -A little bit. -lf you chop down that nose... -Humphrey, what a surprise! -Elena... Come on in! l promise not to stay. Just a few words with the great man. He's not here. l thought he was with you. Well, that was the idea. He had a few things to work out with Robin Grange. l thought he'd be back by now. -Never mind! l won't keep you... -No, stay! Let's have a drink. He'll be back soon. l'd love to. -lt appeals to you, doesn't it? -What? -Playing an assassin. -Yeah, l could be a killer... lt's a living. -Actually, set ups are my line. -Excuse me... -you're Robin Grange, aren't you? -Last time l looked. lt's just that l loved your last movie... especially the part when you wrote your phone number on her leg... lt's just my friend bet me that l wouldn't dare ask. Well, tell your friend she just lost the bet. Now promise me you'll never wash this off. No chance. Thank you. -What did you write? -My phone number. -Oh, Christ! -What's the matter? l'll be a minute. Hilary? You're not alone, are you? Felix, don't worry. There isn't any danger. -ls Serena with you? -Yes. l'll see you tomorrow. l love you. -Songs of your youth, Todd? -Never out of date. Do l detect a boyfriend, by any chance? Afraid so. He's checking out to see l'm not getting out to any mischief. And are you? Not tonight. He knows where l live. l'll never be safe now. l'm sorry, Elena. l've been discussing things. Getting on well with Robin? -He's got some good ideas. -l won't keep you long. l have a meeting with Michael after rehearsal. lt seems the audiences from Macular Deception are not picking up. He's wondering if we can't advance the opening date. We're not under enough pressure as it is? l got a strategy and l think it could work... lt can involve a lot more of dedication... -What have you found out? -Very little. A man rented the apartment for him several weeks before he arrived. A man? -A student, she thought. -She's never seen him again? Here, l have a new scene between you and Hilary... Rachel, which changes the dialogue in following scene. -Great. -You traced? You' ve ever traced? -You've traced the account? -lt states all about... -l like this guy. -You get off on him, don't you? l told you l was a mercenary heart. l'd do anything for money. -Anything legal. -Not necessarily. You're all right? Yeah... l'm just tired, that's all. -lt's a nerve-wracking time. -But there's no tension in you. There's no guilt. Felix! Cheers. lt's your marriage, isn't it? You know that fear is a gold fish bowl... and you have looked pretty beat up lately. What are people saying? Word is you wanna leave your wife for another woman... and now all hell's breaking loose. They say your wife... -My wife is blameless. -l'm sure she is. lt's the classic Beneau plot. Two people that could be happy together... but only at the expense of the third. l said l was a mercenary at heart. What? l said l was a mercenary. And what does that mean? -l could seduce your wife. -Are you crazy? l'm dead serious. -For Christ's sake. -lt'd give you some space. l'm not in the mood for playing games. l'll see you tomorrow. Felix! Think about it. -How are you? -Hi. Are you looking for Hilary? l think she and Serena went to a club. -You want to come in? -No, l don't, thanks. l'm surprised you bothered to come home. l haven't seen her tonight, l promise you. ls she great in bed? -Elena... the company's in trouble financially... -you've heard Humphrey... -l was great too, once. At least you made me feel that way. But it's hard to remember. When you won't touch me anymore. l'm like a piece of furniture. So Felix, what am l supposed to do to feel like a woman again? Shall l get a lover? Why don't you talk to me? Because whenever l try, you get upset. -Upset? l'm fucking mad! -We're both tired. We've been drinking. This isn't the best time! When is the best time? When l'm asleep? And for you to say you're going to walk out on us? Leaving me to cope with three heart broken children... ls that the best time? ls it? ls it? Listen, you'll wake the children! Fine! Then they will see what you're really like. l've done everything for you. Moved to your own country... built a home for you, then you could write. -Elena! -Leave me alone! Elena! -Shit! -What's happening? lt will be the security people. Can you get it, darling? -Help me! -Elena! -What's going on here? -What's happening? -lt's fine. She's upset, that's all. -What are you doing? l'm her husband, it's all right. lt's all under control. Are you sure you're all right? Mommy's all right. She's just tired, that's all. Mirrie, take Jessie back to bed. Danny, go to bed. Women are definitely the unstable sex. -We all have our ups and downs. -Where will you be staying? At the conference? ln a hotel. Five star luxury fifteen England's greatest living playwright! Can l call you there? lf the house burns down or if Mom needs to get hold of you? Because l'm the only men... and l have to deal with three hysterical females. You can always call me. Anytime. l suppose it would be pretty boring for Mom. l thought she was going there. Why is that? Then you could have some time together. The two of you. Would you like a drink? You're taking her, aren't you? Aren't you? No. l'll go alone, Elena. Why did we go to a pub? -Hilary?. -Hello, darling. You're going to be very disappointed, and l'm sorry. l don't think l'm going to be able to take you to the conference. Danny asked me and l had to tell him l was going alone. l had to promise, l can't lie to him. lf l start lying to the kids... -You see? -Yes, l see. Can't tell you how terrible it is l'm trapped in a nightmare. We can't go on like this, Felix. l'm not going to see you. Privately l mean, until you've made a decision. -You don't mean that. -lt's not fair to her either. -l'll call you from there. -Don't call me... or contact me, unless it's to tell me you're moving out. You gave him the elbow! Oh, brilliant! Tough is the only way to play. -Care to drink? -Yeah. -Robin? -Yeah? Can we have a chat at lunch time? Sure. -You still love her? -Of course, it's been 14 years. The last thing l want is for her to be hurt. She wouldn't be. Anyway, it's an impossible idea l've thought about it all night. There is no way she's going to have a casual relationship... or a one-night-stand. You don't know Elena! This wouldn't be a casual relationship. -What would it be? -A proper love affair. She'd get bored of me after a while, that's easily arranged... But at least she'd get her confidence back. lt sounds so cold-blooded. l look at it as a compassionate way out. She's gonna see that leaving you isn't the end of the world. -What will be in it for you? -There's gonna be expenses, but... Basically, l just see this as doing a favor for a friend. l've seen her picture, she's a beautiful woman. This isn't exactly gonna be a chore, you know. The whole thing is absurd. Maybe someday you'll be out there to pay the favor. She's definitely out. Dentist. l double-checked. Come on. That's Elena's cat. Show me the bedroom first. l wanna see her clothes. This way. She still thinks we have an ideal marriage. -l did too, in a way, until... -Till you met Hilary. l'm sorry. lt's just hard to keep secrets from actors... They just gossip the other parts, as Todd says. Her clothes are in this cupboard. There. This must be hidden from Elena. Always. Do you understand? And Hilary must never be told. lf she found out that would be it. She's a bit conservative. Old-fashioned, even. l'm gonna have to know all her interests... l wanna know her tastes in music, art... l want to know what restaurants she eats, where does she shop... -ls this her side of the bed? -Yes. Well, she likes classic music... Debussy and Dvorak. -This is one of her favorites. -Then put it on. -She's very romantic. -She's practical with the family. -ls this one of yours? -No, this is one of Elena's. She's a writer too? Well, she never finished anything. Maybe l'll have to read that later. For God's sake. The worst thing is... She's done nothing wrong. Nothing to deserve all this. She's been the perfect, classic wife, in fact. l'm sure l feel for her the same way l did on our wedding day. What am l gonna call you? How's Felix? You don't look like Felix. How about Albert? -Nice books. -Thanks. Shit! You jump away from the table, Audrey's drink spills... Todd and Rachel jump up, off and go fetch her pills. Can l talk to you after the rehearsal? lt's about the party tonight. l have to take Elena. -Both of you in the same room... -What are you saying? l couldn't handle it, l'm sorry. There can be a hint of tenderness. -l'll wipe the wine off her bosom. -Don't tap the bosom...the lap. l haven't had sex for 15 years! l'm screaming for it. You're a man of principle! Todd assured us he's working diligently on his character. All theatric people have a fling with the incestuous. Don't let them bore you. But do encourage them to gossip... and report back! Delvene you know. -And Liz, our casting consultant. -Nice to meet you. -l'll get you a drink. -That's a gorgeous necklace. -Thank you. -From you husband, am l right? -You're right. -An endangered species, husbands. lt's been so long since l had one, the word alone sets me off. l come all mushy and moody. You forget about the bad bits. l don't. l have nightmares about the bad bits. lt's the little things l miss. My last one was very good at giving small and costly gifts. He'd get them mail ordered and put them on my credit card. Surrender without struggle, to resist is futile. -l'm not resisting. -Do you hear that? l have the author's wife in my power to do with her what l will. -Shall l hold her to ransom? -lntroduce her to me, barbarian. This is lovely Elena, wife of Felix. Misterious and unknowable. This is the lovely and misterious Robin Grange, who plays David... How does he conceive these plots? Do you talk for hours in bed? -Oh no, it's not like that. -Of course not! That's not what do they at the bed time in the best regulated families. Felix is an observer. He's watching you right now, Todd... axing your lines as we speak. Todd, Robin! Come and meet our producer. The Almighty awaits. You have to excuse my friend. lt's nice meeting you. lt's nice to have met you. Even if he didn't take his weight on his elbows. l wouldn't mind if he left his socks on. How are you doing? l heard you got sick last night. -How was the party?. -lt was good. Nice to see Felix relaxed for a change. l met his wife. They were really going for her. -l'm glad you're feeling better. -Thanks. Elena? What a nice surprise. Somebody l know. Apart from the theather crowd, l don't know a soul in this town. -Did you enjoy it? -Very much. Me too. l came right from rehearsal. -So, are you alone? -Yes. Can l take you out for a cup of coffee? Yes, thank you. Music is my way of winding down. l'm a tough audience after rehearsal... the lines just roam around in your head. -Humphrey seems pleased. -That's good. Don't tell anyone, but with this play and that director... l don't think we can lose. So you're into theater? l did a bit of playwrighting once. And then you blew it marrying a playwright? -You haven't given up, have you? -l still do bits and pieces. Next time you write, don't give it to Felix, bring it to me. l haven't seen you around rehearsal lately. l don't think Felix likes me to, you know. He hasn't been there much, either. You should come sometime. lt's a lot of fun. lt's a madhouse... But it's a lot of fun. lt would be nice to see a different face. Nice for me. Felix? Come on in! l got a few minutes, l dropped the kids at their tennis lesson. -A cup of coffee or something? -No, thanks. -l said there would be expenses. -l see. You don't want some coffee? l could make some breakfast. l'm leaving town for three days... l thought it would be a good chance for you to see Elena. -When? -Next weekend. Playwright's Conference. You two kind of met the other night at the pub. Robin's told me all about you. Looking forward to see your play. Annabel's been doing some secretarial work for me lately. You shouldn't be leaving things like this lying around your desk. You shouldn't be pointing it to me. lt could be loaded. You are dangerous. -ls that thing real? -Why? You want to borrow it? What the fuck are you doing with one of these? Makes me feel butch. l'm gonna have to see Elena again before you leave. -You missed rehearsal. -l didn't come for that. Not this time. l'm waiting for Felix. -You look beautiful. -Thank you. -Where are you heading? -The new Stoppard play. Right, it's the big first night. Elena, l'm sorry. A snag's come up in act 2 and it's urgent. l have to work with Humphrey. l won't be able to make it. l'm sorry. ls it too late? Can you call someone else? -Well, it starts in half an hour. -l'll go. l mean, l am done here for the night. -Unless you have someone else. -l haven't. l've never seen a Stoppard play before and l've always wanted to. l've got a jacket over there. We can still make it in time. Do you mind? l'm sorry. l'll see you later. -We can fix this tomorrow. -l hate first nights anyway. -ls Elena going alone? -Robin is going with her. Let her deal with a handsome actor. -l think l'd better warn you. -What? l think l know why our friend left Hollywood. The word is, the head of the studio doing ''Frontline''... caught him in bed with his wife. He went berserk. Robin decided it might be a good idea to leave town for a while. My guess is everybody drinks this. But l refuse to go back there if l'm wrong. Robin is one of the leads in Felix's new play. What sort of role are you playing? Basically, l'm a hit man in a play about politics and morality... -lt will end up being about love. -Let's drink to that. l can make some mean expresso. But l bet Felix is waiting for you. l'd better get back. For the baby-sitter. Thank you for a great night. You know how to get out of here? Lock your door. A beautiful woman like you, out on your own. Don't worry. This is dear Old England, you know. You can never be too careful, Elena. Hello, Elena? lt's Robin Grange. l'm sorry about all this noise. There's a Finzi concert tomorrow in the Modern Series. -l thought you might want to go. -Oh yes, l would. l can't go today. We're in rehearsal. -l wanted to make sure you knew. -Thanks for the thought. Let's do a run through of your new lines to the front of the scene. You lot can break for lunch. Mind if l go over some scenes with Hilary? Away with you, young things. lf Theo reminds Audrey that Moshi is in the garden waiting... l think it makes the transition easier if she were first... Anyway, you don't need to hear it now. Sometimes you seem so cold it's like l don't even know you. Maybe you don't. Maybe there's nothing to know. -You live a charmed life. -Why? How many beautiful young actresses you know have an Oxford degree? lt didn't just fall into my lap, you know. Then out of Drama School into the hottest theater company in town.... That is pretty charmed to me. We were obviously fated. Fated to do what? After dinner, we go back to have a skip conference at my apartment. Stolen flowers, we could get some really cheap wine... knick-knack and make love watching some dirty videos. -You should be so lucky! -All right, no videos. -lsn't this out of your territory? -But it's the best bread in town... And l'm planning a private pic nic... being the first nice day around here in months. -What are you up to? -Shopping. Mainly for the children. -Felix is away. -Right, he's at the conference. So how come you're not rehearsing? Cause my co-star Hilary Rule has gone away for a couple of days... and nobody seems to know where. Listen, l'm tired of eating alone. Your kids are still in school, right? What do you say? Why not? This is to the first decent day in months! -l've looked for you everywhere! -l've been here waiting for you! -So you're ready? -Ready for what? Remember what we decided this morning. Ready for what? For me to drive you home... slowly. l can't let you in. Why? Have your friends have me vetoed or something? Enough already. Todd! Delvene! This is good. -How was the conference? -Hell. That's too bad. l had a great weekend. Here's a copy of all my expenses. l don't mind taxes returned. So, are you going to the Drama Awards? Yes, l'm presenting one. You're not getting cold feet, are you? -You can pull out. lt's not late. -You were spying on me! Henry always takes down the car numbers that parked outside. Well, you needn't worry. My virtue is still intact. lt's very good. Pace is just right. Humphrey Beale, Felix Webb. The old team back in action. And for the OTC. Tell me something about this new project. Humphrey has this constant feel that theater is entertainment. l've been looking for you. Let's get out of here. ...the intelectual respectability beloved of the Olivier Committee. But this is a very controversial subject. What kind of audience reaction you're expecting? Well, awestruck, l hope. We're free. We've escaped. -Don't you hate these events? -Yes! Everybody's always looking over your shoulder to see... if there's someone more important they should be talking to. -Right? -Of course. And Felix gets invited to so many of them these days. At least you get some time together at home. Not really, no. He's a workaholic. Goes from one play to the next. He's doing a screenplay for Paramount, after this. -What's it called? -''Sound and Fury''. Can l tell you something? The only reason l came here today was to see you. You're gonna have to ask us to leave, right? Luncheon is served, sir. Do you mind what l said? No, but Felix must be waiting for me. l'd better go back on my own. l'm not used to drinking in the afternoon. -lt's awful, isn't it? -l rather enjoyed it. lt's for me. Hello? Mom, it's for you. -lt's me. How are you doing? -Hello, l'm fine. Listen, do you want to have dinner with me tomorrow? Well, l'm not sure when l... You know... -l'll call back at a better time. -All right. Thank you. Bye. ls Hilary there? lt's Robin Grange. That was Jean Deacon. You know Jean. She wants me to go out with her tomorrow evening. Her husband is away, he's on business. You should have said yes. l didn't know if l... Maybe l will. That was great. We have gone through everything, haven't we? Not quite everything. l'm afraid that's not allowed. -We're two of a kind. -We're completely different. -Complementary. -Opposite. -Opposites attract. -Opposites repel. Leave it. -Hello? -Hilary? lt's you. -What was that? -Nothing. -Were you asleep? -We're not talking, remember?. -Please, stop it. -What's wrong? lt's just Serena. She's being a pain. l can't bear not being able to see you. -We've been through all this. -You sound as if you don't care. -Of course l do. -l'm definitely moving out. -When? -As soon as the play opens. -Listen, l should go. -Why? -You know why. Serena, l'm coming! -You haven't answered. Let me think about it and l'll tell you tomorrow. l guess that wasn't your agent. You had a narrow escape. l was about to kick you in the balls. Funny how your stuff's grown in the play. You're more than Delvene now. Felix and that script. He just can't let go. l guess it's a lot like his marriage. lt's his security blanket. -Do you know Elena? -No. -l do. -Do you? l take her out a bit. -How is she like? -Everyone loves her. She's a little crazy right now, but... these long relationships all have their ups and downs... They're in a down right now, but l'm sure they'll pull through. Look at me. lt's all right. All right. -l'm in love with someone. -The phantom caller. l shouldn't have let things go so far. lt was fun. You are very beautiful. -And you're very dangerous. -You are. l like playing with matches. -There's something l gotta know. -What? You prefer like this... or like that? Nice. No, l... Robin, please go. Next time. Oh, God. l came this way on purpose, but l wanted you to see my place. l'd like to. -Say hi to sleepy Albert. -How do you do, Albert? You're lovely. What happens to you when your master goes back to America? l'm not going back. How about l fix us some drinks? You want to pick a record? Wait here, Albert. lt's my favorite music. We're two of a kind, you and l. We find the same things important. -We're both exiles. -Exiles... -How did you and Felix meet? -ln Rome, at a writers conference. He just had his first play produced. You are a lot prettier than him. And a whole lot nicer than me. lt's true. lt's about time we got in the subject of you. lt's not easy because you always try to avoid it. Elena, l know about Felix and Hilary Rule. l've got to work with her everyday. They're not the most discreet of lovers. lt's this open secret. Now that l've got to know you... lt's just so unbelievable. lt's late. You're tired. Let me take you home. -l'll get a taxi. -l'm not letting you go alone. Did you know it's common knowledge about you and Hilary Rule? lt must be hard for her, everyone knowing why she was cast. l know this is awkward, but can you make it today, lunchtime? -One o'clock? Yes. Good. Bye. These things are so real. They're exactly the same way as mine. -l tried calling you Tuesday night. -You did. -l mustn't have let my machine on. -Where were you? Somewhere as good as home. You've got a visitor. l had to see you. l'm breaking my own rules, aren't l? l've missed you. l've been going crazy. Me too. You don't know how crazy l've been. -Careful. -What's that? After you had gone, l had to do something. Did Serena get that part she went for? That's a drag. l know how much she wanted it. Be sure to tell her l said ''Hang in there'', ok? -You didn't say he'd been around. -Didn't l? -We had a retrieve. -Tuesday night, was it? l bet he tried, the bastard. -Did he? -Oh, Felix... Actually, he told me he knows Elena. -What did he say? -He takes her out a bit. He likes her a lot. l'm not needed until four o'clock. All yours, Grange. ls anybody here? The doors are locked. Everybody's gone. -lt's just the two of us. -Robin? You're not an actor, you're a magician. That's what actors are. We're weavers of spells. lt's scary being on stage. l want you to help me rehearse my toughest scene. What was she doing there? She was meeting someone. -Robin, it must be him. -l guess. -Are you pleased? -ln a way. Wouldn't it help if there were something going on with him? -What happened when he came here? -What do you mean? l told you, it was just work. We went through the script. -He moved in on you, didn't he? -lf we don't trust each other... lt's him l don't trust. Don't lay it on me, because l can't deal with it right now. l'm desperate to interview your father... but there's something else l want more. What is that? You. You see... l wasn't raised on love. Love was never mentioned. lt didn't exist. And when it hit me, it was like l was a stranger in my land. l don't know what l'm doing anymore. lt's all right. lt's ok. We'd better go. When are they coming back? We still have ten minutes. l hate the thought of you being married. l'm not even jealous. Well, you needn't be. You still love Felix? Yes. l have loved him. l have loved him very much. But... l don't know. Something's happened. You got me, that's what happened. l need to see you everyday. l don't mind you care for Felix. That's a lie. l still care and a lot. Right. l want to give you fair warning. l want you for me. lt's gonna have to be your choice. l'm willing to wait. -Where are you going tonight? -To see a play. -The essay is great. -Thanks. -What play is it? -An Oscar Wilde. -You look really good. -Thank you. So, what are you doing, Miss Kasparov. -Move the knight. -You're so annoying. -You'll lose the rook. -l'm off now. How long has the casserole been in? -Almost an hour. -Half an hour more should do. -What time will you be back? -You'll be asleep. But l'll kiss you goodnight. Bye, Danny. -Why aren't you going, daddy? -l have to work. -Who's she going with? -Just a friend. -Man or woman? -You're so 'naif sometimes. -lt's naive. -Now listen, you three. lt's a long time since your mother had an opportunity to go out. Now you're older, she can. Poor Daddy. ls it awful for you? lt's good for people to have some space. l'm not naive, am l? No, darling. You're not naive. -Sorry, l'm late. -What's the matter? l'll be all right. Shouldn't we go? lt'll start soon. We got a minute. Come on here. l want to show you something. Ladies and gentlemen... can l present you the author of the play we're about to read? This is Elena Webb. lt is very important that a writer sees her work performed. Quickly, it's Daddy! Breakfast? Wonderful! You're all sweaten. And you haven't shaved. Never on Sundays! Coffee. No, dad. Come and have it upstairs with mom. -Come on, we made it especially. -For both of you. -Mommy, wake up. -Breakfast is served. All right. You overslept and Danny's friends are coming to lunch. -Put it on the chair. -Sit here, daddy. -Come on, you two. -Aren't you staying to talk to us? We've got stuff to do. That's the worst part, isn't it? But they know we both love them. They're old enough to understand if it's explained to them. -l've got some explaining to do. -l think l guessed. Something extraordinary has happened, Felix. Something that 2 months ago l thought it was impossible. And you know him. That's strange too. lt's Robin Grange, the actor. Did you guess? l wasn't sure. lt's unbelievable! That the same thing should've happened to me... Are you really happy? l can understand now you and Hilary. l never thought l would. You haven't known him long. Felix, l didn't do this on the rebound or to make you jealous. lt just happened. You can leave, Felix... and start a new home with Hilary. Robin's talking about getting married. -What? -Don't worry. lt's still too early to learn if it's going to last, l know that. He can come here sometimes when the children have got to know him. He'd never be a substitute father. No one's managed an assassination attempt over ten years. Excuse me, Robin. Do you mind if l do this last bit sitting down. l think it will be less melodramatic. You could try. We don't want the stage littered with bodies. Take a little bit further back. There's a gun pointing at your head. lf you shoot me... you will be killed. l see no point in that. lt works. You forgot your watch. Can l ask you something? Why did you change the ending and have David killed? l think he would get his justice served. People like him always get away with things. -You don't like him, do you? -No, not much. Although l know he's a great friend of yours. He's good to work with. Anyway, you casted him. l never thought of you as a merited actress. You're in some sort of off stage relationship with him too. -You know what l think? -What? You resent him being with Elena. He's so transparent! l don't know why you encourage him. l'll stop speaking to him if that's what you want. -ls it? -l don't know what l want. Dogs are taken for walks. Perhaps that's what l have become. A dog. Lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue. Lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue. Audacious intents now. 58 to 1 for England. Middle of the afternoon session on a long, long way... from that West lndian in a total of 492. Robin. You've been avoiding me. l'm having withdrawal symptons. -Please. -You are too, admit it. Get out of here. We're only a minute. -l just came by to wish you luck. -l'm gonna need it. l've never been so nervous in all my life. -You're gonna be great! -How are you feeling? Actually, l'm feeling pretty weird. -How so? -l think l'm in love. -Rubbish! -l wouldn't lie, baby. -Remember, we're two of a kind. -Opposites. -Opposites attract. -Opposites repel. lt's not even you, silly! -lt's Elena Webb. -Are you serious? Never been more serious in my whole life. That's wonderful. Really. l'm visiting with my co-star. And l'm outta here. Felix, what are you doing? l'll see you later. Good luck for tonight. -What was all that about? -lt looks like a lovers' tiff. Beginners on stage, please. Step forward, please. Ready to slide curtains. Sometimes you're so cold it's like l don't even know you! Maybe not. Maybe there's nothing to know. Why do you treat me like that? You keep shutting me out. Why do you want to get it all of me? There are things you shouldn't know. Did you think of that? All l want to know is how you're feeling. ls it too much to ask? -You know how l feel! -No, l don't! How should l, if you don't even say if you love me! l wasn't raised on love. Love was never mentioned to me. Love didn't exist! And when it did, it was like a stranger in my own head! l don't know what l'm doing anymore! So who am l dealing with here? An impostor?. l have a good thing with you. Why would l blow my chances by blowing my cover?. You sound like a spy. l always loved those kind of stories. -Actually, we're very different. -We're complementary. -Opposites. -Opposites attract. They also repel. Miss Rule, this is your call. Are you ready for your walk, Audrey?. l haven't walked for 15 years, my dear, as you well know. -She's in a bad mood, l'm afraid. -64, go. -She's got a bitter nature. -Dogs are taken for walks... -l think l have become one. -What do you prefer me to use? A roll, perhaps? Take me for a rock and roll... l was a very good dancer once. So was Theo. l've seen the pictures. Perhaps you should take him to the ball of the new year. l think it's a mistake. lt sets a precedent. This time, my girl, l don't agree. l've survived over the dedication. Seeing him will show l trust her judgement. l will worry for you. So to sum up, man must transcend his war like instincts. Abandon the ancient pursuit of moral ends by imoral means. The energy and resources thus released will able our species... -Oh, God. -to evolve. But this requires a leadership of an exceptional kind. lt also requires a ruthless intolerance of subversion... and terrorrism. No one's managed an assassination attempt in over 10 years. l must warn you l've activated the alarm already... and there's a gun pointed at your head... lf you shoot me, you will be killed. l see no point in that. No! You mustn't feel too bad. ln the conflict between idealism and love... it is only appropriate that idealism should triumph. -Are you all right? -What the fuck. l'm fine! Author! What the hell was all that about? The whole thing was a little bit strained for him, you know. lt's the start of a new play. He's allowed to few nuts. -There he is! -How are you, boy? -Truly wonderful! -Congratulations! lt was fabulous. Found it very promising. Describes him as a serious psycopath. Felix, it was positively ruling! My sister saw Antonio Harman Jones... Felix, it was so good l cried. My father said it is gonna be a classic. You were right about changin g the finish. Congratulations! lt's good, Felix. lt's your best. Are you all right? He's an actor. He'll have to go away. Well, then l'll have to find another lover! -Excellent. -Felix, it was brilliant. You'd better go in there. She's a bit overwhelmed. Excuse me. Hollywood's loss is London's gain. Robin Grange, who is gorgeous... blew this audience members' socks and mobbed sky high. lt's all turning out perfectly, isn't it? -What? -Conveniently for us. Don't you think? l think it's about time you two are formerly introduced. Hilary Rule, Elena Webb. -You were very good. -Thank you. Something strange happened tonight. Some schmuck got into my dressing room and stole my gun. lt was the one from my last movie that Marty gave me as a souvenir. lt's a dummy gun, it's got dummy bullets... -But still. -You'd better tell security. Anyway, l'd like to make a toast... Ladies and gentlemen, can l have your attention, please? l need to make a toast. To a man who l think l can safely call one of my closest friends. To a man who's mainly responsible for this evening success... To Felix Webb. Something else l'd like to say on a personal note. There's something l feel that l need to share. Felix's been comissioned by Paramount to write a new movie... and tonight he promised me the lead. l want to tell you, in front of these handful of witnesses. You try to renegate this promise there's gonna be hell to pay. All right, enough of the hype. Now for the really big stuff. Elena's been writing a play of her own for the last few years. Robin gave it to the director of Royal Court. lt's been accepted. -That's fantastic. -lt's wonderful. -Who's the director? -We'll talk about it. There's a role in it for me too, if it's ok with the author. You don't mean the son? Robin, you always think you can play everyone... You're completely wrong for it. l mean, he needs to be really powerfully built, rough... and l know the actor for it. Sorry. Tom Ford for ''A Night in Wyoming''. -Hurry up, you're missing it! -Get your ass into gear! l'm coming. l'm coming. Peter Williams for ''The Legend of Johnny War''. Robin Grange for ''Sound and Fury''. There's mommy! John Frances for ''Painting with Light''. And the winner is... Robin Grange for ''Sound and Fury''. -Felix! -Yes. -He won. -Right. -Congratulations. -Thanks.
