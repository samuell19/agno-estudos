See you later, love. Good luck. Thank you. Okay okay. Now if I have to throw out any more soggy cereal, I'm having you skinned and turned into bongo drums. [ Knocks on door ] I'm sorry, Mrs. Sinclair, but I warned you last week. Well, I'm sorry too. I filed my feet flat on these city sidewalks and I can't find another place. There's nothing we can do about that. Look look. Will you just look at this? This is my receipt. I paid my rent. Look, I told you, lady, this has got nothing to do with paying the rent. This building's been condemned. I'm not going. Well, I am sorry. Come on, let's go. You can't do that. You start over there. Bob, give me a hand over here. You can't-- man: I'll get the chairs out of the kitchen. I ain't going. Kids, everyone sit down on grandma's hope chest, all of you. Christina, hand me my purse. Come on, honey. Come on, mama needs you. Here, I want you to take this and this and I want you to go call Mitch and tell him what's happening. Come on now, hurry up. Where did you get all this money? Worked for it. We're here to call you on your promise. What promise? Last year you said that if we could raise the money to fix it up you'd get the city to loan us a building-- one for the people that have been evicted. No, I believe I said I'd try. Now we are doing a study-- come on, it's too late for a study. It's October already. Winter's coming. Look, this city controls hundreds of buildings that landlords have abandoned. These people-- they're not moving into the Watergate. And they're not moving into the city property until my staff and I can be sure of the ramifications. What ramifications? You've got empty buildings. We've got people that need them. We're offering you a solution on a silver platter. Look, we'll operate it. We'll even pay the utilities. Hell, we're doing your job for you. Or don't you care? It's not a question of caring. My job, my responsibility is to the property of the citizens of Washington. What about the citizens of Washington who have no property? Don't you also have a responsibility to them? I told you we're doing a study. Now the city already has two family shelters available. And they're both full! There are 2000 forced evictions every year. Are you sure of your figures? Yes! I checked with the marshal's office. [ Phone rings ] Hold on for a minute. Dudney here. Hold on. Mitch, it's for you. Thank you. Hello. Hi, Mary Ellen. What's up? Next up, "Washington post." You want some advice? Don't. Now I told you I was gonna help you and I will, but you're not helping me or yourself by trying to make us look bad. All right, I got it. You call the press. We're on our way. Now that was about a neighbor of ours, ida sinclair. She's not being evicted. She's just being thrown out in the street with six kids. You can come with us or catch it on the 6:00 news. Watch her hitting that banister. [ Ida whimpering ] I'm warning you, lady-- making us lug you. We ain't lugging that couch down too. Officer, I find it hard to believe that you can't just-- [ car horn honks ] Hi, Carol. Where's ida? - She's still inside. - What about the kids? I sent them next door. I didn't want them to see any of this. Excuse me, fellows. Excuse me. Hey, put her down, will you, fellows? It's all right, ida. It's all right, sweetheart. Ida, oh, hon. It's all right. Man: Hey, watch out down there. [ Shouting ] Oh, no, that's my couch, you creeps. My couch, you creeps. Mitch: It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Let it go, hon. I'm Max gunning, w.X.D.C. News. This is ida sinclair. - Who are you? - I'm Mitch snyder. Why are you being evicted, Mrs. Sinclair? Give her a minute, will you, please? Why are you being evicted, Mrs. Sinclair? It's not my fault. I paid my rent. It's not my fault. I have four kids in the hospital. They got lead poisoning from the walls it's not my fault. Fix the walls. You just tell me, Mr. Mayor, where's a woman with 10 babies supposed to go? Fix the walls. Will you excuse us? Thanks for coming. Come on, sweetheart. We'll go over to euclid house. Excuse me, who are you people? We're the c.C.N.V. Are you some kind of lobbyists? We serve soup, not Caesar. Could you tell me a little about these people, please? Well, Harold was a nuclear chemist for 10 years. I was a housewife. And Mitch was a businessman on Madison Avenue. No no, the c.C-- what is it? It's c.C.N.V. It's the community for creative non-violence, a kind of non-sectarian kibbutz. Some kind of antiwar group? You could say that. Gandhi said poverty was the worst form of violence. This is another of the more than 2000 evictions that are taking place in the city of Washington this year. And yet for the small band of zealots, the members of the c.C.N.V., ida sinclair and her children would not have a place to call home tonight. The small community of activists fighting a private war against poverty is all that stands between ida sinclair and the cold streets. This is Max gunning, w.X.D.C. Evening news. Carol: Okay, be careful now. Head up the stairs and turn right. I sure hope I didn't start something that ain't got a finish. Listen to me. Ida. After what's happened to you, you've got a right to start something. How about an egg salad sandwich? Six years I've been on that housing waiting list. I don't want to get kicked back down to the bottom. If they even try we'll-- you'll what? You'll be fine. You're young and you're healthy. You haven't got anything to lose. But me-- I've been scrubbing hospital floors for 22 years. I'm worn out. I don't bounce back. Don't worry, ida. We'll find you a place. Honey, don't make promises you can't keep. You don't know how bad it's got. The city's crawling with people just like me, people being thrown away. What did dudney say? He says we have to wait in line. If we could just get our hands on a building, we could do the work ourselves. I say we go back down there. I say we go back and sit outside the dude's office and we don't leave until we get his attention. We make signs. We make more magic with the Max gunnings of the world. I can't believe he wouldn't respond if he knew what was happening. And we're not gonna get anywhere unless we appeal to him as a person. He's not a person. He's a bureaucrat. Bureaucrats are people. We gotta work on his heart. Harold, supposing you and I moved into that park near his office without any press or anything else, just us and him, people to people? Mitch, it's cold out there, man. We'll freeze. That's the whole point. Well, fine. If it will make him see, I'm all for it. Good deal. Carol, please call him and tell him we intend to stay there day and night till we get a building. He's got a conscience. Hey, Mitch. What's this? Long Johns. You're gonna need 'em. Thanks. [ Singing ] [ Stops singing ] [ Rat squeaking ] Those damn rats. I'm gonna get it. I'm gonna get it. [ Distant siren wailing ] Let's do it. Come on. [ Boys whispering ] Come on, spread it around. Come on, spread it. [ Laughing ] Get away, get away, get away, get away. Get away, get away, get away. Troll busters. I thought they only went to the bridge, but I guess we're getting more popular. Who are you? - Who is me? - Yeah. My name Muriel. - Oh, I'm Harold. - Mm-hmm. I'm Mitch. Hey, thanks a lot for helping us. Mm-hmm, troll busting-- you know what that is? It's a new stunt the fraternity got, eh? They set the street folk on fire and they watch them hop. Oh, that makes me damn mad to see them picking on street folk. And when you try to steal me buggy, I don't want nobody to touch my stuff, eh? You see this buggy? I paid $2 for it. And even when I sleep, look here-- you see this? They can't get it. And if they try I go right for the eye. Mm-hmm, it got soap water in it, you know. You must buy the generic kind, eh? It's as good as the name brand - and it's cheaper. - Really? You have food in there? Yeah, sandwiches. Here, why don't you have one? No no, I done had my dinner already. Take one for later. No, I said I had my dinner. But you pups is green, eh? You mustn't keep food where you're sleeping. The rats will get it. And when you finish eating you must wash off your mouth good and your hands too. Otherwise they'll get you. They just will nibble your lip right off. Look here. I was aiming at one when those snakes snuck up. One what? The rat. I was aiming at the rat when the snakes snuck up. You mean, a rat near us? Mm-hmm. And listen to me. You're gonna freeze your tuches off if you don't get some cardboard or a heating grate to sleep on. And you must wrap up yourself in plastic, eh? It keep you warm. You better start thinking out here, you know. Out here is not for the dumb. When you move out in the street you becomes an invisible man. Who can help a stinking old soul when they have the underwear ads and the shops for designer ice cream to look at? Hmm? I go, see. Take care. - Hey, thanks again. - Take care. So young, so young, so young. Look at that. Yeah, someone's here at the ellipse. We're gonna need the coroner over here. Old Esther Gore has finally cashed it in. Man over radio: 10-4. We'll get you an ambulance and some assistance. You knew her? She was practically a landmark, lived here for years, ever since they let her out of some institution. All of us beat guys tried to get her to go inside. No way. Looks like she froze to death. It's too bad somebody didn't give her a blanket when she could have used one. Eh, where are your manners in the trees? Come give me a hand. Hey, Muriel. Mm-hmm. Come over here and sit down. I got the buggy. I buy two of these, you know. I hide the other one with my buggy in the secretary of treasury's garage. Listen, the French embassy, you see-- the French embassy-- they is having a sale. You know, they're buying new fridges and I was first in line for two of these. Can you imagine those movers? They sell me these boxes-- old Muriel-- - for $7 apiece. - $7? You can pay me when you get it, eh? No no, we got it. Harold's our banker. You have the money? Yeah. How much did you say? $7. Here you go. What is this? $10. $10. I have to give you change. No, you keep the change. Oh, no no. Muriel don't-- I don't mind you see where I got it. You're my friends, both of you, eh? But Muriel don't take and she don't get taken. I pay $7-- you pay $7. Here's your change-- $2. Besides, officer summers tell me you're taking care of me pal Esther. You're claiming she ashes, yes. Yes, ma'am. Mm-hmm. Thanks. Esther was crazy, you know. Oh, my, she was crazy, but good. But you see what I mean? You have to have something to sleep in, hmm? If you don't get the frostbite, it bites you. Look here, you know, I have some crayons. You paint it all pretty outside, make it look nice-- I mean, if you like. I like. Thank you very much. Come, son, you help me get the other box, eh? And listen, you take care of me buggy, eh? I don't want nobody touching me stuff. Oh, nobody will touch it, I promise. All right. Go on, see. It's over here. Oh. Hey. Hello. Boy, do you smell gamey. I wonder why. - Where's Harold? - He's taking a bath at that gas station down the block. They're nice people. They let street folks use the radiator hose. What do you got there? Oh, wool socks. Thank you. My feet are freezing. Come over here. Sit down. I would have been here sooner, but we had 40 people for lunch. I wish I knew where they were all coming from. Institutions. Nearly half these people are mentally ill. We used to keep them in places where they were cared for, but since the courts changed the law they've been dumped out on the streets to protect their civil rights and save us a few bucks. The other half are alcoholics or veterans or unemployed or just plain poor people like ida sinclair. The temperature's supposed to drop tonight. So I hear. I was thinking that once we see dudney leave, why don't you come home and get warm? You can come back here first thing in the morning before he gets to work. I told you I'm not leaving till we get a building. You're not leaving. You're just getting warm for a while. You know, ida was right. We don't know the half of what's going on out here. We don't know a 10th. This is where the homeless live day and night. We're sitting in their living room right now. We're not gonna learn how to help them by running back to a warm shelter as soon as it gets dark. We won't help anybody if you get sick or freeze. You're in no physical condition. You're half-blind. Your doctor won't even vouch for your heart. My heart is sick from what I'm seeing out here. I got news for you, mahatma-- sitting on a sidewalk and freezing to death ain't gonna fix that. I'm not leaving. Mitch, please. I can't stand by and watch you do this. Nobody's asking you to. One frozen activist, a two-inch column in "the post." Who'll care? Nobody. If you keep pushing me you're gonna push me right out of your life. You gotta do what you gotta do, Carol. Damn you. This is a relationship-- two in one, remember? Yes! And we both have individual responsibilities. I'm sorry. I can come back later. No no no, it's all right. - Mr. Dudney, this is Carol fennely. - Hi. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind coming up to the office if it's convenient. What, now? Yeah. Sure. You'd better wait here for Harold. Try and stay warm. So what about a shelter? I got Mrs. Sinclair and her children an apartment. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. I know she'll appreciate that. Now what about a shelter for the homeless? Look, I made some calls. The city's already providing over 400 beds for the homeless. I made some calls too and my figures say it's a lot less. But most of those are empty. I don't know who told you that, but I know you're smart enough not to believe it. All you gotta do is look out the window and count the people in that park. Look, my job-- my job is to manage city property, not to manage the homeless. What do you want from me? You know what I want. That's why you have me up here. Okay. Who was-- who was that guy? Esther Gore I know about, but-- his name is written on the side of one of those boxes. Bill crowhurst. He was a homeless man living on a heating grate in a triangle on Pennsylvania Avenue. A bus made too wide a turn and ran over him. Mitch, I would really like to help you. It's just I don't know what to do. Yes, you do. Give us a shelter. I can't do that. I'd lose my job. No, you wouldn't. You're a public servant. Exactly. I am paid to manage city property. I'm just another cog in the wheel of the bureaucracy. You're the bureaucracy. I'm the bureaucracy. Every man, woman and child on this planet is the bureaucracy. We're hypnotized and immobilized by it, but bureaucracy is nothing more than the name of a system that stops us from being human beings. You are better than that system. He's been in there a long time. There he is. Come on. We didn't get it, right? What? What? We got a building. [ Laughing ] What did you look so sad for? This is great. I want to thank you for coming over to help us. Oh, shoot. The way I figure it, that dudney person would have done nothing to help me find an apartment if it hadn't been for you people. The very least I can do is help you fix up your shelter. Mitch, you're sitting on the wallpaper. Oh, no wonder I was so uncomfortable. You shouldn't have done it without telling us. I don't know, it sounds like ida got a pretty good place out of it. I'm talking about the windows. Well, you can't have a warm building with broken windows. That's not the point. You spent all of our money. How are we gonna pay for everything else? What else do we need? Nail, shingles, lumber, plumbing, electric wire... Food. We had 60 people for lunch yesterday. Where are we gonna find the money to keep feeding the people that show up at our back door? What I want to know is, where are all those people sleeping? What if we asked the churches? - Ask 'em what? - To open their doors and let us use 'em as temporary shelters, at least until we get this place finished. Finished? How are we gonna finish it when you spent all our money on the windows? Why don't we make up some baked potatoes and tea? At least we can take it out to warm up the people if we can't give them the roof. By the way, you guys are doing a terrific job. Don't let me get in your way. You know what I mean? Get in our way? Hi, we're from the c.C.N.V. We got some baked potatoes and some hot tea for you if you like. Got any heat? Well, sure, if you don't mind crashing on our floor. He doesn't mean "heat." He means heat, vino, moonshine. Oh, no, I'm sorry. We got none of that. You should have stewed these potatoes, not baked them. Here. You can help yourself out of here. And take this garbage and that brown water with you before I force it right through your kidneys the hard way. C.e.t.a., H.U.D., c.c.n.v.-- you're a bunch of slimy, skimming government pigs. I can spell you all out four ways in four letters. The c.C.N.V. Is the community for creative non-violence. We're not a government agency. We're just trying to help and this is the best we could do. I'm sorry to have bothered you. Let's go. Hey, you. What's your name? Mitch. You can call me potato face. Hey, there's an old man out there. He's sick. If you're for real you can help him. Come on. Thank you. Lord, if they could just see what I see, be what I've been, I'd give it to 'em. Excuse me, sir. Don't be frightened. We just want to help. Don't take me to the hospital, not there. Last time at the hospital they made me so scared I almost messed on myself. Why don't you come to our place? What you got there? Some hospitality. You can get warm and we can change that bandage. It's okay. We won't hurt you. I'm Mitch. That's Carol. Hi. [ Groans ] As long as it ain't the hospital. Don't worry. Come on, I'll give you a hand. Up you go. That's it. "Feed my little lambs," Jesus always be saying. Watch your footing. - Woolly white keeps them warm. - That's it. Another one. - Keeps them snug. - One more. That's it. One last one. You got it. Our car's right over there, see? Come on, you got it made. - So what's your name? - Reverend St. keys. Take it easy. You promised. Now you're just gonna change the bandage, right? Did they give you anything for this at the hospital, reverend? "Stay off your feet. Be sure not to remain outside at night." And get this-- they list him with no fixed address. Living on the street you get feathers in your ears. That's what I told them. Told whom? The white coats. I told 'em, "I'm not schizo, and neither am I." They put me away, said living on the streets was crazy. Then a new man come and let us all out. And you know what I say? Nuts. You sound like a pretty smart fellow to me. Well, I may be crazy, but I ain't stupid. Mitch. Excuse us a minute, please. - What? - We've got to get him to a doctor. We promised we wouldn't. I know, but I think he's got gangrene. When I was changing his bandage his big toe came off. Oh, dear god. We'll take him right away. - What time is it? - Late. Woman over P.A.: Dr. Hefron to icu, please. Dr. Hefron to icu. Couldn't we at least get him a bed? We've been here for over two hours. Kamp-- Chris kamp. Do you have your insurance number? Good. Go right in there. We were here long before him. I told you all the rooms are full. I know what's going on here. It's hands-off time. Now is it because he doesn't have any insurance or is it because he needs a bath? What if he was your father? Where do you think you're going? To find a doctor. This is a hospital, isn't it? Don't trouble yourself, ma'am. I know you're busy. I'm sorry. There isn't any more. I'm sorry. Man: And if we're lucky, kids, and if the law does what I think it will do, there'll be no school for you. So what's the bottom line? Ain't gonna be no school if they don't learn the golden rule, 'cause earthquake, wind and fire is gonna blow this world sky high, no lie. We're calling all the churches in Washington. We're building a shelter, but it's not finished yet. If we could just get a few churches to open their doors-- I'm sure you are doing plenty, but we all could do more. No no, for the homeless. Vagrants are just people who-- never mind. Good morning. I got 70 people fed. 20 more showed up and we ran out of food. Excuse me, did anybody find Muriel? Harold's still looking for her. - Did you vote? - Yeah. Well, she's a survivor. You gotta look on the bright side, right? I've been calling all week every single church, synagogue and mosque in the yellow pages. Two have agreed to open their doors. That's the bright side. How are we gonna feed all these people breakfast tomorrow? Day by day the manna fell. There's your answer. I'm gonna look for Muriel. Oh, Mitch, check the morgue. It was in the paper-- three more people froze to death. Good evening, reverend. Keeping watch over your flock by night? Did you find her? No. And he shall give his angels charge over thee lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. That's a sign. You saved my foot when they was gonna chop it off. Good. Maybe you can use it to kick an angel for me-- one that delivers groceries. Oh, by the way, I've been meaning to ask you why you wear those keys around your neck. That's my hobby. Didn't you never had no hobby? [ Laughs ] See you in the morning. Hey, Mitch, somebody's at the door. Coming. Hi. My name's Andrew-- Andrew Jackson. No relation. You Mitch snyder? Yeah, come in. Ida sinclair told me you could use some help. My pickup's out back. It's full of food. I can fill it up every day if you like. And it's all yours. Field goal! Hey, Brussels sprouts. I didn't know they still made these. And so many. This is nothing. The garbage at the gourmet shop-- now that's some serious food. I've been feeding my kids on gourmet-store-food trash for over a year now. Hey, you, what the hell do you think you're doing? This ain't no restaurant. We're just taking the garbage. No, you're not. Hey hey, come on. Oh, okay, take it easy. We're out of here. I don't want to see you around here again. Carol. Carol. Could you hand me that pot? A lot of the food's good, but if a can's dented or the veggies look a little tired, stores can't sell it. Then they ought to be glad that we're taking it off their hands. They should be. They give it away and they get a big tax break for it. Some stores have programs for it. But others-- they think it's dangerous-- something about insurance problems. And since technically it's their food till it hits the garbage trucks-- see, technically we're stealing. Yeah, but if we told the stores what's going on, if they knew that people are actually going hungry-- wait wait wait. Bottom of the ninth. The old team is out. [ Cheering ] The election results. We're hoping this new mayor has his eyes open to what's going on in this town. Mitch, I think you'd better come with me. I think you all better come with me. Carol. Excuse me. Our shelter-- they tore down our shelter. How? Why? Why did they do this? What difference does it make? They did it. I guess they really decided to get tough with us. What a vicious, spiteful thing to do. What are we gonna do now? Where are we gonna put all those people? Here. Hey. Sorry, fellows. We're only doing our job. Okay, you fellows move along now. They don't want you here. Where do they want us? Come on, let's go. Muriel: Smart boy. Keep your head warm. Keep your body light. Muriel, where the hell have you been? We've been looking all over for you. The d.A. Had a wingding and miss aster asked me to be decoration on top of the cake. - [ Both laugh ] - Good to see you. Step into my office. Oh, yes, it looks very warm here. It is warm. I also bring some tea. Good deal. You know, I went to the post office to pick up a check and then I went to the hotel. When I get me social security check, see, those posters look damn good to me. Thank you. Expensive, eh? $23 a night, the damn thief. They got you by the naughties. What? They got you by the naughties. How we used to pay first month's rent and last month's rent, eh? We don't have it. I heard they knocked your house down. I'm sorry. Oh, no no, not my house. It was yours. We were fixing it up for the homeless. Well, that's the second time then. What do you mean? I had my beauty parlor in my house for 42 years. Then along come the road workers. Progress they call it. They knock it down. It wasn't much, an old shop, but it was mine, eh? They never did build the damn road. Hey, you'd better get moving. It's clean sweep time. What do you mean? They're covering up the grates. When the neighborhood gets too crowded there's too many of us hanging out, they lock up the heaters. The birds of the air have nests. The foxes have holes. But a son of mine have no place to lay his head. Where to now? I know. Give me a hand. All right. There you go. Help me with this stuff. Well, this is a federal office. It seems to me that your business is with the city. That's like playing one-man ping-pong. There's no time for games. It's winter now. People are freezing. They need a roof, any roof. We want the national visitors' center. Well, why think so small? Why not ask for the Pentagon? Come on, you and I both know that center's nothing but a big white elephant. This office is not about to turn over a multimillion-dollar investment to a bunch of street people. An investment that's totally wasted. If you ask me, that center is nothing but an empty train station with locks on the doors. Just give us one of the side rooms. At least it'll get some use. It's warm. It's accessible, logical-- it is not a federal problem. What if it were your parents out there? As I said, it's not a federal problem. I'm sorry. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a luncheon. I think you ought to know we plan on moving in whether you give us your approval or not. Then you and your homeless people run the risk of being arrested. Fine. At least in jail they won't freeze to death. Sad, isn't it, that in this incredibly rich country that's what it takes? What the hell is this? We can't stay here. My friend Carol is meeting with a very powerful lady in this agency, trying to get them to give us a shelter. Give us? What's in this for you? One thing you learn out here is that everybody's out to get something. I don't know what you're out to get, but I'm watching you, boy. Take it easy, will you? Here she comes. Carol. - How did we do? - It was a total head-on collision. We gotta think up a new strategy. - Is she still there? - Yeah. All right, fine. We're all going in to see her together. Mitch. Diane fisk, Mitch snyder. - How do you do, ma'am? - Hello. Uh, the c.C.N.V.-- How many belong? Well, there's-- never mind. Look, do me a favor-- cancel this demonstration before the press gets here. We still won't give you the visitors' center, but we won't not give it to you either. What do you mean? Let's just say that for the next few days when you get there the doors won't be locked. Is it a deal? All right, it's a deal. Thanks very much. [ Crowd chattering ] Bless you. Bless you. It's a start. Shh, come on, baby. Come on, have this little water. What's the baby name? J.r. - J.r. - Come on, j.R. Have a little more water. Where you get such a name from? I named him after "Dallas" so he wouldn't have to take nothing off no one. Hmm. I was scared to death worrying about you. Did you find out what happened to the Van? Not yet. Got some milk, though. Warmed it up too. Come on. Come on. Then if this isn't from the money hid under the seat-- oh, honey, you didn't sell any more blood, did you? Billy, honey, you can't do that no more. You gotta promise me. You run out of fuel-- you stop. Then what are we gonna do? Listen. Your children have anything against black people and hippies? Hmm? Muriel, how are you doing? We got a cot back there for you. You have someplace to put me shopping cart and me buggy? - Yeah. - It'll be safe? - It'll be safe. - I don't want nobody to touch my stuff. Nobody will touch your stuff. Carol: So what happened to you guys? Well, we thought we were set. Billy's daddy left him the farm. Then up comes this government farm official, tells us how to refinance and use the money to improve. Then grain prices drop. Instead of improving, we lost it all. I came up here looking for work. It's just like Iowa. There's nothing. Back home you don't even talk to black people. Then up comes this lady out of nowhere. I wouldn't have done it for her. Muriel understands. She's homeless too. We're not homeless. We just don't have no place to live. - Right in here. - Yeah, I got it. You got it? Okay, that's it. - Get the faces and then pan over here. - [ Crowd chattering ] Keep it going. That's right. Man: Turn that light off. You don't-- no, it's okay. It's okay. Come here, get this guy over here. I'm gonna get out of here. I don't want my family to see me on no news. Damn creeps. I knew there'd be a price. Come on. Come on, boy. You promised. You said we come here-- there wouldn't be no pictures. That's what they told me. Come on. There's a lesson in this-- never trust anyone that's sober. [ Laughs ] Forget them scumballs. You know the right way to get on TV? We get all cleaned up and then get on one of them game shows. With my luck, I'll probably win a dining-room set. You're more like the washer-dryer type to me. I got a mission on 2nd and d. You can quote me. See, here's the key. Sir, how long have you been homeless? St. Peter's pearly gates need a roof. Don't you know? I'm sure they do. Then take the tower of babel and beat it. You don't need it. Where are you guys going? No pictures, you promised. Hang on a second. - Max. - Hi, Mitch. How are you doing? What the hell do you think you're doing here? What does it look like I'm doing? Look, this may not seem like much to you, but this is their home. And you don't barge in somebody's home and stick a camera in front of their face without asking for their permission. - I'm just trying to help. - I'm not sure if you're trying to help or you just want a story. Another time in another place. Thank you. I'm very sorry, ladies and gentlemen. Please forgive me. It won't happen again. It's an unfortunate mistake. - Are you okay, son? - Tom, what's the matter? Grab him. Oh oh, easy easy. He's not drunk. He's sick. He needs a hospital. All right, let's get him to one. Up you go. Come on, buddy. Come on. Woman over P.A.: Security to west exit, please. Security to west exit. - Here you go, Jess. - Thanks. Do you really think he's going to be okay? We'll make sure of it. Don't worry. I hate it when you care about people. I really hate it. Yeah, I know how it feels. Do you? Sure. I was married once and I have two sons. If anything ever happened to one of them-- well, Tom's not your son, but you care for him like a son, right? What happened to 'em? Your wife and kids, I mean. Oh, they're in New York. She's remarried. They're very happy. We're friends now. But when we were together I had a big job on Madison Avenue making lots of money, but I couldn't make it work inside. I hated my life. It was contagious. I woke up one morning in a cold sweat. I knew I had to change direction. - She kicked you out, eh? - No no no, I kicked myself out. I decided to take some time off and try to get my head together. I was hitchhiking across country with this guy who, unbeknownst to me, had rented the car with a stolen credit card. We got busted. I got two years in danbury prison in Connecticut. And that's where I met the berrigans. The priests? The activists? You know them? Yeah yeah, I've read some of their stuff. Well, Dan and Phil berrigan were my cell-mates for two years-- the most important two years of my life. They taught me to accept the cup as offered, not altered, and to turn my own personal pain into something positive. And to do it through community. So when I came out-- okay okay, I don't need any more lectures. I'm sorry. So what's your story? It's boring, b-movie type. I'd really like to hear it. Yeah, you and Walter cronkite. You want some advice? Don't ask a person like me about their past. They don't want to remember, just want to get through the day. Here's his prescription. After you fill it I'd like you to-- how is he gonna fill a prescription when he doesn't have any money? Take it easy, Jessie. We'll work it out. Do what you can do. Thanks, doc. Woman on P.A.: Nurse Hanks, pick up line three, please. Nurse Hanks, line three. Did you know that Tom would qualify for his assistance checks if he had an address? But in order to qualify he has to get a damn address. You can use our address, okay? Now listen to me. The most important thing right now is for you to keep up your spirits for him. You hear me? Tom: Jessie! Jessie! Jessie! Jessie! Get me out of here. The curtain-- I peeked behind the curtain. Sammy Taylor is in there. They put me in a room with Sammy Taylor. Keep your spirits up, eh? See why it's easy to pour 'em through the neck of a bottle? I made your tea just the way you like it-- nice and sweet. Thank you. How was the take today? Not so good. A lot of the markets have started putting locks on their dumpsters. What are you doing? Making a cross for Sammy Taylor. Who's that? A friend of a friend. He's being cremated today. I want you showered and ready to go in 20 minutes. There's a capra festival playing downtown. Sorry, I'm too busy. This is non-negotiable. All right, you win. What's playing? "It's a wonderful life." Hey, thanks, Carol. That was fun. I haven't been to a movie in years. You want to go to another? There's a new Fonda picture playing in Georgetown. Let's check out the visitors' center first. I just want to make sure Mary Ellen and Harold have got everything under control. You can't throw these people out on the streets. We have permission to be in there. They've got nowhere else to go. What is this? Hey, Doug, what's happening here? Talk to the man at the door. I don't know. What's going on, guys? Excuse me, fellows. Excuse me. Hey, what's going on here? We're locked out. Why? Department of interior put their foot down, said they were getting complaints from train station passengers. Oh, that's just wonderful. It's supposed to drop 30° out tonight. What are we supposed to do, sit on sticks and play popsicle? What about our stuff-- our cots, our coffee urn? What about our stuff? Look, I'm sorry. I don't know. Sweetheart, I leave me buggy and me shopping cart inside. Can I go get it? Look, I'm sorry. I think it got tossed out. Tossed? What do you mean, tossed? Look, I'm sorry. They throw away my stuff? You mean, you throw away my stuff? Lord, they-- they throw-- - it's all right. - They throw away my stuff. All right, if they're gonna send us back out onto the streets, we're gonna pick the spot! [ Car horns honking ] What, are these people nuts? Looks like there's gonna be trouble. - You'd better go call it in. - Yeah. ♪ We shall overcome ♪ we shall overcome ♪ ♪ we shall overcome ♪ someday ♪ oh, deep in my heart ♪ I do believe ♪ we shall overcome ♪ someday... We'll walk hand in hand! ♪ We'll walk hand in hand ♪ we'll walk hand in hand ♪ ♪ we'll walk hand in hand ♪ someday ♪ oh, deep in my heart ♪ I do believe ♪ we'll walk hand in hand ♪ ♪ someday... We are not afraid! Man: We have too much and we're hoarding it... - Max, thanks for coming. - You promised me an exclusive, Mitch. Sorry, buddy, I lied. Don't worry about it. They're using cheese as landfill in Tennessee-- tons. The wrapping falls apart or it just sits there until it rots. And why not? The government surpluses are astronomical. Miss hombs, would you tell us what they are, please? The estimates for 1983-- over 700 million lbs of butter, over a billion lbs of cheese... You got any spare change? ...almost two million lbs of rice and almost two billion lbs of non-fat dry milk. For you, Mitch-- anything. Thanks, pal. Stick around. The main event's coming up. It's costing $1 million a day-- $1 million a day just to store this stuff. I say we save some money and we save some lives. We start giving it away. And look at this-- perfectly good food... While there are people all over the country all over the world, who are going hungry. - Woman: Good for you. - [ Camera shutter clicking ] Yes, hello. Is this the executive office of Bob's market chain? Yeah, well, listen, sir, I don't know what to make of it, but there's a bunch of people in the garbage dumpster behind your store on 8th street. Yes, sir, that's correct. And I just thought you'd want to know about it. Oh, not at all, sir. Just doing my Christian duty. Thank you, sir. Have a nice day. It's common decency and it's good stewardship. At least if it's getting tossed, why not toss it to some hungry people? Food banking-- that's the idea, passing on excess products to people who are really needy. But not enough stores are doing that now. I mean, even as we speak, this chain of supermarkets are putting locks on all their dumpsters. It's their food. I'm sure they have every legal right. What the hell is going on here? Hey, you, get out of there. Yeah, you. I told you to get out of there. - That's my garbage. - Who are you? Bob's markets. And I'm Bob. Get him out of there. Who in the hell do you think you are coming back here? Hi, Pete stark-- congressman Pete stark. How do you do? Bob, why do you keep the dumpsters locked? - Well, i-- - sir, are you aware of how much good food you're throwing out? Well, the dogs, the rodents-- I couldn't resist the urge to call him. I hope you don't mind. Mind? You're helping me to help people and I get to look good besides. What more could a politician want? I don't know. We called every office on the hill and you're the only one that showed up. Anything I can do to help. What would the health department say about it? You think it's healthy for people to go hungry? - Well, I can't just give this garbage away. - Why not? Well, overhead. I mean, company policy. You're the company, Bob. There is one more thing you could do. How about a lunch? Well, let's make sure the reporters are taken care of first. No, not now. I mean later, for the whole congress. If you could help us organize it I'd like to feed them some of the things we get out of the dumpsters, get some of those heads on the hill out of the clouds. What do you say? That's a very interesting idea. And you haven't tasted Carol's cooking yet. She'll give them a meal and I'll give them a message. Let's talk about that. Okay. It's called jicama. It's like a Mexican potato. It's very sweet. Do you like it? Do you believe it all came out of the trash? It was just gonna be wasted, thrown away. Nice talking to you. This is unbelievable. This is garbage? Oh, yeah, we feed hundreds of people every day on this trash. It gives new meaning to the term "junk food." Seriously, senator, you know, 10 people froze to death last winter. And even with the new shelter it's like a flood-- every day there are more and more people. So we need more shelters. It's as simple as that. Listen, you want my advice? Stick to these food stunts. Everybody loves food. You know, this quiche isn't bad. Hey, Pete, you know that surplus cheese you were telling me about? Let's talk to our committee, give some of it away. Great idea. Thank you, senator. You know that guy has the clout to set up a congressional hearing on homelessness? We've been thinking local, Carol. We gotta start thinking of ways to focus on the problem all over the country. Mitch, meet Susan baker. - How do you do, ma'am? - Hello. - Carol fennely. - Carol. Her husband's Jim baker, the president's chief of staff. And Susan is involved as a spokesperson for people in the private sector who want to help the homeless. And this is Melvin mander. How are you, sir? It's nice to meet you. - Carol. - Hello. Mel is part of a special task force being formed in the department of h.H.S. The idea is to match surplus government food and property to needy situations. Good deal. We need all the help we can get. What are you guys doing here? Why aren't you in the Pierce street shelter? We would be, but it's full. All will come unto thee ye broken lambs... Ye lost sheep of the true house of Israel. I go to prepare a place for you. I go to prepare a place for all of you. Mitch, my mission on d street. You'd think by now the task force would come up with something. Hallelujah. Hallelujah! Hey, reverend, old buddy, keep it down, will you? God's not deaf. The lord healed my foot, yet they did not believe. He brought manna in a truck for the multitudes, and still they would not believe. In my father's house there are many mansions. And there's a great big one downtown-- my mission on d street right next to the big hotel! We ought to check this out. Lead on, reverend. Here you go. Come on. This is my place. My mission. My mission. This is the place of my mission. Nearer, my god, to thee-- at last I got to 2nd and d. Let me find this key. My oh me, here we be. [ Chuckles ] - There it is. - Yeah, you did it. - Carol: Good. - Beauty. Perfect. It's big enough. It's centrally located. It's vacant. It's sold. Or at least it will be by April 25. So? This is December. We only need it between now and then. The utilities, Mitch-- they'll cost at least $5,000 a month. We'll pay them. All we need is a key. Actually we don't even need that. The plumbing, the roof-- it's unsafe. We'll fix it up. We'll give it back in better shape than we got it. Hey, look, in a few days it'll be Christmas. Please, just call them and ask. We already did. Ask again. Why don't you try it one more time, Mel, eh? All right. Thank you. Mitch, $5,000 a month? We don't even have 5¢. Where are we gonna get the money to fix it up? Margaret? Yeah, it's Melvin mander again. They say they'll pay for everything. It's Christmas, Margaret. Come on. What do you say we make some room at the inn, huh? Thanks. Bye. She says they gotta make some repairs... But you can have it in three or four weeks. All right. Thank you. All right. Now what do we do in the meantime? Reporter: In other news tonight, Mitch snyder, locally famous for hunger strikes and other activism on the part of the poor, finally had something to cheer about this Christmas season. We are very happy to announce that the homeless of Washington are getting a temporary shelter on 2nd and d street, but unfortunately, this shelter won't be ready for several weeks. And we just learned that the temperature's supposed to drop 20° tonight. That means some people could freeze to death. And we have whole families out here now-- men, women and little children. So we need your help. We need your ideas. We need your prayers. I guess what we really need is a Christmas miracle-- a miracle on 2nd street. We want to thank you for what you've already done and wish you a merry Christmas. That's a nice piece Max did. - Max: Miracles do happen. - Let's hope it answers our prayers. This is Max gunning, wxdc evening news. - [ Phone ringing ] - I got it. C.c.n.v., Mitch snyder. Oh, no. Yeah, I'm all right. Okay, thanks, Mona. I'll be right down. That was Mona Sanderson at the morgue. Uh, they've got an old black lady down there with a red Christmas corsage and they think it's Muriel. They want me to come down and identify her. I'll go. No, it's all right. I said I'd go. ♪ Let us adore him... Muriel! Stop it. [ Shouting ] You crazy or what? Let me go. I'm too old for such foolishness. You crazy or what? You see, the coroner's office called and they said that they had found a lady with a red corsage like yours and we thought that-- you stupid. You mean this? You stupid. I make one like this every time this year. Must be about 9,000 old black ladies down there with the same kind of corsage this time of year. ♪ Oh, come, let us... ♪ ♪ Adore him - [ phone ringing ] - ♪ oh, come ♪ let us adore him... Merry Christmas. And what is it? Mitch, some crackerbox wants to loan you a miracle. Max: All right, here we go. The hotel presidential, once the stately home of Washington's fanciest dinner parties, soon to be the victim of the wrecker's ball-- yet this Christmas Eve marks the final and perhaps the most moving chapter for this famous landmark. Last night's "on the spot" segment reported the please of Mitch snyder who asked for a Christmas miracle, a miracle on 2nd street. Enter a real-estate tycoon, Oliver t. Carr, who loaned his soon-to-be-demolished property as his Christmas gift to the homeless. Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa claus. But his heart doesn't stop here. Cars are lining up around the block with people dropping off food and clothing, restaurateur Dominique's has sent his limo with 10 cases of his famous senate bean soup. Volunteers are doing temporary repairs and offering to cook Christmas dinners. Woodie's department store delivered nearly 200 blankets and the U.S. government sent 500 army cots. And what do the homeless have to say about all this? Merry Christmas! This is Max gunning, w.X.D.C. Evening news. - There's no heat. - What do you mean, there's no heat? It's a holiday. They're booked solid. - They said they'd be here tomorrow morning. - Tomorrow's too late. Boys, let me tell you we've just ordered some heating oil. My people are gonna have it delivered within an hour. - Oh, thanks, Oliver. That's great. - We're gonna be warm. You bet. Thanks again. Now what are we gonna do about these holes from the air conditioners? We'll staple them up with everything we've got-- plastic bags, cardboard boxes. We got 30 more rooms to go. You got enough volunteers? - Yeah. - Good deal. Keep it up. All the clothes go over here. If you've got any food, it goes downstairs. And thanks very much, all of you. Mitch, would you stop acting like such a little general and relax? I am relaxed. What's this? It's a piece of Holly. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. Come help me hang some mistletoe. Merry Christmas. Hi there. Susan, hey, thanks for coming. I want to give you something for your new shelter, Mitch. Merry Christmas. Oh, thank you. Merry Christmas to you. God bless. People are good. They'll respond once they know there's a problem. Yeah, that's the problem. Look there-- cracked crab and caviar. [ Giggles ] The Arabian embassy sent that over. And you see that old lady over there? That's Muriel. She was a beautician most of her life. You'll look real pretty. You have to look pretty, you know, this Christmas. If you treat people like people, they'll act like people. Boy, I wish this place were permanent, you know? This is what we hope to accomplish with the real shelter. Come on, meet some of these folks. What you asked Santa. Yeah, open it up. Gloria, merry Christmas. Say hello to Mrs. Baker. Yes, I got that. And I understand. And I said I'd take care of it later, okay? Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Man: Our clothes have been stolen. You said it was safe here. We've come here. Now what are you gonna do about it? Our clothes have been stolen... - Mitch: All right, all right... - Snyder. Snyder. Hey, snyder, I told you before, this building was not to be opened till we had an inspection. And what's that gonna prove? It's a damn fire trap and everybody knows it. I don't have the money to fix it up and I don't know where I'm gonna get the money. - What's the problem there? - It's that pipe I was telling you about. It's what's left of the second-floor toilets. See what I mean? I am having a very bad day. And I'm not gonna spend any more of it fighting with you guys. If you want to move us out, fine. But if you do, I'm moving 700 homeless people onto your front lawn. That's not a threat. It's a promise. Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go fix the toilet. Hey, man, my old lady here-- she's pregnant. - I gotta get a place for her. - Yeah, I'll talk to you about that. Hey, Mitch, listen, we gotta get a ramp outside. I can't get this wheelchair up them steps without help. Where we gonna go on April 1st, hero? We gotta be out of here by April 1st, right? Mitch, look, I can't fix this pipe. We have to get a plumber. Give me a minute to be alone, okay, guys? Dear god, whatever happened to Christmas? You can't throw 700 people out in the street. - You just can't do it. - April 1st-- you knew you had to be out of that shelter by April 1st. Yes, and I appreciate the extension very much, believe me I do, but let's get something straight-- it is not a shelter. It's a holding tank. And besides, even a constitution has amendments. Look, if you take that building away from them they'll have no place to go. - How did we get into this mess? - Don't you think I'm asking myself that? You have no idea how bad it is down there. We are so short of staff and so exhausted that half the time we're walking around like zombies. There are three toilets for 700 people. But still, it is all they have and I can't take it away from them. I won't. Well, if you don't you will wreck whatever little credibility we are gaining with the government. Mitch, you're not lone ranger. We're trying to help people all across this country. What about them? What about them? The capital of the United States should be an example for the rest of the country. What about the $8 million the d.O.D got? Why can't that money be used to fix up the building, make it a model shelter? Because a] The d.O.D. Spent the money rehabilitating military installations, and b]-- they spent homeless people's money on military installations? Not so fast. They rehabilitated those barracks for the homeless. But that's not the point. The point is that you and your people have to get out. Mitch: How does this sound? "Initiative: That the city be required to provide shelter that is accessible, safe and sanitary and has an atmosphere of reasonable dignity." Sounds great. Good. We gotta get it on the ballot and get the voters behind it. We'll kick the whole thing off with a march to protest the closing of the shelter and to launch the initiative. With the presidential election in November? That's gonna be tough. The press will be more interested in interest rates and the arms race than food and shelter for the homeless. Yeah, you're probably right. Remind me to call the president and ask him to reschedule the election. - I'm gonna go on a fast. - No. Yeah, it's the only way. If I don't go on a fast nobody'll pay any attention to the initiative or the shelter. We've got to get these people a decent place to live. You don't fight battles on two fronts. You're fighting on about eight. The initiative will take a lot of work. You'll need your strength. If it passes, you won't need to fast. If it doesn't, you can kill yourself next year. I don't expect you to understand. And I don't even expect you to believe it's right. But I cannot not do this. And I cannot make another cross. And I cannot carry another one, not yours. I will not stay here and watch you commit slow suicide. And what about the congressional hearings? You insensitive, manipulative bastard. You promised. You said you'd help. All right. I said I'd help and I will. I'll stay till after the congressional hearings. In the meantime, I suggest that you and that ego of yours have a heart-to-heart with god. I thought the idea was saving lives, not taking them. First, an accurate approximation of the issues. That's Paramount. Next, if we can utilize the regional aspects and personnel rather than placing the entire burden of responsibility on the federal government. The question is who pays what share? The management, the coordination, the running of these programs in terms of the cost of these programs should be a shared cost. - How long have we been here? - Too long. Four hours. ...believe that the federal government ought to do more. Now I wish to acknowledge the significant contribution made by a number of individuals both in subcommittee and in the administration. I understand-- excuse me, senator. Ladies and gentlemen of the press, these people come last 365 days a year. I think it's the ultimate insult that they should come last today. If you want to hear about homelessness, come out in the hall. We'll give you an earful. Just a minute. Things have run a little longer than expected, but I guess we can hear from your folks now. Thank you, senator. The chair calls... Muriel. All right, darling. Let me tell you something, Mr. Big-wig senator-- there's nothing worse than being old and ugly except to be old and ugly - and homeless. - [ Laughter ] You laughing? You think it's funny not to have a place to lay your head at night, especially in the cold, or to have food to put in your stomach when you're hungry, or medicine when you are ill? I don't born here. I come here from the west indies. But I'm a naturalized citizen and I work hard all my life. I don't deserve this. You too someday may be old. We have to take care of our old people. We still have something to give. Don't take us and throw us away like a dirty dish rag. Because you may be throwing away yourself. Thank you. [ Applause ] I got shot up in 'nam and then misfiled my papers, so I don't get my disability. I had to leave my wife and my kids, or they wouldn't qualify for welfare. I can't find a job. We all got the same story. Three or four solid slugs to the gut, and it knocks you in the street. And then you're so busy surviving that you don't get a chance to get on your feet. The chair calls Mitch snyder from the community for creative non-violence. These are the cremated remains of a human being, a man known only as John Doe, who froze to death on the streets, homeless and alone. Let the ashes and bones of this dead man provide the framework for all I have to say here. Something must be done. In the words of father Daniel berrigan, such deaths are criminal-- a capital punishment inflicted on the helpless and innocent. People must cry out! Lives must be saved. It's as simple as that. Imagine, if you can, several million refugees moving slowly across this land. A ragged, retreating army of men, women and children, all wounded to some degree in body and spirit, searching endlessly for all the prerequisites, the necessities of life-- food, clothing, shelter and work. These are this nation's untouchables, America's disposable servants, the destitute homeless on a forced march to nowhere. Far away in another part of America the cry is heard, "they're there by choice. They could get jobs if they wanted to. And what about the moochers and welfare cheats, living off the fat of the land?" Ladies and gentlemen, the fat of this land has become a garbage can. How can people living on the streets be on welfare? You've got to have a fixed address to qualify. And all the homeless are employed. It's a full-time job trying to find a meal and a place to sleep. Why then are they there? And why are their numbers increasing so rapidly? There may very well of course be as many reasons as there are homeless, but chief among them is an increasingly conservative mood in this country coupled with deep corresponding cuts in social spending. There is the deinstitutionalization of our nation's mental health system. There is unemployment, inflation, recession. There is the breakdown of traditional social structures, family relationships and responsibilities. There is the shortage of affordable housing. The list goes on and on. And god only knows how many old people have been gypped out of their pensions or urban-renewaled out of their homes, or how much bureaucratic red tape has wrapped people into mummies. But the homeless have no political power. They rarely vote or consume. They're not organized. Statistically speaking, they hardly exist. The fact is, homelessness is unamerican. It goes against our grain. By and large, the homeless are thought of as a bunch of losers, because the basic fabric of this country continues to say, "anyone can win anything." And perhaps the final blow is, we think because we pay taxes we're absolved from any responsibility. Well, obviously, something is very very wrong. And what is wrong is the destitute homeless are missing persons, absent from our consciousness, from our deliberations, from our daily lives. We have placed a wall between ourselves and those that have no place to lay their heads, and that wall must come down. The homeless demand shelter, not excuses. They demand dignity, not the demeaning that comes from sleeping on sidewalks and heating grates. They demand that here and now in the wealthiest nation on the face of the earth basic shelter be recognized as an absolute and basic human right. If a major earthquake struck this country and several million people were instantly made homeless, we know that the great compassion of the American people would mobilize to provide food, clothing, shelter and comfort to all in need. Well, damn it, this is a major earthquake! We have come here to educate, to incite, to plead-- to do anything in our power to encourage you to do everything in your power to rid this nation now and for all time of this horrible human tragedy. And if you act intelligently, if you act compassionately, if you act quickly, you can make a very great difference. And that is the expectation and the hope, that is the prayer that we lay before you at the tomb of the unknown homeless. Thank you. Carol's voice: I will not stay and watch you commit slow suicide. In the meantime, I suggest you and that ego of yours have a heart-to-heart with god. I thought the idea was saving lives, not taking them. Mitch's: "Greater love hath no man than this, than a man lay down his life for his friend." I hear you, lord. I'm scared. I really don't want to do this. [ Door opens ] Mitch, you got your extension. They're not moving us out. Now that they're letting us stay in the shelter... Are they gonna fix it up? No, but we've gotten some calls from several of the churches, and now with the work on the initiative... [ Moans ] Mitch, you've got to eat. It's been 42 days. No. No more patchwork. No more races against winter. All I want to see is a place where people can live like people. A decent shelter-- that's all I ask. I won't watch them say the last rites. [ Door closes ] The lord is my Shepherd. I shall not want. So lead me, lord, prepare us a table before me-- table 10 commandments. Read all about it in the reading room. Woman: We'd like your support. Got bottled water and a water cooler. Woman: Thank you very much. Hey, we got over 1800 signatures today. The whole town's gotten behind this initiative. - All right! - That calls for a celebration. We got any soda pop? Soda pop? There is a man upstairs dying, betting his life that people will care enough to see what's causing it, and all we've done is get a few crummy signatures on that damned stupid petition! So what do you care? You're leaving. Hey, lighten up, Harold. No, I will not lighten up. Mitch is my friend too. Did you really think you're the only one in this house who cares about him? Nobody will pay any attention to us unless Mitch goes further than his last fast. Look, the whole idea is that once the initiative passes-- he'll be dead by then. He almost died the last time, and that was 40 days. It will be 52 by the election. That's not our fault. Carol, it is Mitch's choice. Damn you, Mitch snyder! I'm gonna go see Diane. Mr. Bishop, look, we don't have much time. If we don't do something Mitch snyder will be dead in two days. Now I am begging you, if you could just-- I'd like to, really, but my hands are tied. [ Moaning weakly ] Hi, honey. Hi. - How are you doing? - I'm okay, except I'm gonna sue my Barbie doll. Growing up-- life didn't turn out to be as I expected. Who's there? Hi. Look what I brought-- lunch. Hi. Mitch, please don't keep this up. 48 days is long enough. Come on, buddy, we need you. It's in god's hands now. Pray for us. They say Mitch isn't going to make it through the night. [ Exhales ] I don't want to be here. I want to be over at euclid house. I want to be close to Mitch. Come on. I'll push you over. In this weather? Besides, you got shelter duty. This is one night the shelter is gonna have to take care of itself. Let's go. [ Distant sirens wailing ] He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me on the path of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. [ Phone rings ] Hello. [ Gasps ] It's the department of health and human services. They've been getting calls and telegrams. The negotiations are over. They promised to fix up the shelter to make it a model. They want to know what it'll take to get Mitch to eat a cheeseburger. Tell them he's a vegetarian. Okay. Doctor: And, lady, you'd better call the ambulance right now. The other shelter is not too far away. It's so damn cold. But we're gonna make it. Forget it. We'll never get the wheelchair up those steps. [ Moans ] Here. No, you. No, you're the engine. You're the one needs the fuel. Here, go on. If we can get across the park, maybe-- maybe we can hail a car or a cop or something. Here here here. Let me. I'll pour it. Here, come on. We're gonna be okay. Jessie, come on. It's gonna be all right. Come on, get up. Please get up. Help! Help! Come on, get up. [ Crying ] Please get up. Get up, please. Reverend: Keep it on Jesus, who'll keep it on him, who keeps it on us. Keep it on Mitch. Bring him down back into our midst. Thy rod and thy staff separate the wheat from the chaff. He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high... Carol. Carol, how are you, honey? I'm okay. How are you? Surprise surprise. I'm still alive. [ Laughs ] No cartwheels, okay? That heart monitor is a little shaky. How are we doing on the initiative? We're winning in every precinct. Oh, good. [ Door opens ] Well, you've come a long way since you were just some guy hustling couches. What are you doing here? I work here, remember? Look what I found down in maternity. Oh, beautiful. Is it a girl or a boy? It's a little boy. This is nothing. We've got a whole vigil downstairs-- every hobo, every looney tune, every friend I got in Washington sitting out front, praying. Ah. Hey, guess what. Billy got a job. And just as soon as we save first and last month's rent-- I'd better scram. Anyway, I'm the message committee, and we want you to know we love you. Thank you. Cathleen, tell Mitch the baby's name. Mitchell Sam. Sam-- that's short for samaritan. Sorry about Jessie. What? I thought-- we love you, Mitch. Carol... What happened to Jessie? Last night Jessie and Tom were heading over to euclid house and Jessie didn't make it. Jessie froze to death. [ Moans ] Oh. We found his family. Jessie. You-- you know how Jessie was always bringing people into the shelter? Well, during the war he did the same thing. He ran out in front of the Germans and he'd bring those wounded guys back. He was a hero, Mitch. He won the bronze star. Man: Ready, aim, fire! [ Gun salute ] Ready, aim, fire! Ready, aim, fire! Ready, present, arms! [ Bugle playing "taps" ] Order arms! Parade rest! Listen, son, is good to look close. But is also good to look far, for when you look far, you'll see that this graveyard also meets with the sky. It's my privilege to present you with this flag. May it serve as a symbol and a constant reminder of our nation's gratitude for the service rendered our country and our flag by your father. God bless you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ceremony. You got any comments, anything to say? Well, just one thing, really-- the next time you see a homeless person on the street, don't just pass them by. Stop and say hello. Ask them how they are, how they're doing. If you can, offer to go and get them something hot to drink, something to eat. And if you can't do that, then just look that person right in the eye and tell them that you care. Because really you're only looking in the mirror. Thank you.
