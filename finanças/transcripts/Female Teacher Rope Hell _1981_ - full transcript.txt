I've got to finish this by today. That's all right. I'll just wait here. Because without private lessons from you... I won't be confident about taking the english exam. Excuse me. No! No! No! No! Stop! No! No! No! Stop! Help! Someone! Teacher! Are you all right? No! No! No! No! No! Someone! Help! Someone! Someone! Help! - Come with me! - Huh? - What's the matter? - The teacher has been... Teacher! Teacher! Teacher! Hurry up and save her! If we go in now, it will put her life in danger. That man is a beast. - Then what should we... - Be quiet! Teacher! - Help me. - Right... Are you all right? I'll do it. Right. I'll be going then. Hey... It would be better if you didn't tell anyone about what happened today. Of course. She's going to get married soon. If word of this gets out... Let's keep this a secret between us. All right? Bye. Teacher! Teacher! Teacher! - Good morning. - Good morning. Morning. What's wrong? You look depressed. It's nothing. You want to come over to my place tonight? Okay. No! Hey, what's wrong? What is it? Want a lift? Where are you taking me? A celebration for your wedding. My house is modest, but I've prepared some things there. I'd rather not. Don't worry about it. I wanted to do it. No, I'd really rather not go. Your face when you were being raped... It was so beautiful. This is it. There's something in here that I really want to show you. What do you think? Wonderful, isn't it? I did a complete renovation of the unused basement. Over there. Open it and take a look. Go on. You'll be able to live here without wanting for anything. What are you doing?! Let me out! Please let me out! Let me out! Just what are you planning to do? Do you even know what you're doing? I did my best trying to suit your taste. Please try it. Release me at once! If you let me go, I'll pretend what you did today was a bad joke and forget about it. A joke? This isn't a joke. I want you to stay here forever. But why? Why? More importantly, please eat before the food gets cold. Please, let me go! I beg you! I can't stay here! You're my wife from today onwards. Don't cry. Go rest for a while. No! No! No! No! No! No! Please, I can't bear it. Let me go to the toilet. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I'll take care of you in every way. Please do it in here. No! No! Our life together starts now. You'll get used to it soon. You won't have to do anything... Other than listen to everything I tell you to do. Is there anything you want? I don't need anything. Leave me alone. This will make you a pure woman once again. I cleanse you both in front and behind. From now onwards do your best... To quickly become a good woman that I can be proud to call my wife. That's it. Drink lots... And become more healthy and beautiful. That's it. That's it. More... More... That's why I think that Mrs. yoshimura, troubled by what happened... Might have gone somewhere. - That's all you wanted to tell me? - Huh? These things you just told me today, I'm hearing them for the first time... But to be honest, I'm not interested at all. Mr. tsushimal women are, in the end, women... Immoral and vulgar animals. Where she has gone and what's she's doing... Is no longer any of my business. Let her become as depraved as she wants to. Thank you very much. Welcome home, darling. This is the first time you've let me see you smile. I'm so happy. - Is this a bit gaudy? - No, not at all. Both your body and heart are shining. - You look wonderful. - That's great. I was hoping that you would like it. I've got a present for you. Look. Go on. It's an engagement ring. Try it on. I'm so happy! Mrs. yoshimura! No! This is your fault. If you hadn't done something like that you wouldn't have to suffer like this. Try to understand that. I want you... To become able to feel the same joy I feel, as soon as possible. Please, spare me already! You've tortured me enough already. What more are you planning to do to me? Now, repeat after me. From now on, I'll be a good wife. No! No! Sawa! Why are you here? Teacher! Look at Mrs. yoshimura, who you respect so much. She's now undergoing harsh training... So that she can become my good wife. Please! Let her go! She's going to die! At this rate she's is going to die! I could let her go. But in exchange you'll have to let me do with you as I please. Don't do it, ranko! Don't worry about me! Get out of here as soon as possible! Please, let the girl go. I'll obey you. I'll do anything. So please... Finally, you've let me hear those words. Without further ado... Why don't you fulfil the duties of a loyal wife? Teacher! Don't look! Ranko, don't look! No! Stop! You dirty whore! Your body had become used to the things I like to do. Its seems that you finally understand my feelings. You'll really let the girl go, right? What if she says she doesn't want to leave? What? She's said that she doesn't want to leave your side, no matter what. That means... She's studying english in my library right now. What have you done to her? Don't worry. I won't do a single thing to her that she doesn't want. Now... This time, turn the handle yourself. Go on. No. That girl is willing to become a substitute for you at any time. Go on. Quickly. Faster. Faster! Faster! Please! Me too! Do to me what you've done to Mrs. yoshimura. Ranko, you... She told me she wanted me to do this to her. She wants to become just like you. I'll always be by your side. And I'll follow you wherever you go. Help! Help! The end
