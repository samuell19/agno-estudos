Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, We would like to remind you that the taking of photographs, or the use of recording devices, is prohibited and is hazardous to the performers. Please turn off all cell phones and pagers at this time, Thank you, and enjoy the performance. That's my little soap opera, the soap opera is when I asked him onstage if he's been dating her. And he's like, Shut up. - Get out of here. - No, I'm serious. It's too much drama. - More than what it's worth. - I know, he was pissed. - Yeah I know, it's true. - We'll see you in class. I heard she said, 'So how long you been fucking her? ' - We need to talk. - Ry? Come on, don't be ridiculous. Good morning. Who's teaching today? - Mark. - Mark! - Mind if I share this with you? - Yeah. Sure. Mr. A, I wanted to talk to you about Ry. I'm having a couple of issues with her, and I was wondering if we Could you just pair her up with somebody else? - Who are we talking about? - Loretta Ryan, Ry. - Oh, Ry. - Yes. - Things aren't going smooth and I was just wondering... - I thought you two guys were. Well, I kind of want to Leave that part out of it and stick with the dancing. Well hey, You'd like to sit in this chair? You could run the company. No, I'll stick with the dancing. - Who's next, Cammie? - We have... Good morning everyone, There's no announcements, so let's start with plies. Left hand on the barre, second position. Ready, Paul? And... Good. A one... Good. Drop the chin. Take the head... One, two, three, grand plie. - That's my spot. - Sorry. Stretching to the bar... Would you mind standing over there. Thank you. Forward, one... Up to go back... And Demi... Tondue, close arms and legs together. Good. A one, two... Drop the chin... And drop your tailbone. Good. And stretch to the bar. Good. Do you know how long this company has waited for a Lar Lubovitch ballet? I'm glad to hear that. Thank you. - Mr. A is very grateful to you. - I'm grateful to be here. Please say hello for me. I'll try to drop in and see him later. Good morning. Is Alec here? Alec have you warmed up? You're warm enough for lifting? Absolutely. Then let's start from the first lift after the solo, Maia. We'll get back to it after Alec is gone. Let's see what you've got and then we'll just work on, work on tweaking the fine points, A little further over from center, Paul if you'll play the two little matched intro bars to the first lift. I believe that's marked in the score. Ready? - And let's stop. - I didn't let you get very far. You're overworking that position, little more subtle not so high in the knees. A little bit more hung, mostly along the shoulders, it displays. Probably not so much in the face, It's beautifully expressive in the face, the way you do it, But let's make it work in the body first and then we'll work our way up okay? Once more. Good. And up. And stop please. Are you working injured? I have a neck spasm. I don't think you should work injured, why don't you mark in the back. Let's see what happens, you should rest a little bit, take it easy, we'll pick this up tomorrow. - It should be fine. - Okay, I'm sure it wil be. I'm afraid I have to ask you your name. - Ry. - Ry. - Domingo. - Domingo. - Is Ry short for something? - Ryan. Nice name. Have you been watching this? - So you kind of know it? - Yeah. Well, let's see what you've got, Domingo and Ryan. Same process, with music just before the lift. Let's see. And up. Up one piece. Good, Domingo. Melt. Music. Lift, contretemps... Swing, up and down... Let's stop there. Good. You have been watching. Well you know how we feel about you, Deborah, How much we respect you as an artist and senior dancer, but we wanted to talk with you today about class. We'd like you to be an example to the apprentices and the new dancers. And usually you are. But if you change combinations they think they can change too. But I only change the combinations at the barre. - They look everything you do, you're such an example... - I know. But I'm 43 years old, and when it comes to centre, rehearsal and performance I do what I'm told to do. - You could come in early... - Let her do what she has to do. Remember we had that girl that used to come in an hour beforehand? She's not doing the roles that I... But look at Margot Fonteyn, what an example he was. Margot Fonteyn, you know Robert knew her very well. I knew her too but not as well as Robert, we hear you. You know, she was a dame. Deborah, do you have anything else you want to talk about before we finish? Now's the time. Actually I'd like to talk about the ballet Light Rain. It's a great ballet, but I feel some of the footwork is too fast. - Like the jete, jete, step... - So you don't want to be in at all? Well, it's just that I look like I'm working in it. - Deborah, we hear you doll. - We just wanted you to be first. Thank you. And I feel honored. Okay, thank you. Edouard, door. Where'd you get this salad? It's terrible. Who can do it? Watch on walking lady lift, the position of his arms and also that she's not horizontal to the floor, they may not be doing it perfectly. This is the danger point for you. Don't let that leg bobble, when you come down. Why don't we try that. Okay? Try without music. Let's just do a little Ronde de jam be preparation, for the walking lady lift, And attitude, And ronde de jam be... And up, more fragile in the legs. Whoops. Now, okay, it's okay. Alec, can you give us a hand? Have you been watching this lift? Can you show us how you would hold her, The objective is to get her a bit removed from your body, so she appears detached, and at a bit of a diagonal rather than parallel to the floor. Let me see how you would hold her to accomplish that. - If you stayed to the side... - Fairly lower on her hip. Good, good, good. You know what the difference is? He's locking his elbow in here, so it's not slipping back, try with music and then go past that, and we'll see what we've got. Mark, you're going to work with Amanda and Willy. And I would like to have the four ladies over here. Alright, Mark. So everyone, We're getting ready to start from the fourth movement... Take your places please. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Company, just move all this crap, from the wings here, You're going to trip over. Now, come on, let's do it. Every time we tell you this. Don't leave your stuff by the side of the stage. Mark, you know we can't start with all this clutter. I know. We told them right before this rehearsal... Well you know... If somebody falls over... Ok, Cammie we're ready. Everyone, places please. Michael, when you're ready. Two men, you're ready? Here we go. Sharp jump... Good, you guys. Tell him to stretch his foot. All the way in the wings. Good, you guys. Stretch the knees. Exit all the way. Good. Right on the music. Good, Suzanne. - Suzanne's gotten very strong. - Excellent. Good, Calvin. He's come along beautifully. We have to work on that double knee saut de basque. Tell Noel to burst from the wings on her saute. Good ladies! Hold it a minute. Hold it a minute. What happened? I mean, you're all so pretty. You know how I hate pretty! Now come on. Lift, thighs, Lift up, not so loady. And when you make those exits hit the wall. I want you to move out and hit the wall, You're not doing that. You look like you've got a load in your pants. But I love you all. You're great. Come on. - Oh my God, a storm. - I think it's just the wind. Have a good time. Most importantly enjoy it. Ok? Merde. And main curtain... Go! Follow spot one on the girl. Nice and easy, follow spot. Sound. Can you watch this leg for me? Careful, keep that from flopping down. Char, you better go back and see what's happening. If there's any water on the stage, I want you to cancel the performance right now. Hurry up. What did they say? The floor is dry, Michael's got it under control. - It's a little chilly. - Good, she's doing brilliantly. - That was so good. - Thank you. That was so good, Domingo. Are you coming back? Domingo. The hero of the moment. What a courageous performance. Scenery by Mother Nature. I don't believe you. - I'm Ryan's mother, Marilyn. - You should be so proud. Thank you for that beautiful ballet, my daughter was the dancer. - Lar. - Alberto! Brilliant, you were magnificent, did you organize that storm? Domingo. Fantastic. Hi, Dad. How you doing? - You were beautiful. - Thank you. Hi, mom. I want to invite you to come and do a piece next season. - I have to speak to Mr. A. - Now where is she? Oh baby. Give me a hug. I'm watching you saying, Who is that up there? Didn't I say that? I've always believed in you even when others weren't so sure. - But always. - But tonight... You went to another dimension. And the storm, the storm! - Wasn't that crazy? - It was so theatrical. - Was it slippery? - A little slippery. - You would never have known. - You had such poise. - Is this your sister? - No, this is my mother. Oh, your mother? - I can't believe this. - Thank you for your genius. Well, you look so beautiful. I can see the resemblance. - This is your father too. - This is my stepfather. - I see the resemblance. - I'm the father. Of course you are, how are you? - And you are? - Ginger. Ginger? As in Ginger Rogers. She wasn't so bad, was she? - Enjoy yourselves at the party. - Thank you, we will. - Very nice to see you. - Thank you. Mr. A. To Justin. Mr. A wants to do the ballet. But I talked to Harriet the other day, She said if I take it to Tucker he'd say no. - Eldridge Wright. - Oh, my god. How are you? - Can I get a glass of champagne? - How you doing? - I'm good, how you doing? - Pretty good, you did good tonight. - Thanks. - So how'd you feel about it? - I felt good about it. - Yeah? Good. Did Noel like it? - Do you Lar? - I know Lar, he was the choreographer. You know honesty, I didn't appreciate being the last one in the company to find out about you guys. - That wasn't cool. - You and I know what it was. Apparently you did, I didn't. Any way have a good night. - I'll call you. Alright, good. - Yes. Mr. A? Can I talk to you about Justin for a second? - Wait a minute. - There is a problem with the ballet masters... The protocol is this, you call the company, you talk to Edouard, - and you make an appointment. - I understand. Thank you. All the best to you. Honestly people are so rude. It's just too much really. Wait a minute you guys, I want to confirm something, Maia and Suzanne are in every single ballet... - Do they have covers? - Yeah we've taken care of that. Can we have a drop-dead date so I can tell wardrobe? The dancers must know the cast one week in advance. And they always do. - Are you guys finished up? - You've almost done. - Not really. - Good, because I think you've finished your meeting. Yes sir. Mark? Would you mind staying. Char would you mind, darling? And Harriet you stay too. Robert, is this going to be ok? My sketches are pretty big. We might need a bit more room. We could use the conference table. Can you move that crap off, get rid of those donuts or those bagels. Whatever they are. Good, good. So we start with a giant snake, a giant puppet. Susie, What are you doing here? Out, out! That's beautiful. So we start with a giant snake on stage. It's just floating, glowing blue in a void of black. How many dancers? There's about twenty dancers, we don't see them, But to make it really smooth. - Can you do it with ten? - No, we couldn't do it. - Could we cut the tail off? - Maybe. Yeah. Then from the snake flowing like that the black curtain goes up... it reveals the blue snake and it has the Shiva characters, of the cosmic dancer, the storyteller. - What's the ballet called? - Blue snake. The snake representing the spine. The blue is the shakti, the energy in the spine. Robert, I don't think you understand our financial situation here. I'm working with mirrors as it is. I can tell you one thing, this piece will be fantastic on this company. I believe you. That's why you're here. Thank you. I mean, I'm going to have to find someone to underwrite this whole thing, - I hear you. - It's going to be so expensive. I'm going to have to sell it to the board. Excuse me, what? Would you excuse me? I've got an important thing. - I can continue with the staff. - Let me just tell you, You are a genius. I'm never wrong about these things, am I? - He never appears to be. - Ok. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Oh, Robert? - Yes? Three things to remember, budget, budget, budget. I will do my best, thank you, - When we'll get the music? - The music is being written now. - Well then for rehearsals? - There is no music. Counts? No counts. I like the dancers to feel their own rhythm, and then the music can come in. It will be a new experience. That's not good, out of a straw. Oh well, moving right along. We can pass it around. Who threw this penis at me? I think this is more you, Missy. I think that's more your style. We got a salmon position 1, beef position 3, table 22. Sorry. - Are you a dancer? - Yeah. Thank you. Got it. Oh, John. What are doing here? Actually I was hoping if you had any room, I could stay here just for a little bit, a couple of days. God, I am like booked. You could put me on the floor. I've got my sleeping bag. - Just for a couple of days. - Alright, come on in. - Thanks a lot. - Just for a couple of days. What's going on? I thought you were staying with your family. I was staying with my aunt and... I think she committed suicide. Yeah it was her thing, So I can't stay there anymore. Can I use your pen? Thanks - God. I'm sorry. - Yeah. $8.50 a day, just for a couple of days. Just for a couple of days. Definitely. God, I'm so sorry. What's happened? Did she shoot herself? No, it wasn't that dramatic. She took some pills. I don't know, she was a little crazy. She was very eccentric. - So yeah, just a couple of days? - Yeah, just a couple of days. - You're last in line for the bathroom. - Right. Five, six, seven, eight. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, two, two, three, four stretch, five, six, step, step three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and four, two, three, five, six, seven, eight and one. And cross the fifths. And... two, three, two up three, three, five... That's it, long arms. Shoulders down, ladies. Lots of bourres. Shoulders down. Big arch. Hold, two, three, two... I got to say something here. Mark, turn off the music. Why do you always do this, babies? You always get phony on me. I don't know why you do that. This is supposed to the 60's. This is what the '60s were all about. Kids protesting against the war trying to change the world, so they bent the rules, turned to drugs, took off their clothes. They made a noise. Peace marches, singing their songs in the streets... carrying flowers when they were being beaten and pushed around. All that went into this ballet. You see, it's not the steps, babies. It's what's inside that counts. That's when you really begin to soar. Thinking the movement is not becoming the movement. Listen up company. Hello? Is this on? Is it on? Have a great lay-off. It was a wonderful show tonight. And don't forget, practice safe sex. Safe sex, babies. And remember, fish, broccoli, salad. No more chili con carne. Have a great break. Your grandmother got this when she was 10 years old. She wanted so much to be a ballerina. It breaks my heart she's not here, Loretta, she'd be so proud of you. I want you to talk to Mr. A. To make good his promise. Okay? And say, hey Mr. A let's make good on your word, you know about the ballet you were gonna create for me. I know you wouldn't do it that way, and it won't be right, that you did. You know, totally vulgar. But still... Remember that evening at that wonderful party? He dazzled us all, with his promise of building a ballet for you, in hon our of you, Where the hell is he? - Honey, do you have any wine? - In the fridge. The fridge? I don't really feel like white wine. I love that you have red wine in the fridge just like your mother. Now look, let's get down here to brass tacks. Loretta? - Mom? - Darling, it's time. I went to see Aunt Vynette today in the hospital. - How is she? - She's sad, diminished. - I'm here to tell you, I love your wig. - Thank you. Life is short. And it's time for you now. You've been featured... you've been acknowledged, your colleagues are wonderful... Mom, I'm going to be late, I got to get going. Oh, my God, those shoes, honey, those are dangerous. - No they're not. They're fine. - You could break your neck in those. - They're fine, Mom. - Honestly. You have to go. - This is yummy. - Good. Coat. I'm going back to the hospital. This suit cheered her up. - Give her my love. - I'll give it, and I love you. - You don't need this. - I push you because you're modest. - Your demur quality is enchanting, and your sexy. - Let's get going. You look very sexy right now. I'm worried about you. - It's fine. - Talk to Mr. A. Bring out his appeal to his Svengali instincts. Hey Dwayne. I'm in trouble huh? Can I get a Jack and Coke and a screwdriver? - I thought I'd pluck up the guts, and just do it. - So you did it? - Yeah. - I'll be back. I did it. I got the balls up and I did it. - Do you have a condom? - No. Sorry to wake you. Do you have an extra condom? - What? - Do you have an extra rubber? Yeah. Just one is fine. Thanks. Don't worry about leaving. - Just stay as long as you want. - Yeah. Thanks. Now I'm not going to stand here and go on about our next recipient. There simply aren't enough words. But suffice it to say, that his work stands for itself... that his life has been a source of inspiration to Italian Americans everywhere. So please join me in welcoming... the Artistic Director of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago... Mr. Alberto Antonelli. Thank you. Thank you. Please sit down. You know, I really deserve this thing. Because you Italian guys made it hard for me to be a dancer. You know, you didn't help one iota. In fact, I had to hide my ballet shoes. And my Italian family, they gave me such a hard time. Listen, if your boys want to be dancers, please don't give them a hard time. That would really be a special award to me. ♪ Photographable ♪ But you're my favorite work of all ♪ Cause your mouth's a little weak ♪ When you open it'll speak ♪ Don't change your hair for me ♪ Not if you care for me ♪ Stay little valentine - You better let me do that. - Really? - Yeah. - It's probably a good idea. Do you have a pan? - I can make toast too. - Toast is good. - What do you like in your eggs? - I don't know, anything. - What do you got? - Not much. Let me see... - Two tomatoes. - Tomatoes are good. - I have pepper. You want pepper? - Peppers... - Do you have onions? - No, but I have onion salt. No, that's ok. - Can you close the door. - Sure. Hi, gang. So, great we're finally starting Blue Snake rehearsals. I love it. I just wanted to tell you a little bit more about the piece. We haven't had a chance to talk about it so much... so, here we are at the beginning... - What's happening? - That's Mr. A's chair. Oh, la chaise du maitre. Je m'excuse. This one will do fine. At the beginning of the piece we've got the storyteller... and the whole piece is like stepping into a children's book. So instead of opening the book once he's done his opening solo, the overture, the mouth of the snake opens and the piece starts. The first section is, we have the zebra characters, they are in black and white, sort of representing the dualism of the world that we live in. And they come out like children holding hands, and do a circle dance. We enter into section two, the mouth of the snake reopens... we're into the red section, the monkeys are coming out. The whole piece is done sort of in primal colors. It's all very kind of fun and very colorful. And we go through a solo for a female balloon head, expressing sort of again the joy of the child, and eventually we come to this finale which has the giant. Ry, you still have a way to go with your line. And you also need to work on your allegro, especially Mr. A's allegro. I love allegro. If you can dance allegro, you can dance anything. If you're an allegro dancer, there's nothing you can't do. I mean I know you've got the, what I call "Ballet Dancers" They're in love with the lyricism and all that. But you know what I call them? Phony ballet. I hate it. I fight with these guys all the time. I wanted you. I wanted Ry for Snow pas, right? Yes you did. - You went out and she aced it, didn't see? - Yes she did. Mark didn't want her for Nellie Ely. Then he saw her in rehearsals. She was fantastic. I know where of I speak. Edouard, yes? - Mayor's office in 20 minutes. - I'll be right there. No, I can't right now. I'm late for the mayor. He's always late. - You scared me. Hi. - Hi. - How'd you get in here? - Oh, you know you gave me a key. Oh, right. - How are you? - I'm good... - I think I need a bath though. - No, I don't think so. - I'm really dirty. - No, I don't think so. No! Get out! Go. I'll be out in a minute. Jesus. - What are you watching? - I don't know. I found it up there. - No. You can't watch this. - What is this? Me, when I was little, being a geek. Want a beer? No that's okay. I got some. This is fascinating. So work was good? Oh, oh yeah. You know... Oh. - I missed you today. - Well, I missed you. - I can't believe you're watching this. - It's great. - It's humiliating. - Which one is you. Right? Oh yeah, on the left there. - Mmm-Hmm. - Aw. RY: The far too enthusiastic one. Horrible. JOSH: Cute. RY: Yeah. -I think if I really tried -Mmm-Hmm. I could do some of these moves. - You think? - I think so. I bet you could. Aha. Very good. Oh my God! - I'm married! - Congratulations. Thank you. MAN: Michael, bend down, pick up the skirt. Pick up the baby... Cradle the baby. Rock. Put the baby down. Then start your Bourree. To the corner, reach. Two arms up. Two arms up Reach, reach... and fall. Contract around. That's good. Stay low. Stay low. Reach back. Grab the skirt... Grab the skirt with both hands. Bring the skirt up to your chin. When you get the skirt, don't, don't touch it... Don't reach for it. You know, don't grab it. Well, how's he going to get it? There's 20 ways to get the material... I mean when you bring it round with you pull it to you like it's... - like it's a child. - But this the way you wanted him to do yesterday. You changed it from something else to this yesterday. Well, yeah that was yesterday. Now I want this. But you're changing it. There's no other way for him to get his skirt. - No. It's organic, you see. - That's not organic. He's down here and eventually he has to bring the skirt to this point... See it's organic. That's why it's so beautiful because... You're discovering new things in it all the time. You see here's the child. It's like... it's like... you're giving birth to the world. He's a man, he's a man. How's he going to give birth? There's the baby. There's the baby. You go down with the baby. Pick the baby up -The baby's over here. - And your giving birth. - This is a different thing. No. No. No. You're mixing up the babies here. That's a different baby. Okay? This baby is a metaphor. - For what? - Giving birth. Huh? You see here. See. I like this, honey. This is good here. That's the exact same thing we just did. - What? No, No. - That's the exact same thing we just did. That's exactly what I told him to do. Are you arguing with me? Yeah, I'm arguing with you because we've been in here rehearsing for two hours trying to do something and every time you come in you change it. - Why? - There's no way... There's absolutely no way that he's ever going to be able to get this to learn it, if you keep changing it. We're done here. Honey, come on let's scramble some ideas. Huh? Instead of some asshole who contradicts me all the time. Whoever has heard of a man giving birth to a baby? Where's it going to come from? Okay now, I got a million ideas here for music. Um, Adam, Adam? Just go work it out with them. Okay? Now let's do a little, uh, maybe a little contraction. Travel. Oh she's really come on. Don't you think? - Good. - Well done. Julianne, she's really lovely. But something, I don't know what it is. I can't point my finger... She's not quite there. You know what I am saying? There's something to do with the style. - Should we stop for a second? - Yeah. Julianne, let's stop for a sec. Suzanne, would you start from the beginning? Just do it once. Will you? Julianne, that was lovely. Just watch Suzanne. - So Paul, from the beginning. - Fine. Ready? See. Totally different. The height. - Yeah, she's got such lightness. - Yeah. Beautiful. Oh my goodness. Suzanne, are you alright? - Adam's gone to get some ice. - Ice, Ice please! What happened? Did you go over? I snapped it. - Adam? - What happened? - I snapped my tendon. - Did you come down from a jump? - Can you straighten your leg out? - We heard it. Did you hear it? I'm just going to do a test. - How sore is this back here? - Really sore? -She snapped her Achilles -What? - She snapped it. - I'll see if we can get some guys to help us. - It's been bothering her. - Can someone call Keith? - Can someone grab her phone. - We need to go on. All right. - Julianne. - Yes Mr. A. People, we do need to go on. Let's continue with Julianne. Paul, we'll go back to the solo. She's very good in this. She better be because she's dancing it tonight. Move it back a little bit. All right. That's great. Good memory. You remember everything that we did. I think we need to add a circular arm right, you finish this... I think we should add an arm there. It needs like a bigger break into this... side motion. And don't be afraid to go down with your body... I know it's harder to shoot up the leg but it looks so much better. If you go down, up. Ok, so let's add that little phrase. ALL: Oh, gutter! Hi. How you doing? - Maia, Michael this is Josh. - Hi. - Dancers in the company. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - You having fun? - Yeah. Good. Good. Trinity. Hey. - You got to get going. Bowling. - Uh-Huh. - This is Josh. - Hi. One of my best friends. - Nice to meet you. - You too. - I've heard a couple things. - Okay. - Hi. - How you doing? This is Josh. - Hi. - Good to meet you. Good to meet you. Here goes. - I don't have bowling shoes. - Grab a ball. Take it from the finale please. We're trying some costumes for the first time. Try not to get distracted by that too much. That's our only section with counts. So let's stick to them. Ready. One, Two, Three and four. Five, Six, Seven, Eight. And One, Two, Three and four. Five, Six, Seven, Eight. And Two, Two, Three, four Five, Six. Okay Trinity, this is where you come in to get eaten. Further upstage, way, way upstage. That's it guys. Stay downstage. Stay downstage. I'll be changing that, Stacey. I've got an idea for that. Come in closer, the four corners. Come in closer. That's it. Woman: Six, Seven. Alright, ok good. All right. We need to stop here because we've got something to organize. A world premiere at the Kennedy Center. I got to tell you, baby, that's pretty formidable. Babies, we need the room. Thank you. Well, why can't we do it at both? Both? Can you have two world premieres? Dump something else then. Dump Tensile Involvement. No. That's not possible. It's paid for. Oh, Harriet, I need to see you in a minute. What about this new kid then? He can wait until later in the season. Alec, are you dictating company policy to me? - Edouard? - Yes. - Edouard, do you have it? - Yes. - Is it hot? - Yes. Careful. It's a brilliant ballet, that's what you said, not me. You know baby, you have to learn to trust me. You know, we've laid out a great season for you. And what's good for you is what's good for the company. In this conversation what's good for me is what's good for me. How long have you been with the company, Alec? I hope not too long. I hope not too. - Are we threatening each other? - No, No, No. I don't make threats. You wouldn't have bumped Eddie Steirle. Well, you're no Eddie Steirle. Eddie Steirle was the future. - At 23? - Oh yes. Yes. At 16! He was remarkable. Such a terrible disease. So many losses. Bob... Greg Huffman, beautiful. Glen White. Jim Howell. The only thing a person can leave behind on this earth is the light of himself. I have hopes for you, Alec. Don't throw out the baby with the bath water. Ho, Ho, Ho. Merry Christmas. Welcome to the Christmas roast. Hey kiddo, how are you? - What's this? - Just the roast. - Are you going to perform? - No, no. Just watching. - That's all really silly. - That's what it's supposed to be. It's getting late. Come on Justin, you got to get your rest. On behalf of Mr. Antonelli and the entire administrative and janitorial staff, we would like to welcome you to fifth annual company Christmas Roast. And now it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to my personal hero, Mr. Antonelli. Ok company, let's take it from the embrace. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Hold it, company. Hold it. Hold it. It's too pretty. I don't like pretty. You see, this ballet was born in the 60's. In the 60's people were smoking pot, having sex... burning bras, dropping acid. That's what this ballet is all about. - Hi, Frankie. - Hello... What have you been up to? - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you. You know what that means, Broccoli, fish and salad. And more sex. My skit's up next. A little closer together and Colton with Sam maybe... No, that's not pretty. Mr. A, Robert Desrosiers. Company, company, I have a very special guess. A very talented choreographer from Canada, monsieur, Robert Desrosiers. Well, I just wanted to talk a little bit about my ballet that I am going to be doing... It's sort of like a storybook. And instead of a storybook opening the hippo's mouth will open... you see, the name of the ballet is called Hungry Hippos. And then the piece ends up, with sort of like this huge frog in the background but there is a problem... - A little problem. - What problem? The frog likes to eat dancers. Is really great. Yes. Do we wear Pointe shoes? Actually, you wear sort of like a Pointe shoe with a heel. So that you can walk around and then jump onto Pointe. We use it a lot in Canadia. It's great. So I think we could start. - Would you like to join us? - Well, shit. Okay. That is the spirit of the 60's. - What are they doing with that tape? - They're making something up. Thank you for inviting us to your party No problem. Are you having fun? - Having such a nice time. - Good. You were really cute out there. That's pretty funny. Thank you. I'm going to go and change. Okay? - Bye honey. - Bye. Ry. - Ry! That was beautiful. - Hi. Take a picture with your dad. - How you doing there, Rick? - Great, John. How are you? - Is that a new boyfriend? - Hello. Oh, I wouldn't say that. I felt so nauseous the last time we did it. I took some of Dana's caplets and they helped me a little. Yeah they're right here. They really help. -I mean you don't' get tired -It's not like from Dramamine. My mom used to take them when she flew. I don't know why I am... - Michael, can you come and hold the rope, please? - Sure. And Noel? Will you start. Okay. There we go. All set. Thank you. - You got it? - Yeah. All right, here we go. And go. And hold your middle. Good. Very smooth... And... head, and arm reach up, feel the vastness of the big universe And the coupe. And the split. Keep the back leg up. Good. That's it. - Michael, get rid of those chairs, will you? - Yes, sir. Go on. Nope, hang on, hang on, Noel. - Do you want it from the beginning? - Just carry on. No, no. - It's fine. I'm not here. - Oh okay. Now let's take it from the arabesque spins. And hold the arms... Good, Good, Noel. And into the attitude with attitude and swastika... And bourres. That's it, spot, and right. Good Noel. Now, right into the cartwheels. And - That's it. Are you alright? - Yeah. Great Noel, honey. That's great. Dana get up there. Just show her where your hips go on that rope. Just show her Just watch this, Noel. Just watch where she puts her hips here. - Okay. - All right. You see? Keep the pike. - You see that? - The pike. Watch the right leg. Good. And keep going. Two, three. One, two, three... two, two, three, three, two, three, four, four, two, three, one, two, three, six. Six, two, three, seven, two Good! Two, two and three. Good! Four, two, three five, two, three, six. Nice. Good. Seven, two, three and eight. That's a good place to stop. Let's stop there. Thanks Paul. - So what happened there? - Good. You know what, I want you to try to get her down on six... No, no. Five, two, on three. Because the next step I have to do is... Let's try if he puts you down on six ronde de jam be on two... I don't know what the guys do but all these years I've been doing five, two, three... That's the thing. The step's been missing all these years I have been looking onto the video. I'd love to put this step back in. But can't you put it back in before? Well, just try and see if we can do it on six, two, three. -Mr. A., you know -Edouard? Just a minute, doll. Okay. Carry on, babies. Good, Deborah, come on back and let's try to put you down on six. I've been doing this ballet for over 10 years. And obviously, he likes the way I do it. So I think the counts that I have been doing, it's sufficient. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! ALL: Five, four, two, three, one. - Good night. - Ok, good night. Hey. So sorry, I thought I was going to get out earlier. They wouldn't let me. Josh? Okay. Let's not take it from where you come out of the mouth of the snake... Let's take it from where you're circling. I'll give you a four counts, Five, six, seven, eight, One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three Five, six, seven, eight, One, two, three, four, Five, six, seven, eight, Justin's not getting it. He's just behind all the time. He's not comfortable. We could get, Michael to get in here -I'm sure Michael can do it. Let's stop. That's not bad. I really think that even as a group like we need to be breathing together. I still want to feel that pulse going through. Alright? And Justin? Look, we're a week away from the shows... and you really don't look comfortable with the movement. I'm going to have to replace you. Michael, you come in, let's take it from the top. Same thing. Four counts lead in... Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, one, three, five, six, seven, eight. One, two... Five, six, seven. That's it. The energy's much better now. Keep breathing. Hey. - Justin, what's going on? - I've been fired. You weren't fired. Mr. Derosiers just replaced you... in that one section, that one part of the ballet. That's all. He fired me. The choreographer has complete artistic control, Justin. Mr. A couldn't change it. If Mr. Derosiers wants it, you go along with it. - I don't belong here. - You do belong here. This is not a decision. Mr. A's policy is not to interfere with the choreographer's wishes. - Come on, Justin. Let's go. - Wait Justin, you can't walk out. I request a formal apology in front of the entire company. - For what? - For abuse. He's treated like every other member of this company. We're going to file a complaint with the union.
