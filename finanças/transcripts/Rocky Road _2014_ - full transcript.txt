The car, the apartment and, it pains me to say this, your job. What? I'm your top guy, I'm your biggest earner. Well you're also the most expensive employee in the company, so it's kind of a wash.

Yeah, yeah, thrilled. are you staying at the hotel again? Actually I thought I'd stay here for a couple days, maybe a week. Is everything alright? are you sick? I just have a little overdue vacation time, thought I'd spend it with you guys. But you always go to St.Burts St. Barts St. Barts You'd tell us if you were sick right? The boy says he's not sick. The truth is I am sick, homesick. Homesick for both of you. Let's get you settled. What happened to my room? Well, your brother... The one that gave us the grandkids. The girls just spend do much time here we wanted to give them a home away from home. So we packed up your stuff and we stuck it in the closet. Oh, except I think the girls took it out and made a little castle with it. Oh they did! will you look at that. Isn't it cute? Nice. So where do I sleep? You can use Sophia's bed, she won't mind. Oh really? We'll tell her. Perfect. Aw, Susie Barns, such a lovely girl. Yeah. You know she took over the old gallery on Oak Street? I haven't talked to her in eight years. I'm sure she'd love to see you. I highly doubt that. What's happening son? any special ladies? No. Just playing the field are you? I like to keep my options open. I never understood why you broke up with Susie. We were in high school mom. But you were so much in love, I always thought you two would end up together. You also thought I'd be an Astronaut and President of the United States. No I didn't, that's just something parents say to make their kids feel special. Right Ben? I don't recall saying he was Presidential material, no. Well I'm glad we cleared that up, I'll withdraw my nomination. You know, if you'd just stayed here like I said with the ice-cream business who knows where we could have taken this. Look at Ben&amp;Jerry, we would be Ben&amp;Harry.

At least you'll go out in style. I hope everybody's hungry, sit down boys! Here we go. Why is everything on a stick? That's your mother's new thing. It's fun, and you don't need utensils. Dinner on a stick. Oh not just dinner, everything. Name me one food that isn't better on a stick. Soup. Don't go giving her ideas. It's good. Maybe after dinner we could all watch a nice movie. Dad'll put something on the VCR. What happened to the Blu-Ray I sent you? I didn't get a chance to hook that thing up yet. It's put away. Actually I don't know, tonight I got a couple hours work I gotta do. So maybe we do movie night another night. Hey. Could you pass me the channel locks? Blue handles. Forgot everything I taught you Not everything. I remember my old route. You were one of my best drivers. You should have stuck with that. Yeah, think where I could have been now, the ice-cream king. There's worse things. There are better things. So how's biz? Well, you know, summer's staring school's out, the pools open it's gonna be huge. How many drivers do you have now? Well, not quite as many as when you were last here with us. Oh, did you see the new menu? Ah, chocolate bomb pop, sweet. Yup, that's a big one, that's a big seller there. When's the last time you raised prices? It's a small town, people want value. Doesn't mean you have to give it away. Get me the hammer will you? That's the one with the wooden handle. I know what a hammer is. Just checkin'. Morning mom, coffee? Decaf, caffeine keeps us awake. It's daytime, you're supposed to be awake. Where's the new coffee maker I sent you?

How wonderful, the prodigal son returns. We're worried about him, I think he took the bus. Maybe we can get him to come to church That's a good one. We tried. I'm sure it's nothing, after all I have four children and I never stop worrying about them. Of course they come to church. I can keep an eye on them at least once a week. I'll watch out for Harry. Thank you Reverend. Okay. Hey! no running, stop that! This church can't afford another lawsuit. Just get in there and tie yourself to the pew. Susie! Susie: Harry? You okay? This isn't my stuff. Oh no? not even the marshmallows? Okay, maybe those. Last time you were here you had a car and a driver. Well I've gone green. Yeah, and black and blue. Well it's your fault you know. If you weren't so good looking I wouldn't have fallen. Oh, haven't lost that charm. Nah, just my dignity. I'm glad you're here Harry. Really? Yeah, your mom's been worried about you. Oh. Wait, why? She says you're alone. I'm not alone, I've got people around me all the time. Well, she says you're having trouble meeting a nice girl. You having fun embarrassing me? Kind of. Well, sincere we're talking about my mom, which I wish we weren't, she said you took over the gallery. That's great. Yeah, Thanks. I'd love to see some of your new work. Oh you mean the paintings of the, oh how did you put it? The culturally barren wasteland you call New Hampshire? Did I say that? And worse. You kind of have a way with words. I was young and stupid. I can see things much clearer now in my old age. Yeah, the "no glasses" look is really good on you. We should grab some lunch or dinner sometime. How Long are you in town for this time? An hour? A little longer than that. Maybe there's a high school dance we can crash. I don't think so. Oh, I guess I have lost my charm. You haven't lost it, it just doesn't work on me anymore. Well here, you can throw this at an old picture of me. I tore all those up. All of them? Take care Harry. It's Harrison. Judge, Jury, Executioner, ! Ah run to the left Ah! Revenge is mine! I am your master! He's regressed back into being a teenager. We should have done this weeks ago. You live in my house you play by my rules. Laundry piled everywhere. Harry! One sec, I'm in the pass of doom! So are we! Excuse me. No! now I'm back to level Five. You've been here for eighteen days now. That's all? Well time goes slow when you're a child. This isn't a visit home is it? It's an extended visit. Alright. I was laid off, temporarily. I'm just waiting for word from the firm. So you're living here. I wouldn't call it living. What about your apartment, your car, your savings? Gone, gone, and what savings? I don't understand, you make so much money. It's New York, Dinners, clothes, vacations. If you wanna be successful, you have to look successful. Haven't we taught you anything? This is Wall st. dad, not Main st. Oh, okay. Well this is the key to the truck that sells ice-cream down on Main st. If you're gonna be living here, you're gonna be jingling that bell. Not the paper hat. Yes the paper hat. Welcome home son. Turn that machine off. Where's the fleet? Well, you're looking at it. A truck and a bike. Well all the other trucks are getting kind of run down so, gas is expensive. I ordered some new ones but apparently they've backordered so You can't run the summer on a truck and a bike. Yeah I can. Wow. Yeah? I love what you've done with the place. Well, it's functional. So's an interrogation room. I was just remembering how I used to pick you up from school in an ice-cream truck, how you'd love that. No one wants to be picked up in an ice-cream truck dad. I guess, except people who love ice-cream. What are you drinking? Hot water and lemon. Why? Why? Because your mother saw something on T.V. that said caffeine's not that good for you. So now it's hot water and lemon. Dry Ice first, ice-cream last. I know dad, 'Atta boy. Close the door, you're letting the cold air out! Hey, Mr. Price Hey buddy boy Any news on the merger? No, no, not yet, what are you still in St. Barts? Hey, service is terrible can I call you back in one minute? Alright, ok you've got a minute. Hey, I'm having a having a hard time hearing you.

Have fun. Oh, here you go, new extension cord. The upgrades keep coming. And don't forget to plug in 'cause that dry goes and just melts on you in this weather right?

Oh come on Mr.B, look at him I've got seniority. Actually I do, I've been here since '98 when you were in diapers. Harsh. Hey! Put on your hat. Put on yours. Nice negotiating, that business degree is really paying off huh? That's who's representing you on the streets? We're selling ice-cream, not mutual funds. Does he even have a drivers licence? As far as I know, I don't think you need one for riding around town on a bicycle. C'mon let's get going. And don't be stopping for a swim right? We got a lot of inventory to move today. Come on.

Hello Harry. Hey Reverend. I'm sorry I didn't recognize you. Maybe if you came to church. Yeah I've been a little preoccupied. Mhmm. Your mother's been worried about you. Did you take a bus? Mothers, can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em, right? Seeing as how you're living with your mother at the present moment I'm not sure that's an accurate assessment. I'll have an ice-cream sandwich. Good choice. Thank you Uh, that's a dollar fifty. Your dad charges me a dollar. Of course he does. You know Harry, faith is the first step, even when you can't see the staircase. What does that mean? I have no idea, but when you figure it out, you tell me. 'Cause I'm dying to know. Waffles on a stick. My phone's broken. Did I do that? No, It's my fault. It was in my pocket. You can have one of ours, we have an extra it's still in the box. No this is my new number, so just have him call me here. What? No I'm not under water, I'm in the Caribbean so service is spotty. Yeah I'll have two Pina coladas, thank you. Hey Kids who wants ice-cream? I'm not supposed to talk to strangers I'm a stranger I grew up here. If you grew up then why are you wearing a paper hat? You want ice-cream or not? I'm lactose intolerant. That's over diagnosed. How about you guys, you want some ice-cream? Does it have gluten? What is this, a playground or a weight watchers meeting? It's a church. Are you hustling my kids for ice-cream money? No. Wait, you have kids? I teach Sunday school. It's Saturday. Nope, it's Sunday. What's going on Harry? Well, I'm kind of living with my parents again, temporarily, and selling ice-cream. It's kind of a sticky situation. Oh, I'm sorry. On the plus side I got the A route. Oh. Hey! Those are my customers. Not any more. No poaching. This is open turf. Since when? Ask your dad. Ask your dad! You know what? Maybe I will. And guess what? He's a lot bigger than yours. Bring your whole family. It's good to see you're all grown up. C'mon Kids. Hey, a little bird told me, your mother, that you, what did you run into Susie again? I'd rather not talk about it. You know, I've always thought that love is a lot like ice-cream. Dad please. There are a lot of flavours out there right? And then you find one that you love and you stick with it. How poignant. Thank you. Oh, this is very important, this is gonna go to the seniors' centre, no charge. No charge? No charge, it's their bingo night. So they're winning money at bingo while you're losing it. Everything's not about making money son. Yes you made that crystal clear. You're giving away pistachio? That's a big seller! Oh, they love pistachio, it means a lot to them. That's nice, and when are those new trucks coming in? Just in time for winter? Yeah any day now I think. You know if you tried to make an actual profit you wouldn't be stuck here? Stuck? In this town, in this life. Well I like it here, I like this town, I like this life. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way, I just want you to be.. What? Someone else. No, it's just, ice-cream? You could be so much more dad. You know, you may not believe this son, this may not be the sexiest job, and it sure doesn't pay the best, but living here and with your mother in this town, I'm actually happy. Here you go. You could be happier. Well who couldn't? So don't forget about the seniors eh? That's no charge, those people are on a fixed income they'll get very upset. Have a nice afternoon You're new huh? Sort of. Don't tell me, you're Ben's kid? Pretty much. I pictured somebody a little taller. Hey look, we need a fourth for lawn bowling are you any good? Probably not. What have you got here? It's all vanilla there's no pistachio in here at all. Fresh out. That's okay, tell your dad thanks from me and the gang huh? You're a pretty grumpy guy for an ice-cream man. You should smile more you know that? It won't melt the ice-cream. What are you doing? I'm serenading you. The house looks nice, I see you've still got that squeaky old porch swing. Yup. If this is your ice-cream pitch it needs work. Does your dad know you're ruining his business? Yes. What do you want Harry? I was kinda hoping you'd hop in and ride the old route with me. Like the old days. It's tempting, but I'm gonna have to say no. Aw, c'mon I got the A route. We could stop by the pool, I'll let you ring the bell. Do you use the tactics on Wall St.? Yes. Do they work? Usually. Well, I guess they don't know you like I do. Actually no one knows me like you do. Is that Rick Johnson? Yep. Tennis partner? Not exactly. Please tell me you're not going out with him. He's grown up, we all have. Well most of us. Hey. Hi. Burk! I heard you were back. Yup in all my glory. Oh yeah, nice wheels. Yeah, you too, finally got that sports car huh? Well, you've been gone a while, that's my third one. You a used car salesman? Lawyer. Same thing. That's funny coming from an ice-cream guy. Actually we prefer ice-cream technician. Do ya? Rick helped me negotiate the deal with the Gallery. She's an amazing artist. Oh, I know. Shouldn't you be off selling Eskimo pies or something? No rush, I have all day. Oh, unfortunately we don't, We've got a match at the club so ciao. My lady. Hey wait, I can't let you leave empty handed. Your favourite. You remembered. Here councillor, on the house. Oh yeah, ice-cream might stain the upholstery, so thanks. Not if it's real leather. Oh it is. Later Skater. I'm sorry, I lost track of time. That was three hundred dollars of inventory, you realise that? You know what? Take this it's worth five times that. I don't need your watch, You need the watch, you lost track of time. Okay I'll sell it and pay you for the inventory. It's not about that, this about responsibility. Responsibility and character. I'm disappointed in you son. Tell him I'll make it up to him. Go to your room Harry. You need to fix that mobile, Pluto's no longer a planet. We're going to the Reverend's for dinner, If you go out, turn out the lights. Where am I going to go? You know what? I think he should just stay home, and just think about who he is. Hi. It's beautiful Susie. Thanks. It's for sale. I'll take it! Would you trade me for a watch? No, but I'll trade you for that doorstop. Yeah, my new phone, actually my parents phone, they shop at a museum so it's a valuable. Ah, very vintage. Yeah, vintage. So, uh, you and Rick Johnson huh? Believe it or not he's actually a really good guy. Oh so he's only a jerk around me. Well you really bring out the worst in him. Just tell me it's not serious. I dunno. Rick Johnson, I gotta say, I never saw that coming. How could you? You've been gone. Well I'm here now. Are you? It sure feels like it. Come on Harry. One call from Wall St. And you'll take off without a glance back. Just like last time. I'm sorry, I should have handled things differently. I just wanted to leave here so badly. I noticed. I screwed up. Was it so awful here? No, I just, thought I wanted more. You got it. I guess. Well, I should get home. I'll join you. Where's your truck? Plugged in, next to my bike. I forgot how quiet it gets here at night, I like it. You didn't used to. Dunno what you've got 'till it's gone right? There's that charm. Still not working? Nope. How about this? Will you accept this rose? You do realize that that's the Fiona Greber's prize rosebush right? She still lives here? Yeah. Is that you Harry Burk stealing my roses? It's Rick Johnson. Oh, you should be so lucky. I never liked you as kid Harry, Nothing's changed. Sorry they'll grow back, have a nice night. Personally, I think she's so mean because she has a big crush on me. That's always a problem isn't it? Always. Do you remember when we took your truck down by the river, and all those ducks got in? Oh yeah, they ate all the popsicles. Your dad grounded you for a month. Yeah, I think he'll ground me tonight. How long this time? 'Till my 40th birthday. Some things never change. Some things do. Do you think there's any way we could just, forget about the last eight years? No. Yeah, you're right. But I suppose we could be friends. Ah, the friend zone. Hey you're lucky to be getting the friend zone considering. I'll take what I can get. Hi. Hey, you ready? Sure, where we going? Ha Ha. Harry and I were just talking about old days. Ah well, you know what they say, The past is history, tomorrow's a mystery, and today's a present. Who says that? Well it definitely wasn't an ice-cream man. Maybe a used car salesman? Lawyer. So you keep saying. Would you two stop it? We can't. Oh no I can, 'cause see, I got the girl. Oh, and the job, and the car, awkward. See? You can't stop. Revenge is sweet. And a dish best served cold. So basically revenge is ice-cream, which reminds me, it's past my curfew, goodnight Susie, Rick. Goodnight Harry, say hi to your parents for me. Yeah me too. Let's face facts here, we're not getting any younger, and we both said this was gonna be our last season. I was just kinda hoping we'd go out with a bang and not a thud. We'll get through this. Of course we will. Get through what? Huh, I thought you were upstairs in your room. Where'd you go? Who cares, what do you mean last season? Honey, we didn't want you to know. Are you sick? No. Dad? I'm shutting it down. Rocky Road is finished, come labour day that's it, we're closing the doors. What about the new trucks. There's no new trucks, I can't compete look you know these, they're opening up ice-cream parlours and frozen yogurt places everywhere nice places too. I can't compete. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me you were fired? I dunno, I just See, same thing. Actually to tell you the truth I just didn't want you to see me as a failure. But now, as things turn out, you were right all along. Dad, we can fix this. It's done, Marla. 'Night Harry. What's all the racket, what's all this? I'm pretty sure it's every present I've ever given you. BluRay, flat screen T.V., Wireless speakers, electric foot massager, New microwave, electric knives, Panini Grill, the Juicer you remember of course, and what kitchen would be complete without a Japanese rice cooker? How's she gonna get the rice on those little sticks? I can try. Well I thought you should at least try everything, whatever you don't want you can give to the seniors centre. Arigato, Harry. You'd better wait until we get the electric bill. Fresh squeezed. Now how many oranges would you have to use to get a glass this size? Just try it. That's amazing, isn't that great? You know what someone once told me? Life is a lot like ice-cream, enjoy it before it melts. I cannot believe that you remember that. I remember. Did you remember to get electric skewers for your mum? I did not. Welcome everyone, it's good to see you out on such a beautiful day. I'm seeing a lot of old friends, a lot of new friends, and Harry Burk. It's never too late, is it? It's never too late Harry, but please, no more interruptions. The Lord does work in wondrous ways. Seeing Harry back with us today is the perfect lead in to todays sermon, The Wayward son, God's love is unwavering even when one is lost. The Bible says: And not many days after, the younger son, like Harry, Gathered and took his journey into a far country, like New York City. And there, wasted his substance with riotus living, like town cars, beautiful penthouse apartments, and expense accounts. Now obviously I'm paraphrasing people, but that's the least of my sins. What the Bible is saying here, is that we are all equally wise, and equally foolish. Let us pray, Harry. Why do I feel like that whole sermon was directed towards me? Well you should have heard last week's sermon. What, that was about me too? You look nice. You too. Thank you, it's the only jacket my mom hasn't shrunk... yet You could do your own laundry. I'm not allowed. Oh. 8 cylinder of course right? Susie? Hi! I just talked to your parents in Florida, they want you to call more. Really? I call every day. Twice a day would be good. So nice to see you two kids together again. We're not together mom, Susie's with Rick. Hasn't that blown over yet honey? Mom. Hey, Mrs. Burk, I didn't know your husband was a car guy. Actually our first date was in a '68 Shelby Cobra. Dad had a sports car? He built it himself in the garage. You kids think we were never your age, you'd be shocked at some of the things we did. Ugh, over sharing mom. Why don't you two join us for lunch? Oh, yeah, we'd love to. Um, actually we got that thing. What "Thing"? It's a work thing, at my firm. It's Sunday, It is Sunday, right? Uh, yeah. Look, I didn't want to do this here. Is this about Dallas? How do you know about Dallas? Your mother talks to her hairdresser, her hairdresser talks to Fiona's sister, Fiona's sister told Fiona, and Fiona told me at Sushi Clas. What's in Dallas? Me, and I hope you too. Uh, I was offered partner, at the Dallas office. That's fantastic knows, I for one, am elated. I start right after labor day, and I want you to come with me. What? Come here Come with me. Rick, I can't just leave, everything's here, my home, my work. I know, I've thought it all out, Look Pat can run the Gallery here, My Frat buddy has connections with the top art dealers in Dallas, You can paint anywhere, right? Look it's only for two years, and then we can move back here if you want. You really have thought this all out. Yeah I was gonna tell you tonight, over a romatic dinner but, are you still here? Look, I know it's none of my business, but what kind of offer is that? You expect her to just follow you across the country without a commitment? Without any promise of a future? Harry. No, we're friends right? Friends don't let friends go to Dallas. Burk, for once, you're right. Wait, what are you doing, I'm just spitballing here, get up. Marry me Susie. I love you, and I would have asked you eventually, so why wait? We've only been going out for six months. But we've known each other our whole lives, I don't wanna make the same mistake he did, I don't wanna leave you behind. No fair I was a lot younger than you. I don't know what to say. Say you'll think about it. You okay? I think I'm gonna be sick. Hey! You've got work to do Mr. Let's go, fun time's over. Harry! No free ice-cream until wednesday guys. Does it look like we want free ice-cream? C'mon over here for a sec. C'mon I bet on horses faster than you, hurry up. Do me a favour, gimme that paper hat will ya? Ya know, just because you're scared to lawn bowl doesn't mean you gotta drive around looking like a chump okay? Here's a little something from the gang here at the seniors centre, one for you, one for your dad, one for whats-his-name. Anyway just our little way of saying thank you for, for everything. Thank you Jerry, thank you guys. And uh, we'll see you next wednesday huh? And uh, Don't forget the pistachio this time huh? I won't. He's a good kid huh? How'd it go? Jerry gave us some hats. Oh, nice, what about ice-cream, did you sell any ice-cream? Not much. I don't understand it, Sunday was our best day. You know, you wanted me to think about who I am? Well I have, truth is, I'm a selfish, shallow jerk, who walked away from everybody who cared about him, and lost sight of what's important. And all these years, I've been trying not to be like you. I know, I embarrass you, I always have. Dad, I'm sorry. There's no reason to apologize, it's okay. No, It's not. You know, It doesn't really matter what you do in this life, What matters is that when you do decide to do something, you do it right. You do it with integrity, and from the heart. I thought I was, but I was just kidding myself. I was a shark, afraid to stop moving, because if I did, I might realize how empty I was. I forgot what it's like to be around people who actually care about each other. If I accomplish nothing else this summer, and I probably won't, I'm gonna bring your business back. No that's not true, we're gonna bring the business back. You and me. Are you a magician or something? A salesman, just like you. Yeah except I sell fudge bars, you sell hedge funds. Like I said, we're both salesmen, try it on. According to market research, Espresso's the new latte, bagel's the new muffin, Fro-yo's the ice-cream, and greek yogurt's the new Fro-yo. I dunno what you're talking about. Trends. See that's all you do on Wall st. isn't it? you follow trends. No, we make trends. Trends are fickle. So are customers. That's true, I'll tell you what's not fickle, ice-cream. It's always cold, it's always sweet, and it alwys tastes good. And when the weather turns cold so does the business, And we have to deal with that seasonal issue. You're right, you're right, you're right. And we need a new slogan. Why? What's wrong with that slogan? "Everybody needs Ice-cream", What's wrong with that? First of all, nobody needs ice-cream. Well you can't go and say that, "Nobody needs ice-cream"? We need something that pops. That pops. "What happens on the truck stays on the truck"? Heheh, no. "Ice-cream never sleeps." You kidding me? Okay, it melts. Unless you plug of course, sorry. I dunno, I always thought things would just stay the same. Change isn't always a bad thing. It's not always good either. It can be, there's been a few improvements since the VCR. Alright, I'll tell you one thing that I wouldn't mind changing. That song. That music on the truck has been the same for 20 years, it's driving me mental. Then why do you keep playing it? I dunno, I guess I'm just lazy, it's a habit. Dad you can listen to anything you want, what do you wanna hear? Rock? Classical, Oldies?, New age? Really? I like Jazz, I could have Jazz. Jazz... Retro yet edgie, soothing yet somehow distrubing, I like it. Really? Yeah. You're not just saying that to make me feel good? Jazz. Imagine an ice-cream truck that plays Jazz. Take me to it Daddy-o. That'd be pretty good. Yeah. Good shot, Here you go Jer-Bear. Thank you Harry, really appreciate this, gonna hit the spot. Here, put these in the freezer will ya? I know how many are supposed to be in there. Alright, okay. Let's show this guy something he can't learn on the internet 'eh fellas? Woah woah woah woah! Alright here we go eh. I thought you'd never done this before huh? It's not nice to lie to your elders. Look at that! I get first dibs on the ice-cream. Re-match Jerry, next week. Next week. See ya Harry. Those guys are intense. Jerry's city champ, how much did you lose? A box of pistachio bars. Ugh, you got off easy, I had to paint the activity room. So, Dallas, you'll need some cowboy boots, and a big hat. Dallas actually has some paved roads these days, with buildings and everything. Is that what Rick told you? 'Cause you cant trust anything that guys says, he's a Lawyer. Well, If you're asking if I've decided yet, I haven't. Good. You do realize this doesn't actually involve you. Actually it does, he wouldn't have proposed if it wasn't for me. So you're saying you don't think he's really in love with me. Of course he's in love with you, who wouldn't be? Shouldn't you get that? It can wait. What if it's a job offer? I have a job, besides I can't leave here right now. What's wrong? Rocky Roads is closing its coolers. What? Yeah, My dad didn't want to tell me. He didn't want to look like a failure in front of me. I'm so sorry, Rocky Roads is his whole life I know. I can't imagine this place without it. You know, your parents gave me my first paint set. Oh yeah, the pink eisel. Yeah, it was my tenth birthday, and we had pink ice-cream too. Oh yeah. Yeah. You know, if you need help with anything, just let me know. You snooze you lose old-timer Old timer? That must hurt. You're the same age as me. Oh, cut him off at 4th and settle this thing at the kiddy pool. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow? It's Sunday, church. Wow, that's four times in four weeks. You counting? Everyone is, Reverend's got a pool going. Hey, Mr.Price. Hey buddy boy. Thanks for getting back to me. Alright here it is. Any longer and I'm gonna be as old as you man! C'mon gramps I 'ain't got all day. Hey I'm just closing a deal, talk later. Ethnic food's pretty popular these days. Yeah there's a lot of signs there. It doesn't go bad as quick. That's a good point. You boys gonna be at this for a while? Ice-cream never sleeps sweetheart. Can I get you anything else? Hot water and lemon? Okay now I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I never want to see another cup of hot water and lemon again. I guess a little coffee couldn't hurt. Make mine a double espressso, it's an all-nighter here. Harrison, where do we keep the high octane stuff? Uh, between the electric pepper mill and the rice cooker. Oh, I'm starving. She does these great. Sticks. What? Sticks are the new forks. I know how we're gonna save Rocky Road. Oh that's Major, you want all the ovens? Yeah, sounds good You're the boss. Oh, now you're catching on. Yeah, it takes me a while, when I get there I get there. Woah dudes, what happened here? Well we're re-tooling, if you wanna know. We're diversifying see. We're gonna do cold food in the summer, we're gonna do comfort food in the winter, and you're late again. Oh yeah sorry, 'cause I was at the.. The Library? Oh how'd you know? Lucky guess. My son doesn't tolerate lateness, you wanna work here, you gotta be on time. So grab some gloves, and pass me the channel locks okay? Uh, the which? Blue handles. Am I still on the B route? Oh all that's changing too. There ya go. Cool. Hello. Hey. Listen to this. Okay, well there's also this. Oh, Fiona Draper's garden? No, she had a dog in her yard. It's a Chihuahua Well it sounded bigger. Come in, I'm almost finished. Wow, I haven't been here since.. You plugged your truck into the house and blew the electrical panel? Right, I forgot about that. My parents didn't, they still mention it. They do? Yup, and now that I talk to them twice a day they mention it a lot. Here, take a look I finished your new artwork. It's amazing! Yeah do you like it? I love it. Thank you Susie. You're welcome. You know if you didn't put me in the friend zone, I'd hug you. Friends can hug. Come here. Can they kiss? Alright, when is the grand reopening? Labor day weekend, the same say you're going to break Rick Johnson's heart. You never give up do you? Like a recurring nightmare. I was thinking more along the lines of pest, but nightmare works. Okay labor day weekend, are you thinking Saturday, Sunday, or Monday? Saturday so we have three solid days to sell. I thought so. Hey, I thought you tore up all our old pictures. Oh, right, well how many girls can say they went to their prom in an ice cream truck? Yeah, sorry about that. Are you kidding? that was the best. You were freezing No, it was the best. Yeah. Mhmm. Hey, you still got that trampoline out back? What do you think? Sweet. This used to be a lot easier. Oh man, I'm too old for that. Yes you are. It feels like I never left this place. Almost. There's 8 million people in Manhattan. It's crazy to think that with 8 million people living with you, you can still feel alone. Do you feel alone here? No, how could I with everyone watching my every move? What does that guy have a GPS on me or something? No, we're meeting the Reverend here. Oh. Councelling. For Rick's emotional shortcomings? Premarital councelling. Oh no. Well, you want me to leave out the back gate? We're not in High School. You're not, I'm not so sure about me and him. Well he probably already saw your bike on the front lawn so. Right. Oh what a treat, it's Rick. You look nice. Thank you. Not you. Did you tip my bike? Nope, looks like you got a flat tire though. Tough break. That's funny, it wasn't flat when I got here. Don't look at me. Well it's hard to avoid it when you seem to show up everywhere. Ugh, I'll drop the artwork off at the printers okay? Thanks Susie. You're welcome, Hi. Come here. Harry. Oh hey Reverend. Looks like you got a flat tire there. Yeah. What are you doing with that toothpick? Nothing. Good, because we don't believe in an eye for an eye. What about a tire for a tire? Turn the other cheek. Right, so Premarital councelling huh? Yeah, I look forward to doing that for you one day. Give it here, come on. I'll see you in church Harry. Still Sunday right? Sunday and every day. Well, that was interesting. I think there's a few things we need to work on. Oh! Rick remember, the key is listening. Got it. What? I said got it. I'm just kidding. I was nervous. It's okay. I gotta go, I'll call you later? Yeah, would you mind dropping this off at the printers for me? According to the Reverend I should say yes. All the information's on the post it, I just called and they're gonna do a rush job for me. Ten to Four P.M. stone park, Saturday Labour day weekend. Got it! See, listening, doing. Yeah, great, thank you. Okay, I am gonna do this, I'm a good boy, I'm a catch, listening and doing. Yeah, listening and doing, you can do this, you can do this, listening and doing. Okay, on a mission, I am going to do this. Susie said you were expecting this, all the information's on the post-it note... Uh, alright it's Stone Park, Labor day, ten a.m. to four p.m. Looks like labor day's on Monday the third this year. See, I'm a listener. These Rocky Road signs are all over town. You know what I don't get? Another card. Why would they have the grand opening on a Monday? I mean it makes more sense to do it on a Saturday, that way you take advantage of the three day weekend. Well there ought to be an ordanace against posting signs on every corner. I don't think so Fiona. Well there ought to be, and you should bring it up at Sunday sermon. Sunday's sermon is love thy neighbour. I'm gonna give Harry a call, it's bad business! I wouldn't play that one. I'm sure Harry knows what he's doing and it's a no talk game Fiona. You seen how much time Susie's been spending with that boy? I don't know what she sees in him. He's a good kid, give him a break. He's a Rose thief, and she ought to stick with that Johnson boy. Let's see how it all plays out. Hahaha. Gin. Told you not to play that card. Oh I wish we were playing for money. Is it delicious? Here try one. Mmm, delicious! Really? Yeah. Delicious. Oh! It's perfect. Really? Really. I can't believe summer's ending already. Yeah I know it went by so fast. Yeah it did. You know where time goes really slow? Texas. Is that so? Mhmm, Cowboy Rick's hitting the trail Tuesday right? Will you be riding shotgun? I haven't decided. Well you know the Reverend says if you truly love someone you don't have to decide, you just know. When did the Reverend say that? Last Sunday at church, I guess I'm winning the pool. Okay maybe I said it. Maybe you just don't want Rick to win. If I hadn't left town would we still be together? I don't know. I do. Don't do this Harry. Don't try and charm me back into this again, because you're just going to leave! You know you are. Okay are we done yet? You know we hit the road tomorrow we gotta be ready, let's go. Are we done? Susie. I think we are. It's fantastic, isn't it Ben? Ben what's wrong are you sick? Am I sick? no, I'm not sick, why would I be sick? Do you not like it Mr.Burk? What? No, the truck is fantastic it's a great job. No I just suppose I'm starting to feel a little nerves, I mean we start tomorrow and I don't want to fail in front of my family. You know dad, no matter what happens, you're already a success. Me? Yes you. You know I've been looking up to these heavy hitters on Wall st. for years, I should have been looking up to you. You're there for people, you're honest, your word is your word, I mean you give away free ice-cream to cheer people up, while your business is going under. Some people say that man's a fool. No dad, that's the kind of man I wanna be. Well thank you son, thanks son. What time is it? Where's your watch? We sold it to buy the grill. Look this is a disaster there's nobody coming. They'll come. We've been here two hours. Hey boss, I mean this is a bust, you think I can take off? Take off Razor, see you later. I don't get it, we did everything right. Maybe we over sold, maybe we just pushed too hard I dunno. How can no one show up? The Reverend, you're friends, not even Susie. I saw her at the bakery with Rick this morning, I didn't want to say anything, she was wearing a cowboy hat. I guess that's it then. Well, We tried. I'm sorry dad, I really wanted this for us. Nothing to be sorry about, Okay let's just pack up the food and let's get out of here. Yo guys, I can't believe I didn't notice this, some idiot wrote Labour day as a Monday. Lemme see this. Check it out. Oh well the food's not going to keep for two days. Razor, smart phone, Stat. I'll Ping everyone with twitter, there is twitter here right? What do you think, we're dinosaurs? Hey dude, look I'm on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Vine, and Kick. Gimme that thing. Okay it's gotta be a good hashtag though. Okay, I got this. Oh Rick. Hey, check this out. Oh my, Let's go. Oh this is exciting, come on everybody, let's go, come on! Hey guys check this out! We gotta go. Huh? Ah, look at this, looks like they're sticking with us after all. Let's get this party Started. Hiya, come on through. Good thing I've got 7000 followers on twitter huh? That 6999 more than I have. Excuse me, could I have your attention please? I'd just like to say a few words. You have no idea how good it is to see all of you. It's funny this truck used to embarrass me, but I guess it took losing everything to find out what's really important. Turns out it's been right in front of me all along, and at the risk of sounding corny, sometimes the best road is the Rocky Road home. Okay form a line here, I'll start taking orders. This is what we got, Cheeseburger on a stick, Tuna? Okay. You did a good job. We did a good job. That was a really good speech, did you mean all that? You couldn't tell? Well you are quite the smooth talker. Well I'm not that smooth or else you wouldn't be going to Dallas. Yeah, well, I'll come back to visit. And I'll be here. Hey, look I owe you an apology. Just one? Look I think I might have screwed up your poster, not intentionally. It's okay. It is? Yeah, I mean we've been trying to let the air out of each other's tires for a while now. That wasn't me. It's okay man, I want us to start over. As what? Friends. Friends? We already have a couple things in common, we both don't like eachother, and we care about the same girl. Well, good luck in Dallas. Take good care of her. I will. Hey, you ever want lawn bowling lessons kid, just let me know alright? You know what Jerry? I might take you up on that. Alright, take care. There we are, we did it. I mean what a day a total sellout, unbelieveable. Hey we'll have to go back tomorrow. Cash and carry? I have to get this. Hey Mr.Price. You're not taking my calls that can only mean one thing right? Who stole you away? G.S.? Not Meryl, Can't have you working for the enemy now can we? So here it is, I'm prepared to offer you your apartment, car, expense account, and your job back, starting yesterday with a 10% bonus. That's very generous, but I'm going to have to say no. Always negotiating eh Harrison? You know you've been like a son to me so I can go to uh 20%. Actually I already have a Father, he's right here next to my mother. We've got two trucks and if business goes the way I think it will, We'll have four by winter and then six, and then one day in the not to distant future, You're going to look out of your hermetically sealed high rise window and see one of those trucks, and A billboard, maybe even a little sky writing, overselling? Not at all. You're going to give up everything for that? That is everything, that's my family. I guess I had you wrong. I had me wrong too. Goodbye Mr.Price, when we go public we'll call you. Alright, I'm gonna need two things: My own place and a new phone. Preferablly smaller than a coffin. I gotta tell you son, I'm very proud of you Harrison. Thanks dad. What do you say we go back to Harry? Absolutely not! What kind of a name is Harry for the head of a company like this? Hey Harry. Tyler my man, what can I get you? Three cheddar sticks please. Aren't you lactose intolerant? Nah, you were right, I was mis-diagnosed. There you go. Thanks. What can I get for ya Fiona? Well I'll have the fish and chips on a stick. Good choice. And uh, stay out of my roses Harry, or I'll take the air out of your other tire. That was you? Pssssssss. Looking good old man. Who you calling old man? Why don't you get back there and re-stock, looks like we're gonna need it. Alright, alright. Harry. I got something for the seniors centre. Please, no more ice cream, we got enough to last us a month. Better than Ice cream, and it won't melt. What the heck is this? Turns out I was over gifting, think you could use some speakers? What HI-FI? Surround sound. Aw thank you very much, that's very kind of you, let's see if I can get that kid of yours to help me carry this thing. The Gotlands are renewing their vows next month, you interested in catering? I'll check our schedule. I'll take that as a yes. I thought you were heading out today! I thought so too. Flight delay? Nope, I got all the way to the airport but, I couldn't do it. I told Rick no. You did? Yeah, I think he was relieved. I know I am. I mean I'm sorry, actually, I'm not sorry, I couldn't be less sorry. So you're staying? Yeah I'm staying. That's great, because I gotta be honest, I'm not over you Susie, and I never will be. I'm not over you either. Don't mind us. Ride with me? Yeah.
