Look, I don't know if you realize who are you talking to, But I swear if you hang up... I'm perfectly aware of who I'm talking to And how delicate the situation is. Okay, so you know I'll be at the door of the ministry In 15 minutes, Waiting for them to open the door for me. Sorry, ma'am, but I don't think we have that much time. Why? Local law enforcement and the Colombian Army Have found your husband's possible location. Is he all right? Where is he? The vehicle assigned to your husband by our company Has a satellite tracking system. Wait, what? So you knew where he was from the beginning And you only mention it now? Oh, not quite. Do you know how much trouble you and your company are in? We're not liable for these events, But we are doing everything in our power. No, excuse me, excuse me! You're not going to get out of this so easily! Ma'am, we don't have time to argue! The most important issue is your husband. Okay. Why do you say we don't have much time? Right. Approximately two hours ago, An army anti-kidnapping unit went by land and surrounded The point where we think your husband is located. I'm personally on a helicopter that'll provide air support. So why haven't you rescued him yet? Over land travel takes time, Mrs. Owens. You have to promise me you'll bring him back alive. That's precisely why I'm calling. Mauricio Yacca's parents have approved the armed incursion, And we have their sign-off for a hostile extraction. You have to promise me you'll bring him back alive. I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't do that, But I do need your sign-off to execute the operation. No, I can't. I have to consult with my family first. Excuse me, ma'am, we don't have time. The team will be on site and in position in 15 minutes. And the sun's about to rise. If that happens, we lose our tactical edge. No, I can't, I can't. Ma'am, I need your answer now. Will you authorize a Colombian Army operation To perform a hostile extraction Of American citizen Mark Owens? Please answer yes or no. I can't. I can't decide that. Do I take that as a negative? I need you to understand I will be forced to abort the operation. Wait, wait. - Do it, do it. - Okay. In regard to your decision, we wish to repeat That our company is not liable in any way And that we are joining the operation as observers. - Is this clear to you? - Yes Mrs. Owens, in the name of our firm, We wish to ratify our concern about... Mrs. Owens? Hello? Hello! Hey, you bastard, leave her alone! Perro. - Where is the key? - What key? You gonna get both killed. Please, where is the key? I don't know about any key. I don't know. What are you talking about, a password or something? I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't fuck with me, man! Where the fuck is the key? Fuck! I don't know about any key, I swear to God! - I'm just an engineer. - No, you're not an engineer. Your friend says that you are the boss. - Who? - Your friend Mauricio! He's not my friend. I don't know what the hell he's talking about. I don't know. I don't know anything about banks. They got into the bank. Mauricio has told them everything. Now they need a fucking key to transfer the money. I don't know! I don't have any key. I don't want to die here. Oh, Jesus. Tell me something. I don't know! You don't know what? You don't know Mauricio? I don't know Mauricio! He's not my friend! I just got here! I'm an engineer. I come here, I help with the refineries, I help with contracts. That's what I do. The name of my company is Owens Company. I'm an engineer! Please tell me something about Mauricio. Mauricio is a son of the owner. He knows more about the bank accounts, About all the information, he knows all that. Just tell him to check it out, and he'll see. Perro. Where is the key? You're gonna get both killed. Please, where is the key? What's your name? Mark. - Mark. - S√≠, Mark! Mark. No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! Hey, fuck, I didn't do shit. Come on. Relax, man, take it easy. - We're gonna die. - No, we're not. Always the right things go wrong with me. Don't be saying that. Why you choose Carla and not me? Why you pick her? I don't know, I can't remember. I should change the color of my hair, no? - Your hair? - Yeah. The blondes have more fun, don't you think? Was she your friend? We worked together many years, so yeah, she was my friend. - You guys are like escorts? - Hookers? I was gonna say escorts. No, no, no. What's the problem to being a fucking whore? I'm sorry. - I just, um... - No, no, no. Have you ever been with a whore? 'Cause last night you were fucking one. I wasn't fucking her. Why's that? Maybe you couldn't get it up, but you want to fuck her. Is it not the same? Jesus Christ. Are you friends with Mauricio? I know him for a year, almost a year. Together we make fun of the other girls Because he like to act like a gringo. I thought maybe you guys were good friends or something. I thought he was full of shit, you know? When he's sober, he's this quiet guy. But when he gets drunk, He's like, he likes to play el gran se√±or. You have a boyfriend? A boyfriend? Yeah, I mean, why not? Why can't a girl like you have a boyfriend? All my clients are my boyfriends. You speak pretty good English. Thanks. Where'd you learn? I took some classes. - Some classes? - Yeah. Why? Don't laugh at me, please. A friend of mine, she get married with a gringo, And I just wake up and say to me like, "I want that for me." What happened? I just ended like a whore. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no, don't be sorry. I don't regret it. Knowing English has given me so much. How's that? Look, all the gringos are coming to Colombia, And you guys rather have a girl like Carla than me, So knowing English give me extra money. So why would you want to marry an American? Every girl in Colombia wants to marry a boy like you. Do you have a girlfriend? Four. You have four girlfriends? Look at you! I have four girlfriends altogether. You only slept with four women... In your entire life? No. I've slept with six. Seven. Do you have a girlfriend? I was married, or I'm married. Are you married or divorced or what? No, I'm married, but I... I don't know what's gonna happen now. I mean... Nothing's gonna happen because nothing happened. - Yeah, right. - Nothing happened, Mark. You know, it just was... The night is good, the meat is weak. Who's gonna tell her? No one. We're gonna die. No, we're not gonna die. How do you know that? Because I know. We're gonna get out of here. Everything's gonna be okay. Now just... Listen to me. I'm gonna take you to the United States with me. We're gonna get the hell out of here, And everything is gonna be fine. I promise. I'm a whore, but I'm not stupid. - I don't lie. - How can you help me? I help people like you all the time. I help people that help people like you. - Are you a priest or something? - No!

Come on, she's the only one that's trying to help me here. She's so nice to you. Come on. If we don't help her, She's gonna be the first one they're gonna kill. What do you want me to do about it, huh? Well, I'm not gonna let her die. I'm not gonna let those fucking bastards kill her. Why do you care so much about her? That blonde girl, Mauricio, they fucking killed her. She told me. She said... She said that they weren't kidding around, They weren't fucking around, that they were gonna kill her. And I didn't believe her, and they killed her. It's my fault. It's my fault she's dead. Who, Carla? She's just a whore, man, a piece of meat. Look, I'm not gonna die because of you or anybody.

I'm practical. Let me ask you something. They asked Vanessa to choose between herself and you. Who the fuck do you think she would pick? Jesus, Mauricio, I couldn't make a decision like that Out here in the fucking jungle. Of course not. You're such a goddamn fucking noble prick. You know what? I don't give a fuck what you think of me. Look... We all know I don't really care what they're gonna do to me. But we've gotta stick together and gain some time. Time? What, are you fucking kidding me? We're doomed! Jesus Christ! They're gonna fucking come here! I got a fucking wife! They're gonna come here! They're gonna fucking kill us!

But there's $60 million in the bank. Everything was okay. They were able to access the transfer bank. They had some troubles at the bank. Now the bank is asking for a fucking confirmation code. We have a deal. What deal? I don't know the password. This is not the perfect moment to play games, Mark. Tell me what the fuck is going on here, man. I don't have a deal with him. Don't lie to me, Mark! - I'm not lying. - Bullshit! You had the key from the beginning. Do you remember putting your jeans on last night? You put it in my fucking pants! It's his fucking bank! Why in the fuck would I have the key on my pants? Do you remember putting your jeans on, Mark? Remember last night while you fucked that 'ho, And she moaned and squealed like a fucking hog? Stop!
