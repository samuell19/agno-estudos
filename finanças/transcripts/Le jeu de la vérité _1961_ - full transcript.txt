The Game of Truth ''The end of everything'' Next. -Your name? -Étienne Bribant. -Age? -35. -Address? -63, Boulevard Argengon, Neuilly. -Occupation? -Company Director. O.K. Next! Frangoise Bribant, 22 years old. I'm his wife. -No occupation, naturally. -That's right, no occupation. Next! Jacques Bertrand Falaise, 34 years. 18, Quai des grands-Augustins, explorer and lecturer. -Next! -Giséle Palert. -Profession? -Dancer. -Address? -18, Quai des grands Augustins. -Same address as the explorer? -Of course. We're engaged. I see. Next! Guillaume Geder, 35 years old. 45, Avenue Henri Martin. Industrialist. Florence Geder, née Aubry, 25 years old. Managing director. Same address as my husband. -Same company? -Obviously. Guylaine de Fleury, Hotel de Fleury. Place des Vosges. -Occupation? -None. Guy de Fleury, 25 years old. Same address. -Are you her husband? -No, her brother. -No occupation either? -No. Solange Vérate, wife of the novelist Jean-Frangois Vérate. -And you live...? -Here. For part of the year. Thank you. -Jean-Frangois Vérate, 45 years old. -The great novelist? Let's just say the writer. And you're the master of the house? I'm listening. My wife and I had invited some friends over, as we often do. A very simple evening, just close friends. We had given the servants the evening off. It must have been about 10 o'clock when I sat down at the organ. My guests had insisted and I didn't dare refuse. The weather was terrible. Believe me, my dear Bribant, plastic is the future. It's becoming an obsession with you. Everything is plastic: phones, cars, planes even ships... When I hear the organ, I feel as if I'm in church. -Do you believe in God, Florence? -In God? I don't know anymore. -And yet you were... -I know, close to death. Perhaps that's why I don't believe anymore. It's too ... obvious! -What? -That you're in love with Frangoise. -In love! You're crazy! -Oh please, you're with me! Save your protests of innocence for the husband. You can't hide anything from your little sister. The bastard! Look at this dedication. ''To dear Bertrand Falaise who often travels such a long way in order to convince himself he's finally arrived '' -- it's nice. Well anyway, I don't want him as a witness at our wedding anymore. He's not your witness but mine. Do you love me? Of course he does. He's told you 1 1 times in the last little while. -Will it be much longer? -It's the end. -It's marvellous, don't you think? -Oh yes, I loved it... And yet, I know nothing about music. That's why you loved it! Guylaine, my dear, please don't start! I think we can say that our host plays better than he writes. What I appreciated was the end of it. I swear! Either you're a complete idiot or a vile flatterer. -I stopped well before the end. -We would never have thought so. I was coming up to a tricky part for the left hand. After all I'm just an amateur. I can't let you get away with that. You moved me deeply! Not to the point of interrupting your business conversations. Darling! The annoying thing about improvisations is that you never know when they're going to finish. The funny thing is, that he wasn't improvising. You've already let me dance to one of your poems. When will I be able to dance to your music? -Darling, please! -I'm sorry, it's not mine! Good heavens, who would have thought it! That's a shame, isn't it, darling? You played us the Toccata and Fugue in D minor of Johann Sebastian Bach, didn't you? -Well done! Who told you? -Your wife, just before dinner. He's honest, isn't he darling? A little sharp, but honest. Tactless most of all! Tell me, Geder, how come you haven't yet thought of making organs out of plastic? Perhaps he doesn't like the organ after all! If you announced an organ recital given by Jean-Frangois Vérate, they would have to turn people away from the Salle Pleyel. Since his last expedition, the Salle Pleyel has been exclusively reserved for lectures by our friend, Bernard Falaise. Oh please Vérate, let's not exaggerate! And to think that I have never been able to hear you. I wonder what you can tell them after so long in Matto Grosso. A lot of horror stories about the sexual behaviour of savages. -But that's very interesting! -It's horrible. Just thinking about it makes me feel ill. Not you? My dear Bribant, your wife is charming. -It's amazing how young you are. -And so pure. -Is that a reproach? -On the contrary. I was joking. You would make a great victim. I know someone who will love it. Do you mean Porkran? Solange, don't tell us that you're expecting Porkran? I am, my dear Florence. In fact he should already be here. Could one say that bothered you? I'm sorry but I just can't get used to that lout. If you had said that Porkran was coming, I would never have come. Me neither. I can't stand him. Why is that, you don't find him respectable? Respectable! Quite simply hateful. I'm surprised. How could you have invited him? My dear Florence. You don't invite Porkran, he forces himself on you. We're delighted to be subjected to him. Guylaine is right. You're all unfair. I find him very amusing. That's not true Solange. You don't believe a word of it. With him around you, you never get bored. -It'll be a change from the organ. -Give me a scotch. I hope you don't intend to play in front of Porkran. Don't worry. It's over for this evening. So much the better. That way he can only attack your latest novel. -I'm used to it. -I thought I was doing you a favour. -It's a joke! -No, not at all. And especially because it seems that he has a surprise for us. Good heavens, I've got the feeling that he'll be ruining your evening! -What surprise! -If we knew, it wouldn't be a one. But rest assured that it will undoubtedly be unpleasant. How do you know? It's very important for Porkran to maintain his reputation. He's the most offensive creature I know. Yes, well I think we would do better to leave now. My husband says 10,000 workers could make a living on what he has. Absolutely. I hate the idle rich, especially those as rich as he... ...I hope he'll turn up impeccably dressed. He doesn't need that. He is so poisonous that if he was bitten by a snake... What do you think would happen, it would be the snake that would die? Good evening. Not very original, my dear Florence. But thank you anyway. No compliment has ever pleased me more. You're listening at doors these days? I didn't dare interrupt you. -Porkran, you're the very devil. -You're too kind. I do what I can! Oh the wonderful little person you have brought with you! I knew you'd appreciate her, being a connoisseur of porcelain. She's quite heartbreaking. Was that your surprise? No, this adorable little face is just here as a tasty tidbit. No, the surprise I've got for you is a real bombshell. -A bombshell! -A bombshell. Don't you know what that is? You, our plastics expert? -You're going to blow yourself up? -Not me. You. -That would have been too perfect. -But a lot less amusing. -I like others living dangerously. -If you're lighting the fuse. What I like about you, is that you have remained so sharp. Nothing escapes you, you always see everything. Well Solange, where's the caviar? I'm dying of hunger. Oh, I'm sorry, Porkran. You create such an atmosphere that I'm forgetting my most elementary duties. Luckily our friend doesn't let us forget anything. Particularly when he's right here. And moreover, I'm late. But what do you want? You only come across bombshells at the very last minute. You too? I didn't know you were a connoisseur in porcelain. The young lady is undoubtedly Japanese? No? From Indochina then? I think our mother was from there. As for our father... you know how it is! Yes, so many people have been through Indochina these last few years. In any case, she's young, fresh, troubling. Only thing lacking is speech! Very fortunately, she doesn't speak, at least not our language. Then how did you persuade her to accompany you? She knows how to recognize other people's money, preferably in large amounts. -Oh I see, she's a pro... -No obscenities, Florence! -I'm sorry, I'm sorry, my dears! -You'll make Frangoise blush. We don't want her to think badly of us. I see that the master has found inspiration again. -How can you see that? -The caviar. You've changed your supplier since ''The End of Everything''. You'll notice that she eats too, but only on command. She didn't know how to use her pretty little fingers for the trivial circumstances of everyday life. Who knows? Perhaps she eats with her feet- let's take off her shoes. Porkran! Does brutality towards simple people repulse you? Why do you think she's so simple? She could be a maths teacher. You picked on the one thing that could spoil my pleasure. The gentleman doesn't like intellectual women? You're well placed to know that, dear heart! And you, Jean-Frangois, was it to please intellectual women that you have called your book... Well, now we're quite satisfied... but a word of advice. Keep enough supplies on hand for later. -Explosions make you hungry. -Still going on about your bombshell? Well, you're really not on form this evening. You're repeating yourself. -If only it was a real one! -Are you kidding! We know how Porkran works. It's never worth much. That's what you say! The one I'm carrying cost me a whole lot. And if I had the talent of our friend Geder for business, I could make 50 or so million from it. -At the very least. -You're really spoiling us! Wrong, Solange! It's myself I'm spoiling. Didn't you know that Porkran never makes bad investments? That's true. But I don't reward myself with money. The looks on your faces is enough for me. You know, this little guy could be quite scary. I could resell my little bombshell for a lot of money. I prefer to have it blow up in your faces -- for free. So, strike your matches and set off the fireworks. No, you young people are always in too much of a hurry. You're wrong. Waiting for something is half the pleasure. That's all well and good, but what should we do while waiting? I could get back to the organ, if you like. -Oh no, don't say that! -So what shall we do? Oh, it's going to end in a game of strip poker like always. I liked that game of yours with the little balls, remember, at Easter? -Oh yes, great! -Not in my living room, children! -We can't have any fun now! -Someone must have an idea. Our perfect hostess has no doubt got something in reserve. Yes, of course. I invited Porkran. But, since he's holding himself for the finale... Then you find the beginning. I don't dare propose the Game of Truth game to them. -Why not? -Because they always refuse. They're not wrong. Those kinds of diversions always end badly. There's no reason why. It's easy to see that you've never played. -Why? Is it gross? -Oh, not at all. Someone asks you a question and you answer the truth. -That's all! -Oh, it's not very dangerous. It is. The world insists on truths which have killed more people than a lot of wars. That's why civilized men invented lies. We would be wrong not to make use of them. Well then it's not worth playing. And anyway it's so exciting to play with fire. Particularly when it's other people who are getting burnt. I love that! -O.K. then, what are we waiting for? -Count me out. Jean-Francois, do you have something to hide? Everyone has something to hide, don't they? -You just have to keep quiet. -If you can. Once this thing gets going, there's no way to stop it. Yes, but it's such a rare pleasure to tell the truth. It gives you the same kind of feeling as being drunk. A feeling, however, which very soon degenerates into collective hysteria. Don't suddenly get all hypocritical, Jean-Francois. You're dying to take part in this bout of collective hysteria. Ridiculous. What pleasure is there in demeaning oneself in this way? My dear Bribant, you're best placed to know, that in spite of popular belief, money allows those who possess it to satisfy all their desires. There's only one thing that money cannot buy. Something as indispensable to a human being as the air he breathes. -And that is? -A kick in the arse. -Not for me. -You're not against it, are you? -You're not wrong, it's stupid. -You surprise me, Falaise. I thought you loved taking risks. When the risk is freely given, what interest can there be? Interest? But it's about danger. If it excites you that much, we could begin with you. I'd like nothing better. Alright, be careful how you answer and, above all, don't lie. In order to be the principal dancer at the Opera, what would you be prepared to do? Certainly less than you're prepared to do to earn 3000 francs. Well done darling, you understood immediately. Your turn, Giséle. Put a question to anyone you like, except me. Alright. Florence, I wanted to ask you why you had married Geder? He's not very rich, or very intelligent. What could there be about him that pleases you? All the rest! What I like about you, Florence, is that you are terribly feminine. My turn to ask a question. Bribant, among all the people who are here, who do you hate the most? Apart from Porkran, of course. -Myself. -Why? Precisely because I am here. Take note, Solange, that I did not say because I am at your house. Subtle distinction. However, you don't have to monitor yourself. The game is the game. -Can I ask you a question? -Please do. You've done a lot to increase the literary fame of your husband. One example? Well, I used to spread the rumour that he was a leftist intellectual. Oh well done! So it's because of you that I fell out with Montherlant, isn't it! Thank you! Oh please, those that aren't playing don't have the right to speak. Frangoise, have you ever loved any other man except your husband? Outside of myself, I can't see who that would interest. But I 'm not at all embarrassed to reply. I was head over heels in love with my piano teacher when I was 8. He looked like Schumann. You didn't ask the question in the right way, Solange! -Too bad for me! -Come on, Frangoise, it's your turn. Alright. Guy, if you had to choose a woman in this room, -which one would you take? -You! Oh, how cute this all is! You can't understand, Guylaine, not at your age. Since you're on form, ask me a question so we can have some fun. Every day I see you with a new girl, even prettier than the last. It seems that you don't even touch them. Is that true? -Ask your sister. -She's the one who told me. Since you love talking about this kind of thing, we continue with you. -I'm ready. -Well then, for once I'll be decent. Just tell us the names of the men you have sinned with. Just the ones who are here, that will save us time. If you want to save time, ask her for the ones she hasn't sinned with. My goodness, apart from the incorruptible Bribant... -And Guy, I hope. -Guy is my brother. -It's not the same thing. -And that's all? Sorry, sweetie, but that's all. Tell me, Geder, you who claim never to hide anything from your wife, I don't think you told her about us. That kind of thing with you doesn't count. In any case, frankly I had already forgotten. Right, my turn now. Tell me, Master of Matto Grosso, do you believe in Giséle's talent? Yes, I'm sure she'll have a great career. He's not talking to you about her career, but her talent. -There's a subtle difference. -I don't see it. He's asking if you like the way she dances. -With me yes, a lot. -Bravo! For a sportsman you got out of that very well. Your turn now. Where have you put that much talked-about bomb? On my heart. You don't believe me? Come here, Frangoise, I need your innocent little hand. Go on, he won't eat you. Don't be shy. Touch my heart. In my pocket. And there we are! -That's your bomb? -It's pretty thin. -But heavy with consequences. -The only thing left is to open it. Wait for the last stroke of midnight. It's essential for the atmosphere. You're keeping us in suspense. I'm managing your pleasure and mine too. -You claim it's worth 50 million. -Not the envelope, what's in it. -What could be worth 50 million? -Silence. -You're not blackmailing us? -Rest assured. I won't sell it. I'm counting on opening it at midnight. -Tell us who it concerns. -One of you naturally. Pay no attention. He's trying to scare us. Don't leave, Frangoise. The game is continuing. I'm going to ask you one little question. Did he have a chance? -Who? -That fool, Guy. If he hadn't stupidly sworn his love for you in front of everyone here. -Did he really have a chance? -Saved by the bomb, Frangoise. -But what's happening? -Nothing. Perhaps the last electricity bill didn't get paid. We can see you're used to that. In a house like this, could it just be the storm? The wiring is so rudimentary here that it takes nothing at all to plunge the apartment into darkness. It's not that unpleasant. On the contrary, don't you think, Guylaine? You see, I'm not like you. I don't need darkness. In any case, it doesn't stop us playing. Wait a minute, truth needs light. How right you are. This game is like love, it's essential to know the effect on our partner. As for me, darkness suits me very well. For both? Dear Solange, always so careful. Oh it's not carefulness, on the contrary. -In the dark, you can take risks. -We could perhaps play now. -Alright, Vérate, a little courage. -We're dying to get going. -Where were you up to? -The bomb which saved Frangoise. -So we're letting her off? -That's the game. You have to be a good sport, Florence. OK, then. Frangoise, your turn. It might seem stupid to you, but the smell of candles makes me think of death. Are you afraid of death, Florence? I'm mostly afraid of what will happen afterwards. Does it bother you that much to leave your fortune to your husband? It's Frangoise who's asking the questions. In any case, I've already answered. My turn. Bribant, my husband is ready to make all kinds of sacrifices to get you into his plastics business. Will you play along? Since we're talking about serious things, my reply will depend on his. Why are you so ready to do all this, Geder? -Because I need capital. -At least that's frank. I always put all my cards on the table in business. But your company has substantial funds. -It's not his company, it's mine. -There, now you have your answer. -Whereas, I'm still waiting for mine. -It's no. Your turn, Geder. Porkran, don't you get tired of only doing evil? You're afraid that I'm tired? You're right, I'm going to have to start contributing to good causes. How much do you need for your plastics business? Good heavens, I must admit I hadn't thought of you. You were right not to. The answer's no. -Bastard! -Thank you... Let me continue. Your turn, Giséle. Try to understand. Last year, you asked Vérate's permission to make a ballet out of one of the poems from his younger days. -Had you read it? -I was obliged to... Obliged is enough for me. Giséle, I adore you. You're trying to make me say that only Vérate's name is worth anything. But if his poem was as bad as that, why did he agree to give it to me? Oh, because I fancied you. Does that still happen to you? They don't amuse you, do they? I understand. In your country, you are much too wise, much more civilized. You avoid taking part in such entertainments. I have to tell you that I'm getting tired too. As for you, if you were simply to bring me a glass of water that would give me a lot of pleasure. Luckily, there are still people like you. Right then, Falaise, your turn to play. -Vérate, do you feel any remorse? -What about you? -So, they have a secret. -They must tell us what it is. Vérate, take advantage of the power failure, it won't last long. -It's too long. -It doesn't usually last this long. Perhaps this power failure isn't in the neighbourhood. So, Jean-Francois, give us an answer. What's your secret? Or Betrand Falaise's, if you prefer. You can see that we're being very elegant in giving you the choice. My dear, a secret has no value unless it remains a secret. Oh no, you're cheating! -There. -Saved, my dear! Elegance! While we're waiting, I have a question for Porkran. Porkran, if I really asked you to give up the idea of opening the envelope, would you do it? -Well, Porkran, are you asleep? -He's pretending not to hear. -Porkran? -What's the matter with him? It's too easy! -What's the matter? -Porkran, aren't you well? Has he ever had any health problems? I think so. He has a heart condition. We should do something. Absolutely not. If it's a heart attack, the slightest movement could be fatal. -We can't leave him like this. -Solange, call Doctor Dupuis. -Should we make him drink something? -Be careful though -- no alcohol. Water. -I'm calling Doctor Dupuis. -It's useless, he's dead. -Did he commit suicide? -In my house! Have you ever seen anyone shoot themselves in the back of the head? -He definitely had a revolver. -What revolver? -Nobody heard anything. -With all the noise that there was. With a silencer, a shot can easily pass unnoticed. How could an accident like this have happened? It's not an accident. It's murder. -Where are you going? -To call the police. The police! In our house! Why not journalists too, while you're at it? I don't see any other solution, Solange. Vérate is right, it's a police matter now. Hello, operator, this is the 234 at Beaumont-le-Roger. It's horrible, I can't look at him anymore. No, operator, me neither. I can't hear you. Beaumont-le-Roger, Villa Orphélie. -Help me, Guy. -Let's not stay here. Come on! It's always the same thing! For once that the phone could actually be useful. -Isn't your line working properly? -It's the storm. And on top of that I got stuck with a complete dope, who couldn't manage to get me through. So, we'll have to go to the police station. No, she did at least promise to do what's necessary. She'll be the one to let the police know. It could be a long time. Not as long as if we went ourselves. Well then, since we can't do anything else -- let's just wait. Wait here, with a murderer who could perhaps be in the area! -Not perhaps -- definitely! -What do you mean? It's elementary -- no-one came in and no-one went out. Even so, surely you're not going to suspect... It's not just suspicion, the evidence is there. The murderer is inevitably one of us. One of us? But you don't know what you're saying. Unfortunately, it's absolutely logical. Well in that case, he could start over. Don't be stupid! Nobody here would have the courage to commit a crime. I know each one of us too well. -You claim to really know everyone? -Oh yes. -And her, you know her well? -It's true that she's not one of us. We don't even know where she comes from. -Yes we do --the gutter. -And a foreigner too. -Foreign or not, we'll make her talk. -You're wasting your time. Those people never admit anything. You're right. -We'll have to search her. -Certainly not! You disgust me! You really are such cowards. What's got into you? You know very well that she had nothing to do with it. You're right, Vérate, I agree with you. If there's anyone here who would not be interested in that envelope, -it would indeed be this young lady. -What envelope? The one that Porkran threatened to open at midnight. That had something to do with one of us. You can't have forgotten. So, someone would have killed Porkran to stop him opening the envelope? Well anyway, we can check what's in it right now. Be careful, it's in your interest not to touch anything. Why? Nobody has the right to remove material evidence. I never intended to make anything disappear. Then let the police do it, that's what they're there for. You can't even approach the victim. They could accuse you of wanting to muddy the trail. Right. What's up, Giséle? Giséle, my darling, what's the matter? Nothing. -Would you like me to take you home? -No, it's not worth it. I think it would be better. Come. You're trying to run away already! -Not very sporting of you. -I'm taking Giséle home. I don't see what's so strange about that. Excellent pretext for leaving without waiting for the police. And cutting short troubling questions. Oh, it's the enquiry that's bothering you? -Oh well, don't worry. I'll be back. -You'd better be, really. -You don't believe me? -You never come back to face danger. -What are you trying to say? -Nothing. You've gone too far, Vérate. Now you have to go all the way. I really don't want to. I don't find your presence here indispensable. You can go. No, Falaise, you can't. Neither can you, Giséle. I know it's painful, but we're all obliged to wait here for the police. -We can't stay, watching the body. -Yes we can. I think it would be better not to leave Vérate alone with him. What are you saying? It wouldn't be the first time that you've dared to rob a corpse. And on top of it all, you're accusing me! However, I'd rather be in my shoes than in yours. The corpse that you're talking about, is not on my conscience. -Not on mine either. -You let him die. You didn't try to do anything to save him. Vérate, who are you talking about? About his friend on the Matto Grosso expedition. Yes, this gentleman who passes himself off as a hero was cowardly enough to let a friend die without offering any help to him. The only thing I could have done would have been to die with him. I didn't have courage enough to do that. Yes. Well, it's a matter between you and your conscience. But how is this relevant? Well, the real author of ''The End of Everything'' -was precisely that young man. -That's not true! Did I bring you his manuscript, yes or no? I don't deny it, but I completely transformed the draft you brought me. That's the only reason it got published. You didn't change as much as a comma. I don't understand, Falaise. If your accusations are true, why did you wait so long? You should have intervened as soon as the book was published. He was afraid that Vérate would blackmail him. It's obvious. Giséle, your hero is just perfect! And to think that I was going to sacrifice my life to him. Compromise your career, you mean. Of course, that's the only thing that counts for this little darling. Her career. That's all I was there for. It's not likely it was for anything else! A little decency, Guy. I think we've all forgotten something. The game of truth is over. It hasn't even begun. Just wait until we open Porkran's envelope. It seems difficult for me to see how we could sink any lower. Unless it concerns you. -Why not you? -Why not everyone? That's right. Yes, when the police get their hands on that envelope... There are those who will be sorely embarrassed, If only it was useful. How can it help the police to poke their noses into our private lives? Yes indeed, all it does it un- necessarily complicate the enquiry. Since everyone agrees, all we have to do is burn the envelope. I don't agree. You don't have the right. We always have the right to avoid a scandal. Those with nothing to reproach themselves for, don't fear a scandal. -You seem very sure of yourself. -Yes indeed. But you could also be seriously embarrassed. Me? Your wife mysteriously disappeared last summer. What if we asked why? I would answer that it's nothing to do with you. Which lets us imagine all kinds of things. That she ran away for instance. That's not it. It was what's discreetly called an accidental pregnancy. What? Frangoise doesn't want children. In any case, I know she was in a clinic. A detox clinic -- not worth looking any further. -You are revolting. -Drop it. Obviously it's easier to say nothing. Well speak, Frangoise, speak. You'll give these bastards too much pleasure. You won't tell them. Too bad, I'll tell them then. She wanted to commit suicide. It's true. It's a secret that wasn't worth 50 million, Mr. Geder. But, tell us, Guy -- how come you're in the know? At the last moment she was afraid to go and buy the pills, so I did. You got them for her? Well done! You knew about it and you did nothing to prevent it. I'm all for the freedom of conscience. In my day, when you were in love with a woman you bought her roses. Now you bring her barbiturates! Geder, all the same, I think that it's more honest to help someone who wants to die than someone who doesn't. Isn't that right, Florence? You know you would be wrong to torture yourself with remorse. In any case at the moment, both of them are here in perfect health. He would make up anything at all, that little bastard. -I'll make you swallow your lies, -Geder, not here. I'm sorry, Solange, I was joking. In any case, I'm wondering why I'm bothered by him since there's not a word of truth in what he says. A word of truth? Guylaine, just tell them. Didn't Geder promise you that his wife was supposed to die? That he was just waiting for that to happen so he could marry you. Please note that I'm not blaming you for getting better. I'm really grateful to you for that you got rid of this bitch for me. -Once again, Geder, please... -I'm sorry, Solange. But Porkran was also having a hard time with her. She's not behaving very well, the poor pathetic thing! With Porkran she was the one having a hard time. Well obviously, I'm jealous of everyone. Please... Don't try and make us believe that you were liking all this. You hated Porkran. You know me! As long as it brings in some money! But that's just it, it didn't bring you in enough. That's why you tried everything you could to get me to get divorced. -Divorced? -Yes. She wanted to push her little degenerate brother on me. I'm sorry I couldn't sleep with you. I wonder how you can? He shuts his eyes and tries to think of a thousand franc note. Ladies and gentlemen. The police! Let me introduce myself, inspector. Jean-Francois Vérate, the owner of this house. -Where is the victim? -In the smoking room on your left. Inspector, you must know whose house you're in. On the contrary, Madam, I don't. Come with me. Don't mention it. -Has anybody touched anything? -No, of course not. -Good. -Perhaps we were wrong. In any case, it's too late to stop them now. There's nothing else to do. We have to agree on what we're going to say to him. It's a bit late to be thinking about that! As long as Vérate doesn't say anything. If a scandal breaks out, it have repercussions on all of us. So what shall we do? First of all, be quiet. That's the most important. -They don't really know anything. -But we have learned a lot. We've certainly got too much on Guy. When it was just between us, it didn't matter. But now, not a word. It's not always easy to keep quiet when you're being questioned. Leave me alone and close the door. -What's going on? -Nothing. -What's he doing? -The usual verifications. -What did you tell him? -The least possible. It took a long time. You didn't tell him about the envelope at least? -He'll find that on his own. -But then, he'll read it. That way you'll know too. Are you trying to tell us that you already know? In your place, Geder, I wouldn't insist. -Did anyone touch the body? -No, no-one. Yes they did. -Who touched it? -The Chinese girl. Remember? The glass of water. Come here. -She doesn't understand. -She's pretending. Shut up. She wanted to give him something to drink. She didn't touch the envelope. The envelope? Well, speak up. -That is to say... -I'll go. No. I will absolutely not allow it. Hello, yes, yes, it's me. No, because I'm telling you no. Understood. Thank you. This must come from your last reception? Caviar! -So, what have we decided? -Nothing, we're waiting. -What about that envelope? -It's not of any interest. -Are you sure of that? -Quite certain, Inspector. It has nothing to do with the death of our poor friend. -I don't share their opinion. -Quite honestly, neither do I. If you really think that it would be enough to open the envelope to find out the name of the murderer, it's quite easy. Not that easy! The envelope has disappeared. -What! -We knew it! We should have suspected. The murderer took it. Don't take yourself for the examining magistrate, my friend. So, we mustn't lose any time, inspector. I rather think that this helps me gain some. Right then. Let's get back to this envelope. But there was absolutely nothing in it. My husband is certain. Right? You understand. He knew Porkran very well. That man had only one pleasure -- fooling his friends. And this evening, as usual, everyone went along with it. You want me to believe that this man was killed for an empty envelope? My husband claims... I don't claim anything. Until the end of the enquiry, I do not need you to speak for me. You recognize then that this envelope had some value. 50 million. It was Porkran himself who told us that. In that case, it's quite clear. -Blackmail, refusal to pay, murder. -Obviously, it's classic. So we just have to find the person who took the envelope. -Has anyone left? -No-one. All right. -I'm going to search you. -Oh no! That's certainly not legal. Are you asking for us to be treated like common people... I have asked you not to speak for me. You don't need to speak. You need to obey, that's all. Come on, empty your pockets. Absolutely not! Would you like me to help you? I advise you not to try. -You don't have all the rights. -I'm taking them. -That could cost you dearly. -Perhaps, yes. But meanwhile, you're going to empty your pockets and be quick about it. Understood? Very well, but I will have warned you. -The rest of it. -That's all. You don't have any money, papers? Because I'm at home. Would you like to check? Certainly. Allow me. Go over there. Undoubtedly new methods, you are going to have some serious problems. The man is simply doing his duty. Ours is to make his job easy. -Thanks. -At least you are reasonable. Keep going. If anything seems suspicious to you, tell me. -Anything? -Or anyone. Is the search over? Yes, for the moment. -Very well. -Bravo, Bribant. Always ready. -You were outstanding! -Your turn, Come here, you. A New Year's card, a new packet of chewing gum... ...4,300 francs... You're all witnesses. A St Christopher medal... ...and three raccoons. And that, as a little something extra. -Nasty brute! -He shouldn't have provoked him. You two together. It will save time. -He can't treat us like this! -Those three are really wound up. That will encourage them to be well behaved. OK, enough. OK... Come on, your turn now. -You won't allow yourself to... -I'm giving myself permission. Women can only be searched by women, it's the law. -I'm the law here. -We'll see about that. I'm going to contact your superior immediately. Certainly not! This is 234 at Beaumont-le-Roger... That's enough now. Come on! A policeman would never behave like that! What proof have we got that he really is from the police? Will you shut up! Hands up and turn around! Come on or do you want me to shoot? I'm warning you, I don't have any time to waste. -Go and get your purses. -That's a policeman? -You haven't quite caught on? -You mean, he's the one who... Will you make up your mind? They're on the sofa. Admit it, you bastard, you're the one who killed him. Because you're not a cop. -Are you going to answer us? -Go get fu... -Have you calmed down? -I'm sure he'll tell us now. You can go to hell. You still don't want to say anything? -We can keep going, you know. -Admit it, for God's sake! Yes, yes, it was me, yes. How did you do it? I was outside. I shot through the window. Why? I'm asking you why. It's not up to us to interrogate him. Leave that job for the police. -I'll call them. -He cut off the phone. There's another extension in the hall. If I were you, I wouldn't call the police. We'll hold him. Hello, operator, it's the 234 at Beaumont-le-Roger here. Put me through to the Police station. Yes, yes, I want to speak to the Commissioner. It's Mr. Vérate. I'm warning you. If you give me up to the police, I'll tell everything. -Who are you trying to scare? -The person who paid me. What! Yes, someone paid me for killing your friend. I'll say it again, Commissioner, he was the one who answered the phone. Yes, we're holding him. But I'm telling you we're holding him. -For killing Porkran. -Perfect! I'll be waiting for you. That would suit you nicely, wouldn't it? You don't know what would suit us. You killed him because someone asked you to? Exactly. I'll say it again, someone paid me for killing your friend. What are you saying? Who paid you? -No idea. -You must tell us his name. His name? -Where are you going? -I'm thirsty. Let him be. Thank you. You haven't answered. His name? When you don't know who you're killing, how could you expect to know who paid you? It's too easy to accuse without any proof. Proof? These banknotes. Do you think I cut them in half for fun? Well then, someone should have the other half of these notes. -Yes... the mailman... -The mailman! That's a bit too easy! It required some thought! And this guy, do you recognize him? With a plan of the house with all details down to the location of the junction box Here. -The junction box? -So, he cut off the lights. Cut off before and put back on after. It was planned. Like that, in the dark, Porkran's death wasn't noticed. And someone was able to take the envelope without being seen. Come on, let me go and we'll never speak about it again. Ever. There is absolutely no way that will happen. If the cops take me away, I won't go alone, I'm warning you. Who does he take us for? If one of us paid a killer to commit this crime, no one will ever know. You're ridiculous, Bribant. The guilty person can't be here. -Why, because it upsets you? -Think about it. You think he killed Porkran so that one of us could steal the envelope. That's right. So, why did he come back to look for it? -Well, give me an answer! -It wasn't part of the plan. I had to kill him, that's all. Then why were you interested in the envelope? -Because it was worth 50 million. -How did you know that? I was behind the window when Porkran told you. And after killing him, you risked coming in here? Risked? There were 1 1 of us to give your description. I was armed. To think that we took you for a cop. Bastard! Drop it. This guy is valuable. He could send one of us to the guillotine. Who could have wanted Porkran's death this evening? That's right. Why precisely one of us? I'm convinced that that envelope concerns one of us. -What do you know about it? -Well the evidence points to it! -We have to make sure. -How? Now that the task is half-completed, let's keep on going right to the end. If you continue this search, I'll oppose it. Why? My dear, you've all been searched. -Out of respect for our guests. -Considering where we're at! -You can't make us do it. -I'm not forcing anyone. Each of you is free. In any case, I don't want there to be any doubts. Frangoise, your purse. -He was trying to escape -You fool! He threw himself at me, I was afraid and I shot. In any case, he asked for it. All he had to do was keep still. -I feel I'm living in a nightmare. -What can we do? Wait for the police, that's all. -What'll we tell them? -The truth. He took a huge risk. Guy had to shoot him. Force of circumstances. We're all witnesses. We're going to have some dreadful problems. Yes, particularly now that it's over. We'll never find out anything else. In any case... Charge: murder. Penalty: 5 years in prison. You'll forgive me for not crying, for not protesting. I don't feel the need to justify myself. I committed a crime, it's true. But I paid dearly for it. If I hid it from you it's because I thought I was done with it. When you're 16 years old. When all you did was defend yourself from an old bastard, believe me, 5 years in the reformatory should be enough. It was to prevent me from finding out that you tried to commit suicide? I didn't want them to make you pay for it too. Right. Now, I'm asking you not to say another word. I'll get you a lawyer. The best. I'll take care of everything. Those are the most romantic words you've even spoken to me. But I don't need a lawyer, Etienne. I had nothing to do with Porkran's death. -But why deny the evidence? -I swear to you, it wasn't me. But I found the envelope in your purse. -But I never touched the envelope. -Come on, Frangoise! Perhaps someone else put it there. I don't know. I assure you it wasn't me. -But you knew it was about you. -No, no I didn't. Frangoise, please. You have to face facts. Everything accuses you. Everything. But you can see that all I want to do is help you. So why are you still insisting on lying to me? Since she's telling you it wasn't her. I took the envelope. -Are you sick or what? -I put it in Frangoise's purse. You were all around Porkran. No-one noticed. Not even her. And you want to make us believe that she knew nothing about it. Frangoise knew nothing. Absolutely nothing. Who would you have stolen the envelope for, if it wasn't her? For myself. I needed money. You got paid to get yourself a killer? Frangoise had nothing to do with it. I wanted to sell off the envelope. And you made her a present of it for nothing, without anyone knowing. You're taking us for idiots. I didn't know it was about her. I only found out when I opened the envelope. So, you would have paid a killer and constructed this intricate plot for an envelope whose contents were unknown to you! I knew it was worth a lot. How did you know that? From Guylaine. Porkran didn't keep any secrets from her. And it wasn't even in order to save Frangoise. It was just for money that you had a man killed. As for him, he wasn't even trying to escape. You shot him down in cold blood, so that he wouldn't talk. -You have no excuse. -You know what's waiting for you? And not even the slightest mitigating circumstance. Guylaine! You can't even act like a man right up to the end. You're not going to let me be punished in your place. It's all that you deserve. You shouldn't have tried to trick me. But why didn't you tell me it was about Frangoise? You knew I wouldn't have played along. Because you thought you were in love, poor fool. Look at her. She doesn't give a shit about you. Shut up. She'll get you out of it, your Frangoise. It's what you wanted. Shut up, please shut up. They'll be happy, they'll have lots of children. Good for us to know on execution day. It's your fault. I told you we could never get the 50 million. But you, you would have done anything at all for money. It's all you ever thought about. Luckily for you. But you could have gone on being a kept woman just like always. And what about you? Has it never bothered you to sponge off your sister? Would you rather I had sponged off Florence? You couldn't even manage that. You really are just pathetic! A failure! A loser! Because of you. I hate you! But as for me, I love you! Guylaine! Don't be afraid, my darling. I'm here, I'll see to everything. Translation by Nocturne
