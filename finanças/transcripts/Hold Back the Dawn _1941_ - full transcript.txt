I'd like to see Mr. Dwight Saxon. Saxon? Shooting "I Wanted Wings" on stage 5. What's your name? Iscovescu - but I don't think he remembers me. - You haven't got an appointment? - No. - Mr. Saxon is shooting. - It's very important. I can't call him on the set. Write a letter or try another time. Next! Are the ladies and gentlemen from the Seattle Kiwanis all here? - Sure are. - Then we can start our tour of the studio. This way please. Let's begin with the buildings, then take the laboratories, the permanent sets, and so on. Then wind up at the restaurant where I'll try to point out some stars. You can't make it the other way around? - Horace! - I'm hungry! Quiet down, here we go. - Ready? - Yes sir. Right, roll 'em. Quick. Ready? Alright, action! Hello Jeff, why haven't you called? I've been busy. You can't be so busy can you? There's a dance tonight. It's just a small party, our last night at Randolph. I can get away early. I thought we'd been all through this. I thought we were going to be intelligent about it. What does that mean? Goodbye, good luck, we've had our fun? You go your way I go mine? Don't try and sell me that routine! - I wish I could think up a better ending. But I can't. You drop off at my place after that dance or I'll start making a few plans of my own. I'm expecting you. Cut! That was a good one. The second and the last. - Second and last. - The script? - Here it is - What do we do next? - Lunch, if you ask me. - Who's asking you? It is 1 o'clock. Ok break for lunch. - Lunch one hour, boys. - Come on. - Boys. - Watch out. Come on, let's go. Mr. Saxon? Could I talk to you a minute? Yes, what is it? We met in France, in Nice, at the Perroquet, remember? Yes, how do you do? Mr. Saxon, I need 500 dollars. - You what? - 500 dollars. I must have it. - Isn't that a little large for a touch? - This is not charity, for that money I have something to sell. - Yes? What? - A story. We have a Story Department and we have a lot of stories. You haven't got this one. Leave it in the office with a self- addressed envelope. That'll be alright. Excuse me, I'm not a writer. I would not try to tell you that story if I did not need the money. - I understand, but some other time. - No, I must have it now. Before the federal police take me. Police? What do they want you for? That is part of the story. Please, I have very little time. Ok. Sit down I can't tell you the real names, you understand? - Yes - My name is Georges Iscovescu. I was born in Romania, but I have lived mostly in Paris and in Biarritz. - Thank you. - At the Lido, following the seasons. Going where rich people went. Rich women, to be exact. Thank you. My papers indicate that I am a dancer. Which is correct, in a general way. It was an easy life, if you had a deep voice and knew how to look at a woman But the war came. People with money made for America, and you need a visa to enter, and there was a scandal in the press about me and a lady from New York. so I thought I better not apply for a visa where they might know me, I thought it wiser to get in more discreetly so I went to Mexico, to a little town that straddles the California border. There is a wire fence, you can see through it to the U.S. if you're American or have a visa you just walk in. Yes, a wire fence. But don't let them tell you it's only 12 feet high. It's a thousand miles high. The main street is called Calle Ruiz. It looks like you'd expect, a small, sleepy town, baking in the heat. You can stand anything for a day or two, I thought. There is an American consulate where you can apply for a visa. I knew there were some formalities to be met before I could cross the border, but my papers were in order. I had a little money, I felt very confident. I see that you wish to enter the USA permanently. Yes sir. That will require a quota number. - Do you know what a quota is? - No. Every year, the US permits the entry of about 150,000 immigrants. That number is proportioned among the various European countries. You were born in Bucharest. So you come under the Romanian quota. Yes? The Romanian quota is very small and is very crowded. Does it mean I have to wait? Between 5 and 8 years Mr. Iscovescu. Between 5 and 8 years? 5 to 8 years! Like a prison sentence. 8 times 365 days with these flies and this heat. 8 times 365 nights in this place. I was used to the Ritz and the Savoy. One of the local hotels is called the Esperanza. The rate is a dollar a day, cheaper by the week. But you'd better take your room by the year if you can get one. They're all taken. Crammed with people that are waiting....waiting. I had one stroke of luck that day, however. There was, let's say, an unexpected departure. A man named Wechsler. What's the matter? Maybe you can recommend another place to stay? Just a moment. I will have a room for you. Just wait. So the German moved out of room 27 and I moved in. I did not expect to stay long, I thought some lucky chance must come my way. Somehow I would get across the border. Five months later I was still in room 27. And my nerves were in such a state that the hook on the ceiling seemed to be beckoning. Mr. Iscovescu. Mr. Iscovescu. - Mr. Iscovescu. - Yes? It would give us great pleasure if you would join us. We are celebrating in our room. What are you celebrating? American Independence Day, July 4th. I don't think so, I have nothing to celebrate. We're serving all American dishes - Boston baked beans with donuts. - Thank you. - With donuts! Yes, thank you very kindly. But no. - Father, your coat. - Yes The guests will be here any minute. - What's going on here? - I beg your pardon? The name is Hammock, from the Immigration Department in Washington. - Father. - How do you do? - What's your name? - Van Den Luecken. Professor Van Den Luecken, and these are my daughters. - You're waiting for your quota? - I've been waiting for 8 months. I thought you were new, otherwise you'd know me. I come once or twice a year to look certain things over. I see. - Boston baked beans? - They permit us to cook in our room. Maybe we have no right to hang out the flag. - With a slice of salt pork? - Of course. I was always a sucker for Boston baked beans. Then perhaps you would join us? Mrs. Kurz. How are you? - You've taken on a little weight. - Temporarily. - Isn't it lovely? - Congratulations. - Both of you. - Thank you. Thank you very much, we call it Opus No. 1. Mr. Hammock. When did you get here? Just today, I've been looking for you. - Any news about my immigration? - No. I need a haircut and a shampoo. That's why he keeps me this side of the border, - So I can do his hair. - Shall we eat? On this 4th of July, let us all say grace for what we are about to receive. Better still, for the great country which is about to receive us. God make us truly thankful. And for Mexico, that is sheltering us while we wait. And for Mexico. Do not let us be impatient, let's always remember the words on the Statue of Liberty. "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." No, you are referring to the words of Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence. What I meant was a simple poem inscribed on the base of that statue. The beans, father, please. "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores. Send these homeless, tempest-tossed, to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door. " Or is it the shining door? I'm afraid you've got me there, professor. - Well... - Now we can eat. Are you going to the bullfight, senor? Oh, is that what they've come for? They always come when there is some saint's day in the States. A little whooping, a little fiesta. I need a dollar. Put it on the bill. No more money for you, You owe me two months rent and 39 dollars. 40 is easier to remember. You said 25 was so easy, too. Did I? Thank you. Who did that? I said who did that? - It was me. - You mean "it was I," Tony. It wasn't you, Miss Brown - it was me! I'm not very proud of you, Tony. Would you mind coming over for a moment? Now Tony, you've behaved outrageously and you're going to apologize. Throw that thing away! I'm so sorry. Thank you very much, Madam. No, please, the boy must apologize. It's a matter of discipline. Your form of humor I don't appreciate. You know what American boys are like. They store up mischief all year long for the 4th of July. I think it would be better if they let off their high spirits in America. Under the feet of Americans. Let's not get into international complications. You see, there's a fence back there. You Americans make a very definite point of it. I gather you don't like us very much. Very little. Shall I apologize now, Miss Brown? Don't you dare to! - You can't drink out of that, there's a hole in it. - A hole? Who says I can't? I'll keep my thumb in the dyke. - Tequila. - Yes - You can not drink in the shoe. - Leave him alone. - Give me my slipper please. - I'll drink out of it. - Well, Joe... - Will you leave me alone? - Where are you going? - To ask for a tune. - Look. - I did not know he danced rumba. Play "La Cumparsita", will you? Georges And now we present the dance sensation of the Riviera, Georges and Anita. - Anita! - And you! Stop staring George, it's me! I'd say it must be; you're still using too much Ecstase # 9. I saw the back of your head, it's different from the back of any other. You mean I need a haircut? I'm silly, the sight of you is still like touching a high-tension wire, After all these years. After that last goodbye of ours. The casino at Cannes... an abrupt goodbye, I remember. Very - slapping my face in the middle of the Baccarat room. You behaved like a fool, we were doing alright. You had that rich baron, the one with the glass eye, and I had Mrs. Sweeney. - Canned soup Sweeney... - There was plenty enough cigarette cases in that soup. You had to step in and spoil everything. I simply said: "Alright Mrs. Rich Witch, just because I'm his dance partner and because you have a lot of money... " Maybe it wasn't the right way to talk to a paying customer. Good to see you, just the same. Come, let's sit over there. What are you doing here? I came from Los Angeles with some people, those drunks over there. It's not the same Anita, Georges. It's not the same Georges. Have you seen my watch? From Cartier's to a Mexican pawnshop. - That's my story in brief. - You're living here? - Waiting to get across. - Hotel Esperanza. I served time there. That's right. You are Australian. Vaguely... my father was Polish and my mother Australian. How long for your quota? Whatever it was I didn't wait that long. How did you get in? Meet Mrs. Shaughnessy. I married an American. - And what? - Very simple. If you're married to an American you get preference. When your papers go to Washington everything is settled in 4 weeks. You mean you can become a American citizen in 4 weeks? No, but you get into the country. Three years before you become a citizen. Anita! Where are you, Anita? - Your husband? - No. No. Shaughnessy was a jockey from Caliente. Five foot three. Once over the border I went to a judge. I said a woman wants a man, not a radiator gam. - Divorce granted, 50 dollars. - Very smart, Anita. I haven't been very smart since. Did anybody see anybody that goes with this? - You'd better go. - Let him wait. It'll only be an imitation fur jacket. All those years, with all the others, I shut my eyes and thought of you. I want to keep them open once again, Georges. You better go. - What goes on? - It's alright, my great big bull. - You know that guy? - C'mon, give me my slipper. - Whose little torero am I? - I won't let these guys steal my girl. What did she say? You just marry an American, as easy as that. From 5 to 8 years for idiots maybe. Get hold of a wedding ring, and you can swing right over that fence. Just get into a good suit, shave, go on, go ahead! What do they call it? The pursuit of happiness? This is the day - the town full of Americans. Most of the women had escorts, of course, but there were enough alone, enough clay pigeons for a sharp shooter. You may think it was cold-blooded, calculating, the act of a cad perhaps? But on second thought I'm sure you'll realize that my intentions were entirely honorable. Object: matrimony. - Bravo! - Madam, sit down. Close the beak! Bravo! She was the eager, enthusiastic type. I told her about Spain, about Seville, and the bullfights I had seen there. She was easy to impress. You know I'd like to listen to you all day long. Really I would. All day long. Thank you, madame. Especially the Madame, that's what gets me I think. - Really? - Well, here is my car. Perhaps we might have a drink at the village? I don't think I'd better. Wait a minute. Clarence. Maybe we can, he's asleep. - Who? - Clarence. He can't stand the sight of blood. He almost fainted. - Your husband? - Yes Maybe we can take your car? I'm sorry, madame, in Europe we respect marriage. - Clarence! - Yes dear? I met some other American ladies that afternoon. But the sharpshooter seemed to have lost his eye. They were not clay pigeons. All they wanted was a few hours of fun. When you go serious, they fluttered away. Yes, the day was wasted, It would be a long time before another holiday brought American tourists over the border. C'mon darling. Pass. - It's time to go home. - Come on, come on. We're going home. Come on, come on. I was very depressed, but on my way back to the hotel... A bomber! And you too, Sam. I told you to sit down with the others. Can't you give me some idea how much longer it'll be? Soon. But you promised that it would be done by 3 And then he swore that it would be ready at 5 There were three holes in the radiator. But you tore the motor all apart. She was flooded. We had to dry her out. - What did you say? - You are making us nervous. Nervous! Good evening. Still with us? I know you don't like us, but we'll get back over the border as soon as we can. No Please. I am partly responsible for this. - I feel very badly about it. - You should. I brought the children to show them a fiesta in Mexico, hand-weaving how they make pottery. We've been sitting here in this awful garage all day. - Give me my hat or I'll shoot ya. - The children are as cross as two sticks. Are any of them your children? No. I'm a schoolteacher. And I'm responsible for them. They'll be in a perfect tizzy about us back home. Yes of course. Their parents and perhaps your husband? Oh I haven't any husband. And if we don't get back by 9:00 p.m. Mr. MacAdams, the Principal, will think we're all dead in a ditch. While you wait, why not telephone him and tell him you're alright. - They say there isn't any telephone. Yes, at the hotel. - Yes? - Just across the street. - May I show you? - You will? Just a moment, please. Children, I'm going out for a moment and I want you to behave. How long is "soon" in your language? Soon? 20 minutes. Keep on with it. There you are. Oh I say, better keep this out here. That won't do. - Sam, I want you to be monitor. - Yes, Miss Brown. Ray, hand me my bag, the gloves, please, and my coat. - Yes, Miss Brown. - Thank you. I'm ready, Mr....? - Georges Iscovescu. - I'm Miss Brown. - Come on, let's go. - Yes let's go. Flores, we want to telephone. - What is the number? - Azusa, California. 30991. That is not cheap, it is long distance. - Flores... - 30991, Azusa. That firecracker this morning... Maybe I should be grateful to your pupil now. I hope they get that call through right away. You should see Mr. MacAdams... He always bites his nails. And I'm afraid he's chewed them right down to the knuckles by now. No thankyou, I don't smoke. The school board doesn't approve. Tell you the truth I don't like them much. - May I ask you something? - What? Will you take off your hat please? - My hat? - Yes, your hat. I want to see you without it. - What an odd request - Doesn't the school board approve? I don't think there are any regulations about it. Well? Amazing. - Your name is not Margot? - No, it's Emmy. She had the same hair. Only it was always messed by the wind... ...that winter in Saint-Moritz. Who are you talking about? You thought I was bitter when you first spoke to me on the street. It's because I saw another woman in your face. Margot. Of course, those are not her eyes. Hers were bad. I had to run away. I had to come here, to the end of the earth, to Know that I really hated her, that I had always hated her. I am sorry. Just look at me, Miss Brown, Keep looking at me. It's like a sudden breeze on a stifling day. Azusa 30991 is on the telephone. Yes. Yes? Who is it? Oh yes, Mr. MacAdams, what is it? Oh, yes. I called to say that we had an accident. No, not really an accident. It's just that... Yes, Mr. MacAdams. I will drive carefully. No, not one bit over 30. What was that? Yes, I'll look out for drunken drivers. Yes. Goodbye, Mr. MacAdams. I do appreciate you going to so much trouble, thank you very much. Not at all. - The car must be ready by now. - Yes I want to pay for the call, I think it was just... No. I am in your debt. But there is no way I can pay you for the loveliness of these few minutes. I thank you, Miss Brown. You're the strangest man. Perhaps the loneliest man Miss Brown. Miss Brown. Parad. This has been this one! I will show you. - What's the meaning of this? - He spit in my face! Oh Tony! Why did you do such a thing? He twisted my arm. - Why? - Because he stole the gasket. - I didn't touch it. - We didn't see it. - We didn't it. - What is a gasket? The gasket. Do you know English? The rotor, the distributor. - On our car? - It was here, we tried it. - Is it important? - The car will not run without it. Boys, this is serious. - Did any of you take it? - No, Miss Brown! - We didn't. - It wasn't us. - Did you look everywhere? - Did we look everywhere? Yes. - Can it be replaced? - Sure, we have to get it on the American side. - Well, that's alright then. - Tomorrow morning, at 8:00. When they open the shop. That's impossible. Ms. Brown is very anxious to get home. We can't spend the night here. The car will not run! - Maybe we can find another car? - No, that would never do. I cannot leave the bus here, it's school property. Very well, Miss Brown. Flores, we are having guests. - Who is having guests? - Oh I can't spend all night here. - We can't. - Of course you can. - In the room next to yours? - It's out of the question. - It's gone anyway, I rented it this afternoon. - We'll find something. I will not let the children out of my sight. Not for one single second. Of course you won't. You can sleep here in the lobby. There are enough chairs and couches. - Flores, get pillows and blankets. - That sounds like fun, Miss Brown. - Who will pay for that? - It is important. - Come on. - Children! Children! Can't you take one off another car? - But not that size. - Or make one up. Make one up! Have you ever seen a distributor? - No. - No. She's a little thing about that size. Twists like that, turns like that. With wires to fit like that. - It looks like... - About this size? Yes, similar. Maybe a little bit bigger. Because if it were smaller in that case... Come along down. Here you are. Well, I guess we're all settled. - Goodnight. - It's better than good. Somehow these walls will not seem so empty and sad because you will be here very close to me, breathing in the same night. Yes. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - No Please. - Goodnight. - Give me that. - I got it. Hello, Georges. What are you doing here? Your door was unlocked. I came to borrow a cup of sugar. - I thought you were with some people. - I walked out on him, Georges. He wanted to buy me a pair of earrings. Suddenly I couldn't stand being with him another minute. I threw a bowl of chili right in his face and ran. - Was that very wise? - Who cares? Georges. I've taken the room next door. What do you want? I've been thinking about you all day. How you used to hold me away from you when we danced. And in the gigolo eyes of yours, cold, selfish. Haven't you ever loved anybody in your life? I want you to go, Anita. Georges You're wasting my time Excuse me. If we were in the States together we're a team I wouldn't mess things up again. I'll get you across the border somehow. There're still good seasons in New York and Florida. I'll get a lawyer, maybe we can fix it up. I don't need a lawyer now. I'll scrape together some money. I've got a few things I can sell. I'll give you anything you want. - Anything? - Anything. - I'll take this. - What do you want that for? I can use a wedding ring. She had a hard time going to sleep that night, Miss Brown, and it wasn't just the children. Her heart was beating fast and her neat, tidy senses were all torn out of gear. She found a kind of half-sleep at last, Then, about 5:00, she opened her eyes. What is it? What are you doing here? You have no right to be here. Of course I have no right to be here. Nor to sit watching your face learning it like a poem, no right to listen to the stir of your heart, no right to tell you that I love you very much. You must go away. Right now. Please. You needn't be afraid, Miss Brown. Not a bit. You see we are like two trains halted for a moment at the same station but we're going in different directions. We can't change our course any more than we can hold back the dawn. All that connects us is a foolish little part lost from a motor. It's getting light already. Soon they'll be waking up, shops will open and you will be gone forever. It is getting light, isn't it? - Please don't come near. - You needn't be afraid, Miss Brown. Not of a dead man - I am dead, you see. I've asked myself thousands of times why they shouldn't bury me, why I should go on breathing, talking and walking when I was dead. Perhaps I know now. Maybe it was to see the sunrise once more To hear enchantment in a woman's voice, to feel her nearness, the warmth of her lips. - Oh no. - You needn't be afraid. It's like a classroom isn't it? The pupils and the teacher. With rules of deportment, schedules and discipline. You're very conscientious, Miss Brown. No infringement of the regulations for you. No rebellions nor violent desires. If you found one in your sober little mind, you would tell you to go and stand in a corner, wouldn't you Miss Brown? I do not know. Not for you the sudden flash that lights up your whole life, one split second to snatch at happiness before it's dark again. It's not this kiss I want, It is all your kisses, your life. Look at your hand, Miss Brown. No, the left one. Yes, it's a wedding ring. I put it on your hand as you slept. It was my mother's. You see how wild a dream can be? But you are wise, and sane and cool. You needn't be afraid, Miss Brown. Please don't walk so fast. Thank you very much. About your being lonesome. Other people are lonesome too, so lonesome they almost give up waiting. Mr. MacAdams always said I was crazy, but I knew deep in my heart that someday, somebody, somehow, even though Azusa was at the end of the world... She talked and talked... I had thrown some crumbs of romance before her hungry heart. The trap was set. She never had a chance. We had to get the Mexican judge out of bed, the ceremony was brief, the office rather dismal, but to Emmy Brown being there was like standing at the altar in a cathedral, with great bells ringing. I always expected to be married in the marvellous memorial church in Azusa - You did? - I never dreamed it would be so beautiful and exciting as this. My they'll be surprised back home. Mrs. Georges Iscovescu. Or is it Iscovesco? Iscovescu. I don't even know what you are. Rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief? Well poorman now, but I have plans for when I am in America. You know, some business connections - I hope to get together a little capital. - I see. Have you thought of the family when we arrive in the station wagon the children, you and I. Unfortunately, I will not be able to go with you right away, my dear. - You won't? - No, not for four weeks or so. Why? I am a foreigner, I have to wait for my visa. 4 weeks... You mean you'll stay here and I... - You can come down. - Oh how can I? We're all tied up with summer classes and I'm terribly busy. Well, it's only four weeks. Well, perhaps it's for the best. I'll have a chance to break it to them gently. Georges, where you come from doesn't the bridegroom kiss the bride? Oh but of course, my dear. Mercy on us, the children! - Stop it at once! - Stop. He has tried to catch me. Only to kill him senorita and make sausage of him. Look at my hotel. Boys I'm heartily ashamed of you. Heartily ashamed. I shall have to report you to Mr. MacAdams. - He will deal with you. - Let me deal with them. Don't give me a tip, just let me deal with them. - Is the car ready? - Yes, she's ready But I would I could fill her up with rattlesnakes. - How much do I owe you? - 10 dollars. Boys, go out to the car, sit down and try to behave. - Yes, Miss Brown. - Sure. Thank you. I will punish Tony when we get back home. How, senorita? I'll make him go kneel in the corner. On broken glass. I beg you, on broken glass. Telephone for you, senorita. - For me? - It's been ringing all morning. It must be Mr. MacAdams, I didn't call him back last night. Hello! This is Miss Brown speaking. Put him on please. Hello, Mr. MacAdams. Yes, we are alive. The car didn't get ready, but we're on our way. Starting right now. No, nothing, really only, Mr. MacAdams, I got married. Mr. MacAdams? Mr. MacAdams? Operator! Please send somebody over to school number 2. Something has happened to Mr. MacAdams. Yes. I think he's fainted. Thank you. You see we were kind of engaged. = Oh? Miss Brown! Georges... It's awful to have to go away. Well, what must be must be. You will write won't you? - Yes of course. - So will I. You won't be so lonesome anymore. Promise? - Oh, no. - I won't either. I'll have this. Please, Georges, Will you put the ring on my finger - And say the words? - The words? For richer, for poorer, For better, for worse, with this ring I thee wed. For richer, for poorer, For better, for worse, with this ring I thee wed. Till death do us part. Till death do us part. Don't come out with me. Please. Come in! Hello. What happened? It went alright. Well! Congratulations, bridegroom. It was two or three days after Miss Brown, or should I say Mrs. Iscovescu, had gone back home on her half of this curious honeymoon, a hot July day with thunder in the air... - Madeimoselle, Monsieur Bonbois. - Hello. - Teacher. - Ah, Mr. Iscovescu. I have an official letter to write; I was wondering if I could borrow your typewriter. - Yes. - But I see that you're working, I'll come later. No. I'm practically finished. Only I warn you that the semicolon broke off. In the heat of the Battle of Saratoga. - I'll make my sentences very short. - Good We understand you are to be congratulated, Mr. Iscovescu. - Am I? - The wife of the judge, Who let me do her hair, tells me that you got married. - Yes I did. - Our best wishes. - Thank you. - I think I caught a glimpse of the bride this morning. - She's very smart. - This morning? No. My wife is not here. Thank you. But in the next door is not your wife? - I'll bring it back in half an hour. - Take your time. That is my cousin. Excuse me. About this great-great-grandfather of yours, where did he live? - In Nantes. - In Nantes? I remember in my family papers: "Jean Bonbois, Boulanger, Nantes". - With a big "B" or a small "b"? - I do not know. If it's a small "b" it's a baker. If it's a big "B" it's a name. Where are your papers? - On the way back from Washington. Why? - Is it important? - Important? My dear friend, Bonbois Boulanger was the son-in-law of the Marquis de Lafayette. - Yes? - If it's a big "B" you are a direct descendent of Lafayette. - Then I'm a Marquis? - Better than that. You are an honorary citizen of the USA. - Honorary And can I go back? - Any time you want. My! - Marriage certificate enclosed. - Do not go so fast. And that you, as an American citizen, birth certificate enclosed, are applying for the entry of your husband. Emily Agnes Cecilia Brown. And so young! - Look at that birthdate. - Well. Well her letter certainly showed it. How did you like that bit about the eyes? What eyes? Wait. "There's one thing I didn't tell you, beloved. I just couldn't. You said you liked my eyes. You might as well know Georges that when I read a long time or correct papers I often wear me glasses. " Shut up. "Four more weeks, darling. Mother is fixing up the spare room for us. The scrap of chintz in this letter is what she's going to use for curtains ...if you like it". How do you like this for curtains, Georges? it's all rosebuds, Georges. That's enough. I think my wife is wonderful. I couldn't have found anybody any better. She leaves me alone, doesn't she? I write her a few letters. I call her from time to time. - And once I cross the border... - We'll be on our way to New York. With a small stop in Azusa, half an hour. Long enough to tell her that the love was too great to last, a mistake that was too lovely not to have been made. That she was too good and you too low. Half an hour, Anita. She'll brush off, like a drop of rain. You swine! The large envelope, it must be the large one. Calm. Stay calm. It's it. It's it. - Good Morning. - Good morning, inspector. - What room does Mrs. Kurz have? - Number 24 I think I've got a crisis of nerves, Professor. - What's the matter? - My papers they've come back - from Washington. - And so? - He thinks I haven't got a chance to get in. - You bet I do. How much? - 10 to 1. - Your 10 dollars against my 1 dollar? You've got it. - Well - open it. - Sure. Open it. I can't. You open it. Good morning, Mr. Hammock. What is it, Mr. Hammock? - About our immigration? - Yes Bad? We can't get in in time so I can have the baby there. I just ran into the Immigration doctor. But he said I was in fine shape. It's not you, it's him. His lungs. They can't let anybody in with... Tuberculosis. I thought you could break it to him. Oh please, yes. But not now. Now while he's so worried about me... Whenever you think. Mr. Hammock, does this mean we can never get in? - Sure you'll get in. When he's better And he will be. - Berta. - Come on. - Berta, where are you? - Out here with me, Mr. Kurtz, having a little chat. You know I've got quite a crush on your wife, Mr. Kurz. "Grandfather Grandmother. Great-grandfather great-grandmother". - Here it is. - No no no. Do not say it Do not say it - Bonbois! Bonbois! - What happened? Now Anita had a superstition, she said the letter to Washington needed a drop of champagne for good luck. Or maybe she just liked champagne. Start with champagne, it'll be champagne all the way. I hope it will be a better vintage. It will be. Only the very rich will get a crack at Georges and Anita. - We will be very expensive I'm afraid. - They can deduct us from their income tax. - You'll make a wonderful deduction. - And you. - Hello, Mrs. Shaughnessy. - Hello. - Do you remember me, Mrs. Shaughnessy? - Of course. The name is Hammock. This is Mr. Iscovescu. Mr. Hammock is from Washington with the Immigration Department. Is it someone's birthday? Don't worry, I brought my own. It's a surprise to see you this side of the fence, Mrs. Shaughnessy. A gal who couldn't wait to hug every stripe and kiss every star. All 48 of them. You see, Mrs. Shaughnessy and I are old friends. I was here when we had the honor of lowering the bars for her. - A cigarette? - No thanks. - How long are you staying this time? - Two or three days. Just making sure the old gate is still here. How is your husband, Mrs. Shaughnessy? Fine. I bet him 2 dollars the day he was thrown at Santa Anita. - I'm sorry. - Is he still in a cast? I really don't know, Mr. Hammock. You mean you don't know if your husband is in a wheelchair? We're divorced Mr. Hammock, it's about a year now. No. Not really? You mean it's gone? That beautiful love match? I really loved him then. Sure, sure. Only once he got you over the border you found you didn't like the cut of his nose. Well if you insist, I will have a little of this stuff. I'm not saying anything Mrs. Shaughnessy. You made the grade - in is in. Only there's been an awful epidemic of marrying up and down the border lately. We finally got our eyes wide open. No kidding any more. The department has a new theme song: "Is it love or is it immigration?" If you forgive me, I must be leaving. We both must be going. No, you stay. I have to see someone. - Yes? - Yes, that woman about the chintz curtains. - It was a pleasure, Mr. Hammock. - Goodnight, mister. Chintz curtains? Emmy. - Emmy. - Yes, Georges. - Open the door. - Just a minute, Georges. Wait a minute. You can come in now. - I wasn't expecting you. - I know. Look. "Congratulations Mr. & Mrs. Iscovescu" Georges! Georges! Mr. MacAdams is so nice. He's gotten a substitute teacher from Riverside, he's given me the week off, and I can use the car. Isn't that lovely? A honeymoon for a wedding present. And look what the class gave me. Isn't it perfectly beautiful? And this is from mother to you. It was father's. - That's where I cut my teeth on it. - It's very kind. And this is for you. I mean, for us, to start out on. - What is it? - I saved it up for a postgraduate course for high school work. I won't have time to take a course now. - I don't want any money from you, Emmy. - Oh Georges. Please! - No no. - It's ours. Community property. It's the law in California. And this I bought for myself. Only it's really for you because you didn't like the other one. I bought it in Azusa, but it's an importation from Los Angeles. She said I could wear it like this. Or maybe a little bit further over on the face like that. - You do like it, Georges, don't you? - I never saw one quite like it. Oh thank you, Georges. Well, let's cut the cake. It was a perfect madhouse back home. Nobody could believe it. And the questions they asked. How it happened, who you were and what you did. I had to make up a lot of the answers. And you ought to hear how they pronounced our name: Isci-bitski and Whiski-whiski. - You have to put your hand over mine, you know. - Do I? Did you see what the kids put on the station wagon? Do they do that in Romania? Everybody laughed at me all the way down. It's been soaked in port wine. Mr. MacAdams says it's worth getting married just to have a bite of it. Not now. I must tell them to make up the room. Now there are two of us. - Let me have the key to your car will you? - Yes dear. I'll park it in the alley. Police regulations, you know. - Alright, Georges. - Thank you. Oh it's the square one. NEWLY MARRIED GOOD LUCK, SRES. ISCOVESCU Well here he is again. Hello. - How did it go with the chintz curtains? - Alright. It looks as if we have some honeymooners in our midst. - Evidently, yes. - What do you know? The old Esperanza cutting in on the Niagara Falls trade. Well, we've got a bowling match on the American side. - Goodnight, Mrs. Shaughnessy. - Goodnight. I'll be seeing you. Goodnight Mr... - What was the name? - Iscovescu. Oh yeah. I'll be seeing you. - She did seem too good to be true. - Staying for a week, too. A nice week to pick with Hammock in town. - You'll have to send her back. - How? Or take her away before Hammock runs into the pair of you and starts asking questions. - I can answer any questions. - Oh you can? For instance why you didn't mention you were married to an American. and all that happened a little fast, didn't it? What does she know about you? And isn't it a little unusual for a bridegroom to be sitting in a bar kissing Mrs. Shaughnessy? Who also married an American to visa herself over the border. - Shutup. Where can I take her? - To Santo Tomás to Guadalupe, I don't know! You've got the car. There's nothing more natural than a little wedding trip. What's the matter? Is she so unattractive? Goerges, what did you do with the letter to Washington? Oh, here. Mail it. And here's some money. - How come? - Never mind. Let's see... I owe 180 dollars to Flores. Pay him. And get the things out of pawn. - 500 dollars? - And anything you need. Yeah. Oh this is like old times. Good luck. No. No, no, no. Your hotel is filthy. Filthy! Look at those towels. And that? You call that a mattress? Do you think I'll have my wife sleep on that? No, I don't want any others. Filthy, filthy. What's the matter, darling? This place is horrible. I won't let you stay here. - Oh I really don't mind, Georges. - No. Pack your things, Emmy. I'm taking you away. This place is for cockroaches, for despair. This is no place to begin our lives. - Georges... - Oh dearest, these few days they gave you, Please, don't let us throw them away here. Quick! Pack your things. Oh Georges, it's raining. - I love it. - So do I. - Where are we going? - Oh, anywhere darling, anywhere. Follow the road. Any road. Wherever it leads. Maybe to a lake or a palace with all the windows lighted. Maybe to a little fishing village with nets stretched out in the wind. Did you ever notice how things talk sometimes? Listen to those windshield wipers. Together. Together. Together. - Can you hear it? - Yes I thought I'd take her to Santo Tomás, a matter of 50 miles. Two or three hours at the most. But in the night and the storm I must have taken a wrong turn. There was no one to ask. It did not matter. I drove on and on. My only thought was of Mr. Hammock and the way I had slipped from under his nose. Whose cake is that? They left that on the table, senor, when they went on their honeymoon. No good letting it spoil. - Mr. and Mrs. Iscovescu? - Yes. And it's got cherries in it. - Who did he marry? - An American young lady. He met her the 4th of July and on the 5th they got married. - You have a piece. - Yes Such a good cake. Of course I didn't know what was happening at the Hotel Esperanza. All I knew was that my foot had gone to sleep on the gas pedal and my hands were numb from holding the steering wheel. Around 11:00 the sun came out and we seemed to be approaching some village. What is it, Emmy? I thought it was a funny noise for my alarm clock to make. - Where we are, Georges? - Back of an oxcart. Where are they going? It's their patron saint's day and they're having some kind of celebration. What saint is it Georges? Whoever is the saint of brides and bridegrooms. - Brides and bridegrooms. - Yes. They're being blessed in the village. Oh Georges, that's the dearest thing I ever heard. - Yes? - All this time not telling me where we were going. Georges, you are wonderful! Thank you, Emmy. The name of the town was Coloya or Colonia, I'm not sure which. But the whole place was filled with young Mexican couples and with the sound of bells and laughter and with desire. I bought her a cheap little Mexican scarf. The mariachis were playing. There was a kind of curious primitive magic about the place. It got hold of you and carried you along with all the rest. In the afternoon, the parade started for the church. Georges, please. Give me 10 cents. - Just 10 cents. - Yes, of course. Come on, Georges, please come on. They won't mind. Anybody can do with a little blessing. Et benedictus fructus ventris tui. Sancta Maria, Mater Dei. Pray pro nobis peccato rebus nunc et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen. Amen. Benedictio Dei omnipotentis, patris et filii et spiritus sancti descendat super vos et maneat semper. Amen. Dominus vos benedicat. Dominus vos benedicat. Dominus vos benedicat. Dominus vos benedicat. Dominus vos benedicat. Dominus vos benedicat. May God be with you, neighbors. There was a foolish legend about an olive tree outside the church. If a married couple shook it, however many olives fell, they would have that many children. This must be their golden wedding. He says they got married yesterday. - What did he say? - He asked if they could adopt one. This one is Joshua, after my father. And this one is Helen. Because that's what I wish I were named. Oh I hate 'Emmy'. And this one...Georges, what was your father's name? - Gregor. - Gregor Iscovescu then. Mother was so foolish. She thought we ought to change our name to Ingersoll or at least to Ives. And I said why? And she said, for your children. Nobody would think of going to a grocery store by that name or to a notary of public called Iscovescu. And I said: "Nonsense! There will be a doctor Iscovescu, a lawyer Iscovescu, a chief justice, a governor Iscovescu. This is America. For the Rockefellers and the Joneses. For the McGonagalls and the Frankfurters. For the Jeffersons and the Slivinskys." You see? It's like a lake, clear and fresh, And it will never get stagnant while new streams are flowing in. But your people are building pretty High dams to stop those streams. To keep out the scum, Georges. Don't you see? Now in Azusa, when they learned that I had married a foreigner, There was only one person who said anything nasty about you. And that was Mrs. Bigelow, who runs Ye old Pilgrim Tea Shoppe. She said: "I suppose he's just one of those foreigners coming with empty hands to grab from America everything he can." But Mr. MacAdams put her in her place. He said: "I suppose your great- great-grandmother was Pocahantas." - Funny? - Very funny. She's just jealous. You see, her husband ran away from her the first week she was married. Georges? You do speak French, don't you? - Yes - I just thought that you could make a nice living in Azusa teaching French. But I suppose you'd like to go into some kind of business. There are plenty of opportunities. It's an up and coming little place. The fastest growing town between Los Angeles and San Berdoo. People coming and going and building and selling and making... Well you know why we call it Azusa? Everything from A to Z in the USA. I suppose I could sell quantities of brushes with this accent of mine. Oh I don't worry about you, only for one thing, Georges. - Yes? - You smoke too much. Thank you. Not in front of the children. I don't quite know how to say it. On that hot July afternoon it was like kissing fresh snow. I could feel her hand trembling on my shoulder. From the church behind us came the breath of incense. Of course there was nothing like an inn in the village. Most of the people slept out in the woods. We had the bus and we got some sarapes to make ourselves comfortable. It was a clear night starred with great stars. She was humming some little tune perhaps so I would not hear her heart beat. Mine was beating too. Well. There are no more, Emmy. Will you get me my dressing case? Well. I guess that's the threshold. So it is. Well... I'll only be a minute. It'll give you time to go to the kitchen to see if I turned the gas off. Fine. I love my husband very much, Georges. Thank you Emmy. She loved her husband very much. I kept seeing her as she knelt in the church. And I thought of a room in Azusa, the one with the chintz. And the day I was to tell her it was all over. The day I was to cast her overboard because she couldn't fit in with my plans. Wasn't that enough? I had no right to touch her. I had no right to involve her. I wanted her to be still Miss Brown when I left her. That's why I did the trick about my shoulder. - Georges? - Yes, Emmy. Just putting in my suitcase. - What is it? - Quick! The hand-brake. Pull it, will you? Oh Georges, what happened? Are you hurt? When I put in the suitcase it must have hit the brake. - Are you hurt? - Just my shoulder. I've thrown it out. It has happened before. - Well let's take your coat off! - Don't touch it, please. It is a nerve, you know. - It's twisted over. - I'll put a compress on it! No I can't move it to take off my coat. Let me sit here with my arm up. If we could just drive somewhere and find a doctor. Oh no, not over these roads. No I'll be alright. Go to sleep, Emmy, will you? If it hurts too much, you blow the horn. Promise? Alright. I'm so sorry, Georges. Isn't it a devil though? The next morning we drove to Tabutayo, where I pretended to have seen a doctor. And down to San Miguel. It was the third day that we started back along the Gulf. It was very hot. Over 100, I should think. She kept talking about a United States about border dam, and how her brother went to school with a very famous man by the name of Joe DiMaggio, and what the FHA is and what the word 'swell' means. That's exactly what she was, swell. There she goes, yelling for a drink again. Oh-oh. No more water. - There's plenty down there. - Saltwater? - Will she take that? - Well if she doesn't, she won't get anything. Georges! I could not resist. It's like lime freeze. - Keep your back turned, Georges. - Alright. My hair's sopping. Bring me my scarf. I'm like a cucumber in an ice-box. Feel my cheek. - Georges, your shoulder! - What about my shoulder? It was the 13th of July. The last day of Emmy's vacation. But we were still not back. Liebchen, he's here. Her doctor is here. - What? - Are we too late? And where is the baby? No, what is all this foolishness? - You should be in bed, Mrs. Kurz. - She won't even sit down. There's no need. - What's that, Bertha? - I'm going out. - Going out? - To buy our dinner. Bertha. She fainted, doctor. She fainted twice. I fainted on account of the heat. The time is getting very close, Mrs. Kurz. - I think we'd better move you to the hospital. - Oh nonsense, doctor. We have an agreement, my baby and I. It's going to be born in the USA. Yes. But the papers don't come. Well, if the baby is willing to wait, I guess we can. Well, goodbye. If you care to stay for some coffee Josef will make it for you. Goodbye, liebling. - Well, how about some coffee? - Alright, let's have some. Thankyou. - I am sorry, doctor. - It's alright, my boy. That was the shortest 100 miles. Couldn't we drive around the block just once? Could you make a mistake and think that it is tomorrow you are due back in Asuza? July 13. Parent-teachers meeting in the auditorium at 8:00. - Sounds very dull. - I have to, Georges. Mr. MacAdams would be savage. - How long to Azusa? - 5 hours. Well. In that case I think we better leave your suitcase right here and get the rest. Hello. How are you, Mrs. Kurz? This is Mrs. Iscovescu. - Hello. - We heard about you. Lots of luck. - Thank you very much. - Thank you, Mrs. Kurz. - Hello, Flores. - Glad to see you back. See that this gets to my room. And let Mrs. Iscovescu in, please. Darling, while you pack I'll let them fill up the car and get the salt water out. Georges, you don't suppose that if I went to the American authorities and talk to them they'd let you come with me? No darling. Three more weeks. Regulations. I could ask them how they'd like to be without their wives for three weeks. I have seen their wives and I am afraid they'd like it very much. - Georges. - Hello Anita. Honey I thought you'd never come I've been dying here day after day looking down the street watching for your car. - Bad news? - Good news. Two offers. One the Casanova of New York and the Savoy in Chicago. Both for the first of October. We'll take New York. As for Hammock, not a word. He's in Tijuana. Flores is paid. Your things are out of hock, and if we need a little cash for immediate expenses... Don't look, but right in back of me Mr. Elvestad, a big diamond man from The Hague, just arrived the other day, tried to rent a whole floor. Might be good for a little wardrobe. New tails for you and a couple of dresses for me. We have to be ourselves before the 1st of October. - Not the 1st of October. - We can make it. Out of here in three weeks. Plenty of time in New York to brush up the old tango. - I'm not going right down to New York. - What? Oh the stop over in Azusa. - Well that'll be half an hour you said. - It will be however long it takes. But we had it so simple. She was too good. You were too low. I'll do it my own way, do you mind? How, the slow way? Wait till the first of November or December? And then comes Christmas? And jingle bells and the family standing around the Christmas table? Do you like the girl? Yes. I like her enough not to give her a sudden kick. Not to slap her face in front of her whole little town. I like her enough to do it all with a little style. Alright, I like her enough not to behave like a swine for once in my life. - Well, Hallelujah. - That will do! You've got enough money to get you back to New York. I'll find you there when I'm ready. Thanks. You just stand right in the middle of Times Square and whistle. Come in. - Mrs. Iscovescu? - Yes? Funny, I just didn't picture you looking like that. You know. When one hears about a school teacher... I am Anita. I don't suppose Georges told you about me, did he? No. No, he didn't. - Are you in a hurry? - I have to get back this evening. Good. But before you go, there's something of mine I want you to give me back. - Of yours? - Yes. My wedding ring. What would I be doing with your wedding ring? You're wearing it, I think. You see I loaned it to Georges. This? - It belonged to his mother. - Isn't he wonderful? He certainly knows how to pluck at a heartstring. You see, I gave him the whole idea. What idea? About the marriage. And let's give him credit. His execution was brilliant. - He sees you, cuts off your retreat. - What? - You remember the 4th of July? - Yes. - Why did you stay overnight? - My car broke down. A part was lost. He kicked it down the drain to keep you here. He only needed a few hours. I don't know what story he told you. He varies his repertory. But by the time your car was fixed you were safely married. Why this is insane! He married me because... Yes, he married you He married you to pass that gate. For the same reason that I married my little American and with the same ring. Just take a look inside at the engraving. "To Toots, for keeps." Go on, look at it. - No. - Maybe you'd like me to tell you a little more about the history of Georges Iscovescu. Get out. Please. Please. The first time I heard of Georges I was in Ostend. Lady Whitwood and her daughter both tried to turn on the gas because of him. - Hi there, Mrs. Kurz. - How do you do, Mr. Hammock? - Anything wrong? - Oh, no. It's so hot. - I'm just on the way to the market. - What's going on at the hotel? - The Iscovescus back? - Yes, this afternoon. That's neat. Now you take care of yourself. That sun's bad. Yes. Hold it, lady. - Anything we can do for you? - I'm coming to see Mr. Hammock. - He just passed through. - I know. I talked to him. He said to wait for him in the office. - Okay, lady, go on in. - Thank you. - Howdy? - Good afternoon. - Quite a spell of heat we've had, Mr. Iscovescu. - Yes Got me a new tie the other day. Kinda loud, don't you think? Delicious smell of tamales they always have in this lobby, don't they? - I want to speak to Mrs. Iscovescu. - Upstairs, senor. - Get her. - Now wait. What is it, Mr. Hammock? I just want to talk a few things over with your wife. If you don't mind. If there are any questions - I'll be glad to answer them. - It's your wife I want to hear from. You just sit down here and keep quiet, understand? - Go on, get her. - Si, senor. I know what you're thinking: "This woman is a tramp and she's in love with him." Well I am a tramp and I am in love with him, for years I've loved him, just as you do. Only there's this difference: I'm his sort. I'm dirt but so is he. We belong together. You think you're a teacher - why you're a schoolgirl that's learned life out of a book. You'd have learned this lesson in 6 weeks or 6 months. I'm telling it to you in 6 minutes. Get away! Get in your car and don't come back. Yes? - You are wanted in the lobby. - Who is? - Mrs. Iscovescu. - Who wants her? - Mr. Hammock. - Who? He's from the Immigration Department, he's gonna ask you a lot of questions. Don't go. Don't see him. I'll be right down. Take my bags, please. You can't give him away. What for? What good'll it do? I learned life from the school book, remember? Do you know what I'm going to do if I ever win the sweepstakes? Buy me a gold earspool with a diamond handle, the best, to dig out all the baloney I have to hear. - Emmy! - I'll handle this. Right this way, Mrs. Iscovescu. Have a chair, please. I have no right to bother you with any questions not down here in Mexico. It's just that if we think an American might be getting a dirty deal... - I'll answer your questions, Mr. Hammock. How long had you known Mr. Iscovescu when you got married? A few hours. Isn't it kind of rash to marry a man straight off like that? Yes. Had you any idea that he was waiting to get into the country? Yes. And that he might have married you to turn the trick? He might. Okay. Now if you just take the trouble to start scraping the varnish off Mr. Iscovescu A lot of interesting things come to light, for instance... The way he made his living and that he was involved with a lot of women? And one particular woman right here in this hotel. - The dancer? His partner? - Ok. And that once in America the two of them were going to team up again. Now look here Mrs. Iscovescu, anybody can see the setup with half an eye. He asked you to marry him with the express purpose... You're making one mistake. I asked him to marry me. Alright. He got you to ask him to marry you. Look, Mrs. Iscovescu, you can make things very simple for the Department. With this evidence you can get an annulment. It's a cinch. That'll slam the door right in his face. - Get what? - An annulment. An annulment? How do you like that, Georges? That's America. You pay your taxes but you get a lot of protection. No, thank you, Mr. Hammock. It's very sweet of you. But you see there's nothing wrong. He told me everything. There were no false pretences. You people are always looking for plots and traps. It's a fine marriage. I am sorry for your sake, but you haven't got a case. We love each other very much. I'll be the doggondest dog of all doggone dogs. Maybe I'm just dumb. Emmy, I have always been full of words you know, big ones, fancy ones, Just one more word: - Thanks. - No. You see, I come from a small town. We don't have any of those fine hotels, we eat at the drugstore. But we leave a tip just the same. I don't think I've been too generous for those seven days. Only perhaps, when I first met you, I shouldn't have been so vain. I should have looked at your face more closely. Goodbye. Hey. Did you forget that lady that's waiting for you? - What lady? - That Austrian one from the hotel - She says that you told her... - Said what? Where is she? In the office. - American? - Hello, there. Pass. Help! Help, somebody, help! - Haven't you heard me yelling for help? - What's wrong? Get a doctor, boil some water. Get a midwife! Get Mr. Kurz from the hotel. Let's get an ambulance and take them back where they belong. Says you. That kid is an American citizen. Operator, operator! Yeah, get a doctor, please. Hurry! What's the matter, Georges? Why are you so quiet? If you hate me so much, why don't you say it? Well... Go on, hit me, I'd much rather that. I will tell you what was the matter. Do you believe in premonitions? Where a black wave breaks over you and you suddenly know something terrible is going to happen... In my ears was the screeching of brakes of tyres taking a wild curve. Before my eyes was her foot on the gas pedal, pressing it down. But we don't know where Mr. Iscovescu is. Yes, I will give him the message. So soon as he comes. Yes, I have the name. Bad isn't it? On a straight, empty road. No-one knows how. Rolled over three times. What is it? - What is it? What happened to her? - Georges... - There was an accident, wasn't there? - Yes Bad? Where is she? They took her to the general hospital, Los Angeles. I'll take your car, Flores. They won't let you cross the border, you have no papers. - Give me the keys. - What are you going to do, crash that gate? They will catch you! If they catch you they will never let you in again, never. Don't. Georges, please, listen to me, all you wanted was to get into the country legally. Well you've got it and I won't let you throw it away. Listen to me, you idiot. They will catch you! You haven't got a chance. Georges! Why nowadays babies are born everywhere. Aeroplanes, rumble seats... Stop! Don't you see that sign? - What do you know? - There's a patrol ahead; a Mexican license. My old friend Iscovescu stepping right into my parlour. - Well, he won't get far. - You bet he won't. And I'll be there at the kill. That's my pigeon. What is the quickest way to Los Angeles? Keep on this road till you get to the next boulevard, stop. Turn right and that'll take you to Highway 101. Did you see a light gray coupe with a Mexican license go by here? - Yes, she just filled up a few minutes ago. - Thank you. It was 5 o'clock this morning when I got to the hospital. It wasn't till I climbed those steps that I was really afraid. Yes, afraid that it was too late and nothing left that I could do. - Mrs. Iscovescu, please. - Room 735 - Mr. Iscovescu? - Yes I'm John MacAdams. This is Mrs. Brown. - How is she? - Unconscious We are very much afraid, the steering wheel was crushed against her. - And there's no fight left in her. - It hurts her to breathe. - May I go in? - Of course. I am her husband. Emmy. Emmy. She doesn't hear. Emmy, it's Georges. Emmy, I've come. I'm here. Emmy, breathe. Try, darling. Try hard. Breathe That's it. Again, darling. Again. Breathe. That's alright. Remember? Remember the rain beating on the windshield that night? And the wiper going? And the word it spoke? Together. Together. Together. Together. Together. Together. Breathe, darling, we are together. Together. Breathe Breathe Breathe Breathe - How do you like that for parking? - Sassy, awful sassy. Say, that's a Mexican licence. Weren't they looking for some Mexican car? Sure. I do not know how long I sat there. But I must have said it a million times: "Together, together, together." Mr. MacAdams? You'd better by our friend here a cup of coffee. How is she? Coming along.
