THE TALE OF KING CRAB Giovanni, stop. The others are on their way. - Morning. - Go in, go in. Hello. How do you know he did it? - He set fire to it. - You saw him set fire to it? - It's hearsay. - Hearsay, my foot! They're stories passed down from ancestors. The doctor's son is kind of crazy. With fire, fury, and a roar, he evened the score. Luciano was the son of the town doctor. It was the late 1800s, early 1900s. People were dirt poor in Vejano in those days. Princes and poor people. Right, Bruno? Luciano hated the prince because he locked the passageway around the castle where Luciano used to cut through with his sheep, so he was furious. He committed the felony on the evening of the feast of Saint Orsio. - The day of the procession. - Yes. During the Saint Orsio procession, or so they say. - We weren't alive in the 1800s. - Right. Back then things were different since... there was no TV, at night they sat around the fireplace and told stories. This is the story of Luciano, it's a dark tale. Bruno? - What? - Listen to me sing. - Go ahead. - Go on. His mother certainly is not a dastard. But shame on her for making him a bastard. That's what they said about him, who knows if it's true. Chapter 1 "The Saint Orsio Misdeed". Many things were said about Luciano. Luciano was crazy. Luciano was an aristocrat. Luciano was a saint. Luciano was a drunk. He was known for having killed someone, but then he ran off. It's locked. The prince doesn't want us going this way. Obviously. I don't want trouble, let's go the long way toward the river. The water's shallow, the sheep can cross... They can slowly graze. Scoundrel of a prince! What are you doing? Don't, leave it alone. Stop it! The prince... will press charges, stop! - Are you afraid? - No, but he'll press charges. Stop it! Knock it off. Corrupt us with your treasures. Stop! What are you doing? Good thing he loves the commoners. Everyone loves you... This father would like to invite you to dinner. But I have nothing to give you. The bread is stale, the knife can't cut I'd like to set the table but have no tablecloth. The bread is stale, the knife can't cut I'd like to set the table but have no cloths. - If he won't let us go that way... - You bust down the door? If he wants it locked, he locks it. If he doesn't want that door opened, he won't open it. The shepherds have to go all the way around with their sheep. It's not how you think it is, you're wrong. - And you're right? - Yes! - Aren't you smart! - You're not! - I'm the boss of my stuff. - You don't get it. After 20 years, I have the right of way. Got it? Your stuff is still yours, but the passageway is mine, too. I remember walking through there as a kid, it was always open. Severino always went through with his sheep, and Giovanni... And now? He closed it? Because one day he decided to close it. - We have to go around. - Tell him, Eccelso. - It was always open and must stay open. - Says who? - It's the prince's property. - I walked through there as a kid. - Are you afraid, Severino? - I have a daughter to look after. If I go to prison, my daughter will be left all alone! The boss can do as he pleases. Understand? You don't decide, the boss does. You act up, cause trouble, then your father comes and makes amends. - What are you saying? - Your dad's a doctor. - So? - Your ass is safe, ours is not. Here's a coin. It's worthless to me, Severino. It's yours. I want to live as I please. It's worthless to me. Father? There's not much milk. I know. They don't eat enough. I remember when I was a kid you would always come to our house. I used to hide behind my father's legs. You were too big. Then one day we went down to the mill, to swim. Remember? Do you remember? I'll take you. Time goes by and I don't even notice. I've always been here. Have you ever thought about leaving? All the time. But where'll I go? We make do with what we have, right? Wrong. And why did you come back from Rome? I'm cured now or so they say... - So it's true what they say about you? - That I'm a drunk? Yes, I like to drink. No, that you're crazy. You don't want to kiss me? Why? Is that a cross? There are amazing things under the earth. It's Etruscan gold. So it's valuable? It's not about its value but what it represents. It's nice. I dreamt about it. What did you dream? That we sailed the seas and went far away. I felt immense pity for me, for you, and for everyone. But then the sea was just a lake like this one. - Help me! - Let me put this down. You just stand there holding things. Hurry up! Come on. Hold it. I'll take care of this. He was in a madhouse. He seems like a good guy on the outside but when he drinks he loses control. Give me a drink, Ercole. I don't feel well. No, I won't. Why not? Because your dad owes me money. - Money! - Bruno will bring you the money. I have 14 rifles, if he doesn't pay up I'll shoot him in the head! Come on, Ercole, give me something to drink. Don't make me beg. Fine, I'll get it. So you'll croak once and for all. Happy now? Is it sweet? Let me try it. Good, isn't it? Have you ever been in love, Ercole? Sure. With one person. My wife, that's all. I was 20, I was hunting in Abruzzo, I saw her and decided I'd marry her. And I did... Right away. I was madly in love. But... what can you do, she's gone now... and we're alone. Sing Tosca for me, Ercole. - Tosca? - Yes. Let's see if I remember it. The stars were shining and the earth was scented. And a footstep pattered on the sand. Oh soft kisses, oh sweet abandon. While trembling, I stripped the beautiful form of its veils. Vanished forever is that dream of love. Tosca has fled. And desperately I die, and desperately I die. And never before have I loved life so much. - A glass of white. - Red. - White. - Give me some red. I'll give you red. Just a splash for him. That's enough. The door must stay closed! I'm in charge... of everything. Got that? Got that? To our prince. To our rights. To the Republic. Huh? Who do you think you are? You're just pawns. I dare you. What have you done? You did it again? You let him get drunk again? You let him get drunk again. Scum! Slobs! Luciano! You of all people! Look what they did to you! Look! Those are dangerous people! They'll kill you. Understand? What am I going to do with you? You're always drunk. I can't stand you anymore. I don't understand you anymore. I asked you to stop going to the inn, but you keep at it. You should've told me you wanted to drink. You could've had a drink here. Ouch! You look dead. I can't take seeing you like this anymore. What'll I do? Tell me. Tell me what I should do. I feel empty. I'm in love, Bruno. In love? With whom? - Severino's daughter. - He'll kill you. Who would ever want you? I love you, Father. But promise you won't drink again. - Promise you won't drink. - Promise. I'm sorry, Bruno. I'm nothing but a drunk. There was a beauty. A red mouth. Come down from the mountain. Into the town. When night falls. The town sleeps. Love love. The heart sings. Even if far away. It always comes home. True love. Let me finish it off, give it to me. You were so handsome! But now you have this beard... You don't like me anymore? And the moon will see us. The moon won't tell on us. And the moon will see us. The moon won't tell on us. And the stars will see us. The stars cannot talk. And the stars will see us. The stars cannot talk. And the Lord will see us. And the Lord will forgive us. And the Lord will see us. And the Lord will forgive us. He died of thirst. And a lady cut off his whole arm to take his ring. Then she went on a pilgrimage for forgiveness for having killed the whole family in a fit of jealousy. But it seems odd that she cut off his whole arm just for a ring. It's just a legend. Anyway, I decided to wear the dress to the procession, and I'll go talk to the prince. He won't listen to you. Just because he's a prince you think he's better than me? I know who I am and what I'm worth. Tacco died here. Rest in peace. Know what the female mantis does to the male after they mate? She bites off his head. What's wrong? Listen here... Why aren't you wearing the necklace I gave you? Are you ashamed? I'm not ashamed of anything. You're so naive, such a child. It seems to me... that you don't care about anything. About me, about you, about anything. Here, take it back. I don't want your money. What's wrong, Severino? People see things and talk. It's a small town. Even the rocks know. About what? My daughter. I care for your daughter. You're nothing but trouble, you'll ruin her reputation. I have serious intentions. You're not on her mind anymore. In fact, she's with the prince. Are you drunk, Severino? Watch out! Saint. Orsio. Fury of his hand. Found blood. Saint of Redemption. She does look like Mother Mary... or the stars, which nobody looks at anymore, the moon... a connection with the universe. The Virgin still has that contact. - What about her crown? - A crown has no purpose. It only serves poor souls that don't understand anything sacred. The Virgin is the one who has a shining gold heart. You see, it's a glistening field. Imagine a field of sheep with gold plating. That's her dress. How lovely. We have to wait before saying it's lovely. Let's wait some more. And see what happens. Have you found treasures here in town? No, treasures don't exist. Treasures are having the chance to imagine a valley where something takes place. But first life must happen. We need an apparition of the Virgin. Most likely there's a treasure in that valley there. Who's that? Basically, he is... He's a ghost, that's who he is. What on earth are you wearing? You look like a meringue. It's the Saint's feast. How do you fit in with them? I don't. And you? The door must stay open. What door? Buddy! He's dead already. What a friend... He sold you out. He was afraid you'd run off with his daughter. He doesn't want a bastard as a relative. What did you say to the prince? What's become of you? You were such a handsome lad. Look at me! Fix yourself up. Sooner or later someone will kill you. The prince wants to see you right away. - Now? - Right away. What a nice necklace. Who gave that to you? It was a gift. I'm supposed to see the prince. Why, oh why about poor Emma. This morning we must sing. Why, oh why about poor Emma. This morning we must sing. I feel so terrible, so very terrible. I can't find peace, I don't want to feel. I feel so terrible, so very terrible I can't find peace, I don't want to feel. Three days after she had died. To the other world he had to flee. Before leaving he goes to the grave I want to see you, I want to die. There where she died, poor Emma. A flower bloomed without wilting. There where she died, poor Emma. A flower bloomed without wilting. - Why did he do it? Out of spite? - Yes, to spite the prince. - For not letting him go through. - He didn't know anyone was inside. He didn't know. Everyone was focused on the procession and he pulled that stunt. He set fire to the castle and someone inside died. His father the doctor pulled some strings to keep him out of jail, he made him leave Italy and go to the end of the earth. - So he emigrated. - Emigrated... I wouldn't call it that. He was spared from jail. Right, we could say he was extradited... He was extradited to avoid jail, his father sent him away. - To spare him from jail. - Prison. He was afraid he'd be killed. - Then he had a guilty conscience. - For sure. He caused a mess or else he would've come back. You don't run away unless you've done something. Then I never heard anything more, did you? No, he went to Argentina to seek his fortune, but then the stories end, there's nothing more about Luciano. People tell the story but... It starts off with ten words, but then 15 and 50 words get passed down... and in the end, the story isn't entirely true. Who knows what's true or not. Chapter 2 "The Asshole of the World". My name is Antonio María de la Vera, Salesian priest on mission in the Tierra del Fuego. I'm keeping this diary to bear witness to my discovery. There's a story going around amongst gold hunters and sailors. An island in the middle of the sea, at the end of the earth. One of the most savage and majestic places that exists in the world. Its cliffs are taller than towers, its rivers are poisoned, and its mountains are still unexplored. A treasure is hidden there. And I know how to find it. I am certain. I asked a herdsman to assemble a crew to take me to that island. In exchange, I promised him part of what we'd find. I don't know any of them, but most likely they're pirates and mercenaries. Greedy traitors by nature. How much money is a pirate's word worth? We are here. The priest must've landed on the other side of the cape. Let's go find him. The Janita, a ship of the Spanish monarchy transporting Incan gold from Antisuyu ran aground on these coasts after a storm. The captain hid the treasure on the island. It's an obsession for the sailors. That's why they call it "gold fever". Did you find water? No. Then what'll we drink? Brandy. Which way did he go? Bahía Aguirre doesn't have a church. Where are the other priests? Where are the women? There are only gold hunters, dirty and drunk. No! Don't drink that water, pirate! - Why not? - It's poisoned by the algae. That's how Janita's crew died. Listen to me, don't be stupid. Halt! We'll camp here. Captain, what are we doing here? The priest is half a day ahead of us. We'll never catch up at this rate. Captain, he's right. Yet again... An old man hounded by death. Lennox. Get up. Get up! Sorry, Captain. I didn't mean to offend you. Sorry, Captain. Accept my apology. You wanted to pocket all the gold? That's wrong, Father. God doesn't like that. Probably not, but gold is gold. Shall we kill him? We can't kill a priest. How were you planning to reach the treasure, Father? Won't you tell us? Is there a map? To find the treasure... you must follow the crab. What is he saying? A crab? That bucket over there... open it. A crab. What does this mean? The crab is our compass. And I am the map. What are we doing? Have faith. The crab will show us the way. There. Old sea dog... you died in a swamp. I was poisoned. Who would've thought? You left the ocean behind you, and where you are going there are no ports. - Amen. God save us. - Leave God out of it. At the time of death everyone is the same, guilty or innocent. We spend our lives trying to give meaning to what happens. But deep down we know... that we are nothing. We shouldn't have left the Captain there. He didn't deserve that. That Captain... isn't half the man the Captain of Janita was. Why did he hide the gold? Everyone knows. The ship wrecked and the sailors mutinied. He had to hide it. Now he was a real Captain! He wanted to keep it all, but it belonged to the Spanish monarchy. The Spanish monarchy's, the Captain's... Now it will be ours. I need to rest. Keep watch, Ventura. Now that the Captain's gone, who's in charge? Lennox. Tell me something, Father. A man who kills... where does he go? I will talk to God and answer you later. And the missing pages? I ate them. 50-50. They fled. What will you do with the gold? I'll buy some land and horses. Far from the mountains. I am a man of the plains. And you? Why do you want the gold? I want to go home. Can I have a drop? I haven't had a drink in 5 years. It's good. You're not Father Antonio. What happened? Did you kill him? You want to know what happened? I was heading toward Bahía Aguirre. There was talk of a man who found a nugget the size of a fist. Ever seen one that big? I couldn't stop thinking about it. Four days without food. I see a chapel on the other side of the hill. Today must be my lucky day, I think. The priest will give me some food. "Water", the priest said. Water... For the love of God... give me a blessed burial. I don't want to be eaten by vultures. Who are you? I'm Father Antonio. "If you bury me... the Janita gold will be yours". The priest said. It is written here. The gold... is hidden in the lake. To find it... you must follow the crab. I read the stories in the diary. To pass on their knowledge, the Tierra del Fuego savages told funny stories with a moral that were educational and entertaining. After listening to their stories, one legend stuck with me. A man comes across a crab on the mountains... "Why are you here and not in the sea?", the man asks. "I don't live in the sea", replies the crab. "But in a lake in the middle of the mountains". Then the crab says: "In that lake a treasure is hidden." Whoever wants to find it must know how to wait. "Follow me and I will show you the way." The two stories are one and the same. I am certain. The Janita treasure is hidden in the crab's lake. The Onas got revenge because Father Antonio stole the story from them. I saw an opportunity and I seized it. This is America after all. Father Antonio! Come on, crab. Move! Priest! Cover me! Son of a bitch! Damn it! Take me to the gold, priest! Quit shooting! We'll split it. Me and you. Okay. Lord... give me a hand. Let me die like a Pharaoh. Covered in gold from head to toe. Aren't you the one who performs miracles? Where should I go? I just need a sign. I just need a sign. Thanks, Lord. Maybe I went overboard with this priest story. I'm going to get angry. Where should I go? Where should I go? It wasn't my fault. I didn't know... she was in there. What will you give me? I will give you a hundred gold coins. And an embroidered bag. I don't want a hundred gold coins. Nor embroidered bag. I want a little kiss of love. If you want to give it to me. There is a lagoon, almost perfectly round, without any beaches, which the Onas call "Lagoon of the Crab". Surrounded by mountains, the lagoon is in the shade all day. According to legend, at sunset, its rays penetrate a narrow ravine that opens to the west. The water shines like a fiery shield and a golden light fills up the circular space, revealing the treasure. I dreamt that we sailed the seas and went far away. I felt immense pity for me, for you, and for everyone. But the sea was a lake just like this, the sun reflected on the water's surface and everything shone... because there was a hidden treasure, and whoever found it would become not a prince, but King.
