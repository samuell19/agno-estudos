(intense orchestral music) (clock ticking) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (electricity crackling) - [Shawn] Where are the others? - [Bailey] I don't know. I think it's just us. - [Shawn] Okay. On the count three, we book it to the base, all right? - [Bailey] What if we get shot? - [Shawn] Then it's game over for the both of us. But in my eyes we're still winners. We've proved ourselves. We're the ones standing after all. Okay. Ready? One, two, three, go! (suspenseful instrumental music) Okay, come on. Coast is clear. This way. Come on. (paint balls firing) (man grunting) Bailey! (paint balls firing) We're being ambushed! - [Bailey] Do you think? (paint balls firing) (man grunting) - [Shawn] Take out the guy on the left. - [Bailey] Shawn, the flag! - Oh, man! (paint balls firing) (Shawn grunting) I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit! Ah! I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit! - [Boy] Whoa! Whoa, hey, guys, wait, wait, wait! He's hit, he's hit. Hold your fire. He's good. (dramatic instrumental music) Guys, guys, there's someone over here! (paint balls firing) - Yeah! Woo! (kids chattering) Bailey! Leave cleaning guns to the losing team. Come on. - I know, right? It's the price you pay for getting shot in the last seconds? - No, I needed that. I wouldn't have won without it. You were my distraction. - Oh. - Bailey, I... I gotta say goodbye. - Now without helping me clean these guns first. - No, I... I mean, not today. I've got a couple days at home before I gotta regroup and go to university. - University? Dude, I'm like your best friend, and you haven't mentioned anything about university. That's a big deal, man. - Not necessarily looking forward to going. - Why are you going? Are you at least studying an area of interest? - I guess. I don't... My parents, they think that university is the ticket to making something of myself. I don't know. It's... I don't really know what I want anyways. When I was a kid, I used to want to be a missionary. I used to think it would be an exciting life. But to my parents, as you can imagine, it didn't bring in enough of an income. Nah, it's whatever. Okay, sorry. I don't know what I went with my life, and obviously they got an idea, so. - Well, I'm guessing that lifestyle wasn't exactly a... High-paying job for your parents. (phone beeps) (kids chattering) - Okay, that's my ride. Gotta go. - Don't forget to video chat, man. - I won't. - [Bailey] Hey, knock 'em dead. - Yeah. Thank you. - [Kid] Hey guys! You know we gotta get a picture of the last two men standing. All right, on three say "victory". One, two, three. - [Shawn And Bailey] Victory! (camera shutter clicks) (emotional string music) - Hey Shadrach? (knocks on door) - Dad? - You got everything ready? (electric shaver buzzing) (buzzing stops) The car's all loaded and ready to go in... when you are. - This is the last of it. Yeah. - Okay. All right. You've got a lot of tracks ahead of your, son, and you know we'd like to see you get there before... - I'll be fine! - Dark. We just wanna see, make sure you get there and you're all protected. - I'm gonna be fine. - Just... Shawn, there's just one thing I wanted to give you. I stopped by the store the other day, and I seen this very unique watch, and I thought of you. And I want to give it to you. (soft string music) - [Shawn] That's a cool watch. - Son, listen, you need to know it's gonna be a different life over there. It's totally different. You've been in my house and been protected. You're becoming the man over there, and I need for you to remain strong. Don't fall for everything everybody's doing. There's people that'll lead you down the wrong path. And don't forget, Pastor Harold Warren. I contacted him. - Yeah. - He's expecting you. The church is just about a block from the university. - [Shawn] Yeah. - One more thing, son. One more thing. Son, I want you to enjoy every moment of this university experience. I want you to do the very best you can do, 'cause, you know, in the future, you're gonna look back and be proud of yourself because you've done the very best you could do. - Yeah. (Shawn sniffles) (Shawn chuckles) Is the time right? - Well, it is if you want it to be. Shawn, you understand why we can't come to San Francisco with you. I mean, we're busy. I've got a meeting this afternoon, and it's just as easy to say our goodbyes here as it'll be- - I get it. - Shawn, I'm proud of you. - [Shawn] Yeah. (emotional string music) (students chattering) - Hey, you that new transfer student? - I am. I'm Shawn. - Riley. Where are you from? Minnesota. I took a semester at Walden. - Sweet. What ya majoring in? - Financial accounting and advertising. - Dude, is that "Dawn of Refuge"? It's like my favorite book! - Yeah. Here. - Sweet. Do you have all of his books? - I do. All Ted's books. - Sweet. Man, I could not believe when he gets out of that climax scene with the army surrounding him. Crazy. Good read, man. - Yeah. It's good stuff. - Anyways, I'll see you around. - Yeah. (students chattering) (emotional string music) (alarm ringing) (Shawn gasps) (Shawn sighs) (soft string music) (electric shave buzzing) (light instrumental music) - Okay, Shawn, buck up. Come on. You're in university. This is great. This is a good thing. People love university. Doesn't matter that your parents aren't here. Doesn't matter if they care about you or not. You're gonna make new friends. You're gonna learn a lot. You're gonna get a good job. Just be you. Okay. (Shawn sighs) Just try. Try to enjoy it.

Alright. - Shadrach Davis, God has given me a message for you. He wants you to know he has great confidence in you. The task that lies before you will be testing and you will experience wonderous and horrific things, but have no fear. God will be with you. He will surely guide- (vacuum whirring) Harold! What on earth are you doing? (Harold sighs) - Oh, okay. You're not an angel. - Honey, that there is my husband and I can assure you. He is no angel. (laughs) A pastor maybe, but an angel? (Harold mumbling) Yeah. So I'm not an angel obviously, but I really did hear from the Lord. I just didn't think coming from me, a pastor from who knows where, sends you a text out of the blue that you believe me. - Believe me at this point, I could believe just about anything. (serious string music) - God says, he's gonna take you on an adventure. - What? No, wait, wait, wait. Okay. An adventure, an adventure can mean anything. What does that, a mission? - I'm sorry. That's all God told me to tell you, so. - No, no, no, wait, wait. You can't leave me with that. You're a pastor. Tell me what, what did God tell you to tell me? - Last night God woke me up and stirred heavily in my spirit to tell you that he has something really great very soon for you and that he's gonna take you on an adventure. That's why I wanted you to meet me here. - And that's another thing. How did you get my number? - Ah. Your dad and I were good friends in college. Yeah. He called me the other day. Let me know that you were coming to the university down the street. You're pastor Willard? - Warren. Harold Warren. - Okay. You just loaded me up with like a multitude of unanswered questions. Are you sure that's all that you know, like God said to you? - Yeah. That's it, but I'll be praying for you, Shadrach. - Please call me Shawn. But I'll be needing those prayers apparently. Okay. I'll keep you updated. - Please do. I'll be expecting your arrival. - Yeah. (orchestral music plays) - [Announcer On TV] Here he is from Erie, Pennsylvania. Please welcome Brian. (audience on TV cheering) Now Brian, you have five options. Which card will you choose? - [Brian] Number four. - [Announcer] You know there's six of them, actually. That's six times 120, that's 720 points. Now for our first question. June 5th, 1989, the Chinese military forcibly suppressed the Tiananmen square protest. One man stepped in front of a tank to obstruct its path. (indistinct shouting) - [Announcer] What was the nickname given to the unknown protestor? - [Brian] Tank man! - [Announcer] Correct! You didn't even hesitate on that. (shouting in foreign language) - Hey, let go of me! (shouting continues) I don't, I don't know. - Do you deny crime? Yes, yes, yes. Okay, okay, yes. - Do you deny crime? Yes, yes, yes. Okay. I deny, I deny. Yes. - You deny? You deny crime? - Yes, okay. - [Announcer] Wrong answer. Let's try that again. What year did Benedict Arnold enter into secret negotiations with the British army before he fled in September, 1780? (Buzzer rings) Wrong. (wind howling) (furniture shaking) (crowd cheering) (bars clanging) (crowd cheering louder) - This has gotta be a dream. (electrical crackling) (weapons whirring) (Shawn panting) (crowd cheering grows louder) (lion growling) (lion grunting) (Shawn grunting) (lion roaring) (Shawn grunting) (crowd cheering) (lion growling) (blood splattering) (lion growling) (watch beeps) (ominous music) (Shawn panting) (sirens wailing) (Shawn exclaims) - Where's, where's... - Hey man. What's up? You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. - Dude, you need to get a grip on yourself. I don't know what you're on, but this is university. - Where are we? - At the library? Are you sure you're okay? What happened to your arm? - Oh, it's nothing. It's a cat scratch. - [Dex] Some wicked cat. You gotta get that looked after, dude. Okay, I have to go study. Just make sure you get that checked up. (ominous music) (Shawn grunting) - It wasn't a dream. (Harold reading prayer) (knocking on door) - So about that adventure. I don't get it. So at one moment I am in this Roman Coliseum. I'm screaming under a lion and then the next thing I'm screaming under a stupid lion statue. And these people are looking at me and they're gawking and I'm sorry. (Shawn panting) - Wow. That's, that's a lot to take in. - I keep thinking these experiences, adventures, as you call them, it's like just some sort of a bad dream, but look at my arm! Am I losing it? (Harold sighs) - Well, you got the marks to prove it. And God did say he was gonna take you on an adventure, so. - But this is crazy. This isn't adventure. This is, this is suicide. What's even the point? - Shawn, everyone talks about how the Lord works in mysterious ways. And here, I'm sure you could agree with me on that. But, but that is to say, God works in ways that often leave people totally bewildered. Why would God tell Joshua and the people of Israel to March around the city of Jericho for a week? What good could possibly come from Paul and Silas being beaten and arrested without a cause? You see the processes God uses are far beyond what the limited mind can understand. The Bible and the testimonies of Christians down through the ages are brimming with true stories of how God turned situation after situation completely upside down. And he often does that in the most unexpected ways. So I know this may seem crazy but maybe, just maybe God's preparing you for something. - Don't say he's preparing me for something big. 'Cause I couldn't handle anything bigger than this. - Just know that God declares the end from the beginning. And we could be sure that every event in the life of a believer serves God's ultimate plan. However, the Bible tells us God won't give us what we cannot handle. - I don't know whether to be flattered that God's got so much faith in me or afraid of what He's gonna be bringing me through. - But you could be sure it's all behind you, right? Remember this experience. - Yeah. (Students laughing) (Students chattering) - Hey Shawn, how's that arm treating you where that beast of a cat? Or should I even ask? - It's fine. Like it's not even there. - Oh, does that mean I can touch it? - No. French vanilla, please. - Shawn, you seem a little tense. I think you need to get out, you know, have a little bit of fun. I'm having a bit of a get-together tonight at my place. You wanna join with some of the guys? - Like what kind of get together? - Ugh. A few guys, a few girls, a few drinks, nothing too extreme though, exams are coming up. I wouldn't be that stupid. - So like, like a party? - No. Mm. Maybe like a small one. - I, I don't know, Dex. - Oh come on, it'll loosen you up on those exam. - I should be studying. Okay? - Hey, is it the girls you're worried about? - No, but it depends on the girl. - What does that mean? - Nothing. No, I, I didn't- - Is it the drinking? I mean, it won't be much, just- - Look, okay Dex. I just can't, okay? I got things to do. I gotta study. - Okay. Whatever. - Hey, I'm sorry about Dex. He can be immature. I'd like it if you came, I think you should. I mean, if you have studying it's no problem. I just... - Yeah, well it's, it's not like I can't go. I just, I don't know if I really- - It's fine, really. Don't worry about it. How's your eye? - Oh, it's good. It's like, okay. You might think it was you. It totally wasn't. It was like a gladiator shield, like hit me in the eye. So I'm just like. - Yeah. Okay. Do you tell that to everybody that you want to impress? Because I'm flattered. - (whistles) Come on Alicia, we're gonna be late. - I, I should actually go. - Okay. That's no problem. I'll see you later. - Oh snap. (Shawn muttering) (electricity crackling) - What in the? No. Where am I? (electricity crackling) (armor whooshing) (helmet clinking) (ominous string music) - (King Henry VIII) I want every trace of it burned! Destroyed! Dispatch of those that have any of these manuscripts- beginning with William Tindall. Charge him with the heresy he has spread throughout my land! - William Tyndale. - He has already smuggled the manuscripts into England and now Scotland! We must stop this imposter from permeating the entire world. Henry Phillips, therefore has given explicit instructions of his whereabouts. And I want his death to be made a public mockery. Now go. (Shawn grunting) - Come now, Sutton. We've been given the order of capturing Tyndale. (ominous string music) (armor clanking) (Shawn grunting) (helmet rolling on floor) (Shawn panting and grunting) (paper rustling) - The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not be in want. Tyndale... I know why I'm here. I know why I'm here. I can fix history. - Just be vacant hither, let us set off abound. - I, I can't let you kill this man. You may not know it yet, but what he's doing is actually really good. - Sutton, have you gone mad? Clear from my path and return to your position. - But you're killing an innocent man. - You've taken a knight's oath, lest you've forgotten. So be it, Sutton. Therefore no man come between me and my orders. (armor sparking) (blades clanging) (Shawn grunting) (both grunting) (swords clanging) (Shawn bellowing) - [Knight] Enough! (horse carriage rolling) (townspeople screaming) (horse carriage coachmen muttering) (Shawn grunting) - Sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. (paper rustling) - Are you William Tyndale? (William panting) - Get back. I've been sent here to save your life. - Who art thou? For thine appearance is not of my ally. - The king wants you dead, along with all your followers. Your books, burned. Please. I think God has sent me here to save your life. We gotta get outta here. We have time. I'm not one of them. This is a disguise. - I shall comply, but I must not leave without all my work. It is imperative that I return for it. - Wait, no, you can't go back. You gonna be captured. They're watching that place like a hawk. They already know it's your study. You need, we need to go now. - I've glimpsed the bitter face of death in sacrifice to those manuscripts. Many of which are ready for print. I simply cannot abandon my labor for it is the precious word of God. - Okay. Alright. Hurry. (William gasps) (ominous string music) - Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no. (watch beeps) (townspeople chattering) - Gotta catch that carriage. (townspeople chattering) (Shawn fumbling) (Shawn grunting) (horse carriage trekking) (dynamic string music) (Shawn grunting) (armor clanging on ground) (Shawn panting) (intense orchestral music) (horse carriage trekking) (Shawn panting) - Halt, you there! By order of the King. (townspeople shouting) (somber string music) (knights muttering) - We must make this fire! - [Knight] Come on! (Shawn gasping) (flame sparking) (water splashing) (townspeople screaming) (fire crackling) - Lord, I ask that the king of England's eyes be opened unto you! (screaming in pain) - Move! (townspeople screaming) (William bellowing in pain) (fire crackling) - Get out of the way! Go! (man grunts) (William sobbing) (fire crackling) (somber orchestral music) - Stop that man. He's a traitor to the crown. (swords sheathing) (watch buzzing) (Shawn yelping) - Did you see that? - That kid's gonna die. (Shawn chuckles) - I come in peace? (man chuckling) (window crashing) (both grunting) - Shouldn't mess with him, kid. Mm-hm. - What the heck do you think he's doing? - Ain't he cute? (gun flipping) (gun cocks) (gun flipping) (gun cocks) (Shawn chuckles) - I can put this right back where I found it. Yeah... (shots firing) - What's the meaning of this? - Now, Reverend, we're just trying to show this fella how to have a good time! And by the looks of it he hasn't danced in a coon's age. - This young fella was just in the saloon, trying to rough up Jeb. - And if you don't step out of the way, we're gonna have to teach you some too. Or are you afeard? - If you think that I'm a man to be afraid, then Jeb, you don't know me yet. Are you so weak that you need to stoop to his level now? - Yeah. Pastor, you just think you'd come in here and make everything better, don't you? You'll see, we don't need your kind around here. Bible-thumper. - So I thought. How you doing son? You hurt? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. - What's your name, son? - My name? - Yeah. What's your name? - Shawn? - You seem a little unsure of yourself. 'Round here, you need to know who you are and be strong for what you stand for. Pleased to meet your acquaintance though. My name's Billy Sunday, Reverend Billy Sunday. You're not from around here. Are you? Well, have you got any place to stay? - No. - Well, I'd be pleased if you'd stay with me. Come on. Come on in, son. This is where you'll be sleeping. Make yourself at home. - Thank you. - You know, son, when you enter into a house, people take kindly when you take off your hat. - Oh. (guns firing) (man shouting) How could you stand to live in a town like this? This is worse than the cities I'm used to. Not Minnesota at least. - Oh, that's probably Jeb and his gang. Yeah, it's a rough town, alright. Lord knows, it's a modern day Coliseum. (Shawn chuckles) The gold rush made it rough. It just, stayed rough. - Isn't there laws against shooting in the streets though? - (chuckles) There's not been a sheriff in these parts for years. Therefore there are no laws. There was a church once, but it went up in smoke about the time the sheriff did. - Whoa. So why do you stay here? - You know, there are sometimes that I ask myself that very question. Then I'm reminded of the words of Jesus that says, "it's not the healthy that need a doctor, but it's the sick that need amending." And I do believe that God has called me to take a stand and tell these folks about Jesus. - That takes a lot of guts. I don't know if I could do that. - Neither can I. Not on my own anyway. Well, I've gotta get some sleep. I've gotta make my rounds in the morning and gotta go see Ms. May May. - Were you in baseball? - Loved baseball. - Huh. - But I love Jesus more. - Red socks. (gunshots firing) (metal clanging) (clock tower bell tolling) - Well boy, you're burning daylight. - What time is it? - Well, it's almost seven o'clock. I've already done all my rounds. You want some coffee? - At this hour? Probably be a good idea. What time did you get up this morning? Well, I got up with the chickens. (Shawn grumbling) (water boiling) - I'm just gonna go look around a little bit if that's all right with you. - Here, you might need this. Now I might not be here when you get back. 'Cause I have an appointment with the devil. - Oh howdy. - 'Sup? - Who was that? - His name is Shawn. - Odd name. I've never seen him before. Where's he from? - I do not know. (upbeat western music) (horse neighing) - [Storekeeper] Andy, you ought to try this out. We just got it in. I haven't had a chance to try it out myself yet but they say it's a real sharp shooter. I haven't had a chance to sight it in yet. - Yeah, she's a beaut. What you got in handguns? - Handguns. Got one around here somewhere, I know. (cork tightening) (glass shatters) - Good grieve, Andy. You've gotten plumb loco? (glass clinks) (townspeople chattering) - What's going on over there? - [Townsman] Ah, it's probably that old preacher trying to get things stirred up over there again. - Preacher? What's he doing in the saloon? - [Townsman] Well, you know, he gets apreachin' if people get a might stir up under the account of their convictions. - [Billy Sunday] You don't know what tomorrow brings. You don't have the promise it's even gonna happen, but give your life to Jesus today. Today is the time to shine for Jesus. Today is the day to have your name written in the lands book of life. Man, if you accept Jesus as your Lord and savior, then you don't have to be condemned to hell! - Preacher, I don't need to be saved from anybody. - It's not a somebody that we need to be saved from. It is ourselves and our own sinful nature in the route that God has against sin. God sent his son, his only son, Jesus Christ, into this world to save us from Hell and to spend eternity with him in Heaven. That's the gift of God. - This ain't your church. We burned your church down for a reason. - And thank you for burning down that church, for the church lives in me so that I can bring the church to you and let me tell you one thing, sir, that church is still on fire. Men, don't be deceived by the lures of this world for they only promise the death of Hell. - Hey, take it easy, Mr. Sunday, you can get yourself shot. - Hebrews tells us we will never go before our appointed time. It took a blood sacrifice to cover sin, (Shawn muttering) but it took the blood of God. Jesus Christ, God's own son to come to this earth to take away the sins of the world, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe within him should not perish but have everlasting life. Is there anyone here who would be ready to give your life over to the giver of life? He accepted a sinner like me. He'll accept a sinner like you. Are you willing to lay aside your pride in front of all of these witnesses to give your life over to the giver of life? I see that hand. I see that hand. (chair falling) - Are you gonna follow this lily-liver? Bible-thumpers? (Jeb shouts) - Come one, come all who raised your hand for salvation. I wanna pray with you. Come on. Jesus will accept you. Come on. That's it. I wanna pray with you. (Billy sighs) My beautiful day. (horse neighing) I've got an errand to go and see a good friend of mine who's been ailing some. Would you care to go with me? - Uh. (watch beeps) Yeah, I got time. - [Billy] Good. Come on. All right, you on? - Yeah. (exciting western music) - So how far away is this place, exactly? - Oh, just a little jog over here to the west. Let me tell you something about Annie. This is well worth the trip. She's a powerful woman of God. I said "Well Annie, tell you what? When I grow up I wanna have faith, just like you." Hello, Annie. Billy Sunday here. - Well, Billy. Brother, Billy. - How you feeling today? - Oh, this whole body's done me good, I don't mind saying. But it's showing its age and it's plumb worn out. (Billy chuckles) - I brought a friend to see you. This here is Shawn Davis. - Oh, Davis. Davis, I don't reckon I recall any Davis. Are you from 'round these parts boy? - No, uh, I mean I'm, I'm from Minne-, uh, Canada. - Oh, you're a long ways from home. You know? I reckon I'm closer than I've ever been before to my real home. - Yes. - I've just been passing through this whole world till now. - I look forward to seeing Jesus. - Mm. (Annie coughing) - I'm mighty thirsty. Would you mind getting me a cup of water? - (indistinct) some water, boy. (Annie coughing) - Where do I get the water? - From the well boy. Outside! - Right? Yeah. - No. Not that bucket. Use this one over here on the table. - He's a rather odd boy, ain't he? (light western music) - I've seen this in Westerns. How hard can it be? (handle cranking) (Shawn grunting) (metal clanging) (water splashing) (Shawn laughing) - Yeah. There we go. - And Father, I thank you for Annie's life. For she has been an example of the believers and Lord, I pray that you would cause her to live the remaining days of her life with purpose. And now Lord, would you shine your divine favor upon her so that that will suffer her no pain. We ask all of this in the precious and holy name of Jesus Christ. Amen. - [Annie] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Billy. Your visits always bless and encourage me so much. God, go with you. - He will. And be with you. Miss Annie. Now I'm gonna come back and check on you in a week or so. - Right here, boy. - It was nice meeting you, Miss Annie. And you. Go with God. - All right, Shawn. If you're ready, we need to be getting along. It's gonna be dark soon. - That Miss Annie, she's so old and yet, so spunky. - Annie's lived a long life. Served the Lord since she was young. Her strength comes from Jesus. - Look I've gotta go somewhere anyways. I can't go with you and I don't think I'll ever see you again. I just, I wanted you to know how much you've put things into perspective for me, show me where my place was and just what I needed to do. Thank you. - Just remember one thing, Shawn, if you don't take a stand for something, stand for something. You're liable to fall for anything. (horse neighing) (horse trekking) (sentimental string music) - Goodbye, Mr. Sunday. (watch beeps) - Dude, your grade. You're lucky you even made it on the board. Oh dude. Shadrach Davis, man. He's been doing so good, weird name though. Know anybody with that name? (loud whooshing) (Shawn yelps) - I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. (watch hitting floor) (electricity zapping) (glass shattering) (Shawn panting) I don't have a time on me but business class is next, right? Cool. (students chattering) - [Instructor] Listen up. I'm handing out your papers. (papers rustling) - Hey Shawn. I am the lead in this play. - No way! - It opens in one month and it's kind of a big deal for me because I want to be an actress. You should come. I think it'd be really cool if it was packed for my debut. - Yeah, no, totally. I think that's awesome. I'm happy for you. I'll be there. It's awesome. - All right. - [Instructor] Sam. - 'Sup. - Owen. (students discussing) - [Instructor] And Dexter. - [Owen] Dexter, what'd you get? Let me see. Let me see. (Sam and Owen laughing) - Alicia. Shadrach. Morgan. - [Morgan] Thank you. - [Instructor] Economics is the study of how the production (watch zapping) (instructor teaching) - [Instructor] ...and statistics. There are two branches of economics: macroeconomics and microeconomics. Oh wow. You'll find your assignments on gateway. Class dismissed. (students chattering) (ominous music) - So Shadrach, you don't talk about your family a whole lot. But with a name like Shadrach I could only imagine. Are you a Jew? - Dex, What are you talking about? - [Dex] Oh no? Or are you denying it? I mean, they always do, but I'll bet you're religious. The kind where your daddy has to stand on a pulpit to embarrass himself. Am I right? How could someone like you ever fit in here with a background like that? I mean, we are our own, but you're trapped in a little box trying to get into our world. Hmm. Well, let me straighten things out for you. Religion is the worst form of terrorism and because of that, I'm gonna be watching out for you and you better be watching your back for me. Ooh. One more thing. Stay away from Alicia. Okay, I'll see you in class tomorrow. (door shuts) (clock ticking) (bell tolling) (electricity zapping) (Shawn grunting) (car engines sputtering) - No, no, no, no, no. (mysterious jazz music) - You're not trying something funny, are you Harv? This is only half the money. - Hey. I kept on my half of the deal. Half for you, half for me. - That's not how it works. The deadline was three weeks ago. The other half is interest. - Hey, I thought you was a sensible guy. Be reasonable. Why don't you? - Oh, I can be reasonable. Bino, pay the man what he's worth. Give him what he's got coming to him. (gun cocks) - (Harv) Hey, Hey now. Oh, we can talk. Let's- (gunshots firing) - [Man] Big boy wants to see ya. - [Strange Man] I hope my boys didn't rough you up too much out there. Word out you witnessed our little charade there back in the alley. - Look, I'm really sorry. I really didn't see anything and that which I did see, which was nothing I won't tell anybody about because there's nothing to tell, right? (wood creaking) - [Strange Man] No, you won't. And in fact, That's why you're here. You see the paper comes out in three days. And the people are gonna want to know what happened. And in fact, they have a right to know and to think that their little town is safe and that poor Mr. Harvey, the local barber was hit and run over by a reckless drunk driving a Pontiac sedan, God rest his soul, at precisely 11:27 PM, tonight. You see, I personally saw the skid marks stretching out across the road, leaving behind a wife and two children. Tragic. - Oh, I get it. This is like a offer I can't refuse kind of deal. - No, this is an offer you shouldn't refuse. Get my boy a cigar. - No thank you, I don't smoke. - And just so you know, I'm gonna be reading that column of yours, like I always do. - Column? Oh, well isn't the job of a reporter to report the truth? - I have no problem with an honest reporter on the beat. Ones you can't buy, you just gotta relocate them somewhere where they won't cause you any trouble. (snaps) I think he needs a bit of convincing. - What? No. Hey wait. Hey, no. Hey stop. Stop, no. Let go of me. (door closing) No! (head bangs) - Better take your shirt off too, Bino. Don't want to get any blood on this one. (chuckles) (Shawn falling) - [Bino] Hey, Hey! (quick jazz music) (Shawn panting) - [Henchman] You check in here. I'll keep going. (clinking) (gunshots firing) (liquid splashing) (gunshots firing) (gunshots firing) (bottles exploding) (flames crackling) (ominous music) (Bino grunting) (gunshots firing) (Shawn yelping) (gunshots firing) - [Henchman] Over here! - Come on. There's gotta be a passageway around here somewhere. There's a passage way everywhere. (wall sliding) (quick jazz music) - No, no. Damn it. God, why? Why is it gotta happen? Why you bring me through all this? (watch beeps) (electricity zaps) (intense music) - Stop! I'm telling you! I never knew this Jesus. (sentimental string music) (baby cooing) (divine orchestral music) - [Divine Being] Shawn, don't be afraid, Shawn. I am the great I am. The alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. The word made flesh. The son of God. And I will never leave you nor forsake you. And lo I have been with you and will be with you always. Yes, I have been with you all throughout your journey. I have a plan and a purpose for your life and I am to be trusted for I cannot fail. - Jesus. - You asked me why I brought you through these trials, but through testing molds character, my character in you. You have been marked for greatness and have been called for such a time as this. Will you trust me? Arise, Shawn. For I want to in you a mighty warrior. (energy whirring) (electricity zapping) (Shawn grunting) (lightning striking) (Shawn whimpering) (Shawn grunting) (bones rattling) (Shawn grunting) (loud ominous whirring) - Hear the word of the Lord. (thunder clapping) (intense ominous music) (Shawn grunting) (bones rattling) (wind howling) - Are you my prophesy? Let the dry bones come together bone to bone and let the sinews and the flesh be formed and cover the from above. By the power of the almighty! (bones rattling) (Shawn grunting) (ominous music looming) My subtle bones, I will make you a mighty army. Save the Lord utmost. (liquid gushing) (Shawn panting) (music intensifies) I prophesy to the wind, breathe the breath of Jehovah God, into your lungs and come alive! (wind howling) This is what the sovereign Lord says. Oh my people, I will open your graves of exile and cause you to rise again. Then I will bring you back to the land of Israel. When this happens, oh my people, you will know that I am the Lord. I will put my Spirit in you and you will live again and return to your home, your own land. Then you will know that I am the Lord who has spoken and I have done what I said. Yes. The Lord has spoken. (orchestral music) (army shouting) (watch beeping) (electricity zapping) (Shawn yelps) - [Girl] Hey, you alright? (Shawn grunting) - Whoa. You look like you've been through a war. - It's been a long day. Lemonade please. - [Girl] Yeah. College can do that to a person, I know. So you must be in drama. I must say, the makeup artist has really improved since last year. (cashier rings) You do know that the play started 20 minutes ago, right? You're in the play? The play? - The play, yes! I'm just waiting for my cue. - Just making sure. - Thanks. - Break a leg. - Don't say that. (audience laughing) - [Actor] Check out this new tape recording device I found in the attic. It was mine when I was a kid your age. - [Actor 2] Dad, that's so old school. As is cleaning out the attic, that's pretty retro too. - [Actor] No, this thing was the smartphone of its day. - [Actor 2] Now it looks like something ancient Egypt. I even have a recording app on my phone. - Well, this inspired it. Here, just for kicks, why don't we give it a try? Let's just have a normal father-son conversation. Hello son. I see you are doing your schoolwork. - Uh, yeah, Dad, just doing my trig homework. (audience chuckling) You know dad, this is kinda- - [Actress] Honey, the electrician is here! - Oh, gotta go. - [Alicia] He's here. - Who? The electrician? - No, Adrian. In fact he invited me to his apartment tonight. - Like overnight. - [Alicia] Yep. - Well you didn't turn him down too hard. Like you didn't hurt his feelings, right? - No. I told him yes. (audience chuckling) - Would you excuse me for one moment? (hammer clanging) (audience laughing) - Oh, well, nothing's that bad deary. - Even if I'm sleeping with him? You're religious, right? - Well, I'm not a demon. - Well, Adrian is very religious. Every Christmas it's off to church with him. - You know, honey, going to church won't save you, but it will get you in good standing with a big man up top, if you know what I'm saying. - Thank you, Mrs. Maple Tree. - Anytime, deary. You know what they say? - I think I do. Jesus, Right? - Did someone call me? (audience laughing) (ominous music) - Come here, baby. I'll take you in. You can spend the night with me any time you want. After all, I am the God of love as they say. - Amen. Hallelujah. - Some of you have asked when you're all alone with your thoughts, "How do I get into this grand palace called heaven?" Well, it's easy. You just gotta love me. - What's not to love? - Love my creation. Love one another, right, babe? - Where is he going with this? - I don't know where he's at. He's speaking off script! - You bring the water and I'll bring the wine and we'll have a grand old party. - Line, Dex! Line! - When you make a fool of yourself and defend me, you're just playing yourself. That's right, get up. Walk away. Nobody cares. It doesn't even matter! (bell tolling) (heartbeat thumping) - God, why? - Destroy! - This ain't your church. - Stand for something. - No! - No! My God will not be treated like that. My God will not be mocked. I will not stand by while you choose to mock the one who gave you, who gave me life and breath. I've seen hate. I've witnessed what hate does when innocent people die. I have seen the fear of those when other people cheering for your death because of hate. Breath of angry lions bearing down at you in the Coliseum of this world. But I've seen men, real men stand up for Jesus when they knew death was in store. I've seen victory in the midst of chaos when the world laughed and scoffed, called it failure. I've seen a mighty army rise up against the odds when the Lord God was on their side. But when you stand here and choose to mock shamelessly with the breath of angry lions bearing down on you in Coliseum of this world, it's time to take a stand. It's time to stand up for what is righteous. (Dex scoffing) - [Woman In Green] Hey kid! That Jesus that you're talking about. I mean, I heard about him as a kid, but how do you know that he's real? - [Woman In Red] I was a drug addict, broken and lost. I was sentenced to a Christian rehab facility and found God. Jesus healed me. He delivered me from that bondage. I am a living testimony that what you're saying is true. - [Man In Plaid] I was broken and abandoned. My family was falling apart and I was unwanted as a child. When someone told me about this God, he had shown me a piece like I'd never known. - [Man In Suit] My family was also falling apart. My marriage was failing and I was desperate for a change. And I found Jesus. (sentimental string music) - Dex, wait. I don't know what you believe, but I know what I believe. I am a Christian and it's not because I just believe it but I've seen it to be true. What do you believe, Dex? When I first came to university, I felt suffocated by an ungodly world. I wanted to be a Christian, but I just, I didn't feel like I could. But through these experiences I saw how there's always been a form of persecution, no matter when you've lived. And I can be a light, it is possible. And whether it's your work environment or school or whether the world is just a mess, the more difficult the environment you are in the greater your call as a Christian is. The question is, will we listen? I could have easily walked out of that theater, but I just couldn't, not after what I'd been through. I saw men die for Christ under the worst of circumstances. - Yes. - And I thought "They stood the test of time then. Why can't I today? Why not today?" - Whoa. Shawn, this is big. This is, this is really huge. Shawn, I remember you once said you wanted to be a missionary. - Yeah. - But I think through this experience, you see where your mission truly lies. Shawn, would you mind sharing this testimony on church on Sunday? I think there's a lot of people who really need to hear it. Don't worry if they believe you or not. It's not your job to make them believe. God is giving you these experiences to share and shop in others. - Yeah, I would love to share. - Really? Awesome. - Go ahead. - Alright. Uh, hey, we were just getting ready to pray over this. Do you have any prayer requests? (warm music) - [Waitress] Actually I do.
