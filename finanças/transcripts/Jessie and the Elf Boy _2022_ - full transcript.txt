Well I never set out to create a brand but that's what happens when you provide a service that really resonates with people. And it's been very humbling seeing the way that this has taken off. For me, it all started with the desire to help people express themselves because our style choices are indeed a form of expression. So we shouldn't be looking out there to see what we can pin on ourselves, we should be looking inside to see what we can bring out. And that's our philosophy here at Valerie's Salons. We help you to look inside. Because we believe that... inside everyone is beautiful. Inside everyone is beautiful. Hi. So this is me. And if I'm going to tell this story properly I probably need to start a bit further back. Eh... a bit further back. Ah. Perfect. You see, according to legend, inside one particular forest there lived, well... an elf. He didn't look like you might expect. No wings. No pointy ears. But he had special abilities... to nurture... to create... and to... eh... dance. He may have been small but it was his job to take care of the whole forest. His name was Ghillie Dhu and this is the story of how he changed my life. Help! Is... is somebody there? Hello? Nobody. There's nobody there. Hello. Who's there? Hello, I'm Ghillie Dhu. Where are you? - Here. - Where? - Here. - I can't see you. Are you a branch? Ghillie Dhu, can you help me? I don't know how to get home. Where do you live? Birchwood Cottage. It's at the edge of the forest. It's yellow with white windows. This way! Thank you. Em... Can I stay with you a bit longer? Don't you want to go home? I will but... why can't I see you? I'm not like you. You sound just like a boy. I want to see you. You're not meant to. Wait! Please! Don't go! How can I see all this but not you? Long ago we were shielded from your eyes... but it's possible to lift the veil... with this stone. I want to see. Wow. I'm sorry, I can help with that. You've got a lot of these haven't you? That's Grey. She's a pony. She likes apples. - I've always wanted a pony. - You can meet her if you like? I think she likes me. It's so cute. How do you do it? - I listen. - Huh? Am I allowed to see what it is now? - Not yet. Isn't finished. - Uh, I really want to know. When will it be ready? Tomorrow? - Maybe. - Okay I think I can wait till then. I want to stay here! Mum, please! That's enough! This stops now do you hear? Grow up! Huh? Go where? Grey? What do you mean? Stick 'em up! Stop wasting time and get on with it. - You just going to watch? - I have tennis elbow, remember? 'Course you do. Uh, I need a wee. - Why didn't y'go before we left? - I did. - I need one again. - You and your bladder. You and your elbow. - What was that? - Relax, I told you. They're long gone. Maybe it was bird or something? Yeah. Whatever. Come on. We've got enough. Let's wrap this up. - I don't like this place. - What you on about? - We just started. - I'm serious. It feels like... someone else is here. Get a grip. There's nobody else here. You are away with the fairies. What was that? Stop swiping that thing about you almost hit me! Uh, what was that! What's wrong with you? Have you gone mad? There's definitely something there. I'm telling you, Lara, there was something there. - There was not. - I heard it! - You did not! - I did so! Kev, just drop it. It was your imagination, okay? What was that? What happened? In the house! In the house! In the house! Where am I? We help you to look inside. Because we believe that... inside everyone is beautiful. Inside everyone is beautiful. Yeah, your hair is quite high porosity I'd say. Have you tried any high protein products or any natural oils, like coconut or almond or argan? Oh, sorry, it's bit of a tangle back here. Come on. Outcha come! Ugh! Stupid brush again! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Why am I so nervous? Sal, please tell me that I'm not gonna totally mess this up? Mess up what? The hair, your job, your future? So many options. - Very funny. - Oh, relax, you'll be fine. - You think so? - Sure. I know about these things. You know, it would really help to practise on some real hair. Nobody touches the hair. Especially you. Oh, thanks for the vote of confidence. Jessie, you'll be fine. How bad can it be? - Your boss is your mum. - Yeah and my mum has barely spoken to me since my school days. Plus she's not my boss. She's my boss's boss. You're still the only child of the Valerie of Valerie's Hair Salons. That's gotta count for something. Excuse me. I'm Jessie Macrae. - I'm the... - The new trainee. You should've been here 15 minutes ago. - Oh, I was told... - You were told to be on time. That means 15 minutes before the time that you were told. - I'm sorry, I didn't... - Put your stuff in the back and sort your face. - Quickly! - Where's the back? Never mind. Wow. Not a good start for you, is it? Stand here and don't move. Alright people! I shouldn't have to remind anyone here that we are entering our most important season yet. Madame Belle has agreed to join our clientele, as and when she visits Scotland, and we also welcome Mrs. Roland and Susan Mandalay. And don't listen to the hearsay, she is still very much in the modelling business. Why do these people come here? Because they know that we are the best. They know that what we offer here, is unique and unrivalled. And that is why nothing... must lower the quality of the service we provide. Excellence is what we strive for. Always. Let's get to it. So... you think you've got what it takes to make it in this place? We'll see. What's that? Who's there? Hello. I'm Ghillie Dhu. Oh aye. That's good. How's it going? Not very well. I'm beginning to think I may never find her. - Find who? - The girl. Oh, you're looking for a girl are you? - Aren't we all. - Are we? Oh aye, that's our curse. Don't worry. She's out there. You keep looking. You'll find her. You really think so? Anything for foster families? Thank you very much. - I'm sorry. - Pardon me. It's you! Tyler. Tyler Vim. I was at your show. Hey, nice one. Hope you had a good night. I would love a selfie with you. - Yeah, sure. I can spare a... - But my boss hates it when I'm late, so I've got to go. I'm sorry! Random. Good afternoon, Mrs. March. May I take your coat. Tea? Just the usual please. Orange and lotus flower. Penelope! How lovely to see you. It's been a while. Can I get you a cup of tea? Camilla! Welcome. Is the pressure okay for you Miss Pom Pom? How's that pressure for you Miss Pom Pom? Is the pressure okay for you Miss Pom Pom? Lovely, we'll see you soon, Vanessa. Have a wonderful weekend. Or not. Toff. So glad this day is over. - Are those for the bank? - What? I could take them for you if you like? No. You need to finish the floor. And do it properly this time. I'll be back to lock up. - When? - Long before you're done by the looks of things. Chop chop. Or you could maybe help? Alright people! I shouldn't need to remind anyone here that I am the greatest person in the whole world and this place is paradise. And that is why nothing... - Ah, what are you doing? - I've found you. I've finally found you! You're... old. Eh, I'm sorry, who are you supposed to be? Don't you remember? It's me! Ghillie Dhu! Sorry, please... wait here. So, em, what is it you're after today? The usual please. I have an interview this evening. I would have called in advance but today has been an absolute wash out, you know how it is. I'm so glad I came here before you closed. - Such a relief. - Yeah, such a relief. Back in a sec. - Hello? - Amelia, thank goodness. - It's Jessie. - What do you want? You need to come back right now. - Excuse me? - We have a client. A client! I'm on my way. Don't say or do anything, okay? Jessie? No no no! Have you completely lost your mind? What have you done? I like it. It feels bold and exciting. Yes, it's good. And how nice to be surprised for a change. Amelia, thank you. You've got a fine young talent here. The next Valerie perhaps. What were you thinking? You are a trainee. Do you realise how your little stunt could have ended? I know what's going on here. You think that just because you're Valerie's daughter you don't have to put in the hard work like the rest of us. Well I've got news for you, Madam. I am the manager of this salon and I do not tolerate nepotism. It's a word, look it up. I know what it means. And believe me my mum hasn't helped me at all. Oh no, of course not. Well you won't be getting any special treatment from me that's for sure. Step out of line again and you are finished. Is that clear? Yes. I won't do it again. Oh yes you will. - I promise I won't. - No I'm telling you, you will. - I want to see you do it again. - But I thought you just... Vera liked the style. And since you're so keen to show off your talent, here's your chance to prove it wasn't a fluke. I want to see you do the style again tomorrow, on one of the staff before opening. - But, I don't... - And as you're so keen for extra responsibility, here. You can give this whole place a thorough clean this evening and lock up once you're done. And it had better be spotless. See you at eight. Where did you learn to style like that? You're so young. Did you train? How did you do that? I listen. Who are you? You don't remember? No. I'm sorry. Is it because you grew old? I'm not that old okay. Then why did you forget? I don't know. No, wait. Please don't go. I have to recreate what you did tomorrow and I have no idea how. I really need to learn that style. Can you help me? Okay, so I got a good look at the style when it was finished, so I know where we're headed. But, I don't know how you got there. So first can you show me how you prepared the hair? Are you okay? It's just a training mannequin, look. Off to a great start. What are we gonna practise on now? - Hey. - Oh... eh... Yeah. - Hey. - Are you alright? Sal, I... eh... this is Ghillie Dhu. Ghillie, this is my flatmate, Sal. - What's going on? - Are you not weirded out? A little bit yeah. - I met him at the salon. - Did you? He's helping me learn a style. Uh huh. Are you sure you're okay? Ah! What was that? Be careful! What is wrong with you? What's wrong with me? You're the one acting weird. That doesn't mean you have to assault him. - Assault who? - Ghillie, you can come out now. - She's not going to hurt you. - Stop it! - Who are you talking to? - It's the stone. The stone? It's... It's... - It's... - It's freaking me out that's what it is. Tell me what's going on! Put this on. And what's this supposed to... Holy c... So? What do you say? I told you, Jessie. No one touches the hair. But, Sal, this is my chance. It's not every day that you meet a... you know... Your hair is like a rose bush. Okay. Let's do this. Jessie? Ghillie? I want a refund. - Olly. - Yep. Put out an ad for a new trainee. Eh... okay. And find a chair for our new junior stylist. - Really? - Get her set up. I'll email you her client list later. Righto. This way Jessie. And that is pretty much it. You've been here a while, you know how things run. So, eh... what have you done to offend Amelia? I think it's my family connections she has an issue with. Must be hard. But also pretty sweet, right? What is she like as a mum? Eh... you know... Uh oh. Amelia's sent through your clients. She is not making your life easy. Why, who are they? Alright, brace yourself. Here goes. This is Victoria Rainey. She's usually looking for a shampoo, a style and a scandal. She never stops talking and is always one step away from a panic attack. Whatever you do don't mention Brussels. - What happens if you mention... - Just don't. Evangeline Cameron on the other hand never says a word so we have to assume she only wants a trim and a tidy. I think I've only ever seen her blink twice. She could be really low, or really high, I don't know, either way, she has issues. Then there's Pixie. That's obviously not her real name but it's all she's given us. Apparently she works in stand-up comedy, but in my experience that's the only joke she's ever told. - You alright? - Yeah. No sorry, just because you said she was a comedian. - That's funny. - Uh huh. - Shall I carry on? - Yes please. Alright. Just this morning I thought I was gonna lose my job and now I'm a junior stylist with my own clients and everything. It's like a dream. I don't know how to thank you Ghillie. I couldn't have done it without you. Are you... Do you have somewhere to stay? I normally sleep in the park. - Is that your home? - No. My home's in the forest, remember? - Which forest? - What do you mean? - What's its name? - I don't know. You don't know where your home is? No. Well, you're welcome to stay in the living room for a while if you like? So, make yourself at home. There's the couch and I've got some spare bedding or a sleeping bag or... Em, those are my plants... Or you could just do that. It's not like me to be nosy I like to keep out of other people's business but I can't help seeing what I'm seeing and that garden of hers is an eyesore, I mean how hard is it to tidy it up every now and again and the really worrying thing, and I know it's nothing to do with me, but she seems to have an awful lot of male visitors. So I said to her the other day, I said, - Mother, we really need to... - Mrs. Rainey. - Yes, m'love. - What is it you're looking for - today? - Oh, Amelia, yoohoo! Could you give this youngster a few tips about how I like my - hair? - Of course, Victoria. What? What's wrong? Nothing, I... Please, take a seat, Victoria. I will not. Tell me why you made that noise? I thought there was something on your head. - But it was my mistake. - On my head? What do you mean? Where? Are you sure? I can't feel anything! - What are you talking about? - Brussels! Oops. How is everything today, Miss Cameron? Are you perfectly happy with the service you're receiving? Because, you know, unless I hear that you're completely satisfied, I will have to assume that your stylist isn't quite up to standard. Is there a problem? Your hair is alive. This isn't working. You're getting in everybody's way. It's like there's two of you or something. I don't know what it is but something about your presence makes people uneasy. What do you want me to do? You can move into the back room. You want me to serve customers from a cupboard? I want you to do as you are told. And if I hear a complaint from any of your clients I will have no choice but to fire you. - Do you understand? - Yes. Good. Get out. Pixie! Welcome. - Hi. - Hi. Em... Yeah, so, you will be in the back room today. I hope that's okay with you? Uh huh. Where's that? Eh... well, it's in the back. And if you're at all dissatisfied for any reason, you be sure to let me know. - So how was everything? - Great, thanks. That new stylist is incredible. I'll definitely be combing hair again. - Pardon? - Combing hair again. Do you get it? It's a joke! A few months ago I kinda hit the 50 followers mark. I knew it! Are you insane? I will be contacting Valerie about this mark my words! And I'll be posting about it. Hashtag unprofessional! Yeah I think this is exactly what Valerie wants to be doing more of. Giving innovative young stylists the chance to get creative and be surprising. And change the whole way we style our own hair. There's so much buzz about her here in the United States. And she's so young! Jessie, I hope you don't mind. I made your face. Eh, okay. Is that... Is that me? That's amazing. I had no idea this is what you were making. Thanks Ghillie. Do you remember now? Remember what? You have a new client. Another celebrity. Big surprise. We'll have to cut one of your others to make room. Who do you want to lose? Well? Come on I don't have... Good morning Amelia. Valerie! I'm so sorry. I... I thought you were... I didn't know you were coming. Well I prefer to keep my visits unannounced. Hi, you wanted to... - Mum! - Hello Jessie. - What are you doing here? - I've heard such good reports about this branch I've decided to move back up to be more involved in its development. Really? Wow... Thats... That's... That's great. So we're gonna be working together? No, I'll mostly be working with Amelia. Ha... Of course. - But... - Yes? Well... Nothing. You wanted to see me? I, eh, yes... You have a new client. Oh. Who is it? So... I wanted to have a completely fresh start but it needed to be the absolute best, you know. I can't just go to anyone. Then out of the blue everyone starts raving about this new stylist at Valerie's. And who does it turn out to be? The girl I met on the street. So I thought that's it. She's the one. Oh, wow. Ow... Alright! Straight in there. Quite a grip you've got. Yeah, sorry, I can be much more gentle. No, no, no, you just do what you need to do. So yeah I em... I never really forgot that meeting and eh... and I was just wondering if, you know, maybe you remembered it too? No! What is that? Feels weird. Yeah, it's a... special product. Sorry, you were saying? No. It's fine. I didn't really expect you to remember. It's not like I thought about it that much really. But I did wonder if I'd ever see you again. Ow! Oh, wow. You do not mess around! Yeah, sorry, I don't know what's got into me today. No, no, no, don't apologise. You just... just go for it. I really think there is potential to expand here and as you've already shown recruitment is absolutely key. We need to investigate that further so I will need access to your accounts so I can drill down from - top level reports. - No. - I beg your pardon? - You don't need to. I can get you that information. No, I will need full access to all that data myself. Amelia? You okay? Yes, sorry, it's just... it's so surreal. You, Valerie. Here in my office. Amelia, if we could just stay focussed. Yes, of course. And I just realised I didn't offer you anything to drink. Can I get you a tea? A coffee? No, but I will need you to get rid of all these plants. Oh yes, sorry about the flowers they are in need of a bit of TLC but don't worry I'll get them perked up. No plants. I want them gone now. Do you understand? - Sweet. - You like it? Oh yeah. You have a gift. - No, not really. - Oh, come on. You're amazing. I knew it from the moment we met. What was that? Oh, nothing, but you know you should probably go because it's closing time. Okay, but, I was going to ask, would you like to... Ooh, got some stuff that I need to be sorting out. Well, nice to see you. Wait! Can I take you out for dinner sometime? Dinner. Yeah. Dinner sounds great. When's good for you? Friday? Friday. Friday is great. You really need to go now. I'll see you then. Bye! - What has got into you? - I don't like him. - He has a bad smell. - What? He smells great. In fact I'm pretty sure that was Moss. - What is going on in here? - I was just doing some sorting. - Who were you talking to? - Eh, myself. You may think this is some sort of joke but I know you're hiding something and sooner or later I'll find out what it is. - Then we'll see who's laughing. - Wait! - Is my... Valerie still here. - No, she left half an hour ago. Did she say where she was staying? - You don't know? - No. I only found out she moved up. Well, as it happens, yes, she gave me her address. But that's classified information. I couldn't possibly share it with other employees. That would be a breach of confidentiality. Terribly sorry. I'm aware this is unconventional but I need you to shed some light on a few potentially sensitive anomalies in the accounts. I think first we should talk about Jessie. - What about her? - Ever since she first started I've been sensing something strange about the way she works. I'm not sure what it is exactly but - she's hiding something. - And you're not? - Excuse me? - Amelia. I have asked you to meet me here to have an open and frank discussion. Now, I need you to be very honest with me. Have you or have you not been defrauding the salon? I don't know what you're talking about. Fine. Then explain these inconsistencies. Well... I... First, you explain why your daughter is being so secretive. - That is totally unrelated. - Is it? Is it really? Because I think I see exactly what's going on here. - Amelia, calm down. - No, I will not! This is what I knew would happen from the moment I hired her. It's nepotism, that's what it is. - This is nothing to do with... - No, I won't stand for it! This is unfair treatment of staff. It's discrimination. I know you and your daughter are up to something and I'm going to prove it. I quit! She quit? - Did she say why? - Well, I think... I think she felt it was the right time to move on. Wow. So who's going to be taking over? Well, I'll be stepping in for the time being Olly will continue as senior stylist and he suggested that you join him in the role. Me? Senior stylist? - I'm too young. - Jessie, you clearly have talent and vision. The rest can be learned on the job. - Are you serious? - Yes. So I'd be working with you? - To begin with, yes. - That would be amazing. So you accept? Okay, let's do it! Excellent. Right, well, I'll em... I'll sort out the formalities and update the staff and we can meet tomorrow and plan further. Oh, you can go now. Jessie. Where did you get that necklace? Eh... I don't remember. Well, I'd like you to stop wearing it. - Why? - Just stop wearing it, thanks. I wish I didn't have to but she just doesn't like it for some reason. Once I'm a few days into my new job I'll explain everything to her. As soon as the time is right. I promise. Okay? Also, I have my date with Tyler tonight and I was kinda hoping to get my hair done by the best stylist in the world. Ghillie, I would really like your help. Please? You're done? Are you kidding? I can't go out like this. Ghillie, I don't have time for messing around. Thanks for nothing. I'll do it myself. He's here. - Hey. - Hi. Two seconds I'm nearly ready. You can come in if you like? Thanks. Ghillie, what are you doing? You can't just slam the door in someone's face. Do you know how rude that is? Let me open it. Sorry about that. Em, I can actually come just now. Ghillie! I'm serious. Let him in. Really do apologise... Must definitely get this fixed! Ah, good. Right. Eh, shall we? Don't worry, Ghillie. We're gonna have a wild night. First, you can help me test all my lights. And then, we can repair some inner tubes. Well, I think inner tubes are really fun. We've barely spoken in like three years and now we're going to be working together. It's crazy. It's like everything I've ever dreamed of is happening all at once and I didn't... Sorry. I'm talking too much. No. Please, carry on. It's great. I feel like I'm getting to know the real Jessie Macrae with all her secrets and quirks. - Quirks? - Yeah. You know, like the way you just go for it when you're styling. Or that thing with the boxes. Or tonight, with the door. I see. I'm sorry. - I'm not normally like that. - No, no, no, don't apologise. It's good. It's unique. It's you. Yeah, but it's not really though is it. Yes it is. You're quirky. And I like it. Sorry. Don't worry. I'll get you another one. Oi! What's wrong with you, mate? Watch where you're... Ah! What was that? There's something under the table, it just bit me. Can you see it? No, please don't! - You're ruining everything! - What? No, not you, it's me. It's my fault. I'm sorry. Just give me a sec. What is wrong with you, you're acting like a total maniac! Hello? Did you hear that? I said I'm really angry! You can't just go around assaulting people. But it's him. I told you, he has a bad smell. No, he smells great! You're the one that smells bad. Now I'm going to have to go back in there and make amends for your mess, and you're gonna go home and have a serious - think about your behaviour. - But, you don't understand... No, that's it! I don't want to talk about it any more. Go home! Can you believe that waiter? Must've been on something. I think he put some in my drink an' all, 'cos I feel really weird. Whoa, there! You okay? I am now. Well, thanks Tyler. It's been really nice. Goodnight, Tyler. So, eh, I'll see you tomorrow night? I can't do tomorrow. - Next week? - Yeah. Maybe. Maybe? - What d'you mean, maybe? - Well, I have to check. I'm busy with work. You're busy with work? D'you know how many girls would kill to be where you are right now? But I'm not asking them. I'm asking you. Let go, you're hurting me. Come on. Don't ruin the night. - Let go! - Don't you know who I am? What are you? Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Ghillie? Ghillie! Ghillie. I don't understand. She's changed. Everything's so different from how it was before. What am I supposed to do? Ah, women, eh. What's any of us supposed to do? They're a mystery. Life moves on and people change. At the end of the day it comes down to a choice. You choose each other... or you don't. All you can do is remind her what it was like at the beginning. Show her you still love her. Then let her choose. Ghillie! What have you done? Mum'll freak out if she sees this. We have to clean this up now! Oh no. Jessie, what's going on? It's okay, I can explain. This is gonna sound crazy but just hear me out. This wasn't me, but I know who it was. - I should've told you before. - Told me what? I'm not who people think I am. I'm not the one who's been coming up with the crazy styles. - It was all him. - Who? He's a boy. Only he's not. I don't know what he is. He's invisible. You can only see him when you're wearing this. Is this some kind of sick joke? A joke? No, it's not a joke. So are you trying to dig up the past to get back at me? No, I'm telling the truth! This is totally unacceptable behaviour from an employee at Valerie's. Not least a senior stylist! Oh would you just forget about the stupid job! Can't you just be my mum, just for a minute? I get that your parents left you to fend for yourself but it doesn't mean you need to do the same to me. I wanted you to achieve some- thing by yourself and you have. Oh, that's all that matters to you, isn't it? Success. Touring the country promoting your oh-so-special business telling the world that inside everyone is beautiful which is a total lie by the way, because you are certainly not. Well, of course it's a lie! - Oh, grow up Jessie. - What? It's a slogan. A marketing tool. What you really think that I believe that inside everyone is beautiful, well, of course not! Most people are ugly and twisted inside, especially my customers, but they are desperate to be told that they are not. And they will pay handsomely for it. So that's what I do. It's called business. I don't get it. If you don't even believe in your own company then why are you giving your life to it? What are you getting out of all this? It's a game, Jessie. You learn the rules sometimes you bend them a little but you have to keep playing if you want to win. - That's how it works. - What are you winning? Money? Fame? Is that it? Is that all you care about? Don't answer it, please don't answer it. I have to, Jessie, it's my board. Mum, please don't! Hello? What? No, no. You can't fire me. This is my company. When? What you really think that I believe that inside everyone is beautiful, well, of course not! Most people are ugly and twisted inside especially my customers, but they are desperate to be told that they are not. And they will pay handsomely for it. What. How is that possible? There's no one else here. Well, it's from your account. - What? - You did this. How? You've been with me the whole time! This was your plan all along. You wanted to ruin me. No, that's not true. Mum, the video's got nothing... No! You are not my daughter. Please leave me alone. I don't want to see you anymore. Hey, you're back early. D'you find Ghillie? Well... I did what you said. I tried to remind her of how it was at the beginning and she told me to leave her alone. - Oh well, that's a shame. - I don't know what to do next. She's so sad and I think it's my fault. I can't help you anymore, alright? I need to stop listening to you. You're not real. - I am real! - No, you're not! How can you be real? I've never even seen you! You're just a voice in my head. I want you to get out! That's it. I know what to do. Thank you, Beard Man, goodbye! Mum, I'm so sorry. I never meant for it to happen. Can't we start again? Ghillie? Ghillie. What are you doing here? Ghillie, what do you want? You can't just come back like nothing's happened. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I just wanted it to be like it was in the beginning. I know. I know you didn't mean for things to turn out the way they did. I'm sorry too. I said some really horrible things. What's going on? It's the middle of the night. Wait? Is that the necklace? Is Ghillie back? - I'm here! - Ghillie! We missed you! I thought you were gone forever. What brought you back? I had an idea. To put things right. - Sounds great! - What do you mean? If your mother sees me she'll understand. She'll stop being angry at you she just needs to wear the necklace. - Hey, that could work. - I already tried that and she totally lost it. She doesn't want anything to do with the necklace. Then we put it on her when she's not looking. - Yeah! - Ghillie, I know you're just trying to help but some things just can't be fixed. She doesn't want anything to do with me. - We have to try. - Jessie, he's right. You can't just give up on her. Isn't it at least worth a shot? Me and Ghillie will help. Thanks, Sal. But I don't think... I can provide bikes if you need transportation. You can have the duck egg blue Amsterdam cruiser and me and Ghillie will use the tandem. Except the back seat will need adjusted and the tyres need air and actually the brakes are dodgy so never mind the tandem. Okay, the only issue is I don't know where my mum is staying. There's only one person that does so that's gonna be our first challenge. Why, who is it? Jessie! Amelia, I really need my mum's address. It's important. - No. - Amelia, please! Don't you ever come here again. Not the friendliest, is she? - It's my fault. - It's not your fault, Ghillie. - I frightened her at night. - You didn't frighten... Wait, at night? When did you see her night? When I was making the shelter? - In the salon? - Yes. What was she doing in the salon at night? She was putting a little black ball in the corner. - Oh no she didn't. - I don't believe it. - Proper psycho. - Why would she do that? - Was it my fault? - Wait. I've got an idea. Do you want me to call the police? Sure. Go ahead. Or we will. - Excuse me? - We know it was you. - What? - We know it was you that planted the camera and posted the video under a false identity we have every reason to report you now, but we won't, if you tell us my mum's address. - Also we don't have all day. - Let's just report her. Alright! It's 22 Rowan Road West Greenway. Thank you. Say sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Nice one, Ghillie. Let's go. It looks like nobody's in. Maybe we should come back another time? No way. We've come this far. You're not chickening out now. Don't be a Jessy, Jessie. We'll be right behind you. I don't think she's here. Maybe it's the wrong house. Looks totally empty. Oi! Can I help you? Do you know when we might be able to catch Valerie? - My friend here's her... - Colleague. Work colleague. Oh, colleague, eh? Didn't you hear? Her daughter pulled some sort of crazy stunt. Posted a video on the Internet of her bad-mouthing her own company. She's moved to the States or somewhere. So you can clear off! Jessie... Jessie, I'm sorry. Thank you, Sal. Thank you, Ghillie. Thank you for trying. Thank you. It's you. You're real. I missed you Ghillie. I've found you. I've been away too long. The forest needs me. Uh. I wish I could stay. I just got you back. I'll always remember you. Thank you, Ghillie. We had a plan we'd pack our bags and run away We said goodbye to yesterday Oh, didn't you say But we weren't lost Oh, no more tear drops on the map We'll find our way there's no turning back But you didn't really mean that And now here we are Still just counting on the same dumb star Wondering where the hell the wild things are No we never meant to go this far No oh oh So tell me we're nearly home - Mum. - I'm probably the last person you want to see right now but I just need to say two things. Firstly, I'm sorry. I let the hurt of my past push us apart and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. And secondly... a mutual friend sends his regards. Would you like to come in? And that is the story of how Ghillie Dhu brought my mum back to me. We haven't seen him since but we know he's out there somewhere and one day we'll meet again. That was beautiful.
