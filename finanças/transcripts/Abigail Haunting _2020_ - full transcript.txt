Man, stopping here was a bad idea. We gotta get our shit and get outta here. Roger? He didn't give me a choice. We talked about this. I'm doing this for you. What are you doing, Katie? What the fuck do you think you're doing? I'm not doing this with you. What are you doing, Katie? Marge, you got groceries here. Who's that man? Your boyfriend? When's the last time you got out of this place? Looks like you could use some help around here. Yeah, serious help. Why don't you eat something? I, uh, I'm gonna stay for a few days, if that's okay. I figured you could use the help. Katie Frederick, - oh my goodness. - What? You're a doctor now? No, but I could easily fool people. Uh, medical records at Trinity. How are you, come here. Really, it's good to see ya. Gav, come here, bud. This is Gavin. Hi, Gavin. Is this your son? Has it really been that long? Sit over there, bud, thanks. What are you doing back in Prescott? I just thought I'd visit Marge. How did you know I was back? Well, uh, the car out front. - Yeah. - No, I mean my parents still live in a house off Watson Lake, so we're driving by here all the time. What are you guys doing tomorrow night? I don't think anything. Wanna grab a bite or something? I could swing by, pick you up at, like, six? Uh, why don't we do here? I gotta keep close for Marge. Do you still drink beer? Or did you go all fancy on me? Yeah, yeah, I still drink beer. Man, okay, so I'll pick us something up. - I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - Yeah. With beers. It's great to see you. Come on, bud. I had the game in the back. - The game, yes. - Yep. It was, don't tell me, it was... - I'm not telling you. - Stratego. Stratego. No, not telling you. Shut up. Gosh, Katie, you know nothing about me. Whatever, you're like four years older than me. That's, like, that's old. How am I supposed to know what old guys like? Well, I remember that you didn't like girly stuff. Yeah. Like, um, dressing up. You didn't even go to your prom, did you? I didn't, no. Gavin. I remembered something about you. You were into, um, you were into Gaelic football. Whatever the hell that was. I'm just more so can't believe that that's all that you can come up with. But wow. All bullshit aside, how is Reno? It's like here, but with casinos. Gavin. Something has gone wrong. Did you ever find your real mom? No, nothing ever came up. Waste of money. Dang, sorry. It's okay, I hardly, I didn't even know her. I never knew the woman. I just, she gave me up when I was like four weeks old, so, doesn't matter. Not anymore. What's up with Marge? She's really deteriorated. I hadn't seen her in years. I know what happened to her. Yeah, well, you're not missing out. She was never the most likable person. She made my life hell. It's right over here. No, no, and I'm offended by your question. That was in high school. Come here. Let me show you something. Let me show you something. So why come back? Just, um, say it's transition. I'm not staying long. Well, boyfriend? Ex-husband? What dark secrets do you have? Wouldn't be a secret if I told you. But how 'bout you? When's the last time Gavin's seen his mom? Christmas. She pops in now and again. Things didn't go so well between us. Worst part is she just takes it out on Gavin, you know? It's right over here. What's it like being back in the old trailer house? No offense, but this place really creeped me out - as a kid. - I know, me, too. It still does. This place has never been right. I really hated living here. You know what I just thought of? What? Been out in the shed yet? No. You're an adult now. It's still Marge's house, it's still her rules. I don't have any reason to go in there. Well, you know what? It's probably where she buried all the other foster kids she took in, so you're the lucky one. Well, this place has secrets for sure. It's like something is always watching. It was like that when I was a kid. It's still like that now. As creepy as this place was, Marge always scared me more. No! Gavin? Gav? Hi, what are you doing, bud, what is that? It's a mask. Someone made it. Okay. This isn't your house. You can't just be going through people's stuff, okay? It's all right, Gavin. Do you wanna try it on? Okay, well, it looks great, Gavin, but let's go put it back where we got it. You know, I made that when I was a kid, Gavin. It was my way of hiding from the world. I could put it on and disappear. Go put it back, dude. He can have it. Thanks, but no thanks. We got enough crap at home to play with. Then maybe you should wear it. Come on, you need to eat something, dude. Get some food in ya. Marge! Marge, you locked the door again. Marge, open the door! Marge! Marge, open the goddamn door. Marge. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm just dropping off some groceries for Margo. My name's Walter. You look familiar, though. I think I've seen you come in and outta here a few years ago. Yeah, Marge is my foster mom, what does she owe you? It's okay, it's what I do. It's all right. Marge, you gotta stop locking the door. I was right outside. No one's gonna come in. Do you hear me, Marge? Hi. Hey. Don't you have to work? Well, I would, but I took the day off. Gavin's with my mom. What are you doing, Brian? What do you mean? Do you got any good tools in your truck? Good to go. Hey, can I ask you something real quick? Do you ever miss Gavin's mom? Like, is it hard being a single parent? You adjust. I just, I just wonder why my mom couldn't do it. Not everyone's cut out to be a parent, you know? All right, I'm gonna swing by tonight, pick you up. We're gonna grab some food and get the hell outta here. No, not tonight. Still feeling antisocial and stubborn? Bring something here. All right. Okay. Marge. Marge, come on, sit up. Marge, come on, Marge, I have to get you up. Oh God, you have to get off! Marge is choking. She's fine. Where have you been all your lives? Okay. What's going on, Katie? Can I call you tomorrow? Are you okay? Yeah. Call me tomorrow, okay. What are you doing, Katie? Hey. How long have you been doing this? A long time. I lost count. Why do you do this? How she doing, anyway? Look, how do you know Marge? Well, Margie and me, we're old friends. I don't remember you. Well, see, I was away for a while. And then I moved back about a year ago after my wife passed. Margaret and I are very close. But her health just took a turn for the worse and she won't leave this house. Why? Can I give you some advice? Nothing good ever came out of this place. I'd leave this house and go as far away as you can. Who's in here? I know someone's in here. Shit. What do you see? Must have been a coyote or something. It wasn't, it wasn't a coyote. Yeah, well, whatever it was, you're lucky I had the day off. Sure. You know, maybe you dropped your phone outside or something. I didn't drop it outside. There was someone in there. Katie, come on. I'm not gonna keep trying to convince you, Brian. What's the real reason you came back? I've been asking myself that for days now. Don't you have Dad duties you should be doing? The old mask, huh? What? You're hiding. This time, you're not wearing your mask. Yeah, I really appreciate you coming by. But it is not dead. Maybe you should try something different, huh? Hiding doesn't seem to be helping you out. Yeah, well I don't need your advice or help or whatever. Okay, you sure about that? I just remember trying to leave the apartment and he hit me from behind hard, to like the back of neck, I think. I don't know. But I blacked out. I guess when I, when I fell, my coat hooked on to the railing of the steps or something, luckily, cause it saved me from falling down the steps. Neighbor girl found me hanging there and woke me up. Must've been out like an hour or something. How long this go on for? About a year after we started dating. I had to get out. I'm pretty sure he would've killed me. I wish you would've reached out sooner. Does he know where you are? No. He won't be bothering me again. I made sure of it. Right. Yeah. No more secrets. Sure. We need to get out of the house. You need to get out of the house. Okay. Look, look, there's a farmer's market in town. It might be good for you to get out for an hour or so, get some fresh air. How is this healthy? Just sitting around here. It is, it's her fault. It's her fault, it is. Okay, I'm getting you out of... Save yourself. You need to leave this house right now. You need to leave this house. You need to leave this house now. Hello. Katie? Who is this? Katie. Hello? Who's calling me? - Katie? - Yes, who is this? It's Gavin. Gavin, what's going on, how did you get this number? Where's your dad? Katie. Gavin, what is it? What's wrong? She wants you to see it. She's coming for you, Katie. I swear, it was him, Brian. Why would he call you? He's been with my mom all weekend. Okay, forget it then. - Forget it. - Look, okay, I'll call him and ask him, but you gotta get outta this house, okay? You're going crazy. No, I'm not up for it. Well, I don't care, I'm not taking no for an answer. Get your shit, let's go. What's up, Hank? What's up? This is a bad idea. You need some whisky. What can I get ya, huh? Something harder. What's up, boys? I should've asked before I drank that. You know, I made that when I was a kid, Gavin. It was my way of hiding from the world. I could put it on and disappear. Help me! Help me! No, please, please. What do you want from me? What do you want? What do you want? She was in here. She was in here, I saw her. Brian, she was in her. What are you talking about? Who was in here? It was her. She was in her with me! Is everything cool here, man? Give us a sec. Let me know if you need anything. Yeah. She was in here with me, goddamn it! I know what I fucking saw! Brian, I'm not making it up! Come on. Katie. Go home, Brian. Did you see her? What did you say? Marge. You said something. You go into my room? Marge? I know you took it. I know you've been in my room. I left you something in the bag. I think you should have it. The other day, you said something to me. You warned me to leave. What do you know about this house? Marge? Just look in the bag. What are these for? You get these in the mail? How old was she? Who's Abigail? Who is she? Is she another kid that you fucked up in the head? Marge, Marge, what happened to her? What happened to her? Marge! Answer me! What happened in the shed? She's back. You have what you wanted. Now leave me alone. She blames me now. I did what I had to do. She blames me now. That goddamned child. Why can't you forgive me? I said I was sorry. Why? What is this? I'm sorry about the other night. Brian, why are you doing this? I was gonna try to prove you wrong, that's why. Whatever you saw, whatever it was, a lot of people in this town have stories about that family. Brian, it doesn't matter. Just look at it, please. Marge had another foster kid before you. She went missing, they think she ran away. Do you know anything about that? I asked my dad if he knew anything. He said not many people in town remember much about the girl. When she went missing, people blamed Marge for the whole thing. She's been carrying that around with her ever since. I hate to ask, but do you think that's why Marge fostered you? It's like maybe she felt some kind of guilt or, like, obligation to make it right. I have to get out of here. Marge? Marge! Marge. I know what you did. What's up, dude, how was the weekend? Gav, can I ask you something? Hey, excuse me. I'm talking to you. I know what you did. She didn't run away. She killed herself, and you said nothing. You stuffed her in that fucking shed like a piece of trash. Gavin, did you call Katie's cellphone this past weekend? Why did you hide this? Why didn't you just go to the police? What, you afraid you'd lose all your money? What is it? The girl in the shed told me to. You know what, go back inside of your grandma's, okay? I'll be back in a little bit. They wouldn't let you be a foster mom, would they, if they knew you let a kid kill herself on your watch? She wouldn't let me. It's all my fault. It's too young to be a mother. Why not me? Why was she so special? It wasn't fair. I deserved that baby. Why didn't the baby want my body? Why not me? Oh my God. Abigail was pregnant. What did you do with the baby? What did you do with Abigail's baby? Walter. Walter? What? Walter what? What did you do with Abigail's baby? Marge! This was a mistake. This was a mistake. You deserve this, you deserve to be trapped in this fucking, miserable house. So do you. Here, with your mother Abigail. She's back. You have a child. Now leave me alone. Marge. Katie! Katie! He'll let you go. I can't let you go. Katie! Katie! Katie! Are you in here? Katie, open up! Are you okay? I'll be right back! Help me. Katie, I'm coming! I'm coming! Katie, hang on! Hang on, Katie! Brian, help me! Please, help me, she made me do it. All right, come on, come on. Hey, what, what's going on? Where is she? Who are you? Where the fuck is she, man? No, no, no, listen, we gotta move, man. - You better move your ass... - Or what? What are you gonna do? Katie, get out of the truck. Okay. What do you want? Katie. What the hell do you want from us, huh? Stop talking. Stay outta this. Look, look, we gotta move. I promise you, the cops are on their way. Okay, we'll settle this later. Where is it? Get out of the truck. Stay in the truck, Katie. Are you for real, man? You that stupid? You don't understand... No! You don't understand! I'll shoot you in your fucking face. Where is the money? I don't have it, Roger. See, yeah, see, she's lying. That's what she's best at. Well, if you don't have it, I guess there's no reason for any of us to make it out of this, is there, huh? It's in there, it's in there. Katie, no, no! Shut up. Get it. Hurry. Look, if you, if you come inside that house, I'll shoot her. If you call the cops, - I'll shoot her. - I'm not, I'm not. Move! Leave her, leave her alone! No. No. No. Shit! - Get it, hurry. - It's in here. I'm not sure where it is. I think I might've put it in here. Stop fucking around. Okay. It's in here. That the new boyfriend? You just leave him alone. He's a little outta your league. He has nothing to do with this. If he's still out front, I'm gonna have to kill him. That, I promise you. I'm shocked you didn't spend it all. You got what you want, now leave. I don't know, Katie. Do I kill you or make you come with me? I'm not going anywhere with you. You really fucked everything up. I'm glad I never taught you how to shoot. Wait, wait. Wait, don't do it. I'm pregnant, Roger. What? Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? Jesus, with my kid? You're lying. You would, you would keep this from me? My own kid. Don't make me drag you from this house. I told you before, I'm not doing this with you. We're leaving. I'm not leaving. None of us are. No! Take it easy, young man. It's too late. She belongs to the house now.
