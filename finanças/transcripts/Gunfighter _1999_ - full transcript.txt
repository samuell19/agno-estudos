( insects chirping ) A cow pie. Great. That's just great. ( hinges squeak ) Hello? -( wings flapping ) -Is there anybody here? Hello? I'm supposed to do a gig here tonight. ( piano music playing ) Well, that's just my luck. I get booked in a ghost town. I gotta get a new agent. ( piano music stops ) ( spurs jingling ) ( sniffs ) ( runs piano keys ) You don't look like Ragtime Cowboy Joe to me. Excuse me? Ragtime Cowboy Joe-- I heard he was gonna pound some gut on the piano here tonight. Well, I don't know where Ragtime Cowboy Joe is. All I know is I drove four hours through that miserable fog to be here for a measly 75 bucks. And from the looks of it, I don't think I'm gonna make a cent. Where is everybody? I reckon they're where they ought to be. ( chuckles ) Well, you and Cowboy Joe have yourselves a good night. I'm out of here. You ain't good plucking that thing? ( snorts ) Now, if I was any good, do you think I'd be playing here? I'm washed up. I haven't been able to write a new song in years. Maybe what you need is just a new yarn to spin. Maybe all you're lacking is some inspiration. - What's the matter, son? - Nothing. I just-- I mean, your hand moved so fast, it looked like-- I mean, I thought for a second you were one of those old-time gunslingers. It's just you're so quick. Why don't you sit a spell? ( sighs ) Why not? A gunslinger, huh? Imagine that. How-- how'd you do that? How did you get those gloves to shine like that? I'll make a deal with you, son. I'll fill you in on those gloves; when I'm done, you'll sing me a song. How'd that be? I don't know, mister. The truth of the matter is, I ain't played in a while. Why is that? I guess I lost something-- my courage, maybe. Hmm. Courage is a powerful thing, but it ain't something a man loses. It just gets... misplaced sometimes. You asked me about these gloves. Now, there's a story of courage right there. Did you know legend has it that whoever wore these gloves was the fastest draw in the West? It's true. On the right man, those gloves stood for law and order. If the wrong man got a hold of them, there'd be hell to pay. Some men-- bad men-- would even kill for the right to wear those gloves, like the day the man in black rode into town. ( horses neighing ) ( dogs barking ) Get you some corn whisky? Rye. Another. So what brings y'all to these parts, mister? Business. Ahem. You seem mighty interested in that picture. Damnedest gunfighter ever seen in the West-- Hopalong Cassidy. This town is sort of his birthplace. Saved a marshal, took a bullet in the hip doing so. Barkeep: Call him Hopalong Cassidy ever since. To Hopalong. Men: To Hoppy. To Hopalong Cassidy. To Hopalong. Damn straight shooter. To Hoppy the gunfighter. Ain't no room in this town for your kind, Tex. Decision's mine, Mr. Limp. ( crows cawing ) ( crowd laughing ) Well, you're a babe with a gun, Tex. You best take a good 40 years to practice up. You're gonna wish you killed me. To Hoppy. ( laughing ) I don't care much for laughing. Didn't mean nothing, mister. How far to the Bar 20? Bar 20? Head south. You'll get there by this evening. Thank you. ( steer snorting ) Hot iron. ( moos ) Watch that damn thing. I don't wear no tattoo. Quit your yapping, Red. I just thought you's a cow. Your butt's as big as one. Lanky, you're skinnier than a coyote's whisker and you stink so damn bad we could burn you for fuel. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - ( hoofbeats approaching ) - Billy, what's your hurry? - Hey, Tumblebug. - Billy: Got the mail. Mighty good roundup this year. We've branded 500 head of the finest, healthiest beef I've ever seen. They're walking gold, Mary. Well, that's just fine, Uncle Buck. -( horses neighing ) -( chickens clucking ) - Hello, Mary. - Howdy, Billy. - Howdy, Billy. - Hello, Mr. Peters. Here's your mail. It's Buck, Billy-- Buck. You've been working here long enough. Been good work too. Well, I got a lot more work to do, so I'd better go back to it. Take care, Mr. Peters-- I mean, Buck. - Take care, Mary. - See you, Billy. Is there a letter from Hopalong, Uncle Buck? Nope. Damn him. He's been away six months and hasn't written me once. Oh, Mary, Hopalong is not too good with words. He's just-- well, he's just plain shy. He's told me how he feels about you. And it's more warm than cold. Really? What did he say? Well, he said-- oh, Mary, I can't remember. He gave you that scarf you're wearing. Uncle Buck, you're just trying to shut me up. ( Buck chuckles ) ( voices overlapping ) ( voices overlapping ) How'd your day go today? Billy, take care of my horse, would you? - Thank you, Red. - We ought to play poker later. - Poker? No. - Cookie: 'Evening, boys. - Howdy, you old blind bat. - Cookie, you got any of them good beans? - What've you got? Stew? - Yeah, we got a little stew. Aww, this stew tastes the same every night. Oh-ho! It's definite. Old McAllister's buying all Bar 20 cattle this year, at top-dollar prices too. This deal is sealed, little Mary. Aww. You know what? I'm gonna buy you something nice. What are you gonna buy me? Oh, something. Well, I'm going out to the boys. I want to tell them the good news. ( voices overlapping ) Well, we got 50 head rounded up in the east canyon. Part of that Lizard's Belly, Jimmy. 'Evening, Buck. 'Evening, Buck. 'Evening, boys. Well, I've got good news. But before I tell it, there's something I'd like to say. This roundup's moving like clockwork. Uh... I know you all have been a-sweatin', working hard, 'cause there's more than one cow out there on the range. - ( all chuckle ) - Well, I appreciate that. Uh... this place wouldn't be the great Bar 20 that it is if it wasn't for all of you. Oh, no place we'd rather be working. That's right. We're all your sons, Buck. Damn right. Man: Come on now, Buck. What's the good news? I know. Hopalong's coming back. All right, Hoppy! No, not yet, Billy, but soon. No, the good news is that McAllister's buying all Bar 20 cattle this year. There'll be a raise of $5 a month for every last one of you. - ( shouts ) - ( gunshots ) Whoo-hoo! Man: Your turn, Buck. Coming on down mighty fast. - ( gun clicks ) - Hell, I'm out of ammo. Buck! - ( man yells ) - ( Buck laughs ) Man: ♪ Old Bill Jones ♪ Had two daughters and a son ♪ ♪ One went to Denver ♪ And the other went wrong ♪ ♪ His wife, she died ♪ In a poolroom fight ♪ And still he sings ♪ From morning till night ♪ ♪ Oh, when I die ♪ Take my saddle from the wall ♪ ♪ Put it on my pony ♪ And lead him from the stall... ♪ Wait here, boys. ( chuckling ) The great Bar 20. I'll bury it 10 feet under. Sorry, Mr. Cassidy. We strike tonight. Hyah! ( dogs baying ) I want to see your cards, Lanky. I think you're cheating a little bit. Good shot. Hey, quit blowing our bunkhouse to bits. It's cold out there. - Oh, hell, Red. - ( two gunshots ) Jimmy and I are just practicing for this year's rodeo, being that Hopalong ain't gonna come back. Ain't that right, Jimmy? You bet. We can shoot. Deacon, you get the herd. Feret, get me the girl. I want her alive, Feret. Adios, Bar 20. ( popping loudly ) ( mooing ) Stampede! Stampede! Try to hold them, Pete! - ( gunshot ) - Shorty. Hang on, Pete! ( screams ) Pete! Argh! - Wah-hoo! - ( gunshots ) Yah! Yah! Wah-hoo! Yah! The herd's on the run. Okay, come on, Johnny. Let's give Shorty and Pete a hand. Billy, get your rifle. ( grunts ) Go ahead, Lanky. Cookie and I will keep 'em busy. ( grunts ) Kill them all! Mary, hide under your bed. There's trouble. - You know I can shoot. - Just do as I say. I ain't hiding under no bed. Uncle Buck! Uncle Buck! Uncle Buck! Let me go. Why don't you act like men? Afraid I'll skin your hides? ( spits ) Cowards. Shut up, bitch. Put her to sleep! Take her back to Tex. ( chuckles ) ( gunfire continues ) ( horses neighing ) ( Feret laughing ) It's over! The place is damned! Ugh! Buck. ( coughing ) Billy, ride to the Double Y. Get Hopalong. Don't you die, Buck. He ain't dead, Billy. We'll doctor him up. They killed all the horses. Whoa. My horse. Whoa, son. Easy. Red, Lanky, get my saddle. ( crackling, popping ) Hah! Billy's gone to get Hopalong. Them dirty bastards will be shitting rail iron when Hopalong Cassidy hears about this. - I won't rest till every one of them are dead. - You're damn right. Three of the boys got killed that night. Buck got shot. Johnny was stabbed. Cattle was all rustled and all the horses were burned alive. Damn. What kind of man would do a thing like that? What kind of man, indeed? What are you hiding in that case there? ( whistles ) That's a beaut. Yeah. This little Gibson is about the only thing I got left that's worth much. She's like an old friend to me. ( plays blues melody ) We have made some beautiful music together. Sounds pretty good to me. ( chuckles ) Hey, what happened to Mary anyway? Was she all right? Where was Hopalong? Well, here's how that went. Mary got kidnapped by Tex and the gang, you know. And they sent Billy down to the Double Y to see if he could find Hoppy. You saved the Double Y, Hoppy. I'd like to give you this horse. You break him, he's yours. I believe I'll take you up on that one. Whoa, boy. Easy. Come here now. Whoa, son. All right. Well, I'll be. If that don't beat all. Appreciate it, Waffles. I believe he's gonna make a good 'un. I think I'll just call him Thunder. Sounds like a good name. - Hopalong! - Billy. What are you doing here? You sound like a damn dog with all that panting. Hopalong, they took Mary, killed Jimmy, Shorty, and Pete and stole all the cattle. Waffles, we need more horses. They killed all ours. Billy, it's the least I can do. Hopalong sacrificed his own ranch to save mine. I'll kill every last one of them. Waffles: Meet up with you later. Hopalong: Who could have done something like this? I should have been here to help, Billy. Hoppy. Best stay the way you are, Johnny. Don't want to open up them wounds. I brought you something-- Mexican specials. Make lying in bed just a little bit easier. Thanks, Hop. Hey, did you square things for the Double Y? Well, they haven't got any more rustlers troubling them. - Cookie. - How are you, Hopalong? How is Buck doing? Well, he's been under, but I think he's coming out of it. Billy got you fast. I should have never left, Buck. It ain't your fault. You did a good friend a favor. They struck like lightning. ( coughing ) We didn't have a chance. I'll get 'em, every last one of 'em. They'll pay for what they've done, I promise you. I know. And there's our posse-- the Bar 20 Three-- and a damn mean one too. Lanky: There is no place them coyotes can hide. When are we leaving? Just as soon as Cookie gets us some traveling grub together. Get them paws a-movin', Cookie. It's all ready, just gotta be loaded on the horses. Let's saddle some of them fine horses. - Hey, Red. - Yo. Bring me back one of them rustlers' ears, will you? I'll bring you home a washtub full, Johnny. ( horses whinnying ) Hopalong, shouldn't I come too? Billy, I need a good man to stay behind. Take care of Buck and Johnny. I'm counting on you. See if you boys can keep up with old Thunder. Yah! - ( men laughing ) - ( Mary moaning ) I want to see you eat your beans, all right? Look, if it was up to me, I'd let you starve. But Tex wants you alive, so eat up. Why don't you just untie me and let me feed myself, huh? ( laughing ) ( spitting ) What I want to do is kill you. ( cocks gun ) I told you I didn't want her touched. Now get out of here. Get your hands off me. Here, let me untie your hands. Why don't you go ahead and eat? I don't have an appetite. Are you all right? I mean, is there something else I can do for you? Yeah. Why don't you just let me go? I'm afraid that's not possible. Then get me Hopalong Cassidy. He'll save me. Hopalong Cassidy. Why, he's probably on our trail right now. What are you smiling about? Do you really think he'll try to save you? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Well, he might come for the cattle. Hey, listen. Hopalong Cassidy is a rogue. I'm a better man than he is. I know how to treat a lady. Why don't you let me take care of you? Don't come near me. You make me sick. Get up. Deacon! Take Miss Meeker away. Gently, Deacon, gently. - ( wings flapping ) - ( bird screeches ) I made a wish for you, Cassidy. ( men snoring ) ( smacking ) - ( snoring continues ) - Oh, boy. - ( gunshot pops ) - What the hell? ( puffs ) What's the matter, Red? Don't you like snaker for breakfast? ( chuckles ) Shit. ( sizzling ) ( screeching ) Whoever they are... they got bad taste in cigars. What the hell is this? Them candles, and now this? You'd think we was chasing some damn parson. Or a bunch of locos. I gave it to Mary before I left. I should have gave her more. There's writing on it. If it's a game they're playing, I'll play it. But they'll wish they never started it. - Whoa, Thunder, whoa. - ( neighing ) Whoa. Just the wind passing through. ( neighs ) - ( gunshots ) - ( horses neighing ) ( man yelping ) ( men laughing ) Dance. Dance, you old bastard. Viejo, tienes customers. Better get their money while they're still alive. Go! What do you fellows want? A little water, some hay. It'll be four bits apiece. Take my advice and you get out of Devil's Bluff. There's some mean hombres in town. ( chickens clucking ) That's all right. We eat mean hombres for breakfast. Water's right over there. Wet them horses' throats and bring them on inside. I'll fill them up with hay. Much obliged. ( mutters ) Good-for-nothing cripple. ( clock ticking ) ( faint footsteps ) ( door squeaks ) Need something? Are you the sheriff? That's right. ( horses neighing ) I like looking at a face when I'm talking to it. I don't like being disturbed, mister. I guess you're ready to see your maker. Well, what can I do for you? I'm after cattle rustlers. You happen to see anything? No. Can't say as I have. You missing cattle? Quite a few. You like cigars? No. Why? Same brand. About that cattle-- we'll keep our eyes peeled. You do that. That's what that badge is for. Nothing worse than a sorry sheriff. Hey, why you boys come so far from home, huh? You should have stayed where your mama could watch over you. Way too dangerous out here. They don't have no mother. One's a pig. The other's a sausage. Let's make them big sausages dance. Hopalong: Looks like you're the ones gonna be doing the jig. ( spits ) He is just a cripple. - ( horse neighing ) - ( dog barking ) Hogging all the fun? We could have handled them. - Maybe so. - Nice shooting, mister. Say, ain't you Hopalong Cassidy? - Red: You're damn right he is. -Well, I'll be graced. Sheriff: You're under arrest. ( cocks gun ) Those men were citizens of this here town. Better put your hands up. Walk off to jail or I'll be forced to pull the trigger. Go ahead. Pull that trigger. ( stammering ) Hey. - ( badge pings ) - Sheriff: No... That old man said a herd of cattle came through Devil's Bluff the other night. 14 men driving them. Yeah, I had a suspicion. He said there was a girl with them too. Thank God. Mary's alive. I love that girl. I'm tired of this herd-driving. ( coyotes yapping ) We could have got rid of some in Devil's Bluff, took our money and split. ( spits ) Tex is just using us. He got some bone to pick with the Bar 20. He's riding us thin. Tex is possessed. You don't want to tangle with him. How about them Bar 20 folk? They're all made of hellfire, especially Hopalong Cassidy. Probably on our trail right now. Plumb gives me the shivers. ( Feret laughing ) ( muffled screams ) ( man laughing ) - ( Mary grunts ) - ( man groans ) Give me a gun and I'll blow you all away! What, to draw? ( groaning ) My mom and pa was killed by Injuns. I survived. I can handle a gun. Oh, yeah, right, poor little papoosie. You bastards. ( spurs jingling ) Well, now, let's see what a good draw she really is. Go ahead, Henry, have a duel. And all I'm trying to do is have a little fun. All right, I'll draw. Argh! I'll cut her up in pieces! I'll cut her heart out! ( gunshot ) Tex: Feret, back off or I'll drop you. You fools should have known better. She's worth more than all of you put together. But what would you expect from a woman that's in love with Hopalong Cassidy? But does he love you? After I'm through with Hopalong, there's always me. ( dog whines, panting ) A wounded dog. Might as well put it out of its misery. Wait. Hello there, boy. - Hello, boy. - ( dog whines ) Boy. ( whines, yelps ) Don't let anybody make fun of you 'cause you limp. ( gun clicks ) Damn sniper. ( gasps ) Hey! ( gunfire whines ) - How many? - Don't know. - Keep me covered. - Gotcha. ( moaning ) - Stop. - Why should I? I lied. I saw your cattle. I was paid to give you trouble. He said he'd kill me if I didn't. - Who? - I don't know. He wore all black. Shango-- he's in the hills. That's where your cattle's gone. Shango? Shango's dead. No, he's been-- ( grunts ) ( coyotes howling ) Red: The wind's blowing the trail away. Ain't nothing to follow. Are we riding into hell just for the fun of it? Hopalong: We don't need a trail no more, Red. We know where we're going. We're heading for the hills to find Shango. That's where the cattle is and maybe Mary. That rustling coyote is supposed to have been dead for years. Hopalong: Doesn't mean he is. Besides, if a fellow wanted to sell stolen cattle fast... You believing that damn sniper? I always believe a dying man. ( spurs jingle ) ( Tex moans ) Hopalong. ( hisses ) ( crows cawing ) ( laughter ) You're a babe with a gun, Tex. You best take a good 40 years to practice up. ( yells ) I'll kill him! ( playing softly ) Tex really had it in for Hoppy, didn't he? Yep. But why? What did Hopalong ever do to him? Well, sometimes it's not what you've done. It's what you should have done. You mean, if Hopalong would have just shot him the first chance he got, none of this would've ever happened. That's right. But Hoppy didn't believe in killing unless it was absolutely necessary. And now it started to look like he didn't have any choice. Better break up. Cover more ground that way. If you find Shango, hold him tight. He's as cunning as Satan himself. He'll slither right out of your hands. I'll tie him in a knot he can't get out of. Well, shoot a hole in the sky and we'll all meet up again. - Sounds good to me. - All right, take care of yourselves. ( clicks tongue ) Yah! Hah! ( cattle mooing ) Whoa. That looks like a stray down there, Thunder. Let's take a closer look. ( stray moos ) They sure did a good job of covering it up. - Drop 'em! - ( Thunder neighs ) Untie that steer. Stealing cattle's serious business. You'll find your neck at the end of a rope for it. Well, you're an old pro at it, Shango. ( laughs ) Darn, you recognized me. Hope you know how to run, Hopalong. ( laughs ) ( wind whistling ) ( water dripping ) ( bats squeaking ) Remember me? Well, sure, Tex. You're the babe with a gun. You should have killed me, Mr. Cassidy. Where's Mary? Alive and well. When I'm through with you, I'm gonna make her my wife. ( laughs ) Tex, she'd die first. Don't be so sure, Hopalong. Well, it's time for a little necktie party. We've got some cattle to sell. Oh, and by the way... ( chuckles ) in case you're wondering, there's a very deep pit under those boards. ( floorboards creaking ) Thanks for telling me, Tex. I'll try to be careful. I'm disappointed in you, Tex. You're more of a coward than I thought you were. You don't deserve to wear those gloves. I'm a better man than you, Cassidy, and you know it. Then why don't you fight me man-to-man? Unless big, bad Tex is a little old chicken. - ( man snickers ) - Tex: Untie him. Let's just hang him and get it over with. I said untie him. Man-to-man, huh? Choose your weapon. I'll give you the honor, Tex. ( chuckles ) Okay. Here's yours. And this will be mine. ( men jeering, laughing ) Men: Watch it. Watch it. Oh! Men: Shoot him. Shoot him. I'm gonna kill you now, Tex. I don't think so. ( men laughing ) Man: That was fun. He's out cold. No fun in hanging him now. We're not gonna hang him, Shango. Tie him up really good. I'm gonna blow him up. Give me his guns. Hopalong Cassidy will be buried forever. Tex Ewalt, the greatest gunfighter alive. ( laughing ) ( fuse fizzling ) Who deserves to wear the gloves now, Hopalong? ( faint splash ) ( splashes ) ( whistles ) ( birds crowing ) ( fizzling ) ( explosion rumbles ) ( horses neighing ) ( chuckles ) Amen. ( water gurgling ) ( horses neigh ) Whoa. There's footprints. Keep it down. Might be that rascal Shango. Red, would you put that there mean-looking thing away? I'm a-tremblin' from fright. You should be trembling. I thought you were Shango. You all right? Yeah, I will be. What are you doing here, Waffles? Hell, Hopalong, did you think I was gonna let you lick them rustlers all by yourself? - I hired some new hands to help. - Howdy, boys. There's a meadow over them hills and it's filled with cattle. Tex Ewalt took Mary, killed Jimmy, Shorty, and Pete. Tex Ewalt messed with the Bar 20. Now he's gonna pay. Come on, Thunder. ( clicks tongue ) ( Thunder neighs ) ( cattle mooing ) ( rooster crowing ) ( sheep bleating ) Howdy, Tex. Should have them cows sold in no time. You done good. Should make you a rich man. Not to mention the amount of money I'm gonna make from all this. ( laughing ) Shango. Too late, Shango. ( man panting ) ( gunfire ) ( man grunts ) - ( grunts ) - ( horse neighs ) ( gasps ) ( grunts ) ( yelps ) Told you I was gonna cut you up, bitch. ( horse neighs ) Hopalong! ( gagging ) Red: Can't find Tex nowhere. I'm going after him. Let him go. Won't make no difference killing him. Do you care for that man? No. I just want you to stay with me. What took you so long? Let's go home. ( screams ) Hopalong! Hopalong! Hopalong! ( screaming continues ) ( cattle mooing ) Thank God. Mary's back safe and sound. - Red: It's good to be home. - Lanky: Boy, it sure is. Uncle Buck! - ( Buck chuckles ) - They didn't get you. No, little Mary. I pulled through. Thank you. Hey, Red, did you bring me back an ear? Plumb forgot, Johnny. Brought you a whole string of tails, though. Don't just stand there, Cookie. Whip up some grub. Get some good food down my gullet. I'll have her sizzling in no time. I want to make sure you boys get rested up, 'cause you made it back just in time for the rodeo. Don't worry. We'll be ready tomorrow. We gotta win for Jimmy, Pete and Shorty. That's the way to talk. Buck: Come on in, all of you, every one of you. Let's make yourselves at home here. Come on. ( rooster crowing ) Come on, we'd better get a move on if we want to get to the rodeo on time. ( rings ) Ladies and gentlemen! - And you too, folks. - ( laughter ) Thank you for coming to this here rodeo! ( cheering, applause ) Hah! Whoo! Hah! It promises to be one of the most exciting exhibitions we've ever seen around here. I mean, you're gonna witness-- you're gonna witness extraordinary feats of physical prowess by men who helped make this great land what it is today! I'm talking about the men from the Circle Diamond Ranch... ( crowd cheering ) - and the C80... - ( crowd cheering ) - and the Flying W... - ( cheering ) - and the Rockin' H! - ( cheering ) And last, but not least, the great Bar 20! ( crowd cheering ) Yeah! Well, I reckon that's enough introduction. - You're here to see those boys go to it, right? - Crowd: Yeah! - Am I right? - Yeah! Hell, yes! Then let the games begin and may the best man win! ( crowd cheering ) Yah-hah-hah! Billy: Hah! Come on! Hah! Come on! Hah! Hah! Hah! Giddyup! Hah! Whoo! Come on. Yeah! Billy: Come on, come on, come on, come on. There you go. Come on. Attaboy. Yeah! Hah! Come on. Come on. Whoo! Announcer: Yes, sir! Billy Floyd of the Bar 20 wins first! ( crowd cheering ) Announcer: These boys have to ride the meanest, the toughest, the orneriest horses that ever walked this planet. ( crowd cheering ) Now, folks, the next contest is steer roping. ( cattle mooing ) Whoo! Come on, Lanky! Whoo! Yeah! Announcer: The winner-- Lanky Smith of the Bar 20! Way to go, Lanky. He sure can throw that rope like the devil. Sure can. Announcer: Now rifle shooting. ( gunshot ) Announcer: Real good shooting-- one in the bullseye, one just above. I can shoot better than that. Don't count on it. ( gunshot ) Announcer: One bullseye. ( gunshot ) Announcer: Two bullseyes. Eagle eye Red Connors of the Bar 20 is the winner! - ( cheering, applause ) - ( laughs ) By God, you're a regular Robin Hood. - Good shooting, Red. - Yeah. Folks, you're all in for a real treat here. This man's pistols have a life of their own. He's a magician with those damn Colts of his. I'm talking about the great Hopalong Cassidy! ( cheering, applause ) Man: Hopalong! Announcer: Folks, folks. Now, folks-- now, folks, because of the fame of this here man and his pistols, there ain't nobody around here with guts enough to compete with him. - ( crowd booing ) - But maybe, just maybe, he'll show us a little of that magic I was talking about anyways. How about it, Hoppy, huh? Show us your stuff, Hopalong. Attaboy, son. Eh, why not? Yay! ( laughs ) He's gonna do it. Thataway, Hoppy, thataway. ( applause ) ( gunshot echoes ) ( Red cocks gun ) Hold it. I'll show you a master gunfighter. You'd better if you want to wear those gloves. Put your rifles down. Let the contest go on. ( applause ) ( people murmuring ) ( two gunshots ) ( cheering, applause ) ( three gunshots ) ( three gunshots ) ( cheering, applause ) ( clanging ) Those gloves don't belong on your hands, Tex. Why don't you just come and get 'em? ( faint thunder rumbles ) You ought to stop 'em, Red. ( grunts ) ( thunder rumbles ) You've waited long, Mary, but you won't have to wait again. Stranger: And that's where the trail ends, son. That's a real good one, mister. Best I've heard in a long time. But what happened next? What-- what about Hopalong and Mary? Oh, that's another story for another time. Looks like a pretty morning. ( strums ) ( distant bell ringing ) ♪ Hopalong ♪ Where have you gone? ( horse whinnies ) Hey. You forgot your gloves.
