(tense contemplative music) - [Narrator] For 100 years, we've been the guinea pigs in a grand experiment. Can managers, experts and bureaucrats more efficiently plan and run our lives than we can? Does society flourish when a select few determine the path for the many? Experts are critical to evaluating, judging, and planning, but shouldn't we be in charge of our own lives? (static hisses) - [Announcer] Let's start with you and what you want. (soft bright music) What does anybody want? Millions have worshiped the strong man. Millions let somebody else decide what they want by fear, by force. (speaks in foreign language) (crowd yells) Yeah, a dictator. Over here, we don't like dictators. Our government represents us, the people. Our government is our servant, not our master, and it makes a lot of difference to you what you can do and what you can't do. Limitations of our rights? Sure. But for the public good, and that's the way our country has gone ahead. (static hisses) (contemplative music) - It was the year of science, turn of the century. Every day, new ideas came out. Society was changing much more rapidly than it ever had before. An important figure was Speedy, Frederick Winslow Taylor. Speedy was his nickname, and Speedy was the great efficiency expert who helped us to get the assembly line. - Industry was this enormous thing that erupted during that time, and apparently, Taylor could improve productivity. (flames rumble) (muffled speaking) - He would observe industrial processes, and he would figure out how to make them more efficient. - [Narrator] The guy was obsessed with scientific precision. His own peers called him authoritarian because he brought that obsession with precision into everything he did. He believed everything, especially factory work, could be perfected through science. - [Amity] One of the places Frederick Taylor worked was at Bethlehem Steel, where they were trying to get more productivity out of a worker. - [Narrator] And as providence would have it, the Spanish-American War sparked a surge in demand for American steel. Large demand for steel means Bethlehem Steel Company must move product, 80,000 tons off the train cars and into the yard. In fact, they were struggling in comparison to other steel plants. The workers were already the lowest paid and likely a third as efficient. With a desperate need to improve Bethlehem Steel and a theory that could change everything, this was Frederick's time to strike. - Frederick Winslow Taylor was the founder of scientific management. Why don't we figure out what's the one best way, the one best sequence of actions to get this, that, or the other task done in this large factory? - Taylor believed that we could all do things better, and that's fine, and factories could be more productive. Definitely true. But he also believed that people need to be categorized. He actually said, "Some people are stupid. They're like oxen. They need to work an ox's job. Other people are bright. They need their college men. They need to study the oxen and help the oxen and order the ox around." - So that was the principle of Taylorism is top down. "Science is what makes me a legitimate authority, and you who don't have science must be totally disempowered. You're just cluttering the system." - [Narrator] It was Frederick's theory of scientific management that made this possible. Take any job and reduce it to its simplest, most efficient tasks, steps, and motions, and motivate the right person to work as efficiently as possible. Most of these men collapsed from working too hard and refused to complete Taylor's first experiments in efficiency. Taylor later found one in particular who could outperform the rest. A Pennsylvania Dutchman Frederick had nicknamed Schmidt was all he needed to prove his theory. Frederick had Schmidt hustling up and down wooden planks to achieve his goal, and in a single day, Schmidt achieved what took the average worker an entire week's work. Taylor took backbreaking work and made it extremely profitable for his career. Taylor's cult of scientific efficiency was born. - [Amity] Taylorism was enormously popular because the early progressives were after progress. - [Narrator] Harvard, Penn State, Cornell, Purdue all converted his lectures into the world's first MBA programs where influential intellectuals were eager to impose an ideology that, not only can every corner of society be planned and controlled from the top down, but that it must be. - The progressives really took this question of national efficiency, and they took Taylor's ideas and they saw applications of those ideas well beyond the plant. Taylor himself says, "We can apply this not just to industrial management, but we can apply it to religion. We can apply it to private philanthropies. We can apply it to the farms." It was an economic idea, but then there were people during The Progressive Era in the early 20th century who said, "This is an idea really that applies across a whole range of things, including politics." - The progressives were one of the first intellectual movements that viewed society as a big company, let's say, or just a big organization that needs to be managed. - Taylorism then became the idea that the expert can come along, tell the non-expert how to do it, whatever it might be. - It essentially believed that if you had enough science and enough power, you could fix the human condition. (dark brooding music) - I think Taylor's ideas led directly to the enshrinement of expert government, the idea that experts should be involved in making all of the decisions. - [Narrator] Everything we do suddenly requires more scientific management. Personal hygiene, diet, child rearing, housing, posture, recreation, family structure. - And I think the 20th century took that model into its politics. - [Narrator] Government control. - The idea is that that we human beings are there to be controlled, and there is a scientific way for us to be, and then they use this information when making their directives to us. They issue their commands based upon what they've learned. That's the big mistake. That's the category mistake. A country is not a company. - [Narrator] And we would continue to read what the world's first management expert sowed. Within a few decades of Frederick's experiments, the consent of the government was about to be delegated to the experts. Revolution had ripped through Russia, and Vladimir Lenin had a worm in his stomach for more, but food and power were scarce, and things were only getting worse. Having lost many skilled workers during the Revolution, he needed a system that could turn malnourished peasants into red-blooded factory workers. Lenin's solution was a managerial economy. - It must have dawned on him how congenial that was to that entire structure that he had erected of political power. The Communist party is the ultimate Taylorist organization. If you ever saw how things worked in the Soviet Union, to the bitter end, it was this little group of people take over, and they, through science and expertise and technology, dominate everybody else. - [Narrator] When Stalin took Lenin's seat of power, the Soviet Russia represented the ultimate expression of Frederick Taylor's idea, a complete scientifically managed state. The promise of scientifically precise order and efficiency excited them, but they weren't the only ones. - American progressives weren't getting very far when it came to politics in the 1920s. Nobody was paying attention to them, and they wanted to be admired, and over in the Soviet Union, larger scale experiments were going on, and at one point, Soviet leaders invited American progressives, particularly people in the union movement, to come over and admire the Soviet Union for a fancy junket trip. - [Narrator] Basically a glorified field trip to admire the Soviet Union's achievements up close and personal. - In 1927, a group of progressives went to Russia. They went over on a boat called the Roosevelt, named after Theodore Roosevelt. - [Narrator] Stalin's guest list included an assortment of journalists, intellectuals, and labor leaders. Among them were two fanboys of Taylor's writings, Rexford Tugwell, an economist who saw a great need to reform American agriculture, which he believed was too inefficient and wasteful, and Stuart Chase, a social theorist who believed that engineers should be in charge of government and run society like a machine. Both saw much potential in the centralized economy of the Soviet experiment, and the timing of their visit couldn't have been better. But even with a generous audience, Soviet leaders still had a lot to hide. - You're not getting recognition at home. You think you deserve recognition. You go over to Russia and they unroll the red carpet. (dramatic music with Russian vocals) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] What they didn't know was that Stalin meticulously planned every detail of their tour, the factories, the farms, all carefully staged for them like a perfectly scripted Disney ride. They saw a lot of Russia but only the Russia that Stalin wanted them to see. - Russia put on a good show for these Americans to impress them. They built a modern Potemkin village, a fake Russia to show the travelers. They showed them only the good parts. They sat them down with pretty girls. They made sure they had a good time, and they hid the bad parts, the Soviet government and the Soviet trade unions, from these visitors. - Of course, what they're never shown are the gulags and the execution chambers and the torture chambers and all these things, and only educated Western intellectuals could be stupid enough to believe the kind of Kabuki theater that they were being presented, either by Stalin's Russia or anyone else. - They were thinking about work and labor productivity and the American worker and the Soviet worker, but Stalin, he was talking past them. He was really grandstanding 'cause then he could say an interview with the United States, and he needed what? Western currency. Russia was actually desperate because the Soviet experiment was actually already failing. It needed America and it needed American recognition. - [Narrator] And if you impress these intellectuals and labor leaders, you'll legitimize the Soviet Union and create diplomatic ties. By the end, the junket left Russia ironically on a ship called Leviathan, stuffed to the brim with hopes of spreading the dream of a reimagined, fully managed, centrally planned United States. - There was always a kind of fascination with Marxism and Marxism, Leninism among American intellectual leftists, and so a certain predisposition to believe that America could learn from Soviet Russia, that the Soviet experiment was working. - They all left with one big impression. "I can have more authority. I can have more power 'cause the Russians do. Look, they run the economy. I could do it, too." Americans were all interested in the Soviet experiment. I've seen the future and it works. - [Narrator] Journalists at The "New York Times," "The New Republic," and other news sources were breathlessly favorable. These voices of the media were what the Americans trusted, both working class and political elites alike. Walter Duranty, The "New York Times" Russia correspondent, was especially helpful in pushing a utopian narrative about the Soviet Union. - Walter Duranty, who later emerged when you read the copy, is an apologist for Soviet abuse, for murder, who helped to cover up the evil that was happening in the Soviet Union. - [Narrator] It turns out, after winning a Pulitzer that much of what he reported about the Soviet Union was, quote, "some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper." Those are their words, not mine. By the time the truth of what was happening in the Soviet Union finally began to surface in the '30s, the misinformation and propaganda had already taken root in many people's minds. Duranty's influence was cemented as soon as he won the Pulitzer Prize. Nevermind the cover ups over mass starvation. He had the ear of the people and of elites like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and when FDR won the presidency a few years later, he'd bring along two gentlemen who saw the Russian experiment firsthand. They became a part of FDR's group of advisors, the Brain Trust, and the Brain Trust had some new ideas for how to cure The Great Depression. - [Announcer] And here it is, the beginning of the greatest drama in American affairs, the creation of a new chief executive. Roosevelt is the nation's idol here today. Thousands of Americans are here to cheer the birth of a new era in national affairs, a New Deal era, which is supposed to pull the country out of its chaos. - I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that have stricken the nation in the midst of a stricken world may require fraud, executive power to wage a war against the emergency. This nation is asking for action and action now! (audience applauds) (tense music) (triumphant marching music) (flames crackle) (slow dramatic music) - [Joseph] The circumstances under which Franklin Roosevelt enters office in 1933, the country's really in a chaotic state. The stock market crash happens in 1929. It's been going on now for several years. - [Amity] Unemployment was over 20%. We had a national emergency. People actually were starving. - [Joseph] The Great Depression really put so many people in America on the edge of subsistence, and so this created a situation where people were willing to turn to whatever solutions they thought might work. They were desperate for government to do something. - The Great Depression and the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 presented progressives with a priceless opportunity to put into practice their optimistic hopes for the power of government to solve social and economic problems. The Harding and Coolidge administrations dismantled much of the machinery of government that had built up particularly during the First World War, and Roosevelt was certain that if he had the opportunity, he would rebuild it in a way that it couldn't be torn down. ♪ All the world on the way to the ♪ - [Narrator] And Roosevelt pledged to strike a New Deal for the American worker. In other words, "I know you're suffering, and I have a plan that will fix it. Trust me." The predominant view in the Brain Trust was that the market was too unstable, too inefficient, and wasteful. This depression could only be tamed by expert bureaucrats. - These were people basically in the Roosevelt administration who weren't necessarily politicians. They were experts. Roosevelt really embraces the idea of expert government that his Brain Trust is starting to pitch to him as the future of American government. - [Steven] Franklin Roosevelt and the other New Dealers were enormously critical of the waste and inefficiency of free market capitalism. - Now we have an industrial economy with advanced things like railroads and telephone. So the world's changed. So we need to direct things from Washington. That was the mindset that Roosevelt and his Brain Trust had. They were smarter than the rest of us. - Franklin Roosevelt had tremendous faith in experimentation as a means of solving social problems. (contemplative music) And he says in one of his speeches, "We should try something. Just try it, and if it doesn't work, try something else, but above all, try something." (muffled shouting) - If we would keep faith, if we would make democracy succeed, I say we must act now! - [Narrator] Roosevelt's government descended on the country in militaristic fashion, waging more on this economic beast and claiming all the executive power that comes with it, creating a bunch of new agencies through a compliant Congress. - And it's really those first couple of years of Roosevelt's presidency where the most audacious and wide-ranging centralized planning efforts were attempted. - The centerpiece of the New Deal was an administration, the National Recovery Administration, that regulated business across the board, including in very confusing ways, such as how many chickens a chicken seller could sell, what price something might be. - [Narrator] Hundreds of new laws regulating every little detail you can think of, the precise components of macaroni, the price a tailor could charge for sewing a button. Consumers can no longer pick their own chickens. And the point of all of this was to bring the runaway economy under rational expert control. - This was basically a mandate to the president, the ability to restructure competition across the entire country. - [Narrator] And on the heels of the NRA came the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the AAA. More regulation. The Brain Trust believed that government expertise, not the free market, could dictate the economy by artificially controlling prices. - The idea of scientific management is clearly what leads to the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and the basic notion is we need to make sure that the farms aren't producing too much food because once that happens, the prices of all of the commodities will go down, and that will put the farmers out of business. - [Narrator] The AAA turned over any surplus of food to the government. So now with millions of starving Americans and a government that owns a surplus of commodities that could solve that problem, what did they do? They destroyed it. Dairies dumped milk into the sewers. Train loads of oranges were soaked in kerosene. Businesses shuttered, and people continued to starve because Roosevelt's inner circle of experts knew what was best. - [Joseph] We need to plan agricultural production so that the farmers produce less food so that their prices can say high so that they can stay in business. - Suddenly, businesses were saying, "This New Deal does not work out for us. There are too many rules. They're meant to help my business, but actually, they hurt my business and keep recovery far away from me." (soft ethereal music) - And the New Deal really is the full emergence of this idea of centralized planning by administrative experts, and I think the American people were ready to take that direction from the government because they were afraid for what was happening in terms of their own families and their own futures. All of Roosevelt's policies really didn't do much to end The Great Depression. The Depression continued for many years. - That is why I am asking the worker of America to go along with us in a spirit of understanding and of helpfulness. - [Narrator] Despite the Trust's best thinking, planning, and experimenting, the Depression was refusing to disappear. The New Deal tested the limits of executive authority, and the Brain Trust proved that any government, given the right crisis, can transform a country completely, sometimes for good and sometimes for the worst. (triumphant music) It was 1934. One in five American workers were unemployed. The experts who staffed President Roosevelt's new National Recovery Administration believed they could end The Great Depression by writing strict new regulations for the market. - Franklin Roosevelt and the other New Dealers believed that they could solve the problems of those industries and therefore solve the problems of American economic life through the application of technical and scientific expertise within the government. - Nobody knew what the New Deal would be, but what it did prove pretty fast to be was a threat to small business, particularly the National Recovery Administration, which had a lot of codes that made it hard for business to operate. - [Narrator] But Americans quickly soured on the National Recovery Administration's overbearing and ineffective bureaucracy. - And the way it all came to a head was through a chicken business, chicken butchers in Brooklyn called the Schechters. - [Narrator] The Schechter brothers were Jewish immigrants who ran a kosher chicken business. Unlike the economists at the National Recovery Administration, the Schechters were uneducated working class men, but they knew the poultry business. Their last name Schechter was an occupational surname derived from the Hebrew word for slaughter. - So these Schechters, it was in their culture for their customers, restaurants, or sometimes individuals, to pick their chickens. You wanted to be able to pick which chicken you were buying 'cause you wanted a healthy, not a tubercular, chicken. It was the culture of the marketplace that they came from. They were religious Jews. They sold kosher chickens. It was very important for their customers to have chicken choice. - [Narrator] But according to the National Recovery Administration, customers weren't supposed to choose their own chickens. NRA inspectors wrote up the Schechters on 60 code violations, including some criminal charges. In addition, the Schechters allegedly violated NRA codes that set worker hours pay, and chicken prices. - New Deal comes along and says, "You're breaking the law. We're gonna charge you. You might go to jail." (slow dramatic music) They find themselves on the stand, count after count against them, being prosecuted by the government for violating New Deal law. And in the arguments by the attorneys, what you can feel is the arrogance of the expertise. The lawyers who were prosecuting the little chicken dealers really explicitly berated them. They said, "How dare you presume to tell me what a chicken's price must be? Only experts can say that. If you had studied agricultural economics, you would be an expert, but you're not an economist. You're just a little chicken dealer." So you see that clash so clearly in this case, the expert book learning versus the expert, the common man. - [Narrator] The case of Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States went all the way to the Supreme Court. On May 27th, 1935, the Supreme Court handed down its decision, a unanimous victory for the Schechter brothers. - Sometimes it's referred to as Black Monday, the day that the Supreme Court said that the New Deal and major components of it were unconstitutional. - [Narrator] The National Recovery Administration was dead. It should have proved to the Roosevelt administration that their experts couldn't regulate the economy back to health, but FDR didn't give up on managerialism, and eventually, the Supreme Court upheld many other programs of the New Deal, programs that may have actually extended The Great Depression. - Louis Brandeis, one of the people who brought the ideas of scientific management into the public square, was now on the Supreme Court, and he was part of that Supreme Court that handed down these decisions saying that the New Deal was unconstitutional. - [Narrator] Years earlier, Brandeis helped make the father of managerialism, Frederick Winslow Taylor, a household name. Brandeis was the one who told Taylor in 1909 to call his system scientific management, but now, Brandeis was saying that FDR had crossed a line. - It's a peculiar historical fact, right? That people credit FDR with rescuing Americans from The Great Depression. Anyone who knows any history at all knows that we were still in a deeply depressed state in the late 1930s. The evidence is overwhelmingly clear that he didn't save Americans from The Great Depression. He extended the length of the Depression. - [Narrator] Meanwhile, what happened to the Schechter brothers? The government's persecution cost them everything. The Schechters spent every nickel they had on their case. Their poultry business, which was doing $20,000 of business every week before the New Deal, went down to $2,000 a week and then went out of business. On the year anniversary of the Schechter Supreme Court victory, The "New York Times" reported that the entire Schechter family was virtually penniless. The Schechter case was a momentary defeat for managerialism, but there were still plenty of experts in the government that were certain they could regulate their way to a more perfect America. - What is an expert? Is it someone with practical experience in a certain field, or is it someone with book learning? The man with experience, the regular person, was insufficiently respected by the New Deal, and we can experiment with people because we're clever. We're professors and they need us. There's an emergency. The patient is dying on the table, the U.S. economy. Let's operate on his heart because we are surgeons who know better than everyone else. - [Narrator] After World War II, a new president would launch his own expansion of expert rule which he called the Fair Deal. Expert economic planning had taken a major hit in the Schechter case, but what about expert housing planning? (soft ethereal music) (audience cheers) The purview of expert administration grew bit by bit. It all started with Woodrow Wilson's supposedly modest effort to offload the minute details of government administration, from Congress to disinterested and efficient experts until FDR's New Deal. Now a public that had endured a Great Depression and a Second World War was growing accustomed to centralized federal power. Six years of war dramatically transformed the U.S. economy and many of its cities. This brought waves of migration into cities, and that unsurprisingly brought its own housing challenges. So how does the federal government solve a problem like housing? Simple, by throwing money and expertise at it. President Truman took a page from FDR's book and unveiled a Fair Deal agenda, which included the Housing Act of 1949. The FHA poured money into urban renewal and slum clearance projects. The government's experts believed that slums could be replaced with highly efficient, self-sustaining public housing. - The beginning of the Great Society was urban renewal, building tall towers to house people on the principle We knew how to house people. - [Narrator] Perhaps no project was more ambitious than St. Louis's Pruitt-Igoe Complex. A massive stretch of downtown was completely razed to make room for it, entire neighborhoods erased. Up and coming architect Minoru Yamasaki was selected to design the buildings. Yamasaki was highly influenced by a French architect named Corbusier. Corbusier was a huge fan of Frederick Winslow Taylor, and Taylor's principles of efficiency imbued his work. Yamasaki wanted to try something similar for Pruitt-Igoe. Architecture magazines raved about his initial designs. Skip stop elevators stopped on every third floor. The idea was both to maximize the number of units and to foster a sense of community by encouraging interaction between neighbors, and although he preferred a mix of building sizes rather than strictly high rises, St. Louis officials said no. - [Amity] He had to work for government, and government said, "Well, this is too expensive. You have to make this housing more dense." - [Narrator] Reluctantly, Yamasaki did it their way, and up the towers went. - 33 Towers, 11 stories each, and the premise was people live in slums. Let's move them into something nice, an animal farm in the city, right? Pruitt-Igoe. These towers are clean. They have all sorts of amenities that the homes these people live in don't have. They're gonna be happier, and progress will ensue. - So we'll take these people, raze all these private homes, create the modern towers. Just the fact that they're in this modern gleaming place is going to engender feelings in the residents (lawnmower hums) that are gonna lead to utopia. Well, what happens is the exact opposite. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] It's hard to find the right word for what happened next, tragedy, disaster. St. Louis officials assumed the city's population would keep growing. It did not. The same FHA money that allowed for the construction of the complex also subsidized suburban home ownership. Whites left the city in droves, making the complex de facto segregated. (film reel clicks) (tense music) There weren't enough people willing to live in the towers, which again were designed to have maximum occupancy so that the collected rent would cover upkeep. Many of the residents received government benefits, so they paid a much lower rate. Under Missouri law, welfare benefits came with a brutal requirement. A family could only have one parent, a mother. The government was paying mothers to kick fathers out of their homes, disproportionately wrecking black families. Upkeep quickly unraveled as there wasn't enough money generated to pay for it. But Yamasaki's designs bear some blame as well. - Because people couldn't get off on their floor through the elevator, they had to go on the stairs, and muggers came and mugged them there. No one wants to go up and down stairs 'cause that's where the muggers go. It was true, and Pruitt-Igoe became very dangerous. - [Narrator] Light fixtures in the breezeways were constantly being smashed, leaving nightmarishly dark holes where the worst of things could and did happen. - This glorious national symbol of a public housing project, instead of becoming heaven, became hell and was eventually dynamited in a very sad and dramatic session. So instead of building the future American home, we put people in prisons. That's what Pruitt-Igoe was. It was universally hated by a proud city, St. Louis. It's still a scar on the cityscape. - The people had no voice on it. Science as interpreted by the politicians in the 20th century took on an arrogant edge to it, and, of course, that meant the rule of the experts, the rule of the scientists. (slow dramatic music) We don't know enough. We know a lot, but we don't know enough. - [Narrator] Nobody took the failure more to heart than the architect Yamasaki. He expressed regret for his deplorable mistakes with Pruitt-Igoe. By the 1950s, he was giving bitter speeches about the tragedy of housing thousands in exactly lookalike cells, which certainly does not foster our ideals of human dignity and individualism. To the Detroit Free Press, he put it more simply. "Social ills can't be cured by nice buildings." The final towers were demolished on spectacular display in 1976. With them should have gone the hubris of centrally planned government, but alas. What did government do instead? We launched the Great Society, the next New Deal. Early progressives were interested in efficiency, in making government more efficient through expert administration. They hated wastefulness. Their solution was to run society like an engineer. To them, political science could replace politics. The New Deal was just applying that principle. Centralize as much power over the economy, over housing, over business as possible. The Supreme Court may have reined FDR's program in, but the administrative state he helped construct continued to grow in size and scope anyhow. When Lyndon Johnson announces his Great Society initiative, the goal of this administrative state is no longer just about expert control over the economy. It's far deeper. - So Lyndon Johnson's Great Society was an attempt on the one hand to harness New Deal, progressive-style government, faith in expertise, the attempt to ameliorate the problems of modern capitalist industrialist society. We're not just going to throw money at the poor and say, "Okay, we've provided a safety net. We're going to end poverty." And you think about how radical that really is. We're gonna transform the human condition. - And this administration today here and now declares unconditional war on poverty in America. - Poverty has been with human beings since human beings began to exist, and we're gonna fix that. We, in our time in 1960s America, have the wealth and the resources and the expertise to transform the human condition, to permanently end the problem of poverty. We have the ability in this time, not just to solve man's material needs, but also to solve man's cultural and spiritual longings. We are going to fulfill the longings of the soul through expert government programs. We're going to bring the city of God down to earth. - [Narrator] Utopia was within reach. All that was required was enough managerial power in the hands of the right people. - So we get food stamps as a new entitlement. We get the expansion of Social Security to include Medicare and Medicaid. We get increased housing assistance. - [Narrator] Urban renewal efforts like Pruitt-Igoe were a flat-out disaster that left cities in worse shape than they'd seen before. Even the more successful programs fell wildly short of Johnson's goals. Shortly after health entitlements were introduced, it became clear that there were crucial gaps in coverage. High prices to taxpayers and losses through bureaucratic inefficiency and fraud quickly bred increased government dependence with an ever increasing burden on taxpayers, which caused backlash by a disillusioned public, but the damage was done. - By the latter half of the 20th century, all the intellectual foundations for, and the framework of, the justification for the administrative state had been put in place, and it had, for better or worse, been widely accepted by the general public and by the political class. - [Narrator] But that was not the original pitch for the American republic. At least FDR pressured a compliant Congress into signing legislation for his ambitious programs. With the Great Society and greater expansion of government power over our lives, this whole three branches of government thing was getting tossed right out the door. - Republics are based on the idea that we elect people who make the laws, but most of the laws today aren't made by Congress. Most of the laws today are made by administrative agencies. (muffled speaking) The rules and regulations that are made by the national government are made in EPA, at FDA, at the FTC, at the SEC, and all of the alphabet soup agencies that we know are the real governing institutions in America today. (soft ethereal music) (camera shutter clicks) - [Narrator] Woodrow Wilson opened a fourth branch of government, expert administrators who would deal with all the little details of regulation that Congress neither had the time nor the expertise to handle themselves. But this fourth branch was overtaking the other three. - It now exercises all three powers of the other branches, which is a big no no under the idea of separation of powers, which is a key component of our constitutional system. - The promises that Lyndon Johnson made about what government could do for them were unbelievable and, in the end, unattainable and have fueled the perception that government makes promises that it can't keep that, that we should be cynical about government because government is a disaster, government can't do the things that it's supposed to do. It makes promises and doesn't keep them. - [Martin] What happened in the 21st century is a sudden realization by the public that they were in somewhat of a parallel position to the worker in the factory floor. Don't think, right? Because the experts know. - [Narrator] The experts know more than you do about what's good for your personal nutrition. They know better than you do about how to keep us all safe. They know better than you about your finances. They know how to protect the environment. They know how to protect your health. - [Don] What the COVID episode showed is that a free people can indeed be made so scared that they are willing, in fact eager, to give up their freedoms. - The COVID pandemic really highlighted the ability of scientific experts to abuse their powers. - [Martin] The government thought it knew more than it did and then demonstrated it knew less than it thought, okay? - The idea that government in an emergency should respond rapidly to deal with a crisis, that's always been part of American government, but what's new is the authority of the science and the authority of the scientists to command our allegiance. All of our decisions were going to be based on a model produced by experts inside the government who could predict with much more accuracy than they actually can what would happen if you just follow their orders. - When COVID came along, Anthony Fauci first said this, and then he said the opposite, and CDC stood in the way of developing a vaccine, and there were all these moments where the people in charge seemed to be more the problem than the solution. - It soon came to be taken by the general public and by the political elite that they were the experts, and any questioning of that was to deny science. - We should always remember Richard Feynman's wonderful definition of science. "Science is the belief that the experts are wrong." Science is about contestation, not orthodoxy. - The lesson that I draw from the effects of the administrative state is that it's a bad deal. - America's in the midst of a really central moment in its history where, on both sides of the political spectrum, there's an increasing distrust of the people in power. I think we do need to rethink the foundations of modern administration. We need to restore some idea of an administration that is in our control. - We need experts. We need expertise. The issue is, will experts have power? Value expertise but fear expert power. - [Steven] We actually have to have the power to say yes to this expert, no to this other expert. - If we want a true rule of experts, in my view, it would be to decentralize decision making as much as possible. No one is more expert in what is good for me than me, and I have an incentive to get it right. Don Boudreaux is the world's leading expert on Don Boudreaux. - [Narrator] For 100 years, we've been the guinea pigs in a grand experiment.
