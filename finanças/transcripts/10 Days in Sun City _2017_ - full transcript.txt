Death is death. No matter how it comes. Kill me if you will. But do me a favor, send my corpse to Warri. Akpos! - Monika Lewinsky! - Look at my friend! - Monika Lewinsky! - Look at my friend! - Look at my friend! - What's up? Look at my friend! What's up? Your house is beautiful. - Take it. - Your father! Look at my friend! You've stylishly set yourself up. - What's up? - Leave me alone. Do you want to beat me? You guys do so well in Lagos. You do so well in Lagos. Look at this place. - Take it. - Your father! So you can't just tell your friend that you've gotten an endorsement. Hmm? I didn't know you were married. And you didn't tell us back home. When did you get married? Did you give me the husband? Monika, do you live in this house all by yourself? Hmm. It's grape, not sugarcane. Don't chew it recklessly. Quit asking dumb questions. Your girlfriend... is pretty. Of course. She's my everything. This is Bianca. Bianca. Bianca is going to become the next Queen of Nigeria. And I am her manager. With your carrot head. What do you have to say? - Bianca. - Hmm? - You are truly a very beautiful woman. - Thank you. I'll make sure you don't have any problems at all. - Akpos said you're very nice too. - Of course I am. I mean... can't you see? You know, Lagos is for very smart people. And I see smartness behind that beauty of yours. Like you, I came to Lagos three years ago with nothing. Absolutely nothing. Look at me today. You've done really well for yourself in three years. Mm-hmm. And if you stick with me, this will certainly be your story. Monika. Monika, Monika. Hey, guy. The name is now Monique. We won't be deceived with this re-branding in Lagos. You know how we came up with the name Lewinsky? Akpos, point of correction. I mean, a point of direction. - Okay. - My name is Monique, dude. No more Lewinsky. Let me tell my girlfriend about it. Bianca, you know how we came up with the name Lewinsky? We caught Monika inside an uncompleted building making out with our friend Igho. Making out? Put your tongue back in your mouth. Put your tongue back in your mouth. A cat that swims is not a catfish. You want me to show you the door? Okay, I'm sorry. Monique, we are here to register Bianca for the Queen of Nigeria pageant. - Really? - They sent us some information. I'm certain you will win. Here's their address. Can you take us there so we can register? Locate the address. I should take you there? Dude. You're always full of your empty self. You're always so full of yourself. Huh? There's something called a website these days and you can register on it. Please, come with me. - I came with someone. - She asked me to bring you in. Ah... Welcome, welcome. How are you? Please, where is Monique? Monique. Come and sit down. You are beautiful. You are beautiful. I should have believed her when she told me that you were stunning. You are an epitome of beauty. Sit down. Sit down. You see, I have... That's the way I like them: Young and pure. I'm coming. I'm coming. - Here. - Please, what's this for? Money. I don't want your money. See, let me tell you. People like me, have done the work that people like you should be doing. Come. Ah-ah! I like them young and restless. The way you're going about this thing... Exactly. Ah! That is the way I like it. The way you... That... Why are you running up and down? See, I don't have the energy of Terry G to be running up and down and up and down. Uh-huh. Just keep it simple. I'm Mr. Easy. See, come. Just let this thing revolve around your bum bum. Come. Come. See... Ah, hey! Man! See, my guy! Monika. - Monika! Monika! - Dude, dude, it's Monique! How many times do I have to tell you? Monika, your father. - Your father. - Repeat it. May God punish that Monique name. You can be a monkey for all I care. Are you insulting me? - May God punish you, Monique! - What? You think everyone is a prostitute like you? May God punish you. God, please punish this man's mouth. This senseless fool... I don't have the time to talk to any goat in yellow. Do you understand? I never knew. I work very hard to make my money. Is that why you've tried to prostitute my girlfriend? See this goat and his horns. Your girlfriend? Look at this idiot. Did you not say you're her manager? And what difference does it make? Please don't spit in my eye. I cannot be moved by your threats. Look how you open your nose like a hippo. Just look at this guy! Anyway, I don't have time to argue with you. Do you understand? Before I close my eyes and open them again, you and that senseless girl should leave my house. Wait a minute. Is this what you call a house? A place you got through prostitution. Huh? No problem. If the both of you don't leave here in two seconds, you will get whatever is coming to you. Wait. Is prostitution a job? Is this life? Whore. Prostitute. Promiscuous woman. - Shameless. - Look at you. You don't have a drop of shame. I've sold my shame during the Warri crisis. - I don't care what you think. - Take a look at your life. - Your father. - Your real father. Seyi! Who's that? Seyi, it's your guy Akpos, from Warri. Akpos... What? Akpos! Seyi, long story. I'll tell you everything, but please... - Man, life in Lagos is hard. - Of course, what do you expect? Anyway, as I was saying, I need some money desperately! Hmm. You need money? Uh, if you can hang on till next weekend, that's when I'm selling one of my kidneys to some Malaysian mafia guys. So from there, I can raise funds. - Seyi. - What is it? - Sell your kidney? - You need to wake up. This is Lagos, understand? It's the regular business we do here. Buying and selling. It's called the "spare parts" business. Body organs, kidney, liver, intestines. Do you think everyone you see on the street has complete organs? Even I have only one kidney remaining. And that's the one I'm selling next weekend. - Then I can gather some money for you. - God forbid. Wouldn't you rather bet with NairaBet on Arsenal versus Chelsea and win money? Kidney money is good money! Okay, I've heard you. Seyi, you will do me one favor. - What is it? - Okay. You see my delicate beauty over there? - Sweet girl. - Yes, exactly. But don't think about it. What's that supposed to mean? We all know you to be a rapist in College of Commerce back then. - What is wrong with you? No, no, no. - Bring your voice down. Okay, okay. Is it because I let you into my house, you believe you are allowed to insult me? And you're even threatening me too. - Shh. Bring your voice down. - Leave my house right now. I was only messing with you. You think you can just walk into my house anytime you desire, huh? Maybe I should just throw you guys out and allow the agbero to pounce on her. Then you'll know that you are better off with me alone. - Bring your voice down. - Leave my house right now. I was only messing with you. What is wrong with you? Relax. I'm saying if anything happens to her, you'll see my "red eye." Hmm. Look at his head. Anyways, she's only here for the night. She'll be heading for the beauty pageant camp before daybreak. I'll be timing you. I'm watching the time. You're lucky I'm now born again, or I would've taught you a lesson tonight. - Seyi, Seyi. - What is it? - One more question. - Hmm. When are you going to improve your English? That's your business... Okay, zoom in. Take a look, can you see the shape? We hear you are the stylists providing for stars like Genevieve, Rita Dominic and Omotola. Correct. We also heard some of them can't afford to buy clothes but for people like you. Yes. That's the more reason, I want you to style my girl. Bro, are you the one saying this? Eh? With your investment, she'll be going places, and that includes you as a stylist. Trust me, when she will be going around Africa, she will then be on CNN, BBC, and "Al Jazebra." And guess what? All other designers like Armani, Van Persie, Gucci, and Ronaldo, Louis Vuitton. They'll all envy you. - And who is that? - Oh, you don't even know your colleagues? Listen, bro, I'm a world-class designer. And I design for top-class celebrities like Agbani Darego. Listen to yourself, bro. Agbani Darego. That means, "Agbani's reign is over." The next queen in-line is Bianca Okamugba. You can check her out. She's such a beauty with untapped talent. My raw gold. Pepperlini, take a look at her. Bro, I see you're already checking her out. Um... I'll take the risk. - Bro, this is not Bobrisky I brought. - Oh, my goodness. Bro, do this for me and Warri will hear about it. I'll convince them to let us in. Don't you worry. Go on, try your luck. Good afternoon, sirs. We are part of this pageant. You see, Miss Delta... We're both official representatives for the pageant. - I'm the sponsor of Miss Delta. - I'm a representative. We forgot the invitations. Please let us in. I'm so sorry, sir. No invites, no entry. That's our instruction. Sir, I understand if you don't respect this man. But have some respect for me. If you are crowned Queen of Nigeria, what would you do to make better this particular challenge? Human trafficking and sex trafficking is modern-day slavery. Young girls are taken away from their homes, away from their families. And their lives are literally taken out of their hands. They are denied the opportunity to choose and define their own future. This serious issue is very, very close to my heart. And whether I am crowned queen tonight or not, I dedicate my time to empowering these young women and teaching them to be self-reliant in building their self confidence. And letting them... Tell this man who I am. Do you know where I am from? I'm not moved by the size of your chest. I'm not intimidated by your looks. Tell him who I am. Sir, just in case you wish to react, remember I'm not the one provoking you. How'd you feel if you spent money to sponsor a contestant, and you don't get to see the person win the crown? What kind of wickedness is that? Can't you talk? Are you a dummy? Let me explain. Life is not all about showing off your muscles, understand? You need to make use of your initiative. It's not right! It's not right! You're a wicked person and this is why some of you don't progress in life. The difference between you and Civil Defense is in the packaging. What are you guys still doing here? The event is almost over, and you're still standing here. You see! This is someone who knows me. Ask him. I'm the manager of Miss Delta. I'm the manager of Miss Delta. Guy, clear it up. You guys coming? You're a wicked person. A wicked person. You're lucky. Idiot. Ladies and gentlemen... it is now time to reveal the second and first runner-up. This is Annie Idibia. Our second runner-up is... Miss Akwa Ibom! Miss... Kano! You think she can win this pageant? Ladies and gentlemen... And the winner is? And the winner is... And the winner is? Miss Delta! Bianca has won! Bianca has won! Let's go! I'm going on the stage! Welcome to the house of Otawi. Please. So, how does it feel? Oh, please. How does it feel to be the Queen of Nigeria? Okay, so, here's what we're doing. Otawi Cosmetics, we are the giants of the cosmetic business in Nigeria and in Africa. We are already number one in Africa. But we want to dominate the world, and that's where you come in. - Okay. - You will be the face of Otawi Cosmetics. We've developed a new product. It will be the game-changer. The definition of the beautiful African woman will never be the same again. You will be going off to South Africa, 10 days in Sun City, shooting the commercial for the product. - Sun City! - Yes. I said it! Warri never comes last! I'm sorry. Please, can I talk to my manager? - Him? - Yes. Oh, yeah, please. Thank you. We should have been notified. We can't just get up and head to Sun City for 10 days, can we? What kind of notice do you want? Akpos, shouldn't we be notified beforehand? Listen, they're trying to make you become famous. So quit speaking like you're already famous. All you have to do is simply insist you want your manager to come with you. - Akpos, are you sure? - I'm with you all the way. Will anyone try to sleep with you under my nose? - Is everything all right? - Yes, sir. Um, I'd like to please take my manager with me. Your manager. What's your name? My name is Akpos Oboroghenerukokwo Umukoro Dafe. What? Akpos Oboroghenerukokwo Umukoro Dafe. The "A" is violent. All right, so I'll email you guys the itinerary for the week, and then tomorrow we have a lovely tour planned for you guys of the city. And then Monday, of course, we're shooting. My client is a "core" professional. All right, if you need to contact me, please feel free. My name is Kim K, director of operations at Otawi SA. Isn't she talking too fast? Maybe she's been sucking on lime. I've just told my girlfriend that you're gorgeous. - Yes. - You are pretty. Yeah. Ah, thank heavens. Anywhere I enter, it gets exciting. Warri. Warri. Warri... - All right, guys. - Your father! Clearly, nothing is impossible. The place is beautiful. - Are you enjoying this song? - Yeah. - We need Nigerian songs. - Akpos. - Why are they this biased? Wait. - Akpos, don't-- Relax! A Nigerian song is a Nigerian song. You know we now rule Africa in songs. Wait, relax. Trust me, I got this. I got this. Hey, how are you? How's it going? I am Akpos Oboroghenerukokwo Umukoro Dafe. Huh? I said my name is Akpos Oboroghenerukokwo Umukoro Dafe. Okay, hurry it up. Okay. Please, can you play some real music like Tekno's "Pana"? - Tekno. - Pana, Pana, Tekno, Pana. - Pana? - Pana, Pana, Pana. - Pana, Pana, Pana? - Yeah, yeah. - Eh... - What's that? It's a song. - Oh, techno! Techno! - Yeah, play Tekno. - But techno is boring. - What? - You need some Kwaito. Check it out. - What's that? Play Kwaito, patana, all that stuff. - What's patana? - You don't know patana? - And Kachamia? - Kachamia. - Ai, yeah! - No, wait! Leave Kwaito in Soweto. Tekno, Tekno. Tekno's "Pana" is P for "pipeline." - A for "area." - Area code. N for "Nigeria." That's where Tekno comes from. Another A for "egbe wager." Aha! You see it? One, two. One, two. Tekno, Tekno. Tekno, Tekno. Let me teach them. Do you guys know it? Are you all here? You left without letting me know, I was looking all over for you. What's wrong with you? My raw gold. Huh? Why are you so upset? My baby. The Queen of Nigeria! My queen-- Uh-uh. What's the problem? Uh-uh. Oh, oh, oh... Wait a minute, relax. Tell me what I did wrong. Is it because of the South African girl? Please don't let me down. You abandoned me. ♪ She's nothing compared to you ♪ ♪ And I'm in love with you ♪ ♪ That's what foreigners call too legit ♪ ♪ Too legit to quit, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Too legit ♪ Take a look at this tummy. Looks like what was designed by Tommy Hilfiger. This is what we need in the pageantry business. To be a pageant queen, you need to be on your game. See that queen over there, hmm? - That's my handiwork. Yeah. - Wow! She has drive, but I made her happen. I certainly can make you girls have a career. Beautiful. All right. And let's try over your left. Lovely. I'm the king when it comes to the making of a queen. Take a stroll with me, ladies. You see, this pageantry business is very, very important, you know. Pageantry is a unique focus on culture. And it's an expression of beauty. You must possess creativity, brains, and a good walk, as you swing left and right, left and right, left and right, left and right. Now everyone strike a pose. Strike a pose. Come on. Let me make a choice. Uh, Bianca, give us a relaxed-- Lift your arms. Yes, that's it. A day at the beach. Just... try and put everything at the back of your mind. And we're relaxed and... You! Step forward. Yay! He picked me! I'd just like to give you a small piece of advice, hmm? You need to start eating. You look hungry. Just like a factory-rejected chicken. Are you angry? It was only a joke! The girl is now angry. She has evicted herself anyway. Uh, Bianca, are you all right? You don't want to take a five-minute break, do you? - I'm okay. - Are you okay? Well, do me a favor. Take a deep breath. And then give us that classic, relaxed, at-the-beach pose, all right? Now that looks beautiful. Thank you. Ladies, I'm looking to change your lives and take you from zeros to heroes. Where I come from, I'm the "King of Queens." Who am I? King of Queens. Babes, what's my name? King of Queens. Sorry to disturb, ladies, but there's something I have to show you. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Shall we? - Babes, what's my name? - You'll see. - King of Queens. - You hear that? So where are we going? Through here, then we're gonna go through... - You're sure? - Very. Okay. I think I like the way you're holding me. I wish I knew what this was all about. I don't know what you have packaged for me, but all the same... You are gonna thank me for the surprise. You'll probably be sending me texts. Go, enjoy yourself. - Are you sure? - Go! - Be a good boy! - All right. - Hello! - Hello, how are you? - And who are these ones? - We're here for you. What is going on? Boss, is that you? With the kind of special treatment I was getting. I knew it was someone special with the kind of treatment I was given. I knew it could only be you that could arrange this. - Akpos. - When did you get into South Africa? Oh, well, I just wanted to... have a bit of a chitchat with you, get to know you better. Boss, is there much to know about me? I come from Warri, and organize beauty pageants. I mostly do comedy at those Warri houses. Houses? Oh, "axis." The Warri axis. Boss, I don't bother myself with English. Who has English "helped"? Right, right. So, you and Bianca, how did you manage to meet? Ah, Bianca was a small local girl. And I discovered she had huge talent so I decided to manage her. So you manage her in everything? Everything. So this whole Bianca thing, what's your plan? - I just want to give Bianca-- - Money? Yes, money! But the main focus is that I want to give Bianca joy. I also want to manage her talent and career to the next level. You can tell when you see the girl. Can't you? She's a world-class beauty. And then she won the Queen of Nigeria contest. Bianca is a natural-born winner. Right, right. And you say this whole thing is that you want to take her to the next level, right? I want to take her to the next level. - And you're ready for that? - Of course. I've been ready since before I was born. Even Joseph the dreamer hasn't got bigger dreams. His dreams are analog. Mine are digital. Okay. I like you, Akpos. Thank you, boss. Like you, I started with nothing. And so I can identify with your hustle. Thank you, boss. Okay. Boss? Open the passport. Open it. Boss? - American international passport? - Mm-hmm. With my face on it? And all of this... for you. What's going on, boss? How do I deserve all of this? Well, I've been watching you. I've been watching you. I see the way you have been managing. So we decided to send you to our Los Angeles office. So you go over there, nurture the girls and bring them to the next level. Boss, don't make me mad with excitement. There'll be no need for that. - Boss, you sending me to "Lost" Angeles? - No, Los Angeles. You want me to get lost? I will get lost! No, no, Akpos! Akpos. Oh, come on. Boss, I will get lost. - What do you think about Kim K? - Kim K? It's hard to tell, but I think she fancies me. She will go with you. Kim K will go with me? She will go with you and she will settle you in. And then remember: anything you want, anything at all... I'm just one phone call away. You won't give me all of this and I still bother you with a phone call. - Don't I have a conscience? - We have a deal? Boss, let me worship you, please! Bianca. Bianca, we have to talk, now! Bianca. Bianca. - So you could come back to me, Akpos? - Did I go anywhere? Are you questioning me? You must be mad. - Bianca. - Don't touch me! I guess you now have what you came here for in the first place. Bianca, calm down. What's wrong with you? Akpos! Your wicked act will catch up with you. Bianca... - Bianca. - What did you say? You're fired! Bianca? What's suddenly got into Bianca? - Darling. - What the hell do you want? I have a surprise for you. And you're going to love it. Yolanda, come with me. Shall we? Um... What's going on? Oh, you, my darling, have an important meeting. Please get ready. You look stunning. If this were Warri, we'd do hashtag give the money back. Anytime we say we want to do a comedy show. Do you see that? Did you see where I put it? I am the king of talents. Go away. Your jokes are boring! You're just there saying what you like. Hey, hey... Please, shut up. You can't be heckling my comedians like that. Can't you see the guy is boring? I am Akpos Oboroghenerukokwo Umukoro Dafe. The reigning comedy champion in Warri. That's where I come from, the Niger Delta region, Warri. Look, if I go up on stage, even my tears will make people laugh. I am the king of talents. I don't care what you think you are. Whether you think you're a comedian, or gynecology, whatever you think you are. Even if you are a comedian, Warri face or no Warri face, you need to wait for six months to come into my club and play, okay? Otherwise, shut up! Six months? Is comedy pregnancy? Shut up. This place is beautiful. Not half as beautiful as you are. I think I should go back. I didn't tell anyone I was leaving. Oh, you mean your manager? Akpos Obo-- Oborogheneruko-- I'm sorry. How did you meet a guy like that? Can we not talk about that please? - Right. - I'm sorry. That's okay, Your Majesty. Listen, I want you to come with me. I want to show you something. Come, it's okay. I won't bite you. Come. Tell him, he'll also look a lot better with 100-percent Nigerian cassava. Thank you very much. My name is... Warri face. Listen, you say you're a comedian, right? Before? Full-time comedian from the Niger Delta region. This other fool just messed up my thing, so do you want to jump in? - Jump in where? - On stage, what do you mean? You want me to come perform comedy? You should've said so. Hey, but make sure you are funny. You must be as good as you say you are. Of course. I am the definition of funny. - Okay, let's go. - My name is what you call "fu-nny." Wow. This is beautiful. I am not this beautiful. You are even more beautiful. Wow. I want you to have this. And more. Why are you doing all this? What do you want from me? Because you are special, Bianca. I want to give you the world. The universe at your feet, literally. I want to travel the world with you. Me and you. Take you to places that you've only dreamed about. You know, I had an interesting conversation with your manager the other day. And I'm really happy that I'm able to advance his career. He said you guys talked about it, and you were happy to see him leave. Leave to where? He didn't tell you? He's... He leaves for Los Angeles in a few days. And oh, by the way, him and my personal assistant, they seem to have gotten on quite well. She thinks that he's sexy. Look. I'll show you something, okay? - All of this is for me? - That's right. Boss, what have I done to deserve all this? You will go over to Los Angeles, and you will manage our talent while you're there. You are sending me to "Lost" Angeles? What do you think about Kim K? Kim K? It's hard to tell, but I think she fancies me. So we have a deal? Boss, let me worship you, please. Okay, okay, okay... Now, ladies and gentlemen, this guy comes all the way from Nigeria with the serious, original, organic Nigerian cassava. All the way from Warri state. Don't Warri, 'cause he's gonna make you laugh. Please give it up, Akpos! First off, my name is Akpos Oboroghenerukokwo Umukoro Dafe. You know, I like South Africans. When you see South African girls walk with their huge backsides. They walk like this, it feels so heavy. No wonder Mandela had "a long walk to freedom." So... What's the matter? Where are you all going? Okay, let's eat. Hmm? Okay. We don't get married to such, 'cause it occupies too much space.

Hey, how's it going? Your man left me hanging? You're just gonna bring some guy to the house now? - I told you, he's just a good friend. - A good friend? He's not even my type. You know I like my man, shoe size 12 and above. Baby, no. Uh-uh. No, no, we can't do that now. He needs help. His girlfriend is in trouble. What trouble? She's with Otunba Williams. Look, I don't know you. But I worked for that slimy, dirty, rich, son of a bitch for six years. And you know what he did to me? Stole my girl. Yeah. Kept bombarding her with all these expensive gifts. Gifts he knew I couldn't afford to buy her. And then when I tried to stop him, he set me up. Yeah. They found drugs in my apartment. Called the police. Police came over, they arrested me. I don't even know how to spell "drugs." Cops gave me six years. Just got out two months ago. So I'm telling you who you're dealing with. So... who is your girl? Her name's Kimberly, but now she's going by something like Kim K. Oh, Kim K is your girl? What do you want? Your shoot is at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, so the limo will pick you up at 7:00 and drop you back here at 8:00 p.m., all right? I have things to get from the hotel. That can be arranged. Will you just be ready at seven o'clock? What are you getting yourself into? How is this any of your business? You have it all. Look at you, you're beautiful. You have a career. You have a wonderful man that loves you, that will sacrifice his entire life for you. You just stay the hell out of my business. Is this the life that you want? You'll get the money. But at what price. You know... I used to think he was the sweetest guy in the beginning. But then... sooner or later I realized he wasn't, and then it was too late to leave. Why should I believe you? You don't have to. You can become a sex slave like me. Have alcohol as your number-one companion. Then stay. Please, by all means, I would appreciate a buddy. But if you want to follow your dreams, then I advise you to run, run as fast as you can. Otunba is the devil. And certainly, you don't deserve him. Akpos loves you. Don't you see this? That fool doesn't care about anybody but himself. He has been using me. Oh, and by the way, congratulations. Enjoy Los Angeles. Make sure you call me when he dumps you for an Americana. You have to see this video. All this is for me? I've seen this before. I bet you he didn't show it to you until the end. Boss, once I get to Los Angeles, Bianca and I will-- Wait, wait, wait. Bianca? Bianca's not coming with you. No, Bianca is coming. No. No, Akpos. She has to fulfill her contract. That's why you have your passport, the money, and Kim K. Yeah? Boss, Bianca isn't coming with me to "Lost" Angeles? No, no. She has to be here and fulfill her contract. Akpos. You're a smart boy. Make the right decision now. Boss. With all due respect... I do know that you're a powerful man, a man of timber and caliber. But boss, I'd like to make this clear to you, and at the same time clear my conscience with all consciousness. Bianca... I have not come to South Africa to auction Bianca. Bianca is not for sale. All this money means a lot and can change my life and that of my entire generation. We know the value of the dollar against the naira. But all of this means nothing to me. Compared to Bianca, it's all just paper to be ripped. America is not worth my Bianca. I'm out! This is big trouble! This is big trouble! Boss. Is the matter that serious? Boss. Can't you tell when someone is joking? Please don't kill me. I beg you. Twenty-four hours, Akpos. Twenty-four hours. Think about it. Thank you God of second chances! Oh, God of second chances. Thank you! I thank you, God of second chances. This is big trouble! This is big trouble! This is big trouble! This is big trouble! - Bianca. - What did you say? You're fired! Bianca! What has suddenly got into Bianca? Bianca! We have to talk. There's trouble! Tomorrow I'll have some news about your girlfriend. I've still got people on the inside. And they're gonna tell me what's up. It's kind of dangerous for you to go back to that hotel, so I suggest you just kick it here. Problem is I don't know what has possessed her. She doesn't even want to see me. Akpos... If Donald Trump can get America to vote for him, surely you can get your girlfriend to want see you again. It doesn't matter. Either way, you've gotta get her out of there. She's in bad hands. And I'm gonna tell you something, that's a bad dude. He's probably riding your girl right now, all up and down the hill, like a zebra, like a horny zebra, just riding your girl. What? I'm not Otunba. All right, ladies in the back... Where's Courtney? Forget about who's here. Just face the mirror. I'm here to save you. If you want you and Akpos to live, you listen to everything that I'm saying. Where is Akpos? Come on, bud, relax. Relax. Kim's got it under control. You all right? Trust me, man. But let me tell you something. We gotta get out of here fast. 'Cause once they realize she's missing, and they probably already realized it by now, we're gonna have some company. So we've got to go, man. So you're gonna tell these people you need to go to the toilet. - Okay. - And head for the small bridge. Follow the exit signs. You'll find Akpos and Ongime in a golf cart. - Who's Ongime? - No time for questions. The guard is looking at me. I can't go anywhere. Don't worry, I'll take care of the guard. - Okay. - We have to be quick. I need to go to the toilet. Hey. You look exactly like Denzel Washington, look at you. - Akpos! - No, no, no, no... Come on, y'all. This ain't no time for lovey-dovey. We've gotta go. Look at your shoe size. You know what they say about a man with big feet, eh? - Then told me what was going to happen-- - Holy shit! That's the wrong way. Wrong way! I think we can go with it. And if there are no objections, then we can roll with that. Cheers. Sir. - I need my iPad. - Okay, go get your iPad. Ooh! Careful, man. You need to talk to your woman. This is crazy. Stop the cart! Stop it! I'm going to get my iPad. - I'm not going to negotiate. - Hurry up! Now, I've got an iPhone, an iPad, and now I'm gonna die for Apple. Find her and bring her to me now. Gentlemen, this meeting is over. Excuse me. I swear to God, you have a spell over you. Hurry up! Akpos! Bianca! Bianca! Hey! Hey! Hey, damn, man, they got her. We gotta go! We gotta go! I told you this was a bad idea. Come on, move this thing! - How fast do you think it can go? - Move this thing now! Don't yell at me. Don't you yell at me! Move faster, move faster. Bianca! Can you see what an iPad has caused? - Move this thing! - Don't you yell at me! I swear to God, I'll pull this cart right over into a safari and let a lion tear your black ass up. What is going on? Are we lost? What the hell is wrong with you? Turn around! You've got that way, that way, that way. How the hell am I supposed to know where to go? - This side! - No, no, no. That's the way we came from. Hold on, man. Let me pull over. I've gotta figure this out. Okay, we came this way. And... Wait, wait. You passed this sign. - No, we came that way. - No, no, no! Okay. Are you gonna look? - Akpos! Akpos! Akpos! - Come on! - There she goes. - See there! Drive, drive. Go fast! I can't go any faster! You think you can go faster, then you run! Ah! - Bianca! Bianca! - I was kidding! Bianca! Bianca! I was kidding! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? Bianca... Bianca! - Hey! - Don't you talk to me! - What are you doing? I was kidding! - Bianca! Bianca! Who do you think you are, Usain Bolt? Get in, let's go! Bianca! Twenty-four hours? What the hell? Look, my girl was taken right before my very own eyes and you're talking 24 hours? Listen, we don't live here. We're from Nigeria. I beg you in God's name. Why do you need 24 hours? Wait, let me try. Listen, you have to understand... What he's trying to say to you is she could be dead in 24 hours! They're gonna kill her. What do you want me to tell people back home? Man, come on, he ain't joining us. We gotta do it on our own. Aren't you police? Can't you help? We gotta do this on our own. He ain't going here. I know! Leave me alone. All I wanted... was your friendship. Hmm? And I tried to do it the gentlemanly way. But you had to ruin it. Now, I am pissed off. And as if refusing my offer of friendship wasn't bad enough, you were actually trying to break your business contract by running away! I wasn't running away. - Don't you lie to me. - I wasn't running away. Don't you lie to me! Now, I'm willing to forget all of this, if you just take my offer of friendship. If it's friendship that you want, then it's no problem. I can be your friend. Aww, sweet girl. She's such a sweet girl. Hmm? You... You will get ready. You will look pretty. You will attend the stakeholders' banquet, okay? What's funny now, hmm? - What are you laughing about? - Akpos is a real man. And he knows exactly how to get his woman. He's coming for me. Aww! He's coming for you. Oh, laugh all you want. You will never be half the man Akpos is. Oh, but... Akpos is not coming. He has been taken care of. If you don't behave yourself, you will also be taken care of. Now get her away from me. Oh, Lord... You need to relax. You need to have something to eat. Get some sleep. You can't just be like this. You know my man is doing everything to help you. - What else do you want us to do? - Yeah, man. Write a placard and take it to Otunba's place? Hashtag "bring back Bianca." Hey, Bianca's gonna be okay. Come on, man. Man up, bro. It's gonna be all right. Trust me. I used to be in the military, man. I know this stuff. That's the reason Otunba wanted me. Trust me. If he finds out I'm out, I promise you, he's gonna be coming after us. My guys, with all due respect to the army, all I want is Bianca. "Bianca, Bianca, Bianca." Goddamn, come on, bro. It's gonna be all right. You gotta believe, man. Come on! You'll get your Bianca back. - Please help me if you want to-- - Shh! Get down, get down. Okay, we gotta stay down. We gotta move. Don't block my short road to freedom. Move this madiba from my way. AK-47! Shh! Wait, wait. You can't use these. You see the guy with the bullet? Yeah, that's good. I need you to go and find the bottles. Find yourself some bottles, and draw their fire. Okay? Yes! This is big trouble! Stop! Akpos! - What the hell did he say? - I say, "Go to hell." - I'll bust you-- - Wait, wait, wait. I haven't got time for this. He doesn't want to talk? Let me tidy him up... Guy. Guy? Where is my girl? What did he say? He said, "In his shit hole." Oh! Okay. Hold him! My girl is in your butthole? My girl is in your butthole? My girl is in your butthole? Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. Okay, listen. This guy's got some serious security. I picked up about 20 guards. So here's the plan. I need you to go to the front, baby. I need you to just create a distraction, okay? Why me? It's gonna be okay, baby. Listen. Trust me, we're gonna be there. All right, now in the back, there's a really low fence. You and I, we're gonna go in the back, we're gonna jump over that fence. And then we have to blend in with the crowd, okay? All right, the problem is... he has a dog. I don't even like doggy-style, so I'm definitely going in the front. Good, you go in the front. All right? Dog or no dog, every Goliath goes down here today. Akpos says so! Yes! That's the attitude. Now keep that attitude. Now let's go, come on. In six years, Otawi Cosmetics has become the giant of Africa. But we want to compete. We want to go into Europe, the Americas, and Asia.
