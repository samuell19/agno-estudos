(heavy electronic music) (crowd cheering) - I put my money on Chuck. (fists thudding) - Kill him, goddammit! (plane whooshing) - Hello, I'm Susanna Carter. I have a reservation. - Please fill out this form, ma'am. How long are you staying? - Just overnight. But I will be needing a wake up call for 6:30 in the morning. - Yes, ma'am. Feel at home. Have a nice day. - Thank you. (ominous electronic music) (flowing electronic music) - Hi, how you doing? - Is Pete around? - I'm Pete, what do you need? - Vanessa Goodman. Do you know her? - She rents a room from me. She hasn't been around for weeks. - Sounds like you keep pretty close tabs on her. - Well, generally I mind my own business. Just so happens I've been trying to give her a telegram for a week or so. - May I see it? The telegram's from me. I'm Susie Carter, Bonnie's sister. Vanessa Goodman's just a by-law. - Hey Rey. Where's that telegram of Bonnie's? - It's in her room. I slipped it under her door. - That's the one I sent. (fists thudding) - Get off of me! (roaring) Hey, you're okay. - How did this happen anyway? - They're looking for trouble, let's give it to 'em! Bonnie never went anywhere without her camera. - What makes you think she's in trouble? - She told me. She said she couldn't explain it on the phone. - She's probably out visiting some friends. - Couldn't be that. She said she had a big story. - Let me see that. Chuck Donner. - Who's he? - He's bad news. - Where can I find him? - Works down the arena for Erik Stallard. Drugs, prostitution, gambling. I don't think you want to meet him. - Guess again. (dramatic electronic music) - Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the arena and another night of martial arts entertainment. And for the first exhibition, we present to you the exponent of the honka style, Mr. Lou Conbleu! (crowd applauding) - Chuck! Who's she? - I don't know, I've never seen her before. - Go check her out. Woman who walks into my place like she's looking for something is not just another dame. Now check her out. - Yes sir. In case you're not aware of it, this club is off limits to all military personnel and their dependents. - I'm independent, over 21, and just passing through. - Gin. So you're a black belt. - That's right. And I'm looking for a place to work out. I heard about you, so here I am. - I still don't get the connection. I mean, there are many gyms in this town. Why this club? - I need a place to work out. If I can get paid for doing it, so much the better. - You putting me on? - Try me. - Wait here. (exciting fanfare music) - And here they are, fight fans! Big Billy and Bruno! - I want you to watch this. May just change your mind. - No holds barred. - So this kid stuff is supposed to convince me this is strictly for men? (crowd applauding) - You think you can take that? - If the money's right. - I'm not talking money. I'm talking physical punishment. - I can take it. - I have 500 dollars says you can't go three minutes with Bruno. - Rack 'em up. (heavy electronic music) (crowd applauding) - You're pretty good. - You still find me amusing? - Well, let's change that to interesting. - You're still trying to size me up, aren't you? - I like your style. But if you're trying to pull some kind of scam, forget it. - I'm just trying to pay the rent. - We'll let you know. In the meantime, don't call us, we'll call you. - Rey! What are you doing here? - Thought you might need a ride. - Okay. - She's good. Too good. - She's a martial arts teacher. Six damn black belt. Owns her own dojo in LA. Out here on vacation. - Vacation! - You get on her tail, charm her, do whatever you have to. But find out her real reason. - Except I gotta get closer. A little more on the inside. - You teach martial arts, right? - Right. - Ever hear of arnis? - That's the thing they do with the sticks. - Yeah. A special form of defense unique to the Philippines. - That's it, you're here to research arnis! - There are several schools on the island, and one of the master gurus lives on the nearby mountain. Bonnie did the story on it. - She did? - To what, pray tell, do we owe this great honor? - Don't worry, I'm here to see a lady. Not you. - Maybe the lady has something to say about that. - It's nice to see someone has taste around here. (smooth guitar music) (singing in foreign language) - Thank you. You know, I didn't expect you to call so soon. Much less know where to find me. - Well, it's not everyday a fox like you comes into town. I'd be a fool to pass up this opportunity. - Is that the reason for this dinner? - You might say. - You might say what? You said you liked everything straight. - Okay, fair enough. I'm here to check out your credentials. - For an exhibition match? - That's nothing compared to what I might have planned for you. - I'm listening. - First, we have a lot of getting to know you to do. - Did she talk? - You gotta understand, Grip's a little paranoid. He doesn't like strangers in his part of the forest. - This Mata Hari, she's got you by the balls! - Stay out of this, Grip. Do you think she's clean? - Yeah, she's fine. She doesn't want to cause problems for anyone. - Yeah, well she better not. - She wants to work here. - Screw her! - I intend to, but that's not the point. Look, Humpty-Dumpty here might not think so, but I think she could add some color to the games and the club. - I'll think about it. - Why don't you give her a break? She could use the money. - We got enough problems without worrying about getting some female karate expert a job. Grip, is everything under control? - My contacts will have the merchandise available. I only hope that lover boy here gets the money to us on time. - It'll be there, Grip. - That's enough out of both of you for right now. Now get your asses out of here. - About the girl... - Look, I told you, forget about the girl for now. - I have a feeling we haven't heard the last of that girl. (light instrumental music) (speaking foreign language) - He asks what he can teach you that you still do not know. - Arnis. (speaking foreign language) - Why do you wish to learn arnis? - My knowledge of the martial arts would not be complete without it. (speaking foreign language) - The fruits of wisdom fall on different lands on different times. You are right in gathering all you can. (speaking foreign language) Only be cautioned against violence. Arnis is a form of defense. Were the sticks meant for killing, they would have sharp edges. - I understand. - Seems to me like Chuck is getting a little out of control. - I can handle him. - I don't know why you bother. - Simple, I need him to keep an eye on Grip. - That's another one. He's absolutely useless, not to mention crude. - No, I need Grip. He's the contact for the suppliers. - That's just it. Like I've said time and again, why can't you buy past Grip, make contact with the suppliers yourself? - You underestimate Grip. He's a clever old bastard. He's not about to let anybody get next to his suppliers. - I'm sure you can think of a way if you only put your mind to it. - Don't you worry about it. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of things myself. - I was just trying to help. (energetic electronic music) - Sir, we lost him. - I was hoping this would not be necessary. - I could scream and call the police, you know. - I am the police. I want you to lay off Chuck Donner. - What's the matter, you jealous? - Go home, this is no place for you. Bonnie found out the hard way. - Where is she? - We don't know yet. Look, if you interfere, we'll never be able to solve this case. - Okay, I'll stay out of your way. (loud drum music) (speaking foreign language) - What in the hell is going on here? - It's what they call a fiesta. - Well how in the world do you expect your suppliers to get us the stuff with this crowd watching all the time? - You are not supposed to ask the questions, my friend. You are just a lackey who carries the money. Would you be kind enough to hand it to me? - I don't like it. - Is it all here? - Well why don't you just take it out and count it in front of all these people, fish-brain. - Good day. It's ready, come. Uh-huh. (speaking foreign language) - I want you to scare 'em off, then get the stuff. (tense electronic music) Positions! (guns banging) (speaking foreign language) - Wait, you can't go in there Grip! (speaking foreign language) - Boss... - You know damn well I don't like being disturbed when I'm ranking the fighters. - I know, boss, I know. But this is important. - It damn well better be. - We lost the shipment. - What? The shipment? - My men murdered. Not a trace who did it. - How did it happen? Oh nevermind, I don't want to know how. I want to know why. Now you get your ass out on the street, talk to every Tom, Dick, and Harry. Check on their faces. I want that shipment back, and I want the bastards who ripped me off. (light electronic music) - No, no! - Welcome to our little question and answer session. - Would you mind telling me what this is all about? - I am here to ask the questions. You are here to provide the answers. - Not until I know what's going on. - It seems you don't quite understand the seriousness of this little meeting. - That's right, I haven't the foggiest idea! - Perhaps you need a little convincing. This is my little concoction of truth serum. You answer the question correctly, the snake stays locked up. You tell a lie, it is released. I warn you, the Philippine Cobra is the deadliest of its kind. Tell me... Where did you go yesterday morning? - I went for a ride. You know, touring the countryside. - Sightseeing? Is that all? - That's all. - You were at the ambush, weren't you? - What ambush? - What is your purpose here in Olongapo? - Okay. I'm a martial arts instructor by profession. I'm here to study the arnis technique. In the meantime, I'm looking around for a way to support myself. - What is your real purpose here in Olongapo? - I just told you! - You lie! You work for the police! - I don't work for the police. They picked me up for questioning, that's all. - Aha! You were with the police yesterday! This is the moment of truth, Susanna. Why are you here in Olongapo? Who sent you? - I came on my own. How many times do I have to tell you that? - Who ambushed us yesterday? Who? - I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. - You informed the police, you had us ambushed! Admit it, admit it! (intense electronic music) (speaking foreign language) - You have the situation well in hand. - You might say I had to snake my way through. - I was worried about you. - Thanks anyway. - You look like you could use a drink. - You are a mind reader. - One of my many talents. - So how does one earn enough to afford this kind of luxury? - One uses his head. Decides what he wants, then goes after it. - You seem to be quite successful. - I'm persistent. - I can see what you mean. - I can also be... Very passionate. - And how are you on patience? - Hmm. But don't make me wait too long. I hate suspense. - Frankly, so do I. - I'm gonna get a drink. - I heard about Grip bringing that girl in for questioning. I hear Chuck got in the way. - You hear too much. - I have a right to know some things. Chuck's mind is so full of that girl. - He's found a new toy, leave him be. - But he's giving her a run of the place! He wants to take her to the training camp. - Look, I asked him to take her there. I want to see her in the arena of death. She's got killer instincts, I can sense it. I want her to know that we sanction a fight to the death. - What makes you think she's that way? - Once you learn how to kill, you often wonder if you'll ever do it. But you never get a chance, except in a war or a fight to the death. There's no war that she can join, there's no one to tango with her, except my gladiators. (energetic electronic music) - I'm impressed. Overwhelmed. - There's more, you haven't seen it all yet. - Bring her to the fights tonight. (nunchucks whooshing) (crowd cheering) - Well, what do you think? - Uh... - I mean, is this the kind of thing that you think you might be interested in trying? - Frankly I don't think it's something I want to get involved with. - A true fighter fights to kill. Otherwise it's only a game. (tense electronic music) - Hey baby! What are you doing tonight? Hey baby, come on back! - Help, these guys are after me! - Okay, hold it! - Don't shoot mister! - I said hold it! - I've contacted my suppliers. Arranged for a delivery of another shipment tomorrow. - What's the method of delivery? - For security reasons I am compelled to retain that information. You understand my little precautions. - Yes, but I would like to take a few myself. I mean, just to make sure the shipment doesn't get ripped off like the last one. - The more you know about this transaction, the greater the risk. I must refuse. - You don't quite understand. I'm not giving you a choice. I'm giving you an escort. Chuck goes along on the pickup. - The arrangements have been made. Bringing a conspicuous American will only draw attention to me and my men. - He goes or there's no deal. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Chuck] Susie, hi, it's Chuck! - Hello Chuck. - Yeah, listen, I gotta go away for a couple of days so you won't be seeing me for a while. Call you when I get back? - Okay. - [Chuck] All right, talk to you later. - Bye. (light drum music) (speaking foreign language) - I don't want to use this. Don't make me. I'm Alu Juarez. Lieutenant JG. Undercover. Narcotics division on Thai narcotics unit. - Police woman? - And you're Susanna Carter. Born October 17, Augusta, Georgia. Physical education graduate from UCLA. Six time black belt. Undefeated karate champion. And you're here looking for your sister, Bonnie. Alias Vanessa Goodman. There's a whole lot more if you're interested. - How long have you been working with Erik? - Longer than I care to remember. - And Bonnie, what about Bonnie? Do you know anything about her? - I couldn't warn her without blowing my cover. Seems she stumbled on the dope run. Much like you did. Erik didn't like that. - Where is she? - I don't know. No one seems to know. - Can't you find out? - Let's see what I can do about it. But you've got to tow your end of the line. Don't tell anybody about my being here. (tense electronic music) - Hit it. (engine revving) (booming) - All right, I hope you guys know what kind of fix we're in. We are in bad shape. First we gotta get the bastards who ripped off the shipment. Chuck, I'm holding you responsible for that. Grip, get in touch with your suppliers. Arrange for an open line of credit. - It's impossible. - Nothing is impossible. - They will not listen to me. - You don't have a choice. They won't listen to you, let me talk to 'em. Otherwise, we close shop. It's that simple. - I will think about it. - I can't get over it. How did you convince Grip? - Let's just say that I made him an offer that he couldn't refuse. - When is it set for? - He didn't want to tell me. He was afraid I might eliminate him altogether. - What about Chuck? - Chuck? He won't even go to the john without my permission. - Never take anything for granted. - Baby, I don't take anything for granted. Not even you. I know what I'm doing. - What if Grip can prove that Chuck was really behind it? - He won't have to prove it. - The meeting has been set, but I don't have the exact details yet. - When will you know? - That's the problem. Grip isn't taking any chances. It could be any time, any place. - Great. Another 48 hour red alert. - I'll get word to you as soon as anything's definite. Beat's place? - Mm-hmm. I'll have everyone ready at a moment's notice. - The way Grip's playing it, that's just about all you'll get. I gotta go. I think Bruno's onto me. Oh yes, about Bonnie Carter. You talk to Chin, he knows. - Sorry to put you through this, but we need you to identify the body. We found her in the river. (tense drum music) (gasping) (cars honking) (doorbell ringing) - It's open. Susie, what's the matter? Let's talk about it. - No. Please. Let's not talk. (crashing) Hold me! (light piano music) I can feel the blood pulse inside your head. You're so good. You're so good. - You idiot. You know, here I thought you had some smarts, but no, you can't even get rid of a body without it turning up for the whole world to see. - All right, look, so I blew it. But there's no way they can trace that body back to us. - I don't like it. The meeting is all set for tonight. I'll call the suppliers and cancel it. - No. Maybe it's better this way. Police will be preoccupied trying to solve the murder. It'll give them something to do while we go ahead with the meeting as planned. - Sorry I had to meet you here, but I think I'm being followed. - Okay. But keep it short and sweet. - It'll have to be. Grip sprung the meeting out of the blue and it's set for tonight. You've got to move now. Close in on the arena if you want to catch them all together. - Anything else? - About Bonnie. Chuck killed her. She was gonna do a story on Erik's old setup. - Are you sure about that? - I'm sorry. - Look, I know what you're thinking, but don't do it. You leave Chuck to me. He'll be behind bars within the hour, I promise. Just what I need. - She's gotta be stopped. - I'll get her. (light electronic music) - Chuck! Chuck! - Susie! Let the police handle this. They know what they're doing. I know how you feel, but I won't let you throw away your life like this. - The boys are all set. You stay here, that's an order. Your job's over. - Tony! - Hold it! (guns banging) Don't talk. We'll get him for you. - Mr. Stallard, this is Susie. I want to fight tonight, the death bout. - Good. I knew you wouldn't be able to resist the challenge. - But I mean right now. It's gotta be on my terms. - Whatever you say. - He's on his way up. - Well, then you know what to do. (dramatic electronic music) - The suppliers are here. They're all waiting at the club. - Good. I lied to you. Purposefully ripped off my own shipment. Deceived you into thinking that I needed to work out some sort of direct credit arrangement with you. My apologies, gentlemen, for that little misrepresentation. But it was the only way that I knew how to remove Grip and deal directly with you. Well gentlemen, this is it. To the arena of death. I'm sure you're all going to enjoy this. - So this is what we've been hearing so much about. - Except that tonight is going to be a little different. This will be the first time a woman will be fighting in this arena. - I'm not fighting any of you. I want him. - All right, what seems to be the problem? - I challenge him. My terms, remember? - Chuck, you're on. - What is this? - Bonnie's my sister. - Hey, I don't want to fight you. There's gotta be a better way. Look, I'm sorry. What can I say? (intense electronic music) - Police are here! - What? - I'm getting out of here. - Get out of my way! - What the hell is this? - Come on, let's get out of here! God damn police are here! Come on! - All right, outside, all of you. Come on. Move! - Stallard! - Rey, no! Don't do it. I want him. (energetic electronic music) (upbeat electronic music)
