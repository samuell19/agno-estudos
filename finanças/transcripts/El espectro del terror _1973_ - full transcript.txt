Maria, a towel please. Thank you. I don't know how I'm doing it, but I haven't got time even for a decent shower. Your car is in the garage, by the way. No one has your problems, of course. 15 days off work and when you come back you find a ghost. Anyway... I think you're nervous, that's all. Let me have a smoke. I haven't got time even to light a cigarette. I can't get that man's face out of my mind. Or whatever he is. I'm not insane. I've never lost my mind. You know me well. What will the old Captain say when he realises I'm your substitute? Pity he's married. Because he's so good looking. And he's in love with you, too. Stop it, don't talk nonsense. Damn shoe. Where is it? I'm sure there's a playful ghost in here. Good bye, Maria, wish me luck! Good luck! By the way... Is that ghost a good looking one or an ugly one? He was ugly! A hideous being. What's wrong, Miss? It's nothing, thank you. The doctor is busy. I'll tell him. You're welcome. The most distressing feeling for an human being is loneliness. The emptiness that hits us, that makes us victims, prone to abnormal psychological situations that can drive us to suicide or madness. Note that it has always happened when you're alone. We'll try to make you powerful, stronger, in order to fight that weakness of yours that I would label as anguish. I've never considered myself weak but perhaps you're right. Loneliness has always been one of my problems. I want to know everything about that strange character. The clothes he's wearing, You'll even have to tell me about their colours. I don't know... I can only remember his eyes, his pale and haggard complexion. And his hands, those long and skinny fingers. Nothing else. I'm sorry, it's impossible. I'm overwhelmed by fear. Relax. Be quiet. Doctor, she's waiting for you. Thank you. - You're welcome. You're a surprising woman. What are you doing here? I need to talk with you, I'm pretty anxious. Don't you mind? I was waiting for you in my consulting room. - Yes. But I can't wait. It's alright. I'll be right back. I have to change clothes. I'm waiting here? No, at the bar. Be right back. - I hope so. You could have been a great jockey. Please, Carlos, red wine. Listen. I'm going to help you, but I need your help. Do you think horses are happy at the riding school? Even if they are used to jockeys riding them? Well, no. Even tamed, they can send you to the ground. There's something outside trying to hurt you. You must fully trust me. As if I were your horse? What I really need is nothing but sympathy. If someone complains about something you always think it's pure paranoia. You have to believe in what I say. Well... If you want to help me, of course. But I believe you. Don't forget that I'm a psychiatrist though. And that I also work with the police occasionally. But most important, I'm your friend. This comes from the manager. This Monday you're assigned to flight 914. Take care, miss. Miss, your door is open, it's dangerous. Thanks, you're very kind. What do you want? Full tank. What are you laughing about? Just nonsense. I've always dreamt about a charming prince and suddenly I meet a ghost. Cheers to us. Yes, to us. I like to see you laughing. But we have to talk about you. I'd like to know your co-workers. Come on, Maria, make an effort. Does that man look like someone you know? I can't answer that. I don't want to think about it now. We're here to enjoy ourselves, right? So let's enjoy! Loneliness is over. Isn't it the solution, doctor? - Exactly. Waiter. More champagne? We should go. It's getting late. Something's wrong? They told me you had a nice nap. They have discharged you from work for one month. We'll go together to the places where you've seen that strange creature. So you still don't believe me? I believe you, Maria. But you need an encephalogramme. I've had enough tests, I'm not mad! I saw that man, I swear! Why don't you believe me? Why don't you help me instead of asking all those questions? That man is real, he's after me! He's stalking me! Nurse. Give her a sedative. This is where I saw him for the first time. The night watchman said that you had a nervous breakdown but there was no one inside the car. I'm certain I saw him. Well... We'd better go to the club. Two whiskies. Wait a moment, I have to make a phone call. I just saw him! It's him! He went that way! He's gone. In that car. You better hurry up, I have to take it back tomorrow. Don't be in a hurry, you'll get it in time. You're always in a hurry. Antonio, give me a hand. You get prettier by the day. We should have a date. - Leave me alone. I mean it. You're a scoundrel, get off! Charley, a man's asking for you. There he is. Are you looking for me? Charley Reed? Your passport please. - I don't have it with me. Never mind, I know your police record. When have you seen Maria Preston for the last time? I don't know her. She's the stewardess from the Trans-Oceanic. I know several stewardesses, I work for the Airport. What did you do last night after work? Last night? I was tired and went to bed early. I must get back to work, Inspector. Do you mind if I sit here? Leave them like that. Take one of those. Don't you burn yourself? I'll have a whisky. You didn't tell me your name. - It doesn't matter. I'm Nicole. Well, my real name is Pepita. I have a son, that's why I'm working here. But I don't like this place. You seem different from the others. Finish your glass and let's go. You're fast, boy. I'm finishing it, it's too expensive to spoil. They never serve us real whisky. I'll be waiting outside, hurry up. Hands off! You're hurting me! You're odd. Show me the money or I'm getting out! You know what? I like you. Where are you taking me? Here it is. Get in. Nice house, boy. It still lacks furniture. I rented it like this. You want a drink? I'd prefer a bed, I'm so sleepy. Don't you want some whisky? You know what? I'm shy. - You're weird. You didn't bring me here to give you drawing lessons. I...want... to dance with you. Teach me how to dance. I'd better leave, I'll get a taxi. This house is far from the city. Call one by phone. I don't have a phone. - Well, I'll walk. Wait! Wait a moment. Here. That enough? Now we're talking. What do you want me to do? Dance, dance with me. That's a very old record player you have. Come on, move your body, flatfoot! Keep dancing. That's enough. Where's the bedroom? Upstairs. I'm going to bed. We have received the records of the man you're looking for. His name is Charley Reed. Vietnam veteran. 27 years old. He has worked for the same international service company in Chicago, Caracas, Mexico and now Madrid. I received the information from the company's laundry service. He's a professional dyer, like his father. That's all we have on him. That's interesting. Unknown address but we'll find it out soon. He has a mail box at 52, Nueva street. Can you find out why he left Chicago, Mexico and Caracas? It won't be easy, but we'll try. I think my patient is a victim of this character. Excuse me? - I'd like you to help me catch him. They are waiting for you at X-Rays. Helena O'Hara, right? - How do you know? Helena O'Hara, 25 years old. Twenty-two Stewardess, dangerously blond, freckles and many suitors for sure. Did you set up that meeting to talk about my suitors? No, I want you to tell me about your friend, Maria Preston. She might be in danger. So, it wasn't a ghost? We don't know yet. Tell me, when did you see her for the last time? When I arrived at home this morning she wasn't at the apartment. And I won't see her since I'm flying to Stockholm now. Tell me about Maria and her friends. Maria is my best friend but we don't see each other too often. When I'm in home, she is not, and vice versa. And her friends? I barely know them. Did she look somewhat uncomfortable lately? Maria spends too much time alone and besides she's a little apprehensive. When she told me about that ghost chasing her I didn't take her seriously - That ghost could be a real criminal. Who would want to hurt Maria? Are you married? No, I'm single, but don't forget that I'm the one who asks questions. Let's have a drink and continue our conversation. What are you doing here? Let me introduce you some friends. Come with us. Waiter, a bottle of whisky! This is Charley, we were in Vietnam together. You remember? But you're supposed to be insane. Last time we saw each other was in San Francisco. I testified as a witness. They said he had killed a woman! Poor Charley! You were afraid of women, right, Charley? But you've changed. Look. Come on, kiss her. Enough, man! You're too stupid, I don't know how you could have killed that woman. You really killed a woman? I'll be right back. How many women have you killed, Charley? This postcard's for you, miss. Can I make a phone call? Dr. Palacios, please. Yes, I'm Maria Preston Please tell him that I called. I'm on my way to the airport to meet my friend Elena. You'll never open that door. Don't touch me! Why are you locking me? Listen. I don't want to hurt you. I won't hurt you, listen to me. I don't want to hurt you. Open, open please! I want to get out of here! Don't tire yourself screaming. No one can hear you, no one! I'll be right back, I swear. I'll tell you later, I don't know yet Meeting you just now means so much to me. Come with me. I'm off in half an hour. I'm pretty tired, no one can stand a non stop 48 hours flight, you know. I know all about high winds, belated departures etc...but come on, we have just half an hour! Did you notice the high wind? We have 30 minutes left. I'm glad to see you. I'm so happy. Don't exaggerate. - It's true. After all this time without seeing each other. I don't really like that lifestyle of ours. Why? - We're always in a hurry. We don't have enough time for the important things in life. Well, it's better than nothing, I suppose. You're wonderful, Elena. And you are a scoundrel, but I like you. Really? Call the Inspector, tell him we're at the airport and we saw the killer's car. You're sick, Charley! I'm a doctor, I can heal you. You can't hide from yourself. You need a proper treatment. Charley, are you listening? I won't hurt you. Trust me. I'm a doctor. Listen, Charley, the police will be here anytime. I'm the only one able help you. Understand? Want a cigarette? Hello, are you alright? I've been waiting for a friend for over an hour. Perhaps she forgot about it. I know you. I work here, in the airport. Get in. Another 8 hours flight. Bahamas, Buenos Aires, Azures, Lisbon, Madrid. Only for 30.000 pesetas a month. I'm fed up with flying. I admire those mothers raising seven children at home. My mother had no other occupation than her home. I wish it was written in my passport: Occupation, housework. I want to take those laundry baskets at home first, if you don't mind. Then I can take you home. Stop me at some phone booth please, I have to make a phone call. There's one. I'll be right back. Where are you? You can't get away! Answer me! Don't make me kill you. I like you. I'm alone, you understand? I want you to stay with me forever! I respect you. Yes, I respect you. Only you can help me. I'm alone and afraid of myself. Why me? What have I done to you? Murderer, criminal! Easy, Charley. Don't make me kill you. Give me the keys. Let me get out, please! Give me the keys! I need your help. I am sick! I don't want to hurt you. I know. Give me the keys! I want to get out of here! Yes. - Come on, hurry up! Here. Take them. Don't be afraid. I don't want to kill you. Don't be afraid. No! Get off me!
