(Bridgestone jingle music) (mellow guitar music) (Mike sighs) - Okay, here's some juice. There you go. - [Mike] I'm Michael, but everyone calls me Mike. That's my little sister, Faith. - Mom, Mike has my pen. - [Mike] She's a pain. - Honey, stop harassing him and you know what? I'm going to make this to go so you can eat it in the car, okay? - [Mike] That's my dad. - Hey Mike, you and Faith better hurry up. You're gonna be late. - [Mike] He's a pastor which means, well it means all kinds of things. But right now it means we're new to town. It's not being in a new town that bothers me. I mean, it seems like New Hope is a nice place and all, but it's my senior year in high school and who wants to start over during their senior year? That's my mom. - Hey, Boo Boo, what are you thinking about? - [Mike] She's really a great mom, but I hate it when she calls me that. - Mom, please, don't call me that. And I was thinking, it's stupid to start school on a Friday. I mean, why don't we just wait until Monday? - At least it makes for a short school week. - You know, actually, I don't want to do this at all. I want to go back to Lakewood. - Honey, I know, but... - Mom, this is my senior year. - Mike, let's go. Hey darling, bye bye. Hey, he's going to be all right. - I think it's time that you give him that fatherly advice that you've been talking about. - Tonight. I'm all over it. - Okay. - See ya tonight. (sighs) - Daddy, what does, this sucks, mean? - Put your seat belt on and we'll discuss it later. - But Mike said... - Put your seat belt on and we'll discuss it later. - Meaner. - Look, I know this isn't how you envisioned your senior year, but this is where God has us right now. - Well he has my permission to change it whenever he's ready. - Oh and remember, Coach Miller agreed to add you to the basketball team. We're meeting him at three o'clock today. - Great. - Daddy, we're going to be late. - All right, all right, we're goin', we're goin'.

(gentle rock music) (students chatter) - Okay class, let's get started. I would like to first introduce you to Michael Evans, our new student. - [Class] Hi, Michael. - I would also like to remind you that next Friday, we will have grief counselors on campus. And if you would like to speak with one, you will need to go by the school office and sign up. - [Mike] The counselors were there because of the tragic death of a student. It was coming up on the one year anniversary of Chase taking his own life. No one saw it coming and it left a deep scar on the entire community. Especially the students. - [Secretary Over Intercom] Your 10 o'clock appointment's here. - You can send him in. (gentle music) Hi, come on in. That's him over there, Coach Miller. - [Mike] I know, Dad. - He's a great guy, you'll see. He was on the committee that brought me here to New Hope. - [Mike] Dad, you told me like a hundred times. - And that's Lucas there, the big kid. When Chase was on the team they called them the twin towers. Hey, I want to introduce you to the coach. Hey coach! Coach Miller! - Hey, Brother Alex. So this must be Michael. Your dad's told me a lot about you. It sounds like you're gonna be a great addition to our team. - Oh, he's a great player. You'll see. - Well, it looks like you have everything in there. Head onto the locker room and get dressed. (gentle music) - Tom, I really appreciate what you're doin'. This move has been pretty tough on Mike. - Actually, you're doing us a favor as well. The loss of Chase last year left a hole in our lineup that we haven't been able to fill. We really need another post player. Especially with the playoffs coming. - So, how's the team been handling it? - About what you would expect. Lucas is the one I'm most concerned about. I've been working with kids for years. But this is the first time I've ever had to deal with something like this. - I wonder if there's something we could do to help. I mean the church and all. - Yeah, yeah, it sounds like a great idea. Hey, I better get back to it. (whistle blows) Hey, everybody in, everybody in. Guys, this is Michael Evans. He's new here in town. And now, a part of this team. All right, let's get down to business. Playoffs start next week. And I'm not happy with the amount of turnovers we've been having in the last few games. If we want to win this thing, that has to stop. - Coach, you always say that. - Green, mark my words. Play like that in the playoffs and it'll be a short trip. All right, let's get in our four on four half court offense drills. Give me Green, Hampton, Wallace. Spence against Richardson, Benson, Harris and Evans. Evans, play the post against Green. Okay, here we go. Tyler, I need you to really pressure Spence. - Hey there, I'm Michael. - Do us all a favor and quit the team. - [Coach] Force him to pass the ball. - Trust me, I don't want to be here anymore than you want me to be. - [Coach] Now let's get it goin'. - Like I said, quit the team now. - Hey, you two love birds ready? - Yeah, I got it. - [Coach] Okay, here we go. (whistle blows) (dramatic music) (whistle blows) Green, what was that? - What's your deal, man? - What are you gonna do about it, huh? What are you gonna do? - [Mike] You're crazy. - Say it again. I said say it again! - Knock it off! That's it, Green. Head to the showers. - This ain't over. - Hey, everybody take five. You okay? - This was a bad idea. - Lucas has had a tough time lately. I don't know if you know but... - Yeah, yeah, I know. - Yeah, well it's been tough on all of us. Especially Luke. - No offense, Coach, but I just, I really don't think this is gonna work out. - Whoa, hold on a sec. This team needs you. - Needs me? I think my dad has misled you about my basketball skills. - Mike, don't take this the wrong way, but when your dad talked to me about you joining the team, it wasn't your basketball skills that interested me. These guys need a positive role model. Someone their age. - [Mike] And that's the biggest problem with being a preacher's kid. - Okay, I'm going to go check on Luke. - [Mike] It holds us to a different standard. Like we have all the answers. Truth is, I have my struggles just like all the rest. Besides, I don't even know these guys. They're not going to listen to me even if I could help. - I guess I shouldn't ask how your first day of school went today, huh? Honey, I know this isn't easy... - Mom, please, don't give me the God's plan speech, please. - Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not... - Honey, would you go and get ready for supper, please. - But I'm not done with my homework yet. - I know, but a short break would be okay. - Typical, conversation gets good and you send me to my room. (Mike sighs) - Hey, remember when we moved last time? And how much you hated Lakewood at first? And then after a while you said it was the greatest place on earth? Give this place a chance. - Mom, there's a big difference between the mountains of Lakewood and the swamps of New Hope. - I know this place is different, but, you might be surprised by it. - Mom, it's not the scenery and it's not even the people. Mom, it's my senior year. And instead of being able to enjoy it, I'm having to learn to fit in. - Wow, what a day! You know, I'm really starting to love it here. What's up with him? (knocking at door) Hey. I don't know how you ever talked me into that. I can honestly say I have never been more scared. Rock climbing was never on my bucket list. - You didn't act scared. - Yeah, well I'm pretty good at hiding it when I want to. Like now. Mike, you know life is full of unexpected twists and turns. You have a choice. We either face life's issues or we turn from them. - I just don't fit in here. (gentle piano music) (sighs) - I didn't fit in on that rock. I remember hanging on the side of that cliff thinking, what in the world am I doing up here? But, after we were finished, and I survived, it was one of the greatest memories I have. - This is different, Dad. - Really? Yeah, maybe. But, I think after all is said and done, you might find this might be the best experience in your life. All right, I'm going to go check on supper. Whatever your mom's cooking sure smells good. Hey Mike, I have faith in you. (gentle piano music) - Morning. - You're up early. - Yeah, I'm going exploring. - Exploring, where? - Mom, I'm 18 now, I can handle it. But I saw some woods down the road, it looks like a pretty good place to explore. Maybe take a few good pictures. You're the one who said to give this place a chance. - Okay. You have your cellphone with you? And do the words no trespassing mean anything to you? - I love you. - A kiss please. Be home by five. (gentle music) (camera shutter clicks) - [Mike] I've always loved the outdoors. I could spend my entire life hiking and exploring. If only I could find a way to make a living doing it. (Jasmine crying) (gentle music) - Are you okay? - Who are you? What are you doing here? This is private property. - I was just um... I'll leave. - Good idea. Hey, wait. Aren't you the new kid? - Yeah, I'm Michael. - You're that preacher's kid. - Oh man. Okay, I'm leaving. - [Jasmine] Don't tell anyone about this, okay? - Tell 'em what? - That you saw me like this. - Your secret's safe with me, so. - I'm Jasmine. - Michael. - You said that already. - Oh. (laughs) Oh yeah. So I'm guessing you own this land? - Yeah. Well, my parents do. I just come out here to think sometimes. - I can see why. You're lucky. Boyfriend. - Former. - [Mike] What happened? - He died. (intense guitar music) - Chase was your boyfriend. Oh hey, I'm real sorry. - No, it's okay. - I should go. - Yeah. See you at school. (gentle guitar music) - Oh, we're done. - Days get longer and longer. (girls laugh) - The longest day of my life. - Jasmine, hey Jasmine. - [Jasmine] Hey, I'll catch up with you guys later, okay? - [Girl] Okay, bye Jasmine. - [Jasmine] Bye. Hey. - Hey. - So, what's up? - Oh, yeah, right. I wanted to show you these photos. I took these back at your place and, I don't know, I thought you might wanna have 'em. Wait, you took these? - Yeah, but I mean, you can keep them. I mean, they're yours anyways, right? - Thanks. Hey. Do you think that you could teach me to take pictures like these? - Yeah, sure, of course. Yeah. - All right well, meet me out there later. - Okay. - Okay. - Oh hey, it would have to be after basketball practice today. - Okay. Bye. - Stupid basketball. - No. We didn't know it was coming. I don't know what we could've done differently. And I'm his mother. I should have seen something. I should have noticed. I should have been watching. I should have recognized. I should have talked to him. - This is a normal day for her. Crying, the guilt, despair. Blaming herself. By blaming me. How long does this have to go on? - There's really no timetable for grieving. Process is different for all of us. - Seems your grieving time is over. - You think this is easy on me? - You sure seem to be handling it okay. - I'm handling it in my way. - If I might. This might seem strange, but what you're experiencing is normal. - I don't care about normal. I care about my son and I want him back. - Don't forget, we have another son. And he needs his parents. (sighs) Sally, life goes on. It's been a year. - So what, we just forget about Chase? Is that what you're saying? - I never said that. We just can't grieve forever. - I can. (sighs) - Well I can't. Not and keep my sanity. (sighs) - Both of you have every right to feel the way you do. (sighs) I think it would be helpful if you incorporated some constructive things in your lives. - Like what? - Well, continuing this open dialogue. Sharing your feelings. Especially with each other. I also think it would be helpful if you were around other people who have gone through a similar experience. Maybe a part of a support group. You're both hurting. It may look different, but it's hurting, just the same. - How long before our old lives return? - Honestly, John, never. But there is a peace to be found. - [Lucas] The party and like I'm ready to leave, people are leaving and things are winding down, so I'm trying to find an exit. But I go upstairs and this girls following me. I actually go in the bedroom, she's knocking on the door, I'm not lettin' her in. There's not an exit... I thought you quit, man. - I never said that. - Well, you should've. - Look man, I don't want any trouble. - Well you're fixin' to get it. Look, hey, if you think you're gonna come in here and replace Chase, you've lost your freaking mind. - I'm not trying to replace anyone, okay, I'm just... - You just what, huh? Huh? You gonna save us all? - Green, Evans. What's going on? - Nothing coach. We were just talking basketball. You know it's a physical game, right? - Okay, listen to me. All of you listen to me. We don't have time for all of this. We play Highland tomorrow night. And if we don't get focused, the playoffs are gonna be over quick. - Coach, we can beat Highland. Even if the angel here is playing. - Enough! We have work to do. Everybody take to court. (gentle somber music) - Hey kid. Hang tough. (gentle somber music) Okay, everybody in. Everybody in. Let me have your attention. Being a part of this team is more than just basketball, practice and workouts. It's about having character. And gettin' your grades. I just got word. Wallace, you're academically ineligible against Highland. Head to the locker room. Hey. Get your grades up. We may be able to get you back I this thing. All right, guys. We're one man down. I've got faith in you guys. We can pull together. We're a team. All right. Our scouting reports say Highland is soft on the post. So that'll be our focus. That's where our points are going to come from. Okay. (whistle blows) All right, you know the drill. Hey. Keep it clean, boys. Play hard, no fouls. All right. (whistle blows) (intense music) - Come on, ball. Ball. - [Coach] Nice, nice, very nice. - You can't hold me. Not today, not ever. - Okay, turn it around. Offense goes to defense. That's the way Green! Good job, Mike, good job. Turn around. - [Lucas] Ball, ball. Ball, ball, ball. (upbeat music) (groans) - I'm not scared of you! Then you're soft and stupid. And you better stay away from Jasmine! - What? - You heard me. I said stay away from her. - You can't tell me who to hang out with. - What did you say? Say it again. - Enough! If you two have so much energy, let's run a few gassers. Everyone on the line. Green that way, Evans that way. On my whistle. (upbeat music) (whistle blows) - I was beginning to wonder. - Yeah, practice ran a little longer than I expected. - So, did you bring your camera? - Oh. I had a feeling I was forgetting something. I can bring it another day. - It's just as well. I'm not in the mood. (gentle music) - Hey, can I ask you a question? How did you get your name? - Jasmine? - Yeah. - My dad. It's his favorite flower. Before long this whole place is going to be blooming with them. It just grows wild. Kind of like me, I guess. - Yeah, I'd like to see that. The flowers, I mean, not you. (laughs) Is it okay if I ask about him? How long had you been dating? - We were an item since grade school. I really can't remember a time when we weren't together. He was my hero. - [Mike] What happened? - I've asked myself that a million times. He just started shutting me out. I should have done something. - Blaming yourself won't change what happened. There was a kid back in my junior high, that committed suicide. And I kept asking myself, what I could have done differently. You know, maybe just talk to him more or just be his friend, I don't know. You know, I had lots of guilt. But then I finally realized that, hey, it's not my fault. - What changed? - For me it was God. - God? Now you sound like the preacher at his funeral. Besides, I've tried all that God stuff. Until I found out how flawed it was. - It's not Christianity that's flawed. It's the Christians. (gentle music) I mean, we all have struggles. But God hasn't given up on you. - Where do you get all this stuff? - Well I'm a preachers kid, what do you expect? - Well, I doubt God would want anything to do with some troubled high school kid. - I don't know. You might be surprised. It's funny what we believe about ourselves and God. Regardless of how many times we hear about God loving us, it just doesn't really sink in. - [Cheerleaders] Give me a G to the O, go, go, go. Give me a G to the O, go, go, go. - Okay guys. All of your hard work has led up to this moment. This game. This is your moment. This is your gym. This is your game. And let's show them how we do it in our house. Tigers on three. One, two, three. - [All] Tigers. (upbeat music) (attendees applaud and cheer) - [Cheerleaders] Let's go, Tigers. Let's go, Tigers. Let's go, Tigers. Let's go, Tigers. (upbeat music) (crowd cheers) Let's go, Tigers. (upbeat music) - [Coach] Good job. Luke! (upbeat music) (crowd cheers) Hands up, hands up! - Tony, great job, great job. Keep up, keep up. (crowd cheers) (upbeat music) Swing the ball, swing the ball. (upbeat music) (crowd cheers) (upbeat music) (crowd cheers) (upbeat music) Great job, great job. (upbeat music) - Shoot the breeze, shoot the breeze. - Let's go now, come on. (crowd cheers) (upbeat music) - There we go, yes, yes. Yes, yes. Go, go, go. (upbeat music) (coach applauds) (crowd cheers) Good, good. - Now off rebound, be prepared. (upbeat music) (whistle blows) (upbeat music) - [Mike] Love him or hate him, you have to admit that Lucas could play basketball. I guess it's really all he has in life. It's where he's fulfilled, where he can let it all out. But on this night too much of his emotion was pouring out. Maybe it was the death of Chase, maybe it was just Lucas being Lucas. (whistle blows) - Foul! - Come on, you saw that. He's flopping. - 10. Fine, Wayne. (groans) - Green, what are you doing? You're going to get kicked out of this game. - I didn't touch the guy. The ref's an idiot. - Yeah, and you have four fouls. You're on the bench. Benson remember, you have four fouls, too. No more fouls. Evans, you're in. - Are you serious? Coach, he'll cost us the game. - Did you hear me? You're in. - I'm going in for five. - Okay guys, keep your composure. We've got to get this win. We're in total control of this game. Mike. Give me a few good minutes until Lucas can regain his composure. Okay, here we go. Tigers on three. One, two, three. - [All] Tigers. (crowd cheers) - [Cheerleaders] Defense, Tigers, defense. Defense, Tigers, defense. Defense, Tigers, defense. - No, you guys know better than that. - Rebound, come on. - [Coach Miller] Down, Spence. (crowd cheers) (mellow music) - I told you. - Inside, down low, down low, down low. Good shot, Tony, good shot, Tony. Great job. Great job. There we go. - Line, line, line. (crowd cheers) - Hey, no fouls. Come on, make smart passes, make smart passes. Smart passes. (whistle blows) - [Referee] 20. Push. - You've got to be kidding me. All right, Evans, you're back in. (intense music) (cheerleaders chatter) - Ref, time out! (whistle blows) All right guys, they're gonna try and trap to cause a turnover. We've practiced this a thousand times. Make smart passes. If we can run the clock, they will be forced to foul. - Put somebody else in the game. - What? - I said put somebody else in the game. - Green, I'll coach, you play. Now make smart plays and watch your passes. All right, Tigers on three. One, two, three. - [All] Tigers. - [Cheerleaders] Hands up. Keep them hands up, hands up. Keep them hands up, hands up. Keep them hands up, hands up. - Come on, Lucas. Lucas, down low. - Time out, time out. (whistle blows) What was that? God. - They're losing their composure. Now we gotta keep on 'em, guys. Stay in the game. - You know we're out of timeouts. Lucas, pass the ball. Mike was wide open. Mike, you get the ball... - I'm not passing the ball. - You'll do as I say or I'll put your butt on the bench, got that? We worked too hard to let this slip away. Let's go out there and get this win. Tigers on three. One, two, three. - [All] Tigers. (dramatic music) - Come on. - Now all we got to do is put 'em in the same situation. Let's go. (cheerleaders chatter) (whistle blows) (dramatic music) - One, two, three, four. - Lucas! (whistle blows) - Hold, hold, three, four, Green, push. (intense music) - Push the ball, push it. Get it up to him. Boom, that's the way to finish. That's what I'm talking about, Tony. Balls out, balls out, yes. Free ball, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Eagle, eagle, eagle, eagle, eagle, eagle. (dramatic music) (buzzer sounds) (crowd cheers) - [Mike] Yeah, love him or hate him, you have to admit that he can play basketball. And everybody loves a winner. - Sweetheart, why don't you go ahead and get ready for bed and I'll be in there in just a minute. - One day you'll realize the contributions I can make to the parenting discussions. - Hey, I think we need to talk. I'm having a really hard time watching our son be embarrassed on the basketball court in front of everyone. And please, don't give me that building character sermon again. - Quitting the team is not "building character" either. Liv, this is not as bad as you think. - Try telling that to a 18 year-old who's trying to fit in. (Alex sighs) - I hear what you're sayin'. But I just know this is gonna get better. Trust me. - This isn't a matter of trust. This is about the damage that is being done to our son's confidence. - [Faith] Mom! - Honey, I'll be right there, okay? I think you need to think this through. - Okay. - Okay. - [Alex] Hey, Mike. Great game tonight. - Seriously? Great game? I almost cost us the playoffs. - I don't know if I would say that. You scored four points. You had some big minutes. - Be real, Dad. It was horrible. I was horrible. How am I supposed to face those guys? - I know it's hard to believe but, you're going to look back on this so differently. - You keep saying that, Dad. - I remember when I was your age trying to figure out why this thing happened or that thing happened. It's frustrating. But I also remember somebody shared with me something about how God works in our life. He said it's a lot like driving a car at night. You know, you only get enough light for the road right in front of you. But it's enough light to keep you safe. And hopefully keep you out of a ditch. - And what do headlights have to do with basketball? - I don't know what the Lord's trying to teach you right now, but I do know that he is. And I also know that if you will trust him, he is gonna guide you through this. Even if it seems like you're lost in the dark. (Mike scoffs) - Well we both can agree that I'm in the dark. - Mike, you've got to remember that it's Satan whispering those lies in your head. You lose all perspective. For instance, what if you had fouled that guy at the end of the game? He goes on to make two free throws. You guys lose. On the other hand, the way you played it, you allowed Lucas to make the play. It's a team game, Mike. So I say we celebrate with one of your dad's award-winning malts. Why don't you get the blender out of the cabinet. (gentle piano music) - [Mike] I think it was then that I really appreciated my dad for who he was. Thanks, Dad. - Hey, I'm a preacher. This God stuff's all I know. Now where does your Mom keep those scoops? - I think over there. ♪ Close our eyes ♪ ♪ I see you smile and then I knew ♪ - Hey Mom, I'm going back out to those woods.

Hey, can I invite a friend? - Maybe not this time. - Come on, Mom.

Oh yeah, for sure. Look at that. Give me more fierce, if you can. Okay, okay. Give me sassy, I bet you can't. Like, give me one of these.

We're going to be late. - Well, nice to meet you, Michael. Jas, be in by 12. - We're going to be late. - Okay, okay. 12 o'clock, no later. - Okay, got it. (Mike sighs) - That went a lot better than I was expecting. (Jasmine laughs) - Yeah, I mean, my parents are pretty cool. They usually just let me do whatever I want. - Oh, speaking of parents, mine are expecting us, so, we should probably head on over. (gentle music) - Hey, I have an idea. I mean, we have this whole house to ourselves. Let's just stay here. - That's not a good idea. My mom would not be a happy camper. - Don't be such a square. I mean besides, don't your parents trust you? - Jasmine. That's exactly it, they do. I mean, doing something like this would make me lose their trust. - Square. - Come on, I met your parents. You get to meet mine. (Jasmine sighs) - Fine, okay. - Hey honey, try not to ask too many questions. Let the adults do most of the talking. - Mom, don't take this the wrong way, but have you heard how boring you and Dad are? (laughs) - Well we'll do the best we can. Michael is bringing a friend so be nice to her as well. - Mike has a girlfriend? - I said a friend. - But then you said her. - But before that I said, be nice, remember? - Yes, ma'am. - Now finish help setting the table. - Michael's got a girlfriend. Michael's got a girlfriend. - This girlfriend have a name? - Not yet, but she must be angelic, by the way he's acting. - Obviously it's Olivia. (Olivia laughs) - Flattery will get you everywhere. - Hey, I wonder how much time we have before... (doorbell rings) - [Faith] They're here. - Let your daddy get it. Remember what we said. - John and Sally, come on in. - Hey. - Good to see ya. - You, too. - Good to see ya. - This is my wife, Olivia. - So nice to meet you. - [Alex] And our daughter, Faith. - [John] Hey, nice to meet you. This is our son, Lucas. - [Mike] Hello, Lucas. Your dad's told me a lot about you. (timer beeps) - That's my roast. I'm going to go get it, excuse me. - Well, is there anything I can help you do? - [Faith] I'm coming, too. - So Lucas, that was quite a game you played the other night. Hey, and your dad says you've been getting some offers to play college ball. It's pretty exciting. - Yeah, but I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet. - Well, I'd love to hear more about it. Let's go in the living room. - Whoa, whoa, what is this? Is this some kind of sick joke? - What are you talking about? - Just take me home. - What's the matter? I thought you were all excited. - That looks like Chases parents car. - Look, I didn't know anything about this. Mom just said we were having company. - Okay, I know this is hard for you, but I don't want to go in there alone. - Okay then, let's just both go. - I can't, you know that. Please. (Jasmine sighs) - Fine. - Oh, just put that there. Thank you. Just let it cool off a little bit. - Hey mom, this is Jasmine. - Jasmine, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too, Mrs. Evans. - It's nice to see ya', Jas. - You two know each other? - Yeah, we've known each other for years. She was... She was Chase's girlfriend. - Oh, I had no idea. This is my first time meeting Jasmine. - It's okay, Olivia. It's really good to see ya', Jas. - It's good to see you, too. - Michael, have you introduced her to your father yet? - No, not yet. - Well, for goodness sakes, Jasmine. Come and meet Michael's father. In-state, maybe out-of-state schools. (mumbles) - [Olivia] Alex, this is Jasmine, Michael's friend. - Hi, Jasmine, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - Hey, Jas. What are you doing here? - Michael invited me to supper. - I think the food is ready. Why don't we go into the dining room and get ready for dinner? - [Alex] Uh, Faith, honey. Wouldn't you be more comfortable over here? - No, I think this is a good spot. - Sweetheart, why don't you come sit by me. - Well, this sure smells good. Lucas, you're really going to enjoy Olivia's roast. (intense music) - He'll eat just about anything. Isn't that right, honey? - Luke, did you hear your mother? - What's wrong with you people? Did you think I was just gonna walk in here, hold hands and have a prayer with the pastor? Was that the plan? - Lucas, sit down. - Or what, dad? You gonna send me to my room? - You're upsetting your mother, everyone here at the table. - Like I freaking care. these people invite me in, sit me across the table from that joke. And you, look at me. What are you thinking? Really, Jas. What are any of you thinking? These bunch of holier than thou Jesus freaks think they have all the answers. - Lucas Green, that's enough. - No, dad, it's not enough. Chase was enough. - Lucas. - No, I'll walk home. - Lucas, come back here. - Sally, let him go. I'm sorry. - He's a meaner. - Look, I'm sorry. - Hey, I mean, it's just Lucas blowing off steam. You get used to it. - That might take a while. - You know, the funny thing is, Chase was nothing like that. I think that's one reason Lucas' life is so out of balance, you know? Chase was always the cool one. Kind of like you. - Us cheetahs are cool like that. Hey, before you take me home, I know a great place to go. - Cool, where? - You'll just have to trust me. Turn here. - And here I thought you were gonna take me out malt or something. - Remember when you asked me to trust you? Now, it's your turn. - Okay, all right. The funny thing about trust, it's hard to earn and easy to lose. (gentle music) - [Jasmine] Just park right here. - [Mike] What's this? - [Jasmine] It's a party, silly. - I can see that, but... - It's just some kids from school. They do this every weekend. - This isn't a good idea. My dad, he... - Your dad what? He wouldn't want you hanging out with all these sinners? - That's not what I'm saying. - Hey, I've found them a lot more comfortable with these people than most of those hypocrites at church. Besides, don't be a square. (gentle music) - Just trust me. Great. No thanks. - Lighten up, everybody's doing it. - Jasmine, I don't feel too... - Hey. What do you think you're doing here? - Luke, stop. - Actually, I was just leaving. - That's a good idea. - Michael, wait. - Jasmine, would you let him go. - Let go of me. - The guy's a joke. Do you get that? - Let go of her. - [Jasmine] Hey! (Lucas yelling) - Let go of me! You're a joke! - You okay? - Yeah. Let's just go. - Okay. I'm sorry. (humming) - Wow, I've never seen you up and dressed this early on a Sunday morning. - Yeah, I told Jasmine I'd pick her up on the way. - Hey, you got a sec? - Sure. - How do you feel about last night? - What do you mean? - Well, your mom and I didn't mean to create such an uncomfortable situation. - Yeah, probably not good planning on our part. - Yeah, that wasn't our intent. It's just that I've been spending a lot of time counseling with the Greens, and as you probably know, they've been having a lot of problems with Lucas. - Yeah, them and me both. - Oh, wow. Where did you get that? - Lucas. Bumped into him last night. - Looks like more than a bump. - Yeah, so you can forget about me and him being friends. - Actually, I think you can be a really positive influence in his life. - He won't even talk to me. At least in a civilized tone. - I think you need to reach out to him. He's worth the effort. - Dad, he hates me. Don't you see that? And to be honest, the feeling's mutual. - Well, have you done anything to make him hate you? - Uh, breathe? - Well, all the better reason. Mike, he lost his brother. There's a lot of pain there. - See, but that's another thing, dad. He doesn't want me seeing Jasmine because she was Chase's girlfriend. He doesn't want to move on, and he wants no one else to move on. - Hell, I wouldn't want to move on. - [Mike] And now you're defending him. - No, I'm not defending him, just trying to understand him. For him, moving on means leaving Chase behind. He needs somebody to guide him through this transition. Mike, Jesus was pretty clear about loving people. Loving the ones that love us, that's easy, anybody can do that. It's loving the ones that hate us, now that's the real challenge. - Just great. - I take that to mean you're up for the challenge. I don't want to be late. I'll see you guys after service. - That took longer than I thought. - Yeah. - One more day, right? - Yup, see ya. - See ya. Perfect. (Lucas sighs) So, did he put you up to this? - Up to what? - What do you want? - I wanted to apologize for the other night. They didn't know. - They didn't know what? That inviting me over to dinner with a guy that I hate, and then throwing my brother's girlfriend in the mix was a bad idea? That sounds like a setup to me. - Honest, Lucas, it wasn't. I mean, that was the first time he introduced me to his parents. - Save it for someone who cares. - Look, can we just talk? - What do you want from me, Jas? - Do you ever think about him? - Everyday. - Where did we go wrong? - Wrong? We weren't there for him. - [Jasmine] Do you think we could have changed it? - What are you asking? - I don't know, I just, I know something was wrong. I could have done something. - We all could have done something! You know, that's the hard part, right? - I don't know, I don't know anything anymore. - Well, let me get it straight for you, okay? As far as I'm concerned, what happened was an accident, it was a tragic accident, and I don't want to hear you say anything different. Do you understand? - Yeah, I understand. (soft music) - I gotta go. - Lucas. We have to move on. - Move on? Move on to what? What do you want me to do? - I have to move on. I don't know if you realize this, but it's killing me. All the what ifs. Please, Lucas, just don't let this destroy you. I mean, we've been through enough already. - I'll live my life the way I choose. - He's not coming back. Ever. And there's something else. You've got to stop blaming this on Michael. - I wondered how long that would take. - He's a really nice guy if you just get to know him. - I don't want to get to know him! Do you get that? And you, what are you doing? No, really, I bet Chase would be so proud. (Jasmine crying) - I've got to move on. I've got to move on. - I have to move on too. Out of here. (engine revs) (tires squeal) - Hey, Luke. I'll be right with you, man. Awesome playoff run, man. One more and you've got this thing. - Yeah. - We just received our shipment of baseball equipment in last week. We still have some cool stuff coming in too. You moving to wood this year? You know, we have a sweet little hybrid coming in in our next shipment. With your upper body strength... - I'll take this one. Actually, I'm gonna take all those. - Okay. ♪ Everyday, I can still see your face ♪ ♪ In the pictures of the light you gave ♪ ♪ You reflected the light ♪ ♪ You shine so bright ♪ ♪ Everyday, I can still our faces ♪ ♪ In the pictures that we made ♪ ♪ We reflected the light ♪ ♪ We shined so bright ♪ ♪ That day you left me, I should have ♪ ♪ Noticed, I should have listened ♪ ♪ To what you had to say ♪ ♪ I can't remember ♪ ♪ Your sound is fading ♪ ♪ I can still see your face ♪ ♪ But I can't hear your voice anymore ♪ ♪ I can't hear your song ♪ ♪ I can't hear your voice ♪ ♪ I can't hear you shout for joy anymore ♪ ♪ I want to hear you laugh ♪ ♪ I want to hear you cry ♪ ♪ I want to hear you sing out loud once more ♪ ♪ Why did you leave me here ♪ ♪ Why did you leave me here ♪ ♪ I can still see your face ♪ ♪ I can still see your face ♪ ♪ But I can't hear your voice anymore ♪ - Honestly, it was definitely a shock to see her. But it was good, it was nice to see her again. - Please know, we had no idea. - Pastor, once thing you'll learn about this small town is, everybody knows everybody. - And that actually might be something that's gonna help you two the most. - How so? - Well, one of the things we're learning about this town is how much you care for each other. I guess it's what you call Southern hospitality. - We have felt loved. Even though it's been a very difficult year. - Well, over time, that's really gonna help. - Why did God take our son from us? - Is that really what you're thinking? - Honestly, yeah. - I've tried to tell her that's just not true. - Sally, I could give you a lot of scripture. Even clichés. The honest truth is, God loves us. - Well, excuse me if I'm not feeling the love. - [Alex] It's understandable. Ultimately, God's purpose in all of our lives is that we're learning to trust him more. I understand your feelings towards God. But better than that, he understands them. And I believe it's okay for you to tell him exactly how you feel. - Even if it's hurt? Even if it's hate? Anger? - Don't you think he already knows? I often wonder how someone with no relationship with God at all could get through such a difficult thing. Sally, trust him. He will guide you through this. - There's another issue that is... Weighing on us heavily. It's Lucas. - He's just... He's so full of anger. - How has he changed since Chase's death. - Denial mainly. Rejecting our authority in his life. Becoming distant, argumentative. Pastor, you saw him the other night at dinner. - About the only thing that he has any interest in is basketball. - That actually might be the best thing for him right now. And you know, it also gives you two a powerful tool to encourage him. - In what way? - Well, God's word tells us that we're fearfully and wonderfully made. And even when we're our most unlovable, that's still true. but when you and I see each other from that perspective, it changes the way we treat each other. And don't underestimate the power of the spoken word. Encourage him, build him up. Compliment him any chance you get. You know that old nursery rhyme? Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never harm me. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. It's the enemy that tells us we have no value, and that we're flawed. Lucas needs to know he has value. True value. In your eyes and God's. - He already has a big ego. - Sure there's a balance there, but I think he'd be shocked at how he really sees himself. - I think he knows that we love him. - He probably does. But sometimes, this might sound strange, sometimes that's not enough. Make sure you put your love into action. Can I ask you a hard question? Would you die for Lucas? - Of course. - Then let me ask you to do something even more difficult. Live for him. Lay your life down for him daily. Let him see your love for him in action, everyday. - That's actually the more difficult choice, isn't it? - Yes it is. And it's okay for him to see you struggle. Even fail. Our kids do not expect us to be perfect. They've just gotta be secure in the knowledge that we are battling with them and for them. - [Coach] That's it. Come on, box him out, swing it. Better, better. Hey, everybody in. I like what I saw today. Good hustle and good teamwork. We got Brandon back, we won three tough games without him, but Rockmore is a much bigger and more physical team. Look, guys, this is it. The championship game. What we worked for all year long. It's gonna be a challenge, but it's one we're up to, right? - [Players] Right. - All right, let's get it in. Tigers on three. One, two, three. - [All] Tigers! - All right, good job today, guys. I like what I saw, Tyler. Good job, Wallace. - [Mike] Hey, Lucas. Can I talk to you a minute? Hey, you know, we got off on the wrong foot. And I wanted to apologize if I did anything to offend you. - You want to apologize? I'll tell you what you can do. You can quit the team, stop hanging around Jasmine, move back where you came from. - Look, I know you've been through a lot. - I'll tell you what you know, you don't know anything. This is who I am, me, Lucas. I'm comfortable with it. - Lucas, listen to me, okay? - [Lucas] No, no, you listen. You come in here and try to take what's not yours, be a part of something you didn't help build, and you have the nerve to tell me you know what I'm going through? You're just like every other Bible Thumper I've ever met. You think you got all the answers? Huh? Well you can take them back where you came from. Got it? (soft guitar music) - So then Lucas grabs this guy, and he yells, don't you ever mess with my brother again. - So he was a good big brother, huh? - Yeah, yeah, he's the best. I think that's what's been hardest on him, you know? He carries a lot of guilt. So, I'm taking his brother's place on the basketball team, and his brother's girlfriend. I've definitely given him plenty of reason to hate me. - He'll come around, just give it some time. You might not believe it, but Lucas is not a bad person. - I'd hate to see your definition of a bad person. (both laughing) - So, you excited about the big game tomorrow? - Oh yeah, I'll have the best seat in the house. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means that just like the last two games, I'm probably not going to play. But I'll have a great courtside seat, and I'll get in for free, so it'll all work out. - Do you want to play? - Nah, I'm good. - Well, I think you're a really good player, and you don't give yourself enough credit. - Really? - Really. And it wouldn't surprise me if you were in the game tomorrow. - Let's hope not. - Like I said, you don't give yourself enough credit. - You see, I just call it being realistic. That's it. - Hey. I have an idea. I need to show you something. - Okay, what? - Just come on. Just come on. (soft piano music) - [Mike] Okay, where are you taking me? - [Jasmine] Just park in front of the gym. - You're gonna get us arrested. - Don't worry, my dad's on the school board. - Okay, so what do you want to show me? - Just come on. Come with me. - How did you know that would be open? - I have my ways. What? - [Mike] We gonna play basketball or something? - [Jasmine] Oh, no, no, I don't want to embarrass you, so... Remember, do you trust me? - [Mike] Yes, okay. - [Jasmine] Okay, come on. I have a little something special for you. - [Mike] Okay. - [Jasmine] Come on, you'll like it, I promise. - Where are we going? - Just follow me. (soft piano music) - This is crazy. - You're about to miss it. - All right. - [Jasmine] Come on, we're gonna miss it. - Oh my gosh, the fireworks. - This is my favorite place to watch them. - Well, yeah, it's the perfect spot. - Hey, I've got something for you. - What's this? - What does it look like, silly? - Well, I know what it is, but... - I want you to wear this while you play basketball. You know, to give you strength and courage. - Shouldn't I be the one giving you a cross? - Maybe. And you know, you're a much better player than you give yourself credit for. - How? - Well, I do. And this will remind you that I believe in you. - Thank you. Wow. (fireworks going off) Whoa. - Come on, lie down. Come on, I don't bite. Now look. - Wow. - [Jasmine] Have you ever seen anything this beautiful? - Are you talking about the stars or about the fireworks or about you? (Jasmine laughs) - Good answer. But in this case, I'm talking about the stars. Tell me, what's the first thing that comes into your mind when you look at all this. - Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens. Who created all these? He who brings out the sorry hosts one by one and calls forth each of them by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing. - Wow. I'm guessing that's from the Bible. - No, I wrote that. (both laugh) Yeah, when we lived in Colorado, my dad and I, we'd always go camping. He'd teach me the names of the stars, and he taught me that verse. - Can you teach them to me? - Sure. Okay, you see that really bright one up there? - Yeah. Wait. Let me guess. Betelgeuse. - That's a nice guess, but no. Actually, that's not even a star at all. that's Mars actually. - Hey. Sit up with me, okay? Close your eyes. No peeking. - Okay, okay. - Now, hold out your hand. - Is this another one of those trust things? - Kind of. Hold out your hand. (soft piano music) - It's my turn. - Uh-uh, you picked all last week. - It is my turn. - Hey, you two, let's get going, you're gonna be late. - Mom, tell Mike that it's my turn to pick the radio station. - You picked last time. - Meaner! - Mike, why don't you let her pick the radio station? - Mom, she listens to classical. - And Mike is going to get to pick the radio station all next week. - That's not fair. - Okay, off you two, off. Go, go, go. Mike, drive carefully, okay? - Honey, don't forget I'm gonna be late tonight, we have a deacons meeting. - Wait, before you go, I have something important to show you. I found this in Mike's pants pocket. - I could stand here and give you guys a speech about focus. About hustle. Or team work. About how the practice, hard work, and dedication comes down to one last game. One chance to do something spectacular. Something that you will cherish for a lifetime. And all that's important. I want you to focus on the moment. Enjoy it. Relish every play. In life, man, games like this, they rarely occur. This is your day. Your moment. Savor it. For yourself. For each other. All right. Bring it in. - [All] Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, forgive us our trespasses as we forgive others who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. - Amen. (cheers) - [Cheerleaders] Are. You. Ready. For. (intense music) - What do you think would happen if one of us fell off the roof? Do you think they would stop the game or would it just go on? When Chase died, it was like no one noticed. The world just went on. And they couldn't feel the pain. Because to them, it was just another day. - Lucas, they all came to see you play. - Players come. Go. Die. But the game just goes on, doesn't it? - Hey. You have a game to win. (crowd cheers) - [Cheerleaders] We are New Hope. We are New Hope. We are New Hope. - All right, this is it. What we played hard for all year. Keep your focus, and play smart ball. Tigers on three.

Before you go, you got a minute? - Sure. - Faith, honey, can you let daddy and I talk to Michael alone? Besides, it's close to your bed time. - I know, you'll be in to tuck me in. I never get to hear the good stuff. - Mike, why don't you have a seat. - What's up? - Uh, Mike, I uh... I found this in your jeans pocket. - You have some explaining to do. - It's not what it looks like. - Why was I expecting that answer? (soft music) - Jasmine. Hey. Look, I love you. And I love you too much not to treat you like how I'd want my wife to be treated. Okay? I'm not proposing or anything, I'm just saying that I... - Hey, hey. Shhh. Teach me more about the stars. - I bet your mom thinks I'm a tramp. - [Mike] Yeah. (Jasmine chuckles) - Jerk. - That's the cool thing about being a preacher's son. You can pull out the grace and forgiveness card like that. (Michael snaps fingers) - So, were you nervous? - I was scared to death. Oh my gosh, like, talking to your parents about sex is not easy. - Actually, I was talking about the basketball game and the big free throws. - Oh, yeah, then too, for sure. - Did the necklace help? - Actually it did. It reminded me of where my true strength comes from. - Why do you hang out with me? - Is that a serious question? - We're so different. - Probably not as different as you think. - Really? - [Mike] Seriously. I mean, what, you think I'm made of steel? Like I don't have my struggles? - You sure put on a good show. - It's not a show. But it's a struggle just the same. - I mean, wouldn't your parents rather you be dating Snow White? - Jas, we all have a past. And we all have our current struggles. I try to live my life honoring God. And as the saying goes, you know, Christians are not perfect. We're just forgiven. - Do you think I'm forgiven? - It's free for the asking. - And my past? - It can be just that. The past. - I want that. - All you have to do is ask. - Will you teach me to do that? - Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot easier than astronomy lessons. - Thank you. - [Mike] For what? - For being you. - [Mike] Hey, Lucas. Hey, Lucas, wait up. Hey, my dad's having a fellowship for the team at the church, you know, later on. I just wanted to invite you. Coach is going and everything, so... - A church fellowship? - Yeah, but I mean, it's a laid back get together. It's not like... - You can stop apologizing. It's all right. Look, I'll go. I just, I don't want you to think I'll be some kind of regular. - Okay, deal. - All right. Besides, God doesn't want anything to do with me. - Do you really believe that? - Man, you just don't know what all I've done. I just, no. God's not for me. - I'll tell you what, you and I will go to lunch together, and if I can't convince you otherwise, then lunch is on me. - A betting man, huh? I like that. Yeah, you got a deal. - So, how does it feel? - What going to church? - No, being state champions. - My whole life, people have told me I was dumb, I wasn't going to amount to anything. Proving them wrong felt great, you know? But I don't know, I just kind of felt empty, just, I really wish Chase could have been there. You know? - Yeah, me too. - Heck, you didn't even know him. - No, but I know best friends are hard to come by. - Yeah, Chase was the best. - Well, hey, I know you and I, I don't imagine us every being that close, but I just want to let you know, I'm not giving up on you. - Hey, Evans. Say it again. - [Mike] I really meant it when I said it. I'm not giving up on you. As crazy as it may seem, Lucas and I got past all our differences. Yeah, it took time, but it was worth it. He was worth it. And today, my life is richer because of our friendship.
