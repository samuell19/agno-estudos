Sanoop, The same thing... but if you give it, a bit more of emotion, it would sound great. The remaining, we can correct it here, right? Let's rock. Sir, one second. What's up, naughty? Dad, I want to tell you Two truths, OK, make it fast. Just Two truths, OK? You will be shocked to hear it. Tell me fast. I'll decide on whether to get shocked or not. I had a beer today. How's it? Awesome, huh? You don't have any problem with it, huh? Oh! Isn't it for Us the goverment sells it? But this time, you will get shocked for sure. OK, tell me fast. Let me get shocked. - I have a boy friend. - Really? Who is the guy? His name is Abay Stephan. Is he handsome? That's not it. He cheated on me. Awesome! Your Abay Stephan is smart, huh? Tell me more. What's it? See, I'll call you back, OK? Even otherwise, you don't have time to speak to me these days. OK then, you need not call me back. I'll call you after sometime. Now, hang up. Which brand is it? - Dad, why are you here? - Just tell me what did you just have? - You get ready fast. Let's go for an outing. - Where? Just come. Make it fast. Don't turn off the radio. Why should I stop listening to music for the problems you have with Abay Stephan? Dammit! Don't utter the name, 'Abay Stephen', here. He's an idiot. This is not what you told me until now. Then, why did you love Abay Stephen if he's an idiot? Dad, if you irritate me further, I'll stop talking to you. Is your Abay Stephan as terrible as you say? Isn't it a very silly thing, honey? What is the use of getting upset for such petty things? Look at me. Don't get emotional. Dad, a car!! Honey. Dad! What the crap are you doing? I... hm... Did you see anything? What? When the car was going to hit us? I saw the car going to hit us. What else? So, you didn't see anything else, huh? By the by, what did you see, dad? I saw my entire life. Starting from my father... What on earth! Suddenly, one Devi Bhaskar popped into my mind. Who's she? Someone similar to Abay Stephen to you. Wow! Tell me, let me know. Dammit! See this. Wow! It's a goal. Crap! "Winners rock." " Loosers shocked" "The yellow rock, just fell down, Ouch!" Oh! You reached, huh? Where were you? Oh! You're drunk, huh? I guess you have drunk more than usual. Yes, true. Since Brazil lost it, I went for a 4-5 extra shots to overcome the grief. So, this is your excuse for today. Last week, you boozed for celebrating Brazil's victory, remember? You try to make me a fool every time. Sonny, aren't you the one who belittled me in the public? Your team did not play well, and lost it. What use putting the blame upon me? Anyways, no one is gonna have a son like you who ridicules his dad in public. Dad, just accept it, if you have lost it. You don't have to drink and blame others for it. Your team has more rounds to play, right? You will feel the pain when your team looses it next time. I'll see to it. You come and eat now. It's your team that won. So you may fill your tummy. Dad, what the crap are you doing? This is Brazil's blood. Brazil's blood, it seems! Crap! Krishna. Sonny, Krishna. Don't scream. Didn't anyone teach you to take a towel with you to the bathroom? I've kept it there. Well, Krishna. I was thinking... about buying You a new bike. Just keep these tricks for yourself. I've ironed your shirt. I know you would. You are my prince. Don't try to flatter me. At least today, I need to reach school on time. C'mon, fast. Dad. I'm coming. Just a minute. This feeling of yours... to poo just before heading somewhere... It shows your lack of confidence. See, you will know how painful it is, only when you feel like pooing. Ah! Not a surprise that your tummy aches. You should think about this, when you eat full tummy of Porotta, Beef and Booze at night. But Krishna... How do you know that, I ate Porotta and Chicken yesterday? I saw you throwing up the same on bed yesterday night. Brazil's blood, it seems! Crap! Aren't you ashamed, dad? If you are a man, you will drink, and even throw up. Is it a big deal? Oh, my goodness! As if every man throws up on bed. You know, I didn't eat just because You didn't eat. Do you know, what your problem is? - You're sitting in the middle bench. - What is wrong with it? Only those who sit in the first bench is counted as studious. They are the ones who study well and get into good jobs. Backbenchers are normally naughty chaps. It's them who become famous as politicians, players and so on. - Do you understand? - What about the middle bench? Ah! Only nuts like you sit there. The first two categories of people will exploit you guys and live. That's what... You just ride fast, it's already late. I know why you changed the topic now. [Singing prayer] Don't howl, don't make noise. [Resumes singing] Devi Bhaskar! You love her. If you want her to love you back, you need to impress her. You need to have talent, if at all you want to impress her. What talent does he have? Poor guy. When you communicate through hand posters, it's called a Dance. There's an idea. Song! You should start singing. If so, you can sing along with her. You can eventually lure her. - Hey, get up. - God, I'm caught. You won't study, and you will not let others study also. If you flunk your exams, I'll show you my true colors. You just laugh like a fool for anything I say, OK? Hey, it's applicable to you as well. Buddy, I'm going to sing. Stop singing. How terrible! True. She was better than you. She will not fall for you, if you sing like this. - She will break instead. - What if I sing another song? It's better for you, if you don't sing at all. How else can you lure her? What about playing Tabla? If so, you can stand behind her. That's true. Then, you can lure her as you strike it. Your idea is fine. But my back would pain, if I sit longer. - Try Sitar, then. - Sitar? No need. You have to keep it on the shoulders... no need, you'll be bent to one side like actor, Mohanlal. C'mon, what's wrong with Mohanlal? - There's nothing wrong with him. - Then? - My shoulder will pain. - In short, you are lazy. - That's not it. - Then, you learn guitar. You just have to move your hands like this. That's true. Nice idea. Guitar. Guitar is fine. Fixed! I can teach you. What is it for? Hm... even I started it for the same purpose. - Then, what happened? - What else? She left me.

It's just a page long. - Time: 1 Hour. - Hey! Hey, fatty! - What is it? - Isn't it biology, today? - What did you ask? - Isn't it biology exam, today? - It's Malayalam, today. - Malayalam, huh? - My god! - By the by, have you studied Biology? - No. Hey, Shilpa. - What? - Will you show me? Get lost. Shh... sh... 1st question?? Shh... Sh... 2nd question?? What about the third one? - You don't know anything, huh? - No. That's OK. Take it. Open, open, open it. Sorry, I was tensed up.That is why I told your name to the teacher. That's OK. I don't have any problem, even if teacher tells my dad. My dad is cool. But it's because of me, even you couldn't write the exam. That's OK, I told you know? You don't worry, dear. Well, can I ask you a doubt? I saw you writing even after handing out the bits to me. In reality, How do you write exams? By using bits or by yourself? The thing is, I study everything. But I can use the bits, if I forget anything, right? That's what. Oh! You're pretty clever. Dad. Hey, dad. What is it, kiddo? Dad, do you know why I sit in the middle bench? Yes, of course! Because, you're block headed. Oh, that's not it, dad. If I sit there, I can easily move to front or back. Only the middle bench has such a speciality. Oh, this philosophy of yours is interesting. Who told you this? No one has to tell me. This is my own thought. Oh, is it? Why do you want to open your big mouth at this late hours? I swear, this is my own understanding of an incident that happened today. What incident? I'm never gonna say that. You will make fun of me, if I tell you. I promise, I will not humor you. You speak out. No, I'm not saying it. You will make fun of me, I know. Means, you don't trust me, right? Let it be. It's not because I don't trust you. Promise me that you wouldn't tell anyone. If so, I'll tell you. It's after saying it to her, I understood that the Middle bench has such a specialty. I could sense it from your mannerisms from these days. What's your next plan? I guess, I should reveal my love to her. I already knew that you are a stupid. This is the right chance for you to get close with her. You should try to know more about her. You should try to understand her likes. She too must feel for you. You must reveal your love only when you're very sure that she loves you too. So, shall I do this way? Yes.

You think for yourself. How did you propose to mom? I waited for her by the road side with a gift in my hands. Though nervous, I proposed to her, and gave her the gift too. Did mom beat you? No! She took it. Oh, it's very simple, huh? Yes, yes, this would appear simple to you. You can't imagine how nervous I was. You would definitely faint in such a situation. Leave it. What was the gift you gave her? Listen, you need not be poetic. Instead, tell her the matter in a simple way. Yeah, that's what girls these days like. Just go and say that you love her. Ask her to wear this and come tomorrow, if she likes you. Eh? Is it this simple? - Yes, it is. - Then, I can do it. I have something to tell you. What is it? Tell me. Where is it?

Tomorrow will do. Think properly and give me an answer. Take your time and think. Krishna. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. OK, but what gift did you give her? I... Mom's ring. Mom's ring, huh? Kiddo, we haven't even pledged it in emergency. Leave it. But why did you run from there? Shucks! You should've waited for her response. Why are you still an idiot? But you only told me that I would faint in such a situation. - That's why I ran off. - But, is it what you should do? I got nervous. My little son, Krishnanunni. Let's go for Krishnanaattam. [Temple art in Kerala] Does he understand Krishnanaattam also? Krishna. Kiddo. Tomorrow, she might say, 'yes', right? Can you please sleep now? Otherwise also, he blabs at night, just to disturb my sleep. Anyways, we will know about the ring tomorrow. Good night. Krishna. What a sleep of yours? - Aren't you getting up? - I will, don't irritate. Everyday you complaint about me getting late. Today, I'm ready. - And you are still on bed. - But it's too early. Don't you have sleep? How does a true lover be able to sleep? It's me who is in love, and not you. Dude, I'll get my ring back, right? You yourself ask her. If you can give a ring, I too can give... Shucks! I mustn't have said it. - Hey! - What? - Are you not done? - I'm coming, just a minute. What did you tell me the other day? Symptom of Lack of Confidence, Right? Tell me, who is lacking confidence now? Oh, you were waiting for your turn to belittle me, huh, dad? Didn't you understand at least now, that pooing and confidence are not related at all? I love someone else. I just wanted a studious guy around. Moreover, I love music. I even wanted a company to come back from school. I never thought you would misunderstand it. 'I'... 'I'... 'I'... Whatever you said right now... was just all about 'You'. In fact, that's not your fault. No matter how sincere you are, no one values it. Even I got a bit late to understand it.

Hey, dad. I, for some reason... didn't feel it as any exciting love story. Like how you said to Devi Bhaskar, you have only said Your perspective of the story. Everyone is like this, honey. When you're in love, you complaint for every single thing. I guess, even your problem with Abay Stephen is the same. No, it's not. Was it just a one way love? Didn't it work out? - Have you heard 'Maamool song'? - What's that? - The song, people in Kannur sing. - No. - I'll explain. Get into the car. - OK. What was it for? Why did you have me dream so much? Didn't I discourage you from this? But it was you who lured me... Krishna. I never expected that it would end like this. I have a sister too. When my parents insisted... I had to agree. I don't think I can live without you. I can't live without you. Krishna. The groom is smart. Who is he? He is my guitar teacher. Hi, Sebastien. Hi, dear. What's up? I thought you were coming tomorrow. I've not cleaned the house. Then, we will clean it together. What you say? - He's my Sam. - Hi, Sam. I've got you admission in a new school, OK? - Are you working? - No, I'm a house wife. You could've worked. Kiddo, come here. He is my son, Krishnakumar. - Hi, Sonny. - He's an engineering student. - Oh, is it? Which year? - Final year, I think. Tomorrow, there is a function here, conducted by our association. I can introduce everyone to you when you come. OK, fine. So, let's go inside. I'll join you in sometime. OK, we'll just start anyways. - OK. - Come, kiddo.

You killed it, man. You have a future. Bro, can you teach me guitar? Why not? I'll come to your house and teach you. - Sonny, can you teach him? - Of course! Sebastien, it's true that he plays guitar well. But Anand, his guitar tutor is a better choice for teaching. - I can introduce you to him. - But he is living far away. At Chenkunnu. Its just a 15 kms away from here. Is it a short distance for you? Do you want to travel 15 long kms after school and hectic tutions everyday? That too carrying those heavy school bag and guitar with you? - You want it? - No. Thus he will get tired, and would start to hate guitar. I'll never allow it. That's fine. You yourself can teach him. - What fee do you charge? - No need. Knowledge increases when shared. That's what my dad says. When will you be coming? I'll come tomorrow itself. Tomorrow is a good day. Yes. Let's start, then? - Happy? - See you. OK, dude. - See you, tomorrow. - Good night. You were asked to come at 4 o'clock, right? Isn't it the first class? Why delaying it? School bus comes only at 3.30. That's OK. I'll wait. - That won't be good. - No, it's not a problem for me. We can spend time sharing jokes and stuffs. That's a problem for me. You wait and see. She will definitely open the door that was shut against me. She will run after me. Otherwise, I'll make her run. Yes, she will run. Just wait for it. What did they teach from school today? Today, maths teacher taught me decimals. Could you learn it properly? Not fully, it was a bit tough. OK, take off your clothes. I saw Sam coming in. Shall I start the class? Let's start the class? Watch me do this. There are 6 strings. This is a guitar's head. Look at this. You hold this. I'll show you. Nowadays, you get free-bees for anything you buy. Do you want to learn guitar too? I can teach you, if you wish. See, your son! There's a strike in the school. I was there. So, I took him along with me, since I didn't want to delay our class. Oh, it's you, huh? Come on in. Come, dear. Oh, were you eating? I can come after sometime. You should eat with me today. Come, sit. - Diana, get him a plate. - OK. Well, how's the guitar classes going on? Is he doing well? Good. He's talented. That's not a surprise, dude. When I was in college, I forgot... what's that instrument? Er... - On which we beat like this...? - Is it Chenda? Not Chenda, it's Drums! Drums! I was an expert in it. Back then, it was not at all a career. So, I just left it. But now, it's a top profession. - Yes, yes. - It's money, too. Why aren't you eating? Eat. The tea is not hot anymore. Just heat it. - You want tea? Just drink. - No, I don't want. - Just drink. - No, no. - Diana, get him a cup of tea. Though it doesn't have a carrier, I can help if you want. Really? My hubby is down. - Why don't you ask him? - Oh, my goodness! No need. She opened the door that was shut against me. Now on, just watch. She will run after me. True! Hope she doesn't fall anywhere. You know what? If you are serious about what we discussed just now, I am willing to come. Hello. Shucks! She left, huh? Well buddy, did you ever meet her again? My studies got over, and I got into a job too. After that, I took my parents and relatives with me to her house with a marriage proposal. A government job was not at all exciting for them. They were looking for NRI's. They wanted to make their daughter a nurse, and send her abroad. We tried our best to convince them about the security, a government job would offer. Just that she cried a lot... and I created problems... Finally, I lost her. But if you had married her back then, you would've had a son as big as Krishnan. That's true. But now, when I get back home after a long day of work and tension, Sam comes chuckling and giggling. He talks to me, and plays with me. When I hear all of them... that keeps me motivated to move ahead in live. How's Krishnan? We are like friends too. But he doesn't like me drinking. Oh, would he complaint that that I had you drink? No, he won't. He knows that I drink occasionally. Isn't he around 22? Now, it's time we fix drinks for him. That's what our forefathers have told us. I'm a bit tensed about him. What happened? His age!! What else? Nothing wrong is gonna happen. Our kids, right? They won't do anything wrong. You see for yourself. Where on earth is she going to? To see him, where else? She came here recently. She is close with Krishna, it seems. Even I heard the same from Sushama. Hey, just see Krishna's new set up. She is gorgeous. That's why he isn't stepping back from this. She is going to see him. Ah! Brother. - Where were you? How long have I been waiting for you? Let's start the class. - Why no mind? - Krishna, you leave. What's wrong? Why do you loaf around here all the time? There're rumors outside. Let them say. Why getting worried? - Can't we just ignore it? - You can ignore it, that's your age. That's not the case with me. - Stop the classes until I say. - Don't leave like that... Krishna. Hey, Krishna. Aren't you listening to me? Yes, I'm. Why aren't you going there to teach him guitar? I'm asking you. I don't feel like... Sonny, isn't he my friend? Won't he think bad about you? Let him think whatever he wants. Why should I bother? Even otherwise, you abandon things halfway. You didn't complete your studies. Oh! You'd better build upon it. What else should I say? You only agreed to teach him, right? Otherwise, they would've found someone else. Can you just leave me alone? Always irritating!! Mom. Why isn't Krishnan not coming here to teach me guitar? He will come. He might be busy. He didn't talk to me when I just met him. Why is it so? Is it because I didn't learn my lessons well? Why are you getting upset? Krishnan will definitely come back to teach you. Please sleep now. Krishna, I want to talk. No need. You needn't trigger rumors. Are you not afraid now? Sam is upset because you're not coming these days. It's his birthday tomorrow. He will be happy if you come. You should come. - Diana, how long have you been here? - What? - I mean in Kannur? - 3 months. - OK, have you visited places over here? - What? Have you been to Muzhippilangadu beach? No. Have you eaten those yummy Mussels from Ondele? - No. - Have you enjoyed the breeze blowing at Dharmadam Island? OK, I'll come for the party. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you, dear Sam. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to Sam. Please keep it inside. Did you eat, kiddo? Have it. Just smile, kiddo. Diana. Where are you? - What is it, hubby? - Why is it lying like this? Clean it. My head is aching. I'll do it in the morning. Ants will come, if it is kept open until morning. You just have to brush it away with a broom. Not a big deal, right? Clean it, right now. You blame me for anything and everything I do. I'm working here from dawn to dusk. But I bare all the blames. I have never had a word of love from you. And never understands anything, even after saying it. Told you that I'm not well, and will clean it tomorrow. Why the hell are you screaming for just asking you to clean it up? I didn't say that I wouldn't do it. Instead, do it in the morning. - I'm working here... - Just stop, will you? Even I come back home after working a day long from office. What do you think I am doing here a day long? I didn't say anything. Hubby, our son is sleeping. Lower your voice. Did he sleep? Yes. Did kiddo sleep? Finally, you came, huh? Why the hell did you come here at this late hours? Didn't I tell you earlier, to come here in time? Do you know how long has he been waiting for you? I invited you here, just to see his happiness. Why did you come here after everything is over? Today is Sunday, right? I couldn't get this anywhere here. I had to go to Mangalore to buy this.

Same thing, only that I went to the extreme of it. It was a kind of too extreme!! I have seen this in many films. I myself can narrate the flashback, if you want. OK, go on. So, a famous restaurant in Goa. You sing beautifully. But anyone barely listens to you. So, you go for another track. You are enjoying your life in Goa.

That day, you performed the Purple Haze in Old Goa, right? - Yeah. - You are a good artist. - Thank you. - I'm Vrinda, from Pune. I'm Krish, from Kerala. Oh! Puttum Kadalem [Speaks in Malayalam] - You speak Malayalam? - Yes, a little. - Your Malayalam is very cute. - Really?? Well, I didn't see you in the Old Goa restaurant again. Why? - I'm not playing there anymore. - Then? I'm playing at Bhaga, Las Olas. - If you're performing Jimi Hendrix's song, I'll come. - Yes, Of course. Sure? Cool. OK, then, see you. See you there.

Sorry, you got it wrong here. That's not what happened. Then? What was it? - What happened? - Nothing. Open up. Yesterday, we didn't have protection, right? So, a bit tensed. Do you know the happiest day ever for a woman? No. To get a child from her most loved man. But unfortunately, I can't be that happy. I'm infertile. - Chill. Shall we go? - Yes. Come, let's go. 'No commitements', that's how we started our relationship. But later, it was me who wanted some sort of commitment in our relationship. Hey. - What's it? - What plans for tomorrow? Tomorrow? Nothing. Is so, can you come to Papachole's tomorrow? - What happened? - I wanna tell you something. Why your face look cheesy? I'll say it tomorrow. Vrinda. Vrinda, just stop. Vrinda. Vrinda, what happened to you? When did I show commitment towards you? - Vrinda, I thought like... - You thought! You thought it, and believed it. Never felt like asking me, huh? What are you saying? I can't understand. We... we had good time together. But that doesn't mean that... we are committed. Even otherwise, when did you start loving me? Did I ever tell you that I loved you? - Shucks! - Then, how did you see me? Don't misunderstand people, please. And what about the things happened between us? - It's just sex for you? - It's not about sex, yaar. It's about enjoying your life. Don't be an idiot, please. Yes, I'm the idiot. For you, this is just an enjoyment. I think you will never understand. I have seen many girls in my life. What do you think of me? That I'll be terrible if you go? It's over, Krish. It's the punishment given by god, for what you had done to Diana long back. So, is she the last one from the long list of Krishna's lovers? Yes. But the love story is not over. How come a love story without a lover? This is the love story of the girl, I loved the most. Tell me, fast. Next, you're going to watch a stunning performance by Sajesh Kannadiparambu. Buddies, I've written a poem for you, to get rid of your boredom. Here it is. Laila cuts the Aila. (Mackerel) The Aila is being cut by Laila. [Sings a funny poem] Why are they getting late? I don't know. You sing along. Hurray! The booze is here. I'll rock it today. - Get me the mike. - Is it chicken? - I'll sing next. - No, please. Hand me the mike. - Keep the mike beyond his reach. - Haven't you seen singers? Tell me the truth. Have you ever practiced singing in life? Why are you loosing your temper unnecessarily? - Temper, huh? - Krishna, tell him how good I sing? Take it easy, dear. - Your voice makes people's ears bleed. - Whose ears? All the chickens at Kozhikkayam ran away, it seems. It's not chicken, but your mother-in-law who ran away. He is jealous. Shh... sh... Wife is calling. - Hello, aren't you coming home? - Yes, sweety. Where are you? Drinking with friends, huh? I know you. It's for boozing, you go there. - I'll come now. - I've known you for years. You may sleep there itself. Your stupid friends won't have to go home. I'm going to my house. You need not come. - Please, just listen. - You stay with those scumbags. I wonder when did I feel like marrying this bitch? 11.55. - I have written a song about her. - No, we don't want to hear. - Listen to it. - No need. ♪ It's dirt! It's dirt! ♪ ♪ Human beings are made out of dirt. ♪ ♪ You are just a woman. A silly woman. ♪ ♪ You are my headache. ♪ ♪ Ever since I married you, my life became handicapped. ♪ Buddy, Do you think you will throw up? Dear Krishna, the thing is... I think, I must stop singing. Stop singing, huh? Why do you feel so? My voice isn't good, right? Who told you that your voice isn't good? They are simply making fun of me. Is it why you want to stop singing? Ask them to mind their own business. This is the business they do; Gosipping! Have you heard of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan? - Who's he? - You haven't heard of him? - No. - Leave it, what about Elvis Presley? - No. No...? Seriously? C'mon man! Do you know Jassie Gift, at least? Yeah! [Singing Jassie Gift's song] Enough, enough. They too are singers like you who weren't liked by any. - Really? - I swear. But later, the entire world accepted their voice. That's what... One day, even your voice will be accepted by the world. - Let's wait and see. - You needn't laugh. That day, I will lift you up on my shoulders and ride you this way. You wait and see. That's it. OK, you get down. We're here at your house. Well, don't stop singing, OK? Why aren't you getting down from the bike? Dear, I am trying, but not able to... - Why? - Somebody has tied me up. Just a moment. Oh, you had locked me up, huh? Slowly. Guitar! Give me my guitar back. It's my life. Guitar... here it is. - Don't drop it on the floor. - Hold it. You get going. Mom's alone at home, right? Watch your way and go. Well, let me tell you something. It's just because you guys keep supporting me, I am getting spoiled. Get home, fast. - You honk the horn, first. - Yes, it's done. You leave. Mom. I am going, bye. Mom, dear mom... - Don't throw up there, OK? - Mom... You didn't sleep yet?

Kuttan, why are you always finding fault with us? We come wagging our tails, thinking party would save us in danger. But you upset us. I didn't tell you that I wouldn't help. - Let me try calling him. - You can do it, Kuttan. Hey, hey, can you please come here? I'm at my workplace. What's it, Kuttan? Why don't you hire Mohan's son and singer, Sajesh? You know them, right? They don't show up regularly. Then, how will I...? - Did you take money from my purse? - Yes. My goodness! It was kept aside for buying medicines. I'll buy it on the way back from work. Do you even know what medicine it is? I've spoken to him. Just go and meet him. That-a-boy! Lovely Kuttan! - You needn't flatter me. - Did you feel so? - Now on, don't come up to me for such things. - Never again. - OK, Kuttan. - See you. From today, it's just home and work. - What about beverage? - Then, how about taking a leave today? - No way, I must work today. - Then, let's plan for tomorrow. Buddy, how is this?

The talented singers don't have enough opportunities here. The thing is no body values us. I'm planning to fly to Gulf. There is no use of being here. Are you coming too? No, you will have to work there. Terrible! Hey chap, I'm not sending my son to Gulf. We grew him as a singer. He will sing in TV one day. - You heard it? - This is reason why he is a getting spoiled. Rameshan, you'd better settle your pending bills and leave. Or else, I'll drive you away. - I love you, mom. - Like mom, like son. Nothing is working out. It's recession, right? Yeah, they are sending people back. Even my job is at stake. Rogue! He is the rascal who created a scene at the theater. Get the vehicle. He thrashed my wife. Ride fast. Stop there, idiot! Stop, I say. Dammit! I still can't get out of my anger. Hey! Ride closer to him. Let's see how far you will go. Hey, make it fast. - Stop there, son of a dog. - I can't be happy before I hit him. What have you thought of yourself? - Stop there! - Ride fast. Damn! Stop the bike. Stop, I say. Son of a bitch, stop the bike. Shucks! No matter what, I must thrash him today. - Ride fast, we can catch him at the junction.- Oh, My god! - Daddy... - It's Mom, honey... Daddy. - Hello. - Buddy, did you give your bike to Sajesh? - Yes, what happened? - Where are you? At home? - He fell down from the bike. - When? - Half an hour ago, it seems. - From where? - At the junction. - You saw him...? No, I just heard of it. I'm on the way. - Where did you reach? - I'm just here, get out. - Where? - Here I'm. - Get on, let's go to the hospital. - What is it? - Any problem, tell me. - You get on, first. - Just tell me. - I will, wait. Kuttan. - How is he? - Critical, it seems. Krishna, please get inside. - Hold him. - All of you, please move aside. I think I must stop singing. Stop singing? Why all of a sudden? My voice isn't good, right? One day, even your voice will be accepted by the world. That day, I will lift you up on my shoulders and ride you through this way. You wait and see. Be careful. Please lift up the portion towards the head. He mustn't live happily after killing one among us. So, all set. - Don't you want to go out? - Yes. - Nithula, the auto will come now. - Yes, I'm ready. Did he tell you that he won't turn up yesterday? Dad, you know it, he doesn't tell me anything. You ordered two cups of tea, right? What else do you want? Will you give us every single thing we ask for? Hey, do you have anything really hot? Son of a dog! You dared to kill our pal, huh? I didn't do anything wrong. Who are you guys? Don't let him escape. Catch him. Don't let him go. Somebody help! They are killing me. Chop him off! Don't let the pig escape. Son of a dog. I haven't done anything to him. It's true that we followed him. But the reality is, he fell down from the vehicle by himself. - Lie down there, scumbag. - Please don't do it. Didn't I tell you what happened? We will not let you walk with these legs of yours, after killing one of our closest friends. Oh, my god!! Nithula went to her house taking your kid. She said, she will not come back. A mother is a mother. A father can never make up for her absence. Krishna, I realized it a bit late. We might not find love when we really long for it. But you could show some maturity when somebody loved you back. If so, she wouldn't have left you. At least from now, try to live as a good human being. Why did you ask me here? Kuttan. How long should I have to live here in the jail? You should've given it a thought before you did it. It was just in the heat of the moment... My bad. We feel terrible here. Somehow, help us to get out. Elections are coming up. So, it will be a bit difficult. Don't worry, let me try. Kuttan, first time you're asking for a help. So, how can I say no to it? But one condition; he and his friend shouldn't create new problems after they get out. - Agreed? - Yes, sure. Did you get inside and see him? Come. Bruno, you are already here, huh? Kuttan, Navas, everyone is here, huh? Pal, did you see him? Come inside. - Get me the glasses. - Tea... - Please serve tea to everyone. - Yes, we will do it, you go. It might rain. Many people have come. We will take care of everything. You leave. I know that I don't even have the right to beg pardon to you. Still, please give me one more chance. Back then, when I longed for love, no body cared to love me. But when somebody loved me back, I couldn't realize it also. 'I'... 'I' didn't... 'I' didn't realize it. 'I' didn't know it. I, I, I... 'I' is the main problem between us. If you want to understand it, we need to find out, how much we belong to each other. I was sure that you will understand it one day, and come back to me. And I had waited for it, for long. But when I saw you the other day, I realized that you were far different from what I thought you were. If you had taken care of Sajesh's family instead of settling scores for his death, I would have been proud of you. If at all I feel you are valuable... And if I need you, then, I will come back to you myself. Every Radha would have a more tragic story than Krishna. This is the best love story, dad. But... I never thought she would leave you. What a strong woman she is! Well, dad. Among all your lovers, who do you love the most? I will tell you. Open the gate first. Dad, life is so complicated, right? Not at all, my dear. But the climax of certain love stories are a bit complicated. They are unpredictable. If you want to see the strongest woman who I loved the most... just get inside. She is there. This is my story. Even you will have stories. If you want to see the strongest woman ever you just have to go home. She will be there. BEEP.
