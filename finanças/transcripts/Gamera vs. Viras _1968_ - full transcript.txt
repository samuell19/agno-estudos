A DAIEI CORPORATION PRODUCTION Attention all spaceship crew members. Attention all spaceship crew members. Our radar screen has picked up the target we've been seeking for such a long time. Activate the radar screen! This is it. This is our target of attack. The planet most similar to ours in all the universe. The earth! This planet's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen and 18% nitrogen. Among its other properties are argon and carbon dioxide. It is endowed with all of the elements essential to our survival. Our mission is to occupy the earth and colonize it with our own species. We will soon approach the earth and commence an immediate attack. What's wrong? Activate the radar screen! What is that image?! Is that image from the earth? It is our enemy. That creature is our enemy. Commence the attack! Put out its jets! Extinguish them now! Switch to the emergency flight plan! Jettison the compartment that the creature destroyed! Cut it loose! To our mother star, Viras... Our ship's most important mission has failed. Dispatch Spaceship #2 immediately! We have discovered a terrible creature protecting the earth. Its name is...

Welcome back! What a fine camp. Yes, the boys were able to get this all together thanks to your generosity in letting them visit your lab for free. No, no. It was nothing at all. Time for roll call! Quiet! Huh? What? What is it? It's time for roll call! We can't be late! That's not my hat! Sorry. Where's my hat? Hurry! Where did Masao go? Don't worry. He's learned his lesson. He won't be late again. Hey, hey, hey Have you seen Masao? He was playing with Jim over there. I see. Hey, hey, hey is Jim around? He's not here. Have you seen Masao? They're still not here, are they? Well? What's the head count? 115 members in all. 113 are accounted for. The other two have gone off somewhere... What? Two are missing? It's those two again, isn't it? Yes. Those two. INTERNATIONAL OCEAN RESEARCH LABORATORY Masao! There it is! Let's go check it out. All right. Maintenance is all done! They left. Let's go! Doesn't look like much, huh? This thing looks like a kid's toy. A toy for grown ups. They'd never let us try it out. Want to take a look? Okay! Wow! This is great! How cool! Masao, how about we give them a surprise? Okay! Just leave it to me. Hmm... Where's the battery? Here it is! What are you doing? I'm switching the plus and minus. If I interchange them, it'll reverse the controls. You mean they'll try to go forward and they'll go back? Right. They'll have no idea what's going on! Awesome! Those two always get into trouble when they're left alone. Go look for them. Scoutmaster, there's no need for that. Masao's sister can contact them now. Contact them? Yes. Just a moment. I've got it. Masao is 48 degrees east. That's about 200 meters from here. Wouldn't that mean he's in the laboratory? This should do it! Aw, man. I have a call. This is Masao. Over. Masao? Darn! It's her! Masao, you're late for roll call. I'm cutting your dinner portion in half! We gotta hurry! Jim! What's wrong? Look! Okay! Okay! Thank you. Today, we're visiting the International Ocean Research Lab... and thanks to the generosity of Dr. Doby, you'll all be able to ride in the lab's submarine! This device is so simple to operate... That even a child can drive it. But Mr. Shimada and I will go first to show you how it works. Here, Doctor. Awe, man... Masao... This is bad, isn't it? What did you guys do? Oh, no. Nothing. Nothing at all. Push those buttons on either side. These? That's right. There are many beautiful sights under the sea. Huh? Yes... Very nice. Well then, let's proceed. Dr. Doby, when you said "Proceed," did you mean "Go in reverse?" No... This is odd! Well, let's reverse. Doctor, we're going forward... This isn't supposed to happen! Are you all right, Doctor? We're going down! Are you all right? Boys, due to some odd circumstances, we'll have to postpone your rides. Hey, Scoutmaster! The submarine is fine. Dr. Doby just can't operate it. Masao! That's silly. No, I bet Masao could operate it much better! You boys are messing around again, aren't you. No. I'm sure I can do it. Let me try! Please! Doctor, what should we do? No... The submarine isn't functioning properly. It's not a good idea. Come on. We can repair it. Masao! We can't risk it. Doctor... Masao is very good at tinkering around with machines. He designed this gadget here. Then they made it at his father's factory. Doctor Dobi, he's really a boy genius with machines. But he's even better at playing pranks! What? It's true! All right. Climb aboard. Okaaaay! Okaaaay! Don't go too far. Yes, Sir. Good luck! Give it all ya got! They'll be headed for the end of the earth, for sure. Don't worry! Don't worry! So... To go forward, we push the Back button. Hurry! Come on! Hey Sis, we're going down now. We're 50 meters down. Everything is working. We're going southward now. We'll return in about 10 minutes. Don't go too far, now! Okay, okay! I can't believe it. It's a miracle! Push the button on the side. Wow! This is great! Attention all spaceship crew members. Attention all spaceship crew members. We must not let Spaceship greatest sacrifice be in vain. Activate the radar screen! In order to capture the Earth, we must eliminate Gamera first. Therefore, Gamera is now our prime target. We must find out where he is. Wow... Masao, we're getting pretty far out, aren't we? Don't worry. Leave it to me! Masao, what's that?! That thing over there! It's a monster! Ah, it's just Gamera! Masao, let's go! It's all right. Gamera is a friend to all children. Are you sure? We'll be fine. You can take his picture if you want. I wonder where they are now. Probably at the end of the earth! Hey Sis, guess what? Gamera's right alongside us! Gamera?! Yeah. We're having a race. Masao! Masao! Masao? Yes, this is Masao. Over! If you're making this Gamera business up, you'll have no dinner tonight! Scoutmaster, we're not fibbing. Jim is taking pictures of him right now. We'll show them to you later. He's huge, huh?! Masao, Gamera is walking around on all fours! All right. We're going to try to drive this thing under Gamera. Here we go! Attention all spaceship crew members. Attention all spaceship crew members. Look! It's Gamera. We have located Gamera. Commence the attack! Fire the Super Catch Ray! Masao, what's up? Hello? Hello? This is Masao. This is Masao! Sis! Sis! It's no use. The frequency is jammed or something. Jim, Gamera is caught in this ray. It seems like he can't move. So what's going to happen to us? We're running low on oxygen! Gamera, help us! If we don't get out of here soon, we're gonna die! Now! Let's go! Okay! Back button! The Super Catch Ray will only be able to hold him for another 15 minutes. We must use the time we have left to find out how to capture Gamera and make him our slave. Therefore... We shall now explore his memory waves with our Videotron so we can investigate his past. First, we shall see how Gamera was born. We will study his powers so we can find his weaknesses. HIGHLAND PARK Gamera is a formidable force with great destructive power. His one weakness is his unusual and over powering kindness to human children. Oh, no! The Super Catch Ray has lost its power! Commence the attack on Gamera at once! It's true! Gamera helped us! This picture will prove it. Jim, what happened? I messed up. It's dark down there and I didn't have a flash. Jim... There's nothing here! You two are quite good at making up stories, aren't you? Scoutmaster! What's that? What is that thing? What is that? It's Gamera! Gamera! Gamera! Wait up! Go get the boys. Everyone go back! Doctor, please lead them back. Okay! Gamera! Gamera! Gamera! Gamera! Prepare the brainwave decryption device! Attention Gamera! Attention Gamera! If you attack our spaceship, we will kill those two boys! Miss Nakatani, where are the boys? Over there! I shall repeat. If you attack our spaceship... We will kill those two boys! Masao! Masao! Attention Gamera! Attention Gamera! We have taken the two boys hostage. You shall obey our commands... Or we will kill them! Masao! Masao! Miss Nakatani, it's too dangerous. Get back to the laboratory! Hurry! Masao! Masao! Gamera! Touch down! Obey our commands or we will kill the two boys! Gamera! Touch down! All evacuated, Sir! What happened to Masao? Miss Nakatani... Don't worry. I'll think of a way to rescue the boys. You'll help, too! Yes, Sir. Doctor! Gamera... It's Gamera! Look out! It's the spaceship! Masao and Jim are inside that ship! Please, save them! Jim! Jim! Let's go! What's with these guys? The people here sure are weird. Let's go! You guys were captured just like us, huh? Let's escape together! That's so cool! Let's give it a try! Owe! Ouch! That really freakin' hurt... Guess it doesn't work for kids. They make all the good stuff for grown ups! Nothing we can do. Let's go. What's going on? Are we trapped? Don't worry. It's just an automatic door. See? And now... We begin our attack on Gamera! Prepare the brainwave control device! Activate the radar screen! Get ready to activate the laser beam! Laser beam standing by! Fire! He seems to be weakening. Prepare to fire the brainwave control device! Standing by! Fire! We did it! A direct hit! Now we can freely control Gamera's brain waves. He must now obey our commands. Let's test it out. Activate the brainwave control device! Gamera! Obey us at once! Take off! Gamera! Obey us at once! Fly! Fly! It's working! Gamera! Fly around the spaceship! Do it! Turn om the radar screen! This isn't good! Gamera's under their control. He'll do only what they say. If they were to use him for evil... We have to do something right away! Yeah. Let's take a look around the ship. Hurry! No matter where you go, there's nothing there! I'm getting thirsty. We didn't eat any lunch today! I sure am hungry! Even just a glass of juice would do. Look! What's that? It looks like fruit juice. Is it Okay, Masao? It's better than the juice in Japan! Damn it! We said we wanted some juice... And it came out of this wall. We should've said sandwiches. I've got it! Jim, this ship operates on telepathy. You just think about what you want to do... And the ship's controls make it happen through telekinesis. Well, then... I want a parachute to get us out of here! I want a weapon to blast those guys! Children, this ship's telepathic control device has a safety system. If you think of anything that would be dangerous to the ship... It won't be carried out in any way! You two are very valuable to us for controlling Gamera. You will have complete freedom within our ship... As long as you do not try to escape or harm us. Have I made myself clear? Wait! You're wasting your time! You're Japanese, aren't you? Or are you from another planet like Earth? They aren't from Earth. They look Japanese, but they're not. If they capture the Earth, it'll be big trouble for us all. We know we can have anything we want, as long as it's not dangerous to the ship. There must be some way to stop them! I've got it! I want to eat some fruit. Fruit! Fruit! Masao, what are you saying? This is no time for fruit! It'll give me a knife to cut the fruit with. You get it? A knife? I get it. I'm hungry, too. Give me an apple! Make sure it's not peeled. And don't forget the knife! Awe, man... Masao, something's going on! Let's go to the next room! Someone's coming! There's no one here. How weird! It's pitch dark in here. It must be empty. Where'd he put that thing he was carrying? What kind of room is this anyway? It doesn't look like the control room or a mess hall. Hey! Jim, have you seen my hat? Nope! There it is! That sure is weird. There's no breeze in here, but my hat flew off. Jim, do you smell something fishy? Not really. Look out! Run! What the heck is that thing? Some kind of monster. A space monster! I bet they caught him and took him prisoner, just like us. I wonder if they caught him as a specimen. Maybe they'll put him in a zoo or circus? After that, they'll dissect him... and see what he's made of. Poor guy. Let's set him free! Don't be stupid, Jim! If you came across a lion that someone caught, would you set it free? You wouldn't, right? For all we know, this monster might be like a lion from Africa! So you think they're going to take us somewhere and... Masao! The monster nodded his head! Wow! He must understand what we're saying! If we free him, he might help us get out of here! Let's do it! Jim, look at this. There's no lock or handle on this cage! I know! It must open by telepathy. That's strange, though. We're doing something that might harm the ship. But the alarm isn't sounding! It must be a gentle monster. Even if we let him out, he won't hurt anything. The guy from earlier is coming back! Jim, let's take care of him? How? Leave it to me! Come on! We'll come back and free you when we have a chance! He's coming! Get your lasso! Go! What are you two doing? You think you can take us to your zoo? No way! Dangerous actions are prohibited. You are no longer permitted to move freely. Shit... Gamera! Destroy the Okumusashi Dam! Alert the army! Gamera, your next target is Tokyo! Destroy Tokyo! Destroy Tokyo! What's that noise? Ah! It's a call from my sister! This is Masao. Over! Masao! Is it you? It's me. Thank goodness! You're still alive! Sis, don't worry. I'm doing fine. Masao, Gamera is wreaking havoc! Just as I thought... Gamera's being brainwashed. The spaceship crew are directing his thoughts! Is there any way you two can escape? No. We're being held prisoner. What's worse, they've pinned us up against the wall. Don't give up! Use the same nerve you used playing your pranks! Okay! We'll think of something! Someone's coming! I'll get in touch again later! Masao, what's that thing he put in there? It must be the monster's space food. Space food? Boy, I wish I'd eaten more of those sandwiches. I'm so hungry... Gamera! Tear it down! Level the place! Attack Tokyo Tower! Knock it down! Gamera! Destroy the Tokyo Bay Fuel Depot! Masao, what're we gonna do? We can't do anything if we're stuck here! Wait! Jim, do you still have your rope? See if you can raise it up here. Why? Just leave it to me. Attention Earthlings! Attention Earthlings! We have Gamera under our control. Until you surrender, we'll order him to continue his attacks. If you've had enough of this destruction, surrender immediately! If you resist, we cannot guarantee the lives of the two boys on our spaceship. Gamera's destructive path is now spreading across the entire country. There's no telling what else he will destroy. Unfortunately, none of our weapons appear strong enough to defeat him. General! We've switched on the emergency power! Our one target for counter attack is the spaceship controlling Gamera's actions. But those two boys are still being held hostage on board the ship. General! Masao's father and Jim's parents have arrived. Bring them in. Father! General! Isn't there a way you can rescue Masao? Please save Jim! I understand how you must feel. But at the present time, we have no way to rescue them. We must make one of two choices. The first is to accept their demands and surrender the earth to their power. The second is to sacrifice the lives of Masao and Jim for the freedom of eveyone on earth... and attack the spaceship. General, which of the two options will you choose? All of earth is concerned in this decision. The United Nations has called an emergency meeting at their headquarters in New York. We'll receive their decision soon. We're just waiting for their phone call. Mariko, Masao still has his wrist radio, doesn't he? Yes. But when the ship's too far away, I can't get through to him. Damn. I see what you're saying... Doctor, how much longer? Ten more minutes. Mr. Nakatani, please wait ten more minutes. We're increasing the transmission range so we can reach Masao's wrist radio. Please do everything you can. Jim, straighten yourself up as much as possible. Are your feet clear? All right, duck down and try to slip out of these bands. Okay, I'm free! All right. Now it's my turn. Mr. Shimada! We've made contact! Ah, my sister's calling us! This is Masao. This is Masao! Masao! Masao, it seems that the earth is deciding whether to surrender... Or to attack the ship you're on. Sis, please tell this to everyone. We'll sacrifice ourselves. Please attack the ship. Mama... Papa... Please tell everyone. Go ahead and attack the ship. Everyone, we've received the decision from the United Nations headquarters. We can't sacrifice those two boys. Humanity is going to surrender. Sis, what's wrong? Why is everyone so quiet? Sis, what is it? What happened? Masao, the Earth has decided to surrender! No! We don't care about ourselves. Please, attack the spaceship! Masao, this is a decision from the United Nations headquarters. We have no other choice! Is there no other way? Masao, Jim, I checked the engine of the submarine you took out. I saw that you tampered with the battery coil and made the engine go in reverse. You two really... Mr. Shimada! This is no time to scold them about a stupid prank! Wait. That prank might be able to save the Earth. Listen, you need to do something to reverse the device that's controlling Gamera! Switch up the control device? Of course! If we switch the battery coil, it'll reverse the current! Then the commands Gamera's getting will be reversed, too! We understand, Scoutmaster! We'll give it a shot! We're counting on you! The earth has surrendered. The first phase of our mission is complete! Now we can begin Phase Two with no resistance... and attack the earth! We Virases are the greatest species in the universe! All other species are useless! Gamera, annihilate the Earthlings! Destroy them all! Oh, shiiiit... Oh, shiiiit... Let's go! Help! The monster's loose! Now! The control device! Switch these two. Now let's see what happens. All right! It worked! We've got one more to do! Let's go! Strange...Those kids were lying, weren't they? Where's the Super Catch Ray firing device? Let's change these two around. Leave it to me! All right! Masao! It's all right. Fire the Super Catch Ray! Over there! Masao! It worked perfectly! The ray usually moves things up into the ship. But since we reversed the current... It beamed us back down to earth! That prank really saved us! It's the spaceship! Run! Those kids! How did they escape? We'll make Gamera attack them! Order Gamera to kill them! Gamera! Touch down! Touch down! Gamera, attack those two boys! Kill them! Gamera! What are you doing? Can't you hear? Kill those two boys! It's no use. Run! All right, Gamera! Boss! This is the only safe room left! Please, save us! We beg you! Please save us! This is the only room left! We have to hide here! Boss, please let us stay here! We beg you! Activate the transmitter! To our mother star, Viras... We cannot capture the earth unless we kill Gamera first. Spaceship #2 is now switching to emergency flight. Gamera! The spaceship's getting away! Gamera's brainwave control device was smashed. Then it's over! Jim, let's check out their spaceship. Okay! We are down to our last resort. I shall kill Gamera no matter what happens now. To do this, I must have all of your lives! But, Boss! I get it now! Those humans were caught by the Super Catch Ray, just like us. The monsters hid themselves in their bodies to pose as humans. They wore their bodies just like suits. Run! Look out! Gamera! Use your fire attack! Gamera! Nice shot! Cool! Gamera! Get closer! Gamera! Gamera! Gamera! Gamera! Gamera! Gamera! Gamera, it's coming at you! Go, Gamera! Gamera! Gamera, use your jets! Gamera, what's going on? Go, Gamera! Go! That's the last we'll see of Viras! All right! Gamera won! Masao! Sis! Nice work, Boys. You put your pranks to good use for once. But for your practical jokes, no dinner for you two tonight! Nice work, Jim! It's Gamera! Goodbye! Goodbye, Gamera! Goodbye! Thank you, Gamera! Goodbye! THE END
