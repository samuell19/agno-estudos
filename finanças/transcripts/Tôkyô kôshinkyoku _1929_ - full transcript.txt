Well, I'll serve him anyway!" "Yoshiki, I adore that new geisha!" The old Fujimoto has also fallen under the spell of Orie. "My little Orie darling!" "I don't want your gifts! Let me go!"

"For his happiness, I'd consent to it... but it's impossible..." "If that ring you're wearing was given to you by your mother... well, Orie... you are my daughter!" "I'll marry Orie, even if I have to fight against my whole family!" "Father, what is she doing here?" "Yoshiki, Orie is your sister!!" At Sakuma's place... Dear Sakuma, I will never marry Orie.
