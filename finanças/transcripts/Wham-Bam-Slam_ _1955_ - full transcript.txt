[♪♪♪] Good morning, Petunia. Good morning. Where's my wife? Oh, she went shopping with Larry's wife. How's Shemp feeling? Not so good. He had a bad night. Oh, that's a shame. Ah! Nice hotcakes. Mm. Yummy, yummy. A little butter. Ah. Ooh, some syrup. Well, well, ketchup, my favorite fruit. [CHUCKLES] Ooh, mustard! My lucky day. [CHUCKLES] What's that, whipped cream? Oh! If I only had some beer. Beer with hotcakes? It's delicious. [CHUCKLES] Say, you know it's funny. None of the doctors seem to be able to help Shemp. My friend Claude could cure Shemp like nothing. He can do anything. While we were in school, he cured all the pupils there. What school? The reform school. Look, let me show you. I got his card right here. Listen to me, will you, Moe? Look. [MOE READS CARD ALOUD] You see? Let me go get him. He'll cure Shemp like that. Are you sure? I'm positive. Only fools are positive. Are you sure? I'm positive. Oh. Get out of here! Moe. Yes. Shemp has got to eat something. Will you cook this hotcake while I go and get him? Sure. Hurry back. [SPITS] I have no appetite. You eat at least two of those or I'll never speak to you again. Okay, but no syrup. Okay, no syrup. You know, these hotcakes are delicious this morning. They sure are. They're as light as a feather. Thank you, dear. I didn't think I'd be hungry today. But I sure am. I told you so. That's a nice boy. Chew it all up good. [GULPS] [GASPING] [HICCUPS] You know, Shemp, Larry is bringing his friend Claude over here to cure you. What do you say to that? [COUGHING] Oh. [COUGHING] Oh. Oh, Shemp! [GRUNTING] [BOTH GASP] Tell me. How is he, Claude? I gave him one of these sleeping pills about 10 minutes ago. That's the best thing in the world for him, rest and sleep. But don't you think we ought to call a doctor? Why throw money away? I can take care of Shemp better than any doctor. Sure he can. Just follow the directions till I get back. I'm gonna get my doctor book. We'll have Shemp as good as new. Sure. "Take one pill, wait 15 minutes, then take a second pill." It's time for the second pill. Fifteen minutes. Right, let's go. Now don't worry about everything. Everything will be all-- Oh! Now don't worry. [SHEMP SNORING] Shh, shh. Aw, he's sleepin' like a baby. It's a shame to disturb him. Yeah, but he's gotta take his second pill so he can sleep. Maybe you got something there. Okay, kid, we-- Come on. Come on, Shemp. Come on, come on. Get up. You gotta take a pill. What, again? Yeah, again. Here. Come on. Down the hatch. Now let me get back in bed-- Oh, not so fast. You gotta follow instructions. Now that you've taken the pill, you gotta skip an hour. Get him the rope. Here, take that. Now skip! Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Here, one in each hand. [GROANS] Start skippin'. That's that. No, no. We'll let you know when the hour's up. Go ahead. Continue. [SHEMP GRUNTING] [MOE & LARRY SIGH] [BOTH SNORING] Well, that's that. BOTH: Skip! Cut it out, fellas. You'll wake me up. [GRUNTING] [SNORING] Heep-eep-eep... Hey! [STOOGES GASP] What, what, what? What's the big idea? He's following the instructions on the bottle. Yeah, it says "Take two pills, and skip an hour." You dopes. That means to wait an hour before you give him his next pill. Now he tells us. I've got my doctor book right here. I'll have his case diagnosed in nothing flat. You sit right down there. [YAWNS] Aha. Oh-ho! Oh-ho! What is it, doc? Nothing. He's got a rash. It tells you right here, a rash may be caused by excessive use of the gray matter of the brain. Oh, it must be something else. Sure. It can't be that. It also says a rash may be caused by a bad tooth. You got something there. Let's have a look. [GRUNTING] Well, none of them came out. Yet. Here, open wide. [GROANS] [GROANS] [SCREAMING] Aha! That's the one! Are you tellin' me. Get me a piece of strong string. Yeah. What you gonna do, doc? I'm gonna pull that bad tooth. Is it gonna hurt? No, I don't think so. Here's the string. Tie a nice sailor's knot. Uh-huh. Got it around? Yeah. Fine. Follow me. [SHEMP MUMBLING] [SHEMP GRUNTING] Sit down. All set? [GRUNTS] [GROANS] Aah! [GROANING] Easy, kid. Quiet. Larry, untie that line. We'll do it the old, reliable way. Come on. [SHEMP GRUNTING] All right. Now take it easy, kid. We'll have that thing out before you can say "Ticonderoga." If you can say "Ticonderoga." Back up just a little bit. Okay, sonny boy? Mm. Mm-hm. All right. Ready, hup! [GRUNTS] [GROANING] Oh, what a tooth. No wonder it was killin' me. You nitwit! That's the doorknob! Oh, yeah? Come on! Oh! Why, you imbecile. All we're tryin' to do is give you a hand here so you can get out of-- [SHEMP GRUNTING] What's the matter? I'm dead! I'm tired! He shot me! Get a doctor! Do something! Oh, quiet, pickle-puss. All he did was pull your tooth. Is that all? Thanks, I feel like a million bucks. Easy. You'll soon be a well man, especially if you go away for a couple of weeks. Yeah, we'll go-- Wait a minute. We haven't got a car. Ah, you lucky people! I've got a car. It isn't exactly brand new, but it's in perfect condition. How much? I'll let you steal it from me for 900 bucks. We'll take it! Fine. I'll have it here in the morning. And to show you I'm a right guy, I'll let you have my camping outfit. I'll bring it over tonight. That's what you call a real pal. Yeah, we can camp near a lake and catch all the fish we can eat. You know, fish is great brain food. You know, you should fish for a whale. Get out of here. Hey, Larry, Shemp passed out. Get some water. No, champagne. Come on. Shemp! Shemp! Hey, Shemp! He's out cold. Run and ask Claude what we should do. Poor kid, I'd better open his clothes. Give him a little air. How do you like that? A bulletproof vest. Be ready in a jiffy, Shemp. And tomorrow we're taking you on a nice camping trip. Oh, live lobsters. Yummy, yum, yum. Tomorrow, we'll sure have a feast. [CHUCKLES] Hurry up, Larry. His veins are getting tight. Comin' up. Claude says this'll be good to quiet your nerves. Yeah? [WHIMPERING] It's cold! Aah! It's cold. It's cold. Oh, you sissy, get in there. [LOBSTER BITES] Ow! Ow! Let go! Something's got me! [YELLING] Oh, oh! Let go! An octopus got me! An octopus! How'd you get in there? Come here. [YELLING] Out of my way. I'll mash him like an eggshell. Put your foot down, Shemp. That a boy. Hold still now. Oh. Oh! Ouch! Oh, my poor, dear, sweet loveable toe! [GROANING] [BOTH HUMMING] [MOE HUMMING] Hey, Moe. What? Don't you think we ought to practice puttin' this tent up before we leave? I think you got something there, porcupine. Let's ask Claude how to do it. Nonsense. I know all about tents. Let's go. Okay. MOE: Spread it right out flat, boys. All right. That's it. That side, that goes over... SHEMP: I used to be a Boy Scout. LARRY: Yeah. Raise that pole! Lift that tent! Further! Further! [GRUNTS] Oh, a wise guy. [GRUNTS] Remind me to murder you later. Get it up, boy. All right. Give me the other pole, Shemp. All right. I'll give it to you. Right under my arm here. Right under the arm, I'll get it. Right up here. Watch your arm. How was that? Pretty good. All right. Narcissus! NARCISSUS: Yes? MOE: Up! Hold this pole. All right, tie it off, dummy! SHEMP: All right, I'll tie it off. [CHUCKLES] [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] Next time you come in, knock first and then don't come in! And furthermore, I'll tell you-- [GRUNTS] Honey, what are you doin' under there? Oof! Say, he's my brother! Yeah? Well, he's my husband. Oof! Wait a minute. He's my husband. Oof! Girls, girls-- [GRUNTS] What are you playin' around about? Come on, get this tent up. Come on, pull her up. [BACKFIRING] Oh, boy, a super-deluxe special. Yeah, and all trimmed with chromomium. Well, boys, there she is! Yeah, but what is it? A Columbus. Never mind who you bought it from. What make is that? I told you, a Columbus. I thought he came over in a boat. Ha-ha! Don't you worry about a thing. Well, I gotta get breakfast. See you before you take off. All right, fellas, let's get loaded. Wait a minute, you know I don't drink. Go on, muscle bound! Go on! Hurry up. We gotta get started. Oh! Why-- Oh! Hey, fellas. Yeah? Come here. SHEMP: He must've found the road map. Yeah, what is it? What are you tryin' to do, ruin the baggage? [HISSING] What are you hissin' me for? I'm not hissin' you. But it's not a bad idea. Why... [HISSING CONTINUES] How do you like that? A flat tire. Get the jack and take the wheel off. I'll get the spare. All right. Here you are. Here. [GRUNTS] Hm, stubborn, eh? Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. Oh! Oh! Careful, would you? Hey, quit monkeyin' around, you guys. Here we go. Careful. There! [CHUCKLES] What'll we do now? I wonder how they got the tire on. [SIGHS] What seems to be the trouble? We can't get the tire past the jack. Why, you nitwits. Get up out of there. You wanna get hurt? Let a man do it that knows how. You gotta use your brain. All you do is give it one quick jerk. Oh! Oh, my foot! My foot is cut off! Help! Oh, oh! All right. Wait a minute. That's it! Help me! Take it easy. Get it out! Push him toward me. All right. Is it out yet? Is it out? No. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Here, I'll chop it out. Yeah. Wait a minute! What's the matter with you? We'll get you out. MOE: Get me out! Oh, my foot! SHEMP: Hold steady, will you? I'll get you. [ALL GRUNTING] MOE: Look in these shoes for some toes. SHEMP: How was it, pretty heavy? Quiet! Ooh! MOE: Guess you'll have to climb, kid. Okay, come on before the sun goes down. SHEMP: Go ahead. MOE: Oh, what fun, boys. Look out for your hand there. Give her the gun, Moe. We're off! ALL: Bye! [ENGINE GROANS] [WOMEN SCREAMING] LARRY: Help, help! Help, fellas! MOE: You girls get out of the way. I'll get him up. [LARRY SIGHS] You and your pal Claude. Yeah, he gypped us out of our dough and we're taking it out of your hide. Wait! Wait, hold it. The excitement cured me. I feel fine. Oh, we're sorry, Larry. We apologize. Oh, that's all right, fellas, you're-- [MOE & SHEMP GRUNTING] Huh? Oh! Oh! [♪♪♪]
