(air whooshing) - I can see you out in your garden, with some old book or another, wearing that big straw hat, summer dress. (sighs) Breeze blowing the flowers around you. I'm sure they all miss you in the Book Club. I haven't been reading. I know you're angry about that, but I just can't seem to get on with it. (air whooshing) (insects chirping) (Henry blows a kiss) (flute playing) (bell tolling) (gentle music) (indistinct chattering) (gentle music) (glass shattering) (paint can spraying) (footsteps plodding) - Breath. (Henry inhales and exhales deeply) I haven't seen you in town much lately. - Don't go in much. - Folks have been asking about you. - Appreciate that. - Well, I think you're gonna be fine. - Just a virus. - It isn't the virus I'm worried about. She's been gone for three months, Henry. - I know when she died, Lee. I know the very day she got sick. I know every minute we ever spent together. - You know, you need to find a reason to get up in the morning. - Dorothy was my reason. (bell ringing) - We are not going to bring criminal charges, that's the first thing you should know. But defacing school property is a serious offense. And as this is Danny's third major disciplinary infraction already this year, we're going to deal with this in a serious way. You're suspended through December, Danny. Between now and then, you can finish your assignments at home. - Whose home do you mean, my mom's or my dad's? (phone ringing) - And this is the addition itself right here, of course. It's roughly 1200 square feet. And we feel that it ties in very nicely to both the filling and the style of the old building. Mike, where have you been? Come with me, Charlie. - Sorry, I'm late. Mike, Charlie Redden, Chairman of the Building Finance Committee. Charlie, this is Mike Potter, my Project Manager for Washington. - It's nice to meet you. - Same here. - Take a walk with us, Mike. (indistinct) Getting ready for brick, Charlie. He hasn't delivered any. - Carl, we hired Mr. Cobb, to keep the historical aspect of the school, of all the schools, intact. He made all the brick when they were rebuilt back in the '50s. - Construction has changed since he first started making brick, it moves at a much faster pace and- - He made the brick for 15 of our bank branches. - If Mr. Cobb does not get us brick, you're looking at some very serious cost overruns. Douglass Construction will not be liable. You hired him. - What do you recommend? - I own a brick factory in Middleton. We can get you the brick without any problem. - What is the longest that we can wait for Mr. Cobb? - November 30th. After that, you're in trouble. - Mike will take care of it, Charlie. No problem. (birds chirping) (gentle somber music) (door thuds) (footsteps plodding) (tap metal clattering) (water pattering) (gentle somber music) (water pattering) (mule whickers) (chicken clucking) (truck approaches) (truck door thuds) - Can I help you? - You are Henry Cobb? - I am. - Mike Potter, the Project Manager of the Washington School. I have something for you. - Could you hold this for me, please. - It's a Letter of Assignment. It release you from your School District contract and assigns that contract to Douglass Brick Company in Middleton. If you sign this it means you won't be liable for damages and cost overruns, and I'll get the school built on time. - Yes, you can. - Here's a pen. - I wanna read the letter again. - Go ahead. - Tonight. - Fine. Bring it to me in the, over at the school, in the morning. (footsteps plodding) I'll be there, first thing. (car honking) (indistinct chattering) (truck door thuds) - Hello, Henry. - How are you, Ruth Anne? - Just fine. What can I get you? - I think Irises, today. - She loved Irises. - Yes, she did. - 35 years in the Book Club together, you don't forget things like that. - No you don't. (paper rustling) - You must be right in the middle of making the brick for her school. - I'm not working anymore, Ruth Anne. - I wanna show you something. (gentle music) That's your all brick there, Henry. That building at end of the block, church, at the end of the street, and us just standing right outside my store, which happens to be made of Cobb brick too. Henry, you built this town up. Made the brick in your own backyard out of Springfield clay. Now who's gonna do that for us, if you don't? - They stopped making the Model T, new cars came along. New car makers. That's what you call progress. - You're the last brickmaker in America, Henry. When you stop, we lose a whole lot more than just brick. (gentle wistful music) - The Washington School was rebuilt in 1955, with Mr. Cobb's brick. That was also the year that the new librarian showed up, with her own special box of books, that she said, everybody was going to have to read. - And everybody read them too. (faculty members laughing) - And what we all want to say to you, Dorothy, is the library won't be the same without you. (faculty members clapping) - Thank you. Thank you. Washington means the world to me. You all mean the world to me. I love this school, and all of you, more than you'll ever know. As sad as it makes me to leave you, it also fills my heart with joy, to know that I'm going home to the one man I love more than ever, my Henry. (Dorothy blows a kiss) (bell tolling) (audience clapping) (indistinct) - Mr. Potter. - Mr. Cobb, did you bring the letter? - I'm not going to sign it. - What are you talking about? You have to sign it. - I don't think I do. - 22,000 brick in eight weeks, you can't possibly do that. - I know how many brick I can make, Mr. Potter. - But you're all alone, you have no help. I mean, how old are you? - 76 - You're supposed to retire. - I will, as soon as I build this library for my wife. - Mr. Cobb, we can make 22,000 brick, in a day. - Yes, you can. You can make them faster and cheaper, but I can make them slower and better. (car honking) (indistinct chattering) (shovel digging) (gentle music) - It's dirt. - It's clay, actually. Shale. - What are you doing with it? - Seeing if it wants to make a brick. (Danny chuckles) (shovel digs) - Look here, see it's not too fat not too thin. (shovel digging) - It's just dirt. - If it's too fat, there's not enough sand, too much clay. It'll fire up fast faster, but brick will be smaller, and it will crack on you. Now what if it's too thin? (shovel digging) - Too much sand? - Yes. Can't get fire hot enough to make it hold. But this clay wants to be a brick. Mix it with some Sutter's Grove, maybe a little Warren Quarry, fire it up, turn deep red, that's the iron in it. And it ring when it cools. - What makes you think I care? - You're a boy in a ditch, playing with dirt. I know about dirt. You come to my house, you'll see what I do when I play with it. (gentle music) (shovel digging) (gentle music) (truck door thuds) (bright energetic music) (mule whickers) (bright energetic music) (water pattering) (bright energetic music) (mule whickers) (bright energetic music) (mule whickers) (bright energetic music) (Danny approaches on a bicycle) (mule whickers) Shouldn't you be in school? - I got kicked out. (mule whickers) (chicken clucking) So this is how you make brick? - Thousands of years. - Yeah, right, thousands. There's a 4000-year-old brick on display in Cairo. It's from a temple in Ur, that's a city in ancient Babylonia. The temple was built by King Shulgi, about 2100BC. There's an inscription on a brick, it reads, Shulgi, The Mighty Man, King of Ur, King of Sumer and Akkad, built Eharasag, his beloved house. 4000 years (sighs) By any count, that's an old brick. You wanna do something 4000 years old? Come. (gentle music) Take it slow. Take it slow. Slide, go in right there, right there. There you go, slip it over. Good (chuckles) Egyptians, made some pyramids of brick, turned them out in the sun to dry, same as you just did. (bright energetic music) - Can I do it again? - It's up to you. Good. Disparage me not, by comparing me with pyramids built of stone. I am as superior to them as Ammon is superior to Duggan. I was constructed of brick, made from mud, which adhered to the bottom of the lake. Egyptian brickmaker put that on a pyramid brick. - You're Henry Cobb. - I am. - I'm Danny Potter. These are the bricks for Washington, right? The new library. - It was my wife's school. She was a librarian there for many years. - That's why I got kicked out. - She would have been sad to hear that. - My dad works for Douglass. He's the foreman on that job. - I recognize the last name. - He doesn't want you to make the brick, doesn't think you can. - Told me so. (Danny sighs) - How many do you have to make? - 22,000 by the end of November. - Can you do it? - When I had three men working, I could make four, five thousand a day. But they took other jobs when I shut down the yard. By myself, I just might. If the weather holds, green brick won't stand the rain. - What happens to them? - What happens to a sandcastle when the tide comes in? - It melts. (car approaching) (car door thuds) (footsteps plodding) - What you doing here? - Nothing. - You came here instead of the job? Get on your bike and go to your mother's. (footsteps plodding) And you had better be buried in books when she gets home. You knew he's my son? - Yes, I did. - You know he was suspended? He's supposed to be working for me. - I told him - Get going. - He's gonna make the brick. He used to make 5000 a day. And he knows way more about brick than you do. - I don't wanna say it again. - I was helping him. He was teaching me how to make them. - I told you to get on the damn bike. - I will not allow this behavior on my land. Not from you, Danny, or from you, Mr. Potter. - Now. (Danny leaves on his bike) I brought the letter I want you to sign, we'll buy you out. 60 cents on the dollar, and you stop right now. - I'm not gonna stop. - We're prepared to go as high as 70 cents, and that's without you delivering a single brick. - That's a generous offer, but no, thank you. - Mr. Cobb, is just you and a mule. How in the world are you gonna mold, dry and fire all that brick, in eight weeks? - One at a time, Mr. Potter. One brick at a time. (car approaching) (door knocking) - Where is he? - Upstairs. - Danny, come down here. Did he tell you what happened? - Mh-hmm. - And? - And what, Mike? - You don't think we should deal with it? - Yes. I think we should deal with it. I just don't see why it couldn't wait until tomorrow. I had to leave the rehearsal- - That's right. You're busy. I forgot. No. That I forgot, you're busy. School, choir, rehearsal, lessons. - Oh, yes. I now have a life. - I have a life too. - Oh, congratulations. We both have a life. (dog barks) I'm not doing this again. - You brought it up. - All I did, was go back to school. - No. That's all you said you're going to do. What you did is much more than that. - We have to talk about what happened. - We told you the rules. You work for me in the morning, you study in the afternoon. And so the first thing you do is disregard that and go to that brickmaker's house. - Danny, you have to change your behavior. - Is that so hard to understand? - No. - Then why don't you listen to us? - Why don't you listen to Henry? - He is not going to deliver that brick. And when he doesn't, I'm gonna spend half my day with a lawyer, trying to untangle the mess he left behind. And none of that has anything to do with you. - You were wrong to go there. - I can go wherever I want. - No. As a matter of fact, you can't. You're grounded. No phone, no friends, no TV. - This isn't your house anymore. You don't even live here. (footsteps plodding) - You stay away from that brickmaker. (door thuds) There's no way he can make it, Carl. - I want to be sure. This Job is only 22,000 bricks, Mike, the rest of the schools were a lot bigger. One of them gets a new gym, doubling the size of the one. And adds up, to over 350,000 brick. And that's your raise we talked about right there. (truck approaching) (door thuds) - (sighs) I can't live with my mom anymore, and I can't live with my dad either. - So (sighs) where are you gonna live? - Here, with you. - I see. - I'll run away again. - That's not an apology. - I'm not sorry. - Danny, we had no idea where you were. - Danny, we were worried about you. - I can take care of myself. - You're 13 years old. - I'm not going home with you. - On the one hand (chuckles) this isn't any of my business. - You got that right. - On the other, you're all in my living room, so maybe it does concern me now. By the way, I want you to know, it's all right if Danny stays here, a few nights. It's your parents decision, Danny. But it's fine with me. (soft music) (indistinct chattering) (footsteps plodding) (door thuds) (footsteps plodding) (door thuds) - I just wanna grab him, put him in the car. - Oh, Mike, that will just embarrass- - I don't care. - Well, you should care. - Yeah. You're just this big rock of caring. - This is why our marriage ended, because you cannot talk to me without this resentment drowning every word I- - Our marriage ended because you left. - I didn't leave. - A common night course, it turned into graduate school. A part time job becomes two, two full time jobs. You walked away. - You went to work for Douglass and everything changed. - Yeah. That's right. That's right. New house, new car, money for Danny's college. - You changed. (owl hooting) I had to do something with my life. - Yeah, well, you did. (insects chirping) (owl hooting) - We should let Danny stay here. Maybe it'll be good for him then. - He's an old brickmaker. - He's a legend. His wife was a librarian. When I went to Washington, everyone loved her. (insects chirping) (owl hooting) - The second this doesn't work, he's out of here. (footsteps plodding) (Karen sighs deeply) (chicken clucking) (rooster crowing) (Danny yawns) - Good morning? - Good morning. (kitchenware clattering) - If you're gonna live here, you're gonna help me in the yard, that sound fair? - Yeah. - You gonna keep up with your schoolwork too. - Okay. - Those are fresh eggs. - What time is it? - Half past five. - I heard the roosters. - They do love the morning. - What time did you get up? - I woke them. (rooster crowing) Pour in half bucket now. (mule whickers) (water pattering) That's good. Few more days, those beds will be filled four and a half 1000 bricks. We'll have full stack in the shed too. - How do you know when the move them? - If you do a thing for 60 years you learn a thing or two about it. - 60? - If you don't count the years I worked for Mr. Hedgecock. - Who is he? - Springfield brickmaker. Old as me, when I started with him (chuckles) Paid me two dollars a day to work in his brickyard. - Two dollars? - That was 1936. - Then what? - That was the year Mr. Hedgecock got himself a new mill. Practically threw this one away for firewood. I was living here at the time, I was just goat shed back then. Well, I'd saved up some money to buy it, so I took the mill, fixed it up and started making brick. - You had your own business? Your own house? You were still a kid. - 16. Yes, I was. - Cool. (Henry laughs) - It wasn't because of me, it was all Dorothy's doing. I'd met her at church that winter. she was born a year after me, but we were born to be together (sighs) She's the one who told me to take Mr. Hedgecock's mill and start making bricks for myself (sighs) She said, if I made them right and sold them at a fair price, people would buy from me same as they would from anybody else. And they did, for 60 years. She was always right about things like that. - So I'm helping you. - If you stop talking. (soft music) (chicken clucking) - We agreed to a couple of days. - (sighs) I'm staying. - Well, you can't live here. - Yes, I can. As long as I needed to. That's what Henry said. It's okay with him. - Yeah, well, it's not okay with me. - It's not about you. - Danny. - I don't wanna go back and forth, like you're practicing how to be, when you get divorced. - You know, you're not the one who decides what happens in this family. - You're not the one in the middle. (footsteps plodding) - He's writing a term paper and I, I didn't even ask what it was about. - The Revolutionary War - I could never get him to study like that. Well, especially in the last few years. Are you sure that it's all right if he stays? - Yeah. - You know, it's just a rough, rough time for Danny with me and Mike, you know. Just a hard time for us. Just can't seem to, I don't know, connect. Can't seem to get through. - I think all husbands and wives have tough times to get through. May be different from you and Mr. Potter, but tough times still. - Maybe one day you could just tell me how you got through. (Karen chuckles) (chicken clucking) (footsteps plodding) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (Henry coughs) (wind whistling) - Danny, wake up. Wake up. We've got to move. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering heavily) Take it. Take it. (Danny falls) You all right? (Danny sighs) Okay. (thunder rumbling) Take this, take the end. Take the end. (storm grows heavier) Pin it down. Hold it. Hold it down. Grab that side, Danny. (indistinct) - I'm trying. (indistinct) (Danny falls) - Oh! Oh! (groans) (gentle somber music) (rain pattering heavily) (both sighing heavily) (thunder rumbling) (birds chirping) (rooster crowing) (items clattering) (clock ticking) - What are you doing? - Making brick. - We can't do it now. There isn't enough time. - Take that bucket and start washing down the sand beds. - (sighs) We don't have a chance. It's crazy to try. - It's Dorothy's school. - Where do you want it, Mike? - I think we have room for it right through here. Just bring it in and put it in on that far side there. (truck approaching) (indistinct chattering) (truck door thuds) (indistinct chattering) (footsteps plodding) (door thuds) - I lost more than 4500 brick, that's four days work. I know you had rain too, your foundations are full of mud. - We'll clean it up. - Mr. Potter, I'm asking you for a few extra days. - You're under contract. You signed for that delivery date. I can't help you. - I understand. Thank you, anyway. - We used to fly planes together. I used to meet him in the park after work. He would run all the way across the field to see me. - He doesn't like it that you moved out of the house. - He tells you about that? - Yeah. - I was a contractor. I worked for myself. But Carl offered me more money than I ever made to be one of his project managers. Big jobs, some were across the state, took a lot of time. Then Karen got busy. (soft somber music) But we both agreed that I should move out. Both of us, it was not just me. - And it certainly wasn't Danny. (door creaks) (door thuds) (soft somber music) - What did he say? - He said, no. - He is such a... Oh, I can't stand him. - You too hard on him. - Well, he's hard on me, and he's hard on you. - He's caught between his life and the man he works for, that's not an easy place to be. - Yeah, well, you could stick up for him if you want to, but I won't. He's going to- - He's going to be your father for the rest of your life. You did this? (sighs) Why would a boy as bright and thoughtful as you do something so hurtful? - I was mad. - At the school? - At my parents. - Then why didn't you spray paint them? Washington is a wonderful school, Danny. So many children have studied there. What I would have given to go to a school as fine as that. - Oh, where did you go? - I never did. My mother taught me to read. My father put me to work. Oh, I wanted to go. I wanted to know everything. I wanted to be with other children in a classroom, learning everything there was to learn. But before I knew it (sighs) I was on my own, working, married. Dorothy bringing me books to read. Hemingway, Dreiser, Ellison and Baldwin, I read them all. I read them all. We read them together. - I wish I could have met her. - Danny Potter, this is my wife, Mrs. Henry Cobb. Dorothy, this is the boy I told you about, living at the house, helping me to make the brick for your new library. - Henry, she's not really here. - Yeah, she is. - You don't see her do you? - No. Don't see her. - Well, that's good, because if you saw her... (Henry chuckles) - If I saw her... - But you talk to her. - You talk to somebody every day for 60 years, you don't stop just because they die. (soft somber music) - So now what? - We do the best we can. - We won't make it. There was just enough time and then we lost all those days and dad said, no. The best we can won't matter. - That's all we have left. (choir singing) - You know, I have to admit, that sounds pretty good. (bell rings) Oh, Superintendent Harris, has asked us to add a few more songs to the graduation program- - [Choir members] Oh! - To compliment people. Check your folders, the new music is in them. It's Sunrise Sunset, Climb Every Mountain and Impossible Dream from Man of La Mancha. That means, more rehearsal. - [Choir members] Oh! - New schedules are in your folders too. I'll see you tomorrow. (footsteps plodding) (indistinct chattering) (Karen humming) Hey, stranger. - Hi. - How you doing? - I'm okay. - Yeah. Staying busy? - Yeah. Henry is teaching me how to cook, chicken and dumplings are my specialty (chuckles) - Sounds good. - (sighs) Do you remember that storm we had last week? It just came out of nowhere. - It was something, that woke me up. - Yeah, me too. We lost a lot of brick that night. - Oh Danny, I'm sorry. - Henry asked dad for a few more days. Dad said, no. (both sigh) We're not gonna make it, mom. We're working as hard as we can, but it's just too much. We need help. And I want you to help us. - Did, did you hear what I just- - Longer program, Man of La Mancha. - Just means that I have less time right now not more. You know, you're asking me to go back to Superintendent Harris, and tell him that I can't keep my commitment. That instead of extending the program, I'm gonna go and make brick for Henry Cobb. - And me, Henry and me. I've never asked you for anything more important than this. I need your help. - I can't do it. (soft somber music) (Danny sighs) Oh! (footsteps plodding) Danny, don't walk away from me like that. - You said, no. - Danny, people say no, that's, its life. Not everything you want happens the way you want it to. - And I don't expect everything to happen the way I want it to. But I can want one thing to happen. That's not a lot. - And this, this is your one thing? Mr. Cobb's brick. - No. It's not. - Then what? - That you'd say, yes. (indistinct chattering) (Danny leaves on his bike) - A lot of work just to make a brick. - It's worth it. There are only two building materials that can't be destroyed by weather, fire or termites, and that's stone and brick. - You're a smart boy. How come you know so much about making brick? - Well, you do something for 60 years, you, you learn a thing or two about it. - Hi. I spoke to Superintendent Harris, and I told him, I wouldn't be able to add any more songs to the graduation program. That's gonna leave my afternoons free and I was wondering if I could help. (Danny claps) - What do you think? (Danny sighs) (bright energetic music) - Okay. - Right. We go. Just slip it over. Ready? - Uh-huh. Oh! (both chuckle) - that's it. (bright energetic music) (indistinct chattering) - Oh, right. Right here. (bright energetic music) (indistinct chattering) - Yeah. - We light a fire in each eye, then push the fire towards the center until all the arches are burning end to the other. (tap metal clattering) (water pattering) - You can wash up here, change back to your school clothes. Dinner will be ready by the time you're done. - Are you sure? 'Cause I can fix something at home. - Oh, Danny made chicken and dumplings, that's my father's recipe. You can't make that at home. (both sip soup) Needs a little paprika. - No way. - Do you know how many times I've made this meal? - It needs more salt. - It certainly does not. (Danny adds salt into the soup) (both stir into the soup) (Henry sips soup) - (chuckles) I told you. - If we ever get to the bottom of this part, I'm gonna teach you how to make my Cross Creek Jelly. - Is it good? - Oh, good. People walk for miles with nothing but a spoon, just to get a taste. - Nothing but a spoon? Get out of here. (Henry laughs) Did you and your dad cook together? (soup dripping) - So can I help set the table? - Yes. Yes of course. Silverware is in the drawer near the sink and the glasses are in the cabinet behind you. - Right. (door bell rings) - I'll get it. (silverware clattering) - That smells good. - Yeah, well, it tastes good. - Mh-hmm. - Slipped my mind all together, that I had asked your father to come for dinner same night I asked your mother. Mrs. Potter, the plates are right behind you, we're gonna need four. (plates clattering) - And then the church asked me to direct the choir and all the musical programs. And as I'd, I'd always wanted to do that, I just said yes. - My wife loved church music. Every Sunday we sit up front, she'd close her eyes and let the choir carry her away. - You know, I sang in that church choir all my life. - That's how they met. - You were in a choir, Mr. Potter? - Until they found out I couldn't sing. (all laughing) - They made him stand in the back and just fake like you was singing. - (chuckles) I was good at that. - (chuckles) No, not really. (Mr. Potter laughs hard) After the first show, they asked him to hand out the programs. (all laughing) - That was a very important job. - He was like the waterboy for the choir. (all laughing hard) - What? You didn't even like to sing. - I liked you. - Dorothy would drag me sometimes, to her Garden Club meetings. That was torture for me. (all laughing hard) But she would, she would go fishing every now and then. And I knew deep down, that she didn't care for that. (Henry and Mr. Potter laughing) (Karen takes a deep breath) The harder it was for her to do a thing for me, the more she wanted to do it. - And you felt the same way. - Yeah. - This is where I wanna rest, Henry. I wanna watch those trees turn color in the fall and I wanna hear the birds sing. Feel the breeze on my face. Come here, Henry. Come here. (grass rustling) I want you to see what I see. (soft somber music) - How will I live without your love? - I won't stop loving you after I'm gone, and you won't stop loving me. We will always love each other. - Yes. - For all of time. (footsteps plodding) (insects chirping) (owl hooting) - Well, wasn't so bad, was it? - (chuckles) No. (clears throat) not so bad. - I mean, you know, first time we've had dinner together in a long time. It's 15,000 brick. Henry says we have to fire 25,000 to get 22 and I think we're gonna make it. (insects chirping) - Dear, do you understand what happens to me if Cobb delivers his brick? I lose the race I worked my ass off for. I lose the bonus that goes straight to Danny's college. It's business. - Not everything is business. Some things you do, just because you should. - Like cancel your rehearsals and work for Cobb? - For Danny and Henry, yes. - You never did that for me. - They needed me. - I needed you. (soft wistful music) I'm just trying to be the man my father was. - No. His way isn't the only way. - He took care of everything. He took care of me and my brother and my mother. Everything made sense in his life. He knew where he belonged. - And you don't? - Not in your new life. I can't compete. - It's not a contest. - Everybody gets something, Danny, you, Cobb. What do I get, Karen? What the hell do I get? - You don't get anything, Mike, until you decide, what it is that you want. (footsteps plodding) (owl hooting) - You want to keep two fingers between them, so the heat from the fires and the arches will the rise the same through the whole stack. Mr. Hedgecock used to say, Henry, take care when you set the kiln. Your first chance- - First chance is your last chance. - Did you come all this way, to work or to interrupt me? - It's a big job to build and fire kiln. Henry can't do it all by himself, so he needs us for the heavy lifting, and to finish his sentences (laughs) But don't tell him that, it'll just make him crazy. (indistinct) - Nice to have you here, Lewis. - Nice to be here, Henry. - So how long till we finish? - About a week. - We're cutting it way too close. - Yes, we are. - My hearing is on Thursday, you know, at that school. - I remember. What you gonna tell them? - That I wanna go back. I wanna know, all of the things that you know. - You gotta read a lot of books. - That's okay. I wanna find something that I love to do as much as you love to make brick. (gentle music) - You did very well in your exams (paper rustling) and your term papers. And while that's a positive sign, the board is considering your behavior today, not your grades. - We simply won't allow you to return to Washington unless we believe that your behavior is going to change. - And you've made that very hard for us to believe, Danny. - Mr. Keenan, (sighs) Danny has been living with Henry Cobb, for the last six weeks. He's been helping Mr. Cobb, make the brick for the new library. And in that time, Mike and I have noticed a big difference in Danny. - Is Mr. Cobb coming to the hearing? - No. He's, he's under a tight deadline. - How do you believe you've changed, Danny? - I don't blame anyone else for the way I act anymore, and I know I'm responsible for what I do. And I don't wanna do anything bad again. I don't wanna be that kind of a person. I didn't, I didn't even care about that before. And I know I have to prove that to you, but Henry took a chance on me, and I didn't let him down. And if you take a chance on me, I won't let you down either. - You sound sincere, Danny, but how do we know you mean it? - May I say something? - Yes. Please, come in. (Keenan clears throat) We (clears throat) we understand that Danny has been living with you. - Yes. - Why is that Mr. Cobb? - He needed some time to think things through, away from both his mother and father. - So he ran away from home, in a manner of speaking? - In a manner of speaking, he needed someone to talk to, and I needed that too. - Mr. Cobb, in spite of what you both did or did not need, this boy is in serious trouble. - It's going to take more than just your say so to change our minds. - As it should Mr. Quinn. A decision as consequential as this one requires the whole of your life experience, does it not? Mr. Quinn, do you recall a young Washington boy who set firecrackers off during an assembly, the gym filled with children? (Mr.Quinn sighs) It wasn't the first time this boy had done such a thing, put other children in danger, was it? - No. - And that boy was given a chance. And grew up to be a fine man. A respected member of our faculty, didn't he? (Mr.Quinn nods lightly) You must consider all of Danny's life, when you make this decision. Just as you must remember all of your own lives, your own mistakes, your own apologies. Danny, deserves that. He's ready to make amends, he told me so. (Danny sighs deeply) Thank you. - And you believe him? - Of course I believe him. We're friends. (footsteps plodding) (gentle wistful music) - Dad, dad, let's go to the park. Come on, I wanna fly the plane. - If he doesn't deliver, start using my brick. I don't care if he's five minutes late. Are you listening? - Yeah, five, five minutes late. - They'll see the library going up around schedule, and nobody will have a word to say. (mobile phone chipping) (indistinct chattering) What the heck is the matter with you today, Mike? - I need a few days off, Carl. - For what? - I wanna help my son. - Help him with what? - Fire Cobb's brick. - Are you out of your mind? - I thought about this a lot. - No. (chuckles) No, you haven't, Mike. Because you've been had, you'd know that question would piss me off and you wouldn't ask me. You would say, I am not helping Henry Cobb. Because if I do, then I lose my raise. I lose my bonus. I lose my damn job. You work for me, Mike, don't forget that. - Takes a week to fire the brick, 1100, 1200 degrees. - And then 24 hours a day, for four or five days, to get up to about 2000. - How does he know how hot it is? - By the glow of the brick, he looks inside. - Wouldn't a thermometer be easier.? - Well, that could be off 20 degrees or more, either way. - So he trusts his eyes instead. - He trusts the brick. He knows how much heat they can take. He told me you ran away from home, like he did. - What? - He and his father didn't get along, so he ran away. Came to Springfield, went to work for Mr. Hedgecock. He was 12 years old. A couple of years later, his father took ill and died. He wasn't there when his father needed him most. He said that was the biggest mistake he ever made. - Yeah, well, at least his father needed him. - All fathers need their sons to make them feel whole. I got four boys of my own, so I know that's right. You know a kiln this size, needs at least eight men to fire it, 12 would be better. - So how many do we get? (Lewis chuckles) Two, you, me, Henry and my mom make six. - Yap. - We'll never be able to... (footsteps plodding) (wood clattering) (indistinct chattering) (fire roaring) - More heat in the fire arch, more heat in the the middle stack. - All right, Henry. (wood clattering) - Isn't it noon yet? - It's 1:30 in the morning. - Thanksgiving? - No, I think that's over. - Let me see. - The way he does that, reads the fire, It's incredible. (fire roaring) - How's the heat? - Yeah. Looks good. - This is where I wanna be, with you and Danny. I miss you. - I miss you. - First two arches need more fire. Use the six foot timber. Danny and I are going- - Henry, look... - Oh! (fire roaring) Ugh! (Henry falls off the ladder) - Henry. - Henry, are you all right? - (moans) I'll be fine. Just help me up. - There you go. - Careful. - Is it broken? - Just got twisted. All the heat is being drawn up through the back. I got to get up on the roof and close those vents. - He can't climb the ladder. Henry, you can't walk. - I'll go up. - Use those wooden shoes, is 2000 degrees in there. Put as much wood as you can on the front side, we got to heat the heat up. - All right. (tense gentle music) - Use the brick to cover the vents on the back, about eight foot square. - Got it. (tense gentle music) - Is it all right? - I don't know. Maybe it's nine-foot we should cover, 10, I can't tell unless I'm on the roof. (Mr. Potter coughing) Mrs. Potter, we need more wood in the third arch. More wood in the third arch, please. (Mr. Potter sighing deeply) (fire cracking) (wood clattering) - Mr. Potter? (fire roaring) Mr. Potter? (Danny sighing deeply) - Got it. (Karen sighs deeply) - More wood on the fire. More wood on the fire. (wood clattering) (gentle music) (fire roaring) - What happened? - He sprained it last night, about 2:00AM. Fell off the ladder. - So who went up? - I did. Put brick down on the back left corner, about an hour later, I moved it over to the right, and took it all down when the sun came up. (wood clattering) (fire roaring) - Well, I'll see you noon, tomorrow. - Don't remind me. - That's all the fire they can take. Close it up. (Danny sighs) - Close it up. - Okay. - You heard him, close it up. (iron sheets rustling) (bell tolling) - It's nine, Charlie. Shall we? (bell tolling) Let's go. (Carl clears throat) (gentle music) (trucks approaching) (trucks honking) (gentle uplifting music) (indistinct chattering) (brick chinks) - Got a ring too, Mr. Douglass. Good brick. There's 5000 on the truck and we load another 5000 by the afternoon, bring the rest by tomorrow. - Carl, we'll use these. - Excuse me. - Thank you, Mr. Cobb. We're all grateful to you. - You're fired, Mike. - Mr. Redden, I'm back to work now, so if you still want brick for the other schools- - That is exactly what we want. - Congratulations, Danny. - See you in school, Danny. - I still have my contractor's license. To tell you the truth, I miss working for myself. I'm looking forward to it. - If you need brick... (all laughing) - I know who to ask. - Mrs. Potter... - Thank you. - I'm happy for you both. You belong together. - We've still got work to do. - Dorothy and I worked at it for 60 years. - We'll be outside. - Okay. (footsteps plodding) (sighs) Thanks. - No, Danny, thank you. (soft music) - I'll come visit you. - I'll look forward to it. (Danny sighs deeply) (indistinct) (items clattering) - You gonna have to work harder than this, Lewis. They just gave me the contract to make the brick for Springfield School system. - Well, does it mean that you can finally afford to pay me an honest day's wage? 'Cause right now, I'm making less than Chester here. - Nice to have you here, Lewis. - It's good to be here (laughs) Oh! Yeah! Come on girl. Hey! - Heard you delivered the brick for Dorothy's new library. - I did. - Heard you going to be making the brick for the other schools too. - That's right. - Sounds like an awful lot to do for a man who stopped working. - Oh, I can't stop working, Ruth Anne. - You can't. - Of coarse, not. I'm the last brickmaker in America. (Ruth chuckles) (footsteps plodding) Brought you some Irises. It's gonna be a beautiful day. Turns out you were right, seems plenty of people still want handmade brick. I should have known, you'd be right about that (Henry sighs deeply) They'll be waiting for me back at the yard but I think I'll sit with you here for a little while. Listen to the birds sing, feel the breeze on my face. (soft serene music) (Henry sighs deeply) (soft serene music) (flute playing) (bright energetic music)
