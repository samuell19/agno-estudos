Stupid... - You haven't paid the utilities. - Right. - When will you pay? - Next week. - OK, I'll wait. - I will Good day. Stupid... What did he want? Utilities problem? That's not the problem. The problem is that there are no jobs anymore. There's no way to work in this shitty country. As if everyone was born with computers and internal... Now you've gotta have a re-su-mee or whatever the hell... Resume. Resume on email... What's a resume? It's a... A kind of autobiography. So why not call it that? And how do you send it by email? Hi. You... called me? You... were so rude on the phone? Yes... Sorry... Whatever... I had something to tell you... So you are the girl with long legs from the club? Hard to belive isn't Wait, I still don'! believe you. Come on, Cucu and Kalmu asked you to make fun of me. I don't know who Cucu and Calu are... Sorry. - You filled in that ticket... - Yeah. And... you won. You don'! fucking say. So what the hell did I win? T-shirts? Some lighters? One million Euros. I'm not kidding. Cut the crap, you with your million and your shitty cigarettes! You're really stupid. You won... one million in that shitty cigarette raffle, yes. And I, stupid me, thought you'd be glad... And I hoped... Since I made you fill in that ticket and since I also called you... I thougt... maybe you might give me some money... You really don't get it, do you? This is me when I dress up for promotions. If you scroll down you have the photo of the winning ticket. This is proof you've won. They usually let the promoter who filled in the ticket to contact the happy winner... You are the 'lucky winner'. Anyway, you need to go tomorrow to do the paperwork, to get the money. You'll be taken around TV stations... - You'll be famous. - Can I have a cig? It's the first time the prize is so big... Since they were banned from TV ads. So you're rich now... Do you get it? What you say is cool, ...but... We have a huge problem. What problem? That's not my name. What do you mean? It's you... This is the ticket, it's the last one I filled in. 076459... Isn't this your number? Isn't your name Tocilu? The number is mine. But I made up the name. Wait. Don'! tell me you filled in a different name. You're not Tocilu? No, that's not my name. It could have been, but... What do you mean 'it could have been'? Is your name Tocilu or not? No. My ID says Bratosin. Don't make fun of me, please. No, I'm not... You really wrote a made-up name? What the fuck do we? I mean, do you do...? You're going to lose the money... You've lost them. My dad... That's my dad's name. I think. I found some letters sent by a guy... Tocilu. I read one and I realized he could be my father. Then before I got my ID, they asked me which name do I wanna keep, Tocitu or Bratosin? Mom said Bratosin, why Tocitu? Mom never told me who he was and where he was. - But your name is Marius, right? - Yeah. Good. - And your dads name is Tocilu. - Yeah. That means you're "Tocilu" in your birth certificate. Why are you silent? I can't believe it... Fucking hell, one million Euros... I'm sorry, I can't help myself... Wait, wait, don't lose all hope just yet. You have one month to claim your prize. Right That means we still have a month. We find your dad, he acknowledges you, you get an ID that says Tocitu Marius, just like the ticket... They can't deny you the prize. Your name, your number, your signature... You get the money and that's it... it's ok. Another day The software is the unseen pan. It means all the programs a computer is using. They can help you do almost anything you want. Watch movies, see photos, access the Internet, send an e-mail, write a resume you can later send by pressing "Send to all'. We press the button. Not now! And we hear a low rumble... something like ...a kitty purring. That means that the unit is on and the cooler is working. It is essential for the cooler to start working, since that's what cools down the unit and motherboard. After the monitor is on, you'll see in the left-hand bottom comer, the word "Start" Same as in Romanian. From here we open programs to work with. But that, next time. Any questions? To buy a second-hand computer, raise your hand. Thank you. See you next time. Good morning, Doctor. The patient in 5, should I bring him here? No. In his room. Good morning. How are you feeling? I need to take some blood. Easy- Men always faint when they see blood. Easy... What are you doing here? Is my father's name Tocitu? Is he still alive? Get out... you can't come in here like that. Please wait outside. Answer me! Have you gone nuts? People are staring at us. Please excuse him, he's not feeling well. So his name is Tocilu. - Where does he live? - We'll talk outside. Is he alive? Yes or no. - Stop it. - Yes or no. Mr. Androne! So? Marius? She doesn't even know if he's still alive. I think she doesn't want to tell me anything. You told her why you're looking for him? Maybe... I'll never tell her, ever. Why? I'll never tell him if I'll find him. How? "Dad, I never searched for you the last 22 years," "but now, I put your name on a raffle ticket and I won," "I can't get the money since I have my mother's name." "So the money's the reason why I'm looking for you, dad," "otherwise I don't give a fuck about you, ...bastard." "You know my nickname's been Orphan ever since I was a little kid?“ Is that what I should tell him? "Take the money and give it to me", since he left me? I cant do that I can't. I have an idea. Listen to me Your father isn't the only Tocitu right? Right. Then let's find the other Tocitus. What kind of name is Tocitu? Any ideea? No other Tocitu in your family? My mother should know. I don't know my father's family. Marius, focus, we can't afford to lose this money I mean... you can't. I know somebody at the Telephone Company. We take the telephone books and search for all of them We'll make a deal with one of them. It will work. Think, everybody needs money. We'll give him 100000 Euros if we need to... He must agree! Yes, we'll do ma. - Really? - Really. What was that? Why are you doing this for me? - What do you mean? - What do you really want? - I want to... - What? What? I don't want the company to take the money... they have enough money and they paid us peanuts... I want some money, if you think I deserve it for the help I'm giving you. I want you to be happy with all that money. I want the money. That's all I want. Stop crying. I'm glad I met you. I really like you. Screw the money. I'm not going to look for my dad just for the money. I'll manage... I'll make money anyway I really like you. I don't like you! Without the money, you're just a fucked-up kid. Hands off! Fuck off! I'm six years older than you. Copy. This function is activated by pressing F5... Where does this go? Here, somewhere. - Look, Mr. Buzila. - Yeah. Delete. 'Dilit' in Romanian.

First I have to learn how to write a resume. Then I have to send it by e-mail. The teacher is a cool guy, he promised he'll give me an older computer. He's defrag... defragmenting it, whatever, for me only 2 million, TV screen included. Not TV screen... It's called... Monitor! It's not expensive, right? He'll bring it here. And I'll teach you too.

My mom lives here. She broke up with dad, just like yours... Only I know my dad. That's the only diference... a loser. Last time I saw him, he asked me to date an Italian guy ...for money... Cool, ha? No, no... He says I'm not his daughter. That my mom was kinda easy and... It's a good deal. An upgrade from a friend... These are much more expensive. This is an LCD that costs 18 million. You don't have that kind of money. Let's go. Sorry, we should go, I dont have much time. Forgive me. - And never cover the cooler. - Yes, it could break... Any way everything is written in your notebook. The Internet's working now. I'll install an antivirus tomorow, but please don't forget about the money. The computer was mine, a friend upgraded it... Sorry. I'll pay you as soon as I can. If the monitor changes colors again... I'll change it It's not broken, it's only the RGB. You saw the prices of LCD's... You now have an e-mail account, the password is in the notebook. I'll teach you how to avoid spams next time... Chpams... Spam - Mails you never open. It doesn't matter... You can send resumes anywhere you like with just a click of the mouse. "Send to all", you remember. Mr. Buzila, my friend and neighbor. My teacher, he helped me with the computer. Delighted! - Delighted. - Yeah, me loo. I'm so glad you helped him. I wanted to come loo but I had work to do. If you need, I'll paint your house for free. Really? - See you in class then. - Of course. I'll come,... I'll go now. Thank you again. If the monitor doesn't go off, don't worry It gives a nice light in the room. - Don't forget about the money. - I promise. - I'll see you in class. - Thank you again. There're two in Bucharest. Two Marius Tocitu One isn't answering. The other one is allways busy... What do you have? I found a Tocitu Marin in Sibiu. Marin? There's a Tocitu in almost every town, but none of them is a fucking Marius... Listen, let's invent something like: ...his name is Marin but people call him Marius. And he wrote Marius... don't know What do you think? 200 including the color monitor What's wrong! Ups! This was the ventilation... You see... it's very important to work... you must not cover it. It will damage the TV... and ma... what's it called... The... "drive" What's wrong? - Maybe it's broken. - Broken my ass. It worked before... Or maybe it's broken. No, he wouldn't give me a broken one! You know shit! It has to get warm, to get used to... Broken my ass! Come on! I hope it's not the motherboard... But it can't be! It worked fine a minute ago! Let's see... Error... Let's restart it. We need to re-restart it. Restart... - That's right! - What's that? Gog! And you know how to use... this. Don't you see I can? May I? Don't touch it... wait. Let me explain you first. Wait and watch... Let me show you. "Enter"... or... My God... It's like NASA... Not yet... Look. Do that again... please. Wait... This is not a toy. Look, with this program I can write anything. Including a CV... And it also has Email... Tocilu Marius, Brasov. 32 Tamplei Street Sorry... Tampei 32. - The very first book I touched. - Good work! It' a good sign that I found a Tocitu in the first 3 minutes. My feeling is that it's gonna be cheap - 10,000 Euro - Give me the number. - I'll call him. We said we'll call them all from my place when we have the numbers And what if they have cell phones? Old guys don't have mobile phones. If they do, they keep them next to the home phone... Let's just call this one. But why call just old people Think we've got a better chance with an older guy? Maybe we find a kid with that name who will go right along. I know you don't want to find your dad. It would be best if we found him. It makes sense. You split the money. Maybe he's sorry! Easy- His ID, your phone number The money stays in the family. - Are you listening? - Yeah. - We do it like this? - No. It's complicated, Mr. Buzila. It's not easy at all. I'm lucky the teacher helps me, he translates things... Eat, Mr. Buzila. I learned Russian in school. All sorts of complicated words. You know that for "resume" you write CV? I didn't know. - CV? - Yeah. It means something, but I don't know now... You've gotta study a lot. The borch is real good. How do you make it so good? It's easy. just boil everything, then add sour cream. If you add sour cream, everything tastes good. So when do they hire you? They're not hiring. They just prep you. How to write a CV, send it by e-mail... - E-mail... - You know what I'm gonna do? Wash the dishes? I'll get my notebook and study, you wanna see? What's this Mr. Buzila? It's on... Didn't you say you programed it to turn off? Yes, I did... Let's see... So... To turn it off... You go to the toolbar, and click Start... How come "Start"? Doesn't “Start" mean start? I mean, to start it? Shouldn't you click "Stop"? Must be a button that says “Stop" to turn it off... Not Start! Something's wrong! I don't know, That's what it says here, so that's what I'm doing. You weren't in the class! Just asking. So... Tell me about the e-mail thing. So you send a job application and they hire you. How do they answer? Not by mail? Is it safe by email? Yes, it's safe. My classmates sent e-mails and they got an answer back. No jobs now... But they got an answer by email... I'm learning now and I'll send some too. You saw... All the state institutions and big companies use e-mail Yes, it's safe. Now they hire you. I hope so. I'm learning computers... I hope I'll find a job. They have to hire me. When I took over the warehouse, what did I know? Nothing! I took care of it by the book... How's the information coming through? What's with this questions? It's complicated... I don't know how to explain it to you... He put the telephone wire into the computer. The next morning How much money do you have? 160 lei... My mother gave me 50 Euro... If necesary, we can use it No way. We're using only my money. What are you looking at? - Funny! - What? It's funny to watch my mom without her knowing. Are you changing the subject? You're afraid that I'll ask for more if I bring in some money. I'm kidding, don't pull that long face! I know we're sharing everything. We're sharing, but let's get it done first. We'll get it done. Kalmu is here... No point in staying here The guys in Bucharest don't answer We can call them from Brasov. Wait a sec. Yo, man. I'll call her from the station. Hi! - What time's your train? - In half an hour. - Now I'm a cab driver? - Drive. I know what to tell them. I have a friend in Brasov, We can sleep at her place. We'll bum the train ride and ...hitchhike to Valeni. If fail, we come back and look for the other two. Did you fuck her? Come, you must see. I have work to do. Did the paint crack? Look. "Hello... my name..." Inbox. Watch this, Mr. Buzila. "You have been selected"... Selected, got that? "A million pounds from the London Lottery". What? I don't get it. I know you don't get it. I didn't get it either. I've read it countless times. Listen, Mr. Buzila. Today I went to get my last paycheck. There's a guy who used to work in England. I asked him what's that "pounds". He laughed, but he said it's their money. You know? British pounds. Did you buy a lottery ticket? No, I haven't! All I did was to send a job application. You understand? Maybe it's the "unemployed lottery"? Is there such a thing? You're in the lottery, whether they hire you or not. Mr. Buzila, you might be right. What if I won the lottery and became rich? My left eye was twitching the day they fired me... I didn't feel much... Like I knew something good will happen. But are you sure? I don't know. But this guy said he knew a guy who had a friend who knew someone who got 3 million dollars from a black guy in Africa just to help him get some money out of his account. By e-mail! So did that friend of a friend get the money? Or was it a hoax? He says he did... And disappeared with it, too. Then you're loaded, I guess! Nina's not a sure thing yet! Who the hell do I call? My phone doesn't work. Call your teacher from my place. He should know about these things. - No. Not good. - Why? He might say it was his computer... that he sent the e-mail... to the lottery He could say... I didn't pay him yet. Nah, that won't do. I'll give him some money afterwards. I'll give you something too. I'll give you something too. But let's see how much that is in Romanian money. Street or Alley? They're two of them. Hurry up a bit please, I don't have much time. The street, please. I'Il do the talking... Yes, come in. - Does he bite? - No. - Come in. - Hello. - Is this the Tocilu residence? - Yes. Sorry, we rang, but... - Is Mr. Tocitu at home, please? - Yes. What is this about? It's about... There's the possibility of winning a campaign raffle. I mean, can we speak with him a bit? - Speak with him? - Yes. I don't know if you can... But do you know my husband? I mean, have you seen him before? Have you spoken with him? Ever? No... That's just it. We tried calling on the phone, but there was no answer. We came from Bucharest. Only 2 minutes, please. Well, if you must... Come in. - Thank you. - Since you're here and all... Take a seat. I'll go get him ready. Take a seat. What did she say? What did she mean by "get him ready"? What are you doing? What? Let's go. Now! Come in. Please come in. Please. 2 gentelmen came from Bucharest. They want to make a proposition. Tell him. He's deaf and paralysed for five years. Yes, yes, yes wait, wait, wait calm down, calm down. If you want to talk to him I can help you... I don't know what to say... we didn't expect... You didn't expect? Who are you, really? I saw right through you. You're a couple of cons and you want to rob us. Trying to get some money, maybe for drugs. You do weed, right? No, it's not like that. You misunderstood, ma'am. That's not what we intended. - We're good kids. - The hell you are. You suddenly became good kids, you weren't expecting this. You know why I let you in? I'm desperate! I hope you're mean enough to kill the both of us. If you kill us, I'll tell you where the money is. We've got 200 lei in that book on the dresser. Ma'am... I'm terribly sorry. We're not here to... rob you! On the contrary! We wanted to give you money, but You can't help us miss... We promise that if... Maybe we can help you... Don't make any promises, miss. You'll forget us the moment you walk out that door. Please, go. Go! Please, go! You can't help us. GO... ANT... I... AN... "Senate... Senator... Send." To send. I told you "Send" is for sending stuff. We've got to send some money to get the prize. And if "acount" means bank acount We have to go to the bank to send that money. They'll give us the lottery prize, Mr. Buzila! You'll be loaded! - How much did I say I'd give you? - You didn't. I didn't? Well, how much would you need? About... I'll give you 150,000, Buzila! 150,000! Let's recalculate... You said we have to send 2000. Right. For the papers and to receive... the money in the account. And I put 500... all my savings... You put 450, and your coleague put 200... and wants 2000... He doesn't want anything, I'm a lord. He doesn't want anything. He puts in 200, I give him 2000. And I'll give you 100,000! - You said 150. - Right, sorry, 150. I gave another 400 in the beginning. Buzila, 150,000! 500, 900, same thing! So. 2 plus 5, plus 4, 11 plus 50=1150 4150. So we need 950 more. - 850. 850, right. Where the hell do we find the rest till tomorrow? Should we get someone else in? I could get an advance on some jobs. But I'm afraid I'll get too spoiled and I'll get a bad name Don't be stupid! If we get the money, you can pay them back duble. You drive down in your Mercedes and tell them you're busy for the weekend. No way I'm paying them double... I got other plans with the money. I'll go finish their house. The last day Drajna is right ahead. What's your business with him? Not that I'm interested. I'm just asking. Whoa, look at that! The flash floods did it. It was a disaster! I wonder how come I don't know him! - Tocitu who, again? - Marius. Oh well, if you've got the address you'll surely find him. That's the road. That's as far as I can take you. Try to get over that bridge, or you've got a ten-mile detour. - Thanks... - No, no, it was my plesure... Here, have some nuts... Thanks a lot. Bye. - No, no, wait! - What? I can't cross! I'm scared. It's easy, I can even tum around. Your problem... I can't go over that. - It's easy, come on! - I'd rather take the detour. Hello. Come on! Even the little girl crossed it. Yes, I saw that. What now? Give up? Look... - What are you doing? - Wait. What's that? I don't get it. Go on. - What? - Walk on that imaginary board. What for? For me. Thank you. It's easy like this. I can even tum around. It's as easy as on the beam. Actually, this one's narrower. - There's height and water... - It's all in your head. It's about the way you see reality. Let's try it, please. This must be it. What number? - Number 2. - 2... Who are you looking for? - I can't believe this! - What happened? When? This Saturday? Not yet... I don't know. I'll call you back. Bye! Cristina says that if we dont claim it until Saturday, they'll draw another ticket. Fuck! What do we do now? The guy from Constanta is a sailor... The one in Bucharest is not picking up. Lets call the guy in Calarasi again... Give me your phone. 22-13-14. Hello. Mr. Marius Tocitu? How long ago was that? It's not his number anymore... Any idea where... Spain! OK, thank you. But wait! Hello? What now? Call the guys in Bucharest again... Why don't you call? I'm sick of it. It's hopeless... Hello... He picked up. You talk. Hi. Can I speak with Mr. Tocitu?, Marius Tocitu. Oh, he's in France... Today? Who are you? What time will he land? 18:45.0topeni. OK. Thank you. But he's definitely coming today, right? OK, thanks. Thanks. It was a kid. I think it was his son. He lands in Bucharest at 18:45 What time are we getting to Bucharest? We'll be there at 5. Aren't you glad? Are you OK? I know this is hard for you. It's important to find him. And it would be best if he's your father. Do you hear me? What would it be like to talk to him... without him knowing that I'm his son... For him it's real easy. Someone calls, he has no clue who. For me it's tough. I can't help thinking, what if it's him? Is he married or not? Does he have any children? Maybe he's got kids and... Have you ever wondered how your father's voice sounds like? You come across a nice warm voice, and you almost wish it were his. Then you hear a harsh smoker's voice... And you mink... Is he a drunk? Does he have kids? Does he need another son? - Hello. - Hello. I'd like to send some money abroad. - Do you have an account with us? - No, why? You can't. You must have a bank account with us. What do you mean, I can't? I have the money here, on me. I'm sorry. You have to have an account with us. Any bank you go, they'll tell you the same. Bring in a payslip, we open an account for you, you pay the opening fee, pay the transfer fee... and that's it. How much do you want to send? 2000. 2000 Euros? Yes, 2000 Euros. So how much is that together? Isn't it strange how we met? I mean, what a coincidence... to see you before we met, across the street, naked and sexy... You didn't see me, just those two jerks... Well... I did see you, just a little... You did, didn't you? How many times did you visit your mom's place? Let me think..., that was the second time. No... the first time since my mom left. Do you always walk naked like this? At my place, the window has a wall across. I didn't realize. It's my place, I can do whatever I want! You guys are obsessed! If that night you were the first time there... then it was our destiny to meet... Do you believe in destiny? A half an hour later, we'd have been gone out And we'd never have met... Do you believe in all that destiny crap? A pre-established path in life? That we were meant to meet? I don't believe that shit. It's just an accident and that's it. And it won't change out lives unless we get the money. Of course it's destiny. Look, now we are in this train... Let's suppose that the train derails... If we die, we die because you did your little striptease number. - That wasn't striptease! - You were naked! They wouldn't have seen you, we wouldn't have met and we would'! be on this train now, so we wouldn't die if the train runs off the rails. We didn't smoke yet, and you're tripping. So... If those jerk-offs Cucu and whoever... - Kalmu. - Yeah, whatever. If they hadn't seen me, you'd still have gone to the club I would have been there, for my job... ...convinced you to get the raffle ticket, and maybe than you would have filled in your real name, Bratosin or whatever it is. And than yes you wouldn't have been here. You'd be in a club with ten whores... showing off your millions. How much time do we have till the final draw? Give me a light. What difference does it make? Wait, take that... I cant forget yesturday ...poor woman You should have added tobacco. We'll get stoned... Exactly what I needed! What if one of them is your father? What does he look like? Have you ever wondered? Maybe he looks better than me and you fall in love with him. We find him, tell him, he has a crush on you... He's got the name, you get him to sign .. you're done. He's gonna be more generous. At his age, he'll never get a piece like you... You bet... What about me and your dad leaving you empty-handed... If you do so, I'll kill myself. Now, we bail for 250? Next week we'll be rich. Think, Mr. Buzila! How do we get 250 more? I got us all the money. I even took an advance for those jobs. It's mostly my money Don't be a jerk. For how much I'll give you, you shouldn't complain... Listen. What if we write them that we only send 2000, and they can pay us 250 less out of that big amount. We can deduct them from my money. You kidding me? Don't make me flip the page. I'm in big trouble! I'm in trouble with my sister... She gave me the money format computer class. She smelled something. She sent my brother-in-law to ask me about the money. He saw the computer... She's my sister, I have to give her something. But I give her as much as I want, not whatever she wants. Have you told her about the prize? No way! Didn't we have an agreement? They'd rip us apart! I mean me, since I got more relatives. How do you know I don't have any? Hook money from a cousin. So I'll give him something, because he helped me. - Did you tell him? - No. Look me in the eye! I can see you told him... No, I didn't! You just couldn't help bragging about my money! I told him it might happen, but it's not certain. What did we agree? We promised we wouldn't tell a soul until the money is here... And then we tell them... and make them all jealous! He just couldn't keep his mouth shut. - You bragged too, dude! - "Dude"?! Yes. you! I heard that you'll move out... once rich... the super told me... And that guy from your job... said everyone is gelous there you said you don't give a damn... So did you keep your mouth shut? My fault I let you speak friendly to me. You told me Call me by my name yes, but not to be rude... And I had to tell them... because everybody helped us And to my sister... too She wants to much... becouse we split the inheritance. Nevermind, I'll decide how much for her And I'll give the church also. But you should only give 2,000 to that colleague, What the fuck do you care how much I give him? It's my money I'm sharing, not yours! And anyhow, I think I'm giving you loo much. Yeah, I'm giving you loo much! OK, whatever you say, sir. In fact... I don't want anything anymore. Just pay me back whatever I gave you. Consider it a loan among fri... Neighbors. No interest, just for you. Come on, Mr. Buzila. What, you're upset now? Come on, we've got work to do! What are you doing? Smoking in here? For the 5 lei you gave me? Come on, scram! Come on, git! OK, sorry. Damn rockers! Put that cigarette out! Hello! We're doing a survey. Does any of you know Mr. Marius Tocilu? - I'm sorry. - What's he saying? - Do you speak French? Marius Tocitu? Is there any Marius Tocilu in this country? Anyone? Can anybody hear me? Is there any Marius Tocilu in this country? It's me, Mr. Buzila. I know you're there. - Hey. - Hello, sir. "Hello, sir"? - Still upset, are you? - I'm not upset. Why won't let me in then? Still upset. I just want my money back. ...the money I gave you. If you want to give me something OK, nothing more. It's your machine, it's your work, you went to school, you got lucky Why give anything? It's not like that Now I got lucky tomorrow it's your turn. When you have you share. That's the Christian way. Mr. Buzila. I'll give you what I promised. Oh please. We've got our pride. Just my money back... Listen... If you want your money back, I'll give it to you. But I got the rest of the money and I don't want to give up Forgive me, Mr. Buzila, please forgive me. OK... But... Forgive me. I was wrong. I had to brag a bit. I never got so much money overnight. It's only human... I wanted to ask you to wait at my place The phone company will come to fix my phone. I'll go make the payment. You want me to kneel down? Forgive me! It's gonna be OK. OK... OK. Thank you. Snap out of it. Call your friends to pick us up from the station. Will you? What hapened? Bring me a glass of water please. Tell me what's wrong. Bring me that glass of water. I can't move. Don't leave me hanging... God bless you... Mr. Buzila... I went to send the money, and I was coming back home in a great mood. Then I decided to see the teacher. Becoause he did help us... and maybe it would be nice to give him a bit of money loo So I went and told him and right off the bat he asked if I had paid anything. At first I thought it was all just spite, and if I hadn't paid he could squeeze in somehow. So I said I had. I'd paid. So I said I wouldn't tell him the name of the bank Then he started begging me He said if I didn't tell him I will be sorry... and that we have to go to the bank that if we hurry we can still cancel the transfer... But I still thought he was just lying so he could take our money. And I couldn't tell him because you know how many obligations I have... how many promises I made... Then he told me... I am a stupid old man. I started to believe him. And then he showed me on his computer that he also got con mail with money from London, God damn them all... We took a cab, we went to the bank and the woman told me if we'd come five minutes earlier we could have stopped it, but the wire or whatever had been sent, and the money were gone... It's all your fault! Only yours! It's all your fault! The Paris flight, right? You talked. It was a kid on the phone Can you trust a kid? Nola kid, a teenager. Did you fuck her? If this one doesn't show up we only have the guy at the Central Station. Hold the cardboard up so he can see it. What If he doesn't stop, how do we find him? He'll stop, if he sees his name... Did Giani send you? Yo! Did Giani send you? Wait a second, folks, there's some people there wanna talk to me. It's my name on the paper! Yo! Tell Giani it's OK with the money! I'll be out by tomorrow and I'm gonna take care... I had fought with everyone anyway, they were all upset they wanted more money... My sister was mad at me, my brother-in-law loo. Even you, Mr. Buzila, but you were too afraid to ask. Now let's see how upset you all get when you find out I've got nothing to give! It was hard to be rich. Now it's over, at least I feel better. What floor, the fourth? - What apartment? - 76. Why did you bring your friends at the airport? I thought it was only between me and you. Do you need support? They just helped us with a ride. - Look, 76. You ring. - I'll do the talking. - What if he's not home? - I'll sleep on his doormat. Hello. Excuse me, are you Mr. Marius Tocilu? Can we come in? We have a business proposition. A lot of money... - Have you ever met... - almost a million Euros. Can we come in, so we don't disturb the neighbours...? A woman by the name of Brato... Fuck your millions... Fuck your scams... Bratosin... You fuck with decent people! I'm sick of being a millionaire! Fuck you and your millions!
