[Heavy breathing] [Sniffling] [Knocking] [Phone chime] [Door closes] Do you want me to talk or not talk? I don't talk during the encounter, obviously, but do you want me dead now? Do you want to get to know me before I die? I ... don't know. I've never done this before. Maybe ... sit there? Why do you do this? Probably for the opposite reason that you hired me. A really good friend of mine killed himself because... He was really into me, and I wasn't into him... People say I'm probably why he killed himself, and I... I don't know... this is like me trying to... Deal with this if I can. I just need the money. Don't you have any big thoughts about death or anything? I'm sure it's depressing. So, how do you die? I mean, is there like a story or something? Suicide. Can it be because of me? Sure. I need to be doing my thing first. Where do you want to do this? I'm sorry. That's not about you. It's just part of being dead. I don't want to be an asshole, but... In the photos in your ad you didn't look like this. You looked really... Innocent ... like my friend. And it's cool that we're of like minds about the world, but I hired you because you looked like him, but much cuter, and I want to have sex with the guy I saw in the ad. I can't. Please, you have to. I'll take off all my shit too. [Nervous laugh] I'm really good at it. You'll see. There's this... It's almost like a meditation thing you can slow your metabolism way, way down. Guys are always very impressed. Okay. Shit, I hate feeling like this. - Are you still dead? - Yes If you were dead, I think I could probably do this. Wait. I won't charge you extra. In ten minutes, call my cell. If I don't pick up, I'm ready. [Door closes] [Water running] [Electronic music playing] [Electronic music playing] [Door creaking] That's amazing. How do you do that? [Electronic noise from headphones] [Spanks] It's so weird. I don't feel depressed at all. Thank you. I'm going to move you, if that's... oh, right, you don't care. You shouldn't let me do this. Fuck you. Just... fuck you. Can you be alive? Can you be alive? What did you say? Whatever you want. God, you're so scary. I know you just did it for the money, but thank you. I mean, really, thank you. [Background chatter] [Indistinct talking] The worst. When I was nineteen, my uncle, who'd been a painter and my hero as a little kid, but who'd later turned into an alcoholic womanizing leech who referred to me as "the pig," blew his brains out with a shotgun. [Music starts] When I was eighteen, this guy at a record store asked me if he could catch a ride... Somehow... [Electronic noise blaring] Somehow they hadn't realized that. They said that... When I was seventeen, I went to a party. My friends were getting high by shooting aerosol from altered paint cans into a paper bag and inhaling. They asked if I wanted to take a hit, and I said no. After I left, my friend Dave was shooting aerosol into the bag... He inhaled the paint, which coated his lungs, and he suffocated to death on the spot. My friends told me it was the most horrible death you could imagine. When I was fifteen, I took LSD... I took... I took LSD all day everyday for a month. One day I was hitchhiking when some guys picked me up. They drove me into a remote place and told me they were going to kill me. I think they were joking. I freaked out so much... I freaked out so much that they threw me out of the car and drove off... They... They threw me out of the car and drove off. For the next eight hours, I screamed... They threw me out of the car and drove off. For the next eight hours, I screamed... I screamed and convulsed and hallucinated on the ground... When I was fourteen, my own mother... My mother ordered me to get a... She ordered me to get a haircut... My mother ordered me to get a haircut. I refused... And locked myself inside a bathroom... I locked myself inside a bathroom... My father came home from work... My father came home from work... And kicked the door down... And kicked the door down... He kicked the door down... Ah! I saw my mother standing in the... I saw my mother standing in the doorway... I saw my mother standing in the doorway... I threw my arms around her... Begging her... [Gagging] Standing in the doorway... Begging her to make him stop... Begging her to make him stop... Begging her to... Instead... She turned me around and held me tight while... He hit me in the face again and again... When I was nine ... That's when I stopped trusting them... When I was nine, I saw a blonde girl my age. Wearing a very frilly dress. She stood on a walkway lined with burning tiki torches. She was the most beautiful thing I ever saw. While I was staring, a tiki torch fell, igniting her dress. Within a second, her whole body was on fire. 48 hours later, a policeman found me hiding under my house. I didn't remember anything. I don't know if she lived or died. [Music stops] Thanks. [Mic reverb] [Mic reverb] Do you have any heroin? You can fuck me. If you want my advice, cut your vocal cords out. It's a simple operation. Otherwise you're so awesome, it's scary. I'll be dead in two days. [Train passing] Do you want my ass or not? No, my uncle does. And he doesn't want it. He wants me to want it. I mean he wants me to have it first. So it's a trial run. But he's the one who has a thing for you. And he's not really my uncle. So, no, not technically. You lost me. He wants to be a cannibal. You should hear him talk about me. I'm a junkie, or I'd leave him. It's weird, but I saw that happening in a dream. I think I'm psychic. I dream all the time. Heroin's great. Then give me some. I need to buy a gun. I'll be dead in a couple of days. Besides, I make everyone depressed. Seriously. You have to smell you. Use your fingers. Being horny is the truth. You ought to try it. It smells like every other ass in the world, only much, much better. [Thud] [Heavy breathing] That's why I don't care if I die. If one more guy does this to me, I'm going to freak. My blood pressure's insane. You should charge. I do. Money's not my problem. Beauty is. It's weird. I used to be no one for years. You'll be no one again. Thanks, but death calls. That feels sadder than it sounds. [Heavy breathing] What do you mean by fistfuck? What do you mean by what do I mean? It's self-explanatory. I want to protect you from the world, and give you give anything you want. [Heavy breathing] I love you. I can't believe it. [Moaning] [Orgasmic moaning] [Creepy music] [Bells ringing] [Bells jingling] [Bells jingling] Strip naked. What the fuck are you? We've abandoned society's corporate laws and our corrupted human identities and chosen the lack of specificity that comes with being primitive animals, and we are starting the world over. But I used to be Marcel, and he was Antoine. But I'm okay with the society stuff, so why are you hassling me? [Bells jingling] I don't know. This has never happened before. What do you think, Marcel? Eliminating everything stupid and ugly and power structure-related from the equation, I'm left with, I think he's cute. Me too. But raping him would mean compromising his autonomy. But at the same time, I want him. We should parse the word want. If we raped him, we'd have to return to our human form because these stupid fucking costumes don't have zippers, and I can't see destroying our new world just to get laid. No, we'd be lost. [Bells jingling] How about if he Jacks off for US? That would work. [Thud] If you do that, circumstances will then arise that would cause you to be able to leave without our intervention. [Bells jingling] - It's cold. - Yeah, that part sucks. [Whimpering] I want it. Oh fuck, I really want some, Antoine. Tell me about it, Marcel. But we'd be giving up everything we've worked for. But would we really? Shit, well, isn't challenging one's assumptions of oneself the whole point? [Bells jingling] Totally. [Creepy music] [Heavy breathing] [Screams] It's those two anarchist weirdos Antoine and Marcel. I thought the wolf ate them. I think they were going to eat him. How do you figure? They were hiding him from the wolf. And they have to eat something. Makes sense. I want to rape them. It's too cold. We should take them back to town. [Bells jingling] Fascists. [Drone blades whirring loudly] [Wind blowing] [Ocean sounds] [Drone blades whirring loudly] [Drone sound] What are you thinking? I don't know - like what? What can I do for you? Can I do you a big favor? Do you want me to think of something? Yeah! Have it your way. I don't know. The only thing I can think of... But I don't know if you still want it... There's just something about you. It's not just the looks, although there's this tragedy to you, to what the drugs have done to your looks, that's incredibly hot. You've gone from really cute to beautiful in this scary, profound way. But it's not only physical. It's the whole thing. It's the way you are, the way you move, the fucked up shit, the boring stuff, what a loser you are, the whole thing. It just gets to me. You turn me on even more than you used to, since you asked. Yes, that's it. Yeah, just to know what having you would be like. I'm so fucked up. I'm a mess. I am just the scum of this fucking world. I'm just a pain in the ass. Nothing makes sense to me. I hate being fucking alive. I understand. Fuck. I'm so fucking selfish, and I don't even know what I want. I don't understand myself. I never did. I don't know why I do things and why I don't do anything, and I'm a pain in the ass. I really hate myself. You shouldn't, but you've never let anyone help you. I let you help me. Yeah, in your own weird way. I want you to help me, ok? It's just... I never understand why. I don't understand anything. I'm afraid of you. I'm afraid of my fucking self, you know?
