(Ball clacking) Yeah, terrific, I am your husband. Not when we playing a game. Have a nice walk. (Giggles) (Ball clacking) Oh, George. Don't choke. You're not gonna distract me. Oh, I hate to do this. Hey, what'd you think of Diane's fancy eyelashes? I thought they were so long they were practically in her chicken soup. Oh! (Laughs) — oh. Terrific. Oh, I feel guilty. (Laughs) Oh, tikky almost, gosh. Oh, George, you're always in the corner. You're gonna get yours. [George's wife] When? Just wait and see. Let me win first. Oh, George. [George] Careful, don't choke it now. Bowl! (Laughs) [George] (Laughs) You made it! Oh, I get another shot. You win. (George's wife laughs) How could you do this to me? Love me? You bet I do. Oh, George. Wanna mess around? Yes. Happy birthday, darling. I love you. (Smooching) You know something, George Manning. I wouldn't trade my life with you for anything. I love you, Karen. (Phone ringing) It's probably your mother. Hello. Oh hi, mother. His appendix? I'll be right there. I can't find them anywhere. Sometimes I think my head's screwed on backwards. Can't even imagine where they, could be. (Door creaking) Hope I make the plane. You have plenty of time. Just drive carefully, it's supposed to rain. Sure you don't want me to come with you? Honey, it won't be necessary. You've got your big meeting on Saturday you've been looking forward to. Don't worry about it. Just call me, and I'll fly right up. Okay, (smooches) Bye—bye. Bye—bye. (Peaceful music) (Thunder roaring) Billy wants to do what? Put his appendix in a bottle and take it to school? I love it. (Laughs) I love it, it's a great idea! Of course, he can. Terribly proud of him. And then I love him, and I'll call him tomorrow afternoon. (Thunder roaring) Sure, you can reach me at the office, I'll be in all afternoon. I love you too, bye—bye. (Doorbell chiming) (Bright orchestra music) Sorry to bother you really, but we're lost, and do you happen to know where the gregorys live? The gregorys? Not around here, no, I don't. (Lady in green sneezing) Gesundheit. Thank you. We have the address written down but we left the house in such a hurry, I guess we forgot it. Yeah, we figured we were lost when we didn't do a lot of cars around. I know they live around here somewhere. I'm sorry, I don't know them. I just can't help you. Could we use your telephone? Maybe get the address. — sure, of course, come in. Thanks. Please. (Door clicking) Excuse me. Boy, you are really drenched. This is interesting. Why don't you come in and warm yourself by the fire? Thank you. Hello operator, I'd like the number Gregory, g—r—e—g—o—r—y. (Uplifting orchestral music) Would you like a piece of pizza? Well, it looks delicious. But no, thanks, I'm on a diet. (Chuckles) My name's Donna, what's yours? George. Hi, George. You know, this is really nice of you. I mean like two perfect strangers coming off the street like this. Most people wouldn't do that today. [George] It's my pleasure. Excuse me, sir. What's the address here? 2946, north barker. We are so dumb, the part is on south barker drive, we're on north barker, we're on the wrong side of town. I told you we're going in the wrong direction. Susan, do you think somebody could come pick us up? Just a second. Do you think it would be all right if we waited here until a friend comes by to pick us up? Sure. Thanks, okay, thanks, bye. This plant's really fresh. Freezing. I know, god. Let me get you some towels or something to dry off with. (Thunder roaring) I got the clothes dryer working. The clothes should be ready in about 20 minutes. Oh, good. Jackson and Donna. [Girls] Ehm—hmm. Kinda sounds like a vaudeville team, doesn't it? We are kind of a vaudeville team. Yeah, we do have a lot of fun together. Is Jackson your last name? No, it's my first name. No, it's not. (Jackson shushing) She's lying. (Laughs) Come on, Jackson, tell him your real name. [Jackson] Be quiet. Okay, okay. Agatha. (Donna laughs) — oh, you promised! Oh, oh, you stop! Your hot chocolate. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. To you, George. To me, my 40th birthday. Far out. — happy birthday, George. Thank you. Do you get a lot for your birthday? Nothing new. (Donna laughs) (George laughs) Nothing new, oh whatever, I'll remember that one. George, how come you're spending your birthday alone? I mean, where's your family? Well, my children are visiting their grandmother in San Diego. My son took ill, so my wife flew down to be with them. Oh, I'm sorry, I hope he's all right. I'm sure he'll be fine, thank you. Wow, George, look at that stereo recorder! Gee, George, this is really beautiful. Well, you have a lot of albums. (Chuckles) Guess I do. You know that collection started when I was a little kid. Really? God, gee, this must cost a fortune. You must really be rich. Oh, that music sounds wonderful. I don't think I can go back to my little sit. But if you're not careful, you turn the sound way up, you could break a lot of glassware. What's this? Plans for a bank job? You know, Jackson, this is really nice. George, I mean, great music, warm fire, great company. I'm glad we knocked on your door, George. Um, I'd be even glad if you tell me where the sandbox is. The what? The toilet. Sure, through those doors and through the game room. (Donna sighs) Jackson's a nice girl. Ehm—hmm. You seem to be very good friends. We're great friends. Touch this hair, does this fee! Dry to you yet, George? Feel. No, it's still damp. Ehm. Hey, you know, George, how every once in a while, you meet somebody, and they're really great vibes? Well, that's how I feel right now. You're a nice girl, Donna. Well, I'm not a baby, you know? What kind of music do you like? Mostly rock, but really all kinds of music. I got something I'd like you to hear. Oh great. (Upbeat music) I love the savoy. [George] Oh, yeah? Well, my kids gave it to me for my birthday. Hey, that bathroom of yours is far out. You should see it, it's amazing. It's like, has all these things in there, like out of a health club or something. I've never seen anything like it in a house before. I'd really like to see it. Is it all right? Well, sure, go ahead and show her, Jackson. Come on. Okay. Don't go away. (Door clicking) It's... Wow. Didn't I tell you? I've never seen anything like it before. Look, come here. (Door sliding) A sauna too? Yeah.

[Agatha] Join the party, George. No, thank you, girls. Come on, George. — no way, girls. Please. — no, thank you. Come on. — I'm a happily married, man. I want you, George. (Sensual music) (Girls moaning) (George moaning) (Smooching) (Sensual music continues) (Girls moaning) (Fire crackling) You hungry? I could go see what he's got stashed in the kitchen. No, I don't feel like anything right now. You know, I could really fall in love with him. Donna. I could. In fact, I'm gonna go cover him up. I don't want him to catch a cold. (Enchanting music) (Blender revving) (Girls laughing) (Donna humming) Morning, George. Oh, good morning, George. We were just about to get you up. Good morning. I thought you would have left last night. Well, you were so nice to us, that we thought we'd stay and make breakfast for you. Donna, get the milk out of the fridge. You'd just be standing in the way there, George. But you said a friend would pick you up. You know, he never showed up. Hmmhmm. I'll hand—make some pancakes, okay? Sure, fine. Be back in a minute. (Playful music) Hi, George. Donna. George, why are you being so cold to me? Look, Donna. Last night just happened. I thought you like being affectionate, George. Maybe not in the morning, yeah? Come on, George. Let me hug you and kiss you. Love you, George. I want you so much. Donna, let me get dressed. All right, George. Well, I'm gonna take a quick shower and get nice and fresh for you. And then maybe after breakfast, we can make love again. All right, George? (Souring music) (George puffing) I love your shirt, George. Thanks for letting me wear it. (Utensils clanking) Oh, I'd love some syrup. Do you two girls live together? Pass the bowl. Where do you live? Why George? Well, so I can give you a ride home. Hmm? We're on the road, George. Oh, we don't have a home, George. I seem to remember you saying something last night about leaving that address to the party at home. Oh, that was just an expression, George. I lost the damn thing, that's what I meant. Well, I'll drive you wherever you wanna go. (Girls laughing) Did I say something funny? I wanna go to Paris. (Donna laughing) I'll rather stay here with you, George. Pass the ketchup. You know George, you should eat your breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, you know? (Agatha humming) (Girls laughing) Jesus. You have the manners of an alley cat. Fuck you, man. What? I was just teasing, George. Just a joke. She's just teasing you, George, honest. Get up and get your clothes now! If that's what you want me to do. Move your ass up there and get dressed. You know, George, you're acting a lot different from last night. And I don't like it one bit. (Footsteps clopping) (Playful music) (Agatha groaning) (Agatha laughing) (Bright orchestra music) [Radio host] Story of the hell drivers. A crash crazy, death—defying, won't give a damn real men and their crazy girl... (Playful music) (Loud music drowns radio host) Jesus Christ! Hey, George, are you into dirty books? This one's something else. Rodan seized the little girl's hands and thrust them into a pair of manacles. Littered with lust, the jaded physician slowly unbutton the little girl's blouse. But the child's body was a monument to perfection, soft, creamy, white skin. Round breasts. (Donna wailing) Sounds like a couple of girls you know huh, George? (Upbeat music) George. Hey, George, I'm glad you came up. Take that off. Why George? My wife's negligee, that's what? Now, take it off. I didn't think it was your negligee, silly. Look, Donna, what is this? What the hell's going on here? You know, George, your wife and I must be the same size. Look, her clothes fit me real well. Take it off. But George, what am I gonna wear? Are you kidding me? Get dressed in this, your own clothes. Georgie, Georgie, I know that you'd like to see me in something pretty, George. I was only trying to look nice for you. Look, Donna, I've been trying to tell you and Jackson all day, the party's over. Now, get dressed now! You sure change like the wind, George. That's right, George. You were sure very nice to us last night. You loved it. Yeah, what happened, George? Now, I think there's something you oughta know now, George. We're jail bait. Come off it. That's true, George. Wanna check our ids? No, I don't wanna check anything. I don't wanna see anything. I want you to get dressed, and we're getting outta here or I'm... Or what, asshole? You'll call the cops? (Laughs) (Donna laughing) Why don't you just do that, George? Go ahead and call the cops, George. Because I've got a story for them that's gonna make that rodan book of yours read like a nursery rhyme, understand? She's 15 and I'm 17. Do you know what that means? It's true, George, I'm only 15. Statutory rape, George. Shove that in your ear. Isn't that a drag, George? Operator, get me the police please. But I think that wife of yours is gonna be baking cookies in prison for you for the next 50 years. Gonna be remembered as a sex pervert. Oh, your honor, he seemed like such a nice man, but he tied me up, and he beat me, and he did horrible things to me. A natural thing you are. I saw him, I saw him. I saw him do it. So is the neighbor, your honor. I saw one looking at the house. I waved at him. That's right, George, your wonderful neighbors. What are they going to think? Think they want to live next door to a sex deviant? (Chuckles) I don't think so. And your customers, George? The people who work for you, what will they say? I bet they'll just love it. How about your wife, George, and the children? How will they take it? She'll take the house. And everything else. So go ahead and call the cops, George. It's your life. Do whatever you wanna do with it. Flush it down the toilet. What do you want? (Donna humming) (Donna giggling) I want to know what you want. What are you so angry about? George, I like you. You're different than the others. (Doorbell chiming) I'll get it, I'll get it! (Agatha laughing) Oh, oh, Mrs. Grossman. I'm terribly sorry. It slipped my mind. I was supposed to call you. The house is, the house is fine. We won't need you. Are you sure? I'm sure, Thursday. Please come Thursday. Awfully sweet of you. Goodbye, thank you. (Dramatic piano music) Was that your maid? (Antenna clicking) Didn't wanna make it a foursome, huh, George? You know that time, George, there was this nice guy. (Donna laughing) Got a nice young lady with a nice business. Like you, George. One day, this cute little chic came along and accused him of raping. Never heard such a commotion. You know, people relive that sort of stuff up, George. (Donna laughing) (Knee thudding) (George groaning) Who sought and swore he was innocent although he tried. And you know what? He lost. (Dramatic piano continues) (Groans) He was acquitted all right, but by that time, his nice old lady had split, and his nice business was down the drain. So you see what can happen to an innocent guy, George. What do you wanna do with me, George? [Donna] Georgie! What you wanna do to me? (Dramatic piano music) Who will give a shit now, isn't it, George? (Phone dial clicking) Operator, this is an emergency. Get me the police. (Phone switch clicking) You win. Get out. Wanna give us a ride? You gotta be kidding. Maybe one of your neighbors could give us a lift. Doesn't matter to us one way or the other. It's just that I didn't think you'd want us hanging around any longer than necessary. I won't go if you don't want me to, George. Let's go. (Playful music) Turn that station. God, that music sucks. Thought you like good music, George. (Agatha chuckling) Hon, want some gum? Hey, yeah. Hey George, you want some gum too? Have a piece. Hey, this is good. My breath is really bad. Wee. Oh, no. (Laughs) You didn't want some gum? (Laughs) He doesn't want any. Have a piece. Here George, come on, have some gum. (Hand slapping) Hey, you got a mirror? I look a mess. I'm tired of this gum. Why don't you throw it away for me? You rolled the wrong way. (Laughs) (Agatha laughs) It smells like George's pants! (Laughs) George, we're just kidding you. Do I look pretty, George? (Girls laughing) Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained, huh, George? You know you remind me of this old hound dog. I would still belong to these two old dykes in San Francisco. It's not that way with me at all. I think you're so handsome, George. Why are you so angry with me, George? I love you. That's a goddamn dumb thing to say. He could care less about you. That's not true, is it George? Well, tell her, man. Tell her the way it is. Look, I'll tell you the way it is.

(Car engine whirring) Bye. — bye. (Peaceful music) (Enchanting music) [George] Karen. [Karen] Hi, honey, I've been waiting for you. [George] How's Billy doing? [Karen] He came through it like a trooper. [George] When you're gonna bring him home? [Karen] Tomorrow, I'll be home in time to fix you dinner. [George] Great, put Billy on the phone. I'd like to talk to him. - [Billy] Hi daddy, you know it's really exciting. I think I'd like to be a doctor when I grow up. [George] I thought you wanted to be a baseball star. [Billy] Well, maybe in the off—season, I can be a doctor. Can I really take my appendix, just go and show it to my friends? The girls in my class are really getting sick just looking at it. [George] (Chuckles) I can't wait to see you, Billy. - [Billy] Me too, daddy. Here, mom wants to talk to you. (Giggles) [Karen] I miss you. [George] Me too. [Karen] Is everything okay?

(Sheets ripping) (Girls groaning) We tie you up, George. Gonna tie you up, George. Didn't know what he was in for, did he? [Agatha] It's really hot mace. Red—colored mace in Georgie's face. (Girls laughing) That's better Georgie. (George groaning) [Donna] Poor George, enough time to say his prayers before he went to sleepy by. [Agatha] Who gives a shit? (Laughs) It was fun.

Told you we'll have a real party. (Laughs) Stop, stop. What do you think, George? Do I look pretty? Come on, George. Jesus. I wanna go home. Untie me. Don't listen to that jerk. He's not a jerk and don't call him that. Okay, so he's not a jerk. I wanna go home. But I'm not wanted there either. That's why I ran away. Oh, you've been nice to me. I only wanted to love you, daddy. First day as mama brought you home, I loved you. No. And then one night, mama went upstate to visit her sister, and Betty was in my room when he went to bed. I took off all my clothes, and I tiptoed down the hall, pretended to be asleep. I only wanted to love you. Maybe you're not angry with me anymore. Are you, daddy? Are you angry with me anymore? I only wanted to love you, daddy. Since when the day that mama brought you home, I, I loved you. That's why I ran away. (Laughs) Will you be nice to me? Maybe you're not angry with me anymore. Since mama brought you home, I loved you. I only wanted to love you, daddy. You pretended to be asleep. Remember, you pretended to be asleep, remember? And then, I crouched beside you, and I did things to you, I drove you crazy! I drove you crazy! I did things that you never even read about. I did things you never even read about, and that's what I wanna do to you right now. That's what I wanna do to you right now. You taste so good, Manning.

(Uaughs) (Pants) (Bubbles plopping) He's dead. And he's dead too. Let's put the top on. (Thunder rumbling) Where were we? (Chuckles) Oh yeah. [Judge alter ego] Oh, the state versus George Manning. The defendant is charged with two counts, assault and battery to minors, two counts, statutory rape, and two counts, perverted and unnatural sexual acts to minors. (Donna laughing) How does the defendant plea? Wait a minute, your honor, he can't plea, he's gagged. (Agatha laughing) [Judge alter ego] Will the first witness for the state, please come fonnard. Yes, your honor. [Judge alter ego] Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, god? Yes, I do. [Judge alter ego] Tell us, when did you first meet George Manning? As I came walking down the street one day, he opened his front door, offered me, candy and cookies. [Judge alter ego] No, didn't your mommy and daddy teach you never to take food from strangers? Yes, your honor. [Judge alter ego] Well now, go ahead. First, he was real nice, but then he tried to kiss me. He said he never saw a girl as pretty as me. Told him, I had to go. He wouldn't let me go. [Judge alter ego] Then what? He started chasing me all over the house. I tried to get away, but he was too fast. [Judge alter ego] Yes. And then he threw me on the ground, and he ripped up my blouse. Then he started to... [Judge alter ego] Yes. He started... [Judge alter ego] Started what? Sucking your tits? Isn't that right? He started sucking your tits. (Donna laughing) He threatened me if I didn't let him. (Chuckles) [Judge alter ego] The witness will continue. I trusted him, your honor. He took advantage of me. He made me promises. He made me do unspeakable things. [Judge alter ego] Like what? Your honor, I don't know how I can go on. I don't know how I'm going to be able to live with myself? (Sobs) Oh, poor baby. (Donna laughing) The court will ask no further questions. The court now calls Jackson to the stand. (Thunder roaring) Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, god? I do. [Judge alter ego] Jackson, how do you imagine the truth is? Nice girls like yourself could have gotten involved in such a mess! (Statue smashing) (Donna laughing) (Agatha laughing) Well, I'm sure out of pure innocence, your honor. We never dreamed of someone living in such a nice home, in such a lovely neighborhood, such a beautiful family, could be such dread. What's dread? Garbage! (Books thudding) We thought he'd be a pillar of his community, didn't we, Donna? I wonder if he could be rehabilitated. Made a useful member of society. I don't think so. I think he's like all men, after whatever he can get. [Judge alter ego] Do you have anything else to add at this point, Jackson? No, your honor, but I'd just like to say, that I'm very sorry this had to happen. I think it's only fair that we hear what the defendant has to say. [Judge alter ego] Very well, the court calls George Manning to the witness stand. (Car mewing) Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, god? Answer me, George Manning. I'm waiting, Manning. This is insanity. Come off it, this isn't a court. Don't you see what you're doing? What you've done? Jackson, listen to me. I mean, look at that picture up there. That's my girl, my oldest. Don't you remember what it was like when you needed your father? Shit, he was never around long enough for me to need. My children need me, Jackson. My family needs me. Is that how you really feel, George? Is that true? Yes. What about last night, George? Why didn't you think about your family then? Jackson, last night had nothing to do with it. You're damn right, it doesn't. Why so much hate? Tell me! Shut up! You'll never understand. The court will now recess to deliberate its verdict. (Thunder roaring) Thank you, George. His choice is how he wants to die. Suffocation? (Laughs) Firing squad? (Laughs) Hanging? (Laughs) Castration? [Donna] Should we drown dad? (Agatha laughing) (Uaughs) Who do I love more, Randy or George? (Agatha laughing) (Brooding music) (Dramatic music) (Phone dial ringing) Oh, don't you, George. (Slap cracking) Nice try, George. We've reached our verdict, George. (Laughs) [Judge alter ego] May I have the envelope, please? Why, yes. (Paper rustling) [Judge alter ego] The court finds the defendant, George Manning, guilty as charged on all counts. It deems him a public menace, and therefore decrees that his life shall be terminated at dawn. Happy birthday. (Agatha laughing) (Thunder rumbling) (Clock ticking) Six more hours, Manning. (Uaughs) (Thunder rumbling) You want some fishy? (Cat mewing) Hi, George. Five more hours, Georgie. Five more hours. (Laughs) (Cat mewing) (Glass smashing) (Uaughs) I'm so happy now, that is so... (Uaughs) You like that, dirty? — oh, come here, George. I saw the records. Good, the stereo's falling down. There goes the telephone. Jackson, do you think we're having an earthquake? Oh, I miss one. Here, Jackson, catch the music box. (Sighs) I missed. (Uaughs) (Clock ticking) I wanna make love to you for the last time. Just a minute. (Donna smooching) George, George. George, oh, George. (Groans) (Vase smashing) They always take the victim thing. (Giggles) (Thunder rumbling) (Playful music) (Wraps rustling) (Agatha munching) (Donna gurgling) (Donna munching) (Donna gurgling) (Agatha munching) (Playful music continues) [Donna] Promises, promises. Trust him, trust him. (Girls laughing) Daddy took advantage. He made me do unspeakable things. (Girls laughing) That's right, your honor. [Agatha] You've been naughty, naughty, naughty, George. Guess more different than you were... (Girls laughing) Fuck you back, back, back, back. Fuck you. Shut up! [Donna] Yes, your honor. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, asshole. Here, go in front of him, go in front of him, go in front of him. [Judge alter ego] Guilty, guilty, guilty as charged. (Fire crackling) (Girls moaning) (Peaceful music) (Girls moaning) (Donna panting) (Fire crackling) (Girls laughing) Three more hours, Manning. (Thunder roaring) (Clock ticking) [Karen] I wouldn't trade my life with you for anything. Trade my life. Trade my life with you. (Girls laughing) (Window knocking) (Brooding music) George, how does it feel to be 40? (Window knocking) (Woman speaking faintly) (Clock ticking) You must suck at it. You better eat because in a little while, you're going on a very long trip. Wake up, George! (Glassware smashing) _ George! (Glrls laughing) George! Georgie! (Glass smashing) (Water gushing) (Statue thudding) (Uaughs) (Footsteps clocking) Sunrise, Manning. (George groaning) (Brooding music) (Girls panting) You're beautiful, you know? Guilty, oh, George, you like my knife? Guilty. No, no! You ready to die, George? Going to. (George groaning) You're ready to die? Get ready for the next life, George! Believe it. (George groaning) (Agatha laughing) Wasn't that funny? (Laughs) You didn't think we were serious, did you, George? You didn't think we were serious? I love you, I love you, I love you. It was just, just a little joke, George. We had so much fun together, George. I still love you, and I wanna be with you. You're different than my daddy, George. George, you're different, George. I'll always remember you, George. It's time to go, darling. (George sobbing) Goodbye, George. Goodbye, George.
