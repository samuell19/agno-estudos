We must allow for practical compromise and feigned ignorance - - which means living with conceptions that - - if consistently followed and thoroughly acknowledged - - would upset our entire existence." Albert Camus MURK Hello? Hello. - Julie? - What's happening? The phone rang. Are you sure? I didn't hear anything. - It rang. - Are you okay? Yeah... Just go back to sleep. Nina, I want to try and fall asleep again, okay? - Hey. - What about the food? Come on. Julie loves sushi. It's not hard to eat. Or to make. My writing was going well and I didn't want to lose my train of thought. Right. Would you bring a tray in? Hi, Julie. - Need some help, Mother? - Hi, honey. Just open the door wide. - May I have a glass of wine? - Yes. - You're a dear. - There you go. - It's so good to see you. - Same here. It's been so long. I don't know where the time goes. How's it going? Fine. Julie hasn't threatened to kill herself for a whole month. So everything's as it should be. What about you? I'm not in immediate danger of committing suicide, either, so... - Cheers. - Cheers. Remember Lars from physical therapy? He was so in love with Julie. He took pills again, but they say he'll survive. He's never been able to figure out how to do things right, either. That's a good one, coming from you! I just have to use the bathroom. It doesn't make sense having a speech therapist - - on exactly the same 2 days. It's too much for Julie. Yes. And for you, too. Where's Julie? How's it going with you and Mother? Okay? I think she's tired. You look tired, too. No, it's... I'm just a little busy, that's all. With the writing and all. How's it going with that guy... Weren't you seeing someone from the physical therapy group? - I don't know if it was Lars... - Peter? - Yeah. - He's cuckoo. He pees in his pants. Are you and Nina going to have kids one of these days? I don't really know... It seems like there's been so much going on. So much what? We have a guest. - Hi, Julie, sweetheart! - Hi. This is Anker - - and this is my brother and his lady. - Nina. - Hi. Anker Jensen. Anker Jensen. Almost the same as our old prime minister. Not that we look like each other. One shouldn't complain all the time. People can do as they please - - but they could save an awful lot of money if they used a professional. How... How did the two of you meet? Maybe that sounds old-fashioned... No, no, no. I understand just what you mean. Julie and I have chatted the past half year and we met a month ago. Chatted? On the net? No, in the old hollow tree in the park. What? Okay, yeah. I just didn't know you chatted, Julie. The county gave her a computer 6 months ago. - I know. I just wasn't aware... - You've been so busy. Jacob and Nina are newspaper journalists for "The Times". Great newspaper. My "Chronicle" always came late so now I subscribe to "The Times". Jacob's on leave of absence at the moment. - How's it going with your book? - Good... It's going well. I've brought something along... Have you ever tried chococcino? It's a special blend. - It's really good, I promise. - I don't know it. Looks delicious. Is it chocolate? There's also something else we want to tell you today. Julie and I want to get married... ...if you think it's okay. We don't know him at all. We can't interfere in Julie's decisions. She's a grown-up woman. She has brain damage. Do you realize how humiliated she feels as it is? Yeah, I know. He's already found them a place. A good little... flat... My little girl... We didn't know, did we? We didn't know she felt so low. She never said anything, either. I think you're right. I think it'll turn out well... for Julie. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Shall we toast the song-writer? - Cheers. Bravo, Marianne. I guess I can't get out of it any longer, so... "Dear Julie. I just want to thank you - - for allowing me to meet you and enter your life. And for allowing me to meet your family who I already feel I know well. I can see that your family really loves you - - and therefore I think it's important that you are with them... ...today. It's important not to be alone - - but to be with those one knows and loves. And, even though we haven't known each other very long - - I truly feel that we know each other well. I feel that I know you, in any case. Perhaps even better than you think. Sometimes, anyway. I hope I can be as you'd like me to be. I hope I don't disappoint you." I... don't have so much else to say, other than... Julie... Thank you. Thank you for letting me get to know you. I love you... Julie. - Did they leave? - She was tired. They wanted to rest. - Are you doing alright? - Yes, of course. Would you give this to Anker? It's his camera. - You're staying the night, aren't you? - Yes. What's happening? Hello? - It rang. - Jacob... I think something's wrong. Julie! Julie! Rikke Marlene Bjerre 1972 - 2002 Thank you for everything Julie Hvidtoft 1973 - 2004 Thank you fo everything Rikke Marlene Bjerre 1972 - 2002 Thank you for everything A-N-K-E-R. Anker Jensen. No, he doesn't live at that address anymore. I think he lives in Jutland now. You don't have anything? Okay. Thank you. Hi, darling. - Hi. - What are you doing? It sure is dark here. That cell phone number Anker gave us doesn't exist. Information doesn't have anything, either. What do you need his number for? Anker didn't have any sisters or brothers, did he? This reminds me of your old days at the paper. - He didn't, did he? - He basically had no family. He had an aunt who he fell out with. She wasn't at the wedding, in any case. Why? Look at this. It was in a book that Anker forgot to take with him. - And so? - Take a look. He's the one who wanted to put - - "Thanks for everything" in Julie's death announcement. Is that why you want to find him? Anker left pretty fast after the funeral. Yes. But he was crushed, you know. We didn't exactly gate-crash all the time. Claus still really wants you to start working at the newspaper again. - Why not talk to them? - I'm trying to finish my book. It's taking so long. Maybe it would be good to do something else - - and get things moving again. What are you saying? That it's taking time? That it's not going fast enough? Is it going too slow, or what? Forget about Julie and "get things moving again"? - That's not what I mean at all. - Then don't say it! I understand that it's difficult. Two times. That's two times where I didn't do anything. You couldn't live her life for her. What could you have done, darling? What's the newspaper's telephone number? It's ringing. Claus Petersen, please. Hi, Claus, it's Jacob Hvidtoft. Hi... I was wondering if you could help me. Do you have access to the address-change register? Yeah? An Anker Jensen. Here's his previous address... Don't do anything stupid now, okay? I just want to talk with him. See you tomorrow. ANKER JENSEN 8 DROSSEL ROAD, 8544 M?RKE You can drive all the way up. - What? - I said you can drive all the way up. Right. - Who are you looking for? - Oh, I'm... I'm looking for a guy called Anker. Do you know if he lives here? - Anker? - Yes. Yes, he's moving in right now. - Really? - Come. Anker? Maybe he's gone into town for supplies. He's doing some renovating. Hi, Anker. Hi, Jacob. What... What are you doing here? Hi, Karl. - Your cell phone doesn't work. - What? That number you gave us doesn't work. Oh, that's right. I have a new one. - So... we couldn't contact you. - No, I understand. Oh, you forgot this. - It was with some of Julie's things. - Okay. So you have mutual friends? Hi. Wait... Hi, Anker. You're going to have to look at that motor. It stalled twice. Hi. Who are you? He's an old friend from Copenhagen. This is Jacob - - and this is Sonja, Hanne's sister. - And this is Hanne. - Hi, Jacob. I didn't know you invited anybody, Anker. - Well... - Such a good-looking guy, too. You've come all this way for our wedding? Can you drive me back, Anker? I bought some things at the flea market. - Yes. - I can take you. - Are you heading towards town? - No, but it doesn't matter. What about you, Jacob? Are you driving towards town? - Yes. - Good. - See you later. - Yeah. - See you, Anker. - Okay. Get started on that barn! When are they getting married? On... On Saturday. It has sure happened pretty fast. Isn't there a saying? "He who hesitates..."? Or... "If you hesitate..." Oh, well. It slipped my mind. One shouldn't, in any case. Hesitate, that is. And... ...whose farm is it? Did Anker buy it? It was my parents'. I inherited it. I was going to sell it, but then that happened to Hanne. So Hanne and I moved in. And now she's just living there with Anker. Are you a journalist? Yes. Where does Anker know someone like you from? He knew my sister. I live there. You can just stop here. - Can you manage? - Sure. - Do you live here? - No, no. Yes... It's Karl's, the local constable. But he doesn't like to be called that. He's the policeman you met before. I'm sub-letting it. It's just temporary, until I move back to Aarhus and finish my studies. Well, thanks for the ride. - See you on Saturday? - Yes. On Saturday. Are you staying at the inn? Yes, I'd planned to. - Bye-bye. - Bye. - Nina speaking. - Anker's getting married again. Really? That was quick. She's handicapped. I want you to do something for me. Check the archives for a death announcement in the name of Bjerre - - between the 13th and 20th of April, 2002. - Jacob... - What if it was him? What if it was Anker? And he's done it before? If you think something's wrong you better go to the police. Aren't you coming home now, Jacob? Won't you please come home? Call me when you've got something, okay? Excuse me. The door was open. - May I come in for a moment? - Yes. I loved Julie. I did. I understand if you think it's a little strange - - that I... That I... I already... I also told Hanne it was a bit fast. But she needs help. She needs me and I need her. We're not good at being alone. No, I was just wondering... I never found out what happened. When Julie locked herself in the bathroom... ...where were you? Were you downstairs or in the room next door? I was next door. And you didn't hear anything or wonder what was taking so long? I had drunk a little too much. And... I'd fallen asleep. I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive myself. I want you to know that, Jacob. - Just a second... - Sure. I think it's best if you go home again. It will only confuse Hanne. I hope you understand. I do. - Hi. - Hi. - Shall I help you? - No, it's not so heavy. I need to talk to you. We need silverware for three courses. - Everything should be there. - Thanks. - Anker was married to my sister. - I know. He told me. She committed suicide on their wedding night. - It must have been awful for you. - I found this. It was among Anker's things. Who's that? I don't know. You don't know who she is? I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you're trying to say. It's strange that Anker knew two girls and they both died. It's strange my parents died in a traffic accident - - and what happened to Hanne. But I've quit wondering about it. I just want to get on with my life, but that's hard to do in this fucking dump. Would you mind helping me with this? I think I understand how you feel. You've been through some really horrible things. I think it's obvious that Anker really loves her. I don't know what you're thinking, but if you suspect that he... I simply refuse to believe it. Hanne's brain damage sometimes makes her a little paranoid. If someone said they suspected him, who knows how she'd react. Do you understand? Yes. I think you should forget about all this and go back home. For your own sake, too. Great, Karl. There's just this. "Dear Nina I love you. I wish I could..." - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. Is Anker in? - No, he just left. - How about a cup of coffee? - Yes. Of course. - Come in. - Thank you. - I just have to turn off the water. - Of course. Are you just about ready for the big day? Yes, I think so. Sonja's almost finished sewing my gown. I can't really sew anymore. I never was much good at it. This is moccaccino. It's a special blend. Anker and I love it. - It looks good. - Yes. How did you and Anker meet? On the internet. The county authorities gave me a computer. And Sonja showed me how to chat, and... ...it was great. Do you want some chocolate milk? That's okay, I have this. So it was his idea to come over here? I don't really remember. Maybe it was Sonja's idea. It's not that he's so good looking... ...but he seemed awfully nice. And Sonja liked him, too. I usually only meet... you know... handicapped people - - and that's not really for me. Don't you think he's nice, too? - Yes... May I have a little more? - Yes. I have some questions, but you don't have to answer them. We don't know each other very well, but... Why did you attempt suicide... that time? But I was run over by a car. You were run over? Yes. I was biking home from a party - - and was wearing my reflector tabs but the motorist didn't see me. He was drunk and had just gotten his driver's license. It was up on the main road. I can't really remember anything. But I almost died. I was lucky. Sonja says so, too. I was prettier than Sonja once. - You're still very pretty, Hanne. - Do you really think so? Yes, I sure do. Hanne... - Hi. - Hi. Look, I have a visitor. It's Jacob. We have to go to physical therapy in half an hour. Yes. I'll just change clothes. Would you mind coming out to the barn with me? Jacob... This... was lying in the bathroom. It's from Julie. She... I think she'd planned to do it all along. "There is no one who can help me. There is no one who will. You may think you're helping... ...but you're not. I have always been alone - - and I never meet anyone who loves me. At the most, someone... ...who feels sorry for me. You'd have preferred to be rid of me - - because I couldn't do anything and was an inconvenience. So, goodbye. You won't miss me - - and I won't miss you." They say that most suicides are... That, in reality, one is trying to hurt those left behind. I think maybe she didn't know, herself... ...that she did it in a way that would hit everyone the hardest. I hid the letter. There was no reason why the rest of you should read it. But that was wrong. I shouldn't have. I'm sorry, Anker, I... Try looking at yourself and find someone who isn't! Loser! I didn't do it! I swear to God! Now I'm gonna... Don't you want a whisky, sheriff? No, I think you'd better sleep it off. What are you doing? Don't do it... Don't. Do you have any kids, sheriff? No. And if you call me sheriff again, I'll throw you out the window. My father bought a top-floor condominium - - when me and my sister were kids. Julie and I went to see it. We were standing on his balcony and my father said: "It's hard living so high up when one always feels like jumping." Why the hell did he want to say something like that? I was scared stiff, but do you know what my sister said? She was only eleven. She said: "I think you should do it. If that's what you want." My father just stood there with his mocking smile. He didn't like her. Then she took my hand and we left. Away from his shitty apartment. And he never did it. In spite of all that suicide talk and moaning. He wound up in the cancer ward, whining - - clinging to life and getting all of us to come and hold his hand - - and wipe his ass, whereas Julie... ...she did it. She went down to the harbor... and jumped in. Do you have any idea how cold that water must have been? And how lonely she must have felt? I'd really understand if she thought we'd let her down. And if that clown wasn't already dead by then, I'd have killed him. Fucking sissy. I'm leaving now, Jacob. Make sure you get a good night's sleep before you leave tomorrow. Hi, Jacob. Hi, Anker. - Do you want to come in? - No, I... I was wondering if you'd like to be my best man tomorrow. - Best man? - Yes. I don't have one and we've gotten to know each other a bit. It's nice of you to ask, but... I think I'd rather go home. Are you sure? Hanne and I think it would be great. No, I have to go home. Really? Sure, of course... - Best of luck with everything. - Yes, but... Then I'll see you around one day. Hello... "...and I can see that your family really loves you." Would you give this to Anker? MORPHINE TABLETS 30 MG GRETHE & HARALD JENSEN 1927/1923 - 1998 Thank you for everything WEDDING I'll just bring the chairs in first. Anker? I'm coming now. It's a shame your family couldn't be here. But today you become an official member of our family - - to which you'll always belong. Let us all rise and give a toast. Hip, hip, hurrah! I guess I can't get out of it any longer. Dear Rikke. I want to thank you for allowing me to meet you and enter your life. And for allowing me to meet your family - - who I already feel I know well. It's important not to be alone - - but be together with those one knows and loves. I guess I can't get out of it any longer. Dear Julie. I just want to thank you for allowing me to meet you - - and enter your life. - You will, really? - Yes. I thought you'd gone home. It may be a good way to round things off so I can get on with my life. I'm really glad to hear it. Won't you come in and have a moccaccino? No, I'd better find myself a tuxedo. - I'll see you early tomorrow, okay? - Yes, of course. - I'll see you later, then. - Yes, bye. Well... I guess I can't get out of it any longer. "Dear Hanne. I just want to thank you for allowing me to meet you - - and for allowing me to meet your family. And, even though things have moved a little fast... ...I think we already know each other very well." I love you, Hanne. Thank you for wanting to be mine... So it's here you're hiding. Yeah. It's nice of you to show Anker that you're okay with all this. Of course I am. I think Karl feels you're a little dangerous. Are you? I don't know about that. Now you and I are gonna dance, dammit! Don't take offence, but you're a really bad dancer. - I think it's my turn now. - Yes, it sure is. I'd like to have a little chat with you. - What? - Come with me. What the hell do you want? What are you doing here, Jacob? - What do you mean? - Why are you here? It's a wedding, isn't it? I've been checking up on you. It appears you had problems with the authorities a few years ago. What? Your sister attempted suicide 3 years ago, and you beat up her boyfriend. - He wasn't her boyfriend... - You blamed it on him. He was the one who found her and saved her, too. Listen! He wasn't her boyfriend. He was a psychopath. - Psychopath? - Yeah. Just like Anker? Do you think Anker deserves a beating, too? He was married to your sister when she committed suicide. - You must really hate him. - You don't know shit. I know... ...that you'd better relax. I saw you at the bar getting more and more angry. - Don't make any trouble. - What are you talking about? It's been hard enough on Sonja. She needs to get on with her life. Hanne, too. They need peace now, and you're not going to spoil it. This is all about you wanting Sonja and getting Hanne out of the way. Am I right, sheriff? Behave yourself or else you'll have to deal with me. Got it? - Have you seen Anker and Hanne? - No, I haven't. Do you know where Anker and Hanne are? Have you seen Anker and Hanne? - Has anyone seen Anker and Hanne? - What's with you, Jacob? I think Anker's going to kill Hanne. He's going to fucking kill her! - Okay, Jacob. Time to go home. - I'm talking to Sonja! - Didn't I tell you to behave? - You have to listen to me... Stop it, Karl! Anker's going to kill her! Get out of here! Rikke Bjerre, that dead girl whom I asked you about... She was also married to Anker. He killed them. He's insane! - We've got to find them now! - You little shit! The Copenhagen police didn't believe him, either. He's a psychopath! Stop it, god dammit! Karl, stop! Stop! I think they're over in the house. Where is she? Where is she? Hanne! - Where is Hanne? - She's in there. - Hanne? Hanne! - Jacob... - What are you doing? - Hanne? - Karl! - That's enough! Go home. You need help. Hello? Hello? Who is this? - Is it you, Hanne? - Hi, Jacob. I was wondering... if you'd come out here? I think it's better if I go home. I should very much like you to come. I'm feeling a little... strange. - Hanne? - I'm in here. Pardon me. I'll wait out here. It's okay. Anker just left but I think he'll be back soon. I'm sorry that I... spoiled your wedding. You thought Anker killed your sister? Yes. Did you have a bad conscience? I'm sure you did. Sonja feels guilty about me, too. She never said so, but I can feel it. We couldn't understand it the first time my sister tried to commit suicide. Or maybe we did. But when she survived - - and we saw she'd never be the same, we thought... ...maybe it would have been better... ...if she'd succeeded the first time. I thought of telling her I would help her. I'd sit with her, holding hands so she wouldn't be alone like the first time. But I never did. Instead, I said nothing. Why didn't you? Because... I think I was afraid. Of what? Of... There's a certain kind of person who... carries death around... ...with him. I think one is afraid of that. Because you don't want that person to contaminate you. And then you convince yourself you've made an agreement - - without having said anything - - to leave each other alone. - Are you angry with me? - No, why? Why should I be? I remember I was standing by the road and I was unhappy - - because of some guy. And I missed Mom and Dad. And you couldn't be bothered to fetch me. Then there was a car coming. And I took a little step into the road. Just a little, tiny step. Maybe you knew it was me. We've just never talked about it. But it doesn't matter. What could you have done? Hey! Here come Mom and Dad. Hanne... Don't! No! Don't! Don't! Hanne? Hanne? Hanne! No! It's alright, it's alright... What do they say? Sonja? They've put her in a respirator. Her heart stopped for a couple of minutes. They think she'll survive - - but they don't know if she's suffered more brain damage. I'm sorry. I told you to go home. I told you the other day. - This is your fault. - Come on, let's sit down. I'd like to have a word with you. I want to go through the sequence of events once more. Is it true that Hanne called you about 9 o'clock and asked you to come - - but no one let you in when you got there, so you went in, anyway? Yes. You found Hanne in the bathtub with her wrists cut - - after which you pulled her out of the bathtub. Yes... Yes. Have I left anything out? I talked with her. You talked while Hanne was lying in the tub with her wrists cut? Yes. She didn't seem to realize what had happened. She looked surprised. What did you talk about? - About Hanne's first suicide attempt. - What suicide attempt? That time out on the main road. Hanne was hit by a car? It was an accident, Jacob. Go back to your hotel and rest. We want you to spend the night in case there are more questions. This is Nina's voice mail. You know what to do. Hi, Nina, it's Jacob. I just want to say... I'm coming home tomorrow... I mean... I'm sorry about everything... But I'm looking forward to coming home to you. I love you... Okay? - Where do you think you're going? - Home. The room on the left. Just sit down, Jacob. December 7th. Time, 09:40. Interrogation of Jacob Hvidtoft - - in connection with Hanne Nielsen's suicide attempt. Present are Sgt. Karl Unmack and Inspector Peter Hjort. Jacob. You're here because there are some things we need cleared up. I've told you what happened. Some new information has turned up that we'll have to investigate. What information? How'd you get those scratches on your face? Hanne's nails scratched me when I tried to pull her out of the bathtub. Sonja says she heard her yell just before she came in and found you. Yes, but... Hanne seemed very distant. She was talking about her parents like she'd forgotten what she'd done. According to Sonja, she yelled, "Don't!". What the hell's going on? Sonja says it was as though Hanne was crying for help. When she came in, you had Hanne in your arms - - but it was only when you saw Sonja that you tried to save her life. Sonja doesn't know what she's saying. She's in shock. She's trying to make sense of it. Traces of morphine were found in Hanne's blood. And we can't find the knife or razor blade she used on her wrists. There are parts of your statement that we wonder about. Plus your behavior. At the wedding, among other things. I came to try to save her. - From what? - From Anker. Why? Because I thought he'd kill her. You thought he killed your sister and now he was going to kill Hanne? - Yes. - He wasn't. - No. - Did that make you mad? - What? - That your suspicions made no sense? No. Weren't you relieved that Anker wasn't a murderer? I don't know. Yes, I was. Did you try to kill Hanne, Jacob? No, listen... - She'll tell you when she wakes up. - If she wakes up. If she wakes up she probably won't remember what happened. Unfortunately, that's quite normal. But you're aware of that. Is there nothing you wish to say? I'm informing you we're keeping you for 24 hours while we investigate - - and that you may face questioning before a judge. May I have your belt and shoe laces? We're in the vicinity. Call us if you need anything. - Karl... Come with me. - Just wait here, Jacob. - You can go home now. - What happened? Did Hanne wake up? According to the prosecutor, there isn't enough evidence to keep you. - And a letter has turned up. - A letter? A suicide note written by Hanne. The officer will take you to collect your things. Come on! BATTERY LEVEL LOW This is Nina's voice mail. You know... Fuck! Fucking! Hi, Jacob. Hi. - Need some help? - No... My car just won't start. You don't have a telephone, do you? Of course. Jump in. Something's wrong with the telephone. Well. This happens sometimes. The wiring's kind of faulty. Try again in a little while. Want a moccaccino? Yes, thanks. - You can also have some bread. - No. Thanks, anyway. They say there's a good chance Hanne will make it. That's good news. When I was married the first time, I really thought it was for life. That I'd found the one I'd spend the rest of my life with. After the years with my parents... All the time I'd cared for them where they got sicker and sicker. After that, it was hard for me to be around others. But it wasn't that way with her. We understood each other. Even though we couldn't be together, you know... like that. Because of her accident. But it didn't matter. Because it wasn't like that. We really understood each other. We knew we were going to marry a couple of months after we met. It was really a beautiful wedding. She seemed so happy. During the course of the evening she said she wanted to rest awhile. So I wheeled her to her room. She said I should go back to the party. So I did. Later, when I went to look in on her - - she was lying dead in the bathtub. While I stood looking at her I tried to remember things she'd said. Maybe she had hinted at what she was going to do. But, do you know what? I couldn't remember anything at all. Nothing. But I understood, anyway. I understood why she did it when she did. And why she had to do it alone. For you know what? One doesn't speak about death. That's what makes it so hard. Was there no one in Rikke's family who suspected anything, either? Rikke? No, no. My first wife's name was Helle. Rikke came later. I loved her, too, but in another way. I wondered what you really wanted when you first showed up. You seemed very angry. I've never experienced that before. It made everything really difficult. I realized I couldn't help Hanne during the wedding - - so I had to do everything differently. You're the one who suffered as a result. Hanne, too. I thought you'd sit with her... and hold her hand. You... You gave Hanne morphine... ...and put her in the bathtub. And you knew that I'd come. Anker... You can't take that responsibility. You can't know if they want to die. You don't ask yourself when you need help, do you? - You killed Julie. - But she was completely alone. Having the knowledge and the power... ...to do what people want... ...that they're unable to talk about... ...is both a blessing and a curse. To be together with them - - so they're not so lonely while it's happening. Can you imagine anything more lonely than death? We have a lot in common. Our intentions are the same. I know why you came. I know why you searched for me the way you did. You needn't say anything. I have the power, and I won't let you down. One must choose. That's what we're going to do now. And we're not alone, Jacob. Thanks for everything. Hi, darling. What... What happened? You're in the hospital. Anker... Anker's dead, Jacob. I really miss Julie. I'm sorry if I didn't say anything. I'm sorry if I didn't tell you how I was feeling. I should have known. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Don't let go of me. - I'll never let go of you. It should be okay now. The spark plug cable had been removed. - We'd better get going. - Do you mind driving? Take care. Have a safe trip home, Jacob. Subtitles: Steve Schein Dansk Video Tekst
