[intense music] Man 1: Oh, thanks. Here are the keys. [indistinct chatter] What? What? Clinton: Sheila! [chatter continues] Goddamnit! Come on! We got a party here, damn it! Sheila! Sheila, come on back! Now where the hell are you going? Sorry, Marty. No, no, no, she's alright. [engine revving] [crickets chirping] [tires screeching] [clattering] [tires screeching] [screams] [door slams] [tires screeching] [instrumental music] [typewriter keys clacking] [music continues] [clacking continues] [music continues] Man on TV: He was my friend. No, he-- he was my friend. - But he was a nice man. - Tom? - I don't want it now. - Are you alright? I don't want it. Guess what? Your father has had his body defrosted into life, and he wants this house back. Almost. Clinton requests our attendance on his yacht for a week. No kidding? Oh, God. Oh, God! Could it be? Could it be? I wouldn't count on it, no, I think he's just bored and wants to play parlor games. But we'll go anyway. Ever the dreamer. - Give me a sip of that. - It's ginger ale. Do you want one? Tom, write something new. Forget "Freak Show." Clinton's never gonna produce it. And he's never going to give it back to you. Tom: Probably. [instrumental music] [chuckles] Okay. Who else besides me? Yeah. Both of them or just him? Oh, that's good. No way. Yeah, well, who else is coming? Well, that's different. Of course, I'll come. We've been dying to sign her for months. Hello? It's a bad connection here. I said I have been dying to see you for months! Listen, what about Bridey Murphy? Is she coming? What do you mean what do I mean? This is the same B-group that was in your house the night Sheila got bounced to the hedges. Yeah, well, I'm giving it to Joyce Haber "Clinton Greene's Anniversary Wake." That's what I said. It's not right for Haber. Okay, we'll just keep it our secret instead. Listen, I loved your... That's a piece of dreck. I loved your wire and I can't wait to see you, really. I mean, I've lost 50 pounds. I'm a hollow reed. Kiss, kiss. Call Haber and give her the dish. Disguise your voice as a woman. "My year of mourning being over." Is he kidding? I mean, we went directly to Streisand's opening at The Sands right from the cemetery. Get me Freddie, will you? Freddie, I wanna go to South France, honey. [instrumental music] Settle down, please, everyone! Thank you. Now, girls, shall we try? Big smiles, everyone. - Elizabeth. - Britain's best bow-wows... - Bark! - For Buffers. - Very good... - Phone, Mr. Dexter. It's your wife. Yes, darling? From whom? Oh, good God! - Bark! Bark! - When? Very good. Well, send a confirming telegram from both of us. Very well, then, from me. Darling, I must hang up now. One of my cast is peeing on my leg. Something Garbo never did, even at her moodiest. Bye, now. Sorry. Alright, everyone off. Once again, please. Now animation. Wave the little tins. Ready. Go! [instrumental music] No, no that's it, that's it. You ready, darling? - Yes. - Ready, gentlemen? Ready! - Man 2: Do you enjoy Rome, love? - Do I! I enjoy Rome for countless reasons. Man 3: Why do you leave? Well, I've just finished my picture starring Kirk Douglas and I'm exhausted. - And the heat. - Man 4: Where do you go? Um, for a week on the yacht of a famous producer. But I'm not afraid. My husband will be there to protect me. That's right, but I'm afraid our plane will leave without us. If you gentlemen will excuse us. No, no, grazie- [indistinct chatter] Senor, senor- - Senor, senor - No! No! No! Oh, I'm fine! He didn't mean anything. You don't do commercials for liquor companies. Why can't we just go on a vacation like normal people? [instrumental music] Let's board. Don't want to leave the luggage, and I ain't carrying it three feet. Is your back okay? [chuckles] Yeah, so far. Well, I pray it stays that way and that Clinton stays in a good mood. Where is everybody? You don't think they're below playing sardines or something, do you? Tommy: I'll bet Clinton's got games planned for every day. Lee: Just as long as he sticks to the days and leaves us some nights for ourselves. Hey! Tommy! Lee! It's a mistake! Hey, so what do you think, gang, huh? Thrilled, pleased, disappointed? It's fabulous, Clinton. - I didn't know you were coming. - You're thrilled about it. - I can tell. - I'm delighted. Clinton can take his frustrations out on you. Yeah, but you know he's always sorry afterwards. - How are you, Tom? - Hey, CG. - Hi, how was your flight? - Flight was good. Alright, people. Let's line up by the prow. - What is this, a pogrom? - Now, come on. When do you wish to sail, Signor Greene? When do I wish to sail? Let's get out of this joint tout de suite- - Totally dry. - Alright, gang. Let's line up right here. Husbands and wives separate, uh... Lee, between Alice and Anthony. Right in here. That's right. Ah-ha! Philip, you there. Christine. Tom, on the other side of Christine. There! Left profile, darling. [speaking in foreign language] He's Italian. I took the wrong three weeks at Berlitz. All I know is scusi and pronto. Pronto will be enough. Alright, now let's smile, or whatever you people do for a living. Take that hat off, Christine. Alright, now squeeze in closer. Come on, come on, squeeze in close or you'll be out of the picture. And I don't mean this one. Perfect! A study of six hungry failures. Just kidding, gang. He'll watch his mouth when you sign with me. When's lunch? Come on, people. Vittorio will show you your cabin. I hate my luggage more than life. - Whose is this? - That's ours. Vuitton from rewriting spaghetti westerns? - What's Vuitton? - Good. - Oh! - Wowie! Who did this room, Parker Brothers? [Clinton chuckles] Sometimes it rains, you know-- - What's the scoreboard for? - Ah, well, that's for later. [clattering] Whoops, uh... [clears throat] Sorry. Oh, that's alright. That's what they're for. It's only Sheila's favorite. [indistinct chatter] Alright. Everybody... down to the latrines for a shave, shower, or douche, depending on your hang-up. Tom: I think it's fabulous, Clinton. This is the bathroom. - You like it? - Oh, it's really beautiful. What, uh, period would you say it was, Clinton? Louis XXXIV. Come on, gang, let's get this show on the road. Oh, it's fabulous, Clinton. Absolutely fabulous. - It's like your mother's. - It's like our maid's. Tom, Lee, you have to share a John. Get to know each other. Philip. Come on, love. Let's try it out. What do you got for me, something special? - Yes. - Can't wait to see it. Oh, I love it! But where does the crew sleep? Look, Alice and Anthony got the double because he didn't want her sulking for six days. Because he knew you wouldn't sulk. Everything with Clinton is points. Understand? Points. - Do you understand? - Too well. I don't mind Clinton, you know. I just don't want him running our lives. Ah, wonderful, Anthony and Alice have brought their cassette player. [knock on door] - Bottled water? - Cabin-o five-o, capice? Cabin-o five-o. Nice little ass, but I think he's afraid of me. Now, what do you think we're doing here? - Oh, you're here, too. - Clinton's project. - Mm-hm, which is? - Which is? Well, he's been hinting about making a picture on the life and death of Sheila Greene. [scoffs] That is truly bizarre. No, not really. She's still a compulsive subject with Clinton. But he never really cared about her. Oh, yes, he did. He cared about her very much. He cared very much about her Arizona real estate holdings which we are sailing on right now. Finding the guy who hit her is just another game with Clinton. Absolutely. But what a game. And now Tom gets to write it, Philip gets to direct it, and what's her face, I mean, uh, my new client, Miss Alice Wood gets to thrill you as Sheila Greene, who rose from call girl to columnist. [laughing] Listen, just do me this. Minutes from now, when Clinton talks about this and he will, just be surprised. [laughing] Well, I'm thinking of calling it... Don't be shocked now. "The Last of Sheila." [chuckling] Clinton: Fox is interested, Paramount is interested. It's the perfect woman's picture. Every bit as big as "Love Story." Except she never gets to play that good hospital scene. Well, Clinton, I think it's the picture we've been waiting for. If we're available, of course. Yeah, well, provided they're not opening a new shopping center in Anaheim, you will be. Ah! Two hours to game time, gang. Let me describe the week's entertainment for you. The last time I played a game was charades at-- At my house, year ago, the night Sheila was killed. As a matter of fact, everyone here was-- Was there. Except Lee. You were home sick in Santa Barbara, you said. Uh, no, I was home sick of Santa Barbara, I said. I like any game where you don't have to move. Well, you don't have to for this one, if you're smart enough. Philip: Meaning? Well, it's sort of... I call it "The Sheila Greene Memorial Gossip Game." Sounds fascinating. And I haven't even described it yet. - No, I couldn't. I'm stuffed. - Now, I've dreamed up odds-- Can't you take a joke? Come here. Pay attention, please. Now, I dreamed up six secrets, one for each of you. Six little pretend pieces of gossip. Now keep them secret. Give me, give me. Lee: Can we look at them? Clinton: It'll help. Anthony: How do you think these things up? Clinton: Well, this one's only taken me a month to prepare, "He said modestly." [Anthony chuckling] It's marvelous. Christine: It's what I've always wanted to be. It says, "You are a snoop." No, no, no, don't throw it away. Keep them till Saturday. And don't show them. Anybody who wants to peek at mine gets a kiss. What's the game? Well, the idea is to discover everybody's secret without peeking, of course, and prevent the other players from discovering yours. Christine: And how do we do that? Well, every day, we'll park in a different port where you can discover the proof of one person's secret. I'll announce what secret it is to look for and give you a clue which will tell you what to do and where to go on shore. Now, if you solve the clue properly, it'll lead you to where the proof is. Now, suppose you announce, let's say, "Pyromaniac." And let's say that's my secret. Why should I bother looking for the proof? Because when the person whose secret it is discovers the proof, I'll put a card out saying the game for that evening is over. And those who haven't found it don't score, right? Right, oh, if you could direct as fast as you catch on to games you'd never be a has-been again. - What do we get if we win? - Better billing. - Let's play! - Ah! According to the old pizza stinger that runs this tub for me the launch will be back to pick you up at 7:00 p.m. That's when you'll get your clue for this evening. For whom are we looking tonight? The person with the shoplifter card. Vittorio! [engine revving] Christine: Alright, who's got the shoplifter card? Oh, come on, fellas, we're not gonna really do this, are we? Run around this bombed-out backwater with a silver key up our tuchus? This probably means that you're the shoplifter. Is this the only clue we're gonna get? - It must open a door somewhere. - Brilliant. Tom: Oh, it's a game. I thought you were going to enjoy it. Vittorio, honey, I wanna talk to you. - If we're playing... - Hey, stop. Clinton: Stop coming on to Vittorio, Christine. He doesn't know what the key means any more than you do. It's my secret. Everybody got their key? Huh? Vittorio will be back to pick you up again at 10 o'clock sharp. Now, be on the docks by that time or you'll have to swim back to the boat through the oil slick and the beer cans. And no conferring. This is an individual competition. Oh, quit pouting, Alice. You're having a terrific time. [engine revving] Kill. [indistinct chatter] [speaking in foreign language] Don't hate me. I followed you. Hey, look, I know it's against the rules, but really we could knock this off together. You know, actually, I speak a little frog. Just don't tell Clinton I did it, okay? [speaking in foreign language] [indistinct chatter] Look at this chintzy toast rack. Maybe it's a letter holder. What do you think? I think Steve and Eydie would love it. How much is it, this thing? Ninety francs. Nine... What is that? Ninety divided by five? [speaking in foreign language] - Merci- - Are you kidding? That is $18. I think that's outrageous... Where'd she go? Lee! [sirens wailing] I'd very much like to be allowed to compare this key with the keys of your rooms, if that's alright with you. [speaking in foreign language] Hey, Lee, what did you find? Lee, wait for me! - What did you find? - Oh! I'll give you a hint. The word in French for key is cle. C-L-E-F. Get it? [chuckling] Hey, d-- don't tell Clinton I told you, okay? Lee! Lee! I never saw that one before. She's probably a war baby. [speaking in foreign language] Tsk! [indistinct chatter] [speaking in foreign language] I knew this hotel was an at-cay ouse-hay. It's the same key that whore had on the corner. Which corner, madam? [lock clicks] [indistinct gunfire on TV] [indistinct chatter on TV] [door creaks] - Don't touch the dummy, dummy. - Jesus. Just figure out what happened and get your buns out of here before one of the other dodos comes in. Alright. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Well, obviously, this is the shoplifter's room. Everything still has a price tag on it. Yawn. And, uh, this is a detective whom he's killed. And, uh, this bottle of perfume is a clue to the shoplifter's identity. Do you move your lips when you read? Uh, uh, perfume, uh, scent, uh, money. Uh, no, no, um, French money is francs, not cents, uh... Chan... Oh! Chanel No. 5. [chuckling] Very good, Clinton. Very good. [indistinct chatter on TV] Man on TV: Here are all the known photographs of the brutal shoplifter who has terrified the sniveling merchants of the Riviera for the past 20 years. Here is the only head shot taken by Bruno of Hollywood. Ah, Clinton, I'm dazzled! Closed circuit? What did you think it was, black magic? Is this it? Oh, my God! What is that? No, don't get your hopes up, darling, it's not our host, he's standing behind the door. You go play pinball machines. - Have fun. - Now, now. See you at 10:00. [singing in foreign language] Hi. - You get it? - Unh-unh. Not yet. Well, I could give you a hint. Unh-unh, I want to figure this one out all by myself. [singing continues] You seem a little worried. You okay? I'm fine. Go on, get out of here, you shoplifter. Man on TV: Here is the only headshot taken by Bruno of Hollywood. Well, I found the proof. - What now? - We get out of here. Ketchup's beginning to attract silverfish. [singing in foreign language] - Ooh! Don't hit me. - No, no, no. Thank God you speak French. Listen. D-- did you, uh, you did get fixed up with one of the go-go boys in there, did you? - Are you kidding me? - Mm. Are you... I spent the last hour ditching guys who thought I was offering them the key to my hotel room. Hotel. Hey, fellows, I got the key, I knew it would... [instrumental music] Any of you guys belong to a '57 Dodge pickup truck? Oh, shit! [singing in foreign language] Not here for God's sake. Everybody's walking around. Listen. I wanna see you tonight. I'd like to talk to you. It's about this game. I know we said we'd be careful, but I don't think anybody will be on the top deck. I mean late. Hi, bunny. You mean there's no such thing as 18-karat silver? No, gold, my dear. Only gold. If I'd been thinking more clearly I wouldn't have wasted 15 minutes in some masseuse's apartment while she showed me her scrapbooks from World War ll. - Is it your back? - Yes. All that running around. Alright, Brownie troop, I just wanna ask you two questions. - Who solved it, and how many? - Didn't you, sweetie? Hey, no talking about the game. Oh, I'll be more into it tomorrow night. You'd better be, honey, or Sandra Dee will be playing Sheila. [instrumental music] [loud music on stereo] - Terrific! - Go tell them to turn it down. Are you mad? I'm not gonna play housemother to those two. Ah! Alone at last. Not while Clinton's al... Good Lord. I was gonna say not while Clinton's on board and it came out "Not while Clinton's alive." Boy, you don't forgive easy. I've lived around Clintons all my life, starting with daddy, that same hearty way of bringing people to their knees and then, handing out little presents. Like this job. Alice: Why are you doing this? Anthony: Come on. She wants a bigger bed. [chuckling] Point noted. Come over here. Let's forget Clinton for a while. And starlight filled the corners of the room. You're an incurable romantic. Oh, it's curable. Clinton: I swear to God, I'm not. That's it. Now, what's that all about? Hey, turn off your questing mind for a while. Alice: We went through a shuffle at the model agency, and I was broke. Jean wasn't keeping me anymore, and I don't know suddenly I just got this urge to take something, anything. Oh, I told myself it was because I was broke but... really, it was just this urge. So I ripped off a leopard coat. Big brown buttons and slash pockets. Poor thing. But, of course, I got caught. "Would you please accompany me to the manager's office?" They said. And you know who got me out of it? No, scratch that. We know how jealous you get, don't we? Anyway, I got bailed out and nobody knew. But nobody knew me then. That's why I was so out of it tonight. Clinton swore to me it was just a coincidence, but... you see, it's not just me. Look, darling. You see? And I thought of you. And I thought that Clinton's got something on each of us. He's just mixed up the cards, that's all. It's rotten. But I'd like to know what the others are. I wonder what he's got for Anthony. That's the thing about secrets. We all know stuff about each other, we just don't know the same stuff. How did he find out? Sheila, probably. Have you got the shoplifter card? That'd be ironic. You won't tell. What card do you have? Hm? Now how are you going to get through this trip without jumping on my bones and eating me alive, hm? What card do you have? Please? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Please. Is she still upset? What? Oh! - Talk about a body. - Please don't. Oh! She's looking upset again. That's because she doesn't like games. - She always loses. - Will you stop it? Why don't you go down the hall and get yourself a job? Oh, you're so mean to me. Isn't she mean to me? Oh! Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo. [crying] Boo-hoo! Oh, Jesus. [shower running] [gargling] Oh, you started without me. [Clinton laughs] [clock ticking] [sighs] [instrumental music] Lee, my darling. What're you doing out here at this ungodly hour? Have I ever told you how sweet you were to me when I was a child? Nothing could've been simpler. No, I mean it. At daddy's legendary Sunday lunches. I can still see you on Olivia de Havilland's lap. It's funny, you know, she was one of the few people that Sheila ever had anything good to say about. Couldn't you sleep? Yes, if I took a Seconal, which I'd rather not do just yet. [music continues] Lord, I hope that Clinton really does intend to do this movie. Tom has done nothing but rewrite jobs for so long now. And need I tell you the two years we've tried living off Clinton's options on "Freak Show." Hardly paid for the pool maintenance? If a, um, glass of second-rate brandy at this hour might excuse a certain tactlessness why don't you simply dip into capital and produce your own picture? Private finance is not that uncommon nowadays. Lee: Can you imagine how Tom would feel about that? Well, heigh-ho, gang. Going over your hand signals for the bridge tournament? [chuckles] How'd I feel about what? If, um, if after a sudden blackout, we all discovered we were dead as a result of some terrible crash and we're on our way to the great beyond. - Hm, with Clinton as God. - Yes. Give me a sip of that. - It's bourbon. - Right. Well, I hear that calisthenics are at 8:00 sharp. We wouldn't want to incur disfavor at this point. Would we? Goodnight. He's a nice man. - Come on back down. - Mm. - I only had one. - Don't worry about it. Let's just get some sleep. I'd kill myself for a hot bath. Clinton has the only tub. - Want one of these? - I may not need it, doctor. - What's the matter? - I don't know. There's something going on. I'm getting some strange vibes. I'm gonna have a talk with Clinton. - At this hour? - He never sleeps, like Dracula. He hasn't had a good eight hours since the night Sheila was killed. Do you think we'll ever hear the last of Sheila? Tommy, let's just make this movie, and put the money in mutual bonds and go home. [indistinct laughing] Go to sleep, dear boy. They'll give us conflicting reports about it in the morning. [instrumental music] Clinton, I've been thinking on the subject of managing Alice's career. I mean, we do sort of think of her career as our career sort of thing, but still, my... My aspirations do run closer to the production end of things, if you know what I mean. Production, casting, et cetera. Uh-huh! What would you say, and please be absolutely frank, to me asking you for an... an associate producership on this upcoming film? - What would I say? - Mm-hm. I would say, uh, "Boo-hoo." [mock crying] There's nothing worse than a hustler with bad timing. Crissy, put a little of this on my back, will you? I'd really love to, honey, but it'll throw my schedule off. I have to do 25 minutes on my front today. Oh, to make up for the 25 minutes you spent on your back last night. [laughing] Honey, put some gunk on her back, will you? We don't want her to burn. Christine: Anyhow, as I was saying, they shoot you full of these rhino tranqs and then they wrap you in these hot sheets. You wake up five days later about 30 pounds thinner and screaming for hot turkey sandwiches, I mean it... - Hey, you listening to me? - Kind of. I'm here because I've got a client to keep and one to get. What's your excuse? I'm trying to hold on to a husband who's trying to go down. With your money? I like you best alone. You've been telling me that for years. Do you know that guy on the corner who winds up his little mechanical men, and they run crazily around? - I'm that guy. - Oh, Clinton. "Oh, Clinton," what? - I'm sorry. - You're sorry, what? I'm sorry Anthony didn't handle that better. Cut. Print. [Christine humming] Whoo-hoo! Vittorio! Whoo-hoo! Vittorio! Shh! Christine, the crew are having their naps. Jesus! Watch Pakistan, and now naps for sailors? Honey, would you drop me down a Tab? My mouth is so dry I feel like they could shoot "Lawrence of Arabia" in it. You know, Christine just said that her mouth is so dry they could fill "Lawrence of Arabia" in it. Right. Clinton: Tommy! Hey, Tommy! Come on in. Tell us about the rewrite you did on Fistful of Lasagna or whatever the hell it was. You never talk about your work. Why is that? Hey, Philip! Philip! Philip, listen. I've been mulling over the opening sequence. What do you think? We zoom in close on a sleeping bag. Somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, right? It's Sheila's mother in labor. - Think it'll play? - Sorry, Clinton. I didn't quite get that. Shall we play what? Jesus, go back to sleep, Lee. [Christine humming] [instrumental music on stereo] [speaking in foreign language on radio] [humming] [intense music] [whirring] [ship rattling] [screaming] [coughing] [indistinct chatter] [coughing] [coughing] Stand up, Christine! Christine: I hope you were taking movies. [Christine laughs] Where's your robe? - [Christine groans] - Get her a drink. [laughs] Oh, look at me. I got a new hairstyle. [laughing] [screams] He hit me! [groans] Get a... Get me a glass of water and a couple of lesbians. [laughing] Did you hear what I said? My, that was limpy. [Christine laughing] What's the matter with you people? - [laughing] - Christine. I'm so tired. I just have to take a nap now. Wake me up when the credits are over. Hey, there. Is she okay? Yeah, she's alright. Vittorio, Goddamn you, where are you? [clamoring] Alright, alright! You listen, come on. You've got some explaining to do. Don't you know enough not to turn those eggbeaters on when we're ditching around out there? This is a goddamn luxury cruise, not an obstacle course! Look, I've been asking around, and none of us was in sight of any of the others for just those few seconds. Alice claims to have been in her cabin. I was in the lounge with Guido. - Lee was on the top deck. - I was in my cabin. According to the rules of the genre, we should now be looking for a motive. Even Clinton could have climbed up the other ladder and started the engines. Well, well, well, not pawing through my... bag of tricks there, are you, dad? - No, Clinton. - Ooh! [groans] - Trying to get my attention? - It's my back. Come up here, don't you slip a disc. No, don't answer that. We don't want this topic to degenerate into the discussion phase. Take a pill. Vittorio, get my friend two blue with the purple stripe. Maybe if I stayed out of tonight's game. Oh, Jesus, I'd really hate that. But que sera, but as long as you're ready for Saturday night, which is your biggie. - Saturday? - Yep. Moor away, laddies. You like it? [chuckles] I love it. Tiny, tiny islands fascinate my ass. I've got this crazy broker in London that sends me these brochures on all the islands for sale all over the world. Little impoverished islands. A few thousand dollars cash and you're practically king to six shepherds and their families. Or whatever. I read every word on every island. And you know what I do? I tear them neatly in half and drop them in the waste basket. Then I say to myself-- I'm still weak, Clinton, but I'm eating solid food. I say to myself, "If there's one thing I hate, it's to have my island speech interrupted." I say to myself... "No, you poor people, you don't deserve a good king like me." That's what I say. [chuckles] [engine revving] Three hours to magic time. Bye-bye! [dramatic music] Heidi-heidi-ho, gamesters! Everybody on the decky-wecky. Oh, there they are. You know, it really touches me, the way you people humor me, day after day. Here they are, gang, your clues for this evening. Read them and weep. Good work, Tom. Alright, the launch will be back to pick you up at 8:20 sharp. Be ready. Philip: Hey, Clinton! Who are we looking for? Tonight, the homosexual. Philip: In a monastery? Where else? [engine revving] [clears throat] "The isle off the Church of Saint Pierre." Shouldn't that... That must be of, "O-F," hm? "This isle, now largely uninhabited by modest fisher folk was once the domain of the [laughs] now devastating monastery of forgotten men." Hey. This must be a put-on, yeah? Clinton's fine Italian hand. "Travelers engulf from many lands to the site of this former 11 th century refuge of perverts, onanists, catamites and other riffraff of the day." We have just 15 minutes. Just enough time for me to get dressed as a catamite, if I knew what it was. Anthony: Right. Honey, honey, I know this isn't the kind of junk you keep in your head, but, um... - But what? - Well... [clears throat] Can you ever remember hearing any gossip about Alice being arrested? For taking something from a shop. Tom: I'm going to grab a quick shower before we take off. Just be a minute. Okay? Okay? [sighs] Do you think there's a homosexual aboard the yacht? God, I don't know. Is there a dividing line today? Don't patronize me. Patronize? Is that the word you really mean? - Tom: What's the matter now? - I'm sorry. [shower running] Is this game only a game? Tom: I'll be right out. I'll be up on deck. [door opens] [intense music] [water dripping] [owl hooting in distance] [water dripping] [whirring] [indistinct rumbling] [water dripping] [bird screeching] Ah, it's all rather like a Hammer film, isn't it? [thunder rumbling] He's got the sound department working overtime. Lee: It's weird. [owl hooting] And I'm scared. "In these ruins, monks' robes must be worn at all times in respect for the departed brothers." I fear it's to be a costume party. "The evening tour commences at 9:00 p.m. and ends at 9:30 p.m., regardless. To begin before will enrage the spirit of Fra Pervertus. The vows of silence must be observed, so keep..." So keep what? Keep what? Keep... What does it say? [Christine laughs] Christine: I don't like that at all. [ticking] What time is it? [indistinct chanting] It begins. That's Clinton. All we have to do is find him. Vows of silence. Vows of silence. [singing in foreign language] [laughing] Well, it's the sound of music, for God's sake. But then, how are we supposed to know which place to look for him? We're wasting time. [whispers] Clinton. Clinton, what am I supposed to do? [Clinton coughs] Listen, I know it's you. I heard you cough. Now, the others there, they're on tape. Right? [groans] [chanting continues] [water dripping] [owl hooting] [chanting continues] [clatters] [chanting continues] [Philip laughs] That's disgusting. - But clever. - Shh. You'll ruin it. Philip: You're supposed to be Alice, obviously. And you're supposed to be on the other side, so I can use the slider. Much more effective but the door's stuck. Clinton: Goddamnit! How'd you find me so fast? That "lsle off the Church" pun in the brochure. Not up to par, Your Eminence. I'll fix the door. [rattling] They must have loused it up when they moved it. Can I help? [grunts] No, just piss off... my son- [rattling] [chanting continues] [owl hooting] [lightning crashing] [door clattering] Ah, Goddamn you! Oh, for shame. [bird screeches] Damn. Wanna kiss me? [chuckles] You could do with a little more rouge. Mm. Is the volume too high out there? Mm. Too low, if anything. [groans] Shit, nothing's going right. Maybe if I, uh, open the door to the chapel a little wider, huh? [chanting continues] ♪ I got rhythm ♪ ♪ I got... ♪♪ [whistling] Clinton? Clinton. [door creaks] Ollie, Ollie, oxen free! [lightning crashes] Just give us the news, please. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Am I the first? [knock on door] What do I do now? Oh, but, Clinton, don't leave me. Clinton, I hate being scared. Scared. - Ah! - Shh! [whispering] Then Alice has the homosexual card. Just keep your voice down and get the hell out of here. Oh, Clinton, this is just the best game I've ever... played. Darling, it's brilliant. It's really brilliant. [lightning crashing] [clattering] [chanting continues] Alice: Hello? Clinton? Is somebody there? What's going on? Hey, that's not fair. Clinton, you can't do that! [instrumental music] Vittorio thought that Guido had picked him up and vice versa. But he's not in port, and he hasn't slept in his bed. Ah-hah. It's part of the game. It's a clue. He hasn't filled in the scoreboard. Maybe he's still romping around Dragonwyck. Or perhaps lying in a box of Earth with a stake through his heart. - Oh. - Uh... He seemed edgy last night. The door was stuck. Uh, the cassette wasn't loud enough and the-- - What door? - The confessional-- Hey! Loose lips sink ships. Hey! Who cares about the game at this point? I mean, something is flooey. Now, where is he? Christine: Clinton? Clinton? Oh, that's funny. Clinton? [Alice screams] Anthony: Out! Just out! Apparently, there is a God. Do-- don't touch anything. I won't. It must have been the storm. Loosened the stone. Anthony: Well, what do we do with the ladies? Philip: Tell them to wait. Oh, uh, shouldn't we notify the authorities? On an island with two cafes and a weaver? Something's wrong. I hope you brought your fingerprint kit. Oh. I see Clinton finally got this door open, breaking it in the process, as usual. [door creaks] - Alice is sick. - Oh, dear. Anthony: We're going back. [door closes] Ah-ha! Tom: What? A vital clue? Clinton didn't smoke cigarettes. There's no seaplane. [speaking in foreign language] The police will arrive late tonight or early in the morning by craft. It takes six to eight hours. We will harbor here until. Uh, good, good, good. Thank you very much, captain. Well, I guess that means, uh, an inquest and reporters. Yeah, you better get your left profile ready. Oh, shut up, Christine. They can't very well bury him at sea, can they? No, there's too much pollution in the Mediterranean already. Poor Clinton. It's such a shame. It would have been such a big grosser for him. "The Last of Sheila." Hey, now, he's dead. I mean, you sit around here and you talk about some goddamn movie and he's dead... Will you stop hawking that ice bucket? I'm just gonna have my Bloody Mary straight up. Uh, me, too. Bourbon. Christine, listen, Clinton's misadventure is unfortunate, but an accident is an accident, and a film is a film. Has it occurred to anybody that this isn't the first accident? Yesterday, the propeller, last night, the stone. What do you mean? Suppose the propeller wasn't an accident. Suppose it was a mistake. You mean someone was trying to kill Clinton? Why should anyone want to kill Chris? Yeah, we're not in Hollywood. Oh, come off it, Tom. Tom: Look, I assumed Clinton was swimming near the propeller. I heard him yelling. Didn't you? Didn't we all? What fantasies are you building? Who did not solve the game last night? Why did you say, "That's funny" when we were standing outside the chapel? Alice: Because it was locked when I left last night. Then I want to know why was it unlocked this morning, and why did Clinton put the sign out? Anthony: Because the game was over- Alice: It was, but it shouldn't have been. I had the homosexual card, and the game should have gone on until I found him. Tom: Exactly. There were some interesting points in the chapel. Interesting how? I mean, obviously, he was leaving. The storm shook the place and the stone fell on him. Not unless he was crawling. Why would he be crawling? Uh, the, the stone that fell on Clinton's head came from the base of the column. It was grooved. The tops of the columns are shaped like acanthus leaves, the bottoms are grooved- Interesting point number one. Then, uh, there was that piece of wood. What's that? I found it in the folds of Clinton's robe. It's from the grille on the door to the priest's box. Interesting point number two. Um, um, I didn't see any grille on the priest's door. Tom: Oh, right. You never found him, you said. Now, what do you mean, he said? There was a grille last night, but not this morning. That grille was removed. Why? Where's the rest of it? And what was this doing in the priest's box? Clinton didn't smoke cigarettes. Newport. [chuckles] I'm not the only one who smokes Newports. Come on. There are cartons all over the ship. I'm smoking one. Christine: Hey, what's the difference? - Tom: Did you smoke in there? - No. - Tom: You? - I never found him. Of course. I forgot. Honey? I don't know. I don't remember. But surely not in the priest's box. No, of course not. Interesting point number three. A cigarette nobody smoked. See, [clears throat] I don't think Clinton died near the pillar at all. I think he died in the priest's box. And not from a stone falling or otherwise. So what do you think happened? I think he was about to leave when somebody came in. I'm not saying one of us. Somebody came in, smashed through the grille-- Anthony: With what, pray tell? Tom: Mm, I don't know- Maybe something he brought with him. Christine: He or she. Philip: The candle holder, perhaps. Mm, crossed my mind. - Maybe it was an accident. - Oh, maybe, maybe. But at any rate, he decided to make it look like an accident. See, I'm theorizing that he or she stood there for a moment assessing the situation, which would account for the cigarette. Slipped the sign under the door to be sure there wouldn't be any more interruptions. Dragged Clinton over, placing him near the pillar, smashed the stone down, thereby making his first mistake. He assumed the stone was from the top of the column- It wasn't. But then there was very little light. Now, he had the problem of the wood. - What problem? - Darling, darling. He couldn't very well leave the grille broken. He hoped, with the frame empty, it would go unnoticed- Unfortunately, second mistake, One piece had lodged in Clinton's robe. The only thing left to do then was get rid of the splintered pieces, probably into the sea. And the game was over. Hell, I think we can agree that none of us did it, can't we? Well, I mean, who would? I really mean, who wouldn't? But I mean, who really would? Alice: Right. After all, we're not the only people around. What about some of the weirdoes on this ship? What about Vittorio? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what Tom has been saying. Tom has been saying that one of us did it. Or, uh, haven't you been listening? - Now, hold it. - I don't care. That's your problem. [indistinct chatter] Hold it, please. I'm sorry, I was only exploring. I haven't accused anyone. Yet. Look, let me just get this out. Five minutes, and then I'm gonna have five scotches and take a long nap. - You think you know who? - No. No. Then stop telling us what you don't know and tell us what you do. Well, [clears throat] there is someone who might clear this up for us. - Who? - Clinton. So help me God, if this is a hoax and he comes, walks in through that door, I'm gonna throw this cut glass ashtray right in his face. There's no hoax. Clinton's dead alright. Anthony: Just say what's on your mind. - Okay. - May I have another? Tom: I think it's tied up to the game we've been playing this week. Do you all have the cards Clinton handed out on the first night? Oh, we passed it. I may have no idea where mine is. Alright. Alright, I'll go and look for it. Thanks. I wonder what we're gonna feel like an hour from now. When Tom's finished writing the scene, I'll tell you what attitude to play. I've done it before, you know? I'm beginning to wish I hadn't started all this. You could stop right now. It's gonna be interesting. Um, okay? Oh, thank you. Alright. [clears throat] Now, if everyone will, uh, please put their cards, if you'll pardon the expression, on the table. Philip: Well, there's only five there. Where's the other one? Tom? Hm? I'll show mine in a minute. Oh, well, I'd like to see it now. Well, let's give him a chance, shall we? Alright. Alright. Now, we all knew about two of these secrets. We've already played them. "Shoplifter" and "Homosexual." The others we're seeing for the first time. "Ex-convict." "informer." "Child M..." Oh. Excuse me. "Little Child Molester." And mine. So, this was Clinton's idea for a week of fun. Him assigning us secrets, us discovering them. And it was a good game. But some of us began to suspect there was more to it than met the eye. That Clinton had not assigned these six secrets at random, but that each player had been, at one time in his life, guilty of one of them. Oh, no. Not guilty of the secret he was assigned. Clinton was a far more elegant game player than that. And he certainly didn't want us refusing to play on the first night, which we well might have done had we been assigned our own secrets. So it was more than a game. It was a private joke. Anthony: What does your card say? In a minute. A man is dead. Evidence indicates that it's murder. And we've discovered the murdered man was playing a sadistic game with his guests. A game whose central theme was six hidden shreds from the past. Any questions? Yeah, but you see that he, he knew that I never meant to-- - Christine, wait. Wait. - That's bullshit! I mean, nobody would have knocked Clinton's brains in because of some stupid secret. I agree. Look at these cards. Enough to make us squirm. Sure. Enough to remind us of just how nasty Clinton could be. Sure. But enough to kill him? No. Do let's see your card, old boy. "Hit-And-Run Killer." - What is this, a joke? - No. Clinton always took his games seriously. He wouldn't have spoiled this with a joke. It seems clear enough he believed one of us guilty of a hit-and-run killing. Sheila. The game was to be Clinton's revenge. On? The person whom he thought but couldn't prove to be guilty of Sheila's death. On the last night, Saturday, my turn, he was gonna pull the plug on that person. How do you know? Tom: He told me yesterday when he gave me the pill for my back. Ah. Okay, everybody. What are you waiting for? Let's all get up and run around in a circle. [sighs] I mean, this is musical chairs, isn't it? Isn't that what this is... musical chairs? In Tom's mind, anyway. Right, it's just one of Tom's damn fantasies. But you're all still here. Okay... I'll start. Uh... I had a thing with Clinton. It wasn't much more than me feeling sorry for him. It, uh, didn't last long. And it's in the past now. More than ever, right now. Anthony: Uh, Tom, a-- am I just being slow? Are you saying, are you claiming that homosexual card, meaning you're in the clear? Because I don't know about the rest of you. And I'm in no position to challenge your little story, charming as it was. But then it's equally true that Clinton could've come up with some dirty half-truths about you, you, you, or any of us. I mean, what gives you the right, the exclusive right to that card? Fair enough. I just looked at the cards and saw only one that applied to me. Of course, if the same is true of you, Anthony, then that's another story. And it may mean that Clinton's game is invalid. Well? [chuckles] W-- What are you saying? Now, are you trying to say I'm a homosexual now? No, listen. Nobody says you're anything. I just looked at the cards and said I was the homosexual. That's all. Alice: But that was in the past. They're all in the past. Anybody want to say anything? I mean, if ever there was an "unofficial investigation," this is it, right? Or should I tell you that Lee and I once heard rumors about a shoplifting incident concerning somebody in this room? Okay. Thanks. "Shoplifter." That's me. It's the only one. I stole a coat. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Don't look so shocked, Anthony. I'll swipe you some ID bracelets and you'll forget all about it. Tom: Alright. Well. Me for the five scotches. - Tom, if I may? - Sure. That leaves the other four of us somewhat dangling, wouldn't you say? Mm-mm. Hello. Well, what can I say? I was a, I was a secretary. And I was just too eager. So I dropped a few names to the House Un-American Activities Committee. Then those people didn't work for a while. Now they work. Sometimes I try and get them work. Sometimes I see them on the street, and sometimes they cross the street. So what? There is one thing that confuses me. Shoot. I'm just pursuing a thought, you understand? But as I see it, the logical person to have killed Clinton is you, because-- - Because... - No, sorry. Please go ahead. No, no, no, no. No. No, go ahead. - Tom: I need some ice. - That's right. Because no one else felt so threatened. You were the only one... Who knew about the hit-and-run killer card. I was the only one meant to know about it. Remember, Clinton would never have given that card to the person he thought to be the killer. Actually, I was horrified when I saw the card. I spoke to Clinton about it. He laughed. Said he just made up a lot of melodramatic secrets. But I'm guessing the killer overheard our conversation and understood Clinton's real motive. [chuckles] Oh, you're cold, Tom. You think it's me, don't you? Your wife was 100 miles away and your sophisticated director friend here seems cool enough, but I'm a little nervous. Besides, you dislike me too much. I have no reason to dislike you. Anthony: I feel it, though. Anthony, I don't think this is the moment. I think it's the moment. My moment. Time for my theory. Now, today, we saw all the cards for the first time. Now, it didn't take us long to find the truth in three of them. Oh, and your mind worked fast. I could almost hear it ticking over as you quickly labeled Lee the ex-convict, arrested in some anti-war rally. Sentence suspended sort of thing. And Philip here? Oh, he can kid his way along with some witty child molester jokes. And that leaves me. Well, I've done time. I've been in prison twice, for assault. And I can prove it. Can anyone else here make that particular claim? Disappointed, Tom? Actually, I was arrested, um, some years ago- - Anthony: Oh, no. No, no. - I was. I was arrested. No. No, no, luv. Not just arrested. You see that card? "Arrested" is quite different. [clears throat] Well... [clears throat] As a matter of fact, I... [sniffles] At this point, I don't think we can go any further. What? What I mean is, we've established what we set out to prove. [Anthony chuckles] What is this? I mean, we can't, uh, we can't, uh... We all agreed to this. We can't draw any ironclad conclusions. It's all theoretical. Oh, well, that's just fine. It's theoretical. But, I mean, it's hardly fair to stop now, is it? Is it, Philip? Mm? I mean, uh, you want to choose from, uh, what's left? Now, we've got, uh... dented fenders, or... how about a little petting in the playground? Stop, everybody, please. By which I just mean, let me get this over with. - Tom: Honey-- - I was drunk. I was too drunk to drive. No, Tom, stay there, please. I, I'm so sorry I didn't tell you. I know you would've helped me do the right thing, but I just couldn't. I drove down the coast to the party. I overshot the driveway. My car skidded. I didn't even see her. I panicked. So I turned around and I drove all the way back to Santa Barbara. The next morning I wrote that silly note about having to visit my school friend. And I took the car and I drove as far away as I could. Las Vegas. I traded cars at the car rental place, and then that afternoon I drove home. And I thought I was safe. Until the game. It was things that you said, Tom. I started to think, and then... I was the one who looked at the card. I know the point of the game. I think it's vicious and I'd like you to stop it. [Clinton whispering] Oh, go away. Why did you wait so long? Clinton: I only found out last week. Harry's Rent-A-Car, Las Vegas. - Clinton: Remember? - It was-- Clinton: I happened to meet Harry. It was an accident. It was only an accident. I swear, Clinton, I'm sorry. Well, I didn't... Clinton: He said he hoped you weren't still worried about the damage to the car. I couldn't get control. I was drinking! Clinton: The police never checked on out-of-state cars. Please don't tell them. Please. Clinton! Shh! You want to let the whole world know? See, that's what gave me the idea for the game. Because the harder you try to keep a secret in, the more it wants to get out. - Clinton: See you Saturday. - No! [thunder rumbling] Clinton! Clinton! Please! Please! [sobbing] S-- Son of a bitch! [whimpers] Alice: Clinton? Is somebody there? What's going on? [grunts] [thuds] Darling. You're so smart. You didn't think it could be me. He kept whispering. He kept taunting me over and over again. Darling, he was so mean. Lee, Lee, you don't have... I just, I-- I-- I would like to go downstairs and make a clean exit... by myself. Okay? Don't worry, everybody, I'm okay. Okay. Sorry, Tom, but that "clean exit" line bothers me. Oh. Oh, no. Lee! Lee! [rattles doorknob] Lee, open up. Goddamn it, Lee, unlock this door or I'll break it down! Lee: Mmm. I like you, but go away. I want a nap. Then-- then we'll talk about all kinds of stuff. I'm okay. I swear to God, I'm okay. Alright, darling, if you say so. I'll come back in a little while. Okay? Philip: Is she alright? Tom: The door is locked, but she talked to me and... she just wants to be alone. I'm... I'm so... It just never occurred to me. You thought it was Anthony. I don't even know what I thought. - I'm sorry. - Oh, don't be, Tom. You got other things on your mind. Well, what do you think? Think there's anything we can do to help? Let me know what you come up with. Christine: Oh, my God, what a sick business this is! Are you alright? Christine: I am not. I am in a deep state of shock. Anthony just told me the deal that Alice's ex-agents made for her on the Douglas picture and I will never get over it. Would you like some cake? - Yes, please. - How's Tom? He says he doesn't want anything to eat. - What about Lee? - Not a sound. He's been down half a dozen times already. Well, she's probably passed out. Yeah, I never knew she was a boozer. - In and out. - Oh, she was AA for a while. Still locked. She doesn't answer. The captain must have a master key. - I got it. - Philip: Oh. Shall I wake her? I don't know. - You want me to go with you? - No, thank you. Lee. Lee darling? [Lee moans] Christine: You know, when I saw her in that chapel, murder was scrawled all over her face. My God, when I write my autobiography, that line is gonna need a little help. Well, I felt undercurrents all evening. Oh, now you felt undercurrents. Well, you know, I knew it. I mean, something told me it was gonna be a bummer in there. You know, that door creaked open even before I touched it. You know and then Clinton getting so physical, and that awful, faraway look in his eye. Tom. [buzzing] Lee? Lee? Lee? [knock on door] Christine: Who is it? - Philip: I'm sorry. - Oh. Oh, that's okay. Have you met my fiancé? Have you seen Lee? Christine: No, uh-huh. Why, is anything wrong? Tom. - Mm. - Tom. What? Lee is not in her cabin. Where is she? She's not in your room, she's not with Christine, and Alice and Anthony are asleep. Now what do we do? I don't know. [whispers] I don't know. Where's the captain? [dramatic music] [water dripping] [camcorder whirring] How old do you think she was? Don't think about it. Thirty-five? Thirty-seven? I hope you're around if I die. - Alice: Wait a minute. - I don't like getting morbid. [ship horn blaring] I sure hope someone's around. Is it terrible, just terrible to wonder if you can get a good hairdresser in this town? Oh, Christine, you don't really need all that for one night ashore. Listen, I've always dreamed of being interrogated in some cellar by some slob with steel teeth and I wanna look terrific tomorrow. Anthony: Hey, listen. Must be a taxi strike. I mean, if we don't get to the Majestic, they'll give our rooms away. I'll be right back, okay? Besides which, Guido said he'd take me dancing tonight if I'd pay the check. Isn't he cute? I... can't tell you how sorry I am. I know. Are you free later? Listen, darling, uh... thanks for not letting on about, you know, us yesterday. Oh, well, I thought-- There was enough flak in the air, right? Well, there was. Look... why don't we cool it for a while, aside from the bad press angle? Let's be honest with each other. Somehow, your being available and my not being, it's not the same. You'll always be the world's most attractive man. God, what a thought I just got. Namely? If you get married again, give me a call. Isn't that awful? See you tomorrow. Goodbyes after an ocean voyage are always so sad. Whose fault is all this? Clinton's? Lee's? [chuckles] Mine? Or Sheila, for being a tough broad who liked to wander around Bel Air at 2:00 in the morning? Does that make any sense? Nothing makes any sense. Something Clinton said keeps rattling around in the back of my head, if I could remember it. You'll be at the Majestic? My invitation was for a week on the yacht. I didn't bring any pocket money. I'll see you tomorrow, I guess. [indistinct chatter] [speaking in foreign language] [crowd cheering] [church bell tolling] [dramatic music] [music continues] - Anthony? - It's Tom. What's going on here? Jesus, are you waiting for the other members of your coven or what? I've been calling your hotel. Something's not at all right. What are you doing? I'm experimenting. Look at this cigarette. It's the original stub. It's what I went down to ask Lee about last night. Later, I dismissed it from my mind as a whim. But tonight... It's the shape. Mm. That bothered me, too. Philip: Stamp it out. Aha. Now... Try this one. Philip: Quickly, just once. Uh-huh. No, let it burn out. You see, if it's dark and it's awkward for you... you may stamp on the filter instead of the lit end. Tom: If you only have one shot at it. As Clinton did. Clinton? It was in the box where he was killed, after all. - Bear with me, please. - What-- Now, remember, we both thought this came from the priest's box. It doesn't. That wood was carved. This is plain. It's from the side grille. How did it find its way into Clinton's robe? Someone broke the grille. Ah! You're saying, who? Could we be shy one actor in the piece? Meaning someone who saw the whole thing. Now, none of it would seem quite so sinister... if it weren't for this. We found Lee in Clinton's stateroom. But her cabin was locked from the outside. What could she have locked it with? The only key to the cabins was in the wheelhouse. Mmm, well, she probably went into the john and out through my cabin. No, because your door to the bathroom was bolted from the inside. I had to unbolt it myself. There's got to be some explanation. The point is that anybody could have taken the key last night. Then again... maybe Clinton broke the grille, nobody else was there... and I'm just puttering my way through the debris of my rusty imagination. [thumping] Tom. Tom: Mmm. He kept whispering. Philip: Where's the ice pick? And then that awful, faraway look in his eye. Tom: What? I said, where's the bloody ice pick? I don't know. It was... It's been missing since yesterday afternoon. Tom. The back of Clinton's cowl was stained with blood. Of course. You can't strike a man in the face and the back of the neck with the same blow. Meaning that Lee only thought that she killed Clinton. Did the police examine the body? No, what was the point of it? W-- w-- why bother? She confessed. Thomas, we've lost our touch. A good director and a good detective ought to pay more attention to detail. Now, allow me, please. This is the director's cut. The important moment happened before Lee came into the chapel. Whoever it was lit a cigarette and-- and dropped it through the grille. Clinton: Hey. And then, as-- as Clinton leaned forward to stamp it out stabbed him in the back of his neck with the ice pick. Then, I assume, he started to leave the field, but... Christine: Just give us the news, please. ...the timing was unlucky because Christine entered. Now, Christine was sitting there last night chattering about the game. That door creaking open even before I got to it and then Clinton getting so physical. Tom, the door was... open when I came into the chapel. Me, too. He wanted it to stay open so everybody could hear the tape. Exactly. So who closed it? Why did it creak open when Christine came towards it? Because he was trying to get out. Yes. He was compelled to... improvise. He impersonated Clinton. But the grille that he had smashed meant that he couldn't let her into the left side- So he forced open the door at the opposite end. Now... he might have hoped to make a run for it but the, but the sprung door meant that Christine would have a clear view of anyone trying to sneak out of the chapel. I happened to notice that when we discovered the body. Small wonder that Clinton had that, "An awful, faraway look in his eye." [Christine screams] Shh. Then Alice has the homosexual card. Just keep your voice down and get the hell out. Now... the moment Christine left, he intended to duck out as soon as he possibly could but the timing was still unlucky because somebody else came in, Lee- Now, she wasn't going to go until she'd had her showdown with Clinton. So he... he drove her into a state of hysteria, convinced that she'd panic and run. Now, this is taking an awful chance because she could have raised her voice enough to draw attention. But luck was on the murderer's side because Lee presented him with the best possible solution. She exploded. [crashing] She killed a dead man. And needlessly committed suicide. Somebody killed my wife. Not Christine. Um... Alice? Anthony. Oh, my God. Tom, what are you gonna do? Hold on, I'll be right back. [instrumental music] I like any game where you don't have to move. Well, you don't have to for this one. If you're smart enough. [intense music] No, no, no, no, no. Don't throw it away. Keep them till Saturday. Just as long as you're fit for Saturday night, which is your biggie. - Saturday? - Yeah. Mm, she was AA for a while. If you're smart enough. [intense music] She was AA for a while. [splashing] [buzzing] Philip: What did you find? Tom: The beginnings of an idea. Uh-hmm. You seem pleased with yourself. I've had the beginnings of an idea, too, for a scenario. It's about a middle-class writer who is married to a beautiful and wealthy young woman. [chuckles] Is this an original or an adaptation? After a few years, she begins to bore him. Not her money, she herself. And then, while rewriting a picture in Rome, he renews his acquaintance with a cheap but... not untalented young actress. Aren't we getting a little off the subject? I told you something had been nagging me. Something Clinton had said or done. He said we didn't have to move to play the game if we were smart enough. And just now... I noticed this. I thought he was being unusually finicky when he was lining us up. See anything odd? What's odd? Everybody's being posed under a letter. So? Now have a look at these secret cards. There's something peculiar about one of them. Come, come, Tom, where's that puzzle mind? "Little Child Molester." "Little Child Molester?" As opposed to what, Big Child Molester? I still don't get it. The word "little." What's it doing there? Alright. The first night, the "Shoplifter." The second night, the "Homosexual." Now, we don't know which the third was to be, but Clinton told you that the "Hit-and-run killer" was to be last. So let's try the "Ex-convict" next. And then, just for fun, "informer." "Sheila." Clinton needed "little" to give him the "L." God knows he could have found six other secrets for us but he wanted to make a game for himself, too. How to find six secrets that formed an appropriate acronym. The "L" was his only problem. Clever son of a bitch. Cleverer than that. This photograph... showing the six of us... carefully posed under each of the initial letters of our assigned secrets. Something in plain view the whole week. Something he could lord over us... Sunday morning. "Shoplifter, Homosexual, Ex-convict... Informer, Little Child Molester. Hit-and-run Killer?" The last of "Sheila" should be an "A." "Hit-and-run" doesn't begin with an "A," does it, Tom? It's a mistake. Not Clinton's. I remember something else about the first day. You started to crumple your card. This one is smooth. That was dumb, Tom. What was your original card? Alright, let me make an educated guess. Something about Lee. Arsonist? No, that doesn't sound like Lee. Adulterer? No, that's you. A, A, Alcoholic? That's the secret. Like the others, not too heavy, not too light. After all, Clinton was only a minor-league sadist. His aim was to make us uncomfortable, not violent. As he kept saying, it was only a game. You made it more than that. You killed him. Why should I wanna kill Lee? Philip: Alice. Lee's estate must be worth about... three million? Five. Philip: You'd always known she'd killed Sheila, hadn't you? Sure. I knew it the day I got my statement from Harry's Rent-A-Car. Dented fenders, Vegas. I didn't have to be a genius to put two and two together. Philips: Fade in. Exterior. Day. The yacht, the game. You get the "Alcoholic" card and realize what Clinton is up to. Not until Alice so generously told me her leopard coat story. Philip: That late? At any rate... selecting the ice pick. A classic woman's weapon. When did you take it, I wonder? Philip: Private finance is not that uncommon now. Lee: Hmm. Can you imagine how Tom would feel about that? You skipped down to expunge Clinton. Typed up a new card that would incriminate Lee and toddle off to sleep soundly to await the alarms of the morning. Ah... I should've recognized the hatred on your face outside Clinton's door. Was that to have been the moment of truth? Alas, Clinton and Christine were having their own moment of truth. Dissolve. The next day, you did substitute the cards and arranged for Lee to see the wrong one making her think Clinton had sadistic plans to expose her. The stage was set. Subsequent investigation of the cards would now point to Lee as the only person with a motive strong enough for murder. Would you care to explain how I started the propellers with Guido in the room? No. That was my contribution. You wanted Clinton dead, too. You see, I'd helped Alice out of her little unpleasantness, Io those many years ago. So when we began playing the game, looking for a shoplifter... I knew some ugly truths would be trotted out. Not in the least mine. I wanted it stopped. As you pointed out so astutely yesterday, I blundered but it gave you courage to carry on. What do you think? Am I gonna get away with it? You pretended your back was hurting to coax Clinton into revealing... what day your secret would be played. Just as long as you're ready for Saturday night, which is your biggie. It was only Tuesday. Four days' grace. Clinton's choice of a location was a gift. But you had to... [buzzing] ...make sure that you found him before Lee confronted him with the false card. So you followed me because I'd been boastful enough to hint that I'd figured out the clue. After my session, you came in and proceeded to play Clinton's game as well as your own. Maybe if I open the door to the chapel a little wider? Hey, what the hell? [Clinton screaming] [Clinton groaning] Then you put on your little ventriloquist act for... Christine and Lee. I should've realized. We'd all seen you impersonate Clinton. [mimicking Clinton] Gang, going over your hand signals for the bridge tournament? Ha-ha-ha. [chuckling] How'd I feel about what? You know too much to live. How convenient for you that Lee... exploded. But how inconvenient for you that she thought quickly and... arranged everything to look like an accident. You must have been furious. So you... rearranged everything to look like a murder that looked like an accident. She had picked up the right stone. You replaced it with the wrong one. I'll bet that other stone, stained with blood, is still in the corner. As well as the cigarette that... Lee actually smoked. But, no matter, you knew that the next day when you conducted your brilliant investigation, Lee would naturally assume that she had made the mistake. And it was brilliant. What better detective than the man who's committed the crime? Every hesitant conclusion, every stumbling interpretation. And when you suddenly panicked, protecting your wife it was dazzling, dear boy. It's after 12:00 already. Is it? Well, good. That gives us plenty of time. Because the entire crew is happily celebrating the death of their master in the port. Aren't we lucky? Tom: I think so. [Philip sighs] If you're thinking of setting up for another fake suicide sequence, I must warn you of the dangers of improvisation. This last exploit had far too many loose ends even though you had four days to prepare it. You'd even planned for the obligatory confession scene the morning after the murder. You knew that she would need some fortification when you started turning the screws. You felt you were safe because no one else on-board drank bourbon. Which, incidentally, you don't pour out of a porthole and then toss the bottle overboard. You pour it down a drain. Unless there's something else you're anxious to get rid of like seconal. [eerie music] I don't have any gloves. Oh. [grunting] [shattering] [crashing] [grunting continues] [grunting] [Philip grunting] [Lee groaning] [crashing] Christine: Hey, you guys, knock it off! Knock, you-- [panting] Jesus Christ, look at this place! Philip: Oh! Actually, we've been having a little difference of opinion. Yeah, well, we've all gotten little squirrelly on this trip, but don't you think you're carrying it a little too far? About the "Last of Sheila" project. But it's all straightened out now. What are you doing on board? I'm trying to sleep. Well, not exactly. Well, Guido took over for Vittorio and asked me to keep him company. So we went into Clinton's room to listen to the stereo and instead of getting mood music, we get you two guys yakking on the intercom. [speaks in foreign language] I mean... dictate it tomorrow when you can get a secretary, you know. He killed her, she killed him. Oh, that's a good idea but, uh, we're agreed on the basics, wouldn't you say, Tom? Uh, now that the truths are known, we've begun to see this as a big, big project. There are gigantic themes here, worthy of Dostoyevsky. There's innocence... guilt... hatred... loyalty. Lee's ambitions for Tom were such that we, as survivors, feel bound to tell Sheila's story in all its pitiless purity, sparing nothing. Big budget, huh? I feel five million should cover it. Well, Alice's price just went up. Tom, nobody can write it better than you. Who handles you again? Philip: Oh, well, actually.. I'm keen on having the first draft done by a complete outsider. Someone who will bring a naivety to our little inbred circle. Of course, Tom will be needed as technical advisor. And just before shooting, for a few... Rewrites. Rewrites, exactly. Well, I think I'll turn in. I'm almost dead on my feet. So much to do tomorrow. And still a few pages to type tonight. Sealed letter to my solicitor. Protecting the copyright sort of thing. In these perilous times, one can't be too careful. - Coming, Christine? - Mm. Honey, let me hit you with a couple names. Yul Brynner as Clinton. Paul and Joanne as Tom and Lee. I don't know, I hope it's got enough content for them. Who have I got for Alice? Oh, I know, Carly Simon! I mean, the soundtrack album alone will pay for her clothes. Now, now, don't scream. Virna Lisi. No, darling, as me!
