How can you let some idiot take the goods from your territoryl'? We also lost some good men... What are you going to do if the deal is off'? Weill'? This means war! Sir, sorry about being late. I don't care what you did at home. I'm only interested in what we're going to do starting now. Right. The men who took the drugs aren't just some thugs off the streets. Take a look around and smoke him out. Yes sir. We're still closed. Oh, come on. How about some coffee? No. Hey you have some right here! What do you think you're doing!?

Try it if you dare, bastard! What the!? Bro! When did you get out of prison? Welcome! Welcome! Please, this way! Outta our way! Please, come in! Here's one for you... Here, for the rest of you. What has happened to Brother'? He was a cheapskate before going to jailed. Who knows? Look, all I know is that as long we're with him, vve got it made. Sake! More Sake! You look pretty blue. I can try cheering you up. What's your name? Come on, say something. It's that mustached guy right there. You know what to do. It looks like... you've been using. Those drugs vvill destroy you someday you know. Don't worry I won't let them touch you ever again. Damn it! Hovv dare he use me like this! Mom, can you make me some coffee? You got yourself a girl, haven't you'? What a good son you are... ...hiding from your mom and playing around with girls like that. Why didn't you come out and tell me'? Because it's obvious that you're going to hate her! That's because you never bring anyone good! Haven't you learned yet? None of those broads vvill do you any good when the going gets tough. Like that girl Satoko used to be crazy about you. She didn't last 6 months without you around when you went to jail. I bet she's fucking some other guy now. Shut up about Satoko! She only left because you got so jealous of her. Oh, so you were actually in love with that woman, who's like a prostitute? I told you not to talk about her! You used to be one yourself! You're your father's son all right. You're acting just like he used to when he was still alive. He used to be out all the time, spending his money drinking and fooling around... ...and when he does come back, he'd beat me and you. That's what a typical Yakuza is like. I don't want you to grow up to be garbage just like him. That... that's the only reason I prostituted myself to raise you! Awake or asleep, you were always on my mind... Mom... I'm sorry I was just foolin'. Cheer up. Women... they're not for me. You're the only one I need by my side, mom. He¥ Were you just sucking on your mother's teat'? What do you want'? I think I want some too. Stop it. We're not here to fight today I need half of the drugs that you stole from the Mutsumi Group. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't play dumb with me. I have all the proof I need here. Oh, come on, how is that any proof'? There's not many people with machine guns in Japan. I already know that you bought one from the Americans as soon as you were out of the jail. If you want I can bring you the guy that sold it to you. Well? I know you risked your life for those drugs. I won't ask for all of it. Only half. It's probably better than being ratted to the Mutsumi Group and getting wiped out. Come to our office at 2 a.m. V\Ath the goods, alone. Sorry about all this, mom. See ya. We'll be waiting. You here, put your hands up! What's the meaning of this? We're checking for the illegal possession of firearms. Hey do you have a warrant for that? Come on. Don't move. Calm down. &lt;i&gt;Mm faster.&lt;/i&gt; It's in the basement. Man... this is bad. Call an ambulance. He)" You idiot! Tell me... who did thisl'? If you tell me I'll avenge you! "I have sent over two of our members over to you: Sam Nelson and Charlie Robson. Giuseppe Martelli, New York' Hey when are you going to give me your final decision? I don't see how a guy like you can be alive doing the things you're doing. Mr. Sam, what's his name? Charlie. Charlie... Take off your hat. It's a Japanese custom. Take it easy Enjoy yourself while in Japan. There should be nothing that would annoy you. I'll hara-kiri if something bad happened to you. &lt;i&gt;Hera-km'?&lt;/i&gt; That's okay I wanna see the real way the Japanese do it. You like sea shells? Okay? Why you! Get up! Damn it! Damn... So did they tell where they're hiding the drugs'? Well, they keep telling us that they have no clue what we're talking. What are you doing'? Let me go! I don't know! I don't know anything. Take a good look! Tell us, now! Where are the drugs! Like I said before, I don't know! You damn punks! Do you vvant to die'? Where did you put it!'? V\/here'? You and I are the same color. I'm gonna save your life. But... Stop up with your gibberish! I can't tell you what I don't know! Damn yankee! Takeshi! Why you! Come at me! Let me handle him. Run! Noboru, jump! - Where are the drugs! - I don't know. - Tell! - I don't know anything about any drugs! Damn... I guess we'll have to capture their boss and beat it out of him. Where's Yabuki? I don't know! Where is he'? - I don't know. - Tell me! I don't know. I don't know. Go go go! Keep that lead! YES go! Go! God damn it, go faster! Damn it! Stupid horse. Honey... VWI you help me'? Don't worry... just close your eyes. Call the police. Murder, murder! Please, somebody! Please! Save me! - Stop! - Murderer! I'll fucking kill you! Stop! Stop it! You bitch, I'll kill you! Stop! - Stop! - Hold on. Don't make a fool out of me. “Bit! Oh my are you the detective'? I'm Ryuta Yabuki's mother. I'm very sorry about my son causing you trouble. - Madam... - Yes. There are no listening devices, nor any video cameras. It's just as two of us... ...so stop acting. Let's talk frankly I'll promise your son's life. But, in return I vvant you to return the drugs you stole to the syndicate. What are you talking about? You just have to tell him to do it, he loves you. That is, if you care for him at all... ...I'm sure he'll be convinced if you speak to him. Only 5 minutes, got it'? Mom! Mom, how did the syndicate find out'? I don't know... The detective who captured you... He's working for the syndicate. What'? He wants me to convince you to return the drugs in exchange for your life. What did you say'? That I had no idea what you're talking about, but I'll talk to him anyway You don't have to worry about mommy We're good as long as we have the goods. If we're tricked and tell about them, it'll be the end for us both. I know... Mom... I know it'll be hard, but I want you to look after our fortune. You're so... It's time. Come with me. What did he say'? He said he had no idea what you were saying. Perhaps this is all some sort of a mistake? Stop messing around with me! Look at the proof! ANOTHER MACHINE GUN SHOOTING! One of them told us everything before he died. Damn, so you're the one who alerted the syndicate. So what? If you're also part of it, then maybe you know where it's being held. - Like hell I do. - Shut up! Fine, then we'll arrest you on another charge. I'll interrogate you day and night without giving you anyfood until you tell us! Even if you die here, vve can just say you had a heart attack. Well? FEW MONTHS LATER What'? Stop scaring us like that. Why you... You guys haven't seen anything, got it'? We're from the Mutsumi Group. You know why we're here. Tell us where you hid the drugs! Tell us! Tell us! Tell us, you fuckvvad! Hey the supervisor is coming. You all right'? Shut up. Man... all that after I just saved you'? I didn't ask for your help. You all right'? I'm going to die! Keep quiet! Hey get back to your stations! He couldn't have drowned in the bath! This is obviously a murder case! I'll parole anyone who tells me who did it, so step forwvarcl. Got if I? Weill'? You and lshihara didn't get along... It was you, wasn't it!'? How should I know'? Tell me! Ishihara was near you, wasn't he'? You must've seen Yabuki kill lshihara. I didn't see a thing. Stop playing dumb! Come on out, you got a visitor. Mom! Oh, it's you. Is mom well? How's mom doing'? What's with the long face? Did something happen? It happened while she was under interrogation by the police... Calm clown! Stop it! Hey! Stop! Yabuki! Why you! Throw him inside! Honey! It won't do anything. Mom! What happened to your mother'? She's dead'? Well? She'd lived a long time. You're pretty lucky I even don't know the face of my mother. She died when I was born. So he didn't tell you where the drugs were hidden. Nope. If I try to ask, he'll get suspicious of me. So you're going to arrest him after he escapes prison and goes to the place the goods are hidden? Are you sure you'll be okay by yourself? Well, I'm sure my past record of using the same trick speaks for itself. Just make sure to be careful. This isn'tjust some heroin bust. We're trying to destroy a major syndicate behind it. Sir, could you set up conditions for them to try a jailbreak? Very well. First, I'll put the both of you together for a transfer to another prison. Making a move then will probably look more natural. Good afternoon, sir. Was anyone hurt'? No sir. Everything went as planned. Who is it'? It's me. It's me, damn it! Open up! Honey... Turn it off. It's cold. Hurry up. That's a friend of mine. Greet him. We busted out together. What are you doing'? The cops are after us! Go get packed. Serve food. - Yes. Get my friend's stuff too. Don't you think the broads gonna slow us clown'? We'll be fine. Being with a girl will help us blend in. This is his but I think it'll fit. So do vve go to get the drugs'? No, there's something I have to do first. Don't stop. Keep going... ldidn't do anything. You got to believe me. I was just questioning her and she had heart failure... Oh really? Then just shut up and keep driving. Listen up... The place where I stashed the billion yen's worth of drugs is... No, wait! I don't want to know! Don't say it! Thank you for coming. - Fill her up. - Right. The fuck did you just say to me!? How can three passports cost me 5 million yenl'? My business is in taking advantage of somebody's condition. In return, lvvon't open my mouth even if the police or the mob comes after me. Trust is what I'm selling here. &lt;i&gt;You can ask someone else if you don't like it.&lt;/i&gt; Fine. Damn it... My mother and I risked our lives to get this together... I was hoping that we'd still be together when we come back to get it. I know how you feel. Negura... You're a good guy You're the first guy who ever touched my treasure besides my mother. Give me the passport. So he's the one you're going to flee with? 5 million, right'? You're such a fool... &lt;i&gt;Nezu, have you gone mac“?&lt;/i&gt; What do you think you're doing to my friend! Hey have you forgotten my face? ...Mr. Special Investigator. I hope you live long. I've been tricked by you. I was made a laughingstock. &lt;i&gt;When a wind blows...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;When a wind blows...&lt;/i&gt; ...on &lt;i&gt;a whim I'll&lt;/i&gt; go... &lt;i&gt;...on a trip without a destination...&lt;/i&gt; ...on &lt;i&gt;a trip without a destination in mind.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;If it's me alone...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;...no one will stop me.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Ifs only my footprints...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;ifs only my footprints...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;...that will fol/ow me.&lt;/i&gt; Thank you for coming. Come in. Oh, come in. It's been a while. Oh, you~re . @3223 Welcome inside! &lt;i&gt;Yum“!&lt;/i&gt; So just one today? Please, take your time. Yano! Thank you. I've been looking for you for a while, Satoko. Wait for me on the 2nd floor. I'll be right there. You look so sexy So you have a man? It's been 10 years. Of course I have one. You didn't come to see me, did you'? Don't be so cold. You're the one who left me while I was in jail. You think I can stand being with your mother for that long'? Don't talk bad about my mother! They're after me. You have connections with some fishermen, don't you? Can't you set us up with a boat that'll take us to Korea? You haven't changed at all, have you'? You're selfish and you aren't thoughtful at all. It's okay though. At least you still remembered a girl like me after 10 years. What about the girl you're with? I left her outside. How cruel! Are you keeping her standing in this snow'? I'll bring her in then. Vhéit. I'll go. You can't afford to be seen, right'? Come on in. He's waiting for you. There's one fisherman who might help. He's a bit rough, but that's probably better for something like this. Come in, please. It's not too clean, but make yourself at home. I'll see you later. All right. I'll be right there! Sir, Yabukfs been spotted in the town of Ozu! Don't kill him, not until we have the goods back. Right! Let's go! Sam. Don't kill him! You still worried'? She's nothing to me. Honey... Go on ahead. Aren't you coming too'? Go to the Ozu Port. I'm sure the taxi driver knows where it is. Bye... Where's Yabuki? You seriously think I'd tell'? We have ways of making you. Let me have another drink first. Is the girl here'? Keep the engine warm, so that we can leave ASAP. Yubuki! Take a good look! If you want the girl back, give us the drugs! God damn it! I'll give you the damn girl! Let's go. Honey! &lt;i&gt;When the sea becomes rough...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;When the sea becomes rough...&lt;/i&gt; ...on &lt;i&gt;a whim I'll&lt;/i&gt; go... &lt;i&gt;...on a trip without a destination...&lt;/i&gt; ...on &lt;i&gt;a trip without a destination in mind.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Once I get on the waves, I can never go back.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;When a seagull cries...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;When a seagull cries...&lt;/i&gt; ...I'll cry too.
