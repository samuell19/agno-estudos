My name is Austin, James T. Austin of the Kennington journal. - We need some protection. - Who from? Two men following us in a car, they're out to kill us. Relax mister, ain't anybody gonna kill you here. Don't be too sure of that. Look sergeant, I've gotta get to the capitol this morning... and alive preferably. - How do I get an escort? - An escort?! It ain't so simple, who'd you say you was again? James, the shotgun in his driveway last night. This is what I'm talking about right here... and the same thing exactly could happen to us. Well it's kinda early but I'll see if I can get the chief. 3, 2, 1. - Hot coffee? You look all done in ma'am. - Thank you. Hello Sadie? Yeah Cady, I get you up? Look, is the chief home? I gotta talk to him. He is, is he? I guess there's no point bothering you with it. Yeah, you have him call me when he comes in, thanks. Chief ain't where he can be reached right now mister. There's some trouble the other side of town, he'll be back directly. - How soon will that be directly? - Inside of an hour his wife... An hour?! You sure married yourself a bright boy. Jim! - Does this machine work? - Sure does. - May I use it? I'll pay for the tape. - I guess so. This is James T. Austin. My wife, Marge and I are in the Warren police station. In case anything happens to me before... I have a chance to tell my story in public... I want this for the record. Time doesn't permit to sort the facts... perhaps I'd better just tell what happened. This isn't a pretty story nor even a new one... what the moral is right now I don't know. It began several weeks ago back in Kennington. Kennington, in case you haven't been there... is a little over 300 miles from here. It has a population of 36,000... looks pretty much like any other American town of the same size... it's an up-to-date business district... scattered around are the usual small industry warehouse sections... modern schools and playgrounds, a lot of comfortable homes. Taken altogether it's a pretty good town, nice place to live. On the day I'm talking about, it started more or less like any other day. - Bye darling. - Wait a minute, my garden column. Be through in a second. If I'd known I'd end up doing articles on compost and earthworm culture... I wouldn't taken Ag instead of English lit. What's the plural for gladiolus? Wouldn't be gladioluses? Two seconds too late darling, I just took the last of it. You wouldn't have liked it anyway, it was all dregs. I was just thinking, what about calling the column "The Green Thumb"? - Not bad. - Not bad? I thought it was pretty wonderful. It is wonderful and you're wonderful. Jim, how do you expect me... Sit down. Over there, way over there. It is gladioluses. You live and learn! See the ad we got from Hopwoods? Full page. I can just see us getting richer and richer and richer! Here you are. This letter came. - Yes, the country club. - What is it? Membership application, they had a couple of vacancies. It was more Don's idea than mine. Are Don and Sally joining too? So he said, he thought it'd be good for business. What's the matter darling? I thought you'd like the idea. Of course I like it, it's just... when a girl let's herself get talked into... becoming the wife of a country editor she forms a mental picture. Taking in chickens and string beans and corn in exchange for subscriptions. - Maybe going without shoes. - Hasn't turned out that way has it? No darling, not exactly. - Happy? - Of course I am. - Jim! - Take care of me. - Call me if you're gonna be late. - Ok. Yes, I'd been mighty lucky, I felt that morning. I begun to feel as if we'd really become a part of something. Kennington wan't just a town, it was our town. And as far as the paper was concerned... well the journal was a New York Times maybe... but in the 5 years we'd taken over... everyone seemed to think we'd done quite a job. Don, who handled the business end, and I had been in the army together. Being friends it made it more than just another partnership. Hey Jim, put your John Henry on this. - Good morning Mr McDermott. - Morning Jim. How's the news spread situation? - Can't complain. - I'll say he can't! What's this bring it down to now? $4,400 but don't worry about it, I don't. - Your ad's all set. - That's swell. Why don't you go on back, we'll be with you in a minute. Seems like all we do is work for the paper company. Why don't we just give them the plan! Here you are. Hiya Bill, what's the problem? A guy by the name of Nelson has been calling. - Nelson, who's he? I asked him that, he said you knew him... wouldn't talk to anybody else, said it was confidential. Yeah, him. What gives with this guy? He sounds like he's short a couple of buttons. - He's a detective. - In Kennington? - Sure, why not? - Brother! - Morning Judy. - Jim, I've simply got to talk to you. Now look, they left out 8 inches in my column again yesterday. Mrs Hathaway's teeth, Mrs Combine's reception for Dr Boon... We were short of space. I notice you always have plenty of space for politics. Women read the paper too you know. Glenda, you're absolutely right! Well then... Without our brilliant society page we'd be just another newspaper. - Do you really mean that? - Of course I do. Say, that's a very attractive hat you're wearing. Do you like it? I bought it for the women's club luncheon today. You'll knock 'em dead! Yes, but... Be off in a minute. - Morning Henry, how's the space? - Pretty tight. The wife's home garden column hey? Don't worry, we'll get it in, I'll set you up a good head. Thanks Henry. Now if you want any changes made we can still get it in today's paper. Well, here we are. That's fine Don, fine. Great idea you boys cooked up. - We have to convince you guys that advertising pays. - Hello. - What I like is the way you've taken hold... - For you Jim. We were talking it about just the other day. Well I tell you, we've tried hard to do a good job. Austin speaking, hello. Hello Nelson. Mr Austin, I've gotta see you, I've got a story for you. No, I can't come over there. I can't tell you why, not over the phone. - You'll have to meet me. - Better luck. Sure. Alright, where? The library?! I'll be there. - Nelson? What did he want? - Says he's got a story. Bet it's a touch. - Mr Austin? - Yes. I'm Mrs Nelson, he's back there. - Hi. - Hi. - Did anybody see you come in? - Nobody in particular. - What is this anyway? - It's just like I say, I've got a story. How would you like to bust this town wide open? Ok, let's have it. - You know Chief Gillette? - Of course I know him. - What do you think of him? - I think he's alright, why? Suppose I was to tell you he's crookeder than a fishhook. I'd say you was talking through your hat. I thought so. Listen to this... A few days ago I take on a case, I guess you know Murray Sirak? - I've seen him around. - Well this is his ex... And she's heard that Sirak held out on the divorce settlement. She wants to take him to court. Well I began digging into the thing, on the QT understand. His insurance business and... other properties he has under dummy names and... I visited a few of the horse parlors. The easiest money to hold out on I figured is what he takes on making book. Yeah and what happened? I don't guess you've ever crossed the powers of this town Mr Austin. - No I haven't. - You ought to try it sometime, it's a great experience. From the first day I started work I began getting these tags. - All for parking? - Not only parking. I make a left turn, I'm in the wrong lane. I make a right turn, the same thing or I'm obstructing traffic. We go to a movie, somebody's been through the house. And I can't work, I can't even turn around without the cops being on my tail. Do you mean that the police have been... trying to stop you investigating Murray Sirak? What do you think?! I ain't never been in any trouble before. This is simple, they don't want me nosing in Sirak's business... because they're getting a cut. - Can you prove that? - Prove it? You mean we've got bookies and the cops don't know it? Why ain't they closed if the cops ain't getting a cut? Let me tell you the rest of it... The day before yesterday I got a phonecall from Chief Gillette's office. They've revoked my private investigator's license. No, they can't do that, not without a cause. You think they can't? Well they just did! And I ain't gonna stand still for it, see. I'm 50 years old Mr Austin, it's too late for me to start over now. Without that license me and the little woman don't eat. Look Nelson, I'm sorry but what can I do? You've got a paper haven't you? Crack this whole rotten mess wide open, that's what you can do. - Sirak and the police... - Now look... If you're in a jam with Chief Gillette I'd like to be able to help. But the journal's a newspaper not a grindstone. You mean you don't believe me? I don't believe that Chief Gillette... runs interference for Murray Sirak or anybody. No, I don't believe you. Why do I get the treatment then? Why am I ducking and hiding? We'd better go Clyde, they're here. There you see, what do you call that if I'm talking through my hat? Clyde please let's go. - Maybe I ain't so crazy after all Clyde! Well that was how it started. You meet all sorts of crackpots in the newspaper business. Only trouble was the police could've had a tail on him. Made me just curious enough to wonder what the real story was. One thing about a town the size of Kennignton... when you wanted any information... you could go straight to the chief of police himself. In a way I'd always liked Chief Gillette. As towns go I felt he ran a pretty good one. To a newspaper man almost too good. For instance, on page 1 crime stories, but all we got was one a month. - There you are Frances. - Thank you sir. Nelson? Now don't tell me he's been over to see you too? Yeah, what's his beef? Frankly we had nothing to do with it Jim... these license matters are all handled by the state. Why was his license revoked chief? What did he do? Well nothing actually, a not too savory past caught up with him, that's all. You know they have to be a little careful. A man who's been hot-headed enough to pull a trigger once... well how can they be sure he won't do it again? Nelson never should've been granted a license in the first place. He wouldn't have been if he'd had a complete record on him. I see. Chief, you probably think I just pulled into town with... a wagon-load of pumpkins, I've got another question to ask. Go right ahead. You've been keeping a tail on Nelson. Yes we have. - Any of my business why? - No. But I'll tell you why. Our new budget's coming up before the city council in a few days... and when I heard Nelson was running around town... shooting off his mouth about the department... I thought I'd better keep an eye on him. I'm asking for a small raise for my men and I'd like to see them get it. Now does that answer your question? As a newspaperman yes but... as a taxpayer I'm a little bit worried about that small raise! Sorry to have bothered you chief. No bother at all. For you and the journal anything, anytime. - We've always been friends haven't we? - Sure have, thanks. So long Jim. Well as far as I was concerned that was that. I promptly forgot all about Nelson. Then one night a couple of weeks later... when we were all out at the country club... Well... middle-age! What he means is just plain middle. Before we were married I could never get him home... he always wanted to dance all night. No more I could tell you. - Telephone Mr Austin. - Thanks. - Must be some blonde I know. - It better not be! Hello. Hello Nelson. I'm sorry to bother you Mr Austin but I've got to see you. I've got to see you now! Call me tomorrow at... Yeah fine, tomorrow. I can't wait until tomorrow. Do you think I'd have called you if there'd been anybody else I could go to? I'm in trouble, bad trouble. Listen, you know Tony's? I'll meet you here. Get this through your head, I'm not gonna meet you anywhere, not tonight. Hello. Well, nothing like curling up at home with a good book... That's what I always say, hey waiter. No. Leaving already Reverend Nash? Yes, I found that beyond a certain point... my presence doesn't add anything to the festivities. Why don't you fellas give me a ring next week and we'll make up a foursomes. You've gotta look out for this old spellbinder boys. He'll take your shirts! - Good night. - Good party Reverend. Well, don't suppose anybody needs a good used car? No. Ok, you've already got one. Say, what happened to your dancing partner Don? She's telephoning, complications, new babysitter, she'll be back. That wife of yours kills me. She's a real kick. There she is now. - Here comes your dreamboat. - No, I can't, not again. Sally, now wait, you just can't freeze him out, he's an advertiser. I don't care what he is, what about my feet?! - Tell him I... - Hiya sugarpuss. How about us giving those folks another dancing lesson? Why of course Mr Anderson, I'd be delighted. - What's the matter with her? - Nothing, she just... Darling, what's wrong? I've gotta get back to town Marge, come on, let's go. But darling I don't understand. You talked to this man once, if he didn't make sense then... I didn't say he didn't make sense, I said he was scared. Jim. Yeah, looks like an accident. - Hey Smithy. - Hi Jim. - What happened? - Hit and run, man killed. - Know who it was? - Yeah, let's see... Man by the name of Clyde Nelson. By the time I'd dropped Marge off at the house... and driven over to the morgue it was midnight. I wasn't any too pleased with myself right then. Somehow I couldn't get rid of the thought that if... I hadn't brushed Nelson off he might still be alive. I also felt that there were a couple of questions that needed to be answered. And what makes you so sure it was hit and run? The guy telephoned me, I tell you he was in trouble. And on top of that... if his car is still at home how come he got on the highway, fly? Well what's spurting Del? We went all over him lieutenant, multiple fractures. Nothing that wouldn't be the result of... his having being hit by a fast moving car. - Satisfied? - No I'm not satisfied. It seems to me you fellas are taking the easy way out. Mrs Nelson, that's all. I'm sorry Mrs Nelson, very sorry. - This way Mrs Nelson. - Don't you touch me! - You'd better take her home. - It's alright, I'll take her. Funny how you know things. When he left tonight I knew he wouldn't come back. It was after supper... he'd been worrying so I thought it'd do us both good to take in a movie. When we came out of the house I didn't notice anything but Clyde... Clyde saw this car. - What car? - Just a car. I don't see too well without my glasses. Clyde said it had a Florida license. The lights were off. There were two men in it. - Could you tell who they were? - No. And they didn't do anything, they were just sitting there. Clyde didn't say much... I guess he was afraid for me more than anything else. He took me back inside and said not to open the door, not for anybody. And then he went out the back way to call you. Why didn't he call from the house? The phoned was tapped. I know it sounds crazy. Things like this just don't happen, not here. There's the house over there. But you don't know this town, not the way I do. What I don't understand is... why this had to happen to us. We've never done anything or hurt anybody. I suppose they told you that... Clyde's license was being revoked because of his record. - Yes they did. - Well it isn't true. It had nothing to do with his record, he had a good record. What they dug up was ten years old. They knew all about it. The whole thing was gone into when he first applied for a license. They just used it as an excuse. - The police? - Of course not. Clyde never had any trouble with the police. Not until he came up against this... Murray Sirak. Mrs Nelson let me get this straight... Are suggesting your husband might've been killed by Murray Sirak? Killed or had killed, what's the difference? He was investigating Sirak wasn't he. And all the graft he hides behind that insurance business. Who else could it be? Don't you worry about it Mr Austin. I know your heart's in the right place. But there's nothing you can do. Sirak's a big man. Clyde was just... nobody. It's wrong but... that's nothing new either. Thank you for everything. On the way home I found myself stopping in front of Sirak's office. Murder isn't a word you toss around lightly, at least not in Kennington. Sirak was a fairly important man... he had a finger in a lot of pies around town. Maybe if I was smart I'd leave this alone, let the police handle it. But that only brought me back to Chief Gillette. Gillette had told me the police hadn't known about Nelson's record. According to Mrs Nelson they definitely had. Just to get it straight... the next morning I got off a letter to the state license bureau. Hey, what happened to you last night? By the way, I heard Nelson was killed, hit and run. Yep, so they tell me. - You mean it wasn't? - His wife doesn't think so. - What did the cops say? - They're not saying, they're just tired. You know, I think maybe I'll light a little fire under their tails. Ok, only... Take it easy? Don had a point, I did take it easy. About all I said was... a man had been killed and somebody ought to do something about it. Nothing happened so I started running a little daily feature on page 1. - What are trying to do Jim, be funny? - No, not particularly. Well what is this box score business? Nelson case, box score, 7th day. Arrests, nothing. Convictions, nothing. Results, nothing. Stuff like this may be great for circulation but why pick on us? You know we're doing all we can. Well that's just the point chief, are you? Maybe you'd like to take over here. There it is, it's all yours. What about that Florida car? Now be a little realistic will you. Do you have any notion of... the number of men it'd take to do the job you're asking for? With no descriptions, nothing, no numbers, just a Florida license plate. If there was such a car it could be in California by now. - What's this? - What? My letter to the license bureau, what's it doing here? Relax, it came to the mayor this morning, he sent it over to me. - You know, the usual routine? - What routine? Well no state bureau ever gives out confidential information... unless they know who you are, you know that. Well can't they read, this letterhead tells who I am. That's not what I'm talking about. Does this mean I can't inquire into a matter of public record... without you're ok first? - Of course it doesn't. - So what is this, a private club or something? If you'll keep your shirt on maybe I can explain it to you. It seems to me it explains itself. Who are you covering up for chief? Listen you young punk, I'm not covering up... and I don't take that kinda talk from anybody. And another crack like that out of you and... you'll find yourself barred from the station. A man was killed chief. You say it was hit and run, I think it was murder. Since you're not doing anything about it do you mind if I take a try? - Not at all. - Much obliged. - Good luck. - Thanks. That's two machines, 60 cents, 40 cents for the drier, 10 for the bleach... That's a dollar ten altogether. May I help you? - I'm looking for Mrs Sirak. - I'm Mrs Sirak. - Jim Austin of the Journal. - Yes. - Was Clyde Nelson working for you? - Why do you ask? Well I wondered if you'd mind telling me what it was he was working on. You'll have to excuse, I'm very busy. Look Mrs Sirak, I've no intention of prying into your personal life. All I want to know is what, if anything, Nelson found out. As far as I know he found out nothing. Besides, I fail to see how it's any of your affair. When a man is killed it's apt to become almost anybody's affair. What am I supposed to make from that remark? You know he was killed of course? Has it occurred to you Nelson might've been killed... as a result of something he learned working for you? Sirak? You're out of your mind! I lived with Murray Sirak for 26 years... and I've seen him do a lot of things but murder... - Murray wouldn't hurt a fly. - You're not being very helpful. Really Mr Austin, I have customers waiting. Anyhow, I know nothing, absolutely nothing... and I would prefer not to discuss it. Water under the bridge. - You know Mrs Sirak, it might be to your advantage to be more cooperative. - How? Well, you were planning on taking your ex-husband into court. Maybe we were after the same information. If you'd help me maybe I could help you. Well that's very thoughtful but hardly fair. Whatever you fancy you could do for me... I'm sure there's nothing I can do for you. Well I sure made a bust of that! My first time at bat and I struck out. - You wanna see somebody? - Yes, is this Nelson's office? - Who are you? - A friend of his. It's alright, his wife gave me the key. - I don't know... - She also told me to give you this. Sure, that's alright, go ahead mister, go ahead. I spent about an hour there... Mrs Nelson had warned me I wouldn't find much... I didn't. A few dusty letters, a lot of old bills. Nelson apparently had kept his office largely in his hat. Only one thing seemed interesting... A laundry slip with some names scribbled on the back. Didn't take a mind reader to guess they were in Mrs Sirak's handwriting. Off-hand it looked like a list of bookies. At least it was a place to start. - Hi Rocky. - You're a couple of minutes over Jim. Well this is a press card, doesn't that sticker mean anything? Look, don't take it out on me, this ain't my idea. I know. - Real chicken ain't it? - Forget it. The next couple of days after I finished work at the paper... I went calling on the bookies on Nelson's list. About all I learned was... a total stranger could walk in and place a bet anywhere. But on the subject of Nelson... Apparently the word had gotten around. Every place I went, as soon as I mentioned his name they dummied up. I might've dropped it there except for one thing... As I made the rounds I began to notice I had company. I was starting to run out of names when I got to Krug's warehouse. At first I thought I must've made a mistake. I knew Krug, he'd been one of our first advertisers. With a business the size of his... it didn't make sense he'd be making book. - Well Mr Austin. - Hello Mr Krug. You checking up on how the other half lives? Yeah, I guess so in a way. - Hi Krug. - Hello Mr Fowler. Got some new neighbours? Yeah, I had more floor space then I needed... and these fellas came along a few months back, offered me a good rent... so I let them have the other half of the building. Laboratory of some kind, defense work I think. I see. Kinda off your beat ain't it, this part of town? Yeah. Yeah I guess it is. - Anything I can do for you? - No thanks. Well I'll be seeing ya. Drop in any time. It wasn't much but Mr Fowler, Krug's new tenant, interested me. I was sure that somewhere I'd seen his face before. James Austin, I got a parking ticket at the women's club. What's the matter, run out of nickels? Now this isn't funny! What genius filed Roosevelt here under F? Would you pay attention. The officer said that Chief Gillette has withdrawn our press privileges. - That's right. - It is?! Well I'll take care of that! Next time I see Mr Chief Gillette I'll tell him a thing or two. That's fine, you do that. It was right in front of me and I almost missed it... But the name under the halftone wasn't Fowler... It was Dominick Fabretti. Hey Vince, take this will you. - Ok Jim. - It goes to the United Press Wire Service, attention library. Send everything you have on Dominick Fabretti. D-O-M-I-N-I-C-K F-A-B... Kinda dark. Doesn't look like anybody's around. - What's the matter? - I got a rock in my shoe. Maybe we should've worn sneakers. Electrical equipment corporation. - Hey, look at all the phone wires. - Yeah. Must be 20 or 30 of them. - What's on your mind buddy? - Nothing, just looking around. Well look someplace else. Ok since you put it so nicely. Come on Phil. - What do you think it is? - Big bookie drop, that's all it can be. Listen Jim, I can still get a shot. Let Beowulf cover the ball game tomorrow, I'll come over here. - And get your head knocked off? - How would they know? I'd play it smooth, stay under cover. Let me try it Jim, maybe I could even get a shot of Fabretti. We could splash it all over page 1, three columns. - Maybe I could even write the story! - Let's get the picture first. For a kid of 19 I suppose there's nothing... quite as exciting as a set of false whiskers. I'd made clear to Phil he wasn't to do anything. Just keep an eye on the warehouse and call me if Fabretti came in. While Phil went through the motions of working on his jalopy... runners kept coming and going but of the big boy himself there wasn't a sign. Sally drove me down. She simply insisted, so we stopped at their house awhile. - Hello Mrs Austin. - Hi. Here's that stuff from UP. You know that living room sofa of theirs? They've had it all done over in blue. Chintz sort of, you know... Well I thought this was becoming a rather one sided conversation. - What is that? - Fabretti. Listen to this, your request Dominick Fabretti... According to police records... Sicilian US Citizen between 45 and 50 years of age. Known aliases, Dominick Fashi, David Fox, David Fowler. - Fowler? - Yeah! Quiet dresser, avoids limelight... questioned as suspect murder incorporated. Last held in connection with Florida killing. Present whereabouts unknown though believed to be... floating field organizer, race wired gambling syndicate. Police regard highly dangerous hoodlum type. Not wanted currently but open suspect any mafia killing. Mafia affiliation positive, does this answer query? - Cute kid! - Yes, isn't he?! And aren't we coming up in the world though? This puts Kennington right up there with Miami, Los Angeles and Chicago. Maybe this is a stupid question but... Is this what Nelson found out do you think? It could be. Darling let's have dinner out, I've got a lot of work to do. Nice, especially since you already asked me once. Of course that was this morning! I'm sorry. - Dieting? - I guess I wasn't very hungry. Jim, what is the mafia? I've read about it of course, but what is it, really? Well, it originated in Sicily, it used to be called the black hand. A little extortion, a little kidnapping... every now and then a murder... I don't think you'd like them! Lately they've branched out into... vice, smuggling, gambling, narcotics... even duck into legitimate business. You don't hear much about them unless you get in their way and then... Mrs Gillette. - Small world. - Yeah. I was just sitting here thinking... this charming Mr Fabretti could hardly be... right here in town without anyone knowing it. Well we didn't know it. Which brings up many interesting possibilities. Chief Gillette, the mayor, city council... some of our own friends maybe. I'm not sure I like people. Darling, I think you ought to keep this to yourself for a while. Certainly! - In the meantime what happens to you? - I'll be alright. Yeah, that's what they all say. - Let's go home shall we? - Alright. Miss, check please. Some card I am! Making a big joke out of playing detective. Might even get shot. Very funny. By the next afternoon Phil had the carburettor... out and in again at least a dozen times. Once, right after lunch, a car drove in... But again it wasn't Fabretti. Jim. What are you doing here, don't you know it's Saturday? They took simply hours. I spoke to chief Gillette and he says they have nothing against The Journal. That you started it, whatever it is, he says you're trying to make trouble. - Well that's not entirely true. - Well... Jim, Murray Sirak, out here. Murray Sirak? Now Jim, that's something else, what is all this? Vince told one of the girls that, I don't know what he said exactly... but it was something about gangsters and... if you didn't stop we might all be bombed. - A very impressive little plant Don. - Well thank you. Sorry I never dropped in here before. How are you Ms Percy? Very well, thank you Mr... Sirak. You know Murray Sirak, Jim. My partner, Jim Austin. Sure, how are you Jim? Jim, it's been brought to me that... you've been making a few inquiries around town these last few days. Yeah, what sort of inquiries? What are we in for, another reform movement? Not necessarily. Boys, I'm a plain man, suppose I put my cards on the table. I make no secret of what my interests are. People wanna gamble, I furnish them a service. They get a good run for their money and have for the last 15 years. That's very interesting Mr Sirak but what's that got to do with us? I'll try to make myself clear. I'm a good deal older than you are, I've seen reforms come and go. Suppose you do stir up a dust, What'll it get you? Another hundred subscribers. A pat on the back from the so-called better element? Say you yell your heads off... in a week, two weeks, it'll be over, then where are you? Right back where you are now. You can't stop betting, you can't change human nature. In other words, if you want to stop betting, shoot the horses. Right. By coming in now I thought I could save us all a lot of wasted motion. You get something, I get something and we're all happy. Suppose in consideration for allowing an old man to go his way in peace... Is this going to be a proposition? - Now wait a minute! - It's alright. I like a man who says what he thinks, it clears the air. Suppose we cut out a contract for so much advertising. No deal Mr Sirak. I see. I always get along with people... I don't recall our paths having crossed before. - What have you got against me? - Nothing personally. - Then why... - There was a man killed two weeks ago. - Yes? - His name was Clyde Nelson. Nelson? And am I to assume you're connecting his death with me? So far I haven't connected it with anybody. Even so I'd better know friend. - Naturally I intend to protect myself. - Naturally. Do me one favour... I understand that, among others, you called on my ex-wife. Let's leave her out of this shall we. Laid it on kinda strong didn't you? Why waltz with him Don? He knows every move we've made. Jim, I've never interfered in the editorial and I don't intend to now... but can't you take it just a little easy? I thought we were in on this together. We were and we still are but... Well this business has got a whole lot bigger than... just putting the needle to Chief Gillette. - How? - How?! Why you practically accused Sirak of murder. Hello, yeah? Well don't do anything, I'll be right there. I'm not doing anything. But I'm not! - I'm just standing here. - Fine. - Fabretti just pulled in. - Jim. - I hope you know what you're doing. - I've got some kind of an idea. But what's all this gonna get us except a big headache maybe? Don, would you rather take that ad from Sirak? I didn't say that I only... well take it easy, that's all I ask. Stop borrowing trouble will ya. Look, before I do anything... before I run one line of type, we'll talk about it. - How's that? - Fair enough. It turned out to be a long wait. Three hours went by and Fabretti hadn't come out. - I'm sure I saw him go in. - That's his car out front, isn't it? Yeah. Look. No, it's somebody else. Look Jim, maybe you'd better let me drive and you take it. Why? - Well you're kinda old, I mean... - Thanks! What I mean is, if we get into any trouble... well I had the carburettor off quite a few times. Fine time to think of that. Here they come! If this old heap dies you'll have your arm broke twice... Once by them and once by me. - Anybody coming? - I can't see anybody. Look, you pick up your car and I'll meet you at the office. I'm picking up my car and we're both going straight home. - Well can't we stop at the shop? - In the morning Phil, in the morning. I'd sure like to see what I got. Come on, let's get the negative. Jim... the picture. I'm sorry. Did you see what they looked like? No I didn't, it happened so fast. Better let it go for tonight Jim. He's a very lucky boy, aside from those bruises and a cracked rib. I'd keep him in bed for the next day or two Mrs Hardy. Just send the bill to the office doc. I should think so! Grown men exposing a mere boy to a thing like that. Why he might've been killed! It isn't their fault ma, Jim told me to wait until morning. Come straight home but I wanted to see if we got anything. We did too! - Gee I'm sorry Jim. - Forget it. - We'd better go Jim. - We'll see you, take it easy. So long Phil. When Phil went to work for you Mr Austin... you promised to look after him personally. I know I did. Well if this is an example of it I can tell you right now he's not coming back. - Mom! - Never mind young man. I wish you wouldn't so hasty Mrs Hardy... Phil's got a good future with the paper. In the few months he's been with us he's learned a lot. I'd hardly call being beaten up by gangsters much of a future! In fact I'm surprised either of you can look me in the face. - That was a close one. - Yeah. Woke me out of a sound sleep. How about stopping by the house on the way home? - No thanks. - I got some cold beer. - What's on your mind Don? - Ok. You can't say I haven't gone along with you can you? Nope. Then how about you going along with me for a while? - Turn belly up? - No, I didn't say that. What's the matter with you lately Jim, everything I say... Nothing's the matter with me, I just happen to like this town. So do I, only be a little reasonable will you. Every town's got a larceny street in it. What do you wanna do, reform the world or something? Fabretti wasn't bothering you... leave him alone, he'll leave you alone. You're beginning to sound like Murray Sirak. Ok. Ok if you wanna go on being stubborn but don't say I didn't tell you. Good night. Night. All we had to do is leave Fabretti alone and he'd leave us alone. The sad part of it was it made good sense. In the next few days it began to make even more sense. Monday afternoon I came home early. I just got out of my car when... A car... with a Florida license... and two men in it. I told myself I must be mistaken, probably just a coincidence. Anyway, for the time being, I decided I wouldn't say anything to Marge. - Honey, did you order a new telephone? - No. Well somebody did, the repairman just came. - Hi. - Hi. Given you a new instrument. - What's the matter with the old one? - It's out of order. Wait a minute. - What's your name? - Fredericks. - Who sent you out here? - Mr Barclay, the service manager. Here's the order, right here. Kennington Journal, hello? Kenning... What are you people trying to do, tap our phone? Let me see that. Look mister, don't take it out on me, all I do is what they tell me. The order says replace one hand phone. Tell Mr Barclay we'll keep the one that we've got. - Ok, I'll tell him. - On second thought I'll tell him myself. - I wanna see Mr Barclay. - Yes sir. He's busy right now, who shall I say it is? Tell him Austin from the journal. I'll tell Mr Barclay you're here Mr Austin. Hey Jim, you're just the man I wanted to see. Come over here, I wanna talk to you. Listen, what are you trying to stir up going after the bookies? What's the idea? What's it to you Andy? You're in the used car business. Are you kidding?! You know I've got a book over at the lot. - No I didn't. - Yeah I have. I don't handle it myself you understand, one of the boys... It's a sort of service to the customers mostly. Now if you didn't know about this Jim it's just between you and me. Look, what's wrong with it? Everybody's gonna bet once in a while. Why, you must yourself. Look at me, am I a criminal? Is it me you're after? Of course not. Andy, who put you up to this, Sirak? No, no he didn't. Anyway, what's wrong with Sirak? Look, people are gonna bet, they have to bet with somebody. Now do you wanna run Sirak out, have a bunch of hoodlams move in? What makes you think they haven't already? That ain't any of my business... I'm just interested in what's gonna happen to me. Look, you've got a lot of men sweating around this town Jim. Fine, fine, maybe we'll get somewhere. Yeah? Well let me tell you something. I've got a reputation around this town and so have a lot of other people. And we don't intend to be embarrassed... in front of our wives and kids... or anybody else... by any one-horse newspaper. Now just think that over. For your own good Jim, drop it and drop it now! Mr Austin. I'm sorry, Mr Barclay just stepped out. - Did you tell him I was waiting for him? - Yes I did. I see. - Could anyone else help you? - No, no thank you. Marge didn't have much to say that night, I didn't either. Nothing had happened, nothing probably would happen not to people like us. Marge and I had friends. A newspaper editor is a fairly important figure in town. A man's house is his castle. It was no use, I knew I was just kidding myself. No matter how much I tried to avoid it, one fact kept coming back to me. - Is it there again? - Is what there? - The car. - You saw it too. This afternoon, I didn't want to worry you. You can see I'll never do as a western heroine. If the fort's going to be attacked it'll have to be with the lights on. - Honey, this is Kennington not Chicago. - I seem to have heard that before! Darling, sit down, we're going to have a talk. Sally called me this afternoon... - I thought so. - Never mind. Women do have a faint glimmer of intelligence now and then... whether men know it or not. Jim, I know how you feel about this thing... It's the way any decent person should feel. - But I'm frightened. - Of those men in the car? Don't you see darling, that's exactly what they want? Besides, they could've been perfectly harmless. Yes, like the telephone? Darling, I don't know that I want to live like this. Today when I went into town... three people stopped me to ask me what you were doing. I didn't tell them, naturally, I couldn't, I hardly know myself. That makes us even, in a way I don't know either. - Mr Austin, may I come in? - Why yes, of course. This is my wife... Mrs Sirak. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Won't you sit down. - Thank you. I suppose you're wondering why I'm here? It's warm isn't it. - Jim, why don't you... - Would you care for a drink Mrs Sirak? - No thanks. - Are you sure? Well... perhaps a little bourbon. I had a home like this once. You can say it, I'm drunk, I know, I don't care. Your husband brought this on himself Mrs Austin. Thank you, very kind. - Very lucky. - Yes, I know. - You weren't lying to me the other day Mr Austin? - Lying? You made an offer... - You said if I help you perhaps you'd help me. - That's right. This is a new role for me, I believe the word for it is stoolpigeon. If I tell you who killed Nelson will Murray be kept out of it? I'll do the best I can. Funny, yesterday I was suing him and today... I suppose I'm still in love with him. - It doesn't make sense to you does it? - It makes very good sense. - Murray didn't kill Nelson. - Who did? Fabretti, not himself, he doesn't have to, he's too smart for that. If anybody gets in his way he just presses a button... they bring them in from out of town, different people every time. That's the way they work and you can't do anything about it. Nobody can. If Fabretti says kill you, they kill you. - Does Murray know about this? - Of course he knows. I suppose I left him. To an outsider I guess a bookie is just a bookie... there wouldn't seem to make much difference... But it did. How did he happen to get tied up with Fabretti? Two strange men came out the house one night... I shouldn't say strange, Murray was using their wire service... One of them, Fabretti, asked Murray who his partners were... Murray said he didn't have any partners. Then Fabretti grabbed him by the collar and said... "Who are your partners?" like that. From then on the combination owned half of Murray's books. I shouldn't be too hard on him I guess. What could he do? He's in too deep now. He's not a bad man Mr Austin. You may not believe it Mr Austin... but he was a very handsome man when he was younger. Only we... it's all messed up. You'll have to excuse me dear. It's truth night. Mrs Sirak, would you meet with... my lawyer and me in the morning and repeat what you just told me? - A formal deposition? - What for? I want to take it to Chief Gillette and charge Fabretti with murder. And if Gillette won't move on it, I'll take it to the grand jury. Well... I suppose that's why I'm here. Murray Sirak, Austin, I'm sorry to disturb you like this but... Hello Murray. I wish you hadn't done this Margaret. I thought I asked you to leave her out of it. Don't be a fool, I only dropped in for a drink. You may have cause to regret this Austin. Well that was neat and to the point. - Why did you do that? - I'm not much good at hiding in closets. Anyway, he'd know... sooner or later. Look Mrs Sirak, about tomorrow... You know, this could be serious, if you'd like to change your mind... It is Fabretti you're after, not Murray? - Yes. - Nothing else is important. Do you mind if I use your telephone, I'd like to call a cab. I'll take you home. Wouldn't it be better if... Why don't you spend the night here Mrs Sirak. You're both very sweet but don't worry about me... I know what I'm doing. Things were finally breaking my way. By the time I got back from taking Mrs Sirak home... I had the whole thing worked out. With what I had know I could blow the town wide open. - Marge? - Yes. What's the matter darling? Jim, I'm gonna call the police. They're gone, they're not gonna bother us now. - Then what were they doing out there? - Just keeping an eye on me, that's all. Don't you wish that were true. - Darling, what are we going to do? - We're gonna get some sleep. Remember tomorrow I'll have that deposition from Mrs Sirak. Do you have to go on with this? - Someone's gotta stick his neck out. - Well why does it have to be you? Honey, don't you see? It's not just me. If those hoods can park out in front of our house... they can park out in front of anybody's house. I'm afraid I'm not a very public spirited citizen. I wish I were but I'm not. Will you stop! As far as I'm concerned Fabretti can have Kennington. All I'm interested in is you. Well try the laundromat again and if she's not there try her house again. She's probably on her way here. Maybe she woke up sober and changed her mind. We had it all the time when I was with the DA's office. I'll give her 5 minutes more. If she doesn't show up by then I guess I'll have to call it off. Jim, I've just told Don and I may as well tell you. This mess you're stirring up... A lot of us have spent years and no small amount of money to... bring new business and new industries here. We don't propose to stand idly by... while you fellas give this town a bad name. Not and pay for it at the same time. Good morning Joe. And what was that all about? He just canceled his advertising, I'll talk to you later. Jim, instead of bucking this through alone, why don't you be a little smart? Get a group behind you, a committee, give them the ball. They dig into it nobody can come down on you. All you're doing is reporting the facts. Something must've happened to Mrs Sirak, Joe... I never should've let her go home. Excuse me but I'm gonna go out there, talk to you later. Only in the case of serious emergency. Mrs Sirak. Mrs Sirak. That's funny... Her things are here but the bed doesn't seem to have been slept in. Mrs Sirak, Mrs Sirak. Without thinking I went to the phone and asked for the police. Even before they answered I knew what the verdict would be... Suicide. When it was I blew my top. Who's he mad at?! - What's this? - Tomorrow's editorial. Put a head on that would you Les. An open letter to the Chief of Police. Wow. - Think that's too strong Bill? - Not for my money. - The gals just came in. - Yeah, I saw them. - Hear about Mrs Sirak? - Yes, Don just told me. - Jim. - Yeah? - What about this mysterious car? - What car? I told her, the car outside of our house, I'm worried. Jim, I saw your editorial on the lineup, I thought we had an agreement. I thought you were going to let me read anything you wrote... You've got it in your hand right now, why don't you read it. I have read it, here. - We can't print that. - And why not? Look, we've got half the town on our neck right now. - Well Don, read the rest of it. - I have read it. You know I feel badly about Mrs Sirak's death too and about Nelson. But can you prove Nelson's death wasn't an accident? Can you prove Mrs Sirak didn't kill herself. - No. - No and yet you want to print... "Kennington has not merely been threatened by gangsters... it has already been taken over by gangsters." Alright, even if it were true. Jim, why don't you let the police handle it? Are you kidding? They don't want to handle this, they don't want any part of it. Because Gillette happens to be under Sirak's thumb. Jim, I don't want to butt into your end of the paper... but I've got to know what we're doing. After all, we're in business. Don, what has business got to do with this? A great deal unfortunately, you heard Covolli today. Yeah, and I'll tell you the real reason why Covolli pulled that ad... Because the cigar store down at the Covolli building... happens to be making book... and he gets twice the rent from them than he does from anyone else. I don't care about that, that is not our problem. Our job is to put out a newspaper. And a newspaper's job is to tell the truth. I'm sick of walking a tightrope. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil... just because it might be bad for business. Jim, I hate to say it but you're behaving like a kid. It isn't only Covolli, two other advertisers pulled out today. Besides, we've had a kid beaten up... four dealers called and said they didn't want to handle the paper anymore. You're making a sound like little Eva... with the bloodhounds chasing us across the ice. I can't take the chance Jim. I can't let you take the chance. And that sounds a little bit like an ultimatum. Only if you want to take it that way. - And suppose I do want to take it that way. - Jim! Ok, if you're gonna... if you're gonna go on, beating your head against a brick wall... somebody is gonna have to buy somebody out. And what with? I've always wanted to get acquainted with a banker... I've just never had the right suit. Well of course to me all this is plain silly. Ok Don. Tell me, is this paper of yours going to be all ads... or you gonna print some news too? Are you crazy? What are you gonna do? I'm gonna go out and make some news, front page. Now who let you in? - I wanna file a complaint. - Against who? - Dominick Fabretti. - On what grounds? Look, I told you this morning, we can't pull anybody in on just your say-so. Why, right now Fabretti's got a dozen witnesses that'll... swear he wasn't within 100 miles of here when Mrs Sirak was rubbed out. - We couldn't hold him for 4 hours. - You admit she was murdered then? Of course she was murdered and so was Nelson... I don't need you to tell me that do I? Why didn't you say so before? And have you blabbing it all around town? Look, the thing you can't seem to get through your head is that... making a charge of murder is one thing and making it stick is another. These hoods... Well pick them up on bookmaking then... I understand that's still against the law in this state. Don't be silly will you... and so is riding a bicycle on the sidewalk, a misdemeanor. So I pick him up for bookmaking... and some real hard-boiled judge socks him with a $50 fine. And what do you get with that. I'm sorry chief, somebody's gonna make a pinch. If you can't handle it alright but it's gonna make quite a story if... I have to do it myself, as a citizen's arrest. Notify all cars, Dominick Fabretti, I want him picked up. - Fabretti? - Yeah. - I'll let you know when they bring him in. - No sale chief. Austin, why don't you run your business and let me run mine. I wanna save you a lot of trouble, come on... I'll show you where Fabretti hangs out. - Lou, cover the back and the other side. - Yes sir. Alright boys, let's go in. - What goes on here? - Where's Fabretti? Fabretti? I don't know any Fabretti? This is your property isn't it? Sure it's my property but I don't know anything about this. I made my deal with a man named Fowler. If you wanna come up to the office I'll show you the lease. Howard, pick up those markers and scratchies and hold them for evidence. Sergeant, answer that phone will you. And if somebody wants to put a bet, write down the conversation. And disconnect those phones and bring them in too. Chief, there's nothing outside. Go knock yourselves out boys, you made it look good. Take over Lou. Well sonny boy, you happy now? I wonder who tipped them off. I've been trying to answer that same question for 5 years... and don't ask me why I haven't closed them up before. What'd be the use? They'd be open again in a couple of weeks. Austin, it might interest you to know... I don't like this situation here any better than you do. I don't like the position it puts me in. I don't like what it does to my men. But what do you want me to do? Quit my job? When I came here first about 10 years ago... I went to the city parlors, some of the merchants, lawyers, real estate men... And I asked them what kind of a town they wanted me to run. Well it kinda surprised me. I meant Sirak and they knew I meant Sirak... so it turned out they wanted me to be strict but not too strict. Well I tole them then that if they're going to have gambling... they're going to open their doors to all the gangsters. You start with a Sirak and you wind up with a Fabretti. It's as simple as two and two. So you see, it's not up to me, I'm just giving the people what they want. You know something, I don't believe you. I don't believe that this is what people want. You sure learn the hard way don't you? Some things yeah. I'll be seeing you. - Well don't you even want a ride back to town? - No thanks, I'll walk. Well I was stopped, stopped in my tracks... But I still couldn't believe there wasn't somebody who hadn't sold out. That afternoon I had my friend Rev. Nash call a meeting of the ministers. If I couldn't handle it myself I'd take it to somebody who could. In other words gentlemen, bookmaking in Kennington is not just a simple, local conspiracy, not any more. To show more clearly what I'm talking about... I'd like you to take a look at this chart. It's a rough diagram showing the chain of command of a $3 billion... gambling and bookmaking empire that spread across the country. We start at the top, we have a handful of ex-gangsters... former bootleggers and unconvicted murderers... absolute rulers of a state within a state. Here are the regional bosses. Ex-hoodlums like Dominick Fabretti... who's in charge of the racing wire service in this state. Then we get down through hundreds of... local bookmaking syndicates like Murray Sirak's. Completely dominated by the wire service, Sirak's day is only a front. So, whether we like it or not... it seems to me that we here in Kennington face a choice. Either we accept a future more and more dominated by... graft, corruption and controlled by the mafia... or we do something about it. - May I say something Jim? - Certainly Rev. Nash. I see that you're all shocked by what you heard here and you should be. That's why I hesitate... I feel I must apologise to you Jim for bringing this up at this time. For several years now I've been police chaplain in this town so... I probably know what goes on in the city hall than the rest of you. Frankly I can tell you right now... if you're thinking of the usual peanut campaign... which means chiefly a police investigation... you'll never touch the real offenders. What do you mean by that? Simply that, to my definite knowledge... Chief Gillette is a competent officer and a thoroughly honest man but... he can only run the sort of city his superiors tell him to run. Are you saying Chief Gillette allows... bookmaking to flourish here because he's ordered to? Exactly gentlemen. I deplore what I've listened to in this room this afternoon as much as you do. But I'm telling you that if there is a reform movement in this city... it's utter hypocrisy and a crime to... direct it against a few individual bookies... while those who rent spaces to these bookies... sell them legal services, supply them with telephones and... all the other facilities of a legitimate business go entirely Scot free. I for one would be very happy to participate... if you will agree in advance to expose all the so-called... respectable elements in this town who make Sirak and his activities possible. Frankly... I have no faith in that happening. I don't think any of us are in a position to... take on our own congregations. The next thing I remember... they say alcohol never cured anybody of anything... but when your legs have been cut off at the knees believe me, it helps. It was 11 o'clock, what I came to the office for I have no idea now... force of habit I guess. For a while I just sat there... I suppose I imagined I was thinking about what I'd do next. "Kefauver crime committee opens in capitol." That's almost funny, if they tried they couldn't have timed it better. The marines have landed, the situation is well in hand. The only thing wrong with the picture was... the situation was all over, finished. Hello. Hello darling. Jim, where on earth have you been? - Walking around?! - I'm sorry, I guess I should've phoned. Yep, they turned me down... cold. Well I'm alright, don't worry about it. I said don't worry about it, I'll be alright. Darling, I just got an idea. Throw a shirt and some socks into a bag for me will you. The senate crime investigation opens up in the capitol tomorrow and... I just thought that maybe I... I'll talk to you later. - So you're going to the capitol? - That's right. You busybodies are all alike, you never know when you've had enough. I told you didn't I, I told you you'd be wasting your time. Now what did you accomplish except to cause the death of an innocent woman. - That I'm sorry about. - She was a fine person. I should've taken her advice long ago now... I tried to protect her, it was taken out of my hands. Is this what you came in here to tell me? Austin, you don't deserve this but I've persuaded my people to... let me have one more chance to try to make a deal with you. - Why? - Because I don't believe in the use of force. There's enough here for everybody. - Now that you understand what you're up against. - In other words... I can take you advertising or... I can deal with the hoods that Fabretti's got parked outside my house. I hadn't intended to put it that way. But that's what it amounts to isn't it? Yes. I'll think it over. In the meanwhile run up to the capitol? I'm afraid that won't be very satisfactory, I want your answer now. Alright, tell Fabretti to go fly a kite. I wonder if you realise just what you're saying. These people can be patient but only up to a certain point. I'm afraid that point's been reached. Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. If I were you I'd keep it very much in mind. Marge and I left for the capitol about midnight... As far as we could see there was nobody around. Like a lot of people I'd said to myself... This couldn't happen, not in Kennington, not to us. But it was happening... in Kennington. Hey buddy, how do I get to the Edwards Hotel? - Turn right at the next intersection, you can't miss it. - Thanks a lot. By dawn the next day we'd covered 300 miles. - Get any sleep? - A little. Want me to drive for a while? - How about a cup of coffee. - If you think it's ok. Almost out of gas anyway. Cross your fingers, maybe they decided I wasn't worth the trouble. - Morning. - Fill it up will you, we'll be inside. - Morning folks, What'll it be? - Just coffee. - Same. - Be with you in a minute. Jim! You got 16 gallons. Get the road map out of the glove compartment. How far's the next town? It's... Here it is, about 8 miles, a place called Warren. Well, that's the story. As I said, we're in the police station in Warren. For the moment we seem to be safe enough... If our luck holds out we'll get to the Capitol. What comes of that I have no idea. My only feeling is that this must be told to somebody... somebody big enough to do something about it. Not because of us but because, as things now stand... - What happened to us could happen to you, to almost anyone. - Jim. - You the folks that want an escort? - Yeah. - We'll take you. - Fine, I'll be right with you. - Sergeant. - Yeah. This is for the tape. - And... hang on to it will you, just in case. - Sure thing. Well, I guess you don't need us anymore. - No, thanks very very much. - Sure, glad to do it. Miss, my name is Austin, James T. Austin. Yes Mr Austin, the committee got your wire, they're expecting you. - Stairway to the left, room 203. - Thank you. What's the matter Jim, what's that? Mr James Austin, please report to the committee room... Mr Austin, please report to the committee room. My name is Estes Kefauver, for over a year it was my privilege to... serve as chairman of the Senate Crime Investigative Committee. I'm happy to report to you that the real life James Austin was not killed. He is still alive, still doing a courageous job... an outstanding member of his profession. As a consequence of Austin's bold action and the resulting glare of publicity... the aroused citizens of Kennington demanded... and now have an honest and responsible administration. I'm sure we all realise by this time... that no big time organized public gambling is possible anywhere... unless some susceptible, local official or official have been paid off. By these payoffs the underworld creates a vicious circle. Gambling yields large profits, these profits make more money for payoffs... More payoffs mean a deeper and deeper penetration by the underworld... into our political and economic system. Just remember, there's no such thing as a little, harmless, local vice. A little organized gambling. Multiply a little organized crime by 1000... and you have a vicious, powerful, nationwide, criminal syndicate. Basically, stamping out crime is not just a national problem... it is largely a local matter, a local responsibility. Cut off the crime dollar at it's source in your own town... and the crime syndicate will shrivel and die. But it's up to you!
