[Dogs Barking, People Yelling, Indistinct] [Speaking In German] [Barking Continues] [Yelling In German] [Speaking German] No! No! No! [Woman] No! [Screaming Fades] [Panting] Yadwiga? [Klezmer] [Continues] Yadwiga? - Yadwiga? - Good morning. - What time is it? - It's 10:00. I do shopping. I iron your shirt and underwear. I clean kitchen floor and bathroom. I had my breakfast, but I'm ready to eat again with you. Would you like perhaps tea? Oh, no, no. Herman, you cannot go with barefoot. I get your slippers. I polish them. - Polish them? Who polishes slippers? - They were all dried up. Ay-yi-yi-yi, Yadzia. This is America. Huh? Huh? You're not the family servant anymore. I fill your bathtub now. [Humming] I buy you a soap. Perfume soap. Smell. Three for a dime. Come. I wash you. Oh, if we were to have a boy Praise the Lord on high In what would we cradle our joy Praise the Lord on high In the street belo-o-ow In the street belo-o-ow There is a tub of snow - What time does the train leave? - What? At, uh, 2:00. - Where's the city? - Philadelphia? In America. Where should it be? Why don't you sell books here? There are so many people. People come to Coney Island for popcorn, not books. - What kind of books are they? - Books on how to build bridges... how to lose weight, how to run the government. Books of songs, stories, plays, the life of Hitler. They write books about such swine? They write about all kinds of swine. Tonight I'll be having supper in Philadelphia. Who you eat with? - Alone? - [Speaking Yiddish] Talk so I can understand you. Matzi, Pitzele! Pitzele! [Laughing] Hey, Pitzele! The neighbor with the white hair said I could earn $25 a week in a factory. You want to go to work? You have to know how to read and write. So you take the course. I will enroll you. Herman! [Scoffs] Herman! The old woman says you must know the alphabet first. - I will teach you. - When? You are never at home. Such a sweet girl, that Yadwiga. [Man] Vito Marcantonio to run for mayor! Read all about it! Marcantonio to run for mayor here! - Yes, sir? Five cents. - Forverts. [Grunts] [Thinking: Dogs Barking, People Shouting] [Barking, Woman Screaming] [Shouting, Indistinct] [Voices Stop] You're supposed to report first thing in the morning. Where's my speech for Atlantic City? If I had to depend on you, I'd be an unemployed rabbi. I got six convalescent homes to worry about, not to mention apartments... in Borough Park, Williamsburg. I'm sick and tired of you living in a house without a telephone. Oy, such a greenhorn. I know, I know. You live with an old tailor who saved your life in Poland... and he desperately needs your rent money to live. A sob story. Let me see this. Now you're starting to write. This is great. Great. What's with the scribbling here? Where's the rest of it? If you can't finish it, tell me. I'll get somebody else. I'll talk into a Dictaphone myself. I'll have Mrs. Regal type it. E-Everything will be ready today. I promise that. I hope so. Meanwhile, I'll hold on to this. Now, once and for all, your address. - Where do you live? Under Yankee Stadium? - [Both Laughing] I'm beginning to believe that you got a wife... - and you're hiding her from me. - I wish I had the wife. If you want one, you could have one. I picked out a fine woman for you. You wouldn't even meet her. What are you afraid of? You wait long enough, you'll marry a shiksa. The subject for my next speech... "Mixed marriages: The plague of theJews." Now... are you going to finish this? And are you going to give me your address? Because if you don't, I'm gonna have to fire you. This town is lousy with bookworms. Everyone wants to be a ghostwriter. L... Thirty-nine eighteen Pelham Drive. - In-In the Bronx. - What's the name of the old tailor? - Pracz. - Tell him to put in a phone and send the bill... - No, no. You can't do that. - Why? - You can't install one without his consent. - Why should he care? The ringing frightens him. It reminds him of Auschwitz. - There are other refugees, and they have telephones. - Well, l-l... It'll be good for him. Put it in your room. In case he gets sick... he could call a doctor, maybe get help. Lunatics. Crazy people. That's why Hitlers rise up. Look, I wanted us to be friends. But there's something about you that makes it very difficult. I could help you a great deal, but you close up like a clam. Uh, maybe. Maybe I am no longer a part of this world. Clich?s. Empty words. I know hundreds of concentration camp survivors... some of them practically on the way to the oven, but they're doing fine. They drive cars, they do business and they have telephones. Maybe that's my problem. I was hiding in a barn. Look, I don't want to force my friendship on you. But I'm calling today and having them install a telephone. Sno-cones! Get your sno-cones! Five-cent sno-cones! Sno-cones! Get your sno-cones! Five-cent sno-cones! [Fading] - [Coughing] Ohh. - My mother. Oh, Herman. Herman. You know... I've got in the habit of sitting down and falling right off to sleep. - Did I sleep long? - She walks around the house as quiet as a mouse. There are real mice here. I can't tell the difference anymore. You're starting again. What is burning? - Masha, I smell something is burning. - Nothing is burning, Mama. She blames me for everything that happens. That's right. The whole world is-is sane... - and it's only your mother that's crazy. - Don't put words in my mouth. You listen to how she's carrying on? She always has to say something contrary. She's just like her father. May he rest in peace in the Garden of Eden. - [Coughing] - Masha? Masha? Water. [Coughs] It's her fault, you know. It's all her fault. She wouldn't let me die. I thought she was dead too. And then one day, she finds me. The next day, she's already talking back to me. Then she marries this man, this Leon Tortshiner. Oy. Is that a charlatan! You know, my daughter, she can read the most difficult books. When it comes to people, she doesn't know her hands from her feet. Now look. She's left sitting here, a deserted wife. If I want to get married, I won't wait for a divorce. Oh... [Sniffs] What is happening with that stove? Masha, I smell there's something burning here! Look at this! Oh, my God! There isn't a drop of water left in this pot! If God could allow theJews of Europe to be killed... what reason is there to believe... he would prevent the extermination ofJews in America? God doesn't care. - Right, Herman? - Who knows? Will you leave Herman alone? First you burn the meat... and now you're bothering and pestering him with these questions. Maybe suffering is an attribute of God. Mama baked some cookies. I'll bring you some. - No. First he has to eat the compote. - What's the difference what he... - Stop it. Stop fighting. What... - It all gets mixed up. Will you two stop quarreling? If you two can't live together peacefully... how can there ever be peace on the Earth? The last two people on Earth, they would kill each other. How can you understand God? - You shouldn't argue with her so much. - She infuriates me. She's more devoted to material things than any atheist. First she tells me to marry Leon Tortshiner... because he brings her little cakes. Later, she finds fault with him. God knows why. What difference was it to me who I marry? After all I'd been through, what would it matter? Speaking of marriage, how is your little peasant? Did you tell her you were on a book-selling trip again? - Tonight, I'm in Philadelphia. - And what happens if she finds out about us? - She'll never find out about us. - There's always the possibility. She will never separate us. If you can spend so much time with an illiterate goose... perhaps you don't need anything better. And what sense is there in doing the dirty work for that swindler of a rabbi? - At least become a rabbi. Swindle in your own name. - I can't do that. - Here's the compote. It's delicious. - Thanks. The truth is, you're still hiding in that hayloft. Yep. That's the truth. This is very good. This is... This is very good. [Train Rumbling By] [Rumbling Rises In Intensity] [Train Wheels Screeching] [Panting] [Moaning] I don't believe your peasant is really as cold as you say she is. - Well, don't believe it. - What about your first wife? Did you love her? - Tamara is dead. - Suppose I were to die? Or commit suicide? How long would you remember me? How long would you wait before finding another? Just this once... be honest. How long would you wait? I would never have anyone again. - Is that the truth? - Yes, you devil. The whole truth. [Both Laughing] - [Laughing] - Suppose... Suppose that there were no men left on the Earth. - Mm-hmm. - Would you do it with a woman? Sure. Why not? Would you do it with a man? - No. Absolutely not. Out of the question. - Why? - Why? No. - You know why? - Because then I wouldn't find my other half. - [Laughs] But an animal... [Moaning] - [Both Laughing] - You get me a nice sheep or a goat... - Mmm! That's another story, you know. - [Laughing] - You ever do it with a guard? - Never. Not that they weren't interested. Of course, there was this lieutenant at Dachau. No. Never. Never, never. It's time to go to work, Herman. - Before work comes pleasure. - I have to go. I have to go. [Mumbles] [Both Laughing] [Humming] Yadzia? Let's take a holiday. [Applauding] [Speaking Polish] [Replies In Polish] Want one pink one. [Bell Rings] - [Man] All right, we got a balloon going up. - [Chattering] - [Talking, Indistinct] - [Shouting, Indistinct] [Herman] Hit the hole! Hit the hole! - [Bell Ringing] - Yeah! I won! I won! We have a winner! We have a winner! Mister, you have a winner! All right! We got a winner! [Screaming] [Laughing, Screaming] [Chattering] I'm so happy. So lucky. God himself has sent you to me. [Siren Blaring] - [People Screaming] - Herman, please. I want to become a Jew. I want to have your child. [Barking] - [Laughing] - They drag animals here from all over the world... - and put them in cages. - My cage was not this comfortable. Yeah. - I have to call Yadwiga. - Call her. - Don't be angry. - Call her. But if you love me, you'll take me to the Catskills for my vacation... just like you promised. I promise. L-I must stay here in Baltimore another day. [Animal Roars] Uh, in a bookstore. - I'm in a bookstore. - [Animals Growling] - Uh, what? - [Bird Chirping] It's, uh, it's a jungle book store. That's right... No. Oh, sure. There are jungles in Baltimore. [Roars] I know that, sweetheart. L-I know. - L-I miss you too. - [Roars] I will. Listen. I will... I will... I will call you tomorrow. I promise you. That's right. Bye-bye. [Kissing] Y-Y-You... Say hello to the birds for me. Yeah, bye-bye. "Yadzia." Come home with me and I'll show you something your Yadzia would blush at. - [Roaring] - [Roaring] Would you still want me... - if we both died young... - Oh, Masha. And were buried in the same plot and I came to you... - in your grave? - [Moans] Would you still want me? Always. Always, Masha. [Groans] Herman? Herman? - Herman, wake up. - Mm. Herman, Masha says she's gonna meet you in the cafeteria at 12:00. And, uh... they're looking for you in the newspaper. See? Nowadays, when someone is looked for in the newspaper... it's no small matter. [Talking, Indistinct] [Baby Crying] Come in, Mr. Broder. A miracle from heaven, Broder. A miracle. Call her in. Your wife has returned. Hello, Herman. I didn't know that you were alive. That's something you never knew. [Door Closes] - Our children? - Dead. Sit. Sit down. Th-Th-They told me that you were killed by a-a-a... - a firing squad. - They shot two bullets into me. One is still here in my body. It's as if you've... you've risen from the dead. We were dumped in an open pit, hundreds of us. They thought we were all dead. But I crawled over some corpses and escaped at night. It was raining or the Nazis would have seen me. Then I fled to Russia. I lived in the woods, for years. How was it my uncle didn't know where you were? We had to put an advertisement in the paper. L-I don't have my own apartment. I live with someone else. What do you do? Where do you live? I didn't know that you were alive. - I think... - Who's the lucky woman who has taken my place, Herman? She isn'tJewish. She, uh... She's the daughter of the Pole in whose house I lived during... during the war. A peasant? Who is she? She was our servant. You knew her. Uh... Yadwiga. Yadwiga? You married her? [Chuckles] Forgive me. Wasn't she a little simple-minded? I remember she didn't know how to put on a pair of shoes. Your brother used to tell me how she used to put the left shoe on the right foot. Tamara. - She saved my life. - Was there no better way to repay her? [Chuckles] Sorry. I shouldn't ask. Do you have any children by her? Children? No. Well, it wouldn't shock me if you did. I assumed you crawled into bed with her even when you were with me. That's nonsense. I never crawled into bed with her with anyone. - Oh, really? - No. We never really did have a marriage. All we did was argue. What was I supposed to do? One minute, you were a Trotskyite... You never had any respect for me, for my ideas. That's not true. You know that. Why don't you have any children by her? Why are you looking at me like that? You married her. Well, maybe for one minute there I thought... I says... I said... well, maybe-maybe you have changed. - But I see you haven't changed. You're still the same. - No. - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. - No, I'm not the same. No, I'm not the same. I'm dead. They put nylon stockings on me, dyed my hair, polished my fingernails. God help me. But I'm dead. So I bear no grudges against anyone. - Nor am I dependent on anyone. - No. But with... I just hope you're not playing the same tricks on your wife... - I am not... - that you played on me. I don't know where you're living, Broder, but you may stay with us. Uncle, he has another wife. There was an eyewitness who-who said that... They testified that she... - You don't have to run away, Herman. - L... I'm not going to trap you into anything. - That's what we read in the newspapers. - Yeah. - Why didn't you tell us? - Well, I didn't want to trouble you, that's all. All right, so it's not so terrible. You didn't know she was alive, so you weren't living illegally with a woman. And I'm sure that you will, as soon as possible... - I'll do... wh-whatever... - What do you want to do, Herman? - You want to divorce me? - No. No. - Oh, what should I do, move in with your new wife? - Uh... no. Look, I, uh... I don't know. L... Look, l-I have to run. L-l... I'm sorry. I would like to stay. But it's, uh... I have a pressing business engagement down at... I'm late. Uh... I'm-I'm-I'm writing a book for-for a rabbi. It's, uh... l-I think you would be interested in it. It's, uh, it's very complicated, and it's, uh... [Sighs] But l-l-I have to go now. You'll have to excuse me. L... I'm sure... What I'll do, I will call you. It's, uh... I will... I will be in touch with you. [Door Opens] - [Door Closes] - Why did he get into the bathroom? You were with a relative, huh? - I didn't even know he was alive. - What's his name? Feivl. Feivl Lemberger. - A Talmudic scholar in his sixties. - You think I'm an idiot? I know who it is. It's that old girlfriend of yours, Eva Kracover. - She's been after you since Warsaw. - Masha, Masha, Masha. - Masha, great game. - Thanks, Benny. Two teas, Bernie. It is Eva. She missed you so badly, she put a notice in the personals. You were so afraid I'd see the name and number, you tore it out of my mother's paper. - How do you know that? - My mother called me, that's how I know. But I got another one. I'm going to call right now and find out the truth. - You want to call? You go ahead, call. - Yes! I will give you the nickel. You call. I'm bored to death with your ugly accusations. - All the time, it's the same thing... - Don't let her push you around. - I'll call when I feel like it. - If you have no faith in me... - then the whole relationship is senseless. - It's senseless, all right. [Man] That's right. Go on, you tell him. You have your shiksa and you have me, but some bitch from Europe shows up... and you leave to run off to meet her. A whore like that probably has syphilis too. - I haven't seen Eva in years! - I don't know why I stay with you. You're a pathological liar and a bastard besides! Russians. They're hot-blooded. Masha. Masha. Tamara, my dead wife, risen from the grave. Polished her nails, come to New York. That's the truth. You know, Herman, compared to you, Leon Tortshiner was an honest man. And after all this, I was gonna tell you... I can take my vacation now. - Starting when? - We can leave Sunday morning. Oh, boy. Listen. L-I don't know. I don't know, Masha. This is... This is not a good time for me. It's a very bad time. You did it deliberately. All year you promised to take me to the country... - It's still a promise. I will... - and at the last minute... - you change your mind! - What are you hitting me for? I'll go myself. I don't need you. I'll pack a suitcase and go wherever my eyes lead me. Don't threaten me. I will take you to the country. Masha... [Sighs] [Swing] A certain maid I know is so afraid her beau Will never ask her Will she name the day He calls on her each night And when she dims the light It's ten to one that you will hear her say Oh, Joseph, Joseph Won't you make your mind up Oh, Joseph Make your mind up It's time I knew just how I stand with you [Tamara] My uncle keeps nagging me to come to a decision. He says you should divorce the other one. If not, you should divorce me. I can't get a Jewish divorce from Yadwiga. We weren't married underJewish law. Are you at least faithful to her or do you have six others? [Mumbling] Tamara, you know... You might as well tell me everything. It's pointless to hide now. Ja, ja. I have a mistress. I thought so. What can you talk about with Yadwiga. Who is she? She's from over there. From the camps. Twenty cents grapes, please. - Well, I see nothing has changed with you. - Ja, ja, ja. - Thank you. - This sweetheart of yours... does she accept this arrangement? She has no choice. Her husband won't divorce her. She's in love with me. Are you in love with her? I can't live without her. Well, well, well. To hear such words from you. Is she beautiful? Intelligent? Charming? - All three. - How do you manage it? Do you rush from one to the other? I do the the best I can. It's not so easy. What sort of person is your mistress? A little crazy, but tremendously interesting. - Children? - No. And she doesn't want any. You're lying, Herman. If a woman loves a man, she wants to have his child. She wants to be his wife too. And not have him run off with another woman. - Does she know about me? - She read the notice in the paper. She could call here at any time. What shall I say if she calls? That I'm your sister? I told her that you were alive. She didn't believe me. Then I told her a cousin of mine showed up. A... A man called Feivl Lemberger. Shall I tell her that I am Feivl Lemberger? [Moans] Go. Go have Sabbath with your wife. [Laughing] [Speaking Hebrew] [Speaking Hebrew] - Good Shabbes. - Good Shabbes. Was good? It was good. - [Sighs] - Herman! - You're breaking God's commandment. - [Scoffs] There is no God, do you hear? And if there were, I would defy him. [Speaking Polish] [Speaking Polish] Besides, if there were a God, he wouldn't care about lighting the lights on the Sabbath. Yadzia, tomorrow, I'm... I must go to Pittsburgh. It's a long trip. Have you slept with her yet? - Who? - Feivl Lemberger. [Sighs] Not yet. Who is she? You might as well tell me the truth. I told you the truth. Tamara's alive. She's here. Tamara is dead and rotting in the earth. Feivl is one of your sweethearts. I swear on the bones of my parents. It isn't my sweetheart. - Then tell me who she is. - I told you. I to... - Who is she? - It's a relative of mine, huh? A broken woman who has lost her children. - Why did you say Feivl Lemberger? - Why? Why did I say Feivl? Because I know you. I know how suspicious you are. If I just mentioned a woman, what... Let me ask you a question. Do you really think that Reb Abraham Nissen Yaroslaver... would put a notice in the paper for a sweetheart of mine? They're pious people. Masha, I've had it up to here. You don't believe me, you call them yourself. You find out for yourself. - Well, maybe this time you're innocent. - Ah, maybe. Ja, ja, ja. - No. Not so easy to make up. - You'll never believe what I've been through these last days. You little idiot, you. I love you, you know. [Chattering] Where are the Nazis? What kind of world is this without Nazis? A backward country, this America. - [Radio] - It's very clear - Our love is here to stay - Our love is here to stay - Not for a year - Not for a year - Forever and a day - Forever and a day - And the radio - And the radio - And the telephone - And the telephone - And the movies that we know - And the movies that we know - May just be passing fancies - May just be passing fancies - And in... That lady can sing, huh? - And in time may go Time may go - But, oh, my dear - But, oh, my dear - Our love is here to stay - Our love is here to stay - Together we're - Come on, Yeshiva boy, let's see what you can do. - Goin'a long - Together [Laughs] - Going a long long way - The Rockies may tumble - Gibraltar may tumble - In time the Rockies may crumble - Gibraltar may tumble - But our love is here to stay But our love is here To stay [Humming] Yadzia, I'm in Pittsburgh. No, Pitt... Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. That's right, that's right. No, I'm working as fast as I can. No, I promise not to stay away too long. You miss her. You can hardly wait to go back with her again. She's all alone. She's helpless. What about me? - This is my vacation. - Of course, of course. We're here one night and you go running to the phone to call your peasant. You lied to her, and you will lie to me. I don't ever want to see you again. Ever! - [Applause] - [Man, Indistinct] [Thinking: Man Speaking German] - [Thinking: Dogs Barking] - No. No. - [Man Speaking, Dogs Barking, Continues] - No. No! [Herman] No! No! No! No! [Voices Louder, Woman Screaming] - [Voices Fading] - [Sobbing] - This is not the way. - [Chuckling] What is the way? Where was I five years ago this time? Still among the dead. - [Rumba] - [Man] Okay. What we're doing here is the rumba. We're doing the box step. Everybody follow me. And left and back. It's left, front and side. And back and one and two and back and three. - [Yells] - Everybody dance. Everybody do the rumba. That's it. Left and right. Down slow. Now back up. Up. Down one more time. Down. Good. [Chattering] Did you see A Double Life? Oh, what an actor that Ronald Colman is. Such a voice. Such a fine nose. Give meJohn Garfield. Now there's an actor. Not to mention he's Jewish. - I heard that Ronald Colman's alsoJewish. - Ohh. I had a relative named Broder. A third cousin, from Lemberg. Or was it Tarnow? - [Man On P.A.] Lunch is served in five minutes. - I think it was Drohobycz. - Lunch. Excuse me. - Oh, Lunch. Lunch. [Man On P.A.] Please, no bathing suits in the dining room. - I repeat, please... - Herman. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? What are you doing here? I'm coming here, uh, always. I always come here. - Ah. - To write. I'm writing here. - Ah. Must be a good place for that. - Oh. Yeah, yeah. - This is our second visit here. - Excellent kosher food. - Why don't you join us for lunch? - Oh, no, l... - It's the boiled beef today. - No. That wouldn't be possible. I'm sorry. Is your wife here? Oh, that? That. Uh... Oh, of course not. What would she be doing here? I'm coming here... I come here to work. Work, work, work. You know, deadlines. It, uh... I don't have to tell you. You know about, uh... I'll... Dinner. Maybe we'll have dinner together. If you'll be here, we'll have dinner. - Uh, I'm-I'm sure it was Drohobycz. - It could be. He will never come for dinner. [Man's Voice] Philip Bronstein, your mother wants you in the bungalow now! Anybody who lost a set of keys on the beach... they're in the office. The keys are in the office. Sadie Reuben is looking for a canasta party. Anybody interested, contact her at bungalow number 17. Whoever took the paddles for Ping-Pong... and didn't return them, please do so to the office immediately. Remember, folks, tonight at 8:30 in the casino... - Excuse me. - We'll have dancing to the Mitch Felson Trio. - Masha. - Herman, what are you doing? I'm so hungry. - Let's go for a ride. - They're having the boiled beef today. - Yeah, I heard. I'm not hungry. Come on. - I'm starving. It should be cooler on the lake. Come on. Come on. Get in. Get in. Come. Come. Get in. Get in. Get into the boat. Come on. Row. Row. Row, Masha, row. Masha, row, row, row. Row the boat. Row! [Man On P.A.] ...you got a long-distance call from your husband. It's been seven weeks since I've had my visitor. I'm never late. - You'll go. You'll see a doctor. - They can't tell so soon. I'll wait another week. An abortion in America costs $500. And it's dangerous too. A woman in the cafeteria got blood poisoning and that was the end of her. What an ugly way to die. And what would my mother do if anything happened to me? - I'm sure you would let her starve. - [Sighs] Masha, Masha. Don't get melodramatic. You don't even know if you're pregnant yet. - Herman? - Hm? I'm afraid of an operation. - Herman? - Don't worry. It'll be all right. Perhaps Leon will divorce me. I'll speak frankly to him. - If he won't divorce me, the child will bear his name. - I can't divorce Yadwiga. You can't? When the King of England wanted to marry the woman he loved... he gave up his throne, and you can't get rid of a stupid peasant? - You know a divorce would kill Yadwiga. - I know nothing of the sort. - You married her in a civil ceremony. - Oh, Masha. - Marry me in a Jewish ceremony. - Oh, I can't. - I don't need their gentile papers. - Oh, Masha. - I can't... I can't do that. - Why? Why? Why? It would be bigamy, that's why. - It would be worse. It would be polygamy. - No one will ever know. - Yeah, so... - As long as there's no marriage certificate... - no one can prove that we're man and wife. - That-that... Let me finish. If you won't agree, you can leave this minute. I'll find a doctor who will perform the operation. - But don't you ever show your face to me again. - Oy, Masha, Masha. I'll give you one minute to answer. [Flushes] - You're asking me... - One minute. You're asking me to break the law. I would be afraid of every policeman. - You're afraid anyhow. - That's right. That's right. - Answer me! - I told you, yes! Yes! Yes! But our baby would be a bastard anyway, according to theJewish law. It was conceived before the divorce. Jewish law and all the other laws... mean as much to me as last year's frost. I'm only doing it for my mother. I've wanted your child since the day we met. [Humming] [Knock On Door] [Knocking] [Resumes Humming] - Herman. - I'm marrying again. A third wife? Who? Masha. I thought she already had a husband. She's divorcing him. She's pregnant. Well, congratulations. You're going to be a father again. - I'm going crazy. That's the truth. - Were you always like this? Or did the war do it? I can't remember what kind of person you used to be. I can't believe you've come to me under these circumstances. Tamara, please. My head is exploding. Come in. I'll get you something to eat. [Door Closes] [Both Sigh] - You remember my cousin Isaac? - Ja, ja. Yeah? Well, he married Helen Edela. They met again in the camp. - Helen Ede... - Helen Edela. - The one that... This was this big. - You remember? - Oh, my God. Where-Where are they now? - In Tel Aviv. They hate it. [Laughing] [Mumbling, Sighs] I don't want to go home, Tamara. What do you want to do? Stay here among the dead? I can't face Yadwiga yet. [Rustling, Banging] [Rustling, Banging] I have a sleeping pill if you want one. If I were lying with you, then I would sleep. Come into my bed. You won't believe me... but sometimes our little David and Sarah come to me at night. They talk till morning. But when I wake up, I don't remember anything. I believe you. Tamara, I want to... I want to ask you something. Don't-Don't be mad at me. - [Sighs] - What? During all those, uh, all those years, uh... you never had a single man? Suppose I did. I'm just curious. You can be perfectly honest with me. - Then why are you shaking? - [Chuckles Nervously] I'm not shaking. Yes. There was someone. - Yeah? - In Russia. Everything happened there. So, uh, who was it? [Chuckles] A man. Not a woman. One. Several of them. Look, you told me this much. You might as well tell me everything. Three. Three? Three men? I didn't know you were alive. I assumed if you were, you'd be doing the same thing. [Breathing Heavily] Well, then you're a whore. Didn't I tell you? [Quiet Sobbing] - Herman? - What? Herman, wake up. - Herman? - Mm. There was no one. Not one man. Not three men. Not even half a man. - You're lying. - No. [Sobbing] Over there... women gave themselves to men they hardly knew. But whenever someone tried to get close to me... [Sobs] I always saw the faces of our children before me! Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, God, Herman! Oh, God! [Yadwiga] I bake special New Year challah. I make carp's head like I'm supposed to. Then he calls and says he cannot be there... he must sell... Encyclopedia Britannica. What is Encyclopedia Britannica? And now he says he must go to Indiana. What is Indiana? What is Indiana? "What is alimony," is what you should be asking. - You need a lawyer. - Yadwiga.
