Hey, Leah. Thought you might want a cookie before we leave. Thank you. Hey, check this out. I'm here in the town of Saint Drexel, Illinois where they'll be attempting to break six world records this Christmas. They believe that, with enough Christmas spirit, they can make the impossible happen. My first time working the Christmas beat, and I'm going to see six records broken. No, you won't. Jin, only 4% of world records are broken. At the bureau we adjudicate and award world records from the largest Christmas pie, to the highest-stacked candy cane tree, and I've been working the Christmas beat for seven years and I have yet to see a single successful attempt. Wait, you're kidding. I wish I was. At this point, I'd give anything to see one. Saint Drexel already broke the record once. Maybe they can do it again. Yeah, that was 35 years ago, before big corporations started sponsoring record attempts. Jin, I don't mean to dampen your enthusiasm for your new job, but my experience tells me that there's no way that the little town in Saint Drexel is beating a world record this Christmas. No matter how desperate I am to see one. Okay, now remember it is essential to the plan that we break at least one record, preferably more. Now, the media's already here, phase one complete, thanks to Mayor Hubble. Never underestimate the power of social media, folks. And I'll tell ya, the cafe was bursting with diners this morning for the first time in years. See? It's already working. Yes, yes. We're all very excited, Mom, but we need to stick to the plan. Okay, everybody knows their assignments? - Mm-hm. - Great. The world records adjudicator's name is Leah Hoffman. Winning her over is my job. Phase two. Lay on the charm, Devon. You know I will. Okay, everybody bring it in. Bring it in. Let's save Main Street by making Saint Drexel a tourist destination once again. "World record Christmas" on three. One, two, three. World record Christmas! Okay, we should hit the road. Saint Drexel is only 45 miles out, but I don't want to be late. Your rental is outside. Anything else you need? I don't think so. Good. Jin, you are being trained by the best of the best. No one knows the manual like Leah. Take notes, there's going to be a test when you get back. Will do, sir. Ah, without you, Leah, I'm not sure what I'd do. Always willing to cover the Christmas world record breaking attempts. Safe travels, call if you need me. Jin. Bye, sir. I think that's it. Anything else I should know before we leave? Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho! I come with gifts for some very hard-working adjudicators. Jin? What's it called again? Pogonophobia. The fear of beards. Well, hopefully, there's not a lot of big beards on this trip. And decantophobia. A fear of... I get a little weirded out when large groups of people... sing. And you usually faint? Out like a light. Well, how do you feel now? Good. Great, in fact. It only hurts when I move. Oh, okay. Well, maybe we should find a doctor in town before we hit Town Hall. You okay? Sorry, are you lost? You look lost. Uh, oh, no. I was just checking to see if there was a long line-up inside for a doctor. Oh, my colleague here has a bump on his head, and, well, we're kind of in a rush. Uh, may I? Hey. Let's have a look at you. Okay. Look up. Good. Look down. Okay, any headache, blurred vision? I think you're fine, but that is quite the bump. Was it her right hook or is she a south paw? Oh. Oh, no. She's, um... Um, well, actually the thing is, I saw this beard, and so, uh... Okay, are we done here? Done. Uh... Trust me, your friend here is going to be fine, but just to be safe, and I'm not sure how far you're going, you should do the driving. Uh, I gotta go. In a bit of a hurry myself. In the future, you should learn to bob and weave. Okay. Take it easy on the poor guy. Welcome to Saint Drexel, Leah Hoffman. And... Merry Christmas! Come walk with me. Hi. And this is where the kissing will commence. Mayor Hubble, the longest kiss under the mistletoe is a very popular holiday record. Hundreds of people from all over the world try to attempt it every year. I know, and this is the sign that will track the numbers of hours while they, uh... Do you know what the current record is? 46 hours and 24 minutes. That's why we chose a couple that's crazy in love. Scott MacDougall, Josie Stetson. Hi. Okay, before we begin, I have a couple rules we need to go over. The first is the Rudolph rule. Hello, hello! Hi. Hi, Josie. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, man. - Scott, good to see you. You're, uh... You're not Leah Hoffman from the World Record Bureau. And you're not a janitor. No. No, I'm not. Dr. Bancroft, let me introduce you to Ms. Hoffman and her colleague Mr. Lim. How's the head? Oh, feeling great, doc. Yeah? Little inside joke. Give me a minute. I'm going to check on the couple before they start smooching. Great, I was just about to go over some rules. Everyone knows Rudolph, right? Let's think about his experiences. Go on, I'm listening. There's a stethoscope in your ear. Uh, something about Rudolph? I took the Bureau's three most important rules and tailored them to Christmas record attempts. I renamed them the Fruitcake Rule, the Wiseman Rule, and the Rudolph Rule. Page 104, section 5.2 of the Adjudicator's Manual states, "Adjudicators must manage all participants' expectations before any record-breaking attempt begins. Hence, the Rudolph Rule. Think about Rudolph's story. Born with that weird nose, bullied by the other reindeer, and needed just the right circumstance, in his case one foggy Christmas Eve, in order to go down in history. Light George Washington. The point... My point is, record breaking isn't easy, and people often try over and over and over again before they succeed. It could take years. Well, Ms. Hoffman, this is Saint Drexel. Prepare to witness the impossible. Wonderful! You guys ready? Okay, let's start the countdown. Five. Four, three, two, one. Kiss! ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ Hey, Jin, can you hold my stopwatch for a second? Fa la la la la, la la la la - ♪ 'Tis the season... - Jin! Ooh, ooh. Excuse me. - Um... - Hey. What happened? Decant-something. Decantophobia? Yeah, that's it. - Oh. - Okay. Whoop. He's just going to need a couple seconds. I'm all good. It's all good. Keep kissing, keep singing. Come on! Come on! ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ Oh! Keep kissing! Don't worry, Jin will be fine, but thank you for officially banning spontaneous caroling for the next week. No problem. Mayor, while Jin looks over the kissing, There are a couple rules I'd like to go over. You should explain them to Dr. Bancroft. He's going to be guiding you through town this week. Dr. Bancroft? Well, I'm in charge of the social media posts. You should follow us. ♪ WorldRecordChristmas. He's cleared his entire schedule for you. Unless there's an emergency, he's all yours. You two will get along just fine. He's from the big city, too. Well, he's from here, but he went to med school at Harvard, and then practiced in Boston. Really? Yeah. Come with me. You're going to love Nell's bed and breakfast. She's got some beautiful rooms prepared for you. Hi. You must be Leah. Yes. She's all yours, Nell. Oh, thank you, Mayor Hubble. Well, come on in. After you. - Thank you. - Any time. Go ahead. Welcome, my dear. Here we are. Oh. That was great fun. The bakery wanted a winter scene painted on a cookie with icing, and of course they called on me. Wow, and you managed to break a world record. That record was broken several years after. By a commercial bakery, I believe, in Minneapolis. - Hm. - Yeah. I believe that record's been broken 20 times since 1987. Well, I wish people would remember that we were the first town to do it. With a homemade shortbread cookie recipe, and local talent, and a whole lot of Christmas spirit. Mm-hm. What did you paint on the cookie? Ice skaters at Jenkins Pond just outside of town. I used to take Devan there. Devan? - Mm-hm. - Dr. Bancroft. Yes, my son. He just lives up the road. Oh. You know, that cookie was on display for the public in the Town Hall, and folks would come to visit our town just to see it. And they would go skating together at Jenkins Pond. Oh, it was marvelous. Breaking records does draw attention to a place. Yes. My bed and breakfast used to be so full. Hey, Mom! Oh, Devan, sweetheart. I've got guests this week. You just can't barge in here unannounced. My goodness. Uh, I see you met Leah. Yes. Ms. Hoffman, I was thinking about Jin. Please, call me Leah. Leah, did you know the root cause of most phobias are events from the past? No, I did not. Any idea what Jin might have experienced? I don't know Jin that well. Uh, let me see. He majored in engineering before joining the Bureau, and he's a really nice guy. That's all I got. Okay. Well, that's a start. Mom, did you get a chance to see Scott and Josie kissing yet? Ah. They're really going for it. Well, I like to think positively. I know how much those two are in love. But how can people kiss so long? Impossible! Well, you might want to consult Leah here. She's witnessed a lot of impossible. I can't imagine what it's like watching people break world records all the time. It's, um, a lot more disappointing than it sounds. Huh. Hm. Well, I should go relieve Jin from his shift. Mayor Hubble tells me that you're going to take me to see some record breaking attempts in the morning? I'll uh... I'll come with you. Walk you through the schedule. - Bye, Mom. Love you. - Okay. I love you, too. - Thank you. - Okay. Have a good walk. And then on Tuesday we head to the mill. Frankly, it's more of a mini museum now that they've... Dr. Bancroft. Oh, please. Call me Devan. I feel the need to caution you that breaking a world record is a lot harder than people think. Only 4% of attempts are successful. Tomorrow I have to go over a couple rules with you straight from the Adjudicator's Manual. It's important that we follow all protocols on the outside chance that you do succeed. So, I'm sorry. Outside chance? Did you not feel the Christmas spirit in Town Hall earlier today? Christmas spirit is irrelevant. Now, I see. In order to be a good adjudicator, you also need to be a Scrooge. Scrooge? You do know how Dickens described him, don't you? Cold, through and through. I prefer to call it realistic through and through. And if being a Scrooge makes you understand why I'm here, then bah humbug. Thanks for walking with me. I think I can take it from here. I think you and I have a better understanding of each other now. I think we do. Goodnight. Leah. Don't forget, in the end Scrooge had a complete change of heart. You know, my mum might be right. Who could kiss for this long? It's a very popular record to attempt. Lots of people try it. Perhaps you've just never been crazy in love. Not this crazy. Mm, uh, are you ready? We should head out to the next attempt. Okay. Good luck. Okay, so how many more rules? Two. The next is the Wiseman Rule. Let me guess, something about the dangers of frankincense. Page 54, section 3.2 of the Adjudicator's Manual states, "Adjudicators must never accept a bribe in any form." I get it, people bearing gifts. One time it was literally gold. A man gave me his watch. He wanted me to overlook the fact that he was nine snowballs short of the most projectiles launched by senior citizens in a five minute snowball fight. Wow. Senior citizen. Dr. Bancroft. Leah, this is Ken Stetson. He owns the Twinkleberry Company on the east side of town. They make the most beautiful strands of Christmas lights. Hello, Leah. Need a Christmas light? Call Twinkle Bright. It's nice to meet you, Ken. I hear your daughter is one half of the mistletoe kissing couple. Yes, Josie, and if there's anything you need while you're in town, anything at all, don't hesitate to ask. Thank you, but... No, I mean it now. Anything. Yeah. I think Ken just tried to give you his watch. Told ya. Hello. Hello, hello. Good morning. This is certainly exciting, but I need to ask you all to stay on the sidewalk while I take Leah inside to meet Francine. Alright, wish us luck. WoGood luck. Oh, welcome to Hoppy's Cafe! Thank you. Wow, I see you collect Christmas cards. Oh, yes, they're not just displayed here. They're in the kitchen, the pantry, even in our walk-in refrigerator. And when did you start this collection? Oh, well, I opened the cafe 20 years ago. Someone sent me the first card as a joke, and as you can see it kind of snowballed. And do you what the current record is for most Christmas cards featuring frogs is? 1010. And you claim to have how many? Well, I had 1006, but then my sister-in-law found new ones in a shop in Albuquerque. It's a big frog town that Albuquerque. She sent me three with her best Christmas wishes. Now, I got three from my out of town friends. So, I, um, I now have 1012. You gotta count all these? Maybe, but first I need to check a couple of things. Oh, yeah. Yeah, take all the time that you need. Can I ask you to stand outside with the others? - Sure. - Great. Uh, even me? Scrooge was a solitary fella. Ah, the bah humbug rule. Mm, now that has a nice ring to it. You're catching on. Okay, come on, Francine. Oh, yeah. Okay. Alright. Let's do this. As we all wait outside Hoppy's Cafe with Saint Drexel hoping to break the world record... Oh, looks like we have an update coming. Francine, Devan, can I see you both inside? Guess we'll have to wait and see. The Bureau Adjudicator Dictionary defines "frog" as a tailless amphibian with a short, squat body, moist, smooth skin, and long legs for leaping. I'm sorry to say, but you did not break a world record. Let me explain. The problem are these six cards. I found two in the men's room, two beside the coffee table, and two hanging from the dishwasher. Uh. That's not a frog. That's a turtle. And this one isn't even a Christmas card. Yeah, and this one looks like a lizard with a Santa hat. It's easy to see that, with 20 years, other amphibians snuck into your collection without you even realizing, but because the rule requires frogs, there are six inconsistent cards that makes you two cards short of tying the record and three short of beating it. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. But I will say, this is a really impressive collection. Thanks. I guess we should go tell the others. Yeah. Oh, no. That's my job. You live here. I'll be the bearer of bad news. Rolling? Ms. Hoffman, was it close? Very. Well, there you have it. Saint Drexel's first attempt to break a holiday record is unsuccessful, but very close, and if you grew up in a small town like me, you just can't help but root for them. Xavier Samson, DRXL News, signing off. Hey. Come in. Hey. Hey, I just wanted to... You're decorating a tree by yourself? Nope, you're here. Here, give me your coat. Oh, no, no. I haven't decorated a tree in a really long time. Why not? Well, I'm never home for the holidays and I usually volunteer to work the Christmas beat. Okay, well, it sounds like you need a course in tree trimming 101. Come. Here. Okay. But just a couple of minutes. I have to relieve Jin from Town Hall. Ah, I see. Well, I must tell you, there are some decorating rules you should be aware of. Oh, what? You thought you were the only one who had rules? No, no, no, no, no. I am very, very particular about my Christmas trees. Okay. What are the rules? Um, mm, first rule, uh, the Tannenbaum Rule. I'm going to need some specifics if I'm going to fully comply. You know the song, "O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum?" "How lovely are your branches?" Exactly. You must compliment my tree while you decorate it. Wait, what? Yeah, allow me to demonstrate. Not only green when summer's here, but in the coldest time of year. Okay, now... now you try. Yeah, I don't even know the lyrics to the song. Yes, you do. Come on. Do it. ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Much pleasure dost thou bring me ♪ Okay, wow. The old English version. Aren't you posh? Yeah, I just wanted to stop by and say I'm sorry about today. Francine seems like a really nice lady. All those frogs. Yeah, well, rules are rules, right? Yup, I mean, that's my job. Doesn't mean I don't understand the town's disappointment. Mm. Disappointment. We didn't do this on a holiday whim. Saint Drexel needs this. Needs? Uh, the small business owners, especially on Main Street, are struggling to stay afloat. My mum has even considered selling the bed and breakfast. Well, Jin needs a break. I have to get back to Town Hall. When do you get a break? I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, uh, take it from a doctor. Lack of sleep and freezing temperatures are not a good combination. Bah humbug. Bah humbug. Bah humbug? How are they holding up? Not even half way. I've seen this before. They're starting to fade. I'm fairly certain Josie actually fell asleep at one point, but Steve kept his lips on hers. I hope that counts. The Adjudicating Manual defines kissing as to press or touch with the lips. Well, that's good. I really want them to do well. Jin, you can't get wrapped up with these people or this place. You have to remain impartial. It's the Fruitcake Rule. The what rule? You know, when you go to visit your grandma and she offers you a slice of fruitcake. Oh, never, ever eat the fruitcake. Yeah, terrible fruitcake. My gym socks taste better. Well, that's kind of how you want to think of adjudicating. You can never, ever help, advise, or otherwise engage in any sort of record-breaking attempt. No matter how you feel. Or who you meet. Well, I'm secretly rooting for them. Did you hear anything I just said? Go get some rest. I'll take over. Thanks. 22! Never, ever eat the fruitcake. Built in 1860, the mill provided grain for all the nearby counties, feeding families far and wide. The mill now preserves the history of Saint Drexel, and today, it just might break a world record. We've amassed quite the collection of Saint Drexel artefacts. I think it's important to understand the past in order to properly navigate the present. It's very impressive, Roger. I'm glad you appreciate it. I feel lucky to volunteer here. Tell me about these. The founder of our town was Leopold Jenkins. He was particularly fond of the holidays. These are some of his ornaments I've preserved from 1858. Leopold started the Saint Drexel tradition of trimming a town Christmas tree together. The whole community still gathers in Town Hall to do it two days before Christmas. Leah can help us this year. She's recently had lessons. That sounds like fun, but I'll be gone by then. Roger, show it to me. This way, please. Mm-hm. 'Kay. Voila! And you believe this to be a... 91-year old fruitcake. Roger, you are aware that a woman in Detroit already laid claim to this record? I am, but hers is only 89 years old. This is Leopold's personal diary. It was found in the attic recently as we retrieved the Christmas decorations. I'm still getting through it. Let me read you this entry from December 21, 1931. Sister Catherine Drexel and her young novice visited today. She brought me a fruitcake for me to enjoy, but I think I will keep it as a lasting reminder to be philanthropic and generous, just as Sister Catherine is each Christmas. - Mm. - Well, there you have it. Mr. Jenkins was quite old when he wrote this. His handwriting betrays it. Yes, quite advanced in years. Roger, I did a deep dive online last night into Saint Catherine. Fascinating woman. On December 21, 1931, before she was canonized, Catherine Drexel was celebrating Christmas in Louisiana with her students at a college that she founded. I believe Leopold wrote in 1937, but the seven looks like a one. I can easily see how that could happen. Which means the fruitcake is 85 years old, and four years short of the record. I'm sorry, guys. Josie, honey! Sadly, this is Saint Drexel's third failed attempt at breaking a holiday record, but we're still all smiling here in Town Hall, 'cause, as we've witnessed over the past couple days, smiling is the second best thing you can do with your lips. Well, good news is he still has a pulse. Scott, wake up, buddy. Are they going to be okay, doc? Perfectly. Maybe you might need some lip balm. 31 hours, 18 minutes, and 52 seconds. Alright, buddy. Let's get you up. I'm guessing that's Scott's father? Bob McDougall. He owns the Drexel bicycle factory on the west side of town. Yeah, he and Ken are best friends, but were completely taken aback when Josie and Scott started dating. That was last Christmas though. Both fathers are completely on board now. Mothers, too. We're expecting a proposal any time now. We? They. They. I meant they. Like, Saint Drexel. How do you know all this? I've been watching them kiss for over a day now. Everyone's kind of told me their story. Looks like you could use some sleep, too. Buy you dinner at the bed and breakfast and straight to bed. Doctor's orders. Okay. Okay. Let's go, let's go. Alright. So, is everyone good here? - Yes. - Oh, yeah. Thank you for everything. Oh, you're so welcome, sweetheart. Mwah. I'll clean up. Oh, that's an offer I can't refuse. - Sweet dreams, everyone. - Goodnight, Nell. - Goodnight. - Night-night. I'm getting pretty tired, too. I should probably head... Hey, uh, Jin. You know vasovagal syncope occurs when the body overreacts to certain external triggers? I should also add that fainting is extremely inconvenient as well. Yeah, well, there... There is a treatment, you know? Exposure to triggering stimuli. If you're game, I think I can help. What about the records? We'll go about our day tomorrow as planned, but we'll also get to the root of the problem. You'll see. Why not? Anyways, tomorrow could prove to be challenging, so I should probably get some sleep also. - Goodnight, Jin. - Goodnight. Do you really think you can help him? We have less than a week left. Knowing you can help someone and failing to do it is, well... I'm sorry, did I say something wrong? Uh, no. No, no, no. Tell me this, who... Who keeps a fruitcake for over 80 years? I thought it was a fossil of some sort. Yeah, we needed a... We needed an archeologist, not an adjudicator. Uh, I'm so tired I'm losing it. You have a great laugh. You promised your mom you'd help clean up. Come on. I'll help you. I did, didn't I? - Alright. - Let's go. Let's go. I do the cooking, cleaning, and vacuuming. My mom used to tell me that she isn't handing me off to my future love without some skills. She's right. Nothing sexier than a man doing housework. - Mm. - Trust me. I thought women liked investment bankers and lawyers and... Doctors? I was going to say CEOs, but, uh, how do you feel about doctors? Especially ones in small towns who take out the trash and wash the dishes. Well, I will admit, when you offered to help Jin I found it... You found it? How are you going to help Jin anyway? Um, I will show you. Jin's going to love a little beard. Are you sure you went to med school? Oh, yeah. Graduated and everything. - Oh, did you? - Mm-hm. Looks like it. Oh, yeah. Clean that beard up. Little more, yeah. Thank you. Alright, well, that was my last dish. I'm going to head outside and get some fresh air before going to bed. Company or no company? Mm... Both: Hm. Company. Okay, great. So, when you were a little girl, did you just lie in bed at night, stare up at the ceiling, and dream of becoming an adjudicator? I mean, how does that even happen? Well, it sort of just fell into my lap. I studied business in college. And when I found out about this job, I thought it might offer some fun and adventure. And does it? Truth? Please. Not often. But, since I'm usually working over Christmas, I often create a world record of my own. Really? For what? Most missed opportunities. I mean, I get to do a lot of fun things, yeah, but I miss a lot of important ones, too. You mean your family? Yeah, and friends. My parents separated when I was young, and since then, Christmas has been difficult. So, I work. Solves the problem entirely. Ah. Does it? I just want them to be happy, and the problem is, I think that they're happiest when they're with each other. Even after all these years. Have you told them that? I try. Doesn't get very far. Ah. It's just been so many years of misunderstandings. And you are the one common denominator. That's... That's gotta be hard on you. Okay, doc, let's leave the diagnosing to Jin's issues. I'm doing just fine. Okay. Alright, you know what? Come on. Where are we going? You're not going to want to miss it. Okay. Let's go. Oh. Thank you. You're welcome. Ah. What do you think? Ah. Tell me the truth. You used to bring girls here when you were a teenager, didn't you? Yeah, girls eat this stuff up. I'm just kidding. I've never stood in this gazebo with another woman ever. I just, uh... I didn't want you to miss another Christmas opportunity. Thank you. And there it is. Another missed opportunity. Gotta be a record Hold that thought. Small town. Always on call. Dr. Bancroft, this better... Hold on, I'll be right there. I gotta go. Hey. So, what happened to this ankle? Well, I thought I'd get some garland up for the Secret Santa world record. It's fine, really. I'm okay. Ow! Okay, you were going to go do this by yourself? Garland can wait 'til tomorrow. Your ankle needs an X-ray. No, it's just twisted. But I'd like to be sure. There you go. Stay here with Leah. I'm going to go get my car. It's less than a block away. Oh, yeah. This better just be a sprain. I haven't completed my assignment. Ow! Oh, ooh, ooh. Uh, um. Try not to think about the pain. Tell me about your assignment. Well, Devan gave one to each town person. For the record breaking. Mm-hm. I got Xavier Samson here using our social media. Step one of the plan complete. But now I have to post updates, and we have a ton of followers now. Oh, you're pretty savvy for a small town, huh? Well, we each know what we have to do to make this happen for Saint Drexel. Francine's got the frog cards. - Mm-hm. - Roger's got the fruitcake. Yeah. And from what I've seen so far here tonight, Doc Bancroft, he's completed his assignment. I don't understand. Well, his job was to charm the adjudicator. Ow. Got the stop watch? Right here. Good morning. Good morning, Jin. You ready? Uh, for what? Go on and have a seat on the bench. Alright. Here we go. No. Nice and slowly. Hey, you're okay. Take a deep breath. There you go. You're alright. There you go. Just keep telling yourself it's only Devan. It's o... It's on... It's only Devan. There you go. Can you stand up? Okay. Yeah. Yeah? Okay. Alright. - Okay. - There you go. Oh, okay! Whoa! You're alright! You got it. - You're awake. - Yeah! Okay, let's go and check on that hula hoop record attempt. Here we go. There you go. - You're fine. - There you go. - You're fine. - Alright, here we go. Off to City Hall. - Come on. - Don't let go of me. Don't let go of me. Don't let go of me. I won't let go. Come on. And there you have it. Most hula hoop spins in one minute by people dressed as reindeer also fails, but that was a fun one to watch. Once more? The manual states that I can allow up to 25 tries for any single record attempt. That was 26. See? I can break the rules. Hey, uh, Leah, what's wrong? Oh, nothing's wrong. I'm just, you know, doing my job, you know? Xavier Samson, DRXL News. I'd love to interview you. I'm afraid that's not possible. It's against Bureau policy, but you should talk to this gentleman here. Oh. No, no... Dr. Bancroft, the beard behind the entire operation. Oh, well, I'd love to ask you a few questions if you don't mind, from a human interest angle. Sure. And we can get you on camera? Uh, yeah. No problem. Great, thanks. So, Dr. Bancroft, you are the town doctor. Yeah, I am. How long? Five years. And what brought you to Saint Drexel? Someone I love needed a doctor. Oh, and is someone a he, a she? A she. And how are you feeling about this latest attempt not being successful? Yeah, it's... it's heartbreaking, but, uh, I'm sure we'll get the next one. Okay, best of luck. Thank you. Thanks. Hey. May I join you? If you want. Brought a little blanket. You can't fool me, you know? I know why you escaped out here. Really? Yeah, I can't listen to Jin regale my mom with the story of his beard success one more time either. He should be proud. He went the entire day without fainting. It's a great start, that's for sure. Leah. What's wrong? Are you upset with me? I'm upset with me. I... I almost forgot why I'm here. And just like you have your assignment, I have mine. My assignment? To charm the adjudicator. Well, technically, my job was to win her over, but I can see that's not going so well. Helping Jin? The gazebo? You even did dishes. That is inexcusable behavior. I understand how you must be feeling. Okay, but, what if I told you I have been completely baffled from the first second I saw you. Like, today, I was so worried what you were thinking when Xavier asked why I returned to Saint Drexel. I heard. A woman you love. Leah, it was my mom. She got sick, I was hundreds of miles away in Boston. Oh no. Yeah, I should have recognized the symptoms earlier. Every time we talked on the phone I... I sensed something wasn't right, but of course she didn't want to worry me. I spent so much time at the hospital I almost missed the signs completely. My colleagues in Boston thought I was crazy when I resigned to return home and treat her, but if I hadn't, it... Devan, I had no idea. Well, it's okay. She's... She's full of life. You see her. - Mm-hm. - Yeah. I feel like she's gotten a second chance. That's why I wanted to have and enjoy all the things she loves. Running the bed and breakfast, painting. Looking after me. That's a lot of sacrifice on your behalf. Do you ever regret it? Wow, what a question. Yeah, I'm sure a lot of people wonder, but you're the first to ask it out loud. You know, sometimes you have to give up an important job in order to live an important life. All these people in Saint Drexel, I mean, I know them, and not just their blood pressure. I know their hopes, their dreams. Their struggles. And that's why you have to break a record. To help them. Exactly. Except lately I... have lost my focus. The more and more time we spend together, I care less about breaking the records, and more about being with you. You, uh, you thought I was charming the adjudicator. No, I was trying to figure out how she completely charmed me. That stopwatch, your crazy rules. - Crazy? - Yeah. Those rules put your town back on the map. Have you seen how many people have come to visit since we started? Yeah, and it's great, but... it's only a short-term solution. Breaking the record will make sure people come back here year after year. Well, you have two more chances. To break the record or with you? To break a record. I am far more impossible. Mm-hm. So, Simone works all the kids' birthday parties in Saint Drexel. She's a clown, a magician, a princess. Multi-talented. That she is. Ah, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ah. Come with me! 307 balloon reindeer in a family van! Where'd you get these great wheels? CarMax. Bought it online and they delivered it right to my door. They made it so easy and I decorated it myself. The kids see it coming from a mile away. I'm going to need to make a phone call. Give me a minute. Mm-hm. Ah! So exciting. I must be the worst trainer ever. Have you not learned one rule? Manage your expectations. World Record Bureau. Doug. Hey, hey! Leah, how's it going in Saint Drexel? No record broken yet. - Hey, can you do me a favor? - Doug: Sure, what do you need? Can you look up the specific parameters of a van in the manual? No problemo. Anything you want cross-referenced with that? Yeah, uh, balloon reindeer. And despite her abundance of Christmas spirit, which I suppose is good because it frees them up to pull Santa's balloon sleigh on Christmas Eve. Hey, it's in the manual, Jin. The definition includes school transport vehicles, and apparently some high schoolers in Pennsylvania filled a school van with 382 balloon reindeer last year as a prank on their principal. Yup. I got it. Come on, Jin. I expect the town to be disappointed, but you? I told you, the chances of Saint Drexel beating a world record was very, very slim. You predicted all that is happening. Well, if you want to be a successful adjudicator, you have to be practical. Reign in those hopes a little. I'm not. Not what? I'm not going to be a world record adjudicator. My tendencies to faint aside, it's just not a good fit, 'cause, no offence, but I don't think I could be like you. Reigning in my hopes all the time. I like you a lot, and I know it's a part of the job, but I couldn't walk around pretending to be all detached and dispassionate. I mean, all this week all I've wanted to do is cheer the town on and help them succeed. I couldn't go from place to place just waiting for people to fail, I mean, what kind of a job is that? I want people to be successful. It's just... Rules are rules. Well, not for me. Consider this my formal resignation. Are you sure? Positive. Well, can you stay with me until the end of the Christmas beat? We'll tell Doug when we get back to Chicago. It's just... Of course. I love to hang out with you, and I wouldn't miss this last attempt for anything. I've got a good feeling about this one. Let's go. ♪ In the air it's starting to feel like Christmas ♪ Here you are! I wanted to ask what time dinner is tonight. - Oh, 6:00? - Perfect. Hey, whoa. Wanna help? Oh, no. I don't remember the last time I made cookies. I'm more of an eater than a baker. Let's get this apron on you. - Oh. - Yes. Okay. Straight ahead in that cabinet is the pantry. Find some sprinkles. - Okay. - Let's get to work. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh ♪ - Hey! - Whoo! Oh, very nice, very nice. Hm, you ladies looking to go on the road, or? Well, we could be the Christmas cookie chorus. Hm. Okay. Listen, how's it going in Town Hall? Uh, the Secret Santa gifts arrive tonight and tomorrow, then Leah can adjudicate the inevitable record, but not before I adjudicate her Christmas cookies. Uh, which ones did she make? She made that whole tray. - Mm-hm. - Hm. Oh, excuse me. Might be some tourists looking for rooms. I can't believe how many people are in town! Section 2351.67 of the Christmas Cookie Manual states that any single red sprinkle that ends up on a baker's cheek and not on the cookie... - Hm? Is a violation. Yeah. Am I wearing sprinkles? You're not just wearing sprinkles. It looks as if you bathed in them. Well, things got a little crazy around here. Your mom is so, so... Uh, nutty? I was going to say carefree. She finds the fun in everything. Yeah, well, what's your mom like? I love her, a lot. Okay, that doesn't tell me what she's like. Well, we don't bake cookies, if that's what you're asking. Not that she wouldn't, but Christmas can be difficult. If I spend time with one, I feel guilty for not spending time with the other, even though they assure me it's fine. Did you ever think that that's why you volunteer to work every Christmas? Okay, here's a thought. Maybe, maybe you work over Christmas so you don't have to celebrate it. I... I celebrate Christmas. - Do you? - Yeah. Okay, y... You don't decorate Christmas trees, you don't make cookies, with the exception of today, yes, and you miss opportunities with friends. Mm, okay. But, but this Christmas cookie you made is fantastic. There may be hope for you yet, Scrooge. You're right. I hate that you're right, but you are. Even though my job immerses me in Christmas, I spend so much time avoiding it for years. Here. Here. Major life revelations go down easier with cookies, trust me. Both: Mm. I can bake. You certainly can. - It's good. Wanna try? - Yeah? Ah. That's great. Nice shoe. Thank you. Oh, that's great. Thank you. Oh, to Doc Bancroft. I guess I just ruined the surprise, didn't I? We know who your Secret Santa is now, Devan. Thank you. Hi! Devan. Hey, I was just thinking about you. I thought maybe you could count these while we stack them, that way... I need to talk to you, outside. Uh, yeah. Okay. What a beautifully wrapped gift. How many? 2605. And you're sure? Doug just called. A charity in Amsterdam just broke the record last night. Largest game of Secret Santa. Verified. But the previous record was only... 1463. You could have done it. But not now. I'm so sorry. This... This was our last attempt. Okay, uh... I'll go in and tell them. You know what? Let them carry on for the night. It's bringing them so much joy. I'll, uh, I'll tell them tomorrow. Alright. Let's go. Maybe we should wake Jin up to go check out the Secret Santa record. I think I'll let him sleep. Jin's been through a lot this trp. Well, he seems better. Devan's been really great. He didn't have to help me, but he did. He said to me, "Knowing you can help someone but failing to do so is..." Come to think of it, he never finished that thought. He always goes the extra mile. Like to help with breaking records and helping the town. Well, actually it was my idea to have you come. I remember 35 years ago, when we broke the record, people came from all over just to see where it had happened. The bed and breakfast was always full. Especially at Christmas time. You can't sell this place, Nell. You love it! I know, I do, but you know the other day, when the doorbell rang, it wasn't guests. It was an interested buyer, and it's getting foolish to keep saying no. But if we break the record for the Secret Santa tonight, that will change everything. Let me get us some more tea, okay? Knowing you could help someone, but failing to do so is... Nell, I have an idea. Yeah? It might be a bit tricky to communicate, but hear me out. 'Kay, go ahead. Watch Leah carefully. Uh, you want to play charades in the middle of the afternoon? Whatever, you're the boss. Okay, great. Let's break into teams. No, no, no. One team. But we have to concentrate on what Leah is trying to tell us. Or, I mean, what phrase she's acting out. Okay. Okay, go for it. Two words. Okay, that's cheating. But, a record. Snap. No, no, no. Break! You're breaking something. Okay, oh, oh, you thought of a record Saint Drexel could break, but you can't tell us out loud because it violates the rules. It sounds like... sounds like, um, um... Sounds like knee. Bee? Sea? Tree, tree, tree, tree! Tree. Fireworks! Fireworks. Oh, lights on a Christmas tree. - You're... you're... - You're... you're... You're, uh, carrying a plate of Christmas cookies down the street? Wh-what is it? She's riding a bicycle! Saint Drexel should break the world record for longest time lighting a Christmas tree using human power! Oh, my! The current record is 10 hours and 15 minutes. And we have everything we need right here. The Twinkle Brite Company and the Drexel Bicycle Factory. And, not to mention an unemployed engineer in town happy to make it all happen. Leah cannot hear our plans. It breaks the rules. I didn't hear anyone say a word. Did you? Not a single one. So, this means we're in town? Another week? Boom. Right on. Oh, yes! How did everyone take it? Well, at first they were disappointed. Until I told them there would be another attempt. The place was buzzing with excitement. I plan on explaining the details tomorrow. I'm surprised they didn't wanna do another Secret Santa exchange anyway. Well, even though we didn't break the record, I kinda told them that we could deliver some of these to the hospital on Christmas Eve. Spread the holiday joy. Devan. How are you still single? How are you still single? Oh, I have plenty of faults. Believe me. Uh, me too, but, uh, I've been on my best behavior since you arrived. Oh. Is that so? Yeah. And my mom wouldn't call them "faults," by the way. She calls 'em "best-worsts." Hm. What's a "best-worst?" It's when a characteristic is the best thing in some circumstances and the worst in others. Like... like Jin. He can be impulsive, right? Uh, yep, he quit in the middle of training with no back up plan. He did. He did. But he's also impulsively helpful and impulsively generous. He doesn't need to think about it. He just jumps in. With both feet. I get it. His best-worst. So, what's yours? Hm. Uh, being irresistible. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. And in what circumstance is that worst? Uh, when a rule-following adjudicator is trying relentlessly to resist me. Oh, mm. Dance with me. Come on. Still waiting to hear your real best-worsts. Mm. Dancing. - Mm. - Here, like this, I'm fine. But take me to a wedding, and yikes. - Yikes. - Yeah. - It's bad. - Really bad? - Ooh, very bad. - Oh, no. A little to the left. No, I think to the right. Don't you think? I... That's it! That's it. Yes. Perfect. Yes. Hey, guys. Here's the plan. We're gonna take shifts pedaling the bikes. Jin has figured out how to use them to generate power for the Twinkle Brite lights in the tree. Now, we have to keep the tree lit using only human power for 10 hours and 16 minutes to break the world record. I love it. How many bikes? Uh, Jin, how many bikes? Five. And I'll bring our newest lights of the season. They shine extra bright. Okay, great. Thank you, both. Couldn't've done it without you. That way. Ah! I am so tired! At this point, I'm running on caffeine and Christmas cheer. It'll all be worth it, Mom. One more day. Thank you, Jin. Your skills are outstanding. And so needed! My pleasure. You know, I have some good friends in Chicago. And one of them owns an engineering firm. Really? Let's give her a call. See if she has any openings for a great mind like yours. Uh, that would be great. Thank you. Okay, you two go ahead. Leah's probably out on her nightly stroll. I'm gonna see if I can find her. Be sure and thank her too, because what she did for us couldn't have been easy. - I will, Mom. - Okay. All right. - Hey! - Hey. Been looking all over for you. Oh, I avoided town hall on my walk tonight. Didn't wanna see anything I shouldn't. Right, right. I'm not sure I've said thank you. No records are broken yet. Manage your expectations. Think Rudolph. It's just I know how hard this is hard for you. You don't like to stretch the rules. Frankly, I'm still wondering why you did. Can I tell you something? Sure. I have never witnessed a single successful record attempt. You're kidding. Not one. What about witnessing the impossible? Never have. Well, Saint Drexel is gonna change all that. I hope so. You know, I think Saint Drexel is changing me. How is it, one little, small town can get under your skin so easily? - Well, it's a condition. - Oh. Yeah, yeah. I've got it too. No cure. Well, please tell me there's at least a treatment. I mean, otherwise, how will I go home? Stay. At least until Christmas. There you go. You just witnessed a successful attempt to kiss you. Oh. I've been trying to do it for days. Talk about impossible. I don't have my stopwatch, but, I don't think that was nearly long enough. Mm? And in just five hours, the entire town of Saint Drexel will try to pedal its way into world record history. Take it from this reporter. You will not find a place more full of Christmas spirit than this wonderful town... Oh, Jin! Jin, I'm leaving! Jin. Nell believes the children of Saint Drexel should know that Santa came to see the town break the record. Besides, I can't even see the beard. I can just feel it. Okay, I know you resigned already, but, honestly, I must be the worst trainer of all time. Look at you in this get up! If this isn't the furthest thing from impartial... Hey, hey, hey. You're a great adjudicator. I used to be. I don't know what's gotten into me. Okay, how's this? After years of working the Christmas beat, you finally wanted to see a record succeed. No. You wanted to see Devan succeed. And Nell. And all of Saint Drexel. Hey. There should be no rules when it comes to helping people, Leah. I see The Rudolph Rule had zero effect on you. All these wild and crazy expectations. I know. Isn't it great? It really is. Come on. Give Santa a hug. Mm. Mm. And, no need to tell Santa what you want for Christmas this year. I already know. - What does that mean? - Come on. I've seen the way you and Devan look at each other. Rule follower? Yes. Subtle? Not so much. Come on. - All right. - Come on. All good to go, boss. Great! Five minutes, folks! Five minutes! Are you comfortable? It's a long time to sit and watch. I'm fine. I'm excited for you. You cannot kiss the adjudicator. It is a clear violation of The Wiseman Rule. Brazen bribery. Well, a real wise man would insist on a kiss. - Oh? - Yeah. But in these circumstances, I come bearing a secret, not a bribe. Ooh. Do tell. - Okay, Leah Hoffman... - Mm-hm. Is not a Scrooge. Uh-uh. She's smart. She's beautiful. She has a fantastic laugh. Ah? And, her Christmas cookies are to die for. But, she is no Scrooge. Three minutes! Three minutes! And no matter what happens, I will never, ever, forget what you did for Saint Drexel. Go get on a bike. First shift. And last! It's gonna be a long night. Hey. - Uh, Leah? - Leah. How could you allow this? Jin appears to be a full-fledged participant in this record breaking attempt. Well, he... He has violated so many Bureau rules. I'm forced to terminate him immediately, so we don't jeopardize this town's chances of breaking a record. - No, he... - Don't cover for him. I saw it on the news. I'm sorry, Jin. No junior adjudicator can risk the reputation of the Bureau like this... It's all my fault. No. Leave Leah out of this. Okay, I take full responsibility for all the rule breaking, and, I accept your firing. Merry Christmas, Doug. What in the world is going on? - Doug, I... - Did you break the rules too? Leah. Can you look me in the eye and tell me that you followed the rules explicitly? No. Very well. Hand me the stopwatch. We'll handle this at the office. - You are my best adjudicator. - But the town... I will adjudicate this record breaking attempt myself, so that their attempts are not deemed null and void. You know you need to get far away from Saint Drexel. A senior adjudicator cannot appear to have undue influence. It looks very bad for the Bureau. Pack your suitcase and go home immediately. We'll talk in Chicago. Five, four, three... two, one! WoCome on! You can do it! Come on! Keep going! You can do it! Hey, how are we feeling, Mr. Jenkins? Yeah, so-so? Hey. What's up? Hi. Who are you and where's Leah? I am Doug, and I sent her home to Chicago. Sorry. What? Well, you should be happy I did. This whole thing would have been jeopardized if she had stayed in Saint Drexel. She... she left? She... Well, she had to. Can't break the Bureau's rules. Hey, uh, Leah, call me. At least let me know you got to Chicago safely. Uh, hey. Devan. - I have to go. - Go? We're so close to breaking the record. - You have to see it. - I'm gonna have to miss it. I can't jeopardize the town's chances. You know I don't care about the record right now. Well, you have to. I have a feeling that tourists are gonna come from far and wide to watch you light up that tree using bicycles for many years to come. I mean, really. What is more fun than that? You did it. Your hard work paid off. You wanna know what my real best-worst is? For real? Once I decide I'm in, I am all in. No matter what. When I was in Boston, I treated people, but I overworked to the point of exhaustion. Here in Saint Drexel, I would do anything for my patients, but, in the process, I... I put my own happiness aside. Now, somehow, in the last three weeks, I became all in with you. And, for the first time in my life I felt like it was possible to be... Now, I... I... I see that you don't feel the same. No, Devan, I... How could you even leave without saying goodbye to me, or at least telling me? I had to. The rules state that if I was... Yeah, you know what? That... That is your best-worst. You are conscientious to the extreme. You are diligent and meticulous, but, you keep adjudicating your whole life like this, you are gonna miss so much. 'Cause, Leah... Sometimes the real joy is found outside the boundaries. Devan, this isn't about me. And we are five hours in and the energy here is still electric. Literally. I don't know if you can feel the excitement on your TVs at home, but in a matter of minutes Saint Drexel will have broken a holiday world record. - Yes! - WoWoo! And with tomorrow being Christmas Eve, I don't think you'll find a better example of community, cooperation, Christmas spirit, and holiday joy than in this little town. - Yeah! - Five minutes, five minutes! Five, five! We gotta get on there. - Okay. - Go, go, go! May I have a try, honey? Hey? Yeah. Atta, girl. Okay. Come on. Keep goin'. Keep goin', okay. Josie, will you marry me? Of course! Congratulations, you two. Leah? What are you doing? You are harming this whole town's chances of breaking this record. Well, I was hoping I could watch. From a distance. I just don't understand. Why are you jeopardizing your whole career like this? Well, I've never seen a successful attempt, and I want to. Not to mention, I would never have seen Scott and Josie get engaged if I was following the rules. I would have completely missed a beautiful moment. Leah, it's just another Christmas in just another town. You'll be somewhere entirely different next year. You and I both know, your job is a very important one. Wait. What did you just say? The Christmas beat. It's a very important job. You know what, Doug? Sometimes you have to leave an important job to live an important life. I quit. Wait. What? You'll have to find another person to adjudicate Christmas, because from now on, I'm gonna celebrate it. Well, yeah, but... Twenty seconds! Twenty seconds! Keep pedaling! Keep pedaling! - Keep pedaling! - We're almost there! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. The town of Saint Drexel has just successfully broken its second world record 35 years to the day after breaking its first! Thank you, racers! Congratulations. Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

But, on New Year's Eve, you're all mine. Well, I'm definitely free. I have no job, no plan, and no idea what's next. Wow. It's the best-worst place to be. And, one thing I know, I am all in.
