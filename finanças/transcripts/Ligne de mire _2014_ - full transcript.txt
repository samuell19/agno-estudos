Targeted Thursday 8:55am There they are! Tuesday - 48 hours earlier - Hello, granddad. - Hello, beautiful. - Hello, darling. - Hi, mum. Camille, didn't you forget someone? I've got to go! I'm 45 minutes late and my appointment is in 1 hour. There's a metro strike. What? A taxi will cost a fortune. Yeah, OK, you're right. Yes, you're right, I'm going. Just in front of me. There's a huge queue, I'll never make it. I think I've found a solution. I'll tell you later. Mr Horst? - That's me. - Please, go ahead. 7 Sainte-Felicité street in district 15, please, sir. Are you coming? - Come on, come here! - No, I know it by heart. Come on, stop it, please Claire. The work will start up again soon. The plumbers and masons will be back. They'll all be here. Claire. It would be very nice if you and I could smile again. I'll get this job. It's the fourth interview I've had. We'll have our house soon. - Your house. - What do you mean? It was your idea, remember? We've ended up paying a mortgage on an unfinished house. I couldn't have known that the builder would go bankrupt. I'm 35, living with my dad and being harassed by debt collectors. Claire. Mr Horst? It's all there. Who was that man? I don't know. They told me to take you here and wait for someone. - We must go to district 15. - I do what they tell me. I must be at Evast in 20 minutes. OK, stay cool. - Sainte-Felicité street, right? - Number 7. Mr Thibault? - Mr Thibault? - Sorry. What sort of salary do you expect Mr Thibault? As director of IT projects, what salary would you expect? Of course, the salary I would expect... Given my past experience in banking security systems... Any particular problems today, Mrs Breton? Just the shakes this morning. The doctor won't tell me when I can leave. I've been here a week already. How do you feel about this trial? She used to be my supervisor. There's a lot of pressure but Mr Isorni must pay for his acts. Mr Isorni forged the security commission results only to fatten up the shareholders wallets. These medications' components... There's nothing new, they keep repeating the same thing. We'll see when it's over. How many of us were poisoned by those bastards? - I hope they pay for this. - They will! The witnesses are up next. Aline will knock them out. I know her, she'll let them have it, I guaranty it. If only everyone was like her. I'll come back and see you in a few hours. Mr Thibault! Mr Thibault, you forgot this. Thanks. David, it's me. I am just checking in. I wanted to know if the interview went well. Well, call me back. I'm going for a walk with a friend. When will you be back, darling? I don't know, maybe in an hour or so. - See you later! - See you later. I think it has lost its bubbles. It doesn't matter, dad. Here, a little present! That's adorable, darling, thanks. What's the problem? The problem? For weeks, we've been squatting at my granddad's, I'm miles away from my friends and mum is unbearable because of that idiot and the house they're paying for that they'll never have. You know, you should trust your mum, she's strong. What does she see in that idiot? What she didn't see in me, I imagine. I wasn't easy. I'm a bad husband, a bad father and a bad painter. A bad painter? You'd be the best if you were more motivated! The same goes for being a father. Don't speak about yourself like that again. I don't want to see you in this state again, never again. I won't come back again otherwise. Captain, the shell. A big calibre for the daytime. And no one heard a thing. A silencer. This isn't just street payback. What's worth stealing here apart from hard drives? The video surveillance recordings from this afternoon have disappeared. - OK. Get Dormant and Dupuis to investigate the area. I want every timetable, every arrival, every departure, everything that happened here this afternoon. Look into the shop keepers, the beggars and taxis. Use a wide net, alright? It'll be a long night. Hello, captain. Camille! Camille, we've got to chat. Come down here a minute. - How is he? - Who? I know you go and see your dad every week. I would really like to help him. - How did the interview go? - Not now. I said not now! It's me. Since when do you lock yourself in? Where's the money? Not on me, I had a little setback. We know each other well. Give me the gun and you'll get your money tomorrow and 10% more, OK? What did the guy who gave you the case look like? I don't know, Claire. It happened too quickly. I don't know, did he look like a gangster? What are they supposed to look like? 200 000 euros. Who is that Mr Horst? I don't know. What sort of person would be given money like that? It must be the mafia. Or it could be a bribe, or a ransom! Leave it off. David, what if it's drug money? David! What are you doing down here? You can't walk in circles all night. Come on in. Why don't we go on holiday? Cuba, I've always dreamed of going there. We could get a room in a 5 star hotel. We'd make love on silk sheets and have a bottle of champagne near the bed, like in the movies. Right then, you've got 200 000 euros to use, what will you do? Claire, remember that this money isn't ours. So why not dream on, then! Right, without thinking, you have all this money. What would you do? I would pay the mortgage and finish the house. You really went for it... What? In any case, this money must belong to someone. It's possible that this person is looking for us right now. There's no way they'll find you. Nothing links you to that guy. - No one would ever know. - But I would! No, no... Tomorrow, I'll go to job seekers, then to the police. That's the best solution, trust me. - But what if... - That's the only solution. OK, maybe you're right. It's the best solution. Yes. Right, let's go in, it's cold. In any case, with your new job we'll manage without the money. - Yes. Wednesday - 24 hours earlier. The day will remain pleasant. The sky will be cloudy and wet this morning in Brittany, Pays de la Loire and Normandy, with a strong wind of 80 to 100 km an hour over the coast. Later on this weather will head towards Poitou-Charentes, Limousin and Centre-Loire valley. In the afternoon, this weather will head up north to chase away the bright patches. From the northeast to the Alps it will be cloudy with bright patches. The wind will bring clouds... Please forgive me for yesterday. I was stressed out about the interview. Camille, I'm not your father, I'm not trying to be. I don't want to take anyone's place. But soon I will be your little brother's father. That's no small matter. Maybe that's worth burying the hatchet. - Have you got class today? - No. I would rather you stay at home and not outside. Why? Please. Recent destinations 1 out of every 500 users of these particular drugs will experience serious side effects such as hypertension which causes heart failure. The scandal arose just as this pharmaceutical giant was introduced to the stock exchange. The markets... Oh darling! You scared me. Are you OK? What are you looking at? You of course. Well, both of you. You and my half-brother. He will be whole. He'll have arms, legs, everything. You're half brother will be a brother. But I'm 15, couldn't you have made him earlier? You don't make a child just like that. They're made out of love with the right person. What about 15 years ago? Your father and I were crazy in love. All we were waiting for and all that we wanted was you. Now, about your little brother, I waited a bit so you'd be able to look after him. Baby-sitters are so expensive. Dream on! I'll get it. Hello. I'm Mr Lopez, the bailiff. Are your parents in? Mum! Mr Lopez. Leave us alone, Camille, please. Please. As you were informed by letter last week... Yes, I know, I know. You shouldn't take it out on us. Go after that builder. He files for bankruptcy and now we're screwed. I'm sorry, Mrs, but... Yes, you're doing your job. Hurry up, let's get it over with. This is my father's place. All we have left is in the bedroom. Good. Right, a sofa, a flat screen. We don't touch computing goods. Would you be so kind as to open the wardrobe? There's only personal belongings in there. Open it up, please. What's that? Family photos. Is the wardrobe yours? No, it's my father's. So then, we'll empty it and take what's inside, except the laundry. Hello, David? It's me. Call me back, please. It's urgent. They took everything and it still wasn't enough. Call me back or come home soon, please. I don't know what to do anymore. Captain! We have the ballistic results. - So, what news? - So... It was a model like this that killed the attendant. It's a rare German handgun, a 9mm luger parabellum probably equipped with a silencer. Isn't that an antique? They were used in both world wars. Now it's a collector's item but let's not get confused. They still work perfectly well and there's nothing more discreet. With the bullets from the body, we've got his prints. We need to find out whether this gun has showed up before. Any interesting updates? Not really. We've just got the prints of the other attendants. I would be surprised if our guy left his prints. - Or our woman. - Yeah, maybe. In all fairness, if there's one place where we're behind you, it's in criminality. What did you find in the vicinity? - Nothing. - Nothing... They didn't save the surveillance disks? OK. The man or woman who stole them was looking for someone. There's another body in the north district. You see, never despair. Let's go! It's the same calibre, the same execution, cold, almost professional. He doesn't pick up the shells. What's the point? He knows that the bullet found in the body will lead us to the gun. He doesn't waste time with useless details. It's like he was in a hurry. There's no sign of the taxi. It has vanished. He's in a hurry and very brazen. Employment office Hello, David. It's me. Call me back, please. It's urgent. And it still wasn't enough. Call me back or come home quickly, please. I don't know what to do anymore. Asshole! We can't go on like this. I can't in any case. Listen, money dropping out of the sky like that, it's a sign. A sign of what? We can't keep that money, it's not ours. - It belongs to no one. - Of course it does! I don't want to know who it belongs to. You're scared, aren't you? Talk to me David, are you scared? Yes, I'm scared, so? Claire, I'm not a... I'm just a simple guy. I'm not ashamed to be scared of the mafia turning up! I too am a simple person. I want a simple life, I deserve a life. My love... Trust me, we'll get through this. For Christ sake, stop saying that. We'll get through this, trust me. Look around you, David! No, we won't get through this, most people aren't either. You can hear that every day on the radio and on the TV. We don't have a house, we don't have any furniture, so stop with your trust crap! We've talked about this. I'm not talking anymore. I'm expecting a child, a baby who will arrive in 2 months, David! It's not possible. Not possible? If you were so sure about it, why didn't you take that bag to the police as soon as you'd got it? Why did you bring it back to this house? It's great to be up shit creak. It doesn't seem to bother you. Go, go take the bag to the police! That's it. That's exactly what I'm going to do. The North Station? That was exactly Yacine's sector. That was his area, that's where he was between rides. Do you have any clues? My drivers are starting to get scared. Between drivers, news travels quickly. Could I have Yacine's list of rides from yesterday? Only for those who booked over the phone. The drivers pick up fares without going through the call centre. I've got news about our killer's gun. It was used in Belgium two years ago. - What type of affair? - Never solved. The gun was used to kill a drug lord, they found 2 bullets in his head. Yes, hello. You surely tried to get me already but I've had a little technical problem. Don't worry, the contract will be executed in time. Wednesday, 18 hours earlier. Hello Sir, I'm a police man. You can't stay here. Yes, of course. Yes, hello? - Mr Thibault? - Speaking. I'm Mr Darland's secretary, the director of human resources for Evast. Please, go on. I wanted to inform you that we have gone with someone else. We are very sorry. Have a nice day, Mr Thibault. You too. Sorry Sir. Hello, Doctor. I'll let you go. What are you doing here? - Heads or tails? - What game is this? Come on! Heads or tails? - Heads. - Heads? OK, let's do it. - Go get your things. - Go get my things? I can't leave just like that! Plus I've got work to do. Who gives a shit about your job! Come on, let's go. Where are we going? Is anyone home? Mr David Thibault's repossession. You gave me this idea. - Me? - Well, yes. You told me that the money was a sign, remember? Yes, I remember. I remember the face you pulled. You were talking about luck. I thought we should just toss for it and see what happens. What if it had been tails? I would have taken the bag to the cops. You're totally crazy. I don't know. I only know that I'm sick of being trampled on. That's enough now. I didn't get the job at Evast. They said no. What a bunch of bastards! Yeah. Well who gives a shit now, right? Who cares, right? - Yes. - There you go. I wonder what we would have become without the money. It scares me. No, my love, that fear is over for us. It's over. Have you go it? I've not got the Kalashnikov. I'd need more time for that. How much time? Maybe midnight and it's 3,000 more, non-negotiable. OK. I don't have the choice anyway. Thanks, you're helping me out. You have no choice, see you later. Total bastard. You can see, it's spotless. Thank you. - Take care of yourself. - You too. Hugs to the kids. It's been a while since they've seen you. The North Station, Republic, North Station. The taxi took 2 hours to do the round trip. And another thing, our man's gun has been used once in Belgium. The time the train left the station, another arrived from Brussels. There's something in that. The ride booked for this Mr Horst was made by a mobile phone. We need that number. Can I talk now? The taxi driver's car has been found. - It was in the 15th district. - Why didn't you say so? No, I didn't notice anything particular. Lots of people come and go, there are other companies in the building. Let's check it all out. Follow me. What are you looking for? Come on, show me your face. Turn around. Shit! I didn't say anything to not get into trouble with my boss. It's the 1st time this has happened. What was in the file? Nothing special. The names of visitors, hours they came and went, people who drop off their CV. Could you redo the list that disappeared? The visitors that came surely had appointments. The personnel must have this information. There's 400 here. I only need the visitors from North Station. - It'll take a while. - We have little time. Can I count on you? I'm cold! The water is freezing! I love that. It feels good. No, no! I know what you're going to do, stop it! Holy cow! When I was a kid, summer or winter, I got into the water. Dear god! My god! We'll do this together him and I. It's true that between men it's better, but his little sister can come. - Little sister? - Yes. That's new. I'm telling you we're going to make lots of kids. I'm sure Camille will love looking after them. Oh yes. - I'm not sure. - Yes! I always lived alone with my mum in a 2 room flat. I've always envied those big family tables with kids everywhere. When they're screaming and shouting, I love that. It's so nice. Our little Joseph will have lots of siblings. - Joseph? - What? What about Maurice? Maurice is good. - Gontran? - No, Hector. Barnaby! Gedeon! There's no worse name. You're through to David Thibault. Leave a message and I'll call you back, thanks. He kills in a professional way, but he seems not to care that we are able to follow him. He steals the taxi and leaves clues behind him... He has a precise goal and objective. - What are you saying? - Imagine. The guy arrives and wants to get into his taxi but someone else takes it. Instead of Republic, this opportunist goes to Evast in district 15. - And now he's looking for this guy. - Exactly. He identifies the driver from the videos, finds him and kills him. Then, thanks to his GPS, he's led to Evast and steals the register. Now he has the details of the mystery guy. He's well ahead of us. We've identified the mobile phone that booked the taxi for Republic. Mathias Lampin, a business lawyer. His office is in Paris, we've just left him a message. What can I do for you, Captain? I won't lie, your colleagues call intrigued me. I would like to know about a taxi you booked for yesterday from North Station to Republic and back. Yes, I did book a taxi yesterday for Lukas Horst. He's a business lawyer from Lille whom I work with regularly. He had to personally hand over to me an important document here in Republic square. What time did he get the train back, Mr...? Horst. H-o-r-s-t. Lukas, with a k, written in the Nordic way. Around 4pm, I think. The return journey lasted 2 hours. Did something particular happen? No. We talked a lot about certain parts of the document. Horst preferred to make the taxi wait rather than book another one. There was quite a lot of traffic yesterday because of the strike. But why are you so interested in this taxi? Is there a problem? It's a routine investigation into the taxi firm. Routine, at this hour? Could I have Mr Horst's contact details? Yes, of course. I must have his card somewhere. Baptiste, find out everything you can on that Horst, a lawyer in Lille. In my opinion, that guy never put a foot in that taxi. He's covering up something. Hold on. I'll call you back. - Is that tomorrow's edition? - Yes. - Can I have one? - It doesn't work like that. How about like this? Thanks. When la Briskan tumbles Mathias Lampin and Charles Isorni are la Briskan's bosses! But wait. Lampin took care of Isorni's divorce 5 years ago. "The trial starts in Valenciennes tomorrow and Isorni will be there." Mathias Lampin who has already worked with Charles Isorni and books a taxi at the same time the train arrives from Brussels, where the gun from these two crimes was already used. That's a lot of coincidences. David Thibault? Thibault? Is that you, bastard? Don't move, Thibault. Don't move, I'm coming. What is this? It was in mum and David's room hidden under the bed. This was inside. A guy called, he's threatening to kill us. There was a photo message sent yesterday as well. That's the courthouse in Valenciennes. What is written there? "Thursday, 9am, room 714." And there's an address as well. What's going on here? I couldn't get hold of your mum or David all day. I don't want this day to end. - I think... - I think... - No, go ahead. - Go ahead, tell me. I really loved this. Oh yes. And you... It's been ages since I've seen you like this. But it's not for us. That's what I was going to say. We don't need that money, we don't need this type of life. We'll give it back tomorrow. I'll go with you. OK. No one will know we took some. We'll say you were given it like that, with exactly that amount. I could surprise you even without a case full of money. It's not the money that makes the man. I will get a job, I've got some contacts. Eh! David, we'll get through this, OK? You've got to trust me. Trust you? It wasn't me who said it this time. Is this a treasure hunt? I've been going in circles for an hour. Didn't you like the tour? They'll destroy this place in 15 days. Do you have my parcel? Yamid! Isn't it beautiful? It's perfect. Give me my money now then. No problem. I've got the little extra too. Thursday - 6 hours earlier Do you know what I'd like? A little cuddle. That was an accident. Yes, Garnier. They called me just now for a gang revenge incident. You won't believe me, but the gun that was used is surely our 9mm Luger. This time though, someone survived. I'm coming. For the 3rd and final time, who did this to you? For the 3rd and final time, go get fucked. You look well for someone who was just shot in the stomach. Screw you, you old whore! Calm down! Get me a coffee, please. - Are you sure? - Black, no sugar. Get one for yourself as well, take your time. You know, the whore would love not to speak with a fucker like you. She's got no choice, though. It's part of her job. So, as neither you nor I want this to go on too long, you're going to answer quickly, OK? Who shot you? Who? The Belgian... - What did you say? - The Belgian... Get off! The Belgian, fuck! Get off me. A hitman. He's no more Belgian than you or me. He was in prison 10 years ago for drug offences. That and Isorni means Aline Delmas is the target. Except now, there's also another target, the guy who took his taxi in North Station. He's actively looking for him for reasons we don't know. He's going to kill him. Wake up the prosecutor, I'll call Quint in Valenciennes. Hello? Hello? Captain Norman on the line. Sorry to wake you at this hour. I need you for an intervention in Valenciennes. Fabrice Marchand, OK. The 4th? David Thibault. According to the receptionist, they were at Evast on Tuesday. One of them took the taxi that was not for them. The killer is after this man and he wants to kill Aline Delmas too. We'll take care of it. OK. Let's get going straight away. We must hand it in. You've kept it for 2 days, cops... I'd rather deal with the police than end up in front of that guy! No way! What's wrong? That's the Valenciennes' courthouse. The date, Thursday at 9am, is Isorni and la Briskan's trial. - It's a little later. - What? Aline Delmas is a witness. She could put Isorni in prison! Do you think it's a contract killer? No, no! Your mobile phones. Your phones! And the one on the table too. Put them there. - And yours? - She doesn't have one. Is that true? Go and sit down. Sit down! Come here. You need a pain killer! I don't have anything here, I should go to the hospital. I imagine you understand what's going to happen at 9am. In this state, I won't be able to complete the job. So you're going to go to Valenciennes instead of me and take care of Aline Delmas. You're crazy! My car is outside. Inside, there's a bag. In that bag is a gun. You have 30 seconds to get going. We'll stay in touch via telephone. Please. You're wasting time. But I've never held a gun in my life. 15 seconds. I know how to! I went hunting with my dad when I was a child. I'm going to do it. Let me examine my father, please, just for a minute. One minute. I'll be fine. Thursday - 2 hours earlier. We'll be at Aline Delmas's in 10 minutes. Hey, nurse. I can hear you, yes. You talked about pain killers. I need a strong one that won't knock me out. - Coliban. It's on prescription only. Hello? Hey! Go to the pharmacy and get me some Coliban. If you fuck up or try to call the cops... Without a prescription, I can't. You've got 15 minutes, not one minute more. I must take him to hospital, we can't leave him like that. You're right. We can't leave him like that. Captain. Her and her husband are aware of the situation. - How are they taking it? - How would you? Be discreet around the kid. Of course. My colleague is at the courthouse. Shit, shit, shit! What? It's your shit car! The tyre has blown! No! There's nothing to change it with! Don't touch her or I swear... We understand each other. You dad hasn't got much time left. He's not my dad. What will you do if he takes more than 15 minutes? Will you kill me? You wouldn't have anymore hostages. Where are you going? To my granddad. Just shoot me if you don't like it. Why don't you just leave with your stupid money? There's a job to be done. Why do you give a shit about Aline Delmas? Me? I don't. But if she doesn't die at 9am this morning, I will be the next target, if you get what I mean. Your dad should never have taken that taxi. Mr Thibault? We're with the police. We have a few questions about your trip to Paris on Tuesday. - Yes... - Is something wrong? My daughter has been ill all night, I haven't slept. What do you want to know about Paris? Did you go to the company called Evast? That's right, I had an interview there. And how did you get there? By metro. I was late because of the strike. In fact they haven't called me back. That's not good. OK, thanks. What's going on with the company? This is just routine, sorry to bother you. Please. No one's stopping! Work it out, are you listening? Please! Are you crazy? Can you take me to Valenciennes? - Please. - Don't chat, just take the car. Get in. It's fine, she'll take me. Stop screaming, I can hear you! I've got to get into town and on the radio they say the centre is total chaos. It doesn't matter. Drop me off where you can, that's fine. You can have a cup of tea another time! This has gone too far. Threats, intimidation, OK, fair enough, but nothing is worth risking your life. It's too late now, too many lives are at stake. The media is already talking about the threat. Journalists are really on it. How did this leak so quickly? I'm ready. Make me a coffee. A strong one. - National police, hello. - Quickly... Your call will be answered shortly, please hold the line. How much did you take? Of the money, how much did you take? Is it Charles Isorni or la Briskan who's paying you to kill Mrs Delmas? Shut up. Bring the coffee. Hello? What if my wife misses her target from the hotel? She's pregnant. She hasn't held a gun in years. Come here. I said come here. We can't leave the body like that either. Come here. When I say shut up, you shut up. - Understand? - OK. Thursday - 1 hour earlier. - Is there anything on AFP yet? - No. What the hell is going on? You must move on. Can you tell us what's going on? There's a problem on Colade street. A woman is insisting on getting past. OK, I'm coming. Let me through. It'll take 2 minutes. It's just there, please. What's going on, nurse? What's going on here? My belongings are in that hotel, I just want to get them, but they won't let me through. You're not allowed, wait till 9:15. I've just come out of hospital, my car broke down, I'm exhausted and I'm close to the end. - Please. - OK, that's fine, go ahead. Thanks. Someone will accompany you. I'll be fine, thanks. I'll manage. Thanks. Yes. Understood. Captain. 2 minutes. District 17 received an odd call from a mobile phone. Snippets of a conversation about Aline Delmas were heard. They're trying to trace the number. We have less than one hour. Are you there? What's going on? What the hell are you playing at? This area is blocked off. - Where are you? - Almost at the hotel. You've got 5 minutes to get into the room. - Hello, Madame. - Room 714, in the name of Horst. Sorry, but no one turned up yesterday. What? I'll take it for today then. It has already been booked, the hotel is busy. I don't care. I need a room on the 7th floor. We have identical rooms on the 1st and 3rd floor. Are you OK? Shall I call a doctor? No, I'm fine. I'm telling you I'm fine. Take a room on the 1st floor. Then head up to the 7th floor. There's not much time left. Thursday - 30 minutes earlier. The call came from a kid's phone, Camille Fauconier, she lives near Bethune. Her address matches with one on the Evast list. - You sent a team there. - Nothing unusual. The guy must have lied. I immediately send men there. I'll head there. Tell all this to my partner. Sir! Don't close the door! I've made it. Right, now we'll put the gun together. They've listened to the recording. Apparently, that's where the killer will be. It's not very clear, the sound was rotten. There's also a story about a pregnant woman. Oh, shit! First put the barrel together. OK. Now the scope. I can't do it. Your daughter says you must manage. Yes, she was in pain, so I sat her there. Where is she? She booked room 114 on the 1st floor. But she really wanted to be on the 7th floor. Open it's the police! I've got her in my sight. Right, now, calm yourself down. Control your breathing. Take a deep breathe. Open up, police! Open this door! - Shit! - What's wrong? Shoot! - Now! - Run away! Go ahead, shoot! Go ahead! Shoot! It's OK, it's over. Yes. Here too, yes, OK. Your husband and daughter are well and fine. What about my dad? You were unbelievable, Camille. No. No, you were. You were the one who jumped on him. I admit I didn't think about it. - You were in danger, I acted. - Like a dad. Yeah. Yes. What will happen to them? They didn't kill anyone. Whatever happens, after the hell those three have been through, nothing will ever split them up. Subtitles: Eclair Group
