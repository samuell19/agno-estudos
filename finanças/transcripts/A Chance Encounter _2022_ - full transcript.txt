Hal-- Hal Flynn. Just wow. Stop saying wow. Wait, you're not one of those cruise ship people, are you? -I'm sorry? -How'd you get here? Planes, trains and automobiles, in that order, actually. You know, you missed tourist season. It, like, just ended. No. I'm not a tourist. You're definitely not a local. Well, I'm not here to do touristy things. Then what are you here for? Hmm. Hate to interrupt your playing, but would you do me a courtesy and take my photo, just like this? Courtesy? Why, yes, sir. Oh. Beautiful. Who is she? There you go. Well, let me do you one better. This was definitely not shot on an iPhone, and I happen to know a cute, little Mom and Pop shop down the road that still develops. Can I? Uh, yeah, sure. But if you can still get one on the phone too, if you don't mind? Yeah. Of course. -I think she stood there. -Okay. Okay. So I take it you've been here before, uh, Taormina? Once or twice. Well, I've been in Sicily for a couple of hours and I haven't eaten which is a cardinal sin if I am not mistaken. Uh, any recommendations? -You wanna know a secret? -Of course. Wander into any one of these places and you will have the best pasta and wine you've had in you're entire life. Hmm. And there we go. Think I got a few good ones. -Great. -Your stuff. Thanks. Um... thank you for the... the photo and the song. I'm... -I'm a fan. -Of course. Uh... Hey, Hal? This place is pretty dead. Yeah, people don't go out till late here. Restaurants don't even open until 7:00. Ugh, I'd wither away. Where are you staying? Uh, Hotel Victoria. Mm, Oscar Wilde. Precisely, how'd you know? Oh, they put signs around for the tourists. Mm. This is seriously amazing. Oh! -So you're a writer? -Uh... That's a pretty big leap. You're not here for touristy things, you're staying at the Hotel Victoria, -you carry around this notebook. -Okay, okay. Sure. Not a writer, but more, um, aspiring. So you're modest. No, realistic. I enjoy it, but there are just so many out there that-- Mm. This is seriously life-changing. It's-- it's-- -What you got? -I think it was a Tagliatelle. No, I mean your notebook. Read me something. What, now? No, in 15 minutes. I'll set a timer. Yes, now. No way, you're a famous musician. Oh, my gosh. I am not a famous musician. I have one semi well-known song, and nothing since. And nobody even knows who I am except for you, apparently. Okay. People know who you are. Hal, I'm getting impatient. Okay, fine. I have this... this poem of the day. It's stupid short stuff, but-- Sounds perfect. Normally, I wouldn't share these with anyone. Well, normally, you wouldn't be in Taormina. Okay. But you have to promise me something. Okay. You can't do that thing where you pretend to like it even if you don't, okay? I'll know. Why are you not talking? It's just making me even more nervous. Hal, you're stalling. Oh, gosh, okay. Um... "I waltz through this wave of strangers. Their conversations, they topple over each other and it sounds somewhat like, well, like rain. For now, I'm lost and well, that's okay. See, I'm happiest when I'm lost because I learn to be happy with myself. I'm reminded of a thought though, of the time my parents were children too. On the topic of children, there they are over there, a few playing soccer on the piazza, two restaurant chairs as their goal and that's enough for now. The town is big while they're small, it will grow small as they grow taller. And, hey, it really does. You're right. The sun shines differently here effervescent bright." -Hal, I need you to look at me. -Nope. Right this instant. -You're good. -You promise you wouldn't-- You're good. -You're just being nice. -No. But I am a little buzzed. And that jet lag is not gonna cure itself. You should get some sleep. Of course. Right. Do you want me to walk you? Yeah, I'd like that. Could I have your coaster? Sure. Grazie. Oscar Wilde arrived in Taormina in 1898. Well, there you have it. Uh, I'll get these photos to you tomorrow? Who needs the time, thank you. Should we meet at the fountain at four? Uh, yeah, I think I should be awake by then. Okay. Here. Hmm. All right. Think I have a little something here. There you go. "To now, the memory of tomorrow." Hey, so, should we exchange numbers or something? Just in case, you know, anything comes up or-- Let's do this the old fashioned way, Mr. Oscar Wilde. We have a time and a place and I'll be there. -Buona sera. -Buona sera. -Anche tu. -Gesundheit. Hey, you better show up. Oh, I'll show up. ♪ To now ♪ ♪ To now ♪ ♪ It's the memory ♪ ♪ Of tomorrow ♪ You're early. You're early. Well, I wanted to get here before you got here. Me, too, I guess. Okay. So, don't be mad, but the photos aren't quite ready yet. -Oh, that's fine. -But they said they can get them done in like, two or three days. When do you leave again? Uh, I'm here for a week. Quick question. What are these, like extra, extra small or-- That's how they do it here. It's an Americano. This is as big as it comes. Quality over quantity. Yeah. Okay. Let's go. I wanna show you something. Is it the Greek theater? I wanna see it so bad. I though you said you weren't a tourist, Hal. -What do you mean? -Okay. Well, yeah, we could go wait in line and we can listen to tour guides ramble on and on, but I really wanted to show you one of the best views in Taormina. -Okay, fine. -Okay. Let's go. Hey, uh, quick question. Are you taking me to Narnia or what? Okay. It is right up here. You told me it is the best view of Taormina and I'm training for a triathlon, Josie. Oh, you are fine. This is-- this is just incredible. Told you. Hey, what's that? It's a little turn of phrase. -Poem of the day? -Maybe. Okay, well, share. -No, no way you're putting me through that again. -Come on. Well-- I just started. All right? Maybe a little bit later. -Okay, I'll hold you to that. -Yeah. If you won't share, I will. -Really? -Mm-hmm. I cooked up this little melody last night. Might sound familiar. Okay. I much prefer to be on this side of things, by the way. Shut up. -Uh, there's no chorus. -Okay. No chorus yet. Just the verse. ♪ To now ♪ ♪ To now ♪ ♪ It's the memory of tomorrow ♪ ♪ The memory of tomorrow ♪ -Why'd you stop? -I don't know, hearing it again, it's no good. Are you kidding me? No, it's no good.

But if you're free tomorrow, I do happen to know a cool spot. And I still have to get you those photos. Let's see, tomorrow, I'm doing a lot of wandering around, um, just staring off into the distance aimlessly. Yeah. I think tomorrow could work. Should we finally exchange info? Um, no. Old-fashioned. Then we need a time and place. Let's do... noon at my hotel. You better show up. Well, yeah, I'll show up. -Buona sera. -Anche tu. -Very good. -Thank you. Oh, hey, I finished it, by the way. The poem, it's called "Luca." You want to... "From here, I saw hundreds of honey-gold street lamps. They were tripled along the stones, hundreds, but I only thought of one. A trail of blue fogged by the smoke of Signore Lucas Monticarlo. He smirked as two young lovers shared their first kiss. A first, he knew, for both said 'Whew' right after. He lowered his eyes to his wing tip olive-green shoes, and blinked. That blink was a minute and that minute turned two. Tomorrow turned yesterday and time already flew. The boy was him and this day when they first met, he recalled how he missed her and she wasn't even gone yet." Such a cool guy, huh? If you say so. Come on, keep up. Come-- Oh, yeah. Where the hell did you come from? So this is one of my favorite spots to write, in all of Taormina. Anyone can come here, free of charge, and just enjoy the scenery and ruins. And there is the amphitheater, it's right up there. Oh, my goodness. This is crazy. I mean, I never read anything about this place. Sounds like you need a good tour guide. Well, it looks like I found one. Mm-mm-mm. Another ten out of ten on the cuisine. I mean, do they have bad food around here? If there is, I haven't found it. Oh, my gosh. And the architecture. I mean, you have this-- this ancient Roman sculpture right next to a building with all these new additions. -I mean, it's nuts. -Greek. -I'm sorry? -Well, it was Greek for five centuries before the Romans came over. So you know a lot about this stuff. -I've overheard a lot of tour guides. -Well... I mean, you go to a place like Boston and they're just so reverent with the history. But here, it's sort of like they can pay respects without being too precious. I never thought about it like that. It's just like you said. Perfect blend of old and new. Ah. All right. Oh, before I forget. Oh, my gosh. All right. Inspection time. Wow. You weren't lying. These do beat the hell out of a... out of a phone picture. -I told you. -Thank you. You're welcome. So, Hal, I've been thinking. Uh-oh. -We both are here to write. -Well, I don't know if that's exactly-- And I find you interesting. So I was thinking that... You know what? It'd be easier if I just showed you. Come on. Let's go. What-- What? There's so much good food left. There's plenty more where that came from. All right. What's with the coaster thing? By themselves, just flimsy cardboard, but a little chicken scratch, they become mementos. You know it's weird, right? It's normal, right? -This is where you're staying? -Yep. Oh, my God! I am sorry. I did not know you were roughing it like this. -You're hilarious. -No, I mean, I seriously would have offered any assistance. I mean, are you okay? Do you need me to call someone? -I'm laughing on the inside. -Oh, here's actually-- here are those euros I offered you before. Just take them all. I mean, you need them more than I do. You know? I-- Wow. Uh... I'm speechless. How much does a place like this go for? Sorry, inappropriate question. None of my business. No, honestly, I have no idea. My boyfriend's parents bought it a few years back. Oh. I guess I forgot to mention that. That's a pretty big thing to forget. Look, I think you should stay here for the rest of your trip. Wait. What? Okay, back it up. I know it's not exactly in Taormina, but there's so much cool stuff here. The real non-touristy kind of stuff. And plus, you could save money on your hotel. There's so many things wrong with this idea. -I don't see any problem. -Okay. Uh, let's see. Uh, What about the boyfriend I just found out about? -What about him? -I don't think he'd like the idea of a strange man with you in his parents' villa. He doesn't have to know. I need to process this. Look, Hal, I don't even know what's going on. We were supposed to go to Switzerland together, and then we got in this big fight, and he left and we had a falling out. He left you quite the bail here. There's so much space here to spread out and write, we might not even see each other. I don't know. It doesn't seem-- Can it just be what it is? Depends on exactly what it is. A writers retreat. A perfectly innocent writers retreat. Two friends hanging out, looking for inspiration and writing. Sounds more like you are convincing yourself here. I like spending time with you. Do you like spending time with me? -Yes. -Then it's settled. Writers retreat. -You're very bossy. -Thank you. Why do I feel like we're gonna regret this? Ah. Grazie, Signori. -Beautiful. -Arrivederci, signor Flynn. Grazie. Comfortable? Uh, are you kidding? I, I feel like a king. Good. Um, I'll have to show you how to make the coffee. Here, they do it differently. Moka pot. But other than that, make yourself at home. Okay. Um, well, this is nuts. -Uh, but thank you. -Of course. Wait till you see the view we have for sunset. -It gets better than this? -Yes. Okay. Oh, wow! Well? Uh... unbridled awe doesn't seem to do justice. But it is the best I've got. I told you. I mean, come on, it's not real. I mean... I expect a really good "Poem of the day" out of this. Consider it done. So when's the last time you talked? You and your-- Capture it quick before it disappears. Come on. Chop, chop. ♪ A young, single guy comes to Sicily ♪ Who said I was single? ♪ Black and white photo in hand ♪ You know, it's really hard for me to write with all this musical-- ♪ A beautiful, mysterious woman ♪ ♪ Is painted against the lamp ♪ Wow, you are nosy. Nosy Josie, that's what they call me. All right, well, Nosy Josie, I think it looks like we both have things we'd prefer not to talk about. To magical sunsets! Thank you for sharing it with me. Cheers. Hal? Hal? Hal! Hal! -Hal! -Oh, jeez. - Oh. - Oh, my God! Oh, I am so sorry. Oh, my God. I think you just gave me a heart attack. Um, okay. How about a little tutorial? Okay, so don't tamp the grounds. Let them settle. Okay. Got it. Couldn't sleep? Literally the most comfortable bed ever and I couldn't stay still. My mind was just racing. -Uh, anyway, so just screw this on here? -Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Okay Yeah, I know the feeling. Plus, I never heard your sunset poem. So it didn't feel quite right to go to sleep. Uh-huh. Sure. There we go. Okay. Good. Now you're gonna let the water gurgle. It's gonna push-- steam's gonna push the water through the grounds to the top. And voila! -Science. -Mm-hmm. The last time we spoke was right before he left. No calls or texts since. Nothing. Are you okay? I mean-- It's a two-way street. I haven't exactly reached out either. What did you guys fight about? Uh, well, he brought up marriage, which to his credit, we've been together for a years and that's something couples should talk about, but... But? But every time he brings it up, I get so uncomfortable and squirmy, and then he gets mad and here we are. To cap it off, his last gesture before he left. He slipped this on the counter and went to Switzerland. Oh, wow. Yeah. -Do you love him? -Of course I love him. Okay, then why did you get uncomfortable? If I knew the answer to that, I... -I don't think that-- -Sorry, sorry, sorry. No, it's fine. It's none of my business. There's something about 2:00 a.m. that makes the hard conversations easier. What about you? -Uh-- -You know, sometimes, it's good to get everything off your chest. Uh, I put it on paper. -But if no one ever reads it? -Stop... ...making sense. Okay? Okay. Here we go. How did we do? -Okay. -Okay? -You know... -Beautiful. This makes about a quarter of the portion of the average size in the United States. Remember, quality over quantity. Okay, I think it's about time for that sunset poem. Nope. That's not any good. Oh, my gosh. Quit apologizing. Just read it. Okay, Ms. Back to the drawing board. That's different. -How's that different? -It's different. Following up expectations, trying to write something that people like. Seems like a great poem to have. You know what else is a great poem to have? Being a talented writer. Okay, let's pump the brakes on the whole writer thing. Being a talented writer who just has to take a leap. Okay, so we both think the other's talented. -Now what? -Sunset poem. You're relentless. "Perhaps it's that twisted lemon, slice of heaven, meringue fluff, with golden crusted constellation crumbs or sherbet rays, the twilight souffle, who knows? Or perhaps the sigh of the breeze pickpockets secrets and tucks them in the clouds on their fly-by. Perhaps it's the hoodwinked clairvoyant horizon that knows when one day comes and another one goes. And perhaps the sun blows kisses to the moon as it departs, they work two separate shifts with one beating heart. Perhaps. Perhaps the snoring mountain turns in her sleep to dream in peace or wish upon a star by the hecks of your hum and the strum of your guitar. Perhaps." Ow! What do you mean "ow?" It's a pillow! I feel like that's the general reaction when someone throws something at you. Get up, sleepyhead. -What time is it? -Just after 11:00. Well, good news is I had a perfectly comfortable bed about 20 feet away, and didn't use it. Did you sleep out here too? Nope. Hey, you ever see The Godfather? Have I seen The Godfather? What do I look like? An idiot? Okay, put some clothes on. Quit hitting me. What are you-- Ah. I see chivalry is not dead. What are you-- Oh, come on! So a few miles up the coast, there is this little town called Savoca. It's where they filmed some scenes from The Godfather. Oh, my brother's gonna love that. He thinks I should be seeing the Colosseum or touring some winery and testing them. I mean, this place has so many gems. So you have a brother? Yeah. Older. He has a family and all that, my little niece, Stella. We actually run the family print shop together. Look at you opening up. We should road trip more often. Oh, hush, don't get used to it. Hey, you know it's rumored that Shakespeare is from Messina. Oh, I know. It's part of the reason I'm here. I think every writer knows that. Hal, I'd like to point something out. You just called yourself a writer. Mm. I present to you the location of Michael Corleone's wedding. Oh, a little slice of history. To go with our pizza. -Works by the way. -I know. Amazing. Hey, you know, I got to tell ya, uh, I feel like this writer's retreat is off to a great start. We're getting tons of writing done. Inspiration is a part of the process. -It's always good to change up the scenery. -Okay. Let me ask you this. -Mm-hmm. -Since we aren't doing much actual writing today. I beg to differ. -You're a folk singer. -Mm-hmm. What exactly makes a folk song a folk song? I mean, folk is kind of a broad term, but folk songs are songs of the people. You can debate genre, or even instrumentation, but I think a good folk song tells a story. -Hmm. I like that. -Mm-hmm. My turn. -For what? -To ask a question. Oh, boy. The relationship is so upsetted. I don't know anything about you. That's not a question. Hal, I'm just-- I'm curious. Hey, listen, I told you my whole life story on the drive up here. You told me that you had a brother. That barely scratches the surface. -You are so demanding. -Why are you in Taormina? Well, uh, we're not actually in Taormina right now, so-- - Why do you have to be so difficult? Okay, you're right. But... -two stipulations. Okay? -Okay. One. If I tell you, you have to promise me something. -Okay. -No, like promise. Okay, I promise. No sympathy at all. None. Got it? -Okay. -Okay. And two, since we are in front of The Godfather landmark, it only makes sense... that I get to do it in my perfect Brando impression -that I know you just love so much. -No. -Nope. Absolutely not. -Yep. It's the only way. No. Okay, fine. Well, that's-- So... you may remember the woman in the photograph. Right? The one you helped me recreate? Well, you probably guessed it. I mean, that's my mother. Right? And, uh... about two weeks ago, she died of cancer. And everybody who knew her said she was just made of light, you know? I mean, she always had the smile a mile wide and she was known to just live for her children. She was the only one... that really gave me confidence, especially in this stuff. Right? And, um... Anyway, so, she left us all a bit of money, and... for me, she told me to do something special, you know? Something real meaningful. And that's a big pill to swallow. So I... decided to come to her favorite place in the world to figure out how best to honor her legacy. And it's the first time I've ever had any money. I didn't know what to do with it, so... I figured I'd try to find the answer here, you know? Sorry. -I am so sorry. -No. No sympathy, -you promised. -How will I not-- I think my Brando slipped into Mike Tyson at the beginning there. How's your dad handling it? Well, depending on what you believe, they've been reunited as it were. So my brother and I, we're orphans now. Wow.

Well, maybe it's because they forgot why they even started in the first place. Or what people connect with. I don't know. That just-- that seems like a recipe for misery. I'm gallivanting around Sicily, staying in this luxurious villa and wasting time, who can relate to that? Hey, don't knock this villa. Someone once told me it's a perfect place for a writer's retreat. Shut up. No, but I mean, come on, all right. Let's-- Let's go back a little bit. There's a-- there's a great quote, okay? Um, "Comparison is the death of joy." -Mm-hmm. -Right? So you gotta stop being so hard on yourself and comparing everything you do to loving right. I mean, it's legitimately a tiny fraction of what's going to be a gargantuan career. -I don't know. -I do. It's easy for you to say, Hal. Everything is so effortless in that notebook. And then you're totally fine with just keeping it all to yourself. There's nothing wrong with being unknown. But there is something wrong with not trying. Writing makes me happy. If nobody reads it... Uh... Who said that? Comparison is the death of joy. Probably Abe Lincoln or Mark Twain. Did you fact-check that? I don't know. According to the internet, they said everything. Ever stood on an active volcano? Nope. This would be a first for me. Are you scared? Oh. No, more impressed. I mean, isn't it crazy to imagine the amount of destruction that thing can cause? But it's just sitting there, peacefully, biding its time and growing wine. You know, if you look over there, you can see the spot where we had the perfect view of Etna. And now we're here. -It's weird how that works. -Yeah. It's also weird that-- I keep thinking, weren't we supposed to get bored today to get some actual writing done? Mm. It's what I'm doing. How can you get bored with all this around? I mean, you shout have stayed in Minnesota or come visited me in Iowa. You'd definitely get bore there. -Did your parents live there too? In Iowa? -Mm. Did you get to spend time with your mom before she passed? Whoa, look at that. You see that? -What? -That's the mood. It just died 'cause you killed it. Okay, Mr. Destructive Volcano. Yeah, I sat with her every day. Good talks? Sometimes. Sometimes we'd just... sit in silence and... actually, I read her a poem every day. We never had that all revealing talk where she imparts her wisdom on how to carry on without her, but I will never forget the way her hands looked. Mm. I can't imagine losing a parent. -Let alone both. -Yeah. That's what I thought too, but if there is any glimmer of positive thing, it's actually when I walked into the funeral hall when I realized that... it brings us together as people. You know, all the petty stuff goes out the window because we all lose loved ones. Um... we all face our own mortality. It kind of snapped life into focus for a second. I just wish they... could've seen their grandchildren grow up, you know. We all want more time. We don't appreciate what we get, so it's... Wow, I'm so sorry I dragged on there. Um, I'm sorry. You lose someone close to you? Yeah. My grandpa. He was pretty magical. World traveler, always curious and... he had this spark that, like, not most people have. You kinda have it. Oh, I have a spark? What does it look like? Shut up. It was a compliment. Jerk. No, seriously, though, he sounds like an amazing man. He was. Definitely something to aspire to, for sure. Hey, Josie. Um... Can you come out here, I have an important question for you, please? About something I found. Yeah. I need you to clear something up for me really quick. What exactly makes a love song... -obscure? -No, no, no, no. -Put that down. -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Oh, no, no, no. We're definitely playing it. Oh, my gosh. It was confusing times in college. Don't you play that. You know, this is amazing. Don't you dare apologize for this. -My gosh. -Uh-huh. And by the way, you look-- What's the occasion? No, I just felt like dressing up. -Is that okay with you? -Yeah. It's definitely okay. But I feel like a lonely peasant. Well, it's our last night to go out. I thought we had tomorrow night. You have an early flight the next morning. Well, I'll go get ready then. Until then, exclusive. ♪ Good night, my ladies ♪ Ooh, I like it. ♪ Good night, my ladies ♪ ♪ I am so sad to see you go ♪ ♪ Merrily we roll along ♪ You clean up nice. Why, thank you.
