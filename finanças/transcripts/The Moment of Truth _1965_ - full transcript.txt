THE MOMENT OF TRUTH Look, your father's waiting for you. He's still out there? He's waiting. Father, how long will it take to finish the job here? Eight or ten days. Come on, move. Father, this time I'm leaving once we're done. Nothing's better than a glass of wine and a slice of bread in your own home. Let's go! This is the son of a friend of mine. His name is Miguel. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. So, what are you doing here? You looking for work too'? My father told me to come see you, that you would help me. What can you do? Nothing, but I'll do anything. You'll do anything. Do you know how many there are like you? - I know, but - - All with no skills. I worked in the fields with my father. - Smoke? - Thanks. - How about working as a laborer? - Sure. It's hard work. You should know that up front, so you don't get any ideas. I know that. In any case, I'm never going back to my town. I'd rather emigrate to Germany. - It's not easy there either. They want skilled workers too. If you had a trade, it would be better. I could set you up right away. You could have a job tomorrow. Do you understand? - But I have to start somewhere. Yes, well, I'm telling you how it is. Tomorrow I'll ask around at the factory. Please, because if I don't find work right away, I don't know what I'll do. Miguel, nothing doing today. I'll look for a room, then. Go to the barrio chino, find Pepe's and tell them I sent you. Let me know, okay? - Sure. Do you have a cigarette? - Here. I have to go. - Let me have another one. - Come on, I'll be late. Thanks. - Do you know the way to Pepe's? - Not really. Try down the street. - Thank you. - Luis. - What is it? - We have a new guy. - Send him up. - Good-bye. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Morning. JAIME'S INN - Passing through? - No, I'm staying. - Where are you from? - From Jaén. Let's see if we can find a nice bed for this handsome young man. Where are you going? it's this way. Yours is number 25. - Don't you like it? - Sure, it's fine. A guy like you won't sleep long in a bed like this. What's your name? Miguel Romero. Miguelin. Hey, you... Where do you work? - Who, me? - Yes. I used to be a stone mason. Now I work in a textile factory. - How much do you make? - As a mason, I made 840 more or less. At the factory, I make almost 600 pesetas. I'm still an apprentice, but it's going to get much better. How did you find the job? I'm from a town near Cadiz. I decided to try my luck here in Barcelona. I said to a friend of mine, “Come with me.” And he said, “Sure, let's go. Let's see what happens.” So we came to Barcelona with no papers and no job. We didn't know where to go so - - What are you blathering on about? You want a job? Go see a moneylender and he'll find you one right away. - Who is this moneylender? - He knows who needs workers. He places you, and since we can't wait till the end of the week for our pay, he gives you an advance on a daily basis. It's that easy? I have a letter from my father for a friend who's been here 20 years. How come I haven't worked a single day? Sure, that's the way it works. If you had gone to a moneylender instead of your father's friend, you'd have a job by now. What do I have to do? Where can I find a moneylender? I can take you to my moneylender. He pockets 25 pesetas an hour. He'll give you a clean 17. Antonio, I've been working for two months and I have nothing. I left the fields... because I was working like a dog, and because I had no intention of ending up like my father. I came to the city because I thought one way or another I would make it. But the city is just like the country, or even worse. I left because what my poor father could give me was not enough for me. You see? - Yes. I came to the city with one idea. I thought all I had to do was ask and I would get a permanent job. Instead I've been working for two months, and nothing's come of it. Did you think they were waiting for you with open arms? You've got to work, stick with it and wait. But if you work for a moneylender, what can you hope to achieve in life? For instance, you have a job. But what have you got? - Nothing. - You have nothing. - Nothing. Do you think it's right for a man to run himself ragged his whole life... with no guarantees for the future? What for? - It's all for nothing. - Nothing. - I agree with you. Do you have a solution? - Listen to me. The only reason I don't steal is because I don't want to go to jail. So, what are we doing? You're going to wear your eyes out. Why don't you make up your mind? - What? Are you going to offer me a drink? Are you buying? Do you have 100 pesetas for me? - How much do you want? - 100. - I haven't got a cent. - That's okay. Not even 100 pesetas? - No. I don't believe it. A stud like you? Listen - Come on, let's go. You'll see, I'm well worth 100 pesetas. Come on. - Why don't you come with us? You won't lose your friend. - Wait. - Come on. Find a girl. Tell the others. Get some girls and join us. - Get a move on! - Okay. El Cordobés, he sure makes money. Yeah, but he risks his life every time. He's been gored so many times. - How much does he make for a fight? - A million pesetas, more or less. Did you hear how much he makes? What about it? That's a lot of money, right? What do you think? Just think, he was a bum like us. Well, let's go get a drink. Here. A cigarette. Lucky guy. If they give me a million, I'll go in the arena and wait for the bull like this. With open arms. Right, who's going to give you that kind of money? I once stood in front of a bull - - Is the maestro here? - He's downstairs. Thanks. - Where's he going? - To the basement, downstairs. - What's down there? - Pedrucho, an old matador. He takes money from suckers who think they can become toreros by going to school. - He teaches in a basement? - Yup. - Unbelievable. - Let's go check it out. Wait here. You, don't get drunk or you'll start blubbering. We'll be right back. Stand up straight. No, no. You don't get it. Keep your hands under the cape. Watch me. Like this. Bravo! But you should be standing in front of a bull. Out! Get out! I said out! Calm down. Let's go. I rent this rat hole to get some peace. While I'm working, it's off limits! Damn those lazy bums. I swear, you'd think for once they could remember to put things where they belong. - May I come in? Who is it? Oh, it's you. Come here and give me a hand. How many times do I have to tell you to prepare the bull? It's like you're doing it on purpose. Every time, put it up, bring it down. Sooner or later it's going to break. Gently, gently! Hey, I don't know you. Who are you? It's my first time here. - Somehow you look familiar. - No, no. Maestro, they tell me you're the only one who can make me a torero. That's why I'm here. - Where are you from? - I was born in a town near Jaén. And just 'cause you're from Andalusia you think you can be a torero? - In fact, I'm here to learn. - Good. Have you ever seen a bull? - Yes, a few times. In my town, at a capea. - Oh, at a capea. Are you sure? - Yes, of course. Okay, show me. No. Leave it. What did you do at the capea, run away? Bullfighting is an art. You need grace, time and a great elegance. Only if you can close with a rebolera like this one will I have faith in you. Listen carefully. Do you know what the bull is? The bull is sacred. Bullfighting is for real men. Not everyone can do it. It requires extraordinary sacrifice. You must hold the bull at all times in your head and in your heart. And no women. Women... I know what they're all about. They'll break your legs. And remember: no wine, no parties. You must think only of the bull. It's the only way to become a torero. Maestro, how much will these lessons cost me? I usually charge a registration fee of 500 and then 100 a month. Does that seem expensive for something that will make you rich? Don't you have a job? - Yes. I've done a few days in construction or down at the docks, whatever work I can get. Okay, I understand. Give me something and we'll work it out as we go. Come on, let's work. Pay attention. Watch him, he's very good. Do what he does. Take your time. Slowly, gracefully. Bullfighting is an art. Okay, now do it by yourself. Let's see what you can do. Good, you're doing better already. Very good, excellent. Now show me how you finish. Let's go. Okay, keep going. Very good, excellent. Now! You, come here. How is it that you still can't do it? Watch me. One foot on the ground, arms wide open, and stay flexible. Let's see. Okay, pay attention. Chest out and arms wide. Come on, bull! Raise your arms! No, no, that's not right. You have to get closer to the bull, lie on him. Keep the muleta down and your right hand on your chest. Higher up, and your wrist firm. All of you, remember this. Let's go. This is the moment of truth. Come on, let's go. Spread out more. Take it easy. Don't be afraid. He's just a calf. Be gentle. One at a time, otherwise you'll confuse him. - Maestro, can I try? - Go. They all want to try and then they shit their pants. Stop it! What are you doing? Stop it! Is this supposed to be a bull? This is a dog. We're wasting time. - What were you expecting? - A real bull, with real horns. Have you ever seen one? That's what I paid 500 pesetas for. Give me the muleta. Be careful. Don't let anyone see you. Mr. Basauri Pedrucho is requested at the arena police station. What can I do to keep these kids out of the arena? Can I stop them from jumping in? It's their passion. What passion? You use it as an excuse to create a group of deviants. For every one who succeeds, there are 99 others who end up very badly. That's what you say. You see them through the eyes of a man who is in love with the police. You have no idea what art is. You have no idea how much a boy suffers when he wants to be a torero, when his very soul is on fire with his desire to become one. All he needs is someone to understand and help him. He has no choice but to jump into the arena and maybe die for it. But you know perfectly well I don't recommend they do it. Listen Pedrucho, your shenanigans are creating problems for me. Remember, it will be on your conscience and on that of your damn school. Okay, if that's the way you see it, I'll pay the 500 peseta fine. I'll put the boy on a train to Madrid, and we'll see if he succeeds or not. Don Ernesto! Don Ernesto, how are you? - Very well. - Do you remember me? - Of course. - I'm still waiting. - You're Miguel Miguelin. If you don't give me a chance, I don't know what I'll do. Son, it's not an easy thing. I don't know what Pedrucho told you, but I have to go now. I'm in a rush. - Where can I find you? - Tomorrow at noon at the Tropicana. - Okay. - Bye. Don Ernesto, put me in a novillada. Please, just give me a chance. He's coming, Miguel. Okay, okay. Let's go. Don Moises, this time you'll thank me. - It would be a first. - We'll see. - We'll see. If I could, I wouldn't let this boy slip away from me. - So you want to foist him on me. - Naturally. You can do it. I've heard you're organizing a novillada. Put him in it. You'll thank me. - I'm organizing it for my torero. - Put him in the arena with him. - Have you already fought a bull? - Once, spontaneously. It was in Barcelona. I faced the bull four times. You can see me clearly here. - So this is you? - Yes, I'm clearly recognizable. It would be a shame not to use him. He's very brave, Don Moises. - Courage alone is not enough. - Have a cigarette. - It was a big bull, Don Moises. Yes, he's big... but in the moment of truth - This kid has class. I guarantee it. You've promoted so many young men... Yes, but first I must consult with my boy. - Of course. - My own torero. He's a bit sensitive. Curro. Don Moises, if you put me in the arena, either I'll end up in the infirmary or you won't regret having helped me. Please, Don Moises, give me this chance. I'm in your hands. - I understand, but bulls are expensive. - You can do it, Don Moises. - I can... This is a friend of mine. Don Ernesto, Curro. - Nice to meet you. This young man would like me to help him get his start. Miguel Romero. What do you think? Rather than some upstart with all kinds of demands. Only if you agree, of course. - Me? it's your decision. Okay, we'll talk later. We'll see if it's a good idea or not. Come. Come and see what I've brought you. Look at this fabric. - What a great muleta. I can get two out of it. So soft, it's English flannel. You have to earn it, though. Otherwise, no muleta for you. Let's hope I can make you happy. What about this montera? Look at this. Worthy of a great torero, worthy of Manolete! Beautiful. You try it on. Go on. Look at yourself in the mirror. - What about me, Don Moises? - Leave me alone now. We'll see. Don Moises, please. Curro, you've got the face of a torero. The great torero of tomorrow. Gentlemen, a toast. Miguel, don't worry. Don't listen to the crowd. Just watch the bull. The bull is what counts. The crowd doesn't understand anything. Remember, success in a town like this will be heard of even in Madrid. All of you, on your toes. Otherwise our patron won't feed us any more. Out, get out! Get away! What are you doing? Do you want to fight? Make up your mind. - You fight him. No, no, I told you! This bull is too big! Let go of me! No, I'm not going! - Go on, Miguel! - Wait, what about the president? Come, quick. A toast to one of the greatest matadors, today's phenomenon, Miguel Romero. From now on, thanks to him, every one of you will have plenty of food and drink. Every day, I guarantee it. Your health, Miguelin. Cheers. - I owe it all to you, Don Ernesto. - Cheers. - Thank you. Cheers, boys. Cheers. - Hey. - Don José, how are you? - How are you? Doing well? - I'm fine. Looking for new talent? - I've heard good things about your boy. - Now you'll see for yourself. - We'll see, of course. Don José, pay attention to the boy. - I hope he's good. - It's his turn. After what we've seen so far, he'd better be good. Miguel, Don José Lépez is here. Go get the bull for him. Excuse me, Don José. I dedicate the death of this bull to the greatest bull impresario in all of Spain. For you. Thank you, and good luck, Miguelin. Yes, sir! That's how you fight a bull. Listen, did you sign anything with the kid? - Of course. That's why I'm here. - I'm interested. All right, but I warn you, he's worth a lot of money. - We'll reach an agreement. - All right. Maestro, can I go? Is this telephone working? We're almost ready. Out, out. Madam, even when Miguelin has fights in America, you'll hear his voice. Now you have everything, so you have to put your mind at ease. About everything, because I'm taking care of it. Let's go test the telephone. - Come, Father. - You come along as well, Father. - See? I bought you a house. Now we'll buy some land as well. Then I'll retire, and finally you'll be able to relax. Let's see if it works. Yes, it works. Before you speak, wait for the tone, okay? Yes. I'll call you after every corrida. Don't worry, I'll call you. I swear it. I don't want you to have any worries at all. Do you believe me? - Yes. Don Jose, I've been meaning to talk to you about something. Your 15% seems high to me. Why don't you try to bring it down a little bit? What do you say? - Come on, Miguel. I mean, you owe me everything, aside from your talent. You're buying many things. You make a lot of money. If you think about it, what you give me is perfectly fair. You can't change it. It's tradition. I couldn't change it even if I wanted to. - But I pay for all the expenses. You get your 15% free and clear. - Of course! You're the one making a name for yourself. You could kick me to the curb at any moment. You worry about bullfighting, and I'll take care of business. Miguel, to each his own. Can I have some water? What's your name? - Teresa. - You're not from around here. - No, sir. - Did you come for the harvest? - Yes. - Alone? - Yes. - What? - Are you Miguelin? Yes. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Bye. - Bye. - Everything is riding on today's fight. - How are the bulls? They're all about 1,100 pounds, but all muscle and sinew. You'll make quite an impression. They have good horns, so you'll get more points. It's the perfect fight for you. I'm sure it will go very well. - What about the crowd? - It's at full capacity. This is a great opportunity. Make the most of it. If you can win over the crowd in Madrid, then you've made it. - I hope so. - The high season is assured. Don José has all the contracts open. It all depends on today's results. If the alternativa goes well, the entire season goes well. This is real money. We have to make the most of our moment in the sun. Come in, come in. Have a seat. Miguel, the press is here. Just a few minutes, okay? Miguelin is a bit nervous today. He's celebrating his alternativa. They're going to officially make him matador de toros. Excuse me. - Please, have a seat. - Make yourself comfortable. This is a Swedish model. She wants to meet you. She wants to see a torero up close. It's her first time at the corrida. Tell her that it's not all about the torero. You need bulls that charge and a lot of luck. Yes, of course. - What is she saying? - She wants to know if you're scared. - Yes, I'm always a little afraid. - Of course. I'm sorry, miss. It's getting late. Ladies and gentleman, it's time to go. Let's go, Pancho. - Miguel. - Bye, Pancho. - Good luck. - Thank you. Miss, it's been a pleasure. Miguel, why don't you come out for a drink tonight? - Talk to Don Jose. - He'll be there, rest assured. But now leave him alone. - Good luck, Miguel. Let's go, gentlemen. - Good luck, Miguel. - Bye. - To the bull. - Thanks. Good luck, and remember, everything's riding on today's fight. - Yes, thanks. - Good luck. Leave him to me. This is a real bull. He's a scoundrel. I've never seen anything like it. I wish you good luck, Miguelin. To the bull. Thank you. Is it so interesting? - He wasn't at the bar? - Who knows? It was so crowded. - Careful, don't drink too much. - Look who's here! Tomorrow, in San Sebastian. I said, “Maybe you are!” This is Miguelin. The Marquis of Los Alamos. - Nice to meet you. The Count of Arcadia and his daughter, Natalie. Sit down, Miguel. - Sit here, next to me. Thank you. Make way for the matador. How are you getting home? - It's not far. I could give you a ride. There she is. She's here. I knew it. You'll see, she'll come over here. - She's beautiful. - You think? José Luis, where is he? He's always disappearing. - He's perfect as a guard dog. - Give him here. He's my treasure. Did you know I'm going to New York to model for the exhibition? Really? We've been invited to Brasilia for a competition. - Lots of traveling, then. - Yes, and then we're going to Berlin. I'm undecided, though, because it's very cold there. Excuse me. I must leave you, but I'll be right back. Linda, allow me to introduce a typical Spanish souvenir. Miguelin, a true matador de toros. - Nice to meet you. - This is Walter. - Nice to meet you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Excuse me. Pancho has a good heart. He feeds his little pet. Up to your old tricks, eh? Watch me and tell me if I'm doing it right. How do you hold the muleta, like this, or like this? Pancho, you be the bull. Look, if you're not careful, you'll get gored. - Miguelin, help her. - Come on. Don't make me ask twice. Torero, teach me how to do it. I want to learn how. It's easy. You hold it like this and make the bull go under it. You give it a try. - What did she say? - She said, “Like this?” Yes, like this, but you have to use both hands. She never misses a man. Careful, the bull is coming back! Very good. You're good at it. - I did a good job. Right, Miguelin? - Yes, of course. - So I can come into the arena too? - Yes, of course. - Do you scratch the bull's head? - Yes. Like this? Let's sit down. Come with me. What's this called? - It's called doing the telephone. - The telephone? - Yes. What kind of a torero are you? You're not afraid of the bull. Now, are you afraid of me? - No. Listen, no shenanigans. This is serious. If you're alive, you owe it to penicillin. Otherwise, who knows how many months it would have taken to fix you up. But Doctor, the boy is in his prime. Every day they offer us new contracts. I don't care about that. He must stay in bed. - Did you hear him? Arguing is pointless. - You sign the contract. I have a tough hide. I'll be fine in ten days. I'll sign, but we have to honor our contracts, or we'll pay for it. Hey, Miguel. Can you move your arm? How's the wound coming along? It's scarred over completely. He's in great shape. He's ready to start fighting again. Tomorrow we'll hit the road. Sunday we'll be in Barcelona, and Thursday in Palma. The season is short. If we don't make the most of it, we lose money. And the audience has a short memory, even for such a rising star as him. Besides, if he just sits around, he'll meet a woman and good-bye bulls. Miguel, now it's time for you to start trusting me more. You have to change your attitude. You need to be more self-assured. You can't behave however you want with the press. Some journalists have to be wooed. I can't be running around all the time just to get some of them to support you. Don José, the only reason I'm a torero is to make money. When I have enough, I'll retire. It's the only reason I risk getting gored. MIGUELIN, THE ALGECIRAS CLUB SALUTES YOU Miguel, what are you doing? Are you ready? Still undressed? Look at this great photo. Are you happy? - Whatever. What do you mean, “Whatever”? Nothing seems to matter to you. It's all the same. I make so many sacrifices. I'm making you a rich man. I get you easy bulls like today. All you can do to thank me is tell me it's all the same. I don't know what's wrong. Lately I'm just not myself. This has never happened before. I just can't stay in shape any more. My heart beats as if it were trying to burst out of my chest. The day before the corrida, it feels as if my beard grows faster. At night I feel as if someone were creeping in under the door and getting in bed with me. That's just fear. Everyone has it. Don't worry about it. Maybe it's fear, as you say, but it's horrible. It's like hearing a voice that says, “Is it really worth it? You're 24 years old. You're rich. Why risk being killed by a bull? People won't even remember you. What if it's all a dream? What is it all for? Why don't you forget about bulls? Why don't you retire?” And the voice is right. Why don't I retire? Every day it's there, ready. I feel like I'm going crazy. It's always the same. “Okay, when I come back. When I come back from the fight, I'll tell you.” And the voice answers, “You're such a fool. How do you know you'll be alive?” Come on, Miguel. All toreros go through this. Don't worry about it. It's part of the profession. A young man like you should be strong. Besides, Miguel, all toreros are like warriors. Come on, get dressed and stop thinking about it. Manolo, come and help Miguel get dressed. Hurry up. Is this the place where I have to fight tomorrow? In this town? Yes, this is the town. A famous torero like me has to fight here? Listen, Miguel, to make the kind of money that you make and fight 90 corridas a year, you have to come to places like this. And even worse than this, because they pay as much as Madrid and other cities. It seems to me that you like making money. Why not? But that's not a good reason to ruin my good name. - You don't understand anything. - No, I understand perfectly. When someone like me finally makes a name for himself, he should trust no one. Because in order to make more money, you knock me around the country, far and wide. When I find myself face-to-face with the bull, I'm exhausted. It's too late now. You should have told me this earlier, not now. If I'd known this, I would have gone about things differently. It's not hard to go from stardom to being completely forgotten. If you want to make money, you have to ride your moment. It's all been arranged, Miguel. - Fine with me. - Only if it's okay with you. We'll leave right after the corrida. I'm taking a plane. Are you up for the one in Tenerife? You have to decide right away. Okay, then it's settled. Stick him with the bender/ilas. Kill him right away. Don't waste time. it's not worth it. Give me the muleta. Kill him. Manolo, tell him to kill him. What are you doing? Remove the sword. Don José. Miguel. Don't worry. The season isn't over yet. There are many more corridas. My mother must have... seen me on TV. Tell her it's nothing. THE END
