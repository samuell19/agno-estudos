It'll take some serious firepower to melt the ice off these mountain. Gohan, look there's another dragon ball. That's four now. And they've all been collected within the past three days. There's another one. Just two more and we'll have them all. We'd better find them before it's too late. I've never been this cold. It feels like I'm frozen solid. I know it's tough going partner but we can't back out now. Best thing to do is just keep going ahead. We'll find the dragon balls and be out of here in no time. If we pull this off Gohan, will have all we ever wanted. It's a good thing I stole Bulma's dragon radar when I did and noticed that someone was collecting the dragon balls. I knew that if we could get them before they made their wish, that we could have anything! The world will be at our finger tips. Will be kings among men. Achoo! I seriously hope you didn't tell anyone where we were going. I don't want them cramping my style. I promise Oolong, I didn't tell anyone. So, between you and me, what are you going to ask the Eternal Dragon for anyway? Ahh... I can't believe it they have all seven! Eternal Dragon I summon you! Arise and grant my request! Oolong look! It's too late! There's still time if we hurry. YOU MAY ASK FOR ONE WISH. AND THIS I WILL GRANT YOU. My mentor Dr. Wheelo lies frozen within these mountains of ice. Eternal Dragon, I ask that you melt his icy tomb. So that he may be brought back to life. To rule over this planet as is his right! AS YOU WISH! Oh! It's working. YOUR WISH HAS BEEN GRANTED. MY DUTY TO YOU IS NOW COMPLETE. Oh! Dr. Wheelo is free! Finally our moment is at hand! After 50 long years of beggary _?_ we're able to unleash our plan upon the world! All will bow before us! The strongest guy in the world. [Dragon Ball Z (1990) The World's Strongest} Subtitles By: MightyMike77020 That building wasn't here before was it? Did you feel that? Yeah, an uncomfortable creepy feeling. How do we get in there? I don't think I like where your going with this. Ahh! Oolong! Mr. Piccolo? Gohan, what are you doing here? It's Piccolo! You saved me. Ow ow... Ahhhh!~~~. Where am I? Hey Oolong, wake up. Gohan? What happened? Mr. Piccolo came and save us. I remember. I was really scared back there but you seemed ok. You don't seem to be scared of Piccolo at all. I wonder, why did he leave us here and then just disappear. Listen to me Gohan, you can't tell anyone what happened here today. Why not? Because you promised you wouldn't! Remember? Mom would be upset if she found out I talked to Mr. Piccolo. There! You see! You don't want to upset your mom do ya'?! Let's get out of here. Gohan was gone for 3 days and when he got back he wouldn't tell me where he was or what he was doing. Goku are you even listening to me? The boy needs discipline, he'll never accomplish anything without it. As long as he's happy and healthy then I'm sure he'll turn out just fine. Goku, this is important to me. Gohan needs an education. How is he going to make it out there in the real world? You wouldn't know about that. Stop worrying. Gohan's a great kid you just got to let him be who he is Chi-Chi. You can't tell anyone what happened here today. Remember, you promised. I wonder what could have happened to Mr. Piccolo. Someday I'm going to be a great scholar. Gohan, dinners ready. Gohan, time to eat. Gohan, hey! It was just a dream. Have you finished your studying? I'm almost done. Well hurry up. Then come eat. Mmm. That's strange, he never used to fall asleep studying. I hope this doesn't become a habit. My precious little boy is becoming a lazy delinquent before my very own eyes. This punishment far outweighs the crime in my opinion. All I did was break a lousy dragon radar. Now I gotta cook dinner for her. But it'll probably be a better meal than she'd make. I wouldn't bet on it! I think your main course was done about 30 minutes ago. Oh crap! Ugh! Tell me piggy, is there anything you are good for? I didn't even wanna cook dinner! Then I've got no other choice. What are you going to do? I'll have to order some takeout. - Huh? - Huh? Hey Turtle, get that would ya'? I'm a little busy. Umm... Can I help you ahh! We've come for the one called Master Roshi. Ok. Ah, yeah, he's right inside. Bring him to us. Haa! No need. I'm here, I'm here. Now what can I do for ya'? Dr. Wheelo calls for you, come with us. Sorry, that name doesn't ring a bell. If that's all, I'll excuse myself now. Grr. What's going on? Huh? Yow! Those freaky guys again! Is... everything ok? Yes dear, just go back inside, Bulma. Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! That's just what I expected from the great Master Roshi. Excellent form. I've come to bring you to my master, Dr. Wheelo. He's quite anxious to make your acquaintance. Well, I'm not going anywhere with you, buddy. I think you better do what he says! Eh? Ah! Ahhh! I'm sure you wouldn't want anything bad to happen to the girl. I think you should accept his invitation! It would be rude not to! I suppose you're right. I was expecting more of a struggle than this. But I can appreciate your concern for the girls safety. Dr. Wheelo will be so happy. I can't believe they took Bulma and Master Roshi with them. Yeah. Honestly I'm not that worried. Master Roshi is a martial arts champion after all. I'm sure he'll be able to get the situation under control. But where do you think they took them, Oolong? I think maybe he took them to the Tsumisumbri Mountains. I thought we talked about this already, Gohan. I don't want you hanging around Mr. Piccolo. Aw, but please mom. Sorry to run everybody but I'd better go see if I can find them. I wanna go! You most certainly cannot go. I'm not through with you yet. - But mom! - You're staying right here. Flying Nimbus! Well I'm off. Time for a new adventure. Bye. Please be careful out there, Goku. Don't worry I will. Where are you going? Um... I gotta pee? Go inside like a civilized boy. Mmm. Don't you think it's about time you told us why you brought us here? You should at least let Bulma go. What do you want with her anyway? He's right! I mean, what good am I to you? I'm Bulma. I'm not a fighter or anything. Dr. Wheelo, I'm most pleased to announce that I brought you Master Roshi. Just as you requested. Then get on with it. Yes sir. Yaaah! â€Ž. Yaaah! Bulma! No! What's going on? Allow me to introduce you to the future, Master Roshi. They're my state of the art bio-technical warriors. Kishime. Misokatsun. Ebifurya. Their perfect fighters. Trained in all schools of combat. And their itching to show off what they've learned. I bet I could still teach them a thing or 2. Yeah I'm ready. Come on give it your best shot. That's what I like to hear. It's showtime. Impressive. I was sure he would be no match for my bio-warriors. But he does look to be holding his own. Ka-me ha-me haaaa! Oof! Yaaah! Didn't you teach them any manners? Ya' gotta respect your elders. How could you do that to an old man? Looks like I was right. He was no match for my creations. And he was supposed to be the greatest fighter the earth had to offer. What a pity, I was looking for a challenge. You idiot! Grrr! What did you say? You heard me. Roshi was one of the strongest fighters 50 years ago. But I know someone who's a lot stronger than him! And who would that be? Yes, tell us. Is... there... someone else here? Who said that? How dare you speak to Dr. Wheelo like that! Dr... Wheelo...? Your in the presence of greatness. Dr. Wheelo and myself are the foremost authorities on biotechnology. That must mean your Dr. Kochin! I studied you two back in school. You are responsible for the controversial bio-technical experiments at the beginning of the new millennium. I'm quite impressed, Bulma. That's correct. Wait! But you can't possibly still be alive! I read that while on a research mission in the Tsumisumbri Mountains you fell victim to a tremendous avalanche that engulfed you in ice. And that happened over 50 years ago. So you can't be who you claim to be. He's already dead. You're right! We were swallowed up in that avalanche but I can assure you we manage to survive. Thanks to Dr. Wheelo's scientific genius we avoided death and are both very much alive! And now allow me to formally introduce you to Dr. Wheelo. A-A brain? Oh! The doctors body was destroyed by frostbite after the avalanche but his magnificent brain survived thankfully. Amazing don't you think? The only thing amazing is how you manage to sleep at night after conducting all those inhumane experiments. Silence! Do you realize what his research means to the human race? People we choose will live forever! Enough! Now, who's the strongest fighter in the world? Everyone knows Goku's the strongest! Goku! Did I stutter? Bring him. You don't stand a chance against Goku! Maybe you should just quit while you're ahead. Insolent girl! Where can I find this Goku? What are you gonna do if I tell you? Imagine the combination of the greatest scientific mind in the universe with the most powerful body. With all that power Dr. Wheelo would be able to rule the world! All would fall before his might! Uh??? Insane. You are one lucky lady, Bulma. You'll be witness to the dawn of a new era. Human beings never understood my genius. You always thought of me as a mad scientist, a lunatic. Once my transformation is complete I'll have my revenge. That's just crazy. It'll never work. Silence! You're a fool to doubt our power. A few days ago the forest surrounding South City was enveloped in a tremendous flame. That turned everything to ash. I'm sure you heard about it. You did that? Guilty as charged. It was reported as a bizarre storm. A result of a solar flare or something of the sort. You know how the authorities like to keep things under wraps. No one could explain it because they had never seen anything like it before. It was the awesome power of our new device that cause the destruction. It is this power that will help us get our revenge and what happened there is but a small sample of what we're capable of! We could wipe the life from this entire planet and turn it into a barren desert in the blink of an eye. But after all, what good would this incredible power be if there were no souls left to fear it? Hum? Wait.. Yes... A powerful life force is approaching. Huh? Life force? - Goku! - What! His power is incredible. Goku. He just might be the perfect host for me to inhabit. Goku. Gohan. My sweet little boy is growing up way too fast. I'm sorry mom. Whoa, what is this place. Are you the one they called Goku? That's me! Now tell me what you did with Master Roshi and Bulma. Well there in here with me. Try and see if you can find them! Achoo! So cold! Now let's see how strong he truly is. Attention, all bio warriors, activate: Search and destroy! Hum! Yikes ice! Huh? Oh no! It's so cold in here I can't seem to focus my energy. Yaah! Now what! Yow! I've had enough! Yeah! Yaah! Wow, it's like fighting a marshmallow. Fine! Ahhh! Kaioken! Looks like I took the air out of that guy. Ooh-ahh! Graaah! Huh? This guy is definitely no amateur. I couldn't even trace his energy level. Huh? Rraah! I can't move! So Goku, it seems you've discovered my creations special talent. There will be no escaping now. Time to seal you in your icy grave. You won't. Finish him. Gohan! Where here, dad. Krillin. You should have brought me along Goku. You could have avoided this mess altogether. Good, fresh meat. Take this! Haaaah! Gohan! Krillin! Aaah-ow! Aaah! Kaio... Ken! Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! What! Gohan! Aw, Krillin. Goku we're freezing. Break us free! Daddy! He is the one. After 50 years locked in icy slumber my dreams will finally become a reality. With the power of that body at my control the world will be mine. I'm so cold. It's like I'm frozen inside. I know what you mean. Goku, are you sure this way leads to Master Roshi? I'm pretty sure they're being held at the back of this fortress. Let's move it! Run. Run. The only way is up. Bulma! Goku! Ow! Ahh! - Dad! - Goku! Congratulations Goku, it took quite an effort for you to get this far. Tell me where Master Roshi is and I want to know now! Well, if you're gonna be so pushy about it, he's in the lab. I've been preparing to transform him into one of my bio warriors. What?! Hey! Look up there! - Uh? - Huh? What is that? Is it a human brain? That's not just any brain, it's the brain of Dr. Wheelo. A mad scientist who was presumed dead over 50 years ago but is now back to take over the world. Do not speak that way about the greatest scientific mind in history! You're both nuts! You only use your genius for personal gain. You should be ashamed. What?! Just look how pathetic he is clinging to life in that little fish bowl. He should have died a long time ago. So what? Is he plugged into the wall or something? Together we can do anything. Some have called the technology that we have developed over the years questionable and morally offensive. But the truest scientist, the ones that are remembered by history are the ones called out as lunatics by the world around them. Many times it has been death that has allowed their works to be taken seriously. Dr. Wheelo's body has died but his mind lives on thanks to the fruits of our scientific efforts. Our work will finally be taken seriously. Not even the avalanche that buried us in the ice could thwart our plans. World domination will be achieved once we enhance the human body with our biotechnology. Now thanks to the dragon balls we been given another chance to realize our dream. With my genius and your power. Will be unstoppable. I don't think so! Goku, you better be careful. All he wants to do is take your body hostage. It's a painless procedure and needless to say you'll be quite a bit smarter than you are now. Doesn't that sound nice? I'm just here to rescue my friends and finish you guys off once and for all. I think not. You belong to me now. Ahhh! Daddy! Goku! Goku! Ahhh! You're hurting him. Let him go right now! It's time. Prepare for the transfer. Yes. You won't get away with this. Gohan! It's Piccolo? Mr. Piccolo. Grr. No! Such amazing strength. I can't wait to have that power. Piccolo? Mr. Piccolo. I knew you'd come to help us out. I just knew you would. Gohan stay away! Why'd you do that? Ahhh! Mr. Piccolo! Daddy! How can anyone doubt our power when even the mighty Piccolo bows before our every command! You leave Piccolo alone! It's out of my hands now. Your comrade is now a loyal servant of Dr. Wheelo. Piccolo stop this! Yah! Ahh! Why are you doing this? Piccolo stop it! You've got to stop it! I've had enough of this! Now get me out of here! I don't know how! Ow! It looks like your going to have to cut the power off to this thing first. Ya' think so? How do I do it? Stop it Mr. Piccolo! Stop it! Gohan! Run away! Piccolo, he's changed somehow, run! Ugh... Ahh. Heeyah! Mr. Piccolo what are you doing? Mr. Piccolo, stop! Gohan! No! MightyMike77020. Gohan! Gohan! Ahh. Mr. Piccolo. Daddy. This is your fault. It's all your fault! Ahh! That power. You'll never get away with this! You stinking brat! You should be at home playing with your toys. Kochin, stop angering him. I blame all of this on you! I think I hear your mommy calling. Why don't you run on home ya' baby! Kochin stop it! Leave my dad and Piccolo alone! Ahhh! Huh? Ahhh. Aw! Let Bulma and Roshi go now! Humph. Yah! Yah! Piccolo. Mr. Piccolo? Gohan. This has been very entertaining. I never thought you'd make it this far. No. Oh no! Grr! Aah! Dr. Wheelo!~~~. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Dr. Wheelo>font> Dr. Wheeeee. Goku, once I've taken control of your body I'll finally discard this ugly metal shell. Then will I fulfill my destiny and become the greatest scientist the world has ever known. No! Whoa, his powers incredible. I see, so this was the one who was controlling me like some kind of puppet? Now he's going to pay! Mr. Piccolo! Pathetic. It'll take more than that to bring me down. Kamehameha! Ka... me... Ha... me... Haaaa! It didn't work! Grr! Aah! Aah! Krillin? We didn't even scratch him! I'll have to try the Kaio-ken. Hey! Haaa... No! Gohan stop! Haaa... Aah! Ugh! Grr. Die. Aah! Power Pole extend! Yaaaah! Yaaaah! Yaaaah! Yaaaah! Huh?! Piccolo! You're going down no matter how long it takes me! Kaio-ken times 3 aah! Grr! Kaa mee ha... me... Haa... Grr! Grr! Grr! You can't win! Grr! Whoa! Aah!~~~ Goku, you did it! It's not over yet. Ah? I know he's still alive. There's no way he survived that. I may have lost the battle but victory we'll be mine. I'll focus my energy to destroy the entire planet and Goku with it. Uh! Aah! Get out of here! You don't have much time! Dad, what about you? I have to stay son! This is my last chance to finish him off for good! But daddy! Aah! Aah! This is it! I... I need... Some help, I can't do this alone. I call on all of the inhabitants of earth for help. Lend me your energy. I need all of the help I can get. I need everyone out there if Iâ€™m to save us all from destruction. Please.. Help me. Lend me your energy. What. What's going on. The whole planet. I can feel all the energy gathering now. Hold on, it won't be much longer. Good. I've gathered all the energy I need. What the hell is he trying to do. Spirit bomb! Die. Aah! Daddy! Daddy no! You will never get away with this Dr. Wheelo! Aah! Gohan! Now I'll destroy them all. Mr. Piccolo? Thought you could use some help kid. Thanks. Aah! What's this. Oof. Aah! Aah! Can't I at least land one good punch? Is that all you've got. Your pathetic planet is about to die. Aah! It's time... To finish this. Aah. Aah! Oh no! The earth is depending on me. Spirit bomb! Impossible. Uh? Oh. Oh my. Ooo. Yaaa. Damn you Goku. Yaaa! Aah! Hey! Over here! It's Goku! He's a live! Hey, daddy you awake? Hi guys. Piccolo! Thanks for your help. You should be thanking Gohan. for world domination have been destroyed.> as evil forces are always lurking> friends will be there. Fighting for good.> You know, there's one thing I did like about Dr. Wheelo. Huh? Huh? Huh? He thought I was the strongest fighter in the world. I guess no one told him you're just a dirty old man.
