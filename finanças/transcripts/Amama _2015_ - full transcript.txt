Come on, guys, that's it, good job! Man was born to work, to work! The farm must not be divided. Nu matter what. It is a sacred, unspoken law. Only one of the sons wiH inherit the farm. The others wiH leave and find something else. In the past the heir was always the same, ho matter what. The first born, no-one else. But today things have changed, the heir is chosen. In ourfamily, every time someone is born, we plant a tree. Ready! We a“ have our tree. We grew up with it, we're connected to it. Amama, cur grandma, assigned a color to each one of hergrandchildren. The color representing strength, blood, passion, red,! Is for the one who wiH keep the farm. For the lazy, good-for-hothihg, the weah grandchild, a white tree. And hr me, the impertinent, mean rebel, the devil's color, the hidden color, Mack. Amama's colors determined our future, our past, our Ne. As ii our destiny started in Neolithic times and reached cut through Amama as the sole go-between. My father never asked m y brother about his wishes or interests. Nor did he teH him what he was expected to do. How did Dad take it? He doesn't know yet. He was destined to be the heir and to continue, as aH previous generations had done. But Gaizka Med them. He h“. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow I shall die. Help me. Tomorrow I shall die. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Where is he? Tomés! Tomés! - Tomés! - Let's go. Where were you? Chopping wood. You're never here when you should. Dad. Why do you plow so much land? You're too old for this and you don't need it. If the young ones don't do it, someone else has to. I'm not telling you not to sow, but a smaller area would do just as well. Young people think they know it all. But they have a lot to learn. If we allow the farms to disappear, everything will go to hell. Dad, don't overdo it. Want to know whyl sow these seeds? They preserve our ancestors' wisdom. That's why. It's your turn to take up the torch. I'll keep on sowing as long as I can. He could have been a happy farmer, but he was painted white when he was bum. They called him lazy, weak, good-for-nothing. But he laughed. Actually, he's the happiest one. Nothing worries him. Might be a good idea to open a country hotel. A country hotel with working rights. An excellent excuse to relax and increase the bonding spirit. They never stop working. They like it. Don't fool yourself, it's not work, it's life for them. They work from sun up to sun down. A farmer's always happy: when he sows, because he sows. When he reaps, because the harvest is good. Xabi, be serious. Keeping busy is one thing, but this... Guess how many leek plants he's bought? Planting ten or a thousand is the same to him. I'm worried. Dad wants to go on as usual. What about you? Are you going to stay here? I don't know, I haven't decided yet. - And you, would you live here? - Me? Of course. -L'm a farmer at heart. - Xabi. Coming to visit isn't the same as living here. You two, quit chatting and give us a hand. Sure, Dad. I bet you've bought a thousand leek plants. Planting ten or a thousand, what's the difference? You talk a lot and do little. Lur, we're off! Sara. Bye. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. My Dad and I don't live in the same world. My father's world ends at the farm's boundaries. He has a“ he needs. He feels free here. But his children see iiie differently. The chain that went back to Neolithic times is broken. Amaia. Amaia. What is it? There are apples to pick. Amaia. Be careful. Amaia. Dad, how many pounds of apples are there here? I can help you, but only so far. That's not the point, you must help us. You'd better. Mom. How many buyers do you have? Exactly four people buy apples from her. What will you do with so many? Listen, Amaia, if you don't want to help, just go. Why don't you out down these old trees? Go. Hello, Koldo. Yes. Yeah. No, no, I can't show you anything yet. I'm not finished. Don't worry. It's okay. I'll make it. Yes, all right, bye. EIGHTY AMAMAS When I was a child, Amama often spoke about Judgment Day, saying that when roads and shops would be everywhere, the Antichrist would come and our world would end. of the farm. It was her way of saying that the farm was in danger. Hi, Amaia. - How are things? - Fine. - Koldo's expecting me. - Yes, he won't be long. - Koldo. - Hello. - How are you? -l'm good. - I brought the poster. - Let's see it. Nice, very nice. - When can I see something? - When it's finished. - The date is getting closer. - Relax, I'm going fine. - Your amama? - Yes. Amama Juliana. Hello. Nice, isn't it? Amaia. Don't pet the dog. You'll spoil it. Hail Mary, fuH of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. How Mary, mother oi God, pray Yer us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, amen. Han Mary, MK c§ grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. How Mary, mother oi God, pray Yer us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, amen. What's wrong? How many times have I told you not to take it for walks? It's here to learn to bark. Not to take walks. Why do you always have to give me hell? Come on, dad, tell me, why? Because you spoil the dog. That's why. Sorry, dad, but your world is finished. People live differently now. Can't you see you'll end up alone? You'll still be planting leeks and mom will be canning. Keep quiet, Amaia. Quiet? Like you? You've always kept quiet and obeyed him. You've spent your life working, never daring to say anything. - That's enough. - You're mean, Amaia. What was that? You're mean. Tomés! Tomés! Tomés! What? What do you want? You have no respect. You don't respect anyone. You only think of yourself. It's your fault for giving them stupid ideas. Damn studies. I'm serious. If you don't make up with Amaia, I'll move to town. You too? Jesus fucking Christ. All you can see is this old farm. The vegetables. Those damn sheep. You don't see what's important. I do it for all of you! For us? You care more for the sheep than for us. Where are you going? -L've loaded the car. -l'm not going. We must go on. Go ahead, you go on. I won't o. Is someone coming? Dinner's ready. I'm not hungry. Mom, eat up. I'm off. - Do you need anything? - No, thanks. Bye. Hi, Koldo. I feel terrible, Koldo. I have nothing to show you. I'm sorry. Are you all right? Where's dad? Dad! What happened? Will you please tell me what happened? It's all gone to hell and it's my fault. You know what you've done. You have to fix it. Because it can be fixed, right? Can it be fixed? Dad. Fix it. Yes? Amaia? She's out. I'm Tomés, Amaia's dad. Can I come up? - Come in. - Hello. - Can you show me her room? - Yes. At the end. Come. Come with me. What is it? I kind of fucked my knee. - Let me see. - No, it's nothing. It doesn't look good. - Let's go to the hospital. - Don't make a fuss. - That's nothing? - Get me out of here. Thanks. If you want to be happy for a day, get drunk. If you to be happy for a week, go on a trip. If you want to be happy for a year, get married. But if you want to be happy for a lifetime, dig a vegetable garden, isn't that right, dad? You talk a lot and do little. Come on, work like a man. No, leave it over there. - What use will you make of it? - None today, but tomorrow who knows? Life is full of surprises. Put that one there too. - This? - Throw it out. Throw it all out. Do what you damn want, but don't ask me. 'Tamer. Do you know why your sister painted the trees? Do you know what it's like to hear that you're lazy since the day you were born? - She must have had her reasons. - Dad. For God's sake. That's the way we do things. Do you know how much energy I needed to turn things around? Do you, dad? What can I say? It's easy. Say you're sorry. -$aying it won't change anything. - But it would help. I-\ lot. I know what you feel. Just say it. Christ, dad. Why is it so hard for you to talk? To talk? We were taught to work, not to talk. My father hardly ever talked to us, but I learned everything I know from working at his side. I learned to earn my bread with these hands. But now... Now our hands have little in common. Eighty amamas ago, we iived in Neolithic times. Amama. -$he's not in her room? - No, she isn't. Amaia. Have you seen Amama? Juliana! Amama! Juliana! Amama! Mother! Amama! Juliana! Gaizka. Amama! Juliana! Amama! Juliana! Amama! Everybody's in the woods. Amama. Amaia! Xabi! Amama. Yes. Yes, we're okay. Mind giving me a hand? Subtitles: M. Grange
