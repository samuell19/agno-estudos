Plus, it'll give you a chance to meet new friends. And one of those cheer scholarships wouldn't hurt either. You don't have to remind me. [Class bell ringing] Well, that's my cue.

I'm about to assign you all lab partners for the semester. Ms. Simon, you're late. - BOY: [coughs] Loser. - [Laughter] All right, enough now. When I call your name, take a seat at the table I point to. If I'm paired with her, I'm dropping the class. Let your heart not be troubled. Um... Excuse me, Mr. Bailey. I was hoping you could pair up Shay and I. We work really well together, and I think I focus better with someone I'm more comfortable with. Katrina Smith and Shay Rodriguez, eleven and twelve. Ava Scott and Allyson Simon, three and four. Poor new girl. Zach Cole, Robert Russell, uh, one and two. Jeffrey Schenk and Barry Barnholtz, eight and nine. Hey, I'm really sorry about before. I'm Ava. Allyson. Mind if I sit here? Free country. So you work at the mall? I saw your name tag. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ear! I just want to remind anyone interested that tryouts to join the nationally ranked, award-winning Lionesses will begin today after school on the field. All are welcome. [Cheers and applause] Who is this girl? Hey. Set, hike! [Whistles blowing] [whistles blowing] It's only temporary. It's just like dance. So you think you want to be a Lioness. Do you have what it takes to be part of the greatest organization Roosevelt High has ever seen? We'll see about that. You know, being a Lioness is a lot more than just wearing the uniform. On my squad, I expect discipline. I expect determination. I expect perfection. Now, speaking of perfection, I want to introduce you to the true leader of this team, the talent that has brought us to two back-to-back state championships and will no doubt lead us to a third, introducing your amazing captain, Katrina Smith. [Clapping] Thank you so much, Miss Sinclair. I couldn't triumph without my wonderful team by my side, so thank you all so much for showing up to this year's tryouts. I'm excited to see what you Lioness cubs have to offer. This is my third time trying out. First time for me. You're the new girl. - I'm Julie. - Ava. So you've never been on a squad before? Massachusetts state dance team champions three years in a row. Wow. But Roosevelt doesn't have a dance team, so here I am. I'm a convert too. Gymnastics. I wish I could do that. After my last growth spurt, they said I should probably try something else. At least you can hit all those back tucks and handsprings. I've been working with a trainer all summer. You don't think that's a little much? It's smart. My sister was a Lioness for four years. Roosevelt High has the record for the most CSCA awards. What's CSCA? California State Cheerleading Association. Every year they give an award to the best cheerleader in the whole state. - Comes with a trophy. - And a scholarship. Committee members come to games and rallies, and they decide in the spring. I could really use that. Forget about it. Ms. Sinclair has been grooming Katrina for it since she was a freshman. Okay, first up, Julie. Julie, welcome back. Who knows? Maybe this is finally your year. When you're ready. Come on, come on! Say, "Let's go, Lions!" Let's go, Lions! Nice job. Thanks. You look like you've lost a little weight since last year. Um, yeah, I really want this. Good for you. Thank you. Okay, next up, Ava. You're in my chem class. Yeah. I'm Ava Scott.

Thank you. ♪♪ [Upbeat] Sorry it's so rushed. I actually have to go back to the office for a few hours after we finish. That's okay. It's actually really good. Oh, you're complimenting my cooking? Things must have gone very well today. I went to cheer tryouts. And? I had more fun than I thought I would. Don't do that. Do what? The boastful "I told you so" look. That's not what I'm doing. Okay, maybe a little, but I did tell you. The squad is really good. People seem to respect them here. It's not just a joke. Well, as it should be. And you were right. There is a scholarship. But you have to be the best in the whole state. Let's just see if I can actually make the team first. You're gonna make the team. What makes you say that? Because you're beautiful, and you're talented, and they'd be so lucky to have you. You're my mom. You have to say that. Okay, all right. I will just get ready for another "I told you so." [Giggles] I'm just so happy to see you're getting back to your old self. Ava! Great job yesterday. You got some mad skills. Thanks. Maybe I'll see you around. Oh, you're so sweaty. [Tires screech] Whew! I am so sorry. Are you okay? Yeah. It was totally my fault. I wasn't looking. I'm pretty sure if I'd hit you, I'd get full blame. I guess it's good you didn't hit me then. Well, I'm Patrick. Ava. I saw you at tryouts yesterday. You got some good moves. Thanks. You're on the team, I presume? What gave it away? So did you make it? We find out tonight. Well, I hope you do. Then maybe our paths will cross more. And by "cross," I mean I'll see you on the field and not almost hit you with my car. That would be cool. Paths crossing and not getting hit by your car. - [Giggles] - You need a ride home? No, that's okay. Thanks. My mom's supposed to pick me up soon. Another time then. - [Car door closes] - [engine starts] [tapping key] Mom, refreshing it won't make it post any sooner. Back in my day, we had to wait until the list was posted outside the coach's office. [Doorbell rings] - Hi. - Hi! You must be Mrs. Scott. I am. Is Ava in? Katrina, hey! Hope I'm not intruding. No, no, not at all. Mom, this is Katrina. She's the cheer captain. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Hi. I was a cheer captain in my day too. I should have guessed Ava's talent ran in the family. So Ms. Sinclair is about to post the roster online, but I wanted to tell you in person. Welcome to the Lionesses! - Honey, congratulations! - Thanks. I see something special in you, Ava, and I really wanted to welcome you personally. Thank you. Well, I will let you two celebrate. Congrats again, and wear your uniform on Monday. - Bye! - Bye. Ooh, honey, I'm so proud of you. You've come along way since-- Oh, my gosh, these colors. These are gonna look so good on you. And that Katrina, she seems like such a sweetheart. She does, doesn't she? I told you this is gonna be a great way for you to make new friends. Yeah, it is. [Giggles] She's really good. Are you worried? Let's see if she can make it through the end of the season. - [Engine starts] - We're far from done yet.

Ava, Ava! Hey! Oh, I was so glad when I saw your name on the list! Ask my mom. I almost went into anaphylactic shock! I can't believe I actually made it this year! Look at us. It does feel really good. You look so pretty. You too. It's a little tight on me, but Katrina said it'll be motivation to work out harder. Of course she did. Look, it's Tiffany and Haley! [Class bell ringing] [applause continues] So... how's your first day in uniform? I think more people have said hi to me in the last five minutes than in my entire life. [Laughs] This school knows what's up. The uniform means you're talented, you're hot, and you run with me. [Clears throat] You girls mind if I start my class? Well, of course. Floor's all yours, Mr. Bailey. All right, open up to page 14. Miss Scott, would you mind reading the first paragraph, please, to the class? You made the team! What gave it away? So how are you enjoying Roosevelt High so far? Better than I thought I would. It was a smart move trying out. Getting in with that crowd helps a lot. So I'm learning. I'll let you get to lunch. Congrats again. Thanks. See you on the field. Where the hell do you think you're going? Um, I was just gonna-- - You are a Lioness cub now. - [Giggling] So I saw you were talking with Patrick. Yeah. I met him the other day. He's really nice. You could do better. What do you mean? He's a backup receiver. I don't know what that means. It means he's not a starter. Okay. Look, I just want you to know that being on my squad means you can have any guy you want. Star athletes, college students, teachers. It's not even like that. Take my boyfriend, Ryan, for example. He's an all-state quarterback. I really don't care about that kind of stuff. You will. Image is key.

Especially Katrina. What? [Class bell ringing] Allyson, wait a sec. Ava. Katrina, hey. Trust me, the less time you have to spend with her, the better. Poor girl. Why do you say that? You haven't heard? She has a major drinking problem. Allyson? You mean you haven't noticed she reeks like a wino? She got arrested last year. Drunk and disorderly. She actually made the squad, but after that happened, we had no choice but to cut her. Wait. Allyson was a Lioness? It's a terrible disease, and I feel awful for her, but we have a reputation to protect. Want me to talk to Mr. Bailey about assigning you a new lab partner? Oh, no, that's okay. I don't mind. Just be careful. I will. So are you excited about your first pep rally tomorrow? Very. I want you right up front next to me. Show off our new star. [Giggling] [stomping, clapping] KATRINA: Ava. Ava.

[Cheering] Whoo! Whoo! No one ever clapped like that in gymnastics. Seriously, they loved us! Do you see those people with the clipboards? They're on the CSCA committee. They were taking notes when we were performing. I'm sure they were just here for Katrina. I don't know. I saw them looking your way, Ava. Really? You must think you're pretty good, huh? No. It's not like that. Well, now that you've got your feet wet, let's see if you've got what it takes to swim. - My sister had to do this. - Do what? Several initiations will be taking place in the coming weeks. You'll never know when or where, but attendance is mandatory. Tonight is the first night. I'll text you all the address. Be there at midnight. Wear your uniform. Katrina? - Mm-hmm? - I have a curfew. What part of "mandatory" do you not understand? I know it's dumb, but I got into some trouble last year, and I really need to stick to my mom's rules. So sneak out. I can't. I want you to ask yourself a question: Are you a lioness... or you a zebra? A lioness. Then grow some fangs. See you girls tonight. Guys, this is breaking and entering. Is it? Does anyone feel the need to contact the police? Relax. My mom's a realtor. Then let's get started. That's far enough. A toast. To our new Lioness cubs. I-I don't drink. - Excuse me? - I get sick. How are you going to handle the stress of being a Lioness if you can't handle a wittle-itty-bitty Jesus juice? I-I'm sure one won't hurt. [Coughing] Now... - [bell ringing] - In the elevator. Let the games begin. [Whirring] Oh, hell no. We just have to do what she says. It's all part of the program. I don't feel so good. What are you up to, Katrina? [Whirring stops] Hello? Is anyone down here? [Screams] There's someone there. I think I'm gonna be sick. - [Growls] - [screaming] Are they crazy? They're probably just messing with us. They wouldn't actually lock us in here. This looks like a real lock. Let's see how you do under pressure. Okay, just look for a way out, maybe a key. It's like Katrina said. She's testing us. Is it just me, or is this cage getting smaller? I thought when she said "initiation," she meant like go camp in the woods or something. What is that? Something isn't right. Something's on fire. I don't like this, guys. I'm serious! The building's on fire! We're trapped! I'm sure it's not like that. Katrina? Katrina! Katrina! Maybe they've had enough. Not even close. Katrina! Katrina! They're gone! They left us! Haley, Haley, look at me. Breathe. We're gonna be fine. It does smell like something's burning. Katrina! Shay! Rita! Are you guys out there? What's happening? You guys, I can't breathe. I don't think I can breathe. Stay calm. We're gonna find our way out of here. Bobby pin. I need a bobby pin! Does anyone have a bobby pin? - Here, here. - Thanks. - [Coughing] - Almost there. Hurry! Come on. Come on! I got it! [Slow clapping] Congratulations. How'd you learn how to pick a lock? Seems some of us are just full of secrets, aren't we? [Haley coughing] Maybe we should bring her to a hospital. - Haley! - [Coughs] Relax. She just hyperventilating. What's going on? You escaped. Well, your teammates did. You, on the other hand, were a hot mess. - She was just scared! - What did I tell you? The important part of cheer is being able to perform well under pressure. [Shay clears throat] [whirring] Clearly Haley cannot perform well under pressure. She choked! It's a real shame. You know, your sister was one of the best. What do you mean? Haley's off the team. W-W-Wait, please. I'm sorry. I'm just claustrophobic. The vodka went right to my head. Why do you think these traditions are so important? You're just not Lioness material, Haley. What if we all had failed? You didn't. [Giggles] Morning. Morning. How'd you sleep? Fine. It's funny. The outside motion sensor was tripped last night. Probably just a raccoon. Yeah, probably, because I know it couldn't have possibly been my honest, well-behaved daughter. All right, I need to go finish getting ready for work, so have a great day at school. When I first made the team, Ryan and the other upperclassmen made us do a bunch of stupid crap too. It's all just part of the newbie package. I feel bad for Haley. She made it through the tryouts and then to just get cut like that... It's an archaic tradition. Just a way to tell incoming members they have no power or say in anything. It sucks, but it's part of the whole stupid high school food chain. Hey, what's up, Ava? A chain which you seem to be climbing very quickly. People are just nice because they like watching me in a tight skirt. Ah. I know I do. [Giggling] Hey, what are you doing tonight? I don't know. Why? I was thinking, maybe if you wanted, we could grab a burger or something after practice. Are you asking me out? Um, yes. Took you long enough. I mean, you almost hit me with your car. A burger's the least you could do. [Laughing] So it's a... That's an I'd-love-to.

He played in college, so I know he'd love if I followed in his footsteps, but... it's just not a career, you know? How about you? You close to your dad? He... He passed away a little over a year and a half ago. I-I'm so sorry. It was a car accident. One minute he was here, and the next, he wasn't. That must have been awful. He was always my biggest fan. He came to every single dance competition. Every time I danced, I knew somewhere out there, he was smiling. Hey. He still is. I took it really hard. Like really hard. I stopped going to dance practice, and I started acting out. Skipping school, abusing Adderall, sneaking out. It got so bad, my mom had to send me to this troubled teen program. The place was miserable. It was for straight-up delinquents, and I hated it. Eventually, she found a new job out here and thought the change of scenery would be good for me. I'm so sorry. I did not mean to dump all this heavy stuff on you so fast. No, it's okay. It's part of your life, and I want to know about it. She is really happy about the whole cheerleading thing though. But what about you? Are you happy? Sure. After everything that happened last year, I have a life again. Maybe even the possibility of a scholarship. Even if that means being on a team with Katrina Smith? Okay. She's a little high-strung. Yeah. You know... she asked me out last year. Wait. Katrina Smith asked you out? It's not that hard to believe. No, no, no! It's just... You don't seem like her type. Here you go. Yes. Thank you, Charlie. Oh, my God. This is huge. Best burgers in town. Sorry. I come here way too much. I'm eating this entire thing. Just letting you know now. Good. Me too. [Giggles] Is it weird that I could still go for dessert after a burger, fries, and a milkshake? A little, but I could too. Then next time, we'll make sure to get dessert. Glad there will be a next time. I'm glad that you're glad. [Giggles] So I don't mean to rush things, but... would you go to homecoming with me? I hear it's a big deal. It's pretty much mandatory for everyone on the football and cheer team, so... Then yes. Sounds like it could be fun. Fair warning though. We probably don't have a shot at king and queen. Let me guess. Katrina? And Ryan. Every year. [Laughing] I had a really fun time tonight. Me too. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. [Exhales] [chuckles] [toilet flushes] Hey, Haley. How are you? How do you think I am? I'm really sorry about what happened. It's not fair. You don't seem sorry. What do you mean? You went along with it. - It wasn't my call. - Oh, right. And that just makes everything better, right? Thanks for sticking up for me. She still sulking? The team meant a lot to her, Katrina. And it doesn't to me? Why do you think we do this? To ensure we have the best team possible. You know, I heard a few students talking about how they nominated you for homecoming queen. Really? They nominated me? Can't say I'm surprised. Who wouldn't want something fresh, new, exciting, beautiful, with a perfect... tight... little body. I just don't want you to get your hopes up too high. This school's only big enough for one star. [Camera clicking] Okay, one more. Mom, we're gonna be late! I know, I know, but you look so beautiful. What about me, Mrs. Scott? Do I look beautiful? Oh, Patrick, you look the beautifulest. Okay, seriously, we have to go. Okay, all right, I got it. Oh, your dad would be so proud of you. Thanks, Mom. Don't forget your curfew. Mom, I was hoping you'd be a little more relaxed about that tonight. There's a little get-together after. Aha. Like a party? Sort of. It's mostly cheer girls and a few other people. Have her home by midnight. Absolutely, yeah. Have fun. Bye. [Door opens, closes] ♪♪ So this is why everyone left the dance early. We don't have to stay long. I just know the girls on the team said it was important to make an appearance. No, it's cool. We'll have fun. ♪♪ [Continues] Look who's here. Ava came with Patrick? How embarrassing. Rita, I'll be right back. Okay. [Scoffs] Shay! Katrina! You have already had like three flasks at the dance. Slow down. I don't want to take care of you like last year. Hey, hey, hey, congratulations! You are-- You're the best. And as the best, I need you to do a little something for me, okay? You see Ava over there? [Whispering] [laughing] Can I get you a drink? Water would be great, please. I'll be right back. Okay. Having fun? Yeah. Congratulations on getting queen, by the way. Thanks. I was worried there for a sec. First time a new member of the squad has ever been on homecoming court before. I never stood a chance against you. True, but you look really pretty tonight. Thank you. Well, I'd better get back to my king. Yes. She's got a thing for you, girl. Who, Katrina? No, the other captain that totally showed you off at the pep rally. I don't think it was showing me off. It's okay. Just own it. Katrina likes you the best. I should go find Patrick. What the hell, Shay? Ava. - Ava. - Excuse me. Ava. It's not what you think. I know what I saw. Yeah, she came on to me. Patrick, please. I feel like such an idiot. I trusted you. How could you do that? I didn't. Ava, don't do this. It's not at all what it looks like. Shay is really drunk. Just leave me alone. Ava... I said leave me alone! You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just want to be alone. I saw what happened. I'm sorry. Shay can be kind of a slut, and Patrick always had a thing for her, so... Look, why don't I give you a ride? Looks freezing out there. Mm-hmm. I should've listened to you about Patrick. Yeah, well... we all do stupid stuff when it comes to guys, right? The Patricks of this world, they're losers. They do weird shit to try to get to the top. But you don't have to worry about that. You're already at the top. Thanks. Of course. I got you. We're teammates. What time is it? Um, almost one. [Scoffs] Shit. Oh, right. Your curfew. What's that all about? I snuck out a lot last year. Drank, got into a ton of trouble. I stopped going to dance. My mom was sure I was on drugs. Were you? Adderall occasionally, but it was only because I was pretty messed up about losing my dad. He was my everything. You'll be okay now. [Door opens, closes] Do you know what time it is? Sorry. I lost track of time. That doesn't look like Patrick's car. Katrina gave me a ride. Oh. I'm tired. Going to bed. Have you been drinking? No, Mom. - Ava... - I just want to go to bed! Go get some sleep. Night. Good night. You didn't answer any of my calls. That's because I don't have anything more to say. She kissed me. I would never do that. I like you, Ava, a lot. Ava, is there a problem? Go away, Katrina. Oh, you know, before I forget, Shay wanted me to tell you that she's not interested in you, and she's really upset that you took advantage of her while she was drunk. And you've been jealous since day one. Come on, Ava. [Class bell ringing] ALLYSON: Did you finish? Finish what? The assignment. Bioconjugation. I'm so sorry. It was homecoming weekend. Don't worry. I'll get us an extension. Assignment? Actually, Mr. Bailey, I'm so sorry, but I dropped the ball on this one. With homecoming and two cheer practices a day, I didn't get the chance. Could you give us a few more days, please? All right. Don't let this happen again, okay? I won't. Thanks. You're the best. See? Easy. [Scoffs] It's too late. What? No. Didn't you just hear him? I'm not talking about the assignment. Uh, hey, I just wanted to make sure that we we're cool. Yeah, sure. Whatever. Cool. - Congratulations! - What? You didn't check the CSCA Twitter this morning? No. Why? You and Katrina were named top ten contenders to watch for this year's Cheerleader of the Year award! Wait, what? - Oh. - Julie. Hey, are you okay? Just a little lightheaded. I've been trying this new juice cleanse, and I almost passed out in homeroom this morning. Why are you doing that? I mean, look at me, look at you. Julie, you're beautiful. Don't-- Don't do that. My mom does that. You are. You said her being good would make me look good. And it did. No, I made her look good, and now she's got a real shot at this thing! So work harder. Uh-- I'm better than her! My job is to make this team the best it can be. You're my captain because you share my vision. I do, but I also know that I deserve Cheerleader of the Year. - No one else. - Okay. Then prove it. I intend to. Good. Great. Out! We'll see who's Cheerleader of the Year. Bitch! Hey! I'm heading to Julie's to study! Tonight? Shouldn't be too late. All right, well, have fun. Thanks. Hey, Ava. What? I want you to know that I do trust you. I know that you're always gonna make good choices, okay? All right, don't be too late. Get your work done. What's going on, Katrina? Why are we here? You've proven you can perform well under pressure, but that's not all that makes a true Lioness. Tonight we're going to put another important qualification to the test. And what's that? Physical fitness. What, are you gonna make us run laps or something? Oh, that's cute, but no. I want you... to strip. While you're recording? The camera never lies. And in cheer, looking good means everything. Unless... you have something to hide. We are now streaming live to every student at Roosevelt High. RYAN: Hey, check it out. Katrina just sent out this link. Oh, hell yes! Down vote the pig! What's going on? You didn't get the link? Vote for the hottest Lioness. Yeah, sorry, dude, but your girlfriend has some serious issues. You should be pumped. At least you'll finally get to see what's under Ava's shirt. All right, ladies, chop-chop! Take it off. [Katrina giggles] Oh. Julie, come on. Give us a little sneak peek. I'd rather not. You know, some guys actually prefer a little junk in the trunk over the anorexic look. I'm just tall. It's just us girls, right? Take it off! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off! Enough! You can put it back on. How are people going to vote if they can't see? Wait, what do you mean, vote? Why do you think I'm recording right now? We're hot, we're fresh, we're now. And we are live, baby! What? And the survey says? Looks like Ava's got them all beat. Are you insane? Disconnect it now! Hey! Do you want to be a cheerleader? Do you want to be a star? Then you can't be afraid of the public. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Turn it off, Katrina! Hey. I'm not gonna force you to do anything that you're not comfortable with. Feel free to leave anytime you want. That would, of course, mean that you'd be off the squad. Being judged comes with the pompoms. I'm just trying to prepare all of you. Like I said, it's totally your choice. No, I do want to be on the team. Then grow a pair and show us your goodies. Ava, what are you doing? I'm with Julie. Did you not hear what I just said? Come on, Julie, let's go. If you two leave, it's sayonara for you bitches. Oopsy. Way to go, Patrick. Your stupid girlfriend ruined the show. See the way she knocked the camera out from Katrina's hand? That's embarrassing, man. You're finally up. Didn't sleep much. Does it have anything to do with the message I got from Ms. Sinclair, saying how sorry she is that you quit the team? That was fast. So what's going on? I just don't think cheer's a good fit after all. Well, I don't understand. You were loving it. Things change. Ava, what is going on? Nothing! It's just not for me, okay? Then maybe you can explain why your uniform reeked of vodka. Mom... I'm worried about you. And you have been really distant lately. It's not what you think. Then what is it? Talk to me. Tell me what is going on. It's... nothing. Honey, I looked into a place nearby. It's a lot nicer than the Center. It's more like a retreat. Mom, I'm not going anywhere! You can't just send me away because you think I have issues. I want to help you. I know you snuck out, and I know you were drinking, and I'm not so sure you were even studying at Julie's last night. You really don't trust me, do you? Ava, I want to. You have to understand that's it's hard for me to. [Scoffs] Ava! [Door opens, closes] [soft chatter] Hey, did you see that livestream last night? - Yes. - Wasn't it awesome the way that new girl totally showed up Katrina? Oh, my God, that was so cool the way she threw down the camera like that. Yeah, how embarrassing. MR. BAILEY: You want to be very careful when pouring the bleach in the beakers. Also, record all your observations on your lab sheet. I'll start setting up the food dyes if you measure out the hypochlorite samples. You made a terrible mistake, embarrassing her like that. She's just an attention-seeking bitch, I think I'll be okay. She won't let it go. Hey. I wanted to thank you for what you did. I should've done something sooner. It's okay. I get it. I got swept up in how she is and how I thought she made me feel. I wanted to be a cheerleader for so many years. I thought I'd do anything for it, but in that moment, knowing all those people were watching, I just-- I couldn't. I think we should go to Ms. Sinclair and tell her what happened. Haley already tried. She basically just told her it was all a misunderstanding. The success of the cheer program is the only thing that matters to her. Katrina wins championships. She's not going to jeopardize that. It's not right. You remember Julie's face? How could I forget Jumbo Julie screaming for five minutes straight? I heard it got a thousand views. Did you see how many votes Ava got? I think it was just seeing somebody deny Katrina. She's such a dumb bitch. Katrina? No. Ava. I mean, she's an idiot for throwing that all away. We're royalty here. Now she and Fatsy are back to being dirt. Plus, now I don't have to pretend to like Patrick anymore. Gross. I thought you made out with him at the after-party. Katrina had me do it just to screw with Ava. That is evil! You should've seen Ava's face. Katrina thought it'd help her gain some power over her. At least now that's Ava's out, Katrina doesn't have to worry about somebody stealing her precious throne. Maybe now she can stop being such a psycho. Yeah, as if that's ever gonna happen. Hey, I'm looking for Patrick. Have you seen him? Mm-mm, mm-mm. - She's toast. - Yeah, man. That's her. Ava Scott, can you tell me why there's stolen Oxycodone in your locker? No. I mean, it's not mine. Miss Scott, we got an anonymous tip this morning, and given our zero-tolerance policy, we searched your locker immediately. I have no idea how it got there. Do you share this locker with anyone? - No. - Does anyone have your key? No. Are you aware of the criminal charges for possession of this on school property? I swear, it's not mine! Ava, please follow me to my office. Your mother is on her way. Mom, please, you have to believe me. They weren't mine. I just wish you would've come to me first because if you felt like you were slipping, you could've talked to me. I wasn't slipping! I had nothing to do with this! You just got suspended for having drugs in your locker! You do understand why this is so hard for me to believe you. I know, but I wish you would. Well, maybe if last year didn't happen, I would. But, Ava, I am so worried. I don't even know what to do anymore. I never took Oxy! Last year I was upset about dad, and I skipped school a few times, drank once or twice. It's not the same thing. It can snowball. But it hasn't. Please. Listen to me. I didn't do it. Okay, then who did? I think it was Katrina. The cheer captain? She's not who we thought she was. I'm going to prove it to you and everybody else. Maybe this was just too much for you, after Dad. You know, the move, the new school. [Scoffs] - [car alarm beeps] - [car door closes] [engine starts] You're going down. Ava. I need to talk to you. I thought you'd be grounded. Luckily my mom works too much. So it's true what they said. Yeah, but they weren't mine. Look, I need to apologize. I know you didn't kiss Shay, that it was all Katrina. Yeah. I tried to tell you. And guess who put those pills in my locker? Wow. She's a horrible person, Patrick. The hazing needs to stop. Her control over people needs to stop. She needs to be stopped. I want to expose her for who she truly is. I don't know if we can do it alone. Do you know anyone else that could help us? [Scoffs] What are you doing here? We want to stop Katrina. Allyson! You can't. I know you were a Lioness. That was another life. What happened? Same as you. Just wasn't my thing. Bullshit. It was Katrina, wasn't it? That's why you warned me about her. It's why you walk the other way every time she's around. [Sighs] At first, everything was great. I made the squad. People liked me. But then initiations started. They made us stand blindfolded, and Ryan and a few other starters from the football team kissed us. Then they ranked us on how good we were. I-I refused to do it. It felt wrong and dirty. Katrina told me that I can make up for it by doing something else of her choosing. I agreed. I wanted to stay on the team. Katrina, Rita, and Shay showed up in my room in the middle of the night, and then they blindfolded me and brought me to the field and ordered me to strip, ordered me to drink. A lot. Then campus security showed up. I later figured out that Katrina called them on purpose. They charged me with underage drinking, drunk and disorderly conduct, and indecent exposure. I mean, I tried to talk to the police and tell 'em that it was all Katrina's fault. But when they talked to Ms. Sinclair, she vouched for Katrina. She didn't want to lose her prized captain. And would you believe that... Katrina told my parents she was sorry, but had to kick me off the team because I had a criminal record. She's a monster. That's putting it lightly. We're gonna put an end to all of this, make sure she stops hurting people. You can't. Hey, the Lionesses are the pride of Roosevelt High, She has everyone in her pocket. There's nothing you can do. No one will believe you. She already got me suspended. I think it's time we get even. You'll need proof. What about the livestream? It was deleted. I checked. [Phone ringing] Wait. Tiffany's calling me. Tiffany? I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be talking to you, but I didn't know who else to call. - What has she done now? - Nothing yet, but at practice, she said since things went so wrong at the last initiation that she's raising the stakes on this one. Raising the stakes? What does that mean? I'm not sure, but when she looked at Shay and Rita, even they seemed freaked out. I'm scared. Okay, did she tell you where to go? Yes. I'm on my way downtown right now. Downtown? Downtown where? She'd be so mad if she found out I was talking to you. I can't help you if you don't tell me, Tiffany. Where are you going? She said to meet on the roof of the building we broke into. The roof? I guess the other cubs just didn't have what it takes. I have a problem putting too much trust into people. But not with you, right, Tiff? You won't let me down? I knew you were the best. So tall. So skinny. One last task, and you're on the team for life. What do you want me to do, just sit here and drink? I want you to walk. Walk where? Follow me. Along there. TIFFANY: You're joking. What's the matter, don't you trust me? You sure you wanna do this? It's the only way. Oh, come on! Some gymnast you are. This thing is twice the width of a balance beam. I-I can't do heights. You have nothing to worry about because you'll be wearing this. RITA: Tell me you're just messing with her. If she falls, she dies. Motivation to not fall. Ready? AVA: I wanna try! Ava? What are you doing here? I want back in. Excuse me? I made a mistake. I never should've walked away from you, from the team. I know I ruined the livestream. I'm sorry. But now I understand why you do these initiations. The Lionesses have to be better than everyone else. Please. I can't go back to who I was before I met you. I'm glad you came to your senses. So I can come back? If you complete one last task. That's why I'm here. Give me the scarf. Wait. What about the suspension? Gone. How are you gonna do that without giving yourself up? I'll tell Mrs. Williams I overheard a couple burnouts bragging about it. That's the thing about being me. People seem to believe anything I say. I'm impressed. You must really want back on the team. I do. Don't wanna end up like Allyson. [Ava panting] KATRINA: Now climb up. [Katrina giggling] How much further do I have? A lot. Keep going. Got enough? Yeah, I got it. I've been livestreaming all of this to Mrs. Williams. Oh, yeah, and the entire police department. You! You did this? Wave to all the parents and teachers watching what you make students do just to stay on the team. I... No, no, I've been framed. Really? Put it down. Put it down! - [Screams] - No! - [Screaming] - TIFFANY: Ava! Ava! Ava! Take my hand. - I can't! I'll fall! - Take it! No, I got you. Come on. Are you okay? - Did you get it? - Yeah. Sent a link to every parent and teacher email on the system. We're good. - We got her. - Yeah. Wow. I... I had no idea that Katrina was doing this kind of thing. I would never have let that happen. I just thought it was fun and games, I didn't realize the extent of it all. Maybe you'll realize this: You're fired. - Fired? - Yes. Do you know what I've done for this school? Do you know how many trophies my girls have won? You have done enough. - I had nothing to do with this! - The evidence is right here. - Excuse me. - I think we can see clearly! Championship after championship! This might not be a great time, but we should probably break up. [Cheering] Bye. [Cheering continues] I'm glad you're okay. I'm sorry I didn't believe you about Katrina. I had no idea what was happening in your life. It's okay, Mom. I let it get too far. I should have let you in on what was really happening. I promise I'll do better. Me too. I love you more than anything. I love you too. [Stomping, clapping] Introducing our Roosevelt High Lionesses!
