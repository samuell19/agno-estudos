For a minute he can call all the shots. For a fleeting moment or for an eternity. When that happens, something terrible, or something great, time passes differently in here than usual. He flies in the air. Or is he right on the spot. There seems to be no end. The only back up he refuses to turn the minute hand. A MOMENT OF SILENCE As Siegfried Lenz Excerpt & correct sub-headings: *** paminotu *** Damn, it's stuck. - Let me help you. Henrik, it's stuck, it's not working. Steels, can you help me?

Yes, that's a little bit. Is there a start. I lost track of time. I thought that in a city the size of London, you'll do okay without me to dream big. But now I'm back here.... I want to be a teacher. I thought that the vet! I'll have you stay with us at the hotel? Talk to you tomorrow. I can't leave my dad alone. On the port side, I said. - Soft drinks falls right in. - Let me do it, you have it. Thanks.... Have you arranged for a great hotel. Your parents would be proud of you!!! Pass it on to the port. So, it's going to take a life. Don't you? And your dad is the fastest. Okay, Do not be silent! Take care! What a bad worker! You were a good helper of cook. Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? What do you do? This punk doesn't have what he was looking for the boat! Now, come on, you got that?! These gentlemen would like some refreshment? Then, in the harbor, I saw for the first time.

I can see! What a deal! Who would have thought that you could grow so beautifully in English. Thank you for the compliment. You were different than all the teachers you know. Wilhelm Voigt. - Fisher of the stones, you know. It was like no one would ever be able to touch me not even with a flower. When I was eight years old, I got it and I'm going out to sea. You were a little too small to go after the stone. That's why I'd like to do it again. Take me on a date with you. Maybe in the spring. This year, I'm done. Too bad! In the old days, I could live off of fishing from the rocks. Right now we survive in the transportation of tourists. - This one is for my son. Christian, good to meet you. He enters the final year of high school. Right. I love the "Animal Farm", isn't it? You could write a story of exceptional about it. - Thank you. I hope you work hard for it. We'll see. I can! For a phone call. In London. I'll see you at the celebration of the port? Yes, of course. Fishermen in the drive. It looks good! Yes. The fishermen are in the lead. Now!!! And much more! A round of applause. Hey, Christian! - Daddy... Are you the most proud of? Good luck! Well, congratulations, gentlemen. You did a great job. You come here, you naughty boy! Good luck! Ms. Petersen!

Ladies, it is done. You. take your pick! The ladies are invited. Come on, Christian, you said you would. To dance with me? The promises are carried out. Where is the fellow Kugler? I thought you guys were together. - I've not seen the last Jürgen. This has got to go. After putting the kids to bed. Have you ever met Stine and Mark? - Speed. Very nice. It's not easy when his wife died. Now that you're here. All year long he is to keep us safe from the storms! Only once, at the end of the summer he comes to us from the depths of the sea, in order to choose the mermaid. The Peep-A-Boo! Where's my mermaid? Where is it? Save me, if he wanted to take me out? Reward him for a job well done to him! Where's my mermaid? Good evening, mr. Kugler! Good evening, Christian. I was about to miss the rapture of the siren. Where's my mermaid? Here it is! - Well done!!! Of course they did. I'd rather not get into it. Do not disappoint the people, ms. Petersen! Under the sea with you!!! Put me down right now! Let me go, I tell you! Do you think you're good? Let yourself be touched only by the british? - That's enough. - Let me go. Have you heard what the lady said! Who's the lady? I only see a tomboy! - Go into the water with you!!! - Let me go. Thank You, Christian. End Do! Get yourself a drink and calm down. - To you. you can go home. I - I? Why should I? Music. Christian, I'll leave it at that. I'm so sorry. Do you want to dance, or is it better to go for a walk? Thank you. "Tomboy get" she's going to powder her nose. I'm afraid that next year the sea will be rough. Not my fault. There's something wrong with that? You've ruined the mood of the people. I had to go down to the end of a drunken man? It's just as your guests are laughing at? That. Last year, he threw it at me, and I'm tapped out, can you see? Don't think so. We're not from London, here, you have to go in the game. I'm deciding who to play with. I put it on the camera? If it is, it's just a friend, just tell me what her name was. Colin, don't tell me I'm overreacting. I don't want it to be... Me? - What are you doing in there? - I'm taking the buoys out in the water. You better do it fast! Get out! It's not my fault that you left your window open.... You'll excuse me, I'm yelling at the wrong people. Thank you. If you're coming with me, get down on the fishing rocks. In a week or two, it's the fall the water will be cloudy and the bottom of the sea, never to see each other. For breakfast, you can have it back. For a moment, Christian. Here's the puzzling thing. Attention! The ropes cut into my flesh. When we put the buoys weren't even in the world. I'm coming to help you. Why are you living in a hotel? I've got a few days off at home. Living with my dad, it's not easy. You need to assess your strengths with each other. What are you doing here in Germany? My dad sees it all the worse, and she needs me. Before that, I was out on the water for hours and hours. I was imagining what it would be like to not go back. That was the last one. - Let's go to the rocks. The following needs to be put in the back of the island to the birds. I just hope that the weather will be on us!!!! Of course I knew it wasn't going to be that way. But the desire to be alone with her, had clouded my mind. I'm afraid that the beginning of the storm. We've got to land. From here, you've got to swim. I can't get any closer to the shore, they are too high in the waves. I'm about 50 feet away. About. But there's less water on the land. Hey! - You are the best. - That's right. - We still got wet. He was just comforting her. - Build a fire. For a moment there. ~ Who lives here? The old man's a birdwatcher. But there's still a lot here.... Matthiesen, fisherman, takes care of herself. Clean it up, don't catch a cold! I is a longing for London. Yes, 14 years is a long time. At first, I worked as a nanny in Leeds then I studied in London. - What are your plans for after high school? - I haven't even thought of yet. You can study at home and abroad. Hirtshafen it's not just the navel of the world. I can't go. My father has need of me. You guys are way too serious for your age. Have you read the ancient texts in the holidays, isn't it? Yes, The Christian One. - Tea for two. I've... Attention! Stella. Can you hear me? Stella, can you hear me? You need to take a breath. Hurry! - You have a really good lunch. - Which one do you like? This. In, you know? Each of us gets a piece of it. Do you do tours with the boat? We would be interested in. - In the afternoon tomorrow. I can't -- - Undine's, he went back to the port? Good day to you, sir, Kugler! The home of the sirens it's the water, S. Hello, Stella! Today, eat a fish, sweetheart? Do you want to join us? We'd love it! We've got beer! Thanks for your help, ms. Petersen said. Hold on, I'm comin'! I've watered it a lot! I put in the buoys for the regatta, and we got caught up in it. At eight, would you agree? I have to go back to my dad's Scharmünde. - But, then, maybe, some other time. Yes, we'll be back. That fish of yours! You've missed out on a fun evening with your family, Kugler. Thank you. We'll see each other again? Oh, yeah, tomorrow at school. The time of the third one. That's not what I'm talking about. I know. Good morning to you! Good morning, ladies and gentlemen! Some of you may have known that already. Ms. Petersen is the first and only teacher at the Lessing. he managed, with a little bit of help to get him down the pitch! This means that you'll have, and the last year of high school. Don't make me laugh! I wish you all a good start into the new school year and have fun on the trip! Thank you. Please, please, please! I've been reading the essays on "Animal Farm". Some of them are good. - Georg Bisanz? I - I'm. - In the language of the English, please. "It's me." What's so funny about that? Sorry, but we're just not used to talking in English at the time. As far as I know, this is an English class, so, it may be time to speak to you in English, don't you think? Georg, you're the angle of your. the view is unusual. Life is not black and white. Georg has been looking for reasons for my actions. thank you. Well done!!! - Thank you. I really like it. Will you help me share my books. Of course it is. When I first saw it, I got what I needed. An acknowledgement of the good fortune that had hit me. The incredible feeling that asking for a repetition. You may want to draw a map. Yoknapatawpha is a mixture of fiction and reality. I've seen your legs, I've never once felt the body of the lying next to me, and I îmbrățișasem. I couldn't forget what had happened. I just wanted a confirmation by a gesture or by a look. In the same vicinity, I needed to be alone with my memories. Voigt, what do you do? You're coming with us to the beach? Today, I don't. Stefanie, would you? Are you in need of some tutoring, if you want to make a good impression. You think so? - How's he doing, mrs. Petersen? Ms Petersen Said. She's not married. I'm a little young to be a teacher. Nice, I have to say. I wonder how you can focus on you guys? Thank you, glad you enjoyed it. What is it? After the start of school, I got a chance to talk to him alone. Even on a trip with my class I've got in mind! Once you looked at me that day. The look in your eyes, Stella, I went through the heart. I understand that I need to act on it. You go up? Somewhere where there aren't a lot of people. Where'd you get that? I just borrowed it. Cool, don't you? - There you go. - What is it? - No money for gas. - You can be my guest. Don't be silly. This is just a small contribution. What are you doing, are you crazy? Get it here! What's the 'g Back then, I didn't give it away. It Says "Spaghetti"! Excuse me? Take a look at me. Stella, it's lovely! Wait, wait. No, no, hold it! I just want to get you in the picture. It was a thing of beauty. Once again, the contre-jour! It's super cool. I'm not ready. - Let's do it together. Hey! - How do they do it? That. - Has it already started? - I don't believe that it clicks into place. I don't understand. Why do I have to read something like that? What you want to say, Not to the land of impossible-to-pronounce? Yoknapatawpha. Not it can't be explained in a few words. Try it. What's so special about it? - Do you really want to know? Yes, I want to know everything about you.... In Faulkner, there is no right and wrong, correct or false. The characters can act in no other way, I'm doing everything I can to them, the better. They have their own truth, and so fail we do. I've said it before, but I've been thinking that I love you, Stella. And I've been thinking, and I want to find out more about it. None of what you don't get it when you become aware you are in love with someone else. What are you doing to me? I'm wrapped around your finger. Stella, why did you ignore me at school? - What do you want me to do for you? I don't know. But I was in pain. Good day to you, ms. Petersen! Hello! About an hour of being at the beach has its advantages. Anyone who wants to participate is warmly invited. I was in the middle of the game Well, that's fine. - What do you teach? - Keep your mouth shut. Gee, the sea of love. What a light!!! In London, I don't have it. It was nice of you to come with me!!!! Very, very nice. Next time you go on a boat ride to the rocks in the sea. The two of us. What do you think? That's when I first thought about living with you. It was a thought, bold as brass. I already know that he was born out of the fear of that's what I link you, you might have come to an end. - - - In a day, you'll learn it all. - What for? Christian, aren't we? Just promise me you won't tell anyone. Yes, of course. Frauke Bruns, wanted to book a boat tour for the guests. I've had to learn. The next time you take your car to, ask for permission first. Yeah, sorry about that. And a tank of gas? He's full of it. I put it on layaway at the Nolte's. I'll give you the money on Wednesday. Up for grabs, didn't get anyone anything at all. But sometimes they forget some stuff. a handkerchief, cigarettes and a paperclip. Once you have found the key to the Cabin. N-no one asked for it. Was afraid of being found out. Recently, it has been someone else in there. They may have taken refuge maybe they just wanted the solitude. And you? What is it this time? Anything.... But today, when I got my own things,the I could tell right away that it was someone else in the house. Good luck! What things would you take it? Good morning, mr. Matthiesen! The real me, the stress of the on-board is enough for me. I can't even take care of the island of the birds, unfortunately. This means that you are selling? There was no land to sell, don't you ever forget it. Maybe I'll rent it. For my part, the box can be to keep it the way it is. It can serve as a shelter for one and not the other. Bird island is the kind of love of love as it was, and we used to be. - How much would it cost to rent? - Why are you interested in? It's the only way. We got the fish of the day? Sports! Have you done it already? Yes. How much do you have? An hour ago. - Do you hear me? We are looking for a translator from English to a conference of the fishermen. See if you can guess who he's already chosen the Block and back! Well, why don't you? I invite you to have lunch with them. My dad is waiting for me, so I can't. - How are the kids? - I'm very pleased with it. I have been a substitute teacher in a class of their own. - Georg, he's very talented, isn't it? - Of course. And, Talking About. - I can't say for sure. I believe that the... Why? Please don't take this the wrong way. I think it's reasonable to tutor a student on the beach. I've been playing volleyball on the beach. Christian, Georg, and half of the class. You owe me a coke with my lunch! Please, take a seat. You have done well. The novel is quite complicated, but we are making headway. George, well done!!! Do you like Joe Christmas, isn't it? Normal. This is the most interesting character in the whole novel. The way it is. Joe had seen something I shouldn't have, and he used that to his advantage. But, in the end, he was killed. Hans, why don't you take the word of the hour? You have a lot to say. Steffie, you made me shocked. Very well written, congratulations. Thank you. Karin, what can I say? You can do better than that. I know. - Annemarie, very very good. Christian. Christian. You have to work a little harder. You've worked hard on it. Well done!!! Rudolph, that's an interesting point of view, but I've kind of lost count in the end. With all of this... Yes, That's Christian? - I'm sorry, I didn't understand it. - What is it? Note that I have given it to you. I need to work on your spelling. But you have to get "good enough" just because of the spell? The content is more important than that, isn't it? Take a look here.... Have you confused "when" with "if", you put "life" with "you". All nouns are written with a capital letter. Your interpretation does not include the plan's metaphor of story-telling. Aside from the fact that the novel reflects the the political situation of the 30s in the Southern states. I don't know the fairy tale of a work of fiction, and you tell me, what do you want? It How is that fair?! Open your books, please. Excerpt & correct sub-headings: *** paminotu *** Mr. Kugler... Good day to you, mr. Voigt! I've not been here? - Is it something that happened at your school? Do you know the new English teacher, he's talking about. Stella Petersen? For sure. The son of you, sir. not too much of a focus in the class. It is clear that he has fallen in love with her. From what I hear, it's not the only one. My last year of high school, that's the hard part. I just want to make sure that Christian takes his studies. I don't disagree with you. Good day to you, mr. Petersen! Oj. - I'm A Christian Voigt. The son of a fisherman. It's nice that you're helping your dad. Our generation has been through a lot. I've kind of ruined the view of the war. I'm so sorry. The lady's daughter. it's at home? Is my English teacher. - School is out. I have a question related to my work. My daughter is a teacher a good one? Yes, it's the best. Oh, Christian, what are you doing here? I'm sorry, I just... I have a question related to my work. Come on in! - What are you doing bursting in here like this? I had to see you. Stella that's not nice what you did to me earlier in the class. You're the one saying that? What do you want from me? You have to be careful how you wear it. We can't just show up as two teenagers falling in love. But I have to get up in front of the whole class? Do you know what does that mean for me? For you, too. Just another day at school, and I'm doing my job. Don't take it that way, it is possible to make all of them. I've thought about it. In the future, we may meet on the island. Is it just us, protect us. - What are you talking about? I can. We're going to be very, very careful, and we'll go from there, just when no one's looking. You're tight. - Why not? I will be your teacher for life. When I take the sat, you don't have to worry about that anymore. I can! Yes? Stella. I understand what's going on here? Excuse me? Why is this guy here? "Stella, love, Colin?" Since when do you smoke? So there it is, Colin. Petersen. Henrik? I can't believe it! What do you do? Yes, thank you. When you? At the weekend, that's fine. I'll ask Frauke, right? I'll see you then, bye-bye. One of my friends. They took me out for a ride on the boat. Nice. For me it would be good to get away from all this. It was very surprising to me, Christian. When can I see you again? You have to see for myself. Go for it now. Great! I've never seen anything like it. It was a wonderful thing. Where did you get it? When I was a child, we are diving for the coins. It was a game. - Who was the one he was making a wish.... And what do you want? You have to think about it. But you don't have to wait that long. It is useful at any time you have an itch in my pocket. - Your skin, your smile. - How come? That's what I was reading. In some cases, the skin may be smiling. It's your smile. Why? Stella. Stella. What's wrong with it? She was just fine. I parked my car at the hotel. Have you been waiting up all night? As soon as they arrive, the participants of the conference. Today, you start early. That's right, the marine biologists. The Block I was asked to be the lead singer. Nice. I almost didn't see each other anymore. You have a lot of work? It's hard to set up a classroom of kids. And my dad's getting more and more difficult. Do you know what I'm talking about you, Stella. I understand what you are doing? I've you're a student. - More than three-quarters of a year to finish. - Wait until then. I know that you're trying to be nice. You make up your own mind on who you're playing. You are ruining both of our lives. Do you know what people are like on here. You can always go back to England. I can't go back, and I don't even want it! This means that you have done to Me? Christian, what is it? A back-up? Don't you ever wished you could have someone else after you listen to me I wish that each and every day. You have in mind? Come for a drive with the boat? I've missed you. Hey, Christian! Yes? - I'm going out. Do you need anything? No, thank you. You are in love. It is seen. It's too painful. Just leave it be. The holiday has passed. The school is now your job. I'll see what I can do. Now you're going to get some rest. Still, there's something to fix on the boat. I'm late one more time in the shed. - Do it is coming very soon to the port. Yes? If you go in the morning on the boat, someone is going to see it at any time. Let him speak his piece. The world, however you don't listen to him. Yeah, I mean, they have eyes. , Mr Kugler and he was on to me. - How come? I was a young Christian. But the world doesn't need to know what you're doing. It is in the hay a lot of the city. Do you have one? Christian. No, no, thank you. For a moment, are you a delegate? - I don't. I just wanted to-- - you can't get in. Mr. Voigt, you've finally made it. Yes, Ms. Petersen. It is the referrer for me. Let it go, please, to go. - Doesn't pass. - But I do. You asked me what I wanted to do later on. I'm thinking of studying marine biology. It is the college of education at Kiel. - This is me with the "you". I can! Miss Stella Petersen, who is our new lead singer. Nice. Is a degree in English literature. - Of English literature. What has this got to do with fishing, my dear young lady? It helps to know how to read it. "Moby-Dick", for example. I've heard that the fishermen of the germans are worried about the population of garden eels. Yes, it is a priority for us. And who is this young man? - I'm sorry. Christian Voigt. I - I'm fine, wouldn't you say? Christian, I was a student. Great luck to you! My teachers were so nice. Don't you? Christian wants to study marine biology in Kiel. He is the son of a fisherman. Lonegan, a good day. Interesting. What do fish see? Excuse me? - What do the fish see? They ask you what you're fishing for. I understand that. Of the stones. We fish the rocks. Good one! The boy is fishing the rocks. The famous English humor, don't you? - Do you speak excellent English. - Thank you. Where did you do your graduate work? To. So, are you a fisherman by the rocks. There are rocks at the bottom of the sea? I thought I had emptied all of them. And here you are. I'm so hungry! Dad, I think I'd like the future to be paid for what I do. It's in the news? - What do you want the money for? I just spoke with the Matthiesen. I don't know the cottage on the island of the birds. - What do you want me to do with it? - Turn it up and move on it. - I can't live there. - Why don't you? I like it. - Do the math with the money. - Thank you. If you're asking for money for your hard work well, then, I want you to pay your room and board while living there. Well, I can't do it. Jutta! It has been great. Thank you, I'm lost without you. For me it has been a pleasure. If you stop by London, give us a call. - Of course. - Maybe I can learn a bit of German. , Good - bye. Good-bye! - Have a nice trip! Good-bye! Would you like to go out with her? What kind of question is that? Let's travel to a conference in another in the world outside of the small port of the fishermen? This was a refreshing change of pace. You don't have to go. The so-called experts-no, but I've heard the fishing is from the rocks. Could you be a dear and let them figure it out. I felt like I was a nobody. You don't have to. No I don't believe it. You're leaving tomorrow, aren't you? First thing in the morning. You need to pack a bag. We're heading to Denmark. - Are you coming back? - Of course, I'll be back for you, Christian. It seemed to me that something needs to be said at the end, in light of what we have planned for the future. I failed to mention that, wanting to avoid having to say anything definitively. Put them down on the bedside table, and he acts like it's normal. - You should have seen the look on his... - Any of the tânărń like to look up to. Especially when the teacher is so nice. If it's just admiration... I have nothing to do with the admiration. But to the Christian it is more than that. - Is 18 years of age. Yes, and it's a lot older than you. What's wrong with her? It is the teacher's. Sometimes, it happens that way. You can't say no, and I don't know what happened to it. Dear Stella, I just can't wait to go back! Mind you, I've had the cottage ornithologist! Till we meet next time, I'll set up everything by the book. I've got a little extra rations. Repair the roof and increase terrace, if you want to. Maybe we can learn to live together. I miss you so much, Stella. Since you've been gone, I count every single hour, every single minute of it. Just one minute to do it while the rest of eternity. I'm sorry, you can't get in. Good morning to you! I've got some good news from the hospital. Ms. Petersen, I don't feel amazing, but it's a little bit better. At three o'clock, there will be a visit from a small delegation from your school. Dear miss Petersen, I just came here to wish you the best of wishes for a speedy recovery. We are glad that you are feeling better. We know that you like fruit, candy, so I thought I'd bring a couple to enjoy with them. On the part of the teachers. Get well soon to you, Stella! Are you going to the show in the Morning? Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme... It reminds me of the one who lives there. It was the love of my life... Tell her to weave a shirt for you. Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme... With no seams and no stitches. Then you'll be a true love of my life. You'll have to leave you now to rest. He is still very weak and must be coddled. If ms. Petersen agreed, we will keep you up to date with the status of the well. Let's go! Mr. Kugler, good-bye. - Good-bye. Christian. Yes. If I'm not mistaken, you are personally affected by the accident to her. But, you have to proceed with caution, Christian. When ms. Petersen said she would come back, it would be a shame you'll be expelled just before graduation. Do you understand? Well. What are you doing here? Don't get around to it on here.... If you do not want tough shame. My mom says you saved my life, Stella. You don't have to get out of bed? Here's what I've found. Down on the beach. Hang the seaweed is broken. That's nice. Sorry it took so long. That's right. Wait. A mosquito bite. It looks like it's alive, isn't it? - Do you see? There's something else. That's right. It was a cockroach. The two haven't been paying attention. They were sitting on a tree when you tear out of the resin under the bark and on the inside. In the midst of life. But now that they are together forever and ever. - There you go. - I'll give it to you. Really? My mom has a locket like that. I'm sure you'll like it, and Stella. - Do you love? - Why do you ask? If you're in love, it's going to get good grades. I'll take it. I think you are right. Christian, Son are you? Her mother was looking all over the place. I'm never going back. Stella. Stella. Stella, I can't hear you. Stella. Excuse me, are you ms. Petersen? I'm so sorry. It can't be! Yesterday, it was still there. Anything I can do for you. My daughter has just died. I need to figure something out. It was one of her things. You need to take care of the burial at sea. For The Christian Up to you, if you please. Dear members of the college staff, fellow students,... Before I could say a few words about our dear Stella Petersen I would like to ask all of you let's have a moment of silence because of this great man, who was no longer with us. I looked at the picture. And, at the time, I was imagining how you would react to the silence that is imposed, for me, I just thought of something else. It was a memory so vivid, that I couldn't ignore it. I've seen the imprint of our bodies on the sand of the island's birds,the the area descoperiserăm for all of us and we shared. I understand that I can't reveal this revelation because of the was going to end. something that meant the world to me. How many more years do you have? How do I know? 72? I'm serious. Usually, you're 25 years old, but at school, you look a lot bigger. What is it? Now what? I'll give it to you. Make-a-wish. You've got to want something. I just did it. For The Christian "Love you, Christian, that there is a sea of warmth." Maybe my wish was fulfilled, already, Stella. At the same time that it was yours. The past can't be changed. You have to live with it. Along with the pain and fear of the natural, I'll try and find out what it is forever lost.
