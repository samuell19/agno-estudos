Hey, Gracie. I'm so glad we caught you before you left. Look at these samples. Organic pacifiers. Oh, fabulous. I can see Luna loves hers. I stopped at the bank yesterday to put in my half of the investment money. Excellent. I will have my dad transfer in my half. I can't believe we're doing this. Uh, I can. We've only been talking about starting our own business together since we were, like, eight. Yeah. But I want everything to go smoothly. Remember when we cut our price on Kool-Aid and put Amy Klein's lemonade stand out of business? This is us. It's going to be flawless. Yeah, but we only have one product. Is that enough? Baby steps. Oh, my gosh, "Baby Steps." That's got to be the name of our company. You're right, that's perfect. Oh. Okay. Which one do you like better? This? Or... Both. Yeah? I agree. Hawaii, here I come. Cold snow and ice, here we come. You know, you could all stay for free at the resort with me and my dad. I know. But I promised Chris that we'd spend the holidays at his parents' house. Plus, this tiny lady has a first date with a snowman. Oh, you are going to melt that snowman's heart, aren't you? Molly, town car's here. Oh, I gotta go. - Okay, bye. - Talk to you soon. Bye. Coming. Daddy, where are your bags? Uh, change in plans. What's going on? Look, I have some bad news, baby. Gallant Resorts is going under. Under where? What are you talking about? The recent drop in hotel occupancy has forced our corporation into bankruptcy. I'm the head of marketing. How could I not know about this? Well, I'm meeting with the board of directors next week. Wait a minute. Am... Am I out of a job? No, no, no. I hope not. Well, at least Gracie and I have out investment money and are ready to go. Yeah, about that. What? What? What? Isn't this what you always wanted, for me to go off and create my own business, just like you did, and use my marketing skills? Yes, of course. Where's my investment money? Gracie is counting on me. What am I supposed to do? Look, it's not ideal, but I think I know of a way for you to get your money back. How, sell my kidneys? Not yet. Remember the house that your mother grew up in? The one in Spearmint Valley? Peppermint Hollow. Who makes up these names? We went there a few times when you were still little, before your mother passed away. Yes, I remember. She used to take me riding on chocolate chip. Yes, exactly. Your name is on the deed, Molly. So go. Sell it. You can use the money for your business. My assistant switched your flights. She's told the tenants you're coming, and she made an appointment with the real estate agent in town. Now, if you leave now, you can just make it. What about Hawaii? Ugh. - Oh, hi. - Oh. What can I get for you? Uh, anything warm with caffeine. Ooh. How about a Peppermint Hollow mocha? It's our specialty. Do you have anything without mint? You don't like mint? - Well... - Are you allergic to mint? No. So, you just don't like mint. A latte with no foam. You want that with mint? - I'm just teasing you. - Funny. That'll be 3.99. - Uh, keep the change. - Oh, thank you, hon. First time in Peppermint Hollow? Uh, no, it's just been a while. Well, Christmas is the best time of year to be here. I'll bet it is. And so is Hawaii, which is where I'll be for the holiday. Oh, I hear it's beautiful there. You've never been? I've never been out of Peppermint Hollow. - Never? - Nope. - Here you go. - Thank you. And here's a mint brownie bite on the house. No, thanks. Well, Merry Christmas. It will be. She'll be back. Excuse you. Excuse me? Excuse you. I just saved your life. By pushing me? I just took a snowball to the head for you. What snowball? Exactly. You owe me an apology. I think you owe me an apology. You were a half second away from eating a faceful of coffee. Because of you. Let's just agree to disagree. I'm Noah. - Molly. - Nice to meet you. - Let me buy you another coffee. - Oh, no, I have to run. You sure? Yeah. Obviously the universe is telling me to cut back on caffeine. Or it's telling you to switch to decaf. Merry Christmas. They're all so cheery here. Hi, Patrick. Uh, this is Molly Gallant. I had an appointment at 11:00-ish. Uh, I have a property I'd like to sell right away, so if you could just give me a call back and let me know when we could meet. Thanks. Hi. Molly again. Uh, your sign said, "Be back soon." "Soon" like a few minutes, hours, days? Just curious, because as I mentioned before, I'm in a bit of a rush. Thank you. Oh, my gosh. Wow. - Hi. - Hi. Are your parents here by any chance? Oh, they died when I was a baby. Who is it, Dakota? Oh. Come to apologize? Not quite. Uncle Noah, do you know her? I, uh, saved her life back in town. No, he didn't. Uh, what are you doing here? I live here. What are you doing here? Uh, well, I was just passing through, and I thought, "Why not take a tour?" We don't give tours. Not even for the owners? The Gallants own our property. Molly Gallant, property owner. Oh, my gosh. Molly. I haven't seen you since you were knee-high to a grasshopper. Your dad's office called this morning, said somebody would be stopping by. I had no idea it was gonna be you. Oh, you probably don't even remember me. - Oh. - Mmm. I'm Kim. I'm an old friend of your mom's. And my goodness, look at you. You're all grown up. And you... You are just a spitting image of Sarah. You knew my mom? Oh, we grew up together. I was... I was just gutted when I heard she passed. Oh, my Lord, you must be freezing. You look like you're dressed for Hawaii. Oh, I'm headed there after this. Oh, you're serious? How about that tour? Let me get you some boots. Oh, no, thanks. I'm good. Suit yourself. Be careful on those steps. I'll just grab my jacket, and I'll show you the family business. Oh. Wow. You okay? You knew that was gonna happen. I most certainly did not. Let's agree to disagree. I'm fine. Here it is. What is that? - It's mint. - Of course it is. It's not what I imagined. It looks like a science lab in here, but at least it's warm. Well, greenhouses tend to be about 30 degrees warmer than the outside temperature. I wish I were 30 degrees warmer than the outside temperature. You get used to the cold. I could never get used to the cold. 70 degrees and sunny is more my style. This mint smells so minty. Well, when you smell mint, your brain releases mood-determining hormones into the body. It's a natural relaxer. I don't need mint to feel relaxed. Clearly. Listen, um, I actually... Grandma's making dinner, and she wants you to stay. Thank you. Uh, I'm just gonna grab a bite in town. Oh, no, you're gonna want to stay. She makes the best mashed potatoes you'll ever eat. Oh, I'm not big on carbs. She made apple pie for dessert. I'm cutting down on sugar. Oh, come on. We'll round up kale and water. It'll be great. So... you said that you and my mom grew up together. - We sure did. - Were you good friends? Well, not right away. We both liked the same boy. Oh, yeah? But then it turned out he was interested in another girl all along. His loss. Turned out for the best, really. If it weren't for him, I don't think Sarah and I would have become such good friends. So, how did you wind up living here? When Sarah went off to school in California, she wanted somebody she knew to take care of the place. I don't think she ever really wanted to sell. So, when my late husband and I decided to expand our mint business, she convinced us to move in here, and it's been our home ever since. What exactly do you do in Los Angeles? Uh, well, I'm going into a partnership with my best friend, Gracie. We're developing a line of organic baby products. But my day job is Director of Marketing for Gallant Resorts. - Oh. - Huh. What does that mean? What exactly do you do? Uh, we sell the experience. So, I like to break it down into four categories, research, awareness, promotion, and my favorite, relationships. I get to meet people from all over the world. Any celebrities? - A few. - Who? Well, I'm not supposed to say, but Leonardo DiCaprio visited our Oahu property last Christmas. No way. Really? Kissed me on the cheek. You are so lucky. So, what is there to do in Spearmint... Peppermint Hollow? Well, we host our annual Winters Mint Christmas Eve party every year. It's a potluck. Come one, come all. Fun. And Gran makes her famous Christmas cookies, and we dance and we sing. All the fixings for a magical winter's eve. So, Molly, you said something about Hawaii. Uh, yes, my... my dad and I spend Christmas there together. It's our tradition. Why did you come all the way from Los Angeles for a tour? It's not really on the way. Excellent question. I, um... I hadn't been here in a while, so I thought, "Why not visit? Get a tour. Get back to my roots." Uh, I mean, well, my dad wanted me to check it out, so here I am checking it out. And everything looks good, so I will tell him that when I see him in Hawaii. Speaking of checking out, uh, do you have any hotel recommendations? Oh, nonsense. You're gonna stay here with us. Oh, no. I don't wanna impose. Honey, look outside. I don't think you could go anywhere tonight. I know it's not much, but hopefully this will do. No, it's perfect. Thank you. Oh, my pleasure. Did you know this was your mom's room, growing up? - Really? - Yeah. I mean, I know it's a little faded, but I think you can still see it. Here. Take a look. Wow. Well, if you need anything, anything at all, - just let me know, all right? - Yes, I will. Thank you. - Sleep well. Nighty-night. - Goodnight. Do you really think she came all this way just for a tour? I don't know what brought her here. But she's dressed for a luau, and it gets cold upstairs, so why don't you go bring her another blanket? Fine. But I think we both know why she's here. Well, it's freezing and the town's tiny, but the people who live here are really nice, and one of them was friends with Mom. Oh, Kim, that's right. How's the turndown service? Did you get a mint on your pillow? There's mint everywhere, except my pillow. This whole town smells like mouthwash. Well, you'll be on a plane soon. Just remember, you're there for one purpose and one purpose only. I know. How was the meeting with the real estate agent? Well, I was there at 11:00-ish and he wasn't, so I'm waiting to hear back. But I was thinking, I could offer to sell it to them. You know, this isn't just their home, it's their livelihood. That would be the easiest route, but I don't think they can buy it. Why not? Honey, they're behind on their rent. I've been floating them for months now. I gave them till the end of the year to pay it back, but the fact is, I don't think they can afford to live there anymore. Way to raise the stakes, Dad. Uh, I gotta go. I'll talk to you soon. Love you. Come in. Oh. Sorry to interrupt. I just brought you up another blanket. To keep you warm. You know, because it's cold outside and inside. - Thanks. - Yeah. Well, have a great, um... really nice, you know, good dreams... comfortable kind of sleep. Yeah. I hope you have a good, uh, nice, good dreams comfortable kind of sleep, too. Yeah. Goodnight. Goodnight, Noah. - Oh. - Goodnight. Oh. Good morning! Sun's up. Everybody up. Up and at 'em. Hey! - Mmm. Bacon. - Stop it! Morning. Since when do you drink coffee? Since today. I just felt like it. Uh-huh. How many sugars? Six-ish. - Stop eating already. - Okay. It was quite a storm last night. I'm gonna go out and check the greenhouse, make sure everything's secured. I'll be right back. Do you need help with anything, Gran? Oh, no, thanks, hon. Why don't you go help your Uncle Noah? Oh, grab me a handful of mint, okay? I'm gonna start on my next batch of Winters Bliss. You got it. And don't be long, okay? We are eating very shortly. Uncle Noah, wait up! Oh, hello, sunshine. You get up early around here. Oh, this is sleeping in for us. It's 6:30. We eat late on Saturdays. No kidding. How did you sleep? Really well. Foghorn Leghorn didn't wake you? - Hmm? - He's our rooster. Never missed a sunrise. He's our surefire alarm system. Uh, yes, the bird. Yeah, he, he woke me. Well, you get used to him. Do you need any help? Actually, could you keep an eye on these pancakes? I'm gonna go out and get Dakota and Noah, and then we are just about ready to eat. Oh, cooking's not really my forte. Oh, you'll be fine. Just flip them over when they start to bubble. No, really. I can't cook to save my life. You'll be fine. I have faith in you. Hmm. Anyone else? You had one job. Well, I've... ...got to get going. But thank you so much for letting me stay. Oh, our pleasure. Your mother, bless her soul, would have done the same thing for us. Well, you have a lovely family. - Can I help you with your luggage? - No, thanks. I'm good. Um, be careful on the steps out there. Okay. Where are my keys? You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Thank you so much. Yeah. Thanks. Bye! My keys! No, no, no. Keys, come on. Aloha. How was Hawaii? I can't find my keys. Oh. Is that funny to you? It's a little funny. Well, I need to get to town. I'm late. I have a very important errand I need to run. Like getting a new car key? I'll tell you what, I am, uh, running into town to grab some supplies. Why don't you come with? And when we get back, - I'll help you find your keys. - Okay. Let's, uh, get you out of your Barbie shoes. "Let's get you out of your Barbie shoes." Just one step at a time. You got it. There you go. All right. Okay. I have to sell. I just have to tell him. He's eventually gonna find out. But I should wait till I talk to the real estate agent. Yeah, that's good. Right? Okay, thanks so much for your help, Gracie. Call me back when you can. Bye. I think that's good. - What? - I think you got it. What? Never mind. Oh. Hey, uh... thanks for not evicting us yet. I assume that's why you're here. - Oh. - I... I promise I'm good for it. All right? I got it covered. I know I can figure it out. Plus, it's Christmas, right? The season of miracles. Yeah. Yeah. "Season of miracles." Wow. You guys take Christmas really seriously here. Well, is there any other way to take it? In Hawaii. Hey, Noah. Oh, hey, Chloe. How are you doing? Can't complain. Please thank your mom for the Winter Bliss. Daddy and the baby are so grateful. What's Winter Bliss? Well, every Christmas, my mom makes this mint-lavender blend to hand out to her friends in town. What does it do? - It helps calm babies down. - Oh. I mean, everybody swears by it. Does it work for adults? No. Who's this? I'm Molly. She's my landlord. She owns the farm. You don't look like a farmer. I'm Chloe. Noah and I go way back. We do. High-school sweethearts. It was a really long time ago. Aren't you freezing? No, I am fine. I'm just gonna go run an errand. I will meet you back at the truck in 30 minutes. - Okay. - Nice meeting you. Mmm. She's charming. Be nice. I am. She seems sweet. Obviously not from around here. And your point? Didn't think someone like that would be your type. I didn't know I had a type. And there's the problem. She's just my landlord. She's leaving tomorrow. Of course she is. All right. I'll see you, Chloe. Yeah, bye. - So, you want to sell? - Yes. I'm in a bit of a rush, though. I'm flying out of town tomorrow, and I'm just here to start the process, hire an agent, get an appraisal. Well, why don't you tell me about the property? Uh, apparently, I own a mint farm up the road. The Winters' property? - Exactly. - Mmm. Yeah, they throw a hell of a holiday party there every year. I hear it's a hoot. So, to be honest, they don't know about this yet, so I'd really appreciate it if we could keep it that way for now. Certainly. Well, great. Why don't I get started on the comps for you. Great. Do you know of a hotel I could stay at tonight? What's wrong? Winters' Bed and Breakfast not good enough for you? I don't wanna overstay my welcome. You can stay with us. It's not a problem. I appreciate the hospitality. What time do you wake up on Sundays? - Hello. - Gracie. I feel terrible, but I promise I will get the money. It's not your fault. One way or another, we're gonna get this business going. At least you're in Hawaii. - Not quite. - What... Gracie? Hello? Gracie, can you hear me? Gracie? I'm here. Can you hear me? I can hear you. Oh. Can you hear me now? Are you hiking a volcano? I'm in Peppermint Hollow. Come again? And I am freezing. I'm at my mom's childhood home in the middle of Timbuktu, Washington. Apparently, she left it to me when she passed away. And if I can just sell it, I can get my half of the investment money back. That's amazing. Do that. Yeah, I'm trying. It's not so easy. I... I met with the real estate agent this morning, and... Hello? Wait. Sorry, I'm losing you. Molly? Oh, gosh. She won't stop crying. I can't hear you. Hello? Hello? Hello. Okay. Oh, food. Food. You're hungry. I'm a great mom. Oh! Gra... There's no place like Hawaii, there's no place like Hawaii. There's no place like Hawaii. Worth a shot. One more day. What? What? No, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no! Oh, my gosh! Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. My flight's canceled, and I'm drowning in snow. But, look what I found. Are you warm enough? Do you want me to start the fire? Judging by your shivers, I'm gonna go with a "Yes." How did you do that? Oh, Uncle Noah connected the fireplace to an app on my phone. He went to MIT, so he's pretty smart. Well, let me know when he figures how to fly a plane through a blizzard, and then I'll be impressed. Got it. Uh... is there anything else I can do for you? Could you get me a private jet to Hawaii? I don't think my piggybank has enough change for that. Good luck. How about some peppermint cocoa to warm you up? Can I get a Mai Tai with an extra shot of rum? - Oh, honey. - I'm sorry. Fix this. - How you doin'? - Never better. That's the spirit. Well, since you're stuck here, you might as well learn about mint farming. I have always wanted to learn about mint farming. - Really? - No. Well, now's the time. - Come on, let's go. - Ugh! Grab a stem. I mean, don't you have machines for that? No. No machine can beat the satisfaction you get by doing something by hand. Says the MIT grad. Huh. You know my secret. I didn't know it was one. Why don't you try it? It's nature's toothbrush. I'm good. Oh, are you... - Are you okay? - Sorry. Ugh! It's not poisonous. You gotta chew it to get the flavor. Just... pretend it's kale. - Huh? - Hmm. - Not bad. Mmm-hmm. - Told you. Here. - Why don't you give it a shot? - No, I'm good. Right. Not the type to get your hands dirty. Ah, you don't know what type I am. Hand them over. Cut the whole plant, just above the first or second set of leaves. Like that. Oh, well, you don't actually want me to do that, do you? Ah, you'll be fine. That's what your mom said about the pancakes. So, I mean, I cut... I cut above the first leaf or the second... I'm not good with manual labor! Okay, okay. Here. You hold the basket - I'll get the mint. - Oh, okay. Mint can be used for gums, oils, lotions, soaps. Mint can pretty much be used for anything. So, how long have you been growing mint? When we were in elementary school, my dad gave my brother and me a small greenhouse and some pots - And the Winters Mint Company was born. - Hmm. Were you and your brother close? We were. He and my sister-in-law were in an accident. Passed away shortly after Dakota was born. I'm so sorry. Yeah. Life goes on. I've been taking care of Dakota ever since. And your mom? Mmm, I take care of her, too. Uh, no, I mean she helps out, too, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, we all need some help now and then. Yeah. Oh, this is a good one here. Let's get this one here. When was the last time you were in Peppermint Hollow? I think I was five or six. Why haven't you been back? Uh, I don't know. It was my mom's house, and... when she passed, we didn't have any more family here. So, no reason to come back. So, we didn't. MIT, huh? That's a long way from Peppermint Hollow. I went there to study environmental engineering. I wanted to see what else was out there. Beyond the peppermint capital of the world? My plan was to incorporate the hydroponic procedures, and, uh, implement a new reusable water supply. - And? - It worked great at first. So, we decided to invest a bit more, which would allow us to... - triple our output. - Mmm. But, by the time the mint was ready to harvest, our biggest buyer went out of business. Bad luck. Bad timing. So, you spent more than you had. And you haven't been able to sell off the extra mint since. Exactly. Don't worry. You'll get your rent. You don't need any help, do you? - Uh, no. I'm done. - Perfect. Gran says it's probably gonna be a whole nother day before the snowplows can clear the pass. Oh. Looks like I'm stuck here a bit longer. I could really use a mani-pedi. But I am guessing that the Winters Bed and Breakfast doesn't have a spa. No. I am behind on my Christmas shopping. Uncle Noah was gonna take me into town. - Would you wanna join? - You had me at "shopping." Great! Let's go! Ah, nothing like shopping at Christmas time. Packed stores, line out to the parking lot. Kids excited to meet Santa. While hungry, tired and having a meltdown. Buying cute little Holiday gifts. - And all the Christmas music. - And all the Christmas music. - Have you ever been married? - Uh, no. - You? - No. But... seriously, I mean, you're gorgeous, and you seem mostly nice. - "Mostly"? Thanks. - Well, I... You must have a boyfriend back home. - I don't. - Really? Someone as gorgeous and mostly nice as you? Yeah, how is it possible? Uh, because, men are only interested in women who are smart and successful. And then they break up with you, 'cause you're smart and successful. Have you tried girls? On that note, I'm gonna go get some adult beverages. - You girls have fun. Text me when you're done. - Mmm-hmm. Finally! I knew that would get rid of him. Now I just have to think about what to get him. - Hey, what about you? - What about me? Any boys in your world? Uh, no... Well, there's Parker. But, I don't even think he knows I exist. Oh, I'll bet he does. Is he going to your party? - Well, he's invited. But... - What're you gonna wear? Oh, I haven't really thought about it much. Uh-huh. Okay, I don't have a dress. Like, I have dresses, but I don't have the right dress. Well, let's find you the right dress. - Are you serious? - When it comes to shopping, I'm always serious. Come on. - Hi, Chloe. - Hey, Dakota. - Molly. - Right. You're still here. Decided to take up farming? Uh, not quite. Dakota and I are just doing a little shopping. So, what're you still doing in Peppermint Hollow? - Noah told me you were leaving. - Change of plans. Oh, yeah? What happened? My flight got canceled. Bummer. For you. Uh, come on. Let's go find you that dress. Don't worry about Chloe. She dated my Uncle all though high school, and she still thinks they're gonna get married. But, it's not gonna happen. - How do you know? - Trust me, she's not his type. What is his type? Someone like... Dakota? What? Oh, my gosh! This is perfect! Try it. - Dakota, it's stunning. - You think? I know. And I know fashion. Trust me. There's no way Parker won't notice you. And just remember, it's the heart of the girl wearing the dress that makes it so beautiful. Thank you. - Nice purse. - Thanks. - Is that... - Gucci. Yeah. Uh, we're ready to check out. Cash or credit? Uh, oh... uh, this is way more expensive than I realized. - I don't have enough. - Hey. My treat. I can't let you do that. You totally can. Her purse costs more than my car. But I'll stay out of it. - I wanna buy it for you. - Are you sure? Yes. You are the best. Super sad about your flight being canceled. I just know it's the holidays, and I'm sure you wanna be with your family. Can you just swipe my card? Let me try again. It's still declined. Uh, here. Try this one. Declined. If you ever wanna sell that purse, I could cut you a fetch deal. No. Not for sale. Hashtag sad. Wait, I just remembered. Um... I forgot I have a dress at home that Gran has been begging me to wear. She would throw a fit if I bought something else. - Are you sure? - Yeah, definitely. And I figured out what I wanna get Gran and Uncle Noah. - So, let's go. - Okay. You go on ahead. I'm gonna make a phone call. - I'll be right there. - Okay. What can I get for these? Valentino? The dress? No, but the coat's on sale. Daddy? Uh, what's going on? My credit cards aren't working. SOS! Hi, honey. Look, I can't talk right now. Wait, Dad. What am I supposed to do? Don't panic. All right? I'm taking care of things. I'm still working on it. Gee, okay. Just tell me the truth. Are we broke? Slightly. - "Slightly"? - Look, honey. I can't talk right now. - All right? - Wait. Daddy. I'm not gonna be able to get to Hawaii. - Next year for sure. - Hello? I love you. There you are. Thought you might like a cookie. It's still warm. Oh, watch out! Whoa! I'm okay. It was either you or the cookies. It's mint chocolate chip. These kids have terrible aim. Hey, Patrick. Uh, checking in on the appraisal. I'd love to get the property listed, ASAP. Please give me a call. - Oh, hi. - I brought you some hot cocoa. Thank you. May I talk to you for a minute? Sure. I actually wanna talk, too. Um... - This is tricky... - I know. I know. We are late on our rent. And up until three months ago, we had never been late with a payment. Noah has always seen to that. Got it. Of course. Uh, and I believe you. We really appreciate your... your trust and understanding. And we're gonna make this right, no matter what it takes. I promise. That's what you wanted to talk to me about, right? Actually, what I wanted to talk to you about was... You really are the spitting image of your mother. I'm sorry. What were you gonna say? I've had four of these today and I know it's not gonna be the last. Oh! Okay. Uh, well, I'll... Let me know if there is something that you wanna talk to me about. I will do that. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, what's right here? Looks like you really put your engineering degree to good use. I was an environmental engineer, not electrical. Could have fooled me. My brother started this tradition. He built a single archway, and when I got home from college, I added to it. We bring it out every Christmas. As you can see, I went a little overboard. Well, I don't hate it. So, does it snow much in Hawaii? Oh, yeah. All the time. No, um... When my Mom passed, my Dad and I started going every year. And instead of a Christmas tree in the living room, we decorate a giant one in the hotel lobby. Luaus on the beach. Christmas carols on the ukulele. We celebrate with our coworkers and guests. - Sounds amazing. - Yeah. Yeah, it's actually really special. And my Dad always goes out of his way to make sure that it is. - He sounds like a great guy. - Mmm-hmmm. The important thing is that you two get to spend Christmas together. Right. Christmas. That's all that really matters. Yeah. Here. Let me show you something. Looking pretty good over there. Thanks. I learned from the best. Oh, and I sold a few more lip balms this week, so, pretty soon, I'll be able to pitch in and help with the rent. You don't have to worry about that. We'll be fine. Where did Noah and Molly go? I think they went for a walk. I think he likes her. I think you're right. The mint. You know, it's growing on me. I can feel it in my bones. There's nothing like it. I feel like I've been in here before. Ah, it used to be the old horse barn. Yeah, I remember that my mom used to take me riding. Her horse was new. Chocolate Chip! Yeah. We, uh, got it a few years back when we were cleaning. I figured it deserved a place on the wall. What is this place now? Well, it's where we dry and store our mint. And because you're a brilliant engineer and you've tripled your output, you've got a lot of it. Yeah. But... not enough buyers. Hence, the tardiness on the rent. Well, what if I could help you? Uh... You're the mint expert, but... I am pretty good at convincing people to buy things. So modest. - Have you ever sold mint? - That's not the point. Let me ask you something. After you sell the mint, what happens to it? Well, we sell it wholesale, then the people we sell it to turn it into other products. Like what your mom does with the Winter Bliss? Nah, that's different. It's not a business. It's just something she does to help people. Well, why can't it be both? What do you have in mind? Well, perhaps... we could work together closely to... Huh... I like where this is going. ...to... that... that thing that I do for a living. - Marketing? - Yeah. Uh-huh. Marketing. Yeah, go on. Well, I've done my research. You have? And I am much more aware of the ins and outs of the mint process. You are, huh? And the next step is permission. When is the part about the relationships coming in? Um... maybe I should think that one through a bit more. So... you think, we should... Probably get back to the house. Right. Yeah, the house. Right. After you. Okay. Okay. You think we should? I think "you" should. - Okay, so, you're gonna ask her. - Really? - Ask her now. - Hi. - Hey. - Ask her. Ask me what? I was... We were wondering, since you're, you know, still kinda stuck here, if you wanted to come with us to pick out a Christmas Tree. I've never picked out a Christmas Tree before. - You've never picked out a Christmas Tree? - Nope. - Are you Jewish? - No. Uh, no. They were just always picked out for me. And all about three stories high and centered in the lobby of my Dad's hotels. You're picking out the tree. - I'm picking out the tree? - Mmm-hmm. She's picking out the tree. I am picking out the tree. Look, she is really taking to her. Yeah, I noticed that, too. She's really starting to adjust. I'm talking about Dakota. Yeah. Yeah... No, me too. Dakota. Yeah. You should ask for her number. - I have Dakota's number. - Oh, that's funny. Mom, she lives in California. All right? She is just here to collect the rent. - That's all. - Really? Then why is she out Christmas tree shopping with you and your family, instead of plotting her escape? I'm just asking. Uh, this one? - Hmm... no. - Okay. Or this one? Hmm... no Get it. This one's a good one. - This one. - Perfect. Oh! - Great! Huh? - Yeah, good! - Oh, do you wanna come with me to go buy an ornament? - Sure. - Do you need some money, honey? - Nope. That's okay, Gran. I got money from my lip balm business. - You have a lip balm business? - Yeah. - Tell me more. - How much is it? It's super fun and my friends can't get enough. Try it. This is quality stuff. And very minty. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, you know, you should put your name on that. And like a mint leaf on top, maybe? Who's the marketing expert now? How about this? All right. Which ornament gets to make it home with us this year? - What do you think? - Oh, it's a classic. - I like it. - I approve. - Let's get home and decorate the Christmas tree, huh? - Wait, guys. Selfie. I got this. Say peppermint. - Peppermint. - Ah. - All right. - Oh, look at that. That's cute. - Thank you. - Okay. What's this? Oh. I thought you were doing it. I thought you were doing it. Okay, we're doing this. Okay. So good. Okay. Um... Uncle Noah. I think it's time. - Is it time? - Oh, it's definitely time.

You wanna do the honors? Um... How about Molly this year. Aw! - Are you sure? - Mmm-hmm. Okay. ♪ And a partridge in a pear tree ♪ All right, Christmas reunion, guys! That is our tree! I don't know what to do. Let's tell her. - Not yet. - Okay. Then I'm going to get a job. - Mom. - We are living off of our savings. We can't do that for much longer. And I agree. And you working would help. But it's not gonna save us. Even if I figured out how to sell the mint, - it's not gonna happen any time soon. - So? I need to tell her the truth. We can't afford to live here any more. I have something I wanna run by you. I have something I wanna run by you. - You first. - You first. I'll leave you to it. - Oh, okay. - Excuse me. Um... We can't afford to live here. I'm having trouble coming up with the rent. And I have a possible solution. Okay. What did you have in mind? I think there is a way to generate cash for your mint. You said you sell your mint wholesale, right? Yeah. So other people can make a bunch of products using your mint and then turn around and sell it and make a huge profit? Yes, that's normally how business works. We make a profit off the wholesale. But you are not making a profit right now. I think you should cut out the middleman. - How? - Rather than sell it off to other people that can make a profit, why don't you do it yourself? There is literally an endless amount of things that use mint. You said it yourself. "You can pretty much use mint for anything." Come on. I don't sound like that. Well, you... You kind of do. You can make and sell your mint here. If your mom's Winter Bliss and Dakota's lip balm are any indication, you can have a real business with this. You think? This isn't just any mint. It's the Winters' mint. Made in Peppermint Hollow. The freshest mint. Locally grown by a hardworking family. Marketing. Yeah, I do this for a living. Let me help you. Where are the sprinkles? Here we go. Okay. Dakota, honey. Why don't you put those cookies on the pan, all right? Mmm-hmm... sure. - Dakota! - What? Come on. I thought we were cutting down on the screen time. These cookies aren't gonna bake themselves. - Let's go. Let's go. - Sorry. Are you all right? Hey. Molly's got an interesting idea. We need startup money and got to work out some of the details, but take a look. It will require all-hands-on-deck, but I think you can do it. Wait. I don't... I don't know what I'm looking at. Marketing. Marketing what? Just a second. Gracie, hi. - Our stuff? - Yes. My dad is pressuring me to sell the property, and if I do, I get the money. Perfect. You need money. But the Winters are left high and dry. That's business, Molls. I came up with this business idea for them, and if it works, it could be really profitable. They have these incredible products using their mint. What products? Kim has this Winter Bliss stuff that everybody in town swears by. Dakota has a lip balm that maybe better than Chanel. And they're peppermint cocoa and mint chocolate syrup on their pancakes is the best I've ever had. You're eating carbs? You are totally missing the point. Ooh, a Peppermint Hollow mocha with an extra shot of espresso. Hey, focus, focus. The point is they don't know how to market their products. But even if you teach them, don't you still have to sell the place? Well, unless... wait. Did you just order a Peppermint Hollow mocha? Where are you? Surprise. I'm in Peppermint Hollow. Turns out it's literally on the way to Chris' parents' house. - The airports are clear? - Since yesterday. Oh. I thought I'd come by and say hi. Is that okay? Yes, of course. So what's the address? Uh, texting you now. 1111 Peppermint place? Who makes up these names? I know. It's ridiculous. - I'll see you soon. - Okay, bye. Bye. - Thanks. - You going to the Winters'? Yes. It's okay. Small town. Well, when you get there, ask Kim about her Winter Bliss. I just heard about that stuff. Oh, it will calm her right down. It saved me when my kids were her age. Okay. Well, thanks. And tell them all Bee says hi. Sure thing. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. - Mint brownie pie. On the house. - Oh. Thank you. Mmm. I love this place. No, I didn't say it was a bad idea. I... I just don't understand how it works logistically. Uh, so my friend Gracie is in town and wants to stop by to say hi if that is all right. Oh, sure. Of course. I'll get it. Glad you said it was all right. That was fast... Hi. What are you doing here? I'm sorry. I left you a couple of messages. I know you're anxious to sell, so I thought I'd bring by the comps... Yeah. Uh, it's... Now's not really a good time. So if you just wanna leave those with me, I'll get back to you. Okay. Yeah. Actually, um... I'm... I'm not really sure if... I understand. This is a very special place. It's a big decision. Take your time. Thanks. I will be in touch. Bye. Mmm. These are good. Wow. Where's your friend? Uh... um, nobody was there. Must have been the wind. I'll get it. Hi. She won't stop crying, and I'm about to lose it. I don't know what to do and I'm going crazy. - You must be Gracie? - Yes. Hi. Hi, I'm Kim. Kim of Winter Bliss. What is Winter Bliss? May I? Oh, it's an all-natural homegrown blend of fresh mint oil, lavender, and it's all organic. That's right and, usually, if you put it on the pacifier, a couple of drops, the baby will... That's amazing. And are you sure there's no alcohol? Oh, I'm positive. And you make it yourself? She does. And do you make it for adults? No. I already asked. Oh, she's so cute. Well, when she's not wailing. Oh, she's precious. Oh. - You must be Noah. - It's nice to meet you. Okay. Excuse us. Guys, guys. - We have a problem. - No kidding. That Noah is a tall hunk of handsome. And you were right, that Winter Bliss stuff is a miracle worker. What mom wouldn't want it? It's not ours. It could be if you don't sell the property and we go into business with the Winters. She's broke and she needs money, too. - Oh. - Look at this. But even if I wanted to go into business with the Winters, I don't have the startup money and neither do they and... Why would she suggest going into business together? Where does she think the money is coming from? I can't do this. I can't sell this place. I'm not going to sell this place. You were gonna sell this place? No. I'm not selling it. Then why do you have comps? Because I did ask Patrick for those but... Were you even planning on telling us? Can you please... You have to let me explain. Why didn't you just tell us the truth? I don't know. Uh... I didn't know. I... I don't know. I changed my mind. It's complicated. I'm sorry. - Okay? - No. No, it's not okay. What's that smell? - The cookies. - The cookies. Noah, please. You... You have to understand. Okay? I... I had a plan, and I... I was gonna help you get the money and... for marketing your products. It was gonna be huge, and we could even go into business together. Business together? But you're broke. Oh, right. We weren't supposed to know that either, were we? I understand now. It's about the money. It was always about the money. Got it. Please, just listen to me. No, I'm done. Go ahead. Sell it. We don't need you or your help. Enjoy Hawaii. Should have just been honest with him from the beginning. I could see how you got distracted. Adorable kid. - Grandma with Christmas cookies. - Yeah. Now I realize why my mom never sold this place. It's not just a business. It's a home. A home with farmer Noah McDreamy. Gracie, I misled them. And even though I changed my mind about selling this place, I should have been honest with them. Now it's too late. It's never too late. You saw. I tried. I completely messed up, and now they're never gonna trust me again. Don't worry. You'll spend Christmas with us and we'll sort all of this out. - Okay? - Okay. - Thank you. - Okay. - Love you. - Love you. Bye, pink lady. I don't understand. Maybe she came here to sell, but then she changed her mind. Maybe. I think she was torn. And then she was broke. We let her into our family. We let her into our home. Well, technically, it's her home. You never even gave her a chance to explain. I saw the comps. All right, all that talk about her helping us find money and going into business together. Even if she was ultimately coming here to sell this place, which by the way, is completely within her rights to do, I think she was also trying to come up with other options. I think she really wanted to help us. But if she was just honest with us. Oh, and maybe if you had just been honest with her from the beginning, instead of pretending like you had it all under control. But I didn't. And she's gone, and she's not coming back. So what are we going to do? We're gonna get ready for a party. One last time. We're gonna celebrate Christmas like we always do. And we're gonna be grateful for what we have. Come on, Uncle Noah. You two are great together. Now, what are we going to do about getting Molly back? I'd like to take you up on that offer. Is this enough for that dress? It's enough for anything you want. We never get designer anything in here. This is incredible. Thanks. You're welcome. I can give you store credit for the balance. I'll just take the dress. You sure? Yes. I'm sure. Hey, I just want to apologize. I know I wasn't exactly the friendliest. It's okay. I understand. Noah's a great guy, and there's obviously something special between the two of you. I hate to admit I was a little jealous, but I'm glad you're still here. Well, I appreciate that. I'm actually heading out of town. - Before the party? - Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Um, change of plans. Things didn't quite, you know, work out the way I hoped. I'm really sorry to hear that. Can you make sure that this and the dress gets to Dakota for me, please? Happy to do that. Merry Christmas, Chloe. Merry Christmas. Okay. Two in each. Did you try calling her again? She's not picking up. Well, try again. I knew she'd come back! Oh. - Hey, Bee. - Hi. A little birdie named Dakota told me you could use some extra desserts for the party. - This is gonna be a candy-coated Christmas. - Oh! Bee, this is too much. No, it's not. You are a lifesaver. Thank you. It's my pleasure. Oh, and I'm bringing a tray of my chocolate brownie bites, too. - Aw! - Ooh! We'll see you all tomorrow. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you, too, and thank you so much. Look at this. Aww. That was so sweet of her, wasn't it? You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Really. Oh, maybe she brought us something else. I'll get it. Forget something? Hi. Hi. You wanna come in? No. Uh, I only have a minute. Uh, I was going to have this dropped off for Dakota, but I wanted to do it myself. - Oh. - In person. That's why you're here. I'll go get her. Well, no, wait. I... I actually wanted to say something to you, too. I do, too. I owe you an apology. I wasn't honest about our financial situation. I wasn't either. I was planning on selling the property and using the money for my business with Gracie. But, then I met you ridiculously nice people and I realized that I couldn't go through with it. When I found out that I was broke, I didn't think I had a choice. Why didn't you just tell us? Because I was embarrassed and torn. And spending time with you and your family and making pancakes... - Burning pancakes. - ...baking cookies... - Burning cookies. - ...and shopping for a Christmas tree. - I got nothing there. It is the perfect tree. - Yeah, it's the perfect tree. See? I didn't want to take that away from me, and I couldn't take all of this away from you. So, that's why you came up with the business plan. I mean, I've got the marketing skills, and you've got unique products. And you were right. We need money, and neither of us have it. And... and not to mention you probably never want to work with me now. In the last week, my life has been turned upside down, and... ...somehow, being with you almost made me forget that anything was wrong. You want to talk about miracles? That is a miracle. Um... anyway, uh, I have to go. Molly. Molly, wait. I can't believe you just did that. It got your attention. - This isn't funny. - It's a little funny. What if we can find the seed money? - How? - I don't know. But we should at least try, don't you think? Stay for Christmas. I'll reach out to all the people I know and you reach out to all the people you know. - What if we can't find the money? - But what if we can? There's always risk in business, you know that. Even if we can't work together, can't we at least be together? Just to be clear, you... want to be with me? I mean... kinda. Come on, Molly. Dakota says we're great together. She's a smart kid. Under one condition. Anything. Close your eyes. - You can't see anything? - I can't see anything. Hmm. Now, that, that is funny. Uh-huh. All right. - I spoke to Gracie and Patrick. - I talked to Bee. - You first. - You first. Patrick said I could easily take out a home equity line against the property, which means we could have upfront cash. And Gracie said she's all-in to partner with us. - Bee's willing to invest, too. - What? - This is so cool. - Ooh! This is cool. But now we really need to get ready for the party. Okay? That's okay. I'll clean up this part. Go ahead. Hi, Daddy! How did the meeting go? - I'm still working on it. - I am sure it will be okay. Yes, it will, it will. Um... How's the selling going? Actually, I'm not selling. Uh, I'm taking out a home equity line against the house, and with Gracie's investment plus a few others', we've decided to go into business with the Winters. I know it's a risk. But, I really believe it'll pay off. Who are you? What have you done with my daughter? Molly, I'm proud of you. Your mother would be proud of you, too. Thanks, Daddy. I really wish you were here. Me too. Next year. Next year for sure. I love you. I love you, baby. Okay. Gracie! Did you meet Chloe? - Oh, yeah. - Oh, good, good. Have fun. I'll see you guys later. Excuse me, Bee. I finally got the chance to try your peppermint brownie bites, and I loved them. So, you do like mint. I do. I really do. - Oh, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. So, would you like to try my brownie bites? I thought you'd never ask. You'll love it. - Amazing. - Good, right? Hi! - Hey! - There she is. - Oh, hello, sunshine! - Oh, look at them. Is that Parker? - Mmm-hmm, - Yeah, that's Parker. Not sure I'm ready for that. Well, she is. Ooh, how sweet. - Young love. - Yeah. Come on. - Oh. - My God! Oh! Talk about young love. Here you go. All right, Dakota first. Drumroll. Huh! How'd I do? - Just kidding! No, I love it. I love it. - Come on! Okay. Let's see what this is. - Love it! - That's exactly what you wanted. Look at this! Oh, my goodness! Look at this! What is this? Look at that. Oh, Honey! "World's Greatest Grandma"! Oh, my goodness! That's so sweet. Okay. Oh, my God! "Some things are 'mint' to be"! You guys. Must be Santa. Um, I'll get this. Oh! Look what the reindeer dragged in. Hey, Kim! It's good to see you. Thanks for inviting me. - Well, of course. - Daddy? - Surprise! - Oh, here... I can't believe you're here! Yeah, well, it's Christmas, baby. Of course, I'm here. Guess what? The board agreed to restructure our debt. We may have to sell a few hotels, But, we're back in business. Ah, that's amazing. Oh, wonderful news! Come on, let's go eat. Okay. I love this house. Oh, Daddy! Merry Christmas! - Wow! - Those look so good. Molly and pancakes? I can't believe it. Those are perfect. Slide those right over. Anybody want non-burnt pancakes? Oh! It's a Christmas miracle! Oh! Molly and Fred, we are so glad that you are here with us. Thank you. It's been a long time since we've had a proper Christmas at home. Thank you for including me and for taking such good care of my Molly. Aw! Our pleasure. Truly, this has been a life-changing holiday, and I have all of you to thank. I am grateful and honored to be spending Christmas with you all. - Here's to many more. - Oh! Merry Christmas! Hawaii's got nothing on this. I am so excited to be a part of this holiday movie. Let's go! This is going to be a candy-coated Christmas. This is the first time I have ever been on a real movie set, so it's really fun to be a part of it. Just take in all the fun. Action! Hi! What can I get for you? When I walked in to the bakery for the first time, I just was completely enchanted. We're open and ready for customers. I think it needed to feel like it reflected me/Bee, somewhat. And it completely exceeded my expectations. - Everything looks perfect! - So beautiful! You're making me look so good. Thank you! I have to say, there's a lot of great food in this movie. If these are supposed to be mine, I should sample it. I contributed some of my own recipes to Bee's Bakery. My peppermint brownie bites make an appearance, my peppermint meringues, mint chocolate cookies. The holidays just lend themselves so well to peppermint anything. That it's taking place in a town called Peppermint Hollow is just perfect. You could film a Christmas movie here if you wanted to. Oh, absolutely. What a great idea! I was a fish out of water on this movie set. But after the first few scenes that I shot, I was so at ease, and I am like, "I don't ever want to leave." Cut! I was half-communicating with Ree Ree there. - Oh, guys! - You're just showing off now. Do go on. I might want to be an actor the rest of my life. But only in Christmas movies. You'll love it. - Amazing. - I mean, who doesn't love a Christmas movie? Merry Christmas.
