Here you go. Shh. Are you frightened? No. Yes. Well, so am I. Can you move at all? I-i-I'll try, if there's some place to go. The Farnsworth school is just on the other side of the woods. The miss Martha Farnsworth seminary for young ladies. Any men about there? Just four other students, a teacher and miss Farnsworth. The slaves left. I can't say you'll be welcome as a yankee, but... it will be better than here. True enough. I'll accept your invitation. Can you give me a hand up? Just give me a minute, will ya? To catch my breath. Yes, sir. Come here. You're a lot heavier than my brother. Where's he now? He got killed in Tennessee. Well, that wasn't none of us. I was never in Tennessee. What's your name? Amelia dabney. Mine's mcburney. Corporal John mcburney. Pleased to make your acquaintance, corporal. Off to, where was it now? To miss Farnsworth's seminary for young ladies. With only five students. The other girls have gone home, but miss Martha kept it open. It was mainly because we don't have anywhere else to go. My home is Georgia, but my mother thought it would be better if I stayed up here in Virginia for a while, what with your general sherman down there so close to Atlanta and all. Did you run away? I was with the 66th, out of New York. We got hit... I fell, and... Everything began to Blaze. Do you want to go back? I can show you the way. Nah, not now. Maybe later when my leg stops bleeding. And now the verb "to be." Miss Emily. Miss Martha! Marie. Come with me. Help! Miss Martha! Stop! Miss Martha! Amy! Help! What happened? Are you alright? How did he get here? He was all alone in the woods. I couldn't leave him there to die. You know you're not supposed to go that far! Is he dead? Uh... No. Not yet. Quick. We need to move him to the porch. Lift him up. Edwina, grab a shoulder. Yes, miss Martha. Girls, let's get him to the porch. Quick. Quick! We all need to help. Get his legs, girls. One, two, three. He could be dangerous, miss Martha. Just pick him up. Sixty-sixth New York regiment. Grateful to be your prisoner. He's a real blue belly! You know, they rape every Southern woman they come across. Would you stop that nonsense, Jane? It's true. Leave him here. You couldn't tell from his face he was a yankee, would ya? Amy, I need you to run inside, get the blue rag and tie it on the gate. Blue rag, so the patrol knows we've captured a live yankee. Why did you not call out? You must have seen them crossing the fields. I'm sorry, miss Martha. I forgot it was my turn to look out. You cannot forget this. Next time, it'll be union scroungers in our garden. That's how we lost most of our chickens. Alright, now... Marie, get up there. Call out if you see any of our soldiers. Yes, ma'am. We ought to wash his wound. Yes. And we're gonna need to sew it up. Uh... Amy, did I not tell you, get the blue rag, tie it on the gate for the patrol. After all the blood he's lost, he'd die now if he went. Wouldn't it be the Christian thing to do? Yes. Yes, you're right. It would be. He's never gonna make it. So, we're gonna wait until he's in better shape... Before he's taken away. Get him inside. Come on. I'm going to need you to put hot water on to boil, Emily. And we're gonna need cloth. Anything we can spare. Alicia, Jane, you find that cloth and you bring it to the music room, you hear me? Yes, ma'am. Alright. Miss edwina. Shut the door, girls. I need scissors. Yes, miss Martha. Here. Go get me some more cloth. I need cloth now. Yes, miss Martha. Enough metal in here to shoe a horse. I think I got most of it. I'm gonna need a needle now. Get me the thread and needle. Back up. I can't-- stop it. Do you hear what they're saying? No. Shh! Edwina, get me some water. I'm gonna clean him. Yes, miss Martha. I thought so. Is he gonna die? Not today, i don't think. What'll happen? We'll turn him over to the patrol, of course. In the meantime, I don't want you lurking around here or poking around in this room. Do you hear me? His name, in case wondered, is corporal John mcburney. Well, he's not going to be here long enough for his name to make any difference to us. Now, there's been too much distraction, so no more studying today. We have a lot of mendin' to do. Mm, good. To the sewing room. Come on, girls. I won't be here much longer, Amy. Careful, keep your stitches in a straight row. Jane, it's the same for you as all of us. You don't leave because there's nowhere for you to go. There is so! My father is with general Lee and if I so desired, soldiers would come escort me to him right now. If anybody knew where that was. Nice and even. My mother wrote me from Charleston that the blockade was fearful. She says I'd probably eat better here than I would at home. You do. You should've never brought that yankee here. I agree. He's probably a spy, and will let the blue bellies in at night to raid our garden. I doubt that, miss Jane. Miss edwina, aren't you afraid of that blue belly? No. And it is very bad manners to call him that. He has a name. Corporal John mcburney. John. Let's see. Am I doin' it right? Yes, but you can get your stitches closer together. Alright. It's our boys, miss Martha. They're passing our way. Can't we go and greet 'em? No. I don't want them to see you girls. I think they have some prisoners. Go upstairs. Now! What's gonna happen? I can't see. Shh! What's the news? Takin' these yanks to prison to die. Good evening, captain. Good evening, ma'am. You think miss Martha's gonna tell them about him? You're all alone here, ma'am? Just a few of us. Well... Is she tellin' him? I can't tell. Well, you take care, ma'am. A lot of these yanks, they got separated from their outfits and they're just roamin' through these woods, and they're desperate. I was wondering if you might have a few cartridges you could spare. What good would that do you, ma'am? My father has left me his revolver. I'd feel much safer if I knew I could use it. Well, now... let's see what I can spare. There you are. You're welcome. Thank you. He's givin' her something. They're leavin'. She didn't tell them! What are you doing up here? I'll see you later. I was just talkin' with him privately. Let him rest. He's not one of your wounded birds or beetles. We pray for all of those we have lost. And we pray that we will be kept from harm throughout the night. Amen. Amen. Would anyone like to ask for special blessings? I pray that the lord see fit to restore the health of the wounded soldier. We pray for his return to health and his early departure. Do you think he'll live? I don't know. You know, if you don't hear him in the night, he'll come and get you. You know he will. To your rooms quietly, girls. Good morning. It is morning. It's about 6:00. I thought as much from the larks I heard singin'. Do you like birds? Oh, I love them. Anything wild, I love. Wild and free. I think they're Robins. I can show you some nests i collected. That would be my great pleasure. I better go. Miss Martha's coming to fix your bandages. Alright, then. Thank you, darlin'. I like peas. You're gettin' quite good at that. Mm-hmm. Can I have a pea? Yes. Oh, I dropped it. Oh, now. Can I have another one? Good morning. Good morning. How's the yank doin'? He's fine, much better. Miss edwina, how long is he gonna stay in the music room? Until he's much better. But how am I supposed to practice my violin with a dangerous enemy in the same room? Miss Jane... please. Good morning, girls. Good morning, miss Martha. Tell me, Amy, did you find any mushrooms while you were out collecting soldiers? I did, but I'm not sure they're safe to eat. Hmm. Well, we'll take a look at them later, shall we? Yes, ma'am. Seems like the soldier being here is having an effect. Get about your business. You have work and studies to do. Shall we not have music here today? No, go to the library. Good morning, corporal. Good morning, ma'am. I think I'm disruptin' your place here. Yes. Indeed, you are. You don't mince words, ma'am. You speak right up. I like that. Do you, indeed? You think it makes a great difference to me whether you like it or not? I'm sure my opinion means nothin' at all to you, ma'am. I'm... I'm not lookin' for your praise. Are you not? What are you looking for then? Nothin'. You've already given me plenty. And I'm-I'm most appreciative. Aren't you afraid that I'll turn you over to our soldiers? No, I don't think so. I'm not... I don't say you won't do it, but... You know, I think there are far worse things that could happen to me. I don't relish the prospect of prison, but it's better than bein' dead. And that's what I'd be if you hadn't helped. Not necessarily. Is your leg paining you? Some. Well, I hear numbness would be more grave. Indeed. There's some Brandy, if you wish. Now that would be a pleasure. It's not being offered for your pleasure, only for your comfort. Yes, ma'am. I must remind you, corporal mcburney, you are not a guest here. You are a most unwelcome visitor. And we do not propose to entertain you. Well, I wouldn't expect it, ma'am. Although you'll find I'm easily amused. What is it, miss? I just wondered if there's anything I can do to help. No. There's nothing you can do. You have enough studies and other work to keep you well occupied. I only thought to help. That won't be necessary. And, miss Alicia, you can tell the others that this room is off limits. Yes, ma'am. You can trust me in your place, ma'am. Well, I don't know you. Well, I think if you knew me, you... You would. You won't be here long enough for that. Ma'am? Yes, corporal? I don't suppose there's any chance of a-a bit of soap and a razor, is there? Let me see what I can find. Thank you, ma'am. Careful with your e's. Very good, miss Jane. Are we almost done? Almost. This is the last row. Alicia. I wanted to bring this to you last night for fear that you might die before morning. But then, I thought since you were unconscious, you wouldn't be able to read it anyway. That's very logical. Are you catholic? I was baptized. Well, then, here's a prayer book for ya. Thank you. I thought you might need to confess if you're on the verge of death. Oh, I think I'll be able to hang around for just a little bit longer. Where's me manners? I'm, I'm John Patrick mcburney. Pleased to meet you, sir. Pleased to meet you, madam. Just a moment, miss. Where do you think you're going in my Pearl earrings? Oh, miss edwina, don't be hateful. Everyone's dressing up today. Not in my jewelry, they're not. Oh, I'll give 'em back. And how beautiful you looked this mornin'. You're all dressed up yourself. I am not. I haven't seen that lovely pin since last Christmas. Get to your work. Wait. Don't run away. Did you want to see me about something? Thank you. They look as if you've been trying to dig a pit with them. I was. In the middle of battle with all that iron flyin' overhead... Me first thought was to bury meself. But when you couldn't, you ran? I did. I surely to god did. It wasn't very brave of you to run. Well, maybe not. But it was smart, I think. Because you're alive? And now I've met you. You don't even know me. Ah, I know your name... Miss edwina morrow. And what else have you been told about me? Nothin' besides your name. It's a lovely name. I hope the girls weren't tellin' stories. What do you care what they say about you? I don't. I just didn't want you to get the wrong impression. Then you do care what I think about you. You're a stranger here, that's all. And I don't want you to be misled. Well, then maybe you can set me off on the right foot and tell me a little bit about yourself. Where are you from... Miss edwina morrow? My father's home is Richmond. Uh, I left Savannah when I was quite young. We lived in several places for my father's enterprises. And are you waitin' for a sweetheart to return when this war is over? I have no one in the military. Then how did you end up in this place? Why are you so interested in me? I just reckon that you and I, we're both a little out of place here. I bet you're the independent sort. And the other girls, they don't even know how to get close to you. And then, of course, there's your looks. That doesn't matter to me. Well, you can bet it matters to other people. Sorry to tell you, and I hope you don't mind me telling you, but, well, in all my travels, I've never come across such a delicate beauty as yours. Tell me something, will ya? Miss morrow... It's okay. If you could have anything... What's your biggest wish? If you could have anything in the world, what would it be? Anything? Yeah, anything. To be taken far away from here. Good day, corporal mcburney. John. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, "and I will give you rest. "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, "for I am meek and lowly in heart. "And ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy..." Can't you wait? Shh. Alright. "For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light." Goodnight, corporal. I ask god's blessing on our armies and the safe return of our boys. Yes. One, two, three, four. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Whoo! Are you ready? Okay. Okay. Don't do that! Okay, you ought to be... Here you go, Henry. Alright. Come here. Corporal mcburney gave me one of his buttons. Miss Amy. Bless us and bless thee thy gifts which we receive from thy bountiful goodness through Jesus Christ, our lord. Amen. Amen. It has occurred to me that we might reflect on the unexpected presence of corporal mcburney in the house. Until his leg heals, of course. And we might discuss how we may practice compassion and what else we might learn from his presence here. What does each of you think of this? Miss Alicia, can you tell us what you think we may learn from his presence here? Well, maybe the sight of him will remind us there's something else in the world besides lessons. Well, it seems to me that is all there should be for any young lady your age. If we learn our lessons properly when young, we can expect a calm and happy life when faced with the distractions of the world. With the presence of this hateful enemy, it will be a constant reminder to us that the war is still going on... And the sacrifices and prayers we must make. Mmm. May I say that any breath of fresh air from the outside world, i think is welcome to us all. I heard he's a mercenary, so maybe he's not even really an enemy. What's a mercenary? It means he's just paid by the army to fight. He's not really fightin' the cause. Well, we don't know about that. He seems to be a student of nature, so I expect to learn about flora and wildlife. He seems to be a sensitive person. Does he? I found him... understanding. Do you, indeed? Why, you must share more of your findings with us, edwina. As dedicated christians, we would join the corporal after dinner for a prayer, before we retire. Yes, miss Martha. Shall we? Corporal. Would you care to join us for an evenin' prayer? Yes, ma'am. But first maybe we'll have a little music, if that's not too disturbing for you. Oh, no disturbance at all. No, I'd love to hear a bit of music. Miss Jane? Yes, ma'am. Miss Jane, you play beautifully. Doesn't she? Indeed. Could it be Yankees? Possibly not. It could be some of our own. Edwina, wait here with the girls. If it is enemy soldiers, I'll rap on the door three times. We'll go to the woods and meet you there. What about the corporal? Well, he's in no condition to leave. He will remain here. Shh! All of you. Can I help you, gentlemen? I think it's one of our men. I hope so. Miss edwina, what are we going to do? Don't worry. Don't worry, girls. Right this way. Why are they here? Do you think they're here for the corporal? They may be. Why don't we turn him in? Are they coming? I'm so scared... It's alright. There's two of them. Two of our own. I've given them something to eat. They're in the kitchen. Why did they come? To, uh, to offer their assistance. The army is about to leave the vicinity. As of yet, I haven't told them about the corporal. But I might ask them to take him with them. But he couldn't ride without hurtin' his leg. Well, I could tell them that he's wounded. Suggest that they come back. But that could be weeks, could even be months. They'll probably insist on taking him right now. And who knows what'll happen to him. They could shoot him and leave him along the road to die. I could allow the corporal to stay until he's recovered. And then we could send him on his way, alone. Oh, yes. There is Christian charity to be considered. You keep talking about him as if he wasn't right here in this room. Are there doubts if we can really consider him an enemy? Please, miss Martha! I will allow corporal mcburney to stay here until his leg is healed. But if any of you is opposed to it, I will tell the soldiers right now and they will decide what his fate would be. Any of you? Miss Jane? Well, then. He will stay. The decision is made. Off to bed. All of you. Come on, girls. Off you go. Can we go greet the soldiers? No. No, no. I do not want to put temptation in their way. Come on, girls. Miss edwina. This has been quite a night. I have to say, when they saw me, they said, "there is nothing more frightening than a startled woman with her gun." When I return would you care to join me for a Brandy, corporal? I'd like that very much, ma'am. How long do you think he'll stay here? Miss Martha seems to be warming up to him. And I believe he likes it here. What would you know? I've talked with him privately. You think just because you found him, you have some sort of special relationship with him? You're just jealous. Shh! Must be tiring for you. I can't say that it hasn't been a struggle. Well, I admire your strength. I know it must be hard for you to be strong all the time for these girls. They're lucky to have a woman such as yourself to keep going for all of them. I'm just trying to give them what they need to survive in these times. It's a very different world out there that they're going into. I don't think they realize. No, they can't know what it's like out there. Sometimes I get so tired... I pray that the end is near. I can't make any sense of it, how much everyone has suffered. There's no sense to be made of it. Hmm... Did you have someone before the war? I did. Well, I'm sorry. Everyone has lost so much. I was a coward to leave. You don't realize what battle really is until you've seen it. It must be devastating. I was fresh off the boat from Dublin and... Had nothing. I took $300 to take another man's place. I see. We've all done things out of character. We will see to it that you make your way home. Thank you for your company, corporal. If you'll excuse me, I'll, uh... I must insist that you rest. Well, good night, ma'am. Have a good, have a good evenin'. Good evening, corporal. You got it! Miss Martha! Miss Martha, come look! What is it? Be careful. Don't put too much weight on the bad leg. Yes, ma'am. I still wouldn't rush nature to take its course, but if you want to risk doing this... Oh, corporal, please. Steady yourself. Can you help me outside, miss Amy? Yes, of course. Good day, corporal. Ladies. It's your turn in the kitchen garden. That's right. I'm helping the corporal, as you can see. I'm sure we could relieve you. No, that's enough. I will decide whose work is needed. On your way, girls. Yes, ma'am. This reminds me of the first time we met, you and me. Your roses need pruning. And those hedges are in terrible shape. Your whole flower garden needs tending. I'll-I'll get to it tomorrow. Surtout pas! You'll do nothing of the kind. Have you had much gardening experience, corporal mcburney? I've done a bit of it, yeah. Well, if you really have such a gift for gardenin', you may assist us later in your convalescence. It would be my pleasure, ma'am. Come. You have work to do, miss Amy. Here's some water, if you like. I'd like it very much. Thank you, my girl. Miss Martha told me to return to my lessons. But I told her all the things you need me to do. Yes, I'm counting on you to keep me clumsy feet away from birds' nests. That, and keep me company. Listen, don't tell any of the others, but I consider you to be my best friend in this whole place. You do? Yeah, of course I do. Geez, if it wasn't for you, I'd still be sittin' under that tree. Thank you, my lady. You better not be saying any unkind things about us to the corporal. Now, why would I ever do that? Corporal. I was wondering how your leg is. It, uh, twinges a bit now and then. I would expect that. You will recall I was the one who was opposed to you walkin' on it so soon. Yes, ma'am. However... I appreciate your desire to be active. May I check? Yes, ma'am. Well... The stitches, uh... They're holding nicely. Hmm. The wound is healin' very well. When do you think I'll be fully recovered? Some would say you're recovered now. I'm sure the army surgeons would say you are ready to return to duty. So, you'd like me to leave? - I didn't say that. - No, of course not. You're, you're far too polite a lady to be so blunt about it. I'm as blunt as I need to be, corporal mcburney. Since you brought it up, i would say that the leg will be healed well enough to leave by the end of the week. Well, that's in just a few days. Yes, it is. Where would I go? I'm afraid that's entirely your business where you go, corporal. However, i-i think you may find columns of your troops on the main road to Richmond. Well, your garden should have continual care, I mean, you need a full-time gardener. Perhaps. But I expect, in these times, one just has to do without. It's a shame, isn't it, that i couldn't have remained helpless? When? I don't know exactly, but she asked him to leave. Well, we'll just have to make it so pleasant for him that he won't even consider leavin' us. We might suggest to miss Martha that the corporal join us at the table for dinner. Yes, he must get lonely eating alone in his room. We can show him some real Southern hospitality. Miss edwina morrow. I've missed being near you. You have? Yeah. You have no idea how lovely you are. Miss Farnsworth suggested it's time for me to be on me way. I don't want you to leave. I don't want to leave. I love you, edwina. Please, don't... ever say that unless you mean it. I do mean it. Geez, I knew exactly how i felt about you the first time we talked. I was too afraid to say anything for fear that you'd never let me near you again. I'm only tellin' you now 'cause I'm, I'm runnin' out of time. It might be my last chance. I realize I'm not good enough for you, edwina. That's not true. It is. You just don't believe in yourself enough to see it so. I'm tired of this war. I want to see the west. If you can get to Richmond, my father can help you. Come with me. Corporal? Miss Martha invites you to dine with us. Oh, have you heard? Miss Martha invited the corporal to dinner tonight. Have you got it? Almost. Miss Alicia, too much cream. Now, you stop your gigglin'. Manners. That dress is very becoming, miss edwina. Thank you. There might be other attractive shoulders here if we were all permitted to wear such dresses. I wouldn't say it's entirely suitable for a young ladies school, but we know miss edwina is accustomed to town society with different views. I would suggest that we change the subject and that miss edwina draws her shawl. Yes. That will avoid any more speculation on the subject. This is the best meal I've had in a long time. Thank you, ma'am. Merci beaucoup. Miss Alicia made the pie herself. I hope you like apple pie. I love apple pie. It's me favorite. Is that my recipe, Alicia? It is. I picked the apples. They're delicious. Apple pie's my favorite too. Really? We've been fortunate to have enough water for our garden. Yes, ma'am. Shall we have some music? That's a beautiful song, Jane. Isn't it? I always thought it was rather romantic. Quite. Mademoiselle, can i interest you in a dance? Okay, spin. Oh, wait, wait. Miss morrow. I haven't had a chance to tell you how ravishing you look tonight. Thank you. May I come and see you this evening? Would you care for a digestif, corporal? Yes, ma'am. What a beautiful evening, ma'am. Isn't it? The music's lovely. Yes, it is. My father had quite a cellar in his day. This house was full of parties. People traveled from all over to come here. Well, it must have been splendid, madam. Yes. Yes, it was. There were carriages lined up. There were beautiful, beautiful gowns. Men in full dress. Elegant dinners and balls. Well, a toast to you, miss Martha. You must be the bravest woman I've ever known. No, all bravery is, is... Is doing what is needed at the time. - Tell me, corporal... - Yes, ma'am? Do you think this war will be over soon? Very soon. Sooner than you southerners are ready to admit. I know. And you could do with some help around here. A man's help. Very nice, miss Jane. Girls! Let's gather for our evening prayers. Dear lord, we ask for your protection over our school and we ask for your protection over the brave members of our army. And that we look after our friend, corporal mcburney, as he makes his way. Yes. Yes, miss Amy. Corporal mcburney's stay here has taught us all a very important lesson, that the enemy, as an individual, is not what we believe. Let us bow our heads in silent meditation. Good night, miss edwina. Good night, corporal. Good night, ma'am. Please! Stop it! I'm not doing anything! Quiet, girls! You need your rest. Indeed. Good night, ma'am. Thank you for your, your hospitality. Good night, corporal. Go to sleep. John. Edwina? Darling, wait. Edwina... Look, just, please... No. Lovely edwina... please. No! No! No! No, no! Get me some rope! Did he die? Get me some rope. We need to stop the bleedin'. Hurry up! What happened? I was so shaken by my experience i could hardly leave my room. It was terrible the way he rushed in... And then edwina came up and began fightin' him. We need to move him to the table. You heard me. Hurry up. I didn't do anything. Pick him up. Help me! Help me move him! Quiet. Be quiet. What are you going to do? Quiet. Go to your rooms. Go! I need you to go to your rooms, now. Go! We need to remove it. What? The leg is badly broken. I can't repair it. I'm not a surgeon. - He's losing so much blood. - Please. The leg will mortify by the morning. What do you want me to do? Do you want him to die? No! No! Edwina, look at me! I need rags. I need chloroform. Go to the smokehouse. Get the saw, now! Hurry. Hurry! Quickly! He's losing blood! Edwina... Bring me the anatomy book. "My soul waiteth for the lord more than that they watch for the morning." Jesus Christ! What have you done to me? Oh, Jesus! I've been waiting for days to talk to you. You don't know how sorry I am! You're sorry? You could have stopped her! Why didn't you stop her? I couldn't. There she is! The butcher! We saved your life. We had no choice. You didn't have a choice, or you wanted to punish me for not going to your room! It was an accident, she saved your life. You're worse than she is! Did you plan this together? Now you have me at your Beck and call! John, please. Get away from me! Get me something for the pain! We'll bring you a bottle. You didn't tell me it was a house of mad women. Miss Martha, what are we gonna do? Marie said she saw union troops approaching. If we let him go, he'll join up with them. He would tell them about our garden and our cow. He'll lead them back here. Exactly. You vengeful bitches! How are you doin'? I tried to ease miss Martha's suspicions about us. I was so worried about you. You'll be strong again soon. Shut up. Can I get you anything? Get me the key. She would know if it went missin'. You know I'd get in trouble for that. Just get it for me. There might be another one in her drawer with her valuables. No. Get me that key. Alright. I will. Who's there? It's Jane. Jane... You... open the door for a minute, will ya? Please? Jane. Jane, where are you going? I'm just goin' out to the garden, corporal. Play a song for me, will ya? Will you do that for me, Jane? Will you... play one of those pretty songs? Pretty like you. Please. I'm not really a bad fella, Jane. Do you think you'll be able to put in a... A good word for me with miss Martha and the others? You know, maybe things will be able to go back to the way they were before. Will you ask her to let me stay? She seems to be doing that. No, I mean, for her to tell me I'm welcome. For her to talk to me and let you all talk to me. Would you see if she'll do that? Yes, sir. Thank you, Jane. I wish he would just leave. Oh, we have to wait for the union troops to pass, which will be soon. I expect our men to push them back. Miss Martha, I'm scared. I know, dear. He said he was gonna kill me if I made any noise. Oh, be quiet. Please. We must all be strong. He wasn't harmin' her. She isn't harmed, is she? He intended to harm her. We're not sure what his intentions were. Don't fence with me, miss. I don't think he meant to harm anyone. Perhaps not, but we can't be sure. Well, well, well. Stand back. What are you lovely Southern ladies learnin' today? The art of castration? Why don't you just go? We'll help you get your possessions and you can leave. Oh, I can leave now, can I? Just without me leg! Are you finished dressin' me up? I'll leave when i goddamn want to. Everything's gonna change around here from now on! Let me tell you how it's gonna go! Do you even know why edwina threw me down those stairs? And why your miss Martha there, she took me leg! Because I wouldn't go to her room! Or edwina's! No, no, no, no. They didn't like that that much. That's enough. I'll tell you when it's enough! Please don't shout, corporal mcburney. You'll frighten Henry here. Amy... Amy... Stay away from me! It's alright. It's alright. Miss Martha, what are we gonna do? Yes, it'll be alright. It'll be alright. I need you to get the blue rag. I need you to go to the front gate. Hmm? You pretend like you're gatherin' walnuts. And you tie that rag on the gate, and then you come right back here. Can you do that? Yes, miss Martha. Yes. Good. Hurry. What are you doin' there, miss Amy? Go inside and stay there. Help! Leave me alone! What did miss Martha say? Get away from me! Why are you sending signals? Miss Martha! Amy! What are you thinking, sending a little girl to do your biddin'? Corporal mcburney, please. It's alright. You come inside with us. We have, we have one more bottle of bourbon in the cellar. Go on then. Get over there and sit down. Sit down. Sit down, the lot of youse! Amy, I thought we were friends. I never meant any harm to any of youse. And look at me. Really, look what you've done to me. I'd rather be dead than be a man without a leg, hobblin' around. Why didn't you kill me when you had the chance? I see how youse all look at me, your disgust and your pity. I'm not even a man anymore! I took your kindness and I trusted you, and ya, ya toyed with me, and ya butchered me! Well, I've had enough of your devilment. I've got six shots left in this gun, and the next one of you that tries something, I swear to god you're gonna get it from me! Do ya hear me? The next shot is for one of youse. Edwina, edwina, don't... What are you doing? No. No! What do you want? How could you let her be alone with him? Alicia, please, just let me think. I knew it was a mistake when you brought him here, Amy. You can't blame her, she did it out of the goodness of her heart. I'm trying to think. We have to rid ourselves of him. We're not safe here... While he's in the house. Can't we leave him back in the woods? No, it'd be too much of a risk. We could hang him. We cannot resort to brutality. We can't go on like this with him here. I know, that's why i need to think. I'm trying to think of a plan. I can tell him he's no longer welcome around certain people. You'll do nothing of the sort. You're a fool if you think he's going to take your suggestions. Girls, please. Please! Couldn't we still go get help? I can't. I can't leave you here with him alone. He loved the mushrooms. The corporal loved the mushrooms we served him. What if Amy picked the kind... Some especially for him? Do you think you could do that, Amy? You think you could find the mushrooms? Well, you'd have to be very quiet. You'd have to go... Very quickly out of the house. Yes? Yes, miss Martha. He mustn't see you. Hmm. That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna make a nice supper. We'll invite him for a big send-off. Prepare a smoked ham, and we'll make biscuits and then we'll saute the mushrooms in butter and wine. Allow me. Thank you. You're welcome. - Good evening, ma'am. - Good evening. Ladies. Corporal mcburney, we'd like you to know that we harbor no ill feelings, and we've prepared this meal in commemoration of your journey ahead. Well, thank you for excusing my... my outburst. Think nothing of it. I'd like to thank you for all this as well. It looks, uh... It looks just about the finest meal I've ever seen. Well, bon appetit. Yes. Wait, wait, wait, wait... We must say grace. Lord, bless this food, and Grant that we may be thankful for thy mercy's be. Amen. Amen. Would you pour me a glass of wine please, Marie? Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Miss Amy picked the mushrooms today. Would you like some, corporal? I would indeed, yeah. I'm fond of them. Thank you, miss Marie. Miss morrow? Miss edwina, you don't like mushrooms. That's true, i don't really. Alright, then. Thank you. Mm. Jesus. Miss Amy, you picked these mushrooms yourself? Delicious. I'm not gonna stay here for much longer... But, um, while I'm here, I wanna do my best to make it up for you know, all the unfortunate things that happened. Miss Alicia... Tell us, how is your embroidery coming along? It's coming along just fine. I do have to say, the roses are looking splendid. And the blush noisette, it's always been one of my favorites. John? I can't breathe. John? What's the matter? What... What... What's the matter? Miss Amy. Keep your stitches in a straight line, like I showed you. Edwina. Edwina? Yes, miss Martha. Not so tight, miss Amy. Amen.
