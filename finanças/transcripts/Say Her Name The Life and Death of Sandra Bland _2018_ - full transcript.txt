Good afternoon, my beautiful kings and queens. It is Wednesday, April 8, 2015. Hopefully, you are out there or were out there this morning doing something productive, successful, something that is going to help establish your kingdom and queendom. Today, "Sandy Speaks" is going to focus directly on my white people. White people. Yes. Black people know that all lives matter. But what I need you guys to understand is that being a black person in America is very, very hard. I am not a racist. I grew up in Villa Park, Illinois, was the only black girl on an all-white cheerleading squad, so I had to learn how to deal with white people. But I want the white folks to really understand out there, not all of us, but some of us, are really doing as much as we can. And we can't help but get pissed off when we see situations where it's clear the black life didn't matter. Because in the news that we've seen as of late, you could stand there, surrender to the cops, and still be killed. On Friday, July 10, Ms. Bland was stopped by the Texas Department of Public Safety for a traffic infraction. The state trooper arrested Bland for assault of a public servant, then transported Ms. Bland to the Waller County jail. On Monday, July 13, at 8:58 a.m. jailers went to cell 95 and observed Ms. Bland hanging from her privacy partition in her cell. The Harris County of Texas medical examiner's office listed the manner of death as a suicide. However, there may be some questions that cannot be answered, since this investigation is yet to be completed. Ooh, Lord have mercy. Okay. Ooh! Oh, here we go. Here we go. Aw, man. It looks better in person. Wow. Hey, girl! I just can't get over, like, how surreal it looks, you know? Okay, sister. Losing you has been the hardest thing that... I thought I would ever have to go through, but I feel like it's made me a stronger person. So this is our letter that we wrote to the attorney general. And it says, "My name is Sharon Cooper, and I am Sandra Bland's sister. "My sister Sandra, affectionately known as Sandy, "was a vibrant, outspoken, and intelligent 28-year-old who was absolutely full of life. "Since Sandra's death, we have been in mourning, "but candidly, our ability to mourn has been paralyzed "by the unusual and unsettling circumstances surrounding her death. That is why I am writing to you." You've got a lot of people that's down here standing with you and us. People you know, people you don't know. A lot of people who you don't know. I don't think Officer Encinia knew whose you were and who you belong to when he pulled you over. Well, each day, you let him know what a mistake he made. We're going to get to the bottom of it. No matter how long it takes. And we gonna change history, just like you wanted to. An innocent daughter's life was snatched, in a building right behind us. This is no longer just a Ferguson issue. It is not just a Baltimore issue. This is an American issue. And we will not go away until it is answered. -Say her name! -Sandra Bland! -Say her name! -Sandra Bland! -Say her name! -Sandra Bland! Won't you say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! The trip Sandy and I took over the Fourth of July weekend. She made all of this music for Mom... to sit in the car, and dance, laugh, sing... and when she was driving, Sandy kept talking about going back to Texas. She said, "Now I know what I'm supposed to be doing." She talked about this almost the whole ride. She kept saying, "My purpose is to go back to Texas, and to stop all of the injustices against blacks." Sandy called me on July 11... to let me know that she had been arrested. I said, "What are you in jail for?" She said, "You know, I really don't know." And she said, "My arm, my arm is hurting really bad." And I could hear her talking to the guards in the background. Then she said, "I'll call you back." And she hung up the phone, and she never called back. I wouldn't wish this hurt on anyone. Anyone. Monday morning, when Ms. Bland was found in her cell, and the ambulance and medical help was being called, then I was notified. When I walked back to the cell, the justice of the peace was already here. It's a devastating call... to the Texas sheriff. That's the last thing we want in our jail is not for everybody to come in here and leave here the same way they come in, if not healthier. I got a phone call from a friend of mine who's in the media in Houston. And he said, "Elton, what's going on with this hanging at the jail?" And I said, "Well. We had a hanging at the jail. "As far as I know, the Texas Rangers are handling it, and that's about all I know." "They'll give me a report when they finish it." It got a lot stranger. It was either that afternoon or the next morning, uh, everything hit the proverbial fan. Police say Bland was arrested for resisting arrest and assaulting an officer, but so far the only video of the incident shows Bland on the ground. I don't believe I saw the bystander video until it was released to the public, which was Tuesday. I couldn't understand why she was on the ground with this man's knee in her back. I could not understand that. As a sister, my heart, it hurts. So, of course, when the bystander video comes out, now I have a ton of questions because my mind goes to, okay, what happened before all of that to get her to the point where she's down on the ground... with this guy towering over her. And how do you go from this very strong woman to dead in jail by alleged suicide. He got a hundred percent on that other test, so let him do what he-- he took care of it. Dad, where's the sugar? I'll see what happens. I'll let you know when she--when he lets me know. He said that he's going to talk to her. I love you. Drive safely. My wife and I were in the car, and my wife told me Sandy Bland had passed, and I said, "Sandy Bland? Show me a picture of who you're talking about." She showed me a picture of Sandy, and I mean, you know, your heart kind of stops and you're... you're in shock. Sandy got rear-ended by a motorcycle on the 5th of April, 2015, and she contacted my office. She had a big personality, and it was a big, bright personality. See, I'm assessing people when I talk to them, trying to figure out what type of witness they're going to be. Is she going to be equipped to think on her feet? She was. Sandy died on the 13th of July. And from that next morning when I got a phone call from the family asking whether or not we could get involved, I mean, uh, you felt compelled. On Friday, we got down to Texas, and it's seven o'clock at night. -I'm about to pass out 'cause I'm so hungry. -I know, baby. I know. We were told, once you get here, it will be proven without a doubt. You'll be able to see... that she... contributed in her own... death. The Texas Rangers, they walked us through footage, so they claimed, anyway, of the jail. We were looking, trying to see where Sandy was. I didn't see her ever. The video that we viewed when we went down, it was only for the morning of Monday, July 13th. There's no time stamps, there's no dates. Her cell was all the way in the back corner. She was in cell number 95. The way they choose to phrase it is, where she was did not have cameras. But I would think that that would be strange. Then how are you monitoring your inmates? Why was she in a cell by herself? That's a big cell for one person. And when they were wheeling the gurney out, I went, "Whoa, she's going to be on the gurney, right?" Oh, no. She wasn't on the gurney. She was not on the gurney. And then the lead investigator for the Texas Rangers, Shane Ellison, had told us that specifically Sandy made upwards of 21 phone calls. Yet they tell us they don't know what phones she used to make these 21 calls. That doesn't make sense to me. If you know she made 21 calls, then you've got to know what phones she used to make those calls. And then he also said that when he was called that that triggered a crime investigation, a criminal investigation. So I'm thinking that we're going to see the documentation by way of photographs. They showed us some photographs of her body in the cell. They did not have any photographs that depicted her hanging, and we were told explicitly that they don't exist. And she was hung from a trash bag. The trash bag is the ligature. I thought, where did this woman even get a plastic bag from? When you're booking an inmate, you're stripping them of anything that would put them in a position to harm themselves. You're stripping them of their shoestrings. You're stripping them of their belt. You're stripping them of their earrings. You have a 30-gallon trash can, in an inmate's cell, that gives them access to a plastic bag. If she was in as much pain as she says she was in, I just don't see how she could have tied that perfect, very perfect noose. I know that we were grieving, but... we are a family of note-takers. We take notes of things that were being told to us that just didn't sound right. We view the dashcam video on the 21st, the day before we fly her home, so now I've got a ton of questions. Oh, I have a slew of questions, right? -For what? -..send me another unit. I'm sitting, I'm watching all of these violations occur. -Let's do this. -Yeah, we're going to. That man slapped her. He slapped her, you can hear it. We're going to. He reaches into the car, and you hear a smack, and then you see her head pulling away from him. The reason that the slap is important is because it's a battery. When she's recording him, "Put your phone down." "I have the right to record. This is my property." You tell her to turn around, she doesn't want to turn around. She says, "Why do I have to turn around?" two or three times, but ultimately turns around on her own. Stop it! I felt like, oh, my gosh, if she was treated that way, in public, cars are riding by, she's treated that way, on the road... what was going on in the jail? What was going on in there? When Sandy called me on Saturday, she told me that her bond was $500. And I told her that I had $100 and I would work on getting the rest for her. She knows that I'm gonna come through for her. I just don't see her taking her own life. I just don't see it. Until we have concrete answers, as to the time of her death, and whether or not that death could have been caused, uh, by someone other than her, until we have answers to those sorts of questions, all options are on the table, they have to be. Anytime there's a jail hanging, a jail death, that's treated as a homicide. We're still waiting for a hard copy of the Harris County medical examiner's autopsy, and toxicology will probably be delayed about two weeks. At this point, this is still fresh. We're trying to respect the family and realize that they have a funeral that they need to plan. Ms. Bland's mother is anxious to get her daughter's body back to Illinois. As the lieutenant governor of Texas, yes, I want to be sure, we overturned every stone and looked at every fact. That's important for everyone, but it's most important for that family. -That's right. -I want that family, when they go back to Chicago... for when this is resolved, that they believe, they had justice in Texas. Riding back on a plane... I sent her out of here on four wheels, and now she's coming back, under the plane, with the cargo. Like these planes, she was ascending. She was going, going, and she got to a certain level, plateaued, and then she was gone. I am on the steps, if you can see behind me, of the DuSable Museum. I'm getting ready to walk in, but it's very, very interesting and amazing to know how much black history is truly right here in our own city. Chicago was founded by a man of color: DuSable. There needs to be a statue of that man in the heart of downtown. The first open-heart surgery, performed by Daniel Hale Williams. That was right on the south side of Chicago at Provident Hospital. Y'all, our history is so rich and deep, but it is up to us to find it. Sandy's number four in the pack. And Sandy was a helper. What about like this? Growing up, we didn't have a lot of money. Can you say, "Please, Mommy, please?" My mom had my first sister when she was 15, and... she had all of us by the time she was 25. And then if I get a chance to taste it, I'll taste it. My mother was very strict about education. If we were sick, we had to go to school, it didn't matter. I was called "The Warden." I'm your mom. I'm not your schoolmate. But I don't remember Sandy accepting "no." She knew she wanted to go to college. The HBCUs came to the Chicago-land area, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities. And she happened upon Prairie View, and they gave her a scholarship, a band scholarship. It's a big deal to be a part of a band at an African-American institution. But it also meant doing something that nobody in this family ever did, which was leave home, and go miles away from this very close-knit family... to Texas. We're right on the west side of Houston. And most of our business here is farming, but... here at the sheriff's office, one of our primary focuses is obviously the jail. A county jail, we're not here for punishment. We're here to hold you till you go to court, and then decide what your punishment is. We are that guardian, that, "Okay, we gotta get 'em through this." Sheriff Glenn Smith used to be chief of police in Hempstead. Chief Smith had complaints of racial intimidation. They reprimanded him, they sent him to sensitivity training, and in spite of all of that, he continued to get reports. But, eventually, he won the election to be the sheriff of Waller County. Taking a lot of classes? Prairie View is over-policed. Here's a copy of the warning. You are policed by university campus, city of Prairie View, you're policed by the state troopers, you're policed by the sheriff, Waller County, and the constables. That's five people for this area. This is the same county that me and Sandy marched to vote, in 2008. Because they didn't want the student population to vote, so we wouldn't offset their voting. We're in Texas. It's always been the good old boys system. Good old boys taking care of the good old boys. This county unfortunately goes all the way back to the Civil War, and it is a sensitive topic. Do we have prejudice in this county? Yes. You know. Do we have it across the country? Yes. Sandy had come back from Prairie View initially, and was trying to kind of find herself... doing different jobs, trying to figure out where she fit. Hi, I'm Sandy, and I'm the administrative assistant here at Cook's. Today, I'm going to be talking to you about copolymers and polycarbonates. With Cooks, she found out that one of their biggest accounts was the penitentiary system. And she said, "I can't work for a company that's doing this kind of stuff." The softness of the material is important because it means it will not shatter and it cannot be easily sharpened into a weapon. You find so many meal delivery products... It was in direct conflict with her morals, in terms of mass incarceration of disenfranchised people. After that, she'd had a couple of job opportunities that she didn't get, even though she felt like she did great, so, that would frustrate her sometimes. You've spent four years at a university and wracked up all this debt and you can't find a darn job? In your field? You're not going to be too happy about that. I've been really stressed out over these past couple of weeks, suffering from depression. And I started crying, and in the middle of my tears, in my head, I just heard the song, "God Blocked It." It let me know that everything was going to be okay. It will be okay. God let me know that you have got work to do. I always knew what she was capable of, which was harnessing her voice, being anchored in it. and doing something about things that she just felt wasn't right. -Hold on, hold on, hold on. -Don't touch me. The most recent case of alleged police brutality here... ...their safety and don't feel that they can trust the police officer, and then police officers... Hey, y'all. So... I don't know where to look. And if I'm lookin' a little crazy, it's 'cause this is a test. Um... I wanted to make this video message and plant my seed of "Sandy Speaks." I know my head probably looks a little crazy right now, but, um... with the police brutality and all of the things that have been going on in the news somewhere along the way, we've forgotten about an important group, which are the kids. Um... I don't have any kids. I do have an eight-year-old and a 14-year-old nephew. Sorry, my battery about to die. I ain't even got my cord. Um... Through "Sandy Speaks," we are going to open up a gateway for the kids. Educating them on interacting with police. I don't think it's ever too early. And if you're a cop out there and you're watching this, here is your chance to say something and educate these kids, 'cause again, I'm here to change history. This thing that I'm holding in my hand, this telephone, this camera, it is quite powerful. Social media is powerful. We can do something with this. If we want to change, we can really, truly make it happen. "Sandy Speaks." When she first posted her "Sandy Speaks" on Facebook, I got all these notifications from Sandy. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. That was her channeling that energy. This fight for civil rights, it still goes on right now. Although it's not called civil rights, that is what it is. Your right to be a civilian. We are still in that fight today, so please don't think it's over. 'Cause it's not. You are going to have to stand before God, and he is going to ask you, were you able to show love to your white man. Because that's the ultimate test. I really, I believe that. We are so valuable to this country, to this nation as a whole, but we will never succeed and we will never thrive as a culture, as a country, if we don't wake up. Black-on-black crime numbers are extremely high. These gangbangers and drug dealers, the people that they're shooting are not other gangbangers and drug dealers. They are killing our babies. Why do we keep acting like niggers? Excuse my French. But that is what we keep acting like. She was speaking some real powerful stuff, that some people would not have dare been able to even speak. We have to just stop icing these things over. We have to stop acting like they don't matter. And so Sandy is going to speak whenever I see something wrong. I thank you guys, I love you guys... What she was really saying in her messages, we can no longer be passive about these things. Not somebody has to do something about it. We have to do something about it. She gets a call from Prairie View that there is a job opportunity. It was a temp job. And they said, we need you to be here to do this job interview. Well, at first I was like, "You know, you just left. "You didn't tell us or anything." And she was like, "It was going to be too emotional and I needed to do this, for me." To be successful in this world, you have to know how to work with white people. What "Sandy Speaks" wants to do is let my kings and queens know, you can do it. We can be successful. It is up to us. I'm here! I am in Prairie View, Texas. Back at the crib. See the sign for PVAMU right there. I'm home! Exiting 10-98 now. Welcome back. Oh, Lord. I'm about to go over Waller County line. Hi Mommy, it's me. Just wanted to let you know that I made it, I am here! I am here. Call me when you get a chance. Love you. Bye-bye. When I got to my house, she was already in the driveway. Said, "Interview at one o'clock." So she went in, she changed, she showered. She said, "How do I look?" I said, "You look like you're about to get a job." Today, y'all, we're going to talk about hair. I don't know if many of y'all saw my post about how ready I am for my locks, but if you could see, yeah, I got my natural back. My fellow kings and queens always find something to laugh or poke fun about it, but, baby, under that edge-up, you got naps. Sweetie pie, under that Brazilian, you got naps. Before you get that perm, you have naps. So let's just cut it out. Let's stop hatin' on people 'cause their hair's natural. It's only hair. Okay? I love y'all. Friday, Sandy just called to say, "Hey, I got it." I'm about to start in a few days. I got it, Mom!" She was going to work, but then she was also going to work on her master's in political science. She goes, "I'm going to the grocery store, and I'll talk to you later." I text her and I say, "Watch out, Prairie View. Werk it, girl." Friday afternoon, tables turned. Everything's different. That night, about 10 o'clock, my phone rings, and I look at it on the caller ID and it said Waller County Sheriff's Department. And of course, I answer the phone. And it was Sandra Bland, and she was upset. Not crying, upset 'cause of what happened, she was pissed because of what happened. The main charge that she come in here with was assault on a public servant. And Ms. Bland, unfortunately, had a past criminal record. It was minor charges, a small amount of marijuana, maybe. But the current charge of a felony put her just in that different category. But I'm a country sheriff. I'm a conservative. By God, don't go violating the law or we're gonna get you. And you should be punished if you're found guilty. I mean, that's me. Hey, this is me. I'm, um... I just was able to see the judge. I don't really know, they got me sitting in a $5,000 bond. I'm still just at a loss for words, honestly, about this whole process. How this switching lanes with no signal turned into all of this, I don't even know. Um, but I'm still here. So, I guess call me back when you can. Ms. Bland's bond was set at $5,000. But most bondsmen here charge about 10 percent. So basically, it'd have been about 500. She called me from the jail. She didn't have any money, what she said. And I said, "Well, you got somebody that can help you, or I need to call?" I called her sister, and her sister said, "I had told Sandra all I had was..." I think she said a hundred, and "My rent's due," blah, blah, blah. So the next person called me after that was her mom. I say, "Okay. I'm going to get with the rest of the family, and we'll get back with you." There was no sense of, Oh, Jesus, I gotta jump down here, go on a plane and go do this right now. No. The main thing for us was, she said, "I'm gonna call you back." And the next phone call I got from the family was that Monday afternoon, when her mom called me and said, uh... "Mr. Booker, they said my daughter's in the morgue," and that was it. We were very upset and saddened by it, but at the same time, myself and Elton Mathis we were bound and determined to make sure whatever the process was, that it would be open and transparent from the beginning till the end. The truth is, it was not the authorities that called me. I'm the mom. There was never a phone call from Waller County about Sandy's death. When someone told me that Sandy hung herself, it was like this overwhelming feeling of oppression. Right, 'cause the thing that happened with the kids in Texas, where they were body-slammed at the pool party had just happened. Get down! Down! There was so much unrest in the country, and this is not just happening on TV, and it's happening to someone who you knew. None of that made sense about who she was, the type of person she was, the type of fighter that she was. Good morning, my beautiful kings and queens. If you could see my poster, here, "All white people are not against us." -So call the police. -Okay. All right. Go ahead. Go right ahead. All right. Y'all see it. The police are about to get called. "Sandy Speaks." Game is on. When the video came out, I was enraged. That she would go into a jail and cower away and kill herself made no sense to me. Something was not right. I just kept posting articles and information and trying to get people out there, and like, Sandra Bland. Say her name, say her name. Prairie View alumni kept tweeting and tweeting and Instagram-ing and Facebook-ing and hashtag-ing her name everywhere. Hello, this is Hannah Bonner. I'm here at the Waller County Jail. When Sandra died, we had not seen a woman's name have that staying power that we had seen with Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin. Women had died, but we had not continued to say their names. So she died on Monday, and by Wednesday night I was at the jail. And we lit a candle that had the hashtag: What Happened to Sandra Bland. And so somebody from inside the jail blew the candle out. You have a responsibility to serve and protect me. -No, I don't. -Oh. Oh! -You don't? -You don't want me to. Then we started projecting onto the wall of the jail. I was asked, was I trying to racially unite or racially incite. Well, honestly, I feel that my goal is to racially unite. Now... in the process of doing that, some people will be incited, i.e. upset, because based on the history of America, it is not good when it comes to black and white people. Sandra Bland didn't have to be here. America allowed this to happen. Because these idiots, these Europeans have miseducated our people. -Too black, too strong! -Too black, too strong! -Too black, too strong! -Too black, too strong! -All power to the people! -All power to the people! -All power to the people! -All power to the people! -Too black, too strong! -Too black, too strong! -No more pigs in my community! -Off the pig! -No more pigs in my community! -Off the pig! -Revolution has come! -Off the pig! -No more sisters in jail! -Off the pig! -Pigs are going to catch hell! -Off the pig! -Oink, oink! -Oink, oink! Panther patch, it says, "Freedom or death!" And we mean it till our last breath! And we mean it till our last breath! -Whose streets? -Our streets! -Whose streets? -Our streets! We're back in Chicago. Sandy is back in Chicago, and we're preparing to bury her. We're burying her on Saturday. And my first text that I receive from Mr. Mathis, the district attorney down there, he says to me at 4:58, "Where is the body? "Do you have the results back on your autopsy?" I say in response, "Sandy is here with us. We haven't received our report yet." So this is part of what makes me start to feel like there's a little gamesmanship that's going on because he knows that I can't have a full autopsy report. He then says, "Looking at the autopsy results and toxicology, "it appears that she may have swallowed a large quantity of marijuana or smoked it in jail. "Since your client has possession of Ms. Bland's body, "I must ask it not be disturbed any more than necessary "and that a proper chain of custody be kept, so that she will be available "for future examination by qualified experts. Notice is given at 5:10 p.m." That "notice is given at 5:10 p.m." is a specific effort to try and shift the burden as it relates to the destruction of evidence on this family when they know that they're about to bury her. You don't release a body if there's more tests that you need on that body. Do you think that's enough to cover some? I mean-- You're not only going to be asking what the policies, procedures, protocols, and guidelines are, but you're also going to say, -"as it relates to booking." -That makes sense. Perfect. When you start to deal with, frankly, deception, we could potentially file a lawsuit, if we wanted to, down there, in Waller County. You file a suit so you can make people give you the information that the family is entitled to. I mean, for Christ's sakes she died in their custody. We were able to get access to Sandra Bland's cell. You can see they've left a lot of it just like the way it was. The food is still sitting here. The bed is still in the same arrangement that it was left in. But there's a lot of attention being paid to the trash bag just like this one. And this trash liner. Of course, this trash liner is what's believed that was used to string up here, and for Sandra Bland to hang herself. There were reporters, as we know, go into the cell, in its state that it was claimed to have been in at the time that Sandy passed. And that says that is not being preserved. It just blows my mind that that could have happened, but it did. Eighteen years ago, a single parent brought five little girls to this church. And Sandra Bland was one of our victories. Before she was formed... God spoke into her spirit. "Now I'm sending you into a strange land. "All of the authorities are not fair. "All of the politicians are not honest. "And I'm sending you, Sandy Bland-- that's what they're going to name you-- I'm sending you not to shut up, but to speak up." And here came Sandy. "Good morning, my kings and queens. "I'm not a racist. I don't believe in violence. "I'm not trying to incite. "I'm trying to unite. "Sandy Speaks." As a matter of fact... ...when I think of Sandy Bland, I'm going to think of more than an outspoken, strong-willed black woman. But I'm going to think of Jesus! Oh, yes I am! 'Cause don't you know, Sandy was raised in a blended family. Like Jesus, she was brutally arrested. Like Jesus, she died in the custody of authority. Like Jesus, Sandy's still speaking. Are you listening? Are you listening? I lost my best friend and my sister. And I know that the closure that I need will not come until the legal process is complete. I assembled a team of special prosecutors. Two African-American special prosecutors, a female prosecutor, Anglo, and two male Anglo prosecutors, all of which were actually defense attorneys-- people that would traditionally be antagonistic toward law enforcement, to come in and review what happened to Sandy in that jail. The saying is that a prosecutor can use a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich. Basically, whatever result the prosecutor wants to see come out of the grand jury, they can manipulate the evidence to secure. I disagree with the old statement that you can indict a ham sandwich. My grand jurors have always been smarter than that. And my grand jurors don't just let me come in and do whatever I want. I think it's a... a farce, the criminal investigation. I bet you money that the DA down there, they'll say, "All of the evidence that we presented to the grand jury was assessed, "and they made a determination that nobody should be charged." But the practical reality of a grand jury investigation is that it's not adversarial. I can't be there, I don't get to submit any evidence. They get to choose what evidence they submit and what evidence they don't. They may not choose to submit any of the dashcam video if they investigate Encinia. They get to say, "Sandy was pulled over because she failed to use her turn signal. "She got aggressive, and she had to be arrested." And there's no way for us to know whether or not that's all the evidence they really give. Why? Because it's a secret proceeding. It's a secret proceeding that no one will ever be able to access. In two miles take Exit 2, -79A for US... to US-20... -Oh! -...US-45 La Grange Road. -Okay. This is in Maryland, they have a mobile billboard that says "Department of Justice, Launch an Investigation. Justice for Sandra Bland." That was on the side of someone's truck. I feel like a large part of the world has glossed over the stop, and they just talk about how she got in jail and what may have happened in jail. When you terminate someone, you are letting them know that you have broken protocol. and you have put us as an organization at risk. And so why that hasn't happened with Officer Encinia, I don't know. I mean, your emotions are too raw to even come to a grave and visit anybody. So the last couple of weeks, I mean, she was-- even though she passed away on the 13th, she wasn't buried until the 25th. Authorities say Bland had drugs in her system at the time of her death. There have been some instances or claims about a substantial amount of marijuana found in her system. I can tell you that there has been a confirmation of those results. One thing was pretty certain was that she had a substantial amount of marijuana in her body. To me it was interesting fact, because it plays on her psyche, it plays onto why she may have been suicidal and why nobody knew about it. What they've tried to suggest, by marijuana, is a crock, is a crock of manure. And it was a direct attack on her character. Sandra Bland was very combative. -What does that mean? -It was, um... It was not a model traffic stop, or--and it was not a model person that was stopped on a traffic stop. We went to the auto shop, where the car was. This is the purse that she had in the car. We also found the cigarette that she was asked to put out. And she put it out. The area where you put out a cigarette, it was sticking, standing straight up. So even though she said, "I don't have to put it out," she put it out. And even in spite of that, she was still made to get out of the car. "Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who lose it, will eat its fruit." Man, that is a word. Hmm. How did Sandy die? Well, now we're trying to say, "Oh! "Let's not look at what really happened. Let's talk about this marijuana that was in her system." And so now she changes from the poor young lady who passed in a jail cell to "Oh, she was crazy. She had a mental illness." You can throw all of the... insults, you can throw all of what you want to throw, I'm still going to stand until everything is uncovered. Bland's autopsy has been completed... I'm going to have the press conference tomorrow morning at nine. I mean, we're going to get up there and we're going say, "We've made the decision at this time, necessary for us to file suit." "Why now? The reason we're suing now is, they're making us file. We've asked for the same information that the media's released. Right? They're giving it piecemeal to the media in a way that helps them. We're forced to litigate this because we have an in-custody death that's unexplained. We're not getting information. We need to know the true time of death. Was it on the 13th? Was it the 12th? Was the rigor mortis set in? All of those things are unknown. The doctor that did our independent autopsy does not have the gastric content, because that's still in their possession. She doesn't have the ligature, that's still in their possession. And then try to spin it back to the arrest. -What do you think? -Police officers know where the video is. So at the point where she's not in the video, the police officer did something else to her. Obviously, she wouldn't just say, "You're breaking my wrist..." -Correct, correct. -...outside the scope of the camera. -Okay, they know exactly where it is. -Mm-hmm So that's kind of how we frame it. That they're trained to go outside of the view of the camera. -Yeah. -Mm-hmm. Okay. Rangers are our friends. They are really good at coming in and taking care of issues like this. I don't think that there's ever been an issue like this. When I sent my family down here, they were supposed to be coming back with Sandy's items. They were supposed to-- we were told we could get her phone, we were told we could get all of that. And when they got here, that totally flipped around. And so, now... we gotta do what we have to do. The family of Sandra Bland will be filing suit on August 4, 2015, uh, at the federal courthouse, Houston. -Have a nice day. -Thank you. You know that they say, don't mess with Texas? But we're down here to mess with Texas. Or they got the message. We sued Waller County sheriff, Brian Encinia. We sued both of the booking officers at Waller County. There's the assault and battery counts, there's the wrongful death count, there's the survival count. There were constitutional rights that were violated. People in this country have died for the opportunity to make sure that we have a voice at this point. And we're going to muster the strength to use it. And when you file suit, you're saying, this wasn't right. And you might be, quote, "the man," you might be, quote, "the system," but we feel like something's got to change. Folks, thanks very much for coming. We, in filing this lawsuit, are looking to hold those who are responsible for the stop, and Sandy's ultimate death, accountable. This is a homicide or a suicide? This family is a reasonable family. In the face of Sandy being the light that she was, it is very difficult for them to get their minds around the notion that she would hurt herself. What happened to Sandy is indicative of a larger conversation. How does Sandra Bland's story play into that larger narrative? If, ultimately, the answer to your question is, unfortunately, that Sandy took her own life, does that at all change? She should not have been there in the first place. The fact that she was pulled over for a failure to signal a lane change, okay, the fact that she honestly and was forthcoming and complying with the police officer when he asked her for her identification. That's what he asked her for. The other ask of her, and where his tone changed was when he asked her to put her cigarette out. To which she replied, "I don't have to put my cigarette out, "I'm in my own vehicle." There's a seismic shift in the conversation that takes place there. It's unfortunate, and I think that the key word to remember here is the inability to de-escalate the situation. The fact that the situation escalated in such a way that we have a young lady who was merely on her way to get groceries, on her way to get groceries to stock her refrigerator, on a Friday afternoon, she ends up jailed, she ends up dying in police custody. We are three weeks out from Sandra's death. We are a week out from burying her, and we still don't know what happened to her. You can't have somebody who speaks this message... -That's right. That's right. -...that is suicidal. -No way. -No way. -Say her name! -Sandra Bland! -Say her name! -Sandra Bland! -Say her name! -Sandra Bland! -Say her name! -Sandra Bland! The local sheriff, shedding new light on their statement that Sandra Bland committed suicide. Releasing this intake form from the day Bland was jailed, She attempted suicide within the last year. Are you thinking about killing yourself today? Sandra answering no. I can understand where she was probably scared. She was likely going to lose her job at her alma mater, that she had just gotten, because now, she picked up a felony. She had lost a baby 14 months prior. "I'm in a new location, far away from my family." They knew what her bond was. She wasn't being bonded out. She's sitting there thinking about, what am I going to do. She come in here Friday afternoon, as an aggravated, upset individual that probably any of us would have been. You got a concrete floor, concrete walls, and a solid iron door. Your physical body with a high level of THC is working. And by Monday morning, your world has-- in your mind, your world has ended. Suicide is extremely tough. I can't imagine what her family has gone through. I, too, have had close family members that have taken their life and it's hard to understand. Did she want to do that in completion, or did she do it by accident, wanting to be, maybe caught, for extra attention? Those things, you know, none of us would ever know. I was there for the miscarriage. I was at the hospital with her and everything, and she was, she was sad. But I was not knowledgeable of any suicide attempt. Sharon called. She said, "They're saying that she committed suicide." And that just wasn't the Sandy that I knew. About a month before the unfortunate incident, she had said, "Reverend Brazier, I think I got my purpose. I think I know what I want to do." She came out from under the table with this... it was a binder, about an inch and a half, two inches thick, of all this research that she had done on police brutality. Body cams, Trayvon Martin, you know, legislation. My job has become, helping wherever I can. Inspired by the Million Man March, there was the creation of the National African-American parent involvement... Racism is still alive today, and it still... All the odds are against us. In Ferguson, there were two gentlemen who decided to disrupt a peaceful protest and shoot into the crowd. Y'all, this has got to stop. When you see somebody who is such an advocate for the people coming behind her, it is very difficult to understand why she would decide to kill herself. -We have a job to do. -That just does not jive. You got to conquer hate with love. Where somebody is being racist... Let's get to work. I'm ready. What about you? I knew instantly that it was a cover-up. because I know that that wasn't in her character. I had talked to her, I had seen her. And if you know Sandra Bland, you know, she's had much harder times than sitting in jail for three days. In 2009, Sandra was charged with possession of marijuana. It was a personal use amount, but we ended up getting that case dismissed. In 2010, she was arrested for DWI, as well as possession of marijuana, again. Thirty-six. In lieu of paying the ticket because you can't afford it, they'll let you sit the ticket out in jail. They charge X amount of dollars per day, and when you get to whatever that amount is, they release you. Sandy went to Harris County and sat for 30 days. And then she came to Waller and sat out two weeks. She knew that was her responsibility and wanted to take care of it. There are uneducated people who are hellbent on self-extermination. I am not one of them. I am into building up my kings and queens. So for me, black lives matter. And then, subset, all lives matter. It is not okay that we have to create a hashtag, "If I die in police custody." Black lives matter! Black lives matter! It went from sadness to utter frustration. What I saw was an incredible amount of misinformation. And it just kept on, kind of, getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And then you started to see things that were outright lies. Sandra's done with her mugshots. I believe... that the best way to get away with murdering her was to stage the entire booking. When she is allegedly brought out of the holding cell to have her mugshot taken, her face is blurred out through the entire segment. One of the most heavily discussed pieces of evidence is Bland's mugshot. Many are postulating that she was already dead when her photo was taken by police. When getting a mugshot taken, prisoners are told not to lean on the wall behind them. See that? He's wearing gloves. All these videos that were being put out on YouTube, going through step-by-step about how she was deceased before she even got to the jail, You can clearly see in this image that Sandra was flat against the supposed wall behind her. Then that's when you started to see where we were receiving the death threats. People wanting to kill me, kill the sheriff. I completely understand why there are groups of people that think we killed that girl. Because we're in the South, maybe because we talk a little slower. Got this big, white, Bubba-looking guy, that he must be a racist, he must not like black people. Um... He can't be trusted to get justice for Sandy. Now this is a perfect storm for the country to be divided and angry. -Back up! Back up! -We've still got some people inside! Let them out! Let them out! -Open the door! -Let them out! Let them out! Let them out! Let them out! Let them out! Sandy still speaks! -Let's go! -Sandy still speaks! -Let's go! -Sandy still speaks! -Let's go! -Sandy still speaks! On the other side of the wall is our 9-1-1 dispatchers who are receiving emergency calls, and then you have a group of people with bullhorns. Our 911 dispatchers couldn't even hear the phone calls. We had to get those people to vacate the front lobby. I spent several nights here, at the office, on my couch because I was not gonna leave here with employees, knowing they've got to be here all night. Sandy's still speaking out! Y'all killed her! Which one of you two white boys went back there and do it? We saw the video. -Come on. -Hey! Get off of me! If there's anybody left in there... You had the whole country looking at what was going on... with law enforcement under attack, with our past. We need to just calm the hell down, and we need to start looking at what happened, and not what we think happened. And more importantly... not what we want to have happened. No! We're doing it! This is from the homecoming, from fall, 2014. This picture is from this year. A month and a half before she passed away. This is from a family dinner this year. This had to have been within the last year and a half, because my daughter must have been one and a half, here. This is actually from last summer. Now, Cannon is heavily involved. Life has changed in a blink of an eye. One moment we went from being as a family, to at any given moment, Cannon was gone, and I didn't know when Cannon was coming back. Death threats left on his phone. Worrying for the kids' and my safety. Yes, uh, Mr. Lambert, I do have psychic abilities. There's going to be an attempt made on your life this week. You're delving into what's called the Code of Silence. And it isn't only in the Chicago Police Department. It's especially true in, uh, the state of Texas. They always have a problem with, uh, Afro-Americans who are so-called social activists. Please be very careful, Mr. Lambert. The thing that really stuck out to me when I read this motion was that, it says, "It is apparent now, "that Bland's inability to secure her release from jail, "and her family and friends' refusal to bail her out of jail, led her to commit suicide." Um, you're not just blaming the victim, you're blaming the family. We know that she was able to make contact with her family. They knew that she needed to be bonded out. And Mr. Booker, the bondsman, he's got pretty much 24-hour access to the jail. So, once your bond is set, he can go in there and get somebody out pretty much whenever he wants. They find out, in the early evening on Saturday, and by Sunday night, they're ready to get her out. They called the next morning, on Monday morning, and she was gone. A day and a half transpired, that's not a lot of time. It's just not. I know why they're trying to make it out to be. How do you file that type of proceeding and, uh, by the way, you've not even deposed the people you are claiming are responsible. You've never spoken to them. You don't know what's in their minds. What about you, Waller County? What about you, jailers? What about you not paying attention to where she was at, what she was doing, how she was feeling? You know, you can't orchestrate the frustration, and you can't control the desire to see change. This is the New York City Police Department. -Please be advised... -What's her name? -Say her name! -Sandra Bland! We're in a state of war right now! This is war! United we stand! -We're doing this for Sandra Bland! -United we stand! -We're doing this for Sandra Bland! -Sandra Bland! Sandra Bland! -Sandra Bland! -Say her name! -Sandra Bland! -Say her name! -Sandra Bland! -Say her name! -Sandra Bland! Won't you say her name! -Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! Say her name! The autopsy is, you know, our investigative tool. So you have to be thinking forward. She did have a well-formed ligature mark which had a V behind her left ear. And that's the point of suspension. It appears that she was not hanging but perhaps seated with her head forward, which is not uncommon. As the blood flow decreases, then you really get sleepy. Is there any indication at all that there could have been some foul play? Are you in a place where you can render an opinion right now? You have real injuries that could not have resulted from a hanging, but from blunt force being applied to the back of the body. She had scrapes on her upper right side of her back. And yet there is no tissue that is labeled soft tissue from the back. Questions are still there. I have to go through everything before I render an an opinion. The Waller County grand jury, as of about 3:30 today, has issued an indictment against State Trooper Brian Encinia for perjury. Is that the only charge he's facing? That's the only charge that the grand jury issued an indictment on. The indictment was issued in reference to the reason that he removed her from her vehicle. It is a class A misdemeanor, excuse me, up to a year in jail and up to a $4,000 fine. I can't even... I can't even fucking feel my arm! This guy's gonna get the minimal slap on the wrist for the initial lie that put my daughter behind bars. Here's a guy who should have clearly been charged with assault, battery. And I'm going to tell you that I can say, "At least we got a perjury charge"? No. My white friends, don't get upset, but I'm going to call out racism wherever I see it. So for you who can say, "Oh, the law doesn't see color," it doesn't see color 'cause you ain't got no color in your skin. You just don't know. You don't know racism because you don't live it. You don't feel it. What you may see as just somebody doing their job, we see the undertones of that. We've been trained to see them, because we live them every day. Okay, I don't see anything wrong with the officer's actions until we get to the point where he asks her to put the cigarette out. She very accurately pointed out that she didn't have to put out a cigarette. This is a perfect example of exactly how vulnerable black women are in public space to law enforcement. -He baited her, you know he did. -She had a problem-- She had a problem with being stopped, she didn't like the fact that she was being stopped, her whole arrogant attitude, and that stop. The officer should not have pulled her over-- Hang on. Listen! I wan't everybody to listen. Because I think-- Mark! Hang on, Mark! Harry is calling arrogance, I'm calling dignity. Black people have a right to assert their dignity in public, and just because it doesn't cohere with what police want... Let's just talk about why we're here a little bit. Um, as you all know, Dr. Carter was retained to do a private, preliminary evaluation of Sandy's body, and come up with some preliminary findings, at this point, give you a chance to ask questions, with the understanding that this is our confidential conversation, and that what you find out here, you don't share. There are certain things that we look for in forensics to give us the ability to say when the death occurred. And, uh, you have a short window to document those things. The primary one is getting a core body temperature, which was not done. And that's what's lost. And so at that point, Dr. Carter, when we called you in, you can't... No, I can only go back so far, because by that time, refrigeration has taken place, the body has been moved. The largest amount of marijuana that shows is what we call THC-COOH, or carboxylated, and that means it's metabolized. It hangs around the body for forever. It is not a whopping amount of drug. It was just nonsense. And so that was just completely out of bounds. Um, there were no fractures, but I found evidence of deep bruising. Bruising going all the way through the deep muscles on... on the back, uh, down to the level of the ribs. So if someone has put their knee into a back, and they're grinding, that's going to actually destroy the small vessels in the muscular tissue. Just let us know if you need a break, okay? We want to try to make sure everybody's getting the same information at the same time. If you need to step out, it's okay. Go ahead, Shavon. You have a question? With that kind of scarring going to the ribs, would it be complicated for her to breathe, necessarily? It would have been painful. She would have been in pain. I mean, I've had that type of pain, and so, I... I'm just trying to, you know, process everything. It's not really adding up to me. I wanted to rule out foul play occurring, consistent with, with hands placed on. I did examine the hyoid bone, it was not fractured. We generally see that when we have homicidal strangulation, where someone has their hands around the neck. That was not present here. Correct me if I'm wrong, with homicidal death, you see things like defensive wounds, you see things like impressions in the skin... You didn't find any of those physical findings. So we have these open questions, still. Will you be able to dust for fingerprints, or have we missed that window? That should have been done, but we don't know that they did. We asked that question and I was told that they hadn't done that. There is a lot of significant and vital information that is missing. The bruising on her back and on her legs, I mean, yeah, he was on her back for a significant amount of time when she was arrested, but I mean, I don't know. It's just, it could have happened while she was sleeping. It could have happened while she was laying down her, I mean, I just... -Sure. -There's a lot of things that are just... that just does not add up. As lawyers looking at this, we have to approach, um, all possibilities and probabilities. My question is what led to this point. I have ruled out a homicidal hanging. It's not suggestive of that at all. But I think this is something-- You're supposed to be face-to-face once an hour, not looking through a window and guessing. This young woman is scared and frightened and someone is having emotional pain, physical pain, isolated, then you have some things that should be considered as being driven to. You know, we know that someone's spirit can be broken, even in a short period of time. So sorry for your loss. -Thank you. -Thank you. The grand jury was released from the courtroom just a few minutes ago. They just came out. They are done. Everyone was cleared of wrongdoing at the Waller County Jail where Bland died in custody. Her death was ruled a suicide, -her protesters don't believe it. -They have... And we just need to let the court system work. I'm sitting there and I'm going, "Wow. Really?" Because I'm just mad because my daughter is gone. It made me want to get up, even more, because the truth has got to come out. To be a strong African-American woman... I imagine they were just so irritated with her knowledge and her education. And just... they got... they got pissed. The jail has a policy that if you bring an inmate in and you deem them to be a threat or aggressive or what have you, you isolate them initially and then you reevaluate them within a 24-hour period. We know that that didn't happen for Sandy because she was there by herself for three days. She's not combative, she's not aggressive. Why single her out? I am here today because last Monday, I read that the grand jury refused to indict anyone connected to the death of Sandra Bland. I am here today because justice was not served. I'm here today to grieve the loss of not just one black life, but several, whose lives were cut short because of injustice. I'm here to remember Freddie Gray, to grieve Tamir Rice, Karin Smith, Michael Brown, Roshad McIntosh, Tanisha Anderson, and many others. As a white woman living in America, I knew that what happened to Sandra would not happen to me. I would not be threatened with a Taser. I would not be taken into custody. Regardless of if she had a cigarette, regardless of whether she cursed, I believe Office Encinia would not have pulled Sandra Bland from her car if she looked like me. Therefore, racism killed Sandra Bland. The reason Sandy was taken to jail was Brian Encinia's allegations that she assaulted him. That's how Sandra was placed in solitary confinement. It's because she was the only woman in the jail at that time, that came under that classification that put her there. And the reason there's no photograph of Sandy hanging in the jail is because when the jail found her hanging, the first thing they did was get her down and try to bring her back to life. In that situation, it would be a pretty cruel and callous thing for a person to do to, "Let's take a photo of the person hanging, and then let's try to see if we can save them." Larry and I looked at this, and we went back and forth trying to figure out if there's something that we're missing, and we just can't see that we're missing anything. So these are the hourly observation logs from Waller County, and this is on the 13th of July, the day that she was found. That's the sequence that the paperwork's coming in at. So seven o'clock in the morning, at 7:05 they're representing her to be there. And then 8:01, 8:54. Now remember, they're checking on her, right? And she's found at 8:00-- Well, she's purportedly found at 8:54. So that's when they find her. Then we see these other logs at 9:47. And then there's a blank. And then at 11:13, and then there's a series of blanks, all following. It doesn't make any sense to me. The jail logs were filled out in a way that... should not have been filled out. They were turned in... with false information. What that jailer was doing was pre-filling out the form. Did he falsify? No. Not in his mind. So, the truth is, he, the person that signed that jail log, did not see Sandy. They did not check on her that hour. That is a false record. Was it made intentionally, or knowingly, or with evil intent? According to what he says, no. Sandy was bold, and knew exactly what was right and what was wrong. I don't believe Sandy shut her mouth when she got to the that jail. I believe she kept talking, I believe she let them know, I'll see you guys in court. I believe she did all of it. And I believe they silenced her. So no. It's not settled. And no, I don't believe she committed suicide. Still. When we start talking about how different this case is, and if it's different, I think we approach it differently. You know, Freddie Gray was a settlement. You know, Garner was a settlement. Tamir Rice was a settlement. DuBois was a settlement. Everything's been settling for at least 5 million to 10 million dollars. They're going to argue that those were homicides that were caught in video as opposed to a suicide, which we can't prove to the contrary. The only thing that you can go to verdict on is a suicide. And I started thinking about what it would mean if we tried the case. Well, Geneva didn't believe that this was a suicide, and doesn't believe it right now. But I watched over 130 hours worth of video, and you don't see anybody go into her cell, or come out of her cell. Even though we know that this was extremely, extremely mysterious in terms of the circumstances surrounding this case. She was hung from a trash bag. Well, the problem with that trash bag is, is that it didn't have her fingerprints on it. In fact, it didn't have anybody's fingerprints on it. In fact, it didn't even have her DNA on it. We know there's a bunch of evidence that's out there that we'll never have any ability to grab or touch. It's lost. But ultimately, I don't look at it from the standpoint of whether or not it was a suicide or whether or not it was a murder. It was an in-custody death. Sandy should be here, period. There have been 816 deaths, in custody since Sandy's death. One year. What if we say to them that we are looking to see cameras installed throughout the jail? Your Waller County report says what it's going to cost you to do the changes. It's roughly 20 million, in your facility. You know what, Mother Reed-Veal... There's no amount of money that you could put on your child. And so at some point you have to not torture yourself and say, "What happened?" So I decided I'm going to go from what happened, to what happens now. It was the most unnerving thing you ever want to see. Going back and forth, back and forth. Mediator coming into the room, leaving back out. "No, we're not going for that. Yes, no, yes, no." Eight hours. I'm okay. The world will never forget Sandra Bland. Best... family... in the world. And there's going to be changes that come from this, long-standing changes that come from this. It's time to walk your talk now. Young people, don't let Sandy's death be in vain. I am looking at all of you and you are here not by coincidence. The baby said before she left here she was going to go international. She was going to make history. So now you have Sandy Bland Parkway. Look it up on Google. And it's going to take a whole lot more of us standing up and saying "We are not buying it," in order for this to stop. It's tough to hear that from a mother, which makes me fight even harder to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Even when the truth is against the organization... that you served. Police officers around the country, you need to hear my voice. Tell the freakin' truth. Do I think the legal operation of this jail have anything to do with her death? No. No, I don't. The moral responsibility at eight o'clock, if you'd have gone back there in person maybe looked at her eyes and seen, "Hey, something's going on with her, "a little different. "She's stressing," uh... moral responsibility-wise, absolutely. It's not a black versus white issue. No, we didn't go back there and tie a bag around her neck. But it is our responsibility to take care of her. And that, with her and her family, we let her down. Could there have been something we could have done to prevent it? I'll always think that. I'm never going to make everybody in Chicago believe what I'm saying. Or New York City. But this is the little corner of the earth where God's put me. And if I, as the district attorney, don't step back and say, "Hey, Elton, what do you need to do differently, do you have any racist tendencies in you..." then I can't help anybody else. Good morning, my beautiful kings and queens. You know, racism is still only alive because people keep perpetuating it. White and black. Enough people don't have friends of a different race. Black people included. We don't have enough white friends, they don't have enough black friends. For those who don't agree with the things that I'm saying, I apologize. But I'm not going to stop. This is about educating you. That is my goal. We need to educate each other. That's the only way this is going to work. We love you... and your sister wants to play a song for you. I see you, girl. So my peeps, I love you. I'm headed into work. Hoping you all have the same great, prosperous days. Go out there, be great. Do something that you love. "Sandy Speaks."
