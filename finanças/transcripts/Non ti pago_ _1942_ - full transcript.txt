I WON'T PAY YOU! THE LOTTO BANK 17 and 22, and? - 18 for all. - The usual 2 lire. - Yes. You said 64, and that's what I wrote. - I said 74. Shall we cancel it then? - No, since you put 64, leave 64. Put 64 and 74 on all the wheels. But the winning ones! 3 lire on Naples. - No. Only 5 or 10 lire here. 3 lire with the hunchback. Carmela's grandson swallowed a button. - What do I care? No, I want to know what numbers to play. - Dunno. Ask Don Ferdinando. Don Ferdina', what number should be played when a boy swallows a button? What kind of button? - Big as this. No, was it wooden, bone, iron? - Why? Does that matter? - Of course. For wooden: 26. Bone: 38. Iron: 42. Has he done it again? - No. If he does, play 24. Or else purge him. - OK. Bertolini! What are you doing? - It's 7, I'm leaving. As long as there's business, you stay. - There are enough for the few people left. Tell me, young man, why do I pay you? - Yes, why do you pay me? I'm asking you. Why do I pay you? - To serve you always and do my duty. My time ends at 7 and I leave. - As long as there are people, you stay. Ah, no, Don Ferdina', sorry, you are the owner so you can do that. Not me, I'm a just a simple employee. A cigarette? - No. Don Ferdina', you don't like me. Indeed, you can't stand me. That's not fair, as I adore you in my thoughts. I've worked in the Lotto Bank when your father was alive. So you found your bread buttered on. - No, bread and butter? Don't say that. How's that? With my work I was able to get myself tailored silk shirts, a blue suit for special occasions, flannel trousers, a watch with a gold chain. Yes, it's true, every Saturday, I'd guess a pair, the second draw... A jackpot or a sequence. - And you always guess! What can you do? Fortune loves me. It's probably the holy soul of mama, the holy souls of papa, grandpa, grandma who from the beyond, protect me. Know what I'm going to do? Go home, eat dinner and then go to the movies. When I get back, some anisette cookies and liqueur! And that's every Friday night. - Why? Because at night I'm restless, and I dream of the winning numbers. Last Saturday, I won 300 lire on the Bari wheel. - Another 300 lire! I bought myself a nice golden bracelet. Look. You like it? - Yeah, cute. Won't you look at it? - It's nice. May I, Don Ferdina'? - Please. - Until tomorrow. - Go. And love me. - Go. Go! I can't stand him! Good evening! - Evening! - Give him two sure numbers. To whom? - To Don Ferdinando. He's cranky! - Cranky? So many poor people, so many unfortunate fathers of families get run over by trams but never him! Who are you mad at? - I know who! Here's the receipts and your hat. Can I close up? - Yes. Do you need anything, Don Ferdinando? - No, thanks. - Good evening. - Evening. When the kind soul of my father took him into our Lotto Bank, he didn't have shoes on his feet. A deadbeat! Maestro, can you help me? He began to play. And since then, he wins the pairs, second draws, jackpots, sequences! Bit by bit, he got a wardrobe and rigged himself out. With the winnings from my Lotto Bank, he paid off his debts, bought suits, linen! There. Will you close? Yeah, I will. - Here's the keys. - Gimme. - Goodbye. You see, Maestro, this was my house. Two years ago, after my father died, I left it as it made me uneasy. He won a 3,000 triple and rented it. Then he won another 1,500 and made refurbishments, renovations. One time he dreamt of his father, another time his mother, his brothers, his sisters, his nephews and nieces, his cousins, his in-laws! His whole family is dead. He destroyed them! He's the only one left alive. Anisette cookies and liqueur! You hear that, Maestro? A gramophone! He bought a gramophone. "One fine day, we'll see..." I wish I could see that day! Let's go. Don Ferdina'! - What? Don Ferdina', just the man! Want to come up? I've a nice surprise. A surprise? - I want to show you something you deeply cherish. - Me? I want to see what this jerk wants. Come with me. Come in, Don Ferdinando. Make yourself at home. Make yourself at home, Don Ferdinando. What an honor! Do come in. What's more, you know the house well! You lived so many years here. Come in, Maestro. So you renovated all of it? - You don't recognize it, eh? Yes, I spent some money, made some improvements. It needed it, it really did! You remember how it was before. - How was it? Too drab for a young man. Too old fashioned. Why, they play the tarantella here now? I'm not boasting but everything now is modern, 20th century. Bathroom, heater, refrigerator. - Really? You see this portable bar? This is from a pair. Nice, eh? And this outfit? From a jackpot three months ago. That one is from a recent jackpot! If I may, Maestro? You like this? Nice, eh? It's from... from the first draw. Trinkets, knickknacks, all from negligible winnings. Not worth mentioning. Would you like a liqueur? An aperitif? - No! - I have it all! Want some? - No! Rather, what's the surprise? - Right, I forgot all about it. Just imagine... No! It's better you know nothing. Wait here for a moment. I say it again: It's a nice surprise. A bathroom! A heater! A portable bar! You make me spend bills of 100, of 1,000, and never make me win half a lira! Take it easy! Calm down! - Calm? - Calm down. Don Ferdina', guess who this is? - How should I know? - Your late father. I found it under the stairs with the coal. Maybe you forgot it when you moved. Then I said, "How happy Don Ferdinando will be!" Take it. Better to be in your home than in mine. Just look at him! So life-like! - How handsome! - Just look at him! Will you carry it or shall I send it? No trouble. - I'll carry it. Then I'll wrap it up. - Good. - Good. Wrap it up well, I beg you. How nice! It seems only yesterday when he'd tell me, "Procopio, you're lucky! You'll have a career!" He was right because I made my career. - Even too much. Don Ferdina', I love you. I have a great affection for you. I love you like a father. - Yeah? And your wife, I love as if she were my mother. And Stella, Don Ferdina'... - Stella is my daughter! Yes, and I respect her as a sister. I always say that Stella is a crown on my head. Watch it. I'll break that head of yours so no crown will ever fit it. Let's go, Maestro. Papa, I put you in a place of honor. I put up flowers. I light a candle. Let me win only once! What would it cost you? Not for the money's sake but the satisfaction! In Paradise, you know the winning numbers. Let me pick a double! - Don Ferdina'! Don Ferdina'! What is it? - Tonight's gonna be a beauty! Nice dark clouds are forming! - Really? - What a sight! You can't see well from here. We must go above. Well, we're going. Ferdina', you coming? Where? - I told you. The movies. - I can't. I'm busy. I know what you gotta do: Go on the roof with that piece of wood. I go where I want. - The system's unerring. - For ending up in a nuthouse! No, knowing the clouds shape is knowing the story of the dead and the living. Yes. Go on with your notions. It makes sense the Lotto Bank owner gambles all of his money in his own shop! I don't have to justify myself to anybody! - Yeah, go to ruin, end up broke! You hear this, Maestro? This is my cross. If I remarried, I'd take an African wife! An inferior race! That's the way to go! An unbearable woman! - Why unbearable, if I may ask? Because you're annoying. You're irritating and you well know it. Really? - Mama, let's go. We're late. - Yes, let's go! Don't come crying to me if you catch rheumatism, a cold... Go! Go to the movies! Go! You'll be the death of me! Don Ferdina'! The clouds are passing away. Set up the ladder. Meanwhile I'll get pen and paper. Here you are. - Thanks. Good evening Mrs Concetta and Miss Stella. - Evening. - Evening, Don Procopio. What a nice coincidence! - Yes, a coincidence. For you didn't know we'd be here at the Orange Garden, right? - Me? No. Right. And you didn't know he'd already be here. No, Mama, I didn't - Go on! You must think I'm an idiot. Well, Donna Concetta, if my presence bothers you... Not at all, no bother. But let's set this straight, an ice cream and then we'll go. - Yep, an ice cream! Have a seat! - Thanks. Waiter! Two ice creams! Two! The dark ones are keys. - Which ones? - Those. And that's a fireman's helmet. - A fireman's helmet? - Yes. So, 8 for fire, 21 for the firemen. A double. - A double? - Yes. Maestro! Come up, you'll see better. - Yes. - Climb up. Hurry up! - I'm coming. - Else, the clouds will change shape. Every shape is good! - Really? How beautiful! Here is a good view. Maestro, what do you see? - Over there. That's a cow. Yes, you can also see the udder. - Ah, that! - Yes, over there. It really is a cow! - Cow is 25. You wanna bet tonight we get the four numbers? Then the numbers won't win and I'll lose my money. - Don't be a pessimist. Who trusts not, wins not. A lizard! - Where? Over there. Between the two clouds. Right above the Dome of St Francis. I don't see a damn thing! - You let it get away! Get away? - It looked real. Let's write it down anyway. Lizard is 21. 19 and 5. We need one more number and we'll have 4 in a row. - 4 in a row? - Yes, be calm. Be calm! We need to be calm. To be lucky, one must have patience. Now then, let's try to find... - One moment! Over there! - Where? - You see it? - What do you see? I don't know. They're still forming. Look well, Maestro, find out. - It looks like a little boy. No. It's getting bigger. - Bigger? - Yes. Maestro, that's a duck! - No! It has four legs. Then it's an ass. - It looks like a dog to me. What? It's an ass. - No, a dog. - It's a straight-up ass. No! Can't you see? It's a dog! - It's an ass! A dog! - An ass! - It's a dog. Maestro, it's an ass! - A dog! - An ass! - A dog! You hear that? It's a dog. - What? That dog belong to those swine! Masaniello! Masaniello, what is it? - What's with this dog tonight? Be a good boy. Be good. - Come here, sweetie. Be good. There he is! Look! Don Ferdinando on his roof again! I'd like to know what those two do up there every night. There must be a mystery. - They look like two astronomers. What astronomers? Don't you see their evil faces? Those two are plotting something. Come, let's step back here. Hush! Hush, Masaniello! Go away, damn dog! One of these days, I'll give you poison and make you a ghost! Did you hear that? He wants to poison him! - If he even tries...! Well, if you don't mind we'll go now. It's late and my husband, you know... May I accompany you? - Accompany? - Yes, Mom, there's nothing wrong. I wouldn't want to trouble you. - Please! You've been so nice, offering us ice cream. Oh, it was a trifle! - Yes, come, don't stand on ceremony. I wouldn't want Don Ferdinando to see me. I don't know why but he doesn't like me. Don't worry! He's right now on the roof looking for numbers in the clouds. Come. Just for one minute. - Yes, come along. Down! Down boy! Damn dogs! Shut up! Down boy! Down boy! Down boy! Get away, you mangy mutt! - To your doghouse! Get the ladder. I'd like to tell him something! - Leave it. Better not mingle with riffraff. I wish Masaniello ate his leg! Make yourself at home, Don Procopio. Bring the bottle and some glasses. Ah, he's not here? - No, he's not. But even if he were, would you be scared? Scared? I'm not afraid of anyone. Yet, in the end, we'll have to... We can't keep seeing each other on the sly. I ask for nothing else. If mama agrees, I'm willing to talk to him tonight. Eh, go easy, Mr Bertolini. You'll need plenty of tact with my husband. What's going on? Donna Concetta, I'd better go. What's with you! What kind of man are you? It was nothing... I was passing where you were! What was that? What happened? Ferdina'! - He almost broke my head! He made the ladder fall. It means being idiot! I say, Maestro! Just look at that! Ah! - Yes, I'm here. Good evening, Don Ferdinando. - Evening. Papa, we went to the movies. We saw an excellent film. A sad love story. It made me tear up. Uh. And where did you find this cabbage head? - We met him by accident. Just so. We were going in and she said, "Mom, look who's there?" - The cabbage head. Go to your room! - Mom, see what he did? I've had enough, I'm leaving! You're right! Are you totally crazy? - Shut up or you'll get the rest of it! Me? I'd like to see that! I'm going for you're crazy! - Go! Go to bed! Don Ferdina', I've the honor to tell you that was an action you shouldn't have done! I know what I'm doing! - No! That slap is as if you'd given it to me! I don't see any harm in going to the movies together. Don Procopio, drop your idea on my daughter, or it will end badly! Don Ferdina', I won't drop it. - You'll drop it. - I won't! - You will! I won't drop it! - Then I'll kick you out of the Lotto Bank. Ah, no, no, no! Take it easy! I've the honor to tell you won't kick me. - Oh, no? - And you won't throw me out. You can only fire me. In order to do that, you know what to do. You'll have to give me severance pay or you'll deal with the union. And while we're on the subject, where is my old age and disability card? Why's that my concern? It's your concern! - Ah, no, no, no! Big mistake! Oh, how wrong you are! A mistake! It's your concern! You are the employer. You exploited my good faith. - Me? Pay deductions are due by both of us! Or else, I'll go to the union and you'll be in for a really bad time! So he wanted to kick me! - Yes, kick! - Me? I want all the unpaid dues! They're mine? I want them. All the arrears! Swine. Swine! See? That imbecile wants to send me to jail. Look, want the truth? But calm down, as we're at the point that nobody can talk! - Right! You slapped that poor girl! - She won't marry that beggar. Yeah, now we'll wait for Prince Charming! - She's to do what I say! Or I'll tear the house down! - Hey! - You know me! I'm the type... - Hey, hey! Enough! Stop it, Ferdina'! Or I'll take my daughter and leave! Got it? You're unbearable! You're a cross, you know? You're always well, eh? Always lively! You never get sick? Never a headache. Nothing! Always in good health! Stay sick in bed with a fever for 20 days so we can get some peace! Ah, mamma mia! Holy faith of God! This man leaves you breathless! Calm down, Ferdina'! Calm down! Ah! Why would Procopio Bertolini be such a bad match? I don't get it: He's young, good, honest, hard working, we know him and what he feels, he grew up in our home. I don't want to see him. - Why? - He's too lucky. That's good. Of course. If your daughter marries him, she'll be fine too. With his income they'll be well off. - Why, he's forced to win? Like a state job? Suppose that after the marriage he can't dream anymore, what will they eat? Yawns? You said yourself he always wins. - It's the truth! Always! Always. It's something diabolical. Witchcraft. I spend 100s of thousands lire, I spend my nights on roofs. I can't win half a lira! It's envy! - It's justice! - For he wins and you don't! - He won't have my daughter! I'll give her to him. - You can't! - No? - You have to wait for my consent. Really? What do you know? - Watch it or I'll kill both of you! Go ahead, Ferdina'! Kill us! So you'll end up in jail and the matter ends! Kill us! I should've married an African! - Get out of my way! Well? - Don Ferdina', I'm leaving. - Really? Go then. Are you going to make the bets? - No, it'd better you make the bets. Here are the numbers. Go. - Why don't you bet in your Lotto Bank? No, no. There are people there watching... Damn it, Bertolini would start commenting... I don't want to look a fool. It... It means I'll distribute them among all the... Yes, in several neighborhoods. How much do you need? About 1,000 lire. - 1,000 lire? Excuse me, Maestro. Papa! Here's another 1000 lire. Please, let me at least get back my money. Here's a 1,000 lire. Look well at it! Best wishes, Don Ferdina'. - Why? - Today's your name day. - Ah, I forgot. May you get all the good you wish. - Thank you. Morning, Don Ferdinando. - Ever the last! - The last? It's 9 o'clock sharp. It's precise. And I can't go wrong, as from the balcony I see you arriving, and while you open the door I wear my jacket and come down. Can't be more on time. Bertolini, this is bad. I mustn't find you on the balcony but in your post there! By the way, today is St Ferdinando day! I want no wishes from you! My best wishes anyway, Don Ferdina'. Believe me, with all my heart. All of it! And to you too, with all my heart! Don Ferdina', I placed all the bets. On a jackpot and a pair on all wheels. He's doing it! - Huh?- He's doing it! - What? The play! The numbers he dreamed last night. Cookies, liqueur..! Don't worry, Don Ferdina'. I'll go bet the others now. Some here, some there, like you told me. We'll meet at the draw. The draw? No, I won't go there. Every time I go it brings me bad luck. We'll meet at my house. - Yes. What are you doing? Why did you light all these candles? For my father's soul. Shut up or I'll light 12 more! Leave poor grandpa alone. The roofs were not enough already. He's crazy. Nuts! It's him! Open the door. - Who is it? The maestro with the numbers. - Ah, the maestro. May we? - Is Don Ferdinando Quagliolo home? - Yes. Tell him that the Cingallegra brothers want to talk to him. Only he can explain a certain matter! - Fine, I'll tell him. Papa? - What? - Notary Cingallegra's sons. What do they want? We barely know them. Whenever we meet, they salute us haughtily. They want to talk to you. But they look mean. - Let them in. - OK. Come in. Good day. - Good day. - Good day. You know nothing, eh? Our presence tells you nothing, you're innocent? Don Ferdinando! - Huh? - Our family dog is dead. So? - How, so? - I'm sorry, I understand that it may give you sorrow. However, do thank God. He rid you of a nuisance and a stink in the house. Was the nuisance yours? - And the stink? - I smelled it too. Because your dog found the way to our terrace, to do its business, big and small, and then flee! And so you killed him! - What, killed? - Yes, poisoned! Poisoned? I begged our Lady of Pompeii to make the dog croak, that, yes. But I didn't touch him. - You didn't, eh? We found him this morning on the terrace, with his stomach swollen and green snot dripping from his nose! Donna Concetta! Our dog was poisoned by your husband! Don't talk rubbish! - Rubbish! I heard what he said! "Beat it, you mangy mutt!" "If your masters don't chain you up, I'll give you poison and make you a ghost!" Yes, I saw you and the maestro lurking at night on the roof. What were you doing? That's our business. I go on the roof to get some air. Listen, I've never liked you... - Really? But now, after the death of my poor Masaniello, you make me sick! You must have the same end as my poor dog! With a swollen belly and green snot dripping from your nose! - Jinx! Let's leave, Vittorio! - You're two jinxes! May you drop dead, murderer! - Coward! Are they mad at me? - Forget them, come here. Go away. We must talk. Of course. The maestro is here! - Yes, the maestro's here. We need to talk. We won, eh? How many numbers did we get? How many? Say! - Not even one! No! - You can throw this away. Yes, I can throw it away. What numbers came out? 1, 2, 3, 4 and 26. Thank you, Papa. Thanks! But it's a good sign. - A good sign how? We played 45 numbers. Which is half of 90. - So? So? What is that's extraordinary? - What? It's not easy. - Not easy? What do you mean? Not one of them came out. If we had played... - the other half, ah! You said these were a sure thing. A cinch! I'll break your head because I can't be your fool! You get it? I came right away! - You're too excited, sit down! I feel faint! - I can understand! Oh, mamma mia! I can't even think! I can't! I got the four in a row! - Four in a row! - 450,000 lire! There's no doubt! There isn't! Here is the winning ticket. These are the numbers that were drawn. Don Ferdina', I dreamed about your father! - He dreamed about grandpa! Now he's starting with my family! - He was so nice! He was so nice! There he is! Exactly the same! He came into my room with Don Ciccio, the tobacconist. You remember Don Ciccio? He who died 18 years ago. - Yes. - And he said, "Kiddo, play 1, 2, 3 and 4. A four in a row on Naples. And put down 5 lire." 1, 2, 3 and 4? - Yeah. - And you played them? - Of course. And he called you "kiddo"? - Kiddo! - Let me see. - Here. There's no doubt. Don Ferdina', now that I'm rich, let me marry Stella. Time for that later. As the Lotto Bank's owner, I must send to the Bank of Italy. Right. He knows! - This way you'll get your winnings and give me a tip. A gift! A nice gift. - A tip. - You deserve it. The ticket's mine. What? - The jackpot belongs to me. The numbers came from my father. Don Ferdina', are you kidding? - Kidding? - Are you retarded? I won't pay you! Got it? I won't pay you! The ticket is here! Not even a troop of cavalry could take it from my pocket! Try to get it from me in court! With a 100,000 lawsuits! Got it? He's crazy! Crazy, I say! - I don't think Don Ferdina' is all wrong. Excuse me, but you don't know the facts! The ticket belongs to that poor boy! It was he who played it! Then Don Ferdina' snapped at him, "The money is mine!" "The money's mine! The numbers were from my father!" And he grabbed the ticket. Did he get the winnings? - No way! Don Procopio can put him in jail! Where is he now? - Who knows? He was just here. You should've seen him. He had wild eyes, like a madman. Then the maestro came and they left. And Procopio? - He went with Concetta and Stella to speak to the priest, Don Raffael. Why Don Raffaele? Did he play too? - They went to ask his advice. Don Raffaele, you must find a way to talk with him. He'll listen to you. To be honest, seeing how things are, I doubt it'll be easy to convince him. I know Don Ferdinando's character: generous, a heart of gold, loves his family. But forgive me the criticism, hard headed, stubborn! Stubbornness doesn't hold. Facts are facts. I have a million witnesses. All of Naples knows I won! - OK, OK, Don Raffael will talk to him. You must make him see he's wrong and to give back the ticket. No way! I know papa better than you. If he said he won't give it back, he won't. He won't? What do you mean? Up to now, I've been nice because he's Stella's papa, but if he angers me, Don Raffaele, even you wouldn't know me when I get mad! No, no, calm down. We need to be calm and prudent, we must not upset him. We must adopt a clever tactic and find a common ground which will please all. Fine, you'll see that I'm magnanimous. If he'll willingly return the ticket, I may even give him a gift. Oh, good boy! Now that's a good idea! And what kind of gift could it be? I don't know... a part of the winnings. 10, 15, maybe even 20,000 lire. 20,000 lire? He said 20,000 lire? A handout! Why? Is it your money? - Yes, it is! Did they fill you in? - Just a hint. - The money is mine! My father's numbers! But Procopio played with his own money. - Shut up or I'll slap you again! There you go! Slaps! You can't even speak because he starts slapping! One can no longer live along! - It's better I go or else... Yes, go, my daughter! Excuse me, Father. This has become impossible! Impossible! - There goes his accomplices! All are in cahoots to cheat me! - Who? Procopio Bertolini and his conspirators. - Conspirators? - My wife and daughter. Excuse me, Don Ferdinando, as things are, I don't think you can talk of cheats. That's something neither you nor I can decide but a person of law. Ah, the maestro! Don Ferdina'? - Eh? Did you find him? - Yes. He said you gotta go before 10, 'cause he's going to Court after. - Well done. What's his name? "Councilor Strumillo. Via Gradoni, 39." What? You're going to a lawyer? - Indeed. Before he sues me, I'll sue him. No, be reasonable! A lawsuit? You don't know how it'll turn out and it's costly. Even to my last cent. If I must, I'll sell my shoes. Do as you wish, but think it over. Lawsuits... - I've already thought it over! You come along to the lawyer too. Your presence will be necessary. It's about a real fine scam he wants to pull on me. I won a four in a row worth 400,000 lire with the numbers my father gave to a certain Procopio Bertolini. I have the winning ticket. - But his father... One moment, Don Raffael, let me finish speaking. One at a time or he won't understand. This Bertolini said it's his and he wants to give me 20,000 lire. And don't you give in. Without a doubt, this Bertolini must be crazy. You got the ticket. Collect the prize. End of story. - No. He has false witnesses. He's in cahoots with my wife and daughter. They say he played with his own money. But it was you played? - No, it was him. - So then? But my father gave him the numbers before Don Ciccio, the tobacconist. I see: He played with your money. - No, with his own money. Don Ferdina', as it appears, I can't give you a clear cut opinion. If your father gave him the numbers before a witness, we could stake a claim. The fact that Bertolini wants to give you 20,000 lire says something. However, go on your way. Collect the 400,000 lire and if this Bertolini should go to law, we'll call Don Ciccio, the tobacconist. No, he can't come. He won't. - Don't be silly, the police will make him come. He can't even refuse: He's dead. - Dead? - Yeah. What about your father then? - He's dead too. Wait, since when? - Two years ago. Don Ciccio, 18 years. When was this ticket won? - Last Saturday. How is it possible your father gave these numbers to him? - In a dream. Councilor! Procopio Bertolini dreamt Don Ferdinando's father gave him the four numbers before Don Ciccio, the tobacconist, he too dead years ago. Then it's Procopio Bertolini's dream! - No! This is the mistake! Bertolini lives in the house where I lived with my father which I left after his death because it made me uneasy. Now, my father, bless his soul, thought it was me in that room! He didn't realize that it wasn't me in that bed but Procopio Bertolini. He never said, "Procopio, play these numbers", but "Kiddo, play these numbers!" Because my dad used to call me "Kiddo". Well... well... well, this suit is a bit weird. How could I tell this stuff to the court? Are you a lawyer or not? - A lawyer for the living, not the dead! I can't bring his father's soul to court! - I told him so but he insisted on coming. Listen to me, if you don't want to get in trouble. Return the ticket immediately to its rightful owner. And hurry up and take the 20,000 lire he offered you. Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. But Councilor... - In court, you need documents, stamped papers, my dear! I'll buy the stamped paper! - And I'll bring it in blank? Please! You'll fill it! - Bye, Don Raffaele. Good luck! Good luck! You call that a lawyer? He wouldn't even listen. He understood nothing! Don Ferdinando, your claim is unfounded. Your father, that good soul, gave the four numbers to Bertolini. You must respect the will of the dead. That's why I came here, to get the will of the dead respected. That good soul appeared in a dream to Bertolini and gave him the winning numbers. You said yourself, "good soul". And speaking of souls, you must explain something to me. - If it's possible, I will. You know I've always lit the candles in front of my father's recess. You know every Friday, I go to the cemetery by taxi which costs 30 lire back and forth. Add 30 lire for flowers, and I'm at 60. Four masses a month at 10 lire each comes to 40 lire. The total: 280 lire a month. And did the soul of my father appear to Bertolini? - Certainly. And the afterlife? Does it exist or not? - Certainly. You mustn't even doubt it! So? I spend 280 lire a month on candles, flowers, taxis, masses for my dead father. And my own legitimate dead father gives a prize of 400,000 lire to a stranger? Impossible! - Don Ferdinando, you're like a madman! - Right. Masses are not done for gain! And please, if for every 10 lire mass, you got 400,000, it'd be out of proportion. The state would go bankrupt. Now listen to me, don't get yourself in trouble. Above all, don't make your wife unhappy. My wife! My wife! Now, you're too upset. You'll see later, reasoning calmly, that I'm right. Don Ferdinando, I salute you. Goodbye. Don't be stubborn. To err is human, to forget divine. Remember. I hope to see you in my church and you'll give me some good news. Good day. - I won't give in. I won't! Goodbye. Don Ferdina'! I was just looking for you. I must speak to you or I'll have no peace. He implored me, "Tomorrow morning, bring my message to Ferdinando." Who? - Your father. - Papa? I dreamed of him. It seemed so very real. - Tell me! How handsome he was with that pink shirt when he'd read the papers before the Bank. The first thing he said was, "Carme', I'm tired. Get me a seat." He was sweating heavily. "You must tell my son, Ferdinando, that the four-in-a-row is his." "When I came into the room, I never imagined Bertolini would be there!" "I know well he has the winning ticket. Don't be taken in or be talked over." "Because I can't give any more numbers." "Why not, Don Save'?" "I made a mistake and am being punished. They won't allow me to do anything more." He was sweating heavily. Then I asked him, "Don Save', why don't you talk to your son yourself?" "Because I don't know his address!" - Oh, damn the day I left home! "Carme', don't forget!" "Are you serious, Don Save'? Tomorrow morning, I'll find your son and tell him." I then woke up. It was a vision. A vision! Don Ferdinado, don't be taken in! Donna Carme', are you willing to say in court what you told me? Why should I be afraid? It's the truth. - When the time is ripe, you'll be called. Rest assured, not even the police will take the ticket from my pocket. - Well done. Tell my father that. - Tonight, when I see him, I will. Thank you. Eh, I trust to you. - Goodbye. From the onset I said Ferdinando got into a bad fix. Who could say? Don Ferdinando just went to the lawyer's. - No dice. I just found out. The ticket and the money are going to Don Procopio. Who told you that? - No, I, I... - Answer me. There's too much gossip here! Look here! Who told you that? - I... didn't... Everybody says so! - Who? - Don Biagio... the barber... Actually a gentleman said that if you did not return the ticket, you'd be in trouble. Somebody else will get in trouble! Where's Bertolini? - At home. - Go call him and tell him to come here. Yes, yes... - He must do what I say! What my father says! He must come here with the ticket and beg forgiveness. - Fat chance! While you stay here very easy, he's collecting the 400,000 lire. Then I'll have him arrested. And he knows this and is afraid! Oh, Procopio... - Yes, Procopio! - Why not try to come to an agreement? What can I do more? I sent word that I'd give him 20,000 lire. 20,000 lire? What are you nuts? A gift of 20,000 lire? There's no gift! If I marry Stella, the money will stay in the family, dear. Someone at the door! It's him! Go, open it. Go! Procopio! It's a certain Councilor Strumillo. - Who is he? Who knows? He came about the ticket. A lawyer? - Yes. - What does he want? Let him come in. This way. Are you Mr. Procopio Bertolini? - Yes, that's me. I spoke earlier with Don Ferdinando Quagliolo. He turned to a lawyer and instructed you to come to me. Fine. Before you open your mouth, let me say you're wasting your time. I didn't want a suit, but if I'm forced, should I even lose my shirt, I'll go up to the Supreme Court! - You're right! - What? Yours is the winning case. Trust me. We'll start right away and make him flee without his pants, I assure you! Excuse me, but aren't you Ferdinando Quagliuolo's lawyer? - No, I'm for justice. Whenever there's a lawsuit, I choose the winning side. When Don Ferdinando spoke to me, I saw right away you had the right. So, I'm here. We'll give him a nice subpoena which will make him give up that ticket! - No, no! No, Sir, no, I don't want a lawsuit. I prefer to manage the business amicably. "Amicably?" You hear what a fool my nephew is, Councilor? First he takes away your ticket and now you want to try nice manners! You keep quiet and hold your tongue. I prefer to settle the matter on my own. Councilor, look, there's at stake a sentimental matter. I love Stella. - Who's Stella? Ferdinando Quagliuolo's daughter. But he doesn't want me to have her. - No? Good! This is an excellent opportunity! We'll so drag him into the lawsuit that that he'll go insane. Then he'll come to you and hand over Stella to you! Don Proco! - What is it? - Don Proco! Don Proco! Isn't Don Procopio there? - Ah, it's you. What do you want with him? Don Ferdinando is waiting at his house and must speak to him. - OK, I'll tell him. Proco', you heard? The Maestro said that Don Ferdinando is expecting you. Me? What does he want from me, Sir? - Beware, Don Proco. Don't be taken in! I'm not to go? - Go, but be careful. It take nothing to be put into the wrong. Then it'd be best if you came along. I'd prefer not to, seeing that he called me first. What's wrong with that? You're a lawyer. We'll say that I called for your help and not that you came to see me. This way I won't look bad, which matters to me. He called me and I'm bringing counsel. - Yes. Thank you, Papa. Donna Carmela explained it to me indeed. I understand it all. They won't cheat me, don't worry. I won't give him the ticket. I'll rather eat it. Burn it! You're going to ruin our family. Give me the ticket. I'll give it back and you won't have to look bad, eh? - I'm no Pulcinella. My name is Ferdinando Quagliolo! And when I say something, that's that! The law is wrong: It says I can't bring my father's soul into court. We'll see! But reflect, think of your family. The more you wait, the worse it'll get. The time'll come when you'll be giving it up with a noose on your neck! Not even if they shoot me! Not even before a firing squad! It'll take a straight jacket! A straight jacket! - Fine. What do can you do with this ticket? What? You can't collect the money, understand? Because Bertolini would send you to jail! So I can't collect? - No! - No money for me? - No way! And Bertolini? - He'll send you to jail! - Then I'll go to jail with the ticket! You need witnesses. I'm part of the suit and I can't. The Maestro is on his side. - He'll be on our side. I'll give him a 1,000 lire. You'll give me a 1,000 lire? I'll do anything for a 1,000 lire. He's not enough, we need at least two. Witnesses? They're are two. The Cingallegra brothers. - Who are they? Sons of the notary who live upstairs. Yes, they hate Don Ferdinando because they say he killed their dog. Great, I'll go find them. Meanwhile, you go in and make him mad, tease him. When I arrive, you begin to scream like a nut until he gives you a nice blow. What if he breaks my head? - It'd be all gold for our cause! He breaks my head and I get gold? - Don Proco, if he does, you'll get gold! Go and announce Don Procopio. - Yes. Don Ferdina'! - You? You told him to come? - He's here. - Have him come in. I'll fix him, he's to do as I say! You want to shoot him? - I wish! But who knows, with my temper. Let's do this. No, I'll keep this! You never know... - Yes, maybe it's better. Let him in. May I come in? - Yes, he's waiting. Go on. And say, what mood is he in? - Ooh, it's black! Be careful, he's got a gun. - Mamma mia! But don't worry, I have the bullets. - Thank goodness. Let me see. - There. OK. - Go. - Yes. I'm here! What do you have to tell me? One moment. As you see, I'm writing and I can't speak with you. Then I'll leave because I can't wait for you. Yes, because it takes two minutes, and then you must do at my convenience! Got it, Bertolini? They're coming down now. The time to wear their coats. Gotta warn Bertolini to buy time, as without witnesses a blow on the head is no use! Leave it to me. - I'm counting on it. There. I'm done. Now then... I've called you to give you a speech. To make you lose all hope of the 400,000 lire which my father wanted to give me. You? - Me! Me! Most amusing! - I've witnesses ready to swear it. I want to bring you to reason. I want you to see that even if the law is on your side, in good conscience, you should say, "This money belongs to you. You take it." Yeah, as if it were half a lira! Don Ferdina', it's nearly half a million! And besides I won it. - You? - Me! - I could slap your face! I'd like to see that too! - But it takes patience. - Much patience. And lots of calm. - Let's stop. As I can't go to jail over a fool like you... - Watch what you say! - Let me finish. This statement which I've prepared, you'll copy and sign. Ah, no! Without the advice of my lawyer, I won't sign anything. - You'll sign. I won't sign. - You'll sign. - I won't! - You will! Fine. Let us reason calmly. May I at least know what I'm signing? - No, you must copy. Write. "Most illustrious Mr Ferdinando Quagliolo..." Are you the Minister of Finance? - Next to you, I'm "most illustrious." "The winning ticket belongs to you because you're its master and absolute ruler." "I also declare that after the honor of working for 14 years for the Lotto Bank" "for reasons of health, I voluntarily give up my post," "without pretending to any severance or insurance pay." Come in! Easy! Easy! I understand very well. You think I should sign this paper? Yes. - You make me laugh. Kiddo, you have a fever. Let me spell it out for you: If you don't give me the ticket, I'll send you to jail. Before you get to send me to jail, I'll send you to the cemetery! Is that so? - Correct. Copy the statement and sign. I won't sign. Don't laugh! Sign! - I won't sign. You won't sign? - No, no, no, no! - Then I'll shoot. Who? Me? - Exactly. - With that? How adorable! Go on and shoot! I'll do it! - Go ahead! If I shoot, you'll die. - Certainly but if you don't shoot, I'll never die. Oh, no? I'll kill you! - Here. Here. Here. Here! Go on shoot! Go on! - You don't care? - No! I don't care! I don't care! - Enough! Here I am! I'm here! - No, stop it! Witnesses! - I'm the lawyer for my client, Mr Bertolini! And you're witnesses, right? You saw it all? - We did. Embezzlement! Defamation! Extortion! Armed threat! A wound that'll take several days to heal. Lemme see. Eh, this will take 20 days to heal! 20 days! Open and shut case! All in cahoots! All of you! Cowards! Crooks! Blackmailers! Careful, the crimes will increase: insults, slanders... - If you don't get out, I'll kick you out! Get out! - Threats and aggression! Very good! What are all these people doing here? Procopio! What's up? You're wounded! - Your husband! How brave! Look what he did! - Mamma mia! That's blood! Wait! - Blood? Blood? It's gold! - Gold! If you don't want to get in trouble, return the ticket immediately. - No! I won't return it! - He refuses, the only thing left is to press charges. One moment. Don Ferdinando, for the last time, will you let me marry your daughter? Procopio Bertolini, you can forget my daughter! We shall. Goodbye, Donna Concetta. Sorry but I must go to the hospital. I need to be medicated. Goodbye, Stella. - Goodbye. - So, it's all his fault. Right, Councilor? All his fault. Defamation, extortion... What else? Armed threat and injury. Ah! Armed threat and injury! As you see, it was better if you shot me! You're a bastard! - Ferdina'! You've been a cross in my house for 14 years! You're lucky, as before you came in, I unloaded the gun so as not to ruin me. Or I would've killed you! Killed you like a dog! This is empty, you understand? This is empty: look! Mamma mia! It's a miracle! Well then... this is attempted murder! You're all witnesses of it! Now nobody can take 20 years of jail off your back! Jesus, I had a close call. Murderer! - Criminal! Fine! You want to ruin me, eh? But you won't succeed! Councilor, what's this? Take it. It's yours! But not my daughter. Even if you win four jackpots, I'll never give her to you! Listen well: This money will bring your damnation! It will curse you! You'll never be able to enjoy it! Papa! Papa, you know well that this money was not meant for him. And he knows it too! He wanted to take advantage of your mistake. All the worse for him! You'll always be with him! You'll make him spit them out, one by one, with all your damnations, all your curses! You'll put him through so much! You'll drive him mad with despair! Get out! Leave! All of you! Get out! Leave! May you be cursed! May you be cursed! Get out! Out! You too! Leave! Get out! You too! Get out! Well then, thanks a lot. Goodbye! - Thank you. See? You have the ticket. It went very well. Aren't you happy? Yes, but Stella... And then all those curses! They'll bring you luck! You won't be so dumb as to believe them? Councilor, I believe in curses? You don't know me. Me scared? It'll bring me luck! Don Procopio! Don Procopio! Help! Help! My leg! My leg, Councilor! My leg! My leg! Don Ferdina'! - What? - Don Ferdinando! Don Proco has fall... Procopio going down the stairs fell down. He broke his leg! A leg! - Yes! Thank you, Papa! Thank you! I knew it. Keep it up. Don't let him go, we're in the right! You do not need advice. Carry on! Well, does your leg hurt? - My head too, Councilor. I think something important is broken which controls all my internal movement. I don't know but I feel my head is filled with confusion. - Damn, it's swollen. My bone is also swollen. - Of course, it was a strong blow. Let's hope there'll be no gangrene. - Touch iron! Let's hope they won't cut it off. - My head? - Your leg. Councilor, do you like being a jinx? - We must always think the worst. Worse than that? I broke my head, busted my leg. Don Ferdinando won't give me his daughter. - You have the ticket! - The ticket... Let's hope nothing else happens. I believe Don Ferdinando's curse... - Don Proco! Don Procopio! Don't be alarmed! Don't be... - Speak. What happened? It's your aunt. Your aunt, yes. She has a small illness. An illness? - Yes. - What illness? Don't be alarmed. It was the shock. - Shock? Yes, when... when they tied her up. - Tied her up? Who did that? - The thieves. Thieves? When? - Tonight, at your house. Thieves? - And they took away everything. - Everything? Oh, my head! - Don't be alarmed! My leg! - Thank goodness the firemen came. Firemen? What do you mean? Because the thieves when escaping, overturned a lamp. The whole house burned down. - Fire too? - Yes. And this how you tell me? - Yes, I wanted to come earlier. But I had to run to the bank. - Bank? What bank? The bank where you have your money. - And so? What happened then? - The bank went bankrupt. Well done, Papa! - Aunt Erminia, due to the fright, had a nervous breakdown. And she can't fall asleep anymore. - Ah, good! Flowers for papa! And the other one... - The other one? - Had another complication. It seems they hafta re... - Rebreak? - Rebreak the leg. And he will be in bed for two months. - Two months in bed? - Yes. More flowers for papa. - Good. When will you stop this nonsense? You think a good Christian would wish evil? These are things between me and my father. I do nothing. I make no move. He does it all. I only note it. Why go on? You won't get the money. - It's not about money but justice! I think you're crazy, too bad for you, but don't drag your family into it. If Procopio wants to marry Stella, I'll let him. - Not me. - No? I'm the father and I won't consent. - And I'm the mother and have them married! And I'd like to see you stop me! - Beware, Concetta. If you exhaust my patience, I'll have a word to my father about you. Yes? You'll have a word about me? Do it! You know what? I'll set up a phone! It's comfier on the phone! - Sarcasm! Your Mr Bertolini tonight will receive a letter of dismissal. Understand? He'll be out of my hair! - You'll send him away? - Naturally. A prolonged unexcused absence, I'm in my full rights. He should've been visited by the municipal doctor and should've presented a medical note. And he didn't. That's the rule. Here you go, Papa. He was quite right to send him away. Perfectly right. He never said a kind word. He was so obnoxious! - Every time he came near me, he touched my hump! Because it brings luck! - Fine. - He has deserved all that happened to him. Because I know the numbers weren't meant for him but for Don Ferdinando. Ever since his bad deed he didn't win one! - He couldn't even win a pair! Every week, he'd lose a lot of money. And I'm told that everyday there are creditors at his house. Why doesn't he collect his winnings? - Who knows? 400,000 would fix a lot. Good morning, Don Ferdina'. - Good morning. Have you prepared the document for collecting Bertolini's winnings? It's all ready. There's also the writ from the Bank of Italy. He hasn't collected it? - No, Don Procopio is still ill. Ill? How sorry I am, poor boy! Later, bring him a letter from me with my best wishes for his quick recovery. You tell him, Councilor. Before, he went mad about that ticket, but now..! I don't know why you don't decide to collect your winnings! There's no hurry. - There's no hurry, there's no hurry... In the meantime, we don't have a penny. Only debts! I can't go out, for creditors wait lurking for me. Donna Erminia is right. I don't say this because of my fee, for heavens sake, even if I need money. What does it take? There's the bank and the writ! What's the hurry? I've the ticket, the money's in the bank. Who's gonna touch it? We'll collect. We will. - Right! We'll collect..! Meanwhile, the weeks go by. Tell the truth, you're so dumb that you fear Don Ferdinando's curse, eh? Me? Afraid of a curse? - It'd be stupid to believe in that junk! Yes, junk, yet every time I touch the ticket something happens to me. A broken leg, bruised head, the thieves, the fire, the bankruptcy! Just unfortunate coincidences! - Coincidences which has left me like this! Don't worry, I'll go with you and you'll see that all will go well. We'll go to the bank and within an hour we'll return with 400,000 lire. Give this letter to Procopio Bertolini. I can't meet with him. I'm going to the country with my family to get some air. Good day. - Good day. You're here too? - I was asked to help to complete the formalities for the collection. Very good. - You'll give us the writ? Sure, I won't keep it back, it's yours. To Bertolini, to Bertolini, the owner. Here you go. So you really decided to collect? - Yeah, I must. - Ah, right. It seems you had some misadventures. - Oh, trifles, trifles... Beware, Bertolini. Sometimes accidents happen when we least expect. What do you mean? - Dunno. You see, man proposes... and someone else disposes! What does that mean? Councilor? - He's just joking. Whoops! By the way, I forgot! - What? A letter! A little letter for you. - For me? - You didn't know? - No. This you can read at your leisure. Jokes! - We must go in the bank. Be well! - Best wishes, eh? Best wishes! Thank you. Thank you. This is a perfect dismissal. - A dismissal? For what reason? We'll find out. You still care about working there when you have 400,000 lire? Wait a sec, I don't have the money yet. - Who can take it from you? Almost there. We'll get down at the next stop, cross the street and we're there. Let's hope no other accident happens before. - My wallet! My wallet was stolen! It was in the back pocket of my pants and now it's gone! Stop the tram! Stop! Stop! Stop the tram! The police! Thief! There's the police station! - Police? Yes, let's go to the station! Forward. One moment. - Maybe him? That's him! No... no, it's not him. This one? - Mine is yellow and red! - Come forward, Miss. Now we'll lose a lot of time with this issue. - We didn't need this hitch! Next! - Let's go. One moment - I'm a lawyer and this is my client. We can go, eh? Search him. - But... - No chatter! This is my wallet, my handkerchief... Go ahead and search. - And what's this? This is my wallet! - Yours? - You're the thief! I know nothing, Commissioner, I swear! Councilor, tell him! Don Procopio, what got in your head? - Bring him inside! Don Ferdinando! - Good day! Good day, ladies! - Good day. Hi, Alfre'! - Don Ferdina', welcome! A sight for sore eyes! - Good day. - Good day, Mrs Concetta. Miss, you're more and more lovely. - A lovely girl. Alfre', I brought my friends to you. Please, make me proud. Don Ferdina', the place is yours. I give you the keys. Enter. Don Ferdina', see these razor clams. - Cut them up and bring them to the table. Vermicelli with clams? - A magnificent fish fry. Gragnano wine as usual... Some chicken too? - No, too much stuff. Either the chicken or the fish-fry. - OK. - Don Ferdina'! What it is? - Procopio Bertolini was arrested. - Really? They put him in jail! Procopio Bertolini was arrested! - Oh, Madonna mia! What happened? - He was taken for stealing a wallet. What are you saying? - The lawyer Strumillo told me. He's in prison? - Immediately. Vermicelli with clams, fried fish and chicken. - All right! Bring in the prisoner. Thank you, Sir, I'm glad this unfortunate misunderstanding has been cleared up. That nice young man is not only my client but a friend. - That's why I suspected him. Commissioner, what do you mean? - You understand. There he is. Come here. - Councilor! Commissioner, I swear to you... - Yes, we know, it was a mistake. You were lucky the real thief was arrested. - He was arrested? A typical thief tactic: To not be caught, he put the wallet in another's pocket. Unfortunately it was yours. - Councilor, is this a coincidence too? Now tell me I shouldn't believe! This too was Don Saverio's spite. Who is Don Saverio? - For heavens sake, pay no mind! Shall we go? The commissioner said... - Yes, let's go right away. My respects, Commissioner. - Thank you, Commissioner. To your health! - Cheers! Friends, eat and drink. Today is like a holiday to me. My wife is in a bad mood, but it will pass. I said eat! - Sure. - And you too. I'm eating. Can't you see I'm eating? This is crazy. You're not sad that Procopio Bertolini was arrested? - No. Maestro! How long do you think he'll get? A felony of theft with extenuating circumstances, at least 3 years. - 3 years! Papa, now I think you're going too far. But he knows what he's doing! Know what, you and grandpa? Even after 20 years of jail I'll wait and marry him! Maestro, are you asleep? Music! Where are they? Thanks. Look who's here! - Procopio! - Mama! - Down! Don Ferdina', cheers. Good day to all. Did you hear what happened to me? - Yes, vaguely. How did you know we were here? - I asked your doorman. You had a little mishap. How come? It was a small judicial error. - Maestro. And they released you? - Did you want that they sent me to forced labor? Me?! God forbid! I'm glad to see you free. Don Ferdina', I'd like to talk to you. - Go on, talk. But due the importance of the matter, if you all excuse me, I want to talk in private. All right. Pardon me, friends. I'll be right back. What would you like? - Poison. What have we done? - Go, go. - OK. Here I am. Well? - Don Ferdina', you must do me a big favor. Of course, if it's something I can do... This is it, Don Ferdina': Sometimes, youth and inexperience lead you to mistakes. Little by little, I became convinced you were right and that your claim was just. I repent. I ask you to forgive me and to take back the ticket. Here you go. It's yours. - Eh, no! The ticket is yours and you'll keep it. No at all. It belongs to you. - No! You're asking for the impossible. The ticket is yours because you played it. Yes but your father gave me the numbers. - What's that got to do? My father knew you. He loved you. He wanted to benefit you. - No! Remember well, your father made a mistake. He didn't want to give them to me, but to you. He came to my home believing you still lived there. - No, no, no. Don Proco, that won't hold up. You think in the beyond they're not aware? They know everything. - Don Ferdina', I ask you nicely. You must take this remorse away from me. - Remorse? And why do you have remorse? You are the rightful owner. The 400,000 lire belong to you. It's yours. - No, yours! - I'll collect and bring it your house. I'll roll you down the stairs with your 400,000 lire. And I'll come back on all fours and bring it back! And I'll break your head once again. - You make me lose my patience. The 400,000 lire are yours! I don't want to lose my life! I want to live! I don't want to die! I don't want the 400,000 lire! Me neither. - Who will take it? You must take it! Rip it up! Burn it! So we won't hear about it anymore! We don't need it! She's right, poor girl, she's right! Come here. Come here. Leave her alone. Tell me the truth. Do you really love him? - Yes, Papa. Bertolini, sit down here. Sit down! You, there. There! Sit down. What do you want to do? - Shut up! Let's go to our table. Come. Papa is good deep down. Come, come. Here I am. Excuse me for being away, but I had a matter to settle. Alfredo! - Order me! - Bring some spumante, quickly. - OK. I've the pleasure to announce my daughter's betrothal to Procopio Bertolini. Procopio's dowry is the merit of winning 400,000 lire with 4 numbers directed to me. And my daughter returns it as her dowry to Procopio Bertolini. Your orders? - Bring this to the table with the gentleman and the young lady. Don Ferdinando sends this to you. - To me? To me? But... No, no, no! - Thank you. But... - This money is mine. My dowry. Come here. Don Ferdinando! Don Ferdina'! Don't forget to tell that good soul, your father, that I returned the ticket! I'll tell him! Hey! Remember if you don't make Stella happy, I'll have a little word with my father! He'll call you from the other world! English subtitles by sineintegral@KG Rev by edam17 Apr 2020
