CJ ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS A JFILM AND MOOV PICTURES PRODUCTION EXECUTIVE PRODUCER JEONG TAE-SUNG Yongdu intersection? You found your way alright. Turn right and you'll see a cornfield. Continue down a little... No, no... Stop. Mr. Lee? How about I just sing one? I haven't sung in ages. But you have too many hit songs. I've just learned that 'Twin Folio' was originally a trio, that there was a third member alongside Song Chang-sik and Yun Hyeong-ju. You're right. The band started off as a trio. I thought about inviting him as a special guest. but no one seemed to have his contact number. I heard you two were close back in the day. It's been over 20 years since I last heard from him. But for the others, it's been over 40 years. Ever since he quit. Twin Folio's... third member... Mr. Oh Geun-tae. C'est Si Bon is Korea's first live music cafe to open in 1963. It was a mecca for a new generation of folk singers such as Song Chang-sik and Yun Hyeong-ju who brought a new sensation to the existing popular music scene. Twin Folio, in particular, gained an immense popularity. But those who spearheaded the golden era of C'est Si Bon took a big hit with the marijuana scandal of 1976. There was a time when we were young. Mugyo-dong, Seoul Late 1960s Is that Jo Yeong-nam? Oh my God, it's him! JUNG-WOO HAN HYO-JOO JIN-GOO KANG HA-NEUL JO BOK-RAE Is it because of your old man? I got tired of singing. Will we ever see a new star that surpasses Yeong-nam? Yun Hyeong-ju! Yun Hyeong-ju! Then of course, there is Yun Hyeong-ju. The winner of Student Night for the last 10 consecutive weeks has declared that he will no longer be singing here in order to focus on his study. No! This can't be true. No, Hyeong-ju! Back off. I came all the way from Suwon to hear you sing. If only he wasn't pre-med... We've heard all contestants for the 24th Student Night... Sorry, we had another contestant. From Hongik University, Song Chang-sik! - Mr. Song? - Song who? I don't see his name. Ah, there he is. A returning student, perhaps? Let's have Chang-sik on stage. What will you sing for us? A song of a vagabond? I don't need that. Ladies and gentlemen, he doesn't want microphone. That prick... What's he playing at? I have the name of the winner right here in this envelope. Tonight's winner is... Yun Hyeong-ju ...'s 11th consecutive victory was just halted by Song Chang-sik from Hongik University! Song Chang-sik, congratulations! That's how the lifetime friends and rivals met for the first time. You said you were quitting. C'est Si Bon needs a new face. Right? Keep it down unless you own the damn place. We're renting because we're so fucking poor. Countryside bastards... Look what we have here... Come here, you bastard! Come on. Punk! What the hell? Hey! Quiet, all of you! Shut up! What are you staring at? I'll gouge out your eyeballs. Hey you, run along. Get the hell out of here. You too. He knows his guitar, too. Told you he's something. Will our new star, Chang-sik, take home his fourth win? I just can't believe my eyes. The last contestant tonight is Yun Hyeong-ju from Yonsei University. I thought our former star had left to focus on his studies. Is he here to vent out the stress, or to reclaim his throne? Perhaps the new guy's sparked something in Hyeong-ju's heart. I'll be damned. That's what C'est Si Bon is about! And tonight's winner... I feel my heart beat a little harder tonight. And the king returns to the throne. Yun Hyeong-ju! Puts an end to Chang-sik's three week reign. Congratulations, my man! I'm thinking about putting them together into a duo. What do you think? Well... Put two big egos in the same room, there's bound to be conflicts. You think? You need someone who can act as a buffer. How about a trio? A trio? I'm not so sure... The Beegees who's sweeping the Billboard's chart is also a trio. A trio is three. Three... Three is 'Set'... Bon. Set-is-bon. C'est Si Bon is a trio! It's destiny. Who will be the third guy? The third member? Jang-hee can be that. No, his voice's too weak. Hey, did I even say I wanted it? Do you know anyone? Hyeong-ju has a silky voice and Chang-sik is a tenor. It'll be nice to have bass or baritone. Where do we find him? It's not gonna be you. I don't want to sing anyway. I'm more interested in writing and putting together albums. What they call 'producing' abroad. I will make you a producer. Just find this guy for me. What the f...? You freaked me out. I know you. You're on working scholarship? Are you underprivileged? No, I'm making an extra buck to upgrade to a single... Wait, who are you? You go to this college, too? Nice and thick. I knew I saw right. Wanna become a singer? What are you, a talent scout? I'm not looking for a trot singer. What then? A folk singer. Fork? Fo... Just take the job. It'll easily cover your rent. What the hell do you want from C'est Si Bon? Here he goes again. This isn't the place for someone who studied voice. Singing's just singing. Teach me how to sing American pop. I'm a quick learner. I'm not doing this because I like you. I'm only doing it because Mr. Kim promised a record deal. Likewise. Didn't you say we'll be a trio? Jang-hee is bringing someone. He said I should be excited. What are you doing here, country boy? Back at you, city girl. Maybe you didn't learn your lesson that night. Maybe you suffered a major brain damage. Want a round 2? Bring it on. Jang-hee, You're still not it. I'm not that low of a man. So, you can't play the guitar? I'm told I only need to sing. I don't suppose you read music either. I'll mark your parts. Can't believe I even have to do this... You don't. What's my part? Bass? There isn't much anyway. What? Did I surprise you? I sang in a choir for 4 years. Start with your strings. Come now, chop chop. Two three, ♪ You were like a dream that ♪ ♪ came to me on a spring day ♪ ♪ A dream I thought ♪ ♪ would last forever ♪ ♪ The sand castle of bliss ♪ ♪ from that summer beach ♪ That was you, country boy. Thought you can read. My choir didn't have guitars. Is that right? ♪ I love you, darling ♪ ♪ I love you forever more ♪ Wasn't that better? Your voice isn't as powerful as mine. I should take the melody and you, the harmony. Because you don't want to sing harmony? Oi, country boy. Which one was better? Mine, or his? Well you see, city girl, my part's exactly the same. You're right, country boy. Just go with my version. It's clearly the best. It really isn't. Away you go, empty shells. With April snow, away you go. Is Mr. Kim here? Can I just debut as a solo? Chang-sik is just hopeless. I entered Seoul Arts High top of the class. And the country boy... What kind of folk singer can't play the guitar? What am I supposed to be? A goddamn punching bag? This isn't what I bargained for. Where is my 120 won a day? Asadal and Asanyeo shall bow each other... Hey, Jang-hee! - I quit. - Please do. - You know what? I'm out. - Right, good bye. I was willing to work this out but just look at him! A drink coupon? Min Ja-yeong! Jang-hee? What are you doing here? This is my hangout. You have a mustache. Yes, I do. Do I look dandy? No, it's awful. - How have you been? - It's been so long. My good buddy, Jang-hee! Is she a friend of yours? Let me introduce her. This is Ja-yeong. We used to go to same church as kids. We did a play together. I was Samson and she was... - Delilah. - Delilah! This is Yun Hyeong-ju. He sings here. That's him? I heard the poet, Yun Dong-ju, is your cousin. A second cousin, yes. And this is Song Chang-sik. How're you doing? The new genius at C'est Si Bon? Is that right? Genius, no. Prodigy, maybe. What about him? Is he a singer, too? I thought you were leaving. Well, I... I'm Oh Geun-tae. I sing with these two. I thought you quit. Yun Hyeong-ju, Song Chang-sik and me, Oh Geun-tae. We three are a trio. And so the trio was formed. ♪ You were like a dream that ♪ ♪ came to me on a spring day ♪ ♪ A dream I thought ♪ ♪ would last forever ♪ Country boy, two three. ♪ The sand castle of bliss ♪ ♪ from that summer beach ♪ ♪ got swept away by the wave ♪ ♪ You can leave me ♪ ♪ You can forget me, darling ♪ ♪ My heart will always be the same ♪ ♪ The only regret I have ♪ ♪ is not loving you more ♪ ♪ The sand castle of bliss… ♪ What do you think about the tambourine?

Empress Myeongseong had the same name. Oh, Queen Min! It's Empress Myeongseong. And she has a lofty dignity of an empress. Charming! Your girlfriend's here. Come on, boys. Great job. Hey, I almost didn't recognize you with your new... Hyeong-ju! It's not the hair... It's the person. So, what did you literature girls think of our trio? I want to hear your thoughts. I think it was a brilliant idea to put Song and Yun into a band. But... But what? The other guy doesn't seem to be quite up to scratch. You can't say that to his face! No no, it's okay. I'm just giving a constructive feedback. I have a different opinion on that. Between the two brilliant men, Mr. Oh Byeong-tae... - It's Geun-tae. - Huh? Oh Geun-tae. Right... Mr. Oh Geun-tae is doing a fantastic job. You think so? Take The Beatles for instance. Both John Lennon and Paul McCartney are geniuses but could they hold together without Ringo and George? It's easy to stand out for your brilliance. But being brilliant without showing is a real challenge. In that sense, Mr. Oh Byeong-tae... - Oh Geun-tae. - Geun-tae. Mr. Oh Geun-tae is essential to the group. Man, I love that chick. So, he's Ringo Starr.

Fishery is a big business. The food is great. What else... It's where Admiral Yi beat the Japanese invaders. Admiral Yi Sun-shin? He is my favorite historical figure.

And Yeong-nam couldn't make it? You should be grateful he's not. What's taking you so long? I'm starving! They have a guitar. Let's sing. Fantastic! Let me just finish this.

An identical twin who was born one minute after me. Her name is Se-yeong. She had polio at birth. So, she never went to school when I even got to go to college.

That summer, so many songs were written because of a girl. Truly, she was our muse. I envy them for writing songs on the spot. I heard weed gets you inspirations. Maybe I'll try that. You don't even smoke, dumbass. Hey, you've got tons of songs stashed away. Can I borrow one? Lend you a song? Yeah. Hey! Do I know you? You must be a friend of my sister's. Are you Ja-yeong's younger sister? Yes. I'm Min Se-yeong. She told me you're twins, you really look the same. My sister is way prettier. She's a city girl, I'm not. They say you can't take the country out of the girl. How do you know my sister? She's a regular at the live cafe I work in. C'est Si Bon, right? You play guitar and sing pop songs there. I heard Jo Yeong-nam used to sing there before he debuted. Ja-yeong told me about a trio, too. Song Chang-sik, Yun Hyeong-ju, and what's the other one... It was Oh... That's right. Oh... Oh... Geun-tae! That's the one. I'm Oh Geun-tae. Did she tell you about me? She said she is good friends with the trio. That's my bus. Alright, have a safe ride. Hey, I'll buy a lunch next time, for you and Ja-yeong! You got it! Take care, sister-in-law. I ran into Ja-yeong's sister today. They look so much alike. Wait, who? Ja-yeong's twin sister? She was pulling your leg. Did you really believe her? Then, who's that girl I saw earlier? Ja-yeong! You saw Ja-yeong. No, I'm telling you. She had a limp and spoke with an accent. Ja-yeong just joined a theater company. Her first role is a country girl from Gangwon province. You understand now? Ha! Then, why did she walk with a limp? Because her character has a limp! Mr. Oh Byeong-tae. Sis? Is that you? It's really you. Yeong-ok! They're reunited. It's me, Yeong-ok. Your competition is down by one.

We're closed for the day. I said we're closed. Ja-yeong, is that you? I saw the light was on. Why are you still here? I can't practice at home because of the neighbors. I practice for hours every day with no improvement. I don't think I have the talent. Here's another one with no talent. Don't be silly. Your acting is amazing. No, you got your leg pulled because you're a fool. I meant your performance on stage. Were you at the theater? I went on the opening night. Why didn't you visit me backstage? I wasn't invited or anything. It was you who left the gift in the dressing room. I wasn't interested in acting from the start, you know? There was this guy that I had a crush on since high school. I joined the company so I can see him more often. As I got to know him, the fantasy was crushed. But now I really want to be a good actress. Acting is so much fun. - Want one? - Huh?

It's all oldish. Yeah, it is. You gotta put money in it. But look how slow the business is. Good job, boys. Boss, we need a raise. They pay 90 won per hour at OB's Cabin.

We don't have that channel down here. Geun-tae! Come on, son. When are you coming back to Seoul? My old man's business gets crazy at this time of year. How come you're... Hello? Geun-tae?

Because I don't go to C'est Si Bon anymore, my father seems to believe that I've given up singing. Jang-hee, do you think I'll find happiness being a doctor? If I can heal people's broken hearts with my songs, couldn't that also be meaningful? I'm traveling around the country and am learning how beautiful the traditional folk melody and rhythm is. Although I'm singing American pop songs now, one day, I want to graft traditional melody with popular music. P.S. Send me some money, will you? Crazy bastard. I'm surprised how the success of a movie can change a man. Do I sense sarcasm? I still remember you reciting Lord's Prayer in Sunday school. Now you're smoking cigarettes. Do you still want to marry me? You told me back in high school to wait for you until you graduate. Men are such simple creatures. You honestly believe that if a girl falls for you, she'll carry the torch forever? I saw you on television. You must have a good eye sight. My mother calls me 'Miss Blink' because I only appear for a second. But you played a bigger part in the weekend soap opera. Apparently my director liked my acting from the play. Are you friends with the director of drama? We were in the same theater club. You made such a fool out of me. FEMALE STUDENT This is the script for my next film. It's an adaptation of Choi In-ho novel. I'm sorry for being harsh to you in the theater company. I wanted to discourage you from entering this world. You wanted to be an actress like Audrey Hepburn, right? I want you to be my muse. I thought you have to be handsome to become a singer. I'm not supposed to tell you yet but I'm getting my debut as a singer soon. Next year, I'll be too busy to help you with fishing. Is that right? Your father's running for presidency next year. I'll be watching you on TV from the Blue House. But I'm telling the truth. Ja-yeong! Min Ja-yeong! Geun-tae! Ja-yeong! Why did you take the trouble when I'm coming back to Seoul soon? I didn't know it was so far. I took the night train and arrived only now. Hey! I can't breathe. Wow, what's that? I've never seen a cassette player that tiny. It was my uncle's gift from Japan. You could actually carry it around to listen to music. It's my favorite song. 'Wedding Cake' by Connie Francis. Will you learn it and sing it for me? It's such a sad song. Sad?

You'll fall on your asses when you hear the new sound system. Somebody saw you singing at OB's cabin. That's absurd. I saw you there, too. Listen. Your drifting ends here. Following the grand re-opening celebration show, we'll start recording your debut album. Is it all going to be translated pop songs? Let's play safe since it's your first album. Don't worry, I got you the best lyricist there is. Who would that be? Kim Chun-sik. Who's that? You don't know who that is? You don't know your own boss' name? My name isn't 'Mr. Kim.' It's Kim Chun-sik, you buggers. What do you think? I'm not too convinced. The song is in the female key. 'White Handkerchief' is a Nana Mouskouri song. I need to hear it a few more times. Let me borrow this. I don't think so. It's a gift from my girlfriend. You listen on your player. You call yourself a friend?

The girl I love is crazy about this cafe. I thought she loved it more than myself. So, I felt jealous. At this very place she loves dearly, I wish to manifest my love for her. To my soul and muse. What is this? So, this was a proposal event. The star director and C'est Si Bon groupie, I mean, the rising starlet, Min Ja-yeong were lovers? We'll carry on this evening of love with C'est Si Bon's next song. ♪ There is nothing better ♪ ♪ than being in love ♪ Ja-yeong! Ja-yeong! Ja-yeong! Ja-yeong! You're going on air tomorrow. Congratulations. It's no big deal. Are you alright? I'm fine. To tell you the truth, I hooked up with tons of girls this summer. This girl who had a huge crush on me back in high school, she got her eyes done and became a pageant queen. After a few of drinks, I couldn't see why I shouldn't bed her. And there was this other girl... Where was I? I've known this one for some time... Maybe he had an accident. Does he know the exact time and venue? He is the one that fussed the most about this. Then, why...? If this falls through... Don't even... Okay, okay. I got it. I never imagined out of the three of you, Geun-tae would be the one to screw me over. Don't wait for him. What? He's not coming. What are you jabbering about? Just a day has passed and nothing is the same. Was it all but a dream? The time I spent at C'est Si Bon was nothing but a dream. I want to wake from it now. My reason for singing is gone. Let's go as a duo without him. A duo? Kim, wasn't it a duo project initially? This is an opportunity we can't miss. Okay! We'll go as a duo. We gotta change the name first. The C'est Si Bon duo doesn't sound right. Geun-tae, you bastard! Any ideas? Urgh! Nothing comes to mind. What's sheet music called in English? Folio. Folio? Duet Folio, it is. TWIN FOLIO Next, we'll hear a song by Twin Folio. ♪ Enclosed in the letter she sent me ♪ - ♪ notifying of our break up ♪ - A pop song from a classic channel? Who changed the channel...? ♪ was a carefully folded ♪ ♪ white handkerchief ♪ ♪ When I left the hometown ♪ ♪ she stood on the hill ♪ ♪ and in tears, waved ♪ ♪ the handkerchief ♪ ♪ the white handkerchief ♪ ♪ The trace of her tears ♪ ♪ has disappeared completely ♪ ENGAGED: DIRECTOR AND HIS MUSE ♪ Now it's my fresh tears ♪ ♪ that soaks the handkerchief ♪ Twin what? Twin Folio. Twin Folio, okay. It was Twin Folio's legendary debut. It's the rookie duo, Twin Folio! I don't see him. The little bugger's become a bluffer. Twin Folio! Twin Folio! The crowd's gone crazy even before the album release. Songs, songs... Jang-hee, can you pick out some good pop songs? We'll need at least 10 songs for a full album. I got it. Se-hwan, Don't beat down your guitar so hard. Be gentle as though you're caressing your lover. Gently. ♪ There is nothing better in ♪ ♪ the world than the one I love... ♪ Stop smiling. Geun-tae, I really like this seaweed roll. Geun-tae. Oh Geun-tae. No one's ever made me laugh as much as you did. Thank you for that. And sorry. Geun-tae, I really like this seaweed roll. Seaweed roll? ♪ The handkerchief she waved at me ♪ Stand back everyone! Lee Jang-hee. Lee Jang-hee, right? Did you see Yun and Song smoke marijuana? As far as I'm concerned, they never touched that stuff. Are you trying to protect your buddies? I'm not protecting anyone. We can get them without your testimony. I only did it because my friends said it was a cigarette. Weed? Me? You smoked it at C'est Si Bon on November 2. You smoked with Song and Yun and the other clowns. This cigarette tastes funny. It's gotta be a misunderstanding. We have a witness. Just admit it. Your friends gave you up. Confess. Are you trying to use my friends against me? We never smoked marijuana. Possession alone is a criminal offense. Damn it, who's framing us? - Bring the bastard to me. - Shut up! You know Oh Geun-tae? Your friend. He told us everything. The truth didn't matter. It was a crazy time. MUSIC CAFE C'EST SI BON SHUT DOWN With C'est Si Bon closed, our youthful days were over. No one's heard from Geun-tae since. No one asked about him. Twin Folio was disbanded in just one year. It was difficult for me to remain in Korea. So, I started a new life in America. Los Angeles, 20 years later You're listening to Lee Jang-hee's 'A Letter From LA.' It's raining now in Seoul. Over here in LA, we get just a day or two of rain in a year. Sometimes, I miss the rain from my home country. It's a beautiful night everyone. What are you thinking about on a night like this? You have a guest waiting outside. You own this restaurant, too? I heard that you're the owner of the radio station. You're making the most money out of all of us. I'm the worst singer. I'd better be good at something. Are you in touch with Hyeong-ju and Chang-sik? It's hard to meet Chang-sik because he only works at night. Hyeong-ju wants me to come to church, so I try to avoid him. No, thanks. I quit since I moved here. I heard you live like an ascetic. I see that's true. I could easily stop drinking but smoking's a different story. Weed is not addictive but this... You used to smoke weed? People in my world experimented with it at least once. It wasn't illegal back then. Look at you... You guys at C'est Si Bon took the fall for everyone. They wanted to control you folk singers. They even passed a new legislation to do that. It's all in the past. What about Geun-tae? Did you hear from him? Oh Geun-tae? Even you haven't heard from him. Of course we didn't. You should come on my show while you're here. The 70's star of the silver screen visits Los Angeles. Forget it. No one remembers me. Ja-yeong. I'm taking a trip with a friend. Where are you going? Las Vegas and San Francisco. If you lose all your money, call me, I'll loan you some. - I'm gonna take off. - Okay. Have a safe trip. Let's go easy on the first night. Okay. Hey. What's the matter? That's my old favorite. What is it? 'Wedding Cake.' That's the original of the Twin Folio song. Twin Folio's 'Wedding Cake'? But that's a sad song. You used to sing with the Twin Folio? I'm telling you. It was originally a trio. But I quit and they became a duo. You could've sung that song. I guess so. If I didn't join the army, maybe. The original lyrics is about an ordinary house wife. How come Twin Folio's version has such sad lyrics? That's the charm of translated songs. You want to go to LA? My aunt lives there. I want to drop by to see her. I booked your rental car. You can pick up the keys from the office. I'm flying straight to San Francisco. Okay. Drive safely. Lee Jang-hee's 'A Letter From LA' Radio Korea You're assigned to San Francisco? Our company lab is in Silicone Valley. Silli... what? Why wouldn't your wife come with you? It would've been good for your daughter, too. You're listening to Lee Jang-hee's 'A Letter from LA.' The time now is just after 8:20. Do you know the feeling of time and place jumbling up in company of an old friend? Although I live in LA 16 hours away from home, I've just met a friend from long ago... I was so happy to run into an old friend in America. Let's record three day's shows. I'm taking a few days off for air. Where are you off to? Sedona, Arizona. It's a good place for meditation. I've been living here for 10 years and have never been there. What's there to life? You gotta follow your heart. Jang-hee. You... You look exactly the same. I never grew up, that's why. You've become an old man. I'm a company man after all. You're married? I married the prettiest one of the girls that wanted me. Why did you cut yourself off? You didn't have to do that to me. There was a rumor that you gave us up but we all knew that it wasn't true. Disappearing like that only made you look worse. It's good that I came to see you. Of course. We're friends, back then and still. Can we drink soju? Jeez, wake up! Someone's calling. Hello? Hey. - Oh, you're here? - Hello. I promised a radio appearance? I don't remember. You're lucky it's a pre-recorded show. Thinking back, you did miss a live show before. You're listening to 'A Letter From LA.' We have a special guest in the studio. 20 years ago, he sang alongside Song and Yun as a trio until he quit the band right before their debut. Please welcome, Mr. Oh Geun-tae. Hello. I'm Oh Geun-tae. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to be on the show. I reconnected with Jang-hee last night after 20 years. We had some drinks. He tells me that I got wasted and begged to be on the show. I don't remember much about that. You want me to what? You said you wanted to. From what I saw last night, you still have got it. Are you making it up because I was wasted? Like you said, once I got it I got it for good. Even after 20 years. Let's ask Geun-tae to sing for us. What will you sing? I had a friend who used to believe that I wrote this song. Not any more though, right? I released it a few years later. Now the whole country knows that it's my song. ♪ I have something ♪ ♪ Something to say to you ♪ ♪ Out of the blue, tonight ♪ ♪ I want to say this to you ♪ ♪ I will give you everything ♪ ♪ give you my all ♪ ♪ I'll give you my love ♪ ♪ that's bursting out of my heart ♪ ♪ For you, there is nothing ♪ ♪ nothing I won't do ♪ How about you sing together? Not a chance. I haven't sung in over 10 years. We have someone who hasn't touched guitar in 20 years. Thanks, buddy. The show will go on air tomorrow evening. When are you heading off to San Francisco? Tomorrow or the day after. Drive up the Route 1 along the coast. It's a detour but it's beautiful. I'm returning the rental car and taking the plane. Sentiment is a luxury for a company man like me. Hey, listen. Ja-yeong is in California now. I wasn't sure whether to tell you or not. But I thought it's stupid to not tell you. Jang-hee, the rumor that I ratted you out 20 years ago when it happened... It's true. I gave up your names. But why? I was never one of you. Shall we go straight to the hotel? You'll need to pack for your flight tomorrow. Who's singing this? I don't think it's the Twin Folio. It sounds like Jang-hee. But I'm not sure about the other one. ♪ In tears I leave ♪ ♪ for someone that isn't you ♪ ♪ After this night, I leave ♪ ♪ for someone I don't love ♪ I sang for the first time in a while thanks to a friend. A man who could've been a Twin Folio, Oh Geun-tae... Oh Geun-tae...? We were young and clueless but because we were... Can I help you? I'm here to see Jang-hee. Can I wait until the show ends? I'm afraid this is recorded. Mr. Lee is in Sedona now. Oh, really? You have kids? I have a daughter in kindergarten. Did you get married late or had your baby late? I read about you in magazines from time to time. Yeah... I've divorced and am raising the children on my own. The night before my wedding, you left a cake outside my house, didn't you? How did you know it was me? I just did. My army colleague was a baker. I got him to make it for me. So, you joined the army. We all kind of assumed. I remember the seaweed roll. It was the first time I had it. Now you can see it everywhere. You can easily find it in Seoul, too. That's true. I gotta board now. Sure. Take care of yourself. You, too. Did you have a good time in Sedona? I'm boarding my plane now. Hey... Guess who I ran into at the airport. Geun-tae? So, you met after all. Good to hear you two got to catch up. But Ja-yeong, it just occurred to me while I was in Sedona. The incident from 20 years ago... People in my world experimented with it at least once. It wasn't illegal back then. If you tried it couple of times like you said, how come you were never called in for questioning? I mean, even the innocent ones were implicated. I was a nobody back then. Miss Min, in the Marijuana scandal two years ago, there's a rumor that your name was originally included in the list. What can you do for me? I will sing for you for the rest of my days. I gave up your names. Do you think... Do you think there is a chance that Geun-tae gave up C'est Si Bon friends' names because of... ♪ I will give you everything ♪ ♪ give you my all ♪ ♪ I'll give you my love ♪ ♪ that's bursting out of my heart ♪ ♪ For you, there is nothing ♪ ♪ nothing I couldn't do ♪ ♪ I will catch the stars ♪ ♪ and put them in your hands ♪ Geun-tae! You... Did you... Did you do it for me? You sold out your friends to protect me? Why did you do it? Why did you do it? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh Geun-tae! Oh Geun-tae! MIN JAE-YEONG Detective, There's someone here who doesn't belong to the list. I think you should cross out that name. I guarantee you, Min Ja-yeong, shouldn't be on this list. Who's that? We're not looking to catch a few small fish. I'll make sure her name is taken off the list. You have my word. STATEMENT ...along with Yun Hyeong-ju, Song Chang-sik and Lee Jang-hee... You did cross out Min Ja-yeong from the list, didn't you? I mean she's only starting out... Her dream and everything... ♪ The night is deep and quiet ♪ ♪ I hear tapping on my window ♪ ♪ Unable to sleep, I look outside ♪ ♪ There is no one outside but ♪ ♪ a wedding cake on door step ♪ ♪ Who might've left it there? ♪ ♪ I am going away, my love ♪ ♪ After this night, I'm going ♪ ♪ to someone that I don't want ♪ ♪ In tears, I'm going to ♪ ♪ someone that isn't you ♪ ♪ After this night, I'm leaving for ♪ ♪ someone I'm not in love with ♪ ♪ Please let me see you ♪ ♪ one last time, my love ♪ ♪ From afar, the morning bell tolls ♪ ♪ over my broken heart ♪ ♪ I keep looking out the window ♪ ♪ hoping to catch a glimpse of you ♪ ♪ but you're long gone ♪ ♪ nowhere to be seen ♪ ♪ Only the endless tears ♪ ♪ stream down my cheeks ♪ ♪ As I gaze at the wedding cake ♪ Even after a long time, friends were the same.
