A couple of weeks ago, after we went out to a restaurant, a man with a gun tried to rob him. My dad got the gun away from him and the guy ran off. So you think she hired someone? Well, from my understanding, the guy never approached Sara, only my dad. What about the other night when someone tried to break in to your uncle's apartment? I mean, that has to have something to do with this! Random coincidence, or maybe Michael imagined it in one of his episodes. He drinks a lot, Ashley. Ever since his wife left him, he goes through a bottle a night. My dad kept trying to get him to go to rehab, but he wouldn't. Or... it's part of Sara's plan to try and get the cops off her tail. (Sara sighing) (doorbell ringing) (doorbell ringing) - Can I help you? - I have a warrant to do an additional search of the premises. I'm sorry. What's going on? Could you wait for us outside, please? Uh... I understand, but we can only do that if you maintain a balance in your money-market account. Thank you. Once the transfer's gone through, it shouldn't be a problem. Of course. You're welcome. (unsettling music) Oh, my God! Thank you so much for coming. Of course. What's going on? I don't know exactly. But I overheard and... I think they found a knife with dried blood on it. Wait, in the house? How come they didn't find that before? Apparently, it was in a hidden cupboard or something. Wherever it was, they must not have searched there the first time. What set all this off: The search warrant or Sara's arrest yesterday? I didn't catch all of it, but it sounded like they got an anonymous tip from someone that Sara threw out a bloody nightgown in the trash in the middle of the night. Babe, I hate to say this, but it's really starting to sound like she's guilty. You hired a private investigator to run a background check on Sara? She did it right after you found her. I just wanted to make sure there is nothing about her you needed protection from. There's quite a bit in there: Previous addresses, employment history, vital records. There's a lot you don't know about her. I know. I lied about a lot of things. You lied about almost everything. And what you didn't lie about, you completely made up. Yeah, I know. Why? Why would you do that to me? I came to you wanting to know who you were, what your life was like... why you gave me up. I couldn't tell you the truth: That when I got pregnant with you, I was an escort, that I don't know who your real dad is... that I'd been arrested six times and I was a drug addict. I was so happy when you found me and I just figured... I figured if you knew any of that, you would have walked away and never contacted me again. So you basically made up a person that didn't exist. No. I let you into my life the way it is now. I went to rehab and I met a guy there, and he helped me turn my life around. And a year later, I met Trevor. - That is such a load of crap! - Hey, you know what? (menacing music) You wanna know the truth about me? I'll tell you the truth. I was not a good person, Ashley. I used people. I wasted every opportunity that was given to me. I drank a lot and I did a lot of drugs. But you know what? I am not that person anymore. I am a completely different person. OK. I need you to be honest with me, for once. Did you kill Trevor? No. Then why would you throw away a nightgown with blood on it? I don't know! I didn't! I didn't! I don't even leave the house at night! Whoever called in that tip must have put it there! Somebody is trying to frame me! Don't give up on me. Please, I need you. My lawyer doesn't think I'm gonna make bail. Why not? Because a few years ago, I skipped out when I was arrested for shoplifting. (scoffing) - Geez. - My hearing is the day after tomorrow at 2 p.m. Will you be there? I don't know. Can you...? ♪♪♪ (sighing) (car door opening) - Amy? - You weren't answering my texts. I got worried. (Ashley sighing) It's been a rough 48 hours. Come on in. I wanna believe she's innocent, but, honestly, I'm not so sure anymore. And just lied about so many things. I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I think Sara's right. Someone's trying to frame her. - Why would you say that? - The knife they found, it was in a hidden cupboard. OK... I don't think that Sara even knows that cupboard exists. But more importantly, the knife was not there two days ago. And how do you know this? The night that we both ended up there at the same time, I looked in the cupboard, and it wasn't there. Nothing was. And then it magically appeared the following day. Why were you looking in there? I was looking for something that my dad would have wanted to keep hidden from Sara: Threatening letters, legal papers, I don't know. My dad used to hide gifts for my mom there when she was still alive. I didn't really expect to find anything but I... I figured it was worth a shot. - And is there anyone else who knows about it? - Not sure, but the killer obviously knew the layout of the house. Amy, you have to go to the police with this. I don't know how receptive they'll be. They think they have their person. We need something concrete. OK. Let's start by making a list of everyone that went in and out of the house. The housekeeper, she wouldn't have anything to do with this. The police, although I don't know why they would want to frame your mother. Michael? Possibly. He did use to house sit for them from time to time. You... You think I could have killed my father?! - No. I'm just saying you had access. - I loved my father! He wasn't always a good person, but he was always good to me and he did not deserve what happened to him! Look, I know it's no secret that I don't like Sara, but I do not wanna see an innocent person go to prison while the person who murdered my father is still out there! Whoever did this needs to pay. I'm sorry. I-I believe you. I... I want the exact same thing that you do. (sighing) There is another possibility. Who? I'm pretty sure my father was having an affair. I don't know who it was with, but one day we were at a restaurant, and he got a text from her while he was in the restroom. I saw it come up on his phone. So maybe her husband found out or Trevor broke it off with her and she got jealous? It's worth looking into. How do we start? So, basically, we're looking for any hotel receipts or any restaurant receipts where two people ate. There's probably a million of them, but yes. (sighing) What about your uncle? It seemed like they were pretty close. Given that Kelsie was cheating on Michael, I doubt my dad would have been likely to tell Michael he was doing the same thing to Sara. Yeah, you're probably right on that. (suspenseful music) (sinister music) (doorbell ringing) (tablet bleeping) - Michael, what are you doing here? [I need to see you.] - No, you don't. Go home. - I just lost my brother. For Christ's sake, have some compassion. I am sorry about Trevor, but nothing good is gonna come from us talking. Please, go home! How could you do that to me? How? He was my brother. I don't know what you're taking about. You're drunk! [Two people I love the most, and you betray me like that?] [How? How?!] (bottle shattering) I did everything for you. What are you talking about right now? You know what I'm talking about. Did you really think I wouldn't find out? [Of all the people] In the world, you had to choose my brother, my own brother! [Everything] That has happened has happened because of you! It is all your fault. What do you mean "everything"? ♪♪♪ - I shouldn't be here. - Michael! [Michael!] And another one from the same restaurant. Again, always paid in cash. And look, they all are between 7 and 8 p.m. Let me see. Now that's interesting. It looks like these are all with the same person. How do you know that? Well, the pasta Alfredo was ordered every single time, along with a glass of the same type of wine, a Bellay Chardonnay. Did your dad always eat the same thing? No, and he hated pasta Alfredo. See, there's a scotch and water on each of these. That's what he ordered. Ooh, can you pull up the calendar? Let's see what day of the week these all fell on. OK. Um... Thursday. This one's Thursday too. And a Tuesday, and another Thursday. So almost always on a Thursday. Tomorrow's a Thursday. I can't believe none of the servers remember by father. The hostess did say there were a lot of servers off tonight. And it doesn't exactly help that they don't keep regular hours. Hey, uh, excuse me. Have you ever seen this man before? He comes in a lot on Thursday nights. Yeah, of course. Uh, drives a Jag, always comes with a lady with dark hair, good tipper. And you say they come in together every Thursday? Yeah. Well, no. They arrive separately, but he always pays for her car too. And what type of car does she drive? A red SUV, leather interior. Did he ever mention her name? Look, nobody's gonna know the information came from you. You're not gonna get in trouble. The man in the photo, it's my father, and I desperately need to know more about the woman he was... he was dating. I guess I'm not the only one with a complicated father. Mine's been married four times. Look, I don't know her name, but I know where she works. - How? - There's a sticker, like a... like a parking pass for employees on the windshield. - Where from? - Truxton Medical Centre. ♪♪♪ OK. Thank you so much. Hey, what's wrong? Do you know who it is? It can't be. So your dad was having an affair with Michael's wife, his own sister-in-law? Sure seems that way. You didn't see what kind of car Kelsie was driving - at the funeral, did you? - No. Let's go find out. That looks like the car. Let's go see if it has the sticker on it, OK? OK. ♪♪♪ Yep. That's the parking pass. I can't believe that she would do this, that he would do this to his own brother! - I'm sorry. - Amy? - What do we do now? - I guess we ask her if she was sleeping with my father. Your father. We would meet up once a week on Thursday nights when Michael was playing racquetball. How long had the affair been going on? Two, three years before I told Michael I wanted a divorce, that I was in love with someone else. He asked me so many times who it was but, of course, I never told him. Were you planning on being together? Trevor would talk about it at times, that he wanted to divorce Sara and marry me, but I knew he wouldn't. I was content with the little time I had with him. I know it's hard to comprehend. How could he do that to Michael? But you don't know what it was like living with him. ♪♪♪ He'd... disappear for days at a time, but that was better than when he came home drunk. I was scared of him when he drank. He could be angry and violent. It was hell. There's no other way to describe it, and Trevor could understand that. One of the first reasons I started seeing him alone was to get advice on how to deal with his brother. How could you come between two brothers like that? Dad and Michael were so close. Between them? Michael despised Trevor. Trevor brought him down every chance he got, embarrassed him all the time. Michael gave him plenty of reason to. Your father constantly had to fix Michael's screw-ups. Did Michael ever find out about the affair? I didn't realize he had, - but I think so. - When? I don't know. Wait. I'm confused. How did you know that he knew? I'm not sure exactly. But you are sure. There's something you're not telling us. - No, I'm not! - Please. An innocent woman is sitting in prison right now for something she didn't do. If you believe that Michael could have anything to do with Trevor's murder, you need to tell us. I miss your father. I miss him just as much as anyone else does. It's my fault. If we hadn't had the affair, Trevor would still be alive. What do you mean? He didn't say it outright, but... I got a sense that he's the one who did it. OK. You need to tell us exactly what he said. (sighing) (alarming music) (inaudible speaking) Kelsie, you need to go to the police with this. No. I've caused Michael enough pain. I just want all of this to go away. Kelsie, we're talking about the man that you loved! Don't you want to see my father's murder solved? Of course! But if the police find evidence and a reason to arrest him, it won't be because of me. Well, what about doing the right thing? Legally, I'm still married to Michael and I don't have to testify against my husband! There's nothing to say to make me change my mind! (Ashley): She believes he did it. Yeah, but you heard her. She refuses to go to the police. Besides, what he said wasn't exactly a confession. Then we need to find proof of the affair. It gives Michael motive. Come on. (car engine revving up) (car driving by) Yeah, we have a problem. (blues music playing) ♪ It rained ♪ ♪ So much in this town ♪ (indistinct conversations) ♪ Feels like it was meant just for me ♪ Cheers. What's so urgent? I think Sara's daughter's onto us. What makes you think that? She and Amy were over at Kelsie's. How do you know that? Kelsie told you? No. I, uh... I saw them there. You were at Kelsie's? No. Yes, but I... I just wanted to make sure she was alone, OK? She didn't know I was there. Whatever, man. It's not important. The point is they were there, both of them together, probably asking questions about me. So what? Kelsie doesn't know anything, does she? Does she? No. But if Ashley thinks that Sara is innocent and if they keep digging around... They won't find anything. What if they do? What if you made a mistake? I didn't. And if you're thinking of bringing up what happened in the alley, don't. No one would predict that your brother would jump me when I had a gun. So did they find anything or not? Not yet. But I've known Amy her whole life and she is smart. Does Kelsie know something or not? No. You need to stop. The more you drink, the more of a liability you are to both of us. You're calling the shots now? Yeah. It's my neck that's on the line if you get wasted and whine to the wrong person about that affair. Go up to your cabin and dry out for a few days. Burn all those stupid photos of Trevor with your wife and get a... damned grip. You hear me? Kelsie told you that? That she thinks Michael hired someone and that she and Trevor were sleeping together? I am so sorry that we didn't believe you before, but we both believe you now. Look, Sara, obviously Michael is trying to frame you. We think that if we can go to the police with proof of the affair, then maybe they can convince Kelsie to talk. Or at the very least, just dig a little deeper into his finances and see if he could have hired someone. I always wondered if Trevor was being unfaithful. I used to call his hotel room late at night and he wouldn't pick up the phone. He always made it seem like the pills were making me paranoid. Makes sense it was Kelsie. Is there anything you can think that could help us prove to the cops that they were sleeping together? No. I think he was quite successful at hiding his affair. Maybe going through Dad's credit cards could yield something: Hotel stays, gifts. Listen to me. If Michael is capable of hiring somebody to murder his brother and framing me, he is way more dangerous than I imagined. I'm worried you two are in over your heads. If the police won't dig until they uncover the truth, then Amy and I will. (sighing) (Ashley sighing) There's nothing here. Kelsie said the affair went back three years, so... maybe we just need to check his phone records from back then. (cell phone ringing) ♪♪♪ Hey, babe. Sara's just on the news. Look at Channel 7 [on your phone.] - What? Why? She pled guilty to Trevor's murder. ♪♪♪ But seriously, why would she plead guilty? Sara's just trying to protect you. It's probably the most selfless thing she's ever done. I'm not saying Sara did the right thing, but what you two are doing is very risky. But now she's screwed. And that's why we need your help. My help? ♪♪♪ A cheque from Trevor to Michael? Where did you get this? We found it when we were going through my dad's stuff. It wasn't uncommon for him to give Michael loans. And if you look at the back, it has his account number and bank. He banks at Western National. Oh, no, Ashley, absolutely not. If you were to just check and see if there was any transfers or withdrawals... I am not gonna put my career at risk for something that probably won't yield anything useful anyway. And, sweetie, if Michael's smart, and it seems like he is, I mean, he's not gonna hire someone to murder his brother, then pay him with a wire transfer. We don't know what you'll find. I'm just saying even the smallest thing could be helpful. - The answer is no. - I mean, even Amy, who has literally every reason to side with Michael over the stepmother she can't stand, agrees. I know you don't want me involved in all of this, but I am. And, yes, it's because she's my biological mom, but I can't just sit back and let some innocent woman spend the rest of her life in prison for a murder she didn't commit. You're asking me to break the law. No. I am just asking you to look. Please? I know it's Michael. I know it's him. OK.

Remember when she said Michael would disappear for days at a time. Maybe this is where he goes. Did your dad know about it? I doubt it. He would have mentioned it. If he's hiding evidence of the murder, or the affair, or even of hiring the hit, there's a better chance that it's there than in his apartment here in Philly. What do you think?
