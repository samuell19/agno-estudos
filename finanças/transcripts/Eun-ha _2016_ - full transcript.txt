When the female guard comes ... get dressed and wait ... please just finish it quickly. Then take off your underwear. Physical examination is performed in a completely dislocated state. Okay ? He must have turned, why is he like that ? Ah, a song is coming out, a song is coming out. ♪ He gave me a bouquet of flowers ♪ ♪ Moonlight blue ... ♪ Man, the lyrics are all wrong, the one I know. Oh, too bad, too bad. What ! Seed. Too bad. Oh, I'm crazy. - What can't you do ... - Come on, come on, come on ! Come on, everyone, let's drink ! Come on, let's have a drink. Let's drink ! Oh, Seojun hyung, drink a little ! Oh, pour me some alcohol and see, huh ? Quiet ! Hey you man. Don't think of dead Jesu, you bastard. Sir, on a day like today. Why. If there are pretty prisoners, let’s meet and see. Hey, do you think that bastard will meet ? Who is that bastard ? No, there won't be many half-brothers, right ? Aww, these are the kids who come to kill people. What do you meet fuck. It's good, it's thrilling, it's good, huh ? Brother, bring it to me, I ... How can men be so alike ? But my brother is something different. A man who can't forget his dead wife. Isn't that cool ? Cool, shit. Would you like to go out with me ? Do you hate me. I don't go out with anyone ... because my brother. Special only for today. Ah, so drunk, ah ... Are you okay ? No, until things go like this. Why haven't you contacted me before ? Oh, how worried. I'm sorry. Don't you have a lawyer appointed right now ? Uh, I have a junior that I know, so I'll find out soon. Can I get out ? Oh, okay, don't worry. There's no reason to be here if you're not guilty. Thank you. Visitation time is over. Oh, yes. Wait a minute, I'll be out soon. Ai, me, Eun Ha, over there, he, if you go to a lawyer, we will meet well. Honey ... Oh, true ... 435, are you okay ? Chief, I'm sorry. Yeosa-dong #435 ... What did you come into ? Oh that pretty. Wait ... yes here it is. Fraud, What, Blackmail, Blackmail, Murder. Are you all tied up ? Oh, you know that big live fish wholesaler on the shore ? He is the suspect in the murder of President Choi. If you are CEO, you have a good reputation. Yes, it looks like a flower snake, bitter. I'm seeing this for the first time. I'm stateless. Stateless ? Hey. Hey ! Are you banging your head and just sleeping ? That bitch was walking around with a man. The bitch that killed that man because he didn't have money. There's nothing like a flat face ... this spooky bitch ... wow look at those eyes. Huh ? I'll catch someone ! Where are you twisting ? Spooky bitch, that's right. Let go ! Seed. Hey, let it go, let it go ! - Bad ! Let it go ! Let it go ! - Hey, let go, Mr. Lee, let go ! Mr. Lee. Stop the action ! Hey, you're not coming ! Subdue. Ttt, is it a legacy ? Well, I had a three month old. Fuck. Oh, if there is such a thing, shouldn't we talk about it in advance ? Stupid year. Didn't you do it gently ? No face. All right, Chief Han, do you know how well you usually do ? I don't talk anymore. I watched it 435 times anyway ... I have no nationality and my origin is unclear, so I can’t use my strength no matter where I say it. Excessive suppression, just take good care not to say anything. Put them in a solitary cell so they don't mix with other inmates ... yes ... 435, come to your senses, come to your senses ! Nurses, nurses, nurses ! 435, come to your senses ... nurse ! What are you doing ? Just let me die. 'Cause there's no reason to live anymore. Everyone lives for no reason ... if you want to die ... die out of sight ... true. That, the 435 or so girl. Not kidding ? It's going to be quite a pain in the ass, oh my. I ... Huh ? Is it very cold inside these days ? It's cold, you bastard. When did you give it to the fire ? Seed ... year goes by. Are the clothes new ? Huh ? A few days ago, my grandson gave me a new one. But why the clothes all of a sudden ? #435, going out because of an appearance in the prosecution. The fact that he escaped after killing the victim, Choi Byeong Hyeon, around 18:00 on March 26. Right ? Planned offenses aimed at victims' property. Right ? Hey Eun Ha Lee. The right to remain silent is when you have someone to defend you. People with no nationality like you. Being here in itself is a crime. Wouldn't it be better for you to just cooperate when you say something nice ? Fish oil, I'm sure this. Do whatever you want ... what ? I want you to take care of yourself. Uh, uh, uh, draw it. Enjoy your meal. - Eat well, you too. - Enjoy it. Hey, 435, is he a real flower snake ? Oh, how many years have we been on this floor ? Huh ? Just by looking at it, you can see each ... huh ? Huh ? Eh ? What ? 435 Horse. Isn't he a bit strange ? What ? The kid is a little cold. What are those flower snakes ? Is it his distinctive color ? There's something hot ... 'cause he doesn't. Oh yeah ... Are you really going to say nothing ? I want to help, but I can't do anything like this. Oh, why are you giving up so quickly ? If it goes on like this, you could get a really heavy sentence. Death penalty is better. Lawyer ! Yes ? #435 Eun Ha Lee, how about you ? Well, I have no will. I guess you don't want to argue. Do you see someone you know ? I have no nationality and this is my first case like this. If you don't say anything like that, even if you prepare well, you won't be able to ... I have no idea what to do. The first trial is just around the corner. Good work. Yes, wait a minute. Ah ... Yes, bring this later. Get in here. He's coming soon. Please wait a minute. Yes, thank you. Wake up all. Oh, sorry for this. Am I too late ? Oh, it's okay ... ah. Oh, what should I say about this first ? Eun Ha's mother was a defector ... defecting to China and there. I met a North Korean defector in the same situation. A galaxy was born between them. When Eun Ha was 12, the two died in a car accident. From then on, Eun Ha wandered through China and Southeast Asia. He came to Korea. But why no nationality ? What could a runaway parent do ? Well, now the treatment of refugees and North Korean defectors has improved. Well, that's something you might need to know. Oh, Korea ... Eun Ha's mother wanted to come like that. If you go there, it will definitely be warm. Said she would welcome. So her mother died. Ha, she came to Korea, which she wanted so much. This country called Korea is very demanding. So nobody accepts it. Eun Ha was not recognized as a Korean. The reason was that it was a time when the North Korean defector issue was sensitive. In the end I wanted. The application to acquire Korean citizenship was rejected. Well, and I left here about a year ago ... there was no hope. Most people expected that it would go well when they came to Korea. When I get rejected, the disappointment is so great that I can't stand it. All seated. Case No. 2014 Gohap 487 ... charged with murder ... I will start the trial of the defendant Lee Eun Ha. Did the accused Eun Ha Lee ever work at a witness's shop ? Yes, that, the first time I saw it. He looked pretty, but he was too skinny. It looked kinda bad, so he let me work in our store. How was the first meeting between the defendant and CEO Choi Byeong Hyeon ? Please explain ... that ... Oh, that same day, the boss came to eat alone. Eun Ha was in charge of serving. The boss was very nice and gave me tips. But when the boss left, Eun Ha suddenly followed. I just got into the car recklessly. So I just dried it. 'I'm sorry' and. The boss just laughed. Choi Byeong Hyeon, the president of the accused, found a house. When did you find out ? That rumor has been circulating since about a year ago. Eun Ha said that she seduced her boss and got a house. Did you know that CEO Choi Byeong Hyeon was threatened ? Yeah, ah, some kind of video. I'm going to go to the boss' house and send it to the broadcasting station. So the boss couldn't move and listened to everything. Submit as video evidence. This video was filmed with the defendant's mobile phone. It was exploited as a weakness of President Choi Byeong Hyeon. Summarizing the testimony of the witnesses. Defendant Lee Eun Ha seizes the man's weakness and continues to threaten him. Getting what you need. It can be said to be a type of typical flower snake. I didn't want something to go wrong. I didn't know it would turn out like this. Eun Ha is by no means a flower snake-like child. May I ask you a pretentious question ? The guard said that this country is now. Do you believe you are protecting yourself ? Yes, of course. Then what if the ship the prison guard was riding on sank ? Or the house you used to live in is the target of demolition. Or if a nuclear power plant explodes. Do you think this country will protect you even then ? A person's human rights. You can never take precedence over the state. Stateless people or refugees are nothing special. If the state doesn't protect us. We too become stateless ghosts. Don't even give up on you because of the child ... you are still alive. Say there's no guilt. What do you think you know about me ? Even if you say things like me, you don't believe anything. You wanted this too. Yes ? Chief Han ? Uh, what did you hear ... effort ... don't make excuses ... just admit it. There's no win for you anyway ... in this narrow area ... that the person tried to kill your baby. If there are rumors like that. Me and my kids can't live here. Even rural people like us can live without money. I can't live with shame. If you admit what you did ... I'll help you get the sentence down. I didn't kill. I didn't kill you ... you know all that ... no. I didn't kill you ... you killed it ... no. I didn't kill. Murderer. I didn't kill you ! I didn't kill you ! I didn't kill you ! 435 ! Calm down ... 435, come to your senses, come to your senses ! Fuck who are you ? Which bastard interviewed the victim's family ? Aren't you working right ? Victims' families don't know it's forbidden to visit ! Since they are just acquaintances here, of course ... If you're going to do that, you'll hit everything, these babies ... 어, 몸은 좀 괜찮아 ? 여기 아무도 없으니까 푹 쉬어 ... 조금만 ... 더 같이 있어 주면 안 돼요 ? Hello ... me. Hey, you ... Why are you like this these days ? What ? Oh, since when did you start taking care of the prisoners like that, huh ? Hey, do you know what they say ? 435 flirts with you. He said he ate it all, including the liver and gallbladder. Let's stop. Hey, aren't you sorry for your dead Jesu ? No, eat something with a flower snake, Mr. Lee ! Talking hard. Stop it. Stop what, what ! Yes, you are now. Now that I've tasted a woman, I think it's because. Don't trust those bitches, huh ? They didn't come here for nothing. I have a naive baby like you ... 개털린 새끼들도 수두룩 빽빽이라고 새끼야, 알아 ! 아유 ! 한국 국적 신청이 반려되고 ... 난민센터에서 나오게 되면서 When you are lonely and need someone to lean on. It is true that I received help from President Choi Byeong Hyeon. There is no evidence anywhere that the defendant made threats. The video footage was actually filmed with whose cell phone. It's not clear. As can be seen from the fact I just said. The defendant is not Korean. I am a stateless person who does not belong anywhere in the world. In other words, the current defendant's identity itself is illegal. If you are in this status. The likelihood of a crime appears to be very high. It is not his will that the defendant be stateless. It's just that we're exposed to loopholes in the current national legal system. Associating it with the likelihood of a crime is an overstatement. So, can it be said that the defendant's condition is legal now ? It's not a matter that can be judged by such black-and-white logic. Statelessness should be solved by all of us ... This is not a refugee tribunal. Speak only about whether the accused has committed a crime. Defendant, make a final plea. Defendant ... defendant. Please argue something. You didn't do anything wrong, right ? Yes. Without ... how a person's existence. Could it be illegal by itself ? I live here ... baby in my womb. I had a right to live. He tried to kill my baby ... I just ... baby in my womb. I just wanted to protect. Are there any strange rumors circulating these days ? What rumor are you talking about ? You said that you take good care of me 435 times ? I didn't tell you to take good care of it. Don’t say any more, behave well. Yes. You've been doing well, so why are you like this these days, puberty ? What's wrong ? Why is your expression like that ? No. I don't know what's wrong with me ... you only live once. If you pay attention to useless things, you miss out on important things. Then you look like me, huh ? Taeha ... Taehaya. Taehaya. Taehaya. Tae Ha, Tae Ha. Whew. I envy you, no matter who you are. Aww, oppa. Oh, why, what's going on, huh ? Oppa, wake up. What is it ? This gentleman, where are you like this, huh ? Come grab a drink and listen. Aww, what ... Oppa, wake up ! Come quickly. Oh, why did you drink so much ? Why are you making such a face ? Hey, but what time is it now ? What is the importance of time ? Go fast. Where ? Oh, where are you ? You know that ... go wherever you want to go ... at least not here. Do I really have to do it like this ? Fuck ... sorry. I haven't seen you. I When that person has a child. He thought he wanted to live for the first time ... so to that person. He asked me to adopt a child. If you said you would know before ... Oh my, you look so happy. Let's try. Now, I have submitted all the necessary documents. You have to wait for the results. Can I get self-defense recognition ? In fact, it is true that all of these situations are against us. CEO Choi will also use his hand. If it is not recognized as a legitimate defense. Probably at least 6 or 7 years. But it will be fine. You deserve that. One person died. In the meantime, let’s find a way to acquire Korean citizenship. When you fill out your sentence ... I'll definitely give it to you as a gift, resident registration card ... uh, that bathroom. Yes, I'll see you in court. Yes, you did a good job. Yes. You did a great job. Why am I so clueless, this ? Ha, I am ... Thank you. I want to live again. Not because of my nationality, but because of me. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. The defendant has since February 2013 ... for one year until February 2014. Threatening Choi Byeong Hyeon. Continuously extorting money worth 100 million won ... was provided with a living space ... also get pregnant. He threatened Choi Byeong Hyeon to adopt a child. When a quarrel broke out, he killed Choi Byeong Hyeon and then fled. In the sense that all these crimes were done under a thorough plan ... very bad quality. Moreover, since the crime was committed in the status of a stateless person without nationality ... It causes the social seriousness of non-Korean crimes in Korean society. Therefore, the accused is sentenced to life imprisonment. No. 435 Lee Eun Ha moves to Ki Kyeon Soo’s room. When my brother is confirmed, I have to move. Don't touch it ! - Oh, really. - I'm leaving here. Don't touch it ! - Be still ! - Don't touch it ! I want to go out now. I want to live ... move out of the room ... let's find a solution ... will die. Rather let me die. Why are you doing this to me ! What are you doing ! Don't come close ... I'm going to die, I'm going to die ! Moving rooms is not important. After all, the female weapon-bearer has to move to another place. You know that. Just ... wherever you travel ... uh ? When you come, everything will be sorted out. I will take good care of the director. Thank you. But I'll take care of my business ... oh really. Oh, I don’t know. Hey you do it yourself. What's wrong with that ? Oh, what did you do over there, the weapon came out ? I didn't know how to handle it to this extent. I'll have to prepare an appeal soon. Appealing probably won't change much. Oh, what do you mean ? Of course I should appeal, I'm not guilty, why ? Seniors. I don't think I can make it this far ... uh ? To be honest, even if I take this to an appeal, it won't do me any good. It's not getting public attention. Hey, are you talking about that now ? You know there's nothing good about being a judge in the local community, right ? I have to eat too. Everyone is like me. Why are you chasing a foreigner who has no nationality ? Even if I appeal, I am not confident. There is no favorable evidence, and there is already a lot of evidence over there. When doing it wrong ... There could be a death penalty. What, sa, the death penalty ? Yes. Hmm, over there, Chief Han ... what ? Here. Now you're saying the death penalty ? You haven't been instructed recently ! It's a higher order, hand it over to the person in charge. Who did it ? Who the hell made you kill Jeong Man Ho ? ! No one has the right to kill this person recklessly. What power do we have ? If you do it above, you do what you say. Who the hell is up there ? Hey, what's wrong with this, huh ? Is it time for one of our chiefs to die ? Well, I have this much. Okay, where can I try it ? Hey ... delicious, um ... you eat too. Yes. I'm going to get a good night's sleep today thanks to one of the chiefs, huh ? Thank you ... it's ok, chief ... because it's okay. It's too unfair to give up like this ... Eun Ha is never that kind of child. You know ? That the child is innocent. No, I'm losing my billions. But overturning this one heart is itself. They have to prove their incompetence. Oh, who's willing to take it ? Anyways anyway. Ha, I'm not interested. I just think of it as a nuisance. For those who don't have a single vote. I don't want to do that annoying thing until I get the hate of other voters. Ha, tuk, more than once I was involved in a crime like this. There is no hope in Korea. When the first nationality application is rejected. Why did you stop trying to go to a third country ? I'm so sorry. No, this is ... Why do you need it ? Please do. Wow ... crazy, this. Help me just once ... hard work. Yes, thank you. Go. I got it the hard way. I ... please take care of that child. Well, what to me ... I'm just connecting. Please take care of me later. Oh, baby, you work hard. Oh, nice to meet you, right ? Baby, what's wrong with the guy who comes every time ? Take a dive, yeah. Oh yes, hello. Yes. Please enter. Well then, work hard, yes ... well then ... 435, interview with a lawyer. Yes. I'll go. Yes, here it is. Let's go ... don't answer, listen ... you will get out of here. If you leave, go straight to the port. It's the boat ticket and ID. I'm going to the port and taking a boat to Laos. Apply for asylum with this ID ... change into this. Come on, no time ! Listen carefully ... if you leave here ... never contact me. If you know where you are people will go get you. I can't get away from here. What are you going to do ? 'cause I'll figure it out ... take this too ... still. You're leaving here today, huh ? Your life that has only suffered so far. I'm starting over. Go to a place no one knows. I have to meet good people and live happily. I do not like it. I do not like it ... sorry. I can't keep my promise. Hurry. Yes, please hurry up, yes, I have a lot of places to stop by. Yes. I have too much work. Baby ... yes it is ... good work. - Good job. - Yes, good job. I Charm. Child, child, the door is open, look at my mind. Stop moving ! You bastard, why are you doing this, huh ? Ha, don't do this. It won't be a big deal. Shut your mouth and raise your hand. Otherwise, fuck it, it really shoots ! Hey wait. Shut your mouth and raise your hand. Otherwise, Mr. I'll really fire. Don't do this, it won't matter. Put the gun down, huh ? Raise your hands and get down on your knees ! Fuck it, really ! Go quickly, come on, come on ! Everyone stop ... otherwise shoot. Seo Joon A ... stop ... let's stay like this for a moment. Wait a moment ... I'm stuck. I can't go anyway ! Done. 'Cause I can't see anything right now ... be still ... you sir ... Why are you doing this, huh ? Until the end of your life ! Fuck it, it doesn't matter ... just let him go. So I think I'll live. Inmate's vehicle moving ... what kind of bastard Don't put down the walkie-talkie ! Catch it, catch it, hurry up and stop that car ! Hurry up and catch him, Mr. Oh shit, you boring bastard ... you are old or now. It's so frustrating, fuck you ! What, this ? AC No, it's another girl ... you ...

You guys go the opposite way, Mr. Hurry up and find some, quick, quick ! Are you really crazy ? No, I think he's already gone. Fuck, where are you going, find it quickly ! Is it worth it ? Hey, it's been a while. I'm back to work here. Hey, it's when you go out ... send me back to work ... time goes well. I'm sorry, even you because of me. Oh, no. How long left ? Suffered ... oh hey this. Will Taeha bring you this ? But Seo Joon A. Why did you do that then ? Well. Oh my, my, my, my, my gosh. Hey, I haven't even reported it yet. I'm meeting you. Goes. Thank you. My friend
