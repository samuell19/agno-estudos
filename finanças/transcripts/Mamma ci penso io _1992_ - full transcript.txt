If anything happens to him... I swear to you I am going to find you, Miss Sanchez, and the entire staff of the American embassy responsible. MAN: Any way you look at it, boy running away is a big problem. I'm in permanent contact with the police. He'll show up sooner or later. Let's go. MIGUEL: Nobody gives diamonds away. ANGELITA: Still, his mother is in prison for diamond smuggling. MIGUEL: That's true. MIGUEL: You have to give us more if you want us to help you. I have this. No... How do you expect us to help you, if you don't have any dollars? I'll get you all the dollars you want, but first we have to find that doll vendor and get my mom out of jail. I don't usually work that way. But I give you a chance. MIGUEL: How much money do you think you can get? Five? [EL GORDO WHISTLES] - Five dollars? - DANNY: No, no, no. Five... Hundred.

[PEARL LAUGHS] He's fat, has a big head, and goes around with a cart full of dolls. If you see him, you'll recognise him immediately. He sort of looks like a big doll of himself.

[UPROAR] [INDISTINC CLAMOUR] [MAN SHOUTS] [SHOUTING] [YELLING ANGRILY IN SPANISH] DANNY: I don't understand, the doll he gave my sister was full of diamonds. MIGUEL: What's there to understand? I told you, no one in their right mind goes around giving diamonds away. DANNY: Lay off Miguel! Why would I lie, when my own mother's life is at stake? ANGELITA: He's right. MIGUEL: He could be using his mother as an excuse, and still be lying. I'm not a liar. Okay, okay, I believe you. Let's follow him! [SEAGUL] [WAVES CRASHING] [CLAPS HANDS] Hey! What are you stopping for? We're going to lose him! Hey Danny look! The ocean! What's the big deal? It's the first time they've ever seen the ocean. CHILDREN: Yes! Look at all that water! [INDISTINCT CLAMOUR FROM GROUP] [RADIO PLAYING SPANISH MUSIC] Because of him my mother is in jail. He's a coward that's what he is. DANNY: He gave my sister a doll filled with diamonds and they arrested my mother for smuggling. Then your son ran away, disappeared on me didn't you? You coward. Yes, yes it's true... [LOUD SLAP] Now my mother is in jail. [LOUD SMACK] [CLAMOUR OF THINGS FALLING] [YELLING] Time to tell the truth! Speak! [RESIGNED] Okay, okay. But I'm not guilty. There are some guys who works in the airport. He gives me those dolls to give to another person. Why do you do it? For money! He gave me money. [OBJECTS SMASH] [CHEERING FROM THE CHILDREN] [UPBEAT MUSIC FROM RADIO] [DOOR SLAMS] WOMAN: What? Sure I know him he's my client. A real gentleman. Both he and his friend. He shows up every few weeks or so. Very elegant, always dressed in black. Buys a thousand or so dolls at a time. And always pays much more than their worth. He drives a big American car. I don't know what his name is. He never told me and I never asked. But I remember he talks with a Maracaibo accent. He's not from Caracas, of that I'm sure of. Especially because of that enormous ring that he wears. It's square. It has many diamonds with an emerald in the middle. [CHILDREN CHEER] [ALL TOGETHER]: Cheese! Mommy! JANE: Pearl! I missed you. PEARL: I love you! JANE: I love you too darling! [JANE SIGHS] So, you still haven't found him? COUNSEL: No news is good news. Police are still looking for him. There's been no reports of any drownings no abductions. Nobody matching his description has shown up in the morgues. - I'd say that's good news, wouldn't you? - No. Mrs. Morris we have a pretty good idea of what our strategy for your defense is going to be. - But uhm... - But what? But, we need money. What do you expect me to do about it? My credit cards are lost and I've run out of cash. Don't worry Jane. Call me at the embassy I'll get you what you need. LAWYER: Alright. Mom, when's Danny coming back? I don't know sweetheart. I wish I did. I'm tired of watching TV all by myself. JANE: Awww. Don't you like staying with Rebecca? [PEARL WHISPERS] [SATISFIED] Hmmph. GUARD: Oww. GUARD: Aha! What now? Is your father a millionaire? - No. - Then why isn't he with you? He doesn't live with us anymore. We only get to see him every now and then. He has another family now I guess we're not as important to him as we used to be. If I was a millionaire... I'd go on an airplane. Somewhere... You don't have to be a millionaire to go on an airplane trip. For kids like us, plane tickets cost less than half. You're pulling my leg. DANNY: No, it's true. ANGELITA: Do you like Caracas? DANNY: I love it. All the sky scrapers remind me of New York. Is that the only reason? No! I like hanging out in the hide out with all you guys. You have a nice smile Danny. DANNY: What kind of smile? ANGELITA: It's hard to describe... But I like it. Miguel has a nice smile too, but it's different than yours. What about the others? El Gordo stinks! I'm really glad I met you. - I really am. - Me too. What's the thing you want more than anything in the world? To get my mother out of jail, and you? Ice cream, at the Melia swimming pool. MIGUEL: Danny do you understand what you have to do now? Yep. MIGUEL: Then go. DANNY: Excuse me. Could you tell me how to get to the hotel Hilton? LADY: Oh yes, I live there. You take a straight, and you go to the stop light, and... [YELLING] Tyson! [YELLING] Tyson! He's got my dog. [YELLING] My baby! That's my dog! DANNY: I'll get him! [WOMAN SHRIEKS] LADY: Tyson! Tyson!

Yeah, how do you do it? DANNY: I paid. You paid! You paid! [UPROAR] MIGUEL: With what, credit card? Money. MIGUEL: Which money? The money from the lady with the dog. Lady dog! I'm not trusting you any more gringo. How about a Cascos de Guayaba? Yuck! What's that? Would you like a chocolate cake? I don't want it. I'm going to have a cochitos de jamon. It's a nice place, isn't it? No. May I present, Miguel Marquez. Son of the ambassador of Guatemala. DANNY: Angelita Soriano, daughter of the Argentian ambassador.

I'm not his daughter, in case you're interested. They're not even husband and wife. Stop embarassing the waiter Pearl. It's true they just drag me along so that people don't know that they're sleeping together. My name is Pearl Morris, my mother's name is Jane. She's in jail for smuggling diamonds. She'll have a cachito too. Thank you. [SPLASH] - Are you American? - Yes. Can I touch your muscles? - Yes. [HE EXHALES] You're strong. [WHOLF WHISTLES] MIGUEL: Wow... MIGUEL: Oh!

You promised me, I want to go to the pool now! - Please take her to the pool dear. - I'm eating. Please. Only for a little while. See you later Rebecca. I don't have enough money. I never thought it would cost this much. What shall we do? [ANGELITA CHUCKLES] [WOMAN SCREAMS] MAN: What's happening mamma? [SPLASHES] [INDISTINCT SCREAMS] [INDISTINCT SCREAMS] I think I saw Danny... Not likely. [MAN YELLS] What is going on out here? - Mr. Morris, sir, what's the problem? DANNY: Stop them, they've gone crazy! WOMAN: I can't believe it sir! They peed in the pool! Well actually, everybody pees in the pool. Don't you? But not from the edge and in front of everybody! [WAITERS YELLING] Thank you Danny. I had a wonderful, wonderful time. ANGELITA: I have a surprise for you. DANNY: Really? ANGELITA: Tomorrow you can go see your mother in jail. DANNY: That's impossible! I don't believe you. DANNY: Are you serious? It's a miracle, how did you do it? A man who's wife is in jail, he'll take you with him. DANNY: You did this for me? What if they recognise me? And turn me over to the police, I'm still blonde and American looking. They'll know it's me. Not a problem. DANNY: You are the sweetest, kindest girl. Not only in Caracas, but in all South America. If not in the world. WOMAN: Come on... WOMAN: Come on, don't worry. [WOMEN GIGGLE] You're going to meet my family it's a beautiful - [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] JANE: Yes! WOMAN: Beautiful family...

DANNY: H-h-have you tried the machine? MANOLITA: I'll go and try. [COIN DROPS] I know that sooner or later he'll get me out. What's driving me crazy is that Danny's out there, you know? And something might happen to him. [LAUGHING] It's ridiculous... He's able to find me all by himself, and you with the help of the police are still unable, to find an eleven year old child. I just... [TEARFUL] I'm just so afraid of what might happen to him, that I can't sleep at night. You just have no idea how horrible this has been for me. Believe me, I sympathise with you Mrs. Morris. But on the other hand, the police are scoring the city, so something's bound to come up soon. Do you have children? Unfortunately not. No children.
