Many years ago, there was an adventurous boy and his name was Wim. And Wim had two very good friends. They were called Jet and Gijs. Wim, Jet and Gijs really got along well together. Wim even sat with Jet in the classroom, and Jet's father was the head master. The head master taught the children to read in a special way. But, at the beginning of this story, Wim didn't know this special way. Wim, that's me, could not read a letter yet, because he did not go to school. He had never even seen the inside of one. Wim come along. Come this way. Well, come on.

Then you can still practice a bit. Wim? I do not think so. Come on, you. Wait now. You cannot treat a child that way. Oh, no? Why not? - Come here. - No. - Move. - Let me go.

They might if you fed them some more. Some already fall down by the afternoon. Well, they have more than enough. Have you heard of the new law? Law? What? What new law? Children under 12 have to go to school soon. Oh, but not the orphans. Yes, them too. All children under 12. At least, that is what the new law says. Why should those children go to school? Then who would we have to work? Can we go to school? There's a new law. What is a law? I do not know, but it says children under 12 must attend school. Heaven, then we all do not have to do dirty chores. I want to be a driver. - Shoemaker. - Captain. If you went to school, you could do anything. - Bakerwoman. - Teacher. Dancer. - Fire brigade. - Shop girl. Silence! Sleep! School? Wim! Anything? Absolutely everything. Come on, wake up! Come on! Hup, hup. Move. Hup, hup, hup. Hup, hup, hup! - Keep moving. - Line up. Line up, line up, line up, line up. There you are now. Fast. You know how much that man costs? Good day, Doctor. How great to see you again. Yes. Which child is sick? Nobody. No one is ever sick here. No, I need to ask you something, something very important. - It's like this, Doctor. - Yeah. Uh, we have a little problem with our children. But, that little problem may become a bigger problem, unless... you do something about it. Uh-huh. Dear children, none of you know exactly how old you are. Uh, yes. That happens when you are in an orphanage, which is a pity of course. Because it's not really fun to guess whether you are 5 or 6 or 11 or 12? And that is why I have asked our dear Doctor Stump... to determine how old you really are. Yes, go ahead. Open. - Open. - Ah. - Well? - Eight. Eight? Oh. - Hm? - Next one. - Open. - Ah. - Eight. - Eight? - Nine. - Oh. Next one. Oh, nine. - Nine? - And a half. - Oh. - Nine and a half. - Nine And a half. - Yeah.

I'm 10. - Pardon? - Ten and a half at most. - Not twelve. - Shut your mouth. I'm not gonna shut up. When I say that I am ten then that is true. Listen up, little boy. I'm the doctor here, and when I say you are 12-- Then you are not telling the truth. I'm ten and before that, I was nine. - And then eight, seven and six-- - I will teach you some manners. No. - Come with me. - Next one. I know why I'm 12. Then I can not go to school and I have to work. - But, I'm pretty sure I'm ten. - Oh yeah? Here. Have you ever seen your birth certificate? What birth certificate? What does it matter? You cannot read it anyway. In you go. - Tibor. - What? Where can I find such a birth thing? Search good. Birth Certificate. Here, look. Oh, no. Of course, you can not read. Oh, would you look at that. This is Wim's. Oh, he just asked about it. Ten years, two months and eleven days. Too bad, Wim. Good riddance. - Oh, Tibor. - Yeah. We're going to have a lot of years to enjoy our orphans. And with a lot of money for Paris. In the city of lights... and the avenues and theaters... and champagne. Oh, Tibor, wouldn't that be wonderful? Oh, Delphine. It would be wonderful. Yeah! Eh, ah. Come on. Hurry up. - Good day. I'm Delphine, - They already are there. headmistress here. Rub on.

Nothing at all. No, exactly. But on that finger was once a ring. And it was stolen. By Wim. Where, where could he go? Good day, teacher. It is good that you want to go to school, but the woman at the orphanage is required to approve. But she does not approve of this. She would rather keep the small children in the factory. And they couldn't do anything there. Can I maybe come live with you? That would be nice, wouldn't it, Wim? Oh, no. Get him. Come here. - Go away. - Get him. Just go away, man. Get him. Get him.

Ten, I think. Then you're too old for school. How old are you then? Also ten. But, I've been there for four years. - Here. - Thank you. You could also become a farmer. Just like Gijs. I want to learn to read, calculate, and write. There is simply nothing more beautiful. There is nothing I would rather do, Jet. How do you know my name? I'm repeating what I heard. I'm gonna go.

Who is that? - Wim. - He is skinny. Yeah. That's because he's from the orphanage. - Hi. - Hi. But, what is he doing here then? He wants to join our class. - What's this? - A sum. Three hundred seventy-two divided by twelve. You can not share with that many. What bread can you share like that? What is that? That is the map of the Netherlands. It seems like the Netherlands has measles. - Ooh. - Oh. How do you do that? - What's your name? - Wim. This is the W. From wind and sausage. And warm mittens. And now, it says Wim. I write my own name. I write my own name. Where did that crazy beast come from? Look, he can count. Quick, the master. Come on, quickly. No, in here. And don't move. So. Did you solve the division? Um... we have not started yet. - How can that be? - Um, there was a strange bird. - Yes, with weird colors. - Yes, that's better than a sum, of course. Yeah. You don't learn to count from a strange bird? - No. - No. Good. 372 divided by 12 is... Antje? - Thirty-one, sir. - Very good. Afternoon, master. Good afternoon. - Master? - Antje? - May I stay to finish my work? - Me too? Well, are we diligent today? That's fine. - What do we do? - Just wait. Stay there, Wim. We will be right back.

Your brain doesn't know a desert yet. So come. Point to the desert. No. I don't feel like it. Then you'll just have to go back to the orphanage. You are strict. Right. I am very strict. Well, where is the desert? There. Do you see that you can do it? You're really smart... for an orphan. Thank you. I have an idea. I'm going to ask my father if you can stay. Really?

He managed to escape from prison. Without keys. And he stole the ring from the director of the orphanage. Those kind of kids are best kept under lock up. That is for the best. Mm, that's true. Sad, but true. How old is he? The Orphanage says 12 And his name is Wim. So, if you see him-- You know all the kids from the neighborhood. And I know where to find you. Come, Ot. I know a nice spot. ♪ It rains, it rains, the pans get wet ♪ How did it go? Can I go to school? Are you a thief? Did you steal a ring? No, really, no. What ring? From the director. - Who says that? - The policeman, Zonet. I have never stolen. Except a bread... when the monkey was very hungry. Are you 12? I am not 12. I'm 10. I'm not a thief either. If I am, you can drown me in a chamber pot. Or push me into a bath full of cow piss. Disgusting. And then make me drink a sip. You're really crazy, you know. I can not ask anymore... if you can go to school. If I do, then Dad will take you to the police. - Hello. - Good morning. Good day. I have mail. Please. Postman. - Yes? - What does it say? Uh, "Greetings from Jet". It's beautiful. Hey! Must it be so hard on them? They do their best. Good morning, ladies. Oh, Bella. Lightning! What is that doing there? Jet, there is a monkey here. Come on. Don't, he bites. He better not try. Do you you like a nut? No, don't do that. Nice huh? Yes, let's see where you're nesting. Gijs, Gijs, no. Who are you? This is Wim, Gijs. - What is he doing here? - Wim comes from the city. From the orphanage? - He is that scoundrel. - No, Gijs, wait. - He is here to learn. - Learn how? Here in the barn? No, at Jet's school. But, I live here. Do you really have no parents? No, never had any. The orphanage was not fun, Gijs. They worked there ten hours a day. So what? What is wrong with that? - And they beat them. - How hard? As hard as the man with the team beats his horses. Look. Read what I wrote. I cannot read. - Can you do addition for me? - No. You can't count either? No. I'd rather be with the animals. Gijs is a farmer. And that is difficult enough. He can stay, right? I would let you stay, too. I'm with Teun. That's my family. Summer is coming. You'll get very busy. Teun is already old. You could use some help, right? From Wim? What does he know about farming? He can't do anything, right? Can't he learn it? - From whom? - From you, of course. You've been a farmer. He's really not stupid. He has already learned to write. So you think, milking is as easy as writing? Just give him a chance. OK, but he must learn everything. Lesson one: Milking. This is empty. Like so. Just pick one. That one over there. That's a bull. Learned something new! How do you get chocolate milk? Then you must have brown udders. For chocolate milk, you have to pull hard. Oh, what a pity. She pooped out the chocolate. Oh. Oh, no. Ah, Jet. I'm not a farmer. Are you almost done? Then I'm going to check, okay? Almost. Yes. The O is not nicely round. The A, the A is fine. Is fine? Is fine? Miss, this is best. What should I do? Insert stick into the hive and take out the honey. Don't they sting? Not if you keep quiet. I see nothing. Then you have to stick it in further. Sweet. Get away. Get away! Ow. Ow! They sting. Ow! Go away, you rotten beasts. - Ow! - Wim. Get in the water. Go away. You failed, Wim. Gijs, why did you do that? Gijs really didn't mean it that way. I can't be a farmer. It's far too hard. I'm going to find a boat. I'll be a sailor. At least, I'll be something. But, Wim, if you stay, you can learn reading, math, writing, and farming. Then you definitely have a chance to stay. I'll only do it if it has nothing to do with bees and bulls. Agreed. Agreed. Come on. For Gijs. For Jet. They taste good, Wim. I got one. Now you. Who can find the most in one minute. One, two, three, four... - Eleven... - Jet, catch. twelve, thirteen... Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nine-- Hey! Ow! I've never seen you here before. What's your name? Wim. Wim? - Good evening everyone. - Good Evening, officer. Jet, who is this? This is Wim. And he lives here in the barn. Did you know? So, that's where all those sandwiches went to, Jet? - Is that Wim from the orphanage? - But he is not a crook. Really not, Father. No, don't. Now, tell us, Wim. Where did that come from? I do not know, master. Not really. Where do you sleep, little man? Look at that. Look at that. Our Easter eggs. But, Wim didn't steal all that, did he? No, Jet. The monkey did that for him. But, Wim has trained him. Is that true? Did you train that monkey to steal? No. He did it himself. I did not even know he could. Well, little man... you don't even believe that yourself? Hup. Come. Well, now... finally something happened here. Well, Wim, go inside. So. You too. Hup, go inside. Oh. Sit. So. Hurry up. Hup. Wim! Wim? That is not possible at all. - I got that-- - Silence. Order in the court. Next case. The theft of a watch, a silver fork, and a pearl necklace. Plus 11 painted Easter eggs. How old are you? About 10, sir. - Maybe, 11. - About? Maybe? - Don't you have a birth certificate? - No, sir. - Madam. - Your Honor. I want to know how old that boy is, because of the punishment I'm about to give. Do you have his birth certificate? Yeah. No, yes. But, the thing is-- Well, what about it? Do you have it or don't you? Unfortunately. No, unfortunately. Wim was brought to us without a birth certificate. That is very unfortunate, particularly in light of this. Huh? Wim, you can already read a little? Pretty good, sir. Read this out loud. Ha! Reading? Yeah. Children's law passed. Children up to 12 years old... are compulsory school attendance. So if you find out how old you are, you might go to school. But first, you must now go back to the orphanage. Sir? What? That monkey has to go. Take it to the zoo. Next case. The Verbruggen case. Come on. Go on, walk. Not so slow. Come on, get to work. Come on, hurry up. Yes, hop to it. Shoot. Hurry even a little, man. Come on. You're at work you know. I don't think so. Oh, what a coincidence! This is yours. Oh, that's your birthday. Totally forgotten. And what do we do with that? - No! - Yes. And gone it is. Now, nobody knows when you were born. No, it is not. I was born on September 15, 1889. The Headmaster will find the truth. - Then I can go to the class with him, - Tibor! and then live with Jet. And why would your Headmaster do that? You're just an ordinary thief from an orphanage, huh? I am not. Yes, give him a thrashing. Connect tonight with his past and let it count for three offenses. - Yes, what are you waiting for? - Well, Come. Uh, come here. After everything we've done for those children, and this is the thanks we get. No, Mr. Wim prefers to run away. It's the first child in all these years. It gives the other children ideas, Tibor. Pretty soon the tent here will be empty. But by then, we are long gone together in Paris, right, Delphine? Excuse me? Oh, you and I... together on an avenue, with all those electric lights... and a glass of champagne. Do you really think... that I would go to Paris with a bumpkin like you? You can't even write, let alone speak French. I'm tired. Good night. Buzz off. So, you have... been to school? Yes. Was that difficult? The reading... and writing and stuff? Can't you do it? No. Not even your own name? I usually just put a cross. T... I... B... O... R. Look. Here is your name. Now, you. Is that the, the T? Yeah. I can write T. - I can write T. - Hold on. I would not be satisfied with just one letter. We still have I-B-O-R. Ah. I-B-O-R. Well... the O is not completely round. No. There is not one true characteristic of A. But otherwise, it's not bad for a beginning pupil, Tibor. Mm. Do I really have to go line up for that adoption? Nobody comes for me anyway. Let's do it. Otherwise, she'll start grumble again, right? So, here. - Hup. - Ow! Hurry up. Yeah. Very well. Guys, all rub up. Welcome. Welcome. How do you do? How do you do? Voilà. Boys, girls. Rene, he must be a healthy child. - I could not take a sick-- - Sure, sweetheart. Darling, we will have him immediately examined by the doctor, hm? I think that one has fleas. It does not look clean. Hey. That one looks strong. Good afternoon. - Wim, you have a chance. - They Look nice. You're really lucky. Good day. What's your name? Wim, ma'am. I'm Madeleine. How old are you, Wim? I was born on September 15, 1889. Where? I do not know. But, I'm ten plus a bunch of days. And, and Wim, when was the last time you were sick? I have never been sick. Do you see that gorilla? I can push him with one hand on his back. Would you like to come live with us? Do you know Jet? - Jet? - Yes, Jet. And Gijs and Ot and Sien and Bella, Johanna, Ella eleven-- - Ella eleven? - That's a cow. No, Wim. We don't know that cow. But if I live with you, can I go to school? It looks like you lose. Good luck, Wim. Good luck, Wim. Good luck, Wim. Good luck. - Bye. - Good luck, Wim. Bye. Bye, Wim. Keep practicing and learning, Tibor. Welcome home, Wim. - For real? - Yes. Really. Just go. This is your room. Come on. Oh, a real train. And if you need anything, you just pull this cord. What do you wish? A meat ball would be nice. Please, sir. Mm, yummy! So, I'm going to school tomorrow? Of course, you can go to school tomorrow. Great. You love school, huh? I love dictations and geography, but especially fractions. Then you will go to master Sipke and have a good time. So, I'm going to school. Where is it? Here's your school. And where is the master? - Good day. - Wim, this is master Sipke. Hi, sir. So, Wim, have you ever been to school? Certainly. But, where are the other kids? You are the children, Wim. You're the class. You're the school. Am I being taught here alone? Yes, that is the best way. Just sit back. Master Sipke is going to teach you a lot. Good luck. Look, Wim. In early day of mankind, man looked in the sky... and saw perhaps a thousand stars. And if there were clouds, he saw no flute. May I continue? Then he invented the telescope... and saw maybe 10,000 stars. Then he invented the giant telescope... and then he saw 100,000 stars. When he dug into the ground... all he found was pebbles. As he dug deeper and deeper and he then found... coal. - So? - Oil... iron... copper, gold, sodium, chlorine, helium, hydrogen. Thus, he understood that the universe... consisted of different substances and compounds... with which he could do unbelievably many things. For example, man can make light and fire. He can float on water, or fly through the air. He can make steam out of water. He can bake clay. He can paint. He can make glass out of sand. The possibilities are endless. Do you understand it already, Wim? No, sir. And I really don't understand those atoms and molecules things. That's why you are in school. I'll explain it all. Maybe, I'll understand it when I'm 100. Are we going to do something fun? Happy hooping. Hey. How do you like it here? It's great... ma'am. If you want to... you can call me mama. The teacher is very pleased with you, Wim. Because you have done your best, we may go have some fun this afternoon. Where would you like to go? To the zoo. Where the monkey is. - Monkey? - Yes. My own monkey. He might miss me. Joris was also very fond of the zoo. - Are you holding on tight? - Good day, Wim. Nice, huh? - Kneel. - Well done. Do you want to ride the camel? No, I want to see the monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey, it's me, Wim. Oh, look at that. He has already made friends with the other monkeys. Do you remember... that we lived at Jet and Gijs? I wish I had given you a name. Then, I could call you. Fritz. Fritz! Well, Wim. What do you feel like doing today? Writing. What do you want to write? A letter. Dear Madam, You are very kind... and your husband, too. You have a beautiful house... and your servants are good at hooping. Although they are very boring. Yeah. I also learn a lot from Master Sipke. But, I miss the animals. I miss Jet... and Gijs. Even though he had the bees sting me, I still miss him. And Ot and Sien and school. I want to go to them. This is a mistake. Look, Wim. You're here to see if you like it. And we hope you like it here. I think that I like it here, but, it's so empty and quiet. And I want to live with Jet. Yes, but, Wim... if you want to leave here, - you have to go back to the orphanage. - No. Never ever. I'm not going back. Then we have a problem. I want to live with Jet. She needs me to help with the lambs and calves. It is very busy on the farm. Jet said she needed me. I can only take you to the orphanage. Those are the rules. I won't go! If you yell again, I will punish you. Oh, yeah? Then do it. To you, kids are like animals. If they do not do what you want then just lock them up. Oh, no, no, no, Wim. We would never do that. We would never lock you up. All we want is that you feel comfortable with us. Then we can sign this adoption paper so that you can become our son. I'd rather be outside with the animals. I understand that. Just go. I can milk you. Here, take a nice one. Thank you. Come on. Up. - Bye. - Bye. Very good. What are you going to call them? That's because they have become so round. - No. - They are so round. ♪ From your race, race, race ♪ ♪ The king drives through the puddle ♪ ♪ From you on, on, on ♪ ♪ The king drives through the gate ♪ ♪ From your greeting, greeting, greeting ♪ ♪ The king drives through the church ♪ ♪ From you one, two, three, Hatsjie ♪ ♪ Get two buckets of water ♪ ♪ Pump two buckets of water ♪ ♪ The girls on their clogs ♪ ♪ The boys on their wooden legs ♪ ♪ Drive through my street ♪ - Good day, Wim. - Good day, Jet. Form for adoption. What is this for? Here is where I belong. Mom, Mom, come look. Wim is back. You stay here a minute. What do we do with this? We can't just pluck him from the street. - But, he has no one but us. - Jet. - Even then, we can't take him in. - Why not? You're a schoolmaster, aren't you? If it can not be us-- That boy has twice come all this way here to go to school. He just deserves a chance. And in summer, he can help with the chores. He can't even milk. It looks like you're wrong, Gijs. I don't milk them completely empty. Then they have some for the calves. Ho. Ho! It's Wim. So. What a pity! Well, we can't make it official then. One moment. No, Tibor, that's my fountain pen. That's a very expensive accessory. - Well, give it back. - No. Let's see if it works. Ti... bor. It does work. Jet, you have a little brother. Well, it was a nuisance after all. I'm glad to get rid of it. Well, ma'am. You will be losing even more children. From the first of September, all these children must go to school. And I will make sure that they end up with loving parents. Maybe... I can help you. - Delphine, step aside. - No. - Get out the way. - Go away! Oh, oh. Aafje, next week, you'll be 11. And how old am I then? Wim, how old am I? You know what, ma'am? I'll take them right now.

But after the summer, I want to see them every morning at school. - Sure. - Agreed? - Thank you, Jan. - I will teach you to milk cows. Good day. - Bye. - Just go. But, Wim is not the only new student. We have many more new ones. A new class and a new teacher. Hello, everyone. Hello, Miss. Hey... I think I know you. And I know you. Find yourself a nice seat. There. Yes, nice, by the window. Have a seat. Are you coming with me? Then I can always look outside. Fritz! Yeah! It's open. Come take a look. It's open. Come and see. Hi. One more time.
