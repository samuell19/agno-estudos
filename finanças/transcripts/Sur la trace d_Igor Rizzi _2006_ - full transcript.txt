ON THE TRAIL OF IGOR RIZZI By the time I quit competition, I'd saved quite a nice little bundle. The team president introduced me to his finance banker, who'd tripled the fortunes of major sports stars. So I jumped in and lost everything. Everything. I was ruined. l calculate I spent 12 years chasing a soccer ball for nothing. I met M?lanie when the team doctor hired her as an assistant. She was 23, blonde, blue eyes. She emanated innocence. She was splendid. At first, I was like a kid. I barely spoke to her. I'd hide in the locker room and just watch her from a distance. - Where are your parents? - At the restaurant. A week later, we played Ajax in the European quarter-finals. We were losing 1-0, a minute before the end. The ball came to me. I was 10m from the goal. The crowd went crazy. I took the shot and the keeper took me out. I was KO. My left cheek was gashed open, bleeding, and M?lanie took care of me on the field. The second I smelled the scent of her skin, I wanted lo kiss her. I wanted to spend my life with her, with this girl. Hungry? Yeah. What do you think? - Five hundred. - OK. And the stuff downstairs? We'll see later. - Shit, my wallet. - Go check the car. What are you doing here? - Get out. - Got change for a coffee? No, nothing. Go on! It's not in the car. What if I forgot it over there? It got serious almost right away - nothing like my usual affairs. We took a fiat up in Monaco. We were really comfortable. The problem was my obsession that she stop working. Seeing her attend teammates drove me mad with jealousy. My harping made her quit, although she loved her job. I was a real jerk. She was fresh and un calculating. AH I did was hurt her. Pass me that thing. It had $800 in it. - Eight hundred bucks... - Yeah, that sucks. Want to play? - I got it! - What? Found it. My wallet. Hey, you can 't do that. - I got a job for you. - Oh, yeah ? It'll pay big money. What is it? I first made love with M?lanie at the Sheraton in Kiev. I'd been trying to get her for two months. I was with a model at the time. A Danish redhead. What's her name... She was always hanging off me. I didn't know how to get rid of her. Hold our center, Campanez; she was crazy about him. He came on to her. She succumbed. I left her, and devoted myself to M?lanie. Yeah ? You again... I'm not interested. I don 't need your job. Thai guy calls me weekly to train a team of guys released from jail. For free! For the fun of keeping smart-assed delinquents busy. Like We nothing else to do. I had nothing against marriage. I just wasn't in a rush. My career was hectic. I told her we'd have time to marry afterwards. Things were so easy. I put everything off. It got out-of-hand. I was totally indecisive. I was rich, famous. I had present, future, everything, under control. In the end, I would never see her in her wedding dress. Never. At the time, I was quite smug. I thought handled my feelings well, not like those idiots who plunge in, head first. I controlled my emotions. When Hooked a! M?lanie, I'd think, "You're so beautiful. That dress is nice on you. I love the way you walk, how you touch my face." But I held back. I wouldn't compliment her. I never showed her how I felt. I kept it all in side, and it will stay there forever. - lt's not far by subway. - No, I'd rather walk. I didn't give your real name. I said it was Astor. - Why "Astor"? - I don't know. I like it. There's a billionaire named Astor. It's there. No one's here. You're sure this is it? Sure, I'm sure. We'll wait a bit. - Want some? - What's in it? I don 't know. Raisins. No, I don 't like that. That's it, I'm leaving. Five more minutes. Hello. L'll let you get on with it. - Astor, right? - Yes. - L'm Howard. - Howard. OK. I have a dirty Russian-ltalian to liquidate. l'll give you $15,000. - $15,000. - Yeah, $7,000 u p front, the rest once the job is done. - I gotta kill someone. - Yeah. - Well, I'll have to think about it. - What do you mean? I'm not sure. I gotta think it over. You there! Who's this? He says he needs to think. Oh, yeah? Tell me when you make up your mind. - What did you tell him? - That I needed to think. One day, the media showed up at my hotel to ask how I felt. How I felt... about what? That's how I found out she was dead: watching TV. They knew every detail of her death, everything. There I was, staring off in to space, and I thought, "They must mean someone else, not M?lanie. 'This has nothing to do with me." Bu! It did have to with me, and me alone. Are you OK? Are you OK? After, the shock was so terrible, I felt lost and lonely everywhere. I had two choices: shoot myself, or move here, where Melanie was born and grew up, where perhaps I'd fee! her presence. Montr?al, Qu?bec, the snow. This was the best way to get close to her. I could have gone to the police. And said what? "?A woman died in my house. I had nothing to do with it. "?I ran after the guy, but he getaway." No, bad idea. The best thing is not to get in valved. Seven grand. Count it. OK, good. - Do it before Tuesday, the 28th. - Before the 28th. No mistakes. Focus, and don 't miss. Get it? I'll try. The problem is, I don 't know how to shoot. - You don 't? - No, I've never done it. Get him a gun and teach him. I'm counting on you. Make sure you get within 5 meters. Isnn't 5 meters a bit... - OK, gimme the cash. - No, it's fine! I can pull this off. - Been here long? - Ten minutes. - I h ave stuff for you. - Yeah ? It's heavy. Where'd you get this? - The bullets? - Yes. You shoot. It's your connection. Why don 't you do it? I shot a guy once... right here. This is everything you need to know: address, what he looks like, his day job, his oar. This guy? His name's Igor Rizzi. Igor Rizzi... Doesn't look like a bad guy. - Why kill him? What did he do? - No idea. We don 't care. Who was it you killed? First, you gotta decide if you're aiming for the head... or the chest. - Head or ch est, OK. - Waffling between the two is bad. Shooting someone is about breathing. So you aim, hold your breath so it doesn't shake, shoot, an d release. Go ahead. Alright. - What happens if I miss? - I don't know... Just make sure you don't. Killing a man, that takes guts. Igor Rizzi walked this earth for a while, did good and bad, and I, Jean-Marc Thomas, ex-soccer player, will put an end to his days for money. Igor Rizzi's life versus my rent, my food and my electricity bill. Wait! I can 't keep up. I gotta tell you, the 15,000 is off the table. Why? Howard can 't cough up more than 7,000. Really? That's how this business goes. Are you still in? Yeah, fine. 7,000 in the hand... Lt Gilbert MacCoy. I'm investigating the disappearance of a young woman. - Someone from around here? - No, she lived further north. - Her husband called it in. - How long ago? She was last seen on this street Wednesday night. Wednesday night. Notice anything that night? I was here Wednesday night, but no. No strange noises, screams, anything like that? No, nothing. She was wearing a brown coat with fur trim. No, I didn't see anything. If I had, I'd tell you. Yes, of course. Is that all? That's it. M?lanie, tell me you 're not angry with me. I have news. Can I come in? There's a witness who says he saw a woman running away from a man in a red coat... Wednesday night. She hid in a house around here. Your house, in fact. My house. Unbelievable, eh? He says she was pretty beat up. She was pretty badly beat up. Was she dead or alive when she left? The great thing is, Mr Thomas, the police always win. Where are all my fans and admirers now? Al! they did was ruin my life. They made me get I! all mixed up: soccer, the fan s, money, love, it was all the same. When M?lanie and I argued, I said she was lucky to be with me. When I add it all up, I think destiny took her to punish me. Fate decided to punish me. What you're doing isn't very nice. Give me that. Get up. Get in. Now, then... tell me where the body is and l'll forget what I just saw. OK, let's go. - Damn, I'm going west. - What? - I took westbound instead of east. - What are you up to? Nothing, I'll turn around. I made a mistake. Keep going. I think it's there. Go see. Yeah, it's h ere. OK, go back. Open the bag. Open it! Move away so I can see. Get back! H! never know if it was a boy or a girl. "Not now. I don 't fee! ready." That's what I told M?lanie when she said she was pregnant. "Not ready." The worst thing I ever said. Now, I know what it means. It means Pm not a father. I will never hold in my arms the little child with Melanie's smile. The train came. I didn't get on, and the next one never came. M?lanie, tel! me you don'! hold it against me. I should've done so many things differently. Look at life. If I see you're happy and doing good things, I'm happy too. Hello. - Are you Mr Thomas? - Yes. You 're the own er of a 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass, license 756 YSL? Yes. Your car was crash ed on the Trans-Canada near Ste-H?l?ne-de-Bagot. What? A man was found dead inside, one Gilbert Garnier. Did you know him? He was armed. He was a known criminal. He had a prison record. - What do I do? - Identify the car and file a report. I'll take care of it. You 'll be called in to investigate if you had ties to Gilbert Garnier. Sure, it's only normal. Here's the insurance form and the address where your car is. - Voila. Good day, sir. - Good day. Life is strange. I didn't have to hunt down MacCoy and hand him over to police. Fate decided to punish him. Fate. I wonder wha't that really means. Hi, how are you? What's with you ? I'm quitting this. What? I don 't want to do these things anymore. What will you do about Igor Rizzi? Nothing. I won't kill him. Wait, you can 't do that! Give back the $7,000 for me. - The gun? - Yeah... - And the cartridges? - Damn, I forgot them. This guy's not joking around. You agreed. You gotta come through. Sorry. That's how it goes. You can't dump me! If it's not done by Tuesday, it'll end badly for both of us! L'm not killing him. I'll go talk to Howard, but I won't kill him. I'll kill him myself. - Don't do it, Michel! - I have to. We can 't back-track. Listen to me. You can do better than this too. Just quit it all. Michel will kill Igor Rizzi. Life is just connections. By correcting my mistake, I've created another. I'm not responsible for Michel, or for his choices. But if I don't stop him, I too will be responsible for Rizzi's death. "Mr Rizzi, I can'! tel! you who I am, so I'll get to the point. Someone will try to kill you in the coming hours. If you go to the police, you 'll have to explain your past, which I doubt is spotless. ll you wall for the killer, you'll have lo kill him or he'll kill you. There's only one solution: go as far away as possible. M?lanie will have a good image of me now. lf my actions will make her happy, I'll do all the good l can. M?lanie left with half our love. I'll take care of the other half.
