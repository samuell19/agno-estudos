[light piano music] [birds chirping] Hello? [stumbling] Oh! Oh. Is, um, is Leo Kaplan here? Oh, oh. [chuckles] Sorry. I think I'm in the wrong house. Rosemary?! Oh, my God! Hi! Emma! Wow, you look so different. It's Bliss. Come on. I'll show you inside. [man humming] Great. [mystic chant] Is, um, is Leo here? He's working but I'll show you to his room. [Rosemary] Oh, good. Thank you so much, Emma. Bliss. -Sat Nam. Oh! -This is my boyfriend, Shamrock. Rosemary went to high school with me and Leo. It's, um, nice to meet you. [chuckles] We've met before. Oh, no. I just moved here actually, it's-- We've met before. -[Rosemary chuckles nervously] [man humming in the distance] I have to go to the bathroom. [sighs] [man clucking] [chuckling] Jesus.

It's what I signed up for, so. What is it you do? I'm in pharmaceuticals. Oh, so you're a pharmacist. It's kind of hard to explain. -So, you're not a pharmacist. Well, I don't know, when you think about it I'm not that different from a pharmacist. You sound like a drug dealer. -No. Well, yeah, kinda. Um, no. I, uh, I work at the Vitamin Shop. Can I ask you something? Of course. Why are you wearing a suit? -[laughs] I am working a Bar Mitzvah tonight. You're handing out echinacea to 13 year-olds? No. -[laughs] I'm actually the most requested Bar Mitzvah emcee on the west side. Seriously? [laughs] -True story. You should come with me. To the Bar Mitzvah? -Yeah. No, I mean, really? [woman chanting] [all chanting] Yeah. -Is... is that? [light rock music] [revving] [crowd chattering] Oh, my God, wow. Yeah. [girl] Oh, my God, look at her dress! [laughing] Explain to me why you're wearing that dress again. -It's vintage! Where's the bathroom? -It's over there. Hey, will you sneak some drinks on your way back? -Sure. Oh, and if anyone asks, just tell them you're with the DJ. You've been waiting to say that, haven't you? Yes, I have. [slapping] -Ooh! [toilet flushing] [door opening] Oh, sorry. Excuse me. -We were late, so. Oh. That's a cute dress. I feel like my sister wore the same exact one to her eight grade dance. [chuckles] It is vintage but I kind of doubt it. Uh.

Oh, I came on a cloud. So, we all come from places. I'm with the D.J.! [boy] Want to dance? -Is that the D.J.? You know what? It's okay. She's with me. She's legal. Barely. -Ew. I didn't need you to do that. I just saved you from a night of awkward teen romance. Generally, people say thank you. Oh, um... Thank you. Look, hold on, hold on. Whoa, whoa. Hold on, so, you're not going to tell me how we met? I was sketching you this morning? Where, in my bed? You wish. -[chuckles] Were you stalking me? -May's Cakery? Oh, you're serious. -Mm-hmm. Mm. You were a little busy. -Mm. So, you can be honest. Did you just crash this thing just so you could meet me? [imitates] You can be honest. Did you just crash this thing so you can pick up underage girls? -Do I talk like that? I've lost my wife. Have you seen her? I have not. Now, Donald, this is-- -Hi, I'm Rosemary. Hi, nice to meet you. I like the pink hair. Thank you. I'm a natural pinkhead. -Really? Don't you dare ask if the carpet matches the drapes. Oh, you're sassy. Hey, she's sassy. I can see that. Your wife might agree. So seriously, what are you two assholes doing here? [Tom] No, no. He's the only asshole here. What? -No, no, we grew up with Rebecca. That-- your dance partner's mom. Please, let's not make a big deal out of it. -[all chattering] Hey, I've been texting you. Can I have your jacket, please? Hey, uh, yeah. -Thank you. Oh, babe. This is, um... Hi, I'm May. -Rosemary.

[May] Mm... She's a little bit of a strange choice for Tom, don't you think? [Donald] Seems kind of spunky. Spunky? Oh, you cannot wait for him to call you tomorrow and tell you about the blow jobs that he's getting tonight. Blow jobs? Like, plural? [laughs] No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Look, I have the greatest wife in the world. If you think you'd be happier getting blow jobs from random girls then... This is not about blow jobs. Nobody's getting any blow jobs. Certainly not after this. You're attracted to her. I'm married. I think... -I'm not going to tell you what to do. -...we should go to my place. Oh. Do you, now? Madame. -Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on. [laughing] Madame, your chariot awaits. Mm-mm. What is that? A present. What did you do? Why do you always expect the worst? I don't. It's a thermometer. So we'll know when we're ovulating. Plus, you can sync it to your phone. Sync it to your own phone. Hey, the whole point of moving here was so we could start trying. -[sighs] Aw, come on. I don't want to use that thing. Let's just let it happen naturally, and if it happens, it happens. Okay? You know, you are actually kind of hot when you don't try so hard. Actually, kind of? Mm-hmm. Hey. Try not to fall in love with me. [groovy rock music] [moaning] [sports playing on the tv] [loud moans] [breathing heavily] Fuck! Yes! Yes. That was awesome. Oh! [exhaling] Oh, that was... That was incredible. -[loudly sighs] I really need to go to more Bar Mitzvahs. [laughing] Just doing my part for the Jewish community. [chuckles] Can I? Huh. You know... I thought this place was going to be much douche-ier but it's kind of nice. [laughing] Uh, thanks? Mm-hmm. Um, I'm, uh... I'm going to go. Oh. I guess you're going to miss my pancakes. Seriously? Save the pancake mix for another girl. That's fucked up. I'd never use a mix. [laughing] What's your name, anyway? [grumpily laughs] You don't know my name? [chuckles] [chuckling] Goodbye. Goodbye. [gentle music] Hey, I can't do this anymore. Come on, slowpoke. Ah! I have a, I have a crick in my neck from your stupid couch. What? I have the most comfortable couch on the planet. No, you don't. Seriously, why don't you have a bed like a normal person? -Yuck. Well, my last girlfriend helped me go couch shopping when I moved into my old place. -Uh-huh. And every one I liked she kept telling me I couldn't afford. So, finally I was like, "It's not your money or your couch, so stop telling me what I can't afford." And she goes, "Um, well, when we get married, I'm going to have a say in what we can and can't afford." And I was like, "What? Married?" And then we got into this huge fight right in the middle of Living Spaces. What happened to her? I dumped her. She was saying the M-word like two months after we started dating. Plus I knew she wasn't the one 'cause every time we had sex I'd hear this little voice in my head saying, "This is not your wife. This is not your wife. It's someone else's wife." It was creepy. [lighter clicking] What are you doing? It's California, weirdo. So, you came home really late last night. And? I don't know, I'm just saying. That was fast. Yeah, that was kind of the point. You got to sleep with them as quickly as possible before they do something that completely ruins it and you're not attracted to them anymore. Good plan. God, I wish I was a girl. [light music] Hi. Uh, I'm here to see Jack Feldman. Great. You going to tell him I'm here? Do you want me to? You know they arrived damaged? This is the second time this has happened. [over the phone] Really? -Yes, really. I'm sorry. -Are you? Okay, you know something? I can't talk about this right now. I have somebody here. But I'm going to talk to you later today. [Jack] Ok. So, did you bring a resume? Oh, uh. Well, I, uh, I actually brought you some sketches and, um, some photographs of, uh, of my paintings. So... [chuckles] We haven't even hired you and you're hitting me up for favors? [stammers] Okay, so I've been working on this series, right? Where, um, I take something really small and I blow it up into these, like, large scale, um-- Well, to be honest by the time it gets that big it's hard to tell what it is anymore. Okay. Look, as long as you can keep it straight that when you're here, you're working for me and you're taking care of my artists first. Oh, and I need you on weekends. Especially when we get close to the show. What, you have a problem with that? You don't remember me. We actually met. In Brooklyn. At my show. You told me to call you. What, you just showed up? Sorry. -No. No, I like that. Oh. Great. Do you want the job or what? [light music] If you're reconsidering my pancakes I only make them at home. [both laughing] What? Sorry, what? I can't even talk. You seem tongue tied. What are you doing here? -What are you doing here? What am I-- -Are you following me? I'm not following you. I'm going to work. I was going-- You work here? -Well, I did follow you actually. I was checking you out. I do, yeah. It's my gallery. It's your gallery? -It's my gallery. Really? -Yup, really. So, I guess you know that I work here. Yeah, right here. -For these right here? Uh huh. -Oh, good. Oh, good, you're here. I see you've met Tom. Tom, yeah. We just met outside. -Huh. This is Annabelle. -I'm Annabelle. Nice to meet you. Again. Oh, I thought you looked familiar. I met you at that rave with Starfish, right? Rave, huh? You must be pretty young. Younger than you. And I don't go to raves. Then how do you know Starfish? What about Bar Mitzvahs? Do you go to those? Come with me, Pinky. I need your artistic opinion. So, uh, Brooklyn, right? Oh, yeah. -Yeah, yeah, it's coming back to me. -It's back? No, it's coming back. -Oh. Um, I didn't... I didn't have the pink hair. Okay. So, what's going on with you and Tom? Do you know him? [nervous laugh] Uh, why? I don't know, just wondering. Okay. Well... bring those paintings out here. Let's take a look at them. -Okay. Come on. -Thank you. I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but you might want to consider hanging some paintings on the wall. Clearly you're not versed in the art of reductive design. You always this full of shit? Pretty much. Yeah. -[chuckles] So, uh, are you going to tell me why you're here or am I supposed to guess? Jack saw my paintings in Brooklyn. You really are an artist. -A painter. Please don't-- -[makes playful noise] Wow. These are actually kind of good. No, seriously. I'd, uh, I'd love to see more. I don't show my work to people who've been inside me. [chuckles] Good policy. See you later. [phone ringing] [chewing noise] Jesus Christ! [Tom] I'm sorry, did I-- -Get the fuck out of here, sexual harassment Ghandi. I don't want that. Get out of here! [Tom] Um, are you talking to me? No, sorry. Ugh. Who is this? It's Tom. From the gallery. Oh. [chuckles] Hi. So, look, I'm sorry to call you so late. And it's not what you think, so before you answer, just know that I've called five other girls and no one's around-- So, I'm number six? -Um... A strong six,[laughs] yeah. Uh huh. -Look, I was wondering if you could come over, um, because-- Wow. [chuckles] -No, no, no, no, no. It's not like that. I just, I have a, a concussion, and I'm not supposed to go to sleep. Uh-huh. -Look, I do actually need someone to keep me awake. So, if there's any way you could do it, I would really, I would really appreciate it. [chuckles] You better have a concussion. [Rosemary laughs] So then, I'm in the bathroom. Are you listening? -Mm-hmm. And he's like, he's like making these dolphin noises, and apparently, like, this is a huge turn on for these girls. It's like, panties dropping left and right, and Emma's apparently okay with it because they're polyamorous. Of course. I didn't realize that dolphins were polyamorous. No, not the dolphins. The people. Oh, oh, right. -Duh. [laughs] Well, it is Venice. Yeah. I just miss New York. [grumps] -No, no, no. No getting up. -Oh, come on. You're a very bad patient. -Am I, really? Yeah, you are. -Am I? Don't-- Hey, I'm serious. [chuckles] [lips smacking] -I am serious. If we do that... -What? ...you will fall asleep right after. What if I fall asleep during? [soft laugh] That's happened to me, you know? No. -I swear. We'd, like, smoked a bunch of pot, and he was going down on me, and it was getting, like, softer and slower, which was sort of, it was kind of nice, actually. And then, [chuckles] all of a sudden, it stops. And I looked down and he was just, like, asleep on my inner thigh. -No, you're kidding. I swear to God. What did you do? I, like, nudged him. [laughs] -[laughs] And then, he, like, picks right back up, right where he left off. Wow. Good for him. And then we was like, snoring about two minutes later. I assume you left. No, I just, uh, brought coffee every time I hung out with him. You're a lady with a plan, aren't you? [chuckles] [laughing] -Okay. Now you go. Oh, what do you mean? It's your turn. What is this, like a game? No, it's just a way to keep you awake. No, no, no. I don't like this. Too bad. What am I supposed to, to tell you sexual stories? No, just something honest. Honest? -Mm-hmm. Oh, fuck. Okay. [grunts] Okay. You want honest? Mm-hmm. -Okay. I'll give you honest. Um... I... kissed my friend's wife once. Wow. Before she was his wife. It was New Year's Eve and we'd been drinking all day, and he passed out way before midnight. And the next thing you know the countdown was happening, and she was looking at me or, uh, it was a weird vibe, you know. But I wasn't sure if it was real or if I was just imagining it, you know? Mm-hmm. And then, um... the ball dropped. And... she kissed me, and, uh... and I kind of kissed her back. Did you like it? Oh, my God. You're fucking killing me. [chuckles] Did you? -No, no. I mean, yeah. I guess on some level I must have, right? I mean, in, in a completely fucked up way. I just wish I never did it. Hey. We all kiss the wrong person once in a while. [phone alarm] Mm. -[laughing] You did it. I'm still awake. Mm. -Success. I like talking to you.

No, we're-- I already told him. -Where you going? We can't, we can't go. -Where you going? A bunch of us are going up to, um, this retreat up north.

You're not-- look, I'm serious, these guys are waiting for us. [Rosemary] Aw. Where are we even going again? I've never even heard of this place. Seriously, Ro. You got to get dressed. I'm not doing this. [laughing] -I'm not doing this. I'm not falling for it. -You're not? Are you sure? I think you're going to do it. -No, those guys-- Oh, my God, okay. This is not... fair. Mm. Okay, alright, you're right, fine. I'll go get dressed. -No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. I don't want to thwart your, your impulses. That would be... -Oh. ...bad for your art. -Mm-hmm.

I'm bummed we didn't have time to take the tour. I told you we should come earlier. No, that's okay. I mean, there's nothing really to see. Everything's still in boxes. -Oh, Don't listen to her, May's amazing. She should've been an interior designer. [Rosemary] Really? -Yeah, it's gorgeous. So, Rosemary, Tom tells us that you're an artist. A painter. -Oh. Artist is like calling yourself a genius or something. Don't take it personally, she's very shy... with her work. -[laughs] Come on. -Oh, right. I'm sure that you have been wonderful in opening her up. -[Tom] Okay. Tom is very generous with all of his painters. Oh, yeah? All 147 of them? I found his list. Oh, you saw it? -I do not keep a list. Alright, you're right. It was a spreadsheet. No. -[all laughing] Is it color coded? I always appreciate when its color coded so I keep everything straight. -Donald. I don't mean in a racist way. [crickets chirping] [light music] This is nice.

I really thought I had this one in the bag. Oh, my God. Do you mean you dragged us all up here based on a couple of emojis, by the way, so you could sleep with this girl, and she's not even coming? Oh. Well, no, she texted me that she had a family emergency followed by one of those crying emojis. You know that one? So. Crying emoji, must be serious. Yeah, so I can't really be mad at her. Whatever, dude. This place better be awesome. Oh. It is. [Tom] Oh, here they are. She is gorgeous. [grunts] -Oh. Okay, you don't have to grunt. I mean, just-- -Did I grunt? It was involuntary. -You were taking mental pictures. Hey, stop. -[grunts] [Tom] Jesus. [Donald laughs] -Stop. Stop? -Oh. Oh! I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry, You, like, "like her" like her. She's, she's fun to hang out with. Yeah, she's, you know. Is she living with you? -No, no. I mean, she's, you know, she's staying with me, but-- Oh, right. Just, like, six or seven days a week. That's cool. -May likes her. Really? She say something? No, I can tell. What's her deal? She's new to town. She's working at the gallery, helping us out with the show. New to town. I love it. Oh, oh, helping "us" out? How is she helping "us" out? -She's doing office work for us. Oh, like, back office work? Are you serious? -I hope so. God, I hope so. -Please, stop. Are you gonna put her in the show? -No. Why not? -I don't want to complicate things. Holy shit! You do like this chick. Well, I don't mix work with relationships. [laughing] Um, that's all you do. No, I get it. No, no, it's cool, I get it. Things are different because you're finally in love! [Donald] I'm in love! -Would you stop? What are you, twelve? I am so tired, it looks so good. -Yeah, it does. The last few months has been-- Oh. Uh. [chuckles] I don't think you can wear that in the tub. [chuckles] -No, seriously. They're, like, actually like adamant about it. Well, what are we supposed to wear? Okay. I guess we're going to be wearing the same outfit. Oh! There they are. -[Donald] Hey! [Rosemary chuckles] What are you two creeps doing up there? Oh, just-- -Talking about relationships, life. Observing nature. You know. -You know. Seriously. Ding-dong and Applesauce enjoying nature. [Tom] I like that Leo took us to a family friendly place. [all laughing] -[Rosemary] Totally. [Tom] It feels so family. Oh, my gosh, honey. Isn't this awesome? -[May] Yeah. [Tom] Is it hot? [Donald] Yes! Are we really getting? Okay. -We really are. I am. Boom! -[Rosemary laughs] [Donald] Woo, yes! [Tom] Okay, making an egg! [Rosemary] Oh, my God. It's so many dicks, and it's so early. Okay, yeah. -Good to know. We should get a pool in the house. Let's put one in. Yeah. -[groans] She's worried about the kids we don't have yet drowning. [May] Donald. -Oh. We're trying. -[Rosemary] Really? Well, we'll see. Wait, aren't you guys worried about all the porn? Like, your kid-- no, seriously, isn't there like a lot of porn shot in Van Nuys? -Oh, Jesus. That kitchen looked familiar. -I hate that kitchen. We're gonna re-do the kitchen. -Yeah, eventually. 'Cause May's a baker. -Oh, yeah? A serious baker. -Really? I actually used to own a bakery right down the street from Tom's gallery. Oh, cool. -But we had to sell it so we could live in the valley. [Rosemary chuckles] Oh. Are you-- Wait a minute, are you the-- Is she theMay? She's theMay. That is her. -Amazing. Oh, my God, shut up! Seriously, your cupcakes are like my crack! [Leo] Whose cupcakes? -[laughs] Oh! Nobody's-- Oh! -Nobody's! [laughs] -[Rosemary] Sorry, guys, this is my friend Leo. [Leo] Incoming! -[May] Oh, okay. [splashing] -[Leo] What's up? [Tom] Everybody get to know each other. [laughs] Like, God. Alright. -[Rosemary chuckles] This is how orgies start, isn't it? Not even a little bit. How many people do you need for an orgy? Here we go. -[Tom] That's a fair question. Thank you. -Orgy math is tricky. I think the technical requirement is to have enough people so you can't tell who you're touching. -Don't listen to him. He's never even had a threesome. -I've tried it! Really? When? You've slept with, like, two people. No. I've slept with seven people, if you count blowjobs and cunnilingus. [laughing] -Cunnilingus? Whatever, dude. Threesomes are lame. [laughing] Fuck. [Donald chuckling] -What? Nothing, nothing. We're talking about threesomes with two girls, right? [crickets chirping] [Rosemary] You tired, old man? [laughing] Leo is, um... interesting. -Yeah. Uh-huh. -Yeah, I feel bad about the... what was her name? Honeybee? -Yeah. [laughs] Don't worry about it. That wasn't going to happen. Even if she came here, he wouldn't have, uh, closed the deal. Hmm. No? -No. [Tom] What was Donald doing tonight? Was he grabbing you? -[Rosemary laughing] [Rosemary] What? -[Tom] Oh, boy. [both laughing] -[Tom] I think he was doing it in his mind. [Rosemary] Oh, really? -[Tom] Yeah. [Rosemary] Is that true? Did you have fun with them? -Mm-hmm. [both chuckling] I feel like it's an octopus. -[making monster sounds] [laughing] [light clicks] [woman] And, deep breath in, bring your arms up. And look at the sky. Let's sway like the trees. Just like how the trees do, and you can close your eyes. Mm, do you feel that breeze? Thank you, breeze. Now, let's twinkle our fingers. And you can let your twinkle fingers go wherever they want to go. [Donald] Oh, sorry. [Donald laughs] That feels good. -They're not twinkling. You're not twinkling. -You're really good, guys. There's no twinkle. Ooh. Where are they going? -[sighs] [all laughing] [Leo] So, it's my first day at this new school and I'm scared shitless. And all the other kids are, like, ignoring me, right? So, one day at lunch I hear a bunch of them talking about how much they love Billy Joel. I can't believe you're telling this story. And so, I go home and I stay up half the night making this Billy Joel mix. And I'm, like, super proud of this thing. And so, the next day, I march onto the playground, boombox in hand, you know, just blasting "The Piano Man"... [laughing] -...thinking these guys are going to think I am awesome. And then all of a sudden, Bobby Bosco gets up in my face, and he turns off the music, and he's like, "what is this?" And I'm like, "it's a Billy Joel Mix!" And he's like, "Billy Joel? Billy Joel was a fucking faggot, man. We like Billy Joe. From Green Day." -Oh, no! Then he starts laughing and then all these other kids join in. And it's just fucking brutal. And I feel like I'm about ready to cry or something. [sighing] And then, all of a sudden... the music comes back on. And everyone stops. And there's this one. [laughing] I mean, the smallest human being I've ever seen in my life. [all laughing] Just, like, belting it out. And it was... I mean, it was, like, one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me. I just really liked the song. -[May laughing] Well, you should have seen Tom in college. Okay. -You guys went to college together? No, no, Donald and I grew up together. I visited him in college a lot. Which I soon realized had nothing to do with me. [Donald] Oh, that's not-- -Yeah, He'd call me up and be like, "What are you up to this weekend?" And before I could even answer him, he'd be like, "Uh, is, uh, is May going to be there?" Okay, that is completely bull-- -[Tom] True, true! May didn't even know I existed. That's also true. Aw. -[Leo] I'm sorry, man. So anyway, when I moved out to L.A., Donald came out to visit me. When I was throwing Tom a birthday party at this Karaoke place. -[Leo] Nice! [May] Yeah. -Love that! [chuckles] Yeah, so, May signed us up to sing. By the time our number was called, I was actually in the bathroom. No, actually you were at the bar flirting with that redhead. [Donald] No, he was in the bathroom banging that redhead. Jesus! Really? -I really bet. [Donald] Yup. [Tom] Thank you. -You're welcome. [May] Well, wherever you were... -Inside her. ...I had to bring Donald up on stage with me instead. And I don't sing. -Nope, not even a little bit. [May] I mean, he just kind of moans. But. -But, no, no, no. That night, honestly, he was, he was, unbelievable. I mean, I literally, I left this poor girl in the bathroom stall. I did. I do. -Shut up! [Donald] I think she's still there today. -I should call her. No, so I could, I could go out and hear him. I mean, you were ridiculous. Ridiculous, yes. And... and the rest is history. [May] As they say. [Donald chuckles] Leo. -Mm? Slow down. [gargling] -No-- oh. [May laughs] -No way, man. I'm single and ready to mingle. Whoa! Hey, what's up, ladies? What are you trying to do, fuck a tree? Oh, yeah, ooh. I love fucking trees. [grunts] -[chuckling] Oh, my God. [Leo] Wow, you need some moisturizer. I got to be careful, I'll get a splinter in my dick. [laughing] [Rosemary chuckles] You're so insane. Are you okay? No, no, no. Please do not. Do not encourage Sad Leo. Oh, It's just like, "Where is she already, you know? It's just like, "Fuck!" [sighs] I mean, I don't mean to sound like a girl or anything, but it's just like, man, Sunday nights get lonely sometimes. Hey, you don't want that. Everybody's looking for their person. You don't really believe that, do you? I think everyone believes that, or they should. Don't you ever? [chuckles] Sorry, don't you ever just want to say, "Fuck it"? Like, do something that doesn't make sense, you know. Screw up your life, like, leave your husband. Whoa, okay. She's kidding. I don't think she is. I mean, I get it. Like, what if I didn't exist? Yes! -[May] But you do exist. [Donald] Okay, look, If I were on my own, I'd just-- I would sell our place and get the smallest, shittiest boat. You'd sell our place? -I would be a fish farmer! Oh, so now I'm stopping you from being a fish farmer? [Leo] That's amazing. There's no point to this conversation. Like, haven't you ever had a fantasy that he was dead? No! Dead? -Not like, "dead" dead. But just, like, gone. Yes, he drives me crazy a lot but at the end of the day, I'm... happy that I get to lay down next to him. Sounds really romantic. [chuckles] What? I-- no, I'm just, I'm just saying not everyone is like that. Okay. What about you, Tom? What about me? Are you like that? Are you looking for your soulmate? [Rosemary] Leo. Shut up. Why are youblushing? You're such a dick. [trumpet ringtone sounding] We're ovulating. [Rosemary] I sort of feel bad for him. I don't know, it's just so, like, heavy. You know what I mean? -What are you talking about? I don't know. They seem kind of miserable to me. Donald and May? -Yeah! No, they're great together. They're just, you know. They-- I don't know. I don't really even know them, but-- [yawns] Exactly. -[chuckles] [chuckling] You should shut up. [laughing] You're so rude. You want me to shut up? -No, I don't want you to shut up. Tell me what you think. -Hmm. I don't know. It's just like... I mean, can you picture the two of them having sex? [laughing] Are you serious right now? I'm totally serious. -Come on! I know you know what I'm talking about. -No, look. They're going through a bit of a rough patch right now, that's all. They are just... It's like, um, they're like an anti-marriage campaign. Look, things aren't always... -I'm sorry. ...smooth sailing-- -So you don't get in the boat? No, you, you get in the boat. You just got to make sure you're in with the right first mate, that's all. Mm-hmm. I have a question for you. Mm. -Are you a sailor? Because you'd make such a hot sailor. I think you are a sailor, aren't you? -You know what? You need to focus. You need to focus. -You're keeping secrets from me. You know what? Okay, I got it. I got it, it's like, it's like you're in the bunker. Oh, all right. -Right, and you-- So now we're in a war. [laughs] Would you let me finish? -We went from sailing... Would you let me finish? -...to warring? Please. -Fine, I'm not going to fight with you about this. I'm not fighting, I'm trying to explain something. -Alright, old man. Explain it. Okay, so... now I lost my train of thought. Okay, you know what? Forget about the two of them for a second. Just, I mean... like, you and I. I mean, we're... What? Lost. -You-- [chuckles] I wasn't going to say lost but-- -No, no, wait. I mean, seriously, how did we get-- Where are we? Hey. [sighs] What? What would you do if I weren't here? [groans] Are you really waking me up for this? I want to know. I'd sleep on both sides of the bed. That's it? -Mm-hmm. Come on. -[groaning] Come on. Please? Oh, gosh. [sighs] I would, um... I'd go out on the rooftop and sunbathe naked. And I would flirt a lot. With married men. And I'd go out on dates, just lots of dates and... think about all the ways that they weren't like you, and how I wish that they were like you, but then thank God for all the ways that they're not like you. [laughing] And I would buy all new bras and lingerie. And I would go out and I would just fuck somebody the way that I've never fucked you before. And I would travel, I would just go everywhere and get fat. And then I would go and get in the best shape of my life. And I would say what I mean more often, to everyone. I would be more excited to wake up in the morning. I just, I would just feel more alive. But then I would go to bed and I would miss you... the old you. I really miss the old you. This is how orgies start, isn't it? [waves crashing] [splashing] [Tom] Ro? Is that you? [eerie music] Hey. I know you're in there. [soft dramatic music] [Tom] No, they love-- Yeah, that's, that's the one they loved. That's what I said. Yeah. Um... Yeah. No, those were the exact-- those were the exact words that they used, yeah. No, they're very excited. I told them you had a whole series of similar, um, things that they could always, you know, take a... uh... um... Yeah, I'd say so. Okay, listen, I've got to go. I will, I will see you Thursday. Okay, alright, bye. Hey, what's up? I'm not doing this again with you. Doing what? -You and Pinkerbell are flitin' around here like it's your first date at sleep-away camp. It's not like that. -She just walked out here without a shirt. We're closed for the installation. Who cares? She doesn't know what's coming, does she? Poor girl. [sighs] -Are we sleeping? You are. Were. Good. I saw your painting today. What? What? No, it's not finished yet-- -Relax. I-- I think we should put it in the show. I want to. I think you should do a whole series for it. Why? Because it's really good. You're really good. Do you know that? I love you. So, what time does the Tom-i-nator get home? If you don't hold still we're going to be here all night. Stop sketching me! -Why? God, we're supposed to be hanging out. [paper crunches] Ouch. I just can't believe that you and Tommy-Mc-Wonderful-- Okay, You know what? If you don't stop it with the nicknames I'm going to think you're in love with him. Should we order some food? Rosemary? Rosemary? -Huh? What? I said, should we order some food? Oh, sorry. I just-- I keep thinking I should go to the gallery and check the layout again. -Oh, God, you are obsessed. [phone vibrating] Do you know how hard it is to get into a gallery? And this is a good one. -No. Well, it's really hard. Well then I guess it's a good thing you're with him. [phone vibrating] Is it weird? What? Living with someone? No. Why? -I don't know. I just figured you would've bailed by now. What's that supposed to mean? Hey, I'm exactly the same way. I don't bail. I just-- I go, wherever... I go wherever I'm happy. I'm happy here. [Rosemary] Hey. -Hey. You're home so early. Yeah, just uh... [Rosemary] What are you doing? Are you going to come up? Yeah, yeah. In a minute. Um... Was Leo here? -[Rosemary] Yeah. I texted you five times. [Rosemary] What? -Nothing, just... [Rosemary] I can't hear, can you come up here? Yeah. Yup, coming. Hey. Hey. So, what were you guys doing? Oh, we went for a hike and then he sat for me. He sat for you, did he? Yeah. What? -Don't you think that's-- I don't know, just, don't you think it's a little-- I mean, the guy's here all the time. I mean, doesn't he, doesn't he work? I thought he had a job. I mean... He's the only person I know who doesn't have anything to do all day, so. I've still got two more paintings to finish. Right, okay. -Hey. Are you jealous? -[Tom chuckles] Jealous of Leo? No, I just-- He's my friend. Okay. [door closes] [phone ringing] [phone continues to ring] I think the phone is ringing. What? -Phone? Oh, God. Jack Feldman-- -[busy tone] Sorry. I'm just a little distracted. There seems to be an epidemic around here. Annabelle, you got the list? -[Annabelle] Yes. And we have a ton of major people coming. Are you excited? Oh, yeah, I guess. -You guess? No, oh, oh, I mean, of course. And thank you again for putting me in your show. [Annabelle] I'm finished! -Oh, good. Never mind, let's see the list. Oh, good girl. Hello. -Hi. I missed you today. -Mm. That's nice. I'm going to go to bed, babe. I'm so tired. Well, you don't have to necessarily go to bed, right? -Mm-hmm. Can't we just, uh... Hmm? -You can do whatever you want, but I'm not going to participate. [mumbling] Oh. [chuckles] It's you. Yup. It's me. Just the guy who owns the place. [Rosemary chuckles] No, thank you. You know... I meant to tell you... I'm impressed. Thank you. Thank you, seriously, this is, ah... just so exciting. Don't thank me. The way you shimmied on in here. That takes real talent. Sorry? It's a shame. I could've helped you. I wanted to. But I guess it was just easier wandering around in your underwear waiting for him to notice your paintings. Yeah, it's funny. Tom usually goes for the model type. You must be a hell of a fuck. [mumbling] Hey. -Hi. Excuse me for one second. [crowd chattering] Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? What happened? Please don't make me go there. -What are you talking about? What happened, wha-- what happened? Did someone-- Look at me. Look at me. Everybody loves you in there. You got to go back in. Your stuff is great. Hey, hey, hey. I love you. You do? -You got to go back in. You really love me? -Yeah. Let's get married. [laughs] What? So, this is it. It's the last one. Oh, they spelled your name wrong. What? Bosemary. -[huffs] Well, I guess I'm lucky to even be here. That's not luck, it's karma. "Limerence." There once was a man from Nantucket. Not limerick, dumb ass. Limerence. I just, you know-- what is it? It's a self-portrait. But it doesn't look like you. It's a little part of me. Hey. -[Rosemary] Hi. Hi. Okay, weird. What, you didn't tell them? We're getting married. [Donald laughs] You did it, brother. Come here. [Donald laughs] Actually, she did it. -By a dumpster. [Donald] That's fantastic. -Very romantic. Congrats! [chuckles] You know, we've been talking about this for a while. I said it was going to happen. You said, no, it's just cool-- -It was all you. Yeah, it was me, I think I was a positive influence. [May] Just stop talking. -May, it's awesome. Congrats, dude. [May] You've talked enough. May. -Just stop talking. You've known each other for about 12 minutes. It's a bad idea. May. -I'm done. Shots? [Donald] Fuck. Hey. Donald. [gentle music] [glass shatters] So, how does it feel knowing that you're only going to have sex with one person for the rest of your life? I'm busy! Hey, will you open the door? Hah, you're waiting 'til now to write your vows? Shut up. Aren't you worried you're going to cheat on him? No. -Well, you've cheated on every guy. What, like, in high school? Come on. Yeah, if you did it then, you'll do it now. You know what they say, history loves company. No, that's wrong. History repeats itself. Misery loves company. Either way you're a cheater. Cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater. Get out of here! -Oh, my God! Seriously? You want to get stoned? -Dude. I'm about to get married. [hip hop rap music] Okay, I cannot, I can't think with this stupid music on. Oh, God, now what's wrong with the music? It's offensive! -Who the hell are you right now? I don't need this right now. Turn the music on! Turn the music off! Because-- it's not funny! It's ridiculous. You grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. And you're white. Okay, bridezilla! [groaning] Hey. Listen. You know you don't have to do this. You look really pretty. I do? Rosemary. [Rosemary] God dammit. [light music] [Tom] If you're playing hard to get still, it's not going to work. We got to go. Hey, man. Where's, where's Ro? She went for a walk. Look, dude. I don't think she wants to marry you. So... Do me a favor? Stay the fuck away from her. Rosemary's gone. [May] What? Where did she go? -I don't know. I'm going to check the other side of the property. Keep me company? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. -[May] I'm not saying anything. Ro! Ro! [May] Do you think that anybody knows? [Donald] Knows what? [May] That we're getting divorced. [Donald] I don't think anybody's paying attention to us. [May] What a mess. [Donald] At least it isn't ours. [May] Yeah. For once. [May] I'm too old for this. -[Donald chuckles] [Donald] You're not old. -[May] Yes, I am. [Donald] You're beautiful. Hey, we got to get this thing started. Where is everyone? She's gone. What did you do? I went for a walk. Yeah. I see. Do you ever feel like the person you want to be... and the person you actually are would, like, hate each other? Are you fucking kidding me right now? Sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I didn't know what to do. Which, uh... Which part's, uh, confusing you? The vows? Or the... the commitment? [sighs] Fuck off. Cause you're afraid, maybe? It's just like, it's like, different. You and me are different. It's not how it was. Why-- Why is that a bad thing? Because it sucks! And it's not what I signed up for, so... It sucks? -I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. Okay. Please can you just admit that this is different? I know that you know what I'm talking about. I know you can feel it. It's bullshit. -It's not bullshit! It's fucking bullshit! You don't just blow shit up because it gets uncomfortable. Why not? -Because you can't treat people like that! You're not the only one here. You know, I haven't painted anything, in like... forever. [Tom] So, that's what this is about? No, it's not. It's, uh... You don't even notice. What are you talking about? Of course I notice you. You're all I notice. Why'd you ask me to marry you? I have no idea. No, wait. Wait, wait, wait. It's not like that. Tom. Tom! Tom! I wish we could go back... to the way things were in the beginning. Hey, wait. Don't go. You need to grow up.

How did you do this? It's my half of the house. I'm contracted to a lifetime supply of cupcakes. It's in the fine print. [knocking] [Rosemary] Go around. [door closes] Hi. [Leo] Hey. Um... Are you okay? -Mm. Oh, yeah. I just, um, fell asleep. Sleeping. Sorry I've been so M.I.A. I just, uh... Oh, no. -I've just been really busy. Yeah, me too. Well, you look great.

Oh, no, I, uh-- -Yes, and even though we don't always see eye to eye, and you're really mean sometimes, and, you know, you yell at me a lot. This is like the worst apology ever. I know. No, I have notes. Notes I wrote. [clears throat] Dear Rosemary... I know I've been a bad friend. I'm really sorry that I hurt you. You didn't deserve that. I hope I didn't completely fuck up your life because I would hate myself forever. P.S. I miss you. P.S.S. You're still in love with him. [Leo chuckles] [May] A yellow cupcake, that's only the best and most tastiest cupcake that we have. [May] Did you have school today? Yeah, how was it? Do you like school? Good. Okay. Do you want anything else? Um, no, thank you. Here we go. A sweet treat for a sweet girl. [melancholic piano music] Are you going to share with your mom? [gentle music] Annabelle! Oh, my God! Hi! What are you doing here? -Oh, it's so good to see you. You look great. How are you? -I am great! Today's my last day. Oh, wow. You guys are together. That's, uh... -We got a house in Joshua tree. Yeah, on our way to the tree. [chuckles] Cool. -Hello, love. You look just like a girl I once knew. I am a girl you once knew. Yeah, I get ya. See you in the next life. [chuckles nervously] Is it okay if I stay and look around? Totally. -Toodles, love. Oh. Bye. [Tom] I had it leaning against the wall downstairs. I thought it looked better out here. I, um, didn't know you would be here. Where else would I be? I was, I was in the neighborhood, and, I, um-- Decided to stalk me again? -[chuckles] Well, I've only walked by here like 47 times, so-- 47? Huh. Well, 48 is the number where they give you official stalker status. So, you're, you're in the clear. [chuckles] I like your hair, by the way. Thanks. It's not, it's not too old lady-ish? No, no.
