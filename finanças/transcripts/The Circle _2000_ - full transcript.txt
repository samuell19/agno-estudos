"THE CIRCLE" PRODUCED AND DIRECTED BY JAFAR PANAHI It's a girl. Who is Solmaz Gholami? - Solmaz Gholami? - Here. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. Congratulations. The baby is born. It's a girl. - A girl? - Yes, a beautiful girl. - Yes? - Pardon me. My daughter has had a baby, but nobody's told me what it was. - Nobody told you? - No. I'm going to ask. - It's a beautiful girl. - A girl? Are you sure? But the ultrasound image showed it was a boy. Sometimes this happens. Her in-laws will be furious and ask him to divorce her. They wanted a boy. My poor daughter... Everything's going to be fine. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Hello. Sorry we came in late. They called us just now. How is our boy doing? - We haven't heard anything. - Since last night? - No, nothing. - Let's go there and ask. Excuse me. Hasn't Solmaz Gholami given birth yet? Of course she has, it's a girl. - But they expected a boy. - Are you sure? It's a girl, I'm sure. - Where are you going? - And you? I've been looking for you. - What's the matter? - It's a baby girl. - Does he know? - The whole family is upstairs. That's not good. They expected a boy. - My God. - My poor daughter. Go and tell your uncles. - Right away. - Hurry. Excuse me. Do you have any change? - No. - Thanks. - No answer. - What shall we do? - Deutschmarks? Dollars? - Where's the gold necklace? - Here. - Give me the number. Hurry. Wait here. I'll be back as soon as I sell it. Are you all alone? - What did he say? - Nothing. - Hey you, wait there! - Arezoo! Maede! What did you say? I'll teach you a lesson. - She's crazy! - You idiot! Arezoo! Arezoo! They'll take her to jail. Stop talking. Come with us. Keep moving. You can't park in here. You on the grey car, keep on driving. You're blocking the way. Get out. - How are we going to get out? - Keep the street clear. You cannot park in here. - We have free passes. - She did too. You cannot park in here. Get out. Make way. What are we going to do now? - What are we going to do? - Let's call again. - What about my gold necklace? - You can't get it now. How can we get to Raziliq? We don't have money for the bus ticket. Don't worry. I'll work something out. Let's go. - How much for the local call? - 2 tomans. Alright, give me a token. - A cigarette, please. - What brand do you prefer? Anyone costing less than 10 tomans. There's no answer. You can't smoke in here. You'll get us into trouble. You'd better not smoke. Let's go and look for Pari. - Hello, excuse me. - Hello. - You know where's Abdullah shop? - Abdullah? - Yes. - What does he do? - I was told he worked here. - Do you know the address? - Manoucheri corner. - There's no Abdullah here. There's Abbas, the paintings seller, Madji, the antiques seller... and Youssef, who sells old teapots. - Are you sure? - I've been here for 40 years. He has a daughter named Fereshteh, but everybody calls her Pari. I never heard of them. - What's his name again? - Abdullah. There's a stand over there. Abdullah is the owner's name. See if it's him. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Wait here. Arezoo. Alright, you're free to go. What are you doing? Don't take that. Wait for Abdullah to come back. Please... Don't take them. Please! - Come on. - Did you get the address? He wouldn't answer me. - His boss is not even there. - I want to show you something. - No, come on. - Please. Just a minute. What is it? Look, it's Raziliq. It's where I'm taking you. Look how beautiful it is. It's paradise. The Sabalah hills. There's a river right here. If only we could get there! It'd be the end of our problems. I used to play with my brother here. But the painter was careless. He forgot the beautiful flowers. It's been closed for 6 months. The cheese is already stinking. The stench is spreading all over. Do you know where he is? - No. Does he owe you money? - No. I haven't heard from him. Everybody's been asking. - He's probably gone into hiding. - Thanks. - We wasted the whole day searching. - Can we still manage to go? - We lost the chance. - Do you want a ride? I wish I could smoke. There must be some other way. Come on. Wait here. I won't be long. It's alright. Wait there. - Where were you? - Downstairs. Are you alright? - Hassan! - Yes? - Where are you going? - I'll be right back. Why did you leave? You were gone for too long. I spent 10 minutes looking for you. - And? - I got the money. From whom? Arezoo! Was he a relative? - Who? - That man. Yes. - Did you smoke? - I didn't have time. We have to go now, or you'll be late. Here. Take the money. - Take this too. - What about you? - I'm not going. - Why not? - I can't. Stop talking, go. - But we made a promise... - I can't go. I'm not going. - I won't leave withou you. Enough. Hurry, go. Otherwise you'll miss the bus. - But why? - Head for the bus station. Get in, hurry. Go on, darling, and don't forget: At the end of the line, you must look for the bus station. - Go on, good-bye. - Come on, get in. Arezoo! - What's the matter now? - I need to know why. It's none of your business. You're gonna miss the bus. You did everything you could to get the money. I can't go. I got scared when I touched the money. - Scared of what? - Of being rejected. Two years in prison, and nobody went to see me. What about your son? I don't know where he is, nor if he's still alive. It might be tough on him to see me again. Go on, or you'll miss the bus. Come with me. - I can't. Everywhere is the same. - No. We'll be in paradise there. I need some time. I wouldn't stand seeing that your paradise does not exist. Go. You're going to be late. Go on, please. Go, go. Don't forget. Look for the bus station at the end of the line. Alright? Take care. Good-bye. Arezoo. - What's the matter now? - Take care you too. Go on, now. Be careful. Excuse me, where can I buy tickets to Sarab? Sarab? It must be on counter 15, or 16. - Sarab is on the west... - West of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan... I think it's on counter 3. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I want a ticket to Sarab. - It's the last bus. There's no seats available. I'm in a hurry. - The seats are all taken. - No seats? None. Look again. - Please, try once more. - None. - Just the back seats. - Alright. A seat in the back. Name? Nargess Mamizadeh from Raziliq. - How old are you? - 18. Are you traveling alone? Where's your student's ID? I forgot to bring it. - I can't sell it, then. - Please. I can't sell tickets to unaccompanied women. You must have an escort or bring an ID. - I need to go home. - ID or escort. - I don't have one now. - It's your problem, not mine. - Please, just this once. - I can't. - Please, I need to go. - Are you really a student? - I can get into trouble. - I'm a student. - Really? - Yes. Alright. - You said Nargess Mamizadeh? - Nargess Mamizadeh... - From Raziliq. - Right. Are you really a student? Yes. Here. Pay to the cashier and go to the boarding platform. - How much is it? - 1,120 tomans. Where is the platform? Downstairs. You'll see the bus. Nir and Sarab, departure at 6:30 p.m. - To Sarab? - Yes.

Show me. - The white one with needlework. - With red embroidery. Latest fashion. It was made in Turkey, fine work. Very nice. A shirt for fianc?s. A really beautiful model. - You won't be disappointed. - How much is it? Choose, first. What's his size? About 20 years old. But is he fat or thin? Short or tall? Did you forget your boyfriend's size? Women are all the same, they all have bad memory. Even those who have your good taste. If the shirt does not fit, you can change it. How much is this shirt? God has sent this lad. - Come in. - I'm looking for a shirt. Come in, don't just stand there. Come inside, I'll show you. - Where are you from? - Khoramabad. - And you? - Tabriz. - Let me see the collar. - What for? Just for measuring. Is your boyfriend like him? Do they have the same size? Let's see. - I'm looking for a shirt. - This is for her, not for you. Is this the right size? Take a look. Sorry for bothering you. Mehdi, come help this lad. - How much is it? - For you, nothing. 5,200 just for you. That's not much. As long as you're happy. - Should I wrap it up for present? - Yes, please. I can show you the latest models. Here you have 5,000 tomans minus 200. Which one do you want? This one? Very good. What size? - The same as hers... - The same as the one I just sold. The 6:3O bus to Sarab! Can I help you? Is anybody there? Are you looking for someone? - Is Arezoo here? - Arezoo? Maryiam... Maryiam Parvin from Jerman. Is she German? - No, from a village in the north. - There's nobody here with that name. - Arezoo is not here? - Arezoo? Who's that? - You bought her something to drink. - She left a long time ago. - Where to? - I don't know. Hello. - Is Abdullah here? - No. - When will he be back? - I don't know. - What do you want from him? - I'm looking for his daughter Pari. - Are you alone? - She said she'd be here. Some other woman came looking for her too. Said she wanted to talk to her. That was my friend. I was waiting right there. - Do you have her address? - At the end of the street, 2nd alley. 30 Sirus Ghorbanipoor. - I'm sorry? - 30 Sirus Ghorbanipoor. Thank you. - Yes? - Hello. - What do you want? - Is Pari there? - What? - I'm looking for Pari. - What do you want? - I'm a friend of hers. - Friend? - We came out of prison today. - Have you been to my stand? - Yes. Go back to where you once belonged, you slut! Why did they let you go? You belong in prison. Go back to there. To you, Pari is dead. You're such an idiot. Why did you get out? Your life outside won't be easy. You should've stayed there. - Who is this? - Open the door, father! Quiet. The neighbors will hear you. Open the door! - We're not leaving. - Stop! - When did she get out? - This morning. And I only get to know now? Let me in! Get out of my way, father! Stop! I won't hurt her! I just want to talk to her! Calm down! Get out of my way, father! I won't hurt her! Her friends came looking for her at the stand. Hossein told me. He should've told me if anybody came looking for the address. She is here. Why did they let her go? Mohammed! Abbas! Don't let her go out! She will never step into this house again while I live. Pari, wait! - To the circle, Hossein. - Get in. Mom asked me to bring you the purse. - Thank you. - Your cigarettes. What's this? - It's for you. - I don't want your money. Be good and go back home. - Where to? - Morad Theater. I'll drop you at the circle. It's in the area. Alright. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Try to get up. Need any help? I'm fine, thank you. - Tickets, please. - I just came to see an employee. - Who? - Monir. - She's at the box office. - Thank you. Monir! Pari! What are you doing here? - I don't want to bother you... - I'm so happy to see you. Come on! Let her in. Sorry about the mess. - It's fine. - When did you get out? - This morning. - But it should've been 8 months ago. I was released and imprisoned again under certain charges. Charges against you? I've got a long record. - That's all in the past now. - Not yet. - Why not? - I ran away. Ran away? How did you do it? I escaped with a group. - But why? - I have something to do. Well, tell me... - Are you alright? - Yes. Listen... I'm looking for Elham. Have you heard of her? - Elham who? - Elham Saboktakin. She was in prison for 5 years but nobody knew the reason. - The pseudostudent? - Yes. She came to visit me last year. - One, please. - There you go. She told me she was getting married. One never knows about her. I never got the invitation nor heard from her again. - Is she working at the hospital yet? - I guess so. Which one? I can take you there, it's on my way home. Is your husband coming to pick you up? He's a driver for some company, always out on trips... a month here, 6 months traveling. Kashan, Isphahan... Hello. - Are you almost done? - Yes, come in. - She's wife number two. - Your husband got another wife? I found out coming out of prison. Nobody had told me anything. At the beginning... my daughter was afraid of me and used to hide behind her. But now that I came to know her, I realized she's a good person. She took care of my children for 4 years. She quit her job to take care of them. But she's still the second. - May I? - Yes, please. - I realized you had a guest. - Thank you. - Help yourself. - Thank you. Thank you very much. She's called Pari, too. In fact, Parvaneh. I call her Pari after you. What about the children? The girls are at home, but Ali is out. - Where is he? - With a friend. He and his friends! Do you still have to do a lot of time? Yes, a lot. Was that man released? No. Did you marry him, then? How much time does he still have to do? He was executed. When? 3 or 4 months ago. Did you see him again? They allowed us to be together his last night. My God! It's there. Come to my house afterwards. Let me give you the address. No. I have some business with Elham. Tell her I would've visited her too if it weren't for the kids. I'll tell her. Thank you. - Should I pick you up later? - There's no need, thanks. Pari! Do I owe you money? - No, why would you? - I was always broke in prison. No. - I don't remember who I owe to. - You owe us nothing. Everybody loved you very much. Except for Zari, but she's eased up. - Don't you really need money? - No. - Take care. - Don't worry. - Bye. - Bye. I'm looking for Mrs. Saboktakin. - Elham Saboktakin? - Yes. - I think she's not in. - Could you call her, please? Elham Saboktakin, please come down at the front desk. - Doctor Kazemi is in. - No, I need to talk to her. Let me check her time card. She's here, probably at the Emergency Room. Thank you. I'm sorry, but you have to wear a chador. I wasn't aware. I haven't got one. - It's required. - What can I do? - Do you have some ID? - I don't have that either. - Who are you looking for? - Mrs. Saboktakin, from the ER. Alright, take this. But bring it back, please. Thank you very much. - Pari! Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine. I'm so happy to see you're out. - But it isn't over yet. - Really? Come on. - How did you find me? - Monir told me. Congratulations. - On what? - On your marriage. - Thank you. - Who is he? A relative? No. He's a doctor here. - Which speciality? - Ears, nose, and throat. Come here. - The doctor was looking for you. - Thank you. Have you heard from your parents lately? Sit down. I didn't go back to Anzali. Just once, when he proposed to me. To tell you the truth, I've been avoiding my family. Are you happy? Very. He is a good man, from a good family. I have a home, a life. He has a daughter from his first marriage. He's not so old, though. His ex-wife didn't please him. They were relatives, but she wasn't good for him. He's invited me many times to visit his family in Lahore. - He's from Pakistan. - Really? - But I've never been there. - Why not? What if they stop me at the border? He knows nothing from my past. I'm afraid he might find out. You've changed so much. What did you say? - Yes? - Elham. I'm coming. - Yes? - Are you alone? - Yes. - You just arrived? - Mahin wouldn't fall asleep. - You were called. I know, it was nothing. Are you going home soon? I'm just about finished. - So Mahin didn't go to sleep? - I managed to make her to. - Don't be long, I need you. - I'm coming. Wait here. - Listen, I need your help. - What for? I'm pregnant. Pregnant? - But you're not married. - I need to have an abortion. I tried other places, but had no luck. - How old is the fetus? - Almost 4 months. Everybody wants the husband's permission or the ID and... you're in an advanced stage of pregnancy. I told them my husband died. Now they want his parents permission. I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. Wait here. I won't be long. - Excuse me. - Yes? I'm looking for Mrs. Saboktakin. - She's at the ER. - No, she's with Dr. Kazemi. Dr. Kazemi is at Unit 3. Thank you. - What are you doing here? - I couldn't stay there. You can't stay by this door. - I was looking for you. - Did my husband see you? I wanted to see him and meet the source of your pride and happiness. - You should've stayed there. - I haven't got much time. Go to the dressing room. I'll take a look and meet you there. My daughter is dead! My God, my daughter is dead! Excuse me. Mrs. Saboktakin, please. - Call Mrs. Saboktakin. - She's busy. - It's urgent. - She's busy. She tried to commit suicide. - What happened? - I don't know. But if she survives, there'll be a scandal in the family. - How did that happen? - We don't know yet. - For what reason? - How am I to know? What am I going to do? I don't know, I don't know of anybody. With so many doctors in here?! Who would accept? You know as well as I do... The first pregnancy, 4 months already... without the father's permission and no document whatsoever! - Who would accept? - Your husband. He's a doctor, he knows people. How can I ask him? What can I tell him about you? What about the husband's permission? What would I tell him? - You never smoked before. - Now I do. You're in a hospital, you can't smoke in here. I feel like it. I couldn't smoke all day. Sometimes I even chew tobacco. - Your dinner is getting cold. - I don't want to eat. Take this, you might need it. There's nothing I can do. Where are you going? I'll call you, if I work something out. Never mind. My husband knows nothing about my past. Nor him, nor the hospital... You made him curious. He asked who you were. I'm so sorry. Do you remember you used to think I didn't like you? Well, I never hated you. Not even now. But you've changed so much. So much! Come on, pick up the phone. - Please, have you got any change? - Here. - Could you dial for me? - Sure. What's the number? If a man answers the phone, call Zahra. If not, hand it to me. - Who do I say I am? - A friend. - It's a child. - Ask for Zahra. I want to speak to Zahra. Watch out for the patrols. Hello. How are you? Your voice sounds strange. Is your husband home? You're the one who wanted that jerk. Now you have to raise his children. I miss you. Why don't you come and see me? Are you alright? Do you need any help? I couldn't before. - I'm on sentinel duty. - I'm fine. Can't you go out a little? That's not good, Mom. How are the kids? Are they getting along with the others? I don't know if I'll be on duty next Friday. I promise. If I can. - Does this belong to your child? - Thank you. See? We found it. We'll put it in here so it won't fall out again. Do you know of any hotel or boardinghouse around here? - Right there. - Thanks. - Where is your Mom? - I don't know. - You don't know? Is this bag yours? - Yes. - Did you drop it? Where's your Mom? - My Mom? I don't know where she is. - Where did she go? - I don't know. Did she leave you alone? What did she tell you? "I'll be back." - What did she tell you to do? - To stay here. To stay here and not leave? Yes. - Where did she go? - I don't know. I want my Mom. I'm scared. I'll find your Mom. Which way did she go? Are you her Mom? - No. - I thought she was your daughter. - You didn't see her Mom? - No, just the child. - But her Mom was here, I saw her. - I was busy, I didn't see anything. Don't cry, we're going to find your Mom. This good lady is going to find her. - I want my Mom. - Take care of her, I won't be long. Ma'am... Do you have a cigarette? Here. - What about a light? - No. A good family will take her in. She'll get sick with melancholy. It'll take some time, but she will be fine. She's so sweet, she'll be loved. All children seem wonderful to their parents. Stop that or I'll change my mind. My heart is broken. This is the third time I've tried to leave her. I thought... I'd never have the courage to abandon her. Some family will find her... and take her away. A future awaits for her somewhere. Then she'll be safe. God knows how much I've suffered. It's not easy. No mother can abandon her child without regretting it. Nobody has taken her in yet. The social service will take care of her. She'll be better off. How can you say that? What about you? Why didn't you check in the hotel? I can be looking for something else. Whether a boardinghouse or not... wherever you go, you'll need a passport, some ID... or a pass from the police. Without a man, there's no place you can go. Maybe. Now go and rescue your daughter. How about a ride? Come on, get in. What's going on over there? I'm in trouble! Please, do something. Tell them we're relatives. Tell them we're married. I'm Nayereh and my daughter's Neghar. IDs. Good evening, Hajji. How are you? - Are you alright? - Fine. We've got a problem. - What's the matter? - They're not helping. - See for yourself. - Let me through. It's not what you think, Hajji. - Then why did you get in the car? - Because you stopped. That's no reason. That was my first time. Please, let me go. I have a daughter. My daughter is all alone in the streets. If I don't go, I'll lose her. Everything was a big mistake. It won't happen again. Please, let me go. Don't make things difficult. The van is on the way. I beg you. Good evening, Hajji. How are you? His papers and insurance. - Everything is okay. - What's your relation to her? She's just a passenger. - What happened? - Ask your men. - Are you relatives? - No. - Did he force you to get in the car? - No. Then why did you? Are you paying the bills, honey? Throw this gum away and tidy up your scarf. Please, Hajji. I'm not like that. She could be my daughter. I was going home. - Did you call home? - Why? Your family left a message. Family pictures... My employee's papers... She could be my daughter. Please, let me go. She was alone in the street. I pitied her. I have no time for that! I work hard all day and at night... I try to earn a little extra with this piece of junk. I need to feed my family. Please, let me go. Have you no shame? If there were others, I would've given them a ride too. - Where were you coming from? - The station. And she was all alone! Such a bad weather, there was no one else around. Besides, it's not ilegal. Put that camera away. They're recording, Hajji. - Are we on the tape? - Yes. It's just a wedding tape. It won't be shown. Let them go. Thank you, Hajji. Let's go, guys. These are my wife and daughter. It's not what you think. She's just a passenger. Give me my papers back. Let me kiss your hand. My papers, please. I have to work tomorrow. Think of my reputation. - Go home and don't get in trouble. - Sure, sure. Thank you. Seen what you put me through? To the van. Move! Where are you from, pal? It doesn't matter. And you? - I'm from Rhoramshahr. - And him? - Abadan. - Me too. - Which area? - Baham Shir. Do you know Hassan Jashour? - The soccer champion? - Yes. I do. Do you know Khalou Hassan? - Yes. - Is he still alive? I don't know. He's got a beautiful voice. Have you heard him singing? Yes. Can you sing like him? Please, sing, I'm feeling sad. - Shut up! Where do you think you are? - Please, let him sing. We're all feeling down. Put this cigarette out. You can't smoke here. Sorry. My friend is depressed. - He asked me to sing. - Sit down and remain seated. - Want to light one up? - I can't, I'm on duty. The other soldier's asleep, and that guy is my friend. The driver wants to smoke. Come on, just one. Then you can tell me if you liked it. You're a nice fellow. I like you. - What brand is this? - What's the difference? It's for free. They're smooth. Here, let me light it up. You're nice. What about you, boss? - Here. - Thanks, but I don't smoke. Come on, try one. The boss is smoking. - Go have a seat. - Alright. - Take one for your friend. - He doesn't smoke. - Then light one up for me. - Okay. Here. Thank you. Get inside. Go on! Guard! Guard! - My medicine. It's in my purse. - Talk to the chief later. Yes? Sorry, sir. I didn't know who it was. At your service. Yes, of course. Sure, sure. A moment. Solmaz Gholami? Is there a Solmaz Gholami in here? - Is your name Solmaz Gholami? - No. No, sir. She's not here. Yes. I think she was transferred to Annex 5. Yes. Sure. Anything else? Good-bye. C APTIONS BY VIDEOLAR
