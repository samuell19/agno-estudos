[explosion] [sizzling] [intense] [spooky music] [music starts to fade] Ahh! [heavy breathing] This is the most frightening movie, and these are only the opening credits! I don't know what I'm gonna do! Greetings from Tromaville! I'm Lloyd Kaufman, president of Troma Entertainment and creator of the Toxic Avenger. And the film you are about to see is probably one of the most horrifying, and downright bloodcurdling creations that I have ever witnessed in my fifty years of Troma filmmaking! Yep! The Killer Shrews! A movie about redemption, hope... and ice cream. Ah, yes. The year was 1959. Eisenhower was president. Communism was flourishing, the music was dying... and I... I was getting out of prison. I'll never forget it. And who could forget those wonderful dogs wearing mops?! And I know mops. Just ask ol' lumpy head back there. Killer shrews... ...murderous Muppets! Yes! There's no business like shrew business! It's now time to sit back, relax... ...munch on some delicious popcorn with that artery-hardening butter stuff they put on it... ...and get ready to watch the amazing reimagining of Ken Cosentino's Attack of the Killer Shrews! [creepy music starts] [slap] [slap] [slap] Svenson! We're going to be rich beyond our wildest dreams! That's great, sir! See, Svenson? It's working! My children are growing! My serum is working! You did it sir! No, Svenson.... we did it! [purring] Look Svenson!!! Look how big it's getting!! Uh, sir?! I think I will call it Nibbles! [shrew screeching] [Svenson screaming] Nibbles! Stop it! Nibbles! Stop eating him! Nibbles! [roaring, gurgling] [laughter] Oh, Charles.. Thank you again for inviting us. It's a pleasure, darling! You too, Lewis. Thank you, Charles. [cork popping] [champagne pouring] Maybe once we're finished with our drinks, the professor can you show his shrunken head collection from South Africa! Oh how exciting! I'd love to see it! Here's to a successful first run! Here here! [glasses clank] Congratulations! [whispering] I couldn't have done it without you, Lewis... Charles.. you know I'm more than just your agent, I'm your biggest fan! Would you give us a preview reading, professor? Please? Ha! If you insist! We'd be delighted! Please... Make yourselves comfortable, actually... This'll be brief! ....from the prologue... Oh! Nary a quest has been ventured, in the scrolls of the history of man.. ..where one educated physicist has determined an exact equation for the heart and soul of mankind. Darwin! Maxwell! Einstein! They will quiver and cringe in the shadow of I... ..Professor Charles Perry. Brilliant, Charles! Marvelous! Thank you! Thank you! Well, I'll have to reread this when Fiona arrives! Fiona Rae?! The movie starlet?? The one and only! She's coming here? Now?! How's my hair?? You look great.. She should be here already... I wonder what's taking her so long...? What the fuck is that?! [steam hissing] [engine thumping] [door slam] Having trouble ma'am? [thud] Ow! Woah! Hold on! You alright? I'm fine.. Ya sure you're OK? I know CPR... What's CPR? It's this new breathin' thing... say! Don't I recognize you's from somewheres? I get that a lot.. Where were you headin' miss? I was just going up the road... Mulberry Street? I was supposed to meet some friends for a small gathering... and then the engine started knocking and all this smoke poured out. Well, I can give you a ride there if you'd like? It's on my route anyway. Are you sure you don't mind? No absolutely! I wouldn't want to be a bother... Nonsense! You'd be surprised how lonely it can get in the car! Especially without Wayne... Come on! Hop in! I'll give ya a ride! I'll get my bag! Does your friend have a phone? Yes. Alright! We'll just call a tow truck once we get inside. You're too kind! Your friend sure does like his privacy! Don't we all... [knocking] Feeeee-ooooh-nuh!!! Charles!! [muttering] I see you brought a guest with you.. I'm Charles Perry, welcome to my humble abode! Martin Blake! Come on in, darling, we're having the most choice discussion about my book! You too Officer Drake! Blake, sir! Please come in.. Come and have a drink with us! I'd love to but I'm on the clock. Mineral water for officer...[stammering] Blake... [dryly] Blake... Charles, I was so afraid I wasn't going to make it! Fiona! My dear! So good to see you! Lewis! Oh... there it is... the smell that won't go away... Allow me to introduce you to my better half, the lovely Cassandra! Cassandra? So beautiful! I am such a huge fan Miss Rae! May I call you Fiona? [whispering] Fiona Rae! Yes please! I am such a huge fan! I've seen all of your films! Some of them twice! Haha why? You're Fiona Rae! I am, yes! Wow! To think I had a movie star in my car! Wait til Wayne hears about this! Charles, I hate to trouble you, but may I please use your phone? I have to call a tow truck. Of course, my dear! Cassandra! Be a dear, would you please? And help Fiona with her....personals? Certainly! Use the phone in the study! Thank you. You two will have much to talk about... Quite a place you've got here, Professor! It's a roof over my head, y'know...really... I do beg your pardon! This man is Lewis Fontana, my agent! Sheriff Blake! Please to meet you Sheriff...[slimy squishes]...thanks for keeping us safe. Just doing my duty. Why does a professor need an agent? I've simply published my latest book! It's a Symposium of History's Greatest Scholars! Non-fiction. We were just celebrating. Well, don't celebrate too hard. Congratulations, Professor, but I really must be going. So soon! But you've practically just got here! I'm on patrol. And what could possibly happen way out here? [sticks breaking] Where are you, you Shrewish bastards?!? Ahhh! There you are!! You really can't stay? Positive. You're all in grave danger!!! Friend of yours? [parlor music plays] Doctor... you must be putting us on? I am dead serious! There are gigantic killer shrews roaming these woods! We must all leave! There is no more time for discussion! Calm down! We know shrews aren't that big.. These ones are!!! Professor... this is some sort of prank, right? You must listen! I was experimenting...with a cure for rabies... ...when something went very wrong! These shrews...are RAVENOUS! What's a shrew? It's like a mole. Cute! Cute?! These shrews are not cute!! Have you not been listening to anything that I've said?! They are.... vicious killers! These are... KILLER SHREWS!! [dun dun DUN!] Fiona dear! Sounds like the plot for your next picture! I don't think that's very funny.... he's obviously disturbed... Come on, doc! Let's getcha home! You're all going to die!! Don't you see?! You're all going to die!! Don't make me cuff you! What a ghastly man! After you! [scary music plays] [screams!] [roaring, shrew noises] [growling] Help! Heeelp! [shrew noises] Help me!!! Heeelp! Heeeelp meeee! [roaring] Help me! [roaring] Please help me!! [shotgun blast] [growling] [BLAM!] [danger music fades] [whispering] What the fuck IS that thing?? What is it?! I don't know.. What the HELL do you think it is?? It's a killer shrew! He was telling the truth! Is it a dog? No it's not a damn dog! It's a SHREW! [cocks shotgun] We have to get out of here! Sweetheart, we need to leave! No one is going anywhere! And on who's authority? He's right, it's not safe out there.. I need to radio for back up! Doctor! How many of those things are out there? Thirty! Well... twenty-nine now! This is Sheriff Blake! I'm in a house on Mulberry Street and we're in need of assistance! [radio] You OK Sheriff? Can someone please help me?! We have one wounded a big problem on our hands! Send a squad car and an ambulance immediately! There's a first aid kit in the W.C. I-I'll get it! I'm coming with you! Watch your step... these are new shoes! Ew.. [radio] The ambulance is in Springville assisting in a house fire! I'll head over to you now! [radio] What's the address? What's your address? Three-eight-zero Mulberry Street. Three-eighty Mulberry Street. Did you say Springville? That's two hours away! Don't they have their own ambulance? [radio] No! Blake! What's going on out there? I'm not sure, I think... I think it might be KILLER SHREWS!! [dun dun DUNNN!] [radio] Haha OK! Wayne out! How many officers do you have, Sheriff? Well it's just me and Wayne on the clock right now... He IS my deputy, AND my cousin! Two officers! You're going to need more than that! You're telling me- EW! Your wounds are all....goopy! Which one? The one on your neck! It's really gross! Lewis is on his way with the first-aid kit! Oh.. THAT'S good! [disgusting weasel farts] [poop noises] This is terrible.. I know! Those things are so scary! No, this book. This book is terrible. Then why do you represent him? Because he's rich... in fact, this whole shrew thing just might make it easier for us to find his safe.. I think we should just forget the whole thing. Nonsense! All we have to do.... is sneak away... open the safe, grab it and go! [horrific farting] You should light a candle or something... that smells awful! It was the casserole... I love the one where you use the snake to swing from the cliff! That was Return to Ape Island! Wow! Fiona Rae! I knew I recognized you from somewhere! Say.. ..can I have your autograph when this is all said and done? Sure! Why not? Here you go Professor. So doc, why were you really messing with those shrews? [weakly] I told you... I was trying to create a cure for rabies... But HOW did they turn into THAT? Something went wrong....OBVIOUSLY! I...I have to make an emergency phone call. Use the phone in the study. Those things are probably miles away by now. Doubtful! Those are predatory animals! They will go where the prey is! What? You mean US?! Yes! They've tasted blood... when they killed my lab assistant... I have to go, I can't stay here! You can't go! It's too dangerous out there! But you don't understand! I have to be on set tomorrow morning, I have a very early call time! OK. Once the tow truck arrives, I'll escort you. They're not coming. No one answered the phone! Well where do you have to go? Franklinville? I was only supposed to be in town for one day! I have to leave! Well, once Wayne gets here I'll take you. No I would prefer to leave now! We're not going anywhere 'til my backup arrives. How are you gonna get in without the combination? I'll think of something. [creepy sliding noise] Did you hear something? Do you think they got in the house? Come on! Let's go back with the others! You go on ahead. I'm not leaving 'til I've gotten into the safe. Lewis! Go on! [parlor music continues] This man is going into shock! We've got to get him to a hospital! [gurgling] What's wrong with him? [stammering] BLEEDING! [ominous music begins] That's Wayne! We're saved! Wayne! Come in Wayne! I'm here Sheriff! Wayne you listen to me and you listen to me carefully! We have a man down who is in need of medical assistance! Be careful getting out of your vehicle! There are monstrous KILLER SHREWS! All over the grounds! Yea, ok Sheriff. Killer shrews! [monstrous growling] [shrew noises] [zap zap zap!] [BLAM!] [gunshots] That's my cousin! Did it getcha?! It took a chunk off my damn ear!!! We gotta get everybody to the hospital! ...but we can only take one of you! You go! Thank you Charles. Perry you cover us while we get the doc to the car! Aye! [bloody gurgling] [ominous music intensifies] Good luck, my dear! Be safe, Professor! Let's get the Hell outta here! Wait for help to arrive! We'll be back soon! [shrew noises] [shotgun blast] [growling, shrew noises] [shotgun blast] [whimpering] Where's Lewis? He's in the study...did they leave us?! They're sending help. We just need to... sit tight...

I tried to stop them- John, we got a big problem on our hands, a shit storm is a-brewin' out there in the shape of big ass killer shrews, and you're in here napping'! What is the meaning of this? Your town is being overrun by ravenous rodents! People are dying out there! Floyd... Why is Fiona Rae in my office and you didn't warn me? I look like shit! Sir! Sorry- Get out! Get out and get Miss Rae a cup of tea please! Oooh! Earl Grey. Yea... that guy's a retard. Mayor, I've seen one of these things... they're huge! We need to shut down the town! A curfew is in effect immediately! We need to exterminate the infestation before it spreads. My God, could things get any worse? Sir... your wife just called... ..your dog died. Pugsly? My little Pugsly? Sir! The town is a war zone! This is terrible! I think the mayor's gone bye-bye... What do you need from us, Captain? Let's step outside for a minute... give him a moment. [sniffling] My little Pugsly... First Wayne, now Pugsly... what's going on in this town? Mayor major wuss.. We need a map of the town. Close down all the streets coming and going. Done! We need to gather as much intel on these things as we can... find out what makes them tick. They're shrews, how complicated can they be? Girlie, you have no idea. How much further? I don't know, I was following you! Are you serious? Yea! I thought you knew! Who is this guy? I don't really know... The name's Wilkens, I own the saw mill you guys stopped at. So you own the mill, but you have no idea where we are right now? I never come this way! [shrew noises] Ahhhhhh! Cassandra! Eeeeeeeee!!! Cassandra! They're right behind us! Cassie!! And what's this here? That's the old saw mills...it's in the outskirts of the city. I can see that. It's a good vantage point. Take a couple of guys and get there. Make sure it's secure.. ..leave my men there and we'll rendezvous back here at fifteen-hundred. Sure thing. And I'm gonna deeter some skeeters with my Deter Insect RepellentC©. Fiona! Fiona Rae... you are one lucky guy. It's not what you think. Sir, you're needed back at the barracks right away. Thank you Mrs. Rae!! Looks like I'm gonna have to scoot. Duty calls. The town is on lockdown, and I think you'll be safest by staying here. Can't I come with you? Not this time. Way too dangerous. If you say so.. I do. I'll see you soon. [sentimental score] Blake! Blake! You kill those shrews! [DING!] [low, creeping tone] Cassie! Cassandra! Careful with the yellin', boy! The reverberations can bring this whole thing down on us! Better that than eaten by shrews. I just can't believe it's happening again.. What do you mean "again"? Eeee!! I wanna go to Bermuda!! OK...OK! We can do that.. These shrews'll be on us any minute! Let's follow the creepy Scottish guy.. Come on, let's take this tunnel! This is a dead end! Well that's good! We'll get our back against the wall! We're trapped! How is that good? Well they can't sneak up on us, the sneaky bastards! Wilkens, this isn't your first encounter with killer shrews... is it... You youngsters take a seat and I'll tell you a tale. I come from the village of Killiecrankie. I've never heard of that before? It's in Scotland. I left when I was a wee boy. It seems I brought these creatures with me.. That doesn't make any sense. What do you mean? Ah it was a long time ago... huge man eating shrews stormed the village wiping out everything in their path! I was lucky. Me and a few others.. That doesn't make any sense. Murdock told us that he created them in his lab when he was experimenting with a cure for rabies... ..it just doesn't make sense. How could they have gotten here from Scotland? Murdock, eh? There was a Murdock in the village... crazy guy. Our parents told us not to talk to him. That seems highly coincidental.. Or not! You kids don't have to sit on the ground, there's plenty boxes! Holy shit! Hot diggity! This'll blow them up! [shrew noises] Derrr duhh duhhh buhhh! I'll keep them busy, you guys go! That's what the professor said and he's not coming back! Ah, I'm old. I've had my fun.. Go to the saw mill, there's a shoe box in my office... you'll find everything you're lookin' for.. ..Murdock, I should have known. [shrew noises] [dramatic music] [fuse ignites] [hissing] Alright, ya rat bastard shrew sonsabitches! COME AND GET IT! Hahahaha! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! [screaming] [hiss, shrew noises] [KA-BOOM!] [crickets] There it is! I've never had to shit so bad in my life! Lewis! EVER!! Hold it!!! Oh thank God we're saved!

Hey get this: That doctor guy? Murdock? Seems like he's got an interesting family tree... Oh? His grandfather went nuts in a small Scottish village! He created gigantic murderous shrews! Wipin' out every man, woman and child for miles! Oh my God! How is that possible? Well, he told us he was looking for a rabies cure. What he was really doing was following in his grandfather's footsteps. Now obviously he's a few cans short of a six pack. But after he succeeded... He created gigantic killer shrews! I don't know if he planned on having them escape, but they did! I think he was going to use them to conquer the town... maybe even conquer the world! This is complete madness! How did I even get here? Well, your car broke down and- This is so much like a movie! Giant killer rodents! An evil scientist with a chip on his shoulder! A glamorous leading lady... If this were a movie, this would be the third act! The third act! What's that?? It means we're about to reach the climax... [BLAM!] [rustling] It just went off! It just went off!

We gotta go! We're out! Do you think I can get your autograph now? Absolutely. Make it out to Martin. [giggle] Miss Rae. Sheriff.... we're leaving, and I suggest you do the same. Something wrong Cap'n? They're on their way. Oh no, they're here already! Quiet! But I thought you said this place was safe? From the shrews, yes... well, maybe. But not from the big-ass nuke that's about to hit the city! [together] WHAT?!? I've said enough! Men, we're out! Get the door, son. [roaring] [machine gun fire] [screaming] Kill 'em men! Shoot!
