Well then? Where were you? Here? Were you over here? I don't remember now. Now we shall see. Captain, proceed. Take off his handcuffs. You're Serafini? - Yes. - Where were you? - Here. You may stay there. So, Nardi, where would you like to put yourself? - I don't know! Stand there. Your Honor, allow me to say that we'd appreciate if Nardi himself of his own free will "neque vi" showed the Court the exact position in which he found himself when... Alright, Counsel. Put yourself where you like. Good. He was here. - Here? - Here. What shall I do now? - You must re-enact the whole thing. There, that's Nello. That's Oreste. And that one with the mustache is me, Adelaide. How many tears! How much joy! Have you ever loved? Have you ever suffered for love? You haven't? Then why are you watching? Come on, move along! Move along! Is he awaiting trial or not? L'Unit? Day A DRAMA OF JEALOUSY (with all the details) Read and spread the Communist press Adelaide, are you still scared? Scared? Not in the least! I'd like to stay here forever! It's just like flying! Fly, dove! Give me your hand. Not enough? This is the last ride. I'll switch off the current. More! Are we going or not? Hurry up! We're about finished. - Who's coming with us? - I've got a bike, thanks. Bye Bertocchi! - Bye. - Good night, comrades. Good night?! Good morning! - Whatever. No sleep since Friday. Be sure to show up at the branch. Maselli's giving a speech. He's coming specially. What about this? One... Two... Three... Four... Bye! I'm going to bed. - Will you take me along? In that case, she'd take me since I'm a man-about-town and an acknowledged playboy. Yeah. All I need is a playboy. He got drunk tonight. - Look at this handstand! Will we all get into this jalopy? - Sure we will. Know what? Tomorrow, I'm going to play ill. - And I'll play doctor. Stop biting me! You're tasty as an exotic fruit and I'll bite you. - Stop it! And Adelaide? - She's got her own car. Adelaide! Adelaide, we're going now! Who are you? I'm Adelaide. What do you mean? My name is Adelaide. I didn't mean you. I meant the blowfly. - The blowfly? Well, it brings good news. You've lost a bet. You kissed me as a penance. Or you're a dream. - No, it was bound to happen. I'm sure your name's Fernando. - My name's Oreste. Oreste? - Oreste Nardi. Oreste is a nice name, too. It's even much prettier. Yeah? Even though you don't know me you've been in my thoughts a long while, you know? - Really? The first time I saw you, it was many, many years ago. As a boy, you had blond hair. - You saw me? Yes. - Where? - Well... I don't remember where. Maybe you were sleeping just like now, on a river bank. But, the second time I saw you... That was... last autumn. At the shooting gallery. At the Four Winds Square. You, gentleman, with the hat. Come here! Would you like to try, sir? Come here! You handsome bricklayer. That's what she told me, Your Honor. She saw me at the shooting gallery. Are you sure? It doesn't seem to us that Adelaide Ciafrocchi worked at a fair. I must be mistaken. It's been so long. Yes, Adelaide... It was unlike her. I remember she told me that she'd seen me at Verano. "Today's a lovely day." Repeat after me: Did you know you pronounce English much better while eating? ...it's a lovely day, either because we're happy or the sun is shining. In that case, we'd say: There he goes! Who? How cute he is! Who? That blockhead? Gimme a break! - Leave me alone. What's cute about him? He looks like a slob to me. Lunatic. I've got the feeling that his name's Fernando. I feel it. Alright. So, Miss Ciafrocchi first approached Nardi at the L'Unit? Day. And then? After that evening, what happened? Nardi! I'm speaking to you! Right now I don't remember too well but those days were unforgettable. Seven months. One better than the other. We loved each other endlessly. On Sunday, we'd go to these Italian beaches of ours the whole world is jealous of but which are nothing but dirt. Tar, dead cats, trusses... French letters! Please, keep to the subject! - Your Honor... Did you know that two lovers in Rome don't know where to set their feet on because it's all a mountain of garbage? Seven hills. Seven hills of garbage! It's the dirtiest town in Europe! The foreigners say it stinks. But the local politicians stink more! They're only capable of... ...power for positions... - That's enough! Understood? Alright. My love! Here it comes. - The same one? - Yes, it follows me all the time. Well, the blowfly of our love, no? A bit disgusting. It'd be nicer if it were a butterfly. Red Fox to Base K. Red Fox to Base K. Today, December 21, 1944 we set foot on the Mindanao beach. Gen. Yamashita's men took flight. Lt Thompson has been shot. Taking over command. Sgt McCowelly. Can't you go play somewhere else? - Why don't you go? Look at him. No, it was an ambush, sir. Over and out! They're playing Americans, these idiots! As soon as you spot the Japs, fill them full of lead. Any questions? Damn you! Damn you! Catch me! Not again. I'm coming! Wait! Catch me! - Wait for me! Ugo! Listen! I never told you what Adelaide's skin is like. As smooth as silk. And her mouth, when she smiles, is a carousel of teeth. You can't spot her among the flowers. She looks like a flower. She's a flower seller. - I know! - She has a bad habit. She whispers some words in my ear. How to put it? Naughty ones. Faggots! That's it. Listen! When we go to the movies, I put my arm around her like this. She takes my hand... Give me your hand. - Let it go. Come on, Oreste! It's ready. - I'm coming. See you. Ugo, she's the greatest! Do you love me, darling? I do, my love. Do you love me? I love you like a madman! - Oh, my! Really? I'm gonna eat you! I'll eat you! Oreste... ...and wine. - Yes, bite me! I'm gonna eat you. One of a kind! You can do anything to me. Ask me anything. Next Sunday, vote the Communists! Oreste? - Yes, darling? I know so little about you. You never tell me anything about your past. I'm a man without past. Before I met you, I was terribly sad. Especially evenings with the family. Because evening's the saddest time. My job as a bricklayer gave me no joy at all. I was tied up inside like... like a stuffed roll. I thought I was sick. Inside my stomach I heard voices, mysterious footsteps... I saw ugly faces. Anyhow, I wouldn't know. Good night. - Good night. She said she wanted to do a partition. Here's the partition. This was my everyday life. Nobody knows how it was. Never a single word. I don't mean a kind one, but not rude either. Yet, this man used to love me. He loved my kids, too. Yes, he was always working. There was no one like him. But, at least, a little fondness... Devotion... Nothing. A stranger in the house. He started cutting letters of the alphabet out of the papers. Each night a different one. Once, he got angry because he found few Hs. The psychoanalyst said: "It's nothing." I replied: "Let's hope so." What's your wife like? Is she pretty? She's really something. What was it? A love match? A love affair? What? Tell me. What do you want me to say? She had already had a husband. A murderer who, during the war, made sausages out of corpses. He got a life sentence. She was left alone with those two kids by her previous marriages with unknown men. I married her because... Meanwhile, the lifer died from colitis. That's all. - A delicate story. Well, so-so. You've drunk it all! The man of my destiny... I will give you oblivion. Silvana Ciafrocchi, Adelaide's elder sister. I knew there would be trouble. I said that to my sister, last October, while she was driving me to work. I've always known what's best for you. But a married man... No. Sincerely not. Marriage is an infrangible sacrament. And whoever disturbs it, commits a sin that can't turn out well. What's it to me? It's going to be a flare-up with the inscription: "This is the life!" Why do you cross yourself? - Don't be like this. Come to yourself. Can't you drive a bit faster? I'll be late for work. You know I want the best for you. I'm saying this for your good. In Father Riccardo's name too. Remember him? He asks about you all the time. - Tell him I ask about him, too. You need to settle down. Take the seamstress' son. Such a decent sort of chap. Your word would be enough. - I'll speak the word. I'm the Phoenix! Oreste is my man! Think about it, Adelaide. I will. - Good girl. Think about his poor wife. You can't destroy a family. Be Christian. See you! Remember: if his wife finds out, we'll be in all the papers, you know? And who the devil cares? Hi, Debora! What a swindle that train route. Everybody's laying foundations before the deadline. We've laid the foundations for 11 houses. He says: "We'll pay you for overtime. What you want?" "I'm fed up! That's what I want. Is this life?" The builder came today to check the work. Paying the American girl, his girlfriend, Miss-dunno-what... His feet are hot. Mine are damp. I feel dampness growing on me. Because I'm a fool! I figured out he's seeing a woman. I'll go see the officer and tell him: "Do something!" Adultery is no longer punishable by law. - No? Then, what shall I do? Accept it. Accept it? What if I didn't want to? Where are you going? Come over here, Ma'am. Of course I will. Are you Adelaide? - Here she is! What would you have? Leave Oreste alone! You came here on purpose? Your trip was pointless. Oreste is my man. And I'm his woman who gave him joy he had never felt before! You're his mother. You should know that. I'm his wife, you ugly rascal! Help! The old woman wants to kill me! She wanted to kill me. I'll never leave him! Never! That man is mine by nature's law! Mine! Mine, sister! Mine! That man is in my blood! No one can take him away from me. I'll never leave him! I love you! I love you like a madman! Careful! Careful! My shoulder is in plaster. How pretty they are! Gladiolas, at this season... Did they charge you plenty? My darling! We'll start a new life together. - Yeah? And your wife? How old is she? You see, when we got married, she was... pretty. But I left her. It's over, Adelaide! I'm a free man! - Yes, free. Free, free... I broke the chains. No more ties, family... I left. What is it? How did your wife take it? How did she take it? Well, fine. She's a... superior woman. Superior? At the hospital, they thought I got run over. How did you break it to her? - I said to her... Antonia, no tears. I give you back your freedom. You can start a new life. You can find another man. That's what I told her. What's that? It's a magazine supplement. You see? Sunglasses, simple and... basic, created by a famous designer who got his inspiration from the Polynesian glasses. But you can't see anything. Sorry, if you don't open them... You're crying? I'm not. - What? I feel a strange sensation in the pit of my stomach. Naturally. Come on with the pizzas! It's like... remorse. A foreboding. I can't explain now. - About what? Oreste, should you, one day leave me too I'll kill you. - It's hardly likely. Leave you? It's like leaving myself. I've a better idea. Kill me. I like it better. Okay. I'll do as you want. Don't laugh at me! Don't you feel too that our happiness could come to an end any moment now? Lucky you. I'm always afraid to wake up without notice. Maybe you're my invention. You are a myth. - Myths always have some basis. Oreste? - Present. I'm sure it'll finish badly. Here we go. I never think of that. Why must you always look gloomy? You want me to be flighty? Nothing can happen to you because I love you like a madman! - Careful! You've got a black nail here. This one has a cut and a bruise. You can't even bend this one. This nail is about to fall. This one is the only one normal. - It's the hand of a worker. I'll never have a son with your name. You'll never be able to marry me. There's a dispensation. That costs millions and millions. Do you have that much? Then, we'll be in a mess. If only I could fall in love with somebody else. Just try, damn! Tasty. That's how Nello Serafini came into my life. With that graceful and gentle gesture. A gesture that simultaneously revealed and concealed Serafini's attitude towards debauchery. Furthermore, we're able to document... Be brief, Counsel. - ...his protesting, subversive, baleful, rowdy character. Wake up! Are you spellbound? - You can't tell me to wake up. If you make any more pizzas that are triangular, I'll break your neck! You're all slaves! - Bigmouth. - I'm no bootlicker. Are you afraid that the boss will cut your wages? You lick, I spit! - Pizza Napoli for Commendatore. - Where's his pizza? You prick! - You're the prick. You only think of your pay. See this wallet? I'll throw it in the oven! I'm sorry but... By now... the storm is brewing... in her heart. I talk to her but she's absent-minded. Her eyes seem to look somewhere else. How can I explain? Such things are impossible to explain. But I tell you that Adelaide... isn't the same woman as before. "What's changed?" you say. These are intangible things. How can I say it? It's like summer is finishing. Yes. The sun doesn't disappear but you can't feel its warmth any more. Got it? You're rolling your eyes? This is serious, Ugo. In short... She no longer loves me. Or it's a passing chill. Or... Perhaps it's me... always demanding more of her. And so, compared to what I used to get from her it seems to be less. I don't know. These are the issues which need to be addressed. Because, you see, I don't mean to repeat myself, Ugo. Adelaide's no longer the woman she was. Romantic and randy, at the same time. When I ask her, she says: "Nothing has changed." What do you say? What do I say? I mean, what do you say? Is Adelaide sincere or not sincere? Either she's sincere or not sincere. You see? You're repeating what I say. Some friend! Either she's sincere or not sincere. So, it was early autumn when Miss Ciafrocchi received the fatal call in Mrs Lalla's wine-shop across the street from her house. Yes. I myself went to call her. It was pouring and I said: Adelaide, go answer the phone and I'll pay the bill. Who is it? - He just said it was urgent. Oh, my! Who is it? It's me. I just called to say I love you like a madman. In such an hour? - I love you in all hours. Tell me you love me more than anything else. Like I love you. Tell me, Adelaide. You're economical. - It's crowded here. - Who's there? Tell me who's there. There's a night watchman and... Three drunkards. - Actually, I'm a conductor. We don't mind, though. So? We won't meet tonight? No, I told you already. I'm letting my sister sleep at my place. Till tomorrow. We'll dine together. I'll pick you up with my Lambretta. Yes, OK. I have to leave you because they're closing now. Got it? Be patient. I think about you. Tell me you think about me. I think about you, yes. But, now... I must go because I'm all soaked. Good night. It was him? What did you tell him? What did you tell him? - What should I have told him? A lie. Master of lies, expert at the deceit and the double-cross A. Ciafrocchi, at the very moment her simple-minded lover hung up the receiver of the public telephone, threw herself into the greedy arms of the man who became her new paramour since that night in the pizzeria. Guilty was the pizza! May Dante forgive me. - Don't listen to him, Your Honor! Six months went by before I saw Adelaide again. In the month of May, I met Oreste at a demonstration against repression and for the triumph of democracy. Damn, what a swelling I got. Hey! You've even lost a shoe. - They were new moccasins. Anyway, there were no rocks to throw. I must admit... I never thought that you, Tuscans, were so close-knit. And I never thought that, among old militants, there was someone willing to take a beating. We're always ugly fish. Wanna comb your hair? Hold this. You got pretty dirty. Wait. Sorry. I'll get you a new one. Never mind. It's rubbish. Do you have a cigarette? Sure I do. When I was a boy, my mom... She'd go crazy trying to do my hair. Where we go? - Where can we go? Dancing? Do you have a girl? My girl's name is Adelaide. A flame. She screams and bites during sex. I've hundreds of girls. Well, a couple. I don't believe in unique and possessive love. I think it's an injustice. What? We want men to be free. We're against one man owning another. So, we're against man owning the woman. Don't you think so? You scamp! You're too young to think clearly. The worker has only one possession in the world: his own woman. Do you want to rob him of that too? It'd be a serious political error worthy of a better cause. Got it? As for me, I'll kill anyone trying to take my woman from me. I'll kill him, I mean it. We think about it differently. And who that "we" might be? We've paved the way for you. That's why we want to upset the apple cart! What? Can't you see that you're kicking up a lot of dust? What do you do for a living? - Pizza maker. - Pizzas are good. I spit on them. - You'd better tell me where you work. Serafini, what exactly did Nardi say to you? "I'll kill anyone trying to take my woman away", he said. I ask that this testimony be stricken from the record as it's not associable to the alleged premeditation on the part of my client. "I'll kill her" is just a modus dicendi. A rhetoric hyperbole, a figure of jargon... - Alright, Counsel. Go on, Serafini. The next week, he introduced me to Adelaide. I didn't even recognize her but she told me: Do you send heart-shaped pizzas to every patron? "Only the most beautiful.", I replied. Then, I remembered. She was that pretty girl I'd seen crying in the pizzeria. Me? Honestly, no one has ever made me cry. Really? Who knows how many men you made cry. In fact, Oreste made her cry. Often, too. That rascal! If I'm a rascal, you are a filthy traitor! Who are you calling a traitor? - You! - Silence, Nardi! I'll kill you! - Judas! Nello Serafini, my best friend. And this baby here is Adelaide Ciafrocchi. Isn't she a beauty? - I like her. Listen. What would you have? An orange drink. And you, honey? - A chewing-gum. Give me the jacket. Dance a little. Come on, don't be shy. Dance! If the lady doesn't mind. - He's a good dancer. I'm dancing. - Come on, dance. I'll be right back. You look like a paralytic. Loosen him up, Adelaide. You send heart-shaped pizzas to every patron? No. Only the most beautiful. Two orange drinks and a chewing gum. I'm here with my girl and my pal. - Who cares? Ever since that day, me, Oreste and Adelaide were always together. 4 months of friendship. From August to Christmas. Stop her! Leave me alone! Why do you pick on me? - You started laughing. You're right. I ask for your forgiveness. Alright. Apology accepted. You accept mine but from now on, nothing more than a "hello"! Adelaide... - Leave me alone! I mean, you... I know why you slapped me in the car. It's because... Because you realized... I'm in love with you. Such horror! Who's there? It's Uncle Umberto. Keep quiet. He's a dirty old man. Who's that over there? - It's me, Nello. What are you doing here? - Nothing. I'm just catching up on sleep. Ow, ow, I can smell a whore. Your sister's a whore. - What a lovely voice! Are you blonde or brunette? Come here! There's no one here! There's no one here? I'll thrash the living daylights out of you. We made love in the backroom of the restaurant where Uncle Umberto works as a watchman. We went to her place until that night, when Oreste phoned. Good. The two did not become lovers right after that night in pizzeria. They became friends and only 6 months later, they found themselves in bed. Substantia non mutat. - Serafini, proceed. After that phone call from Nardi, what happened? You're crying? I fell down the stairs. Why should I be sad? You're here. He's out there, phoning. You love me more than anything. He's mad about me. I love both of you more than myself. What more can I ask for? I'm happy. Aren't you happy? Damn, damn! You've been whining ever since we met. Was I the one to call you? Love can go to hell! - Don't talk nonsense, you cynic! Leave Pinocchio alone. Damn Tuscans! I was cynical. I'm a prick now. You think I don't feel sorry for him, phoning you at night, in the rain? He's the only friend I have. And I wake up crying every night. It's a sign of a great remorse. Lies, deception, ploys... Did you know that, the other day, while making love to him I called him "Nello, my love"? Do you hear that? No. I've got hallucinations. Superposition of faces. There! I look at you, I see Oreste. I look at him, he's got a mustache. No, there's too many of us. We can't go on like this. I can't take it any more. I give up. At work, I can't keep my head on straight. I don't read any more. I'm behind with my English lessons. - You'll make it up. Make it up? I've never been in love before. Then, I fall in love with one man and right after with another. Why two? Two at the same time? I can't live like this. Nello, I loved him so much. Oreste... Oreste, my love, hold me tight! I'm Nello. How could this happen to us? How could it happen? We broke the strict rules of love. Kiss me! Let's forget about him. Don't I get a kiss? - My hair... Come on, play! It's your turn. Did you see, Ugo? Even now, at the phone... I say: I love you in all hours. Tell me you love me too. She says: Yes. I say: You're economical. She says: Well... I say: How about tonight? She says: No. I say: I need to play. Is the story about her sister an excuse? What are you playing jack for? - Yes. A jack. Obviously, you've your own system. - I do. So what? And I gain 9 points. That was your system? Go fuck yourself! Because... - You and your dumb friend! You should've put down the 3. You lost 2 points so as to listen to the story about some tramp cheating on him. Isn't that what you were talking about? I didn't mean it. I heard nothing. The two people I love most. Where is he? Oreste! Where? No, it's nothing. It was... Just a blowfly. But, you see... Everything speaks of him. Our love... is impossible. Listen... I've got an idea. Let's commit suicide. - When? Now? I'm not sure if I could. So... Time to say goodbye. Let's pretend we never loved each other. Although, our hearts will be crying. Go away. Get out! Get out of my life on tiptoe. You are leaving? I'll stay. Go away. Don't turn around. Don't speak, please! The great sorrows are silent. Say goodbye to this house, to these objects... which saw us happy together and which you'll never see again. So long, Adelaide. I've even caught cold. I'm coming. Hi, honey! I'm sorry I'm late. I hope you're not cross with me. Where are we going? - For a pizza. What do you mean? - The pizza. Why pizza, exactly? - You've always liked pizza. I don't feel like eating pizza today. - We'll definitely eat pizza. Hi everyone! No, let's sit over here. Next to Nello. How are you? Hi guys! Welcome! Gar?on! - Coming! Wine, a bottle of mineral water. Quick, because we're Mr Nello's friends. Play something more lively! They were more cheerful when they were poor. More cheerful? Correct. Heard that? You see, ladies, even though we live in affluence now we're much the same people. Old, cheerful Italians. Cheerful and happy. Go ahead. You want a pizza, right? Write down: For this slut here, a pizza napoletana. For this cuckold, nothing! Because I haven't come here to eat but to tell everyone that this vile girl is cheating on me with that dirty traitor, the pizza maker. Yes! Nello Serafini. That guy with the mustache. The boss! Where's the boss? Come here! That guy seduces your customers. He's a disgrace. You managed to tarnish all the best things: love, trust... and friendship. Here! Where're you going? Ashamed, eh? Let everyone know how great your love is. I was about to marry you. But you're just a bitch. That's what you are. A bitch! - You wanted to disgrace me? So be it! Yes. I loved Nello Serafini and I belong to him! Yes, I cheated on him but I don't regret it! I don't feel ashamed! I'm not defending myself! - You ugly bitch! Let go of her! Don't you dare touch her, you bastard! They called each other all sorts of names. Never saw such a scene, I swear. Be more precise. What exactly did Nardi say? Tramp! My best friend. Companion through thousands of battles and sacrifices. You stabbed me in the back like Judas Iscariot! And she destroyed me. I left my home because of her. I left two grown children and a wife. What was Miss Ciafrocchi's answer? - Pig! I gave my best. But everything comes to an end. Love, too. It's over now. It's over! That wife of yours is a wreck. She's a beast. She even sent me to hospital. To the trauma ward. In turn, what was Serafini's answer? You orangutan! You're lucky I'm in control. What stab? Judas, who? She rejected you. I'll tear that octopus to pieces! Let go! He even turned me away from faith. Ask my sister. You steal your sister's job. Want me to tell you what her sister does? Shut up! You're not fit to mention her name. The two people I love most.... Instead, I had two slobs behind my back! Blood must follow its own course. - You hear that? Let go of me! Let me go! Take it easy. I'm on drugs. Half a tube of Sulfamine and a liter of coffee. Alright. Kill me. I don't love you any more. I sure will! Help! Help! He wants to kill me! Habitual hooker. That's your name. You were lucky this time. This is what bothers me: can a nervous system still be in love with the one who beat it up? I'm alluding to Oreste. In the light of day, I hate him. I swear never to see him but I deceive myself. Let me explain. The second one, Nello, satisfies me both emotionally and sexually. Then, the memory of Oreste gets the better of me and I long for the one who beat me up in a nightmare which doesn't let me sleep. Shall I talk about my childhood? - Please do. I wet my bed till I was 3 then no more. I've always had simple tastes: Pasta, stewed potatoes, seafood, dried fruit... - Let the food go. Recurrent dreams? I always dream that I get undressed on top of a cliff. Sign of insecurity. - Leave it to me. What shall I talk about? - Whatever you want. Talk! I was 25 when I had my first complete experience. Then came my great love: Oreste. He's an Aries with a Scorpio ascendant. All that is irrelevant. Let the horoscope go. - I knew it. I read a bit of everything: comics and I'm studying English. Talk! Talk to each other in a loud voice. Group therapy. Talk Cerioni. I am talking. - As I was saying... When I was in love with my poor papa, I had stomach ache because of the guilt. Such an agony. I need to get out of this impasse. Out of this mental disorder. Doctor? Keep on talking. Yes, I was saying... What is the nature of my illness? Was it a trauma? Am I in shock? Is it a neuro-vegetative disorder or it's because I'm a slut? - Let the scientific terms go. Your problem stems from the fact that you consider your case as unique and desperate. By loving two men you're low average. Take your mind off things. Don't think so obsessively about that Nello and Ernesto. Come back Thursday. I'll give you some sleeping pills. I'm glad I came to see you. You gave me back my peace of mind. Thank you, doctor. Thanks a lot. It's Adelaide! Adelaide's back. She attempted suicide. How are you today, honey? When there's no more will to live... science is powerless. I've been psychoanalysed by a professor. I tried to kill myself unsuccessfully. I suffered and fretted. Now, my heart's broken in two. Which one shall I take? Which one shall I give up? Easier to chop off an arm or a limb. You, Nello, I like you because you're modern, personal, fresh-looking, not Roman. And as such, you've an ideal in life. Oreste, you've the appeal of a mature man. You're generous, very curly, strong... In short, I like you. But for both of you there's the other side of the coin. You're jealous, worldly... You're prone to fists. Just like your wife. It runs in the family. And you're not too clean. That time, at Frascati, remember? You even made a noise. Too much wine. - You eat and drink too much. You're not so young. More like my lover, you look more like my uncle. I suppose he's your nephew? No, he's got his faults, too. I was just going to tell him. Wait! So, thanks to this loving agonism, instilled in the souls of the two rivals she, for whose description, not even the pen of Zola, D'Annunzio, Nabokov, would be enough the two came to that which we'll call: The infamous night at the Hotel Molise. And who else, if not Adelaide, "includat iniuria verbis" supported the idea and put the seal on it? I do not know. I ask. No, put that way, it makes it seem a bit dirty. She couldn't decide. Talking about it, it turned out that some problems are solved very simply. Two's not always company. Look at Sweden, Denmark... Obviously, we're much less advanced than our bold and erudite witness. You, Nardi. Which one of you three was the promoter of that mixed experiment? I didn't want to play the Swedish game. It was them. Especially him. That dirty bastard! - Silence, Nardi! Yes, alright. You both have to help me or I'll kill myself! Off with your hand. - Off with yours. This is what you call a sex party? - You degenerate! - I paid for the room. You never fork out a penny! - Go on, kill each other. I'll crush you! - Not on your life. I've been humiliated. You subjected me to torture in vain. Why does everyone have to know our business? Enough! Enough! Leave me alone! Get out of my sight! This time I mean it. I can't stand it any more! I gave you the best of myself. We'll try again. This is a respectable place. It is certainly not a brothel! Go! Quick! Put some clothes on! - It was him. My sister. Bye! - See you! Here we go. I have to speak to you. - Yes, I know. Lalla told me you called. What happened? Just listen. If you say "no" this time, don't show your face again. Forget that you've a sister. - If you want a loan, I'm broke. It's about your future. What future? I'm without a future. I'm the prisoner of the past. As for the present... I'm a tree without leaves. You mustn't talk nonsense. Listen to me. There's a customer of mine. Go! Such a gentleman. A widower. God-fearing. Middle-aged. Filthy rich. He's eager to meet you. Immediate marriage proposal. I assure you that he's as good as gold. Such a nice and sympathetic little man. The adult animal is divided as follows. In the rear part we have: rump, speckle, topside, silverside, round, thigh and tail. Loin and fillet are in the middle. Top blade, ribs, fore ribs, plate and chuck. Then, there's the blade roast, bone roast, tenderloin and shank. Let's not forget about the pulp, flank and marrowbone. In front, we have: muzzle, tongue, neck, pork unbelly and brisket. Not everyone knows these things. - The tripe is considered apart. You'll see, he'll come. What are you ringing for? Julius Caesar, the crackers. - No more. Only the bits of pork from last night. I brought you out of the slaughterhouse to be a butler. I made a mistake. It's hopeless! Once a butcher, always a butcher. Now, move, brute! Amleto... Not that way. After all, he's your cousin. I feel a bit sorry. - Good boy. So, what do you do when you realize you've wounded another person? I run away. Come here. Not wounded by a knife. But in the soul. Beside brute objects, there are things which are not to be touched. And the soul is among these things. It's inside but you can't see it. Like the tenderloin? Are you sad, my love? Are you thinking of jumping? Better than staying with me? - You mustn't say that. I'm fine here. What are all these poles? - It's a precise geometrical pattern. Just as written on the plan of the house. You're wanted on the phone. Why don't you address her Ma'am? You could've brought the phone here. - What do you think this is? No. I don't want to talk to anyone. You speak. - No problem. Hello, yes? I'd like to speak to Miss Adelaide. A friend. - She's not home. Any message? Just, who am I speaking to? Amleto Di Meo. Listen. It's really some advice. You know what to do? Go to hell! You may go. The same to your mom. Up yours. My God! Is it Oreste? Or is it Nello? And to yours. It's Oreste! If he keeps on calling, it'll be hard for me to forget him. There! Anyway, I'll call you back. Know what? It's getting pretty serious. I've never suffered from dizziness yet I broke my arm. Never argued with anyone. I take it out on the master mason and now I'm jobless. Is she that pretty? Where's all that beauty? With that pointed nose, full of freckles... Just look how much prettier this young lady is. And who did I leave my family for? My friends, job, the Party... All for an undeserving woman. And I'm surprised at you. Yes, my dear Ugo. You had to open my eyes. You should've said: Oreste, what are you doing? That's friendship. You're not a true friend. Anyway, no more of this. I'm paying for a round! There's no one. I'll pay our drinks then. - I've paid already. Let's go. I don't give a damn. I do now. I feel happy, you know? I finally know what true happiness is. You're crying? - Come on! It's contentedness. It happens now and then. Hats off to them. Some brooms at last. The City decided to give it a clean-up. About time too! ... the same threats with some political advantages. They must know, everyone must know that the working class, the workers, the young people from Rome and Lazio... Bravo, Pietro! Look, that's not Pietro. - He's good all the same. ... here, in Rome. Above all... to you, friends of President Nixon... Hi, Bertocchi. Long time no see. - You're right. Sorry. Can I tell you something? - Now? A love suffering... in some way, could it be related to the class struggle? What are you talking about? I'm trying to attribute to a personal matter of mine a broader, Marxist meaning. So as not to feel alone. I'll talk to the secretary of my branch. I'm alone. Even among all these comrades I feel alone. It's not fair! In a word... Follow my argument. The human suffering results from the supremacy held by the economic class. Since the man who stole Adelaide from me is a rich exploiter of society... - Let me listen. Each time we've gathered here, in this large, majestic Piazza San Giovanni, each time it's been for... important moments in our Party's history, in our country's history and in the history of the masses. And always, when we came here... The issue which needs to be addressed is this: if Amleto Di Meo was on my level, would she have left me? My answer is: No. What's your political opinion? Are you alright? No, I don't feel alright. I don't feel alright at all. Do I talk nonsense? Listen to what Pietro's saying. We'll talk about it again. I think we've lost him. I recall we were working when we heard a scream coming from the toilet. It was Nello. He swallowed all the rat poison cans. "I want to die!", he said and kept on kicking. We grabbed him and off to the hospital. Adelaide's back! - Let me pass. Let me pass! You've been disfigured! Nothing. I'm looking for a young man who committed suicide. That love of yours... Chin up! Who is it? Ow, ow, I can smell... - It's me, okay! Poor thing! Will he pull through, nurse? - He will but I'm a pizza maker. No, I want to die! Call the top clinician! No, why did you do it? Nello, my dearest... You did it for me, right? - Never! I don't believe you! It's a white lie. With this gesture, you proved to me that you love me more than anyone else! And I abandoned you... Nello, please, forgive me! Tell me you forgive me. You forgive me, right? Hog! He's right. I deserve it. Don't leave me, don't leave me... Is he dead? - What? He's alive and we'll live together. I'll dedicate my life to you. Only if you swear on the Madonna. - I swear! Hold this, nurse. - He'll be OK. - Cuboni Street, 10. There's a man waiting for me. Tell him I'm thankful for the material happiness he gave me but I can't be his any more. Hold this. What's she doing? - Getting rid of all the wealth and returning to me. - What a rotten deal! This one! And this one too. No, it's from my first communion. Then came the autumn. The price of roses was prohibitive. The first chrysanthemums were coming out. The love affair with Nello was going along normally. So much that we talked about marriage. I succeeded in forgetting Amleto Di Meo. As for you, Oreste... I was determined to tear you out of my heart. This is when I presented her to my family. 100 portions of rice croquettes. 25 bottles of champagne. I also developed some slides. Take a look. Right there, on your left. If only you'd seen how happy she was. With my aunt, my mother, Uncle Ambrogio, my sister, Aunt Enrichetta... - And that's me. She was sitting right there where you are. You won't eat? Only after a woman has left you you realize how much you miss her. Right, sir? She even taught me English. What a lovely day today which means "Good day". I know. She was the turning point in my life. I'd give 7-8 million to have her back. Do you smoke? The light! - Just a second! Here's the light. I've a letter from Adelaide. She sent it. Shall I read it to you? Julius Caesar, read it! "Dear buffalo..." - Stop joking! "Dear Amleto..." - Go! "What is love? It's running towards the sun until it goes down and you find yourself in the shade. I am shining upon... the man who loved me the most and he proved that to me by trying to take his life. I must leave you. These stains..." These stains on the paper are tears. - "...tears that stream down my face. Goodbye forever. My dearest Amleto, faithfully... yours, Adelaide Ciafrocchi." That'll be enough. Come here. Here, she's looking at me through a marrowbone. No more slides. We should see each other often. We'll look at the pictures and talk about her. Okay? How about Thursdays? It must become a regular meeting. Did you give him the steak? Goodbye, sir. Till Thursday. Sir! Do you like the tail? Next Thursday, I'll buy a nice tail for you. Alright? I remember his departure down the same street where I often strolled with Adelaide. It was Thursday, October 19. He didn't come on Thursday nor the next Thursday. The next Thursday either. Nor the next Thursday. The next one either. Nor the next Thursday. The next one either. - Di Meo, we understand. I thought I was to say all the Thursdays up to now. - No, you don't have to. Better. Maria Graculios, when did you meet Nardi? Maria Graculios, 31, Gypsy. Then, he starts following me. You can bump into some bad people in Rome. There's always some annoying people. "I'll call a cop!", I said, Your Honor. Please, help me! I know you've the power to help people. Help me! The woman I loved left me for another man. Read my fortune. Tell me my future, Gypsy. Help me. You're my last hope. What's his tribe? - He's a bum. Cast a spell. Give me back her love. Help me! Here, this is all I own: 1,400 lire and 2 cigarettes. Why did it have to end this way? Among the Gypsies... Why, Adelaide? Why? - A pity. Lovers who never loved can never forgive. I loved you like a madman. And you left me... Why? Adelaide, my dearest... - Poor thing. A spell should be cast so as to make you forget Adelaide. That's her name! Adelaide. But, you know everything. - Yes, everything. Let's make a spell for 40 cents. - What? It costs at least 2,000 coins. But I've nothing more. How about 21 cents? - What do you expect me to get for that? Okay. 31 cents, take it or leave it. Yes, I'm okay with that. Here. Take the money. Open the door! The beautiful person is at the door. I've been waiting for you. My darling, how are you? - Fine. Oreste, I got the breakfast ready. Your favorite one. Take a look. Brown bread, ricotta, white coffee... The breakfast that's most healthy. I'm recommending it to everyone. How warm I feel with you. How cute we are today. - Really? Just a second. Look. I made it. I straightened your hair. Like it? You look so much modern, much younger... Right? I had put some hairspray. Seems like a helmet. It won't last long, though. It's really rebellious. - It'll stay. May I? I feel good. What's this? My unlucky hand. A hammer blow. That was the only unspoiled one! - Indeed. The tooth, too. How did that happen? - I'll have it replaced. How much you suffered! I thought... you loved him. Are you crazy? - That you refused to see me any more. Hush! It's not nice. I'm still yours. You've got to trust me. Yes, I do trust you. Yet... I see a shadow upon your face. By now, the past is buried. Rest assured it's all right now. I love you I love you Only you! The groom's rather cute. - Better than the previous one. The bride! She's a friend of mine. Do you mind? Best wishes, Adelaide! We'd better hurry. The priest's waiting. The bigger the slut, the easier she gets married. That guy... is Oreste. It is! It's him. It's him... He looks terrible. Let's go. I don't want to see him. What are you doing here? Ugo... How you've been? You look much younger. It's Nello. Nello, what are you doing here? How are things? - It's because... The ground is damp. You understand? What about you? I've something for you. Please, don't bother. Is that Adelaide? Jeez! Let me say hi to her. Hi, honey! Where are you going? - Not far. All dressed in white. I haven't seen you for quite a while. I'm working now. I remembered that song of ours just now. Wait! How does the song go? "I see a shadow upon your face..." How are you? - Fine, thanks. Why are you limping? - I fell. Went to the NHS and found I have TB but I'm pretty okay. Maybe we could meet again? During market hours, I work here but, at night, I go to the theater, playing... a magician. I must go now or I'll be late for the matinee. Call me, okay? Why today of all days? Where are they going? Quick, let's go. Drive on. Where are you going? It got flooded. Have you already arrived or not? Won't you tell me anything? Is this how you treat an old friend? I impose my will on the motor. Look into my eyes! No use trying! It won't start unless I want it to. Get out, Adelaide! Don't get mad! Open up! I've something to tell you. Look into my eyes! It won't start unless I want it to. Open up, don't be scared. Take me along, please! Take me along! Don't be scared. I want to go, too. Take me along. Don't leave me here all alone. Don't leave me alone. Open up! Open up, I told you we're friends. Don't leave me here all alone. Don't hurt him! He's your friend. What friend gets married without telling me? I'll kill you, too! Be nice! I ask for your forgiveness. My God! Not the scissors! Look... Look what he's done to me. Yes, because you're a conformist! Both of you! You want to kill me? Don't move, Oreste! We'll take you to the pharmacy. These words were interpreted by my client for what they were: an insulting mockery! It's not true! The whole thing was unintentional. He wanted to kill both of us. He was choking Adelaide. I raised my hand once again but only in self-defence. With my eyes closed, like this. I'm dying... I forgive you. It wasn't me. It was him. You? May someone kill you. What? You grant him pardon and tell me I ought to be killed. You... I love you more. Who is it? It's Adelaide. Not again! What happened? She's dead! So, Nardi, anything more to say? Can I be condemned to death? He got work release! He got work release! ...and mental disturbances, I condemn you to 5 years in prison as well as to 2 years in a psychiatric prison. No, it's not true. Your hair looks fine. And we go well together. To be quite honest, we're better off than before. Yes, we are. If I hadn't killed you that day, we wouldn't be so happy and alone. Would you mind going on this side? I mean, no consideration for the lady. There are such rude people around. Educate yourselves, go to school, learn good manners... Wait! Let's cross. Stop! I'm on the white line! Instead of asking other countries to put on a human face how about changing ours? We've transformed the heart of an historic town into an infernal carousel for Agnelli's cars! Sorry, honey. Catch me! English subtitles by: marooned2, June 2016 Thanks to nikko and beastless. Long live Ettore Scola!
