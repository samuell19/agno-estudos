Now I've got you. Come here. Come on, pudgy, come. Move! Come on over here. Almost ready now. Wait a sec, you. Come back here. Heel! Heel! Stay! You look at me with your clear brown eyes and the world around me turns true blue. Unconditional love and devotion - I am all yours, your mistress, your God for you. All that I see reflected in your eyes shows me your loving soul. To me you are the source of all good, as you have love ready for me always. And what do you want of me? My God, so little. A good word, you are rewarded, delighted, a gentle caress and your eyes give thanks. My dog, so easily, so quickly you are elated. You look at me with your clear brown eyes, those eyes I can trust forever more, for no other eyes in this world can look as yours. Animal Love Beautiful red tomcat, male, 2 years old, fixed, very loving and friendly; circumstances forcing owner to find caring new home. Small male mutt, 10 years old, extremely good-natured, looking for especially loving new home due to mistress' illness. Handsome wire-haired dachshund, male, 5 years old, very loyal, looking for good new home. The decision to acquire a dog must be thought over carefully, it must not be made on a whim. You must be prepared to spend all of your free time with your dog; barely ever coming home during the week and going away on the weekends - is not an option! You have to have regular working hours, so that the dog never has to be alone for more than 8 hours at a time. The dog needs an established and familiar place of his very own in the apartment. The dog must be trained well and have a strong sense of self-confidence in order to endure the daily loneliness, a thing which is against his nature. To build up this self-confidence, the dog needs a great deal of love and affection. Be a good dog and heel. Is that heel? Be a good dog and heel, be good. Be good, no, don't pull. Ok, be a good dog and turn here. Nice and easy, turn here and keep going and heel. Heel for mommy. Nice, yes, good dog, very good. Heel, come, Trixie, heel. What a good girl Trixie is. Commands must be intoned precisely. Commands must be distinguishable from praise and praising tone. Their monosyllabic pithiness e.g. come, sit and stay demand a crisp, clear intonation. Commands are meant seriously, so they should sound that way. 'Please' is not a word in the vocabulary of man-dog communication. Regardless of how polite you are by nature and believe me, I don't find it easy to drop the 'please' either. Reprimands must be delivered sharply. Verbal punishment, be it a reprimand, 'bad' or 'no', must be accentuated sharply, the intonation short and piercing. The dog will learn to distinguish a more serious 'bad dog' from a less serious. Use the words 'bad' and 'no' for this purpose only. Do not include them otherwise in your vocabulary. Heel. Now let's have him sit. - Sit! Sit! Lie down! Sit! Sit, down! This won't do, he has to sit now! Heel! Good dog. Sit, Felix. Now bring the ball here! Socks. Ah-choo, fetch the socks. Come on, look, the socks. And you can give your paw? Super dog. Yours can't even give his paw. Your dog is more natural. Give me back the ball. Mine can do it better. Ah-choo come here, fetch the ball. Shitty weather, damned freezing cold. Got an extra smoke, Erwin? - One sec, I can't do everything at once. Take a piss and give you a smoke, how am I supposed to do both? Ah-choo, heel! Cut it out boy. So three months after I came into the world I was found in a dumpster in the 16th district in Vienna. That's when my great life began, and so here I am now. Hey kitty cat, look over here. Hey you, kitty cat, come here. Be a good cat. Are you hungry? You can't eat that much, you little piggy. Bunny. Little rabbit. Well, would be pretty nice. Hello, Hopsy! Come to papa, come, come. I'll buy it. - How much is it? I don't know what it costs, but I'm gonna buy it anyway. Yes, we'll settle up later on then. My Hopsy will make up for it, come here to daddy. Hello, dear madam, I have a question: Are you an animal lover? Have you got extra schillings for my bunny? So that he can eat? - No, at my age I don't have much money myself. My Hopsy is my one and only. Maybe so, but then you shouldn't carry him around like that. He hasn't got a cage. Then you have to find him one. But they're expensive. - You don't carry him like that. I always carry him with me, he sleeps with me, and he would never... Have you by any chance got a few schillings? 'Cause then maybe I can get a cage. In the want ads maybe I'll find one. Look, he can even make his ear droop. You know, how can you carry that little creature around like that. I've had him for a long time. - Okay, but don't you have a cage then? No, I just can't get the money up, because I'm on the street myself, so it's harder to find something. Come on, you're just making excuses. - But then nobody wanted to help out. No way, for heaven's sake. Have you got a few schillings? That'd be so nice! This is how we can get up a little cash. Hello. Hey, I have a question. Would you have a few extra schillings for my bunny? - What? - A few schillings for my rabbit. That would be cool. Yeah, look, here you go. A few schillings, yeah that's great. Thanks a lot, God bless you. Goodbye. Oh, there's a nice lady. Excuse me, I have a question: Are you an animal lover? Not an animal lover. That was a fur-wearer. Excuse me, have you got a few extra schillings for my rabbit? Oh well, my English isn't exactly what it used to be. But you speak English. No, I don't speak English. But why don't you ask her, ask her whether she's an animal lover. Why don't you ask her why she doesn't like little animals. I don't know why. She likes wearing fur, probably. Fur-wearer. Just try asking why she doesn't like animals in general. Now the gas bill is still not paid, the electric bill is still not paid, the rent's that I've gotta pay isn't paid yet. The telephone bill... We can get an extension on that. Who's going to sign for it? - You. Why should I do everything? And we have to buy groceries. - What do we have to buy? Groceries. And I need a... - What do you need? - A flea collar for the dog. - Let him scratch himself. - I also have to take him for his shots. That makes a thousand... are you nuts, 1000 schillings for the vet? I have to budget this out. - Yeah, budget it out. But it costs 1000 schillings. You know. - Well, but we need it. And if the refrigerator is empty, that'll suck too. What about that one over there? Looks nice. Yeah, pretty, but too big. I don't know if that'll fit. Look, maybe it's like that. No, it's the same size. I can't do anything. No. I can't do anything without measuring it. Maybe that one. - There are spots on it. But we can clean them off! I don't think that'll work. Heel, good dog. What do you think of that one? - I don't know. All flattened out. No way, you can still do something with that. Yeah, okay, if you think so. Let's keep looking. Let's look around some more. I think I'd like that one, but I don't know... We already discussed that one. Already discussed it? That would be for the dog... Yeah sure, because it's all ripped up anyway. Look there, what's that? You could fix that. - No way. You'd have to re-cover it, it wouldn't be worth it at all. You just walk right past, look at all there is left to see. Ink stains, that's no good either. You can clean it. You can clean it! All that work! What do you mean, work? Look, that one wouldn't be bad either, we can put the other piece on it. Yeah, I'd like that one pretty well. Come on, look at the dust clouds. Doesn't matter, we can get all the dust off. But it's a great couch. You're right. - I'll just sit down for a sec. Does it have a linen drawer? Just sit down for a minute. Come on up, Benjamin. Ick, look at all the dust. - We can get that off. Benjamin, come on up. When I think about my old lady Christine, who I still desire, I would be glad if I still had her now. I remember lying on the carpet with her, it was cool. My first love. The first male defloration, despite the slap, which I got... How did she manage that? I don't know, she, I really wanted her at the time, but then she slapped me in the face, because I said: Beautiful woman, you've gotta love a beautiful woman. She replied, no, not always. She slapped me in the face because I used this indecent word - cunt. She didn't like that, she said that's how you talk to a whore. And I told her that I had originally planned to go to a whore, but then I thought it would be better to do it the right way at the beginning. And then we found out that we had common interests like music, electronic devices. That's why it didn't work out. It didn't work out but the heart gets hung up in one place, and tends to stay there. And I like this woman, robust, stable, stubborn, everything a woman should be. Of course she can't cook. I realized that when I saw her making scrambled eggs. Because they turned out black, although they were intended to be yellowish. They were black. Afterwards she had to go to work and kicked me out. So where does it get me? Nowhere, but it would be worth a try to continue fucking where you left off. My opinion is, if you fuck, you should do it all the way. Not just halfway. That's useless. You didn't even get that far. - Oh yeah. I got slapped in the face because I said she had a nice cunt. She screamed. I thought I hurt her. Actually the problem was that she had her orgasm while I was holding it back, because these fuckers had told me it's better to hold it back till you satisfy her. Bullshit. She had her orgasm, I had my slap. And in the end she even popped a pimple and asked whether it hurt. No, I said. She let me sleep on the couch and she went to bed. Two months later I paid for her carpet because it'd gotten dirty. Good boys, come here, come here my darlings! These are all welfare cases which I saved mainly from the south. This is Lakis. He's five, from Corfu. This is Lisa, she's one, she's also from Corfu. This is Hubsi, Hubsi is two and she's from the train station in Vienna-Floridsdorf. This is our snow white and our old lady, she's 10, from Corfu. This is Nora. Leave my shoes alone! Come here, Nora, let us have a look at you! She's 4 years old, from a farm in the Burgenland. Yes, you're beautiful, Nora. Leave my shoes alone! This is Romero, he's 10, he's from Corfu. This is Senta, she's 8, from Greece, Corfu. Then Shila. Let us have a look at you, Shila, come here! This is Shila, she's 3. And she's also from Corfu. Who else? Alexia, come on, let us have a look at you. Alexia is eight and we found her during a trip to Greece, on the camp ground. The last one - Wutzibear, come here. Don't be so grumpy! He's the oldest in this group and he's the chief. He leads the pack. Why give the dog a bone, that's stupid. Why is that stupid? Because it's stupid, just take it away. Why should I? If I say take it away then do it! Nonsense, why should I take it away? Because I want it. Let the dog eat the bone and then you'll walk him. I want to go down with him now! He won't allow anyone to take away his bone. Try it! Should I try? Okay, but at your own risk. - Of course, at my own risk. Give me the bone! Then try and do it. Give me the bone! Careful - he might snap at you! Give me the bone! Careful - he might rip your pants! He's really snapping. Be careful what you're doing, be careful, it's dangerous now! Call him! Benjamin, come, let's go for a walk! What's the matter? Lie down, sit! Come, Benjamin, go for a walk! He doesn't obey at all anymore, but we have to discipline him. Benjamin, come here! Excuse me. Would you have a few schillings for my rabbit? Excuse me? - Would you have change for my rabbit? What do you want from me? - Change, for my rabbit. I don't have any change. Excuse me? A few schillings for my rabbit. I didn't understand, what do you want? You have a few schillings for a rabbit? Let's have a look at your rabbit. What? What do you want? A few schillings for my rabbit. A few schillings for the rabbit? I think I have only 5. Doesn't matter, that'll help too. Thank you. This is a female. She's going to have babies soon. Good girl. Like father like daughter. If I had money I'd buy you. She's going to have baby rabbits, they'll be for free. Bye, thanks. I'll give you my address, will you give me one? I'm around here pretty often. You got a few schillings for my rabbit? No speak German? Sure you know German. No German? Czech? Pity. You've got a few schillings for my rabbit? That would be nice. What difference will a few schillings make? I don't know. Whatever you wanna give. Very nice of you, thanks. Have you met my friend? He's got a friend too. And he would like a few schillings too? I don't have any more change. But maybe the lady has a few schillings. What you're doing here is illegal, you know that, don't you? Yes, I know. So then... Then get out of here! Then I won't have anything to eat. - I don't care. What you're doing here is illegal. We know, but we've gotta live on something. Yes, but not here. You know that you're not allowed to hang around here. I don't even know who you are with your green uniform. I think you've got to explain who you are then. I'm the stationmaster. You're the stationmaster, whose? The authorities'... Yes, that's it. Stationmaster. You know that fencing, soliciting and so on is prohibited. Let's say it's not allowed. No, it's prohibited! You're always insisting on your rights. Go and study the laws so you know what you're allowed to do and what not. Look, in my situation, in our situation, isn't it better I go begging and fencing, as you say, than hitting an old lady over the head? Yes, I understand. I mean we can't get a job so we can't work. Who says that, who says so? Look, we've been searching long enough. And you've got to live on something. Zach company looking for young consulting and sales managers. International shoe and leather conditioner saleswoman or person with business background and pleasant telephone voice, part time, re-entry possible after... - Forget it. Ice-cream vendor... Bullshit, damn work, forget it. ...with a branch in Vienna area? Nothing. Looking for plumbers and helpers... That's bullshit, that's no good. Of course we need rules and regulations in a social system, but we don't need that many rules, we need less rules, because with all those rules we end up being ruled. And then we can hit the road. Especially in the private sphere. In shaping our lives. If we have rules for that too, we can totally hide behind all those rules. Because as long as I don't harm anyone else, I reject all regulations, because then I can do whatever I want. That's the way it is with regulations, they're not for me. Because there's a kind of intellectual freedom which is constantly restricted by regulations. That's it, understand? I know that. And sit! And paw! How to seduce a woman: It says: If your partner has sensitive breasts, you should lick and suck and kiss her nipples passionately. I can do that. You will derive as much pleasure from this as she does. I hope so. I know that, I read that somewhere else too. Run your lips all over her body, kiss her softly until you reach her labia. That doesn't take me very long. When you get to the clitoris... Strange language... That's the cunt in German. - The beaver. ...softly with your tongue. That will give her unbelievable pleasure. Then maybe she will have her first orgasm. Ah-choo! Your mommy is going to steal a kiss from you. Good girl, mommy gets a kiss. A kiss on your cute little ears. Justin gives me a kiss, yes, of course. Beautiful dog. We are a loving, attractive couple, ages 25 and 30. Flexible, lingerie-loving, looking for another nice couple between 18 and 35 for lust-filled partner-switching games, especially gentle cuddling, French style, and picture-taking. An immediate partner-switch as well as lasting friendship are also possible, given solid mutual understanding. Flexible single women also welcome to join. Of course, no perversion. Come here you. Good boy. Mommy's going beddy-bye, good night, doggy. Let's go beddy-bye. My daddy's here, it's daddy. You rascal. My little rascal. Good little doggy. I believe that the most beautiful way to show your love lies not in any kind of eloquent declaration with flowers, but in a simple kiss. You desire and you are desired without wasting a single word. And it is precisely this sort of silent affection that many stories revolve around. Just think for a moment about your very first kiss. It was beautiful, wasn't it? - I wrote about it: Yes. That was so romantic back then. Well of course it's a beautiful thing. And yet another thing leads to kissing. Love. What a cutie you are. Well, with politics... When they go too far, and when control gets too tight, it can easily happen that neurotic symptoms begin to appear in certain parts of society. Because everyone's so trapped and thus loses his freedom, the neurosis is natural because there's always someone standing behind you, someone standing next to you, someone standing under you, and with time you get nervous. A district council head, a district chairman, we have a party secretary, and we have yet another secretary, a social affairs department, another department, and gradually you start to get claustrophobic because you have no room to grow as an individual, because someone from some department, some authority is standing there and says stop, stop, smack. You start to go out of your mind because of that. Because you can't grow as an individual, not at all. Someone standing on your left, on your right, and you are sitting in the middle. The party says, he says... You should be reported! Where's the dog's muzzle? Let go now, Benjamin, let go! Make him let go! Get the police! Let go, Benjamin, let go! My dog's bleeding! Call the police! Cut it out, Benjamin! As far as I'm concerned, I mean, I understand that there have to be police, but do they have to be such old-fashioned troopers... Does there have to be such an old-fashioned police force in Austria? That's no police department, that's a nickel and dime, it's completely trivial. I think there should be some kind of kangaroo court with fines for little misdemeanors so they can concentrate on real crime, it's totally insane. All the police detectives are overloaded with parking violators and shoplifters and the important cases go uninvestigated. Of course, because they're idiots. It's so insane. They're far more concerned when someone steals a bottle of beer than when someone pulls a machine gun. It's all a really big screw-up. Besides, we have an old-fashioned system, we need academics, police academics and not those red-neck slobs. The way it is these days, with organized crime and all, those slobs can't catch anyone anymore, maybe they used to catch them 40 years ago but now it's no longer possible. What's wrong with you? Okay then, go home! Go home, let's go! Go on! Go home! Now be nice and heel! And now sit! Such a good dog. And heel! He can heel. Come on, Niko, heel boy, even if it's tough. Heel! Pulled a muscle, got hit with something, I don't know. Her rear end is completely busted. She's got something wrong with her hind legs. What shithead did that? - Only Peter and my father were here. Go on, walk a little, honey! She can't. She's dragging her rear end. And the only ones here were my father and Peter and otherwise there was nobody home. Him? I'd believe it. What did he do with the cats, can you remember? When they were sitting up there and he threw them down? Or when the ferret was lying in bed and wanted to get to the kitty bowl... Does he have a key? Of course, the other key to the apartment. Oh, that one? Look, I really can't keep her anymore, because I don't want her to suffer, but that really sucks. I love animals, but whoever hurts the little tiger... Other than dad there was nobody here. - Is my enemy. No one else could have done it. The big dog is harmless. But what did you do last time, you were so drunk, you took that thing and gave each of the cats a smack with it? Because they were all over the food. You can't do that, you can't expect a five-month-old cat not to jump up onto the windowsill or onto the sink. But the plants I bought? I explain it to you, it's like saying to a baby: Now you stay put right there for three hours. I'm glad that I never had kids, that's why I have animals. But I'm not so happy with them either. I like a dog that leaves you alone, a cat if it leaves you alone, or a chick if she keeps her mouth shut! Do I have to put up with you yelling at me? Little fucking ferret here, I like it! You horse, you'd be glad to give me two and I'll keep two nostrils? What are we going to do with the little creature? I'll have to take it to the vet. And who's going to spring for that? I'm going to pay for it, you want to let the thing die? I'm not paying for it, they're your animals, after all. I mean I'll pay for the vet. I know, I won't help you out. But I'll get the money from my father. Because he was the only one here. And he'll give it to me... Why does he have the key? He never gave it back to me. I went down to the store and he said he'd stay here. Now I know where my liquor is, my beer and my wine too. And my cigarettes too. Shut your mouth for a sec! Now I know where it all disappears to. I come home and my coffee's gone, my wine's gone... - Wait, do I drink coffee? I know you don't drink coffee. But he sure does drink, like a fish. Should I lie to you or not? Have I ever lied to you, yes or no? All right then, then you should hear the truth. I like you, I don't like her. She's an old dog, she's 38 years old, what am I doing with such an old hag? It doesn't matter to me, but I have clean laundry, I have my cigarettes, I have my pocket money, don't even need to take the dog outside like you do, I have my Marlboros, my vodka, my coffee, my meals on time, and I can invite friends over. And there's enough space. What's here for me? Yeah but you still can't convince me that you only live with the old hag because you have food and cigarettes, I mean, if I had an old man and I were together with him, then I'd be with him because I like him, not because he gives me cigarettes, and because I have space and money, I mean, that's completely uncool. I like you, you know that. Then what are you doing with the lady? I ask myself the same thing. Normally I should be with you, but look: Now I come home at six or seven, I get my schnitzel. I have it hot on the table. What do I get with you? Shit, over and over. There's a way I'm coming back to you, but you have to get rid of the animals. I don't get it. I have a German Shepherd there, it's five years old, a female, I don't even know she's around. But didn't I just say that the two dogs have to go? Do you like me at all anymore? That's how it starts, you know. I mean, what am I supposed to say, when you call me every morning I have to come pick you up from the barroom, I mean, I just can't take that. I wanted to build a life together with you, but it didn't work. With your shithead friends, five thousand one hundred schillings phone-bill, I have 550... Did you have to pay? I don't pay a thing! What for? But I would have kicked in, because I am fair. You started with all that, kiss my ass. That on top of it all, I'm getting hot already. Well... It's enough for me... No more for me today, thank God. I too have my bottle of vodka at home, I drink it there. Even if I do get shit-faced and dragged into the sack. I need a warm brew like that too. You're not even in any condition to get up and pour yourself some liquor! Because they've already gone to your head. Should I get some liquor? Well, you're an idiot if you don't. Poison my body a bit? Don't want to end up in jail, I'll piss on the queer boys. I'm 45. I was looking for my peace. I thought I would find it with you but you're screwing things up. Why am I screwing up? Should I let you keep me like a pet or something? I don't keep you like a pet. I know exactly what would come of it if you came back to me. I'd never be allowed to go out again. I don't even want to come back to you, you're kissing my ass! I'm kissing your ass! - Yeah sure. If you think I want to fuck you, I'll fuck you long and hard. Of course. Because I like you so much? That's not cool at all. Did I screw up? No, you're the innocent one. Maybe it's my fault, but your fault is bigger anyway. Do I have to take these threats from such a little shit? Do I have to take these threats? - From who? From you? Now you're starting up with that shit again, listen, fuck off. You'll never see me again. I want my peace and quiet, you hear, I don't need that, I don't need these lousy creatures. It's friggin' disgusting. You belong to Robert too. She belongs to Robert with her stinking cunt that I love to lick so much. And Zoran belongs to Robert too. And kiss my ass. We have come together today to say good-bye to you, beloved Lady. I'd like to welcome you here, dear fellow mourners. And I consider it a special honor to be the one to say good-bye to you. My dear, beloved Lady, you were our little girl, brave and dutiful, full of love and loyalty. I would like to give you a couple of lines to take with you on your final journey - words which seem especially appropriate for a little dog like you. And thus God spoke to the dog: You have to take care of this Man. I have given him reason, but I see that it leaves him from time to time. You can smell the evil, he can't. You can warn him when there is danger. Because it reaches your nose and ear ten times earlier than his. You must forgive him when he is impatient and unjust. You must remember that he is human. You must show him what love and loyalty is, repeatedly. Dear fellow mourners, I ask you to say good-bye to our beloved Lady now. Then our darling will go to the crematorium and in her urn she will then be assigned a beautiful place at your home. And don't forget, dead are only those who are forgotten, and we will never forget our Lady. Yes, good boy. What's your papa going to do now, what's he going to do without you? Will he be sitting in a café again, gambling, no-one will be scolding him, he will drink a lot. Yes, of course. They were all scoundrels, weren't they? One was gambling, the other one couldn't pass up a single skirt, one went around breaking into houses, he was really a bad one, the other was drinking. All bad boys, aren't they? Yes, you've got to get used to it first. Your mistress won't be back. She gave you away, swapped you for two kittens. Swapped you for two kittens, honey. But we're going to make it. Even without your mistress. We don't need any kittens. You're our little boy, right? Sometime she'll be standing on the doorstep, but then it will be too late. Then we won't let her in anymore. She left us after 7 years. My only boy. We'll make it without her. We'll find another mommy, won't we? Another mommy, and she'll love us, right? Yes, my darling, you're back at your mommy's. It wasn't that nice with your papa, yeah? Mommy has much more time for you. Cooks delicious food, the way you like it, daddy couldn't do all that. Mommy has much more time for you. We can go out a lot, go beddy-bye, go sleep together. Beddy-bye, we'll play together... You were alone a lot when you were with your daddy. You had to stay with strangers all the time, like a little orphan. And now it's just the two of us, just you and me. What a good boy. Yes, very good boy. My sweetie. Yes, you're my little sweetie pie. Beddy-bye. Go beddy-bye. We don't need no daddy, do we? No, we don't need no daddy, just the two of us. Maybe mommy is going to buy you a puggy-girl, a second one, yes. So that at least my little boy has his little girl. Mama doesn't have no papa. You wanna have a little girl, wanna have a little wife? Then we'll have little babies, little mopsi babies, lots of little puggy babies, I'll have a puggy family then, won't I? Doesn't matter, don't need any children then. Heel! Let's go! Now! What is it? Hey! What is it? Let go, let go! Let's go! Your daddy has left with his suitcase. Has taken the bar with him. Didn't leave a penny, not a thing, for my Charlie, but it doesn't matter, I always have something to eat for my Charlie, my Charlie always gets something to eat, something to eat, you'll always get something, your mommy will walk you then, we'll go for walks together, yeah? Your daddy has left. Asshole. I hope he kicks the bucket, don't you? He should be hung from the highest tree. But you won't go back there, to your daddy. If you go to your daddy I'll beat you. He's not your master anymore. I'm your mistress, that's all there is to it. All these men are a load of shit. Your master. The 11 years were good, don't you think? But that doesn't matter now. Didn't come home Sunday night. Didn't come home. And his suits, he picked up his suits. With Helga. That whore. Tuesday the 14th. Came and got the bar, TV, radio. Didn't come home. That was the last day I saw him. Wednesday, Thursday he didn't come. Friday he got his shoes and tapes, end of story. Your master, but that won't bring him any luck, I hope he kicks the bucket with his brains all bashed out. Charlie, it doesn't matter, does it? We're already used to this, being alone. It's been 14 days already. 14 days your mistress has been alone with you, without your master. I hope he kicks the bucket with his brains all bashed out. Kisses. No, I don't want to give you away. No, you're mine now and I want to have you here. I want to have you here, you're all mine. You're my boy. My honey pie. All mine. What's it? What do you want? Put it back! Immediately! Once again and you'll be in trouble. I tell you. Yeah, just look at me. Don't cry over love lost, my darling, nothing but a waste of tears, don't cry over love lost, my darling, 'cause tomorrow the sun will laugh again. Don't cry over love lost, my darling, nothing but a waste of tears, don't cry over love lost, my darling, 'cause tomorrow the sun will laugh again. I gain strength from your charm and your love. You make me happy. Your body is a gift from the gods. It excites me over and over. It's the most beautiful thing in this world to be loved by you. Words all fail to describe the feeling that I feel when you touch me, when we become one, when the desire that drives us both is finally quenched. I love you. Listen to that! My dearest. I love your hair, your nose, your mouth, your eyes, your bum, your legs, and above all, those thighs. I am so addicted to your triangle of Venus, your breasts, the most beautiful in the world to me. I can't even wait anymore to be able to touch and kiss all of those places. I say goodbye with kisses upon kisses. Your loving lover. My beloved dearest. I love you more than anything. My dearest. Please come back to me. By God, I want to and will caress you ever more, I will love you more than anything, more than anything again. The way I love you and have loved you, I will never again, never ever again be able to kiss a woman in my life. This I swear to you. What did you say? Do you also swear... I love you. It is you I love. My dear, only you. Love you truly, dear. I truly do love you. What would you say if I came in here and told you I'd had an affair with another man. Would you be jealous? Since when? I've already told you: Honesty is everything, because for me it is no different, because whenever I get the opportunity, whenever the opportunity arises, I jump on it, because I'm just a man after all. And you don't eat schnitzel every day either. With time that gets boring too. But at the very most I would ask you if you enjoyed it. Then it could easily happen that I go into detail and tell you what it was like. That's always nice. When you tell me about it. You mean so that you could picture the scene and maybe get off on it yourself? Yes, exactly, that's it. But first it's off the bathtub with you. We don't need the other woman's smell. - No, not necessarily, just like you don't need the other man's. - No, I don't exactly need that. - Of course. At least not hours later. Yes, right. So first a bath, then cuddling and telling about it. - No, that's no good. No? No, because you don't get dressed after bathing. And completely naked... - How do you know? Maybe I do put something on now and then. Come here you, you naughty little dog, come here to me. Yeah, I know, I love you so much. Say something, you used to talk to me so nicely before, you used to answer me. Come on, say something. Tell me, do you still love me? Say something, please. Look at me. You'll see, now things are going to improve, now we'll go out. Honey, I can't help that I was gone for so long. If only you were angry at me. You angry? Come on, look at me. Look at me and tell me something, you used to talk so nicely before. Look at me and say something. Say something to me. One word. Say one word for mommy. What do you want, boy? Please, say one word for mommy. Say "poor mommy," like before, then I'll know that you still love your mommy, come on. Hello, this is hot and horny Bettina.

Don't stop, go on. And heel! Good boy. Mother nature, that's a very broad concept. Nature is actually everything. The things we stand on, walk on, breathe, see, smell, hear, everything but man-made objects; I don't think this is right. We destroy nature with our own hands; at some point nature will take revenge and then we humans will be the losers. The animals will be the ones to survive. Not us. We say we're the crowning touch to creation, but what are we really? Nothing. We're no better than the chimpanzee in the jungle, the hyaena in the Savannah or the deer, stag and hare in the forest. Whatever. We extinguish our own living space. With our so called borders, our so called morality. In our arrogance we call the animals way of living immoral. Actually they have a higher moral code than we humans. This is my wife Rosa with 3 of our 4 Afghan hounds: Monique, Tasha and Quantos, in our living room, lovingly decorated by my wife. Now let's proceed to one of my hobbies - in quotation marks - the bar. Because here I can relax a little bit. From the first floor we proceed up a spiral staircase to the second. The dogs don't have any problems with the stairs because they know it since they were little. You must have noticed a couple of trophies, the dogs won them. Here on the second floor we have my office, bedroom, bathroom. We're now entering the garden. As you can see it's a wonderful life here. Lush greenery. We really like it up here. And now we get to the garage. Here you see our fourth Afghan hound doing his workout because like any greyhound he needs to run at least 10 km a day. Give it to me, give me the dog. No! He's mine! No, this is mine! Stay here! Stay here with your papa! Don't bite! Be a good boy! Don't bite! No, he doesn't bite. Good dog! Yes, you're mine, yes you're all mine! What is it, what? Come here, sit, come! Come here, he almost fell now! You almost fell! I got you back now! What's the matter? What is it, you? You're a bad boy, yes, bad bad boy! What is it? Yes, come here. Now I got you. He keeps running away from me! Yes, he really does. He's running away from me! - Yes, he really is. And yours? He's still here. He's running away from me! He's running away from me!
