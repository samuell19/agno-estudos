This story is entirely true... ..as I have imagined it... ..from beginning to end. Yep! Yep! OK! There are many people here today in front of the Government Palace. ..waiting for the arrival of the president Marc Jary. It's in an atmosphere of celebration in the middle of an enthousiactic crowd... ..that the presidential motorcade will soon appear on Victoria Blvd. President Jary will go to the Congress Hall to be sworn in, making him for the second time and for the next six years, the most important figure of the state. Recall that on April 23rd... ..Marc Jary learned that he has been elected for the second time. He defeats his opponent by only 300,000 votes. Broadcast monitor. Briefly, please. Mr. President,... ..which political line will you adopt for next six years? You see, Bernard Shaw said... "There are people that are seeing things as they are... ..and are wondering "why?"... ..and there are people that are dreaming at things as they never were... ..and they are wondering "why not?" l will try to be among the second category. Move! Move! Listen Jary was shot. No, impossible to approach... ..they put him in an ambulance. Up there, on the terrace! I saw him shooting! I'm telling you, I saw him. - To all sections - Building 244B 244B The sniper is there! Block all the exits! Clear the stairs Press communique. By presidential decree, an inquiry committee... ..was designated to establish a detailed independent report... ..about the circumstances that led to the death of the president Marc Jary. The committee is directed by... ..Frederick Heiniger, President of the Supreme Court... ..and composed by Mr. Hugues Adler,... ..the Secret Services Director,... ..Mr. Robert Picart, Secretary of Justice,... ..Mr. Albert Philippe, Senator... ..General Anthony Baryn. the Secretary of Defense,... ..and Mr. Henri Volney, Attorney General. The inquiry. lasting over an year, has now come to its end. 20,000 testimonies, 30 annexed volumes... ..evidence, 682 pages... .. Report that will be handed to the chief of state... ..and that will be very soon made public. The report conclusions are: First, President Jary was killed by 3 bullets... ..shot from a semiautomatic rifle Winchester Magnum, Caliber 338. Second, the killer name is Karl Eric Daslow... ..and the murder was premeditated. Third, Daslow was a neuropath, an unstable character and a loner. Fourth, Daslow acted alone. No complicity was proved... ..nor conspiracy were ever established. Fihth, during the arrest, Daslow committed suicide. Signed: Heliniger committee. Thank you. Mrs. Lapierre. Do you agree with these conclusions, gentlemen? Perfectly agreed. As agreed gentlemen, then then we will all sign this document. I'm very sorry, gentlemen... ..but l cannot sign this report. Camera 2, close up on Volney! Camera 2, close up on Volney! Attention please, on air in 20 seconds The photographers are invited... ..to occupy the designated press area! Attention on air in 5 seconds! Good evening. Today at 16:00hr on all the telexes of the world... ..were receiving the most astonishing and unexpected information: A member of the Heiniger committee... ..refused to sign the inquiry conclusions... ..over the circumstances of President Jary's assassination. That man is Attorney General, Henri Volney... ..who is with us tonight in our show "One man, one event" AG Volney. This evening you are the man that made the event. So we will kindly ask you to answer the questions... ..of the 5 members of the committee you took part... ..of the international press representatives here in the studio... ..and everyone in the country who want... ..to participate on this show at any time... ..by calling 7-777-77. Mr. Heiniger. You are the president of the Supreme Court... ..and of the inquiry committee. For this reason l will ask you to start the debate tonight. l would like to ask Attorney Volney a very simple question: For a whole year, you have participated with us... ..in all the different stages of this elaborate and exhaustive inquiry. Yet you never once... ..explicitly expressed your reprobation or a somewhat disagreement. So, why are you doing it today? Mr. President of the Court, This long year that you speak of was precisely the year of the inquiry. I had no reason to against it. Today I am simply in disagrement with the conclusions of this inquiry. Please! Please! I haven't finished! I would like also to ask Mr. Heiniger a question. A very simple one. Please. Very well. Is it true that, along with the inquiry... ..you received a directive from the highest levels... ..and has been summarised as... .."To establish that Daslow was the only shooter"... .."and that there was no conspiracy nor plot?" "I wouldn't take the responsibility of starting a 3rd World War." Did you, yes or no, received this directive? Mr. President of Supreme Court... Please allow me to help you. First, you will answer that nobody received such a directive... and that l have no paper to prove the contrary... ..and all this will turn against me. Second, you will also tell me that I've made up all of these allegations... ..But then, l will show the authentic document that proves the contrary... ..and all of this will turn against you. President Heiniger, would you take this chance? Yes. I received that directive. I mean this suggestion... ..this wish, more exactly. But I swear I didn't follow it. Thank you. So, Mr. Attorney, on one side we have those vilains that signed the report... ..and the other side, you, a brave man of justice, alone against all? No, General. Baryn, no... I must state that all the Heiniger commission members... ..are honest men, serious, advised... ..and of outstanding character... ..conscious of the greatness of their mission. We are flattered. Mr. Attorney. "You are all correct, BUT.." ..But what, Mr. Attorney? What are you blaming this committee of? What I reproach this committee of... ..I'd say, it's a state of mind. We were sincere when we said... "we want the truth and nothing but the truth"... ..but we all really wished that this truth... ..would be different than the one we wished. But, we wished a different one: But a clean one. A comfortable truth, that bothers no one... ..makes no waves, doesn't splash anyone... ..a truth that dispels the rumors. A truth that melts the mysteries... ..and keeps our image intact. What rumours are you talking about? What are we afraid of? I'm afraid to admit that in this country... ..certain political problems can be solved through assassination. This is unacceptable! Mr. President, allow me to recess... ..because of these insults to the country's honor! Sit down, General Baryn! The truth has no honor, nor country it must be accepted as is. Jack Turner. France Press... Mr.Attorney, as I understand, you think Daslow is no longer guilty? Ah, Mr. Turner, you're running much faster than me. After one year of inquiries I'm told today: That Daslow is the assassin of the President Jary. I answer: it's possible. Two: he acted with premeditation. I answer: maybe. Three: I'm assured that Daslow was insane... ..I answer that nothing allows us to state this... ..because l don't find anything in this report to prove his dementia. Then, did he commit the murder being insane... ..or we are declaring him insane because he committed the murder? Four: to says that Daslow lacked the family warmth,... ..that he was emotionally unstable... ..and he wanted to take his place in history with this gesture. Might I add that there are countless like him all over the world... ..that fit those characteristics but they don't shoot presidents. Five: it says that Daslow acted alone. Honestly, I can't tell. Finally, six: Daslow committed suicide. And I answer: Why not! In summary, in front of six allegations, I end up with six doubts. Quiet! Everyone at this time, please! Silence please! They tell me that all the phone lines are blocked. I suggest you to listen a viewer's question. But! Please! Stop calling. Hello. It's your turn. Mr.? Mrs.? I'm like thousands other citizens in this country... ..I very much liked President Jary. Well! I would like to know what will happen now. Mr. Heiniger, would you like to answer? Mrs., Article 4 of the committee charter says... ..that if one of the six members refuses to sign the final report... ..first, the committee is dismissed... ..and second, the one opposing to its conclusions... ..is authorized to start the inquiry from the very beginning. In this case... ..Mrs., this man, is Attorney Henri Volney. Good night. Pierre. "You were I.N.C.R.E.D.I.B.L.E.! Respectfully," Karl-Eric, My Husband The life of Daslow. I think he spent the whole night in the office. What makes you say that? I arrived early this morning and he was shaving. Good morning, gentlemen. Please! Please allow me to say, how much... ..how much I appreciate that you are beside me. Thank you. That's all? Yes, Sir. Yes. These are images caught by the only TV camera... ..on the motorcade route at the moment of the assault. The enthusiastic crowd broke the cable and the camera was disconnected. It took 3-4 min. to restore the connection,... ..and when was it was restored all was done already. The drama took place over the disconnection interval. I see. When the camera started again I recorded a small piece of film. Not much, but lf you want to see it. Of course. At this moment the bar pattern appeared... ..and the assassination was announced That's all. Max! Rreplay the last sequence, please Stop! We must find that man. If his camera was reloaded,... ..he surely captured the phase of the attack on tape. Check all the developing labs... ..and foremost, find the name and address of the amateur filmmaker. Ok. If I understood well,... ..I'm appointed? That's the privilege of age, buddy! We must publish an announcement in all the papers. "We're looking for any amateur movie of the assassination of President Jary." "Please send documents to: Attorney General Henri Volney, P. O. box 405." Add "Reward." "Substantial Reward." No, we don't watch any of the movies, everything is automatic.. The negatives enter on one side... ..and on the other side, kilometers of... ..baptisms, weddings, anniversaries and holiday memories... ..ready to be sent out. The ads in the papers are starting to generate results. We already got 5 films since this morning. We have 8, Super 8mm, 16mm. Four silent films and one with sound. Yes. Bob? Then, all is well. We must continue. 2,800 labs, aren't that much. Here? It's OK. We're living some great moments of cinema. I'll screen the 16mm film. If you are interested in the rest... ..call Mr. Sanio at 8-463-742. We have a master of suspense here. Above all, he has a sense business. Charly! Mr. Sanio? Yes, Robert Sanio. This is Mr. Keler, my attorney. Your Honour. Come in, please. Take a seat. So, Mr. Sanio. How much? After I discussed this with my wife... ..if I give you this film it means that I will lose it for good. Me and my wife are very attached to this film. How much. Mr. Sanio? 200? 2,000. That we would like to be put into the account of Cancer Research. Your unselfishness gives you honour. Of course, you will also give my client, hand to hand, let's say... ..25,000 Mr. Sanio, you are the most expensive filmmaker of the country. Take this to the office 412. They'll settle with you. I would like to add, because I'm an honest man... ..that I've already sold the movie a year ago, right after the event. To whom? I do not recall the company name... But... ..it was never broadcasted anywhere, that you can be sure of. I really watched for it. All right. Here. I made a double. Maybe even in triple. - "It's not the time for filming!" - "Get out of here!" "Lie down. Lie down." "Clear the catwalk." Max, play in reverse. I'll stop you. Good - Stop. Play forward. - "It's not the time for filming!" - "Get out of here!" "Lie down.. Get down." Stop! It's curious. It's curious... Don't you think? The first bullet hits the president in the face... ..but at this exact moment,... ..many peopleare looking in the opposite direction. Maybe somebody shouts at them. That's it! While somebody kills the President in front of them... ..somebody shouts: "Hey, Charly!"... ..and all the people are turning to see who shouted. No. They definitely heard something... ..but certainly not: "Hey. Charly!". Max! Go on! Here Sanio is hustled, but he's still filming. Now playback again the same part. Good. But when I tell you to slow down... ..play it frame by frame. "Clear the overpass" Slow down! Stop! That's him! Those people were looking at him. There's no doubt. Enlarge the image. We must find these seven men and two women. It won't be easy. Max, Charly, you have green light. Vernont. We will go to see the 2nd floor of the building. It's a nice office, you know... ..but unoccupied for over an year. Really unfortunate. The phone isn't working, sir. You can make a call from the hallway. You gentlemen are here to rent this office, right? No, not exactly. Tell me, this office belonged to a company named Transcontinental Import-Export? Yes. But one morning, they just vanished. But, since they paid for 8 months in advance,... ..the owner wasn't so angry. But I think I know what happened. Ah! Ah! You know we are in the building where the President was shot from. No. The Transcontinental people were so good... ..and so very nice people... ..that they didn't want to stay in a building where the President was shot. The proof is that the next day, they were gone. What makes you believe that they were "very nice people"? Before they disappeared they left me an envelope in my locker... ..with som.. s.. ..with a very beautiful gift inside. I'll let you think it over. Hold on! Here. No, you didn't have to. Thank you! I will leave you the key, you can return it to the office. I've called the Business Registry... ..Transcontinental Import-Export does not exist. It's a shadow company. As well as this office, that was rented... ..only for hiding the second sniper. And two snipers already means an organization. So one sniper, Daslow on the terrace... ..and the other here, on the 2nd floor. But the nine witnesses when they turn around... ..it's not the terrace they look at... ..but here, towards the 2nd floor window... ..because the shots were heard from here. Strange though, isn't it? There is nothing about the nine witnesses in the report... ..but instead,... ..a certain Niki Farnese, who was in the crowd... ..shouted pointing to the window were Daslow was... ..I quote "Up there! I saw him shooting! I'm telling you, I saw him!" Thank you for coming, Mr. Farnese. Your colleagues told men that it will only take a few minutes. My wife accepted to take care of our shop. We will try not to misuse your time. Tell me, the day of the assassination... ..you saw a man shooting... ..from this building's terrace? I saw him distinctly. Where were you at that moment? I came here early that morning. Look, I was right there. Beside this red fire hydrant, exactly! Are you absolutely sure? Absolutely! Look, I was sitting like this. A policeman even told me get off the fire hydrant. It seemed stupid to me because I was alone. So I stayed. and from this place, I saw everything. Can you give me your glasses, please? Thank you. Tell me,... ..what do you see on that board over there? It's blurry. I'm shortsighted. But that day, when you shouted "Up there! I saw him shooting!"... ..you were wearing the glasses? Of course. I wear them all the time. This photo was made that day. It's you there, right? Yes it's me. Only, that you didn't wear your glasses. I didn't have them anymore. Ah! There was a terrible hustle, someone pushed me... ..and the glasses fell and they broke. I had to buy another pair. I can give you a copy of the invoice if you want. But when I saw the assassin... ..I was still wearing the glasses, that I'm sure of. Now you see the terrace? - Of course. - No, no. keep looking it! Mr. Farnese. This television vehicle was exactly in this place the day of the murder. So what? I only said that I saw up on the terrace a man with a rifle... ..and when the police went up... ..they found someone with a rifle up there. That proves that I didn't invent anything. So? Nothing, Mr. Farnese. You can go back to your wife and your shop. I am Pierre Gregory, sir... ..and this is Stan, our sniper. You were the one who retrieved Daslow's rifle and shells? Yes, sir. They were like this. These three marks are indicators of the shells' position? You're positive? Absolutely, sir. Without touching anything, one of my colleagues took pictures. I brought it. Good. Good. Let's start. Gregory to Lombart. We are ready. We blocked everything on a 1 km radius. It's all ready. Over. Hum! Gregory, your shells are not as disciplined... ..as Daslow's! Again, please. How do you explain this mystery? Three shells almost perfectly lined up and grouped. I think it's more than a mystery, sir it's a true miracle. Thank you That's all for today. So, those nine witnesses? We've almost completed. Robert Kosheba. Marianne Delilah... ..Charles Polodi, Guillaume Gemenos... ..Nicolas Rosenko. Ramon Kimenez... ..Ursula Hoffmann, Serge Levis... ..and an unknown. Well done! The truth is that we had more luck than we deserved. Almost all of them came to testify on their own accord... ..and asked to be heard by the Heiniger Commission. I didn't read such testimonies in the Heiniger report. ..I would have noticed! Page 198 of the report... .."The commission discarded the testimonies... ..that were proved too imaginative... ..not serious enough or preconceived opinions". That's the reason these statements never got to you. All of them came forward... ..except two of them: Nicolas Rosenko,... ..journalist... ..worked for a weekly scandal tabloid. We found this on the first page of his paper... ..not as an author, but as a actor. Hello? I am speaking as representative of the PLO. Palestine Liberation Organization. About? Listen carefully, I won't repeat... ..We just executed your journalist, Nicolas Rosenko... ..because he is a propaganda agent paid by Israel. You will find his body in your parking, 1st basement, aisle 6. A few hours later, the PLO was positively denying its involvement... ..in Rosenko's killing. The police closed the file. The death of Rosenko is bizarre... ..but doesn't explain why he couldn't come in front of the commission. I think he did not testify... ..because he preferred to work on his own. He was passionate about the Daslow case. I found this under the backseat of his car. Ok, So? "Daslow's autopsy was never done." "Why?" "Daslow kills himself with a gun." "To whom did the gun belong?" "The route of the official motorcade was disclosed... ..until in the last minute." "How did Daslow know it?" He's right! "They already knew each other. Who?" If Rosenko tore off this page. it's because it had a certain importance. Give me your...... Pages 147 and 148. Good... Karl and an Italian friend, Luigi Lacosta. Well, try to find out more about this Lacosta. We see the rest? Ursula Hoffmann. "Recently arrived from Hamburg's seedy harbors and hot streets"... .."she's the sensuality itself"... .."she's the dream, she's the love"... .."in an hallucinating nude show"... .."here comes.... Ursula Hoffmann!" Ursula! Ursula! What are you doing there. for Christ's sake? According the inquiry, she killed herself... ..because of a sentimental deception. Ramon Kimenez. 33 years, artist. Precise as always, at 9.00 the garage keeper is definite... ...like every morning at the same time, he takes out a client's car. In front of the garage, a man offers a light to a pedestrian. It's Ramon Kimenez. Suddenly he's not feeling well, takes a few staggering steps... ..and falls on the sidewalk. An available ambulance on the street stops and picks him up. At that time, it was at most 9:05. Ramon Kimenez is still alive. At 10:30, the hospital registry undeniably proves it... ..the ambulance arrives at the hospital. In the emergency room, it's a dead man that was just brought in. "Heart attack", concludes the intern's report. No autopsy. We have to admit that people die of a simple heart attack. Yes, for sure. But in this affair, there's a hole,... ..an enormous hole of an hour and a quarter. I've checked it all. Even in the case of a traffic jam, it takes 15 minutes... ..to get from the garage where Kimenez collasped... ..to the hospital where he was taken... ..15 small minutes! But this ambulance just happened to be there... ..took over one hour and a half What were the ambulance crew explanations? None!. The ambulance which drove Kimenez belonged to a small company... ..which was immediately taken over by a bigger one. Of course, to cover it up, they "lost" the personnel records. Marianne Delilah... Guillaume Gemenos... Charles Polodi... ..three traffic accidents. Marianne Delilah was an exceptional biker according to her friends. A truck side swiped her without stopping. And the other two? Almost identical cases. both Gemenos and Polodi... ..lost control over their vehicles. The real accident causes were ignored in all the 3 cases. Serge Levis, 23 years old, single... ..was a photo publicity model. You have his file here. Without telling anyone, after he signed a series of contracts... ..he disappears. Found dead 2 months later in a motel. A bullet in the back of the head Robert Kosheba, 28 years old,... ..electronics engineer. On 22nd of September. Kosheba, a regular at the Manhattan Bar... ..is quietly having a drink. ..when the narcotic brigade raided the place. "Police! Nobody moves!" "Everybody, hands up!" The policeman that killed Kosheba claimed self defense. He got a reprimand and was transfered. Robert Kosheba did not carry any guns. And him? Died from amputee fever, I suppose. No sir, nobody talked about him. He hasn't appeared up till now. He's anonymous. We don't know who this person is or where he is. We don't know anything. We made some photos from that film. "I am addressing this person and to all that know him". "Please contact immediately my services." "Attorney Volney, tel. 344.344.33" "This number is available day and night". "I repeat: 344.344.33..." "Sir, if this photo is yours... ..I urge you to call us as fast as you can... ..because you were the witness of highly important events... ..but mostly because your life... ..and the lives of your beloved ones." "This was a message from Attorney General Henri Volney"... .."that will be broadcasted throughout this evening." Frank! Call this number. You must tell them everything. - Jeanne! Don't start again! - I beg you, Frank! Don't you understand that this is the last mistake I could do? It all must be forgotten. And we must also be forgotten! If you don't call, someone will eventually identify you. The kid from the butchery, the guy who fills your tank. What do I know? ..or your office colleagues. Well? I didn't note the phone number. 344.344.33 Yes. I'm listening. "It was Robert Mitchum in Young, Billy, Young". "Did I win?" No, Mrs. it wasn't him and we do not offer any prize. - "This is not a TV contest?" - No. ma'am. It wasn't a TV Contest. Volnney's office, I'm listening. "I knew very well the one whose photo you broadcasted". "His name is Bellony, Frank Bellony." "We were good friends". Why are you saying "We were"? "Because we lost contact... ..due to our wives not standing each other". Do you have his address? "I think he moved out." "As we don't see each other anymore, you understand" Hello? "I'm Frank Bellony I would like to speak to Attorney Volney." I'm his assistant Please don't hang up! Hello, yes? Attorney Volney? It's me. I'm the man you're looking for. So... I called so that you should'nt waste your time. It's pointless to keep broadcasting my photo on TV. I'm outside this whole affair. I didn't see or heard anything. And I don't want to meet you. You're scared and you are right to be afraid. sir... ..you may not know this but, there are 8 more people like you... ..that saw something suspicious on the day of the assassination. Glad to hear that. So talk to them. It would be very difficult, because... ..these 8 people are dead now. And not from natural causes. If you don't trust me... ..you will be the ninth. Not the ninth witness,... ..but the ninth cadaver, obviously. You're a perfect bastard, you. You must choose: the perfect bastard or the killer, sir. Good....Very well. - All right I live in..... - No! No! Don't tell me your address! Is there a pay phone near you? Perfect. Go there and call me from the cabin. We will trace the call... ..and we will come pick you up. Go there now. "Attorney Volney, I'm listening." I'm calling from the cabin. "Good. Don't move." "We'll trace your location and we will come to get you." "It will be a white car" "Don't hang up and don't forget to insert coins." I see a car. It's not as you told me. It's black. Hello!.... Hello!.... "Hello Mr. Bellony?" "We traced the phone booth We're coming to pick you up." Yes? "The Bellony family has arrived, sir." I'm coming. Good evening, Mr. Bellony. Good evening, M'am. Our assistant, Emilie, will take care of you. You can rest in the next room. So, all but me are?... Yes. They're all, as you say. Come with me, please. As soon as you have the second list bring it to us. Please concentrate well and look with attention... ..the photos that will scroll in front of you. The man behind the window on the 2nd floor,... ..I'm to recognize him in these photos? Exactly. Please sit down. All those who will appear were chosen considering their past. - Are you comfortable? - Max, please. No. it's not him. He was way younger. No. he wasn't blond, that's for sure. Good evening, Mr. De Palma. We are alone? I was told here you must make a reservation 24 hrs in advance. My dear Lacosta, it's 3 AM, this restaurant is not a nightclub... ..and this restaurant remained open especially for us. I don't think we can complain about the guaranteed discretion here. Please, sit down. A bit of vodka? Which one you prefer? Polish, Żubrówka, Svedka, Lemon or Russian? - Your choice. - Let it be Russian then. I'm not asking if you watched Volney's broadcasted appeal? Yes, by chance. The appeal hasn't been broadcasted since 21:00hr. Probably because Volney found the man he was looking for. This ninth witness that you let escape. No. No! No! Caucasian shashlyk. Mr. De Palma, I scrupulously accomplished my part of the contract. But, we are very pleased with you Mr. Lacosta. Perfect. In exchange for this work... ..our contract stipulated though two commitments from you. The first one: the salary. accomplished. The second one: my safety and my return to my country. For your safety we eliminated... ..8 out of 9 inconvenient witnesses. But do you think it's the right time to go back in your country? A few hours from now it will be maybe too late, Mr. De Palma. Right at this moment there is a man in this city... ..a man who saw me... ..who knows my face... ..and who will talk. No. The man that I saw on the 2nd floor... ..does not look like anyone in these photos. I'm sorry, but I can't invent. It's funny! There's one I would like to see again. - Sure. -I can? - For sure. Its among the last 5 or 6 photos. No, it was before this one. I think. No, it's not him. There! This one! It's really him! You mean this is the man from the second floor? No, this is the man with the umbrella. I recognize him, it's him, it's really him. He was a few meters in front of me, down in the crowd. I was with the other ones, on the catwalk. I didn't notice him at first as he was just like other people. and just as the president was shot or before, I can't recall... ..Flap! he opened his umbrella. With such a sun that day, I thought he's crazy, this guy. Excuse me, I don't think this has anything to do with your case... ..but it was strange to see him among those in your collection. - I'm sorry, Mr. Attorney. - We thank you. Mr. Bellony. But for your security and that of your family... ..you must take a forced vacation. Rest assured, we took care of everything. This envelope contains travellers checks. I entrust you to that young man... ...who will escort you to a special plane. Apparently, the weather is very nice in the Caribbean at this time. Come. We will join your family. Say, Mr. Attorney what did I do to deserve all this? Nothing, Mr. Bellony You just saw something... ..that you weren't supposed to. Have a good trip! De Palma, Carlos. Originally from Honduras. Political refugee at age 23. Suspected for a long time to be one of the... ..leader of a criminal organization. But, trying to prove it! Each time we tried to indict him, he claimed discriminattion... ..and he won. De Palma? He was sentenced for 5 years for fiscal fraud. He got an early release in less than 2 years. Put his phone under surveillance. Because you don't arrest him? No. We don't arrest him. What to charge him with? To possess an umbrella? If, with this ninth witness I'm exposed... ..you will be exposed too. You mean... you would talk? That's it? You know... ..I have certain dreams in my head... ..and now I have the money... ..as well as the age to make them come true. You're right! Mr. DaCosta. We must respect our dreams. They sooth us from the vulgar reality... ..and warm our soul. Let's drink to this invisible world... ..where we can our wishes come true. Very well! No! no! I'm not hanging up, I'm waiting. An extremely rainy day? No, I'm not interested in mm, nor the wind direction. Ah! No clear sky? Thank you very much. There's something I don't understand. Daslow goes up the terrace with a rifle ..to shoot three bullets on the president... ..but now we know the rifle was not loaded. Exactly! So why would one go up with an empty rifle? Someone provided it at the last minute. This photo is taken in front of his own house, rifle in hands... ..on 28th March 1977. I just called the local weather office. On 28th March 1977 it was raining heavily... ..but this photo was taken in full sunshine. Oui. Maybe it was taken the day before, or the day after. Day before or after... ..hydrangeas do not bloom in March... ..but end of July, beginning of August. Charly. It's a fake photo. They "put" Daslow's head on it. It's obvious! So, for months we've been living in the shadow of a fake Daslow? But verything is fake in this affair! Everything! A fake witness, a fake quilty, fake shells... ..fake dates, fake hydrangeas... ..and a fake report, with fake conclusions. 30 volumes of inquiry, 682 pages of conclusions... ..that does'nt contain even the slightest answer.. ..to the most elementary question: WHY? Why would Karl Eric Daslow shoot the President... ..as it was established that he had absolutely no reason to do that? Sir! The psychiatric report concludes to a case of paranoia. Of course! As we didn't find a reason, we concluded he's insane! Only this... ..insane people always find reasons on their own:... ..Either God lead them... ..or they had to save the world from a catastrophe... ..and they say so to themselves. And these psychosis... .. can be detected at some time or other during their lives. But about Daslow, nothing... ..Absolutely nothing. ..Neither school, nor from the army,... ..neither from his employers, nor from his daily life. We can't get any trace of psychiatric illness. All of a sudden, he becomes crazy, on May 22nd at 13:00 ..at 13:01 he shoots the President... ..and at 13:02 he commits suicide. Well, no. No, gentlemen! An visionary never kills himself! He gently wants to be arrested to shout his delirious vision to the world! There are statistics about this. The psychiatric report is based on a scientific experiment... ..by professor David Naggara... ..from Laye University. Perfect! Let's call him! It's 4 in the morning, sir! But.... What day are we? Sunday morning, sir. Ah! Good. Oh, well. Get to bed. Have a good Sunday and see you Monday. "The undersigned psychological experts... Due to subject's absence and consequently... ..and not being able to review the examination report... ..have elaborated in this report... ..on basis of K. E. Daslow's past. His inclination to violence... ..which lead him to this cruel and irresponsible gesture... ..can be explained through what we call... ..paranoid dementia." Prof Naggara, do you remember this man? Yes, unfortunately he's famous. - He is Daslow, right? - Yes. He has indeed, participated in one of our experiments. Did you read the psychiatric conclusions... ..about Daslow in Heiniger's report? I must admit I didn't. Professor, during the tests you run here... ..could you diagnose a man with a mental disease? Daslow, for example. In your opinion, was Daslow acting like a paranoid. Excuse me. Right away, I'm coming. A paranoid? Come. I propose you to see directly, one of our experiments. The behavior of today's subject might help you understand... ..Daslow's behavior better. Very well! Have a seat, Mr. Attorney. Through this one-way glass you can see without being seen. You have a volume meter to hear what they discuss down there. I'll be right back. Will it take long? They said about an hour, right? What will we do? We will explain in a moment. Ah. Ok. Gentlemen, here's Prof. Naggara. Mr. Rivoli? Ah no, Despaul. Despaul, Professor Then you must be Mr. Rivoli. right? Yes, professor. Gentlemen. a few words about the experiment... ..that we will conduct here today. A psychological theory says... ..that an individual learns... ..more correctly and in a more efficient manner... ..if he's conscious that every mistake will attract a punishment. An example of this theory in everyday life would be... ..the punishment that parents... ..enforce over their children. when they are making mistakes. They hope the punishment will incite... ..the child to better remember. At this university we are interested only with adults. And it is scientifically... ..that we will measure... ..and assess the degree... ..the influence of the punishment has on memory. One of you will be the student, which will be forced to remember. The other one will be the instructor, which... ..by progressive punishments... ..will force the pupil to use his memory more efficiently. The best, it appears... ..is to random draw to see which one will be the instructor... ..and who will be the student. I am the instructor. Then Mr. Rivoli will be the student. Do I have to sit on this? Please do! It's not dangerous, this thing? Wha... What is this? A solution to avoid the possible skin burns. Ok.... Oh well! Gentlemen, the principle of the experiment is very simple: Here's a list with 30 words... ..each one associated with an adjective. Sky - Blue. Animal - Fierce, Wind - Violent, etc. Mr. Despaul. You're going to read to Mr. Rivoli these 30 pairs of words. After that you're going to read to him only the adjective... ..and he must tell from memory... ..to which word that adjective corresponds. OK. I got it. For example, when I'll read "Blue"... ..he will have to answer "Sky"... .. for "Fierce", "Animal"... ..for "Violent", "Wind". You understood perfectly. Each time when Mr. Rivoli is wrong... ..you will inflict a punishment. You will push one of these sliders... ..and he will get an electric shock. At the first mistake, he will get 15 volts... 30 volts for the second mistake. 45 for the third,... ..etc. etc. As you can see... ..the sliders go up incrementally by 15V... ..and the shocks add up! Now, Mr Despaul, please read the word associations to your student... ..slowly, articulating well, so that he can remember them. Mr. Flavius will control the experiment. Very well! So..Sky - Blue... ..Animal - Fierce... ..Wind - Violent... ..Day - Chilly... ..Lemon - Yellow... ..Fish - Grilled... ..Egg - Hard... How do you enlist your candidates? Through an ad published in the local newspaper. "Do you want to make 6 dollars... ..giving us only 1 hour from your time?". "We are recruiting volunteers for a scientific experiment about memory". When Daslow was here... ..what role did he play in your experiment?... ..Instructor or student? Instructor. He was as as Mr. Despaul's. ..Well - Deep... ..Bread - Buttered... ..Money - Cash. OK. Please begin. Mr. Despaul. The first word: "Blue." Sky! Blue Sky! Correct. Next word: Fierce. Laugh. Laugh - "Fierce." No, wrong The answer was "Animal". 15 volts. Next word: "Violent." Just a second I know... ..Blow! Violent Blow! Wrong! The answer was "Wind'. Violent Wind. 30 volts. Think before you answer. Do you think it amuses me... ..to send these electric charges? Let's go! Next word: Chilly. Chilly, Chilly... isn't it "Fish"? Do you believe sincerely that these electric shocks... ..will enhance Mr. Rivoli's memory? Mr. Rivoli's memory has... ..no interest to us at all! What we're interested in is... ..Mr. Despaul's capacity to obey. His submission to authority. For Mr. Despaul the authority is this university... ..Prof. Flavius, myself... ..and our white overalls. which symbolize this authority. We just forced him... ..to punish a victim that did him nothing wrong. How far will he go to obey this absurd... ..and outrageous order we gave him. This is where the whole problem lies. Next word: "Yellow." Lemon. Very good! It was Lemon! Let's carry on. Next word: "Grilled." Bread..Grilled Bread. No, wrong! it was "Fish" - Grilled Fish! 165 volts. Stop! I refuse to continue. Please let me go. Are you telling me that he will go all the way to 450 volts? I don't know. You see, it's obvious that at a certain moment,... ..that Mr. Despaul will have to face a problem. On one side the submission to authority... ..carrying out the mission he was assigned. On the other side, the horror of making his victim suffer. Soon, Despaul will be torn apart by an almost unbearable internal conflict. To pull himself out of this situation... ..he must break off with the authority... ..and disobey. It's the moment of this rupture... ..that we are studying. Continue. Mr. Despaul. - Next word - One moment! Mr. Rivoli's right hand is untied. The electrode has no contact anymore. You must tie his hand again. I am the one who has to do this? We must run this experiment correctly. A very interesting phase of the experiment:... ..the physical contact. Until now he acted through the use of the sliders. He must touch a man... ..that did him absolutely no harm,... ..and that he is currently torturing, In this phase the rate of obedience diminishes. I beg you, sir. Stop! Why don't you concentrate? Do not answer half-heartedly! Let's get this over and done with. Don't want to spend the night here. He asked me to stop. What do you think? Please continue, Mr. Despaul. Ok. OK. Listen! Focus before answering... ..because we are nearly at 200 volts here. The next word is "White". White! Look here. Despaul tries to decrease his inner conflict... ..by helping his victim. If this conflict is so intense... ..why doesn't he stop? If he stops, he would admit to himself... ..that he should'nt have gone this far. By continuing,... ..he justifies everything he has done so far. Say, Sir... ..can we, for once, go to the next word? It is crucial to continue the experiment, Mr. Despaul. But he doesn't answer anymore. You should go and see. Maybe something happened! Even if the student doesn't like it, we must continue... ..until he has to learn all the words Eh! Mister! Do you hear me? The word is "White". (soft) I've had enough! (soft) It hurts so bad... (soft) I don't want to answer anymore... What are we doing? Consider the answer as wrong and send him 180 volts. He's not well at all. It could go really wrong. I take all the responsibility. If you take responsibility. It's unbearable! Even in the name of science... ..you don't have the right to do that. No law exists...... Stay calm, Mr. Attorney. The devices are all fake. There is no electrical power... ..between the desk of Mr Despaul... ..and the chair of Mr Rivoli. But Mr. Despaul doesn't know that. Mr. Rivoli is very talented. Isn't he? He's part of our team. Of course, it's essential for all our candidates... ..to be instructors. It's horrendous... Mr. Attorney... You,... ..it's at 180 volts that you have reacted! Your experiment is merciless, professor. What's the voltage Daslow stopped at? 405 volts. Sit down. "Think it over well!" "Otherwise I must send you 405 volts." "So, make an effort!" "Tartan." "405 volts!" "We must stop the experiment!" "Impossible. We can't fake the results. We must continue." "The subject's heart won't stand it, is obvious." "By continuing, it could be a disaster." "Apply 405 volts, Mr. Daslow!" "No way!" "First, you two must agree about this!" "One says 'Continue' and the other 'Stop'." "My discussion with Prof Naggara does not concern you. Mr. Daslow." "Go on, continue." "But me, I'm not continuing anything." "If you want, I will give you back the $6.00!" "Me, I'm going home." "Experiment stops at 405 volts." You see,... ..as soon as the coherence of the hierarchical system disappears... ..and the disagreements appear at the authority level... ..the subject takes advantage of it and refuses to obey. Did you have many subjects that went to 405 volts? On average,... 63% of the subjects are submissive,... ...fully accepting the principles of the experiment... ..and go... ..to 450 volts. This means that in a civilized,... ..democratic and liberal country... ..two thirds of the people are capable of executing any kind of order... ..that comes from a superior authority. Three months after the experiment we summon every subject... ..to tell them the truth and ask them to justify their own behavior. Listen to Daslow's reactions. "Mr. Daslow, you participated... ..3 months ago.. ..in a 1 hr, 17 min. experiment... ..in which you applied electrical chocks.. up to 405 volts." "Did you believe at the time.. ..that the electrical shocks were real?" "Yes." "Did you realized you were committing a cruel act... ..against an innocent... ..and defenseless?" "I didn't have to judge if my act was cruel... ..nor if the victim was innocent." "I had a superior authority that was there for that." "I did what I was told to." "When they order a pilot to drop a bomb over a city... ..He doesn't question himself if it is right or wrong,... ..he just drops the bomb." Yeah! But... ..in the case of a genocide, for example... ..when a tyrant decides to kill 5-6 millions... ..men, women and children.' ..he needs to have 1 million accomplices... ..of murderers.. ..of executioners. How is he gaining the obedience of others? By dividing the responsibilities. Foremost, a tyrant first needs a tyrant state,... ..So he will recruit 1 milion smaller tyrants... ..who each wil have a banal task to execute. Every single one of them executing their task... ..competently and without remorse. Nobody will ever realize... ..that he is the millionth link of the final act. Some of them will arrest the victims.. ..these are just simple arrests. Others will take the victims into camps... ..but they are only train engineers. And the camp administrator, in opening his doors.. ..would simly have done his duty of warden. Of course, the most violent ones... ..are used for the very final act. But... ..at every link of the chain... ..obedience was made comfortable. "Mr. Daslow... ..at 360V the subject ceased to scream... .. and did not respond which could... .. lead you to assume he's dead." "Why did you continue to apply him shocks... from 360V to 405V?" "If he's dead, he would'nt feel anything." "I thought the professors knew what they were doing." "If they think it's right, I won't contradict them." What surprises me is that all your subjects act... ..without anger, without rage... ..without vindictiveness,... .. without at least hoping for good wages. Oh well! Daslow certainly hasn't sent 405V for $6? Mr. Daslow. If the ad wasn't published by a university... ..but by an individual that would... .. promise you $1,000 as a reward... ..would you have still applied those 405V to Mr. Rivoli? No. What if the reward would be of $10,000? I don't think you understood, sir. Money has got nothing to do with this. I will obey an authority when I respect it. And that I accept it. That's all. Thank you. So, that day, going up to the terrace to shoot the President... ..Daslow was obeying an authority that he respected... ..regardless of any amount of money. But the same authority has already hired the real assassins,... ..those from below that were working only for money. Niki Farnese - the fake witness... Carlos De Palma... .. the man with the umbrella... ..and the assassin from the 2nd floor. I think the assassin is Luigi Lacosta, sir. We retrieved his car... ..and he was shot right in the face. Interpol told us that Lacosta was known as a professional killer. But why wasn't his picture among those shown to Bellony? Lacosta wasn't yet filed by the police at that time. He was an import product. He arrived from Italy on March 10th... ..2 months before the President's assassination. Their accounts revealed Nicky Farnese, the false witness, reeled... ..$5,000 before the murder and the same amount after. Luigi Lacosta cashed two cheques of $250.000. So who is that superior authority... ..respected by one... ..and financier to the others? Daslow and Lacosta can't speak anymore. Carlos De Palma? He's still under surveillance? Night and day. His calls are permanently monitored. Look up his parole file... .. to see why he received an early release. It came pretty high up... ..he was released with the intervention of Mr. Richard Mallory... ..Chief of Special Activities Bureau within the Secret Services. What motive did he invoke? "High services for the country". He was released on February 12 1977. Therefore, three months before President Jary's assassination. Ah! This evening De Palma dines with his benefactor, Richard Mallory. Good job, Bob! I found that in the phone tapping report. Who dines where? Mallory is going to De Palma's country place. So, with a bit of luck, there will be no one this evening at Mallory's! This meaning...? No gaffe, Charly. ok? Hey, block the elevator doors. Why? Because it's the best way to go back down in a hurry. Do you know what problems we will face there? Me, I don't! Usually, I work with plans, Sir. Alarm on opening the door, tells you anything? You open and....... You must not be here, Mr Attorney. If problems develop... ..you must not be involved. Charly is upstairs? Yes, sir. Alone? No. But with a first class professional. Garcia Santos. Whom we borrowed from Burglary. That's getting better and better! Garcia Santos? Four indictments for Breaking and Entry... Three, sir. If all goes well tonight, we promised him... ..to forget the fourth. Don't touch! There! Put these on first. Can you believe this? If I'd work on my own I'd be convicted for 3 years... ..I do this for you guys, and you wipe out 3 years! Isn't that great! Hello, Vernont! We're in. All is well. Shit. It's Mallory! Don't move. Mr. Mallory! Excuse me for bothering you at such late hour, Mr. Mallory. I'm Henri Volney. Glad to know you, Mr. Attorney. I hope you were not waiting for me? Oh yes. I don't feel guilty as I wasn't expecting you. Shall we go upstairs and have a drink? No Thank you. I prefer to walk outside, if that doesn't bother you. I hear all over that the members of the Secret Services... ..have their homes full of microphones... ..recorders and other such gadgets. There's much exaggeration. It's always like that. Tell me, do you know a certain Carlos De Palma? Carlos De Palma yes, yes. Sentenced to 5 years... Wait... If I recall, some fiscal problems, I believe. Exactly. Did you intervene in his release? Indeed, I intervened in few cases,... ..on behalf of Secret Services, but never on my own behalf. In De Palma's case, the reason was,... ..I believe, for "Services to the Nation". I hope I'm not too indiscreet if I ask you... ..the nature of those Services. In "Secret Services", the word "Secret" appears. Yes. In our trade, the first rule is silence. Rule that is shared sometime with institutions... ..like the Mafia, for example. I don't see a link. It was in jest, Mr. Mallory, a simple jest. Have you found what you're looking for? No, nothing at all. Worst, is I don't even know what I'm looking for. Ah! It's perfect! Say... This does'nt change our agreement for the three years, right? Zip! Zip! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why don't you look into the safe? What safe? There. Behind that copy. How did you figure is a safe there? I can smell the camouflage. You see the patina here? And here? They correspond exactly to the position of the hands... ..that unmount the painting very often. Can you open it? Since you're making me do this amateur job... ..there are only 2 methods: The delicate one... ..or the brutal one. First try the delicate one. Obviously. I have the impression you dislike the Secret Services. Mr. Volney. You're mistaken. I consider this information organism... ..absolutely essential. Without information, no modern nation... ..can guarantee the security of its people. For sure. However... These information soldiers... ..move away from their original mission... ..and turn themselves into an intervention army... ..which infiltrates all over... ..and becomes such a colossal force... ..that escapes the control of the government who created it. In such large scale organizations a mistake is always possible. Mistake? The Secret Service's budget is $10 billions for intelligence... ..and $200 billions for interventions... ..and $200 billions is no longer a "mistake" Mr. Mallory... ..it's an execution! That's it with the delicate method. What's going on? In reality, most all people keep using the same combination... ..over time, the key... ..always falls on the same number... ..has a slight wear... ..and it produces a different sound like... ...you see? But not so distinctively. With this gadget and experience, it can easiy be detected. And then? In our case the wear is so small, I can't detect it. He probably changes the combination every day. Let's try the brutal one then. Rest assured, Mr. Attorney. The Secret Services are under attentive and direct control... ..of both the presidency and the government. It's true, Mr Mallory, it's true. The president and the government control... ..this highly effective and discreet instrument. And they're using it too, sometime... ..even often. But when this instrument no longer obeys... ..it becomes very difficult for... ..the president and the government... ..to denounce their former accomplices. Only one who stood up against this inner state... ..it was President Jary. You should put the music on. It's not the time. As you wish. But I warn you... ..that the explosion noise will be very loud. It would drown the noise. Don't look for piano solos... ..an orchestra with lots of horns. "Charly, get out of there... ..this time, he's going up for sure Over and out." Thank You. Over and out. Oh well, Mr. Volney, this conversation was a delight. For me as well. Mr. Mallory. Good night! And don't let yourself be influenced by those novelists... ..that are always writing stories with an espionage theme. Even they start every story by saying... ..that all the characters and facts are fictitious. You know, when the source of imagination is not reality... ..It's not that good. There is no shiver nor suspense without reality or the unlikely, Mr. Mallory. Good night, Mr. Attorney. I think the hunt was good, sir. Why? Why is this tape so special? It's music fragmented by inaudile messages. It must be played at a certain frequency and speed in order to become clear. How did you get this? I was going to make a lot of noise for nothing. Sir. Mallory voluntarily switched things around. Probably nothing in the safe, everything in plain sight. It's really good! Do you want us to decode it? No. Thank You. Go and get some sleep.

Sir, the president is in Geneva at the summit... ..it was published in all the newspapers. Of course, thank you. Extraordinary assembly of Minos. Minos adopt unanimously the triggering of the operation... "I... For Icarus" ..the operation "I... For Icarus"... ..must be accomplished on June 17th... ..before midnight. I want to speak to Secret Services chief, please. Who's asking? Attorney Henri Volney. It is extremely important. Hold on. Hello? Hugues Adler? Henri Volney. Excuse me for disturbing you but I need to see you right away. My dear Volney, if it's a personal matter, gladly... ..but as chief of Secret Services... ..I no longer hold this position since yesterday. Dismissed! It will be official in 48 hrs. Who was appointed in your place? The chief the Special Activities Bureau, a certain Mallory... Richard Mallory? Yeah! Do you know him? Not so well. I'm sorry for you and forgive me for waking you up. Good bye. Good bye. Mr. President, I address to you this personal... and confidential message by courrier. ..because the conclusions I reached... ..are way beyond the limits imposed on my inquiry... ..and they concern directly the security of the nation. One: I can prove... ..that the assassination of the President Marc Jary... ..was careful prepared... ..by a pressure group... ..apparently not linked to the government. This plot was organized... ..in the name of so called "superior interests of our nation",... ..the "nation" being only an alibi. The leaders of this plot... ..do not want... .. to overthrow one regime with another. Quite contrary. They do know well the State structures and they're using them. Two: I accuse the Secret Services, at least, a faction of these services... ..to be the agents of execution of this "supreme brain". Three: I accuse them of working jointly... ..with the large international crime organization... ..when their interests meet. Four: I accuse Mr. Mallory... ..to be the main intermediary of the supreme brain of the conspiracy... ..and the different levels of action. Five: As part of this conspiracy, an operation whose code name is... .."I... For Icarus"... ..was already triggered to be carried out today, June 17th before midnight. How could we possibly know where this operation will take place? With consideration, Mr. President, Respectfully Yours. Henri Volney. Hello, Hélène? "Yes, Henri." Did I make you up? "Darling, if you didn't wake me up at this time, I'd be somewhere else." It's true! How was your dinner? "Boring." "We talk a bit about my book, because people are well-mannered... ..however, we spoke a lot about you." "These ladies came to the conclusion that you're a misogynist." Really? And what did you answer? "Why? Should I have answered them?" Yes. You should've told them that I'm busy with a woman rare to find... ..which keeps me away from women you can find anywhere. "Oh! You know you're really nice at 6:00 in the morning." "You should call me more often." "How's your inquiry?" Ah, my dear, difficult, difficult. I never felt so lonely. "And there's nothing I can do for you?" No. Actually, yes! What meaning has for you the name lcarus? l. C. A. R. U. S. Besides of the mythological sense known by all, of course... "lcarus." Yes! "My dear attorney. For once you admit." "You haven't read my book." "I speak in there of the lcarus myth." "I think it's in the first.... Wait, let me find the paragraph." No. I can find it on my own... "Here we are, page 198." "lcarus was locked by Minos in a labyrinth." "He escaped using wings he made." "He glued the wings on his back with wax." "But, in its flight he got so close to the sun... ..that the wax melted and lost his wings... ..and he fell into the sea named after him." "Obviously, all myths have a meaning that must be derived from folklore." "If we consider the sun as the symbol of truth... ..then Icarus burns his wings... ..for being so close to the truth." "There." "Does this interpretation help you?" "Hello." "Hello"
