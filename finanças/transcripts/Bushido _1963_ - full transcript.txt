TOEI COMPANY, LTD Hello, this is Iigura. Oh, Auntie. What? Kyoko? It was sleeping pills. I heard some noise so I went inside. I found this next to the pillows. Now that our love is broken, I have no reason to live. This is farewell. Goodbye. Kyoko. Have I driven her to death? No, it can't be. I love her. But she says our love is broken. We've gotten disconnected somewhere. What went wrong? As I questioned myself... a forgotten memory suddenly came back to me. I was a student when I went home to Shinshu for my mother's funeral. Here at Bodai Temple... I found my ancestors' diaries among the old family documents... that mother had entrusted with the temple. They were full of such horrible and cruel stories... that it was hard to believe it was the history of my own family. CRUEL TALES OF BUSHIDO Bushido Zankoku Monogatari NAKAMURA Kinnosuke OKA Satomi KISHIDA Kyoko WATANABE Misako MITA Yoshiko EHARA Shinjiro TONO Eijiro YANAGI Eijiro KIMURA Isao MORI Masayuki ARIMA Ineko Directed by IMAI Tadashi The record begins when my ancestor Iigura Jiroza'emon Hidekiyo... jobless after the clan he served lost in the Battle of Sekigahara and fell... was united with Hori Shikibu-no-shoho, a small daimyo of Shinshu Yazaki. "On the 5th of May of the 15th year of Keicho (1610)... 'I, Iigura Jiroza'emon Hidekiyo... 'offer my service to Sir Hori Shikubu-no-shoho... 'and humbly receive acceptance in this letter of pledge." You are now officially a member of the Yazaki clan. Never forget the generosity of our lord who recognized your skills... and has taken you in. You and all your future generations to come... must give the very best of yourselves and serve my lord... with devotion and loyalty, to perform your duty. 27 years later, in the 14th year of Kan'ei (1637)... they join the army in the uprising in Shimabara. The following year, on the 21st of January of the 15th year... A raid! Shimabara sneak attack! Alert! Alert! Don't let them get away! Damn peasants! Look, the fire spread to the Kuroda camp! We must put it out at all cost! Go! You had been ordered to be extremely alert. As expected, with their food supplies cut off... they fought in desperation, just as a cornered mouse would fight a cat. What were you listening to? It is an absolute shame that you let them burn down your camp so easily. On top of that, you let the fire spread to Sir Kuroda's camp as well. How are you going to take responsibility for your negligence? Go back and give it a good thought. Cold, isn't it. Those men at the top putting their heads together and getting nowhere. The clan is on the verge of being extinct. It's understandable. If the clan falls, we're affected too. In that case, there's only one way out. We should attack Hara Castle tonight. How much strength would starving and exhausted peasants have left? If we break into the castle, our mistake would be... Fine, if we succeed. But if we fail... We'd be persecuted for acting out of order, and only add to our shame. Then, do you have another idea? No. Wake up! Edo daimyo Sir Asai Kahei is here! Reporting that Edo daimyo Sir Asai Kahei is here. Is the soldier named Iikura Jiroza'emon with your clan for certain? What? Yes, he is indeed with my clan. He had cut open his stomach... and was found dead outside this morning, carrying this letter on him. Read it well. The case for which my lord Shikibu-no-shoho was reprimanded... is entirely and solely my fault. I regret miscalculating the status of the battle and caused trouble... and hereby make an apology with my life. I earnestly plead that... you relieve my lord Shikibu-no-shoho of the accusation. Shogun's Order! Your negligence is an unforgivable crime. However, Lord Matsudaira Izu-no-kami was deeply moved by this man's spirit... and ordered us to be lenient with you. Be grateful. Yes, sir! My lord. Treat his surviving family generously. Yes, sir. Evidently, Jiroza'emon gave up his own life in order... to help his master out of a difficult position. However, was it because he wanted to repay the kindness of his master... who had saved him from a hard life as ronin? Or did he sacrifice his short life that remained as an old man... so that his son Saji'emon This I cannot tell from his diary. Three years after the uprising... Saji'emon was recruited as a personal attendant... and writes in his diary how proud he was to serve his lord so closely. I saw his sincere devotion spilling over in his plain writing. However... It is ready. I don't want it. I'm concerned it could be detrimental to your health. Please have just one bite. I see my lord doesn't want to eat. It must be because you aren't feeling well. No need to worry. Do you have a fever? I'll call your doctor right away. I said not to worry. You will feel better once you see your doctor. I'll get him. Enough! Please forgive me! Saji'emon, take a break and wait for his temper to calm. I was being careless. I beg you to please forgive me! We will contact you. Dismissed! In his diary... he writes that his lord didn't like the way he served. He was grounded... and the 70 koku increase in salary due to his father's loyalty... was taken away. I lost the salary that your grandpa had earned for us. I'm afraid you're going to have to live with a sense of shame. Don't resent me for being a bad father. Yasu? Yes. Listen, Kyu'nosuke... Your father is a very loyal samurai. Grow up fast and be a samurai just like your father. Yasu, don't hold a grudge against our lord. I know. He was ill and irritable. It's already been a month. I hope he's feeling better. Sir, our lord is now in a critical condition. What? I, Tagawa Genzaburo, have a request. You have treated me with special care. Please allow me to die with you. Please allow me too. Everyone, our lord has fallen critically ill. With Buddha and God protecting him, we don't have to expect the worst. But pray for him earnestly. I suppose, if our lord does go... many of his followers will go with him as always. How come, grandpa? It's called the samurai's loyalty. When his predecessor passed... 40 or so of his followers killed themselves by seppuku. It was quite honorable. Don't stop me. My lord treated me with special care. I must ask for his permission to die with him while he's still alive... or I'll be a laughing stock. I understand how you feel. But if you go out while being grounded... we may be reprimanded for further misconduct. Please change your mind. Sir! Our lord has passed away. I'm too late. September 27th, Secretary Sir Kitazawa Yaza'emon kills himself to accompany his lord in Myoho Temple's main hall. September 29th, Personal Attendant Sir Tagawa Genzaburo kills himself. September 30th, Attendant Sir Yokoi Tada'noshin kills himself. What, Sir Ichioka died too? Yes. Also, Horse Attendant Sir Maebashi at Jigan Temple's graveyard. Sir Terada Take'noshin just killed himself in Sogen Temple's main hall. Sir Terada too? Thank you. Sir? Sir! Compose yourself, Yasu. You're the wife of a samurai. You should understand. I should have followed him before my colleagues did. Tell Gohei I want him to assist me. Gohei, get ready. He died a fine death. For the next 30 some years, nothing significant happened. It was now the Genroku era. From here on, I have to use a little imagination in order to tell the story. The reason being, while the writing remains plain and simple... the context becomes weirder and weirder... and just conveying the facts will never fill in the space between them. The diary by Kyutaro Tomoyuki, the only son of Kyu-nosuke... begins when he is studying in Edo. Tanba-no-kami Munemasa, lord of Tanba... happened to be in Edo serving his term at Edo Castle. Lady Hagi from the Lower Mansion is here to greet you. On this happy occasion of His Highness's birthday... I offer my best wishes. I am also glad that my lady is feeling well. Is she being sarcastic? I lost my lord's love and she says I'm feeling well? She's in the same boat. My lord hasn't been to her lately. How lonely she must feel. Thank you for coming. Sir Iikura! Reporting. Students from the Shoheizaka School of Academy... are here to wish you well. Invite them in. I permit you to look up. Tell me, do you enjoy studying? Yes. What are you studying now? We finished the Footnotes to the Ancient Chinese History... and just started the Book of Chinese Verses. What is your name? My name is Iikura Kyutaro. Oh, please be careful, please hold on to my shoulder. No, I'm fine, I'm fine. Well, it's not safe. Drinking too much could affect your health. All that is required of a lord is to drink and pass the days. The administration likes that, and you won't lose your livelihood either. Which one of you is Iikura Kyutaro? Yes, I am. His Highness summons you. What, His Highness? - Go at once. Yes, sir. Well, here he is. Now. Yes. How insensitive my lord is. He always tells me to groom his pretty boys like this one. Her Highness! I know I'm whining. It has been three years since my lord withdrew his love. I thought I stopped keeping my hopes up. Do you mean I'm about to be...? When ready, you'll enter his bedroom. His bedroom? I've brought the one you summoned. You can go now. Yes. Come over here. Go to his side. Go on. Hagi, burn some musk. Kyutaro, right? Don't be formal. Come over here and massage my shoulders. What's the matter with you? I'm telling you to come here. Yes... How fair your hand is. Well, I shall excuse myself. What are you doing to me? Please... please let me go. Please let me go. You're so cute. Please don't! What's wrong? Are you not glad you have His Highness's patronage? You have now become his personal page, the envy of all. And that makes you so sad? Please excuse me. The entry for that day in the diary has just one line: loyalty. Academic studies and serving me this way are both ways... to show loyalty to me. If both acts lead to loyalty, isn't this way more fun? May 20th - Service requested. Night shift. Received a silk jacket. Listen, Kyutaro, I adore you. Never have feelings for a woman. May 24th - Night shift. Received a kimono top. Kyutaro, I'll give you new underwear. May 26th - Night shift. Received underwear. You can relax now. How masterful! Can you understand my art? Yes, I think it even beats Ukiyoe artists. I said you can relax. Oh, please be careful. I am fine. I just felt a little dizzy. You look pale. You do not have to worry about me. I'm good. Now, come let us look at his work. My, what have you done! This picture carries too much of your carnal thoughts. Please forgive me! Please forgive me! Such evil thought never crossed my mind! You cannot lie to me. The way you looked at her. It was not at all a normal look. You may deceive others but not me. I told you time and time again not to have feelings for a woman. It is regrettable. I never did such a thing. You keep lying to me! Kyutaro, did it hurt? I'm sorry. I am humbled. I won't doubt you any more. So never do anything to trample on my heart again. Promise me never to have feelings for a woman... as long as my bite mark remains. My lord, it is me, Kyutaro. My lady? Yes. His Highness told me to come here. I am here also because he told me to. Do not stay out there, come inside. Yes. What is the matter? Lady Hagi, Kyutaro, His Highness has an urgent business... and is on his way to the Upper Mansion. He says for you to wait until his return. Thank you. Excuse me. He's always so capricious. Lady, I will come back later. Wait, Kyutaro, please stay. I feel lonely by myself. You know, Kyutaro, I grew up in downtown Edo. I do not know anything about your land, Shinshu. I hear you have much snow. Yes. What kind of games did you play? Yes, we couldn't wait for the spring... so we would shovel the snow and spin tops on the dirt. I can almost picture you as a child. Your family back home must be very happy that you have been recruited. What's the matter? It's nothing. No need to be formal. You can tell me. My lady, how could my lord... not cherish such a beautiful lady as you? I do not understand. Do you truly think so? Kyutaro, I appreciate what you just said. My lady... Oh, I should have noticed. I will do it. What is that mark? Well, it's nothing. Kyutaro, look. A bite mark just like yours. Right on the breast, a woman's soul. My lady... You and I both, how unfortunate we are. My lady... I have always adored you. Kyutaro! Do you want to kill yourself in apology? That's fine by me. I will let you kill me and die with you. My lady. You should not die. That was a rare feast for my eyes. Kyutaro! You trampled on my heart. I said not to die. You can live in hell for the rest of your life... to experience the consequences of breaking a promise. Expect to hear from me shortly. Take him to jail. Kyutaro... Kyutaro? Let me see your face, just a glance. Kyutaro! Iikura Kyutaro, we will commence the cutting now. Cutting? You won't be a man any longer. Submit to it. What are you doing? - Quiet! Now, do it. Kyutaro... I beg for your mercy. Please do not let me live. No. I forbid you to kill yourself. Live on until your time comes. Hagi, I'll give you to Kyutaro. I hope you two will live happily ever after. How grateful I am, how grateful. I had never dreamed we would have... Lady Hagi, who was His Highness's mistress, into the Iikura family. Kyutaro, you had better cherish her or heaven will punish you. Well, let me prepare red rice for the special occasion tonight. I have to invite relatives for celebration tomorrow. How grateful, how grateful... What's the matter? It moved. It's your baby. My baby? I never imagined we would have a baby. Lady Hagi, when the baby is born... we will raise it to be a fine person so that our names will be cleared. Sir Kyutaro... Kyutaro died at the young age of 25. Their child Masa-no-shin took over the family throne. The era was now Tenmei. During that period... many natural disasters occurred all over the nation, almost mysteriously. In July of the 3rd year of Tenmei (1783 ), Mt. Asama erupted. Farmers suffered from high taxes. The head of Iigura family at that time was Shuzo. His lord was Hori-Shikibu-no-sho Yasutaka. We are about to begin the annual sword tournament to offer to the gods. His Highness is looking forward to this event very keenly. Everyone is expected to exhibit the fruits of your hard work of daily training. Noda Kazuma wins. That's it. I heard that you have mastered something called the Sword of Darkness. This is a perfect occasion to show it to His Highness. I feel humble, but I shall if he requests. Iikura Shuzo shall now exhibit the Sword of Darkness technique. With both eyes covered, in true darkness, he shall cut the sign board. If he cuts both sides into exactly the same shape... please bestow upon him your acknowledgment. Indeed they seem to be in exact same shapes. Impressive! Let me reward you. Come up. Father and Brother Noda, congratulations. Come here and sit by me. Sir, I congratulate you on your accomplishment today. No, that's enough. It's not such a big deal to be congratulated by all of you. Sir Kazuma, congratulations to you, too. Thank you kindly. I owe it all to my master. Well... Sato, pour Sake for Sir Kazuma. Say, Maki... I was thinking we should hold their wedding in March next year. Indeed. If it is agreeable with Sir Kazuma, I certainly hope so. Oh no, I have no objection. It tastes bitter. They say vegetables stopped growing since the ashes from Mt. Asama fell. You may not like it, but please bear with me. By the way it's been about three months now... that we haven't had a drop of rain. It must be difficult for the farmers. What? The farmers made a direct plea? Yes. Two days ago, they waited at the gate... for Sir Yamashiro-no-kami, the son of Senior Advisor Tanuma. They made a direct plea, and he accepted it, and them into his property. What, he let the farmers inside? Yes. That is not all. That night, Sir Tanuma's messenger came to our clan's mansion in Edo. He delivered a secret code by Sir Tanuma... to mean that we failed to rule our territory and our clan to be dissolved. Impressive. You have made a leaping progress. Next. My lord, we have an emergency. Don't interrupt me. I believe bribery is the only way out. As you know, the clan's finances are in crisis. I hear Sir Tanuma makes all decisions according to the level of bribery... but we don't have that kind of money. But if we don't do anything, and the Shogunate hears it from Sir Tanuma... the family will surely be dissolved. Senior Advisor... What an honor to have you Senior Advisor to visit my humble home. Please. I have an order from His Highness. He says to send your daughter Sato to Edo... as an offering from our clan to Sir Tanuma Okitomo. Humbly receive the order with gratitude. It is the highest promotion a woman can hope for... to be a mistress of Sir Tanuma's who is the most powerful official today. It also benefits the clan and is an honor for the Iikura family. You have no objections, I assume. Shuzo, what is the matter? It is your lord's order. It is a great fortune. I accept happily. Maki? Sir... About Sato, I would like to speak to you. She's my daughter. I'll do whatever I want. Don't you feel pity for our young girl? I won't allow you to interfere. Maki... Let her do whatever she wishes until the day she departs for Edo. KYOTO DOLL KYOTO DOLL Is that the gift from Shinshu? KYOTO DOLL Yes. Yes. Too clever a trick for a country daimyo. All right, I like it. Are you from the Shinshu Yazaki Clan? Yes. Hori Yasuza'emon, the representative in Edo... and Iikura Shuzo, the clan's local member. My lord was extremely pleased with the gift of the Kyoto Doll. We're obliged. He says it looks as if it is alive. It is a great honor. Therefore, he says you can bring the five farmers back home. They committed a serious crime of making a direct plea. However, if we punish them heavily and stir resentment... in other farmers, we may invite unfortunate consequences. Please consider a lenient sentence. Kondo, what do you think? Since you asked... I believe that rather than being lenient we should punish them in public... to ensure nothing like this would ever happen. What do you suggest? I suggest that we set up the execution site... in Yazaki Woods and cut them with a saw. With a saw? I like it. Make preparations at once. Please have mercy! - Save their lives! Please, we beg you! - Please! Please! Do it! Please! - Stop it! Shurai! Jihei! Stop it! - Stop it now! Quiet! How dare you talk to the lord! Quiet! Quiet! We shall commence execution. Cold blooded! - You're demons! Damn them. - Cowards! Quiet! Anyone who yells despite our order will be made... to execute the men with his own hand. Understood? Stop it! Is this the way a lord should treat those... who served him for generations? Come! I'll kill you! Really, you saved us. So many vegetables. My husband will be so pleased to see these. Mother, I cannot carry any more. Little sir, I will carry it for you. That's all right. You're a boy, you can't be weak. Here, just a little while longer. Hang in there. Mother, how come our neighbor farmers don't share them with us? Because they don't harvest much due to the famine. But the other families are buying them. Farmers misunderstand your father, so they don't sell them to us. But you cannot tell this to your father. Why, I think it's our lord. Look up. Whose wife are you? Yes, I am Iikura Shuzo's wife. She's a beautiful woman. Naturally, she is the mother of the girl who enchanted Sir Tanuma. You always laugh at me for liking young women. You cannot taste the real flavor of a woman until she passes 30. Listen, Kondo... I want to order her to sleep with me. Well, you seem really interested. Bring her to the castle at once. His Highness is deeply impressed by your dutifulness. He recognizes the contribution your intelligent wife must be making... and wishes to personally offer her a cup of tea. What a great honor, we are grateful. However, she is not prepared to go right now. She can come tomorrow... No, that's quite all right. My lord has even sent a carriage for her. If she doesn't come, we may get us into trouble. Well, Madam. We shouldn't refuse his special invitation. Be careful and behave well. Yes. I will go and get ready. Please wait a while. Are you going to the castle, mother? I wish I could come with you. She's late. I wonder what happened to mother? You should go to bed now. Oh, it's mother! Sir, Senior Advisor is here. What, Senior Advisor? Good evening. What is it at this late hour? Maki... What happened to you? Maki... Maki... Senior Advisor, what on earth happened? Please tell me why. Please! Go to his bedroom. What did you say? Go to his bedroom. What are you talking about? I'm Iikura Shuzo's wife. It is his orders. Change your clothes at once. My daughter Sato is in Edo, receiving Sir Tanuma's patronage. Why do I have to serve as well? You cannot disobey His Highness's order. Hurry and get ready. Here you are. I was called here suddenly and I had to hurry... so I did not prepare myself properly. Would you mind me borrowing a perfumed sachet? Is she not ready? Yes, we'll bring her here immediately. Shuzo! What are you doing? I wish to reason with my lord. Hold back. His Highness is quite upset, saying he will ground you... due to the crime your wife Maki polluting the mansion with blood. Ground me? Listen, patience is all you need. It's important to kill yourself. Master, here you are. I appreciate your kindness as always. Master, it is regrettable. You served him so well and he fired you. Our lord is beyond cruel. Kazuma... Watch your mouth. In the past two months I was able to review the first half of my life. How loyally I served my lord during those peaceful days. I am sorry about what happened with you. Sir Tanuma Yamashiro-no-kami now leaving! I, Sano Masakoto, killed Tanuma Yamashiro-no-kami... for the sake of restoring the Shogun's Order. Listen, Sato... I hate to bring this up when you just got back home... but Sir Kondo sent a message. He says for you to serve at the castle. And did you agree to it? If I do, my lord may release you from grounding. Ryujiro won't have to feel ashamed any more either. I will gladly... I don't want to! I don't want to serve the lord! He forced me to leave Sir Kazuma and let Mother die. Rather than serving someone like him... I would, with my own hand... Sato! Master. Master? Sir Kazuma! Sato. I didn't want to see you ever again. Sir Iikura! Sir Iikura! Sir Iikura! Sir Iikura! Coming. Officers on patrol. Open up. We are searching your house. It is not even allowed to visit a man under punishment. And look at this... How dare you have an illegitimate affair! Get up! Please wait. - Sir Iikura! You're being grounded. Come with me. Get up! Hey, are you trying to resist? You still don't understand what I'm telling you? His Highness wishes to make you his mistress... to reward you for serving loyally for the clan. Accept it. It will clear your parents' names. Understood? You can keep asking me but my answer will be the same. What a stubborn one. Be prepared for what punishment may follow... if you refuse His Highness's request. Ryujiro... You're young but you're smart. Listen well to what I'm about to tell you. Yes. Father is going to reason with my lord. I intend to tell him to retire for the clan's sake. But it means disobeying him and I am prepared for the consequences. Consider me dead. What are you crying for? You can't cry over such a small thing... if you were to act like a samurai's son. I'm not crying. After I'm gone, grow up to be a fine man... and serve the clan well. A samurai is a samurai because he serves a lord. Know that you don't exist as an individual. The life of a samurai is not his own but belongs to his lord. Know that his highest honor... is to have a place to die for the sake of the lord. Know that loyalty begins with... killing yourself in order to serve your lord. Father has nothing more to say. Shut up already! How dare you come to lecture me when you're grounded? Know your place. Normally you would be paraded around town and hung. But I'll have you perform... the Sword of the Darkness to execute some criminals today. You'll be hung if you miss. There are two criminals sitting about 1-ken away from the top your legs. Understood? Take off the blindfold. Sato... Kazuma... Sato... Sato... Kazuma... Had I only known it was you... I would've never killed you if my arms were cut off. This is beyond... cruelty! You dare to stare at me. You said even if your arms were cut off. All right, as you wish. Don't defend yourself! That is your reward. You can keep the sword. I humbly receive it with gratitude. May the clan prosper. The life of a samurai is not his own but belongs to his lord. Know that his highest honor... is to have a place to die for the sake of the lord. Know that loyalty begins with... killing yourself in order to serve your lord. The life of a samurai is not his own but belongs to his lord... Lord Yasutaka died 7 years after the incident. As young Jujiro who was left behind grew up... Iigura family's bloodline just barely continued. The era was now Meiji. Shingo was the head of the family. The diary begins in... March in the 4th year of Meiji (1875) with an entry that reads... "I leave Shinshu for Tokyo with fresh hopes in my heart." Excuse me, excuse me. Hey, get back, you! I'm just going around the corner. Let me pass. Wait at the back of the line until the general's limo passes. This man is ill. He needs to rest at once. Not allowed. His car is about to pass. I don't see it yet. Let me pass. Do you mean to disobey? I'll arrest you if you don't obey me. Get back! Get back! Get back! I'm sorry. Please be patient just a little while. The sick man in the rickshaw is Hori Takafumi... the last chief of the Yazaki clan. Iikura... I cleaned the room for you. Thanks. I'm sorry I had to rush you out. Not at all. So, that's the former chief of the clan. Yeah. He doesn't look like he has any brain damage. It's sad all the more for that. Listen, you know the bar exam is coming up. It's fine to take care of your clan's chief... but don't neglect to prepare for your own exam. Thanks. Having said that, I probably needn't worry about smart man like you. Well... Well, just keep my well-meaning advice in mind. Well, see you. You must be tired. Let me take you. Here, sir. Here. Be careful. This is it. I'm home! Hello, dear. Please come in. Please come inside. Shingo is a curious man. Why act like an ex-samurai now? What's wrong with taking care of one's lord? You go by the lord of the old Toda Clan every month yourself, brother. Sure, I do. But why take care of someone with no inheritance. That's why I like him. Brother, you're saying such things because you don't know anything. I hear he doesn't have any children. And his evil younger brother who's after the family inheritance... forcibly locked him up in a cell. While living in a cell, he truly became mad. He was put in an insane asylum somewhere... and doesn't have anyone taking care of him, not even his wife. So Shingo took pity on him. Here you are. When I can't look after you, O'Fuji downstairs will take over. Ring this. Why did you bring me here? As I've said many times, I felt sorry for you. Now that you're under my care, you have nothing to worry about. I'm thirsty. Yes! O'Fuji, sorry to bother you but my lord is asking for tea. I feel relieved at last. You did a lot. You'll be happy to hear that the former clan members in Tokyo... are also angry about what happened and they agree to start... the movement to return my lord to the throne once he gets better. I see. He wasn't born with this illness. He's in a different environment now, so if I serve him with my heart... I'm sure he'll get better. We'll just have to hold on. Mr. Iikura. Yes. We have a customer. Can you go? Yes, I'm coming. I'll go pull the rickshaw for a minute. Give him the tea. O'Fuji, please, take good care of my lord. I'm Fuji from downstairs. Yes. What do you need? Not you. You want Fuji? She's retired for the night. Yes. Does anything hurt? I'm thirsty. I just gave you some tea. Please go to sleep now. Another cup! Yes. O'Fuji, sorry to bother you but I need more tea. Yes. What are you doing at this hour? There was a riot by the farmers in Niigata. I was summoned to control them. Are you going to be gone for long? If it worsens, it'll spread to Nagano and Yamanashi. I don't know when I can come home. That's hard work. Listen, Shingo... If you truly want my sister to be happy... I want you to reconsider something. You look so serious. What is it? No one can dispute that you're an intelligent and honorable man. It's just... I don't know how to explain it well... I understand. You're talking about my lord, aren't you? You want to say, why serve a former clan's chief now... one doesn't have to be stuck in the position of a lower-class samurai... one can climb the social ladder if one wants in this day and age. Right? There's more. Loyalty to the emperor is our new way of life. Isn't that what you want to tell me? That's right. That's right, Shingo. You don't have to tell me. I know these things well. But seeing how pitiful he is, I want to take care of him until the end. He's the chief of the clan my ancestors have served for generations. Of course I'm thinking about O'Fuji. I really am! Once I pass the upcoming exam, I can find a job. I will never let her down. Now that you've assured me so much, I feel relieved. Well, please look after business while I'm gone. Oh, the tea has gone cold now. I'll make a new pot. You'll do fine. I'm sure you'll pass. I hope so, but I couldn't study as much as I wanted to. Now you'll find a fine job for yourself. I'll see you later. I'll make a nice dinner and wait for you. Listen, don't be so disappointed. Study more and take it again next year. I'm glad for you. You don't have to worry about me any more. Let's part here. I'm home! O'Fuji, I didn't pass. Please stop crying. I promise I'll pass next year. Don't light it! What happened? O'Fuji? I'm home. I'm thirsty. Tea. Tea! My lord did this to you... Didn't he? My lord was alone for a long time. He must have been missing a woman's touch. It's my fault that I didn't realized it. Shingo, please forgive me. There's nothing to forgive. My feelings for you have not changed. The best medicine for him is rest. Thank you. - Take care. Fuji... Get Fuji. Please go to sleep now. Fuji! Fuji is my wife to be. I cannot. Fuji... Fuji! Fuji! Fuji! O'Fuji, please go up. You're the only person who can console the poor lord. Please. Shingo... Please. What kind of man would... My lord! My lord! My lord! This man Shingo was my grandfather. With a new lord at the top... he served in the Sino-Japanese War... and died in the 27th year of Meiji (1894). This is my brother Osamu's diary. Here he recorded how he felt about dying over the Pacific Ocean... as a Mitate member, without a trace of doubt... and with even a sense of pride. Tune up complete. All good. All right. Line up! The third Mitate unit of the Kamikaze squad... shall initiate an attack at the enemy unit passing through... 50 miles east of Ishigaki Island. You shall now receive a ritual cup of sake from the emperor. Humbly receive it. You saw your mother, right? Good. How's your jock itch? Yes, sir, I'm cured of it. You went to the toilet, right? Yes, sir, I did. Did you see your dad? Good. Your mom? - She was too late. A lover? No. I wish you a successful mission. 2nd Lt. Ooyama Seiji, departing! 2nd Lt. Fukazawa Ryota, departing! 2nd Lt. Nakajima Kunio, departing! 2nd Lt. Imamura Mikio, departing! 2nd Lt. Iigura Osamu, departing! Turn right! On the double, go! I had almost forgotten about this long history as stories from the long dead. However, as the one who was born from this long history... I was repeating the same horrible history without realizing it. I loved Kyoko and was going to marry her. But one month ago... Oh, that's news. So, did you set the date? Yes, one day that is convenient for you toward the end of next month. Next month is good for me. I gladly accept the role especially for you. Thank you. So, who's your match? Well, she's a typist at Asuka Constructions. We met in college. Oh? Asuka Constructions. How ironic that the company is our competitor. But she's a mere typist. I guess a marriage is a separate matter. By the way, about the new bid for Shinshu dam... I wonder what is Asuka Constructions' budget. Well... Any clue at all? I hear they're working hard toward getting it. So is our company. Is there any way you can get some information about them? We're desperate to find it out, even if it's one word. But she's no more than a typist. Oh, no, no, that's not what I meant. I simply expressed a wish for Budget Dept. that I oversee, that's all. Me too, I wish I could steal it if there were a way. But you see, she's just a typist... and she may be holding the key unexpectedly. Well, I'm just kidding. I accept your request to be the ritual matchmaker. Tell her so too. Well, thank you. Somehow his laughter evoked awkwardness inside me that stayed. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Chief agreed to be our matchmaker. Is that right? We need to set a date. Today I told Executive Kihara that I'll leave the job at the end of the month. And you know... He said he wants me to continue working for him. You see my job is a little different from that of a regular typist. I handle all the important documents. What's wrong? Nothing. Would you mind me working for a while longer? I was hoping you'd be a homemaker. But do what you want. Yeah? Kihara'll be happy to hear it. Did you tell him you're marrying me? I told him you're an average office worker. Oh, you... He persistently asks me what you're like. He thinks I'm his daughter. Can't fix him. You'd better not tell him who I am for a while. Why's that? Not that it matters but our companies are competitors. I suppose. Have they given you any papers about the Shinshu Dam yet? No, they haven't yet. I wonder what budget they're looking at. I don't know anything about the business. But how ironic we're competing with your company for the bid. But it doesn't have anything to do with us. It doesn't work like that for a man. He must work for the company for the rest of his life. You're right. Your company is important to you. Kyoko... When the budget comes around to you, will you take a look at the numbers? I want to use them as reference. That would mean betrayal... to Mr. Kihara who have taken care of me all this time. We must come up with a budget for ourselves. If we don't win the bid... it would mean we didn't do a good job and we're at fault. But... I know how difficult it is for you. But would you please help me? All right, Kyoko? I'm sorry, it's my fault. I'd love to do everything for you but... - It's okay. We'll do the best we can. But... If you don't win the bid... It'd be better than acting like a coward. Let's go. PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THE SHINSHU DAM PROJECT It's an important document. Careful with mistakes. What's the matter? You look pale. Oh, it's nothing. Well, I shall leave it to you. I bought some fruit. Want some? You look busy. I haven't finish my work. What fruit did you get? Kyoko! Did you copy it all? I'm still shaking. Will it help you? Kyoko! Kyoko! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Everyone... To the prosperity of the company and to congratulate your efforts... let's give another toast. Cheers! Congratulations! The president was happy. Your position as the next Section Manager is guaranteed. I'm happy too. Keep up the good work. Yes. By the way, I have something I'd like to ask of you. Yes? You said your fiancé is like a daughter to Kihara. Yes. What about it? He will be attending your wedding, right? Yes. He was best friends with her late father. I've given it much thought. It's a sensitive time right now. Can you postpone your wedding? What? What I mean is that I want you to wait until the dust settles. But... I do plan to be your matchmaker. But with Mr. Kihara present at the wedding, y'know... don't you think it'd be awkward? Everything went a little too smoothly. Of course we could just act like we have nothing to hide. But when something like this happens... people tend to get suspicious and talk. It's a sensitive time for the company... and I believe we need to be careful. This goes for the two of you too. I understand how you might feel... but will you do it for the company? I personally ask you too. I'll do whatever but Kyoko... What difference do a couple of years make? Your future is guaranteed. You'd better decide if your long life ahead isn't more important. Until the dust settles? When will that be? When... the dam is complete. If the company and your chief are the problem... we don't have to invite anyone. We can have a wedding by ourselves. We can't do that. Chief has agreed to be the matchmaker. An office worker needs to have a formal ceremony. What about me? What shall I tell everyone? How would I explain to them the reason... why we're postponing it for 2 or 3 years? Is your status with the company and life as an office worker that important? They're more important to you than I am, aren't they? Don't be ridiculous. Of course you're more important than anything else. But our life and future wouldn't be secure if not for the company. We can achieve happiness because of the company. It's a lie. Come clean. You didn't want me. Just someone who works at Asuka Constructions. Kyoko... You didn't really want to marry me. You decided to propose me because you wanted to know the budget. No, that's not true. You used me! Kyoko... then... Why did you show me the budget? Wasn't it because you also thought it was for the best for us? That's right. You're right. I guess... We can't do anything for ourselves on our own. Kyoko! "We can't do anything for ourselves on our own." ...Kyoko said. The cruel history of the Iigura Family... I read my ancestors' diaries and swore I wouldn't live like they did. Yet without knowing it, I repeated the mistakes they made. Kyoko! Kyoko! I was wrong. Let's get married, even if it's just the two of us. Okay?
