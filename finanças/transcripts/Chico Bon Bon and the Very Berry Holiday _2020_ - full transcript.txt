[male voice reading] [holiday music] [Neil] 'Tis the night before Blunderberry Day, and all through the city, folks are stringing up berries and making things pretty. They're donning their veriest berry apparel, and filling the streets singing sweet berry carols. ♪ Blunderberry Day, Blunderberry Day Berries all through town ♪ [Neil] The feel ing is warm and the mood is merry, as friends high-five under mistle-berries. There's one thing that they're all excited to see: the lighting of Blunderburg's Blunderberry tree! A very Blunderberry Eve! I'm Neil Ostrich, the bird with the word, and if you haven't heard, tomorrow is Blunderberry Day! I'm here at City Hall, where Mayor Murphy will light the town Blunderberry tree! [controller buzzing] [controller buzzing] Oh, no! There seems to be some kind of problem with the tree! - Wait a minute! - What's wrong with that tree? I sure hope there's someone who can solve this horrible holiday problem… You got a horrible holiday problem, we can solve 'em! Chico Bon Bon, thank goodness you're here! It's a Blunderberry disaster! What seems to be the problem? The Dunderheads forgot to put on the berry lights! "Berry lights"? We thought you said put on "hairy tights"! Yeah, we didn't do that, either. Mayor Murphy, this problem's no problem. Fix-It Force, let's get to work! [upbeat music plays] I'll put lights over here! Whoa! I'll do this section! Whoa! Sorry! You might want to just… How about over there... Oh, my… Aw, peanuts. Okay. If we're gonna get all these lights on, we might need more of a plan. You're right. We need route optimization! "Route optimi-what-a"? She said, "route optimization!" Route optimization means finding the fastest, simplest path to follow to get a job done! When we tried to put the lights on the tree, we went all over the place and got all tangled up. But route optimization will help us find the quickest, easiest path, so we don't bump into each other or put lights in the same place twice. And my route optimizing tool says we should each take a different section of the tree. Clark can cover the base, I'll take the middle, Chico can take the top, and Tiny can handle the tippy-top! Let's light this baby up! [upbeat holiday music plays] Just need to top it off with a golden berry. [all cheering] Way to optimize that route. Phew! Just in time, Chico! Citizens of Blunderburg, merry Blunderberry Eve! - [beeping] - [lights hum] [all] Woah! And now, for the traditional reading of The First Blunderberry Day. Chico, would you do the honors? I'd be honored to do the honors, Your Honor! [clears throat] "A long, long time ago, the people of Blunderburg spent the boring winters huddled in their homes, eating smelly cabbage soup! It was so smelly, folks had to keep their windows open! But then, one winter, a mysterious visitor came to town on a flying sleigh." Berry, berry, berry! "It was Barry the Berry Bear!" Oh, it's my favorite part! "And what did Barry bring to brighten up their wintery days? Why, his delicious Blunderberry Cakes, of course! He tossed them right into people's windows. The people loved Barry's cakes so much that he decided to come back every year. And so, Blunderburg began to celebrate Blunderberry Day, when Barry the Berry Bear brings his very merry berry cakes. The end." - [cheering] - Aw, yeah! Berry cakes! Mister Bon Bon, does Barry the Berry Bear really bring all those cakes every year? I'm glad you asked! - What's your name? - Poppy Kettlecorn. Come here, Poppy. I want to show you something! Take a look through here… [Squirrelbeard] Merry Blunderberry Eve! [Chico] Uh, a little to the left. That's Barry's bakeshop on Berry Bear Mountain. He's hard at work baking cakes for everyone in town. [chuckles] Berry, berry, berry! [yawns] Wow! And when you wake up tomorrow, you'll find a cake waiting for you under your Blunderberry Tree! A Blunderberry Cake of my very own? - Yay! - [device beeping] And according to the official Blunderberry Day Countdown, morning will be here before we know it! Can't you just use a watch to tell you when it's morning? I mean, I could, but this has a pretty tree with lights! When they're all lit up, it'll be Blunderberry Day. Better get back to the lab! Barry won't come unless we're all asleep. Goodnight everybody! Night-night, Mr. Bon Bon! [Neil] As it grew late, people went to their beds… as visions of berry cakes danced through their heads! All over town, in every house, not a creature was stirring… [snoring] …except one little mouse. [sneaky music plays] But to Tiny's surprise as she woke that night, there wasn't a Blunderberry Cake in sight! [dramatic music sting] [alarm blares] - [Rainbow grunts] - [Clark] Huh? What the... Uh, Tiny? Did someone call the banana phone? [sighs] On Blunderberry Eve? [dramatic music sting] [gasps] Blazing bananas! No Blunderberry Cakes! Did Barry the Berry Bear forget to bring us any? [suspenseful music plays] No berry cakes, no berry cakes! No berry cakes… No berry cakes! None of the berry cakes have been delivered! This is an emergency! It can't be Blunderberry Day without Blunderberry Cakes! There must be some reason why Barry didn't deliver those cakes, and we're gonna find out! Fix-It Force! To Berry Bear Mountain! [kids] Chico Bon Bon! Rainbow Thunder! Clark! Tiny! [dynamic action music] Whoa! [Clark grunts] Whoa! [Clark grunts] [computer] Tool Force One activated. [Neil] Off they went, racing along to Berry Bear Mountain to see what was wrong. [screeching] So much snow! - [brakes screech] - [Clark] Whoa! [sniffing] Guys, I think we're getting close! - How can you tell? - Don't you smell it? Blunderberry Cakes! - [loud snoring] - [all] Whoa! [loud snoring] [all gasp] What was that noise? I don't know. It almost sounded like a big snore. [all gasp] [all] Barry's Bakeshop! Wow, it's even more berry-ish than I was expecting! [Chico knocking] I just hope Barry's okay. [creaking] Hello? Mr. Barry the Berry Bear, sir? Look! Blunderberry Cakes! [Chico] The Blunderberry Cakes Barry was supposed to deliver. And there's Barry's magic sleigh! - But where's... - [loud snoring] [all] Barry! [snoring] He's asleep? On Blunderberry Eve? - Uh, Barry? - [loud snoring] [mumbling] Berry, berry, berry. Barry! [loud snoring] He's too sleepy to fly that sleigh, even if he put it on snooze control! [Rainbow] He must have worked extra hard this year on the berry cakes. That's why he's so tired! Aw, it looks like Barry just needs a good night's sleep. Thanks, Mommy! If Barry's fast asleep, that means someone else has to deliver all these berry cakes. Someone else? We're someone else! You bet your bananas we are! We're gonna deliver those cakes before everybody wakes up, so they all have a merry Blunderberry Day! Yay! [device beeps] [Clark] We don't have much time! It'll be morning soon! We'd better hurry. Load up those berry cakes, people. We've got a holiday to save! [Chico] Whoo! Mistle-berry. High five! [Neil] The Fix-It Force got to work right away, loading cakes onto Barry's magical sleigh. Fix-It Force, let's deliver these cakes! - Hang on to your whiskers. - [Clark] Rainbow, have you ever flown a magical sleigh before? Nah. But how hard could it be? [adventure music building] Oh, boy! [Fix-It Force exclaiming, grunting] [thud] Okay, so it's actually pretty hard. I don't know how Barry does it! I think we go with delivery plan B. - Tool Force One? - Bingo! - [Rainbow grunts] - All berry cakes accounted for? We've gotta hurry! Blunderberry morning is almost here, and people will be waking up! Clark's right! Let's roll! Let's get these cakes to Blunderburg, fast! [action music explodes, then dies down] Uh, Rainbow? I can't help but notice we're not moving. Too much snow. Better switch to snow tires! No snow tires? [Clark] Whoops! I kinda borrowed the snow tires to make our Blunderberry Day Lawn decorations. [crickets chirping] The snow's too thick. Oh, looks like we're stuck here until it melts. That's bad! Like, no-Blunderberry-Cakes- on-Blunderberry-Day bad! Okay, stay calm, everybody. There's gotta be a way to deliver these cakes without leaving Berry Bear Mountain. Whip out your umbrellas. It's time for a brainstorm! Special Blunderberry Day edition! People, ideas. What've we got? We could put rockets on the cakes and blast them to Blunderburg! Hmm, too explode-y. We could put them into boxes and mail them to everyone! Too slow poke-y. Ooh! We could fling them to town with a berry cake catapult! Too... Actually, that's not bad, Rainbow! Yeah, I know! With a catapult, we could launch the cakes into people's open windows from the comfort of Berry Bear Mountain! I don't like that idea, Rainbow… I love it! Fix-It Force, time to build a berry cake catapult! [Neil] As night wore on, under mounting tension, the Fix-It Force tested their latest invention. The cake catapult's looking good! But I think it's missing something. Berry lights? Perfect! [snores] Whoa! Rainbow, did you set it to the right angle? I think so. The catapult is aimed to launch a cake to Bon Bon Labs. To get it in the window, it might take a few test launches. Test launches? We can't test launch people's berry cakes! What if we miss? They're irreplaceable! Don't worry. I'll use my berry cake for the test launch. Tiny? Mmm. Barry, you've outdone yourself this year. Fly true, little berry cake. Fly true! Ready… aim… cakes away! It's gonna make it! It's gonna make it! - It's... - [splat] …not gonna make it. Hmm. Didn't go far enough. Sorry about your cake, Chico. We can use mine for the next test. Thanks, Rainbow! We'll get it this time. [Chico] Off it goes! [splat] [Squirrelbeard] Y'arr! Oh, too far! I guess we'll need another cake. Clark? Sorry, Chico, I got hungry. Thanks, Tiny. Last chance to get it right. I'm getting the hang of it! Ready… aim… [loud snoring] Whoa! Did the cake make it in the window? Aww. That's a negative, Rainbow. Barry's snore threw my aim off. - [loud snoring] - [Chico] Ow! Oh, boy. Chico, what do we do? It's almost Blunderberry Day! Oh, maybe there just won't be any berry cakes this year. No berry cakes? No berry cakes? Not on my watch. I'm not even wearing a watch! Think of all those people, dreaming of these delicious cakes. How sad they'll be if they wake up and find nothing under their Blunderberry Tree. They're depending on us. All of Blunderburg is depending on us! [loud snoring] Barry is depending on us. Little Poppy Kettlecorn is depending on us! We gotta do something. But what? Nothing we tried so far has worked: the magic sleigh, Tool Force One, the catapult… Hmm… They didn't work on their own, but maybe, just maybe, they'll work if we put 'em all together! I don't know where this is going, but I wanna go for the ride! Check it out! Tool Force One got stuck in the snow, right? We'll take the runners from Barry's sleigh and put 'em on the van. That'll get us down the mountain! Then, to speed up delivery, we'll add a mini-cake catapult to launch the cakes as we speed through town! Do you think that'll work, Chico? To save Blunderberry Day, it's worth a try. Come on, Fix-It Force, time to bring the awesome, Blunderberry Day style! [Neil] As the hours ticked by, and the morning grew near, the Fix-It Force kicked it into high gear! They hammered. They welded. They sawed things in halves. They razzled the dazzlers, and jiffied the jaffs! [beeping] Just when it looked like it couldn't be done… their Berry Mobile was ready to run! It's not a magic sleigh, but it'll get the job done! Oh, mistle-berry! Nice touch, Tiny! High-five! Hang on to your whiskers, everyone! Pow-pow, meow! [all cheer] [Clark] Whoa! [all exclaiming] [Clark] Whoa! You guys, it's working! Next stop: Blunderburg! [Rainbow] Switching to street mode! All right! Time to deliver some Blunderberry Cakes! [Chico] First up, Mrs. Coleslaw! Take it away, Tiny! [upbeat music plays] [Chico] Yeah! [Clark] We did it! [Chico] Next up: Mr. McFluster! - Nice shot, Tiny! - Yeah! Two berry cakes down, a whole lot more to go! Step on it, Rainbow! [Neil] They delivered the cakes, their method perfected… but there was one last problem they hadn't expected. Okay, we've delivered cakes to Mayor Murphy, Neil and Nell Ostrich, the Dunderheads, and Dr. Merv. Next up, Mrs. Coleslaw's house! Wait a minute! Chico, we already delivered a cake to Mrs. Coleslaw! We did? When? It was the first one! You're right! Well, maybe if we drive back this way, over the bridge, deliver to these houses here, turn around, and deliver to the Dunderheads... We delivered to the Dunderheads, too! Aw, man, so many houses! Blunderburg is just so big! How does Barry keep all these deliveries straight? He is kinda magic. Chico, we're running out of time! At this rate, I don't think we'll deliver all these cakes before everyone wakes up! You're right, Tiny! Little Poppy Kettlecorn is counting on us! Time for a banana break! Okay, so we engineered a great vehicle to deliver all the cakes, but it feels like we're driving around in circles, delivering to the same houses. [Neil] Chico thought and he thought, and thought some more, 'til he remembered something he hadn't before. Neil? Is that you? How come I can I hear you in my banana break? Don't ask me. I'm just the narrator! [clears throat] He remembered something he hadn't before… Remembered what? The catapult? The snoring? The bakeshop? The town Blunderberry Tree? [Neil] Getting closer… Wait. The tree. Putting on the berry lights! We kept getting tangled up, until… we optimized the route! Blazing bananas, that's it! We need to use route optimization! Of course! We have to make a plan to hit every remaining house once in the shortest amount of time. And we'll work together to get it all done before sunrise. Tiny and I will deliver to these houses in Tool Force One. Rainbow, use your Glitter Cycle to deliver to these houses here. On it! Clark, use the copter to work your way around the edge of town. Okay! It all comes down to this. We've optimized our route, now… [all] Let's bring the Blunderberry Cakes! And how about some holiday music? [festive holiday music plays] ♪ Oh, merry, merry, merry Blunderberry Day! ♪ ♪ Off we go through the snow In our fancy sleigh ♪ - [all] Hey! - ♪ Merry, merry, merry Blunderberry Day! ♪ ♪ Almost here, we bring cheer Cakes are on the way ♪ ♪ Oh, boy, lots of joy Treats to make you merry ♪ ♪ On your plate It's so great ♪ Hey!

As Blunderberry Day morning dawns, everyone agrees that this year's berry cakes are the... Best Blunderberry Cakes ever! How does Barry the Berry Bear do it? Well, folks, sources tell me that this year, he had a bit of help. [Chico sighs] Nice work, team. We saved Blunderberry Day. We sure did! [stomach rumbling] Oh! I could really go for a Blunderberry Cake right now. Too bad ours all got ruined. [distant laughing] [Barry] Berry, berry, berry! Huh? [both] Blunderberry Cakes! But how? - [laughing] - [all gasp] [Clark] Barry! Thanks for your help, Fix-It Force! Berry Blunderberry Day! [all] Berry Blunderberry Day! Berry Blunderberry Day, guys. [closing theme music plays]
