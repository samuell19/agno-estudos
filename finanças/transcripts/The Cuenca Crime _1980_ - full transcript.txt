This film, based on history, tells about events of more than 65 years ago, which were subject to a trial and on which a sentence was passed. This sentence was revised and annulled by the supreme court. There's not the least intention to offend any person, province, institution or body of state, as all of these deserve the greatest respect of the citizens. We dedicate this film to the village of Osa de la Vega All ye parents who have children! Children who have relatives! Relatives who have cousins! And cousins who have in-laws! See what nasty crime was committed in Cuenca by two thieves roundabout half past eight! All ye parents... Jos√© Maria! Son! Son! COURTHOUSE They've murdered him, Your Honour. They murdered my Jose Maria. There, there. Stick to what you came here to say. To report your child missing, correct? Is that correct? He went for a mud bath... And hasn't returned Three weeks ago now. Without saying goodbye? Or changing his clothes? Two girls saw him by the Palomar villa to say goodbye to Leon. They were the last to see him. They've murdered my boy. I feel it in my heart. Excuse me, Your Honour Mr Secretary can tell you what Gregorio and Leon are like. I wouldn't want my son to work with them. My son was fearful of God, but they... Ask Mr Secretary. Scoundrels, Sir. He has a point. So far, all you've told us is that your son Jose Maria was last seen at El Palomar in Osa de la Vega. And sent word that he'd take a mudbath. No more than that. You mustn't accuse anyone without evidence. What I can do is notify neighbouring villages. Then wait and see. They killed him. Gregorio and Leon killed him. He'd sold some sheep, and was bringing the money home. They killed him. Let's go through this again. I need his personal details. Madam, please calm down. To say goodbye to Leon, huh? They killed him. Murderers. That rabbit was mine, Leon. And I'm planning to eat it. Come to me. Here. No, give it to me. Go with him, go! No. Not with me. I don't trust him in the water, Gregorio. Go with Leon. Juana, I told you never to set foot in my house again. Take your wife, Anselmo. I might do something rash. When Jose said goodbye to the girls He said he'd come to see me. No one came up here. And I was at home by then. Down in the village. If you weren't in, how do you know no one came? No one came. You think I haven't heard of the lies you're spreading? Say the name of Gregorio again and I'll kill you. I'll drag you out by the hair. Stay still! Get out! We know nothing. Cegal and Lucilo did come by. And said your son was going to the baths. And he had a stroke from sleeping on the ground. Lucilo stayed at his spot. That's all. What have you done with my Jose. He must have gone to be rid of you. If you weren't an old lady... - My little Cepa. - Yes, Cepa! Good name for a short boy... from a family of drunkards. No insults! Murderers! I'll kill her if she says that again. He was sent for water once and it took him 17 days to return. He'll show up. He was a child then. Who would wish him harm? He's a good boy. He must've met a girl. My Jose. Where are they hiding you? Holy water. I'm sick and tired. Tired. Get out! I've had enough of these fucking church mice from Tres Juncos. Out! Anselmo, take your wife. Or we might all regret it. Come, Juana. Don Antonio Rodriguez Gonzalez Judge at the Belmonte court. I hereby summon to make his presence known Jose M Grimaldos, aged 28. Shepherd from Tres Juncos. He disappeared from Osa sometime on 21-22 August. His whereabouts are as yet unknown. A request to all civilian and military authorities... to investigate said disappearance and communicate their findings to our courthouse. Signed in Belmonte 17 February 1911 Where there's smoke... Jose wasn't around much. An illiterate boy. An air-head. I'm not saying those men actually... But they know more than they let on. No one disappears without a trace. Grimaldos isn't a minor. He can come and go as he likes. Gregorio and Leon couldn't possibly do a think like that. They're wayward. Raucous at times. But they're honest men. Far be it from me to accuse your servants. I hardly know them. But they both have a record. And they must be reckoned with. - Yes. I've checked the records. Gregorio attacked one of your own debt collectors. Mr Contreras. With a knife, no less. At the elections, Leon bludgeoned a man who had attacked Gregorio. You liberals like to think that everyone is kind. But I stand with his mother. Poor Juana. She served in my house as a girl. And I'm sentimental. The case was dismissed, Your Excellency. There is no evidence of a crime. So those men are innocent before the law. Tell the mother not to bother them any more. The animosities between Osa and Juncos are deepening. The Guardia Civil will have to be called in. The two villages have always quarreled. It's a political rivalry more than anything, Your Honour. The leftist element is strong here in Osa. Thank you, love. Hi, Varona. I'm glad for your recovery, Don Francisco. What's wrong, woman? Aren't you seeing the master in? - ... I was going to - No, Gregorio. We're fine here. I'm in a rush. And this is no pleasure call. What's wrong, Sir? It's a bad year. I'm being called... up in the heavens. I have to think of the young ones. To make some payments, I'll be selling the cattle. Tell Leon to pack I won't be needing his help. Leon must leave To Villaescusa with his wife's parents. But Sir, Leon... Not a word! I know what's good for you and for him. He'll find work there. He's been talking too much around here. - But Sir... - Yes. I know... He's a loyal man. I'll go where he goes. Son, I've always been fair with you. Keep your head on. It's for your own good. - Contreras told you to. Any day I'll slit his throat. Shameless. He and his election cronies. We'll see about the next elections. - Gregorio! If we win for the Conservative party, it's by God's grace. Better go now to the manor house. Autumn has come early this year. Oh... there's also... Those reeds... cut them right away. Why, Sir? Because people are going around... saying the wind blows through them and they hear Cepa crying for justice from the other life. God! Calm down, don Francisco. Calm. There, there. He's almost here. Father! Speak, son. I cannot leave like this. I have to... unburden my soul. Cepa never left El Palomar alive. He was killed. By Gregorio and Leon. Certainly... It was them... BELMONTE COURTHOUSE - 26/3/1913 Come in. Your Honour, Mr Contreras. our Congressman, as you know. Mr Contreras, our new judge Mr Isasa. His father was a minister under Canovas. I know. My pleasure, Your Honour. I see you're reading the press. Thank God we've won all the county seats. Except Osa, as always. Mr Contreras, until my family arrives I'm staying in the inn. May I treat you to lunch there? - With pleasure. And you can tell me what brings you here. It's nicely redecorated. Justice must be clad in dignity. Your predecessor was a man of simplicity. A tad too liberal for my taste. But a great man, certainly. The trouble is... the way things stand... What we need is a judge who ensures the law is respected. A man who's feared, even. We are delighted to have Isasa with us. It's an honour for Belmonte. You've heard of his work in the case of San Andres? Yes. Congratulations. The murderer was arrested in Tomelloso. His confession and was conviction took less than a week. Oh, Rodriguez. Quite a feat. Shall we? Anything else? No thanks. If I may... - Excuse me. - What a coincidence. In you go! Walk! The present dossier concerns Leon Sanchez and Gregorio Valero and the proceedings against them. Including preventive imprisonment in temporary isolation. A sum of 1,000 ptas is requested for costs incurred. To be paid before the first hearing. Failure to pay will result in an embargo of their property. Or bankruptcy proceedings. Additional orders, such as penal and civil duties are applicable. Police files and other legal documents will be provided to the courthouse. Gregorio. Is that you? What did they do to you? What did you tell them? What have I said? Yes, you. What did you tell them? Bastards! We got the judge to reopen the case so we can clear it all up. But you should stand as the private claimant. It's your lawful right and your duty to exercise it. It's your son, after all. You're so kind. But I could never pay it back. It's also the kindness of our good parishioners. They contributed so that justice can finally prevail. But my son is dead. No one can bring him back. Don't cry, Juana. The town stands with you. And if someone has to pay, then they should. God has mercy even on the worst criminals. We've questioned him for 3 days, to no avail. But we are making progress! Excuse me, Sir. So? No luck, Your Honour Don't they see they come across as guilty... with all those contradictions? Ungrateful task. Leon insists he saw the bonfire. Again? May I relocate them to the arrest cell? That is not in my purview. It's up to you to judge whether it's wise. Gregorio asked to be seen by a doctor. Is he ill? He didn't seem so yesterday Fulfill your duty. That's all I ask, Sergeant. To fulfill your duty. Yes, Your Honour. So Leon cut his head of and carried it off in a handkerchief. Well, well. Where did he cut it off? About here? Here? Your Honor. That poor woman. Ms Varona, Gregorio's wife. She came early this morning. She's here again, in the kitchen. You're too kind-hearted, Alejandra You don't realise they're taking advantage of it. At the courthouse they don't let her see you. OK, fine. It's fine. Let her in. On your orders. Thank you, Alejandra. When will you let me see my husband? You haven't yet? It's your youngest girl? What's her name? Maria Jesus. Can I see him today? We first have to get his affidavit. I'll have you picked up for a visit. Without further delay. - How is he doing? Fine. We had already told the first judge everything. Why is he arrested? Justice is slow, sadly. Too slow. Don't you worry, Madam. Bye, Alejandra. Serve Madam whatever she likes. And the children. And don't prepare too much food. You spoil me. Madam. Leon had jumped on Cepa on the road to the cemetery. Night had fallen and... I don't know whether Cepa was dead or not. Leon knelt down. And asked me not to tell anyone. They must have argued... - I never argued with Cepa. You have the nerve to say that? That I wrapped his head up in a shawl. Read Leon's declaration so that Gregorio can hear it. I know nothing. I said nothing. All of it? No. Just the bonfire. The fire, I saw it and so did all the villagers. Sure. They must've burned the body. His wife would have helped. Sure they burned it. I know nothing. Yes. He stabbed the debt collector with a knife. Sure he's capable of it. More? Water. I'm thirsty. What did you burn in the fire? The fire? What fire? Take this down. Having heard the inconsistencies in the detainees' accounts Now go crying to the judge. Stay still. It happened by mistake. Wasn't it, Gregorio? Wasn't it? It was... by mistake. It was dark out. And you thought he was stealing. It's not true. What's he talking about? Why does he say that? You know it's not true. None of it is. It'll be your turn soon. He buried him under a tree on the river bank. It was him. Call the judge. Now you'll tell us what's true, and what isn't. It was him Call the judge. I'll tell the truth. All the truth. Call the judge. I'll tell all the truth. Call the judge! Spare us the suffering, Leon. They're both equally guilty. Stop lying to us. You're drawing this out to make it endless. But you will not drain justice out. Justice never tires. Come on Say everything you know. Trust me, Leon. I could find grounds to be lenient. This is absurd. You're lying, lying, lying. We know about the cattle you bought in Villaescusa. Where did you get the money? Grimaldos had money with him. Precisely from some sheep he had sold. Help Justice, Leon. And Justice will help you. I need to know what you did with the body. - No luck, Sir. - Keep looking. So you don't know why I called you. We only live in El Palomar in the summer. So you assume it has to do with Cepa. Well well. You didn't hear anything, did you? Not a sound Nothing at all. Leon says your husband and you burned the body. He, and many locals saw the fire. But you... saw nothing. From Leon's declaration I should arrest you, Dolores. What would the children do? Go on, think about it. No one will save those men from jail. But we need to find the body. What did my husband say? That Leon threw himself onto Cepa on the road to the cemetery. Did he say that? And asked him not to tell anyone. But he would have told you. Did my husband also kill him? He says he only helped Leon to get rid of the body. I did hear them say "churchyard". But I don't know what they said about it. Maybe about burying him in the cemetery, with the dead. Was that what they said? That they'd put him in the graveyard? I only remember the word "churchyard". That's all. When could I see my Gregorio? Soon, very soon. Let's go. Water. I'll give you water in a minute. First eat. Then I'll give you water. Go on. Eat up. I'll clean you up. You have a hearing with your friend. Pull your tongue out again and I'll slice it off. It's of little use to you. Don't move or I'll cut you. Let's see that moustache. That's how. That's how Cepa howled. An easy prey for the two of you. He wasn't tall enough to serve the king. Don't let him fool you. He's fine. Keep going. Why don't you come out with it. Scream. Morning. Hoodlums! Criminals! Dr Jauregui, forensic medic will oversee the exhumation. Yes, Your Honour. Don't worry, we will proceed respectfully. This is where they buried the body, is it? Exactly there. We will now review the chronology of events. Yes, Your Honour. Come closer. The one who carried his feet can hold the point. Whoever carried the head hold the handle. The door was closed as always. Leon climbed over the wall. And I handed him over. I had him by the armpits. And he reached out. Then I heard him fall in there. We took the churchyard spades. And threw earth over him there. Give or take an inch. Come on, dig. It's impossible, Your Honour these aren't his. These are far older. How come there isn't a coffin? Some families still can't afford a coffin for their loved ones. They borrow one from the parish just for transport. Come on, dig. Until you find them. In the first grave... the body of a young woman. buried some 20 years ago. No coffin. They tricked us again. Like in the other exhumed graves. The bodies of an old man and a child. Deceased prior to the facts that occupy us and recognised by their relatives. Questioned for 7 days and they keep tricking us. It's fine, gentlemen. Thanks for everything. It's very unfortunate, Father. You may leave. But please come to the courthouse tonight. Walk this way, Dolores. Don't be scared. Come closer. What's wrong? Have you never seen human remains? Why weren't you here this morning? Weren't you eager to see your husband? Not like this, with everyone around. And I didn't want my children to see him. I stayed so that they wouldn't come... And see their father... - Like a criminal. The victim's mother wasn't here either. I didn't allow her to. Can you imagine...? ... a mother waiting to see her son disinterred? I know nothing, Sir. We've been tricked again, Dolores. When Leon confessed that you'd burnt the body. They spoke the truth. I have held back because of your children. But I have no other choice. You're as guilty as they are. Take her to the courthouse in Belmonte. No. I never did anything I know nothing. You choose not to know. You'd do better to collaborate with Justice. If you wish you can first leave the girl at home. I won't be separated from her. Don't imprison me. Let me talk to my husband first. Fair then. She'll talk to her husband first. We'll take her affidavit after that. Let's go. Water. Ask them for water. I don't know what you two did. But it's your own doing. And I've been arrested too. What will become of your children. Water. The judge is good. He'd save me for the kids. You don't know what you're saying. Ask for water for the girl. If it's for her, you'll get it. I'll tell the judge everything. If you don't, I will. That you... you fed him to the pigs. That you chopped him into pieces. You said I helped burn him. It's not true. I'll tell him everything. You know I didn't help you. Poor little girl. My poor little one. I'll tell him everything and we'll go home. Poor thing. I'll tell him everything. I'll tell him how you killed him. Water. Yes... that you chopped him into pieces. And what you did with the money and his clothes. And how you tricked him into going to El Palomar. I'll say it all. All. The money he had. Beast! Your wife's affidavit, Gregorio. Now we know everything. How you killed him, and what you did with the body. Let me give you both some advice. I can spare you unnecessary troubles. But only if you corroborate this declaration. I'll kill you. It was... you. Talk to Dr Jauregui and Dr Labarga. Tonight we'll have a flawless affidavit. Your Honour... Please let me look after the prisoners. There's coffee for everyone. Of course. We're not monsters. Do as you wish. Thank you, Your Honour. Is anything else required? Go Alejandra, look after them. She's like the Good Samaritan. You were saying, Rodriguez... Having obtained confessions of the murder of Grimaldos... doubts regarding his disappearance having been cleared... as reported by his mother Juana Lopez, before ordaining their imprisonment I requested a medical examination of prisoners Leon Sanchez and Gregorio Contreras by the local GP and the forensic medic of this courthouse. Dr Jauregui and Dr Labarga have determined that the convicts present no lesions or signs of any violence. Having read which report Dr Jauregui, and DR Labarga themselves as well as Mr Vera, I hereby certify their signatures. In Belmonte, May 1st, 1913. Grimaldos was lured into El Palomar by Leon Sanchez. Gregorio Contreras awaited them there. In a brusque, unexpected gesture that Grimaldos could not have anticipated or avoided he threw himself on him grabbing him by the neck. At such time, Sanchez dealt him a blow such that Grimaldos fell to the ground While beaten thus to the ground Gregorio stabbed him on the chest Inflicting a wound on his left side that would cause cause the instant death of Grimaldos. Without delay, the accused carried Grimaldos's body to the stable driven by greed, they removed from the sash pocket that the corpse was still wearing 75 pesetas, in silver coins and small change which they split into two parts. Three nights later on the 24th of August. they relocated the body next to the wall of the building, Where they burnt it used boulders to crush his bones, which they carried in a basket to throw into a river. It is thus fair to impose on the convicts Leon and Gregorio the death sentence that corresponds to robbery and murder. I'm Enrique Neyra. Your legal counselor as appointed by the court. Yes. Sanchez has withdrawn. He sent in his resignation citing personal issues. I understand this is an unusual situation. But I accepted because a man cannot be left without counsel on the eve of his trial. My request for the hearing to be postponed was denied. It will be held tomorrow. Contreras is still in charge of everything. Contreras? Who is that? Please, we have very little time. Time enough for what I have to say. I'm innocent. Grimaldos, as of yet missing and not deceased, I repeat missing, not deceased This I say, because all search operations in the alleged place of the crime have failed to find even the slightest remains to prove that he be murdered. Having handed his cattle over, as he often did, to Lucilo Parra, in order to take his bath in La Celadilla, in the county of Pedernoso where he had been before, he then left, destination unknown... and no further news of him has emerged. Without any indications that he might be living in Brazil, a country that he had avowedly desired to emigrate to. Lies! I have no doubts as to the innocence of my client Silence, or I'll have the room emptied. Continue, counsellor. I will cite from a book on the law by Montero Silence! ... which discusses judicial errors. In terms that seem chosen for this very case. Quote the text without comments, counsellor. It's all lies ... for once and for all! Out! Have them killed! Order in the court! Silence or I'll vacate the courtroom. Vacate the courtroom Silence! The hearing will proceed again in 30 minutes. Given the emotional state of the courtroom The hearing will be held in private. I agree, the public prosecutor has been very demanding but if you keep pleading innocent he's going straight to death by garrote. And if Gregorio gets it, Leon should too. Not that I don't have reasonable doubts that they're guilty. What we need to do, is save their necks. The public pressure is overwhelming. They all want blood. There isn't a single first-hand witness. But many are now talking as if they'd been on first row centre. Cut to bits. Bones crushed. Decapitated and fed to the pigs. Burnt later. The defence's witnesses seem to have conspired not to show up. Theirs, on the other hand haven't missed a single hearing. If someone actually wants to send them to their executioner. Our only option is to admit guilt and highlight the mitigating factors. Your wife is still out there. I don't want to see her. Listen, Gregorio. I spoke to Leon's lawyer. We will present the events in a new way. But you will have to corroborate them. We will say a fight broke out. That it got heated. Did you kill Cepa? I'm as innocent as you are. Now what do you want me to say? On the afternoon of 21 August 1910 sitting at the entrance of the courtyard of the house referred to as El Palomar de la Virgen, Leon S. and Gregorio V. ate a rabbit that Gregorio had hunted the previous day. As they finished their meal during which, excessive amounts of wine had been consumed a shepherd arrived, J.M. Grimaldos. as they had agreed he would the previous day. He was invited to a game of cards as a passtime, without any further interest. The above-mentioned accepted their invitation. ... as the game grew more heated and the wine was consumed to the loss of their sobriety... a dispute emerged among them. Grimaldos, threatened by Gregorio... threw a chair at him. Said dispute ended with the death of Grimaldos. Naturally such a state of intoxication is unusual. And was not pursued with an eye to committing any crimes. When I said the truth they didn't believe me. They did when I lied. The jury only debated for 30 minutes. That is not a good sign. Honourable colleagues... Gentlemen... The hearing will resume. Having debated the case... the jury will respond to the court. Mr Secretary... Is Leon Sanchez guilty of the murder of J.M. Grimaldos jointly with another man on 21 August 1910 in the town of Osa? Yes. Is Gregorio Valero guilty of the murder of J.M. Grimaldos jointly with another man on 21 August 1910 in the town of Osa? Yes. Is it established that the two men were armed with a bludgeon and a knife while Grimaldos was alone and unarmed Yes. Did the accused find umbrage in the night's shadows and therefore benefit from additional impunity? Yes. Were they intoxicated while committing the acts in question 1? No. Were they often intoxicated? No. Did Grimaldos, moments before the facts, throw a chair at any of the accused stirring their a bout of stubborn anger? No. Does the speaker for the jury have any doubts as to the above questions? Look, we have delivered you from what seemed inevitable. You have saved your life. - How much? - My hopes were raised when the prosecution changed the provisional conclusions How much? Dear friend. You owe your life to your own confession. If you had insisted on your innocence the prosecution would not have limited his demands... ...for death. Get the garrote for once and for all. Don't you understand? I don't want to be locked up for half a lifetime. You're alive, Gregorio. A few hours ago no one would have bet on it. Your duty now is to be strong. How long? 18 years. 18 years. Minus the years spent in the Belmonte prison. Minus any pardon that you might apply for. 10 years. 10 years at most. Think of your children who await you. It's them I'm thinking of, Sir. And I curse my cowardice. I confessed to something I hadn't done. All just to save my neck. I think of them. And I can't get out of my head that they'll think their father... has blood on his hands. How wouldn't they? If I myself have admitted to it. As if that weren't bad enough... they took his head, the noblest part of man and between their hands cracked it with two rocks. Like blood sausages spilled the entrails of poor Cepa. Death, deaded, killed. And they chant their liberal cheers, those who did murder him. Starved for the occasion a pig honks in his pen. The cruel killers have fed him to him for fattening. What the accursed pig fails to eat, onto a bonfire is tossed and the ashes drift along a nearing river. Now in the second installment we tell about the event. Where we learn that those who kill, steal and burn pay interest on top of their crime. An eye for an eye is the moral. Today they rot in jail, the perverse criminals. In Cartagena and Valencia where you walk in but never walk out. Because they are famed to be Spain's worst penitentiaries. Come, villagers of Mira on the Hill. Buy the Romance of the Horrible Crime in Osa. A shepherd slaughtered by his two companions. Only a few miles away did the tragedy befall. Give a poor blind man your money for his verses about this horrid crime. Small change, that's all. Come villagers from Mira... buy from this blind man the verses about the Crime in Cuenca. Bye, Jose Maria. Are you turning in for the night? No, I'm... Here, Mother, eat. Father. Manuela, give your father your seat. The soup is still hot. That's it, there. If this one stays, I'll leave tomorrow. I want no business with criminals. "Please send the birth certificate of JM Grimaldos Tres Juncos, 3/2/1882 of Anselmo and Juana and the death certificate of the latter as requested. Your friend and brother in Christ Feliciano Montero." Take a seat. Calm down, don Rufo. This must be a mistake. A request for documents to marry a dead man? It's an error. - It's stated clearly. His two surnames. And his mother's for the death certificate. Juana Lopez Gomez, as stated by the undersigned. Why don't you ask the parish of Mira for more details? No it must be a mistake. Or worse, someone who wants to stir the heavens. Don't worry, don Rufo. Not a word to anyone. If we had judge Isasa... we could ask his opinion. He would advise us. Put that letter away. Or let me take care of it. No. I shall write to Mira. As you wish. Care for a cup of coffee? - Yes, thank you. - Alejandra. What letter are you talking about? You misheard, Alejandra. - If you don't... - The judge will request it. Up to you. Parish correspondence is not his business. - It's my business. - I'm seeing him right away. Mother, Alejandra, you will stay here. God forgive me, but I don't trust this man. Fine, file a request. But I'll only give it to a judge. If Gregorio would just speak to me. Gregorio. I've been to Tres Juncos. What business do you have there? Cepa, he's around town he's in town. Maybe he is. Forgive me. I also thought you'd both killed him. You said it yourselves. If he's around... which might be true, then Leon is also innocent. As innocent as me. It could be true. I know nothing. I didn't do anything. That's the trouble with marriage. I also wanted to marry. The priest said it was good. I have a family now. And I said, fix the papers for me. And I waited. I waited. But... Hurry up Jose Maria. Now they got taken... out of jail. Won't they... come for me? What do you mean? God knows what you did. Here you always behaved. With some incidents, but still... You're wanted by the Courthouse in Belmonte. Come, sweetie. I'm coming along But I've done nothing. Jose Maria Grimaldos Lopez All checked. Off we go. - Goodbye - Thanks. It's me, Cepa! Cepa! I'm alive! It's me, Cepa! No one's killed me! It's me, I'm alive! I'm alive! No one's killed me! I didn't know anything! I got the heebie-jeebies, and I left. I didn't know a thing. I got the heebie-jeebies... so I up and left. Seeing as the conviction was unfounded, it is hereby declared null and void, for it has punished a crime that was never committed. The innocence of Valero and Sanchez is hereby confirmed. Supreme Tribunal ruling in the revision trial of 10 July 1926. The Supreme Court agrees to opening disciplinary proceedings against civil servants who deserve it. Supreme Court Ruling, 10 July 1926. Those in charge never suffered the consequences of their acts. They died before the ruling came out. Rumour has it they committed suicide.
