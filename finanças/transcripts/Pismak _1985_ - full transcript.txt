FILM POLSKI presents Fix bayonets! For the Kaiser! For God! For the Fatherland! Forward! It means that I'm considered... to be a personal adversary of God. Is God's complaint... duly stamped? You certainly keep everything in order. So what? Of course, inner order is important. This still remains only a dream... but I assure you it will soon come true. The most essential descriptions only. The war's far away. Typhoid, hunger and mustard gas... still belong to a future, however imminent. What are you talking about? Tell me... is the complaint in Hebrew? In my case, it could be relevant. I just wonder... if God himself wrote it in Jewish... or is the accusation perhaps in Latin? Stop these pleasantries. Who'll pay for the cab? I'm taking an empty wallet. So we know where we stand. You're going out again? We're supposed to lunch together I'll be back soon. I wouldn't be so sure. THE WRITER screenplay and novel with Music Images Direction Number seventeen! Over there. There's so much light here. Good. For your information, this cell... is called a "parlour" in our prison. Am I seeing straight? Yes. It's really us. And you? I publish "The Devil". It's a satirical magazine. You might not have come across it. The devil? How about that? You're an associate of Satan. Am I wrong? You're not mistaken. Some people call me that. They saw to my being here. Is there a better place for you? You're Satan's enemy, aren't you, Sixtus? He's got it in for him. Stop it! Don't go on. I don't want to hear this. He never loses his temper. Sometimes I think that he'd like to slap me. I'm only doing him a favour; not reacting, he doesn't sin. Do you like walking in the woods? Yes, especially in autumn. Even now, it's beautiful. Early spring. I know a place in the woods... where it must be particularly nice now. Listen! You can sit on the bed... but you mustn't lie! Do you like albums? With paintings? No, with photos. Respectable brothels used to have them. I didn't know that. Pity. You don't know what you've missed. A friend of mine once... showed me an old stolen photograph... of a girl, maybe ten years old... with long hair that fell loosely around her shoulders. She wore a garland. Do you know what was written on the reverse? No, how could I know? "Available only in her Aunt's presence". I swear it's true! How are you today? I've a pain in my bones. I can hardly stand, sir. Nights are the worst. I've told you repeatedly to see a doctor. I don't believe in doctors. Because you're an idiot. I've no time when I'm on duty. And no money. The one you recommended also takes money. Don't worry about that. Just go to this address. And forget about the money, My going away was Hump's idea. You'll never guess what he thinks. He thinks you must be terribly bored. That you must be bored in this awful place. Everything's okay at the shop. The new issue's out. Hump hasn't changed much. The censors made some cuts. Censorship? I don't remember what they objected to. Something's bothering you? Hump didn't give you anything for me? Just enough for the ticket. So you don't feel lonely. If you only knew how tired I am. Shall we roll down the blinds? I've left the factory. I've got another job. A better paid one, actually. I paint small portable screens. Chinese-style. I'm going to write a book. What are you talking about? The problem is in the narration. For better credibility I wanted to be the main character. It was a mistake. It is better when the author... remains unknown. An invisible observer... who narrates the events through someone who can't be recognised. I want to stick to bald facts. The world is fed up with... dreams that have little to do with reality. What the world needs is description. My dear sir, description... is the last thing the world needs. A revolt against dreams leads nowhere. The world's searching for truth... and our dreams are where it's looking. And most importantly... the world exists only within us. Only within us? Yes, it exists only in us. You've never thought about that? What about language? It's also a product of our dreams. I'd like everybody to want to read my book. It doesn't sound encouraging, does it? Especially when one thinks of a mission. Also, I want to make money... and I don't think it's an indecent wish. You'll never write a great work. You won't make a fortune. Why? Because you're renouncing your language. I don't understand. Is our language jargon alone? That's nonsense. Many have given up their language to master another. I do wish I'd convinced you. I'm not afraid of dreams. I'm leaving for America. For good? You have family there? No, I have no relatives. What are you going to do then? Dig gold? They have Polish newspapers. I will find a job. Well, what about my advice? Abandoning one's language is a crime. I know worse crimes. I want to remain true to myself. I want to be certain who I am. I must kill the weak nature within myself. I will send my book. I'll find your address. Do you at least know what kind of book it'll be? As a matter of fact, I do. Memories of my youth in Lublin. It will be a great work. I'll try not to write too much about myself. I'll use short sentences. And matter-of-fact descriptions. None of those tempting sunrises and sunsets... or the early morning dew... or the mist on the leaves after a hot day. I shall provoke, not soothe. Disturb... not lull to sleep. Wake up, please! You'll have to get up early here. I'm used to getting up late. Such was my life-style. It won't be long. You don't have to get accustomed to anything. You'll soon return to your work. It's not that hard to do, Father. In future... don't call me that. I'm not a priest. I used to be one. You're not eating? The food's hardly rich here. However long you stay, at worst you risk losing your teeth. If you have any visitors, ask them for onions. Well, gentlemen! We're in business. Do you know who cut my hair so well? Europe's greatest safe-cracker. That's how my clients brag. I'm going to write a book... which has got to be read by many people. In fact, I only want to take my revenge on those... who said I'd never write anything. What kind of book will it be? About you. About him. I'm glad you've told me that. Hey, you... come out! I beg you. Sorry I kept you waiting so long. It's a great honor for you. It's a whole university! How's the new one doing? I can't cope with so many things. Your papers are incomplete. Religion? None. Impossible. I don't believe in any God. Catholic, Orthodox or Lutheran. Judaism then. Occupation? Writer. I mean what do you do for a living. I publish a satirical magazine. Newspaper writer. Don't move. Don't blink your eyes. Take your seat, please. What else have we got here? It's him. Hello. Damn! It's stuck again. Don't look, please. I beg you. Is that all? A minute, please. You're the author of those filthy articles? One might think your case... is not very important, right? Someone who read your articles... might at first dismiss them as mere muckraking. You have permission to publish... a satirical magazine. In my opinion... it was a mistake to allow you to. You are now facing... a morals charge. In your magazine you attacked moral authorities... which are the foundation of the State. You'd perhaps like to know what authorities. I can tell you. You scurrilously attacked the Church. Actually, your paper's very name is offensive. So this is Satan's associate. I understand you're the author... of those articles signed "Beelzebub"? I'm not obliged to answer. You do have to answer. For everything you printed. Above all the filthy drawings... with which you spice your rag. Your abuse is aimed at authority. In your opinion, it is... illegitimate, corrupt and incompetent. Officials are imbeciles. So are the upper classes. They're the mainstay of the regime you ridicule. Your magazine favours anarchy and chaos, that is... anything that undermines the structure of authority. I'll tell you something. Your printers have also produced other papers... ones that are totally illegal. Perhaps you published articles in them, too? Under different pseudonyms? Do you have any evidence... of illegal activities? I have no knowledge of this. I had a normal contract with the printer. He says you owe him quite a lot of money. Idealogical fraud often goes together... with common crookery. Well, we've found out something, after all. You'll see what evidence I have. Meanwhile... I'm sending you to the devil. A great spirit often lives in a weak body. Are you alright? I don't sleep well, that's all. Nerves. I can't sleep either. It's not an illness. You're a journalist. Whose toes have you trodden on? It's irrelevant. A favourite of wealthy Jews and puffed up bishops. They also suspect you of fraud... connected with your publication. I know nothing about that. I have debts but that's no crime. No, it's very serious. They're cooking up a morals charge. If a woman's backside shown in a newspaper... offends morals, I'm here for life. I'll be accused of slandering... the government because I printed jokes... about official corruption. The point of the present charge... is to discredit me with the public. It's all grist to my mill. The newspaper devil transformed into a man. Can I ask for better publicity? I must also tell you... I didn't spare the local doctors either. I'd rather tell you this myself. Doctors are bound by solidarity. In matters of professional ethics, yes. What did you criticize them for? For their lack of feeling and love of money. For their disregard of poor people's health. For not knowing the meaning... of social service. Everywhere's the same. That's why I ridiculed them. If they fail to do away with me... I'll continue my campaign. In the meantime, you're behind bars. I'm not wasting my time. I'll make use of it in due course. Someone's ill in cell one. You may return to your cell. He works here? Yes. I don't believe in his remorse. Don't you think he's crazy? I don't know. You know him better. That's why I don't trust him. He's a devil, I tell you. I have a theory. Beware of people devoted to one passion. Their motivation comes from Satan. Quiet! It's rumored they'll use prisoners to dig trenches. I doubt we'll be used. They say the Germans will use gas. My lawyer's worried about this. Isn't the risk too great? The gas doesn't choose its victims. That's what gas masks are for. That's German thoroughness. They calculate the odds. What were you doing today? You saw. I also went to see the doctor. That drug addict? What do you mean? Didn't you take a look at his hands and eyes? So you did touch my things! Don't do it again! Or you'll have trouble. Dinner is served. I'd like to explain. Say no more. But don't touch my things. I saw that photo, but it was too dark. I thought I recognized the face so I took it. I wanted to take a closer look. A friend of yours? I was wrong. I don't know this woman. I didn't intend to upset you. Really? You may pay dearly for your curiosity. I mean it. Don't poke your nose... into other people's business. Got that? You're surprised? There's a chef in a nearby restaurant... who knows my tastes. How did you arrange it? I didn't. I have a family and many friends. They take good care of me. Twice the cost of a decent meal in a good restaurant. I've dined better in my time... and, to be frank, in better company. I always order Pouilly-Fuisse with the hors-d'oeuvres... and Cotes de Beaune with the roast. Move your chair over here. It's good. Excellent! This is Mr. Rafal. We met a short while ago. Mr. Rafal's going to write a book. About us? About me, too? You, me, everybody. He was already interested in you. We even had an argument. About me? Not quite. My girlfriend is an actress. I love theater. I can say that theatre has shaped... my whole spiritual life. We met in Paris. Didn't we? She'd better master Polish before taking her bow on stage. She's better at writing romances. They're not bad, I must say. So you write too? Alas, she also likes having affairs. She's too emotional. My angel, I say... they are more discreet about it. The French are like that. Life is beautiful. Women are beautiful. They're cold fish. Weak wine instead of blood. I'll show them that... theatre's a drama of passions... not pretending. She didn't exactly wow them in Paris. At the most dramatic moments... the public giggled shamelessly. Tell me something about yourself. About your book. The reader of today's novels... doesn't trust the author. He isn't sure if the author knows... the most secret thoughts of his characters. My method is like photography. I show the exterior leaving the inner self... to be discovered by those who hold the photograph. You should've left that photograph alone. Let the eyes, the clothes, gesture reveal it. That's very important. How interesting! I write only when I feel like it. You want to move back to Warsaw, don't you. I've already moved back. What is it? Don't you remember? THe theatre. Here's the basement entrance. The passage backstage. Getting curious again? Let's take a walk. You can tell me about yourself. You're writing romance novels again? What are those hieroglyphs? You read them from right to left? Yes, as you can see. Clever. I didn't know you were a Jew. Everything is beginning... to become clear. What do you mean? Personally I have nothing against Jews. Jewish bankers especially. Honestly. Sometimes we do business. Not with me you won't. We have different interests. I wouldn't be so sure. What are you writing about? Women. You Jews seem to have developed... quite a sense of sin. I've never thought about it. I lost my faith long ago. You only think you did. Sometimes in my dreams... I recite the Ten Commandments. Or other prayers. And I never get them wrong. I do worse when I wake up. Thy will be done, O Lord our God... and God of our forefathers. You know that? It's just come back to me. It's the blessing for a long trip. I read to practice the language. You've no idea how easily one forgets it here. Sixtus knows but a few words of Latin. Though he once used to say Mass. He's not what one would call intelligent. But then... where would the world be if everyone were intelligent? Who would read you then? Take a look. Don't you see I'm busy? You have nothing but time here. Aren't they beautiful? Disgusting. You're wrong. One can learn many interesting things. On closer examination the world of insects... resembles that of men. Excuse me. Let us fare forth safely... and proceed on our way in peace. Let our journey be untroubled. And let us reach our goal... in good health... joy and peace. Why didn't you send me clean underwear? You've never been very helpful, have you? Have you realised your plans? How did you get on in America? One shouldn't have too great expectations. Life is the same everywhere... because everywhere we live in the same way. But that world is different! If everywhere's the same... why not stay in one place? Couldn't you have stayed in Lublin... or Warsaw? You could've continued writing articles... or even published books. Of course I could. But I couldn't have been... homesick. Are you serious? Very serious. You see, everything will be different here. And I still hope that in America... I'll keep intact what we're losing here. What? Dignity, dear madam. You talking nonsense. You're like blind children. Seeking a Promised Land where you won't find it. You want a paradise for yourselves... come what may. Do you think it's our debts? I'm afraid it's something else this time. How will we cope? Who knows when the money will come in from the last issue. It won't be much, anyway. A kilo of onions. Enough? They say you get scurvy in prison. It's from Maria. She's applied for a visit. Try to dissuade her. I don't want her to come here. I don't see why you should... forbid her this pleasure. What about my lawyer? He's gone to Warsaw. But he says it's nothing to worry about. Your arrest caused quite a stir. It was mentioned in a sermon. Anything else? Our magazine virtually doesn't exist. Look at the latest issue. The censor's running amok. Everything will go up in flames now. It's the beginning of the end. We'll hit back! You mark my words! Time's up. Keep your calm. Do nothing until I tell you. Understand? I'm not stupid. What is it? Be sober next time. I'm not drunk. A few beers, that's all. You didn't even thank me, you know. I've done so much for you. She broke down. Don't forget to tell her not to come here! I'd like to have a word with you. We need him again. Have him fix this piece of junk. I have good news for you. The blasphemy charge was a misunderstanding. The "Devil" case is closed for the moment. It's you we're interested in. Me? What am I accused of? Nothing, we're not charging you yet. Only checking some information. This time it seems... to point to something really serious. Unwrap it, please. I don't understand. Don't you? We found it in your apartment. A search in my absence? Don't be naive. Two people have been killed with this gun. There are also other things... we'd like to clear up. What things? Have you been to Otwock? Yes. As a patient with T.B. Your health doesn't interest me. Clandestine meetings were held near Otwock. You participated in many of them. Our me were also there. Stop making a fool of me. Ignatius... Take this. So? I had friends there. Who? Names. I refuse to answer until I'm formally charged. Very well, there's no hurry. I'm waiting for more evidence. Then we'll proceed with your case. In this case, as I have not been indicted, I demand to be released immediately. I understand. But you must be patient. It's wartime now. I can report... that I suspect you of spying. It's been nice talking to you. You may leave. No complaints about your cellmates? Good company. A bigot and a hustler. We had an argument over a historical detail. There's evidence that Jesus had a brother. I didn't argue about anything. His name was Jacob. His existence is proven in documents. If it were, the Church... would have to recognise it. Extreme caution is recommended here. No conclusions can be drawn. We should know more... about the secrets of the soul. Is it your father? No. My grandfather. A fireman? A tailor. 12 Krochmalna street. May I? Please do. There's a strange stalemate at the front. In that case, why are they entrenching the town? I think the decisive moment is coming. Don't tell anybody about the map. Usually, cigars are not... allowed in prison. They're excellent, I assure you. Shall we break the prison rules? The doctor will soon be here. What's happened? Where am I? Uncomfortable? What's wrong with me? Typhoid fever. How long have I been here? A week. Why are they keeping me here? You have to be kept in quarantine. I prayed for your recovery. Aren't you afraid? It's contagious. Where's the doctor? He took your notebook When He came to examine you. We had no time to hide it. He said he'd give it back to you himself. You're awake? You still have a high fever. But the worst is behind you. I've read your notes. You write that I'm a morphine addict. Did Sixtus tell you? You've read my notes? I was sure you'd die. They suspect you of... radical views and maybe something else. I thought I'd better take your notes. Just in case. Fortunately you don't write about revolution. So you want to write a great book. Yes... and I will, doctor. Wasted effort and a waste of time. God's dying. There you have a great subject. However, I'm not a drug addict. I haven't got the habit and I never will. You look so ill! I'm still very weak. The worst is over now. I was finally granted a visit. I've missed you so much. Why don't you shave? Hump said your state was critical. Even though I can't pray, I prayed for you. I wanted to come here... but he told me you were only allowed one visit... and that you had urgent things to discuss. I could wait. Then you were taken ill. Hump told you not to come. Sometimes I think... we're incapable of profound emotions. I'm right, aren't I? Yes. Of course you are. I've never experienced profound emotions. And you've frittered yours away. Small favours in return... for equally small ones. Yes. Ultimately, you're a romantic scoundrel. And you? Me? I expect I'm a whore. We make a fine pair. It's not a particularly happy meeting. As always. So long. You don't know... why there are so many soldiers in the courtyard? No. I keep feeling dizzy. You're weak. Go back to bed. Where? You don't know if they'll stay here long? The front's closing in. It's said that there are... Polish troops on the other side too. And you'd like to see them. For God's sake I belong there. The priest said I was sure to see them. What priest? Sixtus? He's no longer a priest. He's a penitent. I know. I believe him. What he says is true. It won't be long now. If they don't take us away... tomorrow or the day after, we'll be free. I know. But I'm weak. You lose your health here. I should go to the mountains. I was advised to before my arrest. The doctor's waiting for you. You want me to help? I can manage. Who's he? A consumptive. Did he talk about himself? No. I wonder if everyone... eventually becomes numb. I'm beginning to realise... that what surrounds us is perfectly normal. Am I catching the prison disease? No, of course not. This is absurd. You have your religious mania. Perhaps it's a revolt? I don't revolt against my fate. You've hit rock bottom? That happened long ago. Before being arrested. What did you feel when you were taken away? Who? You, those people and her. They took her away in a closed cab. You never saw each other again. What did you want to tell her? You're ashamed? Even today? You've forgotten that... there was such a moment in your life? You often talk about conscience but... how did your heart react? I'm sorry. Forgive me, please. What will they do with me? I've been trapped. I wish I could forget about this. Have you heard the news? The safecracker and the warder have fled! And you? Shall I discharge you? The warden asked when I'd do it. I told him you were still too weak. Thank you, doctor. They're too interested in me. I should have been released already. Everyone says that. You're not missing anything. What will they do with me? You'll be told when the time comes. I didn't sleep at all last night. It doesn't show, does it? Why are you silent? So you've caught me red-handed. I could hardly move this morning. Ailments which exhaust me mentally... A battle with myself... No wonder I'm physically weak. Can I have some water? Of course. In the carafe. Unless that idiot forgot to fill it. I must tell you... They're expecting me. What is it? I must escape from here. You too? Why? I've been accused of complicity in murder. It's not true. They have no proof. If accusation is false... the truth will come out. Think for a moment. Do innocent people run away? Ready! Take aim! Fire! I didn't expect to find you here. You can't sleep? I wanted Sixtus to give me a sleeping pill. I've sent him back to his cell. He's getting on my nerves with his constant prayers. Would you like a glass? It'll do me good today, too. I think we feel the same. What? That we're superfluous. Am I right? I hadn't thought about it. I've still no idea what's a result of the fever... and what's normal perception. It'll pass. However, the feeling I'm talking about... doesn't disappear with the disease. Go on, doctor. Do you think that what you see is real? The table and the lamp are real. But if instead of the lamp you saw a milky spot... assuming the shape of a stooping angel... you say it's a hallucination. Is a deep space in which colours pulsate... less real? I'm trying to make a point. About truth. In your notes, you say it's necessary to define truth. But what is truth? The necessity of constant distortion? Distortion of reality. Those are laws which don't apply to art alone. Get some sleep. We have a long night ahead of us. He shouldn't have screamed at the last moment. It made no difference. It could have been much worse. You have no idea... what people will do when they face a firing squad. How they fight for every minute, every breath. Do get some sleep. Rest. Where have you been? You wanted to write, so write. We've been waiting for you. I've been informed... that they've designated the judges... who are to hear your case. Do you wish to engage a lawyer? It'll be expensive. - Must I decide now? - No, there's no hurry. There are still some questions remaining. Bring in the prisoner! You mustn't get so worked up. We're still only speaking of facts. I just thought... I'd have a surprise for you. You've changed. I can't live with all this. They'll spare us nothing. You're not in a cafe... dishing the dirt. Stop shouting. Effrontery will get you nowhere! You're a murderer and a thief. I often think about you... A murder and a thief! You're not to be blamed for anything. Let it weigh on my conscience. Try to forget about it. When did you plan the murder? We didn't plot to kill anybody Why, having lured him to your cell, did you hide the axe? It's not her fault. Really? Didn't you want your husband killed? No. Why didn't you report the murderer to the police? When he admitted the killing... you were overcome with hatred? That's what you said during the hearing. I lied. I didn't hate him then. You shouldn't have told them that. Take away the prisoner. I know this woman lied. But we need this lie. We must prove that it was premeditated. Why should we pay for other people's sins... with our own health? Because sometimes we're also guilty. I like that. Am I to blame myself? For what? I don't know. I'm also very tired. It's so hot. Do you have anything to drink? Go to hell. How long will they keep you here? I've no idea. Didn't you ask? Whom? You look terrible. What's wrong? Lice. I can't get rid of them. You're hysterical. You have no questions? Don't you want to know about Maria? Just as well. Because she's gone away. It was to be expected. Are you asleep? I wouldn't be dreaming of you. Alright, go on thinking of yourself. Don't worry. I'll manage. You must get up. Can you hear me? You're free. What happened to me? Everyone's fled. They wanted to burn the prison. They would've done if they'd had more time. He died that night. Listen... you're also free. I'm staying. God be with you. It's good cloth. The color’s not so good, though. Are these the angels God sends to save us? If you succeed, I'll call it a miracle. Such a miracle happens once in a hundred years. Do you understand me? Thy will be done, O Lord our God... and God of our forefathers. Let us fare forth safely... and proceed on our way in peace. Let our journey be untroubled... and let us reach our goal in good health, joy and peace. Protects us from enemies lying in wait for us... and from the woes that descend upon the world. And bless all our actions. Subtitles: MENiSCUS
