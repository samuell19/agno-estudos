Muqing our classmate What are you going to do exactly? Speak out if you have anything on mind. It you have any trouble you can tell me. I will help you.

Let me out. You can't open it. You have been deceiving me. I didn't deceive you. You bring them here, and I will also finish my task. I have drawn the blood for you Why don't you let them go? You are too naive. Do you think... that the evils can be suppressed, only by several tubes of blood? You are so simple minded. But... you said that you want the blood of eight persons. If I don't say like that... would you bring them here? You have some other intention by asking me to bring them here. Don't you think? No. You can't. You can't kill them. They are innocent. Only the dead... can suppress the evils. Otherwise why there were... eight coffins hundreds of years ago? Bullshit! We are going to make the evil... never rise again. That's their destiny. I beg you. I beg you to let them go. I beg you... to let them go. They are chosen by the evil. That's their destiny. and it is also yours. He has been lying to me. What should I do? Muqing! Muqing! Muqing! No, I have to save them. What should we do? What can we do? We can only wait Muqing to come back. When will she come back? Yeah. when will she come back? She can't come back. You are chosen by the evil. You guys have to die. Are you human being or ghost? Dug! Duqi! wake up. Duqi Muqing! Muqing! You have no where to run. You are all to be dead. Come up. Quick. Run. Have a rest here. Allen go there to find the exit. I will go this way. The upstairs has been blocked. The downstairs... has been blocked, too. We can't go outside. The signal has been cut. I just checked right now. The telephone line and network cable has... all been cut off. What should we do? Wait till the daybreak. Muqing! How are you? I am all right. Are you conscious now? Stay here. I will go to find the lights. I have checked. There is nobody. I am sorry. It's all my fault. What's meaning of apologizing, now? Who would know what else conspiracy you have? No more words. Nobody will believe... your words any more. Mengqi! Let Muqing finish her words. Do you want to be eaten by the ghost? All right. Don't argure any more! What matters now... is to escape. Muqing! is there any other exit here? I only come here once. What should we do? We can't wait to be killed. I don't expect that. it would turn out like that. You guys must want to know... why I deceived you to come here. The location of this theatre... Was originally built upon an old downtown. Three years ago it was chosen by a Taiwanese boss. He found a high rank monk to... hold a ceremony before the theatre project started. The monk said to him... that this place is the entrance of the hell for the city. Evil ghosts of adults or children come and go. The ground should not be broken. If it is built with park or temple... it could bring virtues If it is built with commercial area... it could bring your family misfortune. The developer... didn't listen to the warning of the monk. In less than two months... he was bitten by a dog... at the construction site. And he was painful to death. after he was sent to the hospital. My dad was the second developer. Two years ago he took over this project... and this cinema was built by him. My dad was born here. There used to be a cinema in the old downtown. He often leaned on the window to watches movies. Since then he had a dream when he is rich. he would rebuild a cinema for this town. So he insisted on developing this project. On the first day workers... couldn't beat stakes into the ground. On the second day... there were eight coffins dug... out with... rotten corpses. This place was originally a grave. so my dad didn't take it to heart. Unexpectedly after the... cinema finished... my dad was badly ill. But... why do you take us here? One month ago... my dad was near the boundry of his life. I was in such a desperate situation. Someone found me on the internet. Is that the guy who play tricks with us? Yes. He seems... to know everything. He said that... it was due to eight coffins. They were used to suppress the evil ghosts... at the deer of death. But they were dug out by my dad... so the evil ghosts ran out to take revenge. We have to suppress... them into the door of death. them into the door of death. for saving my dad. Two hundred years ago, ancient people used Eight-Diagram tactic... to bury these eight corpses into the... underground for surrendering... the evils. Now We have find... eight people whose horoscopes are same with them Apply their blood to the place of the eight coffins. That is the seat... where you guys sit so that it will play its magic. So you take advantage of our blood. I am sorry. I am too anxious to save my dad. He has been... tracking you guys. You mean Mr. Pan. You hired him. I beg him to help me. It's me who harm him. Have you seen that guy? He found me on the internet. I thought that he only wanted the blood of eight persons. To my surprise He wanted to kill people. It's all right. we are all here. Is he human being or ghost? I don't know. I always feel... that he... is around us. Help! Listen! Help me! Help me! It seems that someone is calling for help. It seems that somebody is behind. There is nobody. Just a shadow. Ah ghost. Allen! Allen! Leave. Ghost! Allen! What's up? We really saw a ghost... in the corridor. Where is Mr.Pan? Help me. Help me. Help me. I have to save him. You can't! It's too dangerous! Do you really want to go? I can't leave Mr. Pan alone. He will be killed. Let me go with you. Wait. I will go too. Me too. You stay here... and take care of everyone. Duqi! They need you You. stay here to accompany them. I'll go with Xiaoqing. Muqing Are you afraid? I am okay. How come they haven't... come back after so long? Aren't they killed by the ghost? What are you talking about? Be very careful. I know. there is a back door. Back door? There is a back door. This is awesome. Be quick Hurry. Hurry up. Go. Hurry up. Come on. Go. Go. There is no road here. The door is over there. It's not there. There is a door behind the box. Go to help. Go go. Muqing Take care of Mr. Pan. Okay. Be careful. Here you are. Here you are. How do you feel? I am ok. I am alright. Come on Give it to me. Miss Yu! Can I... ask you a question? Why? did you... take risks to come back... for me? How can I leave you alone? But... you know that... evil ghosts inside want to kill us. I didn't think that much. Mr. Pan! let me hold you up. Come on. I am sorry Mr. Pan. It is me that caused all the trouble. Run! Run! Quickly! Run! Run! Quickly! It's all right. It's also. my business. Muqing! Mr. Pan! Are you all right? I am sorry. Don't blame me. I should have thought of you. Only you know me so well. Only you know me so well. Why do you do this to us? If it is not your dad, my son... wouldn't die. He died in the dormitory of the construction site. Do you know it? I don't know. Awei is a fine kid. I was waiting for him to have dinner at home. But... he didn't come back ever again. It is a haunted place... that can't be touched. But your father wouldn't listen. He dug coffins out. in order to make money. He moved the door of death... so that the evil ghosts came to revenge. Awei was ruined by the evil ghost... without full corpse. Now the karma has arrived. Your father... was finally in the hospital. But it is not enough. My son died. His daughter should not live either. All your... scheme was... for revenge. Yes. Finally this day has come. Awei I have taken revenge for you. Awei I 'have taken revenge for you. Stop. Stop. Stop. I know you are inside. There is no way out. I can find you in this place... even with my eyes closed. Come out. Come out. Stop Don't run. Stop! hello 120. Dad! do you still remember... how eight coffins... were dug out? Of course. I remember. It was Acheng who brought people to dig them out. Acheng? It was Zhangcheng of our company. I heard the project was haunted. The two people who dug out the coffins were died. Then it was said... that eight coffins... offended the ghosts. What were their names? There was one whose last name is Pan. He died in the dormitory of construction site. He was died without recognition. I can't remember... the other one. He dided without any reason by the sea. When he was found... the corpse was rotten. People were in panic that time. I managed to hold on... under all that pressure. Now, everything is OK. We see the sunrise through clouds. my girl! I should thank you for the period... that I am in the hospital. The cinema is going to open tomorrow. You have made so much effort. Dad. You can ask Zhangcheng about it. He knows everything. Zhagncheng. I would... like to extend my gratitude to... like to extend my gratitude to... all distinguished guests on the behalf of Yu's Group. Meanwhile, I would also like to thank... people who contribute to... the construction of... Xinhua International... Cinema. Our cinema... is a place to spread culture.

I am really looking forward of seeing it. Let's watch it here then. All right. Huashengdou Did you smell it? What Petrol Again? Didn't I tell you that it is the smell of oil paint instead of petrol That's not right. The decoration was down several months ago. Where does the smell of oil paint come from?
