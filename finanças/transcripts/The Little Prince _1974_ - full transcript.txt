This is suicide, don't you understand? Suicide. Then maybe I won't have to find my friend The Snake. - What are you saying? - It doesn't matter. It does matter. What snake? I'll tell you about him later. - Tell me now. - You can't draw while you're walking. The stars are beautiful because of a flower I can't see. Why is the desert So lovely to see? Why is the desert So lovely to see? There is a reason Lovely to tell Because the desert Is hiding a well What makes the desert So lovely at night? What makes the desert So lovely at night? Millions of reasons Tell me just one At night, the desert Is hiding the sun Look! Look! It's water. Why am I happy? We're dying of thirst Why am I happy? We're dying of thirst - Why are you happy? - Why do you think? Because there's plenty Of water to drink Why was the desert So lovely before? Why was it lovely But not anymore? Water was hiding No one could see But now the water Is hiding in me - You mustrt forget your promise. - What promise? You know, a muzzle for my sheep. I won't forget. But first, I want to hear more about that snake. - Now? - Now. Very well, then. I met him in a tree at the edge of the desert, not far from here. There are some hills here. He was the first real person I met when I landed here. And until I met someone else, I thought everyone on Earth was a snake. I arrived on the other side of the tree. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. You're talking to the wrong end. You're a funny animal. You're nothing but a tail. Where's the rest? - I'm not an animal. - What are you? What am I? I'm a snake. - I'm enchanted. - Well, you should be. You're all cold and slimy. Thank you. It runs in the family. Could you tell me what I've landed on? Yes. This sunny section of the solar system is called the Sahara. The name of this planet is Sahara? No, no, no, no. This simmering spot of singing sand is called the Sahara. The whole silly, stupid, smelly sphere is called the Earth. Oh, good. I thought I'd come to the wrong place. Oh, you have. Listen. You look like a nice fellow. Why don't you take off your sword and stay a while. You seem like a smart, sensible sort. Why did you swing down to this sorry, sleazy swamp? - I'm trying to learn something. - I see. Well, sir, this speck in space is a scholastic sewer. All that you can learn here is sorrow. Sorrow. If I were you, I'd scram. I can't, my flock of birds have flown away. - So? - They brought me here. I see. Listen, you are so lucky that you met me. Why am I lucky? Well, you see, if someday, any day, you want to see your own small, sparkling star again, I may have a solution. You see, I have this special... sting. It's almost painless, and it can send you scooting out of this sad slum and sailing into the sweet, sunny, splendiferous sky. Really? If you would like to cure the fever Called life Get some relief from all the struggle And strife The grandest medicine That I can propose Is under your nose A snake in the grass If you would like a spot Where life never goes Where you can leave your body Home in your clothes The finest travel agent You'll ever meet Is right at your feet A snake in the grass One sting And you can say goodbye To all of your friends One sting And you'll be singing As your spirit ascends All's well that ends So any day or night Wherever you are If you would like to take A trip to a star The quickest transportation Yet known to Man Is none other than A snake in the grass A snake in the grass A snake in the grass If you would like to leave That inuman race And take up residence Out yonder, in space When you are ready To go traveling on Sit right down upon A snake in the grass One sting Is quite enough to make you Happy and free One sting And you'll discover How relaxed you can be Posthumously And while you're wandering through The heavenly blue If you should see the Lord come Strolling in view Go up and say you bring him Best wishes from his fallen old chum A snake in the grass A snake in the grass A snake in the grass One sting. It's almost painless. A snake in the grass A snake in the grass A snake in the grass I'll be waiting. Wait a minute. Just a moment. Are you looking for that snake in order to do away with yourself? I can't get back to my planet any other way. It's too far, and my birds have disappeared. Well, of all the... You... Now, you listen to me. That snake's poisoned you against the Earth. - It's not what The Snake said. - He's hated us since the world began. - It's what The Fox said. - I'll tell you right now, you're not going to allow yourself to be poisoned. Is that clear? - What fox? - The fox I met after I met The Snake. I see. You certainly got yourself mixed up with a strange crowd. All right, let's have it. - Where did you meet The Fox? - In a garden of roses. How many roses in the garden, 50, 100, 500? I don't know how many roses, but if it's too difficult to draw... No. No. Not at all. Let's get every detail of this whole sordid nonsense out in the open. When she finds out there are millions of flowers that look just like her, it will break her heart. Good morning. I thought I was rich. I thought I had the most unique flower in all the world. But all I had was a common rose. A common rose and three volcanoes that came up to my knees. And one of them was extinct at that. That doesn't make me a very great prince, does it? Good morning. Good morning. You're a prince? Yes. I'm a fox. I'm sad. Would you play with me? - No. - Why not? It'll be fun. Where are the others? - What others? - The other hunters. There's no one here but me. Please play with me. I won't harm you. - Then why do you have a gun? - I don't have a gun. - You must. You're a human being. - I'm from another planet. - Arert there guns on your planet? - No. Really? - Are there hunters on your planet? - No. - Any chickens? - No. - Oh, well, nothing's perfect. - Let's play hide-and-seek. I can't play with you. - I'm not tamed. - What do you mean, "tamed"? Can't you stay put? I'm getting dizzy. Sorry. I just don't wish to become extinct. Do you mean, if I move, you will disappear again? - Of course. - Why? You're a human. I'm a fox. I hunt chickens, you hunt foxes. - But I don't. - You're a human, and you also lie. But I don't lie. Then you're inuman. To be tamed... Let me know before you move. See if this clears it up. Underneath the prince, you're a little boy. Just like a million other little boys. I'm a fox. Just like a million other foxes. But if you tame me... ...I won't be like all the other foxes, and you won't be like the little boys. I'll be unique to you, and you to me. - You understand? - Sort of. - Where are you? - You moved. I'm sorry, it won't happen again. I have a very monotonous life. I hunt chickens. Men hunt me. They come, I hide. They leave, I come out. That's all. But if you tamed me, everything would be different. - Even the wheat fields. - The wheat fields? Of course. I don't like bread, so I don't care about wheat. Wheat is the color of gold. Like your hair. So if you tamed me, I'd start to care about wheat Like your hair. So if you tamed me, I'd start to care about wheat because it would remind me of you. I'm going to sit down. What would I have to do? Well, every day, you would come and sit where you're sitting now. You'd always come at the same time. At, let's say, 4 in the afternoon. I could start to get excited about... Oh, about 3:00. If you came at any old time, I couldn't get keyed up. But what would I do at 4:00? - Nothing. - Nothing? Of course not. If you did, I'd get frightened and I wouldn't come out. It's like this. At first, I'll hide behind the trees. Trembling... ...as I do in winter. In time I'll start to feel at ease Show my face And we'll - Beginter - "Beginter"? Get closer. And closer. And closer. We'll go a glance at a time A small advance at a time We'll be afraid a bit And shy a bit Avoid each other's eye a bit Less often each day The ice will soften each day As we get closer And closer and closer We'll go a blush at a time A happy flush at a time Begin to laugh a bit And stare a bit And walk around on air a bit As gaily we grow As night and daily we grow A little closer And closer and closer And then one day There'll come a day A Christmas Eve Midsummer Day A moment when Right there and then We're gonna touch Then we'll jump miles at a time A million smiles at a time Begin to love a lot And live a lot And give and give and give a lot Away we will go And every day we will grow A little closer and closer And closer and closer And closer and closer And closer and closer All the time And then one day There will come a day A Christmas Eve Midsummer Day A moment when Right there and then We're gonna touch Begin to laugh a bit and stare a bit And walk around on air a bit As gaily we grow As night and daily we grow A little closer and closer And closer Away we will go And every day we will grow - A little closer - And closer - And closer - And closer And closer and closer And closer and closer All the time After I tamed him, we stayed together for quite a while. But then one day, I had to say goodbye. I think I'm going to cry. I didn't want to make you unappy, but you asked me to tame you. - I know. - Then I haven't done you much good. - It's all been a waste of time. - No. Because you wasted so much time on me... ...you made me feel very important. But now I feel sort of responsible for you. I should have warned you that would happen. You always feel responsible for what you've tamed. The moment he said that, I understood everything. He wasrt like all the other foxes in the world anymore. I tamed him, and now he was unique, at least to me. And my flower wasrt like all those other flowers, because I had fetched her a screen and put a glass bowl over her at night and listened when she grumbled, and now she was my rose. And I was responsible for her, and I had to go back and take care of her. I brought you a present. It's a secret. So I wrote it down. The last time I saw him, he was sitting in a wheat field. What was the secret? It's only with the heart that one can see clearly. What's essential... ...is invisible to the eye. It works! Eureka! It works! I need air! It works. It works! Wait. Don't. My God. What have you done? No. Don't. I'm glad you've repaired your engine. Now you can go back home. - Yes. - I, too, am going back home. You must keep your promise. - What promise? - You know, a muzzle for my sheep. I'm responsible for this flower. Please. You promised. You also forgot the fence. It's a very nice muzzle and fence. Thank you. You're cold as ice. Are you afraid? Please leave me. I can't. I won't. I don't want you to suffer. I'll look as if I'm dead, but it won't be true. It's just that it's too far to carry this body with me. You understand, don't you? This part of me will be like an old, abandoned shell. There's nothing sad about old shells, is there? My star is so small I can't show you where it is. I'm going back there now, but before I do, I want to give you something. All I want is to hear you laugh again. You will hear me laugh. More than you ever did before, because on one of those stars, I'll be laughing, but you won't know which one. So they'll all be laughing, all the stars. It will be like a bell that's hanging from every star in the sky. There now, that's all. Little Prince From who knows where Was it a star? Was it a prayer? With every smile You clear the air So I can see Oh, Little Prince Don't take your smile Away from me When you came My day was done And then your laugh Turned on the sun Oh, Little Prince Now, to my wonder and surprise All the hopes and dreams I lived among When this heart of mine Was wise and young Shine for me again Little Prince In your eyes Please, Little Prince Don't take your smile away from me When you came My day was done And then your laugh Turned on the sun Oh, Little Prince Now, to my wonder and surprise All the hopes and dreams I lived among When this heart of mine Was wise and young Shine for me again Little Prince In your eyes Where are you? I won't leave without you! Oh, my God. It never happened. He wasrt here. It never happened.
