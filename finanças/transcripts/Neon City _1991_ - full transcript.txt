[static buzzing] [dogs whimpering] [static continues] -Nice dogs. -Hmm. Taste good too. Hey, you're in luck. I just made some fresh bread, got gravy too. -[gunshot] -[woman gasps] [dogs barking] -[grunting] -[chuckles] [gunshot] [men yelling] -[grunting] -[gunshots] [gunshot] [man] Where are they? Get back! Take cover! [man groaning] [gunshot] -[man] Where are you? -[gunshots] Face me! Face me! [gun cocks] You know what? You're empty. [yelling] [grunts] You know you're real lucky. Those Skins would've carved you alive. [Reno grunts] Ah, Red Star. Lady, you're worth a lot of credits. [groans] How are you doing, guys? Your lucky day. Come on! Must get you to town. [indistinct yelling] [woman] People! Where are you? [woman] People! Where are you? Come on, get out. -Out! -[grunts] [indistinct screaming] [indistinct chatter] [Harry] How are you doing? I'm bringing in a Red Star. -Entry papers. -I've been through here before. Yeah, I know. Harry M. Stark, we've heard all about you. Papers! -[Reno] Stark? The ranger? -[man] Ex-ranger. Now he's just an outland bounty-hunting garbage collector, if you catch my drift. Oh, yeah. Catch this. -[grunts] -Hold on. [groaning] Now, she belongs to me, till I make my delivery and get my credits. Anyone got a problem with that? -[man] Sargent? -[man grunts] [Harry] Hmm? -[man] Sir? -No problem. Clear this? Clear. [indistinct chatter] Thank you very much, gentlemen. [people yelling] [woman] It's mine! Give me that! That's mine! [announcer, over pa] Attention, attention, Jericho immigration will not open today. Jericho immigration will not open. [man, shouting] Overlap transports, Neon City. Leaving Jericho. Safe secure transportation. [announcer] All transit passports must be presented at Jericho Ranger Station. Mutants, report to Jericho quarantine immediately. All mutants report directly to quarantine. All Skins are restricted to main floor services. Attention, all transit passports must be presented at Jericho Ranger Station. Mutants, report to Jericho quarantine immediately. I got 357 reloads. They're lead. Ahhh. Dum-dums. You want split heads or mercuries? I'll split 'em myself. [announcer] Jericho housing levels two and five will close to maintain anti-toxic integrity for three hours daily between 0900 and 1200 hours. This condition will continue until further notice. [man, over radio] ...this is Jericho. Jericho Station. Check in, please. [device beeps] [man] Fixable pressure. More. [Harry] Can I get some attention, please? I've got a drop off. We're full up. Now, you make room for this one. Why? We haven't been booking whores for years. -[Reno] I'm no whore. -Oh, yeah? [chuckles] Too bad. I'd pay for a slice. Look, just log her in. I'll be back for my credits. [Reno] See you around, asshole. -Enjoy the bath. -[machine beeping] [automated voice] Attention, Red Star. Restrain extreme prejudice. Red Star... What's the matter? Lose your appetite? Oh, please, Mr. Gary, just one more week? I know. I'll leave and throw in a midnight show for free. All new material. Dickie, you know I think you're the best, I'd do anything for you. Except give him a week. I can't even give you another day. Too many people know what you've been selling out of that little suitcase of yours, Dickie. It's bad for my business. Somebody has to do it. I help people. They need me. Selling death ain't funny, Dickie. Look, I wish you the best and I hope the audition in Neon City pays off. Hell, look at the bright side, the air's gotta be better up there. Say, what's the weather forecast for tomorrow? I know you're gonna tell me. Cloudy with a slight chance of -acid-- -Acid rain! -Dickie, good luck, pal. -I'll need it. [chuckles] Oh, God! [panting] [gasping] [coughing] [Tom] You could try the black market for food. [man] Are you the black market? -Not exactly. -[grunting] Such a nasty cough. Isn't that better? [Tom groaning] [panting] [doctor] That's the last time, Tom. Yeah. Sure, until you need some more cash. Find yourself another source. [gasping] Why would I do that? Your stuff is the best. I'm through with this. Oh, Christ! You got a booming business here. You got people crawling in here with all kinds of diseases. Cancers! Hell... the world going to crap is the best thing that ever happened to you. Quit it, Tom. If you don't leave me alone, I'll turn you in if I have to. Maybe. Maybe not. [scoffs] You ever heard of a prosecutor named Jenkins? Who the hell hasn't? He took both my sisters' kids. Of course now it's Captain Jenkins. Captain of what? Rangers. He left genetic prosecutions about a year ago. They made him head honcho over in Neon City. Hmm. Captain Jenkins. What's he to you? He served papers on my family. I'm gonna kill him. [gun cocks] Step away from the bar, tough guy. I heard you were a freelancer in the outlands. I was. I heard you even went back east. I did. Did you bring me back anything? Have you been a good boy? Stark, you're an ungrateful son of a bitch. But a sight for sad eyes, all the same. [chuckling] -It's good to see you. -Good to see you. -Let me buy you a drink. -Absolutely. It's been too long. Tell me you got nothing better to do than to, uh, piss my people off? -It's not hard to do. -You noticed that. [man] Stark. You got lucky at Annie's. [Harry] Sorry, I missed you. You boys wanna be sure to be out of here by dark. -Now go on, move on. -Whatever you say, captain. We'll see you on the outlands, Stark. That Red Star you brought in, that's a nice piece of work. -[Harry] Yeah. -Torched her own home. Murdered her own parents. -No kidding. -Yeah. But she's out of my jurisdiction. That's bullshit, her warrant's universal. Yeah, but the booking's out of the northern districts. They gotta run her through the courts up there. It's not my problem. It is if you want your credits. What are you up to, Raymond? -Harry. -Where's she gotta go? Neon City. There's a transport leaving for Neon this morning. I've got an escort waiting for it at Astro Station, but he got nobody to ride shotgun till he gets there. Job's yours, Harry, if you want it. I'll make my own delivery. Look, Harry, I, uh, I've got this VIP passenger on board, she's a daughter of this rich prick in Neon City. Hell, I'd take her myself but I can't leave, you've seen the kind of help I've got here. You'll figure something, Raymond. You're the law. You were a good ranger. -I'm asking for some help. -Don't. Harry, if we're ever gonna get things turning... respect for the law comes first. -We can't just-- -No, Raymond! Life and liberty come first. That's what your laws are supposed to guarantee. I did everything I could, Harry. You did jack shit. The whole department sat around with its thumb up its ass while Jenkins was given a free hand to walk all over my life. It had to be done. -Don't say that. -It's the law, Harry. -He was my son. -He was mutant. [grunts] Fuck you and the law. [indistinct chatter] -How are you doing? -All right. Haven't seen you on the Neon run in a long time, Bulk. Yeah, I kinda lost my seniority and I took a little vacation. These windows up or down? Down, man. The fumes will kill you. Dickie Devine? Yeah, we're finally getting rid of him. He tries his act in my coach, I'll leave his ass in the Xander. You better load yourself up, uh, Skins are making some hits lately. Mostly east, but, uh, you don't wanna take any chances. This all the ammo? It's the best I can do. Might as well leave the guns. What's the weather report? Couple of Xander clouds, and one of our people in Astro claims he saw a bright but, uh, no confirmation. -Spend the night in Astro? -Mm-hmm. That's good because my sister is there and I haven't seen her in five years. Yeah, just set it down right here. Yeah. Blastin' some new whales in Neon. You're gonna be carrying some pretty heavy shit. It's perfectly safe... takes a lot of heat for it to go. Bonus. Hundred new credits. -That I like. -[chuckles] [announcer] All Skins are restricted... -Sign it. -Gladly. Why can't I go in the transport? Why do I have to ride with him? You got lucky. So, it looks like we're stuck with each other, huh? And don't bring her back. Killed your mum and dad, eh? Nice move. Let's go, man. We got hot stuff, we gotta pack it in there nice and tight. Don't want anything moving around. Let's go, move it! All right, men, tie it down. Let's go! We gotta get out of here! Now! Careful with those. They're very expensive. They need to be loaded in the front. [man] You got it, lady. Excuse me. -This is the Neon transport? -Yeah. It's even nicer on the inside. [Twink] Please be careful, especially with that one. [announcer] Neon City. Neon City now boarding. You want me to load that bag for you? [announcer] Neon City now boarding. If you don't mind, I'd like to hold on to it. Well, suit yourself. Diesel powered? It's turbo jet assisted. Baby's got a lot of torque. [Dickie] Bulk! [chuckles] Been dieting? Looks like you've down to... medium-gross [chuckles] You know, I'm really gonna enjoy riding shotgun with you. Oh, sorry, Dickie. He's kinda twisting my arm behind my back, so he's gonna ride up front with me on this trip. -Oh. -Why don't you, uh, get yourself a nice seat in the back? [chuckles] All right, load 'em up! Just got a call. Got a doctor on the way out and another woman. Well, we can always use a doctor. Woman got a name? Oh, yeah. Sandy from the Lonestar. I heard she could show you a real good time, if you can afford her. Excuse me. I've got a town to get out of. My God, Bulk! Look at you. -I thought you were... -Sandy, it's great to see you. You look good. -Let me help you with this. -Thanks. [man grunts] Thank you, sir. [man grunts] [man] No, no, no, no. Tie it up on the other side and tie it down good. [Bulk] Harry. When did you get out? A month ago. You two are gonna have a problem? [chuckles] Not me, captain. What's five years between old buddies. He was just doing his job. Weren't you, Harry? Who's your old buddy? -We used to be friends. -Yeah? What did he do? Five years for beating a man to death in a street brawl. -Did you bust him? -That's right. -Your old buddy? -Yeah. Nice move, asshole. Who the hell do you think... [explosion] [crowd screaming] Raymond. All right, everyone. Calm down, calm down. Just some Skins raising hell. You did that, didn't you, huh? You son of a bitch. [grunts] -Nice job. -Thanks, captain. Get him in the transport. Cuff that one to him. [man] Put it out. [indistinct chatter] Good. If he keeps working in the outlands much longer, he'd be dead or no better than a Skin. He know you're here? [Sandy] He looks different. Worse than I remember. He is. Don't do this, Raymond. It isn't fair. I got a whole new life waiting for me in Neon. I need the extra firepower on board. I'm sorry, Sandy, it's luck of the draw. Yeah, well, it stinks. [indistinct chatter] -Keep an eye on him. -Do I have a choice? Nope. Hey, Neon! Wait! [Bulk] Almost didn't make it, doc. Tom. Call me Dr. Tom. [Dickie] Oh, no, no, no. I'll be fine right here. -[Tom] Hello. -Hi. Excuse me, I didn't see anybody there. What's your problem, lady? You're handcuffed. [Raymond] Step inside, Mr. Wing. All right, folks, can I have your attention, please? We just, uh, made contact with Satellite Monarch Three a few minutes ago, and, uh, it seems they picked up a large group of Skins coming down from the north. Now, there's an armed escort meeting you at Astro Station. And with Bulk here, and, uh... Stark on board, you're more than well-equipped to handle any problems you might encounter along the way. But if any of you should decide to stay behind now, I should warn you, this could be the last transport for some time. [indistinct chatter] Hold on, hold on a minute. We're going through no matter what. Anybody wants to stay, the company will be glad to give you a refund. -I'll stay. -[Raymond] Like, hell. [Dickie] Oh, um... maybe I should, uh... I've gotta make my audition. Surely the government can guarantee the safety -of the highways, captain. -Where you been, lady? Actually, I've been in Switzerland for the past few years. It can't be that bad. Sandy? There's someone waiting for me in Neon. Duty calls, I'm afraid. They need me in Neon City. I'll go. Well, then I, uh, guess that's about it. Captain, my father is holding you personally responsible for my safety. Yes, ma'am. Ms. Talaman. I know. Well, then I guess that's it. I'm sure you folks will have a nice, safe journey. Bye. All right, folks, my name is Bulk. I'm here to welcome you to Overlands Transport Neon City run. How are you all doing back there? The toilet's in the middle of the coach. Don't drink the water. Drinking the water is okay from either tank at the rear. And don't drink the water if the filter is below the red line. You all know what will happen. We don't want anybody getting the runs. [chuckles] We'll travel for about four hours be at the Astro Station by five. That's where we'll spend the night. If you need any help, just give me a holler. Enjoy your trip. Oh. Oh, my. A book! I've been saving this one for years. It's the only one of hers I've never read. So you say you have a job in Neon City, Mr. Devine? Yes. [chuckles] Well, practically. I've played nearly everywhere in the States. Well, everywhere you can, I mean. Well, you know what they say, as long as we can keep our sense of humor. [chuckles] Things can get worse than they are now. There's your joke. Things could be a lot worse. Yeah, you could be chained to this. [grunts] [gasping] Give me. [sighs] -Get me a drink of water. -Up yours. Here. It's safe. Yeah, right. Afraid you might catch something? Not this time. Now I know, I've met you someplace before, haven't I? -I'm Dickie Devine. -Sandy. Sandy Randall. [Dickie] Doesn't ring a bell. -What do you do? -I'm getting married. Oh, really? Well, congratulations. Oh, thank you. Say, I've got some great marriage gags. Anybody here got a great marriage? Well, guess it's about time for me to hit the head. [chuckles] You know, folks, I've got this strange feeling that this act is about to go into the toilet. [chuckles] Come on, you've never heard of me? The killer tomato, my famous squeeze of death. [squelches] [Bulk] My parents taught music lessons back in Indiana. Blew the whole area years ago. It's just me and my sister now. Her name is Beth. -Not bad, huh? -Lovely. Hey, hey, hey, hey. That's enough. Of course, Beth likes men who holds up their end of a conversation. Mm-hmm. [speaking in foreign language] -The doctor did it. -Huh? Her book. The doctor did it. That was a childish thing to do. Just-- just pretend you didn't hear. At least it proves the poor thing can read. [groans] [grunts] Ass down. Pull another stunt like that, -you can ride in the trailer. -Fine with me! Pardon me, but does anybody feel anything... unusual? This is Xander. [siren blaring] [Bulk] All right, folks, we're about enter a Xander cloud. Now, let's not panic. We have all been through it before. Rebreathers are under your seat. I-- I've never been in a Xander cloud. You're gonna be okay. Just breathe. Breathe! [Dickie coughing] [Twink] Oh my God. Oh my God! Don't worry, if we stop, take a few deep breaths, get it over real fast. [whimpers] Hold this. [breathing heavily] [clears throat] -You okay? -Yeah. Thanks, Harry. Thank God. But why aren't we turning back? Why doesn't the driver stop? All right, take-- take it easy. You're all right. It's over. It's all over. [sighs] [Bulk] All right, folks, rest stop coming up. Chance to stretch your legs. Maybe some fresh water. Damn water's gone bad. Yeah, I got a feeling about this place. I got you covered, Harry. Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of. [branches rustle] Bye-bye bag. I know. Come on. Come on. [Harry] Bulk, I need Devine. And tell him to bring his case. [Bulk] Dickie, Stark wants you, bring your bag. Come on, Devine, let's go! I need to buy a bag. Sometimes people don't understand. Yeah, right. Here. There you go. I'm sorry. [baby whimpering] [Tom] Just can't leave them, perhaps I could-- What was in that bag you gave him? Poison. That's why they call them "bye-bye bags." Mr. "Law and order" over here just killed himself a family of three. He kills people. And you're what? Just a salesman, right? You make money by selling that stuff? And you all call me a murderer. Right. [engine revving] There's only one thing that could burn a body like that. They got caught outside in a bright. A bright? Yeah. Nobody knows exactly what it is, it's kinda... like a rainbow. [Wing] Think of a giant magnifying glass in the sky made out of tiny particles of water and pollutants. When it diffracts and magnifies sunlight, it creates a hotspot, a bright. Hard to tell... where or when it's going to happen... and how intense it's going to be. Hey, driver. You happen to leave your old buddy back there! Out of sight, not out of mind. Friend's got a sense of humor. Yeah, she's a lot of laughs. She torched her parents. Nobody's perfect. You're a sick man, Bulk. Ain't we all? It's a shame the bastards let it happen. [Wing] Hard to place the blame. Everyone was pouring filth into the sky. The ozone was dying for 100 years. And it would've lasted another 100, if Xander hadn't finished it off. [Twink] What did Xander do? [Tom] His laser experiments blew a hole in the Ozone layer and it just kept getting bigger and bigger. [Bulk] Astro Station. [Tom] We're going to have a hot meal. [Dickie] And a fresh audience. [chuckles] What do you think? [Twink] Where is everybody? What's going on? Where's our escort? -Do you know how to use this? -No. No, no, no. No guns, please. [sighs] Here. Point and shoot, right? Right. [sighs] [Reno] Hey! You're not gonna leave me like this, are you? Where am I gonna go? I'm trusting you. Bulk. Everybody stay with the coach. -[screaming] -[gunshots] [groans] [grunts] [Skin 1] What was that? What did they do? [Skin 2] Nothing. [woman groaning] -[Skin 2] Let's go. -[yelping continues] [Skin 1] I'm not through with her yet. Come on, bitch. Move. Do something. -[woman yelping] -[Skin 1] Yeah. Yeah, that's good. [screams] [grunts] [screaming] [grunts] Beth. Oh, God! [sobbing] Beth. [continues sobbing] [screaming] Oh, my! -[Skin chuckling] -[Twink screaming] [grunts] [Twink crying] It's okay. It's okay. I'm out of here. [Sandy] Reno! [Twink sobbing] Reno! Reno! [grunts] -Hang on, hang on. -They killed everyone. [sobbing] Shh. Hang on, Beth. [sobbing] [Reno whistles] -[gunshot] -[grunts] [gunshots] [grunting] [gunshots] [Reno screams] [gasping] This is what I get for trusting you, huh? You could get killed pulling a stunt like that. Just leave me alone. You wanna be alone? Huh? You know how long you'd last out here, alone? The Skins own the outland. They want everything that passes through it. Your only chance is if we stick together. I don't need anybody. [sighs] Fine. You wanna commit suicide? You wanna be on your own? Be my guest. [Reno] That one's mine! So is the one by the transport. [Tom moaning] Oh, I would've been a... great doctor. Superior. Oh, well. Are you ready now for your open-heart surgery today, Mr. Smith? Well, maybe not... heart surgery now. How about a gallbladder? I feel like a gallbladder. Maybe... Here. Thank you. How is she doing? Oh, about the same. Look at what those animals did to her finger. Bulk told me that she had this beautiful ring that her mother gave her. She's so young. So are you. What the hell kinda shit are you anyway? Why, I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. [door shuts] [machine beeping] [Skin 1 over radio] ...and where the hell are they? [Skin 2] Last I heard, they were still tearing up Astro Station. [Skin 1] You seen the Neon City transport? Cedar said it got stuck in the Xander. [Skin 2] Check it out. There'll be something worth salvaging. Rendezvous at moon rise on the Jericho road, 30-mile bend. We can't transmit to Jericho. And when their friends don't make the rendezvous... But we've got some time. [Bulk screaming] Keep listening. Ah! No! No! No! Oh, God! [yells] Why? I say enough talk. We stay off the main road and push on for Neon City. Let's vote. [Dickie] What if you're wrong? What if it's a trap and they're waiting for us? We've gotta go back. My daddy can wait a little longer to see me. -Back. -There's no going back. I'm with Stark. I agree with Mr. Stark. -You gotta vote. -What vote, jail or jail? -[Harry] Or dead. -Then I'd rather die trying. Neon City. Neon City. I'd say there's enough of your kind already in Neon. I'm getting married. Yeah, on your back in your cheap hotel. That was out of line. Sir. You know, for an asshole, you're a real asshole. You two have something going? We had a son. He was born blind. Had a cleft palate, some other problems, and the... [sighs] ...authority said he was mutant so they took him away. Harry thought I falsified my medical papers to the marriage board. Did you? I'm not mutant. But they sterilized me just the same. [Tom speaks indistinctly] [Twink] And there wasn't any fresh water. [Tom] Okay, Mr. Wing, let me help you. [sighs] [Bulk groans] You know, I used to be a big fan of yours when you were singing. Yeah, well... that's a long time ago. [sighs] You had such a beautiful voice. I used to come to your place two-three times a week just listen to you sing. [chuckles] I remember. So, what's in Neon City? A very... nice man. You love him? He makes me feel good. Sandy... [sighs] Prosecutor Jenkins? He's in Neon City. He's captain of the rangers there. Harry will kill him. [sighs] [vehicle door opens] Looks like we're in business. Come on in! [Dickie] Oh, yeah, yeah. I've heard of this place. Sal Mennella gave it five-stars in the Tomane review. -[chuckles] -Terrific. At least if we stayed on the main road we might've gotten decent food. Evening. Sorry, I wasn't here to greet you. Welcome. He's one of them. [whispers] Let's go. We'd like a fill up and we'd like to order, please. All we've got left this late is a special. -It's real good. -Okay. Sorry, I scared the young lady. [chuckles] You treated him like he was normal. -Some of them are. -And some of us aren't. [Tom] Looks clean enough. [Dickie] I wonder what the special is. [piano playing] -[indistinct chatter] -[cutlery clanking] I haven't eaten like this in six months. Talk to her, Stark. Dickie says you and Stark were married. We were. So, why did he call you... A whore? I have a few friends. They take care of me. I take care of them. I think I'd kill myself first. That's why I'm going to Neon City. If you folks are finished, I'd like to clean up. [Dickie] Thank you. That was delicious, delicious, lovely meal. I've read the books, they were cleaning it up. It's getting better. Hell, the even city can breathe clean air every couple of months. Who is really to blame? Xander was working for NASA. It was their project. [man over radio] Hey, Neon. You didn't forget about us, did you? [Bulk] I didn't know they were anywhere near. Stark! We got company! Do we have to worry about them? No, I don't think so, we could probably outrun them. [cylinder hissing] -Then again, get down. -[bullets ricocheting] Pass me back some ammunition. We got heavy caliber shit back there. Here! And don't give me any shit about guns. Dickie! Here. And use it this time! -Oh, God. -[gunshots] [Twink screams] [Harry] Bulk, get some speed out of this thing! -We are on fire! -Oh, shit! Stark, the trailer! We gotta lose it! We got enough explosives back there to blow us to Neon and back! Reno, back door cover. You got the gun, you cover me. [gunshots] -[grunts] -[gunshots] [gunshot] Devine, grab her legs. -[Reno] I can't get it. -[Harry] Keep trying. [gunshots] [Harry] Sandy! Load this! -[Sandy] Harry! -[gunshots] [Reno] I got it! [Harry] Inside! [gasping] -You okay? -Yeah. Damn. The bright! [Bulk] Folks, we got a bright. Each window has a shield curtain, pull 'em down, put it in place. Stark, get up here. I need your help, right now. Lock out those windows! You'll have to handle the panel. I'll tell you what switch to throw. Number one! Cooling system only lasts for a few minutes. -That red lever on the floor. -Uh-huh. Pull it. Pull it! -I am! -Harry, come on! [grunts] Put your goggles on, now! No, no, no. Keep glasses on, you'll go blind. Keep 'em on. [gasping] Grab the wheel. You're gonna have to watch the temperature gauge. Coach is 130 switch two. If cab hits 140, switch three. Last-ditch emergency, pull the red switch. What's that do? Pulls water tanks seals, 500 gallons on the coach, 200 on the cab. It'll give us about five seconds to get the hell out, if we're not out, that's it. Here we go. [gasps] -[Harry] We're above 140. -Switch three. [gasping] [hissing] [coughing] Hit it! Pull us over. [Harry grunts] [Bulk coughing] Keep an eye out, they could've had some friends. -Come on, everybody out! -[water sputtering] [Wing coughing] -Can I do anything to help? -Yeah, get me some water. -Here. -Yeah, thanks. He's bad, he's... He's real-- he's real bad. I got, uh, some painkillers in there, we'll try to get lucky. Uh, why don't you... Why don't you go outside, I'll take care of him, okay? There's nothing you can do here, anyway. Here, Dickie. Try-- try-- Dickie, Dickie. Come on, just a little. Just a little, Dickie. -Just a little. -[coughing] The doc is working on him. How can we all live like this? If I were free like you people, I'd be gone. Hey, think of a funny one for this one. What's a guy say when he's about to be murdered? [groans] Sorry, Dickie. That's not funny. Bye-bye, Dickie. Bye-bye, Dickie. Bye-bye, Dickie. Let's go. You think you'd get used to it, but you don't. And each time, you lose a little more of what it takes to be human. Yeah. What are they making there? [Harry] Nothing. But it's working. It'll probably keep on working for about four or five thousand years. Of course, nobody can get near it. Oh. [sighs] [inhales] Everybody, come on in! [device beeping] Harry? -It's clean. -[all chuckling] [Tom] Stark! Bulk says he needs some help with the truck! [indistinct chatter] Excuse me. Is this a private party? [Reno] What do you want? Oh, that's original. What do I want? How about, "What do you got?" You stay away from me. Oh. What the hell do you think you're doing? Well, maybe I need your advice, you see, I have this problem. Women say that I come on too strong for them. [chuckles] [groaning] [gasping] Okay, no problem. [grunts] What's wrong? -Nothing. -Reno, are you all right? I guess she's just not used to being turned down. I mean, no offense, Reno, I'm just not interested. You okay? Yeah. You know, I spent all my life dodging other people's lies. You wanna know what really happened with my parents? Foster parents. They had charge of about a dozen of us kids. And they used to rent us out for whatever they could get. And sell us. One of the kids died from a beating that they gave her. So the rest of us just decided to split. And we threw a torch at the place before we left. We didn't think that they'd burn in the fire. Hell, we were just kids. I was the oldest, I was 12. Soon after that, the rangers caught one of us. Well, I told them it was all my fault. So the other kids could get away. [sobbing] And that's how I got my Red Star. [continue sobbing] Things don't always turn out the way we expect them to. [sighs] [sniffs] [Bulk] Hey, Mr. Wing, over there to the right. What is that? [Wing] Cygnus. "The swan." [Bulk] Well, you sure know a lot about the stars. You know, you're a lot older than I expected. Done something to your looks. And I'm pretty good with faces, Mr. Xander. That face was plastered all over for a long time. How does it feel to be responsible for all this? I was very young. I thought I was going to end all war. An intensive fire that can adapt to common laser. You can't fight it. Yeah, well, that's what they said when they invented gun powder and the atom bomb. But it can be used for peaceful purposes. That sure as hell doesn't make much difference now, does it? I am certain it can be adjusted to neutralize harmful radiation we have now. So, what's stopping you? There's nowhere for me to work. The labs I need are destroyed or worn out. I keep looking... but I'm always afraid they will find me. Are you going to turn me in? [sighs] No. They'll just string you up. What good would that do? Maybe someday you'll be able to do it, huh? What a night, huh? Look, a shooting star. -Yeah. Make a wish. -[chuckles] Well? Well, if I tell you it probably won't come true. If you don't tell me it definitely won't come true. I wish that you'd go away with me. I heard of a settlement way up north in the Yukon. We could start all over. I can't do that. What's so great about working in the outlands? Are you in a hurry to die? The Yukon's got clean air and farms, and people raising clean food. No chance. It's colder and it's deadlier than here. No, that's the thing, it's getting warmer. I've been hearing that for years. So, what? Maybe it is a lie. But have we got to lose, huh? But if it's true... just think about it. I say, it's more than worth the risk, finding out. [Bulk] Stark! We could leave tonight. -What, take the transport? -No, of course not. We could walk until we get to another town and get a vehicle. [sighs] You make it almost sound believable. [chuckles] Look, another shooting star. [chuckles] I think it's a sign. [Bulk] Stark! Shit! How pretty! Fireworks! It's the Skins, we're gonna have to pack it up. What are we gonna do? Head to Neon City. [Harry] These guys are gonna celebrate most of the night, drink well into the morning, that would buy us some time. What do you think? Truck's got the power, we lighten the load, we can make it. Let's do it. -[gunshot] -[grunts] That's what it feels like. That's the way it works. Remember, they'll be shooting back at you. Bulk, where's that laser light? Yeah, right here. Power pack is about dead. Uh-oh. Stark, look ahead! Shit! Hold on! Here they come, Bulk! [Bulk] Come on, baby! Come on, baby. One more time. Come on! [automatic gunfire] [gunshots] Come on, do something! Shoot, damn it! Shoot! [gunshots] [Harry] Sandy, load these. I'm going up. -[gunshots] -[bullet ricochets] -[gunshot] -[grunts] [grunts] [grunts] [gunshots] [grunts] Son of a bitch! [tires screech] [groaning] I'm out. Ammo, anybody? I'm out. [Harry] Bulk, get us the hell out of here. There's no chance! Here. Aim at the gas tanks. Push the button, it recycles every two seconds. Go on. -[chuckles] -What the hell! You gotta be kidding. It worked. It actually worked. Way to go, guys! Come on, baby, give me some power. Come on! Come on, one more time, take me home. Come on! -[Reno] It worked! It worked! -[Twink] Oh my God. You did it, -you did it. You saved us. -[Tom] I can't believe this. Thank you. Sandy? -[gasping] -[Harry] Doc! [engine stalls] You've done real good, big guy. You've done real good. We're only a couple of hours away. Leave your stuff, we'll send somebody for it. -How is she doing? -Stopped the bleeding. -Can she walk? -Yes, she can walk. [groans] -Are you gonna be okay? -Yeah. Here, please. Thank you. How is she? I gave her a large dose of antibiotics. Something to kill the pain, but... we better get going before it wears off. Mr. Wing. Mr. Xander, whatever the hell your name is... you saved our butts today. You can ride shotgun with me anytime. Thank you. But now, you all know who I am. -You're worth a lot of credits. -I am. Do you think you can make it to the border on your own? With a little luck, I am sure. Get out of here. [indistinct announcement on pa] [announcer] Screening procedures at 0900. Immigration level three. The numbers will be nine, 27, 34. The letters will be... [Tom] Fresh food and shower, and clean sheets. I'm ready. [machine beeps] You're clear, let's go. [Harry pants] Immigration closed for today, try tomorrow. [Harry] Yeah. Give him my papers. -Stark? -That's right. Now, this woman and my friend here need some medical attention. Gooney to the geg. You're to report to the ranger station immediately. It's in the next building, east. I'll do it as soon as they're looked after. [doctor] Clear. Clear, please. Just put her down. [doctor] What happened? [Tom] She's been shot. Skin attack couple of hours ago. I love you. Sir, the orderly will be right back for you. Go on. You tell Jenkins I'm here. Is Captain Jenkins expecting you? You might say that. I'm expected. Welcome to Neon City, Ms. Talaman. Your father asked to be notified immediately upon your arrival. He'll meet you on the upper level. Of course. These are my friends. Of course. Come on. You go on inside, I'll catch you later. [guard] Captain Jenkins, please. [announcer] Upper level will be open for supervised visitation tomorrow between 0900 and 1100 hours. Mainland transport direct to Mountain Verde will be available for pre-boarding inspection at 2200 hours. [announcer continues indistinctly] What do they do here? [Twink] Do? Nothing I guess. They don't have to. Twinkle toes! Twink, come on up! Daddy! Come and meet Daddy! Hi, Daddy! Here I am! Hi! Rangers. What'd you ever see in being a ranger? Oh, excuse me, Killer Tomato. [chuckles] -Look after him. -[woman] We will, sir. Just sit over there, please. [announcer] Upper levels will be open for supervised visitation tomorrow between 0900 and 1100 hours. [sighs] [indistinct chatter] -You Stark? -Yeah, I'm Stark. Well, thank God you're alive, Raymond called from Jericho, we got a killer on your transport, murdered a doctor, took his clothes, took his bags. We don't have a proper ID but we're gonna get it. I'm sorry we lost her. -What? -Your friend is dead. -Sorry, Harry. -I can't be sure yet, but it looks like she's been given a massive overdose of some barbiturate. Do you have any idea why that was done? Give me the gun. -Give me the gun! -All right. -Why? -'Cause mine's empty. [grunts] [indistinct chatter] Hold it there, Stark! It's a lovely little throat. She's dead! I know. Sorry about that, I just wasn't sure about the dosage, you see. But I'm a doctor, Stark! I had to give the whore something! Oh, you miserable son of a bitch. Sandy is dead? -Yeah. -[gunshot] [screaming] [woman screaming] [gun cocks] [Jenkins] Drop it, Stark. -Jenkins. -Hello, Harry. Jenkins, what are you doing? [gun cocks] You tell your men to back off. Now. Okay, boys. Back away. Real easy. You're gonna kill me? [Reno] Stark! I'm sorry about Sandy. [sighs] You know, Jenkins, for a man who spent his whole life sneaking up behind people, you've lived an awful long time. [sighs] Raymond said you had a prisoner for me. Yeah, she died at Astro Station. You tell Raymond for me? [announcer] Removal personnel to lower level. Removal personnel to lower level. Hey. You want a lift? Climb in. Hang on.
