To die... To sleep... Perchance to Dream... I do not know where I was when I felt the desire to return to this neighbourhood far from the city. Nor do know when it was born in my soul. I know it arose suddenly. As if I had woken from a dream that would have dragged me to this place. Not an instant at night, nor a day in time. But days and nights, months and years. A lifetime maybe. And I have returned, eager to contemplate the tall trees of this garden again. To walk through the heavy iron door that defends it and move down the path of crunching gravel bordered by grass and flowers, towards the old house which stands out against the foliage. Now, by doing so, I feel as if the dream would shatter into pieces, make sense of the fantasy and the illusion bring outlines of memory. This tree was planted on February 12 1915, when Juan turned five. Juan? My name is not Juan. Yes, my name is Juan, but... Am I that Juan for whom one day they planted this tree? Did Juan look at these treetops as I do now, older than the one that marked the date of his life, stretching up on tiptoe, in a crazy attempt to conquer his height? Didn't that little Juan always think as I did that heaven is as high as a grain of sand, as humble grass, as air that cuts a swallow's wing, or the flickering of a star? Did not Juan know, as I did since a child, that everything is heaven, from the earth to God? Yes. That little Juan must have thought of it. Because every minute, in my soul, memory's truth is greater than dream's illusion. Because, like dawn, shadow brings me light. And I am certain I have seen other distant nights from this same grass, towards that same sky that silhouettes the trees. And of having gone, as I go now, towards the old house many times, some with illusion and at others with tears. The house was built in 1915. When Juan, turned five years old. I want to enter. For the first time perhaps? Not for the first time. To re-enter. Can a memory become truth, but not in a dream? And I remember that chair in which I believe I saw a tall woman, sweet and blonde like a golden shadow. A woman who was my mother. How I remember a piano that is now missing. And a music that does not fill the house with harmony. Carmen's music. In this hall the walls were clean. But, were they always? Didn't I contemplate again, in a distant time, this flowery wallpaper? Yes. I am certain. At a time when they grew, Juan and the tree. I am not living a dream. Tonight, I don't know which memories or paths of the soul have led me home. Will you let me stop it, dad? No, son. You can't reach it. Last night I grew up lots, mum told me this morning. But you still can't reach it. We'll see in a few days. Dad, what are the heavens? Dad, can't you hear me? Yes. What were you saying? - I want to know what the heavens are. Heavens, of course. So, you see, the heavens are where the stars, the Sun and the Moon are. No, not that, dad. I mean heaven. The one in my book. This one in my book. Oh, yes, the one in your book. Heaven, of course. Well you see, son... I understand. Heaven... Look, we could say... Look who's here. - Uncle Antonio! Uncle Antonio! Uncle Antonio! He's coming, dad! - Yes. This time we'll finish with France. What a beating we're giving those frogs! Hello, nephew! Know what? In a few days I'll take you to Berlin to know the capital of the world. Don't talk nonsense. - It's not nonsense. The Germans have destroyed the front. They try to, which is not the same thing. Dad, Heaven! - Ah, son, that's right. Well, Heaven... Here it is. Never mind trying, they did it. The German artillery blows all Verdun away. Terrific. More than a thousand cannons firing over the frontline day and night. Dad, what is Heaven? - Can you imagine what it's like, Carlos? Naturally. - You can't imagine. 100 cannons per kilometre, which is a cannon every ten metres. Less of that, Antonio. - Dad, Heaven! Besides, the French aren't fools to respond with cannons. The 75 is the best cannon that exists. And it's French. Verdun will resist. Hello, Antonio. - Hello, Eulalia. Your husband is... You're both crazy. What are you doing there? - I asked dad what Heaven is, but he hasn't told me yet. Parents don't answer to children who climb on chairs. Come on. You say that Verdun will resist but I tell you, it will fall. Like Namur, Liege and Antwerp did before. France only knows about perfumes and fashion. Don't underestimate France. Remember the Marne. - That wasn't France's victory, but a German mistake and they won't make that again. When will you stop arguing about the war? What do we Spaniards, care if the French, Germans or Russians win? Come on, how can you understand? War is a man's business, Eulalia. And men, as far as I understand, are children of women. And women prefer music. Are you staying for dinner? - No, I can't today. We'll expect you for Sunday lunch then. Yes, I'll come on Sunday. Well... we'll celebrate the fall of Verdun. - Verdun will not fall. Germany will win the war. - The Allies will win. God will help France. - Has he been mobilized too? I'm not saying that. I say that if God took up arms, he would do so for France. If God took up arms for France, or for any other country, he would cease to be God. We're a little low on salt. - Yes, ma'am? Did you want something, Juanito? I want to know what heaven is. Heaven? - Yes, with saints, good people. The one from this book. Well... heaven is... The place of eternal happiness. And what's happiness? Happiness? Happiness is... Peace... love... and... I don't know. Your father and I are happiness. See how simple it is? So dad and you are Heaven? Is that all Heaven is? No, son. Heaven... Heaven is something more. Heaven... I'll tell you later. Remind me, Herminia, that on Sunday my brother comes to lunch. You know he can't eat spicy or highly seasoned food. How unfortunate Mr. Antonio is, madam. Such a good person, and with that horrible disease. What's that horrible thing that happens to uncle Antonio? Go back to the living room. But I want... - The kitchen is no place for you. But I want to know what Heaven is. - Your father will tell you, go, run. Are you sure? - Sure! Fathers know everything. I don't think he knows either. Dad, dad! Mum says you're to tell me what heaven is! I have returned in such a hurry that nothing has changed since I was here. The same peace. The same warm breath of a home, unhurried and with love, that I found on my recent return, when my soul thirsted to enjoy the glory of those already distant days. Everything is as it was then. The light shines upon the diary where my mother noted all the accounts and there are little Juan's books who asked about a Heaven he already lived in without realising. There is only one thing new. Yes. That strange brass vase. But no, it's not a vase. It is a 75 French cartridge case. Verdun, June 1916. They shall not pass. Why this bit of war in a world of peace? Potatoes, 50 centimos. Beef, three pesetas. Dad, How many kilos does a quintal have? Well... a quintal has four arrobas. An arroba is 11 kilos and 500 grams. Provided that they are Castilian arrobas. If they are Catalan, they will weight less. You have only to multiply 11 kilos and 500 grams by four and you will have the result in kilos. Is that clear, Juanito? Yes, dad. Today is a great day, Eulalia. - Yes. Now that the war is over we could change this vase for another one. Sorry, but I've always found it horrible. Later on. - Alright. Paris has gone crazy with the victory. In the streets, people kiss without knowing one other and the florists come out to cover the returning soldiers with flowers. If your brother was alive today he would have been quite fearful. Poor Antonio. - Yes. Despite the life he led I wound him up for many years. But the women took care of... - Carlos! How's things, Juanito? - Fine, dad. Please, ma'am, the girl doesn't want to eat. Can you help me? - Wait a minute, Herminia. What's wrong with my little Carmencita? Today is a very happy day, son. The war is over. - Dad, can you give me that shell? No, son, we must keep it as a souvenir. Because today is the most momentous date in the history of the world. The war is over and you, when you are a man, you will live in a world of peace. In a world without hatred or grudges. In which there will never be another war, because from this day on, all men will be brothers. What is the night afraid of? And why does the air tremble? And why are the windows crossed with strips of paper? And why are they dark? Have I have taken too long to return, or is it that nobody lives in the house anymore? Yes. In the office there is a soft light. In what was an office, but now is a bedroom. Why this change? And why do the strips of paper keep crossing the windows? Is there a war? It's not possible. My father told me one night long ago that there would never be war. There is intense fighting on all battle fronts. The war continues... Juan! - Yes? Leave that music, I love it. Leave it, my love. Why don't you come? - Wait! I can't. With this music I desire you more. Either you come, or I go. Luisa! If you don't want...! No. First we'll toast the most important moment of our lives and that you seem to have forgotten. We have been married one day 15 hours and six minutes. - Exactly. To our old love. To our old love. Like the Tsar's Cossacks! Like the Tsar's Cossacks! Life, to Luisa! - Life, to Juan! Don't be afraid. No. Until now they've never bombed the neighbourhood, but if you want, let's go to the shelter. - No, I prefer it by your side, to continue our loving, my love. The Moon is beautiful, Juan. I love its light. My mother said that those who fall asleep looking at her go quite crazy. Are we crazy, Juan? Yes. We're crazy. Because we got married in the middle of the war? On the contrary. For not having done it sooner. - I love this madness. They're getting closer. Now, are you afraid? No, quite the opposite. It would be beautiful to die right now, you holding me in your arms, made one in the most beautiful moment of my life. We have all the time in the world. Remember, we only started yesterday. But you'll be back at the front in three weeks. The war will end before that. And if it's not? What if they kill you and I am left alone? No, Luisa. Now it is certain to end. Don't you understand that this is the end? Who knows? Juan... If we both die tonight? - How? In the most beautiful way, in an infinite kiss. One, only one. A single, sweet kiss of death. A very good idea. Till death. How was it? Once more? It'll be best. Will our children believe us when we tell them that on a night like this we didn't move from the bed? Our children? But we have no child. Maybe because we were married yesterday. These things take time. Months sometimes. Seriously, Juan, we're at war. I want a child of our love. Solomon said something about some doves. Doves will fly to bring us a child. A child of yours, Juan. The garden was always beautiful in the fall. Maybe a little sad because on the trees only their bare branches remain and the ground covered with dry leaves. I remember the wind blowing them in golden eddies up to this side, which was then for me like a remote place where the house ended and that they crunched when you stepped on them, as if they were complaining. But the heart does not know of this pain when it is a child. And then I was a child, a troubled creature seeking love. Good morning, Señorito Juan. - Hello, Margarita. Oh! Hold on, Señorito Juan. you risk your life without knowing it. Hold on, I'm going to go higher. But give me your word not to look up, you might even see America. I'm not wearing anything. You haven't looked, have you? - No. You have the word of a king, son. I don't know how there are women who use this. I'm as my mother gave birth to me. Your shirt's stained! It won't come out. - No. I'll wash it for you before your mother comes. Your shirt, Señorito Juan! Come on. Excuse me for taking my hat off, sir, but in summer everything suffocates me. If you weren't here, I wouldn't even be wearing this. But respect is respect. Don't stop there. Will you give me your shirt? - Yes. Careful, you'll lose the button! Leave it to me. This overall is really annoying. You are already a man, sir. Already a man. Won't you come? There are heavenly moments in life that remain fast in the soul, next to a face, a tear or some sweet words. I have always remembered listening to my mother with a sunrise like this, with the wind blowing outside and the garden frozen. But there was in the house a tremor of waiting and whispered words and hurried steps sounded, that any moment went up or down the stairs. I too was awake, peeping out, waiting for something that would arrive through the clouds. I will never forget my doubt as to where the unusual visitor would enter, although I was sure that coming from heaven, they must do so through our illuminated skylight. Then I knew otherwise. I knew it from the sweet words my mother left nailed in my soul and that now I want to revive. The Austrians will cross the Piave as they crossed the Isonzo and all the other rivers. No, Antonio, the Piave will be the Italian Marne. Italy is finished, Carlos. Finished. - You're wrong. Juanito, what are you doing here? I want to see my little sister. They haven't brought her yet. Come on, go to sleep. No, dad. Let me wait. I'm not sleepy. Look, Juanito, five o'clock. It's no time for any creature to be up. My little sister they're bringing is up. Come on, Antonio, tell him. He's always paid more attention to you than me. Oh to see what time women give birth. To die and be born, with the dawn. Come on, Juanito, obey your father. You'll catch cold. I want to see how they bring my little sister from Paris. Children are brought by storks. Did they bring me from Paris. Really, dad? Did they bring me from Paris? Yes, but then, France wasn't at war. Now it's different. Where will the stork get in? They usually enter through the window or the balcony. With their beak they tap the glass like this. And then those inside open up and pick the boy or the girl. Will it arrive soon? - I don't know... It's here, it's a girl. - Wait, Juanito. It's crying. - Hush, son. I want to see her. - Tomorrow. Sir, sir! It's a girl. A girl! And she's beautiful. How lovely, how chubby. Really? Sir, a beauty, come and see her! Now you have a little sister. Are you happy? Yes, uncle, but I want to see her. After your father. He has to see her first. - Why? He has to check if everything is in order and if it's the girl he asked for. - And if it's not? If not... They'll return it and send another. I don't want them to return it, why do they have to return it? Imagine if they were wrong. Suppose your father has been sent a black or Chinese girl. If that was so, your father would complain and they'd send him a white girl. No, I don't care if she is black. Don't worry, madame, I'll be right back. Is she black, dad? - What's that? She's beautiful. I'm going to the pharmacy for something. - I'll go with you. Sir, sir! Don Carlos? Where's your father? - He's gone to the pharmacy. I'll see if I can catch him. Why did you kill the stork? What are you doing here? This is no place for children. Outside! You're leaving! - Leave him, doña Ramona. Come on, son. Let him. It's not right, doña Eulalia. Who let you in? - I already told you to leave him. It's up to you, but it's not very Christian. What's not Christian? It's a lie. Have you come to see your little sister? - And the stork too. Forget the stork. Give me the baby. - Yes, ma'am. Here she is. Mothers of today... Here is your little sister. Do you want to kiss her? She's naked. - Of course. And all red. - That will pass. Why is she crying? - She wants to be bathed. Why doesn't she say so? - She can't speak yet. But I understand her. Now we'll wash and then dress her. Doña Ramona. Don't you like her? The masters had already left. Who let Juanito in? Madame's doing. Leave him. I want him here. Help doña Ramona. But... Hand me the basin. You like your little sister? Alright. Won't you love her very much? If she behaves herself. Now no one can hear us, tell me where the stork is. Nowhere. Babies aren't brought by storks. No? No. Babies come another way. I know, they come from Paris. Not that either. Babies are brought by their mothers. In your tummy? - Yes. That's why it was swollen, understand? You see? And now it's not. Mum, was... Was I in there? - Yes, you too. Mum, I like it better that way. It is sweet for the soul to walk the paths of memory. Although memory possesses sad, dry tears, like those flowers pressed between the pages of books. A dry painful flower to now evoke the love that I lived in this office, when that love briefly turned it into a bridal chamber. And a bitter flower is the memory of a morning in which, in this room, someone made me listen to an impossible music that reached his ear from the cold and thick silence of death. To my dearest parents, to whom I owe everything I am and everything I will be. Carmen, Madrid July 15, 1934. What are you doing? Nothing. Carmen? Yes. Today it's been a year since she died. And what did Mum say? She didn't even cry, which is even worse. 15th of July. It was a happy day. She won first prize at the conservatory. She dreamed only of her piano. It was her whole life. She would have been a great concert pianist. But... But she left us. Your mother is like me right now. Seeing Carmen. The same as me. She'll be listening to the music from her piano. Because Carmen went and left us in silence. She was the music. And we can't remember her without also listening to her music. Prepare to lose her, Juan. What did the doctor say? - Nothing. Because for her illness they don't sell remedies at the pharmacy. Your mother is dying through not wanting to live. She lost the daughter who was her only hope. She says of me that I no longer need her. And you neither, as soon you will find a woman to accompany you through life. And there she is. Looking into the heavens. Learning the way to go with her daughter. To Carmen's heaven? Yes. I suppose God has it all planned. And when we arrive, we will find our own heaven. Carmen's full of pianos. Mine... with a house like this. With your mother. And yours, Juan? What is heaven? The place where we go when we die. And why do we have to go anywhere? Why not stay in our particular heaven? I've been splashed by the foamy waves breaking inside this shell. That's what Ana Mari said. Who is Ana Mari? A friend of Carmen and mine. Maybe my first love. The whole of the sea inside this conch. And all the heavens inside this house. Is that your idea of heaven? If I could choose, that would be my heaven. This house, that garden, you, me. Reliving moments of happiness. And when they're all over? Start again. That is my eternity. Have you not been happy here? Wouldn't you accept this house as heaven? - For all eternity. I have covered this short path a thousand times. My steps as a child took me to my mother's warm lap. And later when a man to the world of harmony that blossomed from my sister's piano. A harmony that awakened with the light and was extinguished with shadow. An eternal harmony. That was part of the air and the love of this house. I want to lift that lid which is to me like a black and painful tombstone, and awaken your sleeping music. How was I, brother? Wonderful. But at first you were afraid. When I went on stage? - Yes. I saw you, my sister, in front of a thousand people. I was scared too, Juan. But when I drew the first notes from the piano it all faded away for me. At the end the ovation was so great that my hands still hurt. Look at them. Thank you, Juan. They are the first flowers my music deserves. They are the flowers that my sister deserves on her first success. My sister, not her music. And what am I more than music? I always knew it, but I understood it today. When my hands attacked Schubert's Impromptu. At that moment I knew what I was born for. Why I exist and the reason for my life. A question I've never asked you, sister. Are you in love? Yes, a great deal. Passionately. You kept it to yourself, sis. Do I know him? Yes. And mum and dad? - Them too. What's he like? Good... Rather short, plump, with glasses, very shy and poor. What sort of a man... He's a genius and his name is Franz Schubert. I need to succeed. Today was only the beginning. Today you've won first prize at the conservatory and tomorrow you will be the hands and soul of these glorious melodies. If I don't reach that height, I'd rather die. You will reach it, young, happy and beautiful. Go on with your beloved Schubert. Juan. - Yes? I've always thought that there are pianos in heaven. And what if there aren't? I'm sure I'll come here every day to keep on playing. Dreams of glory that encouraged a passionate heart to the beat of glorious harmonies and that one night the wind of death swept away. Why is it here in the attic that for the first time I feel like crying? Maybe because when I was a child, my dreams converted their trunks into pirate chests full of treasure. And this room was the castle tower in which I was king. And perhaps, why my heart saw in a girl who loved this attic, its Lady of the manor and its first love. Look. I am the widow of Count Laurel I want to get married and I have no one. If being so beautiful you have no one... Juan! Ana Mari! Where are you? - Let's go. Tomorrow we have to come open the trunks. There are still secrets. Why haven't we come until today? I didn't think you'd like it that much. - What nonsense. I love it. Tomorrow we'll open the trunks, they must be full of stuff. Hello, Ana Mari. - Hi. Where have you come from? - The attic. It's wonderful, ma'am. It's full of stuff. Especially dust. Have you had a snack? Yes, ma'am, chocolate croutons. Well then, play in the garden. Your mother's very pretty, she looks like a fairy. What a bannister! My father's a general in the cavalry. Know what he'd do? He'd ride down. But for this you have to be in the cavalry. Look at your sister, poor thing. All day the same thing. What a bore. The conch! I've been splashed by the foamy waves, breaking inside this shell. How can the sea be shut up in here? Of course I believe it, I can hear it. What a pain to learn the piano, poor Carmen. They don't make you learn piano? - Not me. You neither? Boys don't learn those things, that's for girls like Carmen. Dad gave her the piano last year for her birthday. Lovely lollies from Havana. I'll treat you to a lollipop. What do you like? Me? Lemon. Lollies from Havana. Lovely lollies from Havana. Lollipop! Give me two lemon lollipops. - Hi son. Lemon? The big one or the little one? You're poor as a church mouse. Give me a big one and a small one. Big one. There you are. Enjoy it. - Thank you. Lovely lollies from Havana, Suck then as long as you can Here. - Not that, give me the small one. Take the big one, you're a girl, you'll see how good it is. Thank you. The seller was in Cuba, he fought against Maceo. My grandfather was in Cuba too, he became a commander. Fantastic. I already told you. Shall we play? - It's your turn. You men. When I go to war, I'll become a legionnaire. Don't. - Why not? Dad says legionnaires are all killed. They wouldn't kill me. - How do you know? - I know. I want you to be something else. I'll be a lawyer and then I'll be rich. It's really difficult. - I'll be very rich. We have a factory for scented soaps. Four. Who's winning? - Me. That is how I like it, the women win. When I'm a lawyer, I'll buy myself a racing car. Those that go a hundred an hour. I prefer the Hispano-Suiza. Fine, you buy a Hispano-Suiza and me a racing car. Those in racing cars kill themselves. So what? I don't want you to kill yourself. Would you cry a lot if I killed myself? I'll buy a Hispano-Suiza like yours. Do you think it's OK? That's silly, we can both go in my Hispano. It's better that we go in mine, one would be enough. Yes, but... That would be if we were married. Well, we'll get married. At night we'll put the Hispano in the garden, there. It'll be filled with acacia leaves. - It doesn't matter. In the morning we can clean it. No way. We women do the cleaning. I'll do it. Women have to take care of the children. How many will we have? At least two. First a boy and then a girl. Do you know how children come? What a question. Of course I know. How? - Well... Father and mother love each other very much. - And what else? They love each other very, very, very much, until their hearts break. And then? Then the mother becomes pregnant and the child is born. Do you understand? - Of course I do. And how do you know that? - We women know these things. When we have a child I'll plant a tree. My father did. When I was born, my father said: "When I have a garden, I'll plant a tree for Juan." When he bought this house, he planted that tree. And when Carmen was born, he planted that other one. Why is it taller? - Because I'm older than Carmen. It's very nice to plant trees. For the boys we have I'd like to plant pines. For the girls, weeping willow. Do you think it's alright? - As you wish. Thanks, you're very good. Me? What nonsense. Are you crying? - It's that I'm happy. But if you don't want, I won't cry. I like it better that way. I'm going to do one thing. - What? What are you doing? Carving our initials in the trunk of my tree. How good you are, Juan. I'm so happy I could die right now. I'm happy too, but I wouldn't want to die now. Because you're a man. Yes of course. It must be that. I am the widow of Count Laurel I want to get married and I have no one. Juan and Ana Mari, June 5, 1923. Like it? It's wonderful, thank you. If the lollipop seller came back, I'd buy you one. But since he hasn't... Come. Did you like it? More than the lolly. Here, keep it as a souvenir. - Ana Mari. Margarita will take you home, it's getting late. Come on, Ana Mari. Did you have a good time? - Yes. Enjoyed yourself? - Very much. Will you be back tomorrow? - Of course, every day. Let's go. Goodbye. Let's go. It was always beautiful in the fall. The triumph of the eternal greens and the golden dying of leaves. Why do they still cross the windows, those strips of paper that I saw one night when returning, I don't know how long ago. Maybe they have forgotten to remove them, or perhaps the war will continue. But is such a long war possible? Is it that hatreds can last as long in the soul of man? They're going to the front. Or coming. - No. Returning, they don't sing. When do we soldiers sing? When you march fearlessly into the trenches. Where did you learn so much about the war? Here. When you were at the front line I would lean out to see the soldiers go by, dreaming of being able to see you. And fearing... anyone passing yelling at me: "Ma'am, your husband is dead." And the others, those who went to the trenches, like they were your companions, I yelled at them: "Hi there, comrades!" And what did they say? "Hi there, gorgeous." And you are. Do I seem so to you too? Yes. The most beautiful of all women. Thank you. Are you sure you won't go back to the front? Sure. Can't they change their mind? - They've promised me. I just need to receive the order in writing. So... Will you always be here? - Yes. And in six months, you will plant a tree, as your father did, at the birth of our son. Luisa! Can you feel it? - Yes. I talk to him when you're not here. There are two bottles of champagne left from our wedding, I'll go for them. Don't run. Wait! Juan Rodríguez? - Thank you. Who was it? - No one. A mistake. "Posting to General HQ" request is rejected. Within 24 hours you must join your unit on the eastern front. Within 24 hours you must join your unit on the eastern front. I always remember in this warm and sweet little room the magic answer my mother gave one day to my question of what was heaven. She told me: "Heaven is peace and love." I added her words to this room where one day in November, together with her I created my first heaven. Mum, you seem to be getting fatter every day. Yes, darling. Isn't that bad? No, sweetheart. It's very good. If it's good, why isn't daddy fat? Because daddies don't get fat. The man next door is fatter than you are. In a few days I won't be fat at all. But, Ma'am! What are you doing on your feet? That's not what the doctor said. Either you sit or I will. I will. The broth, ma'am. Is it good? - Lovely. Thank you. I'll bring your shawl. You'll get bored shut up at home. No, Mum. What day is it today, mum? - Friday. No, mum, All Saints' Day. Good... Today is Friday, November 1, 1917. And we are almost in winter. And in winter... - Your shawl, ma'am. Let's see... That's it. Isn't it better this way? - Yes, Herminia. Thank you. Oh lord, if it weren't for someone... Mum, does it rain a lot in winter? - Yes. Almost every day. The baby will get wet. What baby, darling? The little brother they're bringing me. - No, honey. They come well packaged. - Really? Yes, even if it rains. Not a drop of water falls on them. Sit here. No, Mum. - Yes. Come here. With me. So. What will they bring: A boy or a girl? I don't know. Didn't you and dad explain when you asked? No, and it doesn't matter. It will be beautiful. Will you love it? - Yes. More than me? - No, darling. I'll never love it as much as I love you. I love you so much. - How much? To the end of the world. And you me? - Higher than heaven. Higher? So, mum, what is heaven? You and I. The solitude of the garden. The silent loneliness of now. Only the soul remembers a time when the flowers lived with laughter, hope and, finally, love. A love that died. And another sweet little one that sometimes peeked into the heart unable to completely forget, a crazy heart which always waited for its return. Hey! Hello!! Hello! Can I come in? Push the gate, it's not closed. Thank you. You seem to like the garden. Oh yes! It's wonderful! Did you want something? No, no, thank you. But I... I lived here close to 25 years ago and I wanted to see how it was now. Older. Maybe sadder. That's it, older. Are the owners still alive? From 25 years ago? - Yes. No, they died. But if you want to see the garden, you can. Good afternoon. - No, wait. Are the new owners at home? The owner. Now there's only one owner. No, not at this moment. Please... Could I see it? Inside? - Yes. If it's a whim... - Oh, yes. If you don't mind, I'd appreciate it. You'll find it very untidy. There's only me to take care of it. - Don't worry. Exactly as it was then. - No, as I said. A little older. It's like a miracle! Would you let me? Say it. I've been splashed by the foamy waves... breaking inside the shell. Little Ana María. No. Where is little Ana Mari? Here, next to Juan. Just like then. You said it just now. Everything is the same. So many years. We've changed so much, Juan. You look prettier. No. No. Your house, Juan. You don't know how much I've remembered it. That was where Carmen played the piano all day. Did she get to be famous? She died. I'm sorry. The bannister! Do you remember how I used to come down? Flying. Would you dare now? Yes. Oh, no. Not now. Is there no one in the house? - No. You haven't married? Yes. And your wife? She died in the war. And you? I married too. We're separated. We didn't understand each other. What do you do? Live. Juan... What became of our dreams? This. Dreams. Did you plant trees for your children? I have no children. Did you join the legion? I was a quartermaster. Listen, Juan, Did you buy the Hispano-Suiza? No. When I could buy it it no longer existed. But you became a great lawyer. I'm a soap manufacturer. And you? You're going to be my wife. Another lost illusion. Now... I'm a woman. I'd like a drink. Whatever you want. Whiskey, cognac, champagne, vodka... Which do you prefer? - Something that burns. I've remembered that a thousand times and always laughed. You asked me how babies came and I told you. Do you remember? I told you. And I've not been able to have one. Aren't you drinking rather a lot? I asked you for something that burns. And I'm burning the past. What else. Drink up, Juan. When I came here I thought it was to remember some dreams, but it wasn't that. If not, then to relive them. To live them, not remember them. We are no longer June the 5th. 1923. No, we're not. But you've never forgotten the date. It's a very beautiful date. I saw it carved on the tree when I entered the garden. I'm drinking to your health. Juan, let's toast. To some children who were lost on a life cruise 25 years ago. And for a man and a woman who have found each other. To them. Do you realize? 25 years have burned, Juan. Although the garden is still as it was... All we need is Carmen's music. Carmen's music. Very good. Round. And round. And round. Why are you laughing? You see, I was thinking that a young lady might suddenly appear and ask me: "What are you doing here?" - No one can show up. Why, is there no woman in your life? Two. One died. And the other? It's me? Only... through having met again? It's late. Is someone waiting for you? No. I don't have anyone either. Stay then. Until when? I don't know. We'll have dinner together. We'll remember. - No! I want to live! And not waste the night remembering old stories. Come with me out there. There are a thousand places to dine. To dance and come back late. With the sunrise. Isn't that wonderful? What are you thinking? Nothing. Forgive me. My mother sat in that chair. And seeing you... It's not important. And seeing me have you remembered that kind of fairy godmother from Cinderella. No, Juan, I'm not her. I never will be. Come on, come with me. We'll go this way. We'll dance like crazy all night and we'll be back at dawn. I think... - No. Don't move. Seeing you at that window I remembered that she too... Of course. This is the window through which your mother looked at the garden. Goodbye, Juan. There are nights that never make amends. Stay, I'm alone. No, you have your ghosts. Your mother's armchair, your mother's window and Carmen's music. My memories are uglier. That's why I don't want them. Goodbye. Wait. You came to see the house and I haven't shown you upstairs. What's up there? - Well... The bedrooms. Right... I should have guessed. If you want... - No. I know the way. Anything is better than loneliness. Don't look at me. You're wonderful. No, not anymore. No. I want you to remember me as the girl Ana Mari. For you dreams are better than reality and I would like to be by your side forever. And you will be. I know, but in your dreams, in your world of dreams, I'll be one of your ghosts. Carmen's music, your mother's armchair, and this, the curtain in which Ana Mari wrapped herself one night. A night of love. A dream of love. You will never leave. No, I will always remain behind this curtain. No! Don't turn it on, Juan. There are three things that are done without light: Dying... Sleeping... Dreaming. And one more. What are you doing? Can't you see? No, you can't go. I want you to stay. No. Yes, but not for one night. Forever. I've been very happy with you and I want to continue this way. We'll get married and this house will be for us the heaven it was for my parents. I would take the place of your mother. And you? Your father. And we would have a daughter named Carmen and she would learn to play the piano. And we would never be Ana Mari and Juan, but the spirits of the dead. Stay. Yes, in your dreams. Behind that curtain! Ana Mari! Ana Mari! Why is heaven different for me today? And why does my front door look black and hard? Why is that flowered paper no longer covering the walls, that I saw from birth and grew old with me? Why, as if afraid of something, have they closed the doors? And why do I feel cold? A deep cold in body and soul. Are you cold? No, it was only a shiver. I'm fine. - We'd better close the window. No, Elena. Leave it open. I like the air coming in... moving the curtains. And see, and see like that night, the glow of dawn. What a night? One, very beautiful one. Long ago. Before we met? Yes, more than 20 years ago. She was there behind the curtain. Who was she? She. A memory. Have you been happy with me? The happiest of women. Thank you, I also have been happy with you. Where is our daughter? With Ángel, her boyfriend. They're downstairs. Tell Marichu to get some rest and Angel to stay, in case you need him. For what? My uncle Antonio said: To die and be born, with the dawn. And the dawn is already here. Juan. Come on, tell him. Yes. When it happens, have the tree that my father planted for me cut down. It's no longer needed. If one day Ana Mari asks about it, tell her that I had it cut down. Who is Ana Mari? Ana Mari. First she was a little girl, next door, Then... Then she was a woman. Now she's a memory. A beautiful memory. Do you hear Carmen's piano? She's playing... playing. Listen. Mum. Juan!
