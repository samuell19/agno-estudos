Uh, she said the accident occured around 10:30? That's right, we were driving up to visit, And it must've happened just before we arrived. Excuse me, sorry. Does the fireplace work? As far as I know. Do you work? It's so clean. I know. My uncle was compulsive about all that stuff. Before his stroke, he was always dusting and cleaning. Polishing everything. Heh. polishing everything. According to miss Drake, Your uncle was taking a new medication, Tribiteral. She said it made him disoriented. She said she went to the kitchen. When she came back, your uncle was upstairs On the landing? I - i thought he couldn't walk. Well, he could walk some. Short distances. Before she could reach him, He-he must've-lost his balance.

The walls are so thick you can't really hear anything. Really. Monk, come here. You are tired. You're not thinking straight. You're between shrinks. You can't be making any big decisions right now. You can't hear anything. Monk, look. We all miss dr. Kroger. Go home. Get some sleep. You-you can't just buy a house on some crazy impulse. I'll take it. I can't believe you bought a house without telling me. You would've said no. Well, let's see what dr. Bell has to say about it. Why should I care what this clown thinks? He's a therapist. He's supposed to be brilliant. He's written five books and he teaches at Stanford. One minute to go. if he's late, we're leaving. Oh, look. his first name is Neven. N- e-v-e-n N- e-v-e-n. It's a palindrome. That's a good sign. It's not a perfect palindrome. The first "n" is capitalized. Dr. Kroger's name was Charles. That wasn't a palindrome. Was to me. Mr. Monk. Neven bell. I've been looking forward to this. Wipe? Summit creek. That's your brand, isn't it? Uh... yeah. Glass exactly... There you go. Half filled. Or would you call it half empty?

About a year ago. But it's only been bothering you for what? Five weeks? How did you know that? Oh, well, the girl's been playing piano for a year. And it's only been bothering you since Charles Kroger passed. What? no. no. Oh, no. The music she's playing is Chopin. Charles loved Chopin. He played it in his waiting room all the time. No... Maybe the music is reminding you of-of your friend, And it's - it's been affecting you. No. Nah, nah, nah. No. that's... Maybe. that's not- that's just- crazy. it's crazy talk. I mean... Adrian, I know we've just met. But for what it's worth, I don't think you should be buying a house right now. I can't believe this. I think maybe you're buying this property To avoid dealing with the loss of your friend. Okay. What's the rush? Wait a few weeks. Maybe a year. yeah. My-my second wife, she was in real estate. You know, lots of her clients- Can I tell you what I think? Please. I don't think this is working out. I'm sorry. I just don't feel comfortable. And, um...

Hmm. all right. Well then, I guess then we'll just sit, hmm? Do you-you have any with 100? I don't know. Whatever's there. Here's the thing. I'm buying a new house. And I just came from a therapist Who didn't think I could handle it. No kidding. Get this. He said I was moving because the girl Across the street reminded me Of my old therapist, Because they both liked Chopin. I know, crazy, right? His name was dr. Kroger. Charles Kroger. Chuck, some people called him Chuck. I didn't. I had a lot of respect - too much respect for him. Well, he passed about five - I'm sorry. I've gotta go... be... somewhere else. Good luck. Hey, congratulations. Yeah, I couldn't help overhearing. You got yourself a house, huh? Yeah. it's a great feeling. Pride of ownership. Right.

He fell down these stairs. He had a private nurse who said He walked up to that landing. But look. Here, here, here. Tire tracks. They're a perfect match. And this. Wallpaper. You can see where it was ripped away. No, no, I think... I think she wheeled him up these stairs. So you just put that together? Just like that? Heh. fantastic. And this. Tribiteral. It's a new prescription. This is the stuff she said made him disoriented. It's never been opened. You think she killed him? She lied about it. There must be a reason. Hey, Cassie. Jake.

I don't know him. He's onto you, Cassie. Jake, it wasn't my fault. I didn't want to kill him. He would've told everyone. I really didn't have a choice. I know. So how's the new house? I don't want to talk about it. Don't want to think about it. Every 20 minutes it's something else. Something is rusted or corroded Or falling apart or about to fall apart. I can't wait to see it. It's like nightmare except for the Part where you wake up and it's all over. Why didn't you warn me? I did. I tried to. I think we all did. Well, why didn't you tie me down And shoot me in the leg? What's the good of having a gun If you don't shoot your friend in the leg When he's about to buy an old house? Next time I will, I promise. Hey, did you hear the one about the, uh...

Eating your house from the inside out. Uh... it's your decision. It's your house. Go put this back. Just remind me. Why did you move again? Oh yeah, that's right. Your last place was too noisy. Hey, I found this in the attic. Where you want it? You can just leave it here. "fire hydrants to be painted. " Look at this. "more rain expected thursday. " "garden club to meet. " It's so boring. Why would you save all this? Well, maybe - I have no idea. It was before my time, But my father told me all about it. He was in his office right up there when it happened. 1968, the day before christmas. Yeah, I was just a kid, But I remember everybody talking about that. Is that the gate? yes, sir. Three gunmen. stolen milk truck. Rammed it through that gate. They shot two guards and walked away with $4 million. This was back when $4 million was considered a lot of money. Just go on. All I know is, we never recovered a nickel. Until today. From the robbery? Yep. serial numbers match. We got $4,200. A woman named Cassie Drake was murdered last night. We found this in her closet. Where's the rest of it? We're working on that. I was rereading the file. They caught two of the three. Career bad guys. They died in prison without ratting out their partner. I guess he wasn't a big spender. Or he was scared or dead. Well, the woman who died, She was a private nurse. Her last patient was a man named Joseph Moody. Ring a bell? I can check him out. The employment records are in the basement. Take me ten minutes. Good deal. Mr. Monk. I got a confession to make. They really don't call me honest Jake. They're looking for the money, aren't they? Yeah, the old man robbed those armored cars. He hid the money somewhere in this house. 40 years later, he's older. dementia sets in. He starts babbling about it to his private nurse. She killed him before he could start Blabbing about it to somebody else. And she tells her friend, not-so-honest Jake. Yeah, they were probably more than friends. They were probably sex lovers. That's what he's been doing here the whole time, Looking for the money. You're not gonna believe this. He's still not the worst contractor I've ever seen. Natalie. Can you - can you reach that hammer? I'll try. All right, now pull. Come on! pull! There. okay. Now what? Nothing. That nail was driving me crazy. God. What? He still hasn't fixed that light.

Well, he took me to a football game once. Sounds like fun. Well, every time the team went into a huddle, He turned to me and said, "they're talking about you. " Talking about you? They weren't. were they? No, that seems pretty unlikely. I don't know why he would say that. Because one player kept looking up at me And I thought I saw him laughing. I'm pretty sure they were talking About the game and what play to run next. He was looking right at me. Well - I mean right at me. Uh, our time is up.
