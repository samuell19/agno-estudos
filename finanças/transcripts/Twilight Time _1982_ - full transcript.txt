Turn it off. Ana, come on. Hello, boys. Hello. Hello there, you busy, busy people! Anything for me? Boys, your newschoolteacher has arrived! Hey, Americano, let's show the young ladyher schoolhouse. I told you, not much to doin this godforsaken village. Here's the classroom. The world is a dirty place. And upstairs is where you live. There's no need to lockanything around here. This is Lukovo. This is your room. The old schoolteacher died right here, right on this bed. I will send Matan over to help you. He always works with the schoolteacher. And don't worry. He can't speak, poor soul, but he understands everythingyou tell him, and he will do it. Come on, Americano, let's go and have a beer. Yeah, yeah. Excuse me, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Marko, but everybody here calls me Americano because I lived in Americafor a long time. Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, Marko. My name is Lena. Miss Lena. And this is Ana, my granddaughter. Ana, are you old enough for school? No. No, no. Next year. But I have a grandson. He's in fourth class. Big boy, but this year... This year you didn't expect a new schoolteacher to come finish the term, right? You thought that after four months, nobody wanted to teach here. Well, here I am. I see you are here. This must be your first job. Yes. I've been looking for a job for six months since I got my certificate. And then I find out youhaven't had a school teacherfor four months. Yeah, coming, coming! Thanks for all your help! Thank you. Miss Lena, you take two, three days rest. No. School will begin tomorrow morning. Is there any way I can inform the children? Sure, Matan. That will be his first job for you. And, when you get hungry, the inn over there, they have very good food. Thank you. Well, it's nice to meet you, Marko. Please, everybody herecalls me Americano! Okay, Americano. Yeah. Goodbye, Ana. Bye-bye. You're Matan. School will begin tomorrow morning. Good evening. I hope the kitchen is still open. Sure. Take a seat. Miss Lena. For you. Thank you. Excuse me. That's how they do it in America. No wonderhe left America. Americano, I thoughtyou made a bag full of moneyshooting pool in America. That's right. I beat the best of them. How can you beat the best of them over there, but here you can't beat the worst of us? Ah, while you peasants were slaving here, I was living like a gentleman. Oh, sure. What I want to know is where you hide all that American money. Your mattress? Or under a pile of donkey shit? They are worse than peasants, they are pigs. Marko, you're grandson iscoming in to take you home. I'm coming, I'm coming. Ivan, I... I want you to meet Miss Lena, the new school teacher. Come on. Good night, Miss Lena. Good night, pigs. Marko, Marko. Oh! Pick it up. And don't spend it. I'll be back tomorrow. Sure. Come on. Every time you goto the bus for mail, you end up at the inn. Ah, now, don't be angry with me. The day we get a letter, I'll come running back as fast as lightning. I saw you paying off Pashko. How much did you lose? None of your business. Why didn't you say hello to the new schoolteacher when I introduced you? You see what the children have brought for me? You've really made me feel welcome. Everything's fine, Matan. I don't need a thing. Thank you. Well, now... Children, since our class is so small, wouldn't it be nice if we all sat together down in front? Yes? This is where we're all supposed to sit. You know, according to the class we are in. Oh, of course. I've never been in a one room. I mean, this is my first time that I've... Let's see, first classwe have Vlatko and Vladimir. Now, who is Vlatko and who is Vladimir? I'm Vlatk... Vladimir. I'm Vlatko. Now, in the second class, we have Aldo. And in the third class, we have Vera. Vera, you're the third class. And, in the fourth class, we have Ivan, Helenaand Milan. Five, six. Who is missing, Helena? Ivan isn't here. Thank you. More lime, Ivan. Good afternoon. A lot of work on the farm, isn't there, Americano? Yeah, yeah. We are mixing limeto paint the house. How was school? The first day of school went very well, thank you. I must tell you. I was hoping they would notsend another schoolteacherfor two or three months, because, you see, everybody's needed in the fields this time of the year. Old people can't work big farms like this all by themselves. You ever live on a farm? One summer when I was a little girl, I did. You did? Ivan! Ivan. Oh, come here, my boy! Oh, let him be. We'll have plenty of timeto get to know each other. Oh, he's a hard worker, my grandson. He does the job of two men. You know, my legs are stiff. You don't mind walking, do you? No. Ivan doesn't liketo see me carry a stick, but I feel safer with it. For 20 years in America, I dreamed about this place. Look at those vineyards. Did you know our vineyards are famous? Very famous. We make excellent wine. I made enough in Americato keep me happy till I die. But those children, those poor children. Two years ago, their parents left to goto work in Germany. My son too, and his wife, my daughter-in-law. We haven't heard from themin three months. Nothing! Would you believe that? Nothing. No postcard, nothing. Did you know that Ivan didn't come to school this morning? No school never helped me. And I did everything. I started by workingas a railroad worker. For 10 years, I moved fromplace to place. I lived inshacks and I worked. I worked hard. And then, I finallysettled down in Indiana, in a clothing factory. And there, I became a foreman. So you see, I was my own master. What did school do for me? Nothing. I did it all by myself. Times were different then. Yeah, I know, I know. We have to help them. There's another way of life, you know. Maybe you are right. I know I'm right. I hope I didn't upset you. You didn't. Beautiful. I'd like to see Ivan in school tomorrow. Better leave the potatoes, Grandpa. Why? I can do it. You can do it. But you're throwing away half the potatoes with the peelings. Enough to feed a family of pigs. Ivan, look what I've got. Five flies. Can you catch five flies? Ana, don't botheryour brother. Why waste time doing that? Put the chickens inside. Oh, no. I don't know, I don't know, Ivan. What don't you know? I'm just a little confused, that's all. Getting old? No, I had a talk with the schoolteacher. I know. Tomorrow you are going to school. School can wait. I've too much work to do. All that wood to cut. No, no, my boy. Work can wait. After school, you and I can go out together and cut the wood. I'll do it. You shouldn't be doing things like that any longer. I cut wood before you were born. How? Like you cut potatoes? Ivan! Come here. Why aren't you in school today? I took the milk to be sold. Why doesn't your grandfathertake the milk to be sold? That's woman's work! Stop it! Let me go. It isn't easy for Ivan. As if we weren't busy too! It's especially hard for Ivan. There's no woman in the house. Go back to your work. Ivan, will you help me with the desk? I'm not finished. What happened? You're not getting married, are you? Push, pull, push, pull, push, pull. Fill the whole page. Push, pull, push, pull. Push, pull, that's it. This year you must learn all the letters. Well, we have two rows of vegetables and we'll get... We'll buy insecticide for the vineyards. Make sure you add it up right, my boy. Can't be short, you know. If you didn't shootpool and drink, we'd never be short. It's my own money I'm spending. We must save. Papa and Mama haven't sentanything for a long time. Save, save, save. Always the same damned story! Ivan, come on. Come on, let's have a game. Grandpa, can I play? No, no, no, no. You must fill the full page. Push, pull, push, pull, push. Come on. Who goes first? I go first. Busy as ever, I see. Don't you guys ever relax? Hey, Americano, you've got your letter from Germany. What do they say? What about the game? Later. Marko, what a surprise. Have you come to enroll? Please, come in. I've brought you some of our fresh honey. It's the healthiest thing. I'll bet you've never tasted anything like this in your whole life. How nice. Thank you. Please, sit. How are things going? Okay? Everything's going great. Thanks. That's Abba. Who? A group called Abba. They're pop singers. Two men, two women. They're Swedish and very good. May I offer you a glass of brandy? Yes, thank you. Abba. Two men, two women. In my time there was 20, 30 piece orchestras. Count Basie, Harry James. Benny Goodman. Oh, Benny Goodman! Please, Marko, sit down. Well, is anything new? Yes. My son. He writes that he andhis wife are not coming homefor the Spring Festival. Oh, how disappointing. In three months, we did not get onesingle word from them. In two years they nevercame home once. And now, now he writes that he and his wifeare not living togetheranymore. He found himself a German girl, and she found herselfa better job in Hamburg. And I don't knowhow to tell this to Ivan. What do I tell him? Maybe it's not as serious as you think. People quarrel and make up even in the best of marriages. But, you see, everything I make in America, I put in that farm. I worked for my children! What do they want, going off, working abroad like that? Leaving those poor children. You see, the family is important, too. I'm sorry. Oh, please, don't be sorry. It is hard to know what to do. I only came here to ask youfor a piece of paper to write. Of course. One. Oh, take two or three, please. Thank you. I came here to ask for a piece of paper, instead I openedmy big mouth. Don't worry, Marko, everything is going to be all right. I hope you are right. Look! Look what I got from Germany. "Dear Papa, Ivan and Ana, we have been working so hard." Let me, let meread this for you. "Dear Papa, Ivan and Ana, "we have been working so hard "we have not been ableto write sooner, "but we are alwaysthinking of you, "especially of ourdear, little Ana. "We are counting the daysuntil we can come home. "Money is important, but it is not everythingin life." Aha! See? "When you live abroad, you are always a foreigner "and you soon realize thatthere is no place like home, among your own people. "Grandpa knows thatbetter than anyone. "He spent half his lifein America, "and could have stayed thereif only he wanted to makemore money..." When are Mama and Papa coming? "He could have stayed thereif he only wanted to make moremoney, but..." When are they coming? When? Wait. "He came home. "My dearest children, "we will do our best "to be backfor the Spring Festival." When's that Grandpa? Listen, Ana. "All our love, Mama and Papa." When's the Spring Fest... Fest... Festival. Festival. Spring Festival. Don't you remember, eh? From last year? The blessing of the vines? The singing and the dancingin the squares? I remember. Where's the money? Where's the money? Where's the money? Where's the money? You are always the money. Think, my boy. It'll be saferif they bring it with themwhen they come, huh? Use your head. I've finished my side. Hurry up, Grandpa. Mama and Papa will be home before you've finished your wall. The movie's coming! Tony asked you to come right now. Okay. One minute. Hurry up, Grandpa! Hurry up! Hurry up! How long have you been luxuriating in this paradise? A month. I knew the old schoolteacher. Poor guy died without hisone wish coming true. To get the hell out of Lukovo. Sorry about the mess I'm going to make, but this is the only place in town where you can show films. It's okay. What time does the picture start? 7:00, Pashko. 7:00. 7:00, boys! I'm the only game in town, except for pool. Can't even have televisionin these mountains. Shall we go andhave a drink? Just to get to knoweach other. I don't drink. What about going outfor a walk after the movieif there's a moon? Do you talk to every girl like this? Not every. Matan, you canleave that tilltomorrow morning. Be careful. How did you get stuck in this village? Just old people and children. Somebody's gotto teach the children. Many villages have no teacher at all. I don't believeyou're happy here. Aren't you lonely? I'm used to loneliness. Used to it? How can you get used to it? My mother and father got a divorce when I was still a very little girl, and I ended up living with my grandparents. I had a room alone in college. You can get used to loneliness like anything else. I'm not lonely when I'm with the children. Take it to the truck and then go home. Well... Goodbye, Miss. Nice meeting you. Goodbye, Tony. That damned truck! The battery's dead. What will I do till morning? The inn's closed. Do you want to get rid of that loneliness of yours? What the hell are you doing here? What about my money? Later. I want it now. Here, now go home and go to bed. I guess the battery's all right now. Good night, Tony. Now, you know what that means. Hurry up, there's a storm coming! Get in the house! Come on, come on. Marko! Marko! Everything is closed up! Petar's dead. He fell offa scaffolding in Germany. Poor little Vera. Those goddamned bosseskilled him. No, no, no, no. The bosses didn't kill him. Money killed him! You hear that, Ivan? Money killed him! Greed killed him! Grandpa, the garden, the plastic! Grandpa! Ivan! Ivan. Ivan! Come on. Come on! To hell with it! Come on, Ivan. Grandpa, let me try. No, my baby. You're too little. There will be plenty of sewing for you later. Put on some music. Here you are, my princess. Finished. Come here. Let's try it, huh? Nice? Come on. This is my baby brother. He was born in Germany. Kristina. Have you seenmy mama and papa? Did you find anything out? Listen, you take your sister home, and don't worry, I'll be home soon. Young man, I've made up my mind. I am taking you and your sister to America. Come on, Grandpa, let's go to bed. No, not to bed, to America. That's the place for us. Do you know over therethe buildings are so tall you can't see the top ofthem because of the clouds? Did you know that, huh? You didn't know that, did you, huh? I know that. With my own eyes, I saw a man jump from the top of a skyscraperright through the clouds. And do you knowwhat happened? Nothing. Yeah. Nothing happened. Do you know why? Because he made himselfsome springsfor the bottom of his shoes. And today that manis one of the richest menin New York. Did you really see that, Grandpa? It sounds impossible. Don't say it's impossible. Nothing is impossiblein America! Come on, Grandpa. America is a wonderland! # My country, 'tis of thee Grandpa, you'll wake... # Oh, say can you see Grandpa, you'll wake Ana. # America, Am... Grandpa, you'll wake Ana. You'll wake Ana. Don't wake up Ana. That's grandpa's little princess. Do you know whatshe would be in America? A star. And you, you would be a foreman. You could even be a delegate. Maybe you could bethe president of thelabor union. Mmm-hmm. Thank you, my boy. Grandpa! I've been waiting all nightto talk to you aboutsomething serious. What's serious? If there's another storm... There will be another storm. There is always another storm. There isn't enough plasticover the garden. We can't let Mamaand Papa come and find itlike this. You know where the idea came for the plastic? With my own eyes I saw it... In America! I know, Grandpa! All right, all right, we will fix it tomorrow, huh? It'll take a whole crew, though! So you hire some men from the cement factory. How are we going to pay them? It's a lot of money! You see, I didn't lose it allplaying pool with Pashko. That's yours. No, no. You take it. You take it and hire threeof the strongest guysyou can find. I can't take your savings, Grandpa. All right, all right, then I will do it tomorrow, after I go to bed. Grandpa, Grandpa. Grandpa. Mmm. Don't be frightened. Turn off the light. Rocky, hear the boy. Go ahead. I need a crew to put up plastic covers on our vegetable garden. Saturday, three men, a thousand dinars each. What about food? There's nobody to cookexcept Grandpa and me, and Grandpa's not too good. Where is your wife? Fifteen hundred or no deal. That's a little bittoo much. Then do it yourself. Okay. We're back in business. Who do you want? Take your pick. Hey, boys! Anybody who want to pick up some cash? You. And you. One condition. Five hundred deposit. Let's shake on it. Come on, let's go. Got a cigarette? Goodbye, kid. Bye. Oh, Ivan. You finally showed up. Come in. Good afternoon, Miss Lena. Good afternoon. Why weren't you in schooltoday? I was busy. Sit down. I think it's timewe had a little talk. My parents wrote that they were coming for the festival. They are. We've got to put the gardenin order and everything elsebefore they come back. Please tell me what my homework is. We're very much alike, you and I. We battle to the end and we never give up. You don't have to do any homework, Ivan. Goodbye, Miss Lena. Goodbye, Ivan. Come on, Grandpa, or we'll be latefor Mama and Papa. Why hurry? That bus has never been on time. And, you know, I think someone should be here when they come to bless our vineyards. You're comingto meet the bus with us. You'd like a whistle, huh? Yeah. Don't cut the music inside. I won't, sweetheart. Hey, I'm not paying you to sit around and whittle! Ana, what are you doing? I just cleaned you up. Take it easy, young man. I'm not a young man. I'm paying you to take care of the garden. I'm just makingyour sister a whistle. The garden must be finished today. Okay, okay, you're the boss. Come on, Ana, let's not be late for Mama and Papa. Hey, what's going on? A wedding or something? Today's the day they bless the vineyards. May the new wine be as good as the old. Amen. Clean your shoes. What's the matter? I don't feel well. We'll be right back. Ivan, where's Marko? He's at home. He's not feeling well. Marko. Marko. Look. Oh, beautiful. They don't have anythinglike this in America. If you can't come to the Spring Festival, I thought I'd bring the Spring Festival to you. You are sweet. No. They are sweet. You know what they say? "If the strawberries of spring are sweet, "then the grapes of autumnmake wonderful wine." I brought you the strawberries. Will you save the first sip of autumn wine for me? Teacher, I'm afraid for Ivan. He is more serious than me and clever too. I always felt that life was filled with beauty and happiness, but for that boy, that child... He works, he works from morning to night. Never stops. It's difficult for him, having to be so mature, so early. It's not healthy. Not healthy, I tell you. Give me my hat. I didn't tell the childrenthe truth about their parents. I used your paperto write another letter. You think I did wrong, Teacher? I've always believedin the saying that the truthshall set you free. And I always believed it's the dreams that keep you going. If anything happens to me, you give this to Ivan. What? Make me part of your conspiracy? You just told me, "The truth shall set you free." I understand. Hey, old man! Where is the kid, the money? We are finished. You wait in the kitchen. You wait for the boy. He will pay you. Okay, old man. Nothing is going to happen to you. Now just rest. Mama and Papa didn't come. Come on, Ana. To life. Money. Well, Boss, you've got a professional job there. It won't fall down again. Hello, honey. What's this? An album. An album! May I take a look? Who is this? Mama. And this? Papa. And this? Mama and Papa. Mama and Papa. And this? Grandpa. Who? Grandpa in America. Grandpa in America. In America! And here? Grandpa. Here? Grandpa. He was something, your grandpa! And this? Grandpa. What is this? A dance. First prize. Take a look at this, you guys! "Harvest Moon Ball, Chicago, first prize." Dance! He can hardly walk! Hey, that's him? Yes. No! Him? In the monkey suit? It can't be him, believe me. Come on. Let's go. Goodbye, boss. Goodbye, miss. Come on, Rocky, let's go. And he won a gramophoneas the first prize. Come and see it. Come and see. Oh, sweetheart, next time. Goodbye. Grandpa, is this really you? Did you really winthe first prize? They said this wasn't you. Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa. Ivan, take your sister to the festival. Not for you, for her sake! Ana! Whistle! This wasa happy occasion. Chin up! Marko! What's going on? Right here. Stop it! Stop it! Get off! Get off! Stop! Get off! Sit down. Oh, no. May I have this dance? Leave that alone. I hear something. It's only the wind. Listen, somebody's at the door! Mama, Papa! I'm afraid it's only me. I met Pashko on the road. He says you sent him home. He fell asleep. He was snoring. Ana, darling, why don'twe go up and get readyfor bed, huh? Why do we have bad dreams and not just good ones? Think of something goodand then you'll dream it. Good night. Good night. Ivan, I have something here for you to read. This is the old letterfrom Papa. Grandpa read this to us. Please read it. And please read it out loud. "My dearest Marko, Ivan and Ana. "The time has cometo tell you all the truth, "which I am sureyou have long suspected. "Maria and I have separated. "We quarreled forthree months and nowwe don't live together. "I'll send youanother address soon." Do you want me to stay with you tonight, Ivan? No. Are you sure? I must get to bed. We're already four days latewith the spring plowing. I'll walk you to the gate. Don't worry, Ivan, they'll come home. Good night, Miss Lena. Good night, Ivan. No! Ivan! Ivan! Ivan! Ivan! Ana! Ivan! Ana!
