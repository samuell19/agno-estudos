Good evening and welcome to the great moment we were all waiting for: The beginning of year 2016! From here, Puerta del Sol. For all viewers of Spanish TV. I’m here at Puerta del Sol, but there’s still one thing missing. Of course, as always by my side, my dear friend Ramon Garcia. - Good evnening, Ramón. - Good evnening, Ane. It’s an amazing evening. Come on, give me some energy. - Give it to me. - To celebrate the New Year. Get me the power flow. Ane. I represent spanish tv, to celebrate this country’s New Year. Many people think too much of me. My name Ramon Garcia, was made famous by the cloak, which I usually wear. But it wasn’t my idea, it came from RTVE, which brings together in this building all the national TVs. This has been a particularly important year for Spanish TV, and we do not allow other TVs to get on the air the chimes... of the magic sphere... The chimes... The tower... - The tower... - of the spanish... - …TV. It’s also very large, as Puerta del Sol is. Let’s hear it for everyone, please! And we can continue. I’m sorry, it was a bit of a clap. But so it is written in the script. - But it came from the heart. Exactly, from my heart. With all this euphoria... This is a special night, you can only expect love. You could also expect a better script... We also have to say that there are 25 billion people out there... 25 billion, no 25 million... no, sorry, 25,000 people. 25.000 people are not few! 1000 of them, Rumanian, I think. And it seems that Count Dracula also comes from Romania. Sorry if I… That's ok. I yelled at him from the balcony earlier, "I’ll suck your blood!" You are creatures of the night. To warm up the atmosphere. Even if they don’t understand our language, they're are welcome, along with the Spaniards to celebrate New Year’s Eve. New Year’s Eve, a religious holiday. I can't tell... Multicultural. - Multicultural. The holy week… Is Christmas religious? Isn't it? I don’t think so. I mean, yes, Christmas is religious, Holy Week too... But New Year’s Eve... Yes? We don’t know. We don’t know for sure. I don't think so. Or it is? Christmas is safe, for our Lord Jesus Christ was born. But who was born on New Year’s Eve? We don’t know. The child that my partner is waiting! Thanks for the news, Ramón. And you didn’t even know. This is the first time, that in a broadcast with the chimes of New Year’s Eve a presenter is pregnant while transmitting the countdown. I don’t know if I can explain how... No, it can’t be cut, I’ve said it. - It’s bad, Ramón. - No, my girl. - Yes, it is. You could be waiting the devil's son... But I'd preferred... it was me. - Thanks. With this devil thing we embarrassed Ane, maybe it was better skipping it and... remember the important thing: that Ane is expecting a Spanish child. A spanish child... ready to have a part in the Spanish TV. In the national TV. The national TV. So I say, it’s not the devil’s seed, but I hope he's... I hope he’s an athletic bilbao fan! A Spanish baby in an athletic bilbao jersey. This is my present, I hope you like it. Allow me. Now I look at the size. Oh God. As representing Bilbao, with the accent of the canaries, in fact people do not believe me, but I’m really from there, and so I have the right and the honor to give you, to give your child this athletic bilbao shirt. Oh, thanks! Sure. A jersey purchased by an extracommunal staying in Puerta del Sol, but not celebrating new year's eve, but working…………………. Excuse me! Hey! Excuse me! Hey! Hey! Again: The magic Tower Sphere has 12 numbers. 12 numbers, 12 chimes. 12 chimes. One to 12, like any other analog clock. This is well synchronized. - Not one more, not one less. ...and waiting that moment, we have to find the right phrase to end this year, before the hour comes to welcome the new year. And if someone feels... maybe... - Embarrassed, like me. Lenguage is a trap. Nature is a farce. Happiness doesn't come of itself. - And alphabet is no use. Ane and I wish you a happy new year. Happy New Year, and step forward. Let's go We are ready, Ane, we are already celebrating the New Year! I hope no musician dies in the new year, that’s my wish. I hope David Bowie, Prince or George Michael don’t die. Oh God, George Michael can die if he wants. - What? - It would be better anyway, imagine if George Michael stays alive but Prince and David Bowie die. But it won’t happen. Okay... - Have a nice… - Happy 2016! Come on, don't be shy. There's no light? I'll fix it. Come on in. Follow my voice. - What happened? - Nothing, I'm just... - You broke something? - No, no, no, it's ok. Watch out, there's beetles... Beetles? Don't crush 'em. It's bad luck. Come on, show me where you hurt yourself. The knee, but don’t worry. It’s nothing. Really, nothing. Healed. Are you coming or what? I'm coming... Nice and clean! :) Sit where you like. You were right. About what? This is so much better than the party. It sucked. I would have left if you hadn’t... If I hadn’t saved you. Easy. You're safe here. What's this music? That's Nashira Rasha. Is it on YouTube? I don't think so. Do you live by yourself? So alone. And how did you end up in that crappy club? Let’s just say I crushed some cockroaches. What about you? Well, I... You what? No, nothing. I was dragged by colleagues. I hate going out on New Year’s Eve. Everybody drunk... and my colleagues, they’re not really friends... we drank a lot... And in the end... - Shouldn't you... - In the end what? No, nothing. You know how it works when you’re under pressure in a group of people... Yes, I know. Your name is very beautiful, and very original: Medea. - Thanks. And your name? - Nico. - What were you saying? - I don’t know, I lost the thread. What are you doing in that dress? It’s my dad’s. I thought it was mandatory to be elegant. This is the first time I’ve ever worn this. You're very nice. Thanks. - Do you have a girlfriend? - What? No, no, I haven't. Why. No, but you had... Yeah. Well not really a girlfriend. We dated a few times... - A few times? - Yeah, whit some friends... - How many? - Two or three. - Two or three? - Three, they were three. Whores? - What? - You ever go with a whore? No. - Sure? - I swear. I’ve never seen a hooker. I swear. Never went with whores. Never. Ok, I believe you. Thanks. You know what you really need? No, I guess no. You're lucky, I know. What you doing? Wait here. Ok, ok, sorry. Don't touch anything. Don't worry. COTILLON! - Nico, you faggot, where the fuck are you????? - He flew the coop with the old lady!!! - You ugly wanker. The old lady??? - You going to fuck an old lady??? Grandma screwer! - She’s in the bathroom taking out the cobwebs. - Tell her to take off her teeth before sucking. - Naoshi. - What? Naoshi, the Nepalese goddess of those who were never born. Ah, yes, yes, I heard about it. I saw a documentary. Nobody remembers her story. And what’s her story? Sinoshi, the supreme God, fell madly in love with a peasant. The most beautiful woman ever. The fruit of this love is a child, Naoshi. The mother did not survive the birth. Sinoshi went mad, repudiated the newborn. And disfigured her. Because he couldn’t bear to see his beloved on her face. Naoshi grew up faceless, outcast. But she had one dream, only one dream. She wanted to be a mother. When Sinoshi discovered her intentions, he took her to the mountains and condemned her to be unable to get pregnant. She’s been wandering the mountains ever since mourning the daughter she can’t have. What a sad story. What's that? Conto. A nepalese booze. You really like Nepal, huh? You ever been there? - For a whole year. Cool! As a volunteer or as a tourist? Looking for myself. - Oh, and did you find yourself? - I've been found. That way, I found myself. To strangers crossing their paths. Everything all right? - Yep, just a sec. How strong is it? - What does it matter? They can sell it in stores?! No. Selling it would be a sin. Conto is sacred. Cantaras do that with their hands. Due cento trenta nove 00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,417 - Canka...? - Cantaras. Naoshis worshippers, they are his daughters. - Daughters? - They've been hiding for thousands years in the mountains. - Daughters only? - Only. - No sons? - No. - How is this possible? - What? Well, millennia in the mountains without... You know, without... Cankaros? Right? - What do you mean? - Nothing… how's possible... being so long without... - You think they can’t survive on their own? - No, no… - You think they need manpower for the hunt? - No. - To live? - No. Look... - They need nothing. Not by you, not by anyone of your kind.. - My what? You have no fucking idea what a Cantara can do. They eat your eyes before you even start screaming. - Sorry if I... - Shut up. If you want me to leave... No. I need to go to the bathroom. Thanks. Hey, look… Look, you're beautiful... Look, I'm not here for... You're… hot. -No- You're… I’m very happy with you. It’s too difficult, too difficult... Nicooo, where are you?? - I went to get laid. - Hahah!! - With the grandma? Nico the pussy fucker. - You're lucky if she jerks you - I’m going to have fun, your face I'm going. You're going? Yeah, something happened. I got a call from a colleague who... I have to join them, wish 'em a good year. Sorry, it’s just that... …you don't like me. - No, no, it's not that. - Am I too old? I really like you, but I gotta go, okay? I’m not going, but tell me why there’s blood... - Blood? - The blood you have in the bathroom. It's mine. Yours? Why? My period. Menstruation is sacred. For Naoshi. Your menstruation are sacred? Not a drop should be poured in vain. Okay, but do you have to keep it in the bathroom? I don't know. Is it better in the kitchen? I can't tell... Why don't we... Suit yourself. We want proof! Bastard grandma screwer. We want a picture of your dick in the old lady’s mouth. If you want tomorrow, I’ll leave you alone with my grandma. May I? Look, I'm sorry for… for what happened. If I knew it was a Nepal thing, I wouldn’t have freaked out. - What you doing? - Nothing, I told colleagues I can’t go. Are you coming in or what? Are you getting undressed or should I? Yep. yeah sure. Hey, what's wrong? Go on! Hey! Drop my dick! Bleah! - Hey. - What you doing here? Nothing, I woke up and I was just snooping. What about that? - This? - Yeah. What are you doing with my pictures? I was looking at them. Your grandparents were so beautiful. Why'd you turn it around? I didn't. That's how it was. I’m sorry. It’s been a bit of a rough night. Happy new year. I’m leaving this fucking house. - You said that... - Shhh. - What's wrong? - Shut up, please. Open up! It's me! Are you deaf? Open! Open the fucking door! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ok? - What does it mean? - It's Spider. My man. - You got a man? - Shut up, please! And he's called Spider? Spider…… - Be quiet! - This is not your phone! Who is it? - Shit, the phone. I told you not to... Is there a boy? Open! I’ll smash his skull in! 00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,754 - You care about your pretty face? - There someone inside, you little cunt? Open up! Open this fucking door! I crush it down! You bitch! Medea! Open this fucking door! Motherfuckers! - What do I do, now? - What do you mean? We can't go out! I don't have to. This is my house. But not mine! Not my problem. Anyway, it's all your fault. - My fault? You faggot open the door! Yes, it’s your fault. You crushed the cockroaches, you brought misfortune to the house. I’m gonna go get a gas can and burn the house down. If I go in, I’ll tie your dick! Open the door! Motherfuckers. - I’ll open your ass like a cave! - What if I try to talk to him? Open up, motherfuckers! There’s no reasoning with Spider. Ok, what if you tell him the truth? What? That I fucked a guy? No, no, no, that's not true. Nobody fucked nobody here. - You sure? - I am! What if you just tell him, that I'm gay, I was drunk and I just crashed here... I didn't have the money for the taxi. And you told me to sleep on the... Stop this bullshit! - Spider, listen! - Don't call me that! You need to listen to me, ok? - Yes. - Ok, there's a guy here. - But it's not as it seems. - You didn’t bring him in to fuck him? No. Well, yes. But I didn't. Come here! Tell him! Tell him we didn’t fuck. Come. But we didn't! You faggot son of a bitch, open the door! Spider listen to me! I swear we didn’t fuck. We met at a party. She took me here but we just talked about Nepal. Then we drank some booze she has. Son of a bitch. - Spider, listen to me... - You made him drink the Conto? - Listen for a second. - You dumbass! Are you virgin? - What? - Are you virgin, dickhead? - No, no! - How many girls you had? - 3. - 3? - And 5 whores. - Spider, listen! You go with the first loser drinking your Nepal shit, you bitch. - What? I am a bitch? - No, no, a fucking filthy whore! - Io sono una lorda puttana di merda? - No no, easy now. - You shut up. I’ll show you what a filthy whore does. Now the filthy bitch fucks the virgin until dawn and then some more! - No, no, no! - Yes, yes, yes! - I don't want any problems. - Yes, you do! - No, you're creazy! - Stick your big dick inside me! It's not big as she says! It's a normal dick! Normal? I'm going to stick in my cunt and mouth! What are you talking about!? Do you hear how this filthy bitch enjoys it? - Shout. - What? Shout out! Not like that. With passion. Like that? This virgin fucks me like hell! - Harder! - Harder? More! Screw me, you fucking virgin! She's winding you up, Spider! - I’m fucking your ass! - You’re fucking me! I'm destroying your ass! Oh, so sad. This is normal in my house, maybe not for you. But it’s not a tragedy, is it? - What do you mean "not for you"? - 'Cause you never did it. You're virgin. - I'm not. Ok, ok. Who cares if I’m a virgin or not. I just want to get out of here and go back to my fucking house. Good luck with him. You jerk. What are you doing? Sleeping. - Is this the time? - What else do you want to do? I don’t know, but it’s your house. You could at least see if he's still there, so maybe I could go. I have something to do. What? Listen. Look, Medea. - Leave me alone! Bitch! Bang me! Bang me! Bang me! Baaaaaang me!! You piece of shit. Did you fuck? Are you going to wait much longer? You think I won’t be here forever, that at some point I’ll have to leave, that I got a job and a family? You better get comfortable 'cause I ain’t got shit. There’s no job in my life. No family. The only thing I have is the woman you fucked. I didn't. You’re just a piece of shit. Thinking about a happy ending? That it’s gonna be okay? I'm sorry. But mom’s not coming to save you. And if she does, I'll fuck her! Until she regrets not having an abortion! I can wait 'till you just rot. Until you can’t anymore and go crazy. Until you decide to throw yourself out the fucking window! Then I go bang your ma, you jerk! Could you make less noise, please? I’m trying to sleep. So how’s it going? Did you fuck grandma? - Send the pictures, I can’t fucking believe it. - Made you a cup of milk after you liked her hairy cunt? Come back to the party, faggot. - The police, please. - What are you doing? Hang up, now! I’m in a house and they want to kill me. Yeah, wait. The address? One second. It’s the best thing for both of us to get rid of that lunatic! - All right. Virgin Street, 1. - Yes. Virgin Street, 1. - It doesn't exist. - Try with Idiot Street then. Look, I don’t know where the fuck I am. There is a roundabout and a taxi stop. I know there's a lot... All right. I'm sorry. I call you back. What you doing? Give it back, please... Come and get it. You're creazy. Crazy? Your mother's crazy! Get out of here! - How? - Get out of here! Go home! - I'd like to! - For the last time, get lost! How can I with the madman out there? He need to relax, before... Out of here. No, no, no, wait! Shit. Sorry, please forgive me. Motherfucker. I'll kill you! Medea, open the door! What’s going on in there? What the fuck is going on? Medea! Why'd you yell? What the fuck is going on? Are you fucking again? Open the door! You bastards! What’s going on? Why the fuck are you yelling? You fucking assholes! Let me in! I'm crushing the fucking door! Fucking door! You virgin asshole! I’ll fuck your asshole until your head explodes! You're banging her! Open! Open! Open! Open! Open! Open! What did that prick do to you? Please answer! Amore! Dimmi cos'è successo! Cosa ti ha fatto! - I didn’t do anything! - What did you do, you scumbag? I don’t know! She’s in the hall. She doesn't move. Do something, you moron! - Nothing, we need to call an ambulance! - No, we’re not calling a fucking ambulance. Open the door now, or I… - She's doing something weird! - What’s going on? Tell me what's happening, love... What did the bastard do to you? - Enough! Don't enough me, fucker! What's going on in there? Answer me! What happened? Nothing, you went… you just… I don't know. - What happened to my face? - What did you do to her face? No! Nothing! It's ok. - It's ok. - I'm itchy. Stop it! Stop it! We both need an ambulance. - What happened to you? - Oh, nothing, nothing. You stick some scissors. - And the blood? - What blood? Te l'ho detto che non era il posto adatto per il... Oh, shit. Did he come into contact with your cum? - What? - My blood and your sperm. - Did they mix? - Your blood, my sperm? No... Hell, hell, hell… Shit, what's wrong? Did you cum on my panties? No, no, no, I didn't. Ugly shit face. Can’t you keep your little penis in your pants for one second? Stop. You're hurting me. - There's no way back, understand? - Not at all. Let me go, please, please... There's no way back. What other devilry is this? - Open the door! - It's you. What? No. I'm no one. I’ll tell you what the fuck is going on, God damn it! Yeah, riddle me... Wait. Wait a sec. Do I have to wait here? Why? No! And stop scratching! Wait here. I’ll talk to him, he’ll leave us alone. Okay? I'll be right back. It’s gonna be okay, okay? Don’t worry. I'll be right back. Wait here. Oh God. Ok, Spider. - What's going on? - Listen to me, Spider. I’ve been here all night, Jesus fucking Christ! What are you looking at? Help me, they wanna kill me! There's a jerk staring. What you doing, you faggot? - What the fuck you staring at! - Bastard! I'm not staring! Help! - Motherfucker! Bastard! - I kill you, fag! - he wants to kill me! help me! - Go jerk off at the park! - Help! - Asshole! - Perfect! - Bastard! Fag! Asshole! Fag! Motherfucker! You are the faggots! Motherfuckers! What are you doing? Nothing… nothing... - I spoke to Spider. - Oh, and what does he say? - I explained everything to him. - But you should stop... - I said it's ok. - What? Ok, I fixed it. - Really? - Yes. Grazie! Pensavo che non sarei mai più uscito da qua. Grazie! - It was a strange night. - I wish I had never met you. Don’t say that. I don’t regret anything of what happened tonight. - No? - No. That was the proof, proving that I'm right. From the first moment it was clear to me: you are perfect. What are you doing? - The courtship is over. - The courtship is long over! You drank the Conto, you mixed your sperm with my blood. The time has come. - What time? The coupling in honor of Mother. - What? Mother? - The Mother of those who were never born. Can you stop scratching your face? - Listen. If we don’t copulate... - I don’t fucking copulate with you! I said no! If we don’t copulate, Mother gets angry. Look, I don't give a fuck about your mother. I don’t want to fuck and you can’t force me! You destroyed your face! You suck! Look at you! Look at the mirror! - Where are you going now? - I go where I please! Open the door! Open, I kill that motherfucker! Where are you going? Just because I don’t want to fuck you, my dick is not a toy. I go out! I move everything and go out. What the hell are you doing? Don’t touch them! Spider! This is a fag! - Of course, you need my dick! - Put the barricade back on! What are you doing? Get away from me! Shit, it took us two hours to make it! I kill you! I kill you, for Christ sake... You limp dick! I kill you, motherfucker! Let me go! What are you doing? Leave me, I want to fuck! No one's going to fuck you with that face! - Leave me alone! - I shut you in the bathroom! Open! - Open the fucking door! - Open! Open! I kill you! Once I get in the house, I’m gonna rip your head off and fuck it! I wanna kill you! I'm going to kill you, bastard! I fucking kill you! Holy shit! I fucking kill you! You hear me I smash your ass! Get me out of here! Hey! Call the police, please! Right away, Your Majesty. Thank you! You don’t know what it means to me! You're my salvation! Good evening, Inspector. No, this is serious! Here we have one... a fag who doesn't want to jump. - No! No, no, no! - Easy! We catch ya! - No, I don't want to jump! You hobo son of a bitch! - No, no, forgive me! - Your mother's a fucking whore! - No, no, no! - Stop it, Simón, easy. No! Please, I'm sorry, please! Call yourself, bastard! You dirty rat, filthy animal Scum of life, soggy belly Spectre from hell, damned parasite How much damage you inflicted on me Reptile, poisonous snake, waste of life I hate you and despise you You two-legged rat I'm talking to you Because even a slimy, cursed creeping worm, Compared to you, looks nice to me! Take that! Motherfucker, you and your bad luck! I’m sorry, my love. It’s all my fault. I didn’t want to... What the fuck did I do? What did I do? - Shut your mouth. - Where's Medea? - Why don’t you answer? Where is Medea? - Who knows. There is no time. You must impregnate Medea as soon as possible - The honour is yours. - But I can’t, you idiot! You’re the one who drank the Conto and mixed your cum with her blood. You don't understand, son of a bitch! Everything. I understand everything. No, you don't. The Cantaras chose you to carry on Naoshis' legacy. - What do I care. - No. You need to care... If Naoshis’s daughter isn’t born before dawn... Look, her uterus can explode into a thousand pieces, if it depends on me. You son of a bitch! She's not to blame! I refused to fuck her and she found a replacement! And nothing would have happened if you didn’t cum on my woman’s pants! I didn't... Look, it doesn’t matter. I just want to sleep. Sleep and then, tomorrow... Tomorrow? Tomorrow we'll be dead! We'll see. Ok, listen to me. I’m sorry for my behavior and everything I’ve said. I was insulting. I recognize that. I beg your forgiveness! But the situation is serious now. My girlfriend and I need your help, and you need us to get out of here alive! - Shut up. - I know how you feel now. But believe me, as time passes, - the most important thing is… - Shut the fuck up! What are you doing? I’m going to let you go. I promise. But you just fuck her! Fuck her, please! My girlfriend needs your help. Honestly, as parents, you’re not really suited. I’m not even old enough to be your father but fuck her, for fuck’s sake! Fuck her! I’ll let you go, but you have to fuck my lady! Please, fuck my girl! Fuck her, you must do it. You don’t fuck her, I’ll kill you. It’s your choice, dickhead. Do you want to go home safe? Yes or no? May I? Oh shit. Why is it so cold in here? I don’t understand what you’re doing. And I have no idea how this is gonna end. But I was talking to your man, and he said, if I do what you ask, he’ll get me out of here. He promised me. So, wel... all right. Oh God, no! No, no, no! Leave me! Piss off! Bitch! What's going on? It's a monster! It's Medea! Time for the Rite is now! What's happening in here? You have to complete the Ritual, and the only way to do that is you to screw her! It’s the only fucking way! Screw her... Tell me what the hell it's happening! I’ll explain later, but now fuck her! Open the door, please! Open the fucking door and I’ll help you fuck her! Open the fucking door! Screw her! - Cum inside her, goddamit! - What's going on? Stick it inside and full her with cum! Do it now! She wants it, screw her! Take it out and bang her! Do whatever you want, but fuck her! Shit, time’s running out! We'll be all killed! Fuck. Son of a bitch. Let me go! Shit... Behave now, be a man. You faggots! - Scumbags! - Come now... Just think of something nice, ok?! I can't! Oh God.. No, no! Bitch! - Fuck her! - No! No! No! Fuck, go on! Stick it inside! Shit, come on! Stick it! That's good, son of a bitch. What...? Calm down, my love. Everything went well. - What about the Mother? - Don't worry, Mother is proud of you. We did it. Well done. It had to be, remember? But it's done, Ok. Your dream will come true, you will be Mother. Look at you. You're beautiful. Hey, if I'm not… I'd rather go... Hey! Hey! If she doesn't need me... I'd like to go home. Don’t worry about the baby. I’m not interested in recognizing it. I just want to go home and forget everything. How do you feel? Great! You don’t look well. Maybe you should get some rest. No, no, it's ok, really. Your man promised me... ...on his knees. The time has come. You better save your strength. Why you do that to me? - This is on you. - Spider! 'Cause you're special. Very special. - I'm no one. - You are. Do you know how hard it is to find a virgin these days? It took me months to meet Spider. But you were a miracle. A last-minute miracle, sent by Naoshi. Shut up! I'm not a... Congratulations. What? Soon Naoshi’s sisters will rule. Behave! It should be me instead of you. Spider! Wait outside. - But why? I’m just telling that... - Don’t make me repeat it. Everything is complete. Think of Naoshi, he will reign over everything. Think of the reward. Men will worship you, they will admire you. The women will throw it at you And that, ultimately, is not the essence of everything? - What is it, now? - We need to talk. Come out now or I'll burn everything here. - Don’t you see what I have... - Come right fucking now! You wait here. It’s enough. The boy is pregnant, he can give birth. What? This is my apartment, ok? - What about us. - Shut up or go away! You’re no use. - What did you say? - You fucking whore. - Go home! - This is my apartment. You're the one to go. I was behind this door all night and I heard. You’re jealous because he fucked me so much better You and your fucking Mother... I swear, I fuck you both and then burn the house down! What do you do, you motherfucher? - Go! Go! - Easy. Quiet down. - Easy your ass! - Calm down, listen to me. - Where are you going like that? - Where I please! - Take it easy... - I’m going to the hospital! I’m going to have an abortion, this shit has to stop! What the hell are you doing, you little scumbag? Son of a bitch, let me go! I kill you! - It’s perfect! - Son of a bitch! It's a miracle, Yes, it's... Son of a bitch! Yes, I’m here! Don’t worry. Breathe. That's ok, breathe. Breathe, breathe with me. Look at me, look at me! What did you do to me, bitch? It's a miracle! Push! Relax, breathe! You’re doing great. Breathe. Breathe with me. That's good! Good! Quiet, quiet. Yes, yes, breathe, breathe with me! Push! Yes! A little more, a little bit more. Mother! Mother! She's here! God! You whore! Motherfucker! God! God! I can’t take it anymore! Motherfucker! Oh dear. We did it. I'm here, love. Spider, take that son of a bitch into the living room. Hurry up. Motherfucker. No, no, no! Don't pull you arsehole! No, no, no! Motherfucker. No, you bastard! Motherfucker! - No, bastard, let me go! Bastards! Shhh, it's all right, it's all right. Your ma's here.
