Your husband had several respiratory obstructions per hour, but not enough to warrant a CPAP. At least from the point of view of your insurance company. So it's up to you if you want one, but it probably won't be covered. So he has sleep apnea? Yes. But it's mild. I would recommend he sleep with a mouth guard. You can get one over the counter, or we can fit you for one. It will position his jaw in such a way that his breathing will be unobstructed. Should also take care of your snoring. But I might add that diet and exercise could help with that as well. What about his sleep talking? Sleep talking? Yeah, that's why we did this whole study to begin with, remember? Study shows no evidence of somniloquy. And you recorded him the entire time? Was the microphone working? Yes. But how do you know? Because the technician would have been alerted had it stopped at any point during the study. Where was the microphone placed? - Was it a camera? - It was taped near his throat, along with the other electrodes that were recording his body functions. - It's un-fucking-believable. - Honey, now look... Did he actually sleep through the entire study? I mean, you said so yourself, you couldn't sleep with all those wires attached to you. The report says that he had five hours of sleep. He talks in his sleep every night, and every night it's the same conversation. Okay, I'm sorry. Alex, would you not raise... He's talking to another woman. How do you know it's another woman? Because he says both sides of the conversation, and it's one we've never had before. - Okay, this is kinda crazy. - Stop saying that. Stop it. I'm not crazy. Honey, I didn't say you were crazy. I said this, this is crazy. Have you tried recording it? Yes. And it never sounds the same. Because of that stupid sound machine that you bought me. We got it to help Alex sleep at night. Yeah, some help that was. And how are you sleeping, then, Alex? I don't. I lie awake every night listening to him talk to another woman. I thought we had an agreement. We did. I'm here, aren't I? I thought we'd agreed that medication was the best approach, so why the sudden change? No, I never agreed to that. You've been pushing it on me the entire time. But it can help. And I'm not just talking about sleep medications. There are effective drugs on the market that can help not only your anxiety, but your cognitive reasoning as well. How? By masking the situation? Counseling can only take you so far without the aid of medication, which you desperately need. What you describe to me is troubling. For you, your marriage, your career, your health, your mental state. And there are many people worried about you. Myself included. You don't have to continue struggling. You just need to trust me. Hi, miss? Are you hurt? No, I can't feel my hand! I can't feel my hand! Have you been drinking? Are you on any medications? - No. - Breathe. No, are you a doctor? No. Just watched too much TV, I guess. Sorry. I don't know why I just asked you all those questions. - I just want to go. - Oh. Hey. Hey. I don't know my what... - I don't know... - Hey, hey. - ...what is wrong with me. - Look at me, look at me. It seems like you might be having a panic attack. It's okay. I'm here. Okay. Look at me. Look at me. Hey. Look at me. Just breathe. I'm here. Is there someone we can call? I think my husband is having an affair. Oh. Sorry. Was I snoring again? Where are you going, Ian? - To the couch. - Get back in bed. So you can hit me when I start snoring? I didn't hit you because you were snoring. You really don't believe me, do you? Believe what? Oh. So I was talking in my sleep again. Is that it? Jesus Christ. Do you think I'm making this up? You think that this is all in my head. - I don't think, I know... - Do you think I enjoy this? You think I like imagining that you're having an affair? I don't know. Maybe you do. Maybe you enjoy being miserable. Maybe you enjoy torturing yourself and everyone else around you for no goddamn reason. How can you say that? How can you say that? Every night you accuse me, and no matter what I say, and no matter how many times I say it, you don't fucking believe me! Well, are you? - Am I what? - Are you having an affair? For the last time, no. I am not cheating on you. Have you before? No. Maybe it was suppressed guilt. A secret that's eating at you. Maybe it was a moment. A moment of weakness that your subconscious just won't let go of, and that's why you keep talking. I don't talk in my sleep. Sleep study proved that months ago. Oh, but you do. I hear it. It's as clear as day. And the scenario is always the same. - She comes over... - This is insane. She asks if I'm home, and you tell her I'm at work. We have been over this a million fucking times. Then you start having sex with her. - Why are you doing this to me? - In our fucking house! Are you mad at me because I lost my job? Is that it? Are you mad because... what? You have to go to work every day - and I stay at home? - Damn straight! It's hard going to work every day when your husband is screwing another woman in the home you slave to pay the mortgage for. Jesus Christ. Ian? Fuck. Fuck. My phone. Hey. You're up late. Hey, Nate. What are you still doing out, man? Uh... You know. Yeah, just one of those nights, huh? Yeah. Yeah. You haven't seen her, have you? Becca? No. What's up? Well, she took off. Just, I can't find her. Wait, what do you mean? I mean, we were asleep, I... I woke up, she's gone. - Did she take her phone? - Yeah. She's not fucking answering it. You wanna have a drink? Right now? Yeah. I mean, I know it's late, but... I'm not gonna be able to sleep until I know she's safe. Come on, man. I could use the company. Sure. Fuck it. Why not? - You like whiskey? - Yeah, sure. - Oh, that's good. - All right. All right. Shitty nights. Shitty neighbors. We gotta hang out more, man. - Yeah. - I mean that. You know? I know I always say that shit when we get together, but I'm serious. Life just always gets in the way of best intentions, you know? You guys doing good, though? You still looking for a job? Yeah. Yeah, but... No, we're hanging in there. How are you guys doing? I mean, this past year's been a fucking mess, but, you know, Becca losing the baby. Oh. Oh, man, look, we heard about that, I'm... - I'm really sorry. - Don't worry. I mean, she lost the baby in the first trimester, so it wasn't like... a full-grown baby. Well, look, man, we should have reached out. It's okay. I mean, Becca didn't really want anyone to know. She likes to keep things a little private. I mean, hell, half the time I don't even know what she's thinking, you know? It's like there's this whole side to her that I have no idea about. I mean, I guess we all kinda have that. You guys think about having kids? Not really. Not now, anyway. Marriage is so hard, you know, - why bring other people into it? - Oh, right. Fuck it. I envy you guys. - Really? - Yeah. Hm, never really thought there was much to... I mean... I don't mean like that, it's just... You guys just have your shit together. Well... looks can be deceiving. Not from where I'm sitting, man. Not from where I'm sitting. I wanna show you something. Heard about that break-in the other day on Cramer? Yeah. This fucker broke in in the middle of the night, stole a bunch of shit, tied them up and everything? It's why I got this thing. Is it real? 'Course it's real. Is it loaded? You tell me. I'm just kidding, man. Kind of melts in your hand, doesn't it? I've never been much of a gun nut, but these days? Fuck. Wanna take that thing to the range? Squeeze the trigger, feel the power? Kinda turns me on. I'm not letting anyone fuck with me anymore. It's cool. You guys have protection, right? Yeah. Actually. But... Just one of those, like, small, handgun things? I don't know. We... bought the house, and I thought, you know, might as well buy a gun, yeah? But I don't think I've ever actually shot it. We should go shooting, man. Me and you. There's a range ten miles away. Be fun, man. My treat. Sure. Why not? Nice. Cheers. Sorry. I just... It's okay. Have a seat. What exactly is this supposed to accomplish? Try to imagine Ian sitting across from you. You can close your eyes if it helps. Do you see him? Okay. Open your eyes. And talk to him. Tell him how you feel. This is stupid. Trust me. Talk to him. The floor is yours. He can't interrupt you. He can't leave. He has to listen to everything you say. Uh... Why... wasn't I good enough? Didn't I make you happy? We used to be happy, and what happened to us? What does she have that I don't have? I mean... Not a goddamn thing, but... Just... Maybe it was the bloody accent. Are you really that heartless? You really that shallow? You really think I'm that stupid? Do you really think I'm that naive? That I can't see? 'Cause I see you change when you're around her. That cadence in your voice. That subtle flirting... And that lingering smile, I know that. Yeah. 'Cause that's a... What you got when I first met you. And now you're doing it with her, in front of me. In our fucking house. What is this doing here? Why is there a second chair here? So you can talk to her. Who? The other woman. The woman you think is sleeping with Ian. Think. Yeah. I'm sorry. Okay. Great. I was having a moment there. And... - I need to just... - Now you can have it with her. This is fucking ridiculous. We gotta do this again some time, man. - Yeah. - I'm serious. - I'm gonna call you. - All right. All right. No bullshitting. Some good whiskey, man. Hey. Don't worry about it, all right? - I'm sure she's fine. - Yeah. I don't know why we always fight at night. You know what? Alex and I do the same thing. Must be something in the water. I told her I thought she was seeing someone. Why are you telling me this, Nate? You're home a lot during the day when she is. You ever see anyone come by when I'm at work? Nate, I don't know, I keep to myself. You've never seen, like, a strange car in the driveway, - or someone walking up? - No. I mean, you'd tell me if you had, right? Look, I don't know, I... I don't like to get involved in people's business, it's not my place. But you'd do it for a friend? Yeah. I would do it for a friend. It's all I needed to hear, man. It's weird, isn't it? What is? You get in a fight with your wife, you go for a drive. I get in a fight with my wife, she disappears. Good night, Nate. What were you guys fighting about? I mean, if you don't mind me asking. I snore. Babe. I'm so sorry. I don't know what's gotten into me. I haven't been myself lately, you know? Let's just forget this whole thing ever happened. Let me make it up to you. Hm. God, I missed you. - I missed us. - Oh yeah. I want you to fuck me. - Yeah? - Right now. Yeah. Now I want you to fuck me like you fuck her. - What? - Okay? Just tell me her name, and imagine I'm her. I want you to scream her name when you come. What the fuck is wrong with you? Oh, isn't this what you want? I can be your fucktoy. I can be that, baby. I can be whatever you want. I'll do my hair like her. Dress like her. I'll even talk like her, and then you won't need her, because you'll have me. What? Just admit it. It's okay, I'm okay with it. I'm not going to leave you. I could never do that. I just need to hear you say it. I haven't done anything. But you have. I know you have. You've been doing it for months. And it's okay, just tell me who she is. And this whole thing will go away. Alex. Alex. You need help. You've imagined this whole thing in your head. It's been consuming you for months. It's not healthy. It's making you fucking crazy. Please. Just tell me who she is. I can't keep going on like this. Please, just tell me her name. There isn't anything to tell. Because there isn't anyone. Mm. - What the fuck? - No! What you doing? Getting ready for bed. What do you think? You just, you've been in here forever. No, I haven't. You're just drunk. No, I'm not. So I've had a few drinks. Why don't you come in here and take advantage of me? Bet you'd love that. Why don't you fucking touch me anymore? I do touch you. - I touch you plenty. - Ah, shitting me. You just don't remember it in the morning. Not like you used to. Are we going to have one of those conversations again? Why do you do this every time I try to tell you how I'm feeling? Because I don't appreciate you doing it right before we go to bed. I'm sorry, that's the only time I have your attention. You always have my attention. You know that. No, I don't. You're always on to Facebook or on your fucking phone or some shit like that. And you're not on your computer? Watching some stupid show on TV? I just miss you. Miss me? How could you miss me? You see me every single day. Yeah, but you're always somewhere else. - I can feel it. - No, I'm not! I'm always here with you. You know this. Doesn't feel that way. Well, it takes two to tango, my dear. You are more than welcome to initiate every now and then. That task shouldn't just fall on me. I just feel like you don't wanna be with me anymore. Why must you do this? Every night. Right before we go to bed. Of course I love you. Of course I still want to be with you. Are you seeing someone? Are you? No. Good. Neither am I. Now let's go to bed. Would you tell me if you were? Fuck me. Are you really that insecure? Do I have to follow you around like a little lapdog, is that it? Huh? Do I need to constantly express my undying love and devotion to you? At every waking moment? I just need a little reassurance every now and then. Listen to me. Okay? We had a shit year. Losing the baby, it really... really, messed me up. But that doesn't mean that I don't love you. But would you tell me if you were in love with someone else? Why must you always dwell on the hypotheticals? I'm just asking. Yes. Of course. I would tell you if I was in love with someone else, but I'm not. So it doesn't matter. Okay. I don't know what I'd do if I lost you. You're not losing me. Now go the fuck to sleep. Ow. Fuck. Alex. Alex, what in God's name are you doing? Plan B. What? Plan B? What the fuck does that mean? What are you doing? Plan A was you confessing like an honest, caring person when given the chance. But you are a coward. Confessing? Confessing to what? Plan B is like Plan A, but with a little added pressure. Honey, there is no going back from this. I mean, seriously. What could possibly compel you to do this? Compel me? There's no compelling argument you could give me to rethink this. What's done, is done. Play time is officially over. You're gonna go to jail, do you know that? We'll see. Becca. Becca, I'm so, so sorry. I don't know why she's doing this. She's not well, she has not been in her right mind. I should have done this months ago. Done what? This? Nothing good can come from this! Nothing! We can't walk away from this. You understand that, don't you? You know, this might come as a surprise to you. But I actually know what I'm doing. You have kidnapped our neighbor. No, no. She came over here willingly. You have held her hostage against her will. I mean, come on. It's one thing to knock out your husband and tie him up. But a stranger? Oh, she's not a stranger. Oh, come on, you don't mean... Fuck. And as for you, I was merely protecting myself against your violent, drunken, unwanted sexual advances. I have bruises on my legs from when you threw me down. Baby... And you know how easily I bruise. Baby, you need help. There is something seriously wrong with you. I mean it. He thinks I'm crazy. But I'm sure he told you that already, hm? Come on. There is no other logical explanation. No rational person would do this. Who said anything about being rational? This is about honesty. This is about coming clean. This is about finally admitting what I know has been going on behind my back for months. This is about fucking time. Untie us! Do not let our problems become hers! She is innocent, and so am I! Only the truth, dear husband, will set you free. Help! Help! Help us! Somebody help! Help! Help! Mm! - Mm. - There. That should do it for now. I'm not talking to an empty chair again today. I am done talking to chairs that don't have anybody in them. No worries. There's no chair work today. It was just an exercise to help you confront Ian and the other woman. She's real, you know? She's not just a stupid chair. She's as real as I am, sitting here. Yeah, but your reaction said something different. When offered the chance to confront the woman that turns your life upside down, you fled. It was an empty chair. Which proves my point. An empty chair is not confrontational, it's passive at best. It's a start, it's an introduction into you being able to express yourself safely, but you couldn't do it. And maybe you fled because you didn't know what to say. Maybe you fled because you're scared, or maybe... Just maybe, you fled because you know that she doesn't exist. She does exist. She has a name. Do you wanna know her name? Do you wanna know where she lives? Her favorite hobbies? Her favorite movie? Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Do you know how I know that, is fucking Facebook. I know everything about her. I know that her husband got drunk and she fell down the stairs. Which is probably why she lost the baby. Okay. Let's bring it back. We need to work on your relationship. We need to focus on that. The other woman has nothing to do with you and Ian. Dr. Collins? She is fucking my husband. Are you gonna be a good girl if I take this thing off? Don't make me regret this. You guys are fucking insane. You hear me? Fucking insane! I am sorry that your marriage has issues, but it has nothing to do with me. And you? Keep your fucking voice down. You wanna wake the entire neighborhood? My husband included. Bloody hell, what the fuck is wrong with you? You're dead from the neck up! We were doing just fine until you guys moved in. We have been nothing but good neighbors to you. And this is how you repay us. - I was a friend to you. - A friend? - Yes! - Really? Through everything, and everyone screamed that you were a total nutter. I went against my better judgment. And this stellar judgment felt it was perfectly okay for you to sleep with my husband. I'm not sleeping with your husband. You really think I would lower myself to sleep with this little dickweed? Oh, grow up, you baby. As for you, you are so fucked. Prosecution is gonna be the least of your concerns when I am done with you. Oh, it really doesn't matter what I do. So I broke a few laws. Tied you to a chair and bruised your ego. The public will be on my side. I have never touched your husband. Has he ever touched you? Because I am perfectly willing to get down to the dirty semantics of what really went on, if that's what it takes. So how did he do it? Was it oral? Or did you give him the good old-fashioned? Fuck you. I don't know what the bloody hell is going on here. But I have never done anything with your husband. Or any other husband, for that matter. Then why did you come running over here after I sent that text from his phone? It was a cryptic message! I thought something was wrong! You thought something was wrong. Yes! Of course something was wrong. His wife finally put two and two together. Or did you think it was an intruder? Or the house was on fire? Were you just being neighborly? Is that it? It was late, I must have misread it. I don't know! "We need to talk. I think she's on to us. Can you come over? She just left for a drive." I was half-asleep when I read that. Half-asleep? Yes. I must have misread it. You know how it is. Actually, I don't. Try again. I thought it was meant for someone else. Like who? An old coworker? His mom? I don't bloody know. I just know it wasn't meant for me. Wow. You are both terrible liars. It's the truth! You're practically made for each other. Okay, I'll admit it. It sounded strange, but it wasn't out of the realm of possibilities. "Can you come over? We need to talk." How is that a possibility? I thought it was meant for someone else. Mm, you said that already. It's a weak excuse. Try again. But it's the truth! Did you know he was having an affair? No. So you didn't put it past him when you got the text from him? Maybe. So in your head... Ian is having an affair, his wife is on to it... And this text wasn't meant for me. So I'll just run over and correct the mistake, - is that what you're telling me? - Yes. Then why didn't you tell me? I thought we were friends, Becca. Wouldn't you want your friend to tell you if they got a cryptic text message from their husband that was meant for another woman? I was tired. I wasn't thinking. Bullshit. If you were so tired, why didn't you just reply with, "What the fuck?" and go back to bed? Why'd you come running over here? Because my husband monitors my phone. He would read that text and think the worst. So your husband doesn't trust you? We've been having issues. Well, there must be some reason for him to think that. I have never cheated on him! Oh. Nate's calling. He's called, like, eight times in the past hour. He must really be trying to get a hold of you. Oh, God, that means he's been awake this entire time. Good. Well, if he's awake, let's invite him over. - No. - We can have a real - heart to heart. - No. No, please don't. Please. Please! Don't. You don't understand how jealous he can get. He'll kill me. I swear it, he will kill us all. I thought you said you were innocent. Doesn't matter what's true or not. He will walk in here, see this, and assume the worst, just like you did. Promise to keep your voice down. I don't think you realize how completely fucked we are because of you. We have no idea what he is capable of doing. He is drunk, he is jealous, and he is awake, wondering where his wife is. Just a matter of time before he comes over here. That's your problem, not mine. He has a gun. He could kill us all. He's completely unhinged. And I'm not? You might be a lot of things, but I know you. You are not capable of doing that. You don't know that. What the fuck is wrong with you? You said so yourself. Who knows what I'm capable of doing under the duress of my husband's infidelity. This isn't a game. There are lives at stake here. Innocent lives. Now, whatever you think might have happened, doesn't... "Might have happened?" There are consequences here. Yeah. Severe fucking consequences. Bingo. Okay. So that's it. You are willing to live with this, - despite what might happen. - No. I'm not willing to live a second longer until you finally come clean about what I know you've been doing. If that was true, then we need physical evidence, don't we? We'd have lots of it, phone records, texts, - emails... - Correct. - Video... - Okay. - Here. Here. - Records. I record him every night. - No, I'm not gonna do that. - Just play it! - Play it. - Your destructive behavior and paranoia has got to stop. I pay you two hundred and fifty dollars an hour, now play the fucking clip! I have heard it. It's white noise. You win. I had an affair. But it wasn't with her. It was with someone else. It was months ago, it didn't mean anything, and I'm really sorry. Who was it? I don't remember her name. It was a one-night thing. It didn't matter. - Where'd you meet? - Online. Online where? Craigslist? Ashley Madison? - It doesn't matter. - Yes, it does. I gave you what you wanted. - Gave me? - Now untie her and let us go before someone really gets hurt. You really are an asshole, you know that? I gave you what you wanted! You expect me to believe that? Oh my God, what is wrong with you people? Get help! Get counseling, get medication, get something, but leave me out of it. I'm sorry that you two have such piss-poor communications, 'cause honestly, I am, but this situation has nothing to do with me. It's true. Shut up and let me finish! You pulled me into this mess. A mess that I had nothing to do with. And now my life and my marriage are at stake because of it. Can't you see what you've done? This can't simply be fixed or forgotten. Look, I am sorry that your husband is such an arsehole. Honestly, I am. But, please, try and put yourself in my shoes. I don't belong here. I didn't do anything. Whatever happens tonight to your marriage, happens, that is for you two to figure out. But just know that my life and my marriage will never be the same again because of you. Even when I press charges and you go to jail, and I sue you for every last dime that you have, it will not erase the fact that you wrongfully put me into your fantasy. You have singlehandedly given me a death sentence. So thank you! Thank you for ruining my life. Okay. You guys, it's not too late. Okay, we can move on from this. We can. We just need to come up with an explanation. Or an alibi to explain what happened, so that way, it's not just Becca's word. Listen to me. We need to agree to never talk about this, ever again. What do you say, Becca? You willing to forget this whole thing ever happened? Well, she'd have to. Because it's the only way she's gonna walk away from this unscathed. Looks like you're in a pickle, my dear. Oh, fuck you. We all are, if we don't solve this. I'm not looking to solve anything. I didn't do anything. I simply want answers. I didn't do anything. I know you have. Have I ever done anything to make you not believe me? You talk in your sleep. Such bullshit. Hang on, wait a second. All of this is because he talks in his sleep? It's what he says in his sleep. Are you fucking serious? My entire life has been turned upside down because you think you heard something? Do you think I wanted this to happen? Do you know how many nights I've laid next to him in bed while he talks about fucking you? Do you know how many times I told myself, "No. It's nothing. It's just a dream. It has nothing to do with you or her... or anyone. It just is." Do you know how many times I've gone into the closet and held the gun to my head, wishing and hoping it would all go away. I've done everything I can to try to make sense of this. I've done more research on sleep talking than I care to admit. And yet, no one believes me. I'm the crazy one. I've checked his phone. His internet history, I even followed him to run errands. And what I've discovered in all of this... For all intents and purposes, he is clean. Then why can't you let this go? Because you won't admit what I know in my heart to be true. Oh my God, fuck your heart! For the last time, I didn't do anything. And if I did, do you really... do you really think it'd be with her? Huh? Really? I'm sorry. You honestly think that I would let this stupid fucker's dick anywhere near me? Okay. So now I'm a stupid fucker. Well, listen, bitch. I'm not the only one with a spouse who has trust issues. Oh, fuck you! Go to hell! Okay. No, do you know what would really be awesome? If Nate came over here and joined in the conversation. I would sure love to hear what he has to say about you. Why did you leave all the lights on? - Ian? - He can't know that I'm here. Ian, it's Nate! It's Nate. Nate... What are you doing here? What time is it? Sorry to wake you. Is Ian home? I just... I need to talk to him. No, he's not here. What do you mean, he's not here? We got into a fight earlier. Then he left. Oh. Where'd he go? I don't know. I'm sorry. I... I took a sleeping pill, I'm a little out of it. So can I come in? Yep. - What's this all about? - Where is he? I told you already, he's not here. His car's here. I don't know. Maybe he went for a walk. At this hour? Yeah. He's done it before. I told you we got into a fight - and he left. - Yeah, I see. I saw him. Earlier, we had a drink together, and then I saw him come home. I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine. Ian! Ian! - Nate. - Ian! Where are you going? You can't just barge in here like this. Nate. What's going on? I heard voices. Voices. One. When I was outside, I heard people talking. I have no idea what you're talking about. I was sleeping when you started banging on the door. It's a miracle I even woke up. What were you guys fighting about? - Same shit, different day. - Just tell me. Married people fight. That's just a fact of life. Thought you guys were happy. What does that even mean? I love him. He loves me. Comfort. Security. History together. All of us have baggage. Marriage is just a matter of figuring out what bags go together, and which bags go where. Have you ever been cheated on? I had a string of asshole boyfriends in high school. As an adult. No. I think Becca is seeing someone. Nate. And I think that person is your husband. Nate. Nate. Nate. What? I'm sorry. Look at you. Just sitting there with nowhere to go. You're mine now, and there's nothing you can do about it. Can you... feel your hands? Did I tie them too tight? Or... That's right. You can't talk, because I gagged you. I can do or say whatever I want, and you just have to sit there and take it. Wow. This is what it must be like to be God. Just to have complete and total control over someone. Kinda like you do to me. Maybe we should put this off. What? Please. Baby. This can't keep going on. This is not gonna end well. That depends. Are you ready to talk? He's gonna come back. He's not gonna give up, and when he does, he's gonna find us. And he's gonna kill us all. Talk. You've never even shot that thing. There is no telling what Nate would do in a drunken rage. You're a good, honest person, who has been pushed to the brink. - Because of you. - Baby. Jesus fucking Christ! Let's get something straight. I may have been pushed to the brink, but don't fool yourself for a second thinking I'm any less of a threat than he is. That's nice, seeing you two together like this. Especially after hearing your exploits for so long. Hm. I wonder what I'd do with you. Or to you. Torture? Nah. Nah. You're too good for that. That's too good for you. Kinda like to see you squirm a little bit. Maybe I could invite... your husband over. I bet he'd like to see this. Yeah. Or what? Oh, you're worried that he would do something when he found out about you and my husband? Wow, he has a crazy temper too. Alex. I might not hurt you. Or maybe... I could blow your fucking head off. Look. Okay. All right. Let's... We're done. I'm gonna go outside. And give you two some privacy. I suggest you use this time to get your stories straight. I expect to hear something more worthwhile when I get back. Alex. I forgive you for doing this. I know what drove you to do this. But I don't blame you. But we're not past the point of no return, okay? We can move on. We can still have a life. Together. I love you. Alex. I always have. I have never once doubted you, or what we have. And I know there have been times when I didn't deserve you. So I understand why you're doing this. I really, honestly do! But do you have any idea how much guilt I've had over the past... I feel guilty every fucking day. And yet I don't even know why. Because I didn't do anything. Do you think I wanna say those things? Do you think I wanna talk in my sleep? I hate myself. I hate myself because I do. And I hate myself because I know! I know how much this hurts you. Funny thing is, you know, I don't even know if I say anything! You know? I mean, you say I do. But there's actually been no concrete proof whatsoever. You realize that, don't you? I'm powerless to do anything, and so are you. I mean, Jesus Christ, this thing is absolutely fucking insane! Alex. Do you know that a few months ago, I actually went out... and I almost did something with someone. Because I actually wanted to have something to confess to. Because I knew how much you needed that. And why didn't you? Because cheatings not in my DNA. It's not who I am! It's not who I am. Have you tried recording it? Yes. And it never sounds the same. Because of that stupid sound machine that you bought me. We got it to help Alex sleep at night. Yeah, some help that was. Sit still, she's going to see you. We have to get out of this, now. - No point, she's got a gun. - So does Nate. Why are you so scared? - Where is your phone? - I don't know. We have to get the phone and call the cops now. - No. - Becca, listen to me. We have to call the cops. It is the only chance we have to get out of this alive. If we call the cops, then Nate will know I was here. He cannot know I was here. One way or another, Becca, our lives are gonna change forever. Either she's gonna kill us, or Nate will. We have to stop that. There is no going back to a normal life after this. Now listen, I am sorry that you got dragged into this. It should never have happened. I am so sorry, but we have to face the inevitable. Either we get to the phone or we're as good as dead. Where is she? Is she home? No. No, come in. What are you doing? Stay. Stay here, she doesn't know. There you are. Oh God, you're so hot. You're so hot. Fuck, yeah. What do you want? Yeah. Fuck, yes. Fuck, yeah. Yeah. Fuck me. Fuck me, yes. Fuck me. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. God, you're so fucking hot. You're so fucking hot. Are you all right? You'll be all right. Trust me. Yes. I'm here. Yes. Breathe. Fuck, yes. Breathe. Breathe. Good. I think my husband is having an affair. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say to that. Is something wrong with me? No. No, there's nothing wrong with you. You just fell in love with the wrong person. That's all. Happens all the time, actually. It happened to me. But you'll be okay. What's your name? Brian. I'm Alex. Becca? Can you reach my hand? Told you. I can barely move my hand. I'm trying. Alex. Baby. Please. I need you to listen to me right now. But that's the thing. I do listen. I do. I listen to you every goddamn night. I listen to you fucking her in your sleep. You are imagining this. For the last time, this is all in your head, Alex. You have trained yourself to hear only what you wanna hear. Fuck you. So I snore. Big fucking deal, buy some ear plugs, okay? Alex! Alex, please. Please put the gun down. This is a roleplay exercise. It's not some warped-out fantasy for you to work your way out of. Sorry. I don't know what came over me. I haven't slept in weeks. What are their names? What? The woman you think is having an affair and her husband. What are their names? Why does it matter? You don't believe me anyway. Oh, it doesn't matter whether I believe you. Anyway, that's not the issue. I'm here to listen to you and to help you work this thing out. You have. Thank you. I appreciate that. I do. That's why I think it's important that you tell me the names. It's for you, so you can meet this problem head-on. That shut you up, didn't it? Think I figured it out. You know what? I think... I think you want this to be true, Alex, because you know what? You wanna be the victim. It's what you've always wanted to be, right? It's good. It's good. Victim? - Like you right now? - Oh, Jesus. Or you every other night? "I lost my job." "It's so hard being unemployed and having my wife support me." "I'm depressed." Boo-hoo. I have you to remind me of that... every day. And you? Always posting selfies on Facebook. Looking for attention, 'cause you probably weren't getting enough at home, were you? Man, it's a wonder Nate took so long to figure you out. Yeah. Yeah, that's right, Alex. This is all one big conspiracy. Me, and... Becca, the neighbor, the entire fucking world, all in cahoots against little old you. - Fuck you. - No. You know what? Fuck you! I trusted you! You did? No, you didn't. You have been looking for a way to leave me without being the bad guy for years. And guess what? Now you have it. - Tell me. - Tell you what? What, that I fucked our neighbor, in our bed, while you were at work? - Is that what you wanna hear? - Keep going. Say it. It just might make me believe you. I'm not gonna give you what you want. Go ahead and kill me, Alex. I don't fucking care. I don't... But I'm not gonna sit here and give you the satisfaction of confessing to something that I didn't do. It's not gonna happen. Not today. You are right about one thing, though. She is. You are more dangerous than Nate. You know, he's just a... lonely, confused, no offense, pathetic drunk who doesn't know what he's doing. But you? Fuck. You know exactly what you're doing. And it scares the shit out of me. I used to think that she needed professional help. You know, with medication, I thought that maybe you had bipolar disorder, or some kind of, like, schizophrenia, but... You're not crazy. I mean, this is who you are, Alex. I'm not about to degrade a mental disorder to justify the fucking monster you've become. What's so funny? I have something I want you to listen to. What is it? Ah, you'll see. I don't wanna spoil the surprise. Oh my God. I just want you to listen to something, okay? - What are you doing? - I just want you to listen. I hear the secrets that you keep when you're talking in your sleep. My God, oh, are you serious? Are you gonna play me one of those recordings again? Alex, we have been over this a thousand times. Just listen. - Do you hear it? - Hear what? - It's just mumbled voices. - Shh. It's the same thing we've heard a thousand times. There's nothing. What is it? Started recording him when he slept, because he didn't believe me. And I never found anything... until now. You recorded him sleep talking. Yeah, it's a conversation. - With who? - With you. Just before you start fucking. And it's the same conversation every night. I don't hear anything. It's just a bunch of mumbles. It's me sleeping. I don't know why this is entertaining to any of you, but there's nothing there. There never has been anything on this, Alex. You realize that, don't you? Play it for me. - Becca, you don't need to con- - No! I want to hear it. - This is insane. - Shut up! Where is she? Is she home? No. No, come in. You hear it, don't you? I... Stay. Stay here. Thank you. Hear what? There's nothing on the recording, Alex! You know it! So do you. Becca, give me your hand! Scoot over, Becca! We need to get out of this fucking now! This is our only fucking chance! Becca, what the fuck is wrong with you? - Who is it? - What? Who is it that you talk about in your sleep every night? - Who is the woman? - What? There is no one. Is it her? Carla? Hailey? Natalie? - It's Natalie, isn't it? - What? So all this time when you've been talking about how much you love me, how much you wanna be with me, you've been shagging someone else. Is that it? - No... - Because that scene that you talk about in your sleep, it has nothing to do with me, - because we've never had sex... - Becca... - ...in your bed! - Sweetie, listen to me, there's no one else... You're such a fucking liar! Alex. Alex. Alex! Fuck. Dammit. Everything okay? Yeah. I made them up. They don't exist. I... created a lie, because I was afraid that Ian was gonna leave me. Oh, wow. And I wanted someone to blame other than myself. That's a breakthrough. I wanna be better. You will. Trust me, you will. Let's go. Shit. She turned the ringer on. She turned the fucking ringer on! Shit! Fuck. Fuck. He's gonna be here any fucking second! No. Almost got it. Got it. Fuck! - Shh! - Fuck. Right. Pull. - Yes. Free your hands. - Yeah, okay. Shit! I need you to pull. I need to pull it free. - Okay. - One, two. Three. Okay. Do it, do it, do it! Ian, shh! - Baby. Baby. - Nate. This is not what it looks like, okay? Look at me. Put the gun down. Put the gun... Shit!
