Come this way. Sae-hee. Sae-hee. What's wrong with my daughter? You can't come in. Daddy. I don't want to be sick anymore. Okay. Daddy will promise to stop the pain. HIS LAST GIFT Take care! Stop it! Are you crazy? Damn it. Hand me the tissue. Get these off of me first. It's bothering me. Is this the treatment I get for helping you? It's not in bad shape. But his liver seems a little fatigued. Instead of taking a risk, Let's do it in a safer way. What do you think? If he rests for couple of days, there won't be any problem. It would be best if he doesn't smoke. And no drinking whatsoever. If I stick this on me, I won't be sick anymore? Yup, all I need to do is cast a spell and it's done. Sim-sim-sala-bin! Heal my Ha-jin's sickness. Let's go. My pretty darling! Oh my goodness. You've gotten so heavy in a day. What'll we do about this? Come on, put me down. How about we do our 'cross'? No. Why not? It's childish. Come on, let's do itjust once. Only once then. Just once. Okay! Father! And daughter! Cross! Cross! Here we go! It's Uncle Dong-hyun! Hi Sae-hee! Is he the guy? What sort of disease? It's called Wilson's disease. She's accumulated copper in her body. Wilson? There's a disease like that? Oh, man. How come it matches mine and none of your relatives? I'm not complaining though. I can get out and take a breath of fresh air. And if I'm lucky, my life sentence can be reduced. I'm fine with that. Miss! Yes, sir? A bottle of Chinese liquor please. Coming right up. Chinese liquor goes great with sweet and sour pork. No alcohol. What? Listen to this bastard. You're not free yet, so don't overdo it. You son of a bitch! Are you treating me like shit because you're a cop now? Watch your mouth! So you think you're something now? If Young-woo hadn't been there, I would've killed you. How dare you throw your chopsticks. You damn pig. I could tell what kind of bastard you are just by the way you eat. What's taking you so long? Hurry and finish up. It stinks. Damn it. What's taking so long? Hey, Kang Tae-ju! Hey! Open the door!

You're still a coward. Chicken. Hey, Yong-tae, it's me. These pants are ridiculous. Feels like I'm going on stage. This sucks. Man, you're amazing. So what are you going to do now? Just tell me wherever you wanna go. I'll send you to North Korea if you want. Are you sure? Just bring me the money I'll ship you off on a boat first thing tomorrow. I just got out, idiot. I see. What's that? This? It's maggot powder. It's really good for the liver. My liver has been in bad shape lately because of alcohol. I survived thanks to this stuff. Wanna try some? So are you still in the business of finding people? I can find a ghost if you pay me enough. Find someone for me. Pay me first. What the hell? I shouldn't have fallen in love I shouldn't have met him So you said you'd give your liver to your high school friend's daughter? If you run away like this, she couldn't have the operation. Who cares if she dies or not. Give me a drink. I'm pretty bad, but he's worse. Well, things never change. By the way, what's the Boss up to lately? The Boss? The Boss is a big man now. He's going crazy to be a congressman. He's such a big shot that he doesn't talk to me anymore. World is screwed up. Let's drink! Look at your damn clothes. You bastard. Where's Kang Tae-ju? I hug you now, I feel your trust in me My feeling now won't... Who are you? When I ask you something, you should answer me. A cop, satisfied? What took you so long? Pigs in Korea are so damn slow. Hey. Think you can catch a petty thief with the way you are? You bastard. Let's go! Let me go! If you run away one more time, I'll kill you. If I die so is your daughter. I have a terrible headache. Drink it. Okay. What the hell is this? Clam extract. It's good for the liver. You drink it. Damn it. I got a headache. Drink it. You've got a lot to do. You stuff yourself with it. Drink it. Get up. You have to go exercise. Hey! Don't you know me? Even if a knife is on my throat, I'll never do what I don't wanna do. Stand up. I can't go any farther. Stand up. We're not on a picnic. I told you to stand up. Shit. What are you doing? We are in public. Sae-hee My baby, Do you call me? Come here, let me hug you. My precious. I want to go home. I hate it here. You'll have your operation soon. Be patient little more. Let's go home and then come back for the operation. Sae-hee. I hate it here. Young-nam died. And so did Ha-jin. Daddy, I really hate it here. Take me home. I'm scared. Dad! Yes? I miss Mom. Okay, Let's go. Oh no, it's too late today. Let's go next time. As the election draws near, competition is heating up between the candidates. During this heated race, candidate Lee Chul-goo visited an old street market with a firm plan to appeal to voters and grab the top spot. Hi Sae-hee! You've come home. The house is brighter than ever with you, princess. Sae-hee, give me a kiss. No! Why not? When I catch you, I'll give you a real kiss. You've gotten faster, Sae-hee. Give him a kiss. Give him a kiss. I'm a monster. Where are you running away to? Let's wash up and eat. Dong-hyun. Yes? Ok I'll help her. Daddy will go in soon, so brush your teeth. Give me your bag, and take off your clothes. Wash up nice and clean. Why'd you set him free? It scares Sae-hee. This bastard will run away again. It looks delicious. You call this food? Sae-hee, eat your carrots. It tastes nasty. Hey. You don't eat carrots, too? Me neither. We got something in common besides our livers. Watch it! Come on, eat. He's not eating them, either. What? You know I never eat carrots Whatever you do. Don't eat them if you don't want to. I grew up just fine without them. You call that 'fine'? Don't put me down in front of the kid. Don't eat it! I'll punish you if you eat it. Kang Tae-ju! What are you laughing at? You have a hole in your sock. Want me to give you one of mine? You have rice on your face. There's nothing there. Go ahead and eat. Don't worry about the boat. Just get the money ready. What? That woman? I'm not playing around. I'm serious You're not playing around? You better not be wrong. Are you sure? Damn it. Anyway, she got hitched and left the town. Why? Want me to look into it more? I don't need it, damn it! Bastard gets all the info he needs, and now he doesn't want to know? How can I help you? I'm from Hanil bank. Did you co-sign for Cho Sung-woo's loan? Come on. Sister. Where's my brother? I heard he's gone bankrupt. What's going on? Get him on the phone. You don't know where he is? Does that make sense? Look for him. How could you not know? Please do something. I'm coming over right now. Listen to me very carefully. Pretend you hadn't seen me. Okay? Just go home after a while, got it? Okay, I see. I'll give you some money to buy some chocolate or hamburger. Go back home after a long while. I can't eat that stuff. What? Stuff like chocolate and hamburgers. I can't eat any cocoa, bananas, tomatoes, or grapes. Nor cola, juice, peanuts, potatoes, and sweet potato. Then don't eat them. Hey. That's why you got so sick, being so picky. I would die. If I eat that kind of food, I will die. I want to eat that kind of food, but I will die. Tae-ju, I got a favor. Come on, please. Stop talking nonsense and go away. I really want to see my Mommy before I have the operation. Daddy promised to take me, but he went out. So take me to her instead of my Dad. Why do I have to take you? You're my Dad's friend. And my Mom would probably want to see a nice man like you. I'm not a nice man, so go. What a pain-in-the-neck. If you take me to her, I'll stick a magic bandage on you. What are you doing? It tickles! I didn't cast the spell yet. - Sim-sim-sala... - What spell, damn it... Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Sim-sim-sala-bim. Heal the legs! Are you done? I'm busy. Go home, okay? Go home late. Driver, step on it. Daddy, don't go! Take me with you! What? No matter how difficult things are, you shouldn't abandon your own child. If you won't take her, get out. Who says I'm abandoning her? And I'm not her father. Can't you see? She's just pretending. Know how much he owes just on interest? You're really unbelievable! Where's your husband? Tell him to bring the money now! Yeah, Dong-hyun. What? What happened? Tea-ju! That's my Mom. She's pretty, isn't she? Yeah, she's pretty, so hurry up and let's go. Mommy, say hello to him. I can have the operation because of him. Mommy, you're also grateful, aren't you? So say thanks to him. Why are you in there? Come out. Something went wrong, right? People have misunderstood, right? Say something! Didn't you know? This is what I am. But you promised our baby. That we'd all live happily together. What baby? How do you know if it's my baby? My life has gotten screwed up after meeting you. Please don't do this. You're making it harder on yourself. Why can't you understand what I'm saying? I don't want to see you, so get lost. You expect me to believe that? I can see it. Shut up and get out of here! You. If you show up in front of my face again, I'll kill you with my bare hands. Kang Tae-ju! Tae-ju, what's the matter? Please, stop. Tae-ju. Tae-ju. I said if you run away again... Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me, damn it? Why? Daddy! Don't hit my Dad! You son of a bitch! Are you crazy? Stand up, asshole. Let go, you bastard! Do you wanna die? Are you all right? Stay still! You bastard! I'll kill you Daddy! Don't move, you bastard! You want to die? Let's talk outside. I'm going to kill you! Okay, but let's talk outside. Talk right here, asshole! I got you, but let's talk outside. You son of a bitch! Let's talk outside! Sae-hee is here! Come outside! Daddy! Don't fight! Sae-hee, it's all right. It's nothing. Asshole! Why didn't you tell me the truth? It's not what you think. Cut it out, asshole! You bastard. What are you going to do for Sae-hee now? What can you do for her? If you say anything to her, I'll kill you. Just give her your liver and go away! Young-Woo! My liver... If I give her my liver... Will she live? How did Sae-hee's mother die? She met a terrible guy, didn't eat well, and then died from a disease. Since when have you liked her? My heart was beating so fast when I first met her on the bus. I had wished that the bus kept on going forever. Why didn't you try to talk to her? I was going to. Get out of the way! But some prick showed up. Cho Young-woo, move away. What do you think? Pretty, huh? Did you get into a fight again? They asked for it. Why didn't you answer the phone yesterday? Because you kept calling me after my bedtime. She must've liked that prick more instead of the loser. Ridiculous. She was probably scared instead. Bastard. Be careful! Hey, Tae-ju! Are you all right? I'm okay. You're not hurt anywhere? It's no big deal. - I told you to be careful. - I was. But I had a sure feeling that she liked me at that time. People who have crushes on others always mistook things that way. Bastard. So when did you meet her again? Ten years have passed, and that beautiful girl, my first love, was withering away. She had a big belly. Got kicked out of her house. And her husband had left her. But strange enough, she looked so pretty to me. Because she was pretty... Because she was so pretty I brought her to my house. She said to me when she was dying... 'I'm sorry I couldn't even cook you a warm meal, and I was so sick all the time. I'm sorry to hurt you. But I was happy thanks to you.' Then she passed away. Bastard, why'd you make me bring that up? Why did you hit my Dad? Who do you think you are? Get out! I don't need you! Get out of our house! Where are you going? To the park. She seems a bit uncomfortable. Sae-hee, I envy you. Eat a lot of delicious food and have fun. Have a good time. Okay, let's go. Bye. See you later. Why? Do you envy them? What did I get myself into? You are so fast. Daddy! I'm here. Yes, sir. Daddy! Okay. I'm sorry. I'm with my child. It would be great if you could give me about a month. At least two weeks. You really upset me. Don't do that. How long will you live like this? So this is the head and the feet. You dummy, can't you see straight? This is the head, these are the feet, and these are the hands. But there aren't any fingers here. Stupid, the baby's making a fist. She took after her father. Can you listen to my voice? It's me, Daddy. My voice sounds cool, doesn't it? Come on, that was childish. An old lady raised me when I was a baby. She once said to me. 'No matter how long we live together we're not a family. There needs to be three people to make a real family. So you and I don't make up a family.' But now, I have a real family. Thank you Hae-young. Thank you so much. My baby, do you hear me? My voice is nice, isn't it? In a few days I hope to see a nice and healthy baby. Sae-hee. Thank you for being born as a healthy baby. Let's live happily together. Sae-hee, are you sleeping? Don't worry about a thing. Daddy will take care of you. You'll get better. Sae-hee, I love you forever. I love you too, Daddy I know. What the hell is wrong with him? What's gotten into him all of a sudden? What's that? Dried maggots. It's good for the liver. So you're going to eat it? It's for the kid. Wait. Hey! Do you think this will change anything? Sae-hee can't eat this. Don't even try it. Get up. We have a lot to do. What the hell did that bastard eat? - Stop and eat. - Come on. Hey, that's a carrot. The amount of fat liver has reduced remarkably. We can have the operation in a few days. Really? What's wrong? The big day is drawing near. That's it. I'm sorry. Hello? I can't get it right. What? What are you talking about? What gives you the right to freeze my bank account? Take my house and whatever I own. But don't touch my bank account. Hello? Hello? Sister! Open the door! Sister! Don't do that! No, that's mine! Don't do that please! Please don't do that! Sae-hee, let's go inside. Don't do that, please! Hey! How do you expect her to ride the bike with that on there? It's stuck on there so that she can't ride it. It's there so that she can't use it. Take it off. I said take it off, you bastard. Does she owe money? I'm asking you if she's the one in debt? If you interfere, you're breaking the law. You bastard! You son of a bitch! What are you doing? Let go of me, you bastards! You know how much trouble I went through to get him out? Don't you? I did it because I felt sorry for you and your kid. Please forgive me. But you can't handle him and cause this mess? Captain, please stop. People are watching. If you make one more mistake, Both you and that bastard will be done for. Let's go, sir. You acted like a big shot, but this is all you can do? What will you do about the money for the operation? I already have enough in my mind, so don't bother me. What will you do about the money? The money, damn it? I'll take care of it. Don't worry. How are you going to take care of it? You can't even manage your own money, so what can you do? Then should I kill someone like you? Hey. Didn't Hae-young leave some money behind? The money that Hae-young had. It should be a lot. You scumbag. Mr. Kim, how are we doing on the poll? Compare to the middle aged, support from young voters is weak. But lately their support has been increasing. You're sure to be elected. Well, don't let your guards down and do your best till the end. Don't worry. We will succeed. Sure. Sir, you have a call. He said his name is Kang Tae-ju. Wh, Who? You don't need to know how I got out. Seems you've forgotten to give the money to Hae-young after what I did for you. I want that money now. Screw your 'misunderstanding'. How dare you kept that money for yourself? I don't care you if you become a congressman or the president. Give me my money now. Get up. You wanna quit? You want to leave this business? You son of a bitch. Shit. Leave here? You bastard. Then go. Go. If you're through with everything, then you better clean up and go. Don't you think? Clean up, okay? Baek In-chul, you asshole. - Is Sae-hee fine? - She's OK I'll handle the money for the surgery. Kang Tae-ju! Don't do anything stupid. Take care of yourself. What's stupid about it? I'm getting money for my daughter's operation. Is that stupid? Do you want to die? You think she's your daughter? Then whose daughter is she? Son of a bitch, do you really want to die? What have you done for Sae-hee? Have you gotten the operation for her? Or did you give her your liver? Also... Just because you've raised her for a few years doesn't make her yours. Get real. You son of a... How dare you steal my daughter? You dirty bastard. You don't know how hard I've raised her, you asshole! Rotten bastard. Mommy. Mommy. Sae-hee. Sae-hee! It's time to take your medicine. Have you seen Sae-hee? Sae-hee just left a while ago. Sae-hee! Sae-hee! Sae-hee! Where on earth did she go? I'm sorry. Sae-hee! Where have you been? Don't leave without telling me. What did you eat? Now I can eat chocolate. And I can eat fruit. Look at me. I'm all right. No problem. So Daddy, don't leave me alone. Of course, I won't. Dong-hyun. Call an ambulance. And handcuff him! Yes, sir! This is Dong-hyun. Send me an ambulance. An ambulance now! Please step aside. Nurse, the monitor please. Thank you. It's a bit difficult to tell you father. Both of them stayed up all night. I wait and wait, but they never come. I wanted to go there, too. If there's a nice place, they don't take me there. And they eat nice meals without me. I waited and waited and waited. But they don't come back. Strange, isn't it? Why won't they ever come back? I miss them so much. Well, I guess so. People can't help missing their children. I keep missing them. My heart hurts so much. This pain is killing me. Ma'am. Her condition is getting worse. She should be operated on as soon as possible. Get the paper work done at the registration office. - Here you go, sir. - Thanks. Do you finish calling? Let's go Dong-hyun. Why? I'm sorry. About what? You bastard! Freeze, you bastard! You son of a bitch! Long time no see, Tae-ju. You look nice. Heard you came out to do a good deed. Why didn't you tell me earlier? - Mr. Kim. - Yes, sir. Here's your money plus interest. But you have to leave here now. Since the election is near, people are digging up my past. Of course, I know you're loyal. But no one can predict the future. I heard you've asked Yong-tae to get you on a boat. I got one ready for you instead. We won't need to see each other again after this. I'm sorry, Hae-young. But don't worry. No matter what I'll get it done. Do you trust me, don't you? Trust me. Don't worry, I can do it. I don't know what Hae-young was to you. But she was the only woman for me. You're very drunk, let's go. Hey, you bastard. How'd you get like this? You were the one that Hae-young loved. You idiot. Then, you should have lived happily with her, you idiot. Cut it out. I'm not done, you dumb bastard! While Hae-young lived with me, she never said that she loved me. Never. Not even once. She always said the same thing. She just said she was sorry. She always said sorry. Tae-ju. Tae-ju. I can't live without Sae-hee. All I have is her. In the beginning, I had no feelings for her. But on the day I buried Hae-young, She held my hand so tightly as if she knew her mother was dead Do You know that feeling? What can I do? What can I do? I can't live without Sae-hee. She is everything to me. Tae-ju. Tae-ju. All I have is Sae-hee. My Sae-hee... Don't ask anything. Let's save Sae-hee for now. I brought your favorite sesame soup. Take your medicine after you eat. You should eat and get vigorous for the operation. I don't want it. Eatjust a little. I said I don't want to eat. If you do not eat, you can't have the operation. You know what will happen if you don't get the operation, right? Probably die. Cho Sae-hee! What did you just say? I said I'll die. Eat. I said eat. Who do you think you are? Doesn't matter, just eat. You're only a kid. Don't talk about dying. It wasn't easy for you to be born. To save you, your father has been going through a lot. Your life doesn't belong to you. It's your father's and your mother's. How dare you talk like that. I hate you! Get out! Mr. Kang Tae-ju? Sae-hee, please eat one spoonful. You are making me sad. When you die, I will die, too. If I die, Daddy will die, too? No need to say. Without you and your mom, how can I live by myself? Daddy, if I'm born again, are you going to be my father? Of course. Come here. I promise. Let me ask you just one favor. Let me be with Sae-hee for a moment. I have to get ready for the operation now. After the operation is done, it's all over. Tonight is the last for me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. In a short while, acacias will come into blossom in our hometown. I remember skipping classes and drinking at the beach. When can I ever go there again? Will it be even possible? I want to go there. Where did all the acacias go? It's really changed a lot, hasn't it? We've changed a lot, too. I don't know how I got like this. But the time I was here with you and Hae-young was the happiest moment for me. Thanks. For saving Sae-hee. I'm the one who's grateful. For you raised her so well. Young-woo, I'm going to be really good when I go back in. Then my sentence will be reduced and I can get out earlier. So that I can watch Sae-hee grow. Watch her get married. And see her baby. Let's take a picture for old time's sake. Wait here. Do you like it? Are you okay? Why? You'll have an operation. Aren't you scared? I'm okay. My Mom will protect me. Right, I'm sure your mom will protect you. Don't you have a family? Yes. I used to have one. I had a pretty wife like your mom. I also had a lovely daughter like you. Now I don't have them. I couldn't take care of them. Do you miss them? Yes, I do. Very much. But I can't see them. I came back too late. It's not too late. But Tae-ju. I'm my Daddy's daughter, Cho Sae-hee. And I'm Kang Tae-ju. That's the first time you've heard my name, right? My name means 'third family member'. I'm sorry, doctor. Yes, we'll leave right away. Don't worry. Yes, sir. Bye. Tae-ju, it's the Boss's present. I can find a ghost if you pay me. I can even kill my friends. Stop. Don't do this! You should've left when you had a chance. Move your hand! - Move your hand! - No What? I'll die for you, Yong-tae. But not here. This belongs to Sae-hee. Please Yong-tae. Please. Let go, asshole. Help! I'm sorry. I knew everything. But I didn't say it. I knew who you were, but I didn't say it. I 'm sorry. I'm sorry. Actually, I really like you. But I'm not supposed to say it. Daddy! He has a stab wound with intensive bleeding. Ma'am. Ma'am, my chest hurts. No matter how many bandages I have it can't stop the pain. My heart hurts so badly. Ma'am. SCP O2 is 85%. Give him an O216 liter. Defibrillator. Charge 200 Charged 200 - 200 ready sir. - Shoot. Charge 300, shoot Don't die! Please don't die, Daddy! Don't die! Don't die! You shouldn't die. Say cheese! Now Mommy won't be lonely any more, right? But don't be too happy together. I'll getjealous. SHIN Hyun-joon HUH Joon-ho CHO Su-min KWON Oh-joong HA Ji-won HIS LASTGIFT
