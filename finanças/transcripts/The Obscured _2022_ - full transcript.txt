Oh, God. We shouldn't be doing this, it's wrong. It's not wrong. They made us this way, Erin. You shouldn't feel guilty. It would destroy your career if people found out. Nobody's found out yet. They will. That's why we need to end this. No! Damn it. It's hurting me, and it's hurting you. We need to stop this, now. Until when? Michael! Until the next time you call me and tell me you love me? Michael, are you gonna get up? Stop it. That hurts. Let me go. Michael, no! No, no, no, Michael. No, no, no. Oh my God! Pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, Billy, it's me. Can you come and get me? What the hell happened? What's going on? I can't talk about it on the phone. Where are you? I'm at Michael's. What happened? I don't remember. What do you mean? I think... I think I blacked out, and Michael was laying there. There's blood all over. I think he's dead. I mean, what did I do? Why don't I remember? What if I did it? What if I killed him? I know you. I know you're innocent. What if I'm not? You said you blacked out. Okay, somebody could have set you up. I don't know anyone who would want Michael dead. You know everything about him? Most everything. Yeah? You know who he runs around with? Who he owes money to? Who his enemies are? No. I am so scared, Billy. I don't know what's happening. I'm gonna help you, okay? What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Shh. It's okay. Okay? I'm here, okay? Shh. I'm here. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. I missed you so much, baby. Love you. I love you too, honey. Do you? Mhm. You know I do. Then why do you always go away from me? You know why. Mm... You know, I'm so much better now. You have no idea. That's great, baby. That's great. No one will ever love you like I do. And I know everything about you, and I still love you. Unconditional love, huh? That's right. Until death do us part. Mm. Mm. You know I'm serious, right? Serious as that face you're making? I am better. I believe you. So you won't go away from me again? You kicked me out last time, remember? I was pissed. You threw a rock at me. If you don't piss me off, then you won't get hurt. Come here. Wait. What? I can't go in there. I'll go. You stay here. Okay? Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! I know I said I wish he was dead, but fuck! Maybe we should call the cops. No! We're not calling the... We're not calling- Why wouldn't we call the cops? We're not calling the cops. We're gonna get him out of here. Okay? Where are we gonna put him? We're gonna get him outta here tonight, and we're gonna put him somewhere close. Just get some blankets, tape, rope, whatever you can find. Okay? Oh, God. Come on. Come on. Anybody know you went to Michael's house? No. We were alone. You told me you weren't seeing each other anymore. I know I did. I think you're gonna need to... Get as far away from here as possible. Please don't leave. Please. Please don't leave me. I'm not gonna leave you. Think you were set up? Set up how? Somebody could've wanted him dead, use you as a fall guy. Hm? I don't know. You sure you don't remember anything? No. I told you, we'd been drinking, and when I woke up, he was dead. I don't remember anything else. You didn't tell me you were drinking. Should you be drinking on your meds? Oh, stop. I just wanna have a little fun. I thought I was fun. You are. But you're more fun with a little alcohol mixed in. All right. That's enough. Stop it! Give that back. Get off. Hey, don't be mad. I won't drink anymore, baby. Okay? I love the car wash. It's so sexy, isn't it? Uh huh. What the fuck? What the fuck did I do? Hey. Hey. So, what do we do now? We lay low. What if somebody finds him? Let's hope they don't. I don't feel so good, Billy. You have to hold it together now, huh? You're in some shit right now. I know. You take your meds? Why not? I left them at the house. Were they in a prescription bottle? With my name on it? Are you fucking stupid? Don't call me stupid, asshole. I was in a panic to get out of the house. The last thing I was thinking about were meds. Fuck you. Okay, okay, okay. We gotta go back there right now, all right? No, I'm not going back there. You left a prescription bottle with my fucking name on it. If you want the cops to come straight to me, that'll do it. Okay? Shit. - Yeah, shit. - Shit. Shit, fuck, God damn it. Go get your shoes. Why? Why? Don't fuckin' argue with me, all right? Just go get your shoes. We gotta go fuckin' right now, all right? Fuck! Fuck! Why are we stopping here? I don't want nobody to see the car. We should walk from here. Okay. The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time. Goodbye. Michael? Baby? Are you home? Billy? Billy! Oh, fuck! What? What? What? Oh, fuck, it's Michael. Fuck! How is this happening? How is this possible? Fuck! Oh my God. How did he get here? Oh my God, Billy. How is he here? Listen. Erin, listen. Listen. Somebody knows he's dead, okay? - No. - Yes. - No. - Somebody saw us here. - No, no. - Yes. Oh, shit. Yes, baby. Come on. - No. - Get up. Get up. No, no, no. Yes. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. So, where'd you go when you went away? New Mexico. What's in New Mexico? Friends. What kind of friends? Tall ones. Short ones. Fat ones, skinny ones. Anyone in particular I should know about? Is there a she? You broke up with me, Erin. It's not that you're Miss Celibate when we're not together. How long you been fucking her? That's none of your business. Yeah, it is. How long? How long? How long you been fucking Billy? You didn't think I knew about him? Every time we break up, you run back to that guy. You love him so much, how come you're not with him right now? I love you. Do you love him too? Do you? Hm? I'm in your brain. In your body, in your blood. And you're in mine. And if you ever leave me again, I'll fucking kill you. I gotta get out of town. I leave tomorrow night. For how long? A while. You know, stop the God damn car. Erin, come- I said stop the car! Where are you going? If you wanna go, then fucking go! Erin, I- Why, Michael? Just fucking go, why wait? I have to go for work, Erin! Work! I'm tired of this shit! You're fucking tired of it? I am tired of it. The secrets, the lying, the half truths. I mean, I never know if I am coming or going with you! One day you're the Michael I'm in love with, and the next you're a total fucking stranger! Do you think it's easy dealing with your mood swings? It's exhausting. I can't keep up. I wish I could be with fucking anyone else. Anywhere else! Really? I can do way better than you. So if that's how you feel, let's just fucking call it. You wanna go to work? Go. Stay as long as you want. 'Cause we're fucking over. Finally. Finally. Ugh! Let's do something fun. Like what? Something to help me forget. Yeah? Yeah. Maybe. - Maybe? - Maybe. Everything's gonna be fine. You know what? I can totally feel it. When all this flows over, we can go some place real nice. We're gonna have a God damn good time. I was thinking the pool. Or maybe the ocean? With cool drinks, and tall glasses, and... A hammock, in the shade. Doesn't that sound nice? Yeah, baby. Yeah? Oh, oh. We can lay out, and we can swim, and we can get jobs, and no one would think to look for us in Hawaii. Right? Nope. So we're gonna do that, right. Of course, baby. I'm so glad you're here. I don't know what I'd do without you. We'll be so happy, baby. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Excuse me. Can I have a light? Sure. Thank you. Do you know what time it is? Oh... Three o'clock. Thanks. - Mhm. - Have a good one. You too. You... You are sneaky. I am sneaky. You have that sneaky phone. You do. What the hell do you think you're doing? Cleaning the room. I specifically put the "Do Not Disturb" sign on for a reason. It looks like it fell off. These are pretty soiled. What happened? - Cut myself shaving. - Oh, it was a bloody nose. It's nothing. Just looks worse than it is. You had a visitor while you were away. What? A woman came looking for you. What did she look like? Dark hair, skinny like you. She say what she wanted? Mm-mm. What was her name? I put fresh towels in. I won't disturb the two of you again. Who the fuck knows I am here? I mean, what did they want? Oh my God, do you think she knows? Do you think she's a cop? No one knows I am fucking here! Yeah, no one knows you're fucking here? Somebody fuckin' knows you're fuckin' here. Okay. Then... What should we do? We should leave, right? We should get our stuff and go before she comes- No, we shouldn't get our stuff and go. No! What do you mean "no"? What do I mean no? What we should do is find out who she is and what she wants. Okay, well, what if she wants to kill me? Why would she wanna kill you? Huh? I don't know. Why the fuck would she wanna kill you? Why would anyone wanna kill Michael? Why would she talk to the hotel manager if she wanted to kill you? I don't know. Maybe it was a trick, you know? Like a bait and switch. Bait and switch. A fucking bait and switch? Stop fucking making fun of me! What we should've fuckin' done is take the fuckin' towels our fuckin' selves. Fuckin' shit! Damn it. Damn it. I'm looking for Erin. Erin, baby. Are you okay? Huh? Erin? I'll handle this, all right? Who are you? What do you want with Erin? I'm looking for her brother, Michael. What about her brother? Look, is Erin here? She's sick. It's all right. Who are you? I'm Audrey. I'm Michael's girlfriend. Why do you think I would know where Michael was? 'Cause I know that he always visits you when he's in town. Mm, funny. He's never mentioned anything about you. Well, we've been dating for over a year now, so... How did you know I was staying at this motel? I saw you at his house, and I followed you here. What? I just had to see you for myself. You know, 'cause he always talks about you, and I think I finally see why. Well, I don't know where he is. Could be working or fooling around. Who knows? Yeah, it's just... It's really not like him to not call or text, and I'm worried. Maybe he's in New Mexico. He likes it there. Yeah. Maybe. Well, I should go. Wait. When did you see me at Michael's? I didn't see you. No. We have to bury the body again. What? That woman saw you with Michael and followed you here. She knows who you're with. And if she calls the cops... Fuck. Fuck. This whole thing feels so surreal. Pull over. I think we should go to the police. No. I mean, they're gonna find us eventually. They will. No, maybe, maybe not. No, that DNA shit. It fucks everyone! Oh my God. They're gonna figure out I was there. They're gonna figure out I was there, and they're gonna put me away. No! Somebody watched us. Somebody watched us bury his fucking body. Who fucking does that? Oh my God. I mean, maybe I'm crazy. I don't know. Maybe this isn't happening. I need to wake up. I need to wake up! I need to wake up! We're gonna go south to Arizona. I'm gonna get some cash from a buddy of mine. We'll figure it from there, okay? We have to go back. What? To Michael. What are you talking about? It's not right, the way we left him. We're gonna get caught. He's gone. Okay? He can't help you, you can't help him. It's done, okay? It's done. No. No, I want to go back. Hey! Fuck! Let's go. What are you doing now? Oh. He liked to drink. It has alcohol in it. What? You say he likes alcohol. Oh, yeah, that's real nice. Well, you could put a big, red flag on it, and then they'll find the body much quicker. That's not what I'm doing. I just want something to memorialize him. Like maybe a big, giant thumbprint right on the dirt? You know what? I'm not leaving until I do something special for him. You're getting pretty good at that. Think so? Mhm. You really like it out here, don't you? It's quiet. There's no one here. No one here to judge me. What's not to like? I don't like to hear my thoughts. They don't always make sense. I know, baby. I know Really? That's the best you could do? Considering we're in the middle of the desert, I'd say you got pretty lucky. I guess you're right. Hey, darling. Are you all right? I don't know what I am. What are these? Remember that time you took me to the lake? Taught me to skip rocks? Yeah. What were you? Seven? Eight? Yeah, but I still kicked your ass. Uh huh. Always the competitor. I'm not doing so good, Michael. I know, baby. I know. I found a lucky penny. Yeah? Yeah. Now what? I'm getting rid of our shoe prints. Don't you ever watch forensic shows? No. Okay, well, one time they caught this guy because of the bugs in the grill of his car. He said he was nowhere near the murder site, but the bugs only live in that area. Oh shit. I'm glad somebody watches those shows. You gonna help me or what? Oh. Uh... Yeah. That's it. Come on. Come on. Hold on. Going in this way. This way. Do you think I'm crazy? No. My mother did. She used to say it to me all the time. Why? Guess she thought I was. Last time I saw her, she tried to pimp me out to her boyfriend. Called me a crazy bitch when I broke a lamp over his head. Michael heard the commotion, came out, kicked the guy out of the house, buck naked. She beat the shit outta both of us, but it was worth it watching him get pulled away with his dick hanging out. And you probably have a hard time understanding my relationship with Michael, huh? I did have a hard time with it, yeah. But then I thought about what you have to deal with me, and I realize, that's a lot. That ain't easy, right? I mean, I can't say that I haven't thought about like, what would it be like if he wasn't here. You'd be free. I mean, you're free right now. For a long time, Michael was all I had. He was my protector, comforted me when things were bad. He was my friend. My father, my brother. I know what he was. I know you hate that I loved him. We can't always choose who we love. I think I'm ready to go now. Where you want to go? Just drive. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Dude, mine is so melted. Whoa. Whoa. I have only the stick. You know, sooner or later that Audrey woman is gonna call the police and tell them about you. So? He was my brother. I mean, it would be totally normal that I was there. Oh, shit. What? My phone. They know exactly where you've been. How? Who? Don't you ever watch any crime shows? No, but apparently you do. Well, the cell phone tower pings when your phone is looking for a signal. Give me your phone. Well, I don't think that's gonna help if it already pinged the tower. Hm? Ah, fuck. You know, that means they can place me right there. I mean, that doesn't prove anything. Right? I mean, he's just missing. Right? Right? Yeah. Right. What do you think if we get married? Married? Yeah. Why would you want to marry me? 'Cause I love you. Okay? Okay. "Okay" what? Okay. I'll marry you. You will? Are you sure though? 'Cause I know you got a lot going on in your mind you're thinking about right now. I don't want you to regret it later. I'm sure! Are you sure? I am sure! Okay. Okay. All right. Let's get married. Let's get married. Ah. Can't believe how long I was holding that. That's cute. Thanks. Too bad we missed the poppies. Yeah. You wanna go check that out? Yeah. I do. It's crazy. You like this log? Sure. You know what's weird? I keep getting these fragments of memories, but none of it makes any sense. It's almost like when you wake up from a dream you want to remember, but then it all disappears in a fog. It's like my brain went offline. When's the last time you blacked out? Like, before Michael? I don't know. A while. It can get a little crazy sometimes. Who doesn't? I found these, in my purse. Forget I had 'em. Want to? Mhm. Yeah. You doin' okay? I don't know what I am. You wanna get married? Like right now? Yeah. Okay. Hold on. I, Billy Murphy, take you, Erin Lane, to be my lawfully wedded wife. In sickness and health, and for richer and for poorer, for as long as we shall live. Hey, baby. I, Erin Lane, take you, Billy Murphy, to be my lawfully wedded husband. Through sickness and in health.

Oh, we're just taking a drive. Right. Erin, you mind stepping out? I'd like to speak to you. What is happening? What the fuck is happening? I mean, Michael is dead. Oh my God. Am I going crazy?
