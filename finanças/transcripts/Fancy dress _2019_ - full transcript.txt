In this garden, children take up the role of Saplings and we teachers are the gardeners If they are watered accurately, you'll get fruits from it Great!

Nandetta, Our sons' Dora doll right, that we gifted BEN He lost it in the swimming pool Shall we buy him one tomorrow itself, please ? Why not? I forgot to take tissues, I'll take it and come Deva, I've sent a few photos in whats app What's the problem? They are new entrants to our Villa Seeing their behavior and mannerisms, I smell a rat May be an issue with my police mentality Still.., better to cross check.

Devaraj, tell me Your intuition is right Both are A Class- Frauds Can't take it light They are persons with solid Goan connection. I've forwarded you some photos in whats app. They've some intention for sure Be careful Okay, thank you. I sent those pics to Goa Seeing those pics, My friend, an S.I. Martin rang me up instantly They identified them on the spot He told that They are thieves based in Goa For sometime, there has been no information about them it seems So, I doubted right They stay at your Kindergarten, Isn't it? Are they planning any Kidnaps? Nothing but, Thinking of their Goan link, We can suspect child trafficking I don't think so Then? Their target is Priya My wife Wearing costumes that my son used to wear, Like my son, Showing craziness towards Dora doll, and.. Using many such tactics, He tried to persuade her To an extend, he has won I don't think there is anything to worry about They are not hard core criminals A little bit of theft, pickpocketing and drugs business, Their profile is not bigger than that You just have to nod I'll put them behind bars - No use of doing it now - Why? The maximum we can charge against them is for Disguise Otherwise, we can pass the buck of some other cases on them That is of no use of it So, are you planning No action against them? It should be there. But not now Why do they target Priya? That should be found out Okay Behind their Fancy Dress, There is some game You do one thing Try to get some more details. That is risky both for Priya and the kids at Kindergarten? Leave that to me All of their moves from today, I'll watch it So, this is what you do here? Without a booze, can't stand with these kids If you mix white booze in this water bottle, It's safe What are you up to? That thing is on the top Wanna knit some idea to bring it down They don't suspect you, right? No, as of now I think, it would be better to stay here itself for sometime with some stratagems Don't even THINK of it I'm tired of this sylvan wig and eerie tooth Do you know something? For sometime, I've been pieing on sponge You are enjoying here, I know Chicks and booze! And what not You didn't add water? Oh! I forgot Piss with this damn biscut I eat it everyday I don't want it.
