(surreal music) - You have chosen the path of courage and sacrifice, Ilias. A journey to the heart of a very dark and evil domain. Many blessings on you, son. You are an example of bravery among men. Come back safely and govern us with the wisdom of your experience. (surreal music) The great Kronos, many and many suns ago, fought with this bow and drove back the terrible creatures that invaded our land. And when he ran out of arrows, the sun suddenly dropped from the sky and entered his bow in a ray of glory, shooting out a deadly hail of flaming arrows at all of his enemies. - It was magic, wasn't it? - No, it was a sign that Cronus had become a man. Sooner or later, each of us must face evil. Some men retreat and take shelter. Others hold their ground and fight back even at the cost of their lives. You have already chosen your path, my son, the path of courage and sacrifice, the path to manhood. Never waver from it. Never turn back. - No matter what happens, I shall not forget these words. - Fare thee well. (surreal music) (exciting music) (surreal music) (wind howls) (man and woman speak foreign language) (woman chants in foreign language) (surreal music) (woman chants in foreign language) (group chants in foreign language) (frightening music) (group speaks foreign language) - We have little for Ocron, only this meat. We give it to you. Take it. (monster growls) - We kill. We kill your people. - Fever and hunger have already taken too many of us. - Ocron take away sun from you, always night. Dark. You all die. - No, take me. I'll go. - Ocron not take old man. Ocron like young flesh. (man whimpers) Doruya. (woman whimpers) (frightening music) (monsters growl) (woman whimpers) (monster murmurs) - Very good. (laughs) Young. Young and fresh. Yes. (growls) Good. (laughs) (surreal music) (woman growls) (monsters grunt) (surreal music) (woman pants) (woman moans) (surreal music) (woman gasps) (woman moans) (surreal music) (arrow zaps) (surreal music) (eerie music) (snake hisses) (arrow thuds) (woman screams) (woman whimpers) - That won't be bothering anybody anymore. (woman laughs nervously) Wait! (woman laughs) Nice way to show your gratitude. (eerie music) (monsters shout in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (monsters groan) (surreal music) (Ilias groans) (surreal music) (men whimper) (monsters growl) (exciting music) (men grunt) (monster growls) (exciting music) (man grunts) (exciting music) (surreal music) - Who are you? - My enemies call me Mace. - And your friends? - I don't have any friends. Do you know what this eye means? It means every man is an enemy. - So why did you save my life? - I didn't save your life. I saved this. (laughs) Where are you from? - From a distant land. My name's Ilias. - If you show me how to use this, I'll take you with me. - Where? - Wherever our feet carry us. (bird whimpers) He's wounded. Here. (bird whimpers) (mystical music) (birds screech) (surreal music) (bird screeches) He'll be all right. - I thought you didn't have friends. - We were talking about men, not about animals. (birds screech) (mystical music) (man groans) - He hold weapon, fly in air and kill from far, far. Weapon fly like wind, fast. - Who is he? Where is he from? - Not from here. Never see before, young, dangerous. He kill many, from far with flying weapon. Kill many, fast like lightning. - Let me see him. Let me see this new weapon. (man groans) (man screams) Silence, you fool. Capture this stranger, Fargo. Get him. I want him and his weapon. Go! (monster grunts) (mystical music) (arrow thuds) (man groans) - I learn fast, don't I? (gentle music) Come. (man whimpers) (mystical music) (man groans) (mystical music) Food. When a man meets a man, you never know which one will die, but when an animal meets a man, it's always the animal that dies. I'm on the animal's side. - Isn't this an animal you're eating? - I didn't kill him. - That's a pretty strange law. - Not when you're hungry. (branch snaps) (eerie music) - What's wrong? - I heard something. (mystical music) - Probably animals prowling for food. - Probably men looking for trouble. (branch snaps) Stay here. (eerie music) (monster growls) - Well? - Nothing. (fire crackles) (monster growls) - Ilias, run, run! (exciting music) (monsters growl) Over there, run! (men groan) (exciting music) - Now where do we go? - Nowhere, we're trapped. (monsters growl) (monster groans) (monsters growl) (monsters speak foreign language) (eerie music) (snake hisses) (eerie music) - (gasps) Snake! Look! (Mace chuckles) - Ah, he's harmless if he doesn't bite you. Out you go, my little friend, out you- Ilias. My friend, we're in luck. He just showed us the way out. (stone rumbles) Let's go. (man speaks foreign language) (man groans) (eerie music) (man grunts in surprise) - Come on, run, run! (shouts) - In my country, they punish you. - They'd have to catch me first. (cheerful music) (Mace speaks foreign language) (women and children exclaim) Aza, food! (cheerful music) (woman speaks foreign language) (romantic music) - Who are these people? - Just people. Aza! - Is she your woman? - She is every time I pass by. You can have her too if you like. - Oh, it's all right. - Take her sister, then. (Mace speaks foreign language) - Mace! Oh, Mace! (speaks foreign language) (cheerful music) - Mm, good. (cheerful music) - Mmm. (cheerful music) (woman grunts) (cheerful music) - Uta. (woman speaks foreign language) (woman giggles) (surreal music) Ilias. (speaks foreign language) (surreal music) (woman giggles) (woman speaks foreign language) (weapon thuds) (woman screams) (woman whimpers) (men scream) (frightening music) - Mace! Mace! (weapon thuds) (Mace groans) (frightening music) (Mace groans) (eerie music) - Ilias. Ilias, where are you? Ilias? (eerie music) Ilias! Answer me! (eerie music) (birds screech) (mystical music) (monster speaks foreign language) (eerie music) (monster speaks foreign language) (eerie music) (bird screeches) (eerie music) (monster speaks foreign language) (Ilias groans) (man speaks foreign language) (man speaks foreign language) - I take you to Ocron alive. Ocron make you die. - Ocron? Who's Ocron? - Ocron rule the sun and make night and day. - That's not true. No one can rule the sun. (monster growls) (mystical music) (monster grunts) (mystical music) - Don't say a word. (monster snores) (monster growls) (punch thuds) (monster groans) Get the bow! (fire explodes) (monsters exclaim) (fire explodes) (men exclaim) (arrow thuds) (man groans) (men mutter in foreign language) (exciting music) (men shout) (monster growls) (punches thud) (exciting music) (monster groans) (monster groans) (Mace groans) (monster roars) (weapon thuds) (exciting music) (monster growls) (Ocron sighs) - Ocron does not forgive those who fail. (monster groans) (eerie music) (Ocron speaks foreign language) (body thuds) (eerie music) Only great Zora can help me stop the wanderer. Only Zora. (Ocron moans) No, no, go away, go away, go back to your land, wanderer! I won't let you find me. Go away! Don't come here. Go away. Go away! No! (whimpers) No, no! (whimpers) No, go away! (arrow zaps) Zora, Zora, Zora, Zora. Great king of darkness, master of treachery, light of all evil, hear me, Great Zora. Rise up from this creature's spirit and take form. Help me, oh great slayer of souls. Foul omens of death torment me. Only you can save me. Rise up, Zora, rise, Zora, Zora, Zora! (dog pants) Zora. (eerie music) - Why have you called me, Ocron? - The darkest and most dreadful creatures of the earth are at your command, Zora. Conjure them up from the valley of evil and order them to stop the wanderer. In return, I offer you my body and my soul. - Forever? - Forever, Zora. Forever. - Do you want him dead or alive? - Kill him. Strike him down. - I shall make him suffer a thousand deaths. - Mace, who were those men? Who's their leader? Answer me. (wind howls) I want to know now. Who is this Ocron, a man, a woman, a creature, what? (Mace grunts) - Listen to me. You just forget about her. - How can I? Innocent men, women and children were slaughtered because of us. - Everybody dies sooner or later. - Don't you want to get revenge? - We already did. - What about Ocron? She's still alive. - What about Ocron? Hmmph, Ocron. (wind howls) I don't bother her. She doesn't bother me. That's why I'm still here, alive. - [Ilias] Where does she live? - Ocron lives far from here. Beyond the great mountains. I'll leave you there with your bow. I've never been beyond that point. After that, you're on your own, all right? (wind howls) I'll get some more wood. (wind howls) - Too many people have suffered. Ocron has to be punished for her crimes. (Mace grunts) - Ilias, give it up. There's still time. Ocron is too strong for you. - No, I can't. I'd be a coward. Let's go hunt for some food. - [Mace] No one here would ever fight Ocron, only a stranger like you. Your land must be a very strange place. - No, not at all. Where I come from, all men can live in peace according to the law set down by our ancestors. You know, I'm sure you'd like it there. You don't always have to search for food. We make it grow close to where we live. - Really? You must be proud of your people. - I am. I can't wait to go back. - You should go back. Ocron is too powerful. (bird screeches) - No, wait. - What's the matter? (birds screech) - Birds are flying towards the water. - What does it mean? - It's not good. (eerie music) (monster chuckles) - Get down. (arrows zap) (monster growls) (arrows zap) Go, go, c'mon, go! (suspenseful music) (arrow thuds) (Ilias whimpers) Ilias! (somber music) (Ilias whimpers) (Ilias whimpers) Easy, easy. - I'm dying. I can feel it. (somber music) - It's a small wound. You'll get better in no time. - Don't lie to me, Mace. I can feel the poison already. - I won't let you die. There's a small valley near here where a magic plant grows, a plant that's more powerful than any poison. - I don't have much time left. Hurry. (somber music) - The water will carry us faster than our feet. We'll get there before the sun sets. (somber music) (Ilias whimpers) - It's too late. Look. (groans) - It's swelling. - Hurry, Mace, it's going through my blood. (screams) - Be strong, Ilias, be strong! (somber music) (bones crack) (Ilias whimpers) (eerie music) I'll leave you here and go to the valley alone. It's faster. (somber music) I'll be back with the magic leaves before the sun rises. (eerie music) (bone cracks) (eerie music) (wolves howl) (bone crackles) (Ilias groans) (eerie music) (water burbles) (eerie music) (blood trickles) (Ilias groans) (foreboding music) (animal screeches) (foreboding music) (Ilias whimpers) (foreboding music) (monster growls) (eerie music) (zombies growl) (frightening music) (Mace groans) (zombies growl) (frightening music) (zombies growl) (wood thuds) (zombie growls) (eerie music) (Mace grunts) (zombies growl) (eerie music) (zombies growl) (weapon thuds) (zombie growls) (eerie music) Ilias. - Mace, Mace, hurry. - As you wish. - Mace. (weapon thuds) (man groans) (men grunt) (weapons thud) (eerie music) (Zora groans) (Mace gasps) (Zora laughs evilly) (eerie music) - If you don't stop the wanderer, Zora, I'm doomed. - He won't go much further. I promise. - Don't fail me like the others. Set loose all the dark and evil creatures at your command. Stop him quickly and strike him dead. Remember, much will be yours. - It will be done, Ocron. (somber music) - Hurry up and leave while you still can, Ilias. - I'm not leaving. I'm running away, let's be honest. - You're a lucky man to be alive. - Come with me. - No, Ilias. - Life is easy. We have long haired beasts that help us work in the fields. You'll like it there, believe me. - I can't leave this part of the world. - Why not? You're alone. You have nobody here waiting for you. - I was born here. Your land may be better than mine, but I would always feel like a stranger. - Here, take it. I won't be needing it where I'm going. - But it belonged to your ancestors. - You saved my life. I want to give you something in return. - No, this weapon is still too dangerous for this land. Go. (somber music) (zombie moans) (zombie moans) (zombie moans) (zombie chirps) (zombie chirps) (eerie music) (monsters scream) (Mace groans) (monsters shout) (Mace groans) (suspenseful music) - Where is your friend? - I have no friends. - You lie. I will make you tell me. (zombie speaks foreign language) - [Father] Sooner or later, each of us must face evil. Some men retreat and take shelter. Others hold their ground and fight back even at the cost of their lives. You have already chosen your path, my son. The path of courage and sacrifice. (somber music) - [Ilias Voiceover] No matter what happens, I shall not forget these words. (somber music) (bird screeches) (somber music) - I ask you one more time. You answer or I make you die in water. You have no choice. You are a fool to give your life. Tell me where your friend is and I'll let you go. Where is he? Answer me. - Mace, I'm here, Mace! (zombies growl) I've come back. I'm not afraid! (surreal music) (bow hums) (arrows zap) (monsters screech) (triumphant music) (arrows zap) (monsters screech) (arrow hums) (monster screeches) (monster grunts) (monster screeches) (Mace screams) (water splashes) (monster screeches) (arrow hums) (monster groans) (eerie music) (water splashes) (Mace groans) (bow hums) (arrow zaps) (monster screeches) (suspenseful music) (Mace whimpers) (water splashes) (dolphin whistles repeatedly) - Mace, Mace! You're alive. (Mace coughs) I never thought I'd see you again, Mace. - Yeah. - Why did you come back? - I owed you a favor and I've got something to settle with Ocron. (Mace groans) Ocron lives beyond those mountains, doesn't she? - [Mace] Yes. - Let's go then. - No. I think it's better if we travel during the night. We still have to cross too much open ground. We'll rest now. (rock crumbles) (Ilias whimpers) (Ilias screams) (eerie music) (monsters growl) (Ilias screams) - Mace, Mace! (screams) Mace, Mace! (eerie music) - Ilias, Ilias, Ilias. (monsters screech) (eerie music) (monsters growl) (monster screeches) (suspenseful music) (Mace grunts) (creature screeches) (Mace grunts repeatedly) (creature screeches) (eerie music) (Mace grunts) (bats screech) (Mace whimpers) (bats screech) (Mace screams rhythmically) (bat screeches) (blood drips) (eerie music) - Ilias. (eerie music) (Zora laughs) - Zora, the great slayer of souls, light of all evil has kept his word, Ocron. The wanderer that once tormented your visions can no longer harm you. I have dispelled the dark omen. - So I see. Good, good. You have worked well, Zora, and soon you shall reap your just reward. But now while his flesh is still warm, I shall open his temple of secrets and devour him. (Ocron speaks foreign language) (monster grunts) He too will not escape his fate. (eerie music) (Ocron gasps) No, no, Zora, you haven't killed him. You have slayed his body but not his soul. His spirit lives on and mock me with eyes that do not see. I am not redeemed yet. The wanderer can still fulfill the omen. (somber music) - [Ilias] Where I come from, all men can live in peace according to the law set down by our ancestors. (somber music) Too many people have suffered. Ocron has to be punished for her crimes. (somber music) - [Mace] Ilias, give it up. Ocron's too strong for you. - [Ilias] No, I can't. I'd be a coward. (somber music) Mace, I dwell in your spirit. Take up my ashes and anoint yourself. The power that Kronos gave to me through his magic bow will now pass on to you. (somber music) - [Mace] Revenge. Revenge. (people weep) (eerie music) (people speak foreign language) (eerie music) (Ocron speaks foreign language) - Ocron, I've come to avenge my friend and to punish you for all the suffering you've caused. Today, the sun will rise without you, Ocron. (eerie music) (people exclaim) - Stop him, Zora. (Zora groans) Get him! (suspenseful music) (monsters growl) Kill him! (suspenseful music) (monsters growl) (bow hums) (arrows zap) (triumphant music) (monsters groan) (bow hums) (arrows zap) (monsters groan) (people exclaim) (body thuds) Fools, you've all betrayed me. A curse on your souls. (dramatic music) Zora, Zora, where are you? Don't abandon me. (triumphant music) (bow hums) (arrow zaps) (Ocron growls) (eerie music) (bow hums) (Ocron screams) (eerie music) (wolf howls) (wolf howls) (eerie music)
