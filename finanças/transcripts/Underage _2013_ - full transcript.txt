Who's the best in the world? - Who's the best in the world? - You. You're the best. - What? - Will you eat it cold? - No, that's alright. Give it to me. - No, I'll heat it up. - It's okay, Caio! - You're lazy. - Are you going out? - No, I'm coming in. Do you have any money? Don't know... Gimme that! Caio! Stay with me. Hey! Hey... Look. Pay attention. Can you see that Asian guy over there? - Yes. - Let's catch him. OK, crush him. Wait. How fast! Go! Gross! Look at this one. Here's the kangaroo. What about that man running over there? See if I can catch him. Wait, wait. Let me see. - Look. - Go, go, go, go. Now! - Did it work? - Yeah. And that ship there, Check it out, tell me, I'm gonna eat it. Go a little bit further... There! There, you ate it! I'm gonna pass you. Go! Go! Ronivon. - Do you also sing Ronivon? - No sir. You know. You're named after a singer do you? Yeah, my grandma has been his fan since she was my age. Your grandma? I see... Do you know Ronnie Von, Counselor? Of course! You're getting old... Did you have some coffee? I had an instant coffee... m bad, right? - The victim is outside. - OK, you may ask her in. - Good afternoon. - You may sit here. - Luara... - Yes. Luara, could you tell us what happened, please? Well, I was sitting in a chair at a kiosk on the beach... Drinking some coconut water, listening to some music, chilling... Then came this brat, took my mp3 player and ran away. And you... were you listening to music when the teenager appeared? No he... He took the mp3 player from the table and run off. So I screamed and run after him. He saw I was catching up, stopped, punched me on the stomach and I fell down to the ground. And do you think it's nice to hit a woman, young man? It hurt so bad I almost puked right there. Then what? Then he escaped and the police officers got him later. - Questions? - No. Suggested measure, councilor? Given that the minor is a recidivist, comma, Left “Fundaçao” demonstrating flaws in his rehabilitation and given the offense is of a serious nature, comma, with violence employed against the victim, comma, I require internment for an indefinite time, period. There is no doubt that this is the most appropriate measure to be taken. The minor is too free. Someone has to impose some limit. Counselor. The action taken by the minor doesn't fit the crime typified as robbery. There are no doubts, after evidence gathered, that the minor committed a simple larceny. There was no serious threat implied by the theft. He simply took the mp3 player and ran away. Thus... there is no possibility of requiring an internment for an indefinite period. A better measure is the probation. On the minor's records... the situation of committing an infraction only two weeks after leaving “Fundaçao Casa”, and on the use of violence against the victim, I hereby decree the internment for an indefinite period of the minor Ronivon... Henrique Soares. You can come in, counselor. Thank you, "Lemme. Don't you like the shelter, Vanessa? But why are you not at the shelter? Look, Your Excellency, Vanessa's situation is very complicated. She is not doing any prenatal tests, She is not doing any prenatal tests, not eating well, has been quite aggressive... The other day she even called me a bitch. She got into a fight with one girl from the shelter, she disappears, stays away for several weeks... I honestly don't know what else to do, I need your help. And why won't you try to go back home? My mother doesn't want to see me. How long since you had prenatal testing? She never had them. Never had them? And this child's father, hasn't shown? Look, Vanessa, it's getting difficult. Everybody's trying to help you, but it seems you don't want help. You have to go back to the shelter. Or to your mother's house. You can't be on the streets. And I'll tell you something... if this child is born on the street - I'll take it away from you. - Counselor, the minor is... in this situation because her mother kicked her out. And you can't take the child from her, as you well know. Vanessa, I need you to go back to the shelter, do your tests... Do you want your baby? Don't you want to take care of it? Would you go back to the shelter? I won't let this child be born on the street. I won't let these two children helpless. Vanessa, I need you to promise me you'll go back to the shelter. Recipes You're leaving me here alone? - Shall we eat? - Be right there. I'm almost done here. Open it. Helena. Can't you advance me some money? - For what? - Why do you need to know? - Won't you tell me? - You think the money's all yours? Helena! Helena! - What's that? - Read it. I'm not going to read anything. On the 10th day of January, 2012, before me... Parties attended in witness... witness hereof, namely, as grantor and reciprocally agents, the heirs children Helena Andrade, born August 18, 1989, Brazilian, single, lawyer, and Caio Galv... ...and Caio Galvéo Andrade, born on June 4, 1996, I was required to do the inventory and partition of property left by the deceased Mauricio Reis Andrade and Carla Gal... ” Man, this sucks, I already know all that! “The real estate. A property consisting of land and a house situated at 7 Castro Alves” OK. What about the picture over there? I've sold it. To fix the leaking in the bathroom, I told you. Is it also in the probate process? The probate process is not meant for this stuff, Caio! “A total area of 700 square meters, 300 square meters of floor area and 400 meters of common area. Said property has been...” ...is it your friend's? And where is your friend? - Deputy. - Hello. Why is he in cuffs? What do you mean why, counselor? You know well you can't handcuff the kids. But he was unsettled at the time of the arrest, and my police officer had to handcuff him to hold the minor. But now he's calm. Please, let him go. - Are you hurt? - No. - Get down from there. - Why? Because that's no place to sit. Get down, Caio. - Paulo! - Helena. I would like to speak to you for a minute. Of course. - You heard about Caio. - Yeah. How did that happen? Kid's business. You are not going through with it, are you? - What's up, Caio? - Hey. - What happened? - What do you mean? What do I mean what, why are you here? Oh, I'm here because... a friend of mine had that piece, didn't have anywhere to keep it because his mom would... she would go through his things. Then I said, OK, I'll keep it for a while, no problem. - A friend? - Yes. What about that story of disrespecting an officer? That's a lie, I didn't disrespect no one. - Lie? - Yeah. Look, Caio, I'm gonna let you go this time... But there's not going to be a second chance. What a slip, huh? I told you already. It was my friend's. Can I see this tattoo? Thanks. - Matheus, right? - Yes, sir. Tattooed Matheus... - What about that hair, Matheus? - It's highlights. - What? - Highlights. Did you do it yourself or at the hairdresser's? I did it at a friends' house. - You gotta put a... - Bleacher. Bleacher. Do you do it... on the shower? No, you do some mixing, put it in the bowl, put it on your hair and after 20 minutes it's like this. You stole a bike then, Matheus? - Was it the first time? - Yes sir. What happened? I was with a friend, I saw the bike parked in front of the store, no one was around... I got it to ride it, me and my friend. Me and my friends is going, people began screaming thief! Thief! My friend got scared and jumped out of the bike and ran away, when I was going to jump, I tripped and fell. People came and hit me, punched me and all, kicked me. Thief, he has a gun, catch him! And then I stayed on the ground. - Do you go to school, Matheus? - No sir. Sir, he was living at a friend's, that's why he is not enrolled. Living at a friend's house? Where is your mother, Matheus? I haven't seen her for about a year. She lives in Sao Paulo. And your father? There's a step father there. A drunkard. - And they let you leave home? - I just left. - Do you work? - No sir, I'm still very young. Yeah, but to steal bikes you're not that young, right? Matheus, without a legal guardian it's difficult to let you go, see? Your Excellency, I have a petition. The minor's a first offender, the victim obtained the stolen object back, there was no violence. It's the case of revoking the provisional internment. Yeah, but he fled from home. Where is he going back to? The streets? He can go back to his friend's house. But his mother don't want me there no longer If I find your mother, would you talk to her? You have a mom, Matheus. You have no idea how important that is. Please... I'm looking for Ms. Alzira, do you know her? Oh, yes. Turn left here, the grey house. - Thanks. - Thank you. How is he? He was caught robbing a bike, but it seems he's a good boy. Oh my God, I knew it. He began screwing up. Left home... I want to go to this hearing, but it's in Santos. I can't make it. I can't even feed those boys there. Their dad left me. Taking what belongs to somebody else. That's not what I taught him. I am counting on you on that hearing. Where have you been? Caio. Caio! Open it, Caio. - I was worried sick! - Leave me alone! Matheus! Caio? - Are you crazy? - Calm down, Caio! Where's my money? Where is my phone? Where is my stuff? - Mind your words! - I say what I want. - You're not my mother! - Give me my purse! Give me that! What's this money? Where did you get it? I'm working my ass off and you're full of cash, is that it? Give me this shit! Give me that. Caio! Fuck you, Helena! Hello? Sit up straight. “On the 9th day of September, 2012, Caio Galvéo Andrade was caught in action while trying to rob a house at Bolivar Street, leaving one hospitalized victim. José Gongalves Freire, due to the firing of one shot with a 38 caliber gun, attempting to evade the site upon police arrival. The minor was accompanied by two people, possibly minors, who managed to escape.” Is that true, Caio? No, that is not true. What happened was that I was going down the street when I saw this kids robbing the guy, then I got scared. Then I crossed over the street, went to the other side. Then, the police, like... I was running from hem when the police arrived. And the police thought I was... and caught me. And what were you doing on that street? Well, I was just... Your Excellency, we have had an argument, he was outside to clear his mind. Do you have anyone who can support your deposition? No. But I am innocent. This police are corrupt that have nobody to accuse and are using me. They even beat me at the police station. Counselor... you'll have to prove that. Your Excellency, I have a petition. Considering it's the miner's first of fence, good student and has the support of his family, I request revoking the provisional internment. Your Excellency... Taking into account the defense's duly testified arguments... I agree that he can wait in freedom for his judgment hearing. Counselor, if this was another minor, would you agree on that? Is there any kind of restriction to your performance in this case due to your friendship with the defense? - Of course not, Excellency. - Of course not? Counselor, if you keep on insisting on this behavior I'll have to inform the general justice prosecutor, who can remove you from this case. Face the facts presented so far... it's about an offense with severe violence to the person. The adolescent, although 1st offender, have been arrested before receiving forgiveness from this judgment. Thereby, I maintain the provisional internment of the adolescent until the hearing of instruction. Your Excellency, the adolescent, for his physicals attributes, may be crushed inside the Fundagéo. Physical attributes? Because he is blonde haired? Because he is white? Counselor, first prove the innocence of the adolescent, then we'll see if he's different from anybody else. Take your clothes off. Take your clothes off. You may put it there. Your socks too. Spread your arms and legs. Yeah, palm open, left hand palm. Right hand palm. Left foot. The other one. Raise your arms. Raise your arms! Higher! Open your mouth. Shake your hair. You may remove the skivvies. - Skivvies? - Your underwear, kid. Up and down three times. You may get dressed. Look. Don't you want some? Are you eating well? Oh... I can eat. Better than your food. Caio. Get me out of here. Yo, yo, yo! Be cool there, girl, we just came for what is ours and we're taking off, ok? Go man, take the stuff already, bro! - Should I take the mp4? - Yes. - Let's go then. - Let's go, did you get it? Here. Wait! - Hi. -Hi. - How are you? - Fine. Can you help me, have you seen this kid around here? - No. - No? - OK, thanks. - It's nothing. Hi, excuse me... Have you by any chance seen this kid around? - No? - No. What about a kid, a bit taller than me, short black hair with stripes... drawings on the side... Dark eyes, white skin... Oh yes, I know him, he lives on the street, on the turn. - Here? - Yeah at... number 398. - He's Ms. Silvia's son. - That's right. - Ms. Silvia? - Yes. - OK, thanks. - You're welcome. - Hi. - Hey. - Are you Ms. Silvia? - No ma'am. - No? - No. Do you know a Ms. Silvia around here? - Who are you, a social worker? - No, I'm an attorney. - She lives here. Just go... - Is she in there? - Oh, you must check inside. - Can I come in? - Yes, yes. - Thanks. And what was he supposedly doing there? Oh, there's a group there. Loitering, dealing, stealing. You know what. And we are keeping an eye on this area for some time, doing daily rounds to catch the rest of the gang. What gang? Caio is not part of any gang. You are completely mistaken. Do you and your brother live in the same house? Didn't you ever notice anything different in this kid? Caio, for God's sake, tell me the truth. There were some kids back at the house. - Kids? - Your friends. Helena. Ready? You may call the witness, please. Counselor. She said she won't testify on the presence of the minor. Stand up, please. I want you to go to that white wall. Stare at the wall, don't want you looking here, just at the wall. Good afternoon. Please, come closer to him, he's not going to look at you, only at the wall, so you can recognize him. - Clarice Rocha. - Yes. - Good afternoon, Clarice. - Good afternoon. - Did you recognize the adolescent? - Yes, It was him. - Him what? - That shot. - Are you sure? - Positive. I was looking out my window, saw 3 kids. And he is the one that fired. I was looking out the window, only to pass the time, and three boys were hanging around my street for some time. I thought it was better to call the police because there's been a lot of robbery to the houses there. Then, when Mr. Jose arrived they came closer and when he left the car to open the gate they approached him. And they are only kids. Yes, then what? Then they took his wallet, his keys, there was a mess there and Mr. José tried to get these things back, and that blonde one... he fired. Questions, Counselor? No. Counselor? Do you wear glasses? Yes ma'am. Were you wearing glasses at the moment of the robbery? No, I wasn't. I only wear glasses up close, you can check my prescription because I see far very well. But according to the report, the kids were wearing caps. By the time the police arrived, there was an uproar and this kid's hat fell off, I could see his face well. And the hair is different, right? It stays in your mind. - Very well, thank you. - I hope I was of any help. Excuse me. Can I... can I go? Did you hear what the witness said, Caio? Yes. So it means you were going down the street, by accident, passed, by accident, a house being robbed, and then a gun appeared like magic in your hand? But what about my word? Yes, it's your word against a witness's word, against the word of two officers. There was a victim Caio! He's hospitalized! You think you're so different from the kids that come here. Don't you? Do you have any idea of the shame you're causing your sister? Who's the only person you have in your life, who you can count on? Do you know your sister can lose your custody, Caio? Helena... Suggested measure, Counselor? İnternment for an indefinite period. Counselor? I plead supervised freedom. Faced with the evidence gathered in the records, the testimony of the minor was left isolated, reason why it does not deserve to be upheld. Also because the testimony brought before the Court today brings detailed information... of the disturbing behavior of the young man, who deserves to be closely monitored with proper care and detention. So I understand that the most appropriate measure is an indefinite period of internment. That will bring fruitful resocialization and especially awareness of the seriousness of the act performed.
