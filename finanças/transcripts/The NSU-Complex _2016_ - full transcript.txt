Germany for Germans, foreigners out! Now, we'll show you how we storm the buildings of the asylum seekers and their left-wing friends. Paramilitary training, class struggle etc., raised fists... We grew up with that here. It was totally out of control. He didn't seem mature enough in that respect. But otherwise, as a person, he was fine. This was when I first became aware of the right-wing scene in Jena. I was beaten up properly for the first time in '93, on my way home from a football match, by three Nazis, a woman, who was Beate Zschäpe's best friend, and two men. They weren't playing around. Every week, we heard reports about people getting beaten, hospitalized. Every week! Downtown, where we were still able to move around quite safely, got dangerous on Tuesdays at around 10:00, 10:30 at night. The Nazis would wait for us with baseball bats in cars. Anyone coming out of the youth club was a target. They would follow them slowly to a darker road, and then grab them. "Did you hear Wohlleben has a new car? And that he recently drove Mundlos' car? Any idea what he's driving?" We wanted to completely incapacitate the left, push them out of here, shatter them. The full package to the limit. The fact that no one was killed here surprises me more than anything. But people did die. People were murdered by Nazis in Magdeburg, in Zerbst. During the attacks on the refugee camps. It did happen. the refugees, the foreigners, the immigrants. There was no need to go to the refugee camps. To get this information, we needed people on the inside. You need to have people nearby who can supply intelligence about criminal plans and about the key players. But we want to know more about terrorist structures, and in order to acquire this information, it's sometimes unavoidable They are not just sources, but they are human beings that we lead. We assign them to a certain mission, to inquire whether particular people have seen or heard anything important. a few years later, as of 1995, demonstrations, leaflets, and political campaigns became more important. The attacks didn't decrease, but political marches were more visible. RUDOLF HESS DIED 9 YEARS AGO YOU'RE IN OUR THOUGHTS by the political work anymore. So they passed it on to Herr Brandt. All phone numbers, addresses, everything. And he took control. Right after the German reunification, I moved to the West, to Regensburg, for an internship. But when I saw the drugs, this vermin, this mob of scruffy leftists, I knew it was not what I was looking for. It was the first time that the public focused on Peace Ambassador Rudolf Hess. No one was killed in Auschwitz. And let me be clear. Unfortunately, no one was killed. And we, as a generation of young Germans, unfortunately, have not killed anyone! When the first house searches began, it became obvious that the government persecution from the West was just a bad as the old persecution from the Eastern secret police. For us, the socialist East wasn't perfect, but West Germany was not what we wanted either. So, as German socialists, we took a third path, the path of National Socialism. It was during the Rudolf Hess march. We had a poster: "Revenge for Hess." Below it, there was a swastika, and the poster was connected to the dummy bomb. Then, there was another dummy bomb on a stone memorial for the victims of fascism. Well-known figures like the comrades from Jena, myself, and the three-- Uwe Mundlos, Uwe Böhnhardt, and Beate Zschäpe-- all participated. Later, there were police investigations, wire-taps, house searches. They produced a lot of paper. He was well-trained, well-schooled, immune to their tricks. He was a fanatic. especially for our more violent conflicts. We can safely assume that it is a terrorist threat when people start hanging straw effigies of Mr. Bubis from a bridge. BOMB TO EACH HIS OWN We campaigned actively against historical lies. We protested the defamation of German soldiers as war criminals, a generalization we never accepted. OUR GRANDFATHERS WERE NOT CRIMINALS with access to information about all unmarked police cars in Thuringia. We pretty much knew who was following us. Sometimes, we even went over and brought them coffee and stuff. We listened in on police frequencies, so we pretty much knew what was going on. We had a comprehensive overview of right-wing activities in Thuringia, COMPOSITION OF ALL RIGHT-WING GROUPS IN THURINGIA ABSOLUTE POWER! and that's what happened every Friday-- it was clear they planned to strike big someday. WE'RE FED UP WITH ALL THE LIES AND DECEIT THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING "Best wishes for an explosive new year." And surprisingly, we heard nothing of significance. They were aware that Tino Brandt worked for Domestic Intelligence. That was the reason why some neo-Nazis cooperated with him. It minimized the risk that they would be prosecuted when they were accused of a crime. I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE Award Adolf Hitler! Award Adolf Hitler with the Nobel Prize! Raise the red flag! Raise the red flag with the swastika! The concerts were followed by interviews with local media outlets. Domestic Intelligence chose this as an opportunity to contact us. First, they asked questions during the interview. Then, they sought my cooperation. Political work is expensive. Weekend demonstrations and large events... You can't afford these expenses on a regular salary. And I never could have covered the legal costs if the Intelligence Service hadn't reimbursed me. We were receiving warnings from my partners at Domestic Intelligence that various police investigations were now being carried out against us. Police officers often came to me with complaints that their searches never turned up anything. They were frustrated, and they often felt the neo-Nazis were even making fun of them. "So, you're finally showing up?" They felt ridiculed. The deeper I got with my investigation, the more appalled I was. I could see what had happened. It was obvious how important it had become to protect the source. It was self-defense. If he hadn't shot at them, they would have shot him. Big deal. That's what it was like back then. VISUAL CONTACT GROUP LEADER HOW TO SABOTAGE TELEPHONE LINES We told each other what we'd bought. One had bought a rifle. The other one, a pistol. We shared ideas on how to turn mock-up weapons into real ones. Someone copied me, I copied someone else. There was a witness who claimed a bazooka had been fired. about contacts between a local, Karl-Heinz Hoffmann, the fanatic former leader of Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann, It was all here in my jurisdiction, here in Thuringia. I then received clear instructions from the State Security Office to drop my investigations into Karl-Heinz Hoffmann. Hoffmann, I was told, was a political pensioner and of no interest to me. He did not fall under the scope of my investigation. I know of no comparable operations of this scale that we've supported when recruiting sources. POLICE UKW RADIO MANUAL We started discussing whether it was time to form a military army, similar to the Red Army Faction (RAF). At least, to blow up something, a memorial stone or something. In the beginning, we didn't actually want to hurt people. My criminal expertise grew out of the development of the RAF. And we now recognized identical processes in the right-wing scene. I could not use the term "Brown Army Faction." A state secretary expressly forbade that. was fully functional. Only the power source for the detonator was missing. PUBLIC COURT SESSION was commissioned to observe the Jena Fellowship. But we had to withdraw them. The official version is that an agent from Domestic Intelligence had been observing them. and had seen them enter the garage and close the door. End of story. TARGET because, at the turn of the year '97/'98, the public prosecutor wanted to grant Böhnhardt a holiday amnesty for Christmas. so they spared him. NATIONALISM - AN IDEA SEEKS ACTIVISTS! called in sick. The key detective on the case was away on training. Böhnhardt was able to take one of the cars and simply drive away. the three were able to flee. An arrest warrant was expected since the police found more than just propaganda materials. The police also found explosives, so they were going underground. To us, they were comrades. So, of course, we helped out when they were in trouble. They were staying with their Nazi friends, with the support of the Nazis. RE: "USBV IN JENA" IN PARTICULAR: "TRIPLET" CASE It was kind of a cult. A parallel society, really. There are foreigners everywhere. They want to take everything away. All politicians are controlled by Jews. It's horrible. This made people aware of the White Aryan Resistance. People said, "There are only a few of us, and we have to cooperate internationally in order to achieve our objectives." People were sure it was coming soon. We just didn't know when. They organized lots of concerts. There were record companies. It was a license to print money, almost like the mob. CONFIDENTIAL They had an issue because they needed new passports, which, of course, costs money. Donations were trickling off, so Domestic Intelligence decided to help. They gave me money, which I forwarded to the trio. ROBBERS WANTED REWARD - 2,000 DM The gun was fired at head or chest height. You can still see the bullet holes, here and over there. If you think the time is ripe and you are ready, do it. But don't tell anyone. Violence was definitely an issue. I never witnessed any concrete planning, but the propaganda machine was pumping up the pressure Among other things, I was asked to translate a brochure. There's a big difference between reading a text and translating it. To translate, you cannot just skim through it. I think a lot of young people had no idea what or whom they were following. Some don't realize it until they are right on the brink and have to look terror-- there's no other name for it-- directly in the eye. I believe our analysis was indeed correct. We saw that it was possible. What we were missing was concrete information and sources of information on the fugitive trio and their fanatical supporters. "LEADER OF THE PACK" POLICE NATIONAL SOCIALIST UNDERGROUND E. SIMSEK WILL REALIZE NOW HOW SERIOUSLY WE TAKE THE PRESERVATION OF THE GERMAN NATION I employed Mr. Marschner from 2000 to 2001 and clearing sites for subsequent work. He kept these people out of trouble. They were busy on the building site. My impression was that they could get rid of their aggression there. The man in this picture was Mr. Marschner's foreman. He had a striking moustache... and always dressed in black. His eyebrows are also very striking. If I noticed things during site visits, I could discuss them with this man. -Good morning, Mr. Marschner. -Get off the property immediately. -Did you--? -Get off the property immediately! Yes, we're leaving the property. Could you tell us whether you employed Mr. Mundlos? No, I didn't. Immediately! There'll be trouble, real trouble! And clear off with your camera! Others had difficult personalities and were extremely difficult to handle. But, at the time, the decision was made, rather than deactivating them as sources, to continue to handle them because they were seen to be providing valuable information at the time. MONTHLY STATEMENT CAR RENTALS ZWICKAU NEWSLETTER FOR COMRADES THANK YOU, NSU. WE WERE SUCCESSFUL. THE FIGHT GOES ON... DONER MURDER WHO KNOWS THE VICTIM? which states that victims were either members of a criminal organization or had been threatened by a criminal organization. At this time, no one was claiming responsibility. The only link was the weapon, the Ceská 83. The Domestic Intelligence Agency was still dedicated to clarification. "Where are these three people and what are they doing?" The front was pointing towards the doorway. Then I carried on, went into the kitchen to get some hot water. At that moment, there was a big explosion. I thought the guy was blonde, but the police asked me if he might not have had dark hair. At that moment, I lost all confidence in the police. They were trying to push me in the wrong direction. Actually, several months after the BAO Bosporus started its work in autumn 2005, we began to have initial doubts about the so-called "Organization Theory," that the perpetrators came from organized crime, MURDER 30,000 EURO REWARD HAVE YOU SEEN CYCLISTS WHO FIT THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION? What disturbed us most was that the killers kept the weapon. Using the same weapon again and again establishes associations for us... connecting the individual crimes. This is a difficult behavioral pattern to explain, particularly in the context of organized crime, whose ultimate interest is to work covertly and avoid attention. He was not at all interesting ideologically because he was totally focused on all Nordic gods. I wouldn't describe him as particularly intelligent, but he was very active. Somebody invited him over so we could get to know him. He was there from its founding. We were convinced we were the good guys. It comes down to the love for your own race. It wasn't about hating others. We simply wanted racial segregation. this source was supplying was so valuable that we would continue to use it despite the risks. was used as a file name. It certainly doesn't prove that Corelli knew the NSU under that name The forensic investigations were still active, so I had to wear protective clothes. Also, I experienced the scene myself. It was, of course, very unusual to us that the one person who was present and was neither identified nor made themselves available as a witness, was employed by Domestic Intelligence. he apparently didn't see the man who had been shot lying on the floor. People perceive things differently. I think I would have noticed this person from where I was standing. I have had to take statements I did not believe. Temme's is one of them. I found it hard to believe. "Would an arrest warrant have been appropriate?" But we unfortunately noted that Domestic Intelligence in Hesse and the Ministry of the Interior blocked all access to further inquiries. We couldn't get to the bottom of the truth in Kassel. That bothered us the whole time. We discussed it time and time again in every major meeting. But our hands were effectively tied by the decision from the Hesse Ministry of the Interior. like the kind you would expect from public authorities who are responsible for security in our country. Of course, we continued our investigations concerning the entire murder series. We were able to confirm that, on two occasions at least, intelligence agent Temme had a clear and verifiable alibi. If you think it has something to do with organized crime, then victims are not randomly or situationally selected, but targeted specifically as persons who have to be removed. -There's the doctor. -What's going on here? Then keeping the weapon makes sense because the weapon is the message. INVESTIGATION TEAM "BOSPORUS" CRIMINAL PROCEDURE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS We already knew one thing from the first murder. It was possible that two killers were involved because two weapons were used. or, as we phrased during the presentation of our theory, "They are brothers in spirit." "What other kind of offense could someone like this commit?" We saw similarities in this destructive rage. PROFILE OF THE PERPETRATOR RIGHT-WING SCENE ATTRACTION TO WEAPONS SEX, AGE, GEOGRAPHY, NATIONALITY CRIMES CAUSED BY WEAPONS / EXPLOSIVES KNOWN / UNKNOWN PERPETRATOR FAR-RIGHT CRIMES Now, we had developed a new hypothesis internally, and somewhat distracted, implying some sort of psychological influence. "What could happen in the worst case?" In the worst case, there are new cases. The weapon is changed. The victims change. 20-30 years old, 175-185 cm tall, dark blond hair, Saxon dialect FEAR OF THE SERIAL KILLER 9. TURK KILLED OPERATION STARS FOR THE NSU NO 10th VICTIM POLICE But he definitely knew what was going on and what he was getting into. If I join a club where I have to submit an essay on the topic of race... and then say that I didn't know what it was all about... I mean, really. To infiltrate society, to enforce racial segregation. NATIONAL SOCIALIST UNDERGROUND PAUL'S NEW TRICKS MITTELFRANKEN POLICE HEADQUARTERS INVESTIGATION TEAM "BOSPORUS" We even contacted the task force in Heilbronn, which was dealing with the Kiesewetter murder case, and ended up comparing all our information and our data. the leads that we had developed were insufficient. We had nowhere to go. However, as a police officer, you are often confronted with these feelings because it is a fact that not all crimes committed can be solved. Here is where the weapons and the method of flight, escaping with bicycles, of course, caught their eye. carry out such attacks in the twilight hours and also very often in the second half of the week. between the response vehicles and the control center, you could assume that the two suspects knew that the roads out of Eisenach were being watched. I also think they knew that we were looking for a mobile home. I was confronted with a very complex situation. they didn't necessarily have to shoot themselves. Perhaps there's a story that we don't know about yet. That was the starting point for further investigations. I was informed that one of the bodies had been identified. It was Uwe Mundlos. "If there is any information about these three, He replied that he had no knowledge, that he didn't know where they'd lived or where their hideout had been. Well, I know a few people that I would also suspect of something like this, but no one would ever think that of them or suspect them. I think that when the time is right, there'll be enough. -That would do something like the NSU? -Yes. No matter what happened, it doesn't change anything about the fact that we think of the time back then positively, that we are not ashamed of the things we have done politically. And, of course, that binds us together, and I don't think there are any backstabbers. Why were these nine immigrants killed? Why was Ms. Kiesewetter killed? Why this place and not another? Why did they stop killing immigrants after the ninth murder? Was it really only these three, or were there others that supported them? is the only explanation. There may be others behind it, or totally different contexts. Due to the specific nature of the right-wing scene and its infiltration by intelligence informers, Either there were really only two or three people around them who knew, or the information was there, but it wasn't passed on. At least, not to the BAO Bosporus Task Force. -Do you think that's possible? -I don't rule out anything.
