I look like an ordinary boy, but I'm not. If I were an ordinary boy, I would be bothered that Mom and Dad keep forgetting me. Or that they don't have any time for me. I would be bothered that no one asked me if I wanted to move to great aunt Brunhilda's creepy house. But I'm not an ordinary boy. I have a heart of stone. ERIK STONEHEART Here it is! We're home. Erik, let's go inside! It's awesome. So, this is gong to be the living room. Where? - Down here. Here? - Yes! ...what people? When friends come over. Home cinema was supposed to be upstairs. Erik, where are you? Oh, you're in the kitchen. So, we'll have all new equipment here. I already ordered everything. What equipment? What did you order? All the stuff. Furniture as well. What did you order? I ordered the home appliances... Have you any idea how long the wait list is? Erik! Erik, don't go there! Why? Bad people live there. Come! Let's go see your room. Who are those bad people? Don't you worry about it. Soon they will be gone and we can start renovating. Sweetie pie, I promise you ― this will be the most beautiful home in the world. Are you ready? And this is the most beautiful room in this house. And this is ― well, yeah... Your new bed hasn't arrived yet. Raul, you were supposed to take aunt Brunhilda's picture down! Why did she leave her house to us? She had no one else. Why? Well, she was... Strange. - Yes. What do you mean? Well, she liked... to hold séances and things like that. What are séances? Summoning spirits. Like... dead people's spirits? Yes. Raul... Oh, right... Honeybun, did I scare you? No. What's scary about that? Erik! Enough already. It's late. First night in our new home. Good night, pumpkin. - Good night! Erik! Wake up! Erik! Look at me! Erik! Erik! Erik, look at me! Mom! Mom! - Down here, Erik! Look at me, Erik! I have to warn you! Look. There is a girl in this house, who cries every night! Erik! Erik! What happened? Why aren't you in bed? Mom, I don't like it here. Let's move back to our old home. My little muffin, what's wrong now? Did you get scared? Ye... No. Nothing scares me. It's just an old person's room. Honey, the renovation will start soon. You'll get your own room. Get dressed. Dad and I will be a little late tonight. But you're a big boy, you'll manage, right? Oh, god. Bye! Careful! Look where you're going. What are you staring at? What are you, in love? Hey, pretty good cookies. Those are my cookies. Did you say something? These cookies crackle so loudly, I couldn't hear you. I said, those are mine. Come and take them then. Isn't that what you do? You and your parents. What? - Take other people's things. What things? Like me and my Pop's home. This is our house. Yeah right. You are nothing but bourgeois intruders. You will regret moving here. I promise it, honey bunny. You can't do anything to me ― my heart is made of stone. What? My heart is made of stone. I don't care what you do or say. Right, like I believe that. You can try, but I don't let feelings get to me. Not even pain? Try me. You just have fatty arms. Yes? Sorry, I didn't introduce myself before. My name is Maria. Erik. Very... unpleasant! You missed! Look behind you. Didn't I tell you these were bad people? Why did you play with her? I didn't play with her. I don't even like her. Where do you go with the pillow case? Outside. It stinks. This is insane! What kind of girl acts that way? Don't touch it! The whole house stinks of rotten eggs. It's hydrogen sulphide. Whatever. Raul! We can't live here like this. No, we can't. I have had enough. I'm going to go upstairs and tell them... Answer the phone. Yes, hello! Yes? I'll tell them later... Exactly! But, let's move back then. We'll see. Your daughter's behaviour shows that we can't live here together. So you are throwing us out? People move, it's normal. We already talked about this. I don't know what agreement you and aunt Brunhilda had, but this house is now legally ours. And you... have to move out. We have nowhere to go! There is space for five families in this house! Five families... There is no point in arguing. If... If we don't come to an agreement, I'll file the lawsuit next week. You are nothing but bourgeois intruders! They will sue us and throw us out. No, I'm not going anywhere! We are not going anywhere! No! We are not going! We're not going anywhere! There's nothing I can do. Maria, listen to me! Leave me alone! I'm not going anywhere. Stinking snitch! I don't care about your lawsuit. Wait, wait! I'm on your side. I'm on your side. What? You are not an ordinary girl. - So? Ordinary girls don't make slingshots, not to mention... hydrogen sulphide bombs. Your parents. Your father wears shabby sweaters. This refers to absent-mindedness. Your knowledge of chemistry. Judging by your own looks... I conclude that they're teachers? Okay. I can help you. Come again? I don't like to live in this creepy house. You want us to leave. And I want to leave. This means we want the same thing. If possible, I'd leave tomorrow. You just want to know my secret plan so you can go tell your mom and dad. What secret plan? The one I'm not telling you about. Suit yourself. So... Your home is a mess. There's nothing that belongs to a woman. Therefore, I conclude that your mother does not live with you. I noted during my observation that a corner of your pillow has mold on it. Maybe from tears. Do you cry into the pillow? Because of your mother? Is she missing? I don't need your help, you nasty Stoneheart. Friends come over and they want to watch a movie together, and you'll have a home cinema upstairs. They can watch it in Erik's room. Come on, honey... Gotcha! What are you doing here? But what are you doing here? That's none of your business. Wait! Turn around! Forget it! You're going to tell on me. I mean it, turn around! - I don't care! Jump in the water and swim home. I'm not allowed to go this far. It's your fault you got in this boat. Please turn around, I have to go back home. I'm not going to turn around! Please! Why? - I'm not going to turn around. Okay, if you want to know... I'm going to look for my mom. What? In this boat? I will save my mother from the pirates. She'll know what to do with you. She will kick you right out! What pirates? - African pirates. She is held captive. This was your secret plan all along? And what if it was? You are going to Africa in this? And so are you. You are completely... Say it. What am I? Do you even know which way Africa is? I know it very well! My mother is an ocea... oceanologist. She studies oceans. We just have to get to the big ships, find one on its way to Africa and ask them to take us on board. As simple as that. Well, it won't start? No. This fog will definitely help us find the big ships. Don't whine so much. Give me my bag. That's the last photo I have of her. What happened to her? Her last expedition was near Cape Verde. That's probably where the pirates attacked them. I need to find a ship called Ouroboros. I think that's where they're keeping her. They took the whole crew hostage. Those guys there. But, how are we supposed to rescue her from the pirates? I have money. How much? - 57 Euros. You know, this is the stupidest plan ever. Shut up! All you do is play your video games. You know nothing of real life! A ship! - We are here! Come here! Hallo! - We're here! Come here! - We're here! Hallo! We are here! - Come here! We are here! - Come here! Here! Awesome. Let's paddle over there. Look! Maybe we should wait for another ship. This one is a little bit too rusty. Forget it! We are going on this one! We are stranded! Are you coming? You can stay here, Stoneheart. Wait! What are you staring at? What are you, in love? How original. - Go on then! Men! We finally got the compass from the White Ship! What's going on? Move! I can't! There are pirates! What pirates? The compass! When you see yourself in the mirror like others see you, then the compass will show you the way. Let's open it! - Wait! What does it mean? I don't see a thing. Do you see me? Only with my right eye. What about in the the mirror? It is just an ordinary mirror! And we still have no reflections! So... Where is the slimefish we took with us from the White Ship? Slimefish? That useless blobfish, the clown! Ah, the clown! Clown? It did seem curious to me that you robbed the White Ship for my sake. Coldshoe, how do you turn it on? Listen, I'm just an actor. See? I didn't ask if you are an actor. I want you to turn it on! I'm seeing this box for the first... ...okay, maybe for the second time. Turn it on! I don't know how! By the way, you have a cool hat. Let's just throw him overboard! Let's throw him overboard! A spy! Catch him! Let me go! Let's find out where he came from! First let's throw him over board! No, let's find out who he is! Let me go! Let's throw him overboard and then... Stop! Stop, wait! Let me go! First overboard! And then... Stop! That's an actor from my troupe. Beloved pirates, I've always thought, I might get a chance to perform to you again. Like in the good old times. Unfortunately, I can't help you with this box. But, you'd still like to see a proper show, right? Let's get back to this! Who is this toadfish... and how did he end up here? A superb question! Meet... my newest troupe member. - Ouch! I can't stand up. My leg hurts. Play along. Your troupe? - Yeah. I achieved a certain mastery as a solo artist and now... Get up! - I can't! What's wrong? - My leg hurts! Stop whining! - Ouch! Your show better be funny! It is! But what shall we do with this box? There is a time for everything. Men, let's forget about the box. But why? Because our ship is called Ouroboros. And our captain is Blackheart! This is it! And the show must go on! Take me to your captain! What? I demand that you take me to your captain. Please! She demands to see our captain. Look, little girl, these two nice fellas will take you to the captain. For real? - For real. Don't be afraid, my little girl. Go on! What's going on here, men? Why are there so many freeloaders on the ship? I will inform the captain that you're here. Please, after you! Let me out! Open up! I'll make a complaint! You! Help me. How's your ingenious plan going? Very good! Did you see the ship's name ― Ouroboros! That's the name I was talking about! My mother is on this ship. It's this one! We have to find the captain... The cursed captain! You mentioned something about the captain? The captain's heart is as cold and dark as the ocean floor. But how do we find him? Maria, this "cold and dark" sounds... Do you want to know a secret? This captain won't take you to the Gate. You have to find it yourself to get out of this world. Okay, but first, can we just get out of this prison. This prison? Why didn't you just say so? Come along then. In there? - Yes. Do you need help? No, I'll take the cane. Okay, suit yourself. Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom! Do you want the pirates to find us? My mother has to be here! Something's wrong here. "Shiny round thing, maybe for preparing food." This is the weirdest museum I've ever been to. What a weird place. Look! A mysterious white slab. To be used with the captain's permit once every 1000 days for 30 seconds. Maria, let's go. Very weird! Why are the mirrors so dirty? How should I know? I know that one! What do you mean? This is my mother's mirror. Maybe it's just similar? No, even my name is written on it. I told you! And you didn't believe me. Maria! I won't go anywhere without my mother. Your mother, here? Alright, let's start from the beginning. Did you find the Mirror Compass? What Mirror Compass? Don't play dumb! You are in the pirates' most sacred room and you are telling me you don't know anything about it? Okay, if we want to escape this place together, we have to help each other out. Agreed? And the lady of your heart can also come with us. What are you doing with this? It's mine! Give it to me! Give it to me! They want to steal back the Mirror Compass! What do you want? We found spies in the mirror room. What? How did they get into the mirror room? I'm asking, where were the guards? That's what I thought. What should we do? Throw you all overboard? Yes! We'll put four men in front of the door. Four men? Very good! Throw the spies overboard! Wait, I'm looking for capt... You know... No need to bother the captain with such a small matter. Throwing overboard ― such a cliché. Wait-wait! Was the artist with the little thieves? What were you doing in the mirror room? I was rehearsing. I plan to extend my troupe. You talk too much. I can't remember, did we throw you overboard the last time because of bad performance or was there something else? Awful child, how are your teeth so sharp? I'm not going anywhere! I'm looking for my mother. What is she talking about? Don't listen her, they're all halfwits! Enough! Mom? Esteemed Captain Blackheart, I didn't notice you before... Coldshoe! - Mom! Wait! - Mom, what's going on here? Mom? I almost remember that word. That means a human, usually a female, who gives birth to offspring. Like them, only smaller at first. Mom! It's me, Maria! Let me go! Mom. I am the captain, not your mother. Captain Blackheart. Throw them overboard! Let's go for a swim! Erik, help me! Come on now! Show her this! - Give it back! If you're not my mother, how did this get here? Everybody, stop! Why have you taken a mirror out from the mirror room? What are you really up to? Captain? Now that I think about it, I would like to know if these little spies have a talent for comedy. Clear the room! Everybody out! Alright. You too! Wait behind the door. And not a word to anyone. You have no idea how long I have waited for you. For us? Yes, for you to save me from the curse of the In-Between-World. What curse? Don't you know where you are? This is the In-Between-World. The world between the world of the living and the world of the dead. Between the world of the living and the world of the dead? Yes. When people die, then normally they board a nice White Ship that takes them to the other side. On the Shore of Eternal Peace. But there are people who cannot go to the other side, They become pirates, like us. What are you doing here? I don't know. That's how it is. If you stay for too long in the In-Between-world, you'll forget your previous life. You don't remember anything? The only thing we know, is the wish to leave this place. How can we save you? Come, I'll show you. There's a legend in our logbook about people with reflections, who can turn the compass on. And each Mirrored One can save one pirate from the In-Between-World. The fog will lift, and the pirate will be free. We are the Mirrored Ones? Coldshoe, did you know that they are the Mirrored Ones? I thought you were an actor, not a liar. Captain, if for once in my life I try to be honest off the stage. Then let me point out, that there are two of them and there are also... two of us. Mom. If we take you back home, will you remember me then? Yes. Where is the Mirror Compass then? In the room with the mirrors. That's right. How did you know? He's always solving puzzles. Let's go there! - Wait a minute. You heard, they put four guards there. But you're the captain. Tell them... It might rouse suspicion. Look, they can only take two pirates with them. But believe me, all the pirates would like to escape this place. What should we do? - Calm down! I have a plan! Men! Everyone got that? And remember: nobody on this ship can know that you are the Mirrored Ones. Today, we saw the White Ship again. Which carries those who are happy. They are not lost in endless fog. Is this fair? No it is not! Why should we be in the fog! But we managed to take the compass! Thank you! For what? If you hadn't remembered the mirror, then... well... You're not a total jerk. How are your feelings treating you? Fine. Why are you here? You are not a pirate! Vanity... My young friend. Look... I was once an actor. But the great fame, as they say, did not come. Then I died and thought it's all over. But suddenly they offered me a thousand year contract on the big White Ship. "Play whatever you want as long as audience has fun!" If you could only imagine what it actually means... People's tastes don't improve even after their death. All they want to see is just some superheroes. Cheap laughs. I feel how I'm... becoming typecast. I'm not developing! Imagine what it's like to play in an act for a thousand years were you're always kicked in the b... ...having a cake smashed in your face. It's the greatest hell, an actor can imagine. Because all I really want is to leave this ship. Or to take arms against the sea of troubles. And, by opposing, end them? To die! To sleep. Perchance to dream. That was from Hamlet. I prefer funny movies. We'll take the final step. Sooner or later, we'll get to the other shore! Up you go. Girl, take the lower bunk. Good. Prepare yourselves. Tomorrow is a very important day. I'm going to sleep now. Don't you remember? I'm going to sleep now. Speak clearly... She probably wants you to tuck her in. How? Take your fingers and press the edges of the blanket. Maybe even fluff the blanket a bit. It depends on the child. - Enough. Ingrid. What? Your name is Ingrid. Ingrid? Yes. I want to see you first thing in the morning. Alright. We'll see tomorrow. Good night! Spit the porridge out of your mouths! Straighten your backs! Lighten up your eyes! Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the show called "Genius and two... Simpletons!" Maria, are you paying any attention? We're supposed to have a rehearsal. But mom promised to come here. Before that she told us to give a performance tonight. I, the director, cannot go on stage with two amateurs who have terrible articulation. Who are amateurs? Next to me, you are all amateurs. I will show you. Stand up. Up, up! So... Are you ready? On your mark, get set and now... act natural! Natural. I told you. I told you, it is hard. If you go on stage like this, everyone will see you are fake. But, I don't want to become an actor. Don't lie! Everyone wants to become an actor. No worries, a little premiere jitters is a part of the process. Getting ready? Good! Well, I'm here. Like we talked yesterday. Let's do our dance. What dance? Come, I'll remind you. Yes, that's right! I'll go and check on the stage construction. You better check out the boat. Very good idea, captain! Could you leave us alone? As you wish. Wait for me. Well? Isn't your company needed anymore? Are you jealous? Yeah right! Let's go check on the boat. Erik, don't be sad. Girls just need some time. Watch your toes with the barrel! Otherwise, good job fellas! Wait! What is "the Gate"? How do you know about the Gate? I just do. You're not asking anything just because. Yes, I do. Why can't you tell me? What are you doing here? Where's Coldshoe? I'm asking you ― where's Coldshoe? Voila! Hello! We're preparing for tonight's show. Really? For a moment I thought you were checking the rescue boat engine. Me and an engine? Permission to laugh! I don't like actors who aren't natural. What did I tell you? I didn't know we have a theatre critic on board. Okay, let's do it again! But this time, sing along. Well, Erik? Scared? No! I'm just... I'm not sure about my acting skills. Dear pirates, I'm happy to present my new troupe! "Two Simpletons and the Genius." Please, welcome to the stage The two Simpletons! Welcome to the stage! Thank you! One minute! One minute, please! Well? What's taking so long? The audience awaits. I heard that last time they threw rotten tomatoes at you. That's how modern theatre works. Your task is very simple, act natural! Let's do it one more time. And now ― the barrel! Barrel! Barrel! Barrel... Voila! Thank you! It's empty. Simpletons, climb in! Into the barrel! Get in! Hurry up! Sword, please! This time we have rotten apples instead of rotten tomatoes! Can I have one, too? - Sure! If it's for throwing, I want one, too. Let's go, or we'll be late. Clear the way! Stop playing with your little swords. What was that? A bomb, of course. Okay, let's find the compass. It should look like a suitcase. I know, I saw it when we came aboard. It's here! How do you know? - I just do. How do we turn it on? The big pirate on the deck said: "If you see yourself from the mirror like others see you." Actually, it's written here: "If you see yourself in the mirror room like others see you. Then the Mirror Compass will show you the way." This is just a regular mirror. There has to be more. What are you looking for? I'm trying to understand, how can other people see you differently. Got it! Can you see yourself from the back? But others can. That's the solution! It's like... a clothing store fitting room. Where in one mirror you see the reflection of the other mirror. Come take a look. Over there! Where did the Simpletons go? A cheap trick! Who do you think we are? That's indeed a good question ― who do I think you are? But, an even better question ― where did the Simpletons go? Where did the Simpletons go? Mouthpiece! What are you doing here? You are missing the show. The mirror room is unguarded. Everybody's watching the show. The mirror room can't be left unguarded. You are right. But it's showtime. Remember, the show must go on! Let's go. The show must go on. Where are the children? Haven't you ever heard of a magic show? The disappearing act! It's a classic. I will show you a classic. Have you ever heard of the right hook? Sounds familiar. Look, over there! The children! Ovations, ovations! You have been an excellent audience! Come back tomorrow! Alright. You two, back to your cabin. You all, clean up. The show is over. You made the mess, you clean it up. I wasn't even that close to the barrel. You heard the captain! It's hard for me! I am not a coldhearted pirate. It's just a role. - Get a grip! You wanted this. I feel sorry for them. Even this little quarrelsome girl Maria has grown on me. She really believes you are her mother and... they hope so sincerely to get back home, but in reality... Isn't it a little late for regret? When you started to manipulate the children, you only wanted to save yourself. Maria! Yes? What? If there are two friends and one wants to tell the other something, but he knows, it would upset the other, should he still tell her? Is it something serious? Yes. Well, it depends on what kind of friends they are. If they are best friends, then he should tell her. Are they best friends? No. Perhaps they will be. You look so funny. Where is the Mirror Compass? Is this it? The captain won't take you to the Gate! They hope to get home, but... What happened? It was working before. It works only in the hands of the Mirrored Ones. Erik solved the puzzle. We went to the Mirror room... and then a beam came out of the compass... Where are you going? I need to use the bathroom. Hurry up. Don't let the pirates see you. I won't. Through the Gate, which leads to the Shore of Eternal Peace. The Mirrored One's fatal one-way boat ride. When a Mirrored One and a pirate step through the Gate, the pirate will find his peace... But the Mirrored Ones will die and never return home. Dear mom and dad, we are trapped in the In-Between-World. Please, come and help me! Gotcha! Now tell me everything. I have nothing to tell. Spit it out! Or I'll tell the captain you were reading the logbook. Oh squid! Stop! Aha! Stop wiggling! Start talking! No way! A Mirrored One. That's why... Ouch! We found a Mirrored One! A Mirrored One? Are you sure? Look at his reflection! You idiots! It's just... Just another of the artist's tricks. This is a trick mirror. So I will take him back to Coldshoe. Tomorrow you'll all see a new magic show. I'll take the boy now. Hold on! Let's see what the captain has to say about it. The boy stays. The boy stays! Don't touch Tiny! Get off me! What? Enough already? The pirates are after me! What pirates? All of them! - Then we run! Go back! They ran that way! Men, let's get those Mirrored Ones! Coldshoe! Is the boat working? - I did my best. We'll find out soon. The compass! Give me the compass! Give me the compass or I'll turn you all into spiced sprat. Hand me the compass. - But... Give it to me! Hurry up! Put it down. Very good. The boy too. Erik! Captain! Hold on! Erik! Erik, what are you doing? My mom is still there! Give it to me! I won't! Let me go! - Give it to me! Get off me! Captain! - Wait! Help me on board... Captain! You promised! I only have two Mirrored Ones. Climb in! Start the engine! Hurry up! Now! - It won't start! It must be broken! I am a genius! Where is the compass? No, don't do it! Erik, what are you doing? I read the logbook, they're lying! Give it to me! Maria, listen to me! Why are you doing this? - Doing what? You really have a heart made of stone. Captain is my mother and we're on our way home! This is not one of your puzzles! Why won't you believe me? We're friends! I wouldn't wish a friend like you for my worst enemy. Good girl! Turn it on! That way! Yes, captain! Come on, let's go! This is it? - Yes! Let's go! I haven't seen or touched land for such a long time. It was in another life! I'm so used to swaying, I can't keep my balance on land! Wait for me! And you didn't believe her! Look! Do you now recognise our home? Come, let's make some pancakes. Pancakes? - Yes, Pop likes them... Did I hear somebody mention pancakes? In the kitchen. Mom! Mom! Dad! I'm home! Mom, dad! What's happening here? Erik! Be careful! This is not your home. I'd forgotten that waiting for pancakes is so boring. This is not my room. What do you mean? Isn't this your home? We're still in the In-Between-World. I need to warn Maria! What are you doing? Stay back! Erik, what's wrong with you? Stay back! I figured it out, you lied! You told us we can get back home! But we never going to! - Are you okay? Stay there! I figured it out! You only needed me to get out of the In-Between-World. Well...? Well what? You have to sacrifice me to get out of this world. Erik. Are you afraid of me? But that was your plan. Yeah. I didn't think it through properly. What it would actually mean for you. The part where you'd dissolve into million molecules. And melt together with the eternal universe. What are you saying? Erik. You are free to go. What about Maria? It's a bit more complicated for her. Why? What do you think the curse of the pirates is about? When people die, then some of them get trapped in the In-Between-World. But why? Because living people hold them in their thoughts. What do you think, who is holding the captain in the In-Between-World? Maria! One, two, three. Well done, let's try again! One, two... - Maria! Very good, let's do it again! What's happening to her? Tricks of the In-Between-World. They are starting to forget. Now, we need an ancient trick. Wiser than all the legends. Ouch! Erik? Maria, I have to show you something. What? - Come! Maria, where are you going? Wait for me, I'll be right back. Where are you taking me? You'll see. Have you been to aunt Brunhilda's room? Why do you ask? - Answer. Yes, she used to invite me over. Is this the room exactly like you remember it? Yes, it is! You have been in this room, but not with my stuff in it. The boxes were next to the mirror and the globe. Where are they? So what? Also, my father took that picture down. Who put it back there? Just stop it! Maria, please listen to me. You haven't heard my parents talking. You have only heard their mumble through the walls. For you they are like thin air, you could easily walk through. This is stupid. Maria, please listen to me. - What? We are still in the In-Between-World. This here is your fantasy, and not our house. Here we go again! Step aside! Maria! One last thing. - Well? Have you ever looked in this cupboard? No. Come here! Maria, please, come. Please. Okay, if this is our house, then this cupboard should have aunt Brunhilda's stuff in it. Open it. Erik, what is that? No idea... I think it is the Gate. What gate? - You know... The Gate! Where the compass led us. No. - Maria! The compass was never meant to... Stop it! It was meant to... - Don't touch me! Maria, please! The compass was never meant to take us back home. Shut up! It was only to take dead people to the other side. Shut up! Stop it! I just wanted to go home. Maria, is it you who wants to go where dead people go? No. - Then who does? Who wanted to turn on the compass? Maria... Look, Maria. What I want to say... is that... That my mother is dead. Maria! Maria! Maria! I remember everything. I remember you. I remember everything now. I also remember... that storm. What are you talking about? Come here. What just happened? Maria finally admitted to herself that her mother is dead. So the curse is broken and her mother is free to board the White Ship. I won't let you go! We could stay here together. I don't care where we are, as long as we're together. Maria... You saw what became of me in this world. We will quickly forget who we are. Who we are to each other. It's an endless agony. Captain, they're waiting for you. I will come with you. Maria, don't talk like that. I forbid you, Maria. I want you to live. Who else will make pancakes for Pop? Maria, if you go with her, you'll never come back... I don't care. Then I will come with you! What? I have never had a friend. You don't even like me! You don't care about anyone! You have a heart of stone! Nobody has a heart of stone. Erik, I knew... Please, tell Pop that I still love him. Very much. Both of you. Please, tell him. I will always be with you. How? Take this with you. So you won't forget. I won't forget. Mom! How will I get back to Pop? You will know. I can see it. Erik will show you. What are you going to do now? I should get on that ship too. Maybe the In-Between-World is the right place for an actor like me. How can we get back home? You need to show that you're alive. It was a pleasure to have met you, Erik Stoneheart. And you too, Maria Sharptooth! Did you understand what we must to do now? No. Mom said you would know... I don't. Don't let go of my hand. I won't. Are you okay? We'll take you back to the shore. Take the life jackets. Is everything OK? Maria, I read your letter. I know you went to look for your mother. I need to tell you something. Your mother... When she went to that expedition... I already know. You do? And she wanted me to tell you that she still loves you. Nothing has changed. What are you talking about? You don't believe me? She gave me this. There's my name on it. What's going on here? Don't you worry, honey-bunny. We know it wasn't your fault. It was that girl. Do you love me? What? Do you love me? Of course, Erik! Of course we love you. If you really love me, there are some things I'd like to ask you. Firstly, from now on, please don't call me blueberry muffin or honey bunny or sweet dumpling... And secondly... Maria and Pop will stay in their home. Maria is my friend and I like her. Alright, sugarm... I mean, Erik. We just want you to be happy. Actually, you can call me sugar muffin, but only when we're at home. Ah, there you are. Here's your glass. Nobody has a heart of stone. It would be too heavy to carry. For one thing. Secondly, you are truly alive only when your heart feels something. Well, actually you're alive only when you can take somebody's hand. Erik? Yes? - Let's go to the beach! Coming! Erik? Well done! You're welcome! Go, go now! Don't keep her waiting! Let's go! Where're you going? We're just... Don't stay too long. Hold on! Let's jump in the sea! Let's go!
