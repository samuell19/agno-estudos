INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY İSTANBUL 1963 Dad, can you speed up a little? I don’t want to be late. Are you trying to get me fined? We’re late again. See, the bell’s rung. If you’d been ready in time we wouldn’t be late. Dad! Are you alright? Am I dead? How about this? We text every day. We’re meeting this weekend. Come on, Can. How many have there been? You get bored in a week. Online dating doesn't work. What do you mean? That’s how me and Kerem met. Right, sweetie? I had a dream last night I wish it had lasted a lifetime Everything was so wonderful On a path filled with stars Kerem… Hey, Kerem. -Let’s go. -We will. We were walking hand-in-hand Somewhere above the clouds Come on. Come on. The light in your eyes Like nothing I’d seen before Brighter than the sun, believe me DEAR SEMA I LOVE THAT SONG YOU SANG. I FEEL SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLE. I HADN’T HEARD IT FOR YEARS. Good morning. Yes, Senem? Seen what? I don’t understand. I’m about to go into class. Facebook? See you this evening. Thank you, Dad. See you. Sema! There’s a letter for you. Thanks, Tahsin. You can go now. Is that a letter? "Could I invite you for a chat? Niko." Good morning, teacher. Watch it! Trying to run us over? Sema, did he look at you? Whatever do you mean? That boy gave you a look. I thought he was going to talk you. Is that letter from him, too? What letter? What does it say? It says what it says. Get going. I swear he looks like Alain Delon. Alright, Ecem. That’s enough for today. See you tomorrow, okay? Defne, are you okay? Did you know? Tell the truth. How was I supposed to know? He works at the same school. You must have heard. Well… I heard something but this was unexpected. What are you doing? Gokhan got me these. Why am I still wearing them? You’re right. Why? I don’t believe it. Okay. -Enough. -What are you doing? Don’t follow him. -What are you doing? -Deleting him. I’m unfriending him. Deleted. "Friend Request from Kerem." -Who’s this Kerem? -I don’t know. But I have to say. The guy’s gorgeous. So handsome. Do you know him? I think he was in the audience last night. He sent you messages. Have you looked? No, Senem. I didn’t. Then look at them, Defne. It’s been a whole year. You’ve closed yourself off. You don’t give anyone a chance. The guy got married. Okay? It’s over and done. Time to look around. Flirt a little. What about dating? Dating who? Who can I trust anymore? Six years! You’re like a broken record. "Six years." -Give me that. -What are you doing? Look, it’s easy. Just press the button. "Accept." I don’t believe you. Chill out. Give it a try. You don’t have to marry him. Senem, what have you done? I LOVE THAT SONG YOU SANG. I HADN’T HEARD IT FOR YEARS. He says, good morning. Write something back. YOU WERE AMAZING ON STAGE LAST NIGHT. WHEN ARE YOU PERFORMING AGAIN? What am I doing? For goodness sake. I’m letting you egg me on. I don’t know him. Know what you should do? Go home, crawl under a blanket, and cry. Then look at old photos of you and Gokhan. OK? Keep coming at me. OK? You deserve worse. Don’t. We’re at school. We’ll be home this evening. I want to hear all about it. Write something. -You scared me. -Write… -Write a reply. -Get going already. -I’ve got my eye on you. Write. -Go. You’re going to reply. HELLO. WE'RE AT SESS TONIGHT. SUPER. SEE YOU THERE? KISMET. -Good morning, my love. -Good morning. -Are you leaving right away? -Yes. I’ll make dinner and we can watch a film tonight. -What do you say? -I’ve already got plans. What plans? Excuse me. No asking Mr. Kerem about his plans, right? At least have some tea first, OK? Okay. Who were you texting just now? Aylin, are you kidding me? I don’t like being interrogated. Don’t do it. I was just asking. Alright, I’ve got to go. See you. Kerem, how long are we going to go on like this? Aylin, what is it at this time of morning? What is it? It’s this, I wake up and you’re on the couch. It makes me feel bad. We talked about this a million times. I can’t sleep in bed with anyone. Am I just anyone, Kerem? I don’t want to fight. I really don’t want to fight. I’m not fighting. I’m trying to have a conversation, like two adults. But Mr. Kerem can’t be questioned. Don’t ask, don’t speak. Don’t upset Mr. Kerem. You’ll drive him away. Don’t scare him off. There are two of us here, right? I’m here too. Do you remember the day we met? I told you I was no good at relationships. You said, okay. Remember? But a year has passed. Do you realize it’s been a year? That makes it a relationship What am I supposed to do? What do you want from me? I’m doing all I can. Is there someone else? Fine. Go hang out with her. You’ll come back in the end. I’m no good for you. Don’t you realize that? If I upset you so much let’s stop seeing each other. Stop seeing each other. It’s easy to say, isn’t it? I love you, you jerk. I want a relationship. I want to be lovers. I don’t want to go on like this. Why can’t you understand? I’m sorry. I’ve been selfish. And for that I apologize. But I don’t feel the way you do. Which is why I don’t feel like changing the way I act. You’re a great person. I’m sure there are a lot of guys who would make you happy but I’m not that guy. What are you going to say next? "It’s me, not you?" Tell me I deserve better. Use every cliché there is. Kerem, fuck off. -Get out! -Fine. The government has presented Cyprus with a diplomatic note to protest the latest speech by Cypriot leader Makarios. What a shame. The troubles never stop. After noting that the comments by the Cypriot president supporting union between Greece and Cyprus violated the current agreement, the response to Makarios That boy, huh? Which boy, Dad? Get away from the window. "Which boy?" she says. Isn’t that one who fell in front of us? He didn’t fall. We hit him, Dad. All right. Whatever. What’s he doing here? How am I supposed to know? Sema, have you finished breakfast? Yes, Mom. Go upstairs and do your homework. Go on. Go do your homework. …he said no Turkish government would ever permit Turkish Cypriots to be governed arbitrarily by a foreign country. Mom, I’m going to Ayla’s to do my homework. Don’t stay out late. Alright. See you later. Tahsin, come on. Here. Niko, I want my reward. Really, Tahsin? You’re a champ. Way to go. Her first letter. May God clear your path till marriage. Amen. Tahsin, take this and scram. Get out of my sight. "Of what do you wish to speak?" Niko, everything alright? What’s going on? Tahsin gave some good news, Master. Go on without me, girls. I’ll join you later. Were you waiting for me? You asked what I wanted to talk about. I came here to tell you. All right. Go on. We’ll talk about anything you want. But why should I talk to you? You don’t know me. I don’t know you. It’s better that way. We have a lot to talk about. Besides, I do know you. You’re Sema. Policeman Kemal’s daughter. You’re in 10th grade. So, you’ve done your research. I gave Tahsin some marbles, and that was that. You’ve gone to such trouble. I’m late. If you’ll excuse me. Shall we take a walk? Whatever do you mean? We can’t talk here. I thought we could go down to the Bosphorus. You don’t understand. I don’t walk about with strangers. Good day. Okay. Then let’s get acquainted. I’m Niko. Niko Kazanidis. Born and raised in Istanbul. But we’ve reached my neighborhood. Please don’t follow me. I help Master Ali at the auto shop. I’m fascinated by engines. I graduated a bit late from high school. My father’s name is Yorgo. He has a fabric shop in Pera. We’re passing the barber shop. Someone might see us. Please. My father’s good-natured. He gets along with everyone. Marika, that’s my mother’s name. She’s a great cook. You’d love her food. I’m very good at football. Elvis. I love Elvis and Sinatra. And that new group, The Beatles. I like them a lot, too. And I’m single. Can we go on a walk now? You’re most peculiar. Do you think I know you now? But you are very hasty. You have a whole lifetime to get to know me. As if you have never left, As if you've always been here Like a secret hidden from everyone Like nestling with me, softly sobbing You are always with me As though exonerating me from something Like smelling a flower Without picking it Like enduring prohibitions You are in my thoughts Not in the past, but now I live you You are always with me In my days and in my nights Don’t play, don’t sing it You are my songs Take this and give me two tequilas. Hello. You recognized me. Bravo. You’ve checked out my profile. Of course I did. Naturally. And you looked at mine. Naturally. -Tequila? -Sure. You sang beautifully. Well done. Thanks. I don’t normally do this. I mean, meeting on the Internet… …isn’t really my thing. I see but that’s not really what happened. We sort of met yesterday. Our eyes met, at least. True. You’ve got a great voice. You already said that. -What do you do? -I cook. Really? I’ve got a place on Tunus. Drop by one day. Are you from Ankara? No, I… …was born in Istanbul. When I was accepted to the school of music I came to Ankara. And I stayed here. You? It’s a little complicated but I grew up in Ankara. Have you got a boyfriend? I’ve quit. What do you mean? Lovers, boyfriends and similar products, I’ve sworn off them. Two more tequilas. I see. I’m not just talking about sex But that’s part of it. Like translating a poem for you Written in Turkish I got lost in your hair Got scorched on your lips Was scattered by your wind Come and stop me, if you wish I knew you’d come You saw me through your lens But I fled my real self I was lost I knew you’d come But I fled my real self You saw me through your lens You got lost with me You got lost with me "Would you be mine?" -Come on. -Mom. Good morning. Good morning. Sema, where are you going? The corner store, Mom. I’m famished. -I’ve got to go. -Okay. I am not saying you can't… "Dear Sema…" "There’s a Turkan Soray and Ediz Hun movie playing tomorrow night." "If you went with me, I’d be the happiest guy in the world." "Seeing you once a day isn’t enough anymore." "Would it help if I begged?" "If we could talk for five minutes." "Beloved Sema, this is the first time I call you beloved." "I hope you are not offended." "Beloved. It means the loved one." "It means, you." "Is there any reason for waiting to express my feelings?" "By expressing them, are they cheapened?" "I can’t hold back, not when merely writing to you brings me such joy." "I hope this letter brings you joy, too." "With the deepest love and longing. Niko." DO NOT ANSWER -Good morning. -Good morning. I’m running late. Wait, I’ll drop you off. Really? Why don’t you believe me? -No touching. -Why not? Then we can’t get out of bed. -Back off. -You’re right. See you then. Shall we have dinner? -Tonight? -I mean, if you’re free. But we’ve spent two days together. So what? Okay. I’ll call when I leave work. Alright. My lipstick looks good on you. Ahmet asked the grocer about me yesterday. Neriman told me. He lives on the street below. We run into each other sometimes. What are you doing here? I’m working as a guide. As a guide? Right this way, miss. Do you know the love story of Dafne and Apollo. No, I don’t. Legend has it that Apollo mocked Eros’s archery skills Eros was furious. He prepared two arrows. One would inspire love in the person it pierced. The other would cause revulsion. Eros wounded Apollo with one of the arrows. To make him fall in love. My teacher’s coming. Come on. Then Apollo saw beautiful Dafne in the forest one day. So lovely was Dafne’s smile that Apollo was lovestruck on the spot. But Dafne hid from him. For an arrow had pierced her, too. Eros’s other arrow. That’s sad. Were they never together? Exhausted from fleeing, Dafne begged the gods to end her suffering. They took pity and turned her into a tree. The "daphne" tree. Laurel. Apollo continued to love Dafne even though she was a tree. "Distance is a terrible thing." "Never knowing if one is missed or is forgotten." Beautiful. Excerpts from your favorite authors? Writers, poets, big brothers. Generally. -Thank you. -Have a seat. -Did you make all these? -Yes. Wow. See if you like them. Where should I start? With the walnut one. -How do you take your raki? -A bit more than a single. -This is wonderful. -Enjoy. We’ve got other ones, too. I want to taste them all. Thank you. When did you start this place? Almost four years ago. Of course. I mean I spent my childhood here and I visit Istanbul now and then but Ankara’s nice. What did you study? Industrial design, at METU. I worked in the corporate world for a while but wasn’t into it. Then I had this opportunity. I said, why not? And I’m still here. -To meeting you. -To meeting you. Everyone in your profession moves to Istanbul. -Why are you here? -I don’t know. Ankara is quieter, more relaxed. I’ve never heard of anyone moved from Istanbul to Ankara and not moving back. Well, now you have. Okay, here’s the reason. I was in a relationship while I was studying. We were in the same faculty. We later broke up, of course. But I’d grown to like the school and the kids. That’s why I stayed here. The kids adore you. Really? If I had a music teacher like you I’d stay in school forever. You think I’m joking, right? Where’s your family? I lost my mom five years ago. My father died when I was a child. -My condolences. -Thank you. I lost my dad in my senior year of high school. My condolences to you, too. Thank you. Are you a little tense? No, actually. I’m dazed. Everything happened so fast. I don’t know what you think. I’m not thinking anything. I like you a lot. I mean I don’t know what the future holds but things are great right now. I like you, too. Is that why you’re tense? I feel uneasy. I haven’t let anyone into my life for a long time. What’s happening now? What will happen tomorrow? We don’t really know each other. You’re right. But I’m no different. I mean, I haven’t been close to anyone for quite a while. But something amazing happens when I’m with you. I am really attracted to you, Defne. Are you always this sweet, or just until you get what you want. Who hurt you this much? -Who made you lose trust? -Never mind that. He was an idiot, whoever he was. I was the idiot. What are you doing? Everyone’s looking at us. Let them. Do you know why they’re looking? None of them have ever… …seen me like this. That’s why. If only you could relax and forget the past. Let’s enjoy the moment. Alright? Alright. You… …are the most talented, beautiful woman I’ve ever laid eyes on. And I’m a lucky man to be here with you right now. I mean, if you hadn’t sung that song I may not have turned and looked at the stage and we wouldn’t be here right now. To coincidences. -Dad… -Yes? I’m completely in love. I can see that, Son. -I’m not blind. -It’s that obvious? It certainly is. Dad, we need to ask for Sema’s hand in marriage. When shall we visit them? Niko, have you ever seen this place so empty? Yannis doesn’t want to keep it open anymore. They’ve been bothering him. They’ve told him to leave. -Why, Dad? -Niko. The lovebirds are circling your head but you don’t realize that some would shoot those birds. Do you never read the paper, listen to the radio? I know what’s going on. But they know us here. Our neighbors like us. They know we’ve got nothing to do with the events in Cyprus. We belong here, Dad. We’re Istanbulites. And nothing can come between me and Sema. You know that. Listen, Niko. Open your ears and listen. Whether a rock lands on an egg or an egg lands on a rock… it’s the egg that breaks. Be prudent. Stay out of trouble. This is no time for a marriage proposal. Come on, Dad. I tell you I’m in love. And you won’t let me enjoy that, either. How are you? Fine, Timucin. Thank you. You? Me, too. Why aren’t you dancing? I don’t feel like it. Let’s get some refreshments. I don’t feel like it. Thank you. Fine then. Welcome. Thank you. Welcome. -Thank you. -I brought this for you. Mastic liqueur. My mom made it. You shouldn’t have. -Let me take those. -Thank you, Ayla. Take off your jacket. Shall we dance? Alright. I had a dream last night I wish it had lasted a lifetime Everything was so wonderful On a path filled with stars We were walking hand-in-hand Somewhere above the clouds What’s that Greek doing here? Timucin! Don’t any of you read the papers? Do you know what these traitors are doing in Cyprus? I’m not a traitor. Timucin! What are you doing? -Behave yourself! -You behave yourself! -Did you invite him? -Yes, I did! Then tell him to get lost! -That’s enough, Timucin! -Look here, buddy! I’m Niko. If you’ve got a problem, deal with me. -Leave Sema out of it. -Get out of here. Niko… Come on, Niko. Forgive me, please. I had no idea that would happen. I put you in a terrible situation. I don’t care. You took my hand… …and nothing else matters. Defne, how’s it going? Fine. How are you? Why are you here? To see you. Why? You never say "hi" anymore when you see me. Really? Sorry. I didn’t realize. Congratulations, by the way. What are you doing tonight? Shall we have some raki? Sure. But bring your wife along. And I’ll bring my boyfriend. The four of us. What do you say? Are you out of your mind? What raki? Defne we really need to talk. I miss you. I missed you once. Over time, it goes away. Don’t worry. I hope I’m not disturbing you? No. Gokhan came to the wrong class. He was just leaving. -Hello. -Hello. -Kerem. -Hi. Say hi to your wife for me. Can I get you a drink? After six years, just as we were talking about marriage I find out that Gokhan has another lover. He was stringing us both along. What does he want from you now? How do I know? He said he missed me and invited me for a drink. You mean, you sometimes meet him for a drink? No. Why would I do that? Yes, why would you do that? Do you still have feelings for him? No. I don’t feel a thing. You know what? I’m glad. I’m glad he cheated on me. I’m glad he got married. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have met you. That’s right. Still, let me know if he bothers you again. Oh my. What are you going to do? Beat him up? Come on. You work at the same place. Just tell me if he bothers you. That’s all. Kerem… …come a little closer. -Yes? -Hold my hand. Okay. Are you jealous? -Why don’t you move in with me? -What? Why should I do that? I want to wake up next to you every morning. I can’t. What if we fight or get bored? Why would we fight? -All the classic reasons. -For example? Well… Who does the cleaning up? Why are you so noisy in the morning? -You’re in my space. -In my space? You weigh 45 kilos. How much space could you take up? If that’s all you’ve got, there’s no real problem. Could you give me a pen? -What are you doing? -Writing the rules. The rules for living together. Number one. No matter what, no lies. No lies. -Okay. Two. -Two. No putting pressure on each other. -I think that’s enough. -No. Number three. -I do the cooking. -I’d be grateful. Four, I get to shower first. -Is that all? -I think that’s enough. It’s a deal. Hi, Mom. How are you, dear? I’m fine, what about you? I’m fine. How’s Kerem. He’s fine, too. We’re at home right now. Have you got used to it? -Nothing’s wrong, is it? -We have. It’s going good. So, he might make you a proposal soon, then? I don’t think so. We’re fine like this. Defne, I was thinking about coming to Ankara this weekend. -What do you say? -This weekend. Sure. -Sure. I’m glad you’re coming. -See you soon. Give my best to Kerem. I will. He says his to you, too. -Goodbye. Kisses… -Kisses to you, too. -My mom’s coming this weekend. -You don’t say. What should we do? Would she be comfortable here? We’ll stay at Senem’s. But we’ll all have dinner together. You can meet, if you want. I do. I mean, of course. The new decree states that real estate obtained after 1936 by minority foundations can now be rightfully owned. The Greeks killed 11 people in the Kumsal district of Nicosia, Cyprus. Four were family members of Medical Corps Major Nihat Ilhan. Turn it up. Ilhan’s family was found dead in the bathtub. His wife Muruvvet and their children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan. The statement from the prime ministry expressed condolences to the victims’ families and warned of grave consequences for Greece. Dinner’s ready. Cyprus is Turkish! Cyprus will stay Turkish! O heavenly father hallowed be thy name. Bless this bounty for you are holy now and ever and forever. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation. Take the departed into heaven. And give the bereaved patience. Free us of hatred and vengeance. May brotherhood and peace prevail. Amen. Verse 8 of Surah Al-Ma’idah says… …o ye who believe… …stand firm for Allah. Be witnesses in justice. Be just. "If you look for a flaw, all the mirrors are at your service." said Rumi. It is in times of acrimony and violence that your faith is truly tested. Do you stay on the path of righteousness, and not discriminate? Or do you succumb to rage and respond to the barbarity in Cyprus by wreaking revenge on our innocent Greek brothers? -Kemal. -Yes? Does it befit the state’s policeman? What are you talking about, Riza? Your daughter is openly flirting with a Greek boy. They’ve been seen in public. Riza, if the hodja’s sermon is so lost on you don’t take up space at the mosque. At least don’t defend her. I’m doing just that. Stop minding my daughter and start minding your sons, who are attacking your neighbors. Turkish fatalities in the Cyprus conflict have reached 30. A few shops were damaged in disturbances in Beyoglu. PM Inonu declared that the state cannot guarantee the safety of the Greek population in Turkey. Good day to you, Master Ali. Welcome, Kemal. Thank you. Anything wrong, Kemal? You recall the events of September, ten years ago? How could I forget? Those were terrible days. We’re headed there again, Ali. I’ve got no problem with Greeks. But my daughter isn’t safe with him. As his master, I’m asking you to box his ears and change his mind about her. Sir, Sema is safe with me. -I give my word of honor. -Hold on, Niko. Don’t interrupt. In fact, I’ll come and ask for her now if you allow it. You heard me. That’s my final word. Good day. Goodbye, Kemal. Son… Don’t you know better? He really blew his top. So be it. I’m marrying Sema. You’ll see. I’ve got to practice. Who’s telling you not to. Stop acting spoilt. Spoilt? Your phone’s ringing. "Do not answer?" Who’s that? Nobody important. Darling. Tell me who you recorded as "Do not answer". Someone I don’t want to talk to, dear. Dear? -Where are you going? -Out for some air. We were going to watch a film. We were. But I need some air. See you. When are you coming home? I don’t know, dear. Don’t wait up. Okay, be careful. I love you. See you. That girl was horrible. -What girl? -The one I met. I don’t know if it’s photoshop, but I’m sick of it. Everyone on social media is a model, a star. You meet, and there’s nothing to say. All visuals, no sound. Kerem doesn’t have to deal with any of that now. He’s got a girlfriend. He’s cooped up at home. Do we have to talk like this? As soon as someone's in a relationship-- It’s nothing like that. Look, he’s not ribbing me. Let’s go camping this weekend. A tent, barbecue. -I’m busy this weekend. -What are you doing? What is it? Defne’s mother is coming. I’m meeting her. It’s all over. She’s got Kerem now. Let’s capture this moment forever. -You love doing that. -Come closer. Hi. Hi Aylin. Give me a beer. How’s it going with your new girlfriend? Good. Thanks. What’s up with you? Nothing. "I can’t manage a relationship." "The problem’s me, not you." Blah, blah, blah. WHEN WILL YOU BE HOME DARLING? Is that what you tell her, too? See you, Aylin. Guys, I’m out of here. See you. Let’s see, then. -Is she drunk? -As a skunk. Is this cab free? Kerem. -Are you leaving because of me? -You’re drunk. Get in. I’ll take the next one. -Come with me. -Don’t be ridiculous! I miss you a lot. Aylin, I didn’t want to hurt you. And I never lied to you. I didn’t plan for this to happen. But it did. I’m sorry. Get in. Come with me. Come on. Just one night. Haven’t you missed me too? Defne… I love you so much. No harm comes of love, Kemal. Let them date. Not a chance! There’s no way! They will not see each other! -She’s in the next room. -She’s not allowed outside! I’ll keep her out of school if I must! You’re saying we should shun them too? They’re our neighbors. We should support them more. Nuran, you refuse to understand. Today or tomorrow the Greeks will be thrown out. What will you tell your daughter then? How will you comfort her? I understand, Kemal. But they’re young. They’re young. I know that too. But I’m asking you again. Asking until I’m hoarse. When they’re thrown out how do you intend to comfort her? Alright, calm down. Mind your blood pressure. I am calm. Those lowlifes! To do that to children? Damn them all! Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Come again. -Good day. -Good day. Welcome, Nuran. What are you looking for? I’m not here for fabric, Yorgo. This way, please. -Would you like to drink something? -No, thank you. As you know, our children are dating. My husband is concerned. Could you have a word with Niko and let him know to stay away until things calm down. Do you think I haven’t spoken to him? All he can speak of is Sema. Are you alright? I’m fine, Yorgo. I’m fine. God protect us. Protect my husband and son. May we not have to emigrate. We have suffered much but still we stayed. O Lord, this is our home where we belong. We’re no harm to anyone. Nobody benefits from war. Forgive us our sins. Give us the strength to accept what we cannot change. Give us courage. O Lord, I implore you. Amen. Sema… …consider this an engagement present. Niko, if anyone saw this I couldn’t explain it. Why, Sema? I overheard my parents. They’re sending you away. That’s what Dad told Mom. There’s no such thing. We’re not going anywhere. And this has happened before. I was little. They broke into the shop. Dad was nearly killed. A Turkish neighbor saved us. He got in front of dad and said, "If you touch Yorgo, I’ll kill you." Dad decided right then not to leave with the others. To stay in Istanbul. So don’t get upset, okay? No matter what, we will never be apart. At least take this. Until the day we get married. Dear, shall we take your Mom to the restaurant or would you prefer somewhere else? What did you do last night, Kerem? What did I do? We agreed, no lies. I’m not lying. I was at the bar with the guys and Aylin was there, too. It was a coincidence. You’re seeing your ex and not telling me, is that it? Are you out of your mind? We bumped into each other, I said. You didn’t invite me because you knew you’d see her. Are you calling me a liar? Look, Kerem someone listed as "do not answer" is calling. Why would anyone record that? Then you run off and meet her purely by chance. If you want to see Aylin… This is getting out of control. We’re both upset. And I’m in a hurry. -So you’re running away. -I’m not running away. You’re accusing me of something and you’re not listening. -We agreed, no lies. -I’m not lying, Defne! Then who is "do not answer"? Nobody. Back off, Defne. You’re right. I’m bothering you. You’re right. Defne, what are you doing? I’m leaving you in peace, Kerem! Senem’s got a spare room. Enjoy the peace and quiet. Hang out. What did I say? It hasn’t even been two months. And we’re fighting. And what did I say? -What did I tell you? -What? We might fight, but we can talk it through. I’m not lying to you. Nothing happened with Aylin. Look, this is hard for me, too. We’re in a relationship, Defne. We live together. We share everything. I’m having trouble adapting, too. It’s the same for you. But if you leave at the first fight… Come here. Come. I’m sorry I shouted. Please don’t lie to me. Mom, what’s going on? Niko, come here. We have 48 hours to leave Turkey. They’re throwing us out, Niko. Greeks who lack Turkish citizenship are permitted to take $22 and 20 kilos of possessions along with this document… No. We’re not leaving, Dad. Dad, this is our home. $22. What are we supposed to do with $22? Mom, stop it. Don’t, Son. Don’t… Dad, say something. We have no choice, Son. We can’t make a living here. We’re leaving tomorrow. We’re not going anywhere, Dad! We haven’t hurt anyone! We’re not going anywhere. Understand? They can’t do this! Understand? They can’t do this! -They can’t! -Niko! It’s that Greek, isn’t it? Hey! Greek! Piss off, the whole lot of you! Where to? Huh? This is my home. This is my neighborhood. We’re Istanbulites! -Scum! -Understand! What’s going on? Stop it! Disperse! -Quick! Scram! -Niko! Sema, come here. -Disperse! -Mom, Niko. Niko! -Go inside! -Sema. -I said, go inside! -Take her inside! Niko, get up, my boy. Niko. I told you, inside! Niko, please go home. I’m begging you. Get inside! Inside! Niko. Sir, I need to see Sema. If you want what’s best for Sema you’ll never see her again. Understood? -Sir… -Drop the "sir". If you want what’s best for my daughter you’ll never see her again. Take this. Now go home. Go on. Go home. Go on. Niko, cover them. I don’t have the strength. Eleni, keep an eye on our house. Water the plants. Here’s the key. We’ll be back in a couple months. Don’t worry. Yorgo? Niko! Mom? Are you alright, Dad? I’m fine. Fine. Come on. Careful. Careful. Come on, Mom. Tahsin, could you give this to Niko? Tahsin, what is it? They’re gone. Niko. Niko! Niko! They left. Run and you’ll catch up. Niko! The buses leave from Eminonu. "Beloved Sema, bidding you farewell hurts most of all." "But we have to leave." "We’re going." "Even knowing we’ll be strangers there as well." "Beloved Niko, forgive me for not wearing the ring you gave me." "I, too, wish to be with you forever." "We can get married the day I turn 18." "They’ll do everything to separate us." "Let them." "Distance, roads and borders might divide us." "However, there’s one thing they can’t do." "They can’t stop these words of love from touching your hands, eyes and heart." "Is the world so cruel?" "What is it they can’t share?" "What is it they kill for?" "Must we part because others want war?" "They can’t stop me from treasuring your memory forever." "Until I can once again look into your eyes, I will carry your eyes and laughter in my heart." -Let go. I’m shivering. -Hand it over, madame! "God created the world without borders." "Why do we divide it?" "If we love each other, why won’t they let us be?" "Leaving without even a farewell, without one last look, without saying how much I love you." "However this is not a final farewell." "Farewell wouldn't suit us." "One day, I’ll find a way to come and get you." "If I ask you, will you wait for me?" "Do I have the right?" "The moment I saw you, I felt my life would change." "You’re my destiny, Niko." "I take your smiling eyes with me." "Every time I look at the sky I seem to be looking into your eyes." "With God’s help I know we will meet again." "I have full faith." "You are my destiny, Sema." -Here we are. -Welcome. Thank you. We’re both guilty We dragged it out We did enough harm to love -Defne. -Can. -Nice to meet you. -Likewise. How are you? Like a winter that never arrives I’ll be right back. What is love A love of captivity For us, not being able to leave He’ll definitely come tonight. What if he brings his girlfriend? Won’t it bother you? Kerem? Not at all. He doesn’t take the girl out. He was alone the other night, too. You know what Kerem’s like. Why are you asking that? Things start off fine. He gets bored in a couple months. He starts tripping over not being able to have a relationship. Then he’ll call me. Who else? El classico. The lord works in mysterious ways. Let’s try again, we say -Hello. -Could I have a tequila? Taking courage from a slight smile Shaking pink snow Off the cherry trees We beg for forgiveness -Another one. -Coming right up. Then we cheat again Aren’t you going a little fast? Now you’re here, now you’re gone So many fairy tales, always pretending No, it was you You took what was ours And left it in other houses -Defne? -Yes? -What’s wrong? -Nothing. Hang out here. Your ex is waiting inside. Would you calm down? Wait for me. I’ll be right back. Defne. Defne! -Defne. -Let me go! -Let me go! -Every time something happens are you going to leave without understanding or listening? You’d broken up with Aylin before. Then you went back. She’s still waiting for you. -Don’t touch me! -What is this all about? She was telling all about it in the restroom. That’s what this is about. You can’t handle relationships. You get bored. You always go back to her. She’s "do not answer", isn’t she? Who cares what Aylin says? Listen to me. It’s over with her. Why don’t you believe me? You’re all the same. You’re all the same. I thought you were different. You know? Wait a second. What are you doing? This isn’t like you. Do you want to break up? If you do, tell me. Okay? Don’t make a scene over every little thing. You seem so ready to break up. What do you want to know? What is it, really? Okay, since you’re not lying call "do not answer". Call in front of me. I want to hear it. Go on. Screw you and Aylin and "do not answer"! If you won’t trust me, there’s nothing I can do. We’re wearing each other out. -Let’s have a pause. -A pause? A break… …to calm down. I understand perfectly. There’s no such thing as a break. You know that. We’re together, or we’re not. -Defne. -I’ll get my things later. Taking courage from a slight smile Shaking pink snow Off the cherry trees We beg for forgiveness Then we cheat again -Good day. -Good day. Mom anything for me? No, dear. Greeks deported in recent months are banned from entering Turkey. Master Ali? Take these. Any news? Unfortunately not. Auntie Eleni, any news? No dear. None. None. Defne, I made some toast. At least have a bite. I told you I didn’t feel like it. Fine. Faint in class. The kids will love it. Where’s this heading? How do I know, Senem. I don’t know, either. My mom’s coming and she was eager to meet Kerem. What should I tell her? That we split up? Have you split up? Are you sure? What has happened, then? He hasn’t even called. I’m sure he’s with that girl. Why are doing this to yourself? He didn’t say he wanted to separate. He said, pause and think things over. It was you who left. Why should he be the one to call? Listen, you felt something for the first time in ages. Your eyes were sparkling. Don’t throw it all away over some nonsense. There’s no good reason for it. No good reason? He lied to me. What more? He was hiding things. He’d grown distant and changed. I just can’t. As he wishes. Sweetie you’re projecting the trauma from Gokhan onto Kerem. Put yourself in his place. He loves you. And he shows it. But you walk out at every opportunity. How can he trust you? I don’t want to be deceived again. Tell me. Do you love him? I don’t want to love him. He’ll hurt me. I know it. Fine, then. If you’re so sure don’t call him, okay? Stand by your words and don’t call. I won't! And no texts. Never. Are you eating or not? Not. Good for you. Continue. You’re the most annoying person in the world right now. Hush. UNFRIEND Enough with the long face. Please cheer up a little. I came at your insistence but stop pestering me, alright? Let me sit in peace. Surprise! Welcome. -Welcome, Murat. -Nice to be here. -Welcome, Murat. -Congratulations, Murat. Congratulations, Murat. Best of luck, Murat. What a nice reception. Thank you so much. Welcome. Mom. Welcome, Son. -Dad. -Welcome. My sister. What a nice surprise. This is how a surprise should be. Congratulations. Thank you. -Welcome. -Thank you. Please have a seat. -How are you? -Fine, thank you. And you? I’m well. Better after seeing you. Stop being so formal, would you? And there’s not much of an age difference between us. Shall we dance? If you don’t mind, I don’t feel well. I understand. But don’t disappoint me today. I’m coming home after so long. I’ll have more flights soon. Who knows when I’ll see you again. Don’t refuse my big brother. Please. You’ve changed so much in two years. I wouldn’t have recognized you. But I wouldn’t have been able to take my eyes off you, either. You’re exaggerating. It’s the truth. I’m sorry. I can’t. Sema? How was the tea party? Sema? My girl. Mother, I know what you’re doing and I’m not interested! Don’t say that, dear. Your father and I are only thinking of your future. Murat is a well-meaning, bright young man. And his intentions are sincere. Mother, I love Niko. Niko’s gone. He’s not coming back. Yes, he is. Niko wouldn’t leave me. Nuran, now tell your daughter. Niko got married. What? You heard me. Niko got married in Athens. No. I don’t believe it, Mother. Believe it or not! Drop this subject already. -Understood? -No, I won’t. Niko wouldn’t do that to me. Niko did what was best. Anyway, has he ever written? No. He has to think of his future and you do, too. Stop mourning. Pull yourself together. Murat’s family will ask for your hand soon. Mother? Mother. He didn’t. Mother. Mother. He didn’t, Mother. I know he wouldn’t. He wouldn’t. He did! -He did this to me. -Don’t. Let me go! Mother. My girl. It hurts, right here. Like the flow of thirsty waters Like the look in desperate eyes Like a sudden knock on the door Like a scorpion burning in a flame Giving up on afar next to you I asked myself the unanswerable Lost and drifting through storms I found my own uncharted island Without realizing it Without realizing it Without realizing it I’ve become yours -WHEN SHALL I GET MY THINGS? -WHENEVER YOU WANT OK, I'LL STOP BY TOMORROW GOOD NIGHT DEFNE, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS Without realizing it I’ve become yours SANA DA Without realizing it I’ve become yours Hello. -Welcome. -Thank you. What would you like? Custard, rice pudding? Nothing, thank you. I’m not staying long. My family insisted I come. I heard you plan to propose. Yes. If you like. First of all, I apologize for not responding to you for so many months. But there’s something you should know. Considering how heartbroken I am marriage would be unfair to you, too. Sema, as time passes, the past is forgotten. Wounds heal. It’s the future that matters. You’re still very young. We’re both young. If we’re understanding we’ll grow to love each other. And there’s no rush. When you’re ready we’ll get engaged. I have a surprise. Ayla says you never go out, you are like a bird in a cage. Perhaps this bird would like to fly. Sema you’re well-educated. It might help you to work and travel. If you wish. HIRING STEWARDESSES Dear passengers in a few moments we will be landing in Athens. Please fasten your seatbelts, put your seats upright and extinguish your cigarettes. ATHENS 1968 Don’t throw us out. We haven’t done anything. Doctor, he’s had a fever for three days. What should we do? Shall we take him to the hospital? Mrs. Marika, Mr.Yorgo’s in critical condition. What I mean is, you need to call a priest. What are you saying? I’m terribly sorry. Mother? Let me show you out. Get up. Let’s open the shop. I got new fabric. I hope they don’t burn them. I’m coming. Hello. Niko Kazanidis? Yes. Yes? Hello, Nikos Kazanidis, Istanbul? No. "Dear Niko, Sema got engaged." "Please stop writing." "Think of your future." "I wish you happiness at the soonest." "Sema’s mother, Nuran." Hello. Hello. I don’t think I can get everything today. I’ll get the rest later, okay? -Okay. -Thanks. How are you? Fine. How are you? Not bad. I’m not bad, either actually. I miss you so much. I miss you, too. You won’t leave me, will you? -Hello? -Hello, Defne. Tell the guys downstairs to stop looking for my phone. Lay these out. -Good morning, darling. -Good morning, darling. I’m sending someone to fetch my phone. I’m about to leave. I have a lot to do. I can bring it this evening. Okay. Bring it then. Okay. Kisses. Kisses. DO NOT ANSWER Hello, Kerem? Kerem’s not here. He forgot his phone at home. May I ask who’s calling? I’m his father. -His father? -Yes. Who am I speaking to? Defne. Kerem’s girlfriend. Really? Nice to meet you. I’ve been unable to get through to Kerem. Could you tell him I called? I’m coming to Ankara. I want to see him. Kerem’s at the restaurant. I can give you his number. Can you write it down? Thank you, my girl. If suffering is freedom We are both free She is a nestless sparrow I am a caged canary She flitted from branch to branch Scattering her heart I carved up my heart In lines of defiance But to love is to seek But to love is to miss To find only to lose again A fanciful plaything Lies, all lies Lies, all lies There’s something called love There’s nothing called love I suffered for days Suffered in silence In this ephemeral life In the chaos of an earthquake I lived a thousand years Clinging to suffering If suffering is freedom We are both free Left over from the pain Only glances remain The mist in your eyes Was the clouds at sunset She came and asked me, too. I did what you said, Mrs. Nuran. I told her Niko got married. It’s on our head. Thank you, Master Ali. We had to, for Sema’s sake. Right… I can’t keep these at home anymore. I can’t throw them away, either. Kemal would be furious if he knew I still had them. Ali, take these letters. Keep them or throw them out. Forgive me. I do. Good day. Is Master Ali around? He passed away. I’m his son. How can I help you? My condolences, Tahsin. It’s me, Niko. Niko? -Welcome. -Thanks. My brother! -Welcome. Have a seat. -Nice to be here. -Let me get you a tea. -Thanks. -Freshly brewed. -Thanks. The long-lost Niko, my friend. We all cried after you left. I cried my share, too, Tahsin. It’s so nice to see you here. What brings you? They’re returning our houses. I came to get the deed. The neighborhood’s changed so much. I barely recognized it. So much has changed. Any news of Sema? I heard she got married. She did. To a pilot. We heard she became a flight attendant. She moved away after a few years. Then her husband died and she came back. Niko… I was entrusted something. Entrusted? Wait, I’ll bring it. I found these in my father’s safe and didn’t know what to do. They’d asked him to keep them and, of course, he did. As you can see, your letters never reached Sema. What a great love. It was, Tahsin. What did you do? Did you get married? I did, Tahsin. Years later. ATHENS 1977 …so everything is okay. Sema, are you okay? Are you okay, Sema. I’m fine. I’m fine, thanks. My neighbor asked me to bring someone some baklava from Istanbul. They’re waiting outside. Can you do it for me? -Of course I can. -Thank you. Niko and Leyla became acquainted while working at the embassy. They grew fond of one another. What remains to us is to smooth their path. With God’s command and the consent of the prophet we ask for your daughter Leyla’s hand in marriage to our son Niko. ATHENS 1979 "Beloved Sema…" "Mother asked how we could fit an entire life in a suitcase." "I don’t care about possessions." "I can’t fit my love for you into the distance between us." "But I have heard that those trying to return are turned back at the border." "As though we’re not from there." "As though we never existed." "In Istanbul, they called us 'Greek spawn' and here they call us 'Turkospori'. Turkish spawn." "Every time I leave home looking for a job I cling to the hope I’ll see you out in the street." "A childish fancy." "But it keeps me going." "We can speak Greek all we want now." "But I always speak Turkish." "So I won’t forget if I ever return." "So I can talk to you again." "So I can write you letters." "Istanbul is far away but memories of you are so near." "When I look at the sky, I see you." "When you smile, the skies smile." "We’ll meet again one day, I promise." "Your beloved Niko." Dear passengers, ensure all baggage is secured in the overhead compartments or under the seat in front of you. Fasten your seatbelts, please. Ensure your seat back is straight and your tray table is stowed. Open your window blinds and stow your footrest. Mom. -Dearest. -Welcome. Thank you, dear. Let me get a look at you. Have you lost weight? No, I’m the same. Really. Dear. Come on. Are you well? I should ask you that. You’re all alone there. I worry about you. I’m fine, dear. I’m in my neighborhood. Why don’t you move in with me? What keeps you in Istanbul? Memories. I grew up there. Don’t worry. I feel just fine. Dear. So are we going to meet your Kerem? We are. He’s expecting us. Nice place. Welcome. Thank you. Hello. Kerem. Sema. -Pleased to meet you. -Likewise. Are you closed tonight? I wanted it to be just us. You’re so thoughtful. Thank you. It’s raining hard. You arrived just in time. You brought my phone, right? Yes. Kerem, your father called. He left a note saying he’s on his way. I see. Thank you. Defne, could you come to the kitchen for a moment? Please excuse us. -I’ll be right back. -Okay. Could you all leave? Stay away for a couple minutes. Leave that. What gives you the right to answer my phone? You lied to me, Kerem. No looking at my phone and no interfering in my life, Defne. You said he was dead. To me, my father’s dead. That’s why I said that! You gave him the number to this place. Who do you think you are? He asked for you. What was I supposed to do? Why can’t we talk things over? -Aren’t I your girlfriend? -Being my girlfriend doesn’t give you the right to answer my phone and interfere in my life. I’m not interfering. I’m just trying to understand. You don’t tell me anything. I thought it was Aylin. Boy! Aylin! But it wasn’t her. Are you happy now? Now I don’t trust you. Kerem. Don’t. Leave, Defne. What? Leave. Look me in the eye. Look me in the eye, I said. I’m not going anywhere. Okay? We’re going to talk it all over. What’s going on with your father? Why are you so angry at him? Why is a part of you so sad? Tell me everything. I’m your girlfriend. I love you. Understand that. If we can’t talk about these things, what’s the point? You’re right. There’s no point. Not like this. You’re overstepped, Defne. I don’t want to hurt you anymore. So I’m asking you to go. Tell your mother something came up. Make up an excuse. Kerem. Don’t. Kerem. -Let’s go, Mom. -But why? I’ll explain later. Come on. What happened? Are you okay? Kerem. We’re closed. Son. Please. Please. I kept calling. I know. I didn’t answer. Did it occur to you that I didn’t want to talk? Why did you come here? Especially after all this time? You’re right. You’re right to be angry and upset. You didn’t visit even once. After we returned to Turkey you didn’t come once. Did you know Mom was crying out your name? As she died. Now who cares if you come, or go, are dead, or alive. I couldn’t come, Son. There are things you don’t know. And I don’t want to know! I don’t even know you! And you don’t know me! It’s better that way! Let me tell you something else. Because of you, I’m unable to love, too. Because you never loved us. Not me… …and not Mom. No… I loved you more than anything. Forgive me, Son. Take care of yourself. Have you nothing to say, Niko? We’re leaving. ATHENS 1987 Look at me, just once. You haven’t looked at me in ten years. You never loved me, did you? You never forgot her. Leyla, I’m sorry. I never lied to you. You knew when you married me. I always respected you. I gave you the best life I could. Of course you deserved better but it was I all I could do. If you’ll be happier in Turkey I won’t stand in your way. You can send Kerem in the summer. Come too, if you like. If you ask for a divorce that’s your choice. Shame on you. After ten years shame on you. I’m not sending Kerem. You hear me? You’ll never see your son again. -Leyla. -Leave me alone! Kerem… I love you, Son. Go outside. What do you know about love? It hurts right here. You know? It hurts a lot. Of course I know. You can’t breathe. Do you know when the pain stops? -Do you know? -When? When you surrender. When you love him, flaws and all. When you dare to call him, no matter what. When, whether you’re together or not you learn to be grateful that he exists. When you are able to go on loving him the pain disappears. And you say to yourself how lucky I am to know true love. Then nothing else matters. So don’t upset yourself. If you truly love Kerem, what could be more beautiful? What about you, Mother? Who have you loved like this? Someone I met long before your father. I’m so fortunate to love like this. And nobody can take that away from me. You, too, are lucky to love, to be able to love, Kerem this much. Dear. "Kerem, my son, I never had the chance to explain myself." "Perhaps it’s too late. Perhaps it’s just the right time." "I didn’t stay away all those years because it’s what I wanted." "There are things you need to know." "Before you were born, there was a woman I loved." "When I lost her, I lost a piece of myself." "Your mother never forgave me for being unable to forget her." "To punish me, she wouldn’t let me see you." "I could barely breathe, so could I have done you any good?" "I could have." "I made a mistake. Forgive me." "Forgive me for being unable to be with you." "For being unable to show how much I loved you, for being unable to give you a happy home." "The house I was born in is now yours." "Perhaps you’ll do what I couldn’t and make a home there." "With pride, longing and devotion, your loving father, Niko." Dad? Good evening. Are you Niko Kazanidis’ son? Yes. Dad, please don’t die. I was unable to say anything. I’m so sorry, Dad. Forgive me. Defne. Hello, Kerem. I apologize. I’m so sorry. Defne, my father’s in the hospital. You can’t stay here. Come along. -Kerem. -It’s all my fault, Defne. It’s all my fault. It’s not your fault. It was an accident. I chased him out. I chased you away, too. I hurt everyone. I ruin everything. Don’t let my dad die. Niko Kazanidis’ relatives? Who, who? Niko Kazanidis. Us. These were in Mr. Niko’s car. How is he? The doctor is with him. They’re doing a CT scan of his brain. The doctor will update you. We need you to sign here. Mom? Mom, that’s you. "Beloved Sema…" "We lost Father." "As we were leaving Istanbul he counted the passengers and said the city is minus 32 people." "Now the world is minus one more person." "Minus Yorgo." "Death is a strange thing." "We all live as though this world weren’t temporary." "Our fights and worries are futile." "Is it also futile to go on loving you?" "I learned you were engaged." "I wish you happiness." "I cannot be angry or resentful." "I lost everything in Istanbul." "My home, my childhood, my memories, and you." "Now I’ll never go back." "There is nothing there for me but pain." "Then I remember Apollo and Daphne." "Asli and Kerem." "I know that true love is eternal." "True love is not to give up." "For as long as I live, as long as I take breath, I will love you and you alone." Niko Kazanidis’ relatives? The patient is recovering. In stable condition. As of today we’re moving him from intensive care to a room. I’m so happy for you. Niko, I’m not letting you go anywhere. Do you hear me? Niko. Niko. Niko. Niko, it’s me. Sema. Sema? Am I dead? Darling. Kerem. Darling. My son. Dad. Darling. Asli waited with Kerem so his ashes wouldn’t scatter. A spark set fire to her hair. The ashes of the two lovers were united. They stayed together forever. Beautiful. Then if we have a son, we’ll name him Kerem. And if it’s a daughter? Defne. All right. Sema, consider this an engagement present. Niko, if anyone saw it, I couldn’t explain. At least take this. Until our wedding day. When it finds a space as deep as a breath Let time stop While running despite all Then let it run Let my heart follow a rush Let the truth be forgotten Even by the truth I wish to hit the road Without looking back Though eyes wait a lifetime For a shine with joy Searching for everyone but the mirrors Oh those eyes Dewy sometimes, they yearn Though words are as cold as the night GULCIN AND KOSTAS… WHO INSPIRED THE CHARACTERS NIKO AND SEMA… NOW THEY ARE LIVING HAPPILY TOGETHER. You know there are times You can't find yourself Then you suddenly run into yourself By coincidence Now and then on a street Or in a song Life goes by And you just don't realise You know there are times You can't find yourself Then you suddenly run into yourself By coincidence Now and then on a street Or in a song Life goes by And you just don't realise Life goes by And you just don't realise
