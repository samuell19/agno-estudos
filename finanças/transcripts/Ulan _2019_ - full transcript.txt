Maya. Don't play in the rain. You will get sick. Yes, Grandma. Can't be too careful. You might miss school. Your teacher loves to pile on your homework. It's raining. Grandma, why is it raining even when it's sunny? Because a tikbalang couple is getting married. - Tikbalang? - Yes. The heavens are against their love. So, you see, that is why it's raining. But why? What kind of love is it? A kind of love that was never meant to be. Because tikbalangs... have no right to fall in love. Not ever. Hi, Mark. Hi, Mark! Hey, Mark. Hey, Billiekoy! You're so loud! I'm watching something. Sure! I'm heading out, Auntie. Where are you going? You're all dressed up. Just around. Billiekoy! - You're going out? - Yes, Uncle. Okay. Billiekoy, it's so loud! Hey! Back so soon? I thought you were leaving. I'm leaving now, Auntie. - Have you got blueberry cheesecake? - Yes, we do. - What do you need? In this size? - A whole cake, please. A whole cake. Okay, right away ma'am. Thank you, ma'am. Happy birthday. Who is that? Don't be frightened, child. Come closer. What is your name? I'm Maya, sir. What are you doing out here? We are getting married. Promising each other our undying love. My grandmother says you have no right to fall in love. Why would you still get married? Even the skies do not approve of you. Why would the skies keep us from loving and being loved? It can do nothing but let it rain on our wedding day. Remember this, Maya. Nothing can stand in the way of love. Not even the heavens, with all the rain and storms it may bring. I love you until the end. I love you until the end. Go forth and spread the good news of love. - Hello. - Maya. Hello. - How are you? - Just fine. - Oh, no, you're drenched. Come on in. - All right. I'll get that for you. I'm glad you could make it. Of course. It's your birthday. I wouldn't miss it. Besides, we haven't seen each other in so long. I think it's been three years. It does feel like it. - Maya! - Has it been three years? - Babe. - Oh, my God, you're here! Baby, come to Daddy. Hi. Oh, my God. I missed you so much. Good to see you. Did you get caught in traffic? - In the rain? - No. This is Mikey. - Say hi to Auntie. - Say hi to Auntie. Hi. - Say hi to Auntie Maya. - Sleepy? He's 10 months old. Made in the USA. - I thought you broke up in college. - Yeah. I guess that's just how it is. Some things just happen. - Things just happen, like the baby? - Not that. We decided not to tell other people just yet. We told our family and close friends first. When is the wedding? We're married. Darn that rain. It could have gone great, but I was an ugly mess by the time I reached Mark's. So it's the rain's fault. You don't get it. I think I'm cursed. Every time something good happens to me, it rains all of a sudden. I thought Mark was finally going to confess to me. I thought he was going say it has always been me. Girl, people die from false assumptions. And do you know what that Annie said? She said I look stressed. Girl, do I look stressed to you? Just a little bit. I wanted to shove their faces against the table. Even the baby. Am I evil? Yep. Your soul is going to burn in hell. I waited for him for so long. It can't be helped. Don't worry. You're pretty. It's just that... I'm prettier. Idiot. You know what they say. There's plenty of fish in the sea. It's Mark I want. There is no one else. Just don't go breaking your heart over someone who couldn't care less about you. By the way, that's a nice dress, isn't it? It's not cheap. You've ruined it, you've bought it. Hey! Look at you. I was having a moment. Then you go and charge me. - I'm broke. - You think I'm not? What the heck are you smiling at? Stay down there with the cockroaches. - Owen, go buy me two packs of cigarettes. - Yes, Chief. Maya, aren't you finished with that? How many have you done? Just two more, sir, and I'm off to the printers. Why don't you get back to that later and bring what you've finished to the printers so we can get a move on? It's all the same stories. Nothing new. Here, read this. A plumber meets an old maid. It's a horny piece, but the writer sounds like they're not getting any. What happened to your eyes? Looks like a bug bit it. Nothing, sir. You had a fight with your boyfriend, right? Who am I going to fight with? I don't have a boyfriend. You don't look like you have one. I'm just messing with you. You should grow some breasts. Even the gays have them. Let's go! An eight-year old boy fell into a drainage hole under construction... Can you believe what's happening to our country? - Oh, my God. - This is the Philippines. - Look at that. - ...when he fell in a two-foot hole. Concerned citizens rushed to the scene in attempt to save the child. - You're back. - Yes, Uncle. - Have you eaten? We left you some adobo. - Thank you, Auntie. ...to put a warning sign... Maya, it's the rainy season. You shouldn't be working too far from home. You're getting holed up in that publishing house. You can look for a different job. You can speak fluent English. Apply in a call centre. Besides, you'll find a new boyfriend there for sure. The residents call for action from the government... Okay, Uncle. I'll look for a new job tomorrow. - A new boyfriend too. - Okay, good. I'll go change. ...in different regions of the country. It is estimated... - What? - You idiot. They're just concerned about you. Come to my client's wedding, if you want. Look for a new boyfriend there. Wedding? I'm allergic to weddings, remember? - Don't be picky. - I'm not picky. I just don't want to. You don't want to? You who loves being in love. I don't even think you're interested in men, just in the whole idea of love. Even when it's unrequited, you dive right in. You think so? Get with me then. Yuck. You're a big talker for someone who looks for a boyfriend at the gym. You will die unhappy. Excuse me, of course not. You're the one who's going to die unhappy. Sad as you are, you make no effort to lighten things up. Come with me to the wedding. I'll make you a posse since you look the part. Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown. You're just having the jitters. You think so? Just the jitters? Isn't it like a bad omen or something? My poor baby's getting all worked up again. Dear girl, everything's gonna be fine. Don't worry, okay? He wants to meet you. - He wants to see you... - Yes, sis. Just smile like I do. - Yeah, that's true. - So dramatic. He is the man of my dreams. You're right, Topi. It's just the jitters. Hello? Gabriela suite? Okay, man. I'm looking for it now. What a crybaby. Her groom must be beastly with all her whimpering. Miss. Do you know where Gabriele suite is? Thanks. Are you going to check on the bride? I was hoping to. Oh, you know, it's a mess. Don't go in there. The bride is crying. What? Why? Looks like the wedding's not happening after all. How did that happen? I heard the bride say she doesn't want to see the groom anymore. Forever. Bullcrap. Hey! Hey, wait. Wait. I'll peek in. They're all girls in there. Let me. It's going to be okay, sweetie. It's gonna be okay. Happy now? Hello, bro? Miss! Miss, wait! Miss! You haven't apologised for that little prank of yours. But I forgive you. - I never said I was sorry. - But you should be. Okay, fine. Sorry. The groom's my best friend. Are you one of his girlfriends that I don't know about? Silly, I'm not his ex-girlfriend. - You're a friend of the bride's? - Wrong. I'm just tagging along with my friend because he made the bride's gown. So why did you do it? Because everyone's getting married. Everywhere I look, there's a wedding gown. Whoever hurt you, princess? Why do you ask so many questions? Go back to your best friend. Let him be. He's happy now. Well, you're the only girl I've met who's not into weddings. Why? - Don't you wanna get married someday? - I don't. I don't want to hear it. You're just saying that. Are we close? I don't even know you, but in that case, I wanna get to know you better. I'm Andrew, by the way. You're cocky. What's your next move? This is how a princess falls in love with a prince. Pretty impressive. How many girls have fallen for that? Let's just say that I'm still searching for my ideal woman. You want to apply? I don't want another broken heart. Who said anything about breaking hearts? All I'm saying is... let's give this a chance. Let's see where this goes... where it will take us. This is where it ends. You know, you can tell a lot about a woman judging by the shoes that she wears. This already happened to Cinderella. You're not the first one. Who cares? As long as I get the woman. Ever since I was a kid, I loved building sandcastles. And whenever I would play with Lego blocks, I would build buildings. I always wanted to be an architect. It's always been my dream. So when it comes to my designs, I always like being grand. I can see that. Look at the size of this place. So... to us. You're actually thinking it over. It's the first time someone's making me feel extra special. It's a great feeling. Girl, it's the first time someone tried at all. Period. Just let it happen. Go on, wear this beautiful gown. It's beautiful. The veil. Beautiful. We're missing something. Your bouquet. Go on, walk down the aisle. Beth, music, please. - Have you decided on a cake? - Oh, right. - You're resigning? - Yes, sir. All right. Fine. I can't stop you if you don't like it here anymore. It's just a bit sudden. You did not submit a notice. That is against the law. Well, sir, I hadn't signed a contract. I don't have benefits, and the pay's awfully small. You're complaining now that you're resigning. Okay, whatever. It's your life. But anytime you want to come back, just say so. It's hard to find someone as dedicated as you are. Oh, sir. I had to resign to hear you compliment my work. - What's your plan? - I don't have one. Would you look at that. Got yourself bumchum, huh? No, sir. A boyfriend. A sweetheart. There we go. So that's why your cheeks are flushed. - Who knew someone would look your way? - Bye, sir. - Grandma. Grandma. - Behave yourself. Grandma, I want to ask you something. What is it? How do you know when a man and a woman are meant for each other? What kind of question is that? Where did you pick that up from? You're too young for those things. But, Grandma, say for example, you and Grandpa. What was that moment that made you feel he's the one? Your grandpa kissed me in the rain. Careful. Andrew, let's stay here for a little while. - Why? - Just because. It looks like it's going to rain, isn't it? Andrew? Andrew. Princess. God, I'm so late. So traffic. What are you still doing out here? Actually, we just got here. Oh, I'm so sorry. Maya, this is Princess. Princess, Maya. - Hello. - Hi. - Let's go? - Yeah. Andrew. Maya, let's go. I hope you really do love me. Maya, aren't you going to eat the leftover adobo? I'm coming down. Grandma, will offering eggs really stop the rain from falling? Don't you see me offer eggs on laundry day? And it never rains when I do. But, Grandma, nothing can stop the rain, right? Rain is punishment from the heavens. If you're going to do everything to not get punished, it won't rain. Do you understand? Hi, good morning, Mr. Santos. Yes, this is Maya of TalkToUs Global. How can I help you? Oh, yes, sir. I understand, sir. Sorry to hear that, sir. Yes, sir. Hello. I'm in the middle of training. Yes, you can try to reset your router first. Call centre training. I told you I was going to apply, didn't I? Yes, sir. You told me you weren't pushing through with that. Didn't you say I should listen to Uncle? Besides, I need better pay. And Andrew's all for it. Andrew this, Andrew that. You just started dating, and you're a completely different person. I don't recognise you anymore. Whatever. Bye. You're so dramatic. You're dramatic. Water from our oceans, rivers, and even from our laundered clothes are carried up into the air. This process is called evaporation. The accumulated water droplets form clouds. The accumulated water droplets form clouds. This process is called condensation. Once the clouds grow heavy, it pours back down as rain. This process is called precipitation. Yes, Maya. Madam, how do eggs stop rain from falling? Eggs? Yes, ma'am. My grandma said we should offer eggs if we don't want it to rain. That's just an old superstition, Maya. Rain is a natural process. It's a cycle that happens over and over in our planet. Nothing can stop the rain, especially not just eggs. You see, madam, Maya does nothing but think about eggs. When she's staring into space, her thoughts are filled with eggs. Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Time out. Time out. Water break. You're on a roll. Of course. I'm inspired. I'm still high from winning that bid. Really, you won the bid? Congratulations. You had it all under your sleeve this time. Give yourself some credit. No, no, no. Not without you, Princess. You put the spunk to our design. Oh, wait. It's Mr. Gozar. I have to take this call. Hello, sir. Yes, sir. How's it going? Hello, Mr. Gozar. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Everything's set with the HSBI audit. Yes, sir. Once Princess and I arrive in Hong Kong... Yes, Maya? Something on your mind? Okay. Actually, Princess, I do. I have to ask you something. What is it? Do you like my boyfriend? What kind of question is that? A straightforward question. Do you like my boyfriend? Look, Maya. Andrew and I have been friends since we started working in the company. We've been through a lot together. So I don't think you should be jealous about that. Unless... you're insecure. I am not insecure. I'm just making sure you know your place. Look, Maya. I know you know how to fight for your guy. And I know how to back off. But... we are going to Hong Kong in the next two days. Hasn't he told you? Oh, Andrew. Back to his old tricks. If you think about it, out of all his girls... you're the odd one out. But the same desperation. Princess, you ready? Let's go. Let's finish the game. - Game. - Let's go. You're going to Hong Kong? Well, that's where the construction's going to be. Why didn't you tell me? Well, Maya, I was looking for the perfect timing. Let's talk later. Princess, game. Andrew, hold on. Is the game more important to you? Maya! Girl? What happened to your forehead? "I'm sorry, I don't want to talk about this. I can't have you acting all crazy at this point in my life. It's over." What an idiot. Acting like a prince. Turns out he's just like the rest of them. You know... I've come to accept the fact that... Prince Charming types, they always end up with the pretty girl, the nice princesses. Like Princess. Beautiful, flawless. As for me... I'll never be anything but the evil step sister. I get it, girl. Really, I do. What I don't get is... what's with all these onions? What are you going to do with these? I can't seem to cry it out. I might have been holding back the tears so hard trying to maintain my composure. It's all building up in here. I just want to let it all go so that next time, I won't have tears left to cry. I swear, I will never cry again. I will never cry. I don't want to cry anymore. (Let me drown first in loneliness In the most painful goodbye) (You that I dream of Let me...) (Poem I loved you) Reach for it! Reach for it! Hey, it's Maya! Did your Grandma forget to offer eggs today? Look, it's raining! Be quiet, Serafin, if you don't want to turn into an egg again! Two eggs, shaking about. Smells fishy like Maya! Rotten eggs! Hey, you! All you ever see is Maya. Don't pick on her! - Let her go outside. - Let's leave her alone. I said stop picking on her! Why, is she your girlfriend? Why do you care? - You're so arrogant! - You're so arrogant! I'm coming back, sir, on certain conditions. You're going to give me a raise, sign me up for health benefits, and you're going to stop making fun of me. Maya, I'm not asking you to come back. You're the one who's insisting. And I want to be a writer this time. Developed a lusty appetite, have you? You think you've got what it takes to write a romance? Why not, sir? Where did that fire come from? From bad experiences and men like you, sir. Well... Your boyfriend broke up with you, huh? Just the same, I've been replacing your post three times, and they're all useless. Fine, you may come back. But don't expect a substantial raise. Business isn't doing so well. Okay, sir. Thank you. Rosie, wasn't Maya supposed to be the angel of Galilea for Easter Sunday? Oh, geez, maybe next year. We had to give way to the mayor's granddaughter. - Maya! - What a waste. Maya! Maya would have looked so graceful coming down from the heavens. Let's go for a bike ride. - I don't know how to ride a bike. - I'll teach you. - Since it's already summer break. - Jose Albert's got the love bug. Okay. - Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. - Let's go, buddy. Thank you. Maya. Maya, you've been staring into space. How's your story coming along? Make sure it will get me hard. You haven't written a word, have you? Thing is you're all about imagination when you should be about penetration. What about you? - I get plenty, sir. - Plenty. Good. Maya? - Maya Landicho? - Yes. My name is Peter. Joseph Peter Buendia. It was raining. I picked up your umbrella and helped you with your things. - Don't you... - Oh, yeah. I remember now. I wanted to return this. I tried to dry it off, but it looks beat up. I couldn't read your number. And the address written there got smudged... - Did you read this? - No. No, miss. Do you work here? Are you a writer? No. I have an office here, but I'm not a writer. Just an editor's assistant. But you're going to be a writer? I hope so. - Thank you for this, by the way. - No problem. Do you need anything? Don't I get a reward or something? That should be enough. That's a lot, actually. Really. These days, we've got fewer and fewer people with goodwill. That's all you're getting. Are you familiar with "pay it forward"? You give back the good that was done to you. But I thought you wanted a reward. I'm a volunteer at an NGO that campaigns for the literacy of street children. We need writers, you see, for the pamphlets and... Hold on a second. Is this a scam? Networking? No. If you want, find me at the public library. In Manila. That will be more than fine. Hey, someone's interested in her. Looks like Maya is gonna get some love. Miss. Excuse me. I'm looking for Joseph Peter Buendia. - Joseph Peter Buendia? He's upstairs. - Thank you. - Ma'am, please log your name. - Oh, thank you. He is not itching anymore. Prince Chikiting now takes regular baths. So, what are you going to do first thing when you get home? - Take a bath! - Take a bath. Very good. You were able to draw my tikbalangs. So you did read it. Forgive me. I couldn't help myself. Your stories were so engaging. But don't worry. I couldn't read the rest of it. The rain erased most of it. That doesn't change anything. It's still invasion of privacy. That's why I'm asking for forgiveness. All right, think of it this way. Pretend I'm a priest and those were your confessions. You're the priest but you're the one asking for forgiveness? - Oh, right. - Well, never mind. Forget about it. I forgive you. Besides, you look like a good person. I really am a good person. Your story about the tikbalang, you stopped writing about it. What happened after they got married? Who knows? That's all there was to it. You just said sorry. Besides, we're not friends yet. My God, it's so hot. Geez. But when it rains, the flooding is endless. Thank you. Did you see that drainage by the road they're ignoring in the summer? Once it starts raining, that's when they rush to work on it. That's when they get their panties in a twist trying to get it done in time. This government. - Here. - Thank you. (June stares at April's angelic face down to her big breast...) - Hi. - Stop it. That's enough. That's fine. - What do you really do here? - Everything. I can take pictures, draw pictures, do the layouts. I can be the teacher, organiser, fundraiser, cook. Sometimes I'm a policeman too. Or a firefighter. - Depends on what the kids want. - I meant your real job. You said you're just a volunteer here. Hey. Maya, being a volunteer isn't a trifle. Some of them cannot read. Some don't know how to count. Experienced the real world too early. Had to grow up too fast. But you know, these are small efforts compared to the expanse of the problem. What can I do to start volunteering? - Teacher Luis. - Yes? - This is Miss Maya. - Hi, Maya. Kids, introduce yourselves to Miss Maya. - Hello. - Hello. Okay, go, go. There you go. You can do it. It fell. If it falls again... - Hey. Cut it out. - Why? That's enough. What are you doing? Can I join in? - Join us. Game. - Okay. My parents' memories in my mind, I can't remember their faces, but if I catch a whiff of my mum's perfume or something that smells like it, I remember her vividly. - The feel of her comes back. - Yeah. Something like that. - Is that weird? Not weird at all, right? - No, it's not. Want me to swing it harder? Why do you seem to write about the lonely stuff? Maybe because I'm just lonely person. And I feel like only the notebook can understand me completely when it comes to those things. I do have a friend, Topi. But sometimes I think he thinks I'm too intense, you know. So you want to keep this chill vibe around him. You don't want to share sad things, things that might spoil the mood - because he might say... - You just pour all that energy - into the notebook. - Yes. But who's the "wish"? The "wish"... It's not a person. Perhaps it's more of a feeling, this longing to be showered with attention and love. Because I lost my parents. I lost my Grandma too. I used to get all that love from them, and now it's all gone. When you get used to something like that, you keep wanting it back. Or at least, you want to be able to shower somebody else with the same love and attention. I think that's what I'm missing. - I have something like that. - What do you wish for? I wish the world gets filled with love. Infinite, overflowing. And I wish that... that love is untarnished by doubt. A most certain kind of love that is absolute. - Wouldn't that be nice? - Yes. You're it! I'm it! Who's it? Oh, no! Maya! Come on! Let's go for a bike ride! Where are you going? Are all my grey hairs gone? Yes, Grandma. I was going to water the plants. Liar. I have a third eye, don't you know? You're just going to play with Jose Albert. Then you'll come home dirty. Suit yourself! Here. Look here. My grandma said the ship they were on was swept away by a huge wave. Then I was in her care. When my grandma was gone, I lived with my aunt and uncle. I suppose that's why they want you to settle down, right? Why? That was in the notebook, wasn't it? So you know everything about me now. We're close friends now, huh? We're friends now? You'd get so annoyed every time they'd tell you to get a boyfriend. That will never happen. Why do you say that? Because I'm done with love, remember? I've sworn out of it. We're kind of alike in that. How do you mean? Like what my editor-in-chief always says, lacking in sensuality. - Let's see about that. - Hey. You're insane. What time is it? I should be going. I'll take care of the cupcakes, I promise. - All right. Thank you. - Okay. - The kids will appreciate it. - All right. Bye. Take care. Bye. Take care. Sorry. Wow, what is that? Is that our new bestseller? You're furiously at it. Are you writing from experience? I'm not writing a romance novel. This is a children's story. Oh, no, she's gone crazy. - What did you just say? - This has a market too, sir. But our market is sex, so stop that. Sir, this is what I want to write. This is what my heart wants. Don't do it on my watch. To hell with that! What do you plan to do with my friend? After we deliver the cupcakes, nothing yet. I meant your plan. As in for the future. We've only just met, but I'm telling you. Maya cannot be hurt again. Ever. Like, ever. So? Come on. Come with me. Maya! You are soaking wet! Why are you out in the rain? Come to me! You should have waited in the classroom. Come on now. Be careful. (Language Week, August 28, 2002) Auntie, he's my friend Peter. - Peter. - Good day. Good day too. We visited Grandma's grave. It's her death anniversary. We visited Mum and Dad's too. - It's so nice that you dropped by. - Yes, Auntie. I'm sure you're starving from that long trip. - It's fine. - Would you like something to drink? Have you eaten? - Okay, Auntie. - Okay, good. I have some snacks and bread. Just wait here. Okay, Auntie. Thank you. Maya. Here's your favourite. Careful. It's hot. Give it to me. I'll pour some for you. You might burn yourself. It's delicious, Grandma. Get as much as you like. I cooked that for you. You look pretty in that one. My grandma would insist that I be crowned Reyna Elena or the Rosa Mystica so I could be holding flowers for once. But I always end up with the severed head. Reyna Judith. Still a reyna. Did you know... they say all dust are teensy tiny shooting stars? Space dust. Broken up asteroids, tree bark, human grime. We all came from a giant star that exploded in the beginning of time. This is where I saw the tikbalangs. They were getting married. Maya, look what happened to you. You're so stubborn. I told you not to go out in the rain. Turn sideways. Okay, there. Maya... I'm a seminarian. Under regency. Regency is the time given to us... to experience life outside the seminary. I was six months into my regency by the time I met you. Maya, forgive me for not letting you know about this earlier. How can you be a priest if you're a liar? I don't know what to do. I think I need to discover what's really in my heart first. Because I've fallen for you. And there's no containing it. But it's not enough. How can I possibly compete with God? You once told me... that we all came from one star. That nothing is an accident. There must be a reason why you came along. Can't we wait a little longer to see what it could mean? There is no reason. It means nothing. And like you, I also made a promise to myself. I promised myself I would never shed another tear. And now, our Little Mister and Miss Paudpod who garnered 123,506 pesos. What great help this is to our school. None other than Jose Albert Garcia and Angelica Kaye Madela. May I call on our Honourable Mayor Bong Madela to crown our winners? Okay. Once more, let's give them a round of applause. Oh, Maya. Have you had dinner? We're having adobo. - I'm okay. - Come, let's eat. They've got a name for the typhoon. Aning. They say it's a strong one. If I were you, I'd start bringing up the refrigerator and the piano upstairs. Because if anything happens to my furniture, you'll be sorry. For Christ's sake. I'll get you a plate. - This looks good, Uncle. - It's on its third reheating. There you go. Rice? Hey. What are you doing out here? Staring into nothing as usual. Don't you ever get jealous of your brides? Do you ever think about getting married someday? You think Norman will ask you to marry him in the future? I hope he does. It depends. It's up to him. But right now, I don't feel like we're lacking something. Nothing is lacking. With you. With us. They keep saying that whenever you enter a relationship, you should save some for yourself. But I realise... I don't have to save anything for myself. Because I know I will never run out. You love Peter. - Oh, Maya. - Sir. It's a Saturday. You know me, dedicated to my work. That's why you keep me around. What about you, sir? What are you doing here? Yeah, well, it's noisy at home. It gets on my nerves. My wife won't stop yapping. Sir, have you read my story? - The children's story? - Yes. Didn't I tell you, "To hell with that"? I'll tell it to you, sir. Come with me. Let's go on a date. Gosh, I didn't know you had a secret crush on me. - Come on then. - Leave it to me, sir. In the middle of the garden is a verdurous tree. Aya could make out the form of three creatures under it. Aya was staggered by what she saw. Miss, what is "staggered"? "Staggered" means "surprised." Surprised by what? Surprised by the tikbalangs. A modest wedding is being held. However, these are not people. Instead, strange creatures are celebrating. Come to us if you need anything. Thank you. Thank you. Luis. Luis, has Peter dropped by today? I'm not sure. You want me to call him? No, I'll do it. Thank you. Blankets? Blankets? - Doc, excuse me. - Okay. Hello? Maya, how are you? I'm okay. I'm at the library helping Luis with the evacuees. Looks like it's a strong typhoon. Where are you? I'm here in Rizal delivering medical supplies. But I'm almost on my way back. I'm happy that you called. Me too. I'm happy to hear your voice. I'm so delighted. Are you smiling? Yes. Maya, can we meet? Please. I need to talk to you. Okay, yes. Just text me when. Take care. You too. Take care. Text me when you get home. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Maya. Don't be frightened. Come closer. Who are you? Where did you come from? Don't you recognise me? What with the whole nation tattling about me even before I've arrived. The wretched villains. Maya, don't even try to get home. Our roads are flooded. No one can pass through. Okay... Susan? Okay, okay then. Bye. Susan, you're the one panicking. Help me over here. - Wait! - There's the flood! - Here it comes! - Here comes the flood! Help me! Carry it up! Are you the storm? Are you Aning? Why are you crying? What woman has not cried over a love lost? How cruel. How agonising. How heartbreaking. Hello? Maya. My God. Where are you? Have you seen the news? All areas are flooded. My God. Tell Maya to stay wherever she is. Maya, the Marikina River's overflowing. The dam in Rizal has released water. All right then. Watch yourself. All right. Goodbye. Take care. - I'll be right back. - Okay, sure. Hello, Peter? Hello? Hello, Maya? Are you still at the library? Yes. Yes, I'm still here. I'll just be here. - Where are you now? - I'm driving. I'm about to cross a river. I can barely see anything. Why don't you pull over and wait it out? It's fine. I'm buddies with the Lord. Hey, don't talk like that. Please be careful. Maya, hold on. I can't wait till later to tell you something. Tell me what? Maya, I'm leaving the seminary. I won't be going into priesthood. You're the one I want. I'll do whatever it takes. I will wait for as long as it takes for you to love again. Maya? Maya. Maya, hello? - Hello? - Yes, okay. Okay. We'll talk. Let's meet. I promise. Just be careful. I will. Peter? Peter? Peter? Hello? Hello? Who broke your heart? He was the love of my life. He who has sworn to love me with all honesty. But he is a hypocrite. What else can I do but give him a taste of his own cruelty? The scoundrel! And he dares mock me amidst my shame. Suffer how you shattered my heart! Philippines! How are you, Maya? I believed you. You told me nothing could ever stand in the way of love. Not even the heavens. No matter how many storms it would bring. I believed you. But you failed me. Peter loves me. And I love him. Are we being punished? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry, Maya. I'm sorry. One day, you will get hurt, Maya. Because the death of true love... is the greatest pain of all. Grandma, didn't you tell me that Mum and Dad are part of the universe now? Yes. Like the dust at home, they're never really gone. So don't be sad, Grandma. I'm sorry, young lady. You take care. A spell-binding sky Rain falling upon my shoulders Under a festival of leaves I took shelter Hundreds of memories Play before my eyes Shadows of a past come dancing In the breeze I'll just laugh it off Why would I weep? My affections Trifled with by madness and... The rain Who doesn't feel like dancing In the rain? Who isn't driven mad by the rain? Lifted up to the skies From whence it came Thousands of memories Swept in by rain showers Hundreds of memories Play before my eyes Shadows of a past come dancing In the breeze I'll just laugh it off Why not? My affections trifled with by madness And the rain Who doesn't feel like dancing In the rain? Who isn't driven mad by the rain? I'll just laugh it off Why not? My affections trifled with by madness And the rain Who doesn't feel like dancing In the rain? Who doesn't feel like dancing In the rain? Who isn't driven mad By the rain? Who doesn't feel like dancing in the rain?
