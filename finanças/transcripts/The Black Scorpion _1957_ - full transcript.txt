CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS. FOR CENTURIES, THE PRAYERS OF MEXICO'S PEASANTS HAVE BEEN THEIR ONLY SHIELD AGAINST THE DEVASTATING FURIES THAT HAVE WRECKED THEIR HOMES AND DESTROYED THEIR LIVES. AND SO TODAY, AGAIN THEY KNEEL, TERRIFIED AND HELPLESS, AS A NEW VOLCANO IS CREATED BY THE MYSTERIOUS AND REBELLIOUS FORCES OF NATURE. THE EARTH HAS SPLIT A THOUSAND TIMES. WHOLE ACRES OF RICH FARMLANDS HAVE CRACKED AND DROPPED FROM SIGHT, AND MILLIONS OF TONS OF MOLTEN LAVA ARE ROARING DOWN THE SLOPES IN A QUAKE RECORDED ON THE SEISMOGRAPH OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MEXICO AS THE MOST VIOLENT OF MODERN TIMES. TO THE BENIGHTED CITIZENRY OF THIS REMOTE COUNTRYSIDE, THE MOST ALARMING ASPECT OF THE PHENOMENON IS THE FACT THAT ITS UNABATED HOURLY GROWTH IS WITHOUT PRECEDENCE, HAVING REACHED A TOWERING HEIGHT OF 9,000 FEET WITHIN A FEW DAYS, AND WITH EACH ADDED FOOT, IT SPREADS ITS EVIL ONSLAUGHT INTO A WIDER CIRCUMFERENCE. BUT WHAT IS NOW MOST FEARED IS THAT RESCUE WORK WILL BE SEVERELY HAMPERED BY THE HAZARDOUS INACCESSIBILITY OF THE TERRAIN. WELL, THERE SHE IS. YEAH. HOW MUCH FURTHER DO YOU SUPPOSE, DOC? THREE DAYS ON THIS WASHBOARD, AND THAT VOLCANO LOOKS AS FARAWAY AS IT EVER DID. NOBODY STUCK A GUN IN YOUR BACK TO MAKE YOU BECOME A GEOLOGIST. YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUB IT IN. "SAN LORENZO, 12 KILOMETERS." YOU KNOW, IF THERE WAS ANY OTHER VILLAGE WITHIN 50 MILES OF HERE, A SIGN LIKE THIS COULD CONFUSE PEOPLE. LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE HAS BEEN THROUGH HERE LATELY. YEAH. ARMY TRUCK, MAYBE. POLICE. DON'T GET ME WRONG, DOC. I LOVE THIS MEXICO OF YOURS, BUT UP AROUND HERE, I THINK I COULD STAND A LITTLE COMPANY. FOR MY INFORMATION, HANK, HOW DID YOU GET PERMISSION SO FAST, FROM MY GROUP, I MEAN? AFTER ALL, RED TAPE AND THAT SORT OF THING. SIMPLE. JUST TOLD THEM THE TRUTH... THAT YOU NEEDED ME ALONG AS AN INTERPRETER. HA HA! THAT MAY BE TRUE, BUT I THINK THE LANGUAGE YOU REALLY SPOKE BEST WAS WITH OUR SECRETARY WHO SECURED ALL THE DOCUMENTS FOR YOU. OH, I DIDN'T USE SPANISH WITH HER. THAT WAS SIGN LANGUAGE. HA HA HA! INCREDIBLE... TRULY, ISN'T IT? IF THESE ESTIMATES ARE RIGHT, THIS QUAKE MAY BE AS SEVERE AS MOUNT PELEE, VESUVIUS, OR SAN FRANCISCO. LUCKY THERE ARE SO FEW PEOPLE UP HERE. WELL, THERE WERE ENOUGH. HELLO. HI. HOW FAR YOU COME, FELLAS? MEXICO CITY. WE LEFT ON MONDAY. WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO? SAN LORENZO. HOW FAR IS IT? DO YOU KNOW? WHO KNOWS HOW THE BRIDGES ARE? MAYBE A COUPLE OF HOURS. A POLICE CAR WENT BY JUST BEFORE SUNDOWN. THEY DIDN'T COME BACK, SO MAYBE THEY GOT THROUGH O.K. WAS SAN LORENZO HURT BADLY? WHO KNOWS? THE TELEPHONE LINES ALL DOWN SINCE THE EARTHQUAKE. THANKS A LOT. SEE YOU LATER. TAKE IT EASY. WHAT THE DEVIL WAS THAT? I DON'T KNOW. ORDINARILY I'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST MOONLIGHT NIGHTS, BUT I'LL BE GLAD TO GET BY THIS ONE. LOOKS LIKE A FARMHOUSE UP AHEAD. MAYBE WE CAN GET SOME WATER UP THERE. I HOPE SO. I'D LIKE TO SAVE THOSE LAST TWO BOTTLES OF BEER. A LITTLE GAS STATION NEVER LOOKED BETTER. HELLO! ANYBODY HOME? I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND A WELL. HEY, HELLO IN THERE! WONDER IF WE CAN HAVE WATER FOR OUR JEEP? HEY, HANK! YEAH? COME HERE! LOOK AT THIS. OVER HERE, TOO. WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE... LOOK AT THAT! WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? MUST BE THAT PATROL CAR THOSE TELEPHONE MEN SAW, BUT I CERTAINLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED OR WHY. WHAT COULD DO THIS TO A CAR OUT HERE? YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THEY'RE TRYING TO WALK TO SAN LORENZO? 511. CALLING 511. DO YOU READ ME? SERGEANT VEGA, DO YOU READ ME? THIS IS HEADQUARTERS CALLING. 511. HELLO. HELLO. DO YOU READ ME? 511. I READ YOU, SERGEANT VEGA. WHAT'S YOUR LOCATION? SERGEANT VEGA? HERE. YOU BETTER TAKE THIS. YOU'RE HEAD MAN DOWN HERE. HELLO. GO AHEAD, PLEASE. THIS IS ARTURO RAMOS, PROFESSOR OF GEOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY. MY ASSOCIATE AND I CAME UPON THIS PATROL CAR. THERE HAS BEEN AN ACCIDENT. I BELIEVE WE'RE A FEW KILOMETERS SOUTH OF THE VILLAGE OF SAN LORENZO. WHERE'S SERGEANT VEGA? HE'S NOT HERE. NO ONE'S HERE. THE CAR IS BADLY DAMAGED, BUT THERE'S NO BLOOD. DID THE CAR RUN OFF THE ROAD? NO. FRANKLY, IT... DIDN'T THE POLICE SERGEANT MAKE A REPORT AFTER THE ACCIDENT? THE RADIO'S WORKING. NO, WE HAVE HEARD NOTHING. THANK YOU, PROFESSOR. LEAVE THE PATROL CAR AS IT IS. WE SHALL ORDER MILITARY INTELLIGENCE TO SEND AN EMERGENCY UNIT TO SAN LORENZO IMMEDIATELY. WE WILL. WELL, WE'RE NOT DOING ANY GOOD HERE, PAL. HANK, SOME OF MY COUNTRYMEN MAY LIKE RATTLESNAKES IN THE HOUSE. I CAN DO WITHOUT THEM. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. THAT RATTLESNAKE IS THE WORST KIND OF THEM ALL. COME ON, FELLA. THERE YOU GO. YOU'VE HAD PRACTICE, MR. SCOTT? I GUESS SO, WITH FOUR BROTHERS AND TWO SISTERS. WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE CAUSED THIS WRECK, THAT POLICE CAR OUT THERE? IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BULL. WELL, IF IT WAS, IT HAD TO BE THE GRANDPAPPY OF THE BIGGEST BULL THAT EVER WAS. HANK, YOU DID NOTICE THE FRIED BEANS WERE STILL HOT ON THE STOVE? YEP. SO? WHEN I'VE ALREADY GOT A HALF-DOZEN QUESTIONS I CAN'T ANSWER, I TRY TO IGNORE ANY NEW ONES. YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO USE THE RADIO TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE KID? NO. I THINK WE WE OUGHT TO GET TO SAN LORENZO AS QUICK AS WE CAN. LOOK AT THIS KID. NOT A PEEP OUT OF HIM. YOU KNOW IF I EVER HAVE ANY OF MY OWN, I THINK I'LL FEED 'EM BEANS AND TORTILLAS, TOO, THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO GET SOME SLEEP, NIGHTS. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. EVERY CARTRIDGE HAS BEEN FIRED. HELLO. HELLO. WE ONLY FOUND SERGEANT VEGA AND THE BABY. I HAVE THAT, PROFESSOR. RIGHT. YOU SAID VEGA'S REVOLVER HAD ALL CHAMBERS FIRED. YES. ALL. AT WHAT? WE WISH WE KNEW, TOO. THANK YOU AGAIN. THE EMERGENCY UNIT WILL BE IN SAN LORENZO TOMORROW. RIGHT. THAT'S ALL. WE'RE FROM MEXICO CITY. I SAY, WE'RE FROM MEXICO CITY. WE'RE SCIENTISTS. IS THE MAYOR HERE? REST FOR A DAY. ROSA, DON'T LET HIM TRY DO TOO MUCH. PADRE DELGADO, THE ROAD IS OPEN. HELP IS HERE! FROM MEXICO CITY! AT LAST! THANK GOD! ASK THEM IN SPANISH. NO ESTAR UN PRESIDENTE MUNICIPAL? WELCOME TO SAN LORENZO. I AM FATHER DELGADO. ARTURO RAMOS OF THE UNIVERSITY. DR. HENRY SCOTT FROM THE UNITED STATES. I'M AFRAID I CAN'T INTRODUCE THIS ONE. MANUEL TIBURCIO... AND THE PARENTS? THEY WEREN'T THERE. I THINK IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF WE DISCUSSED THIS INSIDE, FATHER. IPERLA! ¿DONDE ESTA PERLA? SEÑOR. DEAD. THEY WERE DEAD. NOW, FATHER, DO YOU BELIEVE THERE'S A DEMON BULL KILLING US ALL ONE BY ONE? PERLA! I'LL TAKE MANUEL. I'LL TAKE HIM WITH ME, BUT I WILL NOT PROTECT HIM FROM THE DEVIL JUST BY LIGHTING CANDLES! GENTLEMEN, I KNOW YOU ARE WEARY AFTER YOUR JOURNEY. CAN I OFFER YOU WHAT HOSPITALITY THE VILLAGE MAY PROVIDE? THANK YOU, FATHER. PERMISO. THAT CAR, FATHER, IT WAS PUSHED IN AS THOUGH IT WERE PAPER. AND FINDING THE SERGEANT... WITH A LOOK OF DEATH NONE OF US HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE. THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME? THE FIRST SUNDAY AFTER THE ERUPTION, VARIOUS OF THE CONGREGATION WERE NOT IN CHURCH. THIS WAS UNDERSTANDABLE, YOU REALIZE. TRAVEL MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE. THEN THE TIBURCIO FAMILY SIMPLY VANISHED. THE FARM, AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED, RAVAGED AS BY SOME GIANT BEING. THERE WERE NO BODIES? NOT UNTIL LAST THURSDAY. SINCE THEN, A YOUNG GIRL... SHE WAS CROSSING THE FIELDS TO SPEND THAT NIGHT WITH SOME COUSINS... WAS FOUND IN THE MORNING. HORRIBLE. THE DOMINGUEZ BROTHERS... RANCHERS... WERE DISCOVERED IN THE GULLY WITH THAT LOOK OF HORROR ON THEIR FACES... AND NO BLOOD. IT'S SMALL CONSOLATION, FATHER, I ADMIT, BUT AS A SCIENTIST, I KNOW WHERE THE EFFECTS ARE SO SIMILAR, THERE MUST BE A SIMPLE, LOGICAL CAUSE. I WONDER HOW SIMPLE, DR. RAMOS, OR HOW LOGICAL. FATHER, WHAT ABOUT THAT STORY ABOUT THE DEMON BULL? THAT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE SUPERSTITION. THE DEMON BULL IS A SYMBOL OF EVIL AMONG THE MANY ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS. ABOUT TWO DAYS AGO, ALL THE WORKMEN ON THE BIG MIRAFLORES RANCH... THAT'S A HUGE ESTATE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FOOTHILLS... DECIDED TO LEAVE THEIR WORK AND COME HERE TO SAN LORENZO. NOW, THESE MEN, USUALLY FRIGHTENED OF NOTHING, SAID THEY WOULDN'T WORK THERE A DAY LONGER. THEY BROUGHT THE TALE OF THE DEMON BULL. HAS MIRAFLORES BEEN ATTACKED, ALSO? CATTLE HAD BEEN FOUND DEAD IN VARIOUS AREAS OF THE RANCH. THEY HADN'T BEEN ROUNDED UP YET THIS YEAR. FOR MILES AROUND, COWBOYS CAME UPON ONE DEAD STEER AFTER ANOTHER. ONE OF THEM HAD HEARD THE TALE OF THE DEMON BULL OF THE MARICOPA. NOW, GENTLEMEN, I DO NOT BELIEVE IT, BUT IT'S AS GOOD AN EXPLANATION AS ANY OTHER. I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT OUR RESEARCH UP HERE MIGHT BE OF SOME HELP. AS DO I, BUT THIS IS NO TIME TO BEGIN. I KNOW YOU'RE EXHAUSTED FROM YOUR JOURNEY AND FROM LISTENING TO ME. TONIGHT YOU WILL STAY HERE, AND MAYBE IN THE MORNING THINGS WON'T SEEM QUITE SO MYSTERIOUS. INDEED, I HOPE SO. HERE WE ARE, ISOLATED, ALMOST CUT OFF FROM CIVILIZATION, HAVING LOST FAMILY OR FRIENDS TO SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN. WE COULD BE IN ANOTHER WORLD. GOOD NIGHT, FATHER. GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, FATHER. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU LATE THIS AFTERNOON. DR. RAMOS, DR. SCOTT, I WILL ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME NOT TO BEGIN THIS UNNECESSARY EXPEDITION. MAJOR GARCIA, DR. RAMOS AND I HAVE ANSWERED ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS. I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN BE OF ANY FURTHER SERVICE TO YOU. NO, I DON'T REQUIRE YOU FOR MY WORK HERE. I ONLY KNOW THAT IF YOU START FOR THAT CRATER AND FIND YOURSELF IN ANY KIND OF DIFFICULTIES, MEN WHO ARE MUCH MORE BADLY NEEDED HERE WILL HAVE TO GO FIND YOU. I'M SORRY. SO THAT'S WHY YOU MUST COME BACK SAFELY, AND BEFORE SUNDOWN, WITH THE ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND MINE. NOW YOU'VE GOT ME. WHAT DO YOU SAY, DOC? SHOULD WE TRY AROUND OVER THAT SIDE OR OVER HERE? NEITHER ONE OF THEM LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE PAN AMERICAN HIGHWAY. EVERYONE'S ALWAYS SAID THAT THE BEST FISSURES WERE ON THE EASTERN SLOPE. YOU CAN SEE THE LAVA THERE. MAYBE WE CAN GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO GET SOME PICTURES AND PLAN OUR APPROACH. SEE A TRAIL UP AROUND THOSE ROCKS? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, BUT I FOUND SOMETHING A LOT MORE INTERESTING. SO? SI, SI, SEÑOR. HERE. HAVE A LOOK. IT'LL DO YOU A LOT MORE GOOD THAN THAT BOTTLED WATER. AH, YES. NOW I SEE HIM. DOC, YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT THING IN FOCUS. THEY'RE FOCUSED, AND IT'S A VERY HANDSOME HORSE, AND I'D LIKE TO GET STARTED. HORSE? THERE WAS A GIRL ON THAT HORSE! COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO GET STARTED AND FIND HER. NOW, DON'T MOVE TOO MUCH. I SAID DON'T MOVE. WE'LL FIND OUT IF YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, FIRST. OH, I'M ALL RIGHT. REALLY. EXCEPT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS MORE GRACEFULLY IF I'D KNOWN SPECTATORS WERE AROUND. NOW, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. GENTLY, NOW. NO BROKEN BONES, SEÑORITA? NO SHARP PAINS? NO, REALLY, I'M ALL RIGHT. I'VE FALLEN OFF LUCERO BEFORE. NOT FOR MANY YEARS, BUT I REALLY CAN RIDE, GENTLEMEN. I'M TERESA ALVAREZ OF MIRAFLORES. HANK SCOTT. DR. ARTURO RAMOS. OH, THE LUCK OF THE ALVAREZ. TUMBLE OFF A HORSE AND LAND RIGHT NEXT TO A DOCTOR. DOCTORS OF GEOLOGY. WE OPERATE ONLY WITH LITTLE HAMMERS ON ROCKS. SAY, HOW 'BOUT THE HORSE? I SAW HIM GALLOP OFF THAT WAY. OH, DON'T BOTHER. LUCERO ALWAYS GOES BACK TO MIRAFLORES, BUT THE SADDLE... I DON'T KNOW. I'LL GET IT. YOU'RE VERY KIND. NO BOTHER AT ALL. DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE A CANTEEN? OH, SURE. RIGHT ON THE JEEP. COME ON. TAKE IT EASY. THERE'S A MIRROR YOU CAN USE. THANKS. WE'LL BE HERE SEVERAL WEEKS AT LEAST. WE'RE CONDUCTING SORT OF A PRELIMINARY SURVEY. AND THEN SOME OTHER BOYS WILL JOIN US HERE SOMETIME NEXT MONTH. YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A VERY INTRIGUING OCCUPATION. IT IS. YOU MEET SUCH INTERESTING VOLCANOES. HEY, HANK! THANK YOU, DOCTOR. I OUGHT TO THANK YOU. I FOUND THIS NEAR THE SADDLE. OH, IS THAT GOOD? I'LL SAY. IT'S OBSIDIAN. THAT'S LAVA THAT'S COOLED. WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW. CATTLE, YES, BUT ROCKS... COULD I ASK ANOTHER FAVOR OF YOU? SURE. WOULD YOU MIND TURNING BACK AND TAKING ME TO SAN LORENZO? BE GLAD TO. OH, THANK YOU. I MUST GET THERE TODAY. YOU SEE, THE TELEPHONE ISN'T WORKING, AND I HAVE TO HIRE RIDERS TO HELP WITH MY CATTLE. THAT OLD VOLCANO IS REALLY CAUSING A LOT OF TROUBLE THIS TIME. WE HEARD IN THE VILLAGE ABOUT YOUR COWBOYS. IF I LOSE MY CATTLE, I LOSE EVERYTHING. HOW ARE THINGS IN SAN LORENZO? OH, SO-SO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO MY VAQUEROS AT MIRAFLORES. SO THERE WAS AN EARTHQUAKE, AND THE CATTLE STARTED EATING SOME POISONOUS WEED WE HAVEN'T LEARNED OF YET. IS THAT ANY REASON TO ACT LIKE FRIGHTENED CHILDREN? I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST A POISONOUS PLANT, SEÑORITA. EVEN IN THIS CLIMATE, YOU DON'T GROW THEM THAT CAN PUSH IN THE SIDE OF A BUILDING AND WRECK A CAR. OH, DON'T FORGET. YOU PROMISED TO USE MIRAFLORES AS YOUR HEADQUARTERS. IT WILL BE A GREAT CONVENIENCE, SEÑORITA. THEN WE'LL MEET LATER? RIGHT. CHAMOCO, FELIPE, JOSE, ALL OF YOU... SEÑORITA, LET ME ASK YOU THIS... IF YOUR PATRON, MY FATHER, WERE ALIVE TODAY, WOULD YOU BECOME FRIGHTENED OF SOUNDS IN THE NIGHT AND RUN LIKE SILLY CHILDREN TO THE SAFETY OF THE VILLAGE? SEÑORITA TERESA, I UNDERSTAND YOU NEED... I SAY ONLY THIS, MUCHACHOS. I'VE KNOWN YOU ALL FOR ALL MY LIFE. WE'VE ALWAYS WORKED TOGETHER. MANY OF YOU WERE BORN AT MIRAFLORES. THAT'S RIGHT. IF YOU DON'T WISH TO RETURN TO HELP ME SAVE MY CATTLE, THEN RETURN TO SAVE MIRAFLORES. ¿QUE DICEN, MUCHACHOS? VAMOS. VAMOS. WE'LL RETURN. GRACIAS. ILOS CABALLOS! VAMOS. DR. RAMOS. DR. SCOTT. MAYOR COSIO WANTS TO SEE YOU. WHERE IS HE? IN THE LABORATORY WITH DR. DELACRUZ. LABORATORY? YOU'LL BE SURPRISED AT THE EXPERIMENTS THAT GO ON THERE. WELL, WHERE IS IT? THIS WAY. DOCTOR, IS THAT THE PATROLMAN? YES. SERGEANT VEGA... WHO LIVED DOING HIS DUTY AND WHO MAY PERFORM A GREATER ONE NOW. PLEASE. WELL? THEY LOOK LIKE SUBCUTANEOUS CELLS THAT HAVE JUST BURST OR RUN RAMPANT. MY ANALYSIS, ALSO, DR. SCOTT. NOT FROM ANY POISON I CAN IDENTIFY WITH THIS EQUIPMENT. LOPEZ, YOUR HELP AGAIN, PLEASE! IN THIS, PURE ALCOHOL. IN THIS, DISTILLED WATER. IN THIS, TEQUILA. IN THIS, WATER WITH SOME SALT. YOU, UH, THINK IT IS A POISON THEN, HUH? I DO. NOT A CHEMICAL POISON, DOCTOR? NO, BUT I BELIEVE, FOR MANY REASONS, THAT THIS IS AN ORGANIC POISON. I HAVE HAD A LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH THEM... THE VENOMS OF THE SNAKES, THE WASPS, THE SPIDERS. I'LL PREPARE SLIDES AND SPECIMENS AND TAKE THEM TO A MAN IN MEXICO CITY WHO WILL BE SURE TO KNOW. VELASCO. YOU KNOW VELASCO? WHO DOESN'T, DOCTOR? WELL, AS YOU SAY, IF IT'S AN ORGANIC POISON, ANYTHING FROM NATURE, THE GREAT VELASCO WILL IDENTIFY IT. YOU SAID FOR MANY REASONS. WHAT OTHER REASONS? WELL, THERE WAS ONLY ONE WOUND... HERE, BUT NO BLOOD. THEN THE SITUATION OF THE TISSUES, THE STRANGE BACTERIA... BACTERIA, I THINK, FOUND IN THE SOIL SAMPLES NEAR THE FOOTPRINTS. FOOTPRINTS? YOU ARE AMAZED. WHEN SOMETHING KNOCKS DOWN DWELLINGS AND FLATTENS CORN FIELDS, IT WOULD BE AMAZING IF THERE WERE NO FOOTPRINTS. I NEVER SAW A MOULAGE OF A PRINT THIS SIZE. WHATEVER IT IS, MY FRIENDS, I DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN A FOOT, A CLAW THIS SIZE EXCEPT THOSE POOR UNFORTUNATES WHO WISH THEY NEVER HAD. ONE QUESTION, DOCTOR. I HOPE I CAN ANSWER IT. THE ALCOHOL, THE DISTILLED WATER, THE SALT SOLUTION... I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT WHAT'S THE TEQUILA FOR? WELL, IN YOUR COUNTRY, I BELIEVE YOU CALL IT THE COFFEE BREAK. HA HA! HA HA! THERE'S THE HACIENDA. IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE QUITE A PLACE. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE PRETTY LUCKY. THE THING REALLY CAME CLOSE, DIDN'T IT? YES. WE WERE BLESSED THAT IT DIDN'T GO ANY FURTHER. OUR PLANTATION WOULD HAVE BEEN RUINED LIKE THE REST OF THE LAND. SEÑORITA, THANK HEAVEN YOU'RE SAFE. WHEN LUCERO CAME BACK TO THE STABLES YESTERDAY WITHOUT YOU, I BEGAN TO SEARCH THE HILLS. OH, PIO, I'D ALREADY BEEN FOUND BY SOMEONE ELSE. THIS IS DR. SCOTT AND DR. RAMOS. THIS IS MY FOREMAN PIO. HI, PIO. THIS WAY. NOT ONLY COMFORTABLE, BUT COOL, TOO. YES, SOMETIMES I THINK BEING COOL IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT ON DAYS LIKE THIS. WELL, I KNOW YOU'LL WANT SHOWERS. FLORENTINA! SHOW DR. RAMOS TO THE BLUE ROOM. SI, SEÑORITA. AND, JUANITO, SHOW DR. SCOTT TO THE LEFT WING. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM! WELL, I'LL SEE YOU LATER, AND YOU CAN TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOUR EXPEDITION. NOT BAD, DOC. FOR HALF A DAY'S WORK, CHAMOCO, NOT BAD. TELL THE BOYS. YES. WE'LL GET THEM ALL BROUGHT IN BY THURSDAY. WHY PUT ON SUCH A FACE? WE WILL DO IT, IF I HAVE TO STAY IN THE SADDLE WITHOUT SLEEP MYSELF. PIO, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? CAN'T YOU SEE THE CATTLE KNOW SOMETHING EVIL'S CARRIED IN THE WIND. LET US WAIT, PIO. ALL WOMEN, CHAMOCO. NOW LET US HAVE A GOOD SUPPER AND FORGET THESE SUPERSTITIONS. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME BRANDY, SIR? YES, THANK YOU. JUST A MINUTE. JUANITO, HURRY WITH THE BRANDY. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME, TOO? PLEASE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM. MUCHAS GRACIAS. MAY I MAKE A COMPLAINT, TERESA? OH, I'M SORRY. WHAT WAS NOT DONE SUITABLY? WELL, THAT'S JUST IT... EVERYTHING WAS DONE BEAUTIFULLY. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO THINK ABOUT SETTLING DOWN TO WORK. WELL, IS THAT SO BAD? THAT ALL DEPENDS. IT MIGHT BE VERY BAD IF I STOPPED THINKING ABOUT WORK ALTOGETHER, AND JUST STARTED CONCENTRATING ON PLEASURE. HANK, THOSE VOLCANOES HAVE BEEN THERE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. I'M SURE THEY WOULDN'T MIND WAITING JUST A LITTLE LONGER. I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TWO TO BE DISCUSSING VOLCANOES. I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU. OH. I NOTICED IT LAST NIGHT AT THE VILLAGE. SEE ANYTHING? HOLD IT UP AGAINST THE LIGHT. THAT'S FANTASTIC, DOC. WHY, THERE'S A SCORPION TRAPPED IN THERE. I THINK SO. A FEW HUNDRED YEARS OLD, BUT THERE HE IS. I WANTED TO SHOW YOU BEFORE I BROKE IT OPEN. ALIVE! IMPOSSIBLE! JUANITO, BRING A JAR! I CAN'T BELIEVE LIFE ENDURING FOR CENTURIES LIKE THIS? AND UNDER ALL THAT HEAT? VELASCO WILL CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED IN THIS. HERE, JUANITO. PARDON ME, SEÑORES. DO YOU LIKE TO KEEP SCORPIONS? I KNOW A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE MILLIONS. NOT LIKE THIS ONE, JUANITO. PANCHO! PANCHO, IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE, I'LL SEND YOU OUT. I WANT A MAGNIFYING GLASS TO WATCH THIS LITTLE MONSTER. YOU KNOW, I COULD THROW THIS SCORPION OUT THE WINDOW, THEN WE'D REALLY BE ALONE. IT'S SIMPLER THAN THAT... WHY DON'T WE GO OUTSIDE? WHY DON'T WE? OH, EXCUSE ME. THE LINE'S BEEN FIXED. HELLO? HELLO? JUST TESTING THE LINE. OH, IS THE LINE ALL FIXED? ALL CLEAR, MA'AM. MIRAFLORES WAS THE LAST ONE, SEÑORA. AAH! AAH! GAYETANO! WHAT? WHAT'S UNDER THE BRIDGE? NO! IN THE ARROYO. HANK, COME HERE! LISTEN TO THIS. HELLO? HELLO? HELLO. WHAT'S WRONG? LOOK OUT! RUN, GAYETANO! GET TO THE TRUCK! AAH! AAH! AAH! WHERE IS THE ARROYO BRIDGE? I'LL SHOW YOU. PANCHO, WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU TONIGHT? KEEP QUIET. DOC, WE HAVE TO GO OVER TO THE BRIDGE. THERE'S SOME TROUBLE. COME ON. NOW, YOU BE A GOOD BOY. COME BACK HERE! PANCHO! PANCHO! GET BACK HERE! PANCHO! PANCHO! PANCHO, GET BACK HERE! PANCHO, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU TONIGHT? PANCHO! COME BACK! I'LL GET YOU! SEÑORITA! WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE CATTLE? I CANNOT SAY! HELP! WHY, THAT'S JUANITO! RUN, JUANITO! GIVE ME YOUR GUN! CALL FOR HELP. IT'S A GIGANTIC SCORPION! WHERE IS JUANITO! HE'S SAFE! OPERATOR. OPERATOR! OPERATOR! PLEASE, HURRY! OPERATOR! I SHOT AT THAT THING A DOZEN TIMES. MUST BE AFTER THE CATTLE. HANK! JUANITO, COME ON! QUICK! COME ON INTO THE JEEP! QUICK! DR. VELASCO. DR. RAMOS, I HOPED I'D FIND YOU HERE. THIS IS FANTASTIC. DR. VELASCO. THANK GOD, FATHER. WE THOUGHT YOU WERE ALL DEAD. THIS IS ALL THAT REMAINS. EVEN THE ANIMALS... I CANNOT SPEAK OF THIS NIGHT... EATEN... DEVOURED. FATHER, I HAVE BEEN SENT HERE IN CHARGE OF EMERGENCY ARRANGEMENTS. ALL THAT ARE LEFT WILL BE MOVED TO SAFETY. CERTAINLY. PLEASE TELL EVERYONE TO BE READY TO LEAVE SAN LORENZO. AND, FATHER, THEY MAY ONLY TAKE WHAT THEY CAN CARRY IN THEIR ARMS. VERY WELL. WHERE IS THE LABORATORY? IT'S OVER THERE. AS SOON AS I RECEIVED THE SAMPLES, I IDENTIFIED THE POISON AS THAT OF A SCORPION, BUT I HAD NO CONCEPT OF THE CREATURE'S SIZE UNTIL I SAW THIS... AND THIS. THIS SPECIMEN FOUND BY DR. RAMOS IS OF A SPECIES THOUGHT TO BE EXTINCT SINCE THE TRIASSIAN ERA. WE HAVE KNOWN IT IN A FOSSIL STATE, BUT NEVER ALIVE. NOW FROM THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH, IT HAS COME FORTH AGAIN TO PLAGUE THE EARTH. I EMPTIED THE MACHINE GUN AT ONE OF THEM. I BEG OF YOU ALL NOT TO LOSE YOUR HEADS... IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD. BUT WE HAVE A FEW ADVANTAGES AGAINST THIS ENEMY. FIRST... THEY COME OUT TO EAT ONLY AT NIGHT. THUS, WE HAVE THE DAYLIGHT HOURS TO TRY FIND AND DESTROY THEM. SECONDLY... THEY'RE SOMEWHAT SLOW AND LETHARGIC... UNTIL INFLAMED BY THE SMELL OF BLOOD. I STILL ASK ONE QUESTION, SIR. YES. WHAT WEAPON DO YOU INTEND TO USE? GAS... POISON GAS. IT HAS BEEN PROVED EFFECTIVE AGAINST NORMAL SPECIES. LET US PRAY IT WORKS AGAINST THE SCORPIONIDA REX. IF IT DOES NOT... MAY GOD HELP ALL OF YOU. BE READY AT DAWN. IS THAT ALL OF THEM, LIEUTENANT? I WANT TO DO WHAT I CAN, TOO. SEÑORITA ALVAREZ, I UNDERSTAND YOUR EMOTION... BELIEVE ME, DR. VELAZCO, I'M NOT TRYING TO BE EMOTIONAL. I WOULDN'T ASK TO COME ALONG IF I THOUGHT I COULDN'T HELP. TERESA, YOU DON'T KNOW THE HARDSHIPS... DR. VALAZCO, MAJOR COSIO, I KNOW THIS AREA LIKE THE PALM OF MY HAND... BETTER THAN ANY MAN HERE. I'M A GOOD SHOT. YOU SAID YOURSELF YOU NEEDED ALL THE HELP YOU COULD GET. SEÑORITA ALVAREZ, I THINK YOU HAVE FOUND YOURSELF A JOB. GENTLEMEN... MAJOR COSIO AND I ARE PLOTTING THIS. NOTE WHERE THE VARIOUS INCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED. I WANT TO GO WITH YOU! I WANT TO DO A JOB! DON'T WORRY, JUANITO. WE'LL GET TOGETHER AGAIN. THAT'S A PROMISE. SEE IF YOU CAN FIND MY BOOTS FOR ME, WILL YOU? I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. HERE THEY ARE! OH, GOOD! THEY ARE VERY, VERY FINE BOOTS. KIND OF LIKE THOSE, HUH? MM-HMM. TELL YOU WHAT, JUANITO. WHEN YOU GET TO BE A BIG MAN, I'LL GET YOU A PAIR JUST LIKE THESE. I THANK YOU, MR. HANK. YOU'D LIKE THAT, HUH? UH-HUH. I KNOW HOW TO RIDE VERY GOOD. I KNOW HOW TO SHOOT VERY GOOD. I'M 7 1/2 YEARS OLD. THAT'S ALMOST A HALF A MAN. A HALF A MAN? AH, JUANITO. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES EVEN A HALF A MAN HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT JOBS TO DO, AND RIGHT NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB FOR YOU TO DO IS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR GRANDMOTHER. SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF. I KNOW, BUT... YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO DO MORE EXCITING THINGS. AND YOU... YOU BE VERY CAREFUL, AND DON'T GET HURT. WON'T YOU? DON'T WORRY. I PROMISE. AND A FULL MAN NEVER BREAKS HIS PROMISE. HA HA! O.K. I DON'T SEE A THING, DR. VELASCO. MIGHT AS WELL GO ON. ALL RIGHT. MAJOR? YES, DOCTOR? TELL YOUR CAPTAIN TO HOLD ALL THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT UNTIL WE CALL FOR IT. OK, DOCTOR. HERE IT IS. A GREAT BIG OPENING! I GUESS HE FOUND IT, DR. VELAZCO. YES. LOOK, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIS HORSE! HE'S FALLING IN! AAH! LET'S HURRY UP THERE, HANK! COME ON. LET'S GO! WE MUST GET DOWN TO THE LOWER LEVEL. THIS CREVICE IS NEW. IT MUST HAVE OPENED DURING ONE OF THE EARTHQUAKES. THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB FOR US, DOC. OF COURSE. NO CHANCE FOR MENDOZA? EH... HOW DEEP DO YOU SAY IT IS? WELL, DOC AND I HAVE BEEN DOWN MANY A CAVE, BUT THERE'S NO WAY OF REALLY TELLING UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY HIT BOTTOM. WELL, THE ONLY WAY WE CAN FIND OUT IS TO TRY TO GO DOWN THERE OURSELVES. WHAT DO YOU SAY, DOC? RIGHT. DR. VELAZCO, WILL THAT POISONOUS GAS WORK IN A CREVICE THIS BIG? I COULD NOT ANTICIPATE SUCH A VOID AS THIS. IT MAY DISSIPATE. MAJOR, I THINK YOU BETTER BRING ALL YOUR HEAVY EQUIPMENT UP HERE... CRANE, TANKS, AND ALL. CAPTAIN... BRING THE CRANE AND ALL THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT. YOU WANT MY MEN TO GO DOWN THERE? IT IS SUICIDE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. DOC AND I HAVEN'T HAD A DECENT ELEVATOR RIDE IN A LONG TIME. HANK, PLEASE, NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M A STOWAWAY. LOOK, JUANITO. DO ME A FAVOR, WILL YOU, AND JUST STAY OUT OF THE WAY. YES, MR. HANK. GOOD. AND JUST SIT IN THE JEEP LIKE A BIG BOY, OK? PUT THESE IN THE CAGE. WHY THE BIRDS, PROFESSOR? BECAUSE IF THE BIRDS STOP SINGING, THAT MEANS THERE'S POISON GAS IN THE CAVE. HANK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT. NEITHER OF YOU. IT'S NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT? THE POLICE. THE ARMY. THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE... NOW, LOOK, DOC AND I KNOW MORE ABOUT CAVES THAN ANYONE ELSE HERE. WHY DID YOU DO THAT? MAYBE I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT YOU'D DO. WHAT DID I DO? YOU DID ALL RIGHT. SEÑORITA... YOU CAN HELP US IF YOU WILL KEEP THE LOG OF THE DESCENT... HOW MANY METERS DOWN, REPORTS WHICH ARE MADE. SURE. KEEP YOURSELF BUSY. THAT'S MY THEORY. OH, AND DON'T FORGET... TAKE CARE OF LITTLE JUANITO. ALL RIGHT, TAKE IT DOWN. DOC, LOOK DOWN THERE. STOP. STOP THE CAGE A MINUTE. STOP! HANK, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? IT'S THE HEAD OF A SCORPION IN THE WALL. HOLD ON A SECOND. OK, I GOT A PICTURE OF IT. LOWER ON. ALL RIGHT, LOWER THEM DOWN. WE'VE JUST HIT BOTTOM. WERE IN A HUGE CAVERN... I'VE NEVER SEEN A CAVE SO BIG IN MY LIFE. CAN YOU SEE ANY SIGNS OF MENDOZA? WELL, NOT FROM HERE. WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AROUND. WELL, THE BIRDS SEEM ALL RIGHT. YEAH. ARE YOU THERE, HANK? HANK? ANSWER. ARE YOU THERE, HANK? DR. RAMOS. DR. RAMOS. HELLO. HELLO? HELLO? YES? MENDOZA'S DEAD. WE JUST SAW A WORM 30 FEET LONG. HANK, PLEASE COME UP! HANK! WE WANT TO LOOK AROUND MORE FIRST. HEY, DOC? OVER HERE! MUST BE A NEST OF 'EM. YEAH. DOESN'T EVEN PENETRATE IT. TRY ANOTHER ONE. NO, WAIT! THAT MUST BE THE GRANDDADDY OF THEM ALL. THAT'S HOW THEY KILL EACH OTHER... WEAK SPOT IN THE THROAT. THAT MUST BE IT. MR. HANK! HELP! HELP! HELP! HELP! MR. HANK! IT'S JUANITO! HELP! HELP! HELP! HELP! MR. HANK! HELP! HELP! MR. HANK! STAY BACK IN THE CAVE, JUANITO! COME ON, JUANITO! I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STAY IN THE JEEP. WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE?! I CAME TO HELP YOU. TO HELP US? OH, COME ON. MR. HANK! MR. HANK! LOOK! WHAT'S CAUSING THAT? DR. RAMOS! HANK! ARE YOU THERE? ARE YOU THERE, DR. RAMOS? HANK, ANSWER ME! BLOCK THE CRANE! IT'LL BE PULLED IN! THROW SOME ROCKS UNDER THAT CRANE! THERE GOES OUR CAGE, GAS TANKS, EVERYTHING. THERE'S NO WEIGHT ON THE CABLE. OH, NO. HERE, TAKE THE CABLE, DOC. SEND IT BACK DOWN AS FAST AS YOU CAN. BRING IT IN SLOW. MAYBE THEY'RE ON IT. PLEASE PULL IT UP! KEEP BRINGING IT IN. KEEP GOING, DOC! HANG ON, DOC. YOU CAN MAKE IT! KEEP GOING! COME ON. HOLD ON! HOLD ON! WHAT HAPPENED TO HANK? HANK AND JUANITO ARE DOWN THERE. GET A LOOP ON THE CABLE AND SEND IT DOWN QUICK! MAKE A LOOP ON THE CABLE. OH, JUANITO! OH, JUANITO, WHY DID YOU DO IT? I TRIED TO HELP THEM. IT'LL BE DARK IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THOSE SCORPIONS WILL BE COMING OUT AGAIN. YOU COULDN'T USE THE GAS? NO. WE LOST IT IN THE MOLTEN LAVA. THERE MUST BE ABOUT 50 OF THOSE THINGS DOWN THERE. CAN'T WE CLOSE THAT OPENING WITH DYNAMITE AND SEAL IT? YOU HAVE NO IDEA AS TO THE SIZE OF THAT PLACE. WAIT TILL YOU SEE THESE PICTURES. I WANT THOSE PICTURES. I EVEN HOPED TO GET A SPECIMEN. YOU COULDN'T GET ONE OF THOSE THINGS OUT EVEN WITH THIS CRANE. MAJOR, WE MUST TRY TO SEAL IT SHUT WITH AN EXPLOSION. WE MUST TRY BEFORE NIGHTFALL. I THOUGHT YOU SAID SCORPIONS COULD GO FOR MONTHS WITHOUT FOOD. THE GIANTS DON'T LAST THAT LONG.. THEY EAT THEIR OWN WEIGHT EVERY 3 OR 4 DAYS. SUPPOSE THEY FIND ANOTHER WAY? THOSE... THOSE PASSAGES DOWN THERE? THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE THEY HAVE APPEARED. THIS, PROBABLY, IS THEIR ONLY EXIT FROM THE CAVERN. MAJOR? LET'S CLOSE IT. YES, DOCTOR? READY? LET HER GO! I GUESS THAT DOES IT. MIDNIGHT... WHEN EVERYONE GOES BACK TO WHAT HE WAS BEFORE. HMM. THIS ISN'T THE END OF ANYTHING, NOT FOR US. IT'S THE BEGINNING. HANK, ALL OF US HAVE DONE OUR WORK NOW, AND THANK HEAVEN IT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT ANY MORE TRAGEDY. AND YOU STILL HAVE YOUR SURVEY OF VOLCANOES TO MAKE YET. WELL, THAT'S FINE. I'LL BE HOME EVERY NIGHT FOR DINNER. I HAVE TO LEAVE AT ONCE. I SHOULD HAVE LEFT FOR THE STATES TWO MONTHS AGO TO BUY CATTLE FOR THE HERD. YOU'LL BE IN MEXICO CITY FOR A WEEK FIRST. I'LL FINISH UP MY WORK HERE WITH DOC, AND I'LL MEET YOU THERE, AND YOU CAN SHOW ME THE TOWN. EVEN IF WE DO HAVE, WHAT? A DAY, TWO DAYS? I DON'T WANT TO SETTLE FOR JUST TWO DAYS, HANK. I DON'T WANT JUST TWO DAYS, EITHER. I DON'T FOOL PEOPLE. I DON'T WANT THEM TO FOOL ME, EITHER. I'M NOT, DARLING. I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH INDEED, AND I WANT YOU VERY MUCH. DR. SCOTT. HELLO, I CAN HARDLY HEAR YOU. THIS IS DR. VELASCO. OH, DR. VELAZCO. HOW ARE YOU, SIR? WELL, WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED, FINALLY. YEAH. RIGHT NOW. HANK, I REGRET TO HAVE TO COMPLICATE THE PLANS YOU AND DR. RAMOS HAVE MADE FOR SO LONG BUT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN MEXICO ARE VERY, VERY ANXIOUS TO TALK TO YOU BOTH AT ONCE. WELL, I, UH... I DON'T REALLY THINK THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN ADD TO WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW, DR. VELAZCO. I AM WITH THE DIRECTOR OF CIVILIAN DEFENSE AND HIGH ARMY OFFICERS RIGHT NOW, HANK. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU BOTH RETURN HERE AT ONCE TO COMPLETE YOUR REPORT. I DON'T LIKE TO SAY THAT YOU COULD BE ORDERED. WHAT'S THE TROUBLE? EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL, ISN'T IT? THERE'S NO CAUSE FOR ALARM... NOT AT ALL. BUT A REQUEST FOR COOPERATION HAS BEEN MADE BY... BY A GOOD NEIGHBOR TO THE SOUTH... WELL, IF YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT... LOOK, WE'VE ALREADY POSTPONED THE TRIP FIVE TIMES. I GUESS ONCE MORE WON'T MATTER. WHAT? OH, A PLANE, YES. SURE. THAT WOULD HELP A LOT. OH, UH, DR. VELASCO... DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE WOULD BE ROOM FOR THREE ON THAT PLANE? OF COURSE THERE'LL BE ROOM FOR THREE. ALL RIGHT, SIR. YES, SIR. I UNDERSTAND. RIGHT. SEE YOU THEN. HASTA LUEGO. DID HE SUSPECT? NO. I DON'T THINK SO. HE ASSUMES THAT THE DANGER IS COMPLETELY OVER. THAT'S FINE. YOU SEEMED VERY WILLING TO POSTPONE OUR TRIP ONCE YOU LEARNED THAT TERESA COULD RIDE WITH US ON THE PLANE. WELL, AT LEAST IT WAS SOME SORT OF AN INDUCEMENT. MY FRIEND, REMEMBER, THIS IS NOT THE BALCONY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD MOVIE THEATER. THIS IS MEXICO. WHEN A MAN SHOWS AS MUCH ATTENTION TO A GIRL AS YOU HAVE, ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S IN A CATHEDRAL AND WONDERING HOW HE GOT THERE. SO? WHAT HAVE YOU GOT AGAINST MARRIAGE, DOC? I TRY REMEMBER WHAT MY FATHER TOLD ME ONE TIME... HE SAID, "ARTURO, EVERY CHILD IN THE WORLD "IS BORN SINGLE. "PLEASE TRY TO PROFIT MORE THAN I DID BY THE EXPERIENCE." HA HA HA! DR. RAMOS, DR. SCOTT... I AM VICTOR ESTEBAN. DR. VELASCO HAS ASKED ME TO TAKE YOU TO HIM AT ONCE. RIGHT AWAY? WHAT ABOUT SEÑORITA ALVAREZ? I HAVE ORDERS TO TAKE SEÑORITA ALVAREZ WHEREVER SHE WISHES, BUT YOU GENTLEMEN MUST ACCOMPANY ME TO THE UNIVERSITY. ALL RIGHT. FOLLOW ME, PLEASE. GENTLEMEN, WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN UP YOUR OWN PLANS TO HELP US. WE MUST APOLOGIZE FOR BRINGING YOU HERE UNDER FALSE PRETENSES. IT'S NOT A NEIGHBORING COUNTRY WHICH NEEDS YOUR HELP. IT IS OUR GOVERNMENT. SEÑOR MORENO, OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS A POSSIBLE DANGER AGAIN... 20 YEARS FROM NOW, ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE. IT IS NOT A POTENTIAL DANGER, GENTLEMEN. WE ALL FEAR IT'S ALL TOO REAL, AND NOT 20 YEARS FROM NOW. PERHAPS IN LESS THAN A MONTH. DR. VELAZCO, MAYBE YOU'D BETTER FILL US IN FROM THE BEGINNING, HUH? YES, OF COURSE. I'M IN CHARGE OF AN AERIAL MAPPING PROJECT FOR OUR GOVERNMENT. RECENTLY, OUR PLANES WERE PHOTOGRAPHING THE AREA NEAR SAN LORENZO. GENTLEMEN, PERHAPS IF YOU WOULD SIT DOWN AND TAKE A LOOK. ALL RIGHT. PUT OUT THE LIGHTS. NO. NOT NEAR THE CITY. IT IS ONE OF THEM. NOW YOU'RE CONVINCED OUR FEARS ARE JUSTIFIED? I DON'T LIKE TO DISAGREE, BUT MERELY BECAUSE A DEAD SCORPION WAS FOUND TRYING TO MAKE ITS WAY TO THE SURFACE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE DIDN'T DESTROY THEM ALL WHEN WE DYNAMITED. NOW, THIS SCORPION MAY HAVE JUST BEEN ONE... EXCUSE ME, SIR. THAT'S THE SAME THOUGHT THAT OCCURRED TO US. WE RECHECKED OUR PHOTOGRAPHS. ON THE 21st, TWO DAYS AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE, THE SCORPION WAS NOT THERE. HE WAS NOT THERE UNTIL THE DAY AFTER YOU EXPLODED THE DYNAMITE, AND YOU THOUGHT YOU DESTROYED THE SCORPIONS. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT AT LEAST ONE SURVIVED THAT EXPLOSION AND ALMOST SUCCEEDED IN REACHING THE SURFACE. SWITCH THE LIGHTS ON. GENTLEMEN, WE MUST PROCEED AS IF THERE ARE MORE OF THEM LEFT. EXACTLY WHERE IS THIS AREA WHERE IT WAS PHOTOGRAPHED? SOUTHWEST OF THE VOLCANO, ALMOST DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM THE FISSURE WHERE YOU AND DR. SCOTT DESCENDED. YOU WILL SEE, HERE IS THE FISSURE. THIS IS SAN LORENZO. IT WAS HERE, EXACTLY HERE, THAT THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN. GENTLEMEN, I STILL THINK YOU'RE MAKING A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A MOLEHILL. DR. VELASCO KNOWS HOW THAT MOUNTAIN WENT WHEN WE BLEW IT UP. NOTHING COULD LIVE UNDER THOSE TONS OF ROCK. NOT IF THEY WERE UNDER THE ROCKS, NO. I DON'T THINK I QUITE FOLLOW YOU. FROM YOUR DESCRIPTION, WHAT DR. VELASCO TOLD US, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE CAVERN INTO WHICH YOU 2 MEN DESCENDED IS PART OF CHAMILCA CAVES, HUGE TUNNELS THAT RUN UNDER THE EARTH AT DEPTHS UP TO 5 MILES, MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN MAPPED IN THE REGION AROUND MEXICO CITY. SOME ARE FLOODED, PART OF THE UNDERGROUND LAKES. YES, I'VE HEARD IT. HERE THEY ARE. NOTICE HOW THIS LARGE FISSURE HERE IS DIRECTLY ABOVE THIS ARM OF THE SYSTEM. THIS LARGE POCKET HERE IS EXACTLY THE PLACE WHERE YOU TOOK YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS. NOW, ALSO NOTE THAT HERE, WHERE THE SCORPION WAS PHOTOGRAPHED FROM THE AIR, IS ALSO PART OF THE CONNECTING SYSTEM. THE SCORPIONS COULD EASILY HAVE FLED UNDERGROUND TO ONE OF MANY UNDERGROUND SHELTERS. AS YOU THOUGHT, AT THE TIME, COULD HAPPEN, HANK. WHAT'S THAT LONG ARM THERE? THAT'S A CAVERN WHICH EXTENDS SOUTHWARD TO WITHIN 30 MILES OF MEXICO CITY. THERE IT LIES UNDER THE RAILROAD. THIS IS WHAT WE WONDER... HOW MANY OF THE SCORPIONS MIGHT HAVE DECIDED TO RUSH HERE, AND WHEN WILL THEY DECIDE TO COME TO THE SURFACE... AFTER BLOOD? SO THAT IS WHY WE BROUGHT YOU HERE. THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE WANT YOU TO ADDRESS A GROUP OF SCIENTIFIC AND MILITARY EXPERTS SO THAT WE MAY PLAN FOR ANY EMERGENCY. WHAT KIND OF RIFLES WERE YOU USING? HOW POWERFUL? WELL, THE CARTRIDGES I WAS USING ARE SUPPOSED TO PENETRATE 2 INCHES OF STEEL. BUT THEY DIDN'T STOP THE SCORPIONS. HOW DO THEY KILL EACH OTHER? THE THROAT. THERE'S A SMALL SPOT RIGHT HERE THAT HAS NO ARMOR. THAT'S ITS WEAK POINT. WHEN THEY ATTACK EACH OTHER, OF COURSE, THEY HAVE THE POISON TO INJECT INTO THEIR ENEMY'S THROAT. CAN YOU DUPLICATE THE POISON? NO. NOT WITHOUT A GIANT SCORPION. WHAT WE NEED IS SOMETHING THAT WILL PENETRATE THAT SMALL AREA EXACTLY AND THEN SEND SOME SORT OF POISON INTO THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS. WHAT IT COULD BE, I HAVE NO IDEA. WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME DILEMMA, BUT WITH THE MEETING ON FRIDAY, I'M SURE WE WILL REACH A SOLUTION. GENTLEMEN, I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING WE HAVE DISCUSSED HERE IS ABSOLUTELY SECRET. THIS IS A CITY OF FOUR MILLION PEOPLE. IF WORD OF THIS LEAKS OUT, THE PANIC OF THE POPULATION COULD BE WORSE THAN THE SCORPIONS. NICE DRESS... NICE GIRL. WELL, THANK YOU. I'M GLAD YOU CAN SEE ME IN SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES CLOTHES I WEAR AT THE RANCH... FOR TWO DAYS, AT LEAST. SO AM I. HANK, WHAT'S THE MEETING ON FRIDAY ABOUT? OH, SOME GEOPHYSICAL CONFERENCE DR. VELASCO ROPED US IN ON. CIGARETTE? NOT RIGHT NOW. AFTER YOU FINISH THAT, WHERE AM I TAKING YOU FOR DINNER? HANK, IT'S ONLY 9:00. THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. DO YOU REALIZE THIS IS MEXICO CITY, AND NO ONE HAS DINNER BEFORE 11:00 AT NIGHT? SOMETIMES MIDNIGHT. WHY, IT'S PRACTICALLY AFTERNOON RIGHT NOW. LOTS OF MEN ARE JUST LEAVING THEIR OFFICES. OH, AM I GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE WITH YOU! WELL, YOU WORK ON IT, TEACHER... I THINK YOU CAN SOLVE ME. NICE WORK. CAVIAR... AREN'T YOU OVERDOING IT A BIT, HANK? I'VE GOT TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON YOU IN 48 HOURS THAT WILL LAST FOR TWO MONTHS. WHAT'S THE MATTER, DON'T YOU LIKE CAVIAR? OH, I LOVE IT, BUT I MUST SAY I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S SO EXPENSIVE. WELL... IT'S A WHOLE YEAR'S WORK FOR A STURGEON. IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL THESE PAST TWO DAYS. I WISH THEY'D NEVER END. THEY DON'T HAVE TO. FOR A WHILE THEY DO. I WISH YOU'D CHANGE YOUR MIND. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AWAY, AND THAT VOLCANO CAN WAIT. NO, YOU'LL GET THROUGH WITH YOUR SPEECH TOMORROW, AND YOUR SILLY EXPEDITION, AND I'LL DO EVERYTHING I HAVE TO DO. AND THEN WHEN WE COME BACK WE WON'T HAVE A WORRY IN THE WORLD. AAH! AAH! HELP! AAH! WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM TO BRING YOU A NEWS BULLETIN. THE EXPRESS TRAIN FROM MONTERREY HAS BEEN DERAILED OUTSIDE OF MEXICO CITY. EARLY REPORTS INDICATE AN APPALLING LOSS OF LIFE. THERE ARE EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS WHICH STATE THAT MONSTER SCORPIONS HAVE SWARMED AROUND THE WRECKAGE, CREATING HAVOC. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. WE'RE TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO THE EMERGENCY AREA. REPORTS TO THIS MOMENT FROM ALL AVAILABLE HOSPITAL AND EMERGENCY FIELD UNITS INDICATE THAT MANY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE DISASTER ARE SO BADLY INJURED, THERE IS LITTLE HOPE OF THEIR SURVIVAL. ALL AMBULANCES, PRIVATE CARS, TRUCKS, AND OTHER VEHICLES, HAVE BEEN COMMANDEERED BY THE AUTHORITIES IN THIS EMERGENCY. WE'VE RECEIVED A VERIFIED REPORT FROM THE SCENE OF THE WRECK CONFIRMING THAT 129 PERSONS ARE KILLED AND HUNDREDS UNACCOUNTED FOR. SURVIVORS REPORT THAT A GIANT BLACK SCORPION HAS ATTACKED AND KILLED THE SMALLER SCORPIONS AND IS NOW HEADED FOR MEXICO CITY. WE WERE TRYING TO FIND YOU. WHAT CAN WE DO? YOU CAN HELP US SOON ENOUGH. WE'RE STILL NOT SURE HOW MANY OF THEM ARE LEFT, BUT I BELIEVE THE LARGEST MAY BE THE ONLY ONE. WITH THEIR LUST FOR BLOOD AFTER THE WRECK, THE SCORPIONS WENT MAD. THE LARGEST KILLED 4 OF THEM, AND I THINK MAY HAVE KILLED THE REST OF THEM. WHERE IS THIS SCORPION? WE'VE LOST IT IN THE HILLS, 10 MILES OUT OF TOWN. BUT IT'S APPROACHING THE NORTHWEST AREA OF THE CAPITAL. YES. YES! IT HAS BEEN SEEN. LET'S GO! ATTENTION! ATTENTION! THE CITY IS UNDER MARTIAL LAW. ALL INHABITANTS LIVING NORTH OF TACUBAYA AND WEST OF GUADALUPE ARE ORDERED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES. FOLLOW THE ORDERS OF THE POLICE. LISTEN, DARLING, YOU GET IN THAT BUILDING AND STAY THERE. GO ON. THE SCORPION HAS NOT YET REACHED THE CITY. IT HAS NOW BEEN VERIFIED THAT ONLY ONE GIANT BLACK SCORPION IS ALIVE. THE PUBLIC IS WARNED THAT THE CITY WILL HAVE A COMPLETE BLACKOUT. A DEFENSE RING IS BEING SET UP COMPLETELY SURROUNDING THE AREA WHERE IT WAS LAST SEEN. AUTHORITIES ARE TAKING ALL POSSIBLE PROTECTIVE MEASURES. OBSERVE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. PROTECT YOUR HOMES FROM FIRE HAZARDS. THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN THROWN INTO A STATE OF PANIC, ADDING GREATLY TO THE BURDEN OF THE AUTHORITIES, AND THREATENING TO DISRUPT COMMUNICATIONS VITAL TO THE DEFENSE OF THE CITY. IF RIFLES AND CANNON WON'T STOP IT... MAJOR COSIO HERE. YES! WE'VE NARROWED THE RING ONE MILE. OPERATION IS PROCEEDING. OK, THAT'S FINE. HAVE MAJOR ORTEGA MEET US IN FRONT OF THE STADIUM WITH THE WEAPON. MAJOR ORTEGA, MAJOR ORTEGA, THIS IS DR. VELASCO. MEET US IN FRONT OF THE STADIUM WITH THE WEAPON AND GENERATOR. BUT WHAT KIND OF WEAPON? I HOPE IT IS A WEAPON. JUST NOW IT IS ONLY A PRAYER. DR. VELASCO? YES. TELL COLONEL SANCHEZ TO MOVE ALL THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT INTO THE STADIUM. COLONEL SANCHEZ. COLONEL SANCHEZ? DR. VELASCO HERE. MOVE ALL THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT INTO THE STADIUM RIGHT AWAY. THE PROJECTILE ENTERS THE THROAT. IF I'M LUCKY, DR. VELASCO. BUT I'VE NEVER USED A WEAPON LIKE THIS BEFORE. ATTACHED TO THE PROJECTILE IS A COPPER WIRE, THEN THE INSULATED WIRE, WHICH LEADS TO THE CABLE AND THE GENERATOR. IT SHOULD GIVE 600,000 VOLTS. THIS MEAT SHOULD BRING HIM IN HERE. I HOPE SO. IT'S ABOUT THE ONLY WAY WE CAN CORNER IT. YOU MIGHT NEED MORE THAN ONE SHOT, MAJOR. SEÑOR MORENO. YES, YES. THE SCORPION IS FOLLOWING THE MEAT WAGON. THERE IT IS. THE THROAT, MAJOR. REMEMBER, THE WHITE AREA ON THE THROAT. THE HEAD COMES BACK JUST BEFORE IT STRIKES. RIGHT. YOU MISSED! I WON'T MISS THIS TIME! UH... TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF! AAAEEEH! TURN IT ON! TURN IT OFF! NOW WE CAN SECURE SOME OF THE ACTUAL POISON FROM THE SCORPIONIDA REX ANALYZE IT AND CREATE A SIMPLE PROTECTION AGAINST THEM IF EVER AGAIN. HANK, VELASCO WANTS TO... GENTLEMEN, WE MUST NOT WASTE ANY TIME. IF WE COULD ALL MEET TOMORROW AT MY LABORATORY FOR A RECAPITULATION. HANK, SEÑORITA ALVAREZ... WE HAVE NOT YET FINISHED. NEITHER HAVE WE.
