They're nothing but boys with breasts. - I disagree. It has to be in you to be gay. - Yeah, but I'm not gonna have her force our daughter. - I'm going to check on Angela. - Yeah, you do that. - Angela baby I know you don't wanna move. Actually neither one of us wants to move, but we have to. - But why mommy, why? - Because it's too far for your father to get back and forth, to work every day. - But why can't he just move and we stay here? - Angela, baby don't be like that. - But mommy what about Tarnel? - You'll make new friends at your new school, you'll see. - I don't want to make any new friends.

You know you're psycho, right? But yeah that's him. Girl he's everything I ever wanted. Handsome very smart determined and I love his sense of humor. My man keeps the smile on my face. Let me stop bragging. - That's what's up. Ain't nothing wrong with bragging on your man. I wish I could find somebody who wasn't on bullshit. I'm happy that you found true love finally. - Me too, girl. It was way overdue. - Oh don't I know, pretty soon I thought you were going to end up with your best friend Tarnel. - Why would you say something like that? - Because she's in love with you. I don't know how you don't see it. I mean, she always gets upset when y'all don't spend time together. - I don't think so. That's just how she always been ever since we were kids. We're just close like that. - Yeah okay. One of these days, you gone end up telling me that I was right. Watch my word. - Whatever. Anyway, Ryan just got over here. So I'mma talk to you later, okay. - All right, talk to you later. - All right. (soft music) - Oh my God babe this food is so good. I might have to make you Mrs. Stevenson sooner than i thought. - Yeah about that. Are you two divorced or are you two just separated? - No baby why you telling me that we're divorced. This being separated is over with you. To be honest with you I couldn't be with that woman if I really wanted to. She's crazy as hell. - Well, what did she do to make you feel that way? Honestly, I don't even want to talk about it. Just know that she messed up for any woman in the future and that's it. - Messed it up like how ? - I don't want any more kids in life. - But children are a blessing to bear. - Yeah that's what I used to think. Until I had children with that woman. - You can't hold it against every woman just because of your bad experience with her. - You're right. You're totally right. And that's why I don't have a problem with dating right now. - I guess. - I mean if it's going to be an issue for you, let me know. - No, not at all. - Okay. - I don't think so. - That's even better, so if not can you pour me some more wine. Because that wine is really good. - Sure Ryan. Anything for you. (Upbeat music) - How did you know I was at the gym? - As if I don't know your gym bags. We did used to go together remember before you was all caked up. - Yeah, anyway what made you come up here? - Unfortunately this the only time I get to see you nowadays. - C'mon that's not true and you know it. - It is true, ever since you fell in love. - Aaaww my best friend jealous she might her place. - It's not even like that. I'm just keeping it real. - Yeah whatever. Seriously what made you come up here? - Can we go have a drink and talk. I need some advice. - Yeah that's cool, come ride with me. We'll come back and get your car. - Everything all right? Something on your mind. - I mean it's not a lot on my mind. I'm just kind of confused about something. - Confused about what exactly? - Well, you know, Ryan and i been together for about eight months now and I'm really in love with him Tarnel. His family loves me and I love him just as much. - Then what seems to be the problem? - Ryan wants to get married. - Married! Don't you think it's too soon for y'all to talk about marriage? - Well, not really eight months in a lesbian relationship, about what two years. - Ha ha ha asshole. - Okay but seriously, I would marry Ryan. I mean, of course not right now it is kinda too soon. I'm still surprised that he took me to meet his parents. - Big deal, you met my parents what 14, 15 years ago. - Tarnel Thomas will you cut it out and listen. I really need to figure this out. - Go on. - Ryan is everything to me, he's charming, handsome, thoughtful. He's everything I ever wanted in a man, it's just one issue. - He's gay. I knew he was gay, man he looks like he's gay. - He's not gay you ass can you just be serious for one minute? - All right. - He doesn't want to have kids. - Like I said he's gay. (indistinct) - Whatever he say it's cause he already has two kids and he claims he doesn't wanna have anymore. - But that's not fair to you though. How can he want to marry you but not make you a mother? - I mean, I kind of understand where he's coming from. - I swear you settling. - It's not even like that Tarnel. - Really can you please tell me what it's like then? - I don't even want to talk about it no more. Let's just drop it. - No, I don't want to drop it. I really think you need to reconsider taking this guys seriously. He may not even be the one for you. - Well that you seem to know everything Tarnel. Why don't you tell me who's the one for me then? Hello, exactly. That's what I thought.

How are you doing this evening? - What's going on with our mom? - As you know, she has stage four breast cancer. - Breast cancer. Since when? This got to be a mistake. - It's not a mistake and I do apologize. I thought she informed you. She's had it for some time now. - Oh, she must have kept it a secret from us. - What can we do at this point? - At this point there's not much we can do. - What do you mean? It's gotta be something we can do. - What about chemo? - Your mom has already had four rounds of chemo therapy and radiation. - Wait, what if she got her breast removed would that help? - She's had a double mastectomy. Her prognosis is looking really slim. It's already metastasized. The other organs are shutting down. I remember her going to the doctor and saying something about getting a breast reduction due to back problems, but she must have lied about that. - I can't confirm that. But what I do know is that she only has two weeks to a month at the most. - A month? - Your mom has been through a lot. She's been fighting really hard. I need you girls to stay strong. She's comfortable right now. You can see her when you're ready. I'll give you a moment. - Okay. - Sorry. - I can't believe this, why did this have to happen to our mother.

It doesn't matter. - Baby no, what is she talking about? Oh my God. (indistinct) Baby no, are you okay? Baby. No. - Hey baby. - Hey baby. (TV speaking) (laughs) Baby what happened to your face? - Babe don't trip but I popped up over at for Ryan's house. Cause I aint liked the way he'd been dogging Angela. And he had some chick over there and I busted him out in front of him. So he hit me. - You just told me not to trip. What did you say? What did you do? - Ava don't start the shit with me please I'm not in the mood. - Tarnel, why did you go over there? You have nothing to do with their business. I told you before Angela is a big girl. She can take care of herself. Stop running behind her Tarnel. - Because that's my best friend. I don't like the way you've been treating her. - Tarnel why you just can't stay out her business. - Ava she is my business. - How so Tarnel, it's because that's your best friend or are you still in love with her aren't you? - You know what? I swear. You know what you was just so insecure. - Insecure. You made me insecure. How the hell you going to tell me when we first got that you was still in love with your best friend and have been ever since you guys was kids. I know the feelings just didn't go away because you met me. I know they didn't Tarnel. - Key word I was in love with her. Now I'm in love with you. Could you please stop bringing her up? - Yeah I'll stop bringing her up and you got to stop captain save a whore because if you don't this wedding is over. Come here baby come here. You hurt? - I was just trying to be there for my friend. - I know but she a big girl. She got it. - I guess you right, thank you. I love you. - I love you too. (indistinct) - It was. - Stacy. - What's up? - How do you know when you're really in love with someone? - What kind of question is that? I mean aren't you in love with Ryan? - Can you just answer the question? - Okay damn. Okay. How are you usually know I'm in love with someone is when I can't stop thinking about them. They're the first person I think of in the morning and the last person I think of before I go to bed and I get butterflies every time we spend time with each other and no matter how much time goes past it just doesn't go away. - Wow. - What? It's true. - That's exactly how I feel about Tarnel. - Tarnel? What the hell Ang you gay? Well remember When I said, when you said watch your words. Well you were right. But it's not just her that feels like that the feeling's mutual. I mean, at least I hope it is. - Okay. So what you're telling me is that you're in love with Tarnel. Ang you're like eight months pregnant. - If Lisa stop throwing all your stuff away you wouldn't have to keep buying all this shit. - I'll start throwing her stuff away. - You need to man. - Hold on I'll be right back. - We need to finish this conversation. - I'll be right back i seen someone I know. - All right I'll be in the federal room. - You always got jokes man. - Kam Ren hey. - Hey wasssup. Kam can I talk to you alone for a minute? - I guess so. - Oh all right. You know what. - Yeah gotchu. What's going on? - So how you been? - I'm doing all right. I'm just trying to find something for the wedding tomorrow. I think I'm going with this. - No, no. - What's going on with you? - I'm been a little under the weather lately and plus this pregnancy is got me feeling sick all the time. I won't even be able to make it to the wedding. - Really? - Well I hope you feel better. I'm gonna go ahead and finish getting the gifts for tomorrow. - Kam I need some advice. - All right talk to me. - Okay, how do I put this? - Wait, let me guess Tarnel finally told you how she feels about you and now you want to be friends with her right? - What? Tarnel supposedly told me what? And what do you mean how she feels about me? - So that's not what you're talking about? - No. - I'm gonna go ahead and let you finish saying what you were saying. - Yeah, please because you're confused. Anyway. I think I'm in love with Tarnel. - What? - I know. I mean I don't know where these feelings came from, but it's true. - And what makes you think that you're in love with her? - Well, ever since we were kids, I knew I loved Tarnel. At the time, I didn't know what those feelings were and plus I didn't want none of my parents know so I just pushed them away as much as possible. - So why now? - Well, for one I'm not gay. Wait, does this make me gay because I'm in love with her? I'm so confused. - I can't believe y'all. - What do you mean? - Tarnel feels the exact same way about you. - Wait, she does. How do you know? - How do I know, I'm her best friend and maybe because you're the only person she talks about anytime we go anywhere but she's not going to tell you because she doesn't want to ruin the friendship. - Really? - Yeah. - This is great. I need to go let her know how I feel. - Actually I don't think that's a good idea, honestly. I mean, why did you wait until today considering the fact that she is getting married tomorrow. - I know but these feelings just dawned on me. You don't think I should tell her. - Honestly yes and no. I mean, she loves you, but she's just as much as love with Ava and they're getting married tomorrow. I think you're too late. - Kam come on. I need your advice. If it were you would you want me to let you know how it felt especially if you felt the same way about me. - I mean, I don't know if you tell her now she'll either one resent you, two hate you for the rest of y'all lives--- - Or what? - Or she'll thank you for saving her from making the biggest mistake by marrying the wrong woman. - Thank you so much, Kam. - I'm gonna let her know how I feel. - Hey just remember we never had this conversation. - Okay. - Mommy sit here. - Hello. - Hello Ava. - Who else would it be? - Is Tarnel available? - Not really hold on. Tarnel your phone. - Who is it? - Angela. - Tell her I'll call her back. - Okay. She's busy right now. She'll call you back when she have like time for you. - Okay.

She's about to get married. - Okay, why not? - What we gone do then? - We wait. - What we waiting for? - Right right, why are we waiting? If Tarnel is in love with Angela we need to tell her right now. - No Tarnel was in love with Angela. She's in love with Ava. They about to get married remember. - Man this is some real life drama for you. So we're not going to tell Tarnel that Angela loves her. - No, that's not our place. - All right. I hope I'm making the right decision. - We are. I just text Angela like I was Tarnel and I pretty much just told her to come save me from making the biggest mistake of my life. So she gone tell her. - Yo little slick as man, all right man. I hope you know what you're doing? - C'mon really always. - I know.

We gather here in the eyes of God today. Before I begin, I want to ask is there anyone here who objects to the marriage of Ava and Tarnel speak now or forever hold your peace. (coughs vehemently) - Oh, somebody get you a glass of water or take him to the back so I can begin. - I was choking, I'm good. - Are you Sure? - Go ahead. - Once again, if there's anybody here I should say here to ruin the wedding of Ava and Tarnel speak now or forever hold your peace. - I do. - Angela what are you doing? - Ryan leave me alone. It's over between us. You can go back to your wife and two kids. - But I thought--- - Well you thought wrong just like I did. Now have a seat. I have some unfinished business to take care of. - Angela what are you doing? - Something I should have done a long time ago. Letting you know how I really feel about you. - What? - Look you make a mistake if you marry her. You not in love with her, you in love with me. And I'm in love with you too. - Wait, what? - Plus I got your text telling me to come save you from making the biggest mistake in your life. - Tarnel what is she talking about? - What text? You know what disregard that text cause I wasn't the one that sent it. Look can you please have a seat so he can finish marrying us. - This isn't a joke Tarnel. I'm serious. I'm in love with you. And I'm sorry, it took me so long to realize it, but better late than never right? - Wrong. - I know she's not trying to ruin my day. I just know she is or I will physically hurt her Tarnel. You better get her. - Babe I got this. - Come here, get your ass over here. What is wrong with you huh? Angela what's going on? - Tarn I didn't realize that you were in love with me. - Who told you that? - It doesn't matter. What matters is that I'm in love with you too. - Where's all this coming from. - Tarn all this time I've spent looking for Mr. right and she was right up under me. I didn't even realize it until this week. - Ang you not even a lesbian, plus you care too much what people say if they saw us in public together. - Tarnel I love you. And I'll admit at first I was too afraid to love you because of what other people thought. But now I realize no one else's opinion matters, but yours and mine. Before my mom passed away, she told me to follow my heart. And that's what I'm doing. - Your mom told you that.
