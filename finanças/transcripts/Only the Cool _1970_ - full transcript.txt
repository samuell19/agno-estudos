Torpedo?s Skin Are you alright ? Did you have too much to drink ? That?s it, too much to drink. He?s my husband. - Is he ? You don?t have to comment. - I don?t. He?s an antique dealer I?m not an antique dealer. Are you ? - I?m not either. You?re what they call a fop, ain?t you ? - Yes, a fop. A play-boy. Something of a pimp ? - No, absolutely not. My parents have lots of money. Do you collect fops ? Do you go at Regine?s often ? Alone, never. With my husband, from time to time. But your husband is away. Away for long ? I don?t know. He was supposed to come back yesterday. And he?s coming back tomorrow ? - I don?t know. Careful. It?s straight. So, since you?re furious, you decided to get drunk and bring a fop back home. Is that it ? Do you really want to make him jealous ? - Shut up. I don?t like threesomes. You?re going to go now ! I?m asking you to. You?re going to get the hell out of here right now, do you hear ? Yes. I'll leave the two of you alone. Get out ! Now ! Do you hear me ? Now ! Don?t you want to leave your things ? - It?s a quirk, you know. Oh, no. No, don?t put the light on. I must be a mess. Don?t look at me. Stay another five minutes. From now on, you?ll have to be very composed. Yes. Nothing will have disappeared. Nothing will have been forced. Tomorrow, you?ll go to your office as usual. You?ll do your job as usual. - Yes. That?s good. Come to think of it, you?re a bad boy. No, I?m not. This is the first and last time that I do this. And are you sure you?re doing it for me ? - For you and for me. Because you love me ? - Yes, because I love you. Won?t you get it wrong ? - No. This is my table. The key is in the right-hand drawer. I know. Are you cleaning up ? - You know I like order. Don?t be afraid. I?ll be here the day after tomorrow, with the money. Yes. Will you think about me ? - Of course. Secretariat. Direction of Research. Yes ? - It?s me. Everything?s fine. Yes, very well. Listen, you have to do something. You must go and fetch something I hid under the bridge. Under the bridge... - Yes. Yes. - I don?t want to take that with me. You?ll understand. I tell you that you?ll understand. Yes, I?m off to Paris. The day after tomorrow. I?ll be here the day after tomorrow. Do as I tell you, right now. Nicolas, I love you. - So do I, kid. Thank you. No, thank you. Go on, shoot ! Fran?oise ! Phone call ! Yes. I was waiting for your call. Well... no, I?m a little tired. Today, I?m going on holidays. Three or four days. Yes, it?s absolutely necessary. Oh, by the way, your janitor says you must go to the post-office as soon as possible. Something about a parking ticket, I think. A letter for you. - Thank you. Towers of Notre-Dame, 15h30, Fran?oise. There?s an alert and the network is in security retreat mode. H?l?ne orders to sever all contacts. - What about me ? You must vanish. Vanish in what hole ? Not my place, I guess. No. Mine. I?ve been living in the Rue Massillon for four days. It?s very close from here You must wait for H?l?ne?s orders there. Alright. No news is good news. I beg your pardon ? Nothing. Just thinking about my wife. Right now, I?m in Florence, appraising Renaissance bronzes. I should have been home yesterday. You?ll tell your wife that the flu kept you in a hotel in Florence. Yes. I needed that. Let?s go. I already moved six times this year. - Do you have fun being a letter box ? It would be too long a story. - I?m not asking you to tell it. I?m sick of it. Do you hear ? Sick. If you?re not here tomorrow, I swear I?ll sleep with some bloke. Any bloke. Do you like it ? - It?s nice, as far as cells go. Where shall I sleep ? This is a bed. - What about you ? It?s a double bed, isn?t it ? - Yes, it is. Do you allow me to put my flu to bed ? - I can even buy you rum and aspirin. If you have something to hide in the flat, do it while I?m out. How much ? - Almost 39?. Drink your rum toddy. May I tell you something unpleasant ? - Yes, go on. If I were H?l?ne, I wouldn?t use you. - Oh ? Why ? Because you?re a... narcissist. All those pictures are a bad sign. I?ll post twice as many on the walls tomorrow. To make it look even worse ? - No, to prove I like a challenge. That?s a woman?s reaction. - Are you a misogynist ? If I were, I wouldn?t obey a woman?s orders. You would obey anyway, since you chose our profession. It?s not a profession. It?s a belief. H?l?ne is not a woman anyway. What about me ? - You, I don?t know. Appearances are against you, in any case. Good night, Nick. - Good night, Fran?oise. Don?t worry. You?re safe here. I?m just a little letter box of no consequence. Very safe, very airtight. With no importance whatsoever. It?s a copy, isn?t it ? No, madam, mister Krestowitz never sells copies. Heavily restored. - No, madam. The canvas was changed, of course, but that?s all. Obviously, it would be necessary to inspect the nails. But I assure you this arm, here, was restored with putty. No, madam, this is dried veneer. - Oh ? Do you really think so ? I?m sure of it, madam. And what is the price ? - One million ! What ? One million including the new canvas, the veneer, the putty, the nails, the restoration. and when you sit on it, it shatters ! Are you interested ? One million ! But... but... it?s im... - Yes, madam, it?s possible. You?re not interested ? Goodbye, madam ! But this is insane ! - Yes, it?s insane. You?re a madwoman. - Yes, madam. Mister Krestowicz never sells copies but he lets his wife down. So you don?t have any news ? - Of course not. No phone call ? Not even a letter ? You know perfectly well that he never writes. Not to me, he doesn?t. To you, maybe. Do you like being his accessory ? Accessory to what ? - His affairs. His escapes. His loves. You?re exaggerating, really. - Yes, of course, I exaggerate. Do you think it normal that a husband doesn?t call his wife when he?s 48 hours late ? Come on, you know he never calls when he?s travelling. You?re used to it. I?m getting unused fast. Personally, you see, I think that Mr. Nicolas is on a good deal. On a trail. He?s sniffing a couple of things, he smells, he follows, and nothing exists for him anymore. - What if the object is a woman ? Oh, really, no ! - How do you know ? I don?t, obviously... - Well, shut up, then ! Did H?l?ne tell you to stay home ? - As much as possible. My orders are to play possum in your company. For a routine alert, the penalty is four days in reclusion. Eggs, sardines, yoghourts, jam and continental toasts. Are you hungry ? - No, thank you. Your turn. - Oh, I?m fed-up, excuse-me. Yes, yes. I don?t want to go home. May I sleep here ? Of course you can sleep here. Sometimes I wonder why I?m his wife. Is it the first time he's done this ? - What ? Not letting you know anything. - No. He travels. He disappears. I married a draught. Didn?t you tell me he was in Italy ? - Yes. He?ll be here tomorrow or the day after. - I don?t care. I?m sick of it. Cheat on him. - I try, but it?s pathetic. Do you cheat on Christian ? - Sometimes. Yes, I?m sick of it. - No, you?re jealous. Well, yes I am jealous I?m very jealous. Believe it or not, I think it?s normal when you love a man. Do you think it?s monstrous ? - I don?t. Not at all. Maybe he had an accident. - They never have accidents. I?ll make your bed. - No, don?t bother. I?ll sleep with you. As you wish. We?ll cry together. Hello, Percy ? - Good morning, madam. No, madam, no news from him, absolutely nothing. I?m so sorry. - Alright, thank you. Yes, see you soon. Nothing ! Did you have tea ? - No. Did you sleep well ? - Very badly. If you take sleeping pills and waking up tablets, you?re going to ruin your nerves. If you?re sorry you let me stay, just say so. Gee, if you take it that way, screw you, Dominique. Screw you too. Screw all of you, him, you, your ugly pooch, all of you ! Of all the... Do you hear, Merlin ? Just because madam?s husband cheats on her with a fat chick he picked-up in the street, she says you?re ugly. Poor Merlin. What are you saying ? - Me ? Nothing. Talk, Laurence. You?re going to talk or... - Alright, alright... I?ll talk. Calm down, honey. As I was saying, I met Nick the day before yesterday, in Paris, with a... well, a woman on his arm. I followed them due to silly curiosity and that?s it. Rue Massillon, 8, 3rd floor. I had a glimpse of Nick through the window. It?s not true. Open the door. Where is he ? I know he?s here. What do you want ? - Where is he ? Leave it be, Fran?oise. This is my wife. No. - Who told you I was here ? Don?t touch me. - How did you learn that I was here ? Bastard. Bastard ! Who gave you this address ? I promise you you?re going to talk. But she?s mad ! This is a madwoman ! His name is not Nicolas Balsier. He doesn?t live Rue Ramet. He certainly is no insurance salesman. His ID is a fake. Fran?oise Oscarssen. Born in Copenhagen. A model. That?s true. French mother, wife to a Danish man. That?s true. He was settled here since at least 48 hours. He didn?t like to move around since the janitor never saw him go up or down the stairs. Other than these, no personal things. Not even a razor. Yes, I?m with you, go on. I want your pics and report on my desk as soon as possible. Alright, bye. Bullshit, as usual ? - Yes. The bloke on the 2nd floor saw black hair, a mackintosh and a revolver. The woman on the 1st floor mentions a giant woman in a fur coat. None of this is simple. - What?s not simple ? The fact that the man and the girl seemed to be living like siblings. Oh, yeah ? And also that he doesn?t look like either a pimp or a gangster. Yeah... Can we take them away ? - Yes. Choufert ! Go with them to the fridge. Have him shaved, dressed and his picture taken. OK On your way back, stop at the hospital and inquire about the girl. Gregor ? How are you ? Good ! You?re going to cruise in the vicinity of the Rue Massillon, number 8 I said "the vicinity". Something happened between Fran?ois Oscarssen and Nicolas Balsier. The rendez-vous is at 11 pm. See you then. Hi, how are you ? - Hi. Leaving tomorrow ? - No, tonight. Hitchhiking ? - No, she doesn?t want to. We?ll take a truck. 2000 francs. 2000 francs to go to F?camp in a lousy truck. Will you stay there long ? Don?t know. It will depends on the mate who?s supposed to get us on a boat. Do you want to come ? We?ve got space. - What would I do in F?camp ? Nothing. - That?s what I?m doing here. Bye. May I go with you ? Fran?oise and Nicolas have been offed. There?s only a vague description of the woman who shot them. Nicolas is dead. Fran?oise is seriously wounded. What are they saying in the neighbourhood ? Everybody thinks it?s a crime of passion. Where was Fran?oise taken to ? - To the H?tel-Dieu hospital. Tomorrow morning, you?ll buy a spray of roses and wait for me at 8:15, at the Ch?telet underground station, as usual. With roses ? - Why ? Do you prefer tulips ? Gift-wrapped, please. It?s a present. That is a SS ring, isn?t it ? It?s a Nazi cross. No, it?s a swastika. A solar symbol. Long hair. Rings. Ribbons. And you think it?s normal ? Is short hair normal ? - Yes it is. Can you picture me driving my truck with rings and things, and a ribbon around my head ? You dress up and don?t do anything. Do you think it?s normal ? And driving bananas in a truck, is that normal ? But what would happen if everybody decided not to work anymore ? Love. - What ? Love would happen. - All of this will end badly. Why should we give a shit ? But your girl is going to have a kid, isn?t she ? With the Chinaman, we?ll manage. What Chinaman ? - My son. Here you are. Doesn?t it smell nice ? Yes ? Yes. Yes, thank you. The lab confirms the perfume killed her through osmosis or inhalation. Do you know that kind of stuff, doctor ? To tell the truth, I... - A perfect crime anyway. Good work. INSURANCE SALESMAN MURDERED IN HIS MISTRESS' HOME The young, wounded Swedish girl died this morning in the hospital without having woken up. Nicolas Balsier, p. o. Box, number 7 Nicolas Balsier, the mysterious insurance salesman lived Rue Ramey, 69. But the street includes only 67 numbers. Thank you, madam. - You?re welcome, sir I insist. Not everyone thinks as fast as you do. 54 pages. You?ll get the Xeroxes in one hour. My dear friend, the Balsier case doesn?t concern us anymore. It now concerns these gentlemen. Alright, commissioner. Of course, inspector, you?ll go on investigating the case. Yes, I understand. As a fa?ade. If you want to put it that way. Just in case you?d find information, please send it directly to the commissioner. From now on, we?ll handle the press communiqu?s. Alright. These gentlemen would like you to sum up for them everything you know about the case. No, don?t sum up. On the contrary: we?re interested in the slightest details. Take a seat, Tarmodel. Go on, inspector. Did you lose something ? This is the Captain Pleyben, if you?ll allow me. And there, the Minerva ! A centenarian Spanish ship sailing on clutches. And I?m Gianni. I?ve got a very low draught, I?m my own captain and my only crew. And I was built thirty years ago. Are you from Paris ? - Why ? Because... it shows, doesn?t it ? Do you know the Andromeda ? She sailed three days ago. Friends of yours ? I was supposed to sail with them. Well... except if you swim to join them... Are you a sailor ? What do you do ? - Nothing. I?m a janitor. A janitor with no lodgers. - Here ? No. There ! Can you see the derelict trawler between the two grey ones ? I?m her janitor, her guardian. She?s the Star of the South. A derelict trawler but a constellation of the first magnitude. If you don?t have anything better to do, the visit is free, and I refuse tips. - No, thank you. It?s a gift. Do you like fruit ? So I pull out the tarpaulin and what do I see ? This. So I say, shit, what is this ? At first, I thought it was a toy, some plastic thing. But when I picked it up, boy, did I understand. So I brought it here at once. My wife told me: mind your own business. I told her: well... Wanted, a thirtyish woman with chestnut hair, known to be armed Then I thought about it and I said, no, I?ll bring it to the police station. So you had three passengers, is that it ? Two were the tramp type. well the youth of today type, I mean. Dressed up. A bloke and his girl. Or his wife for all I know. And there was another girl, but of another type entirely. Rather clean. - Can you describe that woman ? Quite good-looking. Chestnut hair. Call Paris as soon as she?s spotted. Do not arrest her. They all look alike now, you know. A mackintosh, well, properly clothed. Absolutely not like the other two. Do you feel better ? - I apologize. No, really, I do. I?d never seen a dead person before. It?s awful, isn?t it ? One gets used to it. You?ll see. You were saying that Mrs. Krestowicz called you yesterday morning ? That?s it, yesterday morning for the last time. She phoned several times the day before, by the way. I felt she was worried, nervous. Very much so. What about today ? Did she call you ? No, no news. Strange, isn?t it ? - Maybe. I?m going to be dead drunk. I never drink alcohol. First dead body, first booze-up. Do you know her ? No, not at all. Who is she ? - A girl. And you are... ? I really didn?t picture policemen like this. - Come on, come on. You?ll have to pay double for a night visit. Do you like it ? This is the deck. Here, port. There, starboard. Here is the prow. Over there is the stern. You know a lot of things. I?m the only master on board. But, if you want, you can be my XO. A ship?s apprentice will do. - Very well. You?ll be an apprentice. Do you know anything about sailing terms ? The prow, the stern. Port, starboard. - Great. And this is the hold. Follow the guide ! I?ll show you the walking forest. Look. What do you think ? - Shakespearian. Half-turn ! Now I?ll show you your room. - My room ? Why ? Just in case. If I indulged myself, I?d welcome everybody who?s in a jam aboard my building. But I don?t indulge myself. You?re wrong. I?m not in any jam. - Good for you. It?s none of my business, anyway. But you?re a little lost, ain?t you ? What about you ? - Me ? From the day I was born, I?ve been lost. Love trouble ? - Do you like asking questions ? I don?t listen to the answers. This is my place. So this is your place. What about you ? - I?ve got all the rest. I?ll be back, get settled. Here it is. And this. And this: new. Here we are. Breakfast is between 8 and noon. Will that be alright ? Yes, thank you. - Thank you, Jean. Thank you... Jean. You?re very... - Do you think so ? I?m sure of it. - If you say so. Good night. You?re wanted on the phone. Paris. - Thanks. The suspension has to be tightened. I?m taking off the track as soon as I reach 280 km/h. Hello ? Yes ? Yes... I see. Three o?clock ? OK. Krestowitz was an agent of great value. I?m sure he fulfilled his assignment. If the microfilms were in Fran?oise Oscarssen?s home, there?s 99 chances out of 100 for them to be now in possession of the Special Services. And 99 out of 100 for the apartment to be watched in the hope that we try to secure them. I received categorical orders: we must go on with the operation at all costs. Krestowitz stayed last in the Rue Massillon. The orders are to systematically search this last refuge. Did you tell them that the police would be waiting for visitors ? They don?t care about the visitor?s fate, but about the result. Even if there?s almost no chance of success ? I?m just one gear in a huge machine, Fedor. And the visitor... will be me ? - Yes. I chose you. You?ll go to the Rue Massillon tonight, 3 am. You?ll get out at 5 am. If they watch the place, they will let you proceed. Then they?ll follow you like hounds, so that you lead them to one of our addresses. If you?re not followed, I?ll wait for you in the parking lot in Cluny. If you are, of course, ignore that contact. What if Krestowitz? wife has got the microfilms ? Did you think of that ? - Yes. Maybe Nicolas was careless and his wife discovered his activities. Maybe she even works for another network. She knows too much in any case. I hope we can neutralize her before she's arrested and talks. The service sends me two Torpedoes, who?ll stay at my disposal in order to act on the slightest clue. While my part is to stick my head in the lion?s mouth. You can refuse. - What if I do ? I?ll go myself. You know perfectly well that I won?t refuse. Here, in case you fail. You can keep it in your mouth: the covering is hard and insoluble. You?d have to bite very hard to break it. What if I unwittingly swallow it ? Insoluble even in gastric juice. Every possibility is anticipated, isn?t it ? We?ll separate here. I thank you. Believe me: I?m very happy. Do you understand me ? - Yes. Some things are sometimes impossible between two beings but... although they?re impossible... one can try to prove them. Yes. I?ll prove what you know, H?l?ne. Or maybe what you didn?t know. Yes, I knew. I don?t like buildings. I don?t like the subway. I don?t like week days. I don?t like the office. I only like luxury hotels, I only like dough. I only like Sundays, I only like mink. I only like cars, I only like caviar. I only like stars, I only like Jaguars. Did you write this song ? - Yes, yes. Words and music. Alright, go on. I like only holidays, the snow and the sun. I don?t like to get up when the alarm clock rings. The only thing I want is to spend some bread To own a yacht because that?s what?s really smart. Yes, I had every gift. That?s why I became a loser. What about you ? Do you have any gift ? - No That is not possible. Everybody?s got a gift. Let?s say I could have loved a man. And it didn?t work out, did it ? - Yes it did, quite well. Nobody should be unhappy on such a night. Who says I?m unhappy ? - I wasn?t referring to you. I won?t confide in you, Jean. Even on such a night. I?ve already told you that I?m not asking anything. This is your home. Here, you can stay for one year. For one hundred years. I like you. But you?re wrong in thinking that I?m unhappy. Tonight, it?s the opposite. I don?t like buildings. I don?t like the subway. I don?t like week days. I don?t like the office. Central ? This is F1. Fox just got out of number 8, heading for the Rue d?Arcole. Did he spot you ? - No, I don?t think he did. Central, alerting F2. Fox heading for the Rue d?Arcole. - F2. Got it. He?s going to try to ascertain whether he?s followed. He knows that if we?d found the documents, we would already have intercepted This is F2 alerting F6. Fox in Rue d?Arcole, heading for Notre-Dame. This is Central, F2. Has Fox spotted you ? - No, I don?t think so. He should have looked back several times. He acts like a bloke who knows he?s being followed. For a professional, it?s a flaw. This is F6, this is F6. Fox in a Renault cab, 4810 UD 75. This is Central. Got it, F6. Follow him. Alert F12 and F16. This is F12. Cab spotted. F12 ? Follow him. Don?t lose him. This is F6. Fox going up the Boulevard St. Michel. F1, F14, F17 will now go to F9, F30, F34. Now, he?s going to pretend he?s going somewhere in particular, in order to slip out of our hands at the first opportunity. Drive ! Come on, now, drive ! This is F6. Fox entering Rue de I?Arriv?e, heading for Gare Montparnasse. Alert F23. F23, this is Central. Fox in Renault cab 4810 UD 75, Rue de I?Arriv?e, heading for Place Bienven?e. This is F23. Cab spotted. Fox is heading for Gare Montparnasse. This is F17. Fox is heading for the platforms. F17 ? If he passes through the control, follow him. This is bullshit. He doesn?t wait for anybody. He just waits for us to make an error and capitalize on it. F12, F23, F17, do not let Fox out of your sight. If he flees, chasing him is forbidden. Fortunately the train was late, but two hours. It?s not my fault, I was blocked in a traffic jam. Thank you. - I?m really sorry. This is F34. Fox leaves the station, he?s heading for the exit. It couldn?t last, he had to find something else. This is Central, alerting all posts. Fox is about to come out of Gare Montparnasse. This is F23. Fox in bus number 94 to Levallois. To the Parc Monceau. What gate of the Parc Monceau are you going to ? Boulevard de Courcelles. No, don?t take your clothes off. - What do you want then ? Now, leave me alone. I?m going to take some rest. You can?t stay here more than one hour, you know. I?ll be gone before that. You really don?t want to... ? - No. Not today. OK, the game is over. - Shall we pull him him ? Nothing else left to do. You two, stay outside. Come in. We?re going to talk for a while. I?m sure we?ll find a way to get along. Now, we?ll have to find something else. Dominique Krestowicz, the suspected murderess of her husband and his mistress, could be in F?camp. Unknown man commits suicide in hotel. I bet you were looking for me. My name is Pavel Richko, I?ve got a Finnish passport, and I?m coming to France with a serious business project. You?re a friend. You?re welcoming me at Le Bourget airport. I kiss you. You?re mad. Smile, please. Now ! That?s an order. See how easy it is ? Now come with me. I love blue Gauloises. Do you know Paris ? Quite well. Do you need a guide ? - No. I was trained in the Western groups. Blue Gauloises, please. There are always two of us, didn?t you know ? I did. - Do you have a car ? Yes. But I?m not going with you. And I always thought that women, in Paris... Please ! I?ll wait for you at my place, at 6 pm. Rue Flagui?re, 36. Don?t forget. Well, what?s new ? Nothing in the files. Mute fingerprints. Clothes, dental records, photographic matches: nothing ! No need. This is the kind of dead man who will never talk. Here is the toxicological report. - Strychnine ? Yes, but of a very special kind. We may have something of interest. The secretary of the factory where Krestowicz stole the documents was found. Did you see her ? - She?s mute too. Drowned Autopsy ? - No result. Four dead bodies in four days. Our clients are serious. The next one will be Mrs. Krestowicz. Why ? They do know that we have the microfilms now. They can?t be sure. France-Soir ? I?d like to talk to Claude Lambert. Yes, thank you. Also, since she knew one of the network?s hiding places, they have to assume that she knew others. She?s condemned anyway. Did we report her presence in F?camp ourselves ? Yes. And we?re going to let them know a little more. Hello, Lambert ? This is Coster. Who?s that ? - James Bond. Not very cheery, this place of yours. I did some shopping. Just what I always dreamed of. What do you think ? I think we don?t have the same tastes. Don?t you think this is stylish ? Too bad. Oh, I also bought... Dominique Krestowicz was spotted by our contacts in F?camp. It?s a port on the Normandy coast. We?ll leave tomorrow. So soon ? Next time you?ll ask for some time off in order to shop. You?re just jealous of my night-robe. I?m not surprised. You?re a monk. So we leave tomorrow ? - At the earliest hour. Tomorrow morning, I?ll be in a terrible condition. Tonight, I?m doing "Paris by Night". If you care to join me ? - No. Why not ? Because I never planned an operation this way, and because I don?t think it?s a good way. Don?t you trust me ? - No. My superiors are of another opinion. On the contrary, they trust me absolutely. And the strangest thing is... I deserve it. Where are you from ? A convent ? Let go, please. Why ? Are you ashamed to be a woman ? - No. Then you?re afraid to be a woman. I?m asking you to be ready tomorrow at 7 am. I?ll pick you up at your hotel. No. - You refuse to go ? Tomorrow at 7 am, I?ll be in F?camp. I?ll be waiting for you at 10, at the corner of roads N40 and D211. I remind you I?m responsible for this operation. And I remind you that I can choose my ways and means as I please. As well as the colour of my night-robe. See you tomorrow. Have you ever met Dominique Krestowicz ? No, never. She?s on a boat moored in the F?camp harbour. The Star of the South. Is that all ? Our contact in the area adds: research over. Which means: your move. Emotional temper. A slight tendency to hyperthyroidism. Impulsive. Likable. Our only chance is closing in from the sea. It?s time. Did I sleep long ? One hour. Do you have one of these ? - Yes. So do I, as you can see. - I can. I?m sorry I woke you up earlier. I wasn?t sleeping. I was dead. - Dead ? Yes. Isn?t that what you thought, while you watched me sleeping. How do you know I watched you ? - Instinct. Hello, chief ? This is Ziegler. Nothing to report for now. Over. Thank you, Ziegler. Tomorrow, lads, we shall give up and nick the woman. But who... who are... ? Is that you, Jean ? Hello, Chief ? This is B?rault. I can?t see clearly but I think something is happening on board. Don?t stay here. Come. Muret, go with her. This time, you lost. Yes... This time, you won. I?m all ears. My back is broken. I?m going to die. A man can live with a broken back. I was working on my own. You couldn?t work on your own. You came from the sea. I?ve got nothing to say. I?m in pain. In my armband?s pocket, there?s a capsule. Give it to me. - Not yet. Go patrol along the coast. Hurry up ! We?ll heal you anyway. You?ll talk anyway. If you do now... I know. A new identity. And money. It?s the rule of the game. Those who accept are always found again. We got her. - Dead ? No, alive. It?s not true. It?s true. And she?ll talk. It?s not true. Alive, I tell you. I don?t need you anymore. And I?ll do you a favour. In my opinion, you won?t even go on trial. We?ll make sure of it. You helped us after all. But he died because of it. I almost forgot: it was he who reported you to the Police in F?camp. No ! - Yes he did. When you want to be forgiven a couple of things, you?ve got to help the Police. Fill her up. I?ve got a phone call to make. The phone is in the office, sir. - Thank you. On the double, for God?s sake ! I need that one alive ! Guard her. I have to make a phone call.
