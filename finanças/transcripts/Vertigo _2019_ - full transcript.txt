VERTIGO FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 21, SEASONAL RAIN FRONT STALLING I survived another day. Things shook severely, but I endured. The ground is firm, so I feel secure. Hi, Mom. Are you off work? Yes. Are you eating well? Yes. Is everything okay with you? It's been almost a year since you moved there. How is it? It's comfortable. Of course. You were dying to live away from me. Mom. How's your husband? Who cares? He's the same. It's your bonus month, right? Tell me if you need anything. I'll send more money. He bought a coat just for himself, saying it's cold. He doesn't care about me. My damn life... Why do I always meet selfish bastards? It's late. Go to bed. MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 24 SEASONAL RAIN FRONT RETREATING Seo-young? Sorry, but can you do mine first? I need it by 3 p.m. Yes. Thanks. What's wrong, Seo-young? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. That's our promotional piece for Japan. Seo-young? Lights please? Version 4.0 is almost finished. Just the final meeting is left. I'll go to Yokohama in 2 weeks for that. Hey. What's Jin-soo's tie color today? - You're that curious? - Yes! It's blue, right? We made a bet. I think so. See? Pay up. What did he bring for breakfast? A bagel or a sandwich? - Don't know. - Bagel? I bet it's a bagel. He had sandwiches all last week. You're hopeless. Think Chief Lee will ever notice you two? All the women in the company are his fans. - Yes. - Right? - What about you? - Me? Why like a divorced man? Who cares if he's divorced, he's so hot, right? Right. Why doesn't he date? Isn't he dating in secret? No way. I watch him like a hawk. I have to go. Enjoy your lunch. What? Now, let's have a look. Try not to pick your ears too often, please. Hello. I went into the CEO's office to clear the cups. He says, "Come here, Yedam!" I didn't know what he meant so I just stood there. Then he said he played golf and his shoulder is sore. He asked me to massage him! The asshole thinks I'm his personal secretary? I'm sick of making coffee for him too! I got so mad! Know what I said? What? "Wow, sir!" "How'd you know I'm good at massaging?" So you massaged him? No choice. My contract is up for renewal. Your team has great results. Why worry? Who would think that's because of what I did? I guess you're right. Contract workers like us have no say. So don't work hard on just designing. You have to dance with the boss at company dinners and stuff. No way. I'm taking dance lessons just in case. - Really? - Wanna see? Show me. ♪ We're girls who dream ♪ That's cool. Looking sexy is the key! Why keep watching me? You're so good looking. You know you're popular, right? Really? You know. When will you introduce me? To who? Your son. My son has a girlfriend. Hello, sir. - Hello. - Hi. THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27 SUNNY Excuse me, please. - Hello. - Hi. Thank you. - Have a great day. - Thank you. Check again. It's important. - Install it again? - Yes. All companies at Landmark Tower, your attention please. Exterior window cleaning will begin today. Please don't be startled by workers outside the windows. Please keep the blinds down if needed. Excuse me. Can I have more kimchi? Here it is. More kimchi, please. Thank you. Did you have lunch? Yes. Did you? Who did you eat with? Yedam. But Yedam ate with us. Is it a man? So secretive. Coming to our company picnic? - Can I go? - Of course. Yedam is coming too. Okay. MOM Hello? Seo-young. Yes, Mom. Mary gave birth to 5 puppies today. They all look just like her. It's amazing! She had 2 females and 3 males. Mom? Seeing the puppies struggling to walk... Mom? You called me at this hour for that? Can't I? I have to work tomorrow. Fine then. You didn't transfer the money. I was busy. I'll send it tomorrow. Okay. SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 29 CLOUDY PERIODS I'll be right back. Seo-young. Have some food. Chief Lee? Coffee? I'll clean this first then come back and eat. Okay. - Come quickly. - I will. You all know me. I get mean if we lose to R&D team 2! Put your hands together. When I say team, you say go. Let's win this! Team! Go! Give me the ball! Chief! Nice! When's your business trip? Next, next Monday. I wish I can go. Ever been to Japan? I've never been on a plane. Where do you wanna go the most? Anywhere far away. Opposite side of the earth. Opposite side from here? Should be Argentina. Is it? It must be different from here. Probably. The seasons are the opposite. People drink wine and dance at dinner. Can we go someday? WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 2 SUNNY AND CLEAR Good morning. Gwan-woo! Yes. You know today's work areas, right? It's the north B side sections a, b, c, d. No repairs today, but the pilot lamp on the 45th floor is on overnight and not blinking. Can you check that, please? That's it. Thank you. Chief Park? Stop by security after work? - Sure. - Thank you. This version has dynamic class reloading technology. It's designed to enable real-time input and output reflection when changing programs without restarting the server. Jeez! Any problems with process management? No. We'll provide information at a glance for better management. It's designed to work immediately, and can check statuses of forced termination and execution. We'll add the ability to monitor specific servers and containers. Seo-young? Ms. Shin! Seo-young? Yes? What's with him? My dizzy spells are getting worse. I hear a strange noise inside my ear. And I feel suffocated like I'm Inside a vacuum. Isn't that Chief Lee? How could you do this to me? Calm down. Calm down, my ass! Forget it. Get lost, you coward. What? Wait! Gwanie! Come here. Dad's calling you. Let's go. Hello 'Big Pie'. Thanks for joining. 'Big Seed' asked about the different breast sizes. I'll explain it simply. Watch carefully. The sizes are AA, A, B, C, D, and above. Gina? Me? What? You want to see my nipples? Not for free. You men are crazy tonight. The phone you're calling is off... THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4 CLOUDY How about lunch? I'm meeting a client for lunch. I gotta work overnight. I'll text you later. AUTUMN, THE SEASON OF READING - R&D team meeting! - Yes. We can finish it by this month or as late as mid next month. Seo-young? - Finish the test build by tomorrow? - Yes. YOU LEFT YOUR BOOK. TAKE THIS FOR HEADACHES. It's crazy! Who is this? Who do you think? What's with the smile? Finished yet? Lots to do. Go home first. Please watch the gap between the platform and the train. FRIDAY, OCTOBER 5 STRONG WINDS, AFTERNOON SHOWERS - Yokohama team? - Yes, sir. Good work. We got great client feedbacks. The marketing director said he'll buy the next version too. Chief Lee worked the hardest. If he didn't go to Japan to fix the problem for a month, this project would've flopped. You always stayed the latest to work on it and did the delivery alone. The project is not over yet. I have a follow-up meeting in Japan next week. And I don't always stay late and just work. Chief! Here, sir. It's too bad you have to go to Japan over Thanksgiving. I don't have family. It's okay. Take care, sir. Bye, sir. Go! I'll head in. Chief Lee? How about a game of pool, sir? I have work to do at the office. Just one game, please? Please, sir? Just one, then! Bye! Goodnight! Take care, sir. We're going for some Highball. Wanna come? I feel queasy from too much dancing. - Come with us. - I'll see you later. - Have fun. - Come on. - Take care. - I'll call you. Bye. Where to for round 2? - The dried pollack bar. - Sure. Let's go! Wait up! I'd better turn in. Come on. Let's grab a drink. I forgot to feed my dog. - Your dad's home. - Enjoy your Thanksgiving. Take care! Gwan-woo! Wait! Got home safely? I'm at Vertigo. Can you come for just a bit? Please? Not tonight. Just go home. But you're going away on your trip. I miss you. Jin-soo... Are you avoiding me these days? Don't do this to me. I'm not. I'm just busy with work. Let's talk after my business trip. Just go home. I'll wait here. No, don't. Excuse me? Hello! Are you alone? What did you say? JIN-SOO Did you come alone? I'm Malcolm. What's your name? Bitch. Bitch? I love bitches. Wanna go someplace nice with me for drinks, bitch? What the fuck! Son of a bitch! Are you okay? I'm so sorry. Just forget it, man. I'm sorry. Forgive me. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. - Forget it! - I'm sorry. Just get lost, asshole! TUESDAY, OCTOBER 9 SUNNY, THANKSGIVING Mom? Hi, Seo-young. Having fun on Thanksgiving? Of course. His kids came over and we went out for dinner. We sailed on a boat and had some drinks too. The fireworks over the bridge was amazing. Ate well over Thanksgiving? Yes, I did. Sorry I couldn't go for Thanksgiving. It's okay. We can meet anytime. Full house! Oh shit! I'd better go. Eat well! MONDAY, OCTOBER 15 SUNNY I have one last announcement. The tech lab on the 39th floor had an expensive router stolen yesterday. There have been many thefts in this building recently. So the maintenance will collect all the CCTV files and... Excuse me. They'll collect all the CCTV files and scour through them. There's nothing expensive in our company. But please be careful with your belongings when you're away. Damage to your auditory nerves can cause equilibrium problems. Take medication and tinnitus retraining therapy. Let's also try wearing hearing aids. Hearing aids? You can't wear these in the office. Why? We're up for our contract renewals. Who'd like it if you wear them? What does not hearing well have to do with designing? They'll nitpick at anything to not renew your contract. Just don't wear them, okay? Wait please! Thank you. Thank you. We almost missed it. I know. Let's go. - Aren't you eating? - I ate already. TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16 SCATTERED SHOWERS SEO GWAN-SOON Gwan-woo? What? You're out on vacation? Just for one night. You should've told me. Did you see Dad? I came to see you, sister. For what? It's your birthday. Here. - You... - Take it. - You went to the store? - Yup. You make money like this? Yes. I have a lot of fans. Dad doesn't know, right? I'm saving up to start a café. I found a spot for it. What about you? What will you do after military duty? I don't know. Take your time. You can work in my café and think about it slowly. Let's take a picture. A picture? Scoot over. Ready? Got the cake? Like this? One, two, three! THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18 PARTLY CLOUDY What will you do, Seo-young? About what, sir? Renewing your contract. Do you want to keep working here? Yes, of course, sir. Isn't your home in Busan? My mom lives there. But I want to stay here now. Found someone nice here or something? We're still evaluating your contract renewal. But I put in a good word for you. Let's see how it goes. Thank you. I'll work hard, chief. Great. I can't lose the one spot for a designer to team 2. One spot, sir? The company decided to keep just one contract designer this time. Go back to work. Hi, Seo-young. You had a long talk with Chief Kwon. Did he say he likes you? That's crazy. He had problems with hitting on contract workers before. He came on to me too, that bastard. He's crazy. So be careful. Don't say yes to everything. I'm practically your mom. MONDAY, OCTOBER 22 TYPHOON ADVISORY - Let's go for lunch. - Sure. Ye-dam, I’d better go. Why? Feel sick again? - He's quitting? - Why so suddenly? He was yelled at earlier. CHIEF LEE JIN-SOO HAS RESIGNED AS OF OCTOBER 22nd, 2018 FOR PERSONAL REASONS Chief Lee was the one caught on CCTV? Chief Kwon has the files from security. I had no idea that decent man was like that. He had sex here late at night? With who? It's a shocker. Some woman in our company? - It's a man. - What? - I don't believe it. - It's true. Why me? Why did it... have to be me? Mom? I can't live with that man. I ran out after a fight, and forgot my phone. I have nowhere else to go. I'll stay for a few days. Maybe he'll appreciate me if I'm gone. Thinking of him suffering, makes me feel good! Goodnight. It's been a while. Aren't you glad to see me? FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26 EXTREME FINE DUST POLLUTION - What will you buy for lunch? - What do you want? - Grilled pork? - For lunch? Okay. - Let's go to the lounge. - Okay. Watch it! Concentrate! I'm sorry. Can we sit with you? We're done eating. What's with them? Be careful, pal. Your mind is wandering these days. What if you fall? Wanna leave your father alone? - I'll be careful. - Let him eat. Have a drink. Ever talk to Dad? Crazy? Why would I? Do you talk to him? I don't even know his number. Even if he calls, don't meet him! Got that? Damn asshole. Probably ruining some bitch's life somewhere. No, what bitch would date him? Why isn't the old loser turning up dead in a ditch? Stop it. Stop what? You're still taking his side? After what he did to you? What bastard hits his daughter and ruptures her eardrum? He ruined your life and mine! Don't you know? What would you have done without him? What? You need someone to blame for your miserable life, and he's it! How dare you say that to me? Can't I say what I want to? Stop blaming others and live your life, please! How can you talk just like your father? After how I raised you, this is the thanks I get? Mom. Let's stop seeing each other. Ungrateful bitch. Fine. Good luck living alone. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2 HIGH UV WARNING What are you doing? We have a meeting. Coming. Seo-young? What are you doing? What's wrong? Seo-young! MONDAY, NOVEMBER 5 CLOUDY Mr. Seo Gwan-woo? Why did you enter the office on the 42nd floor? Why'd you do that? I warned you many times not to snoop in the offices. Gwan-woo? Tell the truth. It you don't, I can charge you. What do you mean? He didn't steal anything or assault someone! Charge him with what! - Trespassing and interference! - What? Just because... I was curious. What? This guy's crazy! Let go of me! My contract is over. Why? I don't get it. What do I tell my mom? No one cares about me. I don't need you either. No luck with a husband, no luck with kids. Are you drunk again? So what if I am? Do I embarrass you? You never poured me a drink! Did you fight with him? I can't live, Seo-young. What now? He won't give me money for pills even if I'm sick. I can't just die. Are you sick again? I have no one to lean on. No place to rest comfortably. Of course I'm sick. My life is meaningless! Looking back, all I had were worthless ties. You should be careful of men. That's why my life turned out like this! Have some herbal medicine. I don't have money for that. I'll send money. Okay. Sleep tight. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9 HIGH TIDE WARNING He fell from the 25th floor? He was a contract cleaner who got fired. CHEER UP Gina will sing now. Just one more drink, then I'll sing. ♪ I sometimes dream of ♪ ♪ a world where I'm alone ♪ SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 10 SUNNY AND BRIGHT - Chief? - Hmm? Why on a weekend? I came to work, too. Keep working. Don't fool around when you go down. Safety first! Got it? Don't worry. I'm all set. Good. Fix the lamp on the 40th floor, then come up. Don't peek into the offices. Yes, sir. - Go on. - Yes, sir. Seo-young. Working hard? Even out on a weekend. I guess. You're more daring than you look. Pardon? Still dating Chief Lee Jin-soo? Surprised? Why? I know everything. I don't understand... You can't hide from cameras. Chief Lee is something. Doing it with a woman and a man. I'd better go. Let's keep it our little secret. Don't do this. I didn't do anything. Don't sexually harass me. Sexually harass you? That's a laugh. So you'll report me? If you let me go, I'll pretend nothing happened. Are you threatening me? You want to be humiliated? You want to get fired? Why you! Crazy bitch! Stay back! What the fuck! You bitch! What the fuck did I do! Gwan-woo! What's wrong? Answer me, man! Wanna get yourself killed! Fuck! Wanna die like your sister? Pull yourself together! Gwan-woo. Gwan-woo. Take me down below. You've been watching me, right? Yes. Please take me down. Open your eyes. It's okay. It's not scary at all. Open your eyes. Isn't it beautiful? Don't worry.
