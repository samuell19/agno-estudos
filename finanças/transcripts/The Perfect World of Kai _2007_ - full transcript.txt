Was I just hearing things? {\fad(1946,900)\pos(560,153)}Piano no Mori {\fad(1946,900)\pos(611,682)} The Piano Forest Today, I'd like to introduce you all to a new friend. Amamiya Shuuhei-kun. Now, Amamiya-kun, will you introduce yourself for us? Yes, ma'am. I'm Amamiya Shuuhei, and I came here from Tokyo. My special skill is that I've been learning to play the piano since I was four years old. My dream is to become a pianist. Everyone! Quiet down! "Plays the piano," he said. Even though he's a guy. That's right. A transfer student shouldn't stand out. If he stands out... Amamiya Shuuhei-kun. W-What is it? Do you know about the piano in the forest? The piano in the forest? You know there's a huge forest near the school, don't you? Oh, that forest. There's been a broken piano in that forest for a long time. Of course, since it's broken, you can't get any sound out of it. However, when night falls, for some reason that piano... Tum! Tum! All on its own, the piano goes tum, tum! A dead man's body was found nearby. Rumor says his spirit appears every night and plays that piano. Amamiya-kun, there's a challenge to test your courage. Go into the forest and play the ghost piano. Huh? Th-That's impossible. I can't play a broken piano. Of course you can play it! After all, you've been playing the piano since you were four years old. Yeah, this is what happens to you when you stand out. Understand, this is an initiation. An initiation to prove whether you're really a man or not. Either you go and play the ghost piano in the forest... Or else you'll have to show us your penis.{PERVERT!!!!} It's gotta be one or the other. There it is. Kinpira's "Show me your penis." This is just a simple test of courage. You can't refuse. Even if it doesn't make a sound, you can still say that you played it. It won't make a sound anyway. Right, right! It's a piano, so it produces sound. Amamiya, don't worry. You can get sound from that piano. Stop making stuff up, Kai! When I did my test of courage, I couldn't get any sound out of it. Well, that's because you were shaking in your boots the entire time, Kinpira. You were too scared to play the piano. Maybe you should have to show it to everyone. Your itty bitty... I'll kill you! ...penis! How dare you say that! Ouch! You lying bastard! Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! {Scene time?} That piano... can't make a sound! It's not a lie! It's my piano, so I know for sure! Your piano?! Tell me, Kai. How can a poor family like yours afford to buy a piano? Oh, I get it. You stole it. I forgot that your entire neighborhood is filled with thieves. Or maybe one of your mother's clients bought it for her? Tell me the answer, Kai! Someone threw it out, so I took it. I'll tell you something, Kinpira. I have lots of things you can't buy with money. For example: a giant penis! Stop saying shit to make fun of me! You should shut your own trap! Your breath reeks because your brains are all rotten! You bastard! Get him, get him! Do it! What's going on? Finish cleaning up and go home. "Mr. Funeral" is here! Do you have something to say? W-What should I do? I want to go home, but my legs aren't responding. If you don't, then head home. Um, is the legend about the piano in the forest really true? The story about the piano in the forest is a lie. It was just made up. It's like one of those "Seven Wonders of the School". I-I see.

How many times do I have to tell you? If you get into one more fight... I won't listen to what a liar has to say! "A liar?" Even if the piano in the forest is broken, it can still produce sound. Because it's my piano! Your piano? Don't talk like you know everything! Especially when you're wrong. Amamiya! Um, you're lchinose-kun, right? Just call me Kai. Say, Amamiya, do you want to go now and see for yourself that the piano in the forest can produce sound? Huh? Now? Yeah. Come on! H-Hold on. Wait up, Kai-kun! You're slow, Amamiya! You run slow, don't you? Kai-kun, why did you save me back there? Save you? You know, when we were cleaning. You play the piano, don't you? Yeah. I do too. You do too? That's why I'm really glad now! Let's go! Wait a second! I can't afford to injure my hands. These should do. But are we really going to be able to find the piano inside this huge forest? We'll find it! I go there every day. Even with my eyes closed... Amamiya, you must be my good luck charm. Look! The piano's in a good mood today as well. I-It's a piano. This is the piano in the forest? I can't believe it'd be here. It's so beautiful. It's like it's on a stage! It's the first time I've ever seen anything like it. It's even more beautiful at night. Okay, Kai-kun, I'm gonna play it. You can be my witness. So it really is broken. There's no sound. That's not true. It makes sound! But listen. Try and play harder. Let me show you. It has never made no sounds. Not even once. See? Wh-Why? Why did it make a sound? How did you get it to produce sound? Tell me, Kai-kun! I don't know. Since it's my piano, maybe it only opens up its heart to me. I suppose it must need some special style of playing. Kai-kun, will you play a piece of music for me? Then maybe I can figure something out. Guess I have to. Kai-kun... Amazing! That was amazing, Kai-kun! I don't know how else to say it, but that was amazing! D-Don't be silly! You're so dramatic. I'm serious! Not only am I surprised that you can get sound out of it, but you can really play! You're making me feel uncomfortable. That's the first time I've played for another person. There's no reason to feel uncomfortable. You could play for anyone without embarrassment. Hey, who are you taking lessons from? Lessons? I've never taken lessons. Not even once? It's just like Kinpira said: My family is poor. I'm not cut out for formal lessons, anyway. K-Kai-kun. If it's okay, will you come and play my family's piano? Huh? Your family's piano? Oh, I see! You have a piano inside your house! It's in the lesson room. It's a grand piano too. Wow! You have a lesson room in your house?! Amamiya, your piano is awesome! Eeek! Kai-kun... I can move my fingers incredibly quickly. It's like I'm under a spell. K-Kai-kun, you need to play softer, like you usually do. Huh? I always play this way. What the heck happened to Kai-kun? Kai-kun, I get it. This time try playing a bit more slowly. Slowly? Yes, that's it, Kai-kun! Just like that... Don't let your mind drift. There you go. You can play just fine when you try. This is kinda tiring and it's no fun. But Kai-kun, practice isn't supposed to be fun. But playing the piano is just for fun! Don't you have fun when you play? It's not just for fun. If I can't handle the pain of practicing, I won't become a pianist. Okay, now try and play something that way. Ajino is just like that too. He won't let us have any fun during music class. That's because Ajino-sensei isn't teaching music just for fun either. Ajino? Hello. Shuuhei-san, is this your friend? Yeah, lchinose Kai-kun. Hello. I'm Shuuhei's mother. You play the piano too, lchinose-kun? Not really, I just play for fun. It's too difficult to learn to play the piano properly. Don't worry, Kai-kun. When you get used to practicing, you learn quickly. Say, did you say "Ajino-sensei" earlier? Yeah, he's the music teacher. He's a very scary teacher though. His name wouldn't be Ajino Sousuke, would it? Yeah, that's it. But we all secretly call him Ajino Soushiki. {\pos(564,60)}Pun on last name = funeral.

A pianist? {\frz14.5\fs51\t(\fs68)\move(24,56,-122,-20)}Genius Pianist Ajino Sousuke won the All-Japan competition while he was in college. And he had a spectacular debut as a pianist at the same time as he graduated college. Being able to accomplish all that was nothing short of a miracle. Did you know this, Kai-kun? I had no idea. This all happened over twenty years ago. But I've never seen Ajino play the piano. He had an unfortunate accident five years after his professional debut. He severely injured his left hand, so he was forced to retire from being a pianist. I can't believe he'd be teaching music to an elementary school. {\fad(0,2000)\1a&H45&\fs56\t(\fs63)\frz16\move(188,168,116,132)}Ajino Sousuke {\fad(0,2000)\an9\1a&H35&\bord0\be1\fs56\t(\fs64)\frz16\move(804,-13,830,-73)\c&H272720&}...accident {\fad(0,2500)\1a&H00&\bord2\shad3\4a&H50&\4c&H0B120C&\c&HD8DFD8&}Prince of Tragedy Are you seriously going to have Ajino-sensei be my piano tutor?

I'm no longer the pianist I once was. Please go now. I apologize for such a strange request. Let's go, Mother. Oh, Sensei... The piano in the forest is broken, but it can still produce sound. I thought we had discussed that once already. But it's true. Kai-kun is the only one who can make it play. Kai? I'm telling the truth. I saw it with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears. I-I tried my best to get sound out of it, but no matter what I did, it wouldn't come out. Even so, Kai-kun was somehow able to get it to play. But what really surprised me was the piano's tone. How can I put this? I've never heard a throbbing reverberation like that before. You should be able to hear it as well. Because it looks like Kai-kun plays that piano every night. Every night? {\1a&H85&\b1\bord0\3a&Hbb&\frx346\fry314\pos(996,216)\frz327\3c&H243C33&}Toilet Kai, hurry and finish or you'll be grumbling when you have to go without dinner. Yes, ma'am.

It looks like you don't understand your position here. Hey, stop that. Rei-chan will be here soon. Shut your mouth! Stay out of this, you old bag! Let go of me, you drunk! Damn you, Kai! You still have work to do! I wonder if lchinose is really out here. If I can, I want to hear that sound again. Wow, it's true. The keys are so heavy. It doesn't make any sound if you just play it normally. They say there's only one like it in the entire world. It's Ajino Sousuke's specially-made piano. {If you listen closely, Ajino's line starts talking half way} {\i1\pos(611,645)}Yes, just as the lettering on it says, that piano was made for me. {Re-time. The line starts late. Ajino starts talking at 21:41:96} Up until the accident, anyway. With our current medical technology, we will not be able to return his left arm to normal. Of course, he should be able to live a normal life. But as for being a pianist... It's a terrible shame. {\bord0\shad2\be1\3a&H20&\1a&H05&\3c&H282C20&\c&H7FA99D&\fs48\1a&H40&\c&H8CB8AD&\pos(172,426)}n General Hospital {\1a&H20&\pos(176,424)}n General Hospital Though it has been two months since his accident, Ajino Sousuke is still not allowing any visitors.

But for some reason, after all that had happened, I felt an urge to see the piano I had given away one more time. Oh yeah, it was here! A really big piano. She was always stripping on top of that piano. Man, that dirty little girl would act like some rich man's daughter. Hey, you, wait just a second! You're looking for that piano, right? Do you know where it is? If that's the one, I heard they abandoned it in the forest behind the cabaret when they knocked it down. Why, back in that accident... Why couldn't I have died? It's been three years since then. And yet I still can't leave that town behind where the piano rests. Even now, it flashes through my mind at times. The unforgettable sound of that piano.

You're amazing, Amamiya! I've never heard such beautiful piano playing before! You can tone down the flattery, Kai-kun. I still have a long way to go. I can't hope to win the competition like this. Competition? Yup. The All-Japan Student Piano Competition is taking place soon. There are many competitions, but this is the most prestigious. They say it's the gateway to becoming a professional pianist. And you're gonna enter that, Amamiya? You really are something. I was just playing the qualifying song. Mozart's Piano Sonata 310. So that was Mozart? What are all those little squiggly things? That's the score, it's like blueprints for the music. If you can read the score, you'll be able to play any piece. Oh yeah! You should learn it too, Kai-kun. It's okay, really! Spare me the studying. But... Oh, that reminds me! That bastard, Ajino, showed up in the forest last night. He just came up and grabbed my arm and starting saying all this crazy stuff. To top it off, he asked if I would play the piano with him! It wasn't funny. Like I'd play the piano with that guy just like that. We're not even friends! He probably meant... He probably meant... that he was offering to teach you piano. That's not funny either. I didn't ask him to do that; who does he think he is? But isn't it great? I asked him to do it, and he declined. Why did you ask Ajino for something like that? Amamiya, you can already play the piano! Just being able to play isn't good enough. For me, it's essential to find a top-caliber mentor. Kai-kun, this is your chance! With an opportunity like this, you've got to try and learn the piano for real! If Ajino-sensei asked something like that, then you must have a talent for the piano! Oh, and you don't need to worry about me. I don't really like Ajino-sensei that much anyway. And even though he refused me... If he promised to teach you, please don't worry about it and let him teach you. D-D-Don't say such stupid things! Just shut up and listen! How dare you tell me what to do? I don't want to be taught by anyone! Amamiya, you're just trying to push Ajino on me, aren't you!? Because you don't want to learn from him yourself! Th-That's not it at all, Kai-kun! Besides, my family doesn't have the money to pay for lessons. I'm sorry, but I'm different from you. But Amamiya, aren't you a little too obsessed over Ajino? Sure, he may have been a great pianist in the past... But now, he's just a cheap music teacher who gets on everyone's bad side. Kai-kun, if you want, I'll teach you to play the piano. Of course, I won't charge you. See, that Mozart piece from before{\fscx200}-{\r} Thank you, Amamiya, but it's fine. I've already memorized it. See ya! Will you play the piano with me?

Kai-kun! lchinose, do you have something to say to me? Sensei, Chopin... Please, teach me how to play Chopin! I can't play the Minute Waltz. I can play everything else just fine, but I can't play Chopin at all. But I definitely want to play it. Please show me how to play it. No problem. I'll show you. But I do have one condition. I-I don't have any money. My condition is that you won't leave until you're able to play it. Not from me and not from playing the piano. Wh-What kind of condition is that?

There's just this one song I can't play. In any case, If it means Ajino-sensei will be your teacher, that's a good thing. No way. He's not going to teach me forever. Fine, fine.

Shut up already! It's different now. It's none of your business. I'm just worried about you... Worried?! Worry about yourself, Amamiya! If your hands are so important, then you'd better protect those weak, girly hands of yours with your life! I understand. That's what I'll do. I'm only going to worry about myself from now on. Hey, tell me, Kai! What's this about a lesson? Shut up! I'm not telling you a damn thing! Mr. Peas-For-Nuts! Why, you... I'll beat you to death! Hey! Stop that fighting! Hey! Kanehira-kun! lchinose-kun! {\be1\bord1\shad4\1a&H50&\4c&H0C140A&\3c&H0C140A&\3a&Hdd&\4a&H50&}Koutama Dormitory Is this is where you live, Ajino? lchinose. The lesson room is this way. It's a prefab room that my landlord built for his daughter to practice playing the piano. It's just being used for storage now, but since it's fully soundproofed, you can practice without worrying. For starters, you need to get used to playing on a normal piano. Okay, lchinose. I'm going to play now, so try and remember the music. Th-That's not a song. It's a practice piece for your fingers. It's a musical scale. Try and play it. Yes, start off slowly. Continue like that. Just try to keep the sound consistent. Keep repeating the same phrase on different scales over and over. It's exercising your fingers. Since it's boring and has no melody, you can keep your feelings out of it. It's very monotonous for you. I can't do this. My head feels funny. Somehow, the keys are starting to look distorted. They're getting all distorted. The keys... What's the matter, lchinose? You can call it quits if you want. Playing the piano for kicks is very fun, but lessons are a lot of work. Amamiya must have done so much of this. {\fad(300,300)}Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart {\fad(300,300)}Piano Sonata No. 8 in A minor, K 310 {\fad(300,300)}First Movement (Allegro maestoso) - Final Stanzas I'm different from Kai-kun. I don't play the piano just for fun. My goal is to become a pianist. I'm different from Kai-kun! Hey, isn't this cute? Where did you buy it? Good morning, Amamiya. I-I'm sorry for saying those horrible things yesterday. Please forgive me. You don't need to apologize, lchinose-kun. I was wrong for meddling with your business. I shouldn't have been so worried about you. I know how difficult lessons are now. That's why you{\fscx200}-{\r} They aren't a big deal if you have a goal in sight. Amamiya... This is so boring. How many more days do I have to keep doing this? I've already pissed off Amamiya. There's a skylight. That's right. I guess the moon comes out wherever you are. All-Japan Student Piano Competition? Yeah. It looks like Amamiya Shuuhei-kun from my class is going to enter it. It's an honor just to appear in it, isn't it? Yes, I suppose. Seeing as he's in my homeroom class, I'm so proud! Well, the scenery is not quite the same, but... This is the forest. And this is the piano in the forest. Huh? The sound is a little different. The piano in the forest was more... Just a little bit more... There we go. Like this... A-Awesome! Faster! Faster! More! More! More! That's enough. Ajino! How long have you been there? That's enough, lchinose. You've passed. I did it! Yes! Yes! Yes! Continue playing like that and try to play the Minute Waltz. Yes! Yes! Yes! B-But you haven't taught me how to play Chopin yet. Just give it a shot. You should be able to play it now. I told you, I won't be able to! Concentrate. It's true. I can really play it. I'm playing Chopin. You don't use your strength to play Chopin. Instead, it requires flexibility and motion control. Once you can play a normal piano, you can play Chopin. I did it! I did it! I did it! I played Chopin! That's great, isn't it? Ajino, we have a deal. I told you. I'm not planning on learning from you for free. Now it's my turn to do something you want. What would you like me to do? Of course, it has to be something that doesn't cost me any money. In that case, I'd like you to enter the All-Japan Student Piano Competition. The qualifying song is Mozart's Köchel 310. W-Wait just a second. You're asking me to enter a piano competition? That's right. A-Are you serious? Of course. I could never imagine myself entering a competition! Only rich boys and girls who've been taking lessons since they were babies enter those competitions. Not gonna do it. I can't grant such a ridiculous request. I see. I'm disappointed but I guess there's nothing I can do. Just give me something more realistic. I'll put my heart into it. There's nothing else I particularly want. H-H-Hold on! What do you mean, nothing? Think harder! There must be something! Cleaning, errands, walking your dog! I can do those things without your assistance. Even if you were to put all your heart into it, I can do the cleaning and stuff just as well as you. Besides, I don't have a dog. Wait! All right. I'm not too happy about it, but I'll enter the competition! Are you sure you're okay with it? If you're reluctant, it would be better to just call it off. Well, I don't have a choice, do I? You don't have any other requests... The qualifier for the competition is in ten days. I'll take care of the registration. I guess I should just bang on the keys and make a fool of myself, huh? I'll be looking forward to that. This can't be happening. Your lesson today starts at five. Don't keep the teacher waiting, okay? I understand. Your grandmother is starting to feel much better, so we'll be leaving here soon. Are you surprised? I'm thinking that we can move back to Tokyo right after the competition. I see. After the competition. With Kai-kun... No, that doesn't matter. I have to focus on the competition! lchinose-kun... lchinose-kun didn't come again? He's playing hooky. I wonder what he's been up to. Kai-kun, are you playing the piano in the forest again? I think fooling around on that would be a lot of fun. But that's right. It's as you said, we live in different worlds. What's wrong, Namie-san? Shuuhei-san... Well, we wanted to keep it a secret from you, but your father arranged for Ajino-sensei to be a judge in the competition. Huh? Sensei? Why? He figured it would be impossible for him to ignore you once he hears your piano playing. He'll never accept that offer. Yeah, I just got a message from your father saying he'd refused. I knew it. And the reason Ajino-sensei gave for turning it down was... He said he's teaching a student who'll be participating in the competition. Since he couldn't be a fair judge, he turned it down. What do you mean? I don't know. But he said that's definitely what Ajino said. Kai-kun... Shuuhei-san, wait right there! If Ajino-sensei has a student, then it has to be Kai-kun! I was wrong about him. {Luurah suggests: I misjudged him. | Change? Keep?} Could Kai-kun be serious enough about the piano that he's going to participate in the competition? What are you gonna do about it, huh? It's your fault, you know. What's all that ruckus about? It looks like they caught some kid. So, what you gonna do, huh? D-Didn't I apologize already? You think an apology is enough? My pants got all dirty because you bumped into me. I'm gonna need ¥100,000 from you to pay the cleaning bill. I-It won't cost ¥100,000 for a stain that small... It will cost you ¥100,000. And you're gonna pay for it right here! I{\fscx200}-{\r} What are you looking at? Huh? I came here to see lchinose Kai-kun! Kai? What do you need Kai for?! What are you doing with my important customer? I wasn't doing anything! We were just messing around. Are you all right? What's with you, Rei-chan? I don't care how broke you are, don't tell me you're taking a brat like this as a client. Don't talk trash. He's Kai's close friend. Kai, your friend is here. Come outside. You're Amamiya Shuuhei-kun, aren't you? Y-Yes! I'm Reiko, Kai's mother. Amamiya! Kai-kun... From here? Yeah, I climb out this window and walk to the piano. Climb? I climb down that tree. Not bad, huh? Kai fell out of that window when he was three years old. Here. Thank you. Um... He fell out of the window? Exactly! We searched all over for him. We thought he might have died. And where do you think this guy was? He was playing on top of that piano. The trees of the forest protected him. And that's when that piano became his toy. Every morning and every night. Whenever he was free. He'd even stay all night sometimes. He was addicted! Don't say I was addicted. I'm just doing as I've been told, learning to play the piano. But to Kai-kun... To Kai-kun, the piano is... You play the piano too, right, Shuu-chan? Kai's told me all about you. He said he made a friend who plays the piano. Stay good friends with Kai, okay? Y-Yes, ma'am. Rei-chan, it's time for work. Get dressed. Okay. Amamiya, let's go outside. You're entering the competition, right? I-I was planning on explaining all that! I don't want you to be upset, so I need to explain the reason why. I'm not upset. The piano was always my opponent when I was a little kid. I had to sacrifice so many things for my lessons. It was my curse to bear, being born into a family with a history of pianists. But there's nothing I can do about it. It's my fate. That's what the piano is for me. I feel like I understand a little bit about what the piano is for you. Amamiya... That's why we can give everything we've got to this competition. Wait, listen to my reasons! I'm not really going to take it all that seriously! I don't care about your reasons. You have to give it your all if you're entering the competition. That's the least you can do for my sake and for the sake of the competition. Promise me you will, okay? Okay. I understand. You won't make it to school tomorrow if you're wandering around at this hour. Say, Ajino... Could you help me be ready to give the competition everything I've got? Of course. That's why I just finished adjusting the sound. This is the score. And this is a recording of it being performed. It's an old tape, so the quality isn't great. But there's no mistaking that it's Mozart's Piano Sonata Köchel 310. Is this from back when you played? Yes. Much better than I can play now. lchinose-kun, go ahead and read the next line. Is lchinose-kun sleeping again? Hey! Wake up, Kai! I told you, wake up! Hey! That's enough. You've gotten pretty good at copying my style. You can tell? Do you enjoy copying others? I just enjoy playing well. Give me back the tape I let you borrow earlier. Don't listen to this anymore! That's an important tape! Don't copy others. Don't play the piano like others. Play your own piano! I want to hear your own Köchel 310. If you don't start playing your own style of music... Mozart is going to come from the grave and say, "Give me back my score!" I can't really tell the difference between my piano playing and someone else's piano playing! I know. But if you truly play your own piano, you'll be able to savor the best feeling imaginable. Just what exactly is my own piano? If you're not going to play your own piano, do you think I can have my score back? He's here already! Shit! So, can you play your own piano? You're gonna embarrass yourself at the concert. You know, maybe you shouldn't enter after all. Each day there are more of you! Screw you all! And so, we've both... made it to the day of the competition. Are you ready? Let's get going. Kai is such a mean kid. He didn't even mention the competition until yesterday! Is that true? Because if I told Rei-chan, she'd be all happy and stuff. See, it's not even something to get all happy about. Why not? I'm so excited that you're gonna be in the competition, Kai! {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\pos(770,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz0.5\1a&H00&\pos(808,708)\b1}All-Japan Student Piano Contest {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(772,182,791,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz0.5\1a&H00&\c&H64666A&&\move(810,708,996,708,0,1192)}All-Japan Student Piano Contest {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(791,182,831,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(831,182,850,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(849,182,904,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(903.5,182,919,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(918,182,958,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(960.5,182,960.5,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(963,182,1030,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz0.5\1a&H00&\c&H64666A&\move(998,708,1114,708)}All-Japan Student Piano Contest {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(1030,182,1079,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(1079.5,182,1128,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz0.5\1a&H00&\c&H64666A&\move(1114,708,1162,708)}All-Japan Student Piano Contest {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(1128,182,1168.5,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz0.5\1a&H00&\c&H64666A&\move(1162,708,1204,708)}All-Japan Student Piano Contest {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(1168.5,182,1198,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz0.5\1a&H0&\c&H64666A&\move(1204,708,1232,708)}All-Japan Student Piano Contest {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(1198,182,1205,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz0.5\1a&H00&\c&H64666A&\move(1232,708,1240,708)}All-Japan Student Piano Contest {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(1205,182,1213,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz0.5\1a&H00&\c&H64666A&\move(1240,708,1254,708)}All-Japan Student Piano Contest {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(1214,182,1214,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(1216,182,1222,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\move(1222,182,1224,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz0.5\1a&H00&\c&H64666A&\move(1254,708,1256,708)}All-Japan Student Piano Contest {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz1.75\1a&H15&\c&H676F82&\pos(1224,182)}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs30\bord0\frx4\fry354\frz0.5\1a&H00&\c&H64666A&\pos(1256,708)}All-Japan Student Piano Contest Only one person is going to make it to the nationals from today's regional competition.

First, Enomoto Rika-san. The qualifying piece is Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 8 in A minor, Köchel 310. His own Mozart? I've been telling him to play the piano in his own style, instead of copying others. He's already got everything he needs. Well, that makes it easy! You should just play like you play the piano in the forest. If that's all I can do, I'll be in trouble. She said it would be easy. Damn it... What now, you little brat? Hey, what's wrong? Are you scared? I'm not scared. I'm crying because I'm disappointed. Because of Amamiya Shuuhei, my plans for winning the regionals and going to the nationals are{\fscx200}-{\r} Don't blame this on Amamiya! I can't believe that Amamiya has to compete against pampered opponents like you! He's gonna be the best in Japan! It's obvious because he's spent his entire life enduring painfully tough lessons to get here! Have you seen them? Have you seen those painful lessons? Well, you can't see them. Well, what about my lessons? Have you seen my lessons? What? How would I have seen them? So you have no idea and yet you say such evil things! E-Evil? I've tried so hard. Geez, I've said too much. Hey, Takako... I don't... I don't want to mess up. I try not to mess up. I play my heart out. Always... I wear myself out. You're not gonna be able to concentrate if you keep thinking such crazy thoughts. I know, but I can't help it! I guess there's nothing I can do. There is one way you can concentrate. Think about the place that calms you down the most. Imagine it. Imagine that you're in that place. The piano's right in front of you. It's just you and the piano. The bathroom. Oh, geez. We're already running low on time. Go ahead but hurry up. No, I mean it's my favorite place, the place that calms me down the most.

I did it. I didn't mess up even once. It was flawless. Shuuhei-san... Kai-kun, I'm sure that... I beat you. I guess I should have worn long pants like Amamiya for this competition. Shorts don't really work. Amamiya Shuuhei's piano playing was flawless, wasn't it? Yeah. But that doesn't matter. Takako, just play the best you can. I know, Wendy. My opponent is inside of me.

Wendy, please save me. Wendy, please save me. Wendy! Wendy... Okay! Takako-sama! I did it. The level of talent is quite high this year. You did it! You were the perfect "potty princess" out there. Yup, perfect. Thank you. You're... You're... the best! Get off me! Sensei, what should I do? It's almost Kai's turn. My heart is pounding... I want to watch him. I really want to watch him, but what if I can't stop my tears? If I can't watch him, what should I do? You understand, lchinose. Your opponent isn't Mozart. You are your own opponent, lchinose. That was #36: Sasaki Maiko-san. Kai-kun... Performing next is... #37: lchinose Kai-kun. Here I go. Kai... Do your best, Wendy. Kai-kun? W-Wendy? Kai? Sh-Shit... S-So we meet again, Mozarts. Shit! Weren't you guys just some ghosts that I originally dreamed up? I'll fight through you all... until I'm the only one left! Kai-kun. Amazing. Wendy's so good. This kid is skilled. Who is he? lchinose... Gah, I'm doing it. I was so worried about Mozart's ghost, that I didn't realize I was just parroting Ajino's damn playing style. Oh, what a shock. It was his final chance, too. We're finally gonna get our score back. He couldn't do it. Give it back, you no-talent kid! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Kai-kun? Kai? You idiot, Wendy! You can't stop! I don't believe it. Why, Kai-kun? You didn't mess up once. If you could play like that until the end... If you could play...

What's this? It's not Mozart. Sensei, this is the piano in the forest. Yes. He's playing the piano inside his own world now. Most likely, he's made us all into trees. And he's turned this hall into the forest. I did it. Kai was so cool! You did it, Wendy! Yes, he did it. Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! I{\fscx200}-{\r\i0} lost. I knew it all along.

How was it, lchinose? The best feeling imaginable, right? Nope, not at all. Don't be so optimistic. Wendy! Takako! Wendy, you were amazing! How did you learn to play the piano like that? Wendy?

It's there! It's there! Shiraishi! Wendy! No way. How could they fail you? There must have been a mistake. Y-Yes! That didn't happen. But... Good luck in the finals. Wendy... Is that true? Yes. Alhough they don't publish the scores, I'm sure you were at the top. That's not what I mean. Kai wasn't chosen as a qualifier? Well, yes, but that's not that surprising. I mean, he just ignored the score and played whatever he felt like. Shuuhei-san! I felt bad for lchinose. You can't give a ranking to his piano style. He doesn't fit within the constructs of the competition. You can't give him some standard ranking. It's unfortunate, but that's the nature of competitions. Kai will be fine. He'll get over it quickly. Kai! You'll catch a cold! It feels so good. It's going to be a letdown for him after he put so much effort into this. lchinose-san. Yes? lchinose... No, Kai. May I introduce Kai to the world? Japan is too small for his piano. So let's show it to the world. I'll take him to the rest of the world with me. Kai-kun... Sensei! Where's Kai-kun? They just went home. I-I see. Congratulations on qualifying. You rarely hear such highly accomplished piano playing. Th-Thank you very much. Sensei! Do you think... Do you think I could play the piano and move people like Kai-kun does? Will I be able to play like that someday? You need to learn to love your own piano more. If you can do that, I'm sure you'll understand. You won't need to compare yourself to anyone. You played the piano well. {\b1\fs20\bord0\1a&H00&\frz327\c&H1E1816&\pos(592,562)\frx350\fry324}56th Central Southern Region {See Duck's report re: Typesetting} {\b1\fs20\bord0\1a&H00&\frz326\c&H1E1816&\frx350\fry322\pos(562,628)}All-Japan Student Piano Contest {\b1\fs20\bord0\1a&H00&\frz327\c&H1E1816&\t(\c&H000000&)\pos(592,562)\frx350\fry324}56th Central Southern Region {\b1\fs20\bord0\1a&H00&\frz326\c&H1E1816&\t(\c&H000000&)\frx350\fry322\pos(562,628)}All-Japan Student Piano Contest Okay, another big round of applause for Amamiya-kun! Now, after those great news, I'm afraid I have to give you some very unfortunate news. It's rather sudden, but Amamiya-kun will be going back to his old elementary school in Tokyo. Now it's your turn, Amamiya-kun. I was only here for a short time, but I will never forget you all. Thank you very much. Well, we'll be going now. Shall we go, Shuuhei-san? Take care, Amamiya-kun. Yes, ma'am. Kai-kun... Mom, go on ahead. I need to talk to Kai-kun. I'm sorry I didn't have the chance to tell you earlier. It's fine. Just make sure you win the finals. Amamiya, promise me that you'll definitely become the best in Japan. If you're not #1, then I'm done with you. But you're the true #1. I actually lost to you. Wh-What's wrong, Amamiya? Okay, I'll promise you that. I can't imagine an opponent better than you. Don't say such stupid things! Amamiya, don't underestimate the finals. I mean, watch out for the potty princess! She's a tough opponent. Okay, I will. I'm gonna be really bored without you. Super bored. Kai-kun... All right, don't forget our promise! The best in Japan! You'd better! Because I'm always going to brag about you! Kai-kun! Amamiya, do your best. Do your best! Do your best! Kai-kun... Thank you. If I had never met you, I'm sure I would have ended up hating the piano.
