Then you are the sole reason for my defeat in this election You just get permission for a piece of News to be headlines - I'll handle him - What news? In broad daylight in Chennai Councilor was hacked to pieces in a gruesome manner 'Before we get tricked in the end not knowing our enemy is with us' 'We should get the enemy on our side to achieve our goal' But the most important factor 'You should identify your enemy' Nothing should be sanctioned in any ward without the knowledge of our party or me - How are you, madam? - I am good Bro, that councilor of #145 is calling me from the morning Bro, how odd Why is he calling you? Anna Sir, I am Vijayaraghavan Councilor of ward #145 Even though I won as an independent candidate I need your support, sir I'm calling to receive your wishes 'For novices like me in politics you are an exemplary hero, sir' I will always depend on your support, sir You are my inspiration 'I wish to be in touch with you always, sir' 'Only you should guide me, sir' 'You will find plenty of people with bad intentions in the places you visit' 'They will try to harm you' 'Do panic or be perturbed by anything' 'Be a good person in the midst of these bad people' 'Because if a villain puts his mind to it he can win the rules of this game' 'But if a good soul puts his heart to it' 'He can defeat even that villain' I am happy to see you all Who are the new councilors here? Your name? Vijayaraghavan 'Ward # 145, sir' You are here for the first time Do you have any faaar-sighted ideas? The amount we intend spending from the councilor's fund Common man should know I don't understand Like how we are aware of our debit and credit in our personal accounts We are notified directly on our mobiles Similarly, in every area the head of the family ...should be notified directly of the sum sanctioned and the expenses I intend connecting all the people with direct message from the bank The accounts should be absolutely transparent and accessible [scornful laughter] Hey! What did you say? Will you announce everything openly? If all of us assembled here show everything openly Doomsday for everyone He is a school kiddo! My dear brother! Are you out of your mind? Sit down Totally bonkers! Sit down All of you be calm, sit down Are you making a joke out of politics? How will you tell the people the amount sanctioned by the Govt and amount spent? It is a complicated process If only you do this, sir, you will become a great achiever You will have a permanent place in our people's hearts forever Try your sweet-talking tactics on someone else, not me If what you say has to fructify we need Mayor's approval Corporation commissioner and Zonal chairman have to approve Phew! It drains me to even list out the officers we have to ask - Sir, this is Kuberan - Greetings, sir Road and Light contractor for wards # 144, 145 and 146 He is Thanikachalam He handles Waste and other matters This is Purushothaman Our water deity! They will be your right hand, left hand, back hand and toe the line, sir I am presuming sir will get what I am implying All gain, no pain Have the cake and eat it too Mr Kuberan There are 5 roads in ward #145 Road to be laid is 600 meter 'Without eroding in any storm and strong enough to last a decade' Actually there should be 42 electricity poles But hard fact, just 27 exist And even in that, 9 don't function You have to collect the trash between 6:00 and 7:00 a.m daily Before the residents leave for work this task should be completed If the wind blows, only the leaves on the trees should rustle - Not trash on the roads - What if a storm hits us? Even if a storm hits us there should be no trash that flies Mr Purushothaman, there should be 4 lorries supplying water every week But you send only 2 lorries I don't know your procedure earlier But I should see 4 lorries per week on the dot Take your time and work out a budget with my requisites Why do we have to work out? We are used to oral accounting 5 lakhs for laying the road, sir We can set aside 4 lakhs for this ward, you and me, sir Then 3 lakhs for police station, corporation, kickbacks Totally we can round it off as Rs 12 lakhs, sir Then bulb account Each costs Rs 42, sir We can show it as Rs 80 We can change 4 bulbs every week claiming we are replacing them 'We need approximately about 2 years, sir' 'We can make around 4 lakhs, sir' 1 load of water is only Rs 1800 As per our contract we can stretch it and sign up as Rs 2500 This accounting will fetch about 12 lakhs We can clinch it for Rs 15 lakhs Sir, waste is in our hands It is what we decide 'We can show existing waste as nonexistent and vice versa too' 'It is just mind over waste matter!' 'Our department differs from theirs, sir' You can easily state a budget I can be flexible I'll give you 30% only for you, sir So Mr Kuberan, only for road Rs 5 lakhs Electricity is 2 lakhs Mr Purushothaman, 1 load is Rs 1200 for you Calculate your account based on this Whatever is extra we can deal officially Waste is not what you or I decide It has to fit into the sum our Govt sanctions There's no room for kickbacks What is left for us, sir? If you spend in a just manner you will be able to see legal profit! Are you trying to be funny, sir? What is this, man? Why is he laying down new rules? We are managing this area for the past 10-15 years with ingenuity There are many middle men in between you and me Do you know our plight if they get tense and rebel? 'Line your pocket well, sir This is the most lucrative area' 'Sanction will be in the blink of an eye' Budget is what I have specified If you can work in this budget, go ahead Otherwise I can manage What do you say? In another week whatever change expect I should see in reality 'TMK' 'Will anna give me a slice like he's giving everyone?' Didn't you win because of me? Then this cake is for me Why have all those who lost gathered here? I'm asking you, good-for-nothing scumbags! Did you properly distribute the pay-off I gave you? Yes, bro, just as you asked me to - Vouch for me - Yes, bro He lost giving half to his men and the rest to the common man The strength of the liar holds good Only till the man in front of him knows the honest to God truth! Once he gets to know He will treat you worse than a two-bit coin I need permission from you I intend closing the councilor's chapter You are not in the position to announce Breaking News Do only what I order you to Do this instead We have lost in 72 wards Of which 9 are Independent candidates Talk to that youngster and ask him to join our Party 'Ward # 145 Development And Planning Survey' 9021 families live here I want to listen to each of their problems and solve them I will open 9021 files Do you want to meet each family? Is this even possible? If each family tells you their problems Not just 5 minutes, even 5 hours won't be enough for you Don't you agree with me, tailor? [stuttering] My dear, did you notice that tuition master's guts? Soooper win, most unexpected I think he will do good for us They are all same rotten apples in the cart What will he achieve? 'Just because he picked up trash for a few days' 'Taught some boys and made them pass' 'You women voted for him' And made him councilor Previous councilor built himself a house stealing our money, so will this chap I am taking a survey of the problems the people in this area are facing If you let me know of any problem in your house or outside I'll try and solve it for you I have enough problems at home, sir - Forget that - Hey! Shut up What do you want? If you share your problem with me My problem is thanks to the earlier councilor just like you If you are straightforward everything will work smoothly But I have no faith you can be honest in the midst of these scumbags Do you want anything changed in this area? Is anyone in your family having health issues? Is your family getting enough income? I manage to make ends meet by selling 'samosas' The boys here get drugged and create a ruckus If I complain to the police they demand a commission from me How will I manage, sir? First change this, sir Who are you to ask me about my domestic issues? My party men are so mad they are ready to kill you - Just go - Sir, that's how he will talk What to do? He lost his job If there is any job opening please take him in, sir '16th Main Road SS Thottam Playground' 'Educational centers' 'Industries' If you want to know the truth I am burning inside My boys should have killed you right then They spared you 'You had a narrow escape' Whatever happened can't be reversed now, but listen to me Just join our Party quietly Big boss Pedha Perumal wishes the same We can work hand in glove towards the same goal You have a bright future You can mint money No, sir I'm happy on my own On your own? That means? - Single - Single, huh? You will die, they will make sure you end up as a corpse If an ex-councilor has the gall to enter an active councilor's office And threaten him Under Section 506/1 and Section 506/2 You can go behind bars Camera Not just the video Even audio is recorded I have never activated all this when I was occupying your seat Our work is such So what is your decision in the end? There is no end I have just begun Shall I convey the same? Include what I intend telling you now also Both school and college students Everyone is into drugs Not only this ward I am well aware only your men supply drugs to all the wards If you set your mind to it this can be stopped To stop this drug trafficking in all the other wards is my request To stop it in my ward My order! Whom are you ordering? How dare you! This is our area We sowed the seeds I will destroy you Come on, I say Sir, you came in barefoot He doesn't enter the office with slippers Such is his devotion to work How did you have the heart to defeat him, wretched fellow! You can walk in with your shoes into this office? If the path you choose is pure Hey! Didn't go to college? I didn't go So what now? First focus on your studies Finish your MBA course I don't want to study What will you do, huh? I want to talk to your father Go and bring him What do you want to talk, huh? Tell me I don't approve of your moves Stop hitting on me Shall I let you go, huh? - Let go - You want me to? If you keep filling pot after pot how will I get my share? You dare raise your hand I'll punch your damn face Akka, I don't have water to wash my child's back after she craps We don't have drinking water and you want water to wash a back! We trusted you and voted for you Will water be supplied to this area or not? Sir, we don't have water to even cook When on earth will we get water? [overlap of angry voices] Poor Thanikachalam! Is he Varuna, God of Rain? 'Blame your mother But bless the rain God' They will always demand more water Look how diligent Purushothaman is He has maintained it so purely What more cleaning do you want? I can see my own handsome face clearly Sir, you can't bear the stink, huh? Before winning the election you promised the sky and the earth You showed survey paper you spoke like a hero, sir Now what? Go away, sir You are no better than them If Guna bro had won, he would've transformed our area into a mini Singapore You promised to change it into a mini Japan and mini Singapore And here we are sinking into deeper gloom All are frauds No difference at all 1 minute, dear What is this, man? Side of the road is 6" and mid road is only 3" Look how the engineer has tricked us Built the road like an arch! He must have had arrears, sir! Poor Kuberan, sir They would have swindled him because he is illiterate, sir Welcome, sir Your auspicious entry has blessed us with rain Chennai city won't have shortage of water at all Sir, you called us urgently it seems?

If I walk across I can talk to my people Hereafter you just stick to ground work in the Party What does that mean, bro? Be just a volunteer Just because you asked us to I sanctioned Vijayaraghavan's 7 schemes 'Now he has 36 new demands' He is teaching me my powers as the mayor We have a kickback rate per demand You asked us to comply to all his pleas Stop the permission of all new Slum Board projects He has tie-ups with NGOs and Corporate companies Corner him with the excuse he is neck-deep in corruption Inform our friends in the Opposition 'Ridicule and insult him' He should know we are his only hope to get him out of this mess Let me wait and watch who will be his savior now! 'Come, my wafer thin do gooder!' [flurry of angry voices] You've pushed everyone too far They are boiling mad at you 'Today, Friday, 10:05 hours' Let the councilors begin this debate by maintaining decorum Hey Vijayaraghava If you think you're a big gun you'll be dead meat, man [overlap of angry voices] Sit down...sit down Silence Sit down...sit down Vijayaraghavan, what is this? It seems you are taking kickbacks using your tie-up with NGOs So many accusations are being flung at you 'Both Parties have complained against you' And you've given a plan for your next project [overlap of angry voices] Silence! Stop it Quiet...all of you What do you think of yourself? Money doesn't grow on trees for the Govt For us to dole out freebies You are playing the fool hand in glove with shady tie-ups We need an enquiry on him We demand an enquiry Silence! Silence!! Before your entry our area was flourishing You are thick as thieves with our people to aid all your fraudulent dealings - Yov! Listen to me while I speak - Sit down...sit down Shall we speak and settle or go in for a battle? Do you want it in here or outside? - Tell me, bro - Why are you glaring, da? You love creating a scene Now give a suitable reply Vijayaraghavan, get up and speak 'O drum, beat your love loud & clear' 'All men are born equal here' 'Happiness will multiply if everyone unites to solidify' 'Can the strong swallow the weak Is that fairplay to the meek?' 30 years ago when you started your Party You claimed to have adopted Tamil poet Bharati's words as your goal Has it changed now? Have you discriminated the poor and the needy? Have all the students been given the same education? SS Thottam My ward Genuine people with good hearts Even if they don't have much they always reach out to help But 70% of the youngsters living there are jobless Students who want to study and come up in life Only because of poverty can't even afford a decent education They don't get proper food They have no water either My predecessors didn't attend to this Why? Due to their inability or insecurity these youngsters will start thinking? Feeling insecure you won't get votes Wanting them to be dependent on your measly bribes during election You have ensured they stay below poverty line Previously in my ward 4348 youngsters had no jobs In this 1 year of being elected as the councilor Only 185 people are yet to be hired That number too will soon reduce Only 15% of the students passed 12th grade previously But now there are no school drop-outs Not even 1 student has failed In my area in the 9021 families Per capita income has increased by 20% In 1 ward, state, district or in our entire nation Even if 1 person is below poverty line It means we haven't progressed What change are you preaching about? 'We are working for our people too Don't brag too much' Survey # 730 Canal flowing alongside North East Kanniamman Kovil street ...to Navalar street has not been dredged for one whole year But funds have been sanctioned 6 times to clean that canal Yov! Someone must have misappropriated So will you blame all of us in toto? You can't bear my blows I'm warning you That canal is parts of ward #53 That councilor is Mr Parandhaman And that is YOU! Ask the common man about your growth Ask your men about my blows! A man who was a tenant before he won this seat Owns 10 bungalows, 2 guest houses after becoming the councilor Plus 2 BMWs, 1 Fortuner and 10 Innova cars Daily 'bata' and food allowances for 30 of his men HOW DID HE EARN TO AFFORD ALL THIS? A councilor whose job is voluntary has to pay 10 million to the Party to get his seat Seat of an MLA whose salary is 1 lakh is bought for 15 crores Member of Parliament 25 crores Total how many millions and billions? We know only too well what they will suck up to after they win! Sorry, hon'ble Mayor I know how much even YOU paid to get the seat you are occupying now Hey! How dare you rattle- THIS IS MY TIME! And you have no rights to stop me Every single time the people make a politician win the election And they are losing their life We have all sinned We have all sinned big time Honorable mayor Betrayal Treachery of the worst kind We should change the system How much money is being sanctioned? Does it reach the people without pilferage? The best service in this world is that of a politician towards his people Whether the Gods take an avatar or not We can save the people if we set our minds to it Change everything This city of Chennai can be changed just like my ward Then the entire nation will change for the better We should make it change Thanks for allowing my words, Honorable mayor Please accept my request towards my ward's development Thank you - Hey - Hon'ble mayor He gave us an impassioned sermon for so long, right? - Yes, mayor - All that must have been recorded - Delete it - Okay, mayor I had corrected and mailed the tender you gave, did you check it? Sir, we have corrected and brought it now Not bad, that was very quick 'Letter of Resignation' - What is this? - Wait, you will get to know Sir...? Yes, we are here I'll give the phone to him Sir, Pedha PerumaL District secretary 'Bro, I asked you to join my party But you turned a deaf ear to my request' 'Actually I like you, thambi' 'But I don't like you being the councilor' 'Best thing for you to do is to sign the resignation letter in front of you' Hey! Don't let anyone inside What, Arulmozhi? I'm getting calls from highest authorities Where did you send your son? He is councilor now it seems, huh? I assigned amateurs to the task of finishing you off for good They left you burning A professional will wait and check the embers by piercing it! I told you right then to assign Aanakatti boys - Amma - Grab him What are you doing? Lend me a hand, nab him [overlap of angry voices] Hold him tight 'Your phone is ringing Pick it up and speak' - Hello? - Listen, machan Sukumar and gang have barged in and are holding your mother captive 'I have no idea what's happening' 'Just sign, my boy' 'It has been ages since I exited all these coercing tactics in politics' 'I have chosen the philosophical path' 'Don't dirty my hands' 'Take a video of your resignation' 'Send it to the Zonal chairman, Mayor and all officials' Sad you were born as a female If you had just toed the line to what we told you to do And simply lined your pocket instead of acting righteous You would be well settled But now no matter how much you struggle, you cannot win! Because you have nothing to brag It is all burnt to cinders Even if you win you will lose one day I won't die without watching your downfall What did you say? You wretched female! 'Just sign over there, sir' [mobile ringing] - Hello? - 'Machan?' How is my mother? Nothing to worry They came, threatened her They told her you had resigned and then they left - Let me talk to amma - Will you call a little later? Okay, I am leaving right away Inform amma I will see her tomorrow morning 'Listen' THEY BROKE YOUR MOTHER'S HAND COME, FACE ME Councilor of your area has resigned Hereafter what we say is law Has your fear vanished, da? Sissy bloody creatures! How did you have the heart to let down the people of our area? My mother "For some weeks in my uterus" "For many months in my dreams" "As a bundle of love and joy" "I carried you within, my boy" They broke her hand Amma "If you swim through your sorrows" All of you, please forgive me I didn't want to let you down Forgive me "Learn to win anew against the 'u' in yoU" I'll fall at your feet and beg forgiveness "To make you realize your dream that boat is life's theme" Bro, you have lost your area! I told you right then As soon as he won, we should have dissected him and pickled him to pieces I asked you permission to pull his intestines out and garland you Now he has filed in nomination for Member of Legislative Assembly Why did you go and harass him? Why the hell did you poke your nose? Don't you know nothing should move without my permission in Chennai city? Dai! I am a hard core politician I know what to do and when from A to Z What do you know about politics? You are after all a rowdy who grasps a rusted bloody knife! Get lost! Won't those who are integrity conscious get the right opportunity, ma? Only miscreants should buy opportunity and situation for a price But those who are upright and honest come what may, even in the worst of times Opportunity will knock at their door of its own accord The opportunity I got is you One day it will fall into place for you too We haven't decided the candidates for 2 more constituencies, sir Tomorrow is the last day for filing in the nomination Pedha Perumal, I handed over Chennai in your hands We should have won 200/200, Pedha Perumal We lost 71 seats Legislative Assembly election is round the corner What is your plan? If we perform well this time it will be our rule once more, sir In Sholinganallur constituency alone the candidate hasn't been finalized We lost there even last time - Important constituency - You are right, sir We can nominate our Palani as candidate for this constituency Our Party doesn't have a good name in that constituency Give me that book Vijayaraghavan 'India's best ward' 'Vijayaraghavan's fort likely to be Sholinganallur' 'Best ward councilor' If we need to win here he shouldn't contest According to our I.T Wing analysis this chap has a good track record Sir, just like you said, we can win for sure if he doesn't contest We are already at loggerheads with him We have forced him to resign from his councilor's post Look, Perumal He should not contest That's your responsibility I forced you to resign your councilor seat Now you are contesting to become an MLA Decisions are of course subject to change anyway You can enjoy both sunrise and sunset An apartment in Adyar 60 million For you A guest house in ECR for you to relax Worth 100 million 30 million in cash A small gift for your bright future Withdraw, Vijayaraghavan I know, Vijayaraghavan Integrity and honesty flow in your blood and genes If this continues, you may have to watch your blood spill quite often Being straightforward is a severe crime If being straightforward is a crime I will keep committing that crime repeatedly Your integrity and honesty will spill and kill you, Vijayaraghavan Withdraw your nomination paper I have many murders to my credit, Vijayaraghavan You have no other option If you refuse, you, this girl and your mother who is already half burnt I will destroy all three of you in the next 10 seconds Sign this goddamn paper and get out of politics Won't you listen to your elder brother?

You won't die I've pierced you without touching your liver This is a promotion for you to become an MLA He claimed I don't know politics, I am a rowdy and derided me They forget politicians emerge only because of rowdies! I will go to jail You get ready to occupy your seat of power All the best, bro Tuition master was stabbed it seems Someone stabbed my tuition master, ma - Why? - Someone stabbed our master He is contesting in the MLA election That's why they stabbed him 'We must vote only for him, okay?' 'Filing of nomination for the Assembly Election ends today' 'In the Chennai Legislative Assembly constituency in Sholinganallur' 'Vijayaraghavan who came to file his nomination...' '...was stabbed by the members of the ruling Party' If he had been left untouched he would've contested for only 1 seat Now he is contesting in 2 constituencies The Press will rip our Party to pieces if you kill him after he wins the election Election time Put the lid on your tactics till the results are announced He will be alive only till the results are announced, sir 'Please don't worry' 'Peaceful and brisk polling is underway in 234 constituencies in Tamil Nadu' 'People are voting with immense enthusiasm' 'Voter turnout is expected to be around 70-75% by the end of this evening' 'Votes polled today will be counted as early as next week' 'And results will be announced' Hey Arunlmozhi Where is your son hiding? I have been ordered to finish off both of you The others may bungle the task So I have come in person [mobile ringing] - Hello - Sir 'In Ambur, Nanguneri where we usually win' 'Election Commission has stopped the counting of votes, sir' When Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly elections are being held today 'Election Commission had stopped vote-counting in Nanguneri & Ambur' 'TMK leader and Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Raja Manickam' ''...is on the way to his Party office' 'Long live our leader!' 'Long live people's leader' Election Commission has stopped the counting of votes in 2 constituencies Do you think it will affect your Party? This is a conspiracy by Opposition and the Central Govt We will definitely win this time too [shouting slogans] 'In Kanchipuram, Dharmapuri, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, we are behind by 13 seats, sir' Sir, statistics show - Equal win to both the Parties - Whaat? Don't give me all these silly excuses I know the legalities too What is the status of the stay order? Will it be cancelled or not? All going on oiled wheels? So far so good But Opposition is leading in 25 constituencies If this trend continues ...their respective candidates will win in those places We estimated a solid win of 130 seats There is a likelihood of a 'hung assembly' If both of us win 115 seats Vote counting has been stopped in 2 constituencies We need the support of the winners of 2 constituencies Only then we can form the Govt We have to bring those candidates to our side for sure Who is that? Vijayaraghavan! "One in a million is he Son of the poor and needy" "Sworn enemy of spies and partisans who divide the nation into factions" "One in a billion Warrior against anger "Sworn enemy of spies and partisans who divide the nation into factions" "He will take steps to change the quality of those below poverty line in reality" "To make you less weary your woes in his heart he will carry" "He will make the vile villains suffer Ensure their heads roll in the gutter" "Born for you, he will make your life cozy Remove the thorns to make your path rosy" "One in a zillion is he" 'Counting of votes has started for the Assembly elections' 'Independent candidate Mr Vijayaraghavan, previously councilor of #145 ward' '...is leading in both his constituencies' 'Both his opponents may even lose their deposit' 'Vijayaraghavan seems to be winning by a thumping majority' 'Both the big parties are struggling to get a majority to set up a Govt' 'Ex-councilor Vijayaraghavan' Sullu's friends, get up Hey! Sit down - Please leave me alone - Sullu, what happened? 'Vijayaraghavan's win is almost certain' 'We have to wait and watch if this victory will change the history of Tamil Nadu' Before we bring him over Opposition may convince him Don't we have one of our spies in their camp? - Check with him - Okay, sir They are trying to contact Vijayaraghavan Sir, already they have tried to reach Vijayaraghavan But he didn't pick their call Media is claiming a probable Hung Assembly, sir Headlines is the Governor may take over Prime minister has been in touch with the Governor Power should neither go to the Governor nor to the Opposition party - Legal department, what are you doing? - They planned and got a stay order We can squash it anyhow 'But they will drag it for a week' How can we wait for a week without being in power? Is Vijayaraghavan leading in both his constituencies? In Shollinganallur and Velachery His win is confirmed, sir - What is it? - We called Vijayaraghavan He didn't pick We are trying 'We will contact him in a while' On one side they have stopped counting of votes in 2 constituencies On the other side, a random dude has won hands down in 2 constituencies We shouldn't lose our power He'll finish off half our men filing all the cases in the world! Give him whatever he asks Go right now 'Clinch the deal with Vijayaraghavan' - Yes, sir 'All these years I sat inside these 4 walls' 'Not because the sun's rays will harm my already burnt skin' 'The pain that hasn't healed more than the pain when they tried to burn me' 'The angst I could not help the people of my village' 'I am still alive and breathing to see you fulfil my wish' I am the treasurer from TMK party speaking Looks like you will win in both your constituencies, congratulations 'We will give you 30C' 'We are fine with cash' Or any bank in any country is fine 'Our party needs your support, okay?' 'Negotiable, we can stretch it to 40C' Okay? 'We will pay you 50C now' As soon as we form the Govt Balance 50 crores, you'll get total 100 crores, okay? Whatever it is text me the numbers He wants us to send him a formal message Pedha Perumal There is some problem between our Party men and him You said that is why he got into politics What was that issue? Our boys pushed him from his seat in college Do you know the seat he is asking for being pushed off that seat? Chief minister's seat! 'If I am CM, then okay' 'Tamil Nadu Munettra Katchi' How can some random chap be CM? - You are our Chief Minister, sir - Let's kill 5 MLAs from the Opposition We will only win in the constituencies where vote counting has been stopped But when we cancel the Stay order And count the votes, we should have the upper hand If it is Governor's rule, the results can be changed in any direction So if we should hold the power in our hands, either 1 week or 10 days It is not important that I am the CM What is important is the rule being in our hands What are you saying, sir? Opposition is handing over CM's post to him it seems We could have offered the same CM post to him He refused our offer, sir Opposition is his target it seems Hey! Stop it! Don't do anything to him Amma Step out, ma 'Vijayaraghava' 'Will you do your amma a huge favor?' - 'What, ma? - You should become a collector' 'Is that a favor, ma?' 'I can surpass your expectations' Your chapter closes today for all the crimes you committed I will destroy you inch by inch hereafter Arrest him He has no authority whatsoever We will retain him as a dummy CM His signature should wield no power He should not hold any approval power either He is like a goat that is trapped in the midst of starving lions 'After we make use of him' You can do what you want with him And his mother belongs to our Party too it seems Instead of News being he is an Independent candidate 'Mother and son have returned to their Parent-party' Pedha Perumal, you know him only too well This can be handled, right? Isn't he a simple man? He looks simple on the surface 'But every time I think of killing him he is climbing up the ladder of success' He is quite 'the beggar' But has an overload of temerity But one in a million Let him come, sir We will deal with him
