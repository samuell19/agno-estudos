Hi there, you've reached Katherine Sherard. Please leave me a message and I'll call you back. Hey Katie, it's Alfred. Listen, I know you can fool my dad, but this is your best friend talking. I know you're not okay. Ahhh, shoot my flight's boarding, I gotta go! But call me, okay? ♫ So don't lose hope ♫ I have a plan for you ♫ A plan for you ♫ In these dark days ♫ You find me ♫ When you seek my face ♫ You'll find me I'm fine.

Oh, you need to click the X right there. - I did that. - No, the other X up there in the corner. - I did that and they keep popping up. - Look at the abs on that guy. - The abs on that girl. - No, no, we're not looking at abs on anybody. Especially you, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. - I like technology! - How is that possible? - Oh it's possible. What, I've got a life. - Okay, lemme just try to fix this for you. Okay lemme click-- Veronica's gonna kill you. - Shut up. Hang on, I know what I can do. Lemme fix this, lemme fix this! I've got this. Okay I fixed it. - So Mary, what's your phone number? - Hey! Hey. - How's it going with your lady love? - I'm wearing her down, I can tell. Mom made these for you. Here's to your mom. Three years with Jesus. - Three years. It wasn't me. - Uh huh. - Hey. - What? - Yeah I hear he's kind of a bad boy. He likes his women a little more, well a little less like a librarian. Plus he's got like a million tattoos. - Nobody can have a millions tattoos. It's physically impossible. - Cousin Freddy's got 97. Yeah, he's transforming himself into a human tiger. Makes everybody call him higer. It's a human tiger mix. And he's going left to right with his tattoos, so he just stopped right in the middle. So one side it's a human and boom, tiger. - Do you need something Penny? - Yeah, yeah, I wanted to remind you about Joe. - Joe? - Ricky's friend Joe. You're supposed to go out on a date with him. That's tonight. - I just don't think that you and I have the same idea for what my type is. - Really think you'll like him. He likes old things. - Old things. - Yeah you know, antiques, old fashion music, dead actors, old things. He's picking you up at seven. Don't wear anything like sweaters. Dress up. Hi. How old are you? - 21, how old are you? - I'm 32. - Oh. Do you... Do you still wanna go out. I mean I'm here and I don't have anything else to do tonight. - Sure. - Great. Oh, my dad wouldn't put gas in my car, do you mind driving. Great. - Thanks. - Fantastic. - So, Penny tells me that you like old things. - Yeah, I love oldies music and classic movies. - Really?! Me too. - Yeah, what are some of your favorites? - Oh you know the standards like Casa Blanca and Gone With The Wind. But my real favorite's, the old black and white screwball comedies like Arsenic and Old Lace, My Man Godfrey, Bringing up Baby. What about you? - I haven't heard of any of those, but I do like let's see, Jurassic Park, Home Alone, and all the Back To the Future movies. Those are some real classics. - I actually saw the third Back To the Future movie in the theaters. - No kidding. I wish I'd been old enough to see that. That would have been awesome. I just downloaded some oldies on my mp3 player last night. You wanna listen? - Oh yeah, sure. ♫ You make me Oh my goodness, I have not heard this song since the summer I babysat the nephew of one of my moms old friends. Oh, what was that little kids name? He was so cute. It was little Joe. Look at the time. You know what, I'm not really even that hungry. - Me either. - Yeah. Yeah let's go home. - Good morning glory. How'd it go? You ready to thank me yet? Okay, so he's a little bit younger than you. - He played me a song that his babysitter used to play for him. - And? - I was the babysitter. - That's not funny. - I didn't think so either. If I had a younger sister, I'd give 'em my blessing. But I don't, it was embarrassing. - You know what, if you actually tried, I bet he could have been the one. - That's what you said about the last four guys. - What was wrong with them?! - Oh I like books, you like books, Match made in heaven! - Do you even understand what it's like to be a man of my caliber in a town like this? - I'm really good at following people and I'm sneaky. - Penny tells me you're kind of reclusive. I like that. - I work at an artificial sweetener packaging plant. Try saying that 20 times fast. - Bethany I tell you what-- Katherine. - Katherine, Katherine. - Fascinating. - It is. - Artificial sweetener packaging plant. Artificial sweetener packaging plant. - Oh! - What's wrong? - The sign says it has burgers seared. The burger is seared in it's own juices. I C apostrophe S. - Artificial sweetener packaging plant. Artificial sweetener packaging plant. Artificial sweetener packaging plant. - I didn't order the chocolate! - That's the contraction, they want the possessive. - I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take a moment. - I'm sorry, I'd like to stay but-- - I ordered the vanilla straw! - I mean I just take one look at you and your health routine hasn't done you a bit of good honey. - It's not right. - Is it too much?! Is it too much to ask?! - You'll probably take another bite of that cookie. - Artificial sweetener packaging plant. Artificial sweetener packaging plant. This coffee house is stupid! And it should be raided. - Artificial sweetener packaging plant. Oh my that's a new record for me! - Lenny, yes, Lenny. Okay it's Ricky's friend they used to work together at the market. He's a really nice guy and he collects things. Like rusty anchors or something. If you give him a chance I swear you'll like him. - Do you ever actually listen to yourself?! - Yes. - No. - You know what Kathy, you just need to lower your standards. - Katherine there's a mess in the bathroom. I need you to clean that up before you go to lunch? - What happened to Ms. Covalt? - Well the janitor and I had a difference of opinion. She's no longer with us. You'll do until I can find someone more appropriate. - Morning ladies. Isn't it a gorgeous day outside? - It is indeed. Fall is my favorite time of the year. - You have another package. - Thank you. - She only likes it because things are dying. - She's getting an awful lot of packages these days. - Probably just the new book orders. - But from internet auctions? - I don't know. - You have certified mail. - I do? - Just sign here. - Hey, this is from my moms old attorney. - I hope it's nothing serious. - Yeah me too. - And hey, just because people say things about you, it doesn't mean that it's true. You just keep letting that little light of yours shine. - Thanks Larry. - Katherine. Hurry up. - Hi. Hello. You seem really busy, so I'm just gonna go sit. - Miss Katherine Sherard! - Still here. - Mr. Maitland will see you now. Please follow me. - Okay. - Mr. Maitland your 2 o'clock is here. - Thank you Mrs. Rockwell. - Hi I'm Katherine. I was here a few minutes early but I don't know that Mrs. Rockwell-- - Actually, would you mind? Yeah. - Sure, I've done it. - That's better. - Like I was saying, my name is Katherine Sherard and I had an appointment for two. I was actually here a few minutes early, but I don't think that Mrs. Rockwell noticed. - Doris, she noticed. She's wonderful with paperwork. Terrible with people. Crazy old woman thinks I don't know she's trying to poison me. - Is this a bad time? - Why does everybody always ask me that? - I don't know. - Miss Sherard, I had to do some research into your life and background just to make sure that you are in good enough standing to accept this responsibility. Financial records, criminal records, general background information. Nothing in any of the reports that I read indicated that what happened was your fault. In fact, I-- - No, no thank you I don't have to read it. I remember the details. Thanks. - Mrs. Rockwell would you send her in please. - Her? - Thank you Mrs. Rockwell, that will be all. Katherine, I'd like you to meet Miss Audrey Adler. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Thanks, you too. - Please if you don't mind. There you go, thank you thank you. That's much better, thank you. Ladies please have a seat. Miss Adler is a young lady with a very special need. - I need a home. - And? - There's no easy way to say this, but she's your sister. - My what? - Your half sister. - I'm an only child. - You share a father not a mother. - I never really knew my father, are you sure? Positive. - I'm sorry, I still don't know how I can help you. I need a home. - But why, where are you parents? Where's your father, where's he? - They died in a car accident two months ago. - Oh, I'm sorry. - It was raining. They were hit by a semi that crossed the line. Mom died instantly and dad died two days later in the hospital. He told me about you before he died. - He told you? - It would appear that you are her closest living relative. - Umm, what about, what about your grandparents? - Mom's parents are dead and dad's parents are 85 and live 500 miles away in a nursing home. I can't live with them. - Audrey will become a ward of the state until her 18th birthday unless she can find a relative to live with. - It's really hot in here. I need a second here to think. You said that you researched me, but what about her. I mean what do we really know about her? I'm really sorry, you seem like you're a very nice girl, but I don't know you. Perhaps we should look into someone else. I just don't think that I'm the best person for this. - Audrey contacted me for help. I suppose I could look-- - Yes, yes, let's do that. Look into it right now. - Please, I'm only 17 years old. I promise, as soon as I turn 18 I'll move out on my own. Even if I had the money to file for emancipation, I need somewhere to stay until it was finalized. Please, please, please, Miss Sherard. I'm appealing to your sense of Christian duty. - No, no, you can't do that. No, you cannot do that. No, the answer is no. I'm really sorry that everybody came here today, but no. No no no. - Please. I'm really not that bad. - I'm sure you're not. - I promise, you'll hardly even notice me. Hey! Answer the phone! - Hello, this is Penny speaking, how can I help you? - Hey Penny it's Katherine. Listen, I gotta take the rest of the day off. It's a family emergency. - But you don't have a family anymore. - That's what I thought. But the girl in my living room doesn't agree. - Veronica, Kathy can't come back into work today. She has diarrhea. - This is going to be a huge mistake. I'm not the right person for this. - Oh Kate just calm down. You've been rattling around in that old house for a long time now. This might be a nice change. - I don't like change. - Try to see this from her perspective. I mean, this is a big change for her too. You don't know her, she doesn't know you. Just be nice, be you. It'll be fine. So how do you like your new crib? - Oh have an idea! How about for the next few days we ask each other a couple of questions. You know, just to help get to know each other. First question. What's your favorite color? - I don't have a favorite color. You have to have a favorite color. No I don't! - Look Katherine, I know this isn't easy for you. But I'm gonna try to do my best to just blend in with the woodwork for the next year. - Look. Don't do that. Don't keep apologizing just for breathing. All you're gonna do is make me feel guilty. It's just going to take me some time to get used to this okay? - Okay. - Okay. Katherine. Katherine. Katherine. - Who's there?! - It's me, Audrey. - What are you doing awake? - It's morning! - No. No it's not. The sun hasn't even gotten up yet. Go back to sleep. - But I'm hungry. - Well then go get something to eat. - You don't have the cereal that I like. - Then eat something else. - You don't have anything else. - Well then go back to sleep. - But I'm hungry. - It's 5:30 in the morning. I'm not going to the grocery at 5:30 in the morning. - But, I'm hungry. - What's your favorite kind of cereal? - Oh no, I'm not playing question game this early. And I don't eat breakfast. - Why not? - Because I'd rather sleep through it. - I'm used to getting up early for school. - I'm not. - What about work? - It's Saturday, I can still go back to sleep. Oh great. - Kathy? Yeah. - What are you doing? - I dropped my contact lens. - You dropped your contact? - I'm good. - And where is it now? - I put it in my eye, I'm good. You put it back in your eye? - What are you doing? Yeah, I put it in my eye. - Sanitation's just really not an issue for you? - No, I'm fine, thank you. - You look terrible. And who's this child? Have you kidnapped someone? - No. - I'm kidding. I work with him. - I'm Ricky, I'm what she says I am. - He's my boyfriend. - I'm sister. - Whoa, family secrets abound. - Care to spill? - Nope. But I guess-- - Why not? - I guess I owe you one for covering for me with Veronica. - Absolutely you do. - How mad was she? - Meh, she'll be all right. Just told her you had explosive diarrhea. - Okay. - Nice. - We gotta run. Gotta go to work. I gotta go, we gotta go. - You said you don't work on Saturdays. - Nope, shh, nope. - It's Saturday. Gotta get an early start. Yup, I'm going in. Bye. Nice to meet you! - Yup, good luck in there. - Diarrhea. - Yeah. - Poor thing. So how's it going? She's a morning person. - There's a lot worse things she can be. - Are you sure about that? - Look, go get the mattress and we'll all go out to eat. My treat. I'd really like to meet her. - Is this still too early? Go ahead. - Who's your favorite movie star? - Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Audrey or Katherine Hepburn. No relation. - That's funny. What's funny? - Well, you said no relation when you were talking about Audrey and Katherine. But look at us, we are relation. We're like Hepburn girls. I think it's funny, that's all. - So Audrey, tell me a little bit more about yourself. - Careful, he's a retired counselor so that could be a loaded question. - There's really not much to say. I play guitar, I listen to old music-- - Old music? Like what? - Well like Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Bobby Darin, The Platters, just old music. - My son Alfred plays the piano. You'd like him a lot. He and Katherine grew up together. Does he still live here? - He did. But a couple of years ago he got a job as a music minister in a very nice church in Chicago. - Our church is nice. - Katherine. - I like penguins. They have a webcam setup and you can watch them on the internet 24 hours a day. They even let you sponsor one. Mines name is Fitzgerald. - Penguins? That's interesting. Are we doing okay over here? - We're fine thank you. - Okay, y'all let me know if you need anything. - It must have been hard for you to leave all your friends behind and come here. - Not really, I didn't exactly have a whole lot of friends at my old school. I was kind of an outsider. - Oh I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm sure you'll make a lot of new friends at this school. - It'd be nice. Do you wanna go with me on Monday to register? - I would, but I have to work. - I'll take her. - Excuse me just a minute. - Did I do something wrong? - No dear you didn't do anything wrong. So, tell me all about Fitzgerald. ♫ I don't wanna be afraid ♫ Hurt by loneliness ♫ And things you say ♫ How many times can you ♫ Be hurt ♫ Before you're broken ♫ And so unsure ♫ So will you lay your weapons down ♫ And turn the wrong inside out ♫ I'm feeling ♫ Down and out ♫ There are things I should cry about ♫ How many times can you be hurt ♫ Before you're broken on the floor ♫ I don't wanna be afraid anymore ♫ If only I were ♫ Unbreakable ♫ Unbreakable - It's for my mom. - Katherine. Katherine. Katherine! So when you were you planning on telling me who that guys was? - What guy? - Please. - You know, he just comes into the library sometimes and occasionally I see him around town. I just think he's handsome that's all. - Have you ever talked to him? - No. - Why not? - I don't know what I would say to him. - How about, hi there, you make my eyes all gooey. - Yes, but if he stays up here he's both safe and perfect. - Yeah, but you don't live your life up here. - Okay, if you gotta know. I don't think that he and I share the same beliefs. - How do you know that if you've never talked to him? - He just looks like we don't. - Don't judge a book by it's cover. - A lot of times those covers are right. - Can you believe this? - Oh, she's right. Men are suave, chameleon like creatures that trick you by complimenting you and wearing down your resistance. And honesty, is that too much to ask for?! - Wow. Whine about how. - She had a really nasty breakup last year. - Like rattlesnakes. Sound charming at first but then they just bite you in the end! - Thanks Merlow, always good to talk to you. True love reigns. That's an angry woman. Hey Kate. - Yeah. - Can you give me driving lessons? - You haven't had any? - Just a learners permit. - Why? - My mom always thought the roads were too dangerous for a young inexperienced driver. - I don't think that I'd be a very good teacher for you. - Oh. - It's just, I'm not comfortable being the one... Wait. What are we doing here again? - Just wait. - So when do you think would be a good age for me to start dating? - Let's do this. Nice parking job, that was awesome. - I love driving! - She loves driving. - I wish you'd pay attention to the road. Parking lot, whatever. She's gonna wreck my car. - All these people around here and you're worried about your car. - Says the guy who doesn't own one. - Ouch. That was really hurtful. You know you're gonna owe her one for this don't you? - Actually, I owe her two. - Whoa. - Yeah. - I never owe her more than one at a time. - Yeah. - I love her, but she scares me. - I know. How did you two happen anyway? - I don't know I was, just selling some carrots at the farmer's market. She walked up and said "Have you had lunch?" And I said, "No." She said, "I'll buy you dinner." I said, "Okay." And the next thing I know she's going around telling all of her friends that we went on a date. And I don't like confrontations so, just went with it. - I understand, that happens. - Can't even sell carrots anymore. I love those carrots. - She's a taker. - Nothing left to give. - I can't find the headache medicine. - That's because you left it in the bathroom sink and it belongs in the kitchen cabinet. - I'm sorry. I forgot. - Is it a bad one? - No, I'll be fine. - Well, it must be nice to eat as much as you do and not gain any weight. - I have a really good metabolism. - Hmm, wait til you're 40. - I can't wait. - Oh hey Larry, I've been trying to get to the post office all day, but I've just been swamped. Would you mind taking this package for me just this once? - Not a problem. - Thanks. - I would ask Katherine but she's busy eating. - It's lunch time. Did you know that frequent headaches are a sign of grief? - You having these headaches? - No. But Audrey is. - Maybe you should just try to talk to her. I don't have much luck with women. Obviously. But I do know this, they just want someone to listen to their problems. And not always try and fix them. How about this, come to my church next Wednesday. I'm sure you'll find some of the speakers very interesting. - That might be fun. - Remember this, what's done in the dark will always come to the light. You enjoy your beautiful day. - All right, let's stick to the plan. I've got the gas, you got the drinks, and Penny, don't talk to them. - Hey Kathy, I wanted to remind you about the Coffee House performance later on. - It's not really my thing. - I wanna go! - Oh, it's your thing. Two favors. - Fine. - And here's your card. - Got your drink. - Oh thank you! - Oh hey I know you. Choir class right? Your name's Audrey. - Mmm hmm. - You have a really great voice. Guys, we gotta go. Why? - Frontier Boys. - Oh Frontier Boys is coming on tonight. - Oh, I'm gonna miss the very beginning. It's the best part. They're really dramatic aren't they? - Everything's an event. Okay let's take it easy! - Come on, I gotta go inside. - If you could go anywhere where would you go? - Savannah Georgia. Why? - My mom's favorite author was Eugenia Price and she wrote this series of books on Savannah. We always made plans to go and life just gets in the way. - You and I could go. - I don't think that's a good idea. - Why not? - I'm just not very fond of driving. - I could drive. - Well, I've never been gone for that long before so who would take care of the cats? - We could always get someone to. - Look, it's not gonna happen okay so just drop it and put all that junk food back you don't need it. Hi. Just the litter. - I meant to tell you earlier I tried out for the school talent show today. - Oh yeah, what'd you sing? - Moon River and Hepburn Girls. I always loved that song. Just like us. - She's singing that song at the talent show. - Oh. - If she's singing that, she's gonna want me to be there. And I can't do that, I can't. - Perhaps it's time you told her the truth. - No no no. I don't know her well enough. - She's family! She'll understand. - She is not family. And I'm not doing it. Oh hey, you're still awake. Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you. - Hey Kate. - Yeah. - When we played the questions game, how come you never ask me any? I always have to be the one to start it. - I don't know. I guess I just figured if you wanted me to know something you'd tell me. - I want you to want to know things about me. - Are we married now? - Stop using humor as a defense mechanism. - I don't know if it's really settled in, but you've been through a lot. - So have you. Your mom died too. - My mom was always coming up with really fun ways to celebrate my birthday. When I turned 16 she arranged this scavenger hunt. All over the yard and the house. And at the end of it, in my room was a big Christmas tree. It had birthday streamers, and candy, and this was hanging on one of the branches. I miss that. I miss her. - Yeah. - What do you miss most? - I miss late night talks with my mom. She was so easy to talk to. So sweet and caring. She didn't have to preach. Her life was a witness. - And your dad? - Dad was a sports fiend. That was how you spent time with him. Was on a Sunday afternoon curled up on the couch watching whatever was in season. And he had this weird sense of humor. You would have liked him. You would have liked both of them. - I'm sure I would have. - Do you wanna see some pictures? - Yeah sure. - This one's one of my favorites. It was when my dad used to work so much trying to kinda end up taking care of everybody. When he was home I'd wanna be right there with him wherever he was. And so my mom would take me to the store and he'd get me a new dress and he would take me out to dinner and a movie. Sorry. I wasn't. I miss them so much. Why did this have to happen? - I don't know. You can't let go yet. - It's okay. - Coffee? - Why do you never remember that I don't drink the stuff. Put it down, I have a problem. Okay. She broke down last night and I am really panicked that I did or said the wrong thing. What did you do when Alfred was upset? What?! What's that look for?! - Are you worried about her or you? - What?! - Well, obviously you're starting to care about her. It must make you feel like that-- - Ah ah! If you start analyzing me I promise, I'm gonna walk right back out of here. - Sorry, habit. My point is be grateful. Get back into life. Open yourself back up again. - I don't know if I can. - Remember this, with great emotion comes great risk. But the risk is worth the reward of the emotion. - How is it possible that you're this brilliant before 9 o'clock in the morning? - A lifetime of coffee drinking my dear. - That's where I've gone wrong. - I almost forgot. I'm having the roof repaired and that must be the handyman. Would you do me a favor and get the door while I change? - What?! - You'll be fine. - Hurry up. - Good morning, Mr. Benjamin home? Are you his daughter? His wife? - I'm his friend. No, no, I'm not that kind of friend. I live over there and I wasn't feeling well. He wasn't feeling well this morning so I came to check on him. So go on in, he's waiting for ya. - Are you okay? - Yes, yes. I'm fine thank you. ♫ Yesterday came around again ♫ I found myself and my carrot stand ♫ And I was so very hungry ♫ And I was so very blue ♫ Walking around thinking my life is over ♫ I see a man and a four leaf clover ♫ And I think to myself ♫ He'll do ♫ Oh what can I do I'm stuck to you ♫ I can't get down I'm upside down ♫ And I go along ♫ If you go along too ♫ What can I do I'm stuck to you ♫ I can't get down I'm upside down ♫ And I'll go along ♫ If you go along too Never owe this woman a favor. I know, lesson learned. ♫ I'll go along ♫ If you go along too - Looking back, I did all of the things that you would expect - Sorry I'm late. a rebellious kid to do. - Glad you could come. - Wine, women, and song. One night at a bar it got a little violent. And I went to jail. While in jail a preacher came through and he told me about Jesus. How He said, "My peace I give unto you." I used to think I was tough. But then I read how Jesus wore my sins. Not just my sins but the sins of the world. And I realize this was the toughest man I was ever gonna come to know. But the story didn't end there. But that I may know that He was given the power to forgive sin here on earth. He rose again. And when He did it gave people like me the hope and the peace that we had searched for all our lives. Right then and there I gave my heart to Jesus. 'Cause only through Him will I ever come to know the Father. Look, I'm a big believer and all things work together for good. So if my simple story helps anyone, then all of this has been for good. - What are you doing?! - Oh hi. I'm looking at the inventory for our our Kentucky authors collection. - Is that your job? The last time I checked that was my job. - No, but one of our patrons asked for this book and it looks like it's missing. - That's impossible. Katherine, I'm sure you've made yet another mistake. - Hey Kathy! You busy? - No, she's not. - Cool. You remember that favor you me? I'm collecting! - Oh. Just don't ask. - Okay. Oh can Riley come over? - Hi Riley. Sure. - Hey. Seatbelts. - Tell her. - Tell me what? - I made it in the talent show. - You did, oh good! Celebratory coffee and tea? - Celebratory car dance? - Excuse me? - Me and my mom used to do it. Whenever something good happened we'd turn on the radio and we dance in the car. ♫ Speak the lovely taste ♫ The words inside your head - I'm not doing that. - Why not? - I don't want to look ridiculous. Look in the mirror. - This was not a choice. - And this isn't either. Car dance. ♫ My heart will not ♫ Sing of your own ♫ How could I have been so By the way, they hired the cutest musician for our accompanist. - And how old is this cute? - I don't know, out of school. But he doesn't look that old. Don't give me that look. I know my career comes first. If he still is cute in the future as he is now. - And what's cute in the futures name? - Sully. - Sully? That's weird. - What do we have here? - You want a drink? - Nope, and neither do you. I might. I even bought the wine. - I can see that. - I kept imagining the scandal it was creating when I walked into the liquor store and said "Give me a bottle of your finest." - And how much did the finest cost you? - $6. - That's some high quality scandal. And it's a screw top, classy. - Don't pour it out just yet. I would like to keep it around in case I decide that alcoholism is the answer. Awe, I wish you hadn't done that. $6 is still $6. - The last thing I need on my hands is a cheap drunk. Besides, even at these prices, you can't afford for alcoholism to be the answer. - That's why I never smoked either, I couldn't afford it. - No, you never started smoking because you don't like it either. - How do you know what I do and don't like? Stop telling me! I am supposed to order you around. Who's the adult here? - I'm beginning to wonder. What's wrong Kate? - Nothing. - So we're adding lying to the list of sins for the evening? - Wine is not a specific sin. Paul says in the Bible that you can take a little bit of red wine for your stomach. So if the Bible says that it's okay-- - You're not taking it for your stomach. You're justifying drinking to solve your problems. - Stop outsmarting me. Leave me alone before I go suck wine out of the drain with a straw. - At least make it a bendy straw, they're more fun. - Fine. My 15 year high school reunion is tonight. - What, why didn't you tell me? I could've helped you pick out something fierce to wear. - I wasn't invited. - What? - I didn't stutter. - Why? - I'd rather not talk about it. - Too bad, you can't threaten to drink wine out of the nasty sink drain with a straw and not expect me to be a little bit concerned. Talk! - I don't want to. - Every time I even bring up the word school you get all weird and stiff and you change the subject. I'm on the honor roll, I'm not an idiot. You obviously have some issues you need to deal with. So deal. - All I wanna say right now is that an incident happened in high school. My best friend ditched me. I left school and I finished by home schooling. End of story. - Oh yes. - Oh, and even though I liked it so much better than public school, in the late 90's homeschooling wasn't really as mainstream as it is today. So you didn't get a lot of scholarships. I didn't have enough money for four years of college so I took six years to get a two year degree. Paying my way through little by little. Then I got a job at the library. I became a social hermit. And every five years I'm reminded of my past when I don't get an invitation to my high school reunion. So, I go out, I get a bottle of wine, and I consider alcoholism. This was one of those nights. Now you have officially been brought up to speed. Happy? - We should go there. We should show them all. - Show them what Audrey?! - What an amazing person you are. - No thank you, you weren't there. - No I wasn't there. But it's got to be better than what I have to deal with. You hold your head up and you keep moving forward. You can't let them define who you are. You are so much better than that. - Please, don't preach and don't compliment me. I'm not in the mood for either one. - Fine, wallow in your misery. I have homework to do anyway. - Fine. - But I don't understand. Why is he trying so hard with a woman who's probably not even interested in love or happiness? - I don't know, must be love. This is gonna end so badly for him. - I don't know, maybe true love will conquer all? - If I thought it was romantic to bring somebody's mother to dinner and a movie, I'd still be in a relationship! Ugh! - Ooh I like her. Maybe not. - He's gonna be a mess tomorrow. He's a mess now. Poor Larry. Oh no, that's her. Haven't you heard of look but don't look? Casual. Oh that's the girl I was telling you about last night. I want to leave! - Why should you leave? You haven't done anything wrong. Hey, can I get you two anything else? - Can I pay you a million dollars to shoot me dead right now? - Uhhh, I have to ask the manager. - Ignore her, she doesn't have a million dollars anyway. She's just experiencing a bit of a crisis. See that girl over there. You're supposed to look but don't look. So they were best friends like a thousand years ago. And now they're not friends anymore, right? - Uh huh. Now this is the first time they've seen each other in a really long time, and she wants to leave, but I think she should go and talk to her. What about you? - You should go talk to her. - What?! - She probably doesn't even remember what happened. People are weird like that. Two years ago I worked at this office downtown. Had an extension and everything. It was awesome. Then tax time came around. Then the bookkeeper noticed that there was a petty cash missing. Everybody knew the bosses nephew did it. But he told the boss it was me, so I was the one that got fired. - Oh that's awful. - Mmm hmm, lost my job, got kicked out of my apartment, moved back in with my parents, and now I'm a waiter. Yeah, so I see this guy at a party a couple months ago right? And he doesn't even remember me. I've been waiting to punch this guy in the face for years. And he didn't even know it was me he got fired. - What did you do? - Well, that's when I realized that I can either be the better person or punch him in the face. Then being a waiter didn't seem so bad. You punched him in the face didn't you? - You better believe I did. You should go talk to her. I'll bet my tip she doesn't even remember what happened. - Okay fine. I won't punch her, but I can't promise that I won't vomit. - Fair enough. So do you like being a waiter? It's not bad. I usually get pretty decent tips. You'll get a good one from Kate. - Yeah I know. She's been here a few times before. She always leaves $10 on a little Bible track. It's kinda neat. - I've seen her do that a lot. - Yeah, most church people just leave the Bible track. Like it's something I can pay my bills with. I just throw them away. - Do you throw away Kate's? No, I actually read hers. She seems like a nice person. Quiet but nice. - You were right. She was really excited to see me and she said missed seeing me at the reunion last night. She couldn't even remember why I left school. - I'm not really an I told you so kind of person but... - My stomach hurts. - Let me get you some ginger ale, on the house. - Thanks. Okay, I'm gonna tell you what happened. First love is a really powerful thing. Mine happened at 17. On our six month anniversary he skipped baseball practice and we went to a movie. Then he talked me into sneaking back here to watch the sunset. Right before the sun went down he handed me this little box and it had the most beautiful ruby ring in it. He said he wanted to marry me when we graduated. When he went to kiss me I turned my head. I don't know why, I guess I was nervous or scared or, I don't know. Then we left. He just put on this little mixed tape of love songs that he made for me and he held my hand. I was so happy. I remember looking down at our hands and then I looked back up and this deer just jumped in front of the car. I hadn't been driving very long so I didn't know what to do. But I swerved to try to miss it and then I over corrected and then we hit a tree. The next thing I remember I was being pulled out of the car by this policeman and all I had were some cuts and bruises and a broken wrist. - What happened to him? - He died on impact. Yeah. His parents were really sweet. They said they knew it was an accident and they didn't press charges. - Could they have? - Yeah. In school. School. They all started playing the if game. If I hadn't been driving. If we hadn't gone to a movie. If he hadn't skipped practice. If... My best friend stopped speaking to me. She had to make a choice socially and she didn't choose me. - Was that the girl-- - The girl at the restaurant. Yeah, that was her. - I'm sorry. - It's okay you didn't know. - What was his name? - His name was Carter, Carter Mullins. ♫ Have mercy on me ♫ Have mercy ♫ Protect me ♫ In the shadow of your wings ♫ I won't be here forever ♫ I won't be here forever ♫ 'Cause I will trust ♫ In your unfailing love ♫ Your faithfulness ♫ Oh and I will trust ♫ In your unfailing love ♫ Your faithfulness ♫ I won't be here forever Where's Audrey? - I sent Ricky with her to the cafeteria. I didn't think it would be a good idea for her to be here right now. So, you were there? - Yeah I was working on his house when it happened. - Mr. Benjamin has had what we call a silent myocardial infarction. Now anybody can have a silent MI but Mr. Benjamin's diabetes probably contributed. - His diabetes, of course. - He has just returned from the cardiac cath lab. Now we've got a stint in for now but first thing in the morning we'll be taking him in for a triple bypass. Mr. Benjamin is not out of the woods yet. We'll know more first thing in the morning. - Can we see him? - No, I think it'd be better to wait til morning. - I wanna stay here. - Kathy, it's not a good idea for you to stay here. Look, I already talked to Veronica and she said we both can have the day off tomorrow. And I called Alfred and he's gonna be here tomorrow afternoon. So the best thing that you can do right now is just go home and get some rest. You look like a wreck. - I can bring you in the morning. It's not a problem, I set my own hours. - Oh. Oh that's good, yeah. That'll be good. - Kate are you all right? Kate? - I'm not trying to kill myself. - I know you're not but if you're trying to wash those clothes you missed a step. - I don't know if I can handle this Audrey. I keep losing people. - No stop. Words are powerful Kate, stop speaking things into existence. - First there was Carter, then my mom, and now Duke. God I know this is all my fault. - How does that count as your fault? - This is my punishment. I didn't go jail for Carter's accident so now this is the kind of stuff that I have to live with. - That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Do you think God is punishing you? - I try to live a solitary life. Not to let anybody in. But it gets so lonely. Please. - No Kate, I'm not going to just sit here and walk away and let you wallow tonight. Look, my parents died too. Do you think that's my fault that I did anything to deserve that? - No, no of course not. - Then how is this any different? - You didn't cause it. I did. - Listen to me. You did not do this. Carter was an accident. Your classmates were cruel and wrong. If Duke dies, which he won't, but if he does, it will be because it's his time. Not because you did anything to cause it. Do you think that when Jesus died for all the sin and all the grief and guilt in the world, that he meant for everybody but you? He loves you so much. This isn't water, this is grief and you're drowning in it. You've got to just let it go do you hear me? Just let it go. - Wait, aren't you supposed to be in school today? - Yeah. - Babe, she can skip school. I mean conformity is the shackles that holds society down. Fight the man! - Babe, now's not a good time. - Be free little bird. Like the eagle. - Babe, shut it. The guy's in a hospital. But your conformity. Society, blah, blah, blah. - I'm a prisoner now. - I'm gonna go see if he's out of surgery yet. - That's probably a good idea. - Yeah. - It's not gonna get any better. - Can I come with you? - No! - Hi, could you tell me if Mr. Gary Benjamin is out of surgery yet? - Have a seat and I'll page his doctor. - I'm performing at my school's talent show next month. You can come if you want. - Really? - Yeah, I have an extra comp ticket. I think I'm gonna go check out the vending machine. Anybody want anything? - Do they have carrot cake? - They have pound cake. I saw that on the way in. Yeah, let's just go ahead and go with her. Give the lovebirds some time alone. - I enjoyed hearing your testimony at church the other day. - Thanks. - You've led a really colorful life. - That's one way of putting it. - Miss Sherard. Yes. - The operation went well. He will remain here in intensive care until tomorrow. Depending on how quickly recovers, we'll release him a few days after that. - How long before he's okay again? - That very much depends on him. Miss Sherard, as doctors, we tend to paint the gloomiest scenario possible. Every person is different. - Can we see him? - I'm not certain he's awake. But you can go spend a few minutes with him. - Thank you doctor. ♫ Everyone has a different idea ♫ Of the perfect life ♫ But no one can agree ♫ With what I chose to be as mine ♫ How can I ♫ Make them see ♫ Maybe it's fear ♫ Maybe it's the unknown ♫ That holds them back ♫ The passion takes the lead ♫ That overcomes every bit of that ♫ How can I make them see ♫ That I can take this ♫ Piece ♫ You said ♫ You'll never make it ♫ But I said ♫ Step back and watch me ♫ 'Cause I will ♫ Make sure that I prove you wrong ♫ This life is ♫ All that I wanted ♫ And most think ♫ That I may have forgotten ♫ That I will ♫ Make sure that I ♫ Prove them wrong ♫ I'll make sure ♫ That I prove them wrong - Duke, I know you couldn't make it to our last Coffee House performance so Ricky, Riley, and I decided to write a song for you.

He says I can go visit whenever I want. - Oh, oh. Do you want me to go with you? - Would you? Yeah sure, when do you want to go? Tomorrow. Tomorrow after church. I need some time to prepare myself. Yeah, I understand. We'll go tomorrow. Are you sure this is the right place? - Mmm hmm. It's pretty isn't it? - Yeah it is, but, that's not your last name. - Adler is my stage name. - What? - When I was 15 I took a stage name. I thought it sounded better. - Audrey, what's wrong with just being you? - It's all over isn't it? I mean their bodies are here but, their spirits are somewhere else entirely. - Yes, but, you help keep their memory alive. - So do you. He was your dad too. Look, I know my dad, our dad wasn't always the best person. There's a lot that he didn't do right, but he's still my dad. And I love him. - Oh. I still remember what I was wearing that day. The scar is a constant reminder that I'm here and he's not. I wish I had let him kiss me. Does that sound selfish to want that memory? - No. I don't think so. - Moments like that don't come around very often. - What if it does? - What? - What if that moment comes around again? Katherine I want you to promise me something. The next time the opportunity arises, I want you to take it. Don't you dare squander another sunset. - I don't see anything like that happening again anytime soon. - But if it does. - If it did, then I promise I won't squander the sunset. - It's kind of funny. Strange is probably a better word actually. What is? - That Carter and my parents are in the same cemetery. That the world, as big as it is, sometimes is actually very small. - Yeah. - Katherine, I need to tell you something. My dad didn't tell me about you. My grandparents told me the story of how he denied you. - How he denied me? - Your mom told him she was pregnant. He couldn't handle it and denied you were his. After they died, my grandparents told me about you and I decided to find you. It wasn't as hard as I thought it was gonna be. Katherine please don't be angry with me. I needed to meet you. - You needed to meet me? You evaded my home. You disrupted my life. All because you needed to meet me?! - I wanted us to be a family. - I don't need a family! - How can you say that? - I was doing just fine until you manipulated me into taking you in. - Manipulated, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that appealing to you Christian duty was considered manipulation! You walk with this gigantic chip on your shoulder and you act like you're better than everyone else! Penny tries to be nice to you, all you do is mock her. Patrick's trying to be nice to you and you act like some kind of spinster martyr. I'm standing here trying to be nice to you and you try to push me away and you tell me you don't want me or you don't need me! One of these days you're gonna get exactly what you want! You are going to be all alone and you'll have nobody to blame for it but yourself! - The keys are in the ignition. Find your way home. - Katherine. - Now! ♫ It's not fair ♫ All that I've done right ♫ Is paying back my sacrifice ♫ And it's not fair ♫ All that they've done wrong ♫ Is given them everything ♫ They'd ever want ♫ And I ♫ I almost lost my way ♫ Almost lost my faith ♫ Almost lost my way ♫ But our father is a good man ♫ He loves his children ♫ He gives us his kingdom ♫ Our father is a good man ♫ He loves his children - Come on Katie, just get in the car. - I don't want to Alfred. - It's not good for you to be in this place right now. Just get in. - Go away! - Please. ♫ I've given you my freedom ♫ And I ♫ I almost lost my Why are you so stubborn? - I can always walk. - Where are you going?! - For a walk! - In a cemetery? - At least these people can't hurt those who care about them. - Audrey told us what happened. - Oh so now all of a sudden the truth just rolled right out of her mouth huh? - She's a wreck Katie. - Good! - Don't you think you're being a little hard on her? - No! Everybody, everybody that I love leaves. - She didn't leave you asked her to leave. You told her to go home. - You left. - Oh is that what this is about? God led me there for a purpose. I needed that time away to learn what it means to completely trust him. But I missed dad. And I missed you. You crazy bird. Don't do this. This isn't who you are. This isn't the girl who I grew up with. If you shut yourself off from all of the bad, you'll end up missing out on some of the good. Remember all the fun we used to have? - Don't do it. - Do you remember making snow angels? Or playing those horrible board games dad always cheated at. Or riding the school bus together. Or fishing in my granddads pond. Remember how you hated worms? You always made me bait your hook. The minute you caught something you'd always just throw it right back in. - Stop it. - Katie you've always been closer to me than any sister. Even though things haven't always been fun or easy, we've always had each other. We've made some great memories. Don't you think Audrey at least deserves that same kind of chance? - I hate you. - I know. Come on let's go home. - Kate, I'm so sorry. - No, I'm sorry. I'm the one that's sorry. - Hey. - Hey, how are you doing? - You look kind of tired. - Audrey and I were up late last night talking. - Oh good. That's good for you. Well I won't keep you. Just wanted to see how you were doing. - Hey Penny? - Yeah. - Do I act like I'm better than you? - Honestly? - Yeah. - You do tend to talk down to me. But that's okay. I mean that's the kind of relationship that we have. I can take it. I'll just dish it right back at ya. You are the Ethel to my Lucille. Hey come on, you're my best friend. Besides Ricky. Who's the Ricky to my Lucille. - I can honestly say that you're the Oscar to my Felix. - Yeah? Sounds catchy. They some characters in a book or something? - No. - Good, I hate books. - Why are you here then? - Veronica was my sponsor. My aunt, she was my aunt. So, does this mean you're gonna come to another one of my Coffee House performances next month? - I would love to. - Cool. All right well. Book master. Master of a thousand books. How many books we got in here anyway? - A lot Penny. More than a thousand? - Yeah. - Well I'll let you get back to your work. - Tell him to be here in about 10 minutes. Okay. Goodbye. - Hello. - Lady Kate. Are you awake? What is this? What would that do to the diabetes that you neglected to tell me about hmm? - You would have nagged. - Absolutely I would have. And maybe if I had you would not be in the shape that you're in right-- What what?! - You're not supposed to upset the patient remember? Your father was a fool to deny you. I love you lady Katie. And I'm proud to consider you mine. - I love you too. - I want you to know that Alfred is in town right now, filing the paperwork to have my will changed. - No, don't talk like that. You're not gonna need a will for a long time. - Maybe not, but when I do, I wanna be sure that you and Audrey are included. - You can't do that. You can't add me. You can't add us to your will. What about Alfred? - It was Alfred's idea. And I agree with him. You've taken great care of me Katie. And when the time comes, I want to be able to take care of the two of you. - No, mmm mmm. No, this is too much. - My mind's made up. And for Audrey's graduation I'm going to give the two of you a vacation. - A vacation? - An all expense paid trip to the east coast. You're finally going to Savannah. There is one condition. You have to drive. - Drive? - Yes, it's time for you to get over this fear and get back into life. - I don't know what to say. - Say yes. This is my gift to you. Accept it and enjoy yourselves. - Okay. I'll do it. Thank you. - I think someone just went back to the back. Would you check that for me? - Okay. Hey. - Hi. Duke, Patrick's here. - Actually I went to your house first. Audrey told me you were over here. - Oh. - Look, it's a lovely day out and I brought my motorcycle. I was wondering if you'd like to go for a ride. - Oh. - I brought an extra helmet. If you're worried about that. - Okay, yes, yes. - Great. Oh what a beautiful view! I've always like this place. - I can see why. - You're awfully fond of Duke aren't you? - Mmm hmm. - So Alfred, he's like a brother. - Oh, no, no. There's never been any. We grew up together. He's like a brother. When I was 17 I was responsible for a car accident that killed a boy I was in love with. - Okay. - Okay. - How can you be responsible for an accident? Either it was an accident or it was your fault. All things work together for good. - Which is just another way of saying everything happens for a reason. - No, it's not like that at all. Everything doesn't happen for a reason in this world. There are terrible tragedies, no reason for them. No plan, no purpose. They just happen. Like when a car crashes with two 17 year old kids in it. God will take the circumstances that arise in your life, good and bad. And He'll make something positive come out of it. Your sister, what's happened to her is bad. But God put you in her life to help her work her way through it. And you, what's happened to you has made you a very sensitive, compassionate, caring person to everyone around you. It's taught you about suffering. But it's made you more attentive to those people who you love. And I would very much like to be one of those people. - There you are. Patrick was looking for you and... Your eyes are gooey. Your eyes are gooey. Patrick was here looking for you and your eyes are gooey. Does this mean that-- - I didn't squander the sunset. Hey Katherine. Hey Audrey are you ready? Yeah. - Are you sure you don't want me to go with you and help you get ready? - No offense Katherine, but you don't really have the most trendy of styles. - I bought a new dress Riley. I picked it out. - Katherine. - Fine. - So I was wondering if after the show if it'd be okay if I ask Sully out to dinner with us? - Sully. Is this mister cute in the future? - Yes. She's totally obsessed. - I don't know. - I'll be 18 in two weeks and a high school graduate. I think he can come to a supervised family dinner. - If you guys are gonna have a fight I'm gonna wait in the car. - I'm really nervous. - Why? - I saw the lineup this morning. There's this girl that goes on right before me. She's an amazing dancer. All I'm doing is singing and I'm not even that good. - Who told you you weren't any good? You know, I wish I could tell you that bullying stops when you get older. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes those mean girls grow up and they become your coworkers or even your boss. The only thing you can change is you. A really smart girl once told me that you can't let other people define who you are. I think you should listen to her. Hey Audrey? - Yeah. - If you see her would you tell my sister it's red. - What is? - My favorite color. - You bet. - Thank you Lauren. Now I would like to introduce Miss Audrey Stivers. ♫ Woke up in black and white today ♫ And the modern world turned ♫ Another way ♫ Where the men ♫ Tipped their hats to me ♫ And lampposts lit the streets ♫ I knew I'd finally found our place ♫ Inside a silver screen ♫ Moon river come back to me ♫ Bring the one you know I love too ♫ Audrey and Katherine strolled ♫ With Gene by the shops ♫ On 42nd street ♫ And they'd wait as I looked for you ♫ 'Cause I knew where you'd be ♫ If every heartbreak ended fine ♫ And every man could sing ♫ Moon river come back to me ♫ Bring the one you ♫ Know I'd love to see - Well here she is. - I'm so proud of you.
