You want me to tell that story? They're gonna make a record of it on video. No, it's fine, it's fine. Everybody wants to know how old couples met and stayed together, go ahead. Okay. She peed on me. Oh, do you have to start the story like that? I thought she peed on me. When he says she, he means Maggie, Maggie, the dog. Yeah, and it bothered you so much, you, you asked me to go dancing immediately. Talk about romance. Uh, woman, we didn't have any time for romance. My leg was soaking wet. - Captain romantic. - Yeah. Well, it worked, didn't it? Yes, it did. And as they say, the rest is history. Oh. Good morning! Melody, my alarm is set for seven. I still have three minutes. I know, I'm sorry. It's just I'm really excited. Are you excited? Yes, I'm, I, I'm very excited. Oh, thank you. Today is a big day. You two are meant to be together and you're gonna finally meet in person. What are you gonna wear? Uh, sweats, Chucks, you know the drill. Sweats? First impressions are everything. Okay, but if this guy's gonna spend the rest of his life with me, shouldn't he know who I am from the get-go? Okay, friend to friend, are you sure you wanna wear sweats to meet the love of your life? Yes, I am. No more guys like my ex, or my ex before him. - Hmm. - Ugh. I'm getting back out there, but in my own way. Fair enough. Hmm. I know you've really been looking forward to this. It's gonna be perfect. Thanks, Mel. Oh, by the way, I used your new loofah, but it was kind of moldy, so I threw it out. Mel, that is a sea sponge. That's what they look like. Cool. Never gets any easier, does it? You're lucky it's your off day today. You just rest up, bud. How bet if I make you some breakfast, all right? - That sound good? - Yeah? Attaboy. Oh, good morning, Dr. Shaw. Good morning. You've got gastroenteritis in room A, skin lumps in B, and kennel cough in C. - Thank you, Tara. - Of course. By the way, you need to leave early today. You've got a meeting with your wedding planner, 4 pm. - Great. - Here’s what we’re gonna do, one more round of diagnostic testing, little blood work, and an abdominal ultrasound, and we will get to the bottom of what's going on with Tiffany here. Okay, Frankie, deep breaths. He's going to love you, probably. Eventually. Frankie, you look just like your picture. Thank you. So how do you motivate yourself and others to accomplish tasks? I'm sorry, what does this have to do with the process? A lot, actually. What's your daily schedule, activities, hobbies? These questions are more intense than my gynecologist's office. Uh, I'm an editor at the Boston Chronicle. I write all the local wedding announcements. I also make anniversary videos for couples. As far as hobbies go, I like anything outdoors with my feet in the grass. And you think you're ready to start a family? Well, my ex had a really large family. He had brothers and sisters and dogs, cats, a parakeet. It was really beautiful, I miss that. So you wanna come sit on the sofa? Hm? Come on! Okay, I will come to you. That's cool. Okay, alone time it is. He didn't even like dogs, not even my sweet Georgie. That's not true. I've always loved dogs. You have not. You just wanted to take me out for a milkshake. Well, that may be true. I did want to take her out for a milkshake. She's gorgeous. You trying to butter me up? The most beautiful girl in the world. You're laying it all pretty thick, Mister. Is it working? Maybe. Hi, Tara, if I can just have you sign here. Oh, ooh. - Sorry. - Signature? Uh, here you go. - Thank you. - Thanks. Um, I also wanted to ask, um, my roommate got a dog recently and needs a vet. Oh, yeah, she should definitely come in for an initial intake checkup. Uh, are you the point of contact or should I get her number? Yeah, you can put me down as the point of contact, yeah. Um, yeah, I'm a lot more obsessive about my calendar. She's a lot more go with the flow. I am the same way with plans. I love a good down-to-the minute plan. A double confirmed plan, the best. Same. This, all-flower wall. It is going to be so posh. 500 meters of pink peonies. This, this whole wall is gonna be flowers? It sounds like it's gonna cost an arm and a- No one likes a buzz kill, Jack. Right. You guys are the experts. I'm sure it's gonna be- So posh. Now tell me, are we still locked on in no bridesmaids, no groomsmen thingy? Locked, I do not need a Pippa Middleton show stealer moment. Oui, oui, oui. What about Boner? Uh, honey, I, I think it's enough that Bonner's invited, don't you? No, Stacy, he's been my best friend for over 20 years. I know, but we can't ask the calligraphy artist to write Boner in the program. Boner's just not posh. Okay, well, his actual name is Travis Bernard. Can we put Travis on there? Whatever you wanna do, babe. Now, let us talk about the table settings. The waterfall napkins will be, So posh. Does it seem like he likes me? I mean, I don't think he really knows what he likes. He's really only been out of the shelter for like four hours. At least you got some sort of response from him. He barked when you got home. All dogs bark at me. I'm a delivery driver. It's basically in their DNA. Okay, listen to this. Walks, tennis balls, and chicken. Like, is he even a real dog? These things take time. Like think about how long it took you to open up to me. That's true. I mean, you say that I communicate too much, but my family group chat is always blowing up. Definitely not my family. I'm lucky if my sister remembers my birthday. Well, you always got me. You're stuck with me. But I do think that maybe you should get back into the dating world a little bit. Maybe Tucker could use a dad. Oh, a dad? Tucker would like a dad. Okay, can we just, you know, take it one day at a time, like, bring it down? Fine. Hey, Stace, I'm sort of, I'm sort of, uh, bummed out about the wedding. I know, it royally sucks throughout of lemon curd. No, no, no, it's not, it's not that. It's actually, um, the, the whole wedding because it's just, it's just becoming so big, you know? And so excessive. What's your idea of a dream wedding, babe? Roll around in the hay with your dog and spit seeds into a barrel? Come on. No. My father is paying for this whole wedding, babe. It's his gift to us, just like that very expensive sports car he gave you. I never asked for that car. But you look hot in that car, and I like being seen in that car with you. I don't wanna sound ungrateful here... Okay, well, you are sounding ungrateful. Okay, let's do it. Big wedding it is. Oh, this has been our plan all along, babe. We've checked so many boxes, right? Junior and senior prom king and queen, check. Engaged on a yacht, check. Now let's check off dream wedding, okay? Okay. Maybe after the wedding, we can start letting, uh, Dakota sleep in here with us. Yeah, your dog is perfectly happy in my mud room. Dogs love mud. Well, it's not, it's not about the mud, honey. It's, you know, about being with, are you... Hi, bud, you're out of the crate. All right, this is good. You wanna come sit on the sofa with me? Good boy. Good boy. Look, I know you don't love walks, think of all the vitamin D, all the butts you can sniff, okay? It's gonna be great, ready? Okay. C’mon. Easy, bud, stop pulling. Tucker! Tucker! ♪ The very thought of you ♪ ♪ And I forget to do ♪ Here we go, there, buddy. There you go, bud, there you go. Hold on, come on. There we go. He got away from you, huh? Uh, yeah. I, I, I just got him and he slipped out of his collar. That's because that car's too big for him. Honestly, until he gets used to walking with you, what you should have him in is a harness because it's better for their necks and it's a heck of a lot safer. Okay, yeah, we will get the harness for sure. Thank you so much for grabbing him. From now on, it Is parks only for this guy. Well, there's a lot more to it than just that. Owning a dog is a pretty big responsibility. Yep, I, I know that. Yeah, I'm actually a dog owner myself and I work with animals, so it's not all fun and games. Copy that, got it. Thank you, sir. Sure, all right. Well, best of luck with him and I'll see you around. Yeah, come, bud. Is it irrational if I start planning my wedding? To the vet receptionist? Yeah. Uh-oh, I guess I'm the irrational one. Are you cool with me still coming to the vet appointment today? Yes, of course. So I was thinking maybe I could bring her like snacks or flowers or something. Mel, slow down. You haven't even been on a proper date with her. Why don't you just start by asking her out? I mean, I met a hot guy in a crosswalk today who saved Tucker's life, but you don't see me asking him out. Whoa, rewind, you met someone? No, no, no, not like that. He saved Tucker and- And he's hot. Yeah, he was hot. So a hot hero. More like a hot weirdo. He started lecturing me on dog safety and etiquette. Real snooze fest. Ugh, gross. Okay, back to me. So I'm thinking no flowers or snacks. I'm just gonna ask her out. Great idea, Mel. Thanks. Woo! Bottoms up. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. To your best man. Absolutely. And Jack, thank you so much for helping Boner prep for his 5K this month. The first thing he taught me was that the K in a 5K does not stand for K. I was a little bummed out about that one. You are going to be fine, hun. Thank you. Hm, Stacy running late? Uh, yeah, yeah, she said she had to get some highlights, so she might be a minute. Oh, yes, she'll be a while. Um, I'm gonna run to the ladies' room. - I'll be right back. - Alright. Ooh, sorry, sweetie. All right, man to man, what are you gonna do? Um... Are you gonna go through with this wedding? I sort of, I sort of have to. I don't really have a choice. What are you talking about? Man, she is taking away your free will. You know you don't have to marry her, right? No, but I kind of do because we've been together forever and it's the right thing to do. The right thing to do? Man, she doesn't like anything you like. She doesn't like animals, she doesn't like outside. And can I be totally honest with you? Weren't you just doing that? I don't even think she likes you. She's, she's marrying me. Yeah, she's marrying you, but she doesn't like you, and you can love someone without liking them, it's just not the type of love you wanna build a life with, bud. Stacy never puts you first, and I know you think you owe her or whatever- Well, look, her and her family have been there for me for a long time. They've helped me out a lot. Okay, so they helped you. Everybody needs help every once in a while. It just seems like it's a lot of guilt and obligation in your house. You and Stacy don't seem to want the same things. So you and Angela have always seen eye to eye? You never had any doubts? Never, not a one. Oh, sorry, the, uh, line for the ladies room was very long. Okay, what did I miss? Nothing. My assistant, she never, never puts it in one text, never. Uh, I got a surgery, guys. - I love you. - Love you back, buddy. All right, see you. Come on, buddy. Now I got two drinks. Guess I'm driving home. Oh, yeah. There you go, buddy. Boy, come on. ♪ The very thought of you ♪ It's you. It's you. Are you following me? Following you? This is, this is my clinic. You guys know each other? This is the guy I was just telling you about, who saved Tucker today. The weirdo! - No, I said hero. - Ah. Well, the, the hero weirdo is your vet. What a coincidence? Hi. Hi. I, um, wanted to ask you something. Anything. - Maybe... - Hey, uh, where's the gauze at? I showed you, in the cabinet, in the drawer labeled gauze. Thanks. Sorry, what were you saying? - Uh, yeah, so I was gonna... - Where are the gloves at? And can you just show me how to use the printer real quick? Yes, Dylan. Um, excuse me. He’s new. I'll be right back as soon as I finish with him, sorry. This is the printer. Yeah, obviously, okay. Thank you for your patience. Yeah, of course. Uh, so how's Tuck? Is he normal? He's perfectly normal, yes. And I see that you got him that harness. Yes, I, I did. Oh, yeah. Uh, do you know how old he is, by chance? I would say he's about two. So is that 14 in human years? Mm-hm. Aw, my little teenage son is becoming a man. Yeah. Well, since everything is all clear with him, I think that we'll just see you back here in six months for a checkup. All right, thank you, doctor. You can call me Jack. Jack. Yeah, and, and you are Frankie, so it's nice to properly meet you, Frankie. It's nice to meet you. Okay. Oh, by the way, um, you know that my dog would not leave Tucker's side the entire time he was getting his blood work done. - Really? - Yeah, and I've never seen him do anything like that before. Okay, they told me at the rescue that Tucker doesn't play well with others, so that, that is surprising. What is your dog's name? Dakota. - Hm. - Yeah. You know, maybe since they get along so well, we should get them together and do a little play date in the park or something. Yeah, I, I could totally meet you at the park - For the dogs. - For the dogs, of course, yeah. - Okay. - Okay. All right, well, I'm gonna get going now. Uh, I actually neutered a pup this morning and he's about to wake up and realize what just happened. Oh, that's ruff. That's, I see what you did there, that's good. Tucker'll be in in a moment. Sounds paw-fect. - Paw-fect? - Oh, okay, two too many? Maybe. Why? Why? You really downplayed how hot Dr. Jack is. I told you he was hot, but you know, I actually think he's like maybe too attractive. I'm sorry, how is that a thing? Ding dong, ding dong! Oh, where are my two favorite ladies? There you are. A little birdy called me and told me that somebody met the one. I'm sure you just had takeout, so I brought dinner and I wanna hear all about it. You called your mother and told her I met the one? I didn't call her. I texted her. I feel, I feel there's something different about you, it's like a seismic energy shift, it really is. What is it? Is it, is it, is it some spice in your sex life? Mom, please stop. You be quiet, you came outta my vagina. You're not allowed a say. Oh my God. Listen, there's something happening. I'm sorry. It's something, it's, it's spicy. It's spicy sex with this guy? - No spice. - No spice. No, I met this guy for like a half a second. - Yeah? - It was perfection. - Yes? - And then it wasn't. Classic, Frankie's running the other direction as soon as she starts to have feelings. Okay, classic Melody. I'm too scared to pull the trigger, so I'm never gonna ask a cute girl from the vet's office out on a real date. Oh, uh-oh, that is not my girl. I raised you better than that. You go after your love. Fine, I will ask her if you ask him, deal? Or how about I have my love life under control? And you know what you can help me with, actually? I'm going to throw a little birthday party for Tucker. Apparently he's turning 14 in human years, which is super cute, so maybe we could throw something intimate. Intimate, I like the sounds of that. Mom, you should come. Oh no, I'm teaching sex ed to the geriatrics at the old folks home, my favorite class. Anyway, I will say this once and I will say it again and again, the only thing standing between you and your happily ever after is, ladies? You! Wait, this class- You're too young. Wait, water break. - What? - Stat. Oh man, it's so hot, ooh. Yeah, well, the full body sweatsuit probably isn't helping. How far did I go? Three quarters of a mile. How close is that to a 5K? - 5K is only three miles. - Only? Hey man, I still need to trim a few lbs for your big day 'cause you know it's gonna be all eyes on the big Boner when I go strutting down that aisle, boy. Yeah, I actually gotta talk to you about that, um- What? Well, Stacy doesn't think I should have a best man. What do you mean? I don't know. It's got something to do with the calligraphy artist, there's something, and them writing things, and too many people standing up there with us. Stacy thinks that- What do you think, Jack? I don't know, Boner. It's time you figured it out. Man, you lucky I'm a chill dude, man. I could go Boner berserk on you right now, like full on best manzilla, but I won't. You can go Boner berserk on me if you want to. Oh man, a true best man stays true to this guy even after losing the title, everybody knows that, but you do gotta let me beat you in that 5K. - Deal. - All right. You okay to run this last leg on your own? I gotta go clear my head. Yeah, go ahead man, I got this. All right, love you, man. Love you back, buddy. Keep running, no sitting! No sitting, I'm not sitting! I have to say, I am surprised he texted me. Really? I said, we gotta get these dogs together for play date. Look at them, they love each other. Yeah, I'm glad him and Dakota are such good friends. They are certainly fast friends. I was actually thinking about getting a second dog, but like I told you before, I mean, Dakota's very picky about the company that he keeps. How long have you had him? Um, since he was about this big. Yeah, I actually found him in a gas station. I was, I was driving up to Maine to go to my best friend Bonner's wedding, and pulling into this gas station, and there he was, this little thing. He had his head buried in this big bag of barbecue chips. - That's cute. - Yeah. Okay, your friend Boner, is that like a legal name? No, it's his preferred nickname. - That's incredible. - It is. He's actually a great guy, but yeah, Dakota's been with me ever since that trip. Hm, he's lucky to have you. Us humans don't always do right by our animal friends. Yeah, I agree. I feel like adopting Tucker was my way of doing my one small part. I don't know if it's a small part. I think it's a pretty big deal to Tucker. I'm hopeful, though. I had the best connection with my ex' dog, I loved him. My ex, not so much. I've never been flat on my face in love before. Flat on your face in love. That sounds so painful. I don't know, I just, I guess I've never really let someone in. That way it doesn't hurt so much when it doesn't work out. That was weird and personal. No, it wasn't weird. That makes perfect sense to me. My assistant just can never put it in one text. It's okay. Hold on. Frankie, I gotta go. I gotta get back to the clinic. Okay. Can we finish this conversation on our next play date? At the next play date. I'll, uh, sext you to set it up. What? Text you, I will text you to set it up. Sounds good. God. Dakota! Can I help you? Is Tara here? I, I have a delivery for her. You just missed her. She left 15 minutes ago, but I, I could, I could sign that for you if you want. Did her schedule change? Ugh, there aren't any paper towels in there. You can use the hand dryer. I won't be sticking these into a tornado of hot germs. - Hey! - Hey, Jackie, babe! What's going on? I told you I wasn't working at the clinic today. Oh, I totally spaced. You have a last minute tux fitting. What? That fitting is today? Yes, ASAP. The tailor needs as much time to snip and sew and make it fit this body just right. Let’s go. Okay, okay. Done, who's next? What the? Tuck, it's me! Ugh, oh, good, you're already sitting. So listen up, the hot doc- He's engaged. Wait, how did you know that? They are my next assignment. Did they send one of those like inspirational videos or something to tell you more about them? No, hang on, let me see. Hi, I'm Stacy Rue, and this is my handsome hunky hubs to be, Dr. Jack Shaw. Hey, there. We met when we were in fifth grade. He gave me a Fruit Roll-Up. What flavor was it honey? It was green apple and it was so good, and we just loved- Okay, you know what? I will finish this later. It's fine. Ugh, I'm devastated for you. You think somebody else at the Chronicle should maybe write this instead? I don’t know. I, I don't know. Why I am feeling any sort of emotion right now. I'm not dating him. My dog is friends with his dog. He is my vet. Doesn't get more platonic than that. We bagged poop together, the end. Yeah, but there were sparks. Well, the sparks were clearly in my head. Your head actually, you are the one who came up with the sparks. I'm good, I have nothing, nothing, no emotion. Completely dead inside, so I'm, I'm cool. I can write this piece professionally, objectively, ugh. Yeah, doesn't really get much worse than this. Except it, it kind of does because I'm scheduled to do an in-person interview with him tomorrow. Yeah, what am I gonna do? What, what, what is that face? Francesca, nice to meet you. Should we put you in a trench coat? No, it's way to Inspector Gadget. Should I really be doing this? Yes, Dr. Jack Shaw or Dr. Jerk Shaw, or whatever, should have been up front with you and told you he was off the market, okay? Be careful who you mess with because I will deliver your packages across the street. Melody, no, that is too far. Fine, the orthodontist's next door. Woo! Ha-ha! Thoughts? Okay. Thank you so much for meeting with us. Yeah, thank you so much. And I love your scarf, so chic. Thank you. Uh, now let us start at the beginning. Uh, tell me your, your love story. Ours is actually really adorable. Jackie here gave me a Fruit Roll-Up in the sixth grade, and it was love ever since. Yeah. Okay, I, I guess I was hoping for more specifics to give the piece some passion. Uh, uh, when did you first know you, you loved each other? Uh... Tell her, sweetie. Okay, uh, where, where are you from exactly? Because, um, because your accent's a little, um- I'm up from Sweden. Sweden? Go on. Okay, well, we, we, well, it was middle school, and we went to, and we went to the movies. We were holding hands in there. Right, that was it, definitely. Uh, wait, was it college? No, no, no, no, 'cause college you were long distance and I was in my sorority social chair. Big responsibility. Stacy's a natural leader. And Jackie, here's a natural follower. That's why we fit just right. Yeah, just right. I basically locked him down as soon as humanly possible. So just, like, say we're soulmates or something, blah, blah, blah. Okie dokie, I'll, I'll fill in some details to the blah, blah, blah. Oh, also, more urgently, can you please be sure to spell the names of the Prescott cousins correctly? They're politicians and oil people, so they're weird about media representation. Yes. Oh, and as far as great aunt Ethel May goes, she's dead, but she has it in her will that she must be mentioned in any published news about the Prescott family. Oh, shoot. I do know you. - No. - Frankie. Yes. Wait, you two know each other? - Yes. - No. -Well, yes- -No, sort of. Um, from the clinic. It's our dogs. Ugh, say no more. Dog people, they're own subculture. Oh my God, apparently the string quartet dropped out. Stand by. Why didn't you tell me you were writing this piece? Why didn't you tell me you're engaged? You didn't even bother to mention you were engaged? No, I didn't forget to mention it. It just didn't come up organically. And, and, and, and why did you show up here, pretend to be somebody else wearing the world's largest hat and sounding like the third Mario brother? Okay, I am the one that works with the newspaper. I will be asking the questions. Okay, well, ask away. I'm an open book. Ha, an open book? Okay, maybe you are an open book, but you have a secret chapter called I'm Engaged. Fair enough, look, I whiffed on that one, all right? But as, as, as dog play date acquaintances who only met up once, did we really owe each other those kind of specifics? Nope, I guess not. Okay, and technically, I barely know you. I mean, we met up, we spent two hours together. Two hours, what's that? In the course of a lifetime, it's nothing. It's like a blip. All I know is if I had a fiance, I definitely would've mentioned that. Okay, well, you know, good for you and your fake fiance. Congratulations, by the way. I'm very happy for you two. Are you actually taking a shot at me for being single? No. I guess I can add smug and condescending to the list of things I know about you, which now include being engaged. I gotta tell you something, Francesca, she's a real snake. Oh, she is a hard-hitting journalist. Jackie, code orange, our cellist has a hernia. We have to go. Okay, all right. Well, thank you so much for your time today, Frank-cesca. Yes, thanks hon, tootles. We'll be in touch. I look forward to it. I can't wait to write about you two love birds. All right, buddy, let's take you off the leash. Go on. - Oh, man. - There he is. I wonder if I'd run fast if I was running towards donuts. Well, a desirable destination is always a good motivator. Hey, you're running every day, that’s the most important thing, It's habit building. Hey, come on man, give me a wedding update, and please tell me it's better. It's better. I'm really in a pickle here, Boner. Why do people say that? I'm in a pickle, I'm really in a pickle. Are you really in a pickle? Just something my grandmother used to say. That's why I say it. No, I totally get that. I've heard her say it a bunch too, but think about it. I mean, a person stuck inside of a pickle. That's terrifying, bro. Can you just let me say what I was gonna say? I'm sorry, that would have to be one huge pickle! Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious. All this pickle talk making me hungry. I know, but you you was talking. Finish what you was, go ahead. I'm having second thoughts. About pickles? My wedding to Stacy. Oh, I wanna know, let it out, bro! It's, it's not, it's not that, that I wanna call it off. It's just that I'm, I'm thinking about that, doing that. Look, if you not all in on this wedding, bro, tap out now. Nobody will be upset with you if you did. Yeah, except everybody like Stacy and all the Prescotts on the eastern seaboard, both dead and alive. Well, your real friends and family ain't like that. Angela and I got your back no matter what. You were right, man, Stacy and I don't have anything in common. I don't think she's the one for me. She's not. I do still care about her though, but more of in a nostalgic sort of way. Does that make any sense? Yeah, I still get warm and fuzzy around Atari and G.I. Joe, but I don't wanna marry 'em. We need toys. What would we even talk about? I just think that Stacy and I've grown into people who just aren't a match for each other anymore. Hey buddy, what's going on? - Oh my... - What happened to him? Totally messed up his paw. Must have jammed it on something. Uh, I gotta get into the clinic. I don't have my keys. I gotta call Tara. All right, call when you get there, all right? Let's go, I got him. You're here on a weekend. Hi. Hi, you look really nice in your skivvies, in your civies. I'm, I'm sorry, my what? You're, you're not wearing scrubs? I, I've never seen you in regular clothes. Right, yeah, I had to open the office for Dr. Jack. He needs to get into the clinic because his dog got hurt pretty bad. Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. Uh, I can grab that package and just throw it behind the desk, yeah. Um... Did you wanna ask me something? Yes, I, I do, yeah. Um, would you like to get drinks sometime, or coffee, or we, we can do like tacos or, or, or food if you're hungry. Do you wanna take my number? Yes, I would love that. Great, um, yeah, I'll, I'll put it in. That's terrible. Wait, what's terrible? The part where I have to get a new data plan to keep up with Tara's adorable texting sprees, which I'm happy to do, or the part about Jack's dog? Obviously, the part about Jack's dog. Are you thinking of making a- Frankie-feel-better basket? I think I should, right? For Dakota, not for Jack. For Dakota. I'm thinking maybe like my regular basket, but doggy style, dog, dog edition. Like a dog version. Freudian slip, I'll let that pass. I know it's on your mind. Uh, can I help you? Hi, uh, do you by chance know if Dr. Jack is still here? I have a little biscuit bouquet for Dakota. Oh, he's gonna go crazy for that. Uh, how do you know Jack? I'm Boner, by the way. Boner, the legend himself. Wow, uh, I'm Frankie. Jack's my vet, and I'm also writing the piece about Jack and Stacy for the Chronicle. Oh nice! Yeah, he should be right out. He's just finishing up with some vet mumbo jumbo. Okay, well, I, I don't wanna interrupt, so could you- Hey buddy, is Angela on a way to get you? I'm about ready to- - Hi. - Hi. Hey, how did, how did you know I was gonna be here? Oh, my roommate ran into Tara, so I just wanted to drop off a little care package for Dakota. Wow, thank you. Bar, barbecue chips, he's gonna love this. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Give Dakota a squeeze for me. Let me know if you guys need anything. - Okay. - Okay. - It was nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Uh, quick question, uh, now, is it just the dogs that like each other, or maybe, definitely, the owners like each other too? What's matter with you? This is a nice gesture. Okay, doc, whatever you say. Hold this. Okay. All right, buddy, here we go. Listen to me, I know you hate it in here, all right? But just try to rest for tonight, okay? Love you, pal. Uh-uh-uh, don't touch it until you wash your hands. Wow, you look rough. What, you're not excited about your tux? This is really hurting my feelings, Jack. I've told you how important this wedding is to me and I've been doing all this work to make it a beautiful memory for us. Dakota hurt his paw really bad tonight. Can I just have a minute, please? Ugh, you know what, Jack? Sometimes I think you care more about that dog than you do me. My needs are important too, so snap out of it and support me. I'm not being followery enough for you? What? That's what you called me earlier, right? Said I was a follower. You know, you say you're not a dog person, but you actually treat me like I'm your dog most of the time, which would make a lot of sense 'cause that's what, that's what dogs do, right? Dogs, dogs like to follow. "Propose to me on Christmas Eve, Jack." I did that. "Make sure it's on a boat, Jack." And I did that. Do this, Jack, do that, Jack, be this, Jack, be that, Jack. You know what? I, I can't do it anymore. How dare you? - Am I wrong? - You are so wrong. No, I'm not wrong. And you know what? I don't, I don't actually need you to be a dog person, but it would be nice if you were an empathetic person to me, and, and to Dakota. And, and, and it would be so great if every once in a while you were someone who just did normal things, you know? - Like, like eat sandwich bread. - Okay. And admit to the fact that you fart like ever. Although, although you did fart and I heard it, 100% heard you fart last March, remember that? Yeah, that's right, baby. You had what? Food poisoning. Remember, you were all like delirious and you let one rip, and it was big and it stunk really bad. And you know what? It was great, because you were a real person that night. So what, Jack? I don't, I don't pass enough gas to be worthy of becoming your wife? This discussion is repugnant. No, this discussion is real, okay? But, but, but we are not real. We are, we are, we, we are two people that did the safest thing that two people can do, we met when we were 12. We, we started dating and said, that's it, let's just be together for the rest of our lives. You know, I, I don't know what kind of midlife crisis you're approaching right now, but it's a bad look for you. You know I'm right. You're not being honest with yourself. No, no, you're wrong, okay? And now, now I'm getting pissed, okay? My face is getting hot and this cooling snail mucin gel is literally curling. I'm just, I'm so blindsided by this outburst of immaturity from you. It's so false that it just, it must just not be you, so I hope you sleep it off, Jack. I'm not- Sleep? I'm not even done talking. You always storm off when I'm not done talking. Stacy, I'm not done talking. So keep talking then. No, I'm not gonna, no, no, no, don't get in bed please 'cause you're- Jack, breaks my heart to say that you and I will never see eye to eye on the things in life that are most important. I think it's the end of the road for us. I'm gonna stay at my parents for a few days, Stacy. Come on, Tuck, you've been in there all night. Look, I have all these leashes for you to try on for your party, huh? No, okay. What about food? You love food, bud. Hello, this is Frankie. Hello, Frankie, this is Nathaniel Wethers, the coordinator of the Rue/Shawn nuptials. Oh, hi. I had a bit of news. The wedding is postponed. Indefinitely. You're out of a story, and I'm being forced to let perfectly passed decor go to waste. Wait, Jack and Stacy aren't getting married? A Prescott family PR rep called me and told me to hold off and not run anything until further notice. I see. Uh, do you, uh, by chance know what happened? Well, off the record, Stacy told me her and Jack were no more. I guess I should have said off the record at the beginning of the call, no? Oops. No, no, it, it's fine. I just, I hope everything's okay. Uh, thank you so much for letting me know. I hope you have another pair to write about this week. Actually, I do. Uh, I have the perfect couple, but I could use your help with something. What kind of extra decor do you have lying around? Hey. - Come here, bro. - What's up, man? Come here, man. Hey, I'm sorry, man. It's okay, I really appreciate you letting us stay here with you and Ang. Anytime, man, anytime. Look at you, you single for the first time in forever. Yeah, I don't, I don't really know what I am right now. Come on, let's go in there, man. Let's get this party started. Get in this pool, man. What are you doing out here? Cheers. Cheers, I appreciate you, buddy. Mm. Anytime. I got a question for you. All right, fire away. You think I'd be a good dog dad? I think you'd be the best dog dad. Are you and Angela thinking about getting a dog? Yeah, yeah, we, we getting pretty close to something like that. That's awesome. Yeah, I guess I just hope I do a good job of taking care of it, like you do with Dakota. You're gonna do great, no doubt about it. - You're right, I can do it. - You can. - It's gonna be a big job though. - Yeah, it is. But you dropped trou and get in his pool. I'm not getting, I'm not swimming. You swim now, we're gonna be running later. No running, nope, nope! God, why don't you put that down and be in the moment? Last text, I promise. You are so lovesick. She really is. I don't think I've ever seen her like this. I really am. It's just we've both been so busy that our entire relationship's just been on here. But she's coming to Tucker's. Speaking of, you did invite Dr. Jack, right? Who? He's like the perfect human man, okay? He's like a sexy animal-loving doctor. Sexy animal-loving doctor? I like the sounds of it a lot. - And he's single. - And he's single. Well, what more could you want? But there are things I need to know like what if he likes water beds? Oh, right. - Or listens to AM radio. - Deep question. Or puts ketchup on steak. - No, who does that? - Ew! Come on, how long are you gonna keep this up for? Exactly, don't you feel that little tug? There's a little tug going on in your heart. It's saying it's the future. "Come to me, come to me. The past is the past and the present is now." And you know what? The future is right around the corner, faster than you think. - Yeah, date him, come on. - Come on. Date this guy. He was engaged. It's very, it's very messy. Messy? Life is messy, honey. There's something knocking at your door and it is a perhaps soulmate. I can't believe that you're not the least bit interested in that, come on. Tucker's the only man I really need in my life. You know you can have Tucker and a human man too, right? That's very true, that's very true. How are you gonna be open to love if you don't find yourself opening yourself open to love? Does that make any sense? - I think so. - Okay, thanks. What about fate? What if I leave it up to the stars? You're gonna leave it up to luminous clusters of gas? No, I like fate. Fate, fate has its hand and everything, you know? If you let it guide you, you'll end up where you need to go. See, your mom is very wise. That's right. - Wise and a little bit... - Don’t. Beautiful, so beautiful. - Yeah, that's right. - So beautiful. That's the right one. You know, procrastination is really cute when you're young, but it's not so cute when you're hitting 40. I am 40 in like 10 years. Well, it comes faster than you think. You know, you're older right now than you were before. You're older now, and right now, now, - now you’re older... - Mom, you're insane! Now you're older, now you're older. Well, that's what happens when you get to be my age, you get to be insane. You're right about that. Hey, listen, I love you both, but I'm good. I am, I'm doing me. Okay, let's see if fate sets us free. Huh, cheers to that. Cheers to that. Wait, are you gonna put syrup on this thing? Okay, you catch it. Morning, you two! Hi! Wow, hey, we're gonna be outta your hair soon, I promise. Oh no, it's fine. We love having you and Dakota here. Yeah, man, stay as long as you need. Dakota can heal and have a yard. We really don't mind, you're family. Thanks, guys, I'm already looking for a place though, and eventually, you will need your guest room back. Oop, about that oop, something we should probably tell you. - On three, right? - One, two, three. We're pregnant. What? Well, I'm not pregnant, she's pregnant, but I did help out. Are you- No way! Give me a hug. Come here, bring it in, oh my goodness. I knew it, I knew it! Yesterday, all that talk about you being a dog dad, that was all just a front man. - We're having a baby. - A baby. Wow. I hope that you are ready to be Uncle Jack. I am ready to be the best Uncle Jack ever. When are you guys due? Um, six months, so we don't need the guest room back until then. Is it a boy or girl? Oh, we want a full surprise on that. That is so awesome. I'm so happy for you two! We love you, Jack. Love you guys too. Um, aren't you guys supposed to be training for the 5K? Yeah, what, what do you mean supposed to be? We're training, right, what are you wearing? Why would you bring that up? Two miles right now, let's go, get dressed. Come on, we were having a good time, we're talking about the baby, and how can you bring up- We're training! We was talking about the baby and everything, everybody was happy. Thank you. All right, don't tell him. I won't. What do you guys think? That one. Now, that one is exactly perfect, just like all the other 20 that you showed us. I don't know. I just, I want something that's effortlessly cool. I want her to fall in love with me. She is gonna love you with or without clothes. Mom. I mean, get your mind out of the gutter. The clothes do not make the woman. You're beautiful. Thank you. Ooh. Oh no. It's her. Hello? How long do we think she's gonna be gone? Well, how long is forever? I agree. Go! Can I ask you some, some fatherly advice since you're gonna be a dad now? Yeah, sure, I can practice. What do you need, son? Well, I've been thinking a lot about this girl. Who you thinking about buddy? Is it a hot celeb? Oh, I bet she hot. Is it Jennifer Lopez? No, Judy Dench. No, Judd Nelson. Will you just let me finish? Well, give me a hint. Does the name start with the letter J? It's Frankie. Frankie, Frankie, barbecue, chips and biscuits girl? Yes. I knew I saw something between y'all. She is awesome. Now, she should be your new girlfriend. Well, look, I don't, I don't know if she's interested in me like that. You want me to gas you up, huh? See, it's rude to make a man that looks like me reassure a guy that looks like you that he's still got game. That's borderline bullying. I, I, I just never, I've never dated anyone who's an adult, Boner. Okay, just shoot her a text message. Say, "What's up?" Shoot her a text and say, "What's up?" I can't do that, I'm a grown man. Okay, I don't know. Put your spin on it. Yeah, see, but that's, that's the thing. We're in this kind of weird space right now where we're, we're friends, you know? But I don't, I don't know if she likes me like that. I mean, I, I think she likes me and I, I think I'm interested in her, but I don't know, like, maybe I like her more than she likes me and that would be awkward, or maybe she doesn't like me at all, and then that would be disappointing. You know, it's, it's a very delicate dance. Yeah, nobody's ever done it before. Let me see your phone. - What are you gonna do? - Just let me see your phone. Are you gonna do a little draft for me? Hey, apple pie. Wait, apple pie? Why you putting apple pie in there? What are you, what are you doing? All right, hey, can I have it back? -Just be cool, I'm still, just- -Can I have it back? Can I just have it? Give it! Hey man, don't do that! You pressed send? You just pressed send? - Yes. - Why did you send that? What? Apple pie? This is a terrible text. You put a bunch of random letters in there too. Look at this. That's from you trying to snatch the phone back from me. Why would you do that? I just... Apple. Is that her? - Wait a minute. - What'd she say? Hold on, she said "Hi, lol, home slice. I'd love to meet you later." Still got it! I still got it. Oh man, I still got it. All right, all right, finish warming up. Okay. - Boner! - Okay. So what's gonna happen to the custom Italian tuxedo? Um, I think that'll probably stay with Stacy. I know it sounds crazy, but she, she loves that tux. Okay. You know, I'm getting a sense it's not in total shock that things didn't work out between you two. Well, she's gonna make a good wife for somebody that just isn't me. And everything that Stacy and I had was in the past, and whenever we did talk about the future, it just, we never really aligned. In what way? Well, I always knew I wanted a family, you know? I don't think deep down Stacy really thought about that much. And I always wanted to have three kids, and, you know, Stacy wanted to have three international vacations a year. Oh boy. Yeah, for me, vacations were just going back and forth to the lake and swimming all day and eating cheese out of a can. Which by the way, if you haven't tried, canned cheese, highly underrated. Are you kidding? I love canned cheese. - Really? - Yes. My whole family would have canned cheese and crackers on all of our camping trips. Mm? Yeah. You know, my parents actually met hiking the Appalachian Trail, so all of our trips growing up were all outdoors, just rope swings and the water. Just a simple life, you know? It was the best. That sounds perfect. How often do you see your family? Uh, not ever. Actually, my parents passed away right before I turned 14. And my sister and I, we don't really have a relationship. I wish we did, but she's not interested. I think maybe I remind her of sad days, so it's just Tuck and me. So I hope his 14th birthday goes a little bit better than mine did. You're a really strong person, Frankie. I appreciate you saying that. I'm not really that strong. I just keep everything locked up, you know? Airtight and sealed shut. I see. I don't let a lot of people in here. Well, I feel honored to be standing at the doorway then, you know, with the hopes of maybe being invited in one day. What are you doing tomorrow night? I have no plans tomorrow. No plans? Well, it is Tucker's official birthday party. Mm. And he is the guest of honor, but you're a close second considering you saved his life, so if you and Dakota would like to come by. Well, Dakota just get out of his cone, and I know if he sees Tucker, he's gonna go nuts, so I'll probably keep him home, but how about if I just came solo? I would like that. - Yeah? - Yeah. There is no pressure to come though. You, you don't have to. I wanna be there. I wouldn't miss it for anything in the world. You got a little. What do we think about these, Tuck, huh? Okay, one day you'll be very impressed with me. Just not today. It's happening. - What? - I have the day off so I can finally go on that date with Tara. It's like your gas clusters are hard at work. She's planned a whole day full of my favorite things. Like, who knows where this could lead? Don't you think this is moving a little fast? I know I could get my heart pancaked by this girl, but I'm gonna go for it. Okay. You take that leap. All right, well, I will see you later tonight, and hopefully with Tara. Uh, by the way, I did invite Dr. Jack and he is stopping by. Frankie, yes, this is a leap! Well, it's like a little mini leap, so. That's amazing. 350 Degrees oven, 40 minutes. What are you making, buddy? - Breakfast for dinner. - Ooh. Angela's at a girl's night, so Boner's cooking for one. Well, two, if you count Dakota. Are you with me? Look at you, you looking good. - Thanks man. - Flowers are a good touch, nice. Yeah, I think I'm ready. - Oh, you ready. - All right, I'm off then. All right, I'm not gonna even wish you good luck 'cause you don't need it. Have fun, champ. Thanks, man. Love you, bro. - Love you back, man. - All right. Get that, Dakota. Not today, it ain't. What the? Whoa, oh! Oh, man. Oh, man! Dakota, call 911! Dakota, I messed up the casserole so I'm ordering pizza. Dakota? Dakota! Oh, no! Dakota! Dakota! What's up, buddy? Dakota got out and I don't know where he is. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm gonna find him. Did you see which way you went? No, no, I'm gonna get that dog. I'm gonna go get that dog. I'm on it. Dakota! This is why I don't take the leap. Dakota! Dakota! Dakota! Dakota! Stacy, I can't talk to you right now. If you're looking for someone, I think I know where he is. Hey. Hey. Came by to grab a few things and he was at my back doorstep. Hey buddy, you know better than that. Get off the couch. That's fine. It's fine? Since when? Since now. Who cares? I've got a soul in here. Okay, well thanks for calling me. We gotta get going. I actually have to be somewhere. Uh, Jack. These last few days, I've thought a lot about things. What about you? Yeah, yeah, I've thought a lot about things too. And you were right, at times I have been a follower, but I also started a successful business and I've been a leader there, and I've taken care of a lot of animals and a lot of dogs, and, and regular old people mean a lot to me. You never wanted to be Mrs. Shaw. That's how I know that this is definitely the end of the road for us. This is really it. Copy, plan B it is. Dylan, you can come out now. Hey, Dr. Shaw. Dylan? Yes, after you and I called off the wedding, Dylan and I accidentally had sex in the medical supply closet at your office three times. Five times. You're not gonna fire me for this, are you, doc? - Yeah. - Hey, I got him, he's fine. Holy cannoli, I'm sorry I left the door open. It was an accident. It's all good. I mean it, don't beat yourself up over it, okay? Have you been running this whole time? I don't know, have I? Check your steps on your phone, the app for the 5K. Okay, hold on. It says 5.3 miles. How many Ks is that? Boner, you just ran 8.5 kilometers, buddy. What? That's crazy. Good job, man, good job. I definitely tore up these hammies. Oh, oh good, that you found him. Okay, good. Hey, lady, date's still going. We completely lost track of time. Heading to Tara's now. Ugh, I'm gonna miss the party and I'm really sorry. Hope you're having fun with Jack though and I'll see you in the morning. Hi. Listen, I, I am obviously running horribly late to Tucker's birthday party, but I am on my way. Uh, the craziest thing happened, Dakota got out. Anyway, he ran to Stacy's. I had to get him from there. Jack, it's fine. You don't have to come by. No, no, no, I, I actually wanna come. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm on my way. I am very familiar with people not showing up. This, this, this is not like that. Two weeks from today you were set to marry someone else. This is too much way too soon. How do I fix it? There's nothing to fix. Honestly, it's not even about you, it's about me. I am, I'm done letting people disappoint me. Sounds like you're pulling a Tucker here, Frankie. Oh Tucker, the dog who wants nothing to do with me? How so, Jack? You're retreating into your crate. Well, maybe I feel safe in my crate. Maybe my crate is only big enough for me. So that's it, you're just- Yeah. You're gonna just spend the rest of your life by yourself in your crate? And yes, you should answer that. Hi. Hi, I told you you don't need to come by. No, but I did need to come by 'cause if we could just stay here with the whole crate metaphor for a minute, um, I don't wanna sound crazy, but what about if we try a co-create situation? What? No, co-crate situation. Jack, I'm sure there are plenty of adorable dogs who would love to share a crate with you. You will have no problem with that. I just happen to be the first one you ran into in the middle of the street. No, no, no, no, no, no, it's, it's, it's not like that. It's, it's, it's actually way, way more than that, um, because the truth is, Frankie, I, I- Jack, it's late. We're all good here. Okay, all right. Take care of yourself, okay? Good night. Good night, Frankie. Hello, ladies. Where are you, uh, going? I'm taking fate into my own hands. I'm moving out, hiking the Appalachian Trail. You're what? Uh, I'm going to go use the bathroom. I, I don't understand. Is this because of Jack? No, no, no, no, I'm gonna take a little time and figure out my stuff. And honestly, I, I'm so sick of listening to people talk about their happily ever after, so. You're quitting your job? Yeah, I am. But first I'm gonna go to this sweet old couple's vow renewal at the beach 'cause they're so adorable and I have a surprise for them, and then I'm out. Come on, Tuck. We gotta go, buddy. Tucker, we have to go. Mel, can you please watch Tucker? Yeah, of course. Clearly, he doesn't wanna come with me right now, so. Now you do this? Hey, how's it going in here? Apparently you have to wash the onesies before the baby shows up. The to-do list grows. Well, Boner will have plenty of time to help you after the race today, and I'm always a phone call away, too. Pretty wild week for you, huh? Yeah, it's been, it's been a week, but everybody's happy now, so. Hm, I wouldn't say everybody. You aim to please, Jack, and that is what makes you a good doctor and a good person. I just wonder, maybe it doesn't have to be done-done with Frankie. She gave me the boot, Ang. I don't, I don't think she's too interested. But you deserve happiness too, and I know that I'm an overly emotional pregnant lady, I have seen you fight to help so many over the years, Boner, me, thousands of animals. Go fight for the girl that you want. You know I'm right. Now go eat something. Love you, Ang. Here we go! And the steps, decorative wall flying in. Okay. Here we go. Hi. To, to, to, to, to, to. What is all of this? My goodness. I am so sorry for interrupting, but I was so inspired by your and Edna's story, and, and two special people deserve something. - Posh. - Yeah. Oh wow, I am sure Edna's going to be thrilled when she sees it. You're all staying for the ceremony, right? Oh, that is so- Count us in! Who does not love love? Merci! Woo! You doing all right? Man, even my knees are sweating. It's okay, man. Look, we're keeping up a good pace. That's the most important thing. Gotta keep on trucking. Man, I just noticed, we separated from the pack. There's nobody around us, man. We're in first place. Actually, we're running dead last. - What? - Yeah. Man. Here it is, finish line, buddy, let's do this. Yeah? Oh, that's awesome. Oh. Huh? Not really supposed to be stopping here, bud. I couldn't cross the line without letting you know something first. What is it bro? I slept with Stacy, too. What? I'm just messing with you, man. What are you- Oh, that's gross, I've never. Oh, but this is real though, I've always admired you for being healthy and athletic, and I never thought I could be like that 'cause I've always just been the big bone, you know? I thought that's what I'd always be, but now that I got Angela and the new baby on the way, I found something that makes me wanna be a better man, and you taught me that I can make that change a reality. Now, you tell me, what do you have in your life that makes you want to be a better man? And you put it in your mind and we can cross this finish line together. ♪ The very thought of you ♪ ♪ And I forget to do ♪ I got it. You got it? - Let's do this. - Let's do it. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

She's not coming back, she's moving. Moving? Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, you're, you're Frankie's roommate, but you're also Tara's- Girlfriend. Oh, oh, that's good.

Well, no, I kind of really need to do this now because I just had to see you right now. Actually, I wanna see you every day. I'm, I'm crazy about you. Jack. Listen, I wanna hike the Appalachian Trails with you, with our dogs, okay? I wanna jump into a river with you, off a rope swing, and one day, I wanna take our kids back to do the same thing with us, okay?
