CHIANG SHENG TS'UI HUNG BROTHEL Hey, what's inside the bag? How come it's moving? Live produce. Of course it moves. Can I have a look? There are plenty of them in there. Feel free to have a look. I get it! The live produce is women. You're smart. Second Brother Lo, let's go and have a look. We have guests! Gentlemen. It's Master Lo and Master Yuan of the Iron Flag clan. Really rare, distinguished guests! Please come in! Serve teal - Ladies from upstairs, serve the guests! - Manager Liang, take it easy. We're here because of the 'live produce' out there and want a look. It was that one. Hey! Bring her in. This... This one is new and from the countryside. Ignorant of customs! I'm afraid she may offend you. How about other girls? What if we insist? I asked you to bring her in. Did you hear me? It seems you two prefer 'fresh produce'. Hey, bring her in! Put her down. Don't you know who they are? They are heroes! This is Master Lo Hsin, Iron Leopard of the Iron Flag clan! This is Master Yüan Lang, Iron Monkey of the Iron Flag clan! - Hurry up and greet them! - Yes. Master Lo. Master Yuan. Open it. If they accidentally offended you out there, please forgive them for Holy Eagle Hall's sake. We know it's Holy Eagle Hall's business. Open it! What's the matter? GUEST APPEARANCE: LUNG TIEN-HSIANG Open it... LAM AFTER-KWAN What are you looking at? Is she your sister? Your name? - My surname is Huang! - Huang? Are you the eighth in the family? A Mrs Huang outside said just now that if her husband was in here, to ask that he hurries back. Yes. Sorry...! It's okay...! Carry on...! What's your name? Lan Hsin. How did you get here? Those two brought me here! Manager Liang, this isn't right! Abducting girls and forcing them into prostitution? No, no...! Her family owes us money! Exploitation! That's another crime! - You can leave now. - What?! Just go. No one will dare stop you. Thank you very much for your kindness! Second Brother, let's also have some fun with live produce. What do you say? Good idea. Not a bad one. Wrap this live produce in a carpet and carry it away. Go on! Hurry! Do it! Where to? Holy Eagle Hall Gambling House. HOLY EAGLE GAMBLING HOUSE Master Lo and Master Yuan, what brings you busy men here today? We want to play a few hands, is that okay? Don't be silly, the pleasure's all ours! As you please! Right, get lost! None of your business! Yes! What would you both like to play? Bet this 'living treasure'. Living treasure? We're talking high stakes here. You better get Manager Tseng. Okay... Manager Tseng, we want to play a few hands. - The bet'll be very high. Do you accept? - A bet? Of course! We run a gambling house, why wouldn't we accept bets? That's good. Today we bet on this living treasure. Living treasure? Could I have a look first? Of course! Look. Manager Liang? Manager Tseng, this is the live treasure we're betting on! This is the brain. It's very useful! Conjures up ideas, such as forcing girls into prostitution! - Worth 100 silver taels, right? - 100? What if you lose? If we lose, this useful brain will, of course, be yours! Old Tseng, don't let them lose! Roll the dice! Old Tseng...! Quiet! Mine. Damn it! Only two points! We'll surely lose! Two points? Hey, hurry up! I can afford to lose! Yes... I have no point! You win! Our luck isn't bad. You win. Still want to go on? Of course! Luck's on our side! Bet 100 taels? Who said that? Bet Manager Liang's hands! Two points again? This set is better than the last one. One point. How lucky! Now we should bet... Manager Liang's feet! Four hundred taels! Manger Liang's heart! How much is it worth? Don't worry. Manager Liang's heart is black and rotten, so it's worthless! Three taels only. We lost! Old Tseng! - We lost? - Yes, we just lost Liang's heart. Give it to him! Hold it...! It doesn't have to be counted! What do you mean? Iron Flag clan don't breed people who lose without paying! I was wondering who the brazen ones were! So it's Iron Leopard from the Iron Flag clan, Master Lo Hsin; and Iron Monkey, Master Yuan Lang. You're Ch'en Hsiang, the Flying Eagle? WONG LIK Here comes another eagle! Manager Liang, excuse us. - Kao Teng of Holy Eagle? - Correct! LU FENG Iron Tiger, Ts'ao Feng? The three animals of the Iron Flag clan are here. Correct, our big brother's here. You're in for the worst! Let's go. HOLDING THE WORLD IN AWE Master. IRON FLAG CLAN Did you cause trouble at Holy Eagle Hall? If Brother Tsao hadn't shown up, I would've burnt that gambling house. Don't oversimplify. It's someone else's territory, so leave after gaining the upper hand. Master, Holy Eagle Hall commit misdeeds and must be eliminated. Holy Eagle Hall's master — Mi Chiu-Kao — Sent someone here to see you! - Send him in. - Yes! Clan Chief Mi said there are some good and some bad at Holy Eagle Hall. Some aspects he may not be aware of. Thanks to your three seniors for giving them a lesson. He is grateful to you. So he'd like to invite Clan Chief and three seniors to reconcile with you. At the banquet, the clan's disciples will apologise to you. Clan Chief Mi is too kind. Please wait outside for a moment. We will tell you whether or not we accept. Yes. If you please... Is it possible Clan Chief Mi isn't aware of what's happening at Holy Eagle Hall? Apologise? Does he take us for children? If we don't go, it will be a sign of weakness. We may as well use their disciple's visit to our advantage. Go ahead. Holy Eagle Hall and Iron Flag clan will have to fight for survival sooner or later. I have prepared surprise raiders. We'll pretend we are going without preparation, but with the real intention of penetrating their ground. Master and us three brothers with the four iron defenders, plus with the surprise raiders I just mentioned, can stun and destroy the leaders of Holy Eagle Hall. Your surprise raiders are... The White-Robed Wanderer, Yen Hsiu, is here. Here comes the surprise troop. Yes! If you please... It's him! Master, this is the White-Robed Wanderer, Yen Hsiu. Our friend Yen's name has preceded him a long time. How kind. I have long heard of the Iron Flag clan and Clan Chief T'ieh in the martial world. I managed to pay my respects to you today. If you please... These two are my brothers. We've met. At the brothel. Hence Brother Yen is called the Wanderer. I've heard it takes a lot of money to hire our friend Yen. It depends on what the task is. Brother Yen currently stays at the brothel and saw the many misdeeds of Holy Eagle Hall with his own eyes. So he voluntarily drew his sword to help. Is our friend Yen doing business at a loss? You'd be subsidising it! Okay. Let's do it this way. Liu Heng. Tell Mi Chiu-Kao's messenger we'll attend the banquet tomorrow night. Yes! HOLY EAGLE HALL Fourteen Eagles! Yes! You will lie in ambush in the back room. When I ask for more wine, that's your signal. Yes! You go and tell the men at the door to frisk the Iron Flag clan first when they arrive. If they're armed, attack them right away! Yes. They've arrived. Clan Chief T'ieh, has anyone brought weapons? Whether or not we have weapons... should be evident at a glance. You want to frisk us? I dare not. They're not armed. Clan Chief T'ieh, I welcome all the heroes here. You are a hero indeed. Is Clan Chief Mi's invitation a cause for concern? You took it too seriously... Everyone, please sit down. I propose a toast to Clan Chief T'ieh and everyone. Cheers. These two underachievers got up to mischief outside. The three disciples of Clan Chief T'ieh taught them a lesson. I have admonished these two to never engage in such illegal activity. Clan Chief Mi's readiness to accept good advice is admirable. How kind. Kao Teng. Ch'en Hsiang. Both of you toast to Clan Chief T'ieh and fellow seniors. And turn over a new leaf from now on. Another toast. - Please! - Cheers again! Where have they all gone? They don't know we're out of wine? - Ch'en Hsiang, go ask for more wine. - Yes. More wine! Clan Chief Mi, what is the meaning of this? You've been in martial arts circles. Haven't you heard there's no such thing as a free lunch? You won't be able to leave now. Attack! Don't let one get away! White robe and silver shuttle! You're the White-Robed Wanderer, Yen Hsiu? Just so. The Iron Flag clan chief knew there'd be no free lunch, so he asked me to be an uninvited guest. Your time's up! Master. I was tricked from behind. This thing is very powerful, shoots with a spring. Master! After I die, the Iron Flag clan will be led by... By... Master, who should be in charge of our clan? You...! Master! Carry the clan chief's corpse back. Yes. First, take Master's corpse and put it in the back room. There are three important matters in this clan right now. The first thing is, of course, to take care of the clan chief's funeral. Secondly, to find the murderer and take revenge for the clan chief. The third thing is establishing a new clan chief, who will not only preside over the aforementioned matters but also to make this clan flourish. Don't let any rascals steal from the place whilst there's a funeral. Big Brother is right. What are your views regarding selection of the new clan chief? Master was murdered; Big Brother is the most senior in the family, naturally the clan chief's successor. This is an important issue, everyone must be careful. An ancient saying is, 'The eldest assumes responsibility.' But if the eldest is not responsible it could be someone else, not necessarily the eldest. Brother Tsao is the eldest and the most eligible. Besides, before Master died, Big Brother asked him who should be in charge. Master clearly said the word 'you'. With the blessing of the teacher, Big Brother needn't be humble. I am not against Big Brother being the clan chief, but regarding Master's choice... When Master spoke about who'd be in charge of the clan, he was looking at Second Brother. Then it would be good that Second Brother becomes the clan chief. Of course it should be Big Brother! Right! Master's clear intention was Second Brother. - We should obey our master's orders. - Master's orders? Brother Yüan said Master was looking at Second Brother. I didn't see that. I only heard Master saying 'you' to Big Brother. I saw it! Enough! Let's not discuss it anymore. We brothers usually get along well. The clan chief's bones aren't cold, and there's fighting over the leadership. Is this a joke? As Big Brother is the eldest, of course he should be our clan chief. But Master... Brother Yüan, Master was killed quickly. No one knows what his orders were. It's best to follow the customs. We should all invite Big Brother to become the clan chief. We respectfully invite Big Brother to become the clan chief. Second Brother! If Big Brother modestly declines, there'll be more disputes. I hope you consider the bigger picture. Al right. As Brother Lo puts it that way, in light of the current situation, I will do so with reluctance. Big Brother! - Constables Huang and Chiang are here. - Invite them in. Yes! Things happen so fast. If you please... Hello, Constables Huang and Chiang. Please sit down. We're on duty, you're too kind. I heard Clan Chief T'ieh was killed. We don't know who'll now be the clan chief. Big Brother Tsao is the new clan chief. We should, of course, congratulate Big Brother Tsao on his new appointment, but the present matter places our brothers in a difficult situation. You two have always been courteous. You may speak openly and discuss it with us. Kao and Ch'en of Holy Eagle Hall filed charges against your Iron Flag clan, saying you gathered a crowd for a surprise attack, killing Holy Eagle Hall's chief and more than a dozen others. What about the murder of our clan chief? We usually keep one eye open and the other closed in these kinds of martial world disputes. But this time Holy Eagle Hall has disregarded such customs and filed a charge against you. We originally wanted to play deaf-mute, but that won't do. Although there were casualties on both sides, they ended up with more deaths. With this dispute going on... Is it possible not to involve SO many people and let me take the blame? That can be discussed. It's just the newly-appointed clan chief Brother Tsao will bear a heavy burden. For us to fulfil our duties, we've no option but to do it this way. I'm so sorry. Gentlemen, Big Brother really cannot leave. Can't another person be the scapegoat? Someone else? Like who? A nobody? How would the other party agree to that? Such as... Someone such as Second Brother Lo. That would do. Then I'll take the blame. - Brother Lo! - Second Brother! It's better for me to go than Big Brother. It's just a small token. Get yourselves some tea, gentlemen. How shameful is this? Besides, there has to be an explanation for this issue. Of course...! You must have an explanation for this issue. But let's say Brother Lo absconded in fear of guilt, what about the authorities? Each province and county would make an arrest and bring him to justice. That's routine. Would states and counties seriously make arrests? Brother Tsao, this idea works. Second Brother Lo can go far from here. After a year and a half, the matter will have died down. Okay, let's go back with this. Second Brother Lo can leave immediately. Bumping into others from the authorities would cause inconvenience. Yes...! Second Brother, I think this... We'll say goodbye. Thank you, gentlemen. Brother Yuan, please see them off. If you please... I never thought it would come to this. Brother Lo, you have to be careful outside. I will, of course, deal with the things here. Don't worry about it. After a year and a half has passed, we brothers can meet again. There's a big brother here, so the little one can rest assured. When things die down, I'll come back to see you. Mr Hu. How many silver taels are there? Bring them for Brother Lo. I gave the remaining taels to the two head officers just now. See how much you can make up, give it to Brother Lo. Yes. Second Brother, once you've found a place to stay, send a letter back; I'll send you money regularly. - Thank you, Big Brother! - I've wronged you. LE T'IEN INN Guest, come inside, please! - What would you like to eat? - Just lodgings. Pick up the pace! Such a big man like you working so lazily. You looked okay when you were lodging. Owing rent for two months. Worse than me! Hurry up! What? Not convinced? Believe it or not, I will hit you! - The bank... - Your money's still not transferred over. This is what's called 'a madman wishing for a wife'. My treat. What would you both like to eat? First serve a bottle of wine and then four taels of spiced beef. Customers are here. Go and wash the dishes in the back! You only know how to be lazy. Guest, please have a seat! What would you like to eat? Welcome, gentlemen! Here...! This table, please! Gentlemen, what would you like to eat? CUSTOMERS ARRIVING LIKE CLOUDS - Waiter! - Coming...! This is yours. Enjoy. 0.33, 0.23, 3.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.3... Hey! Does the person I'm looking for live here? The person you're looking for is Lo Hsin, right? Yes, he stays here. That'll do. Yuan Long! Second Brother! Hey...! Your friend's bill comes to 4.8 silver! Pay it quickly! Also the rent and food money I owe them. We'll go. I have a lot to talk to you about. You don't have any? Neither do I... - Didn't you come to give me money? - No, I... also have a lot to tell you. Hey...! If you have stuff to talk about, pay the bill. There'll be plenty of time. What are you doing? You...! Treasurer, including his tab, I'll still work to compensate for it. We've now something to discuss. Don't bother us. Okay... What's the matter with you? I got kicked out of the Iron Flag clan. Big Brother joined forces with Kao and Ch'en of Holy Eagle Hall to run gambling and prostitution, acting against law and reason. They're even worse compared to when Mi Chiu-Kao was in charge. I couldn't bear it and said a few words. He kicked me out of the clan. Second Brother, it's why I came here to bring you back. You... don't believe me? We've been brothers for years, why wouldn't I believe you? But Big Brother has always been decent, doesn't seem that type. It's different now. Why are you so down? It looks like he didn't send you money. That's true. There are so many rumours out there. Master was killed and his murderer was never found. Some people say that Big Brother is involved. What are you doing? That's a serious matter! Yüan Lang, did you commit any offences for Big Brother to have driven you out? - You're deliberately... - Let go! - Yuan Lang! - Don't block my way! I came here to cause a rift, why would you want me to stay? Yuan Lang, it's not that I don't believe you. But this matter is gravely serious. Too unbelievable. - If Big Brother had killed our master... - I only said there is such a rumour. That's why I came here so you can work things out. What is this? - Left by a guest. - Where's the guest? Why didn't you throw this down, too? What was this guest's problem? He suddenly attacked me with that axe, so I had to... You surely know the ten famous assassins in the martial world, right? Of course I know. The one who went to Holy Eagle Hall with us... The White-Robed Wanderer Yen Hsiu — IS one. 'Iron Axe, quickly escape; Silver Shuttle, don't meet... Silver Shuttle refers to Yen Hsiu, the White-Robed Wanderer. And this iron axe... Could that customer have been the Iron Axe? Almost. Iron Axe is so prominent you can tell at a glance, SO you can escape quickly and kill him. Silver Shuttle still appears to be our friend. Can you remember all of the eight sentences? I remember. 'Iron Axe, quickly escape; Silver Shuttle, don't meet; killing people like killing pigs; poor fortune-teller; can't be bought by gold; the most dangerous naughty kid; one old man brings three kids; laughing whilst bleeding.' The eight men referred to in the last six lines are strangers to us. No one knows who they are either in the martial world. No idea what they look like, how they dress, their status, nor what weapons they use. This is really scary. I want to say one more thing. Believe it or not. After I was expelled from the clan, I have always felt that someone was stalking me secretly. It was the same when I came to see you. Along the way, I heard that the top ten assassins from the martial world have appeared in this area. - You should be careful. - Yuan Lang! My words are one-sided. No wonder you don't believe it. You should check it out for yourself. Yuan Long! Are you done? Add 4.8 silver to the old account. Can you not work? Go to the market and buy five catties of meat. Hurry! Come on ...! Come and buy... tofu! FORTUNE-TELLING Whoever is good, guide the blind man. There are several stone steps here, you have to be careful. Thank you... YU LUNG PORK BUTCHER - Two more steps, go slowly. - Thank you... Poor fortune-teller? Correct! Hey, hurry up, okay? - I'm ready to close! - Sorry. Got delayed by the blind man. - How much do you want? - Five catties. Five catties. Sorry for your trouble. I wouldn't have guessed, fatty, in dealing with you every day, that you'd be a killer? Haven't you heard killing people's like killing pigs? When not in this trade, I only kill pigs. Already the third. Who would pay so many assassins to kill me? You shouldn't have killed him just now, but asked who's behind it. A rule of an assassin is to not disclose their client. Try if there's an opportunity. I rather hope we won't meet again. - Thanks for your help just now. - Put that way I feel like a stranger. Be careful on your way back. Wait for me later at the inn. GUESTS ARE FEELING AT HOME - Guest, do you have a room or... - Want a room! Yes...! If you please. If you please. If you please. MYSTERIOUS This guest... - Wants a room. - Yes! Guest, if you please. If you please...! If you please. Hey...! What takes you so long to buy a few catties of pork? Get it to the kitchen, hurry! Hey...! The guest said he wants to rest. Don't disturb him! It's for that room. - Your wine and food are here. - Just leave it there. Guest, that is a large abacus you're using. A big abacus means a clearer calculation. An iron abacus? Correct. It's an iron abacus! Do you know whose account I'm calculating? A dead man's account? You're the one known as 'can't be bought by gold', Chin Pu-Huan? Too right I'm your daddy Chin. So you have good vision. Speak! Who sent you here? If I told you, I wouldn't deserve to be one of the top ten assassins. What's going on here? It's a dead man! You clearly saw he was going to kill me. But people getting killed in my premises, how could I continue my business? When it's dark, no guests come. Get the body out and rid of it. - Right...! - Landlord, open up! A guest's outside. What is it now? Throw it in the backyard well. We might as well do that! Go quick! Open up! Coming! Bring some wine! Kid, can you drink wine? Who's a Kid? Call me a young knight! - Young knight, how much wine do you want? - Just bring it. Sure...! Bring good food and save a room for me! Yes... Young knight, you may easily stumble in the martial world. Nonsense! I am good at martial arts and have excellent swordsmanship. The most dangerous naughty boy. You're him! Young Master Yang IP'iao! Nothing lives under my moves! I'm afraid this'll be an exception! What was so deadly about this kid? It won't be easy to succeed if someone sees the flaws. How can he see the flaws? By overacting. An assassin must not be exposed. He has to perform well, understand? Oh yes, the ten famous assassins have already shown themselves. Now it's your turn, 'an old man brings three kids'. 'Laughing whilst bleeding'. You've always pretended so well, but you shouldn't have mentioned what you just said. That's prepared me. It's the same with or without precautions. You're dead anyway. Yang -P'iao just said the same. What became of him? That was him. We are us. - You're the one who killed my master? - Yes. You know I won't let it go. Why let me know on purpose? I kill for a living. I could have kept you from knowing. But I am different from other assassins. I've never Killed anyone who didn't deserve it. This time, I was deceived by other people's lies. I realised after that the wrong person was killed. The clan chief of the Iron Flag — T'ieh Lin — was a hero. A good man doesn't do bad deeds, so I let you know. Who lied to you and paid you to kill my master? The same one who paid to kill you. Your big brother, Ts'ao Feng. Yüan Lang didn't lie to me. Wanderer! If you want to take revenge for T'ieh Lin, now is the time. - Why did you save me just now? - I certainly didn't want you to die. - Why not? - I don't know. You should understand why. I'll go back with Yuan Lang to take care of the Iron Flag clan's affairs. Right, that's it. I must take revenge for Master afterwards. Yes. That's how it should be. You let him go? I must clean up the clan first. Maybe it's because he just saved me. I can't have a death duel with someone who just saved me. What are you planning now? I knew you wouldn't lie to me. Yen Hsiu also proved what you said. - But... - It's just one side of the story? That's not what I said. I have to go back and find out the truth for myself. I don't plan to go back to see Ts'ao Feng. I will stay outside. Know where the treasurer keeps the money? - What for? - It's dirty money. You wouldn't want to beg your way back? IRON FLAG GAMBLING HOUSE Master Lo. - Hello. - Manager Tseng, you still recognise me? Master Lo, you're joking. We haven't seen each other for a year and a half? What brings you here today? IRON FLAG IRON FLAG GAMBLING HOUSE The sign's changed... and even the eagle's been covered. Master Lo must know that Holy Eagle Hall is no longer. All these businesses belong to the Iron Flag clan now. 'Different soup but the same ingredients.' The manager's still Old Tseng! I heard that Kao Teng and Ch'en Hsiang are still in charge. This was thanks to Clan Chief Tsao. Clan Chief Tsao? Clan Chief Tsao. - Where are Kao Teng and Ch'en Hsiang? - Master Lo's looking for them? Not here? Master Lo, be seated for a while. I'll look for them. As soon as I find them both, I'll ask them to come and see you. Al right. - Old Hu! - Coming. - What is it? - Play a few hands with Master Lo. I'm going to look for Kao and Ch'en. Master Lo, if you please! Move along, everyone...! Move along...! - If you please... - All right. Please sit down. Lo Hsin is here, just outside! The kid is lucky. How capable were our men...! You come over. Over there! The kid's on a lucky streak today! - Old Tseng, you know what to do. - Rest assured, it won't go wrong. Brother Lo. Master Lo, I finally found them both. Haven't seen you for a year. Looks like you're doing well. We brothers are grateful for the clan chief's confidence. I haven't seen Big Brother since my return. But I always hear people referring to him as the clan chief... My brother's now very prestigious! - You haven't returned to the altar yet? - No. It's inevitable, why rush? Since you are here and in no hurry to return to the altar, and you're on a winning streak, How about us brothers play a few hands with Brother Lo? That's okay. I'll put my winning streak to the test with you two. - Old Tseng, shuffle the tiles for us. - Yes! - He won again! - Again? Let's go take a look...! Let's watch, too! Move along...! Master Lo really is on a winning streak! How much silver do you have there? Four or five thousand taels. Come on, I'll make another bet with you. If I win, I'll get the four or five thousand taels in front of you. If you have a better hand, take this. But. Wait a moment. Don't you want to see what's inside? The word of Brother Kao is there. No need. - Old Tseng. - Yes. Brother Lo, the God of Fortune is with you today. Nothing else to be said. HOUSE DEED This is a residence I bought at East Lane today. It's not too big, only four acres of land. Worth at least tens of thousands of taels! Right...! Old Tseng, you accompany Master Lo soon to go and see the house at East Lane. If Master Lo needs anything, - have it prepared accordingly. - Yes. If you please. Master Lo, the furniture and servants have been arranged as requested by Kao and Ch'en. I wonder if Master Lo is satisfied? Thanks for your help. This is what Master Lo just won. It's all present. Please count it to see if the amount is correct. - No need, you're free to go. - Yes... Whatever else Master Lo needs, please feel free to give orders. ADVOCATE CONFUCIANISM I have been told to serve you. Let me know if you need anything. There's nothing I want now. I want to go out for a while. Both Kao and Ch'en said that a banquet is getting delivered later to welcome Master Lo. When they're here, just tell them I'll be back by sunset. Yes. Yüan Lang, waiting for Lo Hsin? If you're looking for me, I"ll be there. Guest, please go upstairs. TS'UI HUNG BROTHEL Yen Hsiu went into the brothel. Let's find him. No rush. Let's have Ts'ao Feng figured out first. I had just been to the gambling house and gambled with Kao and Ch'en. They deliberately lost a big house to me. I think Ts'ao Feng instructed them to bribe me. You still want to see Ts'ao Feng? I'll go now. You look for the Wanderer and wait for me there. I'll look for Ts'ao Feng first then look for him. TS'UI HUNG BROTHEL As in! Master Yen, someone's looking for you. Yes! I don't know if it's Yüan or Lo. - You're here. - You... Didn't we save you once? - How come you're... - Once? What's the use in that? They caught me again. Please sit down. Did you see Lo Hsin? He went to the gambling house. Kao Teng and Ch'en Hsiang deliberately lost a big house to him. As if to buy him off. I'm afraid it might be Ts'ao Feng's idea. He thinks so, too. He's now going to Ts'ao Feng. Is there any danger? Not immediately. This false benevolence of Ts'ao Feng's will still continue, but it'll be fruitless. He'll be here. Why not have a drink whilst you wait? - But between us... - There is a score to settle. That is a matter for the future. 'If there's wine now, we get drunk today.' Are you worried I poisoned the wine? IRON FLAG CLAN Brother Lo! Why didn't you inform us of your return? Big Brother, has my return been an inconvenience? No! No...! The case died down a long time ago. I meant we should have been notified to pick you up. I'm unworthy! I should be paying respects to Clan Chief. We brothers don't bother with that! Come on, sit down...! Big Brother, you really didn't know I was back? Didn't know at all. Mr Hu. Prepare a room for Brother Lo. If he needs money... No need, I've already been to the gambling house. Strangely enough... not only did I win a large sum, but I also won a house! I thought you had known for some time. Brother Lo, you should've come to the altar as soon as you returned. It's because I've heard many rumours. Big Brother, Holy Eagle Hall has already become part of the Iron Flag clan. Kao and Ch'en are still running gambling and prostitution businesses all over. How's it going? There are difficulties in taking charge. Holy Eagle Hall became part of us with hundreds of people who need feeding. I can't be too harsh on them. The incorporation of Holy Eagle Hall was to turn them from their evil ways. This seems unreasonable. You're right. I'll immediately order them to phase out their businesses. If Big Brother can do this, Little Brother has nothing further. But I only received money twice after I went there. Nothing was posted again. I also encountered assassins several times wanting to kill me. What was that about? Did that happen? Could it have been Kao and Ch'en? Would they be so daring? I must find out. Regarding the dispatch of money... Mr Hu? I sent it monthly. I'll go to the bank immediately to check. Since Big Brother wasn't aware, there's no need to check. Fortunately, Little Brother has come back and didn't suffer any injury. But there's a matter of grave concern that must be resolved. Big Brother, what do you say about Master's death? That matter is still a mystery. No leads from multiple investigations. The Wanderer confessed to me that he had killed Master. Really? Since he confessed to you, did you take revenge for Master? - No. - Second Brother... Because he said that he was only instigated by someone else. Who? You! Brother Lo, you're saying... You! The mastermind of Master's murder! Brother Lo, you and I have been fellow students for years. If you really believe this, then what else do I have to say? My believing or not is one aspect, but it's what the Wanderer said. This is a grave matter. It must be resolved. You find the Wanderer and we'll deal with it. Al right. If this confrontation reveals that I'm behind Master's murder, I will accept the punishment I deserve. If the Wanderer himself committed the crime and even alienates us brothers, Brother Lo, we must take revenge for Master! Of course! Everyone stay here and wait for Lo Hsin to confront the Wanderer! - No one's allowed to leave. - Yes! TS'UI HUNG BROTHEL Wanderer, come with me. Lo Hsin, take a seat and have a drink to calm down. I don't believe you're a fool, you'll understand after thinking about it. I almost fell into Ts'ao Feng's trap. - I don't understand. - Think about it: I go with the Wanderer; Ts'ao Feng still insists it wasn't him, and asserts that the Wanderer is alienating. What would happen then? Although I admitted that I'm the assassin who killed your master, I can't provide evidence that Ts'ao Feng masterminded it. Ts'ao Feng will speak forcefully and with justice, inciting everyone to take revenge for the master. With an angry group, should I stretch my neck out and be killed or fight back? There would be casualties. We'd fall foul of Ts'ao Feng's plan. Then do we help Ts'ao Feng or the Wanderer? This is key! We have no reason to help the Wanderer. But if everyone joins together to kill the Wanderer, there will of course be deaths and injuries. Ts'ao Feng's crime will become even more difficult to investigate. He will remain secure as the clan chief and slowly try to wipe us out later. It is only natural that you take revenge for the master. I'll never avoid that battle at such a time. Just deal with Ts'ao Feng first, don't let him get the upper hand. Yes. But what should we do now? We wait. If we don't go, this matter can't be resolved. Ts'ao Feng will surely become restless. He'll feel compelled to act. Therein lies an opportunity for us. Right. We wait. You wait here. I'll go back to that house and wait. Wait until Ts'ao Feng can't hold his breath. What do you think? Lo Hsin and the Wanderer haven't returned? Right, just as you suspected. As I've said, the Wanderer is no fool. Brother Lo was confused for a while and soon understood. Go out in a while and tell them that the Wanderer has chickened out. - Then ask everybody to leave. - Yes. But, Clan Chief, the next step... Chess must be played step by step. Lo Hsin is quite popular amongst the people. If the matter comes to light, it would be inconvenient to do it myself. Such a game is very tough at first. Kao Teng and Ch'en Hsiang are now pawns in crossing the river; they can only go forward, not back. Here. We brothers offer a toast to Brother Lo! Brother Lo must have known that Brother Kao and I joined Iron Flag. We'll be family from now on. We need you to look out for us. Not at all. Your brother has something to ask. Please don't be offended. Please ask. These businesses you're both running now — Gambling houses and brothels... Are they really Big Brother's ideas? Of course. Brother Lo left this year, he's been in charge of everything. Without his order, who dares to do so? Your big brother is different from before. I saw him today and he really is different from before. Good that Brother Lo understands. He is really different now from before with his prestige. I have one more question. You both deliberately lost the money and gave me this house. Was that also my big brother's order? Since Brother Lo understands, there's no need to say more. So you mean he wanted to buy me off? Brother Lo is a sensible person. With the current momentum of Iron Flag, expenditure is naturally large, which depends on local income. Brother Lo just needs to open one eye and close the other. The clan chief will naturally take care of Brother Lo's needs. What if I won't be bought? We were briefed by your big brother after you left the altar. We would need to close down the businesses if we can't talk you over. Forget about Ch'en Hsiang and me, the brothers still have to be fed. Sorry, that's your concern. Please return this house to Ts'ao Feng! I'm leaving now. Can't you wait a bit to get affectionate? You haven't gone back to your room yet? I got Hsiao Hung for you. Who can you blame if you don't go back? Ignore him. Let him be jealous. Who's jealous? I was just thinking, would something happen if Lo Hsin goes back there? Only if Ts'ao Feng can't control himself. He said he originally planned to use Lo Hsin to deal with me. At least as a means of explaining to the people of the Iron Flag clan. - He wouldn't do anything himself. - Ts'ao Feng might not. But Kao Teng and Ch'en Hsiang... Lo Hsin, if you ask for mercy, I'll grant it with pleasure. This net is made of cow ligaments, soaked in water last night. Under the sun now, the dryness makes it tighter. You should be feeling it. If you don't ask for mercy, it will tighten until your death. Kao Teng, Ch'en Hsiang, what are you doing? I thought you were going to turn over a new leaf. - You still behave like this. - Brother Tsao! Clan Chief, you mean... You're pretty obedient. But Kao Teng has always been arrogant. He's getting bolder. Ts'ao Feng, you're something else. Now that you're done using us, you're kicking us away. You paid us to get rid of Mi Chiu-Kao and made the Wanderer kill your master. The Iron Flag clan and Holy Eagle Hall are now under your control. You burnt the bridge! You still act benevolent and hypocritical in front of Lo Hsin. But it's a pity your efforts are in vain. Look at Lo Hsin. He's dying. It hasn't been in vain. At least I'll get rid of you today, Kao Teng! Ch'en Hsiang, you're finally acquainted. Ch'en Hsiang... you mean villain! Clan Chief, I've always been loyal to you. Good. Lo Hsin's already not far from his death. I don't want any trace left. You wait here for him to die. Report it to me at the altar. Until his death is certain, you must watch closely. - No one's allowed to leave. - Yes. Clan Chief, these people also ask to be brought away. Holy Eagle Hall is long gone. They should all be disciples of the Iron Flag clan. Very good. Brother Lo, I know you're awake. You had been pretending just now, but I didn't say anything. You understand everything now. I just don't understand you. What do you not understand? Ts'ao Feng has already used Kao and me. Now he's going to silence us. And you... He's also worried about people in the clan that are leaning towards you. So he won't do it himself, but use us instead. Once you die, I'll report to the altar. Would he let me live? Joining forces with you and fighting Ts'ao Feng would be my only chance of survival. Kao Teng was going to die at Ts'ao Feng's hands sooner or later. I killed him and sent those people away so Ts'ao Feng won't suspect me for now, which is advantageous. Thank you for saving me. But you still have the wrong idea. What? You still believe in Ts'ao Feng? Of course not. I was suspicious of him at the beginning. Now it's completely clear. I faked being unconscious, but my injuries are real. I simply cannot fight with anyone. I know. The most important thing now is to just leave here. Find a more secret place to recuperate. Leave here? It's too late! Clan Chief has incredible foresight. Anticipating you wouldn't know your place, he asked four brothers to guard outside. Watch him! - Are you going to kill Brother Lo? - Clan Chief said if Ch'en Hsiang rebels, kill him at once. We've got along like brothers for many years. How can you do it? The clan chief's order. It'd be better to consult the clan chief to see how we deal with him. That would work. You and Liu Heng return to the altar and ask the clan chief. Okay. Let's await their return. Fool! The clan chief's command must be fulfilled! Ridding these two so they won't get in the way. You're smart! No wonder the clan chief always says you're capable. Lu Piao! You are really capable. Been together for so many years. Hadn't realised you were such a beast! You are really capable! Clan Chief, what's your final decision? I told you to keep calm and not get excited, what's the hurry? I'll know when the person I just sent comes back. Chief, Lu Piao and Tuan Hsin were killed. Lo Hsin has disappeared. Okay. You should understand that things are not that simple. You stand back. I'll let you know the next step when the time is right. Clan Chief, what do you think about this? If I'm right, it's the Wanderer who saved Lo Hsin. I've been sending someone to monitor him at the brothel. There should be information coming. Clan Chief, the Wanderer and Yuan Lang took Lo Hsin into the brothel. Well? Letting the Wanderer live in a brothel all the time? Letting Lo Hsin recoverate is actually good. Clan Chief surely expects Lo Hsin to fight the Wanderer. If so, we can save trouble. These two people, I can deal with one of them easily; dealing with two of them simultaneously, I'm not sure. Clan Chief always has incredible foresight. It's very hard to say, it may not be certain. I'm yet to deploy another plan. Having used Kao Teng and Ch'en Hsiang, the plan to rid of Lo Hsin didn't succeed. I now have to try to make these two fight each other. It's best if both sides suffer. Getting rid of one at least. It's now known who paid me to kill the Iron Flag clan chief. There should be no doubt. Ts'ao Feng lied to me that T'ieh Lin was going to join forces with Holy Eagle Hall. The people from there would suffer a lot. Later I realised that's what he wanted for himself. Therefore I can't allow that rascal to get away with this so easily. I can only promise you that we will settle our grudges after we have eliminated Ts'ao Feng. Yüan Lang, let Lo Hsin rest for a while. - Let's go for a walk. - All right. Let's go. Do you think Ts'ao Feng will come here? Not before Lo Hsin recovers. Sitting on the mountain and watching the tigers fight is his wishful thinking, waiting for Lo Hsin to clash with me. Let's find somewhere no one goes and teach you how to use this shuttle. Why? To take Ts'ao Feng by surprise at the crucial moment. Remember, when I say critical moment, it's the time to kill Ts'ao Feng. Otherwise, even if my life is in danger, don't do anything. Don't forget, I'm an enemy who Killed your master. The tip can shoot out; you all know this. Ts'ao Feng knows that, too. He's surely mastered a method to counter it. But no one knows, except for the tip of my shuttle, that there's another mechanism. So I don't want you to use it until that moment. Lan Hsin, do you like the Wanderer? I know we won't have an ending. But I can't part with him. Don't be fooled by his appearance, the Wanderer is a good man. There aren't many men like him. Don't give up. I really don't understand you men. To be considered a man, they must practise kung fu. Are you two enemies or friends? Lo Hsin is still recuperating at the Wanderer's place. Should be fine after a while, right? - What do you think? - He should have. Then you two go to the brothel to invite Lo Hsin and the Wanderer over. What if they won't? Tell them I just want to settle our mutual grudge with them face to face. If I wanted to be malicious, I could've started before Lo Hsin's injuries had healed. I didn't have to wait till now. We'll pass Clan Chief's message on and do our best to convince them to come. We believe that the clan chief won't make us betray our friends. Of course not. Besides, both of you will be there anyway. If I had bad intentions, you wouldn't see me as the clan chief, would you? Okay. We'll go now. Clan Chief, - these two people... - Aren't reliable, right? Because of this, Lo Hsin and the Wanderer will trust them. Clan Chief, you are such a genius. What of the matter I asked you to handle? All the men are hiding outside the brothel. Excellent. I'm going out for a while. Clan Chief, you're going to do it yourself? No, now is not the time. Prior to Lo Hsin and the Wanderer having their life-and-death battle, I'd rather not take action. I'm leaving for another matter. - Brother Lo, Brother Yuan. - Now that Brother Lo has recuperated, The clan chief invites both you and Brother Yen to the altar. What's the trick now? Big Brother asked me to tell you that he only wants to settle grievances, face to face. He said if he was being malicious it would've been before he healed, and didn't have to wait till now. What do you think? These two are good brothers. Had it not been for the two of them in the house that day, I'd have died at the hands of Lu Piao and Tuan Hsin before you and Yuan Lang came. Brother Lo, the clan chief is our big brother after all. Surely there is some brotherhood after many years together. Before we came, he promised me he wouldn't make us betray our friends. I came to share that small message. Ts'ao Feng is not my big brother. I don't trust him. Friend Yen, whether you come or not, I'm asking Brothers Lo and Yuan. Tail Ts'ung and I will be there today. If Big Brother does something wrong, Tai Ts'ung and I would die in front of you. Hsiao Liu and I will give up our lives to protect Brothers Lo and Yuan. All right. For these two good brothers. Wanderer, let's take a trip. I can only blame myself. Ever since I got mixed up with the Iron Flag clan, I have always listened to you. All right. Let's go. Third Brother? 'M definitely going! Go, hurry...! What now, gentlemen? I never thought Big Brother would really be like this. Tai Ts'ung, what did we just say? Fight! Hsiao Liu! Tai Ts'ung! Tai Ts'ung and I didn't betray our friends! TS'UI HUNG BROTHEL - Clan Chief Tsao. - Where's Lan Hsin? She's in her room. - Take her away. - Yes! Go! Go! They were good brothers. They really gave up their lives and died in front of us. What are we waiting for? Let's go, find Ts'ao Feng! You're right! Lo Hsin and I are going to find Ts'ao Feng. But you have to stay, Yuan Lang. - What? - Forgotten what I told you that day? Remember what I said that day. Don't act rashly until the crucial moment. Lo Hsin, let's go. Today it's time to settle with Ts'ao Feng. Ts'ao Feng, here we are. Your conspiracy failed again. It seems like you aren't convinced that none of these matters were my doing. Fine. What are you doing to do now? You know very well. I am to clean up the clan today. So how about killing Master's enemy? Do you seek to join forces with him to usurp the clan chief? You wanted my injury to heal, just so I'd fight the Wanderer. 'It's best if both sides suffer. Getting rid of one at least.' I won't let you have your wish! I'm afraid that I still want my wish. Mr Hu! Come out! Lan Hsin? Ts'ao Feng, you ...! You listen up. Wanderer, this woman is your so-called confidante. The Hsin, she helped you heal your injury and you owe her. I don't suppose you two men will let her die, right? Ts'ao Feng, you know I'm a famous wanderer. I'm not buying this. The Hsin? Ts'ao Feng, we're from the same school and know each other's skills very well. I may not be your match one on one, so why use such dirty tricks? Since you know that I'm not afraid of you, I first want you to take revenge against the Wanderer. Then I'll deal with you regarding our own business. If, unfortunately, you are killed by Wanderer, The Wanderer and I will then fight. The matter is very clear. Once you start fighting, I'll release Lan Hsin immediately. Okay! So be it! But will you honour your words? In front of this many people, I'll honour my words. How could I continue as the clan chief otherwise? I'll believe you this time. Brother Yen, if you please. Wanderer, what do you think? Since crossing this pair of brothers, it's always in spite of myself. Al right. You also ought to trust me and Lo Hsin. Release Lan Hsin first, okay? I trust you. I'll let you gain the upper hand this time. - Mr Hu. - Yes? - Release her. - Yes. Release her. Leave quickly. Go away as far as you can. Forget about us. Completely. Don't ever get acquainted with men like us. All right, Lo Hsin, we're destined to have this fight. Come on! Wait! Does this flag belong to Liu Heng or Tai Ts'ung? I'm afraid it just doesn't suit you. - Bring Brother Lo's flag over. - Yes. Brother Yen, if you please. Please! Let's go...!
