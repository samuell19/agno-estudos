I've been on this case for several months now. The mayor himself's got me working day and night on this. Shit. I could have just stayed in the military if I wanted to be cold and tired all the time. Can't say I blame the mayor for his concern. I've met some pretty dangerous men in my time, but this guy, Harry Archibald, he really gives me the creeps. I've got a bad feeling, you know that thing in your gut that tells you when something bad's about to go down, and I'm already in too deep. Nottingham's most powerful men meeting in the shadows at night. I don't know, maybe I'm just being paranoid. Harry, I'd appreciate it if you didn't call my home in the middle of the night. What's going on, Harry? What in God's name are we doing here? What's so bloody urgent? What is all this? A new position in office has just opened up. What position? Yours. What was that? Listen in, we have assets on the ground, call sign Charlie One. You will RV with them 10 clicks southeast from the DZ. To confirm, target's name is Abdul Ali, MI6 have had eyes on him since he left Heathrow and tracked him to his current location. We believe he has information on a high profile target and we need to bring him in. So try not to brass him up. Hey Scotland! Whats happening? Oi, you do know it's part of your initiation. You gotta clean our boots when we get back to cover. I'll make you eat your fucking boots. Hey, easy tiger! I will walk in so much shit, mate, you're gonna clean these boots for a week, bro. F-N-G. Fuckin' new guy! Right stop fucking about, I was in Baghdad while you were in your dad's bag, you'll all be cleaning my fucking boots. Time to switch on, fellas. FLIR has detected multiple heat signatures in the AO. Intel suggests the compound is heavily guarded, so it pays to be a winner. Remember, stay low and move fast. Let's do it! Good luck, gents. Guns at war! RPG! Get down, get down! Choppers are ready for a hot extraction. Lay down some top cover for Green Eye. In my time as defense secretary, I have come across countless examples of bravery and courage all over the world from the men and women serving in our special forces, but none continue to astound more than the results and success of this unit alone. This operation lead to the capture of one of the world's most prolific and high-profile targetsand, and no doubt saved incredible amounts of lives. Although it is your duty to fight and serve in secrecy without public recognition, it is my honor and most humble privilege to be invited here today to present this symbol of gratitude for your courage and great service to your Queen and country. I'd rather her let me take her panties down. Sergeant Jake O'Neil. Good work, Sergeant. Thank you. Whats with all the armed guards? Jakey boy! You wouldn't tell me you're trying the backdoor? Party's just getting started. Don't you look nice? Here's a tenner, right? Will you, will you get yourself a wee drink. 'Cause us boys, we need to have a chat. I can look after myself, thanks, Smudge. All right. Go on. Look mate, there's someone I want you to meet. Sergeant O'Neil, please come in. Corporal Smith, can you give us a minute, please? Shut the door on your way out. Drink. Scotch, Brandy? Do you want to just tell me what this is all about? Take a seat, please. That's what I like about men like you, Jake. Straight to the point, no nonsense. You see it's that, that's what I'm looking for. I've got an offer for you, but I'm only gonna offer it once. I need someone to head up a private operation, someone with some balls who's not afraid to take action. You seem to have earned quite a name for yourself with all your operational success. Now, I have a sideline project that could make you a very rich man and make your life very comfortable indeed. Unless of course, you enjoy spending your life away getting shot at for next to nothing? You think I do what I do for money? I fight for a purpose, not like these mercenaries you got stood around here. Now, you might be impressin' everyone with all of this, but I know exactly what kind of man you are. I wonder what it is you fight for? None of your fucking business. Careful, Jake. There you are. I don't think we've been introduced. Come on, we're going. Jake, you're making a big mistake. Okay. The money's in your account. Look, I've got a lot riding on this, do we have a deal? You fuck me on this, I'll kill your family. What is it? No Jade, wait! Wait! Get through! Are you okay? That was scary. Please, don't ever do that again. Friends? Friends. Come on. He refreshes my soul, even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for he is beside me. Lord, please take care of young Jake in this dark hour. We ask you, Lord, to welcome Martha and Scott into your lights, allow them to dwell in the house of the Lord forever in eternity. You got to take care of Jake. And what the hell do you expect me to do with an eight-year-old boy. Both his parents just got wiped out. We're the only two he's got left. Some of us are still out there fighting real wars, while you're pissin' about playing dress up. You know I can't take him. I'm deep undercover on this Archibald thing. Something big's going down, I can feel it. Anyway, I've got me hands full looking after Jade on my own since, since Mary passed. I'm not cut out to play happy families. My missus gives me enough shit as it is. Finally, she'll have someone in the house she can have a mature conversation with. I dunno mate. It's one big responsibility. Remember Bosnia? How could I forget? One dirty fucking war. Then remember how O'Neil saved your life. You owe it to him to look after his boy. You know, it was the that way, they'd do the same for us. After all the shit us three have been through together, Stupid bastard gets wiped out by a truck. I'll do it for Scotty, but you can break the news to my missus. I have to go away. I know. They said it would be far away. I hope I'll see you again. I made this for you. That way, we'll always remember each other and we'll always be close. I will see you again, I promise. Where's the bracelet? I took it off. Why? Jade, we need to talk. So, you bring me here of all places? How is she? She's good. She struggles with me going away a lot. She makes me happy. I'm, I'm pleased for you. Jade. No, I am, I, I'm really happy for you. Just as long as she's good to you. You know, just as long as one day, one day we can be together, like we promised that we would. I'm gonna ask her to marry me. Okay. Welcome to the party. Fuck me, you big lad. You expecting some trouble or what? Where's the case? Man of few words? No bother. Bring me the case. Think you're gonna love this, pal. Archibald sends his regards. Fucking get him! Please, it was Archibald. Come on mate, it was just business. Where are my drugs? We were told to bring you here and kill you and your crew and then we were gonna split the cash. It's just business. All right. Come on, mate, you all right? Mate? Joey, Joey, get a medic! Take a seat mate, you'll be all right. Hey, are you okay? Come on, son! Fucking cheap shot. Never had you down as a dirty fighter, Mac. There's no school like the old school, kid. Fuck off. It was your folks anniversary last week. Yeah, I know. I knew your old man a long time, Jake. He'd be proud of you, son. Thanks, Mac. This is Mac. Go ahead. Roger that. We're on our way. I'll round up the lads. A state of sheer panic looms over the streets of New Basford this evening as armed gunmen have taken four hostages captive in a dramatic and harrowing incident. Please, just let my family go. They had nothing to do with this, they're so young! Please, just let them go! Mr. Archibald, Independent Times News, has there been indications the motives behind specifically targeting your family? I have no idea why they picked on us, no. Right now, we are using every resource we have to find a peaceful resolution and to bring the children home safely, thank you. Police have surrounded the building behind me, and negotiations are currently underway. The place has been cornered off. Will the police be able to find a calm resolution? At present, it is difficult to say. Yesterday at 1600 hours, four hostages were taken at gunpoint from their home in Nottingham. Run the video. What're you doing? The terrorists had executed a further two family members before taking the hostages to this abandoned factory. We believe the factory is being used for the manufacturing of PBIEDs and the distribution of narcotics. So, be aware of any booby traps or any other little surprises. Now, the hostages are the family MP Harry Archibald, meaning the whole world's eyes are on us, making this a high-profile target. So, no fuck up gents. Let's do this one by the book. I can't fucking believe that. I was fucking well in there. Those two slags were fucking well up for it. Yeah man, proper on it. I was a bit smashed fucking both of them and my attitude could fuck... Would you give it a rest, would you, Smudge? You're fucking boring me. What the fuck has crawled up your ass? You need to chill the fuck out, mate. Maybe get yourself fucking laid or something. Just give me a fucking reason. Jake, that's enough. That's enough. You people like guns. Don't you? Bang! I don't like using guns. I like a knife. I can see the reflection, you see the pretty light? The cold steel. To cut you! Like a little fish, and you can't do anything about it. And then what we'll try and do... I'm looking for the person in charge. You're looking at him. Right, my men have cleared the area. I have some information that may be of use to you. Go on. We've identified one of the terrorists as Abdul Ali. Abdul Ali? We put him away years back. Sir, I have something for you. Don't call me sir, darling, I work for a living. Intelligence report from SRR and MI6, apparently they've been tracking their movements over the last two years. They've discovered a network of drug smuggling, human trafficking across the UK borders to the mainland. The French cut a deal in 2010 to have Abdul released in exchange for one of their journalists, who was captured by GARSI. We've had surveillance on them ever since. We have an electronic log from Dalmar's phone and his PDA. And what did we get? Not a lot, but we do know he's been in communication with Harry Archibald. Archibald? We believe the kidnapping had something to do with a deal that went south between Dalmar and Archibald. These were taken by reconnaissance operatives in Daybrook. Right, let's get Archibald in for questioning, let's see what he knows. Media's gonna have a field day with this. I don't give a fuck about the media. Get him in. Whoever we find inside, I want him covered or killed. Roger that. Okay gents, eight hours at 0630. Sniper in position. No one moves before my go. I've got eyes on lads, ready when you are. Robber One, you are clear to engage. Hustle, gents. Daddy hasn't paid up. Time has run out for you. No, don't take her, don't take her! No! No! Robber One, this is Zero. What the fuck is going on in there? Delta One Zero, this is Bravo One. Keep your eyes on. What's going on? We out. Fuck this. Smudge, no! Cover me! Fire! Canister! Tango down. Trig, rope up. Man down! Cover me! Stop fucking whining. Fuckin' hell! It's just a flesh wound, you pussy. Mac, we need a medic in here now! Tell him to hang tight. As soon as it's clear, I'll send them in and get him patched up. Take this, we need to go after the hostages. Fuck off then! Watch your six. They're in there. Smudge, this is your time to shine. Don't fucking move! Put your hands up! Dalmar! They kidnapped us! - Calm down. - He's got... Calm down! My sister's dead, she's dead, she's... Don't worry, it's all over. They killed her, they killed her. What happened to the boy? Where are the others? They took him. Trig, get in here. You all right? Yeah. It's, okay, you're safe now, yeah? Come on, let's get you out of here. Mac, get medics on standby. Roger that. The MC heading to the exo point. Easy now, easy, come on, come on, come on. Do you want to shoot me then? Do you want to shoot me? Where'd you learn that from? Fucking, color me done up then! If you're gonna shoot me, shoot me! Fuckin' telling me that? You sick bastard! Go on shoot me. Is that what you want? - Yeah, come on. - Why not? This is for Archibald. Hostages are secure. Jake's on his own, Mac, permission to go back in. Bravo One, send SITREP, over. Zero. I'm pinned down. Let me go, please. Now, shut the fuck up. Alfie, is that you buddy? Yes. - You go away! - Please help me! Go away! Listen, I'm lowering my weapon, and I'm coming in. Get away! I'm coming in. Throw the gun down, just throw that gun down! Okay. Throw the gun down! Throw the gun away! You'll be all right, I'm gonna make sure you get home. Let the kid go! Listen to me, drop the weapon! Assad has been taken away, there is no way out for you. Let him go! Believe me, I will shoot him. Alfie, look at me, I promise you, mate, you're not gonna get hurt, okay? Throw the gun down. Honestly, we're getting out okay, okay? It's all over. - Jake! - No! Look what you've done! Medic! I had him, I fucking had him! Jake. Come in! My discharge papers. This is the job, sometimes things go south. We can't win 'em all. Look. The report showed that it wasn't your fault. You did everything you could to save that little boy, so take some time out and get your head together. I watched a nine-year-old boy get his fucking brains blown out by someone that we put away years back. That's above our pay grade. You know the game. When are you going to wake up, Mac? I mean, I know most politicians are lying fucking snakes, but Harry Archibald, I mean, he takes the fucking prize. Doing deals with drug dealers and terrorists and we know that two of his children were shot dead because of some fucked up operation that he was running. Yet he's walking around free, you tell me why? Me and your dad had to get our hands dirty from time to time for the sake of Queen and country, but we never questioned it. That's how wars are won kid. The day your parents died, I vowed to always take care of you. I've looked after you like you were my own son. I trained you to be the best you can be. Your dad was the toughest son of a bitch and the best soldier that I ever knew. He'd be fucking ashamed of you right now. Yeah, well he's not fucking here now, is he? And I'm out. I expected more from you, Jake. Sergeant Jake O'Neil, you're dismissed. Hey! Give me another one. Again. You need to pay your tab, mate. You've been sat there all fucking day. Fucking prick. What the fuck are you doing here? You weren't supposed to be home yet! Jake, just say something, don't get upset! Fuck it. All right, baby, let's get lucky tonight. No more bets, please. 13 black. All right. Come on, I can't believe it. Fuck it, all in. This is insane. Final bets, please. Give me. Five red. The odds seem not to be in your favor mate, sorry. Final bets, please. What can I get you? A cosmopolitan, please. Having a rough night, are we? Yeah, you could say that. Do you wanna get out of here? I'm promise, I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? Jake! He'd be fucking ashamed of you right now. Are you ready now? Stop fuckin' around! Come on. I'm not that kind of girl. No, Jack, what are you doing? What? Get off, not here. It's so fun, come on, girl. No, get off, Jack, I said no. Come on, just enjoy it. Jack, fuck off! What the fuck is your problem? Jack, fuck off, please. - Come on. - Fuck off. Get off me! Hey! What the fuck are you doing? Leave her alone. Who the fuck are you? Fucking get him, get him, go on, get him! Fucking get him, now. - Come on then. - All right, mate. Here, you take this. Take care, mate. Hi there, I'm Ralph, I'm the manager. Hello. Nice to meet you. Come this way. Yeah, sure. Jade, if you're hearing this, then I am already dead. I have left this tape in a safety deposit box that only you will be able to access when you're old enough to understand. Be careful with what you do with it and who you trust. Archibald is a very dangerous man with eyes everywhere and he will stop at nothing. I'm sorry I can't be there for you now, but know I will always love you no matter what, my sweet girl. Jake, wake up. It's okay. Jade? What's happened to you? What are you doing here? Who the fuck do you think you are? Leave me alone. Please Jake, I need your help. Look at me. What can I help with? You're the only one that I can turn to. What else do I have to give? What do you expect from me? I don't care about any of this. And I don't care about you. Leave me alone. You said you would always be there for me. I'm sorry. What is it? It's about my dad, Jake. I told you he was murdered. And now, I have proof. We were on the run, living in the middle of nowhere. Dad knew we were in too deep. The night he was murdered is something that will always haunt me. Dad, what's wrong, what's going on? You need to take this key and hide it. Whatever happens, you do not let anybody know you got it, okay? Dad, you're scaring me Jade listen to me, promise me! I promise. I need you to get under the bed and not make a sound. Now, can you do that for me? I love you! I love you too. Under the bed now, go, go, go, quick! They broke into our house looking for that tape. Nothing would've stopped them until they got what they came for. No one believed me, no matter who I turned to. Not the police, not the social workers, not even you. What's going on, Harry? What in God's name are we doing here? What's so bloody urgent? What is all this? A new position in office has just opened up. What position? Yours. Jade, whats wrong? What is it? Jake, I don't think this is a good idea, I don't think we should go through with it. What if something happens to you, I'll never forgive myself. Jade, listen... No, you listen to me, Jake. You're all I've got left. I can't lose you as well. I can't be on my own again. Nothing is going to happen to us. I said I'd protect you. I'm not going anywhere. You don't understand what this man is capable of. Jake, I told you, remember, he shot and he killed my father right in front of me and no one believed me. No one helped me. He's untouchable. No one's untouchable, not now we have proof. There's no hiding from that. I'm sorry that I didn't listen to you before. So, what are you planning to do? You know he's got the police in his pocket. They're not gonna touch him. That's why I'm not going to the police. And so what? You're just gonna go up there and ask him to hand himself in? That's exactly what I'm gonna do. We've got enough evidence to put him away for a lifetime, and I'm gonna give him the chance to finally do the right thing. Otherwise we'll just go to the media. We can't let him get away with what he did to your father. And what if you get hurt? Jake please, please, let's just leave this now. Let's go away, lets leave here. He's too dangerous. He doesn't know the meaning of the word, but if he tries to fuck with us, then he will. I told you I'll take care of you. So, what do you think? Is this really something you want to get into? Look, I know we haven't always seen eye to eye, but I need your help on this. Help? Help with what, what do you mean? I'm gonna bring him down. All right big man, what's your plan? I need to get inside that building. You're the only one close enough to get me in. I think you are fucking crazy. Do you realize what you're walking into? You'll not get past the front door. Come on, can you help me with this or not? I'll see what I can do. Good man. I knew I could count on you. We've got a problem. Mac. I just wanted to apologize for what happened before. Mate, I'm sorry. I've known you your whole life. You never have to say sorry to me. What's going on? It's Jade. She's in trouble. Why, what's happened? Her dad left her a surveillance tape that proves that Archibald shot the Mayor of Nottingham. So, what's your plan? You can't go to the authorities. We all know how that story will end. That's why I need your help. What do you need? Guns. Are you really sure about this? Kyle was your best friend. And I can't let anything happen to her. Does that thing still work? Could do with a bit of grease. Why? Where are you thinking on taking it? Straight through the front door. Jake, Jake, please help me. Jake! Now, do I have your attention? I swear to god, if you fucking touch her. I think it's time we met. I'm coming for you. He's on his way. Get the men ready. I'm in position now. There's a lotta people down there, kid. South side's all clear. Keep an eye out, stay alert. I have visual. Wait for my go. As soon as you're in the building, you're on your own. Let's move out! Cover me! Move out! Motherfucker! Grenade! My leg! Fuck you! Jake! Jake, can you hear me, over. Jake, Jake, over. He's coming up! He's on his way. He's making his way up to the first floor. Does anyone have visual? Robber Team, come in. Robber Team, do you read me? Hey, soldier boy. Suck on that bitch. Drop it. Why am I hearing gunfire? I said to bring him in alive. Put it down. We've got him pinned down. He's not goin' anywhere. Bring him to me. God save our gracious Queen Long live our noble Queen God Jakey Boy! You know your fucking problem is? You're all this Queen and country shit. Look at you now. You're a fucking mess. Face it, Jake, I'm better than you. I always have been. And it's about time you found out how weak you really are. Oh, fuck it. You motherfucker. Looks like you've failed, again. You lose, pretty boy. You're fucking pathetic you know that, a fucking disgrace. You think you're so smart with a fucking hole in your head? You know you've always been a little rat. How 'bout if I make that wee girlfriend of yours my bitch as well, yeah? Go on then. Are you gonna fuckin' shoot me or what? You haven't got the balls, have you? Look at me. Look at me! Looks like I always will be better than you, motherfucker. What's happening? Where is he? Smudge, answer me. Jesus Christ, Jake. Let her go. Here we are, rather fitting, don't you think? Thank you for finally joining us, although I must say you're a little worse for wear. Let her go. I've got the tape. You don't need her anymore. Jake, we could've been so good together if you'd just had some sense of ambition. You two just couldn't help yourselves, could you? Jake! You've got what you need. Just take it. And let her go. Come on, just take the fucking tape! You've made your point. Put the gun down. Okay. You think you're being here happened by mistake? I could've had you killed anytime I wanted. Everything you touch and everyone you care about are now gone. And Jade, my little Jade, how beautiful you've become, rather ironic you should meet the same fate as your father for sticking your nose into my business. Do you really think you're gonna get away with this? The police are on their way. I know because I called them. I can see tomorrow's headlines. Special forces operative kills everyone in the building, shoots his beloved girlfriend before turning the gun on himself. You're crazy. You're fucking crazy. You sick twisted fuck. She's done nothing. Just let her go. Give it to me. Pick it up! Don't you fucking touch her. You've got what you need, now let her go! I want you to look at her. Look at her and tell her it's gonna be okay, Just like you told my little boy. It's okay. It's okay. Jade, it's not your fault. I love you. Jade, move! You okay? He fucking shot me. We need to get out of here. Stop, Armed Police! Put your hands where I can see 'em! Lower your weapons, he's one of ours, you idiots. Everybody move back! Move back now. Mac. You don't do things in halves, do you, kid? Nothing a lick of paint won't fix. Who the hell is responsible for this? Do yo know what you've done, how much this is likely to cost? Do you have any regard for public safety? For God's sake, you've just blown up the most iconic building in the city. Let alone my reputation and the government's public image. You special forces are all the same. You all think you're above the law. Who the hell do you think you are, bloody Bruce Willis? You might wanna take a look at this. This is not the last you've heard from me. That's one right hook you got there, sweetheart. You make sure you look after him for me. I will, don't worry. And you, don't let her go again. Cheers, Mac. So, does this mean it's finally over? Well, maybe just one last thing.
