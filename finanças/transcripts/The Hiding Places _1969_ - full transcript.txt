My name is Jorge. What I'm going to tell you happened to me when I was 8. When mom and dad had died, and uncle Andres came to take me to my grandparents'. Jorge! Wait! Mom, dad... don't be afraid, I'm not leaving you here. We must hurry, uncle Andres is looking for me. He doesn't have to find out, it's a secret. Jorge! So are you ready? Come. What are you doing, Jorge? Let's go. THE HIDING PLACES He is so little! What did you expect? Where are my parents? Come in, grandma is waiting for you. What have you done in these two days? - Grandma. - Jorge, son! You're here! - Finally! - Grandma! You're the spitting image of your father. This is your home. You'll take the place he left. Merciful God... Come on, give me another kiss. He's dead tired, put him to bed. - You must be hungry. - We had dinner on the way. - Is father already sleeping? - Poor thing... He's asleep on his feet. Don't you have anything to do? I'm so happy. Your grandma loves you so much. Where is she going? Is grandpa sick? He's sleeping. You'll see him tomorrow. You have to sleep too. Good night, Jorge. Now you've got someone to love, mother. Wait Jorge, don't stumble. Come in and close the door. Am I going to sleep in this big bed? Jorge, this was your dad's room... Before he left me to marry your mother. Whose suits are these? - His. - All of them? Since he was 6... They still have his scent. Let me smell it, grandma. Smells like mothballs. - Why are you waiting to undress? - Mom used to help me. At your age.. Your dad undressed by himself when he was 5. You'll learn to do it in the dark and without looking in the mirror. Have good thoughts. And be good. - Jorge... - What is it, grandma? I'm so happy, son. Your dad was a very good boy. You are too, aren't you? Good night, grandma. Mom! Dad... Now we're all together... With grandma, uncle... Grandpa... Tomorrow I'll prepare your little houses. Mom! Some tickling, to wake him up... Get out of bed, lazy bones... Will he play with us? Stop it! Don't be like that. He's sleeping... Don't you have anything to do? Mom... Dad... I'll prepare your little houses. Now you have your little houses. I know they're not like the others. Without your names and the cross. But instead... you'll listen to each other and you won't get bored. Are you happy? Now we'll all be together. I think the soil is too wet... - Won't you get cold? - Jorge! You'll tell me tonight. It's grandma, I have to go. Hi. Take the basket from the other field, Juan. Don't worry, ma'am. That's how I like it, no need to get you out of bed. Doesn't he look like him? He'll be a good looking man. Just like his dad. Breakfast is ready. Grandpa can't wait to see you. This humidity... I noticed last night in bed. Grandpa... Who is this little mouse? Jorge, you little boy... Your beard is prickly. Stop it, you'll choke him! Eat, and put some bread in it. You have to be strong. Like your father. I guess you spent all the money I gave you for the trip. Here you are. - What's this? - Everything is written down. I'm sure you spent something on those obscenities you men are into. Mother... - Do you want some sugar on it? - I don't feel like it. Do as you're told! You're thin as a rake. Open your mouth! Come on! - I'll do the math tomorrow. - Do whatever you want. Did you sleep well? - Has the cat got your tongue? - No, grandma. Answer when you're asked. - I don't want anymore. - You won't get up until you finish it. Mother, I'm going to town. - What do you have to do there? - I need some aspirin, I think I got the flu. Some vinegar and some back rubs should be enough. I'm going anyways. What you really want is to go the pub to get... I don't care what you think. And give me today's pay. I don't have any loose change. Not again, mother. What are you looking at? Come on, your father loved it and you won't be any different. - You know you're going to eat it. - I'm going to be sick, grandma. - Want to start a fight? - Listen to your grandma, Jorge. What's that? Who did that to you? - I ran into a door. - I'd say a fist. Who knows who you were with last night... Guess who. Your proteg?s, mother. Come with me, Jorge. - Hi, Marcela. Feeling better? - How are you doing, ma'am? What about you? What does the doctor say? You should resign yourself, God has his own plans. Yes, ma'am. - And who is this pretty little boy? - Don't touch him. - He's my grandson, Jorge. - Is he the son of...? - Yes, of my dead son. - He's very handsome, ma'am. He looks like his dad. He used to attract some attention. - I taught him about trout fishing. - Stop talking and give me that. - Say "thank you", son. - Come back inside, Jorge. - So handsome! - Bye! - See you tomorrow. - Thanks. -Bye, ma'am. Does it hurt? - No. - It was Luis? - Luis? - I saw you this morning. Do you know that it's a sin to spy on grown-ups? I didn't want to. Promise me you won't tell your grandma. That way we'll share a secret. Give me a kiss then! No, here... "Let mommy... kiss it better." Will you take me upstairs? You blabbermouth... Go and play. Don't mind grown-ups business! Look at him, he's nosing around! We gave him the slip. I want him to come with us. He seems so lonely and bored. I would never play with him. Gotcha! What are you doing here, Jorge? Don't you have any other grandchildren, grandma? Grandchildren? What would I want them for? You could have them... out of sight. I have only you, my son. You look like your father. It's like he was back with me again. Let me show you something. The boats your father made. You'll love them. This is where I keep your father's treasured memories. What are you waiting for? Come closer. I haven't opened it for a while... You can't understand. It's as if lifting the lid... I sense the scent of his laughter, his play... an elusive scent, that makes me dream. Leave it to me, I'll show you whatever you want. His postcard collection. I used to give him 20 cents for chocolates, and he collected the stickers. He was so thorough. We used to sit in the field and he showed me the birds, the flowers, the animals... I feel like I'm listening to him right now. He knew every name. A spinning top! Everything in here were presents from me. Do you like it? - Can I play with it? - You'll scratch it! Please, grandma. I promise you I won't spoil it. These things are memories not to play with. That's enough. I'll show you more some other time. - I want it now. - Don't be capricious. - What's that, grandma? - You'll see. - He made them himself. - All by himself? He had a gift for these things. - And he was patient... - Nobody taught him? He painted them with watercolors that I got him for his name day. Any piece of wood was good for him. - With this pocket knife... - So little. He made them with it. - This isn't painted yet. - It's beautiful. - If you want it... - I want the spinning top. It's not possible. It floats like a real ship. Mom! - What's wrong, Jorge? - I saw my mom! - It was a dream, Jorge. - No! I saw her! My baby's going to sleep... Since he's such a good boy, his guardian angel will look out for him, and chase away any nightmare. Sleep tight, my dear. - Juan, have you seen Jorge? - Good morning. No, ma'am. He hasn't shown up yet this morning. What's that? - What are you doing there? - Nothing. Go away. - Who taught you that game? - Nobody. I did. Don't lie to me, Jorge! - What are you hiding? - Go away. They say go away! Have you got the flu? All alone among old people, you have no one to play with. - Want to go with Juan? - To the forest? Come on, son. This can ruin someone's leg... Bring me the wineskin. You don't like me, do you? Here, do you want some? No! Your grandma wouldn't forgive me. 20 years ago your dad and I used to come here to cut firewood. He climbed the trees to hunt eggs. - Did he ever fall out? - He was a little monster. He used to fight with every kid in the village. - He beat them all, right? - He got his share of knocks too. He only got along well with your aunt, miss Amelia. Why doesn't she come out of her room? - Who told you that? - Tell me why. She was about to get married... Her boyfriend was shot to death on the new road... ...political reasons. It's 8 years to the day. That's why she doesn't leave her room. It's something you can't understand. Maria! Hurry up, grandma is waiting for you. Grandpa! Grandma! Did you have a good time? You've ripped your pants. Look at your hands and knees! Go and wash up. - Grandpa... - Jorge... - Going to sleep? - Yes. Grandpa... - Why doesn't she come down? - Don't entertain him. - You have to go to bed rightaway. - It's too early. Do as you're told. Have dinner and go to bed. - Good night, ma'am. - Did you turn off the dining room lights? Cloto! Are you there? Amelia! - I was afraid you wouldn't come... - You know I couldn't miss it. One year is a very long time. 8 years... We've lost him forever. Amelia... My love... The ring! I've lost it. I must find it! From now on I'm your wife before your sister... and before God. One year is too much waiting for you, my love. But I know you'd come back if you could. Amelia! - Look at those crazy women! - Shut up, they'll hear you! Go get them! Drunkards! Has she done you some wrong?! Auntie! Wait for me, auntie! It's Jorge! Auntie... With mom and dad, I felt free from the grown-ups' nearness, who couldn't hurt me. Not my grandparents. Not uncle Andres... Not Maria... Nobody. 5, 10, 18, 20, 23, 27... 40, 43, 45... - There are 50 pesetas missing. - Maybe you're wrong? - Do you think I can't count? - I don't know who it could be then. You don't know? It was you, going back to your old ways. - No. -You want to keep what doesn't belong to you. Cent by cent. Like a rat! Everything in here is mine. And you... You don't need to remind me in front of Jorge. Stealing from me, you're stealing from him. It's his! As it was his father's! And mine. - And no one else! - Whatever. You don't leave until you say where you keep the money. - Leave him alone. - Don't get into this. - Here's your money! - You?! Yes. And the other time too. When you blamed yourself to cover me. Andres... At my age, giving me that small amount of money... - And what do you want more for? - You despise me! Don't say that... Not a single word of affection since I was a child. Not to dad nor to Amelia. Never! - The oldest is the only one you cared about. - Andres... - You can't talk to your mother like... - You've always been so rebellious... - I wasn't as lucky as my brother in war. - Don't say that. - He died. - In spite of everything, ...I'm a man like any other. - Where are you going, Andres? Wait! Why you staring at me, Jorge? Jorge, dear... what's wrong? Are you upset? Won't you talk to your grandma? Don't scare me, Jorge... Do you want...? I'm cold... Let me get into my little bed... A storm is coming... careful with the sails! Don't be afraid, you cowards! I'm the captain! What a captain he is! Well, so you're learning... Jorge, don't be mad at me, I was joking. - Give me a kiss. - Grandma says you're a slut. You don't believe her, do you? Won't you give me a kiss? I have to talk to you. - Some other time. - No. It has to be now. Would you do me a favour? Take this upstairs, knock three times and leave it at the floor. Will you? Don't let it drop. What happened? Can't you wait? I couldn't have a word with you in three days. - The old woman suspects something. - All the more reason to be cautious. You don't do your bit. Whenever I think you're with Luis, in exchange for nothing... Maria... you're the only thing I've got... - But sometimes you seem... - No, not here. It's Jorge, auntie. - Jorge? - I wanted to meet you. - I'm sorry, but you can't come in. - Why not? I have to be alone. I'm not like grandma and the rest of grown-ups. I won't talk to you if you don't want me to, but let me be with you. - I know too. - Huh? - About dead people. - Come. - What do you know about dead people? - They're air, and we can carry them - inside of us. - Here? No, here. I've brought them with me. - You're suffering for them, right? - They're in the garden. Want me to show you? Don't you want to? At night, while they're sleeping we'll walk on tiptoe so we won't wake anybody up. Mom and dad loved you so much. And I love you. - Give me a kiss. - Jorge... Give mom a kiss. I'm going out of my mind. - Do you talk with him, auntie? - Yes. - And what does he say? - I even... could see him before. - I want to see them too. Show me! Calm down. When you're alone, close your eyes, you have to put all your effort into it, and they'll come. - Mom and dad, yes. - Because they're not dead. - They're not dead. - They're here. - The others are fooling us. - Who? The ones outside. But if you get by without them, ...you can make it. They'll come! - They'll come. - I know they'll come. - Jorge! - You have to go downstairs. - Can I come back? At night. So they don't suspect, and separate us. - I'm afraid of grandma. - You'll be safe here. - Every night will be like this? - Every night. - And will you talk about mom and dad? - About when we were children. - When we were happy. - When you were at school? - We'd run through the fields in spring. - In spring? - Jorge... - I love you so much, auntie. What are you singing for, Jorge? Finish your meal, we must clear the table. What are you hiding in the greenhouse, Jorge? Two little houses. For whom? For whom, Jorge? This kid isn't normal. He can't be normal living among us. He seems like he's keeping a secret. - He should be attending school. - His father had no secrets from me. - What do you know, mother? - And he won't have them either. Eat, Jorge! Stop fooling around. You're filling the room with smoke. Go outside to smoke! - It's raining, mother. - Stop smoking then. It's the town festival, ma'am. If you don't mind... You won't go dancing this year. I don't want you coming back at 4 in the morning ...like a slag. - That's my business, don't you think? If you want to keep working in this house you won't go. Find someone else then! You stay! And who are you to say that? Do you think I haven't noticed? Stealing from me to give it to that-- - To that shameless woman. - Shameless? You say so! You married my father to cover-- It would be better for you to shut up. I've been quiet since childhood, I'm sick of it. We all know. You only loved Jorge's father. - He was my son. - What about the others? - Aren't we your children? - You're humiliating me. And you, an entire life putting up with... being the substitute of the one who's dead. - Dead! - Don't say that, please. Maria! Maria, open up! Open up, Maria, please! Jorge! - Maria... - Leave me alone! Who does that old hag think she is to stop me?! - Maria, let me tell you something... - You don't want me to have fun. You're wrong. I'll have some fun with him and whoever I want! - I love you. - Yeah, right... You're jealous! - Of him and of everybody! - It's not my fault... It's not his fault... You and I, in exchange for-- It's not enough to bear your dirty hands on me! Maria... I need you. Find someone else! Wait... I won't find anybody. You're the only one who could love me. I don't care about the money. You're everything for me. When I hold you I feel guilty... Stay here. You'll just have to fake some love. - Get off of me. - No, wait! It's not too much to ask. She can't live forever... She's very old, any day now... - Yeah, right... - I'll be the owner. - Hi. - Hi. What's your name? - Jorge, what's yours? - Luc?a. How old are you? - Eight. - Are you a gipsy? - No. - You look like one of them. You're dressing funny, that's why I didn't want to play with you. - Aren't you hot? - A bit. - Do you always come here? - I'm waiting for Nando. - Nando? - He lent me his spinning top, because we're getting married when we grow up. My dad had one just like this. - And now is it yours? - He died... and grandma keeps it as a souvenir. - Are you an orphan? - Yes. You can play with it. Luci! Nando! - Don't you have parents? - No. - He doesn't have friends either. - Don't you get bored being alone? You can come and play with us every day. - Yeah? - Come on, run! This is my garden, you can come whenever you want. It's beautiful. Can I see it? A gift from my father. My father made boats too, and had a pocket knife just like this. See? It floats. I prefer the ones you have inside. - Don't be silly, I still have to paint them. - Wanna play hide-and-seek? Where is it? - I'm safe. - My turn. - Make up your mind! - How impatient. I knew it! I lose every time! Come on, Jorge. Count to 10. And slowly. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... I'm coming! Gotcha! You've lost! - Your turn. - Start to count. I bet he'll be looking for us all day! Lucia! Nando! Where are you? Don't you see it's raining? Luci, I've got to go. It must be late. Nothing, ma'am. I can't find him. Where could he have gone with this raining? Do you want me to keep searching? - Have you looked by the river? - Don't worry. He must be hiding somewhere. Underwater is also a hiding place. And he knows I couldn't find him. Oh my God! What happened, son? Where have you been? Look at you. You'll get a pneumonia. Let me dry you. Are you happy? You'll catch a fever tomorrow. Let me take your jumper off. What's wrong? Why are you silent? I loved your dad. And I love you, I'm your grandma. I'm afraid you don't love me. Say you love me. Without you, I couldn't... You'll have a glass of hot milk and then go to bed. You'll see. From tomorrow on everything will be different. You'll play with your dad's toys. And no more secrets. Promise me? Jorge! - Where are you going, Jorge? - You don't love auntie! What are you doing, Jorge? Don't upset me! Come down, Jorge! Do you hear me? Do as you're told! Get out of there, Jorge! You can't be with her. Amelia! You won't take him from me! - What are you doing? - I didn't want him to get hungry. As long as he's upstairs he won't get a bite. It's no big deal. It's childishness. How is it possible he prefers her over me? From tomorrow on I won't allow him to go upstairs. I'm his grandma. Who knows what kind of things she's teaching him being all alone? A woman who's always been thinking of the same man... ...for years. - I could say the same thing about you. - Shut up! - Why? When your father came to me he told me about that guy leaving you. He wanted to cover it up, and give Jorge's dad a name. I've always liked you... your hair and your eyes... I thought it was my only chance. Otherwise... Please... - I would never have had the chance. - There's no need to talk about that. You looked down on me and our children. - That's not true! - And Amelia and Andres. Because they're mine too. I love them. They're my children too. You'll never understand me. We have nothing in common. Just bitterness. Don't pass it on to that innocent child. Jorge, listen to me... You heard grandma. - It won't be easy for us to see each other. - Grandma? Let's get out of here, auntie. Where to? I'll bring mom and dad and we'll go with you. I'm afraid something will happen to you being all alone. You taught me how not to be alone, auntie. - Yes, Jorge. - How to call mom and dad. You'll need friends to play with. - What's wrong? - If a tell you a secret... ...will you promise me not to get mad at me? - Do you doubt it? - I was... - I was playing with some kids. - Really? - Are you friends now? - I had a snack at their house, there's a big garden, a pond full of goldfish and... - What are their names? - Lucia and Nando. He makes wooden boats like dad used to do, and Lucia is... ...she's dressed like... - Jorge... - What? - Will you see them again? - I don't know, they suddenly left. - You have to feel a keen desire! Yes, auntie. Everybody's sleeping. Want to see them? - Who? - Them. You promised me. We'll walk on tiptoe so we won't wake anybody up. - Here. - Jorge! They're broken. They're gone! - Jorge... - I'm sure it was grandma. Let's go inside before somebody sees us. I don't want to come back to grandma. They'll be back if you make them another house. No. They're gone with the wind, they'll never come back. Come on, Jorge. They can come back if you want to. Yes, I just have to close my eyes and call them... but they're not here, and they won't come. Yes, Jorge... Maybe they're already here. - Mother. - So, you still recognize me... Go to your room, Jorge. - It was you! - Jorge, son... it was for your own good. Are you happy with what you're doing to this boy? - You're driving him crazy. - No... Do you want everybody to end up like you? What are you waiting for? The resurrection? No matter how long you lock yourself up, people don't come back from the dead. They do. Tell her they do, auntie. - What did she tell you? Come to grandma. - No. This is over. From now on you will have to live with us if you want to see him. - And if you don't want to starve... - Have I done something wrong to you? You'll have lunch in here! I'm sick of you and your dreams! Leave her alone, grandma! You're hurting her. He's my grandson, and you won't take him away from me! He's mine! Jorge... Don't you understand? - She's... - Stay away. Jorge! - I want nothing from any of you. - What's wrong? You're evil! Luci, Nando... Nando, Luci! - Hi, Jorge. - Hi. What took you so long? We'll have some snack. - The capital of England... - Berlin. Wrong answer! - The capital of France... - Paris. You got it right this time. A bit more difficult, the capital of China... Beijing... - Beijing! - You didn't know, he whispered it to you! - Me? - I'm gonna show you something... - Check it out. - My pocket knife! Where'd you find it? It's my dad's, I took it from from grandma. No, it's mine. I lost it yesterday when you left. - That's not true! - What about the mark? Show me. - It's my dad's mark. - No, it's mine. - Nando! - It's mine! If you're gonna be like that, here. - Jorge... - Forever? -Yes. - You're friends now. - As long as you don't want it again. - We'll be friends even when we grow up. - That's a long time, ...we have to make a promise. - You're right, so we won't forget. Put your hands together. No matter rain nor sun, nor a thousand years, no matter how far we are, we'll always be together. Forever! You can kiss me if you want to. - No! - Nando. You kissed me too. Yes, but you and I are getting married. We promised. Here, I don't want it. We're not friends anymore. Nando! Wait for me. - We won't see you ever again! - Nando! Lucia! Maria. Maria! Don't you want to see it? I just wanted to give you a surprise. Ordered in the city. - Came today by train. - Let me see. It's beautiful! It must have cost you a fortune. How do you like me? Don't you know who it is? He is... Auntie! They're here! It's dad! Nando is... You really didn't know? He was your dad at your age. So is she...? Luci...? - Don't you dare to think about it? - Mom! Daughter! Just like in the old days, Amelia. - Have you finally come to your senses? - Yes, mother. Luci! Nando! Mom! Dad! Come back, don't leave me alone! Don't be mad at me! It's me, Jorge! I looked for my auntie that night, she was everything I had. And I couldn't find her. That was how I started to resign myself to the world of adults. And started to become a man.
