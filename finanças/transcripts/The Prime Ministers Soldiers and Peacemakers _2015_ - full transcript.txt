(MultiCom Jingle) (relaxed violin, trumpet music) - I arrived in Jerusalem November the 14th, 1947. Just two weeks after I arrived in the country, November the 29th, the United Nations General Assembly passed the Partition Resolution, meaning a two state solution, Jewish State, Arab State. The Arabs declared that they were going to invade the Jewish State and Jerusalem came under siege. All the various Jewish militias of Haganah and Irgun Leumi merged to formed the Israel Defense Forces. Except in Jerusalem. Jerusalem was under so-called internationalized rule and therefore those militias, the Haganah under the leadership of David Ben-Gurion and the Irgun under the command of Menachem Begin continued to operate in Jerusalem and they were not collaborating and they were very hostile towards each other. I had come as a student on a foreign passport and I had in our group others who had foreign passports and when the truce was called and the shelling were ended, the Red Cross agreed to take us out to Tel Aviv. And as we approached Tel Aviv, the first thing that I noticed was lights. Jerusalem was under blackout. And not only there were lights, you could see people in the streets and in the cafes lounging and chatting and strolling. There were cakes and there were cigarettes and Tel Aviv was a totally normal city and so we began strolling through the crowded streets and suddenly we saw from the direction of the beach, we saw this pillar of smoke. Massive, pluming upwards and we asked people, "What is that?" And they told us that's a burning ship, it's called the Altalena. - [Announcer] This ship brings to the new State of Israel its most tragic hour. Beached off Tel Aviv during the night, it is manned by troops of the Irgun, irregular and dissenting faction of the Jewish fighting forces who are determined to land a huge cargo of ammunition. On shore, Haganah, Israeli regulars, forbid the landing as an open violation of the United Nations truce now in force in all Palestine. As the Irgunists hit the beach, open battle breaks out. - I asked Begin years later, "What was this?" And I'm quoting Begin, he said "I brought this ship with volunteers to hand over the arms "to the Israel Defense Forces." But he wanted a certain percentage of them to go the Irgun in Jerusalem which was far more outgunned than was the Haganah in Jerusalem and this, Ben-Gurion refused. Ben-Gurion was absolutely convinced that Begin was out to do a coup and take over the government by force and hence, he ordered the shelling of the Altalena. Begin got on board the ship and then suddenly, (gunshots clacking) shots were being fired at it. Mortars were being fired at it and cannon was being fired at it. The one who had been given the order by Ben-Gurion to shoot the cannon was none other than Yitzrak Rabin. Years later I also asked Yitzrak Rabin what did he recall of the Altalena and he said "I was a young commander in the Palmach." Which were the commando troops of the Haganah. "I popped in the old Haganah "Headquarters to pick something up "and there I received an order over the radio "from Ben-Gurion "to shoot at that vessel and destroy it." I asked Rabin, were you aware that Begin was on that ship? And he indicated he was not aware but what he was very much aware of and accepted, the Ben-Gurion understanding that this was an attempted coup d'etat by the Irgun under Begin against the government of Israel under Ben-Gurion. This was the brink of civil war hardly a month after we'd established a state. Both had started out as rivals and much later on in life, they found this commonality of spirit in what they both wanted to do for the best of Israel. Patriotism governed their body and soul over the whole of their lifetime. Then as a young student in 1948, observing this epic battle between these two men, Yitzhak Rabin and Menachim Begin, I could not have imagined that some 20 years later I would end up in the Prime Minister's Office serving them both successively as a close advisor. Two men who began as soldiers and ended up peacemakers. (relaxed violin, trumpet music) I began working for the government in the 1950s and in the early 1960s, I was seconded to the Prime Minister's Office which was how I began my career in the Prime Minister's Office. I had served in Washington under Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin in the late 60s and returned home in the early 1970s to be appointed Chief of the Foreign Press Bureau under Prime Minister Golda Meir. (relaxed violin music) The mood in Israel in 1974 was rather somber. Our casualties, close to 3,000 dead in the Yom Kippur War. We were still grieving, bodies were still being found and we were going to funerals and to Shiva houses. We'd lost all this cockiness of the post- 1967 Six-Day War stunning victory phase. We realized that we were not the conquering hero of the Middle East. We won the Yom Kippur war in the end but at such tremendous cost. Golda resigns, now we need a new Prime Minister. Who is going to replace Golda Meir? So many of the leadership had been tarnished by the Yom Kippur war debacle. Here was Rabin just returned recently from Washington untouched by the war and the stage was set for a new Prime Minister. And all eyes were on Yitzhak Rabin, the first Sabra, Israel-born Prime Minister in our history. The very fact that we used to call him Yitzhak is emblematic of the informalities on which that Sabra generation was raised. All his predecessors, beginning David Ben-Gurion and then Levi Eshkol, then Golda Meir all stemmed from Eastern Europe. If it wasn't the shtetl then it was the Jewish neighborhood, call it a ghetto, Warsaw or Kiev, wherever. So you had in all Yitzhak Rabin's predecessors this very intense synchronism of nationalism, experience with programs and the poverty, the sheer poverty of Eastern European Jewry at the time. Yitzhak Rabin knew nothing of all that. He'd been born into an intensely Zionist, socialist family. His mother had once been the Commander of the Haganah in Hashlosha. He was born in Jerusalem but was brought up in Tel Aviv. His ambition was to become a water engineer and he ended up in an agricultural school called Kadoorie. That's where Moshra Dian began recruiting teenagers for the Palmach. And so Yitzhak Rabin was reared within this culture of patriotism, of socialism, of responsibility, of self-sacrifice and this is a man who rose in the ranks of the Israel Defense Forces until he became Chief of Staff and this is a man who had an extraordinary brain to analyze situations and reduce them into the nitty-gritty of the essence of a problem and he saw the nitty-gritty of the essence of the problem of post-1967 Six-Day War of the nurturing of the relations between the State of Israel and the United States. This is why he pressed and eventually got the job as Ambassador to Washington and this is what he took with him into the Prime Minister's Office. I received a telephone call soon after, it was from him. "Yehuda, come." And he offered me a job as a personal advisor, more or less picking up the same responsibilities of the type of thing that I was doing at his side when he was Ambassador in Washington. - [News Anchor] Five men were arrested early Saturday while trying to install eavesdropping equipment at the Democratic National Committee. One of them has an office in the Headquarters of the Committee for the Re-Election of the President. - I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice-President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office. - [Gerald] I, Gerald R. Ford do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States, so help me God. - Congratulations, Mr. President. - The thinking that is going on here with the entry of Gerald Ford into the White House is that he had no experience with the Middle East whatsoever, in fact the whole area of Foreign Affairs was something which he was a bit of an amateur. He knew that and one of the first things he did upon entered the Oval Office was to pick up the phone to Henry Kissinger and say to him, "Henry, I need you." And one of his first priorities was to continue trying to facilitate a political process to advance the prospect of peace. Kissinger recommended to Gerald Ford, let's invite Yitzhak Rabin to Washington to talk about this. (classical violin music) A grand party is held by President Ford in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Rabin. Now if you work for the Israeli Prime Minister, then you're in and out of the White House a few times a year and I'd got to know the housekeeper of the White House rather well, her name was Mary Lou. Why did I get to know her rather well? Because I keep kosher and she knew the essence of my dietary requirements and she would prepare for me a vegetarian dish. Comes the night of the banquet and we're sitting at round tables, this was in the State Dining Room upstairs. On my right was Barbara Walters and on my left was General Brown, who was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my place card had been misspelled. Instead of Yehuda Avner, they'd inscribed rather Yeduha Avner and everybody now was being served roast pheasants, roast potatoes, garnished beans except me. So at one point General Brown peers at my place card and says "Yeduha, you're not eating with us tonight?" Whereupon a butler stepped forward and placed before me an extravaganza of color that consisted of a base of lettuce as thick as a Bible. On top of that was a mound of diced fruit, on top of that was a blob of cottage cheese and on top of that was a swish of whipped cream. So the whole thingamajig stood about a foot high and compares to everybody deep brown roasted pheasant and potatoes, it glittered like fireworks and Barbara Walters began to applaud and this caught the attention of the President and he whispered something into the Prime Minister's ear and Rabin whispered something back into Ford's ear, whereupon the President stood up, raised his glass and called over to me, "Happy birthday, young fella." And with that, the whole of the dining room rose to its feet and began chanting "Happy birthday, dear Yeduha." When I finished and we went into the ballroom, I said to Rabin, "Why on earth did you tell "the President it was my birthday?" And he, Rabin who didn't have much of a sense of humor at the best of times, he shot back, "I should've told him the truth and tomorrow "there'll be a headline in the Israeli newspapers "that you ate kosher and I didn't and the religious "parties will bolt the Cabinet and I'll have "a government crisis on my hands, am I crazy?" He was then faced what was probably one of the worst challenges of his life and that was to waltz with Mrs. Ford who herself had been a dancing teacher in her own youth and Rabin kept on treading on her toes. Until Henry Kissinger (chuckles) sidled up to him and said "Yitzhak, leave while you're still ahead, I'll take over." To which Rabin said, "If only for that, I will be "in Henry Kissinger's debt for the rest of my life." (anxious ensemble music) - We couldn't accept the Egyptian position that basically wanted what we offered for the end of the state of war for something which is much less that does not contain any elements of a beginning of peacemaking or a real peacemaking process. - Sometimes the sessions became rather heated. Both men, Rabin and Kissinger, they had a temper. At one point Henry Kissinger banged on the table and said "Yitzhak, "unless you are ready to make concessions, "you will be responsible for the destruction "of the Third Jewish Commonwealth," meaning Israel. To which Rabin, red in the face, he pointed a finger at the Secretary of State of the United States and said "And Henry don't you forget, "you will be judged not by American "history but by Jewish history." And Kissinger stormed out of the room. Shortly afterwards, in the course of a Cabinet meeting, the Secretary comes in and hands a letter to Rabin from President Ford and the letter was a virtual threat of imposing sanctions on Israel. - [Gerald] Dear Mr. Prime Minister, Secretary Kissinger has reported on the imminent suspension of his mission whose objective-- I am writing to convey my deep disappointment over the position taken by Israel during the course of the negotiations. You know from our conversations-- the importance I have attached to the success of the efforts of the United States to achieve constructive results-- The failure to achieve an agreement is bound to have far reaching effects in the area and on our relations. I have directed an immediate reassessment of US policy in the area, including our relations with Israel. You will be informed of our decisions. - As this was going on, a call comes through from Henry Kissinger from the King David saying that he wants to meet the Prime Minister immediately and Kissinger says "Yitzhak, "I had nothing to do with that letter." And Rabin says "Henry, I don't believe you. "You initiated that letter, you even wrote it yourself." Well, there was a mushroom cloud in the room. Henry Kissinger stormed out, got on his plane and everything froze in the relations between the two countries. In the interim following the breakdown of negotiations, President Ford together with Secretary of State Kissinger were in Europe and there they had arranged a whole day secret meeting in Salzburg with President Sadat to see if they could come up with something to break the deadlock because Rabin then would not budge. This virtual collusion takes place. In the course of their discussion, Sadat said he is agreeable to having an American presence in the Sinai and Ford saying he thinks that the American people would be ready to accept this American role and let us see how Rabin will respond. Rabin did not need much persuasion. In fact he saw advantage in it to engage the Americans directly not in the defense of Israel but in a defense interest of Israel. - [Menachem] Mr. Prime Minister, you cannot expect our people to believe that what you signed yesterday changes the fabric of our relations with Egypt today. From March onward when you refused to bow to the Egyptian dictates and to American pressure, Kissinger constantly stepped up his so-called reassessment policy and its grim prophecies, not one of which materialized until you finally capitulated and you signed. - [Yitzhak] Mr. Begin, my government entered into this improved interim agreement because it holds out the promise of a new strategic situation in our relations with Egypt and a new threshold of support from America. This Sinai interim arrangement is a first step in the effort towards taking Egypt out of the alliance of violence against us. - [Menachem] Many of us don't see it that way, Mr. Prime Minister, we see it as an unacceptable gamble. - The conversation ended with a formal handshake and Begin saying to Rabin, "You understand that "I will have to oppose you in public in the Knesset "and elsewhere for this agreement you've signed." Rabin responded to Begin saying "One of the things that I've learned from you, Mr. Begin "is that the task of the opposition is to oppose. "So go ahead and oppose." (dramatic trumpet tones) - It was a few moments or five minutes after takeoff. We were just settling down for something like a two hour flight to Paris. - After a few seconds we saw two young men with guns and people coming from the First Class to our class. - Straight after that we heard a voice in English with a German accent, not a very heavy German accent and he said that he's the new Captain. - I don't think I'd ever seen Rabin so taught, tense, maybe afraid, maybe afraid ever since the Six-Day War. - Uganda is very peaceful and Uganda does not violate any human rights. - When we heard that the plane had landed in Uganda, there was almost a sense of relief and the reason is because Idi Amin, the President of Uganda had received his military training in Israel. As a matter of fact, he was still wearing on his uniform as President of Uganda the Parachuter's Rings of the Israel Army. Although in fact, its doubtful whether he ever parachuted at all. It soon transpired that Idi Amin, he went into cahoots with the terrorists. (anxious violin music) Next thing we learned was that they had carried out a selection, separating the Jews from the non-Jews and the non-Jews were immediately freed. - That was probably our worst moment because of course everybody remembered, I don't know, if he himself was living at the time or he read about it, of all the selections that were done in the extermination camps between Jews and non-Jews and later on between men and women and then later on, selections who was going to die and who was going to live. (anxious violin, trumpet music) - I turned to the Chief of Staff, I asked him "Do you have even the slightest hope "that you would be able to carry "out military action on Thursday?" And the answer was "No, "I would not recommend anything for Thursday, "at least Thursday." Therefore on Thursday morning, I had to wake the Cabinet to make a decision and the decision was to agree to release certain persons, a certain number of persons or to release prisoners for the releasing of all the hostages and I stressed, all the hostages that were held at Entebbe Airport. We continued to prepare our military option but we pursued parallelly these two courses of solution. - Rabin then asked me with Menachem Begin, who was Chairman of the prestigious Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee of the Knesset, now Rabin fully anticipated that Begin was going to say that I, we oppose any negotiations with the terrorists. - [Menachem] Mr. Prime Minister, this is not a partisan matter for debate between the coalition and the opposition. It is a national issue of the highest order. We, the opposition shall support any decision the government adopts to save the lives of Jews. - And here again was an instance of Rabin's appreciation of the stature of Begin, despite their ideological differences. (anxious trumpet, violin music) - When I brought the operation to be approved by the Cabinet, I said "I would be for it even "if we'll have to pay "terms of people who might get killed." 10, 15 or 20 still-- - [Interviewer] Hostages? - Hostages or-- - Soldiers. - Soldiers, still I would be for it. - [Reporter] It was one week almost to the minute after they'd taken off on their ill-fated flight to Paris that the crew and remaining passengers landed back on Israeli soil. It was coincidentally at the exact hour at which the hijacker's ultimatum to the Israeli government was due to run out and the hostages had been warned by their captors that they would die. Yet here they were and amazingly, does not seem too strong a word, back for the most part safe and unharmed and perhaps not a little dazed at the speed and audacity of it all. Reactions shared by most Israelis who'd resigned themselves to having to give way to the hijacker's demands. Last night while the Israeli government was hinting that negotiations were bogged down, it was being executed with an efficiency and ruthlessness that left even the Israelis, not unused to such operations, somewhat breathless. Yet there was sadness. Three hostages died in the gunfight that followed the Israeli landing at Entebbe Airport and this man had gone to Tel Aviv Airport to greet his returning son only to be told that he was dead. Hoped-for joy became bitter grief. - [Yehuda] One Officer of Sayeret Matkal, which is the most elite commando unit had also been killed and that transpired to be Yonatan Netanyahu, brother of Benjamin Netanyahu. Despite that price, this was undoubtedly one of Israel's finest hours, indeed one of Yitzhak Rabin's finest hours. - I, Jimmy Carter do solemnly swear-- - That I will faithfully execute-- - That I will faithfully execute-- - The Office of President of the United States. - The Office of President of the United States. - And will to the best of my ability-- - And will to the best of my ability-- - Preserve, protect and defend-- - Preserve, protect and defend-- - The Constitution of the United States. - The Constitution of the United States. - So help me God. - So help me God. - [Yehuda] We didn't know very much about Jimmy Carter. The public statements which he had made as President-Elect were rather themselves encouraging. - Because we are free, we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere. - I asked Yitzhak Rabin shortly after the election, "What do you think of this man, Jimmy Carter?" Rabin rolled his eyes and he says "Who knows what he knows about the Middle East? "He might have the best of intentions but in the end, "he'll create such turmoil in the region because of "his ignorance of the underlying situation within the area." Following Kissinger, who was Cyrus Vance, the Secretary of State? What were his qualifications to understand the profundity of the complexities? Rabin had described Kissinger as the only American he'd met who really understood the complexities of the conflict, which is one of the reasons why Kissinger along with Rabin were expounders of the step by step, incremental approach towards peace. He made a comment, "I will miss Henry Kissinger. "We had our differences, many an argument. "But at the end of the day, we had good cause with him." (anxious violin, piano music) When a President invites a new Prime Minister, there's usually a banquet. No, this was a working dinner of the most senior officials, members of Congress and senior media and the like. It didn't take place in the State Dining Room but in a smaller one and all was going quite smoothly until Tip O'Neill, a very shrewd politician, the Speaker of the House, probably the third most powerful political man in the United States said to Rabin, "Mr. Prime Minister, why don't you talk to the PLO? "We, a power like America, at the end of the day, "we spoke to our enemies the Vietcong "and we've come to some kind of a settlement with them. "But why don't you do the same with the PLO?" And it was pretty clear to us that it was almost a planted question. That he was not speaking really in his own name but in the name of President Carter and the answer Rabin gave was one of the most eloquent, passionate, persuasive responses I'd ever heard him spontaneously answer. - [Yitzhak] Mr. O'Neill, let me ask you in return, did the Vietcong refuse to recognize the existence of the United States? What basis is there for negotiations with the PLO, whose avowed raison d'etre is to destroy the State of Israel and replace it with a Palestinian State? - A couple of days later Carter made a speech and in that speech he used the turn of phrase of a Palestinian homeland. I remember we flew back from Washington anxious what steps we should take to retain our good relations with America in light of clear evidence on the part of the new Administration that they wanted to bring the PLO into a Geneva Conference process. And it was the usual practice when we flew home, we would relax, preparing for a nightlong flight of some 10, 11 hours and we would sit around and schmooze. On this occasion he was unusually reticent with us, his three, four quote-unquote intimates. He seemed to be sunken within himself. (anxious violin, piano tones) Our Attorney General decided that this has to be thoroughly investigated and in the end he decided that Leah Rabin had to stand trial. Then we see a Rabin of high moral principle. Rabin did two things, number one, he insisted that he too be put on trial since the account was in both their names but the Attorney General refused. The other thing was that he stepped out of office. Minister of Defense Shimon Peres became acting Prime Minister and the elections were approaching. I went to Rabin, I asked him "Do you think that "Peres is really going to win the next election?" And Rabin said "For sure," why? Because his opponent was Menachem Begin. Menachem Begin had just had a massive heart attack. He couldn't take any part at all in the election campaign and we're talking about an election that was weeks away. He thanked me for the work I'd done for him and then he did something which is totally uncharacteristic of Rabin. He got up and he walked around the table and he gave me a hug. I couldn't believe it and this is how I exited the Prime Minister's room, with the feeling of this Rabin hug around me. (applause) (chanting) This was not just an election victory, this was the first time in the history of Israel there was an actual election victory that was bringing about a change of Administration. One such fellow, I asked him, "Why did you vote for Begin, "an Ashkenazi Jew as much as Shimon Peres? This guy began saying that we voted for Begin because he's a proud Jew, he's not afraid to say the word God. We're talking here about a demographic element of society which whether they were totally observant or not, were very, very traditional and were passionate believers. Menachem Begin had difficulty getting to the podium because the crush of people on every side wanted to shake his hand or just to touch him and he mounted the platform and the whole went "Wow, Begin, Begin, Begin." (chanting) He put a yarmulke on his head and pronounced the famous festival blessing of Shehecheyanu, of thanking the Almighty for having enabled him to reach this day and then that evening ended with a resounding Hatikvah. The world press was stunned. This was also fueled by the reaction of the defeated Labor Party here and so you had headlines which called Begin a warmonger, the headlines that the terrorists have taken over the country. You had headlines that all hope for peace are now destroyed by the establishment of this new Likud government. Universally the response was negative to Begin's entrance into office. Not least in Washington DC where Jimmy Carter entered into his diary words of shock. There was Rabin who turned up in classic Rabin style with a short sleeve shirt, open collar. There were three or four of us with Rabin. And let me see, an old Peugeot car straddling the sidewalk, three or four kilometers an hour at two minutes to nine o'clock and Rabin saying "That's Begin in that car." Rabin briefly, almost perfunctorily introduced us to him. Begin shook us warmly by the hand. Then we moved to the adjoining door into the conference room and there this little ceremonial took place of the exchange of the guard. (toast in foreign language) At the end of the ceremonial, Rabin took his leave and we, the Rabinites, feeling anything I would say from morose to depression in the knowledge that we were about to leave this protected cloister the inner sanctum back to our various pursuits. In my instance back to the Foreign Office, fully anticipating to be posted to some Third World country. What happens when you leave a room in which you had worked for many years? You straighten the pens and pencils and the ruler on your desk and then you get up and go through the door, open it, take one last look but as I was doing that, the phone rang and it was the secretary saying that the Prime Minister wants to see me. He was immersed in some paperwork. His face was very gaunt and pale. I extended my hand, he took it half-rising and then sitting and my saying "Mr. Prime Minister, "as a citizen, I wish you all success." And he said "Sit down, sit down." Whenever Begin spoke, it would come out like a pronouncement as if it was an official declaration. - [Menachem] I have this day received an important communication from the President of the United States of America, Mr. Jimmy Carter and Knesset member Rabin suggests I show it to you with a view to preparing a reply. He tells me you have some experience in these matters. - So I started to read this letter from Jimmy Carter. It was a letter inviting him to visit Washington. I even remember the date, in the week of July the 19th, 1977, "when we shall have the opportunity to "reach a partnership of principle between us "leading to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East." So I immediately pounced on this turn of phrase. I indicate, explain that I've never seen this term partnership of principle before. In other words, you may not have a partnership of principle now. He said "That is my reading of it too." And he said "Let's meet at four o'clock this afternoon "and you shall polish "my Polish English. "You will Shakespearize it for me." "What?" said I. He said "You will be my Shakespeare." And he still hadn't said I'm offering you a job. Then immediately he asked me what exactly were my responsibilities under his predecessors and then he asked me to continue and I said "But Mr. Prime Minister, I'm not a member of your party." He said "I never asked you." And then I said to him "Can you give me a few minutes to think this over?" And he said "You'd like to ask "Knesset member Rabin, would you not?" I said "Yes, I think so." And I ran back to my office, I picked up the phone and said "Yitzhak, he's offering me a job." And Rabin said "You ought to take it. "He is an honest man, he is a patriot "and he's your kind of Jew." I knew of no Prime Minister who so intensely prepared himself for a visit to Washington as Menachem Begin. He read every single speech that Jimmy Carter had ever pronounced, particular on matters dealing with the Middle East. He read and reread the minutes of the last meeting that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had had with Carter, which was a very caustic meeting. He was determined to repair the relations between the two countries. He said "I believe Jimmy Carter "to be basically a decent man. "He's a religious man, so am I. "I think he sees that he has a mission "in the Middle East, a peacemaking mission. "But I also think that he is ignorant of "the intricate complexities of the Middle East conflict. "So somehow or other I have to get through to him "what these complexities are." Unlike his predecessor Rabin, who had adopted a step by step process towards peace, Begin said by doing step by step, you are squandering your assets and you're not getting peace in return. "I want to make a comprehensive peace with all our "neighbors and I'm ready to find territorial compromises." We were talking here basically about the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. He didn't say the West Bank and he didn't say Gaza. For the Palestinians, autonomy, he even went further, he called it full autonomy. And so Begin invested a lot of time in trying to find the formula and the language of which he would try to persuade this peacemaker. (military style trumpet music) While over the Atlantic, I dozed off and I woke up to see the extraordinary sight of Menachem Begin on his knees trying to put shoes on Mrs. Begin. He got up with a sigh and I remember him saying "Oh, marriage is not a word, it's a sentence." I said "How did you meet?" And he said that they met in Poland in the house of a mutual friend and there were two twin sisters, 17 years old and though they were identical twins, "I knew immediately that this one," he was pointing to Mrs. Begin, "this one was for me. "I was going to marry her. "So I sent her a letter that life with me is going "to be full of hardship and there may even be jail. "It may even be dangerous." And she wrote back, "I'm not afraid of hardship or danger." And I remember him then cuddling his hand on hers, which was on the armrest and saying "We toast each other every day since." Jimmy Carter gave him a grand reception. He gave him a bugle-sounding reception on the South Lawn of the White House with the Guard of Honor, guns saluting. Clearly somebody'd put a lot of thought on how to welcome this Prime Minister of Israel. - We have with us a very distinguished visitor, Prime Minister Begin and his wife Aliza. He's a man who has demonstrated a willingness to suffer for principle. A man who has shown superlative personal courage in the face of trial, challenge, disappointment but who has ultimately prevailed. - [Yehuda] Every single sentence was utter perfection tailored in order I would say to flatter Menachem Begin. - Thank you very much and welcome, sir. - And Begin I could see was astonished, pleased, delighted by this tremendous surprise of a reception. When the President cupped Begin's shoulder, I distinctly heard him say "Come, "let us begin our talks." The initial pleasantries over, the President said "The "Middle East peacemaking process is very high on my agenda. "I've already spoken to various Arab leaders. "I seek a convening of a Geneva Peace Conference. "It will be based upon "Security Council Resolution 242." Which calls for a comprehensive peace. Then he said something which made Begin sit up. He said "I want to go "beyond Resolution 242, "which speaks only about the end of belligerency. "I want to speak about actual peace treaties." Now no American President had ever said that before, that the purpose of the talks will be actual peace treaties. That's exactly what Begin wanted to hear and so there was a meeting of minds on the concept of comprehensive peace. There was no apparent disagreement on the convening of the Geneva Peace Conference, even as they were meeting of minds on the macro. When it came to the micro, Jimmy Carter made it plain that the end product of the peace process has to include what he called a Palestinian homeland and that Israel would, I think he used the word obviously, have to withdraw to their old 1967 lines. Begin listened. Clearly he didn't want to get into any substantive argument with him at that moment, at which point Jimmy Carter says "Is there anything else you would like to add?" Upon which he said "Mr. President, "I would like to show you a map." - [Menachem] I call it the INSM, the Israel National Security Map. You see these mountains, Mr. President? The Syrians and the Lebanese sat on top of them and we were at the bottom. They shelled our towns and villages in that valley from up on top of these mountains day and night. Haifa as you know Mr. President is our major port city. The Armistice Line was only 20 miles away. Here in the Tel Aviv area live a million Jews 12 miles from that indefensible Armistice Line. This coastal plain is so narrow in parts that a surprise thrust by a column of tanks could cut the country in two in a matter of minutes. There's no going back to those 1967 lines. Abba Eban called them the Auschwitz Lines. No nation can live on borrowed time. Mr. President, the distinction between Jewish national security in the past and Jewish national security in the present is that in the present, our men can defend their women and children. In the past in the Holocaust, they had to deliver them. They had to deliver them to their executioners. Mr. President, I take an oath before you in the name of the Jewish people, this will never, ever happen again. - And then he broke down. Tears welled up in his eyes and you could see him standing there trying to get a grip on himself. God knows what horrific scenes he was seeing in his mind's eye of his whole family that was executed in the Holocaust. And suddenly there was a hush that settled down on the Cabinet Room and he stood there, dignified, weeping, quietly. Jimmy Carter suggested maybe that they break up for an intermission. Begin said "No, no, let us carry on." Then the Head of the National Security Council, Zbigniew Brzezinski looked up and said "So, "are you telling us that you view the settlements "in the West Bank as a matter of national security?" To which Begin said "Yes sir, I certainly am." And the President said "Mr. Prime Minister, "if this be your position and that you refuse "to entertain our matter of withdrawal "from the West Bank to the '67 lines, "then you are ruining the very prospects for peace." And it was then that the Prime Minister said to him in a declarative, even theatrical fashion, "Mr. President, I wish to present to you "Israel's proposal for the making of peace." And he handed over this dossier which was called The Framework for the Making of Peace in the Middle East. And discussion began on the content, which included the Geneva Conference, direct negotiations between Israel and each individual Arab State. Then a discussion began about Jerusalem. His insistence that Jerusalem was the eternal, undivided capital of Israel, indeed of the Jewish people and Brzezinski was saying that "With these conditions, you are making peace impossible." To which Begin said "Israel does not have conditions, only positions." To which there was almost a collective sigh of relief on the other side of the table. This changed the whole tone of that meeting, which ended with a communique from the White House describing the meeting as having been candid, fruitful and positive and all the various cliches that you use in such communiques. (tepid flute music) And what were these feelers? We flew to Bucharest to meet with Nicolas Ceausescu, the Stalinist dictator of Romania in the knowledge that Ceausescu had a close relationship with President Sadat. On to Iran to meet with the Shah, who also was aware of this attempt on Begin's part and the Shah was willing to help to reach out to the Egyptians. Jimmy Carter had no idea what was going on behind in these meetings, these secret meetings. The moment he heard about it, he sent his Secretary of State Cyrus Vance over to Jerusalem, to Cairo to find out what on earth was going on. Clearly Sadat was responding quietly to these feelers. In diplomacy, there are subtleties that require you to listen not only with your ear but with your inner ear and such a subtlety was suddenly floated when one day, Sadat's speaking to his National Assembly in which he expressed a sentence that "I am ready to go to the end "of the world and even to the Knesset "if it will save a single one of my children." And immediately Begin called in Ambassador Samuel Lewis and told him to deliver a message by his government to Egypt that President Sadat would be a welcome and honored guest when he wished to come and then Sam Lewis came and said that President Sadat wishes to receive an official invitation and with that official invitation, Begin also made a speech addressing the Egyptian people directly and that speech was translated into Arabic and was broadcast on the Arabic station. I was dispatched to London to prepare for an impending visit to London of the Prime Minister when suddenly on the Thursday afternoon, I get a phone call, "Come home immediately. "Sadat is arriving in Jerusalem "on this Saturday night." The whole of Ben Gurion was flag-bedecked. Israeli flags and Egyptian flags. Then you hear the roar of the engine as the plane lands and taxis and on its white fuselage are emblazoned the words "Arab Republic of Egypt." Along that red carpet were many, many people who'd fought in the '48 war and the '56 war and the '67 war and the Yom Kippur War. Suddenly the door opened and there he stood, Muhammad Anwar el-Sadat at the door, waving. The man who had tried by every means to destroy us. By war, by boycott, by blockade. There he stood, waving at the people of Israel. I found myself almost squeezed between Golda Meir on my left and Yitzhak Rabin on my right. Then, he came face to face with Golda Meir and they looked at each other deeply and he took Golda's hand in his and Golda said to him, "I've been waiting for you for a long time." Then there was a pause and he said "Well now I am here." And she said "Welcome." And then I overheard Golda whisper into Rabin's ear, "Why didn't he come before the Yom Kippur War?" And "It would've saved so many "lives of our boys and of his." I had been sent ahead to the King David Hotel to make sure that everything there was in order. Into the Hotel they came and up to the Presidential Suite of the Hotel. Prime Minister Begin then asked President Sadat, "Mr. President, why have you come?" To which he allegedly answered "I have come because we have been "fighting a historic war of attrition between us "for 30 years and the cost is too high. "Let us make peace." The next day, Sunday, President Sadat prayed at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount and then he paid his respects at the Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial of the six million slaughtered during World War Two and then on to the Knesset. (dramatic trumpet music) (applause) The Knesset of course was packed and the President of Egypt then rose to speak. He opened with the words "Abeer salam," greetings. (speaking foreign language) And then he proceeded to deliver the speech and what it actually said was the classic, most extreme Arab position. Not a single inch of Arab soil will be up for negotiation. The Palestinian State needs Jerusalem to be returned. Everything had to be restored to what it was in return for peace and then it was Begin's turn to speak and he said "Mr. President, welcome to Jerusalem, capital of Israel. "You knew all our positions before you came. "I never made any secrets of them." I know that Menachem Begin wanted to put on a grand display of the democracy of Israel in the most vivid manner. Hence in the official program, meetings between Sadat and the leaders of all the major parties, not least the leader of the opposition, the Labor Party. This was Golda, this was Peres, this was Rabin. The whole galaxy of the Labor party. It was an almost jolly meeting. - Let us at least conclude one thing. The beginning that you have made with such courage and with such hope for peace, let us decide one thing. It must go on face to face between us and between you so that even an old lady like I am will live to see the day... (laughs) You always called me an old lady, Mr. President. (laughs) - She's not as old as us. - We will live to see the day, whoever signs on the part of Israel, I want to live to see that day of peace between you and us, of peace between all our neighbors and us and Mr. President, as a grandmother to a grandfather... (laughs) may I give you a little present for your new granddaughter and thank you for your present that you have given me. (applause) - [Yehuda] And then in the King David Hotel, a dinner took place. Most members of the Cabinet, el-Sadat with his senior aids and then came time to depart back to Ben Gurion Airport, a repetition of the ceremonial. A final wave as he stood there by the door of the aircraft, then off he went. (chanting) That very evening, we had run back to see on the television Sadat's arrival in Cairo and he was received by hordes and hordes of cheering Egyptians. It was amazing. Begin called me over and said "I want to send "a message to President Carter about the visit." - [Menachem] Dear Mr. President, last night President Sadat and I sat until after midnight. We are going to avert another war in the Middle East and we made practical arrangements to achieve that quest. The exchanges were very confidential, very far-reaching from his point of view. There are differences of opinion, we're going to discuss them. (helicopter whirring) - Imagine the topple from the euphoria of November into the frustrations of December, January, February. We're getting nowhere and soon enough the Egyptian press, most notably the major newspaper Al-Ahram, a controlled government newspaper, called Begin a shilok. It got Begin fuming but Begin with this Jewish wit of his, he started to call himself shilok. On the occasion I scribbled a note to the Prime Minister, I attached to it a draft of a letter I'd Shakespearized to which Begin replied (speaking foreign language), "To Shakespeare" and approving the letter. And as the weeks went by, Jimmy Carter began more and more to put the blame and the responsibility for the lack of progress on Menachem Begin. (relaxed violin, flute music) There were many people in the country who advised Begin to think twice before going to Camp David because if there was to be failure, then Israel's going to be blamed because by this time we knew that Jimmy Carter simply preferred Anwar Sadat to Menachem Begin. There were more crises in Camp David than there were signs of progress. The two men hardly met each other during Camp David. Menachem Begin was a legalist, Sadat was a generalist. Menachem Begin would insist on crossing every T and dotting every I. Anwar Sadat would leave that to others. He was a man of vision, Carter liked that. From the point of view of the mechanics of the whole process, Israel was to be the one who had to surrender up territory, had to give up assets. What did Sadat have to do? If you look at the Camp David Accords, they were not a treaty. These are a set of principles, basically two. The first one is autonomy for the Palestinians over a period of five years in the course of which their final status would be negotiated. The second principle was a Peace Treaty with Egypt, namely that X number of months were now going to be given for the two parties to hammer out between them an actual Peace Treaty. At the very last minute, there was this side letter that Sadat wanted Begin to sign that had to do with Jerusalem, namely that Israel would agree to put Jerusalem on the negotiating agenda. Begin said under no circumstances. What does Jerusalem have to do with President Sadat? Jerusalem is the united, eternal capital of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. I think Carter must have been in some kind of a shock but the fact is you see no mention of Jerusalem in Camp David, nor do you find it in the Peace Agreement. (ominous violin, trumpet music) (applause) - [Reporter] The stalemate was broken by President Carter himself, the personal visit showed how he-- (relaxed violin, flute music) - Today we celebrate a victory, not of a bloody military campaign but of an inspiring peace campaign. - Let there be no more wars or bloodshed between Arabs and Israel. (applause) - Now it is time for all of us to show civil courage in order to proclaim to our peoples and to others no more war, no more bloodshed, no more bereavement. Peace unto you, shalom, salaam forever. (applause) (car horns honking) - I, Ronald Reagan do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the united States. - Samuel Lewis told me that Begin over and over again had warned the Americans that Israel will not tolerate a nuclear Iraq. When the Administration changed over from the Jimmy Carter Administration to now the Reagan Administration, Sam Lewis told me that he'd made a special point in making sure that the coordinating teams would carry this information to the appropriate authorities and it somehow got lost in the process. (dramatic trumpet, violin music) (beeping) - The United States government condemns the reported Israeli airstrike on the Iraq nuclear facility, the unprecedented character of which cannot but seriously add to the already tense situation in the area. - The United States decided to suspend the delivery of aircraft, fighter aircraft because by the law of Congress, you were not allowed to employ American weaponry except for a matter of self-defense. Begin was hammering away that this was what we'd done, the ultimate act of self-defense and Reagan also, he wanted to put the whole thing behind us somehow. - This did appear to be a violation of the law regarding American weapons that were sold for defensive purposes. On the other hand I do think that one has to recognize that Israel had reason for concern in view of the past history of Iraq which has never signed a ceasefire or recognized Israel as a nation. - Begin had every good reason from all of what he was hearing that in Ronald Reagan, there would be a good friend of Israel in contrast to his predecessor, Jimmy Carter. He knew the man was well-disposed from the outset and so he had very, very high hopes. (patriotic trumpet music) (aircraft humming) (gunfire clacking) (crowds screaming) (tense violin music) Begin asked me to contact our Ambassador to Cairo to inform the Egyptian authorities that he, Begin wished to attend the State Funeral as the Head of an Israeli Delegation. This was to cause a momentous headache for the Egyptian authorities, number one, many an Arab leader would be present at the State Funeral and the last thing they would want to see would be the Prime Minister of Israel. And number two was how to handle security of the Israeli Delegation, particularly because the funeral was to be held on the Shabbat and it took tremendous courage on the part of the Prime Minister and his senior colleagues, walking in order to observe the Sabbath Day, walking in the heat some miles to get to the very start on the funeral procession. Begin was mourning, he was genuinely in grief that he had lost not only a political peace partner, he'd lost a man who had become a cherished friend not only one on one but their respective wives and families. I spent the rest of the Shabbat there, flew home on the Saturday night. Obviously the press was waiting. The question that was being pounded was will the peace process hold? - I am convinced that a peace process will continue. President-Elect Mubarak said so yesterday to my colleagues, the Foreign Minister, Defense Minister and Interior Minister and I myself had a long talk with him. Part of it, we led privately our chat and we touched mainly on the problem of the continuation of the peace process and there was no doubt in the minds of either of us that this is going to be the fact and so therefore we don't have any doubt that the peace process will continue. (anxious violin, trumpet music) - I visited Northern Israel, Galilee a few times during this period. It was a situation in which the population of Galilee had become hostage to the unprovoked attacks of Yasser Arafat's PLO. So that hundreds of thousands of people had to spend hour after hour, night after night in their shelters and normal life was almost coming to a standstill. And I remember Ariel Sharon saying "Mr. Prime Minister, "if this kind of escalation continues, "then the prospect of war is very near." (car horns honking) (sirens blaring) That was the last straw and Begin in his own mind had made the decision the time has come to clear out the nests of the PLO from Southern Lebanon and push them back beyond range. Ariel Sharon informed him that to keep them beyond range, we have to establish a line 40 kilometers in Lebanon from our border. (tank shell booms) (gunfire clacking) The complications that had resulted in the course of the advance into Lebanon with the involvement of Syria were such that we now had put Beirut under siege. There was no intention of that in the first place. There were some in opposition led by Shimon Peres and even a few within the Israeli Cabinet, they were not at all sure that Defense Minister Ariel Sharon had not broader ambitions in the first place, beyond the 40 kilometer line that Begin had set. (tank shell booms) (gunfire clacking) (car horns honking) (speaking in foreign language) Bachir Gemayel was negotiating very intensely with Begin for an actual Peace Treaty and then on the eve of his installation, he was assassinated. On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, September 16th, Christian militias entered two Palestinian refugee camps, one called Sabra and the other called Shatila and they went on to commit a horrendous massacre. This was in response to the assassination of Bachir Gemayel. (chanting in foreign language) Sabra and Shatila became a catalyst of all the frustrations of that war in Lebanon. This was the very first time in Israeli society that a war was being waged that was not consensual. The more the casualties rose, the more opposition to the war within rank and file mounted. (shouting in foreign language) There were one or two within Israel's Cabinet who were also interested to bring down Ariel Sharon, that he deliberately misled Begin. The confrontational situation brought about a Judicial Commission of Inquiry. The singular finding was that Defense Minister Ariel Sharon was found to be indirectly responsible for the massacre of Sabra and Shatila. The Commission called upon him to resign from his position as Defense Minister. He was later to accuse Begin of abandoning him in the field because the Cabinet voted unanimously that he should resign and Begin did not seek to reverse that decision. It must have been about a month later that one morning I walk into the Prime Minister's room and there I see him sitting wearily behind his desk, he'd lost weight and he was also very anxious about his wife, Eliza who was in and out of the hospital. You could see the anxiety lines on his features. He said "I must go and meet the President again. "I must clear up these misunderstandings. "I must speak to my fellow Jews. "I have to convince them of our innocence." (somber violin, piano music) The tears rolled down Begin's cheeks and he began to sway back and forth, back and forth and to repeat over and over again (speaking foreign language), "Why did I leave her, why did I leave her?" He was inconsolable. (somber violin music) He was no longer the same man. He was totally enclosed within himself, hardly communicated. He saw nobody except personal staff members. He had difficultly mounting the steps to the Knesset. His voice became ever more slurred, ever more husky. He began to fumble with his pages. He began to repeat himself. It was pitiful to behold. Even the opposition sat there in silence and in respect and in sadness of what had happened to this giant of a man. The idea of my going to London, it had been mulled over for quite awhile. So, in June 1983, I was summoned to the Prime Minister's room and he said to me in the most formal fashion, "Yehuda, the government today has approved "your appointment as the next Ambassador "of Israel to the United Kingdom." (relaxed violin, flute music) He told the Cabinet, "I simply cannot go on." The Cabinet members tried to persuade him but he was adamant, he was stepping down. There was some degree of mystery as to what was the final straw that broke Begin's will because after he resigned, he gave no official reason, he issued no communique, he delivered no address to the nation. He simply took up residence in Jerusalem not far from where his son Benny lived, closed the door and became a recluse, he became a man of silence for nine years. For nine years he did not make a single statement in public. The last communication I had with Begin was on the occasion of his birthday and I sent him a note and he sent me a letter back and the letter was in a way nostalgic, reminding me of the good old days when he would call me Shakespeare. (anxious ensemble music) Our Embassies had received immediate instructions to inform the heads of government that this was to be, at the request of the deceased, a simple Jewish funeral. No Guards of Honor, no gun salutes, not even eulogies. What was going through my mind? What was going through my mind was not merely my first encounter with Begin as Prime Minister but I was on a time machine that took me back to the days of my youth. I was mainstream, I'm a Zionist of the Ben-Gurion school, so when I first came to Israel, I had a certain prejudice towards these separatists, as we thought of them, the dissidents from the mainstream. The man who first taught me to respect what Begin stood for ironically was Yitzhak Rabin. (chanting) (cheering) (applause) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Arafat, Chairman of the Executive Council of the Palestinian Commemoration Organization, His Excellency Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel, the President of the United States. (applause) - In the early 90s, I was Ambassador in Australia and in 1995, Rabin had called me up in Australia asking me to come back and rejoin his team and we set a date in early November that I would meet with him and I would get my job description as a personal advisor to him. When I walked in, we hadn't met each other in a few years and it was kind of a happy reunion. Now this was the Rabin who had shaken Arafat's hand at the official ceremony on the White House Lawn and I couldn't resist by saying "Yitzhak, why did you shake that man's hand?" And in his classic Rabin fashion, he stood up, walked to the window, hands in pockets, stared out of the window and began to deconstruct. He said that we had always considered the Israel- Palestinian conflict a political conflict and a political conflict, he said is solvable by political means. However because of the rise of fundamentalism through Iran, Islamic fundamentalism was spreading over the whole of the Middle East and it was turning the political conflict into religious conflict and there's no solution, he said, to a theological conflict. It's your God against my God and therefore, "I was ready to take this quantum leap "and try and break this Gordian Knot that "the Middle East had become by establishing "first of all a conversation and then "a dialogue with the PLO and making a breakthrough "here for what the people want, which is peace "and peace with security," so he insisted. (applause) Now this conversation took place on Wednesday, November the First, 1995. He said "Let's meet again on Friday, "by which time I'll ask my legal advisor "to draw up your job description." It came to Friday, we briefly went over the job description which he initialed. Saturday night, he attended a peace rally in the square in Tel Aviv. (singing in foreign language) (applause) (gunshots clacking) (crowds screaming) (somber violin music) (speaking foreign language) My wife and I were with friends when we heard the news and it didn't sink in. (alarm blaring) (soft violin, guitar music) Ben-Gurion laid the foundations of the State of Israel. It was his generation that established credos of returning to the soil, of the dignity of labor. The norms of society flourished under this ethos of the original pioneers. Then came Levi Eshkol and he put forward a very compelling case of what was to become a totally new strategic relationship between the superpower the United States and Israel. Golda Meir on the outside appeared to be the grandmother of the Jewish people, her craggy features, her Milwaukee accent. I think Golda Meir was the first Prime Minister we had who had a profound understanding and empathy with the Ashke Jewry. Then there was Yitzhak Rabin with that extraordinary conceptual mind, this man of utter logic. Chief of Staff during the Six-Day War that led us to this outstanding victory. Then came the quintessential Jew, Menachem Begin. This was the first truly ideological Prime Minister whom the land of Israel from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea was sacrosanct. Shimon Peres, a visionary, a man with a tremendous record of achievements and he was to become one of the most eminent of Presidents that Israel has ever had. All of them had this notion of self-sacrifice. In every generation, we have to show our self-sacrifice simply in order to live, simply in order to allow our people to live normal lives. When I first arrived, I looked up an old friend whom I knew from England. Her name was Esther and she used to speak often about her younger sister in London. She once said "I'd love you to meet my sister, Mimi." Whom I did eventually meet and she became my wife. Esther volunteered full time for the Haganah and as the tensions in the country began to mount, she volunteered to enter the Old City and I was horrified. The Jewish Quarter of the Old City was a siege within a siege and it was a place you fled from, that you didn't go into. Esther was killed on the day that the Old City capitulated to the Arab Legion. She passed away as she was saying Psalms. She was 22. In some dugout, a letter was subsequently found in the debris. It was her last letter to her parents in London, to her sister Mimi and to her brother Asher. - [Esther] Dear Mommy, Daddy and everybody, I am writing to beg of you that whatever may have happened to me, you will make the effort to take it in the spirit that I want and to understand that for myself, I have no regrets. We have had a bitter fight, I have tasted hell but it has been worthwhile because I am convinced that the end will see a Jewish State and the realization of all our longings. Very sweet it has been here in our land. I am thinking of you all and am full of pleasure at the thought that you will one day very soon I hope come and enjoy the fruits of that for which we are fighting. Remember me only in happiness. Shalom aleichem, your loving Esther. - [Yehuda] She's buried on Mount Herzl, the Military Cemetery in Jerusalem. Esther is more than an eternal memory within our family. She's a role model. Children here in Israel, when I look at what is demanded of them, this is still a generation that tells us what can we give rather than what can we take. The road that we have walked from the pit to the heights in the space of hardly two generations and it's thanks to the sacrifice of the Prime Ministers and the people of Israel. I have been privileged to watch that happen and be a part of it. (relaxed violin, trumpet music) (orchestral violin music) (orchestral violin music) (orchestral violin music) (MultiCom Jingle)
