Mr. Zhao Master, follow the blue taxi, follow it. Be quick. Comparatively speaking, in the Shanghai Stock Exchange some individual shares rise quicker than those in Shenzhen Stock Exchange, most of which are the shares of the corporations whose assets are being restructured. They rise recently. For example, Beijing Tianqiao followed by An Shan. Those individual shares go up and up, which lead to the rise of the local powerful shares of the corporations which are engaged in merger and acquisition. The temporary tendency of the M&A shares usually means a beginning of new adjustment. Therefore there is a striking contrast between the high-tech shares and high-profit shares. As you said just now, the rise and fall displayed on the scoreboard are uneven, which confuses the share-purchasers, then how do you think of the scale of adjustment when that adjustment may come to a standstill? Director: Lv Le Who are you looking for? Get out. OK. Where up to? Do you remember to come back? Home is best after all. Humph. How do you end the play? What are you going to do? Do you want her or me? Speak. Can't you speak in a low voice? Son is asleep. Humph, son. Where did you go? He has to go to school tomorrow, don't you know? Tell me. I know I made a mistake. But don't press me. Let me think out for tonight, don't you? I press you? I press you? Humph, I press you, who said? When did you carry on with her? Where does she work? She was one of my students. Before, we had some contacts due to teacher-student relationship. And then we had no links at all after she graduated. Recently she's been doing business in medicine and so we had some talks. Don't say more. Don't say more. From medicine business to sleeping together? Sound sleep, isn't it? How shameless you are as a teacher! How could you teach lessons to the students? What are you going to do? What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Tell me. Where did I wrong you? When you at college, I supported you with all the money I earned at night shift. Where did I wrong you? Off your hands. Did I wrong you? You didn't wrong me. It's me that wronged you. I'm terribly sorry. Don't you remember what you said to me in the honeymoon? Love me forever. And now dislike me for getting old? Want to desert me? I'm old too. Ningning. We've got married for over a decade, in which we experienced ups and downs together. It's not easy. We're closely attached to each other even though no love exists. What did you say? What did you say? I mean that I'm much attached to this home. I know you want me to show my attitude towards this matter, right? Actually my short relation with her is no match to our get-together over a decade. Just because of the recent contact with her I did something improper out of impulse. It will end soon. I have deep love for this family. How many times have you had affairs with her? How many times? Tell me, how many times? It's. What's your intention? What are you going to do with us, son and me? Just tell us. No other intention. I think we can go on living as before. How to keep on? How to keep on? I don't know how to express myself. Actually you won't forgive me no matter what I say. You shouldn't have done it. We have to work tomorrow, shall we go to sleep? Is it so simple? Humph, no way. What do you want me to say? That affair... I don't listen. I don't listen. Well, you sleep here alone. I go to the kid's room. Zhao Qiankun, Zhao Qiankun! Do you treat her, do you treat her tell me, the same as me? What the devil do you want me to do or to say? I wronged you. I know you nursed great grievances about it. You feel indignant. But tonight what I can say and what I can do has been said and done. What the devil do you want me to do? Do you really want me to jump down off the building? I, I. Why can't you give me a way out? Zhao Qiankun, Zhao Qiankun, Zhao Qiankun, do you want to divorce me? I didn't say that. When did I tell you I want to divorce you? No divorce. It's me that made mistakes. It's me that is sorry to you. And then is it because I have not satisfied you? No. Then, then, why did you treat me like that tell me, then. Why did you treat me like that? I've told you many times. It was out of impulse that I did something improper. It's my fault. What are you going to do? Tell me! What are you going to do? Can't we live on well like this. We can go on living together as before. I'll end my contacts with her soon. Impossible. Impossible, you. I'll give lessons tomorrow morning. Can't you forgive me for a while. Let me go to bed first and we'll go on to discuss it tomorrow night? Tell me, you. Come on, come on. I see our talk will lead to no results. You are now in anger. You won't believe whatever I say. What do you think of my suggestion? I'll move to the college to live for a few days and you stay at home alone to calm down. I'll think over what I've done and come back to you with our talk. Don't you agree? Hey, is it funny? Not at all. Don't be afraid. Please shave the upper part. Hey, this said of the neck. It'll be finished at once. OK Is it clean'? Clean. Clean. Let me have a look. Just a moment. Ready. Hey, hey. What are you to do? The ears cannot be dug everyday, really. No. Not good. Not smooth. Why did you pull down the curtain so quickly... Hmm? Did you? Tired. Tired? Yeah. Take a rest. Come over. Hug you. Don't go home, will you? Don't go home? Yeah. Stay here for the night? Will it do? Why not? NO. I'll go home, really. Today I have to go home. No. Ouch. Love me to death. Today I have to go home. NO. OK I'll put away the dishes. Come on. Collect the dishes. I'll put away the dishes. Hey. Hey. I'll following wherever you go. Open the door for me. To control me? I'll never be controlled. Get down. Excuse me, pass me a piece of paper. Hey. Yeah? It's too late, and I must be off now. No. What time is it by your watch? My watch doesn't work. Mine is OK. Yours is broken either. Don't leave and you must stay with me. I have to go, have to go. You make my head swim. Stay with me, please? No. Why not? No reason! Okay... eh? What are you doing? Don't hold me. I am too lonely. Really? Haven't you been alone all these years? It's different. Alas. Knocked your head? All right. All right. Will you stay a little longer? A little longer? Okay. OK. Glad? Very much. Are you happiest with me? Sure. That's right. It would be terrific if we stayed with each other all the time. Yes! Don't leave. Come on. Haven't I told you? I wouldn't like to be alone. Wait for a few days, OK? You're always breaking your promise. Never. You did just now. I have something to talk with you. What's it? I am pregnant. Really? Yeah. I went to be checked up the other day. Really? Yeah. Well, why didn't you tell me? I just knew it. How will you deal with this? What? What will you do with the baby? Hmm. Of course. Humph. What are you mumbling? Tell me! To be frank, it is a little troublesome now. I knew you would say that way. You know, I still have a lot of things unsettled in my family. How long will it take? Who knows? I don't know how long it will take. What if I can't solve this soon? I can wait for a short while, but not too long. I guess it won't be long. But I don't know exactly. What should I do, as the baby is growing bigger day by day? Yeah, it's troublesome. Ask yourself. What are you going to do with it? You see, just think of my family. You know the things in my family are too complicated. Every family has something difficult to deal with. Just listen to me. Zhou Lu Ning's company has poor profits. Neither mine. Things may go worse. It is possible that their company may be merged and she may be laid off. How will she, if we are divorced, how will she make a living? How to deal with my son? How to divide our house? There are so many problems to solve, aren't there? What's more, we can't solve this problem in one day. I have to settle them all. When can you make up your mind? It's not the problem when I can make up my mind, but I have to solve them step by step. How about me? Settle me down step by step? Yes, step by step. If you insist on having a baby, it will be more complicated. What do you think? Then divorce her. Yeah, as I have told you just now. That's to say, if I want to divorce, to get divorced, there are too many things to solve. Only after I settle down all the problems in my family can I feel at ease to be with you. I have to settle all the problems. It's not so easy. If I want to divorce, to divorce today, I can't get divorced tomorrow. Do you think it's easy? Then why did you choose to have an affair with me? Because I love you. Because you needn't to be responsible for me? That, that, what do you think of? What are you saying? Won't I be responsible for you? I don't believe you! Come on. Come on. What are you going to do? Fetch me a cigarette. Want to smoke? Yeah. Where is it? The lighter. Take it as ashtray? Is it convenient? I am serious. Me too. Don't you think I am serious? I asked for nothing before and. I know you have a family. But now it's different and you must say sorry to one of us. You say that you love me, so you should be responsible for me and take care of me. I really love you. But you see, I can let her down in feeling but I can't do so in economical matters. I should guarantee her a living for the rest of her life. Don't you think so? Then what am I? Your concubine? Nonsense, nonsense again. I am the same with her except that you married her first. Is there any difference? I am younger than her and I also have a baby. If you don't know how to say to her, I will go to talk with her, OK? No. Let me try. Let me try. Let us think it over first, shall we? Take it back. What for? Anyway, I want to have the baby and you can't change my mind. Did I ever try to persuade you? Why do I? Then, you need to make a good preparation. Your wife knows the affair, anyway. But she doesn't know you are pregnant. If she knows, she will give me hell. Aren't you afraid I'll give you hell? Don't laugh to me. Made up your mind? Why are you always laughing? The ultimatum? Yeah. Tian Jing, please, don't be angry. To tell you the truth, I'm not ready at all. If I want the baby to be born, I don't know what will happen. You know Let me think about it. Do you know what will happen if you don't want the baby? So I must think about both sides. And your wife knows this. Why can't you tell her? Well, Tian Jing, just think it over. If I tell Zhou Lu Ning about the baby, I must divorce her immediately, mustn't I? Yeah... But we've been living together for more than ten years. If you ask me to divorce her at once, resolutely and recklessly, I can't do that. You must give me time to re-adjust my feelings. What are you doing? I want to ring her. Leave me alone. What are you doing? Leave me alone, set me free. What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? Reckless. I'll tell her if you don't. Am I not explaining this to you all the time? You are silly. What for? I'll leave you alone. Get out. All right. Go to bed. Hello, Mr. Zhou is waiting for you at Room 2038. Thanks. Mr. Zhou. Hi. Brought you some health products today. Great. Especially this waist support. It's called static massage. It is very good for you. I used it before, and it makes me break wind. Really? That's right and it's got through. Got through? I can't shit. Really? Did you use this brand last time? I don't know. You can try it now. All right. All right. Is it OK. No, no, I don't want it. I'm sorry. Answer your phone, answer your phone. Hello, Ning Ning, what's the matter? Do you have a cold? Is our son all right? Yes, he is OK. I'd like to tell you that our factory is to be merged with the another one. And some will retire earlier, and others be transferred. Yeah, I want to discuss with you. How about meeting at the restaurant opposite the alley tomorrow morning? Okay. All right. I'll go there. Bye. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come and sit down. Miss, two cups of tea, please. Zhao Qian Kun has told me all your affairs. He's admitted his mistake. In fact, it's not easy for him. When he was a college student, I was at home with our little son. Those days were really bitter. But now things have just taken a turn for the better. However, let what's gone be gone. I think you are so young and so beautiful that you must marry a man more excellent than him. I think he is excellent enough. But he is married to me. I know. Have you discussed with him? How do you deal with your relationship? Anyway, he told me he had been wrong. So I ask you to come here to tell you about his attitude. Look, here he comes. Zhao Qian Kun, why are you so late. Zhao Qian Kun, tell her what you have said to me at home. Me or her, which one will you choose? Lu Ning, how can you think out of this? You arrange such an appointment, such a... If you have something to say, you can look for me or call me to go home, as you wish. Now you made such an appointment, don't you think it's embarrassing for all? Isn't it suitable? You, this is a public place. Then you tell me, doesn't what you said at home count? Didn't you say... I didn't say that. Well, you told me you were on impulse. Then you just tell her so. It's easy to put an end to impulse. Just tell her who you prefer. Lu Ning, let us talk at home, shall we? Zhao Qian Kun, but you said you want me. Did you cheat me? Don't think that way. He told me he had been on impulse. Who had been on impulse? He had been on impulse? He told me he had been on impulse. I think we should find a suitable place to talk about what can be discussed only at home or between you and me. Zhao Qian Kun, you can't treat me like this even if only for the sake of our son. Then what about our son, our son? I am pregnant with his son now. Zhao Qian Kun, is it true? Tell me. Is it true? A good taste? Is it laughable? Tian Jing, I have to say, you are eager for the fray! Why did you tell her about the baby? Don't be angry. It was not on purpose, I was just a little angry with you just now. You say nothing now. What are you going to do? What do you want me to say? Aren't you clear what I think? No, I'm not. You don't give a definite answer whenever I ask you. Who do you choose if you must make a choice? I want your answer right now. Emotionally I'll choose you. Tell me actually. I don't want your “emotionally”. Doesn't “emotionally” mean “actually”? Then can you live with me? Of course I will. What time? I need some time to solve this problem. But my baby can't wait. You can't be too selfish. I will solve it myself if you feel that I am not important for you. Please don't think like that. What I mean is if... Shut up. Tian Jing, I didn't mean that. I, in fact, I am truly... I see what's your attitude. I am not that important for you. I am going now. How are you? Thanks. Answer your phone. Answer your phone. I am very sorry. Recently something has gone wrong at home. Hello, it's me. Pardon? Where are you? Won't you? Wait for me, OK? Mr. Du, there is something urgent at home now. Yeah? Next time. I am really sorry. What are you writing? I'm waiting for you to sign it. Give me the pen. Sign here. Have a look at it! I'll go with her. Is she in danger? No, she isn't. Then what can I bring for her to eat? Black Chicken soup. Black Chicken Soup. Is just Black Chicken Soup? Excuse me, is there a woman named Tian Jing who has gone inside? She's got in. How long? Quite some time. Can you ask her to get out? No. You can only sit down and wait. Excuse me, did you also come to see Tian Jing? Yeah. I come to see Tian Jing too. I am her friend. Are you her family member? Her relative. I see. Are you her elder brother? Yes Her elder brother? No. Then, you are? Her, her cousin. Her cousin, are you her cousin? She has been inside for a long time. Have you ever met her boy friend? He's a bloody nuisance. He deserted her. Having an affair with her. In the present society, all kinds of persons exists. She said that man is a teacher. Humph! A teacher does this kind of thing. Don't you agree? Have you ever looked for him? Have your family looked for him? You should get him and make things clear for her. Just let it pass? Now she is in hospital like this but the man hasn't come here to look after her. Can he leave her alone? I think you should call him here, don't you think so? Elder brother? Do you need a hand? Anyway, Tian Jing and I are good friends. If you need my help, just let me know. I will go with you. What do you think? I don't think it's fair to end this carelessly, is it? How about this? We fix a time and go to look for the man together, shall we? This kind of thing! He does this kind of thing too irresponsibly. Don't you think so? At least, you should ask for a compensation in cash. We'll solve it as you wish. Right? There must be a settlement. I think that little girl has suffered too much losses, if we just let it be. She is a nice girl. We have been workmates for a long time. We keep no secrets from each other most of time. What is your job? What do you do? Do you work in the company or own a company? No, I don't. Because you are wearing a suit. I am also working at school. Well? Are you? Are also you a teacher? Yeah. Mr. Zhao, is it you? How did you know my family name? I know everything. I know everything between you and her. I just think... Mr. Zhao, you have heard what I said just now. Tian Jing and I are good friends, and we often talk with each other. I just think what you did is unfair to a young lady, isn't it? You are married, right? And you must do something for this thing, right? You either divorce your wife or do something else? You don't divorce with your wife, and you have an affair with Tian Jing. Do you think it is immoral for you to go on like this? I don't want to talk about this with you. No, No. Neither do I. We are just common friends. Mr. Zhao, I'm a rough guy, but you're a knowledgeable man, educated. Let's talk at ease, won't you? You are a teacher. Just judge it by yourself. How can you do this immoral thing? Eh? What do you think? Don't rattle on, will you? Am I rattling? I just want to talk with you at ease. Mr. Zhao, we are both men and there is nobody else here, so let us just have a casual talk. Do you think how to solve this? I told you it is none of your business, you know. Yeah, it's none of my business. So shut up. But we are friends. Stop, please. Tian Jing and I are good friends, very good friends and I am worried about her. Why can't we have a talk with each other? You and I are also acquaintances, aren't we? Don't go away! Don't go away! She is still inside, and we have to wait outside and do nothing. I know that it's embarrassing for you. It's difficult to face your wife. Have a child? Do you have a child? I told you to stop your rattling! I don't want to talk with you any more! Do you have a child, I just want to know? Do you? I won't want to talk with you any more. Ah, you have to answer me, do you have a boy or girl? You're a daddy now, but Tian Jing is unmarried yet. What will the others think of her? What I mean is, as a man, you'd better divorce your wife, do you agree? If you love her, you should take care of her. Don't you think so? What if this matter is told to your college and you're a daddy. How will you face your school leaders, your wife, and your child? You'll have terrible days to suffer. What the devil do you mean? Damn it! What do you mean? Damn it! What do you mean? If you are a real man, a capable man, stop to make clear. What do you want to do? Hey, what do you mean? Stop to talk with me clearly! You'd better be cautious. Don't move! Damn you! Shit, what a lousy knowledgeable man! Damn it! What's your plan? Stop! Stop! Fuck you! How was he sent to the hospital at that moment? The patient must lie flat on the back in this situation and don't let him stand straight. It's very dangerous for him to stand straight! Who is his family? I am. Now he is more clear-headed and you must talk with him. Wake him up every other ten minutes, so that he won't lapse into a coma. Is his life in danger? It depend. How much? Three. And this? Five. What is your surname? Zhao. Well, do you know this woman? Now he is in a stable condition and you must talk with him. Don't let him be in a coma. I see. There is nothing else. Well, you can make that drip a little faster. His blood stress is normal now, so it's not critical. Ouch, what smell? He lost control over his urine. Please change the potholder for him. Don't move too rudely. Be careful. Excuse me, doctor, isn't he dangerous? Don't worried about him too much. But you must be well prepared that the patient needs to be watched for some time in the hospital. Let's go outside. Zhao Qian Kun? Don't fall asleep! OK? Don't fall asleep! Qian Kun, can you hear me? Are you feeling hurt? Hey. Qian Kun, talk with me. Zhao Qian Kun? Zhao Qian Kun? ...Don't fall asleep. The water is boiling. Does Tang Wei live here now? Room 316. Nobody is there. No one? Let me have a look. Tang Wei! Tang Wei! I've knocked on the door quite a while, but there is no answer. Well, perhaps she's gone out. Then you, you're... Nothing special, I just drop in on her and I'll wait here. How about waiting in my room? No, thanks. Hi, how are you! Why do you sit here? I'm waiting for her. Well, take my advice. Come and wait in my room. It doesn't matter. That's too troublesome. I think he'll be back soon. Come here. Come here. It must be too troublesome. Not at all. Tang Wei and I get along well. Be at home. Let me carry it. Come in. Come in, please. My room is at sixes and sevens. Make yourself at home, will you? I tell you what. Tang Wei's husband, Lao Li, and I are in the same department. We have been working together for many years and we are familiar with each other, so don't feel troublesome at all. You can go on doing your business and let me alone, and I am here to wait for her. Would you like to dry yourself with a towel? Take it by yourself. I've brought one. I will do it by myself. It is raining hard outside. You are wet all over, but there aren't suitable clothes for you here. It doesn't matter. I've brought here. All right, you can change your clothes here and I'll go outside with the door closed. Is that OK? Quite OK. I will pull the curtain down by the way. Take care. OK. You can change your clothes here. Thanks a lot. You're welcome. Well, I'm OK. Sit down, please. Come and have a cup of tea. Thanks. You are busy with yourself and just let me alone. Are you from the other place? I'm from Bang Bu, An Hui Province. It takes a long time to get here by train, doesn't it? More than eight hours. I went to Ning Bo to attend a meeting and just drop in here. You have been to Ning Bo and the meeting is ended? Yeah. I come here to drop in on Tang Wei. Tang Wei and you are... Classmates in college. Did she graduate from He Hai University in Nan Jing? Yes, she did. Where are you now? I'm working for Beng Bu Tap Water Factory. Lao Li, and you in the same department? Yeah. In the surgical department of the traditional Chinese medical science. You have many musical instruments here. Well, they belong to the Workers' Union. This was the reference room before, but later it was moved to a new place, so the odds and ends are left here. Aren't you assigned a bedroom? Do you live here? I'm writing something these two days. Just for the time being. How is their daughter Guo Guo? I've bought a bear toy for her. Buy it just now? I haven't seen her for years. She's as old as my daughter. Really? Have you seen her daughter? Yes, I have. I received her photo. About three years ago, at a meeting. She was a very little girl at that time and she was still held in arms. Now she grows taller. Really? Tang Wei is very capable and she sells, er, cosmetics, I don't know its brand. It's a direct sale and she does it very well. She can make a lot of money a month. She did that at the college. Really. She was in the Youth League branch. You do your own things. It doesn't matter. I am OK. Is it your first time to Shanghai? I came to Shanghai at the age of seven or eight. Not after that. Well, great changes have taken place in Shanghai these years! Ask Tang Wei to show you around tomorrow. I'll leave tomorrow. What a pity! I beg your pardon? What? Qian Kun. Qian Kun, are you calling me? Qian Kun, Qian Kun, what did you say? What? He asked me to make match for you. Make match? Isn't your fate good enough? I am requested. So I came to ask whether you would like or not. You can answer me after you think it over. Are you kidding? No. I am serious. I tell you it is only kidding. Don't you think how old is her younger sister? It is sixteenth birthday today. Weren't you sixteen when I left? Why did nobody made match for us? What you said implies that a 16-year-old girl can get married, right? Do you agree on this proposal? No. I tell you I don't. Are you satisfied? Yiwen, I beg you not to press me more. Don't torment me any more, please. I had enough. I regret why I didn't find a matchmaker. Why, why didn't you know? Didn't you agree at first? I did at first. Why not?... Because your mother disagreed. But my mother is dead now. But you are married. Is it good if Li Yan marries her younger sister to you? I was contradictory. I didn't want to go with you. I seldom come here. Let's go to dance. No, no. Let's go. Do you believe I was a thief once. The book describes how she goes into a bookstore, how she fosters her will of stealing book, then how she makes up her mind and how she gets the book. It is very specific and vivid. After I read that book, I thought I should have this courage. It was not the volume of the book but the courage that prevailed over myself. I should learn to do what I dared not do before. Then I went to the Xin Hua Bookstore to steal a book. Did you ever do misdoings? Ahhh, of course. Tell me. Too many of them. Which aspect do you want to listen to? The worst one. The most shocking. Let me see, let me see. Have recalled one? I am still thinking of the film we just saw. Pardon? I am still thinking of the film we just saw. Great, you are a good dancer. I feel a little dizzy. You dance very well. Tang Wei is back. I am going over. OK. I'll put your wet clothes in this bag. You needn't go over, and myself is OK. So, I won't. Well, can you manage it? I can. Thank you very much. Don't mention it. I was very glad indeed. Please come to Beng Bu and see me whenever you are free. OK. Goodbye. Bye, Bye. Is this one yours? Please get on the train. OK. Here you are. Thanks. Put it on the luggage rack. I'll do it later. This is my phone number. Do you often go to Ning Bo for meetings? Hey, come over. Do you like to get along with me the way we did last night? Be careful on the way. Goodbye. Zhao Qian Kun. I'll go upstairs, and you're here to accompany our son. You son? Yeah. Qian Kun? Qian Kun? I have sorted through your staffs, please come with me. Son, please come to give me a hand. Have a good look at your father. OK. Go to have a look, those all are your staffs. This is Zhou Quan Kun's office, please leave your message. Hello, Zhou Quan Kun, how are you? Can you guess who I am, and can you recognize my voice? I've arrived in Bengbu. I had a great day that day. Thank you very much. Please come here to see me whenever you get a chance. I wish to see you again. Bye-bye. I'll call later. Good luck very day. That's all. Bye bye.
