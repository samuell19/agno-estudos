[Hiccup] [Hiccup] [Hiccups continue] Greetings, Your Highness. This is a new medication I concocted, praying to Lord Dhanvantari. This will cure you. Greetings, Your Highness. I'm sparing no effort to bring physicians who are even more proficient. Who are you, sir? O' great Lord, I am just your servant. The one you blessed with the post of the Chief Minister, your humble servant, Veerabhadran. Do you know who I am, Chief Minister? Are you testing me, Your Majesty? You are the glorious King, His Highness Mahaveera Ugrasena Maharaja of the country of Manomaya. Who doesn't know that in the whole world? Who is this, with you? My wife, Parimalam. One among your subjects. You had ordered that you wanted to see her. Wait at the resting area. I need to talk to the Chief Minister, in private. Please tell me what I should do for you. I am ready to sacrifice even my life for you. -More physicians? -No! No more physicians! I... I need a girl. A beautiful girl. To sleep peacefully, I need a celestial beauty. All the beautiful girls in the country are already in your harem. They are as beautiful as celestial nymphs. I suspect whether you have even seen all of them. As beautiful as celestial nymphs? Who's that? -Queen Suhasini? -Aargh! Round nose... ...and dry cheeks. Is that how nymphs are? Queen Nandini? No way! Flat feet, droopy eyes. Pardon me. Earlier, when you had gone for the Chandragiri festival, you saw a beautiful girl called Mythili, whom Lord Devadattan was about to give away in marriage, and felt attracted to her. Holding the entire family of the Lord who stood against your wish at sword's point, it was I who brought Queen Mythili to your harem. Back then, you had told me that... there is no one who can beat Queen Mythili who's as beautiful as a marble sculpture, in heaven, hell or earth! It's true. I had said that. Mythili Devi looks visually appealing from a distance. But... her voice and expressions do not have even a semblance of feminity. A soulless marble sculpture may look good, but what use does it have? I'm not particular about getting a virgin. You can... ...find a girl among people's wives too. But... ...she should be as beautiful as I described. She should have all the attributes and qualities I mentioned. There are no one with beautiful wives... Stop! I will give you a week's time, Minister. Before your time is over, you should return to the palace. And along with you, there should be a girl who can challenge the five senses with her voice, taste, form, smell and touch. A girl with a soul as pure as the spike of a basil plant. You may leave now, Chief Minister.

I got scared, all of a sudden. I'm on my way to deliver milk to the co-operative society. I haven't seen you here earlier. Why did you call me? This body is feeling thirsty, my dear. There's a pipe over there, Swami. It's drinking water. [Chanting a Sloka] What does that mean? I am unable to get up or walk. Immobile! What should I do for you, Swami? If you give me a vessel, I'll bring water from the pipe. Isn't it milk in your vessel? Yes. But it's unskimmed milk. That's fine, Babukutta. Why should I have a problem then? Here you go. I don't mind some blessings, Swami. Can you hold this vessel? Should I? Of course. What did you mix in the milk, Swami? Shall I give you some sacrament too? If you ask me so... Pour some more. Wow! Is it for me, Swami? Please bless me, Swami. Bless me! Swami! What's your name, Swami? This materialistic world... calls me Sage Apoornnanantha. Apoornna (incomplete)? What does that mean? Incompleteness is the journey from emptiness to fullness. Are you on a journey, Swami? Where are you going, Swami? Sometimes to the future, sometimes to the past. Sometimes forward, sometimes backward. [chanting prayers] [indistinct chatter] What's happening here? He's the one who climbed Mount Kailasa, barefoot. A great ascetic! He was giving sermons in Sanskrit, all this while. He is meditating now. Babukuttan saw him first. He became the Swami's disciple and surrendered himself at his feet. If this hermit builds an Ashram in our town, this town will prosper! He's a young sage. There's an aura around him. I have been planning a Himalayan trip for a long time. We should hold a welcoming function for the Swami, on behalf of the Devotees' committee, and make him conduct a religious sermon too. I will arrange everything. The temple is about to open. I will be back after offering prayers. Aren't you coming? Priest, a Swami has come here from the Himalayas. He's a great ascetic, apparently. That's amazing. If someone like that comes before the festival commences, it's a good omen. I got a little late. I shall meet him once I open the temple. O' Lord Hanuman! -Namaste, Swami. What is this? Please come quickly! All of you, please come quickly! The deity is missing! The roof tiles have been removed! Some bloody thief has stolen the Lord's idol! The roof tiles have been removed. The Lord's idol has been stolen! Who did this? Bloody thief! Lord Hanuman! Our God is missing! He is not here. Please come quickly. [people howling] Move aside! Move! Shut up! Good morning, sir. Good morning, Jeeva. What's happening there? The idol is here under the banyan tree. The Thrikkannapuram idol robbery case... ...has not been solved for three years. This guy must have done that too. Ask around and try to frame him for that too. Sir, don't we need a recovery? How can we do it without finding the idol? You just have to arrange some melted metal from somewhere, right? I'll try, sir. When you prepare the recovery note, write that the idol was found in his possession. Also, add four or five witnesses as well. Strong witnesses. I'll do that, sir. I'll call you once I finish writing the recovery note, sir. Good morning, sir. I had a hunch as soon as I saw him... ...that he's a fake hermit. Just that I didn't say it out loud then. Now, the cops will take him and extract the truth. How can he take my Lord away, just like that? Long back, at a Hanuman temple, a similar trickster landed up. I heard that someone threw him away, using his tail. I needn't say who that is, right? Oh Lord Hanuman! Swami! You didn't complete the story of the King, the Minister and the beautiful girl. The King will come. The Minister will, too. Everything that has to be destroyed will be destroyed in every era. And they shall be created in the next era. [chanting Slokas] A thief in a sage's attire! What all do we have to witness, oh God! It's the era of conflicts, Priest. Anything is possible. Even Lord Brahma cannot stop the era of conflicts, right? No wonder. People like him are around, right? That's true. Look at him going! As if he has won some election! [Toilet Flushes] Maintenance case, 12/2019 Complainant, Chandrika. Defendant, Sugunan. Your Honour, he hasn't paid her alimony for eight months. And so, the warrant may be issued. Paying the entire arrears today itself. The total amount owed, Rs. 24,000, shall be paid today itself. Are you paying the money now? Yes, sir. I've brought the money. I'll give it. Go ahead then. What's in this sack? It's money, sir. Rs. 24,000. Count it and give me a receipt. You've brought loose change? Yes, sir. Your Honour! This... Who's going to count coins worth Rs.24,000? I've counted it, sir. She keeps a count of everything I do in life. Let her count it. If there's anything missing, I'm ready to pay it. Bloody monster! He's doing this deliberately, sir! I am an asthma patient. I can't carry weights. Didn't you see how he himsef was struggling to carry that sack? I want the alimony as notes, sir. Sir, this money was not printed by my father or me at my house. It was issued by the Government. Sir, I haven't received alimony for eight months. I have been doing rounds of this court for so many times! Sir, it's true that I haven't paid alimony for eight months. I agree. But, she should at least enquire whether I was alive for the past eight months, right, sir? Ask him if he enquired whether my children and I were alive, sir! I feed my children, working as a labourer. You're going on talking about the children! These children were not born out of banana shoots! They are my children, right? Hey! Use your words carefully. Don't use the language you speak at home, in the court. The court has its own dignity and decorum. Understood? I'd have lost 500 bucks now. Your Honour, my client cannot be troubled like this. I'm not ready for it. I can only order that the alimony should be paid. But there's no section in the law, to order that it should paid as notes. Coins have not been banned, right? He broke my back while we were living together, sir. I cannot sit down and count all these coins. He knows that. He's doing this deliberately, sir. I cannot count this, sir. I cannot! If she cannot count it, I can't give it without counting. I won't leave until I get a receipt after this is counted. If she can't count it, I can't give it without counting. You'll die with the bite of a rabid dog! Damn it! Hey! Sir! Count all those coins and confirm the amount. Oops. That shot hit elsewhere! What is this, man? Broke a piggy bank? What do I say, sir? I asked for unnecessary trouble. Count it properly then. Though it's late, here's wishing you Good Morning! Good morning. CC 730/2020. Sir, keep all the ₹1 coins together and the ₹2 coins together. It will be easier to stack the ₹5 and ₹10 coins separately, right? There are no ₹5 or ₹10 coins, sir. Most are ₹1 coins. With the intention of seducing a 61 year old man who was on a bus, she exposed herself and showed sexual gestures. This was seen by police officers who are witnesses, and she has committed a crime as per Section 8 of the IT act. Do you admit to the crime? No! No! Here you go! You may step down. Give your signature before leaving. Call the next case. CC 257/2020 Accused, Apoornnananthan. Witnesses, CW 1 to 4. Damodaran Potti, Kaladevi, Babukuttan, Jagjeevan. All witnesses present. Are you ready? Yes. Call the first witness. CW1 Damodaran Potti. The rest of you can wait outside. I swear in the name of God that I shall state only the truth in the court. I swear in the name of God that I shall state only the truth in the court. Where is your advocate? Honourable Court, I don't have an advocate. I shall fight the case myself. Okay. Chief! What's your occupation? I am the High Priest at Melkavu Hanuman temple. You're aware of everything that happened, right? I am. Explain it in detail. I stay near the Melkavu Hanuman temple. On 02.01.2020, when I reached the temple at dawn, as usual, within the temple premises.. Hello! Hello! Say it slowly. The Judge needs to write it down. As I was going to the temple, I saw a crowd outside the temple. When I checked, a person dressed like a hermit was sitting under the Banyan tree. Since it was time for me to open the temple, I went into the temple, after having a quick glance at him. When I opened the sanctorum of the temple... Oh my God! My God was missing from there! After some time, the idol was found from the bag of the hermit under the Banyan tree. And then? The police recorded my statement, prepared the recovery note, arrested the thief and took him with them. Can you identify the accused? Yes. Is he anywhere among this crowd? He is standing there. Did you reclaim the idol that the police recovered, upon an agreement? I did. There's daily worship at the temple. Give me that photo. Can you identify the idol? This is the idol's photo. I can identify it even in the middle of my sleep. My Lord Hanuman! My God! Photograph may be marked as P1. That's all, Your Honour. Cross! If you have something to ask this witness, you may. How long has it been since you started performing religious rites, Priest? As soon as I completed my religious education. So, you must be well aware of invocations and spells! I won't get an opportunity to worship this renowned deity of Lord Hanuman, otherwise. What is the psalm of Lord Hanuman? It's not appropriate to chant the psalm to clear someone's confusion, in public. Chanting the base spell may be inappropriate. Anyone can chant the psalm, right? [chanting the psalm] Yeah! Is it "Anjana chandanam veeram" or "Anjana nandanam veeram"? Anjana Devi's Nandanan... That means, her son, the mighty Hanuman. Isn't that how it is, Priest? I have heard people chanting it that way too. [chanting another psalm] Isn't it? Are you playing Antakshari (musical game)? Or is it a Sloka competition? Recitation contest! Where do you stay, sir? At the temple monastery. You must be staying alone, right? I have my family with me. By family, you mean? The one in my house and my children. I mean, my wife and children. It is hence proved that the Lord left the temple, since he lost his vitality. Because, the priest is not celibate. Are you saying that Lord Hanuman's idol went and sat under the Banyan tree on its own? In Godly matters, miracles have happened. There is evidence for idols travelling. There is evidence of appearance and disappearance of idols. There is evidence for idols drinking milk. There are idols that came into existence on their own. Those are all myths. Stories that have no solid proof. As far as a devotee is concerned, faith is more important. You can counter the witness' statement in the court. You can list the evidence for that. You stepped out, seeing that the idol was missing from the sanctorum, and saw the idol near me. That's what you said. Yes. How far was the idol from the place I was sitting? It was this far. What are you saying? Was it that far? Let him speak, sir. Almost this much. It was this far. What's the measurement? Must be around two metres. You mean two feet, right? Objection, Your Honour. Answers shall not be given to the witness. The witness said, two metres. Measure the distance. Please permit me to watch the measurement closely. -Your Honour! -I object! It will cause inconvenience to the witness. He may intimidate or influence the witness. No! Let him come and cross-examine. That's his right. You may measure it. Sir, 1.65 metres. 1.65 metres. So, it's close to 2 metres. So, it is 5.4 feet. This nobleman said that it was 2 feet. He is not competent to gauge the distance. Accused made him confused. Potti, if you're not sure of something, you can say that you don't know it, to the court. Okay. Nobleman, huh? Don't think that I didn't understand your connotation. You're lucky that we're in the court. If you've confirmed the measurement, you can go back. Okay. Any more questions? Length, width and height. He saw the idol only as a solid with these three dimensions. It is because he's unable to see the fourth dimension of the idol, which is time, and the fifth dimension, which is spirituality, he is saying that the idol was stolen. I suggest so. Sir, how's it going? It's around 11:30 AM. Shut up, you two. Don't disturb me. Sorry, sir. Call the next witness. CW2 Kaladevi. I swear in the name of God that I shall state only the truth in court. In the name of Lord Hanuman, and the Lord of Palani, I swear, that I shall state only the truth in court. Repeat what I said. I should be swearing in the name of the God I believe in, right? [praying] Are you done praying? I'm done. Are you aware of the incidents that led to this case? What a question! Should I come all the way here to talk about something I don't know? You may explain it then. I am going to explain. Every morning, if the clock strikes four, I will wake up then, and prepare an oil concoction with various invigorating herbs, and rest for half an hour after applying it on my hair. And then, I will bathe in the water I collected the previous day and change my clothes. You must be wondering why my hair is short, even after applying all that oil. Don't take this into account. I shaved my head when we took my grandson to Palani for his first meal. Understood? It has been only three months. See how much it has grown! If you had done all this, you wouldn't have lost your hair, sir. Forget about the oil. Come to the point. What happened on that day? I am coming to that. Sir... On 02.01.2020, as usual, after finishing all my chores, I milked the goat and made tea for my husband, chanted the morning prayer, and opened the chicken coop. By then, it was 5 AM. PP! I am helpless! Shall I continue? Yeah, yeah! The incident alone! Keep it short, please. I'm coming to that. Even on that morning, I finished all my chores at home as usual, and like all other days, I went to the temple. The Priest brought the oil and wicks, lit the lamp and entered inside the temple. What I heard next was a loud scream! "Oh my God!" The priest said that the Lord's idol was missing. Finally, the idol was found from the bag of the hermit who was sitting outside. Even then, that fake hermit was sitting as if nothing happened, with a fake beard and fake prayer beads. This hermit you're talking about... Is he here? He's not a hermit. He's a termite! There he is. It's that fellow! I will never forget that face, even if I see him at midnight. Even if I see someone just once, I will never forget his face. Be it a thief or a scoundrel, or an Advocate or a Judge! I will never forget the face. That's how I am. Anything else? Nothing, nothing. Cross! You called me a fake hermit, right? How will you identify an original hermit from a fake one? What else can I call someone who steals the Lord's idol? Did you see me stealing the idol? I didn't see him stealing the idol. But I saw him with the stolen idol. Did the people catch him and say all that for nothing? You were the President of the Devotees' committee, in 2018 and 2019, right? I am the President even now. In 2018, while you were the President of the Devotees' committee , as part of the special occasion of the foundation day of the temple, didn't you get caught for embezzling money during the purchase of ceremonial objects? Who told you so? Well, people even stuck posters declaring you as a culprit. Well, well! If some random people say something, or stick posters, will it become true? So, you don't have the opinion that everything that people say, is the truth? It's true that the people caught you with the idol. That's not how it is, in my case. You bloody thief! Keep your tricks to yourself! Honourable Court, she is calling me a 'Thief'. You should take action. What else should I call you? Let's call him a Saint. I swear! Well, don't call him a thief. The court is still hearing the case. Do you have anything else to ask her? No. Any re? No re. How did he get so many coins? It's the result of my hard work for eight months, sir. Each of those coins has the salt of my hard work. What kind of hard work? I was sitting at the bus stand's toilet counter. Get lost! CW3 Babukuttan. Namaste. I swear in the name of God, that I shall state only the truth in court. I swear in the name of God, that I shall state only the truth in court. What's your occupation, Babukuttan? I do farming and cow rearing, sir. Are you aware of this incident? -I am. -You may speak then. Actually, on 02.01.2020, at dawn, I was passing in front of the temple, on my way to deliver milk to the co-operative society. That's when someone called me "Young man". So, I drank the sacrament that Swami gave me, in a single gulp. What happened after that? After that, my 'birds flew away', sir. -Huh? -Huh? Birds flew away? Yes, sir. It has been a while since my birds flew away! What do you mean by 'birds flew away'? By 'birds flew away', I mean... the birds within us... It feels like all of them are flying out of us. You understood what I meant, right? So, you mean... ... it's like an intoxicated state after consuming drugs? Objection! Prosecutor should not give leading answers. Well, what should I write in this now? Can you explain it in a language which the Judge can write down? Many butterflies and fireflies appeared. If he has seen butterflies, it must be some high-grade stuff. Then, several colours appeared around me. Swami was going on narrating a story then. I felt like my legs were getting paralyzed. What about Swami? What state was he in? Swami would also be in a similar state as mine, right? He was consuming this stuff intermittently. Your Honour, the monk was also intoxicated. Is this person whom you're talking about, present in this court? He is standing in that dock, sir. That's all, Your Honour. Cross. On the day the incident occured, if I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have seen me. No. When you came near me, did you see the idol in my possession? I didn't notice it then. After that, I consumed the marijuana paste which Swami gave me, and became like that, right? What you consumed, was the sacrament of Lord Thryamabakeshwara, who lives in graveyards. After having a spoonful of that, you rose up from the worlds of Vitala, Sutala, Talatala and Rasatala, and travelled to the world of Mahatala. Unable to bear the power of that divine sight, your physical body collapsed. I suggest so. How do I write all this? What can we say? He has come after consuming some high-grade stuff! By Thrayambakeshwaran, you mean Lord Shiva, right? He consumed Shiva's sacrament and got intoxicated. Can I write it like that? Yes, that's enough. Anything else? I suggest that you haven't seen the idol in my possession, and what I gave you was not marijuana paste, and you are giving a false statement as per the instructions from the police. Why are you being scared? Speak! Well, I am scared whether I'll be cursed. There are no curses here. Honourable Court, the accused is spreading superstitions, and scaring the witness. Your can keep your spells, curses and beliefs, outside the court. If you have something logical to state here, please go ahead. [chanting prayers] I think he's swearing. You can speak aloud. There have been mighty Kings who have questioned the very existence of God! As a result of a severe and wrathful curse for that grave sin, that country and its seven future generations, have been destroyed completely. The thrones of justice that argued that what's unseen does not exist, have been uprooted. Can breath be seen? Can electricity be seen? If you are sure that you are strong enough to watch and withstand it, say that it is a lie! O' son of the wind! O' Lord Hanuman! Okay! Next witness. Please don't curse me, Swami. CW4, Jagjeevan, CI of Police. I swear in the name of God, that I shall state only the truth in court. I swear in the name of God, that I shall state only the truth in court. You may speak. I am the SHO of Mariyapuram police station. On 02.01.2020, a person was found under suspicious circumstances around 5:30 AM, within Melkavu temple premises, and was held there by the townspeople, and the idol went missing from the adjacent temple. Upon receiving this information, I reached the above-mentioned temple's compound to investigate, and saw that the people had held a hermit dressed in saffron, and in the search that followed, I realized beyond doubt, that the idol was missing from the temple, and the above-mentioned had stored it in his custody to smuggle it away, I arrested the above-mentioned in the morning. While searching, I recovered a black coloured substance in a paste form, from a steel bowl in his first bag. When the substance found in the bowl was smelled, it was speculated to be marijuana paste, and thus, it was sealed and taken into custody. Isn't this the steel bowl you recovered on that day? Yes, this is the one. May be marked as MO1. Following that, since the temple officials claimed that the stolen idol has to be used for daily worship, I sought the help of fingerprint experts, undertook the procedures to lift the fingerprints, clicked a photo of this idol, and returned the idol to the first witness. This is the recovery note you prepared for this case. Yes. It has the my signature along with people who were present there. May be marked as P2. I completed the investigation and submitted the charge-sheet. The accused whom you arrested... He is standing in the accused dock. Okay. Anything else? No, Your Honour. Okay. Cross. From the bus stand near Melukavu temple, the first bus leaves at 5 a.m. in the morning. Do you know that? Yes. If I had come there to commit a robbery, I would have taken the bus at 5 a.m. CW3 has given his statement that I called him towards me. There are many instances in which thieves have fallen asleep after the robbery. Here, the accused was intoxicated with marijuana, and in a condition in which he couldn't travel. That's mentioned in the third witness' statement. And I had seen it in person too. If so, did you find the presence of marijuana, in the blood of the third witness and me? By the time the procedures were completed, it was noon. So, we couldn't detect the presence of drugs. To detect it immediately, you could have tested the saliva using a rapid detection kit. Stop taking classes for the police, and ask what you want to ask. After doing a fingerprint test on the idol, did you find my fingerprint on it? Even before the test.. You can explain after saying yes or no. No. Since the people and the priest had touched the idol before the FP test, there were multiple fingerpints and untraceable fingerprints. Was the idol inside the bag or outside? Townspeople had kept the idol outside the bag, after examining it. So, you have not seen the idol in my exclusive possession, and that you haven't seen the idol inside the bag. I suggest so. From the witness statements.. State what you saw. The witness statements cannot be recorded as evidence. He is stating the inference of his investigation. But 162 CRPC does not recognize it as evidence. Yes, yes. He's right. You should answer his question. I haven't seen it. Did you find any kind of biological or physical evidence which belongs to me, from the sanctorum? Have you? -No. -No. There is no evidence to prove that I have stolen the idol, apart from the witness statements. Isn't that right? I have learned that he has fought his own cases, after robbing the idols from several temples in North India. Do you have documented proof? I am collecting documented proof. Objection, Your Honour. This statement shall not be recorded. Why not? He is stating the modus operandi of the accused. The CI is not stating it as modus operandi, but as bad conduct. That's not relevant, as per Section 53, evidence act. Yes, yes. He's got a point in it. Do you have a degree in law? Or did you learn all this by fighting your own cases? I don't have a degree in law, Honourable Court. That's all he was lacking! Carry on. When you saw it, how far away was the idol from me? It was in nearest proximity. What's your definition of nearest proximity? The distance by which we can identify under whose possession an object is in. Honourable Court, please allow me to come forward, once again. Yes, of course. This book, placed on the right side of the Prosecutor's table. Whom does it belong to? This book might belong to the advocate who was sitting here earlier. But who is sitting in the nearest proximity of this book? I mean, under whose possession is this book now? Well, well! The accused is marking me for evidence. The accused is asking irrelevant questions and wasting time. Prosecutor has evaded my question about possession. The one who's sitting in nearest proximity of this book, is the Prosecutor. So, is it under your possession? When the laws in the book are interpreted, you should listen to the opposite side, as well. Someone who's not a 'Choran', or someone who's not a thief, may be seen on the path of the thief. Though he was not a thief, fearing a severe torture, Mandavya stated that he was a thief. He's a perfect example. So, a person should be punished only if all the evidence is proved to be true. Ignoramuses, youngsters, the aged, the afflicted, persons suffering from hunger, thirst or fatigue from journey. It is said in the book of law that such people shall not be punished. Where is this said in our book of law? In Kautilya's Artha Shastra, the fourth book, 'Removal of thorns', the 83rd part, "Examination by word of mouth and action thereon", of the eighth chapter, says so. What nonsense is he talking? King and monarchy, it seems. That book which was written about royal governance in ancient times.... What relevance does it have today? Not relevant! Is monarchy, power, slavery, robbery and exploitation, exclusive to ancient times? You can still see with your eyes and hear with your ears. Can't you, Prosecutor sir? Call His Highness' case. Case no. 260, year 1783 of the Indian national calendar. Along with presidency court reference no.1, and counter case from the palace. Complainant Krishnanunni, and the defendant is His Highness Sri Rudramahaveera Ugrasena Maharaja. The second defendant is Chief Minister Veerabhadran. Counter-case complainant, His Highness, represented by Palace Secretary. Defendants are Devayani Unni and Chief Minister. Yes. Your Honour, Shouldn't the accused be present at the dock? I hope we can follow the usual procedure. Your Honour, is it compulsory that His Highness should stand in the accused dock? We are asking the Princely State to enter into the accused dock, and I strongly object! Counsel, you can consult His Highness... ...whether he's willing to follow the normal court procedure. Your Honour, His Royal Highness is ready to follow the rules of the court. Good. [chanting a Sloka] A King who serves justice, should be pure at heart, should think scientifically, and obey the law. This is a rare occurence. I must say, totally unprecedented. In the history of this court, a King's trial has not been conducted till date, upon a subject's complaint, in this country. It is only because there's an order from the Chief Justice of Presidency Court, and because His Highness expressed his consent to appear, that this trial is happening here now. And thus, the normal proceedings of a regular case, may not be followed as a custom, at this instance. Yet, the administration of justice cannot be avoided, as well. So, all of you should co-operate. Call the witness. First witness, Krishnanunni. In the name of God and the mighty King, I swear that I shall state only the truth in court. In the name of God and the Mighty King, I swear that I shall state only the truth in court. Proceed. Why have you filed the complaint? Explain it in detail. My house is on the eastern side of Chithrapuri village. I work as a flower-seller at Kunninmukalilappan Temple, in the village. I have a daughter. Her name is Devayani. My wife died due to an illness, when my daughter was one year old. I had dedicated my entire life after that, for my daughter. On the day of the incident... The King has ordered me to bring your daughter to the royal court. Ask your daughter to get ready for the journey. I felt as if I was paralyzed. I had heard that... ...the King had more than 2000 wives. The King abducts all the girls in the country, makes them his wives and keeps them in his harem. I have heard that... ... it is the Minister who does all this for the King. I begged to the Chief Minister, not to take my daughter away. I fell at his feet. And then? I went to the palace, looking for my daughter. The guards didn't let me go inside. Not knowing what to do, I kept wandering. And when I felt weak and fell unconscious at some place, a hermit sprinkled water on my face and woke me up. And then he told me that there is a capital for all the provinces, and that I shall get my daughter back, if I file a complaint at the court there. Finally, I came out of my province. I reached the capital of the country. I filed a complaint at the Presidency Court. She told me that the King tortured almost dead, sir. her till she was You just have to let us live, sir. Please let us live. Can you identify the person who took your daughter away by force? I can. Is he anywhere in this court? Yes. He is standing on the left side of the dock. Your Honour, witness has identified the accused. That's all, Your Honour. Cross-examination. You said that your daughter was kidnapped, right? This person who supposedly kidnapped her... Was he wearing the upper cloth with a royal seal on it? Yes. So, you understood that the person who came there was a superior official of the country. I did. I suggest that your daughter was taken legally for a general necessity of the country. I'm not aware of that. Anyway, the event that your daughter was presented to the King, and the event that she was tortured by the King, are not incidents that you have seen in person. It is hearsay from what my daughter said. Your daughter began hallucinating after seeing the royal palace and surroundings. I suggest that she was lying. Objection! This is a scandalous quesiton. It was something spoken by the victim, to her father. My friend... ...should realize that hearsay evidence is not admissible in our legal system. I don't understand how someone can give evidence against a person, based on hearsay? We will discuss the legal points later. Upon whose instruction did you file a complaint against the King? A young hermit. Can you identify him if you see him? I don't remember his face correctly. How did you realize that he was a hermit? I suggest that he was a spy of the neighbouring country, an enemy of our country. Oh no! Never! Why should I do that? A great sage, a thief dressed up as a sage, spies dressed as sages, or beggars... are all different. Certain people who are consipiring against the royal rule and the mighty King gave you gold and money, and made you file a complaint at the capital, and committed treachery to the country. I suggest so. No answer. That's all, Your Honour. Cross-examination for the minister. Who is appearing for the minister? I am appearing for the minister, Your Honour. Any cross? No further cross, Your Honour. Any re? No re. This is not right. This is not right! "In the happiness of subjects lies the happiness of the King, and in the welfare of public lies his welfare." This is not right. You are really talented, Swami. No one can fight in court like this. Everyone can. Can I do it too? -You can. -How? You should learn the Kundalini spell. I shall learn it. You should awaken the Kundalini (coiled snake). I shall awaken it. You can teach me, Swami. [chanting] Call the next witness. CW2 Gopi Kishan. In the name of God and the mighty King, I swear that I shall state only the truth in court. In the name of God and the mighty King, I swear that I shall state only the truth in court. Proceed. What's your occupation? I am a singer. I sing at the temple. Where is your house? In the village of Chithrapuri. Do you know Krishnanunni who gave his witness statement in this court? -I do. -How do you know him? Uncle Krishnanunni's house is near my house. Do you remember what happened on the day the incident occured? Yes. You can say it. I was late to wake up that morning. There was a concert at the temple, on the previous night. That day.... His eyes are so radiant. I couldn't even look into his eyes. Will he be the commander-in-chief of the army? -What? -You've woken up? What were you saying? Someone came on a horse, to the junction. Someone who had a special aura. And? He was asking for directions to the Kunnumpurathappan temple. He has gone there. While running to the temple, my mind was disturbed. I ran and reached the temple. If you look from there, you can see Devayani's house. What I feared the most, happened. -Who are you? -Move away. Imbecile! Whom do you think you are opposing? Close your eyes! Or I'll gouge them out. You can gouge my eyes. Set Devayani free. I couldn't do anything. Anything at all. Abducting Devayani, the minister went away. Even otherwise, what could I have done? Are you familiar with this necklace? Yes. When I tried to stop the minister, his necklace fell over there. I kept it safely as an evidence. May be marked as MO1. Can you identify the man who kidnapped Devayani? -Yes. -Is he here? It's the man who's standing on the left side of the dock. That's all, Your Honour. Cross-examination. When you were told that a man on a horse left from there, why did you run to Devayani's house? No one goes in that direction usually. There is nothing precious to steal, in that entire area. The most precious.... ...was Devayani. What's your relation to Devayani? I've been in love with Devayani since childhood. But I haven't told this to Devayani yet. That's why you went running to Devayani's house. Okay. Do you know what he came for? To abduct Devayani... ...and present her to the King. How did you deduce that? I guessed it. The court is not a place where you can state something you've guessed. Only what you've seen, heard, experienced or smelled, can be recorded as evidence. Not your guesses. He was stating his opinion. But this is a fact-finding forum. And fact is perceived by sense, not by the whims and fancies of someone. Avoid interfering in the cross-examination. Answer the question, avoiding your guesses. Are you aware of the reason why the royal servant came there? No. You stopped a superior official of the country, who had come there to execute his official duty, and injured him. Isn't that right? No. When he tried to abduct Devayani... Answer to my question. Did you stop him? I did. Yes. For obstructing a superior official who had come there to execute his official duty, and for injuring him, as per sections 353 and 330 of the EPC, you have committed a crime. Moreover, you've joined the conspirators who wish to overturn the monarchy, and you're giving a false statement for a fake complainant. I suggest so. I've said only what I've seen. Because of your insane love towards Devayani, you are lying due to your hallicunatory thoughts. That's all, Your Honour. Any cross for the defence counsel? No cross, Your Honour. Not even a single question? No, Your Honour. Do you have a spell or cure for this back ache, Swamy? Yes. Understanding the spirit of the Bodhi tree, you should look down from the root of an uprooted Banyan tree. But don't look from the leaf to the root. Huh? Call the next witness. CW3 Devayani Unni. You want in-camera trial? No, Your Honour. Let the proceedings be transparent. Devayani, do you feel that the trial of the case should be carried out in a closed room, in the absence of others? No. Whatever I say, should be known to the world, even if something happens to me. You can enter the dock. You may proceed. In the name of God and the Mighty King, I swear that I shall state only the truth in court. In the name of God and the Mighty King, I swear that I shall state only the truth in court. You can explain what happened. On the morning of the 14th day of the month of Magha, I got back home after visting the temple, and was cleaning the lamps. That's when I heard the clopping sound of an approaching horse, outside. That clopping sound came to a halt, outside my house. I heard the person who came there, enquiring about me. I paid attention to what he was saying. I realized that he has come to take me to the palace, and that the person who arrived, is the Chief Minister of the country, from his conversation. The Minister entered my house. I was terrified. Congratulations, Devayani. Amazing rewards are awaiting you at the palace. Get ready for the journey. We should start immediately. Right away. I said that I don't want that good fortune, and that I want to stay with my father. Sir... My daughter's wedding hasn't been fixed yet. Please give me some time. -Father! -Please show mercy. I don't have time for anymore arguments. We have to travel a long way. Saying that he has no time for arguments, he pulled my hand strongly. The glass bangles on my hand broke, and injured my hand. He took me outside the house. He defeated Gopi, who came to stop him, and pushed him down. He took me away on his horse. Describe what happened during the journey. During the journey, I fell unconscious at some point. He squeezed the juice of a fruit and poured it into my mouth. On my hand that was injured by the broken bangles, he applied the medicine made with the extract of a wild herb. That night, we stayed over at an inn. " Radha, O' Radha, O' Radha of the spring season " " Whom are you searching for, O' starlet? " " You are waiting for someone " " O' poor cowherd girl " " The night has fallen, and are you standing alone in the forest? " " Please don't cry, isn't it late? " " Many kinds of people including thieves will be waiting at every corner " " Wolves, tigers and wild elephants may pounce on you " " You will fall into their hands, like a helpless deer " " You will fly like a feather in the warm breeze " " Radha, O' Radha, O' Radha of the spring season " " Whom are you searching for, O' starlet? " " You are waiting for someone " " O' poor cowherd girl " " The night has falllen, and are you standing alone in the forest? " " Radha, O' Radha, O' Radha of the spring season " " Whom are you searching for, O' starlet? " " You are waiting for someone " " O' poor cowherd girl " " The night has fallen, and are you standing alone in the forest? " I felt that he could tame even an elephant that's running amok, with a single stare. I began admiring him. In the journey afterwards, he spoke very affectionately to me. I will be sending someone to bring your father, Devayani. Don't worry. Only good things will happen to you. I am with you. I know that... this is the first time you're seeing the world... outside your small village and temple. There's a world beyond the flowers that you tie at the temple, and the songs that you sing. There's sky. If you don't look, you can't see that. And once you see it, you'll never have enough of it. While crossing the fourth river, I confessed my love to him. Your beauty can put even the celesital nymphs to shame. I never knew that there was such a girl in this country of Manomaya. Who wouldn't fall in love with you? " My heart is full of romance, O' Krishna " " There's no reason for you to come secretively " " At the moment when you sprinkle your words like snow " " I searched for each word, affectionately " " My silence outpoured as flowers, during this journey with you " " You became the whole world within my eyes " " You became the full moon of my nights " " I wore the Sari that you gifted me " " And blended into your life " Instead of the broken bangles, he bought many glass bangles for me. I felt that he was the full moon which showed the sky to the asparagus plant. He gave me a new Sari, symbolizing marriage thereby, and he was no longer a stranger to me. He became my God. My life! Before I could relish my dreams of living as his wife with him, we reached a magnificent palace, that I had never seen before. He took me to the royal court of that palace. He asked me to bow to the King. I offered my respects to the King. Then, the King complimented the Chief Minister. The minister told the King, "I am offering this maiden to you, Your Highness" In return of presenting me to the King, the King gave several gifts to the Minister. He accepted all those gifts, without looking at my face. He earned those gifts by breaking my heart and betraying me. Not just me. The Minister relinquished my love and trust, as well. What happened after that? I was in a frozen state. The King was trying to make me cry, from that moment onwards. With a bleeding, broken heart, I became like a lifeless wooden doll. The King roared, asking me why I wasn't crying. I didn't understand anything. The King assaulted me physically. I fell unconscious. When I regained consciousness, I was in the charitable hospital. How many days had passed? I don't know. The soldiers of the King brought me here. That's all, Your Honour. Defense counsel? Now you can start the cross-examination. Are you in love with Gopi Kishan? No. You said that you travelled for two days with the Minister, right? Did you try to escape, at any point? How can I escape from a strong and mighty person like the Minister? He had told your father that he's taking you to the palace. Yes. There are several girls in the palace, who are much more beautiful than you. Why should the Minister present a flower-seller like you, to the King then? I object to that question, Your Honour. This question will affect the moral integrity of the witness. Shall not be permitted! This is a question based on motive, Your Honour. She has to answer. Can you answer it, Devayani? I heard the King saying that I had all the traits and qualities he was looking for. I didn't understand what he meant. You said that the King hurt you, right? How did he hurt you? He tried to tease me and make me cry, initially. Then, he did many things on my body. By many things, you mean? Did he touch your private parts? Is it something like that? It is an indecent question. It should not be asked. No. This is a most relevant question, Your Honour. Continue the cross-examination. Did the King rape you in public? That's not what I meant. Then what do you mean? You're saying that he tortured you physically and mentally. What's the reason for that? I don't know. This kind of evidence is not fitting to common sense, and should be summarily rejected. Why should His Highness torture a girl, without any reason? The abductors should be answering that question. Not a helpless woman. You can continue. Your father and you are cooking up illogical lies, as part of a conspiracy against the King and his rule. I suggest so. I have spoken only about what I have experienced. That's all, Your Honour. What about you, counsel for the Minister? You said that the Minister pulled your hand in your house, right? Was that the first time a stanger touched you? Yes. What did you feel when the Minister touched you? I felt scared. And later, you fell in love with him, all of a sudden? I fell in love with him, due to his behaviour during the journey. Have you ever asked him whether he's married? His eyes were full of... ...his love for me. Can you read everything from the eyes? To realize what you saw in his eyes was love, have you ever seen love in anyone's eyes? No. Had you seen love in Gopi Kishan's eyes? No. The Minister plucking fruits for you, and applying medicine on your wound, were just basic decency and providence... of a senior official who had come to enforce the King's command. You don't have the ability... ... to differentiate between providence and love. I suggest so. He betrayed me, acting as if he was in love with me. Without obeying the King's order, you have brought even the Minister to the accused dock. I suggest that you haven't followed the duty of a subject towards her King. Even the subject has some basic rights. Your Honour, as you mentioned earlier, this is a rare occurence. The King is facing a trial in the court. Your Honour, I would like to hear the explanation of the defence, for their offensive, illogical, irrational and unexplainable act. I may be permitted to continue after hearing their explanations. Yes. Argument of the learned prosecutor is nothing but an absurdity. We must never forget the maxim that the King can do no wrong. Just because His Highness appeared in this court, none of his protection clauses becomes invalid. All royal acts... ... are legal. Unless proven to the contrary, by the complainant. The reason why the witness number three was kidnapped, is still unknown to her. Here, the King has intervened in the personal liberty of a subject. The basic foundation of a person's happiness... ...is his personal liberty. You are wrong, Mr. Prosecutor. There is no difference between the King and the State. All personal liberties exist... ...based on the King's rule. For example, the right of a person to earn assets. It is supposed to be personal liberty. But the King... ... or the Government... ...can seize those assets, if they want to. To disclose the top-secret of a country to an enemy country; we don't have the liberty to do that, as individuals. No citizen is above the State. Personal liberty is not absolute. Personal liberty and freedom of expression are the most important... Stop it! I've been listening to this for a long time now. What all are you saying? Is this your great court? Is this your civility? Now... I will speak! You should listen! When the King has an advocate, if he fights the case himself, the court procedure will be disrupted. You shut up! I will chop off your tongue! Sit there! Your Honour... All of you, sit down! Sit down! Your Honour, I am relinquishing my legal services. Let His Highness speak for himself. Tell me. What do you have to say, Your Majesty? I came here today... Keep fanning! I came here in person today... not because I had to follow the Higher Court's order, unlike what you said. I don't care what the people would say, either. I came here... to find a solution for a problem that I haven't been able to solve. I.... I issued an order. This girl who has filed a complaint at this court against me... She is just a subject of mine! She didn't obey it. Even my Minister didn't obey it. I should have chopped their heads. I didn't do that. If you could mention what was that command of yours which this girl didn't obey, there will be some clarity. Well... I will come. No. I need to rethink whether I have to say it or not. Until then, the court can ask questions to others. If you want, you can question the Minister. Yes, yes. Why do I need the throne to urinate? Take it away! So, until His Highness comes back, let the Chief Minister Veerabhadran speak. I am also relinquishing my legal services, Your Honour. The Minister shall speak for himself. You may speak. The man who was in the accused dock is in the witness dock, all of a sudden. Legally and technically, it's wrong. I don't know! People who do not know how a King is supposed to be, and how a monarchy should function... I heard them uttering foolishness. The complainants and their advocates are totally out of their minds. On getting up from the bed, the King shall be received by troops of women armed with bows. In the second compartment, he shall be received by eunuchs presenting him his coat and head-dress, aged persons and other harem attendants. In the third compartment, he shall be received by crooked and dwarfish persons. In the fourth, by prime ministers, kinsmen, and door-keepers with barbed missiles in their hand. The King might summon someone for any such purpose, or to give positions in the office of the King, and that comes under the power of the King. A minister should be pure in character and free from procrastination and ficklemindedness. His Highness commanded that he needs a girl. As a responsible royal servant, I wandered in search of a girl who'd meet the King's prerequisites. A Minister who's a firm devotee of a King, should be possessed of endurance and enthusiasm. And so, upon my secret investigation, I learned that there is a flower-selling girl at the Kunninmukalilappan temple in the village of Chithrapuri, situated at the border of the country. I also learned that she is a girl who would match the King's prerequisites. Crossing 400 villages over two nights and two days, crossing the fort, crossing three mountain ranges and four rivers, I arrived at that village in Chithrapuri. I heard a song over there... ...in a girl's voice. A beautiful song. " Won't you be able to come near me, with a beautiful melody? " " I shall give you my heart " " Don't make me daydream, O' dear Krishna " " My night has not disappeared till today " Namaste, o' noble soul. I am the prime servant of the King of this country. Your daughter, the maiden Devayani, shall become the wife of the King, and the mother of the future King of the country. By giving your daughter away to the King, you shall become a relative of the royal family. The allegations that she didn't obey what the King said, and that I didn't obey the King's order, are quite painful to hear. In fact, I don't have clarity about it, even today. Please tell me yourself... that what you had in your eyes when you held me close, was not love. Speak about abandoning me, after promising that you'll be there for me. That's not the main issue here, girl. The issue is that a subject did not obey the King's command. The one who lives upon the grains, cattle, and gold of the King, the one who supplies the same to the king in weal or woe, the one who keeps under restraint a disaffected relative of the king or a rebellious district, as well as the one who drives away an invading enemy or a wild tribe. He is the true subject of the country. That girl did not obey what His Highness told her. That's the issue here, right? Yes! That's the issue, indeed! That's the main issue! I... She didn't obey what I said! That's the main issue, indeed! I shall speak. I have been suffering from an illness for a while now. These hiccups don't end. I noticed that too. Don't they stop even after you drink water? No. They don't. I will have hiccups, and then drink water. My bladder becomes full. I will urinate. And I'll have hiccups again. I am unable to sleep! I can't pay attention to royal affairs. If the King is ill, how can he protect the country? Who will protect the country from enemies? That's true. Didn't you consult any physician? I did. Many physicians came. I had several medicines too, but I was not cured. And then one day, I had a dream. The late Royal Priest appeared in my dream and suggested a solution to cure my illness. That's why... I asked for a girl with a soul as pure as the spike of a basil plant. The girl whom the Minister brought, was like the girl whom I saw in my dream. But... she didn't obey my royal command. I didn't chop off her head, because I was merciful. If I could know what was the command of yours that she didn't obey, the court can pass a verdict. Well... How do I say that? Any difficulty in saying that? But how will I know, unless you say it? Have you heard that a dream seen at dawn, will come true? Yes. I have heard so. Then... it is said that once you share the dream you saw with someone else, it won't come true. But... if I don't know what it is, how can I pass a verdict? I will tell you. At dawn, the royal priest told me in my dream, that if I drink a cup of tears from a girl who's as pure as the spike of the basil plant, my thirst and hiccups shall be cured. I found a girl with all the attributes and qualities. But... she didn't shed tears! How many times did I tell you? How many times? In every way possible! This court is going to pronounce the judgement... ...and the decree. From the first witness Krishnanunni's statement, only the fact that a royal official took Krishnanunni's daughter along with him, has come to light. The remaining allegations are just his thoughts and speculations. After examining the documents and evidence in this case, it is proved that the second witness obstructed the royal servant's duty, even without knowing the reason. Those who are obliged to follow the King's commands, those who are living under the monarchial rule, the first and second witnesses, have not behaved as ideal citizens, in this case. The court dismisses their complaints, since they are found to be baseless. Though the third witness is alleging that the King tortured her brutally, the fact that not even a teardrop was shed from her eyes, raises suspicions regarding the intensity of the torture. So, the stories of torture cannot be taken at face value, by the court. While travelling with the Chief Minister, he protected her with caution, and bought her clothes before presenting her at the royal court. Unfortunately, the third witness, who's a flower-seller, misconstrued it to be love. The Chief Minister was just executing the King's order. So, the complaints against the King and the Minister, do not stand, due to the absence of evidence. And thus, the court denies their plea. From the King's complaint which was considered along with this complaint, and from the reasons he stated in front of this court, it is found that witnesses one to three, disobeyed the King's commands and committed treason against the country. The complaints of witnesses one to three, against the King and the Minister, are dismissed unconditionally. Ensuring that the King who rules the country leads a happy and peaceful life, is the obligation of every citizen. The court seriously considers the fact that the tears of the third witness are required for that. For the nation's security, and to cure the King's illness, the necessary amount of tears have to be collected immediately, from witness number three, in any which way possible, and should be given right away to the mighty King, before the court, orders the court. Devayani, you may come forward. Devayani, you heard the decree, right? Yes. Is it clear? Yes. Let all the problems end right away. For such a silly matter, we shouldn't have troubled His Highness. Anyway, I am happy. We've found a solution, right? Bring a vessel in which the tears can be collected for the King. Cry! Huh? Just try. Not like that. Try this. Once again! Try again. Yes, like that. Yes, it will come. The tears will come. Like that! Yeah! They are not coming? Devayani, a tear is a liquid that can lubricate our eyes. Lacrimal gland. Except goats and rabbits, all mammals have this gland. You have it too. But only in the case of humans, when we have emotions like fear, pain or sorrow, these tears come out, on their own. Understood? Now, why don't you try again after imagining all this? Pain... Fear! Sorrow! Like that! Once again. Yes! I understand. You are unable to imagine pain, fear or sorrow in your mind, right? Hey! I'm almost done counting, sir. Bring a chair. Stand on that chair, Devayani. Your Honour... I was often asked to stand on the bench like this, back in school. My teacher used to say that I was the biggest fool in my class. So sad! Please try, Devayani. You can do it if you try. I have seen the tears of so many people here. Some people cannot stop once they start crying. Please try. Like that! It will come! They will come. The tears will come! Can't do it? -Come here. -Sir! Sir. -Do it. -Okay sir. What is this? Has she teared up? Has she? No. The court's decree should not be violated, Devayani. That's why. Hey! Come here. -Sir. -It will come then. I will sort it out now. Just a minute. Is it coming? See if she's shedding tears? No, Your Honour. No. Bring the whip. No! Yes, whip her! Oh no! My God! Whip her! Are the tears coming? Whip her! Hit her! -Swami. -Swami! Swami! Swami! He has opened his eyes. Please wake up, Swami. Please go there, Swami. That girl will die now. Please do something, Swami. Get up! Come on! Swami... Your Honour! Your Honour! What is it? Doing all this won't make her shed tears, Your Honour. It won't. Hey! Who is he? Who let him inside? Catch him... Put him in prison! Let go of me! I can solve this problem. Just give me five minutes. Hey! Let go of him! Let go of him, Minister. Let go! I will tell the King about the secret you've hidden in your attic. Let go of him, Minister! Who are you? Let him try. There's something special about him. Can you make her shed tears within five minutes? -I can. -Please try. Go ahead, drink it! I am happy! Tell me what you want! The King is happy! The King is happy! Veera! Veerabhadra! So... the story of the King and the Minister is over? Swami! Poor King! Let him sleep peacefully. Right, Swami? Swami! What did the Minister hide in his attic, Swami? What the Minister hid in his attic, was the woman whom he believed to be the most beautiful in the country of Manomaya, his own wife. The lady whom he presented before the King as his wife, was the gardener's wife. Even the Minister will have his own desires, right? Poor Minister! Are you leaving, Swami? Where are you going, Swami? Didn't I tell you, Babukkuttan? From emptiness to fullness... That is, from a void to infinity! " Everything is a mortal illusion " Swami! I have another doubt. Though the court acquitted citing lack of evidence, weren't you the one who stole that idol? I know that! I am just a witness to idols being created and stolen... and not a thief. True! That's true, Swami. Oh no! Swami, you turned into a butterfly? How did you turn into a butterfly? Can you teach me that spell? Mustared soaked in cheetah's milk for seven nights, should be heated with wood from a tree struck by lightning. If you consume that, you can fly, Babukkuttan. You can fly around, and see immortal kings, without ending up at the wrong time. You can see ministers. You can hear the sound of whips too.
