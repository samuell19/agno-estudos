State your name for the record, pleas. Jack Lucas. For the record, I'm detectie sergeant Joseph Dexter, internal affairs. This interview is beig conducted with regards to case number 65-a456. [ Lighter clicks ] [ Lighter clicks shut ] Would you mind? Sorry. [ Ashes sizzling ] [ Inhales, exhales ] [ Heartbeat pounding ] Okay, detective Lucas, let's talk about the evens of April 23, 200. Uh... [ Glass shattering ] My partner, al voss, and I were set to pick up an informant. Uh, he had some information on some drive-by shootings that we thought the red dragons were responsible for. [ Machine-gun fire ] This one pretty much sealed it. [ Bullets clanking ] Police! Drop your -- [ bullets clanking ] Uh! [ Engine revving ] [ Tires screeching ] So, uh, detective, uh, voss and I immediately went off in pursuit. [ Tires screeching ] Were you aware, detective Lucas, that the month prir to this incident, your partner's cellphone lg showed over 25 calls to one of the red dragon's top lieutenants? No, I was not. [ Gunshot ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Gunfire ] And that the last of these calls was placd less than an hour before you and detective voss staked out the Hong luck -- huang luck. Huang -- huang luck market? He, uh... [ Gunshot ] [ Gunfire ] He did step out of the car at one point for some privacy. I assumed he was calling his wife. You just assumed? Yes. He was my partner. I trusted him. [ Tires screeching ] So what you're telling m, detective Lucas... Al? ...is that you had absolutely no knowledge... [ Tires screeching ] ...of your partner's extracurricular contacs with the red dragon? [ Shell casings clinking ] No, none whatsoever. [ Sirens wailing ] You expect me to believe that? [ Gun clicks ] You can believe what you want. It's the truth. [ Gunshot, tires screeching ] [ Glass shattering, metal squealing ] [ Dog barking ] [ Horn honking, indistinct shouting ] Hey! Whoo! Whoo! [ Man laughing ] Wait, wait, wait! [ Laughs ] Whoo! Whatever happened to trick-or-fucking-treat, huh? [ Ice clinking ] Man: That's what he said anyway. [ Laughs ] Hi, Jack. [ Indistinct conversation, cash register dings ] [ Irish accent ] Ah, you're a lovely man, Eddie, and you always will be. You're not gonna get into my pants no matter how much you try to sweet-talk me, Jack. [ Normal voice ] Oh, yeah. You get those flowers I sent? Ah, fuck you, huh? Hey, cut it out or else I'll -- I'll have to start advertising that the great Jack Lucas is a regular here. Maybe sell some tickets. Nobody gives a shit about that, Eddie, all right? Innkeeper! [ Laughter ] Straw for my men, wine for my horses. I'm a little short on straw, Mr. Lucifer. What else is your preference? Martini up, olives. Right. Thank you. And get this man another whatever he's having. Make it a double -- the least I can do for having nearly run him down with my carriage. My humblest apologies, my good sir. That's all right, okay? And the drink's not... [ Indistinct conversations, laughter continue ] ...necessary. Well, it would seem to b, as they say in Paris, a fait accompli. I suggest you enjoy it. [ Billiard balls clacking ] I'm Ollie. Jack. Good to meet you, Jack. You look familiar. You an actor? [ Laughs ] No, but I bet you are. Oh. How could you tell? [ Laughs ] [ Sniffs ] So, what do you do? I work for the city. Can't get it. I know I know you. I just -- it'll hit me. I'll be driving home -- bang! It'll hit me. Hmm. Long as you don't hit anybody else. Touché. Lovely. Thank you. [ Indistinct conversations, cash register dings ] [ Coins clinking ] [ Billiard balls clacking ] Great ass, huh? Yeah, museum quality. [ Laughs ] My ex had an ass like that. Walked in on her screwing another guy -- broke my heart. It's kind of stupid, though, you know? She didn't love me. Now the bitch wants half of everything I own. Yeah. What are you gonna do? You can't live with 'em... You can't kill 'em. [ Laughs ] But I'll tell you something, man-to-man -- if I wasn't such a fucking pussy, I would strangle that gold-digging slut with my bare hands. [ Sniffs ] You want to see a picture of her? Sure. Why not? Works downtown -- a place called the plaype. You know it? I've been in there once or twice. Yeah, sure you have -- once or twice. [ Laughs ] You got kids? No. If you had kids, would you let a slut like that teach 'em? The reason I ask is this particular slut goes to the valley every morning, teaches little girls how to plié, then at night, fucks onstage for money. Two shows a night, seven days a week, she'll fuck anything that moves. Men, women, donkeys -- doesn't matter. Obviously, the place has changed since the last time I was in. [ Pager ringing ] Ahh. Duty calls. Yeah. Eddie, ring me up, will you? I got to make a phone call. Thanks. It was nice talking to you, Jack. [ Indistinct conversation ] [ Printer clicking ] [ Paper tearing ] [ Dialing ] Excuse me. Yeah. Is that, uh... Yeah. Real-life hero, my friend. [ Sighs ] The mobile customer you are trying to reach - [ receiver clicks ] It was hit and run all the wa, and here comes the throw, and he is safe! Yeah, safe. Leets made a nice throw, but just a little late... This one's all yours, pal, okay? It was surely a double play... Listen, do me a favor. Get one of your buddies to drive you home. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on. This guy just told me who you are. I knew I knew you. It was that article. I read that. What was that -- three, four months ago? Yeah, something like that. Look, let me show a little gratitude, all right? You guys work your asses off. A toast. A toast! To the heroes! The real kind. Oh, god! [ Inhales sharply ] Oh, god, I am sorry. I am so sorry. Don't worry about it, okay? It's -- it's fine. For Christ's sakes. Are you all right, Jack? Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's nothing, Eddie. Don't worry. God, I feel terrible. Let me -- let me take care of this. Fine. Thank you. It is -- it is an accident. I'll -- I'll take care of it. Eddie: You come in, busting te joint up, for Christ's sakes. Let me get a broom in the back. [ Breathing heavily ] [ Door hinges squeaking ] Uh. [ Breathing heavily ] Are you all right? [ Clears throat ] [ Distorted ] Are you okay? [ Water running ] [ Water gurgling in drain ] Jack! Jack! Hey! Jack! Hey, come on! Wake up! You all right? Jack! Hey. Easy. Hey, look, I know I pour a hell of a drink, but this is ridiculous. You're half Irish, for Christ's sakes. One drink and you're facedown in the toilet? You should be ashamed of yourself. That hand -- you need to get it looked at. [ Water running ] I'll get your cigarettes. [ Breathing heavily ] Here. Thanks. What the hell... What? What are you looking for? Nothing. [ Horn honking ] That guy -- the guy with the devil mask -- is he still here? No, him and his friends left about 10 or 15 minutes ago. [ Echoing ] Let me -- let me take care of this. You got his credit-card imprint, right? No, they -- they paid cash. What? All right, listen -- uh...uh, Eddie, you got to do me a favor. Yeah, sure. Anything, Jack. What? That guy or anybody he was with -- they come back in here, you got to call me, all right? Yeah, sure. You want me to call you a cab? [ Exhales deeply ] No. No, the, uh, fresh air might do me good. [ Door closes ] [ Beeps ] Hey, neighbor, it's Caitlin. Listen, am I stupid or what? I just realized I forgot to tell you to give Rudy one of the pills along with his food, which, sorry, I left in the truck. The keys are on the counter. If you need to reach me, my brother's number in San Francisco is 415-555-672. See you next week! [ Receiver clicks ] [ Beeps ] Jack, it's your dad. I didn't hear from you. I'm assuming we're still on for tomorrow. See you then. [ Receiver clicks, answering machine beeps ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Lawn mower whirring ] Hey, pop. Sorry I'm late. That car was supposed to get you through graduatio, not retirement. Yeah. Well, you know me. I have a hard time letting go of things. I was just reminiscing with your mother about something that happened when you were a boy. Pop... It's been two years. What is it you used to tell your patients? There's a time to stop grieving and a time to start living again. And I always used to tell you... Don't shrink the shrink. Don't shrink -- that's right. Help me up, will you? Oh, no. You look like crap. Oh, hey, thanks. You're still not sleeping, are you? It's getting better. I'm up to, like, three hours a night. Three hours? Here I was worried. Why don't you let me prescribe something for you, huh? No, no, all right? I don't want to argue about this, dad. I'm gonna lick this on my own. Well, you always were a stubborn little son of a bitch, weren't you? Yeah, well, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it? I'm gonna have to plead no contest to that one. I'll let you off with a warning...This time. [ Sighs ] Come on. There's a plate of bacon and eggs out there with your name on 'em. [ Indistinct conversation ] I sure hope you got the tag number... Of the truck that hit you. Yeah, it was a rough one. You look like shit. What -- you been talking to my old man? He just told me the exact same thing. Hey, great minds. How's he doing anyway? Ahh. Good. He's good. Thanks for asking. Lucas. 3:00 tomorrow afternoon. You know, Joe, you should try using complete sentences once in a while. It really helps. As in my office, 3:00 tomorrow afternoon. Yeah? What for? Well, you'll find out when you get there, won't you? Oh, fuck you. Excuse me. I didn't catch that. Nothing. Tomorrow. You got to watch your mouth, partner. Talking shit won't help your case any. Look, I heard him talking to pruitt -- he's submitting your report day after tomorrow. Good. It's about fucking time. What do you mean, good? You're not worried? We all got a job to do. Dexter's just doing his, you know? Yeah, right. Yeah, the report will say what it says, and then whatever happens will happen. What are you, a Buddhist now? Why don't you just shave your head, put on your little orange robe, and go hang out at the airport? No, I shaved my head in college once on a dare. I looked like a dope. Yeah, well, you're sure acting like one. Might as well go the distance. Ooh. Ooh. Look, I'm going to the bathroom. I'm gonna get the shaving cream and the razor, hear? [ Birds chirping ] [ Engine shuts off, keys jingling ] [ Gunshot ] Noisy bugger, aren't you? Did you gargle with salt watr like I told you? Yeah, well, I know it doesn't taste goo. Hey, don't you use that word with me, young man, or you'll be gargling down soap when i'm through with you, hear? Okay, look, I know -- I know you're sick, okay? I'm sorry. But mama can't come home right now. Your daddy will be home in a couple hours and -- [ snapping ] What? You got to go, go. You sure? Yeah, no problem. I got plenty to do here. Thank you. I'll be home in 20 minute. Get the salt water ready. I'll check in with you later. [ Telephone ringing ] Works at a place downtown - the playpen. You know it? [ Dialing ] Playpen. This is mik. Yeah, hi, this is detective Jack Lucas, l.A.P.D. Homicide. I need the last name of one of your dancers. [ Vehicle door opens ] Hey, Judy! Hey, Jess. [ Keys jingling ] See you, girls. Pepper spray. Back off! Okay, take it easy! Take it easy! I-I'm -- I'm a detective, all right? I'm Jack Lucas, l.A.P.D. Homicide, okay? Are you Jessica tarrant? Yeah, what do you want? First, I want you to put the pepper spray away. Can we do that? I-I just need to ask you a few questions. What can I help you with? I'm gonna be late for work. Uh, it's, uh, it's about your ex-husband. Oh, my god. What did he do? I-I can't really comment on anything that he may or may not have done. I just need some information like a-a phone number or an address. From me? I haven't seen him in... Two years. Last I heard, he was back in england. England. Yeah, so, sorry. I can't help you. But good luck. Hope you find him. And if you do, please don't let him know where he can find me. [ Engine clicking ] Oh, shit, shit! Not again! [ Exhales sharply ] You got AAA? Expired. Oh. Jumper cables? [ Sighs ] Think it's just the batter? I can't be late for work tonight. You're asking the wrong guy. Great. So you're saying that you hadn't seen your ex in a couple of years? Yeah. My battery's all corrode. Brand-new. Yeah. Was he prone to violence at all? [ Scoffs ] I guess that's a "yes"? Yeah. Angry punk rocker who liked to hit women. We were married for three months. Rick the dick. Should I start it? W-W-Wait a second. What did you say his name was? Rick. Last name Oliver by any chance? Because the guy who says he's your ex-husband introduced himself to me as Ollie. Could he be using an assumed name -- I mean, living in the country illegally? It's not Rick. Yeah, how do you know? Because I know! But you do know this Ollie character? Yeah. Why do you think I have the pepper spray? Well, do you know his last name or -- or maybe where he lives? No, I don't know his last name. I don't want to know where he lives. I just don't want to see the guy anymore. Should I start the car? Uh, yeah, yeah. Give it a try. [ Engine clicking ] Oh. Shit! He was a regular at the club. He was there almost every night. Really big tipper. He used to stuff $100 bills in my bra. He told me that I-I reminded him of some old movie actres, somebody I never even heard of. It was no big DEA, you know? I didn't think twice about him. Till one night, I'm backstage changing, and he's -- he's back there, and he starts groping me, and he wouldn't take no for an answer. Really creepy. I yelled out for Mike, the bounce. He comes, he throws the guy ou, and he tells him not to come back to the club. When was this? Two months ago. That's when all the weird shit started happening. Oh, yeah? Like? Late-night hang-ups, filthy messages on my machine -- stuff like that. All right, slow down. It's right up here on the right. So, uh...Listen, if you -- if you need anything, you just give me a call, okay? Because dance lessons don't pay the rent. Excuse me? That's the answer. What's the question? Why would I want to work in a place like this? I've seen that look before. Listen, I, uh, I already have one shrink in my life. I think that's my limit. [ Footsteps approaching ] Jess? Hey, girl. Hi. Jack, this is my friend, Sandy. Be careful -- he's a cop. Oh. You better get in there. Sal's pissed. Okay, I'll be right in. Well, thanks for the ride. Yeah, listen, did you happen to keep any of those tapes of the, uh, messages he sen? Yeah. Can you get 'em to me? Why? So they can collect dust on your desk? Sorry. No, that's all right. People have their issues with cops. What are you gonna do? Have a better day. [ Dance music plays ] Man: Good afternoon, gentleme, and welcome to the playpen, where every hour is happy hou. So take your hands out of your pockets and put 'em together for sand. Isn't she lovely? How'd you like to get into those boots, ladies and gentlemen? And on stage two, the lovely Jessica! Put your hands together for Jessica. Do the collars and cuffs matc? You'll find out in a minute, gentlemen. [ Music continues ] ♪ For you ♪ ♪ for you ♪ [ Sighs ] Hey, Josh, how's the throat? Mama didn't make you gargle with soap, did she? [ Laughs ] Yeah, yeah. Put her on. Hi, how are you? Yeah. No, no. You didn't miss anything. No, I just followed up on a couple of loose ends. I came up empty. Yeah. All right, I'll see you tomorrow, then. No, I'm going straight home, mother. [ Laughs ] Good night. Yo, Jack! I'm glad I caught you, man. Yo, man, we're going out to O'Malley's, man. You coming? Oh, come on, man. All right. Why not? Yeah. Let's roll. Oh, oh, oh. [ Laughs ] [ Wheels squeaking ] [ Keys jingling ] [ Squeaking resumes ] [ Switch clicks ] [ Lock clicks, drawer opens ] [ Drawer closes ] [ Laughter ] So, check it out -- this Indian dude goes into a whorehouse to get laid for the first time. Ohh. [ Laughs ] They tell him, "you know, you need to go outside "and practice on a knot in a tree for a while and come back in." So he goes out a couple of hours, comes back, and says, "I'm ready now." They get their best hoe. They send him in the back room, right? So, they get in there. He starts poking her arm with a stick. Bitch says, "what the fuck are you doing?" Indian dude says, "me be smart this time. Me check for bees." [ Laughter ] Ohhh! Come on, Jesus! Didn't you tell that one last week? Oh, no. Fuck no, man. That was brand-new, man. [ Laughs ] All right. Okay. That's it for me, boys. Oh, no, no, no. Where you going, man? Yeah. No, I'll see you tomorrow, man. Come on, man. The night's still fresh. Come on, Jack. Come on, now. I got plenty more jokes, man. One more drink. Come on, man. All right, I'll get US another round. Ah, there you go. Martinez, move, move. Yeah, make 'em cold, Jack. Excuse me, excuse me. [ Laughs ] [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Engine revving ] Jack, good to see you. Enough with the games, asshole. Where's my fucking gun? Well, I'm sure it will turn up someplace. All right, out of the fucking car right now. Have you seen your I.A. File? You should be concerned with that. It's not exactly a rave. How the hell do you know about that? You're off duty, Jack. You should learn to relax. All right, stop it. All right, stop this car. You are under arrest! You're under arrest, goddamn it! [ Tires screeching ] Don't touch that glas. Excuse me. Here. Thank you. Do me a favor. Get me a baggie or something, okay? Mm-hmm. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Snoring ] [ Crickets chirping ] [ Clattering ] [ Dog barking ] [ Sniffs ] [ Billiard ball thumping ] [ Footsteps approaching ] Ohh! Uhh! Joe...so sorry. [ Coughing ] Is that your nose? Ohh! Uhh! Uhh! Whoo! Uhh! [ Gasping ] Uhh! Ohh! [ Crying ] Please, stop! Whoo! [ Sobbing ] This is a nice place you got here, Joe. [ Sobbing ] I'm a big fan of divorce modern myself. Thinking of having some work done at my place. [ Laughs ] This! Wow, right in the middle of the fucking living room. Bet the missus would never let you get away with this, huh? [ Gasping ] Why are you doing this? We live in a fucked-up society, Joe. Cops get criticized, criminals run free... But, when assholes like you from within the force itsef make other cops' lives even more difficult, that's where I draw the line. [ Sobbing ] Why are you doing this? What do you want? Joe, I need you to sign this. I made a few changes. I hope you don't min. I didn't write this. It's false. It's dirty. Lucas is not involved. Sign the fucking paper! [ Sobs ] Thank you, Joe. You've been very cooperative [ gun cocks ] In what I know are trying circumstances. [ Gunshot ] [ Shell casing clinks ] [ Telephone beeping ] Homicide. Lucas. Ollie: Hey, Jack. What a kick, talking to you right there in the department. I bet you're tracking down the bad guys right now, huh? All right, look -- whoever you are, the joke's over, okay? [ Playing slow music ] I don't know if I like that tone of voice, Jack. This is your pal, Ollie, you're talking to. Bressler: You gave me the wrong file yesterday. I asked for the mcfarland file. You got something that belongs to me, you little shit, and I want it back. I'm sorry, what's that? You're gonna have to speak up. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! That's right, you can't. Not with all those other cops around. [ Music continues ] Must be embarrassing, Jack, to have your gun lifted by some dirtbag, and then not to report it, well...[Tsks] All right. Listen to me. So far, nobody's been hurt. If you want things to go easier for you, you'll stop this right now. Actually, things have been very easy as it is. You've been very cooperative, surprisingly so, and don't think for a minute that I don't appreciate it, because...i do. And it's really not accurate to say nobody's been hurt, Jack. That's right. The bad news is you lost your gun. The good news is I got him. Got who? What the hell are you talking about? [ Trilling notes ] Well, I'll give you a little hint. Have you seen Dexter this morning? He's not there, is he? Perhaps it's because his brains are splattered all over his living room. Is that too big of a hint? Jack? Are you there? Hello? Oh, come on. You've got to admit you're pleased. Is this some kind of sick joke? God, no, Jack. No, no, no, no, no. I would never joke about death. Death's too frightening, don't you think? [ Beeps ] Yeah, this is gifford in homicide. I need a trace on Lucas' phone. 15. Go, go! By the way, have you had a chance to see his report? There's only so much I can do to save you, Jack. I'm afraid the report's your problem. All right, buddy. Let's, uh...Let's just -- let's just slow down for a second, all right? Let's talk about thi. You know what, Jack? I feel strong. Strong enough to deal with that bitch ex-wife of mine. All right, this, uh -- this thing about Dexter -- can, uh -- can we talk ab-- can we talk some more about this? Sure. Sure thing. Let me just go get some quarters so I can spend a little more time on the phone with you. Gotta go. [ Telephone beeps ] [ Dial tone ] [ Inhales sharply ] Who was it? Anonymous tip. About what? [ Camera shutter clicks ] [ Camera shutter clicks ] [ Man talking indistinctly on police radio ] [ Talking indistinctly ] [ Gifford talking indistinctly ] ...and this is all you have? [ Talking indistinctly] Okay, but... Nobody touched it but you, right? All right, all righ. I know this is -- this is close to hom. Man, oh, man. I mean, Dexter wasnt anybody's favorite.. Here. Sorry, I don't do autographs. Cute. Well, I'll tell you one thing. This killer -- he's one careless individual. Either that, or he's trying to set somebody up. It's too damn easy. Look what bressler just found. Yeah, I got this out at the curb. It's got blood all over it. He must've dropped it on the way to his ca. [ Scoffs ] Let me go lock this in the truck. [ Indistinct conversations ] Well, well, well. Look who's here. I guess all five local channels must be outside no. Oh, my god. He's wearing makeup. Lucas. Gifford. Sir. Looks like everybody's managed to control their grieving. Well, Dexter was never a candidate for Mr. Congeniality, sir. I'll give you that. So, you guys were on the scene first? Yeah. Lucas got an anonymous tip. I see. O.i.s. Briefed me. What do you guys go? [ Exhales slowly ] Time of death between 3:00 and 6:00 A.M. We got the slug. It's, uh, a 9-mil. Execution-style killing. Okay. We're talking professional hit. Or somebody with a grudge. The way I hear it, ex-wife number one was after him for back alimony. Ex-wife number two caught him doing ex-wife number one, apparently right here on the pool table. All right, giffor. That's more information than I need right now. Well, I know it ain't pretty, sir, but she did say she'd kill him if she ever saw him again. Maybe she saw him again. Lucas, what do you think? I don't think we can rule anybody out at this point. Okay. Well, there's about a dozen good cops that are out on unemployment right now because Dexter got 'em bumped off the job, plus 15 ongoing investigations in our precinct alone. You happen to be one of those. Everybody knows Dexter was looking at me. That's right. Well, the media's gonna try to make a meal out of this, understand? Can't afford any more missteps, so I'm gonna put bresslr and Martinez on this on. Nothing personal. Sorry, guys. [ Radio news theme plays ] Man on radio: It's 11:58 in the southland. Coming up next on kzby, we go to the newsroom and sky copter -- [ clicks radio off ] [ Birds chirping ] You got any aspirin? Whatever my son's got, it seems like i'm coming down with it. Hey, Jack! How was your lunch, man? Fine. Why? 'Cause your dessert just showed up about an hour ago, man. Your honey here, I was trying to talk to her, but she wouldn't have nothing to do with me, man. All she wanted was you. Hey, Jack, man, you backing that, ain't you? No, no. She's just a fr-- no! Aw, come on, man. You could -- I'll be right back. Ha ha ha! Yeah, yeah. That's my man. Jack's backing that! Whoo! Whoo! You're a damn pig, bressler. Ain't no two ways about it. Hi. Did you bring me those tapes? Are you all righ? He was at my place, in my apartment. When? Last night. All right. How did he get in? I don't know. I don't know. I checked everything. I looked. [ Voice breaking ] The windows weren't jimmied, and my door was still locked. Did you see him? No, no! I was sleeping! Jesus! All right, all right. Just try to calm down, okay? I can't calm down, okay?! I want this guy arrested now. All right, look, look -- I -- I want this guy as bad as you do. Really. I -- I'm on your side, all right? [ Sobs ] But...but I have to -- I have to follow procedure here, okay? That's how it works. He was in my apartment. Next time, he could kill me in my bed. That's how it works. I wanna talk to a female cop. A female will understand. I understand, all right? But a female cop is gonna have to follow procedure just like me. "Procedure"? If your procedure means that I have to go home and wait for this psycho to slit my throat before you do something... You can take your procedure, you can shove it up your ass. All right, hold on, hold on a second, okay? Hold on. All right? All right, l-let me -- let me put it to you this way. You have to look at it like a judge would. All right, there was no evidence of a break-in, nothing was stolen, you didn't even see the guy, so if I want to pull a warrant, I have to have probable cause. You want probable cause? Here. A little present he left me last night. I'll give you three guesses what he did all over them. Show that to a judge. [ Exhales deeply ] Shh. [ Telephone ringing, indistinct conversations ] Jack: Jessica? Jessica, please. Mm-hmm. She wouldn't be the reason you have bags under your eyes every morning, would she? Pruitt: Jack! [ Sighs ] Jack, uh, did Dexter give you a copy of your I.A. Investigation before he got whacked? What do you mean, did he give me a copy? It's a simple question, Jack. No, of course he didn't. Why? Well, there were 15 ongoing investigations, but only 14 files in Dexter's cabinet. Yours is missing. Forget it. Let's hope it turns up. [ Telephone beeping ] Lucas. Yeah, yeah. Hey, George. Uh, yeah, thanks for getting back to me. I was calling about that glass from O'Malley's. You get any prints on that? Yeah, well, you know, it was worth a try. Thanks. [ Beeps ] Hi, it's Jess. Please leave me a message. If this is work-related, page me at -- [ Vehicle door closes ] Jessica? Oh, great. You're getting as bad as him. Would you just wait a second? I can't be late for work again. Could you just wait a second, please? [ Buzzes ] Mike, it's Jess. What? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was insensitive, but this thing is a lot more involved than it would appear with this Ollie guy, [ footsteps approaching ] And I couldn't really talk about it -- is there a problem here? No, Mike, he's cool. Thanks. I get off at 11:00. I'll pick you up. [ Gate hinges squeaking ] How you doing, Mike? [ Mid-tempo music plays ] [ Mid-tempo music continues ] Unh-unh. No touchies. Yes, yes, yes! I'm so out of here! What? This really freaky creep just made my rent! Plus! Don't worry, it's not him. This guy has, like, long, stringy hair, and his teeth are gross! You don't mind taking care of yourself tonight, do you? No, I have a ride, actually. Oh, no. Let me guess. "Freeze! Police!" Cut it out. "I'm sorry, ma'am. [ Sniffs ] "But I think I'm gonna have to frisk you --" stop it! [ Laughs ] It's not like that. Yeah, uh-huh. Right. [ Laughs ] [ Door opens ] Mike, call me a cab. Okay. You're a cab. Ha ha. You gotta admit, it's a little funny. Yeah, but keep the day job, big guy, okay? Wait a minute. [ Vehicle door closes ] Hey! Hey. You're early. Oh, really? She said 11:00. Yeah, well, since she was late last time... [ Lighter clicks ] Wonder why? [ Exhales ] Sal's making her stay. Hmm. [ Lighter clicks shut ] You should go in. Her act's hot. I'll get Mike to let you in for free. [ Ringing ] Um... No, I don't know. How long did you say? An hour? You're not gay or anything, are you? 'Cause most guys wouldn't mind -- I'm kidding. Well, if you're not in the mood to watch a bunch of beautiful women dance and wearing almost nothing, yeah, can I get a cab over at the playpen, please? You could save me some cab fare. Deal. Thanks!

[ Crying ] [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Police radio beeping ] [ Helicopter blades whirring ] [ Dog barking ] [ Police radio beeps, indistinct conversation ] You need to start leveling with me right now... Partner. What the hell's going on between you and her? I met her at the club. Oh. I didn't know you were into titty bars, Jack. But, hey -- we've only been working together three months. Guess I wasn't gonna find out everything all at once. Why was she down at the station today? She said somebody was threatening her. I told her i'd look into it. Oh, well, we sure as hell are doing that right now, aren't we? [ Indistinct conversations ] Look, Jack... I'm not boss. You're gonna have to trust me once in a while, okay? This girl might be dead 'cause you didn't. You don't think I don't know that, Carla? [ Conversations continue ] All right. [ Plastic rustling ] Look, I found this in the dead girl's hand. All we gotta do now is find some asshole walking around with no pocket on his shirt. You see this? Right here, along the bottom, along the seam. It's tobacco. [ Ashes sizzling ] Yeah. Just a few grains, but it makes our killer a smoker. Maybe the lab can tell US what brand the fucker smokes. [ Sighs ] Well... Shall we go talk to your friend? Yeah. [ Woman talking indistinctly on police radio ] I'm afraid you're not gonna be able to stay here tonigh. Do you have any friend, family you can get wit? No. Then I will give you the names of a few women's shelters. They'll be able to help you out. There's a decent oe over on Wilshire. I'll have a patrolmn take you there. Listen, Carla... I don't want to pass her off to a stranger, okay? She trusts me. I'll take her. Take me a half hour, 45 minutes. It's no big deal. Detective Lucas will take you. Thank you. [ Clattering ] Jack, I don't have to stay here. I -- I could -- no, you're safer here for now. I just don't want to cause you any more trouble. I'm already in trouble. [ Metal jingling ] [ Crackling ] The DNA results on my handkerchief should be in by tomorrow night. If I don't have anything on him by then... [ Flushes ] All right, I gotta get back to the crime scene. Try to get some rest. [ Shuffling footsteps approach ] [ Doorknob rattling ] [ Lock rattles, clicks ] [ Door hinges squeaking ] [ Exhales ] [ Hinges squeaking ] It's okay. I'm awake. I told you to take the bed. I'd hit the couch. No, I didn't feel comfortable with that. Um, I did borrow this, though. I hope it's okay. It was just kind of cold in here. Oh, some woman called, looking for you. I -- I wasn't snooping or anything, but the -- the volume was up on your machine. She had a really sexy voice. That was Caitlin, probably checking up on me. Oh. S-She's my neighbor. I -- I feed her cat when she's out of town. She's kind of, you know, neurotic about that. Uh, you want some coffee? Sure. I -- I got instant. Great. Hey, how did it go? When you got back. [ Pot clangs ] [ Clattering ] Fine. [ Faucet turns on, pot fills ] And your partner? Did you tell her that I was staying here? [ Faucet turns off ] [ Pot clattering ] I thought it best not to mention that for now. [ Lighter clicking, flame igniting ] It's amazing, isn't it? How one person can fuck up your life completely. But when it happens twice -- well, that's not really fair. What was the first time? [ Cigarette package rustling ] September 16, 1997. I'd just gotten back from the royal ballet summer workshop in London. I had an audition for the hottest new show on Broadway, and I was in love. Well, you know what happened there. Yeah, well, you wouldn't be the first person to blame the ex for fucking up your life. Oh, no, no. He was small potatoes. I'm talking about Peter kirmyer. Who's he? Bicycle messenger. He bring you some bad news or something? No. He hit me. The day before my audition, as I was crossing 57th street. I broke my ankle. And that, as they say, was that. When a horse breaks its leg, you shoot it. When a dancer breaks her leg, well, it's time to start looking into shoe sales. I think you're doing all right, you know? You're... You're working. Doing what you do. It's not exactly what I dreamed of, growing up. [ Scoffs ] I know what he wants from me. What does he want from you? Wish I could figure that out. I never busted him. I remember the face of everybody I ever booked. Well, maybe he picked you because...He hates cops. Maybe it's rando. No. Nothing about this guy is random. Nothing that's happened between him and me is an accident, I know that. There's a connection there somewhere. I just -- I saw that befor. What the hell is it? [ Chuckles ] Talk about somebody fucking up your entire life. Detective Lucas, I'd like to talk to you about something of a more personal nature. [ Clock ticking ] That's fine. Go ahead. December 5, 1999. Your mother was found murderd on that date. That's correct. [ Rustling ] [ Crunching, smacking lips ] Who wrote it? The person who killed my mother. It was left at the crime scene. The case was never solved. Can you talk about how that murder -- how that affects your job? Well, I think, if anything, it's made me a better cop. And why is that? Well, when I go to see somebody whose entire word has been taken away by some asshole... Who doesn't give a shit whether he's killing somebody's mother... Or father, or daughter - whatever, you know -- maybe they just looked at them the wrong way, you know? And he pulls the trigger. He snuffs out that light forever. Well... I know what those peope are feeling, you know? I know what they'e going through. Does that make sense? Yeah. Makes a lot of sense to me, Jack. [ Smacks lips ] [ Telephone beeps, dialing ] [ Telephone ringing ] Lucas. [ Telephone beeps ] [ Dial tone ] Oh, my god. [ Clock chiming, ticking ] [ Telephone rings ] What do you want, you fucker? Hey. Jeez, Jack, do you always answer the phone that way? You're gonna drive your callers off. Eddie? Yeah. Well, you told me to give you a call if those knuckleheads came in again. You know, the, uh, French maid, the one with the great ass? Uh, yeah. Well, uh, she stopped in and I carded her. Now, do you want her address, or you want to go on talking nasty to me? [ Water spraying ] What was that last name again, please? I think it's chadwicke, with an "e." You know, when you first pulled up, I thought you were gonna ask me to wash your car. Yeah. Uh, you say you were in his acting class? Yeah. He's a great actor, but he's a little weird, if you ask me. We did this scene in class once, and I went to his house to rehearse. You say you went to his house? [ Vehicle approaching ] [ Gate clanking ] [ Engine turns over ] [ Tires screech ] My, my, my. Aren't we clever? Hello, there, Ollie, old pal. Nice to see you, too, Jack. Would you move your car, please? Get out of the car. You're under arrest. [ Chuckles ] You're arresting me? For what? Murdering Dexter? Hardly worth it. He died sniveling -- get out of the fucking car! Jack! Easy! Jack, please! I have neighbors. You gonna fuck me now, Jack? Is that it? Shut the fuck up. [ Leash jingling ] I haven't done anything! Call the police! [ Dog barking ] Ma'am, I am the police. This is under control here. Thank you. Oh, god, he's killing me! [ Barking continues ] You have the right to remain silent. [ Handcuffs ratcheting ] Anything you say can ad will be used against yu in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorne, the state will provide you one at no cost to you. These are your rights. Do you understand them, you piece of shit? [ Exhales ] Yes, I do. Gifford: Let me just understad what you're saying... You're waiving your constitutional right to counsel, is that correct? I'm an innocent man. I don't need a lawyer to tell you that. [ Sighs ] Why'd you kill Joe Dexter? I have no acquaintance with any Joe Dexter, much less a reason to kill him. Yo, Jack. Man, I did -- I did the rundown on this guy like you asked. This is it? Okay. Jack's gone now. Feel free to open up a little, okay? We checked everything, man. He's clean. Man, I even ran the plates on his caddy -- not even a fucking parking ticket. Transfer of ownership from previous owner Franklin billow four years ago. That's it. Doesn't make any sense. He gave it up already? No, this motherfucker's a character. Now, I got to admit -- he's creative -- that's for sure. [ Inhales sharply ] Have dorland come down here with his machine. Dorland? He waived counsel and agreed to a polygraph? How'd you pull that one off? No, he requested it. [ Jack scoffs ] [ Machinery scratching ] Mr. Chadwicke, do you own a Cadillac? I do. Call me old-fashioned, but I like to buy American. Yes or no, please. Yes. Did you know Joe Dexter? No. [ Scratching continues ] Did you ever meet Joe Dexter? Never. Did you telephone detective Lucas here at the station yesterday evening? Yes. Why? Detective Lucas and his girlfriend, Jessica tarrant, are engaged in a plan to blackmail me. Ms. Tarrant is a.. Well, there are ladies present, so I'll just say she's an exotic dancer, but that should tell you enough right there. Anyway, after their failed and clumsy attempt at extortion, I assume they are now trying to frame me for the murder of this Joe Dexter perso. Oh, give me a -- oh. See, I told you -- it's rich, ain't it? What was the nature of the conversation between you and detective Lucas? Well, I...admittedly have, on one or two occasions... Visited Ms. Tarrant's club. And I tend to tip rather heavily. It's a weakness of mine. Anyway, Ms. Tarrant became... Fixated on me, for lack of a better wor. I think she smelled mone. My family's quite wealthy. It makes me something of a target. Let's stick with the conversation between you and detective Lucas, please. Yes, of course. I simply told detective Lucas that I knew very well what he and Ms. Tarrant were up to, and that if he thought he was gonna get away with it, he was sorely mistake. It's not the first tie that somebody's tried something like this. You cannot imagine the kind of scum that comes out of the woodwork. Stick with the conversation, please. Detective Lucas became abusive, and I was forced to hang up. I'm not believing this. I mean, this fucker is lying through his teeth. Oh, come on, cap, you're not buying this piece-of-shit story. I mean, this -- this is all just a -- a fucking smoke screen. Ask him where he was the night Dexter got kille. Mr. Chadwicke... Where were you the night Dexter was killed? At home. I was...Watching one of my mother's old films. I have them all on videotape. It reminds me of what she was like. I still feel her loss as if it were yesterday. You know, I read the papers. I've heard about this department's questionable ethics and tactics -- rogue cops and whatnot, but this... This is unacceptable. Once again, Mr. Chadwicke... Did you murder Joe Dexter? Why would I murder a man that I have never met? Yes or no? No. [ Scratching continues ] Absolutely not. Jack... [ Footsteps retreat ] [ Clicks, scratching stops ] Well, you may not want to hear this. Bridges, let's have it. In my opinion, he's telling the truth. I don't see how. Jack said he admitted to killing Dexter, and I believe him. Look, there's something off about this guy. I think he knows how to beat your machine. It's impossible. Unless he's so crazy he believes everything he's saying, he's telling the truth -- bottom line. Sorry. Cut him loose. Mr. Chadwicke... Hmm? You're free to go. Hmm. Catch me if you can. The fuck did you just say?! Ugh! Ugh! You murdering fuck! Ugh! Jack! Jack, come on! Bressler, can you get him?! Jack! Jack! Get off me! All right, get off me! Hey, get him out of here! Get him out of here, bressler! All right, I got him, man. Now I know -- now I know! Do you hear me?! Get him out! All right, come o. [ Sniffles, sighs ] My hands are tied. That's the city's official position. [ Sniffling ] Okay. Thank you. Mr. Chadwicke... Uh-huh. Okay, here's what we're willing to do. Uh, the department will pay for all hospital expenses, um, any other restitution you may need. As for pressing charges, I hope you'll reconsider. This man injured me. He humiliated me in front of my neighbors. I know. I am -- I'm -- I'm very sorry. And -- and he's sorry, too. And his temper -- um, that aside, I think that we do better to handle things within the department. The department? The department's a disgrace. I'm filing charges. Well, you don't -- I'll tell you something else, sir. I have many friends in the media as well as on the county board of supervisors. And it is well-known that you have your eye on the chief's job when he steps down next year. I'll thank you to wipe that smirk off your face. I want this man placed under arrest immediately, or I will make some phone calls, make your life a living hell! Okay. All right. You have my word. Good. [ Footsteps retreating ] [ Telephone beeping, door closes ] [ Door opens ] [ Clears throat ] Door. Yeah, pruitt. What? [ Latch clicks ] Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. [ Ashes sizzling ] I see. What about the DNA? The -- the second it comes in, you let me know. All right. Bye. [ Receiver clicks ] There's a security guad at the playpen, says he saw the murdered girl get into your car last nigh. That makes you, jac, the last person to see her alive. Greg, how long have you known me, huh? You can't really believe I killed this girl. That's not the issue. Let's put that aside. This guy -- this character -- chadwicke... You should have seen what you did to his nose. He wants your ass real bad. All right? Real bad. Yeah, so, what are you saying to me? What I'm saying, Jack, is we've been getting the shit kicked out of US in the press recently. If I don't stop the bleeding now, it's gonna turn into a media circus. Look... I know you've been going through hell recently. I feel for you. But... I got to ask for your gun. Come on. That's the way we do it. [ Exhales heavily ] [ Sighs ] And the other one -- the beretta -- where is it? [ Vehicles passing ] It's at home. Why? I took it to the range the other night. I noticed a, uh, a crak in the slide. I was gonna take t to the armorer. Look, I can go and get it, all right? It'll only take me an hour. If you're worried, you send gifford with me. One hour. Go. Don't leave me hanging, Jack. [ Door closes ] [ Vehicle approaches ] [ Brakes squeaking ] [ Keys jingling, engine turns off ] Be right back. She's there, isn't she? The girl? You didn't take her to no damn shelter. No. [ Sighs ] I knew it. He would have found her there, Carla, all right? He could have gotten to her like that, easy. You are not helping yourself any. Damn, Jack, sometimes I wonder if you want to go down. Look, let me explain something to you. I'm gonna help you out as much as I can, okay? But I won't go down with you. I can't do that to my family. I wouldn't want you to. All right, as long as we understand each other. This will just take a few minutes. Damn, if that's all it takes, I feel sorry for her. [ Laughing ] Just trying to lighten things up a little, okay? [ Car door closes ] Ahh. [ Door opens ] I don't have a lot of time, so grab your things and come with me, okay? Why? Just do it, please. Jack, tell me what's going on. He killed my mother, Jess -- my mother, Dexter, Sandy. He's the one who wrote this. Oh, my god. Now, there's no question in my mind that you're next. This fucker knows everything about me. He knows where I live, and I'm pretty sure he's figured out that you're here by now, so can we, please? But I'm allergic to cats. I promise you you'll never see the fucking thing. It hides under the bed all day. Listen, once you're in here, don't come back out. Don't let anybody in but me. What if your neighbor comes back? What do I say? She won't. She's gone all week. [ Engine grinds ] [ Sighs ] [ Engine turns over ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Frédéric chopin's "etude in e major op. 10 no. 3" plays ] [ Latch clicks ] [ Exhales sharply ] [ Clock chimes ] [ Paper rustling ] [ Drawer opens ] [ Whistling ] [ Drawer closes ] [ Whistling continues ] [ Ice rattling ] [ Paper rustling ] I got you, you little fuck. [ Telephone rings, whistling continues ] [ Beeps, static ] [ Sighs ] [ Static continues ] [ Whistling ] [ Floorboard creaks ] [ Doorbell rings ] Yes? Man: Fedex. Can you just leave it, please? I need a signature. Sorry. Of course you do. Coming! [ Music ends ] [ Whistling ] [ Horn honking ] [ Engine revving, tires screech ] Jack? Dad, I'm in trouble. I need your help. What kind of trouble? Just get in, please. I'll tell you on the way. Where are we going? Your place. I need to borrow something. Jack, what in the hell's going on? The kid in this picture -- was he ever a patient of yours at shackleton? Jesus Christ. Where in the hell did you get this? So you do know him. Richard Bigelow... Brilliant, brilliant kid... Deeply disturbed... Dark, violent nature. That's his mother, Shannon cane. She was an actress, right? B-movies. More of a pinup girl, really. There were rumors she had an incestuous relationship with her father, and she, uh, carried on the family tradition with her son. Anyway, Bigelow walks in on them one afternoon -- mother and son in all their glory. He tries to separate them, and Richard beats him within an inch of his life. So the old man has the kid committed. Three years later, both parents are dead -- murder/suicide. The father did it. He strangled her, then he shot himself. Richard is named sole beneficiary of the family's fortune -- over $100 million. And he can't touch it. He's enraged. He tried everything -- tried to pretend he had been rehabilitated, but I knew better. What did you do then? I made damn sure he stayed locked up as long as humanly possible. I got the review board to Grant a 10-year stay on any further reviews. Oh, my god. His next review date would have been... A little over two years ago. Oh, god. It's him, dad. "Catch me if you can" -- he said it straight to my face. [ Brakes squeaking ] [ Engine turns off ] [ Police radio beeps ] Man: Perry -- 33 negative. [ Vehicles passing ] [ Rattling ] [ Clicking ] Be careful, son. [ Keys jingling ] [ Engine revving ] [ Footsteps approach ] [ Water running ] [ Police radio beeps ] [ Man talking indistinctly on police radio ] [ Woman talking indistinctly on police radio ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Creaking, water stops running ] [ Telephone rings ] [ Answering machine clicks ] [ Beeps ] Hey, neighbor, it's Caitlin. So, I call in for messages a few minutes ago, and some chick answers the phone. What's up with that? Call me. [ Answering machine beeps ] Oh, fuck this. [ Door closes ] [ Door closes ] [ Floorboards creaking, man talking indistinctly ] Oh, hell, no. [ Door hinges squeaking ] [ Inhales sharply ] Jack, show me your hands. [ Panting ] Is this how you reward people who trust you? [ Gasps ] Carla... Ugh! Shh. You'll scare the kitty. Carla, listen to me. He's in there right now. He's in there somewhere, and if he finds Jessica, he's gonna kill her. Do you hear me? Ahh! Where's Jack? [ Gasping ] Where's your hero? Carla, please, listen to me. Do you remember what you said to me last night about trusting yo? Come on, sweetie. Tell me. If I was guilty, would I come back here, huh?! [ Gasping ] No! [ Muffled ] No! No! No! Carla, please. I'm begging you. [ Gun uncocks ] I swear to god, Jack, I lose my job over this, I'm taking it out on your ass! Call for backup and watch that back exit. [ Muffled ] No! Ugh! Ugh! [ Door hinges squeak ] [ Door closes ] Officer needs assistance -- possible homicide suspect -- 1307 palmetto. [ Exhales deeply ] How the hell do I get myself into this shit? Jess? Jessica? Jessica? [ Gasping ] Jack! Oh! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I got you. Jack! I got you. I'm here. [ Crying ] It's okay. I'm here. I got you. [ Coughing ] I got you. It's gonna be okay. You're okay. [ Panting ] Oh, how sweet. Would you get your hands in the air, please? Up! [ Breathing rapidly ] Quite the rogue cop, aren't you, Jack? Hell of a killing spree you've been on. Too bad it has to end. But...all things must pass. [ Gun cocks ] Would you get on your knees, please? I promise you, you won't feel a thin. Like my mother? Oh, I wish that were true, Jack, but unfortunately, there was quite a bit of pain. If only your father had cooperated, none of this would have been necessary, but...stubborn to the end, I suppose. Mine was the same way. We have that in common. What are you talking about? Oh, Jack, don't you know? It's amazing what you can accomplish in a single night with a lazy orderly and a broken window latch. You won't get away with it this time. My partner's downstairs right now calling for backup. Well, I'll add her to the list. Just think, Jack... When all is said and done, you may go down as one of the city's great serial killers. [ Gun cocks ] Say a little prayer. Gifford: Drop it. [ Gun cocks ] Drop it. No. [ Panting ] [ Woman talking indistinctly on police radio ] You take care of her. I'm gonna secure that gun. Thanks. You're gonna be okay, honey. [ Crying ] I need an ambulance -- 1307 palmetto. Ugh. Ugh. [ Groaning ] [ Gun cocks ] [ Vehicle approaching ] Out of the car, and nobody gets hurt. Cool, cool. [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot echoes ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Gunshots ] [ Glass shattering ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Engine grinding ] Come on! [ Tires screeching ] Come on! God damn it! [ Engine revving ] [ Grinding continues ] And I thought my car was a piece of shit! [ Engine revving, tires screeching ] [ Gun cocks ] [ Gunshots, glass shattering ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Clicks ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Engine revving ] [ Horns honking ] [ Engine revving ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Tires screeching, horns honking ] [ Glass shattering ] [ Engine revving ] [ Gunshots ] [ Tires screeching, indistinct shouting ] [ Horns honking ] Whoa! Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [ Tires screeching ] Oh! Aah! [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Gunshots ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Engines revving, tires screeching ] Oh! Oh! Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Whoa! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! Aah! Aah! [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Sirens approaching ] Man, look, don't shoot! Get out of here! Move! Move! [ Indistinct shouting ] Shall we add her to the tally, Jack? After all, this is your gun. Why do you want to shoot her, huh? You won. I'm already fucked. You saw to that. You walk away right now, and I'm still going down, just like you planned it. I know what you're trying to do, Jack -- very admirable -- pathetic, but admirable. You really want to talk about pathetic? My father told me all about you, about how your mother used you to get back at daddy. [ Laughing ] That's not true. He's lying. Did it hurt? Did it hurt knowing she was just fucking you to feed her own fucked-up, twisted psyche? I mean, no wonder you're such a little motherfucker, huh? [ Chuckles ] Well, here. Now, come on. Let her go. You win. I told you, Jack, it won't work. [ Shell casing clinking ] [ Thud ] Just did. [ Sirens approaching ]
