Nice suits. You look like Mario clones. I'm teaching these gypsies how to dress. Don't even say it brother, this is very crispy here. Wow, Torito. We came to support you man. Please support me from the audience. Don't worry, we just need a moment of your time. For real Pedro? Pietro, name's Pietro. Dimitri, cheer it up! What a macho! A real macho man! Shit, don't mess up my dressing room. You call this shit hole a dressing room? Torito, for real, we wanted to wish you luck with…what's his name? Satan. Satan?! Fuck off, the other asshole's name is SATAN? Uh so, the other wrestler is the Devil? Wrestler not! Fighter! This isn't like that other circus. Torito, come here champ, it's important. Come. Come, come. Is your victory in danger? No way Mario. Are you sure? I want to see those reflexes. Let's see. Look at this hand, look at this hand. You didn't see it comin'! You aren't seeing it comin. What's wrong with you? You're slow man, you're slow! -What's up? React, react, react. Toro. You are ready. Is this asshole De Niro or Pacino? Shit, you fucking Russian. Don't fucking touch my dressing room! You all get out now! Shit, what pains in my ass. - And? - Ready. -Done -Yup…we did it. - So? - Dimitri? I feel…you know what? All of this… I better wait for you guys in the bar. - Ok. - I'll call you. - I'll call you…ok - Let's go. Excuse me… Hey, Romero! You and I have some unfinished business. You owe me something and you know it. - Chill man, I'll buy you that beer. Don't worry I'll get it to you. That's just a friend of mine, just ignore him. - Shit - Mamma Mia Fuck…Alvaro, please tell me that is not going to happen to our Torito! -This is a zero risk operation, trust me. -Shit man, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll catch up with you later. Did you see that? That guy was dead. Good evening! Wilson, wait for me outside, there are too many guys in here. Tell me Andres, did you like the fight? Andrei! Eh? It's Andrei, not Andres. That last guy... they split his head open like a dic... These people, you welcome them and they think they own the country. My friend, tell the nigger that's out there to bring me a towel like the one... ...they gave the Russian, do me the favor. Mario, someone's looking for you Uf. Hey there pussy cat. Ciao Kandi, good evening. Mario, to be honest, this place is a real dump isn't it? - A dump? - Yeah, I mean even for you guys. Any place is good for doing business, don't you think? Is he here? Just in time to talk some art. Well, I don't think I'll get bored then, by the way…nice suits. - Thanks. - When you can, please bring me the menu. Ha, ha, ha, sweet and lovely. I can't stand your wife. Ex wife. It's complicated. Who's that girl? Chill champ, it's the Russian's girl. She's out of your league. But you've always told me that there's nothing out of league. Alvarito I was referring to myself. For you it's a bit more… - Difficult. - Maybe if you were a little bit... - taller… - Or if you had a bit more... - Class. - Class…or… Bambina. For real? How can you guys do that to me? Don't you tell me. Hey, but you were running around my house naked last week. Sweetheart, you couldn't handle this... ...and without being able to handle this, you even wanted to “handle” two more! And you? My so called brother. I've already been told, fratello. Listen guys, I don't want to kill the vibe here but… …I came across Andrei in the bathroom and.. ...that guy is a dangerous man, that guy is an asshole. I don't want to think that now, because of us, Espin… Hey, chill man, that has been taken care of. Chill man?! Grab that asshole's money for this crap? Brilliant man! Hey girls! What's up? And .Eva? We're going to go have a drink afterwards? Yes, yes. Why so late man? Yeah. One has to take advantage of the muse's arrival. When you see the painting I did, you'll fall on your ass. If it's like the last one, I am sure it is ass. My little Mario, you're so basic. When will you learn that typical beauty is boring? That the important thing is to find what inspires you. - I like exotic beauty, the inspiration… - Bullshit… Bless you. - Relax. - What's wrong with this guy? Hey… were you able to…? Relax…look. Shit. It looks like the brazilian have invested into this circus. Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to the stellar fight of the night. With you tonight is a fighter with a record... ...of 41 victories and zero defeats. The only undefeated champion of the Punta Cana circuit. With you the king of pain. Winston “The Raging Bull” Espin. This guy looks too alert. Ladies and gentleman. Last but not least, approaching the hexagon of the Punta Cana circuit, with a record of ten wins and zero defeats. All won by knock out. - With you, The Tiny Giant! - Tiny? Satan Azcona. Wow, that guy is a beast. He won't beat that monster, not even wide awake. Let's go Espin! - But he's tiny! - Yeah tiny. A midget. For real Alvaro?! You pawned Dimitri's bar to bet on a midget? They're called “little people”. Yeah yeah yeah. You go Toro! Listen up! I want a clean fight. No low blows. You know the rules. Ready? Get in your corners. Let's go Torito! Fight! Grab his neck Satan! - There it goes! - It better, you asshole! Squeeze it! The elbow! Push it! Push it! - Oh man, Torito sure is taking a hit! - We'll compensate him! Low blow. Low blow. Low blow! He hit him! He hit him! Toro! Toro! Let's go Torito! We didn't see that one coming man! Hey baby! Good thing you came 'cause this is your shit! And this, who ordered it? Fucking hell! For how long has this asshole been here? He got here just a little while ago. I'll take it to him. Hans! Ivanov! I thought you were there at the fight, taking care of your investment. Naah! I don't like violence. Anyway, it's not necessary. I trust my fighter. So it seems, based on the amount of money you handed me. Hans, I was thinking. Is there a way to lower the bet? It's that…well, 300 thousand dollars is a lot of money. It's a joke Hans! Of course its a joke. Relax. Anyway the fight has surely already started and… ...enjoy your drink huh? Relax. Heeey! What's up guys? Sebas…Alvaro. Why the fuck don't you answer the god-damn telephone? Dimitri…Well, the thing is that I…Alvaro... Tell me something, tell me that these assholes have that look on their faces... ...because we're not gonna get paid today, but will get pay tomorrow. No man, don't do this to me guys. Don't tell me that we lost all the money. Don't tell me that we lost my bar! Damn it Alvaro, you told me that there was zero risk. - Don't tell me that Espin… - Won! He won? What do you mean he won? Yeah, he beat some dwarf. A dwarf? What do you mean a dwarf? It's that Satan was… tiny. No, he wasn't tiny. The guy was a dwarf, man. - A keychain. - A bonsai. Molto Piccolino. A micro-machine, but one of the smaller ones… Fuck. They call them… little people. Sons of bitches… look at that asshole and you're gonna to tell me that he won? - Hey! - Champion! Where is my macho man? - Sit down! - You killed it man! Let's see Espin. Tell me, what happened to the other guy!? How do you feel? 41 fights, and no one has ever laid finger on me! Suddenly today, out of nowhere I got dizzy. And nauseous. And super fucking tired. The only difference... ...is that I saw you guys in the dressing room before the fight. What a coincedence. But what's important is that you won! Hey! Toro won! Tequila for everyone! Tequila. Serve yourselves a round guys! This fucker pays! I'll pay for the round, I'm going to go talk to… What are we going to do now? What are you going to do to pay Andrei, because if you don't, Alvaro, he gets to keep my fucking bar! Really easy right? Zero risks you asshole? Turning 300 thousand fucking dollars into 1 million in one single operation. What the fucking fuck Alvaro! Wouldn't it have been easier to ask Espin to throw the fight? Man you know he doesn't like to cheat, first he kills us man, you know him and… ...I am not going to loose my fucking bar. I don't know how the hell you're gonna do it, but you're going to get that money. Let me resolve this, just give me time. I know I can do it, just wait. Alvaro, when they come for the money, I will send them to you. Zero risk right? Zero. I have told you many times that I have my coffee at 9 on the dot, not at 8:59, not at 9:01, AT 9 o'clock! Sorry Mr. Moncho, it's that Mrs Norma wanted me to give her a sponge bath. Bitch. Well. Let's forgive you then. God. What a scrawny bitch. And, did she ask about me? Actually no Mr. Moncho, she was really… ...enthusiastic. What can I say… He's so cute that dog. I should buy one. Your coffee is getting cold. Let's go, Let's go Look, I have to call that guy so he can finish this painting. Want me to call him? Man don't be such an ass kisser! Stop brown nosing. Tell him to come tomorrow. Wilson! Hurry, the bitch is calling you. Here, take this cup. Hey man I'm outta here, these waves aren't worth shit. All right man, bye Well, check out the good life this guy has… so relaxed. For someone who's in deep shit and drowning in it. So you're here to tell me that I either pay or get my head bashed in… Bashed in? No man, that's not my department. That department belongs to my little friend over there. That big guy loves to kill and eat the dead. Not me man, I am purer than a white cat. I'm a simple accountant, who came to discuss the payment dates. That's what the Russian told me, your little friend at the bar, right? - Is it, or is it not like that? - It is. Well then, you have 2 months, 60 days to finish this bullshit, right? We'll talk later. Wait… look at those hot chicks. The glamorous life of a professional lifeguard. Repeat after me: surf instructer. Sure, your parents have one of those little diplomas, right? Yeah, right next to your masters in tempera and clay. Touché. Shall we grab a beer? Alvarito, I'm here because we all think, the group, we were talking about you and we all agree, that it's enough, that it's over, that we have to get our ass's in gear, that we have to work, for real. And we mean you. I have the paintings, Mario has the gallery, Pietro the store, - Espin the airline, - Espin is a flight attendant. Well yeah, but he has something. And you? Alvarito, its over. Anyways, if there's anything I can do... Buenanio. What's up Wilson? How is Moncho? No, no. Whenever you say! Tomorrow? Yeah, what time? See you tomorrow. Cool. So… What? And who was that? Moncho? Yeap. Well, his assistant. I'm painting some portraits for him and will work on it tomorrow. And…so what exactly does Moncho do? It appears as if he is does well. Well, he is married to some rich bitch, sells jewelry, guns, he sends people to Puerto Rico, I don't know. It's better not to even know. No, no, dude, no way! He's a dangerous mobster. Even worse than the Russians. This guy is an idiot. Well, maybe you have a better idea. Wait, let me see if I understand. Take money from a degenerate crook to hand it over to another? Have you lost it man? No, for real, you think that's a good plan? Hello Buenanio, the painter. What's up Wilson? So who are these two? They're with me. So what's the matter Wilson? - The painter brought two more. - Two more painters? Let me see. Oh yeah! Let them in. Two little hotties Hey, I introduce you and that's it for me. I have nothing to do with this. You guys trust me or not? What's up Wilson. How are you dear? Always so adorable! - Come in, come in. - Thanks. This way. Wilson! Who are these gentlemen? They have come to finish the paintings. Have them come closer so I can see them better. Normita. My love, come here. Rub it, rub it! You have abandoned me. You naughty boy! I see you've missed me, haven't you? I have to work but I leave you with my friends, Alvaro. Pietro. Welcome to our humble home, gentlemen. Norma. My pleasure ma'am. Hello. My servant tells me that you've come to do business with my husband. It's the only thing he is interested in, his business and his money. Well, my money. I am sure that they make love. I have always been very adventurous, you know. I like to experiment. Toys. Groups. That's how I met my husband. Wilson! Let's go! Be sure to come back! Wilson, rum for the boys! Wilson, move boy! Drink, drink, all of the artist's friends are friends of mine. But it's 9 de la matina, this is crazy. Handsome, are you Italian? At heart. I like your... ...style. Very “caché”. Cheers, thank you Mr. Moncho. Drink. My tango boy. Explain this shit to me. You've never seen him paint? Wilson! The tools. Monchis! Concentrate here on me. Yeah yeah! I'll be right with you, just a minute. Argentino, this doesn't go in the painting, this is because they came to talk business. You guys need some money, right? Yeah. But it's not just 2 cents that you want. Well… Ah yes…the cup, the cup. There? There! If you'll allow me, I would like to tell you a story. Once upon a time there where 2 friends, 2 very good friends, who really liked... ...to fish. They borrowed a beautiful yacht, on a beautiful day... ...and went out to the sea. They sailed and sailed... ...until they found a good place for bottom fishing. Monchis! Of course, of course, of course. There? There! The day was fabulous. The fish where biting. The beers were flowing. And they kept drinking and drinking and drinking some more. But they didn't realize... ...that it was getting late. They anchored and decided to spend the night... ...on the high sea. The starry sky. The movement of the waves. The breeze of the sea. The champagne. And just like that one thing led to another. Oh man. Now... ...the question is, which one of you likes... ...to fish? Look mother fucker. Are you fucking nuts? Take it easy, nobody will have to go fishing! Listen to yourself Alvaro! I Is that your big fucking idea? To ask…Walter Mercado and his fishing husband for money? Don't you fuck around, damn it! Pedro, Pedro! The name is Pietro, Alvaro! Pietro Francesco! And I'm going to be in the shop being Pietro Ok! Look man, I'm going to take the money. Good luck with the fishing, fratello. Make it a double. Let's see, Spain, so what's the name of that shit? This shit is called “The Complex Art of Living”. Do you like it? Shit man, I take my hat off to you. You are the only person who can sell the crap that that Argentine paints. Oh dear Alex, selling art is a question of attitude. Let me explain it to you. The trick is in making you think I have something... ...that I don't want you to have. Because you won't be able to pay for it. Or worse, you won't understand it. And in most cases what I have doesn't actually matter. It doesn't matter. I don't get it. “The Complex Art of Selling Art”. Well in the end, they'll pray that you'll sell it to them. And I pray that you get that shit off my bar or I'll break it over your head. Pedrito, Pedrito, tell me, have you seen that stupid lifeguard? Pietro. Sorry, sorry. It's that it seems ironic. “The Lifeguard” and this dude have a noose around his neck. You better stop fuckers! Everyone plays the joker when it's someone else who's getting screwed? But let me tell you something, I am not going down alone. We are all involved in this. - This is what I know about… my paintings - You all go fuck yourselves. Fuck your goddamn selves! We are all partners here. And Andrei, will know that. - No, I never said that. - Don't count on me. One small problem and you all wanna bail. - What's in that bag? - What's inside the bag, lifeguard? Didn't I tell you to trust me? To trust him. Tell them Alvarito, tell them what's in the bag. Tell them who lent you the 300 thousand dollars. Who did you fuck now? El Moncho lent it to him. El Moncho? Tell me you're kidding… El Moncho. Brother, you graduated man. Well done… toasted forever. Hey. I told him we were going to buy this bar. - We?! - This bar? Andrei's bar? How many times are you going to try to sell a bar that isn't your's. Listen Spain, this bar is mine. And you, Now I'm going to fucking kill you. Take your chill pills. Relax. The only thing I'm going to need is…your help. How strange. Especially from… Oh no… no, no, no no, no. Go ask for help to your mama, you figlio di puttana. Hello, excuse me. We are looking for Esteban. I don't know any Esteban. Esteban, tall black guy with dreadlocks. Give me two beers and we are looking for “The Yardstick”. The bar is closed, and The Yardstick is over there. That wasn't worth 20 dollars. Don't make it that easy Caracas. Here, go it's your turn. Damn I don't like small bets. Hey what's up man? What the hell is this idiot is doing here. Relax we're here to talk business. Calmly. Business? The last business I did with your little boyfriend... ...left me broke and in jail. I haven't kicked his ass yet because of you my friend. But I told you that the Spanish bitch was yours and... You son of a bitch! Wait, relax. Come, come here. And he dares to speak. Wait, give him a chance, all right? Come here. Only for you. So tell me. What's the deal now? Are you still working in the VIP of the casino? Yeap. Neither you, Juan Carlos or Ernesto have credit. I ran out of money, you guys buy the next round. 'Cause I'm not rich. - Grazzie. - What time does the table open? The Yardstick said at mezzanotte. Mezzanotte dude? What happened? What? No…no. No what? I am asking you guys, please, nothing to drink. What happened man? What happened? Joselo and I where talking. Who's Joselo? Cut it with the “Italian” bullshit 'cause it's starting to piss me off. Joselo, my trainer… ...he and I were talking. Someone poisoned me on the day of the fight. Naaaah, that can't be! Are you still thinking about that Toro? They fractured 3 of my ribs. It still hurts when I pee. He dislocated my shoulder. A dwarf! I still think about that. And Joselo said that it was you guys. No! Hey cuties. Did you guys see who's over there? Where? There! At the VIP. Technically we are still married. It's complicated. It doesn't matter. Alvaro. Look who's coming! That's the Russian right? Yeah, that's the Russian. Let's go. But you said she was out of my league. Since when do you follow advice? Go get her Alvaro. - She's your prey, Alvaro. - Alvaro, don't… Damn it! That's it! Alvaro! Chest out! Watch, watch! Would you like a drink? Wow. It's been a long time since someone has dared to buy me a drink. Oh yeah? That's weird. Everyone here knows who I'm with. Cheers. I know what you're thinking. 'M not thinking of anything, only that if I were him... Let's see, if you were him you would treat me like a queen. Something like that. Andrei treats me like a queen. Well in that case my name is Alvaro. Your highness. Ivana. We have a name. And what is Ivana doing so far from her motherland? I fell in love very young. We met in Marbella where Andrei was the king of the night. He was…is… a charming man. He promised me adventure… He told me we would travel the world. And you ended in Punta Cana? Andrei is a bit… older. I liked older men. An unresolved paternal complex. You liked older men? Over time I've realized that with maturity men... ...become cautious, predictable, boring. It doesn't matter how many girls you try to fuck in a night. - Mezzanotte. - Are you leaving? I haven't come here to chat. Bedtime? Sorry… What did you come here for? Poker. - Damn it Pedro! - No! Damn you Alvaro! We said we where going to review the plan and you come to hit ont the Russian. - Man it's just that, that woman is so… - Focus Alvaro. The door opens in less than 10 minutes. So let's go. We will go in and present the invitation that The Yardstick got us. - And the money bag? - Of course. We will sit down with 150 thousand dollars each. And will you be Dominican or Italian in there? 300 mile. 10% belongs to the house. One or two posts? Due Thank you. - Good luck. - Grazzie Sir. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Alvaro. And Pietro. …(Speaking Italian) Si... Welcome gentlemen and lady. This is no limit Texas hold em. And the bids start at 50 and 100 dollars. Lady and gentlemen, shall we begin? Good luck! Fifth card. The lady and the gentleman win. Thank you 10 thousand. - Are you in or not sir - I'm in. - And you? - 30 thousand. Fifth card. The gentleman wins. Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Forgive me, I apologize. Fifth card? (mumbling Italian) Don't screw around Alvaro. Don't force it. Let's go. All right… good night. Oh, I see, now it's bedtime. Good night. Now the blinds increase to one and two thousand dollars. Hi Sebas, just getting here? Ah yes. It's been a long night when the muse helps. Look at it… - No… - Yes… - No, I mean, no. The woman that does braids on the beach? Yes. Braids… And the guys? Alex left with two chicks. Mario and Candy left together. What's up with that? It's complicated. Wait… Dude, the lifeguard? Did he already fuck it up? Now the blinds increase to five and ten thousand dollars. Goodnight. I'm in. 300 thousand. It's getting late, we should leave. I'll play this last round and go. All in. Fourth card. Stop! (Speaking german) One moment gentleman. Esteban, Esteban… Esteban. You have done well today, but with your permission, or everyones permission. I would like to deal the last hand... ...to show clarity and respect to our guests today. It sounds like a strange offer for such an important hand. Really? I think…so. I don't know what the rest of the guests will think about... Please! Go ahead Mr.Bleiner. Like always, a great host. Of course Mr.Bleiner. It would be an honor. Still any doubts, young man? No. Like the lady said, it would be an honor. Let's proceed. We were being super lucky! We didn't even have to do any tricks. We had about 1 million dollars in chips right in front of us. I said… don't force it Alvaro! Let's go, don't force it… (Speaking Russian) What? The cards fall both ways. Luck only requires time. Well, this guy loves dogs. - Dogs? - Huskies, siberians. Especially the one he has in his house. That's nothing, I had a poodle in Puerto Rico. Damn, I really miss Chucho man. Go through there. What's so special about a poodle if they're everywhere? No, this wasn't just any poodle! Chucho was a brain, man! The only thing he couldn't do was talk! You buy a carton of milk and they give you 3. Not this one man! And he was so racist. Are poodles racist? I don't know if all of them are but if this one saw a Dominican... ...he wouldn't look him in the eyes. One time he bit Espin and wouldn't let go. - He bit Toro? - Yeap, Toro - Do you know what the fucker did? - What? Man he grabbed Chucho by the tail, spinned him around and slammed him against the wall. Never barked again. Now every time Espin hears Chucho's name he gets nervous. Do you want me to tell you the story or not? Well go ahead, start. I heard this from one of the Russians bodyguard so don't say anything. - From SeLgei? - -Sergei, as in BEING gay…Ser Gay Everything happened when the Russian started his “organization”. The Russian had a partner who was in charge of organizing meetings... ...with gun buyers in the black market, ok? This client… was his brother. They ran a business that seemed to be doing well, you know, with all those little wars that were going on in Africa. What the Russian didn't know was that his brother... ...was about to betray him. Man his own brother, what a jerk. But what his brother and the rest didn't know… ...was that this dog was there, hidden… ...aware of everything that was happening. Hold it there! you're not going to tell me that the dog saved him?! Not only did he save him, but he captured his treacherous brother alive. Alive? Wow, how generous! That's why it's so hard to find a Russian working with him. What about the dog? Did he live? Listen, of course he lived! What's ironic is that the dog wasn't dying because he had been shot at, No! He dodged the bullets. The dog was dying because of the heat in Punta Cana. Damn, that sucks. That's why the Russian keeps the dog in a cold room. - Nice and cold. - In a fridge? - Like a beer. - Doesn't he freeze man? Nope, that dog knows how to control the temperature, he barks twice and the temperature changes. Idiot. What do you mean he controls the temperature? Yeap. This dog is amazing. So he's just as smart as Chucho. Dude, what do you mean forget about Chucho. This dog is royalty. That's why Sergei told me the Russian loves nothing or no one... ...as much as he loves this dog. - Dogs are just too cool. - The Russian is in love with his dog. I was in love with Chucho too, they don't betray you. What the fuck? Darling, you have a telegram. - Alvaro! - Is he home? Wait, so on top of it all this guy killed his own brother? As if he where chewing gum. But he asked for it, right? - He asked for it. - Alvaro. Look, his motorcycle is over there. So he's home. Alvaro! Alvaro! Hey, look man. Try it. Hello?! - Alvaro! - Shit! Look at this mess! - Don't touch that! - I'm not touching it. Relax. Check this out bro' Not bad for someone who doesn't even have pictures of his own family! He loves us. Damn it smells gross. Hey! Either he has a huge cat or despite the smell, he's still alive! What is this? - Do you think that's him? - Of course it's him you idiot. Let's give him a little light! Don't kill me, don't kill me, I will get the money! Well, Einstein. So what's your brilliant plan? Stay here until everything fixes itself or what? - Leave me alone! - Leave you alone? Yeah, yeah…and close that damn curtain man. C'mon dude get out of that bed man. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Do you remember Chucho? Yeah, that racist dog of yours? He wasn't racist! He was… selective. - Ugly fucking mutt. - Man I miss him so much! Don't you remember how he used to surf with me on the long board? He was really fucking cute. - Then go surf with him. - He's dead you fucker! God damn it! Would you like it a little warmer sir? Really? So, tell me, what's the master plan? Nah Alex, there isn't a master plan. There's no move. I have nothing in mind. All I've been doing is thinking… ...about going fishing with Moncho. Sounds like a great plan to me. - Mario Let's go! - No wait. Today is the most important day at my gallery. I finally have one of Nabukov's expositions. There will be pretty people, money, opportunities! I have plans for tonight. Do you? What plans? Pizza and suicide. Another great plan. Seriously let's go Mario! - Wait… - No way man! No way! Come on Alvaro! Lets get well dressed... ...take advantage of the prices of the drinks. Let's go like good old times. Yeah? Mario, don't you understand that... ...nothing is going to be like “good old times”? I failed my friends. I offered you guys so much and... ...like always, I end up short. Really short. Just go and leave me alone. Ivanna will be there. This guy is amazing! You can really see the pain of his departure. The nostalgia of the absence... ...with presence of his motherland... ...in every corner of the painting. It's as if… ...tears have diluted the colors. Sad strokes, yet brave. That leave us with this beauty. That invite us to reflect. So we can understand the meaning... ...of his agony of being alive but... ...far away from home. Bravo. I see a dog. What did Sebas say about the dog? See?! What's with the look Dimitri? Why are you wearing glasses? Wow wow man. Not here. Alvarito, they were looking for you… ...and they found me you asshole! Oh the note was for you. You son of a bitch! Relax! Let's go get a drink… go on. Everything's nice. Very nice. Hey man, you have to give him time. That man has broken his neck for you... ...a million times and you know it. The thing is… look at me! He feels manipulated. Used. You're welcome. That's a dog. Pedro. Pietro. Pedro, man. I'm gonna resolve this. Sure! Of course you are going to resolve this. Oh wait! Don't tell me. I'm sure it'll be... ...with your grandfather's heritage that's on its way… ...or better yet… ...with all the money that we're going to make... ...with the Italian wine business... ...that you got me into, that ended up being from Uruguay. Paraguay. Well aren't you funny. Do you know that you are fucked Alvarito? That the Russians you fucked with aren't dumb. And your whole disappearing for a month act... ...isn't going to work because they don't want the bar anymore... ...they want their money! Well, well …your best friend. For you everything is a game, right? You came! Yeah but I'm about to leave. Really? You sure? Look… Go ahead! This must be from his impressionistic period. Nabukov didn't have an impressionistic period. I haven't seen you since… Ah, where you looking for me? Maybe. So is Andrei interested in art or… Andrei loves Russian painters. Nabukov is one of his favorites. They share that Russian macho fixation for Huskies. Besides he is looking for a good piece to give to his father. To his father? He lives in Saint Petersburg. He's coming to visit for the first time. We are going to throw him a party. A party… You should come. Is that an invitation? Would you like me to send you an invitation? Why not? Ready, let's go. You bought it? Of course I did, wouldn't miss this opportunity. Excuse me. Do we know each other? Yes, from Hans's poker club. Well. Goodbye. I've been doing some thinking... ...and I think it's time that I come home. I don't think so. You don't think so. I mean since we already sold the painting... ...you don't have to go around anymore... ...you know, you... ...I mean, I don't like seeing you with others. Oh you don't? Oh well. Honey, honestly... ...I have been having so much fun with the way things are. I don't have expectations and... ...that way you don't dissapoint me. But don't worry because… ...anyway the doors of my home will always be open for you. And whenever you want you can stop by and... ...we can get rid of these desires like we do so well. And after that… ...we are just friends and business associates... ...as if nothing has happened. Deal? No… No. Friends and business associates? Mario! Friends and business associates. Well. Cheers. Do you like the doggie? The painting! It has to have something 'cause... ...the Russian looked at it for a long time. What do you think? I don't really want to know that much about dogs. Well I think… I mean the painting is kinda stupid. I like my self-portraits, my selfies. Stuff like that. But if the Russian spent so much time... ...looking at it must have something. Yes. He is very interested. Don't you tell me. Aha. What does the Russian see in this? He said something about... ...putting it in the living room of his house and throw it a party. Throw a party for the painting?! Damn. Do you have something... ...to do with this gallery? Well, my friend… ...my friend Mario Canovas there... ...he and I are business associates. So you're the one to talk to if I want to take home that painting? Yeap…I'm your man. Get me a number, will you? Or should I go myself? No no no! Mr. Moncho stay here. Enjoy the painting. I'll resolve this. I'll be right back. Stay here. Hurry up. (Speaking Arabic) Alvarito how are you? Do you need something? No no… I'm ok. So what? Did you sell the painting? We sold “The Dog from Siberia”. Mmm…For how much? 6. 6 thousand? 600 thousand Alvaro. 600 thousand, not a bad commission for a night's work. That's a lot of money man. Yeah. Hey, everything ok with your associate? Yeah, yeah … it's just that he ran out of champagne and... ...Mr Moncho would like another glass. Another glass? …Of course. I'll send it over. Ok thanks. - So see you tomorrow then? - See ya. Congratulations. Thanks man. -So…what did he say? Well... The Russian is very interested. Fuck. - But… - Aha? He found it a bit too expensive. I knew the guy was a rat. Always bragging about what he has and he hasn't even started. But tell me, what “a bit too expensive” is. 650 thousand dollars. For real partner? You trying to trick me? I, I don't… but I… The guy said 500. Mr. Moncho. 650 for the Russian but 500 for you. Relax, that was the number that I got you. Yeah. 500 thousand dollars for an old painting of a dog. Deal. Deal. …on the longboard he would get in front of me and ah… ...I miss him you know? Chucho. He was the coolest dog in the world. Hey is there room for one more? Hi Eva… ...beautiful bitch. Dude. How long are you going to be mad at me for? I'm not mad at you. I can't be mad at someone who doesn't even exist. Move over there please, you're blocking the sun. Look, I know you think I'm an asshole... ...that I'm irresponsible… ...that I have horrible ideas. But look… I solved it… I know how we're going to pay Moncho and the Russian. Sure thing. Look the only thing I need from you… My help? Two minutes. No. Two. No. Look I swear on my mothers' grave. Your mom is alive dude. I mean when she die. Look, right next to you is the woman of my life. Who I wanted to have children with. The one who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. And you are… Alvaro! Good evening sirs. Check out these dolls. Come here, my friend! Could we talk? You, you can tell me over here. Here? Didn't they teach you it's bad manners to talk... ...about business in front of your friends? Come! Please, come with me you fucker. I'll give him back ok? See you later. Lets have a little chat my friend... Don't you fuck with me Alvaro. I left you a note and I'm tired of calling you! It's that my cellphone drowned. Ha-ha your cellphone drowned! Look you little bitch… I told you I didn't want to take your case to this department. My friend here would love to rip out your stomach and... ...take out your guts and feed them to you. You would look so cute, how cool! Ciao amici! - Let go of him… leave it! - Is there a problem? Look. Two weeks to give us the money! Let's go, it smells like piss around here. Two minutes! So? This guy is screwed man. No Alex, he's not. He's not screwed. - It's an excellent idea. - See… If you want to get your head ripped off. No, no, no! For me it's a great idea. Seriously! Sebastian do you really think it's a good plan? It's a great plan! I've never heard Alvarito state such a good plan before. And besides... ...it will give me the chance to show what a good painter I am. Of course, that's why you're on board with this shitty plan. Time out… time out. Can I speak please? I want to understand, ok? You want to make a copy of the Russians painting... ...a copy from this guy... ...sell itto Moncho pretending to be the original… ...and that's a good plan? - Yeap! - Yeap! Bad trip man. As if Moncho won't be able to tell that it's a copy. No, no no he's an idiot. Seriously you can put a Picasso next to a mural from a pre-school... ...and he won't see the slightest difference. Besides between the original and my copy... ...not even Nabukov will be able to tell the difference. Just give me, let's say… ...three weeks. Well… Great plan. Ciao. Shana! Thanks. Spasiva Shana. “Spasiva” you asshole? “Spasiva”…Thank you, in Russian you ignorant. You sure are a lost cause man. But…exotic isn't she? Yeah, super exotic! You are damaging this group big time man. Well…remember, remember... ...I requested 3 months and... ...you guys only gave me three weeks. And I don't want to make a big deal out of it but... ...I have to take advantage of the occasion. This I have to dedicate especially to the people... ...who didn't trust my talent. Gentlemen… I present… “The Other Dog from Siberia”. So you're going to deliver that? Today. I even rented a van. Oh how great. So, do you have some kind of certificate? A diploma that proves this shit is authentic? Oh look… Mario knows nothing. How nice. Really nice man. You're a real pro. But this is the worst shit I have ever seen. Hey… So? Hey that's going to be huge tonight. Yeah it looks good. Did you guys solve how you're gonna get in? I was invited. Alex is the DJ man, it's all set. Perfect. So tell me what is it we're going to do. Easy. We arrive, we deliver the painting. You keep your mouth shut... And that's it. Ok. Look. Put this on. That little shirt? Yeap. No way that's a small. They made a mistake during the printing. Put it on Winston, please. With you in that suit? Dumbass! Winston Manuel… please put on the shirt. No no, no fucking way! Oh but there's a party today! Wilson! Wilson the painting's here. Wilson! The fucking painting is here! Seriously? I am a well known figure of martial arts in this country. Deal with it, move on. So you want me to carry that alone right? Do it man… do it. Look Wilson. Could it be that the black guy plays for our team? Oh, Mr. Moncho… What an hottie… Hey! How are you Mr. Moncho? You had me worrying partner. I have all of thismone in cash a week ago and... ...you don't call back. It's that we have a lot of deliveries Mr. Moncho... ...but now we're here. Look look. Hey be careful damn it. Be careful! If something breaks I'll fire your ass, damn it! Hat's how you have to talk to these animals! They're so dumb. Wait but… ...I think I've seen that black guy before. Put it here nigga. There. Hey don't call me a nigga, you hear me? Oh how sensitive. Here, hold here. You didn't tell me we would have guests Ramon. I would have dressed better to greet them. What a slut. I'm going to get changed. If anyone would like to help me with my zipper. The door will be open. Well… Back to what we came for. Let's see what I bought for half a million dollars... ...in this day and age. Hey but… ...doesn't this come with a frame or something? We could do that for you back at the gallery. But no, it doesn't come with a frame. Are you sure… ...this is the same painting? Yes Mr.Moncho this is the same painting. The original painting. Relax partner… relax. Just asking. I imagine that you're not stupid enough... ...to try to trick me. Here Mr. Moncho. Here is the certificate of authenticity... ...and a receipt for 500 thousand dollars. If you'd like to void this transaction... ...we can give Mr.Sokolov... ...the opportunity to purchase this masterpiece. Wilson… ...I Nakulov... ...it is garanteed…this painting... The gallery. (indistinct whispering) It says yes. - And the stamp? - Yes, original. Go get the money. The papers look better than the painting, partner. Wilson! Wilson I'm calling you, where are you? Hold this. Here's your money. Count it. That's not necessary Mr. Moncho, you don't have... Listen to me carefully! I trust you more than I trust the papers. Do you want to do this? Look, I will kill your aunt who lives at the border... ...who you don't even know yet. And your little brother Johnny... ...that just moved to Boston with... ...his nine-year-old daughter and three kittens. I will kill them all! I won't even think twice about it… ...kittens included. So… do you still want to do this? Are you sure? Yes sir. Very well. Very well. It has been a pleasure doing business with you and... ...if you'll excuse me I have to go deliver some more paintings. Have a nice evening Mr.Moncho. Wilson. They kick your ass and yet they give you a job? Damn, those Russians are weird. Son of a bitch. You have balls made of steel... ...to be able to show up at this party man. And if I remember correctly, in a couple hours the time's up right? - Brother. - Brother, my ass! Brother, my ass! Look Alvarito. I don't understand that no matter how many times you fuck up… ...I still care about you. - Dude the thing is that… - No! Because had it been for you... I would be serving drinks in a fucking wheel chair. I fixed it. Fixing it would be bringing a bag full of dollars. Yeap. Cause that stupid face of yours... ...won't be enouth for this thugs. And Pedro? Pedro? He's around here somewhere with the love of your life. Oh and for the record… ...later on he'll be fucking her. You came! I wasn't sure you were going to come. I didn't receive an invitation. An invitation is boring anyway. And you're anything but boring. Are you guys friends with Mr. Moncho? With who? Look, show me the house. Yeah. (speaking Russian) Handsome. Cognac with Coke and a little ice. Look sir, this is a tropical party and... ...I would recommend a different drink, A “Sex on the beach”! “Ses on de bich”. Very well. So tell me blondie. Do you like to fish? To fish? Yeah I guess so. Go prepare the drink, then come back so we can talk. So you want me to go to your house with both. - Yeah both of us! - With both of you! There is a painting to reveal. Uh mhm yes. Girls, I present to you my business partner. Business partner, Natacha and … Tatiana. Tatiana. Grow up. Will you wait for me? I won't be long. Brother, bringing sand to the beach? Look, I have the money. So you handed that thing in? Hey nigga. Oh so you don't know me? I told you not to call me nigga didn't I? And I don't know you, so get it straight. How sensitive. We have all the money, well except Moncho's money cause we already paid him. The host says to turn off the music. Good evening. Welcome. You will have to forgive my Spanish. I'll do the best I can. Many years ago I left my country to travel the world... No, come this way We'll see better ...but my country never left me. And even though on these beautiful beaches... ...I have found a house my home stayed there. See? Today I have a piece of my home here with me. Today my father Nikolai Sokolov. Visits me for the first time. And thanks to this exquisite woman… ...my friend Mario Canovas... ...and his art gallery... ...my wife Ivana and I… ...have the honor to present this gift... ...that we know he will love. Oh shit. Dad... Oh shit? ...this is for you. Oh shit! From the great Mikhail Nabukov. “The Siberian Dog”. Thank you my son. Do you see that fucking dwarf? Long live the great Russia! The only thing I've learn to say in English is... ..."This is a party"! Help me find that fucking troll. Come on you don't understand… let's go. Now? Mr.Moncho, what a pleasure to see you. What a nice suit. Mi piace molto su stilo. They're going to kill you how fun! Listen to me! Hide me! Hide me please! Oh yeah! Wherever it doesn't matter! Think! Caché! Mi piace su stilo!

But don't you find it exciting? To die while making love to me. What's behind the white door? Is cold here. Hey man! I warned you to get out. The beast attacked me and… Wait …wait! Get in here! And don't come out until I come back. No! 5 shot at Moncho and 2 at the dog. Don't forget the black guy. Honey I'm cold. What a fucking night man! Tutti out of controle. Here my amore.
