Crown Heights has 200,000 people. 20,000 Jews and 180,000 blacks. People often project negative images about you. Especially if you look different. We have two communities living side by side. But having very little interaction with each other, except when something negative goes down. You could have Lubavitch Hasidims that have many more people living in too small a space, living one on top of another in apartment houses and so on. Um, some people think that Jews have more a piece of the pie. During an economically depressed period, with high crime and stereotypical images on both sides... The white person says, well, no, the blacks are the enemy because they're all on welfare. And they don't want to be nothin', and they're slacks and they're smokers. I don't think black people hate Jews. I think they don't understand us. They don't know what to do with us when they see us. They tend to be so separate. Not just looking separate, but being separate. Some of us don't trust the Jews. Maybe he thinks that I think that I'm better than him because I'm religious, which is the opposite of what I think. They don't like us because, uh, we have our own culture. We look different, we dress different, we have our own ways, you know, and, uh, they can't deal with it. Whenever my son goes to the store, it's as though they don't even want to touch the boy. The accident was not handled properly. Outside agitators came into the, to the community in Crown Heights and caused a lot of trouble. It takes, what, a match, and you got that much gas for it to blow up. Yehuda! Yudi! Yudi! You're going to be late for shul! Y'all hear what happened?! Some Jew kill a black boy, just run him over. What? A kid? Yeah, and the cops let a Jew guy go. Word?That's messed up, man. We're goin' to Kingston to see what goin' on, you seen? How'd that happen? Kingston? What's goin' on down there? Young people! Get off the streets! Keep the peace! Don't be part of the problem! Sorry-ass Uncle Tom, man! Ah, come on, man, he aight. Man, let's go check this out, yo! Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Aw, come on, what about the rhyme? Don't just stand there, come on! So what was your Talmud passage today? Uh, Berachot 60b-- "One must praise God for the bad things that happen, just as you praise God for the good things." That's a tough one. Brother's are goin' off, yo! Yo, man, these brothers, they gonna riot, right? Niggas gonna riot, man! Get home fast, people are going crazy. What's happening?The schvartzes. They're throwing bottles and setting fires. Why is this? Do I know, huh? That's how they are! Good shot, yo! That was... I'm right this minute calling 9-1-1! Get outta here! Shut up! Now, why don't you go on, get off the block! Yo, where you goin', man? Where you going?! Why don't you get off our streets? Please, please, we, we don't want any trouble. Trouble?!You wanna take... You are trouble. Take, uh, you wanna take some money? Thank you, Jew man. We wasn't gonna rob ya, but, but since you make it so easy! Hey! Hey, leave him alone! Hey! Will you go in the house?! We don't want trouble, please, leave us be! Don't tell me what to do!No, hey, leave us alone! Oh! Now, don't tell me what to do, man! Yudi! There's the cops! Go on man, go! You bastards! Go, go! Drop it! There they go! Go! Hey! What are you doing? See ya later, fool! No! The boy! He is the victim here! Did you see what they did? He needs an ambulance! He's bleeding! Hold on, Sir! We're getting an ambulance. Please! He needs help! Racial violence broke out on the streets of Crown Heights this evening, when a crowd reacted to two black children being hit by a car that was driven by a Jewish man. The car was part of a caravan escorting the leader of the... He's with the doctor now, Mom. They say he lost, he's lost a lot of blood, but... ...returning from a prayer vigil at the gravesite of his ancestors. I'll call you as soon as I know anything. I will. When ambulances arrived, black witnesses alleged that the man who drove the car was taken for treatment by a private Jewish ambulance ahead of the children, one of whom has since died. City officials denied any preferential treatment. The other child was taken to Kings County Hospital and remains in serious condition. At this moment, the rioting has not stopped. Code Blue! Code Blue! We got a chest wound here! ...have not been stopped by the police. Bottles and rocks have been thrown from rooftops. And even gunshots have been fired. There are reports that at least one young Jewish man has been stabbed to death. They were looking for any excuse to riot. That car crash was an accident, pure and simple. The problem is with these Jews, they get preferential treatment. And the police, they either overreacted. Or not reacting at all. Yo, TJ, you shoulda been there, dog! It was slammin'.Crazy. I'm sick and tired of these people treatin' us like that. For real, followin' us around in their cheap-ass stores and shit. D, they follow you 'cause you look like a thug, man. Yo, man, anybody black looks like a thug to them. They also be sweatin' black folks to sell they houses all the time. Yes. You understand? These people, they try to take over, dog.That's right. So last night I had to go get me some Jew shit. Ooh... Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold up, you went lootin'? Word up, man! It was heil Hitler all in that. I ain't about to get locked up over some cheap-ass shit, man. Whoa, whoa, you scared?For real. I ain't scared.Yo, nigga, are you scared? I ain't scared. Well, yo ass shoulda been there then. Moshe! I'm okay, Baruch Hashem, I'm okay. Oh, no, you're not, look at you. It's crazy out there. There's a noise, Chava was up all night crying. It's horrible. Did you see what they did? Look at the windows. It's okay, it can be fixed. Yeah, how we gonna pay for it, hm? Don't worry. Don't worry, only a fool wouldn't worry. Okay, be calm, Rivka. It's over, it's over. It's over, what makes you so sure it's over, hm? Ah, oh, okay, I'm home. Look at your leg, honey. But what did the doctor say? A couple of-- three days. Two or three days? I'm okay. You're not okay, nothing's okay. More violence on the streets of Crown Heights today as hundreds of angry protesters threw stones and rocks, reacting to the arrest of a black teenager, Lemrick Nelson, who's been accused of killing Yankel Rosenbaum, a Hasidic Jewish man. Mayor Dinkins spoke at an emergency press conference. They got Lemrick. Went to my school, what he doing? They say he stabbed that Jewish man. Baby, I gotta go to the bakery. You're going to Kingston Ave today? Never had a problem before, don't expect to today. Ma, look! That ain't got nothing to do with me. I gotta cake to pick up for your daddy. Cake? Why he's supposed to be comin' home or somethin'? He called, said he finished up. You gonna be wastin' five bucks. Watch your mouth! Don't be so quick to give up on him, hm? Whatever. You want me to bring you back a bagel? Unruly mobs greeted the mayor with jeers... Ma, hold up. And eyewitnesses report that... Come on, I'm sure I ain't lettin' you go out there by yourself. I'll be your bodyguard. So you got my back, is that it? Know you're right. Aight, come on... Mr. T. No, the last time Jews were passive, we had the Holocaust! Oh, get real, this is not Nazi Germany. We should arm ourselves, that's what we should do, Oh, you want more violence? We need healing, not shooting. We have to get to the heart of the problem. Yeah, who's got time for the heart of the problem? Who has time for-- Yudi? How's your father? He's getting better. Good, Baruch Hashem. We have to fight back! Every Jew, a .22! Oh, you get a gun. Go ahead, get a gun. You'll shoot your foot off! He's right! You see? We do have to fight back. Next one to mess with me'll be sorry. Even the boy has more sense than you. David! Shalom.Shalom. Gittel told me you'd be here. You've been asked to come to the Rebbe's. The Rebbe?Why him? Yeah, well, why me? Yeah, we'll talk on the way. Um, all right, we'll finish this later. Yeah, if we're lucky. Hold on, what're you doing? I was goin' to the bakery.What for? Why you think she's goin'? You can't go to the bakery in your own neighborhood? This isour neighborhood, officer. Sure ain't yours. All right, kid, up against the wall, I'm gonna search you. No, he hasn't done anything. Put your hands above your head, please. Look, why you pickin' on him? Let him be! And you, too, turn around and face the wall. Hold up, you're gonna frisk my mom? Face the wall, both of you, with your hands above your heads, please! This is ridiculous. Moms are a real big threat around here, huh? Shut up. All right, you can go. You better watch him. The color you see when you look at me, make you blind to my humanity. So the crime is yours, you see? Come on, Ma, we can get a cake somewhere else. We're not safe anymore. I know, my children... How can we live like this? Shalom. So, Lazerson. Yesterday, Mayor Dinkins asks the Rebbe to help find ways to bring the two communities together. You know what the Rebbe said to him? What two communities? We're one community, under one administration, under one God. Nice if other people felt like that. Precisely, and in that vein, the Rebbe has a job for you. Oh, what does he want me to do? Do what you do. You work with our young people. Bring them together with theiryoung people. Maybe together, they can teach the old. I, I... I don't know if I'm the man for this. Abraham, Jacob, Gideon, a long list of "I'm not the man for the job." I'm not in their league. They had God's help, maybe you will, too. I'll need it. Don't we all? Shalom. Shalom. Thanks. It's outta control, man. Yeah, and what are the police doing? You're kidding? No, I'll be out there, yeah, I'm going, right. Okay. Paul Richards, you must be... Dr. Lazerson. Well, they call me Laz. Yeah, listen, I can't really talk right now. We got some problems out there. And I gotta try to calm these folks down. Well, you mind if I come along? No, you can come. You a Yankee fan? Yeah, you? No. What about the Knicks? No, not really. Not really? Are you kidding? Did you watch last season? That was their best season. You got a problem rooting for New York? Come on. Over here. That van yours? Yeah, I call it the Peace Mobile. Looks like we got one thing in common. What's that? Color. Say what? Red, the dented one's mine. Young people! Don't be part of the problem! Go on home, now! I'm outta here! Get off the street! Why, why, why don't the cops doing anything? You got me, man. David Stein and Simcha Levi go home! Before I call your parents! Be quiet, be seeing you, Jew boy! I never thought I'd see anything like this in my neighborhood. And this is far from over, man. What you wanna do? Hey! Hey, don't! We gotta stop this now. Let's get out. Calm down! Calm down! Hey! No, no! Hey, hey! Hey, hands off!Go home! Go home! Go! Okay, back off! Break it up! Break it up! You! Now you two stop it! Go on home! Let's, get outta here, man! You all right? Yeah, you? Yeah. Oh, how we gonna stop this? We got youth out here with nothing. Frustrated, crazy, angry. Yeah, I got an old woman, committed suicide last night 'cause some kids broke a window yelling "Heil Hitler!" Most of these kids don't even know who Hitler was, man. They couldn't tell you their history, let alone yourhistory. Why don't we, why don't we get 'em, talking to each other? Maybe they can learn somethin', you up for that? That's what I do, man. No, I meant, with me. Aight. Okay. We'll give it a shot.All right. We'll get some boys and girls together... No, no, time out, time out.What? Girls don't fly on my side. Aight. Well... it's the boys make the most of the problem on this. All right. Let's give it a shot. Okay. Get some from your turf, I'll get some from mine. We'll get 'em talking to each other. Should be easy, huh? Yeah. We're having a summit meeting. You know guys, I think we got a great opportunity here. Thursday at 7:00 over at the school, we're gonna get together and talk about the... I don't want it. ...problems that...What's this? 7:00, we're gonna have a summit meeting where everybody gets together. Young man, we'd love to have you at our meeting on Thursday. We're gonna talk about the community where we can get... This is ridiculous, who needs this? And Jesus the Christ tells us, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for it is they that will be called the children of God." Now brothers and sisters, we sit up here every Sunday talking about how we love God, don't we? Don't we? Yes. But you can't love God, while you hate another of his people. And the foulness, man! Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Buggy, yo! Get yo hands... Clean the damn dogs! Don't mess with me, 'cause what you see, it won't be what you G-E-T. The Torah says that a Jew should be the first to greet his neighbor in peace. So basically with... Hey, Yudi! Yu-Yudi! What y'all doin' about it? So we're starting a series of meetings. For Jewish youth to speak with black youth. Public Enemy, upliftin' the race, know what I'm talkin' about? Man, you dissin' Underground's just 'cause they talkin' about chicks and tellin' jokes? Listen, man, what's more important, doin' a Humpty Hump, man, or "Fight the Power"? Man, the Humpty Hump, yo! Hey, young brothers. I'm gonna tell you help spread the peace, we gonna talk together. So you really trying to get us to talk to some Jews, huh? Yeah, man, why should we? We have to fix this mess. You know we got to live together. Blow it out, man, that's just noise. How you doin', TJ? I'm aight. Your dad been around? It's no big thing, ya know? No, it's a big thing, man. Your dad's stuff, that's no reflection on you, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. All right. Love to see ya at this meeting, man. Take it easy, TJ. I'm not interested, sorry. The, the meetings are, are supervised, and we're making sure that it's safe for everyone there. Look, I don't care. Listen to what he has to say. Ta, after what happened to you-- Look, I, I know this is tough for you. And, and for both of you. You, you were attacked, this is personal, but-- No, no, it's not just about us. What about the ones who loot and start fires? What about the guy who killed Yankel Rosenbaum? You're gonna condemn an entire people for the ruthless acts of a few? Is that what you're gonna do? I don't-- I don't know. Well, come to a meeting and you'll know more. What if the guys who attacked us are there? Then we'll have them arrested. I hope to see you there. Thank you, Rivka, Moshe. Laz. I'll let myself out. Thanks, Laz. You don't have to do this. I think it's a good idea. It's a silly idea. Why are you pressuring him? Who's pressuring? I don't want him to hate. I'm not hating anyone. I hate what they do. Look, it's not like when we were in college. There's no more learning to do? Not when it puts our child in danger. I'm not a child.You area child. Okay, I understand there's fear. But we can't let it rule our lives, right, Yudi? I'm not afraid. If that's true, then there's no reason why you shouldn't go to that meeting. Is there? Moshe, what are you talking about? He's gonna get hurt. No, he won't, he'll be fine.He's gonna get hurt. Why you always arguing with me as for what's best for him? We live separate and we want to live this way. And after all, America is about living the way you want to live. We live this way and we aren't harming anyone else. Our children, they spend all day studying the Torah. They don't have time for anything else. I ain't advocating all this comin' together. Healin' America's bullshit! All right?Go ahead. All right, um, well, I'm glad to see more of you showed up this time. Here's what we're gonna do. I want you to listen to a few minutes of this. And then I want you to tell me what the theme is and who you think the singer is. That has got to be Vanilla Ice, man! It's not Vanilla Ice. Yeah, that's too much credit, man. That's gotta be one of them Beastie Boys, 'cause... Unh-unh. Definitely a white though, right? Well, you got-- yeah, you got some of that right. It's, uh, it's me. You? I actually recorded this a couple of months ago. I was fed up with all the, uh, racial hatred going on. You know, Bensonhurst, Howard Beach. The point here is that, uh, we have more in common with each other than some of us think we do. Look, what we're doing here, what we wanna do is get everybody talking. Get to understand each other a little bit. So we're gonna have open dialogue. It's a free forum. You can say whatever you want, no holds barred. Just ask any question you want and get to know each other. Okay? So if you wanna ask these guys a question... go ahead. One of y'all wanna ask one of these Hasidic gentlemen a question? Open it up. Nothing, nothing's too private to ask, just kick it out. Aight, why ya'll be wearing those beanies? Ooh, serious issue, man, good one. They're called yarmulkes. Why do you wear 'em? To honor "Hashem."Who? The name, what you'd call God. Why don't you got those curls like the Jews in Williamsburg? They still look like undertakers. What about those string things hanging out your clothes? They're called tzitzit. Titties? It says in the Torah-- Hey, whoa, whoa, wait a minute, that is our holy book, go ahead. The four knots remind you that God is in all directions, everywhere. Why do you guys wear your hair like that? Like what? This? Dreads. We grow it, we don't wear it like this. And what, you grow it like that with mud? Mud? What? Some people wear it just for the look. But the Rastafarians in Jamaica started to grow their hair like this as a sign of pride. We are proud of the texture of our hair. And furthermore, it says it in the Bible. In Leviticus, Jah said, "Thou shall not cut off thy hair off thy head." You read Torah? Torah? Hear me, man. We, my people, that is, are the original lost tribe. So how come you guys wear all black? So we don't shoot each other over sneakers and jackets like you do. Little punk, you think that's funny, right? It's true, isn't it? Wait, now, wait, wait, wait, let's see... Can we, can we just see if we can hold off making accusations about each other, okay? You know what, take a second, look at your feet. Look at your shoes, man. You see the, the Jewish kids are all wearing black shoes. And the African-American boys are all wearing sneakers. High tops, at that,Right. So that's, that's what? That's culture, right? They got their uniform, you got your uniform. It doesn't mean one's better than the other. Listen, man, I want to talk about how ya'll get special treatment, that's what I want to talk about, you know what I'm saying? I get hassled all the time 'cause I'm black. Yeah, that's 'cause the cops know that we don't commit the crimes. We're not breaking into homes, we're not stealing car radios. Neither do I. What? Because I'm black, I'm a criminal? Listen, we get hassled by the cops, too. I, I got attacked, and they acted like I was the criminal. What do you know about that, white boy? You ever been pulled off the streets and beaten by cops? Welcome to our neighborhood.That's right, punk. Ay, yo, the real issue here is that some Jew let a little black boy die because they don't think of us as humans! That's bullcrap, man, it's simply not true, come on! It is true! What are you talking about, man? Your ambulance took away that Jewish driver, not the kid! That guy in that ambulance won a medal for rescuing a black kid from a fire just weeks ago. Lettin' that kid die was an attack on all blacks. Nobody killed that boy!It was an accident. Hold up, hold up! We have a choice here, man. Now we can let our neighborhood be a war zone, right? Or we can get to know each other. If we don't get to know each other, we gonna look at each other as aliens, as strangers, as the enemy, understand that? It's a choice. You know what the truth is? The truth is that if you cut any of us open, we all look the same, right? But do we have to do that to know it? You have a choice right here. Yankel Rosenbaum didn't have a choice. They killed him just 'cause he was a Jew. The Jews started it by killing that kid. Yo, man, we could go back and forth all day about what we disagree on. But I got homework to do. What, what, what, that's funny? When I'm-- 'cause I'm black, I can't do homework? Now let me school you, aight? There is some of us that actually do want an education. Word.Okay, okay, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna make a peace mural, across the street from the site of the accident. And we would like you to come help us paint it. And any of ya'll that can stay, don't have to do homework, we'd appreciate it. We'll talk through this and work this stuff out. Okay, I'm gonna say a prayer, man. Go ahead. You know what? Um, before we go, everybody just stand up. Huh?Come on, guys. Come on. Come on, all y'all, stand up. Stand up. There you go. Come on, TJ, stand up, man. What? We gonna sing "We are the World"? Come on. Take the hand of the man next to you. Grab his hand. Ain't gonna bite you. It's not that hard. Come on, guys. May the Lord bless you and keep you. May he lift up his countenance upon you and grant you peace. Amen. Amen. Thank you for coming, okay? All right. Yo, you diggin' this? It's all right. I seen you somewhere. Doubt it. You know the Jewish lady, Mrs. Feinstein? She's a neighbor. She asked me turn off the stereo in her house one weekend. There was this dude there who looked just like you. Yeah, we all look alike. Ya'll dress alike, that's for damn sure. Wasn't me. You know why she asked you to turn off her stereo? She didn't know where the power button was, so I showed her. On shabbos we don't work or operate equipment, so she wouldn't have touched the stereo. Sha what? That's the Sabbath to you. Oh, my bad, I thought she was just slow or somethin'. Oh, you thought she was slow? Yeah. Actually, Mrs. Feinstein is slow. Just look at what these people are doing. They let their children run wild in the streets. There's no parents, no responsibility. There's no wonder they're killing people. The Jew controls the politicians, and the devil has been disseminating, defiling, colonizing, and sucking the blood out of the black community for years. No, I don't hear you bustin' that wack-ass white boy rhyme. What up, dog? Man, you tell me. You the one buyin' this brotherly love bullshit. Tell me what's wrong with people trying to get along, huh? It don't work! Just like that teen summit shit ain't gonna work either, watch. That's right. In the end, people stick with they own. Are you comin'? I'm out, man. Hey, hey, man, watch that! Oh, sorry. Painting's not my strong suit. Yeah, I see that. Heard Al Sharpton's coming to do a rally. I'm gonna check it out. What? How can you? He preaches the opposite of what we're trying to do here. You don't know what he really preaches, Laz. And I gotta know what he's really saying if I'm gonna be dealin' with it. He demonizes us. You think they really believe in this? I think they're hypocrites. Hey. Hey! Homeboy chick! Could you not, could you not do that around me, please? Oh, excuse me, I think it's bad enough that my dad told me to be here. I don't think you're gonna tell me what to do now. Well, why does your father even care? My father hates them. Apparently the Rebbe doesn't agree. Careful with that, schmuck! What? Hey, what'd you call me? Yeah, you heard what I said. Hey. Hey! Unh-unh. Chill out! Just calm down. Why don't y'all chill out? Chill out, right. We got a lot of testosterone flying around here, man. We might need to do somethin' more than paint walls. How about a contact sport? You know what, that's not a bad idea. I was kidding. Y'all not into sports? Well, we have a basketball court at the center. You any good? You never heard of the rebounding Jews? Read your history. 'Sup? Don't wanna get your suit dirty, huh? Not really into hard labor. Yeah, we leave that to you. You think you so much better, huh? Don't wanna be nothin' like us, right? Over there wit your homey over there. He's a closet rap star. Yeah, right. I'm outta here. So what you groovin' to? It's my business. That's what I thought. White boys can't rhyme! You bustin' the Tribe like that? Damn, man. A house is not a home. Yo, those are my boys! I can't believe you listen to 'em! Yeah, I got a bunch of their stuff. That's a trip. Heavy D and Digital Underground? Their shit is phat. For real. Cryptic. So you got any other moves? Ah, yeah! So how'd you even get into the sound? I just started hearing on the radio. Hey... How you gonna learn how to move? "Yo MTV Raps." You're kidding me, right? You watch that? Religiously. Religiously? When I can. I thought ya'll were like the Amish and shit. I thought ya'll didn't even have TVs. Most Hasids don't have televisions, but a few do. And I make it a point to be on good terms with those few. Smart move. No justice! Don't need no justice! You know in the past, the Jews and the black people, they were not enemies. If you look at American history, the Jews were among the first people to fight for the civil rights of black people in America. They lump us all together, but we're not all the same. Some of the loudest protestors out there, they're not even from our community. Good shot. Time out. What up with that? We have a league. I didn't know y'all had sneakers. You know how to freestyle? Dope! You got skills! What skills? Yo, homey can rhyme! He can freestyle, D! For real. So he can copy and steal our culture, that makes him dope, right? Listen, he ain't bothering you, leave him alone. Nigga, give me the ball. What? Let's take 'em, T.Who you smacking? You wanna play dem? Come on, we can beat them. Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on Jew boy, let's see what you got! Yeah! Boy! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right here! Whoo! Whoo! Oh, man, whoo-whoo-whoo! Right here! Right here! Give me that, give me that. Ahh! I see you ain't gonna be on no team. It's aight, Yudi, we'll get 'em! Yo, TJ, ain't that your old man? Yeah, that's your shot. Up and easy. Too easy, man. Give me the ball! Where you been at? You were supposed to be home weeks ago. You, you know I can't never do nothin' on time. It's good to, to see you. Still got your crew, I see. 'Sup fellas? Hey! Wassup?! Never seen you play with one of those guys before. I got it, I got it. Now watch my work.Hey! That's Yudi. We've been havin' these meetings. They've been on the news and everything. Supposed to be havin' this game between the Jews and the blacks. Oh, you guys'll kill 'em. Maybe you could make it. I'd like that. The mayor's supposed to be there. It's gonna be a real big thing! Yeah? You goin' to see Ma now? No, son, not right now. I, I got some business to take care of. You didn't get through the whole rehab thing, did you? Uh, I, I, I'm gonna get back to it. I am. We waited for you. Ma had a cake and everything. You blew us off, man. I didn't mean to, really. Yeah, whatever. So when is that big game? It's no big deal if you can't make it, you know? I'm gonna be there. In fact, let me, let me get the particulars. Now, come on, hit me. It's on the 17th. The 17th. The Jewish school on Eastern Parkway. Aight, I'm gonna check it out. You better play good, boy. "Cause I'm gonna be watchin'. Come on, give me some. Hey, what happened? Pops break out again? Stuff it! Hey, don't be a pussy! TJ. Where you goin'? Hey, wait up. What?! You all right? Listen, why shouldn't I be? Is your dad okay? I don't wanna talk about it, leave it alone, all right? My dad's gain' through a rough time, too. Wassup with your dad? I don't want to talk about it. You brought it up. We've been using food stamps. I thought ya'll all had money hidden away. I thought you lived in a watermelon. I hate it, though. I can tell it makes him feel small. Plenty of folks I know doin' the same thing. Forget it. I know what you're talkin' about. Life does that shit, you know? Sometimes it can beat you down, know what I'm sayin'? Right. So those guys, you rap with them? Yeah, freestylin' mostly. Maybe you and me could put something together? Me and you? Yeah. Maybe. If half the money spent on police overtime went to youth programs, the whole thing might never have happened. Okay, you gotta hear this. Just listen, just listen. I wrote this, and I want to play it at the mural dedication. Right, and the kids are really into this. They want to do the whole hip-hop thing. Well, have the council call me back, please, thank you. What kids? What are you, what are you talking about? Slow down, man. What? You, you don't like the song? I don't like rushing into things. Laz, we're gonna do this kind of thing, we gotta do it together, you understand? You're absolutely right. You, you know some players? That's not what I meant. You don't like the idea? What? The lyrics? You don't like the lyrics? You need a real bass player. Yeah, right. You know one? You're lookin' at one. Get out! Huh. Destiny! God works in mysterious ways. You're tellin' me. You know about this? You saw the boy he brought home? Is there a problem?Is there? Laz has it under control. I think Laz should just stay out of other people's business. Rivka, I'm pleased. I see Yudi changing. Change? Hello? What's so good about change? Ay. Five, six, seven, eight. And one, two, three, and four. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three... Oh, you just did one thing off, it was that last kick. Do the kick, and it's-- Then, after doing that one, do this thing. Then around, boom-boom, brent. I'll get the tape working. Yo, um, you should come to this underground dance club I go to. Cheer up with me, have some fun. Ah, I can't do that kinda stuff. Why? I'm lucky my parents are letting me do this. You don't tell 'em, Yudi, duh. I don't even have free time, okay?Just forget it. If I'm not studying for school, then I study Torah. I think you might want to reconsider. They got these fly-ass honeys there. Girls? All types, trust me. Okay, okay, look, enough talk. We're doin' the dance now. Okay, whatever, whatever you say. Wait, I'm gonna turn the bass up? Come on. All right? Five, six, seven... Okay, Chaim, here's your music. Thank you for coming, sir. Ed. Thanks. Paul. You know what, I want to try this. Let's give it a try. Ready? One, two, one-two-three-four. Oi, yi, yi. You sound like a canter. You better watch it, man. No, no, I'm kidding, you were terrific, it's great. I have a little change of heart, though. I want to hear "Increase the Peace." Show me what you got to this tape, okay? Hey, that's cool, that's cool. Oh, no, Gittel, Gittel, not now, girls. I'm still rehearsing, it's not ready yet. I'll call you when it's ready. It's the wife and kids. You know what? Let's go with "Increase the Peace." It works, hm? This interracial community effort is called Project Cure. Cure stands for communication, understanding, respect, and education. What's up, ya'll? This is Dr. Laz, representin' Project Cure. Number 613 coming outta of Crown Heights, Brooklyn! We're all here for one reason, to promote peace and unity. Come on, come on! Come on, Chaim! Play that clarinet! Franco! Stand as one! Here we go! What are you doing? Listen, they laughing at us! So what? Are you quitting? I didn't come out here to be made no fool. Only jerks are laughing. Those jerks are my friends. Well, everyone else likes us, okay? They came here to check us out, and they're into it. Don't blow this off. I don't know, man. I feel embarrassed. Come on. An interracial rap group made its debut this afternoon on the streets of Crown Heights, a community recently ravaged by rioting. The group helped dedicate a peace mural that was created by neighborhood residents both African American and Hasidic. Yo, man, we famous! We're a real group. You guys sounded great. We're gonna need more songs. I'm workin' on it. Why don't you let us help with that? Yeah, I'm down for that. Hey, that's a good idea, man. He could use all the help that we could give. Hey! So... now that me and Yudi are rap stars, wanna be our groupies? TJ? Ah, Hindy and Devorah, do you mind taking the glasses into the kitchen for me, please? Yudi, man, Curly is fine! Why don't you try to rap to her? TJ! What's up with you, man? What?Listen, TJ, you can't act like that in a Hasidic home. Like what? I can't rap to Devorah. You shouldn't either. Wait, you can't flirt? Can you even date? No. Yo, that's wack! Shut up, TJ. Look, I ain't tryin' to diss you, I'm just sayin', don't you even think about chicks? Don't you want to hang out with them? Of course.Yeah, I would go crazy if I couldn't talk to no honeys. I know you would, but you don't understand our culture, aight? Do you like that part of your culture? Screw you, schmuck!Look, look, I ain't tryin' to diss you, I'm just tryin' to get where you're comin' from, hm? It's my least favorite part. Satisfied? Listen, man, I'm goin' to this dance club I told you about. You should come, check it out. It's time to celebrate, man! Yeah, man! You gonna hang out or what? I gotta study. Aight, man, two fingers. You don't know what you're missin', boy chick! What's happening in America is that many Jews are abandoning their traditions, their beliefs. By assimilation, we are disappearing. We've been robbed of everything. Brought over here on slave ships. We lost our names, our culture. We've become no one and that's exactly how we're treated. Whatcha doin' here? Hey, son. I'm lookin' forward to that game thing. What time did you get in? Why you lettin' him stay here? This is still his home. That's wack! Is it so hard to understand? I love your daddy. He's trying to get it together. He is so excited about what you're doin'. Together we're better. Tougher than leather. Very good. Got you a kosher soda, man. Thanks. Taste's the same, I just don't get it. Yeah, a lot of people don't. Yeah, people can get real narrow. Know what I mean? Yeah, they can. You try to do something positive, they're just gonna come down on you, right? Yeah, I love my mom and all. But she just don't get how hard it is out there. Yeah? Well, I have two of them. Always fighting. You know, and... We can't fart without having an argument. Parents still do it? Every Saturday. I thought that was a holy day for y'all. It is, doing it on shabbos is a double mitzvah. Yeah, man, it make me so mad at my mom, 'cause she's still doin' it with my dad. Just can't wait to get my own place. You? I don't know. What? You're afraid to be out on your own? Did the mayor send any type of words? Yes, that he would have liked to have been here... I thought Jewish schools were supposed to be rich or somethin'.Basil, that's rude. I'm really glad somebody from the mayor's office came today. It really makes a difference. Lazerson! Lazerson! Anything, anything happens to my kid, I'm holding you responsible. Don't worry, he'll be fine. No, you put our boys together with them, and first it's games, then what, drugs? You know what kind of people these schvartzescan be. Yeah, I know what kind of people they can be. They can be Sidney Poitier, Michael Jordan, Dr. Martin Luther, you know, you're talking lashon hara, the sin of killing a person by spreading rumor. You're telling me these people didn't start the violence? That-that, they-they, they-they, they don't, they don't fight? That, why are you playing them against us? We're not, we're not, we're not playing, it's a mixed team. It's not one group against another. What, what are you talking about? I'm not talking-- I'm talking about violence. Ta! It'll be fine, we wannaplay. Hey, great team... Wait up, man, y'all walking too fast. Yudi, don't get hurt. You enjoy.All right. Come, let's find some seats. Is that seat available? Okay, boys, let's circle up. All right, fellas, form up. Right on the line. Here we go. Are you ready? Let's do it? Good game. Let's give 'em a good show. We'd like to thank the Yeshiva for hosting us. We'd like to thank God and the Rebbe for his wisdom. But most of all, we want to thank each and every one of you for comin' out and supporting this vital work. We truly are one community under one administration under one God. Play ball! We got contact right here! Two shot, two shot! All right, let's do this thing today. Come on, man, the pass. Let's do this! How you doin'? Just hold that! Oh! That's okay, TJ!Come on, TJ! Yes. Come on. Come on. Good shot, baby! Knee up, knee up! I gotta go. Pick it up! TJ, pick it up, come on! Ooh! Ladies and gentlemen, we are Laz, and the Cure! Hit it! Go, go, go, go... That's enough, TJ. Peace, everyone! Peace! Yo! TJ, we just can't roll out there doin' whatever we feel. We gotta show some respect, right? TJ? Look, man, the Hasidic community is a very conservative one, brother. Listen, I ain't Jewish. And I ain't playin', man. Now look, you gotta learn to show some respect, young brother. You know, you just gotta understand that we... Nah, no, no, ain't nothin' wrong with dancin' with a chick. It might not be your culture, but it damn sure is mine! TJ. TJ! Paul, just-- What? What? Take it easy, let's just... Take it easy? Give him a minute, let him calm down. This kid needs some discipline, Laz. Is that your role?Let me tell you somethin'. This kid needs guidance now. Later is too late. If he doesn't learn to respect himself and respect other people, he's not gonna make it. And I bet if that were Yudi acting out, you wouldn't take it easy on him, man. Excuse me, excuse me, gentlemen? I'm the principal of a Bronx elementary school. And I would really love it if your group would play for the kids. Me, too. Sharon Kane, Director of the Hebrew Seniors Home in Yonkers. Seniors want our music? Mm-hmm. It's really what I've been looking for. You know, it just keeps them feeling young, Yo! Yo! There's a dude out here waitin' on ya'll. Says he books half-time acts during basketball season at the Garden! The Garden? As in, as in Madison Square? Exactly. Oh, ohh... Hey, TJ. What? We, we were really awesome, I-- You, you were really good out there, okay? Look, it just seemed like all they were doing was coming down on you, but they should've told you we did a really good job. Yeah, whatever, man. Where you going? Clubbin'. Now? Why not? You want some company? Yeah. Come on. Man, they got the game! Man, we ain't come here to watch no game, come on. Hey, Mama, what's up? I'm sayin', let's dance, let's get poppin'. Hey, cutie, let's dance. I don't know. Come on, I want to dance. I'm not sure. Yo, dance man. Come on, you're gonna embarrass me. Dance! Hey, yo! I bet your cave boy wish he were a baller! Maybe D, but no, he ain't getting' it, not tonight. Yeah! Come here, Ma. Nice eyes, call me. Got them digits, huh? You think you the man now, don't you? Wait, wait, what are you doin'? Leave me alone. Dag! You could at least keep her number for a souvenir! You don't get it, do you? I'm not even supposed to touch a girl, all right? Stop trying to make me do stuff I don't wanna do. "Stop tryin' to make me do stuff I don't wanna do." You sound like a little bitch! Oh, do I?What's your problem, man? You're my problem! You think I wanna be like you, but I don't! Oh, yeah, so leave hip-hop alone then. That's me, that's my culture. Oh, it's your culture? Guess what, buddy, you don't have any culture. How the hell would you know, you kosher-eatin', non-datin', blue-balled motherfucker! Least my father's not a crack head! Nah, he's Section 8 and that ain't nothin' to brag about! You beanie-wearin' bee-aach! All right, now you take that back to Mama's. Good job. You're late. I know, I'm sorry. Where's TJ?I don't know. Better not be messin' up, man. Throwin' the whole game off. Wassup? Nothin'. TJ, are you runnin' on CP time? I'm here, man. 'Cause the ball team's gettin' tight. I don't want us fallin' behind. You choose who's playing? I got my top 10. We on it? No. What's with that? You got somethin' against my play? You both already have enough to do. Yo, Noah? Whatta you want? Vat I want, you did such a nice job building the ark, I thought if you had some time, maybe you can build me a nice table, a cabinet. Oi vey! No, I vant... I vant to sing a song! Fine. Huh? Here we go! I can't understand a word they're saying. What is he saying? Would you please, shut up?! I was listening to that. Hey, shove that away! Hey, what the hell you doing?! Hey, hey! Relax, man, you guys act like babies. What's wrong with you? Wanna fight? Let 'em fight. Let 'em take it outside. Wanna take it outside? Laz. Yeah, let's take it outside. Fine. Let's go!Aight, come on! That's what I thought. Hey! Where the hell are you goin'?! Hey, wait up! Hey, come back! Stop! Where ya'll goin'?Stop! Stop! What's up? Were you actually gonna leave us? Who's the bad guy now, huh? Now, if I had left you, you'd have to figure out a way to get home together, wouldn't you? So if we're gonna make it to the Garden, we gotta do it as a team. Unless you guys don't want to do this anymore. Seen this? Muslim paper calling Judaism a gutter religion and Hitler a hero to his people. Yeah, I seen it. Yeah? So how come the leaders in your community don't speak out against this racism? What'd you know what the leadersin our community speak out against, Laz? You listen to them? No, I read, and let me tell you somethin'. If the Jews trashed a neighborhood, we'd speak out. Really? Mm-hmm. Do you speak out against the Israeli treatment of the Palestinian people? Some of us do. Enough to stop it? You cannot compare Israel to this. Israel's the only free country in a region that is dominated by dictatorships. I'm talking about irresponsible leadership here. Yeah? Well, that works both ways. A lot of what's in that paper is shit, but some of it is empowering. Arab terrorists? You cannot legitimize this bullshit. Ah, anger feels good, doesn't it? When you've been slaves for centuries, sometimes you lash out, man. We were slaves once, too. Why condemn and vilify us? Laz, you can not possibly compare the situation of blacks and Jews in America today, man. Oh. You think anti-Semitism is ancient history? Well, think again, buddy. But it is not the cornerstone of the system, the way racism is. Anti-Semitism is racism! Man, look at the courts! Who, who's in jail? Who's got the jobs?Oh, I don't, I don't... Who got the money? Oh! 12% of America is black and we control less than one half of 1% of America's wealth, man. You know, I don't want to hear, all the different-- You guys, you guys are late. You know, you gotta, you, you gotta shape up. If you don't have your stuff together, we're not gonna be ready to play the Garden. If this comes through, we gotta be tight. Listen, man, we thought this over. It's gonna be dope. First the Garden, then we get a record deal. We're about to be paid. You work hard, who knows? Oh, wait, when ya'll ain't trippin' though. You know we're not Run-D.M.C., right? Yo, man, it's gonna blow up, I'm tellin' you. Fellas, we're lucky people come hear us at all. What is that? Laz, come on, man, how good are we really? We're good. For real, man. If not, why are we getting all these dates? Yeah? We fill a need. Folks know somethin' could jump off at any time. They like seeing that we can work together. But that doesn't mean we're gonna end up on some big-ass world tour. No, no, we gotta practice to get there. We're here, we're practicing. Watch. We've been working on something. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. Whoa, hey, that's good. All right, so you guys continue arguing, and we'll practice another one. You know what your man, Elijah Mohammad said. Oh, no, no, no, no. You're not gonna quote Muslim to me. Teach the young ones and the old ones will follow outta curiosity or shame. You know what, why don't we just agree to disagree? Agreed. Man, I'm representin'. Aight, these ain't their streets. This is ourstreets. I guess, man. I don't know.What? You guess? Whatcha'll doin'? Puttin' some hoops up in the hood, man, tryin' to give you young brothers somethin' to do. Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you people doin' here? Everything we're doin' has been approved by the city council, Joel. You got a complaint, call their office. Yeah, I have a complaint. I have a complaint. He's just mad 'cause he think the hoop gonna attract the wrong kinda persuasion. Maybe he's afraid of his window getting cracked. He's probably just afraid customers might get hit by a ball. Ah, I'm steppin' this corner, man. Thanks, Darren. Yeah. Why don't you stick around and give us a hand? Aight. Okay, boys, Shabbos calls, come on. Yeah, we outta here. Hey, hey, whoa, no, no. They can't work anymore, but I got ya'll for another hour. What? And Darren, you gonna stick around, make yourself a little bit more helpful, man. Come on. Paul, can you do me a favor? Sure. Wanna take the Torah mobile back for me when you're done? Yeah. It's too late for me to drive. No problem. Okay, buddy. Grab the ladder, brother, grab the ladder. Ai ai, ai! Ai, ay! Just do it.I got it. Looks like ya'll might be doin' some good in the hood. 'Bout time that you see it. We're trying. What the hell is that? Aw, man, what happened here?! Man! What'd they do to the mural? Now who would wanna do this, man? Them, man!What them? Man, they hate us! They don't even want our face on the same wall as them. And that's who you've been hanging out with. We don't know who did it, Darren, so don't say nothin'. Come on, let's go. It's cold, man. Let's go! Look at this! Look what they did to the mural. Come on guys, get in. Where they going? Hey, those guys are stealing Lazerson's van! What? First you spray-paint the mural and now you steal a car! What's your problem? Calm down. Back off! The controversial case of Lemrick NelsonShh, come on. was finally settled in court today. Hold still. He was released from jail despite objection from the Jewish community. A jury earlier this year found him guilty of the murder of Yankel Rosenbaum. A man was murdered, lynched, for one reason only, because he was a Jew. And now the system has let that murderer go free. Dey all upset and yellin' about who did what to who. But how ya'll ever gonna know the truth? Hey, you all right? I'm gonna live. I thought this was all about making peace. Yeah, well... Sometime we're gonna have setbacks. Yeah. Hey, TJ, look. I don't blame you for being upset. I'm fine, just don't wait for me at rehearsal Sunday, 'cause I'm not comin'. Why not? Man, I'm through with this bullshit! TJ! Hey... You're not gonna let one fight make you quit, are you? It ain't just that. You never stop preachin'! You never gave me a chance! You always give me a hard time in front of everyone! I'm sorry. TJ, you know I'm tryin' to help you, not hurt you. I'm truly sorry. You want to take it out on me, you take it out on me. There's no need to take it out on them. You know what, just forget it. Forget them and forget it all! Hey, TJ! People been disappointin' you all your life. You gonna let that make you bitter? It doesn't matter, I'm movin' on. Where you gonna move on to? It doesn't matter!It all matters! All of it, TJ. You keep your heart open, young brother. Paul? It's official! Yeah, we're gonna play at a Knicks game for real. Yeah, they want the team to play halftime, and then we get to perform, too. Yeah, movin' on up. Want somethin' to drink? Gittel! Laz, Laz, Laz... TJ wants out. Out? Why? He's had enough, man. His heart ain't in it. This is not good. Maybe he needs time just to cool down. Well, then that gives you three weeks to change his mind. Well, I'm not sure that's gonna happen, Laz. Oh, so you've given up on him then? No, I'm being realistic, man. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, have you talked to him since after the fight? No. You wanna dance alone? Alone? Alone. Hi, Yudi. Hi. Nice to see you. It's been a while. Come on in. Yeah? Hey. Hey. What's up with you? Why'd you, why'd you skip rehearsal, what's with that? Listen, I'm not feelin' that cure stuff no more. It's not workin'. Oh, it's not workin'. That's why we got the Garden, right? What? Yeah. Us. Doing our song at a Knicks game at Madison Square Garden. Man, our song is wack. Ain't no real peace out here. Ask your friend! Okay, okay, we aren't all brothers, but, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't keep working at it, right? Maybe... know what? I just don't even know anymore. At least they let Lemrick go. They let him go? You-- you're talking about the guy who killed Yankel? Yeah. That's crazy, I can't believe they let that son of a bitch off! They can't prove it was him. He was, like, one of 10 brothers there that night. Especially when we all look alike to you people. You know what? Actually it was 20 of your brothers standing there, all of them just watching as an innocent man got killed. The guy who killed little Gavin, he didn't pay, did he? That, that's different from deliberately killing someone, you know it! Know what? It was murder! You say don't make you right! You're blind sometimes, you know that? And you're full of it most of the time! So why don't you just get outta my face! What are we doin'? Thing is, we ain't never gonna see things the same way. Word up. You know... you're right. The Garden. It is all wack, who needs any of this? I don't know. Moshe? Laz. Where is he? Upstairs. Come in. How ya doin'? I'm fine. You know, the, uh, Talmud talks about good deeds having a rippling effect. I did my part. I'm trying to get back to being a good Jew now. What are you talking about? You were being a good Jew. You're doing mitzvahs, you're doing good work. No, singing and dancing? They're not mitzvahs, I'm done. If there's a rippling effect, good, then you don't need me anymore. Well, actually we do. We have a chance to do something big here. Don't throw it away. I've got Torah to learn. Your routines are so hot, you know? Let him be, Laz, he's done enough. Is that true? Don't we have to keep working at tikkun? Repairing the world. We try, we fail, we try again. The Torah... the Torah speaks about making peace, shalom. That's supposed to be what we're doing here. Now I know that's tough. But do, do you wanna, you wanna give that up? You think TJ will go along with this? Yeah, I'll hold. They're gonna do it. Huh? Who? TJ and Yudi. Both of them? Both of 'em! Man, you a miracle worker! No, it's the kids, man, they're workin' it out. I got the Garden on the line. Oh! Back on. Yeah, sure. No, it'll be good. It'll be great! Ha-ha. Okay. We got a, we got a problem. What? They don't want the band. Wha, why-- what you, what, what, what, what are you saying? Well, they only want the basketball team. Ah... What, what do you mean? What do you mean? Well, it's their show, they can do what they want. No! No-no-no-no-no-no-no, this is a package deal here. They get the team and the band. But they're saying they don't have time for both. Damn! Well, call 'em back. Call them back! It's not gonna make a difference, man. It's not gonna make a difference? That it doesn't-- this is wrong! I, I want this! I want, I want this, I want this for, for Yudi and TJ. This is such a great opportunity here. Laz. Are you sure you want it for them? What, what are you trying to say? What you want for you and what's really, really right for those boys might not be the same thing. That's the bitch about raising kids, man, am I right? It's not about me. Don't, don't start dumpin' on me here. Laz, curb the ego, I'm not doin' that. Oh, oh, and like, like you don't want to change the world? Yes, but you gotta recognize the limits. No, you go beyond the limits! It's just all these little steps never... seem to be good enough to you. Laz, you gotta stop, man, and appreciate where we are now. What we have done. We got people talkin'! Hey... Peace is a long-term investment, brother. Where do you get yourpatience? Years and years of messin' up. All right, fellas, let's go! Come on! Get out here! Let's go! That's it! Gonna be good. Come on, let's do this. Let's do this. All right! Let me hear it! Yeah! Let me hear it again! Yeah! Coming up after the news, the Knicks take on the Pacers at Madison Square Garden. Up next, a federal judge declares a mistrial in... You all right? Fine. I was thinkin' of maybe goin' to the Garden and see... Sure, yeah, it's a good idea. Thought maybe... It's stupid. Forget it, the game's half over. Yudi. You know, you don't have to be a tough guy. Thanks, Ta, but... I can-- I'll figure it out for myself. You grow up, you make choices. You choose one road, you lose another. Ladies and gentlemen, our city has been going through some tough times. But we have come through together. New York is a melting pot of cultures. And tonight, after the tragedies of Brooklyn, we have proof that we can be good neighbors and make our city better. Please give a warm greeting to Crown Heights' own youth group, Project Cure! Let's go! It's great to have these kids here at the Garden. Absolutely! It's taken a while for us to heal... What'd you do that for? 'Cause it was shit. That ain't the way. Could you look at me, please? I know you're hurtin'. I'm sorry, Ma. Come over here and show me. Why don't we watch it together? It's really good to see these young people out here on the floor. Fine athletes representing...
