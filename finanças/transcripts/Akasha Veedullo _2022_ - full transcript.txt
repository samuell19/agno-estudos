Siddhu! No matter how many times this happens, you must move on... But you must not give up. Please dude, try to understand. This is life... live it as you like... do whatever you like. But you must come out of it. [hailing Siddhu] [hailing 'Rock star'] [hailing continues] AAKASA VEEDULLO Siddhu! Siddhu! Siddhu! With the release of his musical album 'Aakasa Veedullo'... Siddhu, who drove his fans crazy a few years ago... why is he away from music and his fans? What is he doing now? Today's special story, on Siddhu the 'Rock Star'. Siddhu is going to do a show for the first time after four years. We will plan for the biggest event ever in the city... Siddhu is performing after almost four years. The youth would go crazy! This is a prestigious event for GK musical company as well. I invite you to cover the event. That's it! [out of network coverage area] [mobile ringing] [busy notification] Damn! This guy is crazy. Hey! Send me that file. [mobile ringing] Sir! Please tell me. Ananth! Where is your buddy? You said he is damn good. He's not even taking my calls, what's wrong? He is not answering GK's calls! He has lost it. -Trusting him, I organized this event. -Sir, I'll speak to him. -Let me talk to him. -Do whatever, just tell him to call me. [mobile ringing] [mobile ringing] Yes, tell me, bro. -Hello, Siddhu. Where are you? -In Goa. Goa? They said it's a dry day... I tried in our city, but couldn't find alcohol... so I drove off to Goa. Your show is in the evening, but you say you're in Goa? I somehow convinced my uncle that you're talented and arranged for this show. Almost after two years you got this opportunity... but you ruined the opportunity. No need to panic, when is the show? Damn it! Don't you know when the show is? Argh! Just tell me at what time is the show? Today at 7:30 PM. [vehicle honks] Will be on the stage by 7:29 PM. Hang up! [collision] Hey! Parked in the middle of the road, have you lost it? -Bro, are you Telugu? -Yes, bro. -Where's your helmet, bro? -Bro, wait. -What's wrong with you, man? -Triple riding moreover? Why hitting me bro, wait? Why are you so mad at me? Remember what I say now, all your life. No matter what... you can't see your ass, and nor your mistake... Understood?

They'll mock you when you're in grief" "If you are in rage, they will back down" "Notice it, notice them fool you" "The world you live in, will backstab you" "How many days would you live in fear?"

Can any engineering student, earn as much? One needs to be talented, bro... -Learn from me. -Oh, is it! Hey, calm down guys. Siddhu, good news for you, bro... CEO of GK music has given you an appointment at 10 AM tomorrow... his manager has messaged me just now... if you are okay with this deal, your life is set. Did I ask for his appointment? Who asked you to? I ran behind his manager for two months... sent him a 30-second trailer of your song, only then we got his appointment. Are you kidding me? Did I tell you to? Why did you send it to him? You took this decision, why are you dragging me? Now, you and sing. Didn't you see, people went crazy in today's show. What more does he need? He is a Rock Star! Once upon a time, he was. Back then things were set and the going was good, but he ruined it all. Shows, events, albums... now nothing. You guys must be blamed. What wrong did we do? Life is not just getting tripped all day long and time pass. We must do something resourceful, else time just flies by. Every day, you just sit in your room and apply music right? Do the same in the studio tomorrow, that's it. Shows, events, albums... now nothing. For a dream to come true, one must work hard for it, right? [sobbing] [college bell ringing] [voices muted] Siddhu! [man snoring] Hey! Show me your paper, man. You! -Hey! Show me your paper, man. -Get lost. -I'll buy you a bottle of liquor. -No way. Please! [inaudible] Students, time's up. Last 15 minutes. -Siddhu! -What? My dad's friend's daughter is coming from Pune... -Let's pick her up. -No way man. My dad will kill me if I don't pick her up. Bablu... let's go. Please bro, waste of money if I book a cab. Okay, let's go. [railway announcement] -Will be back in two minutes. -Okay. [railway announcement continues] Hi, Nisha! Hey, hi! Where to? -Where to? -Hmm! Follow this map. Okay. -Hi! -Hey, hi! How are you? Hey, what are you doing here? Dude, that chick is looking at me. What the hell are you guys doing here man? -Where's Hari? -He got sloshed. So, I came at the right time, come along, let's party. Bro, exams are over, let's get sloshed, that's it. However we would fail the exams, so why party? [crowd cheering] Hey! Hi! I only know Sajiv in your group here. Hi, I am Bulb! Sorry, it's Bablu. -Hi, Bablu! -Shut up man. -Anand here. -Hi! -Excuse me, I'll be back in five. -Okay. Sorry! I forgot to ask your name. Siddharth! Siddharth Krishna! SIddhu! SIddhu! Nice! Come, let's dance. I can booze but can't sway. SIddhu... Why don't you come? [both] SIddhu... Why don't you go? [both] Go, dude. So, what do you do? B. Tech final year. St. Mary's. Oh! You're 22? Do you have smokes? -What? -You have a cigarette? -In the car. -Haan? In my car. Shall we go? -Let's go. -Yeah, sure. You know, what? I am 25. -So? -Just, saying. Do you smoke? I mean, I never tried. Here... there is always a first time. Try it. You'll fly high. Hey! Here, right here. Bye! Hmm! So-- So, when would we meet again? Let's see, I will be here for three more months. Bye! Siddhu! Rather than doing it boringly in the car... romantically let's do it some where outside, next time. -Bye! -Bye! "A little light..." "has shined last night" "This new feeling of love..." "Is chasing me" "As your breath touched me..." "it created a turmoil in my heart" "The stars in the sky..." "are amazed by you" "Oh my God! Like a wave" "Oh my God! I reached out for you" "Oh my God! I fell for you" "Oh my God! I just fell for you in a jiffy" [voices muted] Guys, I got the Visa. "You awakened me from a deep state of trance..." "with your love and charm" "Let the eyes meet my dream" "Let them feel the moment" "As your breath touched me..." "it created a turmoil in my heart" "With the touch of your lips..." "me heart started to pound like never before" "Oh my God! Like a wave" "Oh my God! I reached out for you" "Oh my God! I fell for you" "Oh my God! I just fell for you in a jiffy" "A little light has shined last night" "This new feeling of love is chasing me" "A little light has shined last night" "This new feeling of love is chasing me" "Oh my God! Like a wave" "Oh my God! I reached out for you" "Oh my God! I fell for you" "Oh my God! I just fell for you in a jiffy" Listen to me SIddhu... To prosper in life, being talented is not the only criterion... you'll need support from people like me. "My anaconda don! My anaconda don!" Come up with such a mass number... understood? Aah! Sunny Leone! Once, I must do it with her. Why are you so shocked? Man! I meant I would do a song with her and nothing else. I would never loose a chance if she lets me do something else. But, just imagine... me and Sunny... A perfect combination! Mmwah! Sir, this song is a fusion... a fusion between an intense pain and emotion. Sir, every inch of my body... mind and soul... this song is the result, sir. How can you ask me to do an item song, leaving this song? Sir, art must take shape from within the heart... but not from the lusty eyes. What man, why are you talking too much? Hmm? What are you, man? Trying to preach to me? After all, you begging on the streets without any opportunities. Hmm? Thousands of people like you, roam around my office seeking a single chance. Within a second... I can ruin your career within a second. Hey! Now I am telling you. Not just here, you won't get a chance anywhere else. You'll loose it even if you get one. Instead, come and fall on my feet... then I'll think. Hey! Hey, if you think you can talk all that you want, someday... a guy like me would cut your tongue... and your masculinity. Did I ever beg for a chance? Did I? Careful bro, you might cut it. I'll kill you, you son of a-- -Hey! -Back off, man. Hold him. Hold him right there. I'll see your end. Go get him. -Hey! -Somebody, stop him. What's wrong with you man? Picking up fights where ever you go? What's wrong with whatever he said? What are you? Tell me what are you, in front of him? Dude, people would care only if you are in a certain position... they give a damn about your talent. Whom would you listen to? Why should I? I won't listen to any. Tell him, tell him that Siddhu won't listen to anyone. What the hell was he talking? He is making a living through music, yet he disrespects it. You are comparing me with him? He disrespects the art which earns him bread, are you comparing me with him? -Not that, Siddhu. -Hey, I love music like crazy. It's something beyond for me. If music is an ocean, I want to swim in it forever. I can't feel any pain, while I am with music. He won't understand this, and neither would you. -Hey! -He is dead today. I am going to kill him today. [both] Stop. Why is he so violent? Hey you, open the door. [music mutes voice] [music continues to mute voice] I've never heard such cuss words in my life. Instead of staring at me, do something you idiot. Get the door opened. -He locked it, sir. -He locked it? -I am not able to open it, sir. -Open it somehow... Call his friend, you have his number, right? Call him, call him, man. Did he answer the call? [music mutes voice] What's wrong with him, man? -Yes, brother. -One case beers please. -Chotu! -Yes, bro. -Bring one case beers. -Okay, bro. Bro, here we go. What do you think you are doing, man? Listen man, stop it, else I'll break this bottle on your head. [door bell rings] Make way, boys! -Go and check, who is it. -What's wrong with that fellow? Move, man. Who is it? Siddhu! Siddhu, I am talking to you. Siddhu! Siddhu! Please stop. Punish us if you are mad at us. Why are you hurting yourself instead? Siddhu! Siddhu! Mom is here to see you. She is waiting in the car. -Sandhya! -Yes. -Where are my R&amp;B files? -They are there, look properly. [thunder rumbling] My signature? Enough. Didn't you get your pre-final results? Not yet father, lecturer has some heart issues, itseems. What is this, then? Huh? Look, he even forged my signature. Hmm! You are becoming like a criminal instead of studying well. I doubt, are you my son? Hey, I hail from a poor family, I used to go to school bear footed. I studied hard and became the first engineer from my village. Now I am at this stature. The society would never respect an illiterate man. You are about to graduate from your high school... this is a very crucial period for you. You'll do well in life, if you study hard. -Listen... -Yes. get that TV disconnected. My colleague Venkat Rao, he got his TV disconnected. His elder son bagged a seat in IIT, His second son has topped in his 10 standard. But, I am ashamed to speak about him. Disgusting! Dad! Hey! Didn't sleep yet? Dad, I need to talk to you. What is it, son? I am not at all interested in studies, dad. I love music! This is my passion. I don't want to study B. Tech and do a 9 to 5 job like any one else... I want to be something, I want to do something new. Dad, I want to do something which can make me standout from this crowd. Hey, give that to me. Dad... Dad... that's my favourite Guitar. Dad, I personally got it handcrafted for myself. Hey, you want to learn music and perform in weddings? I've allowed you to learn because, you said it was your hobby, I won't allow you to waste your time on music. Listen, I am running this family working in a 9 to 5 job. Not even one in a million can achieve that goal of yours. Be on the ground and use your brains. Your EAMCET exam is around the corner, concentrate on that. Don't be sad, your father spoke so for your good, isn't it? He spoke in anger. He is worried about your future. Where there is anger there is love, my son. One who loves us won't give us what we want... they will give what's right for us. Brother! I bought a chocolate for you. My dearest brother! Cheer up now. Smile. -Take it son. -Take it brother, please. -Smile! -Okay, it's already too late... stop thinking and go to bed. Good night. Let's go. Good night, brother. Your sister's marriage is in three days... won't you come home even now? You have issues with your father... then why are you venting out your anger on us? Mom, I just don't want to come home... if you want me to live in peace... leave me alone. Don't be sad mom, I will attend the marriage. Dude... dude... Enough man. Hey, this is just 90 ml, have it. What the hell is this...? No need of a glass, just give me the bottle I'll gulp it down! Fix a 90 ml for me as well, dude. Damn it! [mobile ringing] What's wrong, bro? Whose call was that? [indistinct chatter] [mobile ringing] [mobile rings continuously] -Hello. -Hello, Harry? -Tell me. -Tell you what...? Your behaviour has changed these days... not talking my calls, not replying to my messages, you became arrogant. What now? -Oh yeah! Let's break up. -Okay, break up! First give those 10,000 bucks you borrowed from me last month. Okay, send me your account number... -Repu chestha (Will transfer tomorrow). -Not tomorrow, I want now. Didn't I say, I'll transfer tomorrow? send me your account number, will transfer tomorrow. Not tomorrow, I want now. Didn't I say, I'll transfer tomorrow? Didn't I say, I'll transfer tomorrow? Will transfer tomorrow... Will transfer tomorrow... Dude! Repu chestha (Will transfer tomorrow). Damn her! [all] What the hell did you just say? [indistinct chatter] Brothers! Messing up with a girl basically means... unpinning a grenade and shoving up your arse! The word 'peace' doesn't exist in their dictionary. For instance, if you continuously keep calling her... they say 'don't you trust me, I never knew you had such cheap thoughts etc...' And if you don't call her... they say, 'you are ignoring me, you don't have time for me...' 'you are fu--' they put up a show that 'you are hanging out with someone else'. They are well behaved few days into the relationship... but later on, don't know if they have some mental disorder or something... they stalk us on FB, Insta and Twitter. If they find your pictures with some other girl... Gone... That's it we are gone! Then they run a semi break up phase for a few days, and in the mean time if we send a message... they will make us say sorry for atleast five hours. And, if we don't message her, they'll just wait and watch for a week or so... and would say, 'you don't have a heart. How can you cheat an innocent girl?' 'All men are dogs' like this, they will put up another crazy show. Whiskey! They effortlessly gulp down a bottle of whiskey and call themselves innocents! What the hell? All that I said till now happens without our mistake. And by any chance if the mistake is really ours... It's like a 'home run' for her. Our balls would be gone. They would never apologise... be it her mistake, she might vandalise your Benz aswell, but won't apologise. In any situation if we get mad at them, they'll get mad at us instead, because we are mad at them. We must apologise for our mistakes... apologise to them for their mistake... and apologise to them for doing nothing. Damn this, so called love! Can't they fend for us? Can't they work? Huh! Don't feminism and equality matter here? Basically they need an income source for their make-up kits and shopping. Suddenly they start comparing us with their fathers. My dad buys me everything I wish for, my dad is a great man... my dad is this, my dad is that, by saying all such stuff... they create a scenario that you would be ashamed of yourself. how can she compare your income with her father's... who has been earning for the past 30 years. Does that make any sense? Huh! Damn it! [mobile ringing] -Hello. -Siddhu! -Yeah babe. -I am alone at home, come fast. Okay babe, coming right away. What? Just now you read out a huge script, didn't you? -Hey, let's go. -Hey... We can trust Al-Qaeda terrorist but we should never trust Siddhu! [foreign music playing in background] Not bad! No... no... no... no love bites, my boy friend might feel bad. -You have a boy friend? -Yeah. Don't you think this is wrong? Excuse me! My life, my wish. Get out of the car. Why? My car, my wish. Asshole! Gather around boys and girls. An important announcement for you all, pay attention. This isn't an ordinary cake, it's mixed with a special ingredient. Don't waste it by rubbing on each others face and ass. All of you will get high after you have it. Let's party! [all cheering] -Hi, Sajiv! -Hey, hi! -How are you? -I am good. How are you? -I am good. -Meet my friend. Oh, hi! I am Swetha. -Hey... Hey! -What? Look there. -Siddhu, what is this? -It's nothing. -Siddhu, what is this? -I said it's nothing. Siddhu what do you mean by nothing? I am not blind. I can see, it's a love bite. Why are you getting serious? Did I ever tell you that I love you, let's get married and have kids? Be in your limits. Yeah right, as you guys say it... flings, time pass, friends with benefits... You think I am that timepass girl, right? Why are you creating a scene? I was never intimate with any one Siddhu. I got close to you thinking you might forget Nisha. But I am not someone you think. I am not creating a scene Siddhu. I am madly in love with you. Yes, I love you! But, now I realised you would never understand me. Siddhu, there's tons of difference between love, infatuation and lust. These many days I thought you don't love me. Now I understood that you don't even like me. It's over Siddhu, bye. What the hell! [all cheering] Oh God! [indistinct voices at distance] Shit! I am done... where's the hand wash? -It's down stairs. -Okay, I'll be right back. -Hey, I am sorry. -It's okay, I am just smoking. Can I join? Yeah, have it. By the way, who are you? I am Swetha, Sajiv's friend. Oh! [all cheering] What's wrong? Sajiv! Party is over, all of you leave. -Where's beer bro? -Sajiv! Party is over, all of you leave. Hey, it's not what you think. Nothing happened. Hey, you have no morals. Can't expect any thing less from a guy who doesn't care about his parents. You don't know how to value friendship and relationship. -Sajiv, leave him bro. -You trapped Nisha behind my back. -And now... Damn you! -Hey. Nisha did a good thing by dumping you. What's wrong with you man? Hey, Siddhu! Do you know what you are talking? What do you know about him to decide his character? And how can you say he trapped Nisha? Do you even know what really happened? -Nisha! -Yes. Tell me. Tell me Siddhu. Nothing, I called you casually. I am a Psychology student and I know you want to say something. You can't fool me easily. Now tell me what's the matter? -Well. -Come on. tell me. -I mean. -Go on. Nisha, I never got so close to someone in my life. I mean, it's a great feeling, it feels good... You and me living the moment. I feel, it would be great if we remain like this for ever. Nisha...! What's wrong? As you said, these moments feel so good Siddhu. But we can't predict they would be the same for ever, right? Even my parents fell in love and got married. But, after a certain point in life, they broke up. Eventually when ego, possessiveness, circumstances... if these takeover, love will fade Siddhu. People change Siddhu. Circumstances make them change. I don't trust in love and relationships Siddhu. Come, sit with me. Nisha, because your parents had a fall out you have this false perception, but there are many couples who are living happily. Nobody is happy Siddhu. It depends on our point of view Nisha. Your negative thoughts make you think so. What do you want me to do now? I am asking you to give me a chance Nisha and nothing else. To whom? Just try and give yourself a chance Nisha. Life would seem new to you. How could you decide that relationship crap without experiencing it? -Three months. -What three months? Let's live in together for three months... If this works out then we will consider it. Okay. But there are some rules, if you break the rules it would anger me. Okay, go on. Rule number one... Never raise your voice or your hand on me. Rule number two... You must never abuse me. And if I abuse you, you must not feel bad. I will get angry if you use cuss words. Rule number three and the most important one... Don't do this, don't do that, don't go here and there... Don't wear this and that... If you keep such restrictions... I swear I will kill you! Okay. -Sounds great. -What? Nothing, you continue. Just remember one thing, I am an independent, strong and a self sufficient woman. Just remember that, everything else is as you wish... -Agreed? -Agreed. Okay... Hey... hey. You said rest of it is my wish? "Love is saying let's go, love has made us one" "Shall we race, my dear" "Love is an unceasing intoxication, love keeps the youth going" -"So, shall we say, yes we do?" -Siddhu. -What happened? -I don't want to go. "If you are with me, I would forget myself" -"If you say yes, I'll become you" - [all] Happy Birthday. "Let's take time as hostage in our embrace" "Let's live happily ever after" -"Love is saying let's go..." -Hey... -"love has made us one" -She's Nisha. -Who is she, is she your friend? Hi! -She is my sister. She is my sister. Oh... Hi! Who is she bro? Is she your girl friend? I knew that you are upto something as you are not coming home these days. But you've started a family altogether. Enough of feeling shy, come I need to talk to you. -What should I do? -Manage somehow. Nice! Very nice! So the matter has come this far? -"You are my hope, you are my breath" -What are they talking about man? -"You are the promise made by the time" -Don't know bro. Bro, it won't take much time for two girls to be enemies or friends, right? -This boy is crazy right? -Yeah. -Bye, Sindhu. -Okay. Okay, are you leaving? Stop asking questions and drop me home. -I mean, Nisha will be alone, right? -Is it? -Anand will drop you. -Okay. -Hey, Anand. -Yes. -Bye. Convey my regards to mom. -Will do. -What did you talk about? -I won't say. Siddhu, don't you have girlfriends in college? Our boy is like 'feel my love' type of guy. Many girls tried to flirt with him, but he ignored them all. Siddhu! -Stop it, guys. -Way to go, bro. By the way, I heard you used to play guitar... why didn't you play in front of me? [voices muted] "Love is saying let's go, love has made us one" "Shall we race, my dear" Damn! Look at this. Guys, does any body know where Nisha went? Don't know bro. [out of network] Did you try calling her? [out of network tone] I'm trying but it says, not reachable. She must have gone out somewhere, don't worry. Stop worrying man, is she a kid or what? She will come back. Come sit, let's chill, man. [door bell rings] [humming] Hey, what's up! Nisha, when did you come? Want some pop corn? -Siddhu, what about you? -Hey, come here man. -What man? -Keep quite. -Where did you go? -Hmm. Where have you been since morning? I went for a party at a friends place, Siddhu. You could've told me, right? Do you know how tensed I was, and how many times did I call you? My phone switched off, is it my mistake? -Why create a scene for this? -Damn it! Do you know how tensed I was? I've gone mad since morning. Why are you so egoistic? Siddhu, I've already told you... I hate it when someone yells at me. Forget it, you would never understand. Nisha, please. Nisha I am sorry, please listen to me. -Nisha-- -Siddhu, you broke the remote today... tomorrow you would do the same to me. Nisha I am sorry, this would never happen again. Just give me one chance Nisha... Nisha... Listen to me, I am sorry... this would never happen again. I swear. Just one last chance. Please Nisha. Fine. Ouch! What happened? Vishal, when he came to Hyderabad last year for a project work, met me through a mutual friend. He seemed like a really nice guy in the beginning. That is why I became friends with him. We used to meet casually. But one day when I was drunk in a party, he tried to take advantage. I gave him a tight slap. After that I stopped meeting him, or replying to him. Then, he used to send some stupid messages. He used to stalk me wherever I go. Today he came to the party. And that day he came to the pub too. That is why I took you out from there. You should have filed a complaint against him? Huh, girls face these things everyday. If we start giving complaints half of the boys stay behind the bars. Still, I didn't take that step, because he would realize someday. -Where does he live? -Why? Will you beat him? I must trash such a guy. Siddhu, no. Don't do such things. I can handle myself. I know how to handle such situations, okay? Siddhu... Wake up. I need to go to the saloon. Siddhu... -Let me sleep, Nisha. -Please, Siddhu. Get up! [camera captures] [camera captures] Nisha, I will park the car and join you. Um, you go and come back after 2 hours to pick me. Okay? Bye. Hi! How are you, guys? Okay, let's go. [vehicle honks] Damn! Damn... Damn it! Argh! Damn! Damn it! Hey, get lost! The number you are calling is out of network coverage area... The number you are calling is out of network... The number you are calling is out of network... Huh, your mobile. Hey! Ah! Hey! Hey! Ah! Siddhu please leave them. Ah! Ah! Hey! OW! Siddhu, please leave them. Hey! [groans in pain] [siren wailing] Hey, stop! Hey, stop it! Siddhu. Come on. Siddhu... Siddhu. [siren wailing] Don't tell stories, huh! See sir, how he trashed me. You must... Look how he is staring, sir. I don't know what you will do, sir. He must be behind the bars, no matter how much it may cost. -Sir. -Tell me? -I need to file a complaint. -What's your complaint? Leave me. Harassment and attempt to rape. -On whom? -On him, sir. Yeah, you should say... [disco music playing] -Nisha? -Oh God! Nisha, please listen to me. Come on. Vishal, how many times should I tell you? Nisha, I am sorry. I am sorry. I troubled you so much. I think that is why this happened to me. What happened? I am suffering from a brain tumour, Nisha. I am going to London for treatment, tomorrow morning. I came to meet you for one last time and apologize to you. Yeah, I am sorry, Nisha. It's okay, Vishal, don't feel bad. Everything is gonna be alright. Your have a very good heart, Nisha. I understand how much grave mistakes I have done by hurting you. Not all this, Nisha. Let's start it from beginning. Let's be good friends. Sure. I feel like having a drink together one last time. I mean, I don't know when I am going to meet again. Your favourite French wine is in my car. -What are you thinking? -Huh? Nothing, -let's go. -Yeah. Nisha, what's that? What? Where? -Huh? -Oh, it's a mosquito. Too much. -There you go. -Thank you. Cheers. It's nice. Idiot! Come, man. Come on. Will you compromise? Siddhu... Siddhu? Siddhu... Siddhu... Siddhu... Please listen to me. Siddhu, please wait. Siddhu... Siddhu, please. Siddhu, listen to me. Nothing happened like you are thinking. -Argh!-Siddhu, please open the door. Siddhu... Siddhu, please. Damn! Siddhu... Siddhu, please. Siddhu, I will not go anywhere without telling you. Hey, wait, dude. -Please listen to me for once. -It will get settled if you go. But they need understanding not compromising. I am sorry for everything. Siddhu, please open the door. Siddhu... [sobs] Siddhu, I will do whatever you say. Please listen to me once, Siddhu. [sobs] [door opens] Siddhu... Siddhu, please listen to me once. Siddhu, please. Siddhu... Siddhu. -Siddhu, listen-- -What will you say, Nisha? Huh? What will you say? First I will tell you something, just listen. Do you know what is the strongest relationship in this world, Nisha? The relationship between a husband and a wife. Because, in this world our parents, siblings, friends, we just have emotional attachment only, Nisha. But only between a husband and a wife has, physical and emotional attachment, Nisha. Nisha, whenever we get physical, I never felt like I am touching your body. I felt like I was touching your soul. I never felt such feeling in my life on anyone. Nisha, I trashed him not because you did something wrong. In that moment when he was touching you... I felt like some idiot is touching my wife, Nisha. I never felt like this on anyone. There might not be the formality of marriage, or auspicious thread in your neck, but for me this is love and marriage. Nisha, listen to me carefully. I don't freaking care no matter how many problems arise, whatever happens I don't care, no matter how many people come I don't care. Even if you cheat me I don't care. I just love you, Nisha. I really love you, Nisha. "The world..." "is elated like the dawn" "The life..." "Has greeted us gracefully" "The world is elated like the dawn" "The life has greeted us gracefully" "Same hope..." "Same attention..." "In you and me..." "Isn't it the same?" "Same hope..." "Same attention..." "In you and me..." "Isn't it the same?" "To see..." "To see..." "Happiness in your eyes" "To change..."

Wow, the climate is very good. Nisha? What happened, Nisha? What are you doing alone? Nothing, I am missing my dad, Siddhu. Today it's his birthday. I used to wish him first every year since my childhood. It's my dad who I loved more than anyone in this world. But it's been 10 years that I spoke to him. What happened? When I was in 7th standard, they chose to get divorced. I shifted to Pune with my mom and grandpa. I couldn't stay without dad. I used to wait for him everyday. But he wouldn't even call as he was angry on mom. There is no day that I didn't cry for him. My mom used to say one thing whenever I cry... 'Loving doesn't mean being with the person together,' 'but wishing for them to be happy wherever they are.' It's okay, don't feel bad. Hey, Siddhu! Beer and biryani are waiting. -Come fast! -Let's go. Nisha... You know what? You are the most beautiful person on this planet. -Siddhu, get up! -Hey! Hey, sleep inside. -Come. Careful. -You are my sweetheart. Nisha, I love you. Nisha. Nisha, never leave me. -I can't bear it. -Nisha... I haven't seen him so serious about anyone in life. You are his weakness. Never leave him. Nisha, I love you. -Hey, where is Nisha? -I don't know, dude... I think she is on terrace. -What happened, dude? -No, idea. [sobs] Nisha? Nisha, what are you doing here? -What happened, Nisha? -Siddhu... Dad's health isn't good. I got a call from my uncle. I have to go. I am very scared. -Take care. -Hmm. Take care, Siddhu. -Bye. -Bye, dear. Siddhu, don't call or message me. It will be a problem if dad finds out. I will call you whenever I get a chance. I will be back in a month. Bye, Siddhu. The number you are calling is out of network coverage area. Please try later. [thunders rumbling] The number you are calling is out of network coverage area. "I am left alone to live like a rock" "Alone without you by my side" "I am left alone to live like a rock" "Alone without you by my side" "You are in my heart" "You vanished like a dream" "Come to me, you are mine" "Won't you be my shadow?"

Nisha... -Where did you go, Nisha? -Siddhu? You told you will be back in a month and where did you leave? Nisha, don't leave me ever. I love you, Nisha. I love you, Nisha. Nisha! Uncle... Uncle, please understand what I am saying. I love Nisha. I will take very good care of her. Please uncle, I can't live without her. What's your age? I am 22 years old, uncle. Do you know Nisha's age? I know that she is 3 years elder to me, so what? Bring your father once, we will have a talk. Coming straight to the point, your son is in love with my daughter, do you know that? I know, sir. What does your son do? Wait, let your dad talk. You tell me, sir. Oh! Where is he working? That is, he has few backlogs, sir. Do you have a daughter, sir? Sir? -I mean, do you have a daughter? -I do. I will ask you a question, tell me the answer heartfully. A person who don't even have a basic degree, who can't look after himself, moreover he is younger than the girl, suddenly one day he comes to you... and say that he is in love with your daughter, get her married to me. Will you do? Tell me, sir. I won't, sir. Thank you, sir. Please don't disturb us anymore. Please leave. Do you understand what you are talking? Why don't you talk anything, when your dad is talking nonsense? Hey! -Hey! -You wait dad. You left your daughter and wife long back, what do you know about love? -Do you know what you are talking? -What are you talking? -Hey, Siddhu, stop it! -Hey! Sorry, sir. Move! Nisha, come. Hey! [ringer rings] [keys clinks] Brother... Wait, bro. Please open the shop. I have closed it, no, brother. -Give me a beer, bro. -We are closed. We have problem with cops, brother. -Let me go, brother. I can't. -I asked you a beer, man! -Hey, how dare you catch my collar? -Give me one beer. [grunts] How dare you catch my collar? How dare you hit me? [grunts] Leave me, man! Leave me. [commotion] [commotion] -Hey! -Ah! Ow! Come, bro. -Hey, what happened? -He is asking for drugs. [ringer rings] Hello? Hey... You told someone has stuff, do you have his contact? Please send it, man. Send it right away. I can't wait, send it right away. Send it soon. Bro, I have got all the Nigerian stuff in my bag. This is cocaine. It's my breakfast. Look at this. I have all the drugs in the world. Take whatever you want. That's paper. If you keep it under your tongue, you will see another world... Within half an hour. You will fly in the streets of the sky. Huh, have it. I will call you if I get new stock. Bye. [trance music] [bass thumping] [thunders rumbling] [doorbell rings] [thunders rumbling] -Nisha, where did you go? -Siddhu? Siddhu... -Please, never leave me, Nisha. -Siddhu... I can't bear it, Nisha. Nisha, please... -I am unable to do it, Nisha. -Siddhu... Nisha? Nisha... Nisha... Nisha! -Nisha? -Hey! -Nisha? -What happened, dude? Nisha was here. -What are you talking, man? -Please believe me, guys. -Trust me, she was really here. -Hey, calm down, man. -Hey, Nisha was here. -Courier, sir. Please believe me, guys. -Nisha was... -Sign here. Hey, what happened to him? -Hey, please trust me. -Hey, she wasn't here. She came last night. We were right here since morning no one came. Oh no! How will you trust me, guys? -Hey, Nisha is gone. Forget about her. -[sobs] Hey! Siddhu, I didn't ask you anything since we first met. I am asking for the first time. If your love is true. If you really love me, then never come for me, Siddhu. Bye, Siddhu. [sobbing] [sobbing] Where is Siddhu? Uncle... Uncle! Uncle... Uncle... Please stop! At least you make him understand. What should I say? Huh? What should I say? He will listen to you. He won't man. I never listen to him that he would listen to me now. I raised him like a normal father thinking about the society. Fearing about his future, I didn't give him anything he wanted. Not because I don't love him. But because of responsibility. Seeing him like this, I understand my mistake. How much I may think, it hurts here that, I am also the reason that he become like this. I am left like just a father, but couldn't become his friend. Hey, you both are childhood friends. You take care of my son. He will only listen to you. Please take care of him. Hey, if we don't let go of the past, it will become the reason for our pain. He will know someday. I will be waiting for that day. Take care of him. Bro... I have got new stock from Kazakhstan. It's imported. You will feel better if you try it. Just 60,000/- See you, brother. [singing random Hindi song] [humming] [humming] Hey, hey! Hey! -Stop! How dare you sell drugs? -What is it, man? Ah! Ow! -My friend is crying there. -Hey, let me go. Do you know it's been so long that we have seen him happy? Hey, move! Leave! -Hey! -Hey, how dare you sell drugs? -Hey! -Catch him, dude. -Hey! -Hey, chase him! Dude, chase him. Hey, if I see you again I will kill you. Hey, Anand... I think he will get angry for this. Where did I keep it? Damn it! -Hey, have you seen my stuff anywhere? -Don't know, dude. I don't know, man. The number you are calling is out of network coverage area. The number you are calling is out of network coverage area. Hey, what happened, man? -Hey, hey! Dude... -Hey! -Hey, leave me. -Hey, what happened? -Hey! Hey! -Leave me, guys! -I want Nisha... -Wait, man! Control yourself. -Listen to us, Siddhu. -Please... Siddhu, calm down. I want Nisha. I want Nisha. I want Nisha. -Hey! Hey! -I want Nisha back. -[sobbing] -Siddhu, please. Calm down. Wait, dude. Hey, what happened? -Nisha will come back. -Calm down, dude. -Calm down. -Why do you need all this? -I couldn't bear. -You take rest. -I want Nisha. -Everything will get settled. Sleep for sometime, come, let's go. -Hey! Hey! -Hey, come! -Hey! Siddhu! -Hey! Hey! Hey, please, dude. -Let it go. -Cool down, dude. -Get up. -It's not happening, guys. -Sleep for sometime. -Get up. -Get up. Come on. -Come. -First take him inside. -Come on. -Hey! -Ah? What the hell, man! Hey, Siddhu what are you doing here? Hey, come on! Come out, first! What the... Hey, come, let's go out. Come out. Guys, come out quick. The toughest war in this world is the war with yourself. Your friend is in that situation. Your friend is suffering with a clinical depression. In this situation his heart is very sensitive, similarly his brain will be dangerous. And we can't say how he would react in any situation. Sir, how much time it would take for him to be normal? Can't say. It might happen in a month, or in a year, or a life time. But he can change in a second if he wants. But he must take the initiative. Try to explain him and let him do what he want. As of now, Nitrazepam. An anti depression tablet. We shouldn't give more than one per day. It's a high dose sleeping pill. We give this tablet to those who are very much depressed psychologically. And remember only before sleep, okay? Siddhu, we shouldn't stay the same no matter how many things might happen, we need to move on. Please, understand. This is life. Live like you want. Do whatever you like. But come out of this. [door opens] You just be happy. Dude, start it from the beginning.

By the way, what is your name? Lisa... Come baby. Hey, Rock star! Who is the girl that left you? [birds chirping] Lisa. What the... [birds chirping] Hey, he is South Rock star, right? Yes, brother. It's him. He came on YouTube yesterday. Let's tease him. Hey, crazy... -Rock star... -[laughs] Did the girl run away? Huh? Hey! Ah! Ow! Ah! Ah! Ow! Hey, you bastard! Ah! Ow! Ah! Hey, you! Are you mad? Hey! Hey! Hey, stop! You bastard! Hey! [groans] [roars] Hey! Who is that? Hey, wait! Stop, you bastard! Bloody, stop! I will kill you, stop! Hey, stop! [panting] Hey, stop! Stop, you bastard! As per clause 11 B of the agreement, Dharma Music is not accountable for any misbehaviour of its artist. And has complete authority to cancel the agreement, upon or in any such circumstances. From today Siddhu is not a part of Dharma Music. Is he a rock star or a monster. Video of the son of a local minister who was trashed by Siddhu is getting viral, who shook India with the album Aakasa Veedullo. The judiciary has sent the notice to Siddhu, to attend the High court of Hyderabad. As the video is getting viral in which Siddhu was trashing minister's son, but we couldn't see any response from the ministers. Few locals state that Siddhu trashed them because, minister's son used unparliamentary language. Is he a role model to look up to? You are not a freaking rock star brother, you are behaving like a freaking monster. You were this close for your life and your passion. You ruined your life with your own hands, dude. Lower your voice, idiot! What are you talking? Reality... Freaking reality. Hey, you trashed local minister's son of Himachal! He called the music company people and warned them if you don't cancel the deal ...with you he would shut their company down. [indistinct voices] [birds chirping] [cicadas chirping] I lived listening to others these many days. I did everything like they said. I quit music when they told me I can't do it. But my dad who respected me so much, a girl who I loved so much except that no one understood me. I lived these many days listening to my dad, society and everyone. But that Siddhu is dead now. You all killed him. I am telling everyone of you, show every person who says you can't do it by doing it. Show them that there is no one in this world great than you. Show that your inner world is more vast than the outer world. Now every freaking person listen to me clearly, you need not have to listen to anyone. Why should we do? Tell them you need not have to listen to anyone. Bye. [thunders rumbling] Hey! Sorry, Siddhu. I said many things without knowing what has happened. I am really sorry. Hey, I couldn't bear, when some unknown girl was cheating her boyfriend. How did you think that I would betray my friend? I didn't trap Nisha. I loved her. Anyway chuck it. At least now you understood me. Thanks dude. Hey, chill! -It's done, dude. -Everyone should chill. -Let's just chill, that's it. -Let's party hard. [mobile rings] Hey, hey! One moment... Hello? Amar? What happened, Amar? Hello? Hey, let's go. Hey, Amar! -Siddhu? -What happened? Someone recorded our concert song and uploaded it on YouTube. It's trending on YouTube right now. Hey, Dharma sir wants you to meet immediately. -Hi, guys! Is he here? -Yeah. Come fast, sir is waiting for you. -Yeah. -Siddhu, one moment. Amar, hold this. Turn around. Perfect. Alcohol, drugs and girls... Controversies, what not? The young famous rock star! With one song, you rocked 4 years ago. I waited like every other fan, not knowing what happened after that. Then I saw your new song which is getting viral. One more song, one more sensation. Millions of likes and comments. 'Siddhu you are awesome...' That and this... Woo! You know all this. But when I followed these comments clearly, I have found a video. Brother, myself Sai. I am a taxi driver. I am a big fan of yours. I am also crazy about guitar. But because my father died in an accident 6 years ago... To take care of my mother and sister, I started driving auto. I went to the hospital when I got swelling 3 years ago. I turned out to be cancer. We have sold our properties for the treatment. Seeing my situation my mom and sister started working. They said there is no use even if we spend lot of money. When I was suffering leaving my hopes behind, my sister showed me your song. Your song made me remembered at once who I am and what I want. Without doing what I should do, I thought how would this disease kill me? I am taking treatment and started to practice music again. I don't know, but once I hold the guitar, I felt like my life came back which I thought was gone. Knowing your song got viral again on YouTube... I felt very happy. This is you? Your song conquered over my death. You aren't what the media and news papers portray. You are different brother. Forget about everything and make songs for people like us regularly. Please, you must sing again. Your voice isn't your strength, Siddhu. It's the life you experienced. The fame some people couldn't get even if they work hard for their whole life, you got it with one song. And you proved it again with this song. You are a miracle Siddhu. You know butterfly effect? Every situation happening to you in your life has made you this today. Your pain is the boon nature gave you. You must realise it. -Anvith. -Sir? One side 3 years contract with Dharma Music, albums, music videos, movies... Do what you like. I will invest the money. You will get the life which you wished for. Take your time. But promise me one thing, come back as reformed Siddhu. The world is waiting for you. Other side, your old life... And your old habits. Choose... Choose one. Thank you sir. Thanks a lot. Don't thank me, thank him. He is the one who showed me this video. -Thanks a lot. -My pleasure. Actually you must thank my wife not me. She is a huge fan of yours. In fact, you were introduced to me like that. Why not come over to my place for dinner today? She will also feel very happy. Hey! Damn! -Hey! -Hey! -Hey, it's okay. -Sorry sir. Sorry sir. -Sir, you are Siddhu, right? -Yeah. I listen to your songs so much, sir. Sir, shake hand... Sorry sir... -I will clean it. -It's okay... Sorry sir. -Oh, fans. -Yeah. What you say, shall we go? My friends are waiting outside. No problem... we'll take them as well. -And my shirt... -Yeah, I got it. Please come in... Come. Nisha. Where did you go? Do you know how much tensed I was? Don't ask me anything, it was very hectic since morning. I am extremely tired. By the way, see who is here. I will freshen up and come, mean while, make them seated. Okay? Siddhu... Siddhu? What Siddhu? Huh? What? The person who was very close in this world, the person who I thought is more than everyone in this life, if suddenly one day without saying a word just left a letter. What was that? I shouldn't come for you ever, if I had loved you truly? Have you lost-- Why did you stop? Scold me, Siddhu... Not just scolding... Hit me if you want. If you feel better that way, go on! Hit me! Honestly, did you love me? You just used me, right? In these 3 years did you ever try to find out how I was doing? You are happy after getting married. It is your decision that we met. Leaving me was also your decision. But you gave few things which can't be inevitable, your touch, your smell, most importantly your memories... It is more difficult to forget memories than people. There is not even a single second that I didn't think of you in these 3 years. I've had a lot of sleepless nights. My head would break. Weed, drugs, alcohol, all these were just an escape from the reality. I know they were killing me from inside. But I don't have another option to numb this pain. Nisha, why did you leave me? Didn't you at least think that I deserved an explanation? You do deserve an explanation, Siddhu. But you haven't given me a chance. You got so addicted after I left, and you were completely out of your senses. I came to talk to you that night. The very next day was my marriage. I came to sort out everything that day. But I didn't understand how to react seeing you high. One side the pain that you have changed like that. Other side with the fear how you would react if I say something, I couldn't even breath, Siddhu. I made love to you, even I was getting married the next day. Because, I understood that moment... How much I love you. This is not easy for a girl, Siddhu. You love me so much, then you should have stayed, right? Don't you know, what you are for me? You get worried if you don't see me for a second. You feel so much if I say a small thing. You will be scared thinking something is going to happen to me. 24/7 I have become your world, Siddhu. Your happiness was depended on my decision. I thought to become your strength. But I have become your weakness. Before I came in your life, you used to at least be peaceful. But you are getting angry and frustrated because of me. I felt like I am the only reason for all the problems. I felt like it was all because of me. I felt like I have disturbed your pain and emotions. I felt you deserve someone better. I thought many days and made up my mind. And one day I left. I thought to take your problem away, but the thought of getting away from you makes me cry. Siddhu... In my view loving means, not staying close to a person, but that person must be happy even if we are not near. After feeling I am the reason to all your problems in your life... I couldn't stay Siddhu. Siddhu, my dad is the reason that I got married. The reason I left you is for you to be happy, Siddhu. Siddhu... Love isn't just enough for two persons to live together, compatibility is more important than love. We both are impulsive and emotional. Look, we will cry like this if we quarrel. We don't know how to handle each other. We are not right for each other, Siddhu. Siddhu, please. From now on, leave everything behind and move on. Siddhu... Siddhu. You must be happy. If you hide your pain and anger inside, it means, your heart is taking so much stress. Leave everything and move on. Please. Think only about your happiness. Please Siddhu. Siddhu... [music mutes voices] [mobile rings] -Hello? -Hey Siddhu, where are you? Dad, I am in Goa for a concert, tell me? Hey, even Sindhu got married. What about you, when are you going to get married? I can get married any time. But I should get someone I like, right? Wow! But when? They will come, dad. Hey, Siddhu! -Hi. -Oh my God! -Hello? -Hey! -Hello, Siddhu? -One selfie please. -Brother, only one selfie. -Only one. -Please allow us, brother. -You can't go inside. -Only one selfie, brother. -One selfie, brother. Siddhu, brother. -Brother... -Siddhu, please sir. What? You are not allowed? Madam, you can't go in. Sorry, no entry. You know who I am? I am Siddhu's girl friend. We are in relationship since five years, you know? Hey, Nisha! Please understand madam. No entry, madam. Outers are not permitted, madam. Sorry. Hello? Dad, I will call you later. Everyone are going, I want to take a selfie. Hey! Let them in. Let's go. Side please. You won't leave if a guy is handsome, you just try to take advantage. Go! Go! I lied to them to meet you. But you are so cute, so adorable. How did she leave you? Damn! If it was me, I wouldn't have left you. -Selfie? -Yeah. Please just give a smile, boss. You look sexy, if you laugh. [camera captures] Hey! -Hey! What are you doing? -Hey, one second... -Oh no! Sorry sir! -Boss... Hey... Will you marry me? Let's go, mad girl. Life long commitment. I will hug you tight and give you many kisses like this. -Sorry sir. -Think about it! -Come, let's go. -Let's go. Did you see? That's how it would be. -Nisha, will you marry me? -Huh? Will you marry me? Hey! Nisha? Nisha? Yes! Yes! [wedding percussions] [music mutes voices]
