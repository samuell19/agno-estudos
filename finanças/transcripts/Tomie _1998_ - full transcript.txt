TOMIE - Sorry. I'm late. - How was it? - He was just lecturing me. - I knew it. - He asked me if I'm all right. - Really? - I'm going home. - Are you sure, Kazumi? Kazumi! What? Aren't you being a little cruel? Why? Aren't you being crazy? She called me crazy. She is just in a bad mood about the other day. I don't know. Just leave her alone. Check this out. What do you think? Kaori, are you going to put this picture in the show? Is it bad? Well, they are not that bad. That's it? Well, I guess I'm not that talented after all. It's not talent you lack. You just don't want to do it. Hello? Oh, yes. Yes, it's fine. Did I tell you my cell number? I don't mind. Really? I don't think so. Please call me if something happens. Ah, that light bulb is broken. I meant to change it, but I forgot. 'Bye. - Hello. - Hello. Don't fight with your new downstairs neighbor this time. Has a new person moved in? Yeah. He is a student who recently graduated high school. He seems quiet unlike the last one. You don't have to worry. I hope so. Don't worry. He studies hard and stays home all day. 'Bye. There are strange kids out there these days. Lock the door. 'Bye. You were hungry, weren't you. I'm sorry. Here. How is it? Don't eat that kind of thing! Okay, Miss Izumisawa. You will awake on the count of three. One... Two... Three. How do you feel? I feel refreshed. That's good. Some say they sometimes don't feel refreshed. - Could you leave us alone? - Yes. - Sit down. - Thanks. It has become clear that you have memory loss. You don't have any memories from the accident three years ago. Will the memories come back to me? In our last session, you spoke of your need to remember. Why? I moved out of the house. Because of that, my mother and I don't get along well. It upsets me that I can't remember the accident. I want to know. May I have one of those? Sure. I dream every night. Once I'm awake, I can't get back to sleep. You can't sleep? Are you taking your medication? Yes. What kind of dream? I am not sure. But in my dream, I am always covered by blood. What? Again? Aren't you always fighting with somebody these days? I don't like the group of girls. Where is the cheese? Behind the shelf. Do you think she broke your bicycle, too? No way. I don't think a girl can bend a bicycle. Here. Ready for table 1. What are you doing? It's summer homework. I will start eating. Why don't you eat? Yeah -- in one second. Stop pretending to be a photographer. Why are you mad at me? I am not mad at you. You are mad. Why do you get mad so easily? I made it for you. All I am saying is that I want you to eat now. Thank you. It's delicious! It's good. It's very good. Hello. Yeah. I just got back home. What? Nothing is new. What? Ah- I can't go home. I have an exhibition at school. Don't nag me. I know. How many ceremonies did you have? It's just an excuse for the family to get together. Hello? HOSONO CLINIC PSYCHIATRY AND NEUROLOGY Hello. An emergency patient came. Could you wait for a second? Please make an appointment fear your next visit. Please take your medication. Yumi. Please come in. She should have medicine left. You don't have to give her more today. Thanks for waiting. Come in. Could you give me more medicine? You don't have any left? I feel anxious if it's gone. I'm sorry. There was an emergency patient. Sit down. Did you just laugh at me? Let's go home. Are you making fun of me? - You have to go back to work. - Did you listen to me today? - Yes, I did very well. - Do you remember what I said? Yes, I remember. I will listen to you again tomorrow. Okay. Let's continue on from the last time. You might have a memory of the accident subconsciously. What is funny? I'm sorry. It's weird to use hypnosis to find out why I can't sleep. It's not hypnosis. It's called hypnotherapy. It's not popular in Japan. Not many doctors do this. Yumi, please take care of this. - Doctor? - What? Why do I feel like I want to die when I lack sleep? Well, let's begin. Breathe very slowly. Release the tension from your body. What are you going to do with them? What are you going to do? What did you do to Tanabe? MOTHER. FATHER (DEAD). TRAFFIC ACCIDENT. TANABE What are you going to do? Tomie-- What are you going to do? Tomie-- TOMIE? CRIMINAL INVESTIGATOR POLICE DEPARTMENT SHOUJI HARADA The girl with her face scratched out... came to this school one month before this picture was taken. Three months after that... this class broke up. The suicides: one, two, three, and four. Students who were sent to mental hospitals... including this teacher, numbered seven. The other students soon transferred to different schools. Well, we don't know what happened. But one thing is certain. This transfer student suddenly-- Where did I put-- She suddenly disappeared. And she is still missing. Ah, can I smoke? Go ahead. Nowadays, people hate detectives. It's because every detective smokes. Would you give me one of those? What? Yes. Of course. Are you sure cigarettes are the reason? You are harsh. One of the classmates killed this girl... and they cut her into pieces and threw her away. Some students testified to this, but there was no evidence. We, the police, are at a loss. We smoke more, and people hate us more. I still don't know why you came to me. Oh, I'm sorry. This missing girl-- Her name is Kawakami Tomie. Kawakami Tomie. Have you heard her name before? In an investigation three years ago by the Gifu Police Department... the same name came up. Kawakami Tomie. It seems it's not only the same name, but she is the same person. She was killed by one of her classmates. The name of the murderer is-- Well-- Oops. Excuse me. The name of the murderer is-- Here. Tanabe Kouji. We had irrefutable evidence and testimony. But somehow the body disappeared from the scene. So, this case is still unsolved after all. And... the place where Kawakami Tomie was murdered in Gifu was... one of your patient's... Izumisawa Tsukiko's room. Kawakami Tomie transferred to Izumisawa Tsukiko's high school. They quickly became friends. But Tsukiko's boyfriend at that time, Tanabe... fell in love with Tomie. Well, that kind of story happens all the time. I suspect that Izumisawa Tsukiko consulted with you about that case. She doesn't remember anything. I know. When she was found in her room, she didn't remember anything. Her mother didn't want to tell her the truth... and told her it was a traffic accident, right? She believes so. She even made her transfer to another school. A mother's love. But what about now? Does she remember anything about the case? She still doesn't remember. She came to me because she can't sleep. She can't sleep. That's interesting. What does it mean? Kawakami Tomie was killed... in Gifu three years ago... and in my case, as well. To sum up, She was killed twice. To tell you the truth... besides these two cases, in the list of unsolved cases... her name is recorded many times. The oldest case... dates from the early Meiji period. Kawakami Tomie. Who is she? It seems like this will be my life's work. Here. Eat it. I don't want it. You said you wanted it! Don't get mad! Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm a little tired. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Could you put them down a little easier? Shut up and wash these now. Little boy. Do something about her. "Shut up and wash them now, little boy." Hey, wash them a little more quietly. What are you doing?! - Good morning. - Don't do that, Daisuke. - Work, Yuichi. - Hey. - Did you save the studio? - Yeah. I made an appointment. - Give me back the rental tee. - I will pay you back later. You didn't pay me back last time. I paid last time. Carbonara, pepperoncini, garlic toast, coffee... Caesar salad, anchovy and olive pizza--that's it. Carbonara, pepperoncini, garlic toast, coffee-- What's this? I can't read this. Well, good luck, little boy. Yeah? Hello? Yeah. What's up? Could you sell the tickets for my concert again? Again? No. I don't want to. The place is big this time. It won't be good without people. - Please. - No one will buy your tickets. If you want people, Why don't you just give them away? Don't kid with me. My band is in crisis. If things don't go well next time, we might have to break up. What will you do if your band breaks up? I will probably find a job. What kind of job? I am thinking about continuing as a chef. - A chef? - Yeah. That's not a bad idea. "Not a bad idea," huh? What are you going to do? What? Your future. My future? Let's see-- My future-- I am not thinking about it. Don't you want to be a photographer? There's no way I can be one. I don't want to. Anyway. What? Maybe I will tell Tsukiko about us. Are you kidding me? Oh, well. It's more fun doing it in secret, anyway. Let's hide it well. MONSTER GIRL Hello? Who is this? Kazumi? Is this Kazumi? Well, could you move a little to the right? Great. That's good. Sorry. I called you up suddenly. Just take pictures now. Why do you have to take pictures in the middle of the night? Is something wrong? A little bit. One of my friends might have done something bad to me. - What is it? - It's a secret. Who is the friend? Could you hug me from behind? Not there. Put your hands lower. - Like this? - Tighter! What is the meaning of this picture? No meaning. I just feel like this now. Hey. Stop it. I don't understand you sometimes. Somehow I am getting a hard on. Don't betray me. What? Did you kill her properly? We shouldn't be together anymore. What is wrong? What happened? What's wrong? What happened? Did it hurt? That must hurt. It was nail polish remover. I'm sorry. Does it hurt? I'm sorry. You... ...are getting worse. Don't you think so? It's hard for me to look at you. Please. I beg you. Please don't leave me! Don't look at me with those sad eyes. I will do anything for you! Please don't leave me. I will do anything for you. Anything. Please. Will you truly do anything for me? Yeah. I will do anything. Then... die already! I said, don't let anyone! A housewife walking her dog found it. Poor girl. Yeah. She was found by a dog. What? Saiga. Saiga. Come here, Saiga. Our new worker. Nice to meet you. Quiet, Daisuke. Our experienced chef, Saiga. You can talk to him about anything. But don't talk about anything naughty. We don't permit dating between workers. I am serious. It's banned. Managers and worker's can't date either, right? Of course. There is no such thing. Right? I will show you around the restaurant. This way. Hey, Manager! - She is cute. - Very cute. How are the things going with your boyfriend? - Nothing is new. - Yeah? Do you have a boyfriend? No, I don't. Are you an only child? Why? Do I look like that? I had a younger sister. - Let's start your therapy. - Yes. - Please take a seat here. - Yes. Isn't it good, doing it outside for a change? Yes. I feel good. I want to ask you one thing. What is it? - TOMIE - Do you know her? - No. I don't know her. - Okay. That's fine. There was one spot on the recording I couldn't hear. Okay-- It's summer vacation now, isn't it? Aren't you going back home? Isn't your mother waiting for you? What's wrong? I was very worried that I forgot everything from the accident. I feel like I had a best friend. But I don't remember anything. I see her face indistinctly in my dream. She has a mole here. But I don't remember her face at all. - TANABE - Wasn't he your classmate? Yes. Did I mention that? You said he was your boyfriend. After the accident, he broke up with me. I transferred schools, too. I feel like I lost everything because of the accident. My mother always had problems after the move. My mother-- She always works hard by herself. But I can't do anything for her. Let's stop the therapy for today. I think you shouldn't worry about the accident any more. You have a lot of things now. Photography, a boyfriend, and your mother. You have many things to do. But you only want to go back to the past. You want to go back the past, and you want to do it over again. But... there is nothing in the past. You only have your own annoying self. Do you understand what I said? In some ways. I have some things I want to do over again. What are they? It's a secret. I don't feel like going back. Thanks for coming. Who is the person you want me to see? A classmate of Izumisawa Tsukiko was killed. She is Dr. Hosono. Hello. He calmed down a little bit. But he is still talking nonsense. We want to talk to him alone. Could you leave the room? I will leave it to you then. Well-- Here he is. This is him. Here. This is him. I didn't think I would see you here. Mr. Yamamoto. He escaped the hospital last month. I am not sick. If you are not sick, what is this face?! He did this to himself. He went mad in the hospital and poured poison on himself. The diagnosis was that he is mentally deranged. But I don't think so. I didn't do anything. Let me out now. Please. Look. What is this ¥500? You know, you... were caught red-handed stealing this money. Let me out now! Mr. Yamamoto. What happened at your school? Can you tell us clearly? After all... You think he was crazy? Hmm. I can't say. Kawakami Tomie was killed, and her head was chopped off. But the head was alive under the ground. I don't think I can put that story in the record. Wasn't that a fantasy or an illusion? Doctor. Do you want to hear the truth? You see, I... I don't intend to solve the cases of Kawakami Tomie. Even if I keep investigating, there won't be any evidence. Because... I don't think... she is a human being. What do you mean? Kawakami Tomie has the same nature in each of the cases. She is terrifying and beautiful. Every man who meets her... becomes crazy about her and turns mad. And one of them always... will kill Tomie. But... even if they kill her... or cut her into pieces... she can revive from even one piece of her body. It's the only explanation for why we never find her body at the scenes. She is beyond the law. And... I only have one wish. I want to see Kawakami Tomie. I want to see her. Doctor. Could you wait for a second? Stop talking nonsense. I will sue you. You heard what I said. Kawakami Tomie is in this town. So what? What is her purpose? I don't know. It's Izumisawa Tsukiko! Tomie is trying to do something to her-- Manager! It's dangerous. What are you doing?! Who do you think you are?! You don't work at the restaurant. You are just following girls! I can't stand it any more! What are you saying?! What did I do? I'll kill you! You son of a bitch! Manager! I'm not kidding. I'll kill you! Hey, Daisuke! Daisuke! What are you doing?! Yuichi. I won't give her to you. What are you talking about?! Daisuke! I can't trust you. What's wrong with all of you? Welcome! Come on in. Yes? It's Kaori. What's up? Sorry I came by suddenly. You were developing pictures. Yeah. Did you hear? What? Nothing. It's nothing. Don't worry. What's wrong, Kaori? You are acting a little strange. I was thinking about going out. I came to ask you to come, but you seem busy. 'Bye. Yeah? Yeah. I am working now. What? We just saw each other the other day. What? I'm a little tired now. I'll call you back later. Hello? Hello? Say something! She was crying. Turn on the light. No. This is more romantic. Who was that? You are very popular, Mr. Saiga. Where is the manager? I don't know. He doesn't even take care of the store because of you. He is a pervert. He persists, even with that face. The manager is not the only one acting strange. Everyone-- Everyone? What happened? My feet hurt from standing all the time. Being a waitress doesn't suit me. You... What are you trying to do? What do you mean? I don't know! It's not my fault. Shut up! You messed everybody up! Who are you? What? Is that all? Listen, Saiga. You are seeing Izumisawa Tsukiko, aren't you? It's amazing. It's such a coincidence. She is... my friend. Didn't she tell you? Did you do something to Tsukiko? Tsukiko... What is so good about her? I like you, Saiga. Wow! These are the resumes of the workers. There are two more in that restaurant-- - Hey. - Yes? - Go downstairs. - Okay. That's horrible. - Could you look over there? - Yes. Who did you hear from? - He's in the fetal position. - What? The restaurant workers killed each other. There is one more part-time worker. We don't know where he is. YUICHI SAIGA NAOTO KADOKURAI TOMIE KAWAKAMI This is Hosono Clinic. Yes. Yes. Yes. Please hold a second. Doctor. Telephone call from the policeman, Harada. You can't do that. You can't go into another person's apartment. You are a bad girl. I have to punish you. MONSTER GIRL Tanabe! What are you doing?! Miss Izumisawa ? Are you home? Miss Izumisawa? Miss Izumisawa ? Tomie. Are you awake? Tsukiko? I wanted to see you Tsukiko. I finally saw you... but you don't remember me at all. I was very upset. Do you remember this? MONSTER GIRL You scattered this picture all over the school. You remember new, don't you? What... a "Monster"? You did a terrible thing to me, Tsukiko. What did you do to the doctor? I don't know. Why don't you ask Saiga? None of my business. Fuck you! What did you do? The way you talk! Nostalgic. You haven't changed, Tsukiko. I am very happy. - We will bring out the body! - Okay. Let's check inside the bag of Izumisawa Tsukiko. I heard you want to be a photographer. That's cool. You are 20 years old now? You are two years older than me. Everyone gets old like that. What is this? Tomie, stop it. What is this picture? Are you sure you have talent? You will marry a worthless man someday... and you will have stupid kids. You will be a grandma with wrinkles soon. Must be nice. That's the happiness of being a woman, isn't it? But I am a monster. I will be pretty forever. Don't you feel sorry? I'm sorry, Tsukiko. I stole the man you love again. Besides me... he was playing around with Kaori. You didn't know? You are so easy to fool, as always, Tsukiko. You know, men... are all worthless animals. Isn't it time you realized that? I want you to... remember me. We were best friends. Do you think about how much it hurt when you called me a "Monster"?! You don't remember anything?! I can't forgive you. Here is your dinner. Let's take pictures together. We haven't taken pictures together, have we? Hey, smile. I have something I have to tell you. Look at that. Call the identification section now. - Check outside. - Yes, - There is one more here. - Okay. I missed you again. Why are you running away from me? You can't forget about me. We... are friends, aren't we? Are you kidding me? I want you to disappear forever! I'm sad. I'm sad. I wanted to see you. Stop it! Stop it now! That's enough! I know... I was happy when I saw you killed. We aren't friends. I hated you all the time. I am not your friend! Please stop doing this. Please stop doing this. Please. To tell you the truth... I have something I have to tell you. What? What do you want to tell me? Something you forgot... Something very important... What is it? I am you. You are me. You don't remember that either? Bye-bye, Tomie. Okay. Good.
