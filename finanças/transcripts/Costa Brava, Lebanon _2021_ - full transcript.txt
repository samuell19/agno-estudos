Lebanon, in a near future. Statue is attached to the truck. We're leaving the port now. BUILDING FOR SALE Motherfuckers! Fuck you! The government announced new health measures in the capital to solve the garbage crisis, one of the many crises Lebanon faces. There is still no sustainable solution to reduce air pollution. The protests are continuing today. Beirut has become a living hell. People are struggling to escape their harsh reality. BADRI FAMILY - PRIVATE PROPERTY 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8... 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8... Gone. Reem, why did you wake up so early? I saw strangers in the valley. But I made them disappear. Move away. Careful. Reem! You want to go to a real school? - Stay, stay. - Ok. Yes. - Good. - Ok. Very good. Why are the leaves so yellow? This one has dried up too. I'll get water. Dad, look! The strangers are back! 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8... Excuse me! Excuse me! What are you doing? - Shoot them! - Enough, Reem! Shut up! - Mr. Badri! - What's going on? Mr. Badri! Excuse me! I tried to call. Your landline doesn't seem to work. Please, keep it civilized. The president is coming. Better to put your weapon away... Can you explain what's going on? Didn't you hear the news? - No... - The new MRF landfill. - An illegal dump you mean? - Not at all. It's legal, ecological, all that. We're doing it right this time. Here, really? You want to ruin the country's last green spot? It's not random. Serious studies led us here. And who's the pretty boy you craned in? You don't recognize your president? No! I forgot what he looks like. Wait... Are you Soraya Marwan? No, I'm not Soraya Marwan. You are! I grew up listening to your music. Swell! I love you! I love your music. The land belongs to my sister, Alia Badri. Actually, it doesn't anymore. I have the documents to prove it. We're trying to do good, and you can contribute. - She sold the land? - I have no idea. I can see by your flag there that you still have hope for the country. I flushed hope down the toilet ages ago. Reem! Stop. Mom! Call your demented daughter. I will. Calm down. Happy now? To screw us over? Why didn't you mention they annexed the land? You're the one who's gone mad! Walid, stop! Sure, we'll leave everything we built and grab the first plane to you. I can't let him pee in the woods! This way. Where are you going? - Mom? - He can use my bathroom. Sorry about my son. He's a bit eccentric. Go on in. Behind the white door to the left. Invite him to our bedroom next. He needs to go. Where are your manners? - Hi. - Welcome. How are you? I'm good. Wait for your buddy there. You'll find what you need inside. This is for you. If we can help you in any way... Do I look like I accept bribes? I'm telling you this for your own good. - You want to protect your kids... - Fuck you! Do you think I enjoy this? You're all sheep. Sheep. Our country will now be clean. We've found solutions to the problems we inherited. This project will follow international health and environmental guidelines. It is a gift from France, a long-time friend of Lebanon. This project is comprised of a recycling facility and a landfill. We will now recycle 80% of our garbage. And we will bury only 20%. The era of dumping and burning all of our trash is behind us. Congratulations! Hello! Finally, some humans! What is she doing? Mom! Mom! Come back inside! Did you really see me? How did I look? It's a show to reassure people. They'll take the money and run. What if they don't leave? They'll fuck up, and we'll have grounds to sue. I could ask Elie to take the case. He owes me one. I'll call Ghady. What does Ghady have to do with it? I miss you too, a lot. I'm ok. When will you come visit? I make exceptional olive oil now. Yes. Tell me. Did you watch the news? He's right here, where else? I'll put you on speaker. What do I care? My dad knows the project managers. The elections are in 2 months. It's a PR stunt. Told you so. I think they'll work for a short while then stop. Either way, come see us soon, ok? If I do, I fear your husband might die of joy. What? But I'm crazy about you! Yeah right. You could come see us. You keep missing my birthdays. Tell me, how bad is the situation there? It's shitty. Makes me nauseous. Unless it's my drinking or the rotten food. But I refuse to buy Norwegian parsley. - Come buy from us. - Sure! I'm on my way. - Alright, bye. - Bye, sweetie. What? I said I was crazy about him. What is it? - Pinkish red? - It has 8 muscles. And animals have it? It's soft. - A piece of meat? - It's wet. You're on the right track. Wet? When does it become wet? When you drink water. When you drink water? The tongue! Bravo! How could I know it had eight muscles? Reem, you eat like a pig. Can she eat like a human? Leave her alone. She's free. She's embarrassing us in front of the president. Don't worry, we'll send him back to his pals in Beirut soon. How? If they don't stop, they'll soon do illegal things. And we'll sue their asses off our land. Meanwhile... Passive resistance. Exactly. Resist passively all you want. I'm waiting for Alia to send my visa for Colombia. I'll be tanning. You resist. Slow down. Don't eat so fast. Look who's talking! You just ate four plates. Yes, but not quickly. Eating four eggs is bad for your cholesterol. At least she's eating. Fast or slow, this food has no taste. Everything is bad for his heart. Salt, people, even his own mother! Will you ever stop that? Open your mouth! Missed! Window. Light. Beirut. Rats. Mom. Dad. River. Dad. You fell asleep. All right then. Sweet dreams. You startled me, Walid! I know. You're anxious. Aren't you? Where will we run away to this time? You, yes. You, no. You, yes. You, no. You, no. You, no. Move away. 1, 2, 3... Good. Come on, faster! Good. Don't hold your breath underwater. You saw how Reem did it. Go on, faster. Good, great. Walid, that's enough for today. Much better. Hello Mr. Badri. Boys, get to it. Stop wasting time. Is the music bothering you? No. Not at all! Nice! Reem! Go, Soraya! Turn off that shitty music! As if we needed more garbage! You're hurting our ears! Ok, Mr. Badri. Fucking trash... Three streets were emptied of garbage today. Does it feel like the end of the... The end of the crisis? They'll find new ways to kill us. Who are you kidding? Hey! Pretty boy! - Got a cigarette? - Only local ones, ok? Whatever, I just want a drag. Grandma! Grandma! She shouldn't smoke. Come on, I should be dead by now. What's your wi-fi? I wish. There's no internet in this valley. No way! There's phone internet. But it's slower than me on Xanax. Her dad is quite eccentric. Her mom too, but her dad even more so. I can't get any signal. If I tell you where to stand, will you get me a pack? Of cigarettes? - Yes please. - Sure! I will. Abdo! Don't you have work? Yes, sorry. Sorry ma'am. No worries. Hi. - Hello. - How are you? - Can we have a little talk? - Yes. What's your name? Tala. Tala. Nice to meet you. Pretty name. You're pretty too. No, I'm not. You are. You look like your mom. Do you listen to her music? Maybe you're too young for it? I'm 17 going on 18. Oh! I thought you were even older. Listen, I have this paper... - Reem! - No, no, no. I'm innocent. Remove them from here! What's wrong? Did you fight? All good. What could be wrong? Business as usual. Reem! Tala! Put on these gloves. You take the small one, I want the bulldozer. Tala, come on! People are burnt out. Shame on them! Their downfall is imminent. Aren't we drinking the same water? Who still believes their lies? Protesters have blocked roads with burning tires and... Mom! Mom! Come down. What did you do now? Come and see. They'll fix them. What good will it do? It will slow them down! The machines won't start. Yeah... but I didn't want to do it. Don't worry! I have it under control. Turn around. - Tala! - Reem! Tala, Reem! They don't seem to be preparing the land. No. Not at all. Yes, I still have my cameras. 25, 26... 27, 28... If I install eight traps, no Super Rat will enter. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Didn't we say no more counting? I won't let anyone eat my brain. Who told you this nonsense? Dad. In Beirut, a kid woke up with a rat eating his ear. It almost reached his eye. Your father! Reem, these are stories your dad made up. You're old enough to know. I'm not taking any risks! Come here! Give me the helmet! Reem! Reem! The vegetables look sick. Maybe you over-watered them. Did you try eggshells? Can you stop filling her head with horror stories? Won't she be terrified when we go back to Beirut? Oh! You want to go back now? Look around! Can't you see what's happening? So, we're back to short-term thinking? So, we're back to being patronizing? You're in a bad mood. I'll give you some space. What will we do when it gets worse? We've been isolated here for eight years. Who knows? Beirut might get better. Beirut will never change. Even if an army bleached its streets for years. - Must I count the times... - No please! Enough with the counting. We agreed to leave when unhappy. Aren't we happy here? Aren't you happy? What about your mom? The doctors gave her a year to live before we moved here. I feel selfish. Like those people I hate. If we leave, they'll destroy the whole area. Taking their bribe and running would be selfish. What would we be teaching the girls? Easy for you to say. - We're fortunate... - Fortunate? How are we fortunate? All we have is this home. It was blood and sweat to fix it. Attack! Raise your weapons! Tell us again how you met. Ew, no! It's disgusting! Stop it! Please! Don't you want to know how we met? - A little bit. - Ok. - I'll tell half the story. - Ok. We had gathered after a big protest. I had sung at the protest and your dad was there. - You sang at the protest? - Yes. And your dad was there. As usual, it got violent, your dad got beaten up by the police. As usual. His legs were both injured. We all gathered after the protest. I didn't know him well. We were drinking and I accidentally spilt whisky on his legs. It stung because of his wounds. It's ok. Chlorine disinfects. You mean whisky disinfects? Yes! Chlorine. Alcohol you mean! So, he was in deep pain. He was jumping and screaming. And he yelled at me. At first, I felt guilty. But he screamed so loud I started laughing. He started laughing too. He calmed down. We drank. We ended up talking all night long. We got drunk. And then... You and Tala came along. How did you know you loved him if you were drunk? Ew, stop! Because when I sobered up, I was still in love with him. Did you stop singing because of him? No. Not because of him. There were many reasons. We had so many beautiful dreams. We had so much hope. We dreamt of changing the world. But we lost everything. They really wore us out. What's wrong? Nothing. There's nothing. No, they're dumping the garbage as is. Yes, like they always do. The foreign investors need to see it. Reem. Soon, we'll grow a third eye. Kids will be born with four arms. And we'll all die of cholera. Dad, Mom, you, me. We'll all die of cholera. Zeina, enough already. It's all going to be ok... It's all going to be ok... I don't like this. Will you tell on me? No. Are those what Dad wrote for? He wrote for newspapers, not magazines. Is that how Beirut is now? No, this is not Beirut, it's New York. In Beirut, buildings aren't this tall. And they're colorful. Bless you! You got me the smartphone? Smartest phone in the country! - Admire its beauty. - Here's my ring. Looks like you set up wi-fi. Finally! Look! The antenna is 3m 25cm. Oh please! Tell me all about the 25cm! You are so funny. - Can I look Mom up? - Sure, type away. Soraya Marwan What are you doing? Nothing. I bought a smartphone from Abdo. Is that a crime? Since when do you like that crap? Don't be so hard on her. When you were her age, did you listen to me? She's educated and free. No need for that. Free? You're such a fascist. Don't mind the garbage, worry about the phone. What's wrong? My mom is buying phones from the neighbors. No big deal, it's just a phone. Is he very mad? He's just anxious. It'll pass. Can I borrow one of your old songbooks you wrote in? Can I read any of them? Of course. Dear Beirut... I bruise as easily as you do We're both anemic veins And unbrushed hair And survivor's guilt And a fleeting pulse - Put them here. - Here? - They're heavy. - It's ok. - They moved the fence? - We'll move it back. Oh wow! We'll move it back. That won't stop them. It will soon reach our bedroom. Tomorrow I'll expedite the lawsuit. You? Going to Beirut? - I can go. - Don't worry. I'll go. I'll go. Stop it. I said I'll go. Don't go. What if it explodes? Everything will be fine. Working at night, you fuckers? Fuck this shit! Alia is on her lunch break! Hello, sunshine. - How are you, Mom? - Fine, honey. Why did you cut your hair? Longer is nicer. I have a meeting in 5 minutes. Are you ok? I saw the Beirut protests have grown. Now she cares about Beirut. Beirut, I don't know. But it's wonderful here. The trees dance. The birds sing. The air is clean. When will you get me that visa? I'd love to live a little before I go. I'll get it Mom, no one will die. But what will you do now? Can't his wife convince him? His wife is right here. Here's Soraya. Hi Soussou! Wow! The whole family is here. - How are you? - Good, sweetie. And you? I'm good. And here's your brother. Hi bro. Smile! My colleagues will think you're in a terrorist group. Smile less. My daughters will think you're a nice person. Haven't I gone far enough from you? Stop this now. Grow up! Grandma, what are you doing? Attempting suicide? Got a death wish? You're making her live in a landfill. You sold the land to trash mongers! Walid, don't start! - They expropriated. I got nothing! - Don't you start! You knew she was smoking? - Yes, I knew. - And you let her? Sometimes it's nice to let people be, no? Wow! You're so wise now, Soussou! - You gave me a migraine. - At least I gave you something. Nice to see you. Gotta go. Thank you for the time travel. Bye Mom. It's all going to be ok. It's all going to be ok... This is where we need this motherfucking mask. Why don't you come with me? Think I should? Next time. It's too short notice. My hair looks like a broom. Keep an eye on everything, ok? Filter, oil, pesticides and jam. Breathe in, breathe out. See the lawyer and come right back. Don't forget to help Reem with the pool filter, ok? Ok, for the 20th time. Rage on the streets, as protests spread from Beirut to other regions over the financial and environmental crisis. We ask a young protester why she came. To claim my rights... It's all going to be ok, it's all going to be ok... - You start. I'll count. - Ok. I'll start. Faster, faster, faster! - Two! - Faster. Five! Faster. Faster! Last one! Tala! Isn't that boy cute? When I was your age, I thought about sex all the time. Enough! Why enough? Sex is life! How much sex did you have, to miss it so much? Just with your grandfather, unfortunately. There were no other men? There were some. But it didn't work out. So I married your grandpa. There was one I was crazy about... but it wasn't meant to be. And life passed while I was waiting. Hello Mrs. Zeina! Mom, come! We need to clean the filter. Come on! It's 1pm already! Ok, relax. I'll come in a bit. Thank you so much. How nice of you! I am good for nothing. I am good for nothing. I have no right to feel I am good for nothing. Strange! No matter how hard I try, I cannot remember the color of people's eyes. But Walid, well... Your eyes are blue, so blue. Tala, my tiny one born at the most toxic time. I held you on my chest and my life changed. Beirut. I don't mean to be silent. I'm just trying not to cry. How did we get here? My eyes will adjust to darkness. Beirut, I'll leave for a while. But when I return, it will be summer, scorching sun and music everywhere. You'll ask me, what took you so long? And I'll tell you where I've been... Why are you making weird sounds? Get away from me, Reem! Get out! Open the door! I'll tell Dad you locked me out! Shush Reem, what are you doing? Sisters don't tell on each other. - Go sleep with your grandma. Leave her. - I don't want to. I said go sleep with your grandma. Hurry up! I accept, but only this once. Thank God! Tala? Do you need to talk? I'm here in case you change your mind. Grandma is snoring. Try turning her on her side. I think she doesn't want me there, and I must sleep in my room with Tala. Come here. You can sleep here. Tala needs space, but she loves you. Then why did she do that? Because she's changing. She's growing up. Why would she change if she grows up? It would be boring if people stayed the same, no? Activists are targeting illegal environmental projects. They set up tents in the valley to sleep there, hoping to halt the destruction of the natural reserve. Can you turn the music off? I was told not to listen to shitty music. If you like my music this shitty project is not for you. Why are you still awake? Why are you still here? I'm guarding. Guarding what? The trash? I'm making sure no one tampers with our engines. Poor you. I like the silence here. Oh, you do? You're welcome. Make yourself at home. Which one did you kill? Your mom. You're back! Are you drunk? Maybe. Want to get drunk with me? Don't you want to know what happened? Photos and videos won't change a thing. You know that. I know. But the international community is watching. And people are protesting. Don't be naive. Protests never changed anything. You saw them? Did you pass by our old house? Is our fig tree still there? Or did they rip it out? I didn't go to Beirut. You didn't go to Beirut? I told Elie to meet me at the gas station. I'm not in the mood. Who told you I was in the mood? One thing I asked from you... Walid, please! I didn't think... Of course not, I think for you. Otherwise, we'd all be drowning in shit. Just like our pool. Yes. It's always my fault. I hate it when you leave while we're talking. Sometimes I lose count of all the things you hate. I reminded her five times. Who did he pick to clean the filter, you or me? It's not my fault if I'm better at mechanics. This is garbage! Count to 44 and you won't die. - Eight. - Bravo. Careful, mouse. Tala! Tala! Why aren't you answering? Reem! Finish your plate. Eat. There's no going outside. I want to go outside. I want to go out... I want to go out... Reem! I said come here. Sit and finish your plate! A green landfill, my ass. Tala! Hurry up. Come on! Now! You can't go out without a mask. Come here! There's no going outside. No! Can she listen to me for once? Reem, your mom is right. Hello, they are burning the trash. Yes. I documented everything. What? What's wrong? Walid! He will call back... Did you see this? Can I go out? I'll wear the mask. No. She has a fever. Good. I'll go faster. I'm done with these flying rats. Are you shooting birds now? Garbage birds. I don't want to see them here. I don't need any more madness. - Where are you going? - To hell. You told us not to go outside! May I never come back! Can I remove the mask? There's no more smoke. Say sorry to Mom. This is what I do with Tala. It always works. It takes more time to solve adults' problems. Then, why didn't you start solving them earlier? Show me our old house in Beirut. We can't see it from here. It's too far. Do you miss it? Yes. But if I had stayed there, I'd have gone mad. Also, Tala almost died of pneumonia there. And you almost died in the explosion. Walid? What are you doing? What are you doing, Walid? How will this help? Walid! - Give me this! - Leave me alone! At least he's doing something! Tala, what are you doing? Walid! Walid, come here! I'm talking to you! You're just like your father, it's heartbreaking. What did you say? You think I like saying it? For years, you watched him be a dick. Stay silent now, it's better. If I stay here, I'll kill you. I don't know what I'll do to you! If you don't like it, leave. Ok, then. Mom! Mom, please eat to take your meds. Please. I don't get it, why did they cut the power? I'm ready, my Lord... Ready for what? Mouse. It's time for Grandma to go party elsewhere. 1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10... 1,2,3,4,5,6... Stop counting, Mouse. You know what happens if I stop. Stop taking life so seriously. - You want me to let you die? - Yes. Really? Yes. Ok... 1,2, 3,4... Reem! Alia! You hold your cigarette like Grandma. I'll poke you eight times. Why aren't you there? Because you're little? Of course not, I'm not little. I know that in the end, we'll all die. But I worry grandma is upset at me. Why? I killed her. You killed her? How? I stopped counting at 43 instead of 44, No! Only because she asked. Oh, if she asked, you're fine. Mom knew what she wanted. But maybe she didn't really know. She was sick and half asleep. You get me? There's trash in Colombia? Yes. But not where I am. I live by the sea. Ah yes! Is it where you exploit poor regions for the benefit of multinationals? - Take my suitcase. - Do it yourself! May God be with you. May God be with you. How sad that you're back and the country is in such a mess. How long are you staying? Only two days. Can't you stay a bit longer? No. What were Mom's last words? "Stop taking life so seriously." The lawsuit was denied. We saw it coming. What did you expect? How were we going to pay for it? Our savings are dried up. I had to try... Walid, let's leave. Let's go back! We can't run away forever. Go back where? Where? Go with Alia to Colombia. And tell us how much you love Lebanon on social media. You should decide whether you love or hate this country. She wore this at your parents' wedding. I hate weddings, but that one was special. Good night, ladies. Come here. Come. Try it on. Go ahead! Why don't you come visit more often? It's hard to take time off. Don't you get vacation days? I do. You look like an old lady. Doesn't this door have a lock? We have nothing to hide. A gift for the little monkey. I'm allergic to seashells. Then wear it, don't eat it. Do you have a boyfriend in Colombia? Not right now. I get bored easily. Dad says that you don't know what you want. Because I don't want what he wants. You get me? What about you? Tala, hey! How are you? Are you feeling better? I'm ok. Want half a chicken sandwich? I was eating. No, thanks. Coffee or anything? No, thanks. Do you want to talk about it? No, thanks. Phew, I suck at this. Can I come in? Sure, if you want to. What did you study at college? Environmental engineering. Was it fun? Well, college isn't much fun. But I met my friends there. You seem to have many friends. Because it's no fun to drink alone. Your eyes are so brown. Thank you. Tala! What? I don't know. What's wrong? What? I don't know. It's awkward for you to do that. This is so nice! But, why? Well... But I'm 17, going on 18. It's just not worth it... Do you know what I mean? - You... - Mr. Badri, calm down! Walid! You're mad! You've completely lost it. Leave me alone! No, you leave me alone. Leave us all alone. You're crazy. Look at her... Shut up! Shut up already! Enough! I'm trying to protect... She's still young. Who asked you to protect her? Who asked you to protect us anyway? Let us be. You've trapped us... Enough. We're rotting here! I'm rotting here! I miss my life, I miss my work. I miss people, I miss protests. Shit is what you miss! I miss our old life. Do you remember any of it? Are you done? No, I'm not done. No. I'm not done! Oh, wow! I'm not done! In 44 seconds, they will stop. Stop it, please! - Stop! Enough! - Leave me alone! My heart will burst, please! Maybe it should, once and for all! Thugs! Corrupt thugs! Are you leaving? We were told to halt construction. The foreign investors pulled out. - When will you remove the trash? - No clue. The machines are expensive. Protesters might damage them. Where's Tarek? Tarek called in sick. We hope to resume the works when things settle down. I really like you. Especially Mrs. Zeina. Such a kind heart. What can I say? - Goodbye and sorry. - Leave! As you wish! We'll leave, lovely little lady. I'm leaving. - I don't want to. - Reem, pack your bags! What are you doing? I'm not leaving! Reem, stop it! You idiot! I'll come back soon to get you. Back off! You'll take care of your dad? Oh, you care about him now? Tala! Tala! 1, 2, 3... You need to eat something. Maybe we should go to Beirut? Give it a few days. All these people will return home. Even Mom. I was like them all my life.
