To watch the bustle of life, is always amusing. And it is fun, when one likes people. Yet, one has to look at things from a proper height. Not too high, though, like astronauts because for their weightlessness, they don't even have the time to notice what's really going on. A humble height and a humble tower dwarfing a humble small town will do, and one sees tragedies as well as trilogies. Now, I'll have a look what's the day like today at home. We should see five baby prams there. Oh no, six already. We are growing uncontrollably and there's nothing we can do about it. These are tourists from remote cooperative farms. They're always keen on coming here, especially during harvest, to admire our Renaissance gables and dispraise our good beer. And this is our biggest expert on traffic. Watch him carefully, how he manages a car crash. Lucky for us that people don't listen to him. Look, Frank Timber, or Frank Tube, depending on what odd job he's doing. Susan, she'd be drawing all day. The little one is trying hard too. Hettie, do you hear me? Why are you drawing only with a blue chalk? That's the only one I've got, uncle. Well, why not, even Picasso had his blue period. Ah, hopping gossip. She always hops, when she's window peeking. She'd like to see that, those two are not married, you see, but she'd surely want them to be. That's her flat. The innkeepers are celebrating. But it can't be anything big, as they are drinking from small snifters. Unless it's an auditor from the district or even the regional office? They'd have bigger snifters, though. And this is little Joey with his dad Jack, who keep's telling everyone that he has arthritis. But he really suffers from thirst. Frank is carrying bricks. And they're still auditing over here. Well I ever! Jack is working? Isn't he ill? No, he isn't, he's collapsing and healthy as usual. And Marianne will help him, she's so kind. That's the mother of the girl with the blue chalk. I don't know, whether she's a widow or a single mother, after all, let's not be formalists. What a Jack-ass! This is a Jack-ass too, even if his name is Robert. - I don't know, what he sees on her. - Are you sure? Oh my, if you didn't, just say so. There's still time. I was right, it's from the regional office, they have a black 603 saloon. The accounts were in order, and the snifters likewise. Yes, this is for the driver. And the show is over. They'll take him home, he'll get better and he'll go to the pub on his own. Frank again? What's that on his neck? Some medal, outlandish I'd say. Hullo. If they don't set a job limit for him, he'll work himself to death. I can't watch this. At first, it seems like an operetta, but if Robert doesn't come to senses, he'll end up in a tragedy. Will you always love me, till you die? - I have to go home for breakfast. - No... - Isn't that remarkable. - What a shot, mum? - Murderer! - Me and a murderer? You fool. What is it good for? Shooting storks is forbidden. I know, but I have a special permit, you see. Just you wait, when we tart it up. She knows that we're not doing it for ourselves. Can anyone tell me, what is our town famous for? - For our museum of stuffed animals. - And tell me, teacher and you all, what would our town be without our stuffed museum? - We wouldn't have any waxworks. - You ought to realize that a perfectly stuffed animal is the best learning tool. Learning from corpses, well? I didn't mean you. And that no live animal is not as alive, as an animal - alive before and stuffed after. - You are murderers anyway. They dislike spread wings. We're lucky we don't have any. Listen, Mr. Oliva, with this sack you can speak only for yourself, - understand? For yourself only. - And that takes some doing. Go about your business, everyone. Just a minute, I'm a bit late. Hullo. And something for you too, Johnny. There you are. Good day. - That line must be repaired. - I see it too. I'll fix it. - Wait. Clean it, comrade. - Of course. It'll be shining... Olda, can't you be... when... - Well, well. - So... Good day. Isn't that boy of mine stupid? Nonsense. Your son is a clever boy. Nevertheless, he requires care. Care is not an easy thing, when one's a widower. And even more, if Robert is his teacher. Listen, Robert, denoting your superior as a murderer in public doesn't seem like constructive criticism. - Or does it? - Well... You see, it doesn't. Besides, I've never given up the idea of bringing you on the right path. Which is only one, as the truth, eh? - Especially if it's your truth. - My truth? What do you mean by that? That everyone has his own truth? What kind of an idea is that, young man. Caution! Excuse me, comrade. Of course. To the right, comrade. - I beg your pardon? - I said to the right. Oh, to the right. We always say that the nicest thing in the world is what? Joey? - Friendship. - And what else, Hettie? - Sincerity. - Yes, and what else, Olda? - Not to cower to anyone. - Not to cower to anyone, yes. And all together it means to be a good citizen of our town. Now, everyone will write, draw or paint what he or she likes or dislikes in our town, or what would he or she like to be better here. Come on, everyone. I know you're watching me, but what am I supposed to do? I needed money for the car and now for fuel and for mummy too. If I give to the guests what they deserve and not to the state, they'll put me in jail. If I give to the state what belongs - to it and give less to tourists... - They'll put you in jail all the same. At school, we were saying that the nicest thing in the world is sincerity and friendship. But some people don't tell the truth... I don't like my daddy, but I won't write that down, because he would whip me. As the question is not in line with our requirements, it is essential to pay heed to the moral aspect of the matter. The moral aspect of the matter..., have you got that? As the question of our requirements... Come in! Is not in line, it is... Oh, Julie, diligent as always. Charlie, close your eyes. Don't be foolish, Rosie. Why, that's wonderful, excellent, it's absolutely perfect. - You're an artist, comrade. - You set your shoulder to the wheel. No, I just did the technical part. The sculptural part is the work - of our headmaster. - As you wish, everyone according to one's skills. Fly around. - I beg your pardon? - Fly, so that the illusion is perfect. - You mean like that? - Precisely. Children, today we will paint reality. Comrade Oliva will be our model. If you want... I can tell you some stories. About how you fell in love. About your sailor days and how you were shipwrecked. So about love and peril. Why not. Those are two things that make a hero from an ordinary fellow. And I wanted to be a hero back then. I was still young and handsome, I'm not young any more, only handsome. - Why didn't you laugh, Helen? - You are handsome, uncle. Thank you, my dear. And don't call me uncle. I used to be the second steersman on one Greek ship. We set to sea on a beautiful day. Everything was just fine and only when we were passing the Cape of No Hope, it used to be called the Cape of No Hope, you see, and today it's the Cape of Good Hope, everything is getting better. So, as we were passing that cape, all of a sudden we got into a storm. The storm lasted 3 days and 3 nights! The storm did all it could, the ship did all it could, I did all I could, but the captain knew nothing, we ran into a cliff and got shipwrecked. On the next day, I woke up on a sandy beach, not knowing how I got there. Not a soul around me, but for crates and wrecks and a small town nearby. I set off towards it and when I got there, what do you think, there wasn't a soul in the streets or in the houses, not a soul in the gardens, it was a deserted. And only from afar, as if brought by the breeze - I heard music. Enchanting music, like from a magic flute. Do you hear it? So, I followed the sound of music and it led me to a small square, where all the people from the town were gathered and were listening to a magician playing a magic flute. And a girl came with the magician, so charming, I've never seen such a beautiful girl in my life, and I was much looking around. Her name was Diana. And as this Diana was dancing and singing so beautifully, a cat was walking around her, and the cat had something that no cat in the world has. - Small eye glasses! - Really, uncle... Mr. Oliva. I still have them. Here they are. I won't give them to you. No, go to your chairs, sit down. The glasses are the only thing that reminds me of Diana. Who in my eyes then embodied all the beauty of the world and an ocean of mystery. - What happened to me instantly, then? - You fell in love. And how! I travelled with them from village to village, from town to town, I joined their show and did everything, but for one thing that I was not allowed to do: to take off the cat's glasses. - And why? - I asked the same thing. But they never ever told me. Bless my eyes, lassie, you're a dab hand with it. It's a rare sight. You know you could go to a circus with this as a speedpainter? Where was I? So, they never ever told me. Until one hot morning Diana fell asleep under a mulberry in blossom. And when someone falls asleep under a mulberry, he has to tell the truth. That's an old proverb, Arabian or..., well from the Near East. So when Diana fell asleep under that mulberry, I asked her: "Diana sleeping under the mulberry, why can't I take off the cat's glasses?" "Because," said Diana still sleeping under the mulberry, "if the cat didn't have the glasses everyone would change colour according to their nature and actions." And people wouldn't like that. So, I was waiting for the nearest show and at the height of it, I took the cat's glasses. And it was just as Diana had said. People started changing colour according to their nature and actions. Some were purple... - And who? - Liars and Pharisees. - The unfaithful turned yellow. - Yes, yellow as brimstone - and egg yolk, as canaries. - It served them right. And most importantly, Hettie, lovers turned red, as red poppy. - What about normal people? - What happened to them? Well, the greatest trouble is always with normal people. They didn't gain or lose anything, but it was some scrimmage. Because the purple and grey people, didn't want the others to know, so they were bad and killed the cat. - And what about Diana? - Diana disappeared and all there's left are the glasses. I know you, you're you and he's him! Don't let those who paint lose their hope. What do you think you're doing from my school? You're insane! - And what's that wanderer doing there? - Comrade Oliva..., we have an arts and crafts lesson, he's our model. I can see that. And fooling around like a clown! - He's arousing fantasy in the children. - Non-scientific. No other exists for me. Does not exist... Tabby! Pussy cat! - Pussy! - Come on, don't be foolish. Here, pussy, pussy. Pussy, pussy! Nothing? Oh, well. Pussy, pussy! Pussy cat! Does it hurt? Come. Pussy, Tabby. - Sit down. - Thank you. Isn't it hot? - Does it hurt? - No. You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. At least I think so. - We bumped his head. - Oh, it happens. - As chance would have it. - I'm pleased... - That I have a bump? - No, to meet you. - You're just like our castellan. - Like who? The castellan. He looks like you, speaks like you. His name is Oliva. Oliva... Do we know any Oliva? - Is he smart? - Just as you are. - Handsome, eh? - You should know, - if you're a magician. - I know nothing. I know only what I want to know. Would you like to know everything? - Well, if I were a magician. - What would you say to a cup - of black coffee? Refreshing, eh? - Yes. - We have costumes of all people. - Really? Of any person you wish. Who do you wish? Napoleon? - No, you can get it everywhere. - Chingiskhan? - No. - Columbus, then. No, I'd like something... less military, more common. - Like what? - Like me. This. There you are. With costumes, it's the same as with the infinity or finity of the universe. What universe would you prefer, a finite or infinite? - What do you think? - Well, I think a cup of coffee would be swell, what do you say to that? I've seated them perfectly. It will be difficult with Robert anyway. Come on, take some. Robert is so stubborn. And such a doughface at the same time. It's fitting, isn't it? Thank you. That was a good one. It was so stupid. If we can't make head or tail of it, it cannot be directed at anyone. And therefore, it's also typical. Just mere ribaldry. My poor fellow, it seems we aren't much different. Yellow is the colour of infidelity. A grey rose, rather strange. Beware, madam, grey is the colour of pilferers and thieves. And purple is for hypocrites, climbers, careerists, and liars. Red stands for true love. Red is for lovers. Yes, only the Middle Ages. You still look yourself, sir. Don't worry, we'll find Tabby. - Are you alright? - Tabby is gone. - That's life. - I'll kill it, kill it! You're waiting for me, you cuddly boy? What's the matter? Quiet! Tabby! Pussy, pussy! What's going on here? Is it a symposium of doubles, or matter and antimatter approximation, which I would not recommend, as it could lead to annihilation and thus, to the creation of an unknown power, and the known powers are just enough. Mr. Oliva, please, did you see Tabby? To lie or not to lie, that is the question, even if it's dark. - I did. - Where did he go? Well, I took him away in a sack, so they don't kill him. And I let him go right here, to make him stay a little longer. - He's needed here. - He's needed everywhere. Can you show us what have you got in your sack? As a magician, you ought to know that. - Forgive me for my distrust. - Never mind. We are used to distrust here. Wicked tongues say I eat cats. But I've got horse-meat there. Because I like goulash. - Good night. - Sweet dreams. You too. - G'night, double. - Apropos, - you don't remember me? - How could I forget, you were my alter ego. And you were in love with Diana. Wow, and how! And how come she doesn't know me? Youth has short memory. Only the aging keep reminiscing. She was beautiful, when young. What am I saying! She is beautiful and young! There's something wrong. Why? Youth does not age and beauty does not fade away. There's something to it. How long have you been doing this? Me? Well, since people needed it. A bit of beauty, a bit of magic, adding a little bit of Sunday to a grey working day. And what are you doing? I'm trying to cultivate children's fantasy. What a fragile flower. Withering with vanishing childhood. I'd call it something like a non-resistant annual flower. Well, I'm trying to cultivate a resistant perennial from it. - A michurinist, eh? - Hmm. It seems we're both tied up in work. - Apropos, double, g'night. - A very g'night. - Where is Tabby from anyway? - From our home. I see, from your home. And where is your home? Everywhere, where there are children, where's Oliva and where you are. - And people like you and Mr. Oliva. - I've seen you before, Diana, a long time ago, I was still climbing up the hill then. When you are young, it's like climbing up high mountains. You keep going up, but it doesn't matter, because the wind is blowing and the blue sky is above you, so blue that your heart aches. And when you want to touch it, it leaps back. Back then, when I was still climbing, I saw you. Many times, I don't know how come I didn't recognize you at once. - But you're still going up the hill. - As long as I'm with you. Or with the children. That's why I love teaching them. - Tabby! - Pussy, pussy cat! Tabby! - Don't leave, Diana. - I must. They're waiting for us. Find Tabby. I'll come back for him. Attention! Attention! This is a special announcement. A trained cat called Tabby is missing. The creature is the size of an adult cat, with greyish colour. As it is a trained animal, its value is significant. The finder shall receive a generous reward. Nothing can happen to me. Though I think that someone else will get into a tight corner, eh? - I don't give a damn about that cat. - I don't like cats, for their inherent falsehood. I don't like wanderers either. Whose conscience is clear doesn't have to be afraid. Miaow, miaow. What did the gents say? They saw that trained tom-cat in the field by the woods. Trained or not, in the field or in the woods, such a beast - is nothing else than a vermin. - One has a game licence - and doesn't even use it. - I'd love to have a shot. Your rifle is polished and shining. - So, this afternoon, eh? - This afternoon. - Who? - Me, of course. - What's the matter, sir? - The smell. What a terrible smell. Wait. Marianne! I have a terrible ache again. - Are you telling the truth? - I swear to God. Hullo, daddy. - Miaow! - Listen, Mr. Oliva, - you used to be funnier. - And you were not so grey then. - Why such a hurry? - I'm not in a hurry. Ah, you're not. But you are! We always hurry, if we are ashamed. Don't you knock? Bring Robert here. Tabby has been found, you see. Have Joey bring it here, I'd like to have a close look at that four-legged wizard. I can arrange that. I'm calling Joey to come with the cat to the headmaster's office. - Will you keep an eye on him? - Of course I will. He'll be better off with me until Diana comes for him. - Yeah, he'll play with Pussy. - He'll have a hell of a time. Go now and tell the kids I'll take care of Tabby. Don't worry. I'm coming. I'll be right there to see that little beast. - Wait, stay where you are! - Wait, let's talk. - I beg your pardon, that's betrayal! - Correct, it is betrayal. But your betrayal. You have betrayed your mission as a teacher. - I'm a good teacher! - Hush, sit down. You teach children to hatemonger peaceful citizens. That cat is your work. - The cat told the truth. - I'm not willing to discuss the cat. As you wish, but tell the school servant to return Tabby back to me! - Are you keen on teaching? - I am, otherwise, I wouldn't be here. Let me give you valuable advice, then. Stop bothering about the cat, don't look left or right, and teach. Else... I know everything, Robert. What will I tell the children? They gave Tabby to me to take care of him... - Being a rebel won't help. - I can't bend my back, Julie. Come on, tactics has nothing to do with your spine. Tactics, you've turned all purple from all those tactics. Only for you, Robert. Only for you. Be sensible. You want Tabby and you want to teach, - you must resort to compromise. - As you wish, I'm resorting. Don't make fun of it. A temporary compromise is possible. What compromise? What... This one. You know, how much the headmaster values it? - But we've talked about the stork. - You'll repeat the lesson, then. - In higher interests. - Such a mummy, ugh. Tabby for the stork, quid for quod. - I'll arrange everything else. - Julie... Is it true that Tabby isn't with you, sir? I gave it to Olda's father for a while. - My dad doesn't like him. - It only seems that way. Children, what bird is it, who knows? This bird is a stork. - Correct. - But we already had the stork. We did, but it's an important bird, we can repeat our lesson. - Hettie, what do you know about it? - The stork feeds on fish - and all sorts of pond animals. - Will we take Tabby back? Good day. Continue with your lesson, comrade. It seems my spine is bending. The stork. That's a rewarding topic. Headmaster, the class would like to know how a stork is stuffed. - Is he serious? - Is he serious? Pupils, stuffing or preparation of such a frog eater is not an easy task. It is an field of art... Look! The school servant is carrying Tabby in a cage. And he has a stocking on his head. Stuffing must be very interesting work, but we do not need it any more. We don't need to kill animals just to make learning tools of them. Isn't it much better to capture their life and beauty on film? Or on a photograph? Just look at this poor creature and its empty look. Or just imagine stuffed Tabby sitting here and gazing at us with glass eyes. You are insane, Robert. You must apologize. - You must apologize or else... - Or else what? - Or it's all over between us. - I agree. - With what? - With it all being all over. - But, Robert... - It will be better that way, Julie. Our spines would not fit each other. That's interesting, it seems like an ordinary cat at first sight, - while... - It's such a beast, eh? Keep an eye on that anarchist. - And as I ordered... - Not to worry, everything is ready. I can begin right now. I've just had an idea, as long as we have him in our hands, anything can happen to such cat, he can eat something terrible - for example, or... - Tell the innkeeper and Jack to come to my office before midnight. I understand. I summoned you all to discuss the cat matter. It's a rather delicate matter. And I advise you that as an official I do not intend to influence anyone, as I am not for or against anyone. My only wish is to prevent the recurrence of the scandalous scenes in our town and the dishonour of law abiding citizens. - Rip it to pieces. - Let us be civilized, my friend. Civilized. No one will steal the cat. I've prepared everything. - Continue. - I'd rip it to pieces. And what if someone steals the cat? I mean supposedly. For example the servant here will go to the basement tomorrow and he'll see that the cage is empty, the window's broken and everybody suspects Robert, - while the cat... - ... is slowly dying. What do you think? Well, I'm not deciding anything, I'm merely conducting the meeting. Alright, but someone must make the decision, eh? You've sank to the bottom, young man. Tell me, can such a person teach our children? That's out of the question. I mean well, Robert, find another job or else... One more to the ground! Hullo... Take everything and destroy it! WE LIKE OUR TEACHER AND TABBY. BECAUSE WRONG IS BEING DONE TO THEM, WEARE LEAVING. Attention! Attention! Third grade pupils are ordered Attention! Attention! Third grade pupils are ordered to return to their homes. I repeat. Third grade pupils are ordered to immediately return to their homes. If only they knew what I know. Attention! Attention! Third grade pupils are ordered to return to their homes. I repeat. Third grade pupils are ordered to immediately return to their homes. Vinnie! - Children! - Olda! - Jaruna! - Olda! Do you hear me? Joey! Olda! - Children! - Come back, kids! - Children! - Olda! Joseph! - Joey! - Blazenka! - Svatopluk! - Tony! Everybody follow me! Forward! Leftists to the left, rightists to the right. Peter! Peter! Pete! Tony! - Stop yelling. - Peter! Pete! - Go that way, I'll go this way. - Peter! Mum! Mum! - Francis! - Francis! - Mary! - Mary! - Dusan! - Dusan! Peter, please! - Peter! - Peter! Peter, Pete! Attention! Attention! Third grade pupils are ordered to return to their homes. I repeat. Third grade pupils are ordered to immediately return to their homes. As if we didn't have enough trouble. They've searched everywhere, but the kids have vanished into thin air. That's why they're trying on their own now with hats in their hand. Joey, if you don't show yourself - don't get into my sight. - Hettie, do you hear me? Fun is over, it's time to go home, or else you'll see. Do you hear me? Calm down, please, it's just plain roguery. After dark, the children will become afraid and come home cap in hand. Mom. Peter, what have you done to us, you poor child? Mom, mom. - What misfortune! - We can thank the cat for that. - Oh no, Robert instead. - No, the headmaster is to blame. - One can't make head or tail of it. - One can't, but I can. The school servant is to blame. On his way from the pub he says... Yes! It is all my fault. I wanted to kill the cat, I did most terrible things to Robert. And I was a bootlicker. I beg your pardon, headmaster. You can't be amazed. What kid would stand a father like me! Olda! Come home, I promise I'll never do it again. What should I judge you! I'm the biggest malingerer of all. My own child is sick of me. When Joey comes back, I'll be the best worker. They'll show me on exhibitions! And who is without blame? - We didn't deserve this, though. - The headmaster is to blame. This is no use. We must get down on our knees and beg off Robert and the cat. For God's sake, how many dirty tricks we plotted. Ask the headmaster! Go ahead, ask me. Is there anything more beautiful - than sincere self-criticism? - Yes. You have erred, comrades, but you are forgiven. - Now we must unite our efforts. - Wait a moment! The school servant - said something about plotting. - Come now, Marianne, don't drag him through the mud, can't you see he feels guilty. - He'd clatter too much. - Let him clatter! - Let the school servant speak. - Yes. If you believe me, good people, I will speak up, I'll speak up even if I should die! - And what about your self-criticism? - I've erred, I know, but tell me yourself in what. I believed in people, quite blindly. But you heard it yourself. A bootlicker, a malingerer... simply disgusting. This is a grave moment, comrades. You are looking for a culprit, but it is too late. How many times did I warn you! I tried by hook or by crook, he did not listen, he had his own head. Finally, he set the children to paste poster all over the town. - That is the truth, Marianne. - And who hunted the cat with a rifle? I don't know, some may have, but I was hunting hare. So that's why you shot every tom-cat? - I saw it with my own eyes... - Enough, Tonya. I think it would be best if you bring Tabby here, don't you think so? - What do you say to that? - As you wish, I'll gladly get rid of it, besides, it didn't do anything to me. - Fetch the cat. But alive. - I will. Nothing. Not a trace of them. - What? - Shut up, Madonna. Why doesn't Robert speak through the loudmouth. The kids always loved him. I propose that their favourite teacher and the most able member of my staff speaks to the missing pupils. Comrade Robert. - Yes. - You are right. - Let bygones be bygones. - Dear children... - Especially my Peter. - It is me, your teacher Robert. I am waiting for you with your mums and dads. If you saw how sad they are and me too. You did not betray your cat friend, you were keeping your fingers crossed for me and that's very nice of you. But it won't be any help, if you keep on hiding. If you come back, we'll be together again, so that no one harms a hair on Tabby's sharp-eyed head. That's why you should hurry back so that we can play together and tell each other that the most beautiful thing in the world is friendship. Come, you rascal. And the little lady. - Peter. - My boy. - Where's Tabby? - Right here! - He can't see. - Put away that stocking. - Besides, we've all shown our true colours. - Indeed. Wait, you've cuddled Tabby and now we have to guard him like the apple of the eye. - You shameless liar. - Who will guard him? - I promised to give him to the children. - And didn't they have him? - Tell me, Olda. - You're behaving like kids. We could congratulate each other on that. I beg your pardon. Come on, Robert. Be sensible. Come on, Robert. Be sensible. Do you hear it? A chameleon. Look, he's a chameleon! You won, after all. Are you happy? Come with me, Robert. Will you? Once upon a time... it should have happened!
