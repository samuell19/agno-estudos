I got business here! - Come on. - Can't you just take him in the hall? If he dies, Marcie, you can lay him out with the baby and the three of youse can turn the trick together.

What difference does it make? So I fucked up. That's the story of your life... fucking up. What do I got to do, carry you every place to make sure you get there? Is that what a brother's for? What do you think, it's some kind of “he's not heavy, he's my brother” crap? Let me tell you something, man. You are heavy. I was hustling a hot truck all last night waiting for you. - So we'll get another one tonight. - So I get another one tonight. - All right. - You just be there. (TOOL CLANKS ON GROUND) HANK: Psst!

You're gonna be clean when you get on the outside. Yeah, baby. Nothin' to do with... They let you out, huh? Man, when I get out, my first shot... You're never getting out. Those cats out there are shooting castor oil. The dealers have all split. You know Santo, the guy who runs the West Side? Santo? Ever hear of Santo? - We don't know him here.

BOBBY: (WHISPERING) The next thing I know, there's a big shipment in... ...and Santo is in charge of it all, ...and they need somebody to come in with them. So everybody is wondering... ...and talking about who it's gonna be. So guess who it's gonna be. Well, who? Me. Santo wants you? Why not? Anybody. - And why not me? - It's dangerous. Santo's not gonna give you the stuff on credit. - You need money. - So I'll get the money. SCOFFS: Yeah. - No more penny ante shit with Hank, I'll tell you that. Listen, I was thinking maybe, uh... ...when you get out, we could go to the country and live. The country? Sure. And eat nuts? I don't know, man. I'm letting Hank work for me. - Hank wanted to come today. - Yeah, well, fuck him. If it wasn't for him and his big-deal fucking caper, I'd be on the street now, married. He got back and saw the cop. There was nothing he could do. - He could get me out of here. - He's trying. His lawyer's working on it. Meanwhile, I'm playing with myself. - It...It's bad outside. - Yeah? There's nothing. Narcs aren't even busting anyone, there's so little around. I think about you all the time. Really. When you're clean, that's all you can think about. I can't stop myself. I think about that first time we made it together. I can let it go for two hours just thinking about that one time. I go to the chaplain. I tell him I've got dirty thoughts. You go to the chaplain? I know. It's a change. It breaks the routine. You make me laugh. You know what you make me? Do you want to know what you really make me? Listen, uh, I gotta go. No, don't go. Don't go. I'm gonna have all the stuff in Needle Park. I never wanted anything but you. I want you so bad. HOTCH: Hey, Bobby. Oh! Look who's here. - Did you have a nice stay? - It was wonderful.

You've been peddling your ass all over the West Side. - You don't understand, Bobby! - Don't give me that shit! ( sobbing continues ) You've been shooting it, and you've been selling it! Huh? I was gonna marry you! I was gonna marry a whore! You know that? I was gonna marry a whore! You're a whore! ( grunts ) Open the door! Open the door, Helen, or I'll break it down. Open the door! Helen, open the door, or I'll break it down. No! Son of a... Look at this shit! ( sobbing continues ) ( knocks ) Helen. Come on, open the door. I won't hit you, Helen. Come on, open the door. Helen, I won't hit you. Helen? Helen? - Don't hit me. - No, I won't. I can't stand anybody hitting me. ( bobby sighs ) Why didn't you come to me, Helen? I could have helped you. You were gone. You could have gone to Hank. I did. I balled him. Why did you tell me that? - I'd rather hook than ball Hank. - Oh. You shouldn't have told me that. Why did you tell me that? Ohh... Okay, you once said that you wanted to go to the country, right? Well, I don't know how, but maybe we could... ...we could go there. No more games. It was a game. It was a game, all right. Yeah, no games. - No games. - No games. So that's it, Helen. It's all set. I'm the supplier. (WATER RUNNING, STOPS) Helen, I'm the supplier, man. We're gonna have stuff coming out of our ears. Man, I tell ya, I just sat in that car, and I talked and I talked. I said, don't blow this one, man. - Where you going? - Baby, we don't have any money. What are you talking about? We're gonna have thousands and thousands of dollars. Not in time to get either one of us straight today. I don't want you to do that. Just until you score. It doesn't mean anything. ( door opens, closes ) ( no audible dialogue ) ( four quick knocks ) ( three slow knocks ) I want to, uh, speak to him. Sir... ( whispering ) ( laughing ) They move in, he gets the ball, passes it, moves around... Ooh! Here you go! ( grunting ) We win. ...ls that all there is? No, man, I got more. Don't worry. - Is Santo gonna give you another piece? - Yeah. Yeah. I've got some stashed, Helen, just in case. In case of what? What's the matter with you, man? In case I get busted. I'm gonna need this stuff to raise money for a lawyer. I gotta tell you that? ( groans ) Silence, Hank. Would you like to ball him? Maybe. ( sighs ) I think I'm gonna go. I got business. Fuck! You! You boosted it! - Bobby, I didn't know where it was. - I had a whole stash! - You could have told... - I told you! You could've told Chico or Hank you were playing the big businessman. Santo won't give me another piece! I don't have any money! Could we please talk about something else for a change? I don't have any money! ( crying softly ) You awake? - What are you crying for? - Nothing. Then cut it out. I don't like it. You know, sometimes I think you don't want me to do anything. You know that? It hasn't made things any better, has it? What do you mean, it hasn't? - You make all this money, but we still never have any. - I got big, man. You're doing it all for us, but we never see each other. I mean... ...look at me. Stop talking like my old lady, man. ( whimpering, crying ) Oh, God. You by yourself? You aren't gonna talk to me, huh? You got it. You're coming down, aren't you? What's it like being a cop? Well, we busted a guy the other day. Took about an hour to find the tracks. He was shooting in his privates. You know what I mean? Did that pretty much do it for you? Hey, Helen. ( no audible dialogue ) Not now. Ten minutes. I've got a trick. We need the bread. - Why here, man? - Ten minutes. She puts me through these changes. Go fuck yourself. That's Samuels. U-E-L-S. MAN: Yeah, Samuels. How much money was involved, Mr. Samuels? Seventy-five dollars. It was in my wallet. She took it out when I was in the bathroom. - Why were you in the suspect's room? - We went up to get a couple drinks. There is no room service at the Martel. HOTCH: Marty. - Yeah? What's the story? The chick took him for 75 bucks, which we did find in her purse. Let me have her. She's been whoring all over the West Side. I know, but I need her for something else. - She turns you on? - It's a favor, Marty. - Okay. Then you handle the john. - All right. I was scared. Really scared. You're a hooker. You get busted. Anyway, I say that you're not busted till they put you in the tank. What you got there was just paperwork. What happened? Did they clean you out? Hmm? Oh, no. What are you doing, holding out on me? You know how old I was the first time I got busted? Nine. Stealing rubbers in a drugstore. I told the cop they was for Hank. You got a letter. Who's it from? - My mother. - Oh, yeah? Any bread? What'd she write you, a book? Oh, sh... What's the matter? Some friends of hers are coming. She wants me to see them. So see them. - No, I don't... - No, see them. No, I don't... For bread. ( humming ) - Hey, what's happening? - Hi. You ready? Almost. Good. - You look great, man. - I do? Yeah. Would you get my coat? Oh, where'd you get that ribbon? - You like it? - Looks great. Terrific. Listen, baby, don't push it, all right? - No. - Let them come to you. Okay. How do you feel? - Want me to go downstairs with you? - Please. All right, let's go. CHICO: A little bit longer, darling. - Just shut up. - We're gonna be in Fort Lauderdale... - Get out of here. There's Bobby. Bobby! Come here. - What's happening? - If you're looking for Helen, she's using Marcie's. Yeah, that's right. She got all dressed up to go downtown. What's she doing at Marcie's place? Oh, come off it. She put on a hair ribbon to do that, right? CHICO: Don't he know? Your first time? No. Why, did it seem like it? No. It was great. Uh, listen, I, um... I gotta be out of here in eight minutes. Oh. I have an appointment too. - Could you put this out? - Sure. ( knocking ) BOBBY: Open this door, Helen! - Ten minutes. - Let me in. Come on, for Christ's sake. What now? You didn't go, right? What's this? Huh? - That's my wife. - I... You've been having, uh, assignation with my wife? - Huh? - I'm sorry. I oughta kill you. How'd you like it I balled your mother? - I..I'm sorry. - You're sorry? - Listen, I didn't know. - You didn't know? Get out of here. Go ball your governess. 20, 40, 50, 60. Come on, honey. Get away from here. What are you grabbing? It's been a long time. Since what? Since we laughed about anything. Yeah, well... Well, Fun City, you know? No more fighting. ( horn blaring ) I like this one. How much is he? - Fifty dollars. - Fifty dollars? It's little. It's not gonna eat that much. - Fifty dollars for that? - Come on. Come on. - What is it, a male or female? - What difference does it make? - Well, it was a male this morning. - So was I. ( laughing ) - Please? - Oh, if you beg, of course. ( giggles ) There you are. Take care. He's found a bone. Come on. Look at that dog. - Hey, Skip. - No, this dog's not a Skip. Come on, Rocky. Sounds like a prizefighter. Hey, are you a prizefighter, huh? ( giggles ) - This what you want? - Mmm. - No more hooking. - We'll make out. - Coming down? - Yeah. Let's wait till we get Rocky home. We'll wait. We'll wait. ( horn blares ) How are you? ( giggles ) Everything's gonna be all right. Yeah. A fresh start. Maybe we ought to move. Get an extra room for the dog. Out of Needle Park. That's where I live, Helen. - You know? - We'll stay there. Let's get off, man. - Wait. - No. I don't want you coming down when I'm up, all right? Where? The men's room. Come on. Come on. ( dog yelps ) ( whines ) (WHINING CONTINUES) Come on, get him out. - No, Bobby. - Get him out. - Come on. - No, please. Stay here. Stay with him. HELEN: Shh. (WHINING CONTINUES) ( dog barking ) Hey, where's Rocky? Where's the champ, huh? What's the matter? ( gasps ) What happened, man? ( crying continues ) What's the matter? (SHIP'S HORN BLARES) What happened? MARCO: You can stay here if you like. I'm going to Mexico pretty soon. You've been through some changes since I saw you. And now you want to wipe all that out. You could if you wanted to. I gotta talk to you. Yeah? Where'd you go? Marco's. I figured that. What, did you ball him? You didn't? No. I thought you'd never come back. I couldn't stay. That's my wake-up. - You stole my wake-up. - Bobby, I needed it I take you back, and you steal my wake-up? - I was gonna score for you. - You're supposed to love me. I love you. I was gonna go out and score for you. Give it to me! - I love you. - If you love me, give it to me! (SYRINGE SHATTERS ON FLOOR) You fuck! Jesus! Now neither of us has any! What seems to be the trouble? Well, I have a kidney stone. I was gonna get an operation, but I didn't want to leave the kids alone. Mm-hmm. What about your husband? Couldn't he help? We're divorced. He's living in Pittsburgh. He's got a new wife, and she doesn't like kids. - Don't you have a doctor of your own? - He died. His nurse told me, uh, that I needed a prescription for the medicine. That's why I came here. - For a kidney stone? - It hurts. Mrs. Rogers, are you an addict? No. Mrs. Rogers? Please? I need something. Please. ( sighs ) I can't give you a prescription. Here. - No. - Now, don't hit me again. - Please? - No. Thank you. Did you have to trick him? I've been tricking a doctor for three weeks just to get some. He don't give me money, just pills. Took four. Gonna sell the rest. HOTCH: Pushing pills. Bobby's playing king of the mountain, and you're pushing pills to kids. ( sighs ) You ever been in a house of detention, Helen? Heard about it? Seen it? It's like a zoo. Those diesels, when they see a cute chick like you, they're not gonna screw around. They're gonna take your brains out, scramble 'em and have you for breakfast. You having fun? I think I'm going to do you a little favor, Helen. I got a friend who works in the DA's office. Think I'm gonna have this fixed for you. Hi. That didn't take long, did it? But that's only a pretrial. You still got a hearing next month. You sure do know the right people. No, you do. I want Santo. I've never even seen him. - Can't help you. - Then you're gonna have to give me Bobby. No. How did you like it in there last night, Helen? I won't. You're sitting on a one-to-three. That's a long time without any shit. You give me Bobby, and you'll go free. Bobby knows what the game is. He won't do more than six months. He'll give me Santo. Look... I'll give you Sammy, Sonny, anyone... ...you rat up, you don't rat down. I can't. I want Santo. There isn't any stuff around. Bobby's not gonna see Santo. There's a new shipment all over Harlem. It'll be downtown. That's the game that you're playing, Helen. I didn't make the rules. You son of a bitch! - Seen Bobby? - No, he ain't around. It's all over, baby. No more panic. What happened? Your old man, ...he's got an acre of it. Straight out of Philadelphia, man. Oh, man, three pieces. Baby, we're in, man, we're in. No more pushing pills, right? Do you love me? - Hmm? - I love you. I got people working for me now, Helen. I just sit there and count the bread. Say you love me. You know, Santo said... ...he's gonna give me as much as I can sell. Huh? You dream about these things. You want to? I...really want to. All right, baby, all right. It's okay. Here. I haven't heard from you, Helen. Leave me alone, Hotch. You got a case coming up in two weeks. I can't do it. You better think about it. Baby, baby. You're taking too much. You know that? We got plenty. You don't have to take it all at once. What's the matter? Hmm? You worried about your old lady? Is that it? If you're worried about her, why don't you call her? Maybe tomorrow. I love you. That's wonderful. That's terrific. Hotchner. You want to ball me? It's not gonna be that easy, Helen. I want Bobby. Get out of here. You've got a week. What day is it? Wednesday. You got a big appointment or something? Helen, I gotta go out for a couple of hours. Why don't you put some clothes on before Hank comes. - Don't go. - I gotta go. I got business. Please don't go. Baby, what do you want me to do? Crawl in here and die with you? For Christ's sake! The past three days, all you're doing is lying here! You don't get up, you don't get dressed! I want you to shape up! Goddamn it, I want you to shape up and get some clothes on! You want to give it to Hank, go outside and do it! ( door closes ) Hold it, pal. BOBBY: (MUTTERS) Shit. Cuff him. BOBBY: (SHOUTING) Cunt! You cunt, you! - I was going to marry you! - All right, get in! Bobby? Well?
