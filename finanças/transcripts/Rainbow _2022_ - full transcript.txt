You were a little stinker right from the start, eh? You came feet-first, and... they say that it's very lucky if you're born that way. That's why you're so lucky. Hmm. You were so... so little and so... so helpless, you know? The day you were born, you changed my life. What? [spoon tapping] I don't look like you. People say that I look like my mother. - [wind whistling] - [shutters rattle] Uh, yeah, you look a lot like her. [Dora] Yeah. You remember... that day... a woman came to our house. Uh, she was a friend, you said. I was like 11 or 12. Um... You talked to her for a long time at the door. [shutters rattle] You remember? - Yeah, sure I do. - [rattling continues] That woman... that was my mother, right? [shutter bangs] [inhales deeply] How come you told me she was just a friend? [shutters rattling] Because I thought it was better than telling you that... she was your mother and she came here for money. Huh. Yeah. Yeah, sure. [sighs] Papa, you lied to me. You said you never saw her again. Sit down, please. [shutter banging] Please. - [sighs] - [shutters continue] I never saw her again, that's true. You're lying. - [rattling] - [wind whistles] I want to see her, and know why she left us. She left because she wasn't well and she thought it was best for you. I want her to tell me. I want to understand. Dora, even if I wanted to help you find her, I wouldn't know how, okay? Yes, you do. And I'm going. That's not happening. - [wind gusting] - [windows clatter] - [thunder rumbles] - [crackling] [lightning crashes] - Dora! - [door opens] Dora! [thunder rumbles] [Papa] Dora, come back!

[woman 2 sighs] I thought I could do it, but I can't, Coco. I can't. [Coco] How many times have we talked about this? - I can't take it anymore. - [woman 2] I just can't! [Coco] Don't be silly, listen to me. It's basically assisted euthanasia, hmm? Why don't you just do it? Maribel, God! He's my husband. [sighs] [sadly] Oh. Suddenly, now you get sentimental? [inhales sharply] I put up with all sorts of things for this son of a bitch. You did as well. It's our time now. Now we... have half our lives ahead of us. [sighs] Come on. Come on. Come on! I am not going to unplug him, Coco! You make me so upset, you know that? Hey. - Who's there? - [young woman] Who are you? Uh... the door was opened and... uh, I'm looking for my mother. I think she used to work here. Who is this girl? One of you two is my grandmother. What do you mean? Yes, I am. [dramatic musical flourish plays] Her grandmother? Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did you call her? Maribel, tell me who this girl is. [device beeping rapidly] [EKG machine flat-lining] Arturo! [Coco] Rosita! Call Félix. [Rosita sobs] - Don't touch anything. - [Rosita] Oh, Mr. Arturo! That's enough. Don't make a scene. Come on. - I don't like scenes. - Let's go. [Coco] Come on. The pain is mine to bear. You should put together a dark three-piece suit, with a white shirt, black shoes, and a black tie. Go on, and get him ready. Ai-ai-ai. [laughs] [chuckles] So you're Dora. Your mom's Pilar. [chuckles] Did you... did you know her? Of course. We came here when I was little. It's my aunt Coco's house, and your mom looked after my cousin and me. I remember this one time, she let us smoke when we were nine or ten. [laughs] But when she got pregnant, they kicked her out. Uh, pregnant with me? The baby supposedly died at birth, but this is a house of witches, so it's hard to know what's actually true. But you know what the craziest thing is? What? Everything is true. All of it. You choose which truth to live in. [breathes deeply] Stay here. [box lid closes] Look, the last thing we heard was that she worked here. It's in Capital City. [Coco] You're such a bitch! Unbelievable! We're not talking about this now. You're upset, it's understandable. Come on, take a lorazepam. There, that's it, relax... Oh! You don't know what I'm capable of! You bitch, with your duplicitous face! You monk! Your hair makes you look like a monk! Please don't call me a monk, Coco. - [young woman] You like 'em? - Yeah, they're amazing. Keep 'em. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Because I want you to wear them. And because you're gonna need them. You just make me so angry! [screams] [shatters] [stressful atonal music plays] You pick it up, huh? Okay, you just need to calm down. We'll control the situation. That's what you want. To get me out of the way, huh? - Why would I want you out of the way? - Well, don't worry. - I'll get myself out of the way for you! - What are you doing? - Getting out of the way. - Coco, drop the gun. - That's what you want, isn't it? - Coco, please, just put it down. [Coco] I don't want to, you fucking liar. - Put it down, it's not even loaded. - Oh, it's not? - Should we give it a try? - Put it down! - No, no, no! Auntie, no! Please! No! - [Toto barks] - Please! - Let go! - Fuck you! - [gun fires] [Toto barks] [whimpers, gasps] - [Dora gasps] - [Maribel exclaims] [groans] Oh... [Toto yaps] - [gasps] - [footsteps approaching] [Maribel gasps] What the hell? What happened? It was an accident. Uh... [Rosita gasps and sobs] Arturo had already died, that's why we called you. Uh, we... we were arguing, and the gun went off... boom! And... How are you going to explain that the second-richest man in the country just died mere minutes before someone blew his face off? - [Rosita sobbing] - [sighs] Either way, mm... the girl pulled the trigger. What are you saying? They were talking about unplugging him. - What? - [Dora] I heard them. What? This girl doesn't know what she's talking about. Who is this girl? We don't know. She broke into the house. She's my granddaughter. Oh, well, I... I don't think this was an accident, I'm telling you. Coco. I mean, this girl entered private property, snuck into the house, and with this pistol, she shot my husband. That's what occurred. Well, maybe... this girl is a murderer. [stressful music intensifies] - You're joking, right? - No, sweetheart. I'm not joking. Go call the police. Uh... [whimpers softly] Go get her! Yeah, okay, we will. We're not running after her, Coco. Just call the police. Can you call? [voice echoing] Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! [gasps] [Diego] Dora, breakfast is ready. [sighs] Shit, Papa, I had the weirdest dream. I was at the Weizegs' house. [Diego] Who are the Weizegs? Papa... the Weizegs. Papa? Papa! [laughing ominously] Papa! [gasps] [Toto whines] [vehicle approaching] Hey. There's no bus here. Huh? There's no bus coming. The wind knocked a pole down. - And the road's closed. - Okay. Uh, thanks, I guess. Are you a girl or a woman? Um...

Bye. No more phone calls, or we'll never finish this, okay? - Ah, excuse me, detective. - [chuckles softly] Uh, where were we? [sighs] It's okay. - I... I was saying... - Mm-hmm. I just need to know what happened so we can start the investigation. So Arturo was already dead when he was shot? [tense sparse piano music plays] Um, we don't really know if he was dead or not. Um, Maribel and I believe so. But we're not doctors. Hmm? - And what about the gun? - That's what I can't figure out. Because that weapon was hidden there for ages and I just don't know how did that girl know? It's just... Anyway, everything was so fast and I'm so confused, and... [inhales] And I... I can't really... I can't remember the story. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what to say. Anyway, she... she fled. And someone who's innocent wouldn't run in that situation. [detective] Okay, so... [Maribel sighs] ...the girl who shot him is your granddaughter? Well, who knows? [scoffs] That's what the girl said. But Maribel hasn't talked to her daughter in years. It's true. She's my granddaughter. The daughter of Pilar. I always thought she had died at birth. A couple summers ago, her dad started bringing her to town. And I guess people, they started to say she was Pilar's. I assumed they were just rumors. Until last night. That girl came looking for something. She showed up with such an attitude, thin and cocky. Oh, Félix! Hello, Antonio. I'm sure you know she can't make any statements without me present. - Okay. - Yes, yes. The lady is very tired. And we haven't slept all night. And at her age... Well, then we'll continue this another time. - Coco, my condolences. - Mm-hmm. - I'll do whatever's in my power to help. - Thank you, Antonio. Rosita! See him out. I've been looking over the will, and there's a couple of donations, but that's it. It's really very simple, Coco. Since he didn't have any children, you're the sole heir. - Aren't you going to tell him? - Tell me what? Félix needs to know about it. What do I need to know about? [Coco] Mm. I'm pregnant. What do you mean, pregnant? - [Coco chuckles] - Mm-hmm. You heard me. Arturo didn't agree with this. He said I was too old, can you believe it? But I've been doing some expensive fertilization treatments for a while now, with placenta from belugas, with stem cells, and all that stuff. And... here we are. I'm at three months. - [chuckles] - [smacks lips] A miracle. Oh, Toto, I think we're lost. [Diego on recording] Dora, I was wrong, all right? But you can't leave like this.

No. I was thinking that we might need to forget the cops and handle it on our own. What do you mean? Just that. Handle it ourselves. Should I spell it out? - Coco. - What? Please don't. You see? [sighs] I just can't trust you. You say you're family, but that's a lie. [Maribel] Don't start. Don't go there. Go where? Don't say things that later you might regret. That I might regret? [chuckles softly] Sit down. I said sit. Do you want some? No. I'm not hungry. Ah, you're not hangry. Well, look, if anyone should be angry, it's me, huh? But I... I really don't care if you knew that she was alive, if you brought her here or you didn't. I forgive you, Maribel. I forgive you if you really want to be forgiven. And in that case, you have to stand by me and help me find her. And put a stop to this tension that makes my stomach turn and has me overwhelmed. It's your choice. Either you stay with me, and we take over the company, the house, and everything else, or... you rent a tiny place, and you can take the bus once a month to prison to visit your granddaughter. Hmm? You choose. Go on. [grunts] [urinating] - [car door closes] - [honks] Hey. Hey! Hey! Whoa!

And, "You have it all, so what's wrong with you?" "You have everything, everything's great." Sure. "Live in the present." Well, how do you do that? How do you do it? How, I mean... I do everything that... that society dictates to make it better. I meditate, I do acupuncture, I go to therapy, I swim, and... I... I've bought creams, I've tried it all. I've tried everything there is, but there's no meaning still, and no one's okay. Everyone smiles, but they're all just faking it. [mock laughs] No, it's all bullshit. Living isn't easy. You should try lithium. - Huh? What do I need to try? - Lithium. You won't want to die on lithium. Lithium? [snaps fingers] You're not well in here. But, hey, we're not doing too well up here. Everyone's got their issues. Whew! So fresh! [sighs happily] Just look how fresh I am, girl! You gonna go back to your brother? Pshht. No. Mm, it wasn't the first time. It's just... I'm just like this. And he... he's not. He's... He... He's really scared. And I'm scared, too, but I... I don't let the fear control me. I think fear is bullshit. [chuckles] That's true.

Huh? - What have you done for me? - Everything, Coco! I gave up my daughter. You gave up your daughter because you were totally broke. Do you really believe that I've been with you this entire time for the money? Haven't you? It's over. That's right, that's right. Go on! - Go! Leave, leave!

According to police sources, the main suspect is Dora Galán, a young woman we still don't... Muñeco. Muñeco! - Muñeco. Muñeco! - What? What, what, what? ...last week on Tuesday, but the cause of death was not revealed to the public. [phone ringing] [grunts softly] [phone continues ringing] - Hello? - [woman] Hello. You're Pilar's daughter, right? This is Valle, from the bar. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. What is it? [Valle] Look, I found your mother. Pure luck, but I found her. Are you there? Yes, I'm here. - You have something to write with? - Uh... Yeah, go ahead. Write this down. - Pasaje de los Monos, 25. - Mm-hmm. It's in Chinatown, in Capital City. Okay.

There's no lion here. - What? - Are you sure it was a lion? - Yeah, I swear, there was a fucking lion! - It's got a lion smell. Maybe you were dreaming? No. No, no, no. - I saw it. - [Jose Luis] Where's Akin? [car doors close outside] Akin must have left before I woke up. [car door closes] Oh, fuck! Pigs, pigs! It's the pigs, pigs. The pigs, the pigs, the pigs. We saw it on the news, Dora. They're after you. - You took out that rich old guy, right? - No, I didn't do anything. I don't know what to do. I don't want to get you guys in trouble. Let's go. ["McFly" by CA7RIEL playing] [Muñeco] Pigs are coming, pigs are coming. Let's go, let's go! Pigs!

Yes. Follow me, she's waiting for you. [workers chattering loudly] ["Intro" by CA7RIEL continues] Shhh! [workers stop talking] [croaks deeply] Get in. In here? All right. [music intensifies] Pilar? Dora. What are you doing here? Where's Pilar? Your mother's not here, hon. We don't know where she is. She doesn't want to see me either. Oh, my God. - You look just like her... - What do you want? Why'd you make me come here? [Mirabel sighs] I want to help you, Dora. Your life's in danger. Coco could do anything. What's her problem with me? Why is she accusing me? It's a long story. I'll tell you if you want, sit down. [lighter flicks] [exhales] Sixteen years ago, the day you were born, changed... everything. Coco found out about you, and, well, she... she lost her composure. She became aggressive and violent. [Coco] Hey! [Maribel] She was out of her mind. Pilar disappeared that day. I don't get it. I mean, she was young, she got pregnant. What's that got to do with Coco? Your mother blames it on me. Because everyone knows that mothers are to blame for everything. Always. I'm guilty of raising her to not question the men in her life. I'm guilty of allowing Arturo, a filthy, disgusting old man, to abuse her until he got her pregnant. [tense music plays] I'm guilty of turning a blind eye, and of keeping quiet, because I thought if my mother and I had been through it as well, it was normal. So normal... that the one I felt bad for was Coco. I felt sorry to the point that I understood her punching my Pilar's belly so she would miscarry. I've forgiven so many things. So many things... [inhales sharply] But not anymore. It's over. But just look at you. Now everything is fine. It was all for a reason. Destiny wanted that baby to be here. [chuckles] And you're here. As a child, when I saw the news on television, I always thought I wouldn't be able to endure all the evil in this world. But you get used to it. That's being an adult. You're his only child. You'll inherit a lot. I'll make you the richest and most powerful girl this country's ever seen. [audio distorts] You'll see. You're my miracle girl. You'll be living like a princess... - [doors rattle distantly] - [footsteps echoing] [audio distorts] Hey, kiddo? Dora? Dora? - No, no, no! - Dora? Tell us what happened. [Muñeco] The pigs are still looking for you. [footsteps echoing dramatically] Hey! [whooshing] - [audio returns to normal] - [people chattering] [chuckles] [playing "Storm" from Vivaldi's Summer] [bicycle bell rings] [vendor] Hey, cops! Cops, cops! - [cop] Hey! Hey, stop! - Cops! - Stop right now! Police! - [Muñeco laughs] - [laughs] - [Toto barks] [siren wails] [man] Run, run! They've seen us! [Muñeco grunts] Stop! [cop] Hey! Stop that man! - Watch out! - [cop] Hey, stop right there! Police! [cop] Stop! [woman exclaims] [coins jangle] Get on the ground! - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Freeze, police! [Muñeco] Whoa, what a machine! Look at him! Whoo! [Muñeco laughs] Yeah, yeah! [women all speak indistinctly] [all arguing] [all yelling] Hey, there's that guy! Look at him go! You can't catch him! Look at him go. Freeze, police! Come here! - Freeze! - Hey! Gotcha! Get him! - Dora Galán, right? - Yeah. Come with me. You're under arrest. Huh? [tense music plays] [gate slams shut] [siren wails in distance] [gate slams in distance] [Diego] Hey, I'm here for my daughter. We're just waiting for the commissioner to sign. He's almost here. That is the father of the girl who murdered Arturo Weizeg. - She's our friend... - What are you saying? - She didn't kill anyone. - No! [clicks tongue] Shh. You're her father, right? We got the footage from the security cameras, and they confirm that it was an accident. [sighs in relief] She's gonna be released immediately. - The commissioner's here... - She'll be right out. [gate buzzes] [Muñeco] Oh, there she is. - [gate clangs] - [Toto whines] [Dora] Toto! - Hello. - [gate buzzes] [Diego] Let's go, Dora. Thank you. [seat belts click] [engine starts] [brakes squeak gently] You're not my dad. Dora! [echoing] [train rumbles] Dora! [echoing] [Felix] Following confirmation from the judge, and thanks to the DNA test which proved that Dora Galán is the daughter of the deceased, the inheritance of Mr. Arturo Weizeg Molina will be divided as follows. Two thirds will go to his only daughter, Miss Dora Galán, of which half belongs to Miss Coco Cabrera until Ms. Galán is 18. The last third of the disposable portion is awarded in the will to Miss Coco Cabrera. This means that, technically, both Dora Galán and Coco Cabrera are the sole shareholders of the W business conglomerate. [doorbell rings] Who's there? [door opens] Who is it? It's Mrs. Maribel. She's here to pick up her things. Okay. I'll get ready and she can come up in five minutes. [tense music plays] [softly] She's a lot more calm today than yesterday. [Coco] Oh, you're here. Come in, Maribel, come in. [chuckles] Are you gonna take that? It's mine. - It's not yours. - Yes. - I bought it the summer we went to Rome. - But I chose it. I bought it with my money. All right, I won't fight over a plate. You... can take it. I mean, it's yours. Um... you might not care, but, um... I've had a horrible couple of days. Hmm. Without you, I didn't know which pills to take, or when. [sighs] You betrayed me. You left me no other choice. I know. I've been unfair with you. But, um... now that I've been, well, alone, you know, really alone, um, I've realized I need you. Oh, Coco. It's just so difficult to find qualified staff these days... - What? - I'm just joking. [chuckles] It's just... I'm very embarrassed to say what I have to say. I want you back, I want another chance. Can we start over? [Coco] Mmm? You're incredible, Coco. And... And with Dora if you want. Uh, after all, I mean, she's Arturo's daughter, and she's your blood, huh? Um, with time, maybe she can be like the daughter that we both lost. Hmm? [sighs] What do you want, Maribel? Do you want me to get on my knees? Eh? [sobs] Look at me! What do you see? An old woman who needs to be looked after. No, Coco, you're not. - [sobs] - Oh, God. Please, don't. You're not. That's not what you are, Coco, you're not. Just relax, okay? That's it. That's it. - Maribel, Maribel, Maribel... - You're okay, that's it.

Behind Arturo, there were two women. What a surprise, huh? [laughs] You know, Arturo was always surprising people. [chuckles] And I was never bored with him. Not once! I thank him for that. Ah, in any case, thank you, Arturo. [applauding] Come here, kid! Here you are. So now, the two of us are here. Two women on the board of directors.
