Hey everybody and welcome to another episode of the Terrible Terror Podcast. And I'm joined as always by my co-host from across the pond, Neil. Hey Neil, how's it going? I'm doing great Brian. Really looking forward to talking about this thing you emailed me about this morning. Thanks for tuning into 92.9, The Raven this morning, I'm Gil T. Smith. We have breaking news, the Lawford County Sheriff's office has announced they will be releasing items collected as evidence in the gruesome 2010 and 2011 Unlisted Owner murders. The actual footage from a series of murders and disappearances that occurred in Lawford County, Illinois in 2010 and 2011 is getting a worldwide release. And for our final segment tonight on Angry Dad Podcast, we will be talking about the release of the up-and-coming film, Unlisted Owner. Hey everyone, welcome to Clint's Crime Corner, I'm your host, Clint Buckler coming at you from the great white north. Now if you recall back in 2011, we covered a series of murders that took place in Lawford County, Illinois, known as the Owner Killings. And for today's episode, we're gonna dive right back into that mystery. Welcome to the Smores Indoors podcast my name is Corey, your host and I am joined as always by Jonathan. Jonathan, what's going on? Not a whole lot. Excited for tonight's show and excited to talk about the real crime scene evidence from the Owner Killings in Lawford County, Illinois. So from now to Halloween, I'll be naming off my bucket list of haunted places I wanna visit. So my first pick is the Owner House in Lawford County, Illinois. A family of five was murdered in the house they'd just moved into. And now they're saying that there are six people that are missing, plus a cop. They're calling this, The Owner Killings. I mean this sounds like a movie plot come to life. This film has the horror community divided into two. Alright, we're talking about people that feel films should just be films based on fictional or real events, nothing real about it, alright? But on the other side of the argument, we have actual terror, we have actual fear, we have actual horror. No smoke and mirrors, no fucking stunt doubles, alright? Actual fear, actual terror that we can see. I've always been so intrigued by not only the murders and disappearances that happened there, but this beautiful house, ugh, I love it. Since we mentioned it in the past episode, you're likely aware that in order to renew interest in this case again, the family of the victims have agreed to the release of the footage from the night these events took place in hopes of getting some sort of new leads. Now, before you asked, yes they are releasing the actual murder footage. Yeah, it's hard to believe this is happening. To have these murders that took place in our backyard coming to a TV near you, it's just insane. Yeah man, I mean, I was just in Lawford County yesterday. Let's just say that the people are livid, that the families are allowing this. Hey y'all just wanted to reach out to you and let everybody know, stay away from South Main near the Lawford County Courthouse. There's a large crowd out there, and they're probably protesting release of the murder footage. We would also like to report that class will be dismissed early today as a result of the protest occurring all over the community, after recent announcements from the Lawford County Sheriff's Department. Should this film just stay inside the Lawford County evidence locker, or should it be released? Comment down below, let me know your thoughts. And I know, you wanna know what I think about this. It's disgusting. Completely disgusting, in my opinion. I feel like it's a cash grab. And I understand what the what the families went through, it was completely horrible. But being the true crime buff that I am, I'm down with reenactments of crimes, but not seeing the actual footage of the murders. And how the Lawford County Sheriff's Department can even allow this, it's completely beyond me. As you know, Clint's Crime Corner had to make an attempt at reaching out to the Lawford County Sheriff's Department for a comment on the matter. But, as predicted, we never got a response from them. But I mean, if the families think this'll help them get answers, and it's gonna entertain the public, well, I'm cool with that. Yeah, same here. Hey everyone, hit that subscribe button because as soon as we find out when the footage from The Owner Killings in Lawford County's coming out, we will let you all know. Are we gonna review this thing when it comes out? I mean, I don't know. I mean, now that you say it, it does sound kinda morbid. You know what, screw it. We're gonna review it, we're gonna do it. We're gonna do it. Alright folks, you've heard it here. Come back for a full review, when the footage is released. Hey dad, need any help with that box? No I got it, honey. Okay. Hey Chloe, can you grab the door for me? Sure. Trenton, can you go grab that for sale sign out of the yard? - Alright. - Thanks, buddy. Hey dad, that box looks really heavy, what did mom pack in it? Trust me, enough. Hey mister, I heard that. It's just really hard, dad. Having to leave all my friends behind and having to do all of it in high school. I know sweetie, but this is the only place I can get a teaching job and trust me, you'll meet new friends. I don't want new friends, I want my friends. You're not the only one making sacrifices. I know you guys are still mad at us for this move, but look at this big house. Gimme a couple years, I'll fix it up, and you will love it. It'll be perfect. Hey, is there a key to unlock this door? I don't know, why don't you try the bolt first, stupid? Hey, you guys need to get outside and help your dad unload those boxes. I don't know what to do. I think someone's in the house. I don't know where everybody is. I just don't- - Chloe, what the hell is going on? I think someone's in the house. There's no one in the house honey, come on. Everything's gonna be okay.

A family of five has been found dead in their home this morning around 8:15am. See, told you guys. Any other details- - That's pretty crazy. Posted with any future updates, here on 95.9 The Raven. I can't believe that. Hey, here's Griff, he's coming. Hey, what's up man? Hey, you guys aren't gonna believe what we just saw on the way here. What you talking about? To do with, anything with the family of five that was found dead in their house today? Yeah, you should see the house, man. There's police cars and ambulances everywhere. You should see all the people out there, it's crazy. I can't even imagine. It's probably about a mile off the camp site. Right on the edge of town. Man. Dude, it's the big yellow one right across from the Wooler's place. That's crazy. Dude, they just bought that house not even a week ago. Fucking bad luck for them, right? No shit man. You guys are dumb. That's not even funny. Not even cool, guys. - Hey, we're mature. - Yeah. How about this, let's go see who's all out there. - I'm in. - Game? Griffin, you lead the way. - Let's go. - Road trip. Alright, let's go. Dude, look at this place, holy shit. Dude, you got that thing on, right? Yeah dude, it's rolling. Man, I'll tell you what, this is gonna be sweet. What's sweet about people's lives that were lost? Tell me you're not a little excited about seeing some dead bodies. No, I'm actually kinda freaked out. Andrea, just chill. It'll be all right, I promise. Right. You know we're just joking around anyway, Andrea. You know what, you might as well get used to it because you're gonna be with us all night long. Get away from me, you dumb ass. Jed, are you seriously gonna have that camera on here? Dude, there's nothing illegal about having your camera on. It's gonna be good footage. How about we have a little respect for the dead. Dude, there is nothing disrespectful about having your camera on, okay? News crews do it all the time, so just back off. It never can be used if you- - There he goes again, being a little bitch like always. No kidding. You go again, being a dick like always. Aww, listen to her, we love you too Haidee. Shut up, don't touch me. We should just leave, Griffin. I dunno, I kind of wanna to see what happened. Fine. You wanna know what happened? I'll find out what happened. Whoa dude, what are you doing? - Hey, whoa, whoa. - I'm gonna go- - No, you walk around... Fuck you guys. This is gonna be sweet. This is so crazy. Oh my God. Are they really bringing someone out? Oh my God. Dude, are you kidding me? - Holy crap. - Oh my God. - That is crazy. - No way. Oh my God. Dude, I wonder what happened. This is fucking nuts. That is so gross. Oh my God. I don't even wanna watch it. This is nasty. Holy shit. Why would they bring him out in front of everybody? Well what else are they gonna do? They got him in a body bag, that's good enough. I've never seen anything like this. Dude, that is nuts. How many people lived here? I think they said five. I only saw them bring out one though, body. Is that all you saw? Just one? Yeah. Fucking crazy shit. Did they get all the rest of them out? Yeah, I don't know. This is crazy. I don't believe this shit. Could give you nightmares. Ah, this is freaking nuts. Yeah. You guys seen what's goin' on? Dude, what the fuck Tanner? Son of a bitch, dude. Don't be sneaking up on us like that, man. - God. - Are you serious? We're a little uneasy as it is. From what I been hearing, they're all murdered. I think it's a serial killer. - Are you serious? - Yeah, right. Man, what gives you that idea, there hasn't been a murder here for like eight years or something like that. Like 15 years ago, this place almost burned to the ground. Can you remember that? - That was this place? - Right here. I didn't even realize that. What do you think happened then? Well, from all the stories, this is what I think. The guy was a union worker and he wasn't at the house all the time. But the wife was always there, and she was cheating on him. The kids even knew about it, the whole town knew about it. The one day he did find out, he went ballistic. He comes over to the house, locks them all up in the basement, shuts all the windows, and sets the place on fire. When the police arrived, they said they found five bodies. I don't think they found Tom's body. Ever since then, things have been going crazy. Like what? I know a couple guys have been falling off ladders. A guy lost this thumb. Man, this is stupid. That sounds like another dumb ass ghost story to me. Think whatever you want, but they're dead now, okay? Whatever, man. How about this for your ghost story, okay? That people came down here, they family, alright? They were probably halfway. - No, no, no - That's a ghost story. Telling you the story, tried helping you out. If you don't believe me, fine. I'm outta here. All right, see you Tanner. You guys are fuckin' assholes. Dude, that story is bullshit. You guys wanted to know what happened, he tried telling you. His story sounds legit to me. Whatever, dude. I don't know guys. I just know that I don't want to go camping this close to where someone's been murdered. Hey, you heard the douche bag, it's like hearsay. Nobody freaking got murdered or any of that. Where else are we gonna go camping, anyway? I don't know, we can just go somewhere else. This is the only land any of our families own. Seriously, come on man. And we're already here. We decided to stay so you two might as well stay with us. It just wouldn't be the same without you. That's true. You wanted to go camping for a month now. Yeah Griff, seriously stop being a pussy. And I don't want to be the only girl, so please Haidee don't leave me alone. She needs someone to keep her safe. Especially with these two idiots. - Oh, come on. - Oh shit. You girls won't be the only girls out there. There'll be a couple more. They just called you out. Yeah, your skanks don't count. - We're classy. - Oh shit. Hey, hear that? We lower our standards for reasons. All right well, just want to fucking go. Let's do this, come on Griff. - Let's go. - Come on Griff. - Alright. - Let's go. You'll be okay. That's the spirit. All right, hey, so everyone just meet at my house like around 5:30, we'll call it good? Yeah. All right, let's do this. Let's go get something to eat. Good Afternoon, I'm Detective Hoffee with the Lawford County Sheriff's Department. Can you please state your name for the record? Tanner Lewis. Okay Mr. Lewis, do you know why you're here? No. We've obtained video evidence of you, Mr. Lewis speaking with a Jed Groves, Gavin Landers, Tyler Brian, Griffin Potts, Andrea Mills and a Haidee Summers, three days ago at the scene of a multiple murder. What can you tell me about that? They were my friends and I just talked to 'em. I talked to my friends. And what was the conversation you had with them in the video? They asked me what happened. So I just told them the family was murdered. And then I told 'em it was, you know... it kind of reminded me of the story that happened in the same place 15 years ago. And what's the story? It's just from what I heard, but the guy who lived there, Tom. His name was Tom, And he found out that his wife was cheating on him, so he went crazy. He put the kids and the wife in the basement and burnt them all alive. The fire department says that they found the whole family in the basement burned alive. But the story is that they never found Tom's body. Is that all you talked to them about? Well, I told them... Yeah, that's what I said. The family who bought it died, and then I told them the story. Where did you go after... Where did they go after you spoke with them? I don't really know. I think they just went camping? Where did you go after you spoke with them? I went home. Okay, Mr. Lewis, we've got a family of five murdered, six other persons missing, an abandoned camp site, a missing police officer, and a three-story house that looks like a butcher shop. We need some answers. I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't know they were missing. I just thought they were there for that day. They went camping. I didn't know they're missing. You're the last person to see them. Look, I told you everything I know. Can I just go home? I've been here for three hours. I told you everything I know, I just... Look, I just wanna go home, I just wanna go home. I don't know. I don't know anything else. You seriously have that thing on everywhere we go. I mean, we're in a car, do you have to have it on? Andrea, Andrea, just stop it- - She's right Jed, you've had that thing on all day. Pretty soon it's going to be attached to your body. Get off me, Tyler. There's nothing wrong with this. I don't see what you guys are getting all bent out of shape about. It's annoying. No, but when we get out at the campsite, you better help. None of this shit like last time. I fucking helped last time. Listen Jed- - I'm tired of you guys always saying I don't help. I always fucking help. And besides, you know, Griffin's gonna have his camera out there too. So you can bitch at him all you want, alright? Good, so we're gonna have two worthless motherfuckers out there Oh my God. Hey, turn that up. This just in from the Lawford County Sheriff's Department regarding the horrific crime that occurred last night, the Sheriff's department has stated the deaths have been ruled as a homicide, with no suspects at this time. Anyone with information needs to call the Lawford County Sheriff's Department. Now back to the newest thing here on 95.9 The Raven. Oh my God. If Griffin heard that he's gonna be freaking out. - You know it, dude. - Hell yeah. I just hope he- - It's fucking Griffin. Are you serious? - Hello? - Oh fuck. Yeah, yeah man we heard it. Are you kidding me? No, there is no killer hiding out in the woods, Griffin. Hey, tell Griffin to tell Haidee that she can't leave me. You need to just stop being a pussy, alright? Tell him. Haidee, you can't leave me. Hey, Andrea says that Haidee can't leave her out here. Thank you. If you come out there and you get the sudden urge to leave, that's fine you can leave. But you at least have to help us set up camp. I mean, I really don't wanna have to unload this thing. We're already on our way, you have to help us set up camp. - You ain't gonna help anyway. - Fuck you. Yeah, all right, thanks bye. Are they still coming? - Yes. - Thank God. I'm surprised. I figured he'd just wanna go back home. He needs to stay out there. I mean, I have never met a guy that has been so scared so easily before. Yeah, me neither. It's kind of embarrassing. You seriously still have that thing on, Jed? What's the big deal? There's nothing wrong. You guys always get pissed off about the littlest stupid shit. I don't understand it. You have it on all the time. I just got this, you know I did. Just lay the fuck off. I mean, it's no different than him. Look at him, he's up here on his phone all the time. What are you doing, huh? Man, I'm trying to get Gavin and I hooked up. I'm actually doing something productive, okay? - Oh, productive my ass. - Oh my God. So how's that goin'? I think you're gonna be real happy with the treats I'm getting out there tonight. Ew, that's disgusting. Yeah, real happy. Seriously Jed, turn that damn thing off. - Jesus Christ. - Get off me, man. This is fucking bullshit, you guys always get pissed off- - Yeah, we'll be all right, we good. - But seriously... - What? Seriously, Jed? What? You started this shit already? Dude, I got plenty of battery to last us all night. Turn that fucking thing off. I'm not sure if that's what he meant, douche bag. I think it is, so don't worry about- - What's up, man? - We're the last ones. - Fuck. - How you doing? - I'm alright now. Think that guy's probably long gone. - So you're good to go? - Yeah, we good. I wouldn't worry about it Griff, okay. You know what would be great? If we'd start setting up the fire and the tents, because it's going to be dark soon. Well the good news is you've got the fire king here. Okay fire king, go do your job. Hey, Andrea, it'll be alright babe. We'll get it. Get the camera outta my face. I agree. Let's start getting this thing unloaded. Hey Griff, you brought your camera, right? Yeah, it's in the car. It's like half battery though. Okay, that's fine. I just wanted to make sure you brought it. So I heard you talking to Gavin, you doing okay? Yeah, I think I'm fine right now. Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it. They said like, I mean, you know... That guy's probably long gone, so you know, we're out here in the middle of nowhere. No one's gonna touch us. I wouldn't worry about it. So let's just get this thing unloaded. You guys need some help? Are you guys done yet? Hurry up. Look at these lazy asses. What the fuck do you mean hurry up? I'm not a lazy ass, I just don't know how to set up a tent. You brought chairs for yourselves. Duh. You can sit there. Yeah, probably for this motherfucker here. - What are you- - What are you doing? I'm just messing with the camera, I'll be- - Yeah you are. Dude, it'll be okay. It'll only take a... I mean, I'll set it down, okay? Here, I'll help you. What, you gonna help with one hand and fuckin' record with the other? We're not talking about fucking pleasuring your girlfriend. We're talking about setting up camp. Dude, fuck you, don't bring Andrea into this, you fucking dick. Oh my God, fuck you guys. You guys are fucking assholes. Whatever man, just start helping us. Just set up the tent, guys, God. - It's not that hard. - Oh, Jesus. Here, here, take- - You're grabbing the wrong one. Grab the right shit if you're gonna help us. Dude, no. We set this shit up every fucking time. Whatever, the last time we went- - All you guys have been doing is complain. The whole time we- - You know what, this is bullshit. You guys wanna relax? - You wanna relax? - Yeah, we do. Let's relax, here. How about you put your feet up, you like that? - Get the fuck back. - Dude. You little bitch. Hey, hey, stop. No, wait, no, wait, wait guys, come on. Stop fucking, come on.

Hope you got some good footage, douche bag. Alright let's just hurry up and get this fuckin' shit set up. Alright, you can do it. It's nice to actually get some alone time with you. Yeah, it's a good thing Tyler and Gavin left. They were getting annoying, quick. Yeah, something like that. Hey, I really wanted to apologize for being such a bitch lately. It's okay. They always bring out the worst in you. I know what to expect. And they have to go everywhere with us all the time and it just bothers me. It's not my choice. You invite them. They tag along, it's completely different. Right, right, whatever you say. Well hey, we're alone now so... Yeah, finally. I mean, Griffin and Haidee back there, doing whatever. I don't even wanna know. You always have that camera on. Hey, what- - Come on, superstar. You're always filming everyone else. Yeah, well... Come on, do something. - Okay, come here. - Don't... Maybe we should head back, come on. No come on, let's walk up a little further. Come on, let's walk up a little further. Griffin's not ready to come out just yet, for sure. It's okay, come on. Come here. He's probably freaking out. He probably thinks we've been killed or something. By this hobo. Don't say killed too loud, he'll hear you. In broad daylight, he's gonna come out with an ax, and then kill us or something? I don't know what the hell's taking him so long. I saw him pull up, I thought... Maybe I was wrong. They're probably getting the beer out, man. I think they went to get alcohol, didn't they? They're always getting drunk. Yeah, knowing those guys they'll both be carrying up that cooler. It'll be too heavy for 'em, they'll have so much beer in it. Yeah, it's just getting late. Oh man, at least we got a good fire going. Yeah baby, drinks all around guys. You guys need to quit being some pussies and drink up. Who wants a beer? - You wanna beer? - Oh yeah- - He wants a beer, how about you, and you, and you? Yeah, I'll take one. There's another one, right there. I knew I couldn't trust you guys giving me a beer. Dude, you're so fucking easy. You got it all the fuck over me, man. I tell you what man, this is already a good night for pranking. Oh my God. This is just getting started, Tyler. Hey, hey Griff, better you than me, buddy. You guys need to seriously grow up. So pathetic. I can't even stand to be around you guys. I'm gonna go get my cell phone. Haidee, will you go with me? Yeah I'll come with you. Alright, thanks for the beer, man.

So these girls that are coming out tonight, they're better than the last time, right? Dude, what the hell was wrong with last time? Are you serious? Hey Gavin, how about them girls last time? You're talking about Ginny and Bethany, right? I assume that's who's. Yeah, that's who I'm talking about. You're only talking' about girls cause Andrea left, Jed. Hey Griffin, stay out of this. Seriously Tyler, I'm sorry. But I really don't wanna talk about the girls from last time. What was wrong with the girls from last time? Dude seriously, okay. You take the bottom of the barrel, and then you knock out the bottom, alright? Really? Dude, all right I'm not saying bottom of the barrel or anything because I've been at the bottom of the barrel. But, I did have to change my cell phone number. Okay, okay, listen. No dude I'm telling you these girls... Okay, you had to drink 20 beers for them to look decent, alright? And you know what we do? We drink 21 beers. That's right, yes. - Listen, alright. - Anything that walks. Exactly. Those girls were a little psycho, I admit. But here's how I live my life. Oh, oh, just a little, huh? Sometimes you gotta fish, and you fish in that barrel. And sometimes you might catch the bottom of the barrel, and that pisses you off, but it's okay, because one day you're gonna catch the top of the barrel. And these girls are the top of the barrel, guaranteed. He is drunk, drunk, drunk. Hey, have you guys been drinking? - Hell yeah, we have. - A lot. What if the biggest fish is at the top of the barrel? Then we're gonna fuck that big fish. It's a big barrel. It's a big barrel. You guys drank way too much on the way here. You're lucky you didn't get caught. So where are those girls at? Dude, they're on their way. They're at work right now, they'll be here in a hour. Yeah, they don't exist. Don't you be talking shit because you know about your girlfriend, Jed. What the fuck do you mean by that? Like she ever fucking has to work. Dude, what- - You know the only reason she's with you is because of your fucking parents. Dude, don't talk shit, all right? It ain't even cool. Are you telling secrets? - Nothing. - Nothing. You guys shoulda heard what we heard on the radio. What's that? What Andrea, another fuckin' murder? Why are you always such a jackass? They said they have a suspect, he's in custody right now. Supposed to be some hobo, walking this side of town. Hey Griff, does that make you feel a little bit better? Well, if he's in custody I- - Boogeyman's not gonna get you tonight. No boogieman. So Tyler, back to what we were talking about... About the girls. I'm done talking about these girls. Are you that ashamed of them? You have to judge when you see them. Oh okay, I'll judge. Andrea, are you gonna let him talk about girls? Dude, when are they coming? It is on, alright? They will be here in an hour, it is on. These girls are gonna be here. I'll bet they have STDs. Are they classy? - Ask Gavin. - They're way classy. You girls, don't put that fucking voodoo on us, alright? That voodoo was already put on you the last time you guys brought out girls. Man whatever, you know what, I'm done talking about this subject. Subject changed now, seriously. Hey, I've got a good subject change. - Oh, great. - Yeah. They said they found the killer. Let's go check that house out. You're crazy. I think it sounds like a good idea. Gavin, are you serious? Yeah Jed, let's go check it out. Why would we check it out? Fuck no. What's the purpose of it? We saw it today. Dude, think about it. I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking it's pretty fucking dumb. A fuckin' murder that happened in this fuckin' small town, a little over a mile from here. So? You talk about your fucking ghost stories and something, this is a real life ghost story, man. Dude, fuck no, man. Seriously, I came out here, I'm not going back to that house. Hey whoa, you know what man? Listen, alright, you have our word, all right? It's gonna be okay. Hey Andrea, what do you think? It does sound kinda fun. - Come on, Jed. - Seriously? Okay, if I go I'll go on one condition. That's I bring my camera and you can't say a fucking word about it. Cause you been giving me shit all day. I apologize for that. I promise I won't say anything about it. Oh, I apologize. You can hate your real life fuckin' ghost story shit in there. Because I got you on record right now. You'll have more fucking fun looking for ghosts with us. Fuck that shit, true, true. Dude, you can fucking stay here if you want. You know what, you can sleep in these tents with the fucking rest of the fucking hobos asleep out here tonight. Oh you hear that? Does that sound fun to you, Haidee? I think he's right there, you can do that. You know you guys are gonna do something stupid, fuck up and get us caught, like you always do, they are. - Nah man. - Haidee, you wanna go? Griff, this is serious stuff dude, they won't do it. No, Haidee, you wanna go? I dunno, I kinda don't. Really? So Griffin, are you gonna listen to her the rest of your fucking life? I didn't wanna go either. She doesn't wanna go, so you're gonna listen to her the rest of your fucking life? That's two, not-wanna-goes then. Doesn't matter. Stop being a pussy, and take initiative for once. You gotta bring your camera, man. Dude come on, I need another guy. You guys promise me you're not gonna do anything stupid to get us caught, and I'll think about it. You've got to think about it? Promise? - Yeah, fucking promise - We promise, man. Yeah. - So let's do it. - Let's do it. - Alright, let's go. - Let's fucking go. Let's load up and go. We're taking the beer, man. Let's go, come on, come on, let's go. Andrea, come on. Let's go, come on. I'm telling you... This is a bad idea. This is fucking crazy. Full moon tonight, werewolves are out. Where'd you guys park at? We're down here somewhere. Down here somewhere. We weren't exactly sober when we were driving. Man, I am so glad we brought the alcohol for this trip. You guys have a problem. I think every time we hang out you guys are drunk, always. There's nothing wrong with drinking, Andrea. No kidding, wait for these girls to get out here. We'll show you what drinking is. Oh, so there'll be drunken skanks hanging out with us? Wait, wait, hang on, hang on, wait, wait. Gavin, where are we going? Shortcut. This is not a shortcut, this is the wrong way. I agreed to go to the house with you guys so take me to the house. You know what? Gavin, let's go back to the damn- - Yeah, you gotta turn around. Let's just go back. Gavin, if you're gonna pull this shit, we're just gonna go back to the campsite, alright? I'm tired of messing around, okay? Man, these guys are being such pussies. Tyler, lay the fuck off, okay? We did not agree to do this shit, okay? We should go ahead and turn around. You know what I mean, turn around. That's not even funny, that's not funny. Yeah, yeah, yeah funny. - What are you doing? - Gavin... What the hell are you doing, dude? Chinese fire drill. No, we're not doing a Chinese fire drill. You guys... Griffin, you lose your glasses? Yeah, shit. They're right there, fucking assholes. What the hell are they doing out there? Come on, bitch. Got the camera. Gimme my fucking camera back, give it back. Give it back, okay? You keep pulling this shit. Got a text message. Gavin, give it back, now. Uh-oh, it's a picture message. I'm tired of this. - What Andrea? - Check this out. Give him his camera back. Are you going to let her fight your battles for you, man? You know what Gavin, fuck you, okay? - Check this out. - Who's that? No, give me my motherfucking- - That's Stacey, man. Dude, fucking stop, all right, dammit. Whatever man, why you gotta be such a pussy? Dude, I'm not a fucking pussy, okay? You guys just need to grow the fuck up, okay? I'm just tired of it, just stop, okay? What's that, shots on the hood? - Shots on the hood? - Shots on the hood? Shots on the hood. No, we are not doing shots on the hood, come on. Turn around. You're gonna get the fuckin' cops called on us. Okay, come on. Jed, you will love it most. Dude, I'm not fucking- - How many, how many? - No, stop. None, really, seriously? Just 'cause they're not taking them? Gavin, stop. You two used to be the most fun people to hang out with. And then these two came along, what up? Those girls will be much more fun than you two. Because they're nasty, Yes they are, they're awesome. Just because we're not playing your old fucking drinking games guys. Just get in the fucking car. Come on, stop- - This is not fun. Come on Jed, shots on the hood. - No, we're not- - Tradition, man. Traditions change, people grow up. Unlike you guys. Yeah well, we still know how to have fun. Get back in the fucking car. Let's go back in the fucking car. Let's go, come on. - So stupid. - Hurry up. Okay, are we done? Can we go now? Road tripping? Let's continue our road trip. You guys keep pulling that shit, I'm not... Was that seriously necessary, you guys? You wanna shut your fucking door? Well I'm locking, fucking... We're turning around. Of course it was necessary. Right. Taking shots on the hood's a tradition. No shit. We've done that every time we stopped, until you fucking girls came along. Yeah, now Jed's just a pussy. Gavin, that's beside the- Fuck you, Tyler. Hey Gavin, that's besides the point, okay? You've had way, way- Look at that, you even turned on your window wipers. You've had way too much to drink tonight. You know we'll be okay. Always are. Yeah well, one of these times is gonna bite you in the fucking ass, all right? You guys probably won't even remember the girls that come over tonight. Guarantee we remember. As a good friend, here's something I'm going to do for you, okay? When the girls come over, I'll take pictures of them. So when you wake up in the morning, you can realize how ugly they are. All I'm gonna say is 10 and two, that's it, 10 and two. What the hell's 10 and two? At 10 o'clock the girl looks like a two, but by two o'clock she looks like a 10. That's how all your girls are. That's like hitting the nail on the head right there. Let me just inform you this. Okay, inform me. You got the camera on me? Yeah, the camera's rolling. These girls are way hotter than any girl you've ever dated, Jed. No offense, Andrea. Oh, whatever Tyler. Well, I'm pretty sure that every girl that you guys bring over will never be as hot as Haidee and I, fuck that. Yeah, we'll see about that. We will see. Oh look, guess who's calling. - Skanks. - They're home already? I don't know, we'll find out. We have to go back early though. Thank God. Hello? Hey, what's up? You girls off work yet? Oh okay, you got another hour? Do you guys wanna place bets on how ugly they are? They're pretty ugly, I can tell. You're lucky I promised you could have that camera because that light's about to piss me off. You know what, fuck you Gavin. Hey Gavin by the way... Yeah, cause we bought the whole store. Who says we bought anything? That's wrong. Hey Gavin, I guarantee you that you guys will be passed out by the time they get there. - Bullshit. - I guarantee it. We're in it for the long haul. Oh long haul, yeah. Just cause you have all the alcohol doesn't mean- - Well, I guess when they come out I'll believe it. But I doubt they'll make it out there. Because you guys will be... Your phones will be blowing up all night long like, hey, where are you guys at? Are you guys gonna take- You're gonna be passed out in the tent. I just wanna know if the girls are going to show up in like hooker heels and mini skirts. - We only hope. - We hope so. Wow. That's exactly why we call them skanks. Yes. They're not skanks, they're classy. Classy ladies. I'd like to say, if you can't get it easy then get it sleazy. That's disgusting. Okay Tyler, where do you even meet these girls? I'm just curious, do you find them online? I wouldn't meet them online. Oh, whatever. - Dude. - What? Met them randomly at this bar I was at, you know? Hey Gavin. Where are you going? Gavin, we are not doing this again, are you serious? Gavin. You two want to come in and have a seat? Okay. Do you know how long this is gonna be? The detective will be in shortly. I hope this doesn't take all day. I don't even know why I'm here. It's not like I met them. Hello, Detective Hoffee with Lawford County Sheriff's Department. Okay, please state your name for the record. Stacey Hill. Nikki Allen. Thank you, so- - So why are we even here? I'm sure you're both aware why you're here. Not really. Nikki, shut up. Both of you are persons of interest in the disappearance of Tyler Brian, Gavin Landers, amongst some others. Look, I've never even met them before. Stacey set this whole thing up. Nikki please stop. According to the text message and phone records, it shows you both were supposed to meet them after you got off work. This makes you the last people to hear from them. Can you tell me what time you last spoke with them? I talked to Tyler on the phone around 9:30. Yeah, on the 23rd. And like I said, I've never even talked to them before. Ms. Allen, just calm down. Thank you, Ms. Hill. Can you tell me what was the nature of the conversation you had with Tyler? We talked about when we were getting off work and where we were going to meet. Did they say anything about having you meet them at the murder house? No, nothing like that. We didn't even know they were going there. After I talked to Tyler on my break, I never heard back from him. What made you go to the campsite when you heard nothing back? They sent us directions earlier. So we decided to go anyway. Figured his phone had died or lost service. What did you see when you arrived? Well, they basically stood us up and they left the campfire going. Who even does that? Okay, besides the campfire was anything else out of the ordinary? There was a car, but no one was around. How long did you stay? About 30 minutes. We left when no one showed and we did put the fire out. And after you left, did you hear from Tyler? Like I said, not a word. Where did you go after you left the campsite? Well, I made her take me home after that waste of a night. This is the last time I let you talk me into that stupid blind date shit again. Will you please just shut up? I shouldn't even be here. I should be at home right now I'm here because of you. You didn't have to go. This is the last time I let you talk me into this crappy game. Okay, okay, okay. Let's just pause for a second. Okay now Nikki I know you say you never met Tyler or Gavin, but what was your relationship with Thomas Colton? I'm not answering any more questions. I'd like my lawyer. Gavin, dude, where they hell are you taking us man? This is not the right road. You'll see. This is some bullshit. Chill out. Seriously, you guys need to calm down because you are gonna like this. - Tyler. - Right. And guess what? If you don't like it, y'all can just walk home. Let me just tell you this, I would not wanna walk home. Not out here. I heard that man, not with all those hillbilly buttfuckers that walk around, know what I'm saying? Really, come on. Gavin, just pull over so I can drive, alright? Hey, we're almost there. We're almost where? You're not even telling us anything. Just pull over I'll take us back to the campsite, okay? Your girls are coming anyway, so just pull over. Gavin. Dude, we're really close. I don't care if we're really close or really far away, just pull over, okay? And quit drinking dammit, gosh. Seriously. You guys need to grow up, okay? We're not in fucking high school anymore, all right? You're not invincible. I liked the girls in high school. Hey whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, get out. We're here. - Where's here? - This is not the house. Why are we stopped in the middle of bum fuck nowhere? Well no shit, Haidee, this is not the house. Tyler, what the fuck man? You're always all up on Haidee and me. What about Jed and Andrea? Hey, you know what, Griffin? Why don't you quit- - Not again, not this shit. Stop, Tyler. Fuck man, we're all friends here. Bullshit. Gavin, let's just go, okay. I'm tired of dealing with this shit tonight. No, we've got something to do here. What do we have to do? Where are we even at? We gotta check out Thomas Colton's grave. You've gotta be kidding me. Who the hell is Thomas Colton? You don't remember? Seriously, man. The douchebag at the house that told us about the guy. You mean Tanner? Yeah, whatever his name is. You mean the story about the whole fucking- - That's disgusting. Oh my God. You mean the whole story about the people in the basement being burnt? Yeah, that one. How do you know this is even the right graveyard? We were in the house earlier and Tyler and I did some asking around and found out that the person that owned it before, Mr. Thomas Colton, AKA Tanner's Tom is buried right here in this cemetery. Yeah, but you guys were saying the story's bullshit. We're about to go find out. We're about to go find out if he's here. No, let's just go. Let's go back to the campsite. You know I was all for going and seeing the house, checking it out, but I am not going out into the graveyard in the middle of the night. That's where I draw the line. Would you rather sit in a car in a graveyard in the middle of the night? 'Cause, we're taking the keys. No man, no. Don't fuck with me. Dude, gimme the keys back. - Get back in the car. - I wanna go back. Hey, you know what? The only way we're gonna be leaving right now is if one of you guys go with us. Who's it gonna be? - I'm not going. - I'm not going either. Gavin, get in this car, now. Let's go, one person, go with us, come on. You guys can make that decision. Gavin, come on. Jed, you're gonna have to go. - Just go. - Please? The sooner you go and do whatever they wanna do- - Fine. The sooner we get to leave. Come on guys, this isn't cool. Gavin, Tyler, come on guys. Oh man. Did you guys seriously go in the cemetery? Gavin, Tyler, come on guys. This isn't cool. Oh, man. Guys, I'm seriously- I just wanna leave. Oh, man. Guys? Come on dude, I don't wanna be in a graveyard after hours and us get caught, okay? 'Cause we'll be in so much, I mean... This could be bad. Let's just go, come on. Guys? Dude, this isn't even cool guys. I would never do anything like this to you, come on. Come on, come on. Guys? I'm gonna count to three, okay? One. Two. Hey. I'll make you wish you were dead, boy. Gavin Like a little colt on the ground, man. Look at him. You alright Jed? No dude, that's not even cool, alright? Let's just go, okay? Let's go. What's so funny? No, come on, dude. Let's go back to the car. I'm tired of this, let's go. No man, we found something. You gotta check this out. No, what'd you find? We found the grave. There's no way you found it already. Let's go back to the car, come on. - No man, over here. - Over here, man. Guys? Dude, I'm gonna go back, alright? Come on. Hey man, come check this out. And then you can go back. - What? - What, man? No, no, no did you guys just hear that? Hear what? No seriously dude, something happened. Dude, did you not just hear that? No. Dude, the thing just came right at me. I don't know what it was. It just came right at me. There's nothing out here. No, there was something. Dude, just come take a look at this grave and stop being a pussy. Dude, my battery's dying. I just wanna go back to the car. Well then hurry the heck up. What? Some fucking camera operator man you are. Can't even keep damn battery in that thing. I just put a new one in, okay? So lay off. Well then let's go back up there. No, let's go. We're not going up there again- - You guys keep messing around then your girls are going to show up at the campsite before you even get back. Ooh, she does finally have a point. Let's just go, come on. Let's just fucking leave. Tyler, shut up. All right, I guess we'll go. Let's go. To the house, finally. - Oh dude. - This is crazy. I can't believe we're fucking doing this. Shh. Don't shut your door loud. Okay? Okay. Guys, this is a terrible idea. We shouldn't do this. Griffin, shut up man. It's fine, alright? Dude, we can't do this. Dude. Let's just go in. It's gonna be fun. We're not gonna get in trouble, okay? Alright, let's go. Let's go check this shit out. Whoa, whoa, shit dude. What? I think it's a fucking cop. There's a fucking cop still here. We're definitely gonna get in trouble. Yeah, that is definitely a cop car. Guys, we can get donuts. Guys, I'm dead serious I just got- Griffin, fucking get down dude. We can't do this. Yes we can. Let's just go back. Let's just go back to the campsite. It's freezing out here. We're already here. I mean- - Well, what are we gonna do? We can't sneak around him. I mean, no way. Let's go through the back. No, we can't go round back, he'll catch us. Let's call in a prank call. Dude, are you fucking- - No. - No. Dude, I guarantee it'll fuckin' work. No dude, fucking bad idea. It could work. Is there any other way around this pig? Dude, I don't think so. Dude, let's just go I like Griffin's idea. Let's just go back to the fucking place, okay? But we came here to check it out, we might as well go in. There's a cop, do you want to go to fucking jail? I don't, I really don't want to go there. God, that is fuckin' stupid. Let's just, let's leave. Yeah, I'd like to report a break in at Finley's Machine and Welding Shop on Christie Avenue. Dude, shut the fuck up. Get off the phone. Yeah, I drove by earlier and there was a guy, broke the glass, entered the building. No. Yeah, yeah on Christie Avenue. Gavin, no. All right, thank you. Thank you officer, bye. Are you fucking serious, dude? You know how much trouble we're gonna get in? Shut up dude, watch this. What the fuck, oh my God. No fucking way. Hey, what'd I tell you guys? I don't wanna go to jail for this. No, we are not fucking, no. You guys are being crazy. Are you fucking stupid, dude? You know how much trouble we're fucking in? Fuck you guys, what excuse do you have now, Jed? Look, we got the house, this is what we came for. How about going to jail? That's a fucking good enough excuse for me. The cop is not here, so how could we go to jail? Oh my God. He's gonna come back eventually. I'm not doing anything stupid, getting in trouble and going to jail. Dude, fuck this shit, Gavin. Let's go, come on. Dude, Gavin? Where are you fucking going Gavin? Gavin, get your fucking ass back here. Wait up, wait up. What the fuck? Gosh dang it, Gavin. Gavin, get your fucking ass- - Gavin, come back. - Gavin. - Gavin. Is he seriously going inside? Oh my God, are you fucking serious? Gavin? Dude, where in the fuck is he? Dude. I'm ready to go, Jed. Do you actually think he went inside, man? Fuck, I hope not. Hey man, you gotta come see this. Dude Tyler, what the hell are you doing? - What is it? - This better be good. Did you find him? What the fuck is going on here? I guarantee you that they're doing something. Yeah, you know they're gonna be playing with us. The door is open. Oh my God. And the other door inside is open. We're not going in. Did you fucking open that dude? I didn't open this, Gavin just went in there, has to be. Do you know where he is. Come on. I don't know where he's at, this is not me. This is Gavin being Gavin right now. You're in on it, you have to be. I'm not in on it. This is his stupid shit. And he's in there right now at a crime scene. We need to go get him. We're not gonna get him. We're gonna get in so much trouble. Griffin, Griffin, Griffin. First of all, what if that cop comes back? And second of all, he went in there by himself. Let him come out by himself. Exactly. We can't leave somebody behind like that. Let's just go in, get- - Griffin he gets caught, we're all fucked, alright? What if the killer's still in there? He probably could be. Man, there's no killer. Dude, they caught the fucking guy. Let's just go in, alright? It'll take like a couple of- - I don't wanna go in. It'll just take a few seconds, pop in real quick. Let's get him, come on. Okay, can we go in, and then we come out. We gotta stick together, alright guys? Alright, it's fine, let's go.

Come on guys, let's get the fuck outta here. No, we gotta go up there and we gotta make sure everybody's okay. Dude, no- - Dude, someone has to be up there.

Dude, if they are fucking with us, we're going to be in so much shit you have no- - I don't even buy that right now. Andrea, I don't even fucking care right now.

Just check those windows over there or something okay? Dammit, they're all bolted shut. Hey calm down, it'll be okay, God. It's not gonna be okay. I promise it will. Oh, there's sleeping bags. It's kinda eerie to think the last people that slept in these are dead now. Yeah, real weird. Hey, go check in that room over there, see if there's a window or something.

What we need to do is go back downstairs, let Griffin bust open the damn window so we can get the hell out of here. Andrea, we've talked about this time and time again. I'm telling you Gavin and Tyler are the ones behind this and they're upstairs. They're not behind this. Okay, if anything, we can maybe find a window to open. So come on, you're coming. - This is so stupid. - Let's go. All right, You can call it stupid all you want, but I guarantee you Tyler and Gavin are up here. I guarantee they're not up here. Tyler, Gavin, come out. I know you're up here hiding somewhere. I told you. All right, See those windows over there, Go over there and open that one. I'm gonna open this one.

It's our first house. Honey, I can't believe we did it. Oh my God, honey. It's freaking' huge. Oh my God. It's our first house. It's huge, I mean it's huge. It is huge. Oh, go over by the sign. Oh, yes. - It's ours. - It is. Oh my God, okay come on in, come on in. We gotta go in. This is amazing. Oh my God, there's so many things I can't wait to do in the dining room. Honey, look at this porch. You haven't even went inside yet and you're still- - It's ours. Here, get us a shot you and I. Our first house. And I love the porch. It wraps all the way around. Yeah, it's huge, it is a very huge house. Wow. Oh honey, look. Alright, let's go in, let's go in, I can't wait. Here it is. Oh my gosh. So I think that that red couch we have is going right there, honey. Big front room. I love the fireplace. I love the mantle. And I think it'll look really good with like the red brick, and that one painting we have is going right there. Yeah, the red and orange one? Let's go, yes. Let's go and see upstairs. Kitchen. Moving on. Oh, look at the staircase. Oh, I love it. I think everything is basically still original in this house, which is cool. It's really cool. So I definitely feel that this could be the master. I thought we agreed that I was going to be on this floor and then the master is gonna be upstairs. No, no, I definitely think this will be the master, and I think we could do, your den upstairs because I love the fireplace. I love the mirror and I like all of that. Plus, darling, honey... Look how it connects to a perfect first baby's room. There's another one over there. I know, and we can wrap around so it'll be both sides. And I love how the window goes... How the glass goes all the way down. And it lets in so much. I mean, there's so many things I'm thinking. Okay, let's go I want to check out the upstairs. Alright. Okay, all right I'll let you go first. I think we just blew a breaker. Oh, man. The breaker box is in the basement, right? - I think so. - Alright. Let's go down and find that, then. Okay.

This year for the month of October, I wanted to do something a little different since I won't be traveling. It's nothing bad I promise. So from now to Halloween, I'll be naming off my bucket list of haunted places I want to visit. So my first pick is the Owner House in Lawford County, Illinois. I've always been so intrigued by not only the murders and disappearances that happened there, but this beautiful house. Ugh, I love it. Out of all the places on my list this October, this one I will be seeing in person, hopefully by next October. So at the end of the video, be sure to subscribe and hit that donate button and help me get this trip funded. Now we will dive right into this for you. But first, a word from our sponsor. Well folks, it's that time of the year again. Alien Nation Sci-Fi Convention is coming back to the Elliot Lake Arena. Come meet your favorite B movie stars, talk to a few conspiracy theorists, and for the first time ever, you'll be able to lay your eyes on the personal spoon collection of convicted killer Stabs McGee.
