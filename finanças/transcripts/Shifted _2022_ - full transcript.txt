They used to be people, now they are something else. (dramatic suspenseful music) Let me stress, the danger is real. There are monsters in the world. 47 countries- - You married a bum. - I know, Ma. (newscaster chattering faintly) He goes to work, he comes home, he goes to work. Playing with these little screwdrivers. Never says a fucking word. Fixing shit we don't even need, what is this shit? (metal clanks) - Back. Ladies and gentlemen, be advised, the following images may be disturbing for younger viewers. (sirens wailing) (crowd yelling) (suspenseful music) - Devil knows what's going on inside that head of his. - I married a piece of furniture. I coulda married Rocco, instead I got the invisible fucking man. - (scoffs) I told you, - With this shift in behavior, these creatures are - a leopard never changes this spots. - no longer your loved ones. These are not your friends - What you need is a real man. - and family, communication is impossible. - I warned you, I warned you before you - Ladies and gentlemen, I'm telling you now, - ever married him. - Yeah, I know, Ma. - I'm urging you, no, I'm begging you, - You always think you know better, huh? - stay inside, lock your doors, keep your families safe! (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) - (exhales sharply) You know Ma's right, I need a real man. (gentle suspenseful music) I need to tell you something else. I'm leaving you for Rocco. I've been fucking that man on our bed for the past two years. I spoke to the lawyer, he says that I can get half. (laughs) Quite frankly, I think I deserve it. What do you gotta say to that, huh? Nothing. You never say a fucking word. I'd fuck anything but you, babe. - I never really liked you. (suspenseful music) (plate jangling) (body thuds) (monsters growling) (flesh squelching) (both grunting) (Clara coughing) (Derek grunting) (flesh squelching) (Clara groaning) Not so invisible now, am I? (Clara coughing) (Derek grunts) (flesh squelching) (Derek chuckles) (dramatic music) (wind whistling) (monsters growling) (wind whistling continues) (monsters growling) (chime clinking) (chime continues clinking) - No one is going to save us. We're fucked. I should be on fucking vacation. How many weeks have we been sitting in our own piss and shit? Three? Four? And the air in here, it doesn't move. It's so quiet. All of us are just staring at the fucking walls. Don't you just wanna scream? Back off, Jimmy, (suspenseful music) 'cause I'll cut you and there's no one around to patch you up. I cannot take the cold and the quiet anymore. (door squeaking) I am not dying in this house with you. Cindy, fuck you. (suspenseful music continues) (door clicks) (suspenseful music) (lock clicking) (Sid shrieking) (monsters growling) (door thuds) (Jimmy grunts) (Sid shrieking) (monsters growling) (bones crunching) (flesh squelching) (crows cawing) (footsteps crunching) (suspenseful music) (crow cawing) (monsters growling) (crows cawing) (monsters growling) (monsters growling) (gentle suspenseful music) (monsters growling) (gentle suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (gentle suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) - If you break the rules again, I'll have to do something. - Zeke's dead. (gentle suspenseful music) (footsteps plodding) (dramatic music) - Goddammit. (gentle suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music continues) - [Frankie] Well, (sighs) one less mouth to feed. - Frankie! - We're all thinking it. - He didn't seem, I just didn't think that he would- - Yeah, well, he did. - [Becka] He left the house last night. - What were you doing upstairs at night? - I couldn't sleep. Where are you going? - Um, I'm coming back. - No, you're not. But I guess I'm okay with that. - You know, none of us are gonna get a pretty little tombstone, we're all gonna be scattered in pieces along the side of the road. - You first. - (breathing heavily) If I don't make it back, tell Jimmy to go fuck himself. (breathes heavily) (sliding door creaks) (suspenseful music) - [Jimmy] Those rules are in place for all of us. - [Derek] Yeah, why didn't you say anything? - Listen, I know you all think I owe you an explanation, but to me, you're all a bunch of fucking strangers living in my house. - Good riddance. - Watch your mouth. - He was a thief. I caught him going through my things. - You should have said something. - You should be in your own home, eating your own food, drinking your own water. - You know, this is how it's gonna be until the end. You all know that, right? - You're wrong. - It's an invasion. Have, have you looked outside? - Derek, who's doing what today? - Lauren is on lookout. Frankie, you're on the bucket today, sorry. Cindy is laundry, and Becka's on water. - The bathtub is three quarters full, we don't need water. She doesn't need to go outside. - Everybody gets a turn, today is yours, but don't fret, little lady, we'll do it the same as we've done the last two weeks, signals and safety by the numbers. - Jimmy, it's your turn to check the radio today and I'll do inventory. - I'll save you some time, there are five cans of food left and six of us, by the numbers. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (wind whistling) (monsters growling and howling) (footsteps crunching) (monsters growling and howling) - Morning, (gentle suspenseful music) Hannah. (gentle suspenseful music continues) - By the looks of things, Jimmy, we're gonna run out of batteries around the same time we run out of food. - Like rats stuck on a sinking ship. What's our play here, Derek? - (exhales sharply) There's only one thing we can do, we need to leave the house. - Yeah, but we can't do that. - [Derek] I know. (object clatters) (pen scratching) (Jimmy exhales sharply) - We are not dying here sitting on our hands. (Jimmy exhales sharply) Sunday. Sunday, we are outta here. (wind whistling) (suspenseful music) (monsters howling) (footsteps crunching) (suspenseful music continues) (monsters howling) (monsters howling) Let's do this. (sighs) - [Becka] Thanks. Sorry. - [Frankie] (exhales sharply) Goddammit. (Cindy sobbing) (Cindy continues sobbing) - Frankie, she's too loud. - Well, she just lost her husband. - I'm crying. None of us has anything left. She's being too damn loud. - Jimmy, you can't save us from everything. (grunts) - If she doesn't shut her mouth, I'm gonna shut it for her. - You're the boss. - Damn right. (monsters growling) (footsteps crunching) (monsters continue growling) (footsteps crunching) (gentle suspenseful music) - Do they ever stop? (monsters growling and howling) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (monster howls) (torches clicking) (torch clicking) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (Frankie breathes heavily) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) - Becka, Becka. (suspenseful music) (monsters growling and howling) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) (twig crunches) (monster howls) They're coming. (dramatic suspenseful music) - It's locked. (shrieks) - What do you mean it's locked? (knocking on door) - I can't open it. - Open the door! (monsters growling) (door thuds) (monsters tapping) (monsters growling) - Are you okay? - The door was locked. - It was a mistake. - Big fucking mistake. I thought you were trying to kill us. - (exhales sharply) One of them looks like my, my fifth grade teacher. - It wasn't your fifth grade teacher, it was Robert Jeffries. We called him Bob, and he kept an impeccable lawn. (scoffs) Woulda make me jealous if I gave a shit. - Did you see those things coming out of them? Why didn't we change? - I don't know. We haven't been bit and turned like vampires or zombies. - There must be something about us. - Or maybe we do something in common that makes us immune. - Immune, like, like it's a virus. - Like from monkeys or dead pigs, come on. - Whatever it is, it was cooked up in a lab somewhere. Or it's from outer space. - Oh, what does it matter? It's a slaughter. - I wasn't feeling well. I needed to go to the washroom. - Becka and Frankie nearly died. - It, it wasn't my fault. - I'm over it. (footsteps plodding) (Cindy exhales sharply) (gentle suspenseful music) (Cindy sighs) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) (wind whooshing) - There's a man coming to the door. - It's not possible. - I think he's bleeding. (door crunching) (suspenseful music) (furniture scraping) - I can't let him in this house. - I will hurt you. I will shoot you in the face if you fuck with me. Nod if you understand. Put your knives down. (knives clanking) (gentle suspenseful music) Old man, over there. Little girl, go get everyone else in the house. (gentle suspenseful music) (crows cawing) (monsters growling) (footsteps crunching) This is everyone? - Yeah. - Is that all of it? - That's everything. (William sighs) - [William] You're fucked. (tins clanking) - What's that for? - I'm tired. I just need some sleep and I need to stop bleeding, and then I'll be outta your hair. - What happened? - One of those fucking things bit me. - If you turn, we'll kill you. - (exhales sharply) Listen, sweetheart, getting bit by one of those things does not turn you. - What's it like out there? (William sighs) - Every day there's more of them and there's less of us. We're not coming back from this. - Have you been outside this whole time? - Yeah, it's all gone to shit out there. I don't know where it begins or where it ends. - We've been waiting for someone to arrive. The army, the government, the police, anyone. - [Derek] How do you move around out there? - I knew you were lying. - How do you just walk around outside? - I will give you that piece of intel after I leave. You're gonna need it. Get over there. I'm gonna take a room upstairs with a lock on it. - The master bedroom. - It's where my husband and I used to sleep. - [William] I don't give a shit. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music) (Cindy chattering faintly) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) - Um, I need you to lock the door, something's happening. - Did you invite your brother? - No. - What's your name? - Bill. Bill Winter. - I'm Jimmy. Thanks for the food, we appreciate it, (exhales sharply) we need it. But understand, if you stay between the lines, we'll stay between the lines. If you don't, we won't. - That's the last time you threaten me, Jimmy. (dramatic suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (torch clicking) (paper rustling) (Lauren speaking faintly) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music) (Lauren exhales sharply) (monsters growling) (Hannah panting) (crow cawing) (Hannah grunting) (Dr. Charles screaming) (flesh squelching) (Lauren grunting) (Lauren grunting) (Lauren and Hannah panting) (crows cawing) - I don't know why he did it. - (clears throat) Well, maybe it was because he knew your baby wasn't his. (gentle suspenseful music) - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about your affair with my husband. (Cindy exhales sharply) (gentle suspenseful music) - You told him. - [Becka] I couldn't stand to look at his stupid face anymore, he deserved to know the truth. - My husband is dead because of you. - Well, then maybe you should have kept your secret better. - You had to kill somebody just to lash out at me. And that look on your face. You don't even give a shit. - You're right. - You're disgusting. - Mm-hmm, I don't care. You did this when you opened your legs to Rob. - Oh, Rob was going to leave you. - [Becka] You're lying. - He had the divorce papers drawn up. They're in this house somewhere. You know that your relationship changed, right? You know that he hated you. Maybe things would've been different if you'd been brave enough to save him and Hayden. (hand thuds) (Cindy exhales sharply) What kind of mother- (hand thuds) (Cindy grunts) (Cindy breathes heavily) The next time you touch me will be the last thing you ever do. (suspenseful music) - Dinnertime. (water burbling) - Everyone, this is Hannah. Lauren invited her over. Should we, uh, say grace or something? Yeah, I didn't think so. So how long have you been out there, Hannah? - Doesn't matter. - It matters because I don't trust you. None of us do. And we want some answers. How long? - Since the beginning. Three weeks. - [Derek] So was that your dad? - Yeah. Can I have some beans, please? - [Cindy] You don't seem too broken up about it. - What are you gonna do when the baby cries and screams all night? You're a walking time bomb. - One problem at a time. - [Jimmy] He didn't really seem like your type. - His name was Ken Charles. He was a doctor I think. Were you a patient? - We traded services. He got my medication and I sucked his dick. Can I please have some fucking beans because I haven't eaten in three days? - Keep it down! - Fuck you. - Yeah, sure. Maybe you and I could trade services, hmm? (gentle suspenseful music) - Give her the fucking beans. - Lauren, take her up to Zeke's room. The toilet is a bucket downstairs and we have rules, disobey them and you'll find yourself outside. - I know guys just like you. You think you got everything under control, but you're just like the rest of us, scared. - What was the medication for? (knocking on door) - [William] Come on in. - Would you mind if I sit? - Sure. - (stammers) Do you prefer Bill or William? - My friends call me Winter. - All right. (sighs) Look, you could save us. We need to leave here by Sunday. You know how to survive out there. Please, take us with you. - I got a job to do. Besides, you don't wanna leave, the wind coming through the trees distracts those things. You have plenty of water. You can pillage the neighborhood for food. Just stay away from that Acorp crap 'cause that'll kill you faster than those things. - So you're not much of a company man, layoffs or? - I just needed a paycheck when the farm couldn't give me one. - A farmer. I only ever bought local. - [William] Well, you're one of the few. What's your story anyway? (monster growling) (Denise shrieking) (flesh squelching) - No, no, no. (shrieks) (baby crying) (monster growling) - And I ran 'till I ended up here, just like everybody else. - (clears throat) If you can move around out there, how'd you get bitten? - I wasn't paying attention. Forgot where I was. - So it's not an all access pass then? - What do you want from me, asshole? You've done good here. It looks like you got what you need, lots of water. - That was Derek, he filled up every container in the house before the hydro went off. Saw the writing on the wall or whatever. - It just seemed like the right thing to do at the time. I didn't think you noticed. - Well, I did. So thank you. - Well, it looks like you saved everyone in the house. I'll drink to that, so will you. Here. To those of us left. (glass clinks) - To those of us left. - I mean, you realize the ax has already fallen, we're just waiting for the heads to stop rolling. (gentle suspenseful music) - I wanna say something. Hannah is your responsibility. If she's a bad apple, you're taking her heat. - [Lauren] Sure, Jimmy. - Now, listen, (sighs) look, I know that, that I can be a hard bastard sometimes, but if you ever need anything at all, I'm here. It's you and me, kid. (exhales sharply) We have the best chance. (gentle suspenseful music continues) Good girl. (gentle suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music) (Zeke groans) - We left Mom! - Yeah. - Fuck! Ah! - Listen, listen to me, it's you and me now, kid. - Ah. - Ah, run, run! (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) Where's Cindy? - Sleeping? - There are two new people in the house, people we don't know. - [Derek] We need Winter's help. - [Lauren] What? - Winter, he likes to be called Winter. - [Lauren] Are you two best buds now? - We had a conversation. - About what? - [Derek] About survival. He knows how to survive out there. - Yeah, but can we trust him? - I think we have to. He can help us and we need to leave here soon. - And what about Hannah? - I don't trust her. - I have to agree. - What are we supposed to do, push her out the front door? - [Frankie] Well, we never should have let her in in the first place. - She's my friend. - You barely know her. She could be insane for all we know. What happens to us when things go south? - You haven't even given her a chance. - We have to be careful. This is about survival now. - She's just another mouth to feed. - She's been through a lot too. Just like each of us. (breathes heavily) I can't believe you guys. - (breathes heavily) Three shifts tonight. Frankie first, then Derek. I'll take the tough last one. (pen scratching) (gentle suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music continues) - What are you writing? - Just, uh, recording of events. - Maybe someone will find it someday, you know? Like, Anne Frank's diary or something. I don't know, it's stupid. - No, it's genius. Did you write about me? - Mm-hmm, about you, about everyone. - What did you write about me? - That you mostly kept to yourself. That you didn't seem too upset when your wife died. - People mourn in different ways. She didn't treat me very well. (suspenseful music) (Frankie sighs) - You got this? - Yeah. (footsteps plodding) (gentle suspenseful music) - You can't talk to me like that. I could eat everything, if I fucking wanted to eat everything, I'd eat everything. No one ever talks to me like that. The next person who talks to me, they're gonna live to regret it. Who does he think he is? Can't talk to me like that. I would, I would kill him if he ever talked to me like that again. (footsteps plodding) - How's it going? - Fine. I'm not so sure about her though. - Leave it with me. Go get some sleep. - With pleasure. Thanks. (gentle suspenseful music) (Jimmy sighs) (Jimmy sniffs) (Jimmy exhales sharply) (dramatic music) (gentle suspenseful music) - Oh-oh. - Oh, fuck. - I-I didn't, I didn't do this, okay? You have to believe me. - Oh, fuck. - I didn't, I didn't kill her. - What did you do? What did you do? - I didn't do it. Okay, I found her like this. I don't know what happened to her. Please, believe me, I didn't, I didn't do it. - (breathing heavily) Oh, fuck. Fuck, where's Jimmy? - I don't know. - Get - O-okay. - Jimmy, (stammers) get everyone to the kitchen, get... Fuck. (breathes heavily) Fuck. Fuck, fuck! So, uh, Cindy's dead. (suspenseful music) Who did it? Someone, someone cut out, (breathes heavily) they slit with thro- (dramatic suspenseful music) (Cindy groaning) (flesh squelching) (blood splattering) (sniffs) Someone in this house cut out her fucking tongue! - Don't be, don't. - You were, you were supposed to be on the watch last night. What happened? - I fell asleep. I came downstairs to piss and here we are. - Wait, be-before you checked the washroom? - Yeah. - We all heard you threatening her. - Wait, what was your little fight about? - I didn't kill her. - You know, everything changed the moment Hannah came into the house. - I was with Hannah. - You're lying. - Please, the two of you probably did it together. - What about Bill? He's just as new as Hannah. - If I wanted you dead, I'd just shoot ya. - Well, we should probably try and stay in groups if we can. - I think Bill should be the one to find out who did it. - I can help, Winter. - Fuck that. I bet you did it, you creepy little man. Frankie, you should be the one to help Bill. - That's fine, I just, I just thought, that's okay. (wind whistling) (Frankie breathes heavily) - Well, whoever did this has her tongue. - She didn't deserve this. None of us deserve this. (breathes heavily) Okay. (breathes heavily) Okay. (stammers) Those, those things (gentle suspenseful music) out there, you've, you've seen them, what are they? - Oh, they're not human. Not anymore. - So, so what, l-like zombies? - Killing machines. (dramatic suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (static hissing) (signal squeaking) (Lauren and Hannah chattering faintly) (Jimmy sighs) - (chuckles) Yeah. (static hissing) (Lauren and Hannah chattering faintly) (Jimmy sighs) - [Lauren] Is there anyone, or you've just been on your own? - Lauren. You shouldn't have opened that door. (footsteps plodding) - Did you do it? Are you sure? - Where were you when everything changed? - I-I can't say what time it was when we saw them running toward us, so fast. I knew straight away that something was wrong, so we started running. (gentle suspenseful music) - How many of you? - Mom and dad. It didn't take long before my mother started falling behind. When it became clear that she couldn't keep up, my father shouted, "We love you, you are our pride and our joy. Don't look back." It was the worst day of my life. (footsteps crunching) (monsters growling) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Hey, what are you doing? - I think they're blind. And, and that sound, it's, it's like sonar. - Yeah, or they're talking to each other. - Why the fuck do you give a shit about what's going on with those things when there is someone in this house killing us? (wind whistling) (crows cawing) - Whoever did this to us did us a favor. When that baby came out, she was dead. And anyone with her was dead, too. This is a blessing. - What kind of fucking drugs are you on? - [Hannah] Mood stabilizers mainly. - And how are you coping without them? - I'm holding it together. - [Frankie] How did you get to the doctor's house? - You went through them way too fast. - What can I say? I'm a bad girl. - I can't. It's too much. If I lose my license, free ride's over. (chair creaking) - Do you remember when you did that to me? I kinda liked it. But you know who I think wouldn't like it as much as we did, Mrs. Charles. - You're damaged goods, Hannah. (sirens wailing) (crowd yelling and screaming) (monsters howling) - What's wrong with that guy? - How are your other medications? - They're fine. (knocking on door) - Excuse me, Dr. Charles, I might need you to come out to the front. (monster growling) Excuse me, sir. (objects clattering) (secretary screaming) (monsters growling) - We've gotta go. - I'm not going anywhere with you. - Stop, stop! (monsters growling) Come. (suspenseful music) - So I left with him. Now he's dead. - Mm, Lauren was here all night? She slept here? - Is there any way she could have snuck out of the room at all? Why not? - 'Cause I didn't sleep. - You didn't sleep all night? - I did hear someone crying, but it stopped. - [Lauren] She deserved to die. - [Frankie] (sighs) I'm surprised you'd say that. - So am I, but that's just how I feel. She tried to kill you and Becka. - Why did you go up to Hannah's room? - She didn't exactly get the warmest welcome. I just thought I'd go up and see how she was doing. I ended up staying. - And did you notice anything weird about her? - She's not a killer. - [William] Did you fall asleep? - Yes. - Could she have left after you fell asleep? - I'm a light sleeper. - Yeah, but not light enough to hear a murder a few feet away from your bedroom. - Did you do it, Frankie, (Frankie sighs) kill her before she got to you? - [Frankie] No. - I say it was you or Derek, you for revenge, and Derek 'cause he's the only one creepy enough to cut out someone's tongue. (monsters growling) - [Frankie] Any luck? - No. But can I help you guys out at all? - What did you see last night? You must have seen something. - Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh. It's okay. Nothing, except for Hannah. (gentle suspenseful music) I mean, last night she was in the corner talking to herself. It's like she wasn't all there. You know, I would've known for sure, but Lauren said she was with her, so I don't know. Take us with you. We gotta get outta here, Winter, before we all end up like Cindy. - I'll take anybody that wants to go. I just can't bring a killer with us. - [Frankie] What happened after Jimmy took over your shift? - Yeah, Jimmy arrived. I told him to watch Hannah because of what I saw. And then I came downstairs and I went to bed. - You own a blade? - A knife? - Yeah. - No. - What do you shave with? - An electric razor until all this. - Do you think, (gulps) do you think Jimmy could have done something like this? - I don't know. Becka, maybe? - No, her marital troubles, right? - Jimmy talks tough, but I don't think he could do this. - Well, exactly. (suspenseful music) - No, I take it back. I think Jimmy is capable of doing something like this. - I know what this looks like. You think I don't know? Of course, everyone thinks I did it. I didn't. Goddammit. All that stuff before was just, it was just talk. You know? - What happened last night? - I fell asleep. That's it. (exhales sharply) I relieved Derek, I sat on the floor, I nodded off. - You carry a knife? - Yeah. - Let me see it. (Jimmy exhales sharply) - I don't know where it is, that's the truth. But anybody fucks with me, I still got this. - Okay, well, what happened this morning? - I woke up to take a piss, that's when I noticed that the knife was gone. - So someone took your knife and killed her? - Yeah. Becka. We all heard the fight. She wanted her dead. - I don't even want kids. (gentle suspenseful music) Rob was the one that wanted them. She wouldn't even let me brush her hair. - [Frankie] (breathes heavily) What were you and Cindy talking about? - It's got nothing to do with you, Frankie. - It sounded heated. - Because it was heated. - Did you kill her? - No, but I wish I had. - What were you talking about? - How about you mind your own fucking business? - It's kinda late for that now. - Her and Rob were having an affair. - Oh, shit, Becks. - Okay, I know it doesn't matter. It's fucking trivial now, but I don't know, after being cooped up in this house so long, I finally cracked and I told Sid the truth. - About what? - The baby in her stomach was Rob's. - Do you have a knife? - Yes. - [William] Let's see it. Give it to me. - No. - Give me the fucking knife. - No. - Don't worry about it. Just don't worry about it. - It used to be Rob's. He's not here anymore, is he? Tell him what happened, Frankie. - It's not important. - [William] Spill it, what happened? (Frankie breathes heavily) (suspenseful music) (crows cawing) (suspenseful music continues) (crows continue cawing) (monsters growling) (dramatic music) - [William] Who do you think killed her? - I don't know, but it should have been me. - Shh, be quiet. - Why? What? - Do not move. The temperature just dropped. (gentle suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (monster growling) (gentle suspenseful music continues) - Where's Hannah? (monster growling) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (monster growling) (gentle suspenseful music continues) - Hold that like your life depends on it. Go get the egg timer out of my bag upstairs, front pocket. (monster growling) (door thuds) When I distract him, take everybody and get 'em downstairs. (monster growling) (door thuds) (door thudding) (monster growling) (egg timer ticking) (door thudding) (monster growling) (egg timer ticking) (door thudding) (monster growling) (monster howling) (suspenseful music) (toy thudding) (monster growling) (suspenseful music continues) (egg timer ticking) (egg timer ringing) (monster howling) (footsteps plodding) - Hannah? Hannah? (gentle suspenseful music) Oh, thank God. (monster growling) - Whoa! - Son of a bitch! Give me that. (William grunts) (Derek panting) - [Derek] Oh my God, fuck. (panting) (monster growling) - It's still alive, Frankie. No, Frankie, don't- - Leave him. (monster growling and breathing heavily) (foot thuds) (flesh squelching) (monsters growling and howling) - I'm not like you. (panting) - Yeah, you are. First time I met one of those things, it was the exact same thing. - I don't believe that. (panting) - It was one-on-one in the forest outside Russell Bay, right before, um. - Who was it? - My wife. - [Derek] The creatures? - No, people. Bad fuckers. Seth? (suspenseful music) - Hi, Bill. Look, sorry to show up like this. - It's okay, baby. - Bill! - I'm gonna fucking kill her. - She's got a gun to her head. - (exhales sharply) You have something I want. - Take the gun away from her fucking head! - You have something I want. - What, what do I have? - Bill, I know you work for Acorp now. All right, there's no shame in it. I know you've fallen on hard times, we all have. Oh, we've been there. It's locked up tighter than Fort Knox, how do we get in? - With fucking keys. - Then give us the fucking keys! - That's enough! Oh, Bill, Bill. - Fuck this! (dramatic music) (Mrs. Winter shrieks) - Motherfucker! (grunts) - No, no! (gunshot fires) - Ah, ah. No! Ah, no! - Come on! Come on! - [William] No! (metal thuds) (William grunts) - This is the world now, Bill. It was always gonna be this way. - [Derek] Is that who you're chasing? - [William] That's who I'm gonna kill after they suffer first. - (panting) I can help you. - No, that's my job. - Are you gonna make it? - I'll survive. - Good. I could use you upstairs. - Sure. (Derek breathing heavily) They're not complicated. You gotta stay still. Keep your breathing down. Keep your heart rate low, you become invisible. Just have to not be afraid to die. (Derek breathing heavily) - Do you think you can go out and get him? Bring him back in the house? - You want me to go get the fucking dead guy? - Please? - Why? (gentle suspenseful music) - I think he was murdered. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music continues) Yeah, it's broken. - Well, he was hung. - Hanged, but you know what? No, that's not possible. He would've had to fall from at least five, five to nine feet. - Frankie, check his tongue. - (exhales sharply) Okay. Oh, jeez. (breathes heavily) (fist thuds) (exhales sharply) It was one of us. - It was one of you. - Are you gonna help me or not? (suspenseful music) (monsters growling) (monsters continue growling) Zeke was murdered by the same person. - That eliminates me. - And me. (Zeke groaning) (neck clicks) - Who wanted Zeke dead? - I heard the two of you arguing. - Yeah, well, I wouldn't kill him. - Why not? (gentle suspenseful music) - Because he's my son. (gentle suspenseful music continues) - Your son refers to you by name? - Where was he going? - To the closest houses to get food and medication for his migraines he said. - Lauren, weren't you and Zeke an item? - We, he hit on me a couple times, that was it. - Dammit, he's my son. - The only thing we know, Jimmy, is that you and Zeke arrived at the same time. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) - Okay. (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) - From my perspective, it's either Jimmy or it's Becka. - It's not Becka. It, it can't be. - They both- - It's not, it, it can't be. - They both had their threats. - It can't be, all right? She wouldn't do something, she, she couldn't do something like this. Could she? - How can you play cards? - Like this. - (scoffs) You're bad news. - I'm a regular grim reaper. - Yeah, you're high, too. - Just a little. (Hannah breathes heavily) (Hannah whispering) (gentle suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music continues) - Lauren, stop. (suspenseful music) There's something on her neck. Hannah, move forward. - Oh my God. - What, what the fuck is it? - Guys, stay here. - [Lauren] Hannah, stay still. - The two of you need to come downstairs now. (gentle suspenseful music) (flesh squelching) - I'm sorry. - Oh, what the fuck? (suspenseful music) - She's changing into one of those things. - I'm not, it's nothing. - It's gonna be okay, Hannah. - Are you sure? - Okay, she is something growing on her neck. - A wing, (stammers) what? - I don't know, it's like a lump. - Show us. - Fuck you. - Calm down. - I wanna see it! - Just... - You have to show it to them, sweetie. - Yeah. - Hey, look, hey. All right? We just wanna take a look. - Turn around, Hannah. (suspenseful music) Hannah, turn around. - It's fine. (suspenseful music continues) Um, I don't know, it doesn't really look like anything, I, oh. (Hannah retching) - Well, that's something. - Help me. P-please, please. - Here, just, just get her down from there. - Here, no, wait. (suspenseful music) (fist thuds) (William grunts) (liquid trickling) (retching) What am I? - Hannah, you're, um, you're dying. - Okay. - Does it hurt? - Yeah. Yeah. - When did you start noticing the pain? - A-after I got here. - Was that before or after dinner? - (breathes heavily) After. (suspenseful music) - She was in Sid's room. - Jesus, slow down. (gentle suspenseful music) Acorp shit. - Could that have done it? (William sighs) - Who's is this? - Oh, shit, that's Zeke's bag. - Zeke the dead guy? - Yes, the dead guy. He, he went next door with this, we saw him leave with this. I think we gotta go next door. Can you get us there? - Yeah. (Hannah groaning) - Hannah? (suspenseful music) - (breathing heavily) I'm still here. (Hannah exhales sharply) I never should have made it this far. - What do you mean? - I, I tried to kill myself three times. The last time I really tried to. (Hannah grunting) (flesh squelching) (crying) Not a cry for help. I was done. (retching) I was done with all the loneliness. (suspenseful music) You're a good friend. (Hannah screaming) (golf club thudding) (Lauren grunting) (monster growling) (Lauren grunting) (shoe squeaking) (Lauren breathing heavily) (Frankie breathing heavily) (monsters howling) - Okay, calm, we're not here to fight. (gentle suspenseful music) Let's go. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (monsters howling) - Where's Derek? (suspenseful music) - Hannah's dead. - I did not kill my own son. - You still sticking with that story? - It's no story, you bitch. That was my boy hanging in that tree. - Yeah, I call bullshit. - Hey, keep your voices down. - Where were you? - Upstairs. - Help me out here, Derek. - No, I can't. - Look, I never killed anybody and I'm not starting now. - [Becka] You threaten people and they die. - Look, Frankie and Bill will figure this out. I'm not a bad guy. You'll see, (stammers) we need to wait for Frankie and Bill. - No, no, no, no. You're the only one strong enough to hoist a body into a tree. - That is complete bullshit, Derek, you or Frankie could do the same. (flesh squelches) (Jimmy groans) (suspenseful music) (groans) We need to stick together. Please. (flesh squelches) (Jimmy groaning) No. (groaning) (flesh squelching) No, stop, we, we need to stick. (groans) Oh, no, no, please, stop, stop, stop. (flesh squelching) (Jimmy groaning) (Lauren and Becka grunting) (Becka breathing heavily) You dumb fucks. (blood splattering) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Guys, we found something. Jesus, Jimmy. - What the fuck happened? - We found the killer. - He's gone. (Frankie breathing heavily) (gentle suspenseful music) - You, you all did this, why? - Don't sound so surprised, Frankie. This is how this was supposed to go. - We found two dead bodies next door and both of them had their tongues cut out. - What house? - 47. - You killed Clara and Denise. - Yes. - Get, get off. - Hey, shut up. - Stop. (shrieks) - Yes, I did. And, God, it felt good to shut her up forever. One of the best days of my life was when I got to stab her until she was gone. - You murdering fuck. (gentle suspenseful music) - Darling, you've never looked so beautiful. (suspenseful music) (Denise crying) (Denise sobbing and screaming) (objects clattering) (monster growling) - (screaming) Please, please. (screaming) (monster growling) (Denise screaming) (flesh squelching) - Pull the trigger, Winter. (gun clicks) (suspenseful music) You couldn't feel the difference? I would have. (Becka breathing heavily) (bullets rattling) When you saved me. (Derek grunting) - Give me that. (metal thudding) (William grunting) (monster growling) - (panting) Oh, fuck. (bullets rattling) (suspenseful music) (Derek breathing heavily) I believe this is yours. - So, the, the, the, the, the tongues? (Becka breathes heavily) - They're mine. - You're a monster. - Yes, I belong, you are the ones who are all out of place here. Winter and I, this is our time. To those of us left. - I'm not like you. - (chuckles) You will be. - Cindy was pregnant. - She wouldn't keep her fucking mouth shut! Just listen. You hear that? That's heaven. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, it's okay. No more crying. - You're not getting outta here alive, I'm gonna string you up like the boy outside. - Oh, not a boy, heavier than a boy, it was convincing though, wasn't it? - Why? - Why, why Zeke? He found out about me, about my shift. (Zeke exhaling sharply) (Zeke coughing) Where were you, Zeke? - [Zeke] I left. - Where did you go? (Zeke exhales sharply) - I didn't have a choice. - Why don't you try and get some rest? We can talk about this more in the morning. - I saw something (gentle suspenseful music) when I was in the house, I came across two bodies. - That's the world we live in now, Zeke. - They were murdered, man. One of 'em was chewed up and eaten, but someone tied her to the bed. And the other woman, she had a fucking plate sticking out of her face. She was stabbed so many times, I couldn't even count it. The thing is, I didn't find a third body, so that means some crazy fucking psychopath got out. And now maybe he's frozen dead somewhere. Maybe he's not. Maybe he's one of those fucking things, maybe not. Maybe, - I want you to calm down. - [Zeke] maybe, maybe they're just like a regular person. You know, like you, or me. (suspenseful music) (Zeke groaning) - Now, I can't take full credit for Sid going over the edge. That was you. (Becka grunting) But I helped. - I wish I could walk out that door. - Why can't you? (gentle suspenseful music) - The whole world has turned to a pile of shit out there. - Has it? Tell me, Sid, how do you know it's the whole world? I always thought I didn't fit in anywhere. (Becka groaning) There was never a moment where I felt like I belonged until now. You should all be happy for me! I am exactly when I belong. And, Winter, I have you to thank, you taught me how to walk on water. (monsters growling) (footsteps plodding) What time is it? - Why? - What fucking time is it? - Uh, seven, s-seven. Around seven, I don't know. (alarm ringing) (Becka breathes heavily) - Trial by fire. Good luck. (static hissing) (upbeat music) (Becka sighs) (monsters howling) - No! (everyone breathes heavily) - Hey, stop, stop. - Becka, Becka, I can't leave her. - You have to, you have to stay still. - Let go of me! - You have to stay still. - I can't. (monsters howling) - They're everywhere! (monsters growling) (weapon thudding) (Frankie grunting) - [Frankie] Becka, Becka, where are you? - Just leave me, Frankie. - You're all I have left, Becka, please. (monsters growling) (Lauren screams) (monster howling) (Frankie groaning) Oh. Becka! - Do it! (monsters growling) (Becka screaming) (flesh squelching) - Becka! I'm sorry. (mumbles) (monsters growling) (monsters continue growling) (audience claps) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) - I know you wanna shoot me, Winter. Here's your bullet. (bullet clanks) (footsteps thudding) (sirens wailing) That'll keep 'em busy. - Stop. (sirens continue wailing) - Thank you. (gunshot fires) (Derek grunting) (Derek grunting) (flesh squelches) (William groans) (fist thuds) (William grunting) (William groaning) (fists thudding) (William groaning) (Derek groans) - Ah, fuck. (suspenseful music continues) (William breathes heavily) - I'm smart enough to know you don't like me very much, Winter, but you're the best friend I ever had. - I should have saw it coming. The weirdo with the fanny pack. (Derek chuckles) You're nothing. You're less than nothing. - I can see you're angry and you're hurt. But you're also on a mission. You have a plan, you have a vendetta to settle. I like that. So I'm gonna help you, Winter. I'm gonna go to Acorp and I'm gonna kill those bastards for you. - Don't, don't take that away, don't take that away from me. (Derek groaning) I'm gonna kill you. - No, friends help friends. I'm in the game now. - I'm gonna fucking kill you. - Come catch me. (suspenseful music) (William breathing heavily) (suspenseful music) (footsteps crunching) (suspenseful music continues) - I'm gonna wipe that smile off your face, you Goddamn motherfucker. Oh, Jesus Christ, I wanna fucking kill you. (gentle suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music continues) - Attaboy, Winter, keep up, buddy. (gentle suspenseful music continues) (William sighs) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues)
