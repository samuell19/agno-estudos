- Good afternoon, Huxley State. This is "Between the Beach", your favorite college campus radio show with the greatest host of all of college radio, man, I am your boy, CJ, helping you kick off the weekend. And as you know, I got my man Drew helping me tag team the local music scene. Talk to 'em, Drew. - Top of the afternoon, you beautiful listeners. Today we got the freshest music on the scene from the hottest local artists that nobody knows yet. Hey, I'm about to sweat. This stuff is piping hot. - That's what I'm saying, man. The music that we have lined up today is gonna revolutionize the way that you listen to music. I'm talking about, if you introduce Mozart to cave dwellers, we got it. It's hot. - Play that shit, baby. - All right, man, the track that we got lined up today is off of Van Ham's new album, "Let's Get It". - So you're done with waiting tables, right? - Yeah, that shit sucks. - Yeah, so what are you gonna do now? - I don't know, man. It's the same shit over and over again every single time. And I'm just, I'm sick of it. - Dude, talk to Jim. - At Bogeys? - Yeah. He'll let you bartend. - Need a bartender's license for that? - I don't fucking know. You do that, you're making over 13 an hour. You like the place you work. I don't know. 'Cause you're not listening to me. I've been telling you technical college. Those dudes make bank, and it's two years in and out. - But I wanna find something I actually like. You know, like I, I don't wanna blow all my money on some shitty business degree and then be miserable nine to five every day of my life at a computer typing away, getting fucking carpal tunnel. - Dude, you're already miserable nine to five. Just you might as well have money if you're gonna be miserable, you know. - But I'm not in debt though. That's the difference. That's big difference. - You got a point. You got a point. I mean like look at me, right? Is my passion fucking accounting? No. But it pays all right. They say it pays all right. - Do you know anything about what accountants do? - Fuck no. - I don't think they do anything. I think it's a made-up job. - I'd rather coach T-ball than be a fucking accountant. - I don't get it, everyone, everyone's just signing their life away at 22 and they don't even think about it, and it just, it doesn't, it doesn't make any sense. - That's fucking facts. - All right, man, thanks for the ride. - Sure, tell Chloe I say what's up. - Yeah, you wanna go to the bar tonight? - Absolutely, it's been way too fucking long. - I know. I'll, uh, I'll try to get the girls to go, you know, head out. - Cool. - All right. Peace dude. - Hey, baby. - Hi, how are you? - Good. - Burger in my mouth. You want a salad? - Oh, sure, thanks. - Okay. - Did you smoke? - Uh, no Wyatt was smoking in his car. - I can smell it on your face. - That's 'cause Wyatt was smoking in his car. - Mm-hmm. Like this one? - Yeah, it's kinda small. - It's New York, everything is small. - Where is it? - Uh, East Village. It's like 15 minutes out on the subway. Kind of wanted something I could walk to, but everything over there is so expensive. - Couldn't you live with like another med school student? - Yeah, I could. Actually made a post about it the other day. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Did you get any bites? - Uh, some girl, Amy. - Amy. - Mm-hmm. - She seem nice? - She's a dancer. - Dancing? - Yeah. - You like dancing. - I do know how to dance. - I've, you've danced- - I know. - Before at one point. - All right, I should probably study if we're gonna go out tonight. - Okay. - So sick and tired of these classes. I can't wait until next year, I can just do my own thing. - Mm. By the way, I've been thinking about this. I know it's a few months away, but I think that, um, when you go out there, I'll get a ticket, come out with you, help you move in, help you get settled. Maybe stay there like a week or two. - Yes, but, uh, my parents are actually gonna help me move in. My sister's driving up from Boston. - Damn. - So I'll probably spend most of my time with them. - That's okay. - Okay. - Well then maybe like, uh, September, once you're all settled. - Um, yeah, we can talk about it. It's just kinda hard 'cause I don't really know what my schedule's gonna be like. - Yeah, that's fair. Well, then we can, uh, you know, we'll do like a switch every couple months or something like that. - Maybe. - And because we love you guys so much, we have another gift for y'all, a VIP visitor flying in all the way from L.A, Van Ham, man. One of my closest high school friends. The hottest artists coming outta L.A, and he will be on the show tomorrow. - That's right, he's gonna be here. He is gonna be live. He's gonna be doing a song off of his new album, so be sure to be there. It's gonna be poppin'. Van Ham has the vibes to get us through finals week. - And great vibes for the final week of living large. And if you're about to graduate like me and Drew that especially applies to you. - If you're seeing straight, you're not doing it right. - So what's it gonna be? This has been "Between the Beats" and take a shot for me and your boy, aight? - Keep it sexy, y'all. Peace. - You know, I can't believe we got like two more those. - I know. Can't do any more class, I'm done. But also it's gonna be fucked up not to have that buffer zone. You know what I mean? I really don't know what I wanna do. - Yeah, for sure. I feel you. - We should, uh, go in on a weed farm. - Make a weed farm. I'm pretty sure we could have that on lock like a marijuana prairie or something. - I mean, I couldn't do an office job, and my dad could maybe finance it. - Tight, tight, smoke for free. Heard you. - Smoking for free is nice. - Didn't you say you had a, a plug or something like that? - No, I mean, he's got the gas, but he doesn't hook me up. It's a business situation. - What you mean? - I didn't tell you about this? - Uh-uh. - I'm writing his essays for him and if I get him a C or better, I smoke for free. - I can't write no papers. That's, nah. - Oh, no. I kinda write my opinions and then just put a random source down. - So this is, we went to this organic vineyard. - Sam, it's gorgeous. - Near Pisa. I know it looks like a painting. The wine was like- - I love it. - The best wine I've ever had obviously. - Sam. - Oh. - Chlo. - Sam. - Hi. - Hi. - My god, how are you? - Hi, congrats on- - Miss you. - Med school. - Thank you. I wanna hear everything about abroad. - Oh, I mean, I'm not gonna stop talking about so. Um, can you guys help me with my suitcases, please? I'm really tired from the plane. - You are so needy. - I'm just- - Oh, yes, it was. - It was a very long flight. - See, all right. - What is in this thing? - So that one has fragile stuff in it, so please be very careful. So I brought you guys a little something from my travels. - Oh. - Vino. - My house mom gave it to me before I left. Like she is complete angel. I literally like her more than my grandma. Whoops. - Sounds serious. - So Leila, what are we doing for your birthday party? - Oh, worst ending. This semester has been atrocious. - Yeah. - Oh. Yeah, you need to let your tits out now you have like a six figure job. - Speaking of going out, the boys wanna go to the bar tonight? - Wait the same bar? - Oh my god. - Yeah. - What is this a fucking sitcom? - Yes, but they're so excited to see you. - They're not excited to see me. - Drew is excited to see you. - Drew's obsessed with me. - Yeah, everyone knows that. - But I'm actually off the market now. - Wait, what? Federico, that like sexy Italian tutor? - Long distance. - Wow. - Isn't that crazy? - Wild. - I know. I know, I just like, I was just like, why not? You know? - Yeah. - Yeah. - And he actually asked me to move in with him. - You're serious? This isn't like a bit? - No, like he literally did. And like I might move to Florence in the fall. - Whoa. - That's- - I don't know. - Wow. - Maybe I'll like it though. How about you and Jaimie, Chloe? Have you talked about New York yet or? - No. Not yet. - Hmm. - What? Okay, let's not make this about me. Cheers. - Yo, Drew, how's it look? - Well, it's not the worst thing I've ever seen you wear. - I'll take it. How's the show? - It was good. You know, it's always good with CJ. - What's good? - Yo, Wyatt. Yo, can you grab me a beer? - Yeah, I got you. - Thank you. Yeah, dude, CJ's really good. - His energy is just like unmatched. You know what I mean? It's like if I- - What's up? - Thanks, man. How was practice? - In the middle of a sentence? - Bullshit as usual. - Rolling a J. - You got a job yet? - No, he has not. - I got things lined up. - Okay. - Like what? - Like things that are way more fun than reading about Freud in psych class. - Freud, oh yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Not really my speed. I'm more of a Jung guy. - Yeah, me too. - You guys still wanna come up to the cabin tomorrow night? - Yeah, I gotta run it by Chloe. - Didn't you say it was just gonna be us three? Isn't that what you said? - No, I know, I know. I'm just saying. - You said it was only gonna be me- - I know. - You and him. - I know, I'm just saying like, I'll run it by her. - My dad just did some renovations on the place. - Shit. Found about you smoking all that weird, and he took your trust fund money. - It's not trust fund, dude. I think I've explained this, it's a college fund. - Oh, my gosh. - A college fund. - That has to be top three most pretentious things you've ever said. - It's a college- - And that's saying a lot. - I'm bad, I'm bad. - College plus immediate after college and a little after that. - That's true. - Girls coming to the bar tonight? - Uh, yeah, they are. - Is Sam back from Argentina? - She is. Italy. Um, and she actually, apparently she met some guy there. - Really? - Yeah. - Huh? - Can't beat out those Italians, huh, Drew? - Dude, uh, why do you always insist on bringing this up, okay? - You know what they say about the Italians? - We're friends. - Yeah. - Our parents go- - You don't, you don't have to explain yourself. - You wanna let me finish? - Yeah. - We're friends. Our parents go to synagogue together. It would be weird. - Mm-hmm. - That's why I don't want to, as I've tried to explain. - Don't forget about summer camp though. Tell us about summer camp. - We were 14-years-old, you freak. Why you always thinking about 14-year-olds kissing? It's weird. It's been a minute since we hit the bar, guys. - Yeah, last time we went out, last time we went, Carly was with us. - Oh, shit true. Dude, what is good with Carly? You know what I'm saying? - I haven't talked to her in like two weeks and honestly it's been super nice. I've been feeling Zen as fuck. You guys notice that? - No. - No. - But genuinely what's happening? Like, you know, is there an end date on this? Like I, I feel like last time you guys split up, you were back together like two days later. What's the deal? - Me and Carly are on a short break. I need some time, figure shit out, play some ball, you know? I don't know, we'll see what happens. - Does play some ball and figure out shit out translate to just getting with other girls? - Drew, you shouldn't seen me in a high school after every game different girl. That's how I'm trying to be again. - Every game? - Every game. - That's just, that's just not what happened at all. I'm gonna be, I want that on the record, that's just not at all what happened. - I'm getting a little sick of the same poon to be honest with you. - Did you just say poon? - You just said poon, it's not the 80's. - Jaimie, you know what I'm saying? - What? - You've been with the same girl since what? Sophomore year of high school? I know what you're thinking about other girls. - No, actually I'm not at all. The one person I remember from high school was Jess Spiegelman. - Jess Spiegelman. - Jess Spiegelman. - What I remember about Jess Spiegelman is that Jaimie was trying to go to homecoming with Jess Spiegelman, and then I swooped in and took her. - You know what she told me? She only went to homecoming with you because you had your driver's license. Swear. - No. - She told me that. - Jess Spiegelman, she was trying to get with me since like seventh grade. In family consumer science we were cooking eggs. - You know, she's a stripper now. - Yo guys- - Jess Spiegelman? - Exotic, exotic dancer. - Yo guys. - Sorry. - Guys, guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I love talking about high school, guys. I love- - Drew, shut up. - You guys wanna hear about my high school? - No. - Who invited this guy? - I didn't invite him. - Who invited Drew? - I don't know, bro. He said he was diddy bobbing for animal crackers. I said, what? I was crying, y'all. I don't even know, man. Don't know. - CJ. - Yo, what's up, my boy? - What's up, how are you? - What's going on? - Good to see you. - What's up, Jaimie? - Jim. - Jaimie and the boys. - How are you? - Ain't seen you guys in a while. - Hey, how you doing? - Good. How you doing? - Let's get a tab going, yeah? - What ya drinking? - Yeah. - Yeah, sure. - Four lights. - Four lights. Can get you that. - Sweet. - Anything on this card? - Put it on there. - Anything on here? - Uh, more, more money than anything could buy. - Dad's, that's why. - That's right, I know where to find his dad if he don't pay. - How you been? - I've been good. I've been good. We've been a little slow around here lately. - Yeah, what's going on? Why is it such a slow night? - They opened up new pub down the street. I don't know if you heard about or not, that JC's, I think they're stealing some of my customers. - Damn. - They got a dance floor, and a DJ, and the whole nine yards. - Damn, they're all going over? - I might have to send you down there to scout things out. - I'll do it, I'll pouch 'em. - Yeah, man, bring 'em back here. - I will. Um, are y'all hiring? - I don't know, I'd have to talk to Mike. See what he says. For you, looking for job? - Yeah, well, you know, extra cash. - Right, right. It'd be good to see you around here every day. - I'd love to. - All right, buddy, I'll talk to Mike. Put in a good word for you. - All right. Appreciate it. - All right, kiddo. Good seeing you. - All right. - I'm fucking doing here on the scene. - Yeah, close really matters. Oh. - Wanna get some shots? - Dude, Sam is looking- - All right, let's go. - Kinda nice right now. - You can do my special bullseye. Woo. - Thanks. - Oh, thanks, Jim. - You're welcome. - Hold on, wait. I, um, wanna do a toast. - Stop. - No, I want to, because I'm just so proud of you. - Oh my god, are you crying? - No. No, I'm not. - So I think- - I'm not- - I think you're crying. - Crying, I'm just, I'm just proud of you, and you worked really hard for this. So cheers. - Welcome home. - Cheers. Thanks. - All right, rumor has it there's a foreign man. - Oh, yeah. - Can't be real now. - No, Drew, you're actually not allowed to flirt with me anymore. - Ooh. - Sorry. - Well, I wasn't like actually flirting. - Oh no, I mean like I know I'm like the only nice Jewish girl around so like- - All right, Sam. Well as the resident nice Jewish boy it's actually my duty to flirt with you. - No, I know you like wanna get married. You wanna have a nice old Jewish babies. - Uh, I'm not literally like. - No, he does, he does. You wanna like name them like Seth and Rebecca. - So you think about this? - I'll get drunk at their bar mitzvah 'cause they're twins. - No, I don't want that. - You know, it would be a sweet life, but unfortunately I, I met an Italian man and, uh, he's Jewish. - He's Jewish? - No, wait. Tell him how you met. - I'm taken. - No, it's such a long- - Please. - Story. - I wanna hear it again. - All right, let's hear the story. - So we have these Italian tutors, right? Our first meeting we're supposed to meet at this cafe, and like I see this gorgeous guy coming over. It's Federico. - Federico? - Yeah. Okay, so the first I couldn't tell if he was flirting with me, 'cause like everyone's really flirting over there. - Well, okay, you were obviously flirting. - Yeah, no, I mean, no shit, I was flirting, but I couldn't tell. And then, but by then end the lesson, like I had agreed to go to dinner with him. - Wow. - You say he is Jewish too? - Yeah, I know. And he's like visiting me in, in a couple months. - Okay. - You sure he is coming? - Yeah. - Has he booked his flight? - Fuck you, Wyatt. - Has Frederick- - Oh, my god. - Booked his flight? - No, no, actually he hasn't booked his. - It's probably not real. - What's the matter with you? - All I'm saying is what if he meets a pretty Italian woman over there? - Okay, why are you such a dick? - Hey, it's, I'm just making me point. I'm just. - Oh, I knew you wouldn't understand. That's okay. You, you asked if you hear this story. - Sam. - No, I'm gonna go now. - No, it's okay. They're just fucking with you. - Oh. - Guys, what the fuck? She's excited. - Look, Federico will come, Federico will go. - Okay. - I can't believe I'm gonna be gone in like three months. - I know we've been talking about it for so long now it's actually happening. - What are you gonna do when I'm gone? - I don't know. I asked Jim if they're hiring, so maybe I'll do that. Something new. - Have you thought about going back to school? - Um, a little. - And? - Would it make you happy? - Would it make me happy? - Yeah. - It's not about me. I feel like it'd be good for you. - Yeah. Okay. - I'm worried about you. - Chloe, do not say stuff like that. - Okay. - I hate it when you say. - Okay, okay, great. More, long distance has always just been this idea for us, now that it's actually happening, I feel like you think it's gonna be easier than it actually will be. - No, I know, I know it's gonna be tough. Obviously, it's gonna be hard. - Calling each other every day that's gonna suck. - We don't have to call- - It's gonna be horrible. - Each other every day. - And then what if we start to hate each other? - Are you, are you saying you don't wanna do long distance? I don't get what you're saying. - No, that's not what I meant. I mean, it's gonna be different for us. - Yeah, I, I get that. - Do you? - Yeah. - It's gonna suck being far away from each other. And, so what if we aren't far away from each other, and I went to New York. - What? - Yeah, it would be fun. Think about it, we could be in, we could be a little New Yorkers together and explore the city, and. - Jaimie, what would you do? Could you accept afford it? - Don't, I could get a job or I could get like a loan go to school. - That's gonna be expensive. - We'll figure it out. - Can we talk about this in the morning? - Well, you kind of brought it up just now, so I'd like to talk- - Okay, I know. - About it now. - I'm sorry. I said anything. Can we not talk about this tonight? - Yeah, fine. Yeah, we can talk about it later. Great, tonight is your night, so let's, let's celebrate like we came here to do. - Hey, Bella, right? - Uh, hey, Drew. Child psych. - Do you mind if we join you? - Yeah, of course. Um, this is my roommate, Ivy. - Hey. - Hi. Uh, this is Wyatt. - Wyatt, nice to meet- - Hey. - You, ladies. - Yeah, uh. - Uh, what, what year are you guys? - Freshman. - Freshman. - You? - We're seniors, so we're almost done. Cheers to that, right? - Very cool. - So are you a psych major too or? - No, uh, architecture actually. - Oh, wow, cool, cool. So have you done this essay yet for class? - Yeah, yeah, I finished it like last week. - Oh my god, why? - It's due Monday. - Oh, okay. Uh, well maybe I could run some topics by you. You wanna get a drink? - Yeah, sure. - What did you say your name once again, Eileen? - Ivy. - Ivy, that, that's a good name. That's, I like that name. - Thanks. - That's cool. Ivy. I'm gonna go piss. I'll, uh, see you around. - Uh, I'm doing mine on forms of discipline in early childhood. - Oh. Okay, um, maybe I could do mine on the like, like what do you do if your kids a psychopath. - That has nothing to do with child development. - Okay, psychopaths have to develop too. What about, um, what do you do if your kid walks in on you having sex? - That sounds super specific. - Yeah, I was 13. I had to go to bar mitzvah lessons. It was a Sunday and I just walked in, and my dad was just like railing my mom doggy, like over a dresser. Like, you know, I couldn't look at them for weeks. - Is that true? - Yeah. No, no, I'm fucking with you. - Oh, okay. - I would not be here. I'd be scarred. - Well, okay, you know what? Write about that. - You think I should write my essay about my fake story about my parents fucking doggy style? - Yeah, I think it sounds super personal and the TA would love to read it. - That's probably a C minus- - Yeah. - Kinda situation. Which good for me. - Which rocks. - Right? - Yeah. - What's going on here? I'm heading up. - Okay. Okay, um, well, maybe we could all go together and- - I'm going to Carly's though so. - Carly's? - Yeah. - I thought you were done with that. - I am done with her. I'm just going there to hook up with her. 0% chance getting back with her. - Yeah, that's what you said last time, dude. - Yeah, but horny as shit. Nothing's working out over there. - Dude. - That's the only option I got, so can I get the keys? - All right, fine here, but just text me or something, okay? All right. So, um, do you do like any extracurriculars or anything? - Yes. - No way. - And she thought, oh, shit. - What? - Should I get it? - Yeah, yeah, put it on speaker. - Hello? - Hey, baby, what's going on? I'm, I'm outside, do you wanna let me in? - What do you mean you're outside? - I'm outside your place. I, I was walking back from the bar. Just really wanted to see you. - Um, Wyatt, uh. - Come on just for a second. I just wanna talk to you. - Um, yeah, okay, one sec. - I've been thinking the past couple weeks, and I wanted to come here, and be honest with you. - Wyatt. - I wanna be with you. This break is done. I don't wanna see other people. And I know I said that and I've said that before, but. - Can we talk about this when you're not drunk? - We haven't talked in two weeks, and I miss you. I don't wanna talk now. Just go to the bedroom. - Why? - Don't you miss me? - Come on. - It'll be different this time. - Can I be honest with you? - Yeah. - Um, okay, I, I didn't wanna say it like this, but I guess this is happening, so I'm just gonna say it. I started seeing someone else. - What? - Yeah, um, I met him at, I, I met him at the sorority formal and I don't know, I, I don't think it'll be anything serious, but I wanna keep seeing him. - Why, who is this guy? - I just said I met him at the sorority formal. - Is he fucking here right now? - No, he's not here right now, okay? Can you just keep your voice down? - Carly, what the fuck? - Wyatt, I didn't ask for any of this, okay? I didn't ask for you to come here tonight. I didn't ask to go on a break, you wanted it. You said, "That you wanted to see other people." - I didn't mean that though. - What did you want me to do just sit here and wait for you? - Not go fuck other people. Fuck! - Wyatt. You don't even like me. - Yes, I do. - No. You're just sad and horny. - What are you gonna start dating this guy now? - I don't know. But at least he's nice to me. It's time to see other people. - You're making a mistake. - Wyatt, come on. - Just so you know. Because look at me, all right? And you know what, you disgust me. - I disgust you? - Yeah. You disgust me, Carly. I could have gone home with someone tonight instead I'm fucking here. - Okay, well, why don't you go back to the fucking bar then, Wyatt. - You're never gonna meet anybody like this again. I walk out that door and I'm fucking gone. Best thing you're ever gonna meet. - Oh yeah? - Gone. - Get the fuck out. - Fuck! Fucking dammit. - Hi, there, Officer Forster, West St. Paul Police Department. Reason for the stop today is you took the turn onto Humbolt wide. You got your license proof insurance on you? - Uh, yeah, let me, let me grab it. - And your proof of insurance. - Oh. I don't, I'm not, I'm not seeing it. - All right, man. You find that for me, and I'll be right back with you, okay? All right, buddy, I'm gonna have you step out, and I'm gonna make sure you're okay to be driving, all right? - I'm, I'm fine, I'm, I'm tired. - Oh, I understand that. I'm just, gotta make sure you're okay to be driving, all right? Go and step out. Don't move your head. - I'm not. One, two. Fuck. - Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going. Okay. All right, so the legal limit is .08, and you just blew a .09. So right now you are under arrest. Turn around, put your hands behind your back. - It's barely even over. - Turn around and put your hands beyond your back. I'll be right with you, okay? - I had a good time last night. - Oh, me too. That was really fun. Can I, um see you again? - Yeah, I'm free tonight, tomorrow. The next day, I'm free. Um, the next day, I'm free. - Um, I'm actually gonna go up to my dad's cabin tonight if you wanna come. - Yeah. Uh, could I bring my roommate? - Roommate? - Ivy. You met her. - Yeah, from the bar. Yeah, for sure. No one else, I had a party last time my dad almost killed me, but never mind. - Hey. - Hey. - I made you some breakfast. - Thanks. - Can I have a bite? - Sure. - You're so pretty. - Thank you. Um, I should probably get going soon. I gotta help Sam decorate for Leila's birthday today. - Mm, okay. Are you all going out today? - Yeah, going clubbing tonight. - Okay. Um, the guys were gonna go up to Drew's cabin tonight, but we could stay back if you, if you want us to celebrate with y'all. - No, that's okay. I'm pretty sure Leila wants it to be just the girls tonight anyway so. - Okay. By the way, um, I don't know why I didn't think of this before, but I was thinking in the kitchen. And when you go to New York, we could get a studio apartment and then split the rent. And then we'd basically be paying the same as what we're paying here. - Jaimie, I really don't wanna get into this right now. - Okay. - Where are you going? Jaimie. What, what's the problem? I didn't think you were actually being serious about yesterday. - Why would I, why would I not be serious about that? That's not something you would just say out of the blue. What's going on? What's, what's happening up here? I, I don't know. Do you think I'm holding you back or something or- - Why? - What's going on? - I have never said that before. Moving to New York is a, a big decision. I don't know if you're ready for that. And I don't wanna be the only reason why you would go. - You don't know if I'm ready for that. You, what does that, what does that, what does that mean? What does that mean? - I don't know, I don't know. I'm sorry. - Okay, well, can we still do long distance? - I don't know if, no, I don't know. - You don't know? - I don't know. - Or no, because I, I kind of need to know the difference on there. - I don't, I don't know what you want me to say. I don't know where this is coming from and. - Yes, I wanna do long distance would be a great thing to say. I would love it, I would love it if you said that right now. - That's not, I don't know yet.

I just, I, I need more, I need more time to think about it and I don't. - Yeah, no, take, take some more time. - Jaimie, I'm, I'm just like really overwhelmed, and I don't know what you want me to say.

Yo, I was thinking maybe, uh, you, me, and Wyatt could do like a, a trip to San Francisco this summer. - Yeah, sure. Why San Francisco? - You know, post grad trip would be nice. And Bella's an architecture major and she was talking about how like San Francisco has super sexy architecture or whatever. She's cool, man. You'd like her, you know. She, she does improv. She's funny. - Yeah, no, I've heard, I've heard the sexy architecture thing. Did you guys, did you make, make whoopee? - Yeah. - Sex? - Yeah, it's been like eight months. - Oh, that's specific. Pretty long, I'm sorry. Yo, Wyatt. - Yo. - Hey, what's up? How's practice? - Fucking shitty. - How's Carly's though? Can I come in? - Yeah. - Did you sleep there last night? - Nah-ah. - Then what'd you do? Thought you said you didn't wanna see her anymore. - I'm not, I'm not. I, I just wanna see what she was doing. I'm not trying to date her again. I wanted to hook up with her. I'm not trying to date her. She's seen another dude. - Who? - Wouldn't say. Can you believe that? What the fuck is it? It's been two weeks like. - Yeah. It's whatever though, right? - Yeah, yeah, it's whatever. She can do whatever she wants. But I couldn't stay there, so I'm driving back, fucking cop pops outta nowhere. - Are you serious, Wyatt? - Got a DUI. - What's up? What's going on? - Wyatt got a DUI. - Oh, shit, dude. Damn. - Did you give him the keys? - I, he was fine, man. I don't carry like a breathalyzer. - It was fucking .09. Like five more minutes, I would've been fine. - That's not how it works. - So what's going on with the playoffs? Can you play? - Coach Chaz isn't gonna hear shit. Only people who know about it are us three and Mr. Copper so. - All right. - Please for the love of God, do not tell Chloe. - I won't tell Chloe. - She tells Sam, whole fucking school finds out. - I won't tell her. - So, uh, you guys still good to go to the cabin? Do, because of this you wanna stay back or? - Yeah, I wanna get outta here. I'm trying to drink. - All right, well, I'm sorry, but also I'm not sorry because that was really fucking dumb. - What the fuck is his deal? Yeah, but you remember those girls from last night? - Yeah. - Bella stayed over. - At least you had a good night. - Yeah. I was thinking maybe I could invite her and that friend of hers to the cabin. - Eileen. - It's Ivy. - Yeah, I don't care. - All right, cool. And obviously don't tell Jaimie 'cause you know how he is with Chloe and stuff. - I won't. - Okay, cool. And I'm sorry about DUI, man, that's fucked up. That's, .09. - Right? - They need to fucking mind their own business. - I'm literally going on a drive, clear my head, and shit. - That's what I'm saying. - What? - It's like they're driving too. - Yeah. - Hang in there. - Been looking for financial analyst jobs all day. - Mm-hmm. - They look so boring. Like I should have thought about what do I wanna do with a finance degree before I spent four fucking years studying it? I don't like it. - Do you know what you're gonna do when you get to Italy? - Oh yeah, I'm just gonna teach Italian kids English. - Oh. - So cute, so fun. They love English. They all wanna learn English. The brownies. I can't. - So, um, Jaimie told me he wanted to move to New York with me yesterday. - Oh my god. Whoa. Okay, what did you, what did you say? - Um, I don't know. He was pushing it really hard, and we kind of got into a fight because I wasn't sure if that's what I wanted- - Right. - Or not. - Of course. What are you thinking now like? - I think that it would be a huge mistake. - Okay, yeah. - Yeah. - That's what we were kinda thinking. - Oh good to hear. - But it's just, no, it's just like, you need some alone time. This next chapter should be like very much about you. - Yeah. - And I don't know. I just feel like even if you guys are gonna end up together, you need to make sure of that right now, like by spending some time apart, right? - Yeah, I, I don't know. Are you like nervous at all to move to Italy? - No. - Like not even a little bit? - No. But it, it's very different for us. It's like we, I don't know, we just met. Like we've been dating for two months. It's really like exciting and stuff. And I've been with a lot of other people, so I know like okay, they weren't it. Like he's just so much better than them. He's who I wanna be with right now. - Got it. - Like you don't, you don't necessarily know that. Like you haven't really been with a bunch of other people and. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I mean, it would be nice to be with other people. - Yeah. - I kind of wanna figure out what it's like to live on my own for once. - Like when you picture yourself walking down the streets of New York, are you picturing like Chloe and Jaimie walking down the streets? Are you like Chloe walking down the streets alone? - I mean, I would want it to be alone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - It's like telling. - Pretty. - Like listen to that. - I guess. - Hello? - Hi. - Hello. I love what you guys have done with the place. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Who's it for? - I don't know. - It's for our other friend. - Oh, there's another there's another Leila? - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Happy birthday. - You guys are too sweet.

No outside. Cannot do that in here seriously. My dad will kill me. Can't do it. - I'm telling you. - Yeah, dude one time I smoked in here, god it was ugly. Just don't do it. - Okay. - All right. - Girls coming? - Yeah, they are. - What? - It's just Bella, Bella and Ivy. Bella and Ivy, Bella and Ivy. - Eileen. - Yeah. - Yeah, no. - Bro, Ivy. - Th girls from the bar. - Her name is Ivy. - No. - I told Chloe it was gonna be just guys. - Yeah, you told Chloe there just 'cause that's what you believed that it was just gonna be the guys. - Right. - And it's just gonna be the guy as far as Chloe's fucking concerned. That's not a lie. - Yeah. - You thought it was the truth. So it's the truth. - I gotta get that. - Dude. - That better be a pizza. Did we even order the pizza? - You gotta just relax. You take everything way too seriously. - It feels weird, dude. - Everything stresses you out. Let's go. - Yeah, dude. - Hey. - Good to see you. - Sure is. - Ivy. - What's up?

And then, uh, some big wig hits me up, and I get signed, and now I'm making music, and making some cash, doing it, you know? - Now you big time! - Going big time! - Yeah. - You need to make pictures of you for when you're famous.

I don't do well on that. - Birthday girl? - Uh, I'll just watch, but maybe, maybe later. - All right, suit yourself. Oh, oh, god. - Wow, man. - Yeah, I can't get over it. I know, I mean god. So CJ says that you're going to med school. - Mm-hmm, that's me. - What kind of doctor you wanna be? - I'm thinking pediatrician. - You ever thought about being a surgeon? - God no. My, my dad does surgery and that's just like very intense. - Yeah, a lot of fucking school. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. You wanna do one? - Okay. - Yeah? - Sure, yeah. - Okay. - So it's, um, really cool about how you kind of got up and just moved. I feel like you'd be really scared. - Yeah, you know I almost gave up after a year, and moved back home. And working all of these shitty fucking jobs, and I didn't wanna work. You know, I thought maybe I should have just gone to school and got a degree. - How important is school if you're going into the arts though? - But see that's the fucking thing, right? - Yeah. - You learn from the greats. Find an influence. And then if you have the passion and the drive, you just fucking do it. - There you go. - I mean, just like you, right? - Yeah, I don't need school. I just need passion, right? - Yeah. - I don't need school, do I? - Oh my god, I didn't mean that. - Mm-hmm. - I mean you need all the fucking training. You need all the school. - Yeah, definitely. - There you go. - Okay, don't look at me doing that. - How can I not? - Yeah, it's crazy. - Ooh. There we go, you good? - Yeah. No, I'm fine, I'm fine. - Um, I'm gonna go call Federico. - Okay, bye, Sam. - Who the fuck is Federico? - It's her, um, Italian boyfriend. - Ooh. - Like two months. - Ah, ah. - Yeah, she's planning on moving out to Italy for him. - Oh, yikes. That never really works out. - I mean, yeah, but she's happy so. - You're very pretty. - Thank you. - You wanna go and dance? Come on, let's go dance. I'm tired of fucking sitting around. - Okay. - Come on, come on. Let's go. - We're gonna go dance. - I'm at the club. FaceTime later? - You was the baddest girl in school. - Oh, shut up. I know you did not even look my way twice. - I did. What are you talking about? But you was dating that wrestler though. - Who? Who Phillip? - Yes. - Hey, I might head out soon. - Wait, right now? - Yeah, I'm sick. I just got so tired. - Okay. - Where's Chloe? - I think she's dancing. - Can we find her? - Yeah, yeah, let's go. Okay, wait, please don't go. I'll be right back. - For sure. - Chloe. Chloe. Hey. - Hey. - Uh, uh, we're gonna leave now. - Okay, yeah. - You leaving? - Yeah, she has to. - Okay. - So you don't want me to come with you guys? - Yeah, no, just stay here. Stay with CJ? - Are you sure? - Yeah, it's your birthday. Come on, just text us what you end up doing. - Okay. - Okay. I'm gonna take her home. Love you. - Come on, Chlo. - Where they going? - I saw Van and Chloe making out. They just made out on the dance floor. - What? - So you and Van was kinda crazy. - It was nothing. It was stupid. - What happened did you, did you just get like really fucked up? Like 'cause I saw you did coke. Or was he like coming onto you a lot? Was he being like really pushy? 'Cause like that makes sense sometimes like. Just like wondering. Do you think you're gonna tell Jaimie? - Sam, stop. - Okay. - Where the fuck did you go? I'm in there talking to Ivy by myself. - Sorry. Yeah, did you clean up the vomit? - No, was I supposed to? - Yes. - Ivy's in there calling her boyfriend or some shit. I'm not gonna pick up his puke by myself. - I'll do it in the morning. I, uh, I told Chloe I'd move to New York with her and bogies. - You did? - Yeah. She was talking about long distance and she sounded scared of it, and I don't blame her. So I was like, let's just cut out the middle man there. Just go to New York. - What the fuck are you gonna do out there? - Fuck if I know. I don't even know I'm gonna afford it, but maybe I shouldn't have said anything. - Think about it like this, right, you go out there, you wake up one morning, Chloe's gone, right? She's out of the picture. And you're gonna wake up in your little rat infested apartment. You're gonna be surrounded by Knicks's fans. That's bleak as fuck. - Yeah, I thought about stuff like that too. I don't wanna be in a tiny ass apartment in debt. I've always been scared some shit like this would happen. That she'd outgrow me and not need me anymore. You know, I used to go over to her place a lot, dinner with her parents and stuff. And it always felt weird, you know? It was, it was like, they're evaluating me the whole time, making sure I say the right thing, doing the right things. And, and with people like that, they, they can't, they can't, if you're not, if you don't know what you're doing or how you're doing it or, or how you're gonna pay for it or whatever, they don't, they don't get it, you know? But it didn't matter with Chloe. It, it never mattered. She was always like, do, do whatever the fuck you wanna do as long as you're happy. And now, now it's like, I gotta feel like I gotta talk to her the same way I talk to her dad. - She shouldn't be making you feel fucking inadequate like that, all right? - If I'm gonna be holding her back or something I, I, I don't know. - If she doesn't want you to come out there, that's her fucking problem. - Should probably check on Drew. - Bella's got him. - Hey. - Hey. - Bella. Hi. Hi. - Hi. - Good morning. - Yeah, that's awesome. - Bye, bye. - Jaimie. - Yeah? - Hey. - Hey. - Good morning. How was CJ's? - So fun. - That's good. - Is she awake? - Uh, no, she's still sleeping. - Have you talked to her yet? - I tried to talk to her in the car last night, and she like really didn't wanna talk about it. And I was trying to be supportive, and she like snapped at me. - She was like fucked up. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - Morning, Chlo. What's up? - God, I'm so embarrassed. Why the fuck did I do that? - No. - Shh. It's definitely okay. You just might have to do some damage control today. You know, like maybe you should just like call Jaimie and tell him, like, just get that in the way. - It's an in person conversation and like no rush. Take your time. - It, I also just feel like it doesn't have to be that big of a deal. You know like you didn't have sex, you just made out like- - Right, Jesus Christ. - I mean, you did say that maybe you wanted to break up with him. Like this could be like a catalyst- - You are stressing her out. - Like a conversation. Am I stressing you out? I, I don't mean to. I just, I think maybe it's like, let's nip this in the bud, you know and like, just tell him, and like get it out of the. - Let's just, let's just like watch a movie or something. - Did I say something? - Movie. - I'm doing my job search. - Hey. - Hey. Are you guys still at the cabin? - No, we just got back. Uh, how are you? How, how was Leila's birthday? How was the club? - It was fun. Um, how are you? - I'm good, I'm good. I think I'm just about to make some fajitas, and um, yeah, I miss you. - I miss you too. Look, I, I was just calling to say hi. - Well, hi. Is everything okay? - Yeah, I just feel really bad about yesterday. - Yeah, it's, I think it's best if we just forget it. - What do you mean? - I just don't want to stress you out and, and I don't want you have to worry about me. So just ignore everything that I said, 'cause you're right. - You don't wanna come with me? - No, I do. I just, I don't know how I'm gonna afford it, and I don't know what I do, and I hate cities so. - I want you to come with me. - What? - Yeah, yeah, we can like get an apartment like you said. - Okay. I guess, I guess I'm just confused because that's not what you were saying before. And, and I just, what, what changed? - I, I told you I needed to think about it, and I took some time and I thought about it. - Okay. - Can I come over tomorrow? We can talk about it then. - Yeah, yeah. Well, what are you doing tonight? - I'm going to dinner with my parents. - Okay, yeah, well, I'll, I'll just be here, so just come by whenever. - I love you. - I love you too. - Bye. - Bye. - What's going on, fellas? - Hey, hello. - I got Bella again. - Hey, good to see you. - Hey, Bella. - Hi. - Hi, Wyatt. - What you, uh, chefing up there? - Little bit of, uh, beef fajitas. - Okay, is there enough to go around. - There's plenty, yeah. You guys want some? - Yeah. - Would love. - Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you. - I'm sorry again about last night. That was really embarrassing. - No, it was, it was funny. - I don't usually drink like that. - Yeah. - I promise, seriously. - It's fine, it was cute. - Thanks for taking care of me though. - Of course. - No, it was nice. - Anytime. - So are you seeing anyone else? - I mean, I've like hooked up with this guy on my floor a few times. Nothing serious. I mean, I mean, we went to a formal. It was kind of fun. I like danced on a table and stuff. - Totally. Okay. Um, yeah, okay. - I like you though. - I like, I like you too. I've been having fun. - I mean, I'd like rather hang out with you, you know? - Yeah, cool. No, um, I'd, I'd like to hang out with you. I've been having fun. - Cool. - Yeah. - Cool. - I'm not seeing anyone, so no problems there. - So Drew, huh? I've never seen him that, uh, that excited about a girl before. It's kinda cool. You all right, man? - Yeah. - Just been kind of quiet. - Hello, no one is available to take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. Please leave a message after the tone. - Yo, Carly, will you just, I was super fucked up the other night, all right? I didn't mean any of that shit. Yo, Carly, can you please pick up the fucking phone? I, I've been trying to call you. We should just talk, okay? Just pick up the phone. - You good? - Yeah, I'm gonna head out. - No, wait. Where are you going? - I need some air. - Yeah, with the fucking keys. What are you stupid? You can't fucking drive, dude. - I need to talk to her. I've been calling her, she's not answering it, and she fucking blocked me. - Then leave it alone. Leave her alone, dude. - I, I think I really fucked up this time, all right? She's never, she's never cut me off like this before. And she might be done with me. I gotta go talk to her. - I'm sorry, dude. And I, it sucks. I'm sorry, but you can't drive. Okay, look at me. Hey, you can't drive. Can you talk to her in the morning? - I'm just all mixed up.

You shouldn't have gotten dragged into that. - No, it, it's fine, Drew. - No, I don't know what's fucking wrong with him. I swear to God. - Yeah. - You wanna come in? - Uh, no, I think I'm just gonna head back to the dorms if that's good. - Uh, um, you don't wanna come? - I probably shouldn't. - I could come with you. - I, Ivy's there. - All right, um.

It's gonna be fine. - You wanna get some pizza? - You, Wyatt, man, you just need to calm the fuck down sometimes. - Pizza? Drew, you can even choose since your girlfriend's probably gonna break up with you now. - All right. Fuck you guys. - It'll be fine, bro. - I fucking know. - Yo, Bella asked how you were doing. - I told you you were tweaking. - All right.
