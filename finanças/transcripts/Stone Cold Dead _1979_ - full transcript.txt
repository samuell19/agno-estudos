What were you doing in there? I'm a music lover. What do you do for kicks, Sergeant? I collect fish. Why? Because fish don't bark. It's the most profound thing I've ever heard about fish in my life. I suppose you're a working girl. I'm a hostess. Ah.And I do a little modeling. I imagine you take a very nice picture. You did a good job. Visitor, Mr. Kurtz. Send him in, Danny.Yes, sir. I'll wait for you outside. I couldn't help it, Mr. Kurtz. She pulled a knife on me. Willie, you're letting the ladies control you. It's supposed to be the other way around. You remember that. Well, it won't happen again. No. I swear, Mr. Kurtz. Willie, are you still here? Now. BOYD: Is that one of Kurtz's girls? TONY: Yeah. Bernice Carnival. Bust her down.

Well, look, the Inspector called. He wants us to check out Danny DeLeon. DeLeon, why? They just found a third body. Wet Willie with a .22 in his hand.Oh. DeLeon works for Kurtz. Maybe there's a connection with the Stevens' murder. Boyd, what the hell is it with you? Why is it always Kurtz? Maybe I don't like pimps. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Rosie! Yeah. What? Look, man, he can't fight. He can't box. He can't move. He can't punch. He can't do anything. The only thing that Limey can do is kiss the canvas. [SIGHS] Meet him in the ring? Or do you want me to meet him socially? No, man, I don't wanna buy no watch. Hey, Boyd, how are you, pal? Hey, Rosie. Good, man, good, good. So, what can I do for you? I'm looking for a black fighter, a cat named, uh, Danny DeLeon. You know him? Danny the Lion? He ain't no fighter, man. Hey, Danny. Listen, how come I don't see you around no more?

I'll tell you what the problem is. I don't know what the hell he's gonna do from one goddamned minute to the next. This is my life we're talking about here. Oh. [SIGHING] He's obsessed. He wants to turn every homicide into a crusade to clean up the city. Well, I'm a cop, I'm not a janitor. I'll look into it. Meanwhile, you take care of that shoulder, huh? [SIGHS] We're having you as the last man to make it with Claudia Grissom. The forensic tests prove that. Don't prove nothin'. Why would I do something like that? Tell me that, sucker. Claudia had something on Kurtz. She left your stable. You knew her habits. So, Kurtz hired you to hit her. Maybe Kurtz has got something on you. Just some chicken shit head games. Don't mean nothin' to me. Well, maybe you're not guilty of murder. Maybe you didn't actually pull the trigger on Claudia. But how does the name Wet Willie sound to you? How does "kiss my ass" sound to you, motherfucker? Oh, don't bother to stand up. You don't want the guard to think you pissed your pants. Guard! MAN ON RADIO: Police are baffled by the identity of the killer of Claudia Grissom, a former prostitute. This is the second such murder in less than 48 hours. Tuesday afternoon, Melody Stevens, 14, was shot to death in a downtown parking lot near the Grissom murder as she walked from a parked car. This brings the total to three homicides this week that police suspect may be linked. KXET's Murray Short has this report. MURRAY: I'm speaking to Inspector Webb of Homicide. Uh, Inspector, how similar are these killings to the Jack the Ripper murders? WEBB: First of all, ballistic evidence is inconclusive. It may be a possibility that the same murder weapon was involved. MURRAY: So then the Sin Sniper may be gunning for a fourth victim? OLIVIA: Hello.Hi. Who is it? It's me. Oh, hi. What do you want? Well, I thought we could get together for lunch. No, I can't.Please, I wanna talk to you. Okay. What about tomorrow? Can't you make it any sooner? All right. How about this afternoon on campus? Okay, fine. I'll be there. Was that your mother?Mmm-hmm. She wants you to move back in with her? Yes and, uh, I just can't handle it. Don't worry about her. I'll take care of her. This is Boyd in D-Eleven. I just spotted suspect on campus. I'm gonna stick with her. Ten-four. OFFICER: Ten-Four, D-Eleven. How come you get all the easy assignments? [INAUDIBLE] ♪ My friends Hi.Hop in, honey.

For a report, here's our Sunshine Girl, Debbie Lee. DEBBIE: Hi, Bob. Uh, there's an accident on the freeway and it's brought all traffic to a standstill. Hello, little girl. Would you like a ride in my shiny, silver car? Sure, Julie. How far? As far as you wanna go. DEBBIE: And that snowstorm, well, it's tapering off to snow flurries.

[PEOPLE CHATTERING] [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] Did any of you know Claudia Grissom? No, she was a loner. Aren't we all? Okay, wait, I'll tell you when. What about you? You? What? What do you do? I work for the city. [LAUGHING]That's cute. That's real cute. You know a dope dealer, whoremonger named Kurtz? Hey, I'm talking to you. Kurtz, Julius Kurtz. No. Why should I? I'm no hooker.

We can play it tough. Go soak your head on your face. Let go of me. BOYD: Since Kurtz moved in with his meat market, we've had a 45% increase in homicides, plus B and E's boosting the whole shot. I want you to move inside. I want you to check his girls out and I want you to bring him in. So, where's the evidence? You're looking at it. It starts with the peep shows, the jerk-off parlors. And then the pimps move in with the hookers. The junkies move in with the pimps. First thing you know we got a sewer instead of a city. Why Kurtz? Anyone could be the sniper. Even you, Sergeant. There's a lot of men out there who have a hate-on for women. Like the one that wasted Melody Stevens, 14 years old. When I went to tell her parents, her mother said, "Save the condolences." That's when I asked myself, what the hell am I doing out here? Rule number one, don't take it home with you. Knock that crap off. I don't take it home. I just do my job. So let me do mine. Look, MacAuley, I want Kurtz's nuts in a meat grinder, you got that? Yeah, yeah, I got that. Now you get this, Sergeant. I've been in undercover three years. I got guts, I got determination, and at times I even show a little initiative. And if you crowd me, I'll blow your shorts off. Stick it up your nose! MAN ON RADIO: Police are baffled by the identity of the Sin Sniper. Two prostitutes have been killed today, and that leaves... Julie, take me to Miami with you. No. Why? What do you mean, why?

No. No, thank you. What I want is a motive for these killings. Well, there probably isn't one, in the accepted sense. You're not dealing with your average killer. He's not motivated by jealousy, money or even sex. Oh, what is it then? Revenge. You look upon his murders as crimes of protest. [EXHALES] Against what? Against hookers? Against society. Every time he presses the trigger, he gets back at the society that has blocked his creativity. He finds self-expression through acts of violence. It's murder with a purpose, with self-definition of the goal. Self-definition. What kind of a goddamned motive is that? Every time he focuses his sights on a woman and shoots her, he knows who he is. Why, he's the Sin Sniper, like the papers say. And he doesn't feel guilty because he's not responsible. It's society that's to blame. Oh, I'm late for my 1:00 session.

[BOAT HORN BLOWING] [WATER RUNNING] MONICA: Why don't you get yourself a drink? Sure. Don't worry about me. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Don't answer that. [TELEPHONE RINGING CONTINUOUSLY] Why spoil a perfect evening, huh? Sure. Besides, I feel much safer with you sleeping here. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [COINS CLINKING] MACAULEY: You got the recorder? Yeah. Now I got something for you. I always knew Monica was involved. With you? Look, MacAuley. I don't need you investigating my life, all right? You know, I still feel like a shit when I nail someone who's become a friend. You all right? You need a backup? Nah, don't worry. I can deliver Kurtz for you. Yeah, but he's the wrong killer. He's not the sniper. [MACAULEY CHUCKLES] You're really something, you know that? You're the one that had the hots for Kurtz. Kurtz is a survivor. We're looking for a suicide case. But I still want his ass, MacAuley. So maybe we'll score a combination. If we do, I'll buy you a drink, a good long stiff one. What's the matter? I was just thinking how long it's been since I had a drink with a man I liked. Bye. [SIGHS] BOYD: Can I come in? MONICA: I guess so. Oh, you got a nice place. You've been here before. Look, what do you want here anyway? Oh, I thought I might be able to use your phone. I don't have a dime. My phone. [CHUCKLES] Go ahead. Use the white one. I gotta call my fish. What? Yeah, I know maybe this sounds strange, but you see, I got this mechanism hooked up and when I dial 922-4243, it activates this little gadget and my fish get fed. [PHONE RINGING] No, it really works. [PHONE RINGING]I'm not home much. What happens if somebody else dials the number? It's unlisted. Um, you got an unlisted number for your... [CHUCKLES] My God. You're really crazy. [PHONE RINGING] Look, uh, sorry about last night. Here. I started feeling sorry for myself. Needed some company. Well, I might have been able to provide that. [SIGHS] Maybe next time. Well, how about this time? What do you feel like doing? Something I haven't done in years. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BOYD EXCLAIMING] [BOTH LAUGHING] [MONICA CHUCKLES]Now, aren't you sorry we didn't go bowling? [EXHALING] I can't believe it. We've been together all evening, you haven't asked me any questions. I haven't had any breath all evening. [LAUGHING] How come you're separated? Oh? Since when did you get on my case? You just look like the kind of guy who'd like a steady thing. I thought so, too. Got any kids? No. Found out it took two. How about you? You just got the one? Yeah, Olivia. You must be very proud of her. Very pretty girl. Straight "A" student. Yeah, well, I don't think she approves much of me. So give it up, change your life. [MONICA SIGHS] Why are cops such pain-in-the-ass reformers? Did it ever occur to you that I'm very happy, that I don't wanna change my life? Hey. Hey. How'd you look with a moustache? I'll make you a deal. I won't try to change your life if you don't try to change my face, okay? [LAUGHING] Okay. Come on, Tinker Blades. Let's show 'em how. Haven't you ever heard the term "flatfoot"? [EXCLAIMING] I'll, uh, I'll give you a call, huh? Aren't you gonna come in? I'll take a rain check. Good night. Okay. [CHURCH BELLS CHIMING] Hi, Professor. What have you got for me? The lists. Who's Teddy Mann? I checked him out. He has a teaching fellowship at the University in photographic arts. He's here on a scholarship. Athletic?No, not really. Hmm, so Teddy likes taking pictures. It's too bad he doesn't like guns. I checked his record in the Army. Well, what do you know? Teddy's a sharpshooter. PROFESSOR: He studied photography in high school, got drafted and was recommended for a commission. He was refused, psychological instability. Apparently, he has become fond of one of his students. Her mother has complained of harassment to the faculty head. Oh, and I checked the cameras on loan from the university like you asked? Teddy's had one out for over a month. A Canon with a 135 millimeter lens. That's what he and his students use in class. Funny thing about the 135, there's only one cap that fits that particular lens. All the rest are interchangeable. I think you should have a word with him, Sergeant. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTERING ON TELEPHONE] [CAR ENGINE STARTING] TONY: Her name's MacAuley. She's a cop. KURTZ: Just like you. Yeah, just like me, except she's not on the take. Maybe she's not as smart as you. Listen, I don't want anything to happen to her, you understand? Of course, of course. We'll have to change the destination of the shipment. Where to? I'll tell you that tomorrow night. Same place? Yeah, processing plant. 1:00. [TAPE REWINDING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you like that. Like hell you didn't. You didn't hear me knock, that's all. [EXHALING] What's the matter anyhow? Nothing. Well, I don't understand what's been going on, you know? You've been acting really strangely lately. Oh, it's me, is it? Yes, you're goddamned right it's you. You've been avoiding me. And don't try and deny it. Teddy, I don't think I can go out with you tonight. Listen, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. I love you, you know? I was just afraid that... That what? That there was somebody else. No. There's no one else, Teddy. Will you turn the lights off when you go? [CHURCH BELLS CHIMING] KURTZ: There's a songbird about to sing some sour notes. You're going to have to stop her. DANNY: I'll do that, Mr. Kurtz. Enjoy yourself, Danny. Yes, sir, Mr. Kurtz. MAN: And what else? I don't recognize the voice. Boyd should be able to. It's probably somebody on the drug squad. It's a hit! [GUN SHOTS] [TRAIN HORN BLOWING] [SIREN WAILING] It should have been me, you know. What the hell are you talking about? If I hadn't quit on you. A hero. [SIGHING] Everybody wants to be a dead hero. [SIREN WAILING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] Boyd, I played ball with you. I've done things no other inspector would even consider and what have I got, huh? Three dead women, two police detectives murdered and a city that's petrified. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Yeah? I don't care if it's the mayor. Well, tell him I'm under heavy sedation, hmm? Okay. What have you got to say? Here, listen to this. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? That's terrific. Yeah. The police chief is coming over the... Where the hell do you think you're going? To say goodbye to a friend. Daddy, when can I drive your car? When you get older.Why? Because you're too small.Why? Because you're only four.Why? Dummy. All right, there you are. Go ahead. [MAKES CAR NOISES] And don't do any speeding. Okay, I won't, Daddy. [TONY LAUGHING] Hey, Boyd.Tony. How're you doing? Your hands are dirty.Oh. Yeah, I was just fixing Bobby's bike. [CHUCKLES] How about a coffee, huh? A little snort. No, no, thanks. I'm working. Oh, this isn't a social call, hey? All right. What is it? What is it? KURTZ: We'll have to change the destination of the shipment. TONY: Where to? I'll tell you that tomorrow night. Same place? Processing plant at 1:00. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. [SIGHS] Honest to God, I didn't know that would happen to her. No wonder we could never nail Kurtz. You always made sure we were at the right place at the wrong time. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] All my life I wanted to be a cop. But what did it get me? Peanuts. I go out and I bust those bastards. Throw 'em in the can. They'll be out the next morning and their three-piece suits laughing at me. So, what's the point? Cut the crap, Tony. You sold out. Yeah. [SIGHS] Not like you, huh, Boyd? You'll still be slugging it out till the bitter end, won't you? I'll wait for you in the car. [SOBBING] [CHILDREN CHATTERING] MAN 1: You gonna be my main butt boy. MAN 2: Hey, Julie, remember me in '73? MAN 3: I'll see you in the yard. I didn't tell 'em nothin'. BOYD: First-degree murder of two police officers. Accessory to two additional counts of murder and trafficking in heroin. You know, Julie, on you this looks good. I'll be out of here in 24 hours, Boyd. Not this time, Julie. Not this time. Twenty-four hours, Boyd. Twenty-four hours. [DOOR CLANGING SHUT] May I please have my glasses? Would somebody bring me my glasses, please? I can't see? OLIVIA: I'm confused. I don't know what to think. I'm sorry. Will you kill him? If I have to. I'd rather bring him in. He needs help. Does he? And what if he isn't the Sin Sniper? How can you be so sure? You have access to his photographic equipment? Mmm-hmm. I'd like you to check and see if he's missing a lens cap. Sergeant, are you afraid? Uh-uh. Are you? Why should I be? I mean, the Sniper only shoots whores, doesn't he? But that's all some men think about. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] MONICA: Good evening. Greta, would you seat them, please. Olivia. Oh, Mother, I've got to talk to you. Honey, I'm working. I'm so afraid. [DOOR OPENING] [LIGHT SWITCH CLICKING] [HUMMING] [HUMMING STOPS] Look, he has no one he can trust, [SIGHS] but he loves me. And you're my mother. And together we can talk him into giving himself up. You've got to call the police. No. They'll kill him. That's not my responsibility. Look, you know what I am. He'll kill me. You don't seem to understand, do you? No one seems to understand. And that's the problem. [SIGHS] Can I come home with you? Yes. Yes, you can come home with me and you can stay as long as you like. You'll be safe. I'd like that. WOMAN: [WHISPERING] Melody, Claudia, Bernice, Elvira, Monica. Melody, Claudia, Elvira, Monica. Melody, Claudia, Elvira, Monica, Melody, Claudia, Elvira, Monica. Melody, Claudia, Elvira, Monica, Melody, Claudia, Elvira. Claudia. Claudia. Bernice. Claudia. Elvira. Claudia. Monica. [CONTINUES WHISPERING] So good to have you here. Never get to see you anymore. [PHONE RINGING] Hello?BOYD: Monica? This is Boyd. Oh, hi. I didn't think I'd hear from you again. Well, look, Monica, I've gotta talk to you. I need your help. Yeah, I thought it might be business. Look, I'm just on my way to put some flowers on Bernice's grave. BOYD: No. No, I've got to talk to you now. I'll be right over. Look, I gotta go out for awhile but I'll be back as soon as I can. No, don't go. Honey. I know we haven't been very close in the past, but, maybe it's not too late. I'm afraid. [SIGHS] You don't have to be afraid. This place is locked up tight. Nobody can get in here. I'm afraid. For you. Inspector, it's Boyd. I got a hunch that Monica Page is the next to get hit. WEBB: [SIGHS] I'm tired of your hunches, Boyd. I want facts. Then give me six men on standby. Boyd. Boyd, if you screw this up, I'll make sure that you're out on the... [CAR ENGINE STARTING] Monica? Monica? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Monica. MAN: Hey.[EXCLAIMS] Oh. I'm sorry, ma'am. You can't go in there. MONICA: Go ahead. Shoot. I don't like the end. Oh, my God! I've given birth to a monster. A monster's ugly. I've never met a man that didn't want me, like your friend, the super-cop. Oh, God, Olivia. He was easy. What the hell are you trying to prove? There aren't very many girls who kill their mothers. Are you proud? Of what? My mother's a whore? What does that make you? [LAUGHS] That makes me a sniper, Mother. Not a victim. I've done more to clean up this fucking town than your cops and all the politicians put together. Your little baby girl. I've got this whole fucking city shook up. Olivia, it's wrong. [SCOFFS] Wrong? [LAUGHS] You're the last one to talk to me about morality, Mother. "So go thou and slay "and when thou returnest, "my angels shall bear thee to paradise." Olivia, freeze, don't do it. [INAUDIBLE] [GUN SHOT] Keep him here. I want him where he's safe. Don't hurt her. [SIREN WAILING] BOYD: Come on. When did you know? I think I always knew. I just couldn't face it. Take care of her. OFFICER: Hold your positions. Sniper heading towards the railway yard. Repeat, sniper heading in your direction. Stand by. [GUN FIRING] [TRAIN RUMBLING] [BELL DINGING] [GUN FIRIES] [GUN SHOOTS] OLIVIA: I could have nailed you, Boyd. So, I'm warning you. Don't come after me. BOYD: Olivia, there's gotta be another way. Not for me. [SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE] [SIRENS APPROACHING] Olivia? You hear that? They're all around us. There's nowhere to run. Don't do it, Sergeant. I don't wanna do you. That's funny. I was gonna say the same thing. [SIRENS WAILING] Put it down. Why? Because I know something about walking on the outside. Olivia, I want to help ya. Give me the gun. You want me? Yeah. Alive. [LAUGHS] They all want me. Let me help.The whole fucking city wants me! [SOBBING] But you, you could have me for free. [FIRES GUN] Olivia, no! [THUDS] [SIREN WAILING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] TEDDY: Let me through. Boyd! Let him through. Hmm. WEBB: The city should be proud of us on this one. Hey, Boyd. Stick around. Take a few photos. Don't let this go to your head. MURRAY: Murray Short, Inspector, from KXET. How did you catch the Sin Sniper? WEBB: Well, we found her boyfriend who works at the University. His cooperation led us to her. It's a typical example of the police force working with the public, for the public. MURRAY: Thank you, sir.WEBB: Thank you. Murray Short live, on KXET.
