P A R A D I S E Shit, I thought there was someone there. There's no one. I bumped into Sarah's mother, the other day. So what happened? She glared at me! She'd gladly send me to hell! What do you expect? You're fucking her daughter! I'm splitting. Someone could still come. At this time of night there won't be anyone. Could I stay at your place tonight? My old man's coming today. Sure, OK. How can you sleep with that light in your face? A piece fell off the roof. - Joaquin! - Yes, Mum? - Are you taking care of Edu tomorrow? - Nope. I'm leaving early, with Pato. Where are you going? He found me a job. Your old lady's really great, She deserves a medal. You tell me now if they need more people. I'm sick of the recycling plant. Look at my hands... Sara will never want them near her face. I'm gonna blow up that lamp-post! Stop complaining and go to sleep. Did Pato say what sort of job it was? No. Just that it was in a restaurant. The 15th anniversary of the "Gardens of Paradise" celebrated with exceptional guests. This year's organizers have promised the presence of renowned musicians. Be prepared! Hi guys! Hi. You coming too? You're late. What are we doing? "Chicken man" has money. What? Are you playing cheapskate? I'm not a cheapskate. I can't come to the disco. I have to go home early. You're really not funny. What's the problem? I promised my mother that I'd go to the market... ...with her early in the morning. Then we'll go see a film. I'll pay. But we share for drinks and cookies. No, if you invite, you pay everything. Alright, go and get it. Only today. A large bottle. A Coke and 2 packets of cookies. Hey, Lalo, get rid of your old man. He comes to you because you drink too. Buzz off, pisspot! I was a soldier! Have some respect! Scram! You're a terrorist, that's for sure! Go fuck yourself! That guy's amazing. How does he still stand up?! Was he really a soldier? In Ayacucho, during the terrorist time. He told my father how they once went to a village far from here. They gathered the residents in the square. Know why? The commander took a terrorist's head out of a bag... ...and forced everyone to play football with it. - Just the head? - That's bullshit! It's true. If they refused, he threatened to jail them. Amazing. With a head? It wouldn't bounce! Imagine receiving a pass... ...and the ball looks at you! I could never have done that. But you had to... Otherwise off to the clink... With dogs with big noses and a big mouth ready to bite you. Damn, that would hurt! It sure would! Let's see how it goes. Let's go, otherwise there'll be no places. Come on, Rambo, we're going to see a film. Wait for me. Terrorists killed Sara's father. Yeah. That's really fucking shitty. She was only a baby when they killed him. She must look like her old man... She looks nothing like her mum. Her mother says she looks like her dad. Have you seen the ad for the army, I told you about? Yeah, I did. What do you think? Would you want to apply? I wanted to talk to Joaquin about it too. As soon as I get my pay, I'll look into it. Do it as soon as possible. Are you sure you don't want to come upstairs? Yesterday not enough for you? No. I'd like to, but I can't. My mum's waiting for me. Mum? Mum? I'm a bit late. I helped Antoinette with her homework. Is it true that no one wanted to take Che Loco to hospital? Yeah. - Here's to Che Loco. - Cheers. Do you ever dream that you're flying? Like what? That you're flying, like Superman. Leave her alone! Shut up and go on making out with her. Go ahead! Sure, I dream about it all the time. Great... Everyone has that dream except me. Che Loco dreamed about it all the time. Really? Go on... drink, you idiot! I'm going for a piss. Come on, fight, damn you! - Who's coming? - The Cajamarquilla guys. Joaquin! Hey, wanker! The Cajamarquilla guys are coming! Joaquin! Fucking idiot! Come on, Lalo, more effort! Look how Sanchez is doing it. I knew I'd find you here. Come outside for recess. I'm preparing a presentation. Why don't you help with the swimming pool? You should spend more time on your schoolwork. You're interested in everything that happens around here... ...but do you really care that much about school? Do you really think that? The teacher doesn't want to give lessons. How are they going to fill the pool? There's no water. Didn't you hear what the teacher said? Of course, you finish this year... You don't help anyone. Fucking selfish. You only think of yourself. You're wasting my time. Bye bye. Idiot! Sara. Sara! Yes, Mummy? Go to Victoria, next door... ...and ask her for a big packet of washing powder. I'll pay her on Saturday Anything else? Do we have sugar and rice? I think so. So that's it. Mummy... Would grandma have a photo of Dad, maybe? No. I already told you... The only photo there was, was when we were married. It got burned when we ran away. The other day, my friends asked me if I looked like my dad. What did I tell you? That's what I told them, too. And what else did you say? Nothing, just that. Just be careful that you don't say too much. The terrorists can come back. They ask questions, make inquiries... and as your dad worked for the government... ...we have to be very cautious. You never know what those damn terrorists are after. Really? That's what I was told by the man who sells fruit, the other day. Go and do that, now... it's getting late. I'm going. Give us plenty of noodles and a nice helping of meat. I'm giving you a big helping. Where did you have stitches? They chipped in to pay for it. And you... didn't you hear me calling you? You were already gone. And then I couldn't find you. You've got quite a hole there! Don't touch it! If Sara sees you, you're fucked. She'll make an even bigger hole! She'll only be mad at me for a few days. You might say that now... Could be blubbering afterwards! Shut your gob! Then I hit him back. He thought I was running away because he'd got me in the head. But with Chachete, we put him on the ground. He was lucky, I didn't have my knife... ...otherwise I would've stuck that pig. I fucking would. Wait a sec... Holy shit! Look over there. - Help me! - Holy shit! - It's still wet! - Take it! He heard us! Shit, run! - Everything fine? - All OK, Boss. Here, Cholito. Thanks, Boss. Cholito.... this was your last day. Why? What did I do? I've come every day, and I was always early. That's it, Cholito. Why do you want to fire me, Boss? Do you want to work for nothing? I can't afford to pay you anymore. I'm sorry. Do you need a waiter, Boss? Or a dishwasher? Leave me your phone number. I'll call you if something becomes available. I don't have a phone... ...but I can check with you. Come by in 2 weeks. There may be something. Bye. Don't worry, you'll find something else. Johnny, can I take the bones? - Sure. - Thanks. He's going to get sick with all those bones. He might enjoy it anyway. Eat, Rambo... ...there won't be any tomorrow. He'll take you on as a waiter? He won't have anything for me. I was sick of the place, anyway. Do I want to sweat in there?! Sara wants Mario to join the army. Join up with him. I don't like the idea. That's it, Rambo. Scram! What do you want to do? When Che Loco died, you wanted to leave. I don't know. Sometimes I want to leave, sometimes not. Why would you want to stay here? - It's out neighbourhood. - Does it feed you? We have to acquire some skills so we can leave here. That's what I want to do after school. I want to learn at least two trades. I don't know. You DO know, but you're just fooling around. I'm going, I have to swot up for an exam. Tell Mario that Sara doesn't want to see him. Anything left to eat? Yeah, help yourself. What's happening? Why are you unhappy? What's the long face for? Why do you think that? What's happened? You look really sad. The job at the restaurant's over. Why? Why did they fire you? No reason. The guy's nuts. So where are you going to work now? I don't know yet. Stay here tomorrow and take care of Edu... while I go to work. Okay. You wash yourself. Bend down, and wash yourself Come here. Shoot it, shoot it! Come here. Stand over there. Do a header. Shoot it... Go on! Little shit... Also the bucket, please. Thank you. Hurry up, I have to help Mum. I'm coming. Can you lend me money for the bus? What for? To go with you. Why? Are you getting ready for it? I don't really know. In case... I've no money... Antoinette pays for me. What's the matter? Nothing. Coming? Just a moment. Mum, we're going. Sarah's coming with me. Don't be late for school. Don't worry. - Bye, ma'am. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Can you lend me some money? - Don't you have an exam? - That's easy. But you still get bad grades. Come in, Rambo. - You'll get a scholarship, won't you? - We'll see. The best students get one. That's why I have my notebook with me. Does your mother know what you want to study? No, I'll tell her when I'm sure. Go on, get on! Time's up, the exam is over. Hand them in. Come on, hand them in. See you at the next subject. How was it? So-so... pretty hard, actually. How much longer? Another couple of minutes, I think. Another two minutes. - It's been a long time. - Yeah. When did the circus get here? This morning. It seems like it's better than last time. They have two sheep and a monkey. I hope it'll be better. The last couple of times it's been really shitty. Do you remember last time? It looked like a brothel, not a circus. Keep playing, he didn't do anything to you. He didn't even touch you, fatso. - Shut up, bird-brain! - Just you wait! You'll see, when I'm playing! We'll play for 5 soles. They should have enough money. They've won 3 games. Stay there Edu, I'll buy you some cookies. It's time... here we go. You mind him, OK? Hi Edu, who's that ugly guy? We lost because of you, you spastic! You fucked up, you arsehole. Come on, we're playing. Edu, watch! Mum, while I was cleaning today... ...I found my schoolbooks. My class is finishing this year. I'm thinking, I could finish school. I'm just short one year. If we talk to the headmaster, it could be arranged. O.K. I'll help you at the market in the morning... ...and go to school in the evening. Very well. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Mummy? Are you alright, Mummy? Joaquin! Hey, dummy! Joaquin! What is it? Could I sleep at your place for a few days? Come in. Keep quiet or you'll wake my mum. Come on. You got anything to drink? No. What's happened? That arsehole kicked me out. He said he couldn't afford me. As if it would save him a lot of money. He spends all his money on whores. - Your old lady say nothing? - Nothing at all. I thought she'd defend me. But nothing. I'll show him! He'll see! And Sara's not speaking to me. Antoinette told me. But she'll soon forget about it. What are you doing now? I'll see. Tomorrow at the recycling plant... I'll make enough for the weekend. It's gone... That's cool, you plugged the hole. You saw? Every time I pass by here... ...I wonder if under these ruins... ...there's no hidden gold, like in other places. Imagine if we found a solid gold goblet! We'd be millionaires! We'd sell it, and no need to work! They've probably dug it all up already. All that's left is garbage. I don't think so. There's sure to be something still there. You have to kill a dog and eat it raw. Did you see that story? It was to show that you'd become a man. The soldiers caught a dog in the camp. They cut it in two and drank its blood. You want to join the army? If they paid me every month for that sort of crap. But they lock you up. Only the first few months. Are you going to join up too? Have your hair cut short?! Get your fucking hands off! Go and dig your hole, instead of pissing us off! I'm going for a piss. Did you see the new chick at the bar? No. Really hot. I saw her with some drunk guys. She can really take her liquor. Where's she from? No idea. I hope to meet her. Looks like an easy lay. Are you sure there are people up there? Yeah, and they'll be out soon. Why don't you give it a try with Antoinette? What? She's a bit skinny, but no matter. Sara told me she was still a virgin. Don't be so silly. Get into her before someone else takes her. Forget it. We're just friends. If she wasn't such a friend of Sara's... ...I would've done it already. But she's a bit difficult, eh? Yeah. How many are there? I can't tell. There is only one. Go that way, I'll go this. Alright. Cool shoes! Where'd you get them? Bigmouth! Order something. On me. Cool! My mum didn't have time to cook. What time is it? You still have time for school. Hey... a menu for my friend. With lots of potatoes. The young man is too thin. Could you do me a favour before we go? Sure. Do you still have one e-mail? One e-mail? I have to send it another 20 people. And if you don't? Bad luck or a curse could happen to you. A man in Panama didn't do it. Two days after, he lost his job. Then his daughter died of a weird disease. A woman in Uruguay did it... ...and a week later, she won the lottery. Is it true? You can never be sure. What will I say to Mario? She won't talk. I'm talking to Sara, not you. Let him still suffer... That way he won't start again. When I want to talk to him, he'll know. He's suffering a lot. And drowning his sorrows at the Loca Charo. You sound like a bitter old woman. Oh shut up! You've got 5 minutes. Are you staying? Just about finished. Attention families of Paradise Gardens. Today is the premiere of Circo Magico. A show for the whole family... ...with trapeze artists, jugglers, acrobats... ...and the absolutely breathtaking Flying Spider... We should take a look. Yeah, sure. Mario, go help your girlfriend with her trolley. Go fuck yourself! Families of Paradise Gardens... A Circo Magico announcement... Second whistle, second call... Second whistle, second call... In 15 minutes the great show begins. All under the Circo Magico big-top. There's Antoinette. Hi guys. Hi. When does it start? The second whistle blew. In 15 minutes. How much to get in? 2 soles. - Shall we talk up there? - Okay. Don't be long, because of your mother. Yeah. See you later at Mayra's. Yeah, go ahead. She'll never learn. Hey... is it true that Myra is pregnant by Christian? - A lot of gossip. - Go on, tell us! - Don't be like that. - Well... - I'll buy you some popcorn. - What with? A big clap for the girls! Now I need a brave man. A brave and manly guy! It'll get dangerous. Somebody? From over there...? Are you all wimps? No one? Where are you? Here he is! Come this way, dear Sir. A round of applause for the gentleman! Come through here. Get over here and get ready. Look! A gatecrasher! No papers? It's goodbye to you! Come here. Hold on tight, my friend, This won't happen to you every day. Have fun! Hang on by the waist. Ready! Music, Maestro! Let's go! I'll see what I have to do to enlist. It's the best thing to do. Your mother will stop pestering you. Yeah. And you tell your mother I'll be a technician in the army. That'll placate her and stop her talking shit about me. After a while, she'll accept it. Will they send you somewhere else? Certainly at the beginning. But only for a few months. What if there's a war? Against who? There's no war here. Mum says the terrorists are returning. She's been traumatized by them.... That's why she says that. It's idiotic. Will you miss me, when I'm gone? A lot. A lot? Lots and lots! Drop your pants. Take her to the hotel! Ladies and gentlemen... the moment has arrived... to present our main attraction. Here is the breathtaking... ...Flying Spider! Ladies and gentlemen... Our acrobat is about to take a leap into the void... ...defying death itself! Watch him! That was the performance... ...of the breathtaking Flying Spider! - What's happening? - We're going up the hill. What for? Mario has a plot of land. You know that. No, I didn't know that. Let's go. Come on, Rambo. I'd really love to have a house here. I just found out. So why don't you have one, Joaquin? You want to stay here. There must be Inca treasures around here. When the Spaniards arrived... ...the Incas hid all the treasures... ...and buried them here. Liar! You believe that bullshit? Wouldn't it be too much to find gold! You wouldn't be able to do anything with it. Of course, I'd leave it where it was. I'd buy a house with a pool. Don't you believe me? Why is there a head of an Inca up there? How much does champagne cost? 18 soles. Too expensive. And the other over there? 11 soles. - We could fill a bottle with water. - That brings bad luck. Everything brings bad luck! How much do you have? Only 5.50. - Take this one. - No, has to be glass. Here's an anisette. That'll do. Thanks. We're going, Rambo. Come on, Rambo! It looks like you're not fighting anymore! Welcome to my new house. Wonderful. What did your mother say? - We'll buy something to drink. - Yeah. We should have drunk that bottle! We'll all chip in. I'm flat broke. Ladies and gentlemen... ...here now is the breathtaking Flying Spider... ...who is getting ready to go... ...as high as the height of the tent will allow him. Let's encourage him with our applause. How about that! That was the performance... ...of the breathtaking Flying Spider! Hey, pal.... the show's over. Joaquin. Why do you go to the circus so often? You probably have a girlfriend there. Stop it, Mum! Antoinette should be your girlfriend. Just let me eat. She's a nice girl... ...and a good student. Concentrate on finding husbands for your girls. You really should marry her. Give me a break! What's the matter? Are you the Spider Man? Yeah, why? Well, I... Could you... ...teach me how to do stuff on the trapeze? What if you fall? No matter. Shit. You're going to repeat your year. I still have a term where I can catch up. Pen and paper. Are you going to school or not? Must it be identical? No, so long as it's similar. Tomorrow's Che Loco's birthday isn't it? Yeah. How the hell can it survive? There must be water under it. It's totally dry here. There must be some, deep down. Otherwise it'd be dead. If there was any water there... ...there'd be some more trees. We're still too late. I hope he'll like it. Don't leave it here. The ranger will drink it. Oh, shut up! Let's pray for Che Loco... ...and take advantage of praying for us too. Did Che Loco really like going here? Yeah, it was his favourite place. Where would you go to celebrate my birthday? - In the snack bar? - No way, man! - The swimming pool? - Oh, shut up, dummy! - On the hill? - On the block of land. I'll go there every night to play football. Why do people always talk about death? We all die some day. You like talking bullshit. Fucking shit! - Come here... put this on. - Why? So you don't shit your pants, man! Are you getting good crowds? Not really. It's like everywhere. We'll stay till the anniversary day. There may be more spectators. If they come, will you stay a bit longer? Don't think so. The truck is already booked for Sunday. If you fall, it's up to you. No problem. Must be a terrific sensation. What? When you come on like Spider-Man... ...and get all that applause. At first, yes, but you get used to it. I'd be feeling... ...that they're all proud of me. Stop your chattering and get on up there. Grab the trapeze and hold it. Like that. That's good. Hold on really tight. Don't worry, I've got you. OK. let go. Go on, let go... Just let go! Don't worry, I've got you. On three, you let go. Let go. One... two... But I want to study journalism. If my grades are good enough at the end of the year... ...I'll get a half-scholarship. And the other half? Dad said he'd pay. You don't understand. He'd do it, if it was worthwhile. He won't waste money. But my dear boy... Why would you study that? Where would you find work as a journalist? It's a job for people who are well off, and influential. Is there anyone here who's a journalist? Or who works on TV? You'd be better off becoming a teacher. I don't want to. I wouldn't like it! Can't you understand? That's enough! Talk to Dad, he'll help you understand. In the sanctuary of Pachacamac... ...they found gold, silver, and a great number of idols. Come in. Excuse me a moment... Heredia, please come outside. Hurry up, Heredia! This time you're really in the shit. As I was saying, the Spaniards came and took away the gold and silver. Then they started to migrate southwards. In Cuzco they'd discovered that it was the empire's capital... ..and there were great treasures. Little shit, you're not going to get away with it! What do you good-for-nothings want? You want him to come drinking with you? Get the hell out of here, damn you! Don't let me catch you here again! Fucking brain-dead garbage! You shit-bags! Scram! Get a job! Far away! She sent him to her brother's in San Juan de Lurigancho. She didn't want him here anymore. He was stupid, he only thought of the swimming pool. Let's go, the guys are already waiting for us. It seems like there'll be fireworks. Come on, don't be silly! You go ahead. I'll maybe come a bit later. Talk with the guy at the market stall Tomorrow or Monday, I'll talk to the manager about it. 'Bye. Ladies and gentlemen... ...in just a few minutes... ...it will be the moment... ...for us to launch the fireworks... ...to celebrate the anniversary... ...of the Paradise Gardens community. There will be orchestral accompaniment. She's drunk a lot. Yeah, no one can keep up with me. What do we do with her? You take her. What can I do with her? I've no idea where she lives. She wanted to get to know you. You wanted to get to know him, eh Betty? - Yeah. - You see? The arsehole who killed Che Loco is coming! Come on, let's go! And with us... this evening... ...the great Carlos Falconí... ...accompanied... ...by the young... ...Vincente Mansilla on the guitar. A round of applause for Les Hermanos del Ande! And for Carlos. Thank you very much, dear friends. A big thank-you for this invite. Tonight we're celebrating 15 years of this community! Do not forget that we are alive today... ...because we escaped the hell of what was Ayacucho at the time. For all of you who have escaped the grip of violence... ...we dedicate “Huerfano Pajarillo”. Ayacuchano, little orphan bird, how did you get here in these foreign lands? Ayacuchano, little orphan bird, how did you get here in these foreign lands? Go up there, fly to Ayacucho, there where your parents mourn your absence. Go up there, fly to Ayacucho, there where your parents mourn your absence. Fucking arseholes! What were you missing in your home? You had enough tenderness and caresses. Here we go, Mum. What were you missing in your home? You had enough tenderness and caresses. But the tyranny of poverty wanted to imprison you in its clutches. But the tyranny of poverty Leave me alone! No... please! Mummy! Are you alright, Mum? What have I done, for them to do this to me?! Leave me alone. Don't touch me! Mummy! - Mummy, what's wrong?! - Leave me alone! Leave me alone, damn it! Mummy... Mummy, it's me, calm down! Mummy! Mummy! Calm down, Mummy! Mummy, calm down! - Mummy! - Have mercy! Have mercy! Have mercy! A soldier was coming in... Another was going out. On was going out. One coming in, one going out. One coming in, one going out. One inside, another outside. All night long. I thought that I'd be giving birth to a monster. Come this way. Come on! Keep coming! Mario! Mario! I borrowed them from Percy... ...to see what I'd look like in the army. What? Doesn't the uniform suit me? Don't you like it? - What's the matter? - Nothing. What is it? Nothing Sara's making inquiries about getting a stall at the market. Great. For selling gelatin or mazamorra. I'm leaving. I'll come and visit you. You tell me where you are. O.K.
