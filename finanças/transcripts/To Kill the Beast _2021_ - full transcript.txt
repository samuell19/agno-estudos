Hello Mateo, it's me. I've been thinking of what happened with you. I wanted to talk to you. TO KILL THE BEAST Remember the song she used to sing to us? I'm going, going, going, going through the highway... I'm going, going, going, going through the highway... You have reached: Mateo. At this moment we can't answer. Please leave your message after the beep. Hello Mateo. Will you pick up? Since mom died... I've been thinking of what happened with you. I wanted to talk to you. I will stay at the aunt's. See you there. So... Are you staying for a long time? Sorry? If you are staying for a long time. I don't understand you. Oh, sorry. You're coming from Buenos Aires? Yes. We could hang out one day. Did you already cross to Brazil? No, not yet. Here, the border is just a line in the map. It's that easy. You live there? Yes. My brother's also on the border. His name is Mateo Otero. Do you know him? No. That way. Thank you. Leave, I won't sign. No! The nagging is endless. Ines. I'm tired of them. The last thing I need is them sending the Prefecture. No! If they come, I'll kill everybody. I'm tired. I thought you were picking me up at the station. I don't have work for you at the hostel. This is a private property. This is my house. It feels like an invasion. They come any time. I can do anything. I don't need you. I'll do whatever you ask. Hallway. Kitchen. Another hallway. There's no cellphone reception here. The radio works poorly. You might get one Brazilian channel on the TV. Don't knock on the tenant's door. Don't speak to them unless they speak to you. And if you see anybody getting close to the jungle, don't let them in. Please. Hello Mateo, I'm here. Do you love me? Yes. When are you leaving? As soon as possible. Excuse me, baby! Ernesto. Excuse me. What? Yes? I'm looking for Mateo Otero. Is he around? Are you from the news? No. Lautaro, Lautaro! Lautaro, Lautaro, wait! Lautaro, I need to talk to you. Hold on for a second, Lautaro! Come back! Excuse me. I'm looking for Mateo Otero. Is he around? Well... Nice ass. Hello! Hi. I have no reception. Well, we're at the border. Can I borrow your phone? Sure. You have reached: Mateo. At this moment we can't answer. Please leave your message after the beep. Hey, it's me again. I'm not leaving until I can talk to you, so... Keep this. It's the church's phone number. We are getting together over there. Are you staying at Ines's, right? What happened? They say a beast appeared in town, a week ago already, that has been wandering around that land. Some say it's the spirit of an evil man, everyone's talking about it. That it turns into different animals. And what does it do to you? The worst. I think you should be careful. Good morning! Hi. How are you? -Fine. Are you planning on staying long here? About a month. I need to fill the register. Breakfast is not included. Where can I get it? There's a place a few blocks away. Ok. Fine. And there are some rules I'll explain later. Sure. No problem. So what are you doing here? -I came to visit. I came to visit friends. Show her the room. She can have one of the empty ones. Hello! I'm Julieth. Come. Here it is. It's nice. I arrived yesterday. It's pretty quiet. I thought they were shared. Yes, but it is quite empty so we can have separate rooms. I'm next door. Are there more guests? Yes. If there's anything you need, let me know. Not sure what the problem is with this things. They keep breaking. First the clocks, got fogged. Then the compass, the radio. Now this light. My sister says it's not good to be here. It's better if I stay somewhere else. What about my brother? I don't know. He's not around anymore? He's not. I know nothing about him. I know you don't want me to speak with him, I just want to know why he's not answering the phone. Why don't you go and have Champagne with Rivotril like your mother? You're so selfish. I said... I said you are selfish. I mean it. If you don't want, then don't go. I'm going to find him. You have nothing to say to him? I don't know what you think it's going to happen there. Okay. It makes me very unhappy that you are so naive. I though you were happy. Only stupid people are happy. I'm sure our aunt doesn't even want to see you. OPEN FROM 2pm TO 4pm FRONTIER CHECKPOINT Listen! I don't want to see any ladies by themseleves! Find someone with flashlight or a machete and go in pairs! Did you hear me? If you see anything, shout. Don't go there on your own. Make signs to let us know where you are. How come nobody found anything? No one else should be at risk. Not our sisters, nor our daughters. Nobody! Cintia, Liliana, Tania, Esmeralda, Patricia... Already ten people said they saw a beast in the wild. Our daughters are in danger! Are we going to stop it or not? People don't belong in bags. They belong in their homes. Alive In their jobs. Alive. Married, single, free. Where are our authorities? Motherfuckers! They act as if we didn't exist! Now, we are the law! That wild animal will pay! It will pay! We are the law! It will pay! I'm scared of everthing. Of everyone. Shadows. Bodies. Kisses. One summer my brother Mateo started bringing his friends from the club, home. They were punching everything. Starting with the doors. They did whatever they wanted, laughing. Mateo was... ...an agressive man. More than usual. Every day was worse. I wanted to leave the house. Mom sent him over here and I never saw him again. Do you fear me too? I don't know yet. You rascals! I'll shoot you! Come here! Come closer, you cowards! Fucking asshole! You think I can't see you? Fuck! I don't know how things keep breaking. Radio. This light. Hello... Fools! Leave! Don't come back! What do you think? Morons! Come on! Come on! Stop it! Stop it. Are you copying me? No! Are you copying me? You are copying me! -You are copying me! Come on! Stop it. Julieth! You are so annoying! Not you too... Just in case, don't go into the wild at night. Come on, sing! She came warmed up, now I'm boiling... She came warmed up, now I'm boiling... Hi, how are you? Today I was thinking about you, wanted to know... how you were, how things were. Tell me something, will you? I miss you here. And my brother? I'm sick of your evasion. So? Listen to me. Being part of the same family, doesn't dictate that we have to love each other. There's awful people in fact. Bad people. Sometimes one has more... communication with total strangers. People you may run into at the supermarket. Because blood ties are worthless, if there's no empathy. Or what do you think? Your mother... Did she ever feel anything... for me? On the contrary! She wanted to impose herself! To subdue me. It never occurred to her to ask me anything. Not even how I was. When people cause you pain its better to stay away. You have reached: Mateo. At this moment we can't answer. Please leave your message after the beep. Turn it up. Come! Everyone! Leave! I can't stand you not picking up the phone. I told you there's no reception in the border. -You never told me that. Wait. Stay still. Let me read. Emilia! Nine, eight, seven... One, four. -No! No. The other one. That's Mateo's. I call all the time there. Five, five... Two... one... Nine, nine. Two. One, four, thirteen. Three, one. What? Hello! I'm calling because I found a dog. This number was on his nametag. Jesus! I think they found our dog! Did he pick up? -You keep inserting coins. Hello. Jesus here. Hello, I'm Emilia. Can I talk to Mateo? Is the dog there then? How do I speak to him? I know the name tag says his name, but I'm keeping it. It's mine now. You don't give away a dog. Don't hush me. What color is the dog you're talking about? Look, Emilia. Yes, that is Mateo's dog. But he hasn't come back to his house for a week. Nobody knows anything about him. But what? I swear! I'm the one who is feeding his dog. I live next door. Give him the dog. I'll give you the dog if you take me to Mateo's house. Stay there. Look, it's been like this for a week. Ugh, there's a bird. You have 11 new messages. Hello! Hello? Remember the song mom used to sing to us? I'm going, going, going, going through the highway... and I'm not in a hurry. I'm going, going, going, going through the highway... and I'm not in a hurry. I'm going, going, going, going through the highway... I'm not afraid of you.
