Atmospheric compression. Discovery Houston, you're a go at throttle up. Roger Houston, going throttle up. Throttling back up to 104 percent. All engines showing 104 percent at this time. So... Angus. New meds should help the Transient Ischaemic Attacks. TIA, Atrial Fibrillation, Angina. Well you know the score. Doctor Kumar is back next week and I'll fill him in. Any more dizziness? Breathlessness, fainting? No. No more driving. You live alone? Just moved in with my daughter. Excellent. Keep up the good fight, Angus. Because what's the alternative? Hey. How ya doing, Rosie? Granddad? Can I look? Yeah, as long as you stop calling me granddad. Wow! Looks so close. Yeah. Like you can reach out and touch it. People have been looking up at the stars forever. And I think it's always for the same reason. What? To see where we belong. That's a question I've been asking myself my whole life. I wish I could be an astronaut. You can. You can be anything you want. They only want smart people. Well, you're smart. I got a D in math. Hey, I wasn't very good at math myself. Rosie used to say, 'on every special occasion, you make a wish.' and that comet, that's a special occasion. Dad says wishes don't come true. He does? Hmm. Finally got his telescope out of the shed. That's good. Hey don't forget you have homework tonight. Maybe Angus can help you out. - Yeah, I'll finish it. - Wait, I can help him. Here, dad. Should you be drinking that? Your heart. It's good for his heart, enjoy dad! Thanks. Angus! Come here! I've been summoned. It's him! Tonight in our studio, We have the billionaire, entrepreneur, Marcus Brown making a very special announcement. Marcus. You've spoken about how your father always supported your passion to go into space. Well, he always believed everyone should have a chance to achieve their dreams. He died recently... And the Ventura competition will honour his memory a lottery to choose someone who dares to dream big. And the prize? A two-week journey to space on the first commercial space plane. We'll pull twelve names from the lottery hat then the public votes and for the winner. Who will join six other- ANGUS: Turn it up! - Are you ready? - We're ready. The competition is live now. So get your entry in before midnight on Friday. Our March the 1st launch is coming up fast. And I could be taking you. It's started! You know how many runways there are that are that long in the whole country? Maybe two or three. And they need that length because this ship takes off like an aeroplane and it's fuelled by liquid hydrogen. Boy, they must have done some serious reinforcement to that original runway. Got to have the right road. Some have said you've taken risks in order to be the first commercial space flight. Everything has an element of risk. But, safety is our first priority. Always. Angus, look that this. If you win, companies pay you money. Look at that. Age requirement, eighteen to sixty-five. You should sign up. Barney. It's a lottery. It's like winning a lottery. They need people who are fit or in shape, you know, they don't want old. You could look sixty-five. No, I couldn't. Good night, Marcus. Have a good night. You stay here. You wait for mommy. Angus, don't forget about the competition. Bye mom! Hey, the tutor- - the money for the tutor. - Hey. Got it, okay. Thanks, dad. What was the name of that doll you had god, you carried it everywhere, that mom bought you? Patty. Patty, right. Because you had to pat her before she burped. Dad, the realtor thinks that we should lower the price on the house. Maybe I won't sell her. It's just all the debt Mom got into. Aw she didn't know what she was doing when she did that, she was not in the right mind. What kind of company sells a donkey sanctuary to a seventy-five year old woman, - with dementia? - A criminal one. Dad, we should talk about selling that too. You know um, I'm gonna take the dog for a walk alone. Do you have your phone on you? You know, I can still walk. Freeze thaw, huh? The subsurface may have some limestone. That's what's causing all the cavings. You know these roads were only meant to last about twenty years. Yah. I'll keep that in mind. Molly. Molly. Molly. What the hell's he doing now? Angus. Angus, please. Some of us gotta work tomorrow. Yes, one minute. Thank you. - Dad, are you ok? - Yeah. Do you need your spray? Okay, okay, deep breaths, daddy. Deep breaths. I got you, daddy. Well, I look forward to hearing from you. - Thank you. - Bye. You're lovely. Dinner time, Joe. Listen, your father, he can stay here if he wants but remember how sick you got with your mother. You never slept, you were always anxious, you gave up on your teacher's degree, your father couldn't cope. You were left doing it all. I'm not having you go through that again. You mean, you don't want to go through that again. Don't you dare try to shove my father into a home. I'm not trying to shove him in a home, he's said he didn't want to be a burden. He's not there yet, not even close. And when the time comes, it will be my decision. Not yours! Dad. Dad. Dad. He wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, dad. More complicated than that Barn. He can always come back home. Crappy stuff. - You must be Angus. - Yes. Thank you for getting us in so fast. Oh you're welcome. So, here are the forms to fill out. But, we'll see how we do. I think he just wants to have a trial. As you can hear, new fire doors are being installed. We're working on the teething problems. Lunch- lunch is at noon, dinner at six. Doesn't get hungry until eight. Well, he will here. This is a lovely room. Now, I am always in my office. So you can come and talk to me, anytime. Now, feel free to join in for pat the dog and songs. He doesn't sing. Right, okay. There's your bell. You can ring any time. And we will be right there, right away. Okay Dad. Here's your phone, okay? I'm going to call you later. Have a good dinner. C'mon Barns. You shouldn't be here. Some questions to ask the short listed contestants. 'Why do you want to go to space?' Original question. I didn't write them. Hydrogen line is still leaking. We may have to push the launch. They'll fix it. Nearly three hundred thousand submissions. Twelve names. One ticket. Take off has to be a great show. And finally, submissions for the Ventura space competition close at midnight with already thousands of applicants. Twelve of those names will be drawn from the lottery hat, so could one of them be you? Nut cases. Breakfast. Um, I'm not- I don't- Yeah, yeah, you will. These eggs are rubbery. I can leave this joint anytime I want. Don't forget ladies and gentlemen the hairdresser will be in today from 10 til 4. ♪ I ain't got nobody ♪ And nobody cares for me She's a little flat don't you think? ♪ I ain't got nobody ♪ And nobody cares for- ♪ Nobody cares for- ♪ Nobody cares for me ♪ Snowflake is nine, aint that devine ♪ Won't you be mine ♪ Thank you. And I'll see some of you next week. Do you want to dance? It does get better you know. Right then Len, Angus. - Time to come in. - Did you see the thing? - in the pitch black, guest residents inside now. - I'll take care of him. - I've got to close up. Angus. - Night. - Night. I know, I know. Do you suffer from diabetes? Anxiety? Heart condition? No. P-E-R-F-E-C-T. Photo. Photo, photo, photo. Good. 'Reasons why I should be chosen.' Ready to submit. What? I don't understand. Angus! Sorry we're late dad, I tried calling you. They made me stay back for more stupid math. Yeah, well, you'll thank me when you're older. Yeah, when I'm like dead older. Pardon me, Liz would like a word. Okay. Angus, are you settling in nicely? Oh, uh, I really don't think I'm going to be here for very long. Nonsense. - You are very robust. - Dad, I'll be right back. Barney. What? What, you're not even going to guess? Guess what? Well you said I could look 65. No no no, no no no, You entered the competition? Yup! Oh my gosh, yes yes yes! Does he know? His name is Len. Why doesn't he talk? Because nobody listens. As his needs increase we will move him from plan D to plan B. He's not really right for plan C. And then later we move him up to Plan A. But he um- he may want to come back home. It's always a shock isn't it? Accepting the fact that this may be your loved one's last home. So how about we continue with eighteen hundred a week see how it goes? Yes? Twelve names have been chosen for the Ventura Space Trip Competition lottery. The short listed contestants will take part in a live TV interview. Where you, the public, vote for your- Number three down is... Eleven letters, and it's 'A fluke.' I want to watch the news. News? That's not the News. It's the same old crap. Around and around it goes. And the final three lottery winner names for the space trip competition are- Give it back. Ah, wildlife. Hey, turn it back. Conor Cranston. Adrian Ciminitti. Angus Stewart. So those are our lucky short listers. Which one will you be voting for as they present themselves on the live TV interview? The winner will join Marcus Brown and six other paying passengers, some who have paid- Serendipity. That's the answer. Barney! Barney's school fees... Retirement home bills... and I don't know something for you. Barney! You should've woken me up. Since when did you become an early riser? You know I saw on the news um Some guy named Angus Stewart entered that space competition. His name came up in the lottery. Kinda weird, same name. Speaking of which, I thought I'll take Angus' telescope to him after work today, give him something to do there. Yeah, he'd like that. I'll come. I have to go to Dad's house. The realtor says that they're going to have a showing. I'll pick up some boxes. Dad? Can I skip math. - No, you can't. - What time do you finish? - Two. - Four. Four it is. Take your bar. I forgot a file. Take your bar. Go away! You won the space trip. I didn't win anything yet. Go away! You have! What's everybody doing? The sun is out, Angus. Why don't you get some fresh air? Lucky bastard. What? You really think I could, huh? You can do it. I knew you could speak. Hello? Hello Mrs Williams? And then we did more boring equations, then percentages, then pi... Yeah, well you need math Barn. I'm going to be an astronaut, so I don't. That's all math and science. Angus didn't like math. And he's going to be an astronaut. Woah woah woah, what? Barn... Nothing. Nothing, huh? Dad, dad, dad. Don't tell him I said anything. It's supposed to be a secret. Hey Barns, don't worry about it, I'm not going to make any mention it. Just take the box up to Angus's room and get us some coffee, alright? Angus, you entered the space competition? Where's Molly? Showing your house to the realtor's clients. How did you think that you were going to get away with this? You're eighty years old. - Seventy five. - And you're here. Well, shouldn't you be where you're suppose to be? Doing some of your, what is it? Deals? Listen to me, I worked my ass off from office boy up. Who's paying for all of this? Angus. I didn't mean to tell him. Oh it's okay, everybody knows. But they picked you. You're going to win the competition. You're going to be an Astronaut! Angus, you're going to have to tell them the truth. We need to get you ready. Meet me in that sunroom place. - We need to pick an outfit. - Angus. Angus! Excuse me? - What about this? - No no no, Not the yellow. Who is everybody? Can I come? What? We need to do something with your face. What's wrong with my face? You're too pale. Everything alright in here? Alright. Look Barney, you gotta understand this is a long shot, your grandfather is frail. Tomorrow, we rehearse. The lift off alone may kill you. This is ridiculous, they want young, healthy, thick. - Astronaut! - Don't call him that. Kind of, yes, in a way. It was completely conned. She saw this ad in the newspaper, somehow she just bought the donkey herd, the land, the whole thing. Thousands of dollars, put the whole thing on a credit card so I didn't even know it was happening until it was too late. I just told Len about your mother and the donkey herd. So I brought some things over and I'll finish the garage next week. It's a nice family, dad. Dad, the realtor thinks we could sell the donkeys for a good- ANGUS: No. Sold the house. And that is that. You've never even visited them. You know, I think I'm going to and lie down and take a nap. We just sold his home. Ready? Dad, ask him some questions so he can practice. I am not getting involved in this, Barney. Angus, what did you like about your job? I like to fix things. What things did you fix? Um, well things that you don't really think about. Like roads and runways. One time, there was this runway. That was built on a bed of oolitic limestone. And water eroded a hole in the limestone and that can happen when ground water freezes. Then the pipe underneath the runway, burst and the limestone dissolved this process is called Freeze thaw shattering... Agnus, it's not relevant. - Dad it's interesting. - It's not relevant. It is relevant. A sinkhole in a runway? Kaboom. You got to have the right road. Angus. Why do you want to win this? Yeah Angus, why do you want to win this trip? I've always wanted to go. I mean, always. I mean, since I was younger than you. Just imagine, Barney, you go up into space, and you turn around and there's earth Floating. Nothing's holding it up. And it's so magnificent and beautiful like a gorgeous marble. How many people have that opportunity? and why am I doing it now? Because I ain't gonna get another opportunity and I'd be a damn fool to let one this pass. You're ready. Let's have some music. I'll do it. Angus. You need to make a wish on the comet. - head to head to win the one free ticket to space. Never give up on your dreams is what I say, so here's a song to dance to for those lucky short listers. ♪ I get tongue tied ♪ just looking in your eyes ♪ and I go speechless ♪ when you say you want a little kiss ♪ and I am struck dumb ♪ when you say you wanna give me some ♪ It's just like three words can do for you ♪ Mhmm ♪ Now there are things that I'd like to say ♪ to you baby but I won't ♪ words get caught up in my throat ♪ when I see that body dancing across the floor ♪ Lordy Shorty can't express ♪ What that booty and that woah ♪ Doing to me ♪ Got to have it Astronaut. Angus, I get it. One last hurrah. But we can send you on a cruise. Nice, warm. Does Molly already know you lost your job? How did you know? A lot of good men lost their jobs. What happened? What did you do? It's complicated. You have to get yourself a lawyer. You know if I win, I'm going to be drowning- You're not going to win, you're more likely to get yourself- - Molly will kill me. - Hey, hey, hey we're not talking about me, we're talking about you. Number one, I can help you. And most important, don't tell Molly anything, not yet. Night, Barn. Hey, cmon. Dad. If Angus wins tomorrow, I know someone at school who can do fake IDs. Fake IDs? Where the hell am I sending you to school? Just a drivers license. Help him dad. Please. Marcus, this has been your dream for 25 years. Why is this journey so important to you? Listen, Imagine. Soaring first through the atmosphere, the upper atmosphere. Then when we get through everything's quiet, everything's still and you're looking down back at earth and you begin to see where we are in the universe And you begin to see where we are in relation to the universe. You see everything that's possible for us in the future. Kinda takes your breath away doesn't it? Angus, cmon, let's go! Contestants, enter. Listen, I am nervous, I am not comfortable with this. Let's just forget this, okay? You're too shiny. - Close your eyes. - Ok, not too hard because it goes into the lines. Alright, Angus. Birthdate? - August 20th 1953. - No, 54. - Cmon keep still. - Okay, I'll remember that. If I win they're gonna want proof. We've got that covered, cmon, head up. Alright, now remember don't blab. Just keep it simple, straight to the point. I know, I know how to do it. I've done press conferences. Yeah, that was like a hundred years ago. - Are you finished? - Yeah, yeah. - You ready? - Yeah. Okay, let's go. August 1953... uh, 54. Let's go Angus! Yeah Uggggg... Dad! - Dad, he's okay. - Let's not do this. No, no, I can do it. Dad, he's okay. - Okay Barney, relax. - He's got to try. Sir, can you stay with the group please. Sir. Excuse me, sir. Sir, can you please make your way to the building. Immediately. - Sir. - Yeah. - Now. - Yeah, sure. - Sorry. - No worries. Angus. So your blood pressure is a bit low. Do you faint? No, never. You on any medication? No. And you had an operation recently. Well, four years ago on my back. Well, if you lose a few pounds, could help. That's what everybody says. Astro. The last refueling test, the pressure valve kept blowing the booster LH2 tank. Construction guys say the water table is higher than we expected. If water is leaking into the inspection tunnel it will form ice and damage the vacuum seal... Can you refuel the spaceship? Look, if we sent the robot in to inspect the pipes... It's the only way to be sure. Okay, I'll get back to you. Ready for the big test? They should be so lucky to have us, eh? I mean, I've seen the others and they're pretty old so I don't see how I'm not going to win. Good luck man. Contestant slate. Three, two, one. My name is Angus Stewart. Is that okay? It won't be long now. Are you going up? - Yes. - Wow. You must be excited to get onto the short list. Oh, I never thought I'd have an opportunity like this. Listen, um, is the old runway the same runway that they used for the old airfield? Yeah, yeah it is. I mean, they've extended it of course. And they're still fuelling from inside the hanger? Oh, no, outside. Where are they laying the hydrogen lines? To the space plane? Oh, under the runway. What did they do with the subsurface to the runway? They covered it up I presume. Angus, these things can be very nerve wracking. No, no, no, no, I'm not stressed. I've done a hundred press conferences. I just wanted to shake the hand of our most mature contestant. May I ask, does your spacecraft weigh 1600 tons? It weighs exactly that. And is that exact, exact? It is precisely exact, yes. - That's a lot of weight. - Indeed it is. How does that work underground? Hmm? How much limestone is there left under the runway? You can rest assure that it's mostly sandstone under- We have the top engineers working on the project. And our winner will be in safe hands. Don't you worry. Provided that they check with the stress loading on the runway. With the all-up configuration. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. At least it's good to know. We'll pass your concerns along to our people. Thanks again. Good luck, Angus. Have we fixed the hydrogen line? We're almost there. You know what, I like him, Angus Stewart. He looks a hundred. He could be a favourite. Let's hope not. Did it start yet? Is he doing okay? Let's go Angus. If I was chosen? I'd start a scholarship fund. Yeah. For the underprivileged. Because not everybody gets a chance to achieve their dreams. And that's what this trip is all about that. A once in a life chance to dream big. Well done. Thank you. Angus Stewart, you're next. Over to you. Yeah. So, our last contestant is Angus Stewart. Hello Angus. Angus, you are our oldest contestant. You may be the first civilian grandpa in space. How does it feel to be in with a chance for the trip of a lifetime. Um. Providing that the 'experts' have done their job properly, and the geologists have checked out this area properly. And uh- providing that the um- He's too tense! He looks a little drunk. - runway itself has sufficiently reinforced... - Yes. - So that there's not a great deal of um- Ero-ero-eroding. Right, yes, so, Angus. You were a civil engineer, clearly you knew a lot of stuff. Tell us why you should be chosen? Why do you want to go? There are hundreds of thousands of people out there right now wishing they were sitting where you are. So, why should the public vote for you? What makes you that special? Um. I always wanted to be an astronaut. - Yes, and? - I... Um... Damn, he's excited, I think he froze up. No, no, no. C'mon Angus, say something. What should I do? - Oh no. - Is he okay? Is he okay? God, I knew this was a bad idea. At least he's shut up. Get him out of there. Was it a TIA? Yes, it was. And he's going to need a lot of rest. I can't believe you put him into that competition. He wanted to go. How did he even get picked? His name came up. We fudged his birth date. - You lied? - It wasn't Dad's fault. I was trying to help him. How could they even consider a frail man like that? The comet would have made him all better! - It can fix things. - Barney. It's just a frozen rock made of ice and dust. It can't fix anything. Dad? - I have to go back. - Dad, no. - Dad, it's over. - It's not safe! That's right, it's not safe. No, no, no, Molly you don't understand. No, I do understand. You had a dream to go up and now it's over. The runway is not- MOLLY: You're too old. Alright, folks, I'd like to ask you all to leave. Angus, let's get you back in bed. There we go, cmon, let's have a lie down here. Your dad has to relax. Cmon, goodnight everyone. I don't want to go, I want to stay with him. No you're going home. Why didn't you tell me? Robert told me to execute a dodgy trade. Everybody in banking bends the rules. I don't care about everybody. I screwed up, Mol. May 2nd 1972. Mr. Stewart. Thank you for your application to be a mission specialist on the space shuttle. Unfortunately you have not been selected in your bid to become an astronaut on this occasion. Hey Angus, I wanted to come and see you. Tell you in person. It was a medical concern. You know when I was young, I wanted to marry, have four children, live in a castle. Oh, and of course, I wanted to go to space. That was the last wish on my list. I suppose one out of four ain't bad. You have a lovely family, Angus. Anyway, the vote's in, they chose the boy. I know, I figured. Okay. And Angus, it's best to not say anything to the press. Leave it up to us. Len. One, two, three. Okay. It's okay. What do you want? What? You- You go. I'm taking you home. Sit down. You know, your mother wanted to go to space too. You remember that? I was a shared thing. One day, I decided to remind her of the day we first met. And I just hoped that it was a day that she would remember who I was. And she did, and she smiled. I didn't call you on the day she died. Because I was too busy losing her. A life well lived, is long enough. Was yours well lived daddy? I got you, didn't I? Okay. Hey. He wouldn't leave. He looked so happy when he went into that space interview. I mean I was worried sick but He looked so happy. Well, you know, take-off probably would have killed him anyway. Yeah. Ground water freezes, then the pipe underneath the runway, burst. And the limestone dissolved. What you doing? You know, Angus knew everything about rocks, soil composition you name it he knew it. My mother always said, he was a brilliant man. He still is. Still is. So the big day is almost here. Not a good time for the head engineer of the Ventura to quit unexpectedly. Elisa Adamison, head of communications and one of the passengers explains. Everything is absolutely on target and going ahead as planned. I am so excited to be a passenger and to be apart of this wonderful opportunity to travel into space, on the first tour- Are you in my old house yet? I'm in! What am I looking for? There's books. The paper that you're looking for should have a title, like, "The Erosion of Oolitic Limestone in reference to civil engineering." - I can't see any. - All right um- Just look for the maps. Maps, map, um. Ooh, maps, there's a lot of maps. Is there anything in there that says Solid drift map for the Springfield area. Alaska, Northwest Territories. Barney, think, Springfield. Oh, I think I found it. Can you see the old airfield where the new space center is? - Yes! - With all those curving squiggly lines? Are there any near the space station? Yeah, there a ton. Alright there's an index at the side of the map. Look down the list, it's going to tell you everything that's there. Oh, it says... Two separate oolite beds have been identified in the study area. There's oolite! There's definitely oolite. Okay, we got to tell them. Hello? Was just looking for Oolite. Ha! Exhibit A. Erosion in Oolitic Limestone with reference to Civil Engineering. Thank you very much. Then the pipe underneath the runway, burst. And the limestone dissolved. It's live. Are you going to see the donkeys? Uh, you wanna come? I can't. Then the pipe underneath the runway, burst. And the limestone dissolved. First of all, the hydrogen refueling line has been fixed. and if there is Oolite it is so far down it doesn't matter. Anyway the line is running through layer of sandstone. We did a comprehensive ground survey. My granddad thinks something is wrong with the Ventura runway. And I believe him. And everybody else should too. The last thing we need is some old man sowing doubt three days before lift off. No one's going to listen to him. What if he's right? Angus? So, what did the firm's lawyer say? What happens next? Basically, I get two meetings with the lawyer and then I'm on my own. I don't have a hope, they're going to bury me. Hello? Oh my God. I'm on my way. - It's dad. - What's going on? Can we hurry please? Angus! Where did you get that? A friend. I am so sorry. We were hoping to find him before you arrived, he could not have gone far. You lost him? Not lost, misplaced. What the hell kind of a place is this? A pretty crappy one. Angus did cause some chaos with the residents. Yes, but what he actually did do... And he lied his way through a national competition. He's gone to tell them. Tell who what? Marcus, the runway, oolite. Enough with the oolite! - Oh my God. - Angus knows! The Ventura is in trouble, we need to help him. Barney! Angus! Angus! There he is. There he is, there he is. Angus, stop! Dad, stop, get in. I'm going with you. We just have to stop them. Okay, stop this, okay? Just stop! What if you're wrong? This is a massive company. They would have done survey after survey, test after test. This used to be a runway for Christ sake! Do you have any idea how many roads I've built? I'm telling you this is not right. Dad, are you absolutely sure that there is oolite in the region? That there is oolite under the runway? You're gonna have to give me more than just a hunch. Give me one example of such an implausible scenario. Tell them about the Titanic. It hit an iceberg. It was an unsinkable ship and it sunk. The Challenger? That was a freak accident. No it wasn't, the O Rings. They knew before they went up that there was a problem. Dad, if Angus thinks something is wrong it is! Okay, everybody shut up! Shut up! Right now, what we need to do is go and tell them that Angus knows that something, alright? Get in the car! Now! Good luck dad, cmon, let's go. He's come to visit. Has he? Does he have a pass? There it is. I recognize you. You're the one who's posted that video? About the runway, right? I posted it. It was interesting. No visitors after hours. Hey, listen. I worked at a bank. At the millennium we had to call in all the old guys out of retirement just in case there was a bug that we didn't know how to fix. That's true, he was there for weeks. Oh yeah, I remember that, In case the computers crashed, or something right? Yeah. I can't let you in. Excuse me. This is oolite. It's a very light weight mineral It's found all over this area. Now the space plane, weighs hundreds of tons And I don't think the runway is stable enough to take it. My dad knows everything about roads. And runways. Do you remember the O rings? The Titanic? Yes, it hit an iceberg. The unsinkable ship sunk. Now imagine if you could help this man potentially avert a potential catastrophe. If you could help him stop it, and you didn't. People could die. Okay. You, only you. Thank you very much. - In you go. - Good luck dad! Go get 'em Angus. Bye Dad, we're right here. Excuse me. Excuse me, could you tell me- Excuse me, I'm looking- Could you tell me where Marcus Brown's office is? - Are you suppose to be here? - Uh... - Sir? - I'll be right with you. I'm looking for Mr. Brown's office, Macus Brown. - Sir. - You know, oh jeez. - Oh dear god. - Angus. There is oolite underneath the runway. The hydrogen line has leaked and it is not safe. And you are the expert who found the flaw that nobody else did. That's exactly who I am. We have several hundred engineers who have been working on this site. 'Safety is our first priority, ' right? Angus, this base revitalized this community. These things matter to Marcus. I know that you have acquired this site because the runway is basically prepped and in situ. And I know you cut corners because you needed to be the first commercial space craft, no matter what. It takes one small thing, and you know this that is overlooked in the rush to success, that one small thing will cause a disaster. Oh dear God. The vacuum pipe surrounding the spaceship's hydrogen line has not been sealed properly. We fixed it. The hydrogen leaked and it froze the surrounding ground water. What happened to the porous limestone underneath? We re-enforced the runway. But did you account for the all up configuration? The weight of the ship and the passengers? and if you're off by even one kilogram the ice can press on the limestone underneath. Enlarge the cracks. Resulting... In a hole so big that will swallow the entire spacecraft and all the passengers in it! Okay, listen, if there is a problem. And it is as you say it is? - How do you suggest we fix it? - Oh come on. He's been retired for twenty years. We can't go listening to everybody - who has an opinion. - Bill- Listen to me. If you move the hydrogen lines to the other end of the runway. Where the assembly area is that may work. and then all you have to do is re-lay the runway. Yeah, that's all. Do you have any idea how much that's going to cost? Yeah, well then just take the chance and create the sinkhole and let the Ventura project sink with it. My father said that this mission couldn't work.
