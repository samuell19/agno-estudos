? Adaptarea: Legendofmir Traducerea: DOOMNEZEU ? Centuries ago, prince Asura was born into this world. His father, the king, trained him to be strong ruler. But he grew up to be a greedy arrogant man. Who lusted for power to rule the world. So he learnt dark magic from evil sorcerers. And obsorbed dark energy from human souls, becoming so powerful that he turned into the evil, Asura Moga. But then came a handsome, and mightly knight named, Tomra. Tomra and his friend Bentour had forged a sword named Zang, but while facing the powerful Asura Moga Tomra was overwhelmed, and was going to be defeated, until he suddenly left forward at Asura and struck the magic sword Zang into Asura Moga's head. The magical powers of good, and evil, created a huge explosion. Asura was turned to a stone, and Zang broke into 6 pieces. After the battle Tomra was nowhere to be found. In their anguish the villagers built a temple around Asura, to keep people from seeing the true evil of Asura Moga. Thunderfest is so cool. I wish I could be just like him. Dr. Xombie, why do you come to kidnap our people? I am Bayu and I will stop you. Bayu, the thunderfest. I have heard your powers are all fake. So I am kidnapping this pretty girl. Bayu, please don't let him hurt me. Sonia, don't be afraid. Thunderfest will help you. Yep, that's it! I am going to be so super. My gosh! Look at this village. It's so unfair, mom made me spend my vacation here. They probably don't even have running water. I wonder if uncle is home. Hello! Excuse me! Anybody at home? - Someone's at the door. - I wonder who? Hello! This place is historic. They don't have a door bell, or do they use this thing? - Sister, don't touch that thing. - I am sorry. I thought maybe this might be my uncle Freudo's house. You should knock on the door first, before asking me any questions. - One might think you are rude. - Well, okay. Tough guy. Is there anybody at home except you? - My father is working in the fields. - Yeah! Who are you again? Well, if you weren't so rude, I would tell you. Look there he is. Dad, some strange girl is asking for you. - There. - Rainie you made it out here. Yes, uncle. My mom just left a few minutes ago. Don't worry. Perhaps this is not cool like in the city but it will be fun. It's good for people to understand where they are from. Especially in this season the air is so refreshening. - For real dad. Who is she? - I forgot to tell you. This is your cousin from the city. Introduce yourself. You are my cousin! Why didn't you tell me? I am Bayu. I am Rainie, and you are a peculiar kid. Help! Somebody help me! - Somebody is screaming. - Help! - Help! - I heard it too. Let's go find out if we can help. Demons! Demons! Forest demons! The forest demons! They are real, and I saw them. Calm down! What are you talking about there? You don't understand. It's true, the demons are real. Look at my head. I was hit from behind. Do you see this bump? - I am not lying. - Yeah, just calm down. Bayu. Do you know what that crazy guy is talking about? I think he is referring to the demons, in the village legend. My father has always warned me to stay away, from the Northern part of the forest. They say that monsters rule the forest, and they attack whoever gets lost deep in the woods. I was just looking for some firewood. You know we shouldn't go into that part of the forest. Yeah and the best part is, none of the victims saw their attacker face to face. The demons knock them out, and drag their bodies from the forest. I don't believe in ghosts. They probably just tripped over, or attacked by wild deer. I bet you never went out there, and checked it out. Of course, not! Because my dad said to stay away. Bayu is scared of his own shadow. He is just blaming his father because he is a baby. It's simple, he is a coward. Right Bayu? Yeah! A chicken. Little baldies! I am not a chicken. Well, I could go if I wanted to. Prove it. Why don't you go to the forbidden forest? Yeah! we'll find out who can stay in the forest until dark... Little baby. And who'll be the first one to run away. All right, I will prove that I am not a chicken. Wait a second. Bayu, you don't have to do, what they say. Your dad will be totally pissed if something bad happens to you. Yeah! You better listen to that bossy girl. It will save your major embarassment when the village sees you running home peeing your pants. Don't worry, they always bully me. This is the perfect time for me to prove myself. Okay, it's a deal, yo! This will be good. We will be waiting after lunch at the edge of the forest. You better be there, or else.... - Let's go. - Okay, boss. - Let's go. We got to get ready. - What? We! Why we? Wait! Bayu. I didn't say I am coming with you. Roasted chicken. Yes, I am starving. I am hungry too. Help yourself Rainie. Come on, the chicken is delicious. Don't be shy. Dig in. Look at Bayu. He is like a garbage disposal. He eats like a champ. Look at him. Uncle! I think he is choking. I burped. He always does that. He needs to slow down. Come on eat. Not too much, thank you. Have you walked around the village yet? No, but I am planning to go sometime later. That's good. I love nature. It's beautiful. I hope you are going to appreciate this place. Bayu's mother always did. Yep, now I am ready. I bet Bayu is going to freak out when he sees us dressed up. You are the best, Draco. I bet he is going to die of a major heart attack. He is coming. Put on your mask and get ready. Are you sure about this, Bayu? It's board daylight, no ghosts are going to show up today. Maybe the ghost, is still in bed. Don't you boys have anything else to do this afternoon? Where are the baldies? What was that? No, it can't be. You hurt Draco. He is going to get you. There are still more of them. Bayu! - Yes. - No, where did he go? Those stupid boys from the village. I don't want to play this game anymore. - No. - Boss! Boss! Wait for us. They are running away. Thunderfest! Bayu, don't chase them. Get back here, you cowards. - Don't run. - Wait for me. Bayu! Where are you? Bayu! My Gosh! I am going to get lost. What was I thinking! I shouldn't have got involved in this stupid game. If he is lost, what do I tell uncle? Bayu! - Rainie! Rainie, I am here. - Bayu! Come here. - There you are. - I found something. Don't move Bayu, I am coming. I finally found you. Why did you do that? Let's go home, or your father will be mad at us. What the heck? Look at that. Look at what? - Come on, let's look around. - Bayu! Come back here. Wait for me. Awesome. I am the greatest super hero in the whole world. Bayu! Rainie. Rainie! Look, what I have become? Look! - Who are you? - It's me silly, I am Bayu. Bayu! That's right. Look at my body. I look awesome. You didn't think I had it in me, did you? I took out the sword out of a giant statue inside there. - Suddenly, I sword shined so bright. - I must be dreaming. My body felt hot, and then I morphed into this tiger knight. This sword gave me super powers. I am going to go, and test it right now. Did you see what I did? Am I awesome, or what? Bayu! My power. How did I lose it? Right! Transform! Transform me again! Why can't I transform? Bayu. Is that, is that the sword you talked about? Yeah! It's not just any sword. I read it in a book. It's called Zang. It has magical powers. I never believed any of those myths until this moment. This is awesome. But Bayu, it is said that Zang is dangerous in the wrong hands. Trust me Bayu. You don't want to mess with this. You don't want to be responsible if the dark forces get it. The sword can be used for evil. And we can't take that chance. After seeing what it did to you, I believe this sword can be dangerous. I think we should go and put it back where you found it. - What? No way! Never. No! - But we don't know what it can do. - And it doesn't belong to you. - No, it's mine. My pendant glowed and got attached to it. - See. - Your pendant! - See. It's from my mother. - Your mother? And it fits here perfectly. I feel like it's meant for me. And with its magic, I can be so super. I don't believe it. - So you really want to keep it? - Of course! I feel like I am meant to. I can protect the people of the village. And everyone will call me Bayu, the super hero. The sword of Zang! Bayu! No! Dad! My warriors! Go get them. Bayu, are you all right? My dad! I need to go home to my dad. No. Those nasty things are still looking for us. - What about my dad? - Listen to me, Bayu. It's just the two of us against them. The best way we can help the village is to warn them. - The village? - Yes. All right. Look over there. Let's go. Let's go. No! My Gosh! Let's go. Come on, let's go. No! First my dad, and now everybody else. - Did I do all this? - All because of this sword. It's all my fault. Kiddo! Stop crying. It has been centuries, and finally the time has come. Is that a talking monkey? Who are you? Call me Empu. Bayu, you can still save your father, and the village. What? I can? Really? How can I do that? With this? What do you mean? This sword you pulled from the statue, had imprisoned Asura for centuries. Asura is the evil giant you saw. If you want to save your father, you can defeat Asura by collecting all 6 pieces of the Zang. Relic pieces, but how? That monster is way too big, and scary. It is your destiny. There is no turning back for you now. You have to save the village, and your father. Poor, my dad. All right. Good. Now we all must get some rest. We will leave first thing in the morning. Bayu, don't worry. I am going to go, with you. You will? Yeah, I have promised your dad that I'd always protect you. And I always keep my promises. We will work this thing out together. And I promise, I will save my father. It's morning already. But the forest is still so dark. I wonder why? My dad said we won't find any more villages, beyond the Northern edge of the forest. True story. No more villages. But I only brought a little food. What if we don't find any people out there? - What should we do? - We can catch some chickens. And grill chicken. Can we eat now? All this talk about food is making me, hungry. No. You can't eat that much either right now. - Come on. - Empu said we have a long way to go. Empu, where are we headed anyway? Do you know where the relic pieces are, for the rest of the sword? Long ago, the sword was forged by my friend. Bentour, and I in a special place the Varna world. Bentour left a clue that can help us find the relic pieces. I am really glad that your friend made this sword. Indeed! If we hadn't, Asura may have perfected his power. Because back then, the unstoppable Asura forced us to use our only hope. It was the last resort. The 6 most powerful knights in the land assembled together and merged their powers in a magical weapon. And that's how the sword of Zang was created. Each relic piece holds a different power from every knight. Knights? Yes, that's why your sword is called the knight Zang. Made from 6 knights of Varna, a 1000 years ago. At that time, nobody then could fight Asura, except the knights. Varna, the underworld. Is that where you are from? Correct. Empu, we are not on the way to that world, right? Don't we have to go through a portal or something. I mean, can we come back. Actually, we are now in between Varna and the human world. I still don't get it. Now all the humans, if they have arise, of the kingdom of Ranca. There you are. Nowarah, the traitor. Look, what happened to you without me. Even sitting on my throne can only happen in your dreams. Unfortunately, I must depend on you to find my enemies. Nowarah! Nowarah, king of the wicked, general of my Ranca army. Arise from your long sleep. I have returned. Asura! Is it really you, my king, Asura? You live again. Did your long sleep erase your memory? Forgive me, lord. I am just surprised. How long does it take for those knights to reincarnate as a human? Knights? Reincarnate? It takes a 1000 human years, my lord. So how are you feeling today, mighty Asura? Stop acting nice. You know that if you have got that chance you would stab me in my back. No, you misunderstand my lord. I simply resided over your kingdom while you were away. Because I knew one day you would return. Be quiet. A 1000 years has been wasted. This time I will make sure my plan works. - Hey, Nowarah. - Yes, my lord. I was released by a little boy who pulled out the sword of Zang. I feel I know him. Find him and bring me the sword. I will, my lord. Consider it done. Come. Yeah! This is amazing. Empu, it's been a 1000 years, is your friend Bentour still alive. He was lost in the battle of Asura. It changed all of us. Are you sure he left the clues like you said? Yes and he kept everything related to his creation. The clues are the only thing that can help us retrieving the relic pieces of the sword. It's not far from here. But it's time, we should proceed. Bayu, come on, let's go. Okay. We've been followed. What is that? It's him! He is here. He is back. Hello, boy. A little boy like you shouldn't be wandering around carrying a dangerous weapon like that. Give it to me and I promise I won't hurt you. Stop! Who are you? Stop right there. I am powerful, you know? Such a brave young man. It suits you. You know? I remember you from many years ago. But sadly there is no time to play. So give it to me. Tauntra! From a great knight to a monkey. What a demotion. Bayu, it's time. Transform! Transform! But how? I don't remember. Rainie! Okay boy, now give me the sword. I have waited a 1000 years for this. Bayu concentrate now. Focus on the call of the Zang. The call! Remember the first time you heard the Zang call you. Yes, the voice I heard. Yeah! I did it. Now I know how to transform. Attack! Get off me! Even with all that power you are still just a boy inside. Bayu! It's time to use the sword of Zang, Bayu. - Yeah! - I won't let you use it. Now, your time is up. I don't think Asura gave me all my powers when he woke me up. I shall remedy that. Not bad, boy. Unfortunately, today's games are over. But don't worry, I will be back to play again later. I am not scare to you. Come back here. I am going to give you a big down. You will have your chance, boy. Mark my words. Come back here you big chicken. Get down here. I am not finished with you. Empu! - Rainie! - Bayu! Are you okay? Yeah! I am okay. But Empu... I am all right. Nowarah is one of Asura's generals. We are lucky. It wasn't Asura himself. He is still calculating the power of you and your sword. It won't be long now. Before his minions try to attack us again. We mustn't let our guard down. Nowarah, you dare come back empty-handed to me. Have you forgotten the face of my devils who failed me? Or shall I refresh your memory? Forgive me, my lord. I almost got the Zang. But the boy who hold it is bend to reincarnated. And with the help of the sword he can transform. Perhaps, if I had all of my power, I could fight him. Are you saying that I am weaker than the boy? No, of course not, my lord. But you haven't fully gained your power. However, there is a way that we can defeat him. Sweetheart, what are you talking? Tell me. You see my lord the sword is incomplete with its relic pieces scattered. They are trying to collect the pieces. If you give me another chance I will collect the pieces before they do. And if you absorb the power of those pieces taking that sword will be like taking a candy from a baby. All right, deliver each of the pieces to me once you retrieve them. But this time don't waste the power I gave you. You are so wise, my lord. So, Bentour has returned. He won't be able to stop me again. Cool! Is this the place? Yes, paranastrocara. The time has gone by so fast. What happened to you that day? My dear, dear friend Bentour! Cool! So what are we looking for? We are looking for an ancient scroll with the location map of all 6 knights. What is this thing? This is awesome. Let's start looking over here. That's a lot of scrolls. Most of these scrolls are drawings of weapon designs. Some are Bentour's journals of what he learnt throughout his life. And yet there is only one map that can help our quest. Bayu, come give me a hand. Okay. Is this also a scroll? There is something inside this too. Is this the one? Empu do you know exactly what we are working for? Everything I have seen has these weird drawings on them. The scroll will have a round seal stamp of a tiger's head. Just like that one. What is this smell? I think it's food. Bayu. I know that smell. It's the smell of cooked fish. Where is he going? Come on. I knew it. I knew it. But whose room is this? This place is supposed to be empty. I will ask him later if he comes back. There is a lot of fish It's always good to share. I am going to have one. Who are you? Rainie! Bayu! Who are you? I am an inter kid. You are trespassing. And hey! I saw that you stole my food. I am the one asking the questions. Who are you guys? What do you mean? What do I mean? You are the one who are trespassing. - Dummies. - What? Are you calling me dumb? You come down here. I don't even believe you live here. Where are your parents? Now, let Bayu out of the cage. Yes, right. Empu said this was his friend's house. Bayu, don't eat that! That's nasty. Jeez man, you guys are just really a couple of dummies. Now I wonder what I should with this little kid. What? I am not a little kid. I am a super hero. Yeah! Wipe your snot, kid. Go ahead and just chill out. Behind you. You all must be from the city. Well. Look what I found. That's my camera. When did you steal it? Give it back. What this? Yeah! I found this yesterday. So... Where? I wonder! Over near the waterfall. So you are a stalker. That's Rainie's camera. I can't lift it. I have to transform. Transform! All right, time for pay back. As a super hero it's my duty to bring justice. Well look at his. Why don't you just try to catch me then? Get him, Bayu. Bayu, you a tiger. Use your claws to climb. Yeah! Great idea! Yes. Oh yeah! He is so fast. You guys can't even touch me. The power of that sword is useless on you. He knows about Bayu's sword. Look, you should probably just give up the sword to me, kid. It will be way more right if I am the one who fights with it. What? Did you just try to kill me? Hey, punk! I am not a kid. Bayu! I am so, mad. You are going to pay for what you did to me. This guy seems to be pretty strong. Looks like, I mean, I have to go with plan B then. This kid has some intense magic. He is getting away. Don't worry. I won't let him escape. Got you. Yeah! Well, you are quite a slippery one. Don't you know when they quit. Give me that. Now what do I do with you? Hey, Bayu. Wow. We will still need 500 souls. And after that my power will be unstoppable. And I will rule the world again. Asura has never been patient. He always underestimates the humans. The world has changed much since he became a statue. Humans are more dangerous than ever. Well, so am I. All right, who is this other boy? And you don't seem to be very surprised to see us. Now, why are you stealing from us? You are calling me a thief! And you dare hold me hostage in my own house. He seems to know about Bayu's sword. He tried to grab it from him. What? He is a thief! Is that true? My friend Bentour forged Bayu's sword in this house. If he lives here it is possible that he knows about it. I don't know why but you remind me of Bentour. Maybe he is on Asura's side. I saw him using strange magic. He is not a normal kid. Strange magic? He can move and jump so fast and I saw strange magic come out of his hands. And he may jump and fly all around the room. Perhaps he has studied the scrolls Bentour left in his house. Then he might know about the map we are looking for. Were you guys trying to look for something? Hey, I got an idea. How about you untying me? And if you are really lucky maybe I will help you find it. You think we are going to give you a chance to escape. All right. Untie him. But why? He is going to try to steal my super sword. Zang obeys one knight only. It won't work with another person. It's nothing to be worried about. So, young man, you probably won't believe me. But your tattoo belongs to the blacksmith clan. You see, the first members of the clan were Empu Bentour and then me Empu Tauntra. - What you got there? - - Only Bentour can utilize... It's nothing. All right, Bayu, untie the boy. Okay. Don't try any funny business. Hey, Rainie do you know how to untie him? Now, to clear up this misunderstanding I suggest all of you introduce yourselves. Young man, you never told us what is your name. I am Kooda, 33rd generation of Astrocara. Well Kooda, I am Bayu. The super hero. I am his cousin Rainie. We are looking for the original manuscript used to create the sword of Zang. Bayu, show it to him. This sword was once used to imprison Asura. Asura is a dark prince from a 1000 years ago, who only knows destruction. Now he is free and his ambition is still the same. In order to defeat him we have to restore this imperfect sword with the help of the map. My grandfather once told me about Asura and the great sword. And that's why I was curious when I saw that you carried it. I don't remember my grandfather telling me the story about the map. Or he didn't have a chance to tell me. Before he died he collected all sorts of ancient weapon designs that he feared would be abused by evil demons. Well maybe he thought your sword was one of them. And the map of its creation was kept along with all the others. Do you happen to know where those items are now? Grandpa hid them all in a secret chamber. Follow me, come on. Interesting! Got you. Cancorus, blow the horn. I want to make my grand entrance. Perhaps we can make this a little more interesting. We will give him a head start with their little feets. Well, what are you waiting for? What's that sound? It's the sound of... the sound of Sesha's horn. What does that mean? They only sound the horn to warn the enemy of their attack. How come he always knows where to find us? I don't think he ever even lost track of us. Follow me, hurry. Once you got the map, you got to leave this place. And here I thought humans were useless. How could they make such funny toys to play with? Bye Bye. Maybe I went away too far. I hope someone is left alive down there. I still have a show for them to watch. Come out, wherever you are boy. I have got something you need to see. There you are. Him again. Wait! I would be careful if I were you. You wouldn't want to slice your old friend. Draco! You know him, right? He is your friend from the village. Say hello to my little friend. What have you done to him? You snake. Who me? I didn't do anything to him. This is Asura's work. He suck this boy's soul dry. What the...? But now it's my turn to work. Which colour do you like? Let's see. I think green suits you best. Yes. Trigger treats. What are you doing to him? You see. Leave him alone. Well, that's the spirit boy. If Asura didn't give me enough power I could have lost my hands with that move. What happened? You care too much about others. You should only worry about you own thing, boy. Bayu, I am going to go and save that boy. Me too, Bayu. Don't get too excited. I will deal with your friends after I destroy you. I won't let you. Release him! Empu, how can I help you out? I don't think mask can be removed without magic. In order to find its weakness, we need to know about the spell. That demonic creature gets all of his power from a magical stone. But there is no stone on this boy, only the mask. I think we are too late. It is time. The show is about to begin. A new friend to our extravaganza! Kesura! This show needed some new life. But I will set up for friend's life instead. - Watch out! - Now where do you think you are going? You two go find that map. I will distract that monster. Empu, no! It looks like your friends are going to die first. Your concern for others makes you weak. What are you doing? Stay focused Bayu. I am not done yet. Rainie and the boy. He is no longer interested in me. Bayu, I am going to go after that monster. Keep your focus on him! That's right, I have to learn to trust my friends. Because I am the only one with the power to fight Nowarah. Okay. I have got this. Empu, go help Rainie. Now I know how to get to him. Compassion is your weakness. Empu! Empu! Look out! No! His attention is on me now. Do you really want to know how to save your friends? Then just give up already, after all you are only a boy. What can you possibly do? You really think you can defeat Asura? That's impossible. What should I do? - Where is the secret room? - It's over there. Hold these. A spoon, and fork. On my cue, slam your fist hard on the table. Do you understand? 1, 2, 3. What's happening? This room has the moon's gravity powered by my bracelet. Without it we would fall to the ground and the booby traps below would stab our bodies. Does this look familiar to you? The logo, it's the same as the pendant on Bayu. Come on. - That monster is still after us. - Yeah, but you can handle him, right? Are you kidding me? But I saw what you did, when you were fighting Bayu. He is just a little kid. But that crazy monster is seriously going to kill us. What about the booby traps? You have lots of them here, don't you? This room has a cage bigger than the one upstairs. - But who is going to be the bait. - What? You will be the bait. It's not my idea. Crazy. You know where the switch is, right? Get ready! Wait! How did she become the bait. Wait! How did I become the bait? Okay, great. I've got a plan that still works. You better not miss. That's not fair. Listen, I am never going to be the bait again. Let's not waste anymore time. This fight is boring me. I would like to just slice you into pieces. But if you die your sword might be of no use to me. And I can't risk that. I will make you a deal. And this is my last offer boy. Give me the sword and I won't kill you friend. I have never been this generous, with anyone before. And your time is up. Wait! - I will give it to you. - I am so sorry Empu. Don't worry about me. Who will defeat Asura if you surrender your sword? Remember your father. I almost shed a tear. But the time for talking has come to an end. What's that? That boy is alive. Impossible! Where is Kesura? What? No! - Where is he? - Run here. You back. We will take care of Empu. Don't you stand there. Get in there big guy. Fight him, or I will. You are right. He is mine. You want my sword. Come get it. Interesting. Very interesting! I am going to give it to you, with all of my super powers. Run high! Kid! What do you think of my moves? You won't be able to stop me. And your last story, boy. Come at me. It's all spinning. I'm controlled now. I don't believe it. I was defeated by a boy. A little hero. You did it, Bayu. Empu! Are you okay, little cousin? - Yeah, I am okay. - But that mask man over there... To me, he was like a human too, and I killed him. Bayu, you can't look at it like that. If you didn't destroy him there's going to be more like your friend here. Draco! What's wrong with him? - What's wrong? - He is still alive. - But is he going to be okay? - Asura took his soul. Bayu, monsters like Asura and his army, need human souls to keep their evil alive. Because they have sold their very own souls, into the darkness. Don't feel bad if you feel remorse. Your pure heart felt pity for Nowarah. However, you have discovered one of the most important qualities of a knight. - You have a heart of virtue. - I have virtue? That's correct. When you know when to chose, right over wrong then you achieve wisdom. If you master both virtue, and wisdom, then you will be ready to become a true knight and fight for justice. He is right. You will fight for justice like a true super hero. All right. From now on, that is my quest. To become a true hero knight. Good, and now behold. The map of Varna. A world forgotten by humans. But how do we find the pieces of the sword? 6 of the Canara knights got their magic power, from holy sites that are marked in this map. The relic pieces want to find a way back to their sword. We should find the first relic piece, here in the Envas cave. The Envas cave. I am in. You will need all the help you can get. I am going with you. I am a member of the Astrocara. It is my duty to help destroy Asura. Let's do it together. This is going to be awesome. ? Adaptarea: Legendofmir Traducerea: DOOMNEZEU ?
