Okay, girl, I am outta here. - Drinks? - Not tonight. I have so much stuff I have to do. Okay, don't run yourself into the ground. You should go out and date. Get out. I'll see you tomorrow. We're closed. Help! Mornin'. Can you believe it, I did another conference call Sarah scheduled today? I know, my day's already packed. Yeah, not to rain on it, but Davis just got a call from Shirley LeCroy, and it seems she's unhappy with the banister on the staircase. Wait, who's the contractor on that house? Gary Brothers. But parkside stairs versus a... Man. So I suppose they want me out there. You know what, why don't we get Liz to handle it? Um, it's-it's okay, I can... She's very familiar with the property. It's all right, I'll handle it. What is it? You know, actually, could you get Liz to handle this? Um, something just came up. Hey, you're home early. What's wrong? I got this email at work today. My God. I know we agreed that we'd leave it up to the recipient to contact us... Honestly, I never thought this day would come. But it has. I don't think I can do it. Well... then we don't have to. Okay. You don't want to? I think it would bring some closure. I just miss her so much. Look, I don't think closure means forgetting her. That's never gonna happen, I'm not gonna let that happen. But meeting the person who has her heart... A piece of her lives, giving life to someone who needs it. We should see who's been given that gift. Right? Yeah. I think Madison would want that. Yeah, I know she would. It's good that we're doin' this. - Yeah. - Don't be nervous. Whatever happens, happens, right? Hi. Are you Mr. and Mrs. Cummings? - Juley, please. - Hi. - This is Dennis. - Hey, how are you? - Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you, yeah. You must be Vera. Can we get you a coffee? Can you drink coffee? - Yes. Yeah. - Okay. Um, since it's been six months, I'm not completely out of the woods yet, but my body hasn't shown any signs of rejection, so fingers crossed. Could we get three coffees, please? And you want, milk and sugar on the side? - Sure. - Yeah, okay. So how are you feeling overall? Well, I'm feeling like myself again... thanks to you two. I know this can't be easy for you. When they told me that my donor's family might wanna meet with me, I-I couldn't pass up the opportunity. - We're really glad you're here. - Thank you. After the foundation gave me your information, I sat with it for so many days. I wasn't sure how you'd react, I-I didn't wanna bring up any painful memories. What I'm trying to say is that I know that the only reason that I'm able to sit here with you is because you had to lose someone so precious to you. But there is not a moment that goes by that I don't think about that. And I want to honor her every single day. I'm so sorry, I didn't, I didn't mean to upset you, I... I-I just wanted to let you know how-how grateful I am, how-how lucky... - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Um... This is my cell phone number. If you... I-if you wanna see me again, j-ju... Please don't hesitate to call. I, I'm so sorry, I-I didn't... I messed this up. I'm so sorry. It's all right. I swear she must have thought I was unhinged. Well, you had every right to feel the way you felt. Did you see her? I scared her so much, she couldn't get away from us fast enough. And I don't blame her. Hey, there's no manual for this. We're doing the best we can. Hey, honey, how are you? Hey, how's your day going? You know, just putting out fires as usual, every minute. What's going on? So do you think you can come home a little early tonight? I've a surprise for you. A surprise? Okay, I, I-I think I can manage that. Okay, great. See you then. Love you. Love you, too. Hey, honey, I'm so sorry I'm late. There was terrible traffic. Honey? Hello, Dennis. Hey, hon. Here we go. - Come on, join us. - Okay. My God, Juley. I-I thought I hadn't caught up gnocchi when I studied abroad in Italy, but this blows that straight out of the water. I just boiled some water and heated up the sauce, that's it. So, Vera, tell us a little more about yourself. Well, my life is an open book. I'm afraid you might not find it very interesting. Well, I mean, what do you do for a job? I'm sorry. Are you, are you able to work? Yes. Yes, I am able to work now. I had to take a short break during my recovery, but, um, I can't afford to not work anymore, so I'm looking now. W-what did you do before? Well, I graduated a couple of years ago from Breton University. - Great. - Yeah. It's a small liberal arts college about an hour up the coast. I majored in classics, so wasn't exactly easy to find a job after graduation. I can imagine. Now the guys I went to school with, the same ones who were playing video games all day and getting stoned, they got offered six-figure salaries just because they could code. But no one wanted to hire me to discuss Middlemarch. Well, you have plenty of time, believe me. I had no idea what I wanted to do when I was your age. You always talk about how you used to redecorate your doll houses when you were a kid, right? What I'm trying to say is that there's no rush, okay? What are you gonna do now? Well, when I couldn't get a big-girl job, I turned to waitressing, up until the point that I got sick. Don't worry, I know it's nothing to brag about, but I could pay the bills. I think it's incredible that you do interior design. I know it must have taken so much work to get where you are. I hope to be like you one day, Juley. Vera, that's so sweet. Thank you. That means a lot. And, you know, if-if interior design is something that you think you might wanna pursue, I mean, I could help you. No, I, I wouldn't wanna overstep. No, seriously, it would be my pleasure. Wow. I mean, I don't have words. - Thank you. - Of course. Of course. - I will talk to HR tomorrow. - Well, cheers to that. - Cheers. - Cheers. You know, I think I had a little too much tea. Do you mind if I use the restroom? Yeah. Um, up the stairs to the right. Thank you. What? "What?" What? Everything what. What the... Why is she even here? I-I didn't really think it was that big of a deal, Dennis. And, you know, I, I wanted to surprise you. Okay, look, I'm sorry that I didn't tell you, but, you know, I-I didn't really think that you would be open to it. Yeah, exactly. I felt really bad for how I reacted the other day, okay? I just wanted to have a clean slate with her. So you offered her a job at your fir... at your firm? W-what? That's not like you, Jules. Well, we barely even know her. Wow, you're being really insensitive. Hey. Keep your voice down. Do you have any idea what she's going through? She got sick, she had surgery and now she's out of a job. God, I felt really terrible for her, and she did not deserve the way we treated her the other day. All she wanted to do was say thank you and tell us how grateful she was, so... We needed to do this. Okay? What's takin' her so long? She just went upstairs. N-no. Vera? Vera? Vera, are you okay? - You're so jumpy. - W-Where did she go? I don't know. Maybe she used another bathroom. Vera? She was very beautiful. She was. Inside and out. Here, I wanna show you something. Sit. A few years ago, a bird flew into our patio door window and I thought it was a goner. I told Madison that the humane thing to do would be to call animal control and have them take care of it. But Madison wouldn't hear of it. She named the little guy Peanut. And she knew that if she took really good care of him and fed him every day and loved him, that he would heal up and fly away. And she was right. Three weeks later, little Peanut was all brand-new and off he went. She kept the box as a reminder that even broken things can heal. I'm really glad that you have her heart. She would have wanted someone good to have it. Okay. Think maybe we should go downstairs? The food's probably getting cold, right? You see her track marks? - What? - Track marks. No. Didn't see them. Well, I saw 'em. Dennis, she had a heart transplant. Do you know how many times she's been in and out of the hospital? How many procedures she's had, how many times she's had an IV inserted in her arm? Poor girl probably feels like one big pin cushion. Or maybe she needed the transplant because she's an addict. Think about it, Jules. I mean, you don't find it odd that she, she never once mentioned why she needed the transplant? She said she got sick. That's not very specific. - Maybe it's personal. - She has our daughter's heart! What-what-what's more personal than that? I don't really wanna talk about this anymore. Our daughter saved someone's life, someone who is really grateful for that. That's all I need to know. Madison... Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Why did you let me die? Hey, hey, hey, hey! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's over, it's over. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Just closed Flesner, 200K. You know what time it is, baby, it's gonna be a top-shelf night tonight. That's great. Gonna celebrate with Emily. Yeah, that reminds me. - Juley called Emily last night. - Right. Yeah, invited us over to your little shindig to celebrate your, big promotion. Yeah. Said not to bother bringing any bathing suits because we're all goin' skinny-dippin'. - Hey! - What? What? I'm sorry. Did you, did you need something? You okay, man? You don't look so good. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just... I, I just had a lot on my mind. Yeah, well, um, I get it. I-I just, I just wanted to say that I'm excited about this weekend and happy that you're having people over again. It's... healthy. Thanks. Thank you. Of course. All right, well, I'm gonna do a lap. Let these guys know. Gary? - Do two laps. - My man. - You deserve it. - Great idea. - Juley. Hi. - Hey. Hi. Thank you so much for meeting with me. I know, I know how busy you are with work. Please, as hard as I work, choosing the right type of marble isn't exactly curing cancer. I told you what you do sounds so cool. Sometimes. What's going on? Is everything okay? This is Madison's. Yes. I took it from her room. Why would you do that? Something came over me when I was in there the other night. I felt this overwhelming feeling of love and kindness. And there isn't a single day that I'm not grateful for my heart. But this was different. I feel like she is alive inside me. And being in there just connected as me and her with you... I'll have to be honest with you, Juley, I have never felt that kind of love before. It was so beautiful. And when we left, I panicked. I-I didn't wanna lose that feeling. I didn't wanna lose her, and without thinking, I just, I grabbed the locket. And I-I don't know why, I mean, I got home and it was so ridiculous I, I stole from you. So I'm returning it. I'm so sorry, I should not have done that. Here. - What? - I want you to have it. - No. - Yes. Madison would want you to have it, too. Thank you. May I? Yeah. Can I be honest with you about something? Yes. Of course you can. Remember the other night when we were talking about my recovery and I said that everything was going fine? That wasn't entirely true. I just didn't wanna say anything to upset Dennis. He doesn't seem to like me very much. No, no. Dennis is... He-he's just really busy at work. He just got a promotion, so... Okay. So, Vera, what's wrong? Um, because of all the anti-rejection medication that I'm taking, my body is more susceptible to, um, they're called opportunistic infections. I've been doing the best that I can with them, but they've been pretty debilitating. Aren't there any medications you can take? No, there are, but they're just really expensive and my insurance won't cover it because they're considered experimental treatments. And you're not working right now. Right. I did speak to HR about an entry-level position, but we-we just don't have anything right now. That's okay, um, that's... Thank you so much for asking, I mean, everything that you've already done, Juley, thank you. You know what? You should not be struggling right now. I'm gonna help you pay for those medications. - Juley, no, no, you ca... - Yes. Hey, you can pay me back when you're healthy and settled. Okay? Why do you keep saving my life? You're family now, okay? You won't even give a dollar to a homeless person, and you gave this woman who's still almost a perfect stranger $5000? It's nothing. No. It is not nothing. We have the money to spare. That is not the point. Okay, so tell me, what is the point? The point is that you went and did that for her, for her, without speaking to me. I, you know, I-I didn't realize that I needed your permission to spend my money. That is not what I'm saying, what I'm saying is... Come on, Juley, our whole lives we discuss everything together. I don't get it, I don't get it. Ever since she came into our lives, it's driving us farther and farther apart. - She needs me. - Come on, Juley. Juley, you are not thinkin' straight. Do not patronize me, especially because you're obviously having a much easier time getting over this than I am. Really? Really? She's not Madison. I'm sorry. She has Madison's heart. So whether you like it or not, we are bonded to her and she's gonna be in our lives. Honey, I'm your husband. I am your husband. I am asking just... Okay, fine. Can there please just be a little distance, boundary, something? Okay. Okay, I'll try. - Sorry. - It's okay. I've missed these little get-togethers. - To more of 'em. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Well, if I have to listen to these two talk about work, I'm gonna go inside and watch Seaspan for more excitement. Tell me about the firm. I don't really know what to tell. Come on, come on, I watch all those Herman Friedman shows. What kind of properties are you flipping? Well, I can assure you it's far less interesting than they make it look like on TV. Um, mostly, I'm just negotiating with contractors and trying to decide if we should go with marble or quartz. Well, it sounds exciting to me. Certainly more than derivatives and options. I'll tell you what's exciting. Glasco just purchased 20 acres of primo property on the southern shore of Farrington Lake. He said, in the summer he's gonna landscape it for ATV use and then in the winter, depending on the snowfall, he may bring in snowmobiles. Isn't that right, Dennis? That's what he, that's what he said... - I don't believe this. - Hi! - Sorry I'm late. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Vera. - Hi. - I'm Gary Banks. - Hi. So nice to meet you. - This is my wife, Emily. - Lovely to meet you. Yeah, sorry, um, this is Vera. She's a friend. Sorry, so rude. Would either of you like a top off? - No. Thanks. - Okay. Snacks. Excuse me. Well, she seems nice. - Vera. - Hi. Hi. Um, what are you doing here? What do you mean? I wanted to celebrate Dennis' promotion. How did you even know about it? You mentioned it over coffee. Right. Um, but I, I didn't invite you. Juley, you said we're practically family. You, you meant that, right? Look, I know you have a lot on your plate today. Big party and all. Let's just have some fun. Okay? Hey. You okay? Yeah. Thanks. It must be hard. They say it gets easier. They can go to hell. Well, at least she's having a good time. So what's up with her? That woman is the recipient of Madison's heart. You're kidding me. Did you invite her? God! Jules, what's she doing here? That's what I'd like to know. She's still here. Whoo-hoo-hoo! That's what I call a good barbecue. It's almost like we're celebrating your birthday or something. You weren't invited. Dennis, please. We're family. No. We're not family. We don't want you here. You don't mean that. I mean, I know I got a little drunk, but I was just having fun. Didn't you have fun? And how else were we supposed to celebrate? No, see, I don't think you understand. We don't ever want to see you again. Is that clear enough for you? Dennis... Juley? You know, under the circumstances, Vera, I think, we, um... we just need a little time. Did I do something wrong? I see. Vera. We wish you well. We really do. And you can keep the money. You can. But please don't contact us again. I mean it. Okay. - I'm sorry that I overstepped. - It's okay. I didn't know I was causing so much trouble. You won't be seeing me again. What is that? - Do you hear that? - Yeah. It's been going on for, like, an hour. - I... - I-i-it kinda sounds like ours. - Well... Is it mine? - What? I think it's mine. - Let's go. - Come on. Come on. - Let's go. - All right. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. My God. My God. They're both... Both of the tires are slashed? - Right. - Are you kidding me? Well, I'm calling the police. I've had enough of this. - Here you go. - Thank you, Mrs. Cummings. - Do you want cream or sugar? - No, no. - This is, this is perfect. - Okay. Okay, now, do either of you have any idea who might've done this? We know exactly who did this. - We think we know who did this. - Are you serious? Look, if we're gonna get her arrested, then we should know that she actually did it. You're right, it was probably Mrs. Gardener across the street and her 85-year-old husband... - Yeah, probably it was them. - Okay, okay! Look, why don't you just tell me who you think it was? Okay. It... We had a barbecue earlier, small, couple of family friends and a, a woman who we both know showed up uninvited. And what makes you think it was this woman? She came back tonight and did this? I know it was her, I'm certain. Okay, was there an altercation at the barbecue? Did she make any threats that maybe would cause you to suspect her? We have a, a, we have a history with her. Okay, does she have a name? Vera. Her name is Vera. We don't know her last name. Okay. Look, Mr. and Mrs. Cumming, there is obviously more going on here, something you're not telling me. But, look, before we even get into that, let me just ask you a question. Did either of you actually see this Vera woman vandalize your car? - No. - Okay. Did that security camera out front capture her or her vehicle on the property at the time of the crime? - No. - No. Then, unfortunately, I'm sorry to say there is not much we can do. Even if you gave me or knew this woman's last name and I haul her down to the station, I have no doubt she would simply deny everything. Vandalism cases are always the hardest to prove, you know, usually because there's no conclusive evidence. So what are we supposed to? First thing tomorrow, call your insurance agent. Lovely. So tell them if they want me to go over the coms, I'm happy to do it, but my week is already crazy. And he's an architect, so he knows what he's looking at. Yeah. You got it. Do you want me to schedule time in the showroom? Just give me a second. Okay. Hey, what's up? Hey, so I spoke to Pacific Mutual and they're gonna cover all the damages. Great. Minus the $500 deductible. Wait, so she destroys our property and we owe 500 bucks? Yeah, well, that's a lot better than 5000, isn't it? I'm sorry, I didn't mean that that way. I'm just... I'm angry about everything. We'll talk about it later. I gotta go. Trouble in paradise? I wish it was just that. - Hello. - Hi. Hi. I just wanna say sorry again for what I said on the phone earlier. - Okay? - No. You were right. I never should've given her that money, I just... I don't know, like, I just really wanted to help her. Well, let's just chalk it up to getting a certified lunatic off of our back, right? I like that idea. - I like you. - Right. This reminds me of when we were first married. You picking me up at work. Yeah? I can get used to having my own personal chauffer again. - You could? - Yeah. Well, don't get too used to it because you car's ready tomorrow. Just a little. Almost.. - Wow, what is happening? - Little to your right. - To your right. To your right. - Okay. - Where are we? - Dan-ta-ta-tan. Voila! What? Well, how did, how did you do this? Well, I left work a little early and I came home before I picked you up, so... Aw. Thank you. You're welcome. Just ignore it. Okay. Go tell 'em to go away. All right. Hello? Who's there? Sorry, I didn't know, red or white, I took a gamble. Vera, what are you doing here? Well, I had so much fun at your barbecue that I wanted to swing by, bring you a little gift. I hardly think a cheap bottle of wine is gonna make up for the thousands of dollars of damage you've done to the car. The car? Okay, drop the act because it's getting old, Vera. I've no idea what you're talking about. The night of the barbecue, someone vandalized our car, smashed the window, slashed the tires. and you think that was me? Vera, you were really upset when you left. I'm... Who else could it be? Probably some stupid teenagers. Come on. Let's have a drink. We can start over. Okay? We need to call the cops. And say what? I told her I was drinking wine. - Well, we have to do something. - Okay, fine. I'll think of something. Come, you two. Join me. - Okay. - Okay, Vera. Well, what are you doing? I don't, I-I don't think somebody with a heart transplant should be drinking, right? Remember how I told you that I spent some time in Italy? They begin the day with fruit wine. Helps digestion. You know, my liver is made of iron. We are not in Italy. I don't know what you two are so upset about. Take this. Drink. I told you the other day that I wanted you to leave and never come back. I made that perfectly clear. Now leave, and don't ever come back. Okay! You're right. You're right. I'm sorry, I just... I thought that maybe we could put that behind us. I'm not gonna tell you again. - Get out of my house! - What is wrong with you? What would your daughter think if she saw you speaking to me like this? My daughter? My daughter? Get out of my house! Get out! Get out! You'll regret this. Hey, honey. What was so urgent? What is it? What's wrong? Explain this to me. A letter from the heart foundation. I'm sorry. I... I didn't wanna see you get hurt. Look, after you gave Vera the $5000... I was positive she was taking advantage of you. You were dishonest with me. Honey, you weren't gonna listen to me without proof. Right? I thought we weren't allowed to ask for the recipient's information. Well, they made an exception when I told them what happened. Hello, Williamson family. Hi. Well, by the time Sara was 11 or 12, it was obvious to the doctors that she needed a new heart. Technically, it's called an atrial septal defect. Practically, it means that the heart is dying. Without it, she wouldn't have made it to her 15th birthday. But then we got the news. It was the news we'd been praying for. A new heart had been found. Age, blood type, just the perfect match. Um... We aren't unaware that the happiest moment in our lives was your worst. Nothing prepares you for what to say. Um, but-but, um... thank you, just... Well, it just seems completely inadequate. Just know that we're grateful every single day. How are you feeling? I'm feeling good. I, I get tired sometimes, but I went back to school. She's doing great. Do you have a picture of your daughter? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Listen, if there's anything that we can do, please know that we're only a phone call away. Well, there is one more thing we wanted to ask you. Do either of you know a woman named Vera? Vera? Mid-twenties, long blonde hair. About Juley's height. I don't believe so. Who is she? It's nothing, just someone we thought you may have met through this whole process. Anyway, it was so lovely meeting you. Thank you for coming. - Take good care of yourselves. - You, too. Good luck to you. They were really nice. Yeah, this is why we did what we did, for that young girl. She's alive because of us. - Because of Maddie. - Yeah. Should we call Detective Quinn, tell him that Vera's not who she says she is? I don't know. Is it a crime what she did? I don't know. I mean, we gave her money under false pretenses and she destroyed our property. But she had that scar, though. Is it even real? Besides, you heard what the detective said. There's nothing we can do about the car. We would need proof. The money you gave voluntarily, even if she lied. We don't have a photo of her, we don't have a full na... Wait. We do have a full name. You would've written her... You would've written her full name on the check. What? To cash. I don't understand. You... You wrote a $5000 check to cash? I don't really wanna talk about it, Dennis. She lied to us for a reason. What, what could she want? I don't know. I don't know. - Hey. - Hey. What's wrong? You sound... Did something else happen? No. No, no, I'm fine. Just overwhelmed. Um, listen, I am not gonna make it back for dinner tonight. - Gotta work late. - Are you sure? I could pick up some food and bring it to you. At the office. No, no. I'm good. I will just see you at home. - Okay. Love you. - Love you, too. Bye. Excuse me? Are you okay? My baby... Ex-excuse me? Are you all right? Hey! Yeah, I'm okay. Paging Dr. Bender. Paging Dr. Bender, please. Knock, knock. May I come in? So... how are we feeling? I'm, I'm still really shook up, but I'm okay. She's lucky. If you can call it that. They said the wounds are superficial and that the knife didn't hit any major arteries, so... Thank goodness. I spoke to Lieutenant Bullock in the lobby. He was the cop that interviewed you at the scene. I figured since you've had a chance to rest, maybe you remember more. It was dark. I couldn't see her face, she was wearing a hat. Her? It was a woman? Yes. It was a woman. Yeah, the same woman we told you about at our house that's been harassing us and vandalized her car, that you've done nothing about. - Vera? - Right. Vera. Although, I'm not even sure that's her real name. Is there any other information you can give me that might help us lead to locating her? - Do you have a photo? - No. I don't have a photo. - She doesn't have a photo. - Okay. Well, Lieutenant Bullock also spoke with the building owner. It seems, apparently, that there were two other robberies at that lot just this past year. - I'm sorry, other robberies? - Yes. Other robberies. And until we find any additional evidence, that's exactly how we're treating this one. This woman didn't try to steal anything from me. She just attacked me with a knife. You have gotta be doing more than this. We are. We're looking at security-camera footage. Cars coming and going. But it seems our suspect entered on foot by the side wall. She knew how to avoid the cameras. What kind of detective work is that? Okay, so until you have something that you can share with us... I'd like to rest. I hope you feel better, Mrs. Cummings. Look, I'm really sorry about this. I am. Sorry. - Sorry. - It's okay. It's a remarkable story, Mr. and Mrs. Cummings. Very odd, very disturbing. We were hoping you could look into our files and see who made the inquiries. That way we could figure out who this woman is who's been harassing us. As you're well aware when you made the decision on behalf of your late daughter, you decided on what we call passive acknowledgement. If the recipient wanted to reach out to you, that would be acceptable, but you didn't want to initiate contact. Correct. Which is how this Vera contacted us. But when Mr. Cummings recently contacted us and said he wanted to change your status to be able to reach out to the recipient, I gave you the contact information of the Williamson family. Seems they had the same feeling as you. If the donor want to contact them, they were open to it. Right, but if that's true, then how would Vera have got our information? I mean, how would she know about us? Could be any number of ways. I'm sure you told some people. Things get overheard. But one thing is for certain, it didn't come from us. In our business, there's nothing we take more seriously than client confidentiality. It's what our whole business is predicated upon. But what if somehow there was some sort of mix-up and n-now this Vera woman thinks that she has Madison's heart? I can't see how that would happen. But it's not impossible, is it? Even if this was true, and I assure you it isn't, even if some rare and terrible mistake occurred, I-I would have no way of identifying this woman. She's about my height, she has long blonde hair, pale skin and she has, um, these marks on her arm right here. We thought they were from the IVs, but I mean, I guess they could be from anything. Mrs. Cummings, even if I recognize this woman, and I assure you I don't, I would be barred from telling you. - Confidentiality. - Exactly. That was an afternoon well spent. Do you think she knows more than she was saying? I doubt it. Even if she did, she doesn't seem like the kind of woman that's gonna crack. - Thank you. - I do kinda believe her. Mr. and Mrs. Cummings! Um, um... I'm Bethany, I-I'm Colleen's executive assistant. I-I-I overheard when you were talking to her about your... situation. Okay, give me five minutes. Just meet me in the back of the building. I may have something that can be of help. Ok-okay. Hi. You probably think that I'm out of my mind. - Is everything all right? - Well... You heard what Colleen said about confidentiality. It's just, it's an obsession with her. And honestly, she would probably fire me right now if she saw me talking to you. I really need this job, but, um... I'm afraid you might be in some serious danger and I won't be able to help myself if something happened to you. - Danger? - What? What, what do you mean? That woman that you were describing, the, the... - Vera. - Right. Vera. Um... She sounds like somebody who used to work at the foundation, right down to the scars on her arms. Only, her name wasn't Vera, it was Riley Leeds. Does that name mean anything to you? No. I-I don't think we have any idea who that is. About a month ago Riley just quit, she just left, um, she didn't even pick up her last paycheck. Honestly, we probably didn't vet her as thoroughly as we normally do because the... It was such a whirlwind after the death of... - Sorry. - That's okay. No, it's all right. One of our employees, she was murdered right here in the office. It was a... It was really, it really shook everybody up. Sorry. Anyway, um, Riley, she didn't work here for very long, but, um... there was always something strange about her. In what, in what way was she strange? Most of the people who work at the foundation, they're non-profit lifers. I don't know how well you two know this sector, but, um, the foundation and charities, other non-profits, they tend to attract the same type of person um, you know, who are not in it for the money. It's all about the cause. Right. And so Riley wasn't about the cause. It never felt that way. But I don't know, maybe that's because things were rough for her because of what happened to her. What happened? About six months ago her twin sister died in a car accident. She didn't talk about it that much, but, honestly, I don't blame her. Something like that should never happen to somebody. Anyway, um, the point is, that if this woman is trying to hurt you, then I just feel like you have the right to know. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah. Um, I-I better go. Okay. Good luck. - So... Okay. - Let's go. I can't believe I never looked before. No. Leeds. L-E-E-D-S. Riley Leeds. My God. She looks exactly like her. Please, sit down. Not much, I'm afraid. Now, what is it that you needed to see me about immediately? We know who's doing this. Her name is Riley Leeds. Her twin sister was killed in this car accident. It's the same accident that killed our daughter. I'm sorry? Can... Can you start from the beginning? Six months ago, our teenage daughter, Madison, was killed in a terrible car accident. The same accident that also claimed the life of Carrie Leeds, Riley Leeds' twin sister. I-I-I'm still not following. This woman who calls herself Vera is actually Riley Leeds. After Madison was killed, we donated her heart. Well, actually, all of her organs. Vera found us and said that she had received Madison's heart. But after all of this started happening and we looked into it, we found out who the actual recipient was. And it wasn't this Vera or Riley? Okay. If that were true, why would she wanna hurt you? The accident was Madison's fault. She was speeding and she hit Carrie Leeds going 60 miles an hour, head-on. Then with your daughter now deceased, you believe Riley Leeds blames you both for the death of her sister. No. She blames me. Madison was on her way to a surprise birthday party for Dennis. When the police recovered her phone... there were a dozen text messages from me around the time of the accident. Texts telling her to hurry up... warning her not to be late. It's my fault. Thank you, Mrs. Cummings... Mr. Cummings. Now I have a lead. Ma'am. - Are you Sugar? - Yeah. Is there a problem, officer? I got your information from your boss at Heartbreakers. Had a couple of questions. - May I come in? - Sure. Have a seat, officer. - Sorry about the mess. - It's okay. So how can I help you? When is the last time you saw Riley Leeds? Riley? Um... About six months ago. We-we used to be friends but then she lost her sister in a tragic car accident. Yeah. Um, your boss said there was an incident at work while you were both there. Yeah. Um... Well, Riley was never really the same after she lost her sister. I mean, she used to be so vibrant. You know what I mean, we would, we would laugh all of the time at work, which was great because it was always long and tough, especially with the kind of customers we get. This area's not really the Ritzy type, you know? Yeah. So, what happened? Um, it's not unusual for customers to get drunk and hit on you while you're serving drinks. But this one time Riley just snapped. I mean, she hit this guy and she just kept hitting him. She put him in a coma. He hasn't even woken up to this day. Boss wasn't around and Riley wanted me to keep it quiet. But I, I couldn't keep that secret, you know? I mean, I need this job, I have to pay for my brother's meds. So I told him. And he kicked her out. You know, it took everything just to keep Heartbreakers open for business after that. I haven't heard from her since. Can I ask what she did? I'm just gathering information right now, Sugar. But thank you for your time. And, if you think of anything else, please don't hesitate to, call or text me. Bailey, are you home? Did you even take your medicine? Bailey? Bailey, if you're playing games, this really isn't funny. Bailey? Hello, old friend. Sugar? You called me. Hey, it's Sugar. I'm not here right now. Leave a message. Bye. Sugar? - Mornin'. - Good morning. How'd you sleep? I slept well. How about you? Good. Really good, actually. I don't remember the last time I slept that good. That's good. I can't believe we went through all that. Yeah. That was a lot. But actually felt good to say it finally... that I feel guilty. For the longest time I just felt nothing, like, I wasn't here. I couldn't speak. Well, it's a process, right? What do you think will happen to Vera? - You mean Riley? - Yeah. Whatever. I think, it's out of our hands. And I think today's a new day. Speaking of which, I'm late for work. Would you like to get dinner with me after work? - Yes. - Okay. - Love you. - Love you - Bye. - Bye. I like when you smile. - Hey. - Hey. Davis wants to know if you feel well enough for a house call. - What do you mean? - You know, your arm. Look, I-I told you, I'm fine. When is it? - Today. - Today? It's 4:00. Can I go by in the mornin'? Hey, don't kill me, I'm just the messenger. But I have a sense that this could be a huge project, you know? Um, yeah, okay. Um, tell him I will be by. Just have to pack up. Okay, perfect. Here's the address. Thanks. Wait, isn't this Liz's project? Yes, but, apparently, they requested you. They had seen the Van Gotters property that you did and... - You know, you killed that. - Thanks. - Okay. - No problem. You got everything you need? - Good. - Hey. Keep that smile. - You got this. Have a good day. - Bye. You, too. You've reached the voicemail of Dennis Cummings. I'm sorry I missed your call. Please leave a brief message and I'll get back to you. Hey, honey, it's me. Um... I'm gonna be home later than I thought. Um, I've gotta head out to a client's house in a minute, but it is right by that new Italian place. So maybe we could meet up there. Okay, anyway, um, call me. Hey, listen, I can't talk right this second. I, just got to the client's house. Um, but it should just be a little bit, so... - Juley... - Dennis, you okay? I just called the police department. Detective Quinn is dead. Dead? Look, I have a real bad feeling about this. I want you to get in the car and I want you to drive home. Okay? Look, I, I can't right now, I'm, I'm... The client is inside the house waiting for me and this is a really big project for the company. Um, just, I-I'll be quick and then I'll, I'll get home right away, okay? Okay, fine, when you're done, you get in the car and drive home and I will meet you there. - And call me on your way. - I will. - I love you. - I love you, too. Come on in. It's open. Hello? Hello? It's Juley Cummings from Metro Design. Yes, I'm just down the hall. Where? There you are. Hello, Juley. Did you miss me? I missed you a lot. - You. - Sit down. Okay. Go ahead. Make yourself at home. Vera... this is not your home. Quick deductions there, Sherlock. I thought I killed the detective last night. Why? Why are you doing this? Juley, you're smarter than that. You know exactly why I'm doing this. I'm doing this for Carrie. Vera... that was an accident. An accident. I saw the police report. I read the texts. I read them so many times, they're burned into my brain. "Are you home, Madison? Your dad is always early. Get here now. He's on his way." Or my personal favorite. "Drive faster. Drive faster!" My sister is dead because your husband just had to be surprised at his stupid party. - Vera... - My name's not Vera. It's Riley. And my sister was Carrie Leeds. Say it. Say it! Okay. I'm sorry. Riley... I'm so sorry. It was a mistake. A terrible mistake. But I lost someone, too, that night and not a second goes by that I'm not reminded about what I did and who I lost. You are not alone in your grief. You don't have a twin sister. Do you, Juley? No. No, so you don't get it. You know, when I was younger, kids would make fun of me because I was quiet and shy. But not Carrie. Carrie was bold, fearless. I always wanted to be more like her. You know, she would beat up anybody who tried to bully me. She was my protector. We were bonded... tethered. I knew the moment she was killed because I felt her leave me. She was gone. I was so lost. - Riley... - Don't do that. Sorry. I'm sorry. Seeing that police report... seeing you... I realized that I could be strong, too. If not for me, then for her. It was fun. Getting to play along with you for a little bit, I almost believed it. Did you like thinking I had your daughter's heart? Did you like playing mommy? Call Dennis. It's time for him to join the party. What if I don't? That's easy. Give me your phone, mummy. Do it! Thank you. Right, you're gonna tell him you need a ride, that your car broke down and you need him to pick you up. Where are you? Are you on your way home? Dennis... I need you to come get me. My car won't start. I, I need you to pick me up. Jules, you don't sound like yourself. What's going on? Jules? Juley, where'd you go? The doors are locked from the outside. There's nowhere to hide. Where'd you go? Knock, knock. Come on out, Juley. I might even kill you quickly. I mean, Carrie didn't have it so easy, but I'm... I'm not a monster like you. By the way, I was wondering, how did Madison die? Was it, was it quick or, or, or did she die slowly, too? I'm bored. This is your last chance. Hey, when I kill Dennis, I'll tell him he should've driven faster. That was easy. No, no. Babe, babe. Are you okay? Hey, take a deep breath. - I'm okay. - Take a deep breath. I'm okay. Let's, let's go. - Okay. - Go. Hey, Riley. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. Yeah.
