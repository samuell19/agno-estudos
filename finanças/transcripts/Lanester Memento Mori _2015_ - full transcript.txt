Hey, stop it! Sorry, I came on too strong. It's fine, forget it. To make up for it. No, thanks. Come on, it'll relax you. You look stressed. I'm not stressed, I'm fine. I said I'm fine. At least give us a small hug. Back off. Let go of me, arsehole! Who the fuck are you? 5 seconds to drop your toothpick and get out of here. One, two, three, four... Who do you think you are? My father? Just someone who worries about you. I don't need your worry. I don't need it, see? - I spoke to your neighbour. - What? She told me I would find you here. She also said you got thrown out of your flat. Is it true? It was Daphné's flat. Her father wants it back. I miss her so much. All right. Tonight you're staying over at your old man Lanester's. Thank you, it's kind of you. It's only normal. Not long ago you saved my backside. This is the least I can do. Can I ask you a question? Go ahead. If that guy last night had tried to stab you, would you have shot him? - No. - Not even in the leg? Nope. I wasn't armed. Bloody hell. Where was your piece? Lanester. I'm on my way. Take it easy today. We'll grab a bite to eat tonight and catch up a little. All right? All right. Delphine Arnault, 15. She was being treated for anorexia. On the way to the clinic her mother stopped for fuel and the girl slipped away. Her condition makes her a vulnerable minor. Since when do we do runaways? Since the judge said so. The clinic has had three disappearances in 3 months and the police are getting nowhere. The medical report on your problem with your eyesight last month states you can't drive any official vehicle for a little while. - You must be joking! - I'm afraid not. They don't want you going blind speeding down the highway. - Neither do I. - What am I supposed to do? Ride a bicycle? Get Kaminski to ferry you. I reckon the cap will suit him. Gabrielle, it's Lanester. I have a proposition for you. In exchange for staying at my place, you drive me around. No, I haven't gone blind again. I'll explain. What do you say? Great. You start immediately. I left Delphine in the car while I paid. - Directly? - Yes. Pity you have no CCTV cameras. Well, business isn't exactly booming. I can't afford them. No vehicle stopped by while you were here? No car, motorbike or scooter? - No. - Are you sure? Your back was turned. Yes, if a car had pulled up, I would have heard it. - And Thomas would have seen it. - Sure. Definitely. You're right. You can't miss a thing from here. In fact, how did you not see Delphine leave the car? It must have happened while I was at the till. Max, take some pictures. Why don't you draw a picture while you wait? What a pretty girl you are! - What's your name? - Juliette. - I think that'll be all. - Bye, Thomas. - Sorry I'm late. You OK? - Yes. Inspector Lanester is leading the investigation. Must we go through questioning again? I'm afraid so. For the sake of being thorough. And who's looking for my daughter? A dozen officers in addition to those already on the case. I hope you'll be less dim. What do you mean? They believe Delphine ran away. - Given the circumstances... - Bugger that! I know - we know she didn't run away. Despite her illness, we're a close-knit family, I would have sensed it. So you noticed nothing unusual in her behaviour lately? - No. - Remember what I said? I even told the police officers. A feeling I had last weekend. She seemed more relaxed and calm, as if... As if she had made a big decision? For my part, I noticed nothing. You can contact us at any time if you need anything. But please, just find her. I'll do everything I can. Believe me. - Thank you. - Goodbye. This is for you. Wow, thank you. It's so pretty! She's too cute. Roll up your window, honey. So, any theories? She wasn't taken by humans or aliens. So two scenarios. One: she ran away on impulse. Her mother stops, she skedaddles and treks to the next village. But she's too thin and weak to make the distance. Yet no one saw her. Two: she planned to run away. She knows her mother stops here every Monday morning. She runs off and meets a friend waiting at a hiding place. Max? It's unlikely she was kidnapped. Her parents are successful. No ransom demand has yet been made. As for a sexual predator just passing by and snatching her in plain sight... One thing's for sure: she's gone. Notice something between the mother and the attendant? First name basis. Thomas this, Thomas that. I don't call my shopkeepers by their first names. I don't even know them. You think there might be some hanky-panky going on? She's back to normal. - "She's back to normal"? - What? Kaminski said "She's back to normal". Did he now? What did you tell them? That I was abnormal? You think you're my mother? I don't need one. I never had much of a mother, so a grouchy cop isn't... Marx. What? Groucho Marx. You do drama, I do comedy. Very funny. Delphine Arnault, 15. Went missing Monday. Anorexic, diagnosed 2 years ago. Father runs an IT hardware firm, mother is a housewife. One sister, Juliette, 5. Delphine ran off while her mother was filling up at this station which is about 10km from the clinic, the building on the left, where she boards in the week. The second missing girl - or rather the first to go missing - is Sarah Shaloub. Sixteen, went missing October 20th. Only child, mother died when she was 9, father is a GP in the western suburbs. Diagnosed with anorexia at 14. Sarah ran away from the clinic. Both girls were patients at the Saint-Martin clinic. It specializes in treating anorexia. How old is the photo? Two years: her parents have nothing more recent because Delphine refused to have her picture taken. Could you zoom in on her hands? They're paper-thin, and she's skin and bones. So her eating disorder had already begun. But how did her parents not notice? Anorexics are always smart, they find clever ways to conceal their condition. Some eat normally during meals and vomit in secret. All to look like a model. I don't think it's all about that. As you know, the chances of finding a missing person plummet after 48 hours. Delphine's been gone 96 hours. The situation is grave. As for Sarah, work it out yourselves. I want each family placed under surveillance. Monitor all their phones and their bank accounts. Also pull up the records of all the staff at the clinic. Let's get to it. Anorexia nervosa is a psychological loss of appetite. A severe eating disorder marked by the obsession of losing weight. Or by the pathological fear of putting on weight. - Do we know what triggers it? - Not really. It can be a way of taking control of one's life and body when entering the agony of puberty. - Dr Vildelstein. - Thank you. It can also be a way of being invisible in the eyes of one's family which one no longer feels a part of. Or escaping overattentive parents. In exceptional cases. The opposite is more common. Wanting to stop growing to be loved as a little girl. Anorexia can have several causes depending on the sufferer. It's an illness that must be endured even if some girls treat those around them like little tyrants. Do you have anyone in mind? Don't expect me to name names. You would jump to conclusions. Mr Shaloub, before she ran away, your daughter didn't act different? No. No change in behaviour, no odd or casual remarks? No. But you said the two of you were very close. We don't see what's under our noses. After my wife passed away, I devoted myself to Sarah. I wanted to try fill the void. I even set up my practice here so as to be closer to her. And yet... I didn't see it coming. Was she happy to be hospitalized? Of course not. She blamed me. I was convinced it was for the best. She was 14. The next year she faded. She's beautiful. She looked like her mother. "Looked" like? Sorry? You spoke of her in the past tense. I assume you're familiar with the statistics. The chances of finding a child missing for 3 months are virtually zero. Don't ever lose hope, Mr Shaloub. Our job is to prove the statistics wrong. We'll get going. We'll call you if we have news. You can call me at any time. My number's on the back. "You can call me at any time." What? Have you fallen for Dr Zhivago? Whatever! Whatever? Your lashes were batting so fast, you almost took off. I admit he's good-looking. Not Omar Sharif, but good-looking. Don't you find it odd that he hasn't moved on? He's well off and handsome... Bit strange. You just can't wrap your head around a man being faithful to his wife. - She's been dead 6 years. - So? Hang on, look. All of a sudden he's in a hurry. Where's he going? He's headed to the park. - Can you still see him? - No. Shit, where did he go? I can't see him. Where is he? Look there. No, go around again. Fuck, damn it. We lost him. It seemed odd, so we followed him. We lost him by the Bois de Boulogne. He shook you off? I don't think so. Too much traffic. All right. Back to work. - I understand them. - Who? The runaways. I wouldn't last 2 days here. Would you like to swing by? Where? To go see your brother. Weren't you thinking about him? Hello, Xavier. How are you? Don't you want to go for a walk? - J. Bergeret has ceased practising. - How come? I'm afraid I can't tell you. I'm surprised you didn't know. She told all her patients. - She didn't call you? - No. Probably because I wasn't yet a patient of hers. I just went to see her for a... specific problem. Psychogenic blindness brought on by repressed childhood memories. I thought that... once I knew the cause of the problem I could handle it alone, but I couldn't. I realized I still needed to see her. Shall I recommend you someone? Why not you? You're under no obligation to stick with the same practice. Once you choose a psychoanalyst, you have to commit. I'll take the risk. Plus I know the way here. All right. Here are my contact details. Please send her... my regards. What the hell is this? I wanted to change a dud bulb this morning but I found none. So I changed the lamp. I found an unused one upstairs. But then the table didn't match, so... And what's that? Those are flowers. They grow in fields. Gabrielle, I said you could stay, not redecorate the place. - Don't you like it? - That's not the point. What now? I'll put it back how it was and throw this away. No, it's fine, leave it. We'll see later. You suck. You suck! Yeah? Éric, we've got another runaway. Wait for me over there. Mélissa Terrail, barely 16. She didn't show up for the morning treatment. Roadblocks? Nothing yet. Of our 15 rooms, 13 are occupied. One is for medical care. Some patients sometimes have fits that endanger them. Mélissa was transferred here after her fit. Relax girls, I'm also here for a fag. Are you a cop? - Is it that obvious? - Not really. Not at all, in fact. Maybe it's because I'm just a trainee at the moment. Can I have one? Don't worry, I won't tell. Cheers. How well do you know Mélissa, the runaway? Not very well. We weren't really friends. Why's that? Because she's a bitch. Well, that explains it. She's a shitty person. That's why she got on so well with Sarah. Sarah? Sarah Shaloub. She ran away 3 months ago. Right, Sarah. Total nutcase. But Delphine was cool. Who knows why they were mates. - You know why. - Why? - Their delusion... - Right. They made up an imaginary house where no one would tell them what to do. The total opposite of here. - Are you mistreated? - It's not that. It's just that we can't say that we're not sick and don't belong here. But we're minors. And so we have to shut up. That said you don't seem worried about your friends. What if they were abducted? Abducted? Sarah and Mélissa? They'd drive the poor bugger mad. I see. TV, board games, study/reading room. A teacher comes here daily to give lessons. And four computers are available. Naturally unsafe websites like those promoting anorexia are blocked. - Did Mélissa use them? - Yes. - Delphine and Sarah too? - As all our patients. Pull up their browsing histories. - May I? - Be my guest. You told me girls were your only patients? Strictly speaking anorexia nervosa is a female disorder. - Do we know why? - Not really. Clinical data are rare in France. There are many theories. But nine out of ten sufferers are teenage girls. So much for gender equality. Equality is not a scientific notion. I'll need the missing girls' files. You'll have them as soon as I have a warrant. You'll have it today. Meanwhile you should speak to your staff and go over your rules. None of our rules were broken. Doctor, one patient runs away, fine. Two, call it gross negligence. But three... What can I say? This clinic isn't a prison and I'm not a cop. Thanks for the smoke. Sure. Don't grass on us. Promise. But you also have to promise me something. Don't run away, OK? Where were you? Having a smoke. You smoke? No, I was chatting. I didn't want Mélissa to be confined. - Hospitalized. Please, now's not the time. So when is it the time? You insisted she go there. The shrink advised it. What would a mechanic know compared with a shrink...? Since when do strangers know better than parents? I can still see the look she gave me that day. We had to do it, it was the only- The only way was to keep her at home! With us! Any idea where she could have gone? Family, friends? If I knew where she was, I wouldn't be here, would I? Excuse me. - Mélissa's parents? - Yes. What have you got? Nothing special. The nurses are devastated but told us nothing new. The patients are happy to keep mum. What's clear is that none of them are worried. Some even admire them for their courage. Yet it isn't hard to sneak out. Some girls even go into town to buy smokes. Gabrielle told me she had a puff with two patients this morning. Seems Delphine, Sarah and Mélissa were eager to bolt. It would appear so. One thing's strange, though. After Mélissa had her fit, her vitals should have been checked by a nurse. But there's no record of them. - How come? - No one could tell us. The shifts are passing the buck. It gets better. Her things weren't locked away. - They were left on a chair. - Meaning? Meaning if someone wanted to help her escape, there was no better way. The bus driver remembers a girl. His description fits Mélissa. That's her all right. I've picked up a few scrawny girls at the same stop. I didn't know about the clinic. Inspector, we have a trail! Come on. Come on, boy. There you go. Get me the caretaker now. Deep gash at the base of the skull. Two broken teeth. May I? "On absence without longing "On naked solitude On the steps of death "I write your name" "Freedom" Sorry? "On health restored On risk no more "On hope without mind I write your name "By the power of a word "I begin my life anew I was born to know you "To name you: Freedom" Paul Éluard. Door locked from the inside. Windows closed and intact. No floor marks. No blood stains other than hers. "The presbytery has lost none of its charm, "nor the garden its radiance." The Mystery of the Yellow Room. Except here, no traces of blood on the walls. Only Mélissa's prints on the tap and the sink. This crime scene isn't talking. I think the reason your crime scene isn't talking is that it isn't a crime scene. The blow to her skull didn't kill her. She banged her head several times against the floor. There are signs of suffocation but not of strangulation or of external choking. Given how she bit her tongue and her bladder gave in... Epilepsy? I'd say psychogenic polydipsia. The compulsive need to drink fluids. She must have drunk a dozen litres. Due to pressure from the inrush of fluid, the brain swells. That triggers an epileptic fit which in turn causes loss of consciousness, vomiting and inhaling of the stomach contents. She drowned? Yes, that's the cause of death. As for her anatomy, she has no breasts or pubic hair. And she was a virgin. There are also signs of old and repeated scratching. She scratched her private parts until she drew blood. She obviously had a score to settle with her womanhood. You all right, inspector? Excuse me. My mother had just yelled at Xavier. He began scratching his cheeks and his neck harder and harder until he drew blood. When I saw that on the cadaver, my eyes blurred, I couldn't breathe. Just like last month. Could I relapse? Go blind again? Psychogenic blindness is not a recurring condition. Tell that to the police head doctor. He doesn't want me to drive. Please sit down. I'm fine, thanks. I'm no longer ill. The symptoms you showed last month indicate that your mental defences were overwhelmed. It may now be that other repressed memories are coming back to the surface. Mr Lanester, if you wish to begin psychoanalysis, we'll have to lay down some rules. First, no more sudden visits. And our sessions will be held seated face to face. In psychoanalysis, forcing the body to be still is part of the process. Excuse me. Yes, Charles? We're at an Internet café. Seems Mélissa went here after she got off the bus. I'm on my way. I'm sorry, I have to go. And you must switch your phone off. She was so sweet, so fragile. She didn't have money to pay, so I let her use it for free. Which computer did she use? That one. Have these girls been here before as well? They also ran away. This one, yes. But her, I'm not sure. But her face rings a bell. Don't you have CCTV cameras? No. Should I? Éric. She went onto one site only. That of the clinic. Six times in 2 minutes. It lists all the dangers of anorexia but nothing about Éluard or poetry. It's weird, though. She runs away from the clinic and then goes onto its website? Mr Kumar, this must stay between us. Don't tell anyone that Mélissa is dead. All right. Why? Sarah, Delphine, Mélissa. Three friends, three runaways. Mélissa died on her way to meet up with the other two. Whoever's waiting for her doesn't know she's dead. If she doesn't show up soon, they'll begin to worry. Then they'll appear. Vildelstein will say it wasn't his fault. You don't seem to like him much. I don't. After Sarah ran away, he should have taken measures. He did nothing. I hold him partly responsible. - The clinic "isn't a prison". - Sorry? That's what he answered me when I confronted him. That's right. Not guilty but responsible. Can I count on your silence with regard to Mélissa? Yes. Here I am, don't stress. I just popped into the pharmacy. I'm feeling a bit off. Your concern is overwhelming. - The black Mercedes. - What about it? Follow it. Yes, sir! Adam, it's Éric: when you tailed Shaloub, did you lose him by the gardens? That's right. I'm behind him now near there. - You want backup? - No. Stop over here. Want me to go with you? Couples attract less attention. Yes? He's coming back to his car. You picking mushrooms or what? What's going on? Your officers wouldn't tell me. Have you found the body? Why should there be a body? Don't you think your daughter is still alive? What were you doing here earlier? - What? - I followed you. What were you doing here earlier? Nothing, I just went for a walk. - You went for a walk? - Yes. Don't make me come back here and turn this place upside down. Wait, this is ridiculous. What the fuck were you doing here? The same as you! Screaming. It's the only place I can without being heard. My daughter is dead. I know it. I can feel it. Éric. You OK, Éric? Take him back. Éric? Éric, what's going on? Are you OK? You should see somebody. - Charles. - What? Please mind your own bloody business. Yes, Carla? I've gone through the staff. Quite the turnover. Resignations, extended sick leave, short-term leave... Since Vildelstein arrived, someone has left every year. The last was N. Marquant, the physio, fired for professional misconduct 5 months ago. What kind of misconduct? She was caught having a smoke with a patient. She was fired for that? That's what it says. Where does she stay? Vallée de Chevreuse. True, I shared a cigarette with Sarah to calm her after a panic attack. Even so, it was an open secret that many girls smoked. So you weren't fired for that? - No. - Why, then? Let's say Dr Vildelstein and I didn't see eye to eye. In what way? In addition to physiotherapy, I conducted photographic therapy. We spent a lot of time together working on their body images. It created a bond with some patients. He disliked that. He accused me of exceeding my remit and acting like a psychologist. Do you have any idea where they could have gone? The officers asked me that after Sarah left. But given your close relationship with the girls, maybe one of them let something slip. Honestly, no. I'm sorry. Does the poem Freedom by Éluard mean anything to you? Éluard? No. Why? So what do you do now? Still physiotherapy? No, I give photography lessons here. This priory belongs to my partner. An old international reporter. Hi, sorry, I really need to go. May I use your loo? She's my driver. Can't it wait? Please, come in. - Thank you. - No problem. Let me show you the way. After you. Can I help you, miss? Oh, no. I'm sorry. I went to the loo and got lost. You're not the first. This way. It's really quite lovely here. Thank you - ah, Byron. The young lady got lost. This is Insp. Lanester. Byron Croft, my partner. The old international reporter. International no longer, but definitely old. Mr Lanester is looking into the Saint-Martin runaways. Any progress? Slowly but surely. In my day police officers were never so pretty. Maybe that's because she isn't a police officer. She's my driver. Excuse me. But the compliment remains, miss. Thank you. Thank you for your time. You're welcome. Let me show you out. Partial to flattery, are we? What are you talking about? - You were swooning. - No I wasn't. - Yes you were. - Not at all. I'm telling you. Are you going to do this to me every time? Don't you think we could talk once in a while? I'm snowed under with work, but I do my best to come see you. I'm doing it to try to reconnect with you. What's the point if you don't make an effort? Xavier, I'm talking to you. You all right? I juggle with my job to see him but it's as if I didn't exist. - Did you speak to him? - Sure. Like a normal person? My brother isn't normal. You know that, but does he? Let's go, I'm bushed. There, I knew I'd seen it somewhere. - What? - The photo in Croft's office. Of the Haitian refugee playing Shakespeare. - He showed you his office? - No. I got lost leaving the loo and the door was open. And? In 1991 it won the World Press Photo of the Year. Croft was in a boat with 40 wretches trying to get to Miami. While checking the hull underwater, the captain brought up a skull. The boat sank on the way. Only 14 survived, including Croft. How is it relevant? It isn't. All right. His work is very specific. A bit strange, too. How so? As if the subjects had their photos taken against their will. I don't know... one even looks like he's crying for help. A photo is like a painting, it's subject to interpretation and the eye of the beholder. Who would have thought. What? That you and I would agree. I've found something. You should have a look. A certain Vincent Meniel. He's worked with Croft. Not his biggest fan. "A fanatic who stopped at nothing "to get a scoop." Is this Meniel famous? Not like Croft, in any case. He's never won an award. Probably jealous. Right, I'm off to bed. Yes, of course. You want to shower first? - You go ahead. - Don't stay up too late. - Hey, I'm not your daughter. - Thank God. Kindly contact Insp. Lanester about a police investigation into Byron Croft. Xavier, stop. Xavier, I said stop. Stop it! Éric. Éric? It's Kaminski. Yes, Charles? C. Arnault called Thomas Valdini, the petrol attendant. She's meeting him in 1 hour. Who calls their petrol attendant to arrange a meeting? It's not what you think, Inspector. What do I think, Mrs Arnault? What are... All right, you've got me. I was in the back when Delphine ran off. Why didn't you tell us? I was ashamed. Antidepressants don't work for me, so I smoke a little to cope. To forget what was said to me. What was said to you? Delphine's first shrink. When her anorexia was diagnosed, he suggested that I might be stifling her with my love. That in drifting into anorexia, she was unconsciously shunning me. The only thing I understood was that everything was my fault. And it's true. It's all my fault. I'm not a good mother, Mr Lanester. I'm not a good mother. You're not a bad mother, Mrs Arnault. My mother would yell at him to stop, but he couldn't help it and kept hurting himself. I can still see my mother's face. She seemed so lost and powerless. So I did what my father would have: I slapped him. He looked at me, began to cry and went to his room. After my father died, my mother couldn't cope. I thought it was up to me to step into his shoes and assume the paternal authority that he had so abused, as though we can only replicate what we've seen before. So whenever Xavier did that... I'd hit him. You thought you had to be someone who you couldn't be. But now, are you who you need to be? All good? Okey-dokey... - Yes. - Insp. Lanester. It's R. Arnault. My wife tried to kill herself. Doctor, one minute. What happened? Drug overdose. - But she should be fine. - Thank you. OK, we're done. Let's go. Why did she do that? Let's go inside, we need to talk. I have to call my sister to come watch over Juliette. Juliette? Is mummy sick? Yes, but don't worry. She'll be fine. The doctors will look after her. Come, give me a hug. Remember that lovely drawing you made for me? I still have it, you know. You're very good. I couldn't draw that well when I was your age. Yes you can, it's easy. Maybe for you, but I can't even draw a banana...! Please hurry. I can't believe it. Leaving Delphine alone to buy drugs like a common addict. Calling your wife an addict is somewhat unfair. Delphine was determined to run away one way or the other. Say what? How can you say that? I think Delphine and Mélissa planned to meet Sarah. Mélissa was unlucky. If you're right, it means she's alive somewhere. I hope so. Where's Juliette? In her room. So who's that? That's me and mum and dad. I guess those are girls, judging by their hair. That's Delphine and her friend. Right, her friend. - What's her name again? - Sarah. That's right, Sarah. You drew that house next door. - But it isn't, is it? - No, else we'd see it. Of course. - Do you know where it is? - No. She told her before she went missing. She made her swear to keep it a secret between them. It confirms our suspicions all along. We must go over it all. We already have. We'll do it again. Team meeting tomorrow at 8am. All right. I should bawl you out. And congratulate me too. Let's call it quits, then. It's strange, though. What's strange? Maybe it's nothing. Spit it out. The house in Juliette's drawing with her sister and Sarah. What about it? When I spoke to those two girls, they also mentioned a house where Sarah, Delphine and Mélissa dreamt of living happily. Now you tell me? It came to my mind now. You can't just barge in! You must wait for Dr Vildelstein! Rachel, I'm Insp. Lanester. What? I'm investigating your friends. I want you to tell me exactly what you told her 2 days ago in the park. About what? Their dream house. What about it? I don't understand. Where is it? It doesn't exist. What do you mean? It's an imaginary place. Like Wendy. Who's Wendy? Wendy, Peter Pan... the house was their Neverland. Come on. Éric, the gull pinched my sandwich! What are you doing up at 2am? Playing tennis. - What? - You have to come see this. Where are you going? Taking the dog out. Go back to bed. All right. This poem thing was bothering me. So I tried to find a connection between Éluard and anorexia. Nothing, but it gave me an idea. I found it odd that Mélissa went six times onto the clinic's website. So I copied her. I went on and off several times. Nothing changed except for the pop-ups. The banner ads that appear when browsing the Web. There it is. It links to a swotting website for revising French classics, including Éluard and Freedom. Now if you click on the second stanza like this, you go to a very interesting blog. A real sight for sore eyes. It gives plenty tips for those who think skinny is sexy. Loads of them. What food is most easily brought up. How to conceal one isn't eating. Or how to lose several kilos in one week. If you click the contact box, you can send a message. - Which you did. - Yes. My name is Charlotte, I'm 15 and anorexic. And my parents are a pain. No reply yet. Can we find out whose blog this is? With an international warrant. It seems to be hosted in Ireland. It'll take 15 days or so. That's too long. I know. In any case, whoever is behind this is pretty good. Creating a path like that isn't easy. You also need access to the source code. I saved the best for last. I managed to pinpoint the computer used to make the clinic's website. Not Vildelstein's? No: Shaloub's. I have nothing to do with that. Then who? Sgt Kaminski said one had to have the codes for the link. I don't know. The site was meant to share my experience with families out there. To give advice on how to act towards anorexics. I didn't want anyone else to have to go through what I did. Didn't the clinic have its own site? No, Vildelstein is allergic to new technology. Surely you mentioned the website to him? Of course I did. He even helped me with the content. - Him and others. - Who? Staff members - Nathalie Marquant, the former physio, in particular. Nathalie Marquant? Her help was invaluable. Excuse me. Yes? Someone's on Skinny Lonely. It's us, we're with Shaloub. No, it's coming from a computer at the clinic. They're leaving a message on the contact page. Who? Hold on. Her name is Rachel. Delphine told me what to do. One day I surprised her and Mélissa talking. That's how they would join Sarah. In the house of fancy? Yes. They said Sarah was waiting for them there. Did she say where? She didn't even know where it was. She just told me the four rules. Rule 1: right to your own body. Rule 2: right to speak or be silent. Rule 3: right to eat or not eat. Rule 4: right to live or die. Do you think this house is real? I don't know. At first I thought it was a joke but then I thought "Why not?". Have you got a reply to your message? No. You seem sure they're fine. Don't you think they might have been caught by a bad person? No way. They're much too sly. Especially Sarah. Nasty, but very sly. Nasty? I thought she was nice. Sarah, nice? Who told you that? Marquant? No wonder, she was her pet. And by pet I mean... What are you saying? Rachel. They had a relationship. What do you mean by that? An affair. That's why Marquant was fired. Hello? Hi, it's Anil Kumar. May I speak to Insp. Lanester? He's busy, go ahead. I've just received an e-mail that was sent to Mélissa. It seems to be from someone she contacted from here. I didn't say she was dead. I just said she'd be here round noon. Was that good? Very good, I'll tell Insp. Lanester. Please ask him to call me. To tell me what to do. Sure, don't worry. You can't just barge in like this! That story about the cigarette was a load of bullshit. That's not why you fired N. Marquant. Please. The cigarette story is true. But it was a pretext. How did you learn about N. Marquant and Sarah? I was told. By who? Give me that confidentiality crap and I'll collar you. By Sarah. Delphine and Mélissa confirmed it. I fired her reluctantly. She was very good at her job. N. Marquant left in September. Sarah ran away in October. Mightn't she have gone to her place? Sure. The police checked, she wasn't there. Nathalie may have erred in her job, but to be a runaway's accomplice... - Sir? - Yes? Your driver left this for you. Thank you. Where is she? - Anil Kumar? - Yes, hello. Hi, we spoke over the phone. I'm working with Insp. Lanester. Right. - The inspector isn't here? - He's busy elsewhere. Tell me about the e-mail. This is Insp. Lanester. You tried to call me? I spoke to your colleague. Did she tell you? Tell me what? Who? The one who came. With the cap. She said she was with you, and she replied to the e-mail that was sent to Mélissa. - Then she left. - Just like that, without a word? No. I mean yes. Can we see the e-mail she got? No, it was deleted straightaway. Did I mess up? Don't blubber all over again! She posed as Mélissa and went to the meeting place. Gabrielle as an anorexic? Is she mad? Go figure. Put out a search on her cab. Here's the numberplate. 806-CDG-92. Got it. I'm on it. OK, thanks. Her phone is off. Yes? - Insp. Lanester? - Yes. - This is Vincent Meniel. - Who? Vincent Meniel, you asked me to contact you regarding Byron Croft. About a police investigation. You're the international reporter? I do wildlife photography now. Not as warped. What do you want to know? Can I call you back, Mr Meniel? Yes, but in a month. I'm about to get on a plane. I'm off to shoot whales. Right, I see... I'll cut to the chase. I'm not one to finger colleagues. But I'll make an exception for Croft. He was a real arsehole. - Meaning? - He had no scruples. He had the courage and talent that others lacked. But he developed a morbid fascination with violence and suffering. Could you be more specific? The last time I worked with him was in May 2008 in Lebanon. We came across a badly maimed kid. While I went to get help, Croft stayed with him. When I got back, the kid was dead. Croft was still taking pictures. There was a kind of ecstasy in his eyes. I realized he had crossed the line. Thank you for calling. What is he accused of, exactly? Let's go. - Where are we going? - Now! Adam, it's me, where are you? We'll be there in 15 minutes. Police, open up! Police! Éric! Take the enforcer. Carla, Adam, take the back. Looks like they left in a hurry. Get me the most recent numbers to and from this telephone. Éric, look at this. It's a memento mori. - Charles, you there? - Go ahead. We've found a door behind the house. Carla, call the paramedics. Charles? You, that door. Gabrielle? Gabrielle, are you there? Bust it open. - It's OK. - I wanted to help. I wanted... I know. It's Sarah. Éric, we've got Delphine! Take care of her. It's over, Delphine. We're the police. It's over. Where's the ambulance? Carla, where's the ambulance? They're on their way. It's OK, Delphine. It's OK. You could have died. Were you trying for a medal or what? I just wanted you to acknowledge that I exist. What? Of course you exist. You've existed at my place for some time. Being near isn't the same as being close. Seriously, you sound like my... Your wife? You don't have one. Your mother? She's dead. Your overpriced shrink? You're more unbearable than usual after seeing her. Éric. Before leaving he called British Airways to inquire about flights to New York. - How long ago? - 50 minutes. But there are flights leaving from Orly and Charles de Gaulle. I have an idea. Central, this is 153 Bravo. Go ahead, 153 Bravo. Can you patch me into the network? - Reason? - Police investigation. I'm with the cops. I mean the police. This is Insp. Lanester. What Gabrielle said is correct. Roger that. - Go ahead, Gabi. - Thanks. Gabi calling everyone. Gabi calling everyone. I need your help, guys. I'm looking for a black Range Rover. Numberplate 898-FCN-92. To Orly or Charles de Gaulle. Does anybody copy? That won't work, but each to his own. Charles, call the border police and get the word out. We can't let him take off. Gabi, baby, it's Babacar. I'm on the A86. A matching car just overtook me. I'm looking where he's going. He's taken the A1 interchange towards Lille. Traffic is heavy and slow. Thanks Babacar, you're the best! Adam, clear the road. Charles, behind me. Let's go. Aren't you barred? I've unbarred myself. Let's go, baby! Everyone, Mehdi here. I'm on the A1 behind your vehicle. Got it, thanks Mehdi. - Gabi, Béa here. - Go ahead, Béa. Your vehicle just overtook me. He's taking the slip road to Charles de Gaulle. Thanks a million, Béa. Adam, to Charles de Gaulle. Roger that. He's headed for Terminal 1. Roger that. He's heading to the drop-off. We're almost there. Switch off your police lights. Adam, go slowly and wait for us. Charles and Max, with me. You stay in the car. All right. Byron, what are you doing? Byron! What are you doing? Byron! It's Sarah. You OK? Why didn't you shoot? When Sarah began telling me about her house of fancy, I indulged her fantasy. I thought it could even help her. But once she roped in Delphine and Mélissa, I ended our little sessions. It made her angry. She threatened me. She said she would accuse me of touching her. I didn't think she would do it. But she did. Dr Vildelstein took her word for it. He fired me just like that. One month later, Sarah showed up at the priory. She had run away to come say sorry. But it was too late. The damage was done. So you decided to lock her up and leave her to die. Not me. Byron. He said she had cost me my job and my honour and deserved to be punished. What about Delphine? And Mélissa? They were guilty by association. How could she? She was under his spell. Bullshit. She could have helped those girls. Assuming she'd have wanted to. Were they really willing to die? Rule 3: right to eat or not eat. Rule 4: right to live or die. What's up? I'm quitting the team. I'm no longer fit to be your boss. What? I couldn't pull the trigger earlier. You hesitated, it happens. I didn't hesitate. I couldn't do it. This time I put myself in danger, but next time it could be you or somebody else. When I went blind last month, events from my past resurfaced. Memories of me, my brother and my father. He killed himself with his service revolver in our room. Give me your gun. Maybe you just need time. No, this is permanent. What good is a cop who can't shoot? You should see someone. I am, it isn't helping. I wanted to tell you first before the chief. What will you do? I don't know. Get transferred to a cushy desk job. OK, keep me posted. Maybe I'll join you. Me too. Great idea. I'm tired of chasing scumbags. You're all bonkers. We take after our boss. Right, I'm off to go swim. To go what? Can I join you? Can I take you home? Gabrielle's waiting for me, thanks. Remember, we're all bonkers. You OK? Yes. You sure? - Close your eyes. - What? Close your eyes. What's this? It's a medal, obviously. It's a chocolate one, but you still deserve it. I expect a taste. Definitely not, it's my medal. No. How is she? She won't speak to us. The doctor tried to get us 5 minutes, but she won't see us. - May we? - Of course. Once you're better we'll have to question you to hear your story. There's no rush. Take your time to recover. But we'll have to eventually, OK? And we saw your parents. They're outside the door. They're waiting for you to speak to them again. When my father died, it was violent. I was a bit younger than you. My little brother found him. It was an awful shock for us all, but Xavier - that's my little brother's name - completely shut himself off. It wasn't his choice, he couldn't do otherwise. Today he's in a mental institution where he'll probably stay for the rest of his life. I see him whenever I can, but we don't talk any more. Life as you and I know it has left him. You still have a choice. You can either let the guilt eating away at you take over, or you can trust those who love you. You must decide today. Now. Afterwards might be too late. Mr Lanester. Could you please stay for a bit? Delphine went back home. Things should work out now. What about you? What will happen now? Me? Why me? You had a violent reaction to seeing what those girls did to their bodies. It reminded you of your brother. True, I was mad at him when he scratched himself to the point of drawing blood. Now I know he did it to feel alive. He and they had something in common. They would hurt themselves in order to protect themselves. I think it's time I looked at Xavier differently and the two of us made peace. I wanted to say I'm sorry I spoke to you that way. I was an absolute fool. Forgive me. If you can. I won't judge you any more. I'll no longer blame you for being you. And until you open up I'll carry on talking to you about the present, the future and the past. Like when the gull pinched your sandwich. Remember? Subtitles: Eclair Media
