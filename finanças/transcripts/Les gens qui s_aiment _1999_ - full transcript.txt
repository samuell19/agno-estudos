He was leaning on the railing, watching the lights of Marseille recede into the night. He had bought a ferry ticket at random. Destination: as far away as possible. For four years, they had lied to each other and found happiness. Four years of secret rendezvous, of unforgettable, hidden moments, that they had to interrupt, he to rejoin his wife, and her, her husband. Except neither one of them was married. Each had lied, thinking the other was telling the truth. When they found out that both were single, the spell was soon broken. Last week, in Marseille, I met Brigitte. "It's good that he left," she told me. And then, just before leaving, she added: "We're often happier when we're putting on an act!" This has been Enjoy the Ride. I'll be here tomorrow morning for another story of love and adventure, a true story, and one that, of course, you haven't heard before. Take care! OK, I get it. I'll record these three stories Monday afternoon. I'll do my investigation that evening. FRANCE INTER: ENJOY THE RIDE Hello! Angie! It's nice of you to come by. I wanted to! A new coat, nice! -I just bought it. -It's very nice. For the week after, you have two shows that aren't ready. Which ones? The prisoner and his secret marriage? And the girl who walked 50 miles to meet her lover. We need interviews? Julien, you can handle that. I'm already in touch with them. We can record next Tuesday or Wednesday. OK, that works. -Shall we have dinner? -Yeah! I can't, my husband and my son are waiting. Let's have dinner just us. OK. See you tomorrow. I can't do without him! FRANCE INTER: VISITORS I found a father and daughter near Hamburg who are divers. They make a living selling what they find down there. Before that, they ran a brothel. They had so many stories! I have two days with them next week. It'll be a chance to go diving again. -I'm there. Where are you parked? -I sold my car this afternoon. -You sold your car? Why? -On a whim. You sold your car and bought a coat? Look who it is! -What's your name? -Melanie. Leonie. We love your voice! Thanks. -Thank you. -Bye. Bye. Where are we going? Home, honey. I have everything prepared. -As you wish. -Yes. What's up with you? Nothing. I'm great. OK. Great. There's half a lobster each, and some Bandol wine. -Sound good? -Yeah. Do you want to eat here, or in the kitchen? Oh, I don't care. Sit down. I need to talk to you. Are you leaving me? Yes. Again? Again? The last time we broke up was 21 years ago. We were kids. And for the next 20 years, you didn't want to see me. And I did so much in those 20 years. I had two daughters, and two husbands: one Canadian and one German. And as soon as I was a widow, I came back. I'm going to eat. I've seen better Bandols. Thank you. It's not bad, actually. So you're leaving? Are you sure about this? I didn't tell you, but last week, I got rid of everything. I got in touch with a cousin of mine. She lives in Florida. I'm going to open an antiques store there. I'm leaving tomorrow morning. I have my ticket. What did I do wrong? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. When you leave someone, they must have done something. Not me. Why do you always want what you don't have? So I can have it. Eat your lobster. It's very good. You've spoiled my appetite. Look, Angie, if you want to leave, leave. Others can do what they want. I don't care. "Others," that's me. Thanks. I'm sure you're glad I'm leaving. Freedom is sacred to me. The people I love are free. You'll never change. Never! That's a good thing. And besides, you and I are the same. We can't stand living with anyone for long. That's the truth, isn't it? Right? Jean-Fran?ois, we know each other well enough to break up without a fight. My plane leaves tomorrow morning at 10:40. If you don't eat your lobster, I will. I'm going to bed. Goodnight, honey. Need any help? It's fine. I'm leaving you my big travel trunk. I put the clothes I don't wear anymore in it. Everything that's out of style. What am I supposed to do with it? When we got back together a year ago, I rented this house thinking it would be ours. Please, sentimentality isn't your style. You'd found this house before I came back. You said it was perfect for your work, for your peace and quiet. You can still change your mind. Will you stay? My daughter and her husband are picking me up at eight. They're driving me. Thank you. Jean-Fran?ois! We're leaving! Where are you? Remember? I keep everything. It's less sad to leave that way. I'm the one who's sad. He was in the navy when we first met. FIVE YEARS LATER Continuation of notes on Angie, Winnie, Laurent, and our relationships over the years. In the months following Angie's departure for Florida, I received two telegrams asking me to send her, via express mail, a camera and a pair of slippers she had forgotten. I sent them. I put one sugar cube in. Shall I make up your room upstairs? You haven't slept there in a week. Don't worry if I'm gone tomorrow. I'm at a friend's for the weekend. About?one year after Angie left, one afternoon I was working at home on one of my shows. Back then, I was still writing on a typewriter. I heard the sound of a moped. Anyone home? Hello. -Hello. -Is this a bad time? Not at all. I listen to your shows? can I call you Jean-Fran?ois? OK. I love what you do. Making us care about other people's lives. I tell all kinds of stories. Some I make up, but lots of them are true. Sometimes I embellish the characters. Do you write them before, or do you improvise? I write them out, and then I improvise on-air. Do you want to come in? My name's Winnie. I'm Jean-Fran?ois. But you know my mother. I'm Angie's second daughter. Ah? I see. Nice to meet you. How is Angie? I never hear from her. She's still in Florida, in her antiques shop. You left Canada? I've been in France for three months. Mom told me you had an amazing outlook on life. That you always see the best in things. I take the best of what our time has to offer. The rest I forget. You sleep here? Only when I'm working. My bedroom is upstairs. That's me! -Yeah. -And there's Mom. Marie-Helene. Angie sent me photos of you from when you were little. Do you have anything to eat? Sure. So, what did you study? I did my undergrad in the humanities in Montreal, and? another year at the school of fine arts, and another at a school of journalism. But in the end, I decided to become a translator. I like it. I'm independent. I speak four languages. And you're in Paris on vacation? I'm working. I got a job at a daily paper, like News People. I'm covering for a friend of mine who got pregnant. And what do you translate? Foreign-language articles that they bought the rights to. And why did you come to see me? To get to know you. Before leaving that day, she promised to send news. She never did. However, not long after, her mother called me. I didn't know why. After the peeled garlic, the milk. -Creme fraiche. -Coming right up. Gratin dauphinois is my specialty. Hello? Angie! I got your cell number from your voicemail. Where are you? In my apartment, in Longboat Key, over my shop. It's Sunday here. It's Sunday here, too. Winnie came to see me. Yeah, she told me. What's the weather like there? What's the weather like? It rained this morning. It rained this morning? The cheese! You forgot to add the grated Gruyere! -Right! -Come on, ladies! It's really nice here today, it's hot. Tell me more. Tell you what? About your life! Anything new? How's your maid? Her husband went to rehab, and now she drinks twice as much. What about you? How are you? We're at Odile's. Her 25th anniversary is coming up. Oh, congratulations. The nutmeg! You forgot the nutmeg! I'm cooking, of course, since you're not here. I'm hanging up. We're going to fight. It was nice chatting with you. -See you. -See you. You're really trying to ruin this dish. What? What now? Is the oven? No, it's fine. Later, I found out that Winnie had met someone who would be important to her. There was a general strike that day. Can I get in? -Sure! -Thank you. -Oh, no! -Unlucky. GARDEN OF PLANTS -There! -No! Sir! Give me a ride, please, I'll pay you! It's not about money with me. Oh? -Hi. What's your name? -Where are you going? If you don't tell me your name? -Winnie. To Levaillois-Perret. -I'm Laurent, I'm not going anywhere. Hop on! Hold on tight. Put your hands here. There! How is it a girl like you doesn't have a car? I had a moped, but it got stolen. Hold on! I love strike days! Right now, I don't have anyone in my life! Watch the road! Did you hear me? I don't have anyone. OK, what do you want me to do? Well, tell me about yourself! Tell me who you are! I'm a UFO, from another planet. Oh, my dream! What do you do for work? I'm a translator. What about you? I don't have a job. -You're unemployed? -No, no. I don't have a job. See ya. Thank you. Hi. -How did you know when I finished? -I asked around. -Are you hungry? -Yeah. I'll take you out to dinner, and then take you home. -You don't have a job, and you're paying? -I've still got enough. OK, but I'm paying for my half. I love to read. I read anything I can get my hands on. Books are amazing. You read one page, and you're in your own world. You want to write? No, there are enough books out there. You and I are alike. That's dangerous. I should explain how I live. I devote each day of the week to a different activity. Mondays are music. Tuesdays are foreign literature. Wednesdays are French novels. Thursdays are history and biography. Fridays, I go out. Saturdays are for being lazy and dieting. Sundays, I try to do the stuff I don't do during the week. Nice schedule! Do you stick to it? As often as possible. I can see why you don't have a job. What was your job before? Oh! I'll take any job. I don't care. I've worked as a bellhop? Frozen-food deliveryman. A bartender at a swingers club. What else have I done? I've worked as chaperone for kids on vacation. I've even been a private detective. Well, as an intern. And I've just been offered a job as an assistant plumber, starting next Monday. -Do you know anything about plumbing? -Not a thing, but I'll learn. I love to learn. Me too. Two days later, Winnie agreed to a date at his place. This is it. My father was a painter. He painted big military frescos. He and my mother died in a car accident. But this was where he used to work. Thanks to him, I don't have any rent to pay. Honestly, there's nothing better. Laurent? -Laurent? -Oh, shit, I forgot. I told a friend to come by in case? So? How's it going? All good! You can go to the movie without me. Because you thought? Well, yeah, I made a bet. You'd bet him we'd sleep together? He's my best friend. I'm leaving. No, stay! We might have something together. Why not? I think we could. Fine. You have to understand. We meet, we don't know each other, we like each other, we sleep together, but now is when we're going to find out whether the two of us will be something really exceptional. When will I see you again? I don't know. Tomorrow, if you want. Tomorrow I can't. What do you mean, you can't? Hang on? -Sunday I can. -Not until Sunday? "Friday, Christelle, Saturday, Julie". See, I have nothing to hide. Are you kidding me? Let's see each other twice a week. If all goes well, more often. And I thought I'd met someone who was like me. You're the opposite of me. I only love one person at a time. What are you talking about? Hey! Don't leave like this! No, I'm leaving! Call me! A few weeks later, Laurent came to see me. I didn't know him then. Winnie had mentioned me to him. He wanted to sell me stories, for my shows. He was very observant and imaginative. He worked with me on a few shows. -Coffee? -No thanks. We would go to the book market together. I was glad to have found a young person who thought like me. We got along well. -You too? -Yeah. I waste so much time with women. If I could find one who was different? Yeah, of course! When you find her, she slips through your fingers. Maybe it's better that way. Life begins anew every day. Yeah? I got to run. Hang on. I've got a date with an admirer. I've only seen a photo of her. If she's cute, you can go, otherwise, we'll find an excuse. OK? What? -Hello! -Hello. Thanks for meeting me. I'm so happy! I was free tonight. This is a colleague of mine. Laurent. -Nice to meet you. -Likewise. Too young for me! He wanted to meet you, too. I see. Come here, Doudou! Hello Doudou! I've been dreaming of this evening. Are we going to a restaurant? Of course. What else do you want to do? I love your sense of humor! When I tell all my friends about this tomorrow? Oh, I forgot. Is today? Is it Thursday? Yeah. Oh, that's right! We have an eight o'clock meeting tonight! I totally forgot! I'm so sorry? You're leaving? No, but Justine is so nice? Let me finish my drink. Sorry, we've got to go. -It's serious. -OK, I have to go. I'm so sorry! Your dog is so cute. Goodbye, ma'am. -Come on! -OK, hang on. Bye, Doudou! What a man! He really likes you. "Life is a paradise, but we don't want to know it." That'll be the conclusion. It's from Dostoyevsky. Our next show will take us to Scotland. Romance and humor guaranteed. See you tomorrow. Take care. Yes? -Darling? It's Angie. -Where are you? In Paris. I got in three days ago. I was trying to get the money I'm owed. I had no time to call. Are you staying long? I've left Florida. Believe it or not, I unknowingly bought stolen furniture. They charged me with receiving stolen goods. I sold the store and the apartment, paid my debts, and came back here. -For good? -Yes! Hey, I'm waiting for you. See? Whenever I'm in trouble, I always come back to you. Other than you and my daughters, I don't want to see anyone in Paris. -You know what I'd like? -What? To stay at your place for a few days. A few days? No. -What? -Longer. I have lots of plans. I don't know yet. Answer me this. Do you want to live together again? And for it to last a long time? A very long time, even? Of course. You're the only man I found love with again, 20 years later. Isn't that proof? Everything's ready. You rode your motorcycle here, right? Yeah, I got rid of the car. If you could do me a favor, and I'll pay you back as soon as I can, I thought I had money in a bank here. But there's nothing! I only need enough to pay my bill. You'll see how much I've changed. Really? I haven't. We'll try to get along. You don't believe me? I'm not sentimental anymore! -Is that so? -It's over! I'm a new Angie. I want to be like you. That'll be difficult. You sleep out here all alone now? My poor darling! When I'm working, yeah. Come see my room. It's different. These are all the books that have made me happy. Tell me, honestly, why do you love me? Oh, what a nice bracelet! Don't you want to tell me? Sure. I love you because you ask questions. And why do you love me? For the same reasons. You kept my things! This is back in style now. Oh, thank you. Life was once again as it had been. When I'd wake up, sometimes I would sing a tune that had been with me since childhood. My father had taught it to me. I used to always try new recipes when I had people over. No more of that. Now I make the food I like. People talk, argue, they don't pay attention to the food. So I can at least enjoy it. Rabbit with lemon, remember? I used to make it two years ago. Look, this is grandma's house! This is your first time here. Yes, it's different than our place. Slice up the lemons, please. I have some new cookbooks, if you're interested. Inviting my whole family was a good idea, that way we'll be rid of them for a while. You should have opened a restaurant in Florida instead. You're on the wrong side. Take the small staircase up. Hi! We're a little late! Me too! His name is Michel. He's been with Winnie three months. They're always together. -What's he do? -He's a graphic designer, I think. There he is. This is Michel. This is Jean-Fran?ois. -My mom. -Very happy to meet you. Make yourselves at home. Michel was working all night. For new a new packaging design for household appliances. I used to be a surveyor. My degree is in architecture. Then I was a draftsman, because the money was better. We work for the same company. So we're always together! How sweet. Come in. Have a seat. This is my husband, Louis. And this is Auntie Winnie! She's the glory of the family. You've put on weight. Have I put on weight? No, honey, you're just a bit bigger. First to arrive, and always the first to leave. Come back soon with a little sister! Come on! I'm going to take a little nap. -Don't catch cold. -Don't worry. He only slept an hour last night. Winnie, I'd like to talk to you. What say we go for a walk? You and Michel aren't right for each other. A real couple is one where one of you has money. You've really let the grounds go. It's a shame. That all needs clearing, that tree needs to be pruned. Now's the time for it. He lives with you. It should be the other way around. Look, Mom, you love to give advice, but you? What, I'm a screwup? Is that what you think? It's easier to hand out advice than to follow it yourself. Well, I'm giving it. It might prove useful. I have a role model in my life. My mother, your grandmother. She left your grandfather for the owner of a bank. Thanks to her, our family had money for ten years. She gave your grandfather money every month. What a good example she set! I wish I could be like her, but I can't seem to. I thought maybe? -you? -Listen, Mom. Michel and I are broke. We're dying to go skiing in the Alps. If you want to help, lend us money. OK. I'll give you some money. But remember this: every passing day is one less day you have to live. So smile and appreciate it. I appreciate life more than you think. Great. I'm going to take care of your trees. You and I are right to live alone. Family is exhausting. I adore you. What are you doing? I've decided to finish fixing up this barn. Can I help? You can sort the stones. Pick out the best ones. Who's that? Laurent. Remember, he had a thing with Winnie. Were you expecting him? No, but he stops by sometimes. He's very nice. Hello! -Is this a bad time? -Never! This is Angie, my ray of sunshine. -Hello. -Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Likewise. Winnie is pruning our trees. The guy who's sleeping is Jules. I wanted to ask Winnie something. -May I? -Yeah. Hey! Hey. Remember me? Some faces you never forget. No, don't come up! I need to talk to you. -Are you still mad at me? -Not at all. -Are you happy? -Yes. I love a man who loves me. And I love a woman who loves me. And only one. Her name is Marion. She's a businesswoman, a widow. I don't care. Her husband owned these beauty-product stores. He committed suicide, and she inherited them. We need a translator for the stores abroad. -So I thought of you. -Not interested. Think about it. Not interested. Hello? Marion! Yes. I hope you have a wonderful day. I left you a note. I didn't want to wake you. Did you find it? What? What? No, it's nothing, I almost fell. No, I'm not upset. -Why would I be upset? -Get out of here. Go! I can tell we're going to have a wonderful evening. I love our romantic evenings. Yes, I love coming home to you? Winnie is really full of energy. She's always that way. She's an amazing girl. When she loves someone, it's forever. What makes you say that? Experience. Michel. Where's Michel? Are you OK? -Oh, Winnie! -Oh. Get up slowly. Try to walk. You OK? I don't think anything's broken. I thought I might you! Me too. I love Paris at night. I'm going to show you the house where Debussy composed Pell?as et M?lisande. -Yes! -And the last place Maupassant lived. -Yes! -Before he was committed. Let's go. Come on. -Pull over here. -OK. La Belle Otero lived at number 27, and Marcel Pagnol at number 13. I used to only live at night. I know. I'd go to bed at dawn. -I lived there. -Oh, right! On the top floor, a long time ago. This is where Edmond Rostand wrote Cyrano de Bergerac. Just kidding. You know what I'd like? For us to stay in bed for 24 hours making love. Until Monday morning? OK, let's get some provisions and go. -OK? -Yes. Will two bottles of champagne suffice? I grabbed a third. And chocolate and butter cookies. Yes! THREE WEEKS LATER I had a dream we were fighting. I was trying to remember why. It's crazy how you forget dreams. I didn't forget mine. You were a cat. You wanted to be pet, but no more. What's that mean? It means that you and I didn't love each other at the same time. There were entr'actes. You used to disappear for days without a word. I needed oxygen. I used to worry. Like the day you were so worried you waited for me in bed with our neighbor? I forgot. I must have been very worried. You couldn't help it. You loved every woman. You could never choose. And now? What would you criticize now? You're not worried enough. Worry is a part of being happy. You need it. You need anxiety, even. You, you're just happy once and for all. It's my nature. Think of others a little. For them, it's demoralizing. Your turn, now. Do we really have to spell out all our issues? It seemed like you wanted to. I'll see you tonight at seven. We'll make dinner. -See you. -See you. I had dinner with the boss at the station. You were gone for a long time. You could have told me. I waited for you. I didn't have cell service. I ran into an old friend, a friend of my cousin's. She married an Arab prince. Interesting. I asked her for stories about the harems, for my show. You work late. We went to her brother-in-law's. Guess who was there? Three former harem residents. Can you believe it? Not someone you meet every day. Fortunately. One of them had been drinking. I had to wait for her to sober up. The others were very cooperative. One day, you said, "To tell a story, you need a nose for trouble." You've got that. Wake me up in an hour. Wake yourself up. I'm getting up. Jean-Fran?ois? Hi. You know what we're going to do? -What? -Go on vacation. I can't. I have 15 shows to prep. For the new series. Oh! You never go on vacation. Make an exception. I only travel for work. That's my vacation. Listen to me. Last week, I met an Italian count who runs a clothes business in Florence. He invited me to spend a week at his place. You and I could go together. He wants to open a store in France and let me run it. I want to know if the store's good. You don't need me. I'm worried. He might try to sleep with me. I'd feel more comfortable with you there. You'll be fine without me. I've got too much to do. I can't come. All right, then. I'm going to Florence alone. I'll stay three days. I stopped by my bank. I got the money a guy from Chicago owed me. In a few years, you know what we'll do? What? We'll get married. I've never been good at marriages. I don't marry the men I love. I'll convince you. So, yes or no, will you come to Italy with me? No. But come back in three days. Nine months later, Angie was still in Italy. When she first got there, she would call me. She said she'd found heaven on earth, that life was wonderful there. She apologized and swore we'd get back together someday. Before long, she stopped calling. No news from Winnie, either. As for Laurent, whom I saw occasionally, he was going through a rough patch. I'm four francs short. I can give you this one back. It's OK. Keep it. -Keep them all. -No. -Really, it's OK. -Thanks a lot. You're welcome. -Thanks again. -Bye. Laurent! Laurent! I'm glad to see you. -Me too. -Where are you headed? Oh, nowhere, I? I was heading home. Walk with me? I have so much to tell you. What are you doing these days? Nothing. Living. And your girlfriends? None. I doubt that. What was her name, again? -Marion, right? -It's over. She would sleep all day. I was like her minion. You dumped her? No, she left me. But thank God. Now I live alone. There's no one to bother me. I suppose things are going well for you. You and Michel were solid. Oh, no, I left him six months ago. -Why? -He was so boring. I tried to give him a little personality, but I gave up. -So you're single? -No, not at all. I'll tell you all about it. I live here. Sorry, do you have anything to eat? Of course. Come on up. Today's my birthday. Well, it's not very big. -You lived here with Michel? -Yeah. Have a seat. Still no job? I'm fed up with all the odd jobs. What are you going to do? I'm trying to figure that out. Goldfish. What an idea. I won it at a fair, one night, with a friend. I didn't know what to do with them, so I kept them. You used to drink nothing but water. Alphonse gave me them. He's a Burgundy wine merchant. He's in Beaune. He gets back tomorrow. Have you been together long? Two months. Michel and I were on a macrobiotic diet. Now I eat everything, and I feel good. I guess I resemble the men I love. Here, try this. I have a meeting now. Come with me. I'm doing translations for a press agency. The editorial secretary is a friend. She'll find you a job. I need this one for tomorrow night. The other two, for the day after, at 4 PM. I'll walk you out. Should I leave you my number? Winnie will give me it if I need it. -Here. -I'm counting on you. -Excuse me. See you, honey. -Bye. I'll remind her. She'll find you a job. Come celebrate my birthday with us. Where do you want to go? You choose. Take me someplace I never go. Go on! -Want another drink? -Yes. Two more of the same! I love this place. You can do anything. And here, you're never alone. There's always lots of friends. Look, a friend. Charles Cros. "I live life off to the side, crying, even though it's a celebration. People say 'how silly he is.' I'm not well rated. I light a fire in summer. In the factor, I'm a poet. For the fools, I panhandle. What does it matter? I love beauty." When I was kid, in Trois-Rivieres, I used to love Gerard de Nerval. I read the Daughters of Fire over and over. This wine is good. Good body, and at the same time, it's easy drinking. Alphonse taught me everything about wine. He knows it all. He trained for years to drink. He sure can hold it. Tell me, what's not working? Alphonse wants to see me occasionally, but I want to live with him. Yesterday, I told him, "When you get back, give me an answer. I can't go on like this." That sounds just like you! When I love a man, I want him every night. Well? Thanks for the ride. Want a word of advice? Take your cell phone. I imagine Alphonse has an answering machine? Yeah. Leave him a message for when he gets back. Hello? Is that you? No! See you soon. Thank you! It's all thanks to you! I woke him up. He was there. He got back early. He said it was good I called. That we're moving in together tomorrow. Oh! You're good luck! In movies from the '40s, when couples say goodnight, you always wonder whether the girl will let the boy kiss her on the mouth. Yeah, but that happens outside the house where the girl lives. Thank you. -Good luck! -Yeah! The next day, Winnie moved in with Alphonse. The months went by. Sometimes they'd go to Burgundy. As for Laurent, he had finally found a job that suited him. I brought the books you wanted. I can't stay long. I have an interview to go to. You shouldn't have. I'd have come by. I like seeing you at work. Well, here it is. I work like crazy, day and night, but I'm happy with my work. Six months ago, I thought, reading is nice, but it's better to share one's love for books. That has always been my view. Here's where I record, where it's quiet. I've got 42 books on tape now. I mostly choose rare books that aren't well known, but sometimes the classics, too. For copying the audio, a friend of my helps me out. The rest I do myself, from the recording to sending out the tapes. People write to me, which is encouraging. And financially? It's starting to be profitable. My listeners are all ages. I get orders from hospitals, from schools? "I feel emotion only when surprised. I am the first-time man. The joy of surprise. My life's only beauty." Henri Michaux. I'd record some for you, if you want. I'll suggest some books, you pick. That'd be fantastic. It'd be boring if it were always me. OK! See you later. See you soon. Thank you. More notes. Give examples of the weakness of relationships. Those who adore each other and can't live together. Those who don't meet at the right time. Juliette! Juliette! I'm in pain! Call a doctor! Five days in intensive care, a week in this room, It's getting to me. When I came by the first time, you didn't recognize anyone. I've never been good with faces. Don't overdo it. Before my heart attack, I was recording some notes about relationships that fail or who make it. Speaking of, how's Winnie? I haven't seen her in months. I've decided to go away on a trip. Get out of the house. Leave? What for? To enjoy traveling alone. It's going to be great. Places I've never been, cities I don't know. The best trip ever. Ten minutes. That's enough for today. Don't ever overdo it. No. I want to be in shape ASAP. Let's keep going. Be reasonable. Don't overdo it. I've always overdone it. My whole life. That's what I love. Thanks. -Thank you. -Bye. Jean-Fran?ois? I'm so glad you're alive! I've been trying to come, but I couldn't get away. It's so good to see you! Your car's outside. Yes, I saw it. -Are we done? -OK. Same time tomorrow? -Bye. -Bye. -Ma'am. -Bye. This will certainly help my recovery. You have no idea how good Italy was for me. It brought me peace. I don't recognize myself. I'm comfortable with myself. Finally! I have to tell you. I have a clothing store in Bologna. It's doing very well. You're going to come stay with me. I have other plans. I'm putting work on hold. What are you going to do? -A world tour. -A world tour? I'll do it slowly, on merchant ships that only take a few passengers. It's an old dream of mine. You really want to leave? Yeah! Being alone on a cargo ship won't be any fun. Come with me. I can't! I've got my store in Bologna. But I'll stay with you here until you leave. I love you. You too. You're all I have left! Come on. No guy deserves to be cried over. Idiot! Tell me what happened. Alphonse is getting married. He's marrying the daughter of a big winemaker. Jackpot! They got engaged two months ago. I thought it wouldn't last. He kept coming to see me. I thought? he'd see, he'd come back to me. He said, "I'm marrying her because I'm sick of being in debt." -Here. -No, I don't drink anymore. I'm back to water, like before. He's getting married next week. He asked to keep seeing me in secret. Can you believe that? This place has changed. What are those boxes? I record books on tape. And I sell them. It's working out. Do you have a light? Can I stay here tonight? I don't want to go home. This is Patricia, who lives with me. This is Winnie, you remember. I came to tell Laurent my sob story. But? My life is in shambles. I'll leave you. She was living with a guy she adored. He's marrying someone else. You have the same ring? Yeah. We bought them for each other. It was Laurent's idea. Stay for dinner. No, thanks, I'll go. No, you're staying for dinner. I'm not hungry, I can't eat. It helped to come here. I feel less alone. Stay! You can't leave like this. Don't worry. I'm going home. I'll take two anti-depressants, and I'll be fine. Bye, Patricia. Thank you. Thank you. Don't do anything stupid, OK? Don't worry. I'm not going to shoot myself over an asshole like him. Once this is over, I'll be back on form! -Bye, Patricia. -Bye. Bye! Good luck to you both! Winnie! What are you doing tomorrow? -What for? -To talk. I have to take some articles to Bercy. Where we went once? Meet me at the Pourquoi Pas. At six, does that work? OK. Here. I know, I'm 45 minutes late. Hi. -Is there another restaurant? -No. My meeting got pushed back. Everything got messed up. I couldn't call. -You're here. That's what matters. -I can't stay long. Plus it's raining, it's cold. We don't see each other enough. Yesterday, I thought, "Winnie and I are missing our chance." I think we already missed it. There's no use seeing each other. We hurt each other. We're not trying again. Let's go inside. Patricia is a great girl. She loves you. Keep her. You wear the same ring. Patricia is great, I know. But she has a fianc? in Finland. He'll call her one day. So, what? You want me to wait for you? Taxi! Taxi! We can't leave it like this! Yes we can! This is how it ends! I'm sick of missing our chance, let's just go our separate ways! Let's say goodbye once and for all! It's over! Bye bye! I'm sick of you! If we've missed our chance, it's your fault! If you had only trusted me. It's your fault we're here. -All your fault! -My fault? Let me tell you: you never understood me. Never! Let me go! That's it! Go! If we run into each other again, I won't talk to you! I don't know you anymore! I'm not even saying goodbye! It's not worth it! It's me, honey. -Hi, Mom. -Hi. Oh! I was in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd come see you. Make yourself at home. I'm repainting. I see that. Every breakup. It's not that. I used to repaint for them, to make them happy. Michel didn't like blue, so I painted it pink. I didn't have to repaint for Alphonse. I was living with him. It's a good thing I kept this place. Now, I'm repainting for me. I've decided to live a self-centered life. Finally! I'll never love this time period. Me neither, but you make do. Sit down. You still have your goldfish after all this time! They're un-killable, I swear. I don't want more when they die. You get attached. Want some help? Yes. Do you have a smock? -There's stuff over there. -OK. This reminds me of my first room with Jean-Fran?ois. The wallpaper was so ugly that Jean-Fran?ois bought me three cans of pink paint. He watched me do it. He said he didn't know how to paint. Me neither, but I still painted. If only you knew how good it is to be a single woman. Oh, I know! Hello! Is anyone home? Sir? Ma'am? Are you there? Yes, we're in bed. Sorry, I was worried. That's nice, but we're just napping. I didn't buy anything for dinner, since you were going to go out. That's fine, Juliette. See you tomorrow. Thank you! See you tomorrow. I finalized everything at the travel agency today. My ship leaves from Le Havre tomorrow for Halifax. There are only eight passenger cabins. I planned out my whole itinerary. I'm changing ships a few times. I'm going to get organized, too. You'll see. I'll meet you at every stop. When do you get to Halifax? -The 27th. -I'll be there. Where do you want to go for dinner? I don't know. What if we stayed in for once? I was thinking the same thing. We'll figure something out. We'll improvise. Yes. I don't know why, but moments with you? -Are better than ones with other people? -Yes. It's because we know everything about each other. We're accomplices. I feel like we're getting better every year. Took us long enough. The stories I tell on the radio, I take them seriously, but I've never been able to take life seriously. And if you could do it all over? I wouldn't change a thing. Me neither. Still, you were more clear-headed than I was. You were right, when you said we'd missed out on something important. What's done is done. Do you think we could have managed to stand each other? We tried. You've seen the results. I'm going to go get the dessert. -Are you hurt? -I don't know. I'm OK. My heel got caught in the rug. Oh, your knee. You're all scraped up. Let me see. It's fine. I'll go get a Band-Aid. Thanks. -Shit! -Oh no, not you, too. Do you know what my one regret is? What? That Laurent and your daughter didn't get together. They're missing their chance. What can we do? Nothing. Jean-Fran?ois, tell me the truth. You're going on your trip because you know you're sick. You thought, "I'll die someplace random, and no-one will be there." You want to live your life alone up to the very end. I don't plan on dying. I'm leaving to get a change of scenery. Hard situations are wonderful. You question yourself. I'll come back with tons of stories for my shows. And I'll see you at every stop. Don't get up. I'll make breakfast. Last night, I dreamt I was in Shimabara, in the south of Japan, in a teahouse. You came in, and ordered a vodka. You know what we're going to do? Put off going back to Italy. I'll drive you to Le Havre. Wonderful! I adore you! I love you. Jean-Fran?ois? Jean-Fran?ois! Jean-Fran?ois! Jean-Fran?ois! There are musicians out there, what's that about? They're going to play a piece Jean-Fran?ois liked. Jean-Fran?ois wasn't religious. Which is why he needs a religious funeral. He didn't want it to be religious. They're going to play? -Behind the hearse? -All the way to the cemetery. What's she doing? She's been up there over an hour! I'm leaving. I'll be back tomorrow at eight. Madam is flying back to Bologna. Bye. -Bye, Juliette. Thank you. -Bye. In two days, I'm leaving for a trip around the world. Angie and I understand each other better and better. I'll spend the rest of my life with her. I'll meet her somewhere, and we won't ever part again. Why did you stop? No one's dead. Jean-Fran?ois will always be with us. Go on, smile! You've got to smile! Vodka! Jean-Fran?ois' favorite drink when he wants to enjoy himself. This is his glass. Come on, everyone. Yes, everyone drinks. You know what grandmother did, after her banker died, and grandfather two years later? She went to Venice, in memory of her two honeymoons. In Venice, she found a widower who was making the same pilgrimage. He was a jeweler. We're going to go, Mom. The kid? -We can give you a ride. -No, I'm staying with Mom. -Bye, Martin! -Oh, we woke him up. Bye, Martin. Bye. Bye. -So, the Finn came calling? -Yeah. He had priority. LAURENT AND WINNIE A recording about you two. I hope that one day, Winnie and Laurent become one of those couples whom everyone refers to as "the two of them," without ever being able to separate them. They both need to put in work. Let's discuss Laurent's good and bad qualities. Really, you don't want us to stay? I want to spend the rest of the night with him. I'll call you as soon as I get to Bologna! Bye, Mom. We met on the metro, on a bench. That was the beginning of our story. And we won't part ever again. She and I, forever, till the end. Angie, the woman of my life. I love you. And all of you, my contemporaries, you who have lived through the same years as I, and known the hardships and the little things that are the charms of our society, thank you for keeping me company. This is how the authors of Elizabethan theater, which I adore, would finish their final act, by addressing the audience. That's what I'm doing. Thanks to you, my friends, I smiled nearly every day of my life. Don't take these words the wrong way. I have nothing but joy to offer you. Joy lengthens life, and that is what I wish for you. Take care. Subtitle translation by: Adam Lozier
