(light flickering) (engine bursting) (coughing) (light electronic music) - My name is Johannes, and I have a condition. I am human. I first realized that when I fell on my face on a concrete slab on a beach in Italy. I was four, and it was clear to me, beaches cannot be trusted, I hated Italy, and dreams can be broken. The human is a narrative being. We construct emotional machines, so-called stories, to communicate, to share the world in which we live and make it collectively experienceable. And we are pretty good at doing that. Since the primordial soup mendelized into primate brains, we have either been fleeing from big cats or telling others about our escapes from the clutches of big cats. Sitting around a campfire, interpreting and breaking down the world, charging it with meaning, regardless of whether the tales hold up to a Wikipedia check or not. The human is also a political being, although many members of my species don't like that idea. (Wilhelm scream) Get used to it. You can't avoid being political. The moment you choose to buy a sugar free Red Bull at Walmart, you commit a political act. Same is true when you drag a royalty-free hip-hop version of Pachelbel's Canon in D into your shopping basket Politics is the practice of distribution of power and resources within a given community, as well as the interrelationship between communities. Period. (gun firing) We project a certain story onto the world. The story differs if you are leftist, a progressive, or conservative. But be assured, most people I know who call themselves anarchists are just stupid libertarians. We communicate our views by using narrative and conceptual shortcuts. Abbreviated terms like 'freedom' or 'privacy,' and so on. These shortcuts are important. If someone had called 'global warming' something different, let's say 'atmosphere cancer,' we wouldn't have problems explaining why it's a bad thing. I always wanted to create a glossary of all-important terms, because, Jesus fucking McChrist, they are always used and abused in comment sections on the World Wide Web. I wanted to give some of these Golden Calves of Discourse a second look, to explain, re-evaluate, and maybe even sacrifice them. I teamed up with my good friend Ishan Raval, who definitely matches me in my political nerdiness. I mean, look, we both have hands on our chins in our Google profile pics. - [Man] Wahooo! - Pompous little fucks we are. And because I know a lot of creative performers who would do pretty much anything for almost nothing, I decided to make this film. - How much longer do I have to hold this shit? It's heavy. - You can put it in your resume! Come on, a little bit longer. - And we use my car. - You're the head of transportation fleet, okay? So, well, never forget: You don't hate Italy, you hate capitalism. What a big word. So big. Capitalism. (tone beeping) One of the biggest words I know. And I know a lot of words. There's market, too, (tone beeping) but that one sounds a bit too mystical Oh, I think that's Brian Ewok! - [Brian Voiceover] Good to have a comfy seat at my favorite hipster coffee shop and wine bar, enjoying free wifi from a network whose password is Helvetica. I'm just minding my own business when I get spotted by Madame Juju, the friendly hipster coffee shop and wine bar owner who does sweat yoga. - [Juju] Hello, how can I help you? A double eggnog frappuccino with tofu-breaded halibut? - [Brian] There's a sticker for the Green Party candidate behind the bar. - [Juju] Oh, I love the Greens! So friendly, so caring, so cuddly! - [Brian] Marx once called the State a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie. Thank the non-existing God for it, because where management is possible, so also is mismanagement, and some parts of the bourgeoisie, especially those who do sweat yoga and keep their hearts wholesome, might be persuaded to use that committee against their interests. Basically, there are people who own the means of production, let's say fancy coffee machines or servers or farms or server farms. That's the bourgeoisie. And then there are people who don't own the means of production or capital, so they have to sell their work: the workers. That's all the baristas and sandwich artists and RyanAir check-in personnel. But even if the bourgeoisie, which includes Madame Juju, might not be united in its political allegiances, they play the same purpose. It isn't her fault. - [Juju] It isn't my fault! - [Brian] In all corners and cortices of her brain, she might just regard this as her job, an innocent livelihood and even a community service. - [Juju] Oh absolutely! People love me! I am the Maggie Gyllenhaal of saffron-based cale frosting! - [Brian] All of that it might be. But capitalism is bigger than any of our lives and wills. It produces net effects some capitalists don't realize. Madame Juju's heart may not be driven by profit, but her business must be. Money must make more money. More money must be made so that it can keep up with competing coffee shops and wine bars, which are constantly coming up and trying to outperform Madame Juju. - [Juju] It makes me cry! It's not even enough for me to earn back the money I invested. There has to be a good return on investment! - [Brian] Investment? - [Juju] There have to be upgrades to match the latest speedy-spicy-sprinkle trends, or to keep paying an increasing rent so that the coffee doesn't get more expensive, otherwise everyone will go to Monsieur Dudu's down the street! - [Brian] It's true. His coffee is okay, but his wine selection is out of this world! So Madame Juju is forced to cut costs by not protecting the environment, or by paying super-low wages. - [Juju] It is so very sad, but I donate to Amnesty International! - [Brian] Overall, the wealth of the world increases on the side of the capital, be it money uninvested and stagnant-- - [Juju] There are some trillions of dollars around like that today! - [Brian] or the things required for and by business. And wealth decreases on the side of the world where costs are cut, people working for wages and the world itself! Take atmosphere cancer. Sadly, it's not capitalism's side effect, but a sign of its normal functioning. The system was, for the last 100 years, running on cheap oil and making a huge profit with it. Money still needs to make more money, so more and more things have to be exchangeable for money. Everything from gummy bears to DNA sequences to carbon dioxide emissions. - [Juju] But Friedman says that economic freedom is a precondition for political freedom. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Not so fast, Madame Juju! Well, freedom is a huge word too, yes, yes. But in a capitalist society, there's only one freedom, the freedom of the market. (grand orchestral music) - [Brian] At its root, capitalism is based on three simple things. Working for a wage, private ownership or control of the means of production, and production for exchange and profit. And it's all sold with the promise of liberty. - [Juju] But that has been true since the beginning of time! - [Brian] Capitalism didn't arise according to natural laws that stem from human nature, it was spread by organized violence. The concept of private land and means of production might seem like the natural state of things now, however we should remember it is a human concept. First, in places like England, enclosures drove self-sufficient peasants from communal land into the cities to work in factories. Under the reign of Henry VIII alone, 72,000 people were executed for vagabondage. Is that freedom? Later capitalism was spread rapidly and violently around the globe. Do you remember that nice little girl Alice? - [Juju] Oh yes, certainly! Lovely. - [Brian] She fell into Wonderland, used its resources, and was highly judgemental of the natives. A spoiled British imperialist brat. But the Germans weren't much better. - It's the year 1880. Powerful German merchants started to profit from overseas commerce in Asia and Africa. The German Empire supported this expansion by conquering large amounts of land and established so-called 'protectorates.' With fraud, Bible, alcohol, and violence, the German Empire grew to a staggering 2.6 million square kilometers, five times the size of Germany, reaching the third place in colonial power right after England and France. The following sarcastic folk song, written in 1890, has its own perspective on the matter. ("Bibel und Flinte") (light electronic music) - [Juju] But wait, I like black people! They got the rhythm! Equality and justice for everyone! I don't like the super-rich! The middle-class is under attack! The goddamn politicians are to blame! - [Brian] Most liberal-cosmopolitan folks lack faith in public institutions, ideals, and politicians. The notoriety of left-leaning authors, like Michael Moore or (gasping) Noam Chomsky shows that our fellow humans know very well what Moore claims is the awful truth, but they act as if they don't know. We have to realize that everyone is part of the problem. It's our habits, our procedures that keep the game going. There is no good or bad capitalism. Inequality is an integral part of capitalism. Everything, including humans, is treated as mere resource. - [Juju] I like punk rock! I make my own sweaters! I recycle plastic bottles! I enjoy books by Terry Pratchett! I am a Buddhist! - [Brian] That is nice of you, but remember that market driven capitalism musters the quasi-scientific discourses of marketing and public relations, and increasingly, Eastern religion, to recommend products to consumers as necessary means in the liberal pursuit of happiness, self-fulfilment, and personal freedom. - [Johannes] Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it. - [Juju] Well, capitalism has its downsides! But it's way better than communism! That's really bad! It killed people! Even worse, it didn't work. - [Brian] Let us quote Marx himself. - "The categorical imperative "is to overthrow all relations in which man is a debased, "enslaved, forsaken, despicable being." - [Brian] This imperative is true for all conditions, even the ones created by perverted misinterpretations of his writings. State communism killed a ton of people, and the sad truth is that it was based on the principle of a state, it created forms of property, it had banks, police, even a market. State communism was a badly adapted, botched version of the rules of capitalism. We shouldn't shed a tear for it. - [Juju] True! And socialism penalizes high achievers, rewards laziness, cuts freedom, and stifles choice. Ayn Rand says-- - [Brian] Ayn Rand died on welfare! - [Juju] But socialism stifles competition, impeding technological progress! - May I jump in and remark that one of the largest cooperative projects and planned economies was, ironically, the Apollo project to put a middle-class American on the moon. So, let's have a broader look at technology and competition. (grand orchestral music) Aaaaah, I'm at 6 g. Excuse me for a moment. (stertorous breathing) - [Cerebral Cortex] This is Hans Platzgaumer. He enjoys craft beer and gory movies in the Italian tradition. - Oh. - [Cerebral Cortex] And he is a passionate gamer. - Jesus. (grunting) You're going to need some lube and a tow truck to pull my boot out of your ass. (laughing) - [Cerebral Cortex] Do you have a minute to talk about something important? - Huh, where is that voice coming from? - [Cerebral Cortex] I am your cerebral cortex. Listen. - That's weird. - [Cerebral Cortex] Through the dark and not so dark millennia of human history, we have organized ourselves into adversarial cliques, communities, and nations. World events were like deadly ping pong balls hurdling towards us, and these groups were the paddles whose goal it was to knock the ball into someone else's court. - What a crazy-ass metaphor. - [Cerebral Cortex] Add military might as the means to hold in place a lopsided system of distribution, in which workers create more and more economic value for wages that never quite grow at the same rate, and lo, competition became the fabric in which everyday life was dressed. The technology necessary for global cooperation did not exist. (phone ringing) Competition was thus established as the default way of interacting with the world. In its genteel form, competition meant nobody got killed. Gladiators turned to soccer or turned to table tennis. By 1972, computers became advanced enough to simulate competitive games, and PONG was born. - PONG? Woah! - [Cerebral Cortex] Humans are a competitive species, but we shouldn't forget that cooperation and altruism are as much hardwired into our brains. - But what does that have to do with that old school video game? - [Cerebral Cortex] If we don't want the PONG ball to go off the table, we can program the computer to control the paddles better than any human can. Our desire to play competitive PONG versus other humans through obsolete hand operation is nothing but a vain show of one-upmanship. There's no other point to competitive gaming in the computer age. - What the actual fuck! Fuck! FUCK! - [Cerebral Cortex] That's just your limbic system trying to interfere. Pay attention to me! Technology could save us if we'd let it. There is enough material wealth for everyone on the planet to have a sturdy home and a steady food supply, if we stop competing and use our global communication and computation capabilities to level the playing field. - But competition is wonderful! I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass and I'm all out of bubblegum. - [Cerebral Cortex] Competitive systems, such as evolution and capitalism, are terrific at creating unpredictable change very quickly. It's the trial-by-error system. If you're looking for a wide variety of output, competitive systems are the best. Not only will the product of such systems tend to improve over time, they'll fill just about any niche available to them. A competitive system, such as a market, also has its merits as a sensor in approximating what and how much people want. - See, see! It's a good thing! - [Cerebral Cortex] Competition can be a great inspiration to develop skills related to the goal, which is great if inspiration is needed and the skills are useful ones. In a system like PONG however, (glass smashing) you just wind up getting better at playing PONG. A competitive system also is great for ensuring that people who are ahead in the game get exactly what they want when they want it. (rock whistling) A hawk uses highly evolved vision to catch its prey, (phone ringing) and first-worlders use their superior buying power to get iPads. - Hey, hey! Don't speak about Steve Jobs' products in vain! You are making me very angry! - [Cerebral Cortex] Although competitive systems produce good things, such as human beings and diet cola, we also wind up with things, such as wooly mammoths and guided missiles. It's a horribly inefficient way of producing things people need. Most energy in a competitive system is spent not in producing a product, but in staying competitive. In evolution, this waste manifests in a less than desirable cycle of predator-prey adaptation escalation, where more energy is spent surviving than enjoying life. In capitalism, it results in the same sort of relationship, except between those with capital value and those without. People who don't have capital value are trapped working for those who do, and their energy is directed towards keeping their team competitive. - I'm a team player! - [Cerebral Cortex] In our competitive system, (gun firing) most of our energy uses are redundant and wasteful. Redundancy is the result of the wasted overhead when multiple people are working on the same problem in different teams. Team Coke and Team Pepsi are both working on the cola problem, but each spends huge amounts of resources battling the other. Even within a supposedly cooperative society, most businesses exist in order to support other businesses. How much would the production of our essential goods decrease if we laid off our accountants, and all the people who supply computers to them, and all the people who print brochures for the computer salesman, and the people who produce the ink for those brochures, and the people who make packaged food for the truckers who drive those materials around. We have seen a ballooning of what David Graeber calls 'bullshit jobs.' (burping) - Bullshit jobs? - [Cerebral Cortex] Services like financial stuff or telemarketing, even ancillary industries like dog-washers and all-night pizza delivery, exist only because everyone else is spending so much of their time working in all the other ones. In PONG, the fact that your opponent keeps hitting the ball at you means you must spend your resources defending your goal, instead of using your time for more noble endeavors. - That sounds like propaganda! Boring! (record scratching) Can we watch a splatter film instead? (heavy metal music) (grunting) (sinister laughing) Boring, can we listen to propaganda again? (light electronic music) - [Cerebral Cortex] Evolution and capitalism have brought us to the point where it's possible to propel ourselves out of our current state of affairs. Things that used to be competitive games should now be cooperative ones, or not games at all. We have the computational power needed to ensure basic goods are produced and distributed optimally. We can wisely respond to global crises. By breaking market dependency, we could create an economy of complexity, unpredictability and genuine freedom that capitalism has enabled, but also constrained. In the new world, we will be able to relax and let technology do the job. Try it! - I control the ball and it doesn't let me lose! (ball beeping) Awesome! - [Cerebral Cortex] The PONG ball will never fall off the table again! (slow clapping) - A fresh idea, isn't it? So neat, so different, so countercultural! It's the early 19th century. The Catholic township of Oberstetten in Württemberg, now part of Germany, announces to the neighboring commune of Bernloch that the cows of Bernloch will no longer be mounted by the bull of Oberstetten. Bernloch had voted to become protestant. Some creative contemporaries, well... they write a song about the case. ("Schwabenstreich") (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (light electronic music) - [Customer] Hello, I would like to exchange 50 euros to dollars. - [Bank] Okay, here is your receipt. The dollars. - [Customer] Thank you very much. And now, I would like to exchange these to euros. - [Bank] We can cancel that. - [Customer] No. - [Bank] But you'll take a loss on that. - [Customer] Well, that's the nature of things. - [Bank] 44 euros, there you are. - [Customer] Ah, the leftovers. - [Bank] So, this is your 35 dollars. - [Customer] Fine, I'll have these exchanged to euros then. - [Bank] Uh-huh. So, there's the 31.35 for you. - [Customer] I'll exchange them for dollars. - [Bank] Have you got some change left? I need 87 cents. - [Customer] Okay. - [Bank] Okay, you get 27. - [Customer] Well, can you exchange them for euros then? - [Bank] 23 euros 59. - [Customer] Fine by me. All right, let's exchange that for dollars. What will that be? - [Bank] I need 23.50. - [Customer] That was 19, okay. Can I get euros for this, please? And I'll have dollars for that. - [Bank] 11 dollars. - [Customer] I see, fine. In euros please. Thanks. - [Bank] Let's have a look. - [Customer] I'd like these exchanged to dollars. - [Bank] We'll be done in no time now. - [Customer] I'll have these 4 exchanged then, please. - [Bank] 40 cents. - [Customer] You can't change this? - [Bank] No. - [Customer] Okay, I will bid you thanks, then. - [Bank] You're welcome. (cash register ringing) - The worldwide amount of cash, in coins and banknotes, is 20 trillion euros. So, imagine to change that amount, from euros to dollars to euros to dollars, back and forth, back and forth. How many times would it take for fees to eat up all that cash? Well, guess. Here is the formula. We put it into an Excel sheet. And the answer is 849 times, 18 cents remain. And 2 cents get eaten by Microsoft Excel rounding errors. (computer blipping) But Microsoft always gets its fair share. I need a break. (light electronic music) I don't know why I keep returning to coffee shops. I don't even like coffee. I'm a bad Austrian. Well, at least this one is a hipster-free zone. - Waiter! Hello, Herr Walter, I'd like one scandal, please. - Certainly, Frau Schlammpeitzinger. We have a prescription drug scandal, a healthcare scandal, or a corruption scandal. Each topped with whipped cream. - No art scandal? - No, madame. - Oh, what a disappointment! How I would love an art scandal! - That might be a little difficult, madame. We no longer live in the '60s. - Oh please! Just a couple of years ago there was one in Salzburg, the one with the plasticine penis on that horse! And what about Sargnagel! - And that is what madame would consider a proper art scandal? Please! If madame would allow me a remark, the longevity of such a scandal is negligible, on a par with a mere second on Twitter. We'll catch hell from the health department if we serve you something like that. A poor excuse for an art scandal. - Come on. This may be the last time I am in Vienna, and I want my art scandal, like old times, 1968, 'Uniferkelei'... you know, when the Viennese Actionists shat on a desk at the university. Something risqué. I'm an elderly woman and I am used to a certain level of artistic extravagance! - I see, I see. However, if that is what you're after, you'd have to live in a disciplinary society and you're in the wrong place for that. - Would you kindly explain, the last philosopher I read was Habermas in 1975! - Let's explain discipline. In the course of a lifetime, an individual switches from one closed framework of confinement to another, where each one operates according to its own laws, from the family to the school, then to university or factory or the military, from time to time to the hospital and eventually to the quintessential framework of confinement, the prison. The function is always clear, discipline and punishment. - And how does one go about escaping? I can imagine that must be difficult. - It is indeed difficult as you say, but not impossible. Discipline and punishment are certainly effective, yet at least they produce an inner resistance, as well as the possibility to avoid either. It's hard to monitor in absolute terms, and there are always ways of avoiding, if not hacking and ridiculing these mechanisms of control. Let's take work as an example. You hate your boss, he commands you all the time, he doesn't pay you enough, so you look for loopholes and niches like long trips to the toilet, theft of work materials, misuse of hard and software, sick leave, pretending to look busy, playing dumb. - I want my art scandal? - Forgive me, madame, you don't seem to understand. We are not really living in a disciplinary society anymore. The world is changing into a control society. For example, surveillance cameras now have stickers on them that read: "Smile, you are on camera!" It's friendly and embracing! Or, Google created a free augmented reality game called INGRESS that is played and loved by millions of people. The players don't realize that they are actually entering geographical information that Google uses and sells. Google turned expensive, labor-intensive data entry into a game, and now people work for them free, without even knowing. One of the best examples is my old religious studies book from the 1980s. It propagated a responsible treatment of sexuality, instead of the age-old catechistic way. Masturbation was suddenly okay, but you had to do it in a 'responsible' way. Madame, I hope you can understand that it isn't possible to maintain a 'responsible' erection! It was all a perfidious trick to internalize control. - Smiling, playing, masturbating? - The moment a person internalizes the control, making it an integral part of their psychological makeup and their thinking, it becomes absolute. There is no longer anything external to that control. You don't have to be told to behave anymore. You want to behave because you think it's good for you. And it is very hard to subvert yourself. This is especially perfidious for your bread-winning job. Your boss is your friend nowadays, because it makes it easier to exploit you. Workers, now called employees, begin to identify with the corporate identity of the firm itself, resulting in a kind of spiritual share in the company. Did you know that many corporations now have their own anthems? Look, here is the one of Gazprom, performed by Vladimir Tumayev. (light acoustic music) - Neoliberal Russian drinking songs! This is too much! I don't even like rum in my tea! My doctor tells me I don't have much longer to live, and just once more I would love to experience a genuine art scandal! - Where there are distinct boundaries, where there are established social codes, that's where one can effectively take action against them. Where there is a wall, there is a hammer that fits. Cast your mind back. The police once arrested members of the Viennese Actionists for painting with blood or similar things. The outrage, a great word, of the public. Now, if you will consider the context of the 1960s. (tone beeping) A substantial Catholic society living in Austria! Nowadays, if you want to put on a blood-painting performance, you would probably not even come up on the Facebook timeline of a Slovak tourist. - But waiter, that's still no excuse! If one looks for it, one can find a boundary. There are always boundaries. Because look, say I were to grab a pretzel and stick it in my rather old cunt for all to see. I think that's a case in which one might call it a transgression. - Naturally, you could do that. But the boundaries that you are transgressing are arbitrary. And as far as Austria is concerned, and I mean Austria as a social entity, I think it couldn't care less. (siren wailing) - I am fading! - Calm down, madame, drink a glass of water! A scandal must involve an outrage in the sense of a moral and passionate response. In a world of micro-societies and niche capital, it is hard to hold a mirror to society. - But waiter, that would be horrible! - Madame, you are right. But I refer you to an ORF interview with the German hip-hop maverick Jan Delay, where he says that he wouldn't think twice about calling the Pope gay, but mocking Islam is something he would never do, out of too much respect. What a coward! - In other words, as long as people have boundaries of respect, there will be scandals? - Yes, more or less. But these boundaries of respect are becoming progressively smaller and smaller. - Punk is dead. - So what am I to do? - Simply seek out a new geographical focus for your life. - You're saying I should leave beautiful Austria? - Don't get nostalgic! There would be no Ai Weiwei without the wonderfully disciplined People's Republic of China. And Iran is also pretty. By all accounts, the weather there is idyllic and every day people are offed because of their, for example their views and their sexual orientation. - Thank you! Then I think I'll give the menu another glance. - As madame wishes. Call me when you've selected something to your liking. - Waiter. - Yes, madame! - Could you at least give me the recipe for a real art scandal. I'm just a nostalgic type of person. - I'm sorry, but our old cook passed away the year before last. However, I could bring you an event, and some say you can't even taste the difference. (light electronic music) - [Woman] Oh, it's a birth simulator! - [Young Woman] I blame society for Zack Snyder's career. - In 1914, the German Empire declared war against Russia and France, effectively starting World War I. The elite wanted a German Reich from Brittany to Saint Petersburg. A lot of walking for simple soldiers. ("Das Schleppen ist des Landsers Last") ♪ (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (light synth music) - [Johannes] How can this be the future? That's not what Blade Runner promised me! (electronic blipping) - [TV Host] Global communication is organized and institutionalized by interconnected machines that we call the media. Satellite dishes, YouTube channels, SnapChat, the Guardian, the Onion, Tinder, you get the point. - [Pundit] I would emphasize the fiber-optic cables that traverse the whole globe, not only holding together the current information economy, but scrambling our system of nation-states! - [TV Host] Such a smart-ass (laser zapping) - [Pundit] Aaaaah! Ouch! - [TV Host] Bottom-line, media is the strongest political, economic, and heuristic power in the modern world. Media is always owned. I own some, you own some, but most of it is owned by, well, someone else. - [Johannes] Recently, I asked my friend David Fine to do a research study on his lunch break. His results suggested 35% of the media is owned by Mark Zuckerberg. I first offered him 25 euros if he could find that it's actually 45%, but he said nobody would believe that. We agreed on 35% for 20 euros. David Fine completed his study in under two minutes. Five stars. Would buy again. - [TV Host] You see, it's redundant to talk about fake news, because news is by definition fake. Ask the constructivist. - [Correspondent] That's right! - [TV Host] News is fake because it is created and edited in a specific way, for a specific target group, for a specific purpose. The idea of freedom of the press and journalistic objectivity is strange in a world so obviously based on power relationships. (bell dinging) Facts used to be a driving force and selling point of journalism. But research is expensive and market forces don't care if you sell something because it's researched well or faked well. - [Activist] Free speech, free speech, free speech. - [TV Host] Freeze peach? - [Activist] Free speech, free speech, free speech. - [TV Host] Shut your piehole! Who or what do people imagine delivers the right to free speech? The question should not be, do you believe in free speech? The question should be, who in our bourgeois democracy really has free speech? Defending the free speech of Nazis doesn't guarantee the free speech of anti-fascists. The content of speech, or any right to it, isn't what's important. The provision of labor power and social inclusion determines the affordance anyone's speech is given. - [Pundit] But that means we have to uphold the ideal of free speech for all, otherwise the bourgeois state and forces of domination have an excuse to-- - [TV Host] Smart-ass again. (laser zapping) - [Pundit] Ouch! - [TV Host] Let's not act as if we live in a world where everyone has the same free speech. There was no freedom of speech in Eastern Germany, yet there were very active communication channels, pamphlets, and discussions, all beneath the radar of the state. The open media world of liberal societies always encouraged free-ish speech, but in a way of calming down dissent. - [Pundit] But comedy functions as an important-- (laser zapping) - [Pundit] Ouch! Goddamn it! - [TV Host] The oh-so-wonderful heroes of liberals, the comedians and satirists, never really changed anything. A naked emperor is still an emperor. - [Activist] Free speech, free speech, free speech! We are a free society! You can say whatever you want, whenever you want, on whatever channels you want! - [TV Host] Sure. But it's irrelevant, and we all know it. How can we find a way to communicate when no one wants to listen? The totality and power of the media is an ongoing negotiation. Normality and reality are created within its structure. To attack normality and reality would also mean to attack this structure, something folks have referred to as the semiotics of reality or social semiotics. - [Stefanie] Have you heard about the Bechdel test? - [Katharina] No, what's that? - [Stefanie] It's a test for movies. A movie has to have at least two women in it, who talk to each other about something besides a man. - [Katharina] Oh, I see. So this film passes the test now. - [Stefanie] Yes, we are the token conversation. - [Katharina] Oh, that's very nice then. - [TV Host] It's important to analyze how something is represented, and what is not represented or how it lacks representation. It's not Zuckerberg, whose assholishness is not in dispute, we should attack, but rather the cultural grammar of the public space. Power is formed within such a grammar. Access and non-access to everything is regulated in its realm. Meanings are negotiated there. Good and evil are determined. It is a common reflex for people to think they are helpless against almighty governments and corporate powers. But power is more like an icky jellyfish than a solid brick wall. Play with it! - [Pundit] Y-y-yes, madame! - [TV Host] That's how I like my pundits. (calm piano music) (ducks chirping) (dogs barking) We live in a paradoxical world. The largest phone providers own no telco infrastructure, the most popular media owner creates no content, world's largest media house owns no cinema, the largest software vendors create no apps, and so on. - [Wizard] What is this sorcery? - [TV Host] Yet, we obviously live in a highly material world. Our freedom of yada-yada-yada seems a bit sketchy when you consider that all our lovely 'Pepe the Frog' fan blogs and anarcho-syndicalist forums would be gone in a heartbeat if just one company decides to shut down their itsy-bitsy-teeny-weeny-yellow-polka-deep-sea cable. Or imagine if our home country wants to pull an Egypt or Turkey on us. - [Teknomator] I know now why you cry. But it's something I can never do. - [TV Host] Prost! There is no freedom of information until, let's put it in simple terms, you can download your hardware. Not gonna happen. Even the wonderful DIY revolution can't change that. All our hacker gadgets and Arduinos and Linux notebooks are made from the same raw materials as the corporate hardware, mined under horrific conditions by 21st century slaves, assembled by folks with a similar fate. Here is a crazy, yet strangely compelling piece of music, first presented at the German Evangelical Church Assembly in 1975. A mixture of Christian revival attitude and left-leaning agitprop. Quite something, isn't it, Pontius? ("Du kleine Löterin") - [Johannes] I am useless as an artist. There is nothing left to do. Oh, a video filter that makes videos look like they are really old. This changes everything. (light guitar music) (tone beeping) - [Narrator] Hey, you. Yeah, you. What? Is someone there, you're asking? Someone watching you? Of course there is. But don't be scared. You are my big brother, the modern subject. I know you haven't known me personally, since our parents, Father Honor and Mother Concern, sent you away to the Boarding School of Bourgeois Privacy when you were young. But those years of your life are over. I am here to pick you up and guide you into a new tomorrow! Let me give you a hug! No? You miss Bourgeois Privacy? My, my! Don't cry! You say your liberty was protected in there? You felt safe having a personal space that felt hidden from outside curiosities, views, and disapproval? You don't understand, big brother! The privacy you've had so far is a historical contingency, not a universal fact. You can't stay in school forever. It's a stage in the life of a subject like you. See, privacy, as we think of it, is only 300 years old. It doesn't exist in its precise Western bourgeois form in Eastern cultures. But as common goods came to be held in few hands, creating separate private and public spheres, an ever more tightly defined family protected itself and its wealth against the street, against the remaining population. Bourgeois mores of propriety, depending upon an infrastructure of privacy, served to legitimize the bourgeoisie against other classes. The bourgeoisie often defined its moral superiority over the masses of workers through the latter's lack of proper privacy, although the workers simply couldn't afford adequate living conditions. - Heinrich Heine wrote this lovely revolutionary ditty just a couple of weeks after the uprising of the weavers of Langenbielau and Peterswaldau in Silesia in 1844. ("Die schlesischen Weber") (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) - [Narrator] They were weaving and weaving, and their bosses had money, spare time and privacy. But privacy was already being undermined! The technological advances toward the end of the 19th century were discussed just as much as today's are. The telephone was dangerous for opening the home's safe space to faraway ears. X-rays were a weapon to peek beyond walls into the most private quarters. (sighing) Calls for strong laws to protect privacy against such threats emerged, most famously in the 1890 essay The Right to Privacy, which is still prevalent in privacy legislation debates. The problems were not limited to the intrusions into individuals' lives. Disrespect the line between public and private, and you set poor moral examples and degenerate proper public discourse. For example, the authors warned against newspaper stories leading to improper public discussions of private matters. Such stories could matter to the demos, and become a matter of politics. Hmmm. In the 20th Century, liberal democracies promoted privacy as a liberal counter against populist doctrines, be they communist or fascist. This period was also when the welfare capitalism of liberal democracies, through their surpluses from colonialism or imperialism, raised the living standards of most of their populace. The so-called middle class had privacy, too. But these very economic conditions enabled marginalized parts of bourgeois society to think about the good and the bad of privacy. Feminist activists used drastic publicity tactics to start discussions of issues formerly hidden by privacy and taboo. For example, in France and Germany, they started public mass confessions involving prominent women, stating: "We had abortions." Similar tactics were used by homosexual activists. Oh, I got carried away. What did you say, big brother? Oh, it's not all bad. Especially for marginalized groups, it is useful to have space free from authoritarian eyes. But privacy is under attack. This time, the troubles might be terminal, along with probably so many other troubles of bourgeois political economy. Dear big brother, put in your earbuds! Here is an interesting song from the 1970s. It's called 'Die Nummer' by Info Music Bamberg. This song is a great example of middle-class angst ♪ At the dawning of the age of computerus ♪ Sorry, just listen to the song. ♪ (singing in foreign language) - [Narrator] Our lives are being rewired to form one global infrastructure that works on the basis of our information. (chickens clucking) Privacy is not under attack by some evil outside forces. It's under attack by our own collective behavior. These trends could be stopped only by massive efforts. People wouldn't be able to share stuff online! - Mongolian barbecue is neither Mongolian nor barbecue. - [Narrator] We would have to get rid of the Internet as we know it. But you don't want to do that, right? You'd make the right choice, wouldn't you, big brother? You wouldn't sacrifice memes and porn for bourgeois privacy, right? Our information is out there. It's not by choice. It's a necessary entanglement, and it's adding up to something big and beautiful, presupposing we take the right actions. If nice things are being made on the basis of mass data collection and utilization, we should have those things. The problem isn't data. It's the power relations that lie behind the data and its use. Our liberty depends on factors other than the secrecy of our actions. You wouldn't hide your weed from Father Honor and Mother Concern if they didn't still have some power over you, right? Institutions might be forced into greater efficiency and honesty if all corruption were to leak out. Actually, this process is already starting. Think of WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden. - There is a cool game. It's called 'Don't Think About Julian Assange Molesting a Chicken.' You lost. - I got the weirdest boner. (rooster crowing) - [Narrator] A democratization of surveillance would allow it to be turned against the powerful. Post-privacy will be difficult, though, if the playing field isn't level, if information is released but the same groups have the power. But if we hold the information, if we decide how it's used, given how important it is to everything that happens today, we can settle historical power imbalances. See, I'm not the state, or Wall Street, or the servers of Silicon Valley. I'm Little Brother. I own no means of production, except all the information I have about you and your friends. What we need today is a network, platform, or some equivalent institution of Little Brothers like me, who have no monopoly over violence, power over your credit rating, or ownership of your debt. My sole power rests on having all this data. But I'm not alienated from you. I'm on your side! So let's attack the forces that make us fear for the loss of privacy at their roots, because we have the core productive force of the day in our hands. We can take these forces on together! (computer blipping) (light electronic music) - [Johannes] I once met a pansexual German paratrooper who thought Michael Haneke is totally overrated. Clever fellow. He invited me to check out Vienna's Museum of Natural History. I joined him and he told me an interesting story. In 1952, Austrian big-game hunter and Africa 'researcher' Ernst Zwilling, a colonial revisionist and member of the Nazi party, brought a male chimpanzee from Cameroon to Schönbrunn, the Viennese zoo. In his African home, Honzo had reportedly been a friendly and likeable animal, but in the zoo he began to show a violent temper. Due to his choleric outbreaks, poor Honzo was kept in solitary confinement. The chimpanzee was given beer and cigarettes. He got addicted and died an alcoholic and chain smoker. After his death, the chimp was taxidermied and put into the Museum of Natural History. Now people from all over the world stare at him. That's gotta be an allegory of something. (tone beeping) - Hello, Politics! Your reputation precedes you. - It has been a wild few millennia, but, these days-- - My God, what happened to your voice, the fabled vox populi? - Yes, that's why I'm here. I'm not sure, frankly, who I am! - But you are Politics! - Yes, but who am I really? I mean listen to this voice! And I feel different! It's not just aging, it's a different existence. Maybe I'm dying. - Now, no hasty conclusions. Let's start with what we can see. This voice, who's voice is it? What is the subject, the subject of Politics? - Well, I've been talking to my family. They tell me I've changed. They're worried about me. They say I'm getting carried away by the whims of the age, not representing what I have in the past. But I can't tell. I'm just going with the flow. - What do you mean going with the flow? Who are you speaking for? - That's the confusion! One moment I speak for women, another for men, another for genderqueer people. The next day I get called TERFy, and then I speak for trans people, then black people, then white people. Kids these days treat me like God, as if I can solve all their problems. Now I see how God feels, responding to prayers all the time. - Wait. You don't speak for the people? - That's what my friend Philosophy keeps telling me to do, but Neil deGrasse Tyson said philosophy is a distraction, and Neil's a person-of-color, a voice that has been historically sidelined, so-- - Hmm, no wonder the vox populi is damaged. Right now, yours is the vox grex! But you're still Politics? - I'm not sure! - Well, tell me what you do to represent your subject. - Well, right before I came here, I was a Tumblr post that said 'Writing class notes in glitter pen is nonbinary culture.' Just before that, I banned Halloween at an elementary school, since Halloween isn't inclusive and can be awkward for some children. Before that, I was in alt-right incel form, saying I'd rather stick a razor up my ass than share a planet with women. I spent all last night as J. K. Rowling, arguing as an enlightened radical centrist against Corbynites. Yesterday, I was on Twitter, calling out Chelsea Manning for advocating NO BORDERS. I've been Richard Spencer a lot, saying the U.S. should be a safe space for people of European descent! I don't know who I am at all. - Let's see, what does all this have in common? You're working against double standards, ensuring people get fair treatment. Isn't that good? More important, isn't that what you've always done? - Yes, but you know what my friend History says? - What? - He says it's different now. He says that in the past, say with anti-colonial struggles like the Haitian Revolution, advocacy for the disenfranchised was on the basis of their belonging to a broader category, like human, hmm, I haven't heard that word in a long time. Sounds weird, doesn't it? Anyway, History says movements, like Civil Rights or feminism, that addressed the needs of specific groups in the last century were about social structure. Now, I'm about the recognition of an individual or group's identity. Everyone from Fred Hampton to Martin Luther King Jr. to Shulamith Firestone, according to History, incorporated a critique of systems affecting more than the group they fought for. Or they called upon a unifying subjectivity among us to overcome systems that affected different people differently. Philosophy backed all this up. Of course, categories have been created to ensure some people dominate more than others, Philosophy said, and we must fight for the marginalized. But the cries of the oppressed are liberatory only insofar as they echo a universal dimension, revealing a wrong in society, be that about sexual difference, resource distribution, or anything else. - But now, it's for its own sake? You affirm and celebrate, say, brown people, not because they are part of something larger, unfixed, and uncontainable, but because they are brown! - I... think... so. - But is being brown anything special? - Who knows? Ask the subject that comprises me. - Oh, but is there 'a' general subject there? - What do you mean? - I mean, Politics, you arose in the interaction between the particular and the universal. The particular, a human being, was championed, because it's part of a universal, the human being. When you become about people because they belong to a static group, neglecting those groups are social constructs, you realize that you can also be co-opted for bad stuff, right? - What do you mean? I am justice. I weigh society with a blindfold. - You were just saying you took the guise of the alt-right. That's politics today. See, talking about unfair treatment of people, but basing the conversation on those people's' subjective identity category opens you up to be used for reactionary politics and fluff politics. Like Hillary Clinton's 1.2 billion dollar campaign in 2016, which was mostly about deserving power because she isn't a fuckin' white guy. When you become about groups in society and lose sight of society itself, you pose no threat to the institutions and structure of society, which aren't mere constructs. That's why your disconnection from universal concerns is popular among conservatives. In fact, advocating on behalf of subjective groups rather than the common good, which includes marginalized people, began with the counter-Enlightenment right of the 18th Century. Against universal human values, French arch-reactionary, Joseph de Maistre wrote, - "There is no such thing as Man. "I have seen Frenchmen, Italians, and Russians. "As for Man, I have never come across him anywhere." - Today we need not only justice, but liberté, egalité, and covfefe, I mean, Justice! - Yes, my friend Media Theorist used that hallowed value, Covfefe, to explain what's wrong with me. But what does this bode for my health? Can I survive this? - Survive? Sure. In fact, you'll regress to when you were younger and different groups considered themselves special for no good reason. You must realize, if the subject that speaks through you doesn't speak for the common good, it advocates for inequality. - How can I be for the common good again? - Oh, I'm no expert on that! But I know my Greek, and you need a polis. A stable, geographically concentrated community with various social identities united by economy has been a historical precondition for you. But our geographies are being scrambled by the internet and its microcultures, and our economy is being dispersed by the same forces. Can Politics exist without a polis? - Sounds like something my friend Literature says. - What? - She says that the people, wow, that sounds weird, too, was a social form that existed in relation to a mode of society. The individual was also a construct of this bourgeois society. Forces of production are rendering these constructs obsolete. Real entities still exist, but no symbolic regime remains to address them. So I am stuck between the concrete or particular real, and the abstract or universal real, throwing darts at meaningless approximations. - The means of modernity are inadequate, especially remembering your unfortunate appearance as 20th Century state socialism. So, my diagnosis is, and that will be 250 dollars, you're confused because you're constantly shifting form, but that form is always restricted. You want to include the universal, but since the worker's movement died, such politics, I'm sorry, I have NO treatment. - You don't think my voice can be that of the universal? Must I, must I only be about what happens between groups? What about, (record scratching) what about... Bernie didn't die for this! Where's the bathroom? - [Psychiatrist] Occupied by Occupy Bathroom. - [Politics] Fuck! - [Johannes] Das Lied der Arbeit, the song of work, was first presented to the world in 1868. It is the official anthem of Austrian Social Democracy. And I say to thee, what the fuckedy fuck! It's such a horrendous fetishization of work, I want to puke and build a factory out of it. Let's listen to an interpretation by Mira Sophia Ulz from 2009. Mira won the Austrian Kiddy Contest, a song contest for young singers, and so the social democrats invited her to celebrate with them. Not sure she deserved that. I asked wobblersound to create a proper remix. ("Das Lied der Arbeit") (crowd applauding) (laughing) - [Johannes] Mmmm. (Jean-Claude firing gun) Democracy, mmmmm. One ruling form that rules them all. The young adult novel of governmental systems. It doesn't work, but people still go with it. Every couple of years we vote for our representatives, yet the rest of our lives is very undemocratic. Work life is no democracy, sports aren't democratic, art isn't democratic. And, just as a nudge, imagine NASA is planning a mission to Mars. Do you believe a democratic process would determine who goes on that mission? They won't waste billions of dollars sending unqualified personnel, they will peer-fuckin-review it! The question is, why do we use democracy to run nations? The answer, you might imagine, is, if you believe you have power, you don't challenge power. Let's have a look at a specific subgenre of democracy. Social democracy. It is 1926. Erich Mühsam dedicates the lyrics of the upcoming song to the leading cadre of the German Social Democratic movement, because they are constantly collaborating with police, justice, military, and administration. The Social Democrats were thus supporting and perpetuating the societal order of the German Empire. Nuff said. ("War einmal ein Revoluzzer") ♪ - [Johannes] Maybe Social Democracy learned from its failures? (grand orchestral music) Let's visit a meeting in the nation of Sirkennethbranaghkhgkia, a state that owes its name to lack of creativity. - Anyways, the newly elected President Ödem von Horvath sits at his desk, two advisors beside him, biological male and biological female. - Do hope the warm water is working soon. - I am sure it will be, Mr. President. - Okay, so what's on the agenda? - We promised free healthcare, free education, wage increases, two months paid vacation, strong housing and transportation programs, and more. - Superb, shouldn't be a problem, right? Just tax the rich! (harp music) - Well, to do that, we must first have a robust economy, with a thriving private sector that enjoys production and market advantages over the economies of other nations. - Ah, is that so? - Let's model it out. ♪ Hallelujah ♪ - So, more for us. This is how, right? More for our companies in market share and profits? - [Biological Female] Yes. - Why isn't it working? - I can't say. In the 1950s and '60s-- - You mean the Golden Age of Capitalism? - Oh, yes. - But to go on, then, it was easy. Other world economies weren't as good. Our firms could easily out-compete them. But in the 1970s, the rest of the world started to catch up and needed increased money supply, so the system of fixed exchange rates around the dollar was gutted. Increases in oil prices destabIlized the system further, and companies struggling against national competitions withdrew from their compromise with labor. I don't know what we could do now, though. - Hmm. Aha, I've got an idea! We could put a pump in the other parts of this-- - Congealed labor, it is. Very precious. - Congealed labor is the amount of labor intangibly present in a commodity, which in the market is roughly expressed as exchange value or price. - Marvel of capitalism, really. Allows innovators such as ourselves to model the world, before it is directly lived, as an accumulation of representations. - Yes, very good. We can put a pump in congealed labor that isn't ours. And we can just throw away some congealed labor from other parts of the world. - Excellent idea, just make sure what we do doesn't seem like colonialism or imperialism. That really alienates those millennials from our party. - Of course, and it's clear how it can be done! I'll call China, and India, and all the other countries, and bid them, in the name of international cooperation, to funnel their congealed labor to us and to become bad at doing global economy! - That probably won't work. - Yeah, no, Mr. Xiaoping and the Communist Party of China are very committed to the ethos of the treaty of Nanjing. (sighing) They feel they must uphold uncompromising free trade. - And Mr. Modi, we've been trying to get in touch with him all day, but his phone is always in airplane mode. - Then how are we supposed to strengthen our economy? - Discipline and social hierarchies! We can make our consumers buy our goods if we return to the production paradigm of the 1950s. White men get paychecks, granting a certain standard of living to their families, in return for not only work, but society itself being factory-like! No unruly behavior, so women back in the semi-automated kitchen, please! - Oh, this isn't working! They're protesting against assembly-line production norms and not working hard at all. They've become used to the flexibility and autonomy they have, limited as they are. - Oh, damn it all, I'm just going to tax the rich! (harp music) They'll cough it up! Here, let me text them!

(phone dialing) - Bad news, Mr. President. - Well, we got the money to solve the problem now! - Maybe not. See, the industrialists, venture capitalists, tech CEOs, and bankers have all moved more capital to places with lower taxes than what you're proposing. They've invested more money in artificial intelligence, so they don't have to pay living wages! - Anyway, people were spending their increased wages on cheap foreign goods. And with our domestic companies in overcapacity, investors are speculating in risky tech and finance. Then they can then move even more, even more assets away from us! - [President] How could they? - They could do whatever they want. They, they, they, - [Both] They still own the means of production. (crowd laughing and applauding) - The following song is a parody of the Horst-Wessel-Lied, the anthem of the German Nazi Party from 1930 to 1945. It was sung at every fucking occasion, but during the Third Reich the song was parodied in underground versions, poking fun at the corruption of the Nazi elite. Well, there are similarities between different texts as underground authors developed them with variations. But here is my favorite.
