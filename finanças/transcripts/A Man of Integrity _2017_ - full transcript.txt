- What is this about ? - You got watermelon, it seems? - So what, is it a crime? - It depends. Tell your father that I'm legit. It's the mosque that sent me. Nothing to do with my father. The license ? - Expired. - I'll renew it. You come get it in the mosque. Sorry, we could not talk to the bank. You can pay how much there? The nothing. I need a small advance. There is no point in hesitating! That's all beneficial. It will be half as much as the accumulated penalties. And I can postpone the two-month deadline. There, it will be the New Year, business will resume, you will sell your fish, you repay it to the bank and we don't talk any more. It's not for my apple, that money. There is the branch manager, his right arm, Regional Director ... Each takes his share. Okay. I bring it tomorrow. Today would have been better. One day premium less. Don't change your mind, or you'll sink. Come back tomorrow. It really sucks in all subjects. Once, he asked to go pee. He had money on him. He had an idea and he did what he wanted. The little fish said, "Mom, I have to go." His mother asked: "But where are you going so early?" Do not worry. You're healthy, thank you God. The money, all right, it's coming. You can always adjust. You're young, you're going to work. You'll regain what you lost. Do what you think is right. Sahand ! In the pick-up. The pick-up ? Yes, why not ? Here, Reza. You need anything? Non. Goodbye. That's my last offer. I want the money immediately. It takes a week to sell ... I gave you the market price. But if you lower to 300,000, I'll buy, there, in cash. 300 000 ? I need money. Like everyone. I have to win there too, me. It is an hour to come? We are closing. - We're in the car. - I have no more. What do you mean ? We can not talk here. We will do it in mine. Thank you so much. It's too much. I changed my mind. I pay the penalties. Are you kidding me ? I've already talked to management. Sorry. I can not. I thought you were in need. I am. But I do not want to get out like that. You do not want to get you out at all, it seems. You're in trouble and you're quibbling for a tip. You may be afraid? What? Do not worry, no one will know anything. I am not afraid. I do not pay bribes. If it's like that.Â¦ Here, keep this. Come on! Go pay your penalties before it closes. I'm going to. POLICE STATION How do you go to school with a disruptive element that fight? You punish. He was given a warning. We did it. It is not the first time. My husband is a quiet man. They had to push to the end. There are laws in this country. You can not beat people to death with impunity. The law should apply to all. It's the case. But it's not that bad. He will be detained tonight. He will see a judge tomorrow. Asghari ! Take Mrs. see her husband. 5 minutes. Visit. Here, a change of clothes. Why do you think you are to Abbas? This is a jerk. Leave him alone. We fought. It happens. Low Mass will begin at school. I'll pay the fine, we do talk more. In the morning, before leaving, check the pool water. To be sure they have not cut off. And if they cut off, what do I do? It's over ! I will come to court tomorrow. Wait. I'd rather not. I will do it by myself. Okay. Goodbye. Returns. - Yes ? - I need a letter. What kind of letter? A letter from the Commission saying that the company took our water. The Council does not interfere with private business. The water sector is private? The Company distributes as he pleases. Of course, water is not a private matter. But the Council has not mandated to set your husband alone! You are not going to support it? I just tell you, it does not interfere in private disputes. This is not private! They make their own law. Do you have a solution ? You can write that their vandalism harm the water supply. Listening, we do not want problems with these people. Good advice: go back to your school. - Have you finished, dear? - Almost. Your dinner is ready. Look! What do you have ? - Why you release and not me? - It's looking at you? You better shut up. Otherwise, it puts you out naked, that thou thee the frozen overnight. Go away. Standing. Your hands. What did I do ? Asghari! Do not forget the minutes. At your service ! Both are on bail. A caution ? I want to see the judge. You have already spoken and the judge read the PV - Why you want to see? - PV What? They bought the cops. I was handcuffed like a murderer! It is better for you that a judge can not hear you. There are not yet had a trial. Call your family for the deposit. Once released, you can talk to the judge promised. There is no judgment. I want to see the judge, but I was told to expect. But here you have to pay a deposit. I do not know. Hold on. Please. Will my wife's payslip be okay? She is a civil servant. A deed of property worth more than 50 million before the office closes. They want a 50 million deed. Ours, it will not work. There mortgage. I'll manage. But we only have 2 hours. Okay see you later. Ms. Darai is requested at the office. I have an emergency, I must go. But you had to see the mother of a student. - Which ? - One that is returned. Call her and arranges it for me. I will see tomorrow. Heard. See you later. - Sir! - It's closed ! - But it is not 14:30! - It's closed. But why ? This is 13: 30 pm. - My husband is in there, I act. - Tomorrow! My husband is there, I tell you! He was transferred to prison. The prison ? He did not do anything ! Open to me! I can do nothing and no one. Come back tomorrow. I can not wait for 3 days! He should not have committed a crime. Who says he has committed? I'm doing my job. 3 days of investigation and 3 days for the report! Why is it so long? You can not speed up a little? One week! One week ? To do what ? I want to see your supervisor. His office is on the first. Hadith! Attends ! Reza is stuck. You believe help like that? Give me that. Go wait in the car. It is all good. It addresses the priority issue. It comes tomorrow at 9 am and after 30, we talk about it no more. How did you do ? In your opinion ? Here you are again. It is all good ? Non. There is still that night. But why ? I do not know, the paperwork. What's new here? The mother of the student is coming. Which student? The one you had to see. The little that was returned. You have spoken to him ? No, I prefer it to be you. You could do it ... To say what? Poor woman, she was in a state ... She knew ? To cry like that, she had to know everything. In addition, it is so serious, his daughter ... I'm sorry for that mother. I really wish I could help. How? An advertisement in the newspaper would probably do. An announcement of what? To deny their religion. I guess she does not want that. It's not much to do, for his daughter ... Pass me the casebook. No bribe, one could always run. And it must be that they make their living. They have no official salary. Reza would never have paid. Even if I had been in prison. He will learn. When ? Life takes care of it. Some learn quickly, others slow. Some learn too much, others too little. "He was angry and "was angry" in two words. "And began to scream." "This encouraged other "To avoid ..." Continue, I'm coming. Hello Madam. Sorry to bother you. I am the mother of Ziba, your student. Of course, please. You asked to see me, but you were absent yesterday. Your assistant told me that I had to talk to you. I'm very worried. I want to know what happens. The Rector wrote to us about it. It has to change school. To go where ? There's no other here. I know. But I have no power over the orders I receive. Who has power? Who do I speak to ? Who to tell ? I told you. This is an order of the rector. As a director, I am required to run it. Listen, lady, we're your neighbors. Have you ever had to complain about us? What did they reproach us? I do not know you. But you know the situation. Your daughter should not talk about these things at school. She must have talked about it. What did she say? And my husband? He was fired after 20 years without any compensation. My oldest daughter could not go to college. My son could not finish his studies. What should I do ? It's like that here. You should go elsewhere, where nobody knows your religion. Go where ? You know where we come from? We go, kid. It's finished. He leaves in a few hours. I'll see him tomorrow. I drop you. It will be OK. Take a rest. Thank you so much. Goodbye. PRISON CENTER RASHT That's Sahand. He thinks you've been in Tehran for 4 days. Give him that. He is my brother. He brings it back tonight. Go take a shower. Reza ! One! Sign. What's the complaint? You do not get anywhere. These people have long arms. Sell your farm and go away. Go elsewhere. Otherwise they will cut you water. And you will not be able to do anything. Better to sell today than tomorrow. You should not have attacked them. You do not have to sell. But you're not obligated to fight. It is Abbas who did this. Abbas is the stooge of the Company. He does not take initiative. He was commissioned to contaminate the water. Reza... They want this field and you can not help. Do not header. I press charges against him. I will be compensated. Put your family safe, then. If you complaint doors, you will not be compensated one year. In two months, you must repay the credit. You still want to pay 36% penalty in addition to the loan? I'll get my due. You will not even be able to defend yourself. - That's the judgment. - Already? He suffered a broken arm, Abbas? Thou beaten, you ask? No. And yet it is a forensic certificate. They eat them in hand: the judge, the cops, the coroner ... Even the mayor. You have sold off the car to pay off the bank. Everything had to be adjusted for the new year. You go to jail, you have to compensate, our fish died. We lost everything. If you had paid the banker, we would not be there. Reza, you have to like them. Search pistons, buy judges. Otherwise, they will massacre you! We will sell the land to repay the bank. We even compensate Abbas. With the rest, we will leave. We will go elsewhere. We did that this land and this house. We can not lose them. It is not there yet. We have other solutions. Let me do. If I fail, it will sell to the Company. If Abbas renounces its benefits, thanks to the insurance, we can stay alive. I give private lessons, you keep your livestock, we will get along. Sit down there. Hello. You're okay ? Yes Madam. You're not in first? If, ma'am. Why are you so small? But you're pretty. I read your file. We see that you're a good student, very intelligent. Your father is fine ? Yes Madam. His arm better? His arm was not, ma'am. He was not broken? No Madam. That was wrong? You know why you're here? No Madam. I want you to help me. The pride of men sometimes creates problems that only women of intelligence can solve. You know your father and my husband had a fight? No Madam. Your father complained against my husband for a broken arm. The court sentenced us to pay him 13 million. You know what your father did? No Madam. He obtained a false certificate coroner. You recognize that this is not good? Yes Madam. No one should abuse his position. Anyone can be tempted to do so. I, for example ... I could create you problems, right? I can, I am the director. I can send you back, make you repeat a grade. Is it true or not ? Yes Madam. Go tell your father that you can not pay this amount. Even if he could, he would not bow to bullying. Go talk to him and come back with good news. Very well. Go ahead. So it was? She comes from a wealthy family? Rather yes. Why it is so puny? I want to talk to you about something. I do not know if I can. What? I beg you, do not rub yourself with those people. Whose ? The father of the little Abbas. Jafarabadi and family in general. Your husband and you are not from here. You do not know them. It's a dirty breed. Woe to him who seeks them. This girl, you know why it is so small? She has 3 years younger than his papers! It was those of her older sister. Dead to 3 years. It was his father who killed her, Abbas. In a tribal fight, he banged the floor. Then he went to tell the police that it was the others. And he won the case. The guy went to prison and was compensated him. I do not know what to tell you. Forget them. Reza.Â¦ Reza ! Pay them, if necessary, get it over with. If you do not dare, my brother can come with you. Its good. I was away for 4 days. I can prove it. I'm not saying it was you who did it. Look at the contract. Is that your signature? Warranty exclusions are there. Burglary, neighborhood dispute, chemical contamination. "The analysis results established "That death was caused by external contamination." That is to say, deliberate. So it was not an accident. The insurance does not cover such cases. And then we can do nothing. For you, this is not an accident. But my life is ruined. Monsieur. Monsieur. Sit. We must not get carried away. You have suffered damage. We must seek the one who did it. I understand you. He is the chief? I have an urgent request. I must talk to him. I come again. I know you are a respectable family man. You are in trouble. I talked to my boss. I found a solution. There is an exception clause. For it applies, you have two letters. First, you must obtain a letter from prison, certifying your incarceration at the time. We know you were no longer there, but we will manage. Then you must go to the power company. Against a tip, the employee will attest there was a 10-hour power cut in the area that day. With all that, I will go to committee and I will get partial compensation. - Thank you. - You're welcome. God has a solution for everything. Excuse me!Â¦ What do I owe you for your help? Get out, please. It's not worth it. Dad, you know that the Xbox can see us? For example, if I hit you for false, Xbox shown. It's cool, right? - It's expensive, darling. - It's expensive ? Yes, I inquired. Where have you seen this? One day, mom had to do, she left me with my boyfriend. - When you were in Tehran. - In Tehran? Ah yes, in Tehran. You must buy me, Dad? We'll talk, my angel. I'll buy it soon. No empty promises, please. I'll buy him one. No, ma'am, nothing serious. Just an informal talk. This is the director of the school. She can talk to your daughter. - It's not good. - What? He does not let go. - Today ? - No, definitely. Pass it to me. Hello? She hung up. And if she was wearing complaint? But no. They will marry, that's all. You coward ! You hide in the skirts of your wife? If she calls back you'll regret it all your life. What is this about ? I want to sell my farm. - This act is mortgaged. - Yes. I took a credit, two years ago. I will lift the mortgage from the first installment. There is no problem. We made a commitment to sell with the first payment, who can help you. But we need a letter of guarantee. The balance will be paid once the mortgage is lifted. Abbas must withdraw the complaint. This is a private matter. Nothing to do with the company. You have used all means to have my farm. That's it, I sell it. Your Cerberus must withdraw its complaint. Hello how are you ? Thank you. It's about the property adjoining the site ... I had the CEO. Given your economic and professional situation, the company prefers not to commit to you. You do not buy? As I have said, this is not the time. My client is very sensitive to the image of the Company. He does not want to be told that you were in need and he took the opportunity, by devaluing your property. What is your intention? Not at all. But people are chatting, you know. Please. I hurt you, I think. I am sorry. I understand your situation. To help, I can buy it myself. Of course, I do not have the means of the Company. I suggest 50% of their offer last year. Here's my card. Think and let me know. In the Council, we need a strong guy, who do not bribe. The mayor is one of them. They bought it. I can not. I am exhausted. Accept and take care of everything. For compensation Abbas declared insolvent yourself. Your credit is public money. Fat paw to officials and they arrange you this. Removing your complaint to fish and make yourself compensate. It takes the piss. Do not get drafted. Otherwise, they take our land. You turn off your cell phone? No more battery. Could not you warn me that Abbas had come here this morning? For you to come protect me? All you do falls on us. Sahand fought at school. What happened ? He injured the son of the chief of police. He's at the hospital. He will not tell me. We need you to go to school tomorrow. It becomes your copy. Your wife is the director of high school for girls. We are colleagues. And you, I know you. You may remember, when you arrived in Tehran we were in college together. I was the promo before yours. And then I heard about your recent problems. It's small, here, everything is known. All this to tell you I speak knowingly. Speaking ... Do not take it wrong. But your son seems to lack education. He is rebellious. What makes you say that? I told you. I still have ten years of experience. I was a teacher, supervisor and headmaster recently. By dint, I became a child psychologist. This is the first time he has these problems. Hopefully this is the last. But he badly messed up one of his comrades. Nine stitches, anyway. Sahand ? Your son. I talked to him. He said he complained to the supervisor things said by this boy. Nothing was done. He did not seek a fight. He went when the boy blocked his path. Sahand wanted to spend. The other fell. It was an accident. That's what he told you. Sahand never lies. Asghari, CM1. Asghari principal's office. Our problem is that all parents believe their children are perfect. And they forget their first models, it's them. I should teach him to turn the other cheek? You did not change. The same as college. You think you're a hero. I would say that you pay again bullshit of the time. You got fired. And today, you struggle in shit fish. You come here tails between their legs. I must tell you: does not force the kid to become like you. I can ? Lobby, Asghari. Tells how Sahand lashed to his comrade. On returning in the evening, I saw that struck Sahand Ali. I wanted to go to him to stop him. He took a stone and hit it with Ali. If you can not get to apologize, I do it for you. But I do not want to apologize. As his father did not call, your issue is not settled. Apologize, get it over with. You want to be returned? I have enough trouble as it is. Do not add. We're going to the police. You ask forgiveness from his father. He called the manager and we talk about it no more. Come on. - I want to see the chief. - That is why ? It's personal. He is not there. He went on a mission. - Where ? - At the cemetery. You can not pass. - I would like to see your leader. - He is busy. - It will be long? - I do not know. I can wait here? If you want. But I think he has a point. Asghari ! Thank you. This is the horror of this morning. What happened ? A non-Muslim died. We are here to prevent bury here. She committed suicide. A high school girl. They returned, and she killed herself. Why not bury it here? A non-Muslim can not be buried in a Muslim cemetery. You fear that the boosts to go to heaven? Be careful what you say. You are Muslim, right? Stand back! The body returns to the mortuary. - Until when ? - We warn you. Stay here. When you get back it will be packed. Yes sir. - Hello. - What are you doing here ? I came with my son. To apologize. We must reframe this kid. Bring him to the position. Come on! Armpits. The chest. The neck. Under the chin, washes well. Ears. The interior too. Well, now face. Stronger than that. And your shoulders. The other. Behind the neck. The hair. Rub well. Come underwater. Rub well. Rinse the foam in your ears. All right, my son? Hadith! I have not come to fight. But to ask for forgiveness. You're a wuss. First Watch your wife drags in people. Then you come. Go away ! Reza ! It's okay ? What is happening ? Abbas tells things about you. What is he saying ? Where did you go hang out? What are you talking about ? We can know what are you doing? Do not speak to me like that. Answer me ! Where he saw you? I went to Samavat about school. I forbid you to go to that bastard! It was for school, I tell you. Samavat is highly placed, influential, rich! It is our last resort ... He mingles not my life, asshole! You fucked us in the shit and you complain? Why refuse help? Why are you so stubborn? You got all screwed up. That's enough ! Reza! I did not know that Abbas worked for Samavat. Not even that was Samavat of the Company. The school's roof was leaking. I had no budget. He offered to help. I went to get the check and advice. Reza ! Listen to me ! You know what ? You let off steam on me. Do not you manage to cope. It's always the same, you create problems and thou bars. If you do not have shoulders to settle, let me do. The compensation, it must pay. There is the legal certificate. Nothing can be done. This is a bogus certificate. He never had a broken arm. I have a witness. The show will cost more than the compensation. As for your complaint about the fish, I see no solid proof. It's a personal grudge. I can prove it. What you need to prove is that he killed your fish. You have an eyewitness? A surveillance camera? He left traces? So you can not prove anything. In your place, I would do peace with my neighbor. I would save my time, my money and my energy. - Who is here ? - Hi, I'm Reza. A friend of Omid. He no longer lives there. Yes ? Excuse me. You'd have his address? Non. Yet I have told Omid work his social intelligence. The Emotional Quotient, EQ. Penniless, with a teacher salary and a family, what took him? What did he want to change? What could change? Lecturing to his students, to find himself in jail, leaving a family in the lurch. Nowadays, the best we can do, is to raze the walls. You keep an eye on the dollar. And you synchronous remains. - What drink ? - A black. - Hello, where is Sara? - In the car. Sara ! Hurry up. Hello. Hello. What are you doing here ? They came to take him at night. The owner did not want trouble. He transferred us. My translations do not make me live. You should have warned me. For you to do what? All her friends have dropped. They all had an excuse. I thought you knew, you'd end up coming. I knew nothing. I was very busy lately. We all have our problems. What did they accuse him of? According to you ? Endangering national security. Propaganda against the regime. It will look in 6 years. 6 years ? And it will no longer teach. Remember to plant, Omid and you, you are arrested for protesting against the quality of meals. You remember what you told me, once released? That in this country, it is necessarily either oppressor or oppressed. There were no other options. But you've found another. You left in the North. You created your farm, a family. You don't take care of others. I have a dream, is being able to translate a book for fun, without anxiety. You saw when the last time? Last week. They left me a few minutes. He started a novel. I want the strength to Omid. Cut the engine. You do not want to go about it? I beg your pardon. This is not enough. We have to speak. Our life collapses. Stop ! I beg your pardon. What wrong have I done? What do you have ? Cut the engine. I decided to solve everything. Screaming like that? I need 500,000. To do what ? I must have them. I do not have them. - I must have them ! - I do not have them ! - We'll talk tonight. - He takes me now! Where will you that I find them? In this great school, there is not the money? What are you a merchant? I need that money. I will repay. It's my turn. Too strong ! Two - zero! You're cheating. You play with both hands. Who was it ? The son of Abbas. He wanted what? Abbas was arrested on a drug case. That does not concern us, though? Take Sahand and going to your brother. But why ? Reza ? These people are dangerous. Even to their own children. You wanted me to fight? I fight. Go get business. Since the arrest of Abbas, speaking only of you. You must act quickly. He will be released in a few days. He will be enraged. Go tell Samavat you know that Abbas delivers him his opium. You do not want to get him into trouble, but if the company continues to support Abbas they will all be involved in drug trafficking. Threatens it. He will be forced to fire Abbas. What is Samavat doing in there? Samavat is the Company itself. This is the real boss. Goodbye. Open. PRISON CENTER RASHT You remember me ? I was there a few days. You said I could come see you. There were how many? Three grams. So, 2 million fine, 70 lashes and five years in prison. But he can escape. If this is his first time. It's the case. If you pay it out in a week. One week ? You're his partner? You're afraid he'll swing you? I told you, this is my friend. I'll introduce a guy tomorrow in court. He shall you this. There is something else. It is a mess. It's been 40 years that smoke. Without that, it will not hold. Tell him Samavat greet. He takes care of everything. You want the sauce? Good evening. Go with your uncle. - You enter ? - No, thank you. So see you soon. Let me go. I need clothes. It will take a few days. Take care of yourself. If you slip I will leave you in the shit I will through you out. And I will say that you were paid. So do not look for me. Mind your own business. If you hold on tight I will owe you one. Thanks for coming. My condolences. My condolences. It's good you came. We do not suspect you. I will make you the mayor. Thank you for getting us rid of him. But open your eyes wide. Whoever killed your fish for you to turn against Abbas is around, watch out. You've got fire ? What a strange world. We do not know what awaits us. Samavat has a new offer. Things have changed. It seeks to replace Abbas. Instead of buying your farm, we suggest you represent the Company in the region. Think about my proposal. A MAN OF INTEGRITY Adaptation: Massoumeh Lahidji
