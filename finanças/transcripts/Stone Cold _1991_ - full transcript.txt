LANCE: They've been on a killing spree. Three local religious figures were murdered there in the last month. They convicted one Brotherhood biker of it and the day after the sentencing, the judge was found dead. Yeah, I read about it. We know they're responsible, we just can't prove it. We also suspect them of working with the Mafia. They're trying to branch out nationwide into drugs, contract hits, prostitution, you name it. Washington wants to shut them down. So then... you're not investigating me? You've logged more biker-related arrests than any other officer in Alabama. So how would you go about nailing these guys? The agent infiltrates the organization, turns a witness, sets up a sting, nabs them in the act. That's right, isn't it? Yeah. I'd give him three days before they drag his ass down the interstate. - Don't you think if they take a prospect... - Prospect?

We can arrange to have your suspension lifted. We want you to go undercover inside the Brotherhood. Agent Dockery would be your contact in the field. Call me Lance. No sale. I think I'll sit out my three weeks. Well, Huff, your three week suspension just became six months. Without pay. - On the other hand... - That's blackmail. Oh, no, no, no... the FBI doesn't believe in blackmail. Well... the choice is yours. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Good morning. It's 6:02, time to rise and shine. Glad you're aboard with us.

Old ladies included. - Fuck yourself. - Nancy, listen. If you cooperate, I can guarantee you immunity. Relocation. But you're gonna have to trust me. What's going on, Chains? I thought this was my deal. - Why the switch? - Time to crack the fucking Whip. Hey. What's the matter? Don't you trust me? It doesn't matter where. This is how I do business, man. Fine. We'll settle up later. Get off my horse. (BIKE ENGINE STARTING) I'll get back to you. Joe, what happened out there? Chains pulled a switch on me. The deal went down at a different location. Oh, that's terrific. So we got $1 million of P2P out on the street? As if that wasn't enough, I overheard one of the brothers say they're gonna crack the Whip. - As in Whipperton? - Yeah. We just dropped a dime on your boy. You better call Cunningham. Shit! I got to stop that truck. You can't go back there. They must be on to you by now, Joe. If they were, I'd be dead by now.
