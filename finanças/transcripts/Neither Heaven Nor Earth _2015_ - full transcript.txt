NEITHER HEAVEN NOR EARTH Afghanistan 2014, Wakhan District Here boy. Lie down. Here. South Post for North Post. South Post, come in. Captain, I got eyes on a civilian. Headed down from the village, sector 43 toward the border. It’s Malek’s son. North Post, you copy? He’s entering your sector. What the fuck? Position. Attention, warning shots. Goliath! South Post, you see the dog? Negative, Captain. JB, is the dog there? Don’t think so. - We can’t find it. - Hold on... - Are you going to the shura? - Lernowski is. Lernowski! Those two are for the village. No one’s seen it. Ask why he was down by the border, he knows he shouldn’t be there. It’s not your problem. It is so! He has no business there. He wants money for the sheep. Remind him how we’re keeping the village safe. He doesn’t care. He wants money. Sure, I’ll write him a check. What does Malek say? Haven’t I always been clear? The sheep died in your barbwire so you must pay. I’m not paying! Let’s not argue. We’ll leave it at that. We’ll meet again next week. Thank you, everyone. Get down! Where are they? 12 o’clock! I don’t see them! William! Contact. Come in! South Post, you see them? Negative, no visual. Shooters in 43-7 or 43-8. Stay covered, Captain. Where are they? Right! Further right. William! You’re not hit. Benj! Straight ahead. - 12 o’clock, along the ridge. - I’m ready! Two shooters behind the third rock. Now! Further right. Go! Fire! Further right. Fire! I gotta go. I love you too. Sit down. - Sorry for earlier. - Forget it. Happens to everyone. How’s your wife? Fine. I don’t tell her everything. The less you say, the better. Any day now, right? - A boy? - A little man. I’ll ask Lernowski to tattoo his birth date. Tek, we can’t let him do it. Either you or me, but not him. I hate not having armored vehicles. - Ever see a guy get wasted in one? - No. I saw it once in Kabul. We had to get the body. Holy shit, Tek. That guy was a puzzle. Pieces everywhere! Fingers in a glove... bits of flesh... A charred knee all by itself in the gravel. We had to pick it all up. Piece by piece. It took us... Bax, how long did it take? Maybe 4 or 5 hours. When we were done, the bag weighed less than a man. He’d been so blown to bits, there was nothing left. What’d you do? The captain took the bag, went and dug up some dirt to add to it. We sealed the bag and casket so the family couldn’t open it. The guy was sent back home like that, dirt and all. What the hell? North Post for Base. North Post for Base! North Post, come in. Mercier, get me the captain! What are they doing? Bax. North Post, come in. Captain, I got a dozen villagers up on the ridge. They’re burning something. Have they come down near the posts? No, they’re in their sector. - What do I do? - Nothing. As long as they stay there, just keep an eye on them. Yes, sir. North Post. Now what? We can’t find Tek and Delcourt. What? Their post is empty. They weren’t replying. I thought their radio broke, but the relief just arrived and no one’s there. When? Just now. I sent everyone out but we found nothing. What happened? Did you see any civilians come near? Negative. They went back to the village. After that, it was quiet. I don’t get it, Captain. They couldn’t go without you seeing! I don’t understand. My eyes were glued to the sector. Did you fall asleep? How could you miss this? They never would’ve left. There had to be some contact. Contact? They must’ve heard a noise, gone to see and something happened. We’ll find them hollering down some hole. Where were the civilians? Up on the ridge. It’s a sheep, Captain. Was your last radio contact before or after the civilians? Before, I think. Hey Captain... Bax! Get them. Any trace of my men, I’m taking everyone! No one’s done anything. What were those kids doing up there? Taking the sheep up. Why aren’t you in school? - He’s a shepherd. - A shepherd. Right, you’re all shepherds. Show me your hands. Come on! Clean for a shepherd. Search him. See if he’s got a cell phone. He’s clean. What were you doing up there? - Burning the sheep from the barbwire. - Why? It wasn’t killed properly so they couldn’t eat it. I need to be told when more than 2 men go to the valley! No one goes to the valley. What about him, the other day? Men with sheep don’t count. You’re protecting someone. You’re afraid! It’s “Sultan”, isn’t it? Where is he? If I have to burn the village down to find my men, I will! There’ll be nothing left but ashes! If you do, we’ll walk to Kabul to report you, and it is you who will finish in ashes. Don’t use that tone with me. What do they want? Money? I don’t know. This isn’t Kabul, it doesn’t work like that. Make them talk. What? You think they’re Al-Qaeda? Here’s last night’s satellite images at 30-second intervals. Between the villagers leaving at 2:44 and the relief arriving at 6:03, there is no trace of any movement in the sector or at the border. Yet two of you were watching. - William? - Yes? Go over there. - What’d I do now? - Go over there. - Here? - A little further. Sit in the middle of the camp. Right here? That’s good. Look at him. - See him? - Yeah. Corporal’s turn. Something this simple blocks heat. Don’t believe only what you see in the goggles. No more of these. For now, we have no idea what happened. If they’re dead or alive. But we’re going to find them. Those who know me will vouch for this: I have never left a man, body or even a vehicle behind. We’ll scour the sector. Here are my orders: Always stay in view of squad leaders, day and night. We close the posts and adjust the windows. No one can get in or out through them. Motion detectors go above each post. For now, no talk of the missing men until we have news for their families. It’ll be tough but I’m blocking the phone line for now. You may go. I don’t buy it. The blanket doesn’t work in motion. It’s noisy and heat leaks. What am I supposed to say? They may have gone AWOL. To get their throats slit in Pakistan? Captain? May I ask you something? Go ahead. I’d like a benediction. A chaplain? Now? If there’s more fighting and something happens... Over there, that’s not enough? Benedictions are for the dead. What you need is sangfroid. That gets you home in one piece. I’ll see what I can do. Fighters of Wakhan! This sector is under international control. We are prepared to hear your demands for the release of our hostages. Cease fire and open negotiations. Lernowski, what you got? A stake, Captain. Describe it. No wires? No, that’s it. A meter high, metal, rusty. Have Mercier use the detector. Nothing to report. Just an old stake. Nothing to report, Captain. OK, carry on. You haven’t been relieved? I’m not budging till we get those bastards. If it were up to me, we wouldn’t be dicking around. What would you do? Make those villagers talk. Come on, the night our guys disappear, they burn a sheep? Civilian approaching! Soldiers of France! Open the gate! Tear gas! Who is this clown? Search him! He’s clean. Have him identify himself. His name’s Gulbbudin Bakhtawar. Has he seen many men without clothes? What? Has he seen many men without clothes? No, he’s seen many clothes without men. Let him in. He says the Colonel in Kabul sent him. You have messages for him... I think he means pictures. Does the colonel receive him like that? Everyone knows him in Kabul. Silly Christian, throwing smoke when he comes to help. It’s OK. Here are photos of my two men. He follows the Colonel’s orders and returns once he learns something. Next time: off the bike, hands in the air and wait. So he’s not tear-gassed or shot in the head. Got it? - Is that a yes? - Yes. Ask when he thinks he’ll be back. Inshallah when? Whatever, show him out. Thank you. South Post for Base. South Post for Base. South Post, come in. He’s gone. Leaving sector 43-9 at 21:45. Roger. Want some? No. What’s going on? Animal. Going out to check. Go ahead. Nothing to report. There it is! He sure smoked that sucker! - Got any chocolate left? - In my bag. - Where? - Top pocket. - Hanging in there? - Yeah. I saw them the other night. Saw who? Tek and Delcourt. In a dream. It was in a cave. They were there, sleeping. And? That’s all. It was just weird to see them. You gotta learn to shut up. Everyone thinks you need to shut your trap and open fire when you’re told. I gotta piss. Cover me. Ben? I was there, as usual! - Where? - Right there, like that. You fell asleep? We didn’t see the detector go on. The sun was up! - Tell the truth. - He’s the one who fell asleep! - You’re lying! - He never moved! You leave me no choice, William. In the stockade! Your hands. They’re in my zone of fire, what do I do? Wait! What’s he saying? Khalil? I can’t hear. What’s he saying? Translate! He wants to negotiate with you. Tomorrow morning at 6:00 at the border. Tell him I accept but at noon, in broad daylight. He accepts. I don’t want you up there. You put the section in danger. You’ll be interrogated by high command. You’ll return with the first convoy. It’s best for us all. There’ll be an investigation, you’ll testify. What for? He was there, he fell asleep. That’s what I’ll testify! Get a different story. You need me up there, we have to go back! Something’s going on! Of course it is. Men are being killed or kidnapped. We need to go back up and sleep there, to figure it out! - Before we’re all gone! - You missed something. We all missed something. Get ahold of yourself. You’re going to write down exactly what happened and sign it. Is that clear? You’ve got some explaining to do. It won’t be easy. But we’ll find them and we’ll go home. They’ve been informing all along, it’s a code. No sheep at the stake: clear. Sheep: danger. Why don’t we shoot the sheep? No, call it off. Double back. Men, head back! Where are they? - What do you see up there? - Nothing, Captain! He says, “What do you want?” My men! I want my men! - He wants his men. - What men? I have no idea! I want proof my men are alive. He hasn’t got your men, but he’ll negotiate for his men. They aren’t here, or he hasn’t got them? He hasn’t got your men and he thinks you’ve got his! Tell him to come out slowly. We’ll talk face to face. Careful, they’re coming out! Nobody shoot! Cover me. Who has his men if it’s not us? How many has he lost and how? He who attacks with unknown arms will know Allah’s hatred. Ask if he is “Sultan”. He is, and who are you to ask? I sent a man to Pakistan 2 days ago to negotiate for me. An Afghan. Has he seen him? He’s seen no one. I’ll offer him a deal. He can search for his men freely here in my sector, and I’ll search on his side. - What the fuck, Antarès? - Translate! We call a cease-fire. No shooting until we’ve found our men. He may even go to the village, up there. The “village of liars”. What’s he saying? - He’s pretending to talk to someone. - Are you sure? Yes, he’s talking by himself. We can’t negotiate with the Taliban! He’s lying! We can’t do this. He wants a guarantee. If I find who has my men, we’ll find his too. You must swear. I swear. His turn. He swears but he’ll cut your throat if you betray him. Everyone, let them through. Do we go? We wait. Allah can’t prevent more fires or attacks. I can. Allah is great. Malek, don’t you want what’s best for your village? It’s not for me to decide what happens. It’s your war, it’s not for us to help. You want the Taliban here or your country’s army? I want nothing. Allah decides and... - And? - Screw you. This is useless. Captain! Look! It was at their home. Where’d you get it? His son found it in the valley. He found the motorbike here. There was nobody. You said that. I want the rest. Even if it takes all night, you will talk. Get lost! You too will disappear like dogs. Son of a bitch! You dog! He keeps insulting you. Take it easy! That’s enough! He wants his father off the ground. He’ll talk if you pick up his father. Not on the ground, up on the bike! I’m listening. What’s going on? This is Allah’s land. Is this what you want? He did nothing. So, this is Allah’s land? Sergeant, “Allah” is all you’ll get! Translate. Yes. How far does Allah’s land reach? Behind the mountain then it stops. Are the camp and village on Allah’s land? No. Is it forbidden to walk here? You can walk but not sleep. Why? What happens if I sleep? - Allah takes you back. - Cut it out! Ask when it started. When the soldiers came? No, long before. Since when? Come here. Give it to him. In here. No, there. Why bring sheep here? There’s no grass. That’s where Allah forgives. What happens then? - You are forgiven. - Is that all? He doesn’t return the men? I bring a sheep for Allah, it disappears and I’m forgiven. No, you leave it a full day, take it back to the village and cut its throat. What if Allah takes it? - Allah won’t take the sheep. - Why? It doesn’t sleep on the ground. Yes, it does! All sheep sleep on the ground. If the sheep is alone, it is scared and sleeps standing up. And dogs? Dogs sleep on the ground so they disappear. Look. I lie down here and I fall asleep. Don’t do that. While I sleep here, a man comes and kills me in the night. He takes me off and burns me. Translate. You come and say, “Allah took him,” but a man killed me. You don’t see Allah do it, so you can’t be sure. Yes, I can. How can you be sure of something you don’t see and never have? Look over there. It’s dark and you don’t see the men. But with your goggles, you see them. If you don’t see the men, it doesn’t mean they’re not there, it means it’s dark and you have no goggles. Captain, it’s Base. Captain, William got away! He took the motorbike! William! There! It’s locked inside. It’s his, Captain. Sleeping pills. We need to get out of here! Captain, I’m not going back up. - We need to strike back! - Against who? We need proof. Facts! For 5 days we’ve been looking for proof. Following orders! 4 men are gone and the Taliban’s back as a result! - It’s inexplicable! - We just lack the explanation. Share your thoughts, Antarès. - We don’t know our enemy. - How can we fight then? I’m done. I’m calling the families and high command. Don’t touch that! It’s 11:00, Wednesday. The last convoy goes tomorrow at 8. Whoever wants can leave with it. But decide now. You won’t get a second chance! If you choose to stay, it means one thing is clear: no matter what happens, I am and will remain in command. Oscar Varennes, chaplain. Delighted, Captain. 35th regiment, 4th company. How long have you been here, Captain? A few weeks. Any fighting? Not really. A delicate mission, that’s all. - Did they say something? - No, that’s the thing. My job is observing people, to feel if they’re on the edge. Your men are about to plummet. Do your job, reassure them. Reassure them? You think God is a teddy bear you hold at night? I don’t know, tell them... God is Love. Look at the shit going on around you, how can you say that? That’s enough. You leave tomorrow with the convoy at 8:00. “While the men were in a deep slumber, a voice came unto me. It whispered and said, ‘Man’s life on earth is that of a soldier, his days, those of a hireling.’ I was at ease, but He has shaken me. He seized my neck and broke me. He shot at me as his target. He opened breach upon breach. He swooped upon me like a warrior. It is He who pursues me. He has broken me asunder, treated me as an enemy. His troops mobilize and encamp round my tent. Soon, I shall sleep in the dust. He will seek me and I will be gone.” - Got a signal? - Yes. Satellite call. - Who is it? - William’s wife, for you. - How’d she get this number? - Beats me. Captain Bonassieu? - How’d you get this number? - William gave it to me. The baby came, I want him to know. - This is a military line. - Put him on. - I’ll tell him. - Let me do it! You can’t. - I’m hanging up now. - Wait! Goodbye. Antarès? What’s going on? Go back where I can see you. Antarès! It’s OK. I’m fine. I can do this. You’re way too scared. It’ll happen. It’s a matter of time. I haven’t slept in days. When I do, I have the same dream. I see them... See who? Delcourt, Tek, Benj, William. Sleeping in a cave, beneath the border. William screwed with your mind. William? He told me that dream. He told everyone. He didn’t tell me. No one told me anything. He says go away, he was here first. Who drew this circle? He did. What’s in there? - It’s the place from the sura. - What? What sura? The People of the Cave. The villagers told him. Get a reading. Black probe first. Well? There’s a cavern 3m down. The high point? There’s a conduit near here. Sergeant, there’s activity. They want to see the hole. Tell them no weapons. They’re afraid. - Of what? - What we’ll find. It’s the story of some men who flee the city. They hide in a cave and ask God for help. God puts them to sleep for many years. Some say there were four, others five. Some say there were seven men and a dog. A dog? Yes, there was also a shepherd with his dog they met along the way. The dog fell asleep outside the cave, with its paws outstretched. You could see its teeth. Its eyes were open as if guarding the cave, though it had been asleep for years. And when they woke up... Let’s keep going. Move everything down. We tried, there’s no one down there! I saw it in a dream. They must be there! How can they be? There’s no way in or out! Let’s go before the F-16s get here. - Khalil? - I have no idea. He’s saying something! You’re out of control. The captain’s worse than a goat! How can he tether his sheep with all this mess? There. Satisfied? You won’t find them. No one will. They’re gone! Now you must fill in the hole! Captain Bonassieu, I haven’t heard from William for a week. No answers from the camp. There are rumors here. The families talk of fighting and hostages. If something’s happened or he’s in danger, I want to know. Now. What’s going on? It’s started. It’s Him. Listen closely, Captain. First, there was nothing, not even rocks. Then He put the trees there... animals... women... men, you, me. But it’s over now. He’s taking us back one by one. It started here but it may be happening elsewhere. Soon it will be everywhere. Everyone! He’ll take children... fathers, mothers. Soon there’ll be nothing left, no one. Someone will call out, and no one will reply. I’m afraid, Captain. Afraid of that. Antarès! Antarès! Get me four and shear them. What? Sarah, the fighting has started again. I can’t talk about it. There’s nothing to say. No one here can say anything. Everyone fights, shuts their mouth and closes their eyes. So I shut up too and close my eyes. I close them now, Sarah. I’m invisible. I’m here in the mountains, in fear. I’m there in our home, next to you and our baby. I open them and wonder if it was real. William, I don’t recognize you. I don’t recognize your words. What’s going on? You said the fighting was over, you’d be home in a matter of days. Your mother and I saw new footage from over there. They announce more casualties. Apparently, many soldiers return in silence, they lose the ability to speak. Come back to us, William. Back to me. At ease. Captain Bonassieu, by exposing your men to friendly fire, you have caused 4 of them to die. By virtue of article L-456B, you are under arrest and must appear before the international court. Pending investigation results, you shall be held prisoner. Order arms! Sarah, the assault began tonight. All around, I hear the cries of men and the clash of weapons. I take a deep breath and slowly subside. The earth lulls me back home like a disobedient son who has strayed too long. I hear the dead speak. For Tek. Our dead. For Delcourt. All our dead. For Benj. They know me. - For William! - They call me home. Sarah, I’m not asleep. I’m not gone. I haven’t disappeared. I am absent. I await you behind a door. In a world within the world. A world beside the world. A world around the world.
