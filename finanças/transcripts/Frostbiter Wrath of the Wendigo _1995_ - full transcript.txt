NARRATOR: It was nearly 100 years ago. I was but a lone trapper then and would Spend my winters on Manitou Island, where Small game were plentiful. I'd heard the legend of the Wendigo, But a man's ignorance of things unseen is never questioned. Legend became life when I came face to face With the monstrous snow beast. It was a fierce battle that rocked the world. But through some grace of God, I was victorious, And my life would never again be the same. The moment I defeated the beast, I Realized I must protect the world From this evil monstrosity's resurrection. Knowing the legend, I marked this spot, this sacred ground With the skulls of all the previous victims Of the Wendigo, creating a spiritual shield To protect the world. However, if the circle was ever broken, The Wendigo would be reborn once again, more powerful than ever. And now it is here, in this circle, that I've remained. For, be it a blessing, be it a curse, I am the chosen one. I am the Guardian. [Gun shot] I'll drink to that. Here's to the three-breasted women of good old Tibitan. And now, my good old friend, let's Make a toast to ourselves. Another round, please. Thank you. This one's mine. To my good friend, Larry. Who's dad's name was Barry. It's so damn scary. His mom was so hairy. But I got to thank him for bringing me out early. Shooting them signs. Little squirrelies and I figure if we keep drinkin', we're Going to end up... Drunk! [Laughing] I'm itchin' to blast something. I was hopin' I'd run out of booze. What? Keep out? Private? There isn't any private property on this island While we're here. Ready? Aim. Fire. [Gun shot] Woo, oo, oo. Oh, look, a fence. I guess we're gonna have to turn back. Private property? [Laughing] There's your private property. Let's see if anyone's home. What? Something illegal's going on here. Holy cow! It's murder, mass murder. Look at all them skulls. Where you going? I'm going inside. Man, let's just get the hell outta here. [Door creaks] You leave my land. I'm not about to let some old bum tell me where I can't hunt. Respect is an attribute, my friend, one you should learn. Respect? I think you need to learn to respect The man with the high powered weapon in his hand. Hey, man, let's just leave him alone. Leave me alone. I shall ask you once again to leave my land. You've never seen one of these babies in action, old man. You think you might want a demonstration? You have no idea what you may be the cause of. Let's just get out of here, OK? [Gun shot] Shut up, or I'll blow your head off. Please go. [Gun shot] No! The circle has been broken. The wind it whispers. Tell me. The wind whispers. Wendigo. Wendigo. Now what are we going to do? Gotta get rid of him. [Hoarsely gasping] What do you mean? [Crash] Ah! What the hell? [Crashing and shattering glass] Ah! What's going on? What the... [Smash] [Buzzing] [Screaming] [Evil laughter] Whoa! [Clattering] [Dying scream] Dave! [Screaming] The circle has been broken. You are the chosen one. You must complete the circle. [Laughter] I'm out. You're out. Pay up, you saps. What do you mean, you're out? Pete, talk to our man here about your low interest loans. What's the matter, pard? You got a bad set of cards? Are you outta cash? Well, I- Pete's Pawns can do you a deal. Yeah, ride 'em, Hoss. You got something to trade? You got something to sell? Or do you just need a loan? Well, come on down to Pete's Pawns. Our interest rates are famously low city-wide. And we ain't just city wide. Hell, county wide, and we ain't never, Never turned down a deal. Now how much you need? Uh, five bucks. Five bucks. Five. Very good, son. Always glad to do business with a fine, upstanding Citizen like yourself. [Laughing] What did I do? I didn't mean it. I swear to God I didn't mean it. I'll tell them it was an accident. That's it. No, wait a minute. I'll tell them Dave shot the old dude. No, no. Dave's in enough trouble already. First things first. Big monster. Giant monster. Got to get off the island. Got to round everybody up and get off the island. That's it. Get off the island. [Wolves howl and grown] [Laughing] I warned you suckers, let a dead man die. I got to get out. God. Oh, holy smoke. What a flight. What a flight. I felt like I was in a bag and they put me in a bag... Here, here. Chug it. Oh! You know, if you've ever been to Albany, New York. If you've ever flown in there... Hey, where's this new guy? Oh, I forgot. Oh, God. [Laughing] [Interposing voices] What? Is there a problem? Black man can't hunt? We didn't mean nothing. I know, us brother's don't like the cold, right? Well, I got some news for you, don't ask to see my frostbite. [Laughing] Hey, I get it. I get it. I know where I'm not wanted. Oh, come on. [interposing voices] No, I ain't staying. Come on. And Come on Leo, they didn't mean anything. Come on. Leo. We didn't mean anything. No offense. We didn't even know Tony was bringing anybody, right? No. No. See, this has kind of been like our own secret little circle For the last five years. No offense meant. My name's Pete. Leo Phillips. You can call me Leo. Jerry. Lee. It TELVISION ANNOUNCER: This is Brick Branding in downtown Tecumseh. And at the top of our news, there's a winter storm, Which has still not let up. All throughout the state, the rampages of the storm are being Felt. Over 100 schools have been forced to close down But the hardest hit is the Upper Peninsula. Not like the ones in '66. Well. What have we got here? I need to get to the island. First in the morning. No. I need to get to the island tonight. Lady, if we go out in that storm tonight... Is there anyone else who can take me? Lady, I'm the only pilot here. If it's that important, you can walk across the ice. OK. Well, I've done more stupid things for a lot less money. Let's go. Finally Tony gets to my house, about two hours late. Now, this is when the fight starts. I'm driving out of my neighborhood When this black cat darts across the street, I mean right in front of us. No way on God's green earth could we have missed it. Boom. I mean, you could hear it hit the bottom of the car. And by now, I'm wondering if I was Ever meant to go on this trip. So Tony pulls the car over and we get out. Oh, come on, man, they do not want to hear the rest of this. No, we want to hear. Anyway, but anyway, we're out of the car And we're looking for this cat everywhere, and can't find it. All of a sudden, I hear this, boom, boom, boom. And I look around and there's Tony kicking at the tire. I said, what the hell are you doing, man? He said, I found it. I caught it in the wheel well. So by the time I get around there, he's got it out. And this cat's laying there, all mangled and dead. Is this a joke? No, it's no joke. I mean, look we got out, and I didn't Even want to touch the things. Old Daniel Boone here, he has to put it in the first year. That's where we should have left it. But Mr. Humanitarian here, he can't leave well enough alone. Well, you can't just leave somebody's dead cat, I mean, mangled, lying on their front lawn. I mean, that's disgusting. No, no, Your dinner was disgusting. So I picked up this cat and we're Going to take it to the house. The weird thing was when we get to the porch, The front door flies open and this half Naked woman comes running out. I mean, she's screaming, she was barefoot And bawling her eyes out. Yeah I mean, this was sad, it was really sad. I mean, she grabs this bloody pile out of my hands And she starts hugging. And I'm going, oh, great, what are we supposed to do now? I mean, this cat's more important to her Than her husband. You know, but I said, look, I explained to her, lady, We didn't mean any harm by running over your cat. And besides, I thought I'd offer her a couple of bucks for it. I didn't even think she'd take it. But she says OK. So what do you think a cat's worth? $5, $10? She told us it's worth $2,000. - Right. - What? That's what I said. No way. I don't have $2,000. For a cat? So listen, I offer her $100. Yeah, then I offer her $100 on top of that. $200. $200 for a cat? You're kidding me. Oh, but that's not all. Finally, we get out of there. And we're driving away and we're driving And this cop car comes barrelling Down the street, light flashing, the siren's wailing. And they pull into her driveway. And I say, turn around, let's go see what's going on. So we turn around and when get back, The cops are with this lady, handcuffing her and putting her In their car. So I get out of the car and the cops walk right over to me And he goes, this yours? And he hands me the $200. I go, yes, officer. I go, what's going on? What did she do? And he looks me right in the face. I mean dead in the face, like I did something wrong. And he goes, listen, son, everyone in this state Knows it's illegal to sell pussy. [Laughing] On you. That's real funny. That's really bad. [Laughing] Does rough flying bother you? I'm OK. Well, I'd say this is the worst series of storms We've had in the last decade, but nothing Like the ones in '66. Do you know the island very well? Lady, I grew up here. I know everything about this place. Is there anything strange, like maybe some strange landmark In a weird shape or anything? The only time anyone ever pays any attention to this island Is during deer season, which happens to start tomorrow. Few drunk hunters, fooling and shooting themselves. Ah, nothing ever happens out of the ordinary here. You can't think of anything or even anyone strange? There is an old guy. He don't bother nobody. And nobody don't bother him. Sandy. You are the new guardian. And my powers have been passed on to you. As a guardian, it was my death that caused The release of the Wendigo. And it is your strength that will defeat it. Beware the Wendigo's sentinels, warriors That will try to destroy you. You must find the circle and complete it before the sun Rises on two days. During this time, the Wendigo's strength will grow. And you will become weak. If the circle is not completed, you and many others will die. What was that? Jesus! Something's jumping on the tail. The first sentinel. What? What the hell is jumping on my plane? You've got to get down! I can't even see. How in the hell can I land? It's on the plane. It's tearing up the plane. You've got to land. I told you I can't see two feet in front of me. How in the hell can I land? It's still out there. You've got to get this plane down. [Screaming] [Screaming] [Snoring] [Heavy breathing] [Snoring] Hey, get up! That thing out there. It's coming! What the hell are you doing, man? That damn Wendigo. It's out there! Wait, wait. The Hoodigo is what? No, the Wendigo. It's big, man, real big. What the hell's going on in here? This guy just broke in and he's messing up all your furniture. You guys got to listen. I know I sound like an old '50s B movie, But there's a gigantic blue monster out there That's called the Wendigo. And it's already killed my buddy. Yeah, right. I got the munchies. Anybody else hungry? I am. Me too. What do you got? What did you call that thing? The Wendigo. Me and my buddy, Dave, accidentally shot this old man And everything went nuts. The old guy melted down into a skeleton. Then it came alive. It grabbed Dave, smashed me in the face. I got up. I got hit. The Wendigo grabbed Dave and ripped His head clean off and put it on a pole Next to all these skeletons. The only reason I got away, is that thing Was still busy eating Dave. It was eating him raw. [Snoring] When did all this happen? Oh, come on, Pete. The guy is nuts. I want some of my bodacious chili. Well, we can't do anything until morning. But I don't understand all this business about the Wendigo. Yeah, it's an old Algonquin Indian legend. In the middle of winter, when the winter storms have killed All the game, and there was no food anywhere, You know, the Indians would come in the middle of the night. And they'd get one of their own people, and kill him. Then they'd eat him. I'm hungry. It's just their word for cannibalism. There's no such thing as a Wendigo. I mean, the Indians would say, in the middle of the night, The Wendigo ate Geronimo. It was just another excuse for their hunger. Tell that to Dave. How do you know all this? As my great grandmother used to say, lift your feet, The shit's getting thick. And the chili's good and ready. No, you guys don't understand. We've got to round up everyone that's left on this island And get out of here! Hot chili. Listen, man, why don't you get off of this? Do you need a place to stay until you Come off your drunk, well fine, you can stay with us. As far as that monster stuff, nobody here Believes it, especially me. I wouldn't say that. Why? Is it gonna get me? Ah! [Screaming] I told you it was real. I told you! [Screaming] Look out. Put him out! Put him out! [Screaming] Help me! Put him over there, on the cot. Be careful with him. Oh my god, what are we going to do? I don't know. We don't have many choices. The hell we don't! We gotta get out of here! How? The only way on or off this island Is Duke's Charter Service. And we have no way of getting a hold of him until the morning When he flies in. I guess we're stuck here until then. [Screaming] I'm going to get rid of this stuff. Not that it matters. That thing is everywhere anyways. Hey, Leo, Leo. Where you going? Hey! Come back here. You can't go out there. We can't let him go out in those woods. Let him go. What? I said, let him go. Peter's right. Leo is a hothead, but, I mean, after all, The guy did just lose a hand. Storm out there will cool him off. He'll be in soon enough. OK, but it's all your shoulders this time now. I'm not going to take the rap for this one too. Listen, we don't have time for Leo's crying. If he wants to try and get out of here tonight, let him. Well, what's your plan? Three of us will head out in the morning And meet Duke when he flies in. The other two will stay here. When you find Duke, get back here, and we'll take Jerry out. When I find Duke? What do you mean when I find Duke? I'm not going to go out there. Hey, don't worry. I'll go along with you. Oh, great. That makes me feel real good. Two stooges against King Kong. I'm no stooge, pal, I'll have you know. I had an encounter with a Big Foot once. Come on. No, really. It was in a restroom in the Smoky Mountains. I think you're talking about big ass, not foot. Actually, his whole body is quite large. And the phrase referring to his foot Actually denotes a small piece of his anatomy Which selectively refers to the... Wait a minute, Tony, I thought you Didn't believe me in any of that hokey pokey legend stuff. Yeah, Tony. I thought it was just an old Algonquin Indian legend. I was skeptical myself, until I actually Encountered the Big Foot. Yeah. I'll never forget the relief of finally getting To use a flush toilet and the sheer terror of coming face To face with the Sasquatch. Oh, sure. Big ass gotta poop too? Hey, fellas, I don't think Jerry's doing too well here. He's breathing's real weird like there isn't any sometimes. [Scream from outside] What was that? [Door creaks open] Be careful! God. Help me, Please. Are you OK? What happened? What did you see? Was it big? What the hell's going on? What happened to Jerry over here? Hold it, hold it! Are you all right? We were sleeping my boyfriend woke up. He thought he heard something rummaging outside. He went out to check. It's all right. Don't worry about it. Then there were the footsteps in the snow coming closer And closer then they stopped. Why don't you go lay down on the cot for a minute And take a rest. Except the wind. The wind seemed to whisper. See, I told you, it whispers. It said, Wendigo, Wendigo. Great. Lay down over here and try and get some rest. No. Too hot. Hot. It's too hot. Too hot. Hot. Hot Too hot. [Growling] Holy Toledo. Open the door! What the Sam Hill's going on here? Open the door! [Screaming] Come and get me, boys. Get it out of here. Who's first for my tasty treats? Grab her. [Screaming] Let's get it. Get it off me. Please get it off me. Want to dance? I don't know. It's been awhile. Grab her. Throw the witch into the wall. One, two, three. Ah! You're all gonna die, whether you perish in this cabin Or out in the freezing cold. Shut up, bitch. You may be friends now, but you'll Become cannibals and feast on the flesh of the others. Not even the chosen one can save you. [Unearthly scream] [Explosion] Leo, I don't know how you dealt with being Out alone last night because I got a bad feeling about this. Yeah, unless it's got US grade A prime ribs stamped On the side, and done medium well, You've got a bad feeling about it. Look, I just don't like being out here, that's all. I mean we don't know where that thing is. Yeah, well, it's my guess that it's just as safe out here As it is in that cabin. That's right. You're right. That's right. It's everywhere. And it's everything. That's right. He's right. You're right. What's the matter with you, man? Me? Nothing. We just can't let that thing get the edge on us. I think you've been taking these painkillers too long. Here, hold this. Where'd you get these? I'm a doctor. No fooling. Jesus Christ. Oh, no. Oh, no, we're never going to get out of here now, never, never. Hey, look over there. Duke's still alive. These tracks are fresh. Come on. Let's go get Duke. Wait. Look, there might be a radio in that plane that still works. It's worth a look. Go check. Leo and I will go and see if we can spot Duke. OK, but now don't go too fast. I'll catch up with you. RADIO: This is the Leelanau air tower To Duke's charter flight 401. Over. Again, this is Leelanau air tower To Duke's charter flight 401. Do you copy? Come to Poppa, baby. Come to Poppa, radio.

Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Yo, doc. What am I going to do when I run out of these painkillers? It's not the painkillers I'm worried about. It's the whiskey. Wonder where Tony is? Hey! Come on, it's Duke! Holy smokes, it's a dame. What do you mean, dame? That's a woman. That's what I said. Now, come on and help me get her outta here. Come on. Set those down. Say what? What are you going to carry? You gotta take the girl. I gotta go look for Tony. He should have been back by now. Come on! Wait a minute. Come on. First it's the Hoodigo Wendigo, then it's the possessed chili Eats off my hand. Now this hypothermic teenager, what should I expect next? What the Sam Hill you yelling for George? George. [Static crackle] BDFD TV three. You're on the air, Jerry. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Jerry Harrison here in our BDFD news room. We have received word that contact has been lost With Duke's charter flight 401. The plane was piloted by Duke Davis, owner and operator Of the charter service. Some of you may remember Duke from the winter of 1966, When he single-handedly saved a group of hunters From Manitou Island during the severe blizzards Of that same year. We will now switch over live to Harve Lindquist, who is reporting to us from the Leelanau air tower. Harve. Yes, thank you, Jerry. This is Harve Lindquist live at the Leelanau air tower. And with us is Mr. Matt Hell... oh, excuse me. Mr. Hell is the air traffic controller here at the tower. And I understand, Mr. Hell, that you were In contact with Duke Davis. Yes, I was in contact with Duke on his flight Over to the island. And I've continually tried... Yes, bring it right in here, Pal. Nice job. Nice job. Hey, easy on the touch down, there, guy. Easy. Sorry about that. That's quite all right. You were saying. As I was saying, we've had no contact with flight 401 today whatsoever. But you will indeed, continue to try and make contact? Sure, all day. In fact we've been in touch with people in Bedford Falls who Are indeed, putting together a search team to see If they can indeed find Duke. See if he's gone down. And what about passengers? No, unfortunately Duke wasn't very good with passenger Flight records and things. I see. Well that seems to be the story here at Leelanau air tower. So for BDFD TV 3, Action News, this is Have Lindquist. Back to you, Jerry. Thank you, Harve. Terrible situation. We hear at BDFD will keep you up to date With any further developments in this possible tragedy. He's dead. Hey, Peter, He's dead. What? What happened? I was just watching him and he just stopped breathing. I mean, what are we going to do with him, Pete? I don't know. I wish those guys were back with some answers. We aren't going to bury him, are we? I mean, I can't bury my best friend. He was my friend too. We can't just leave him here. He'll start to smell. Maybe we could put him in a box and set it outside. Cold air will freeze him until we get back to town. Hey, no way, man. There's no way I'm putting my best friend in some pine box. Well, what do you want to do? Let him sit here and lose all his body Fluids all over the floor and stink up the entire cabin? Making us all sick until we're outta here? Well I don't. But you do what you want to do. [Crying sounds] Come on. Let's nail this thing shut. We got to get it out of here. It gives me the creeps. [Music playing] I can't do this. I know I gotta but I just can't. Nick, it's OK. Nick. I know you guys were close. Listen, I'll finish up. Why don't you go outside and get some fresh air. [Music playing] [Growling] You let a dead man die? What do you mean, the plane's crashed? It's simple. The plane crashed. Well, where's Tony and Gary? Tony went to look for the plane's radio. When he didn't come back, Gary went to look for Tony. We gotta get out of here. What are you going to do? Walk across the ice? Somebody's going to have to. Are you crazy, man? That's at least a couple of miles. Peter. You all right, man? Who is this? Look out. [Yelling and screaming] Help me! [Gun shot] What's going on? What's going on? Look at my chili. God, there's another one! By your feet. There's another one! [Monster squealing] Get up! [MONSTER SQUEAKING AND SQUEALING] Get it! Get it now! Get it! Shoot it, man! Get him! Get him! [Gun shot] Holy shit! Come on, guys. We gotta figure out what's going on. What do you mean, Pete? It was her those things are after. She's probably the one with the answers. Well, we can play 20 questions later. Right now we got important stuff to do. You're not going across the ice? Well how do you propose we get off the island? Wait until the spring thaw, and swim? Send her across the ice. And let her take those damn little monster with her. She's the one that brought them. Listen, we got... He's right. They are after me. There will be a whole world full of demons if they can stop me. Two worlds have opened into one another. And I've got to stop the Wendigo before it can stop me. Oh, not the Hoodigo again. Somewhere on the island is the gate That connects the two worlds. The gate has been opened and I've Got to find it and close it. She's serious. Dead serious. I need your help. You guys know the island better than I do. Well, maybe you two guys can help her. But right now I gotta get going before it gets too dark. No. Please don't. It's no use. Help me get this thing. Help me find the circle. I'm sorry. But I can't count on what you're saying. It just doesn't make sense. Nothing makes sense. I've gotta go with the only logical means That I can think of getting off this island And that's getting across that lake. And getting some help. He's right. He's wrong. You don't stand a chance. Well, its the only chance I've got. No, it's not. Sorry. I can't believe it. Tony's dead. And better yet, somebody on this island killed him. Choked him to death. If I catch that deranged lunatic that Did this, as if it's not bad enough around here, all ready. Hey! Hey, you. Hello, friend. Look, pal, don't friend me. What do you know about that plane crash over there? And what do you know about that guy next to the plane With a major ring around his collar? I don't know about no plane crash And I don't know about the guy with the dirty shirt. Wise guy, hey? I bet you're the one that axed him. I ought to finish you right here. Wait a minute. Axed him? I don't what you're talking about. I get it. Playing innocent, huh? Let me see your hands. Come on, let me see your hands. OK. They're pretty clean, but that don't mean nothing. You're coming with me. Come on, pal. You look too suspicious. Look here, pal, I'm getting a little bit suspicious of you Too, and I'm tired of this, all right? Me? No look, I haven't done anything. I mean, sure I offed the old guy. But it was an accident, an accident. Ain't you ever done anything by mistake? Anyways, how am I supposed to know the old coot's A keeper for some giant dog from hell? How am I supposed to know? You know what I mean? Sure, monsters in the chili, people Catching on fire, some God damn giant monster in the woods. Sure, blame me. That's it. Blame me. See, I'm a scapegoat. I'm nothing but a scapegoat. And now...

It's either Gary or Tony. Three shots in a row is the distress signal. You going out there? We've got to. I'm coming along. No, you're not. You wait here in case they come back. We'll be gone half an hour. And if we're not back, you can write us off. Then you're on your own. Just grab what you like. When we get back, we'll help you all right. Just a half an hour, man. I don't want to be out there in the dark with all those things. Half an hour. Gary! Tony! Shut up. You want the pigs to hear us? You gotta be quiet, man. The pigs are every place. This is definitely not what I planned when I told Tony I'd come hunting. I swear. You don't have to worry about it anyway. Because out here, we're the ones being hunted. [Crying] Hey, Leo. Over here. What's it going to do? Escape? Sandy! Sandy! Mother? He sent you. The Guardian sent you. Shh. I'm here now. That's all that matters. Let's go inside. I need to talk to you. I'm here to help you. Hey, buddy, you all right? Say, mister. Hey, buddy. You all right? Hey, fella. Say something. [Retching] Oh, my god. They tore him in half. And they ate the skin off his face. They're cannibals. They ate the skin off his face. It's not Gary. It's not him. Let's get the hell out of here. Wait, wait. I gotta stop. Come on, man. We got to make it back before she locks us out Here all night. Come on, Nick. You are the Chosen One. It can't be me. I'm not strong enough, Mother. But dear, you do have much strength. No, I don't. Some of which you've shown already. I don't even understand it. How can I stop it? How can I stop it? Shh. It's OK. No. (MONSTER VOICE) It's OK. (HIGH MONSTER VOICE) It's OK. [Crying] It's OK. [Roaring] No! Mother! (SCREAMING)No! No! [Roaring] Love you too, daughter. I'm not your daughter! We will defeat you. We will defeat you. [Gun shot] I'm melting! I'm melting. I'm melting. [Wolf howl] Listen, listen. The thing doesn't howl, does it? I don't know. The Hoodigo Wendigo gets nothing out from me. Come on, Nick. Nick, come on. Nick, come on. Come on. [Screaming] What happened out there? I went back to the crash. Tony was dead. Somebody had crushed his neck. Where you going? I've gotta find the circle. What? The only way to stop the Wendigo Is to close the sacred circle. I know what it is and where it is too. So you mean you're the one those things are after. You gotta take me there. And we gotta go now. It's all making sense. You're the one. [Crash] Where's the circle? On the other side of the island. [Growling] It's a couple miles. It's a circle. Let's go. [Growling] Gary, Wake up. What is it? What kind of circle? It's a circle of skulls. But I broke it. [Crash] [Growling] [Gun shot] Sandy! What are you doing? Falling. Gary, help me! [Screaming] Help me! Help! [Screaming] Put me down! I can't get warm. You've lost control of your body temperature. It's way below normal. Don't exert any energy. It only makes it harder to bring up. You're suffering from hypothermia. I'm cold. Relax No. No. Slow your breathing. Shh. Slow your breathing. No. Warm up. Please. Warm up. [Gasping] [Screaming] No! Sandy. It broke my arms. [Screaming] My arms of ice. Now look. Look into my eyes. [Screaming] Eyes of the Wendigo. [Screaming] [Screaming] [Gun shot] [Growling] [Gun shot] [Screaming] You OK? We've got to leave. Every minute we wait, the Wendigo grows. We've got to hurry. We might be too late already. What the hell is going on out there? Those are my friends. They're not anymore. They're just as much the Wendigo as the Wendigo itself. It controls their bodies. They crave human flesh. They're cannibals. [Crash] Gary! Burn! Let's go. You gotta help me. I tried to get away. It didn't help. No, not away. To the other side of the island. We've got to find the circle of skulls. And I'm afraid we have to do it before morning. Before morning? It's almost morning now. I can feel the Wendigo's power growing. By morning, he'll be free of the circle, free to move and grow. Well, what's that supposed to mean? Armageddon. Wendigo will start small. Then death will rise. Then demons will emerge from the bowels of the earth. Don't shoot us, Peter. We can't help what happened. We can't help what we crave. We're victims. Just like you. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot. We're your friends. We're your God damn friends. We're your friends. [Gun shot] Let's go. [Thundering] [Hissing] [Explosion] What is it? It happened. The gate has been opened. The Wendigo is at full strength. I seem to be losing mine. That's it. That's the circle. There's the break. There's got to be another source somewhere. I've got to find it. Where? In there. [Growling] [Roaring] We can't go in there. What about that thing? [Roaring] He can't touch me. No! Sandy! Don't go in there! Come back! Don't! [Explosion] [Growling] Hey, you ugly son of a bitch! Over here! Whoa! [Static crackling] [Roaring] She defeated you. No. No. [Screaming] OTHER WORLDLY VOICE: No, She has defeated you. The gate to your world is closing. Go with it. The battle is over. Then you will die. Sandy. You must join me. I cannot stop it. Stand up. Sandy. You have the power. Join me. We must stop the Wendigo. [Static crackling] [Explosion] Don't be afraid. Never be afraid. You have defeated the evil and you are free to go for now. But remember, the Wendigo's spirit only rests. And there may come a day when you area called upon again. [Roaring] [Music playing]
