I like your dress. Oh, do you? You know it's a great pity your attitude isn't as charming as your voice. Are you so certain about my attitude? I'd like to be. Well how about you, I think it's your turn to carry out this ancient and delightful custom. Are you afraid? I'm not afraid of any customs. Good. # Joys untold # # Drink drink drink # Quit running away! Why are you running after me? 'Cause I want to, that's a good reason isn't it? So you won't kiss me hey? Why not? 'Cause you don't love me. I see, but you love me don't you? If you let my hands I'll tell you. Alright. I changed my mind, I won't tell you. Whatever you've done I'm going to kiss you. If you don't let me go I'll scream. Go ahead then scream. I'll scream again if you don't. Oh no, no listen, the night's much too beautiful to spend it screaming, innit? What's your name? Nikolai. Nikolai. I'm Maria. Maria I'll meet you tomorrow night at 10 o'clock at the corner of the wood, and I'll bet you'll be there! This is the first real party I've been to for ages. Hey they'll be here in a minute. Who do you want to dance with? The Captain of course if I get the chance. Why should you always have the best? Which do you like most? I can't stand calvary, they always smell of horses. Their the guards silly, the finest regiment in Russia. Can I have a word with you? I want you to take the opportunity tonight my dear of entertaining Captain Olinsky. You know how I feel, and I'm sure you'll do as I ask. Both our families are anxious to see you and Nikolai are married. I know your affection for Torsenberg. He's a nice boy but. Greetings. Nice to see you again. How are you sir? Glad to see you my boy. Yoo hoo! Yoo hoo! Yoo hoo! I'm kind of famished. Tonight? That's because you're here Torsenberg. I wish I were always here. Don't forget what I asked you to do. Yes father. Excuse me Torsenberg. I'll come back. My father wants me to see that you're entertained. I'm at your disposal. My dear lady you flatter me. I didn't expect such. You know handle it. Why? 'Cause everyone expect us to be friends. Of course in that case you dislike me intensely. No, not dislike, but I don't think we have very much in common, do you? I shouldn't have said that, come on let's dance. Hello. Oh I do admire Captain Olinsky. Do you think Olga will marry him? If I had my day over again I would. Hello Shariat, you're going to leave? Yes sir, thank you sir. May I congratulate you on your marriage? You may, you can stand at ease as well, you're not on parade now you know. Tell me you live in this village? No sir, but my future wife does. Well, when are you gonna be married. As soon as I finish my service sir, and when we've saved enough money. Is she with you? Yes sir, the one in the middle. The prettiest one sir. So it's you. Yes, we don't seem to be able to avoid each other do we? You're exactly the same aren't you. Why now, you expect me to have grown old. So this is your wedding day? Yes. I hope, that you will be very happy. And to father, and to mother, and to uncle, and to Boris, and to Elizabeth, and to Catherine, and to Peter. That's enough, I've done enough writing for a glass of vodka. What do you mean enough, I have mentioned half the family yet? They'll be insulted. That's right. I've got it, listen and greetings to you all, including the cows and pigs. Good. And now one to my girl, tell Maria, to hurry and pack her things because the job I've got for her is a good one, that's all. What, nothing about love and kisses? That's alright, I'll do that myself when she arrives. Sign it. Good morning. Good morning. Could you please tell me if Jakob Sharev is here? I want to see him because, oh, I beg your pardon. Oh Jakob, Jakob I've just got here. Oh how nice to see you again, you look very well too. How smart you are Jakob, aren't you glad to see me? Aren't you glad to see me? Stand back, I can't talk to you now, can't you see that I'm on guard. Go away will you. Where should I go, you wrote to me, you told me to come, you said you got a job for me so I came and now you are chasing me away? What's wrong Jakob? See that cafe over the road? Yes. I'll meet you there in two hours, now hop it. Alright. There, don't make a meal of that sugar. Well my little one, I'm terribly glad to see you. You funny little one, don't you understand that when a soldier's on guard he's forbidden to talk to strangers, don't you? But I'm not a stranger to you, they can't permit you to talk to me? Well there are a lot of things you don't understand, my girl, but you'll learn, waiter. Coming sir. I'll show you that I'm glad to see you I'll give you something you've never had in your life. What is it? Bring two cognacs. Two cognacs, yes sir. Oh, Jakob. Now tell me how you are, did you have a good journey? Wonderful, I travelled in a train. Ah, the cognac. You know how to drink it? Of course I do. And here's to your pretty face and your new job. There, there steady, steady, you can't drink brandy like that, couldn't come in a vodka silly one. I'll show you how to drink it. See. What's the difference if you get drunk anyway? I told you you had a lot to learn, waiter? Yes sir. Bring two more cognacs. Two more cognacs. Oh, I'm learning. Oh, before I forget your Uncle Herium and your Uncle Akaki asked to be remembered, and cross-eyed Perform and talk McMuffin send their greetings to, and Ivana Flusser. Oh, they have had a cutest baby. You like babies don't you? I adore them. Then you'll like the job I got for you. Oh Jakob darling, tell me, tell me what it is? You're going to be a nurse. Nurse, why a nurse. I knew you would you'll like Madame too, she's class I tell you. How did you get this for me? I applied for it, she's the wife of my company officer, don't you remember Olinsky's wedding? Oh. Well, what's up? Nothing. Yes, there is, you don't. Well she'll be too grand for me I'm afraid. Oh Jakob, I couldn't live in her house, I couldn't. You're going to my girl, whether you want to or not. I don't want to be in her house. You don't seem to know what you want. Let me go home, Jakob, please let me. After all the trouble I've taken to get you here, nonsense my pigeon, here you are in the same town with me and here you stop. Take baby now will you? I'm tired. Now let me look at you, you don't look so bad. I like my servants to be well turned out. Lucia must you be so long with that cap? Do you want all day? Oh, you want everything done at once Madame, and I've only got one pair of hands. Don't irritate me Lucia, I'm very ill. There now, how's that? It doesn't fit, well you couldn't make a baby's nappy. Now hold your head straight, now down, no up. Oh it isn't your cap, it's your hair. You'll have to change the way you do it, now put that child down, come over here. Now Maria, hurry up. Lucia give me the curling tongs. Oh come back here Lucia, come back, aren't you're the most annoying woman I've ever known? Can't say, you know so many Madame. Now hold that Lucia. That's straight. There you see how much better that is? There's no comparison, look Lucia. Beg pardon? Telephone am I going mad? I hope not Madame for our sakes as well as yours. Leave that thing along and get out of my room. Hello, hello? Oh Tosenberg, how nice to hear your voice. You were the new nurse. Yes. I hope you like being here. Oh Nicky, ah there you are. Nicky I say, what about the new mare? Tony. Hi. Hello. Jakob's come to see you. Where is he? In the kitchen deary, where'd you think he'd be, in the drawing room? He'd look better than some of he people I've seen in there. Oh Jakob, Jakob, I'm so glad you've come. I'm off duty for an hour Maria, can you get out for a bit? I'll try to, I'll ask Madame as soon as she's finished here, but let's sit down, let's sit down for a minute and talk. So tell me what you've been doing? Oh the usual, nothing much, but we can't talk here, can't you slip out without. Madame's taking some of us swell trainers to see a baby and wants you upstairs. Wait for me, I won't be a moment. But I've got to be back in an hour can't you tell her that? My darling sleep, so that one day you'll grow into a big, strong man like your daddy. I'd like you to grow up like him. Do you know why? 'Cause he's a fine man, and a clever man, daddy yes, yes your daddy. And everybody admires him, everybody respects him, everybody. I beg your pardon. There's no need to do that. I'm sorry if I scared you. No you didn't I, I was telling a story to your son. There you are lad. No thanks I'm not hungry. Oh come now, this is not kitchen cake I pinched it from the drawing room. I came here to talk to Maria this hanging about makes me crazy. Now in a job like this you're never off duty. So it seems. Maria stands a very good chance in this house. Chance of what? Getting on of course. Getting off I'd say. What do you mean? You keep your eyes open and you'll find out. Turning much of your form Nicky. It's too hot for billiards. Let's just play Nicky we haven't got all night. If he hasn't got his mind on the game you better check him. Well, wherever you're going. Let's go to the gypsy restaurant, the food's. Oh who cares about food, what about drink? Oh tonight I'm gonna drink champagne. Well why are you looking like that, without your vest, don't you want to come with us? Nothing would give me greater pleasure. You might look a little enthusiastic, I don't want you to make a favour of it. Don't bully a mugger. You might look a little pleased at the prospect of taking me out. I am very pleased. I'm not sure if I want you to now. It wouldn't be a bad idea if you made up your mind. Oh if you're in that sort of mood I'd much rather be with Tosenberg and Alachal. Well in that case you shall be, I'll eat here. Come on. Get board with your own company! You behaving yourselves since we just saw you last? I'm very happy tonight. Because we are together? Mm hmm. Tosenberg, I think you understand me better than most people. I want you to be happy. Lucky for you there isn't a bull among them. I like your dress. Oh do you? You little devil you're not gonna get away. Tonight's much to beautiful to spend screaming. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. They have gone away. Well you should've answered quicker it might've been important. I'm sorry. Now go back to your room. Maria, why do you torment me like this? I don't understand you. Why did you come here? I didn't want to come, I didn't ask to come. Oh, please let me go. I'll never let you go, 'cause I love you. You must understand. No, please don't say it, I know what you're going to say, I quite realise what I'm doing, I know it's madness. I've tried to fight. Oh please, please don't talk like that. Madame wants to speak to you on the telephone sir. Alright, put her through. Holy mother, holy mother help me, help me with my trouble. Give me your guidance I pray you. Why do you look at me like that? I didn't want to hurt anyone, do not blame me, but give me your help, give me strength to understand myself give me strength to understand this love, do not punish me, teach me, I pray you, teach me to do what is right. Holy mother, I pray you holy mother. I now know why you look at me like that. I know what I should do. May I speak to you Madame? Yes. What is it? I can't stay here any longer. What are you talking about, you can't leave me now, that's absurd, what's the matter with you? You've been very kind to me Madame but I must go. I won't let you go, I won't, do you understand? How dare you even suggest such a thing after all I've done for you! Nicky, Nicky! Oh no please, that won't make any difference, I must go! Who are you to detect me you do as I tell you, you ungrateful little fool, here I've given you a decent home, Nicky, Maria wants to leave! She hasn't got a reason, she doesn't making things difficult for me. I have a very good reason Madame, if you will let me explain. Alright. I'm going to be married. In that case Olga I think she'd better go immediately. Morning. Morning, what's your news? Nothing much, hey don't count that flash. Got to look smart when you call to see your girl. You're girl? What do you mean? Well if you want to know. Maria, Jakob's here. Whatever is the matter deary? I'm alright. Well you are the only one who doesn't know. You lie, I'll shake the life out of you you rat. It isn't true, say it or I'll strangle you! Say it, say it! I heard him, making love to her. Was she making love to him? Was she making love to him? Yes. Oh Jakob, Jakob! Oh Jakob, oh I'm so glad you've come I wanted to see you so badly, what's the matter with you? You wanted to see me, what for? It's only natural that I should want to isn't it? You haven't made much effort so far. Jakob darling, you know that it wasn't all my fault. Madame made me work very hard. And the Captain keeps you pretty busy also. Doesn't he? What do you mean? What do I mean, you don't know what I mean, you dirty. Jakob, Jakob. The whole of this house knows about you. You're mad, you don't know what you're talking about. Last night he sent his wife out to a party so that he could be alone with you, didn't he? He didn't, it's a lie. I don't want your explanations, I know the truth. Jakob. The porter found you both in the same room, he heard him say I love you, is that true? You don't deny it because it is true. You thought I was going to marry you, well I'm not, I've had enough of you and I'm through, you hear, I'm through! Goodbye Lucia. Goodbye Maria, bless you, we shall all miss you deary. Poor child. Don't worry about me Lucia, I can look after myself. That's tonight. Paris, are you taking me? Yes, of course I am. Oh Madame, Paris, I knew a lovely Frenchman when I was 18, I wonder. Do not stand there doing nothing, pack up my things! Why are we leaving in such a hurry? Mind your own business. Master coming? Stop asking questions, will you stop asking questions? What's the matter with you? Stand to attention. Now present. Look out sir! Captain! Shariat, you'll be arrested for attacking a superior officer. Arrest that man. I'll take him to the guard room. The guard room quick, March! Change the guard. What's this? We found this on the guard, a revolutionary pamphlet. Right now. Where'd you get this, who gave it to you? Nobody sir, I picked it up myself, they were scattered in the courtyard. And why didn't you deliver it to your superior officer? I'm sorry sir I didn't know it was important. I couldn't know what it was, I can't read. Nonsense, you would've gotten somebody else to read it for you, who was it? No sir. What do you mean no sir? Answer my question who read this paper to you? I'm sorry sir I mean nobody sir. I didn't show it to anyone, I thought it was just scrap paper. Then why'd you pick it up and put it in your pocket? To use for rolling cigarettes sir. A very convenient idea, and suddenly you change your mind and attacked Captain Olinsky? I did it because he tried to steal my girl. Something's happened. What? Nicky has been attacked, one of his men tried to. Who did it? The man your nurse was engaged to. I knew something dreadful would happen, oh why did I ever have her in my house? Keep calm. Calm, I won't stop here another second, why should I stay here and face this scandal? Where are you going. I shall go to my father. After that I'm going to get my divorce. Cigarette paper, how would you like to smoke this brand of cigarettes? I'm afraid it would be too explosive it. Yes, this propaganda is dangerous, we must stamp out this unrest without hesitation. The case of Jakob Shariat will serve us with an example. But in his case we cannot be exactly sure that his defence of jealousy cannot be justified. I've heard rumours. Nonsense this is purely a political case. There might be some truth in it. It will and must be stopped. Quite certainly, but the whole case hinges upon the correct evidence from Captain Olinsky and the girl. Leave it to me my dear major, I will summon the girl immediately, and interview her myself. She's just a peasant girl. And Captain Olinsky, will he verify it? In his position, he will give me every support. Yes, yes I know about that, but you must understand the truth, this crime is nothing more or less than a political one. No, if I may say so sir, this attack on me has no political significance whatever. But you will present yourself when they found this pamphlet? Yes, at the same time it is my belief that he attacked me for quite a different reason. It was jealousy. Yes, I know that's his defence, does he have any grounds for making it? Well sir the girl he was going to marry was employed by me he may have imagined. Exactly he may have imagined something. Was there any ground for his suspicion? Yes, sir. You flirted with the girl no doubt. It was more than that sir. Yes I know, was she your mistress? No sir. That's all I want to know. I have prepared a statement and I want you to sign it. Listen, I deny the charge made by Jakob Shariat that the woman Maria Krasnova was my mistress. In my opinion the attempt on my life was made for political reasons. But I have no proof sir! Captain Olinsky, you have my word, do you disbelieve me? No sir. Then sign. The case will proceed, along with the lines indicated. Come in. Are you Maria Krasnova? Yes. Were you ever employed in the house of Olinsky? Yes I was. You were? Well, if this isn't my lucky day. Here we are. What is this untidy thing? Well if you'd spent 18 months in my pocket you'd be a bit untidy yourself, it is a summon. What for? You're called as a witness in the case of high treason against a soldier by the name of Jakob Shariat. Jakob? Yes, sign please. Nicky! Hey there Nicky, walking around this place is like spending Saturday afternoon in the graveyard. Come on you old devil, let's play 100 up. No thanks. Oh, it's like that is it? It's like what? Look here Nicky you've got to pull yourself together. Oh leave me alone will you. Not until I've got some sense out of you, I'm talking to you as your best friend now. Why everyone from the General downwards have noticed how much you've walked. Why should I care what they've noticed? You've got to care man! You've got a grand future before you, don't chuck it away. Why did I sign that statement? Because it was the truth. Oh no, it was really a lie, and that man's going to his death because I signed it. He's going to his death because he attacked you. Yes, but why did he attack me? Because he was a revolutionary. Oh rot! Now let me at least be honest with you if with nobody else, he didn't break the law I did, I stole his woman that's the oldest law in the world. Well, my most charming young lady won't you sit down? Thank you. And to think that only a few nights ago I was in the theatre admired you're dancing very much indeed, I never imagined you were the person we were looking for, why did you change your name? Why did you hide yourself? I didn't know you were looking for me. I left before it happened. Why does he want to see you again? I don't know, I wish he'd hurry up though. But what about Jakob Shariat, what has he done? Tell me everything. He made an attempt on the life of his superior officer. Captain Olinsky? Yes. So, what made him do that? Oh just a bit of political enthusiasm as we found out. Jakob, political, oh it's impossible. I know Jakob well enough to tell you that that he, that he had no idea about politics, he was never interested in them, oh it's ridiculous, what has he said to that? The crazy fellow tried to persuade us that he did it out of jealousy, of course that's absurd. He had no proof whatsoever, no, no, it's clearly a political matter. You don't believe me, read this. The charge made by Jakob Shariat, that the woman Maria Karsnova was my mistress, in my opinion the attempt on my life was made for political reasons, Nikolai Olinsky. So that's how it is? Before you came in I thought we might meet some ignorant peasant girl who might make things difficult for us. In what way? Well if you support Jakob Shariat, that he was actuated by jealousy it means the end of. Captain Olinsky's career, and of course we're also in a position to make it the end of your career. Show the lady out. Yes sir. Good day. And don't forget what I said to you. Maria, I've got to talk to you, well can't you spare me a moment? Maria, why don't you answer me? I hate you. 595. This way. You. You've been a long time coming. I wanted to come before, as soon as I heard, but I couldn't get permission. I've come to tell you that you mustn't be afraid of the trial tomorrow everything will be alright. And after it's over, even if I have to wait a little, I'll wait for you, we'll be together again, we'll start a new life together. Oh shut up. What do you think I am blind? Look at yourself, your dress, your whole style, everything, and what about your profession? If I get off and go back to the village I'm gonna get a decent girl for a wife, you hear? A decent girl I said! I don't want your pity either, you didn't come here to help me, you came here to show me how grand you are. Who asked you to come here? I don't regret that I came here Jakob. I understand you. We've never understood each other. You are right, we must look like each other in ourselves, when I said I would wait for you I meant it, and I will wait, if you want me still? Do you think I want another man's? You are mistaken Jakob I never was. Ah that makes no difference to me now. I wanted to kill him because I was jealous. I hated him, but I wouldn't do it now, because I don't love you anymore. You see Maria, I've had plenty of time to think things over and I know now that we don't belong to each other, you aren't the same Maria that I knew in the village, you aren't meant for me. Oh I don't blame you much now because I don't care. But I want to tell you that that swine Olinsky played a dirty trick on me and if you. You're unjust Jakob. Olinsky's a good man. Maria you said we mustn't lie to each other. Alright, you love him don't you? Yes I do. Then that settles it. Yes, yes, yes, the court is not interested in your love affair, you are charged with a very serious crime, you tell us the motive was jealousy, I tell you it was nothing of the sort, for the 10th time I ask you to explain this! I can't. It was in your possession. Yes, I found it! Found it an incitement to mutiny? I know nothing about it. An engaging innocence. The court will form its own opinion. Gentlemen, you have heard the prisoner's evidence. His accusation against Captain Olinsky was founded on what? The gossip of the half-witted porter. You have heard this witness examined by the defending counsel and cross-examined by me. I think you will agree that the testimony was not impressive and against it we have three things. This incriminating document found in the prisoners possession, and the most audacious piece of mischief I have never read. To my mind it is conclusive, as I believe it will be to yours. We have also Captain Olinsky's signed statement, he is a man of honour. You will be able to weigh his word against the prisoner's. And last I shall submit to you the evidence of Maria Krasnova the celebrated artist, a lady on this banner heavy impedance to produce in the hope of saving his skin. I the courts to call Maria Krasnova. Call Maria Krasnova. Order in the court! Maria Krasnova! Your name? Maria Krasnova. Your age? 20. Married or single? Single. Proceed counsellor. You are Maria Krasnova, the celebrated dancer? I am the dancer. You know the prisoner? Yes. You were engaged to him. Yes. You know Captain Olinsky? Yes. You were employed in his house? Yes. Quite so, now, as to the prisoner, you know that he is charged with a very serious crime, an assault on Captain Olinsky? In his defence he shamelessly says that the motive was your association with Captain Olinsky. He says that, I know. Where as we believe, I may say we know, it would have been political. This pamphlet, you have seen it? Yes. Right, now I want you to tell the court what you know of the prisoner's political activities in such matters. His activities? Yes, oh come, you know this man well? Very well. Well then you must know something of his political opinion? Jakob has no opinions. Come, come, we understand your reluctance, but I'm afraid you must tell me. Tell you what? Maria Krasnova you are a an intelligent woman. Thank you. And this is a court of justice I'm glad. If you please, again, what knowledge have you of the prisoners political activities? None. Jakob knows no more about politics than a coal. Then how do you explain this? I don't, in any case you could make nothing of it. He cannot read. That has nothing to do with it. I see. Obviously someone else could read it for him. Obviously, but even then he wouldn't understand it. That's your opinion. Of an intelligent woman I think you said. Well perhaps I was mistaken. Now let us turn to a matter in which your intelligence is not at stake, to a matter of fact within your knowledge. You know that the prisoner has accused you of an intrigue with your employer, you know that Captain Olinsky denies it. I know. And you deny this intrigue? Well you see. Yes or no? But it's not so easy for me. It is perfectly easy to speak the truth. That is just what is not easy. Nonsense! The prisoner has said shameful things about you. My information is that you deny them, I ask you to confirm it! I see no difficulty here. I do not wish to confirm it. You do not wish to, what are you talking about? You don't seem to understand it is suggested that you were your employer's mistress! I know. What do you mean you know, will you answer my question yes or no? Very well then, yes. I was his mistress. This is outrageous! Mistress. Gentlemen, I apologise to you for insulting you with this woman's evidence. The court must have been insane to rely on this drab of a dancer, a common property with no morals. Stop it, stop it I tell you! Captain Olinsky, this statement it is your evidence placed before the court, repeat it! That statement was a lie. What she says is true. Clear the court. Clear the court! In the name of his majesty the Czar and the purity of regulations this court will try the case of Private Jakob Shariat. The court after careful consideration has decided to take a lenient view, we sentence you to two years imprisonment, but taking into account the time you've already spent in detention, you are free. Call Captain Olinsky. Captain Olinsky. You held the regiment up to ridicule, not to say dishonour. For such an officer there is no place in the service. Your resignation will be accepted. Maria, why did you say that in there? 'Cause in our hearts, it was true.
