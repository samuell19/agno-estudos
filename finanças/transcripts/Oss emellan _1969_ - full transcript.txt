He's over there! Here he is. Here he is! Hooray for the police force! Here! Here he is! Here! - Just a moment! Here... I have him. Here he is! - Where is he? - I don't know. Here he is! Here he is! Over here! This way. Sorry... hullo! Hullo! Might I make a suggestion... Search to the right! To the right! Since you do not want to give us your name you'll just have to sit in the cell there and wait. You just might be an escapee who's wanted. Alright... name's Olofson. Olofson.... Other names? - Per. - First name? Per... Per Olofson. No others? You don't have any identification? - What do you want? - Drivers licence? Or passport? Come on! Hi. Sorry I'm late. How are you then? I've only managed to get... ...two and a half metres again. - Here. - Where did you buy it? In town. Sorry I'm late, but I was in custody. Which hand? That one . No, wait... You get that one and you, that one. You were in custody? Look... this you can catch big pike with... Huge pike.. This one you catch huge pike with.. - No, you can't at all! - Yes, you can! I'll show you how you do it. You go and buy something that's shiny... So you pull this... Then you catch a huge pike. Do you want this? Stop whinging! - Why did you only buy...? - They were out. There weren't any more. I was sitting in a police station. - Why? - Because I had long hair. You have to realise that it attracts attention. Yes, I quite accept that. I entered into a dialogue with a couple of gentlemen. They didn't consider it appropriate to have long hair. They said they'd call the police, and that they did. Then we had some fun. We ran around a bit. I darted away. I thought it was ridiculous, so I fooled around with them a bit. Such is life. But you were released, obviously. Maria! Do you think Dad's stupid to look like this... with long hair? Should Dad be locked up for that? I want that one! You can watch Bomans for a while. I want it! I want to borrow it. Take this for now. Jeez, what are you doing, Lina?! What are you doing? You cage us in here... Have you thought about the temporary position at the school, with your long hair? Can that work out? People talk about it if you look different. What's your motivation? For the students... What you are fighting! I thrive in this hair. Can't I be a teacher and look like this? I have a beret, too. Have you decided? About what? The school. I don't have to decide today. Do we have to, for money's sake? You know very well. I'll sleep on it. "...at the polygenetic historical level." "The artistic imagination shapes..." Listen! This is good stuff "Under the dominance of performance criticism, art sets against its..." It's so good I can't see! "The institutionalized repression..." "of the image of the man who..." Look out! I'm going fast. You're not. There's bread in the basket. Lie down. Earlobe, too! You have such thick hair. Watch out for the nails, Boman. - Only on one! - What's this? - Hi, is this your dog? - Nelson! Thank you. - What are doing? - Tearing the fence down. - Can I join in? - A friend of revolution! - What's your name? - Christina. Maria, Lina, Boman... Revolutionaries. - Where are you from? - Angelholm. Do you have a revolution there? No, we'll have to get one going. Careful, Maria. - I'll get some juice. - Lemonade! - Hello. - Hello, teacher. - That dog belongs here. - I know. - What on earth are you doing? - Tearing down the fence. I think you should stop... No, you have to stop... Stop it! Do you know whose fence it is? Yes, it belongs to the man who lives here. And me. And I'm asking you to stop. Do you know tearing down implies? Yes I know. That's why I'm ripping down the fence. I'll get you a glass. You needn't get a glass. What a spectacle. I guess it was you who started it, not her. Tearing down the fence? We talked about me doing it. YOU talked about it. You disagreed, but surely it's symbolic for me to do it? So our dog and little children can go running out onto the street?! We'll put up a sign... "Playing children." No one will take any notice. There were signs on the fence. Do you know what you've done? There were location signs for water and electricity. We can get a water diviner's fork. Diviner's fork? Stop being childish! You don't know what this means! It's not worth getting angry about. Do you know what it means for us? The dog? This is my husband. He has to keep track of his dog. Of course... I just thought... When you see a fence... There's a reason to have a fence... It sort of says... "We want something of our own, be for ourselves. " Shall the doors be open all the time too? Have a constant draught through the house! Of course you can have the door open. When you close the door, the draught stops. You have to ring first. What's it going to cost to have it put back together? I won't have any more wine, either. Like some wine? Why not? No, we'll put the kids to bed. Have some wine. Why? I've correcting to do. I don't have time. I need wine today. Have you heard this story? There was an old man who wanted to get a new suit. So he went to his tailor. When he got home, he said to his wife... "Don't you think it's a good suit?" His wife said "The shoulders don't sit right" So he went back to the tailor. The tailor said "Keep your arms like this and it won't fold forward." "Is it good now?" he asked his wife. "No, it's creasing in the back" "Tailor, it's creasing in the back." "Walk like this and it'll go away." So he went home, and she said... - I don't have time for this. - I'm taking the kids later. ..."but admit, he was a very good tailor." Who'll be in bed first? Boman, then. No, come here now. Bye then. See you, Barbel. - I'll call you tomorrow. - Do that. - Boman! - Why are you flicking water?! You're in a bad mood! What is it? Aren't you happy? - No. - Why? You go and borrow money, from Aage. It was necessary. - Why? - For the workshop. You can tell me first. Here he was asking me for 100 kronor. Get undressed now. I can't always be asking you for money. No, you don't need to... but you can at least talk to me about it... ...that you're borrowing money from Aage. Here he comes asking for 100 kronor that I know nothing about. - Did he get it? - Obviously. It's not that much. It's nothing to get angry about. I'm coming, Boman! Come here! I can't be running upstairs... ...every time you want to ask a question.. - Are you in your pyjamas? - Yes. My shoes are still on. Per, I think you use a bit more care in choosing your friends. - Which friends? - Everyone, including Aage. What's wrong with him? He's a nice guy, isn't he? - Nice...? - You liked him before. What's the matter now? We can talk about it later. This is not the time. You can go to bed now. I want Mummy to read a fairy story! Mummy will do that in the morning. - Read! - Daddy doesn't feel up to reading. - Boman, get into bed. - I'm reading. Get into bed, Boman! Boman, get into bed. Do it now! No. Get into bed, I said! I'm serious! What's all the fuss about? You help then... I haven't the strength. You want me to be nice to you... But you aren't the least bit nice to me. Daddy can also get tired. I shouldn't have done that. I was wrong. You get tired and angry sometimes, too, and hit Maria or Lina. Daddy feels like that sometimes, and forgets himself. You could read a fairy story though, couldn't you? I'll just read one page. Why only one? You know how to read more. Yes, but I don’t feel up to reading it all. "Barbar and Celeste have a terrible experience on their honeymoon" "They end up on a cannibal island." I'll read tomorrow. Per, tell Maria to go to bed. Maria! Come into bed. You go out... I'll do this. Come here. Get off the bed... Come on! Go and lie down. Lie down. Sleep tight. I want Mummy here! Stop that... You're to be quiet and go to sleep! Mummy and Daddy are tired too. We're going to bed. Come on Barbel, shut the door. Sleep tight! Good night! Pleasant dreams! Shut the door. You can take care of them... I've had enough. God, what this looks like! - Nelson was lying there. - It's not just Nelson. What did you say that Aage had done? What he did? He was drunk today. Daddy, you have to rub my foot. Why? It hurts. I can't just do everything you want. Go back to bed. Go back to bed, I said! Otherwise I'm closing the door. What do YOU work at all the time? You're always tired, too? I don't take on more than you do, do I? Of course we're tired. What did Aage do? Mummy! Mummy! Go to sleep now! If you're not quiet, I'll close the door! I will! No! Wide open! No, like this... Some light. Like always. Did he come on to you? - What? - Come on to you? Call it what you like. He came in, carrying on... firstly about the money... Then he started... What did he do? He didn't behave like someone who's been visiting for years. - Did he touch your breasts? - No... But he demanded that... He said, did he, that he wanted you in bed? Yes. What is it? Did he force you onto the bed? No. I managed to stop him. Bloody hell! Yes, it's pretty sad. He was drunk... but no excuse... It's happened before, like that. With him? No, I mean generally. It's not nice, but it does happen. Have you done it? Me?! No. - You said it's happened before. - It happens every day. Everywhere. Sure, you get over it, but it's most unpleasant. The Vietnam Bulletin, 1 krona! Would madam like a Vietnam Bulletin? Why is there nothing about the Czechs? Don't you react against that! Well, the second day after the invasion, the Angelholm Vietnam Committee... were first to publish leaflets about it, and attacked the Soviet Union... But when it comes to the government, they're weak at attacking the Russians. Have you demonstrated for Czechoslovakia? No, it's hard for us out in the country. Although they've helped us, and we should be grateful for that... But when they're engaged in genocide in Vietnam, we shouldn't shut up. There are two major power blocs which we must fight. But not just by taking on one of them. You're just attacking the USA. - Yes, and so it will remain. - But then... - You can't just take on one. - It depends on how you look at it. You can take on one, but then you don't need... It depends. - A Lars-Erik production. - What have you got there? A really nice frame. I see you're wearing a tie today. What do you have here? Give us a fucking look at it at least! What? I can see it, can't I? I'm going to sell the painting. I've never seen you wearing a tie. Shut up! Fuck what I'm wearing! Are you doing anything? I sold it... That's why you have a tie. What a frame! Did you paint it yourself? I'll tell you a story about it. About the painting? Nice piece of work. Shut up! You'll hear the story. I met this bird down in Fontainebleau. We were hitchhiking... Fontainebleau... What sort of bird? Shut your gob and I'll tell the story. I'll buy the frame off you. I hitchhiked with her. She was a medical student and studied in Paris. We hitchhiked and I stayed at her place for a fortnight. In Fontainebleau? She lived in Paris. You know the drill. Can we see it now? This bird... I was living with her and one day, I was desperate for a shit. - One day I was desperate for a shit. - One out of 14. Just listen. Anyway...so I went... She wasn't there. So I went upstairs, looking everywhere. Anyway... I went up to the attic and found this bird. And there? I was so desperate. You had a shit in the attic? Yes, and when I was finished... And you should have 800 for... "Robber". Do you mean it's not yours, or what do you mean? Anyway after all that, I sat there for a while. Then I had a look around. Then I found this old thing in this frame, and I took it with me. I took it with me, and since then I've done some work on it. There are some models here that... That what? Some ballet dancers... And other stuff... up there.... I painted over it... Leave it alone! I sold the damned thing. Ballet dancers? It could be a Degas. Scrape it and you'll see. Miss! Some punch... and a bottle of thinners. And a rag! - Don't scrape it now. - Aren't you happy? Can't you give a damn about this thing? I'll get 800 for it. More, lad. Just wait and see. Be careful of the frame! You were a bastard to me. You might go home with a Degas! Then you don't have to go to that guy. Look! Here comes Degas. Now... wait! It's not a Degas. - Damn it. - It was a near thing. - It's probably no Degas. - It was... It's not a Degas. 800 down the drain! I'm sick and tired of you lot. You can have my glass. There could've been money here. There's 800 kronor that you... It might have been 80,000. You're all fucking talk. At least we take a chance, Benke. Year. Maria, hurry up! Put it there, then. We are in a terrible hurry. Look for it... It must be somewhere. Have you picked up your stuff? Oh, there's Daddy. At this time! Find it! Hurry up! Let go of the handle and I’ll open it. You love still love me, don't you? You know I'm in a hurry. I'm really sorry, but I... Nelson, come on! You're going now. Put your jacket on. Sorry I'm a bit late. I don't have time. We'll talk later. It's probably an "inclination party". What? Have you learned something new now?! Do you know what stratification is? No. This is not a prerogative I have. I'm in such a hurry now. But in no hurry to love your husband. Have a nice day! Bella! 'Bye, Boman!... 'Bye, Maria! 'Bye, Nelson. I can take care of Lina. I can see to Lina... I'm home now. Mrs Karlsson has promised to take care of her. You look after the dog. Come on, we really need to hurry. Is there a sandwich for me? Lina! Look after the dog. If you can't even be home to help get the kids off... Here... You take that, I'll take this. We're in such a rush now. Surely I could've taken care of her? How was I to know when you'd be home? You're out all the time. Hold onto the dog. Don't you think we have any contact? Not in these sorts of situations. I'll see you tonight, if it suits you to be home. Now I have to hurry. Barbel! Barbel! Wait! Barbel! I've won! I won! I won the competition! How nice! - Wonderful! - Coffee? - Thanks, but I have to call Barbel. - Some other time? - Love to. We'll do that. Look out, Nelson. Sorry, but if you were to buy something really good... I was winner at a festival... Sorry, I'm so worked up... I won a competition. What's something nice you can buy in Copenhagen? - Something for your wife? - Yes. Things like those rattlesnake eggs can be good. I won a festival... what do you say ... a competition. I'm a potter. I'm going across to buy something for my wife. I'm so happy. Sorry to bother you. You have to have someone to talk to sometimes. If you think I'm drunk, ma'am, it's just that I'm so happy today. I've won a competition for a wall decoration. I'm going across to Copenhagen to shop for my wife. I'm quite sober! That's nice for you. Sorry, I'm just so happy! If you can't hug your wife, you get to hug someone else. Are we picking up a hitchhiker? Your fellow passengers are complaining that you're bothering them. It's best you get off. No one's really complained, have they? I've made that judgment. Because I'm a bit happy? I shan't put up a fight... I'll go voluntarily. Thanks very much and have a happy journey. When you're standing in the workshop, wrestling with what you have in hand... ...something you may be showing the world... ...or to the immediate surroundings... ...you wonder where you stand. Are you anybody? Can you do anything? And then a moment like this arrives. and... and... Yes, then you wonder what to buy. No... that's not likely to be any sort of problem at all. Hopefully there'll be more? Yes, for sure. I just hope... ...that it's not the case forgiving everything, overlooking everything. But life feels a little easier, on occasions like this. Yes... I know what you're worth. Congratulations! Listen, about the money... Edna has the shits with me. As a matter of fact... Surely I can get my 200 back? I don't want to embarrass you. You show I'm good with money. I want to congratulate you on... Can't we be on first names? - I'm Per. - Ollie. I've got an insight into... Do you agree there are things that just can't be changed? Little things, that bug me. don't you think...? - Is it all fake, this? - No no. Teacher! Should WE be in tuxedos? Didn't I tell you? I didn't tell you? Damn it! You're in tux, teacher. I'm sorry, but it doesn't matter. "Close the trousers"? Where? Here? I'm sorry. The teacher must have forgotten to close his eyes last night, too. It's not just his fly. The teacher's red-faced and strange. - May I open the window? - No! I feel shitty today. I feel shitty, so I take the liberty. It's cold! Close the window again. I'll open another! May I take off my jacket? Ladies? No indecent remarks! If we don't have jackets, can we take off our shirts? - Ask the girls. - Teacher! Are you going to strip off, too, teacher? Paint some breasts there. That was why women got such big breasts. It wasn't motivated by... No, no, you're ruining the clothes. Be careful now. Having large breasts has nothing to do with milk production. She would always be receptive to sexual stimuli from the male. There is no mammal that is so sensitive to sexual stimuli... as the naked ape... as Desmond Morris called humans. We have earlobes, for example. No monkeys have them. They swell during intercourse and are extremely sensitive. And no monkeys have lips. They show the inside of their mouth as a signal... ...to the male. German researchers found that with mandrill males... ...that it has exactly the same markings on its nose as on its penis. It's like a signal to the female. It goes on all fours and hides its genitals, but shows its... What do you think about this? May I talk to you afterwards. Is this a drawing lesson? Painting lesson. Free expression under supervision. Yes... I can almost get the idea. - Here... I'll do it. - But there's not much left. Do you know that you look like my mother when she was little? I said you looked like my mother. I'll get this off. Desmond Morris... No, sorry, sorry, it was not my intention. - Now your lover comes and takes you! - I can joke with you, can't I? Why are you so angry about? Barbel... This is going to be executed... as I said to Harry, in stoneware with reinforcement. It will also include enamelled metal. This first part, I'll be calling... ...Black dance to the white man's tune. There'll be a little motto in Swahili... "Harambee bila mipaka." meaning cooperation without borders. Here, which I don't show... will be... some black brothers. And here I have a one-armed bandit - a poker machine... If you put in a coin, you can, with a little luck, get 50 back. Welfare in Sweden is shown here. Here is a bench you can sit on. It's at an easily accessible height... at bench height. People sit here. You can also put in a little money here. It's up to you. You can stick your feet in, or whatever. Then everything moves here, with all the supermarket food and... But no advertising, of course. Then you hear a belching from the whole thing. Then over here we have this, the core of the industry, so to speak. Gear wheels here... I can take that first. There I've only drawn a bookmark. I was going to have that as a friendly goblin, as you can see. Then you can press a small pedal, and then this opens. You see a toilet seat where Greed sits... I tried to get a mask in... but it hasn't worked out. Maybe that's not Greed... but it doesn't really matter. Here I'm going to have a peephole where you can see some pictures. Have any of you seen Lund's 'Erotica'? The erotic exhibition? It was made up of gatefold posters. It was a couple having intercourse, and you could unfold hem... and see exactly how they worked right in here. It was an excellent poster for sex education in schools, for example. So why not imagine a moneybox, to give developing country aid? We'll see. At child height, so that children can come in and watch as... ...how a natural function works. For example, one could show celebrities... The concept of celebrity... one could show them as they are. Christ has never been seen naked, for example. Would you mind turning the light off? Doesn't the artist believe that this could stand out on the street? In a work of art? Definitely! I want portray man as he is. The school's sex education is meant so that they should learn to reproduce! But this is purely for pleasure. Isn't that nice, though? This is going too far! Porno-propaganda! It's art, it's certainly not porn. My opinion is that the artist not only works with the company in his art... Now he runs the board by showing these pictures! May I speak? I want to protest. This is totally beyond the pale! We were there at your presentation where things were a bit formal... I thought maybe you could show the pictures at our office club. It would be interesting for the boys to see them. Well, they don't go through customs. - Are there girls in the club? - No, it's only for men. On Wednesday next week. Request fees if you have any costs. Yes, I... We take her and burn her up. Come on! Hurry up! To Mum... Charge! Tie her up! Quiet! Daddy's got a sore bum. Help to free her, Lina. - Free Dad! - Tie it up. Here's the string. Maria... Maria, bring it up here now. Take it up... No, forget it! - You can't take it off. - Don't! What are you doing? Yes, what are we doing? We're playing! We've got fish here. Fish! I don't like fish. What sort of fish? Nelson, come here! - Pike! - No, that's mackerel. It's delicious! Hello everyone. I caught these myself. - What giant fish! - Look. - Can I hold it? - I'm going to show the adults. - Are they slippery? - The Northern Army brings food. - Take it away! - Put it down. Have you caught them yourself? Yes. And I have a good recipe. You eat them raw, like the Japanese. How? Take it. I thought he only ate herring. What about the Indian chief? - Can I help you? - No, I can manage, thanks. - What do you do with it? - You cut it up like this. But we give them to Nelson, you and I can cook something else. That'd be a shame. Calm down! You cook instead. Take the fish and cook them. Per, you hurt me when you do that. Stop fooling around! Nice of you to come with fish. But it's the wrong day. I'll come another day instead. If the blows were another, tell me, tell me If the blows were another blow and met one on another day tell me, tell me Too small is the difference, although considerable between meeting and passing Gaming device. Invest in developing countries! You have a chance to get more than double back if you're lucky. Welcome to today's meeting. But there is a gentleman who's not on the board. This is on me, it's my initiative... It may have been untactful of me... but it's an interesting phenomenon in the artwork, that I want to include... namely the insecurity of a company. I don't think one should treat... Who is this person? You can... Gunnar Walter. - You're a lathe-operator, are you? - That's right. Mr. Walter... Maybe you can tell about your situation? One day I received a formal letter with an invitation to the boardroom... ...from the highest level, from Malmo, asking me to appear there. There were 10-12 others with me. I'd been employed for 18 years. There could only be one reason, I thought... That we were going to be laid off. "Released" I thought. "Can this be possible?" Excuse me, but this is not something to involve the board. But it doesn't involve the artwork. I want to incorporate it into the last tableau. We can't look at that now. The agenda has been fixed. It breaks up the subject matter of the board meeting. Yes, the agenda is fixed, but it doesn't include Gunnar Walter. Have you heard anything about this? We can't discuss this. But it involves my work of art. This is a service to the public. It's a comment on our society... and it's a serious problem. But it's not something that concerns this board! But if we go through my proposal, and examine it point by point... And this is one of ... In that case, it may be raised later. In the year 3000, or...? I propose that we... ...table the question. Mr. Walter to be notified by the Personnel Office... about what the future will hold. Yes, I'm sorry ... We can meet later. There is a lot of criticism against the company in the slot machine. The company's portrayed as a blood-sucker. And the benches are awful. What are they doing there? Mr Runesjo? If the porn preview is deleted and the benches remain... victims of structural rationalization are maybe discussing it over a snack. It's hardly the anniversary decoration that the company has in mind. I think the benches should be removed as well. Then we cut them out as a service to the public. The work shouldn't be only for the privileged? Isn't it in the company's interest that it be kept open to the public? Regardless... without exception. I can be made to make sacrifices. That's what's so difficult. I'll be home in good time. I'm just going to do a few more things here. - Have you talked to your wife now? - Mm. - Did she feel well? - Mm. - You feel okay? - Yes... so they say. - Can I remove this? - Mm. They say that? Don't you feel well? No. The human race is sick. Is it? You don't look sick. - No, but then... - You're freezing. What did I do? Crack a rib? Didn't you hear it break? Didn't you hear it crack? - Eh? - Nope. You're cute. - Am I? - Mm. - Cute, how? - Don't know... There are women of many descriptions in this queer world, as anyone knows Some are living in beautiful mansions and are wearing the finest of clothes There are blue-blooded queens and princesses who have charms made of diamonds and pearls but the only and thoroughbred lady is the Rebel Girl That's the Rebel Girl, that's the Rebel Girl! To the working class she's a precious pearl She brings courage, pride and joy to the fighting Rebel Boy We've had girls before, but we need some more in the Industrial Workers of the World For it's great to fight for freedom with a Rebel Girl Yes, her hands may be hardened from labor and her dress may not be very fine but her heart in her bosom is beating that is true to her class and her kind And the grafters in terror are trembling when her spite and defiance she'll hurl For the only and thoroughbred lady is the Rebel Girl Yes, that's the Rebel Girl, that's the Rebel Girl! To the working class she's a precious pearl She brings courage, pride and joy to the fighting Rebel Boy We've had girls before, but we need some more in the Industrial Workers of the World For it's great to fight for freedom with a Rebel Girl Are you the gardener here? This is Christina. You know each other. - Are you the one who let the dog out? - Yes, I opened ... This is the second time now. Yes, but he doesn't run away. - How about a cup of tea? - Yes. Shall I go and fix it? Then I have to go up to the house. Christina can, maybe. We can all go. We'll all go together. Shan't we? Together? Yes, alright. Something wrong? I was just wondering. I think it's pretty weird. I'd pick you up in the classroom. Then I see you and Christina hugging at the sink. We were washing each other. We thought... No... It's ridiculous. It was just... You tell her. That was just that we washed off each other. - And had fun doing it. - Yes... Why did you stay? I guess there must have been other students who had to be washed off. Sure. But as Per was our teacher... Wait! Isn't it the heat here that's making us a bit...? You distort everything... What are you getting at? I see you two together. It's perfectly natural to imagine... that something is going on. What do you both have to say? I think you've misunderstood it. It's no more than a teacher-student relationship. A funny sort of relationship. It's a very good sort. There's nothing special about it. I find it hard to believe you. Are you saying that I'm lying? No, but you're under- estimating me somewhat. Underestimating you? I have a feeling about it. But you two can sort it out. I can't be bothered with this. Look after the children. I've got other things to do. I'm totally fed up! Wait a moment! Is it me...? -Is it me you ladies are fighting over? Not at all. I just want the facts. - Facts? - I want to know how it is. If we'd had sex... or what? We were body-painting. Okay, turn it around... I stand with one of MY students, we may help each other... You stand there stark naked and painting. Naked to the waist, yes. How could anyone believe that constituted a relationship? But the way you were doing it! One can have a bit of fun! If I hold Christina like this... does that mean that I love her... and leave you and end our marriage? I think you two can sort this out. We can sort it out together, can't we? I'm fed up! It's not just this, but everything that's dumped on me. This might be the last straw! So, what's been dumped on you? What is it? You know what our relationship is like... How hard and tiring it is. I'm tired, and everything's hard. Can't we accept that's the way things are? We know that it's tiring, but we don't have to make everything worse. She visits you and I'm just a nuisance. Sure, we can have a cup of tea. So, let's drink tea together. Alright then! You two stay here. You're so stupid! Little lovely Anna, if you will hear me with your soul and heart until I am young and pure, but for love mature happy as the bird who hits his trill But the good old days they had to go... I got to learn to plough, and you sew. You go walking now And I'm behind the plough and seldom do we find the time No, I... I've got nothing... I don't expect anything from you ... ...more than what's there now. Why? I wish you'd experienced... ...that sensuality, that love, as a human being... ...the tenderness, which... if I can explain... Don't you think I experience it? Well, you might be engaged... You may be married! Aren't you? Are you in love, then? Yes. In Angelholm? No? So who? You're beautiful. We're not really on different sides. No, I don't believe that. That's why I don't want that you'll have to give in. I know you don't want that. Where were you last night? I was working. You have a dog here. I'll take care of him. I've sent Boman and Maria away. I'm going now. 'Bye. If the emotions were different, tell me, tell me. If the emotions went another way, tell me, tell me. If the emotions were different, and met one on another day tell me, tell me. The difference may be small, but it's huge, between hit and miss Mr Olofson, according to the board minutes... covering decisions on changes to your proposal... we look forward to hearing what you have to say regarding... the substitution of the slot machine... the flush toilet, the hole for porn, and the savings bankbook bench. Yes, Mr Chairman... ...members of the board... There is... at least I've heard talk about it... a motto that reads... To dispense with, is one way to completion. Take this. Can you manage? I'm going to take this! Take them to Bibbi. I'll take it! I'm strong. What do you think of to move home to me, then? Your name's not Bibbi! Yes it is. Is everything secure? At the same time, I think the company should make a community contribution. You could make a Majorca holiday... ...and show that company pay their workers enough... ...for them to holiday in Majorca. You could bring in something about the founder instead of the goblin mask. A picture of the founder. You could have a Christmas tree with glitter. Swedish people dancing around it, and a star on top with the founder's name. I insist you take my suggestions seriously. I mean that. I'm not saying what to do, just giving you a suggestion. The director had requested the floor. Mr Olofson... Does Mr Olofson appreciate that we're handling this matter in a democratic way. We aren't the hard-boiled reactionaries you seem to want to portray us as. No... I... We have a woman on the board. I thought one was elected for one's qualifications! So we've brought a woman onto the board. We discuss the matter in a democratic way. Everyone can have their say. And it means that together we'll arrive at a decision. We can't keep on discussing it. We're just going round in circles. We must make a decision. I suggest that the artist should receive his fee... but have someone else execute it, and the artist Olofson sign it. - Do we agree with that proposal? - Yes. Does Mr Olofson have anything to say? This has gone on quite long enough. Now the board demands an answer! Do you agree to receive a fee, that someone else completes the work... and you sign it? This is the board's proposal. I'm hungry, so I'll go and eat. Then I'll dismiss the suggestion. Does anyone have any other comments? Yes, it's an exceptional situation. I'll talk to our lawyer about how to tackle the problem. How are the kids? Is Maria there? No, it doesn't really matter. What? Alright. No, I was just thinking. No, say hi for me anyway. Yeah... 'bye. It's pretty angry. Also, it's far too long. Yeah, but... It's fucking incredible. I don't often get really pissed off... but when I do... Where will I...? Shall I go and scream in the town square? Or what? A newspaper is the right forum. Do you do anything for this company? - Is there advertising? - Not at all. But we have to act responsibly. I have responsibility as a human being. I wrote the article because I feel a responsibility! When the responsibility is absent from those who should feel responsible... - This is no longer your responsibility. - I can take responsibility. Impossible. Every newspaper has a responsible publisher. Write that Per Olofson has taken responsibility and you resign yours. Say I threatened you with death. Sorry, I can't help you. How about this...? Think it over, and cut it back a bit. A few changes. I'll help you. Fuck that! Sorry for swearing. I can't go on fucking begging. It's so damn pathetic of you! It's not just you I'm blaming! But someday ... You seem so timid. You... You have to realise that I've a responsibility to the paper! What about MY responsibility! I don't give a shit. Fuck it! If you knew how I feel! Don't I feel responsible for this life?! For the whole of society! I want to help you. You should avoid worrying about this. If I don't fix it, others will come after me! Maybe you'll give a damn about that! I don't believe in bloody revolutions, but sometimes one seems to be needed! Listen... can't we...? It sort of went that way. That you were a bit drunk? You've done it before, but haven't you...? You haven't... What did she say to you? She said... It was you who started petting, wasn't it? Did she say that? She sure did. Then I'll tell you how it really went. How did it happen, then? Don't you get it? It was her. So Barbel has... - Kissed me. - Damn you... He's nuts. - I'm sick of this... - Shut up then. - Is this my wife or yours. - My wife. Fuck it, I just mean... It's their business! Aage, for fuck's sake! Tell me now. Speak, Aage. - Damn it all...! - What? Is it a thing between you and him, or...? It's my wife, for fuck sake! Let's go... It's nothing to... Can no bastard call her? Talk to her, eh? How do you want it? Go to blazes! It's THEIR problem. - Open the door! - It's theirs. It's our business as well as theirs. Don't get involved in it. Alright, alright... Hi, it's me. I'm at the harbour with the guys. Aage's here. Quiet! Please tell him what you told me about what happened. I want you to do it. So was it definitely you? Yes or no? So that's your final word? Of course it was me. Damned women! Fuck it, I had a bird who dumped me for my own brother. My brother! Are we sorts of brothers? Yes, I think so. We are. I really want to slap you. I'd like to slap you. A slapping duel. I don't begrudge you having good time. But there's nothing that can destroy... this... ...the thing between us. Birds... You haven't had that many. Birds are like that sometimes. Have you been with many? No, but that sort... Sometimes. Once. She was it, you mean. Where's Barbel now? - Where is she? What's she thinking? - She doesn't know where we are. She's away with the girl. And we sit in the old hotdog stall. Barbel is there. Neither of us are there. - I'm not mad at you. - But this kind of thing sticks. There are things which can't be destroyed. Obviously you should be able to put this sort of thing behind you... ...without needing to drop dead. So we'll do that. Any beer left? This is my last one. Cheers. - What do you have? - "Sour herring". No! Calle, what do you want? We're tossing Aage out. May I talk to you, Per and Aage. Come in, Barbel. - Take a beer. - No, I want to talk to you. Come here now! Please, can you go out or something. -What the hell do you have to say to me?! -I have a lot to say to you. I've quite a lot to say to you. You forced me to say something that wasn't true. Aage... You made the first move. I think you can admit that. Did you have nothing to do with it? No... You've forced something from me... I've had to give in. Well say it... Was it you? Yes. Sure? I don't know why I did it! Sure? I said I don't know why! Fuck it! Yes...? Nothing really happened. Nothing happened. So you say. You heard what she said. She's... She's a decent woman. Yes, but tell me... - She's a decent woman. - I like you too much to... ...... I'm going to be pissed off, whoever acted most improperly. I think this has affected me a lot. Is that so? I now know that I have a damned nice wife. Is that so? So nice, that others want to bed her. Feel the same way. Fucking hell! What a nice wife I have! - It's true. - I really do! Barbel! Goddamn boondocks... That's my car! - Leave the car alone! - You're crazy! What the fuck are you doing? Ready... One... two... three! As a highlight of our anniversary celebration, the company has decided to present a work of art created by the artist Per Olofson. That he was previously employed in the company gives us special joy. Unfortunately, the artist was unable to be present today. I hope the artwork will please both employees and the general public. Well... here's the artist. Welcome. This work of art that you see here... ...and that I have signed... Once you have signed a thing, you're obliged to stand up for it. However, this work of art... ...does not contain all the ideas that I had planned for it. I had wanted a slot machine... A one-armed bandit to take money to help the third world but you can get 50 back, and if you do... put it back. We take hundreds, millions, billions from the so-called third world! And then I wanted that these people should be writhing in pain. Of a lucky circumstance it says "limited operation". Here... the company's founder. Honour him. But there is also... ...a danger when a lot of money is finishes up in a few hands. There is an arbitrariness which can easily occur. We have here... ...a depiction of a holiday. Of course I have depicted rest. But at the same time, there lies something fraudulent... ...in depicting something like this... That everything is as it should be. It's not as it should be. And I think at some point... ...during the year, a few times during your life... you also agree with me. I'm just appealing... It's you who'll do something about it. We can not constantly leave it to others. Thanks for listening. Hey! Do you want to come along? If knowledge were different, tell me, tell me If knowledge went another way, tell me, tell me.
