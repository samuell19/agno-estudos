Now thatl am here Sister" Need not There are others who need the medicine If you didn't understand, then just ask him.. Doctor, did you fall for his performance? It isn't difficult to establish who Nitya is.. And that is his motive too.. Five years.. It took me five years In five years.. I erased Nitya's memories.. Now whoever tries it will not come back This confidence is good But he is smart Unlike the doctors who came before him There is something different in his eyes If his report goes negative Not just Nitya Everything will go off our hands For someone who came from somewhere What is his business here?

My elder brother's only daughter Oh s.. Thampuran (Noble) Yes, we have met once.. He had come to discuss his daughter's condition He was very upset" I told him that skills like martial arts will be of great help to these kids Autism is not a disability It is a.. Different ability Don't underestimate them.. My brother has left us.. There is no one in the house.. If anything happens to him, To leave Nitya here ls what my brother had told me before his death My brother's notings about Nitya is in this These are the documents of the property assigned in Nitya's name Including this Bungalow in the High Range. You can use it for Nitya's treatment To trust and handover her in this condition, I do not know anyone else, other than you Doctor, you must bring her up like your daughter. Nitya.. Nitya.. It is on my asking that you have been brought here The thing you gave me when you had left I have kept it safe.. Now when will you give, what I had asked I have felt that it is him who has understood my daughter more than I have The deficiencies others found in them were their similarities Nadakkal Nobles lorded over the land called Edanad.. As a continuation of that lineage came Elder brother Balarama Verma, younger brother Sekharan, Younger sister Lakshmi and me Elder brother who's being disabled by birth... ...and Sekharan who was not blessed with kids, The opposition to me for being the custodian was natural But my daughter who lost her mother at birth Was stamped mentally retarded And was demanded to be abandoned By elder brother and Sekharan Opposing them, I brought her up Standing by me, were younger sister Lakshmi And her only son Vinayan, that's all.. The time I spent for Nitya turned into years As time passed with the realization of my efforts going in vain I discovered it Gathering back the confidence that was ebbing I wore the martial dress for my daughter The changes in her surprised everyone..
