Thank you. Scan his right hand. Transfer complete. We've got a problem. Pull out. Mama Mia! Twenty seconds from now! Now! Ten seconds! --Hey! --Excuse me? You can't sleep here, Sir. I'm sorry. There's a restroom upstairs. It's okay. Let's talk about an intelligence war in our history. Do you know the story of King Mu and Princess Sunhwa? Yes! King Mu heard of how beautiful the enemy country's princess was. He fell in love. Oh, hello! I'm here on business. In public exhibitions? It's not that. Do you have time for coffee? I'm busy. Wait. Cut me some slack. I'm no pervert or anything. I told you before. I'm not interested in dating. If you'll excuse me. "Message from Sohn Hyuk" It's been a long time. Sorry I'm late. Sit down. Your face looks gaunt. ls something wrong? No, it's nothing. So, how are you settling in here? Fine. I'm getting used to things. That's good. The work's not too hard? No. As the DIS branch chief here, I'll be staying in Seoul. [DIS: American Intelligence] We'll be meeting often. Wait. Happy birthday. Hope you like it. As of today... ...DIS East-Asia will collect info on Korea's new nuclear reactor. All Korean intelligence, as well as China, Japan, North Korea, and Russia... I want everything you can find on the new reactor. Someone's here from the Japan branch. How may I help you? As you know, we collect info and do research. I have something to report to you directly, Sir. Just report it to the appropriate agent. But I must tell you directly! That's not reporting procedure. Ever heard of an organization called Athena? What did you just say? Athena. Athena? I have prepared a report for you. Athena is a secret organization that rules the world's energy market. Its existence is completely veiled. From regime changes in Central America to civil wars in Africa... ...and the war in Iraq. Athena is linked to all of them. To keep their rule, they'll kill, start terrorist attacks... and even start wars. Korea is secretly developing a new nuclear reactor. SQ? The new reactor could threaten Athena's hold on the energy market. Athena will issue a terrorist attack to stop the reactor development. Belle Ayachi. A member of the terrorist Islamic extremist group GIA. The U.N. bombing in Algiers, car bombings in Bouira... He's directly and indirectly related to various cases. Where's Ayachi now? He entered the country under the name Nadan. He came up on our filtering system. Find out why he's here. Arrest him if you have to. Ayachi's dead? Why? Korean intelligence was tracking him. If he was caught, our plans would have failed. He had to be disposed of. Yes, Sir. From Ayachi's things at the hotel, we found his contact. Name: Seo Min-hyuk. A former North Korean intelligence agent sent out to spy on Third World countries' military actions. But he deserted the North and became a terrorist. NIS had Seo on the black list and kept track of him. But he disappeared without a trace a few years back. Then let's send out our agent. Dang... You're the expert who'll help me? Man... Just my damn luck. Who owns this house? No need to know. Just be thankful. --You know I'm-- --Population of 110,000... A small city. What could they want from here? These places... Nothing much in common. I can't make it out. Go buy something to drink. Me? Come on! I'm older than you. Stop bossing me around. Damn kid's got no respect. By chance, are you Korean? I heard... that NTS is working on something overseas. SQ? They're tracking a North Korean terrorist. They're in Vicenza, Italy. Vicenza? What is it, Sir? Some Korean agents are in Vicenza. They're onto our target. What did you do for them to catch on? I'll take care of it, Sir. What's going on? What happened? Are you okay? Give it to me! --What? --The phone. The phone? What the hell is going on? --Yes, Sir. --Seo's target is a VIP. Go quick! What's going on? Jung-woo! Just a student? You're the Korean President's only daughter. My father's the President, but I'm just a student. I don't know what you people want. But you won't get it like this. Well... We'll see about that. [AISI, CISR: Intelligence Agencies of Italy] Let's begin. Are you okay? Yeah. They're here from headquarters. I heard you got injured. Are you okay? Yes, Sir. Scope the scene of the abduction. You lead her. Yes, Sir! Who is she, Sir? No need to know. Just do your jobs. See you later. Do you know her? She is... ...an exhibition guide at NIS. A guide? Wait. Black, right? I've heard of special task force agents in NIS. Are you a Black agent? I'm sorry. I can't say anything right now. There's a call from the abductors. Can you trace the IP? It's an Internet phone with IP Spoofers. The IP is changing every second, Sir. I'll keep working on it. Yes, Chief? Get started. I'm in charge. Speak. You sound too young. Is that a problem? No, it doesn't matter. I'll tell you our demands. No. Hear my condition first. We will not listen to your demands until we know the VIP is safe. Why should I listen to your terms? I already know who you are. So, me seeing you won't be a problem. You decide the time and place to meet. Su-young? Are you okay? Who are you? Take her away. Wait. Satisfied? What is your demand? They said they'll hand her over an hour after getting Dr. Kim. No simultaneous exchange. We don't have a choice, Sir. Okay. "Cheongwadae" They demand we hand Dr. Kim over to their men in China. Who's Dr. Kim Myung-guk? As the head of North Korea's nuclear research center, he is the central figure in nuclear power. Why do they want him from us? Because he's with us now. He secretly came to us three years ago. NTS has him under witness protection. He's the key figure to our new nuclear reactor. We cannot accept their demand. But Su-young's life is on the line, Sir. The new nuclear reactor is our country's future. We can't give it up like this. Have you made a decision? You know very well who can solve this diplomatic problem. I understand. Thank you. Call the American embassy. Set up all the equipment in that room. --Yes, Sir. --Who are you people? I'm the chief of DIS East-Asia. We're running things here as of now. Give us all the info you have on the case. Who did the negotiating? A word with you, please. What happened? The Korean government asked for help under the condition that they disclose info on Dr. Kim. Washington accepted the proposal. They sent DIS to rescue her. You plan on rescuing her? I have no interest in that. I just need Dr. Kim Myung-guk. Did you meet Seo Min-hyuk? Yes. Did you reveal yourself? No. Just in case. Good call. He'll be disposed of after this is over anyway. I don't understand, Sir. Just do as they say. Why should America step in when we can handle it ourselves? Cooperate as you're asked. Lee Jung-woo... Remember, our goal is to rescue the VIP. It's where I went to meet them. There's a date and time imprinted on it. Using my shadow and height, we can find out the latitude and longitude. Find the place quickly. Get ready to head out immediately. We'll be meeting soon, Dr. Kim. It's an isolated village surrounded by mountains. We don't know their exact location. The entire village is our zone of operation. Here. It's hard to get to and easy to defend. 87% probability, Sir. What is it? I have something to report, Sir. The Korean government has no intention of handing Dr. Kim over. What are you talking about? I saw him leaving for China. I don't know where or how, but Dr. Kim's vanished. It's a trick. This operation will be a Silent Storm. That cuts down mission time and is good to subdue the enemy. But it jeopardizes the hostage's safety. Of course it'd be best if we can save the hostage, too. But we have no choice here. For us... We must take 'em out no matter what. It's where our VIP is held hostage. Listen up. DIS is issuing a Silent Storm. It's a tactic that has no regard for the hostage's safety. Save our VIP no matter what. Move out, now. Do I have to go, too? No one ever listens to me. It's an ambush! How much time left? Twenty minutes, Sir. Call China and check. --Yes, Sir. --Where's Dr. Kim? He's not here yet. Letl$ go! Untie her! We're getting out of here. Escape route at 11 o'clock! Start searching! Get her! It's so good to see you again. Hold on. Now, run! Drop your guns! Come any closer and this bitch is dead! Drop your gun! Drop it! It's a trap! Please understand our agents' rash actions. Due to this case... ...Washington's quite concerned. The Korean government hiding many things... It won't be good for the two countries' relationship. Till next time, then. May I have a word with you? I just... ...want any sort of explanation. What happened? Do you get it now? Why I avoided meeting you personally? --But... --There's nothing to explain. I'll be going, then. Sorry, I'll meet you at the airport. Is Yoon Hye-in your real name? Call me whatever. I'll respond. Just tell me one thing. Did you eat? Can I see you again at the exhibition hall in Korea? Well... I'm not quite sure. If we're destined to meet again, we will. What is it? It's nothing much. Just a small gift. Like you say, having feelings for someone in our line of work... ...is quite foolish and dangerous. But I can't let you go. I can't get on to the Intranet here. Something wrong with my ID card? Can't be. Which storage is it? We've recently readjusted security. It won't work now. Tell me what you need. I'll get it for you. It's me. Okay. Good work. Finally... We've found Dr. Kim's location. Let's go! We've got a problem, Chief! --What is it? --Dr. Kim's been abducted. What? How? This way. Even the SNC is gone? [SNC: Central Device to Korea's New Nuclear Reactor] I'm very sorry, Sir. How could this happen? There must be a problem in NTS security. I'm deeply ashamed. If Dr. Kim's abductors got their hands on the SNC... ...that means they have all our nuclear reactor technology. There's not much time till we announce the new reactor. If it leaks, all our efforts will go to waste. We'll get Dr. Kim and the SNC back before then, Sir. When we do, I'll take responsibility and resign. What is it... ...that you want from me? You know very well what this is. Well, then... From now on... ...you'll work on the SNC here. Please don't say you can't or you won't. You don't want your blood on my hands. Do you? As you all know, the new nuclear reactor doesn't need replacement for a century with this innovative technology. The SNC is the central part to making that possible. Dr. Lee was murdered while transporting the SNC. There are no leads as to who killed him and took the SNC. Let's start with this. All NTS agents will focus on the SNC case. Send a response team to Japan. Get the CCTV files from around Dr. Kim's safety house first. And search all nearby ports and airports. I'll request investigations for cooperation. Tell Japan that it's a case on industrial spies. As of 7 p.m. last night, Yonago Airport security has been elevated. We'll do our best till it's cleared. Thank you. Things must be crazy on that team. Is it okay to come out? It's fine. Dr. Kim started working on it. It'll take a week or so to finish up. Isn't it better to get out of Japan? --Wouldn't that be safer? --No. All routes are blocked. It won't be easy to get out. It's better to finish things up... ...then get rid of Dr. Kim. Until the SNC is completed, keep letting us know the NTS team's movements. The hell? What the hell are you doing? Well... It must be an overload during testing. It happens all the time. The power's back on, Sir. What strange signal? The voltage and current shot up way beyond the norm. Up to SNC testing levels. I'll check it out. Send me the location. Yes, Sir. How's the situation there? We got it wrong. It's Kurayoshi, not Tottori. Okay. I'll make the report. We got a call! Let's go! Our location's been exposed. We gotta go, Sir. We're pulling out now. Put the SNC in the truck and get Dr. Kim. Yes, Sir! Cease fire! Don't you know what's inside there? Take Dr. Kim and go! Drop the gun. Get up. Get down! Jun-ho! Get in! They're waiting in the meeting room, Sir. We requested autopsies on the bodies at the scenes. And started analysis of their belongings. It's getting harder to predict what they'll do next. That means Dr. Kim doesn't have much time left. Yes? What did Chief Kwon of NTS say? Luckily, they found the SNC. But these incidents mean there are problems in NTS security. Keep a close watch. Yes, Sir. "We need to talk. Meet me at the boat club. Hye4n" So, why'd you suddenly want to meet up? What? I came 'cause you texted me. Said you wanted to talk. Stop kidding. Jung-woo. Jung-woo... "Tottori, Japan" Hye-in... Hye-in... Hye-in! The hell you doing?! I'll cut to the chase. We want the SNC back. Who are you? Fool... Let her go! What do you think you're doing?! Okay! Okay! Let the woman go! I'll bring you the SNC. Let the woman go. Now, we're talking. Remember, we have ears inside the NTS. The minute you talk, the woman dies. I'll meet you there in 15 minutes. Gotcha. Even if we can't rescue Hye-in, we must not lose the SNC. Cover me good. Just do your damn job. They're here! 12 o'clock! Secure position. There's more at 6 o'clock. Hold on. Hand over the bag. Stop. Let the woman go. Sure thing. No! Hye-in... Okay. We got the SNC back. Wrap up and get ready to go. That way. What happened to Jung-woo? He's probably dead. See you next time. It's gas. Hye-in! No, the place will explode! --Jung-WQQ! --Jung-WQQ! Hye-in! Hye-in! Hye-in... Hye-in! It's a bomb! Let's go! --We gotta get out! --Jung-woo! Hye-in! There's no time! We gotta get out! Hye-in! Hye-in! I-lye-in! Hye-in! Hye-in! Hye-in! Jung-woo! Are you okay? Stay with Hye-in. Jung-woo! Hye-in... Hurry! Where's Dr. Kim? He's dead, Sir. Let's pull out. Let's go. I won't ask why you did that. Get rid of Jung-woo. Hye-in! Hye-in! I-lye-in! Like you say, having feelings for someone in our line of work... ...is quite foolish and dangerous. But I can't let you go. What the hell are you doing? What are you up to? I came to check on something. What? Washington DIS has suspicions about you. Continue. I reported your strange actions to Washington headquarters.
