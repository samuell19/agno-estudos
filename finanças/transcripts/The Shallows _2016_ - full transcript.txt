Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick Oh-oh! Is that you on the beach? - Oh, no, no, that's my, that's my mom. - Oh. Yeah. She came to this beach when she found out she was pregnant with me. I've never been, but, uh, it's kind of our beach. That's my little sister. Ah. Um, you want to see more photos? - I can... - Um... It's only for your eyes. Real. Authentic. You're right. Thank you. Sorry. I'm American. Not too many gringos here. - Yeah, bummer. - Gracias a Dios. She's not coming? Uh, my-my friend. You know, uh, mi amiga. You know, the girl we left back at the hotel? You know, she smelled like Don Julio... and bad choices? She always does this to me, too. She-she just, she just disappears. She's like the-the-the fantasmo, no? You know, you know fantasmo? - Fantasma, con "A." - Sí, con "A." The whole reason I planned to come on this trip, con "A," was-was-was to find the secret beach. And now she's just stuck back at Las Rocas with the Irish flu. Nursing a hangover. Sí. Major hangover. You-you don't like it when someone change your plans, do you? No, I don't. No, I don't, it's just, you know. It's not fair. Ooh, you know why, though? It's because I'm reliable. - You know "reliable"? - Uh... "Reliable." Bossy. Um, I am re-li-able. Yes, bossy. - That's me. - Very bossy. Hey, um... what is this beach called? You're not gonna tell me. Cool. Cool. Frio. Not possible. It's too hot here. No, no, you're cool. You're being cool. Oh, never mind, that's good. All right, I got it. Is this the one? Sí. This is paradise. Yeah. It's perfect. Uh... This is the island of the pregnant woman. No? La isla? No. Yes. The nose... the breasts... and her stomach. No. Yes, it is for me. Gracias. Gracias, señor, um... - No, no, no. Por favor. - No, please. Please. Please, I insist. No, no, we were going the same way. I live close by, so... don't worry. Oh, are you sure? - Yes. - Okay. Well, thank you. You're welcome. I'm Nancy. - Carlos. Charlie. - Nice to meet you, Charlie. Nice to meet you. Um, you know, have, high school. You're in school? No. I mean, I was in medical school, but we didn't have Spanish there, just cadavers. I'll shut up now. Okay, uh, dark in a few hours, so... Oh, I never surf at night. And, uh, how you getting out from here? Uber. Who is Uber? Never mind. Thank you, Carlos. Thank you again for taking me here. It means a lot to me. - Okay. - Uh, what did you say the name of it was again, though? I just forgot, for some reason. Careful. Always. Hey! You speaking Spanish, guera? I-I don't understand. I'm sorry. He say that it is hard to paddle against the current. Yeah, I wasn't expecting that. I almost got caught on the inside coming out. - You American? - Okay. Sí. Sí, American. Yeah! California? Uh, close. Texas. There's surf in Texas? Yes, we have surf in Texas. It's just not like this, though. Hey, this is a secret break. How you find it? Someone told me about it a while ago. What's it called? If I tell you, I would have to kill you! Well, that would ruin my day. Anything gnarly out here, I should know about? There's some rocks over there! There's only one tide a day, and when the tide gets low, it becomes an island. There's some nasty fire coral. It stings like a jellyfish. Okay! Gracias. Sí... Hey, guera... Still have no idea what you're saying. He's saying that you should come over here. The wave breaks better. Oh, I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm cool here, thank you. Careful, gringa. It's rough out here for a little girl from Texas.

You're okay. I'm helping you, little buddy. Let me see you. I'm not very good at ortho, but... it just looks like a dislocation. Like a separated shoulder. I think it's the same. We'll see, huh? I'm just gonna do this quick, okay? It's gonna hurt just for a second, and then you're gonna be okay. On three. Ready? One... two... three. I think we did it. Ah! Ah! Hey, hey, hey! That's a terrible way to say thank you. Now you've got a chance, huh? And here comes the tide. Camera. That's the third time. I got you. 32 seconds from the whale to the rock. Ah, ha, ha! Fuck! iAyuda! iAyuda! Come on, I got you! I got you! I got you! I got you! Come on! Hold on! Oh. Someone got you. 30, 40 yards. One-minute swim. I can make that. I need a head start. This is Nancy Adams. It's April 26, 2016. Uh, if you find this, please send help right away. I've been attacked by a shark. He's killed three other people since I got here. He's still circling, so... Uh, he's got this big old whale over here, but that-that's the problem. I swam right up onto his feeding ground. I've been bitten pretty deeply into my-my gastroc and quad muscles. I have a-a deep gash running vertically down my medial thigh, and then it turns lateral, just above my knee. And right here, there 's one going across my, my posterior calf. I'm losing a lot of blood. Gangrene is setting in. I feel like I'm losing my strength. I don't think I have much time. The-the island I'm on is-is gonna be taken by the tide in a few minutes. I'm about 200 yards off the shore. On this beach. I never found out what it was called. So... Um... This is useless. There 's a buoy... which I'm gonna try to swim to... about 30 or 40 yards away. So, yeah. That's... that's the plan. Um... If you find this, can you just, um... can you just delete that first part, and, uh, and send it to, uh, 10231 Oliver Crescent Drive, Galveston, Texas. That's my home. That's-That's where my, uh, that's where my dad and sister live. Yeah. Hey, Pop. Hey, Chlo. Um... I finally got that alone time. Super overrated. Uh... I mean I'm not, I'm not totally alone. I got this little dude. Steven Seagull here, keeping me company. Show 'em your wing. I fixed him for you, Chlo. I just don't want you guys to worry, and I don't want you to feel, um, you know, bad or anything, 'cause... I love you so much, and I miss you more than I ever... I ever even realized I could. Dad, I gotta get off this rock soon, um... but I want you to know I'm gonna fight. I am. Just like she taught us. You were right. I love you. I love you so much. Time to go. It's okay. It's okay. You got it. Good job. You're gonna make it, buddy. You're okay. Okay. Okay. Shit. Oh, you're kidding me. You didn't like that, 'cause it stings like jellyfish. This is my head start. Come on... Come on! Okay... No, no, no, come back. Come back. Oh... come back. Come back. Come on. Come back. This is Nancy Adams. It's April 26, 2016. Uh, if you find this, please send help right away. I've been attacked by a shark. He's killed three other people since I got here. I'm losing a lot of blood. I feel like I'm losing my strength. I love you more, short crop. I'll be home soon. No way. Mom's beach, right? Not everyone can be helped. I don't want you to feel, you know, bad or anything. I gotta go, Dad. I'll see you later. Hey, sweet pea. ...she was a fighter. I could shoot tubes... I'm gonna fight, just like she taught us. Uh-uh. Where are you? Fuck you. Oh, shit. No... no! No! No! iMiguel! iPapá! iPapá! iÓrale! iÁndale! iÁndale! Relax. Relax. Breathe. Breathe! I'm okay. Ready to get wet, Dr. Adams? Well, we'll see about that. Nancy... Ma would be proud of you. Both of you. Thanks, Papa.
