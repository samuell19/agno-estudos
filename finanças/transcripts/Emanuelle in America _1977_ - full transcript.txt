- Bye, girls! - Bye! - Have you lost weight? - Yes, a little She's seeing this guy Tony, he's studying philosophy So philosophers like thin women, or just want them to suffer? No he's great, we talk about all sorts of things... but talking is all we do Don't worry, He's probably just a bit shy You've got what it takes t0 cure him of that Good luck - See you later, girls - Bye OK, put that gun down. This is all the money I have I don't want your money. Turn off here and stop No I get it. You want the car - No... - It's OK you can have it, - I'll just take a taxi - N0 What I want is to kill you What...? - What did y0u...? - You heard me Pull up over here Why do you want to kill me'? Just look around... The people in the streets... Can't you see what's going on? We're all headed for disaster and nobody sees it N0 values, no ideals, no respect for morality If I kill you I'll give the world a lesson in morality - But I don't understand, why me? - You don't understand? Here, take a look She's called Janet She's an angel But she's corrupted and it's your fault. You're evil You stimulate the base instincts in people Sex... Sex is sin and damnation Let's just talk about this I'm sure I can understand it Stay calm and explain it to me An executioner should get to know his victim How would you explain this to a jury? I'm not scared of any trial, I'm innocent I'll explain I destroyed the symbol of sin and they'll thank me But I will give you a few minutes t0 repent your sins Thanks, that's nice of you - You're Tony, right? - How do you know that? Janet's talked a lot about you She loves you very much Don't talk about Janet! She was pure and now you've corrupted her with sex But now I'm going t0 redeem her by killing you Why do you look at me like that? You think I'm crazy, right? I don't think that, not at all I was thinking how nice you are and Janet's a good girl There's nothing wrong with being photographed It's just a job like any other N0, you are a corrupter, you don't film flowers or children It's always sex, nothing but sex! And sex is the cause of all the evils of this century Have you ever made love? Never! I am pure But when I was a child I saw my mother naked once It was shameful, I'll never forget it You are right Sex can be shameful Corruption, prostitution, but not always When it happens naturally, innocenfly, then it's a vital force of nature bringing joy and happiness... andloven. Even if only for a moment... What... what are you doing? What... N0... please... Stop... Please... Oh God... Stop it... It's loaded I don't care Give it to the police D0 whatever you want It was really scary With such a crazy guy anything could have happened You going to report it'? Why? That mightjust hurt Janet Anyway, it might have just made me stronger Above all, I survived it, didn't I? Then we should celebrate your escape from danger. I'd love to but I have a meeting in 15 minutes They won't mind, they know you already We do know each other but work isn't like that Bill, we've been having this conversation for 5 years now And whenever I spend 5 minutes with you... I always get the same urge It's the same for me, but right now I'm in a hurry S0 you're going to leave me in this state? You've solved it by yourself many times You'll make me do something crazy, like marrying you! There What difference would that make? It would be a crime, not crazy A crime against freedom Which is essential for both of us So, do I have t0 use this gun t0 prove I love you? That would prove the opposite What good is a dead lover? Hi? Can you tell Joe that Emanuelle will be 5 minutes late? Thank you, my love... You're the best girl in the world N0 need to thank me, it's no great sacrifice That's it Now the left... The left, that's it Again... that's it One, two.. One, two... go on! Again, on the body On the body... Quick, with the left On the left Hi, Joe Hi Emanuelle Well? Come on, you're distracting the boys, it could be dangerous - But I only just got here - And 0ne's down already - I tried Charlie, but no dice - Who's Charlie? The guy who replaced me You know, at a certain age even bodyguards get retired, even though I can still do it - He's an idiot - Who? Van Deeren, he has millions but knows nothing Put me out to grass but who else has fists like these? 87 knock outs in 88 fights But the 88th got you He was a bastard - Right - You know it He'd hidden an iron bolt in his glove First shot, I start t0 attack, I go for the big one and straight off he's in trouble You told me before, Joe, all fifteen hits Let's get down t0 business You promised me info about Van Deeren In fact I brought a check as an advance, but... You didn't have t0 do that, but since you did... Don't let me down now, Joe, impossible doesn't exist for you Yeah, but it's not easy, I told you. They need another virgin Then I'm screwed Not like that Virgo, August 24th to September 23rd But I was born in December I'm Joe, no problem changing the date on your passport When's your birthday? I was born in September, I'm a Virgo Like old Joe told you - Don't you trust him? - Totally You're Charlie, right? The boss likes the girls to dress in what he chooses for them Leaving nothing t0 the imagination, eh? Don't you think a hot bath is as nice as a lovers caress? Old Joe never told me that you were such an iceberg Erik van Deeren... S0 now I'm part of the furniture All the girls are identified by their zodiac sign Wear it at all times Don't you like virgins? Didn't old Joe tell you about the rules here? - But even I have my limits - What are they? You just passed them Hey, Paul, where are the girls? Miss! Miss... The girls aren't allowed here, come with me S0 what are the girls allowed? The boss doesn't like questions When am I going to meet this boss? You don't get it, you're at his disposal He's boring, your boss Fancy a swim? The boss doesn't allow that sort of thing Really? I must remember that It's the new Virgo. Where are you from? New York The last Virgo was Italian - Where is she? - The boss got tired of her She put on too much weight She was paid off and sent home Hi, I'm Gemini Virgos and Gemini are supposed to get 0n Where can I get a costume? Over there Poor thing, she can't resist Since she met that Pedro, she just lost her head She totally crazy And she knows the boss likes it, right? Come on in, Emanuelle, the water's lovely! Come on, this could be fun - D0 you think she's up for it? - Yes Hi You must be Mr Van Deeren, the boss Welcome Yes. Nice choice Good old Joe I'll get to know you later Always fit, eh? That's how I like it So, my dear Duke... You're the first guest who's not taken advantage of our generosity And yet you're so refined What is it that's not to your taste? I find it all a bit banal I'm used to different customs More traditional ones You prefer the chase, then? That takes too much energy, which I save for the important things - Such as power? - Why not? You should fight for power, but not for love It's a question of market values, that's all And emotions? There are many ways t0 express your emotions... hate, love... I want different things from women With these ones you can have whatever you want All different, depending on your mood With them you can experience all varieties of eroticism and love You are about to see a form of sex that really interests rne A speciality of one of my girls It might interest you It's a question of availability being ready for anything But what do they think about it? Who cares what they think? They are happy to give themselves in exchange for the money they get To see the world in top hotels drink champagne and eat caviar, their only task to satisfy the whims of a man, and themselves too, of course Look What's up? I haven't worn the medallion for 2 months For 2 months he's not touched me Always the others He enjoys making me excited, then rejects me Isn't there anyone else you can do it with? N0, it's forbidden One time I argued with him and this is my punishment - I can't stand it any longer - So why don't you leave? And go where? Back to Spain to work in my father's restaurant? Can you imagine it? A suburb of Madrid, serving truck drivers and drunks, hands all over you, can you imagine? Depends on the truck driver, some can be great Don't make fun of me, please I wasn't, forgive me You don't have t0 go back to Spain You could get a job, do whatever you want I want to stay here Van Deeren has his ways, but it's a good life here What can I do? What can I do if he no longer wants me? - If he ignores me like this! - Stop it! This man is destroying you. He's conditioned your mind - You think you're different? - I certainly do I like to choose my men, and never for money You'll change here, you'll get to like it I don't want t0 leave - I want... - What do you want? I don't know. I feel so alone lneedlove I need it so much When you gave rne the medallion, I thought l'd faint with happiness The power of your mind... your wealth, your vision, they dominate the world Your wonderful body t0 be worshipped You can have anything you want of me S0 long as your hands touch rne, caress rne Wait! Don't you want to whip me first? To make me suffer? To show me your power, your strength What else can I do? But who'd believe it? That you're just another man, like any other, despite your money Poor Erik Van Deeren What a sad story A man who's never known real love in his life Who's had to buy it all: respect, orgasm, desire Shut up you fool You are scared of women Women who can speak terrify you They could destroy you Poor Erik Van Deeren You can do anything now Only you can't let yourself go, without help This is a dangerous game... but I like the novelty I didn't know Virgos were like that Suppose it isn't a game... I'm your boss and you know it Take care, don't provoke rne I shall enjoy taming you It's going t0 be a pleasure, a different sort of pleasure - Are you sure you'll succeed? - I succeed with everything I do I know, that's why I'm here May I PlaY? - Are you serious? - Why not? What if you lose? How will you pay? I'll work for you the rest of my life Full house Pair of kings Straight Two aces Four aces Impossible - Three throws in a row - Want to quit? N0, for God's sake. I never lose, never! - Luck like that makes me sick - She's just a very good player N0, I'm just having a bad night I'll win it all back, to the very last cent I'm sorry I have to leave, I'll miss your revenge Winning makes me tired, I'm really sleepy - Can I go to bed? - Yes, go... G0 to hell! Can you let me off at the next bus st0p?? But... what on earth are you doing there? - Like to sit up front? - Sure - Where are we going? - To Venice Ok, let's go I knew you were different H0w'd you know that? Just a feeling And watching you play last night - I love winning against millionaires - What will you do with the money? I bought my freedom with it I wondered how you'd got away The first thing I do in a place I don't know... is to make friends with someone - In what way? - My own way A silly question, but what was a girl like you doing there? Or you, for example? - Trying to screw him - Me too May I be your next victim? I should introduce myself... Duke Elvize 0f Mount Elba I'm Emanuelle - Are you a real Duke? - Yes Our line goes back 400 years, one of the oldest Venetian families I thought all those left were preserved in gilded castles I'd be interested t0 know more - I'm willing - N0 I must go to New York Come to the big party we're having in our gilded castle Those photos are amazing Van Deeren's private harem This is the sort of thing that sells newspapers S0 my political piece can't be used? That's not going to attract the same audience as these We don't want to cause you two any prob/ems... Of course not, I love what she's doing I can't wait to see her again Well, I think you're going to have to Wait a while longer Why? Where is she now? This way - Did you have a good trip? - Yes, very good thank you Please, call me Laura Elvize has told me so much, you're like an old friend Although I've only known you for two days Thank you, Laura - It must be great living here - It is... But I could live anywhere with Elvize You know something, Emanuelle... When I asked Laura to marry rne I thought she was just a shop girl Then he discovered I was the bosses' daughter What a romantic story Marriage is a romantic story, I recommend it, my dear Everyone should try it at least once Well, my views on that subject are very different Your friend Bill who's coming tomorrow... he's just a colleague, or are you engaged? Not exactly It's a very special relationship. We're both very liberated I understand your wish to be free but you don't know what you're missing N0thing's better than an evening at home with your husband Every evening? N0, we have many social engagements... events, parties, theatre... Why do you laugh? Is it funny? I feel I should touch you t0 see if you're real You're the very image of the ideal couple Thanks Enough! I've had it, alright? Had it! - I won't allow it - Really? Who's going to stop me? You?? Don't make me laugh Laura! That's enough You've gone too far. This is grotesque It's your reaction that's grotesque - Grotesque and ridiculous - Enough, Laura! Go on, get out Out of here! Go on! Emanuelle... Come here Offer Emanuelle a drink Champagne? Yes, thanks The Venetian humidity makes it hard to sleep But you'll get used to it Sometimes it really gets to me On the other hand, it does wonders for the panorama Yes... but one of these days Venice will disappear Along with all of us Please excuse rne, l'm going for a bath Emanuelle, so beautiful You think I'm ridiculous? Too old... That I couldn't possibly satisfy you? Not at all. I find you fascinating I like you Just I find you... a bit hard to understand I want to discover who you are Not just the body To touch all of you I knew that this moment would come for us I'll love you like a woman I'm happy you came You know I can't stand t0 be away from you But how could you leave me all alone in New York? - You, alone? For how long? - A few hours... I had to console myself... thinking of you in those Venetian palaces Didn't that get boring? Not at all. There's an aspect of them that's not at all aristocratic You'd be surprised Right... Look, can you give me a second? Something I have to sort, I'll be right back - Bill - Yes? How long will you stay in Venice? Next flight to London, please Couldn't you stay a couple of days? Or even just one? Just a few hours between flights You know I have work to do Why come all this way for two hours? I can't stand being away from you So what can we do about it? Just feed the pigeons and see the tourist sights? We'll skip the pigeons and St Marks - OK, but where now? - Anywhere Like here... come on Sweetheart, I hate to go but my plane's leaving soon... A beautiful creature like you should not deny herself love She should yield to the thrust of the senses, sink into voluptuousness You need a man who can fully satisfy you A man like me... what can I do? Here, hold this I found you at last - D0 you know me? - N0, but I soon will... from now until forever. I am Antonio Ramirez Ah, good for you. So what now? Erm... Like a drink? That's all?

Nothing t0 be afraid of. Look I'm not here for work And I have no professional interest in your forgeries You're safe And if you manage t0 get one over on Van Deeren I'd find that very amusing Why should I trust you? What's the alternative? You could kill me That wouldn't help Half New York knows I'm here You think it's worth it? Anyway... half of these are genuine Belong to the family Yes, I know that How do you get them past customs? A noble title has its advantages Well, you're a real artist. They are perfect As perfect as your marriage - You're disappointed? - Not at all, I'm very happy It might have cast doubts over my aversion to marriage Maybe even changed my mind Come...

Attractive, intelligent, charming But with a strong sense of decency That's what you really think? It's just a feeling from talking to you You're not wrong I believe profoundly in this country and its values In our liberty and in our power, whatever our critics say D0 many think like you? Yes, but the youth are a problem Their heads are filled with pacifism and such notions What we need is a good war That would sort them out The ones who come back And those who don't would have done something useful... died for their country It's beautiful t0 hear such talk about America You must love your country very much Yes, it's a wonderful country You must be bored listening to me talk Not at all It's not every day I meet someone like you But now I must say goodbye Somewhere to go?

It's amazing being here with someone who's so... so sophisticated, so special... Tell me what you like Whatever it is, tell me what you want If we could... if we could try something more... something stronger, something forbidden... Seems you didn't like that I thought someone like you would have something sensational... something less banal But it d0esn't matter, come here... N0, no... Now for something I think you'll really like Something really strong... Just wait That was amazing Really fantastic You're amazing S0 are you I've never met a man like you before Those images, so real... like it was really happening S0 terrifying... but so exciting You ever see anything like that? In real life, I mean Never I wouldn't normally say this But I feel you'll understand me Sometimes I dream of living something as cruel as that Yes, it's horrible... but something about it thrills me... Excites me... Your dream could become reality Because... such things really do happen Where and when? For a middle-class American girl, like me... such things must remain a secret fantasy I can make that forbidden dream of yours a reality But it might terrify you The terror is what makes me excited What was it? A dream... 0r a nightmare? Such horrible sights Not a dream, or a nightmare Just a little powder LSD - Have you had it before? - N0, never So none of that was real? N0, my love But it was beautiful just the same You were very happy Yes, very happy I really felt it all, for the first time in my life S0 you'll come see me again? Of course, if you want And whenever you want Tomorrow we'll start off where we stopped today S0 it was just a waste of time Just a trip, right? You mean a drug trip? - You sure about that? - Yes And when I woke up it was just a nightmare The first failure of my career I should have listened to my friend, not my editor Look You think you can photograph a nightmare? What's this? This is amazing! So it was all real Totally real N0 surprise you remember it as a nightmare You were lucky to wake up - It has to be a first - It sure is The scoop of the century S0 everything I did wasn't in vain Well, it might be better if you go on thinking it was a nightmare - and forget the whole thing - What do you mean? - You're not scared to publish it'? - It's nothing to do with me But for the first time since I've been here... I was specifically told not to publish a story But don't worry, I'll keep it all in the archive... and let you know as soon as things change Hold on, I don't care about the archive Don't you understand if this isn't made public... other women could be killed? And we'd be complicit in all of that Please Emanuelle, there's nothing I can do And I don't like it any more than you You don't like it but you won't do anything about it Know what l'd like to do? Get a bomb... blow up you, the owners, the archives, the whole thing! Listen, take a few days off... and when you come back we'll talk about the whole thing A few days? I'm taking a week off... A month! A year, Five years, ten years. My whole life if I feel like it! And then I slammed the door and walked away from it Farewell Mr Editor!

The people here seem beautiful and healthy We'll eat like them and become even more healthy and beautiful We'll build a wonderful hut t0 live in Like we wanted to as children I'm the happiest woman in the world - What world? - I don't know, I've forgotten And I'll forget everything else that we don't need in paradise, like work, property, success, money...
