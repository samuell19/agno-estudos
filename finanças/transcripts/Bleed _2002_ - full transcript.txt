Dude, Tillie's parties are usually good, man. I just hope there are some hotties there this time. - There will be, buddy. - [Chris] Does your, uh, new skirt start today? - Yeah, she just got here. - [Chris] Bring her on Saturday, man. Best way to check out the merchandise is in a bathing suit. Or out of it, man. - Real classy, dude. - Excuse me, Mr. Banning? - [Shawn] Yes? - Miss Patterson's here to see you. - Hey, man, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later on. - All right, man. - All right. I'll see you later. - All right, bye. - Maddy, please. Call me, Maddy. - Shawn, pleasure. Here, I'm sorry. Here you go, have a seat. I'm normally not a messy person. - It's okay, it's really okay. - There were a couple sections I noticed here that weren't filled in. - [Maddy] Oh. - Yeah, under in case of emergency, please contact. - Right. - You haven't listed anyone. - I know, I don't really have anybody. - I'll tell you what. I'll fill in my name and information that way I can help if any-- - Well, actually, I think I can find somebody to put down. - No, it'll be fine, really. It's not a bother at all. - Thank you. - Okay, all finished. Now, let's go check out your office. - Oh my god. This is great. - Yeah. This used to be my office until about a week ago. There's a lot of good memories here. - Wow. This is my office. Welcome to my office. - All right, I'll let you go sit down for a minutes, okay? Do you wanna grab some lunch maybe later? - No, actually I brought some from home. - Okay, how about tomorrow then, my treat. - Sounds good. - Let me know if you have any questions, okay? - I will. Buh-bye. (piano playing) (laughing) (crickets chirping) (wine splashing) Congratulations, Maddy. Oh my god. I can't believe you guys did this. Congrats. Maddy, congratulations. We couldn't think of anyone more deserving than you. Love, Mom and Dad. Oh god. This is so sweet. It means so much to me, thank you. Okay, let's toast. To Maddy, we are so proud of you. Okay. Okay, let's eat. (dramatic music) (muffled screams) - [Woman] Murderer! (gasps) (sighing) - [Maddy] So is there anything I should know about the office? - Like what? - You know, like office politics. Who should be avoided, who can be trusted. You know, that sorta thing. - There's actually some important information you should know. One of our employees was murdered last week. - What? - Yeah, Todd Reynolds. He was leaving a party at Montebello and he was killed. - Oh my god. - He used to do my job, actually. That's why I got the new office. In fact, you were hired for my old job. - Really? Did you know him very well? - No, I mean, he was brought in as my boss a couple months ago, but I really didn't know him outside the nine to five routine. - Hm. - I mean, not only was he sliced open right there in the street, but a friend of his and his girlfriend were killed, too, that night. (birds chirping) - God. Welcome to Hollywood. - Yeah. Changing the subject, would you like to have dinner with me sometime? - Perhaps. - Perhaps? What kinda answer is perhaps? - It's the only kind you're gonna get right now. - Well, how 'bout I say I'm not gonna take no or even maybe for an answer right now? - Okay. Not Taco Bell. - You sure? - Yeah. (crickets chirping) - [Shawn] Let's go. (laughing) - Uh, excuse the mess. - Whatever. - Isn't that what I'm supposed to say? - Whatever. Whatever. - Whatever? - Mm-hmm. - Whatever. Whatever. What are you doing, are you hot? - Yeah, it's kinda hot. You can ride with me. Really warm. (moaning) (laughing) - What? What? - You tickled me. - I was gonna say, you're not supposed to be laughin' right now. (laughing) - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? - Yeah. - You should be. - Tell you what. - What? - Why don't we go in the bedroom? - God, yeah. One second. - Okay. - Give me one second. - That's my kinda man. - I hope so. - I know so. I hope so, too. - I know so. (dramatic music) - [Woman] Todd? Is that you? (screaming) (gasping) - It's just a dream. It's okay now. Are you okay? It's just a dream, are you okay? - Oh, Jesus. (sighing) - You were about to give me a heart attack. Are you okay, now? - Yeah. - Are you sure? - I'm okay. - You wanna tell me about it? Hm? - No. No, it's okay. It's okay. - Okay, suit yourself. I gotta get goin'. - You want some coffee? - Thanks, but, really, I gotta get goin'. - Suit yourself. (crickets chirping) - I would like to see you again. (laughs) What? - You will, this morning, at the office. - You know what I mean. - Yeah, I know what you meant. I do, too. I had a really great time last night. I just, um. I hope you don't think I'm using you or anything. - I don't. Last night we just had this connection. This whole week's pretty magical. - Yeah, like the newest ride at Disneyland, right? - Look, I know it sounds corny-- - No, I am kidding, I am kidding. I know. - I'd like you to meet some of my friends. A friend of mine, Tillie, is having this party. Tomorrow. She got this big ass house. She got a hot tub, a pool. It'll be a lot of fun. - Okay. - A lot of fun. - Sounds good. - I really wasn't sure you should meet my friends just yet, but. - No, it's fine. I'd like to go. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Great, I gotta split. - Okay, go! - Push me into this door. - Goodbye. - See you later. - See you soon. - Bye-bye. * I wanna make your body move * Take you higher * Take you higher * Take you higher * Take you higher * Take you higher * Take you higher * Take you higher * Take you higher * Take you higher * Take you higher - Woo, welcome, welcome, come on in. You can put drinks over there. How you doin'? - Sorry we're late. - Oh, it's okay, the party hasn't even started. Nobody's naked yet. (laughs) - Oh! (roaring) - What's up, Keith? - What's up, guys? (claps) - What's up, man? - Right on, man. - What up? - Good to see ya. - What you up to? - So how's that new promotion treatin' you? - Shit, when you gonna get a raise? I got some bills, brotha! - Shut the fuck up. (laughs) - They ever catch that killer yet? - No, not yet. - Man, that's fucked up. How hard can it be to catch some dumb fuck that has a thing for trannies? - Shit, I don't know. - Man. - Hey, Shawn. - Hey, sweetie, what's up? - Hey, I'm not here, am I? - Dude. - I need to put lotion on my back. Let's go. - Bye, Keith. (laughing) - He is so fucking wimpy. - Yeah. Speaking of. - What? - Tell me about your date. - It was good. - And? - Maddy's nice. - Oh blah blah blah. - What about the sex? - What? - Come on, was it hot? She kinky, isn't she? Come on, dude. - You need to get fuckin' laid. (blubbering) I'm working on it. - I don't know. - Ah. - She's gonna be here later, so I need you to be cool, for real. Serious. - Of course, dude. What's my name, come on. - I'm serious. - Shit. Imma go get another beer, you want one? - Yeah, while you're out. - Same thing. - All right. (rock music) * I heard you on the radio * I don't know what to say to you * * I thought I'd turn a little bit * - Hello, gorgeous. (splashing) - Hello. Did I miss anything? - I don't know, did you miss me? - Oh, you're all wet. (laughs) It's a pool party. How was your day? - It was good. - Here comes the man candy! (shouts) (splashes) - Yeah, very funny. - Oh my god. - Such a jerk. - You must be Maddy. - Yes, I am. - Be gentle. - I'm Chris, but most folks call me Big Chris. - Hi Big Chris. (laughing) - Ah ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah, laugh it up, all right, ha ha ha. Somebody give me a beer 'cause it's naked time! (shouts) - Woo! - Woo hoo. * And now it's up to you * Whatever you want to do - Are you okay with this? - Yes, I am. - Good lord. I leave for a second and look what happens. - Oh shit. (splashing) - Hold this, would you? - Yeah. - Well, hello. I'm, Tillie, welcome to my orgy. I hope you're not too frightened. - No, I am not frightened, thank you. - Thanks, doll. - What? I don't. - What was that? - What? - What do you mean what? - What? - Forget it. - What, she pushed. What? - Mind if I join you? - No, go right ahead. - Thanks. - Shawn's really great, huh? - Yeah, I like him. - We dated for a while, but it didn't work out. - Really? - Yup, he decided we were better off friends than lovers. But I'm really glad you're happy. - Stop right there. Are you telling any more of your lies? - Why lie when then truth is so much better? I need a refill. - Go. (sighs) - Sheesh. Are you having fun? - Oh, yeah, havin' a great time. - What did Tillie say? - Not too much, it was just girl talk. - Did she tell you we used to date? - Yeah. - I think she still wants me. (laughs) - No kidding. - Seriously, though, don't believe everything she tells you. - Why should I, should I believe you? - Yeah, just. I got nothin' to hide. Woo! (splashes) - Boys will be boys. - Hey, Maddy, come on in. - We're not done talking yet. - [Shawn] Yes you are, come on in, honey. - Sorry. I can't refuse a naked man that calls me, honey. - It's cold, it's cold. - Oh, make me warm, thank you. (laughs) (yelling) - Chris, Chris! (yelling) - Ah! - Chris. - What the fuck? - To the victor go the spoils! (laughing) - Get it! Get it! For a dude without pants, it's not funny. - Not till I see her tits. - [Maddy] Get it back! - Let me see your boobies! - Get it back, Shawn! (laughing) - [Chris] No, I wanna see her tits. - Yeah, Chris, you wanna see tits? Well, there they are. And fuck, you, Chris! Fuck, you, too, Shawn. Thanks a lot! - Maddy! - [Man] Woo! - Ah, shit. - You in the dog house? - Yup, how'd you know? - I am, too. (laughing) - So be it. - Boo! (shouts) (laughs) - What is this, the Romper Room or something? - Truce. - Truce. - Let me make it up to ya. - I'm afraid to ask how. - A dance, my lady. A flower for the pretty lady? - Oh. (sighs) (humming) (laughing) (neighing like a horse) (laughing) (guitar playing) - The reason why I've called you all in here today is that I have Herpes. It's curable, but highly contagious in water. - [Woman] Ill, gross, shut up! - Guys, be sensitive. I mean, Chris over here really does have Herpes, right? Tell 'em. - Fuck you, man, my shit is clean! Hey, you wanna see? - No no no. (laughing) - That's what I thought. - Sit your ass down. - That's what I thought. - So how long you guys have been friends? - Last week, isn't that it? - You're so lucky to have such a good group of friends. - Ah, well, thanks, Maddy. How about you, do you have many friends? - Not really, I travel around a lot, you know. Actually, the date that I went on with Shawn last week was the first one I've been on in about a year. - A year, that's more pathetic than me, you know? - No, she's not. - Really? - Not even close. - Shit, I thought I was gonna lose my title there. - To answer your question, Chris and I were roommates. We used to work together. - Till they fired me! Oh, I'm sorry, laid me off. - And as you already know, Shawn and I used to date. Laura and I were roommates a few years ago, and her and Peter were high school sweethearts. - Well, thank you for inviting me to this. This is a really great party. - [Tillie] My pleasure. - Shawn, did you tell Maddy about our club yet? - No, not yet. - What? - Nothin'. - What club? - It's nothin'. - Fine, don't tell me then. - It's all right. - It's nothin'. - It's the Murder Club. - Oh, that club. No, I hadn't told her yet. - You can't be serious. - Oh, dead serious. - It's no big deal though. I mean, it's like a hobby. It's no big deal. - You know what, guys, I think I'm gonna get that beer. (splashing) - I don't understand, the Murder Club? - Yeah, you see, when me and Shawn were roommates we didn't have much money. - Yeah. You see, so we had to steal pretty much everything. You know, food, supplies. - Beer, don't forget the beer. - And beer. But, after a while we started like, you know, gettin' into the thrill of it. - God, the fuckin' adrenaline rush, woo hoo! Okay, so it was my idea to take it to the next level, so the next beer run I went on I took a gun. - Which brings us to level two, armed robbery. - Uh huh, yeah. - Now, instead of us like sneakin' around, we would feed off the fear of our victims. - Oh, man. I mean, this fuckin' one time, I came so fuckin' close to poppin' this guy, it was better than sex, I swear to god. - No, dude, I think that's because you're doin' it wrong. (mocking laughter) - That's where I came in. Shawn and I were dating and I caught him one night with a gun in his pants so I asked what he was doin'. - So what'd you do? - What do you think I did? I took the gun and ran to the nearest 7-Eleven. Boy, were they right about the adrenaline. I ran home and told Laura and Peter. - I came up with the idea of calling it a club. - The Murder Club. - Yeah. - Not yet. See, now, this was just the Gangsta Club. - Let's work. (laughs) - For real, I mean you guys were like a Wild West gang? - Nah, this was just for fun, not for profit. (laughing) - So we had level one, basic shoplifting, level two, armed robbery. - And then we added level three. - Murder. - Damn right murder. - So you've all killed someone before? - Well, that's how you become a member. - But it's not that big of a deal any more. - Hey, once a member, always a member. - Shawn, did you kill somebody? - Hell yeah, he has, he's a charter member. - That's me. - Oh my god. - No one's ever been caught. - Well, see, that's where the club comes in. - We provide air-tight alibis when needed. - Shawn, who did you kill? - Which time? - The first time was an accident. I was performing a level two on this guy, he was at this ATM, and he just like turned and he came at me. The gun just went off. - Came over to my house covered in blood. I saved him, gave him his alibi. Chris helped him dispose of the gun and clean up his car. - Yeah, you guys were a great help. (crickets chirping) - But I don't understand. - Well, we were all insanely jealous. I mean, he reached level three before us. - I was still at level one at the time, I just couldn't bring myself to carry a gun. - This is just all to freaky for me. - It was for me too, at first, but I came around. In fact, by the end of the first week, I was on level two on my way to a level three, right? - [Chris] Yeah, yeah, that's right. - But don't you think you'll get caught? I mean, how can you trust me, you don't even know me. - But I know you. (Chris laughs) - We'd all like to get to know you. - Shut the fuck up. - I think what bothers me the most about this is it doesn't really bother me that much at all. - Damn, that's my kinda woman. - So who was the first person you killed, Chris? - Oh, I mean, as you can imagine I had to catch up to Shawn. - Like always. - So that night I went out and popped this guy in his car. I mean, it was awesome. So I push his car down this guardrail right into the river. - Does he always use a gun? Everyone uses a gun? - Nah. For the first one it's easier 'cause you're not so connected to the victim, you know? - [Peter] Shit, for my first I used an ax. - That's right. - That's right. - Laura and I were on vacation at this Bed and Breakfast up north, stole an ax from the woodshed and headed into town. Find some homeless guy in the alley, chopped him up like firewood. (laughs) - Oh my god, that's horrible. - Is it, really, I mean the dude was homeless. - I heard that. (laughing) - I'm overwhelmed. - That's okay, you don't have to join your first visit. - What? - He means, this ain't Scientology. We won't force you to join. (laughing) - Yeah, you know what, it's my turn to go piss. - Shake it more than three times, you're playing with yourself. (splashing) - You can't be serious. I mean, the Murder Club? - Fine, I mean, hey, don't believe us, but some of our parties are members only, right guys? - So did any of you guys do in the guy from the office? - Oh, no no. See, that's a rule. We never kill anyone we know. - Never say never, Chris. - I'd kill the first person who said something behind my back. - Okay - Okay. - I think it's time to go. - All right. - Yeah. (laughing) - Okay. - Oh shit. - Hey, Maddy, you're not gonna tell anybody about our club, are you? - They wouldn't believe me anyway. - Maddy, be good to the club because you never know when you're gonna need the club to be good to you. - Okay. (splashes) - Just a little bit, so what? (beeping) You sure I can't come over tonight? - Shawn, I've got a lot to do tonight, okay? - Just for an hour, please? - Seriously, I'm so tired. I've gotta go shopping, I've got errands. Don't make a little baby face. Come on, now, it's not gonna work. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - Fine. I'll just go to the Pleasure Chest and get some porn. - Do what you gotta do. - Maddy? - What? - Drive safe, I'll see ya tomorrow. - Okay. - Unless you cancel that, too. - Shawn? - What? - Grow up. You can spend one night alone, can't you? - Yeah, but I'd just rather spend it with you. (sighing) (crickets chirping) - Till tomorrow, okay? - All right. Good night. - Good night. - Drive safe. (engine revving) (moaning) - I hate you, you make me sick! - Fuckin' bitch! You're a whore. - Fucker! - Shut up, bitch! - I'll make you bleed. (moaning) (dramatic music) (moaning) - Oh my god. (snapping) (gasping) (breathing heavily) - [Woman] You Jezebel. - [Man] The Murder Club. - [Woman] Murderer. - [Man] You're father was a killer. - [Woman] You slut! - [Man] We're going up the right street. - [Man] The Murder Club. - [Woman] Murderer. Murderer. My daughter is a murderer. (birds chirping) (crow cawing) (phone ringing) (banging) (phone ringing) (door slamming) - Hello? Hey girl, how are you? - Oh, you're coming in to town? Great. - [Maddy] Jesus. - Great, great. - Excuse me. - Yeah, where you have to go to get it? - I said excuse me. (door slamming) I said excuse me. - I am on the phone. - No, you're not. (smashing) - Fuckin' bitch! - Fuckin' bitch! Fuck! You fuckin' bitch! (cracking) (splattering) (grunting) (cracking) (dramatic music) - [Woman] Murderer, murderer! Murderer! (breathing heavily) Murderer! - What is wrong with me? - [Man] The Murder Club. What is wrong with me? (whimpering) - [Woman] Murderer. Murderer! My daughter is a murderer. - [Man] Maddy, be good to the club. - Shut up. - [Man] Because you never know when you're gonna need the club to be good to you. - Shut up. - [Woman] You are a whore. Murderer. - [Man] The Murder Club. - I can't even think. Can't come up. This can't come up again. - Murderer! Murderer! - What're you gonna do? - [Woman] My daughter is a murderer. - [Man] Maddy, you gotta be good to the club because you never know when you're gonna need the club to be good to you. (sniffling) (knocking) - Maddy? You okay? Came as quick as I could. - I did it. - You did what? Oh my god, Maddy. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Maddy, what did you do? - I killed her. - What? Who? - No one, just, just some woman. - We gotta get you cleaned up. - No, see, I left the blood on so that you'd believe me. - What are you talkin' about? - For the Murder Club. I'm a member now, right? - What? - I'm a full-fledged member, right? (sighing) - Maddy, well, what happened? - She dinged my car with her door so I killed her. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I bashed her brains in, you know. I just. I bashed her brains in. - Come on. Come on, come on. - I just hate that you weren't there to see me. You would have been so proud of me. (water running) - Maddy, why would you do this? - I told you why, she dinged my car. - All right. Did anyone see you? I mean, where did this happen? - It was at the parking garage at the store. - Yeah. - I don't think anybody saw me. - And then what? - I woke up and there was blood everywhere. But I think we need an alibi. You know? - What? - I don't know, but we need to get our stories straight. - You really got this worked out, don't you? - I think Tillie should be the alibi. That would be better, right? - Whatever you say. - Fuck me, honey! - What? - Make love to me right now. - I can't. I can't, okay? - Why not? - I have to go home. - Who's breaking our date now? - Maddy, I have some reports I have to get done by tomorrow morning. - You're mad at me, aren't you? - Why would you say that? - You didn't want me to join your Murder Club, did you? - Maddy, it was a secret, okay? Besides, you should get some sleep. Lean back, come on. I'll figure out we need to do, okay? - I can help you. - No, I have more experience with this than you do. You just rest. I'll take care of everything. Hey, Chris, thanks for calling back. Hey, man, we got some trouble. Yeah, Maddy, she fuckin' killed a woman. I don't know. We gotta get together and discuss. I thought of that, but let's just wait and see. I know. Who'd have believed us, we were drunk! The Murder Club, come on? I know that, we were fuckin' with her. I thought she knew we were kidding. Dude, your sick, be serious. All right. I'll see you tonight. All right, bye. - I'll get a rough draft to you by Wednesday, then you can have more time to work on it. - I like the way you think. She's got a real killer instinct here. Thanks, Maddy. I'll see you later. Bye-bye. - So how's it goin'? - It's good. - I haven't seen you all morning. You okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - It's just I'm worried about you. - I said I'm fine. I have a lotta work to do now. I just wish you would go. - This isn't like you, Maddy. What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong. Look, if you wanna meet me for lunch, alone, we can talk. Right now, I have way too much work I have to do. - Wait, I can't because I'm having lunch with a client today. - How 'bout dinner, my house? - Uh, I told Chris I was gonna meet him at the gym tonight. I can't. - Mm, okay, whatever. Just let me know. - Don't be like that. We can just get together after the-- - Just look, I'm fine, I said I'm fine. I have a lotta work to do. I would just appreciate it if you went. - Okay. I'm working on that other thing, too. - What thing? - You know, the dent in your car. I'm working on that. - Okay, fine. (dramatic music) Just go. (birds chirping) - I didn't get you a beer. What do you think that is? - Where the hell have you been? - I'm sorry, I just had to make sure that Maddy left the office before I did. - What up? - So you wanna tell me what the hell is going on, bro? - Chris, did you tell him anything? - Nope, it's all you, buddy. - Is this about Maddy? - Yeah, look, I think we're all in big trouble. - How? - You remember the other night we were all just sittin' around talkin'? - Yes. - And we told Maddy about the club? - Yeah. - Maddy killed someone. - What? - A woman. - Wait a minute, we were fucking with her. - Oh my god. - It was just a joke. (laughs) - Yeah, man, she offed some bitch at the store that dinged her car. - Oh, that's terrible. - Wait a minute, Shawn, it was a fucking joke. - I know it was a joke, but we never told her it was a fucking joke. - What, that makes it our fault? - Well, we kinda dared her to do it. - I didn't. - Fuck you, you didn't. You were the first one who started this whole thing. - Oh, whatever. - So did you call the police? - No, not yet. - Why not? - Because we are accomplices. - The hell we are, dude. - How do you figure that? - We dared her to do this, to join. - I understand that, but we were fucking with her. - Peter, she didn't know we were fucking with her. If she goes to the cops, they may see her side of it. - So what do we do? - We gotta do something. - I don't know. - Why don't we just forget about it? - And then what if she gets caught? - Well, then, you get yourself a new girlfriend. (laughs) - Yeah, so does she, in prison. - That's so not funny. - The way I see it, we have three options. The first choice, we go to the cops and we just take our chances. - [Peter] Sounds good to me. - The second choice is that we forget about everything. I'll tell Maddy it was a joke. I won't tell on her. I won't go to the cops or nothin'. - Okay, next option. That's not gonna work. - Well, the third choice, we pretend that there is a Murder Club only we know that Maddy's the only member, but we all have to protect her. We give her an airtight alibi and strike any evidence that there is a against her. - Then we really are accomplices. - Look, dude, I'm sorry, but she's your fuckin' girlfriend so she's your fuckin' problem. - No, Peter, we're all involved in this, like it or not. - Tillie's right, we're in this together. - Okay, well, what are we gonna do? - I like the third option. I mean, in fact, once we get the club setup I got a few people I'd like to kill, too. - That is so not funny, Chris. - I'm meeting with Maddy tomorrow night so we have to kinda decide something right now. Or at least by tomorrow morning. - Can you imagine if she found out we were kidding? - I know, she'd have to kill us to hide her secret. - [Shawn] Chris, would you be fuckin' serious for a sec. - [Chris] I am. - Let's take a vote on this. - Vote on what? - Well, choice one, the police. Choice two, we just forget everything. Or choice three, the Murder Club. - Three. - I vote on two, I don't wanna get involved. - Guys, one is clearly the only option. - I'm with Peter. I mean, at least if we go to the police now we can tell our side of the story before it's too late. - Okay, we all have to agree here. If one person gonna go to the cops then we're all just gonna get turned in. - Yeah, because I just do not have the waistline for an orange jumpsuit. I don't look good, I had a lot of bagels this morning. - Why don't we do this? Why don't we all sleep on it tonight and tomorrow morning we'll call Shawn and we'll let him know what we're gonna do. - Yeah, yeah, wait, but if one person goes to the police, we all go down, okay? - For what, joking at a party? - [Shawn] Clearly we didn't kill anyone ourselves. But we are still to blame for this. - [Tillie] I don't think sweet little Maddy woulda killed anybody if we hadn't been fucking with her. - [Shawn] Thank you. - Look, I know we were all there, but that doesn't change the fact that a woman is dead. - Oh, lighten up, Laura. People die every day. - Hey, look, dickhead. I'm telling you right now. - Okay. - [Peter] If you don't-- - We're entitled to our feelings here, guys, but this decision is gonna affect all of us. That's why we're here, that's why we're discussing this. - You're right. - So let's do what Tillie says. Just go home tonight, we'll sleep on it. Tomorrow morning, you guys give me a call on my cell. Just give me your answers. Agreed? - Agreed. - Agreed. - Chris! - Sure. - Fine. - Great. Now, just try to think with an open mind. 'Cause Maddy's my friend. Maddy's our friend now. She trusts us, guys, and we owe her our loyalty. All right? - [Chris] Later, I'm outta here. (birds chirping) - Bye. - Come on, Shawn. - All right. - All right. - All right, I'll see you guys later, all right? (birds chirping) (crickets chirping) (birds chirping) (splashing) - Honey, are you coming? - How's the water? - You know, it's a little brisk, but you'll get used to it. - A little, it's freezing in here. - Hey, come here, I'll keep you warm. (shivering) Damn, look at the stars tonight. You know, they're like tiny angles staring down at us. (laughs) - Yeah, the little tiny angels all say you're going to hell for not calling the police. - Wait, what? - Just feeling guilty, that's all. What else is new? - Okay, you know, we can go to the police if you want to. - I know, I know, but all the others. - Listen, we have to decide based on what we want. Okay, you and I. I mean, I'm sorry, but the hell with the others. (laughs) - Honey, how can you say that? They're our friends. - Yeah, they're our friends that got us into this mess, Laura. - Excuse me, but I believe someone killed a homeless man with an ax. - Whatever. - Not whatever, look, we were all there, okay? I just, I don't wanna make some horrible mistake, that's all. What was that? (dramatic music) - I don't know. All right, I'll go check it out. Hey, don't worry. I'm sure it's just an animal or something. (crickets chirping) (shivering) - Peter? Peter? Peter, what's going on? (shouts) (splashing) Goddammit, Peter, you scared me! - I know, I'm sorry. - What was it? - [Peter] I don't know. - Opossum, I guess. (dramatic crescendo) (screaming) (dramatic music) (whimpering) - Please, somebody help me. Please, somebody help! Please don't, please, please. Please don't, please don't, please don't. Please don't, please don't, please don't. (electric shocking) (crickets chirping) - Hello, Shawn. - Jesus Christ! Maddy, I didn't see you there. - Sorry. - How you doin'? - [Maddy] Good. Better. - That's good. - How was the gym last night? - Huh? - [Maddy] The gym, you went with Chris, right? - Yeah, it was crowded, took forever. - How was your night? I tried to call you, but you weren't home. - Didn't have any message on my machine. Your number wasn't on my caller ID. - Oh, I called from my cell phone. I didn't wanna bother you. - Well, I got dinner at Del Taco then I went to bed early. The ringer on my phone was turned off. - Oh. - So I guess we're on for tonight then, - Yeah, sure, definitely. - Great. I miss you. - I miss you, too. - Oh, um, what did the others say? - What? - The Murder Club, what did they say about me becoming a member? - I haven't told 'em yet. - Not even Chris at the gym? - No, there was like no time. - Well, let me know what they say. I'm sure they'll be very surprised. - Shawn. - Yes, Maddy. - I have to find the files for George on the manufacturing costs and-- (phone ringing) - Excuse me. Hello. Yes. Wait, hold on one second. I need to take this in my office, okay? I'll stop by your office in a little bit. Yeah, Tillie, sorry about that. No, she was just here. No, I have no-- (gasping) - Maddy, how's it going? (sighs) - Good, thank you. (dramatic music) - Oh my god, Laura. - I know, just get some rest. (heels clicking) - God help you. - I'm sorry. - That's not enough. The good lord tells us murder is a sin. - [Maddy] I didn't murder anybody. - It's the worst sin that you can commit. - [Maddy] Mom, please! - Maddy, you are a whore. Pregnant, wasn't that enough for you to destroy our family? - [Maddy] I didn't destroy our family, Mom. - Oh, of course you didn't. I, I, I, you only think of yourself, you slut. But, no, whore was too good for you, Jezebel, so you killed your baby. - It was an abortion, mother. - Murderer, murderer. My daughter is a murderer. (sobbing) - I just can't take this. I can't take this. This is too much for me. - You shoulda thought about that before. Did you think you could keep this from us? From God? - No, that's not what I meant. - [Mother] Well, what is it? Your eternal soul is damned to hell. - Mom, please! - The Bible is very clear. I can't do anything to help you now. That bastard child was one thing, but this! - Mom, people do this all the time. - And that's why hell is full! We didn't raise you to be like this. You are a murderer. - Maybe the Bible's wrong. (gasps) - Get out! (groans) - Phyllis, wait, please. - Carl, our daughter is a murderer. - Mom, please. - You're mother and I we're, we're only trying to do what's best for you. - Get out of our house. - Daddy, please. - Phyllis, she's, she's our daughter. She's still our daughter. - No, our daughter is dead, dead to us and dead to God. - Maddy, ask God for forgiveness. Ask God for forgiveness, now! - I said, get out! I want you out of my house this instant. - Mom, please. I am not your mother anymore. Get out! - I hate you, I hate you both! - How can we face our friends in church, now? Our daughter is dead. (speaking Spanish) - What? - Lady, wake up, this is my car. (birds chirping) - Oh. I'm, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Tillie? Tillie? Oh my god, Tillie! (dramatic music) Oh my god! Tillie! (gasping) Oh my god! Oh! Shawn. Oh my god! Oh, Shawn. Oh my god! Oh, oh! (knocking) (knocking) - Hold on. - Oh my god, Chris, thank god you're home. - Maddy, what is it? - Oh god. It's Tillie. - What? - Tillie's dead. - Oh, are you sure? - Yeah, I saw her. - [Chris] What did you see, Maddy? - Shawn did it. - What? - Shawn killed her. - Whoa, Shawn, well, why would you say that? - Because I was watching the house from across the street and after he left, I went in and I saw her body. It was awful. Oh my god, whoa, sit down, sit down. It's gonna be okay, all right? Let me get you something to drink, all right? One second. Here you go. Sorry, it's all I have. - It's okay. - You know, Maddy, Shawn told us you killed someone. - I know he told you. - Did you really do that? - Yeah, but it was, it was an accident. - What? - I was fighting with this woman in this parking garage and I took her head and I hit it against the cement, but I didn't mean to kill her. - Man, Shawn told us that-- - No, I know, I just. I just wanted to join the club, you know? I just wanted you guys to like me. I just wanted Shawn to like me. - Yeah, Maddy, about the club. - I know, you guys made it all up. - Look, I'm sorry, okay. We were just fucking around. - It's too late. Besides, Shawn has gone crazy or something. - I can't believe Shawn would kill Tillie. - He did. He slit her throat, there was blood everywhere. - But you're okay now, though, okay? Come here. - No, Chris. I can't. I'm sorry. I can't do this. - Fine, fine, fine. I'll go get dressed. We'll go see if we can find Shawn, okay? - Chris, you believe me, right? - You know what, I don't know what to believe anymore, Maddy. - I mean, this doesn't sound like Shawn and there's gotta be an explanation. I don't know, I have no idea. - Well, you know that I didn't do this, right? Chris, you know, I heard Tillie say something about Laura. - What about Laura? - I don't know, I couldn't hear the conversation, but she said something about Laura. - So what do you wanna do, Maddy? - I think we should go over to Peter and Laura's. See what they know. - Okay. (dramatic music) - Laura! Peter! - Yo, Pete. - Are you home? - Pete, where are you? - Laura! - No, Maddy. Oh my god. - Oh my god. - This is horrible. Maddy, no. Oh my god. Maddy, come here. - Did Shawn do this, too? - Why would you say that? - Who else? - I don't know. We can call him, ask him, I don't know. - He wouldn't tell us anyway. - Well, he's not guilty until proven innocent. Can't say that. - I gotta get outta here. I gotta get outta here. - All right, hold on, whoa. Hey. So now what, Maddy? - If Shawn didn't do this, then who did? - I don't know. - We need proof, you know, something. He's never gonna admit that he did this. - No, he's not. - So what are we gonna do? - I don't know, we can check his apartment or something. - No, he left work early today. He's probably already home by now. - Well, what about tonight? - Yeah. He's coming over for dinner. You can sneak into his apartment. - Well, what am I looking for, Maddy? - I don't know, like a murder weapon, blood, evidence. I'll keep him busy and you can check his apartment out. - Wait, but is that safe? - Maddy, are you gonna be all right with him? Huh? - I can take care of myself. Besides, he doesn't know that I know. - Look, I'll work fast, okay, so you don't have to be with him any longer than you have to be. All right? - Chris, I think we should just stay focused, okay? - Fine. (engine starting) (dialing) (phone ringing) - Hello. - Shawn? - [Shawn] Maddy, how you doin'? - Fine, how are you? - Good, I'm busy. - Are we still on for tonight? - [Shawn] Yeah, sure. - Great. - [Shawn] Your place at seven. - Yeah, that's right. - All right, bye. (birds chirping) - See you then. (knocking) - Hey, you. - Hey, thank you. - You're welcome. - So how you been? Is wine okay? - Yeah, sure, that's good. I'm fine. How are you holdin' up? - Good, couldn't be better. - Look, Maddy, while we got a moment, I think we gotta figure out what we're gonna-- - No no no no no no no no no. I just wanna have a nice relaxing dinner date tonight, okay? - All right, I think we should discuss what we're gonna do-- - No no. Come on. (sighs) - So what's new with you? (dramatic music) - Not much. And you? - I can't do this, Maddy, I can't. We have too much to discuss, I can't do this. - No, not now, Shawn. - I don't understand you. What is wrong with you? You can talk to me. - I just wanna have a nice relaxing evening with you. - We can't. That's all changed now. (phone ringing) - Um, get me some wine, I'll answer the phone. (phone ringing) - Hello. No, thank you. Not interested, thanks. - Who was that? - Just a survey, they always call during dinner. - Maddy, what's goin' on here? - I don't know what you mean. - God, I don't get you. We were so good together. - We still are. - No. I don't think so. What's that smell? - It's the food. Hold on, I hope it's not burning. - Chris. What the fuck? - What's wrong? - Look, Maddy, I got something I gotta do. - What about dinner? - I gotta go. I gotta go. (birds chirping) (beeping) - Maddy, hey, it's Chris. Hey, you okay? All right, hey, look, I'm on my way so just wait there for me, all right? All right, bye. (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) - Shawn? Shawn? Did you forget something? (dramatic crescendo) (muffled groans) (knocking) - Maddy. - No, Shawn. No, no! - Please. - No, get away from me! I know. - Know what? - You killed those people. - Look, this isn't mine. - Get back! You killed Tillie. - No, Tillie's not dead. - Yes, she is. After you left, I went over to her house and I found her by the pool. - No, she's not. - [Maddy] And Peter and Laura. - Peter and Laura were dead when Tillie and I got there. - Liar! - No. - Yes, just like you lied about the Murder Club. - It's Chris, he's the fucking-- - No, it's not! No, it's not. - I just left his house, Maddy. I just left his house. - What, did you kill him, too? - No, but this is where I found this covered in blood. - Chris wouldn't do that. - But you think I could? Maddy, listen to me. - Just get outta my house! Get outta my house! - Maddy, I'm here to protect you, just come before Chris gets here. - Get outta my house! - Listen to me! - No! - Just get back, I'm warning you. - Please, look at me. Trust me. (whacking) - Ah! (dramatic music) (moans) - Chris. - Thank god you're all right, Maddy. I didn't think I was gonna get here in time. - He was trying to say that you were the killer not him. - He was crazy, Maddy. Are you, okay? - Yeah. - Here. Whoa, look at that. Put that there, you don't need that anymore. Oh, come here. Oh, man. I did this for you, Maddy. - Oh, thank you. Thank you, he was going to kill me. I did it because I love you. Whoa, Maddy, I did it all for you. - What? - I love you. - Chris. I can't. - Why not? I thought we could just leave town together, you know. - What? - Go somewhere where no one will find us. - No, Chris, I can't. - Why not? - This is all too much for me. - Well, I'll take care of you, Maddy. - Come on. - I just need a minute to think, okay? - Oh, we don't have a minute. - No, please, one minute to think, please. Just one minute. - Okay, a minute then, but hurry up. - Okay, okay. (panting) Damn it! - Hey, Maddy. I knew I loved you when we first met. But it wasn't until you killed that bitch that I knew we were the same. A woman that can kill with her hands like that. I shot a load just thinking about it. (dialing) Maddy, who are you calling? (gasps) Come on, open the door. Come on, Maddy. I love you. I'm not gonna hurt you. - Go away. Please! - [Chris] Is that any way to treat me, Maddy? I saved your life. Shawn, was going to kill you. - No, he wasn't! - [Chris] Well, he was going to turn you into the police. They all were, Maddy, that's why they had to die. All for you, Maddy. What are you doing in there? Look, can't you see how happy we would be-- - No! No! (glass breaking) (panting) Ah! Ah! - Maddy, where are you going? Maddy? Aren't you ready to go yet? - Ah! (knocking) - [Maddy] Just go away! I won't tell anybody. - Tell what? You're a murderer, too, Maddy. See, we belong together, Maddy. Don't fight it. Open the door. Maddy, open the door. Okay. (hacking) (screaming) (hacking) (screaming) (hacking) (whimpering) - Ah! Ah! (hacking) Ah! - Oh, there you are, Maddy. - Please. Just leave me alone, please, please. - But we belong together. - Please. - You and I, and we like to make 'em bleed. We're killers. (groans) - Ah! Ah, ah! - Now, Maddy, that's gonna leave a mark. (dialing) Tired of fucking with you, Maddy. Maddy, no! - Fuck you, Chris! - [Operator] 911, what is your emergency? - Help me, please, help me! Somebody help me, send help now! - Maddy. - Calm down, Ma'am. - You are a murderer, too. - What's your situation? (crying) - Somebody's trying to kill me. - Maddy, what are you doing? - [Operator] Hello, I can barely hear you. Please speak up. - Just remember. - Hello? - You brought this on yourself. Hey, buddy, you need some help? - Yeah, hey, thanks. My tire iron's useless. - No problem, use mine. - Thanks. (dramatic music) Hey, thanks, I appreciate it. - Yeah, no problem. - My name's David. - I'm Shawn, nice to meet you David. - So, Shawn, where you headed? - My wedding. - Oh, sure, you gonna be late. - Ah, there's always time to help others, right? - You're a dying breed. I am headed to Vegas, man, I'm excited. - So where's the bride? - She's in the trunk. Kidding, she's meeting me there. - Cool. - Hey, thanks, I really appreciate it. - No problem, buddy. - David, what in the hell is taking so long? - We're done, we're finishing up. - Fine, I just don't wanna be late. - Oh, uh, Shawn, this is my wife Susan. Susan, this is Shawn, our good Samaritan. - Yeah, it's really nice to meet you. - You, too. - Shawn's going to Vegas to get married. - Yup. - Great, great. Congratulations, listen, we need to go now. - Hey, good luck with the wedding. - Yeah, thanks, drive careful, buddy. - Congratulations. (muffled screams) - See, honey, it's a great day for a wedding. You'll see one day. We belong together. (rock music) (tapping) Three more hours to Vegas, baby.
