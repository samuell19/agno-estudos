That's delicious. But it's undercooked. This is great. We made an Italian dish today. Since squid is known as good food for preventing adult diseases, it's good to eat it often. Wasn't it easy to make? Fresh squid for sale! Get them while you can! 6 for 10,000 won! -I'll take one! -Give me one! Here you go. Over here! Here you go. There's one bag left! Just a moment! Ladies, please listen to me! Today's my deceased wife's memorial! She really loved squid when she was alive. If you let me have this, I'll never forget your kindness. How much was it again? Squid again? I told you not to wear a suit while shopping for groceries. What do you mean, honey? This is my uniform. When I wear a suit to the market, I get a lot of discounts. I bought you that to get a job. Are you even looking for work? Taste this, honey. -No. -I made it. Honey, I want to eat cheonggukjang. Can you make it for breakfast tomorrow? I want fried calamari! Why do neither of you eat what I make? Fine. Da-na, I'll only make it for you if you eat all of your dinner. Okay! Let's eat. Da-na, eat everything. She should drink water first. Honey, are you getting a bonus this month? I knew you would ask. You women insist on driving everywhere now. THE DAY I MET SOO-HEE How dare you kick my car? -Do you want to die? -Go ahead! THE NIGHT DA-NA WAS CONCEIVED THE DAY DA-NA WAS BORN Don't scream. Try to breathe. Say, hi. -How cute. -Good girl. You're so adorable. We'll speak with our guest after the break. See you at eleven o'clock. The current time is eleven o'clock. SO-HEE GOES BACK TO WORK. Give us a raise, or we'll quit! THE DAY I RESIGNED BY MYSELF CONGRATULATIONS ON STARTING SCHOOL! Hello, my name is Da-na Jo. -Look over here. -Hello. The weather's great. -It's so nice. Wait for us! -Hurry up! You go ahead. I WAS ELECTED AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD REPRESENTATIVE. -Honey, where is my beige handbag? -Yes? Second drawer on the right. My earrings are missing. Honey, where are my pearl earrings? On the dresser! I found them! I tried to wake you up. You should've tried harder. -Honey. -Bye! Honey, eat this first! I made it for you! Just have a bite, honey. Sorry, it will ruin my lipstick. -You can reapply it. -Da-na! Just try it. Mommy is leaving. Bye, Mommy. -Hello? -Honey! I'm going out tonight. You have to pick Da-na up! Yes. I cooked it so well. It's delicious. -Daddy. -Yes? Don't you get bored at home? There's no time to get bored. Why? You don't like that I stay home? I do, but my friends tease me. They tease you because I stay home? Runny-nosed, ugly kids say that. But I don't care. Listen carefully, Da-na. When mommies are busy, daddies stay home. When daddies are busy, mommies stay home. In our family, Mommy is always busy, right? That's why Daddy always stays home. Who is teasing you? Who are their parents? -How cute. -Thank you. -Did you watch the drama yesterday? -Oh I did! The actor was very good at crying! -Are you talking about Proposal of Love? -You watched it? -With Ji-sub Oh? -He's so cool. -He's not that cool. -I think he's amazing. -He's so handsome. -I know. He's always crying. Jin-man, you're better than him. Why are you bringing me into it? -There's no one like him. -Right. -Have a good time. -Bye. -Eat your lunch. -Bye! Why were you doing this with your dad? I mean, your mom! Da-na has a dad -for a mom -A dad for a mom -A dad for a mom -A dad for a mom I don't have a mom! That's what I'm saying. -Here goes nothing. -That's the first card. -Come on! -He blew it. You blew it! Jin-man, aren't you blowing it too often? I don't like men who blow it too often. Sometimes a man has to blow it! -What is that? -Goodness! -Here! -Hey! -How many times is that? -There we go! -He got it back. -Hand it over. -Two cards apiece. -Hand over two cards. My hand is too big to wash this. Can someone else try? Let me try. It's too small. Let me see. Just use a brush to wash it. No. Boil water with potato peels. It will turn out spotless. Jin-man knows everything. He's amazing. That much is basic knowledge after six years of experience. -He's better than us. -I wish he was my husband. -Are you playing? -Yes. Come in. I fold. I forgot about my cabbage. I have to go. You can't fold after looking at your hand. I forgot about my cabbage. -I have to go. -Just play this round. Jin-man, are you trying to win money for dinner? -I'm not playing. I'm done. -Come on! He's such a homemaker. -Goodness, Jin-man. -No tip today. That's alright. Just give me this month's payment for Gye. -So soon? -Yes. It's finally my turn. Hello, Nam-kyu. Hello, Soo-hee. You must be busy since the program is doing so well. A little. What are you up to lately? The cooking show at six o'clock. It's still on? The ratings are improving. To be honest, I'd rather... Nam-kyu! I hear you're looking for a host on your new show. Please consider me. Have you had lunch yet? Sorry, but I have a shoot. Please welcome our guests on today's show. The cooking talk show, Delicious Story, starts now. Please welcome supermodel, Hwa-sun Lee! It's delicious! Why doesn't it taste this good when I make it myself? Kimchi is all about the jeotgal. Jeotgal made in June is called yukjeot. Jeotgal made in autumn is called chujeot. Jeotgal made in winter is known as dongbaekjeot. -When it comes to kimchi, -Yes? the kind made with yukjeot is the most delicious. Yukjeot, is it? Why aren't your daughters-in-law helping you make kimchi? They're all busy. Give me a break. After the kimchi's done, they will come begging. I don't have daughters, so what can I do? Fine, I'll act like your daughter then. So, if you have any complaints, let me know. What is it? Do you love me? I'm trying to figure out if you're my son or daughter. How long are you going to stay home? I'm happy living like this. If I'm happy, you're happy, right? You are just all talk. But if your father finds out, I'm done for. When you were born, he was so happy. He adored you as the first son. You never left his arms. If he knew you were making kimchi with me... Goodness, speak of the devil. What should I do? Goodness. Hello? What? You're on your way home? All right. Mom, I feel bad for not helping you. It's fine. Hurry up and go. Bye, Mom! Bye. He's finally speaking with an accent. Thanks for the kimchi. Take care of yourself. Okay, don't worry. I'll come again! Hurry up and go. -Did someone come? -You scared me! No one came. I just wanted some air. Let's go in. Go in. KARAOKE ROOM Do a good job! What a joke. I'm not going anywhere with you. Don't make assumptions, old man! Thank you very much! Did you think that's what I would say? Stop it! He hit me! How dare you hit me? Please calm down. Dong-chul, what's wrong with you? Are you taking her side? -Are you on your period or something? -Dong-chul! -Dong-chul! -Cut it out you assholes! Jin-man! Shouldn't you be serving your wife dinner? Go sing a lullaby for your daughter, loser. You finally got out of the house, so sit quietly and drink. Don't kill it. -Son of a bitch! -Hey! -Bastard! -Hey! -That's enough! -Let go! -Fucker! -Stop it! -Let go of me! -Jin-man! Who the hell invited him? You did! Did he pay his dues? -Son of a bitch! -Jin-man! -Come here! -Hey! -You think cooking is a joke? -Calm down! Didn't you grow up eating the food your mom made you? Don't look down on housework, bastard. Doing housework is a million times more meaningful -than screwing around with women like you. -Okay. -Let go! -Jin-man. Let go of me, punk! I have to take my kimchi home. Damn it. I better not run into you. I'll kill you. Fuck. God damn it! Damn. Daddy! Da-na. How could you drink after forgetting her? I told you I was going out. You were the one who didn't listen. Da-na isn't a baby. She can play at a friend's house. You promised to support me. How can I work like this? My show might get canceled. Please don't stress me out at home. You picked her up once. Don't make it such a big deal. Gosh. It's the perfect day to move in. -Hello. -Hello. Do you live around here? Yes, I'm the neighborhood representative. -Really? -If you have any issues, let me know. I live in unit 504. -All right. -That's right. The trash dumpster is behind the apartment. Leave food waste out on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. Okay, thank you. You picked a great floor. That's 13, 14... It's the 14th floor. Unit 1403. What a great view. Just a moment! Did you hear from Eun-jin's mom? She didn't call me either! What on earth is happening? Wait for me! Wait for me! What is this? What on earth? -No wonder her phone was off! -Oh, no! She wasn't there for the kindergarten bus either! -That's right. -She ran away? Ran away? -She wouldn't do that. -Oh, my goodness. -Oh, no! -Ma'am. Did the person who lived here leave her number? I heard she moved abroad. -Be careful with that! -How can this be? -We're in big trouble. -Oh, no! That's why you have to be careful when it comes to gye. Don't say that just because you got your money! -It's not that. -What do we do? Jin-man, what do we do? We will find her. We have to get our money. We will be able to get it back. I already got mine. Last month. What? What about you? I got mine a couple months ago. Everyone got their money except for me. Are you asleep? No. I want to tell you something. I'm tired. Can it wait until tomorrow? No. I couldn't do anything all day because of it. I can't sleep either. It's that urgent? Yes. Couples should be honest. Has it been that long? Honey, to be honest... It's not that. That's it. Honey! Mr. Kim, you never get in touch. He's a new actor. I'll give you a call. Thank you! Goodness. Hey, come here. -Nam-kyu! Hello, how are you? -Hi. Please have one. You always look great. He's a new actor. Please take a look. What does he do? Acting. I guess I can use him as an extra. Thank you! Good for you. You've got it made. -Let's meet up sometime. -Absolutely. See you later. Thank you. LOTTO DRAWING What? How much? -Thirty million won. -You're insane. -Hello! Every Saturday... -Don't say that. Help me out. I'm an agent, not a hedge fund manager. When you were being chased by loan sharks, I bailed you out. That was a century ago. I paid you back, didn't I? Why do you need it? As an investment, I joined a neighborhood gye. -The interest rate now is 4,25 percent. -She ran off with everything? She moved abroad. Good one. Nice going. What is wrong with you? How many numbers do I have to get to win? -At least three. -Three? The fourth ball is yellow. -I got four numbers. -The 4th number is 30. What? I have 34. The fifth ball is blue. -It's 34! You got it! -Number 34! The fifth one is 34. -I need a 43. -The sixth ball is green. -It's 43. -It's 43! It's 43! He won! No way! The timing is perfect! He won! Drinks are on us! Jin-man, let's go to the bank! -Don't forget me when you're rich! -No, this can't be. What? What do you mean? You won! -Oh man! -Oh, no. I just wrote them down. You didn't buy a ticket? I'll win next time. Damn it, I can do it! I'll win next time. Eat your food. Eat your damned food! Okay. Two more servings, please. -Don't eat so much! -Hey. Honey, when does our investment account mature? In two or three months, I think. Why don't you know? You're the one who opened it. Don't we have to make an appointment for dad's surgery? I already did. Don't worry. I'll handle it. What should we do with the rest? Da-na, what do you want? I want a piano! Song-yi brags so much about playing the piano! Will you practice hard if we buy you a piano? Yeah, I'll play every day! What do you think? That's a great idea. But you already have a melodeon. I'll teach you the basics. -Mommy. -What? I want to go to English academy. Joo-hee bragged about attending English academy. I'm proud of you for wanting to learn. Will you study hard? Yes, I'll go every day! -Da-na. -What a good girl. I'll teach you that, too! I can teach you all the basics of English. Let's eat now. Be quiet. I'll teach you everything. Don't worry. You get 250 points. Soo-hee doesn't know yet, does she? Keep it down. When are you going to tell her? Shut up! Move it! That's my bed. You're not going to tell her? You chose logic. If I do, she will divorce me. Dad, what do you call a situation where you're you can't do anything anymore? Helplessness. That's your dad right now. -Helplessness. -That's correct! Wow! Who said he would plant an apple tree even if -the world ended tomorrow? -Spinoza. Spinoza. -Correct! -Da-na, you dad needs to plant a tree for wood to build his coffin. Dad, what's the term for helping someone die? Euthanasia. -Da-na, will you help your dad? -The answer is euthanasia! -You're dead. -Wow! You got first place, Daddy! You won Housewife Quiz Master! You're a homemaker. You could win if you go on the show. Congratulations! You win 30 million won! -In addition, -That's it! you also win a free vacation. It's 30 million won! Preliminary contestants, this way, please. Hurry up! Are you kidding? No, I can't do this. Where else will you get 30 million won in a month? I'll find a way somehow. -Jin-man. -Let go! -Are you crazy? -It's only three weeks. -No. -Excuse me! Are you here for the exam? Yes. Good luck, honey! Thank you for your patience. I'll reveal the preliminary results. Myung-soon Kim. Ae-ja Han. Here! Geum-shin Lee. Here! Young-shil Oh. Here. Finally, this person scored highest on the preliminary exam. Jin-man Jo! Is Jin-man Jo here? I'm sorry it ended up like this. Let's work together again if we have another opportunity. Soo-hee, all your hard work was wasted. I'm sorry. Sung-hye, we'll have to postpone the kids' field trip to the station. My show got canceled. Because of low ratings. It can't be helped. It makes me upset and sad. If someone gave me another chance, I would sell my soul. What are you doing? Let's go eat. Okay. I can't believe you came in first place. Young-seung, get me a bigger size next time. I have a wedgie. -Is it uncomfortable? All right. -Yeah. I have to thank the makeup artist. My legs ache. -Oh, no! -Young-seung. Hello, Soo-hee. Did you have a shoot today? Yes, this is Geum-ja Chun. She's on a weekend drama. See you later, Soo-hee. Bye. She didn't recognize you. Yes? Who is this? I called you away from prying eyes at the office. What's this about? I'm looking for a new host for my show. We should get to know each other if we're going to work together. Don't tell anyone for the time being. Let's discuss the show. Me? Nothing's official yet. We'll see how it goes. All right. Keep it a secret. The current host can't find out. There's a lot of gossip around here. Nam-kyu. Yes? Why did you choose me? I like ambitious women. Let's make it work. What the hell? Hey. You have terrible taste, pervert! Let go! He grabbed my ass! -What? Bastard! -Help! Take that! Come here. Bastard! -Come here! -Let go! Punk! You're doing great, Young-seung! This is unacceptable. Even though he passed the preliminaries, he should be disqualified. Imagine what would happen if he was on the show. Everyone will say he's in it for the prize money. The internet will go crazy. Look. Our show is for homemakers regardless of gender. Jin-man! Yes? Are you really a homemaker? -Yes. -He's a homemaker. He almost had a baby. We would be deceiving viewers if he appeared on the show. What are you talking about? John Lennon stayed home after his son was born. James Rubin, who served in the US State Department, also quit his job to stay home, so his wife could pursue a career. That's the US. In our country, men... Do you know how many stay-at-home dads are in this country? It's a reflection of the times and will definitely become an issue. Our ratings are down. The show might get canceled. Let's go for it. Can you do well? What? It will help the ratings, right? Okay, is next week okay? Of course, it is. You're free, right? Absolutely. The coming week is important. Cram your head with facts and news. Memorize the newspaper, okay? What do you mean? How can I go on without makeup? How else will you get 30 million won? If Soo-hee finds out, it's over. She's been nagging me to find a job. Jin-man. In my experience, a woman will say yes to anything in bed. Do your best. -Just do it. -Hey. -Then talk about it. -Be quiet. She will say yes to anything afterward. Did something good happen today? My show was canceled. But you worked so hard on it. Oh, well. Where were you today? You've been neglecting your duties lately. You're dead tonight. Honey. Honey. Honey! Hurry up and take your clothes off. Hurry. Goodness, honey! Daddy! Read me a story! Honey. I need to tell you something. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Let's meet the contestants now. Geum-shin Lee from Miari! Bong-chul, Bong-soo, I'll do my best! Let's go! -Go, Mom! -Go, Mom! She has two reliable sons. Next up is Myung-soon Kim from Myeonmokdong! Don't be nervous. Just relax. -All right. -Let's go! Let's go for three consecutive wins! Go! -Let's go! -Go, Ae-ja! Camera two. Cut! Now we will introduce the final homemaker. I've been the host for several years now. This is a historic moment for our show. Introducing the first male contestant, Jin-man Jo from Bundang! -Are you okay, Jin-man? -Yes. I'm okay. -Goodness. -I'm fine. Can you tell us how you feel about being on the show? Okay. Well, I... Goodness, there's a man on Housewife Quiz Master. -Isn't that Jin-man? -Where? Is he bragging about doing housework? His wife probably wanted him to win money. He gives men a bad name. -Gosh. -Well... I hope my appearance will make my family happy. Camera three, cut! Hey, it's a starry night -Jin-man, is that your friend? -Yes. Yes, he's the only devoted buddy who had time to come. Oh, no. He's my friend. He means that they're best friends. Okay, let's begin the quiz! There are eight historic universities known as Ivy League campuses on the east coast of the United States. Ivy is a flowering plant in the grape family, otherwise known as... Geum-shin was the fastest. The answer is? Vitaceae. That's correct. American meteorologist Edward Lorenz first coined this term in 1979. If a butterfly flaps its wings in Beijing, its impact will travel to New York... Ae-ja, the answer is? -The butterfly effect. -Correct! As a trademark life-saving crop, it's known as sweet potato in English... Jin-man, the answer is? The answer is goguma. Goguma? That's incorrect. Let's hear the rest of the question. Where did the sweet potato originate? -Handball. -That's correct! -The answer is? -The answer is lacquer. That's incorrect. The answer is Plato! That's correct. -The answer is rugby. -That's correct. -The answer is green grapes. -Correct. This week's winner will be determined by the final 50-point question. Does anyone want to use their chance? If you get it correct, you will earn 100 points. If you get it wrong, you will lose the same number of points. I'll use my chance. Jin-man who is currently in third place will use his chance. If he gets the answer right, he will earn 100 points for the win. However, if he gets it wrong, Geum-shin will be today's winner. Here's the final question. KOREAN LANGUAGE It's a Korean language question. This phrase was derived from a form of punishment in the Joseon Dynasty. When plans go wrong or proceed unsatisfactorily... Jin-man. You pushed the buzzer without hearing the entire question. Can you get it right? The answer is? I don't know! Your chance is on the line. We'll give you three seconds. Damn it. Damn it? That's correct! This phrase is now used as a curse. However, it referred to flogging as punishment in the Joseon Dynasty. Congratulations, Jin-man. Please step forward! Congratulations! Jin-man was in third place when he successfully used his chance to become the first male winner of the game. Along with 10 million won, you also win a steam cleaner! Congratulations! Can you tell us how you feel? Sure. Good job, everyone! -Good job. -Good job. Nice job. -Good job. -Goodness. What did you think of today's show? It was entertaining. It should get a good response. The news desk wants information on Jin-man Jo. Really? That's great. Give it to them. See? There's already a response. I can't believe the answer was "Damn it." Ji-man, did you know that was the answer? -That's hilarious. -Hello? Yes, I'm Jin-man Jo. Goodness. TV station? Hello? This is Jin-man Jo's manager. -Hey! -Hold on. He's been a homemaker for six years. -Ever since he got married. -Hey! -You can call me. -Hey! Thank you! -Damn it! -Jin-man. They want you to appear on a morning talk show. What talk show? No way. I'm not going on a talk show! It's really tough getting on a talk show! Bye teacher. Bye, guys. -Bye! -Bye! Bye! Hello. I'm Da-na's manager from now on. Daddy! Be careful not to fall. Hello, Young-seung. Right. -Daddy, -Yes? did you go to the market today? Come here. I went on the quiz show and won! -Really? -Yeah. You're awesome, Daddy! Are you happy I was on TV? Yeah, you're the best. Does Mommy know? Mommy? Da-na, let's wait and tell her later. Much later. How about people around us who are unique or set good examples? Viewers will be able to relate and empathize. No corny celebrities though. Viewers enjoy corny stories. Everyday people might be more enjoyable. Like the man who appeared on Housewife Quiz Master? What? I suppose so. Soo-hee, viewers escape reality by watching TV. Their lives are hard enough. Why would they want to see more of that on TV? Right. What does your husband do for a living? What? He owns a business. He must be happy his wife is pretty and driven. Yes. Do you have any other ideas? I'm not much help to you. Try harder. Right. Let's get some air. Daddy's mad. I'm going to spank you. What's this? Say hello. Your mom never puts things away. That's Mommy's ring. That's her wedding ring. -Wedding ring? -Yeah. When we got married, we put these on our ring fingers. We promised to love each other. Why that finger? Da-na, make a fist like this. Thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky. The ring finger is hard to raise by itself, right? -Yes. -People are the same way. We can't live alone. When you fall in love with someone, you wear a ring on this finger. You make a promise to love one another forever. Did you and Mommy promise? Of course, we did. That's why we have you. But your Mommy must be running late again. Thank you. I really like your voice. It's warm. I'll call you. Let's exchange ideas by email. There's a high probability of increase. Land development... Use a separate towel for wiping your feet. Okay. Honey, help me with these anchovies. Just leave them. Come on, help me out. I had a tiring day. Why would you be tired? I did all the housework. I played with Da-na, too. That's your job. Where's the remote? Honey, how can you say that? -What's with you all of a sudden? -What do you mean? Do you think I'm a joke because I'm home all day? Of course not. No one's forcing you. You chose to stay home. That's right. I just love housework. -I love it to death! -A male contestant -Why do you say it like that? -won the quiz show for homemakers. Hyuk-jae has more on the story. A male homemaker named Jin-man Jo, won Housewife Quiz Master, a quiz show designed for housewives. The answer is Plato! He got a job with a major company after graduating from a top college. But he chose to become a stay-at-home dad six years ago. Don't. That wasn't you, right? Have you gone insane? I thought it through. That's why you ended up on the show? What if people we know watch? I needed the money. Don't worry about money. I'll get a new show. We also have the money for Dad's surgery. We can use that in a pinch. You went on the show for money? No, it's not that. I told you to get a job! I'm a public figure. Didn't you think of me at all? Honey, I... I'm sorry. I won't go next week. Damn it! The first male quiz master. It's over after seven days? Remember back in high school when that crazy teacher beat those kids for not paying their student council dues? You said, "A real teacher wouldn't hit kids like that." Why are you bringing that up? You were just as cool on the show as you were back then. You're the first male homemaker to come out. All behavior is driven by ideology. Standing up to that teacher was your ideology. Appearing on the show is your ideology, too. Ideology or not, it might cost me my family. I saw you on the show I hope you win again next week. That's my good girl! It made me so happy to see my son winning on TV. Right, Grandma? Isn't Daddy the best? Did you like it too, Da-na? That's my baby. Grandma, are Daddy and I both your babies? Of course. You're both my babies! Mom, don't tell Dad. Worry about yourself. Go change. Your father will be home soon. Okay, I will. Hello? Yes. When? Okay. Right. You worked hard today, honey. My dad collapsed. That was what the phone call was about? We should've left earlier. My sister is there. I need to go to the hospital after I drop you off. We're home. When we play Go-Stop, -he always wins! -Goodness. He's also the neighborhood representative. -He does so many good deeds. -My son had a stomachache. Jin-man healed him with acupuncture. He cooks very well. -That's right. -He made all the food -for a birthday party. -There he is! Jin-man! -Jin-man! -Jin-man! -There he is! -Where? -He's here! -Over here! -Jin-man! -Excuse me! Jin-man! -Look over here! -Give us a statement! Be quiet. You'll wake my daughter up. How do you feel about winning? When did you become a homemaker? Can we interview your wife? What? -Don't be like that. -Please! Say something. HANIL HOSPITAL What about the surgery? The sooner the better. Bring me the money for Dad's surgery tomorrow. Honey, to tell you the truth, the money for the surgery... I invested it in a gye to earn more interest. But I lost it when the gye fell apart. That's why I went on the quiz show. If you win three consecutive weeks... Are you out of your mind? Are you nuts? If you can't contribute, don't screw things up at least. How can you say I don't contribute? -Why don't you give me some credit? -Credit? I put up with being called a has-been at work for you. It's tough for me, too. I cook, clean, and do laundry. I haven't had a day off all year. I get really depressed at times. But I put up with it and kept going. Because someone has to do it! So, you want to earn money by announcing that you're a homemaker? You should be ashamed of yourself! Why should I be ashamed? I'm not ashamed one bit! I'll proudly tell the world that I'm a homemaker... Is something wrong? No. Are you busy? What? Do you play? No. Then I'll teach you. Catch! Use your left hand to aim. Snap it lightly with your right hand. Lower it to the right. Look at the rim. It's the only thing that exists in the world. You only have one shot. Think of it as the only shot you will have in life. Throw it! Did you see that? Did you see it? How did I do that? Let's have meetings at the office from now on. What? -What if people... -You're the new host. I've decided. Really? I'm the host of your show? You worked really hard amid tough competition. Thank you. I'll definitely repay you for this. How? What? I'll work hard. That won't be enough. Just working hard won't do it. With one second left in a tied game, you're shooting a free throw. -Hello. -The key to room 502, please. Sure. Yes, Nam-kyu? I think you have one of my files. Can you come out for a second? Well, I'm in the shower right now. Really? Then ask your husband to come out. We're showering together. Okay then. I'm envious. Who is it? It's the front desk. "What a nice house. Can I come in?" "No, you can't! You want to eat me!" "I'm going to get you!" She's asleep. Da-na, what should I do? I won't be able to keep my promise to you tomorrow. Do you miss Mommy's smile, too? Just do this. Jin-man still isn't here yet? He's not even answering his phone. What time is it? Does he know the show is today? Just a moment. Of course, he knows. Why can't you get in touch with him? I'm sorry. How should I know why he isn't coming, asshole! I'm sorry. I lost the money. Excuse me. Who are you? I'm his son-in-law. You were on Housewife Quiz Master. He brags about you so much. He asked me to wake him up before the show today. He made a bet with friends that you would win. He said he would feel better about the surgery if you win. Shouldn't you be at the TV station? HOUSEWIFE QUIZ MASTER Hello, it's Bum-soo Son from Housewife Quiz Master. We have five contestants -on today's show. -No, only his manager is here. He hasn't arrived yet? Hurry up and find him! Taxi! Seagull's dream? That's correct. Ji-hye is currently in the lead. Has Jin-man arrived? We're still trying to contact him. This is killing me. Here you go. Thank you. Congratulations, Ji-hye. You're headed for the final round. Today's highlight is coming up. We'll begin the final round with last week's winner, Jin-man Jo! Jin-man isn't here yet! Buy some time! Let's start by interviewing Ji-hye Kim. What are you doing as his manager? Give me a second. I'm just a friend of his. You never signed a contract with me, son of a bitch! I would like to thank my hair stylist for encouraging me to try out. My dog, Poppi, is watching at home. -Poppi, I love you! Cheer me on! -What's going on? -From now on the sauna... -Put the runner-up in the final round. Go straight! I have some bad news. Due to a personal matter, last week's winner, Jin-man Jo, won't be able to appear today. I was looking forward to his appearance since he was the first male contestant to appear on the show. Just a moment! -Hello, Bum-soo. -Hello. Just keep going! It's Jin-man Jo! -There he is! -Hurrah! It's Da-na's Daddy! He's so handsome. He's a regular here. He's much more handsome in person. I shook his hand. There he is again. He's better than us. Checkmate! We will start with true or false questions. Please listen to the statement carefully before answering. Let's begin! Bacchus is the Roman god of wine. Drinking tea with medicine is unhealthy. An ant will die if it falls off the 63 Building. Yawning is contagious. An owl can turn its head 360 degrees. Spaghetti originated in China. On earth... Why did you throw the dog at me? I thought you wanted him. Why haven't you left yet? I don't feel well. Why did you turn the TV off? Give me the remote. Hold on, I was watching something. Just hold on. The corresponding points... The winner will be determined by the final question about food. What is the question? This question is about kimchi. There are many types of shrimp jeotgal. What is the kind most commonly used to make kimchi? Jin-man, if you get this question right, you'll win two weeks in a row. What is your answer? The answer is yukjeot. Kimchi made with yukjeot is the best. That's correct! Congratulations on your second consecutive win! Thank you! Thank you! I'm his manager! Jin-man wins after answering the question correctly! -He won! -Good job! -Please step forward! -Do we have medicine? I still feel sick. Why are you crying? This show is so sad. Why were you clapping? I always clap when I'm sad. Goodness. Goodness. Ji-hye, you came close at the end. I had fun playing against Jin-man. I hope you win again next week. Thank you. Good job. -Jin-man. Next week is a family special. -Yes? How do you feel about attempting your third and final win? As a man, I was really conflicted -about appearing on the show. -Right. However, I wanted to be forthright. For other male homemakers like myself, I'll become the quiz master. -All right. I hope you go on... -Bum-soo. -I'm sorry. -What is it? One more thing. Da-na, it's Daddy. I love you! SPECIAL REPORT ON MR. HOUSEWIFE QUIZ MASTER Jin-man Jo Wins Twice Mr. Housewife Quiz Master Jin-man Jo's Lifestyle I was really drunk the other day. I'm sorry. We have a new policy that pays up to 50 million won if you get breast cancer. It's an additional 30 million won for uterine cancer. HOUSEWIFE LIFE You couldn't have won without my help. I'll make a study guide for you. You have to study harder. Fly higher! You're doing great, Jin-man! He's an up-and-coming star, but he's not a celebrity. Please introduce yourself. I'm Mr. Housewife, Jin-man Jo. Even your name is exciting! What if Dad finds out? The elders think you're a disgrace to the family. Leave me out of it. Bye. What's wrong? Soo-hee hasn't called in a week. I heard she got a new show. Family picnic with daddy The first show has to make a big impact. Why don't we invite Da-hye Oh? She's a popular singer. Book her. Anyone else? Everyone's talking about Mr. Housewife. What about him? Mr. Housewife? His name is Jin-man Jo. He was on Housewife Quiz Master. He's really hot lately. I'll look into it. Everyone wants to book him. Okay, book them both. Soo-hee. Soo-hee! Yes? This is a meeting about our first show. I'm sorry. I don't want an apology. You're in charge of booking Jin-man Jo. Don't expect a free ride. Do you understand? Yes. How's the set coming along? Things get done when Nam-kyu is in charge. How did Soo-hee Lee become the host? Who knows? I was shocked Nam-kyu chose her over the competition. -Did you see her looking stupid earlier? -That's right. If you're old with no ideas, -at least have some sense. -I know. Maybe she's good at seducing men. What do you mean? Look at her eyes. She has probably seduced dozens of men. What about my eyes? No way. Hello? It's me. You want me to appear on your show? Just act like you don't know me. You need Mr. Housewife, but not as your husband? Don't talk like that. I'm having a tough time. Acknowledge me. I'll appear then. How? Acknowledge me as a homemaker. Then I'll appear. What's with you? Do you want to ruin everything? Honey, don't do this. Let's go home. Sorry, I need more time. Gosh. If it's true, there will be tremendous backlash. This is Mi-na Choi with MBA News. There's been a large increase in the number of male homemakers trying out for Housewife Quiz Master. Jae-young Jung has the details. There were more than ten men who tried out for the quiz show today. We studied for the bar exam for six years. My wife passed first, so I took on a supportive role. This phenomenon was caused by a man who... I'm glad he's not my son. However, I wanted to be forthright. For other male homemakers like myself, I'll become the quiz master. What? Dad. What brings you here? Why are you home instead of work? They gave us the day off. Have you eaten, Dad? How to tenderize meat Da-na is Daddy's treasure. How's work? The economy is terrible lately. It's so-so. Why did you buy us a kimchi refrigerator? Your mom was happy though. I got it as a bonus at work. Are things going well with Soo-hee? Of course. Why wouldn't they be? Go ahead and eat, Dad. That's a relief. Did you put MSG in the soup? No, I added ground perilla seeds. I noticed that you like it. You know my taste better than your mom even though we've been married for 40 years. If you're going to do it, do it right. Whatever you do. Once you start, follow through. Thank you for coming. You're even prettier up close. Braces are okay. They're fine while kissing. Hello. -Did you enjoy your stay? -Soo-hee! What are you doing? -Jin-man. -Yes? Are you and So-hee still on bad terms? Can't you tell? Makeup with her quickly. -Otherwise... -Rehearsal is starting. Okay. Go rehearse. -Hello. -Hello. DELICIOUS STORY You look great. We're wearing microphones. Please, shut up. Standby! Camera two, zoom in! Cue! There's a homemaker who has become a sensation lately. He was the first man to win Housewife Quiz Master. That's right. Please welcome Mr. Housewife, Jin-man Jo! -Hello. -Hello. Congratulations on your second win. Thank you. -Yes. -Thank you. Like this. Finish it off with whipped cream. -That's beautiful. -After that, -garnish it with fruit. -Right. Was it tough balancing housework with raising a child? Yes, there were many challenges. At times, you feel boredom. In my case, I became depressed. It's not only women who feel that way? No, it's not. There's nothing harder than being a homemaker. Depression doesn't differentiate between gender. I realized it's a disease that's created by your environment. -I see. -Yes. You're an amazing homemaker and stay-at-home dad. Your wife must be very happy. I'm not sure. What do you think? I'm sure she is. If I met a man like Jin-man, I would marry him immediately. Marry me. What are you saying? Soo-hee, how would you feel if your husband was a homemaker like me? -What? -Would it make you happy? Yes, I think it would. It must be great! Let's move on. -Soo-hee, good job. -Thanks. -Thank you, Jin-man. -Sure. -You did great. -Thank you. Let's go to dinner. Did you see the producer earlier? He put his arm around Soo-hee so casually. It was strange. That's why they say women and dishes break if you're careless with them. Are you saying Soo-hee is broken? She probably just has a chip. Come here. You know something, don't you? Know what? It's written all over your face. Tell me. -Forget it. -Tell me, punk. I'm not kidding. What is it? Gosh. Tell me! Soo-hee, let's have another drink since the show went so well. You seem pretty drunk. Next time... You always say that. What about me? I'm not leaving tonight. Nam-kyu, don't do this. Be honest. You don't like me? Tell me if you don't. See? You can't. Are you kidding... What the hell? Come here! Damn it! Jin-man Jo? Fucking asshole! -What is this? -You bastard. -I'm her husband! -What? -What? -Come here, asshole! -Hey. -Asshole! Get off me! Son of a bitch! -Asshole! -Let go! Bastard! She's my wife! Somebody stop them! Jin-man! Nam-kyu! Stop it! Don't do this! Stop it! Jin-man, are you okay? Move it! Don't be angry, Nam-kyu. It was just a misunderstanding. Is Jin-man really Soo-hee's husband? He is. -Why did you hit me? -What? Why did you hit me? Damn it! How's Da-na? You're worried about Da-na? Don't talk like that. If you feel bad, make Da-na's wish come true. The entire family has to appear next week on the family special. I don't want Da-na to look as if she doesn't have a mother. Sorry, I have a meeting then. Don't let your heart wander. -Daddy. -Yes? Is lying bad? Why? Did you lie? Yeah, I told my friends I don't have a mommy. Let me see. Goodness. Why did you do that? The kids kept teasing me, saying you're my mommy. Is it because of what I said? Is that why Mommy isn't coming home? Of course, not. She went on a business trip. I want to play with Mommy. When is she coming home? -Did you brush your teeth? -Yes. Let me see. That's gross! Give me a kiss. -Happy birthday dear Mommy -Happy birthday dear Mommy I love you, Mommy! I love you, honey! Happy birthday! I love you, honey! I don't match. It's your last appearance. You need to stand out. Here he comes! GOOD LUCK, JIN-MAN! Jin-man, you have to win! Go, Jin-man! You're so cool! Thank you! Stop, this is too much. Go, Jin-man! Good luck! HOUSEWIFE QUIZ MASTER Hello, I'm Bum-soo Son. I'm really nervous today. Will Jin-man Jo be able to win three consecutive weeks? Or will there be a new winner? We will find out soon. CONTESTANT WAITING ROOM The show is starting. The contestants need to go. -All right. -Hurry. Like we said last week, it's the family special.
