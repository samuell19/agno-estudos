Let's go! - Let's go! > No food in my stomach > no money to spend > but the wind's in my face > and I'm a free man again About a mile down the road there, there's this little town called Mason. Mason, Alabama; It's in norcross county. I'd say the population's about 2,790. Same today as it was yesterday. Same yesterday as it was a year ago and the year before that. I never told you this before but that's where I spent 17, almost 18 years of my life. I hated it. Slopping through the back doors and going to revival? Man, that place is something else. You just say "damn" down there and they slap you on your ass! That town bugs me, man! Hey man, you from an Alabama town? Small hick town, southern fried chicken and overalls and everything? Hush up! - Hey, people! People! - Hey, hey, hey! You're on sacred ground here! This is J.C.'S hometown. He was born and raised. Oh, it's got pickup trucks, gun racks, overalls. Hey, cut it out! - Gotta order grits- - before they let you in this place! Shut up, hunter, man! Shut up! What do you mean, man? You're ashamed your town or is that a shame to you? Come on, man. I mean it, man. Goddamn it! I said shut up! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Man, I got that place buried down in my guts! Man, I lived it, not you! Look, this may be hick town to you. All of ya, but I had to chew it up and stomach it for 18 goddamn years, man, before I got the hell out! Just cool it, all right? It's your goddamn hometown. As long as you split, all right? We're friends. I love you. Just, no more. - You remember that, hunter? - You remember that, man? It's been 10 years since I've been to this place. Man, I got a gut full of this place. Man, I said I was never coming back here but I got a sister down there and we're going to go in and see her. They're going to know jc masters is back, man. I'm going in and see her and I want them to know we came in peace but when we get ready to leave, I want them to know jc maters had been there, man. I want them to know we came. It's okay, baby. We gonna go in and they're going to know I'm here, man. J.C.masters is back home, man. They gonna know it. I'm with ya, baby! I'm with ya! - They gonna know it. - Hunter, you hear me, man? We'll go back. We'll go in and they're gonna know. - They're gonna know. - That my man has returned. They're gonna know it, man! They're gonna know I'm back. > Ridin' down, ridin' down > hey, lock up your women > hide you beer, yeah > on Thursday we're on up to hell > on up to hell > well, free will and mothers > that way don't give a damn > and we'll follow big poppa onto his hometown > his hometown - No wonder your mouth hurts! - You got a bad tooth, darling. I don't wanna go to the dentist, ma! Well, I know you don't but you got to. Why can't daddy fix it? Darling, if daddy was to have the mind to, he wouldn't take the time. Well, I don't want to go to the dentist. Sit down here. Let me tell you something. Did you know that anything that makes you a lot better, real fast, hurts. Nope. Yeah. Is that true, ma? It's true. Ben, Ben! You gotta see what I came here to tell you. Bunch of motor-motorcycles and guys with beards and pretty girls on back. Y'all come to see it. Charles, you know better than that! There's no motorcycle gang coming through Mason! I don't know, but they're here, Ms. Wages. Let's go, Ben! Now listen, child! Y'all stay away from those chil, that gang! Do you hear me? Yes, mom! Do you understand me? > I'm movin' on > movin' on to nowhere now > a vision of my life is standing here before me now > in my mind > I feel to them as they feel to me > I wish they all would set me free > do you have a passport > do you have a diploma > do you have a memory or two > Come on like a lie > we will be our destiny > we don't care or try to understand > the way for man to be man > it's just a thing to talk about > just a thing I'll never see > do you have your passport > do you have a diploma > do you have a memory or two Cut it out! Cut it out! Okay, shut them down. Hey, you leaving Mr. Nabors? Hey, Mr. Nabors. I wouldn't want you to leave without meeting some of my putt ridin' friends here. We just rode in to see ya! Hey folks, this is Mr. Dj. Nabors! He's the leading dealer in pork and beans here in north Alabama! He's out of sight, man! Hey, Mr. Nabors! Can you tell me where Carlton wages and his wife live these days? You know Carlton wages, don't ya? Don't reckon I know you, young feller! No! Not unless... Wait a minute! You J.C. Masters? Yes, that's who you'd be, asking for Carlton wages! Carlton married your sister, didn't he? How about that, Mr. Clean! He remembers! Yeah, old man like that can remember, man. Hey mister, where's the bathroom? Oh, they might have a outhouse around here. I don't know. Tell you, Mr. Apron string, where's all the old town rah-rah. The spirit, you know? Brass band, key to the city house of ill repute? Yeah, man. What kind of jungle are you apes swinging in around here? You leave him alone! Me Jane, you Tarzan! Jane swing with Tarzan, woo! Now, you wait one minute. All of you! Hey, cool it, Mr. Nabors, man! Cool it! These are friends of mine! They're all friends of mine! We ride together! They're a beautiful people, man! Yeah, man! The only difference between us is you have chicken dinner on Sunday and we eat sardines, big man! See this machine. This is my hog! Something you slop, baby! And I love it! Suey! - My machine! Suey, suey! Damn you, J.C. Masters! Everybody know'd you'd go to hell when you left town the way you did! And you have gone to hell! Every damn one of you ought to be thrown in jail! Riding in here, like your own the place! Even got niggers with ya! You damn fool! You can get killed over that! I beg your pardon, Mr. Nabors, but haven't you ever heard of the civil rights here in Alabama? Neffie, come here! This isn't a nigger! This is a black woman! And you'll find the definition very clear in "Webster's unabridged dictionary", pronounced negro, member of black afro race, black pigmentation of the skin, very fine black kinky hair, and her man is a black man! They aren't niggers! Yeah, man. The only difference between you and them, they don't have to get a suntan. Big man! Tell you what? We're playing a little game. We're playing follow the leader. We're falling my big daddy, J.C. Masters! Yeah, all we want to know is where his sister is. If you'll tell us that, we'll bug this place. The old carswell place. Where? Speak up, old man! Talk a little louder! The old carswell place. - Goddamn beautiful! - Now we can get outta here. - Thank you, Mr. Nabors! - You're a scholar and a gentleman! All right, let's go, guys. Start 'em up. Yeah! - Mom, mom, mom! - Motorcycles coming down here! Who? Uncle J.C. And the motorcycles riders. He is not! It's true! Mr. Nabors, down at the store and a bunch of men, they said it was uncle J.C.! With the motorcycles? Yes, ma'am! That is not true! You what... it is! He hasn't been here in ages and don't you dare say that in front of your daddy! It is! They're coming down the road! Really, they're coming down the road! Miriam? Red rover, red rover, send Miriam right over! J.C.! Oh, my gracious! You look so different! Yeah. I guess I look a little grubby, but it's me. Oh my goodness! Hey, you think your old man would mind if I give you another hug? Who cares! Oh, my own little sister! And you're home. > Love ain't dead > love ain't dyin' > love just needs a little tryin' Why don't you get cute on your own damn time? Okay, cool it! These are my friends, sis. Group of beautiful people I met in big a and all around. I guess y'all don't know 'em. Let's see. All right, the one over there riding with me is Kim, Ms. Cool. Back in the back with a guitar, that's dick, "the disciple". Up this way it's little David right there. That's little neffie with him. Right there, see that man with the bald head? That's Mr. Clean! Girl ridin' with him name is Mary, but we call her my bird. And over here, there's Harriet "the hare" we call her that for a couple of reasons. And there's beaver bud with her. He's a handsome mother! Behind him is happy Von wheelie. And there's Beverly bell-bottoms. We call her Panama red. And the man sleeping on his bike back there, that's, uh, that's the hunter and girl with him is Shirley "the Saint". And I don't know who those two boys there are. Well that's my son, Ben and his little friend, Charles. Well, I guess these names sound a little strange to you, made up names. But I remember when we were young, we had some made up names. What was it we used to call you? Uh, dawn star? Dawn star! That's right. First star that dawns. Yeah. - That was silly. - No, no, it's not silly. - Hey, look us. Man, we're not children, but we still got made up names. Just because it's a little different and we dig it, that's all. What do they call you, J.C.? That's big poppa, ma'am. That's J.C., "big poppa" from alabam-bam. They're jokes. Don't worry about it. Nothing to worry about. J.C.? - Huh? You all gonna stay very long? I don't know if we're going to stay at all. That's what I was going to talk to you about. Ugly bunch of people out there, innit? You really changed. Yeah. Well, you haven't changed too much. Well, I have. Mason hasn't change though. Mason won't ever change. - And I just- - you know that. What I really want to know is it okay if my people and I, you know, just kinda stop and sack out under your garage, maybe, for one day or something? Sure. Of course you can. The girls can stay in the, in the, in the parlor and part in the bedroom and, well, you could even, what? Miriam, these are grown people and bikers! Bickers that ride together, sleep together, you know? Okay, well that's fine, J.C. Okay, I mean, you know. I don't want to offend anybody. I'm not, that's not what I'm worried about. I'm worried about you. You and Carlton never got along at all! We ain't worried about Carlton. I mean, you know, I just don't want my sister to throw me out, you know? I wouldn't throw you out, J.C.! Daddy left you enough to enough money to buy this place, didn't he? Sure, I just was worried about you 'cause you got that colored boy and everything. Well. Carlton's hard to get along with. He's a mess. Well, we ain't worried about Carlton. If, you know, if you don't mind us stayin' then we'll, we'll stay. That's fine. Is it? Okay, we'll handle Carlton, okay? Yeah. If Carlton don't like what we do, then he can go down to his service station and he can curl up with a tire or something. All right. All right. - Fine. Okay, settled. Something still just a little bit scary about a man. - Yeah, J.C. Masters. - Yeah, I remember him. He was a good athlete! He was a quiet sort of fellow! And he always seemed to be disturbed about something. In army we'd have called him a psychopath or something like that. Ooh, I can't believe he's coming to this though. Mm-mm, I suppose, the way old man died had something to do with it. Anyway, he oughta have his damned head examined for bringing in a motorcycle gang like this. I knew a lot about them kind. Read a lot about them. I knew some guys in Vietnam who claimed they rode with them in California. Didn't believe them one week to hell, but they were devils. Now, I wouldn't trust any of them behind you with a gun. It's that nigger boy that's a bothering me! Guess you know what a hot head on Carlton is? Why he's liable to blow that boy's damn fool head off with that old 12-Gauge of his. I guess maybe we ought to ride on him out there and warn that bunch to stay out of trouble and out of town. Maybe we can encourage him to ride light out of there before they get settled. Case you know, we'd have every goddamn paper in the country on our necks if we had to run them out of town or throw them in jail. Freakin' papers! Guy can't do nothing decent no more without having them on your neck! Well, knowin' J.C., even played on the same team with him, I guess I oughta handle it, huh? Seems like I remember the two of you tangling asses when you was in high school. Well? If I remember right, why he kicked the living shit outta of you and you was a couple of years older than he was. Well, that was a long time ago. I've learned a little bit since then. Yeah, you fight the cong and you learn. Yeah, I know. I know all about you being a big karate expert, but I know that boy, too, and his daddy before him. No, I think maybe I better ride on out there with ya. If there's any trouble, why it'd be better if we was both along. Want shotguns? Hell no, we don't want no shotguns! Boy, we'd just be asking for trouble! You know you're going to be the sheriff around here someday and there's one thing that you got to learn. You can't insult a man by taking an advantage of him like that if you're going to reason with him. Now you got to learn that. Yes, sir. > I'll be satisfied as long > as my love keeps me close > close to thee I remember you. You was singer in the family. Yeah. Hi, babe. Miriam, you've been asking about the people I run around with, here's one. This is Kim. The one I call Ms. Cool. How do you do? She's a, she thinks she oughta mother me, you know? Thinks I can't get along without her, but she's all right. Well, I'm glad to see somebody's watching over him. Well, he's not telling you the truth, you know? He loves his motor more than he does me, but I love him anyway. Yeah. You don't know who you love, you know that? Let me tell you about her. Say she's a social worker, right? So, you went to school, got her masters. Yeah. And then she saw so much shit in the world that she couldn't take it and it blew her mind, so now, she thinks I'm one of her orphans and she's got to look after me and she tries to mother me like I said. He didn't tell you that we were living together, did he? He didn't tell you that, did he? No, I couldn't very well sleep with him if I mothered him, could I? Well, I'm no judge, J.C. You live your life your way and I live my life mine. That's, I can dig it! That suits me fine. How about you? Mm-hm. There they come. Who's that? Get 'em, dog! That your dog? One of your friends? I mean, she used to be your friends, too, J.C. Yeah, it's been a long time, Miriam. Hey, Grady! Good evening, Miriam. Danny. - Hey, little J.C. How you doing, sheriff? Dan. Good to see ya, J.C. Yeah. How you doin', Miriam? What's the matter, sheriff? My friend's making too much noise? Bothering you a little bit or something? Just thought she could explain what's going on here. That's all. Ain't nothing going on. I just came to visit my sister, brought a few people with me. Why? What the hell they doing anyhow? Hey, hold J.C., old guy. Nobody's accusing you of doing anything. We're just curious. You know this town as well as we do. People still wonder about the county fair around here. Never had a motorcycle gang in here before and that's bound to make people wonder. They can stop their wondering, man. Now, wait a minute, J.C.! Just cause you're wearing them motorcycle boots and sportin' that long hair and a beard that don't make you the top beast around here. Man, that's funny. "Top beast". Hey, instead of being big poppa, I can be the top beast. You like that? Forget it! But there's one thing it ain't so easy to forgive. You bring in that colored boy into town here. Good god, man! Don't you know what could happen? Mr. Sheriff and Mr. Deputy, that colored boy happens to be a friend of mine. Remember, I always had colored friends? 'Member Willie parks? Used to run around Willie parks. The only difference in Willie parks and little David is Willie's probably driving a mule now and little David's driving motorcycle. You guys tell me how old do you have to be around here before you have to quit associating with colored boys? Hoo-wee! Well, you really went off the deep end, didn't you, J.C.? Knew some guy just like that in Vietnam. I guess maybe you want to stage ya a protest 'fore you leave, huh? Huh? Nope, officer friendly, but I bet you'd love a love-in. Dan, why don't you quit passing out that high school hero bullshit? If we're going to protest about anything, it'll be that kind of stuff. Man, you're even more ignorant than you used to be. Cut it out! You, too! Let him, let him go, Grady! Watch who you're calling ignorant! Let him go, Grady, man. What? You think you're so much better than everybody else? Huh? You. Got on a uniform now. You still a fighter? Get in the car. Wanna find out? Yeah. Martin! Now, as for you smart ass. He started it! I want you to know one thing! I ain't gonna figure on having any trouble around here. You understand that? All right, I ain't looking for any trouble but can he push me just cause he's got a uniform on? Look, we didn't come in here looking for any trouble. I came to visit my sister, like I said. And I didn't mean to cause anything. I guess just seeing him in that uniform pisses me off. You know that? How we used to be. And I ain't going to cause any trouble here, but we ain't gonna take any crap either. If the townspeople don't like us and they start bugging us, we ain't gonna run, okay? All right. You just remember what I told you? Yeah, okay. > We're standing here on the day of death > waiting for the hour > we're standing here on the day of death > lookin' for an ivory tower > oh, come fair death and > take our hand and > lead us to the promised land Freeze it, baby. Freeze it. Freeze it, man. Just freeze it. Why don't you just take that pipe and bust up... You son of a bitch! Ain't no nigger ever talked that way around here and lived! You got about 20 seconds to get on that bike and crank up and get outta here or I'll bust your ears with this little persuader! - You white mother! - Damn you to hell, I mean it! Come on! Come on, come on! Black bastard, I'll kill you! Come on! - I'll kill you yet! You and what army, mother? - Let's go, men! - Brother needs help down here! Gotta get the redneck out, man. Hey, what's going on? It's all right, little David! What's happening? I come down here to take a pee and here this bird is after me with that lead pipe. Cool it, man. Just cool it. All of you get the hell off of my property! He's a pussy. He won't hurt us. I'll have all your asses thrown in jail for trespassing! Trespassing, man? If I remember right, I think my sister bought this place. Look, Carlton, all we're doing is resting. Is that any way to greet your kin? Man, we just going to take us a little break and then we're going to go on Mr. Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law? You ain't even kin to the human race! God knows what blood runs in your veins! It ain't enough that you've already disgraced your sister! The whole town is talking about it! God, I just don't know! They come down to the station and tell me a bunch of bums out here hivin' around my house and you're the leader. We're here, man. And we're going to stay as long as we want to. And if you don't like it, you can go back down to your gas station and pump a little ethnol, man. I'm tired of you. Oh, man. That's guy's a down. You big trouble, David, big trouble. He'd kill us. See, love and peace and this kind of freedom are what god meant for all of us to do. We're the leaders. The whole rest of the world would get on scooters and come out here with us, we'd all be saved. That's what it's right. That's what it's all been about all this time. He or she comes. Cleanliness is next to godliness. What are you doing? I'm gonna way my my bird. What are you doing? What, what are, hey! I can't get 'em! Ah, hell with 'em! Get her clean. Get her clean. That's all right, baby. I'll do it myself! Take if off. - Don't- - whee! Well, Carlton, he's your kin! - Y'all remember J.C. - You heard what he's like. That boy ain't no more like his sister that that old nigger me and I'll tell you one thing else, we let them stay out there one minute longer we all in for trouble! Yeah! - How long he been out there? - Too damn long! - None of 'em worth a damn! You know how J.C. Is! Nobody says anything on account of Miriam, but you know what he's like! We know that he ain't no good. I'll tell you one thing, if he's the leader of that bunch out there, you can just imagine what they are. You come on in! Get in! Hey, I gotta get there next and get the watermelon outta my hair! I'll help you get it out! Harriet! Get in there! You're on my feet! - God loves you! There you are. Thank you. After all those moon pies and big oranges on the road, this lemonade sure does look good. So does a cigarette. I can't smoke when Carlton's around. You don't smoke when he's home? Why not? He got a mean temper! Yeah, I know he's got a mean temper, but you got a mean temper, too. Yeah, well he's got a lot of men at, you know, around him and he's planning on taking everyone of them to run y'all out of here. You know that don't ya? Who, us? Mmhm. He ain't gonna bother us. J.C., you know, y'all been acting different. It's, it's, everybody's seen motorcycles on TV and stuff, but y'all are noisy. It's, you act different. We are different. Are you on dope? Dope? What do you mean dope? Well, I don't know. Well, it's according to what you call dope, man. You mean my people here? Yeah. Well, they're probably smokin' a little grass, drinkin' a little beer. Hell, everybody in the world does that. They're smoking here? They might be drinking lemonade, but I imagine they're smoking a little bit, yeah. Well that's great. That's just terrific. Everybody's getting stoned now I'm getting bussed. Bussed? What do you know about a bus? - Well, that's on TV, too! - You live in the mountains? Oh, wow! You really have changed though. You used to play football and were really active. You don't, you don't do much. What do you do? And why? And why? - Yeah. Well, we ride a lot and we just go where the, where it's happening, listen to music. But every morning when I get up Miriam, there's so much depressing news on the television and the radio, man, I just, it ruins my day. It just, there's so much war and so much killing and so much hate And the old fogies that run this country, what they ought to do, they ought to listen to the young people who want peace and want to be free. It's just so much waste, man. All right, J.C., you're free and you're not doing anything. What do you think of that? Now, I don't know what to do about it. Well, you don't have to do anything about it. We're doing what we want to do and, you know, we don't know all the answers, but at least We aren't causing a lot of trouble. We ride and we go places and we're looking for something. Well, I think a part of it's real good, J.C. I really do. Yeah. And I think part of it is flat out escaping. I don't know which is which. Well, there's nothing wrong with escaping. Maybe that's what we're doing, but you know, we'd dig it. It's our thing. And I, I don't really want to be preached to, you know? I'm not preaching. I'm just kinda, kinda thinking about it. That's all. Well, we'll see. Hmm? I just don't know. Well. I'll stick by you in any case. I know you will. Hell, we ain't, we ain't like other people you've read about anyway. What do you think we're like? I tell you what bothers me. I've been reading. Honest to goodness. Now if you doing what you said that, you say your a pacifist, right? Pacifist, yeah. Yeah, but you know what? Every time you go into a town, there's trouble. Now, I know you don't steal. Do you, J.C.? No. -And- - I don't know what a sex pervert is. I'll let you in on a little secret, little sister. We ain't anything like that. We dress this way 'cause we dig it and 'cause we travel light. Yeah, we're riding 'cause we're looking for something. I don't know what it is, but we're looking. But we ain't anything like those other cats, the ones you read about in the paper. I guess some of us get a little carried away with it. Kim's got this thing for me and Shirley thinks it's a religion. Disciple actually wants to die. That's the reason he's riding. He wants to die and he's looking for a way. But what we're trying to do, we're just, you know, just trying to be free. We don't want to answer to anybody and we really don't bother anybody unless they push us. Then we, we don't run. You still have those bad dreams, jc.? Yeah. You mean those nightmares? Papa used to call them visions. Mm-hmm. Yeah, sometimes I still see that giant winking eye on the ceiling or playing around up in the clouds, telling me what to do and where to go. That may be the reason we're here. You know, sis, talking about that giant winkin' eye, sometime I think maybe I'm a little bit crazy. Just a little bit. You know papa said you were a prophet? Yeah, and pop always said you were going to be damned because you're a woman. Woman created lust and lust is the handiwork of hell. Poppa probably spinning around his grave if he could see us now. See how wrong he really was. J.C., let's don't ridicule the dead. Let's let him be. You're here today. You're gone tomorrow. It's very peaceful. Let's leave poppa in peace, too, okay? Yeah, you're right, sis. I know and you know that I've gone to hell on a hog, my motorcycle. So let's admit it and shut up about it. Hey, do you ever see Rachel? Mmhm. Every once in a while. Is she married? No. No, she's not. She works at the bank. She's a teller. You know somethin', J.C.? I don't think she's going to ever forget you. She's a very, very funny thing. I go in there from time to time and she'll be talking about something else, you know? She'd ask me if I've heard from you. Just like an afterthought. I tell her "no", but I just never ask if she's heard from you. I don't think she'd ever forget you. Rachel, Rachel, Rachel. Oh, pharaoh's army got drownded. Oh Rachel, don't you wait for me. Quit it, J.C.! You know what? Maybe I'll shave this thing off. Maybe I'll shave it all off and I'll go see her and maybe we'll get married and maybe we'll have a dozen kids. Yeah, maybe that's what you should do. Just exactly what you should do. Maybe, maybe lots of things. No maybe about it. Damn, I'm 'bout outta beer. Yeah, baby. I got the last one. Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean. What about a collection, hunter? Get it up yourself, man. I don't want no part of it. Well how about that? How about that? Well, before you go, would you like to hear a song about how all the beer is gone? No, baby. You sing songs, I drive cycles. I think it'd be wonderful. Play me something, baby! Play me. Oh, wow! - Thank goodness! Might even bring me back a playmate. Yeah, make it smoked meat, baby. That's my taste.! Better watch these hick towns now. Whoo, baby, baby, baby! Yeah. Don't see much fruit on what you're doing right now. Yeah, but I'm digging it, you know? Hey J.C., come on down to the party, man. I'm fine, hunter. Thank you. Man. Smoke? Nah, just, just gonna have a little lemonade, man. That's nice and gold, man. We weren't invited up to your patio for tea. You know, I thought I'd come up and see if you want to join the party. You're invited anywhere you wanna be. Well, I'm glad to see some southern hospitality, Mrs. Wages. Would you like to show me some of your southern singles here? First of all, don't call me Mrs. Wages. My name's Miriam. You mind, J.C.? Well, I can show you the scuff nuts. The what? Scuff nuns. Do you smoke 'em? No, I don't smoke. All right, go right ahead. You know, lady, I've been thinking, I decided we'll try some of the southern love y'all have down here. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, if you can ball at grease monkey old man ears, you oughta let me have some. I wouldn't even dream of it! J.C.! J.C.! J.C.! - Goddamn you! - I'm gonna kill you, you mother! Son of a bitch! I'll kill him! All right. - Let me at him, man! Get out of the way! All right. Watch out! - Watch out. Are you okay, Mrs. Myers? I'm fine, Ben. Me and Charlie playin' motorcycles. We didn't mean to scare ya. Ben's mother told him, told him to come over and spend the night with us, with me, miss Myers. Where are you boys going in such a rush? My uncle J.C. And that crazy bunch are gonna spend the night in my yard tonight. J.C.'s the leader of the gang. Wasn't you the lady that, uh, that went to school with my uncle J.C.? Yes, I knew your uncle J.C. He left before I, before I was ever born and I never did to get to see him. Now he's over there with those bunch of hippies. We got to go now! Miriam? You all right? Yes. Look, I, I, I didn't mean anything by it and just got carried away. You're a beautiful girl. That's old southern blonde hair. We're just used to takin' what we want, whatever we want. You understand how that works, huh? You tell me you don't like it, huh? Nothin' wrong with takin', is there? I didn't mean to interfere in that. It's all right. But, you know, when we left Atlanta, I promised Kim I'd take care of you and her, but I wouldn't care if you killed the damn fella myself. Yeah, I know. Well, we don't get along that well but this time I'm not sure I blame it all on him. I know my sister, you know? I hate to say anything about your sister but she is kind of leading him on little bit. If it hadn't been for that, I'd have killed him. You know that? You couldn't have helped. You couldn't have kept me off. I'd have stopped you because I don't want this thing to happen. Yeah, we got enough trouble in this town. I got bad feeling about it anyway, but we're only gonna be here one more day and we're going to split, so it's no sweat. I'll be glad to. Okay, but remember, the next time you interfere, you owe me, dig? All right. I'll let you have one. One more time, nigger boy. Are you the only one out there smoking that junk? Yes, sweetie man. Dammit, boy. You watch who you call sweetie man, around here. Oh, you all mad, ain't ya? Boy, don't you know how many years on the gang you can get for narcotics, boy? No. No, no, you ain't gonna bust me for that. You got to send me to Atlanta federal prison. Well, around here we figure that the gang is a little tougher than the federal camp ground. You are a mean man! How we gonna win a war without you? Black bastard! The blacker the Berry, the sweeter the juice. At least I didn't dodge the draft like you and the rest of you. Medical reasons, daddy, medical reasons. Nigger, you're just plain scum! I got no time for a chickenshit son of a bitch who won't even fight for his country! You take your hands off me, sheriff, 'cause you know I ain't gonna do it now. Ooh! Go ahead! Right there, boy! Right there. Now I'm going to stop you good! That's one. > Lonely is the way we live and die > lonely is the time we spend > lonely is a wait from first to last > waiting for the world to end > oh J.C? Hm? J.C., now you are really in trouble. Carlton just called and he said that that, that n, uh, uh, colored boy that was here that you brought, David, they had put him in jail and they're gonna lynch him! Oh, bullshit, Miriam. They may put him in jail, but they ain't gonna lynch him. They don't even do that here. J.C. You've forgotten! When they say they're going to do something, they'll do it! You're serious? I'm serious. Go get the guys. We just about to make a run. We'll go on down there and get him out. As quick as they get here, we'll go get him. We'll take care of it. You're right. They ain't gonna lynch anybody. We'll blow the hell out of this town. Give me my jacket. All right, let's go then. We're getting ready. Come on, guys! Let's go! Come on! - Hurry! All right. We're about to make a run, guys. I've been waiting for it. We're ready. What's the problem? They got little David. Oh! It's okay, it's okay. We'll get him out. There's no sweat. We're going to go down there. We're going to get our bikes. Where are the rest of the guys? Let me, let me get his things. Okay, wait, all right. - What the planning on doing? - Wait a minute. I'm going to go by myself. How you doin', sheriff? I hear you busted my man. Is it still against the law to be black here in Mason? I've been expecting you to drop in for a visit, J.C. Before you get your self all pushed out of shape, I want you to know that we went and picked up that black playmate of yours on a narcotics charge and there ain't a hell of a lot that you can do about it. All right, that's one point for you. I don't aim to argue that point right now. What'd you do to him? Well, you might say that he picked up a bruise or two resisting arrest. Course, that ain't nothing compared to what some folks in this town's fixing to do to him. I told you J.C.! I told you what might happen, you bringing that colored boy in this town! Goddammit, Grady Caldwell! You know, as well as I do it ain'tjust little David! It's all of us, man, that's buggin' you! The way we dress and the way we think. You think all we do is go around, burning draft cards and protesting? Let me tell you, man, we don't talk about it as much as Mr. Martin here, but we served our time, too. Me, and little David, and the hunter, and Mr. Clean, and we ain't like it. So we're freewheeling now. We like that. We're just free wheelers, that's all. And it gets under your goddam skin that you can't rule us, don't it? Now wait a minute, boy! This here's the law you're talking to! You can't come bustin' in here shoving us around! Why, you'll wind up sharing a cell with that black buddy of yours. I just want to see him, Grady. I just want to go in and talk to him. I brought him some clean clothes. Yeah, we put on clean clothes sometimes. I just want to take these back to him, okay? What you got in there, a file? I got a pair of sandals and a shirt. Let's see! Okay, you see! Well, I reckon that ain't too much to ask. Martin, let him in there. Let him in yonder with that nigger friend of his. He gonna take your place someday? Yeah, and he'll make a good sheriff. If he lives. Hey, David! Hey, man! David? I got some stuff here for you, man! Look here. Got your sandals. Want you to be comfortable in here, man. Got you a shirt. You okay, man? Hey, I've seen you look a lot worse. You know that? I've seen you look a lot worse, man. You, okay? Yeah. They get you pretty good? One, two, three. Hey Dan, why didn't you kill him, Dan? Why did you kill him, man? Like over in Vietnam. He's too tough. Hey, look, I don't want you to worry. I don't want you to talk. Don't sweat nothin', man. I want you to get dressed up in these duds. You going to be dued and we gonna get you out. You know it? Oh, yeah. We'll get you. Okay, man? Stay cool. You stay cool, rest, we'll be back, okay? Hey Dan, you shouldn't have done that, man. You know that? You shouldn't have done that. Now you let me out of here. Let me out of here. I want to go see Caldwell. Watch out for that man, will you? - Let me outta here, man! - You're going to get yours. Yeah, you're going to get yours. Why did you let him do it? You shouldn't have let him do it, man. You shouldn't have let Dan do that to him. I may be wasting my time, but I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll make you a sporting proposition. You let my buddy out, in my custody, and I'll go get the rest of them and we will ride out a hick town and they'll never see J.C. Masters no more. Well, the last part of that little speech sure does sound interesting, but I'll give you one thing, you're right about the first part. You're sure wasting your time. We'll see. We'll see. Yeah, we sure will. You men having a good time? Just fine. - Yeah. You want to help me get my bike, man? Hell no! - We help you get your bike! I'll help you cut your damn hair! How about that, pretty boy? Give him a shave, too, while you're at it! - Damn, good, man... - Aren't you dodger Owens? That's right. - That's what I thought. - Mrs. Owens' idiot son, right? Yep. You don't get it around here. How you like that parkin' job, pretty boy? Pretty good, man. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! Get on back on the other side of that bike! Get away, buddy! We done got one of your boys up in there! Got your pants on there, son! Be careful! Don't hang your teeth! Get the beard in. Got one of you up there already, you know? Yeah, got your other buddy. You better get on and get outta here! All right, you better stay back, man. I got a switchblade knife in my pocket here and I'm gonna use it the first man that bothers me! It's all to here now, darling. Watch it! - That's all right! You're gonna be all right now, aren't ya? Gonna be all right? You bet your sweet ass, I'm going to be all right. Yeah. No, you might not think too good. I don't know whether you ridin' the thing out of here or not. You'll see. - Want him put back in jail- - with his black brother. Will that toy, does that toy crank up? Yeah! Ooh-wee, wouldn't his old man bring down the wrath of hell on him now? Hmm? That would be something to see! Better than a circus. You know, J.C. Ain't gonna let no old man be preaching hell fire and brimstone to him. Oh, he ain't? Yeah. Well, you didn't know him 10, 12 years ago. That may have been the most screwed up kid ever come out of Alabama. You know anything about black magic? Oh, yeah, you mean- - yeah, yeah, I know you know, but you better read up on it 'cause soon as I get outta here, I'm going to put a curse on you, man. Oh, boy, come on. I still got my slapjack and ain't one minute afraid of your big poppa, J.C. Hey, man, I think you've had about all you could stand. Oh, oh boy, don't go and be foolish. Hey, J.C. Ever tell you about his life here in Mason? No. Never told you what J.C. Stood for? No, Mr. Deputy. Ever wonder? - No. Well, nobody around here ever knew for sure either. Down at the courthouse, his birth certificate simply listed J.C. Masters. At least, that's what they said. I never checked on it myself. Although I do recall J.C. Telling me once before it stood for John chambers. Everybody around here always thought his old man meant for it to stand for Jesus Christ. Ain't that a laugh? You full of shit! You know that? You know ain't nobody gonna ever name their kid no Jesus Christ. Now why don't you take this slop and yourself and get outta here? You mean J.C. Never told you his old man was an evangelist? You a funny man, too. No boy, it's true! Yeah! Back in the twenties, J.C. Old man rode in here in a t model Ford. Car gave out gas about eight miles out in the country. Being absolutely broke, he swung off at the running board and he got in that car, shook his fist at the sky. Took it as a sign from the almighty. "This is my sign from jehovah," he said. "On this place, I will build my church." He did, too. Lord, lord, how he did. You couldn't even call it a religion. More like a cult. That old man, he had more visions than Moses. Course now he died about 20 years ago. Back when J.C. Was a little fella. There's still some of his people living around here. What's that going to do with J.C.? Well, it seems like a lot of them people, they thought jc is going to pick up where his old man left off. They planned it that way. Yeah, they just met and prayed and hung together, waiting for J.C. To get old enough and one day J.C. Up and left, but before he got up on his soap box and told them people they're blinder than hell if they thought he's going to stick around and have a visions for them. As one of the smartest kids ever lived around here, quick mind I ever saw. Best athlete we had, too. I mean, he was mean tempered as hell. Anybody mentioned him in the same breath with his old man, he had a fact to contend with. From the looks of things, I guess old J.C. Never did get over that. He's really fucked up, I tell you. All of you all and his old man, all y'all helpin' him at the same time? Wow, wow, wow! Well, if we never gave him a chance, how'd he get to be one of the best? 'Cause he beat you, man. He just plain out beat you. Mm-hm, well, it looks like, in the end, he's one getting beat. Ain't that right, boy? Boy Roy! Boy. You through with that? You eat it. Oh, you'll eat it, boy. Before you get outta here, you'll eat it and a whole lot worse, huh? First plan is to go in peace. Here's my plan. Listen to it. You don't dig it, we'll try something else. I'm going to go around the back. You guys are going to go in the front and you're gonna raise all kinds of hell, you see? And you keep them, get the sheriff out, get the deputy out, get the people out there. I want them to know that you're out there. I'm want you to raise hell! Von wheelie, I want you to do some wheelies. I want you to raise some he!!! Take your clothes off! I don't care what you do, but get them out front! Scoped out about a kilo of fireworks- - fireworks would be great! - In that shed. Man, great! Look, put the fireworks off! Do anything! Just get them out front! I'm going to go around the back and get little David. Look, I gotta go with you. No, you're going to stay here. That's what I'm going to tell you. You're going to stay here. Kim, you're going to stay here. The rest of you guys meet me at that store. You know that nalley store? Yeah. - Yeah. All right, meet me at nalley's store. Where we had the watermelon. Where we had the fight. Yeah, I remember the watermelon. No sweat. Okay, meet me there. You guys stay here, David and I ride back here. We get you. We go meet them and we split. That's good. - You're willing? You're willing to try it? I'm ready. - Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's do it. Let's go. Let's go. You want your helmet? No, keep my helmet. I don't want it. Hey, Martin, you hear anything? Yeah, that sounds like motors. I bet it's that damn, J.C. Coming back with the rest of it. Could mean trouble, lots of it! Maybe you better go get the shotguns. I got a sneakin' suspicion, you're right. That blame fool kid! I should have run him out of town this afternoon. Well, hurry up. Go get it. Dan! Dan, what's happening? Rachel, don't you hear that noise? Now you get outta here 'fore you get hurt! What is it? What's happening? We had to arrest that nigger boy and they're going to take it out on the whole town. And J.C.? He's in trouble, Rachel. I'm sorry about that for you, but he's in trouble. He as much as threatened us. No! Dan, for god's sakes, don't hurt him! You of all people know what's wrong with him! No matter what's happened he has goodness in him! I know he used to have goodness in him, Rachel, but he's changed. He's dead inside. Now, I got to go! Sheriff went down to Carlton station to get some help. That's where all the men went earlier. You stay here. You'll be safe here. There's no telling what's liable to happen out there on the streets.
