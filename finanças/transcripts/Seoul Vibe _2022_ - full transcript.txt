[man chuckling] [Mr. Yoon] Take it out. [Dong-wook grunts] Hmm. Mystery. Looks legit. [Joon-gi] Is it a wanted poster or something? [paper rustling] [gasps] Oh! Oh my god. Hey, Mr. Yoon! Bro... I love you! Ah! No, no, no! Hey! I was just gonna rip up that shit. - You'd really rip this up? - You really like it? It's Dong-wook's dream to compete in that race. [mimics engine roaring, laughs] Hey, you need a lot of money if you want to compete there. It's hard to make this kind of money even in the States, you know that. Anyway, if you wanna come back, you're welcome any time. I'd say you guys are the best drivers in Saudi Arabia. Hey, Mr. Yoon, sir. Um, Dong-wook is the best driver in the world. - Show respect and honor. - Hey. [Joon-gi] Even the Americans can't compete against Dong-wook. [sighs] If you two start driving around the US like that, you're gonna be dead in no time. Be careful, all right? [sighs] I was gonna charge you for repairs and expenses, but changed my mind. I like you guys. Mr. Yoon... May you live a long and happy life. [both grunting] You have something for me? Huh? You sons of bitches. Of course we do. Oh. [laughs] - You do? - Mr. Yoon. Right, uh... [exclaims playfully] - [exclaims playfully] - Get out of here! - You fucking assholes! Go home! - [laughter] - Thank you! - [Joon-gi] Thank you!

[John] Hallelujah! Brother Dong-wook, Brother Joon-gi, welcome back to the fold. Shit. Forget about all those coarse sands. This is a land overflowing with milk and honey called Holes R Us. Welcome to Joseon. Welcome to Hanyang. Why have you returned empty-handed? Your comments, please. [gasps] Ah. Oh! Oh, I forgot. I left them at the airport because some dudes were chasing us. Ah, so you're saying you didn't bring me a present? Motherfucker! We almost died, and you're worried about presents. - Why is he so grumpy? He's hungry? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, I got you. - Hey! What is this? This Jamaican? How can you become even lamer than you already are? - It hurts me to even look at it. - Oh. Brother Dong-wook, you still have sand in your eyes from the desert. Let's get your eyes checked. I think you need glasses. Check it. This shit is fly as fuck! Whatever. Where did you put my babies? I put 'em in the back, asshole, so they're out of the way. [clattering] [Dong-wook] Finally, it looks presentable. Put this back where it belongs. And get rid of all your tacky crap! What's all this? Have you forgotten, huh? Who's been taking care of all of this for you? And you didn't even say thank you... [metal banging] [clanking] What? Is that a customer? Hey. Is that... those guys from... [banging continues] Oh!

Anyway, Dong-wook, you still know how to drive, right? I just wanted to talk, and you keep running away. What's that all about? Oh! Would you look at these? You never could give these up, huh? This is why you shouldn't be soft with ex-convicts. - Hey, hey! That's burning. Careful. - Shit. Meat is expensive. You shouldn't let it burn. You're always talking about the US. Is that why you're eating LA ribs? Excuse me, sir! Who are you? Can you show me a warrant? Everybody always wants to see a warrant. Kids these days, they watch too much TV. - You watch Chief Investigator too? - What's it to you? You've never met a real prosecutor before. AHN PYEONG-WOOK PROSECUTOR These guys met me a couple of times. Here, give me that. No, no. I've never seen him before. - Don't touch that. You'll rip it! - Okay. You came here because we have this stuff? What the hell! Are you kidding me? You caught a lot of interesting things on this camera. It's amazing. I can't believe that you're Korean with the balls that you have on you. [laughs] Yeah. I told you not to film. I know what you did last summer in Saudi Arabia. Hey. [intriguing music playing] [Bok-nam] What are you... Wow. Are you guys insane? What on earth have you been doing? You used to do illegal deals with Americans in Dongducheon, and now you do illegal jobs abroad transporting dangerous goods, violated the Foreign Exchange Control Act. And then you put the money you made in Saudi Arabia into your mother's bank account in the US. Your mother's in my file too. Currency fraud. [scoffs] You came all the way here to arrest me for this? A noble prosecutor like you? You wanna make money abroad? That's fine. But smuggling it into the country? It's illegal. 11 YEARS IN JAIL You wanna fix up a bbangkku? Fine. But it's illegal to customize your vehicle. FIVE YEARS IN JAIL Be a taxi driver? Great! But not paying any taxes, that's illegal. EIGHT YEARS IN JAIL Do you wanna get the ladies? Fine. But it's illegal to break their hearts. 3000 HOURS OF VOLUNTEERING As for you... you were born to the wrong family. Guilt by association. BAD FAMILY? THREE YEARS OF REPENTING What do you think you're doing? Dong-wook, don't mess with me, okay? At this rate, you'll never make it to the US. If I process all this, it's not just an exit ban, I'll also arrest you. Huh? You'll get a longer sentence because you're a repeat offender. A visa? Not even in your wildest dreams. Sorry to say that I'll be sending this money to the national treasury. But why would I decide to come all this way for that? Don't you think doing all this is a waste of your talents? You know what I mean, right? You gonna live like an outlaw forever? It's like moonwalking. - You keep going backwards. - [clatters] Hey. You're a fan of Knight Rider too? That show has this really great quote. "One man can make a difference." [mimics zooming car] So, what? - Who are you and what do you want from us? - Ah. Who am I? I'm the guy that'll get you to the States. All right. Here's the deal. I've got a job for you. When it's done, I'll send you off myself. America. Let me get this straight... You're asking us to become spies for the prosecutor's office? Bingo! Yeah. Park Dong-wook, you're all grown up now, right? You're smarter now. Why don't you take these cuffs off? Then we can talk. All right. Let's take a look at our first target. Kang In-sook, the president of the loan-shark industry. Now, she's the second most powerful person in Korea. Lee Hyeon-gyun, a former Defense Security Command. Now, he is Ms. Kang's sidekick. These two manage the former government's secret fund. They're the worst of the worst. However, recently the drivers working for them have all been arrested. So they'll be picking new mules, yeah? I want you to go in there and get me the information I need to take them down. So you want to use us to arrest Lee and Kang? Incorrect. Okay. They're just the cherry. I want this guy. REPEATED DICTATORSHIP - Oh shit! - Oh fuck! You must be joking. You mean the guy without any hair up here? Oh man. You want to get the dictator who likes to kill people? Doesn't matter. So we're just... gonna be mules, right? [Ahn] That's right. If you want to become their mules... you'll need to pass their secret test. And it won't be easy. The drivers who are going to be there will be the best of the best. The test will be... tomorrow. ENTRANCE TICKET LA BAMBA Tomorrow? But we don't even have a car. Will a taxi work? Say we pass the test, what then? If you pass the test tomorrow, then the Saudi Arabia problem will go away. And if you find evidence like their secret accounts ledger, then I'll erase all your criminal records. A clean slate. And we're just supposed to believe you? You're gonna forgive all our crimes? Would you like it in writing? That's not enough. What? If we pass the test, I want visas for all of us. We have a deal? [inhales deeply] Okay. Deal. Is that all? Oh yeah... And John... You'll be DJing in this plan. I'll give you a separate set of instructions, so be ready. What "instructions"? - Just be quiet, okay? - Okay. Get me some pictures with this too. I want to donate it to the history museum, yeah? I'll leave the car here. It's new, so be careful when driving it. - Your tax money paid for it, okay? - [car starts] [scoffs] What's he talking about? We've never paid taxes. I've been paying taxes recently. [Joon-gi] You pay taxes, but your license isn't legal. [sighs] [Ahn] Just like I thought, mules from all over the world gathered in one place. [clanking] They're all gonna be desperate to get some fame from this job. JUNG-GU INTERIOR MAP Give them this ticket, they'll give you a film container. You need to deliver that. They'll start at Daehan Cinema, and your destination will be Namsan Hotel. You pick the route. - God, you're slow. - [groans] At this rate, you'll be working all night... - [tool clanks] - Get the fuck out. Unless you'd like to help, dumbass! [Ahn] You have ten minutes, but your car might get destroyed before that. We'll get first place, right? - We can do it. - [Bok-nam] Yeah. I could've carried these for you, but they're so heavy. What girl would ever marry you? [Ahn] I don't care what happens to you, just take care of the car. Be prepared to fight. I'm sure that it'll be dangerous as hell out there. Does he ever shut the fuck up? What did you say? [funky music playing] Yes! Ow! Ah, shit! Moon Knight DJ, how is it going? Hey, Dong-wook... I'm no longer a DJ. Then what are you? S-P-Y. I'm a spy. [clicks tongue] LARGE BBANGKKU [man snores] [snoring continues] [Bok-nam exhales softly] [exhales sharply] [soft chuckle] Ms. Kang. [anticipatory music playing] [sighs] He's in the sauna, ma'am. - So what? - You can talk to him when he's done. [tense music playing] [Kang] A sauna first thing in the morning is bad for you. [General Jeon] Don't be ridiculous. [sighs] [General Jeon] Come, get in the bath with me. It took me two hours to do my hair and makeup this morning. [General Jeon] Sweating in the morning helps you clear your mind. You feel clean everywhere. I can't. I'm going to hire new drivers for us. [General Jeon sighs] Fine. Get it done quickly. He's going to start attacking us right after the Olympics. How can he do this to us, especially after we made him President? [General Jeon] That's how it works around here. [laughs] But, if I'm being honest... [grunts] It's really getting on my nerves. This should be considered our payment. You agree, huh? [laughs] Our payment. That's funny. Korea isn't some convenience store. [chuckles] [sighs] Anyway, it might seem like he's soft, but he is very ambitious. He'll try to act like the boss now, so prepare yourself. After the Olympics opening ceremony, you should go somewhere with a great view, - and take a vacation. - [scoffs] Okay, I'm off. A BETTER TOMORROW [theater employee] Don't sell illegal tickets here! [Joon-gi] Wow, what a beauty! And it has an airdam too! GANGWON 3 Just look at all these mods. Oh! A BMW! Look! And there's an M5 too. [Bok-nam] Wow, M5. M5 is good. M5 is okay. An M5 can't beat a Grandeur. - Grandeur's a superior car. - Oh. Hey, Galchi is here too! What does he think he's doing here? [Bok-nam] Wow. This is quite a gathering. Everyone came out. [chuckling] Galchi, I never thought I'd be happy to see you. Thanks to you, we won't come in last. [Joon-gi] Ooh! [chuckles] John made this mix just for our drive today. Check it. I haven't liked his taste in music lately. - [hip-hop intro plays] - [laughs] You know what John is always saying? He says he's the inventor of Korean hip-hop music. - [Bok-nam] Yeah, really. - He's being a dumbshit. Just 'cause he's listened to a lot of music, he's the best? Hey, don't underestimate John. John went to college, so he's got some good ideas. We can't even dream of being like him. [grunting] Joon-gi, do you really need a water tank like that? Just worry about navigating the car. Since the engine is bigger, we need a bigger cooling tank. [Bok-nam] Oh, for real? [thrilling music playing] [clanks] [rattling] [upbeat music playing] RoboCop! Top Gun! Dirty Dancing!

What's the worst that could happen? - [tires screech] - [men] Whoa! [hip-hop music playing] - [car horn honking] - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's up there? It's the cops. Fucking pigs.

So sorry for the inconvenience. We're regulating traffic for the Olympics. - Thanks for your cooperation. - [man groans] [squeaking] Hey, what is she doing? [chuckles] [car zooming] Yeah! She looks so good as a motorcycle cop. [laughs] Shit. [cars honking] [engine rumbles] [tires screeching] [grunts] [hisses, screeches] [tires screeching] What the fuck? - [Joon-gi] Oh! Whoo! - [laughter] - [whooping] - That's right! Eat that shit! - See that? - High five! - [laughing] - Yeah! Me too! - [tires screeching] - [sirens wailing] I'm going upstairs. Make sure you get rid of those pigs. [men] Yes, sir. [tires screeching] [hissing] Where is it? La Bamba! - La Bamba's in the house! - Here, here, here. - [Joon-gi laughing] - [Bok-nam] Yeah. - [sighs] - Have fun watching it, huh? [Bok-nam] Are we going somewhere? Let's go. Come on. Huh? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is this? - [Joon-gi giggles] - Hey, I don't know you. - What the hell are you doing, man? [Bok-nam] Oh, he's really sensitive. - Whoa! - Hi! Hey. What? Not gonna feel me up too? [clanking] [elevator dings] [people cheering] [disco music playing] [cheering] [all laughing] [women whooping] [whooping continues] [Yoon-hee] Come on, you dumbass. She's here? [disco music playing] [record screeches] [slow music plays] [blows air] [sighs] Congratulations. - I heard that you came in first. - Yeah, I guess. Same team? Yes, as you can see. You got good style. You look like a fun bunch. This way. Wow, she's pretty scary. Don't you think? Are you scared? Don't be scared. I've got a black belt. [Bok-nam chuckles] [Kang] Wow, MJ! Huh? I love this album. Michael Jackson's my favorite. Did we do all that shit just to bring a record here? Michael Jackson's a real artist. [Lee sighs] I'm sorry I'm late. [Lee] Hey. Have you ever been in the army? [Bok-nam] Dong-wook and I were bunkmates. - We both served as military drivers, sir. - [Lee] Huh? And you? [scoffs] Director Lee. He's obviously too young to serve. Men in the army are more trustworthy. Now, you'll receive your job assignments from Director Lee. As you can see, he's a bit uptight. You'll be dealing with him. It's fine, ma'am. We're used to it. Let me explain the rules to you. First, do not ever touch the goods. Second, do not tell anybody where the goods came from. And third, you work for us. We are not your friends. You'll be making ten deliveries. And you'll make ten million won per delivery. - Holy shit! - Ten million? Ten million for each? Totaling 100 million. [both gasping] - [Joon-gi cackles] - And if you need anything, feel free to... I don't think that's enough. - What? - Have you gone crazy? We don't even know what we're delivering. One hundred million is not enough. Oh... That's what I think too. - Yeah, that's true. - I agree. Hey. [soft chuckle] I like your style. Once I step on the accelerator, I don't stop until I go all the way. That's good, all the way. [scoffs] [sighs] First five deliveries will remain ten million won each. After that, ten million per person. Forty million per delivery. How's that? That sounds fair. In return, you have to make sure you're worth the money. Okay, then. But you start working for us, there's no turning back. [gasps] Whoa. Okay? Now, go have fun. [Joon-gi breathing nervously] - [chuckles] - [door closes] [Joon-gi laughs] [Yoon-hee] You guys are so disgusting. [Joon-gi] I think we're fucked. [laughs] - I bet that guy's gonna throw a hissy fit... - Hey! ...'cause we fucked up the Sonata. [laughs] Or we can just buy him a new one. No big deal. - How much can we get paid? - [shushes] What? Where do you think you're going? You've got a job to do. Wake the fuck up! Drop down to the ground! What are you... Yes, sir. Down or up? [Dong-wook] Don't. - [grunts] - [Joon-gi gasps] [Bok-nam groans] - [groans] - [Yoon-hee gasps] - What are you doing? He's just a kid! - This is not a game. You really got drunk just because Ms. Kang told you to have some fun? Are you some kind of bully? Watch your mouth if you want to keep your head. [suspenseful music playing] [liquid splashing] - [flames roar] - [Joon-gi gasps] Whoa! Oh no! [breathing shakily] Well, what now? I can't work without my car. Exactly. So you need to get a faster car. Consider that the second test for you all. - [both gasp] - You've had enough fun, get lost. Dismissed! [Ahn] He set the car on fire? Yeah, that's what I said! The camcorder was in there, so it's also gone. Ah, Lee Hyeon-gyun, that crazy military nut. He really is insane. Well, be careful, all of you. Can you get us a new car? [gate clanking] [funky music playing] - [Bok-nam] Oh my god. - Ooh! [Ahn] Pretty amazing, don't you think? These were returned from the treasury. Take a look around. [boys] Wow! [John] Holy moly! - [Bok-nam] Wow! - [Joon-gi cackling] - [laughs] - Look at this! A BMW! [John] Wow! - Wow, it's a Porsche! - [clanks] I didn't know these cars existed in Korea, huh? - This is paradise. - This one. This one. You can't tell me otherwise. I need this car. Come on! I'm the engineer. - I need to pick the car! - All of you, calm down. Get your fill? You'll only be spoiled if you keep looking. Come over here. What? Seriously? What's he talking about? [Bok-nam] What are these pieces of junk here? [Ahn] These are the cars. This is the precious taxpayer's money. You can pick one. Or I can pick one out for you, yeah? [Joon-gi] Huh? [Bok-nam] Why are you doing this? - [sighs] - [door slams] Isn't it your nephew's first birthday party today, sir? Why are you still at work? [Woong-in] Yeah. Don't overwork yourself. You should go home occasionally. Maybe try getting married. Yeah, sure. I'll get to it. Just stop nagging me. Okay? Get to the point, I'm busy. You really think this will work? You're trying to get back the previous government's pocket money. Is that worth losing everything to you? It'll work, sir. [sighs] And if it doesn't, I'll make it work. And it's not "pocket money." It's their secret fund. They're trying to launder the money and run away with it. I should just let them? Well, they can try to launder that money in their washing machine. Their stain will never wash out. You worked hard catching people that are underneath Director Lee. You get anything? They're all from Squad 606. Commando robots sent to North Korea. Starting plan B with the mules will be a lot faster than waiting for them to start talking. An illegal taxi driver and some kids who smuggle goods in Saudi Arabia? [motorbike rumbling] [tires screech] [Woong-in] Look at them. Strays, all of them. [Ahn] That's why they're perfect for the job, sir. They're unknown, not by military, police, or prosecutors. What could be more perfect? Hey. You know the person I work for is the President, right? And you know why he's not doing anything? It's because his opponents are tough. If things go wrong, all the blame will fall on you. I've already started it, sir, might as well go all-in. [chuckles] Pyeong-wook. I don't know what you're thinking... but this is it for me. You're on your own from here on out. It's unofficial. A secret investigation. Understood? You're even worse than Kim Il-sung. - Yes, sir! - [door opens] If you're done picking out your car, go and get ready. [Dong-wook] This car's a piece of junk. What are we supposed to do with this thing? Hey. That's why I brought you here. Figure it out. Okay. We'll give up an imported car, but we want an extra car. [scoffs] You're the only person driving, why do you need three cars? Oh, this guy. We need at least three cars for us... Rule number four. Do not ever question our methods. Rule number four? [scoffs] What are the other three? Anyway, give us one more car. I want the Grandeur. Huh? There's a Grandeur here? [John] I didn't see it, either. [scoffs] It's right over there! No, there's not. - There's no Grandeur available. - Let's go. Why not? You told us to pick one out from here. Well, we don't have a Grandeur available, okay? [rustling] [Bok-nam] Oh! What's that? Isn't that a Grandeur? Hey! [Ahn] That's... [quirky music playing] That's my car. You can't have that. Hey, hey, hey! [mischievous music playing] [sighs] My brand-new car. [sighs deeply] [engine stops] [Dong-wook] Move your smelly feet. - Come on! - [Yoon-hee] My feet aren't smelly! - It smells disgusting. - Gross, man! - Come on, get out! - It doesn't make any sense. - [Yoon-hee] Hurry up! Get out! - Gonna die at this rate. - Dude, get going! - I'm trying! [Joon-gi] Get out of my way! Hello, sir. [Bok-nam] Joon-gi, why's your tailbone so sharp? Are you all going in at once? Why? Do you travel as a pack everywhere? It's so noisy. Yeah. Let's go. We make too much noise. [monks chanting in distance] [Dong-wook clears throat] [monks chanting continues] [beeping] [rattling] Try not to be too surprised. Pssh. Here! [power turns on] - Oh my god. - [gasps] - How much is that? - [Joon-gi gasps] About... five billion won? - Probably a bit more than that. - Five billion won? Not 500 won? I see now. Well, it's not that much, so you should be able to get the job done quickly. What you need to do is to take this money and buy what I tell you to buy. Simple, yes? Mmm. [thrilling music playing] THE DELIVERY PLAN [thrilling music continues] - Let's go. - Okay! [Dong-wook] First, our car needs to be cool. We'll turn it into a Pony pick-up. [Yoon-hee] Engine's coming down. [Dong-wook] The engine will be from the Grandeur. The suspension and the seats will be from the Concord. [rattling] We'll combine three cars into one. The three of us need to be in the car, so we'll upgrade the Pony to seat three people. - The key part of this plan... - Stop! ...is the intercooler. This is so cool. I've always wanted to do this. [grunts] Cooler, cooler, intercooler! Cool! [Dong-wook] What color should it be? All black. [hissing] [anticipatory music playing] - [laughter] - Good job. [Dong-wook] We'll inch up the tires and lower the body. The handle will be a D-curve. Yes. - With a side of hydraulics. - [engine starts] [engine purring] Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah... Yo, yo! Mixtape to make you drive faster. You get it? Your own vibe. Drift the car with a tempo. Okay? - Okay? - Peace! Good shit. [Bok-nam] Let's go. [chuckles] [funky music playing] Have fun now. You got this! Let's do this! LARGE BBANGKKU [engine purring] Driver! Start your engine! [rumbling] [screeching] Go! [screeching] SEOUL STATION [Secretary Kim] You'll start your deliveries today. You must make sure that you're never late. Once you've completed your delivery, you'll get a stamp. WELL DONE! NAMDAEMUN Make half the deliveries, and you'll get a bonus from the president each time you get five stamps. - [Bok-nam] We got another stamp? - [Joon-gi] Good work, right? [hip-hop music playing] [siren wailing] HAN RIVER [club music playing] [tires screech, engine rumbles] [club music continues] Thank you. [blows] [sniffs] Thank you! [Bok-nam] Dong-wook, one apple and one grape. EULJIRO [grunting] - [Bok-nam] Dong-wook! Hurry, hurry! - [Joon-gi] What's going on? - [gasps] - [police grunting] [cop 1] Get up! - [siren wails] - [cop 1] Stop right there! [cop 2] Hey, you! [gasps] It's the cops! - Ah! - We need to go! - [engine rumbles] - [siren wailing] [siren wailing continues] [tires screeching] [siren wailing] Well, that's why you were followed. It's not a fucking fashion show. Why do you have to be so ostentatious? Do you have no shame? I'm not ashamed, sir. - True. - [chuckling] No matter where we go, the cops always find us. Director Lee has me worried. He's watching. That's because Lee Hyeon-gyun doesn't trust you. And the cops, they have orders. The new resident of The Blue House is trying to get the dirt on the former resident. He wants him to cough out the money he stole. You guys are moving it before he can get it. Hmm. Which house is the blue one? - Hey. - Hey. Please don't talk. Also, I saw their men take something else out of the boxes other than the stuffed tigers. You know about this? [intriguing music playing] [clattering] There's also a secret room inside the penthouse. Really? The accounting ledger is probably hidden in there. Ms. Kang is very careful. You know, Ms. Kang likes me a lot. So I can look into it. Just watch what they're doing. Don't do anything stupid. Don't get hurt. I'm gonna make some drinks. Give 'em to me. - How many deliveries you have left? - We're almost done with them. - We have a couple more and... - Why would you mix beer and soju? I wish you success with your deliveries. May they go smoothly. Here, drink up. This is my invention. It's called "so-beer." - It's totally bomb. - Hey! - Yo! - [all exclaiming] [upbeat music playing] [laughter] [upbeat music continues] BONUS [chuckles] We got a bonus! [rain pattering] [whirring] Hey! What are you doing? - Take a look at this. - Huh? Ooh! It's not bad. Coke! - [record scratching] - [funky music playing] [whooping] Yeah! John! Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! - What's gotten into him? Hey! - Hey! - [whooping] - [gasps] [all exclaiming] - You asshole! - [screams] [laughter] - All right! Here we go! - You're asking for it now. [all laughing] Hmm. You're looking good lately. Not working too hard? Is it obvious? I get paid ten times more than at the clubs. I'll be fine working at Madam President's parties. - Best job ever. - Whatever. "Madam President"? You're basically her lapdog now, aren't you? [laughs] I'm a real piece of shit. At school, I was worried about social justice and stuff. For someone who's never been to America, you sure talk like one. It's like you were born there. [all laughing] Appearance is all that matters. Faith, hope, love, and good looks. I can tell that you majored in theology in college. - I am so blessed. - My Lord! Hallelujah! How much do you think an apartment like that costs? One hundred million won. That's what people said on TV. - [gasps] - That's expensive as hell. It doesn't even look that cool. It looks really cool, actually. Hey, shouldn't you head out? What if you get caught? I was about to leave anyway. I have something to do in Apgujeong. [Yoon-hee] Are you going on a date? Who is it this time? Yoon-gea? You psychic or something? [laughs] - Help me, Lord! Amen. Bye. - Bye. What? Do we know her, huh? Those glasses are ugly. Why did you buy them? They're not ugly. - Wait. What's that? Hey. What's that? - It looks good on you. - Wow! That's... - Wow. Cool! [Bok-nam] Look at this, Joon-gi. - It's a Mercedes-Benz! - It has wipers on the headlights! - Wow. Those tires! - Steel-belted radios, they're so cool. - Look at this stamp, Joon-gi. - Wow, Mercedes-Benz is a nice car. Why is this window so dark? Holy shit! Excuse me, Madam President. How are you? Oh, hello. You all look so stylish. Hey, what can I say? We do clean up nicely. [Kang] That's nice. I prepared something for you, since you're getting a present today. - I hope you like them. - A present! [chuckles] You can get it from my secretary. - What does she have there? Is it a bag? - What is it? [car door closes] Okay. See you all later. - Goodbye, Ms. Kang. - Thank you. Goodbye, then. Beautiful car. An envelope. What is it? [Bok-nam] Purchase contract? An apartment? - Huh? - Is this... - That's right. It's your bonus. - Oh wow. Wait, th-this apartment, where is it? [intriguing music playing] - It's that one! - [gasps] [chuckles] Oh my god! - Dong-wook... Dong-wook, we're rich now! - [laughter] Yeah! That's like... like, the Los Angeles and Beverly Hills of Korea! Right? - Yes, yes, yes. - Wow! Look, guys, this place has two whole bathrooms! Oh my god! I get my own bathroom! - Do we need to go to California? - Oh! - [laughing] - Here's the key and some money for dinner. You don't have any deliveries today so just enjoy yourselves. [Bok-nam] Wow! - [Joon-gi] Apgujeong! [laughs] - Wow. [Joon-gi and Bok-nam whooping] [Bok-nam] Joon-gi, how many zeros are there? One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight, 100 million. - Whoa! - Oh yeah! Step on it! [all whooping, laughing] - [Yoon-hee screaming] - [boys whooping] Faster! MBC CAMERA RAID We're in front of a nightclub in Itaewon. It is now past midnight. This place is an entertainment district with over 280 neon signs. - Hey! Whoa! - Sir, can you tell me why you're fighting? - This asshole hit me first. - What are you doing? - He hit me first! - You're drunk! These men are causing a very public disturbance here tonight. - Please, sir, go home. - Did you hit me? It wasn't me, sir. - I've tried to stop them... - [drunk chatter] Nobody else is trying to stop them. - Asshole! - Please don't do this, sir. They look so stupid when they're drunk and fighting like little boys. [John] Let go of me. You need to be able to control yourself sometimes. You can't stay there! You're out here pretty late. Are you not worried about what other people will think? Not at all. I don't care what people think. I wear what I want. Because I love the way I look. [clears throat] Very good. I'm Reporter Ji Pyeong-hwan, - reporting for MBC Camera Raid. - [retching] [Ahn] Have you lost your minds? Why would you let your face be caught on camera? Are you insane? Huh? Stay on your toes! [reporter] The festival is arranged by the... Wow, I can't believe we made the news. What a milestone! This should be a family heirloom. Wow, Joon-gi. Your liver must be made of steel. I'm suffering over here. SEOUL OLYMPIC LIVE BROADCAST WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER [Bok-nam] What's that? PRE-SHOW EVENT SOBANGCHA Hey, that's SoBangCha. Let's go see SoBangCha! [newscast on TV] Come on, let's go see SoBangCha! Please? Can we go see SoBangCha? Come on. Please. You can ride on my motorcycle if we go. - Let's go, please. - SoBangCha? You're making me nauseous. I'm still hungover. I'm not going. - ...SoBangCha, Byeon Jin-su, Lee Ji-young... - [Yoon-hee] Lee Sang-eun. You know that song "Damdadi" by Lee Sang-eun? [Yoon-hee sings] ♪ Damdadi, damdadi, damdadidam ♪ - Listen, you wanna go see "Damdadi"? - Stop bugging me. ♪ Damdadidam ♪ Why haven't you started your motorcycle yet? - [squeals] Should I go start it? - [groans] You know that we have a delivery at three today, right? - [Yoon-hee] Yeah. - Don't get caught on camera!

[honking] [honking continues] - [tires screeching] - [car honking] [honking impatiently] [unsettling music playing] [tires screeching] [ominous music sting] [engine roaring] - [Dong-wook grunts] - [tires screeching] Dong-wook, watch out! [clanking] [car engine rumbling] [screeching] Ah, shit! [ominous music sting] - Huh? - [truck door slams] Are you not gonna greet your superior? - What? - Ah, shit. [sighs] Such bad manners. I'll fix that today, for sure. [grunting] [gasps] Shit! [grunting] - What do you think you're doing? - [Lee] Oh, I'm so scared. But, you're the ones who should be. None of you were taking this seriously. Right? [unsettling music playing] Oh no. [Lee] All right, who wants to choose? You want to? You fucking psycho. What are you talking about? [Yoon-hee exhales] Ah! Ow! - [Joon-gi] Hey. - Shit. [grunts] - [goon] Stay still. - [groans] [Joon-gi] Dong-wook! [grunting] [groaning] [gun cocks] [gasps] Why did you meet with him? What are you doing, you crazy son of a bitch? Meet up with who? We didn't meet with anyone? You really thought that I wouldn't find out? If you don't start talking by the time I count to three, I'm gonna blow your little sister's head off. One. We didn't meet with anyone, please don't! Director Lee, please! No, no, no, Director. Why are you doing this? Why? We don't know anything, I swear. Stop fucking around and put that gun away! - You son of a bitch! - Two... - Okay, stop. Please! - [exhales] Hey, shoot me! Shoot me! Kill me, you crazy asshole! Kill me, not her! All right. [Joon-gi whimpering] [Dong-wook grunts] [breathing shakily] [foreboding music playing] - [sobs] Dong-wook, don't! - No! [breathing heavily] Do you have any last words? [breathing nervously] [tense music playing] [Lee] Three. - [clicks] - [groans] [Lee guffawing] Hey, hey. Did I scare you? [laughs] I did. Yeah, you're scared. [guffawing] I'm not gonna kill you, you dumbasses. [tense music playing] Hey! I was just messing with you. Don't look so upset. You passed the test! Real men know how to keep a secret. THE 12TH PRESIDENT Since you've passed the test, let me give you your prize. And remember, don't get sloppy because you think Ms. Kang's got your back. If you try to fuck with the general's business, I will kill you. You will all get a bullet straight to the face! You got that? Don't lose focus, you hear me? Dismissed! - [gun fires] - [gasps] [laughing] [exhales] [car doors closing] [Lee] One of the smugglers was caught by the police. What a useless piece of shit. Before any information is learned, quickly take care of the money left in the temple. [foreboding music playing] [engine rumbling] Yoon-jae. Is there a party tonight? Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot to contact you. It was canceled. Oh well, there's no need to be sorry. [soft chuckle] [chuckling] Have you had dinner yet? - [soft chuckle] - [elevator dings] [keys jangle] [clinking] [men] Yeah. Don't know why she wanted to play golf in the middle of the night. [laughs] Isn't this nice, though? [President Kim] Mr. Lee, remind me, which sport were you in charge of? Probably wrestling. You should just watch sports on TV. Why would they make you do all that? Huh? Oh. There's Ms. Kang. Gentlemen, have you been having a good time? [men laughing] We've just been here waiting for you, Ms. Kang. [all laughing] Oh, stop it, Mr. Lee. Now, Ms. Kang... things are feeling a bit tense nowadays, with these tax audits. Right, the tax audits. Well, if you don't like the tax audits, you should make sure to get a lot of gold medals. - [laughter] - Remember what the general said? He promised that if you get good results in the Olympics, he wouldn't do tax audits. Right? We don't know if the next big man will keep that promise, you see? Darn, now I wish I'd went to the Korean Military Academy! [laughter] - [President Lee] Listen to this guy. - Uh... You're acting like a bunch of whiny babies. Do understand that the general would never steal from someone else's... pockets. The donations that you gave will only be used for one purpose. We're going to use those funds to build a new foundation. Now, it's almost time for the general to arrive. So let's wrap things up, shall we? I called the Public Prosecutor General today. [tense music playing] [foreboding music playing] [sighs] [inhales] Wow, you put something like this on your arm? Looks like you have a pretty wild side. I wish that was true. It's just a mark. An honorary scar. Yeah, she doesn't give this mark to... just anyone. Ms. Kang did this? Wow, that's messed up. [Secretary Kim] She's a scary woman. That's why even the general won't mess with her. [chuckles] So, are we dead meat if we get caught together? [both chuckle] Don't even joke about that. We'd get in a huge trouble. I'll go shower first. [door closing] [shower running] [tense music playing] [breathing nervously] [exhales] [Ahn] I sent my boys to Holes R Us to check everything. They didn't find any eavesdropping devices. This is it. I want out. Didn't you start all this knowing that it wasn't gonna be easy? I thought I agreed to be a mule, nothing more, nothing less. So why does that keep changing? I've gotten a lot of information, thanks to you. Now, if John gets me a copy of that key... Do you think that John is an actual spy or something? You know that if we get that key, then we can get a hold of their secret ledger? Fuck the ledger! John could get killed working for you! [sighs] [Ahn] Okay, Dong-wook. Let's take a minute to think about this from the very beginning. You want to go to the US? Did you forget our agreement already? Besides, if I wanted to, I could send you all to prison. You forget about the United States. [scoffs] Do whatever you want, but my mind's made up. I'm getting out of this shit. Hey, Park Dong-wook! Don't you want to know how corrupt your country is behind the scenes? Don't you wanna know why I'm trying so hard to throw that fucking piece-of-shit dictator in jail? I love my country. The US and cars. That's all you think about. Vain, thoughtless dickheads like you are the reason why those assholes can step all over our citizens and live like kings off their backs! That money that you're delivering was made from the blood and sweat of people like us. [scoffs] If we don't stop them, there's no way to keep them from taking everything. Do you think that... that you could live with that? [exhales] I didn't realize until today that you could be so self-righteous. I'm sorry, but I only care about myself. Things like patriotism or justice? I'm more important to me than any of that shit. And the reason why I want to move to the United States... is not because of vanity. It's because I have a dream. [slams] [sighs] Keys in my pocket. John in the house! Joon-gi, what are you doing? Shh! [John] What? What happened? Did someone die? Bok-nam. Why is he so quiet? Is he sick? [sighs] That damn "Damdadidam." It's not like we knew that would happen. What did we do wrong? Come on, what's going on? [sighs] Shit. Well, a few hours ago, we... Never mind. Why did you come back so early, John? The Holes R Us spy mission complete. My name is Bond, John Bond. [Joon-gi] Huh? Is this it? Really? Wow! Did you really get it? [John] You did all the hard work. Made by Joon-gi! This is it. [inhales sharply] We can get all those sons of bitches with this. With this, we can get rid of that piece of shit! Whoo! I want Dong-wook to witness my accomplishment. Where is he? Dong-wook is in the office. He's packing. Why? Where is he going? Dong-wook, what's up? [Dong-wook] A friend from Saudi Arabia told me that he got a ship. I'm gonna take everyone and leave Korea. And where are you gonna go? Didn't you hear what happened? Yeah, I did. But they're okay now. Director Lee is a lunatic, you know that. Someone could have died, asswipe. Yoon-hee and Bok-nam could have died, you fucking dumbass! Hey, don't get so pissed. Dong-wook. I finally got the key. Once we get the ledger, we're done. Are you insane? Do you really think you're a real spy? Wake the fuck up, John. Hey. I risked my life to do this. You think I'm not fucking scared? What if something bad happens? Will you take responsibility? How can you say that after hearing what happened to us? [sighs] I'm getting out of here as soon as possible. This whole thing's been - too big for us from the very beginning. - "Too big for us" my ass, Dong-wook! Hey. You feel good about yourself running away like this? Last time, Saudi Arabia. Where are you gonna go this time? - He will erase our criminal records. - [sighs] He said he'll get our visas. Do you still think we can trust Prosecutor Ahn? Erase our records? Visas? That was all just bait, you dumbshit. You're a fucking coward. [sighs] You feel better blaming Prosecutor Ahn? He forced you to do this? We knew what we were getting into from the beginning. If we can do it... No, we're the only ones that can do it. You want to quit here and be a low-level thug - the rest of your life, huh? - [sighs] You think you're some superior motherfucker. Wow. Shit. Shit. [sighs] [John sighs] Dong-wook. [sighs] When you're racing, where are you looking? What are you talking about? Never mind. Hm. Forget it. [slams] [sighs] [groans] THE 12TH PRESIDENT [alarm blares] [clicks] Is this the right place? Huh? Over there? - Go in that way. - Oh, over here. Here? Go in that way. Yeah. - [door closes] - Wow. Oh. Hello, Prosecutor Ahn. [Joon-gi] Hello, sir? [Ahn] Good work. - We just need to get the ledger, right? - [Ahn] No. You're done now too. I don't think you're able to get in there and get the book. Who else is gonna do it? You don't trust us? After all that you made us do? [Ahn] It's not that. Dong-wook talk to you guys? [groans] I didn't think they would do something so crazy. You're really tripping me up here. Why so serious all of a sudden? I'm totally fine. We're totally fine. [Bok-nam] Yeah, we are. Director Lee might be a nutjob, but he's nothing compared to Yoon-hee. - Yoon-hee is the biggest nutjob I know. - Shut it. Director Lee, that fucking psycho? How dare he do that to us? [John] You see? We can't back out now. Let's finish this. We have our pride. We know that you don't have anyone else, so just tell us what to do. [thumps] Yeah, we want to get the job done. [chuckles] Bunch of idiots. You can do this? Don't you worry. Normal people like us are perfect for jobs like this. No one will even notice we screwed over those scumbags. Right? Yeah, let's get it! Let's go! Whoo! [chuckles] [clicks tongue] You see, I'm actually a very skilled black belt. - Oh, he's lying again. - Director Lee, I could totally take him. By the way... - I'm returning them. - Thank you. [chuckles] [reporter] The athletes are entering the country in order to compete in the Seoul Olympics, the big global festival. They are all looking bright and strong, just like our beautiful fall weather. [Ahn] Ms. Kang is gonna be out of the hotel for an event. She's got more security than normal. You need to work quickly and get out of there as soon as possible. [exhales nervously] [mischievous music playing] I left something inside. [doorbell rings] Mm. Shh. [upbeat music playing] You think she's gonna be out late? We'll see, depends if there's a party after. [clicking] [upbeat music intensifies] - What's wrong with this thing? - Hey, turn it down! Yeah, yeah. This thing suddenly stopped working. Hey, move out of the way, DJ. Why'd you mess with it? Oh man. [guard 1] Come on, turn it off. - Why did this turn on? - [guard 2] We didn't touch it. Huh? [employee] Excuse me. Oh! Oh! Oh! - Search everywhere. - [men] Yes, ma'am. Just unplug it. Wait, if you unplug it like that... Oh great, the music finally turned off! [funky music playing] [chuckles softly] [gasps] - Shit! - Huh? - You scared the fuck out of me! - Ow! Why'd you hit me? - I'm gonna kill you! - [groans] - What? - Kang. - What'd you say? - Ms. Kang is here! - What? - Go back over there, okay? I'm going. [thrilling music playing] [sighs] [exhales deeply] Oh! Madam President. Mm. [Kang] Ah, to be young. You're at the age where you think you're invincible. We'll see you soon. Yes, ma'am. See you soon. [cart rattling] [funky music playing] [gasps] [panting] There! - Hey! Stop right there! - Oh shit! [panting] [gasps] [panting] [grumbles] Asshole! You could've gotten me killed! Well, you're not dead, are you? Sh... [clears throat] How did you know I was here? Did you talk to the prosecutor? I figured you'd do it without me, but you'd be lost. [scoffs] Anyway, this is finally over. Let's hand over the books, get our visas, and go to LA! By the way, your makeup... Can you do something about that before you go to LA... - [groans] - It's not just makeup. - You're gonna make me crash the car. - It's a disguise. [sighs] You might as well be wearing a mask. - Not another word. - We're gonna crash. - That mouth of yours, I'm gonna... - I'm gonna crash for real! [John] Where are you gonna go this time? He will erase our criminal records. - He said he'll get our visas. - [Dong-wook sighs] [Dong-wook] Do you still think we can trust Prosecutor Ahn? Erase our records? Visas? That was all just bait, you dumbshit. [slams] [sighs] What do you think you're doing? They stabbed you in the back, Ms. Kang. [sighs] It's not a big deal. Let's talk about this calmly and quietly. Our delivery drivers are working for the prosecutor's office. So what? So they have ruined all of the general's plans! Those fuckers have taken our books and gave it to the enemy! I'm gonna catch those assholes and kill every one of them! All of this happened because you're too soft on them! Hey! I'm gonna report this to the general. This... This... He would never stand for this! [yells] [groans] Ah! [tense music playing] [breathing shakily] [Kang] Director Lee. No. Hyeon-gyun. If you're barking at the person who's taking care of you, then you're going to learn to control your volume, you son of a bitch, huh? [exhales] I'm sorry, ma'am. [sighs] Now, leave. [glass thuds] Ms. Kim. Ma'am. Go to Myeongdong, and get ready to exchange the money in the temple to US dollars. That will make it easier to transport. Right away, ma'am. Yoon-jae. Yes, ma'am. Wait to eat dinner. When you get back, we can eat together. Okay. [footsteps receding] Hey, they're here, they're here. - You traitors! - Are you okay? Are you hurt? Does loyalty mean anything to you? - How could you just leave me back there? - What are you talking about? - I was coming back for you. Hey, come on. - I'm gonna kill you! - Can't hold her back. - I'm gonna kill you! Come here! - [Yoon-hee yelling] - You made your entrance at the very end - so you can look cool? - [Bok-nam] Ow! Why'd you do that? Why did you come back? I'll take that as "thanks." [John] Huh? Look at this. [sighs] Hey. - Is this the right place? - Yeah. This is Prosecutor Ahn's desk. What the fuck happened here? Hey, look at this. These are our visas. Let's get out of here. Quick. [breathing nervously] Hey, wait, wait. [screaming in distance] That's Prosecutor Ahn. [sighs] Hey, go to the car and wait for me. You go and start the car. I'll take a quick look. [panting] [crashes] [inhales sharply] [breathing shakily] [breathing heavily] [unsettling music playing] [breathing heavily] [moaning] [groans] [labored breathing] [breathing heavily] Go... [exhales] Go... [exhales] [John] Dong-wook! - Dong-wook! - [goon 1] Get him! Start the car! Start the car! [John grunting] - Dong-wook! - Stop right there! - [all grunting] - [metal clanging] - [engine sputters] - [goons grunt] - [John] Dong-wook! Dong-wook! - [goon 2] Stay still! Go, you idiot! Go! I said go! [Lee] Open the door! Open it! - You son of a bitch! - Dong-wook! [groans] [yelling] Dong-wook! [groans] - Hey, open the door! Quickly! Open it! - [sobs] - Go, you idiot! - Shut up! [grunts] - [engine roaring] - Hey! Hey! [grumbles] [goons yell] [car roaring] [sighs] [door opens] [coughing] [sighs] [Yoon-hee sighs] Here's Dad's ignition switch. Dong-wook, what should we do now? Director Lee's a son of a bitch. We need to go. We have to find John. We can't leave him. Yeah, let's go. [sighs] [John screaming] [squeaking] [John] You son of a bitch! [grunting] Stop it, Director Lee. - We don't have the time for this. - [panting] [groans] [Kang] Did you know people can really endure a lot of pain? [panting] Unwrap it and show him what we have. [rustling] [John gasps] [retches] - [Kang] Look at it, Mr. DJ. - [breathing shakily] Whose is this? [John whimpering] You know this hand, don't you? Right? What did you do? Huh? [panting] - People don't die just from losing a hand. - [John] Fuck! You call yourselves human beings? I guess our poor DJ really liked Ms. Kim. [breathing heavily] Still, love is just love. Your life is more important, yes? Where's the ledger? Fuck you. Fuck you! You bitch! [yells] [shattering] Wake him up. It's fine. That's enough. He's not gonna talk. You can come in. How did you... We wouldn't get help from any old prosecutor. I talked to the Public Prosecutor General to get them out. So take them to the temple with you, and take care of the money. - [line rings] - [sighs] Quick, the news, it's starting. - Yoon-hee. - Yeah. I'm calling Mom. Keep calling till she picks up. - Go. - Hurry. Hurry. [reporter] He was beaten by the main suspect, Park Dong-wook and his accomplices. After beating Prosecutor Ahn, Park Dong-wook and his gang - pushed him out of the fourth floor... - [Bok-nam] What are they saying? - Prosecutor Ahn fell on top of a car... - Can you believe this bullshit? They're saying we killed the prosecutor! Whoa, they think we did it? [Joon-gi] Assholes! They've crossed the line! - Fuck! - [sighs] - [TV report continues] - [groans] Dong-wook, Mom says everything's okay on her end. [reporter] Bundles of cash, worth around one billion won, and 300 artifacts, were discovered in the walls of the master bedroom. This apartment was under the name of Park Yoon-hee, a woman who has recently been confirmed to be their accomplice. In addition, Park Yoon-hee was confirmed to be the sister of the main culprit, Park Dong-wook. The police, who are tracking the culprits, think that they are still hiding within the city of Seoul, and have increased the frequency of vehicle searches at checkpoints. However, they have not yet pinpointed their exact location. The police advice the culprits to turn themselves in - before they are caught... - [clicks] [pop music playing] [chuckles] [tape screeches] [Kang] Excuse me for a moment, General Jeon, why don't you say a few words for us since the Public Prosecutor General came all this way to play golf? [General Jeon] Yes, of course. Yes. [inhales sharply] I won't forget each of you who showed your loyalty to your country. Thanks to you, this country has become a better place to live. Aside from setting up our foundation, there will be a lot more opportunities for us to collaborate in the future. GAJU CONSTRUCTION Why did you want to see me? To turn yourself in? This is Ms. Kang's accounts ledger. And the location of everything... is in here. [sighs] I'm sorry, but this is out of my hands now. The Public Prosecutor General is working for them. Even if you bring me the original, there's nothing I can do. I'm gonna prove we're innocent. I'll show them who the real criminals are. I'm going to get all the money that we've delivered and everything that's left... and destroy it right in front of those motherfuckers' faces. They won't get a single one. You'll need more than circumstantial evidence. Yeah. Mm. Let this go. Let this go? Really? Shit. I don't even know if my friend is fucking alive or dead, goddammit! I will do this, even if it kills me. That is the promise I am making to you. [Woong-in] What's this? [Dong-wook] It was in Prosecutor Ahn's car. The man who gave his life for that probably wouldn't have hesitated. [engines rumbling] [suspenseful music playing] [gasps] Hey. What are you doing? I need to see where they're going. Wait here. What do you mean, wait? Hey, come back, Dong... No. - Where is he going? - What's he doing? [Joon-gi] What's gotten into him? Dong-wook! [vehicle approaching] - Huh? Where's Dong-wook going? - Oh! Oh! [Joon-gi] Dong-wook! [mischievous music playing] Look, look. - So there's just one left, correct? - Yes, ma'am. First load is headed to the airport, the rest will be sent - the day of the opening ceremony. - That good. The opening ceremony. That's the perfect day, won't draw attention. Okay. I'll see you then. [Lee] Yes, ma'am. Oh shit. [Bok-nam] Where did he go? [Dong-wook grunting] [groans] [moans] [Dong-wook panting] [sighs] Hi-ya! Hi-ya! You know I'm a really impressive guy. Joon-gi, it's our turn. Are you ready? I'm ready. - [clanging] - [both whimper] [panting] I found them. [sighs] - [guards] Whoa! - [shouting] Come out, you crazy nutjob! [gunshots] [breathing heavily] [Lee] I didn't hit you? [inhales sharply] It's so hard to aim these things. What? - What? - I want John back. Oh, that's so touching. What if I don't want to? Oh, you'll want to, when you see my cards. [sighs] [Lee] What's this? You got nothing. "I fold." Yeah. I've got an ace up my sleeve. Wanna see it? Go ahead. Show 'em. I want John first. Bring him out. [John groaning] [John] Aah! - [groans] - [Joon-gi] John! What a nice reunion. Your friend is pretty weak, this one. He should have stuck to the DJ booth. Not sleeping with the wrong woman. You sons of bitches! Shit! [Bok-nam growls] Fuck, you really are just a dumb dog. That's why you didn't notice that your master abandoned you. What are you saying? Joon-gi. [Dong-wook] Here! This is today's song. [clicks] [General Jeon] I won't forget each of you who showed your loyalty to your country. Thanks to you, this country has become a better place to live. Aside from setting up our foundation, there will be a lot more opportunities for us to collaborate - in the future. - What's this? You need to listen all the way through. [President Park] Excuse me, sir, and if the foundation doesn't work out, then who will take the fall? [Kang] That sounds like a question for me. All the necessary preparations have been made. Remember meeting Director Lee Hyeon-gyun? [clicks] This is the perfect time for a commercial break, isn't it? Shut up and play it! [clicks] [Kang] Ah, he loves to sacrifice himself. [General Jeon] Hm, that's right. He was too stupid to go to the Military Academy. - But he's loyal. - [Kang laughs] - He can take quite a few hits. - [laughter] So there's no need to worry. Bring that shit over here. [Kang] Oh, General Jeon, you're funny! [laughing] Fuck, is this all you have? [grunts] You motherfuckers! Who do you think I am? Shit! I'll fucking kill you. - You goddamn son of a bitch. - Oh, come on. You broke it, but it doesn't matter. I can get you 100 copies of it if you'd like. [tapes clattering] [grunts] - [clicks] - [yawning] [Dong-wook] Someone's making more copies as we speak, Director Lee. To those bastards, you are nothing but a dog. You gonna run with your tail between your legs after you help steal the money just 'cause your master abandoned you? What are you saying? You think the prosecutor you killed was working on this alone? Prosecutor's office should be here soon. Why should I care? I'm saying that I'll help you. You? Help me? Just give me the location, and I'll make the delivery. Don't you know? I'm the best driver in the world. So you want me to betray the general? For a billion won, I'll do it for you. Or you could go to prison for them. You could take a few hits, after all. - Shit. - [grunts] [cocks gun] If you're fucking with me, I'll kill you for real. And this time, my guys will be joining you. I hope they don't get car sick. It'll be one hell of a ride. [car zooming] - [Galchi] Ah, cute. - [Gyu-hyeong] Yeah. [Galchi] You're so handsome. Who do you take after? [Gyu-hyeong] Me. Me. You look like me, don't you? Hm? [Su-hyeong] So handsome. [Galchi] Hey! - No, Ma! - Oh! I told you not to do that! - This is the best spot to dry them. - Those peppers... Then why don't you park your car somewhere else, huh? You're gonna make my car all hot! Bullshit. [car approaching] Auntie. I'm here. - Oh my goodness. - Auntie! Hey! What do you think you're doing, you murderers? How dare you come here? Get lost! Ow! [groans] Hee-young, you be nice to your friends. - Ah, Dong-wook! - Auntie! - Auntie! - Joon-gi! [all laughing] Welcome. Welcome, boys. - Have you eaten already? [laughs] - Yes, ma'am. Hey. It's a shame what happened to Holes R Us. It's just a tragedy. My mom wanted me to say hello from America. I was just about to send her a letter as well. Auntie... could we... use your garage for a day or two? What? No way! No! No way! Ah! [groans] Yes. Of course you can. Anything for you. - Go ahead, take whatever you need. - Yeah! But, Mom! What are you doing? You know that they're our competition. Ah! Ah! [groans] Put on a real shirt. Do you have anything other than filthy tank tops? - This is called fashion! - Fashion? You don't dress me anymore. - This is fashion! - [Galchi's mom chuckles] That's a bunch of bullshit, you know that? [laughter] I'll whip up something for you to eat, okay? - [Dong-wook, Joon-gi] Thanks. - [laughs] [scoffs] No way. I won't... ever allow it. RUN-DMC, Raising Hell. Still no. No. No. Can't do it. [sighs] I didn't wanna have to do this. [car door opens] Air Jordans 3, limited edition. [funky music playing] [Gyu-hyeong] Jordan 3? Limited edition. [Su-hyeong] Wow! Wow. [clears throat] - [Gyu-hyeong] Look! - [Su-hyeong] Wow. One day. Just... one day. Deal. - [Gyu-hyeong] Wow. - [Su-hyeong] Whoa. - Air Jordans. - Holy shit! Whoa! [gasps] [Galchi] Amazing. [Dong-wook] Our D-Day is the opening ceremony of the Olympics. I'll move the money and the goods left in the safe all at once. [suspenseful music playing] My destination, the Port of Incheon. Director Lee seems to be planning to run away with the goods. Our priority, getting John back. Once John is safe, that's when we'll make our move. - [Joon-gi] What about... - [Yoon-hee] The car? - [Joon-gi] You think this car will work? - [Dong-wook] We'll make it work. We'll do it our way. [all laugh] [Galchi] In one... - One... - [Gyu-hyeong] Two, three! - Come on! [grunting] - [Galchi shouting] [Dong-wook] We're doing this Olympic-style. [hissing] You're doing everything just like we planned? [Bok-nam] Don't worry about the tapes. Don't worry about the recording. [Yoon-hee] I'll be sure to fill in the empty spot left by John. [clicks] [Dong-wook] Here. Okay. [Dong-wook] All of you, remember this. 88 SEOUL VIBE Joon-gi, you've got Hangang Park. Bok-nam, you got Olympic-daero. Galchi, you've got the parade at the main stadium. Yoon-hee, airport. Not Gimpo, but Seongnam. We are going to get Ms. Kang and Director Lee in the same place. And, we'll drag them down with us. Don't forget to be really fucking annoying too. - [Galchi's mom] Here. [laughs] - Bravo! [all cheering] Enjoy! [indistinct chatter] It's one of John's. I made some improvements. All pop songs? You can listen to all the hip-hop you want in LA. - Today you get this. - You remember what to do? When you get the call, make sure you... [sighs] Shit. [upbeat music playing] [Dong-wook] Three. Two.

[chuckling] Make sure to tell Dong-wook that I've put my life on the line too. Roger that, sir. [laughs] All right. You can leave. Before you give me a headache. Leave. Commoners unite when faced against the authority! [laughs] [car rumbling] You just can't be subtle, can you? Think this car is loud enough? Just load it up. Okay? - Load it. - [men] Yes, sir!
