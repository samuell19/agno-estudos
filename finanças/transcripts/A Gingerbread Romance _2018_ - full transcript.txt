This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Come on, Taylor, we're almost done packing. Taylor? It's time to go. Mom, what if Santa doesn't find us this time? Remember what I told you before our last move? Wherever you hang your stocking is where Santa will find you. And he did, didn't he? Let's see today's creation. Sweetheart, I think it's your best yet. Hey, gang... The airport limo's here. So... Ready for our next adventure? You bet! Hi. Hey, stranger! Merry Christmas. How was Tucson? Or was it Seattle? I'm sorry, Taylor, I can't keep all your travels straight. It was L.A. this time... I think. So you in town for Christmas? You've got to come by. I'm not sure yet, but I should know soon. Thanks, Wendy. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Hi, Mom! Taylor, sweetheart, I hope it's not too late, but I wanted to catch you before we went to breakfast. Oh, don't worry, I just got home. Hi, honey. Merry Christmas! Hi, Dad! Merry Christmas to you. So how's Christmas in Singapore? Hot and humid. Now that you've seen my Christmas sweater, I'm taking it off. So how did things go in L.A.? Two sunny months, and the new condo complex is almost built... And I see you got the advent calendar I sent. But is that tomorrow's chocolate you're eating today? Isn't it only December 9th for you there? Hey, it's tomorrow in Singapore, right? This one's for you. Any chance you can join us here this Christmas? Well, I'd love to, but I may be packing the moving boxes again. I'm meeting my boss tomorrow to talk about my next assignment. Well, honey, if you're not coming here for Christmas, what will you do? Well, Wendy, she's inviting me over. I can hang my stocking there. Okay? Give Dad a big hug for me. I will. Love you. Love you, too. And I'll let you know what my boss says tomorrow. - Taylor! - Hey, Josephine! Nice to see you! Welcome back. I'd say welcome home, but you spend more time away than here. Well, I might be on the road again. I'm supposed to talk to Linda right now. How do I look? Very Merry. Good luck. Thanks. Yeah, we're excited, too, and we promise not to disappoint. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Goodbye. Wow, the Mayor? What was that about? Actually, it was partly about you. Me? Taylor, you've got a great eye... your work is always cutting-edge, and your projects always come in on time and under-budget... Thank you... And that's why the board is considering you to head up our new Paris office. Wow, that would be terrific. We'll see what happens. But in the meantime, there's this project I need your help on. I'm totally open and excited. What's the project? Okay, so you know that we submitted a proposal for the new downtown re-development project... Yes, but I thought Crestford had a lock on City Hall. According to the Mayor, we're currently his top choice. Great! In the meantime, we need to do everything that we can to up our public profile. How can I help? Well, the city's Christmas Festival is coming up, and they're doing a gingerbread house competition to raise money for charity this year. We've got a spot in the contest... and I need you to represent our firm as our designer! You want me... to design a gingerbread house? As in gumdrops and candycanes? A life-sized one, and we're talking big. Linda, I'm an architect, not a baker. And that's why I've already found you expert help. Have you ever heard of Annabelle Renard? Uh... yes. Doesn't she have a fancy restaurant downtown? She happens to be best pastry chef in the city. She's agreed to meet with you to discuss teaming up. Taylor, this is important. What do you say? You had me at gumdrops. I'm in. You're kidding me? A gingerbread house? I know. I thought I was getting Europe, but it turns out I'm getting the North Pole... But Linda wants me to do it, and it might convince the board to give me the Paris job. Hang on, where are you going? The office Christmas party starts in an hour. Oh, well, I am meeting a baker they've paired me up with. The competition starts the day after tomorrow, which means I should have started yesterday! Okay. Sounds like a plan. I'll talk to you soon. Taylor Scott! Bradford? What brings you here? Crestford just moved our offices here. We've got the top two floors now. Oh. So, I hear that you and I are going to be going head to head... Or should I say gingerbread to gingerbread? So you're doing the competition, too? Yeah. What is it about Crestford and Ogilvy? They're always so competitive. I don't know. Try asking your Crestford colleagues... since they stole you away. Well, in one sense, you've already won this one. Snagging Annabelle Renard, I hear, as your partner? That was a lucky grab, beat me to it. Thanks. Well, I'm actually late meeting her now, so I'll see you around. See you on the battlefield. Please, the marzipan first, then the piping. Get me the meringue in the kitchen. Excuse me, Annabelle? Taylor Scott. Nice to meet you. Wow, that looks amazing. This? No. This is a disaster, but I'll fix it. So tell me about this gingerbread competition. Oh, I would be honored to work on it with you. Yes, well, I do owe Linda a favor. But how much experience do you have in the kitchen? Um... actually, none. In fact, I'm pretty hopeless. Ah? But I have designed condos in Hong Kong, office parks in Seattle. I've led teams of draftspeople and engineers. So don't worry, I know how to take charge. Every ship needs a captain and I am ready to lead! So you would be in charge, huh? Oh, absolutely! Well, I see. Very impressive. I just need to get in touch with Linda first. Okay! Merci. Merci Ã  vous. Okay. Adam, let's hurry. We have three more orders to drop off. You can't rush art, Ray. Just move it along, Rembrandt. So it went okay with Annabelle? I've seen her on TV before and she seems pretty tough. I mean, obviously, she's a perfectionist, too. We're a great match. Annabelle Renard... wow. Yes, sweetheart. Just a few more deliveries and Daddy will be home. You know, I think building a gingerbread house actually might be fun. Ooh, I love it. Not your typical gingerbread house. Thanks. Ogilvy Associates? Ooh, yes. This must be the cake for our Christmas party! It's beautiful... Thanks. You just smudged green icing all over my plans. Sorry. Can't you just re-print your plans? Can you just re-print your cake? Sadly not. Excuse me. I have your Santa cupcakes in the van... - Unbelievable. - Unbelievable. Alright, folks, here they are! We have to put the hooks on them before we can put them on the tree. Okay? But they are good to eat. Hey! Every year, we have this argument, the gingerbread are for decorating, not eating! You can't blame us for liking them, they're too yummy. Just more proof your talents are going to waste at Ray's. Not all that again. All what, Daddy? Your baking is always the best. Be right back! The kid's right, Adam... You're an artist in the kitchen, but at Ray's, you paint by numbers. It's high time you opened your own bakery. Thanks, but that's Ray, and I've got a few thousand cookies to bake. This project may not have been my first choice, but I intend to make the best out of it. Oh, that's Linda right now. Hi, Linda. Yeah. I'm out doing some Christmas shopping. What's up? My blood pressure if you must know. Why? What's wrong? Oh, nothing much. Just that Crestford poached our talent again. They got Annabelle. What? How? She seemed so excited. Well, apparently, she was even more excited when Crestford offered her top billing in the competition and to use her house in an ad campaign. But she can't! Well, I suppose she can, but where does that leave us? Chef-less. Any ideas? No... but you know what, don't worry. I'll figure out something. Taylor, what happened? Annabelle dropped me. The competition starts in 24 hours, I need to find another baker, fast! Look, I totally understand it's a busy time of the year for bakers, but it's for a good cause... and a giant gingerbread house. I mean, come on, doesn't that sound like fun? Of course. I'm sorry to bother you. Merry Christmas! Hello? Le Gateau? Hi, yes. This is Taylor Scott again. I was wondering if you'd reconsidered... Hello... Hello? Hello? Any leads? Come on, Santa, can't you grant me an early wish this year? Any luck? Not yet, and I've already called half the bakeries in town. They're either not interested or they've already teamed up. So what will you do? Josephine... what bakery did you use for the Christmas party? Ray's Bakery. Why? 'Cause desperate times call for desperate measuring cups. Did you just make a baking joke? Be out in a minute. Yes. How can I help you? Uh-oh... it's you. Brooke? Hide the cakes! Look... I know we got off on the wrong foot the other day. That's putting it mildly. Daddy, you told me to always be nice to customers. Hi, I'm Brooke. Welcome to Ray's. Nice to meet you, Brooke. I'm Taylor. How can I help you? Are you Ray? I'm Adam. I work for Ray. He's not here. But you did make that amazing Christmas tree cake, right? Yeah, that's all me. And, obviously, you have a lot of experience with baking. Cookies, icing, decorating? My Dad can make anything. Ever make a gingerbread house? Dad made a whole gingerbread village one year! And what about a giant gingerbread house? Big enough to stand in. Could you make one of those? I'm not sure I understand. Look, I'm an architect, and I am representing my firm in the city's giant gingerbread house competition. Seeing that it needs to be 80% edible, I need a baker to team up with, and I'm thinking that should be you. I'm flattered, but I don't have a lot of spare time. But, Dad, it sounds so fun! Don't you have homework to do? That table right there has got your name on it. Keep your paws off the Christmas cupcakes. I've got eyes in the back of my head. Look, you have a gift. That cake was amazing and, obviously, you are a great pastry chef. I'm just a baker. Just a baker could not make that amazing Christmas tree cake. They're just a passion project my boss lets me do now and then. It doesn't really fit our clientele. I'm here to crank out the donuts and the muffins, and speaking of which... I'll be with you folks in just a second. But you have to do it! There'll be prestige, Christmas spirit, something for your free time! "Free time," that's something I don't have. But I'll be in a terrible situation if you say no! Are you trying to guilt me? I don't know. Is it working? To guilt someone, you have to know them, and, well, we don't... Fine, I'm a Sagittarius and I love Peppermint Bark. Still no. Mrs. Masy, cherry danish as usual? But it would be great exposure. I mean, everyone around the world would see your talents! I have a line. Excuse me. Here. In case you change your mind. Nice to meet you, Brooke. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. You've been twirling that card around all evening, and Brooke can't stop talking about the gingerbread competition. I can't. I've got a job, I've got responsibilities and... Ray's sons are in town to help him, and you do have weeks of unused vacation. But I don't know... Adam, don't you want Brooke to see you do something that makes you happy? This is Taylor. Hey. It's Adam. The Christmas tree cake guy? Oh, that Adam. How could I forget? I'm calling about your offer. Look, I'm... Hello? Are you still there? As difficult as it was for you to ask... it's just as difficult for me to... Accept my offer? Yes. That. So you'll do it? Yes. Great! Well, in that case, we'll start tomorrow. Sounds good. Oh, they've got pies. Want to go look? Come on, let's go look at the pies. Ooh, those pies smell good. Merry Christmas. Look. Ice sculptures! Oh, look, there's Taylor. Hey. Hi. You got that sign up quick. Our design team's pretty on the ball. Daddy, why isn't your name on it? It's fine, honey. But, Dad, you need the bubble-icity. "Bubble-icity"? Oh! Publicity! Right. Publicity! To help when he opens his own bakery! Seriously? My daughter has a big imagination, but I already have a job. Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls. May I have your attention, please? As your Mayor, I am thrilled to welcome you to our Christmas Festival and our first-ever Giant Gingerbread competition. This year, we have... Friends of yours? More like a former colleague. Bradford used to work at the firm. You can say we have a friendly rivalry going on. And Annabelle Renard... She's the best pastry chef in the state. Okay, truth is, she and I were talking about working together on this. Looks like your colleague over there made a more convincing sales pitch. Now, each team has 10 days to build their masterpiece, for final judging on December 23rd... So, without further ado... let the Giant Gingerbread Competition begin! Looks like we've got our work cut out for us. That you do. Linda, this is Adam, our baker. Nice to meet you. Likewise. We're counting on you. So think cutting-edge, and be bold with your designs. And we can win this. But no pressure, right? Tell me about it... Okay. Let's get started. Come on. Brooke, let's go find Aunt Jenny first. What is that? Plans for our gingerbread house. What? I assumed the design is something we'd come up with together. Well, I am a professional architect. I think I know what I'm doing. Really? Because that house doesn't look very Christmassy? Not Christmassy? Well, what is that supposed to mean? Well, it's so modern. It looks like a 21st-century gingerbread condo! Well, you heard my boss... It needs to be sophisticated, cutting-edge. Christmas isn't about cutting-edge, Christmas is about warmth and tradition... And thank you for your input, but I think there's been a little misunderstanding. In a construction project, an architect oversees all creative choices. And in a baking project, typically, the head chef is in charge... Of building materials. Look, all day long, I'm stuck making blueberry muffins, okay? My fingers are stained blue! This is my chance to get out and do something artistic for the week. Okay, how about you stay out of design decisions, and help with building materials? I need to be involved with the design decisions, so I can advise on which gingerbread to use for the building material! How about we agree to disagree? But at least get started in the meantime? Are you always this stubborn? I was going to say the same of you! Fine. Well, we'd better head back. We've got to start baking. First step is coming up with a gingerbread dense enough not to crumble, and that's gonna take some experimentation... Great idea. Let's go. "Let's"? Didn't you just agree to be my baking assistant? Wow, that's a huge, colossal Christmas tree... Actually, we got the small one this year. What kind of Christmas Tree do you have, Taylor? Actually, I don't usually have one. You see, I travel a lot, and they don't fit too well in a carry-on luggage. But everyone should have a Christmas Tree! Brooke, did you make that? That's beautiful! It's a school project. I'm supposed to be making a Christmas diorama, but I'm kinda stuck on making the trees... Do you want a little hint? You can make great tree trunks by wrapping sandwich twists in parchment paper. I made a lot of models when I was in architecture school. Thanks! Oh, sous-chef! You're needed. I think that means me. And I have a hint, too! When you cook with my Dad, wear an apron 'cause a lot of things splash. Wish me luck. Okay, I am ready to help. Thank you. Gingerbread batch number one is in the oven already. I had a leftover batch of dough. It just needs two more minutes. Each batch cooks six minutes. Your job is to keep track of time. Great, I'm doing the job of an egg timer. Gingerbread batch number two, I made with margarine, instead of butter. And for our third experiment, I'm substituting corn syrup for molasses. This keeps the pasty from puffing out, and maintains its shape. These are all variations on my Mom's gingerbread recipe. Hers used lots of butter... Little trick they don't teach you in culinary school... butter improves the taste of everything. But no one will taste it. You should be concerned with durability. I've never compromised on taste and I'm not about to start now. And you went to culinary school? Long story. Keep stirring. You do know they have powdered ginger? Creativity and inspiration can't be rushed, okay? Rome wasn't built in a day... And our gingerbread house won't be either. Clearly not if you're involved. Wouldn't working with a recipe be more efficient? I like to take my time, let my creativity flow. Sounds risky. Maybe, but for every fallen soufflÃ©, there's a perfect profiterole tower... You know, I'm really glad you're not an architect, because that approach would not pass inspection. Now, remember, we don't want bricks. We need thin rectangles of gingerbread. Why so thin? Well, remember my design? It calls for thin pieces of gingerbread. I need for my design to be ultra sleek and modern. But that'll make it more likely to crack. Maybe use less butter? And compromise taste and texture? What do you say we stop the backseat baking? Remember our deal? In the kitchen, I'm in charge? Yeah, but I'm the... Do you smell smoke? Okay, so our first collaboration could have gone slightly better. Hey. Morning. I wasn't expecting to see you here so early. And why not? Bakers always get up early. Well, after yesterday's fiasco, I wasn't sure... I'd show up? Well, I always finish what I start. Besides, we've got a frame to build. But first, coffee. Thank you. So you always make your own coffee? It's the most important tool we've got. And we've got a bunch of sleepy volunteers arriving this morning. Mm. Okay, I see your point. Now let's finish the base. And start shopping for ingredients if we want to start baking. I assume you have a shopping list? Sure, I do. Right up here. No list? Doesn't that seem a little off-the-cuff? I got a couple things written down, but you've got to leave room for inspiration. Inspiration sounds expensive. I think I'll tag along, too. Imported honey? When did you get that? I'm known for not skimping when it comes to quality. Well, I'm known for coming in under budget. So, did you pick up all your fancy baking skills at culinary school? A few. But I wasn't there long, maybe six months. I had to drop out. I was too busy raising Brooke on my own. We lost Brooke's mother a few years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. That must have been pretty hard. It's been a challenge, raising my baby on my own, but baking is something that always seems to put a smile on her face. So, where'd you get your passion for architecture? Seeing amazing buildings all around the world when I was growing up. I was born in Philly and lived mostly here till I was 6. My Mom's an international lawyer and my Dad's a diplomat. We moved every couple years. That's a lot of moving. Oh, no, I loved it. I mean, some kids collect dolls, I collected passport stamps. And since I'm single and love to travel, the firm, these days, sees me as the go-to-girl for far-off projects. And where do you go for Christmas? I usually visit my parents, but this year, they're in Singapore, and I have a gingerbread house to build here. So you don't miss hosting your own traditional Christmas? Wherever I hang my stocking, it's Christmas. I mean, of course, I'd love all that. It's just life turned out differently. See, that I understand, 'cause I was gonna be a world-famous pastry chef. It's never too late. Thanks. Taylor, I thought that was you. You know Annabelle, I believe? Yes, we've met. Annabelle Renard. Gold medalist at last year's European Pastry Panache Competition. Adam Dale... voted best personality in high school. Oh. Wait, you're... You're the donut guy. From Ray's... right here! You make the best jelly donuts. Yeah, that's me. And that's just his day job. Adam is a very talented patissier... Oh! How nice! May the best team win. "Talented patissier." I like the sound of that. Don't let it go to your head. Let's hurry back. We've got to meet the volunteers. Adam, this is David, our new intern at the firm. Nice to meet you. You can lose the sportsjacket. Yes, sir. And this is my friend, Josephine. Hi! Hi. And this is my neighbor, Wendy. Sorry I couldn't draft my kids, Taylor, but it's for the best, 'cause they would have just devoured the gingerbread. So, thanks for volunteering, everyone. We have a big week ahead of us, so first, we put up the frame, next, we bake, then we cover the frame with gingerbread, and the final phase... Decorating! We can make this amazing! If we stay on schedule, that is. Was that comment directed at me? Well, I'm simply reminding everyone we are on a strict time limit... Though we want everybody to feel free to follow their creativity... As long as we meet certain benchmarks and construction timetables... While making the most colorful and delicious gingerbread house we can. Okay, do you remember what we agreed on? Staying on our own side of the street? Yes, but... You're driving on my sidewalk. So... Shall we begin? How did you do that? Do what? Give me what I needed before I asked? In the kitchen, you get good at predicting who needs what and when. And you made a face? And, obviously, you still want our house to have a traditional roof. How do you know that? 'Cause you made a face. So how did you get caught up in this project anyway? My boss asked me to do it. Last month, I was crafting a 10-story condo, and this week, I am in charge of gumdrops... There's no shame in designing a gingerbread house. Well, I like a challenge. Besides just working with you. Very funny. And I'm in charge of gumdrops, by the way. Why, thank you. I'd say we made pretty good progress today. The frame's near done. So, is it true what Brooke said earlier? Do you want to open your own bakery? Wanted to. I tried a while back, but no investors wanted to fund a culinary school dropout. Well if we win, maybe you should reach out to them again. I'm doing this for one reason only, and that's to make Brooke happy. Do you think that means I lack ambition? No, you're just guilty of being a great dad. Speaking of Brooke, she wanted me to give you something. An invitation for dinner tonight. And if those instant noodle cups you snuck in with the supplies are what you're calling dinner, you have no choice but to accept our invitation. Okay. Sure. That was delicious. Thank you both for inviting me. Sp what's in the pizza anyway? Just my special recipe. Except you don't use recipes. Pecorino cheese, fennel sausage and truffle oil. Hey, Honey! Those are trade secrets. I guess Taylor is now in our circle of trust. Well anyway, that was delicious. Seriously, the best dinner I've had in months. I'm going to work on my diorama. Do you want to help? Sure. Oh... your Christmas diorama is looking better and better! You clearly have your Dad's gift for decorating. It just takes so long, though. I need a herd of reindeer, and each reindeer takes forever to draw... Well, it doesn't have to. All you need is a template. Just think of it as a Christmas cookie-cutter, but for art projects. Here, let me show you... Let's draw our reindeer... Now... all we need to do is cut it out. There we go. And... we've got... a master stencil... to create... all the reindeer we need. Voila. Wow! Thanks, Taylor! Well, like I said, you have a great eye for decorating. So I propose we make you "Chief Decorating Officer" for the Gingerbread house. That is, if that doesn't step on anyone's toes? I'd be more than happy to share the glory. Yes! Thanks for the ride. I had to. You're the only adult I know in Philly who doesn't own a car. Cute. She's a great kid. Well, she certainly seems to have taken a liking to you. So, you even decorate your truck for Christmas? Our house is so decorated, my truck got a little jealous. That's your house? The one on the end there? You don't have any decorations up. Who's got the time? No Christmas decorations? You know, if one of the gingerbread judges saw this, we'd be disqualified for lack of Christmas spirit! No wonder you don't know what a real gingerbread house should look like! Oh, please... It should be colorful, warm and inviting. It should be decorated to the hilt but with love. It should make you think of your Grandma's house. Well, my grandmother lives in a high-rise in Tampa. Good night. Hey... the first item in your Christmas decoration kit... This? What can I say? It's a start. Okay, can you... Take the last tray out of the oven? I'm on it... Hot. Can you pass me the... Spatula? Here. We need to wait until these are nice and dry so that... The frosting adheres. Hey, did you notice? What? The smell of nothing burning. Amazing, right? I'd say our second collaboration is a teeny bit better than our first. That isn't saying much. Well, well, well, it looks like the elves have taken over my kitchen. Tired elves. Taylor, meet my boss, Ray. It's nice to meet you, Ray. Thank you so much for letting us use your kitchen. No problem. Adam, can I talk to you for a minute? That's quite a project you two have going. Hey, don't worry about it. I can keep up with the muffins and the bagels. I know... And I know I've got you baking below your potential. I like working here, okay? You're a good boss. You know, I'd let you bake the fancy stuff full-time, but this is an old family bakery. I've had customers here for the last 20 years... And "Our customers only want the basics." Yeah, I know. You read my mind. Anyway, this week, sky's the limit and my kitchen's at your command. You know, I'd offer to help, but it looks like you two have the situation in hand. Thanks again for letting us bake here. My pleasure. Good luck. Our gingerbread needs five hours to cool, so can I suggest a break? - You busy? - Why? I've got to get some stocking stuffers for Brooke, and since you're a Philly native, maybe it's time you get re-acquainted with how your home town celebrates Christmas? Okay. Let's do it. I can't believe you're not cold. It feels good after being near the ovens all day. Is this really your first Christmas in Philadelphia? As an adult, yeah. So you have no Christmas memories here as a kid? Well, it feels familiar, but cloudy, kind of like in a snowglobe... I remember going shopping at the Reading Market, the neighborhoods with lights, and yummy food, of course. So you remember the most important thing. Yeah. Ah, here's what I came for. Can I get some of your Bark, please? Thanks. I heard you like Peppermint Bark? And they are known for theirs. Thanks. Oh! That tiny train set... will look great in Brooke's Christmas diorama. I'll take one of those. Thank you. She'll love it. What about you? You don't want anything special for Christmas? Well if you could believe it, I wished for an easy-bake oven one year. Really? Was it broken or... Turns out I didn't have much use for it. Kind of like you and a cookbook? TouchÃ©. Oh... I always wanted a chandelier in my imaginary house. "Imaginary house"? When I was a kid, I had a vision of the perfect house. I sketched it out and everything. I even drew a Santa on top of the roof 'cause I was worried that when we moved, he wouldn't find us. But my mom always said, wherever we were, if I hung my stocking, Santa would find me. And he always did. What's that about? Just checking on my Christmas planning. Let's get out of here. It's getting a bit cold. Okay. Uh... what is going on here? Hi, Taylor. I'm Jenny, Adam's little sister. Hi. Nice to meet you. Um, what are you guys doing here? Oh, just delivering Brooke to her dad. Nice Christmas tree... What is everyone smiling about? Follow me, Taylor. Ta-dah! What in the world... I told you, your house needed decorating. But... And we had tons of leftover decorations. And the tree is for you! You didn't have to. Sure, we did. Adam, can you please help me get the tree off my car? You have fun, kids. I'm heading out to a Christmas party. It looks perfect right here. Ready? These are pretty. Oh, yes, you do. - Okay, and do you want one? - Yes. Okay, you're going to have a good-looking tree. All right... I knew they were down there somewhere. Okay... It's beautiful. It's hand-blown crystal from Prague. My parents, they lived there for two years. They have an amazing Christmas market in the old town square, with giant trees and vendors. Just people and music, and lots and lots of Christmas. Dad, look at this one! It's beautiful. Go ahead, put it on the tree! Thank you so much for everything. Oh, and Adam? I wasn't entirely truthful when I said I was missing traditional Christmas at home, 'cause all of this... It's pretty amazing. Let's grab our coats, honey. Careful, a sugarplum dropped from that height could put someone in a sugar coma. Good point. I'll be careful. Royal icing works like glue. How come they call it "Royal" icing? Did a king invent it? Not exactly, but when the bakers were making Queen Victoria's wedding cake, they used icing and confectioners' sugar. That's when they found out how strong this stuff really is. All right, guys, we've got to pick up the pace so we can start decorating. Hey, Taylor? Never thought I'd be doing something like this back in architecture school. Well, that makes two of us. And just like in architecture school, we're still competing. Well, may the best team win. So, while the gingerbread panels settle for the frame, there's two things we need before we start decorating. What? Inspiration... and Brooke. Amazing, huh? The perfect neighborhood to get ideas for decorations. All these lights. Well, what do you see that you like? Window boxes! Oh! Me too! So maybe we give the gingerbread house window boxes, but with candycanes instead of flowers? And for lights, we string together colored lollipops! You are a natural. So, how about inside the house? A gingerbread house inside of a gingerbread house! And a welcome mat. "Home, Very Sweet Home." Perfect. So who does all this? The people that live on this street. It's been going on years. Every Christmas, it's more and more spectacular. Families move out, new families move in, but the tradition carries on. How do you know all this? He knows because the house he grew up in is just three blocks away. Oh! A fireplace would be great. I've always wanted a home with one... A fireplace? Well, how would we make flames out of candy? I'm not sure. But we do need to make a candy run for more decorations, so we will try and find out. Red licorice doesn't look like flames. Maybe orange slices? Getting warmer, though. I've got it! Glass candy can look like flames for the fireplace! That's brilliant. With reds, yellow, orange... Let's get a case of it. Oh, and should get loads of the gumdrops for decorating. How can I help you? We'll take all the orange and red glass candy you've got. And can I get some gumdrops, too. Sure. How many would you like? Maybe 5,000? No, 10,000! You sure about that, young lady? Yeah, she's sure. She's the Chief Decorating Officer after all. Well, all right then. Okay, guys, you can start bringing out the gingerbread. Whoa, that's a lot of icing. Well, we've got a lot of gingerbread. Good morning! Just stopping by with treats for this hard-working team. And I just thought I would check in and see how things are going with the project. Excellent. The gingerbread's baked and will be up by the end of the day. Oh... and ahead of the competition from the looks of it. Good work, Taylor. Uh-oh. Uh-oh? It's cracking. No! That's what I worried about... These thin sheets of gingerbread are too fragile. And I told you, the thin sheets are what work best with my design, remember? And remember when I told you if it was too thin, they could crack? Well, it looks like we've got a problem. You better figure that out. Because the clock is ticking Not much time until Christmas Eve. But I know you're up to the task. I think we need to bake the gingerbread thicker. More like bricks. Look, I know you warned me about this, but big bricks won't work with my design. Well, Taylor, maybe your design needs to change? We have to build on what we've done, not start over from scratch. You know, my sister has Brooke for the whole day... so we have some time. My Mom always taught me if you can't solve a problem, you go and do something else, 'cause that's when you figure it out. Do you know how much work we have to do? Come on. Okay. Seriously? You've never skated? Let's just say it's been a couple of decades. If I'm trying to forget about cracking gingerbread, the last thing that I should be doing is skating on thin ice. It's not thin. It's normal ice. And I should trust you on this? Okay. Fine. Fine. Let's do it. You want to push off with each foot... Let's go. Come on. - I don't know. - You've got this. This might be a bit too advanced for me. How are you so good? We had a skating rink in our backyard as a kid, and every winter, we'd lay out the 4x4 and the liner, and turn the hose on. The next morning, bingo, mini skating rink. - Although... - Although what? One winter, I left the hose on. Oh, no! Your poor parents. My Mom took it in stride, but she invited all the kids in the neighborhood down to winter wonderland. She even made gingerbread cookies. Aw. Your mom sounds like a lot of fun. So I'm going to let go. You're going to be okay. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. I don't think I'm ready. So... why are you doing it? What? Skating. Look! Oh, my gosh, I'm doing it. And don't think about it too much. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. So did the skating make you come up with any new ideas? I'm still stumped about my design, but this was fun. And I forgot about our problems for a while. I know your boss wants you to come up with this cutting-edge idea, but maybe the new cutting-edge could be tradition? Hmm... Hey, Josephine. Hi, Taylor. Any new ideas? I am so stressed out. But I thought things were going great. Well, I'm not so sure the modern design is the way to go. Time is running out, and now we're back to the drawing board. I'm afraid Linda won't be happy. You'll figure it out. You're you! Thank you, Jos'. I'll see you tomorrow? Bye. And it won't take a lot of work to re-design the frame. All we need to do is change up the roof, add the flower boxes, and go with bricks. What do you think? I like it. How did you come up with the design? Actually, I dug up a sketch I drew when I was little. Kind of went from there. Call it an inspiration. I love it. But... I thought you wanted something cutting-edge. Well, it won't be the design Linda asked for, but she will be cheering the loudest when we win. Well, we'd better get to work. All right, I will get this rolled out, and cut it into bricks. She caught on to baking pretty quick. And how are things going outside of the kitchen? Well, we had a big setback, but we have a new plan for the house... I wasn't talking about the gingerbread house. I mean, how are things going with Taylor? Okay, yeah. We can put it up a little more. Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. Right there. What are they doing? Looks good. What number should it be? What's the number of the house you grew up in? 27. Then that's the address. Cool. All right, we may have lost a day, but we are almost on track. Tomorrow, we're going to have to pick up the pace. Brooke, honey, it's time to go. We're gonna give Taylor a lift home. And there's something we want to show you on the way. Okay. We're almost there. Oh, my goodness. - Okay... - Okay? Open! What is this? It's a landing strip for Santa's reindeer and sleigh! It's the city's way of making sure that, even if there's a blizzard, Santa can find us. And it always works. I've even seen a reindeer's print in the snow when we come here on Christmas Day! Is that so? Come on, I'll show you where you can leave a snack for the reindeer in case they get hungry. Okay. So, what do you think? I think it's pretty amazing. Adam... I just want to thank you. For what? For the first time in a while... I feel like I'm home for Christmas. I'm glad. It's beautiful. Thanks for the ride. Tomorrow's December 20th. Just three days left to decorate. We'll be ready! Hello? Sorry for calling so late, Taylor. Oh, no, that's fine. Is everything okay? More than okay. Listen, I appreciate how you've taken the reins with the competition. Thank you. Clearly, you've held up your end of our little deal, so... I have an early Christmas present for you. Can you say "Joyeux Noel"? What do you mean? Well, I had dinner with a few of our board members tonight, and, you know, they'll make a formal decision later, but you're the front runner for Paris... Which means you'll be heading out on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve? I know you don't have plans for Christmas, so I made some for you! A chance to celebrate Christmas in the City of Lights. Oh, and I even got you an invite for a Christmas party at the Minister of Culture's chateau. Oh... Um... that's so soon. I thought you'd be more excited. I mean, isn't this what you were pushing for? Of course. Of course. Thank you so much. I can't wait. Let me know what the board decides. Okay. Bye, Taylor. Just a little more decorating. Where did everyone go? You must have really been in the zone. I let the rest of the team go. Holidays and such, and they were tired. Well, I don't blame them. I'm kind of tired, too. So... have a seat. Okay. Thank you. Look at us. Just a couple of folks, sitting on our stoop, watching the world go by. Nice little place we got here. Our own little chalet. You know, I have to admit, the traditional roof is nice. We do have some serious competition from our neighbors, who built quite the skyscraper. Winning would be the icing on the cake, but I only entered this crazy competition to show Brooke her Dad can dream big. And why just dreaming? And not make your bakery dream a reality? Ask the investors who turned me down. Well, you didn't have your glorious gingerbread win under your belt then! Well, fingers crossed. You know, this... this takes me back. Sitting at the front of the house, with the family, a little music playing... I have an idea. Do you think we could use music for our gingerbread house? That's a great idea. I mean, we already have four of the five senses. Mm-hmm. Sight, smell... taste, touch... and hearing... also, that would be great. How about a doorbell that plays music? Or isn't that traditional enough for you? I'll allow it. What kind of music? Um, a carol maybe? Something up-tempo. This one? It's a good song to dance to. Here, let me show you. Huh? What? You can't dance? Oh, I can dance, all right. What's going on over here? Just working on our house. This place yours? Yep, all of it. Wait until you see it finished. Looks good... but you can't really be here right now. I've got this place on lockdown like Fort Knox. Anything happens to these houses, it's on me. We're about to head out, but do you want a taste? I'm on duty. Though... I suppose a nibble wouldn't hurt. Baked fresh this morning. Not bad. Not bad at all. Well, carry on. Merry Christmas. So ends our dancing. Okay, we have a big day tomorrow. Our fireplace looks amazing! Glass candy flames... Who'd have thought it? Our Chief Decorating Officer, that's who. So, how does dusting the windows with icing sugar and grated coconut sound? To give it that morning frost look? I love a morning frost. Or a fresh snowfall. Can we do that? Yeah. Of course. There's just one more thing... Here's a little project I've been working on... A candy chandelier? All in your spare time? Adam, it's wonderful. And I have one more idea! We need pictures on the walls. Of a family! Good point. It is a home, after all. It needs that lived-in look. We could always put up some pictures up on the mantle. Why don't we take a photo of the three of us? Um... sure. Come on. Taylor, get in a little closer. I love how this place is coming together. It does prove that anything is possible. Like you and I working as a team. So, what happens if you win anyway? Linda give you a big corner office? Kind of. Actually, I've been meaning to mention something. If all goes off well, I might have some news of my own... Bonsoir. Oh, Annabelle. Hi. Yes, hello. Look, I just wanted to say... I'm impressed. I've been watching you two. You had an enormous setback, but you really bounced back. Your gingerbread house is actually quite good. I'm glad you like it. But it's mostly thanks to our baker here. Well, if there's anything I can appreciate, it's talent and hard work. Allez, bonne chance. A kind word from Annabelle. Did I hear that right? A Christmas miracle. By the way, what is it you wanted to tell me? Nothing important. Let the last day of decorating begin! It's the final stretch for teams here, at the Giant Gingerbread Competition. Only a few minutes left! We literally have nothing left to decorate. I'd say we're done here. I saw one of the other houses has a name. So what's the name of our house? Good question. Maybe something with "home" in it? I saw you hang your stocking on the mantle. I thought it was pretty fitting. We've got something else for the mantle. I love it. That's perfect. I'll go put it inside. Traditional. Bold and new. Maybe I need to try something bold and new myself. Maybe another try at your own bakery? I was thinking the same thing. In fact, I invited some of the investors to the judging, so thanks for the push. My pleasure. Taylor, I know you can't be with your Mom and Dad this Christmas, but, if you wanted, Brooke and I... we're hoping you'd spend Christmas with us? That's the best invitation I've ever gotten. Well, everyone needs a place for the holidays. That's it! What? The name of the house. "A Home for the Holidays." It's perfect. Hey. I just had to come and see it for myself. That... is not the plan we discussed. But I love it! Great job. Oh, and, Taylor, I'm going to be sorry to see you go, but the board met, and it's official. You're on your way! Au revoir. What does she mean? Adam, I was going to tell you... Tell me what? We need to talk. The judging for the Giant Gingerbread Competition will take place tomorrow at noon. Wow. Paris. Pretty hard to compete with that. Well, it's a dream job I've wanted for years. I thought I'd have more time to decide. So, I guess you won't be joining us for Christmas this year. Adam, believe me, I want to spend Christmas with you and Brooke, it's just... Hey, don't worry. I'll explain it to Brooke. After all, Santa's got a lot of places to visit this year, right? Sweetheart. My friend, Diana, emailed that she saw a news report about you and some giant gingerbread house? Well, you know the expression "truth is stranger than fiction"? That's pretty much the case here. Diana also mentioned something about you working pretty closely with a handsome young man? That's Adam. He's the baker doing the project with me. He's nice... Nice, huh? I can see you blushing. It's just... It's just, I don't know, Mom. What's wrong, honey? I got offered the job in Paris. That's great, isn't it? Yes. It's just... Philadelphia has been... growing on me. There's so much feeling of Christmas here. It's kind of starting to feel like... Like home? Home is wherever you hang your Christmas stocking. You'll know in your heart when you've found the right place... Or the right person. Thanks, Mom. I love you. I'll call you and Dad tomorrow on Christmas Day. Looking forward to it. Love you. My kids have been asking me every day for the past week when this day would come. Well, I promise we won't disappoint. - Hey. - Hey. About yesterday, I'm sorry I didn't mention... Don't worry about it. I'm happy for you. Happy Holidays, everybody! And welcome to the judging of our first ever Giant Gingerbread House Competition! Could I please have our teams approach the stage? Come on up. Now, it's the moment we've all been waiting for. May I present our first gingerbread house, Snowman Sanctuary... Our second entry... the Elf Castle! Next, we have... The Northern Tower! Theirs is really tall. My goodness, that could go in a museum someplace, am I right? And now, may I present, our final gingerbread house, A Home for the Holidays! Three, two, one... I told you I love a fresh snowfall. Well, to say all of our entries exceeded expectations would be an understatement, but this is a contest, so, unfortunately, we have to pick a winner. Judges, your results, please. And the winner of our first Giant Gingerbread Contest is... A Home for the Holidays! Taylor, we won! Congratulations, Ray's Bakery! Congratulations! You did it. We did it. And I bet your investors are pretty impressed. Where are they? Actually... they weren't able to make it. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't be. It doesn't matter! What matters is we won! Congratulations. Yeah, that was really something. Thank you. I mean, your house is spectacular. Yeah, we're pretty proud of it. Adam. Your flare for design is quite exceptional. Thank you, and you're impressive as always. You know, I am looking for a new assistant. Thank you, Annabelle, but I already have a job. Fine. But if you ever do open your own place, please, do invite me to the opening. Bon, alors, bonne soirÃ©e. Great job. So... when are you leaving? I fly out tonight. Thank you for believing in me. I'm glad we made it happen. Me too. Are you really leaving? On Christmas Eve? Oh, sweetie... I have to. But I had a great time. Bye, Taylor. Bye, Brooke. Merry Christmas... Merry Christmas. Are you kidding, it's the least I can do. Well, the movers said they'd come the day after Christmas. Most everything is already boxed up. If you could just give them the keys. Consider it done. We'll miss you, but Paris for Christmas... I guess you'll be calling the City of Lights your new home. Yes... Home. That must be your shuttle. Merry Christmas. Have a good flight. Thank you. Christmas is tomorrow. Think I could order a gingerbread house? I'm afraid I just don't have time. I'm so sorry. Will you take a bell cake, as a Christmas present? You're a lifesaver, Adam. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Well, that's another one. You're turning away customers, Adam. We're behind on gingersnaps, the sugar cookies are running low, and... Adam, slow down. I can get help for all that. We're a neighborhood bakery, selling to people what they expect. Now, all of the sudden, we have people coming in here every five minutes, asking for your cakes. There's lines outside the door. Ray, is this a roundabout way of saying you're firing me? Firing you? I'm talking about making you a partner. - Are you serious? - Yes. We have people banging down our doors to get to your cakes. Now, I know you've always wanted to open your own bakery, so why not open it right in here? I don't follow. I'm talking about your own display case, your name out front. What do you say, partner? It sounds pretty good to me. Well, we got that taken care of. Wait till Brooke hears about this. And Taylor... what about her? You know, ever since you found out she was leaving, you haven't smiled much. So why don't you go tell her how you feel and let her decide if she wants to leave or not. Ray... I don't want to stop Taylor from living her life. All I'm saying is Taylor's the one who walked in here and asked you to partner up. She came to you, cap in hand. Now, maybe it's your turn to do the same? Is it that obvious how I feel? Please. I can tell you don't want Taylor to go. So tell her. And what if she leaves anyway? Well, then she leaves. At least she'll know how you feel. Thanks, Ray. Thank goodness. I thought I missed... Wendy? Is Taylor here? Sorry, Adam. I was just boxing up some of her things. She was in a hurry. She left for the airport a couple hours ago. Her flight's taking off any minute. This is a pre-boarding call for flight 714 bound for Paris. At this time, anyone requiring assistance or traveling with small children, please check in. Excuse me, but a family that just boarded forgot this. I'll make sure they get it. Linda? This is Taylor. We need to talk. Look, Dad, new skates! Santa even remembered I was wishing for pink skate guards. Santa doesn't usually drop the ball. It's just too bad Taylor's not here. We could have all gone skating together. That's okay. You and I will. But first, we've got to check out Santa's landing, so go get dressed and grab your coat. I left it upstairs. I'll be right back. - Taylor? - Hi. What are you doing here? I'm sorry... I hope I'm not interrupting anything. I thought you'd left. Come in. Well, I was on my way last night, but then I realized I forgot something. What did you forget? I have been traveling so long, I forgot what home felt like. And since I found it this week... why would I want to leave? But what about your job? My firm got the downtown redevelopment project. The Mayor confirmed it. Which means Linda will be needing someone to head it up. It'll be the biggest job I've ever done. But what about Paris? Your dream? I've got everything I've ever dreamed of right here. So you're staying? I am. Great! Then you can come to my grand opening. Or "re-opening," I should say. Excuse me? "Ray's Bakery" is having a grand re-opening... As "Ray and Adam's Bakery". I'll be handling the speciality pastries only. It wouldn't have happened with you. Are you kidding? Adam, that's great! This calls for a celebration! Then you'd better get your skates, because in this house, every Christmas Day after we go to Santa's Landing, we hit the ice. But before we go this year... I think there's another tradition we should start. And what's that? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Dad, who are you talking to? Taylor, you're here? Yes, I'm here. And I couldn't be happier. Now... How about we go check out those new skates I see under the tree? Look, Taylor. Oh... Merry Christmas.
