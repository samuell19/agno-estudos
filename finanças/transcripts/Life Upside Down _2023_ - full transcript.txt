Oh, they hung it right here. So this is the one. Yes, this is the one that I wanted to show you. - Yeah. - You like it, the colors? - Yeah, it's good. - It's like winter, the... - Psychedelic. - Yeah. Kind of like a summer/winter-type thing. - Really? - Okay. Hey, Jonathan. This is fantastic. - Oh, thank you so much. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Yeah. Oh, hey, Clarissa. Jonathan. - Hi. Congratulations. - Hi. Hi. Thank you. You know, Clarissa helped with the show. She did research, you know, when she wasn't teaching. - Yes. - It wasn't easy, because Jonathan is a perfectionist. That's why I buy his paintings. Yeah. - Oh, George, yeah. - Yeah, the whole show - is just really great. - Thank you so much. Yeah. - Really impressive stuff. - George. Can I ask you about... Hey, Paul, you see something you like? - Yeah, I like this. - The political piece. - Is it? - Yeah. I mean, no. I mean, if you think it is, yeah. You like it? Is it sold? I see a red dot. Oh, yeah, no, red dots, they come right off. You know, I can do that, if you like it. I'll check out the rest of the show. Alright. Hey, Paul... So we can next week, yes. - Your friend Paul... so great. - I know. He's so loaded. I know. So? They're looking at the Berg painting. That's the one I told you about. Oh, no. The Berg painting? The pointillist pastiche. I don't love it. Do you? No, but other people do. People like Paul... with money. Go. - Do you like it? - I love it. - Why? - It reminds me of candy. Candy? I know nothing about art, but it's supposed to emote, and this reminds me of childhood. This one here is elegant. I think it is truly beautiful. Yeah, I'm looking at something far more objectively beautiful. I don't say this often, but I think you saved me. I mean, before we met, I was so depressed. That first time we made love, you brought me back to life. I can't get enough of you. He's really just... he works tirelessly on this gallery. Yes, he does. We hardly ever see him at home. Well, he's got to put the work in to get the work back, right? - Yeah, I guess so. - Wow. I don't think that's a Faulkner, though, is it? No, that is definitely not a Faulkner. Okay. Sometimes I get them mixed up a little bit. Would you... Would you like some wine? I would love some wine. - White. - White. Okay. - Dry. - Chardonnay or... - Just anything dry. - Alright. Also, they've got some strawberries, too. No, I'm going to pass on the strawberries. Okay. Oh. Sue, honey, you said you weren't coming tonight. Well, the floor workers finished early, so... By the way, I have these wood samples - that I need you to look at. - Wood samples? Can we talk about something else at my art-gallery opening? - Like what? - Like art? I don't know. Excuse me. Here you go. Mr. Wigglesworth, this is a great show tonight. Thank you, James. Thank you. We will talk about the books on Monday. Yeah, I wanted to tell you that we really should actually talk. - We really should. - Yeah. Don't worry. I'm going to sell everything. Ah, oh shit. What was it I said a teacher should say to their students when they don't know the answer? - A teacher. What should... - Oh, yes. "Be that as it may." "Be that... Be that as it may." Still use it with my political science students today. Hey. - Hey. - What a surprise. She went out to get groceries, so... Yeah? What did you tell her this time? I told her I was on a business call for the next hour. I like it when you lie to her for me. It makes me feel so important. I can lie to you, too, if it gets you off. Never, ever lie to me, or I'll cut your balls off. What are you there, putting camouflage on? Oh, I thought it was hand sanit... I mean, moisturizer. Oh, my gosh. Shit. You know what? I'm losing my goddamn mind here. Seriously, I miss you. I miss you. Where the fuck are you? I know. Me, too. I mean, I'm stuck here with her. She drives me nuts. You know what? I think she likes it. You know, she's, like, so copacetic and easy. I'm sorry. Can we just not talk about her for, like, a minute? Easy, easy. You know, we haven't had sex in three years, so we're like strangers. Okay, well, there's nothing, I guess, for me to be jealous of, so that's good. Absolutely. Speaking of sex... I'm feeling very horny. Well, that's why I called you. I love being this close to you. I really miss having sex. Do you want to do it? Yeah. We got an hour. Alright. Remember that one time at the gallery? I had that chocolate sauce from the cart, and I put it on your mouth and I put it on... Where'd you put it, the chocolate sauce? Then I licked it off, and I loved it. - Oh, yeah. - You're so sexy. Yeah. Well, we can add strawberry and whipped cream. What else do you like? Oh, let's talk about the black leather gloves. Black leather gloves? Oh, I love black leather gloves. Yeah. Secret lover. Oh, God, yeah. Oh, I love this. Oh, I love this. What else is on the list? What list, hon? It's Erica at the gallery, and she's telling me about the list of paintings that are sitting there and we can't sell. Oh, okay. Catch you with the strawberry cream, babe. Hey, Trexa, play the news. COVID-19 is leaving schools and businesses empty, has isolated many from friends and loved ones, as the country and the world face a pandemic of a "once in a lifetime" scale. Dr. Sanders, please give us your take on all of this. Good morning. And I stand on the corner of Wilshire and Westwood Boulevard, normally one of the busiest intersections... Vegan cookies. My favorites. Mmm. Oh, yum. Yum, yum, yum. There are still more questions than answers to this strange pandemic, and we promise to keep you updated as they become available. Mmm. Delicious. See? Love can exist. Love has legs. Love can endure. Goddamn! Why have you got to always put everything up on top of the refrigerator, and they fall on my head? It's like you're trying to kill me. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. There you go. There you go. All safe. Yes, there's shortages like I've never seen before, not in our lifetime. I've heard everything from frozen vegetables to computer chips, bicycles, baby formula, video-game consoles, if you want something while you're stuck at home. And, of course, the old toilet-paper rush. Are most restaurants shut down? You know, pretty much in our city... In our city, all the restaurants have shifted to takeout or delivery, and it's really depriva... Playing rainstorm for relaxation. It helps to have this on. Cheers. Mmm. Mmm. Do you like it? Yes. I wonder when I'll be able to continue my nutrition training. One of those simple questions one cannot give an answer to at this particular moment. - Hey. - Hi. Hi. Bit late for you, isn't it? Yeah, well, I'm lucky I have friends that work late. Oh, what's the matter? It just occurred to me today that this whole situation could go on for a very long time and I am stuck here alone and Jonathan is over there with his wife. Look, Jonathan is married. What difference would it make anyway? You wouldn't be able to see him anyway. Yes, he's married, but he's not in love with his wife. Do you believe that? Come on. Come on. You're smarter than that. Well, you might understand. Intellect does not always align with the heart. And when I met Jonathan, he told me he was in an open relationship, which was a little weird. But turns out he opened it without telling his wife. Well, I think you should find a better situation for yourself, one that's based on loyalty and mutual trust, love, you know, and constant physical contact. Like mine with Rita. I mean, she's... She's of course, different. Different? Well, that's an understatement. Well, be that as it may... I personally love this strange moment this forced domesticity. I think he would leave her, except for the fact that they have two kids, he can't really afford a divorce, and she suffers from chronic asthma. I know what this sounds like. I sound like a terrible person. I feel like a terrible person. I feel very, very guilty. But right now, I feel ferociously jealous. It's like double jeopardy, you know? I'm just... Well, what can I say? Stay safe and sane. Okay. Good night. Bye. Clean-up reactivated. Oh. Is the fridge working? How's your family doing in Europe? I hear it's a mess there. Hey, Trexa Between if and when to wear the mask, how to greet friends, or whether you should see friends at all, there's a lot unknown about COVID-19, and since coronavirus isn't going away anytime soon, I wanted to learn how to navigate these potentially awkward social interactions. I caught up with Bloomberg's Annie Valentine to ask her all about COVID-19. This is how we make pasta in Italy, and, guys, this is the best pasta recipe ever. This machine is so cool. Can you turn that TV down? Honey, I'm going to start making pasta. Well, because that is the definition of a strategic situation. Now, we are in a strategic situation where what I want is different from what you want. We have differences in goals, and we can't independently control our... Professor, are their main strategies adopted? All we need to know is that game theory will help us disentangle a situation of this kind to avoid infinite regress. I can see that you are all shuffling your papers. I take that as a cue I've run over time. Okay, well, I look forward to seeing you all on Monday, and please don't forget your assignments. See you soon. Hey, why is it so messy in here? I brought you a snack. Stop bringing me cookies. Alright? I'm trying to lose weight, not gain. I'm going back to work, you know. I don't want to be fat. Fuck. The ability to get what you want from others. You can do it in three ways. You can do it with coercion. - Hey, babe. - Hi. I'm going to go lie down, watch some MMA women. MMA? Mixed martial arts. O-K-A-Y. Maybe you should watch some, you know, History Channel or... Why? Why do you always want me to do something different? You always want to improve me. Oh, no, no. I love you. I love you just the way you are. I'm not sure about the latter, but how's the chapter coming along? Oh, good, good. Do you like this? "Only the dead have seen the end of war." It's very poetic. I don't know about poetic. - Where did it come from? - From here. - Oh. - Yeah. No, it's... it's Plato. Plato? Plato. Plato. Sweet. All I care about is my gallery, okay, keeping it open. If it goes down, I'm going to take a lot of people with me. If it closes... Okay, well, let's talk about that. - What? - Are you okay? What is going on? You know, since when do I have to tell you everything that's happening? You are really stressed. I'm sorry. No worries. Let's continue tomorrow. I'm going out to get something for the twins. Wear your mask and your gloves, okay? - You're high-risk. - I know. Hello? Hey, Paul, it's me, Jonathan. Hey, how's it going? Oh, great. You? Well, if I had two-mill cash and a couple of Tahitian girls massaging me, I'd be great. That's funny. Thought it was kind of demented, but... no pressure here. Are you considering that Berg painting? Well, I'm not sure. Rita loves it. But could you hold on to it for a few days for us? Yeah, yeah, we can... We can hold it. Thanks. Nate and Julie are in Paris. It's terrible. I'm just planting vegetables. Seriously, the basic economy. I am so freaked out. Oui oui. I'm just... I'm so glad I have my Buddhist meditation practice. Every day at 7:00, I'm sitting down and meditating with Gowenka and a bunch of other meditators. Okay, that's good, now. That's fantastic. Yeah, I'm surrendering to my yoga practice. - Oh, ow! Oh, shit. - Clarissa, what happened? You've fallen? Oh, my God. Keep on walking. - Keep on walking. - Keep on walking? Walking? - That's it. - Okay. I'm walking. What is it you want in the depth of your ignorance? That's offensive. Well, I have to defend my point with all my might. To erase one paragraph? Yes. Yes. I think that's utterly idiotic. - Really? - Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but it's just plain stupid. - Come on. - Look, if you want the book to be this way or that way, then why don't you just write it yourselves? Darling. Darling, please come here. - Let me admire your beauty. - Hey. - Yes. - Oh. I feel your warmth. - Professor Hasselberg. - Sorry. Dr. Camden from Heaven Meadows. Your mother isn't doing well. What do you mean she's not doing well? - She has a high fever... - What does that mean? And difficulty breathing. Okay, I'll be right over. No, I'm sorry, but we can't have visitors right now. This is a special case. We have to be very strict. That's just stupid, isn't it? We shall keep you informed. Will you be home? Is that a joke? I understand how difficult this is. Call me as soon as you know something. Absolutely. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Goodbye. What is it? What happened? Mother is sick. They don't know what it is, but they say that she's having problems breathing. I'm very concerned. It's not their mother. Why should they care? I'm not sure about this stupid Heaven Meadows place. I want her out of there. Is it okay if she comes to live with us, baby? What? Your mom here with us? Yes. Sure. Oh, great. Thank you. - You're the best. - Mm-hmm. I'm going to go for my run. There's nothing happening. We have paintings that are supposed to be on consignment, but nobody is buying anything right now. I'm supposed to help you with your business, help take care of the records. Financially, It's not looking good. We need to change something, and we need to do it fast. I have one big sale that's still outstanding. I mean, I don't know if it's going to come through. That would be great. But, listen to me, please. Nothing is happening. There are no new sales. People are staying in their homes because they have to. There's no new money coming in, and we have to figure out a way to take care of this financially. Yeah, you know, I know it's a very stressful time and I know you care. We just need to know when we're going to get paid. Are we losing our jobs? You're all going to get paid. You can't do that, Mr. Wigglesworth. How would you like it if I didn't pay you? These people, they just left college, most of them. They got nothing. - Hello? - Well, what's wrong, handsome? I'm under a Damocles sword here, and it's coming down fast. Is there anything I can do to help? A blowjob? Mr. Marlowe, if you would please allow me to resume my Zoom call with the employees. Thank you. Oh, shit. Hey. Where are you? I'm in the garage. Sorry about earlier. Oh, okay, great. Why don't you FaceTime me? I've got a little surprise for you. Are you naked? Yeah. I am sorry. How are you doing? You sound a little bit stressed out. Yeah. I think I'm going to lose the gallery. Oh, my God. If I lose it, I don't know what I'm... Oh, my God. Okay, thanks. None of that is going to sell any paintings. Hey, maybe I could come by, like, around 4:00, and just see you from a distance. I want to comfort you, too. Hello? I'm sorry. I didn't hear the last part. I was saying, can I come by? Just... I'll just see you from outside the window. Yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes. That would be totally awesome. I'll be right here. Around 4:00 or so. I'll just... I'll just park outside and just wave to you. Of course. Yes. Jonathan? - Yeah. Coming. - Did you find it? I told her I was getting something for the pool. Jonathan. Hey, show me your tits. Are you kidding? There's a guy outside circulating around. It's creeping me out. Show me one tit? It's half the risk. - Jonathan. - Yeah, coming. Alright, I'll see you at 4:00. I'm going to honk. For your first lesson, We're talking about how to generate more speed with less effort. So a great drill that I show players to get the hang of this is I get them to set up. - Hello? - Hey. - I'm back. - Hi. Well, that was a long run. Same as always. Yeah, that plus 38 minutes. Oh, well, I'm here now. Look, I'm sorry. I don't mean to nag. I'm going to make some skewers for dinner. Oh, really? What, lamb and beef? No, no caveman food. Tofu. Oh, tofu. Again. Darling, would you check this out for me? I was just toying with this idea for my book, right? Listen to this. "Two things are infinite... The universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the universe." Einstein. I'd like to start my book from that very thought and apply it to political analysis, because stupidity is such a great threat to humanity, it's a threat to the world, and it's underestimated, the dangerous stupidity of those in power. What do you think? I think it's wonderful. Whose idea was it? Frankenstein's? Darling, could you just put that down a little bit? Hey. What do you think of this bread? I made it with no yeast. It's a little concave. - Yes. Yes. - We know it's delicious. So it's minimal ingredients, mainly store-bought. - Hey. - Hey. - How was the gallery? - Empty, dusty, and depressing. I made some fresh pasta. You going to taste it? I'm not hungry. Mr. Marlowe, I'm sorry. I couldn't come by. I got very busy at the gallery. I'll drop your artwork off later. I mean, really? I've been sitting here for two hours. You couldn't let me know a little earlier? I figure, you know, you'll still be where you are right now. - No one's going anywhere. - Yeah. Well, that's gracious. Mr. Marlowe, thanks for checking in, and I'll see you a little later when I can. Many states, including Florida, Texas, and Georgia, are fighting back today against federal mandates imposing the wearing of masks and social distancing, claiming that these rules are unconstitutional. That's just so stupid. - Where are you going? - I don't know. What is the logical basis, evidence, for you saying the U.N. is useless? In what context? Okay, so a country like the United States is able to take advantage of smaller countries by destabilizing economies, undermining governments, and selling arms to countries that will inevitably disrupt harmony and union, but the U.N. does nothing to stop this, - then one of the things... - Look, I'm sorry, Arthur, I didn't mean to cut you off, but you're taking up a lot of space right now, and I'd like to hear from some of the other students in this class. We can talk about your opinions later in-depth after class. - If I may say... - I'm sorry. Catherine. Since its inception, the United Nations has performed numerous humanitarian, environmental, and peacekeeping undertakings, providing food to 90 million people in over 75 countries, supporting racial issues. I'm sorry. It's our dean calling with an emergency. I'll be right back. I am down. I am, like, abyss-like down. I just... I just need some encouragement. I'm in the middle of my class. I'm still mad about yesterday. Okay, you're the kind of person that can just do whatever you put your mind to. You are practically a genius. But, most importantly, I really care about you. I got to go now. Bye. Catherine, you were saying that the United Nations is an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace and security, harmonizing the actions of nations. That's bullshit, and you know it. Stop teaching us bullshit. Yeah, yeah, I understand. And I'll keep an eye out for any paintings of chickens. Yeah. Chicken. Keyword. Yeah, thanks. Bye. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Hi, Jonathan. How are you? Hi, Paul. Listen, I'm calling you because, you know, the Berg painting, the one that Rita loves? I'll be willing to give you a pandemic discount. Well, I think we should hang on to the cash that we have right now. So should you, my friend. You're a smart man. You're wonderful friend Paul is not coming through on anything. He's totally out. Oh, well, he is wonderful because he introduced us. You know what's coming up, cupcake? Bankruptcy. Homelessness. I wish I had a bigger car to live in. No, it's my birthday. - Parts. - Fridge parts. Oh, finally. I know. Yeah. Next week, right? You're 45. No, it's my 40th, and it's tomorrow. You don't have to add five years. I was just teasing you. I remember. And I got you something. Yep, you're going to love it. What am I going to love? You'll see. It's a surprise. You know what would be a really nice surprise is if you can show up for my Zoom birthday party tomorrow. Paul's going to be there. Tony's going to be there. I understand you're probably having dinner with the family, but if you could just slip out for five minutes... That would be dangerous and exciting. I would love it. Hello? - Hello? - Hello? Hello? Hello? What's up? So, I heard it's your "B" day tomorrow. Well, I think we should celebrate. You know, I was just going to lay low. Well, think about it. - Okay. - Okay. - Alright, thanks. - Bye. Okay, let me know about the fridge. - Sure. Thank you. - Okay. Bye. Listen to them clap, Rita. Clapping for the nurses and the first responders. Hey, listen, I was thinking we may be able to sell that Berg painting to Waterman. You know, that rich friend of my dad's? I don't mind. I can call him. You'd do that for me? Of course I would. Who's texting you at this hour? It's an artist, Barry Marlowe. He's kind of a pain in the ass. He says he loves me, but I think he wants something from me. You never asked me for anything, have you? That you stay healthy. I'm sorry, babe. I'm so tired tonight. I can't. Oh, it's... it's fine. We have tomorrow, tomorrow, and tomorrow. And the next day. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. now tops 83,000, more than have been recorded in China or Italy and continue to grow. Over 1,100 people here have died from the coronavirus so far. With vaccines still in development, and no... ready, the CDC and top medical experts say that masks and social distancing are the only way to curb the wave of infections. Whenever we put the clamps down and shut everything down, we do it for two reasons. You're up early. Yeah, I got up at 4:00. - I couldn't sleep. - I know. I can't tell what's paid and what's not paid. See, there's a little "P" on the back. Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday, dear Clarissa Happy Birthday to you Oh, hang on, hang on. Doorbell. Oh, hang on. Gloves. One sec. Coming. Happy birthday to the most vibrant woman that I know. Thank you, Paul. So what's your plan today? I don't know. Jonathan is supposed to be showing some sign of life, but he's not here. Oh. So, you know when you have one of those real assholes for a student? This time he's saying that the U.N. is completely defunct because it doesn't do anything to support its mandate. He's right. He's right. He's absolutely right. International organizations are obsolete in concept and in function. - Okay. - Yeah. So this is your new opinion? Oh, come on. Everything goes back to the very root of all problems, and that is that the majority of the people are just plain stupid. Oh, and, by the way, Rita says, "Happy 40th." Oh, good. So she can count. That's great. Listen to me, please. You hired me to help take care of your money. I'm your accountant. The overall picture's not bright. Money's not coming in. You're two months overdue, as you know, on your rent, and nothing is being sold. So what do are saying? I just have to close down? Exactly. Take advantage of this moment to close everything down permanently. You know, you're lucky. Everybody else... I'm lucky? I should consider myself lucky? James, how about being a little more tactful? We're talking about his life here. - Thank you, Sue. - That's okay, honey. Hello?! What? Sorry. Happy Birthday to me Happy Birthday to me I'm just calling to thank you for this amazing birthday gift. Happy Birthday, Cherry Slush. Yeah, you know, people are taking up hobbies and trying to cook, so I figured you might... Can I just tell you what happened, just spread the pain around a bit? Sure, but when are you coming by? I think that would be torture. I mean, we can't hug, we can't kiss, we can't make love. I can't do that to my wife. She's had asthma her whole life. Blah, blah, blah. But, you know, sometimes I feel sorry for her. I mean, sometimes really sorry for her. Jonathan, every time we speak, it feels like we're just going around and around and around. Yeah, I thought you liked going around with me. Around and around and around and around. Hello. Honey! Listen to this! "Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding." Einstein. Or Frankenstein. "True peace is not just the absence of conflict, but the presence of justice." Honey! "Therefore, wherever you find peace, you find harmony." Honey! Yes. Hello? Speaking. What do you mean she's worse? Well, how much worse? Yes, I know that you do not allow guests. I've been informed of that. Okay. That would be amazing. That's another thing that could be done. Rita? - Hey. - Hey. Hi, hon, I was just asking Harry... - Harry? - If we could use his dumpster tomorrow when the gardener comes. Honey, I just spoke to Heaven Meadows, and they said that they don't think Mom will survive. Anyway, thank you for the birthday flowers, by the way. They're lovely. Right. You're welcome. My friends just told me that his wife had died, and it was a relief. Dad. When you're younger... - Yeah? - Yum, yum, yum. But... Hang on. There's... There's something... - What's going on? - Oh, nothing. - Oh, yes, there is. - No. Hey. Made you some tea. Why don't you try again? Playing always cheers you up. I can't. Tell me something. Is Harry a little lonely after his wife left? Why are you asking me? I have no idea. Well, I think I'm going a little insane, you know? I'm worried about Mom. It's okay. Don't worry. Cheers. Cheers. Hey, Happy Birthday, love. Happy Birthday. So, hey guys, looks like we've got a special guest. Say hi to everyone, Mom. How nice. Thank you. - Cheers. - Thank you. Alright, we're wrapping it up, but I'll give you a call later. Good to see you. - Okay. - Okay. Where is Jonathan? - Hey, where is Jonathan? - Where's Jon? Sometimes nothing is better than something. Be that as it may, it's getting very late, and we should probably wrap it up. But thank you all so much for coming. You really made my day. Night. Wherever you are in the world. - Thank you. Thank you. - Alright, bye, everyone. - Good night, good night. - Bye. Oh, my gosh. - Hi. - Hi. Brought you a cake. - Oh. - I got you this - chocolate, black... - No way. That's so sweet. - That's my favorite. - Chocolate. Yum. Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Oh, yum. - 40, right? - Yeah. - Do you want to come in? - Yes, sure. You haven't been anywhere, have you? No, no. I've been, like, glued to your guesthouse. - Okay, so it's safe. - Yeah. Sure. Your dad's right here. It's Ricky. Hey, kid. How's things in Chicago? Well, it's boring everywhere. Listen, just get yourself a plane ticket and come home right now, whatever it costs. Oh, I just told Margo the same thing. Yeah, I do. Take care, kid. - Hey, honey. - Yes? There's something I want to run by you. You're a great mom. You're just noticing this now? You're funny, too. Are you okay? Do I not seem okay? I've actually always been fascinated by your culture. When I studied the Greek-Persian Wars, I always rooted for you guys. Well, the Persians, they were great empire, one of the greatest. I really thank you. Let's make a toast. May life be safe, peaceful for the entire planet and all its creatures. Salamati. Oh, my God. How did you know that? - Cheers. - Cheers. The World Health Organization remains concerned about the spreading of COVID-19, particularly in the developing countries. Call from Heaven Meadows. Hello? Professor Hasselberg? Yes. Speaking. Dr. Camden from Heaven Meadows. So pleased to let you know that your mother has improved. Oh, that's wonderful news. No more fever, and her breathing is back to normal. Oh, that's just wonderful. That's great. Please keep me in the loop. Of course. Will do. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye now. End of call. The doctors don't have enough equipment, - especially in the rural areas. - Honey, where are those gluten-free muffins? The ones that you buy all the time. - Honey! - Yeah? Honey, I have some great news from Heavenly Meadows. Oh. What's up? - Hi. I've been looking for you. - What? I can't hear you. It's a helicopter. I'm outside. I-I am sorry about yesterday, okay? I-I really miss you. Maybe... Maybe you could make some pasta with that thing I got you. We could have dinner in your garden, you know, like, at a safe distance. Is this your idea of an apology? No, it's not an apology. It's just... It's just a suggestion. - I miss you. - You do? I do. I do. I miss talking to you. I miss having sex with you. I wish we could have sex right now. You know what? I'm not in the mood. And newsflash, I'm not your toy. I know. Listen, Cherry Slush, I got a lot on my mind. I wish you'd cut me some slack. You don't even ask me what I'm thinking anymore. You used to love to hear me ramble on for hours. Why don't you deal with your dog and we can talk about this later. Is everything okay? You sound different. Are you hiding something from me? - No. - Not yet. Not yet. I think I'd better get back in my house. Yeah. It's probably the right thing to do. I'll probably Zoom you tomorrow. Probably. Babe. I almost forgot I am late for my run. Oh, enjoy it. That is a beautiful piece of classical you're playing. It's not classical. It's jazz. I can never get it right with you. Of course you can get it right. You always get it right. You get it right all the time. Whatever. Honey, you dropped something. Listen, the gallery, it's just a space. A space with blank walls. You are the gallery. Everyone knows that. Thank you. Thanks for saying that. All we have to do is pick ourselves back up and keep moving forward. I have seen you reinvent yourself so many times. You have? Yes, of course. Don't beat yourself up. This pandemic has been hard for everyone, not just us. The twins, Margo and Ricky, they love you. I still love you. We've got a good gauge. Just come home. Okay. Most countries have decided to temporarily close educational institutions. However, learning hasn't stopped. Instead, it's now completely taking place online as schools and universities provide remote... This thing's crazy. That's it, like that, and then you can do it. God, I can't even hit it yet. Hang on. They're tangled. They got tangled. Oh, God. That dog. Where are you going? I have to pee. Hey, listen, when this is all over and we can travel again, I'm going to sell that Ed Ruscha drawing that he made for me and take us somewhere special. Really? Where? Polynesia. A remote island in Polynesia. Oh, wow. Yeah, I'd love that. Where did you get that idea? What's fascinating to consider is that the American Constitution has been deeply influenced by the Persian Empire. Yeah. Do you know anything about the Cyrus Cylinder? No, but that's fascinating. It was the first Human Bill of Rights. It's an ancient artifact that Jefferson was fascinated by as well. - Yeah. - I'm proud of you. Yes, proud of you, yes. You don't think it's silly? No, no, it's not silly or stupid at all. Is everything okay over there? I guess I feel strange. I'm not sure what I feel exactly. I just feel very much inside my head. And I feel, like, a paranoia, But I'm... I'm sure it's... it's okay. What do you mean? Paranoid about what? I don't know what it actually is. I don't know. Forget it. Forget it. I just... I just wanted to hear your... Your voice for comfort. Alright. Well, shall we talk tomorrow? - Okay. - Okay. - Alright. - Alright. Good night. Okay. Good night. If I was to grip this club really tight to do this drill, it'd look a lot more this way, and there'd be a lot less speed in that than there will be with the one I'm nice and light. So here's a question. How do you then apply this to your golf swing? Well, there's always a progression that you want to work through. The first thing I'd you have to do is exactly the same drill I've just shown you. I want you to set up nice and light in the grip. You want to let the club move back and then the hips start down while the club is still going back, really feeling that change of direction and the club moving quicker. As you do this, don't be afraid to move the club as fast as you can as long as you stay in balance. What are you doing? Are you... Are you okay? I can't look at any art right now. Honey, it's going to get better. There will be other galleries. May we all know love and peace. May we all understand love and peace. Hi, Jonathan. This is Paul. How are you doing? I think I want to get that Berg painting and surprise Rita. Oh, wow. Oh, this is an incredible piece of news, Paul. Well, yes, that's what I've decided. Awesome. I... I will deliver it to your house tomorrow, and I'll leave it outside the gate. Okay? So don't worry about that. No, no, no, no. You don't need to bring yourself. No, no, I insist. There's a bit of a sad atmosphere around the house right now. And one of the reasons I'm buying the painting is because I thought it would cheer things up a little bit. Yeah, well, you know, we're all in the same boat. Yes, well, it's probably all this staying at home. You know, it gets depressing after a while. Yeah. Well, look, I will deliver it tomorrow, okay? Okay, great. At the same discounted price, right? Same price. Pandemic discount. Just for you. Same price. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I love you. I love you. - Babe? - Yeah? You okay if I go for my run now? - Sure. - See you in about an hour. Uh-huh. Enjoy it. - Love you. - Love you. Hey, Jonathan. - You got it? - Yep. Thank you. It's right out here, - right inside the gate. - Great. Thank you for dropping it off before Monday. I just wanted to make sure. Yeah, I got it. - Bye, Paul. - Bye-bye. I don't understand why this has to be a Zoom call. There's only two of us. I said I'd Zoom you, and here I am. Yeah. You're a real man of your word. Most of the time, I guess. Yeah. I was being sarcastic. Oh. Listen, your friend Paul. Okay? He bought the painting. He saved my ass. That's great news. Well, that's good. Very happy for you. It's been so long since we've been together. Seven weeks. Maybe I could come by. Just see you through the window, maybe? Well, maybe maybe is not good enough. Well, possibly? You know, that's not even funny, Jonathan. I'll be right there. I got to go. My wife's coming. Great. That's just great. I forgot how good you feel. Come here. I'm sorry. I think I got lost there for a while. Well, you're here now. That's all that matters. - Yeah. - You must be fucking kidding. Hi. Hi. I was just trying to call you. What happened? I just heard Jonathan screwing his wife, and... I just caught Rita kissing Harry, the neighbor. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Paul, I'm... I'm so sorry. I just... I feel like I'm in no position to give you any advice. Me neither. I didn't see this coming. Maybe we're just being overly simplistic, and we just couldn't admit it to ourselves. We failed. We did the wrong thing. We're just living in some kind of illusion rather than a reality. It just hurts. It's just that simple. We're not going to get stuck in this, my friend. I myself am moving on. Well, I'm proud of you. - Okay? - Alright. Bye-bye. I'm here for you. Take care. You too. Bye. Maybe it's got something to do with COVID or something. Maybe... Maybe you're stuck in this fucking house all day long. That's your problem. You betray me every day. You betray me with your intellect. Yes, but there is a great difference, isn't there? You're having an affair. Still a mistress. With a guy next door. How the fuck can you compare that to my work? You'll love me if I do the right thing. If I do what you say. You're always so critical and so controlling. Real love is to be at peace with flawed love. There is no perfect love. You know, that's... that's good. Yeah. Thank you. You don't usually hear it because you're always in your own head and everyone else is stupid. No, but I'm the stupid one here. I'm stupider than the people I call stupid. You know what? I got to go. I'll be right back. I've just got to clean out the closet. Where... Where are you going? Something wrong with the food? No, I loved it. Kind of bust this out, you'll notice. Butter these pieces right here. - I really like those. - You will get messy. Maybe we should redo the kitchen. This is a messy job. And line it up. Mr. Marlowe? So I hear you've been having sex with your wife. Fine, Mr. Marlowe. What are you saying with that? I heard you having sex with your wife, you moron. You left the Goddamn Zoom on. She sounds quite nice, by the way. Quite relaxed. Especially someone who, according to you, hasn't had a shag in some time. Well, you knew my situation when we were introduced, sir. Let the tiles sit overnight. You always said I had an eye. I think I've finally started trusting it again. Well, you painted a very different picture of yourself. You did, too. You know, I don't think I can live up to your hopes and dreams. It's too much. When you look at a painting too long, you can stop seeing it. I think I've had the time to focus again and I just underestimated its value. Or pink for the pitchers of water. You're supposed to be with your family. And this is just a mistake. I just wish that I could see it a little bit earlier. Our shine off of our beautiful metallic tile... That's it, then? Now it's time to start grouting. Yeah. That's it. Into the cracks until it is in there nice and tight. Look, take care, Mr. Marlowe. After about 30 minutes, it'll start drying... You too. Take care. I'll turn off my phone now. Great. Now we get to do our first full piece. Uninhibited, no weird cuts, so... Hey. Hey. You know, I made this for you. I think the same of you. Let's dance. Okay. Hey.
