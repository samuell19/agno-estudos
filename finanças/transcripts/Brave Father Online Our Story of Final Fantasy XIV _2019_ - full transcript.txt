Let's go! Maidy, good luck. Maidy, let's wrap it up quickly. My ice cream is melting. Okay! Limit! Break! Yes! Yes! Yes! That was close. "Well played!" Well played. That was a pretty strong enemy. But it was fun. What's next? Let's see... Hey, listen. Three good things happened to me today. Oh yeah? What happened? First... I got off early from work. Second... I saw a cute Pomeranian at a drug store... "Third..." Kirin is always Kirin. - Good morning. - Good morning. Ta-da. Steak and eel for breakfast? Your father is getting promoted to senior managing director. It'll be official at the board meeting. Wow. That's great. Remember his colleague Mr. Saito? His wife told me. He's getting a big raise too. Take half of mine. Too heavy for breakfast. I can't eat all this either. I bought them for a celebration dinner but you two ate out last night. Why didn't Dad tell you himself? He probably wants to wait until it's official. And he lives away from home on the long-term assignment. Still... He's such a mystery. Your lunch. - I'm off. - Bye. She didn't eat much. Miki, you forgot your phone. Like he is to my sister, my father has always been a mystery to me. A typical workaholic. Always on business trips. When he was home, he'd stareat the TV with a stony face... or he'd read a difficult book for hours... Nice shot, sir. Nice shot! Or he'd practice flattering his clients on the golf course... Nice shot! Dad doesn't really care about me. That's what I thought. Good morning, Director. I'm back now. I'm sorry for your loss. Good to have you back. Good morning. - Good morning. - Hi. Are you okay? Yeah. It's over. I never thought I'd cry at my dad's funeral. He was getting old so I'd been preparing myself. It was much harder than I thought. My condolences. These were among his stuff. Tucked away in his closet. I want to know him better. I see. Erotic novel. Erotic novel. Erotic novel. All of them. They'll keep me busy. Hello? What? Isn't his timing off? Why did he quit the company when he's getting promoted? Look at it this way. Now he can live at home. It's like an early retirement. I'm going shopping. Akio, help your dad. There's food on the table. See you later. I'm going out too. Where are you going? I'm meeting my boyfriend. What? Hey...Miki! Finished with the boxes? I'll stack them together. Mom left food on the table. Ignored? When he dies I wonder if I'll cry. I see. Definitely a mystery. I'm confused. He suddenly quit? Maybe he was fired. But he was getting promoted. It could happen. Officially, Mr. Nishiura there resigned amicably. But he made a pass at a client's girlfriend and... Are you serious? It could happen... Could it? You were wonderful, Akira. To you and me. Cheers. We're from HR! What are you doing?! Wait! No! Let go! You've got it wrong! This is international relations! You were wonderful, Akira. Take him! No! Let go of me! No. No way. A father and a son are different people. You don't know everything about each other. At the funeral, my dad's colleagues told me how lively he was and how he always cheered people up. I was surprised. Get to know your dad. All I know about mine is his taste in erotic novels. Does he have a hobby? Hobby... Look at that. I remember buying games at these toy shops. My first game was "The Mystery of Atlantis." My first game was... Dad! Dad! "Toy shop" Anything? Yeah. Anything. Then... This! Final Fanta-"zee"? Final Fanta-"see." There's an old man. A lot of trees. Akio, happy? Yeah. Thanks, Dad. Dad? There's a treasure box over there. That way. Go! Go! Go, Dad. Go! Go! Yes! Yay! Yay. "Leave the magic circle." "Now go, Warriors of Light." Warriors of Light... Alright. Here I go. The only memory I have of playing with my dad. What's the matter, Dad? You saw him? Yeah. He went to the convenience store. Oh... I'm home. Hi. Did you get soy sauce? Sorry. I forgot. What did you buy? Nothing. Do you remember what you ate today? What kind of person is he? What is he thinking? I have no idea. None whatsoever. Your dad must be a complicated person. I have a co-worker like that. I have no idea what goes on in her head. Look who's talking. But... we don't see many people like that in Eorzea. Isn't it strange? In this world, we can be open and honest with each other. You're right. - We feel like we belong. - That's true. This is it. What is it? IlllmlI I'm going to... invite my dad to this world. I won't tell him who I am. But we'll go on adventures together. My father and I will talk to each othe rand share adventures and in the end, we'll fight together to defeat the powerful Twintania. By then, we should have formed a strong bond. I would know more about him. People sometimes keep secrets from their families. It sounds like fun! Your dad is going to be a Warrior of Light. Yes. This is... Operation "Dad the Warrior of Light"! BRAVE FATHER ONLINE OUR STORY OF FINAL FANTASY XIV Final Fanta-"zee"... Final Fanta-"see"... You bought a game? As a retirement gift. From you? That's sweet. Does he even play? I don't know. He's played it before. If he gets stuck, I'll help him. You should try it. Go ahead and use that TV. Let's eat. Okay. In a few minutes. Am I expecting too much? Dad! The final enemy, the Cloud of Darkness, is in the Crystal Tower. Let's beat it together. I'll wait for you. Okay. Beer. You're still playing? Don't overdo it. When can we play? Let's see... Friday night. Promise, okay? I'll wait for you. Here you go. But... the promise was never kept. My father became busy with work. He was hardly ever home and Friday night was no exception. I couldn't wait and fought the final battle by myself. Yes! Looking back at it now, it was when things started getting awkward between us. Since then we started talking less and less. Hey...Dad... The deceased, Yutaka Sato, lived near the scene of the accident. He was hit by a truck and was taken to a hospital on an ambulance. He never regained consciousness and was soon declared dead. The truck driver is being interviewed about what caused the accident. Bro. What? Dad wants to start. Start what? The game. Do you really need it? A screwdriver to set up a video game? Akio, help him. A screwdriver? - No. - I thought so. You insert this in here... Whoa, he's handsome. He's hot. What next? You have to name him? You don't use your real names. So yes. Then... Inoue. What? Inoue. Inoue... So he's Japanese, huh? What's wrong with Inoue? Nothing... But maybe too ordinary. You're going to save the world so... Then... how about a name like a movie hero? Yeah... You're moving. You jumped. You're running. Try to walk straight. Look. Other people. Alright. Here I go. That guy, Indy Jones, is your dad? Yes. Should we go say hi? Um... Yeah? Dad said... I killed the enemy... What do I do next? He wants to know. He gets a reward for the quest. Reward? Quest? From the person with the "!" mark. Okay. Not "kill." Just beat... Hi there! Maidy, you shouldn't just sit here and watch. How about a friend request? Wouldn't he get suspicious? I'm biding my time. I'll approach him slowly. It might take a long time. We have to be discreet. Understood. Okay. Dad, the enemy is too strong. I have to save him. Get away from him! Take this! Oh no, oh no, oh no... What should I do? I thought you were going to be discreet. You said so. But... Just go talk to him. He's looking at us. Are you okay? Dad... Remember back then? Let's go on adventures in the world of FINAL FANTASY again! "Maidy: Are you okay?" What? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! What is he doing? I don't know. What? Someone just saved him. Was it another player? Yeah. "Maybe your dad can't talk because he doesn't have a keyboard." Right. A keyboard. He doesn't know how to talk. Tell him to use a keyboard. Also... You know what? Talk to him yourself. Here. A keyboard. You can use it. A delicious midsummer treat. Strocream, now in stores near you. Cut! - Thank you. - Play it back. What do you think? I think it looks good. Not bad but something's missing. Yes, something's missing. Maybe not. No, maybe not. No. No. Something's missing. Something to showcase the product... We need more sizzle. That's it. We need more sizzle. Brilliant. Right, Iwamoto? Sizzle. Yes. Sizzle... Go tell the director. - But... - Just go do it. Who in the office? Oshima in HR is hot. Yeah, he is. Hello, ladies. A candy bar from my account. It looks good. - For us? - Of course. For the three of you. Enjoy. By the way... let me know how you like it. We will. He's out. He thinks he can impress us with a cheap snack. Satomi, who's your type? Yeah. Do tell. Akio. I think he's kind of cute. He's not bad looking and he's not incompetent... Sometimes his eyes get really serious. I like that face. He also lacks the drive to go for what he really wants. He reminds me... Of who? My dead dog. The timing is so difficult to make a friend request. So difficult... The timing to make my approach. Maidy, what's the matter? I want to send a friend request to my father but I want it to seem spontaneous. I see. The timing is difficult. Maidy. Your dad hasn't logged in today. He started the game a week ago and has played every night at this hour but... Murasaki Shikibu. - Sei Shonagon. - Oh yeah. Could it be...? He needs to do the side quests to level up but he doesn't feel motivated enough... A typical pitfall for online gamers. The answer? Correct. Of course... Isn't Dad eating? He never eats late at night. He's always been like that. So what? Are you a super model? Dad, you're not playing that game tonight. Oh, that... I quit. Is that... Why? I didn't know how to change my outfit but I ended up in... a snowy country. How is this related to you quitting the game? He must have been embarrassed. He's the only one without a coat. Yoshida!! - What's up? - Who knows. Beginners get stuck in unexpected places. I showed him how to change and he happily started playing again. I am really anxious. Your dad is a beginner at video games, right? He doesn't think like us. Send him a friend request? My father is a newbie so he probably won't be suspicious. I shouldn't think too hard about it. You have a point. He should be in this area today running errands. There he is. Okay. Ha! Oh, it's you. Dad. Let's talk a lot here in Eorzea. Let me hear your first words in this world. Who are you? Remember the other day? Did you forget? I have some business to attend to. That was a joke. You're the one who saved me the other day. It was very kind of you. How have you been? He's so formal. But he actually talks in the game. "What a surprise to see you again, Mayday." It's Maidy, not Mayday. Alright. "Send friend request to Indy Jones" "Sent" What? Nothing? Hey. Hello? What? Miki? Who is it? Me. Ow! Come in. What's up? It came. What came? Huh? Friend! A friend request? Go ahead and accept it. Friends will help you. The name will turn orange, which means the person is... your friend. "Accept friend request from Maidy?" "You're now friends with Maidy" Friend... "I'm still new at this but" "I'm looking forward to playing with you." What's this place? This must be your first instanced dungeon. Instanced dungeon? We have to form a party to enter it. Party? Are we going to celebrate something? No. It means we're allies. We all fight together? Yes. We cooperate with each other. I'm a little nervous. Don't worry. We're with you. Kirin will lure the enemy. Aru will revive us. Rest assured. I understand. So what do I do? We're in charge of attacking. Our job is to... defeat the enemy. I see. This world is too big to explore alone. We need to help each other. "So friendship is important!" That's right, Dad. Let's go! Dad is so into the game. When he gets hooked on something, he really gets hooked. I didn't know that. He has a look of accomplishment. That's good. You too? Indy, how was your first party? "Great" is an understatement. Are you having fun? Yes. Serious face... Tam-Tara Deepcroft is next. I should review the strategy. Iwamoto, I need your help. "Strategy blog" FINAL FANTASY? FINAL FANTASY... Wow. Amazing. It's like a movie. You look tired. Are you feeling okay? Yes, I'm fine. I was playing a game all night. What kind? FINAL FANTASY XIV. You play? I do too. As it so happens...By pure coincidence... I recently started. Did you really? It's a lot of fun. It's so cool to meet another player at the office. It's an online game so it's better not to go around looking for players. Yeah. Sure. Hey. Let's talk more about FF. I'd love to. Cool. Iwamoto. Fuumi-en, a major client of ours, is seeking bids from other ad agencies. Why all of a sudden? They have a new account manager, Mr. Nakajima. He says it's just a formality but we can't lose this account. Yoshii, Iwamoto, Sanematsu, you three are in charge. I'm counting on you. Yes, sir. Sorry I haven't been logging in. I've been busy with work. No time for my dad... Don't worry. He's having a great time here. He started fishing. He made a dish with the crayfish he caught. He's also cooking? He's totally enjoying himself. Hello. - Hi, Indy! - Hello! Hello, Mayday. I haven't seen you in a while. We missed you. This... is really Dad, right? I hear the next enemy is a creature called Ifrit. You'll join me, won't you? Now? Yes. You must have missed playing. Fight to your heart's content. "Join Indy Jones' party?" He's so eager. Ifrit now? So this is primal Ifrit! I won't explain anything for now. Alright. Come on. Let's go! Kirin! Get set! Go! Indy, take it easy! Hot! Hot! What's this? Of course... Before an attack a sign appears around your feet. You should watch out for it. "Okay! Boo-ya!" Boo-ya? What? Let's do it! Boo-ya! I see... Go! Hot! Indy, look down! Down? Next! Watch out! Next! This time for sure! Again? Why don't we call it a day? "One more time boo-ya." I know it's frustrating but... It's so late. I'm sorry. "I have an early morning. I should go now." Did you take a bath? I will boo-y... "Fuumi-en" Hello. Hello. It's not a bad proposal. But we want something new, something fresh. Thus, the bid. We want some drastic changes. At this rate, I'm afraid we might ask Nankyu Agency to handle our ads this year. They're planning some big gimmicks. How should I put it? Sizzle. Give us more sizzle. What the hell is "sizzle"?! Yoshii, smile. If we lose this account... Fired?! Maybe not but I can kiss my promotion goodbye. Damn it. "The Mystery of Atlantis" had a surprise loophole. Sizzle is my enemy, "What is sizzle anyway?" the final boss! If we lose this account... Fired?! I'll go home, eat "ochazuke" and refresh my mind. See you tomorrow. See you. Bye. I'm going home too. - Bye. - Bye. Up against the biggest agency in the industry. We'll probably lose... I'm home. Hi. Do you want dinner? No thanks. Where's Dad? Taking a bath. "Mayday: DPS, Kirin: tank" I've been waiting for this day. I want revenge. Watch me. I've grown. Okay. We'll win today. For sure. We'll kick its butt! Yes. Let's fight together and win. Yes. Boo-ya. Kirin! Get set! Here we go. Go! Indy, don't go too near him. Boo-ya. A presentation? It must be a lot of work. But you made me realize something. I shouldn't give up even against a strong opponent. "I apologize for this unsolicited advice." When you're making your presentation you should show your love for the client's product. Love? Yes. I used to work for a manufacturer. I watched a lot of presentations by ad agencies. What matters are passion and enthusiasm. If I don't make any sense, just ignore me. I'll go finish my quest. Yoshii, time for the meeting. Meeting... I don't have any new ideas. Yoshii... Let's not give up just yet. Look. Past ads Mr. Nakajima oversaw. Maybe they'll give us a clue. You're right. Let's go. This is a list of ads overseen by Mr. Nakajima of Fuumi-en. I analyzed the type of ads he seems to prefer. Please take a look. And let me know what you think. You got it. "Ochazuke" The warmth and happiness of ochazuke. A simple message that we'll deliver thoughtfully to the consumers. That's our plan. Thank you. Thank you. Do you have anything else to say? Excuse me. Yes? There's something... I realized when I was preparing this presentation. My father isn't good with words. At home, he doesn't talk unless it's absolutely necessary. What's your point? He never encouraged me when I was studying for the college entrance exams. But... one night... Thanks. For me? I was hungry. I made myself a bowl. I didn't think much of it. I thought he just woke up in the middle of the night. But then... it hit me. My father... never stays up late, much less eat late at night. So he must have made it specially for me. It helped me to get to know him a little better. Even if you can't cook you can make ochazuke for someone you care. We want people to know that. Please... let us help you. We'll do our best. Sirs. Thank you. We'll be in touch. You should've given me a heads-up. I'm sorry. I was really moved. But this is business. It could work against us. We got it! We got the Fuumi-en account! Are you serious? What did you say to them? They were really impressed by our passionate employee. Iwamoto! You're awesome! I had faith in you. I knew they'd understand. You should've heard his story. Oh yeah? Not too exciting but it was great. Akio! Congratulations. Thanks. Let's go celebrate. My treat. A place of your choice. My choice... I know a place. Where is it? Hi there! Good evening! I'm over here! Sorry I'm late. Oh... Big... Gorio? It's me, Satomi. Gorio? My dead dog's name. Okay... Akio, why are you Maidy? Wait. No real names. You never know who's listening. I see. I'll call you Maidy then. Wow... In a way, this is the ultimate date. Complete with a spectacular view. What a coincidence. Mayday, who's this? Hello. I work with Maidy... No! No! No! No! No! No! Let's stay off that topic. I wasn't expecting this. I'm getting worried. That's cute! You're so funny, Indy. It must be my age. Age? How old are you? 60 this year. You're much older than me. Do you have children? Yes. A son and a daughter. My son is very gloomy. He puzzles me. My daughter has poor manners. And... He's coming over. What? Who? I'm Kensuke Kudo, Miki's boyfriend. Nice to meet you. Beer? Yeah. I hear you're an aspiring comedian. I made my debut 10 years ago but I'm still struggling. I have to work side jobs but one day, I'd like to make it official with Miki. You mean, get married? Yes. Oh wow... He'll be in a show this weekend. Yes. If you're interested... - A flyer. - Thanks. One for you. "Live comedy show" Thank you. If you're free, please... You... Do you really understand what it means to start a family? You don't have a steady job. Supporting your family is a big responsibility. Honey... What's your problem? Think about it. Will you be able to send your children to college? Give them a comfortable life? I don't see how you can. Please leave. I'm sorry. Don't leave. Miki... I don't want to be like Mom. You were never home. How do you think Mom felt? Don't get all fatherly on me now! I'm leaving with him. Let's go. Hey! Miki! I'm sorry. Unbelievable. Hey! She's your daughter! This is just a game! But... Which is more important? Um... You have to think? No video game until Miki comes back. But... You're hogging the TV so I've been missing my shows. - Please... I need to play. Things happened today and my dad won't be able to play for a while. Hello, everybody! Hi, Indy! Really? After what happened? You see... I can only play for an hour a day because of family issues but good to see you again today. Why don't we go fight Titan? Sure. But why? Today... I met my daughter's boyfriend. He's an oaf and reminds me of Titan for some reason! The twerp! I'm going to get you, Titan! Take this! Die!! Drop dead!! At this rate, he can probably even beat Twintania. There it is. Watch out. You promised. An hour a day. Yeah but... "Please help me with Titan again." But an hour a day, right? Oh. It's a new day now. He must really be pissed. Everybody else already logged out. No problem. I feel better now after fighting the small enemies. You're really upset about him. Was he that awful? She's never brought home a boy before. His way of life and the way he thinks are so different from mine. Family matters are quite difficult. "Family matters are quite difficult." Your daughter's boyfriend... You've only met him once. Maybe you shouldn't judge him just yet. You have to know the enemy to know how to fight him. Like Titan. Remember? "Live comedy show" Hello. You work here too? I need the money. You had another job all last night. Yes. But it's not enough. Don't push yourself too hard. - I won't. - Not you. We'll see you inside. You're up first. Excuse me. Let's start the show. Up first is Pukumans. I'm pigeon-toed. Pigeon-toed! Sorry I never told you. Wait a minute. I thought it was something serious. Like "you're not my real son" or something. So it's not that kind of talk? Pigeon-toed? Who cares?! I do! I was desperately trying to keep it a secret! - Was born pigeon-toed. - No way. Dad. Why did you come? I want a new controller... Huh? Forget it. To get to know him better? So what do you think? He's funny. Isn't he? I didn't think you cared about me. I'll tell him what you said. It'll make him happy. Miki... Um...He's a decent guy... who works hard, huh? Thank you for the other day. My daughter and I made up. I'm really glad I'm friends with you, Mayday. That's my line. I'm really glad too that we're friends, Indy. "With my son too, I hope..." Dad... Indy, can I join you? Sure. I feel so invigorated. I never thought playing a game could make me feel this way. Indy... There are still so many things I don't know about this world. Meeting people. Friendships. Yes. So... I want to feel more inspired. Alright. Then... why don't we fight Twintania? Twintania? Yes. One of the strongest enemies here in Eorzea. It'll be a difficult battle. But... the stronger the enemy, the bigger the joy of beating him. "I'm getting excited!" Is Twintania that strong? Very strong. The battle ends if even just one player screws up. It's known as the "team jump rope." Team jump rope... Here's a strategy video. I don't have the necessary equipment. What's a good accessory to have? To tell you the truth, I have a ring for you. Will you accept it? Thank you. Oh my God...Did he just propose to her? This is making me cry. What's up? The next enemy... Twintania. I'm going to fight him. Oh yeah? He's strong, right? I don't want to let the other players down. How should I fight? Will you teach me? This... How do I do this? Let's see... You have to... go to the very edge. The edge. Inside the circle. - The edge? - Yeah. - The edge. - Right. See? They're all coming. The guy with the green mark is about to get attacked. That's why you have to disperse. I'm home. Wow. You two together? This is a rare shot. Say cheese. This is great. Mom, look at this photo! Hey... Will you sit next to me during the battle? I mean...lt'd be nice to get some advice. Sorry. I'm busy at the office these days. So I probably can't. Okay. I see. Fine. Tell him who you are? Yes. I think I'm going to after we beat Twintania. Are you serious? It's getting harder and harder to keep it a secret. And I want to play with him like we did when I was a kid. Wouldn't he get angry? Telling him might undermine the trust we've built up. I really don't know. But... through our adventures up to now we've gotten to know each other better. So... after we overcome this big challenge, I want to tell him directly. I want to thank him for everything. I understand. Let's beat Twintania together. Thanks. You can count on us. 959...960... 9,356... 9,357! "Let's beat Twintania!" Then I do this... Done! The battle will be next Friday night. We'll meet here at 21:00. As you know, the enemy is extremely strong. But together, I'm sure we can beat him. "9:00 Friday" Let's share the moment of a great victory! Alright! Here we go. "Friday" Why are you sighing? Not sighing. Taking a deep breath. Deep breath? I'm fighting an important battle tonight. Oh, the game. You're nervous? It's just a game. I have to go now. A gamer through and through. Hello. Thanks for the other day. I really appreciate it. I'm home. Honey? What's wrong? Are you okay? Oh no...Are you okay? Good. No over-time. Yoshii. Yes, Director? About the new project next year at our overseas office... I was expecting this talk. I'm ready. I want to send Iwamoto. It's a critical project for expanding our business in Asia. Do you think he can handle it? You work closely with him. He'll be fine. He's passionate about the job and above all, he's a team player. He'd be a great choice. Yeah? Yes. Iwamoto, huh? So he's been chosen. Director. What is it? You see... Akio. It was detected in his medical checkup. So... that's why he quit his job? He should be hospitalized immediately. Even though he protests... I want to see him. He was sick? What was I doing? It was no time for a game. I should have been doing something else. I should have noticed. Dad... Dad! He's here. Oh no... Are you okay? I'm fine. He's not home. Okay. Where did he go? Hello? Akio, it's almost time. Why aren't you logged in? Sorry. I can't... Indy is so pumped up. "Internet café: we have FF XIV" Good evening. Good evening. Hello. You're here, Mayday. Let's go! You should be in bed. "Wait a minute..." "I want to share with all of you" "our victory over this enemy!" "Let's win!" "We'll beat him together!" Alright. Let's go! Yes. Come on. Here we go. Watch out for the dive! Indy, this way! Okay! Don't dive... Dive...Dive... Over here! Watch out! Again! Yes! There! The green twister is coming. Keep moving. Okay! "Twister" Uh-oh! Twister! Here it comes! Watch out! Twister! Twister! "Twintania" Come on. Keep going. Go! Almost there... Almost! "Twintania" Indy! Finish him off! Indy, Limit Break! Okay. Go! Yes. We're almost there! Go!! Take this!! Limit Break!! Go!! Thank you very much. There's something I have to tell you. What is it? I can't play for a while. You see... I'm. "Are you okay?" "To be honest, I don't think so." "The doctor recommends surgery." "But.." "I didn't have the courage." My life was all about my job. But... I lost everything when I had to quit my job because of my illness. The surgery seemed pointless. I didn't know what my role was other than the family's breadwinner. I wanted to rekindle my bond with my family. But I didn't know how after all these years. I was at a loss. It felt meaningless to be alive. I was thrust into darkness. "I was thrust into darkness." Dad... But... playing the game with you all took me back to those days when I played with my son. I felt at peace with myself. I found out that life can still be fun and that I still have a place in this world. Finally, I have the courage to battle my disease. I defeated Twintania after all. You fought well. Now come home. Dad. We're waiting for you at home. "Dad. We're waiting for you at home." "Good." "We beat the enemy together this time." Dad... You remember. That's right. He's not good with words but... Dad has always been... Akio! You okay? Can you get up? Be careful. Dad. Yes? Mr. Iwamoto. Yes. Honey... Don't worry. A disease isn't that great of an enemy. It'll be an easy win. Because... we've beaten a stronger enemy. Right? Dad. Thank you. To us, Dad is... a true Warrior of Light. That's what I thought. "A year later" This is Sanematsu. Hello. Yoshii. Yes, Director? Iwamoto called. They're short-staffed over there. They want someone who can speak English. You can count on me. I'll leave tomorrow... How about Sanematsu? Good choice. - Right? - Yes. So you two aren't a couple? We were worried about your long-distance relationship. So you don't see him at all? I see him all the time. In Eorzea. This is where I first talked to Dad.
