In practically all important respects, this is a true story. Wherever possible, we have used the original locations and even the actual words spoken. It is the account of a family, the Courtier family. There they are. Gene, Doris, and their two kids, who, because of one of those passing split second decisions learned that The Night Holds Terror. Jack Kelly is Gene Courtier. Hildy Parks is Doris Courtier. Vince Edwards, John Cassavetes and David Cross as the three vicious criminals who invaded their lives. What happened to the Courtiers could happen to you! I had been to Los Angeles and was returning home. See, I lived at the Edwards Air Force Base, that's out in the desert near Mojave. I had a wonderful family and a good job. What more could a man ask for? Then I spotted a fellow trying to hitch a ride. That's how it all began, on the afternoon of February 16th, 1953. It was one of those quick impulsive decisions, but I stopped. I go as far as the dry lake road. It's just outside of Mojave. That's far enough. - Take you as far as Edwards. - You work at the air base? Yeah, I'm at North American. At first I thought this was a Lincoln. These Mercs look a lot like 'em in the front. Yeah, but it's a smooth little buggy though. You really skim right along in it. Suppose you hold it at 50? Why 50? Because I say so. With this. Exactly at 50 buddy, on the dot. - This is a stinkin' trick. - Yeah, I know. Better watch those bumps. She's got a hair trigger and will go off at the least little jar. Okay, okay, so I'm doing everything you say. You just better keep it up, mister. Now let's have your wallet, come on. Okay. Come on. But you sure picked the wrong car. 10 bucks? That's all you got? I spent the rest. That's why I went into LA this morning, to get some parts for a hi-fidelity recorder I'm building. They're right there in the back. Fellas aren't gonna be happy about this. Not happy at all. Why are you doing that? They'll be catching up to us pretty soon. They're kinda skittish about having you see their faces. Oh. I wouldn't try looking back if I were you! Look, you got all my money, what more do you want? Why don't you let me go? It's not that simple, buddy. Now you just drive straight ahead. I'll tell you where to turn off. It was just before Redman that they made me turn off on this little-used road that wound its way to the Rosamond Dry Lake. It was a wild and desolate part of the country bordering on the Mojave desert. Why, why had I stopped to give that guy a lift? I was taking a chance, I knew that! Yet, nearly everyone's picked up a hitch-hiker one time or another. Haven't you? Now put both hands on the wheel. Keep your eyes straight ahead of you, understand? Okay, now slide out. Slide out carefully. Don't try to look around. You just don't try anything out of line, buddy! All right, take one look in my direction, fella and I'll kill you now, it's that simple. You know how much dough this drip had? 10 bucks. 10 lousy bucks. You shoulda stopped a Lincoln. So, I thought it was a Lincoln! 'Cause Mercs look a lot like 'em. Take your coat and shoes off. What do you guys want, what are you gonna do? I said take that coat off! Come on. Now walk straight ahead of you. All right, lie down on your face! I hope for your sake you haven't been holding out on us. You sure drew a blank. What am I, psychic? How am I supposed to know how much dough this guy's carrying? How do you want it, buster? Straight in the head while you're lying there or do you want to run for it and get it in the guts? Why do you have to kill me? Why? Never heard of a stiff fingering a guy, did ya? There's your answer. But he hasn't seen us. He did me. Fellas, give me a break. I promise I won't go to the oops, I promise it! Why should I over a lousy 10 bucks? If you'll just let me go... Fat chance. But I got a wife and two kids! You've gotta listen to me! Shut up! It's about time you got a few notches on your gun. How about it? - This is your idea. - Are you yella? Maybe, if not wanting to kill a guy is being yella. All right! You haven't got the guts, I'll do it myself. Could be you need glasses. Are you kidding? Anyone could see I was only trying to nick his ear. Yeah, yeah, that's a good one. All right, I'll prove it to ya! I'll do it again! How 'bout it, fella? Did I hit it that time? If you're gonna kill me, get it over with, will ya! That did it. Told ya not to move. Maybe I hadn't made up my mind before. Now I gotta let you have it. This'll be a dead shot right between the eyes. It's a shame killin' a guy for 10 bucks! A stinkin' shame! Maybe you got something there. Could be that we don't have to kill him at all. That is, for only 10 bucks. Meaning what? Is that Mercury in your name? Yeah. Oh listen, that car's plenty hot. We could never unload it. We're not going to, where's the pink slip? I still owe a couple hundred bucks on it. The pink slip's at Stranske Motors. Where are they? It's right over there in Lancaster. I'll help you sell it. I'll even sign the pink slip over to you. I'll do anything you say! - What do you think? - I like it. I don't like it, it's too risky. But I'll cooperate with you in every way! You can count on it! That we can. That car's worth at least two thousand dollars. You fellas can realize $1,800, that's a lot of dough! Brush yourself off. Take one look toward our license plates and we'll kill you now. He told the truth all right. It's his car, and the legal owner's Stranske. Come on, let's get started. - By the way, fella... - His name's Gene Courtier. Lives over at that housing project at Edwards. Anyway... Don't let that ear business fool you. I'm a dead shot. That yellow flower over there, do you see it? Yeah. Now you don't. - Do I make my point? - Perfectly. Now let's go. I'll follow. I don't want you to look back toward the other car. Lie in the back, keep your head down. You try anything funny, Courtier, you'll get a slug. Here's how, just that easy. Tell him you want the money in cash. That's a must. We'll cook up a good reason for it right now. I'd read about the bodies being found in the desert with a bullet hole in the head. I figured once they got their hands on the money, my turn would be next. Don't get any funny ideas in your head Courtier, like trying to outsmart us. Guess you know by now we mean business. If I have to, I'll kill everybody in the place. It was hard to believe that this was really happening, in broad daylight in a car showroom on a busy street, yet I was but a split-second from death! The length of time it would take to draw a gun! Slim as my chances were, I'd have to make a break for it! Now! It was then that I noticed this side door. It was wide open. Could I make it? I wondered... It was all a matter of odds. How quick could he get out his gun? How quick could I make the door? The car would offer some protection if I could crouch low enough as I ran. It meant taking a desperate chance. But I'd made up my mind to make a try for it. This was it! Then something happened. I couldn't take the risk of that woman and little boy getting killed! Why did they have to show up at this very moment? I was trapped, I knew it. But all I could do now was play along with them, make it seem like I was on the level. 100 percent on the level. Hope and pray for some kind of a break. I can't do $2,400, fellas. Best I can do is $2,000, tops. Okay, make it 21 and it's a deal. Sorry fellas. $2,000's my sealing. That car's worth at least $2,100 and you know it. Then you better take it to somebody else. All right, Mr. Stranske. But it must be in cash, all cash. - All cash? - Yeah. Then you won't take my check? Well, my wife had an accident. She's up in a hospital in Oakland. She was visiting her folks and... That's why he's gotta sell the car. He needs the money right away. But even so, it's right unusual. Besides, the banks are all closed after three o' clock. How much cash do you have? 500 bucks, maybe. You'll still have to come around for the rest in the morning. But I should leave tonight! Then I'm sorry. Well... I guess you'll just have to wait until morning. Come on in the office, fellas. You go get a cab. All right, Mr. Courtier. I work at North American. I bought the car here in the first place. Matter of fact, you still got the pink slip. You want a drink? Never needed one worse. Silver Saddle. Hey, passengers have to ride in the back! That's okay. Let's have it. And again I had that almost overpowering urge to run for it! Bullet in the back was better than this. They were planning something new. That much was for sure. Gimme a screwdriver. Double shot of anything. I got bad news for you, Courtier. Those fellas are mean babies. So? So they want the rest of that dough. That makes it rugged. But I'll stay in the car. I'll go to a hotel with you. I won't give you any trouble. I know you won't. But how about your wife? What's she gonna do when you don't Show, that's what... Look I don't care what you do with me, but leave my family out of this! Watch it! Remember fella, we got your address off the registration. We know where your family lives, so take it easy. That trigger-happy guy isn't going to my house. I don't care what happens. Knock it off! Be smart. They just as may put a slug in you is not. Besides, if you try anything stupid, they take it out on your family. Your only Chance is to play along with them. Okay, let's go, we're leaving. Come on, back door. Come on, let's go. - Where are we going? - Your house. My house? You wouldn't really go to my house. You wouldn't do that! Look, I can call my wife and make a good excuse to her for not being there. She won't give you any trouble, I promise it! Oh please, you can stand right by the phone when I talk to her, you can hear everything I say, every word! Look, Courtier. We're not taking any chances with you. We're going to your house, so stop your yappin'! There's nothing you can do about it. He was so right. What could I do? Even if I did get away, I couldn't run the risk of them taking it out on my family. Give him the tape glasses. Put 'em on, come on. Come on, let's go. One thing was dead certain, they wanted to make plenty sure I didn't get a look at their license plates. We'll take the long way around. I want it to be good and dark when we reach his house. If you hadn't owned that jalopy, you'd be lying out in the middle of the desert right now, with a bullet in you. You know that, don't you Courtier? Is your wife pretty? Yes, why? He's the most dame-crazy jerk I've ever seen. He can't keep his hands off women. Who? The one that got fresh with that taxi driver broad. Thanks for warning me. What's it worth to you to get my family and me out of this? Skip it, there's not a chance. Would 10 thousand bucks interest you? Ah, you're nuts. Where you gonna get that kind of lettuce? My dad. You heard of those Courtier markets in LA? And he'll give me 10 grand, just like that? Look, I'll make it 20. You can have the money in the morning. Take my word for it! Not interested. You're goof in' off. You think I'd cross these guys up and get a slug in my head just 'cause of a screwball promise like that? How dumb do you think I am? Please believe me, I'm on the level. Take my word for it! Cut it out. Daddy, where have you been? Mommy was sure worried about you! Where have you been? You promised you'd be home by three o' clock! I've been frantic! Mommy, the man's got a gun! Why has he got that gun on you Daddy, why? Honey, I've been held up. Honey, you've got to take it easy. Why is he here? What's he doing in the house? Look, you and the kids get in the back room. I'll explain everything to you just as soon as I can. Tell me now, I want to know! What about you? Honey, everything will be all right, just hurry! Hope you don't mind us using your garage. Go down to your bedroom, now run! There's no sense in him leaving the car out for the neighbors to stare at. Honey, would you get out of here, please hurry! No one here but his wife and kids. They're in the bedrooms back there. Boy, electronics must pay off. The guy's loaded. Any guns in the house? No. I'm afraid to keep one around because of the children. You'd better not be lying to me. Check every drawer and closet just to play safe. Where's the phone? - It's right over there. - I'll cut the wires. No, phone company might get suspicious and send someone out. Check the back rooms, make sure they can't get away. You stay here. While we're here you'll do exactly as I say, and I mean exactly! Look fella you got a wife and a couple of kids back there. You better not start anything. You're pretty brave with that gun in your hand, aren't you? Relax, take it easy. Got the whole night to go yet. Hi. What are you doing here? What do you want with us? I'll ask the questions, sweetheart. Now you just don't try screamin' or anything like that. Do just as you're told and we're gonna get along OK. Anybody likely to drop in here tonight? No, no one that I know of. Sure are a couple of nice looking kids. You wouldn't dare touch them! You wouldn't dare! Hey, you're imagining things, sweetheart. We're nice guys, we don't want to hurt anybody. That is, if we can help it. Now you wouldn't try anything foolish like trying to get out that window there, would you? Remember, we got a gun trained on your old man. And don't you forget it. I don't know what you want with us, but get out of here! OK. I never expected to find a sharp lookin' doll like you stuck out here in the middle of the sticks. It's all right, Stevie. It's all right. Didn't find anything in the bedrooms. Well, there are other rooms! You know, you're some host. How about a drink? None for me. Didn't you say that thing had a hair trigger on it? Yep. Well the safety catch is off, in case you didn't know it. I know it. - Expecting any calls? - No. You expecting any calls? Gene's dad, I talked to him earlier. What about him? He lives in LA, I thought he must have seen Gene. I told him I'd call him back when Gene got here. Answer it! No Doris, stay where you are. I don't want you to see his face. It's a little late to be worrying about that, isn't it? Didn't you hear what I said? Answer that phone! No, I'll get it! I wouldn't try it if I were you, buster. You want me to come in there and get you? Come on, hurry up. Come on, come on! If it's his old man, tell him everything's OK. Make it sound natural. Say one word out of line, it's gonna be your last. Should've answered it sooner. Don't stall around like that again, I'm warning you! Hello? Dad! No, you had the right number before. Gene? He had a little tire trouble. Yes, I'll tell him. Goodbye. Did you call anyone else about him being late? You better tell him, honey. The state police. What did you say? Gene was late and I was worried. I called Harry Osmond. He's a friend of ours. Then what? He checked to see if there were any accidents and there weren't, but that's all. I hope so for your sake. How dare you! How dare you come in our home this way, ordering us around, threatening us with guns! Now go and get out, all of you, just get out! Oh shut up, will ya! All right, get this straight. We'll just soon kill you and your whole family is not. Ask him what happened today. Go ahead, ask him. Came so close to gettin' it it wasn't even funny. He's right, lady. These boys aren't foolin'. What did happen today? He took a shot at me. He just grazed my ear. I suppose it gave you a sadistic thrill. Yeah. How did it feel to know you were gonna be killed? Just accepted, that's all. Boy, you're a cool one, I'll say that for ya. Look honey, it'll be all over with in the morning. I had to sign our car over to 'em. They can't get the money until the bank opens. How about some coffee? I'll make it. See who it is. Come on, come on! Gosh, it's Phyllis Harris. I borrowed some cigarettes from her earlier. Go ahead. Oh Gene, we were so worried about you. I thought I'd come over and sit with Doris until you got back. Well I'm home now, everything's all right. So I see. Is Doris there? She got tired, so she went to bed. Good night, Phyllis. - Well, night. - Good night. Now you're playing smart. Think I'll take a shower. How about some scrambled eggs with that coffee? I'll give you a hand. Stay where you are, Courtier. Please don't start anything. She's so right, especially with a couple of kids in the house! There's a limit to this. Sit down and shut up! Gene, do what he says! You heard the little lady. Gene please, for my sake! Okay. Does he roll over twice when you snap your fingers? Now what would you do with a gun pointed at your head? How about it? No thank you. Come on over, sweetheart. Get off of me! OK. Care to kiss me on the forehead? I know what you said! What did he do? I can't take any more of this! If you're gonna kill us, kill us now and get it over with, will you? Oh, will you get her out of here? I'll make that coffee. Come on honey, let's go. Lay off her, do you hear? Yes sir. Anything you say, boss man. It's Harry Osmond. You watch it Courtier. This is no dumb dame to deal with this time. You've got to keep him from coming in. If anything goes wrong, we'll blast the both of you. Well, I'm sure glad you got back all right. Doris was pretty worried when I talked to her. Everything's all right now, thanks a lot Harry. Oh hey wait a minute... I've been transferred to Oregon. We dropped in to say goodbye. Oh honey! Doris is in bed. I think the worrying got her down. Oh, that's too bad. We'll only stay a minute. I don't think Doris wants to see anybody tonight. She just isn't up to it. She'll never forgive us if we don't even say goodbye. Look, I'm afraid that we can't see you tonight. You'll have to excuse us. Well all right Gene, if that's the way you want it. - Goodbye, Gene. - Goodbye. It was an endless, torturous night. We knew that we had to string along with 'em. Even if we had to count to 10 over and over and over again, all night long. I think I'll turn in. He was using our bedroom of course. He'd have thought he owned the house, but it worried me, his leaving the room. I had a sickening feeling that Romeo was just biding his time until he was out of the way. Would you like to dance? If you don't mind I'll see how the children are. What's the matter? Afraid your old man will get jealous? I just don't care to dance, that's all. Well I do. You leave her alone. Hey, you talk big, fella. It just so happens we're running the show. Or do you want a reminder? Gene, please! Take this guy into the back bedroom, and if he gives you any trouble, call me. Come on, get going. Gene, please don't do anything foolish. Gene, as long as the children are here, we just have to take it. At least if you're here you'll know what's going on. I'll dance with you. That's my gal. Gene! Oh shut them up! Look, he'll be all right. If you don't shut those kids up, I will. Honey, go in the back, will you? Just let out one more scream like that it'll be your last. If that drooling idiot makes one more pass at my wife, it'll be his last, I don't care what happens! All right, get him out of here. I oughta kick your brains in. You want the whole neighborhood on our back? Okay, okay, forget it! There's only one window in that bedroom, in plain view from the kids' room. Mommy! All right dear, nobody's going to hurt us. Now... You two sit here all night so they can see you from the other room. You can watch it from in there. One of us will always have an eye on 'em, that's for sure. Now... You go in there and check up on them every once in a while when they least expect it. Otherwise, leave 'em alone. Bye now. You have a real nice pleasant sleep. I intend to. You know something? What? Nobody socks me and gets away with it. Just nobody. Gene, what do you want with the scissors? Look honey, we've been over and over and over this thing, haven't we? Yes. And we're down to the last resort. What are you going to do? I'm gonna get one of their guns. - How? - Shh! With the scissors. Look, the liquor's making him sleepy. What about the other one? He keeps dousing his head with water to stay awake. He's been to the bathroom twice already. But the one on the bed is only drowsing. If you go for his gun you're gonna wake him up. Shh! Hey come on, snap out of it. I'm having enough trouble keeping awake. Oh, relax. It just seems so utterly fantastic. But it isn't just us, you know that. If only he'd drowse off in time. I think I can try in a minute. How do you know you'll kill him right away? Maybe he'll still go for his gun or cry out or warn the others. Gene, don't do it! Please don't do it! Hold it! I said hold it, that goes for you too! Are you nuts, he was gonna kill me! - Bust his skull wide open! - I meant what I said! What is this? I'd take it easy if I were you. Could be the boss would do a little skull massaging himself if he knew what happened. Maybe you just better forget the whole thing, if you're smart. Another half second. Why did I hesitate? I could've killed him. I wonder. What do you mean? I saw you hesitate, and I wonder, that's all. I could've killed him. Yes. 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 95. $1,795, thank you. They had me over a barrel, but good. What could I do, guy waiting back there at the house, his gun trained on Doris and the kids? Lancaster back to the housing project was a 20 minute ride. 20 agonizing minutes before we'd know the answer. Doris, Deborah, Steven, all of us. Would we live, or would we die? I've been trying to get the children to eat a little breakfast. How about some coffee? Yeah, sure. Got some bad news for you. What do you mean bad news? You got the dough, didn't you? Yeah, 800 bucks. 800 bucks? And what are you guys handing me? Courtier owed more on that old jalopy than he thought he did. He said a couple of hundred bucks! So he was wrong. How wrong can a guy get? Are you trying to tell me he owed over a grand and didn't know it? Maybe he's got a short memory. And maybe somebody else has a shorter one! All right, what did you get for that car? Leave me out of this. If it wasn't for me, you'd have had your head split wide open last night. Now I'm asking you for the last time, come on, give. You're over 21, figure it out yourself. Thanks, that's all I wanted to know. Trying to make a little trouble, Courtier? One more crack out of you and I'm gonna close that big mouth of yours for keeps. You give me the rest of my dough and give me it quick, or... Or what, buster? You had something on your mind, what was it? Of all the stinkin', lousy, chiselin' double-crossers... That did it, I don't want any part of you guys! Okay. Okay, so you win. But I'm gettin' off at the next stop. You're not getting off at any stop! You're in this for keeps, and don't you forget it. Nobody's gonna walk out on nobody. I should've had better sense than let a cheap little punk like you carry a gun. All right, get my bag, we're leaving. Come on, everybody in the living room, go ahead! How can I make you believe? We just want to be let alone. I won't call the police or tell anyone ever, I promise you. I give you my word. That's one for the book. You could tie us up, it would be hours before anybody comes by. There's some rope out on the back porch, you could use that. What is this, a game of Scouts and Indians? Sugar plum, we're a couple of mugs with murder raps hanging over us. What are you going to do? Mommy! You wouldn't dare! The whole country would be up in arms! They'd lynch you from the nearest post. I'm afraid you've both been seeing too many crime thrillers. Here, put that in my bag. Matter of fact, I've grown very fond of both of you. What a charming family group. I think I'll take this along with me, show my friends what you all look like. You know, my pals at the mafia. If anything should happen to us, they might like to drop in on you so you could offer your condolences. - Oh, let's go. - Wait a minute. You're coming with me. Why? What do you want with my husband? Obviously I'm to be a hostage. If anything happens to us, he's dead, Doris. That's the way it's gotta be. Why should I call the police? I'm a mother. I have two children. They mean a thousand times more to me than seeing you behind bars! Doris, Doris! Why should I care whether you're caught or not? Do you think I'd do anything in this world that would endanger the lives of my family? - Well, do you? - Honey... It's the way I want it. If it'll get them out of the house away from you and the kids, it's OK with me. Let's go. - Oh Daddy! - Come on, let's go! I'll give you a half hour, - exactly a half hour! - Shut up! If Gene doesn't call me in a half hour, I'm gonna call the police, do you hear? I'm gonna call the police! You want the whole neighborhood to hear us? I mean exactly what I say! He'll call you when he's good and ready, not before. Mother, what are they gonna do to Daddy? Debbie, take Stevie and go next door to Phyllis' house as quickly as you can! I've got to get the two of you out of here. But wait a minute, go out the back door, come on. I'll call Phyllis and give her some excuse for keeping you. Debbie! Debbie, you do understand, don't you darling, that you mustn't say a word about what's happened here. Not to anyone! Daddy's life depends on it. I know, Mother. Okay, what's the big idea? We're going back to the house in exactly five minutes. - Check it. - How come? Your wife smart? Yeah, why? Because if she's not, we'll be reading about you in the papers tomorrow. In the obituary column. What do you mean? If she calls the police, we'll know it. How? Because of a sliver of paper. It'll fall off if she lifts the receiver. - That's pretty cute. - Yeah, pretty cute. Five minutes is up. You hear a shot, your wife wasn't so smart. You see this? It'd fallen off if you'd lifted the receiver. I just thought you'd like to know. Where are the kids? They're out back, playing. Yeah? If I were gonna notify the police, I wouldn't have used the kids. I'd have used the phone, wouldn't I? Yeah. Maybe you got something there. Besides, you're too smart to try any tricks. I mean, we have a gun pointed right at your husband's back. 3T25, 3T25, a traffic accident. Vernon and Maine. Why didn't you tell my wife you were tuned in to the police calls? Slipped my mind. Don't hand me that. You could've stopped her from calling the cops for sure if you told her about this! You are naive. Why does he make it like a funny man? If the police were alerted to our hookup they'd hardly be liable to put out an APB over the radio, now would they? This way, buster, we got the coppers cooperatin'. She should be foolish enough to call them, they'll let us know. In three minutes flat. Hello? I'll have to call you later. You'll have to hang up, Mr. Raglin. I'm sorry. Wasn't that Gene's boss? Oh it's you, Phyllis. - Well that was Mr. - Raglin down at the plant. I had to get him off the phone. I couldn't let him call and get a busy signal. Who's them? Look honey, what cooks? Anyone can tell from the way the kids are acting... Did they say anything? Nothing, and they were pretty obvious about it. Amy's keeping an eye on them, this is her wash day. Who? Look honey, what's the matter, what's happened? Do you want to talk? Phyllis, what I'm about to tell you may cost Gene his life if you don't keep your mouth shut! Stop here for gas, that's a cinch. Bright boy. Look, here's a tip. A million dollar tip. If they swing up that Dry Lake road, you'd better make a run for it. I don't stand one chance in 10. That guy's a deadshot. It's better than your chances if you stick. Thanks. I just don't understand you. Just that I don't want to be tied in with no murder, that's all. Don't give me that guff. Try to make me think I'm the first sucker you guys have nailed? Look, I just met these guys a couple of nights ago. I thought it'd be a simple heist. I don't go for this stuff. Hey, watch it. Three dollars. Thank you. 13T9, 13T9. Ambulance traffic on Avalon Boulevard, code two. 7094, clear. 13997, that unit is code seven. - When did they leave? - About 20 minutes ago. We better call Gene's father. - Phyllis, I don't dare! - Why? Suppose those hoodlums call here and get a busy signal? We'll call from my house. I can't leave the phone! I'll call for you. - Phyllis, it's too risky! - Why? Suppose Gene's father loses his head and calls the police! He wasn't here last night, he doesn't know those men. But still, if you're going... Besides, an operator might overhear or something. Phyllis, I can't take that chance. OK, I'll call the FBI, explain everything. They'll know what to do. - That's too risky! - Why? Those men are fiends! - They might find out. - How could they? I don't know, but... They said they'd kill Gene if I told anybody. They meant it. But we've got to do something, and do it quickly! We've got 10 minutes left, then the half hour's up. We just have to wait, that's all. It might be too late. Phyllis, what am I gonna do? Wait the 10 minutes, and call everybody. 12L20, Roger, all units code four... You guys had me a laugh. You both think you're geniuses, but you're a couple of chrome-plated jerks. Yeah? Any jarhead can bump a guy off, but it takes brains to turn a guy into a goldmine. 200 grand, for instance. All right, quit horsin' around, come to the point. I will if you slow down. I can't think with my brains rattlin' around. You know who this guy's old man is? Who? Ever hear of those Courtier markets in LA? His old man's the guy that owns 'em? - Uh-huh. - How do you know? Gene told me. He tried to bribe me to let him go with 50 grand! Maybe he was lying. Come to think of it, Courtier is an unusual name. I found this when I was lookin' for the guns. Hey, it's a letter from his old man. Company stationery. What do you know? As long as we've kidnapped the guy anyway we might as well go wholehearted. Don't you try that again! Hey we've got a barrel on that. That stupid broad's liable to call the cops at that. It's my guess she wasn't kidding about that half hour deal. It was 10:44 when she made that crack. I glanced at my watch. - It's nine after 11 now. - I got 12 after. If anything comes over the radio about us let him have it. Phyllis, it's nine seconds past my deadline. People can't always find a phone, especially when they're on the road. A lot of things could've happened. Like Gene getting a bullet in his back! Her half hour's up by six minutes in case anyone's interested. So let the tomato call the cops. It'll be Courtier's funeral, and I do mean funeral. Look, if you guys realize I'm getting 200 grand, it's okay by me... A car headed for Los Angeles. Approach with caution, occupants are armed. Description of car: Ford convertible, blue color. License 58-Nelly-4316, 58-Nelly-4316. There's a general joint about a mile or two down the road. We can phone from there. Phone in a booth? Yeah yeah, and it's made to order. It's in a corner by itself where nobody can overhear. You're an idiot if you don't call the police, and fast! How, I can't leave the phone! Then use it! What if those gangsters call here and they get a busy signal? It can't be helped. We'll have to talk to them... Los Angeles Police Department. Please, it's an emergency. You'll have to talk to them yourself. They'll want a complete description of the men and... Just a minute. Here, tell them all the dope you can give them. Hello? Three men have taken my husband. He's being held as a hostage. Just a moment please, I'll have to transfer you to homicide. Homicide operator, please. Now be sure to cut that phone call short, and I mean short. - You said that three times... - Is that important? Are you sure you got everything straight? I don't want any slip-ups. Described as male Caucasian... But he didn't see the license? Well anyway, you've given us a good description on the men, that helps. Excuse me Mrs. Courtier, I'd better get this right up to dispatch, bye. APB in a rush. And make it a press flash. Better make it a 211. And a possible 207. 207, but that's a kidnapping! I said a possible 207. All right, when you get that finished, take it up and tell the type room yourself, will you? Yeah. Now tell your wife you're OK, and that's all. We'll do the rest of the talking, it won't be much. So we wait. Got any change? No. I'll get some at the bar. Good going, pal. Look this kidnapping gimmick's just a stall. Gives you more time to get away. What if I don't? At least the deal's got a pretty big payoff. Sure, a Jim Dandy. A cheer. This is a rush! The All Points Bulletin on Gene Courtier will be panned out over the teletype network to the several hundred law enforcement agencies tied into the hookup. The bulletin was duplicated photographically. Copies will be dispatched to all departmental nerve centers. In this way, the entire facilities of the force can be thrown into synchronized action. Phyllis, go to your house and call Gene's father. Tell him to get here as quickly as he can, please! OK. 23 minutes past her mark. Hey look sister, are you gonna yak over this phone all day? If you'd stop heckling me I'd be through a lot sooner. Come on, let's go for a drink. In its routine processing, one copy of the Courtier bulletin went to Chief of Detectives Cole. Other copies were placed in a press tray, one for each newspaper and syndicate that had code 20 call for the boys in the press room being notified immediately. Simultaneously the bulletin was placed on a conveyor belt. This would carry it directly to the communication center. At 11:14 am, it was in the hands of one of the radio dispatchers receiving a final check. Give me the number. Lancaster, 2343. Lancaster 2343. Thank you, your number please. Empire 3-2140. Deposit 45 cents for the first three minutes, please. 2343, San Fernando calling. Go ahead, please. - Hello? - Hi, sugar. - Gene, what about Gene? - He's here. How long before you're gonna let him go? When will I see him? Sooner than you think. - You know where, sweetie? - Where? At a marble slab in the morgue. That is, if you're silly enough to go squealin' to the cops. I wouldn't be that foolish, would I? Now look, I'll cut it short. You get the old man out there. We want 200 grand, cash on the line. That's a must. 13L21, 13L21, calling the station. Just say you're OK. Come on, come on! Honey? Yeah, yeah. The car radio, it's tuned into the police calls! We're gonna settle with you later, wiseguy. She had to wait until the air was clear. Her signal was that bottom light. Operator... Operator! Give me the Los Angeles Police Department, quickly! Gene's dad, they couldn't locate him. - I left a message... - Yes? - The circuits are busy. - What happened? You send for me? Yeah, what about this APB in Courtier? You got it down as a possible 207. We don't have enough facts on it yet to know whether to work on it as a hostage or kidnap. You'll work on it as a kidnap. I've got to stop the police, I've got to! Break room. All units, be on the lookout for three male white American suspects. Cancel that APB. Good. Call communications immediately. Yeah? See that it's canceled all the way down the line. Yes ma'am we stopped 'em. We got in just under the wire. It's Mrs. Courtier. Chief of Detective Cole speaking. They're holding her husband for ransom, $200 thousand. Hello Mrs. Courtier? We'll get back to you in a few minutes. Oh... Yeah, I see. Uh-huh. Right, goodbye. The kidnappers were tuned in on the police calls. Boy, that was close. Within the hour, a hushed meeting was held at the home of Chief of Detectives Cole. A procedure to avoid any unusual activities around the department. Well, what did you find out? Detective and division's on the way to headquarters. Oh good. Did you explain to him about straddling in? Act as if nothing was up. - Most emphatically. - Fine, no. I want you to start assembling a flying squad of 50 men in plain clothes and private cars. We must be able to saturate any district within a few minutes. Kidnappers are probably watching the Courtier house. No, we gotta keep everybody away. Oh, I'm sending Mason over to her neighbor's house to watch the kids. Excuse me. Henderson. Thank you for getting here so fast, sir. Cole. This is Bob Henderson, special investigator from the phone company. - Hey. - Hey. Let's go inside, we can talk in here. Mrs. Courtier heard the telephone operators say San Fernando calling. Well that puts them smack on the Los Angeles area. Yes, but the kidnappers gave our operator a funny number. We don't know where they called from. Well the fact that Lancaster's along distance call, it helps matters, doesn't it? Well, some. Of course our wired teams will be alerted - in all Los Angeles. - Good. And I've ordered cards with the Courtier's number on them placed before every long distance operator in the area. I only hope there's no leak. The kidnappers will be watching every paper, listening to every broadcast. Yeah, yeah, but suppose I can't reach Harry? You trust a babe? - Meaning Joy? - Yeah. - Maybe, she got a car? - Yeah. She can make Edwards in about 90 minutes flat. Could be a good idea. That's a straight drop. I wouldn't try it if I were you. Write her number down. If there's a cop within a block and a half of the house, she'll smell him out. Pretty fancy joint. Swank, huh? This is the news broadcast. While I'm gone, catch 'em all, every one. Turn it on. I'm going out of town. Better turn on the television set, too. Bye now. Cigarette? Match? I said I'd settle with you, wiseguy. Next time you mess with me you're really gonna get it. Lay off him, will ya lay off? I count on you. Thanks a lot. By 2pm, Gene's dad had been contacted. But raising 200 thousand dollars in immediate cash was a superhuman job at best. Mr. Baker, please. No, I can't wait, I've got to talk to him right away. Tell him it's Courtier. - Mrs. Courtier? - Yes. - I'm a reporter, Los Angeles. - What do you want? Well, an APB came through, said your husband had been abducted. Oh, that was a mistake. There was nothing to it, it was canceled. But there was some reason for it in the first place. Exactly what did happen? Nothing, please just forget about it! - But Mrs. Courtier... - Please, you'll just have to excuse me. He's gone. Now what? Just a second. I picked up a reporter, he's talking to Mrs. Courtier. He seems to be calling the shots. Have him brought in immediately. Uh-oh, this isn't so good. Live wire like that, they'll never give up on a scoop like this. Well, there's one way out. Don't make it a scoop. If it's what I think you mean, it's dynamite. Call the boys together in the press room. Just one of 'em crosses us up, we're dead, you know. So is Courtier. It's up to us to make them see that. That's right. Give me the press room, please. Trapping more travelers. The storm is rapidly moving south. The weather bureau predicts heavy showers late tonight and tomorrow. Make one for me on the rocks, would you? Double. Could get out of this if you wanted to. Who says I want to? I get a third of that ransom, you know. Sure. Just like the split on that car sale, huh? Well this time it'll be a lot different deal. You bet it will be. This time you're trading a robbery charge for the chair. Brother, you're really in the big league now. Big payoff, big stakes. None bigger, your life. We can take him unawares like he did me. I'll hit him and you go right for his gun. And suppose it misses fire? We'll both be shot full of more holes than a punchboard! We was talking about gamblin'. I always say don't worry none about the stakes. Take the odds with the big payoff, huh? At 3:25, a police technician disguised as a milkman spent a few hurried minutes at the Courtier house. We're sending you a special broadcast. Scrambled, so no one else can tune in. This gizmo will unscramble it. Please... Please tell me, what do you think my husband's chances are? Long as the right negotiations are cooking, we can keep him alive. What about that Greenlees case last year? What about that? They killed that little boy right away! I know. There are four channels not used in LA. 12's one of them, that's the one we're sending on. Gene's father's not even sure he can raise that kind of money in cash, and that quickly! Mrs. Courtier, these men have to be caught up with before the money's paid over. Michigan 5311. Extension 301. That's the police identification room. We're showing you the mugs who got Courtier. They'll give you instructions. Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Courtier. That's one of them, call the police quickly, tell them! Long distance. Hello, I want Lancaster 2343. Thank you. The call came through to Operator 502. Your number, please. Trinity 6301. The operator plugged into atoll switching trunk and dialed back Trinity 6301. She should have gotten a busy signal. This plugin signaled her supervisor the caller had given a phony number. This is the supervisor, Ms. Carter, may I help you? This is position call booth two and I have a call to the Lancaster number and the calling number doesn't check out. When you call the calling line I'll have it traced. All right. The operator then completed her Lancaster call but left the cord in the recording trunk. This held the connection open for tracing purposes, even if the caller hung up. 2343. Hello? This is Ms. Carter. Will you trace that front 126, please? Okay. Starting with the trunk number furnished by the supervisor, the switchman had to trace the call backwards through the network from selector to selector, each successively leading him to the incoming trunk, thereby establishing from which exchange the call originated. Aren't you overdoing it? The detective said to stall as long as I could, you heard him. Hello? Took you plenty long to answer. The money ready? I don't know! Gene's dad lives in LA, he's doing the best he can, but you must realize... I'll call him direct tonight, at his house. And that's your last call. Hello? We won't pay you a cent till we talk to Gene, not till we make sure he's all right! Hello, hello? He hung up. Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am, I'll tell him. Mrs. Courtier, he just hung up on her. That's all, type it up and send a copy to the Chief. What's taking your men so long? You ever see the exchange? Ever see the thousands of selectors for the job? Kidnappers are contacting the father tonight at his house. All right, have our men pick up Mrs. Courier 10 blocks from her house, I want him in Los Angeles, and both instructions when they hit town. - No chance of picking the guy up now. - Oh, not a prayer. The men from the press are here, dear. They're on the porch. All right, thank you. Tell them I'll be with them in a few minutes. Now can you fix it so the calls from the father-in-law's house are shuttled here? Yes, if it's in the same exchange area. Well if not, find a friend of the Courtier's who lives in that area, we'll move to his house. Fellas, we've got to pick up the kidnappers while they're phoning tonight or else! - Hello? - Who is it? Yeah, this is Cole. Wait just a minute. Call came from a drug store. Thrifty at six and Spring, it's one of their biggest. If they can find a witness in that Clambake who saw a guy making a phone call, it'll be a miracle. All right, which one of you fellas - went to the Courtier house? - Me sir, and I... All right, take it easy. I don't blame you for being teed off. Now boys, this man had a red hot tip, and I killed it. - Wait until my editor... - Now here it is. A man named Gene Courtier's been kidnapped. He's being held for 200 thousand dollars ransom. The first man that breaks in the paper or over the radio will cause Courtier's death just as surely as if he put a bullet in his head. How about me? How about you? You gypped me out of my exclusive, now you want me to twirl my thumbs while one of these double-crossing cutthroats makes a sucker out of me! It's news, and we have to print it. We've got a job to do. All right, men. There's a phone in that room. Who's first? Thanks, fellas. Thanks. I'll set up a special press room. If anything breaks, you'll get it immediately. Say Chief, do you think these kidnappers are really catching all the newscasters? I'm positive. Gotta hand it to you Chief... You know, that gives me an idea for my 11 o' clock newscast. Harold Jackson and Joseph Leer were today removed to the death chamber at San Quentin. They kidnapped Lenny Moscowitz in San Francisco on the 16th of January 1954, and although the victim was unharmed, the Little Lindbergh Law was invoked, and both men were nevertheless sentenced to die in the gas chamber. In this connection, it's interesting to note that the FBI has a phenomenal record of success. Since the passage of the federal kidnapping statute, it has investigated 453 cases of kidnapping, and of this total, 451 have been solved, and the other two are still under active investigation. In most of the cases solved, the courts agreed with the investigation, and the kidnappers have paid with their lives. To sum it all up, the devices of modern crime detection make it virtually impossible to collect a ransom and get away with it. Well, we have 187 units working. The whole town is blanketed. Captain and Mr. Courtier, may I see you for a moment please? - Excuse me, certainly. - Chief... You have the long distance factor. It's a rougher deal this time, you know that. How long will it take? - Depends on luck. - On luck? Well if the first selectors they look at leech off the right ones they face off in a few minutes. Otherwise it takes longer. Have you... Have you got all the men you can use? All we can possibly use. Any more, they'd be in each other's way. You understand that Gene's life is completely in your hands? I know that. Now I'm sure they won't call again. This is our one chance, our last chance. We have a direct line to the phone exchanges. They'll give us a blow-by-blow account. There's nothing, absolutely nothing we can do to help him. Both you and Gene's dad are on your own. But you've got to hold him until the switchmen trace the call. Or... That's it. Knowing that Doris could identify the Lincoln, he switched to a you drive car. A friend fixed up the radio to pick up police calls. That's what held him up. Why isn't he back by now? I want to take the drive to town and put in a lousy call. What is this? Aren't you getting a little edgy, bub? Maybe you need another drink. A nice stiff one. He's gonna be back from town in just a minute. Then it's gonna be too late. No. No, it's no go. What are you afraid of? Look, he's tough, plenty tough. The first blow, it's gotta KO him. - Shh, here he comes. - It's too dangerous! Come on inside. We was just talking about picking up broads. Guy can get a smack in the kisser. What's the matter with you? You're sweatin'. Look at your hand, you're shakin' like an old woman. Hey, what's going on? - We're caught if I have no gun on me. - What if we meet up with your boss? If we hear a car comin', we duck out of sight. Are we gonna run all the way into town? Look brother, we're in the crockpot. That guy's come to by now. Hey, just what the doctor ordered, fast wheels! Nice these buggies, that's my racket! The owner must be around someplace. He's probably neckin' with some dame. That ain't him, that car's black. Get in, it'll only take me a second to jump these wires. Going someplace? All right, get in Courtier. You're coming with me. You're gonna tell your wife everything is just dandy. When it rains in this town, it really rains. Well, that's a grim picture. You pick up anything suspicious, just holler. Stay here till I call ya. A light in the Brighton exchange was rigged to go on simultaneously with the call being placed over the phone. Sit there, hold it. The call terminated in this selector. It gave the switchmen the key to the preceding selector. Hey, 504A551. They had to find a selector that was hooked into the same circuit as the first one. There were 36 of them in bay 504. Each had to be examined until the right one was found. We can't stall much longer! Hello? I told you I wanted to speak to the old man. Oh, well, just a minute. Dad, Dad! 4039451. He's coming. They got the second digit. One more selector to check and we know the exchange. Hello? What took you so long? Have you got the dough? Well, it's quite a lot of money to raise so quickly, in cash. But I'll have it for you tomorrow. That's more like it. Now look, here's how I want it. 20 thousand in 503, 20 thousand in 203. The next selector was the vital one. Here it is, it's coming from the Dunkirk Exchange. I'll call the police radio room. I'll call the Dunkirk switch room. All bills must be old, unmarked, and not in sequence. The call came in to Brighton at the Dunkirk trunk. The Dunkirk boys have got the ball now. Pull it out a little more. Yes? Attention all special units, attention all special units. Move into section 11. 187 police units roared into section 11, code number for the Dunkirk exchange area. Attention all special units. Move into section 11. Hey! Hey! They're sending out one of those code area calls, all special units, what gives? Can't be us, how do they know where we are? Well make it snappy, will you? I Will. Now put all the money in a strong suitcase, force traps. I'm not sure I quite understand. Are you stalling? How about my talking to Gene? How about that? All right, come on, you! Hurry up! Make it fast. Hello? Oh darling, just to hear your voice... That's enough. Wait, wait! That might have been a recording. How can I be sure? Let me ask him just one question! All right, one question, one answer. Gene... What does May 29th, 1944 mean to you? May 29th? Yes, an emergency at 250 and 192. That's Dunkirk 73899. 3599 Heighton. All special units, all special units. Go to three RA. That was the day I proposed to you. Hey, another one of those special unit guys. Let's get goin', come on! Gene, Gene! Hello? Gene! Hello? Hello, hello? Hello? Darling! Honey, honey, you really threw me. I proposed to you on the 28th, not the 29th! Doris! Doris, are you all right? Hey, what's the matter? Gene, how many other men would have remembered?
