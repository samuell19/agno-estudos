I live in Allen, but, like, this was my hood. Like, I'’d come down here, and this is where all my boys were at. And this is also where I got into a lot of trouble. So right here this is a busy street, right? Up there is the target house. We'’d always have somebody in the parking lot that would keep a lookout. He had a cop scanner that we were able to buy off. At the time we knew all the cop codes, so we knew that whatever code that they pushed out, that'’s what it meant. It was either a robbery, it was a burglary, it was a fight, or whatever the deal is. So we always had a keen idea of where the cops were in the area. So down this street... ...would be a house that we would target, right? And so, we'’d have an extract point approximately about two blocks out, depending on if we were in disguise or not. So what we usually went with is electricians. We had buttoned some blue shirts, we got those ironed-on letters, and we'’d put TXU on our shirt. The leader, he did all the talking. And what he did was, he knocked on the door, and the lady opened the door, and he said, "Hi," you know, "we'’re from TXU," there was a transformer blowout in the neighborhood, and we needed to check your fuse box. So she allowed the three of us to go into her house, and we went over to the garage. Well, at that point, he had taken out a gun, and pointed it at her head and said that we'’re gonna kill you if you don'’t get down on the floor, so she got on the floor, we tied her up, and then I was assigned to the son, and my other partner was assigned to the daughter. And this is about nine o'’clock in the morning so they were both sleeping at that time. And so we walked to both of their rooms and then tied them up while they were sleeping and then grouped them up in one area. We put a pillow case over their head and gagged them so that way they wouldn'’t be able to talk. We were trying to get the combination to the safe and so we would take vases and smash them against the wall, and say that we were going to kill the son if she didn'’t give us the combination to the safe. She was extremely scared at that point, and with this particular job, we ended up taking upwards of $67,000. And so the idea of quitting did cross my mind but it was just so lucrative and seemed so easy at the time and it was something that we all did together that I knew I was never gonna stop. Until I got caught.

Nowadays Clyde would be a 7/11 bandit because he didn'’t like to rob banks. He said they gave you too much press. Okay, Bonnie would be a groupie, because she never killed anybody. But she would be a groupie so infatuated with Clyde and everything that she wouldn'’t turn loose. She followed him to death. My father was Ted Hinton. He was a deputy sheriff, and he and Bob Alcorn, they chased Clyde and Bonnie for 17 months. Ted had a saying that was two part. He said one, they were a couple of kids that fell in love after Clyde had fallen off the wrong side of the law fence. The other was that if those two kids had used their God-given gifts for legal endeavor, that they'’d have both been world-beaters. So, in other words, he was giving them the benefit of the doubt. [female #1] Who among us is the same person today that they were when they were 16 years old? When we look at teenagers, we always say, "What were they thinking?" And the answer is they probably weren'’t thinking. So we do need to come up with ways that-- or justice policies that recognize that people are capable of change. Being incarcerated definitely was a second chance in life. I mean, I will say this, I mean, a lot of times, as an inmate, you think that rehab is all BS, right? But the lessons that I'’ve learned in rehab I'’ve carried with me for the rest of my life, and one thing that I'’m grateful for is that I got to learn a lot about myself, and the reasons why I committed the crimes, and why I continued to commit them. And one thing that I thought was really sad or horrible about myself was that... I enjoyed it. I enjoyed having that power over somebody, putting somebody in a vulnerable situation, it gave me a thrill.

So I was 14 years old, I had a car and I went everywhere, from Frisco, Irving, Dallas, basically this whole area, anybody in my age group at the time, they knew me. I was the party guy. I used to hustle at my school. I had gotten fake IDs, and what I would do is I would buy alcohol and cigarettes and sell that to minors, and just generally got in with a bad group of people. Now things started getting really bad when I met a friend of mine here in Garland, and he introduced me to some people and we used to come down here to the Shaolin Temple all the time, we used to hang out. These guys, they were older and they were into more of the heavier types of crime. So at the time, I was street racing, I was selling here and there, but mostly minor stuff. They were into robberies. But because I felt such a strong connection with these guys, these guys were family to me, and I actually had placed the value of them over my own family, and so it was something that was kind of an easy decision for me. I just ended up being a part of it. [Dr. George Eichenberg] Eighty years ago, so many of the criminal gangs were regarded as folk heroes. Bonnie and Clyde, John Dillinger, these people captured national attention, and there were an awful lot of people who were, for lack of a better term, cheering them on. In many cases, they were robbing banks, and the people blamed the bankers for the economic mess to begin with. We have a serious problem with criminal gangs today, but for the most part these people are not regarded heroically. In fact, most people regard these folks with a great deal of fear and trembling.

And so at the time, you know, the Kia was right here, it was a green Kia. I was arrested right over there. I looked up over my car and that'’s where my mom showed up, right there, and she was in a blue robe. And that'’s just something that I'’ve always remembered. Like, you know, she maintained my innocence and tried to comfort me at that time, and it was right here in this spot. There was a police SUV that pulled up in that spot right there, there was another cop car that was in the driveway over there, at 749, and, yeah, immediately once I pulled in, they came out and arrested the crap out of me. [Dr. George Eichenberg] In the 1920s and '’30s, if I wanted to be a police officer, I went to the local police station and said, "Do you have an opening for a police officer?" If they liked the looks, they would give me a badge and a gun and tell me to come to work on the night shift that night. To be quite blunt, and I'’m not suggesting that the cops 80 years ago were bad guys or ineffective police officers, but there was no real professionalism. The story is, and I'’ve worked with some of those old guys who had started before and after World War II, kind of the bottom line was, if you really couldn'’t get a better job and you didn'’t mind getting in a fight and maybe crackin'’ a head once in a while, you could get a job as a police officer or sheriff.

When they arrested him, I was asking, "Where is he," I'’m gonna have to go pick him up when they finish questioning. I didn'’t think that it was that serious, because I don'’t know what he did at that time. I mean, what he did was probably pranks or something, you know, so I thought that they'’re going to question him and I'’m going to call, and then when he didn'’t come up-- didn'’t come home, and the next day I keep calling the police, I say, "What'’s going on now, can I go pick up my son?" That'’s when the real fear set in. Prison to me is like hell. It'’s the most frightening thing to me. I mean, he may get hurt, fights and everything. Or he may join a gang.

[somber guitar music] ♪ ♪ [female #2] The prison industrial complex in Texas is very much rooted on how do we continue to make money off of human beings by making them criminals. You have to remember how Texas began, and became so heavily dependent on the prison industrial complex. It really goes even further back to the days of slavery. What Texas did and other states did, they created vagrancy laws, meaning that if you'’re out there, you'’re a "freed person," quote, unquote, but you can'’t get a job then you become a vagrant and that'’s a criminal offense. So they implemented policies to make them seem as criminals so that they can continue to utilize their labor, they can continue to exploit them for the sake of, you know, their financial wealth. [Buddy Barrow] Eastham Prison Farm was where Clyde was incarcerated, and it was a very brutal place. It was already labeled as one of the most traumatic death places you'’d ever wanna go, that a human being would suffer, you know? It wasn'’t just the convicts that were... it was the guards. The guards would just kill you for no reason. [L.J. Hinton] He went to the pen on relatively minor charges, of burglary, theft, such as that, and car theft, okay. First killing he ever did was in the penitentiary. A building tender sodomized him, and Clyde sneaked a piece of pipe in. Clyde proceeded to comb his hair with that piece of pipe, and a trustee was standing there, he saw it. He took the pipe away from Clyde and told him, said, "You didn'’t see anything, you didn'’t hear nothin'. You don'’t know nothin'. It'’s your wreck." That was Clyde'’s first killing and he never did get the credit for that. Prison has become a school for crime. We know that it makes people worse. It teaches them skills, it makes them angry in ways that they maybe had not been before. Bonnie and Clyde may be perfect examples of that, where they never should have been in there in the first place, and if their issues had been addressed, and they hadn'’t been exposed to rape or other types of traumatic treatment, maybe these future crimes would never have happened. [Jason] Oh, no, some girl gave me that. [unintelligible speaking] [Jason] Yeah, they'’re all pretty big in here. Evins was just a really hard facility to be in. It was a very gang-oriented facility. Basically at that point, the gangs had won the facility. I remember one time, I got into a fight with a kid, and I got caught, and I was a high phase at the time, they fired me from my job, they fired me from everything, took away my phases, took away all my privileges, and I'’m just stuck on the dorm, and that'’s probably one of my lowest points. And because I had very limited contact with my mom, I just didn'’t have any outlet, I didn'’t have anybody to really go to. At that point I had thought that, you know, maybe the rest of my life is gonna be in the prison system, and it'’s hard because there'’s a very fine balance that you have to--that you have to kind of tread on because if you, you know, act positive and get too many privileges, well, now you have beef from everybody, right? But then you also have to, like, act bad to a certain point so that way you don'’t cause problems on the dorm with other kids, right? And so, yeah, that was the point where I thought, you know, hey, I'’m just gonna give up. I'’m gonna join a gang, you know? I'’m gonna do drugs, I'’m gonna get into fights. Like, who cares, you know? Like, I didn'’t see a future at that point. ♪ [male #5] We have a variety of programming options. Every youth goes through a 30 to 45 day orientation session.

We'’ve built till we'’re blue in the face. We'’ve added 100,000 prison beds during the '’90s and 2000s, and you know, we found that it made us poorer but not necessarily safer. What started happening in the early 2000 period was that we realized that we couldn'’t keep affording these policies we put in place. ♪ ♪ [male #6] It started for me in January of 2005. The Speaker calls me in one day and says, "You'’re Chairman of Corrections." You know, I of course thank the Speaker of the House when he does that, you know, he'’s just made you chairman of a committee, an important committee. You say, "Thank you, Mr. Speaker," and under my breath, I'’m saying to myself, "Oh God, why me? What did I do to deserve this?" Then I asked him, "Well, Mr. Speaker, what do you want me to do?" And he gave me the eight words that changed my life, and changed a lot of the system, and that is, "Don'’t build new prisons, they cost too much." So if you had that situation, okay, what are you gonna do? I--well, I started lookin'’ around and found that there was one democratic senator who I'’d known but had never really done a bill with, never been on a committee with, named John Whitmire. Whitmire is in the other political party than I am. We sat down and we started talking. We started investigating the whole criminal system of where does the--you know, how do you break the cycle? And there'’s only two things you can really do: one, you could open the door and let prisoners out, or two, you could figure out a way to slow '’em down coming in. Well, we quickly figured out in Texas that opening the door and letting '’em out would probably be about as popular as it would be some other places. If you let the really bad guys out, you'’re really going to endanger your population. You don'’t wanna do that, okay? So we said, okay, that'’s out. We'’re gonna go look at the other side: How do you slow '’em down coming in? What can you do with people so that they don'’t either come to prison to start with, or don'’t return if they'’ve been there? You know the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, obviously we have a charge to maintain the public safety, but it also has another charge: to employ effective rehabilitation techniques and programs to reduce recidivism. If people are going in and out, in and out, we'’re not being successful. So I don'’t think it'’s necessarily a republican or democratic issue, because at the end of the day it'’s about people. And I believe at least Clyde started out as a juvenile delinquent, and the idea that on the juvenile end, we want to make sure that we don'’t lock our children when they do make that criminal mistake.

I haven'’t been enrolled into the capital offender program yet, but hopefully very soon I will be, and I'’m looking forward to that experience as well. I expect to figure out really where I had messed up and how I can change that way of thought that I had to make a better person out of me, and to improve in life. [somber music] [unintelligible conversation] ♪ [female #3] This is actually the capital offender building. It'’s not an impressive building, but it'’s actually the work that takes place inside the building that creates the magic and the mystique surrounding the program. And it'’s essentially just a very plain room where students feel very safe and feel free to express all of the feelings that they'’ve held onto for a number of years but were maybe oftentimes too embarrassed or didn'’t know how to share them. We expose them to who they really are. Because a lot of the time, they will spend most time blaming their behaviors on everything else around them. They'’re either situational, or somebody else did something to them, but then in here we really focus on them and who they are and why they developed the way they developed. We may have quite a few students who have histories of their fathers and their grandfathers being committed for murder. And so once we start to look at those patterns and then they realize, like, wow, this really isn'’t the most normal background, then they start to be more introspective and looking inside themselves and figuring out. And then one of the big parts really is when we start-- when we have their peers asking them a lot of questions and they realize that, wow, my life really wasn'’t normal. And then we start to discuss, okay, so what would a normal life look like? And some of them really don'’t have a clue what a normal childhood is like because they'’ve had so much trauma, so we work through the trauma and we work through lots of different things like that. This is just an example of some of the things that they do. You know, this might have been... Right, this here has no name on it, so... Victims, and, you know, this student was obviously asked how many victims they had, and his age. As you go down to 15, look at how it'’s grown. And so that kind of makes them realize, wow, look at how many people you were victimizing. And victims are not necessarily just the people that they might have physically hurt, but if I'’m in here or if the police are always coming to my house, and my mom has to deal with those, now my mom is a victim also. As you can see the walls here, these walls could talk, you know, because we actually use the walls to put papers up where they write up the significant events from their earliest childhood memory, and it could be, "I started selling drugs at the age of seven," you know, things of that nature. But the walls, when they get really mad at themselves, they'’ll punch the walls, which is why we have so many dents. But we also use these walls to put pins in them, for, like I said to you earlier, crime scene pictures, you know, pictures sometimes of autopsies, because we want them to-- you know, a lot of the time, they say, "my victim, my victim, my victim," and we want them to understand that their victim wasn'’t just a victim, it was a person, so your victim had a name. What was your victim'’s name? So if your victim'’s name is Brian, we encourage them to say Brian. Brian was this age, Brian had two or three brothers or sisters, and we want them to understand it, the difference between just being the victim and actually having a life and a purpose, and goals and dreams, and then that'’s when it really starts to impact them, like, man, this kid was just like me. And, you know, it kind of-- and then they get angry, sometimes they'’ll throw chairs around, but they also know that it'’s better to do all of that in here, in a safe environment. And the peers that are working with them will hold them. They'’ll hug them, they'’ll all cry together, they'’ll--and then they'll go back to their dorms. ♪ [chorus] ♪ Bonnie ♪ ♪ Bonnie and Clyde ♪ Oh, Bonnie ♪ ♪ Bonnie and Clyde ♪ [laughing] ♪ ♪ Lots of untruths to these write-ups ♪ ♪ They are not so ruthless as that ♪ ♪ ♪ Their nature'’s raw and they hate all the law ♪ ♪ The stool pigeons and the spotters ♪ ♪ And the rats [male #8] Oh my God, Jason!

So, the Capital and Serious Violent Offender Program, it'’s the only program in the entire world that works on rehabilitating youth that committed violent crime. So we'’re talking about capital murder, or murder, or aggravated robbery, aggravated assault, so a bunch of crimes that were very violent in nature. And so what we do is we go through the life cycle, the offense cycle, and then the success plan. And so the first step is that you will actually commit the crime in, like, a play area, right? So, we'’re in this room, and they give us props to use as a gun or to use to tie somebody down. And somebody will play the victim, and you will commit your crime again, reenact that crime. And then they switch it around, and then they make you the victim, where you'’re the person that'’s being assaulted or being murdered or whatever it may be. So it'’s extremely intensive.

She was the lady that owned the café where the museum is now, where Bonnie and Clyde bought their last meal. Sometimes it'’s just nice to get away from Dallas. But, no, I like coming down here, I'’ve met people from all over the world. It'’s a way of learning more about the history of Bonnie and Clyde. It'’s just a fascinating story, and it'’s almost more fascinating to see the people who are fascinated by it. A normal week lately, I'’ve been doing probably three or four tours a week, and then in between all of that, I'’m out serving papers to people who don'’t wanna. [laughs] The economy is a big reason why I'’m doing what I'm doing now. The economy was bad, but for me, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise that I was able to find something that I love to do. I enjoy what I do, and, you know, there'’s not a lot of people who can say that about their work. As far as courage goes, you know, you have to do what you have to do. I'’m not saying that, you know, you go out and rob banks like Bonnie and Clyde did, but I have found that I did have a courage that I didn'’t know I had before. I have a strength that I didn'’t realize I had before, and it'’s simply because you either sink or you swim, and thank goodness I know how to swim. [Dr. George Eichenberg] Whenever you have an economic downturn, a year, two years, perhaps three years later you start to see a slight increase in crime overall. Some of it'’s property crime, because people are committing property crimes in order to live, but then along with that, people are under more stress because they'’re out of work, the bills are piling up. Some people turn to alcohol as a means of dealing with that stress, and high stress and someone consuming large amounts of alcohol is always a bad thing and almost invariably leads to some type of violent acting out. The Depression had already hit probably in the mid-early '’20s. You know, you always heard about the roaring '’20s, when they were going with Prohibition. There was a reason why they was making this whisky, you know, it was generatin'’ an income because there was no income. So people would swap for different things, like I got water, you need meat, you know, I got eggs, you need chickens, so that'’s what they did, and that'’s how these people lived. And it was just one big community of people who were destitute, who had no other income and they had to survive. And this is where a lot of '’em went to robbery. They say you never break the law unless you get caught. Well, there was a lot of '’em that didn'’t get caught. Clyde was unfortunately one that got caught. [female #4] When Clyde was in Texas Department of Criminal Justice, it was not the same. You basically had rule to do whatever you wanted to, and now we don'’t do that. We make sure that, you know, we have people on board and people at hand, we have grievance policies, and we have different procedures established to make sure that everybody is okay. So what Clyde went through years ago, we all saw this on television, so what he went through, none of that today. Now the classes are in prison and they'’re out here, in parole, on parole. So on either side, you still have classes coming in so we can help stop that. The first three months is like the honeymoon period, and they'’re excited, they'’re wanting to take however many classes we give them. You know, they'’re just happy to be out. So, a lot of times, if you can get this good information in them, their mindset is different. People coming up so that they could say, "Hey, sign up for this so we can get you a job, we can make sure that you'’re working." A lot of times if they'’re workin'’ and they're busy, they don'’t have time to go out there and break laws. But we do have certain people who don'’t want change, and that'’s where, you know, the enforcement comes. I mean, because you tell us what you want from us, and so now we'’re trying to make sure we have you rounded, you know, not just locking you up and throwing you back in prison, no. We want to make sure you'’re okay when you come out. [male #9] There'’s no secrets to parole. Everything you'’re responsible for as a person on parole under supervision was on the front of that parole certificate and on the back of that parole certificate. No surprises. We'’re not about just lock '’em back up anymore, we'’re about helping. If you'’ve been on parole, you know what your responsibilities are. If you'’re new to parole, I would take it that you'’re intelligent enough that you can read, that if you don'’t understand something, you'’re capable of asking a question to get an understanding of what your responsibilities are. You have what I call the dos and the don'’ts. You do these two things, you don'’t do these two things. You can be successful. When I was released, admittedly I was very scared, '’cause I did not feel that... I was prepared to take on the world. I felt that I had fallen behind in my education, because of the opportunities that everybody else had, that I'’d just be at the bottom of the bucket. And I just didn'’t feel prepared. I had to learn how to drive all over again. Pay bills, you know, just kind of, you know, come back to a home where I could have freedom to wake up and take a shower when I want to. So it was a fear of kind of like the unknown. When I came home, I remember that my mom drove me up to the front door and she told me to stay in the car, and then she went into the house, and then she was doing something and then came back out, and then she led me slowly inside and the whole house is dark but we had candles all over the place, and she had my bed made and everything. -It was at night. -Yeah. And it was just--it was the craziest feeling. '’Cause I was free.

He even moved as far as Minnesota and Wisconsin, and got him a job up there, but he missed his family too much so he came back and had a job, but every time something happened in Dallas, a robbery or a murder, they always wanted to question Clyde because he was an ex-con. The wouldn'’t take him back home. They just let him out, and he had to walk all the way back to West Dallas from Downtown Dallas, which is a pretty good little walk. So he would get about halfway home, two other detectives would pick him up. Now he just said, "Hey, I just left there." They said, "We got questions that we want to ask you," so they'’d load him up, took him back downtown, and they did this time, time, time again.

So--and has even overpaid her portion. And, you know, you heard her say earlier she works at Pizza Hut down the street, so that job pays what, $8, $9 an hour.

Texas has actually taken a lead in trying to reduce the size of its juvenile justice system. Just a few years ago, in 2007, we had almost 5,000 kids who were locked up in state secure institutions, essentially juvenile prisons, although we don'’t call them that. Now, we'’re down to about 1,100. So it'’s been a remarkable drop in the juvenile population that'’s incarcerated. The way that that'’s happened is by investing a lot more heavily in community-based programs and services, most of which are nonresidential. We put the money into probation services, and the communities are identifying what their needs are and how they want to spend the money to address the children'’s needs.

My experience is, and we started, you know, I'’ve been going through this on and off for six years, and our introduction into it here in Dallas County was horrid. You know, sometimes I think, okay, if adults were treated the same way that kids are, maybe there wouldn'’t be so many adults in the system. But then, if you look at each individual child, such as mine, who had emotional issues, learning disabilities, and things such as that, they have people who are qualified to do that stuff, they have the training to help those kids, but I think a lot of them have become so jaded that they don'’t give it all they have. My son, for example, it was determined because of his disabilities that he would never be able to complete the program that they had set for the kids to have to complete before they were eligible for release. So they just pushed him through the system and let him go. He ended up back there. And again, you know, it was his fault that he did, but nothing I saw there prepared him to cope once he got out.

I like to think that I'’ve changed, and I try not to go back. I was a first-time offender with a good record. You know, I was going to school, I was making As, I was doing community service, I went to church. And this is the first crime I had ever committed, and they gave me a 12 year sentence. And when I was incarcerated, I met people that had murdered other people and gotten three year sentences or eight year sentences. There was one guy in particular that I remember, he was high at the time, he was high on drugs, and he had picked up a shotgun and he thought that it wasn'’t loaded, and he pointed it at his girlfriend'’s face and pulled the trigger as a joke. But it was loaded and he blew her face off, right? And she died on the spot, and he only got three years. So, there'’s a huge mix. [Michele Deitch] Unlike many states, we have what are described as wide-open sentence ranges. For example, for a first degree felony, which is the most serious felony, someone could receive a sentence anywhere from five years to 99 years, or a life sentence, or probation. So it runs the entire gamut. And the reason we have those kind of wide-open ranges here is because, well, for a few reasons. One is that we believe in jury sentencing. Texas is one of just a few states in the country that allows juries to decide on the sentence, and because we believe that the community should be able to express its views about the seriousness of an offense through the sentencing range, we want to give them as much discretion as possible. The other factor is that not all crimes are the same. You can have two murders that are very, very different. The person who kills their abuser is very different than the serial murderer.

Even though the crime rate has been going down throughout the years in Texas-- in all different crimes it has gone down-- you know, we don'’t necessarily just want to measure it by crime going down, we want to measure it by how healthy communities are. Whether or not the kids are staying with their parents, whether or not the parents have the tools they need to be good parents, whether or not the people who suffer from addiction are treated the way that they should, which is a mental and substance abuse--like a health concern, not a criminal justice concern, you know? And making sure that, if they do end up in the system, that they have the tools that they need to live responsibly. We still have a long way to go.

And he had to do it to stay alive. And that'’s the reason why law enforcement had to find a way because they wasn'’t gonna live like that. Now you have to remember that of the 12 people that the Barrow gang killed, nine of '’em were police officers. And Ted said that... he knew what his detail was, what his job was, knew that he was supposed to bring him in alive if possible, but take no chances. He said what worried him was the fact that there was a possibility of either he or Bob Alcorn might become number 10 or 11 of police officers killed. Clyde was never captured from the time he ran. He started in 1932 and he ended in 1934, not by capture but by ambush. They killed him on the spot.
