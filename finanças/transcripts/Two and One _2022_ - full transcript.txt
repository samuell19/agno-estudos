Hop in! There's room for everyone! Come on. Hop in! We got more seats! More seats! Seriously? Do I look like a mugger? Oh, you're not? Thank god! Come on. A guy as good-looking as me? Nope. That's why I thought you were. Ouch! That hurts. So, what are you? A call boy? Woah! That's so judgemental of you. You're right. What are you up for? Nothing. I just want to go home in one piece. Don't you want to do it here? Wait, are you serious? You're crushing my ego into bits. - Am I really that ugly to you? - I didn't say that. I knew it. You find me cute. Don't deny it. It's quite obvious. Fine. You're kind of cute. Kind of? Don't beg for more. Just be thankful. Okay, chill. So... So? Are you up for it? Come on! Let's cross it off on our bucket list. So you think that outdoor fun is on my bucket list? Come on! It's not? Even in your imagination? Not even in my dreams. Okay. If you say so. So, if you don't want to do it here, how about in my place, or yours? Your call. Sorry. I'm just not into that right now. I need to go home. That sucks. I'm sure you'll find someone else. I was supposed to meet somebody else but I got catfished. I got stuck in traffic. What a waste of time. My car won't even start. Bummer! You deserve it. Are you mocking me? I thought I got some consolation by sitting beside a cute guy in the bus. Only to find out he's a bully. Me? A bully? What if I'm having a bad day too? You mean someone else has it worse? I got catfished. My car broke down. Then you dumped me. I've had it worse. I failed my licensure exam. I'm sorry. We're near the bus stop! I gotta get off. Alright. Take care. You, too. Hop in! There's room for more! - Are you out of your mind?! - Sorry! It's a matter of life and death. Did you forget something? Yes. You. Me? Fuck love. That's enough. Go home before I drag you out of here. You're a heartless prick. I get that a lot. Damn it! How to be heartless? How to be you? Unfortunately, this lifestyle is not for everyone. I don't have empathy to begin with. I doubt that you can survive being alone. Don't you feel lonely? Why would I? If you can do it, I can do it, too. It's better said than done. Look at you, drowning your sadness in alcohol. Why don't you think of ways to win back Chan? But he wouldn't take me back. He doesn't want me anymore. - Happy Monthsary! - Hi! What monthsary? It's been six months since you flirted with me in the bus. I don't do monthsaries. So it's been six months since you called me ugly. Stop saying that. I'm sure that I didn't call you ugly. That's your karma. Now you're head over heels for an "ugly" guy. Silly. Let's meet already so I can pinch you. When are you coming back to the city? You're just moping around. Excuse me? I'm studying for my licensure exam retake. Why don't you visit me here? And watch you read books? Why not? You don't want to be a lawyer, neither an accountant. So what are you studying for? There's a... You have a way out. You can choose any profession you want. Weighing your options is different from walking away. Besides, my dad has his eyes on me. I don't have a choice. Weighing your options or... Tino, please stop tempting me. Just saying. But if ever you'd run off with me, I'd gladly join you. And become my responsibility? Where would I even hide you? First of all, you're rich. You have stocks and investments. Second, you can take me anywhere. Take me to where I won't feel that I'm a disappointment. Maybe you just need to relax a little bit. Look at your eyebags. You look so tired. But I do feel relaxed whenever we talk. That's good. Hang on. Someone's outside. I'll call you back. Welcome home, Elaine. Is Tino there? I'll talk to him. Tino, your mother is here. What are you doing here? Tino, I know it's hard to understand, but listen to me. Don't tell me you're back together. You might think I've lost my mind but I have thought about this. Your mother and I talked about this. We both decided that we owe it to ourselves to give our relationship another chance. What? I'd rather move out! Tino, please! I need you. Hi! What happened? I had a fight with my mom. Why? What happened? I can't live here anymore. Did she kick you out? Where are you going? Anywhere far from here. Hold on. Calm down. Take a seat. Do you want to talk about it? No. But do you want to come with me? Huh? You want to run off with me, right? Because you wanna get out of there. Come on! Let me take you. Wait a sec. Are you serious? Maybe this is a sign for us to start over. Christian? Son, are you busy? Kinda. Why, mom? Your dad is on his way home. He's with Thomas. Is it okay if your brother sleeps in your room? Sure. Alright. I'll tell your dad. Sure. So where are we going? You're coming with me? Isn't that what you want? Yes! You're right. I probably need a break. And besides... I'm dying to hug you. ♪ You brought me ♪ ♪ To a serene world ♪ ♪ We're always happy ♪ ♪ And free from troubles ♪ Let's do pottery when we get there. Come on!

My moms love watching movies from the '60s, that's why. '60s is too old. I was from the '80s to early '90s. Had I not retired, I could've lasted until early 2000s. Since you recognized me, I'll give you a discount. Thank you. I'm generous like that. And I'm an ally, too. I support people like you. You're human beings, too, right? - Just call me if you need help. - Alright. The room is all yours. Do whatever you want. - Bye! - Thank you!

What do you think? Are you ready? Hey! Wait! I should've ended it when I had the chance. I should've run away before I fell deeply in love with him. But you didn't. You hate commitments but you had a relationship with him. I didn't want to. But Chan... Chan was the only exception. Upper body first... Ready... And ready. Go up. And then bend your knees. And go up! You're better than him, sir. You're a fast-learner. - There. Okay? - There you go! Bend your knees. Let's see. Just look straight and go up. There you go! You're such a fast-learner, sir! What if you fall? If you fall? Just cover your head and land on your butt. Did you hear that? Land on your butt. Catch me. This is probably the craziest thing I've ever done. Which one? To surf? Nope. I'm an obedient child, you know. I don't want to rush into things without having a solid plan. Don't blame me if we run out of food or we become homeless, okay? Or we could just sell our videos online. What do you think? You wish! Seriously, what happened to your parents? Let's not talk about them. Look at the gorgeous view. This is so good. It's getting hot in here. The sun is up. Just like your dick. It's your fault. You're sexy. And you can do all sorts of things on this body. Except penetration. Yeah. We need to talk about that. Why? Is it a dealbreaker? I don't know. I'm not sure yet. But if we want our relationship to be official, we need to figure out our sex life, right? What do you mean "official"? You know what I mean. Nope. Care to explain? You already know it. Maybe I gambled too hard and I lost. So you think you're the only one who gambled? He knew what he was getting into. Everything that happened to us was his choice, too. Chan, where are you going? Chan! But I know we were happy. We were happy. Our relationship wasn't perfect, but we were okay. What do you want me to say? I didn't expect we'd meet again. Tino, we talk every single day. Yes, it was just video call, but I thought it meant something. Of course, it meant something. So you mean what we have isn't official? God, Chan! It's not that serious! Well, I'm serious. Am I giving up everything for something that's not serious? I went with someone I don't know. How stupid of me? Wait! Wait. Did I force you to go with me? I'm sorry. I guess it's my fault for not asking questions. Fine. Let's get it out of the way. I have never been in a serious relationship before. But I know that when it comes to compatibility, sex is very important. So yes, it's a dealbreaker for me. I survived the last six months because of you. You make me happy when you listen to my stories... when you listen to my rants. At the back of my head, I knew it's too good to be true. I really wanted it to be true. You know what I'm feeling right now? It's like waking up from a perfect dream. Really? Yes. What do you what to happen then? I want to go home. That's what you want? Then go home. I don't know how we got to this point. He was the only person I truly cared about. I hope he felt that. Are you okay? Yes, I am. I just lost my balance. Slowly. Okay, I'm good. Ouch! Thanks, sir. Thanks, sir. Is this for real? You're leaving just because we had a fight? Chan, please don't go. Please stay. - Sorry. - It's alright. It's okay. Chan... Why? Your teeth... Sorry. It's okay. Chan, Chan... It's okay. I'm good. - I'm sorry. I'm not used to doing it. - It's fine. - I used to have braces. - It's okay. Why? Do you want to fuck me? Are you sure? Yes. Stop, stop. Stop. It's just that... I'm sorry. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Let's try again? Yeah. Okay. Chan, Chan... Are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let's just jerk off? Are you coming? Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Slowly. Almost there. Wow! Let me have this. My boyfriend is such a gentleman. Take your seat. Thank you. Not just a gentleman, but also a sweet lover. The type that you'd introduce to your parents. That's the goal. How about me? Will you introduce me to your parents? Am I really that bad that you still have to think about it? It's not you. It's my parents. That's new. Are they not accepting? Not really. They are not the problem. I think it's me. What do you mean? I already told you that I was adopted, right? I just want to return my parents' love. It's better to introduce someone to your parents when you're already accomplished. But you were a consistent honor student, right? You even graduated with the highest honors. I'm sure they're proud of you. I hope so. I am proud of you. I have a crazy idea. Shoot. Never mind. Forget it. Just say it, or I won't be able to sleep. - It's nothing. Never mind. - Come on. What is it? What's bothering you? Okay, fine. I'm just wondering... Are you open for an occasional third? I'm not sure I got that right. Okay. Would you be open to a... threesome? No... I don't know. I mean... I know what a throuple is. But I don't think it's for me. No, no. We don't need to have a relationship with the other guy. It's just pure hook up. Of course, with a stranger. We won't be doing it frequently. I don't know... Once... Twice... Or thrice a month? Just so we could get off. I don't know. It never crossed my mind. It's fine. It's okay. It's just an idea. A crazy idea. It's okay. Do you have a crush on me? Silly! Then why are you staring at me? Yes? Yes? Fine. I'm considering it. Considering what? You already know it. Just say it. Your proposal. That thing you wanted to try. That we'll get into an open relationship. For real? But we should set some rules, okay? Of course! We are not going to date other people. We are just going to fuck them. We should do it together and both of us should like the guy. Wow. Seems like you've already figured this out. Of course. There ought to be some boundaries. Right. I'm okay with this one. Nope. Come on! This one? I'm sure you like this type. No. What's your type? Hunk? Twink? Jock? Bear? Chub? Otter? Effem? I don't know. I'll tell you once I find a match. - Okay? - Okay. Hi! What took you so long? I just bought something. What's that? Take a guess. Food. Did you swim? I thought you went for a jog? Nope. I have something to tell you. I bumped into this gorgeous surfer while I was jogging on the beach. And then I fell that's why I got wet. Gorgeous? Who's gorgeous? Aren't you going to ask if I'm okay? You look fine. What? Jealous? Why would I be jealous? I'm sure I'm better-looking. You haven't even met him. You even find it hard to pick a guy from the dating app. If he's on the app, then I'm good with him. For real? You're okay with him? Who's this guy, anyway? He gave me his number. Do you want to meet him? Sure. Let's do that so we can prove that I'm the better-looking guy. Let's eat? What's this? It's not that painful. Stop complaining. We're almost there. I know. Are we here? Joaquin? Hey! You made it! You made it! I thought we got lost. This is Tino, my boyfriend. Boyfriend. I see. Nice meeting you, Tino. I'm Joaquin. It's dirty. Okay. So, wanna come in? Let's go? Let's go. Okay. Let's go. You want egg? - I'm good. - Alright. It doesn't just look good, it also tastes good! I get that a lot. We're still talking about the food, aren't we? Of course. So about pottery... is it your hobby or your business? Both, actually. I accept made-to-order pots. I only take orders if I want to. I don't want to feel pressured with the demands. I get what you mean. How long have you been into pottery? I've been meaning to do it but I couldn't find the time. I don't have time for hobbies. I don't usually do protégés. But since you're both cute, I'll make an exception. - Really? - Yeah. - You'll teach us? - Yeah. Go teach Chan. I am not into that kind of stuff. Why? I'll look forward to that, Joaquin. Sure. But I'll ask something in return. That's all you got? Now, this is the party. You like it? You feel good? Fuck. Hey, hey. - Wait. - What? Fuck me. Shit. Sorry. I feel good. Fuck! You good? It's good? Go for it! So hot! Good thing you're back. What's wrong? You have a visitor. She said she's your relative so I let her in. She arrived the other night. Go ahead and see her. I'll go play mahjong. Wish me luck! Bye. Thank you. Let's go? I have no idea. Who could it be? Tino! Tino! Tino! - Tino! - What are you doing here? How did you know I'm here? I saw your post online. I also asked around. Isn't it obvious why I left? Can't you respect my decision? I understand why you're furious. Then good! Because I'm not going with you. - Tino. - Tino. Tino. I'm not asking you to come home. I just want you to talk to your mom. You should patch things up. She's been drinking again. And you're blaming me for it? When you're the reason why she became an alcoholic! I was there when you left us to be with a man. I was there when she was heartbroken. I was there! I'd pick her up in random bars because she was so drunk and wasted. I'd clean her up. I was there since I was a teenager. I know. You do? Then why did you abandon me? If you want to be with mom again, then you should accept that side of her. You're just starting out again and yet you're already giving up? Believe it or not, I love your mom. Get out of my life. Please. That's what you get from running away. Lucky you, your bad deeds aren't chasing you. I won't deny it, I'm no saint. But I never ran away. Don't compare me with you. I was honest with my ex-wife. I wasn't running away from anyone. I came here to live life as I want to. - But you also hurt other people, right? - But I'm not an asshole like you. Fuck, okay! Fine! I'm an asshole! Yes! You're an asshole so enough with your excuses. Blame those bullshit excuses for feeling miserable. You talk like you're not at fault. Well, it's not my fault that you're drowning yourself in alcohol. I don't get why my mother had to come. So it's her fault now? Why? Am I wrong? Do you think I chose to be an asshole? She just had to ruin everything. She was only thinking of herself. It's all about her and her own fucking happiness. When my mother left us, I only cried once because if mom saw me crying, it would've devastated her. Damn, it was hard. The first few months was hard. Until she moved on. And I moved on, too. We were okay. We were happy. Until my mother came back to ruin everything again. Are you okay? Yeah. Are you sure? You can talk to me about it. I'm fine. Just cuddle me. Hello! Come in. I'm sorry, it's quite messy. Thank you. Please take a seat. Let's just wait for Tino. He's out for a surfing lesson. But he's still recovering from sprain. Let him be. The more you stop him, the more he'll resist. - I'll just call him. - No need! I just want to make sure that he's okay. It's good that I met you. The truth is, we're still adjusting. That's normal. Her Mommy Hazel once told me that Santino is allergic to relationships. That's why I was surprised when I met you. It's probably our fault. Maybe we're not good role models for him. Maybe that's also the reason why his first boyfriend cheated on him. First boyfriend? Yes. When he was a teenager, he dated a much older guy. It happened while Hazel and I were preoccupied with our own problems. And when we found out, it was too late. Tino was traumatized. He didn't tell me about it. He only talks about it with his mom. And I understand why he is indifferent towards me. Anyway, I'm sorry for taking your time. It's fine. I'm just reviewing for an exam. You mean, a licensure exam? Yes. I'm also a Certified Public Accountant! Good luck! You can do it! I really hope so. I think that's stress. When I was in college, I cope through meditation. You want me to teach you? I'm tired of all your excuses. What? I'm trying my best here to be on your side. But all you're saying is it's Chan's fault, it's your mom's fault, it's your mother's fault, it's the whole world's fault why you're miserable. You have a choice, and you choose not to forgive. It was your choice to let Chan leave you. It was your choice to be an asshole. Tino. Tino! What? Are you mad at me? What do you think? I told you I don't want to talk about them. But you even cozied up to my mother. Tino, she was just helping me out. What's wrong with that? I don't know what you're going through because you're not telling me. I hate this. All this drama. You need to be a little bit more delicate. Not too hard but not too soft. Am I doing it right? Yeah. Okay. Now... try pressing the center with your thumb. Joaquin, what the hell?! - What? - What's wrong with you? I'm sorry. You smell good. I can't help it. Can we focus, please? No. Forget it. Let's just fuck. - Let me make this clear. - Okay. I am only going to do it with you when we're with Tino. Okay? Because? Because? I thought this is consented cheating. What? No one's cheating here. No one? Joaquin, if you want to say something, just say it. You know. I'm not the jealous type. I can share you with him. I tried to seduce Chan. I thought I could charm him but I was wrong. But you, you have a chance. He cares a lot about you. You just have to make up your mind on what really matters to you. Should we call Joaquin? What is it this time? Does he really have to be here when we're having sex? - I thought you're okay with it? - Yes, I am. I thought you're enjoying it. So, do we need to ask for Joaquin's permission before we have sex? Why don't we let him decide for our relationship? Chan. Chan, please. I don't want to argue. That's what I ran away from. Please, let's not fight. No, let's fight over this! So I don't feel dismissed for once. What do you mean? I don't want to make a big deal out of this. Fuck! This is why I hate relationships. There's too much drama. This is not just drama. I want to fix our relationship, that's why. I love you and I will never hurt you. Unlike your ex-boyfriend. What did you say? Did my mother tell you that? Do you think you're doing me a favor? You know nothing about my past! - I said... - Shut up! Shut up. Tino? Chan called me. Good thing I found you here. What happened? Can we talk this time? What are you doing here anyway? Didn't I tell you to leave?! But I promised your mom that I will fix this. Don't you think it's too late for that? I was so thankful when you and mom broke up. You were always fighting and bickering. I thought I was the only reason why you stayed together. Whatever your mom and I went through, has nothing to do with you. Yes, that's why you left me, because your boyfriend didn't want me in your life! You abandoned me. - Because your mama needed you... - I needed you! I'm sorry. But son, I'm here now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. I deserve to be alone. At least I won't be able to hurt anyone. If anything, I know it's possible because of you. Fuck it. Do you really have to make me your role model? I mean... Come on. It's not such a bad idea to not give a fuck. It seems fun... It's fun to not commit. When you're not responsible for someone else's feelings but your own. Coming. It's you. Disappointed? Okay. I will answer one of your questions. I'm only human. I get sad, I get happy, I get afraid, and I get angry. I wish I could share those feelings with someone. I wish I had someone to celebrate with. But I'm over it. So over it. It's hot. It's hot. What are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? Just pretend that I'm Chan, okay? I'm Chan. Fuck! Who the fuck is that?! Tino! Wake up. Tino! Wake up. Take a shower. Go! It's up to you. Wake up. Coming! I said I'm coming, damn it! - Is Tino here? - Hey Chan! What a surprise! Chan... Chan, wait! Chan.. Chan, wait.. Calm down. Chan, calm down, please. Please, can we not resort to violence? We can talk about this. Chan. Chan. Wait. Chan, enough. Tino! That's enough, Chan. Chan! Please! That's enough, Chan! Stop it! Wait. Chan, stop it! Are you sure about this? Chan, stop this. I know what you're doing. Stop! Isn't this what you want? I said stop, damn it! I'll do it. I don't mind being used to fix your fucking relationship. But what the hell are you up to? I'll just take a shower. But when I'm done, I want the both of you gone. Okay? Can we talk about what happened? Chan, please say something. What do you want me to say? Do you want us to fight and scream at each other? We know where this is going. Do you want to end this? Why? Can we still fix this? How are you so calm? I put you in this difficult situation. Curse and hurt me all you want. Trust me, Tino. I want to hurt you so bad. Then why are you so calm? Because I feel stupid for thinking we can still fix this. How can we fix this? I don't deserve to be forgiven. I made a huge mistake. Whenever there's a problem, I always run away because I don't know how to face it. I leave before someone leaves me. To avoid getting hurt. Not everyone will leave you, even if you show them your worst side. If you want be like me, it's up to you. But you... you have so much love to give. Just allow yourself to be loved by other people. But before that happens, you have to forgive yourself first. Thank you for not giving up on me. There's still room. Hurry!
