That's okay, right? That's not a bad sign. No. Whatcha doin', Gene? I'm making an instrument out of spoons, and a napkin holder, and dreams, and magic. Obviously, Tina. How's the burger, Bob? BOB: It's okay. I put an egg on it. Why is Dad making a burger at 8:00 a.m.? Is he on British time? He's making it to bring to Mr. Dowling at the bank. We have a meeting this morning and we're gonna ask for an extension on our loan payment. Oh, fun. And we really, really need to get that extension. All the restaurant equipment is wrapped up in that loan. So, you're giving him a burger? Well, I mean, we can't give him money, Tina. 'Cause we don't have any? Pretty much. How about you play him some of this? (RATTLING) What, to scare him? No. To enchant him. Bob, you know I love this "bring him a burger" idea, but isn't it a little early to be making it? I mean, our appointment isn't for a while. (WHISPERING) This is a practice burger. (WHISPERING) Why are you whispering? I don't want it to hear and feel bad. Okay. (IN FEMALE VOICE) Wait, I'm a what? (IN NORMAL VOICE) Nothing. What? You're great. (SHUSHES) (IN FEMALE VOICE) Mmm, that feels nice. (IN NORMAL VOICE) I know. I know. (IN FEMALE VOICE) Don't rub my sesame seeds off. (IN NORMAL VOICE) I won't. Don't worry. They're a cute couple. Eh, I give 'em a year. I'm gonna make another practice burger. And I'm gonna try not to think too much about how much is riding on today. Maybe I should put two eggs on it. Hey! This could be your burger of the day! You can call it your, "Keep Your Sunny Side Up "and Your Cloudy Side Down, "Stay Positive, Bobby, "Things Are Gonna Be Okay Burger." Right? BOB: It's a little long. How about "Mr. Greasy"? Well, better get going. Only one more week of school and then I'm Summer Tina. And big things are comin' for Summer Tina. Big things like that heat rash you get sometimes? Bigger. Summer Louise might be making some moves that are pretty big, too. Maybe. I don't know. Don't worry about it, all right? TINA: Fine. Sorry. Summer Gene's gonna be topless 24/7 and doin' a lot of this. (RATTLING) LOUISE: Oh, great. Bye, my babies. Watch out for the messed up sidewalk! TINA: Thank you!

I brought you a burger. Oh, no thanks. I'm trying to eat less meat. Oh, my God. I'm going to close out the file. And, uh, your faces are making me sad, so if you could go? Oh, my face? And can you take the, um... hmm? There's fries in there. You want the fries? Typing till you're gone. Typing till you're gone. (RATTLING) And that is the breakthrough we've been looking for. It hurts my teeth somehow. Also who's "we"? The band! Our underappreciated but highly influential band, the Itty Bitty Ditty Committee? That we're in with my sisters. And recorder bad boy, Peter Pescadero. Oh, right. We were in a band. And we went with that name? Yes! And we were just waiting to discover our sound, and I'm sure you agree that I've found it. (RATTLING) ZEKE: I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna get ya! Come on. JIMMY JR.: Zeke. Ow. Too hard! Aah! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! (GRUNTS) I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna walk right over there and I'm gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it. I am gonna do it. Here I go. Nope. Going back over here. Can't do it. Yes, I can. Yes, I can. Zeke. Ow! Zeke. Ow! Ow, Zeke. My penis area! Nope. Not the right time. Stand down, soldier. Ready? Go! Louise! Come do a dead man's drop. Ooh, that's over there and I'm over here. But thank you. She's scared. (SCOFFS) No. I'm not. I mean, I'm scared of how comfortable I am. Over here. She's afraid her hat will fall off. (SCOFFING) You're afraid my hat will fall off. So gotcha! Good one. I mean, kinda. I don't know why she still wears that thing. It's like she's five. Oh, boy. (INHALER HISSES) Baby. (ALL GASP) What'd you say? Did you just use the B-word? Uh, I'm pretty sure she said, "lady." I heard "rabies." I'll show you rabies. (LOUISE SCREAMING) TINA: Easy. Easy. What's going on over here? A little conflict? (LOUISE SNARLS) (YELPS) BOB: Stupid bank. Sunny side up. More like crappy side up. It's gonna be okay, Bob. Bob? Do you think he remembers I ordered a burger? (TEDDY GRUNTS) LINDA: Um... Yeah. (BELL JINGLES) Your sidewalk's getting worse. Uh-huh. I saw someone trip. Hey, how are you guys gonna celebrate getting that loan extension? Should I get some T-shirts made? I'd wear one. We didn't get the extension, Teddy. What? But you made a burger! He's eating less meat, Teddy! Okay! Jeez. He's eating less meat. Bob, calm down. Seven days. We can do this. All we have to do is sell enough burgers in seven days to pay the bank, which is... BOB: A lot. Eh, well, that's not that much, right? We can do it. Hey, there's gonna be more business down at the Wonder Wharf 'cause of the Octa-wharfiversary! Oh, yeah, the Octa-wharfiversary. More foot traffic. Uh, yeah. That's true. And feet have mouths. Mouths that we could put burgers in. Right, Bob? Yeah. Feet have mouths. (LAUGHS) Feet mouths. (BOB CHUCKLES) There he is. See? Doesn't it feel good to be a little hopeful? Instead of being scary and shouty. And making people feel nervous to ask about their order.

LINDA: Oh, hey, Mr. Dowling. Don't worry about this at all. We're doing great! Seven days! (CHUCKLES) He's shaking his head, but that's probably just 'cause he's got a bug on his face. CALVIN: Look out! (HORN BEEPS) Landlord coming through! Wealthy landlord coming through. That's a big hole, Bob. What'd you do? What? I agree. This is in no way caused by old and leaky outflow pipes that the landlord of this property should have replaced years ago. Good point, sir. Is this important? Because, (CLEARS THROAT) Calvin, we were right in the middle of flyering for Wonder Wharf and champumping. How long do you think this'll take to fill in, Mr. Fischoeder? Well, let's see, what year is it now? Oh, my God. He's kidding. (CHUCKLES) You're kidding, right? Yes. Let's say yes. I'm putting you in charge of this, Felix. You're my ne'er-do-well brother who no one believes in, but maybe filling holes is your thing. And you just need a chance to shine. Grover, I'm delegating this to you, since you're our something. Lawyer. And cousin. Right. Ugh. Anyway, the city will take care of this. Probably done soon-ish? Or sooner! See, Bob? Our hole's getting filled. GENE: If I had a nickel... Gene. Shall we champump our way out of here? Finish passing out these flyers? (GULPS) (GRUNTS, SIGHS) I'm exhausted. (SLURPING) "Eighty years of cheap thrills and almost no decapitations." Wow, that's such a low amount. I know. Can you believe it? She's lasted 80 years without getting sued out of existence or collapsing into the sea. LOUISE: That's what we say about Dad. BOB: Louise. My dad left all this to me, the pier, all these buildings. I still can't tell if it was a joke. (COUGHS) Should've been me. Oh, well, that would've been funny. Ha, true. (FELIX MUMBLES) This says you're gonna have live music at the "newly half renovated bandshell." Yes. We've got that accordion group, Accordinary People. Everybody loves them. We've got Johnny Jazz Hands. He does something with his hands that I don't want to spoil. Thank you. And our band, the Itty Bitty Ditty Committee! Ha! Oh. You're serious. I'm gonna step away from you. All right, fellas. Let's not be here anymore. Bye, burger people. See you when the rent's due. (SCATTING) Put it in my mouth. (SIGHS) Rent. Oh, rent. Mr. Fischoeder. We need your help! CALVIN: Mm... Mm-mm. Mm-mm. No, yeah, yeah. Oh, my. The bank's being kinda cranky about our business loan. So, can we not pay you rent for a little bit? So we can pay the bank? You want to not pay me rent? Am I understanding your ridiculous question? Just for this month. FELIX: Mm-mm, mm-mm. Mm. Mm-mm. Mm. I agree with Felix. Well, I am of two minds, and by that, I mean, drunk. So, I'm going to say maybe. FELIX: Hmm. Oh, hush. Drive on! FELIX AND CALVIN: ♪♪ We're drivin g on the sidewalk ♪♪ Ha! Why "Ha"? 'Cause we don't have to pay rent. That'll help us with the bank. He said, "maybe." Yeah, but he winked when he said it. He's only got one eye. How do you know it wasn't a blink? I can tell. Hi, Jimmy Jr. Hi, Tina. This is cool. It's so deep. It's like at any moment the Earth can just swallow us up. Yeah... ANDY: 'Cause it loves us so much. OLLIE: Mr. Belcher, do you have a backup restaurant, in case the Earth gets this one? BOB: Um, no. OLLIE: Oh. Louise, get away from the hole. Get away from the hole. Please! All right, I'm going upstairs to go to the bathroom, and they said we won't be able to flush while they're fixing the water pipe, so, last one to go, I hope you had your shots, 'cause it's gonna get intense in there. TINA: I wanna go first. Or at least not last. GENE: I wanna go last. I wanna be the cherry on top! (CHEERFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (CHEERFUL MUSIC CONTINUES) Stop staring at that hole, Hole and Oates. Come to bed! No one came in today. I know. And now we have six days to pay the bank. Yep. (SIGHS) And Mr. Fischoeder didn't call us back about the rent. We still don't know what kind of "maybe" that was. Ninety percent of "maybes" are yeses. Definitely not true. We've said "maybe" to being in Teddy's book club so many times. Well, they fixed the pipe, that's good, right? And it's a pretty blue plastic. So modern. We're hip now. Hmm. Hey, Mr. Mopey, what was that thing you told me your mother used to say? I don't know. "Something stinks in here"? No. It was like, "Hope and grit "keeps you out of the you-know-what." Oh, yeah. She did say that. I think she thought that was very edgy. Well, it's true, too. Mm. Come on. Come to bed. Tomorrow, the hole will get all filled up, and we'll sell a million burgers. And you'll be able to make facial expressions again, huh? Mm. Happy. Mm. Hopeful. Mm. Kissy lips. (MUFFLED) Stop, please. Closed eyes, piggy nose! Lin. "I love Linda!" Mm. Aw, I love you too, Bobby! Okay, bed! (MUFFLED) Kids, lights out soon, okay? We're good parents. TINA: Tina rode Jericho down the beach, Jimmy Jr. rode his horse, Vericho. Vericho... S'vane. From Spain... (LAUGHING) Too slow. JERICHO: I'm running. I'm running. I'm running. If you want to catch us you'll have to take off those bulky jeans, uh, to be more aerodynamic. Oh, you're doing it already. Great! You're right. I'm faster when I'm just wearing underwear. TINA: They galloped along the endless sand, side by side. This is a perfect day. All my favorite stuff in one place. You, my main horse, Jericho. If only there were... Oh, there they are. Hi, sexy zombies. ZOMBIES: Hi, Tina! Damn. Oh. Hey, I have something for you. Oh, yeah? Is that what I think it is? My barrette-clace. It's a combination of barrette and necklace. Cool. Gosh, I'm so nervous. I shouldn't be nervous in my own fantasy. This is a fantasy? Don't worry about that. Forget I said anything. Uh, I was wondering why I was so good at horsetop riding. Horseback. What? Nothing. Wait, let's stop. Let's stop. Whoa, whoa, Jericho. JERICHO: (WHINES) I hate stopping. So, why are you nervous in your own fantasy? Is it because you're having some doubts about real me, Summer Boyfriend-wise? Doubts, what? I'm sensing some doubts. Hey, how about you have a fantasy and you can ask a lot of questions in that, huh? Don't ruin this, Fantasy Jimmy Jr. You're ruining it. You're making me say these things. I am not. Did you lose your jeans or your mind? Right? (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) Okay, take it easy. Ow! Ahh! You take it easy, okay? Tina, calm down. What's happening? What's happening, right now? This is fun. We're having fun on the friggin' beach. Son of a butt! (RATTLING) Mm-mm-mm! That sounds good. Dad's been using this restaurant stuff all wrong. Bibbity-bibbity-bibbity-bam! Bibbity-bibbity-bam! (CROWD CHEERING) Thank you! We are the Itty Bitty Ditty Committee! Yeah! (CROWD CHEERING) Hey, Ken! You made it! I thought you were at a conference in Houston. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Do you guys wanna hear one more song? (RUMBLING) What the... (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) ROBOT: Stop. What? Stop playing. Why? We can hear you from our planet and it makes our teeth hurt. GENE: You have teeth? ROBOT: Yeah, I think so. How about you go get some different instruments and maybe figure out if music is, I don't know, your thing? But everyone loves us. ROBOT: No, they were being nice. See? They left. GENE: Oh. ROBOT: So, this is getting awkward. Look, I'm not saying we'll destroy your planet, but it's not, like, off the table, if you play one more note on that thing. Um... Bye. So, thank you for coming. I know you all have busy schedules. Dodomeki, Bakaneko, Okoro Kamui, unlicensed Burobu plushie, Kuchi Kopi, melted Kuchi... We are happy to be here. Kiss ass. What's that? You heard me. LOUISE: Fellas, please. I've got a situation. At school. Chloe Barbash called me a baby. What do we do? Ideas. Go. Shoot her out of a cannon? Uh, karate chop her in half? Find a shark and throw it at her? These are just off the top of my head. I don't know if anyone else is going to jump in? Okay, we have cannon, karate, shark. What else? Why did she call you a baby? It was the dead man's drop thing. I didn't wanna do it. I was worried all my loose change would fall out. Okay. All right, fine. It's also because of my hat. My ears. I don't know if you guys have noticed, but I, like, wear them a lot. Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now that you mention it. Some people think, Chloe thinks that I'm scared to not wear them. Which is crazy. Totally. And why's she dropping these B-bombs on me like it's nothing? It's offensive. To, you know, babies. I mean, you are talking to your toys right now. Is this a bad time to bring that up? LOUISE: Uh, you're collectibles. Damaged collectibles, some of you, who are lucky to still be in the mix. Yep. Right, yep. Got it. How are these baby-ish? I mean, yeah, I've had them since preschool, and sure, I was thinking about maybe not wearing them anymore... Wait, back up. Did you say you've had them since preschool? Yes. You don't know the story? Is it long? Shush! Tell us. My parents gave me these, because it was the first day of preschool and I guess I was scared or something, and my mom made them, and they gave them to me so I would be brave. So, what I'm hearing is your head has not grown since preschool. Hey, some people's heads just start out the perfect size and stay that way, okay? Guys, we're supposed to be coming up with ideas here. How do I step to Chloe, get my rep back, and just generally bring it? Oh, oh, oh! Melted night light idea light bulb. Just say it. You go in the hole. The hole in front of the restaurant? Yeah, yeah! Get video. Get it on tape. You down in that scary hole. Doing your thing. Interesting. You know what they say, babies come out of hol es, they don't go into them. Do they say that? They do. All the time. I've never heard it. Anyway, there's your dead man's drop, Louise. You drop into the abyss. That sounded cool. Admit it. GOOD KUCHI KOPI: Your breath's not cool. BAD KUCHI KOPI: Oh, please. I brushed. (THUNDER RUMBLING) TINA: So, I'm supposed to videotape you climbing down into the hole so you can show kids at school? Yeah. 'Cause babies don't go into holes, they come out of them. Okay, you have to stop saying that. And what am I supposed to do again? You say, "Louise, don't go down there. It's dangerous." And then, when I go anyway, you gasp. Like this? (GASPS) No, do it better. Can I say, "Honey, no"? TINA AND LOUISE: No. How about, (DRAWLS) "What?" Just the line and then the gasp is great. Thank you. All those in favor of doing this tomorrow morning? Gene, I see your hand's almost up. No! Mom and Dad would try and stop me. It has to be now. Roll tape. Okay. TINA: (DRAWLING) Uh... (SIGHS) It's not that scary. You're just all in your head right now. Get out of your head. Big girl, pajama pants. Come on! (DRAMATICALLY) Louise, don't go down there. It's dangerous! Louise, don't go down there. It's dangerous! Louise, don't go down there. It's dangerous! I think we got it. That last one was good. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS) I can't. Oh, not what I was expecting. Yeah, well, let's just for get I even brought it up... (GENE AND TINA GASP) (LOUISE SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) Louise, are you okay? (SIGHS) Yes! Did you mean to wave your arms all over the place while falling into the hole? 'Cause if so, you nailed it. Yes, it all went great. Can you toss me the light? Here. LOUISE: Ow. Did you say, "ow" 'cause you caught it? Great! Argh! So, is that a wrap? Yep. Yeah, I think we're good. Wanna go ahead and help me out? I'll grab the rope and try to climb up and you guys pull. With our arms? Okay. Tell us when. LOUISE: Okay, yeah, just trying to... (GRUNTING) Stupid mud, I hate you. Stay on, frickin' light. Okay, pull. (GRUNTS) (BOTH STRAINING) (WHIMPERING) Ugh. Hold on. My foot's stuck. My foot's stuck. That's not at all terrifying. Everything's gonna be fine. (SQUELCHING) (GRUNTING) What the... (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (SCREAMING) (BOTH SCREAMING) (ALL CONTINUE SCREAMING) (CHOKING) (COUGHING) (DRAWLING) So, how's our girl? (CAMERAS CLICKING) BOB: Now it's a crime scene. Great, great, great, great. TINA: That's the spirit, Dad! Oh, my baby. My sweet baby. Enough, Mom! I'm okay. Take it easy with the baby stuff. Sorry, sorry. Oh, come here. (KISSING NOISILY) My baby. Mom! I know someone's dead and their bones fell on your face. In my mouth! In my mouth! Let's just be clear. I tasted death. I'm sorry you tasted death, Louise, but this is bad. I don't think they fill in crime holes very quickly. Crime hole. Gene. Oh, yeah, they're really slow. Oh, hey, Sergeant Bosco. Yeah, they brush the dirt away with tiny little tools. And their lunch break takes forever, 'cause they use tiny forks. I'm kidding about the forks thing, but yeah, it's gonna take a while. Aw, nuts. (BOB SIGHS) You know, they found a bullet lodged in the ribs. And I don't think he fell on it, if you know what I mean. So, it's in front of your restaurant, did you do it? What? No! Okay, easy. Just checking. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. I don't know. One time I saw him crumple a receipt in a way that made me uncomfortable. So much rage! Gene. Crime hole! Crime hole! Tina. Sorry. Well, I'm gonna split. Back to Robbery Division, which is just as good as Homicide, maybe better. Everyone says that. Sometimes Homicide begs for help from us Robbery guys. Hey! Get out of here! Get out of here, go! (WHIMPERING) All right, kids, you gotta get out of here, too. Go to school and don't go in any more holes, you hear me? And stay away from crevices. Oh, my sweet baby. Come here, come here! (KISSING NOISILY) Mom! ANDY: You love me. OLLIE: And you love me. ANDY: And you love me. OLLIE: And you love me. ANDY: Time for us to get married. I do! I do! I do! What are you looking at there? A fun rock? (GASPS) Louise, that's evidence! You should have given that to the police! What? Tooth-ifer? No, no, no. This is mine. I earned it. When you go into a hole... Accidently fall into a hole. A-bup-bup! Gracefully tumble in while screaming? Go into a hole, you get to keep whatever lands in your mouth. That's a rule. That's true under the bleachers, too! Plus, look at it. Isn't it the weirdest shaped tooth you've ever seen? Okay, maybe not too close. (GAGS) You can't handle the tooth! It was in my mouth, Tina! It's just, I think it's, like, against the law for you to have that. Don't worry. It's just a souvenir. I'll keep it to myself. Check it, people. A dead man's tooth. (ALL GASP) And she's showing the whole school. I went down to the sinkhole at night, found a skeleton, this tooth fell in my mouth. Did somebody say that's badass? Like the ultimate dead man's drop? I mean, I guess, maybe, I don't know. It was very dramatic, and we got it all on tape. Oh! But we gotta get it transferred to a format that anyone else in the world has. I think my dad h as that kinda player. This just looks like that kind. Questions? Oh, my God, Eli put his retainer on a chain and gave it to you? So romantic. Yeah, we're gonna be summer boyfriend-girlfriend. JOCELYN: Wait, but doesn't he, like, need it? TAMMY: What are you, a doctor? JOCELYN: I don't know. TAMMY: Where's your pager? Hmm, maybe this is a good time to bring this baby out. Cafeteria, pretty magical setting. Just gotta untangle it a little bit, and then it's time for that special moment. JIMMY JR.: Hey, Zeke, throw a chicken nugget in my mouth. Okay. Ow. Throw it again. Ow. Throw it again. God, he's still trying to catch that chicken nugget in his mouth. His whole eighth grade year. Ow. Throw it again. Should we just not do this? No, I wanna be able to say I caught a chicken nug get in my mouth. More than anything. Otherwise, this has all been a waste. I see your point. We'll get you there. (SIGHS) Maybe now's not right. He's got a lot going on. But still excited about this. Whoo-hoo. And that's why I'm starting my foundation, Sinkhole Kids. It's to help kids who've been in sinkholes. It changes you. Some people can't handle it. Fourth graders, why are you not sitting down? Or are you sitting? It's hard to tell. You're all so small. Hey! Oh, Louise, I have been meaning to ask you, where'd you get your hat? I want to get one like that for my niece. She's three and she loves bunnies. (CHLOE GIGGLING) Back off, Labonz. What? I'm trying to cheer her up. Potty training's not going well. (LOUISE GRUNTS) It's nasty. Oh, hello, Louise. Did you have a nice, nutritious meal? (LOUISE GROWLS) (GASPS) Stupid Chloe Barbash, laughing. I'll laugh at her. She's not gonna laugh at me. What? Nothing. Okay, uh, call me back. Thank you. Bye. So, how many times is it okay to call your landlord and leave a message? Depends. Does he like-like you? I still can't believe we were livin' above a dead body this whole time. I couldn't even tell. I wonder who the skeleton was. George Washington? I can't think of any other dead people. Well, whoever it was, they were murdered to death, then buried to death by a murderer-burier. And a Scorpio, probably. I'm gonna call him one more time. (ALL PROTESTING) Easy, Bob, easy. Lin, we have to pay the bank. You shout that a lot now. We only have four days left. There's no way we can pay rent and come up with the bank's money. We haven't sold any burgers. Teddy's had a lot of burgers. Right. We haven't sold any burgers to someone besides Teddy. Oh, my God. Look it. They're talking about our hole. The skeleton discovered earlier this morning under Ocean Avenue has been identified as missing Wonder Wharf employee, Daniel DeAngelo, widely known to park customers as Cotton Candy Dan. Cotton Candy Dan? Is that the guy who sold corndogs? Mom, shush. Police sources tell Channel Six news that a suspect is being taken into custody tonight. A-ha! There you go. They have a suspect. Now they'll un-crime scene our hole and fill it in. And Mr. Fischoeder will call us back too, and he'll tell us we can slide on the rent, and we'll be on easy street. If easy street had a big hole in it, huh? (SIGHS) Maybe you're right. Sorry. Sorry, I was freaking out. Sorry, everybody. Something's just come in. This is breaking news. Wonder Wharf owner, Calvin Fischoeder, has been arrested and charged with the murder of Cotton Candy Dan. (ALL GASP) What the... Oh, my God. Okay, that's not good. We now go live to police headquarters. REPORTER: Mr. Fischoeder, do you have any comments for us at this time? I haven't killed any carnies. There. I think that clears everything up. I refer all further questions to my personal attorney and personal cousin, Grover Fischoeder. My client is innocent and we're gonna prove it. Yeah, sure, a bullet from my brother's gun was found in the guy's body. Uh... (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) FELIX: And sure, a lot of people heard him yelling, "I'm going to kill you, carnie, "and I'm going to bury your body "where no one can find it." Sure. GROVER: Uh... Yeah. But who among us hasn't said those exact words while gambling with carnies on a stormy night, huh? Uh, no one. We've all said those words. (SIGHS) Maybe we'll be his one phone call? Oh, the weather. (FORECASTER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) TEDDY: Hey, Wharfiversary stuff's still going on. I heard they're doing half-priced rides and free popcorn. Yeah, kinda busy out there. TEDDY: Hmm, people do not seem to mind going to a park owned by a murderer. LINDA: If only we could get to the people. Why can't restaurants move around, you know? Just hop over the hole. Huh. Why can't buildings have little legs? That'd be cute. Yeah. Or motors, and wheels? That's cars. Oh, yeah. That's cars. (DRAWLING) Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, boy. Is Dad okay? Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. LINDA: Um... Dad, I don't wanna stop your flow, but can you pass the pilaf? Oh, God. That's butter. You know what? Butter's better. (CONTINUES DRAWLING) Oh, no. How you doin' there, big guy? (SIGHS) I don't know. I mean, I held it together in front of the kids during dinner, but I'm really worried. Oh, yeah? I couldn't tell. It's just our landlord's gonna go to prison. The bank's gonna call in our loan, and then they'll take our restaurant stuff, and we will live in a box on the street. This is what's gonna happen. Oh, Bob, I need you. The kids need you. What do you mean? You and the kids need me to not go out of business. No. Going out of business down there is not as bad as going out of business in there. My soft pec? No, your heart. Look, I know you're Droopy Bob right now. But you know who else is in there? Dreamy Bob. The guy who wanted to open a restaurant in the first place, slap his name on it, make cuckoo crazy burgers with wild ingredients. A new one every day. I did not say "cuckoo crazy" burgers. I would not say that. You know what I mean. Super funky burgers. Well, no matter what I said, I think that may be Dreamy Bob is dumb and Droopy Bob just kinda sees things the way they are. You know what you gotta do to Droopy Bob? Um, what? You gotta punch him in the nuts, like this. Ow! Sorry, sorry, sorry. But you know what I'm saying. It's like a metaphor. Like this. Ow! Stop! It's not a metaphor if you actually do it. Yes, it is. I'm going to sleep. Good night. And, hey, who knows, maybe Mr. Fischoeder is innocent. He gets out, we put that wink in the bank. I don't know if he's innocent, but he is going to prison. Well, at least the other prisoners will like his eyepatch. That's a good look for prison. You know, conversation starter. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Bye, kids. Have fun at school. Gene, I hope we do okay on that math homework. I was really wingin' it. Four. I hope so too. Good guess. (GENE AND TINA YELP) All right. Emergency kid meeting. What? Now? Here? Yeah, we gotta talk. Outdoor, before school, emergency kid meeting? Is this about whatever's going on with Tina's bangs right now? I've been wanting to fix them all morning. Wait, what? LOUISE: No, listen. I heard Mom and Dad talking last night. The restaurant is in big trouble. Boy trouble? Girl trouble? All the trouble. Mr. Fischoeder can't go to prison. If he does, Mom and Dad won't be able to pay the bank, and then that's it. No more restaurant. And what are we gonna do with Mom and Dad after school if there's no more restaurant? Huh. Sign them up for sports? But the good news is, I think Mr. Fischoeder is innocent. Innocent? But what about how guilty he is? Well, why was he so relaxed about that hole? If you had buried a guy in that exact spot, wouldn't you be a little more anxious to fill it in? Or at least go sneak that sucker out of there and stick them somewhere else? Like how you re-hide your journal every night? No, I don't. So, here's the plan. We need to skip school... No. Yes. We need to gather evidence, talk to witnesses. We need to start now. But, Louise, if you don't think Mr. Fischoeder did it, who did? Here's what I'm thinking. This was actually a beef between two carnies. Beef con carnie. LOUISE: Mm-hmm. You get your hands on Fischoeder's gun, you settle your score with Cotton Candy Dan, you just got away with murder. So, what do we do with that theory? Turn it into a graphic novel. LOUISE: No, we go talk to our old pal Mickey. He's a carnie now. He probably knows all the carnie gossip. And I brought all the gear we'll need. Snacks, gum, night light. Oh, snacks. I'm in. Night light? Yeah. In case it gets dark. I thought we were doing this during school time. I don't know why I mentioned the light. Let's just get our bikes, shall we? (SIGHS) Fine. I did forget to do a bunch of homework. Great. So, we have to get past the back door without Mom and Dad seeing us. Stay low, follow my lead. Try to look like alley trash. GENE: Or raccoon poop. (JAZZY MUSIC PLAYING) (WHISPERS) We did that really well. All right. Save Mr. Fischoeder, save the restaurant, solve a murder. On three. One, two, three. ALL: Save Mr. Fischoeder, save the restaurant, solve a murder. And prove we're not babies, and Chloe Barbash is dumb. Okay, let's move. This is how Law and Order should start. Every time. LOUISE: Hi, we're looking for Mickey. Mickey? LOUISE: Yeah. Mickey. Brown hair, used to rob banks, nice guy. Works here now. No, I know Mickey. He owes me three seventy-five. Dollars? And seventy-five. Cents? Yeah, cents. LOUISE: Where is he working today? Scream-i-cane? Ah, he's off till second shift. Do you know where he lives? We could probably remind him about the three seventy-five? He lives in Carniapolis. Most of the carnies live in Carniapolis. That makes sense. Where is Carniapolis? Hang a left at the old dog food building. But don't go there. Don't go there? The dog food building? Yeah, down past the stadium. You'll smell it, then go left. But seriously, don't go there. Uh, is there a reason you keep saying, "Don't go there"? Because you shouldn't. Okey dokey. Just wanted to clarify, but, um, why should we... Hi, is the park open? No, I'm just here 'cause I'm trapped inside this booth. Yes, we're open. All rides half off today. The only crime would be to not take advantage of these prices. Okay, new sign. I think this is the one. "We have a 'hole' new look." BOB: Mm. "Come on in through the alley. "It's not weird. Love, Linda and Bob." BOB: I guess that's professional. "P.S., alley smells like pee, restaurant is fine." (MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY) Oh, Bob. Dirt. BOB: Dirt? Dirt. BOB: (GRUNTS) I'm getting up. Oh, dirt. They're gonna fill in the hole. LINDA: Yeah. Look at them. LINDA: (GASPS) Uh... Where are they going? BOB: They are leaving. LINDA: And they're leaving the dirt? BOB: They are leaving the dirt. Do we put it in ourselves, or... They probably have someone else coming. A dirt installer? Mm. It's nice. It's like a little mountain. I don't like it. I think it should be in the hole. LINDA: Mm. Bob. Linda. Come. Come see. Uh... (IMITATES FANFARE) I call it the Mobile Bob Burger Mobile. So, you can sell burgers in the street. You could go anywhere. Hot street meat. It's my grill from home, but I upgraded the wheels, and I put these bars on it so you can move it. LINDA: Oh, wow. Uh-huh. It's got a cooler for drinks. Got a little umbrella here. Ah! You got a place to keep buns and toppings. I figure, you grill, Linda serves, and I'll push it around for you. So, I'll be there the whole time with you guys, keeping the banter going, being part of each other's lives. You know, laughing, loving, learning. Teddy, Teddy, Teddy. It's so nice of you to do this. But we... we don't have a license to sell food on the street. We could get fined. (CHUCKLES) Nah. I'll keep an eye out for the cops. I don't think we can... LINDA: I love it. Wait, what'd you say? I love it. Right? You can't get the people to your burgers, you bring the burgers to them. (SIGHS) I feel like we're just skipping over my "we don't have a license" comment. Oh, come on, Bob. It's not a law, right? It's like I'm supposed to wear a hairnet when I work in the kitchen, but I never do. That's a law. Also a law. They're both laws. Bob, we have to sell some burgers today, right? Yes. LINDA: We got four days to pay the bank. That's true. Come on. Okay, fine. But only because we're desperate. This place can't close. I can't live if livin' is without you. Teddy. I said we could do it. Oh, good. Let's light this sucker up, huh? You got it. (ALL YELP) No problem. No problem. Just gotta check the gas line. Might have had it up a little bit high. (CHUCKLES) You guys meet me back here with some ground beef, and some comfortable shoes, and maybe an apron for me so we all kinda have a uniform. Oh, that gives me an idea. Bob, I gotta go up to the apartment real quick. Be right back. Okay, Bob, grab your meat. Please don't shout that at me. Right, right. (WHISPERS) Grab your meat. Smells like the most stuff you can grind up to make food. TINA: Oh, look, that was their slogan. GENE: Huh. TINA: This doesn't look right. No one lives here. GENE: I don't know why. It's beautiful. (INDISTINCT YELLING) LOUISE: Whoa, you hear that? TINA: Huh. They sound cranky. LOUISE: Let's check it out. TINA: Oh, okay. I miss school. I'm feeling suddenly like I love fractions. TINA: Yeah, I wanna learn about photosynthesis so badly right now. If this is Carniapolis, maybe we shouldn't disturb their scary sounding carnie time? I mean, it's a little like they're deciding who to shiv and if they see us, they'll be like, "Oh, let's shiv them." But you know, maybe not. (INDISTINCT YELLING CONTINUES) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS) TINA: Are they playing a game with duckies? GENE: Adorably? Lucky ducky. Lucky ducky. Damn. Kids. Hi, Mickey. How's it going? You here to buy drugs? You don't buy drugs. I can't even swallow pills. We have to hide them in his food. We, uh, wanted to ask you some questions. Mickey, your turn. Oh. Can you skip me? We play lucky ducks, but we play carnie rules. TINA: Seems fun. There's more beer and yelling than when kids play it at Wonder Wharf. Yeah, well, we're toasting Cotton Candy Dan. That's why we're also gambling and pushing each other and punching each other. The first shift folks made a nice little memorial to put on the pier in his old spot. And us second shift folks are, uh, doing this. Uh-huh. (WHISPERS) Just ask him. (WHISPERS) I will. But pretty soon, right? Give me a second. I can't just say, "Hey, Mickey, which carnie killed Cotton Candy Dan?" Wait, did you say, "Which carnie killed Cotton Candy Dan?" (LAUGHS AWKWARDLY) LOUISE: It did sound like that, didn't it? You come in to Carniapolis and accuse a carnie of killing another carnie? I think that's right. Is that right? You know, it's bad enough that Mr. Fischoeder kills one of us, which is bad boss alert, am I right? Yeah. But to throw it back on us? Hey, hey, they're just kids. Kid cops. Little kid cops. They have those, you know? For going into small spaces and hiding in boxes. Nah, I know these guys. They're not cops. They're little burger babies. (LOUISE GROWLS) Maybe don't use that word. What? "Burger"? Sorry. Meat patties? It's just too much. First Fischoeder kills Cotton Candy Dan, now this?

I think I'm gonna have my next birthday party there. TINA: Oh, good idea. Yeah, the theme's gonna be "disgruntled." That's nice. Um... Am I being paranoid, or is that big scary carnie following us? (GASPS) Maybe he just remembered that he forgot to murder us. Oh, God. Quick, this way. (ALL PANTING) TINA: Dead end. GENE: That's worse than split ends. Uh, Tina, why'd you say go this way? TINA: I didn't. (ALL SCREAM) (GASPS) Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. No, no, of course not. Just following kids into alleys. Everybody loves that. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Is there something we can do for you? You were asking who wanted to kill Cotton Candy Dan? No, I mean, before. But not anymore. We've moved on. I got something to tell you. I didn't wanna say it back there. They don't wanna hear what I gotta say. We're listening. But maybe not making eye contact. I was there that night, you know? The last night anyone saw Dan. You were? Yeah. We were playing lucky ducky on the wharf. And sure, Dan and Mr. Fischoeder got into a big fight. Mr. Fischoeder started throwing ducks at Dan's head. He kept yelling "duck," and it was confusing. I can see that. Anyway, after the game, I went back 'cause I forgot my stress ball. And it's just Dan, Mr. Fischoeder, and Felix Fischoeder, and they're yelling at each other, and they're all throwing ducks. Wait. Felix was at the game? No. He wasn't. Mr. Fischoeder doesn't let him play lucky ducky because Felix gives all the duckies different voices and personalities and it makes it take a while. That's why it was weird that he showed up that night. But nobody back there wants to hear that maybe Mr. Fischoeder didn't do it. Oh, my God. Of course. Felix Fischoeder. It's so Felix. He has access to Mr. Fischoeder's gun. He was fighting with both Mr. Fischoeder and Cotton Candy Dan. And most importantly, he has a motive. He has a motive to frame his brother. Because he's mad Mr. Fischoeder doesn't like his lucky ducky voices? No, because I bet you if Mr. Fischoeder goes to jail, Felix gets his money. We gotta go to the cops. Oh. Uh, mind if I don't go to the cops? I have to pick up my dry cleaning, because it's dry now. LOUISE: Yeah, no problem. Okay. LOUISE: Let's go, let's go, let's go. GENE: Thank you, scary carnie. Love you. Bye. CARNIE: Bye. TEDDY: Well, everything fits perfectly. What's this for? Olive bar. What? I thought you could have imported olives, and they could go there. Oh. I'm not sure... While you wait for a burger, you help yourself to an imported olive. Okay. I got these on my way over. You can pay me later. Mm. Mobile Bob Burger Mobile is a little fancier than restaurant Bob Burgers. You'll get used to it. Where's Linda? I feel like she's missing all the fun of us setting up this cart together. Ta-da! What's happening? I get it. No questions from this guy. I'm the marketing department. I took Gene's burger suit, let out the crotch a little bit, and bam. I'll push the product, while you push the cart. But the bikini. It's summer. And sex sells, baby. Yeah, Bob. Is that sex? A burger with a bikini on it? Uh, yeah. LINDA: Mm-hmm. Okay, let's do it. Yay. All right. I dreamt this. Oh. No, don't tell us. No, it was nice. Linda wasn't in it. It was just a burger in a bikini. BOB: Yeah, still don't tell us. TEDDY: I'm so happy right now. Let's go save your restaurant! Sergeant Bosco. (SPLUTTERS) Holy smokes, you scared me. Sorry. Sorry. Don't sneak up on a cop. That's our job. We sneak up on you. Why are you here? We went to the police station, where you live, I assume. But nobody from Homicide would talk to us. So, then we went to look for you in Robbery, but they said you were on a stakeout. And they told you where I was? They said you were at a dangerous biker gang headquarters, and we said, "The One Eyed Snakes"? And they said, "Yeah," and we said, "Oh, we know those guys." And they were like, "What?" And we were like, "Yeah, they're really nice." Get down, get down. (SHUSHING) GENE: You get down. TINA: (WHISPERS) Gene. GENE: (WHISPERING) Sorry. We are also getting down. What are we looking for? (WHISPERS) Bikers. Right. But, doing what? We got a tip that they stole a bunch of karaoke machines, and I'm watching to see if they try and move the goods. That doesn't seem like their kind of crime. CRITTER: ♪♪ Come on, shake your body ♪♪ Baby, do the conga ♪♪ You know you can't control yourself any longer ♪♪ Oh, okay. SERGEANT BOSCO: Mm-hmm. Anyway, we're here to tell you that the police have the wrong guy. Mr. Fischoeder didn't kill Cotton Candy Dan. His brother, Felix, did. Wait, aren't you kids supposed to be in that place with the books and adults that tell you stuff? Adult bookstore? No. School? Yeah. School. Some of us think we are supposed to be in school right now. Yes. Tina, the restaurant, remember? If Mr. Fischoeder goes to jail, the restaurant goes under. Down under. Where the didgeridoo whatever they're gonna do. (GRUNTS) Get out. Get out of my unmarked stakeout vehicle. Go catch tadpoles or whatever kids do. Go catch tadpoles? Yeah. Tadpoles? Yeah. The things that turn into frogs. We know what they are. I was pretty sure. Not bad to clarify. We're city folk. Oh, I see. You're just Robbery. SERGEANT BOSCO: Mm. You couldn't help even if you wanted to. Because it's a homicide. You don't know anything about that case, do you? I know stuff. I know all the stuff. Name one stuff. I know something that's not in the papers. (SCOFFS) Yeah, right. I do. They found a cufflink in the hole, near the body. Yeah? A very unique cufflink. Custom. It's a banana wearing a graduation hat. Hmm, classy. Carnies don't wear cufflinks. True. Lotta tank tops. I know carnies don't wear cufflinks. They searched Fischoeder's house, but they haven't found the other one. Huh. Yeah. But I bet they didn't search Felix's. We need to go to Felix's place and look for that cufflink. Go, go, go. Hate it. Terrible plan. Don't like it. Oh, good. Looks like you're taking your annoying conversation somewhere else. Bye. Sergeant Bosco, you know you left the light on the top of your car. Huh? What? Oh, damn it. Son of a... Argh. Okay. At least no one saw. They don't know I'm here. Get away. Get away. Shoo. Shoo. Hey, kids. Hey, Louise. LOUISE: Hey, Critter. You bothering that nice policeman? No. I'm not a policeman. What are you... Son of a... Dang nab. Oh, my bad. You're just a regular guy. I'm sorry. Your badge is on the dashboard. Can they see that? And your coffee says "Sergeant Bosco" on it. All right, get away. Fresh hot burgers. Sexy burgers. BOB: Lin. What? ♪♪ You wanna eat a burger ♪♪ Does she look like a weird streetwalker? Not too much. How's the burger? It's great. I've never eaten outside before. Wait, what? MAN: Hi. Are you selling burgers? We are. I'll take a cheeseburger. What was it? What made you want a burger? I was hungry. And then you saw a... Cart. And a person dressed as a... She's not with us. Shoo, shoo. Oh, Bob. Fresh hot burgers. Sexy burgers. Fresh hot... (GASPS) Bob, it's Hugo. TEDDY: Hugo the health inspector? Oh, God. They know we don't have a license to do this. Um, did you mean for me to hear that? Shh! Crouch down. Okay, but I feel a little weird about it. It's just quite a coincidence, that's all. I start using chapstick, and then, all of a sudden, you start using chapstick? Why can't you just be flattered? Oh, fine, use it. Oh, thank God. (WHISPERING) They're gonna see us. Let's hide in Wonder Wharf. Teddy, let's move. I'm still eating my burger. Do I go, too? Yes, stay low. Are you coming, Ron? Sorry, putting on my chapstick. HUGO: Hmm. Hmm? Hmm. (JAZZY MUSIC PLAYING) (WHISPERS) Treehouse. Go. (GRUNTING) (PANTING) Hmm. Hmm. Heaven? Sounds like heaven. I think she's saying we're number one. But we're "not all there, upstairs." Oh, my God. I'm saying let's go up the ladder and listen for Felix, and see if he's in there. Oh, that makes more sense. TINA: Mm-hmm. (IN ADULT-LIKE VOICE) Felix Fischoeder? That treehouse hot tub you ordered is here. (IN NORMAL VOICE) Okay, he's not home. Oh, God. People, we are looking for a banana cufflink. An educated banana cufflink. Also, we might be in a murderer's house, just an FYI. Yep, yep. If he comes home, you fight him. TINA: Uh... (DOG CARNIE GRUNTING RHYTHMICALLY) DOG CARNIE: Oh. Ooh. BOB: Okay, uh, do we go back out now? See if the coast is clear? Or do we stay here? Sell these folks some burgers? Um, I mean... What? Let them throw up our food on the rides. Hey, look. Bob Burgers is getting a little bit of a line. LINDA: No. We are not Bob Burgers. We work here now. (GRUNTS) At the wharf. I mean, we don't. But, I guess we could stay for a little bit. Also, we were never Bob Burgers. Hello, ma'am. Sir. You can order anything from the top-third of the front of the menu there, and anything from the left side of the middle section on the back of the menu. And you are welcome to an imported olive while you wait. Can I get the toothpick back when you're done? Bob's looking at me funny. Never mind. That is yours to keep. (SIGHS) I don't think it's here. We looked everywhere. It's definitely not in this soft, soft cashmere sweater that I'm just rubbing and rubbing. Or is it? Better keep looking.

I know that Felix is a murderer, but it's kinda sweet that he and Fanny are gonna flee the country together. It's a real he-fled, she-fled situation. What? Tina, get your head outta your boobs. Right. Right. (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYS) Hey, Tina... (GASPS) you're not really thinking about Felix and Fanny, are you? Fantasy Jimmy Jr., what are you doing here? You're thinking about me. You're thinking about this. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Holy crap. Phew! I don't have time for this. But that question you wanna ask me. You're not nervous that I'll say no. You're nervous that I'll say yes. And that real me is just never gonna be as good as fantasy me. Dang it, Jimmy Jr., not now. (YELPS) Oh, sorry. FANTASY JIMMY JR.: I'm okay. Tina, focus. Yep. Coming. Here I am. Ugh, we lost him. Great. There's the bandshell. See ya soon, Shelly. We're gonna rock so hard. Lot of confidence here, despite what some robots may say. TINA: What? Nothing. Look, the golf cart. And he's parked in front of the funhouse like a true criminal. Well, what's he doing in there? ♪♪ A lovely bunch of sailors dancing in a row ♪♪ I knew I looked good. LOUISE: Get down. FELIX: Beep-beep, ba-boop, ba-beep. Thank you. Hurry, hurry, hurry. (ALL PANTING) FELIX: And... Oh. Parked. (HUMMING) (GRUNTS) LOUISE: The Molehill? Ugh. I like the Molehill. It's the ride they recommend for grandparents and people with heart problems. I go on it with Dad. BOTH: Whee. What's happening in there? Moles got him, probably. Come on. TINA: (GRUNTS) Stupid kickstand. Wait up. I don't hear anything. Well, it says "do not enter," so I... Oh, you're going in. What the... Where the hell did he go? Ooh, buttons. You know what I like to do with these? Gene, no. Jeez, good thing you didn't push that one. Mm! Hello, lover. TINA: No, no, no, no, no. (BUTTON CLICKS) (ALL SCREAMING) GENE: Wow. (SIGHS) I think we lost them. I think we're good. Sheesh, you knock over one memorial. Well, it was a nice thing that they made for their friend who was murdered. And we were pretending that we work here, and I guess, taking money from them. And I look like a giant burger, and you know, maybe they're hungry. CARNIE: There they are. BOB: Oh, for Pete's sake. TEDDY: Go, go, go, go, go. BOB: Yep. LINDA: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I have an idea. You guys go left at the corner. I'll take the cart and go straight ahead. They'll follow the cart. BOB: I don't think that's gonna work. Good idea, Teddy. Thank you. TEDDY: Take care of Linda for me. Turn here, turn here. BOB: Uh... All right. (TEDDY YELLS) (DOG CARNIE GRUNTS) Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Should we chase those guys? DOG CARNIE: Yeah. Come on, come on, come on. BOB: Didn't work. What is this place? TINA: Did we go through a time warp? GENE: I bet we quantum leapt. Where did Felix go? Also, how do we get outta here if he tries to kill... Children? (KIDS GASP) Ew, what are you doing here? Did you hear me go pee-pee? KIDS: Uh... CALVIN: Children? Ew. LOUISE: Mr. Fischoeder. What are you doing in our secret clubhouse? What are you doing in your secret clubhouse? I thought you were in jail. I posted bail. Jail bail. Yep, had to. Those beds were bad for my back. How'd you get in here? You were running around up there pressing buttons, weren't you? Of course, we were. They're buttons. You pressed the ouchies button? Weren't you worried about ouchies? Eh. Okay, well, you can leave now. Bye. Calvin and I have some business things to do. Mm. You have creepy face again. This is why I think you should grow a beard. You know I can't! Sorry, can you give us a sec? We just need to hug. We love each other. Gross. (WHISPERS) Guys, we gotta tell Mr. Fischoeder that his brother framed him, and then get him out of here before Felix does something bad to him. TINA: This feels nice. Yeah, we should do this more often. Okay, yeah, but save the restaurant, remember? Great hug. Now, Mr. Fischoeder, can we talk to you over here? CALVIN: I don't hug. GENE: Ooh, what's this thing? LOUISE: Gene! Oh, yes, my sweet old organ. GENE: Your wiener? (CALVIN SCATS) CALVIN: That is the Orchestramarama. GENE: I love that. Interesting. Can I, uh... It is interesting. This used to be part of the old park. (LOUISE GROANS) This place was the Orchestramaramatorium. And it was the launch point for our underwater ride, Poseidon's Sea-cret, spelled S-E-A, which I'm just now getting. Oh, yeah. (GRUNTS SOFTLY) You see, when our father bought the pier, he built Wonder Wharf on top of the old park, and he hid this room away. Sealed it up under the Molehill. (MUSIC CHIMING) And ha-cha. GENE: Ooh. TINA: Whoa. CALVIN: Mm, the sea monsters win. Those look like dolphins. Well, dolphins were considered monsters back then. Mr. Fischoeder... GENE: Quick question. Yes, boy Bob child. (LOUISE SIGHS) Could our band borrow this when we headline at the Wonder Wharf bandshell this summer? I assume it's easy to move. Follow-up question, don't you think that now that we're borrowing this, we should headline at the bandshell this summer? Ha! You're dreaming. Johnny Jazz Hands is the headliner. Gene, stop getting distracted. Ooh, wanna see our secret mini-cars from the '50s that we drive in our secret under-pier? GENE: Yes. LOUISE: No, we don't. Oh, goody. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Okay, so this is here. (ENGINE STARTS) Excellent for storage under piers. Old ride parts over there. Carousel horses! Shh, I'm doing this tour. Carousel horses over there. We can get ice cream any time we want. Hello. Bye. The stuffed animal storage unit. For when you need a little snuggle. Hmm, not as many in here as I would have thought. Maybe you're right, Felix. Maybe they do come to life. I told you. This was our daycare center-slash-bar. Had to close it. Yep, kids couldn't handle their liquor. Okay, now that we got that out of our system... Uh, Felix, is that a stain on the back of your outfit? Oh, God, no. (GRUNTING) Mr. Fischoeder, we have to tell you something. It's about Felix. We think that he's... (THUD) (YELLING) (GRUNTS) CALVIN: Ah, Grover, nice of you to join us. (GROANING) Will you ever not be awkward when you come down that slide? (GRUNTS) Someday. Heh. I feel like I'm getting better at it. Mm, no. FELIX: No, you're not. Mm, Orchestramarama time. FELIX: Mm-hmm. Oh! Kids. (CHUCKLES) It's so great you have kids here. Hi, kids. Sinkhole kids. Hey, uh, lawyer guy, you got a second for some quick legal advice? Oh. (CHUCKLES) Sure you do. We're just gonna chat about a lawsuit I'm in. Tina, you wanted to talk to Felix about something? Mm-mm, no, I didn't. No, no, no, no, you should talk to him now. Really? 'Cause I'd love to not do that. Tina, talk to Felix. You'll be fine. FELIX: Oh, like you're such a treat. TINA: Sorry, sorry. Look, why don't I give you my card and you can... (GRUNTS) (WHISPERING) Felix killed Cotton Candy Dan. He's framing his brother. What? (SCOFFS) No. No. (CHUCKLING) Yes. We overheard him planning to leave the country. Well, that part's true. They're both planning to leave the country. That's why they're here. That's why I'm here. They made me bring them books on tape. They're mostly coloring books on tape. I don't even know how that works. What the hell? They're fleeing together? That doesn't make any sense. GENE: Shall I accompany you? CALVIN: No, thank you. Yes, thank you. No, thank you. Yes, thank you. No, thank you. (PLAYS ORGAN) Ooh, I like that. What did you just do? Keep doing that. (TINA DRONING) Well, this is fun. Oh, um, so, have you heard... you... from Fanny lately? Yes, we're back together-ish. That's good. Is she less homicidal now? Yes, much less homicidal. Thanks for asking. She's my little Fanny Fanny boo-boo. Aw, you really love her, huh? More than I love how I look in this outfit. (ORGAN CONTINUES PLAYING) (CALVIN CHEERING) Hmm. But, what if how you feel about her, how you feel about love doesn't ever match? How it really is? In real life? Well, this got deep. What if no one lives up to anyone's expectations? What if I'm just letting a butt lead my heart down a dead-end road? (CALVIN CONTINUES CHEERING) Boy, the energy over there seems great, doesn't it? Uh, stay in school. ♪♪ La-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪♪ (SIGHS DEEPLY) (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) (GRUNTS) Darn it. (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) Oh, my God. CALVIN: Let's play something jazzy, shall we? GENE: Oh, yes, I love jazz. Oh, is that gonna choke a fish? Look, I don't know what the deal is with Felix, but you can't let them leave the country. Mr. Fischoeder's innocent. But he said he's afraid he can't beat the charge. That's why they're fleeing to Cuba. In their submarine. What are you two hush-hushing about over there? Yeah. We can whisper too. (MIMICS WHISPERING) See? It's hurtful. We're talking about your "submarine" which as your attorney and your cousin, I advise you not to use. That thing works? And goes places? Uh, yeah. Jealous? We tricked her out. We knew we'd eventually have to flee the country for one reason or another. We're naughty little Nellies. This baby can even play books on tape. Grover, you bring the stuff? Yes. CALVIN: Oh, good. GENE: Yay. It's all online, you know. How to convert a 1920s era submarine-themed ride into an almost-real submarine. Some videos are better than others. Avoid Sub Dude's, but overall pretty simple. We shove off in an hour or so. We're just waiting for the tide. That's something submarine people say. And some of us will also be able to have one last land poo. That's another submarine term, I think. Yep, we'll be refueling in a secret cove near Myrtle Beach by midnight. And picking up someone's on-again off-again girlfriend. Ugh. Oh, shush, she's great. Okay, I forbid this. You are going to stay in this country, face trial, prove your innocence, and continue to be our landlord so we don't lose our restaurant. Great speech, Louise. Thank you. Yes. You're welcome. If you do decide to stay, we should start talking about your legal strategy. Boring. And your arraignment. Boring-er. Grover, let me put this on your head, so we don't have to hear you talking, talking, talking. No, no, no, no, no. FELIX: Yay, I did it. I put a helmet on our lawyer. Oh, my God. You oughta be on an ottoman. LOUISE: (SIGHS) Oh, my God. (CALVIN SCATTING) (MUFFLED) No. Don't. Stop. Don't hit my... Okay, nobody wants to solve this crime, and everyone is awful. Oh, let's play that game where we spin you around till you fall over. GROVER: No, no, I don't like that game. (SCOFFS) Pictures of silly rich people who just go to Cuba whenever they get charged with murder. (CALVIN WHOOPING) (GROVER WHIMPERS) GROVER: Stop it! (GRUNTING) LOUISE: Nobody will help us. Nobody cares. And the real murderer will just keep living their life and... Huh? (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) What the... Grover? GROVER: Don't like this. No, I don't want... (GRUNTS) (LOUISE GASPS) LOUISE: That shape. GROVER: Take this thing off me. Holy crap. GROVER: Stop it! LOUISE: (WHISPERING) Psst! Tina. Psst! TINA: (WHISPERING) What? (GRUNTING MEANINGFULLY) (WHISPERING) Grover. Pow-pow. (GASPS) Oh. I figured it out. I figured it out. (GRUNTS TRIUMPHANTLY) You guys seem very excited about something. Is it my sweet jam? No. (LOUISE FALTERS) (GROVER PANTING) GROVER: What? Why are you looking at me like that? Like I farted? They're the ones being jerky. Oh, no reason. I forget. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) What are you holding? LOUISE: Nothing. Um, candy. (GULPS) Mmm. So good. (GAGS) Now you're gagging. (GAGS) No. Mm-mm. (GAGS) Let me see. He really wants some candy. GROVER: Spit it. GROVER: What the... Is that a tooth? It's so weird looking and... (GASPS) That's, uh, candy for you these days. Looks like weird old teeth. GROVER: I see. And you enjoy that, do you? Yeah, well, it does the trick. Whoa, you're pointing a spear gun at us. Yeah, right. Whoa. Nobody move. Nobody move. They went this way. They must be close, right? Do you see 'em? DOG CARNIE: I can't really see anything. (WHISPERS) Bob, are those the kids' bikes? BOB: What the... And that's Mr. Fischoeder's golf cart. What is going on? I don't know. Uh-oh, uh-oh. Oh, no, I'm slipping. Oh, my... Now I'm slipping, too. Sorry. What's that sound? Oh, God. Hold on. How? Kegels. Huh. Well, now I don't hear it. Come on. Let's go to the front gate, and try to cut 'em off. DOG CARNIE: Okay. CARNIE: No, Fitz. This way. (BOTH GRUNT) BOB: Oh, God. (BOB GROANING) (GASPS) Didn't hurt. Come on, let's go find the kids. Okay, yeah, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm just gonna get all your phones. Come on. TINA: We don't have phones. And it hasn't been an issue socially at all. Oh, really? A teen girl without a phone? That's what I keep saying. It's just harder to justify every year. I mean, just... Yeah, we don't need to get into it. Bye, phones. So, you were looking at the picture, and you saw my banana cufflink, which I bought for myself when I graduated law school 'cause no one else got me a present. Oh, boo-hoo. You went to law school? I knew he bit me, but I didn't know he swallowed the damn thing. And you have that weird tooth for some reason, and it matches my scar, and now everyone thinks I murdered him just 'cause I did. Unbelievable. You killed Cotton Candy Andy? TINA: Dan. Cotton Candy Andy Dan? It's just... Never mind. You framed me? You're a terrible family lawyer. And a selfish lover, I bet. Well, we should probably hit the road. No, we're all gonna stay right here where no one's gonna come looking for you. (BOB AND LINDA SCREAMING) Oh, my face! Ha! Now you're in trouble. Our mom and dad are here. Oh, my babies. Oh, my babies. (KISSING NOISILY) I'm glad you're here. I mean, I wish you had more police with you. But, uh, yeah, also you look good, Mom. Thank you, Tina. You better not have stretched my burger suit. But the bikini can stay. I don't know why we didn't put that on in the first place. Sorry we skipped school. You skipped school? No. Why'd you do that? We were saving the restaurant and solving a murder. Solving a murder is no reason to leave school. Okay, Department of Education. Shush, shush, shush! I'm so annoyed. How did you find us? How did you even get in here? We saw the kids' bikes. Ugh, bikes! And their bikes were by some stairs. So, we went up, and we went into the little electrical place. Yay, buttons. Linda, no.

Not me, no, no, no. Why would they? Something unfortunate is going to happen to us? Uh, yes. Surprise. Oh, poo. Wait, both of us? Yeah, sorry. You were so insistent about going with your brother to Cuba... I bought an outfit. Yes, we know. But let's just say your submarine isn't going to go to Cuba. Oh. Cancun? It won't make it out from under the pier. Oh, my. Oh, dear. Did you think that sub was gonna make it to Cuba? Hmm, I think we might have gotten a little too excited about the sub idea. I mean, isn't it just an old ride? Yes, it runs on tokens. But not the best frame job, right? I mean, why bury Cotton Candy Dan in front of our restaurant and then wait six years? BELCHERS: Huh. TINA: Right. I didn't bury him in front of your restaurant. And I didn't wanna wait six years. (DRAMATICALLY) Six years. Easy. Easy. Maybe we should hold off on the questions. I had it all worked out. A top-rate murder. I shoot Mr. Carnie with Calvin's gun. I stick him in a pile of dirt, or whatever yucky stuff was near the entrance to the wharf. I leave the stupid foot sticking out, so someone would be sure to see it. But little did I know that some numbskull backhoe operator working for the city was gonna scoop up that pile without even checking for dead carnies. I come back, I've got no body. I didn't know where they'd brought the dirt. And it's not like I could go around asking, "Hey, what's the word? Did anyone find any dead guys? "This tall? Kind of a biter?" It was a nightmare. But thankfully, blessedly, your stupid pipe burst and saved the day. The skeleton was found, frame job back on, and it's true what they say, good things happen to good people. Wait a second.

No. In you go. Mm-mm. (FELIX GROANS) Grover, I just want you to know that one time when you were up at the house, Felix and I sat on your sandwich. Bare-bottomed. And then we served it to you, and you ate it all. Ugh. I knew it. I tasted baby powder and I thought to myself, how would baby powder get on a sandwich? And I was like, did they get salt and baby powder mixed up? But then I was like, no, you know exactly what happened. They sat on your sandwich... (WHISPERS) What? Because that's just... CALVIN: Mm. Mm. GROVER: the kind of thing they think is funny. They powder their bums like they're from the 1800s and they pulled down their little pants and they sat on your sandwich... (WHISPERS) I can't. GROVER: and I hate them. They're immature idiots and I hate them. What the... Go, burger people. Go! Go, go, go. Get help. (PANTING) Damn it. (GRUNTS) I hate this stupid secret clubhouse.

BOB: Does anyone wanna talk about that I'm actually doing really well, considering that I've never driven down here before in this weird under-pier, whatever this is? LOUISE: Ugh. Okay, you're doing really, really well. LINDA: Everyone compliment your father. GENE: Um, I think you're handsome for your age, which is what, 65... (GRUNTS) BOB: Oh, my God! He's ramming us!

TINA: I don't know. Maybe. Kinda. BOB: (GRUNTING) I think we lost him. TINA: Yay, Dad. Yeah, but I'm just gonna say it, this is one of our worst road trips. Eh... I mean, it's up there. (ALL SCREAMING) Oh, Bob, what if you bust through there, and we jump down onto the beach? LOUISE: What? GENE: Great idea. I see no problems. Oh, God. Okay. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. Oh, crap. Oh, God! Hold on! (ALL SCREAMING) (ALL GRUNTING) Oh, that was terrible. Oh, I didn't like that.

Bob, take the ramp. Uh-huh. Yep. (CAR GROANS) No, no, no, no. (AIR HISSES) Ha-ha! LINDA: What was that? What happened? BOB: Uh, I think he shot out our tire. LINDA: Do we have a spare? KIDS: What? I don't know. Well, he only had one arrow. That's good, right? Yeah, but maybe we keep driving anyway, if we can. If you call this driving. BOB: Sorry, signs. TINA: Hey, this is our street. Is he back there? Kids? I can't tell. Everyone, be less moist. BOB: There's our giant hole. That's how we know we're home. Uh, all right. If he's not back there, maybe we jump out, go inside, and call the police. I just got comfortable, but okay. Oh, come on, it's stuck? Oh, no. It must've got crunched when we jumped on to the beach. All right. I'm hoping one of these is reverse. It'll be the one that makes us go backwards. Thanks. (THUD) BOB: Oh, God. (CRASHING) It's him. The brakes, Bob, the brakes. I'm stepping on the brakes. LINDA: He's gonna push us into the hole. GENE: Crime hole. BOB AND LINDA: Gene. BOB: Oh, God. Kids, hold on. Oh, no, no, no. (ALL SCREAMING) BOB: Everybody okay? ALL: Yeah. Someone must have seen that. ANNOUNCER: (ON TV) He shoots, he scores. Yay! Oh, whoops. (GROVER HUMMING) (CONTINUES HUMMING) Oh, no. What's happening? He's burying us. (TINA GASPING) We gotta get out of here right now. (GRUNTING) Open! Open! Open! Open! Open! Come on, clam, let us out of you! Okay, I'm gonna try and break the windshield. Everybody, move back. How are we supposed to move back? I don't know. (GRUNTING) Okay, now pound for real. I am pounding for real. It won't break. It's thick glass. I'm gonna try and use my legs. (GRUNTS) I can't get my legs up. (BOB AND LINDA GRUNTING) It's fine. You're just a bulldozer. A lobster bulldozer pushing some dirt into a hole. Not onto a family. No, far from it. Just fixing the street like a helpful little lobster. Oh, my God. We're being buried alive in a hole in front of our restaurant. This is my nightmare. We're living my nightmare. Phones. We can use our phones. Where are they? Grover took our phones. (HYPERVENTILATES) Holy crap. Oh, God. (HUFFS) Kids, hold my hands. Where are your hands? Where are your hands? And put that memory in a place you don't think about. Now, let's get back to the wharf, launch my cousins into the sea, and we're back on track, baby. (BOB AND LINDA GRUNTING) BOB: Okay, I gotta think. I don't wanna breathe all of our oxygen. LINDA: Oh! BOB: Yeah, not to scare anybody, but, um, don't breathe too much. LINDA: I'm gonna stop breathing. You kids breathe my air. (INHALES DEEPLY) BOB: No, Lin, just... LINDA: (EXHALES) Oh, God. That's hard. How long was that? LOUISE: Like, five minutes. TINA: I think I could breathe less if it wasn't so dark. GENE: I have something that will make people breathe less. ALL: Oh, Gene. I'm sorry, it's a fear fart. LOUISE: Oh! I have my Kuchi Kopi night light. ALL: Ah! No. Ah. No. Ugh! Stay on, Kuchi. It's your one job! GENE: This is like the worst rave. (GROVER HUMMING) Sorry, sorry, sorry. Bye. Well, he's officially my least favorite cousin. What about Baxter? He's dead. Yeah, but he's still the worst. That's true. Okey dokey. Submarine launch, check. All right. Fuse. So glad I made a to-do list. (SNORTS) Damn it. Oh, good. Oh, my God. (HUMMING) Yep. (SCATTING) ♪♪ I'm doin' it ♪♪ I'm doin' it I'm doin' it ♪♪ (BOB GRUNTING) BOB: I can't break it. LOUISE: This is all my fault. Well, don't everybody speak at once. LINDA: No, honey, it's not your fault. That much. LOUISE: It is though. I wanted to track down the killer and save the restaurant and prove... (SIGHS) prove I wasn't a baby. Oh! Now you come on. Oh, my baby. I mean, sorry. No, stupid Chloe Barbash was right. I am a baby. I was too scared to go in the hole, I was too scared to open the secret nipple door. Tina had to do it for me, and I wear these frickin' ears. I mean, if you're brave, you don't have to prove you're brave. You just are brave. BOB: What? Louise, you're brave. You're one of the bravest people I know. LOUISE: It's not true. Also, you don't know that many people. BOB: Hmm. LOUISE: I've never been brave. Come on, the ears? The only reason I got these in the first place was because I was scared. BOB: What? LINDA: What do you mean? LOUISE: You know. You gave them to me 'cause I was scared about the first day of preschool. That's not how it happened. I mean, you were nervous, and we had this idea to make you the hat. Your mother made it. It's sort of in honor of my mom, your grandmother. She used to wear this brightly-colored winter hat. Even in warm weather. It was a little weird. But it was kinda cute, I guess. She always said it was 'cause she didn't feel like doing her hair. I think she just liked it. And I had extra material, so, uh, rabbit ears. But I made them after your first day at preschool. To celebrate. Because you were so brave. LOUISE: Really? I was? BOB AND LINDA: Yeah. BOB: Do you not remember it that way? LOUISE: No. BOB: Yeah, you didn't need them. LINDA: You were plenty brave, with no hat at all. We were so proud of you. You slapped a kid. LOUISE: I did? LINDA: Yeah. Probably for a good reason, let's say. BOB: You remind me of my mom, Louise. And with the hat, it's kinda like you two have met. I keep forgetting that you never did. GENE: I wore that bucket on my head for a while. Any fun stories about that? BOB: No, I don't remember any. We were concerned. LOUISE: Well, thanks. For the hat and stuff. BOB: Yep. Glad we could clear that up, since we're dying. (ALL GROAN) I mean, since we're just hanging out, alive, under the ground. I'm gonna push on the window with my head. (THUD) Ow! (GRUNTING) This is not working. LINDA: That's it then. We're goners. BOB: Wait, no, don't you give up. LINDA: I'm tired, Bob. BOB: No, you never give up. I give up. And then you say, "don't give up." And I say, "okay," and then we do that over and over, and now that I'm saying it out loud, that can't be fun for you. Oh, God, do you want a divorce before we die? I don't deserve you. LINDA: Nah, I can stick it out. BOB: Listen to me, I'm gonna do for you what you do for me. I am not giving up. We are gonna get outta here. I am gonna Linda this. ALL: Whoa! Dad, are you Fonzie? Yeah, you made the little koko puffs go on. BOB AND LOUISE: Kuchi Kopi. Koochi Koochi? No. Well, the light's helpful, because we are gonna get out of here. How? In a really cool way that's gonna come to us. I mean, we're in a car, kind of. What if we drive? Where? Down? Like, to China? I like it. I like it. Not to China. But no bad ideas. I mean... Oh. Down. What if we do drive down? LINDA: What? We're on top of the water main. The new section of pipe is plastic. We lost a tire. Maybe metal grinding against plastic. Metal wins? Grinding like sexy dancing? What's that? Never mind. Go on. So the wheel breaks the pipe, and the water gets us out somehow? Or it could do the other thing water does. Hot Tub Time Machine? No. Drown us. Oh, well, I never saw the movie, so... (SIGHS) I think this is our only chance. I'm turning it on. (ENGINE REVVING) Oh, Bobby, kids, I want you all to know how much I love you. I love you too, Mom. I love all you mama-jamas. I love all of you, too. We don't have to, like, do any kind of order, why even bring that up? Okay, I'm worried the "I love yous" are the kind of thing you say when we're gonna die, and we are not gonna die! (ACCELERATING) Bob! Linda! Are you up there? Oh, looks like they started filling in your hole. Not well, at all. Jeesh, they just kind of shoved some dirt in there... (YELPS) What the... (ALL GRUNT, LAUGH) BOB: It worked. TINA: Yes. Oh, my sweet babies. So glad we're not dead. I'm happy. I'm thrilled. You guys, the Fischoeders, in the submarine, with the wharf falling on them. What do we do? What do we do? (GRUNTS) It's still stuck. (ALL GRUNTING) (KNOCK ON WINDOW) ALL: (MUFFLED) Teddy! Teddy, help us outta here. (MUFFLED) The thing won't open. Did you guys get a new car? I've never seen this before. (MUFFLED) Have I seen this before? Teddy, we need you to help us open this. The thing is stuck. This thing is stuck. (MUFFLED) It's stuck. (MUFFLED) Argh! I can't open it. What'd he say? I do not know. So, bad news, the burger cart fell apart. It was just too beautiful for this world. (INDISTINCT, MUFFLED SPEAKING) Nothing. No idea what he's saying. Oh! LOUISE: Well, Teddy left. (PANTING) Long story. I'll tell you later. (GROVER GRUNTS, PANTS) (BOB GRUNTING) (YELLING) Olive bar! (GRUNTING) What did he say? Olive bar. Yah! BOB: Yes. LOUISE: Yes. GENE: Wham-bam, goodbye, clam. Thank you, Teddy. Olive bar! Yeah, yeah. No, I know. Dad, you have a pee spot. That's not a pee spot. It's from water. See? All the water? But thanks, Tina. It's right where a pee spot would be. And no other parts are wet. Um, okay. So, Teddy, call the police. Kids, stay here. Uh, Linda, stay with the kids. I'm gonna run down to the wharf, and try and help the Fischoeders not get killed. Um, good plan. (PANTING) Wait, why are you following me? We're not. Okay, but you are. No, we're not. Bye, Bob. Yeah, and maybe mind your own business, Dad? Hello? Is this the police? I'd like to report a thing. A thing happened. You need more than that? Hold on. My good friend, Linda's gonna talk to you. She's married to my best friend. Hello? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Climbing through the window. Hmm? Hmm? Oh. Come on, someone moved the thing? (SIGHS) I do have three-hour gym body. (GRUNTS, YELPS) (THUD) TEDDY: Grover Fischoeder wants to destroy the whole pier? LOUISE: Yeah, to build a mega-park. LINDA: With gift shops. TEDDY: Oh, gift shops. LINDA: I know, but not worth it, right? TEDDY: Yeah, no. Right, right, right. BOB: Where's the fuse? Where's the fuse? Where's the fuse? There! BOB: Oh, my God. All right. Give me your night light for a sec. I'm gonna see if I can climb down. I didn't even know I was still holding it. I guess I need a night light everywhere I go. That's great. Louise. It's fine, it's fine. Don't mess him up. Oh. LINDA: That is terrifying. Yeah, you'd think it would be comforting. Everybody, please get out of here. LINDA: Bob, don't do it. I don't want you to catch on fire. I don't think you'd like it. Just get away from the wharf. Don't worry. I'll be fine. I can make it. Okay, you're too positive right now. Maybe take it down a notch? Big jump! (GRUNTS) Ow. Look at him go. I mean, kind of. He's not used to this much physical... Um, Dad, go faster. GENE: Do you need your workout mix? If you had one? (GRUNTS) No, I'm good. Thank you. (WHIRRING) Dad! Dad, get off the track. I'm gonna ride the ride down. Louise! Not the best time for going on rides. Louise, no. It's too dangerous. LOUISE: Dad, you're not gonna make it in time. But the track goes right past the fuse. I'm gonna grab it when I go by. No, I'm gonna make it. I'm starting to get good at this. Oh! Oh, boy. Oh. Oh, my God. Come on, Mole. Don't be so slow. Still faster than you, Dad, though. No offense. Yeah, but there's a wicked turn coming up. There it is. Oh, Louise, be careful. Don't get decapitated and then burned up. I won't. Whoa! Dad, you look like you're about to climb right in front of me? Nope, I'm gonna leap across really quickly. (GRUNTS) Oh, God. Not that quickly. Get off the track! (BOB GRUNTS) BOB: Oh, it's getting close to the animals. Okay, got it. If you miss, we won't have a second chance. I know. Very helpful info. Thank you. BOB: You might have been right about your way being faster. I mean, just a lot of beams. This place is over-engineered, I think. I'm excited to talk about this with you later. Come on, little arms. (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (STRAINING) (YELPS) (GASPS) Oh, no. Oh, God. (GRUNTING) (GASPS) Did you get it? Or are we all dead? (GRUNTS) Yes. ALL: Yeah! I did it? I did it! (LAUGHS TRIUMPHANTLY) I'm brave! I'm brave! LINDA: You sure are, honey. I am brave! And super humble! Hey, Dad! Good work to both of you. (PANTING) Thank you. Thank you. I'm gonna miss that pier. And being alive. And you, my friend. Aw. Got ya. Ow! You owe me a thousand dollars. Let's play for two. Switch. I'm gonna miss you too, pal. I've always looked up to... Got ya. Poop it. (GRUNTS) Play for three? Got ya. Ow! I hope you suffocate first. (THUD) That's interesting. I wonder if that's a giant squid trying to mate withus. Well, it could do a lot worse.

Ooh, uh, Teddy, can I borrow your phone real quick? Uh, here. Yeah, sure. (GASPS) Are you ordering takeout? Can we get traditional Thai street food from that new place? No, I'm not ordering takeout. Sorry. Oh, boo. Yeah, a lot of people think of Robbery as kind of the coolest division, you know? Where the cool cops work. (CELL PHONE RINGS) I don't know if that's true. But, uh, you know, lot of people think it. Hello. Bye, front desk person. You were here when I came in three hours ago, weren't you? I remember your, uh, shirt. (CHUCKLES) You probably remember me too, right? This face? You're not looking up. There you go. You remember this ugly mug, right? You have earbuds in. Did you hear anything I said? Oh, you did. Good. Anyway, this is Grover Fischoeder saying good night. (SIRENS WAIL) Hi, there. First on the scene. No biggie. I beat you. And you. I beat you too. (WHISPERS) Crap. (FITZ GRUNTING RHYTHMICALLY) (PASSENGERS LAUGHING AND SCREAMING) Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. How're you feeling, buddy? You nervous? Oh, no. It just feels like my insides are fighting to get out of my bottom hole. Hey, listen, you're gonna be great. Uh-huh. Or we're gonna be bad and insides out on stage. You know, I heard you guys practicing in the basement when I was cleaning up last night. You did? Yeah. And you sounded great. Parts were great. And your music, it makes you happy, right? Yeah. Well, it's gonna make other people happy, too. So maybe you should be un-stop-timistic about it. Mom says that. Yeah. So, you're stealing. I say it now, too. Also, she's helping Tina with her wig, so I have to try and say what she would say. Take her material. Yes. Come here. (GRUNTS) Thanks, Dad! Just have fun up there.

Thanks to our very grateful landlord. I still think he's not grateful enough. That's true. He could be even more grateful. But still, signing it. This doesn't look right. Is that my signature? Uh, let's just say yes. So there, we did it, Mr. Bank. (GRUNTS) Please don't call me Mr. Bank. Sorry. People aren't usually so cocky when they make their very late loan payments. Well, get used to it. One more. (GRUNTS) Ow. (PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC) Hey, Tina. Oh, hey, Jimmy Jr. Happy last day of school. Thanks. You too. So, I was doing parkour down on the beach with Zeke, we're really good at parkouring, or I'm really good at parkouring. Anyway, I found this. (GASPS) It made me think of you. Maybe because you have the same kind of barrette. Do you want it? It smells like seaweed. Jimmy Jr.? Yeah? There's something I wanted to ask you. Something summer boyfriend-related. But then I thought maybe it was a stupid question for anyone to ask anyone ever. (ZEKE GRUNTS) And my heart was an idiot... Oh. ZEKE: Rolling, rolling. I'm doing parkour off the locker, Jay-Ju. You see me? It looked a little awkward, Zeke. I'm working on it! Yow-za! (LAUGHS) You fell off the wall. Yeah, what am I looking at here? ZEKE: Parkour! Uh, what were you saying? Oh, I was saying, I thought my heart was an idiot. But then you found my barrette-clace. And now it kinda makes me think maybe there's only no romance in the world if you believe there's no romance in the world. And who wants to believe that? Uh... Now, I don't know why I got so hung up on the question I was gonna ask anyway. Mostly, I just really wanna do this. (BOTH MOANING) Whoa. Yeah. (BAND CONTINUES PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC) CHLOE: You're not gonna do it. LOUISE: I'm gonna do it. You think because you, like, saved the wharf or something, you're all brave now? Yeah. On three. One, two, three. (ALL GASP) Your hat fell off. LOUISE: Hmm? Oh, yeah. Louise, reminding you that you have detention today because you skipped school. Oh, my God, your ears fell off! Okay. It's okay. What do we do? What do we do? It's fine. It's not a big deal. Emergency counsel session? I can get puppets here so fast. Ms. Labonz, will you go to my office and get Security Blanket Hank and, oh, just get them all. No. Mr. Frond, I'm good. Oh, really? MS. LaBONZ: She's good. Okay. I'm so proud of you. LOUISE: Don't say "you're so proud of me." Yep. Is everybody ready to do this again? LINDA: Yeah. GENE: Sure, Father. LOUISE: I mean, it seems like you're making us. Teddy did a good job. Kind of. Right? LINDA: Aw, banner. I love banners. GENE: Are we dead set on "Burgers"? I mean, is it too late to change that? TINA: Oh, yeah. We could do wraps. LOUISE: Or soup. BOB: Mm. LINDA: Mm, soup. GENE: Bob's Soup and Wraps has a certain sound to it. BOB: Oh, my God. Everyone, back inside, back inside. Never mind. KIDS: Thank you, Wonder Wharf! (CHEERING) GENE: What a journey! (CHEERING) Yeah! All right! Finally. Now, we can bring out Johnny Jazz Hands. Oh, goody. (UPBEAT SOUL SONG PLAYING) (GRUNTING AND PANTING) JIMMY JR.: Uh, Tina, it's a little crowded, isn't it? TINA: No, it's fine. Shh, shh. JIMMY JR.: Okay. It's just that I... (GRUNTS)
