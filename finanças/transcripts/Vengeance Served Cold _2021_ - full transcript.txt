I hope Mama does not take long humping this man. I'm so hungry I'd eat her terrible cooking. Yes, baby, that was good. Did I do it for you, honey? Nothing to write home about. You young boys don't know the difference between steak and pork chops. Yeah, well. Give me the $40 you owe me. Take this 20. I was expecting better. What do you think this is, some project discount? It is what I say it is. We agreed on 40. My mind may be scrambled from dope, but it still calculates numbers. Give me what you owe me. Shoot, 20, 40? It's all change to me. We agreed on 40. Last time I checked, 20 plus 20 equals 40. Give me what you owe me or else. Or else? Sound like a threat. You don't understand. I work for this money. I need to get my fix. You don't understand, give me what you owe me, now! Yo, yo, you better get off me. Give me my money! What the hell? Give me my money! Here's this twenty trick, take it. Trick! Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God. Mama? Mama? Mama, Mama. Mama, wake up! Mama? Mama, wake up! Mama? Mama, Mama? As God is I witness, I'm gonna make him pay for what he's done to you. Madison, what do you want at this ungodly hour? I'm sorry for waking you, but I need to speak to Lydia. It's important. Do you realize it's six o'clock in the morning? I know. That's why I'm begging. I need Lydia's help. She's sleeping in. I need to talk to her. Please. All right, come in. Have a seat. Lydia, are you awake? I am now. Well, Madison is here to see you, and it seems urgent. Okay, I'm getting up. Well, I'm going back to bed. We'll be quiet. I'll make her something to eat, if that's okay. That's fine. Just clean up your mess when you're done. Gracias, Mommy. I love you. I love you more. Now, I'm going back to sleep. I'm scared. Did your mom get arrested again? No, it's worse than that. It's okay, you can ask my mom to help like she did last time. This is different. There's nothing you or your parents can do for her. She's dead. He killed her with his bare hands. Who's dead? Who killed her? My mother is dead. He killed her. I saw everything. Whoa. I'll go get my mom. Mom? Hi, my name is Maria Lopez. Officer Mitchell, responding to a possible homicide? Yes, Madison came upstairs and told us what happened. Sharon's in the apartment. Okay. Will you take me to the scene? Sure, follow me. All right. Dispatch, this is Officer Mitchell, badge number 6606, responding to a possible 192. I have a deceased female found on the scene, late 30s, early 40s. Please notify the homicide squad and send over some detectives to interview the witnesses. Copy that. Homicide's been notified. The detectives will be en route shortly. Copy that, I'm gonna go ahead and secure the scene, over. Hello, I'm Detective Straker, and this is my partner, Detective Hash. We're from the homicide unit. Please come in. Thank you. This is the victim's daughter, Madison Michaels. Hello, young lady. Can you state your name for the record please? Madison, Madison Michaels. Hello, Madison. I'm Detective Hash. My partner and I need to ask you a few questions. What do you want to know? What's your mother's full name? Sharon Michaels. Can you tell us what happened in the apartment? Mama brought home another man. I've seen him around here before, but I don't know him. Do you know his name? Renegade is what everyone calls him. I don't know his real name. How does this Renegade look? Is he tall, short, slim? Does he have any distinguishing marks? He's tall, like you. Brown skin, short hair with scary tattoos on his arms and chest. Madison, what happened? I saw everything. Okay, that's it. Hasn't she been through enough already? You guys can come back another time. I totally understand. She's been through a lot. If she remembers anything, anything at all, let me give you my card. You could bring her down to the station, if you like. Thank you, Madison. You've been a brave girl. You may not think so, but you've been very helpful. We're gonna do everything we can to catch this Renegade. Thank you. Let me show you guys out. Good morning, ladies, my name is Madison Michaels. We gotta be at the meth clinic before 10. Well excuse me for taking up your time to share life-changing information. Life-changing? If I don't get a hit of something and soon, you're gonna have a problem. Hush your mouth, or I'll hush it for you. Show Miss Madison some respect. We're here to focus on your needs. House of Hope has helped thousands of women. And we can help you too. Y'all can't help me. There's no help for the hopeless. Just give us a chance and hear me out. What if we don't wanna give you or this place a chance? What if? Yeah, what if? All right. Let's start by removing what if from our vocabulary. I wasted many years wondering what if. How so? What if my father hadn't left my mom? What if my mom hadn't turned to drugs? What if my mom hadn't turned to prostitution? Or what if I hadn't witnessed my mom's murder? I was 15 years old when I witnessed my mother's murder. I heard inaudible yelling. I came out to see what was going on. And there he was. Her last trick. Shoving something down her throat with one hand and choking her with the other. And I watched in fear as my mother fought and struggled for her life. Your mother was a prostitute? I can't believe that. Well, yes, but she wasn't always. When my dad walked out on us, things got tough. You women need to hear every bit of this story. Because if you don't change your lives today, right now, you could fall prey to a murderer, bad dope or incarceration. No, no, that won't happen to me. My pimp got my back. He'll take down anyone who tries to harm me. Your pimp won't be with you all the time. Yes, he will. If you have a drug addiction, House of Hope will help you get into rehab. And then we'll enroll you in school after rehab and help you find honest work. Sign up for the program, and we'll do the rest. How can I walk away? My pimp will come looking for me, and he will kill me. House of Hope has a contract with a rehab facility in southern New Jersey. And the school we're contracted with is also located in New Jersey. We'll relocate you. But you have to be willing to go. So if I don't go to rehab, I have to go to jail? That's exactly where you'll go if you don't go to rehab. I mean, I can't imagine anybody choosing incarceration. Yeah, I can't go to jail. I'm claustrophobic. I'll suffocate in a tight cell. The choice is yours. Sue will be by the van. If you wanna sign up for the program, we'll see you out back. If you don't, we'll see you in 18 months. Some of you, if you survive jail. I don't want help from any of you. I wanna go back on the streets. I didn't even ask to come here. Unfortunately, you have two choices to make. And none of them, none, includes going back to the boulevard. You either have rehab or jail. You have less than 10 minutes to decide your fate. I don't know about the rest of you, but I think this program is a go for me. When you finish the program, you can come back and sit in on any one of the meetings. And you can inspire someone to change their lives for the better. I'm ready too. Ladies, let's do this together. I'm willing to walk away from my past. Are you? Who's with me? I see some of you would rather live behind bars. For those of you standing, please make your way out back and wait by the van. Sue, we can't save everyone. We can only try to convince them. It appears as if they've already made up their minds. I tried. I'll see you out back. For those of you who wish to change your mind, the time is now. I'll wait five more minutes. If you wanna change your mind, get up and go meet Sue and the others out back. I can assure you, the bus ride will be a bumpy one. 90 days and I'll be out of rehab? Yes, but you have to enroll into school afterwards. The GED course takes four weeks and four weeks of skills program. Five months of your life for a new start. Megan, let's do this. I'm not built for jail. I spent two weeks on Rikers, and it was the worst experience of my life. Grace, I don't think I can stop prostituting. This is all I now. I will fail at anything else I try. Oh, Jesus. It's okay to have doubts. But give the program a shot and prove your fears wrong. You can do this. All you have to do is try. Let's go before I change my mind. Um, hi, my name is Madison Michaels. I'm here to see Detective Straker. Do you have an appointment? No, but I have new evidence in the cold case of Sharon Michaels. All right, give me a sec. Yeah, we have a, uh... Miss Michaels. We have a Miss Michaels here. She says she has new evidence in one of your cold cases. Mm-hm. All right, will do. All right, you're good to go. Down the hall, to your left. Thank you. I know where it is. I gotta go. Got a client, bye. Madison, it's been a while. Good to see you. You too. Sorry to hear about Detective Hash. He was a good cop. A good man, too. He died heroically in the line of duty, how unfortunate. It seems like bad things tend to happen to good people. You know, one of the prostitutes from rehab today said Renegade is her pimp. He physically abuses her all the time. Sounds like to me you're in the wrong department. I don't handle domestic violence. Officer Clark says you have new evidence in your mother's case? I do. What is it? This is my evidence. Doesn't this prove that he's violent? Doesn't his abuse prove that he's capable of murder? Yes, it proves that he's violent He may very well be capable of murder, but that doesn't prove anything in your mother's case. This is absurd. I can't believe you're discounting this information. Is there anything that can be done to him? He can be arrested for domestic violence, if the woman comes forward and press charges against him. She's in rehab. I've tried to convince her to come forward before, but she's afraid. Okay, can I press charges against him in her defense? The only thing you can do, if he physically attacks you, the victim has to come forward and file. Is there someone else I can talk to, maybe in another department? You can talk to Detective Mitchell in Special Victims Unit. He handles all domestic violence and rape cases. He may be able to assist you. I wanna talk to him right now, immediately. I'll see if he's in. Good morning, this is Detective Straker from the homicide unit. Is Detective Mitchell in this morning? Great, I have a young lady here by the name of Madison Michaels requesting his assistance. I'll send her down. Where is his office? Downstairs, past the front desk, take the first left. Thank you. Sorry I couldn't do more. Each unit is territorial. Heads'll roll if I step outta my lane. You know, I'm tired of hearing I'm sorry, but it's okay. I'll get justice for my mom someday, one way or another. Miss Michaels. You have to be careful with your words. I am a officer of the law. I'll pretend I didn't hear that. You have a nice day. Oh, hello. Please, come have a seat. Can I help you? I'm a counselor at the House of Hope. Olivia Flanders, a prostitute from the program, confided in me about her pimp physically abusing her. I would like to press charges against him. That's impossible. He beats her like a dog. Have you witnessed it? No, but I have her word and I believe her. I mean, she got a black eye, a busted lip and old bruises. Someone is beating her. Let me tell you how the law works in this situation. You're not the victim, so you cannot press charges. In fact, the only way you can have this guy put into jail is if you witness the abuse and then you call it in right while it's happening. I witnessed my mother's murder. And the man responsible is still free. Now I can have a killer arrested for domestic violence, but not for murder? Ma'am, ma'am, please calm down. And just go back a bit. Did you say he's a murderer and you witnessed the act? I saw this very man take my mother's life 10 years ago, and he's still free. The law better do something about him soon before someone else does. Ma'am. Lydia, I don't know what else to do. I'm so furious about this guy getting away with everything. Listen, don't get yourself all riled up over something you have no control over. Ooh, do you know where we're going? Yeah, House of Hope. Listen, I'm just gonna do my own investigative work, because the police obviously aren't gonna do anything without Olivia pressing charges. Listen, you can't do that. I suggest you think things through. What if he hurts you or, even worse, kills you? I don't care. I mean, he's already gotten away with murder, and now this? Don't do this. You have to think things through. Okay, I wouldn't be able to live with myself if something happens to you. You're my best friend. I'm not changing my mind, and I don't have to think about anything. He's gonna pay for what he's done to my mom and every other woman he's ever hurt. Now you sound like a woman on a mission. I know what you're like once you have your mind set on things. Listen, let's just talk to Mom first. Ask her for her input. She's never steered us wrong. I'm not talking to anyone. No, it's been 10 years and he hasn't paid yet. But he's gonna pay, and soon. Mom, Madison's gonna do something drastic. We have to convince her not to. What is this nonsense about Madison doing something? She plans to go after Renegade. She's beyond reason, and I believe she's gonna do it this time. Where is she? I heard her tell the cab driver that she was gonna be a couple blocks down from the House of Hope. I don't know. I'll meet you there. We need to talk to her before it's too late. Okay, I'll meet you there in 15 minutes. Bye. Madison, may we have a word with you? Lydia, you can't keep your mouth shut about anything. We're just here to talk. Don't be angry. Have a seat. No, we're gonna stand because we're gonna be brief. I'm not changing my mind. My decision is final, okay. I'm going to the boulevard tonight, because Olivia told me where to find Renegade. Oh my goodness, I can't allow you to do that. It's too dangerous. That's suicide. You don't know what it's like to go to bed at night and relive her murder over and over again. You're right, I don't know. But I do know that you're making a bad decision, and it just might cost you your life. But what do you want... Girls, please calm down. Madison, have you gone to the police and asked for their advice? I was told that there's nothing that I can do. Olivia has to press charges. Have you told them that Renegade is responsible for your mother's death? Did you talk to Detective Straker about your plan? Yes, and yes. And Detective Straker told me to leave things in the police's hands. But you both see how well that's going. Well you have to have faith that the police is doing all that they can to catch your mother's killer. This is something that I have to do. The streets aren't safe with that man out there, and I have to take him down by any means necessary. Please, don't go out there tonight. In fact, I want both of you to come to the house for dinner tonight. And Madison, so help me God, if you are not at the house by seven o'clock, I am gonna come out to the boulevard to find you. And Poppy and I will be with her. Now who sounds crazy? All right. I'll be there. Good, I'll let Carlos know that the both of you will be home for dinner tonight. He's gonna be so happy. Lydia, let's get outta here. Madison, I will see you later. I'll see you later, Mom. I love you. I love you too. You better be there. I'll come get you. You better be there. See you later. I wanna call Detective Straker now. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Okay. Detective Straker, Madison's gonna go out on the boulevard tonight. I want you to stop her, because she's gonna get herself killed for certain. I told her to leave everything to the police. I can't believe her stubbornness. Madison and I'll be at my parents' house tonight for dinner. She's gonna make up some excuse why she has to go to the House of Hope. Okay, here's what I want you to do. When she leaves your parents' house, call me. I know where Renegade's turf is. I'll have a few undercover girls work the area. They'll alert me when she shows up. I'll be in touch. He's gonna send a couple undercover officers out there tonight. Great, I'm glad. Hopefully they can keep Madison safe. They'll know what to do. Detective Straker can handle everything. Good, let's get outta here. We need to get to the market before it get a little too crazy. Okay, I'll take you there. - Yes. - Okay. Let's go. Julia, I need you in my office. Can you get me the video camera? I need it for a project that I'm working on. Okay, I'll have to sign it out of the property department. What project is this? I need to reference the information. I wanna do a documentary about streetwalkers, and it's relevant to the work we do here. Okay, I'll have it by the end of the day. Oh, thank you, awesome. Oh and Julia, can you keep this on the hush? I don't want anyone knowing about what I'm doing until the project is final. No problem, I'll be discreet. Hey, Sue? Um. I have a huge favor to ask. Okay, I'm listening. Do you have any plans tonight? I need a ride. It shouldn't be a problem. What time do you want me to meet you, and where? Nine, at Penn Station. Absolutely. I'll do anything to help. I'll see you at nine? All right. See you later. Hey. Hey. So where we headed? To the boulevard. No. No! I can't go there. I need to get Renegade on video. Okay, what if he recognizes you? Okay, so, we're gonna park a few doors down. He won't even know that we're there. For our sake, I hope that he doesn't. Trust me, no one will recognize us. I promise. I can't get caught out there. I can go back to jail. I won't let that happen. Mm-mm, I don't know about this. Oh come on. Listen, I really, really need your help. Lydia won't help me with any of this stuff, okay? Hello, and for good reason. You're not thinking clearly. All right, you know what, just drop me off. I'll get a taxi home. Girl, please. Guilt trip, really? First of all, you'd have to walk a few blocks. And then try to catch a cab because nothing is stopping on the boulevard, not a decent cab driver at that. Why don't you let me worry about that? Are you gonna drop me off or not? Hello? Ugh, I can't believe you have me considering this. Yes, you're the best. Do not get too excited, because the minute I see trouble, the first sign of trouble, I'm out of there. Okay, okay. Adios. Fair enough. Deuces. I know. Come on, let's go. You're the best, girl. Wow. I don't miss the street life. I mean, walking around in six-inch heels and begging for attention. Whew. Girl, you walked away, and that's all that matters. I know, but I do wonder, you know, what if I didn't? You know, what my life would look like. Dead or in prison. There's no other option for the woman who decides to stay on these streets. Yeah, you know, I, I couldn't see that then, but I definitely see that now. Definitely see that now. Gotcha. May I help you? Are you ladies looking for a date? Get lost. No need to be rude. I'm just trying to show you a good time. Okay, like the lady said, we're not interested, okay? Come on, if I go home empty-handed, I'll be in trouble. Trouble, with who? My sugar daddy, he doesn't like when I come home empty-handed. Whose your handler? You're asking a lot of questions. Are you the police or something? - No. - No. We're not the police. Well I am, and you're in the middle of a sting, so if you don't leave, I'll have my partners arrest you for loitering. - No, no. - Okay, we're going. We're fine, we're just sorry. Thank you so much, we appreciate it. That was too close. This is what I'm talking about. This is what I did not want to happen. Dammit! That was too close, okay, Madison? Gosh. Listen, the fact that they're watching and they're out here on a sting means that they might be actually watching Renegade. And I know that you're upset, but this is the opportunity that they might catch him. They better get him. They better get him and soon. I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of this foolishness. Looks like you had a rough night. Make yourself comfortable. I'll make us some tea. You know, I often wonder what my mom would want me to do. You know, she was a good mom, despite her shortcomings. I could see the pain in your eyes. It was that obvious? Back then and now. That's why I took great interest in you. I knew you'd be an aggressive learner. I was, but for the wrong reasons, though. Renegade was, and still is, my motivator. Everyone has a method to their madness. I'm guilty of that. When you shared your mother's story with me, I wanted to annihilate the man in person. Do you think I should forget about all this and just walk away? Sometimes, you need to let go. My question, can you let go of this? Maybe. I don't know. Maybe I should just be realistic, you know. I don't know if I'll have... I don't know if I'll have the courage to kill him if I have the opportunity. I mean, killing a pimp sounds over the top when I say it out loud. I don't know. This is craziness. And craziness sometimes can bring you courage. But it can also make a person decide poorly. The more I think about this, the more I just wanna forget it. Think about your mom, what she would do. In the end, no matter what you do, it's not gonna bring her back. You're right about one thing. It definitely won't bring my mom back. I remember my first kill in the war. I was only 18 years old. Violence was new to me. My troop was under heavy attack, and I rolled out into a bunker. That's when I was face to face with my enemy. He was more scared than me. What did you do? I raised my weapon. I was frightened. He lunged at me, I fired two shots, and it was over. I can't imagine what killing a person could do to your psyche. I lost my lunch, pulled myself together and went right back into the trenches. Found my troops. We made our way back to the designated area. Wow, sounds like it was easy to me. I wouldn't consider killing anyone easy. I mean, years after that I saw that young man's face every time I closed my eyes. And every now and then I still dream about him. You know, I didn't think about that part. I definitely don't need another nightmare. Well, you know what to do. Forgiveness, think about it. He doesn't deserve to be happy. You do. Yeah, but Renegade gotta pay. If you forgive, you'll heal. You will be happy. It's hard for me to let this go. You're gonna have to forgive him. You're gonna have to let it go. You're holding on to something that's so bad for you. It's poison. I have to stop him. Why don't you let karma take care of it? Why don't you move forward with your life and regroup? You're right. And every time I help another woman at the rehab, I feel like I accomplished something, you know? Yeah, maybe I should just let it go. I don't know. I don't know. I'm just... I can't let it go. I can't. Everything is gonna be okay, kiddo. Hello. What? Wait, wait wait wait, wait. Sue is what? How did? Okay, I'm, I'll be there. Donovan, I gotta go. Sue's in the hospital. Madison? What are you? I been trying to call you. Sue's in the hospital. I know. Can I get a ride to the hospital? Come on. What the hell happened? She relapsed, went back on the track. There's a pimp out there. He's been coming at us heavy. Trying to be our man. This is my fault. I asked her to go on a surveillance with me, and... That's how it happens sometimes. You get so caught up you lose yourself. I am so... I am so angry right now. Who did this to her? Renegade. Renegade? Are you sure? He slapped the taste outta my mouth when I tried to help her. I had to scream. Some undercover cops came over to assist us, and he got away. I gotta stop him. I can't let this dude get away with this. I am just so tired of waiting for justice. He coulda, he coulda killed her! I'm going after this dude myself. I want in. Do you see what he did to my face? I can't get any work with my mug busted like this. I'm damaged goods. No. No! This is something that I gotta do alone. And how do you plan on doing that? You're not Superwoman. He'll stop you before you even get started. No, uh-uh, this is personal, okay? This is personal, so see yourself outta this equation. Look at me! This makes it personal. I don't know what you have planned, but I want in, and I'm not taking no for an answer. Okay, all right, I'll let you help me. But, if you ever, ever have any kinda problems, you can forget about the whole thing, because I'm doing this my way. Agreed. What do you have planned? All right, he wanna pimp you, right? And that's exactly we'll lead him to believe. He asked me out on a date several times. He wanted to test me to make sure I was a good moneymaker. I could do a little show and tell. So, we're gonna get a hotel, close to the boulevard. I'll tell him one of my girls from Cali just came in, and she's looking for a sugar daddy too. I'm that girl from Cali. He don't know what I look like. He'll be all over that. He's not gonna know what hit him. I'm bringing my boxcutter. You can bring your weapon of choice. I got something else in mind. I'll be ready for him. I'll make sure we get a room close to the exit. That's gonna be a quick, you know, exit route. Okay, so I'll drop you at the hospital. Okay, let's do it. Do the back for me. I think you should do the introduction, because I don't wanna come off too, you know, he may pick up on something. - I'll pull up. - Okay. Tell him I messed up, I realized I messed up. I'll hit him with the, sorry, Daddy, the whole I'm sorry, Daddy, speech. I've learned my lesson. Yeah, and then I will step in and introduce myself as Callie. But, listen, he's gonna touch you. And if you flinch or jump, he's gonna know, he's gonna be on to us. Girl, I oughta just slit his throat right there. Let him find out that I was the queen of the blade. You been carving turkeys? Yeah. Don't worry, I can handle myself. I got me a gun. I like bringing a gun to a knife party. That's right. Oh. I like the advantage of distance. Honey, in my business, I don't have the advantage of distance. I know all about up close and personal. Let's just, let's just go. Let's just go do this. Come on. I'm ready. - Come on. - Come on. Some of the baddest broads ever. You getting outside later and later though, bro. Hey, I just get to to the pavement, you know what I'm saying? I gotta handle what I gotta handled, you know what I'm saying? Okay. Okay, just make sure you're here, man. I got you, I got you. I aint never gonna slip, I aint never gonna slip. Well, well, well, what do we have here? Damn, pretty little thing ready to drop it like it's hot for you. Daddy, can I bend your ear for a minute? Trick it better be worth my while. Oh, you definitely gonna wanna hear what I got to say. I brought you a peace offering. Mm. Ooh. A two-for-one deal, now that's what I'm talking about. Hey, yo, you need some help, you let me know, because I'm willing and able. My deal is with you and you only, Daddy. What's your name? This is Cali. She just flew in from the West Coast a few days ago. Looking for protection. Well come here, baby. Let me take a look at you. Ooh, damn, you fine. I want someone to take care of me, you know, watch my back. Mm. Well? Will you watch my back, Daddy? All right, well, show me some. Not here, baby. Why don't you come to the Blue Sky Motel? Room 214. In an hour, I'm gonna show you everything I've got. We'll show you everything, if you can handle both of us. Two. All right, well, let me handle things out here, and I'll be there. - Okay, thank you. - Okay, all right. I can't wait to give you what you deserve. Can't wait. - Damn. - You gonna love it. All of it. Oh yeah? Yes, let's go, Cali. Okay, okay. I like how that sound. Word. I like how that sound, man. I'm on it, you heard. All right, hey look, make sure y'all put something sexy on, though, you heard? Right, right, right. Are you ready to do this? I can't wait to see the look on his ugly face when my cold steel cuts into that dirty flesh. Hey, don't get too overzealous, okay, this is my fight. Let's go have a drink. You need a drink. We can't. You gotta have a clear head when you come face to face with Renegade, I know what he's capable of. Okay, I need a drink. Don't have one. I need a drink. Come on, walk with me to the liquor store. We're gonna go over the plan. Whatever gets you off better not get us killed. I'm gonna have one sip. Does that put your nervous mind at ease? Somebody's at the door. Who is it? I'm looking for Sunshine. What is he doing here? I don't know, but we gotta get rid of him. I'm gonna hide in the closet. Get him outta here. Get him out. What's up? Open the door, I wanna see you. What are you doing here? I sent for Renegade. You really thought he was gonna come for you? You better leave now, or you gonna have a serious problem. Ooh, I'm scared. Just shut up and give me what you was gonna give Renegade. You know what, come in.

Can you answer that question for me? I'll call Detective Straker when Renegade is dead in the street. All I'm concerned about is not letting Renegade hurt anybody else. Detective Straker handles homicides. I'll give him a case to investigate. I don't want your help, okay. I can't risk getting you hurt like Sunshine. You have to understand. Lydia, please, understand.

I shot a man, okay. You shot someone, what? Yes. He was with Renegade, okay. I'm going to Donovan's. I... Stop, stop, Madison. I'm leaving tonight. Sit down. Let me talk to you for a minute. What do you mean you shot someone? You actually shot a person? Yes. Yes. Okay, well, did you kill him? I don't know, Lydia. Well how can you be for sure? Because, I wasn't trying to kill him. Okay, hey, listen, calm down. Okay, here's your phone. It's okay for you to go to Donovan's, okay. Madison, what am I gonna do with you? We're gonna get through this. Lydia, remember, if anyone asks, you haven't seen or heard from me. I know, I know, go now, before I lose my nerve. Madison? I love you. I love you too. Homicide, Detective Straker. Hi, this is Lydia, Lydia Lopez. This is Madison's sister. How may I help you? Madison shot someone. She's gonna get herself killed. She's obsessed. She's crazed. Who was shot, and where did it happen? One of Renegade's partners down on the boulevard. Where's Madison? She's actually on her way to Donovan's. Please, don't even tell her that I called you. She'll be furious with me. Okay, don't worry, I won't say a thing. Do you know where Donovan's cabin's at? You know what. I'll just text it to you. I'll text you everything you need to know. Just please look after her, take care of her. I'll do what I can to help her. No problem. I'll take care of it. Okay, thank you so much. Yo, where is she, man? It's about time this trick be taught a lesson, man. She's heading upstate. I got the location. Let's go. If we leave now, we'll get there after she does. Hold up, hold up, hold up. We? Nah, Bro. I'm taking care of this trick by myself, man. Pfft. You'll be dead by morning. Donovan's ex-military. You aint getting on his property. So how we get the girl, man? I'll go first, talk to her. She'll come out. I'll act like it's an investigation. She trusts me. She'll never know a thing. I'll jump out a few feet away. You go get the girl, stop and get me, and we out. She'll suspect something if I stop in the middle of the road. Donovan will be watching my every move until I'm off the property. Yo, man, you better figure something out, Officer. Look, I'll leave you at the entrance of the property. Donovan cannot see that far down the road. All right, let's go. I wasn't expecting you until next weekend. What happened? I shot someone. Give me the gun. I'll get rid of it for you. It wasn't even Renegade. I wish it was Renegade. Yeah, me too. Who was it? One of his goons. He was hanging with. Where were you when you shot this person? On the boulevard. I... I took his car. What? I took his car, and I left it in the alley by my apartment building. Don't give me that look, come on. I don't know what I was thinking, okay? Yeah, I don't either. Did you tell anybody? I told Lydia. Lydia. She said she wouldn't say anything to anybody, okay. I trust her. So much for her not saying anything. We have a guest. What are we gonna do? Madison, I need you to come with me to the station. Sue died an hour ago. No! No. I'm sorry. No, no. It's okay, it's all right. No. Can't this wait? No, I'll try to make it as brief as possible. Just come down to the station, and we'll get it done, quick and easy. I'll come with you. No, I'll go, I'll go. Just let me lock the place up. I'll go. I'll go. I'm tired of losing the people that I love. Sorry, I can only ride with her. Rules and regulations. Go with him. Just remember, I'm always watching over you. Don't worry. She's in good hands. She'll call you as soon as we're done. So, did you arrest Renegade for Sue's murder? Yes, sure. Okay. Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you I was gonna kill you? Didn't I? Take her down! What are you waiting for? Take her down! Come on, stop playing! Oh my God. Take her down! Take her out! Oh, you's a tough one, huh? Come on, stop playing! Not used to people fighting back, huh? It was a lucky shot. Take her down. Quit playing. If you want something done right, do it yourself. Remember that woman you killed over $20? That was my mother. You, killed, my mother. You ruined my life. Madison, Madison, Madison, Madison, Madison. You got him. You have to go. I'll handle this mess. I think I'm gonna be sick. Clean yourself up first. You're not gonna be sick. You did good. It's all over now. It still hurts. It's like the pain doesn't go away. Wait. Revenge served cold, numbs you. The pain in your life comes back with the feeling. Lydia. Lydia knows. Lydia knows. What if she called the cops? Just go. I'll fix everything here. Go home. Thank you. Thank you. Oh gosh. What in the world happened to you? You should see my opponent. But that's all over now. It looks like it hurts. I'm a lot tougher than you think. Trust me, I'll be fine. Well, I came to apologize. I was stupid. I'm sorry. It's all good. It's okay. I just, I couldn't help myself. Why don't you just sign up for the program? That's how you can repay me. That's not who I am. What I do makes the community better. Come on. You won't regret it, trust me. You need to sign up for the program. I'll do it, but don't get mad when I go reclaim my post back on the boulevard. You won't. Believe me, you won't. How's Sue? Yeah, she's doing good. She's recovering well. I still can't believe Renegade did that to her. Yeah. Well, I got some good news to give her that's gonna make her feel so much better. I'd like to hear it. I wanna hear some good news. Let's just say he won't be hurting anyone else. Ever. That's the best news I've heard in a long time. Sue! Come here, ah, God. Sue. Well come here. When did you get outta the hospital? Three days ago. Oh my gosh, I'm so happy to see you back on your feet. Limping on it. You tough like me. I try. How are you? I'm sore. But I'll live, you know. I still can't believe that this happened to me, you know. Yeah. You didn't deserve that, Sue. You didn't. Well if it's any consolation, that bastard paid for what he did to you. I guess you'll rest better now that he has. Oh yes, I'm resting, girl. We should go out and celebrate. I'm gonna take a rain check on that. You know, I can't move. I have a better idea. Why don't you sign up for the program? You never quit. Mm-mm, no, she doesn't. Never has and never will. I mean, that's what makes Madison special. If I didn't know any better, I'd think you're complimenting me. You're welcome. So good to see you, Sue. You okay? No, I'm not. I'm here for you. I know, Lydia. I'm just tired of all the bullshit. Were you expecting someone? It's probably Philip from next door. He's always locking himself out. Oh my God, Lydia. You let that creepy guy in here on your days off? Madison, just relax. It's all right, he's not so bad, okay. Oh my gosh! Where's Renegade? Oh my gosh. He's not here. I'm talking to Little Miss Cali. Her name isn't Miss Cali. You have the wrong person. You're mistaken. Keep talking, I'm gonna snap her neck. Please, I'm begging you. Let me go. I see Renegade and know he good, then I'll let you go. Okay, okay, I'll take you to him on one condition. Yeah. I'll go with you, and she stays here. I aint a idiot. You aren't gonna fool me again. Hurt her, and you'll never find Renegade. I should do both of y'all right now. I should kill y'all for setting me up. She stays here. All right. But Renegade better be good. Otherwise, I'm gonna come back and have my way with Puerto Rico. You can't possibly walk outta here like this. She better not call the cops. Otherwise, I'm gonna send Jack the Ripper to cut her tongue out. Please don't go. I have to. I'm... Enough! Okay, I'm ready. Let's go. Let's go. Don't get no bright ideas. Otherwise, I'm gonna tear that pretty little head off your shoulders. Madison, don't do anything stupid! Hey, Madison. They left another of Lydia's packages in my apartment. Okay, just go give it to her, Philip. Oh, okay. Pretty good. I thought I was gonna have to knock him out. You're gonna get yours, and I hope I'm there to see it. Renegade wanna show you what he do to people who cross him. I'm gonna enjoy hearing you scream. I called the police. They're on their way! Where's Renegade? He better be here. Follow me. We gotta go around back. Renegade, where you at? You don't have to yell. Renegade? Come on. Screw you, old man. I'm here for my boy. This is Renegade's boy. He wanna know where he is. Look, give me Renegade. I'll take him, we'll be done. One more word, I'll send this blade through that mass of lard you call a brain. Go get Renegade, and we out. It's never that easy, okay? Easy is the new hard. Just take me to him, and we out. Dude, I have no beef with you. You will if Renegade aint out here in a minute. What is wrong with this dude? Don't worry, you'll be with him soon enough. You see, people like to think that weapons are the solution to their problem. Why don't you put that down? Let's settle this like men. Not bad for a old man. You're gonna get yours, and I pray I'm gonna witness it when it happens. Renegade wanna show you what he do to people who cross him. I'm gonna enjoy hearing you scream. Help me with him. Okay. Let's drop this off, literally. We're gonna need to lay low. House of Hope? - Let's go. - Okay, come on. Hurry up. That was close. That was nothing. That's gonna hurt tomorrow. Nothing that a little alcohol can't fix. Oh, come on, you got a comeback for everything. You know, I thought this was over. It never really is. He was gonna kill her. You did the right thing. He would've killed you both. Yeah. You know, I thought about the day that I'd come face to face with Renegade. Was it anything like you imagined? Hm-mm. Always the same vision. Ended with him in cuffs, in front of a judge. And being convicted. For squeezing the life outta my mother. Sometimes the best plans turn out for the better. I'm glad he's off the streets now, though. So he can't hurt nobody. But somehow, somehow it still hurts inside. It'll never stop in your mind. Have a bowl of my stew. You'll forget about all of your worries. Come on with that stew. I'll take a cup of tea any day over that stew. Again? Yes. You got no guts. Come on, I took you on. Yeah, you did. Now the world. You know what? I have to go check on Lydia. But you need to fix yourself up. I don't wanna see you next time and you look like, I don't know, fish food. Did you just see what happened? I'm gonna live my life, starting now. Live your life. The battle's over. Victory is yours. Yeah, as long as I live, I'm gonna fight the war in the streets one pimp at a time.
