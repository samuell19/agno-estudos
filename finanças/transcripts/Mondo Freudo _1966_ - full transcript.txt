(dramatic music) (wind roaring) - [Narrator] It is Saturday afternoon in Southern California. A lazy summer afternoon. And on this day some 25,000 people will come to this beach in search of fun and relaxation. Our cameraman has established a vantage point on a hill high above the beach. This is a 1,000 millimeter telescopic lens. Together with a Telebar attachment developed by Burns and Sawyer Cine Equipment Rentals on Hollywood. The unit is equal to a 1,700 millimeter lens. The lens is being mounted on a Arriflex Model 11B 35 millimeter motion picture camera. This camera and lens will provide you with the majority of the film you are about to see. It will give you a long, close up look at our society. This lens and this camera will be your eye to peer into Mondo Freudo, a Freudian world. A world of sex and sex symbols and the strange and unusual laws that govern it. (upbeat music) This film is sensitive to infrared light. It was developed by the United States Army during World War II for use in scouting bombing missions. An infrared spotlight similar to this one was attached to the belly of the plane. The light itself was not visible to the naked eye, since it works on the principal of heat rather than that of burning elements. The scout plane would fly in low in the cover of night and without being seen by enemy installations photograph potential target areas, therefore giving US bombers an advanced look at what lay ahead. It was our intention to photograph this same beach under the cloak of darkness. Our camera is now photographing the ocean. As we pan the infrared light into the scene, the waves become visible. However to someone standing on the beach looking at the ocean the spotlight would not be visible. (waves crashing) This couple was approximately one fourth of a mile from our camera position. (sensual music) We located this couple almost directly below the hill on which we were standing. Sex under the sun is not for the civilized. Only the night can release inhibitions and wash away the mask of modesty. (upbeat music) On the same night in Hollywood, a phenomenon was taking place. This is the Sunset Strip area. These 12 city blocks are crammed with no less than 14 teenage Watusi clubs and every Saturday night they are packed to capacity. A few blocks away we find the Losers club, now specializing in topless Watusi shows. The strip area attracts a wide variety of young people. Some are content to sit in the outdoor hot dog stands while the more aggressive ones fight their way to places such as this, It's Boss. The name of this particular club is a teenage expression in the United States meaning it's great. (upbeat music) This is Hollywood Boulevard, located about a mile and a half from the Sunset Strip. It is here that our teenage phenomenon takes place. Every Saturday night thousands upon thousands of automobiles filled with teenagers are here for only one purpose. To drive up and down Hollywood Boulevard. (upbeat music) The traffic problem is immense. The teenagers themselves are most friendly and upon seeing our camera most of them remarked "Smile, you're on Candid Camera!" The shops in this 26 block area used to remain open on Saturday night, now most of them are closed. Customers interested in buying no longer try to buck the traffic, they go elsewhere. The motion picture theaters on the Boulevard used to have their biggest grosses on Saturday nights. Now it is the worst night of the week. Same problem, it is all but impossible to get to the theaters unless you live close enough to walk. So why do they do it? Why do they drive aimlessly about, back and forth? When asked, they say "we like it, it's fun, "we get to see our friends, everybody's doing it". And for this and no other reason, they come here by the thousands. (sensual music) On this same Saturday night, we go to a burlesque club, teenagers are not allowed. In this sequence from the motion picture Hollywood's World of Flesh, we see an exotic dancer who works under the name Baby Bubbles. There are strict laws governing the dance this young lady is now performing. Her hands, for example, must never touch her body, but may only touch the garment that she is removing. She must finish her act wearing less but certainly nothing more than the usual g-string and pasties. (sensual music) This is London, England. In some ways laws governing sex in this country are more stringent than those in the United States. While in other ways, they are far more lenient. The basic problem seems to revolve around whether a particular show or act is being performed for the public, or for a private audience. In most cases performances for the public are controlled by censors who think sex should be on television, which has no censorship whatsoever. This is Downey's, one of the more fashionable clubs in London. It is a public club where the featured nude is required by law to keep 15% of her body covered with clothing. (sensual music) (audience applauding) This is Piccadilly Square and at midnight we visit the private club appropriately called The Cellar. Membership to this private club is open to all. Now you might say that makes it public, but not so, according to British law. You are stopped at the front door and advised that you may not enter since it is a private club. Before you can turn away, however, you are told membership would be one pound. Here, there is no orchestra, it costs too much. The music comes from a phonograph in the corner. There is no chorus line, no lavish costuming, just a spotlight and a girl wearing street clothes. The girl is not particularly beautiful, that is not one of the club's requirements. Nor could she in any way be considered a professional dancer. The Cellar has only one thing to offer, total nudity. There is no law for censorship in England governing private clubs. This girl will finish her act totally au naturale, sans pasties, sans g-string, sans everything. (sensual music) (audience applauding) The girls are paid what would amount to 10 American dollars for their evening's work. The shows in this particular club begin at midnight and continue until dawn. There are five girls who rotate throughout the evening with a half hour intermission between shows. (audience applauding) Prostitution in London is governed by a peculiar set of laws. In a side street just off Piccadilly Square we find a billboard for prostitutes. Since in London street walking is illegal, the girls solicit customers by placing their names and phone numbers on billboards such as this. Although they do not outwardly call themselves prostitutes or exhibitionists, reading between the lines easily tells each girl's specialty. We found ads for lesbians, masochists, sadists, and also good, straight, normal prostitutes of all sizes, shapes, and descriptions. We followed one of these ads and found two lesbians in a flat near the center of town. Their main occupation was performing sexual exhibitions and they were more than happy to discuss their lives in front of our cameras. - She's prettier than men. - [Narrator] Yes, well I think you're both lovely. - Well thank you. - [Narrator] Are you from London? - Well I'm from London, she's from the United States. - [Narrator] And how long have you been here? - Approximately four years. - [Narrator] May I ask why did you leave the United States? - Well I like the freedom here. People don't look down their noses at us. - [Narrator] Now, you are both lesbians? - Yes. - [Narrator] You have a very nice apartment here. May I ask how you manage to pay for it? - Well we've got a lot of nice friends and they lend us money. - [Narrator] Am I your friend? - You're all our friends. - [Narrator] How much do your friends usually leave you, I mean at one time? - Well it varies, sometimes as much as 20 pounds. - [Narrator] I see. What type of men generally are your friends? - Oh, all kinds. - [Narrator] If I were to loan you 20 pounds right now, what would that accomplish? - Well if you and your crew were to lend us 20 pounds, it might make us very happy and we'd invite you to stay here for a while and have a drink. And maybe we'd be so overcome with joy we might even make love to each other here on the couch. - [Narrator] I see. Okay, here's 60 pounds. - Well, you'll have to turn the camera off. - [Narrator] Why? - Well, if this is ever sold we'd be arrested for participating in exhibition. - [Narrator] I see. (men chattering) (sensual music) This is a restaurant in San Francisco, California. Home of the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco Giants, Knob Hill, the Cable Car, and the topless bikini fashion show. This is a businessman's club known as The Party. It starts serving lunch at 12 o'clock. Shortly thereafter the room is filled to capacity. No one really knows what the food is like, since no one really comes here to eat. These girls are models and not entertainers. And as such are not governed by the same laws as strip-tease artists. However, the show is so designed that by 1:30 in the afternoon, the end of the average junior executive lunch hour, these girls will be showing more nudity to their customers than the law allows on any burlesque stage. What then is the difference between a topless fashion show and a strip-tease artist? The courts define it thus, if a girl is modeling clothing that can be purchased in a clothing store, and if the clothing she is modeling happens to show some degree of nudity and said nudity is necessary in the display of said garment, said nudity is not objectionable. (men chattering) (men laughing) The customers in these establishments seem to take everything in stride. Most of them don't have any time to eat lunch, and if they do they usually wind up with acute indigestion. (men chattering) In Downtown Los Angeles we found another club devoted to Watusi music. It is called The Kabuki, and most of it's patrons are of oriental descent. (upbeat music) The ancestors of these oriental teenagers never did the Waltz. In fact, they never danced together at all. This was left to the Geisha girl whose dance was meant only for the entertainment and the delight of her paying customer. (upbeat music) (woman vocalizing) (upbeat music) The adult society of San Francisco, California has added a little spice to this new dance craze. They call it the Topless Watusi. This nightclub is located in San Francisco's North Beach District and the same laws governing nudity in topless fashion shows is applied here. Girls may dance and wait on tables wearing topless bikinis as long as it can be proven that the bathing suits can be purchased by the public. Were they not available in stores, these girls might be arrested for indecent exposure. Also, the girls are not considered performers and as such are not restricted by the laws of the burlesque stage. (upbeat music) This is Helman Thor, an artist with a most unusual and interesting theory on oil painting. It is his claim that the warmth of the body and the texture of the skin create a lifelike surface that breathes depth and being into a painting. This is a so-called beatnik nightclub on San Francisco's North Beach. It is owned jointly by Mr. Thor and another artist of equally questionable talent. Fortunately for Mr. Thor, he has never sold a canvas, for to do so would be illegal. (dramatic music) (playfully sensual music) And this is Mr. Thor's partner. A gentleman who clearly loves his work. Ever since his third grade teacher opened the door of excitement in finger painting, Joseph Morenzo had searched desperately for a way to make a living in that medium. His success seems apparent. His impressions sell for from $10 to $50. This in addition to the substantial revenue received as part owner of this club nets him an income that would be the envy of any living contemporary artist. (somber music) There are those who say that Mr. Morenzo is not an artist, but a recent court hearing proved them wrong. According to the San Francisco Supreme Court, what is not considered art today may tomorrow be a priceless possession. (audience applauding) The system Mr. Morenzo uses here was originally started in France, presumably by a frustrated artist who found that he was unable to properly proportion the human body on canvas. He started using his models to make an outline for the base of his work. The result of this outlandish art form sometimes resembles nothing better than a colorful Rorschach Test. (audience applauding) (upbeat music) Four miles south of San Diego we come to the Mexican border town of Tijuana. Offering Caliente, a lavish horse and dog racing track, a downtown bull fighting arena, offering some of the best matadors in the business, (speaking in foreign language), where one of the fastest games in the world is played and some of the fanciest abortion parlors to be found anywhere on the continent, to say nothing of it's lovely cathedrals. This is an Indian village just 14 blocks from the center of town. Their graveyard is located on a dusty hill which overlooks the village. (somber music) Our telescopic lens allowed us a closer look at the deplorable conditions under which these people live and die. This extreme poverty is located only five and one half miles from the richest nation in the world. Here the average family numbers eight. Living on a yearly income of about $500. There seems very little a man or a woman can do to raise their economic level. For Tijuana is a highly overpopulated community and for those who live in these villages, begging and prostitution is the major source of income. Street walking in Tijuana is not a lucrative business, and it does not have the sanction of the federal authorities. If a young girl is pretty enough and lucky enough, she may be sold into prostitution by her family. Through the use of our hidden camera, we shall show you one of the last slave trading operations in the world. (somber music) The girls you see here are being sold into slavery. This is not a sad occasion, for if the sale is made both girl and family will be better off. If sold, the girl's family will receive 50% of the sale price, the remainder going to the trader. If the girl is to be used as a prostitute, she can bring as high as $2,000. The better looking girls will be used in illegal nightclub acts and sex exhibitions. Whatever may happen to her now, her living conditions will have greatly improved. At worst she will be living in one of the city's 32 houses of prostitution, she will have a private room, and be fed regularly. And in return for this she must merely make love to anyone and everyone ushered to her bed. (light music) (indistinct chattering) (soft music) The majority of the nightclubs in this town offer the same type of entertainment. A few singers, a comic using 1940 material, and several tired strippers. (shouting) - [Man] Who says they wanna get me a (mumbles)? (audience applauding) (upbeat music) - [Narrator] But this club is different. It is one of the few clubs in town that supplies the customers with some of the sin that Tijuana has become so famous for. It operates as a front for a house of prostitution. Prostitutes openly solicit the customers on the club floor. They come and go as freely as they please. Our camera is hidden in a suitcase on one of the back tables in the club. (sensual music) (audience applauding) (announcer chattering) (sensual music) (men whistling) The shows don't vary too much from one to the other. As you have obviously concluded the girls are not professional dancers. Most of them, in fact, are prostitutes. Depending on the audience, she will ask one of the male members to join her on the stage. If he is shameless or drunk enough, he will cooperate and the two of them will perform a sex act for all to see. (audience applauding) (sensual music) (men chattering) (audience applauding) Quite a contrast from the dingy squalor of Tijuana, are the bright lights of Broadway in New York's Manhattan. We are traveling on Broadway toward Times Square. On the right, the Broadway theater presenting a legitimate musical play entitled Baker Street. And now Times Square can be seen in the distance. We are now in a loft in a Puerto Rican neighborhood 17 blocks off Times Square. (intense upbeat music) These people are witches, or at least so they claim. They have met here on this Thursday evening to perform a Black Mass. In order to be a member, you must first denounce God. Your principal aim from that moment on is to contact and pledge your allegiance to the devil. A religious cross has been painted black and placed upside down on a black altar. The circle in the center of the floor is where the devil's spirit shall appear. But before Satan will present himself, he must first be shown the sincere intentions of this group of witches. - [Woman] Those of us who believe in the power of Satan shall join hands. We believe in Satan and his power, that he will show himself to us on this night. Our power is the power of the devil. He is our motivation and strength. - [Narrator] Religious candles have been placed around the circle and the lighting of these candles indicates a presence of God. The blowing out of the holy candles by each member represents their denouncement of God. This young lady is the primary witch and her dance is meant to stimulate and to entertain the devil so that he might look more favorably on this sacrilegious group. (intense sensual music) (screaming) The blood of the chicken represents death, a subject that is most pleasing to Satan. Our witches must prove to the devil they do not fear death. In fact, they find it pleasing. And now the major part of the mass begins. The sacrifice of the virgin to the devil. This girl is 17 and her parents consider it an honor that she has been selected on this evening to give her body and soul to Satan. (intense drumming music) (screaming) The hog's head again represents death, and now that the sacrifice herself has seen death, she has become more physically attuned to the Black Mass. She is laid in the center of the devil's circle, giving Satan easy access to her body. - [Woman] We denounce God, we denounce God's church, and we denounce all that is holy. - [All] We denounce God, we denounce God's church, and we denounce all that is holy. - [Narrator] It is now presumed that each member of the mass is taken with the devil and the devil in fact has entered and is a part of each of their bodies. The drugs they have taken and the sound of the drum has pushed them to a pitch of emotional frenzy. They believe that their hands are the devil's hands, and that it is he and not they that are fondling her body. (speaking in foreign language) And now the sacrifice has felt death. Her mind and her body have now been fully prepared for Satan's assault on her virginity. - [Woman] Oh Satan, we offer you this virgin as a token of our esteem and we pray that you are pleased by our choice. We offer this girl to you as a symbol of our eternal devotion. She is now yours to do with as you will. - [Narrator] The final act of this mass could naturally not be shown for one of the main members representing the body of Satan will later, and in full view of all of the members, sexually assault this girl, fulfilling the last conceivable desire of the devil. Prostitution is illegal in New York, but like the mass, prostitution does exist. One just needs to know where to go. This is a side street on the Lower East Side. This scene was photographed on infrared film. Our camera was mounted in a packing case with a false two-way glass front. And a small transistorized microphone was taped under the door handle. - I got a great thing in mind, $10. - [Narrator] What goes for $10? - Well what do you want for $10? - [Narrator] Well I sort of dig (bleep). - (bleep), oh no honey, not for 10 bucks. Oh, by the way you pay the room. - [Narrator] I'll pay the room. How much for (bleep)? What have you got in mind that's different? I want somethin' special. - You like garter belts, baby? - [Narrator] Yeah. - Well why don't you come with me and I'll go put on a black garter belt and black hose and a black pair of heels and then we'll have some fun. - [Narrator] Let me have a better idea of what you mean. Specifically what do you got in mind? - Well after we get up there, you and I will fool around and (bleep) a little bit, and then you can (bleep). - [Narrator] How much would that cost? - Look I'll make it cheap, I'll make it $20. - $20? - Yeah. - [Narrator] You dig masochism at all? - Huh? - [Narrator] You dig getting beaten? - Well, I never tried that. - [Narrator] How much would you charge me for that? - Look baby, you got like... - [Narrator] How about your friend? - Yeah, yeah that's a good idea. - Hello. - Hi, baby. - [Narrator] What's your name? - Secret, what's yours? - [Narrator] Bob, Bob (bleep). - Nice to meet ya, honey. - [Narrator] I'd like to go up to your place and have a little action-- - Action? - [Narrator] But your friend and I can't seem to get along together. - What's the problem? - [Narrator] Well I'm looking for something unusual, something different. - Oh, like what? Like maybe like these? - [Narrator] Let me see that again, honey. - Next time you gotta pay for it, buddy. - [Narrator] Well I don't wanna buy unless I see and you turned away... - I'm sorry, you already got your free sample. How much do you want, huh? - [Narrator] Very nice. Aren't you afraid of police problems right out here on the street like that? - Huh? - Ah (bleep). - [Narrator] Why don't you get in the car with me and we can go up to your place. We'll talk money, come on. This is Sasabo in Japan. In this city, prostitution in any form is legal. As a matter of fact, there is very little in this country with regard to sex that is not legal. Abortions are available at nominal cost to all women who desire. Unlike Tijuana the street walkers are commonplace. Sex shops selling pornography, sexual stimulants, and lovemaking devices can be found in almost every Japanese city. Here at the sign of the peacock we find the Club Sasabo. It is a club dedicated to sadism and is somewhat similar to The Grand Guignol Theater in Paris, in that it appeals to the violent side of the human mind. (playfully sensual music) The show begins not too unlike a burlesque show in America. (audience applauding) (audience applauding) (intense music) (woman screaming) The cast is well paid for this performance, for there is no way for a beating to look realistic without being realistic. (woman groaning and moaning) (pipe thudding) (whip snapping) This is a restaurant in West Germany called The Old Heidelberg. And like the Sasabo in Japan, it presents an unusual form of entertainment. (crowd chattering) On this Friday night, The Old Heidelberg is holding it's weekly championship between Higa Schmidt and Kara Pansch. This is the world-famous mud fight that has titillated audiences for more than 12 years. The club itself is very small and only seats 150 people. There is an entrance charge which amounts to around two American dollars per person. As for the girls, well it requires no special talent to be a mud wrestler. A good figure is preferable, and a strong back is essential. (upbeat music) (crowd shouting and laughing) (audience applauding) (crowd whistling) (crowd cheering) Saturday morning in Southern California and the beaches are crowded as usual. In Germany two new girls are now stepping into the mud ring, while in London the nightclub stages are being readied for another evening. In Tijuana a new batch of girls is being purchased to fulfill the demands of the local brothels, while the head torturer at The Sasabo Club in Japan is busily oiling his whip for this evening's entertainment. Throughout the world people are preparing for a weekend of relaxation and entertainment. And tonight in Los Angeles, California thousands of teenagers will drive endlessly up and down Hollywood Boulevard searching for Mondo Freudo. (upbeat music)
