We are home, Miss Barrymore. Miss Barrymore. Oh. Thank you, Carter. Diana. What is it, Crista? Miss Strange, your mother. She knows about it. How? Magruder. That wrestler. She found it and gave it to her. Alright, Crista. Thank you for telling me. To review then, Mr Frank. It is clearly understood there will be no rewrites, changes or deletions .. Without Miss Strange's express permission in writing. Fine. One more thing. Miss Strange will correct only from galleys. Correct from galleys? Do you realize what that costs? We only do that for George Bernard Shaw. It was Mr Shaw himself who advised Miss Strange never to work in any other way. You should feel fortunate Mr Frank that your firm has been chosen .. To publish the life story of one of the most unique women of her day. I do, Miss Magruder. I assure you. I am always enthusiastic about starting work on a new book. It is only after chapter five or six that I have to go on a liquid diet. Anything else? - Yes. Miss Strange is a very busy woman. Her workday begins at nine and usually goes until midnight. She can be reached after that. So can I. But only by my wife. I see no need for humor, Mr Frank. Become an editor and you would. Don't worry, Miss Magruder. Miss Strange has talent and I respect it. We will be good friends. Goodbye, young lady. Goodbye. Goodbye, Mr Frank. Mother. Mother. - Diane, I am working. I must talk to you, mother. It is very important to me. So important you were willing to mail this without even telling me about it? I tried to tell you. Really I did, mother. But Magruder said you had too much work to do. Did you tell her what it was about? Did you tell her you were writing 'Dear Daddy'? 'I saw your photo in the papers and read you were sailing your boat to Florida'. 'Mother doesn't know, but I have seen all your movies'. 'And sometimes it is hard to believe you are really my father'. 'What I'd like to do is sit and talk to you like girls do with their fathers'. 'Could I, Daddy? Could I come and visit you aboard the Infanta?' Really, Diana. You're old enough to know .. Men don't have yachts to entertain their adolescent daughters. Certainly not Jack Barrymore. But he is my father. Why shouldn't he want to see me? Has he seen you in ten years? Has he even asked about you since our divorce? And yet you go on devouring all that trash about him in the newspapers. As if he were a knight in shining armor. I want to know about him. That is why I read all those stories. If you must know about him, then know the truth. He's been drinking more than ever. His escapades are ruining his career. He couldn't even finish his last picture. That's why he's aboard the boat. To try to get a grip on himself. I won't impose myself, mother. I just want to write and ask. He won't answer you. If he doesn't .. I won't ever mention him again. I promise. Alright, Diana. Mail your letter. Find out for yourself how much interest Jack Barrymore has in his daughter. What will I do, daddy? What will I do? Baby, take it easy. He's seen it. Now let him get a great big swallow on that hook. And when I say 'now' .. Give the pole a good jerk. Now. That's it. I can't hold it. - Hang on. You're doing fine. Look out. It's alright, honey. Don't worry. Nothing happened. I am sorry. That is nothing to be sorry about. I'd just as soon have a steak for dinner anyway. Thanks. Here. Well. We'd better call it a day, Crowley. You see, the fish have to win sometimes. Otherwise they get suspicious. You mean, you are really not angry at all? Say. Who's been stepping all over you? Oh. Don't tell me. I know. Look. We've got a whole week together. Let's not think about her. There is a lot of backtracking to do. All I want to know about is you. Do you? Are you really interested? Avidly. Then I'll start at the beginning and I won't leave out a single word. I guess I was about the most boarded-out girl in New York. After Stimsons there was Barstow and then St Mary's. But mother said it carried progressive education just a little bit too far .. When I couldn't read or write at nine. But you and mother were the only people I wanted to write to. And you were both always in some part of the world mail couldn't get to. It got so if anyone said 'mother', all I thought of was a drawer of postcards. The only reasons I liked school at all was because of you. When the girls found out that John Barrymore was my father .. They asked the craziest questions. Like: did the actors really kiss the actresses and did they kiss back? Or did they just press their lips together and hold their breath. It mostly depends on whether they were kissing Jean Harlow or Rin-Tin-Tin. I've had the distinction of being bitten by both of them. I'll bet. Even Doris Settabare from Peru and Helen Singh from Bombay knew all about you. You are world famous. Did you know that, daddy? Really. They couldn't believe I was your daughter. You looked so young. On the screen, that is. Isn't that funny, daddy? Hilarious. You know, I used to dream of spending a week with you like this. I never thought it would happen. Mother letting us enjoy ourselves this way. You can't imagine how I felt when she said I could come. Diana. [ Ship's horn. Loud ] Infanta, ahoy! Is that you, Jack? Who's there? Who is there? Henning, you whelping lover. Bill Henning. Bill. I thought you were meant to be in Spain writing a book on the war or something. I was. I came back for a new typewriter ribbon. I've been Looking for you for two days. What for? Well, I've got all your old friends aboard. When they heard you were nearby everybody wanted to see you, Jack. And have a good cry. Well, who is everybody? Jack, darling. This is Lynn. How are you? Lynn? Oh, Lynn. I am older. Very much older. Jack. Are you rich? No. But my wives are. 'Never was a monarch better feared or loved than your majesty'. Remember, Jack? 'Alas'. 'You are too much love and care for me'. 'Are heavy orisons against this poor wretch'. 'The nimble gunner now the devilish cannon touches'. You haven't forgotten that, have you? 'Once more into the breach'. 'Dear friends, once more'. 'Or close the wall up with our English dead'. 'In peace'. 'There is nothing so becomes a man ..' 'As modest stillness and humility'. 'But when the blast of war blows in our ears'. 'Then imitate the actions of the tiger'. 'Stiffen the sinews'. 'Summon the blood'. 'Disguise fair nature with ill-favoured rage'. 'Be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war'. 'Let us swear'. 'That you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not'. 'For there's none of you so mean or base who hath not noble lustre in your eyes'. 'Follow your spirits'. 'And upon this charge ..' 'Cry .. God for Harry .. England ..' 'And St George'. Dad. Are you alright? Of course. Come on in. The water is fine. Hang on to this, Mr Barrymore. We'll have you out in a minute. Alas, poor Yorick. Jack, you fool. That was magnificent. But what do you do for an encore? Did you like it? I'm booked for the Aquacade next summer. Listen, you idiot. You're too much fun to be left to sit brooding by yourself on that old tub. Why don't you come with us? Where to? Rio. They are holding the Mardi Gras up until we get there. Come on, Jack. We'll need someone to fill out the tail end of the dragon. I'm your man. Baby. It's been a wonderful week. Stay aboard as long as you want. Crowley will take you anywhere you want to go. And you tell Michael to lay off my half of you. Or we'll all come back and breathe fire on her. Jack. You mad man. It won't do any good. Whatever he is looking for he won't find in Rio either. I bored him. All the time I was talking I knew it but .. I just couldn't stop. I had so much I wanted to tell him. Don't feel bad, Miss. He was just lonely for his kind of people again. He didn't mean to hurt your feelings. My feelings aren't hurt. I am just jealous. I am jealous of every one of them. That was wonderful, Eddie. All the music was. All night long. Thanks, Diana. The best party of the season. Everybody was real loose. See you tomorrow night. A big shindig. - I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? We've had that date for three months. I've had parties for a while, Linc. All this was mother's idea. And now that it is over I'd like to feel I have paid my debt to society. I am hungry. I've been so busy coming out I haven't had a chance to put anything in. Did you know my mother was my father's secretary before they were married? If that's a family skeleton, I am not impressed. No. Nothing like that. I was just thinking how wonderful it was for him. All the things he could show her she'd never seen. All the things he could give her she'd never had. Have some of this. - Thanks. You know, ma hadn't been out of Staten Island .. When they went to France on their honeymoon. Dad told me he'd never forget the look on her face that first morning .. When she stopped out on a balcony overlooking all of Paris. He said it was the first time in his life he was grateful for being rich. You wish I were poor, Linc. Is that what you are trying to say? So you could win me by giving me everything. Hmm. That is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. I almost wish I hadn't already been to Paris eight times. The rich have nothing to offer the rich, have they. What I want, you cannot buy with money. Have you tried? It's a world. A whole special world. Exciting people who write and paint. And act and don't care about anything. Well, at least you've learned that much. What? That they don't care about anything else. You are a grown girl now, Diana. Don't you think it is about time you stopped chasing your father .. And started living your own life? Yes. You would think so, wouldn't you. Got any ideas about how you are going to get into this special world? The only way I know how. I am going to try to be an actress. I know I seem the sternest judge of all. The harshest opposition. Two minutes. It is my lot to call you most severely to task. Wish me luck, mother. It isn't every day a girl has her opening night on Broadway. You won't need any luck, Diana. You've worked long and hard for this. Harder than on anything I've ever wanted you to do. Just the same. A little luck never hurts. Knock 'em dead, Di. Faithful, noble Linc. Honey. We got their money. The law says we got to give them a show. Come on. I must insist on you reading all these documents. They form a part of the plot in which you are now involved. You will find no mention of state debts in them. The letters are an attempt to drag me into a prolonged intrigue. Which was necessary for the full effect of his blackmailing. A conspiracy from the beginning to end. Alexander. Alexander. [ Loud audience applause ] Whatever it is, she has sure got it. Listen to that applause. Don't be a boy, Linc. They are not applauding her. They are applauding her name. Now wait a minute. - You needn't look at me like that. You watched her stumble through rehearsals. You know as well as I how good she's ever going to be. So, she will get it out of her system. Maybe then she will marry me and forget about acting. They will never let her. The name of Barrymore is a commodity in this business. There's no producer in the country who won't jump at a chance to cash in on it. By tomorrow morning she will have a dozen offers. A dozen chances to make an even bigger fool of herself. And there is nothing I can say that will make you change your mind? I can't understand why you would want to. I am an actress now and this is a wonderful opportunity. Diana, you've had so little experience. I know that. I told the studio people that. But .. Movies don't require the same experience as the stage. With cameras you get a chance to do things over and get them right. You can't stop me, mother. You can only delay me for four months until I am twenty-one. Then I don't need your consent. Alright. I will sign it. But there is something I want you to sign first. What is it? It's a promise. A solemn promise you won't stay with your father while you are in California. You really hate him, don't you? No. I don't hate him at all. I only hate what he's done to himself. If you had known him as I once did. A face like a renaissance prince. A body bursting with talent and vitality. You would hate what he has become. But you could never hate him. I won't promise not see him at all. If he wants to see me. I didn't ask you to. Bring her over here, Doug. Miss Barrymore, how does it feel to have the lead in a new epic? I am happy. Happy and glad as any girl would be. Are you nervous? Do you miss New York? What do you think of Hollywood? - Fine. Fine so far. Am I in it? So far, love it. - Right up here, Miss Barrymore. That was fine. Have you any comment on Cora Steele's item? What was that? I didn't see it. I've got it right here. Miss Barrymore, would you cross your legs please. Yes, of course. - Thank you very much. Now, how about a little of that Barrymore genius, huh? Are you going to stay with your father while you are out here? No. We haven't seen each other in years. I will .. I will be at a hotel. Miss Barrymore. Cora Steele writes as follows: I quote. 'We all hope Diana Barrymore will not follow in her father's footsteps'. 'For, in only four short years he's managed to turn himself ..' 'From Hollywood's most sought-after actor into its most unreliable drunk'. 'To my knowledge, Jack hasn't been vertical for the last six months'. Unquote. That is a lie. Obviously, the cadaverous Miss Steele .. Is jealous of the fact that I'm vertical far more often than she is horizontal. Hey, it's her old man. Hey, how about a picture of you two together? Can we quote you on Cora Steele? B .. a .. double r .. y. M .. o .. r .. e. Hello Diana. You have grown into a lovely woman since I swam out of your life. How about kissing her, Mr Barrymore? How about a picture of you two kissing, huh? In the words of the press: how about it? If you don't want to .. I'll understand. Please. Please do. Fantastic. Of course, some chintz in the windows might make an enormous difference. Is this where you sleep? Hmm. When I sleep. This is the only room in the house that has any furniture. Where is everything? Ah, that is a question I have often asked myself. But the answer is really quite simple. I'm a man who likes beautiful things. Unfortunately, so do my creditors. Are you broke, dad? Flat. But don't let it trouble you. I might have lost a battle. But not the war. Maybe it's none of my business but .. Couldn't you sell this place and move in to something a little more comfortable? I would love to, my dear. Do you happen to know somebody who would like to buy Grand Central station? Gerhardt. You have done it again. Ninety-nine parts water, one party elderberry wine. I can at least hope Gerhardt .. That you've laid in something a little more comforting for our guest. I'd rather not have anything. Thank you. Have you, Gerhardt? Mr Barrymore, you know I cannot keep anything else in the house. Please, dad. I really don't want anything. Why not, Diana? Nobody has proved it's hereditary. They have however proved that some things are. That frown for instance. You just shot me. That is your uncle Lionel to a T. You know, Diana. I rather resent him getting into the act this way. But then, he always did. Richard the Third? Ah, yes. You wouldn't think he would be much use anymore, would you? But he is. He is a penny bank. When this old codger goes. He will leave me a rich man. Come on. There is more to see. [ Bird squawking ] What is that? That .. is Uncle Sam. The Bureau of Internal Revenue gave him to me. As a consolation prize. He doesn't look very consoling. Oh, he is. Sam and I understand each other. We are two old men who have flown pretty high .. And ended up caged. He looks lonely in there. Well, if he does it's his own fault. You know, this cage used to be filled with birds from all over the world. And your creditors loved them too. Not exactly. But when I couldn't afford to pay the feed bills any longer .. Then Sam just decided to take matters into his own .. Claws. Where are we going now? - To show you something. Something very special. Why, it is beautiful. Do you like it, baby? It is for you. Brand new .. and paid for. Of course I like it. It's one of the prettiest rooms I've ever seen. I am so glad. All the time I was talking nonsense downstairs .. I was worried sick you might think it a bit .. Old-fashioned. It is lovely. Just lovely. But I just can't. I suppose your mother has been briefing you about past history. She said how I was drunk and disorderly and disgraced her over two continents? It is all true, you know. Every word of it. But she was telling you about her husband. And we're talking about your father. A man who has given up the search for the fountain of youth and .. Only wants and loves his daughter. You know something? It just occurred to me. I have done nothing but talk since we got here. That is right. You are not going to swim away, are you? Uhuh. Gerhardt. Yes, Mr Barrymore? Kindly bring up my daughter's things, will you? Certainly. Was he there all the time? He is always here. Who is he? Gerhardt? He is my .. My keeper. Well, now you're making a movie .. I suppose the time has come for a little fatherly advice. The first .. Ah, here he comes now. With a breakfast fit for a king. Shouldn't you have some toast or coffee or something? Yes. Yes, I suppose I should. I was hoping you wouldn't mention it. It is hard enough as it is to get down this watered vermouth. However. To refer to acting. The most important thing for an actress is to have confidence. For instance, if you're in front of an audience who laugh in the wrong places. You need poise enough not to feel behind you to feel if your flap is up or down. Apart from that, it's just like a lot of little boys playing cowboys and Indians. You know that isn't true. Not for you. Her ears are too big. I am a hair stylist, Mr Snow. Not a plastic surgeon. So, am I asking you to operate? That's hair on her head, isn't it? Cover them up. Don't worry about your ear problem, Diana. Leonard is an expert with ears. He is a real ear specialist. Aren't you, Leonard? Yes, Mr Snow. I never thought I had a problem, Charlie. We'll lick it. When the producer says 'cover them up', cover it up they get. If I were you I'd sue them for slander. Those are as fine a pair of ears as I have seen. If I had anything between them I'd get out of here and forget the whole thing. I wouldn't feel too badly. Look what they have done to me. I play a gambler. They thought I wasn't hawk-like enough. You are new here, aren't you? Uhuh. So am I. Fresh out of New York. Vince Bryant is my name. What is yours? Diana. Diana Barrymore. Of course. I have heard all about you. You're the Cinderella girl who came all equipped with her own golden coach. Just what do you mean by that? I mean all my life .. I've been genuinely, honestly impressed with your family. And now I am genuinely, honestly impressed with you. That is such a lie. The only one to be genuinely, honestly impressed with me now is a sheepdog. I've heard all about you too, Mr Bryant. Three hit shows in a row. The fattest part in Sunset over New Orleans. The word is that .. You can look forward to living out your days in Hollywood. Well, the next twelve weeks anyway. Look .. as long as we are both going to be living out our days here. How about living some of them together? Huh? - Well. What I mean is, we are both really tourists from New York. How about just admitting it and going round gawking at the sights with me? We could do it at night after work. I think I would like that. I've always wanted to see if my feet were smaller than Clara Bow's. Can you come in for a while? - I had better not, Diana. I got a six o'clock call. The whole cast goes to Frisco in the morning. Vince, I've had a wonderful time. Not only tonight but every night. Since you first noticed my ears three weeks ago. Someday those ears will be enshrined in cement at the Chinese. Take it from Vince Bryant who has an eye for an ear. Or is it an eye for an eye? Well, anyway. You know. Actors should never write their own love scenes. I loused that one up something awful. I thought it was nice. Did you? Write to me. Is that the actor's death sentence? Don't call us, we'll call you. What does it mean? - It means write to me. Write often. Dad. Dad. Dad. Is that you? Please. Go away, Diana. Leave me alone. Are you alright? Is there anything I can do? - Yes. There is. Get out of my sight. Leave me alone. It's alright, Miss Barrymore. I'll take over now. Okay. We've had our little joke. How about getting back to bed now, Mr Barrymore. Don't you come near me. My god. I'm warning you! I think he had better get to bed, Miss Barrymore. Please, dad. Put it down. I'll put it down. I'll put it down his throat. It is best if you go. He's a proud man and he knows everything that's going on. It will kill him if you stay and watch what has to happen now. Alright. She has gone now, Jack. Why not put the bottle down so I don't have to take it away from you. Don't you call me 'Jack'. You muscle-bound ape. I pay your salary and don't you forget it. Mr Barrymore, that is certainly right. And now I am going to have to earn it. Let me go! Diana. Diana! Let me go. Diana. He's killing me, I tell you. He is killing me. He is killing me! Miss Barrymore. How is he? Is he alright? He would like to see you. - Of course. He's a sick man, Miss Barrymore. One or two more times like this and it will be all over for him. How did it happen? His medicine was gone. It seemed funny but when he dozed off I thought I'd run out to get some more. I should have known it was just another of his cute tricks. Where did he get the brandy? I wish I knew. People say he's a genius and they're right. When it comes to hiding bottles he could drive the whole FBI nuts. [ Bird squawking ] You got him back. He just took a piece of meat. It's happened before. Every time he gets drunk. Well. I'll leave you alone with him. Alright. Thanks. That was a hell of an entrance for a scene like this. If we were on the stage I would strangle you. I am sorry, baby. It's alright. It's over. I am so glad you are not a hypocrite. I won't forget it, if that's what you mean. You are too important to me. By tomorrow we could be laughing and pretending it never happened. But that isn't what I want. Sometimes it's a good thing to pretend that some things .. Don't exist. Not for me. Too many things never existed for me. Like a .. A mother and father? Yes. I am sorry, baby. Sorry you had to wait this long for me. Until I am old. And I'm drunk. And can't give you anything. I only wanted you to know how important it is to me. That you have tried to stop. Does it really mean that much to you? Do I mean that much? Yes. You always have. Alright, baby. But it won't make up for that rocking-horse I should have given you. But for as long as I can, I'll try. I'll try to give you a whole and sober father. Everybody. Everybody. Your attention please. George. Kill the house lights. Hey, Charlie. Take the cigar out of your mouth. Nobody can understand a word you are saying. You guys. If I do that, how's anybody going to know I am a producer, huh? Alright. This is the big moment. I've just seen a rough-cut of our new picture. Forever In My Heart. And there's no doubt in my mind. That we are in at the birth of a new star. To prove how much faith .. Imperial Pictures has in their judgement .. I am going to give all of you a preview. Of the publicity build-up she is going to get. Freddy, please. You've loved Lionel Barrymore. You've thrilled to John Barrymore. And now. Exalt. To Diana Barrymore. In .. Forever In My Heart. What is the name again, Charlie? Aren't you afraid the Smith Brothers are going to sue you for stealing their act? You guys. It's alright, Charlie. Nothing to worry about. The Barrymores and the Smiths have a treaty. We don't make cough-drops and they don't make .. Well, never mind what they don't make. You all look so young I'm afraid I will have to introduce myself. I am the one you all .. Thrill to. You make the greatest entrances. Jack. Jack, I'm so glad you could make it. Can I get you something? I mean like a Coke or an orangeade or something? Well, thank you Charlie. An excellent idea. George, hit the house lights, will you. Pardon me. - Hello Jack. Long-time no see. Hello, Bill. That's right. What will it be, Jack? Or doesn't it matter as long it is wet? There is everything, Jack. Ginger ale, lemonade, cream soda. Root beer. Champagne. A bottle of champagne. - Certainly, sir. I'll take that, sport. Thank you. Charlie. - Yes, Jack? Does the front office share your enthusiasm for this picture? Sure, Jack. Why? This champagne they sent down. - What about it? It is domestic. But in those old days Hollywood was the most exciting place in the world. Overnight .. Telephone operators, cowpokes .. And glove salesmen became millionaires. The idols of the country. Every one of us was like .. Well, like a kid in a candy store. We built palaces on hilltops. Bought custom-made cars. Every man got his mother that chauffeur he'd promised her when he was a kid. You know. Do you miss it, Jack? Miss it? Well, sometimes. But the best fun I ever had in my life was in a little house in White Plains. I used to cut the grass myself. I had the smoothest, evenest lawn .. In all the east. That was when you were married to Michael? Yes. Yes. Diana was only about knee-high then. She used to sit on her mother's lap out in the sun .. And both of them would laugh their heads off. Watching me wrestle that lawnmower. I used to cut her grass whistles to try to impress her. Did you know that, Di? What happened then? What happened then? Something I never thought of. The grass kept growing. No matter how many times I cut it, it just kept growing. It was like .. it was like the thousandth night of a hit play. You know. When you feel if you must say the same words once more over again .. You'll go stark raving mad. So, to break the monotony. I took a drink. Then I took another. One day I woke up in Copenhagen. Mr Barrymore, you asked me to tell you when it was ten. Oh yes. Thank you, Gerhardt. You can't go now. The party is just beginning. Don't go, Jack. I never saw this bunch of ink-slingers stay so quiet in all my life. Thanks a lot, fellows. But there's been an awful lot of .. Grass in my life and it's taken its toll. I'll go with you. Don't get up. No, darling. Why don't you stay? Look. I was speaking so much you had no chance to tell the boys about your picture. Go ahead if you want to, Diana. And don't you worry about us. We are all going to be on your side in the morning edition. Thank you. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight, boys. - Goodnight, Jack. Copenhagen. Excuse me a minute, will you? Sure, Charlie. Jack. Jack, I don't know how to thank you. You had all of them eating out of your hand. And no kidding, Jack. They would have murdered us without you. Thanks, Charlie. I had a good time. Listen, Jack. While you were talking I had an idea. The studio just bought The Man Who Came to Dinner. You'd be perfect for Sheridan Whiteside. I am not producing it but if you like I can put in a good word for you upstairs. I'll talk to Squires myself. - That would be wonderful. Thanks a lot, Charlie. But .. Why don't you wait for the cold, grey dawn .. Before making any rash promises? - I don't have to. I'm not one of those hot-and-cold guys. I watched you. You didn't open that champagne bottle all night. Anybody with that much willpower, I am not afraid to go bat for. I don't know how you did it, Jack. It really wasn't hard, Charlie. Wasn't hard? I don't get you. Charlie. I hate champagne. Come on. Mr Barrymore. Huh? If you don't mind I think I'll go to a movie. Do you mean you are letting me out on parole? Well, let's just say I am making you a trusty. Temporarily. For good behaviour. I feel like a very small boy. Whose mother has just dropped him off at school for the first time. Come on inside, you big ham. Speaking of ham. Sheridan Whiteside is the part I think I could really get my teeth into. Think Charlie was serious? Well, of course he was. - Well, you know Charlie. I miss that bar. Yes., I do know, Charlie. He'll be so anxious to take credit for your comeback .. That he will forget to be scared about sticking his neck out. I hope you are right. - I know I am. I'll bet anything that tomorrow morning Mr Squires will phone you first thing. Squires? He hasn't called me in five years. - Well. Now it's five years and one month. Yes. Things have begun to straighten out a bit, haven't they. Yes. They have. I owe you a lot, Diana. Well, you just see that you are properly grateful. I had better get some sleep. I have to look good in the morning. Publicity stills. Oh. Goodnight, Diana. - Goodnight. Diana. Yes? I think I'd be good as Whiteside. I really do. Do you think there is anyone in the world would ever doubt it? It has been five years, you know. Now don't be silly. Go to bed. Alright. Goodnight, darling. Diana. Yes? Don't laugh. I'm going to call Michael. Michael? Yes. I am going to ask her to come out here for a while. That really was the best time of your life. Wasn't it? With her. Oh yes. Michael had .. She had substance. All the rest was just like images on a screen. Even in life. What do you think? If you really want to I think you should. I'll go to bed. Don't go. I'd sooner you stayed. "Long distance." I'd like to put in a person-to-person call if you please to New York. Miss Michael Strange. Rhinelander 4-7-0-9-8. "I'll call you as soon as I have your party on the line." No, no. I'll hang on, operator. "Very well, sir." "New York?" "New York." "This is Los Angeles calling Rhinelander 47098." "Thank you, operator." "The Strange residence." "This is Los Angeles calling Miss Michael Strange." "I am sorry. Miss Strange is out." "Sir, your party is out. Shall I try again later?" Yes, operator. Thank you. Please do. "Thank you, sir." Well. That. Was an anti-climax if ever I heard one. Shouldn't you go to bed? She may not be back for hours. It is after midnight in New York. She ought to be back any minute. She will still be there tomorrow. I was never much of a man for tomorrows. I can already feel the courage oozing out of me. It's now or never. I'll make some coffee. Thank you. Aha. Now that is what I call a loving daughter. At least I won't have to plead my case on an empty stomach. Did they call back? - No. Not yet. Any minute now. You know, Michael never liked to stay out much after one. [ Telephone ] Ah, you see? I know that girl. Hello. "I have your party now, sir." Good. Put her on. Hello? Michael. Oh, Michael. How are you? Jack. Is that you? Yes, big darling. It is. "It really is." It is very late, Jack. I know. I tried to get you earlier. Well. I had been to the theater. Desmond opened tonight in Justice. A New York opening night. I can see you now. You must be in jewels and furs and dressed in black. But you were always far more interesting than anything happening on the stage. What do you want? To talk to you, Michael. To remember. Tell me. Do you ever wear it anymore? "Do you ever try to recapture the past like I do?" What do you want, Jack? I want the impossible. For the years between to drop away and things to be as they once were with us. Jack. Are you .. Alright? Of course I am, darling. Never better. And Fig, do you know who has done it? Now don't be angry. Diana is here. She has been a saint. She has straightened me out like nobody else could. Except you. Jack, I can't start .. Fig, darling. Listen to me. I want you to come out here. There can be wonderful years ahead of us if you want it. Didn't I tell you? They want me to come back to work. They want me to play Sheridan Whiteside in The Man Who Came To Dinner. Of course, I shall be nothing but sensational. Ha. That is wonderful, Jack. I am happy for you. Are you happy with me? I'll be on top again and you can write your books. And lecture those idiotic club women on the evils of .. Diaper rash. "Or any other damned fool thing you want if you'll just say yes." "Actors make comebacks." "Why not marriages?" Please, Fig. It means so much to me. Fig. Fig. She hung up. She hung up! You were drunk. She knew it. She's still so important to you that you can't face the idea of not having her? You are still a child. You would not understand these things. I'm glad she isn't coming. Glad? What do you mean? If this is what she does to you I don't want her here. You don't want her here? You haven't been drinking at all. We have been happy. I hated it when you said you were going to call her. I knew it would end up with you throwing it all away. You hated what? You hated what? I'll tell you what you hated. You hated the whole idea of me and Michael getting together again. Because you are afraid if we did, you would be on the outside. Is that so hard for you to understand? Hard? It is incredible. You little idiot. What do you think you are doing? Stick me in that cage over there? With a pipe and slippers so that daddy wouldn't get away from you again. You've no right to talk to me like that. A little while ago you said you owed a whole new life to me. Yes. Most women I've known waited a little longer before they tried to collect. Diana. I am your father. And no matter what I said to you, I love you. Your mother and I gave you .. Such a dirty deal when you were small. I know that. We gave you so little love and .. And affection. But now you seem to feel you want to hoard it. Like a miser with his gold. Love doesn't work that way. The moment you try to force it, it .. It dries up and blows away as if it never existed. Let go of me. [ Bird squawking ] Baby. I am fifty-nine years old. And I am not as drunk as you think. Won't you .. Take what little I have to offer and .. Not make me jump through hoops. Care to fill out a preview card, sir? Here you are. Well, if you ask me I can tell you exactly where the trouble was. I didn't ask you, Martha. Every picture you make you have to cast Mortimer Green in a sympathetic part. Like it was a law. So what if he grew up in the same pool room with you? Does that make him sympathetic? - My wife. I don't have trouble enough? Look, Charlie. No use pushing the panic button. Alright, so we're a little long. We cut it. Brilliant. Brilliant. Which part do we cut? The part where they didn't laugh at the jokes but did laugh at the death scene? Do you really think we're in that much trouble, Charlie? What I think doesn't matter. From here on, it is in the lap of the gods. I tell you, Charlie. There never was a picture that can't be helped by cutting. Yeah. Sure, sure. Excuse me, Mr Snow. Here is the first batch. Well. Fasten your seatbelts. Well, Charlie? It's a bomb. A disaster. Wait a minute, Charlie. That's only the first twenty cards. Twenty. Or twenty thousand. The answer is going to be the same. What about me? Did I ..? Did I help or hurt? The truth? I won't even read you what they say. Now look. They're not always right. I've seen it happen lots of times. But only in pictures. I think I'd better leave here before somebody asks me for their money back. Goodnight. Miss Barrymore. Miss Barrymore. Gerhardt. What is it? What are you doing here? I just took him to the hospital. It is bad this time. He's been drinking for a month. Ever since you left. No matter what I did I couldn't stop him. Why didn't you call me? You knew I would have come. He wouldn't let me. You know how he is. He said if you came back it had to be on your own. He doesn't even know I am here now. Where is he? Lakeside. I'd take you only I got to back for his pyjamas. He says he wouldn't be caught dead in one of those hospital nightgowns. I'll be there in about an hour. Okay, Charlie. Let's go. Tonight we're fixing. Just a minute. Diana. Diana. Wake up. It's me. Vince. Come on. Vince. I'm glad to see you. I heard about it on the radio. I got here as fast as I could. I knew how much he meant to you. He meant so much to me. I have killed him. You can't blame yourself for what happened. He was a sick man. You knew that. Oh yes. I knew that. So I walked out on him and let him drink himself to death. Nobody could stop him. A hundred people have tried. I could. I did. For a whole month. Then we fought. He said I asked too much of him. I try to .. Make people love me. I could have told him that wasn't true. Vince, do you love me? I know I missed you terribly all the time I was gone. In a little while .. - Kiss me, Vince. Please kiss me. I plan to. After I've got some hot coffee into you. I think you'll appreciate that even more. No. Kiss me now. Diana. - Now. I guess it must be true. I'm leaving for New Orleans again tomorrow morning. I suppose they figure if one riverboat picture is good, two is better. "Right. Do you mind telling Diane we're planning to do her retakes next week?" Okay. I will tell her. Who are you talking to? Charlie Snow. Your retakes start next week. "Stop by the office before you leave." Listen. Take good care of my girl and I'll see you in about three months. Okay, Charlie. Goodbye. Where is he going? He isn't. I am. The script has been cleared and the studio wants me to leave tomorrow. Oh. And, are you? Now, that's a silly question. I signed a paper, remember? Promising to love, honor and obey .. Imperial Pictures forty weeks out of every fifty-two. You signed one with me for life. Hey. You sound more like a warden than a wife. That is funny. What? My father said almost the same thing. Will you cut it out? I don't know what has gotten into you. If we were going out, you wouldn't even have brandy pears. I hate pears. Now come on. Come and see what I got you. Is there anything left? You've already given me a solid gold watch, cuff links, rings .. A belt buckle, tie clasp, cigarette case, lighter. It's gotten so I'm afraid to go down the street alone. Diana, isn't this getting a little silly? I love you. Is that so silly? Let's see how this goes with your eyes. It's bound to go with either the red, the white or the blue. Shut up. Or tomorrow I will bring home a gold flagpole. Vince. Don't go. Please. Diana. I have to. I'm an actor. And thank goodness, a working one. You should feel happy instead of trying to make me feel like a heel. We don't need the money. There will be other parts. Pictures that will let us stay together. In the first place you don't have that much money. You only spend it as though you did. And even if you did .. I'm just not the kind of guy that would let himself live off a nickel of it. Vince, I cannot be alone anymore. I have been alone too long in my life. I need someone now. All the time. And I need to work. Diana, you've just got to grow up. Alright. Maybe I will. While you are gone. Maybe I will. Diana, baby. Sensational broad. Where you been all my life? You mean, where has my turkey been, huh? Everybody have enough? We are almost out of ham. Oh. Coming right up. The bourbon is getting low, Mrs Bryant. I don't know where they are putting it. Better call the liquor store. Is there more ham in the kitchen, Mary? - Yes, Mrs Bryant. Hey. Who is the wet one? Forget it, Johnny. She is married. Her husband is on location. Then she's in trouble. Take this, Ken. Where are you going? To dry her off. Hi. I'm Johnny Howard. I play tennis. Were you .. planning to play in here? Were you planning to swim in here? Uhuh. I was just filling the pool. That's very funny. I bet you keep your husband in stitches. My husband isn't here. You knew that, didn't you? Hmm. If he was he wouldn't let you walk about with all those goosebumps on your back. No sale. Alright. I can't let you walk around like that. Here. The sweater is free. Take it before you turn blue. Are you scared of me? Or you? That's much better. Thank you. Now I'd better go up and change. You know, your muscles are all tightened up. That's what comes of being wet so long. Your muscles get like knots. Doesn't that feel good? It feels very public. Relax. It's free. Just like the sweater. I can just hear your muscles saying thank you. Why don't you just say 'you're welcome' and .. Let me up? I have got to get back to my guests. If I were you .. The only thing I would want to get to right now is a nice hot shower. Diana. Charlie. Can I speak to you a minute? It's important. Why, sure. Pour yourself a drink. I am having my muscles untied. No thanks. I mean alone. Alright. But .. That may be a bigger problem than you think. Thank you, mister ..? - Howard. John Howard. Thank you, Mr Howard. You won't be leaving just yet, will you? Uhuh. You got my sweater. So I have, haven't I. Come on, Charlie. I have been expecting you. This is as good a place as any. Sit down. How long has this been going on? Just since noon. Charlie, I can save you a lot of time. I am not going back. You can't say that to me, Diana. You just can't say it. I've got a million, two-hundred-thousand dollar picture sitting on a shelf. The front office won't release it as it is and I don't blame them. We have to do those retakes. Can't you just pretend I am dead? - But you're not dead. Movies are a business, not poetry. I've had 85 men on full salary waiting for you for three weeks now. What's happened to you, Diane? That is a long, long story. Let's just say I .. Lost my incentive. Yeah. But if you don't come back I'm going to lose a lot more than that. I will be out, Diana. And so will you. If you don't show up tomorrow you will never work in pictures again. You were at the preview, Charlie. The audience already decided that. They just didn't .. exalt to me. And that is your final answer? Yes. It is. As final as I get these days. Alright. I'll give my wife and the three boys your regards. I am sorry, Charlie. But .. go away. Please. Just go away. All clear? Uhuh. I thought you'd be needing a refill about now. You are really very thoughtful, aren't you. You noticed that, did you? - It's hard to miss. What was that you played again? Tennis. Is that all you do? That is all I have to do, Cat. I am the fifth-ranking amateur in the country. Say, how are those muscles? Maybe I'd better get back to them. No. I don't .. - Relax. It's just another side of my thoughtfulness. I think I'll try that hot shower you suggested. I would. It will make you feel like a new woman. If that were only true, tennis player. Alright. Alright. Hey, Jasmine. You're a little late, Cat. The party is over. I am Vince Bryant. I guess this must be yours then? Keep it. Thanks. What is it? Who is there? Vince. Goodbye, Diana. Vince, please don't go. - Hold it, baby. But I love him. Let me go. - You don't need him. Don't you understand? He is my husband. Vince. What's so big about a husband? In six weeks you can have another one. Me, for instance. We'll have a ball, baby. My ideas and your money. We'll have a ball. It's just as well, Linc. Borneo is no place for a young man. They cut heads there. Now, if it had been Bali I could understand your reluctance to come back. Can we drop you anywhere? No thanks. It's not far. I'd rather walk. Goodnight, Michael. And thank you for a wonderful evening. Goodnight, Lois. Are we here? Diane. Oh. Hello folks. Hello Di. Hello. Faithful and noble Linc. Diana, what has happened to you? What are you doing in New York? Hello, mother. I didn't see you. You know, it's foggier here than it used to be. You are drunk. How could you come here like this? No place else to go. We are stone .. cold .. broke. We? Oh yes. Allow me to present my husband. Mr Howard. Johnny Howard. Hiya, cats. Good morning, mother. You wanted to see me? Yes, I did. I've had the feeling you have been avoiding me these last few days. No, mother. It's just that .. You are usually in bed by the time we get home. Do you feel any better? I might if it weren't for that. I am sorry. I'll see what I can do. Johnny. Johnny, can't you please stop it? Mother is trying to rest. I am sorry. I don't think I understand him anymore. It doesn't matter. It's you I want to talk about. You've been here for a month now. And I don't think you've drawn a sober breath for 24 hours in a row. I'd rather not discuss it. I am afraid we must. These are bills from every nightclub in town. Eleven hundred dollars' worth of bills. Child, what are you doing to yourself? Isn't that my business, mother? Very well. Then from now on your debts will be your business too. Diana. For your own sake you are not going to get another penny from me. Not until you can prove you won't throw it away as fast as I give it to you. Is that all, mother? Not quite. I'd appreciate it .. If you and your tennis player would leave here and find a place of your own. Alright. We'll start packing now. When you get settled someplace, write me. I'd like to know where you are. Alright. Just as soon as I know. Mother has asked us to get out. Okay. How much did you get? Nothing. Not a penny. No can do then, Cat. I'm stony. I know that. We are just going to have to go to work. Okay. You're still an actress, aren't you? You can make another picture. They wouldn't have me, Johnny. What about one of those sunstock things? It seems like everybody in New England is just dying to see a Barrymore. Drunk or sober. I can't go on making a fool of myself. Don't you see that? - I'm afraid you've got no choice. Your name is all we've got left. Unless you want to peddle girdles over a counter. You couldn't keep us in tennis balls doing that. How about your going to work? No can do. I tried it once. I used all the wrong muscles. You are really nothing but a leech, aren't you? You're wrong, Cat. I am a tennis player. Johnny, stop it. Nothing to worry about, wife. You just forget who your husband is sometimes. If you are going to call me something. Call me a tennis player. You are not a tennis player. You're just a weak, sadistic, tennis bum! You ought to do something about your mouth, Diana. It's bleeding. - Get out! Get out. I can't stand you anymore. I'll let you in on a little secret, Cat. That's the way I felt right from the start. Well, it was a race but I guess we made it. It wouldn't make any difference if we didn't. Here, I've got five more sets to build. And Fulton has me here chasing after a lush that ain't ever going to show up. How can you be so sure? Maybe she's gone on the wagon. Do you think this is the first bottle baby that's ever stood me up? She ain't going to be on the wagon any more than she'll be on this train. Actors. Well. Was I right or wrong? What car is she supposed to be in? '791'. 'Drawing Room A'. A sheer waste of money. As long as we're here, let's make sure. I'm sure already. Miss Barrymore? Please help me. Certainly, Miss Barrymore. I'll wait outside. What's up? - She's still getting dressed. Listen. Why not take the wagon and go on back? I'll wait for her and bring her down in a cab. What's her problem? She didn't confide in me but from what I saw it was .. A little bit of this and a little bit of this and a little bit of this. Uhuh. Now look, Wilcox. I know you kinda all stick together. But you can get yourself in a lot of hot water if what it is in there is this. We got a show to open on Friday and don't you forget it. I told you what it is. Won't you rather get back and build your sets? Or wait for her to snap? We'll be there in an hour. Alright. An hour. But let me tell you this. If anybody shows up at the theater loaded .. Anybody. They got a one-way ticket back to New York. Here. Give her these. With the compliments of the management. Are you ready? Almost. How much time do we have? About ten minutes. It's jammed out front. You can't breathe for the suprinella. Are you nervous? More than anybody who's going to the gas chamber. Opening night jitters. You will do fine. Say, did I tell you Fulton said if .. The play goes over here he'll open it in New York in the fall. With me in it? Why not? Fulton loves you. Ask him if he'd love me if my name was Diana Schultz. We don't have to kid each other about my acting, Bob. I wouldn't even try if I didn't have to get the money to pay off Johnny. You sure picked yourself a beaut, didn't you. The story of my life. And speaking of lives, I haven't thanked you for saving mine. Forget it. You'd have done the same for me. No. I mean it, Bob. Picking me up and .. Dusting me off. Making me feel like a woman again. I thank you most sincerely. You did the hardest part yourself. You didn't touch a drop for over a week. I haven't had to. I only drink when I am lonely. Diana. There is something we should talk about. You are not going to tell me you have a wife and three children? Worse than that. Diana, I am a drunk too. It's true I haven't touched a drop for eight months, but .. I don't kid myself I am cured. Especially when I begin to see my own storm clouds forming on the horizon. What do you mean, Bob? I mean we're no good for each other, Di. And never will be. But why? Why can't we help each other? Because of what we are. For people like us drinking is just a .. A symptom of a sickness that lies much deeper. With you. The real disease .. Is a need for a love so fierce that .. You make people prisoners trying to get it. Mine is much simpler. All my life I have .. Run away from any responsibilities that might make demands on me. When I can't run. I drink. I see. It's been eight months for me, Di. Eight months of feeling like a human being again. All I ask is that you don't try to cage me. If you do. I'll fall apart. Alright, Bob. I think I understand. From now on as far as we are concerned .. The play is the thing. Okay? Okay. To New York in the fall. To New York in the fall. Bobby. Huh? I did the best I could. You know that, don't you? Uhuh. I just can't act. We both knew that. You really do care, don't you? I care. I care. You care. He cares. We care. They care. You mustn't joke. - Diana, will you leave me alone? Bobby. Please. Please. [ Door knocks ] See who it is. I said, see who it is. [ Door knocks ] Mrs Wilcox? - Yes. A telegram. Sign here. Say, what's the matter with your lights? They are off. Why don't you turn them on? - They are shut off. Oh. Never mind, lady. Here. Maybe it says you've won the sweepstakes. Bobby. Huh? You know what? What? Mother is dead. They buried her yesterday. You said she was dead, didn't you? What do you expect? Money? I said, did she leave you any money? It doesn't say. It wouldn't do us any good anyway. It takes months. I don't feel anything. When your mother dies you are supposed to feel something. If you were there maybe you could have found her pulse. Don't say things like that to me, Bobby. You are the only one I have left. The only one in the world. You got to be good to me. Sure. I'll be good to you, baby. Just like you were good to me. Please don't start that, Bobby. We're together now. You have got to help me. I don't feel anything and I am frightened. You have got to help me feel something. If you still don't feel anything I can tell you .. You are feeling very, very wet. Bobby. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it please. Hey, Harry. Who is your friend? Now gentlemen, while Tassels is getting into something a bit more comfortable .. For our next number .. Please simmer down. Now, we're going to have some real uptown entertainment. I'm proud to present for your enjoyment. The daughter of a very famous family. The star of stage and screen doing her well-known and witty impressions .. Miss Diana Barrymore. Come on, let's give her a nice big hand. Diana Barrymore. Hey, Harry. I liked your first friend better. Thank you ladies and gentlemen for that wonderful reception. Now I would like to do for you some impressions of people you know and love. Bring back the dame. Go avay. I vont to be alone. I think we go home too, baby. You'd better hang on to that chair, honey, before you imitate a rug. I had on my radio. Honey, you look like they hit you with it. Go on. Take it off. Yeah, come on. - Come on. Come on, take it off. Come on, honey. Take it off. Yeah. Take it off. That's the girl. What is the matter, Harry? They loved me. They loved me. Sure they did, baby. Sure they did. They really did. Didn't they, Harry? I mean really. Down deep. - Absolutely. As a matter of fact I love you too. That is awful nice, Harry. I never knew that. Sure, honey. I love you so much I can't bear to see you out on that cold floor anymore. So why not just forget about showing up tomorrow night? I wouldn't want you catching cold out on that stage. Oh, that's awful sweet of you, Harry. Awful sweet. It's just my nature, baby. I am an awful sweet guy. Harry. Harry. Don't show up? Don't show up? Get the police. The police. Hurry. Get the police. Stop it. Stop it. Remember Mr Frank. The doctors made an exception in your case because of Mr Wilcox recent death. I remind you not to stay more than a few minutes. Visitors tend to be very upsetting to the other patients. I understand. Diana. You've got a visitor. I'll leave you alone with her. Well, Diana. Remember me? I am Gerald Frank. I met you a long time ago. I helped you mother with her book. You came home from school one day and I was there. You have said hello. That's right. You have a wonderful memory. They tell me you are doing very well. What do you want? I guess what I want is to put you and that memory to work. I talked to your doctor. He thinks it's a good idea. What is a good idea? For us to write a book together. About you. A story that a lot of people will want to read. If it sells as well as I think it will. You'd make enough money to get back on your feet again. I don't want to write a book about my life. Living it was bad enough. Maybe, in reliving it you'll find the reason why it all happened. Maybe you'll find one person you should have been looking for all this time .. Was yourself. I don't know anything about writing. I do. I'll help you. Where would I start? What would I do? You start at the beginning. And you work. You work very hard. But if you stick to it and finish it .. No-one will need to tell you that you've gone a long way to sorting yourself out. I don't know. Well. I'm not going to try and persuade you, Diana. That wouldn't be any good for either of us. When you leave the hospital. Here is where you can find me. I live on 10th Street. Near Washington Square. My wife and I have an extra room. If you like, you can stay with us. Until you find a place of your own. The thing to do is to grab the bus right outside the store the minute you leave. No matter when it is. If you let a few days go by. You'll start convincing yourself that one drink doesn't matter. Or you have finally found the man you always needed. He won't be, Diana. No matter who he is. No man could be right for you now. You know that, don't you? Yes. I think I do. Goodbye, Diana. I hope we'll see each other again soon. Alright, ladies. You're on your own. The clinic has got you on your feet. Now it's up to you to stay that way. Goodbye and good luck. Well. - Goodbye, Edie. It's not 'goodbye', honey. Just 'au revoir'. I .. My purse has been locked up for weeks. I forgot I had no money. I've got to get to 10th Street. So do I. Right about now. Please. Look. This is six o'clock Sunday morning, Duchess. Not Christmas. Can I help you, sister? Thanks very much, Jimmy. I'll see you in two weeks. Thank you, Mr Forester. I beg your pardon. I seem to have lost my purse. Linc. Oh, Linc. Diana. Diana, are you alright? - Leave me alone. You don't mean that. Don't look at me. Linc, please don't look at me. Please. You shouldn't feel that way. Not with me. We're still friends, aren't we? Linc, please go away. And forget you ever saw me. But I have seen you and I don't want to forget. You're in trouble and I want to help. - But you can't. You can't. I will. I'm not a boy any longer, Diana. Please. What? In a minute. I'm going to stop crying. And when I do. I want you to let me go. So I can turn my back. And walk away from you. If you are my friend you will do that. Alright, Diana. If that's what you want. I think I understand. You don't know about me. I threw my life away. I know all about you and you didn't throw it away. You chased it over a cliff. Diana, look at me. Don't ask me that. I can't. I am old. Ugly and changed. I can't ever be the same. None of us can. We are all changed. You are not. If I could prove it to you will you look at me? I promise you, a minute from now things won't seem half as black. I'll close my eyes. I won't open them if you don't want me to. Trust me, Diana. Just this once. Alright. Okay. Go ahead. See, I told you things wouldn't be nearly as black. Hey, it's not as funny as all that. Oh, Linc. I guess I'm not the only one life played dirty tricks on. Diana. Life is too short for you to go on punishing yourself over the past. You know, once all I had was a lot of money. I've got something else now. I'm a real nice guy. I know you are. I've always known that. Well then? Walk me to the corner? Have you got some place to go? Uhuh. 10th Street. Washington Square. That's where I was going when you came. What is there? The chance that .. Maybe I can get myself straightened out again. Di, you don't need any straightening out. All you need is someone to look after you. I'll open mouths of babes. No, Linc. Maybe someday I'll be lucky enough that that's all I'll need. But right now there are a lot of things I've done that .. Bear some serious looking into. Look. I know you don't have any money. Will you take some of mine? I promise you won't get bald. That bus fare was coming to you for it. I'll pay you back. I'll hold you to it. Here comes my bus. Do you really have to go? Hmm. I feel like a fool asking you to write from 10th Street. I'll write. Maybe even someday soon, I'll call. Do that. ..t-g..
