Yea? - So you're not gonna tell anybody? I could. I want a ticket. You want a ticket? Is that why you brought be back here? Well, I can't get you one. I don't have one.

You don't really seem to sleep. My mom used to sing down there when she was younger. When it was like a club. Do you wonder what was before? Before when? Before here. All of it. Not really. There was magic. I have a dream every night. My mom had it. Her mom had it. It's like a memory. It's a picture of the world as it was. But it's terrible. And it burns, and it fills me every night. And I can't sleep. The old lady who raised me after my mom died- She told me about the first one of us who had the dream. She said she was from there. Levithen. She said she was special. And the dream was given to her. To be kept secret. But then there was a shipwreck and she washed up on those rocks over there. and she was left here. I don't want the house. I don't want the dream. I don't want anything here. - and so if I can't get you a ticket? Moira- It's just another place- -Please. ♪ I'll keep you till I'm young again ♪ ♪ keep you when we're lost I'll keep you in ♪ Good job. Thanks. I wonder... ...if the dream that you have is good. Because in that time, with the world before... You wouldn't leave. Ya know, and we wouldn't be like this. Maybe it's good. I'm glad you found me. I'm gonna stay here tonight in the city at my old place and then tomorrow come meet me. and you'll go. You're uh... ...alive. Good to see you. How are you? Good. Good. So what? We have to try again? When we got seperated the last time... I got to the safe room, and I saw it. What? There's a ticket. At the top of that club, and I saw it the last time we tried. Anybody who comes with me tonight you guys can split it, it's yours. Take this, put this down. Take it, put it away. Okay. One of you... ...has a ticket, okay? You have 10 seconds. They know where it is, wheres' the ticket? FIND IT! Where's the safe?! Where's the safe?! Tell me where it is! - where's the ticket, where's the ticket... You good? -lemme look I'm okay I'm okay- -I'm not okay. Come on- A little less, okay- I gotta hold this, okay? You get it? Did you get it? Yes. Okay. Okay. You know I had a- - I had a dream. -last night. That you were uh- - you were with this beautiful girl. Different. And you were playing in the snow. And it was nice. Go. Go to her. I'm fine. I'm fine. Thank you. Go. Moira. Moira! Here, take her. It's okay, it's okay. You got her? Okay, just please take care of her. I can't take a baby! I'll come back! She should just be with you. It's okay... I never really thought about it. Before her. Maybe when I was a kid. I'd feel it. I could breath it in. This complete cold. Like a wind. A spell. And in time, I forgot- -the need of it- -the cold- -had left me. Until her. Winter. -she became it. Don't sell it. What's next? We sell it. Calm down. You all right? I can get you some uh-some stuff... ...to clean it. You own that? Yea. All right. You know how dangerous that is? Walking around... ...the city with a horse. It's worth a lot of money. Can I stay down here? More than tonight? I'll pay you. Just a few hours every morning I sleep late, I'm gone by noon. I just need some place to hide her. -Sure. I'm Eirah. I'm Hadeon. Do you have a pen? Sure. Pen. If I'm not here one morning... call this number. She'll take care of my horse. -I'm leaving. Two tickets, we agree? So we're both in an agreement? Two tickets? For one ticket. The other moves out of agreement. -What are we doing?- -we're good. It's good, we're doing half the deal. Where'd you get this? Where'd you get this? Look- - you don't think you're a good person, so you're gonna pass the ticket off to me so you feel better. I've no use for the winter. I'm an orphan. Or I was. A man found me. I remember it. The ship had left. I was on the rocks below the wal. So he took me to this woman. Because she had a dream. She had it every night. Like a curse. She couldn't tell anyone, but she told him. All I know is, I am what I am because of it. I came back to you because I'd like not to be. I'll go. Will you come with me? Hello! She's shot. Where is it? -on her back-lay her down. Oh, shit. It's black. I got her. Damnit! Fuck! Come on! It's okay. What? You go home. Forget about this- -she's my sister. You know who did this? No. But she said she was leaving tonight. On the ship. She said she met somebody, she was going with him. -so, Him. You look like her. -she's adopted. -Your mother. I knew her before. So you're him? What was she like? -she was magic. Thanks for bringing her here. She's my sister. You the one? -Get out. Go! Please. I'm waiting for someone. You told her you had a ticket. Who? -Eirah. Why'd you do it? She deserved something better than here. -so you killed her? What? Killed her? Killed her? No, who?! How'd you get shot? I had two tickets. Someone came for them. You're gonna bleed out. Thanks. -for what? -I don't know. She remembered you. For her... ...I was good. One last horse! Hello? Hello? Eirah, is that you? Is that you? It's me. What are you doing? I saw your daughter tonight. Which one? Both. Do you wanna? No. I was thinking... Whithren. You never come back down here? And what would I do? How was she? I saw her last month in the city, I was at this place.... there were all these people, and in the middle this girl. She was dancing. She turned and looked at me and... I knew it was her. I didn't even know if she knew who I was but I wanted to talk to her, so I... ...told her. Gave her where I live. She came back? And your other ones her own. She is. I was ready for her. Think I spent so much time trying to figure out how to be a mother to Eirah, that... I had time to ah... Hide myself. When her sister came along, ya know? I mean Eirah just walked right in. Went straight for the worst parts of me. And the good ones, too. All of it. When she was 15, yea-15... ...she was gone. So I guess that makes sense. You ever go? I'm about six miles down the road. Last cliff before the city. The whole time? You... said it burned? The dream. It does. Why? In that time, before... there's the possibility for it... ...to not be... like this.

And after, when Eirah came- - I tried to get another, I was gonna let you both go. ...but... now I've lost you both. We didn't lose her. She got across. She called me tonight. She didn't say anything, but I could hear the ship's engine. And the sea. So that's why you came back. -Moira. You can keep the shirt. Thanks. Am I ever gonna see you again? Never. Glad you found me. -Mom? That was him? Did he tell you? -Tell me what? Nothing. Can you see it now? The past. It's there, in your dream. A whole world, buried under us. One where the earth was alive.
