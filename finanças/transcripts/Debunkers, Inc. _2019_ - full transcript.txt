Are you focused? Yes. This is just a simple test, but it will show me how much you know. Now, I'm only doing this for your mother. I don't normally change my students' final grades. All right, now you come and demonstrate the test for me. And if I do it right this time, you'll actually pass me? Yes, that's right. Did I do it ri- Debunkers! Kiai! - Duty. - Honor. - Courage. - Cash flow. A company you can trust. We serve justice to those people in the United States. Call now for a special edition mug. So... Amazing, right? I-I really liked it. Vlod. Here we go. They typeface doesn't match our brand message. Plus there's not enough fear. It needs... more fear. Doc? I could tell that there was a lot of heart and sincerity. But... But don't you think that, maybe, people will be, I don't know, a little let down if they actually hire us. Why would you say that? Uh, well... Because we have solved a grand total of three mysteries. Two of which were for Doc's mom. She says thanks, by the way. Don't write off last semester's case of the ringing lockers. We are still school heroes. More like the school's most wanted. Okay, maybe, it was borderline snitching. Well, Link, I think you're missing the point. No, Snake, you're missing the point. Smoke and mirrors, fellas. Smoke and mirrors. We can't be focusing on where we're at now. We have to imagine where we're gonna be at the pinnacle of our success, and then project that to the world. Now, in the secret... The law of attraction... Is the key to success. I can feel it. We are attracting something big, something important. And just in time for a big day tomorrow. Senior year. The beginning of the rest of our lives. All right, Snake, what's next on the agenda? The omnipotent clipboard reveals. Intern? We don't have an intern. Yes, we do. Guys, I wanna introduce you to Lexy. Lexy, you can come in now. How long has she been standing there? Guys, Lexy's gonna be our new intern. Doc, can I, uh, can I talk to you for just a second? - Yeah. - Yeah, right over here. Okay. How old are you? Seventeen. Do you smell that? No. It's the smell of lies. You're the smell of lies. Hah. Touche. Outta mana. you may be immune to my mind control. So you must be well trained. No matter. Mark my words, I will break you, break you. - Doc. - Mm-hm. You gotta reel in your expectations a bit here. Okay? Look, I love the tenacity of wanting an intern. But these kinds of surprises, they throw a real wrench in our longterm vision. You see, there's a chain of command here. And if that chain is broken, well, this whole company's destined for bankruptcy. And remember, my name is Link for a reason. I-I know. Okay, so you-you have to ask me about these things beforehand. Okay. Before board meetings. I know. So we're cool? Yeah. - It's just that my mom... - You just want what's best for the company. I know, okay. We all do. No, it's that my mom told me I need to include her in, uh... Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, Lex. Oh, well, Lexy's from Canada, and she's here on an exchange program, and my parents are gonna be her host family for the next six months. Wow. You know what? That is great. I think diversity in the workplace is really, really positive. Uh, Lexy, go introduce yourself. - Uh... - Yeah. - Okay. - Come on. Um... Hi. My name is Lexy Baker. I'm from Halifax. It's a small town in Canada where nothing really happens. This is my first time in America. And I'm really excited to be here working with you... at... Debunkers LLC... Limited Liability Company. Nice, Lexy. We're happy to have you. I'm Link, founder and CEO. Dr. Mario, here, is our co-founder and chief investigative officer. And this fine specimen is Snake. Snake is our VP of Special Clandestine Maneuvers, as well as the secretary. We hired Snake just a year ago, and he's already a senior VP. See, Lexy, there's a lot of room to move up the ladder and succeed here, because we believe in upward mobility. The American dream is alive and well, Lexy. You're lookin' at it. But you're just an intern, and you'll be treated like garbage from this point forth. Now don't think we're gonna give you any kind of special treatment or anything because you're a girl, okay. We all started at the bottom. It's just part of the ethics of business. Now before you get settled in, make sure you read our workplace rights. Why do we still have that? Did you really just ask that question, Snake? I don't know. Maybe because it's the law. Your mom's the law. So, Lexy can stay? Lexy can stay. But first, she must answer the question. You don't really think she knows the answer to... the question, do you? Let's hope she does. Otherwise, she's out. Lexy... Who's your favorite Smash character? Um... Mm... Sheik She's in. As a true Debunker, your identity can never be revealed. Lexy is dead. Sheik rises. Now... to close off our last official board meeting of the summer, we have our most important item on the agenda. What is that? Sheik, do you know what this is? - A sign. - No. Wrong. Not a sign, a billboard. Do you know what we need to acquire ourselves a billboard, Sheik? - Paint. - Money. We need an operating income to get this bad boy so we can finally make ourselves visible to the world. We have to create an expectation of professionalism. Our mission is two simple words. The truth. What does truth mean? - Visibility. - Visibility. Thank you, Snake. Once we finally have enough money for this, we'll be legit. Well, I thought that's what the commercial was for. The commercial was the beginning of our marketing campaign. Link, I-I think it's great, really. But don't you think that maybe we should spend some time on getting clients or getting better at solving mysteries before we spend all this money on a marketing campaign? I'm with Doc on this one. The billboard's a bit excessive, although it is quite cool. Now. See, now you're gettin' it, Snake. Doc, I know it's hard to understand when you don't have a-a CEO mind like me. But being a business, it's not just about doing business. No, it's about looks. Being cool matters. Which is why tomorrow, when we all walk through those gates, every move we make matters. We must get our name on the lips of every student, faculty, and staff member at that school. 'Cause then, and only then, we'll be cool. And once we're cool, we'll be successful, and once we're successful, do you know what we'll get? Friends? Power. Dual citizenship? Money. Lots of money. And what about... the females? We don't have room for wishful thinking in this institution, Snake. You, of all people, should know that. But I'm not saying it's impossible. Sam. Uh... kay, guys, meeting adjourned. See you bright and early tomorrow. We got a big day. Here you go, Dad. Thanks, Sammy. How was your meeting? It was really good. We're growing pretty quickly. Love you, Dad. Love you too, buddy. I'm sorry, I-I... It's okay. Make sure you have everything ready for tomorrow. Big day, buddy. Did he go to any interviews? Oh, here. I made some flyers last night. We should put up 10 by the end of the day. Do you really think putting up posters is gonna work? Yes, I do. Do you have a better idea? It just seems like if you're a covert detective... Ey-ey, um... Don't forget you're still just the intern. Okay? Now had me some tacks. I don't have tacks. You're the intern, and you don't have tacks? - Are you serious? - Here. What? Did you forget to wear deodorant? Oh, shoot! - Oh. - Really, Doc. You cannot be standing - next to me. - I'm such an idiot! I have some. You have deodorant and not tacks? Perfect. Remarkable. Quick, put it on. Do not take your shirt off. Keep your shirt on! I have to take my shirt off, otherwise it'll stain it. Eight, 29, 16, 1300 hours. Hurry! This is the worst moment of my life. Guys, six o'clock. Hey, boys. What's up? Hey. Hi. My shirt was off, but now it's... It's on. Ooh, and a, uh, lady. What are you doin' hangin' out with these fellas? - Sh-she's our friend. - Intern. Same thing. Well, I dig the shirts, dudes. Oh, um, our marketing team designed these. If you guys would like to buy one, - they're available on Am... - Cool. What are the flyers for? Excuse me. Debunkers LL... Limited Liability Company. Excuse me? Our company. It's a pass through tax entity. Company? Wow. You guys actually own a company? Yes, we do. We filed in the state of Delaware last January. What kind of company? We're a partnership, but taxed as an S corp. What, y-you're a what? We solve mysteries and shed rays of light over dark shadows of illusion and fabricacion. Yep. Good job. Well... That sounds interesting. I'm Russell. - Uh, this here's Clark. - Hi. Um, I don't own a company, but my, my dad does, so... You guys must be seniors. - Yeah, we are. - Yes, yes, we are. Yeah, we are too. all of us. Well, good luck with the business, boys. And, uh, let us know how we can help. All right? We'll be around. - Yeah, great. - Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. Let's get outta here. Okay. Bye. Oh god, they were really nice. You just had to take your shirt off. Well, excuse me, Mr. Fabrication... Hey, hey, both of you... You're! Whoa, whoa. Dude, just let me... Commercial sign, no allowed. I find another... you get detention. Traitor. And to think, I took her in. Come on, guys. We should be happy for her. She's making friends in a new country. And losing others. Don't say that. Look at us. No leads, no friends. And to top it all off, our intern is the worst wingman in history. Guys, this is embarrassing. I despise this level. What level? You wouldn't understand. No way. Impossible. See, I told you she's loyal. All right, let me do the talking. Oh! Sorry 'bout that, boys. Uh... It's all right, hey, you probably got book insurance, right? Right? No. Because that's not a real thing. We do, however, have a great team of prosecuting attorneys. And fists. Don't think that'll be necessary, but it's nice runnin' into you boys again. Goin' deep, deep ball. - Yeah, hey. - Found it. Run the wide, run the wide! Sorry, guys. Um, I tried to get them to talk to you, but I failed. Yeah, ya did. It was a valiant effort, Sheik. It was too good to be true. Excuse me? Are you guys the Debunkers? - Hi, I'm, uh, Link! - Hi, I'm Dr. Mario. - CEO of Debunkers LLC. - Vice President of Clandestine Maneuvers. H-how can we help you? You're detectives? You guys solve mysteries, right? Yeah, we're the best in our field. We have a perfect record. Have you dealt with curses before? What kind of curse? The ghost of a murdered girl. Okay, go ahead, at your own speed. Don't leave out any of the details. Or smells. She was our friend. We took Chemistry class together this summer. School during the summer. So, a summer school. Yes, summer school. Hm, continue. Well, one day we just stopped hearing from her. We found out there was an accident. She was killed. Do you think you can describe for us the incident? As much detail as possible. Got it. What was her name? - Nina, Nina Galanosa. - Shh. Don't say her name out loud. No need to fear. Name taboos are quite common, but pure myth nonetheless. You haven't seen what we've seen. I know things. You mentioned a curse? Yes, where she died. Which was where? The Chemistry Lab. Classroom E12. The accident happened in there. - It wasn't an accident. - We don't know that, Joyce. We do know that they've kept it locked up ever since. So something serious happened in there, and things weren't adding up. So we went looking to see what we could find. You mean you entered the room? Yes... And we, saw... Okay, I don't know what we're doing 'cause you're not gonna believe us. You're gonna think we're crazy. What? What? What did you see? It's okay. You can tell us. You can trust us. We saw a ghost. And then we ran, and it followed us down the hallway screaming. I can still hear it. It's okay, it's okay. They say you can hear her crying in the women's bathroom if you listen hard enough. Women's bathroom, you say. W-we should go investigate immediately. Um, we're so sorry for how much you both have been through. Let us process this much, and we'll get back to you. Yeah. Snake, what was that? Yeah, you were about to scare them away. Excuse me for doing my job. It's our duty to take ever lead, but s... What? He has an idea. They said the entered the classroom. Yes, and... They said it was locked since the incident. So how could they have possibly gotten in? Excuse me, ladies! We just have one more question for you! A little snafu in your logic. Heather. How was your first day of senior year, sweetie? Oh, hello, boys. Uh, I'm your new principal, Ms. Barkley. And you are? Seniors. Well, I like the matching shirts. Well, enjoy your first day, gentlemen. And I will see you after rehearsal, Heather. Bye, Ms. Barkley. So, your mom's the new principal. Yeah, I don't usually like to tell anyone. So you got the keys from her office, then? And heard about the accident. I went in her office to go through student records after the accident. But if she ever found out, we'd be in so much trouble. Can you guys help us? Please help us. Make us believe we're not insane. Oh, you're not insane. Nay. You're but pawns in a cruel and unusual world. We will get to the bottom of it. Yeah, and do a full inquiry. Uh, but ladies, I do have to mention, a job like this will cost you. It'll involve a lot of work, subcontracting, insurance, top of the line equipment. Will a thousand dollars work? We can make that work. Thank you, seriously. We should do a full inquiry this afternoon. Not a moment to waste. And I got everything I need. What's that smell. The smell of truth. Emergency board meeting commencing now. - Start time, 4:57 PM. - I call dibs on Joyce. It's okay, you can be jealous. You wish. You can't call dibs on a girl. She touched me first, and we had a total of three moments in that conversation. Hey, guys. We need to stay focused here. Plus, clearly, Joyce was into Snake and Heather was into me. - Well, okay. - Copy that. - Show me the proof... - Can we just stay focused? - You're so jealous. - Hey. A thousand dollars. Guys, they're gonna pay us a thousand dollars to solve this mystery. This is exactly what we needed. Seems too good to be true. What if they're just making it up. They were crying. So? You're point? Her point is they weren't making it up. There was genuine fear in her eyes. Plus, Heather's mom is the principal. That's a primary reliable source. Yeah, did you see the way she was looking up at that classroom. I mean, it was so obvious, something is up. And we're gonna get to the bottom of it. Now, first thing's first. Sheik, I need you to make sure our business checking account is open and ready to intercept the thousand dollar payment when we receive it. Um... okay. We need to treat this like every other job and do our due diligence. Rats! What? Oh, I forgot to have them sign a contract. Idiot! What an idiot! Link, it's not the end of the world. Or is it? The second I get home, I'll do some background research. I'll go to the library and conjure up a floor plan. Well, I'll see if there's anymore witnesses. Okay, excellent. Hey, you're really gettin' the hang of this, Sheik. I need an update. Um, I found a janitor that has an eye witness report of weird sounds, - and I recorded it on... - Sheik, can you pick us up some pizza? Um, I was gonna explain to... Immediately. I'm quite hungry. Can I stay, because I... I am your boss. That was an order. Um... Okay, yeah. - Left, right, left, right. - I'm going. Keep the recei- What was that? I'm hungry. Snake, you've gotta get over it, man. Get over what? Having a girl around. I am more than capable of dealing - with the likes of... - Snake. Yes? Did you get the layouts? Yes. I have an entry point and an award winning break in strategy ready to go. Man, this place is a fortress. Private schools. All right, Doc. What have you got for us? Hit the lights. Okay, guys. I'm pretty proud of this on. We hit a goldmine, and these girls have no idea what they got themselves into. Look. Next slide. According to the Hawkview blog, six weeks ago, Nina Galanosa's body was found in classroom E12. Next slide. The cause of the death was never officially determined, but reports range from heart attack to allergic reactions. And since the event, next slide... there have been rumors of strange sounds coming from the classroom and mysterious anomalies happening in the hallways. "The ghost of Nina Galanosa lives on." says one student reporter. Sounds like an accident and runaway rumor. No motives. Sounds like it, but check this out. There are no records of Nina Galanosa's body in any city morgue, and she never had a funeral. That still doesn't make this a murder. There's no suspect, uh... Just wait. We haven't gotten to the best part, the summer school teacher. Next slide. Can you say quick promotion? Well, there's your motive. It doesn't feel right. Look at what Doc is telling us. Two girls have asked us to debunk the mystery of a cursed classroom, and one of the girls' mother could be the prime suspect of a potential murder. I must meditate. Guys! Wait, look what we have on our plates here. This could be the debunking of a century. A thousand dollars. It's just an inquiry. No harm in checking it out, right? Does expulsion count as harm? Snake... If you're out... Is my name not Solid Snake? All right. I'll make the phone call. Hello, Heather. This is Link, CEO of Debunkers LLC. We've conferred amongst each other and we confidently accept the job. We're gonna send over an invoice and a completed W-9. No, Heather, once this mystery is solved, and it will be, you can wire transfer the money to our accountant, We have an accountant? Fake email. Nothing more than a figment of Link's imagination. So, Heather, how does that sound? No, Heather. Thank you. Good, lift. Ey, Sammy. Where you goin'? Um, me and the guys have got ourselves a mystery to solve, Dad. A big one. Pick me up somethin' on your way home, will ya? Champ? You can do it yourself. Sammy. Sam. Phase one, completed. You're a natural, Sheik. Thanks, Doc. Yeah, not bad for a girl. Hey. Shh. Enough. What's next? They keep this place sealed up tight at night. Security will be patrolling, CCTV cameras rolling, motion detecting lights, and a plethora of other obstacles. But... Here's my plan. First, I pick the lock of the Attendance building and roll in unseen. Cartwheel. Ha. Old Glory, God bless America. There will be a security camera which... I'll swiftly evade. Then I'll engage security guard one. And eliminate quietly. Sweet dreams. Then my friends will join around me as we walk in a formation down a foyer. You hear that. Check it out. Why don't you go check it out? Link will plant the noise distractions, and I jump in with the hypnosis. Reach into your cargo shorts. Give me your keys. Then find a corner of the library and take a nap. Thank you. Then I'll be able to let you guys in the east gate, by the rose garden. Then the rest is slip and slide. Then we conduct our procedures, examine the evidence, crunch the numbers, solve the case, receive our award, and... live happily ever after. Brilliant work, Snake. Let's discuss a raise. Oh no. What, Sheik? What's wrong. I, um, kinda messed up. You forgot to open up the checking account, didn't you? - Oh no. - Link, it's fine. We have to complete the mission. No, it's not fine. If this account isn't set up, this whole thing is for nothing. You're right. This is all my fault. I'm gonna make it right. I'm gonna go now. W-wait, now? Yes, now. I won't let you down again. Yeah. Yeah, good. Go find out where our banker lives. Put that envelope at his front door so he will see it first thing tomorrow. Yes, boss. Good luck, boys. Link? - Why don't you go... - What are you do... That's the smell of fear. You don't think she's scared, do you? She's just an intern. We expected too much of her too soon. This is my fault. It's not your fault. The table is set. It's time to strike now. Snake's right. Keep with the Debunker code. Duty. Honor. Courage. Cashflow. On one. Apply slight pressure, insure pick at top of lock while applying slight torque. Pick back and forth in the key hole. Repeat until all pins are... Psst, you need help? I got it! Repeat until all pins... Huh. Hm. Okay, guys. It says here that if we continue through the theater shop to the stage, all we have to do is exit through the... Guys? Oh god. Link. Snake? Oh god. You guys better not be pullin' a fast one on me. I'll never forgive you for it. You guys know that I'm not supposed to be... I'm too young to die! Get a hold of yourself, man. I think I had a heart attack. You're fine. It's time to get serious. This is just the beginning. I think we just found our way out to the stage. Stay away from the light. Did I ever tell you guys I always wanted to be an actor. No, you didn't. And we don't care. The roaring of the crowd after a funny monologue, or gentle sniffles after a moving soliloquies. One day how I will find you glory, and I will have my hands outstretched to embrace you. - Hey, you. - Shh. How did you get in here? There's no students allowed after... I have been caught trespassing, and I am breaking the rules. Take me in, if you must. But first let me ask you. Do you persecute the determined? It's always been my dream to make the lead of the school play. Auditions are coming up and, honestly, uh, I just wanted to get ahead with a little practice. My father would disown me if he knew. That's why I can't practice this at home, you see. I know exactly what you mean. I always wanted to be a dancer. But my father forbade me. We fight the same battle in the war of passion. Now you listen, son. Don't be like me. Don't throw away your dreams. Now, you stay here as long as you'd like, and you practice like there's no tomorrow. Because... There may not be a tomorrow. Break a leg, son. He's an actor. What were you thinking? You almost blew this entire mission. Yeah, but I didn't. Did you see how I handled that in there? You were lucky. No, I knew what I was doing. That monologue. Link, where did it come from? I mean, look, we know some things have been going on at home, but is there, maybe, anything... What Dr. Mario is trying to say is we're supposed to be a team. What are we really doing this for? Huh? You always lecture us that we're this company about the truth. Well, as VP of Clandestine Maneuvers, I can tell you there is something hidden behind those eyes. Snake. Maybe calm down a bit. I'm fine with getting expelled from high school. But if it happens, I just wanna know why. You don't really believe in this mission. Do you? How could you say that? Because you're not being a true Debunker. You're selling out for a petty thousand dollars. Off again, hunting down fortune and glory over justice. Snake, that's enough. I am trying to keep this company afloat. Hm. Tell me what really happened then, huh? Tell me, Snake. Tell me what we've been reading, and hearing, and seeing, and then tell me that there's nothing mysterious about classroom E12. You're not being honest. Newsflash, neither is the rest of the world. I think we should split up. Uh, I don't think - that's the best idea. - You're right. We should split up? If we're caught together, our alibi becomes weak. The objective is to get to E12. No matter what happens, we meet there. I agree. Uh, well maybe, I could split up with one of you guys. It'll be all right, Doc. I believe in you. You can do this. Dear diary, location squandered. My target lies two clicks behind me, but two bogies sit in the way, and the path is treacherous. I could turn around and find another port of entry, but is that who I am? Someone who turns around. Someone who turns around. Ha. You're right. The answer lies within. I must meditate. Rats. Drug smugglers. Late night deal, eh? This is a major decision moment, Link. You can either move forward, remain ignorant, and complete the mission, or make the world a better safer place with less cons. No. Sheik, are you crazy? You almost just blew the whole mission. Sorry, um, I thought you would've silenced your cellphone on an assignment. What's going on? I'm outside the house, but there's a gate. So, climb over it. Seriously? Is this why you called me? - So how's it all going? - Oh my god. Um, we just split up. Things are going to plan. We should be at building E within the half hour. Okay, um, sending good wishes. Bye. Unbelievable. Oh god. Why are you doing this, Dr. Mario? Why couldn't you just have done a pet sitting job, like Mom told you? Oh god, it's dark in here. Okay. Go to your happy place. Ignore your emotions. Crap. Oh. You can do this. So you really thought you could get away with it. Do you have any idea who I am? Do you know the pain that I could cause you and your family? I did it before, and I can do it again. Oh my god. You were right. She's a killer. A cold blooded killer. Link, is a... Go on. Open it. May I help you? Principal Barkley. Oh, it's Monday. - Sorry, I forgot. - Yes. Carry on. Thank you. Good night. You know, if you've ever wanted any help, - I will always... - I will keep that in mind. Thank you. You got any sixes? Go fish. You sure about that? No sixes. Think. What would the greats be doing right now if they were you? What is your method? Who even are you, Link? Sherlock has his mind palace. Spade has crass intelligence. Colombo's got wits. What will your legacy be? Phase one completed. Initiating phase two. Oh. And the three horns are representative of love, devotion, and spirituality. Well my maiden last name was Ignatovich. - Oh. - So they called me Iggy. And I had a brother... No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. - Snake, Snake. - Doc. Ah, we all made it. You guys. You won't believe what I saw. Breath, Doc, breath. I did it before, and I can do it again! Oh, good heavens. She's a monster. A blood sucking monster. My apologies, Link. You were right. There seems to be some truth to this, after all, this whole ordeal. I was wrong. No, no one is right or wrong. This just means we can't give up now. Time is of the essence. The sooner we can solve this mystery, the sooner we can find the proof to put that evil woman behind bars so she can no longer do the world harm. It was first class detective work, Dr. Mario. Thanks. And now, the final level. What the hell is that? Shoot, that's my alarm. It's been four hours. We need to take a lunch. A lunch? Yeah, union rules? Yeah, we can only work four hours at a time, and we have to take a 30 minute lunch break in between. - Didn't you read the... - Listen to yourselves. We are in the middle of solving a crazed mystery yet. Not to mention breaking and entering. We are not about to take a 30 minute break! Now, you guys just don't understand what it takes to run a company. I give up. Snake, Snake. You can sit and take your 30 minute break. I'm gonna go debunk a curse and solve a murder. Come on, Doc. Wait, wait a minute, guys. I-I think I have a solution to this. Let me find it. Here. It says here workers may voluntarily waive the right to a lunch, if by their own freewill. - Let me see that. - You guys. You can't be serious. Well, it's legit. Dr. Mario's right. Well, let me hear it then, Doc. Do you waive your right to your lunch break? I hereby happily waive my right. Seriously? Just say it. Yes! I waive my right! Great, we can continue. Has he always been like this? Been like what? Positivity. Positivity. I am a volcano in a calm body. Stop. Look. Blood. Old blood. You sure? I know blood when I taste it. Why? Everything from here is a potential clue. Keep your wits about you. Forward. Hold that up? Now we're talkin'. N. G. Nina Galanosa. Do you think we're really equipped for this. I mean, guys, don't we think we're a little bit - out of our league here? - We're in the jungle. The only way out is through. Or we could just go back out the way we came. Not the time to wimp out, Doc. I'm not a wimp. I'm not a wimp. The stairwell's straight up ahead. Oh-oh god. Oh, Doc. It wasn't me. I've smelled this stench before. I just can't remember where. - Oh my god. - We must be getting closer. E12 is just on the other side of this building. Wait a minute. Something's not right. The blood, the writing, the smell. What do you mean? It all makes perfect sense. These are the most obvious clues I've ever seen. Okay, I see your point. You guys see that? What the hell is that! Whatever it is, don't let see us! Guys! It's coming from the intercom! Keep moving! That's what you are! Reveal thyself! I live for this! Snake, what are you doing? You're gonna get us killed! It's evil, Doc. That's fear, real fear! Go, go, go! Guys, the classroom. Home run! Huzzah! Oh god! Oh my god. It's even better than I could've possibly imagined. Oh, man, he peed himself. He peed himself? - Oh, that is... - He peed himself. Get the... Sorry, guys. I bet you worms think you're real funny. No, but you do. Reveal thyself, spirit. I should've known. You did. We all did. I don't understand. - The girls? - Mm-hm. The girls were lies. Gotcha. You mean you guys, like, actually all believed us the whole time? So you guys did all this? You set all of this up just... just to mock us. - Just to mock you? - No. Oh no. This was revenge. You don't know what I'm talkin' about, do you? - They don't even know. - No. Last year, you three twerps ruined what would've been the greatest senior prank this school has ever seen. Do you have any idea the organization it took me to get every single senior to set their alarm to 12:01 and leave it in their lockers? You told the principal. And once he found out it was me and Clark, we were suspended. And now we're repeating senior year. I mean, hell, I'm gonna throw another 20 TDs to this guys this season. That's my boy. But you just provided us with, easily, a years worth of entertainment. I mean, I mean, the shirts? The flyers. The flyers, the company? Thank you. That was a real gift for us. Yeah, yeah, Christmas can't - even beat this. - Yeah. Or New Years. - And I love me some New Years. - We love New Years. - Nor. - We do. Huh? That would be nor New Years, you delinquent. Oh, look who decided to be a smart little teenager. - Okay. - It's not worth it, Snake. Oh. You should listen to your - friends, Snake. - Almost scary. Okay, guys, that's enough. They get it. I trusted you. Oh-ho. - Oh my god. - Trusted. No, no, no. No, check this out. Little pee-pee pants got a crush on my girl. Ooh. Guess what? The real fun starts tomorrow. When we show the whole school who Debunkers Co really is. - It's Debunkers LLC. - Okay. - No one knows what... - What does it even - stand for? - that means. All right! Doesn't make any sense. You guys wanna ruin our lives at this high school? - Yeah, we do. - Yeah. - I think we just did. - We really do. Fine! Okay, we accept our fate. Now can I at least ask some questions? Ooh, he wants to know how we did it. We already know how you did it. Obviously, you got the keys to the school from Heather's mom and got in without a problem. That's right. - That was us. - One of you did the invisible ink, and then you probably recorded sounds and played them over the intercom speaker, which you would've had access to via the principal's room. Simple fog machine under the classroom door, and uh... Hydrolated ammonium sulfate. - Ooh. - Uh. - A fart bomb. - Oh, all right. For the smell of death. I knew I'd smelt that before. Great job, Einstein. And the writing on the walls. Recently graffitied, still wet. Childish. Yeah, sorta like peeing - your pants. - Peeing your pants? I still don't understand. I saw Principal Barkley in her office with someone else, and she was in the middle of ta... - Ugh. - Boredom. - Just then. - Falling asleep. Me too. Let's go to Sylvia's party. - Let's do it. - Yeah. Get home safe, Sherlocks. - We did a debunking. - Bye. But what about the blood? What blood? The blood at the entrance of the building door. Uh, okay, guys. I think that your imaginations are running a little too wild. So the blood wasn't your doing? What blood? Whoa. Whoa. Guys, that's enough. They get it, okay? No, no, no, babe. This isn't us. Do you see that? Hey. Hey, pal. Show your face. You're not scaring anybody. What the... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Remember, guys, it's not real. Okay! Somebody's gotta be messing with us. Okay, that was like a real, that was a real skeleton! Th-that, that Nina Galanosa, did she really die? I don't know. This wasn't supposed to be real. Well, look who decided to be smart. Well, you saw it too, man. What am I supposed to think. You boys know what to do. Stay to the course. - What is he... - We've been through - this before. - What are you saying, - you little nerd! - Hey! You know the chain of com... What's going on! Hey, guys, stop it! Taken three weeks ago. Now I will take three of you. Who will it be? Who will it be? Screw this! - Look out! - I'm outta here! Whom will it be? Take us! Take us, and let Joyce and Heather leave! Go, girls. Go now, and tell everyone what happened here today. Thanks, Doc. Bring it on! Any ideas? Um... my time. Utility closet! Go! Let's clog that ghost up! Let me at it, I'm ready! It's not real. Okay, it can't be. Remember guys, there was always an explanation. Think now. We know they didn't plant the articles online, but we all read them. We saw Barkley in her room, but uh... But nothing. We know it was Principal Barkley. Heather was just trying to get us back for Russell, when really she was exploiting her mother's crimes. It wasn't Barkley. What do you know? After we split up, I saw Barkley and Anderson just walking casually down the quad. We just must've misread something. You knew, and you didn't tell us? Even after we were humiliated. Look, we needed to continue the mission. When this job is finished and this mystery is debunked, I'm gonna take my cut of the thousand dollars, and I'm out. No, Snake. I can't be working with someone who doesn't understand what it means to trust. Snake, you don't mean that. He doesn't mean that. Right? That... that-that he's not gonna be a Dubunker anymore? He's right. He shouldn't work with someone he doesn't trust. Neither should you, Doc. My dad lost his job. That's what's been goin' on at home. He got fired, and he's just been lettin' himself slip into oblivion ever since. All he does all day is drinks Diet Coke and watches movies while he withers away in his chair. And the worst part is that I help him do it. I think I'm killin' him. I will not end up like him. All right? I'm gonna make something of myself so I can support my mom, so we don't have to worry about all this surviving crap. Money is causing my dad to want to not live anymore. Stupid freakin' money. Now that, to me, is a mystery that I will never be able to solve. You wanna know the truth. I need to solve this mystery, no matter how thin. I need this company to succeed. I need you guys. That's the truth? The truth. Swear it? What do we do now? I think... Emergency board meeting commencing now. I think I might just have a plan. It worked. You can come out now, Dr. Saginov. Ah-ha! Well done. Well done, boys. No more accent. Nope. And that's our little secret. You've got some explaining to do. What happened to Nina? I'll make a deal with you, boys. I'll tell you the why if you tell me the how. Careful, Link, you could be talkin' to a murderer. Okay, Saginov, we'll play your little game. But no one's leaving here until you prove your innocence. Okay. You first. Well... It's like I always tell the guys. Smoke and mirrors. With the right mixture of fog, a well placed mirror, and the school's smart board projector, you made yourself a nice homemade apparition. Easy enough, and the rest? Principal Barkley, she was the MacGuffin. When I saw her in her office, I thought she was punishing Mr. Anderson. A ploy for power, I suspected, just like her move on Nina Galanosa. A simple mistake about expectations. You see, you wanted Principal Barkley to be the suspect, so you made up evidence to prove that theory. What made you change your mind? I saw Barkley and Anderson walking down the quad together. Through meditation, I retraced our steps from the other day and remembered. Well, enjoy your first day, gentlemen. And I will see you after rehearsal, Heather. Show him the video, Doc. Scripts. Running a scene. Principal Barkley wants to be an actress. Mr. Anderson was probably just helping her run her lines. Barkley is out. And once Russel and his minions didn't mention the blood, we knew we were on to something. And how did I know it was you? How did you know it was me? The blood, the real blood. I know real blood when I taste it. It was from a dead pig. I your science class this morning, I saw the pigs frozen for period three dissection. Oh, by the way, the uh, skeleton was a nice touch. Something every science teacher has in their arsenal, no doubt. But you wanna know when I really knew? Taken three years ago, I was. It's a pretty odd way to talk, don't you think. Strangely similar to our little run in this morning. Commercial sign, no allowed. Very perceptive. And that still leaves Nina Galanosa. The poor girl who never existed in the first place. You passed. You can come in now. Sheik! Actually, it's Vicky, Vicky London. But you, you, you're... Surprise. - You're... - Vicky is one of our best field agents. Something of a protege. You know, she has over 40 aliases? I'm not even sure if Vicky London is her real name. And you'll never know. It's been a real pleasure working with you boys. You're an interesting bunch, that's for sure. But capable of great things. I knew you weren't normal. I know somethin' was off. No average girl is that immune to my mind control. So, are you saying I'm not an average girl. Of course. How could I have been so clueless? Sheik. She picked Sheik! Holy crap, she picked Sheik. Uh, I-I'm lost. I-I still really don't understand. Zelda. Ocarina of time. Of course. You boys have some vivid imaginations. You probably had the whole evil murder worked out in your minds. That imagination will get you far, but it can also be your weakness. Something you'll have to work on as we continue. We? I think I'm starting to understand. So that's why you set all this up. So now I'll tell you the why. We started small, but we've been recruiting across the country, and we're growing rapidly. We've been keeping an eye on you boys for a while now. Ever since we saw your commercial online. We only take the best and the brightest. So I sent Vicky in as a foreign exchange student. She got to know your inner workings, reported back to me periodically to let me know that you have what it takes. That day in the hallway, I found out that Russell and his gang wanted to make a fool of you guys for payback. So I suggested the story of Nina Galanosa. A story that Dr. Saginov and I invented. If you boys weren't so distracted by your feminine interests, you may have suspected this much. She was my eyes and ears from that point out for our test. My real name is Alfred Carmichael. But the world knows me as Igor Saginov. I too am in the clandestine field. He's being modest. He runs the field. Alfred Carmichael? Like the Alfred Carmichael, who disappeared in Chernobyl in 88? Raisin Corp? We can't be too obvious, now can we? I run an underground incubator, an international cohort of skilled detectives, like Ms. London here, who have dedicated their lives to espionage and solving mysteries, just like you. This is the big leagues, the assignments that help keep the world safe at night. Did I die? Did the ghost just kill all of us? So you were scouting us? Yes, we both were. At first, I would have advised against you advertising your business so openly. But I spoke with Ms. London, and we both realized... It's the perfect cover. The double bluff. I would officially like to make Debunkers the invisible face of mystery solving. I could provide you with startup capital, some resources, and skilled field agents that will assist you. Now, you'll have to provide some reliable alibies to your families and keep up the facade that your business is unassuming and innocent, and run by kids with wild imaginations. How much startup capital are we talking? Say... $10,000? Oh my god. So, do we have a deal? - Take it. - Yeah, yeah. - We do, yeah. - Take it. Take the money. Take the money. Oh, and by the way... Let's make you guys legitimate. Drop that LLC. Let's make it Incorporated. Debunkers Incorporated. Well done, boys. You passed. I can't believe I let a spy into our office. Will you forgive me for being deceptive? You're Sheik now. You'll always be Sheik. A true Debunker. So, will I see you at home? I told your parents my father is having surgery in Calgary. A white lie. Tell them thank you again for me. So this is goodbye. No. This is hello. What in the world? Got a plan for this one? Um... run. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on! Stop right th- I thought we bonded. Thank you. For what? For... inspiring me to... get outta my chair. Did you solve the mystery? Yeah. Yeah, I did. $10,000 has been deposited, and we are officially a C corp in the state of California, and what are these? Night vision. Snake, you can't just spend the money however you want. We've already made expense reports, and this is not on it.
