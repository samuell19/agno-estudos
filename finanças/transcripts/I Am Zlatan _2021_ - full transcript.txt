Remco. Stay alert! Zlatan, you're behind! You're behind! Come on! You're walking like a snail. Come on! Are you tired? Good. Find some space! Yes! Okay! Gather round. Come on. At middle! Zlatan, come on. -What are you doing? What? -What? I asked what you are doing. I'm here. The rest is already here. Why can't you walk faster? You have something with your ears? Or what? -No. -No? No. If you don't want to respect me, then maybe you should respect the group. The group is already here. You want a special position? Your special position is outside the field. You can go home. Thank you! Alright! We'll do the same thing again. A little more active. After the loss over the weekend, it's clear: Ibrahimovic doesn't deserve to wear the Ajax jersey. If it hadn't been so sad for Ajax, for the supporters and Leo Beenhakker who took him in, you would be laughing at it. It's that hilarious. I would like to insult that lazy Ajax immigrant so that he'll go home... Hey, pass the ball! Pass, pass, pass! Over here! Pass! In! Really good! Yes! That's it, boys He scored so many goals on you! Leave your shoes on the bench. How many goals have you let in, Zlatan? Shut up! At least 10, I think. You're the worst. What are you doing?! What? Go get the ball! I'm not going to go get the ball. Listen, hey! Don't push me! Listen, go get the ball, do you understand? I'll go get it, but not because you told me to, but because I want to. Kevin, stop playing football now. Come home! Pass the ball! What are you looking at? Pass the ball! Pass the ball! Sh.t! Is he alive? Is he okay? Come here, fast! We have to call someone! Listen up! Zlatan? Are you alive? Sh.t, he might be dead! Is he breathing? Sh.t, I don't think so. Get his mom. We have to do something. Zlatan? Hey, guys! I was just taking a little break. What's wrong with you? Get up, dude, you piece of sh.t! The bags, two bags. Wash your hands. Food. Never mind that, just two bags. It's only two weeks... Get out of here! Then put them in the closet. What are we eating? What happened to your head? What have you done? And you've ruined your shirt, what happened? -I fell off a roof. -What do you mean, roof? -Mom, it wasn't my fault! -Look what you did! The things you get up to! Go wash your hands! Mom, it wasn't my fault! Mom! Sanela What?? Mom! You need to pick up Keki tomorrow. I can't. Can't you see that I don't have time. You have to help me. Don't talk back to me, you're helping me and that's that! What did you do? What did you do to your eyebrow? Nothing. I'm going to play hockey. You're going to start ice hockey? Yeah, what? You can't afford that. Do you know how much pads cost? I'll play without pads, I don't care. Good luck. Good luck, yourself. Keki, stop. Listen, I have to go to work. Finish eating and help Sanela pick up when you're done. Keki should be in bed before 10 PM. That's when I'm back, okay? Okay. "He had..." "He had not eaten anything all day." "And where was he going to get food?" "Fear came creeping with...twilight." Zlatan, stop it! Who, me?! Cut it out! I don't want to hear it right now. It wasn't even me! Alex, come on! Jump on! Fast! We got it! Laurent Blanc. Stefan... Stefan what? Schwarz. -Schwaltz? -Schwarz. Oleg Sergeev. Who the hell is Thomas Ravelli? Look at him. What the hell? Where are van Basten and Baggio and them? Dad, they're great! Look, what we got Mom! Very nice, my son! Nike Air Max. Okay. We'll see you tomorrow! Okay. -Who wants ice cream? -I do. Okay, let's go. Everything okay at Mom's? Yeah, it's good. Dad, are you coming to practice on Tuesday? Of course, my son. Weren't you going to start playing hockey? Shut up, Sanela! Nobody's talking to you. Dad! Dad! Look, I got van Basten! -Who is he? -Van Basten. He's like Bruce Lee and Muhammad Ali, but in football. Like Muhammad Ali? Okay! "Float like a butterfly." "Sting like a bee! Rumble, rumble!" Bravo, my son! You can leave everything on your desks. See you in 15 minutes. -Hi, Zlatan. -What, mamma? -What do you mean, what? -My name is Anneli. I scheduled this meeting so we three could talk a bit. Zlatan is very lively. He has a hard time keeping still. This creates an environment that is a disadvantage for the other students. So I will be in the classroom more often to help you. I think it will be very good. What have you done now? Nothing, Mom. In that case, they wouldn't have called me. They always blame me! Don't raise your voice to me. You're lying to my face. It's always something with you. Hi. What happened? -Nothing. -But it's always something. Let's go. Good job, boys! Come on, guys! Pass the ball! Boys, we're done for today! Gather round. Hurry up, boys! Well done! That's really good to see. You need to remember to look up and see each other, okay? Okay, and show yourselves. Call out for the ball. We have to remember that football is a team sport. We're working together here, right? Zlatan, are you listening? Yeah, I'm listening, but are we going to talk or play? We're going to play but if you're going to have that attitude, you can sit on the sidelines. Okay, back out there! Do you want a ride? No, it's good. My Dad is on his way. Okay. See you Wednesday! See you. So how do you know this Miroslav? Are you friends? Yes. And you have no idea where the stolen goods came from? No. Go to your room. Go to your room. Why are you here? Go to your room. Mom, I'm hungry! Go to your room! -I'm hungry. -We'll have dinner soon! And you haven't seen the watches before? He just wanted to leave the bags here. What's going on? Why is the cop here? It's not her fault. Let it go. What's "not her fault"? That stupid idiot tricked her. Just let it go. Keki, come on! You should be sleeping. -It's really late. -No! -Keki, come on! -No. Take it! You want some? No, I'm...I'm good. If you want to be my client, you shouldn't be late. Christian Vieri. 27 games, 24 goals. Filippo Inzaghi. 25 games, 20 goals. David Trézéguet. 24 games, 20 goals. Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 25 games, 5 goals. How do you expect me to see you with stats like that? If I scored twenty goals, even my mother could be my agent. You think you're cool. You think you impress me with your gold watch and your Porsche and your...Gucci jacket? You sure? Because I can make you into something.- But then you have to do exactly what I say. You're going to work three times as hard. And you're going to sell the gold watch and the Porsche. Miss! The same for him. Come on! Faster! Faster! You lazy bastard! That's good energy, come on! Come on, guys! That's more like it! You dance the ring dance. Yes? -Is this native tongue class? -Yes. You're Tony Flygare, right? Welcome. We're working on vocabulary words right now. You can sit there, next to Zlatan. You're from Rosengard, right? Yes. And you? Annelund. Okay. Quiet! You two can get to know each other later. You play football? Yeah. You? For Balkan. You play for Balkan, I play for MBI, but I'm thinking of quitting, they're crap. That's enough! I already told you to be quiet. Maybe you need me. Yes? Hi. I need to bring Zlatan to the principal's office. Zlatan, you are excused. Why are we going to the principal? I don't know. Come in! Hello! Hello. -Hi, Dad! -Hi, kids. Sit down. Your dad has something to tell you. You know that mom... She's having it pretty hard. So we decided... What did you decide? That you'll live with me. We're going to live with you, Dad? -For a while. -Why? It's decided. But you can go to Mom whenever you want. Not a problem. No problem. But it's not Mom's fault. It's that damned idiot's fault, he's the one who tricked her. I know, Sanela. But it's decided. Come on, Balkan! Come on now, Balkan! Balkan, go, go! Come, on, Balkan, get the ball! Balkan, go! Tony, Tony! Pass! Pass! Zlatan, come on now. We're going now, okay, Keki? Where are you going? Just over there. It's okay. I'll be back soon. You stay here with Mom. Okay, Keki? Vi ses. Bye, Mom. Ciao, Mom. Goodbye, my children. See you. I have the bed. You take the mattress. Get off my bed, I'm not sleeping on some hobo mattress. I have the bed. You take the mattress. Why do I take the mattress? I'm older and deserve the bed. Deserve? You don't deserve anything. Go lay down over there. Hey, what are you arguing about? She wants me to sleep on a hobo mattress. I'm older. I get the bed. Nobody is sleeping on a mattress. We're buying a bed. -Say what, Dad? -Come on! We're buying it now? Come on! The bus. We'll take the bus. -Wait! -Come on! -Hello! -Hi, hi. You have hot dogs here, right? Yes we do! -Dad, can we eat here? -With home delivery. Dad? That will be 1.524 crowns, please. -Dad? -What? No, no. The bed costs 1.099. Home delivery costs 425. 400 for home delivery? No delivery. I'll take it myself. You get one crown back. I can take the crown. -Do you want the receipt? -No, thanks. Dad, aren't we going to eat? Come on now! Dad? Zlatan, hurry up! Wait for me! Let's go! Hurry up! Come here, you have to see something! Bravo, Šefik. Good job! Yeah, yeah, just like a donkey. Dad? Can we order pizza? Okay. Can we watch Bruce Lee? Okay. And Muhammad Ali? Sure. That'll be good. Yes. That'll be good. Are you Zlatan? Yeah, that's me. Have you played football before? -Yes. -Good. Welcome to Balkan. Okay, gather round! Come on! Push, push! Pick it up! Pass! Ref, hey! Buddy, what's your name? Zlatan. "Liberated the village, as they say.." Dad, I'm playing for a new team-Balkan. -Everyone said... -Quiet. You should have seen my sick goals! Look what those bastards are doing. The woman was hit this morning on her way to work. Can we order pizza? Shut the hell up! Get out of here! Damned kid. Look what they're doing... Hey? What is there to eat? You can make a sandwich. -Isn't there anything else? -No. F.cking sh.t. How did practice go today? It was really good, actually. Good. I'm moving back to Mom's. What? I already talked to her. She said it's okay. Why? I miss Keki and... All of this with Dad. They're killing his friends down there. What? Haven't you seen the news? What are you talking about? It's war down there. You should come to Mom's too. No, I'm staying with Dad. Good night. Good night. Zlatan, look at your own test. I'm looking at my test. You're looking at the others. I haven't looked at anyone's test. It's a test, look at your own test now. Not anyone else's. I'm not looking at anyone else's, I'm looking up in the air. I saw you looking. I saw what I looked at. Stop it. You stop. -What do you want now? -Concentrate. Is it hard? Do you want help? I have all the right answers. Do you want to check them? I can look later, right now you finish. Don't bother the others. You're bothering me. Both of you are bothering me! Calm down, Zlatan. I am calm. You are the ones making me angry. Stop it. You stop! Cut it out. Go back. -Go and sit down. -I'm not going anywhere! Let's go sit up front. Come on. I'm not going anywhere. Anneli, listen to me. Let me go! You heard what the teacher said. Yes, you are and bring your test. Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Stop it, Zlatan, come on! Go stand somewhere else. I'll take my test here. Let go of my test! Come on. Come. The rest of you, go back to your tests. -Do you have to sit here? -Yes, I do. -Why? -To keep you calm. And so we don't bother the others any more. Start by keeping yourself calm. What the hell are you laughing at? -Don't worry about them right now. -Zlatan! -I'm about to kick you out! -I'm not leaving! Go with Anneli, leave now. No, I'm not going anywhere with damned Anneli! That's it, Zlatan! Out. All the way! Look, she's staring. Isn't that your new girlfriend? Shut up! What do you mean, girlfriend? No, no, no! Are you okay? Zlatan, what are you doing? Are you okay? Zlatan! What's this about? Yeah, yeah. Well, we have to talk about your son. Zlatan has been very disruptive. I see. And who are you? My name is Anneli. I'm an extra resource at this school. I've been following him for a while now. It's become clear to me... What has he done? Quite a lot. But the most recent is today, he shot a floor ball into Anneli's face. How do you know it was on purpose? I saw him aiming at me. And the Physical Education teacher saw it too. It was on purpose, wasn't it? You aimed directly at me. We've had other problems as well. The Principal and I have spoken. We think an alternative for Zlatan would be to put him into a special school where he can get help with other things, and where there is also a different psychosocial environment. Psychosocial? What are you saying? That Zlatan is psycho... No, no! We want him to get help. Do you know what "Zlatan" means? -No... -Gold! He is the golden boy. The best, finest boy in this school. Yes, but he has... You know who in here needs psycho help? You. And you. I will talk to him at home. I will fix this so that he will be in school tomorrow. Let's go! Goodbye! It would be good if... Goodbye! Dad, you showed them! You should have seen her face, she was so surprised..! Hey, you listen now! I'm not coming here again and listening to them talk bullsh.t about you! No more! Is that clear? You will show respect! Without an education, you are nothing. You want to be like me? No. You are going to be a lawyer. Lawyer. Is that clear? Do you understand what I am saying? Yes. Alright, then. F.cking car... Been chopping trees. I done something new for this fight. I done rassled with an alligator. That's right. I have rassled with an alligator. I done tussled with a whale. I done handcuffed lightning, throwed thunder in jail. That's bad! Only last week, I murdered a rock. Zlatan! Substitute! What? You hear me. Off the pitch. Zlatan, why don't you ever pass? Good, Tony! Bravo! Shoot! Yes! I swear it. If he hadn't subbed me out, I would have scored. Sure. What do you mean, "sure"? Tony, can we talk? Hi! Zlatan, go in and change. We're going to talk to Tony. This is Janne from MFF. -Hi. -I'm Tony. You had a really good game. I'm going to play for Malmö! What? I'm going to play for MFF! -Congratulations. -Thanks. I'm going to play for Malmö! You are? Okay, okay. Listen. Tell Samir that I'm going to send money through Western Union. Exactly. Western Union. U-Ni-On. Right. Tomorrow, yes. I want the meal deal, 150 gram size. -Okay. -Or, you know what? Make that a super size meal deal, and a hot dog with mashed potatoes. Hello? Hi there's a game in ten minutes! Are you coming or not? I'm coming now. I'm on my way now. Bye! Dad! Dad! Dad! You have to drive me to my game. It's starting now! Dad? Come on, Vellinge! Nice work! Come on, now! Work home, boys! Go, Vellinge! Good, Vellinge! Talk to each other! Look! Look up! -Dino! -Hi, I'm here. Go sit down. Just let me play. Sit down! I don't have time for this. Don't I get to play? No, you don't get to play. Coach Let's go! Pick it up! Get here on time next time. Sit down. Come on! Good lord, why don't they just take the ball... Come on! Watch the middle! Come on! Let me play! Coach? Edin, substitute! Zenit, defender. Zlatan, come on. In the game. Show me what you've got, you cocky little sh.t. Come on, Vellinge! Let it go sooner, Zlatan! Come on! Hey, Zlatan? Wake up! They called. They talked about you. What? They said you made eight goals yesterday. Dad, you should have seen how I feinted, left and right. -I made a sick goal! -Good, good! I know, I know. We talked a bit, we discussed it. And you're ready to try out to play for Malmö. What? Malmö FF. A real club. So behave yourself. And work at it. Okay? -What are you doing here? -What? What are you doing here? I have tryouts for the Junior League. That is not not here. That's pitch 10, farthest down. We don't play here? No, farthest down. Pitch 10. Hi. Are you Zlatan? -Welcome. -Thanks very much. Gather round, boys! We have a new guy today, Zlatan, who has played with Tony for FBK Balkan. He's here to try out with us for a few days. Did you see? Huh? How could he replace me? Is he f.cking stupid or what? What? What? What now? F.cking idiot... Don't f.cking hang up on me! Never! Okay. So what?! I've done everything you wanted. I train three times as hard. I score goals. I'm driving around in a f.cking Fiat! So what if I kick a sign? He shouldn't have replaced me. Of course he replaced you, you were sh.t! Okay. Move to Torino, then. What did you say? Huh? Maybe I have Juventus for you. -What? -You heard me. Juventus wants to buy me? Are you for real? Maybe! Maybe! I'm working on it. So be quiet. But then you have to stop to go around kicking f.cking signs! Grow up! No more baby stuff! In Italian, we say, "non fare il bambino". -Do you understand? -Yes. Okay. Juventus, huh? Maybe. Don't you have class? Yes. I'll be right there. Hi, Zlatan. Nice to see you here. Feel free to copy the blackboard. After that, we'll add to it, based on the subjects we'll study. We'll be talking about the soldiers... What are you looking at? Huh? Okay, boys! Pick it up! Faster feet, now! Footwork! Up all the way! Do you see who is standing over there watching? Roland Andersson. -Coach of the A-team. -Yeah, so? Is he making you nervous? Push, push, come on! Collect your guys! Yes, next one, next one! Turn, turn, turn! No, damn it! Come on now, guys! There we go, that's it. Come on! What do you want? Huh? What's your problem? And again! Yes! You should try passing sometimes. What, to you? We wouldn't last long if I did. Guys, listen up! Hey! Good practice today. But get this one thing into your skulls. You all play for the same team. You are all here because you are talented football players. Each one in his own way. That's nothing to talk about. But you play for the same team. The Under-19 Championships start soon. And if we don't play as a team there and work with each other... Then we don't belong there. -Got it? -Yes. -Got it?! -Yes! Good. One more thing before we're done. My bicycle was stolen yesterday. A brand new red city bike. So if anyone's seen anything or heard anything, come talk to me. -Okay? -Yes. Come on! You don't have a chance, Keki! I'm going to win now. Where did you find it? Stop it! One more time. No, I have to go. Practice a bit, I'll come back later. Come on! Last one. -Are you too chicken? -Yes, I am. Zlatan! Yes? Where are you going? Out with my friends. So how is school going? It's going well. Do you really go there dressed like that? Yeah. What's wrong with that? Girls want a little more class than that, you know? -Good luck! -Good luck, yourself! -Bye, Mom. -Wait, hold on! What's this? -Take it. -No, Mom. Take a little, come on. No, it's okay. -Okay. -Take it easy, my son. Which house deserves one? -That one. -That's the jackpot. Just hurry up. Don't mess around. Be fast, like on the pitch. Get in, get in! Drive, drive, drive! That was great! What a bang! Sh.t! Drive! Yeah, okay. Just because you ate doesn't mean you can't eat again. Says you, fatso. Says the guy who is practicing. He isn't eating anything. Look how skinny he is. You gotta eat, bro. He's pretending to practice. What are you looking at? Who have you made eye contact with? Well? She goes to my school. Yeah, I saw. You think I didn't notice? Who was it. Her, with the shirt. She's good looking. -You think? -Yeah. Go talk to her. Without 10 million in your account, you can't do a thing. The worst case scenario is a no. Okay. Hold this. Bro, good luck! That's all I can say. Hi, Lisa. Can we talk a minute? Yeah, okay. So, uh, I'm Zlatan. We go to the same school. Maybe you know who I am. Yeah, I've seen you. I wanted to ask if you wanted, to go out for a coffee some day, or something. Like on a date? Yeah, we can call it that... Yeah. Okay. -Are you sure? -Yeah. Yeah, okay. Cool. How about Gustav Square tomorrow at 7? Yeah. Okay. So, see you then. See you then. I'm going back to my friends now. You do that, and I'll go to mine. Dad? -Dad! -What? I need some new clothes. What? I need some new clothes. What clothes? Shirts and pants. I have tons of shirts. Pick one, huh? I don't mean those. I want new, I look like a hobo. There's no money for that. Your camp was expensive. Can't I have the student grant? Can't I get the student grant? Everyone else gets it. You want money. Money. Here, money. Go buy a shirt. Thanks a lot. Yes Here it is! Yes! Pass! Come on, right! -Pass! -Yes! Play the other edge! Come on, Zlatan. Look up! What should I do? You should look up so you can see that, Luka is wide open down there. Yes, yes! Coming from the left! Push, push! I'm open, I'm open! Nice! Get ready, guys! Yes! Coming from the back! Up again! Zlatan! Don't let that happen by the goal! Keep going, keep going. Good, Tony! Yes, yes, yes! What are you doing? Shut up! How is Johan? -Excuse me. -Mm-hm? I have a friend who injured his face and nose. But I don't know where to go. Okay, how about go ask for him in the emergency room. If you just follow the hallway and to the right, the emergency room is there. Thank you very much. You can follow me. Hi, Johan. So, I thought I'd come and check on how you're doing and stuff?. What do you think? My foot kind of hurts after your tackle. So is it serious? I think they said it was a fracture. So that's fine. I'll be back playing soon. Well...I'm sorry. What are you doing here? Relax. I came to check on the situation. You leave my son alone. Come on. Zlatan, come in here. Come on, Alex, pick it up! I spoke to Johan. He said that you apologized and that's good, but...damn! Your behavior is completely unacceptable. You hear me? You have to cut the crap. You have the build. You have the talent. You have the opportunity to do really well. You hear me? Yes. And I mean shape up overall: practice, food, sleep, school. Absolutely. Good. Nils-Åke... Your bike. I was the one who borrowed it for a bit. Well, god damn! -Are you joking? -What could I do? My brother was dying. I needed it. Your brother was dying? No, not quite dying. But I had to. It was an emergency. It was a one-time thing. You can get it back if you want. You bet your ass you'll give it back! Zlatan... We have one of the country's best academies. We have raised national players. Prytz, Schwarz, Bosse Larsson... You could become someone. But you have to want it. So what do you want? I want to be the best. Good! Better than that Bosse Prytz anyway. Make sure you show that, then. Okay? Absolutely. I'll fix it. No problem. -Tony! -What? -What are you doing? -Come on! We have to jump in now. Come on, come on, come on! Why didn't you show up? What do you mean? You were the one who didn't come. But... I was there. Were you there? I stood there waiting like an idiot. I was maybe seven minutes late. Maybe ten at most. I swear it. Come on. Maybe we can try again? I don't know. I have to check my calendar first. Forward, forward! Come on, Zlatan! Yes! Well done! Lovely! Good pass! Good game today, guys! What's going on? What's wrong with you? Well? What the hell is this? Who put this up? There's one thing you have to f.cking understand! I'm the only one who decides who gets to play on this team. Not you and especially not your parents. If anyone has a problem with that, they can come here to my office, and I will explain it again to them, personally. Is that clear? Is that clear?! Yes. Hey. Where have you been? I was out. You have to tell me when you go out. Yes, but you weren't at home. You should have called. You know the rules. -Rules? -Yes. What rules? My rules. House rules. What rules do you have?! Sitting in front of the TV, pitying yourself all day? Don't shout at your father, you ungrateful little sh.t! Why should I call and tell you what I do? You don't care about me! Who gives you food? Who is paying for all this? The fridge is empty! I have to eat at Mom's. Then go live with your mother if you don't like it here! To hell with you both! Get out! Hurry up! Shut up! Good luck this weekend. Make sure you win. Absolutely. Very good practice today, guys. Good to see you wanting it. And I want you to show that this weekend. Under-19 Championship finals in Jönköping. This is what we've been fighting for all season. And we're getting a win. There's no other option. -Got that? -Yes. The line-up is mostly the same as last game. Lucas on the left flank, Robban, right midfield. Simon at striker. Which means Andreas, Jimmy, Mehdi, and Zlatan start on the bench. -Why? -Why? Because we picked the eleven players who did best in practice. So pick me. Well, what you've done in practice... You're not at 100 per cent, so I don't know if you... What are you talking about? Huh? -Calm down. -Calm down? Listen, we'll talk later. Not now. You f.cking clown. You're only saying that because you don't want me on the team. -Hey, watch it. -Watch it? Do you or the fancy dads from Limhamn pick the team? That's enough! You shut your mouth and sit down. You start on the bench. End of story. And if you don't watch yourself now, you can spend all of next season on the bench. Got that? Sit down! Sit down! The bus to Jönköping leaves at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning. Go home. Eat well. Sleep. What is this? A hockey puck? Hush, or you do the cooking. Hello. Hello, Mom. -What's wrong with you? -Nothing. Why are you so skinny? I practice a lot. It's fine. Do you eat properly at your father's? It's okay. Here, Mom. Do you want some more? No, that's fine. Show me again. He should put you on the A team. You have the best tricks. Well, that doesn't matter. But why not? If you're from Rosengard, you have to be twice as good to get on the A team, otherwise they don't want to have you. What the hell is that bullsh.t? What the hell is wrong with you? What? Don't tell that sh.t to Keki. I'm just telling him like it is. Rosengard isn't the problem, Zlatan. It's you, butting heads on the pitch! Oh, please, what do you know? A lot more than you. ...a kick into goal. 1-0 for Hacken after 15 minutes of play. Free kick for Hacken. Patrik Karlsson after 27 minutes. A well-placed rebound. Peter Eriksson, new transfer from IFK Göteborg, with his second goal for the team. New Malmö Coach Roland Andersson doesn't get many chances at goal from Malmö FF. And today's defeat means that Malmö risks dropping out of the top league. Hey, what's happening? -Doing good? -Doing good. You? All good. Where are you heading? -Going home. -Home? We're going to wake up the whole town tonight. What do you think? Sick, right? I can't. I have to go home. What's up? Nothing. I have a game tomorrow. Did something happen? No. You sure? Yeah. You'd tell us if there was something? Of course. Take care. Take care. Drive. And that's it, ladies and gentlemen. The winner of the Swedish Under-19 Championship is Malmö FF. What the hell are you staring at? Really. I swear... Isn't that them? Drive, drive, drive. Come on! Stop somewhere. Come on! Hurry! Stop! Run, run! You always have to come to him, wherever he is, stupid motherf.cker. He thinks he is the Pope of China. Plus, he doesn't like me very much. Why not? It's not a long story. I once told him I was anti-Moggi. We have arrived. Merci. Hello. Welcome to the Hotel Riviera. Hi, we're here to meet Luciano Moggi of Juventus. Don't say a f.cking word unless he speaks to you, okay? Shouldn't you go freshen up or something? Okay, let's do this. Luciano... How are you? What the hell are you wearing? Are you here to look at me or to talk business? Luciano Moggi He looks like a clown. Cut the crap. What's this nonsense, having the meeting here? You should be rolling out the red carpet for me and my client. You're lucky they even let you in, Mister Anti-Moggi. Okay... We're not here to talk about me today. We're here to talk about Zlatan Ibrahimovic. People are talking about him, as you might have noticed. Does he speak? His feet speak for him. What is he saying? -He's a puppy. -You're wrong! He's a lion. That's why I brought him here. It's possible. But at the moment, he's not yet ready. He doesn't work next to Trézéguet. Who says that? Capello? Then I'll talk to Capello. You? No. You won't be speaking to Capello. I'm sorry. It's getting late. Let's go. You'll miss the biggest opportunity of your life. Hello? Did you hear me? You will regret this! What did he say? Huh? What happened? Mino I can't stay in Ajax. -You hear me? -Stop it. He doesn't think you're ready. -Want to go eat? -Can't. -Why not? -Got a game. -Now? -Yeah. My treat, come on! It's not that. -Are you sure? -Completely? -Yeah, I can't. -Completely. Zlatan! What's with you? I'm on the A team. I heard. Congratulations, man! It's insane! But they'll pick you up next time. I was on the bench at Under-19, and now I'll be going to the A team? I honestly don't care that much. Okay. Good luck in the game. Push harder! Don't let him turn it around! Don't hold the ball for too long! To him, to him, to him! -What's your deal? -What's yours? -It was 50-50! -No. Free kick from there. Walk away. -Hello! -Hello. How's it going? All good. You? You looked a little tired on the pitch. How are you doing? Tired? Is everything okay? Yeah, it's good. There's been some fuss, but it's fine. What are you looking at? Yeah, you. Dad, that's Nils-ake. -My coach. -I see, okay. Nils-ake, this is my Dad. Hello! My son. Good, right? Yeah, yeah. He has... He has a lot of talent. Yes, I know. Yes. Nice to meet you. I have to go. Bye! For you. -What's this? -Present. Good, right? The best. Thank you so much. Not a problem. Listen... Are you hungry? You bet. Should we go eat? What are we going to eat? Hamburgers, of course. Yeah, come. So what's the fuss? What's the problem? The usual. They don't think I fit in. Which "they"? All of them. The coach says I don't listen to him. Which you are supposed to do. Listen. You know Sapko? Your uncle. Huge talent. National Team. Boxing champ. He listened to his coach. He learned. But hwne they tried to clean him up...change him. He didn't listen. Do you understand? How nice for him. But you get it, right? Same thing for you. You should listen. But not listen. When they're shouting, saying that you're wrong, you should use that as fuel. You get it? Do you remember what Ali said before that match with Foreman? Do you remember? Well? Do you remember? I'm gonna dance, I'm gonna dance." "I'm gonna dance." Bravo. After the break, it's time for league play. In the second round, Ajax play at home against NAC Breda. With the transfer window closing in two weeks' time, there are a lot of rumors surrounding Ajax's talented players. Lots of talk about van der Vaart, but also Ibrahimovic. These days, he's a reliable shooter. But many are asking if the tall Swede is ready for Europe's best defenders. The competition in the top European leagues is hard and the question is: Does Ibrahimovic have what it takes? Zlatan! Ibrahimovic... Let's go!! Ibrahimovic! Goal! Well done, my son. Maradona, Zidane, and that list now includes Ibrahimovic. Zlatan. We need to talk. -Come along. -Now? Yes. Yes? Hello. Hello! Right. -Come in. -Hi, Roland. Have a seat. Relax. No one died. I promise. What? What are you talking about? Aw, just a little joke. How do you like the team, Zlatan? I like it. What about you? We're talking about you now. So what do you want to talk about? I think it's time you stopped playing with the little kids. What do you mean, "little kids" I didn't do anything to them. Welcome to the A team, Zlatan. A team? Are you kidding me? No! Congratulations! You start Monday. You'll get the contract and stuff like that from Hasse. Okay. So...see you. Indeed. And hey... Yes? No more stealing and crap like that. I stopped doing that crap in seventh grade. Keki! Keki? Pass the ball. You get 100 bucks, if you can take the ball from me. Maradona, Zidane, and that list now includes Ibrahimovic. I don't like to talk about myself because, I want other people to judge the way I'm playing. But what can I say? I'm 192, 93 kilos and I like to play football.
