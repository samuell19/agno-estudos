(KIDS LAUGHING) He's a stupid ass. Shit. Fuck you too, Lincoln. Talk about a punk. Yo, man, let's get the game started back up again. (STUDENTS CHATTERING) BOY: Yo, Brian! Wait up, man! BOY 1: He started it. BOY 2: You started it! I'm gonna slick your sister, spic! (SPEAKS SPANISH) Three thirty-two. All right, what's going on here? He started it. GIRL: Ooh, he's cute. BOY: We got a new kid. GIRL: Uh-oh. You in my seat, boy. (GIRL LAUGHING) You in my seat now. Damn. (ALL LAUGHING) Is this seat taken? Guess what? I'm in your seat? How'd you know that? Did I say something? Yeah, you said something. Get out of my seat, snow face. I don't think that I can do that. Oh, you don't think you can do that, huh? No. You see, I've grown real attached to this seat. In fact, I think we're gonna be going steady. (STUDENTS LAUGHING) Wow, that's funny. You're a comedian, huh? Leroy, take off that hat and sit down. Sit down or leave my class. (BELL RINGS) I catch you on the greasy side. Billy, would you please distribute these? Now, before you ladies get pregnant and you gentlemen murder one another, you will learn the joy of reading. This way you have something to do in your ninth month or in your jail cell. The short fiction of Mark Twain. Can anyone tell me what novels Mark Twain wrote? Belinda? Tom Sawyer Àand Huckleberry Finn. Yes, The AdventuresPof. American classics. And who knows Mark Twain's real name? Dawn? Samuel Clemens. Very good, Dawn. Yes, Leroy? Teach, why he gotta use another name? Why do you think? He wanted by the law. (LAUGHTER) No, it's a pseudonym, a made-up name. I got a pseudonym too."Spits." That's a nickname, Leroy. It has a meaning. And I hesitate to think how you got it. A pseudonym usually has no meaning. But this is an exception. Can anyone tell me what "Mark Twain" means? I thought not. It's a nautical expression used by riverboat captains on the Mississippi, used to tell how deep the river was. Right. Ooh. Rodeo scholar. Settle down. And who are you? It's on your desk, ma'am. "Transfer Tommy Riley." Well, Mr. Riley, welcome to paradise. (**) (INDISTINCT RAPPING) Hey, hombre. You got an extra smoke? Yeah, sure. Appreciate that. I do. Listen. How about one for after school? You want one for your girlfriend? I never refuse. Never refuse. How about your mom and dad? You okay, huh? I'll pay you back tomorrow. That's the dude. That's the one? Amigo, you carry a weapon? Hey. Hey. Well, he don't look like much. He not much. He's just a funny boy. Oh, yeah? Yeah.

Abraham Lincoln. Linc, here you go, man. I thought you was thrown out of school. Hey, this is public property. I got business to conduct. Gotta see how my storm troopers are faring. How are your avenging angels? Close to God, my brother. Awful close to the wrath of God. Yeah, I owe you, Lincoln. I owe you what you did to Jerome. Anytime, nigger. Anyplace. Well, then. Hello, time. Hello, place. BOY: Whoo-hoo! Yeah, Jerome use a razor too. All you storm troopers hide behind a razor? Why don't you step in the ring with me, bitch? Fight like a real man. You gonna bleed either way, partner! No, you gonna miss. Yeah, come on! Hey! Hey! Hey! LINCOLN: You crazy bitch! Come on! Break it up, you animals. Hey, hey, hey. Don't you drop me!

Your pops is John Riley? What about it? Well, we're friends of Big John's. Yeah, bowling buddies. Can we come in? Right. Thing is, we were supposed to rendezvous with Big John over in Bridgeport. Yeah, yesterday, but guess what. Somebody flew the coop. Sharkey got discombobulated. We had to cop the forwarding address off the postman. Nice. That's last week's, due yesterday. (MARKER SQUEAKING) And this week's installment. Due today. (MARKER SQUEAKING) You be sure and show pops my message, huh? I'll show him. (DOOR CLOSES) MAN: If I was younger and you was older-- Yeah, in your dreams, buddy. Oh. Hi. Hey. What are you doing here? Could I get a cup of coffee, please? MAN: Don't give me this bullshit about Murphy's Law. If I run into Murphy, I'm gonna kick him right in the balls. Detached retina? What the hell am I, an eye doctor? He's ducking the fight, that's what he's doing. I'll come right over. I'll see for myself. Right. Let's go. Assholes. I don't know why someone would live somewheres else, and then move here. Well, neither do I, but it does happen. No food? I'm a little short. I'll just take the coffee, thanks. Um, you're not interested in a job, are you? Uh, yeah. I could use one. Well, it's not much. It's the dishwasher. He didn't show up. I'm not proud. Well, um, I'll ask my mom. Okay. (DISH SHATTERS) That's free. Next dish'll cost you a buck and a half. Glasses are 75, cups are a dollar. Yes, ma'am. (TOP SLAMS) You can empty the garbage now. Take a five-minute break. He went outside. Goddamn, man! Ain't he cute? He's beautiful, man. Throw a couple of earrings on his ear, bits of rouge on the cheeks. He'll have all the little white boys chasing after him. I got no quarrel with you guys. I'm sure you don't. What's the matter? You lose your dress? Come on, let's have it. What you gonna do? My brother's 5 years old, he doesn't fall for this, Jack! You know what I'm saying? Want a piece? Come on, come on. Taste the real thing. Hey, hey, Shortcut! What the fuck is going on? He tried to hurt my boy. You're fighting tomorrow night. What happens if you get hurt? Ain't no way this funny boy gonna hurt me. Mr. Horn has got big money bet on you. He finds out you're street fighting, you're off the circuit. Your ass is in a sling. Shortcut fight, Mr. Jack. See, that's what I do, boy. I fight. This ain't over, punk. Hey, hey, hey! How come I haven't seen you around here before? (DOOR CLOSES) MR. JACK:ÀNobody's asking you to win. Just get in the goddamn ring with him! Listen, you run out on this, you better keep on running. Horn's gonna be chomping on your ass. Same to you, dick breath! Well, fuck you too! (DIAL TONE) Excuse me. Can I ask you something? Can I join you? It's a free country. Whoa. Would that were true, kid. Would that were true. The name is Jack, Pappy Jack. And I can be the best goddamn pappy you ever had. I already got one. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. You threw a hell of a punch out there. Tell me. Do you fight? Do you box? Golden Gloves, over in Bridgeport. Did you win? Yeah. It was like five, six bouts. You want something else? Apple pie? I don't know. Maybe-- Maybe later. How about you? A little privacy, please? Thank you. Thank you very much. We have these amateur bouts every Friday night. Some smokers. Nothing special, fancy-schmantzy. But there's a lot of bucks involved. You fight a few rounds for me tomorrow night, I'll make it worth your while. How much worth my while? Oh, now we're talking. Now we're doing business. $750 bucks worth your while. You'd pay me $750 to fight tomorrow night? What is there, a fucking echo in here? Who do I fight? A guy named... Black Death. But don't worry. He's not a fatal disease. And anyway, you got the antidote. There's a lot of tough kids around here. They don't have the right... complexion. I lost my white kid. My back's on the wall. No, thanks. No, thanks? Hey, how many dishes do you have to wash for $750 bucks? About 30,528. Thirty-thousand five-- So, what are you? An idiot? I need 1250 bucks. You're negotiating with me? That's what I need to clear up a few debts, that's all. I don't wanna hear any hard luck stories. Do you wanna fight or don't you? Don't get a hard-on! Are we negotiating or aren't we? Okay. I like you. I like the way you handle yourself. We're gonna do it your way. Twelve-hundred fifty bucks. (CHUCKLING) (DOOR CLOSES) Dad? MAN: Tommy. Tommy? Tommy? Tommy, wake up. I got some great news. Hey, Dad. You know that job I've been telling you about? I got it. Starting today I'm on the Phillip's payroll. That's great. Yeah, that's great. The bad part is, I gotta be in Elgin at 10:00, and after that I gotta go out on the road for the next month. A month? Selling medical supplies. I learn the territory, then they bring me back. I work full-time in Chicago. And we can get out of this slum, and we can get our lives back together. But the deal is, you're gonna be alone for a month. You think you can handle that? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. How's the new school? It's okay. What's wrong, Tommy? Well, these guys showed up. One of them had a gun. Did they threaten you? No. Come here, son. Sit down. Listen, Tommy. Uh, you know... I know I wasn't any help to you when your mother died. You know, I guess I was drinking a lot and I lost the job and I was dumb enough to think that, uh, I could win big money playing cards and pay the hospital bills. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to bring you into all of this. But you know, if we hadn't wound up in this dump, maybe I would've never woken up. I'm awake now. And I'm not drinking, and I'm not gambling and I'm not feeling sorry for myself, and I got this job. And these guys-- These guys are gonna get paid. They're gonna get their money. Sharkey? John Riley. If you and your goons ever bother my kid again, I'm gonna kill you. Yeah, I don't care. I mean it! You will get your goddamn cash, Sharkey. (SIGHS) I'll see you soon. Okay. Okay. You take care. (DOOR CLOSES) MAN: Keep moving there. Keep moving. Hey, pal. Yeah, move the car. Yo, kid. Where you going? I'm supposed to fight. Tommy Riley? Hey, Linc, look who's here. Why don't you come with me. MAN: Come on, park it. Let's go, kid. Okay, let's close it up. Hey, kid. I thought you were a no-show. I'm on time. Oh, say, sure you're on time. It's not you, it's me. I think everybody's a no-show until they show. This here's your corner man, you're all-around man. How you doing? Hi. Try these. What are these, six-ounce gloves? Are these even legal? Legal? I gotta tell you, kid. It ain't mairzy doats and dozy doats out there. It's war. You fight Black Death like the marquis of Queensbury, and you're gonna be carried out in a body bag. But, hey, good luck. (DISTANT CHEERING) So, what's your name? They call me Noah. Only I ain't got no damn ark. I ain't even got a rowboat. All I got are a broke nose and a bunch of recollections. You got recollections, boy? Yeah, some. Ah, you young yet. They accumulate. Believe me. You grow up southside? No. Bridgeport. Bridgeport? You're moving in the wrong direction, son. Yeah, well, it's just temporary. (LOUD CHEERING) I got another boy to look to. I'll be back to get you when it's time. (CHEERING) * Will it be another blonde Redhead or brunette? * * What did I have last week? I tend to forget * Hey, hombre. You on the circuit now? No. Just tonight. Mind if I join you? Not at all. Say, don't you know nothing? Circulate that blood, man. Gotta tap dance before you tap dance. If you know what I mean. I'm just trying to get my bearings. Move with me, man. You go in that ring cold, you gonna come out cold too. Name's Essadro. Romano Essadro. Tommy Riley. You Irish, huh? Yeah, so? Hey, hombre, Àain't no accusation. It's just a-- a what-cha-ma-call-it-- Ethnicity. Yeah, like me. I'm Cuban, but I never seen the island paradise. Who you fighting, anyways? Some guy named Black Death. You been fighting a lot somewheres else? Uh, not a lot. Listen. You stay clear of his right hand, you hear? Come here. Come on. Come on. Put your left hand up. Circle right. Good. Circle right. Circle right. Good. That's good. It's time to get paid! That's right. Hammer time, brother! (LAUGHTER) Shit, man. I could've had you. Hit your fucking head off.

All right, now touch gloves and come out fighting. Fifty on the red and 70 on the line. That's the elbow! Get up, kid! Come on, get up! (CHEERING AND BOOING) All right, keep fighting. All right! Who's the brawler? He's got a punch. That's all I know. Ain't you getting tired, punk? Can't you hit me once? Stick him, kid! Come on! Whoa, whoa. (CHEERING AND BOOING) One, two, three, four-- Oh, no. That's it. That's it. He's finished. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight-- All right! Hit him! Yeah! Kill him! Kill the guy! (BELL DINGS) Hey, hey! Get him, Bridgeport! (DINGING) All right, kid! Where did you find this kid? I'm telling you, on the street. He just walked in. Leo, give me a Crunch. I might lose my investment. You're doing all right, kid. You're doing all right! What the hell are you doing? You're looking like a bum! Now, he's telegraphing his punches. When he gets set with the right, he drops the left, and you stick him. Repeat it back to me. He drops the left, I stick him. That's right, kid. Okay, kid! Go on, get him! Stay with him, okay? Just hang in there. (BELL DINGS) Now! MAN: All right! (WILD CHEERING) Jesus Christ! Holy-- Look at this kid. Oh, my God! (CHEERING) You are a natural, kid! You got firepower, real firepower! ANNOUNCER: The winner is Tommy Riley! He's mine! He's mine! You got the balls of a lion, kid. You got him! He's mine! Mine! (CHEERING) PAPPY JACK: What do you think? He's gonna be just fine. How you feel, kid? Feels good, doesn't it? Good! So where's my money? Kid, don't worry about it. You're gonna get your money. Mr. Horn wants to pay you personally. Who's Mr. Horn? He is the power and the glory. Yeah, he's the power-- right now. He's the reason that you got in the ring tonight. No, he's not. (CHEERING) Oh, goddamn it. I gotta go. You come by the gym Monday afternoon, you get your money and we talk some more. You're fucking beautiful. Beautiful! Talk about what? Great. Thanks a lot. Oh, you earned it. Keep working. Mr. Riley. What door did you walk into? Maybe he bumped into a pseudonym. All right, that's enough. (BELL RINGS) Go to your seats. Hey. Hey, how you doing, Romano? Feeling no pain. I win too. Hey, Lincoln. Hey, what's up? Did you meet my friend, Tommy Riley? You mean the great white hope? Not me, man. No? Well, what was that Friday night, a ghost? Let me tell you something. Some ghost look just like you wasted Black Death. That's Lincoln. (**) You, uh, looking for something, chief? Pappy Jack. In his office. All right. From Horn. And this one's from me. Say hello to Mike. (KNOCKING) Hey, kid! Be right there. (GRUNTING) HORN: Here's a hold. He comes in. Just knock his timing. With the elbow, right? Then bing, bang. End of story. All right? You got it. Pay attention, will you? You gotta give him something to shoot at, right? He comes into the body, hook it, just for a second. Just a second, and bang, right cross. I find the way you fight terribly exciting. Oh, I'm just trying to get out of there alive. Aren't we all, my dear? Hey, kid! Ooh, you like M&M peanuts, huh? HORN: Jesus Christ, don't muscle in! That's Mr. Horn. Listen up. You might learn something. You think it's all about strength, but it's not. You think it's all speed. It's not! It's strategy! You gotta find your opponent's weakness, and then you exploit it. Now listen to me. Youth is a tool, all right? It's a good tool, but it's only one of the tools. There's also knowledge. There's focus, strategy. You think you can whup my ass? What do you think? I'm tired of thinking, motherfucker. Oh, shit! Watch. He's playing possum. Mr. Horn and Mr. Good Chocolate. Best fucking finishers I ever saw. All right? See? Huh? Strategy. Yep. Well, you got more of a show than you bargained for, huh? You still got it. Yeah. Oh, I feel better already. You got something on your lip there. It's very sexy. Give him a week's rest. Put him in against Lincoln. He's got too much weight for Lincoln. Put him in with Lincoln. And bet the farm against him. He ain't got it upstairs. Tommy Riley. Hello. Are you the boy I've been waiting for? No. Pappy Jack, take good care of this boy. Give him whatever he wants. What do you want, Tommy? I just want the money that you owe me. Go ahead. Well, of course that. On top of that, what? That's all I want. How refreshing. Everyone else I meet has their hand out. You know, Tommy, I should be upset with you. Why? You cost me my investment. What's that mean? It means Black Death is damaged goods, kid. So now I'm invested in you, huh? How would you like to fight for me, Tommy? I appreciate the offer, Mr. Horn, but I'm not interested. Come on, kid. If it's a matter of money... No, no. You know, it's not the money. It's just that I don't wanna end up without a brain. Don't be stupid, kid. Mr. Horn is giving you a terrific shot here. Hey, hey, hey. Tommy, I respect your decision. Been a real pleasure meeting you. Likewise, I guess. Good luck to you. Get him. Hey, Tommy. Hey, Romano. I got you something. I was buying some new duds, I thought: "Hey, my amigo needs a little style." You like it, or what? Yeah. I'm-- This is my first hat. You look sharp, man. How about me, huh? Real sharp, Romano. Yeah, you gotta be a-- You gotta be a real perverse individual to pass up this kind of money. It's got a bad smell. Hey, maybe it don't give off the best odor in the world, but it sure smells better than any of my other chances. Once I save some, I'm gonna do what I promised my old man. I'm gonna ship his body back to Romano, Cuba. That's where he was born and how come I got my name. Then you'll quit, right? You crazy, man? Then I'm gonna get a real apartment. A stereo, TV, VCR. Gonna buy a waterbed. I like you, Romano. You take care of yourself, huh? Just because you quit, hombre. Hey, Sharkey. Pappy Jack. You still with me when I make my move? Listen, you son of a bitch, there's a couple of your collectors down here. Mm-hmm. All right. (PAPPY JACK CHUCKLES) Yeah. Soda? I didn't think you'd be at work last night. Why not? Well, why would a person wash dishes when they can make all that money boxing? I'm not boxing anymore. That was a one-shot deal. I can't figure you out. Neither can I. (HORN HONKS) PAPPY JACK: Hey, Tommy! (HORN HONKS) How are you doing, kid? I'm doing. Mr. Horn wants to see you. Yeah, well, I'm busy right now. Sweetheart, I know half a dozen ways to make a guy get into an automobile. Bye, Tommy. I'm just telling you one thing, kid. I found you. I brought you in. Don't you forget that. Come on in, kid. All right, give him a call. Tell him I'm not happy. Keep an eye on it for me. Let me know what he says. Like those pictures? Gladiators, Tommy. They fought with their bare hands. Fifty, 100 rounds. Next day they go back to work in the foundry. They were tough. Tough in body, tough in mind. And they understood about strategy. When you're weak, you act strong. And when you're strong, pretend to be weak. Care for some champagne? Uh, no. I don't drink. Why did you wanna see me? I was hoping you had a chance to think things over. Come aboard, Tommy. Three grand a fight. That is very generous of you, sir, but-- PAPPY JACK: Kid, money is talking. Well, maybe it's not talking to me. Tommy. Sit down. Come on, sit down. Relax. Look, why don't we be straight with each other, huh? I can't afford to let you go. I'm my own man, Mr. Horn. Nobody is his own man. Not from the day we're born. Everybody owes... somebody something. Who do you owe? Me? Who do I owe? Uh... God. Huh. Don't we all? Amen. But some of us... Some of us owe, uh... Jack, show him. Here you go. Read them and weep. Take a look at the signatures. Those are markers. Your father's markers. Your father has managed to accumulate gambling debts somewhere in the neighborhood of $15,000. That's an expensive neighborhood to be in. There's evil people in this world, Tommy. Nasty people, like Sharkey. And your old man is giving him a song and a dance about waiting a few weeks and giving him 50 percent. Jesus Christ almighty, Sharkey's gonna give him a pair of concrete boots and throw him in the fucking river. So I did your old man a favor. I did you a favor. I bought the debts. Those debts are mine now. Do you understand? And what's mine is yours. Hmm? Okay. Okay. Come on. Hey! Look! Well, well, look who's next. Leave him alone! Sure, after we carve our initials in his butt. Get him! Run, hotshot! Come on! Move! Move! (SQUEAKING) TOMMY: Rats. Don't worry, though. Ain't the human kind. Damn it! Don't worry about it. We'll find them. I don't know what's worse. Getting skinned by Shortcut or owing some white boy. You don't owe me. How come you do it? Save my ass? I don't know. See somebody in trouble, you know. Hey. I've been in trouble since the day I was born. And no white boy come to my rescue. Well, maybe there were no white boys around. You could say that again. Poverty's a black disease. Not just. No? I hear you wanna be a college boy. You think I'm going to college? You could. I got one chance. One chance for my baby, and that's this right here. These. What do you mean, your baby? That's my lady. Laura Lee. She just turned 16. And that's Cecilia. They're beautiful, both of them. I call the baby Black Beauty. That's her nickname. (DISTANT CHEERING) (CHEERING) Not many fighters like Lincoln can give this much weight. (GRUNTING) REFEREE: One, two, three, four, five, six! He can't do that! Who's to stop him? One, two, three, four, five, six, Gonna ruin him. seven, eight, nine-- (CHEERING) The harder they fall, hmm? (CROWD CHANTING) Lincoln! Lincoln! Lincoln! How much do you think we made? A bundle. TOMMY:ÀSo tell me about Horn. NOAH: Oh, lord. Mr. Horn was supposed to be the light heavyweight champion of the world, but God give him one bad foot. They operate. It don't work. Try it again. Same thing. By the time he's ready to fight again, it's too late. He's lost too many years. But he's smart. He sees more money upstairs, and a lot less danger to boot. Has anybody ever beat him? Before his foot go, he lost one fight. I remember. He come back, rematch. He punished that man. Retired him for life. Nope. He ain't got no weaknesses. That's not what Horn says. What do you mean, son? Well, he says that everybody's got a weakness. Well, I'm looking, son. I am looking. * Aay-ohh *Aay-ohh * I'm ready * I know I got the power * (KNOCKING) * Aay-ohh I'm ready * All right, all right, I'm coming. * I know I got the power * Hey. Um, I was just-- Come on in. Where you been, Tommy? People are asking. You're not at school or Millie's. Yeah, I know. Well... Miss Higgins asked me to give you this. You really applying to junior college? Also, your paper on Mark Twain. Miss Higgins read it in class. She says you're full of promise. Yeah, that's me. Full of promise. It's nothing to make fun of. Well, I don't have time for school right now. I got to fight. You told me you weren't fighting anymore. Well, I guess that was a lie, because I got to fight four more times. Nobody has to fight. No? No. Be honest about it. You want the money, right? But it's illegal, Tommy. I know, but if I don't fight, Horn'll kill him. But how do you know your dad won't keep gambling? I can see it. It's in his eyes. He's kind of like he was before my mom died. When did she...? Oh, about a year ago. The big "C." I'm sorry. That's when I started boxing. Punch the feelings out, I guess. Well, this is my house. Good deal. I have to go. Dawn. Mom's waiting at the diner. I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't realize the time. Bye. See you at school. Left, and a jab. You got to flick it. Flick it. Yeah, I'm gonna get you, Snow White. And tomorrow night I'm gonna get you, spic, just for being his friend. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Don't be talking that Spanish shit-- What was that? I told him to go fuck a goat. Good. Yoo-hoo. I owed you that. See you later, amigo.

Fighter's stance. No, no, you see, you're fighting head on, eye to eye. That is not the way. Like this. To an angle. That's right. Fighting is not hitting. Any fool can hit. Fighting is making the other fella miss. He miss, he think, he worry. It's a mind game, huh? I know a fella once, he won a fight with one arm. One arm! His spirit told him to win, his mind showed him how and his body delivered. (CHEERING) I'm gonna kill that motherfucker. Ah! Goddamn it. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. Stick and move. Stick and move. He called me a spic. So what? You are! Give it to me. Give it to me! Come on. That's it. Go ahead. Hey, fix my hair. What's the matter with you? Concentrate on this fight.

Just bodies. They carried him out of the ring, he was unconscious. Oh, yeah. I sent that one to the hospital. What hospital? Horn makes the arrangements. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to complete this exam. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? Hey, kid. Hey, Dad. How you doing? Uh, Charlie Landman says I could sell ice to Eskimos. In a blizzard. That's what he says. That's great, Dad. So you got the old touch back, huh? Yeah, everything's rolling right along. How about you? How's things in school? It's good. Yeah? Nothing's wrong? Those goons ever show up and bother you again? No, they never came back. Tommy? No, no, I'm fine. Really. So when are you coming home? Uh, well, I'm not gonna be back for another couple of weeks. Mm-kay. I, uh, I put a check in the mail for you. Yeah, I got it. Thanks. Okay, good, well... You take care then, okay? All right, well, you take care too. Bye-bye. All right, bye. MISS HIGGINS: Mr. Riley. Mr. Riley? Would you mind joining the rest of the class? (BELL RINGS) Papers on my desk! Can you stay a moment, Mr. Riley? You, uh, haven't been to school for a few days. Can you tell me what's going on? I'm sorry. I can't. That's too bad. You have a gift for language, Mr. Riley, but talent is a common thing. People waste it every day. They abuse it, they take it for granted. Success comes not from what God has given you, but what you do with it. It's really up to you. Well, thanks. Are you okay? Romano's in the hospital. Really bad? I think so. I'll see you at the diner. Okay? Oh, Tommy. Um-- My mom hired a new dishwasher. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow? Romano Essadro. Is he a patient there? Essadro. E-S-S-A-D-R-O. All right. Thank you. If I was you, I'd start looking at the county hospital for the poor and indigent. Down the hall, to your left. Hey, Romano? Hey, Romano, it's Tommy Riley. (WHISPERING) Hey, hombre. It's no use to knock at that door. Doc say he in a gang war. Bastards leave him brain-dead. Hey, Romano? Hey, Romano, wake up. Buddy, wake up. Wake up! All right, I've given you guys your instructions. I want a nice, clean fight. Now shake hands. How's Romano? Is he dead yet? I mean, he dead, ain't he? Listen! Listen to me! You're angry. That's what's gonna get you beat out there. Anger is your enemy. It's like I told you. It's a mind game. Outthink him! And then get in there and outfight him. Okay? Hmm? Okay. That's all right. I ain't gonna wait. Give it to me now. Come on. (BELL RINGS) How's your new girlfriend, huh? How's Dawn? I'll have to get me a little bit of that. That's it! Hit him! Hit him! PAPPY JACK: All right! Drop him! Drop him! Come on, finish him! Put his lights out! Oh, I think we may have our boy! HORN: Come on! Hit him! Hit him! Finish him! Finish him! What, are you working on a merit badge? (CROWD CHANTING) Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Hey, my man. You're something else. Hey, hotshot. This is the white boy I told you saved my black ass. Appreciate that, because I love his ass. And that's my Black Beauty. Say, "Hi." You want a lift? Okay. What's up? You want to hold her? Mmm... Shit, Linc, you gotta teach that child to hate white folks, man. Hey, Tidbits. This is a pretty sweet car, Lincoln. Yeah, well, Horn's renting it. What he calls one of my perks, on account of I'm his "numero-uno Negro." Yeah, well, Horn's a real scumbag. What, you just now realize that? The whole world's crammed full of them, my brother. Thanks. Hey there, hi. TIDBITS: He leaked. Oh, my G-- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Hey, don't worry about it. See, that's holy water. You baptized now. * In every man * A fear is born * He must stand * Within the storm And wake the faith * All right. Thanks for the ride. * That sleeps so deep Within the heart * * In the darkest hour * We face the past I knew you were fighting Shortcut tonight. * As thunder rolls * Across our path * A sign of hope * Oh, when you reached out For my hand * * You can always Count on me * * Wherever you go * Is where I'll be * Call me In your hour of need * * I'll carry you home * 'Cause I believe * You can count on me * Yeah Jack Dempsey, Rocky Marciano, Barney Ross. You know what I mean? No. Come on, kid. Billy Conn? Carmine Basillio? Slapsey Maxie Rosenbloom? Micks, wops, kikes. Those are the guys who used to fight in the old days. Tough white guys. Just like you. And they got a need, just like you. What the fuck do white kids need today, a haircut? Money to buy their own cars so they don't have to borrow daddy's keys? MAN: Let's go, Lincoln. Think about it. Linc! All right, that's enough. Hey, Linc. You all right? Yeah. (WHISPERS) You all right? I'm okay, I'm okay. All right. Yeah. I'm okay. Just look at my finger. He wasn't hit that hard. He was last week... when he got kicked in the head by that heavyweight. Same thing happened to a friend of mine, Choo-choo Charlie. What? Didn't lay off like he was supposed to. End up paralyzed. What's the matter with him, doc? Ah, could be nothing. Could be a bleed. "Bleed"? A blood vessel in his head. It's not serious, though, if he rests. I'm recommending a 60-day layoff. How you doing? Hey. No drama, hotshot. Sixty days. Comes with the territory. (BELL RINGS) This kid is gonna do it. You put money on him... WOMAN: Where are they sitting? (CHATTERING CONTINUES) What's Enrico doing in the ring with Tiny Tim? What the hell do you think? Trying to knock him on his ass, I guess. I'm supposed to fight Enrico. You were, but, uh, we found a last-minute replacement. Going for the jackpot. Mr. Horn's offering 20 G's to the winner. No time for charity, kid. Go for it. I knew this was coming, ghost. Hey, no hard feelings, huh? You don't wanna make your face look like Burger King. I thought you were gonna take some time off. Yeah, well, Horn persuaded me otherwise. You know, see, I win this, he's taking me pro. Madison Square Garden. I won't do it. I ain't gonna fight you! What do you want me to do? I got no choice, ghost. This is my ticket. Right here. Don't mess with that. If you my friend, don't fuck with my life. Lincoln's got a bleed. He could die if he gets hit hard. Know how many times I've heard that nonsense about bleeds? Know how many times I've personally seen it disproved? Your own doctor said Lincoln needs 60 days' rest. That sawbones? We fired him. Look, if it was up to the medical profession, there wouldn't even be any boxing. I'm not fighting Lincoln. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. You're gonna fight Lincoln, you're gonna beat him, and I'm gonna make a lot of money because Lincoln's a big favorite out there. And after you've beaten Lincoln, you and I'll have a little chat about your future. You understand? Fuck you. What, are these guys gonna kill me? I certainly hope not. You see, Tommy, you're the boy I been looking for. Don't you know what you can be? I'm talking welterweight champ. I'm talking 2 million bucks in your pocket when you fight for the title. The broads love you. The people love you. Everywhere you go, people say: "How are you, champ? We love you, champ. We're with you, champ." You could have a high-rise on the moon, kid. I'm trying to concentrate. Yeah. Be careful, huh? All right, if Lincoln loses there's gonna be a fucking riot in here, so get him out fast. Leo, let's go-- Hey! What have we here? How are you, beautiful? Come on. Let's go see the action. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Sharp. Sharp. the fight you've been waiting for: The main event of the evening.

I think you'd better look. We feel like fighting now? (BELL RINGS) You going try and beat me on my body? Beat you on the body, the head goes down with it. Yeah, but you ain't good enough. Hit him! Hit him in the head! Use the left! Sock him! Get out of there! Get out of there! Break! Break! Get up. Get up, you punk! One. Two. Three-- If I lose, Horn's gonna hurt my girlfriend. But I'm still not gonna hit you in the head. You're gonna have to kill me. One. Two-- Are you gonna kill me? Huh? Horn wants us to kill each other. For what? So he can get rich? Fight! (CROWD BOOING) One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six-- Put them up! Come get your money. Go on and do it. Lincoln! If you're gonna do it, do it now! Lincoln, take him down. Take him down now. Lincoln! Damn you. Damn you to hell. To hell with you all! Where the hell do you think you're going? Get over there and kick his ass. No. No? You don't say no to me, boy. No. I'm not fighting for you no more. (CROWD GASPS) Come on, let's help him. MAN: Make some room. (HORN CLEARS THROAT ON P.A.) Ladies and gentlemen, the management wishes to apologize for the fiasco that you've just observed. That's not a fight! I want my money back! Can't do it. Your wagers and your admission fee will be refunded. Thank you. Horn! It's all right. I want you. What? I want to fight you, right here, right now. What? Well, what's in it for me, huh? What have you got that I could possibly want? Me. I get it. Ah. You fight me, you win, and you're free. Is that it, huh? You and your old man? Okay. But if I win-- When I win, you fucking little punk, you belong to me. Do you understand? You're mine. Deal.

Look at that face. Look at that face. Come on. Come on. Hit hard. Hey, you're gonna need that, aren't you? Come on, take a shot. Here it is, right there. Go ahead.

Hey, I'm over here. Hey, what's under here? (CROWD CHEERING, LAUGHING) Aaah! God, he hurt his hand! That's why they invented boxing gloves. Stay away, kid! Move! Say good night, kid. Where you gonna go now? You better try something. That ain't gonna do it. Come on! That ain't good enough. Break! Break! Break! Come on, go to sleep. Go to sleep. That's it.
