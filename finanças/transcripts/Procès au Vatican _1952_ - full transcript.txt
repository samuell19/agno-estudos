Several years have gone by Marie to has entered the Carmelite order she has become Sister Marie of the Sacred Heart the visiting room which before was a source of tribulation to Torres is now one of her greatest joys. We were both of us on the same date you to pronounce your vows as my first communion. It must have a significance. I think thinking about you this morning. What have you given to Jesus have already offered during my two months of preparation 3700 acts of love and sacrifice more than 50 a day if God is not able to count it means someone else was doing it.

Since Christmas. I've changed I'm not the same girl. There's a saying I feel I must be lie. Never was fun. So if you're loving more than so repenting, I'm sure that I'm able to save sinners and make God love more than he has ever been. I shall not try to keep you from him. It is an honor.

Rome Rome Yes Since we have to go there. I will see the pope he will listen to me I surrender come on even if I have to walk through flames. Remember you must proceed in silence, it is absolutely forbidden to speak to His Holiness. To speak what's your advice? Holy Father, I would like to ask you something. Please permit me in honor of your Jubilee to enter Carmel under each type of bed you to say Do you know who this child is? I do your holiness. The superiors are now examining her request. Well, my dear child, you must do as the superiors decide. Oh Holy Father, if you said yes, they would accept me. You will end to Carmel if God wills it guys God willed it? Well my Reverend mother's You may now sing that today as delegate to the bishop I present you this 15 year old child whose admission you've allowed I shall pray that she lives up to your expectations let me remind you that if she doesn't you alone will bear the responsibility I should stay here forever we should help you with your things, sister. Please don't come in. We're not here to resume family life What do you think of the new one? Oh much too young. Not very strong. Two models were enough the three that's too much. Please, Sister sister Elizabeth, would you be so kind as to take a blanket to the sale of sister Teresa, the infant Jesus. You're not taking it yourself. You should be happy to get your little sister back. Sister Teresa herself pointed out that we no longer back home and we say anyway. She is visiting our mother priorities never forget that you entered Carmel to live your life in imitation of our Lord Jesus Christ. You must love yourself he is there have a presence. Remember, it is not enough simply to respect the silence. You should seek it is silence that brings peace and comfort. Since He who lives in solitude has no other enemy, but himself. Yes, Reverend matter. Is it true that you know the whole Imitation of Christ by heart? Yes, I do mother. Very well recite for me one of the chapters. The love of Jesus above all Are things Blessed is he who understand is that he must love Jesus and he must despise himself for Jesus sake you must renounce all that you love it for this beloved for Jesus will be loved above all other things that must one day be separated for more whether they will do it or will not good I see what will not be necessary to remind you the words with large delegate do gracias Sister Mary of the angels I placed in your hands on new postulant and outstanding nature oh yes outstanding proud to don't be discouraged you must work without shrinking from even the most menial tasks all roads lead to God especially the most humble mother Genevieve center as the founders of our community she's an angel get audit done just blame the CI close to being swept by a child to disgrace after recreation remove that cobweb be more careful in the Teacher Yes Reverend Mother didn't know say she'd be good for nothing? Genevieve is begging you to go speak it is difficult in the beginning. If things are too hard, come to see me once in a while. How can I ever thank you my good mother. Certain of our sisters appear to be imperfect. They are the novices are those systems who are suffering from some painful malady. I'm beginning to realize mother that a sister whisk there's more to accomplishing part of her duty than a sister sound in body and mind who accomplishes all well I'm pleased to say that you understood my child. I entered here without any illusions mother. I shall expect nothing but from God. I know that my car will be my way of the Cross. Please follow me I'll show you to the kitchen oh the ducks the ducks veto take him away sister I haven't the courage please forgive me it seems to me that you're not giving your prayer all the concentration required it is especially regrettable since it's been reported to me that you've been boasting on several occasions of wanting to be a saint. Is that correct? Yes Reverend Mother such presumption confine yourself to not offending God temper your desires with humility that Reverend Mother I do not find such desires in temporary because our Lord told us to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect. Do you think it's enough merely to do what you have to do to become a saint? It would be too easy our Lord as more of his children go now and do penance. We getting Are you happy? Are you sure you were Yes, a little one. Though it isn't the season I would wish everything to be white or covered with snow Knowing. What are you asking for? I am asking for God's mercy, the poverty of the order and the company of the sisters. Have you come here of your own accord and of your own free will to receive the habit of this order? I have your lordship Do you wish to enter this order or the love and fear of our Lord? I do with the grace of God and the prayers of the sisters you know money batteries it really it's spirit to solve bla bla says Dirac your father is very ill they take him to the hospital Bolsover at camp. Oh my god. I'm afraid to tell the news to Tyus What a blow this will be to her. Yes. Yesterday she was saying I don't understand saints who don't love their parents? Anyone can see that you have more goodwill in you than strength and you sister Sandy Are you especially lack indulgence. Will you give him permission to break the silence? What's going on? Please Forgive me mother for 16 days is just happier has been browbeating me go back to your cell mother with your permission I'll do what I can to help sister Thank you. Good. Too much too young. To hold a person You're much too clumsy Have you heard this a cousin of sister Therese has been married to Dr. Lanier Why yes, everyone's talking about it. Well then sister tears to is getting married. Here's the announcement she's component and announcement. God almighty, creator of heaven and earth, sovereign and spiritual ruler of the world, and the glorious Virgin Mary, Queen of the Heavenly Court, hereby announce the spiritual marriage of their noble Son, Jesus, Lord of lords, and King of kings with a maiden Tara's master hints for I assisted to raise the infant Jesus, make my profession and promise of chastity. Poverty and obedience to God our Lord to the Blessed Virgin and to you mother price Oh, yes, over sister. Yes. That was tough for me. And perhaps tonight. I believe it's in heaven. Do class Oh, Mother, I'm so sorry that you weren't with me when I took my veil. My heart was there. I've been watching you for a long time now. At this moment I'm taking the place of God by your side. And I can assure you to raise that is very pleased with you. You have learned to master I'm to bear many painful experiences. It is you who have consoled me, Mother, You who have been suffering for seven years? Not for seven years. Since it's been over 40 years. Yes. But nobody would have suspected. Nobody. If I had not fainted that night in front of you. How you must have suffered much, much more and much less than when imagined. Conspicuous wounds are more embarrassing than painful. I mean thing just is to be at peace with oneself. I have always been at peace with myself in life. I've said this everything is simple. It's enough to want to the us the assurance that God is only messy that the yoke of the Lord is gentle and his bird is light with peace and joy Amen. All right. God is the God. I've just caught the last drop of a cent after mother Genovese death Teressa Sister Pauline is elected prioress It was to be expected. Our new Primus has given a difficult task to her sister. Just think, instructing novices at her rate Sister Mary It is not for you to pass judgment on our new priors. Her choices of sister tourists was dictated by no other motive than the welfare of the community. Everything seems to be perfect. Like the candles, and make sure that the flowers are in place. Go and get our mother prior also today with no more matches let me show you you see sisters just a small lamp hardly a light produced all these flames and these will in turn light and infinity of others and illuminate perhaps the home each of us resembles that insignificant light I'm glad you're here Dr. Bell is no longer necessary to announce a visitor. Oh no doctor. There are only three healthy sisters left in common. sister Sophia is much weaker this epidemic is getting worse than ever. I haven't been able to get any sleep in two days Thank you Sister sister sent peers dead. Where is this the mouth of Jesus she must come to help us out go kart deer grass sister Elizabeth needs your help in the infirmary. While you're burning with fever sister to raise Please don't bother about my sister. Go to the fabric sister Teresa's mother Maria Gonzalez may need my help. One of the essential rules of our community is that we must never show preference for one or the other of our companions sister to raise our mother. I'd prefer to be censured or even expelled from the convent rather than failing my duty. Now go quickly to the infirmary. Sister Teresa, yes, I understand you're in charge of the novices. It's about Sister Marie Madeleine. I think she's been overdoing it. Look. This iron cross she's been wearing has brought on a very serious infection. I feel it my duty to warn you about this. Doctor, would you please give that cross to our mother prioress? She shall judge why have you hidden your suffering from me? Who wanted you to wear that Iron Cross? Our Mother Mary have gone sack. One side to war that small cross when I first became a nun But I gave it up long ago. The great penances were not meant for us Are you having trouble with your novices sister there is a time for us to take by the skin and others by the tips of their wings here's what that to the Kanye gave me during his last visit. Is it true sister Teresa that you've been raising protest against certain modifications that I advise sister Madeline to perform? Yes, Reverend Mother Hochul were the greatest saints modified themselves. I believe that if God had really willed it, Sister Mary Magdalene would not have been sick for so little. I pity all those who are here who refuse to battle against the flesh. Spiritual conduct seems to be much more important, on pretext of mortification, one commit successes which are injurious to one's health, and interfere with the performance of one's duty, what difference they contribute to our salvation. They do often lead to a desire to gratify oneself. Ours is a life of death matter. We mustn't do anything which might either preoccupy our minds or keep us from reaching God that you're trying to do sister tourists to question the principles of our Mother Teresa of Avila to behave like a revolutionary to reform Carmel to listen to God, if also was called to perfection, at first before entering heaven to apply these methylations our Lord would have told us and we would have been fitted them upon ourselves. But he told us that there are many mansions in his father's house. If there's one for the great there must be one for his smaller children are places there who were sister tourists that are saints were afraid to incur damnation. Tell me why you haven't that fear. Small children cannot incur damnation. God only comes with obedience. To give you one example among others, you still persist in asking for communion every day. We have our law sister tourists and they are written for eternity during my lifetime Mother, you may force me to respect the laws but after I am gone, I will make you change your mind. Several months Torres undergoes a terrible spiritual trial but she bears it for the sake of her unbelieving brethren. That she will bring back to the faith many non believers graces you will see my little mother I obeyed your wish I'm writing my childhood memories but tonight you're in doubt you are before a wall which is hiding hip Am I still certain that there really is a heaven? Look at St. Paul. See how much you wondered? Before finding the road to Damascus? Yes. But to withstand such an attack against faith ones be a real matter. Isn't it too much verse more so like mine? No, you have said it yourself. The reward for perfect faith is not success it is trial your dream of light, you hope one day to emerge from the mists wherein you are languishing. Forward forward, rejoice in the death which will give you not what you hope for, but a still deeper night, the night of everlasting nothingness. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. You compare yourself to God? What have you done with refuse the life he gave you? You wish to be a saint and you struggle in the darkness. I give you my peace. Abide in my love to reach him What do you bring him save your empty hands. You are weak week has been. In this living body which is the church robber head, the limbs, the eyes and the hands are those who think those who were those who heal and those who spread the word. But the centers for the better gifts and I show unto you are yet more excellent way, a way of channeling. The church is a living body. She has a head and members that she has a heart. A heart that suffers a heart that loves the heart that spread light throughout the whole body. My vocation I have finally found it. My vocation is love. I haven't lost found my place and that place Oh my god it is you who gave it to me. In the heart of the church my mother I shall be loved. And I shall be one day a generous donor since rather unusual gift to come out. Don't touch it please system looks like the devil himself. Let me handle this. It's not at all surprising that he should resist. He's the only one here who hasn't made available obedience. John mother priors. Take this to the kitchen and have a stew made of it. Oh, sister Tevez. My sister to raise you know more consider my advice than my solicitude. You must be frozen on No. On the contrary, I've never felt the warmth if it continued snowing I begin again every day who wants to keep on washing and who prefers coming with me to prepare the ornaments on the altar? So to do is we'd all prefer helping you with the altar things. What shall we do? It shouldn't be so difficult to decide what it costs you to wash in cold water is what it costs the others therefore do it by taking the humblest places we practice mortification for ourselves and charity towards others. In the meantime mother Marie of Gonzaga is again elected prioress. It's probably slight chills to tourists. However, if because of this illness, you wish to receive dispensation from the Lenten fasting you may no matter I shall finish the Lenten season as I began it your seat see I placed it on Hanoi you perhaps know why. But sister to raise it will be weeks before you arrive there a month and a half. Maybe even longer sister today's father who lives here the missionary who was leaving for China? Yes. Using the visiting room. Sister Teresa, the infant Jesus. Yes, brother. I bless your mother prioress for having chosen for me, a spiritual sister who money right. Our mother is very kind. Your letters will be a great consolation. Consolation. I was hoping to be transferred to Hanoi. You've come to tell me that they refused my request. I know that your mother has very great need of you here. She thought above all that the scabbard was not as sturdy as the blade and that it would be thrown overboard before reaching China. It's really not convenient to have a soul and also a body you won't have the less apart system Yes, I know you will be a missionary of action and I am missionary of love was just a test your hacker just covered with blood he who I'm awaiting is arriving it's not very frightening. On the contrary I will go and tell my mother price no I beg you not to say a word how mother knows the time not well, if she hasn't seen for the physician then it is the will of God sister you were wrong in hiding from your condition. Why are you worried my little Mother God only sent me this heavy crust that the moment I was able to bear it before it might have been a source of discouragement however today I mentioned is entirely pacified my mother priors has sent for doctor to koinonia you will be cured if God wills it and I am not sure he is willing but it's not important for it is his will that I love I commit myself to God. Temperatures do very high continue the investigation and the hot needles. The poor child back is completely so it must be done. Of course she must not under any circumstances leave the infirmary is it serious doctor? I know you're very brave. There isn't much hope now. She has enough for those who haven't been. I saw this coming long ago. There's nothing I can do. To Tereza the infant Jesus is no more of this world you have so much courage to say no no, I haven't enough courage. I'm like a soldier hearing compliments on his bravery and realizing all the while he's just a coward finally becomes ashamed of his confidence and would like to learn I was gonna try to rest in case you need me don't hesitate to send for me yours sister Therese I would like to ask you a question. A delicate one. If I don't much more wish to die than to live. I let Almighty God choose for me. Anyway, I don't know what more I should have in heaven. And then I have now I would see God it's true but as for being with God with him on Earth sisters or beg of you know fatiguing sister to raise since they're always disturbing you I wonder how you're able to put two sentences together well I'm writing on charity it's the moment to give proof of it charity for all is all there is on earth We love God in the measure that we practice it What's that music it's the village Why don't you rest sister just two more lines two lines I promise. I gathered this he got us you I have nothing better to offer I can see from your eyes what you're thinking other than they are right in getting us to keep them Lord. Do you really believe that if you're a little rest be taken away. It is I I think that we took care of her a bit too late. No, you're wrong, Reverend Mother. For seven years I've said nothing. But today it's my duty to justify my conduct. Do you remember? I was the first one to uphold against the whole world. Her admission to Carmel but at the very first day I realized one could not treat like a child was sold that color. I know I was severe. I never spared her at all. I also humiliated her voluntarily admitted. But without that, would she be a bit of st today to attain that in she needed help from no one He is above watching I was only the instrument of our Lord's will. In that case Mother You have no further need of consolation. God was judged you have nothing to fear mother he will have judged today as before you I'd always hoped that the weather would be nice on the day of my death Do not weep sisters like those who live without hope until now my humblest prayers have been answered and so the biggest to die a death of love will be answered as well how was it your able system just stay so calm to remain so afraid and maybe afraid of death Yes, but one mustn't fear what comes after you will look down on us won't you know I should descend closer to my sisters I feel that my mission is just beginning my mission is to give my little way to save souls if my desires are granted my heaven will take place here on earth till the end of the world I will I will spend my heaven in doing good here on earth Oh Reverend I realized all that I owe you Yeah, everybody's failing me. When will I breathe the air of Heaven Never will I knew how to die prepare me to die a good death. My dear child, you are prepared to appear if you have understood the virtue of humility. Yes, I've only been searching for the truth. Yes, I have understood humility of the heart and that the kingdom of heaven is within all of us. Right I never thought that it was possible I'm only able to explain it by the ardent desire that I have to save soon and it was you who said we must leave that to him Jesus our Savior died of love and you know how great was his agony look stars I wish sure of it all my wishes have been granted bless your sisters she will understand she knows what it is to suffer as I do time of the singing of birds is come now come hither my beloved one my little arise for winter is passed all consuming it is love alone love my god I love the oh my god, Sister Teresa. Everyone Nothing is finished. All is just beginning no objection could be raised to be innumerable proofs that Torres had kept her promise to spend her heaven in doing good on her. On May 17 1925, Pope Pius the 11th canonized as Saint Torres of the infant Jesus. Childhood prophecy has come through already patron saint of missions, Torres was designated second patron saint of France, on an equal footing with Joan of Arc. Nevertheless, the greatest saint of modern times will always be to each other's little terms
