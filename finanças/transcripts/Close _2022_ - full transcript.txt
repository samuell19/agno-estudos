But it's not that important. Imagine you're a very small duckling. You just came out of your shell. You've just opened your eyes for the very first time. All the ducks are yellow. And so are you, but you're much more beautiful than the others. You're special. One day, you decide to leave, and you encounter a gecko. You're wondering what it is, as you've never seen one before. You think that this gecko is wacko. And it rhymes too. But you like it. Because its color is special, just like you. One day, you leave together. And you end up on a trampoline. You start jumping on the trampoline. You jump as high as the stars. It looks a little bit like this.

Why do you say that? -COURTNEY: Because it's clear. -What is clear? COURTNEY: That you're a couple... Do we hold hands, do we smooch? No. I could tell you the same because you do girly things together. -My girlfriend! -It's not that. It's just... When you sit next to each other, you're that close. Of course, we're best friends. GIRL: We're best friends too. It's just a question. COURTNEY: I think they're really best friends. Yeah, we're BFFs to the point that we're almost brothers. COURTNEY: It goes beyond that. GIULIA: They've known each other forever. COURTNEY: Maybe you don't accept it. Not at all. Could you stop now? We're just not together. -CALYPSO: Are you sure? -Yes, I am! GIULIA: Okay.

You had to do a lot of things at once. You had to make sure the plants were still there and so forth. It was fine after that. SOPHIE: Hmm? It becomes easier when... -SOPHIE: You get used to it. -Yes. That's the trick. You do that all together? That's nice. -How's school? -It's all right. And the teachers? Some are good, others are super boring. You don't say. That's always the case. Forget about the boring ones, and focus on the good ones. More water? Don't hesitate. Then I would have to pee. You could go. You're familiar with the house. If you wanna pee, it's no big deal. Did you come to see me? Yes. Can I go to his room? If you want something, help yourself. No, it's okay. You see, I looked everywhere. Leo? What happened between you two? I have to go.
