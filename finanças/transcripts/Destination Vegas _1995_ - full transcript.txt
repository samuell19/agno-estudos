(ominous music) (phone ringing) - [Donald] Hello? - [Missy] Donald, it's Missy. - [Donald] Oh, hi. - [Missy] Look, Donald, I'm not sure, but I think I've uncovered something. I think that Richard and Mario have something to do with the death of Chico Hernandez. Can you get the story into your paper? - [Donald] Don't say anymore on the phone. - [Missy] Can you come around tonight? - [Donald] I'll be there. - [Missy] Great, thank you. Okay, I'll see you then. - [Man] That's all she wrote. - Did your hear that, Graham? Jesus Christ! Thank you, look, do you mind stepping outside for a moment, please? Did you hear that, Graham, do you know what this means? Well, do you? - [Graham] She doesn't know what's she talking about. - Jesus! - I don't even-- - It was on your recommendation that we bring her in as a board member. I don't think that Haroldsons would be very happy with us if they knew what was going on. - They'd fire us immediately. Now that can't be allowed to happen. You understand that? - Of course, not. - Good. - So, what steps are you gonna take to stop it from happening? - I'll talk to her, I'll bring her around. Okay, just don't worry. - We do worry, Graham. We worry about you, Mario and I, we worry about, you worry us, Graham. You really worry us. - [Mario] You see, Haroldsons is not an account that we intend to lose, especially not because of some stupid little bitch who can't take the heat. - The rainforests are inhabited by a number of pressure groups who will be against the plan. However, and this is the important part gentlemen, South American law is a lot less stringent and you can avoid any compensation suits by filing for an appeal which can take up to five years to go through the courts. - [Mario] How can we be partners with somebody who couldn't take a hard decision when it mattered, you know? - [Richard] You've gotta be committed to Wright Lombardo because when Arturo Viola signs those contracts in Vegas we stand to pick up all the rest of Haroldsons legal affairs, in total. - [Graham] Anything she does is totally on her own. I'm completely committed to this company. - Prove it. - [Graham] How? - Well. (Mario laughs) Kill her. (echoing) (knocking) - Hi. - Hi. - Did you have any trouble finding the place? - No problem. - Good, come in. (dramatic classical music) Can I get you something to drink? - Sure. - Red wine okay? - That's fine. - Great. You're never gonna believe this. I was in Richard's office tonight and I found something I think you need to see. (knocking) - I'll get it. - [Missy] It's probably Kathy. She's a writer, too. (guns firing) (thudding) - [Kurt] Hey, you sure she's here? (crashing) - Oh, God. (glass crunching) (grunting) (door banging) (tires screeching) (guns firing) (fast rock music) (sighing) (ominous music) - [Driver] Where you headed? - Vegas. (slow country music) - So, you borrow your daddy's car for the weekend? - Yeah, ran out of gas. - Nice car. - Yeah. What kind of a gun is this? - It's a 12 gauge pump-action shotgun. (laughs) - I hope it's not loaded. - Oh, it's loaded. Yeah, when you need firepower, you need firepower. You know what I'm saying? That's why all this talk about banning assault rifles really pisses me off! (gun clicking) - Shut the fuck up and get out! (country music) (door opening) (slow country music) - Say one word and I'll blow your dick off. Get in, drive! - So what are you, huh, a carjacker? Kidnapper? A robber? You're a murderer! - Attorney. - (laughs) Jesus Christ! This ain't what I'd classify as no regular attorney procedure. - [Missy] No, it isn't. - Are you scared of me? I asked you a question! - Just shut up and drive! - Something wrong with the vehicle that you pulled up in? - Yeah, I can't drive and hide at the same time. - Well, I didn't plan to be on no road trip at gunpoint. - Listen, two guys are trying to kill me, okay? - I don't blame them, I'd wanna kill you myself! - Just shut up and keep driving! - Look, you ain't no badass. I ain't never seen no badass with no shoulder pads! I know where you're coming from and I ain't scared of you! (gun cocking) - Listen, you don't know what I am. (gun firing) (glass shattering) - Shit! - Get down! (gun firing) - Would you point that thing at them, not me? - Put both hands on the wheel. (tires screeching) Don't take your hands off the wheel! - I told you not to point that thing at me! Would you shoot them? - Put your hands on the wheel! Look, I don't care if I shoot you, so don't push me, okay? - Well, excuse me. (gun firing) (tires screeching) What the hell did you do to these guys, huh? - Nothing, okay? (dramatic music) - Come on, baby! Shit! - What? - End of the line. - Out! (tense music) (guns firing) (shotgun booming) (grunting) (groaning) - They're gone, I don't see 'em. (coughing) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. - Oh, Jesus. - You alright? - No, I'm fucking not okay. - [Kurt] Come on. (dramatic music) - No keys. (engine sputtering) (guns firing) (bullets pinging) Scoot over! (engine revving) - What was it you did to their car? - Took me the coil wire. - Oh, good. - Now what's a woman with legs like yours working at some hotshot law firm, huh? - My hotshot law firm's trying to kill me. (guns firing) Morning, Carol. - Dan Wisecroft's coming in at 11 a.m. Feinstein and Gerber filed an appeal against Vectracon. Your dentist canceled and Haroldsons are waiting for you in the board room. - They're here already? (sighing) Okay? - Go get 'em, champ. (dramatic music) - [Missy] Don't get up, gentlemen. - Mike, Adam, I'd like you to meet Missy. Missy will be handling the contracts, closing stipulations and federal requirements. Oh, and Graham would like to go over a few aspects of the land tenure agreement. Graham? - Thank you, Richard. In a land acquisition deal of such substantial size, there's naturally a large number of competing parties whose undocumented claims to ownership of the land date back for hundreds of years. There are also a number of native Indian pressure groups trying to bring world attention to their plight. (scoffs) So, we've drawn up a counteroffer which we feel plays down any negative connotations associated with purchasing the land. And at the same time, raises the public's perceptions of Haroldsons, which, as everyone in this room knows, is not too good. But, by using the government's own conservation tax break schemes, we can avoid all negative media by purchasing the land for conservation purposes. - So, if I understand you correctly, you're saying that we can actually acquire the land legally if we say it's for conservation. - You got it. - With government backing? - You got it. - What about if we change the land use, say at a later date? - That's no problem. Like a chain, any contract is only as good as its weakest link. And we found a weak link, we found a loophole. (whispering) For the first year, you don't even so much as break a twig. You leave the area completely untouched. At the end of the year a government inspector shows up. He sees the land is protected, he goes away, fills out a report. That, gentlemen, is the last visit he will ever make. (laughing) - Well, gentlemen, that's about it. Mike, Mario, you got anything to add? - Yeah, let's go get a drink. - [Richard] Nice job, Missy, thank you. - Counselor. - Perfect. - Excellent. - Thank you, Mike. (men chattering) - [Mario] Hey Richard, he oughta get a company car out of this one. Been talking about it the last hour. - Yes! (sighing) - [Missy] So when did you come up with that conservation loophole, hotshot? - Just something Richard and I have been dreaming up. - Bending the rules again? - As far as I can. - Well, I thought at least Richard had a bit more morality. - (laughs) Richard's not stupid enough to let his morality interfere with a two and a half million dollar account. Besides, it's my morality that makes you hot for me. - Let's get this clear, Graham. I am not hot for you and if I hear you say that phrase one more time, I will slap you with a suit for sexual harassment so fast it's gonna make your preppy little balls spin. - I booked a table for us at Molina's, 8:30. Don't be late, I have a surprise for you. - [Texas] I reckon you saved us back there. - Not all attorneys are assholes. - Where'd you learn to shoot like that, huh? - My dad, he wanted a boy. - Well, maybe I shoulda had you as my attorney. Texas. Texas O'Shaughnessy, that's me. Best car thief in the southwestern United States, I guarantee. - Missy. - [Texas] Missy. That would be a southern name. - Afraid so. - [Daniel] Okay, gentlemen, get out of the car. - [Kurt] Let's go, come on, get out. Move it! (gun firing) (car rattling) (clearing throat) - Can't you read? We're outta gas. - Um, yeah, we need a repair. - I'm on my lunch break. Try Barstow, 40 miles east of here. (gun cocking) - Lunchtime's over. Move it you fat fuck! - Don't shoot! I'm sorry, we get some real scumbags in here. - Yeah, great defense testimony, now fix the car! Graham, it's Missy, are you there? Pick up! (voicemail beeping) I'm at a gas station, I'm on my way to Vegas. Look, I don't have time to explain now, but Jesus just get out of your apartment, okay? Just get out right now! (ominous music) (phone ringing) - Yeah? Did they say which gas station? Okay, we got 'em. They are in range. (machine beeping) - Ooh, you can run, but you can't hide. - Police department. Yeah, hello, there's two guys, they're trying to kill me. They're armed. On the I-80, or the I-15 somewhere, a gas station in Barstow, near Barstow. No, I don't, no, it's not a domestic dispute. An hour, okay. The radiator's bust, fix it. - [Station Owner] I gave the mechanic the day off. - [Missy] Goddamn it, fix it! - I'm right on it! - You wearing cologne? - What are you talking about? - I don't know, something stinks. - Here, hey look, it's probably this. You goofy... - Is that your boyfriend? Gray-ham? Is he a lawyer, too? - Yeah. - I don't see him. He ain't here in your time of need. - Yeah, well I left in a hurry. - Now what sort of a man would leave a woman like you at a time like this when there's bad guys chasing her, trying to cut her up, put bullet holes in her? I don't know this guy, but there's one thing for sure. I already don't like him. I told you not to point that thing at me. - Yeah, well, I don't always do what I'm told to do. - Well, neither do I. If you was my girlfriend I'd have shot those assholes long ago because I'd have cared enough for you to kill for you. And if he don't feel that way about you, now what sort of a relationship you got, huh? It ain't love. That's for sure. - I never said it was. - Bang! (guns firing) (chattering) - Got anything to drink? - Vodka's in the fridge. - Oh, that's all you got? - Oh, is that too strong for you? - Why don't we make it a double? - Ooh, okay. (seductive music) - Nice place you got here. - [Missy] Thanks. - [Graham] How long you been here? - Oh, a couple years, I guess. - Here's to Wright Lombardo's newest partner. - Most attractive partner. - I'll drink to that. - Well, you'd better. - Although Richard does have nicer legs. - Hey! - Watch it, you might not get your present. - Present? (gasping) Oh my, God. - You like it? - I love it, yeah, it's beautiful. - [Graham] Go ahead, open it. - (laughs) Just what I've always wanted. Put it on. - Very nice. Looks good from here. - You think so? - Yeah. (moaning) - [Missy] Oh, yeah. (moaning) Oh, yeah. - It's them. - How you doing there, buddy? Go ahead, check the car. - Me? - Yes, you. Come on. Tell me something, buddy. You got any idea what happened to the folks driving that green car over there? (mumbling) Wait a minute, wait a minute. - (yells) No, they're still here somewhere! - Damn, yeah, ah, ah, ah... (groaning) Okay, thank you very much, buddy. - They're not there. - Let's check around back. (music tinkling) - They're not here. (sprinkling) - I hate the desert. Come on, come on, come on, come on! (tires screeching) - [Kurt] Damn it! - God, I'm gettin' slow! (sighing) Fix it, come on. - You ever been in a stolen car before? - No. - You ever broke the law? - Yeah, once. I got caught stealing a plastic Santa Claus off some old lady's front yard. I was 12. - Well, I started stealing cars when I was 12. - Well, you must be very skilled at this by now. - Yeah. (guns firing) - I'm gonna be in the board room if you need me, Carol. - Oh, you can't it's in use. - By who? - Richard, Mario and Graham. - They're having a board meeting without me? - I don't know, something about Las Vegas. Richard had me shred all his faxes. - [Donald] Well, you know what they want the land for, of course? - Yeah, a real estate investment. - Hamburgers. - Oh, I don't think so. - Have you ever been to the Amazon? There's nothing there. Real estate doesn't have any value at all. It's just miles and miles of dense rainforest which is of no use until it's been deforested. (machine beeping) (tense music) - To remove the threat from rainforest activist Chico Hernandez. This will be in the best interest of the project. Oh God, it's them. - Don't shoot till you see the color of their eyes. Otherwise you'll never hit 'em. - [Missy] God, you sound like a pro. - I am. - Go faster, they're catching us! - This is faster! (tires screeching) - Don't get so close! (gun firing) (bullets pinging) - [Texas] Hang on, sister! (crashing) (screaming) - [Missy] Oh, God, Jesus! - Just sit down. (yelling) (tires screeching) (tearing) - This is gonna sound kind of silly, but do you mind if I touch your legs? My wife had nice legs. - Just drive. - Why? Because she's got a shotgun. Because she's got some little cowboy helping her. Because we're in the middle of nowhere. I can't get a goddamn glass of water. Well, okay, I didn't bargain for this shit. It's gonna cost you more. What's that? No, no, no, wait a sec, I'll tell you what. No, listen, I'll tell you what. What you do is very simple. You come out here and you do it, because I'm done. That's right, I'm fucking done! 10 grand. $10,000 dollars, yes. - So why don't you believe me, then? Yes, I did hold him at gunpoint, but only so he'd fix the car for me. I would love to give myself up. But if I sit around here waiting for your boys to show up and arrest me, I'm gonna be dead first. - [Graham Voicemail] This is Graham, leave a message after the beep and have a great day. - You're still talking to your lover boy? - He's out. - How do you know this guy, huh? - We work together. - I don't believe you. You and him work together, yet y'all still get along. Goddamn amazing. (laughs) Gonna get in the car or what? Or you gonna stand there all day looking pretty? (whooping) - So why haven't you run away from me yet, Texas? You've had plenty of chances. - I figured I had a little time on my hands. - Well, you know, they're probably gonna kill you, too. - We're all gonna die some day. When it's your turn to die, you'll die. - They seem to think it's my time now. I don't wanna go. - Well then, I guess it's not your time. - [Missy] So, Texas, are you what they call a career criminal? - [Texas] Professional get away car driver, actually. - What do you do if they're following you? - Park. - Park? - Soon as you get around the corner you pull a 180 slide, park and you get down. - And that works? - Mostly. - So, what if it doesn't? - You hit the gas and drive like fuck! (laughs) (tire blowing and flapping) I guess it's our lucky day. Got an extra spare. (engine revving) - So what are you doing driving in the middle of the Mojave desert, anyway? - Just got out of the Nevada state correctional facility two days ago. Four years for firearm felony. - For what? - Armed robbery. I was the driver. Only thing was, they didn't get me on that. My fuckhead brother comes and visits me and brings his 45 automatic. Starts showing it off to my wife, Tammy, ex-wife. Cops come by with a warrant for my arrest. They know I'm the driver only they can't prove nothing. They find my brother's gun, he's got no license, and I go away for four years for firearm possession. - Why didn't you appeal? - Couldn't afford a decent attorney. - I'd have taken you on a no-win, no-fee basis. - Ease your middle class guilt. - Oh, shit! What is the whole thing about middle class guilt, huh? (dramatic music) (beeping) So, did your brother make it up to you? - Yeah, he made it up by running away with Tammy. - Where were you headed when? - Reno. - [Missy] Are you gambling? - Murder. Kill my brother. - Your wife, too? - No, she's just like some stray cat. No, she'll move in with whoever feed her. - I used to think Graham was like that. I don't know. I think he really cares about me. - Really? - Yeah. He gave me this. - People wonder why we can't compete with the Japanese. - What? - Detroit's finest piece of shit is overheating. - Jesus. - [Missy] Shit, here they come! - Come on, baby, come on. Come on, sweetheart, let's go. Come on, come on, come on, damn it! - Gimme the gun. Don't you trust me? - [Missy] It's not loaded. I can't find anymore cartridges. - Alright, come on, come on, come on. Let's go, let's get out, let's get out. (coughing) (guns firing) (bullets pinging) (panting) - [Texas] Come on, get in! - Damn it! (yelling) - [Missy] This is what they're after. (coughing) - What is it? - It's account records for the last month. You know, bank details. - What exactly are you talking about? - That guy, Chico Hernandez? He was murdered last month and this shows that there was a payment made to a bank in Puerto Vallarta, exactly where everything happened. - Chico Hernandez, I heard about that guy, read about him in the paper. - In jail? (siren blaring) - Yeah, we read, you know. - Yeah. - Yeah, he was like the leader, all the tribesmen could trust him. - And he was assassinated. - By who? - Haroldsons. - I'll never eat their hamburger again. - No, this is serious! - I am being serious! Look, I don't wanna melt the polar ice caps for the sake of some cheap hamburger! (siren blaring) - [Missy] Just pull over, Tex, and don't say anything. No weird stuff, okay? - What's the matter, don't you trust me? - Just please, let me handle this. I've gotta get to Vegas. - Why you headed there? - To stop a contract signing, just shh. (tense music) Hi, hi, officer. - License and registration. - Um, he's helping me. I'm the lady that called earlier, you know, from the gas station? I was really frantic. There's these two guys they're trying to kill me and... - This cop gives me the creeps. - Shh. - I'm gonna have to write you up for a cracked windshield. (gun firing) (screaming) (shotgun booming) - [Texas] You'd better drive. - [Missy] Oh, my God, we're cop killers now. - [Texas] He ain't no cop. (groaning) - Is it serious? - No, it just hurts like a son of a bitch. - Maybe we should take you to a hospital, huh? Suppose you hit an artery or something? - No, if it was an artery there'd be blood pumping all over the place. The main thing is we gotta get you back, I'll be alright. Look, your boyfriend Graham has betrayed you, I hope you know that. - Oh, he has not! - Look, you call him and minutes later these chumps are chasing us trying to kill us. You got cops chasing us! Alright, he's working against you! - Look, just because they keep finding us doesn't mean it's Graham! - Somebody is helping them trying to find you. These guys are pros, they'll be back. Professional hit men, amateur human beings. - You don't know him. What, what are you, what are? - [Texas] Goddamn, they got you bugged better than the White House. - Oh, Jesus! - Now, what'd you do that for? You're supposed to plant it on some other vehicle so's you can confuse them. Now, don't you watch any TV? - [Kurt] She killed him. She killed Vinny. - Oh, Lord. She's really beginning to annoy me now. - Should we stop? - And do what, give him mouth to mouth? (beeping) - Hey, they're really close. - [Daniel] I don't see her. - No, look, look, look. I can almost smell her. - Well, can you almost see her? (beeping fast) - Right here, stop, stop! We're on it, we're on it! - What? - They're here, look! - Where? Look, do you see her? (sighing) - They found it. - What? You said this was gonna be easy. You can't even kill a woman, for Christ's sake? Look, I've got a contract signing in three hours. She simply cannot be around. I don't care. If this blows up and the cops get involved I'm gonna say anything, anything. Am I making myself clear? (thumping) - Let's hole up, let the engine cool down. - That little bitch is really beginning to tick me off. - My hand's still throbbing. Fuck! - Well, that is your own fault. Now, isn't it? I don't know how the hell you let her get away with that one. - Yeah, I noticed you had everything under control. - Shut your mouth, Kurt! - Come here, let me do something about that shoulder. (tearing) Okay. - He gotta be insane to want you out of his life. (breathing heavily) (harmonica music) (car door slamming) (ominous music) - Hey, kids! Can you hear me? Oh, I bet you can. I'm listening. (dramatic music) - Where to? - You go that way. (gun firing) - Let's split up. (gun firing) (bullets pinging) - Drop the gun, you piece of shit. - Oh, hello, beautiful. Oh, Kurt, there's a terrific looking woman standing here holding a very large gun on me. I don't wanna kill you. I got an idea. I got, I think, a terrific idea. I think it's a very good idea. - Shut the fuck up! - Here's what we do. You see, what you do is you pay me a little bit more than they were gonna pay me to kill you and then I will just walk away. I'm gone, by golly, I am gone out of your life! Hey, I know you're good for it. Right? You'd pay me, wouldn't you? - Drop the fucking gun! - You pull that trigger and you are a killer. And that is not a very pleasant thing to be in the middle of the night, let me tell you. Hey, I don't wanna kill you. You seem like a nice person, you're a beautiful girl. You have two options, my dear. You can either kill me or you can let us both go. What do you say? Come on, my babe. Come on, honey. Drop the gun, put the gun down. Come on, honey, put the gun down, down, down, babe, come on. (gun firing) (groaning) (thudding) - You forgot the third option. - You think you're pretty funny? - Uh-huh. - [Missy] Texas! (punching) (Daniel groaning) - [Kurt] Shut up and get in! (gun firing) - How far are we from Vegas? - About a hundred miles. Destination Vegas. (elevator dinging) (laughing) - Gentlemen. How are you, Mike? Adam? - How you doing, Graham? - You have a nice trip? - Oh, it was great. - I was just looking for you. Arturo's here, he's eager to put ink to paper and I'd like to go over those answers I gave you. There's some bleeding heart journalist wants to take another stab at you guys. (laughs) - Excuse me, but isn't Missy gonna be joining us? - No, she can't make it today. Shall we go to the conference room? - Look, guys, Mario and I would like to have a word with Graham before we leave you in his capable hands, alright? - Of course. - Be right back, gentlemen. - Graham. Graham, look, well? - Well, what? - I hope I'm wrong thinking there's a problem? - They haven't done it yet. - What? - There's been some difficulties, but it's being taken care of now, as we speak. - Any fuck ups and you'll be giving us more than just your resignation, you understand? (laughs) - Hey, would you please take it easy? Every time you hit a rut you're killing my leg here. - Okay, okay, don't worry, Danny boy, I'll take care of you. - Don't you call me Danny! - Alright Daniel, okay. I'll take it easy, alright? I promise. Alright? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay, Daniel. - Okay, you just take it easy, okay? - You got my word on it. - You take it easy, then. Ow! I'm gonna tear out her heart and I'm gonna shove it up her ass! (groaning) - We don't get a bonus for torture, man. - You just do this for the money, don't you? You don't appreciate the craft in any way? No honor, no dignity? - Load up, they're back. - We don't have anything to load. - Then fasten your seat belts. - They're gonna die. - Hang on! (tires screeching) - Look, I'm gonna tell you one more time. Take it easy! (crashing) Ow, Jesus Christ! (dramatic music) This is your fault! (crashing) Would you watch out? Turn the wheel, turn it this way, turn the wheel! Turn the fucking wheel! - [Kurt] I am! - No, the other way, turn the fucking wheel the other way! (crashing) - You think they're dead? - Maybe. - Daniel, are you okay? - [Daniel] I'm gonna kill you! - They don't sound dead to me. - No. - It's your fault! Everything, all of this is your fault! Fuck! - Oh, God. - Always dragging us behind, lagging behind you fucking pain in the ass! - Oh, gasoline, come on, there's gasoline. - Fuck it, come here, get up. - Let's get out of here. (exploding) (fire crackling) (tribal music) (slot machines dinging) (cameras clicking) - We finally get to meet. - Yes, nice to meet you. - Have you met my assistant yet? - Bless you, sir. - Bless you. - Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen of the press. Thank you for coming. You're here today to witness the signing of one of the most unique real estate contracts the world has ever known. - [Female Announcer] Biggest payout on slots, 98%. - We're all acutely aware of the present global warming situation and also the need for industrialized nations to join together to do something to arrest the current trend toward ecological damage being done to our planet. It is in this spirit that Haroldsons has chosen to become the very first major U.S. company to acquire land in the rainforest of South America. - [Female Announcer] Keno, roulette, black jack, now playing. Lobster and steak dinner only $2.99. - Now this is a revolutionary approach toward conservation which will yield immediate benefits, not only for Mother Earth, but also for the peoples of the rainforest who have struggled so long, so valiantly, to protect their land from deforestation. - [Female Announcer] $1.99 all you can eat buffet. (horn beeping) - [Missy] Come on, get out! - And so I am very proud to introduce to you a man who has traveled all the way from Puerto Vallarta to be with us today. The Minister of Trade and also Foreign Affairs, Senor Arturo Viola. (audience clapping) (panting) - [Female Announcer] Keno, roulette, black jack. Biggest payout on slots, 98%. - [Missy] They killed him! They killed Chico Hernandez! I have the proof, it's right here! - She doesn't know what she's talking about. - [Missy] They did it! - Son of a-- - [Graham] Security, get her out of here! - I have the proof here in my hand! (echoing) I have the proof, they're murderers! All of them! - Get her out of here! - They killed him! They killed him! - Call security, please. - What's going on here? - I have the proof, it's right here on this disk! It says it all! Take this. Those men, they killed Donald Chadway. - Hey everybody, listen up! Listen up! - The journalist. - Not you, you little fuck bastard! - He's got a gun! He's got a gun! (all screaming) - Call security! - What the hell's going on? - Get out of here! You've got five seconds to get the hell out of here! - Kill him, that's nonsense! - Drop the gun! (all yelling) Police, drop the gun now! Drop the gun! - Not you! You fucking stay! You let go of me! - Let's get out of here! (all yelling) - Kill me? You can't fucking kill me! (dramatic choral music) (thudding) (kicking) (electric zapping) (harmonica music) - You think Graham's gonna miss his car? - (laughs) Not for a couple years, anyway. (techno rock music)
