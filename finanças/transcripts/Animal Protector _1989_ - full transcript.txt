[music playing] Move it. Move it, boys. Come on! Come on, Smedley. Come on, boys, move it. Move it! Quicker! Come on! Come on, boys. Come on! Come on there. Come on! Come on, boys. Come on! Come on! C squad present and correct, sir. Two minutes down on yesterday, Sergeant. Konzuk It's not good enough. No, sir. Stand easy. When you men go into action, You'll be crossing rivers at night under enemy fire. The success or failure of an advance will depend on your efficiency. Think about that. Smoke break-- five minutes. Squad-- aten-cion! You mob. You broke your mother's heart. But you're not breaking mine. Break up. If we have to go for another bloody swim because of you. It ain't Smedley's fault-- That bloody son of a bitch. Easy to be tough here, ain't it? What are you saying, Smiler? Back here ain't up there, is it? We know why he ain't at the front line, don't we? We have to do better than this. It's Smedley, sir, never make a soldier in 100 years, that lad. Well, he has no choice in the matter. He tries hard enough, Captain-- just not cut out for it. None of us has a choice, Sergeant. There are no choices here. Push! Push! Heave. Come on, lads. Come on, lads. OK. Come on, faster. To give you a hand, sir. Thank you, Captain. Adams, sir. McGuire. Come on! Come on! Come on, Smedley-- who's the angry boy? You want to speak to the private on deployment? Don't count on it, son. Take your place. One, two, three! Heave! One, two, three! Heave! One, two, three! Heave! Come on, guys! One, two, three! Heave! Hey, anytime you girl guys need help, just call the Camp Kingston boys. Somebody is in there. Why didn't he help? A prisoner can't have any contact with men who may be ordered to shoot him, Captain. SOLDIER: Come on back. We'll do it again. I need to say, can I give you a ride? Going to the same place? No, thanks, Major. I'll stay with the men. They need the exercise. Bye! Bye, guys. Later. Corporal? Can I have a cigarette? Get lost, kid. Can I have-- I'll take the truck in, sir. Carry on, lads. Can I have a cigarette, soldier? Cigarette, mister. You got a big sister for me, sugar? Screw off you little bastard. Hey! Left, right, left, right, left, right, left. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left. [horn] You two beauties get out of here if you don't want to end up where he's going. Cops, they're all the same. Yeah, army cops are meaner than civvy cops. If they shoot him here, do you think we'll get to watch? They ain't going to shoot him here, he's done. All the corps guys are all the same. They like to [inaudible] breakfast. It's their job. So what's the news? The brought in a prisoner, sir. A German? No, sir, one of ours. Name of Jones-- desperate bastard, sir. Pardon my French, sir. Going to shoot him down like a dog. Shoot? You're an absurd little man. FREMONT: That's what they said. You're pig ignorant Fremont. Plugging the guy don't make no sense. Sense? You're in the army, Macartney. Yes, bow, like a mad dog. Yeah? Well, this is a hell of a situation. Yes, it's the last thing we need at this stage of the campaign. It's a farce. Ottawa can't possibly confirm the death sentence under these circumstances. HARFIELD: We'll know tomorrow. It's a foregone conclusion, right? HQ has recommended leniency. The Yanks have a prisoner too. And they had an MP shot dead in the incident. Yes, by their man. As I understand it, this Jones is just technically an accessory. But if the Americans execute their boy, well, it could be more than a technicality. This is military business. We're not going to be shoved around by a bunch of pen-pushing seat warmers in Ottawa. I hope you're right, Colonel. Ah, this is our chaplain-- Captain Dumont-- Major McGuire, Provo Corps. Captain. They're stuck on the prisoner. You shouldn't listen to rumors, Padre. [music playing] Will you turn that down, will you? The men can't hear themselves think or pray with that racket. What a disaster area, our Padre-- some kind of S case-- a bad time in Normandy. Who didn't? Anyway, until we hear from Ottawa, we have to assume that the sentence stands. You're not saying it's going to happen here? It's bloody ridiculous. My men are ready to go into action at any day now. Think of the effect on morale. I know how you feel, Colonel. You have very little choice. The first order of business-- an officer to head up the special detail. [singing] [inaudible] platoon. Quick march. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, done. Left, right, left, right, left, right, done. Left, right, left, right, done. Squad halt! Sergeant, I'll just be a couple of minutes. Squad-- Squad will advance right turn! Squad order arms! Squad in arms, ease! That easy. Here comes your lady friend. [speaking french] How are you? Ah, very good. [speaking french] [speaking french]. Je suis dog tired. I am dog towered? [speaking french] OFFICER: Get those kids out of here. Beat it! HARFIELD: He's a good man-- Brigadier Adams' son, you know? Lots of tradition there. I see he ran into some trouble at the landings. That's behind them now. MCGUIRE: There's no doubt as to his reliability. On the contrary, he has every incentive to make good. He's my best officer no question. Well, incentive is half the battle. Cold shower, Johnny? Just the thing. It solves all your problems-- especially problems of a libidinous nature, so I'm told. Is that right? - I wouldn't know. No frustrations, Johnny? It sounds like repression to me-- repressive Captain Adam declared let's up and Adam. (SINGING) His men don't like him, because he made them swim up and down ad infinitum. That's pretty good, eh. Very funny. Seriously, I think you're doing a great job. By the time your boys are ready for action, they'll be the best runners in the army. Excuse me, Captain Adams, sir. The Colonel wants to see you right away, sir. SOLDIER: Why don't you lay off him, Buxton? You know why. He spooked out in the middle of an attack. His men paid the price. They call it shellshock. I've got another word. The man's sentence hasn't been confirmed, sir. That's not the point, John. We have to organize a firing squad, and I want you to command it. - When will we know? When Ottawa decides to tell us. Surely we can wait until word comes down. I'm afraid that's not how it works, John. As far as we are concerned, the execution is going ahead. Arrangements must be put forth. This is a voluntary position, sir? In a manner of speaking. Sir, I think I-- I think I prefer to decline. Nobody likes this, John. We'd all prefer to decline, as you put it. Excuse me, Colonel. We don't expect an immediate decision, John. Take a little time. Think about it. Sir. HARFIELD: That will be all, John. Seems I was wrong. Not necessarily. He refused point blank. Colonel, we're asking him to supervise the shooting of one of our own men. I'd be more worried if he'd agreed. [radio playing] John, John, just a minute. You, uh, left your radio on. You like Bach, don't you, Johnny? You know I do. The Colonel thinks Bach is a rocket. Bach stops the Colonel thinking. Is that good or bad would you say? It depends what he's thinking about. Very true, John. Today, I heard him refer to pen-pushing seat warmers. What a turn of phrase the man has? Are you coming to dinner? Well, after I've looked in know our guests, Jones-- is that his name? - Why ask me? You were summoned-- also present, Major McGuire-- Provo Corps. I can't discuss this, Philippe. They say the boy's facing a death sentence. It's not confirmed. [music playing] Enjoy your dinner? There's nothing wrong with army grub. Better than that frog slop, eh? Snails? Escargots? Jesus! So what's the scoop on this Jones? I'll tell you something-- I wouldn't waste a bullet on scum like that. I just slit the bastard's throat. HARFIELD: It's an uncomfortable situation to say the least. For the moment, we're stuck with it. There's not much chance of it coming off, is there, sir? MCGUIRE: I'd say that second guessing civilians is an exercise in futility. If this was the First War, Jones would 6 feet under by now. We are more civilized these days. I believe we are, yes. Of course, from another standpoint, shooting our own boys does make a kind of sense-- saves transport costs. What do think, John? I think your sympathies are misplaced. HARFIELD: Jones was involved in the murder of an innocent man, Padre. Indirectly. An accessory is as guilty as the man who pulls the trigger. You know that. I find that guilt and innocence are easy to confuse in wartime. MCGUIRE: Really? for me, the distinctions are clearer than ever. HARFIELD: As I was about to say, there'll be a lot of rumors flying around, and I'd advice you all to say nothing to the man until we've got word down from above? Ah, but how far above? I was referring to Ottawa, Padre, a higher authority as your department. John, I'd like a word with you. Well, well, Johnny boy is in the hot seat. I just wanted to say, Captain. Your reaction to our request was perfectly natural. Hmm, there's your credit, John. But if you were to take it on, it'll do you some good-- wipe out that other business, you know? Just give it some thought. I'm thinking about it, sir. [cheers] Come on, boys! Come on, boys. Now! Go! Take it. Move! Go! Get off the soil, man. I don't know about you guys. Come on! Wake up! Smedley, wake up. Come on! Come on! Come on! Yeah, yeah, go! Good sense, Smedley. [cheers] Run, Smedley, run for everybody. Yes, go, go, go, go! [cheers] It's a jolly good show, John. And they shouldn't take it so seriously. It's only a bloody game. We're preparing these men for combat. BUXTON: By kicking a ball around? Bullshit. Out there where the bullets are real, luck and guts are all that count. Luck and guts. [cheers] Major, I don't think I'm your man. Or we're all the army's men, captain. And I guess that's not really apropo. I know you've had a tough time of it, John. But whether we decide to help me or not, it has to be put away. You don't want to talk about it, you don't have to. Fact is, I can hardly remember anything about the land mines. It'd be best. Oh, relax, will you? Yeah. SOLDIER: Ow! Brains all over the shop. Bullshit. Bullshit. SOLDIER: Blew away three Yank MPs. Just goes to show there's some good in everybody. Get it right. It was one MP killed and two just winged. Jones shot the wounded guy. Yeah. Blew his pecker off. I swear to God. Jimmy told me. The hell I did. Crap arists, the two of you. The bastard deserves this bullet anyway. Just for going AWOL? Leaving his pals to face the music is a lousy thing to do. You might think different when you get up there, Greg. Let me at him. Pow! Splash! Yes! Cut it out, Greg. [music playing] MCGUIRE: Captain Dumont? Yes? Major. I get rid of the racket. No, that's all right, Captain. It's uh-- it's pleasant. [music playing] Thank you. What can I do for you? We crossed swords last night, Captain. You annoyed me. And I'm sure my reaction was unbearably pompous. You are friendly with John Adams. If you're asking for my cooperation. I'm asking for your opinion. You obviously know the situation. The sentence is upheld. We should have heard something by now. We haven't. It's not a good sign. God. I'm afraid I can't afford the luxury of outrage, Padre. My concerns are more pragmatic. If Jones is to be-- DUMONT: Pay the capital penalty? Shot. Let's not mince words. If Jones is to be shot, it must be done efficiently. Yes, I know that sounds callous-- inhuman. I want influence, John. Padre, I don't want to push anybody into doing anything-- quite the opposite. I need to feel secure in my choice. I can't help you at all-- sir. MCGUIRE: I see. Well, I wish I could wash my hands of it so easily, Padre. [music playing] Oh. I was hoping to run into you. You should control your sense of humor, Philippe. It doesn't go down all that well. But this Jones situation is a joke, isn't it? A bit of play acting for the boys. I don't know what you're talking about? They won't actually go through with it. I have no information on that score. How about a shrewd deduction, a logical inference, a wild guess? You're talking to the wrong person. That's good. I was afraid you might be the right person. A little light reading, Padre? Hah, you wouldn't begrudge selling these harmless little fantasies. No, my old pal Macartney donated it. I was going to drop that in for Jones. But maybe it's not such a hot idea. I'm not very concerned about Jones. I mean, the men from this camp are headed for the front line. Half of them will never date another girl. I can't get misty eyed about bloody Jones. Points taken, John. Come and listen to music some time. KONZUK: Come on! Come on, boys, faster. Faster! Cover. You're under fire. Let's go. [gunfire] Come on. Come on, boys. [spit] Come on, Greg. Go, Blair. Next! Your men down! Go! Come on. Come on! Come on! [gunfire] You're under fire-- under fire. Come on! Come on! Come on, Smedley. You can do it, Smedley. Come on, Smedley. Come on, Smedo. Come on, Smedley. Your buddies are dry, Smedley. They can't move till you're over. SOLDIER: Come on, Smedley. Come on, Smedley! Come on. You-- get out of here. Chase him off. You heard-- get going. Come on, Smedley. Come on! You can't stay there. [gunfire] These are real bullets, Smedley. [gunfire] You're dead. Your pals are dead. [gunfire] Hey, you, get out of here. [gunfire] Hey, get away from there. Come to me. Don't move! Don't touch that. Stop! [explosion] [music playing] Oh, my dear god. Awful. I'm afraid there's something else. Ottawa has upheld the sentence. I don't believe it. I'm telling you. They're going to send that boy up against a wall and shoot him. Are you going to help those? You'll do this thing. You'll pull the trigger? I'll make my own decision. The Yanks are taking a hard line. They'll have their man executed before the week's out. So we have to follow suit. It's a political decision. Jones was fairly tried and unjustly convicted don't forget. Anyway, it's water under the bridge now. We have our orders. So-- Sir, if it is a volunteer post-- Technically John, nominally take my meaning. Turn it down, I look like a fool. You'll look like a bloody coward again. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Please, sit down for god's sake. John, no officer in this army had a more distinguished career than your father. He was quite an inspiration to me. Your own record is exemplary, of course, except for-- I'm familiar with the report, sir. Commanding a firing squad is the most difficult and painful duty an officer can be asked to perform. John, if you see this through, this report will be obsolete-- a dead issue. And I could go back into action. I guarantee you'll be restored to the active list. But the time to make a decision now, John. We can't wait. I'll do it, sir. You understand this is a voluntary duty. Yes, sir. I volunteer, sir. Good man. Good man. Splash. Come on, man, join us. Thank you, John. I know it wasn't an easy decision to make. And I am, uh, sorry about the loss of your man. It tells me something about what we're up against. To, uh, everything going smoothly. Have you seen Marie? Anybody see Marie? [french] She's gone. Can't blame her, poor kid. Hey, the one thing in Jones's favor, you know? You won't have to eat much more Camp Kingston slop. Right? It's not right. It's not. You can make your own choices in life. You get caught, you pay. I heard he just missed a damn curfew. Yeah, well, I already cut some poor brother's throat. Yank MP. And he shot him. But before that, he was in some kind of gang in Marsen-- Marseneis? Marseilles, George. And it was Rouillon. GEORGE: Hey, if it's not Adam to oversee the firing squad, I guess we'll get someone else. Yeah? Think about it, Mac Jones ain't going to shoot himself, is he? If it's not an order, no thanks. I've killed maybe six of them. I don't follow you, sir. My father-- he wasn't the first to go. He used to say, until you killed your man, you don't know your ass from your elbow. Well, I've killed a half dozen. I never get a taste for it . Some guy that likes it, can't do the job. You lost a brother, Sergeant. Sir, yeah, bloody mess-- any kids? So your wife's alone back home. She must be lonely-- worried. KONZUK: All the wives worry. Excuse me, sir, but is there a point to this? If you volunteer for this operation, you'll be back in Montreal before the end of the month-- long leave. The work will be over before you get called back. OFFICER: Left, right, left, right, left, right, go! [music playing] ADAM: Privates Blair, Dodd, Dorn, Freemont, McCartney, Martineau, Malloy, Patizo, Schneider, Zabrowsky. Detail, attention! Special detail present and correct, sir. Thank you, Captain. Stand easy. Men, you are all fine soldiers, which is why you've. Been chosen for this duty. You must know that you will never face a more difficult mission than this. And we will show our appreciation in some tangible manner. I'm confident that each one of you will live up to the highest traditions of the army. Any questions? No? Good. Carry on, gentlemen. The operation is scheduled for dawn on Friday. Till then, you'll be learning and perfecting the drills involved. Any questions so far? Sir, the Colonel said something about-- about appreciation, sir. We haven't worked out the details yet. I imagine some leave before you go into action. Is this duty an order, sir? Yes. Yes, it is. Anybody else? This is a lousy job. No question. If we do it right, we don't get any thanks. If we screw it up, everybody pays, especially the condemned man. I'm sure I don't have to spell that one out for you. Your first responsibility is not to me, or to Captain Adam, or even the army. Your first responsibility is to that man. Carry on, Sergeant. Squad. Atten-tion! Outside. Fall out! Private Dorn, please stay behind. Are you questioning the order, private. DORN: I joined up to fight the Germans, sir. ADAM: When you joined the army, you accepted its rules. I'm a Quaker, sir, but I thought it was wrong we didn't do our bit against Hitler. So they sort of kicked me out. But this is still against my beliefs. You've made a brave decision. Don't throw it all away now. We've lost this one. Let's not waste any more time. If you disobey this order, you'll be arrested and court-martialed. I know that, sir, but I got to refuse the order. Friday-- four days. This time next week we'll be on leave-- I wouldn't be in your shoes, sweethearts. Think of me next week, pal, getting my leg over a sweet and juicy little mademoiselle. I'll think of you, pal, next week. That's enough. You go and correct your kit. Excuse me, soldier. Hey, guys, look who's coming. We're through with training, Smitto. Think of us next time you're taking a dip in the river. Hey, what happened with Dorn? I just saw him march stuff on the dock. I knew it was going to cop out on us. No guts? No, he's in the crapper. [horn] Hey, get moving! Quick! Come on, Fremont. Hey, move it. SOLDIER: See you, Smedo. Yeah! See you, Smedley! Hey, Smedley. Smedo, Smedo. [singing] We need another man, Sergeant. Yes, sir. - Any ideas? - Well, I think that-- What about O'Donnell? Good choice. Sir, permission to speak, sir? I'd like to volunteer, sir. Make up the strength, sir. I don't think so, son. Why are you volunteering, Private? The job has to be done, sir? Make up the strength, sir. Once you get out of training, sir. You must have heard the fellows. No, sir. Not true, sir. Sorry, Sergeant. Sorry, sir. I can't do it, sir. Roll up! Roll up! Roll up! Roll up! Get 'em now. Your lucky day, you idle little man. The boys of the front would give their right ball to have nice, new weapons like these. Private Blair, 630-75x. Your new lady friend, soldier. Keep her warm. Cherish her. Private Ryan, 874-68l. And make sure you keep it clean. Otherwise, you'll be in up to here. Well, this is nice-- very nice. Yeah, the Sarge said we got to be separated from the other guys. Makes you wonder who is the prisoner. This is the rich boys. What did I say? [inaudible], Sarge. What a craphole. What more do you want? Me? I want to be worked over by a big, fat, sloppy whore. And I don't want us to be stuck here with you ugly bastards. So I suppose somebody has got to see the job's done right. You sure these are the best men you could dig up? Screw me stupid. Is that an order, Sergeant? All right, who's the comedienne. Come on, don't be shy. I like a good laugh as much as the next guy. SOLDIER: Smedley? What are you doing here? SOLDIER: Smedo? Lost your map? Shut up! Shut up! Private Smedley is joining this detail as of now. Oh dear, oh dear, oh deary me-- this really is a girl guy camp. What's the matter sweetie? Lost your purse? John Smedley. Settle in. SOLDIER: Spare bed over here, Smed. Won't be long now, John. No, not long. And back home-- your darling wife waiting with open arms. Home? I'm going up the line. They'll never send you back. It's in the works. You can't be serious. It's very quixotic, John. But it might be better all around to settle for home, you know? I'm on the active list. Good luck, John. John? I'm going to tell Jones now. He doesn't know? Of course he knows. He just hasn't been informed. Apparently, that's my job. But I can't tell him when. It seems he only gets 12 hours. Did you know that? There will be a firing squad. As you said, it's your decision. No. I'm a soldier. I have my duty. I don't want to hear this. I just thought you might like to meet the boy-- talk to him. The regulations absolutely forbid that, as I'm sure you know. Of course, the regulations. Yes, the regulations. [music playing] Yes, this is isolated enough. If that's what we want, why do the thing in the camp at all? We don't want to hide what we're doing, John. We don't want make a circus of it either. Like hey, look, bullet holes. You know what? This site has been used before. The same job if you asked me. Firing range. Maybe that whole wall will be blown to crap. Jerry's been here. Jerry knows this business. Hey, wait a minute. What the hell is this? Maybe that's where she's been hiding out. The kid that lived in the camp. War orphan, I guess. It was her brother that got killed. Well, shall have to get her ass out of there. OK, so Jones stands here-- stands or sits. Prisoner maybe in an upright position, strapped to a post, fixed in the ground if available, or sitting down strapped into a chair. The chair is the easiest thing. We can get a post-- easy enough. Yeah, you might as well be comfortable. Then we'll need straps, restraining, leather, thick, prisoner for the use of. It's all in here. With all the rules, you can't go wrong. Trust the army for that. We don't need straps, and he won't be tied to a chair. As I said, the posts are easily arranged. Yes, absolutely. He's still a soldier. He can stand on his own feet. But we will need stripes. Carry on, Sergeant. For Christ's sake. John, we can hardly blame the lad if he's weak in the knees. The squad must have a fixed target or this could turn into a shambles. You think I'm a cold fish, don't you? John, our charge is to carry out the considered decisions of our superiors as provided for in the drill manual. The regulations. They're not arbitrary, you know? They're there to assist fallible human beings through an appallingly difficult task. Macartney. Oh, wait, wait. Let's see. Whoa. Whoa. Oh. "The Girl We'd Most Like to Get Pinched By.." You dirty minded bastards. Writing on that. Hey, Smedley. I'm like-- you smell like whisky. I want to ask you something. You ever had a woman? Sure. Sure I have-- several. SOLDIER: Not like the dames I got in mind. There's this place in Dunkirk I heard about. For a pair of nylons, a couple of tarts will take turns at you till you're begging, and I mean begging for mercy. That's for me. Could go, huh? It'll be educational. What do you say? [laughter] SOLDIER: Hey, guys, here comes the Sarge. Stand by your beds. Now, we'll see what you can do. Outside In two. Fire. [gunfire] Fire! [gunfire] Fire! [gunfire] Fire! [gunfire] Fire! [gunfire] Well, on today's showing, I'd say Jones's chances are pretty damn good. Philippe, Philippe. I want to fix a time for you to visit the special detail. I'll visit your boys if you're looking on Jones. You know I can't do that. Are you refusing to counsel my men? No. I have no counsel for that. Oh, well it's easy to quibble about words. For you, maybe. You've opted for the side that relies on words-- empty ritual and words. Empty ritual? You're a priest. You do have a duty. The only duty I feel is to that boy. Whatever you think about me, you can't blame the men. They're human. They make decisions. They follow orders. Young Dorn was dragged out of here this morning because he wouldn't take part in your dirty, little drama. This is not my doing. I don't blame the man, John. I'll see them, of course. What you want me to say to them? Not so easy, is it? I have no comfort for them-- over you. I can't play the army's game incentive-- Well, better keep away then. Stay away. Protect yourself. You know, I was thinking. What if you shoot 10 feet above his head? Then he's a goner. No, no, no. Serious. Suppose everybody, all of us, shoot to miss. He dies of a freaking heart attack. I can just see you. Pow! That's not so funny, you know? It's not bloody funny! Take it easy, Fremont. You know, you're full of it. About turn! Ease! Detail present and correct, sir. Stand easy. All right, on the day at this point, the live round in one rifle will be replaced by a blank. Nobody will know whose rifle-- none of you. None of us. Why do we do this? So you can always think maybe you didn't shoot him, sir. Then you don't have to feel guilty, sir. Right idea. Wrong words, soldier. Since You're carrying out the due sentence of law, guilt doesn't enter into it. All right, everybody's in place. The prisoner will be brought in. His eyes will be covered. He won't see you. Put a bag over his head. MCGUIRE: We must finish this as quickly as possible. Captain Adam will give four orders-- present, load, aim, and fire. Only the last one will be given verbally. Sergeant. Present-- load, aim, present, load, aim-- Present-- load, aim, present, load, aim-- questions? What do we-- I mean, how do we aim, sir? There will be a marker. On him, sir? Yes. Now, we'll walk through the drill from the top stopping before the final command. Sergeant? Squad! Atten-tion! Yes, I'm going to see our men now. Thanks, but well perhaps tomorrow might be a better time. The night before the big day. That would be the best time. Tomorrow night. I have to tell Jones he has 12 hours to leave. Also, that in those 12 hours, he can have anything he likes to eat, and drink, and smoke within reason. Can you give me any guidance there, John? What's a reasonable last supper? Philippe, that's unworthy. You're right. It was cheap. Get some sleep, John. I'm fine. I'll come with you. No you won't. Get some rest. [music playing] I have a difficulty. My faith-- my belief-- teaches that every life is sacred. Thou shalt not kill. But that's a bit stupid, ain't it? I mean, in a war, defending your motherland and all that baloney? You really think it's baloney? Padre. DUMONT: Where the hell have you been. A little espionage, sonny? No, sir. We-- yes, sir, we just wanted to see what he looked like, sir. And-- Well, he's a nasty looking fellow, sir. We never saw him. I'm glad too. [music playing] [horn] What the hell has happened? Take it easy, Johnny. One of our trucks at a mine just down the road. Are you sure you're all right? Yes. Yes, I'm fine. [music playing] Come in. Get yourself outside that. [cough] The Ninth-- performed live. [radio static] I can't tune in Berlin clearly on this. Berlin? Yes. DUMONT: Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" performed by Nazis. I guess that's ironic, Philippe. No, it's a message. It looks to a world beyond this madness. But the horror is there in every note. Tension. Listen, it's insane. They play it as if there were doomed. Dead. Dead men looking for redemption at the last moment of recorded time. Listen. It's insane. [radio static] ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): The secret weapon described as a fiery beam capable of destroying an area over a mile long in one devastating blast. DUMONT: I was reading about another wrinkle we have now-- fire bombs full of a sort of burning oil. And did you read about Hitler's death camps? They say hundreds of thousands gassed. DUMONT: I'm sure we are on the right side, John. But back there on the beaches, I buried so many bodies and parts of bodies. Sometimes, when I look at the boys here, all I can see is meat-- just meat. Jones wants to shake hands with the men on the squad. ADAM: You know that's impossible. Yes. I thought perhaps you might represent him. Shake his hand, John. Look him in the eyes. I can't. DUMONT: Don't you owe him even that much? All I owe him is to see it done decently I can't leave this job to the likes of Sergeant Mortlake. Is it just a job then? The army is my profession like my father, all my family for generations. It's a pledge. You're doing this to live up to your father? Would he be proud of you, John? Yes, I think he would. About turn! Pick up arms! Squad right rest. Eyes front! Firing squad-- present and correct, sir. Thank you, Sergeant. The prisoners is in position. I-- sorry, sir. Well, you know the drill. The sergeants will now run you through it until you're split second perfect. Carry on. That should do it. Wife? Fiancee? I just got married before I was sent here. That's good-- good to have someone. Yeah, I guess so. Jenny Mae, we got engaged, because I didn't want her going with a certain guy. Queens. I don't know. She sure is getting to a lot of dances. I'll take two, two cards. My grandmother is in Warsaw. The Nazis are killing all the Jews there-- all of them-- all the Jews. But there's a lot of propaganda. It's probably just that. I've never seen anybody dead. You'll see plenty. He killed my brother. SOLDIER: Stick it, Molloy. Harvesting-- sleeping in the wheat, the lazy little bugger. He ran the combine right over. Yeah, and that's it. OK. Yeah. An accident. What's up, Maury? Mary! SOLDIER: Whoa! Jesus! SOLDIER: Snap out of it, Maury. SOLDIER: Don't fold up on us now. SOLDIER: Get the Sarge. Sergeant. KONZUK: What's the problem? SOLDIER: Sorry, Sarge! I've got the-- KONZUK: The lad's epileptic. Come on. To the latrine, quick. Clear out! Give him some air. I'm sorry, Sarge. You heard. Give him the blanket. Calm down. Calm down. I have seen this 100 times. Come on. It's OK. Just I couldn't stop. I wasn't scared or anything. Like I say, it happens to everybody at one time or another before a battle. So you've got that to come. Know what I say. This war is going to be over sooner than you think. I don't want to go home and say all I did in the fighting was shoot one of our own men. Listen. What you've got to think is this Jones is a bloodthirsty bastard-- lousy deserter. Shut up. I'm starting to think combat is better than this job. You guys think combat is ring around the rosies, eh? I'll tell you, it's noise beating at you till you want to burrow in the earth-- like a worm-- like a bloody maggot boys. When it stops, then it's worse-- much worse. Something's going to happen. Boom! It happens. And you're still in one piece, maybe. But the guy next to your buddy-- he's gone. He's not there. He ain't anywhere, eh? And his guts are all over your boots. KONZUK: Enough, for Christ's sake. I can tell you all you need to know about Jones in two words. Dolally tap. That's limey for nuts. Dolally tap crazy, whacked out. That's your friend, Jones. Dolally tap. No, no, as you were. Excuse me, sir. I was just on my way out, sir. I, uh, just wanted to make sure there were no problems. Our correct-- Yes, sir. ADAM: Good. It's hard to relax, isn't it? Mug of tea, sir? It's fresh-- Yeah, sure. KONZUK: If you want to sit down, sir. Martin-- I can't talk to you now, John. It's 12 hours. I'll tell him for you. I'll tell him. Going to visit the prisoner, sir? That's not your concern, Sergeant. It's not a good idea, sir. It makes it too personal. Excuse me, Sergeant. It's against regulations, sir. It's my duty to point that out. Could you get the hell out of my way? At ease. I want to see the prisoner. Sir, Private Jones, sir. You're Jones. Sir. I didn't think there would be any harm, sir. No. No, not at all. Captain Adam. Yes, sir. Chaplain, sir. He said you might look in, sir. Did he? It's tomorrow. Yes, sir. I sort of guessed that. ADAM: If there's anything you want-- Sir, I was thinking maybe General Farmer could put a word in for me, sir. Why General Farmer? Well, sir, the general came to HQ one time when I was on guard duty. I knew who he was. He was in a big staff car, but I wouldn't let him until he said the password. Sarge-- Sergeant Trent-- he said I was in big trouble. The general-- he has my name. And he said, Private Jones, one damn fine soldier. So I thought maybe-- Private. What's your name anyway? Jones, sir. Oh, Danny, sir, Daniel. General Farmer can't help you, Danny. No, sir. I guess he wouldn't remember. ADAM: Danny, you don't seem to be the sort of man to get in this-- this mess. I did wrong, sir. I know that. Yes, but desertion and accessory to murder. Why? Sir, I was on a day pass in Rouillon with Pedley and Driscoll, these buddies of mine. But they picked up-- well, they met a couple of girls, sir and left me to it. So I just walked about for a bit. And then I ran into Frazier just like that. Frazier? R. Frazier, sir. I guess you don't know him. Frazier-- he's a real card. Well, we went to this sort of party, and I had a few beers, sir. I admit that. Next thing there was shots fired somewhere. Then this guy ran out-- shoved a gun in my hand. I had never seen him before. I see this MP-- Frazier. He's down. He's dead. Frazier. He can make you laugh. Then these Yank MPs ran out, and that was it for me, sir. Changes you, doesn't it? Leaving home, war, all that. I don't just mean learning things. It makes you completely different. See things. Do things that don't fit-- don't belong in your life at all. I never saw her action, sir. We didn't get that far. What you used to be-- how much of that is left when you go home? Well, my dad has had shellshock. One time in a thunderstorm, we found him at the top of a tree crying like a baby. You do understand about this, Danny. It can't be stopped. Not now. I know that, sir. Do you believe in God, Danny? Well, sir, the chaplain says-- Not the bloody chaplain. You. I guess I do, sir. Don't you feel anything about this? Don't you hate us? I'm always-- and you, sir. You have to follow orders, don't you? General Farmer was right, Danny. You are a damn fine soldier. [music playing] OK, men, it's time now. Sir? The train, sir? Of course. Right dress. Left, atten-cion! Quick! March! Left, right, left, left, left, left, left. One, halt! The squad will advance-- right, hut. Squad order arms. Squad dressing. Right dress. First man, one step forward. One step forward over there. Second man wants to step back. All yours, Sergeant. Eyes front! Squad ground arms! [inaudible] turn. Five paces, step forward. March! Keep your eyes to the front. SOLDIER: Left squad! Prison escort, halt! Prison escort, left turn. Escort, right turn. Ahead march. "Private Daniel Jones of the Alberta Fusilliers having been tried by field general court martial and found guilty as charged has been sentenced to die by firing squad. Sentence will now be carried out." The sould if the servant Daniel-- Daniel Jones. Sir, get it over, sir. Get on with it, man. Sir, I refuse. What, Captain? I refuse the order, sir. I refuse the order. You have to give the order, sir. Take over, Major. Forget it, Colonel. It's too late now. Squad-- unload. This way, Captain. [music playing] Danny. It's OK, Danny. Danny? It's OK.
