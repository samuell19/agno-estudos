Have you seen my bracelet? No, sorry, where did you last see it? I don't know, it's probably just somewhere really obvious. So have you guys decided where you're going tonight? Yeah, we're gonna start off at the Crown and then just go from there really. So is Rick still coming over tonight? Yes, he's coming over after work. Mhm, well don't worry, I'll be out of your hair all night. Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, still meeting there. Yeah, I'll see you soon. I'll text you when I'm in the taxi, okay? Okay, bye. Was that Evie? Mhm, Evie. I better finish getting ready. Okay. - I'll see you in a bit. - Mhm. I'll be heading for an early grave. Zoe, my taxi's here, I'm off out now. Okay, have a good night. Yeah, you too, babe. Tell Rick I said hi. Yeah, will do. I got to find one. Dad took my laptop off off me. What for? Nothing really. Watching too much anime. Guess he thought it might cure me or something. Cure you? Hello. Don't hurt me. I'll only hurt you if you struggle. Oh fuck. Nice to see you, Rick. Hello, beautiful. What's wrong, you okay? These handcuffs really hurt. Oh shit, sorry. - Yeah. - Yeah, get those off. Hey, listen, I didn't hurt you or anything, did I? No, don't be silly. - Yeah? - No. It was what you wanted, yeah? Yeah, you know it is. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay, sorry. We don't have to talk about it. Okay. What? Nothing, I just missed you, that's all. Did you have a good week at work? It was okay. Oh, did you you pick up... Did I pick up? Of course, my lady. It better be the good stuff. Please, have I ever let you down? Yes. How about you get up and I'll get us some drinks? - Yeah, that's fine. - Yeah? Oh, actually, babe, have you got any food? - Yes, I do have some food. - You do. Yeah, I'm just a little bit, you know. ♪ Regulations, regulations ♪ ♪ On the train ♪ You gonna find some food, babe? When you're done. ♪ Regulations, regulations ♪ ♪ Regulations, regulations ♪ ♪ Always petty regulations ♪ ♪ Regulations, Regulations ♪ Oh shit, sorry babe, are you all right? Do you need a hand?

Shit, you know what it might be actually? What? It might be an alien, an alien life form. - I'm not joking. - Yeah? I'm not joking. Babe, come on, you're just being paranoid. There's no one there, okay? Ass. See, I told you there's nothing there. Yes? We spoke on the phone earlier about the room. Oh, blimey, Owen I presume. Please come in. Oh, can I help you with that? No, it's fine, thank you. How was your journey? Took longer than I expected. Well, let's get you settled in. If you head up to the first floor, your room is the first door on the left. I'll put the kettle on while you unpack. Before the song, we got some shoutouts to do. So I want to say hello to... - Morning. - Oh, morning, love. I made some fresh coffee, want some? No thanks, I don't have time. Amy's gonna be here soon. What time are you working till? I'm there till close I think. Are you sure you're ready for this? Dad, we've been over this. I just think if you wanted to start working, you could get something more suitable for you. Yeah, I know, but this is just for now. Just to get me back on my feet. And we've also got one... I just get worried. I know, there's nothing to worry about. They listen to me every Monday morning. Well, thank you. Oh, I better go. Don't forget your keys. Got them. Oh, Jenna. Tonight we have an old school classic. Yes? Have a nice day at work. Thanks, Dad, I love you. I love you too, darling. And follow us on our social media. - Hello! - Hello. Aw, you okay? I've been better. Aw, why, what's up? I'm late studying for my exams. I'm really falling behind. No, I'm sure you're gonna do fine. I hope so. Don't want to be stuck working at Mom an Dad's place for the rest of my life. I'm sure there are worse places to be working. Come on. Knock knock. Come in. Here you go, nice cup of tea. Thank you. Well, it's my pleasure. Oh, um... Oh, no, it's all right. A lot of visitors seem to have an interest in misfortunes this town has suffered in the last few years. Seems a little morbid for my taste, but each to their own I say. Just do me a favor. A lot of people around here are very sensitive about what's happened in the past. Try to keep your interests to yourself. Not everyone's as understanding as I am on the matter. Well, I'll let you settle in. Oh, drink your tea before it gets cold. I'll just be downstairs if you need anything. You going to Evie's this weekend? I thought we were working that night. That's the benefit of working for parents. I'll have a word with my dad. See if we can get off work early. Yeah, Ames, I don't think I'm really ready - for a party yet. - Aw but it'd be good for you. Plus, you never know. You might end up hooking up with someone. I should be so lucky. Carl might be there. What, I wouldn't kick him out of bed for farting. I don't really want a relationship at the moment. Who said anything about a relationship? Yeah, I haven't really thought about any of that kind of stuff, not since... Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Oh, I never meant to bring that up. No, it's fine. Honestly, it's fine, I'm just being silly. And I think I'm a bit nervous about today, so. Oh, you'll be fine, especially with me showing you the ropes. You know I'm here if you want to talk. I know. I just need to get on with my life and just put all this behind me. It's what Zoe would've wanted, so. She'd be proud of you. I know. And I really appreciate your mom and dad doing this for me. Anyway, oh my god, let's just not get on a downer. - Yes, I agree. - Let's go. How's my hair look? Gorgeous. It better. Excuse me. Yes, what do you want? I was just. I was wondering if you come into these woods often. And who wants to know? Oh, I'm an investigator of sorts. You see, I'm looking into the history and the murders and the disappearances that have happened in this town. And I know that there's been a lot of evidence found in these woods, so I was just thinking... And what exactly are you implying? Oh no. Oh, no, no, I just wanted to know if you've seen anything. Now you listen here. There's been too much loss and sorrow in this town in the past without people like you coming here to try and dig it up. Now I advise that you go back to where you came from. Because if you go looking for trouble, then you just might find it. Don't go. I said leave. You're a natural. How you finding it so far? Yeah, I like it. Just wait till the lunchtime rush. That's the real test. Oh, I'm sure can handle it. So sorry I didn't warn you. Oh, look what the cat dragged in. Hey, bitch. Love you too, darling. Don't look him down. I'm joking. Hello, Pete. Hello. Hello, Jenna, are you all right? - Yeah. - Haven't seen you for ages. I know, it's been a while, hasn't it? Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm good, thanks. - And you? - Yeah. Amy said you got a job here now. Yeah. I don't know why you'd want to work in a dump like this. Anyway, I was just passing by. And we found this amazing venue for the party. It's gonna be so good. Where is it? Blossomfield? Blossomwood. Yeah, Blossomwood. We rented out one of the barns there. So we can stay over and you can do whatever you like. It's gonna be so good. Very posh. Yeah, there's around nothing, so we can just do what the hell we like. You should come. Yeah, I don't know yet. Everybody will be there. And I think you should take time for yourself. Well, I'll try to. Babe, make a move. Yeah, in a minute. Anyway, girls, it was good to see you. - Bye. - Hope you come, Jenna. - Yeah. - Babe. You're so impatient. - See you later. - See you later, bye. Sorry, I didn't know she was coming. No, it's fine. It was nice to see her. She's a pain in the ass. I do love her though. Yeah, yeah, I feel bad cutting everyone off for so long. You shouldn't, they understand. Yeah, anyway, I'm gonna get back to work. You fuckin' twat, you scared the life out of me. What the fuck do you think you're doing? Fucking stupid clown cunt. No, no. Oh my god, sorry. Sorry, I can I help you? Don't you remember me, Jenna? No, should I? Charlotte, Zoe's friend. Oh my god, I'm so sorry, I didn't recognize you. How have you been? You know, I'll never understand why Zoe picked you to move in with her over me. I'm betting it's her mother's decision. Bitch never liked me. Yeah, sorry, I need to go actually. Buh-bye. Your change. Yeah. And we're closed. Are you all right? Yeah, I think so. I don't know. One of Zoe's friends was just outside acting really weird. Weird how? I don't know, just really creepy. Well, what did she want? Nothing, I don't know. Are you sure you'll all right? Do you want me to get my dad? No, no, honestly I'm just being paranoid. And she's gone now anyway, so it's fine. Come here, you draft sod. Aw, thank you. Hey, Zoe, this guy's got the best shit. Who? And he gave me a freebie. Come on, Charlotte, I don't do that shit anymore. Well, he's got more back at his place.

Yeah, okay, you really need to leave me alone now, Charlotte, because I've told the police everything I know. So you just need to leave me alone now. What happened to Zoe, Jenna? I don't know. Get the fuck of me. I'm sorry. What the fuck are you doing? I'm sorry. Oh my god, you don't just grab a fucking stranger in the streets. Who the fuck are you? My name's Owen. Why are you following me? Because I wanted to talk to you about your friend Zoe. Is he bothering you or what, this guy? What do you know about Zoe? I want to talk to you about her and her friend. I think I know what happened. Please, can we talk? I'm all right honestly, thanks. You know, you really need to work on your people skills. Grabbing me like that was not cool at all. I'm sorry, I'm not used to being around people. So are you gonna tell me what this is all about? I want to know what happened that night. Not much to tell really to be honest. I was out drinking with friends and when I got home, I found Rick dead in our hallway. No sign of Zoe anywhere. Police didn't really tell me much of anything to be honest. And as far as I know, it's still an open case. Can't get the sight of him out of my mind. I know what that's like, I'm sorry. Well, it's been almost a year and no word from the police. You said you might know something. Yes, I used to live here when I was little, and I spent so much time in the woods. I would carry a branch, and it was my sword. I used to think that I was so brave. You can't be serious. He knew who I was and what I had seen, and then I saw him everywhere. It was like some twisted game of hide and seek. And my parents, they said there's nothing to worry about, but they were wrong. So what happened to your mom? They couldn't find her like Zoe? Oh, they found her, and she wasn't my mom anymore. She was different. Who is he? I don't know! He's a ghost or an urban legend. Something they tell to people around a campfire. People never believe me. They don't believe that he exists! Do you know why that is, Owen? Because this is bloody ridiculous. I mean, you can see that, can't you, that this is ridiculous? Your friend Zoe is alive! No, she isn't. I think you're full of shit. I think you're crazy. I think you're wasting your time. Stop, don't go. Get off me. Zoe is dead. And the police are gonna find whoever killed her. So you just need to let it go. If I see you again, I'm calling the police. So you know the rules? Yeah, yeah whatever you say, babe. Are you sure about this? It's gonna be fun. Okay. Here. Okay. Kinda like this, yeah? I'm not hurting you or anything. - No. - You sure? Yes. Because you know you can say at any point if it pulls you. If you want like a... - Just tie it, just tie it. - Like a safe word. Yeah, sure, okay I'm good. Okay, let's do this. Let's rock and roll, let's do it. Really, how? You serious? - No. - Oh, you're so shit. I need to teach you to tie them better. Sorry, I'm not very good at it obviously. It's okay, practice makes perfect. Get off me! What now, Charlotte? What do you want now? So hostile, Jenna, something bothering you? Yeah, why are you following me? I mean, it's getting seriously creepy. I just wanted to ask about Zoe. You know, our mutual friend. The one you were the last person to see alive. What the fuck are you implying? What, that I'm some psycho murderer, is that it? I don't know, Jenna, you said it, not me. And you don't seem too bothered about it. How fucking dare you. You don't know anything about me, Charlotte. You have no fucking idea what it's like to find a corpse in your home. I mean, you don't know what it's like, do you, to not feel safe anywhere and to constantly, constantly feel guilty because you feel like somehow you could've prevented it. So fuck you, Charlotte, fuck you. Hey, what's all this? Sorry. What's wrong? Nothing. Can I please have some water? Of course. Do you need to take the day off work? No, honestly I'm fine, promise. What's happened? So Charlotte just practically accused me of murdering Zoe. And then there's this nutjob who's basically trying to tell me that some urban legend has kidnapped her. And it's all just got a bit much. Fuckers. Oh my god, I just feel like I'm going fucking mad. You're not going crazy. Just had a lot to deal with recently. Coming back to work is stressful enough for anyone. Do you know what? I think I will go to that party. Are you sure? Yeah, fuck it, I just need to forget all of this nonsense and just have some fun. Atta girl. - Thank you. - It's okay. What do you do? - Wait. - There you go. Is it A or B to kick? Rick, Rick. - You're losing. - Wait, is it A or B? Rick, what do you do? - Wait, don't. - There you go. - Don't kick me like that. - That's it. - I'm not even... - Yes. - No. - Yes. - Wait, wait. - Yes, come on! In your face, motherfucker. You're supposed to let me win at these things. Well, I can't help it. Just whooped your ass three times in a row. I can win at loads of stuff actually. - Yeah, I'm sure you can. - Yeah, yeah, I can. - Yeah. - I'm just gonna have my victory beer over here. Oh, the victory beers I bought. - It looks good. - Yeah, whatever. Don't give me those eyes. I'll come over there, I swear to god. Don't, no, don't. Don't make me come over there. Okay, you forced my hand. Tie me down. Let's go. - You like that? - Mhm. Like to be strapped, yeah? I guess I could tie you to the bed right now and have my way with you. - No talking. - Yeah? Oh fuck. Who's that? It's my dad. Oh great. Do you want to me to leave? Oh no, no, it's fine, it's fine. He's just drunk and crashing on the couch like he always does. - Come on, stay, please. - It's bloody weird though. I'm gonna go. I'll have my own apartment soon, and you can come over. And we can make as much noise as we want. Don't go. Fine, I'll stay a little while, then I have to go, okay? - Yeah. - Okay? - Okay. - Cool. Ow. Help me. Rick? Tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary since Zoe Bates and Rick Barker were involved in vicious attacks at these apartments. What started out as a night of passion ended in bloodbath for the long lovers. Mr. Barker's mutilated body was found in the early hours by roommate Jenna Carter as she returned home from a night out. However, the body of his.... Hello. Hello? Speaking. No, I'm not bloody interested. Don't ring this number again. Jenna, is that you, love? Get off, get off! Hi, Dad. Dad? Dad? Dad, I'm just going out with Amy, okay? We're going to a party up at Blossomwood Farm. So just call me if you need me, okay? Okay, sleep well. I'm gong now, Dad. What are you laughing at? Stop it. What are you laughing at? Where is she? What have you done with her? Jenna! Where is she? No! I hate you! Hey. Hey, how's it going? Good, you all right? - Good. - Sweet. You all right? Jenna, Amy, get your ass in here? Hey. Would you like got some drinks? - Yes. - Some shots. Are you having fun? Huh? Are you having fun? Yes, always. Where's Pete? Oh, he's at work, he's gonna come down later. Hey, Charlotte, have you met Amy and Jenna? We've met. Hi. Where's the bathroom? Upstairs, you can't miss it. All right. She's really mad. If you only knew. Rachel, stop humpin' the damn dog. Are you still glad you came? Come on. Come on, let's go and mingle. Zoe. Who's there? Rick? Come on, who else is it gonna be? No, no, you're dead. Oh, you kept me alive, Zoe. Come on, come here, yeah? It's okay, it's okay. Shh, I got you, I got you. Look, I'll always be here for you. Am I going crazy? Well, you always were pretty crazy, but hey that's why I loved you. You're still an idiot I see. Yeah, some things never change. But you can still get out of this. You can still win this thing. - It's hopeless. - Don't give up, okay? The Zoe I knew never gave up. Hey. Oh not now, Charlotte, please. Wait, Jenna, I want to apologize for before. I was a bitch. Forget about it, it's fine. We all had a tough time over the last year. Doesn't excuse what I did, and nobody more than you. I guess I was just jealous. I was never as close to Zoe as you. Zoe loved you. I just miss her. Wish they'd catch the fuck who did it. It's worse not having anyone to blame. I know. And I guess I tried to put that blame on you. ♪ With no sense of shame ♪ ♪ It's been there all your life ♪ It's okay. So you seen Evie? No, not recently. Jenna. Thank you.
