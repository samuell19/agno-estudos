The Daughter of the Samurai Mama, did brother ride on a big boat like this? Yes, that's right. It was a long time ago. When you were still in my tummy. Telegram! Telegram! I don't like telegrams. -There are good ones, too. Teruo is coming home. He is? I bet he's become a great man. I'll have to go meet him. It's an earthquake. Emiko, you're a good girl so not afraid. To be strong... to this end the nature of this country has educated the Japanese. Because of the many earthquakes? Earthquakes... volcanos and typhoons. A tough nature and not much land for so many people. Are these the two most essential attributes of Japanese character? At least the most important. And the famous love of a Japanese for his country Why don't you mention that? That's taken for granted. No need to talk much about it. Look, those rocks over there! Fabulous the wild shores of Japan. Yes. Here the storms of two millennia have been repelled. And these storms always came from the West? Always from the interior of Asia? The dangerous? Yes. And from Europe? Till now they were only winds. In most cases, even tempting. At least useful. Such a marvelous machine, isn't it? Such a marvelous machine! We built that! And woe to our old Nippon, if we had not learned that from you... there would probably be no free Japan now. What is it? -My brother's coming home. My brother's coming home. My brother's coming home. West Wind Go on? What's that dreamy look again? May I not look at that with which I'm pleased? You may not. There. Look rather at that chimney! Up there the wind blows from the west as well. Come on now stop all your nonsense. We're almost there and I still don't have my first interview with a famous Japanese. Sit down here and answer my questions. Ah, you journalists! Well, dear, how was it again? Your father's a rice farmer at the foot of Mount Fuji the descendant of an old samurai family. Your older sister is as merry as you. But better educated! -I hope so! You don't know your youngest sister as you left before she was born. So that was eight years ago. How old are you anyway? -Secret! Then under 30. You've studied natural science and practiced at the University for Agriculture. What you want to do with it you don't yet know. But you hope to be of use to your country. An enormously interesting interview! Just wait. It will become interesting yet. Once more about your adoption. At that time, before you went to Europe, you were adopted by an old, wealthy family, right? -Yes. What was the name of the adoptive father? Iwao Yamato. -Iwao Yamato. What I don't understand is why one adopts a son from another family in Japan? To avoid the severance of the ancestral line. The blood must be preserved. That would still be preserved with a daughter. But not the family name. Nice custom! We overlook that. Yes, but tell me... You actually must marry the daughter of your adoptive father? And even adopt her name. Of course. Then you've been engaged since your youth? Yes, unfortunately. Look. Now the wind's blowing... from the east again. Well, east wind and west wind... will always blow from different directions. What's her name anyway? Mitsuko. Mi-tsu-ko... a beautiful name! Young mistress! Young mistress! What is it? Don't. Stop it. Really? -Brother Teruo? I'm so happy. Brother Teruo is coming home. Father. Father. So... when are you getting married? Stop it, father. Brother arrives in Yokohama tomorrow. Tonight, let's go by express to Tokyo. Really? I wonder what I should wear? European of course! Excuse me for breaking in. Never mind. Thanks for coming. But it is time for the German hour. Lesson time? But I think she's too excited. I doubt she'll learn anything. Right, Mitsuko? What? Is she to wear Western clothes? Yes. -Oh well. Better she didn't. Why would I have advised you... to wear a European dress? I will better... please him. No...: I will please him, you will please him... He will please me... And I hope: She will please him. Who... she? Now tell me. Are we in Japan or in Berlin? Yes! We have two faces - one old and one young. I never imagined Tokyo being like that! Welcome. Welcome. -Two rooms with baths. Is there any mail for me? I'm Yamato Teruo. -One moment, please. because of the early arrival of your ship we unfortunately cannot come for you before tomorrow morning your adoptive father and mitsuko Bad news? Tomorrow morning my adoptive father is coming. So what? -He brings Mitsuko with him. Poor Mitsuko. I waid Father. Father. I should have studied the piano more. Girls over there are usually good at it? It's all right. Oh, yes... I've learned so much! Now the poor girl has spent her whole youth learning for you, preparing for you, with the sole intention of being a good wife for you one day. And you? Look, Teruo, you already knew all about it. You knew how such a girl is trained for her service. You should have realized sooner what a catastrophe you'd cause for such a person who's been waiting 8 years... in innocent anticipation of this marriage. That was her purpose in life. You've taken this and the generosity of her father as well. The expense of 8 years study in Germany is no small thing. And now, suddenly, when you come back to Japan... where you can benefit from all that study... now, all of a sudden... No, one can't escape so easily from the morals of one's country. It's not as easy as you think! I really never thought of it as being that easy... but I just closed my eyes to it. Then you must take the consequences as well. What consequences? To abandon your individual wishes! What - my individual freedom? In this matter, you have no right to individual freedom any more! I always have that! That's just what I've learned in your Europe! Then you've just learned something wrong! Teruo, do you hear? How they all march in the same step? That's what Japan's power is built upon. And these are all individualists? Come! They'll be here any moment. Now, in any event, be nice to her, you hear? But I just can't. My God. At least take a look at the girl first! In the end, you may even like her! So... okay? Well, good. Why don't Japanese women realize they look nicer in kimono? My adoptive father! Dad! Ah, Teruo. It's good you've returned. Thank you. The ship arrived sooner than planned. -Is that so. But you needn't have come especially. I'd like to introduce my university friend. I am very pleased to meet a colleague of my son. Where did Mitsuko go? Mitsuko, this is Teruo's friend, Miss Storm. My little daughter, Mitsuko. Your fiance has already told me so much about you! I hope that we will become good friends! I plan never to forget. But when you welcomed me into your family... I was just a child. But, because well... How far must an adopted son... forget his personal freedom? I didn't have the ability to think about it then. But now I know that personal freedom is... something irreplaceable. In Europe, it's the important thing I learned. And so? In other things, I'll do as you wish. But marrying Mitsuko is the one thing I'd like not to have to do. It's not possible. Even if I love her as a sister... I just can't love her as a sexual partner. I can't. You're a samurai daughter. Come in. Oh pardon, excuse me! Oh - my great pleasure! Excuse me! Please! I came to inquire how your daughter is. Please, just speak German! Mitsuko is very happy... to find you here. Aren't you, Mitsuko? I... I am very happy. It's wonderful, isn't it? Well...? That almost looks as if you wanted to go to Europe again! No, Gerda. I am Japanese and want to live for Japan. But look. This country, Manchukuo... is twice as large as your Germany or my Japan. There is still new earth in abundance that could feed many more people if it were cultivated properly. But first order and peace must be established. And that is the mission of the Japanese people. We must do an immense amount of development in these countries. And we will do that. Now look... such a country requires not only men, who are real men, but also women, who are real women. Not pampered little dolls from rich homes. Do you understand? -Yes! But don't you think your parents were so wise, to find you such a woman? Eh... they don't have a clue... of what I need. Father. I don't want to be in Tokyo any more. There's always a way out, Teruo. In any case, you should go see your family. You were so looking forward to seeing your mother. There are two people here to meet you. My father! I'll be right there. But don't talk about it yet. But I have to talk! It seems my son has completely changed. He seems not to regard me as his father. This time I'm shocked. For his sake, I've taken the first step and written to his uncle, the wise teacher. I'm sure it will lead to a good result. A flood from the west is approaching That dissolves the bonds of family. And the sons no longer bow To their fathers. East Wind It'll get better the longer you're home. I'm not yet used to Japan. Maybe I was too long in Europe. That's not so. Just look. Is spring this beautiful over there? Why don't we eat here? Yes, let's do. Let's sit there. It's quite a nice place. Really nice. Japanese style is good. Sure, because your Japanese. Do you understand old songs? Only a little. Do you understand them? Not very well. But within me, the blood of my ancestors seems to. Hearing them, I feel like I remember the past. Master. I always believed some day... you'd remember your old teacher. Japanese never forget an old teacher. Is that so? -Even in foreign countries. Come inside. My son - it's been a long time since you could hear the voice of your teacher, and you have since - in these western countries - indeed studied much and gathered much wisdom, that is named over there with the word "modern". And you've been right, if you have set much hope into the tone and the content of this word. For woe, if our people would want to deny the forces that lie therein. These western people seem helpless in their restless pursuit of progress. And it is good you've inhaled a little of the spirit of the West, for it has become necessary that our aged Nippon can persist in the struggle for the space of the earth. But if you have ever learned anything from your old teacher, then listen once again to his voice. What our common ancestors once darkly felt or clearly thought, this matter of millennia we today summarize in the short word "shinto". A small particle of this ancient knowledge, however, states: You are, as a sole individual, not so important, for you are only a small link in the long chain of your ancestors. But even the smallest link is the bearer of the whole chain, and thus responsible to the whole that was before him. and responsible for that which follows, which is passed on from his blood. And again, this blood is only a drop, flowing by in the eternal stream of the life of your people, whom you owe everything, and whose source of origin therefore is the deepest and highest you can subserviently bow to in childlike awe. The bow to one's own father however shall be the daily sign of your love and gratitude towards the whole, that for us has the name: Japan. Papa, brother's boat sank. No, the west wind battered it. Father. Teruo. It's you. Yes. It's okay, father. It's good you came home. My cute little Emiko. Yes. Did you bring a present? Yes. I did. That's my house. Mother. Is that Teruo? It's good you've come home. You've grown so much. I didn't recognize you. It's good earth, but it's old. It's really old earth. Mr. Yamato is very pleased that you've accepted his invitation! And he's very reassured by your statement. Oh, it was also of concern to me to clarify the relationship between Teruo and me. You... you are to him... a real friend. Yes. And that's why I understand his conflict. See... here - one's own person. There - the strict laws of family. The family is the foundation of our state. The rock on which we have built. The fullest concept, however, is "our sacred house". Thousands of years of storms have broken before it. Our Japan is our sacred house. Our sacred house is Japan. It is what we live for and what we die for. I hear an old samurai speaking. And a Japanese of today. Young mistress. Take it. I don't need it any more. What a waste. Mitsuko. Mitsuko What's wrong? Don't you understand? Gerda Storm is my guest. Yes, I understand. You understand now. Don't let yourself be deceived - the girl's condition is dangerous. One can hardly imagine - with such quiet, gentle beings... Don't believe that. In these small Japanese women lies dormant the same... volcanic temper as in the men of this volcanic country, and once... either the volcano eruptes, or... -Or...? or they rush into it. Ah - there she is. A letter has come. Teruo A letter has come. My son! You know that the dissolution of an adoption... contradicts the old ways of your people and would exclude you from the bosom of your family. I cannot bear the responsibility for a such a decision by myself and I therefore ask you to appear before your family council... the day after tomorrow at 2 in the afternoon. Your father. I must leave but will be back. May I help you? Yes... Ah, what a beautiful kimono! May I take a look? Oh, please. Maybe you will like it. It's really wonderful. It looks so festive. Is it for special occasions? - Yes. It should become you very well! One wears it only once in a lifetime. And... you... did you already wear it? No... Maybe... tomorrow. Tomorrow? What's that? Just the volcano. He is wild. Dear Teruo! When you arrive here today and do not find me here.... you will later realise it is right. Take care of your little Mitsuko. This girl will one day wear her wedding kimono... If necessary, even without you standing by her side. In the distance I can already hear the grumble of the volcano! But I hope both of you can keep in good memory Your German friend, Gerda It's really too bad you're already leaving. Teruo should be here soon. When he arrives, would you first give him this letter? Yes ... please. It's for the better if we do not meet each other here. Believe me, if... Oh, but you're very wrong to let your daughter wait table herself. It's part of the education of our daughters. Mitsuko, didn't you offer her a knife and fork? Knife and fork? But no, chopsticks are alright with me. I will show you. It's not as easy as it may look. Ah! ... that way? Hey - keep still... Splat... Ah, peas. Gee... just as round as ours! - Pardon? - Oh, how do you have... side dishes in Germany? Ah... So, na... No, it just won't... That won't work, just won't work... Well well, even in Japan one has some inner struggles... Aahh... Attention Attention! Keep quiet! Teruo should have come by now. Go and look. You must also learn to drink sake. Cheers! This is our national drink. Ours is beer! Cheers! It's really nice here at your place. Just... you know... it's a bit scary. The volcano is so close... There blows... a dangerous storm over the earth. For you it comes from the east, for us it's blowing from the west. Report to your country that here in the farest east a people keeps guard on its rocky islands. At their walls this storm will break. I'm very sorry to trouble you when you're all so busy. I asked Teruo to be present today... but seeing as he's not yet arrived... I assume my letter reached him late. I also admire it. I agree with what my elder brother said. But we must keep in mind the tide of the times. It's not easy now to quickly correct the thinking of the young. What is it about Mitsuko that he doesn't like? You raised her so well There is no womanly thing she can't do. And no matter what is said... as a good wife all should go well. I've also labored hard for Mitsuko's education. After all, she has no mother. Of course I could not do enough. Teruo says that Mitsuko to him can be no more than a sister. He seems to think of her as a hinderance. I couldn't give my child to someone like that. The tender blossoms of the cherry Fall and float to the ground To make room For the thronging fruit. To our thinking, adoption is... a particularly serious matter. It cannot be so easily revoked. But especially now Iwao's magnanimous feelings are... I give my heartfelt appreciation. And to my father for... my recent disrespect, my deepest apologies. Once again, with my free will... As a new member of the family... After hearing your magnanimity... I'd like to be allowed to join you. Dear Teruo! When you arrive here today.... and do not find me here, you will later realise it is right. I'd like to speak to Mitsuko. She's probably in her room. Teruo... the volcano! I can hear the volcano... The volcano is so close! Where did Mitsuko go? Her wedding clothes are gone. Could I climb to the crater? You must go around the lake and climb from the other side. But today it's too dangerous to climb. Why? -The wind's from the west... The smoke is blown this way. Okay. That's not good. She's there. Mitsuko. At last we can talk together alone. But we can speak German! What?! You have learned German? I will please you - You will please me - We will please each other. Come ahead, auntie. Thank you. Gerda Storm, Hotel Europe, Tokyo I wish you this with all my heart Your German friend, Gerda Storm She was a good friend to you. And you... will be a good wife to me. Your grandfather and great-grandfather... and ancestors before that have all worked this land. Just like me, they diligently planted and harvested with perseverance. For thousands of years or longer... our ancestors have gone in the mud and worked. Your father and your father's father and all our fathers have worked on this earth. They all were very often tired from all the work as today your old father is tired from plowing and sowing and harvesting the rice. But the rice has to be sown and harvested, otherwise there is no Nippon! Maybe it's a thousand years, my son, perhaps even more, I do not know, that our ancestors have bent their backs stood in the water and treaded the water wheel. I do not know how long it has been this way. But one thing your old father knows: today we are too many for this little piece of earth. We are too many, my son Teruo. Manchuria Become a child of the earth, too. German Translation and Subtitles: Kurosuke @ Karagarga Japanese Translation and Subtitles: retroTV @ Karagarga De->Eng: Kurosuke @ KG Jp->Eng: retroTV @ KG
