Woman over P.A.: The Pleistocene Museum was founded here in 1879 by Armand Kavorkian. Man over P.A.: You have asked about the smilodon, given its common name because of the large canines protruding out of its mouth. Commonly known throughout North America during the Ice Age... ISN'T THIS COOL, SWEETIE? ...the smilodon was a beast to be reckoned with. It could deliver a biting reach... - DUDE, KEEP A LOOK OUT. - ALL RIGHT, HURRY UP, MAN. KEEP YOUR PANTIES ON. WHAT'S THE HOLDUP? YOU'VE GOTTA SEE THIS. WHOA. DUDE. I TOLD YOU. Boy: THIS THING IS HUGE. Boy #2: YOU'RE TELLING ME. "SCIENCE" MAGAZINE SAID THESE THINGS ALL GOT WIPED OUT BY A PATHAGON. THIS SECTION'S OFF-LIMITS, YOU KNOW. FOR THE RECORD, IT'S NOT "PATHAGON." IT'S "PATHOGEN." GERMS, THEY CAN KILL YOU-- OR EVEN AN ENTIRE SPECIES FOR THAT MATTER. DO YOU READ THAT MAGAZINE TOO? OH, YEAH YEAH. I HAVE A LIFETIME SUBSCRIPTION. - IS IT YOURS? - I LIKE TO PRETEND HE IS. COOL. COME ON, WE'RE GONNA GET IN TROUBLE. - GOTTA GO. - SEE YA, MISTER. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER. (sighs) (high-pitched whine) (high-pitched thrumming) WELL, YOU'RE FULL OF SURPRISES, AREN'T YOU? (dramatic music playing) OKAY, THERE WE GO. (knocks on door) (door opens) Man: CHESS OR CHECKERS, DOC? I VOTE CHESS. Man #2: NOT TONIGHT, GORDON. I'VE GOT SOME HOMEWORK HERE. - DON'T YOU EVER SLEEP? - WELL, I TRY TO AVOID IT IF I CAN. SO MUCH HISTORY, SO LITTLE... TIME. (gasps) - (chimes) - OH, NO. - (yells) - WHAT'S THE HURRY, DOC? ARE YOU LATE FOR A FUNERAL? JACK'S BIRTHDAY! Man: PROJECTIONIST'S LOG 06-06-07: IN AN ATTEMPT TO VANQUISH HER DISAPPOINTMENT OVER HER FATHER'S EMPTY-HEADEDNESS, WE HAVE DECIDED TO ADVANCE THE MAIDEN VOYAGE OF THE STARSHIP THEATER. GIVE ME ALL SHE'S GOT, CAPTAIN. RIGHT. AYE, MATEY. SQUIRRELLY, GET ME RUM - FROM BELOW. - YES, SIR. (Western music playing) HE KNEW I NEEDED HIM TO GET MY LICENSE. IT'S TWO HOURS, 13 MINUTES AND TWO MISSED PHONE CALLS. THIS IS A NEW RECORD. NOT IF YOU COUNT THE TIME THAT HE FORGOT TO PICK YOU UP AFTER BALLET CAMP LAST SUMMER. - FORGOT THAT. - MMM. I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS, HONEY. I WOULD HELP YOU IF I COULD. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT MY FATHER'S DEFECTIVE. GIVE ME CREDIT. I GOT THE BALL ROLLING. MOM WOULDN'T LET THIS HAPPEN. NO, SHE WAS YOUR DAD'S BETTER HALF, AND HE'S FEELING LIKE HALF A MAN WITHOUT HER. Cowboy: You killed my father. - Now you must die! - HE'LL GET OVER IT. AI, CAVAC-- I-- HANG ONTO THAT. - I'LL SAVE THE DAY. - (phone beeping) HMM. (hums) (switch clicks) (muttering) UH-HUH. EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD. UH-HUH. DID I PAY THE BILL? NOT TOO LATE. A COUPLE HOURS. GET OVER THERE BY 3:00, 3-- GOD, MAYBE THEY CLOSE AT 3:00. KEYS, WHERE DID I PUT MY KEYS? (engine sputtering) Man: WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO HOME? I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING THAT'LL CHEER YOU UP. NOT ANOTHER "TWILIGHT ZONE" MARATHON. I'M THINKING "THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL." - Jack: HEY, GRANDPA. - YEAH? Jack: LOOK. Man: H-E-DOUBLE-HOCKEY-STICKS. THIS IS SO STRANGE. (booms) (car alarms blaring) UMM. GOD, WHO AM I KIDDING? YES YES YES YES YES YES. OH, VERY GOOD. - (beeping) - WHAT? (mumbles) (fire crackling) (roaring) (groans) (Gordon screaming) (trumpets) (fire popping) (siren wails) THIS IS A LAWSUIT WAITING TO HAPPEN. IT'S GOT ALL THE PEOPLE EXCITED. Man: HEY, BUD. HOW'D YOUR DATE GO? Man #2: MAN, SHE MADE SPICY TUNA LAST NIGHT. TUNA? SHE'S MAKING YOU TUNA? YEAH. HEY, NOT SO MUCH CREAM IN MY COFFEE. HOW'S IT GOING? - Man: WHERE'S THE SHERIFF? - Man #2: THE SHERIFF'S OFF SOMEWHERE. - Man: WHAT? - HE SAID WE CAN'T LET NOBODY BACK HERE. Man: HE TOLD YOU TO GO WATCH IT? WELL, BUD, WHY AIN'T YOU WATCHING IT THEN? WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA. I CAN'T HAVE YOU CONTAMINATING A CRIME SCENE, DOC. CRIME SCENE? I'M CONDUCTING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT HAPPENED HERE. STANDARD PROCEDURE, FRANK. WELL, SHERIFF, A METEOR HIT THE BUILDING. WELL, JUDGING BY THE AMOUNT OF ASH ON THE GROUND, IT MUST HAVE INCINERATED MY MAMMOTH ON IMPACT. YOU MEAN LIKE WHEN YOU DROP AN ICE CUBE INTO A CUP OF COFFEE AND IT GOES KABLOOEY? YEAH. YEAH, SURE. HEY LOOK, I REALLY-- I PROBABLY SHOULD DO SOME TESTS FIRST - TO CONFIRM MY THEORY. - AFTER THE INVESTIGATION. - OH. - SOMEBODY STOLE IT. - A 17-TON MAMMOTH IN A BLOCK OF ICE? - YEAH. PEOPLE PULL HOAXES ALL THE TIME WITH CROP CIRCLES. YEAH, LIKE THAT GUY IN OREGON WITH THEM BIGFOOT PRINTS. - RAY WALLACE. - THAT'S THE ONE. OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING? AND YOU, YOU MAKE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. I MEAN, IT IS LIKE THE BLIND LEADING THE STUPID HERE. DEPUTIES... PLEASE ESCORT THE GOOD DOCTOR TO HIS VEHICLE. WHOA WHOA, HOLD ON. HOLD ON, OKAY? THIS IS MY MUSEUM. AND THIS IS MY TOWN. I'LL EXPECT YOUR STATEMENT - TOMORROW MORNING, FIRST THING. - OKAY. WELL, EXPECT TO SEE ME THEN! OKAY, TAKE CARE. - THANK YOU, DOC. - Frank: I'LL BE BACK. (engine running) THAT'S FISHY. OKAY OKAY, BACK ON TRACK. JACK WILL UNDERSTAND. I MEAN, THERE'S A GOOD EXCUSE AFTER ALL. ANY OF YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND SHERIFF MARION MORRISON? DEPENDS. WHO'S ASKING? I'M SPECIAL AGENT POWERS. THIS IS MY PARTNER, SPECIAL AGENT WHITAKER. WE'RE HERE TO ASSESS THE SITUATION. AND JUST WHAT IS YOUR JURISDICTION? EARTH. - (chatting) - Bud: YOU THINK SHE-- SHH, I'M TRYING TO READ THEIR LIPS. (electronic humming) IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT HOW SEXY-LOOKING THAT DEPUTY IS. - (chuckling) - WANTING TO GIVE HIM A FULL INSPECTION. GOOD GOOD, WHICH ONE IS SHE TALKING TO? ME? NOT HER-- HIM. NOT FUNNY. THIS IS WORSE THAN I THOUGHT. Both: SHE'S HOT. YOU TWO GOT SOMETHING GOING ON I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT? Both: NO, SIR. (Morrison whispers) TELL THEM NOTHING. - YES, SIR. - SHERIFF. WE'RE GONNA NEED A RECORD OF EVERYTHING LEADING UP TO THE EVENT. NOTHING MOVES. IS THAT CLEAR? CLEAR AS MUD. - IS THERE A PROBLEM, SHERIFF? - OKAY. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES? ONE. - THE DEAD SECURITY GUARD. - Morrison: NO. (swallows) FRANK ABERNATHY. I KNOW I'M LATE, BUT THIS METEOR PRETTY MUCH INCINERATED THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF MY LIFE. BUT HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? (chuckles) ENOUGH ABOUT ME. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HONEY. HOW WAS YOUR DAY? DON'T BE SUCH A FRANK, FRANK. JUST TELL HER THE TRUTH. MY CAR! THE CAR BROKE DOWN, AND THEN MY PHONE WOULDN'T WORK. POOR GORDON. (mimics explosion) HE CAME IN AND HE SAID, "DO YOU WANNA PLAY CHESS?" YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE, FRANK ABERNATHY? YOU SOUND LIKE A DIMWIT. YOU SOUND LIKE A BIRDBRAIN. BIRDBRAIN! 16th BIRTHDAY. DRIVER'S LICENSE. FRANK ABERNATHY, YOU'RE BAD. YOU MESSED UP. IT WAS A BIG DAY AND YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE. IT WAS A BIG DAY. VIOLA. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? Jack: IT'S YOUR CAR. Simon: NOT ANYMORE. KLAATU BELONGS TO YOU. (chuckles) WELL, BIRTHDAY GIRL, WHAT'S THE VERDICT? - I CAN'T TAKE YOUR CAR. - YES, YOU CAN. THANK YOU. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. (tires screech) HONEY, I AM SO SORRY. I-- LOOK. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS THAT-- LOOK, IT'S A REALLY GOOD EXCUSE. OKAY, SO HOW BIG IS THAT ON THE JACK TEMPER SCALE? - 11. - SO WHAT SHOULD I DO? STOP BEING A WEENIE. DON'T SAY "WEENIE." (girl laughing) Woman's voice: DO YOU WANNA TRY MOMMY'S NECKLACE, BABY? HERE. YEAH. IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU. Young Jack: PLEASE CAN I HAVE IT? Woman: ONE DAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK, DADDY? GOOD IDEA. - JACK! - (gasps) AHH! (groaning) GET IN HERE! WERE YOU SPYING ON ME AGAIN? I CAME TO SEE IF YOU WERE MOBILE YET. (chuckles) (keys jingling) COOL. (laughs) CHECK IT OUT. E-VASION? IT COULD BE FUN, BUT I DON'T KNOW, SQUIRRELS. I GOT THE WHEELS, BUT NO LICENSE. I'LL HAPPILY BE YOUR CHAUFFEUR. COME ON, IT'S A POD PARTY. YOU HANG WITH ME. WE'LL PISS OFF YOUR DAD. IT'S A FRIDAY NIGHT IN BLACKWATER. WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO? BESIDES, IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY. AND YOU DO OWE ME FOR THE HANDS. YOU'RE GONNA GET ME IN SO MUCH TROUBLE. (chuckles) CONSIDER IT A GIFT... FROM THE SQUIRRELS. (yells) OKAY. HERE WE GO. PERFECT. JACK, CAN I COME IN? OKAY. LOOK. JACK, I KNOW TODAY WAS-- IT WAS A BIG DAY, A VERY IMPORTANT DAY. (yelps) MY DAD'S JAG! LOOK, I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT IT'D BE COOL. NEVER SAY I NEVER WANNA SHOW A LADY A GOOD TIME. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. - IF IT AIN'T BROKE, THEN DON'T FIX IT. - BROKEN! - YOU'RE STILL HERE, AREN'T YOU? - PLEASE. WELL, WHY DON'T-- WHY DON'T I COME IN THERE? JACK? (engine starts) (tires screech) DAD! I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?! YOU GAVE HER YOUR CAR WITHOUT TALKING TO ME?! (Simon shouting) TALK TO YOU? FRANK, WHEN IS THERE EVER TIME TO TALK TO YOU? NOBODY CAN TALK TO YOU, BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER HERE! YOU'RE STICKING YOUR HEAD UP SOME ELEPHANT'S ASS! HEY, WHAT I DO AT THE MUSEUM, THE SCIENCE, MY WORK-- IT IS IMPORTANT! AND YOUR DAUGHTER ISN'T IMPORTANT? OH, YOU... I'M GONNA GO FIND MY KID. I'LL GO WITH YOU. ALONE. (static) (alien speaks gibberish) SO, DID YOU-- DID YOU REWIRE THE PHONE IN ONE OF YOUR LITTLE PROJECTS AGAIN? TIME TO JOIN THE LIVING, FRANK. LOOK, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS LITTLE OBSESSION OF YOURS WITH, YOU KNOW, FLYING SAUCERS AND-- WHAT IS IT? --LITTLE GREEN MEN, IT HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT AN EMBARRASSMENT - TO ME MY ENTIRE LIFE. - EMBARRASSMENT? NOW THAT QUALIFIES AS A GENUINE EMOTION. I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU FEELING SOMETHING. DAMN IT, WHAT THE HELL DID I DO WITH MY KEYS? PROBABLY OUT IN THE CAR. DON'T AVOID THE ISSUE. DAD, DAD, DAD. YOU JUST... DON'T GET IT, DO YOU? JACK'S MY DAUGHTER. MM-HMM. I WANTED TO BE THE ONE TO GIVE HER HER CAR. - A HYBRID. - A HYBRID? WELL, NOW THAT'S FORWARD THINKING. NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET THE REST OF YOU GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET IT. I CAN'T TALK TO YOU. Powers and Whitaker: MR. ABERNATHY? Both: YES? FRANK ABERNATHY. WELL, THAT WOULD BE ME. AND FOR THE RECORD-- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT IT'S "DOCTOR." SORRY ABOUT THAT, DOC. WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THIS AFTERNOON AT THE MUSEUM. YOU MAY HAVE WITNESSED SOMETHING... UNUSUAL. WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE? SHOULD WE BE CONTACTING A LAWYER? - DID YOU DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL? - NOT TODAY. THIS WON'T TAKE UP MUCH OF YOUR TIME. WOULD EITHER OF YOU HAVE A WORKING PHONE I COULD USE? - SORRY. - SATELLITE MALFUNCTION HAPPENS EVERY NOW AND THEN. - WHAT HAPPENED AT THE MUSEUM, FRANK? - NOT NOW, DAD. LOOK. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU, IF WE COULD PLEASE DO IT WHILE WE DRIVE. I HAVE A RUNAWAY CHILD. DR. ABERNATHY, WE WORK UNDER ORDERS DIRECTLY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. WE DON'T HANDLE DOMESTIC ISSUES. - NEITHER DOES THE WHITE HOUSE. - DO EITHER OF YOU HAVE KIDS? LET ME ENLIGHTEN YOU. IF YOU HAVE A BOY, YOU ONLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ONE... WEINER. YOU HAVE A GIRL, YOU WORRY-- NO, YOU DO-- YOU WORRY ABOUT EVERY WEINER IN THE HOT DOG CART. - OKAY, WOULD YOU TRUST A KID NAMED SQUIGGLY? - SQUIRRELLY. - HE'S A NICE KID. - THANK YOU, MY POINT IS-- DAD, DROP IT, OKAY? I WOULD BE HAPPY TO FINISH THIS CONVERSATION IN THE CAR, OR YOU CAN COME BACK TOMORROW. IT'S YOUR CHOICE. YEAH, LET'S GO. - GOOD. - UH UH UH. FRANK-FRAY, ONT-PAY RUST-FRAY OVERMENT-FRAY... UH... AUF WIEDERSEHEN, UM... - WHAT? - Powers: HE SAID, "FRANK, DON'T TRUST THESE GOVERNMENT STOOGES," IN PIG LATIN. - DOES HE SUFFER FROM DEMENTIA? - I WISH. Simon: TRY NOT TO GET HER PREGNANT ON THE FIRST DATE, SON. (chuckles) OKAY, SEE YOU LATER, DAD. THANKS FOR COMING BY. Bud: HEY D, THIS DEAD GUY LOOKS JUST LIKE GORDON. WELL, MAYBE THEY'RE RELATED, BUD. NO NO, NOT LIKE THAT. HE LOOKS LIKE HE HAD HIS INSIDES SUCKED OUT HIS NOSE OR SOMETHING. THIS LOOKS LIKE TAVEN'S COOKING. SHERIFF SAID WE'D SEE SOMETHING PECULIAR OUT HERE TONIGHT. - WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? - SHUT UP. HEY, BUD, CHECK IT OUT. THIS IS PRETTY ELABORATE FOR A HOAX. YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO KEEP THESE SHOTGUNS? DEFINITELY. Bud: HOW LONG YOU THINK THIS THING'LL GO FOR? Dino: HOW THE HELL WOULD I KNOW, BUD? - I DON'T KNOW. HEY, D? - WHAT? DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY SPIDERS OUT HERE? (Dino laughs) YOU'RE AFRAID OF SPIDERS! SO? - (mockingly) SO? - SHUT UP. Dino: I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T AFRAID OF ANYTHING. I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING. (mockingly) I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING BUT SPIDERS. - (rumbling) - YOU HEAR THAT? (splashes) NO, BUT I SMELL IT. OH, HOLD ON! OH HELL! OH MY GOD! - OH HO HO. - (laughing) OH, THESE ARE NEW SHOES. WELL, YOU'RE RIDING IN THE BACK, BUD. NO WAY. YOU RIDE BACK THERE. I'M DRIVING. I'M NOT RIDING IN THE BACK. THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE DRIVING WITH SPUNK ALL OVER SHOES. - THIS CRAP AIN'T SPUNK. - SAME DIFFERENCE. - HEY, IS THAT A SPIDER ON YOUR HEAD? - NO. - (laughs) - (mammoth trumpeting) - WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? - (stomping) (gasps) - HEAR THAT? - HELL, I FELT THAT. MOTHER OF GOD! (trumpeting) (both screaming) - Man: WHOO-HOO! - (techno music playing) HEY. YEAH, LOOK AT THIS MADNESS. Jack: IT'S CRAZY, THAT'S FOR SURE. Squirrelly: THIS IS SO COOL. LOOK AT THESE GUYS. WHAT'S UP, GUYS? HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JACK. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JACK. IT'S COOL, RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, BIRTHDAY GIRL. READY TO BLAST OFF INTO OUR OWN PARTY? FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE. FOLLOW ME. I'D FOLLOW YOU ANYWHERE. CAN YOU TELL US IF THE MAMMOTH DIED - BEFORE OR AFTER IT WAS FROZEN? - (beeping) THE SECOND ONE. IT WAS, YOU KNOW, FROZEN ALIVE AND SUBSEQUENTLY DIED AS A RESULT. OH, RIGHT RIGHT! RIGHT, RIGHT THERE. RIGHT, YEAH. GOD, THERE WERE JUST SO MANY MORE THINGS THAT WE COULD HAVE LEARNED FROM HIM. WHAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR DO THEY TYPICALLY EXHIBIT IN THE WILD? WE BELIEVE THEY ACTED VERY SIMILAR TO MODERN-DAY ELEPHANTS. DO THEY ATTACK? OH, SURE, BUT MOSTLY OUT OF DEFENSE. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE NEED TO KNOW? WELL, THEY WERE HERBIVORES. - HERBIVORES. THE "H" IS SILENT. - HERBIVORES. Frank: WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? YOU DON'T JUST SHOW UP ON MY DOORSTEP TO CATCH UP ON YOUR MAMMOTH 101. - HE'S THE EXPERT. - RULE NUMBER ONE. IF WE WANT HIM TO HELP US, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LET HIM KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. RULE NUMBER TWO: REPEAT RULE NUMBER ONE. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO FILL IN THE GAP HERE AT ANY TIME. THE METEOR CROSSED OVER FORT PETRIE AIR FORCE BASE JUST PRIOR TO STRIKING YOUR MUSEUM, DR. ABERNATHY. - BUT THAT'S IN MISSISSIPPI. - EXACTLY. IT WAS FIRST TRACKED COMING IN FROM THE NORTHEAST, BUT IT HIT THE MUSEUM COMING IN FROM THE SOUTH. YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE METEOR HAD NAVIGATIONAL CAPABILITIES, ARE YOU? A U.F.O.? MY DAD IS GONNA HAVE A FIELD DAY WITH THIS ONE. THAT'S JUST WEIRD. SOMEBODY'S HIDING SOMETHING. NO TV EITHER. JUST LIKE THE PHONE. SOMEBODY'S BEEN PLAYING WITH THE POWER GRID. HEY. HEY! CHECK THAT ASS. Man: GOOD EYES, DUDE. - GO GET US SOMETHING. - YEAH, GO. JERK. JESUS! (grunts) WHAT IS YOUR DEAL? - PISS OFF, JACKASS. - WHAT? - NO NO NO NO. - Squirrelly: JACK! JACK, COME ON. THOSE GUYS WERE JERKS. WANT ME TO TAKE YOU HOME? THAT'S THE LAST PLACE I WANNA GO RIGHT NOW. COME ON. THE NIGHT'S STILL YOUNG. LOOK, I'M KIND OF FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M SURE I COULD SCORE US A COUPLE OF BURGERS AT LEE'S. YOU'RE REALLY SWEET. YOU KNOW THAT? - SWEET? - YEAH. WHAT? YOU ARE. (chuckles) THANK YOU, BUT... I WAS GOING FOR THE MORE IRRESISTIBLE THING. Man: YO! CHILL. EVERYTHING'S COOL, GUYS. Man: EVERYTHING'S NOT COOL. (groaning) Man #3: HIT HIM AGAIN! (mammoth groaning, stomping) WHA-- WHAT'S THAT? (trumpeting) WATCH OUT! EITHER OF YOU SEE "NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD"? - NO, I DON'T LIKE THOSE MOVIES. - YEAH, NEITHER DO I, BUT IT LOOKED A LOT LIKE THIS. STOP! JACK? WHAT HAPPENED, SWEETHEART? HERE YOU GO. HERE YOU GO. RIGHT HERE. HERE... WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE, DID YOU TAKE SOMETHING? HUH? WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO MY DAUGHTER? I SWEAR TO GOD, IF YOU GAVE HER THE WEED, I WILL NEUTER YOU! MR. ABERNATHY, - YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT WE'VE SEEN. - DAD. - (stomping approaching) - YEAH BABY, WHAT IS IT? I'M RIGHT HERE. TALK TO ME. HMM? (whispers) BEHIND YOU. (mammoth trumpets) OH MY GOD. OH, GOD. (breathing heavily) OH, YOU ARE ONE BIG HAIRY MAGNIFICENT BASTARD. OH, GOD! OKAY, LET'S BACK UP. LET'S MOVE IT BACK. NO SUDDEN MOVEMENTS. LET'S JUST REMAIN CALM. OKAY, THAT'S-- THERE YOU GO. MY GOD, LOOK AT YOU. LOOK AT YOU. NO NO NO NO! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! THIS COULD BE THE SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON OF THE MILLENNIUM! (growls) (trumpeting) GET THEM OUT OF HERE! OH, GOD! OH, GOD! (mammoth inhaling) JACK, COME ON! COME ON! HURRY! Squirrelly: YOUR DAD IS STOPPING. YOUR DAD IS STOPPING! MR. ABERNATHY, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? RUN! Frank: GO, GO! KEEP GOING! Squirrelly: JACK, JACK! COME ON, HURRY! DAD! - (screams) - NO! GET DOWN, SQUIRRELLY. GET DOWN! HEY! HEY, BUDDY! WOO! RIGHT HERE! HEY! (trumpets) OH! OH, GOD! (whispering) SQUIRRELLY? DAD? WHERE ARE YOU? (whispers) DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD. WHOA. OH OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO? GO BACK TO THE CAR. - BUT THAT'S CRAZY. - THAT'S CRAZY. I DON'T KNOW, I THINK THAT'S A REAL SOLID OPTION. - AT LEAST FOR ME IT'S VERY BIG, IT'S-- - OKAY. - IT'S THIS WAY? - Powers: FRANK! OKAY OKAY, LET'S GO! COME ON! COME ON, COME ON. HURRY! I WAS HIGH WHEN I WROTE THIS SONG... (woman moaning) AND I WANT YOU TO SING ALONG NO ONE CAN EVER KNOW HOW OUR LOVE WILL GROW AND GROW. (moaning) (both moaning) (mammoth stomps) HUH? STOP BEING SO SKITTISH. DON'T TELL ME YOU DIDN'T FEEL THAT. THAT NEVER STOPPED ME BEFORE. COME ON, BEFORE WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE HOME. (both moaning) (stomping) Man: GOOD LORD, WOMAN. SHH, OFF ME. I KNOW YOU KNOCKING, I KNOW YOU KNOCKING. (trumpeting) OKAY, YOU GUYS, GET IN THE CAR. FRANK, GET THE BODY. - WHAT? - Powers: HURRY UP. HURRY UP! WILL YOU HELP ME WITH THIS PLEASE? I GOT IT. LET ME DO THIS FOR YOU. - LET ME DO THIS FOR YOU. - FRANK! COME ON. OKAY, ONE, TWO, THREE! (both groan) GOD, IS HE HEAVY. WE'LL STUFF HIM AT THE MORGUE. YOU HAVE A MORGUE, RIGHT? OH YEAH, THERE'S TWO. MY FATHER'S VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH A MORTICIAN. - PUSH DOWN ON HIS FEET. - NO, THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT HIS FEET. GET OUT OF THE WAY. WHAT ABOUT THE HEAD? LEAVE IT. - ARE YOU SURE? - YOU DRIVE. OKAY. OKAY. REALLY? LET'S GO. METEORS DON'T ALTER COURSE. IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE? SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING BUT THE LIGHTS? SOMEBODY CALLED HOME! ALL RIGHTY, TIME TO PAY THE BILLS. (clears throat) HAPPY BIRTHDAY. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. LET ME SEE HERE. "BONITA TERRACE, 6864." MOTHER EF-ER. JESUS, WHY DON'T THEY JUST - PUT THE NUMBERS WHERE YOU CAN SEE THEM? - (stomping) (growling) (thudding) HMM. SOMEONE GRABBED MY ANTENNA. (mammoth trumpets in distance) MONKEYS? MONKEYS FROM OUTER SPACE. IS THIS AN INVASION? OH MY GOD. IT'S AN INVASION. OVERPROTECTIVE? MY FATHER WAS TOO. THEN I'M NOT PROTECTIVE ENOUGH. I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR PARTNER. HE SEEMED LIKE A VERY NICE GUY. YOU SAW IT, RIGHT? THE REGENERATION? - YEAH. - I STUDIED THE FOSSIL RECORDS-- SPECIFICALLY THAT THING OUT THERE-- FOR THE BETTER PART OF FIVE YEARS. X-RAYS, CAT SCANS, RADIO-CARBON DATING-- I CAN PRETTY MUCH TELL YOU WHAT ITS LAST MEAL WAS. BUT NONE, AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE, EXHIBITED BEHAVIOR OF THAT KIND. - YEAH. - IT WAS FEEDING. FEEDING, SUSTENANCE. - THEN WE CAN KILL IT. - OKAY, WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. I'M GONNA GET MY DAD AND GET THE HELL OUT OF DODGE. DR. ABERNATHY, YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION WE HAVE HERE. IT SEEMS PRETTY EASY FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND. BIG MONSTER ON LOOSE, - LEAVE TOWN AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. - THAT IS NOT AN OPTION. THAT'S HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE LEFT UNTIL THE AUTO-PROTOCOL'S INITIATED. WHEN THAT CLOCK HITS ZERO, IF WE HAVEN'T FOUND A WAY TO CONTAIN OR DESTROY THAT CREATURE, THEN THIS TOWN IS GONNA BE BLASTED OUT OF EXISTENCE. LADY, YOU'RE SCARING ME. Powers: YOU SHOULD BE SCARED. WHY? BECAUSE THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION VIEWS THESE TYPES OF THREATS AS-- WELL, LET'S JUST SAY THEY DON'T SIT WELL WITH THE VOTERS. YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT? DO I LOOK LIKE I'M KIDDING? NO. I'M THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE, FRANK. AND I NEED YOUR HELP. I'M NO HERO. HEROES AREN'T MADE, FRANK. THEY'RE CORNERED. OKAY. OKAY. IF WE'RE GONNA KILL THIS THING. WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME HELP. SON'S KEYS IN THE CAR. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT, HUH? LET'S GO TO TOWN. Powers: EVENING, GENTLEMEN. SPACE PATROL. WANNA TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THAT METEORITE? - ROUTINE INVESTIGATION, MA'AM. - (grunts) Powers: HEY, BE CAREFUL WITH THAT! - Frank: READY? - Powers: HEY, DON'T! IT'S MY PARTNER. OKAY. WHAT DID I MISS? (whispering) NOT A WORD. - MAYBE WE SHOULD TELL THEM. - FLOYD. JEEZ, MARION, WE'RE IN OVER OUR HEADS ON THIS. Powers: IF YOU TWO KNOW SOMETHING, YOU'D BETTER SPILL IT NOW. FOLLOW US. I SAID WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE. - I DID. - Morrison: WHO CARES? - WHAT IS THIS PLACE? - Floyd: DEEP FREEZE. POPSICLE, ANYONE? SUIT YOURSELF. WHAT YOU TASTE IS WHAT YOU SMELL. BEATS FORMALDEHYDE. (whispers) THAT'S A LITTLE SCIENCE HUMOR. - OH, BOY. - IT'S A HAND. A DEAD HAND. "DEAD" IS RELATIVE. POPCORN SETTING. IT TAKES ABOUT A MINUTE. NOW THAT IS FASCINATING, YET CREEPY AT THE SAME TIME. I THINK IT'S TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING. - (tapping continues) - WHAT IS IT SAYING? I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT FOR 30 YEARS. (stammering) I'M GONNA WANNA EXAMINE THE HAND. - IT CAN BE PRETTY NASTY. - THANKS. HOW DID YOU GET THIS? - A DONATION. - (gasps) (dings) HEY, GET-- YOU LITTLE...! (muttering) GIVE ME-- COME HERE. HEY! HEY! - (gasps) - Frank: OH, GOD. OH! THAT'S HANDY. I USE A PHONE BOOK. (whirring, beeping) IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF. (beeps) WHATEVER'S INSIDE THIS HAND, IT'S THE SAME THING INSIDE THE MAMMOTH. Floyd: EVERYTHING INDICATES FREEZING WON'T KILL IT. IT JUST GOES INTO SUSPENDED ANIMATION. Powers: YOU TWO SHOULD HAVE REPORTED THIS YEARS AGO. THE GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE STEPPED IN AND FOUND A SOLUTION. Morrison: SURE, WE TELL THEM. THEY COME IN AND USE A LITTLE TERM CALLED "EMINENT DOMAIN." THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, OUR TOWN IS AREA 52 AND WE'RE LEFT WITHOUT A POT TO PISS IN. SORRY, MISS. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE ZOMBIE SOUL-SUCKING EFFECT? MAYBE IT NEEDS THE ORGANIC ENERGY FROM ITS PREY TO SIMPLY MAINTAIN ITS EXISTENCE. MAYBE IT'S A RESCUE MISSION. A RESCUE MISSION. HONEY... YOU'RE A GENIUS! I PULLED THIS OUT OF THE MAMMOTH THIS MORNING. LET ME CHECK THAT OUT. IT'S SOME KIND OF TRANSMITTER OR G.P.S. DEVICE. IT'S PROBABLY HOW THE SPHERE FOUND THE MUSEUM. DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THAT'S INTERGALACTIC ONSTAR? Powers: YEAH WELL, BASICALLY. Jack: WE'RE BEING SEEDED. THIS IS ALL WAY TOO "WAR OF THE WORLDS" FOR ME. I HOPE YOU'RE TALKING THE 1953 ORIGINAL. I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF THE REMAKE. ONE CAN ARGUE "THE BODY SNATCHERS," BUT IT'S REALLY EVEN CLOSER TO "THE BLOB"-- THE ORIGINAL THAT IS. THIS IS GREAT. MY DAUGHTER'S TURNING INTO MY FATHER. THAT AIN'T SO BAD, FRANK. SHE COULD WIND UP MORE LIKE YOU. - (beeps) - OKAY. SO SAY WE CAN USE THE TRANSMITTER TO LURE THE CREATURE TO US. HOW DO WE FREEZE A CREATURE THAT STANDS 13' HIGH AND WEIGHS 17, 18 TONS? MAYBE. MAYBE! (cackling) CARBON DIOXIDE! IT PUTS OUT A FIRE BECAUSE AS THE GAS IS RELEASED, IT EXPANDS, COOLING THE SURROUNDING AREA. NOW, THIS COOLING WILL OFTEN CAUSE ICE TO FORM AROUND THE HORN FROM WHERE THE GAS IS EXPELLED FROM THE EXTINGUISHER. - ICE. MAN, THAT'S GOOD. - YES! SO WHERE DO WE FIND A GIANT FIRE EXTINGUISHER? OH NO NO NO. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE CARBON DIOXIDE. OTHER CHEMICALS HAVE THE SAME EFFECT WHEN RELEASED INTO THE AIR, - LIKE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. - OH, NO NO NO NO, FLOYD. THAT WOULD BE TOO TOXIC. NO, WE NEED SOMETHING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF NO2. - LIQUID NITROGEN. - YES! THE ONLY PLACE AROUND HERE YOU COULD FIND SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE OUT AT THE OLD FACTORY. THEY'VE GOT CHEMICALS. - I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY. - YEAH, MY OLD MAN USED TO WORK OUT THERE. GOD, HE KNEW THAT PLACE LIKE THE BACK OF HIS HAND. SORRY, FLOYD. NO OFFENSE. - NONE TAKEN. - WHAT THE HELL ARE WE WAITING FOR? I MEAN, WE'VE GOT THIS THING'S KRYPTONITE. LET'S GO. - YES! - TIME TO PAY HOMAGE TO OUR ANCESTORS. - THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! - NOT HAPPENING. IF MY DAD SAYS IT'LL WORK, - IT'LL WORK. - CONTAINMENT IS NO LONGER AN OPTION. Frank: WELL, IT IS THE BEST OPTION WE HAVE AFTER WITNESSING THE HAND GOBLIN! COLD-- IT'S ITS ACHILLES' HEEL. NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THE ENTITY IS ALIEN, IT INITIATES A DIFFERENT PROTOCOL. Jack: LADY... YOU ARE SCARING ME. WE CAN'T RISK THE ENTITY GETTING OUT. SO WE CONTAIN IT! GO! LISTEN TO ME. I AM BEGGING YOU! WHATEVER IS INSIDE THAT MAMMOTH, IT NEEDS TO BE RESEARCHED. IT HAS UNSPEAKABLE SCIENTIFIC VALUE. WE WON'T ALLOW THAT. Frank: OKAY, LET'S JUST CUT THE "WE" CRAP. OKAY, THERE IS NO "WE" IN THIS SITUATION. IT'S NOT FOR US TO DECIDE. - DOES SHE MEAN "US" OR "WE"? - I THINK "THEM." CAN I BE FRANK WITH YOU? YOU ARE FRANK. - I KNOW. - (hand tapping) EXCUSE ME. I TOLD YOU I WASN'T KIDDING ABOUT THE PHONE BOOK. DAD, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I NEED A DRINK. - DR. ABERNATHY! - Frank: I DON'T HEAR YOU. FRANK! - GOD, WILL SOMEONE PLEASE TELL HER TO SHUT UP? - FRANK. FRANK. (bell dings) - HI, FRANK. - HEY, LUCE. MILKSHAKES ALL AROUND. NONE FOR HER RIGHT THERE. Luce: UH-HUH. (cell beeping) TIME WAITS FOR NO MAN, FRANK. WELL, IT CAN WAIT FOR ME. YOU'RE PUTTING EVERYONE AT RISK. (chuckles) I'M PUTTING THEM AT RISK. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT, SISTER, AND I WANT EVERYONE HERE TO BE VERY CLEAR ON THE DYNAMICS OF OUR EXACT SITUATION. SCENARIO ONE-- I HELP YOU... KILL THE MAMMOTH. WE SUCCEED, - THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T BLOW US UP. - CORRECT. SCENARIO TWO-- I HELP YOU. WE FAIL, AND IN-- WELL, WHAT IS IT? IT'S A LITTLE LESS THAN 5 HOURS AND 52 MINUTES EVERYONE IN THIS GOOD TOWN IS DEAD. - I DON'T LIKE SCENARIO TWO. - ME NEITHER. Frank: THERE'S MORE. SCENARIO THREE-- WE GO GET MY DAD, AND WE CELEBRATE MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY. AND WE SPEND THE LAST SIX HOURS OF OUR EXISTENCE DOING SOMETHING THAT MATTERS. - AMEN TO THAT. - Frank: THANK YOU. THAT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD DECISION. AT LEAST IT WOULD BE MY DECISION. (sighs) LOOK, IF I AGREE TO DO THIS, TO KILL THE MAMMOTH, I WANT MY FAMILY EVACUATED OUT OF HERE IMMEDIATELY. - THANK YOU, LUCE. - I CAN'T OFFER YOU THAT. WELL, THEN YOU CAN GO TO H-E-DOUBLE-HOCKEY-STICKS. OKAY, LAST CHANCE OR I APPROACH THIS ON MY OWN, A SCENARIO THAT DEFINITELY LOWERS THE ODDS. - HOW MUCH? ARE WE TALKING 10 %, 15 %? - FRANK! I NEED TO SPEAK WITH MY DAUGHTER. SWEETIE? COME OVER HERE. SIT DOWN. LOOK, THERE'S SOME STUFF THAT I'VE BEEN WANTING TO-- NO, THIS IS STUFF THAT I NEED TO SAY TO YOU. I GUESS... THIS IS WHY YOU WERE LATE TODAY. OH, YEAH. I'M SORRY I ACTED THE WAY I DID. NO, FORGET IT. I MEAN, YOU HAD EVERY RIGHT. I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE FOR YOU. I... I'VE BEEN HIDING. LOOK, I KNOW WORDS DON'T SEEM TO MEAN TOO MUCH RIGHT NOW, BUT I JUST-- I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M PROUD OF YOU. AND I KNOW IF YOUR MOM WERE STILL HERE, SHE WOULD BE PROUD OF YOU TOO. EVER SINCE YOUR MOM DIED, I'VE BEEN OVERPROTECTIVE OF YOU. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING: AFTER TODAY, THE ONE THING I KNOW IS YOU'RE TOUGH... JUST LIKE SHE WAS. MAYBE EVEN TOUGHER. WHICH IS WHY... I WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS ON YOUR BIRTHDAY. IT'S MOM'S. YEAH, I GAVE IT TO HER WHEN WE FIRST MET. I THINK IT'S TIME YOU WEAR IT. NOW... HEY. IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY. TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO HERE. "RIDE THE TEMPEST. TAME THE WAVES, KILL THE SHARKS." - WHAT? - IT'S A QUOTE, DAD. THE VIETNAMESE JOAN OF ARC. OH. OH, RIGHT, OF COURSE IT IS. I'M GLAD I SENT YOU TO THAT PRIVATE SCHOOL. OKAY, EVERYBODY! IF YOU DON'T WANNA HELP, I SUGGEST YOU HOLD UP HERE. THEY SAY YOU HAVEN'T REALLY LIVED UNLESS YOU'VE LOOKED DEATH IN THE FACE. I GUESS I'M GONNA LIVE FOREVER THEN. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET YOU OUT OF THERE. Frank: DAD? - DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - WHOA. THE MONKEY'S A GUY. UM, RIGHT. WE HAVE AN ALIEN-POSSESSED MAMMOTH ON THE LOOSE, AND IF WE DON'T STOP IT, THE GOVERNMENT IS GONNA KILL ALL OF US. (laughing) THAT'S CUTE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE SERIOUS? I'M SERIOUS. I DON'T KNOW QUITE WHAT TO DO. WHAT WOULD PATRICK MacNEE DO HERE? HE'D LET EMMA PEEL DRIVE. HERE YOU GO. Frank: THIS EMMA PEEL, PATRICK MacNEE THING-- I JUST-- I DON'T GET IT. Powers: OBVIOUSLY YOU NEVER WATCHED "THE AVENGERS." Jack: WHERE DID THEY GO? Simon: DON'T WORRY. I KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. TELL ME ABOUT THIS MAMMOTH. (trumpets) SEE FOR YOURSELF. HANG ON! - WHAT? - WE'RE ON EMPTY. Squirrelly: WHAT? Morrison over radio: Frank, I think we've got a problem. Where's Jack? Frank: WAIT WAIT. SOMETHING'S WRONG. WE GOTTA GO BACK. - WHAT? - WE GOTTA GO BACK! OKAY. YOU TWO JUST STAY HERE, ALL RIGHT? TAKE THIS. KEEP AN EYE OUT. I'M SCARED, SQUIRREL. I'M REALLY SCARED. EVEN EMMA HAS A BAD DAY EVERY NOW AND THEN. HELL WITH IT. BUCK NEEDS A NEW KIDNEY. EXCUSE ME! (giggles) WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME. WE'VE GOT A MAMMOTH ON THE LOOSE. WE'VE GOTTA SAVE THE WORLD. YOU STUD. (Squirrelly chuckles) THANKS, SIMON. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? PUT THAT GAS BACK! LADY, I PUT MORE THAN ENOUGH MONEY IN THERE TO REPAIR THAT WINDOW AND TO FILL UP TWO CARS THIS SIZE WITH GASOLINE. (mammoth growling) (stomping) - (trumpets) - (tusk squelches) (screaming) NO! GET IN THE CAR! GET IN THE CAR! GET IN THE CAR! GO! I'M SO SORRY, HONEY. SO SORRY. I THINK I LOVED HIM. I NEVER TOLD HIM. HE KNEW, BABY. HE KNEW. WE'RE NOT GIVING UP, OKAY? IT'S WHAT SQUIRRELLY WOULD HAVE WANTED, RIGHT? OKAY? (tires screech) IS EVERYTHING OKAY? SQUIRRELLY... OH. (sighs) "RIDE THE TEMPEST." HE'LL BE WATCHING US. LOOK, UMM... NOT 100 % SURE THIS IS GONNA WORK, BUT HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT PICKING UP SOME NITROGEN OVER AT THE OLD FERTILIZER PLANT AND MEETING US AT THE FACTORY? - ARE YOU CRAZY? - MAYBE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? ARE YOU WITH ME? YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. HEAD DOWN, STAY OUT OF SIGHT, OKAY? - YEAH. - SIMON'S ON HIS WAY. WELL, HE'D BETTER BE, BECAUSE IF THIS THING WON'T GO DOWN IN A BLAZE OF GLORY, WE'RE GONNA NEED A HELL OF A LOT OF JUICE - TO SEND IT BACK TO THE ICE AGE. - (grunts) (gunshot) GENTLEMEN... MA'AM, THE GREAT STATE OF LOUISIANA NEEDS YOUR HELP. TAKE IT BACK... AND UP! THESE WON'T STOP THE MAMMOTH, BUT THEY'LL DEFINITELY GIVE HIM A PUSH IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. DEMOTED FROM SHERIFF TO RODEO CLOWN IN A FEW SHORT HOURS. I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT WORD GETTING OUT. - ARE YOU ALWAYS THIS CHEERFUL? - IT'S ONE OF MY GOOD DAYS. VERY GOOD. HMM? (stomping approaches) (screaming) - Man: IT'S COMING! - Man #2: WHAT IS THAT? HELP ME OUT OF HERE! GET ME OUT OF HERE! LET'S GET GOING! MOVE IT, MOVE IT! (screams) - GOTTA GET OUT! - (trumpeting) (man #3 screams) (screams) IT'S COMING YOUR WAY! FRY THE BASTARD. (trumpeting) Morrison: SON OF A BITCH. DEAR GOD. GOD IS FOR SUNDAY, FRANK. TODAY WE PRAY TO NIKE. RUN! (Morrison screams) KEEP RUNNING! DON'T STOP! (stomping) (trumpeting) WOULD YOU MIND? YOU'VE GOT THE GUN AND EVERYTHING. - (groans) - YEAH. GOOD JOB. OKAY, WATCH YOUR STEP. YEAH. OH, WAIT. THERE THEY ARE RIGHT THERE. THOSE VALVES. RIGHT THERE. THEY CONTROL THE STEAM AND AIRFLOW. YOU KNOW, FOR ADDING CATALYZERS TO THE STEEL TO QUANTIFY TENSILE STRENGTH. DAD... BASIC ENGLISH. OH RIGHT, YEAH. WELL, ESSENTIALLY WHATEVER GOES IN THE SYSTEM WILL COME OUT OF THE CHAMBER UNLESS WE CHOOSE TO SEAL IT OFF. YOU MEAN NITROGEN. YEAH, WELL, THAT'S ALL WE HAVE UNTIL SIMON COMES BACK. - OH, HE'LL COME BACK. - HE'LL COME BACK? YES. VERY NEGATIVE. ALL RIGHT, WELL, ALL WE HAVE LEFT TO DO IS INVITE HIM IN. - (trumpeting) - COME ON, THIS WAY! COME ON, THIS WAY! RUN! WAIT ONE SECOND. MOVE IT, MOVE IT, MOVE IT! - WE'D BETTER DO IT FAST. - Man: NO, IT'S COMING! WHAT IS THAT? WHERE'S YOUR DAUGHTER? (trumpeting) HEY, OVER HERE, YOU BASTARD! COME ON! FOLLOW ME! COME ON! HEY! Powers: JACK! GET OUT OF THERE, JACK! (banging) SIMON HAD BETTER SHOW. (truck honking) (banging continues) (trumpeting) (honks) (honks) I KNEW IT! COME ON. THE BIG GUY'S IN THE TRAP, BUT HE WANTS OUT. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME. AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU CAME UP WITH PLAN B? - OKAY, MISS, I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS... - OKAY. ...AND CONNECT IT RIGHT THERE. THAT'S IT. WHEN I CALL FOR THE MAMMOTH JUICE, ALL RIGHT, I'LL SIGNAL. I'M ALL SET! HOW ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE? MOVE IT! OKAY, LET'S GO. WE'RE GOOD TO GO. FLIP THE SWITCH! Simon: DAMN IT. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE VALVE! (grunts) OKAY, SIMON, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. (Simon screaming) - STAY BACK! DON'T GET ANY CLOSER. - Jack: WHAT'S GOING ON? THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE RELEASE VALVES. THE SEAL IS BROKEN. I'M GONNA HAVE TO TURN IT MANUALLY. THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE 100 BELOW IN LESS THAN A MINUTE. - NOW GET JACK AND GO! - WE WON'T LEAVE YOU, GRANDPA! - JACK, LET'S GO. - Simon: GO! - JACK! - Jack: NO, WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM! - GET HER OUT OF HERE NOW! - Jack: DAD, MAKE HIM STOP! - LET'S GO NOW! IT'S OVER. - Jack: WE'RE NOT LEAVING HIM BEHIND! THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO FOR SIMON. LET'S MOVE IT. NO! NO! - HURRY UP! - SHUT UP! DAD! HOCKEY STICKS. (trumpeting) (yells) (beeping) Jack: SO HE'S COMPLETELY FINE? Woman: HE'S ALIVE AND IN PERFECT HIBERNATION. ALL VITAL SIGNS ARE GOOD. Jack: "EMPIRE STRIKES BACK" ALWAYS WAS ONE OF HIS FAVORITE MOVIES. SO WHEN WILL WE BE ABLE TO GET HIM OUT OF THERE? WELL, THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THAT FAR OFF. I'D SAY ABOUT THE TIME JACK'S HIS AGE. OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE SOME FRIENDS THAT ARE WORKING IN THE CRYOGENICS FIELD. YOU KNOW, I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS. I'LL GIVE YOU GUYS SOME TIME. THANK YOU. DON'T WORRY, JACK. HE'LL BE BACK. Powers: AS LONG AS HE STAYS FROZEN, THE ENTITY CAN NEVER ESCAPE. THEN WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE SURE OF THAT, WON'T WE? Powers: WHAT ABOUT THE ABERNATHYS? Man: GIVE THEM THE ELEPHANT. Woman: THE PLEISTOCENE MUSEUM WAS FOUNDED IN 1879 HERE IN BLACKWATER, LOUISIANA, BY ARMAND KAVORKIAN. THERE'S A POLAR BEAR FROM BACK THEN. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HERE WE HAVE THE PLEISTOCENE MUSEUM'S PRIDE AND JOY. IS THIS THE SAME MAMMOTH THAT CAME TO LIFE? Woman: WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ IN "THE WEEKLY WORLD SPECTACULAR." BUT YES, IT'S THE SAME MAMMOTH. ALTHOUGH THEY LIVED IN THE ICE AGE, THE MAMMOTHS ARE THE RELATIVES TO OUR MODERN-DAY ELEPHANTS. THIS MAMMOTH WAS AN ADOLESCENT WHEN IT DIED. YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE ITS FUR ISN'T QUITE THAT LONG YET. DO YOU ALL HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MAMMOTH? Director: CUT CUT CUT CUT CUT! WHO THE HELL TOOK THE PHASER OFF OF STUN? (dramatic music playing)
