- What is it boy? - It is a packet, granny! - Who kept this here? - I don't know! - What is it? - Feac... Keep quiet! Do we have brazen people in our place to do this? When I went to supply milk at Lonappan's place this morning... I saw Bakery Mathai ducking here... - Could it be him? - Not likely! Ma'am, praise the Lord! What is that golden covered packet? Feaces! Is it pork meat? Make pickled pig's knuckles! It would be splendid! Ma. an." Can't you figure out what it is? Feaces! When did Mathai pack this and left it there! He even asked ma'am if it is pork meat? He told her to make pig knuckles and consume it! I would make him eat it! Get me two teak leaves! - What is it Chachappa? - Few fishes Thangamma! It is moray eel! Would be great for fish gravy! Is it a backwater catch? No, it is baited from the toilet! Thresy! ls the stove hot? It is moray eel! If we don't heat it up... ...it would become difficult to peel them! From where did you get moray eel? Chachappan brought it You prepare for the gravy! My God! Mathai! Salvage our family esteem! Chachappa! What happened? Sir! This beggar hurled faeces in my house! Sir! This fellow gave faeces to my mom saying it is moray eel! 'Police Station' Stop it! Don't come to my station with such faecal cases! Have you both heard it guys? 'This is also a story of this town!' 'But this is not the story of this town!' "Gilded honey dew fills soul!

Where is solomon? Has he not come? Not only Solomon Shoshanna has also not come! Some other girls are singing the prayer choir! I did everything possible! In the name of the Lord and the Holy spirit! Amen! Give him a slap What is it, dad? You will not allow me to even sleep! The entire parish is inside the church Like a pig in the mire you are crouched here! Umpteen times I have told you not to lie like this! It is because I have fever dad! Mercy Angel! Give him the coffee! - Have you added sugar? - Sufficiently! Drink this and join the mass at the church! You need not have any misgiving! This time I will make you play at least once - What is pricking me? - It is my wings dad! Can't you clip your wings?

Brother! When I started for the church did I not wake you up? Did you sleep again? After you left, I felt little feverish... So I went to bed again! Jesus! Let me see! Like cows defecate this guy gets fever so often! He needs bum whipping! If this is repeated that is sure to happen - It is true mom! - Is it! Dad and his angels gave me coffee and left! Jesus! There is no coffee powder and sugar at home! Then how could dad prepare coffee? Keep quiet, Clara! The angels would have brought coffee powder and sugar! Son! Did dad say anything else? Mom bless me! I am going to play the band tomorrow! Hey! Bless me and go Tomorrow your brother is playing the band! - Are you coming mom? - Go woman! Bye! Saint! For the first time... lam going to play before a gathering! In case I tremble, stay along with me! Solomon! Is this the attire for an helper of the church? Pope told me to join the band today! An helper's job in church is not playing the clarinet! Those who did not take part in new year prayer... ...need not play in church band! Please don't talk like that, Father! I informed everyone that I would play the band tomorrow! Don't look at him! Gee Varghese band expenses are not borne by the pope It is borne by the church! Church may bear the band expenses! But it is me who decide who should play in the band! I am a vicar in this parish for the last 15 years! All these years the church band has lost everywhere! I believe Thomas's contention is do not accept anything... ...until seen by your own eyes! Why are you creating an issue Father? Is it because we asked him to play? More than this guy he has all the credentials... ...to play for the church band He is the son of Esthappan master! A person is not selected for band... ...based on his dad's name and his lineage! Have you heard him play? You may play now! Let me hear you! No sound is coming from this! Has someone packed cloth inside? Father...! Come on play man! When you suddenly asked me to play... Are you going to play in toilets? Come on play, man! May man! First learn to ring the bell and make frankincense Try to become a sacristan! Remove the shirt and give it to the pope! Must be at the church at 5 AM... ...and ring the bell for the first mass! Leelamma! Keep this at the Kitchen! Kamalahasan engineer bought this! On the other bank today it is Davi's band! It is impressive Leelamma! Is it grilled breast or duck roast? Leelamma, you didn't answer me! Engineer sir! What is that you want? You take it home I will answer him! Kamalahassan Engineer! This is not meant for today! For tonight all creatures living in water and land... ...are cooked and the curries are swanked on table! The only one left out is the cow in the cowshed! Shall I cut the cow's udder and make pickles for you? - What are you talking? - How else can I answer him? Engineer sir! He was just joking! Come on sir Climb up sir! I thought... Matha! That guy Solomon who is after this girl... ...stitched shirts for band and went upstairs Will the Father allow him? Instantly he drove him out Dad! Don't talk ill of Solomon! I would splash chilli water on your face! Who is Solomon for you? Shall I serve you a cutlet? Did you not hear me? Who is Solomon for you? I am going to marry him He is my groom What have you done Mathacha? Coddle her! You pampered her and now... Wash the face! - Mom! - Stay there! Are you going to kill her? Mom! I was... - Mathacha! She has fainted! - I will be back now! Binamma! Serve little buffalo meat! My god! Mom... Binamma! Get some water soon! coming! My God! What happened to you? Binamma, get some water - I just enacted a scene! - Water! I just tested if my son still has affection for me! This is queer! What are you looking at? Get me two pieces of duck meat and one appam! - This is excessive! - Are you a big... Let me go to bed! Granny! When I mentioned your name... ...yesterday my uncle was about to kill me I don't think I can hold out any longer! You are bothered about your problems only I yearn to play in the band! When Father asked me to play... ...I trembled He drove me out The other guy is now wearing the shirt stitched for me! If you couldn't play there then you are unsuitable! You play standing beneath my window Why are you not able to play before a gathering? You know everything! Yet should you say this? When I hold the clarinet before a gathering... ...I get to see my dad drowning! That makes my throat dry! I would tremble! Are you not ashamed to say you are Esthappan master's son! It will be better for you to discard this and seek some other job I wanted to become a Father in church! - You only prevented me - Because I loved you... But if you continue to behave like a child... ...one day I would leave you! They are celebrating their victory! You don't waste time standing here! Clean your clarinet and put it on the attic This is appam Give it to your mom! How great was this band? Now every year we are losing It has become a routine! Gulp it! Can you get me pork meat? I would whack your throat You have already devoured 2 Kgs of pork meat Slug! Has lost the competition! Jesus! He is crestfallen! He is not playing the clarinet! He is weeping through the instrument! Take the boat to the toddy shop! Today we must batter them! My Lord! Thommeri Davis and his group are coming here! Don't know what is going to happen today! Guys! They are coming here! "Granny's children! You are a pain in the neck!" "Will you not go?" "Don't play an endless game This is a queer lancet!" "We don't want to win or lose! We are incompetent!" "Times have changed! Appearances also have changed!" "it is all seamed! It is a raucous rooster call!" "Losers became obdurate!" "Why did your nose tip turn red?" "Why is your gaze embarrassed?" "Why your words are incisive?" "Why is your gaze embarrassed?" "Why your words are incisive?" "Am I your kith and kin to clap?" "Are you a rogue because you consume Therutha's toddy!" "Who am I to you! Am I a brother or a bother to you!" "Don't you want to be well disposed with your neighbour!" "Did you not run away without turning your back?" "But now are you not panting?" "After drinking toddy you can't even stand erect!" "Come straight to me!" "Lying down and staying at home You were shamed!" "To win or lose, you could not bid on us!" "Times have changed! Appearances also have changed!" "it is all seamed! It is a raucous rooster call!" "Was it not Mariamma on the dais?" "While she strip teased her hubby would sit in front yard!" "Look at the sun alas! It appears like moon!" "it is a rhythmic beat!" "Scamp, come on perform! How dare you abuse my dad!" "You can't even uphold your esteem and repute!" "You scoffed others! Have you got anything to say now!" "When you strike back and forth to wash dhoti..." "...the dhoti went past Bums did not notice this!" "While stupes and dullards were watching two bums..." "...they were busy making a mallet for a game!" "They were busy making a mallet for a game!" - Come here guys! - Stop it! Dogs! Defeat us in slugfest, if you can! Anybody can combat anyone If you mean slugfest, come to our place! We too have men at our place! If we want to bash you... ...we would come to your house Do you want to see that? Then bash me! You should have shown this spirit while playing the band! Move away! Your dad Kochu Lonappan taught me to play clarinet! Do you know what he told me... ...when he gave me the clarinet for the first time? God blew soil and made man... ...and gave music to give life to man Every time we breath we are giving life to this clarinet There is neither defeat nor victory for a genuine musician Only music dwells! Do you mean to belittle our musicians! If you have any self esteem, compete and defeat them Then deliver your discourse! Even if the Gee Varghese Band toils for 50 years... ...this trophy in the name of the Lord ...would stay before the garlanded photo of my dad Kochu Lonappan This is a challenge thrown by Thommeri Davis! Come Mariamma! Don't blabber because you won this time! Come or! guys! We will show our mettle in the next year's competition! Year long toils for teaching a band like this... ...and later dumping in the attic is futile It would be better to fart in the backwaters rather than doing this At least two bubbles would surface and blast with a sound Trumpet, Clarinet and yosr attires keep everything on the attic! Unless I tell you no one should touch it! Go to the other side of the bank If you come this side again... ...we would drop you guys in the backwaters! - That is not required! - Not like that! Father! When our band was victorious... Louis Pope and Esthappan master were in the forefront! When the boat capsized with Mathoon and 4 other people... ...my son in law and Molamma were also dead Along with them our band was also drowned! That can't be viewed as insignificant! Stop it! We are hearing this story for years! When there is a difference of opinion on the church band... ...let us put to vote to decide if we should continue the band or not? Before that let this guy give a reply, Father! Let him respond! He is silent when the church committee is questioning Under the circumstances please don't think I am also raising an issue We need an answer! There was a time when the Gee Varghese band was a big-name Those days band earned money for the church! Those days even if a key is defective in clarinet... ...a new clarinet would be given If someone can not play it right he would be replaced by a new person Those golden days of the church band... ...are now enjoyed by the Martha Mariam band on the other side of the banks Have anyone of you bothered to ask... ...how church band members make a livelihood? Our band members fair Thoma and kochu Agusti... ...sold their houses and crossed the waters to join their band They did so out of poverty For the last few years the Gee Varghese band... ...is defeated by the church and no one else I don't have any further elaboration on this! Those present here want to dissolve the band Please inform this in the Sunday Prayer mass, Father! If the members of the parish also have the same opinion... I have nothing more to say Come or! guys! Go! What is this pope! You have not completed it this time also Half way through, is it not? After the Edathuva Church festival we were all returning in a boat All those who accompanied were sleeping! It was a bright full moon day! Suddenly Esthappan took his clarinet... ...and started playing a tune unheard until then! In an excitement, I also joined him! All those who were sleeping got up! In that bright moonlit night... ...amidst few of us, I felt it was Saint sitting there right in the middle In our experience none of us have ever played such a tune... After birth and death you swim across to another point It was such a bliss! Esthappan used to tell me always... ...at a convenient time we should reach the ultimate But it did not happen It could not be completed by both of us! Couldn't complete it In life everything breaks halfway through! Esthappan and Molamma are no more with us ltteri, Kochu Thomma, Antappan All of them have gone! Now our band will also go! I have witnessed it After winning the trophies from Edathuva, Chambakulam and Cherukara... ...you and Esthappan would reach the shores of our place in boat Who recalls all those days? Relax yourself pope! To set right all these... Saint will send someone This is my surmise! This boat does not follow the safety regulations stipulated by the government For all those travelling in this boat... ...there is only one life jacket and that is worn by me If passengers sit quiet this boat will reach shore! Quite for some time I wanted to sit with you people Dead people are better than those living! Cheers! What is this? Come on have a drink! 'ITTOOP LOTTERY PAWN BROKERS' ittoop brother! Boat has come lam making a move I said I am making a move! Brother! Mom fainted! Get her tablets! Get money from lttoop's shop lam going for collections! You may go I will get her tablets! Seems you would wait for the boat to return from the banks You go home! Mom is alone Don't order me Clara, I will go! Are you trying to stare me down? If you misbehave with me, with the umbrella I would throw you in the lake! Let me see that! Clara! You may go The boat has arrived! - Yabber! - Go prattler! Have this cashew! Is he Saint Gee Varghese! He has a lance with him What he needs is a horse! Give me a lime soda! Brother! The church... Are you not the son of Puthukudi Thomas sir! From America and then Bombay How did you guess? You are a replica of Thoma sir! Can't I recogonize? Where are your things? It would come in the boat later Now I have come! Come on Ride as my pillion! I want to go to the church! Will people coming to Kumarangiri go home without seeing the Saint? Get on to the bike lam also going to the church! This bike belongs to the church! I am the sacristan, Ouseph! Are you the sacristan! Then let us go! Brother! Sacristan! Give this to the senior Father! Tell him Chachappan gave this! - What is the matter! - I want to stop drinking! Inform Father to pray for me at a convenient time! There is no urgency! He can take his own time! I will give him! 'But this fish will not reach church' 'It will reach the kitchen at sacristan's house!' 'From there it will travel to sacristan's intestine!' 'Amen!' Hold this son! Is he using the oil meant for rockets in his bike? Now you must buy some lands in Kumarangiri Marry a beautiful girl and settle here I would arrange for everything! What do you say? There are lot of beautiful girls in Kumarangiri Shall I bring marriage proposals? Is priests in our parish allowed to marry? Why do you ask this? I am the new junior vicar for this church! Father Vincent Vattoli! Fish! Father! Praise the Lord! All the time Praise the Lord! I am the new junior vicar - Vincent Vattoli lam telling the truth! I have come to take charge! I am Father lrunnalamkuzhi Joseph lrunnalamkuzhi! Attuva parish vicar is my cousin Father idannalamkulam! But there was no information about your arrival! I had to come suddenly! Where did you stitch this robe? This is not stitched It is ready made apparel! Pants and shirt! - What? - Pants and shirt Seems you didn't have time to wear the priest's robe! No Father! Priest robe can be worn while doing religious duties! I am used to wearing these! I am comfortable in these attire at normal times! - What? - Comfortable! Besides, does our parish stipulate wearing robes all the time? You must be weary after the travel Have some fruits! - Come on! - No thanks! Then it is ok A priest is a replica of Jesus This is what I have learnt! A replica of Jesus wearing pants and shirts is little excessive Is it not Vattoli? When I am a vicar of this parish I don't want any outside influences! Glasses and shoes Glasses and shoes! Even otherwise there are few revolutionaries in this parish! This parish can not bear the brunt of having another revolutionary Father! So if you want to continue as a junior vicar of this church Change these attire and wear the priest's robe! Yes Father! Is it permissible to have two extra pockets in the robe? I guess it is not permitted Okay Tomorrow morning will be Vattoli's first mass! Let me see how smart he is! My god! No problem! You can wear it! Seems the church band lost this year also! - Yes, we lost Father! - What happened? That is a big story! Seems neighbouring parish got the trophy this time also! Right? It was all planned! They have lots of money! Thommeri Davis and his wife Mariamma Both of them have lots of money - Does Davis play? - Never! His dad Kochu Lonappan used to play! These people will make others play their band... ...win the trophy and steal the limelight Both of them That lady is flashy! She would wear a shirt, dhoti and a dark glass! Is it? Solomon, attend the call Father! I am scared to attend calls! There are just 2 phones in this town! One in contractor's house and another one in church! Your brother has assumed charge in a church! Can't you visit me? His aunt in Kayankulam slipped in bathroom! We had been there and just returned! Give it to me! Give The jack fruit stain will go on the phone! Dear Brother in law! Big brother in law! Dear brother in law! Big brother in law! What is the news! Did you not go home? I had to come here earlier for some wok Any way, if you call from the other banks... ...me and your sister would reach there! Did you meet Ottapla Father? Yes I met him, taunted and then only came here! Your younger brother is taunting Ottapla Father! Have you started your pranks! If I come to know any of your mischieves there... I would immediately come there in a boat! Ok Is it your sister, Father? We have only one sister, Mariamma! - You know her - Is it? She is married to Thommeri Davis of the other bank! I take leave Father! It is time to ring the bell! Solomon, wait! You complained about my sister and brother in law How can you leave just like that! I don't know anything Vincent Vattoli from Changanaserry... Why should he choose Kumarangiri parish to become a junior vicar? Do you know Solomon? I don't know Father! Will the church band survive tomorrow's voting? What do you think Solomon? I don't know about that too, Father! But I have understood one thing! It is a concerted planned move! Gee Varghese band does not belong to the church alone! It belongs to this town and also to the Lord in this church! I don't want anything to happen to the band! Before we decide to continue or not the Saint Gee Varghese band... ...our church's new priest Father Vincent Vattoli ...would address you briefly! I saw this place for the first time on a new year day long ago! I was a young child then! I was like the little son sitting in front! - What is your name son'? - Joy men! I was like Joy mon! That day my dad said something to his brother! That is still ringing in my ears! In Kumarangiri, one can't find a person... ...who has not hummed a song or who has not fallen in love at least once When I stepped in to this place... ...my dad and uncle took me first to this church! Through the big gathering... ...what struck me first was a priceless thing! People who came out of the church touched and caressed that! It is still vivid in my memory! After many years I have returned to this place as a priest! When I entered the Saint's church again... ...my eyes were looking for that invaluable thing! It is there It is still here! When I returned on that day in boat with dad and uncle... ...along with ice stick and toys I took along one more thing The music of this town! The music of this place made Kumarangiri renowned! That music was shared to everyone who lived here... ...by the saint Gee Varghese band! That band is now like this neglected piano... ...full of dust and is getting ready to receive its last rites! Esthappan master, ltteri, Kochu Thommy, Antappan What was drowned in the lake was merely their bodies! You have forgotten all of them After having lost all near and dear... ...Pope Louis is, still living for the sake of music! If you don't want him... ...you would be losing the soul of Kumarangiri ...and also Kumarangiri's music Let that music bring back excitement and integration of this town Should we not submit the ever rolling trophy... ...at the feet of the saint again? What do you say Lonappan brother? Don't you want ittoop brother? - What about you Joy mon? - I want Should we dissolve the church band? No No No Father! You could have contested the election! I have contested and won too! "The entire village looked in overwhelming surprise!" "From where did this divine messenger come?" "You caress while weaving a tender leaf garland!" "You have changed the feeble wind! Is it a fortune for this town?" "Your flair is throbbing and shining outwardly!" "Welcome you Welcome you!" "You are a pulsating fortitude!" "Vattoli father's gait is graceful and rhythmic" "it's a rhythmic sway to left and right!" "Have you not noticed his captivating smile!" "How elegant he is! It is a treat to watch!" "We are endowed with this gift today!" "Vattoli!" "His words are coated with honey! His looks are serene!" "You are a fortune to this town!" "Vattoli" "The gentle breeze from south is nippy!" "To get over the chill you fell in campfire and wine!" "The gentle breeze from south is nippy!" "To get over the chill you fell in campfire and wine!" "Sunshine of Kumaram!" "Good people vowed for betterment..." "...you sprouted like a golden ray from a mango seed!" "You are like Kuravilangadu saviour! Country's first sailor captain!" "it is cherubic! The song and rhythm!" "Like an harvest let us celebrate!" "Vattoli!" "Vattoli!" "Vattoli!" "Vattoli!" He is wearing pants and sun glasses! Is he a Father? Saint has sent us Vattoli Father! - Sufficient for one load - My god! Say so You are an artist! Yesterday I thought why should a Father coming from eastern hill side... ...argue for Gee Varghese band? That is why I said only those who drink toddy... ...will know the taste of the carp fish! Is it not? Come in! Have you seen her Father? She is from France Michelle All those who came with her have returned! She wants to learn our music and stayed back! Her parents are not in agreement with her She is a smart girl! Child! This is Father Vincent! He is our church's new junior vicar! Pappan! Shouldn't Solomon practice playing! Let him first learn to hold it properly Father! Is it not Charlie? When one plays it should not be merely blowing out air! Music should also come! You are a Father in the Church! Yes But the other day you danced with me in the boat! I understand English! But I like to talk in Malayalam! I can understand Malayalam! What is wrong in both of us dancing together? People and your culture... ...would miscon- Will not misconstrue People with good intentions never misconstrue! They will look at us as two human beings! It is like a cinema scene! You dog! Go Stop there! You need not bathe at home sacristan! I did not insist on selling the house... ...because I don't want you and kids to be left in lurch! I have made some computations I will take a decision shortly about that! Then you decide quickly and inform us Should we also not know about it? - You... - Don't do it dad! Hope you know... If I consider the interest and compound interest Esthappan owe... ...even if the house is sold you may have to pay me Went there to help them! Come fast! I left the dinner half way 'The food leftover by sacristan...' '...would have been by now consumed by his pet dog Chakki!' 'The deal for Chakki will follow' Stay there! 'That night 7 1/2 year old chakki died due to sacristan's fatal blows!' ls there anything tastier than this? Couldn't you get some fish? Is anything stuffed in your throat? No point in opening your mouth when you come for food! Do you know what is happening here? How will you know? All the time you roam around carrying the clarinet! My dad's name is Esthappan! I will roam with the clarinet! I care a damn if others feel bad about it! For one week I have been telling you to change the bulb! Today mom went there and fell down Until now she was screaming! She has just gone to bed! When can I see you thriving? I will die only after seeing you well off I don't know mom! Don't cry dear Clara! - Is Solomon not there? - He is inside! What is it? He has been asked to go to the church! Junior Vicar has a session! Is it? Yes, bro I have just come from church! You may leave! I will go Give me some water, Clara! No I asked because of thirst! Does this hen lay eggs? No, it lays orange Shall I get some? Give that vessel I have other works to do Wait for a moment! I saw you keeping the paper there! Seems you took great troubles! If you drink water like this you will find time only to urinate! Have you not gone yet? Get into the boat! I am coming! Has Nancy come for delivery? Yes Go hen! In whose house is the session? Looks like at the contractors house! My God! - Sebi! - Brother! Father! Should I accompany? If I come, they may not like it! You keep quiet! We don't go for sitting on such criteria Philipose! What is it in the sac? It is hen's dung, manure for plantains Take care not to soil your foot! It has a good smell! What is this Father? Will it be possible to hang on the comb of a rooster? Because your family is big your parents would have... ...vowed to make one of them a Father, is it so? Father Ottaplakal only does sacraments at our house! The Senior Vicar considers them as insignificant! Let it happen The saint will forgive! Where are you going? I am going for a blessing! Will you not come for the band practice in the evening? Seems you are close with the lady! Poor girl! She is very religious! Will blessing the house make it alright? Do one thing! I will give you the holy book and holy water! You may do it and return them at your convenience to the church! You sit quiet, but give knockout punches! Keep quiet you dog! I would jab at your vital spots! Don't take it seriously It is somniloquy He is not drunk! Lord! Let this holy water provide protection... ...from evil spirits and all that is unholy Amen! Blessing is over Someone from the house read the bible! Child! Psalms of Solomon! The sacred poems from 1 to 10 Let HIM kiss me with his lips Your Love for me is absorbing Your oil is fragrant! Your name is like an oil stream So virgins love you! Draw me to follow you! We would run together! You dog! Are you showing roguery in my house? - Mathacha! - My God! Leave him Mathacha! Don't hit him! Move away! Run away from here! Run! Father! Move away! - I would kill you beggar! - Stay quiet! How dare he enters our house and make our girl... Father! Take him away! Go! - You dog! - Calm down! We will drown our girl and burn you fellow! Get to the other banks Go man! - Solomon! - Never mind Father! Do you know father... Actually I wanted to join the seminary! Then... It was Shoshanna who... When your people said... ...have you started with your belongings to join the seminary? What are you talking Shoshanna? He got a divine call! Then what else will he do other than joining the seminary? You move away! Give me the number of the God who called him! Let me ask, if he called him? When did I call? I have not called anyone! What are you talking? Is the God carrying a phone? You move away! The boat will go now! Have you forgotten the blooming at school? What is that man? - Blooming! - What does that mean? Blooming is a word! What did I give to guys like Francis, Anto and Raghu who gave me letters? - What did she give? - Blows! What did I give you? What did she give you? - Kiss! - Kiss? Have you not heard about kiss? At the cemetery bushes what did you do to me? At the cemetery bushes what did you do man? Don't you know what is done at the cover of bushes? Shoshanna! I am like your dad... ...I tell you even if the leaf falls on the thorn or thorn falls on leaf Move away! It is confirmed the sacristan has fallen down! - My God! - Stay there man! I want to know your decision right now! Do you want to join seminary and become a Father in church... ...or do you want to marry me and father my children? I would father your children! What? I would like to be father of your children! Heard you called me Father! Heard it is urgent, so I rushed here! More than 1500 people have signed and sent a petition... ...to the Bishop's house! The demand is to remove Father Ottaplakan who is... ...the vicar of Kumarangiri parish for the last 15 years! Today Bishop called Father and told him to change... ...parish after the church's festival! We know not even a stone moves in Kumarangiri without your knowledge Who spearheaded the petition drive got signatures of so many people... ...and sent it to the Bishops's palace? This assignment should reach the destination safely! My saint! Sacristan! That is... Any problem in revealing the name? Though it is true how can I betray persons in the group? I am also a witness to the preparation of petition... ...and making people signatories! It was done by... Is it not the Gee Varghese band group maintained by the church for decades? Right? I swear on Lord and saint... ...I am not involved in this! I told Louise Pappan and Chali Pappan... ...umpteen times not to do this! They did not pay heed When I eased myself what a great relief! Dog faeces! What is it Pappa! Have you started early today? What is it in the boat? Is it shrimps? Good riposte for Pappan's music! Who is it? Might be someone from Davi's band on the other banks Then take this one! That is Esthappan's style! Who is there to play this? - Who is it? - I can't see! There is no light in the boat! Go close to that boat! Give that light to me! Who is this vying to compete with Pappan? My God! Solomon! Was it you? From whom did you learn this my son? - Come near me! - Go there! Go there! Let me see your face once! My Esthappan is not dead! My Esthappan's music is also not dead! Play my Son! Play! 'When Louis Pappan learned Esthappan's son...' '...Solomon is a wizard, it was exactly 7 hours and 2 minutes' 'The same evening, the mother duck did not know...' '...if the egg was dropped in lake or boat' '...looked perplexed and was staring at the sky!' 'Without losing a moment, an arched coconut tree over the backwaters...' '...dropped a red coconut in water!' 'The same evening Shoshanna's marriage with Davis's nephew Alby...' '...settled in US was verbally finalised by Philipose contractor' 'Esthappan master and Angels were sulking after a game' 'Ink spread on the speech I was preparing for the next day mass' 'At that time Ottplakkan Father was worried about his parish change ' 'Sacristan Kochu Ouseph was closing the church doors with a bang!' How old is this church sacristan? Must be 300-400 years old! Then balks and rafters would have attenuated The roof and terrace would have eroded! Then any time the church's roof... ...may fall on those assembled for prayers in church! Yes Father! Should we not protect the Kumarangiri devottees! A Father thus protecting the Kumarangiri people... ...should never be disturbed from this parish! We would send a petition to this effect to the Bishop's palace! We would certainly send one! The responsibility of building the new church... ...would be given to the devotee Philipose contractor - Is it not Father? - Yes So the sacristan will oversee the renovation... ...and the vicar of the church would close his eyes to some of the deeds of sacristan 'AMEN' I saw...l saw! Wearing red silk and an armour sitting on a snow white colour horse I saw our saint! 'Kumarangiri church's terrace, balks rafters and pillars are weakened!' 'Ottaplaka! Before its roof fall on the head of my beloved people...' '...Kumarangiri church must be rebuilt' Our Saint said this to me He said "Is it not a fete ordained from above?" "Did not the saint say it univocally?" "if postponed, it will ravage generations!" "Who said it is a command from above?" "Don't sow lies that would not sprout!" "it's easy to demolish! But difficult to build and raise!" "Don't we need a wall to draw the cross?" "Don't we need a church to assemble?" "To save our esteem under the sky, don't we need a roof?" "To hold the roof, don't we need a firm wall?" "Don't we need a roof and wall for the church?" "Doesn't the church need staff and musicians?" "Doesn't the church need a bell and a sacristan?" "What...what?" "Like the old one don't we need a new birth?" "Should not the church also have a transformation?" "Doesn't the church need an edifice and a tower?" "Doesn't the church need a wall and a chamber?" "To raise a new one need to demolish the present one" "We can demolish and build a new one" "Whether the church is there or not..." "...don't wreck our boozing!" "if we don't get booze..." "We would stir up! Would stir up!" "if the church is there or not..." "...is there or not ls there..." "Can't demolish the church" "We can't" "Demolishers hands would burn!" "Hands would burn!" "We would demolish!" "You don't demolish!" "We would demolish! You don't demolish" "We would demolish! You don't demolish!" "We would demolish! You don't demolish!" "We would demolish! You don't demolish!" "We would demolish! You don't demolish!" "We would demolish! You don't demolish!" "We would demolish! You don't demolish!" She is far away Solomon! Philipose contractor is smart! Without anyone knowing in this side of the lake... ...he took her to a church across the lake for engagement! Seeing the American groom she has fallen flat! You take two pieces of this! Bite the sorrow and push down the throat Solomon! Paila! ls there pork meat in kitchen? - Is it there mom? - Must be there in the vessel! It is a never ending sorrow mom! Don't you know Solomon that women are treacherous! On the night of a festival in church... ...do you know with whom my hubby eloped to Tamilnadu? ...It was my own sister That whore...! My god! What is it? Chain got entangled! - What! - Chain got entangled! Solomon his chain got entangled! - All of you hear this! - Where did it get entangled! - Mom! Don't put me to shame! - You are a shameless guy! - Go fellow! - Is he not your son! He is wearing a long chain like a father and... My Jesus! You have given me a son who is a... l am going... Solomon! Wear your dhoti and go! Poor fellow! He has started drinking toddy! God has given you a talent! Instead of refining and polishing that talent... ...you were after a girl See what has happened? When she saw another guy... ...did she not prove she is her father's daughter! During mornings, have you ever visited the band? In 4 month's time we have the competition! If you are not serious you will not play this time! You are not a person to become obscure because of a girl! Go, have a sound sleep and come for tomorrow's practice! Father! It was like a idiotic act, Father! They were determined not to inform me beforehand! I learnt the girl is Shoshanna only after going there! If I tell you something, will you do it for me Father? What is it Solomon? Enough Father! We can go That window will not open hereafter! I will stop playing clarinet from today! I think you can decide on that after getting down from my shoulder! Father to the left! To the right Father! To the left! Father! Your name is like an oil stream So virgins love you! Draw me to follow you! We would run together! I want to see you both together before I die Granny! Her marriage is fixed Why should she come here? That too with him! Mathacha! She is my daughter! She will honour her words! We have fixed her marriage! Besides! She is right in front of us! Yes If I say... What happened? - Has the power gone? - Is it power shutdown! Power is resumed! My God! Jesus and Mary are missing! It is a festival and it is in procession But we can't avoid saying this - Who's face it is? - Ours! Boat is coming! You may go I will take care of the rest! Brother in law! What is this? You are having a lance and crown! Who is this? Is it Jesus? - Is it not Shoshanna? - Davis! Don't let him go Don't let him go! Catch him! - Matha! Don't beat him - Don't beat Leave me... Father, please tell them to stop beating me Father, please tell them to stop beating me I don't have any share in this blood! Let someone call Father Let Father take a decision on this! He has abducted a girl whose engagement is over! He is not doing a sacristan's job! You beggar! See the venomous guy's stance! If we don't get a decision on this We would kill him today! - Leave him - He would die - Leave him! - Move away! Shoshanna from a respectable family is engaged to another respectable family Are you trying to tarnish our family esteem? You sacristan! If anyone touches him... ...he would not leave Kumarangiri with that hand - Move away - You...! ' Stop it! - You...! Our girl was abducted The loss is ours! But you are trying to overawe us? Who abducted your daughter? They have eloped! The entire town knows they are lovers! But did you not fix her marriage with another guy? If the children love each other You must help them to get married! Damn it! Come here girl! She is my only child Have you understood? Then for what fu****g thing are you here? - You are... - Stop I say The entire town knows the status of a sacristan of this church! Every one here is involved in love The sacristan is in love here! - Stop it man - Leave it man He is not a mere sacristan! He is a good artist too! He is my Esthappan's son! Artist! Does he have any value in Kumarangiri? Does he have a penny with him? His intentions were different! If he married my daughter, he can eat for life time without a job Even otherwise for quite some time Kumarangiri people have started devouring Sitting on terrace and whistling passersby at junction... ...are the only thing they know ls there a single person here who knows to play clarinet? Damn with Louis Pappan and his group! They play in some toddy shop unnoticed by anyone! Does anyone in Kumarangiri including Esthappan's son... ...has the guts to come forward and play? If they climb the dais they would urinate! Take it from me! If the Gee Varghese band is playing for the coming new year Solomon would be at the forefront! For the last 17 years you have never come near the dais Will you play in the band? I will... Then will you win the trophy? Tell him brother! We will win the trophy! We will win! If the clarinet I play has life... If the saint in this church is true... We will occupy the dais and play! We will win the trophy! And we will dedicate it to the saint too! In case you win the trophy we will offer last 8 years prize money... ...won by Martha Mariam band to this boy! Is it not contractor? Yes! Shoshanna was engaged to our boy! If you win the trophy, we offer to marry Shoshanna to Solomon Tell contractor, you would abide it! I would! - If it is otherwise... - Tell me Tell Pappan! Gee Varghese band will never play again! We will decide Shoshanna is not destined to marry Solomon! That is enough! Stop it! Whatever is said here does not bind the church or the vicar of this church But we did not ask you take this responsibility Not only that, for a band of this type... ...church will not spend a penny! The church no longer is associated with this band! The church can only ban the band You cannot forbid us from competing! We will get a person to sponsor the band from this side of the bank itself! Let us see that Bye Pappan! Will see you at the competition! We will Do you know who helped the junior sacristan in abduction? It was the junior vicar! Mathacha take leave and come! - Come! - Solomon...! Come, let's go Instead you could have killed me! Father! Where should I keep this? I mean this lance and crown! Father Vincent Vattoli! Pack your belongings Don't forget to take your pants, shirt and sun glasses! Hereafter you may not have to wear a robe! You need not waste time until tomorrow morning to vacate! I have not done anything so far that my conscience did not permit lam damn sure it will not happen henceforth too! Wait Father! Senior Vicar feels you are against the demolition of the church! This ire is because of that! What do you want me to do sacristan? You should not impede his actions Demolishing the church stopping the church band... ...or preventing lovers coming together Which one I should not impede? I said this because of my love for you, Father! But if you help a devotee coming to church... ...and a helper of the church to elope Will the locals tolerate you Father? Sacristan! I have not made any vow... ...to continue in Kumarangiri parish amidst so many hardships I would pack my things and will be ready! When you get information from the Bishop's palace, call me! Ok Father! Pappan! What made you wager my affair with Shoshanna... ...for a band competition? If Pappan did not do that together both sides would have killed you Solomon don't you believe our band can stage a show? How is it possible, Pappan? All these years, all of you tried and could not succeed! How will I do it? Even after engagement with another guy Shoshanna came with me! How will I pacify her? All of you have ruined my life! Pappan! On what basis you thought we can... ...win the trophy with Solomon at forefront! Thoma! Keep quiet! Seems Pappan forgot our efforts for this band for many years! Has he proved his caliber for you to support him? Who are you to say we would stop playing band if we lose this time! For the sake of a good for nothing fellow... ...should we stop playing band It was a bit excessive Pappan! Don't you want others to hear the music you held back all these years! Don't you need your girl? My Esthappan's son! Tell me They would not win, son! Tell me Will not we win? If your decision is final, then we don't like to play in this band! If that is band master's decision, Solomon would play from forefront And we would win the trophy! I tell you! If anyone is opposed to Solomon as the lead player... Tell that right now! Chali Pappan! Why are you so worked up? For quiet some time I have been planning this for you! Don't think no one knows about your behind the scene maneuvers! I don't want to see you around the band anymore! Go man! Go dog! Who is coming here at this midnight? From now on Gee Varghese band is not run by the church! I, Chachappan is going to sponsor the band henceforth! Even if it means spending a lot, I don't mind! I am not doing this for fun! Gee Varghese Saint told me to do it! 'That night Ottaplakal Father and Ouseph sacristan...' '...also had a dream that could not be deciphered ' Father Vincent is a son of my cousin! This is his first parish Let him continue here! - Yes! - Let it be so! Then you think about it and do what is required! Yes! 'Next day morning Vishakol Pappan crossed the waters and joined...' '...Thommeri davis's Martha Mariam Band' "You fluttered!" "Weary eyes! Go to sleep!" "Weary eyes! Go to sleep!" "My heart is stirred up" "it's full of desires!" "Will you not give yours!" "You held my fingers even without me knowing it!" "Soulfully...!

"Rainbow of my psyche..." "...would resound the cherubic amen!" Ponnappa! Don't take the boat close! Go straight! I have something to talk to Father! Is this your regular work Father? I mean, abduction! Don't stare Father! They are my friends! He is Mr.Ernakulam He is...runner up! Father! For one day can I take her with me? Amen! Dear Kumarangiri residents! For the 50th Gee Varghese ever rolling Trophy... ...there will be a three day Band competition at Church Premises We welcome you all The next day after the competition our church's demolition work will commence Hence from the same day prayers and worships... ...would be held in the temporary thatched shed at contractor Philippose's premises Son! Did you call me? Here is a son who farts and a mom who responds to farts! Son! Don't suspect the anus that farted! If you wipe it with sand you can eat it with rice flakes! In the boat that reached the jetty that day There were 3groups who are going to rewrite the history of Kumarangiri maintenance One was an archaeologist to take a final decision on demolition of church Second was two thugs imported by Contractor Philippose to handle Solomon Vikraman Muthtu Come Walk It is not yet over! Third one - to drub Gee Varghese Band... Thommeri Davis paid to bring from Fort Kochi Chavelier Pothachan! So this is Kumarangiri! Sir! Jetty is on this side! He has gone! Hold my hand! This side - Where? - Here! Anyway I am drenched! I will be there at the shop! You just come there! - Saint has come earlier - Who is this guy? Is this the horse or is it snake? On inspection, we are convinced that... ...there is substantial weakening to the church building! Kumarangiri church has to be demolished and rebuilt! We don't see any other way out! Come or! guys! How about it sir! Is it sufficient to maul him or should we break his limbs? Therutha! Get me two bottles of toddy! He is Pothachan Chavelier Pothachan! Davis has brought him from fort Kochi!

For the present they are biting the leg piece! Poor fellows! Shall I serve you some chicken curry? You never told me your daughter is a hothead! Who are the bootlicks of Gee Varghese band? Were you asking for me? If so, I am right in front of you, Pothacha Pappa! Seems you have lost your old drive! If someone plays, don't you have the strength fight back "Desires were benumbed!" "Hands wearing rings hardened" "But mind alone... mind alone..." First time, at the Kanjoor church for Saint Sebastian's festival Is it not? Later at Saint Sebastian's festival at Chalakudy church! At Ollur Gabriela angel's festival Lastly at Kottamam Sain't Rocke's festival That day you floored me! I was shamed and heard insults! I think that was the last time, right? No, I was waiting for your return! Esthappan left without giving us a chance Now you are the only one left I have some scores to settle! I have not come to Kumarangiri for money! Not for wine or women! I want to defeat you at least once! I am obdurate about it For this time you may discard that desire! Come next time I will lose it for your sake! No Pappan!

I have come with a solution for everything! Davis band's fair Thoma's brother Paulachan... ...would marry Clara without demanding a penny! I mean the Paulachan who is working in the Cashew factory! After the festival Solomon can play in the Davis band at a good salary This is the house document I took from Esthappan Besides all this, I take the responsibility... ...to see he marries Shoshanna at the Kumarangiri Church!

SQ"! Solomon! Please wait! Let me tell you! Solomon! I know you play better than your dad Esthappan If you play the band would win too After the competition you may play Play anywhere you like! What will they pay you for this service? Do you know what will happen to a family if the church excludes them? You will not get rice Not even a crystal of salt Will not get water! Not even a child in the parish would talk to the family Mom and children may have to leave the place in midnight! The saint is inside the cage! But all functions are carried out by the father and the sacristan! "Our band is named after the saint!" "Whoever confronts us will lose!" "Victory is not yours!" "The honour is ours!"

Two teams are selected for the last round! I am reading out the names! Kumarangiri Gee Varghese Band! Thommeri Martha Mariam Band! No one in Kumarangiri would have thought you would play clarinet so well! I was also diffident! - Is this a new one? - No, it is an old one Father! So, tomorrow will you play with this? So the church band will win, right? For your sake you want me to lose! Now play tomorrow and try to win! My God! What is it? Son! What happened? Jesus! Tell me son! How will I play tomorrow! My clarinet... To play, I... Is this not dad's? I don't want to learn what happened! Tomorrow you are playing with this! It is our dad's desire that you should play with this at stage tomorrow! I didn't know my brother is a whizz than our dad! I didn't know about it! Shoshanna! Don't ask me where is the clarinet you gave me? That is no more with me This is my dad's Esthappan master's! Wherever he has taken this or used he has seen only victories! But I am not Esthappan master! Have I ever won? If I take the stage tomorrow, our band will lose! I am going! I can't... Will you go? Will you lose? If you lose, along with you Louis Pappan who has faith in you will also lose Kumarangiri will also lose! Don't you want to win? Don't you want to marry me? Whose screams you were responding at this midnight? I will go! If my Solomon calls I will go even if it is midnight! Tomorrow will be your guys last day playing of the instrument! Let me see how you will reach the church premises! Until we return from the church tomorrow... ...don't open the door! Aunt! Ask him to open the door! Brother! Open it! Vattoli! Are you going to hit me? I don't want others to know about certain things! Tell me, what it is! What you did yesterday were deeds not supposed... ...to be done by a person wearing the robe! What is it? You broke Solomon's clarinet... ...you don't even qualify to be a human being, Father! I am wearing this robe for the last 40 years! You need not teach me the do's and don'ts of wearing this robe! Diocese has not given you robe and authority to help a girl whose engagement... ...is over to elope with someone! One does not become a father to work against... ...the church, diocese, superiors and noble Christians Bible says a tree that does not produce fruit... ...will be cut down and thrown into the fire But what I learned evidently from bible is 'let us love one another' Father, you have time only to roam around with a foreign woman! Locals say you would soon discard the robes! Those days locals said the same thing about Jesus and Mary Magdalene It was Lord Jesus Christ who was crucified Not Father Vincent Vattoli! So let us not try to taunt each other on this score! You believe, if you close your eyes, it is night! Don't think no one knows the motive behind the church demolition! For certain deeds I follow my own style! I will do what is required to make others also think in those lines! You are not the congregation! But I am the vicar of the Kumarangiri church! Whether it is demolition of church or dissolving the band... ...or Shoshanna's marriage with Solomon it is I who take the final decision! On top of that is the saint who protects the church and Lord Jesus! They will also have made some decisions! Father! Have a cup of coffee! The competition is about to start! No thanks, Father! Will have coffee after the competition! L...l will stay here! Me and the saint want to hear you play and win! Chali! Dear friends! The exciting contest is about to start! The two teams are ready like war horses! I read your letter kept inside the rafter! Try to play well and win! I will give you a reply then! Clap your hands and encourage them! Yes clap like that! Competition is going to start! Dear friends! We welcome you all to witness this competition! Dear friends! The exciting contest is about to start! We invite both teams to the stage! Both teams have occupied the dais! Both teams are charged up electrifying competition! Few minutes from now the competition starts! Come on clap! Come on Play soft where required and loud where required! The clarinet now in your hand will decide whether you should live or not! A sobbing person with prayers is sitting inside! Don't forget that! Did you not hear how he played the third tempo yesterday! Is he the guy who is going to defeat me and win the trophy? Today he would poop while playing! "It is a prayer to Saint Gee Varghese" "Challenge or defiance!" "Even if we die we would not give up!" "Challenge or defiance!" "Even if we die we would not give up!" "Defeat stares you! But putting up a brave face!" "Defeat stares you! But putting up a brave face!" "Challenge or defiance!" "Death or defeat...!" I don't know about the decision of the judges! But I know about one thing! I can't play better than this! 'Perhaps he did not want to witness the church demolition!' 'So he left us earlier!' - Philipose! - What is it, Father? Solomon! You proceed! Should we not take a decision on this? About what? You made a promise! If Solomon wins the competition... You mean that one...! Me making a promise on street and he winning the trophy is all true But how can I give my daughter to him? Is this a child's play, Father? I can consider about it... ...if the guy who played the bet with me who is in grave or the saint tells me As I decided earlier, my daughter would marry Davis's nephew Is it not Davis? If that is to happen my dad should not be Thommeri Kochu Pappan if you are manly honor your words! For idiotic acts like this don't expect my support! After the first mass and first consecration of the new church... ...the first wedding at the new church will be my daughter's We will invite all and sundry! Come and enjoy the free feast! Go guys! Come Matha! Move away! First remove the saint! Then do the rest! 'Kumarangiri rained for one full day and night!' 'Along with that 3 great things happened!'
