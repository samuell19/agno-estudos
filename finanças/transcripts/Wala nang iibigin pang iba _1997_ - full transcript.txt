I thought that we two and the officials are the ones who should know about it? you know, that's what's baffling us Sarah my God... but, we let it be handled by the NBI (National Bureau of Investigation) they promised to investigate this case very dicretely well I know how you feel about this child I know that you worked so hard before you found that map it had a sentimental value for me professor it was my first find as an archeologist I know, let's just hope for the best that the NBI will solve that problem my only consolation is... I am sure that the one who got the map will also have a big problem what problem? -ouch! -you stop that... you're reading German but what's written there is Latin! you're just pretending, you just only read comics! it's like German, so it's Latin. could you two stop. what ever we do, we won't understand that I think that is really Latin and an old Philippines map was used you're good boss! how did you know that? there is only one way for us to use that map -what is it boss? -what is it boss? you know Emong, it would be better if you just surrender what? just to be imprisoned again no way rather that you are always leaving, I get nervous when you always leave but sweetheart, my life inside is uncertain it's better this way we are always together it's up to you go on, eat up. try to get full, because later you'll be very hungry for sure you're so indecent! you're in front of the food saying such things! you stop that! promise me Emong... don't you do that... drop that! drop it! or that will be your last dinner, the food you're eating looks so good throw it!

I get irritated to you -you are so persistant -I am not insisting anything to you I just care for you don't you shout at me! I am not deaf that's what the problem with you, you are always shouting the problem with you is that you are so ill-tempered maybe you are in love with me? what?! what did you say?! you don't know what you are talking about -I know what I am talking about -you are making my skin crawl -I know -be ashamed with your skin! admit it, I already heard it we are the only ones here I won't tell anyone you make my skin crawl! five minutes what five minutes? -five minutes, I will go to my hut -then? you will follow me you are pittyfull you are really confident five minutes five minutes? -I'll wait for you? -alright it's up to you you are the one who can't take it. you're the one who will... -five -five minutes call, five huh? five minutes five minutes! five minutes five minutes you can't endure that rude guy I think our man will be humiliated no, she is just embarassed maybe I should go there? I will never be your lover the way you look conceited what's taking him so long? maybe she commited suicide, why would she commit suicide? maybe because... she is embarassed to admit that she likes me so much... and she is the woman, and she will come to me that crazy fool he is playing hard though he is the one who likes me it is very obvious you will give in I don't want to wait for a man like that it's not in my vocabulary I'll just go to sleep he probably went to sleep? Mr. DJ can I make a request... I am still young, ain't I? I am also sexy it's up to him, he will loose something valuable there are many bedbugs inside the hut I have a stiff neck will it rain? I am talking to myself how many stars are there in the sky? my grandfather said it's around... there's a lot out there why are you answering me?

I haven't even combed yet bedbugs is it? why are you laughing? how many minutes is it? one minute to go you're in shame, aren't you? the stars so then, the news I heard was right it's true captain we didn't just talk to one person who knows that the are trouble going on here and it's true that Rufo is here in our province according to our information... there is a woman who is involved here... according to the witness, looks like she is from Manila what I am thinking is that we have no idea on what will be their next move it is better that you observe the group of Rufo also with Daniel but don't be obvious if my hunch is right... a huge amount of money is involved on the movement of Rufo's group Daniel? do you have a problem? none, why did you ask? nothing, lately I have noticed that you were too quite it's just acting, for a change elder brother told me a lot of things about you oh my, I hope the only good things were told to you all the good things about you Daniel thank goodness because you have seen all the bad things about me but I there are still a lot of things I don't know about you. haven't I? like what? your past, your family. like those why? wasn't that what elder brother had told you? I had insisted but he said that it would be better if you will be the one to tell me there isn't anything good about my story an ordinary life of a soldier you're a soldier? it was long ago why did you leave the service? it's a long story I will listen I had lost my will to live when my family was killed of all the days that we would be attacked why it had to be the day my wife and child visited me at our detachment and what's painfull was I was not able to defend them because I was the first to get hit Daniel! mother? mother! mother! father! father! please no! I was also mocked by a leutenant he killed my family in front of me please no! please no! they said I was the only one who lived in our group they burned the whole detachment I never found the bodies of my wife and child because when we returned to the place, all we found was ashes that's all that I can remember when I woke up I was already here in this tribe I was rescued by Elder Brother along with the other people here I resigned from service... here is where I returned...
