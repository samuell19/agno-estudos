[BELLS CHIMING] [WAVES LAPPING GENTLY] [♪♪♪] MARY [VOICE-OVER]: Long ago, in the time of Caesar Augustus, and in the land of Judah, ruled by the evil King Herod, there lived a young woman named Mary, who didn't know yet that she was chosen by God to fulfill an ancient prophecy to bring forth a promised king sent to save the world. [♪♪♪] Far away in the East, there were three kings of the Order of the Magi, who knew of this prophecy. For many years, these Magi had been searching for a certain star to appear, signaling the arrival of this divine child. What? MARY [VOICE-OVER]: Balthazar was well known for his ability to read and chart the stars. Gaspar! Mommy? Quickly! Come! MARY [VOICE-OVER]: And this Magi, Gaspar, was easily the greatest scholar in all the lands. The juxtaposition of the celestial alignment between Cronus and Ares, both the deferent and the epicycle model, show the same zodiacal positions of the five planets! Repeat the middle part again, if you will. The star. Just come look at the star! See for yourself. Oh. [HIGH-PITCHED GRUNT] Oh, goodness. MARY [VOICE-OVER]: The moment was finally here. Goodness! They had to be there when it happened. This is it! MARY [VOICE-OVER]: Oh, yes, then there was Melchior. Melchior! He was the map man. A great navigator. And, well, he liked to eat-- a lot. Show us this land called Judah. Here. Precisely. Judah. That's really far. Are you certain? Those are King Herod's lands. You, don't insult me. And, you, get me a kebab... MARY [VOICE-OVER]: It was time to pack the tent and assemble the caravan. As the Magi set out to find this young mother, they could only wonder... What mighty queen was chosen for this great honor? Giving birth to the Son of God. ♪ O come, O come ♪ ♪ Emmanuel ♪ ♪ Shall come to us ♪ ♪ O Israel ♪ [♪♪♪] ♪ Come, all you faithful ♪ ♪ Joyful, triumphant ♪ ♪ O come ♪ ♪ To Bethlehem ♪ [SINGERS VOCALIZING] ♪ Sing, choirs of angels ♪ ♪ Sing exultations ♪ ♪ O come ♪ ♪ To Bethlehem ♪ [SINGERS VOCALIZING] ♪ Sing hallelujah ♪ ♪ For unto us a ♪ ♪ Child is born ♪ ♪ Join every nation ♪ ♪ In celebration ♪ ♪ A child is born ♪ ♪ He is come ♪ ♪ Come, o come ♪ ♪ Emmanuel ♪ ♪ He is come ♪ ♪ Come, o come ♪ ♪ Emmanuel ♪ ♪ He is come ♪ ♪ Come, o come ♪ ♪ Emmanuel ♪ ♪ He is come. ♪ [SINGERS VOCALIZING] [SONG ENDS] Every girl I know helped choose their husband.

But what about my dream of becoming a teacher, like my father? You are fortunate anyone will have you, with all your crazy ideas. Crazy ideas? You're the reason I have these crazy ideas. You put them into my head by having me study these Scriptures, day after day, year after year. Because I did not have a son to teach them to. So now you punish me for it? You are a girl. You will be a wife, not a teacher, as tradition demands. As you wish, Father. [DOOR OPENS] [♪♪♪] [WHISPERING]: Oh, Fig. This isn't fair. [FIG WHINNIES SOFTLY] Mary, can we talk about this? I'm going to town, Deborah. Rebekah, we're going shopping. [GASPS] That isn't... That's not what I said. She needs to find fabric for her betrothal gown. [GRUNTS] [BRAYING] MARY [VOICE-OVER]: But I don't want to marry for duty. I want to marry for love. Most girls look forward to marriage. Love takes time to grow, Mary. Mm-hmm. Like a flower. Your husband might be handsome, exciting, wonderful. [RHYTHMIC SCRAPING, TAPPING] He might be a very good dancer.

To their blah, blah, blah, blah. Rome. You know? Rome. [LAUGHING]: Rome. Father, we-we cannot just ignore Caesar. [STAMMERS] A census would only anger the people.

Oh, no, no, no, no. They amuse me. Uh, they are nice people. Father. [SIGHS] I have concerns that Rome will hear about this unrest and... Well, I have concerns that you don't know what it means to be a king. I... A king doesn't need to be loved. Only obeyed and feared. I live only to serve my king, not to be one.

This looks more like a wedding than a simple betrothal ceremony. What better way for our families to meet than a party? Rachel. It's Rahel. It is so nice to finally meet you. We are delighted to accept your daughter into our family. No, the joy is ours. We don't feel as if we are losing a daughter but gaining a son. Until now, I have been severely outnumbered. And how is Mary feeling about the betrothal? Mary? Oh. [LAUGHS, STAMMERS] She couldn't be happier. Why make any plans if everything's decided for me? Sometimes God's plans for us are even bigger than we can imagine. You must let your faith guide you. I wish I had your faith. Oh, but you do. Do you know why your father spent so much time with you on the Scriptures, Mary? Because he didn't have a son to teach them to. No. Because he saw how strong your faith was. And because he has always known you are special. Nothing will change that, Mary. Not even this young man. Joseph. My son. I wonder if he's cute. [JOSEPH GRUNTING] JOACHIM: Oh, nice to meet you. JOSEPH [MUFFLED]: Very nice to meet you, too. So, Joachim, shall we proceed with the ceremony? But yes. Uh, yes, of course. Deborah, tell Mary we are ready. The music. Play. [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] They're ready for you, Mary. REBEKAH: You look beautiful. You're going to be so happy. He is very handsome. We are almost finished. This was my mother's.

[BOTH CHUCKLE] Thanks be to God! ALL: Thanks be to God. Joseph. Hi, Mary. Oh. I'm... Joseph. You? And you. They know each other? A man of many skills. JOSEPH: Yeah. Uh, you're welcome. You were also betrothed? Uh... Mary? Do you need to take a walk? Great idea, Mother. [CROWD MURMURING] MAN: What? Uh, so what exactly do I do now? You go after her. All right. There. Okay. [CHUCKLES] To life. ALL: To life! Mary. Please don't chase me. I'm not. I'm not chasing you. I just... Okay, wow, you walk fast. [PANTING] For a girl? No. What? No. For anyone who walks. Look. Mary, we are supposed to be talking, okay? We're supposed to be getting to know each other. We're betrothed. And you spent considerable amount of effort in the marketplace charming a girl who informed you that she was betrothed. You were charmed? I was cornered. [CHUCKLES] Mary. Look, I'm just friendly. So friendly that you forgot to mention that you were also betrothed, while offering a different girl gifts. Well, actually, it-it turns out it was the same girl, so... May I just point out, you... weren't exactly unfriendly. I was being polite while trying to escape. If you can walk this fast, escaping should not have been a problem. Mary, they are back there planning our wedding right now. Yes, they are. So what do we, Mary? I don't know, Joseph. My whole life, I wanted to be a teacher. And then one day marry someone who I actually love. [SMACKS LIPS] Yeah, well, you know, this wasn't in my plans either, okay? I-I'm an inventor. I'm coming up with ideas that could change the world, but my father said, "You're getting married, son," and that's the end of it. I'm sorry. Are you even hearing me right now? Mary.

Your cousin Elizabeth, even in her old age, is with child this very moment. "Jesus"? [♪♪♪] That's... that's the... The promised king. [SIGHS] I am not in the least bit worthy. You are more blessed than any other woman, Mary. Who would... who would believe me? They'll think I'm crazy. Or worse. And-and-and Joseph. I mean, what betrothed man would want to hear that his wife-to-be is already pr... pregnant. Rise, Mary. You are to be the mother to a savior and king. [PANTS] You cower before no one. Wait, wait-wait-wait-wait. I have, I have so many questions. [PANTING] [EERIE VOICES WHISPERING] [HEROD GROANING] [ECHOING]: Get out! [VOICES STOP] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] JOACHIM [VOICE-OVER]: This is madness. Our minds play tricks on us at night. This wasn't a dream. The angel was there. It was Gabriel. Madness. The Son of God? Those words alone are dangerous. People are stoned for that kind of blasphemy. Father, those are the words the angel spoke to me. No more talk of angels. What if it's true? How can it be? Have I ever lied to any of you? I must pray to merciful God for guidance. No one speaks of this to anyone. To anyone! MARY: This wasn't a dream. What? [JOSEPH STAMMERS] What are you saying? I'm telling you the truth. An angel came to me. He said I would give birth to the Son of God. Do you even hear yourself? [SCOFFS] Is marrying me so bad that you had to make up a story like this to get out of it? I know it sounds impossible. It doesn't sound impossible, Mary. It is impossible. What did you expect me to say, "congratulations"? You can say you believe me. RAHEL: Joseph cannot help you. Mary, tell them this is just a joke. I'm with child. It's not like what you think, I promise. He won't be sullied by this. He's a good young man. P-Please, if I can just explain more of what the angel said. Oh, yes, the angel. We won't listen to more of this blasphemy. I won't have it. Let's just, let's just take a walk. RAHEL: Leave him alone. JACOB: Enough. You must leave. Joseph, please. JACOB: Get out. Please don't come here again. [MARY SIGHS] Joseph. JACOB: Get out. [DOOR CLOSES] [♪♪♪] But I can care for Mary here. No, Mary's right. It is better for all of us if she goes to stay with Elizabeth.

We must meet the king of this land. He will have the scrolls we need to find the child. [MOCKING GRUNT] Obviously. Then let's go. Hey. Listen. It's date palm season. It happens once a year. Melchior, we must go. But I'm saying that I know a place nearby where they've got the fat, juicy ones. Fresh. Smell great. Goodness. Shame! They're fresh. Shame! What's the matter with you? You are a Magi. You would miss the birth of the Son of God? Jerusalem. I'm talking about Jerusalem. What is in Jerusalem? King Herod! Your scrolls! My dates! Now stop yelling at me!

[CAMEL GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] Zachariah still hasn't said a word. From the moment he learned of my pregnancy, he hasn't been able to speak. Oh. I was shocked at first. But now I think I may have been given yet another gift. Apparently his ears still work. [SIGHS] Elizabeth, who am I to raise this baby? Maybe my father is right. This is madness. You were chosen for reasons that, one day, even your father will understand. When will I understand? If my husband could talk, he would say, "Patience is a good companion for faith." Mary. Why didn't Joseph bring you? This is more than he can accept. I don't believe you're meant to be alone. Then why did God have me promised to a man that doesn't want to believe me? JOSEPH: Why does part of me want to believe her? It's like I'm being torn in two. Joseph, it is over. I feel like I've done something wrong. This is her doing, not yours.

Why are you in my lands? We have come from far away to worship a divine king that is to be born in your lands. A star appeared to us, one we've been searching for our entire lives. A star. Yes. It led us here, sire. We believe the time is nigh. Which means soon. It may also explain your... recent dreams, sire. You told them about my nightmares? I've not heard of any queen visiting this kingdom. Who is the mother? Now we believe that he is to be born not of a queen, but of a humble virgin. Where might we find this, uh, humble mother? We've been trying to unravel that very mystery, Your Magnificence. But we are missing certain ancient scrolls. BALTHAZAR: We need your help, sire, to find the child. And why would I help you to find a new king in my kingdom? [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] Eh. He's got a point, right? [SHOUTS] Well, when you put it that way.

I've heard from reliable sources in Hebron that a certain young woman with child might be living on this farm. We've been searching for her for weeks. [GASPS] As you can see, sire, whoever told you that must be blind. No, the woman I seek is unmarried and much younger. She's in no danger. You don't mind if we have a look around? Of course. You're our guest. [CLUCKING] ANTIPATER: You live quite modestly. God has blessed us, for which we are grateful. [WHISPERING]: Just trust me. There's no need to be nervous. Is there? [BRAYING] If you do see this young woman... ...you will report it. Then my father, King Herod, will bless you. Your generosity is appreciated. [JOSEPH SIGHS] ELIZABETH: Mary. [JOSEPH GRUNTS] You're welcome. Joseph, my betrothed. MARY: So you're here because of a dream? JOSEPH: Yes. No. Uh... Mary, I'm here because I'm supposed to be with you. I should have never let you go. You owe me nothing. [SIGHS] Please, Mary. Come back to Nazareth with me. You heard him. He said he was looking for a young, unwed pregnant woman. Listen to Joseph, Mary. He was a royal. A son of King Herod. Those exact soldiers were in my dream. That's no coincidence. You are in danger, Mary. Herod must know of the prophecy. He wants my child. We're getting married. Great. Great, yes. Um, yes. I... We will go to Nazareth in the morning to make arrangements, and I... I will claim this child as my own. No, we're getting married right here. Today. Uh, well... What about our fathers? They called off the wedding. What about our mothers? They would... they would want to be here. We can't wait, Joseph. When I'm married, my child is safe. Will you marry me, Joseph? I do. I will. Yes. Of course. Yes. Um... Who's gonna marry us? A priest. Stop. Stop being such an a...

Are you no closer to learning where this king will be born? We are patient men. My father is not. You seem... tense. Have some wine. I do not need wine. I need answers. I don't understand your obsession with this peasant and her baby. You are rich kings. What we seek cannot be purchased with riches. Then what do you seek? Wisdom. Truth. And the very meaning of life. What meaning is there in groveling to a peasant baby? You are meant to be worshipped, not to worship others. The meaning of life comes not from what others do for us, but what we do for others. King or peasant, we will all one day bend the knee. What could this child possibly offer that my father does not already have? Well, how about... I don't know, a good night's sleep? My father wants the mother found! GASPAR: We'll do our best. [STAMMERS] That was my favorite vintage. Are you certain the child will be born in Bethlehem? Oh, goodness, I'm quite certain. Well, clearly, we must find the mother before they do. [♪♪♪] ANTIPATER: The Magi are gone. They must have left in the night. HEROD: What do you mean they're gone? ANTIPATER: I have reports of them heading toward Bethlehem. That must be where the mother is. I will go after them. I-I thought you scoured Bethlehem. No one matching her description was there. Well... [SIGHS] then... [GRUNTS] take your men back to Bethlehem and-and kill every pregnant woman and baby you find. Problem solved. Father. No. [GRUNTS] I... We cannot do that. Why not? What if... all of Judea revolts against you? Rome may question your sanity. My sanity. My sanity is why I need to rid myself of these nightmares. There is another way, Father. Well? Then tell me, my son. [CHUCKLES] What would you do if you were king? Use Rome to your advantage. If Caesar wants a census, give it to him. [ECHOING]: Continue! A census allows for your soldiers to search every home and count every head, all in the name of Caesar. The woman will be found. And Rome will be appeased. [GRUNTS] [HEROD GRUNTS] Order the census. But if you don't find her, kill them all. Show me you can be a true king. You are no different than me, boy. My blood runs through your veins.

I think even Fig is beginning to tolerate you. Wow. Must be really good stew. [BANGING ON DOOR] SOLDIER: Open up! [BANGING CONTINUES] [JOSEPH SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS] Whoa. E-Excuse me. Who are you? I'm here by order of Caesar for the census. [DOOR CLOSES] Name. I am Joseph, son of Jacob. Place of birth. Nazareth? I'm from Bethlehem. Then by order of Caesar, you and your family must travel to Bethlehem and be counted. [JOSEPH SCOFFS] Immediately. Sir, my wife is with child. As you can see, she is in no condition to travel that far. There are no exceptions. She is a Nazarene. Surely, she can stay with her mother this close to giving birth. Your wife goes with you to Bethlehem or she will give birth in a dungeon. No. No. Please. Of course, we will leave first thing in the morning. We will be back to make sure of it. [DOOR CLOSES] CENSUS TAKER: All right, move on. [SCOFFS] CENSUS TAKER: To the next one. Bethlehem is more than a week's journey. I don't know if you can do this. I'll be okay. You heard him, Joseph. We have to go. [SIGHS] I will make preparations. [DOOR OPENS] [SIGHS] [DOOR CLOSES] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] That's the way into Bethlehem. Stay here. SOLDIER: Step up. You, step up. [SIGHS] SOLDIER: Hurry up. What is it? What did you see? He's here. Herod's son. [JOSEPH SIGHING] This isn't safe, Joseph. It's probably just the census. We're married now. I think it'll be okay. No. It's me they're looking for, I know it. [GRUNTING] What is it? What? We have to hurry. I can't have the baby here, Joseph. Bethlehem isn't safe. Joseph... We can't go back. Mary, I'm sorry. I promised to protect you, and I failed you in every possible way. Joseph! I'm not the only one who was chosen for this. [GRUNTING] I know another way in. I'll get you to my mother. She will help us. Fig. [CLICKS TONGUE] Come on. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Our wait is over. Tonight is the night, gentlemen. Yes. Finally. Oh, goodness. No, no, no, no, no. [GROANS] My clothes smell of sheep dung. My skin smells of sheep dung. This whole earth is made of sheep dung. And tonight, I meet the Son of God. This is just perfect. We must ready ourselves. Oh, hello. Son of God, let me introduce myself. I am the King of Sheep Dung. Yes, I have a few hygiene issues right now. Nice to meet you. [WHISPERING]: That tunnel's the only way in. What are you doing? I'm creating a distraction. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] What are you doing? Creating a distraction. Mary. Mary. That's... [GRUNTS] [ROCK CLATTERS] Uh... [DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE] Oh. [WHISPERING]: Now's our chance. Let's go. Wait, wait. What about Fig? He won't fit. Don't worry. He'll find me. He always does. [♪♪♪] [SPUTTERING] [♪♪♪] [GROANING SOFTLY] Let me make sure it's safe. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] We can't go to my parents. What? There's more soldiers. Joseph, we have to hurry. Okay. Stay here. Joseph, wait. Jo... Joseph. [PANTS] [PAINED GROANING] I'm asking you if you could find it in the kindness in your heart to please just provide... No. Sorry, I cannot. ...a safe place for us to stay tonight. We'd be out... [MARY GROANING] [KNOCKING] [MOANING] SOLDIER: Hey, you! Wait. You! Stop! No, no, no. Sorry. We have no room. Hey! [BRAYING] [GROANS] [BRAYS SOFTLY] Thank you, Fig. JOSEPH: What happened?

[GASPING] What do you want? We have no quarrel with you, sire. I want to talk. You leave her alone. Who is the father? I am. No, you're not. It seems you found your king. The child is no threat to your father. My father would heartily disagree. GABRIEL [VOICE-OVER, ECHOING]: You cower before no one. So you are the one who's caused so much trouble. And this child is the new king of Judea? He hasn't come for your father's throne. What kind of king does not want a throne and is born in a place like this? One who has come to save the lost. Am I lost? "Like sheep we have all gone astray. And God has put on him..." "...the punishment for all the evil we have done." Yes, I know your Scriptures as well. So, you truly believe that this child... ...born in this filth... is the chosen one? A king. [♪♪♪] I believe you know exactly who he is. I envy your faith. Faith is trusting what you know in your heart to be true. [THUDDING] Well done, sire. You found them. Yes, I did. Do we seize them or end them now? You have your faith, but I have my orders. You have a choice. You are not your father. [SHUDDERED BREATHING] SOLDIER: Sire? JOSEPH: Please. ANTIPATER: Men. Please. Sire? You will give them safe passage. What? They are now under my protection. The king's orders were clear. These people are no threat to a true king. Sire. You heard me. Leave us. Yes. Of course. You must leave Judea at once. When my father hears of this, I cannot protect you. Thank you. What is his name? Jesus. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] [SOLDIERS MARCHING AWAY] I always knew I liked him. [FIG SNORTS] MELCHIOR: He came. He saw. He went. And so should we. BALTHAZAR: You heard the man. Gather your things. MELCHIOR: Did you hear him say "Judea"? What's this Judea business? It's Judah. JOSEPH: I had another dream. We have to get to Egypt. [♪♪♪] Ugar is over there. You come down to Nagur. Ha, ha, ha. From Ugar you go to Beinangnin... MARY [VOICE-OVER]: So the family prepared to travel to Egypt, knowing they would not be safe at home as long as Herod was alive. MELCHIOR: Oh, Judah's there. Yes. Yes. JOSEPH: Yeah. So you are in... Why don't I just take... Why don't... Yeah. MARY [VOICE-OVER]: But first, the Magi had gifts to present. Gifts that would be very useful for the journey ahead. Please accept this gold for food and shelter. You are too generous, sir. This resin of frankincense will soothe the baby during your travels. It smells wonderful. And this is myrrh. It does everything else. Wh... [CHUCKLES] BALTHAZAR: But, really, what does myrrh actually do? It does everything. [STAMMERS] You-you cannot quantify what one amount of myrrh does. Goodness, please stop with the myrrh. Nobody cares about myrrh. What are you saying? Just because you're jealous because you gave them a basic gift, and I gave them something to talk about, multifaceted... [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] [♪♪♪] You're welcome. [CHUCKLES] [BOTH CHUCKLING] [FIG BRAYING] [♪♪♪] MARY [VOICE-OVER]: And as her new family made their way, she knew that her mother had been right. God's plans for her were bigger than she could have ever imagined. JOSEPH [VOICE-OVER]: Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. That is not how I remember it. I kissed you first. That is the story of how you came to us. Time for your Scripture lesson. And then it's off to bed. Okay.
