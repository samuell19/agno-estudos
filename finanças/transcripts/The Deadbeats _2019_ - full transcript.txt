Okay, okay, I wanna introduce you guys to a very special entertainer, all the way from the high seas of the Caribbean, Mr. Patch the Magical Pirate Clown. - Arr, you landlubbers. Me gold real heavy, I'm glad to put it down. Are you all ready for a magic show? Yay! - Now before we get started, I got a joke for all of you. How much does it cost a pirate to get his ears pierced? Buck an ear. All righty, how many of you like to juggle? All right, well I'll be doing the juggling. All right, everybody, I'm going to do my best with one eye. Used to have two, but I lost the other one out to sea. So bear with me. Whoa! - All right, we're gonna sing a little song together, everybody. Are you all pirates like me?

You were dreaming about me, weren't you? - How'd you know I was asleep? Because you're a bum and you're always sleeping. So were you? - Was I what? Dreaming about me. - No, I think I was dead. I was on this foreign planet. Everything had this purple hue to it. I was playing Frisbee with this little girl, who I think was supposed to be my kid in the dream, and she kind of reminded me of my mom. Wow, that's a good one. It almost gets me to believe that mankind does possess an eternal soul. - Whether or not mankind does possess an eternal soul can't be answered in one lifetime. Human life is finite. We live, and we die. It's only through knowledge we can attain life, though. - Yeah. But what is it for? I don't know. Enough philosophical bullshit. I haven't had breakfast yet. Do you have any cheese? - No. I'm sure Drake does. You wanna give him a call? See if he'll come pick us up, we can arrange for food and he can get us high? - Okay. I'm sure he'll oblige. - {Shelly] Always does. Loyal Drake. So I'll see you soon? - Yeah. That is if I don't die in the next few hours. Okay, whatever, Kyle, goodbye. Can I get you kids anything? - No, Mom. When's the party clown gonna get here? - Now that is a good question. He should be here any minute now. Tell you what, let's do another game of pin the tail on the donkey. - I think that we're all bored of that game. - Yeah, can we just hit the pinata now? - Honey, I thought you wanted to save that for last. It's my birthday. - Okay, tell you what, give the clown five more minutes, and then, if he's not here, you kids can whack the donkey. - Okay, whatever. - Tom, I need you to call the clown guy. The kids are getting restless over here. - Why can't you just do it? - Because you're the one who booked him, and I've got kids to entertain over here. - Fine. Hello. Yeah, hey, this is Tom Flannigan. I booked a clown for my daughter's birthday party. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm just now pulling into the neighborhood. I should be pulling up soon. Okay. The kids are getting restless, so make it quick. - Arr. Arr. Arr.

Now, I want you all to pay attention to what I'm about to do. Now where did it go, you might be thinking. - No one cares. - But what you should be thinking is what has it turned into? Now, who's the special birthday girl today? - I am. - Well then, this is for you. Thanks, I guess? - All right, now for my next magic trick. - No, do something funny. You're not very funny for a clown. - So it's comedy you want. - No, I want you to juggle stuff. It's my birthday, and I want you to juggle stuff. - Juggling it is. Oops. It seems as though I dropped one. - This guy sucks. He isn't funny and he can't even juggle right. - Arr, matey. Pull me finger. - Are you kidding me? You can't do that. This is a children's birthday party. - Honey, honey, honey, I'm sure Patch Master didn't mean any harm. - It's Patch, you knucklehead, the Magical Pirate Clown. Arr. - Hey, don't get testy with me, asshole. I'm the one paying for everything. - Tom, your language! You're being a worse example than he is. - Now for my next trick. No, we want the pinata! Pinata, pinata, pinata, pinata! - Okay! - Pinata. - So it's the pinata you want then, you landlubbers. Well then the pinata it shall be. Arr, now who's first up to bat? Why don't you let someone else have a couple of swings? Give me the bat. You ever had your ass kicked by an adult? Are you ready? - Yeah. - Now go on, and give it a good whack! Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

Just fucking do it. Get it over with! - Actually, Kyle, I did not kill him. It was your creepy clown friend here who did it. - What the fuck, man? Why? Why? - You know, I really don't know what I'm going to be doing next, but I can tell you one thing, if you don't play along, the rest of your lives are going to do nothing but hurt real bad. Hit or stay? - Fuck you. - Hit or stay, last chance. Hit. - 20, not bad, not bad at all. Hit or stay? - Question. - Sure. - What the fuck are we playing for? - To see who gets the trip. - Trip, what trip? - You see, the winners get to take the Magic Mystery Shot. - What's in it? I can't tell you because it's a Magic Mystery Shot. Sorry. Hit or stay? - Hit me. - You gotta be kidding me, 21. - Winner, winner, chicken dinner. Beats me. - Chicken dinner, more like chicken shit! You stacked the deck. - It's your word against mine, Kyle. And I say you're a winner. In fact, you're both winners. Right? No, no, no, no, don't, don't touch her! Just give them both to me. Better yet, give them both to the fucking clown. - I'm afraid I can't do that, Kyle. Besides, if anybody around here needs a Magic Mystery Shot, it's Sleeping Beauty. Kind of boring, right? We're gonna be here for a while. Now you. - Fucking do it. You fucker! You gave us speed? - Just a little bit. I don't want you falling asleep. Might as well give him one, too, right? Don't want him to feel left out. - No, no, no, no! I won't say a word, I promise. - Shelly, Shelly, talk to me. - Don't, don't, don't. - What the fuck is going on? What's wrong with my arm? - Shelly, Shelly, we're in some shit, girl. This guy. - Okay, that's enough chit chat out of the two of you. We've got more games to play. - {Shelly] What the fuck is that? Fucking. - Good morning, darling. - Conway. Why is there a clown here? - I don't fucking know. He killed Drake. - Yeah, you know, I was actually wondering the same thing. Why are you here? - You guys want a hint? - No. - Hint away. - Look, look at the clown behind the wheel. He looks angry, let's piss him off more. Hey, Mr. Clown, you know how to make animal balloons? - No, no, no, you're not doing this because of that. No, are you fucking serious? - Dead fucking serious! - We were fucking stoned, man. We thought it was funny seeing a clown driving a car! - Ha, ha, ha, ha ha! - I don't mean to be rude, but I do have to interrupt this little getting to know you chit chat. - Okay. - Now, listen, we're going to play a really high stakes game of poker. And don't worry, Kyle, this time I won't stack the deck in my favor. Yeah, right. - What's he talking about, Kyle? - You were passed out. We played a round of blackjack. And he stacked the deck, and that's why we're all high as kites right now. - What are you gonna do now? Set us on fire? - No, nothing like that. - Oh, good. - Did you know that I used to be a dealer? Well, I mean, right, I am a dealer, right? But I used to be a dealer dealer in the city of sin. - Yeah, that was until he caught fucking stealing. - No, no, Kyle, you're the thief. I just needed a change of scenery. This is a true, straight-up game of chance. But this time, it's not the winners, it's the losers. - What do losers get? - The losers? The losers get to take the Speedball Challenge. - That doesn't sound like fun. I don't want that prize. - And the winners, what do the winners get? Very simple, the winner gets to sit out a round. - Do they have to sit? Can they run around the RV with an escort? - Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. - Big fucking prize, man. - All right, I'll tell you what, I'll sweeten the pot. - Oh, shit. - The winner gets to go home alive. Now, considering the three of you have just been shot up with a very, very intense dose of speed, I just have to ask the question, I mean, how much more do you think your little hearts can take, you know? I don't know. - Not much. - So no matter what, even if you play fair, one of us is getting the speedball? - Yeah. Yes, I mean, the math would dictate that. - You're fucking sick. - Well, that remains to be seen. Let's play some poker, what do you say? - Woo! - Fucking stupid. What are we betting with? - Brick, say what It over here has in that bag of tricks, will you? - Hey, get your hands off that. Balloons. You make balloon animals? - Yep. Pretty good. - Yeah? - Yeah, little fives. - Shelly, what would you like him to make for you? - A javelina. - A javelina, that's an interesting choice there, Shelly. Why'd you pick javelina? - It resembles you, your face, 'cause it's like a fucking wild pig. - Shh! - Okay. We'll see what he can do. - I'm gonna need both hands, yep. - Brick. No, wait, no. - We'll use the rest of those balloons as poker chips, though. - Arf, arf, arf. Woo! - That's beautiful. - You think so? - Your mother must be very proud. - Actually, she can't stand me. - All right, everybody gets two balloons each. The orange are worth five, the blue are worth 10, the purple are worth 20. Shelly, would you cut the deck, please? - Okay, cut them there, cut them thin, should've went, cut them deep, sleep in the street, cut them thin, should've went, cut them deep, sleep in the street. - Or buried at the bottom of a six foot grave covered in dirt. Right, that's the other. - Real promising, man. Thank you. - It didn't even rhyme. Everybody ante up five. Since we're all playing this hand, let's just go right to the flock, what do you say? - Yeah, yeah. - That is to you, my lady. - I'm in for 10. I'll call. - I call, as well. - Okay, okay, okay, here we go. Now, here comes the turn. - I'm in for 30. - What does it even matter? You stacked the deck anyways. - Fuck you! Fuck you! You fucking deadbeat, I already said that this is coming out clean. Don't fucking insult me again. - It's all right, Kyle, I'm watching real close. He's playing, he's playing clean, he's playing fair. - Guess I'll call. - Fuck you. I'm all in. - Okay, Chuckles, me too. - I guess that makes all three. - Mm, you feel that? You guys feel that? Isn't the anticipation just, just killing you? - Cut it with a knife. - Can't wait. - Here comes the last card. Here's the river. - Yes, winner, winner, chicken dinner! - All right, let's see who the losers are. - Boom. - Seven high straight. Can anybody beat that? - I sure can. - Son of a bitch. - Fucking pair. - Wow, lover boy, you are the winner, which means, of course, that the princess and the jester will need to take the Speedball Challenge. - No, no, no, no, no, I want to trade my pass. I want to take the challenge. - No, it just doesn't work that way. Remember, I said the losers take the challenge. - This isn't a game. You're fucking with our lives, man! - No, Kyle, this is a game, and it's my game. And I make the rules, which means that she's going to get the high of her life off of what you stole from me. - Conway, please, you know that we're sorry. I'm sorry. Whatever we did to piss you off, we'll make it better. - She's sorry, she's sorry, she's sorry. - Anything that you want. - This is what I want. I want us all to party. Conway, please, stop. - No, no! No, leave her alone! Get off of me! Fuck you! Fuck you. - Bozo, too. - Don't do it. - I don't know what to tell you, pal.
