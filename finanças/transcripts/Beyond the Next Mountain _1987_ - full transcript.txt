Look a lad to me. Twenty-two, Major. Twenty-two. You want to die in the jungle? I was in trade in bombs, a chemist. I had every reason to believe I would always be a chemist. Two years ago a great revival swept across Wales. Brought men to God. It brought me to India, Sir. To push your religion on some bloody savages who wouldn't know Jesus if He came down all ï¬aming white from those great windows in the Abby. The Bible charges us to go and tell, Major. The increase is not ours to give. You do-go-odors you come out here looking for God knows what, upset the order of things. I am here by God's grace, Sir. I have His permission. I am asking you for a guide to assist me up into the hills to make contact with the Hmar tribe. The Hmar's don't fancy visitors, particularly white visitors. They are quite likely to lop off your head. The man who hangs your likeness over his door also inherits your sen/ices as his personal slave for the next world. So you see, Roberts, they are already religious. Chalow, boy, Chalow! Listen to me lad, in 1871 the Hmars took 500 heads from our tea plantation in less than a day's ride from this station. Took two columns of Assam riï¬es to tidy up. That's a lesson. Colonial policy absolutely prohibits your mucking about with the tribals. You will leave this district at first light. You'll need the luck of the Devil to get back to Chittagong in one piece. I will need the leading of God, Sir. [ Music ] [bird and animal noises] [singing] Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah, children to this wondrous land" I am weak, but Thou art mighty; hold me in Thy powerful hand. Bread of heaven, bread of heaven, feed me now and evermore. Feed me now and evermore. [ suspenseful music ] Children to this wondrous land. [Forest noises] I am your brother. I bring an offering of peace from God. It is in this book. [ Music ] (Rochunga) In the years before I was born, my father told me of a white-skinned missionary who came to the Hmar people. He was called by our tribe Mr. Youngman, and the stories he told changed our ways forever. My father gave his name to Jesus in the time of Mr. Youngman. He was fifteen years old. Now I am his son... ...and he is the preacher on this mountain. The forest is our home and also the home of many wild animals. The Royal Bengal tiger lives in our woods. This morning I saw big tracks in the mud. We learn quickly that a tiger talks with his tail. If he does not put it all the way under his legs, then you know he wants you for food. [Tiger roaring] [Elephants trumpeting] Herds of wild elephants pass near our village, or right through it, if they get angry. The elephants tail also speaks to us. If it is up, you should be gone. It can squash a man before he can run. [Elephants trumpeting] When we have church, I often think of Mr. Youngman. I wonder why he left us. Why he never returned to our hills. Monkeys are like noisy children. They like to follow me everywhere. If you climb up a tree and swing with them, they think you are a monkey and go away. [Monkey noises] Unless... [ Suspenseful music] [commotion amongst villagers] Governor has sent for you, Chawnga. [commotion amongst villagers] Pal! [ Music ] But if colonial policy is to permit these tribesmen the liberty of preaching the Christian gospel any way they please, I cannot issue a permit for you to go into those hills. Then the Christians in those tribes should be moved down into the valley where my people can keep an eye on them. Ah, biscuit, Dr. Abernathy? What ma'am? Biscuit? Oh, thank you. Back home we call these little things cookies. [ Music ] I've heard a lot about you, Chawnga. My people have given me full reports on your activities in those hills. Yes, they have. lengti ziem a na? Speaks only Hmar, Sir. Have the guard translate for you. Ask this man, who gave him permission to preach the gospel to his tribe. Engtin nge Christian I lo ni? [Horse huffs] Pakar Ha, pairs" Ha! Chawnga says that in the year of the Flowering Bamboo, a white missionary who knew the Lushai language came to the Hmar people. Missionary? Yes, Sir. This missionary lived with the Hmar in the Hmar village and ate the Hmar food and wore the Hmar tribal clothes. Missionary Roberts, Welshman, some years ago, defied orders. Sneaked into the hills without a permit. When they caught him, he'd already gone native. Tell this good man that we're here to take the place of this missionary... Roberts. Roberts. Tell him that we will build a church for the Hmar Christians. Welsh Missionary Roberts ai awh turin kan lo kal ania. Biakin kan sak ang a, Hmar mipuite tan malsawmna tamtak kan thlen tir dawn ani. chu an mani in enkawl ani. Chawnga says that to the Hmar people, no one can take the place of missionary Roberts. The greatest blessing you can bestow upon the Hmar people is to let them alone. Excuse me. You and your people shall accept the help offered by Dr. Abernathy. Translate! Kristian lawmna riltu neiin in pawn tur ani a, eng pawh nise in pom reng reng a ngai. Pathian a choh in tranpuina kan beisei ang. He says that he will accept help only from God. [Yelling and commotion] Joytie, Joytie! A boy, ma'am. From the tribe. Yes, yes I know. Put him down please. Pal! Quick, quick Joytie... Pa]! Pa]! Pal! Pal! Pal! [ Soft music ] Pa, why did they beat you? They do not know our ways. They think Hmar people are like animals in the forest. If only Mr. Youngman could come back. He would tell us what to do. He not coming back, boy. Never. He gone from India, many years. Gone? But why? If we are to be free, someone must help us now. Someone who knows our ways. This person must write God's book in Hmar language. Can you do it, my father? I have not the learning. There must be someone who is proud to be Hmar. How much learning would be needed? There ls school In Churachandpur, 96 miles through the morning sun. They would know the answer. Cross valley. Many days journey is tea plantation of the English. There, your grandfather and other Hmar warriors took many heads in battle. And can you see far end of valley, another mountain? Oh yes, Pa. I have seen it many times. If you climb to top of far mountain, what would you see? You will see still, another mountain. And can you see top of mountain, where sky touches the earth? Yes. It is called by men the horizon. Wherever you journey my son, the horizon is always just in front of you, beyond the next mountain. God's love is like the horizon, always there waiting for us, leading us on. Pa, Pa. I want to give my name to Jesus for this learing. I will follow Him to the horizon. That night, my father gave me his only rupee. In the outside world he said a rupee could be traded for many things. [Female speaking Hmar language] My mother did not sleep the night before my journey. She prayed for my safety but she could not hold me with her eyes. [Speaking Hmar language] [Elephants trumpeting] If elephant chases you, run straight ahead, then make sharp turn to right, straight again, and another right. Four times and you will be back on your path. His trunk will smash me in a tree. All elephants left-handed. They cannot turn quickly to right. Always they fall to the ground when they try. It takes an elephant long time to get up, son. You will be far away. Remember, Satan is like rouge elephant. He is left-handed, too. In outside world he will try to lead you into sin. When evil tempts you, tell Jesus about it and He will tumble Satan on his back. Will I know, Pa? When I am tempted? You will know. God keep you. Pal! I could not shame my father to look back a second time, but I strongly felt a need for this. Deep in the forest, great pythons hang like tree branches. When you pass below, they drop without a sound and make rings around you. Their muscles ripple and bulge and they can swallow you whole. Oh Lord what learning could be mine in a great snake's belly? My mother gave me rice for the first night of my journey to the outside world. How did she know I would be too frightened to hunt? My father says, all the animals in the forest are created by God. That He gave each their ways. Would He favor me over the night creatures that sounded so hungry? [ Music ] [Tiger roaring] [ Suspenseful music] [ Music ] [Monkey noises] Where was the outside world? [Students singing] [Teacher and students reciting the alphabet] [Children laughing] Rochunga, you please stand up and can you read this? God... is our refuge and strength. Very good. Your English is very good and someday you will become a good teacher to teach English to the tribal children. [Rochunga and students reciting the alphabet] Very good, very good. Isaac. Name is calling you Isaac, what name is calling me? Rochunga. Yes. Name is calling me Rochunga. What other name is calling me? Isaac? Other name is calling me teacher. Seasons mark years for Hmar people. Each Spring we take land from forest for rice planting. Spring of 1942, stories reached our village of great noise that came down from the sky. Workers who were there, when the noise passed said it was all over them. The outside world had found our hills. Japanese were the terribles from a far away country. They marched across the boarder of Burma into India. Rumors said a mad chief called Hitler was going to kill every race. And Japanese were with him. Allied forces said they had come to help us. But when we tried to speak against them, they show us power of their guns. [Gun blast] [Commotion amongst villagers] Hmar people had not seen so many white faces. And for first time we thought how to lock doors and hide our women and children. Captain Surgian? Who is it? I found a tribal who speaks English, Sir. Are you sure he's not armed? Unarmed, Sir. Very well. Send him in. Do you speak English? What is your name? Rochunga. Now you listen to me very carefully. We're dug in here with orders to maintain strict radio silence. Do you follow me? Let me put it another way. Can you find your way about well, in these jungles? [ Music ] [Soldiers conversing - dogs barking] Message! [gun cocked] [Gunfire] Wet. Legible. Very good. Very well done. Ah, yes. Well, even soldiers get paid, so I'm prepared to give you a little something. One. Two. They're yours. You've earned them. These are a wartime scarcity. They're as rare as gold. And you know it. One, two. Tumara nam ki? Do you speak English? I do not understand you. I do speak English. No, no, no don't leave yet. I could buy you a cup of tea. But the tea here is tasteless. All the good tea goes to the soldiers. Shortages. Now at this very moment, I could be enjoying this cigarette, but then I would have nothing. But in a fortnight, I could make twice as much money with this, as I gave you. What are you going to do with your rupees? Now, I know you understand me because you are a businessman. You can make more rupees with those. Rupees save for school. Forget your school, man. Now I have a friend, a nice chap, a fisherman who lives up the river. Now he's got a boat, a large boat, but very little else, he's a poor man. Now yesterday, I saw some dead mules. Army mules. Bloated, floating down the river. How they died, I don't know, but I can speculate. Floating along side the dead mules were rock sacks, crates, barrels, Armies! So my friend loaded them onto his boat, almost a day's work. Now he would have gladly given them to me but he's a poor man and he expected something for his labor. I've seen those goods with my own eyes. But I have no rupees. Malaria pills, people are desperate for Malaria pills. But who can afford them? School, huh? Saving for school. [ Music ] Hello, Mr. Yankee! How do you do, Sir? What would you like? This? Hello, Tommy Boy! Hello! Hello, Tommy Boy. You want something? Anything you want is here. [ Parade music ] Smile Rochunga, look happy! Smile and our sales will go up. Where is your patriotism, son? What's the matter? Are you ill? Is he one of your people? Lekhabu tamtak dawra a um a. He says we have many books in our store. Hmar tawngin lekhabu inchawk ka nuom. He says he wants to buy book in Hmar language. Pa. Pa... ...please. How was your journey? Still takes five days. All of the rivers have not moved. Tea is very good here, Pa. Like rich merchant. Please. Pa, I've lived with soldiers. I know what money's doing. That much I learned from war. And now war is finished. All Hmar people know, Chawnga's son not student. Pa. I can't be just forest. Last month, I saw Shillong. I even ride bus in lmphal. You give coin to driver and wheels take you everywhere. When I was a boy, you told me you work all day in outside world for one quarter rupee. Your son has 100 rupees. And he will have more. Does Jesus still have your name? Last Sabbath day, I preach about flood in time of Noah. Sanglien stood up in church and said he did not believe that. Waters could not cover our mountains, he laughed. He walked away, others left with him. If Sanglien could read Bible, he would know. So much learning will take years, Pa. And million rupees. It is your path to horizon. Get out, get out! Go to Prime Minister. Deli? He will help you. Prime Minister not see me. He owns our country now. Tell him, Hmar people good citizens. Pa. You have to be big, important. God will help you. I will pray on mountain. I am here to see Prime Minister. Your pass, please. I know Prime Minister is in residence. Your pass. I must see Prime Minister. As citizen of India it is my right. Your pass. I am from hills of Manipur and I am here to see Prime Minister. I applied for government scholarship at University. But I received reply I am not eligible because Hmar tribe, to which I am, is not included in national census for tribes in Northeast India. Not included in the national census? No, Sir. I don't know much about the Hmar tribe. Khasi and Naga of course you know, but not Hmar. Many Hmar villages, Sir. How many of you are there? Oh, well then how would you know, you haven't been counted. Pardon, Sir. Hmar tribe and neighboring tribes inhabit territory 4,000 square miles. 4,000 square mile territory, no government school. 4,000 square mile territory, no post office. Oh, dear. Do me a favor. Write down all of this information on a piece of paper before you leave. I promise you I shall read it. Thank you, Sir. I say, look here. You're a bright chap. We need to educate bright young men like you. We need them for government posts in the tribal areas. I shall see to it that you get your scholarship. Yeah!! [Indian commentary] [Hmar tribe singing] Stop there! Is this your doing? Yes! Rochunga Pudaite. Are you Indian? From state of Manipur, in Northeast. This piece of paper will tell you how you can have eternal life. White missionary dumb. I never met a missionary. I have always been follower of Christ. You lie. All Indian Christians are converts. We got rid of Jesus Christ when we got rid of the British. You think because you are a jungle boy, you should have special privileges? I came here to study. I cannot afford to be angry with you. This is for you sister. Oh, sister. University of Allahabad. Dear Mandi, Thank you for answering with warm friendship letter in English, I write to you at St. Mary's college in Shillong. It pleases me that young Hmar lady is seeking higher education, as I am also. At University of Allahabad I must study hard to pass examinations, but I am thankful to God for opportunity. Dear Friend Rochunga, Please do not think my letters are only schoolgirl way to practice English writing. There is one person I write to and pray for always and it is Rochunga. If it pleases you, continue to write English letters to me as you have for past one year. And it will please me to continue to answer. I want to say thank you to Philosophy. [Debate group applauding] I want to thank them for permitting me part in debate. From fellow students tonight, I learn many beautiful things. A beautiful philosophy. Of wise and beautiful sayings. Of strong and beautiful teachings of Koran. So, I want to say thank you. But I do not feel that fellow students want to say thank you to me for beautiful teaching of Jesus in Bible. My tribe is mostly Christian, two generations, with no help from white missionaries. Former times in my tribe, we cut heads off our enemies. Now we pray for our enemies. Former times in my tribes, we make slaves of weakling. Now we help make weaklings strong. Suicide, in former times in my tribe - many, many. But now hardly ever. Changes did not come from white imperialists. Changes did not come from whips and guns. But from a book. [dinner conversations] [Indian language] I was a student once, so I know what it feels like to crave a good meal. You didn't know that about me did you? Tonight my dear Rochunga, my dear, dear friend, you are my guest. No more sitting in stores with those dirty little tabas or those walking tribes, "Buy me a cigarette, buy me a cigarette!" Buy me brab. We made good money together. Look there's a job I can offer you. House, car, percentage of profits. Well? Does that please you? My business enterprise is growing by leaps and bounds. Can we be partners, again? I am offered scholarship for study in Scotland. Scotland! Do you want to be a student all your life? I want to accept. I can learn Greek language, Hebrew language... Greek language, Hebrew language, you can study in your spare time! Together we could become rich, Rochunga! Do I at least tempt you? Yes. Well, what do you say? Sorry I do not say what Rochunga do. God say. How can anyone trust God? I mean, He's so infinite! [ Music ] Dear Mam/ii. In Scotland, I study very hard Hebrew language and Greek language, so my tongue aches from making so many strange sounds. All my fellow students have white faces, so at first, I cannot tell one from another. A letter to your father I have written, Mawii, asking for you in marriage, according to customs of our tribe. I pray you will speak for me to your father and that your family will begin negotiations. How different my life would be if you were here. I never know like this cold weather. And in whole world how small we are, our tribe. It is a lonely road of study that the Lord has found for me, and each new door that opens seems to take me further from you. [Engine sounds] [City noises] Dear Mam/ii. Now two oceans stand between us. How can I explain big city, Chicago? On street, walk in sea of faces but no smiles when I pass. Still, Jesus knows Rochunga in great far away country. That is magnificent secret. Dr. Bob Pierce has kept promise to sponsor my studies at small college near Chicago city. Only God's miracle could bring me so far. I live in lady's house near school. Mrs. Bartlett. Sometimes work to pay for my room. In USA, they have machines for everything. All money says, "In God We Trust". I trust too, but never have enough this money. [ Piano music ] And now, both hands together. [ Piano music ] Very good! [ Music ] Hey nigger, where's the fire? This ain't peace work. [ Music ] Sorry to disturb your rest, this session is History. [Bell rings] [student chatter] You're not keeping pace with the class, Mr. Pudaite. It is a policy at this school to encourage foreign students, but I cannot lower my standards. Not even for you. I am most regretful, Sir. New Testament theology can be quite demanding. Perhaps you should rethink your program. No, Sir. I must have every possible knowledge for my translation work. Your what? Hmar people, have own language for centuries. But only spoken, never written. The Lord's goodness allowed me to make grammar to help our people. Grammar? Yes, I found sounds of English alphabet work very well, with minor variations. Our ah, became you're a, b stays b, and cho, c. This discovery allowed me to spell almost everything we say with English alphabet. Now, I am struggling through letters from the apostle Paul. My head aches with so many shades of meaning. You are presuming to translate the subtle doctrines of the word of God for a primitive people? Are you working from the Greek? Yes, Sir. This book is the only one that can lead my people into Heaven. They must know who they are, what they can be and where they will go. Rochunga, what is your denominational background? I'm afraid I have only Jesus. Simplicity has its strengths. [ Music ] [ Piano music ] [door opening and closing] [ Piano music ] Sorry dear, let's start again. [ Music ] Come on, Rhonda. Rhonda. [Knock on door] RD? Yes. R0, can I come in for a second? Working, Charlie. Hey, come on Ro. Sunday afternoon here. Come on. You need to relax. How long are you going to keep up this grind anyway? God's work, Charlie. Ah, come here, come here. Now look out there. See there's a whole big world outside this school and your job and this room. It's beautiful, Ro. I got you a date. A date? Charlie, I'm indeed grateful to meet your friend here. He's the cutest thing. Ya'll know that? Ya'll sure don't talk much. Charlie. One moment, private. What's the matter? Excuse please. One moment, just. Rhonda. What's the matter, Ro? Charlie, English very difficult language. I studied hard. In Churachandpur little boy, I study English. In Allahabad University, I studied English. In the British Island, I study English. In America, I study English. Charlie, what language is she speaking? I don't understand her, one word! What are you boys doing anyway? Talking dirty? [Elephants trumpeting] Dear Mam/ii. Final books of New Testament stand open on my desk. Three years translating is nearing end. Great joy should be mine. But days come when upstairs room cannot hold me. [Tiger roaring] I dream of Manipur Hills and long for mist of our mountains to push against my face. Most deeply, I dream of the one who understands my heart. [Type writer machine sounds] Excuse me. I am Rochunga Pudaite. I was told I was wanted in this office. Yes. Mr. Pudaite. This is addressed to the President but he feels it's for you. Thank you. Dear Sir, At a recent missions conference in Toronto, I heard that Doctor Bob Pierce is sponsoring a student from Northeast India in the United States. Inquires have led me to believe that such a student may be on your campus. Some years back, I lived and worked in the tribal areas of India. If such a student is indeed on your campus, I would be most appreciative of a name and address. Sincerely Yours, Watkin Roberts! Mrs. Bartlett, Mrs. Bartlett! Mrs. Bartlett!! Oh my goodness. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. Revelation 22:21 Did you finish? Praise the Lord. [ Music ] For British and Foreign Bible Society, London, England. Thank you. How long will journey take please? That'll ship two or three weeks. By air, it depends on the load. Maybe four or five days. Air will be superior then. Kinda hefty. That'll be, uh, $27.80. Ship might be better way. That'll be $8.25. What'd ya do, rob a pinball machine? You want to register and insure the contents? Yes! Well you have to state the value. Three years work. OK. Minimum insurance Will be $4.75. God will be insurance. Could you tell me please, how many days journey to Toronto, Canada? We got London, here! Oh, manuscript goes to London yes, but now could you please send me to Toronto, Canada. 179 South... [Train horn] [ Music ] Tell me Mr. Youngman's story, Pa. Just stood tall and pale beside us. But he not treat Hmars like other men from outside world. Told us God not white. Told us spirit of God sees into our hearts. In eyes, there was strange searching. [Keys rattling] Excuse me. I am seeking Mr. Watkin Roberts. Yes, I am Roberts. Who are you? I am Rochunga, son of Chawnga, from the Hills of Manipur. Who? Chawnga's son. You... Here, Sir. Thank you. Now. Milk? Sugar? Thank you. Surely one of us could think of something to say. Don't you agree? When I was a boy you were a giant that once walked our hills. Every leaf in the forest trembled with your name. And when I was older you were a dream that would not go away. The Lord has given me this moment to go back. I see you Rochunga. And I see your father. Why did you leave India? Your work had just begun. Too many rules were being bent by my presence. Living under the same roof with the tribals got me into a muddle with the other missionaries. I was expelled. You could go back now. The independence of India brought us religious freedom. No one could keep you away! The Hills of Manipur demand strong legs, Rochunga. Mine seldom obey me, anymore. Going old. Then we would carry you, Mr. Youngman, with honor from village to village. There are more than 100 churches in our mountains. So many? And your early converts, are now our elders and leaders. There is Tisena. Who? Tisena... Yes, he traveled with me. Was my guide. And Talrema. Oh, I had a student named Talrema. He writes our music. The hymns we sing today. Your own hymns? Can you let me hear something, just a line? Well... Pielral nisa ka Iungrila a hung var ta. The light of eternity is shown in my heart. l ta ka ni min nghil tir naw ka Lal Isu Don't let me forget that I belong to you, Dear Lord. I ringna in min ring tir Ia Let me live your life in me. Please try to understand my difficulty, Rochunga. I went back to my trade, a chemist, perhaps 40 years ago now. I've always questioned. What an amazing Christ! He never seeks for our approval. Only for faith to believe that He is at work. All is mystery. To put ones life in His hands is not to be led astray. I was allowed to carry the seed. And you Rochunga, young man, you are the first fruits of the harvest. My father prays everyday on God's mountain. Chawnga is a clear running stream. He is also a rock that will not move. My father has kept my brain from sleeping. How can I help? Our debt to you is so great already. Please, you must allow me to help. Do you know where I could wash dishes in this country? Train tickets are very expensive. [ Music ] Dear Rochunga, My brother has received your communication and spoken on behalf of you to my father, who is pleased to be agreeable. Praying God's blessing on your long journey home to India. And waiting... [ Music ] [Hmar tribal song] [Rochunga and Students reciting books of the Bible] Government house, office of Prime Minister. Dear Rochunga Pudaite, the Prime Minister will be pleased to grant you an appointment on Tuesday next at three o'clock, to discuss you qualifications for a government post to the tribal areas. It is an honor for all our people. I promise you Pa; a way has been opened for me to climb to the top. Is the top where you want to be? This can be my platform to witness. The Hmars need someone to speak for them. Our villages have no running water and electricity, no hospitals. I have given you what you want. Now why can't I have what I want? I have always shown you my heart. There is road where God is leading, but there are many other roads. Pa, I have to use all this learning for something. I have always prayed God would keep a great horizon open to you. We have to be careful about appointing officers anywhere, but even more so when appointing them to the tribal areas. Now you, as a tribal person, should eminently qualify. I will forward your application to the man in charge of tribal affairs. He will then grant you an interview. But you realize of course, that the final decision will be his. I am anxious that our tribal peoples should advance, but I'm even more anxious that they shouldn't lose their artistry and their joy in life. Mr. Pudaite. Welcome indeed, Mr. Pudaite. I hope I am pronouncing that correctly. Yes, yes Sir. You say it isn't a family name, it means "of the clan of Pudaite". That is correct, Sir. Good, well it makes a perfectly splendid sir name. Do sit down, please. Would you care for a drink? Fruit juice? Whiskey? Fruit juice, thank you. Jeremia. I rather enjoy a whiskey in the evening. Fruit juice for the gentleman, please. Yes, it's a little chilly in the evenings at this time of year, isn't it? Well, Mr. Pudaite. You've come to me very highly recommended and that pleases me as well because we need qualified political officers in our tribal areas and with you being a tribal yourself, that's a huge advantage. Yes, the responsibilities are numerous but there are a number of rewards, as well. Pardon me, Allen, I thought I'd bring this in myself. Oh, thank you darling. This is Mr. Pudaite. My wife. This fruit juice is yours I'm sure, Mr. Pudaite. Thank you! Allen, I hope I'm not interrupting. No, of course not, sit down. Well, good health. I was just about to mention to Mr. Pudaite the benefits of the position we're discussing. Now, besides a more than adequate salary, you'll have an allowance for a bungalow, sen/ants, staff, a car and yes, a jeep. That pleases me very much. For opportunity of serving tribal people. I see that you've study abroad in Scotland and in the USA. Now that is remarkable for a tribal, isn't it? Prayers are answered. Did you read anthropology by any chance? That's my field. No, Sir. Hebrew language, Greek language. Most of time I was in America, I was day and night translating. Today, my tribe has the Bible in Hmar language. Darling, would you please? And was that the soul purpose of your translating, while in America? Yes. I translate Bible in English language, but necessary to study sources in Hebrew language and Greek language. Quite an under taking I'm sure. Allen. Thank you. Well, Mr. Pudaite. Of course I should have suspected, from the way you came here dressed tonight. But it seems that in my enthusiasm to enlist qualified personnel, I'm guilty of overlooking certain things about Mr. Pudaite. I am most certainly. Well, it comes as a great disappointment to me to discover that you are a mission native. Some ill informed, shortsighted white missionaries, have ruined you. To the Hmar tribe ever came only one white missionary. Alright, one. Well he's turned you out looking like something out of Ball Street or Sattle Row. Sir. Sir, Missionary Roberts from Wales, you've heard of him? Yes. He came to our hills before I was born. He lived with our tribe like a brother. I don't believe that. He was preparing himself to translate the Bible into Hmar language but British rogue drove him out. Yes, certainly. Guns and gospels. The British overtook this land with guns and gospels. Happily at least, the guns have been withdrawn. Allen, may I remind you that there's freedom of religion in this country. That is not the issue. If Mr. Pudaite is qualified... Ruth... Allen, if he is qualified... Ruth, please. Will you excuse us for a moment? Dr. Monforce. Allen, the man is standing there. I cannot, in all good consciousness, approve this appointment. Allen, that is unfair. I must consider what the missionaries have done to these tribals. While failing to consider what they may have done for them. [ Music ] Ro, the day will soon be gone. This is my father's mountain. He speaks with God here. And Rochunga? Words will not come. I made so many promises, Mawii. Promises I may never keep. You told me to never doubt in darkness what God has taught us in the light. Your husband has become a good student of the world. Can a mistake not often be a stepping-stone? Mawii, could you stay here for the rest of our lives? Word of God has been sown like wild grass over our hills. It pleases the Lord for me to marry a seed planter. It also pleases me. I have heard it said that a wise man will travel many miles to find a hill girl, when her beauty matches the sky. (Narrator) Rochunga and Mawii Pudaite have founded more than 80 schools, a medical clinic and a vocational training center for the peoples in of Northeast India. Today, 85% of the Hmar people can read and write. Since 1972, with the help of many, the Pudaites have mailed millions of Bibles to all names listed in the telephone books of the major cities of India and to such other countries as Pakistan, Burma, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Fienia, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan and Hang Kong. The list has no end. The seed planting goes on.
