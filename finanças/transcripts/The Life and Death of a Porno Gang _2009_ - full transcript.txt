Monday, March 5, 2001. Hi. I am Marko. I'm 30 years old, and four years ago, I graduated Film Directing at the Film Academy. I am trying to make my first feature film. Trust me, it's not an easy task. Until recently, I lived with my parents. Now, I live alone. I don't really miss all those dinners with their friends. Actually, with my ex-girlfriend's mom and dad. My mom doesn't work at all since my dad works. My sister has sugar daddies and she's doing great. My father has a company that sells air conditioners. It never occurred to him to invest some of his megabucks into my movie. But he introduced me to one of his school friends who's a film producer. I told you, I like your stuff. But it's too expensive. It's not profitable. Horror and fantasy don't pay back. Let me just tell you something. I think they may pay back. Everyone would go to movies to watch local mythology. People love fairy tales. We can do foreign sales as well. THE UNCHRISTENED DAYS (based on local mythology) The world is waiting for us to give them something different, something special. Back then, I was a complete moron. I carried around my well-packaged project and really believed someone would give me money for it. But the producers just wanted to have a famous actor who would deliver a few funny lines in a close-up, and that's it. At that time, I started a kind of video diary. Something like an autobiographical documentary about a young director who's trying to get his first feature. Please, turn it off and let us eat. So, how was the meeting? Bummer. Your dear friend won't give me money. They are unable to understand the artists. You are all the same. You are just so careless about money. You don't give a fuck. My ex-girlfriend perfectly fit into the picture of me and my family. We were together for six years and on the verge of marriage. What is the camera for? To film us. What do you mean? To film what? While we fuck. No way. Get away. Turn off the camera right now. Why? Fuck off! I'm tired of your childish tricks. When are you finally going to grow up? I have no idea what Tanja was doing with me or what was I doing with her. But as long as I had cash, she didn't ask too many questions. She had a weird ambition to become an actress one day. Would you finally start shooting before my back breaks? Well, you asked to be in my commercial, so suffer now. You are doing this on purpose just to torture me, asshole! For a while, I was directing commercials. I didn't have to do it since my dad was giving me enough money. But I guess I was trying to keep my foot in the business. Also, I have a masochistic streak in me. I hate marketing. I have nothing in common with it. THE LIFE AND DEATH OF A PORNO GANG But when I met Cane, my life turned upside down. Sunday, November 15, 1998. Cane is a porn director and a TV star. We met by chance in a restaurant. The main problem of our porn industry is no one takes it seriously. They are late for shooting, the girls come unshaven, no one is paying attention during a shot. I am the only one who's putting some effort into it. Dude, I drag the entire local porn industry on my back. Supposedly, I got his confidence right away. And the very next day, he tried to draw me into the business. - Did you just offer me a job? - Yeah, I did. Monday, November 16, 1998. - But let me tell you something. - Yeah? No artsy pansy stuff. It's strictly for... And you have to play by my rules. Just forget about your film school. So, what do you say? Tuesday, December 1, 1998. I thought it would be foolish to refuse the offer. I said to myself, "It's a great chance to put my documentary on the right track. " You'll come over here and kneel down. You take a look, and tell her, "Ma'am, I can't find a leak." You come over here and say: "it's not leaking there, but here." And you grab his hand and place it on your cunt. You pull out your cock... No, actually you pull out his cock and start to blow him. Then, you blow him for a while, and then... We'll figure out something. Dragan, get out from the shot! Are you crazy, dumb-ass? Action! Ma'am, everything looks fine. I can't find a leak. It's not leaking down there, but here. We're gonna fix it. Let me check your tool, boss. Pera! Pera! Who is Pera? The one who's gonna stick it in my ass. Pera! Stop! Stop! Wait! What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you out of your mind, dumb-ass? Why are you acting like an elephant in a china shop? And what about you, birdbrain? Why do you blow him so hard, like a lunatic? Do you want him to cum too fast? A NEW LIFE I didn't go back to work on my documentary until the following year. It turned out I was really never interested in it. Thursday, October 28, 1999. I used it as an excuse to start to work with Cane. So I said "fuck off" to everyone and moved to live on my own in a suburb. I became a porn director. The feeling that I was sinking deeper and deeper somehow recharged my energy. Action! And since I'm not able to shoot my own films, then what the fuck? The bombing of Belgrade April, 1999. Awesome! Come on. Go on! Sunday, September 24, 2000. But soon, I came across my first problems with Cane. "Blue Production" Owner: Cane Vojvodic Well, the problem was about the movie I shot using his money and without his knowledge. social-political porn horror The film starts with a poor farmer who decides to start a business of growing soybean. He takes a credit and buys genetically modified soybeans in Bulgaria because it's banned in Serbia. But since he bought bad seeds, he's reaping a poor harvest. Suddenly, out of the hole filled with the farmer's sperm and wrath, a strange plant begins to grow. Then, an aimless young man stops at the side of the road to take a leak. He sees the farmer's field overgrown with the plant. The plant's leaves remind him of marijuana. Soon, he tries to smoke it with his friends. The plant causes incredible hallucinations. The guy becomes the hottest pusher in town. He instantly becomes rich. People are developing an extraordinary addiction to his escapist weed. But trouble starts when some of his customers get short on supply. The lack of weed consumption causes bodily mutations and uncontrollable aggression. Now, the pusher has to fight for his life. More or less, that's the film. Unfortunately, Cane didn't show sympathy for my artistic ambitions. I just need the most basic 15-minute clips. Like the one you did with pissing. Look, it's for an Oscar. Our expatriates like simple things, not some artsy pansy stuff. They want something Serbian, the basic stuff. Listen, Cane, why don't we try stepping ahead of Serbian porn and enhancing our esthetics? You should be the first porn producer to introduce Serbian porn to Europe. Are you fucking with me? Fucking with Cane's money is a very risky business. Even more since his brother, who works with him, is a cop. You know what? You have to play it rough with artists. There were a lot of artists among the students we were beating up during the '90s. Tuesday, October 3, 2000. Here it comes. What? You're not coming back? I spent Cane's money on a bus loaded with sex. You said you'll pay me back. I need the money tomorrow. I have to shoot his movie. Yeah, but I filmed something else. You're using again? You stupid junkie! Cane will never find you in this lair. I'll be okay for a while. It belongs to your friend? Yeah, he's an artist. He gives art lessons to kids. Thursday, October 5, 2000. Friday, October 6, 2000. That's how I missed the events of October 5. I didn't give a fuck about it. The only thing I was thinking about was how to get money to pay back Cane. Monday, October 9, 2000. Hey, man! Wednesday, October 11, 2000. I'm struck! So one night, as I was aimlessly wandering around town, I went to see a play. Everyone left me! Even you, Mother, the one who breast-fed me. As well as you, Brother! No one is here to talk to me! Only this beautiful maiden whom I've never seen before. Have some water, brave soldier! Live in peace! Una! Look at her! Hi. How did I do? Was it brilliant? It was fantastic, but let's talk about it later. This is Marko. This is Una. I am Marko. So what is the film about? I still don't know. But I hope I'll find out soon. Maybe you should paint something yourself while you're here. Check the other one. It's awesome. While I was watching her play, I got an idea. It would be great to start the first porn playhouse in Belgrade. We should have pure pornography on stage in artistic plays dealing with current social and political issues. She loved the idea. Introduce yourself. I am Una Savich. I am 31 years old. I was born in Belgrade. I love Belgrade. I have a bachelor's degree in acting. I am a failed actress. I'm playing small parts in irrelevant plays. I also sent my photos and resume to the Screen Extras Guild so they can count on me as well. I wish I could make a radical change in my life. I'm not sure exactly what it should be... but... That's how Una and I got together. The very next day, we started to work on our porn playhouse, but... I don't know... I don't know if anything will come out of the idea because... It's really fucking hard to do it in Serbia. My story actually starts here. GATHERING Sunday, March 11,2001. You are a total lunatic. Look at this. Look. Great! I don't know. I just have more fun watching it. Then why do you act in porn? I realized it too late. I'll do anything for you, dude. So now you can do whatever you want? Cane, that asshole, can't give you shit anymore? No, dude, I'm making my own decisions. Okay, dude, but put in some action scenes, so I can show my fighting skills. Do it again. Okay, I'll think about it. Partigano, when is your new film coming out? Kids, I'm gonna kick your ass, motherfuckers! Did I tell you I started to work as a manicurist? The last time we had a shoot, you said you were starting a diet. Diets are crap. And I think fat girls are back in vogue. Where did you get that? I read it in a magazine. And it's obvious. Everyone's fed up with those skinny hangers. The whole style was imposed on us by faggots. Why did you do it? Because I love the camera. Darinka and Rade So, how much does it pay? I told you, we'll work for free until we make it. - And where's Rade? - Here. Rade! No! Come on! Igor, Yelena, get out! Dude, I'm in. Awesome! May I ask you something? Yeah. Could you lend us 50 DM until next month? We are in dire straits, so... You're still using heroin? Just a bit. Okay, I'll lend you the money. Johnny and Max - What? You didn't hear? - What? I have AIDS. I'm out of the business. Oh, I heard that. So what? Max also has AIDS. You'll only work with him. Max, will you play in our porn playhouse? What did Johnny say? Johnny. You have an extraordinary tool. It will give us the edge. What do you say? Would you get back in the business? The last ride. Do you hear that? I'm going to ride you. PORNO PLAYHOUSE What is my stance on pornography? I was always fascinated by destruction. Monday, April 2, 2001. The destruction of humanity. Spiritual and physical destruction. Our pornography is crude and cruel, without make-up. It's a battle between Eros and Thanatos, where Thanatos wins. Thanatos humiliates Eros. Welcome to the Porno Cabaret, the first porno playhouse of the Balkans. Join us in pushing the limits. We'll take you where you've never been before. We will fulfill your wildest dreams. The year is 2010. We are in Serbia. Serbs are having problems with the southern neighbors who are advancing toward the north. Serbs are disappearing. You can see the women on the streets are getting more and more beautiful. Everything's growing on them. Especially breasts. That's how deep inside its collective unconscious the nation is fighting the doom. Where are you going, girl? Hail to you! We are women from Planet Erotica 6. It's ruled by women. We came to Serbia to impose the rule of women. That's our cosmic mission. Watch out, Serbs. Patriarchy is outdated. Oh, is that you, Ognjen? I almost banged you. I knew you were a faggot. Me, a faggot? What about your new style? Listen, friend, we are in deep shit. I have to tell you something. Look at those two motherfuckers. Why don't you join them? Stop your bullshit and listen to me. I think aliens are attacking our planet. They are females. And you dressed up under their influence? Stop playing the fool. I dressed up like this to dodge a draft. You're disabled. Why should you give a shit? Anyhow, I went undercover to an alien meeting. How are women going to rule? Look around you! There are more and more faggots. They are not hiding anymore. They are taking all the major positions everywhere. Let's go, perverts! It's over! Get the fuck out of here! Why are you looking at me? Get out! Sit down. I think you owe me some money, don't you? Hey, Cane, I'll pay you back out of my first profit. Sorry, it got out of my hands. I'll pay you back in a week, okay? That's too long. And you are a bit late. I'll pay the interest, no problem. No. No way. I need some stronger insurance. Somehow, we have to seal the deal. What kind of a seal? Some kind of a seal, something like this... Assholes. I'll break your fucking necks, motherfuckers. Really? Then come closer. Get down! You stole my actors as well? I'll fuck you, motherfucker, if they don't come back. I'll fuck you, motherfucker, if my business fails. Do you hear me? Go, laugh. Let me hear you laughing. Laugh, YOU PUSSY. A SERBIAN TOUR Sunday, April 22, 2001. Thanks. Hey, give me back my beer. We left Belgrade. We won't perform there for a while. Cane and his cop brother are psychopaths. They will do anything to screw our lives. Stop! Is this his editing room? Yeah. We decided to tour around Serbia. We'll go to villages. It'll be interesting to see farmers' reactions to our sexual provocations. Sexual education for Serbs. Widening the horizons. That's our guerrilla mission. PORNO GANG "The show of the first Serbian Porno Cabaret got interrupted. The tickets were handed out to minors. The show was not registered as a porno." Blah, blah, blah. Idiots. Did you notice how many left the show? Yes, I did. They didn't understand anything. Fuck Belgrade! Who gives a shit about them. Fuck, look at that ass. It's shining like a sun. Wednesday, April 25, 2001. - Pass me that. Great. - Watch out. Lift it up. Hey, be careful. - Should I take it out and...? - Feel free to take it out. Thank you, cocksucker! Can I get a ticket for the Porno Gang? It's some heavy fucking. 50 dinars. Welcome to The Traveling Porno Cabaret, the first porno playhouse in the Balkans. Join us in pushing the limits. We'll take you where you've never been before. DON'T TREAD MY FIELD Fuck this soil. You frigid bitch. You gave me a poor harvest this year. You frigid bitch. You're home late! Did you visit your whore again? You foolish wife, I'll bleed to death! I was waiting for you to fuck me, and look at you! Did you forget your cock back at her place? To the Cabaret! Give me your plate. Put it down. Great. Bravo! Why did you start going down this road? I wanted to change my life. Down to the core. Just as you said. And what about you? Isn't it better to be a centerfold than to drag your ass down the muddy Serbian roads? The mud is better, trust me. I'll keep doing this just for a while. Then I'll stop. Let's hope Marko's plan works out and I end my career at the top. This is not my kind of thing. I want to have a home, a wife, and kids. To become head of a household, just like my father. God bless his soul. What will I tell my future wife that I did in my life? The girls avoid my type of guy. They find us slimy. No, it's not true. I find you sweet. - Hi, I'm Ceca. - Hi, Ceca. - Am I interrupting anything? - No, not at all. I just stopped by to tell you I watched your show tonight. It's great. Keep up the good work. Thank you. Are you a tranny, Ceca? Yeah, but I don't like to be called that. I am Ceca. Mostly at night, and during the day, I am Mirko. I live here in this village. Are you as beautiful during the day as you are at night? Johnny, let's go to sleep. We have to work tomorrow. Wait, it's not that late. Right now, Nikola! You will get drunk, and tomorrow you'll be a good-for-nothing. Chill out. Chill out? I'm going away. - Go. - Faggot Marko... who is this man? Hello. Good evening. I am Franz. I watched your show, it's great. I've never seen anything like that before. I'm from Berlin. I've been traveling around the Balkans since 1991. It's a great place. An amazing mixture of brutality and creativity. I am following your work. You show that kind of stuff in your plays, don't you? Yeah, kind of. Your plays are very daring. Of course, you can always go one step further. I'm always for going one step further. Then we should talk. I have a place not far away from here. May I offer you a drink? Right now? Yeah, I have a car. Ok. I came here in 1991 as a war correspondent for Die Welt. I had an advantage because I knew the language. I grew up in Yugoslavia. My parents worked at the embassy. I got into all war zones, in Kosovo as well, following different armies in the first line of fire. It's a great experience. You like extreme situations? Yes. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't like your stuff. You and I, we are much alike. You are also in the front line of fire. In arts, but that's what it is. It all started in 1993, in Bosnia. I was following mujahedins who were arriving at the camps. I went into battles after them. I was regularly sending my texts to Berlin. Suddenly, I was approached by a person from New York who read my articles. He asked me to film my adventures. That's how I learned about a secret market for films with war horror scenes. The buyers are wealthy and the prices are extremely high. I was up to my neck in work. As you know, those wars were very cruel. And what are you doing now? There's still some work, but much less than during the wartime. And back then it was much safer. In war, you're able to do whatever you want. But we are still finding some footage. The Balkans are still convenient for that stuff. A lawless region. You see, I fell in love with the Balkans. But you can't live on love. You may say I'm producing films of a specific genre. Those are... You probably heard about snuff movies. Young man, what would you say if I asked you to do films for me? You can make snuff plays and film them at the same time. There's still pornography, but it's mixed with violence. You can have plots and politics, since you're good at that. Let's be clear, you expect me to kill people in front of camera? You're probably concerned about how to find actors for those films. Wouldn't it be better if they approach you on their own? They should be the ones who don't care about their lives anymore, who would like to cut it off. And you and your troupe would not be the only ones enjoying the money I'll get you. The victims will also get a chance to take care of their loved ones in a substantial way. No, Franz, please don't. I'm not the right one for this. I insist. Take the money, no strings attached. But just think it through. Any real artist should explore uncharted territories. If you accept it, you will become the first snuff artist. Monday, April 30, 2001. You frigid bitch. You gave me another poor harvest. You frigid bitch. You gave me another poor harvest. You frigid bitch. You gave me another poor harvest. Hello. We're from the Town Hall. We'd like to have a word with you. Yes, please. We have to deny you our hospitality. Why? We are a decent village. We don't want our kids to sneak out at night and watch your rubbish. And who are you? Me? I am Milan Radulovich, the mayor of this town. Please, pack up and go. - What did they want? - Nothing. It's bullshit. - Should I fuck them up? - It's okay. Should I hit the road? - What are you doing here? - Well... Who punched you? My dad. Forget it. What time is the show tonight? There won't be any show. We're leaving this place. - Why? - We have to. I came to ask if you can come with us. Just out of the blue? But you said you would love to do some acting. What keeps you here? Rada, I have to go. Dad will kill you anyhow when he finds out that I left. Rada, don't be afraid. We'll see each other. Now we're screwed. - Where is that motherfucker? - They'll kick the shit out of us. There he is. Who's the other one? Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Hurry up! Hurry up! Let's go! Drive! Drive! Get inside! Hurry up! - He has a gun! - Drive! Drive! - Shut the door! Shut it! - Hurry up, Marko, get inside! Awesome! Sunday, May 6, 2001. Tomorrow, we're getting out of here. We didn't have a lot of luck at this place. Yeah. It didn't turn out the way we expected. Speak for yourself. I'm not complaining. We didn't even make enough money for food. It doesn't make sense. Plus, Johnny and I need medicine. We quit therapy. Yeah, business is not going so well. The business is not going at all. Yeah, and we had such a great time with Cane? You couldn't even buy cigarettes and he treated us like animals. I didn't make any promises. I said we should start out and see... Whoever doesn't like it should go back to Belgrade. My life story. I grew up in a remote village. Friday, May 11, 2001. In winter, you get stuck. And not only in winter. My first sexual experience was with a sheep. I named her after my favorite singer, Blondie. Come to grandpa to get your ass fucked. Get her, boss! He got excited! The motherfucker will have a stroke! Then they slaughtered Blondie. I hated my father because of that. I cried for days. Although it happened long ago, sometimes I see Blondie in my dreams. Slut! Tuesday, May 15, 2001. We asked about you. You were doing the same kind of shit in Belgrade. So now, you moved here to shit on our doorstep. You are a young man. You should do creative stuff in your life instead of this, you Belgrade shit. Hey, Chubby, did you pee-pee? Yeah. Do you have a boyfriend, Chubby? My name is Sofija and I don't have a boyfriend. Why is an attractive little girl like you without a boyfriend? What do you say? Did you ever touch anything like this in your life? It's too small. I don't touch the small ones. What's up? Are we going to make some cracklings? You dirty motherfuckers! Fuck you! Come on! Come on, pussies! Okay, I'll let you go. But you have to leave my county at once. Is that clear? Yeah, of course. Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Get back! Where are you trying to go? Did they steal all our money? Yeah. I'll fuck the motherfuckers when I get them. We'll starve to death. Where are we going to find food? I can't stand it anymore. Stop the bullshit! Hey, we'll hunt something. Did I pick a wrong time to visit? How did you find us here? I can find whatever I want. Did you think about my proposal? Yeah. And...? How did you know I won't report you? Even if you did, I would still be here in front of you. But what do you say about the proposal? - I'm in. - Great. But I have to talk to the others. I'm glad to work with you. If they accept it, then we'll work together. - I don't know. Do whatever you want. - I think it's a terrible idea. I don't like it, either. Marko, brother, do we have to do it? The money is good. More than good. And you two? We'll go along with it. Of course, I'm staying. Me, too. I just don't want to kill any animals. If those films happen at all, all the actors will be volunteers. The ones who already chose to end it anyhow. And if we agree on everything, Franz will send us the first one. There's nothing to be scared of. Make your own judgment. Whoever wants to stay should stay, and the others may go to Belgrade right now. You'll get paid. I got some startup money from Franz. Wednesday, June 6, 2001. Everything seems so unbelievable. And terrifying. What if someone really accepts? You and I decided to go all the way to the end, even before we met. We're anxious to look at the face of horror. We'll shoot a couple of films. We'll take the money. I'll ask for a lot of money. He's rich, I saw it. Then we can return to Belgrade and do the right stuff. Where are you from? From the next village. I want to see what it looks like. I love films. You know you'll have to go all the way to the end? I mean, it's going to hurt you. Did Franz tell you about the money for your folks? I only have a mom. I don't want to give a penny to that slut. Go! No one left the troupe. It was hard in the beginning. We almost didn't talk to each other. But after the shock wore off, we got back to our previous life. The plays were still our main business. A chance for snuff rarely appeared. When I started this film... I didn't have the slightest idea how far it would take me. Thursday, June 28, 2001. How much does it cost? Hoffman is 25 DM. A half a gram of smack is 10 DM. A gram is 15 DM. Cocaine is 150 DM, but it's pure. One E is 10 DM, 5 pills are 40 DM. Wow, you pumped up the prices. Why are you complaining, guys? At least you have some money now. Okay, give it to me. Come on, Rade, don't get my whole crew high. What are you talking about? It'll just make them better. This one will get us stoned. This thing between us, it's not going to work. Why? I'm sick. Well, I didn't plan to live forever. What were you doing in the woods? Picking mushrooms. Is that what it's called? Why the fuck do you care what we were doing? Give me a break. What were you filming? I was just filming nature. A dirty hermaphrodite! Hey, are you crazy? Stop it, chill out! I'll fuck you, motherfucker! He)', guys, stop it! Whore! Ceca, don't do it. Ceca, don't. What are you doing, asshole? Try the pastry. A mushroom special. You gathered some great mushrooms, dude. I had a hard time before we talked. Me, too. I hope you trust me now. We'll never be apart again. Not even for a second. No, we won't. Latif Aga is traveling down the road We are seduced by acid Sunday, September 2, 2001. Look how sweet they are. Yeah. I would love to have kids. What about you? No. You're so clueless. My name is Stevan Savich. I was born in 1968, in Kragujevac. When I was 3 years old we moved to France. We, the Serbs in France, were able to listen and watch Serbian news and under their influence, I decided to come back to Serbia. And I went to the Croatian battlefield. Right when I got there I was drilled to become a sniper shooter. I got a nickname, Terrier, because I was able to lie motionless for 48 hours and wait for a victim. I was pissing and shitting inside my underwear. I remember one scene from the beginning of the war in Croatia. We walked into a courtyard. There was an iron bed in the yard and a naked girl was stretched on it. She had already been raped. Her head was cutoff... and put on a tray next to the bed. After the wars, I moved to this village where I live with a wife and two daughters, lvana and Sanja. I'm dying of liver cancer. I got it as a consequence of having AIDS first. And I got AIDS on the battlefield from a needle. You asked me if I feel remorse. I killed... civilians... I killed soldiers... I killed women and children. I'm feeling remorse. I'm feeling remorse. At least the money for this film will help them to get out of deep poverty. It will be the only good thing their father ever did for them. Action! Hello, soldier! You seem lonely. Hello, beautiful. What's worrying you? I'm too far away from home. I haven't seen my wife and kids for three years. I can help you and distract your thoughts away from them. I am talented at healing soldiers. Can you help me forget war? Of course. I am the mistress of the night. I'm almighty at night. Hit me. Hit me! You motherfucking fat bitch, hit me! Stop! Sofija! Sofija! Sofija, where are you? Sofija! Sofija! What happened? I can't find Sofija. Come on, she just went out to pee. Why are you freaking out? Sofija! Where are you? Sofija! Sofija! Sofija! Sofija, are you okay? We've been looking for you for hours. I just went out for a walk. It's such a beautiful morning. Tuesday, September 4, 2001. Hello, I am Strahinja Pantich from the Department of Blood and Sexual Offenses. Hello, Mr. Strahinja, I was expecting you. We found him this morning. It's probably some sect. It's not a sect. They're just a bunch of perverts. Guys, let's get out of here. We got enough money. Let's go while we still have heads on our shoulders, guys. Johnny, please let's go home! Please, please, let's go home! Marko, please, let's go home! Wednesday, September 5, 2001. Igor, honey, it's Mom. Are you guys doing okay? Dad and I are coming back home soon. We promise. Yes, honey, we will. Stop crying, honey. Igor, don't, honey. I was born here. Are you going to say hello to them? No. I am very happy with the footage. I love the confession before his death. It's an excellent idea. We should use it again. How did the crew react to the whole thing? Excellent. Excellent. I am glad because I have a great idea. Some of my customers from Europe and America would be interested in watching one of your snuff shows live. We should just set up a time and place and I'll bring them over. Five or six of them, not more. Of course, they would be paying much more. SNUFF # 3 LAPOT Friday, September 7, 2001. Make me forget that death is all around us. God bless you. Grandpa came for a visit. I brought you some food and refreshments. Dragane, is that you? Dragane? It's me, Grandpa. It's me. What are you doing here? Didn't you watch us last night? Yes, I did. And I was thinking all the time how that guy has the same voice as our Dragan. Milojko is the only cool character from my village. Let's go. There's that guy, Komnenko. He's harassing the entire village. Everyone is afraid of him. He's such a slimy piece of shit. He went to prison three times. Twice for rape and once for murder. But they released him right away due to lack of evidence. People are running away from him. He gets drunk and then he harasses anyone. A few days ago, he tried to rape Milanko's daughter. That's him. Can we start it all over again? No way. Hey, let's do it again. I will get you cut-rate drugs, just let's do it again. Marko, can we do it? No. Action! Timber! Stop! Stop! Stop! Awesome! Awesome! Go there quickly and do a close up of his head. Hurry up! Police! Inspector Pantich speaking! Put down your arms and lie on the ground. Strahinja, motherfucker. I repeat, put down your arms and lie on the ground. Stop! Stop now! Come on, get inside! Get inside! Tuesday, September 11, 2001. It's great. It's really great. You must eat something. You can't go on like this. Are you a believer? I don't know. I think I don't believe. You think? When I'm trying to grasp what I believe in... it looks to me like it's my own image, but somehow magnified. St. Nikola is a protector of travelers. Thank you. Take care, son. And remember, you will never ever be alone. I'm staying. Why? I had a dream. What do you mean you're staying? What did you dream about? So, your action career is over. Yeah. It's your fault. Brother. Good luck to all of you. Same to you. Sunday, September 23, 2001. Marko! Marko, come out! Wednesday, November 28, 2001. It's useless. It won't start up. I don't know what's wrong. We have to go to a mechanic. Tomorrow, we'll take you to a doctor. It's too risky. They'll catch us. You have to see a doctor. Look at you, you look like... What? Shit. Hey, this is going to help you for sure. No reason to be scared. Give me your little hand. Now, let me find your little vein. Thank you. Monday, November 30, 2001. I am Krsta Novakovich, a farmer from this village. And this is my family. My son, Milan. My wife. My daughter-in-law. And this is my granddaughter, Slavica. Doctors say she hasn't got much time left. She's deaf and almost completely blind. We tried to cure her in every possible way. Neither herbs nor women healers helped. I also went to Ostrog Monastery. Nothing helps. People say it's a consequence of the bombing, of so-called "uranium" that was dropped around here. The land, all the way down to the river, is polluted. And she usually played there. That's also why those cows started to glow. This is a calf from my favorite cow, Belka. She died a month ago. It's born like that. I didn't want to kill it. I felt sorry for it. I loved my cow Belka very much. The money I'm going to get for this film we'll use to cure Slavica. There's a doctor in Russia who says it's curable. So we'll give it a try. If God helps us... Help us, God, and God's Saints. You don't love me any more? It doesn't have anything to do with it. I'm not in the mood for sex. You are not going to kill this farmer. Why? We need money. He also needs money. You will give him money, but you won't kill him. Not him, he's different. Different? He didn't hurt anyone. Oh, yeah? And are you God to judge who's guilty and who's not? And what should I say to Franz? Fuck Franz! Una, he's a nasty motherfucker. He can screw us just like that. Also don't forget about our future gigs. Don't you see what's happening to us? Don't you see where we are going? We have to stop this. What's wrong about that, Una? Death and sex are a perfect combination. They are bound together, just like the two of us. You're an impotent loser. Saturday, December 1, 2001. You have to go. You are busted! Fuck! Motherfuckers! What a terrible timing! Can we just finish it? We're almost done. No. This is your last chance to escape. Okay, then, let's go. What the hell are you doing? Why don't you finish it? Shut up, old man! It's your lucky day. Marko, we would like to tell you something. We are getting out of the business. We're going back to Belgrade. Why? We can't do it anymore. We went on this trip to fuck and not to kill. Okay. We're going to sleep in this motel. - Okay. - Fine. Una left us. How can she do this to us? Dumb fucking bitch! Don't call her names. Okay. Couldn't you do anything about it? We'll stay in touch. I hope you're not planning to fuck things up. Are you warning me? No, I'm just asking. And saying it would be a foolish thing to do. I have my people everywhere. You wouldn't believe some of the places they're at. I'm glad to know it now. Be smart, kid. I believe in you. RETURN Monday, March 11, 2002. POLICE ON TRAIL OF PORNO GANG! Tuesday, May 9, 2002. Vanja? Okay, I'll see you in an hour. Sofija was driving. Seems like she was drunk. The car fell off a cliff, and they all died on the spot. I was supposed to go with them, but I got sick, so I stayed. When is the funeral? Tomorrow. Now it's just you and me. What about Una? She dropped out of the game. Hi, Vanja, it's Marko. What's up? No, I didn't find her. Listen, I'm getting the money from Franz soon, so I'll bring it to you. Yes. Vanja, that's not the reason I called you. I heard you were working with Cane again. Yes. Well, you know what? Now that I have his money, I'd like to pay him back. Yes. Hopefully, it'll get his brother off my back. Don't tell him I'll stop by, or he may set a trap for me. Where are you, dude? Marko? Why don't you ask me to come in? Come in, come in. Hi, Inspector. I'll cut his throat. Vanja. Vanja, I'm sorry. No, it's okay. I finally killed someone, too. Friday, June 5, 2002. What kind of shit is going on? I have to ask for a break, please. Who do you think you are? You're not a star to screw us like this. I see you're doing fine. Is that a leading role? Let's get out of here. That's the reason I came here. Where are we going to go? We're going back. THE LAST SNUFF Oh, love birds, you got together again, huh? Hey, I really loved the calf with six legs. I have a new idea. We should film freaks around Serbia, both humans and animals. I'm sure we can find an audience to jerk off to that as well. It can be done simultaneously with snuff. But let me get to the main point. I was able to get a group of gentlemen for the show again. This time, we'll go to a secured shelter. They won't be able to find us. Where's the money? Here it is. You seem a bit nervous? Yeah, a bit. Get your people together right now. I scheduled the show for next week. We're getting out of the business. We'll send the money to Rade and Darinka's kids. And now I'm going to take you to a romantic place. A honeymoon? Something like that. This used to be a Roman sanctuary. I was planning to shoot my film here one day. I feel like I've wasted my life. I wish I could be born again. I feel cold. You and I, we are eternal voyagers.
