[tense music] [mechanism clicking] [music box tinkling] [mechanism whooshing] [music box tinkling] [mechanism whirring] [gulls squawking in distance] [music box tinkling] [lid slamming] [Eerie Voice] Chickadee. Chickadee. Chickadee. [birds chirping] [music box tinkling] [person screaming] [body thudding] [bright music] I never would think I'd ask you to do something dangerous or immoral, or blasphemous. Sorry. I may not have known you very long, Cath, but I wouldn't have reckoned you the type to make such a fuss about nothing. We'll get off at the next stop then, shall we? Go home instead. No, no, I'm all right, honestly Lillian. There's really nothing to be frightened of, you see. [bus hissing] Good morning George, you're looking very well. Oh, he's on time for a change then. Merry Christmas. [Driver] Merry Christmas. Oh, good heavens, the man's incorrigible. Thinks he's Errol flipping Flynn. [door hissing] Introduce me, then. [cows mooing] [Fergus] I was just asking myself if there's a cow in all creation as dozy as that one and here you are. Ha bloody ha. Look at that stand foot. Nine, same. So, the front room's seven foot six, Claire. What are you gonna do, cut its head off or its feet? [cow mooing] Oh dear. What? She looks ready to meet her maker. Hell fire, not again. -No! -Whoah! Too late. Ah, shit! Yup, great big lake of it. You know what this means, don't ya? Yes, another lovely day washing cow parts out of your clothes. Worse. I have to fetch that cow out of the slurry, you're gonna have to go and fetch my mother. Oh. [laughing] Bad luck. [Claire] Stupid cow. This is the second time this week. Hang on there, Daisy, I'll have you out. [baby crying] [Claire] Coming, Rosie. [music box tinkling] [Woman] We'll just give the others the usual five more minutes, shall we? [bus revving] Excited? I am. Oh, you. [light eerie music] Don't mind her, nose ache. Stop being polite, George. When did being polite get you anywhere? Ridiculous man. Lillian, I'm not sure. Impressive woman, Mrs. Moon, got a real gift. You're in safe hands. [door knocking] [Violet] My dears. Hello, Violet. [George] Good morning. [eerie music] [woman screaming] Light the candles, Lillian dear. [match hissing] Oh, George. We always feel your dear wife's presence so strongly as the old year passes. Lillian, your dear brave brother's never far from us in this house. And our new pilgrim. [Lillian] Cath. Catherine. It's vulgar to shorten such a beautiful name. Catherine. Is there a loved one whose silent sleep you would disturb? Catherine? Well, whomsoever you seek among our friends in the spirit world, may it be a soul who sleeps in peace and tranquillity. Now join hands with me all my best beloveds and we will fare safely into the world beyond. Close eyes with me all my best beloveds and we will see what may not be seen. Meet again those who have been gathered home. Now answer me you friendly sleeping spirits. Who will wake and answer me? [wood creaking] Answer me. [Cath breathing heavily] No, no. No, not you. No, I don't want you. Go away. Go away, I'm not your chickadee! Mommy! [Eerie Voice] Chickadee. * So here it is Merry Christmas * * Everybody's having fun * * Look to the future now * * It's only just begun * [Violet] Oh, Claire. Cow crisis. I beg your pardon? Well, no point me doing rescue duties. I've never been very good with animals. No. Oh, look Rosie, it's daddy! [Rosie] Dada. So, Fergus is extracting the cow from the slurry and I'm here to extract you, so to speak. Witness have it. You needn't have got all this. Oh I know how busy you young women are with your keep fit and your self-improvement. Thank you, yes, my course is going really well. Top of the class for information technology, I am. Then how you fit it all in? Well, it's all these convenience foods I suppose. Steak and kidney pudding. Didn't win the war on lentil burgers, did we? Oh, haven't seen this before. It's lovely. Yeah, something wrong with the mechanism. I thought Fergus might take a look at it for me. Where's her little friend? I know I shouldn't have picked it up. We'll have to take it back, Cath. I wouldn't have recognised her. But her eyes. I'd know those eyes anywhere. [lightly tense piano music] [Lillian] Odd. You've met Violet before? [Cath] When I was a child. And you haven't seen her since? Not for 60 years. And you thought you didn't know anyone in Paignton. I don't know anyone anywhere. Oh. [Woman] Now come on, Ernest. Stand up straight, don't speak. [Ernest whimpering] Remain spry and sprightly at all times, -the Happy Haven rule. -See here, Donna's gonna clean that pecker well and truly up. Now come on dear, this really won't do. Hey, there's Christmas pudding soon. Oh my little oh my. Come on, moms, get your skates on. He's the same every year. Got nobody outside Happy Haven, you see? Not like you, Cath. Hmm? [Lillian] Not now. Why? Your childhood friend! I never said we were friends. [Lillian] Oh I think it's splendid news. We were sisters. [camera clicking] Oh, Cath. [music box crank clicking] [Dad] Now. Look at this. [music box tinkling] Happy Christmas, both of you. Mind you share it nicely now. [Dad] Right, everybody ready? [camera clicking] [Claire] Violet, I only said you look at bit tired. There's no need to jump down my throat. [Rosie wailing] Haven't you got a dummy or something to shut that little madam up? [Claire] She's hungry, that's all. [Violet] Girls are always trouble. Make sure you have a boy next time. [Claire] There isn't going to be a next time. Not unless we can get shot at the farm. What did you say? All right, Daisy. Nearly done. [jeep revving] Hello, mum. Like the hat. Look at you. [Fergus] Good journey? I'd love those filthy clothes in the wash for a start. [cows mooing] [gate clanking] Your dad and I had it hard you know, we worked like slaves. It's good to see you making a go of the old place. Your dad would be really proud of you. Things could actually be a bit better, mum. It's not just the BSE business, it's the prices, you wouldn't believe them. We're actually thinking of- You know, Claire's letting herself go a bit. Oh did she tell you Diana and Cole are coming for Christmas after all? Oh, I thought Diana was more a winter sun sorry girl. No, not this year. [Violet] Oh, you'd hardly credit they were sisters. [light music] Get out. So you were stepsisters. Violet was younger than me, and smaller. And prettier. My mother u... Tell me about your mother. My mother's dead. Well, yes dear. All our mother's are dead. We're old ladies. All that time. All that long time ago. No, ladies. [cups clanging] -[woman screaming] -[eerie music] Mommy! [Young Cath] Mommy! You were well away there, mum. We were just having a little talk. Oh, let me do that for you. [Donna] No, that's all right. I'm always glad to see new residents getting on well here at Happy Haven, Lillian, but I will not permit cliques. [Lillian] It's just that otherwise it's hard to hear yourself thinking here with the television on all the time. Do you have a complaint to raise? Oh, no. Because I'm sure Mr. Tarbuck will be enormously interested to hear your comments on the standard of care in his establishment. Oh, please don't trouble Mr. Tarbuck. Well, you get on and clear this mess you made. No, I'll do that for her, really. Don't stand there gawking. [everyone chuckling] [rain pattering] [fire crackling] [chimes ringing] You can't leave it like that. Why not? Ah, it looks like, it looks like she's hanged herself. [laughing] It does a bit, doesn't it? Quite funny though. Where on earth did you take that whole thing up from? Diana! [screaming] Careful! Oh, happy Christmas! Oh! -Oh, you're wet. Take it off. -Well you've seen it out there. And the traffic was appalling. Oh, you know, that must have done 30 Christmas trees and still never managed to stay up on a single one. Do you remember the year dad tried sticking a coat hanger up his bum? [laughing] Mrs. Moon! It's been ages. Happy Christmas. [Violet] You look just the same, Diana. Pretty as ever. Yep, you do, you look great, Di. What have you done with the others? [Diana] Oh, they're unloading the car. [Claire] Right. [Diana] Where's Rosie? I don't know why your mother had to pack so many clothes. It's only family. Sam? Sam? [cow mooing] Uncle Fergus? I'm not too late, am I? Hey, cowboy! [chuckling] You haven't forgotten how, have you? Come on then. [Sam] Which one? [Fergus] Here, do that one. [Sam] Where's Daisy? [Fergus] Sam brought a Ouija board. [chuckling] No thanks. [Sam] Wait, this one's ripening. [Fergus] You all right? Yes, I'm fine. Ooh. Don't hold with all that cobblers, do we Rosie? Is there anybody there? Yes. Do you have a message for anybody here? Jonna. You're pushing it. No I'm not. Then it's you, you're the one who's cheating. Look, no hands. [Sam] It's working. [humming] Anyone who thinks this is a silly game would be wise to leave the table now. There are sleepers in the world beyond who don't take kindly to being snickered at. [Jonna snickering] Jonna, grow up. Take no notice, Mrs. Moon. Now, join with me, my best beloveds. [Sam humming] Ow, ow. And we will see what may not be seen. It is moving. Shh. C. [Sam And Jonna] H. -I. -[door creaking] Oh really, no consideration. [Rosie babbling] Right, well. I'ma put Rosie to bed then. Should have been put down hours ago, poor little mite. Mum. Well. [Jonna] Night, Rosie. [All] C. K. A. D. E. E. [glass shattering] -What was it? -Chickadee. Now. Something kadee, something kadee. What does that mean, something kadee. It means your ghost can't spell. It's probably speaking in some other language. Try one more. Can we play another game? No, come on, we're going to bed. Sammy, come on, go. [eerie music] [fire whooshing and crackling] Hard to see how they can ruin a simple plate of toast and marmalade. But they do. Every day. [pills clacking] Those help, do they? I've been taking them so long now I can't tell. [Lillian] Seeing a doctor? Sort of. [door creaking] Cath. Take that dress off and wear this one. [Cath] Oh, that's ancient. Oh it's a lovely colour though. It brings out your eyes. You must have been a lovely mother. Never a mother. Never a wife. Got no family. I thought Violet said you had a brother. My brother died in the war on the Burma railway. I thought I'd lost him forever. But then Violet came to live in Paignton. And sometimes, sometimes in her house I do hear him, hear his voice. It's a comfort to know he's waiting for me. Talented woman, your sister. Stepsister. [Lillian] Got that ballerina? Oh yes, yes, she's in my treasure box. [hens clucking] [Diana] Rosie will be fine. Ooh, it's freezing! [doors thudding] [jeep starting and revving] [music box tinkling] [sombre piano music] Ow! Spiteful. [eerie music] I'll tell my mummy of you. [lightly eerie music] [door knocking] I don't like Christmas. We've got some wonderful news, Chickadee. So sweet, the way you call her that. Chickadee. [tense eerie music] You can both be bridesmaids. She's gone to her family. It is Christmas, you know. My son's coming for me in a minute. He's an accountant. Violet hasn't got any family, has she, Cath? [eerie music] No. Please, mummy. Ah! Here somewhere. That's it. Fergus Moon, that's her son. I'll write it down for you. Lower Edgecombe Farm. It's on Dartmoor. I'll give you the phone number too. Lovely girl, her daughter-in-law. Lovely baby. Oh, would you mind if Cath just sat down for a moment? If you're unwell, of course. Only my son will be here soon. Spending Christmas with my family, I am. [Young Cath] No, please, mummy. Ah! She sat on our presents, daddy. Why do you have to be so bloody clumsy? [holiday trumpet music] [tractor revving] [cows mooing] I thought you loved country life. Birdies tweeting, new calves mooing. Yeah, and pooing, pissing, treading on your feet, eating all your money. Come on, Claire. You've got the perfect life, the perfect husband. Fergus was quite a catch you know. You know, the only other woman he's ever really been interested in is his ghastly mother. I thought Rosie would cheer the old bag up a bit, you know? First grandchild and all that. She won't even look at her. Mrs. Moon likes boys. Boys will continue the line. Boys to plough till kingdom come. We're getting out, Di. [Diana] What? We're selling up if we can. Why? Do you know what I dream of? A flat in London, two window boxes, ivory coloured carpets, tube station on the corner, a little shop selling vanilla candles and antique pine. Why would you want my life? I don't. [jeep starting] -[cows mooing] -[sheep bleating] Nobody at school eats beef now, only hamburgers. [Fergus laughing] I know, I keep telling them. Should I go and do the water now? Yeah, go on, off you go. Oh, hello. Haven't you told your mum yet? Oh, give us a chance. Cheer up, only three more days of family happiness. Hmm. Can we survive it? What's this then? Oh, I thought my son could have a look at that. Jonna's very handy, aren't you darling? From Polytech Electra. New university, if you don't mind. No, I'd rather Fergus did it if it's all the same to you. Oh, Claire. I can't get over her not washing these since last year. And this icing's rock hard. Sure there's nothing I can do? Well, I can watch the telly then. No, I didn't know what I ever saw in him either. I imagine you thought he'd be clever and interesting. Mm, such a cliche isn't it? Shagging the lecturer instead of reading the books. I remember the day Fergus first brought you home from college. We weren't too sure about you, you know? We thought he'd choose a big, strong girl, an outdoor type. [chuckling] Us business daddy's girls called him the aggie boys. Hunky, but dozy. Well, at 18, the last thing any girl wants is to be a farmer's wife. And then you start to grow up and start seeing what you missed. Oh, it was all a long time ago, Mrs. Moon. Oh, call me Violet, love. [Diana] Sammy, there you are, what have you been doing? I've been feeding the cows, mum. My son, you have grown. Well, it's got to be what, three years since you saw him last. Who would have thought a city boy would turn out to be so useful on a farm, hey? Get off me. Well, don't you two make a lovely pair. Don't they, Diana? Two peas in a pod. Put the kettle on, mum. I'll do it. How old are you now, son? I'm 12 in February. I was just saying, Claire. Fergus and Sam, two peas in a pod. [light tense music] -[light piano music] -[Lillian humming] [gasping] Oh, Cath! You startled me. I haven't got anything for you. That doesn't matter, dear. Pointless waiting. Have it now. I'm not used to this, kindness like this. [gasping] Oh. Oh. [chuckling] I know all about you, you see. Creeping down to the kitchen in the night, midnight feasts. Well, now you can eat away without having to switch the light on. And don't think you're the only girl at Happy Haven hiding a guilty secret, Cath Marks. Pale cream or Amontillado? Low pressure heading our way. Stormy weather for Devon and Cornwall and with the met office issuing a severe weather warning there will be some treacherous conditions if you're out and about, damaging- Where's the gruesome twosome? Sorry? Miss Castle and Miss Marks. [Reporter] The message for Christmas day, I'm afraid. [door knocking] [Cath] Oh please don't tell anyone. Promise you will never tell! I promise. [door knocking] [Valerie] We all right in there, ladies? Coming. I'm coming in now. You missed your tea. [Lillian] Well Cath had a little headache. Well I hope she don't need the doctor, it's Christmas eve. Well actually, she's been a little bit sick but don't worry, I've cleared most of it up. You can come and see if you like. Do you mean you killed your mother? [mom panting] [tense music] Careful, Kitty. Stand back from the edge. [Mom] Let me see. How do I look? [Dad] Wonderful! [Mom laughing] [Young Cath] Come, mummy, come and look at this. Oh, oh! Ooh, little cow! All you ever do is show me up. Look! Look what you've done! Fat, stupid clumsy girl! I was always clumsy. [sobbing] Mummy always said I was clumsy. Oh. Grownups can be very cruel. Shut up, mummy! Shut up being horrible! [mom screaming] What did you do that for? You killed your mummy! You pushed her! They all blamed me. Even him. He blamed me. Your stepfather? He never spoke to me. He never looked at me. He took Violet and left. Left me on my own. Forever and ever. [sobbing] But it was an accident. [metal clattering] [light eerie music] [Claire] Watch, Di. You're not watching! This one's nice, Claire. I'm not sure it's your colour though. Oh! Oops, Claire! [Claire laughing] It's yoga. I know what it is, thank you very much. She does it to keep her fanny firm for Fergus. Diana. Well, you do. I'm going to the loo. Now, madam. 12 years ago, Fergus and Claire's wedding. What was it? Forgot your father behind the marquee? No. God, I'm not that much of a monster. It was when he came back from his stag night. We were drunk! Please, Violet, don't say anything. It was too long ago. Claire's my sister and I don't want anyone thinking I want to hurt her. Course not, lovely. Course not. [Fergus] You have to hold it higher, Jonna, do it. [Diana] So you won't say anything? All I want is the best for my Fergus. And for him to stay on the farm where he's happy. [Claire screaming] [tense music] Claire! God. Claire? [Fergus] That's it, nearly done it. Ugh! Dad, you said to stop counting! -Thank you. -No slacking down there! [Violet] Fergus, you better come quick! There's been an accident! Come on! [Jonna] Come on, Sam. All right, I don't think you've broken anything. More cushions, Sam. Let's get you comfortable. Oh, darling. There, is that better? Where does it hurt? It all hurts. What happened? Someone left Sam's Ouija board on the top stair. [Jonna] Sam. But not me. Just where someone was bound to trip over it. [rain pattering] [light pensive music] Christmas. [Lillian] George, you're taking a bit of a risk. No, it's all right. I just saw Valerie leave. For you. It's a chrysanthemum. Mmm, so I see. So you'd better come have a cup of tea. [solemn choir music] * And a manger for his bed * Come on, Lillian, change your mind. My place is lovely and warm, and quiet. I don't like to think of you stuck in here all over Christmas with all these old fogies. Oh, it's very kind of you, George. But apart from being an old fogie myself, I think I want to stay here with Cath. Something short of a scratch card, that one. Don't be rotten, George. [Donna] There you go. Thank you. [Woman] Can we have a cup of tea? [Donna] You've all had yours. Are you gonna tell me? Tell you what? What Violet did to upset your barmy friend. She's not barmy. Where is she, by the way? Lillian? [buttons clacking] [solemn choir music] [phone ringing] Ooh. Sit tight, Claire, I'll get it. Moon Towers. Is Violet Moon there? Yes she is, who's calling? Hello? Hello? [door creaking] [rain pattering] [door knocking] [Lillian] Hey, love? Perhaps she'd gone for a walk. No. No, she's gone to find Violet. Promise me you won't tell anyone. Scout's honour. Cath's mother married Violet's father. So they were stepsisters. But then her mother died in a terrible accident and the tragedy split the family up and she spent all the rest of her life alone. And yes, maybe she is a little bit odd. Violet? Cath. Do keep up, George. Is she dangerous? Oh, don't be daft, she was 11 years old. [light eerie music] You've had the buses, love. [car honking] I said you've had the buses, it's Christmas Eve. Should I get you a taxi? Go to rob a bank or what? Probably just wants to get out of Paignton for Christmas. Who can blame her? [Cath] Taxi! Wait! [cow mooing] [Violet] Supper's nearly ready. Great. Ah, you're gonna be a heartbreaker. [cow mooing] You like the farm, don't you son? Uncle Fergus says there's no future in it. All the cows are mad and the farmers are committing suicide. All right, Sam. Off and wash your hands. Mum, I'm sorry. You're not gonna want to hear this but we might have to sell the farm. She never liked it here. She never wanted to be a farmer's wife. It's nothing to do with Claire, it's just the economics of it. Just doesn't add up anymore. [Driver] Going to your family? That's nice. Why can't we wait and ask Valerie tomorrow? Why would Obergruppen Valerie tell us anything? Well supposing we get caught? They'll just think we're senile. I think we probably are. So long, lovebirds. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. [chuckling] [door clacking] [suspenseful music] [Old Woman] Lillian. What are we looking for? Whatever it was Cath didn't tell me. It's gorgeous, Violet, thank you. -[Jonna] Not on the table. -[Sam] But dad! It's all right mum, -I'll do it. -I'm on the top level! [Jonna] Come on, Sam. [Diana] Claire, what's for dessert? [Claire] Oh I was gonna do trifle. There's some yoghourts in the fridge. -Okay. -Not for me, thank you Diana. I've never liked the idea of yoghourt. Oh, sorry. I'm not blaming you, dear. What's that? [Violet] I don't know how you eat that stuff. Newfangled rubbish. It's neither one thing or the other. [Jonna] Yogurt's good for you. [Violet] A proper pudding's what's good for you. [Sam] Well then I get this one. [Rosie crying] Oh, you see what Valerie says about you, Lillian. George, listen. Stubborn, difficult, and hard to like. That's good, coming from her. Nevertheless, Miss Castle is an intelligent woman whose loneliness is mainly self-inflicted. George, there's a lot Cath didn't tell me. Heatherston Secure Unit, Home Office Pathologist, Offender profiling. Oh, god! It says she killed her own mother! Lillian, she's a murderer! But she said it was an accident. [Rosie crying] [Claire] Coming, sweetheart. -[windshield clacking] -Oh! * Lucky you * * Go to sleep * [Cath] Thank you. [Driver] Merry Christmas, then. One grain. Mhmm. Ooh. [Rosie babbling] Look at the car. Bye bye. [rain pattering] [wind howling] [family chattering] -Whoah! -Wooo. You all right? Here, Rosie here. Hello, Rosie. Lets have cheese and biscuits. -Yay! -Oh, bugger. I forgot the biscuits. I knew there was something. No more biscuits? I brought some. Oh, yay! Got more biscuits. Give me a kissy. [lightly eerie music] [music box tinkling] [tense music] Sammy, if you drink any more, you'll never sleep. It's like you when you work. [Jonna chuckling] [Diana] Thank you. [Jonna] Ah, lovely. -Biscuits! -Here's some cheese. [Diana] Wait. Help me put this to work, Sam. Silven, that one. Such an awful night out. There you go, lots of cheese for you. You are so mean. Give me a bigger piece. Come on. Biscuit. -Don't lean over. -Hey, wait, wait. [tense music] [door creaking] [rain splashing] [eerie music] [Violet] I didn't know you left the hospital, Kitty. I'd been in and out. I've been hearing your poor mother. [Cath] My mother's dead. No, I mean I've been hearing her in the spirit. What do you think she wants, Kitty? Cath. I'm Cath, I've been Cath for ages. You didn't know me, did you, when I came to your house? But I knew you, Violet. 60 years, I've never forgotten you. Why have you come here? [lamp squeaking] [Cath] I've come for Christmas. [Diana] Oh Sammy, darling, don't take any more cheese. You'll have bad dreams. My love, you're smothering him. [Diana sighing] Dreams of ghoulies and ghosties? I love lickety beasties. [everyone chuckling] And things, [Sam And Fergus] That go bump. [Claire] Ooh. [Sam] In the night. Power cut. I wanna see your family, all of them. Yeah, well, we have to get some candles first. They're up there, they're in that barn over there. Specially the baby. [tense music] [women screaming] [everyone laughing] [Diana] He always has his torch. Put your hands up! [Diana] Stop it. -Have some more cheese, son. -Sam, put this candle in there. [rain pattering] Fancy you married a man called Moon. Violet Moon. Toody moody Violet Moon. [chuckling] Tickling the ivories, torturing our ears. Anyway, I was always better than you. I got my grade five. [Cath] And your farm, and your fine son. And your nice retirement and your nice bungalow in Paignton. You got all those things, Violet. You're hurting me, Kitty. Cath. It's gotta be Cath. 'Cause everyone remembers Kitty and what she did. That's why it must always be Cath. I'm an old woman, I don't remember things. Remember, remember, remember, you must remember! That was a terrible thing you did, Catherine. And you were punished for it! You and your daddy left me all alone. But my daddy saw what you did. My daddy saw everything! [dad gasping] No. Your daddy didn't see me. He couldn't have. I was too far from the edge! I wish you'd never been born. [Dad] Sheena, what on earth is going on? I'm coming. [breathing heavily] But you, Violet. You could have told them it was an accident. You pushed her! You did it on purpose. You killed your mommy! It went perfectly, didn't it, Violet? Got me put away for 60 years, you did, so you could have your daddy all alone with you then. We were all right, me and my daddy until you two came along! Your mother was a monkey strumpet and she got what was coming to her. And so did you! Oh, you spiteful little- Argh! Ah! [groaning] [sombre music] [Sheena] I've got a problem with my shoe. I'll be ready in a minute. [Sheena screaming] You! You killed my mummy! Mummy? [Cath grunting] [bubbles gurgling] [sombre music] Ex directory? Oh dear. Could you just give me the address then? I see. Well, thanks anyway. [Lillian sighing] [Fergus] Don't know what on earth you were doing out there, mum. Thought we'd lost you. Oh, just remembering the old days. And thinking about the future. When did Cath Marks have a family? Since the day before yesterday. You should have told me about this silly trip of hers last night. Dirty little stop out. The quiet ones are always the worst. Oh god, as if I haven't got enough to worry about. Mr. Tarbuck himself's coming for Christmas lunch. You have both been extremely silly old women. Hello. Uncle Fergus? Can I have some milk, please? You know when I was younger, I really wanted to be a farmer. What's it now then? A particle physicist. [Fergus laughing] You don't mind, do you? I wanted to be an architect. [music box tinkling] [cow mooing] [light eerie music] Mum? You all right? Yeah, yeah. Come and get some breakfast. [Officer] So she hasn't seen this sister of her since, 1938. Ah. Miss Marks' been in and out of hospital all her life. That would be, Oh, psychiatric hospitals. Of course, Sergeant, yeah. Sugar? None for me. Three for him. The stop last night. Mmm. Dangerous at all, would you say? Oh. Well there's no suspicion she might have, you know, done herself a mischief? Look, Sergeant. Imagine you've had no family for 60 years, then yesterday you find out you've got a sister. And there's a baby grandchild and everything. And it's Christmas! Well of you trot, don't you? Have to be better than sticking around here. Oh, thank you very much. Hmm? [Sergeant] She's how old? 73. In good health? Oh, yes, excellent. Well. But there's no address for this family of hers? Oh, it was Lower something farm. On Dartmoor. That's all I can remember, I'm sorry. Oh. There you go. Ooh, thanks Di. Mmm, needed that. Sure you didn't want one? No, thanks. A bit later maybe. No alcohol for me, thank you. Ooh, cheap and cheerful as usual. Shh. [Claire] I know, we could always have packet red sauce. [Diana] Come on, Claire. Where's your Dunkirk spirit? [tense music] [Violet] Can I help you officers? [Sergeant] Mrs. Violet Moon? Yes. Some sort of problem, Sergeant? Oh this is my son, Fergus Moon. I'm Sergeant Pollard from Paignton. This is Constable Browning. We're looking for this lady, sir, the larger one of the two. No, I don't recognise either of them. Her name is Miss Catherine Marks. She went missing last night. Apparently she's your mother's sister. She hasn't got a sister. I was always an only child. [Sergeant] You won't mind if we take a look around then? Not at all. I'll go with them, son. Guided tour now. Oh, why didn't you invite your new friends in? We love a man in uniform. Mad old lady's supposed to have come up here last night. What, another mad old lady? Matching pair. An old lady claiming to be mum's sister. Your mum hasn't got a sister, has she? No. -[tray popping] -[Claire screaming] [gasping] Claire! Oh, oh, oh! Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. Claire, are you all right, are you all right? Are you sure? [Diana snickering] [Fergus laughing] I'm glad you think it's funny. Because if I hadn't been wearing these glasses you'd be scraping hot chestnuts out of my eyes. You're supposed to prick them, Di! They have to be pricked all over! Sorry. -Oh! -[tray clattering] [door slamming] A little too fat. Here, let me do that. Here you go. That's better. My grandma was a farmer's wife. Fantastic cook. Cooked all the food you're not allowed to eat anymore. Cholesterol city. Well, things aren't what they used to be. Isn't that right, Mrs. Moon? Take another look at the photograph, Mrs. Moon. Are you sure you don't recognise her? No, sorry. [tense music] [fence creaking] [Violet exclaiming] [Cath] Oh, no! Mrs. Moon? This railing. You wanna tell your son to get it seen to. Come on, you. Mrs. Moon, we're all done. [Diana] I was just saying to Fergus, shouldn't they be sending out search parties or something? I mean if some mad old lady came staggering up here last night in all that weather? [Fergus] But surely we'd have heard a car, wouldn't we? [Claire] A car did stop at the top of the lane. I saw the headlights. You're supposed to blot them now. I beg your pardon? You know, a tissue. Mwah, mwah. Ugh. Well, Lillian. Police went to that farm you told them about, middle of nowhere, apparently. And? Ha, and nothing. They couldn't find her? Apparently they had never heard of her. I have my doubts about Cath. Borderline dementia if you ask me. [doorbell dinging] Oh! Cath never came back last night, and now the police have been to wherever it was she went and she wasn't there. They've met Violet and Violet said she didn't know her. You coming in for a minced pie? It's my fault she went there! Now I'm going to get her back. Are you coming or what? Oh! [Rosie babbling] The dead have arisen. [Jonna] Merry Christmas. God, Jonna, you really can't sleep ring gun, you know? I suppose breakfast out of the question? -I've just load a fresh -Come on dad, we've been -waiting hours! -Pot of tea. Let's open the presents, -dad. -That'd be lovely, Mrs. Moon. It's dark in here. -Give me my present, dad. -Power's not still off, is it? Don't worry, -There's still plenty light. -Hurry up. Merry Christmas. Oh, thanks, dad. Merry Christmas, Fergus. -Merry Christmas, Jonna. -Thank you, Jonna. -Oh, presents! -Put them all up here. -Okay. -Lovely. This woman Catherine Marks. Are you sure that name doesn't ring any bells? Whoah, thanks dad! -That's all right, son. -It's just odd, isn't it that she'd tell people she's your sister if she's never even met you. Oh, I meet all sorts of odd people in my line of work, people who get funny ideas. So you're saying that you might have met her after all? No, no, never met her. [Eerie Voice] Chickadee. [eerie music] [screaming] Oh! Rosie. Oh, oh! You're all right, it's all right. I don't believe her 'cause she bloody well does it on purpose! Now, Claire, it was an accident! But she could have scalded Rosie! [Fergus] Yes, it was an accident! Yeah it's over now. No it's not. Merry Christmas! [laughing] You want to get yourself back to the home, Ms. Castle. You're in danger of missing your Christmas dinner. If you didn't find my friend, you can't have looked properly. Why don't we just take a seat for a minute, eh? The lady we spoke to told us she didn't have a sister. You sure you saw Violet Moon? Yeah. And her son, the farmer. Miss Castle, they both confirmed Mrs. Moon is an only child. You showed her the picture? [Sergeant] Yes. And she didn't recognise Cath? The thing you might not know, Sergeant is Violet and Cath lost touch 60 years ago because- Shh. Because? Because Violet's father married Cath's mother who fell off the battlements of a castle and she was accused of pushing her. And she didn't, you see, it was an accident. But she got the blame anyway and ended up in prison for murder. Cath, not Violet. I said Cath. And it wasn't prison, Sergeant, it was a hospital. Miss Castle. Are you sure your friend doesn't have the, what should we say, a particularly active imagination? She wasn't making it up. Now let go of my hand, you patronising creep. Come on. Before we go back now, we can put the capon in the oven and still be eating in front of the queen. Roast potatoes, brussel sprouts. Got blue onion in the fridge. That Sergeant fancies himself something rotten. I'm going to show him. One of them luxury Christmas puddings with real brandy butter. Wait George, -I'm thinking. -What? No. That picture! That picture the police took up to the farm! What about it? It had me in as well! Me who's been joining hands with Violet Moon to come to the spirit world for the best part of five years! So it wasn't only Cath she denied knowing, it was you as well! Mmmm. Come on. [waves crashing] [trapdoor creaking] [eerie music] [Eerie Voice] Chickadee. [door thudding] [music box tinkling] [Sam] Aunt Claire! We need you downstairs! [music box tinkling] Oh, Sam, that looks lovely. Haven't you got a lovely eye. Artistic, aren't you? You get that from your mother, I expect. Nothing very artistic about our side of the family, I'm afraid. This was going off on its own. Yes, it does that. Can you fix it for me, Fergus? Oh, Fergus, don't start fiddling with that thing now, not in the middle of all this cooking. Did you want something, Sam? Turkey needs basting. Does it feel hot in here to anybody? Hardly, darling. They are a bit pink. Maybe it's the sherry. Tell you what, Fergus, I think this might be worth something. [Fergus] Not in its present condition. [tense music] [Violet] Got memories, that box has. [Sam] Why don't you fix it, why don't you fix it? Oh! [pan clattering] Ow! [pan clattering] [door clanging] The wife's. Magnificent troublemaker in her prime, that woman. Spent six months in a tent on Green and Common. [coughing] You would have liked her, Lill. Lillian. I don't know when I last took it out. It'll enjoy a little run then. [birds squawking] The wife did all that. Sparking plugs, alternators, everything. [exhaust popping] Much better than me at all that stuff, she was. Oh, pick up, George. Look, we got here. How'd you know the neighbor's in? She's not. My son the accountant's coming in a minute. I'm spending Christmas with my son, the accountant. Why are you talking like that? Because she did. [window shattering] [George] No, Lillian. [glass clattering] I thought you liked magnificent troublemakers. I said I married one. I didn't say I liked them. Maybe the sentence will be community service. Gardening, pro rate pension or something like that. I mean real all right pensioners. [door knocking] How you doing? I'm all right. Oh, what's all this? It's Violet, she left it in the attic. Said she didn't have room for it in the bungalow. [Diana] So you're going through Violet's old family album. Why exactly? [Claire] Looking for secret sister. I mean, what do you think? Violet hasn't changed much, has she? Why does she frighten you so much? Di, she wants to get rid of me. [Diana scoffing] [lightly tense music] Smells all right to me. She did have quite a few. Stress, I believe you young people call it. [Eerie Voice] Chickadee. Look, she left the Ouija board on the stairs, she dropped tea all over me and I think she put something in my sherry. Oh, Claire. You'll be telling me next I forgot to prick the chestnuts on purpose. This was Violet's room, wasn't it? Her room, her house, her farm. Her son. God, that's a beautiful view. [Violet] Well, you can see why she feels a strain. [pan sizzling] These are lovely and cold. [Violet] And of course, with Diana being here, and Sam. I'd be a lot happier if the two most important women in my life would try a bit harder to get on together. Well she says you weren't planning on having another baby. Can't afford the one we've got. Oh, Fergus, you must have a son. Otherwise there'll be no chance of saving the farm. Come on mum, you read the newspapers, you know the situation. We're running at a loss. I'm destroying my milkhouse now because it costs too much even to get them to market. What you need is more investment, more money coming in, more support. What do you think Claire is doing information technology for, the good of her health? Come next year, she's gonna be back at work full time. She'll still only be a secretary. Sam! Dinner's ready, my sweet. Now Diana, she brings home money. She's a proper businesswoman. I mean look at her lovely clothes. She's so competent and beautiful too. I mean, she is beautiful, isn't she? She doesn't know why she married that fool Jonna. She told me so herself. And she's got Sam. I mean that's your future. Your son, Sam. Don't ever let me hear you say anything like that again. I mean it, mum. I don't want you causing trouble in the family. Well, I just want what's best for you. Mum. Claire is my wife. Rosie is my daughter. Oh, I love Rosie, you know I do. Why don't you show it a bit more, then? I'm not asking you to be best friends with Claire. Just try to be a bit more of a grandmother to Rosie. All right, son, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Champagne, fantastic. -Hooray! -Spanish fizz actually. Starving. Turkey's looking better, Fergus. Claire not coming down? -Anything I can do Mrs. Moon? -Maybe in a while. -That looks gorgeous. -Take those vegetables there. And Sam, take this gravy, will you love? All right, in we go. Jonna, you can light the candles. [Jonna] Yes. Come on Sam, hurry up. [family chattering] You'll have missed your dinner. Oh, hours ago. We get dinner here at the time normal people are having their elevenses. Want a fig roll? No. Now what magic plan are you hatching now? [Lillian] We're going to need a better car. Anyone but Valerie's. Hmm, bit of a sardine can, yes. But I know where she keeps her keys. [car honking] Oop. Ignorant git. Pardon my French. Anyone'd think he owned the bloody road. He does. Smile and wave, George. Smile and wave. That's Mr. Tarbuck, the owner of Happy Haven. But forget the sardine can. Oh! Mr. Tarbuck. You're a little later than we expected. And I can't stay long neither. [Valerie] Oh, this is sudden. You're my third today. Oh, I see. Well don't just stand there, woman. Find me somewhere to put these! Ooh, Mr. Tarbuck. I must say that new gym's doing wonders for your physique. Oh? I haven't got time for nookie, you daft cow, it's Christmas day! Ho, ho, ho! Well, they've had their dinner. I see. Ho ho ho. Right, then. All together. [light piano music] Mr. Tarbuck, we already had this one this morning. Oh, come on, Valerie, do your duty. * Ding dong merrily on high * * In heaven bells are ringing * * Ding dong verily the sky * * Is riven with angels singing * She fancies him. She does. [Donna giggling] Now birthing she should be, that one. * Hosanna in excelsis * You know their trouble, these old people? They're all too bloody obedient! -Too bloody obedient! -Oh, Ernest. Come on, come on. Hey go, go! [car starting and revving] [Donna giggling] There you go. Hey Fergus, could I have a topper please? [Fergus] Yeah, sure. He'll get another bottle down his neck, insert his backside into that armchair, rant his head off for a bit during the Queen's speech. Mmm, God bless her. Fall asleep during the national anthem and snore all the way through the Harrison Ford movie. Looking into the future, Diana, consulting your crystal ball again? Oh I don't need a crystal ball, Jonna. You're too predictable for that. Mum. Truth is I won't be doing any of those things 'cause there's no electricity. No, we're gonna be reduced to breathing life into the dead art of conversation. Oh, shut up. What's your star sign, Violet? [Sam] Dad. You'd never know listening to my wife that she's a pisces. You know, poetic, melancholy and kind. [Sam] Dad, don't! Jonna would rather have us like him, boring, pretentious and bald! Just stop it, will you? Just stop it! I'm going out now. [Diana] Now look what you've done. [Jonna] Sam? I'm just gonna nip up and see how Claire's doing. Rosie. -This. -A flattery. Oh, thank you. Just a little something. Oh. Thank you very much. [Valerie] Miss Irma! Not gonna watch your telly, Ernest? No. This is much more entertaining than bloody telly. [Donna laughing] [Ernest laughing] Valerie! [eerie whimsical music] [Operator] All units from control. [Sergeant] All units, you know fine well it's only us. [Constable] Rudolph the red nosed reindeer out. [Operator] There's a Happy Haven Residential Home For the Elderly complaining Mr. Lindsey Tarbuck. [Sergeant] Well, he rolls up one treasure like he does a heater. [Operator] Jaguar XKR stolen from the premises. Suspects are a male IC1 and female IC1, destination unknown. Confirm age of suspects. [Operator] Both of the criminals both approaching 80, Sarge. Miss Castle and her boyfriend. Yeah, I know where they're going. Show us responding. [light music] I drove bigger than this in the war, George. Armoured vehicles on occasion. Never had an accident. I had hoped to die in my bed. Be dark soon. Fusspot. Here she is. -Oh, hey. -Hi. Hey. -Welcome back. -Are you feeling better? [Claire] Yes, thanks. Oh, pudding's up. [Diana] Oh, brandy, Fergus. Oh yeah. [Claire] Can I light it? Can you give her a lighter, Fergus, mine's broken. Oh, there's one on the mantel piece. This is my favourite bit of Christmas. [Fergus] Oh Sam, just in time. [Jonna] There you go, here. [Fergus] Come on Sam, proper pudding. Oh, let us pray for a flame, oh my best beloveds. Concentrate, Sam. Can we just light it, please? [tense music] Oh, my god! [Diana] Put your drink on it! Just put it out! [Rosie crying] [Diana] There's a bit more. [Claire] Oh, here, my darling. No harm done then. I'll serve up then. Yeah, let's eat. [Fergus] All right, Rosie. [Claire] She's all right, okay. [Violet] There. That's for Claire. [Diana] Okay. Hope you didn't forget to put a sixpence in, mum. Never miss. And the brandy butter's there. For Sam there. Sammy. Brandy butter. No, it looks great. Oh! [tense music] Glass. How much more proof do you want, Fergus? She made the pudding, she cut it. She chose who got which piece. You think you know her. You don't know her. You did have a sister, didn't you, Violet? I've seen her photograph, and so has Diana. So where is she now, hmm? Where is your sister now? [eerie music] She's dead. [tense music] [Rosie babbling] And you never told anyone? It was best forgotten, Fergus. Even your dad never knew. My mother died, my father married again. His second wife got a daughter, my stepsister Kitty. About my age, a bit older. Didn't last long. [Diana] They got divorced? No, she died. His new wife died. She fell, it was some sort of accident and there was a scandal. I was very young, I don't remember properly. Anyway, nobody told you anything those days. And then the war came and my father was sent overseas. And he was killed. Go on, son. Go and get that milking seen to. My dad, my lovely dad. He used to say I was his best little girl. His old chickadee. [tense music] She didn't fall, you know, Diana. She was pushed. Things had got very bad between her and my stepsister. Her own daughter pushed her? -But that's- -I was there. I saw it all. And I had to tell my daddy what I saw, didn't I? Good riddance to bad rubbish, daddy. Don't blame yourself, Violet. [eerie music] [car whooshing] -[tyres screeching] -Ooh! I see, so she still hasn't turned up yet? Right, thank you officer. Yes, happy Christmas. [Diana] Claire. Di, look what I found. Death certificate. Her beloved father, who she just told you died a hero in the war, he killed himself in Torquay. She's a bare-faced liar. You know the old lady that's supposed to have turned up here last night? I just spoke to the police, nobody's heard from her. Do you remember I saw a car stop at the top of the lane last night and then Violet went out and she was out for quite a while? What if that old lady is her sister? I mean what if she's lying dead somewhere on the farm? And what if Violet, the senile serial killer achieves her master plan and murders you with a poisoned mince pie? Claire, what is it with you? You're completely paranoid. -[music box tinkling] -[eerie music] Okay. Amazing what you can do with a Swiss Army Knife. I know, it's a wicked present, dad. Haven't you two got anything more useful you could be doing? Go. -Go, that's it. -Okay? Now for the final piece. Where do you say you found that? [Sam] In the mud by the slurry pit. [Rosie crying] [water splashing] Oh, now. Come on, Rosie. Come on. There's a good girl, come on. [music box tinkling] No don't light it with that, dad. Light it with this. Sam! No, it's okay, I used it already. Oh. Yeah. Sam found your missing sister, Violet, look. [Sam] I found it by the slurry pit. [tense music] What now? [Lillian] What's that sound? [George] The emergency generator. They must have a power cut. No, listen. [George] Blech. I don't know what I just trod in but it wasn't very nice. [Lillian] Look! Is that Violet? For God's sake, Fergus. You've only got to look at him. He's the image of you. We can't keep this up forever. Jonna brought him up. He's his father now. Sam loves him. Diana, what we... It wasn't even a one night stand. You I was so drunk, I don't know how I managed it. Come on, girl. [cow mooing] It's only a matter of time before Claire sees it too. Even your mother knows. Things have got to stay the way they are. [eerie tense music] I don't mean to be hard, but it was a long time ago. Fergus, you begged me to marry you. And you said no, and Claire said yes. Oh, and we have to pay for that mistake for the rest of our lives? It wasn't a mistake. [slap whacking] I love Claire. [slap whacking] [gate clanging] [Diana] Sam. Violet's got the baby. Good. Give poor Claire a break. No, mum. Mum. Come on, let's get tonight's pants organised. [Sam] But mum, listen! Rosie's gone. Gone where? Violet's got her. She's out here somewhere. Oh my god. [Sam] That's what I've been trying to tell you, mum. [Claire] Violet! Sammy, stay there. [Claire] Violet! Look, this is hers. It's Cath's, I gave it -to her for Christmas. -Violet! [tense music] Give her to me, you bitch! Thank you God. [Claire screaming] Fergus! Fergus, quick! [pipe clanging] She pushed Claire in. She pushed Claire in the slurry! [Rosie crying] No! No! What have you done! Fergus. Claire, Claire! Claire! How could you do this, Violet? I defended you! Claire! Help me! Oh my gosh. Cath. Are you a doctor? All right please, everybody move right back, give us some space. All right sir, we'll get you out of there. Browning, get an ambulance! All right sir, come. [Fergus] Take her. Dad? Can we go home soon, dad? Now, look what you made me do. Power's back on. There's nothing more we can do, sir. [Lillian] Sergeant, I'm sorry- Not now, Miss Castle. You can see what I'm dealing with here. But Sergeant, look. This is my friend's torch. I've got a body here! But look. Why don't you just tell me what happened out there, Mrs. Moon? Mrs. Moon? I've told you it was an accident. No it wasn't. You pushed her. I still can't believe it. She's always had it in for her. Twisted old cow! Pushed my sister in and killed her! [tense music] You know son, this farm will all be yours one day. You ask your father. [Sam] Dad? Sam. Come on, Sam. I'm taking you home. Fergus, a farm needs a proper family to survive. Man, wife and sons. Don't talk to me. Don't ever talk to me again. [ominous music] I want to go with her. Certainly. I'll have to clean you up, right. My poor Cath. Not much of a life was it? But in the end I just made things worse. I'm a meddling old sow. Lillian, don't. Nobody could believe Violet capable of two murders. Three. What do you mean? Constable, evidence. It's obvious, isn't it? Cath spent 60 years for something Violet did. And it's time Violet paid for it. [music box tinkling] [tense music] Daddy? I'm still your chickadee. Daddy? [eerie music] [Lillian] Oh, I made some tea. Oh, thanks, Miss Castle. Nobody takes sugar, do they? Oh, don't worry, I'll get it. Dried up old spinster. I bet you're still a virgin. You killed Cath's mother, didn't you? You pushed her off the battlements and you blamed Cath. You got her locked away for 60 years. No wonder you were scared when I brought her back to you. A slutty woman and a fat ugly brat. We were all right, me and my daddy till those two came along. You know what, Violet? Cath never worked that out. You killed her for nothing. She didn't know your secret. He died too. Broken heart, that's what they said. [eerie music] That's what the seances were for, isn't it? Trying to contact your dead father. Never came. Never. Not once. Oh, Violet. Mind you, neither did your boring bloody brother. You had a family and you destroyed it. Your father, your stepsister, her mother. And that poor girl out there in the slurry tonight. No, I didn't kill her. I didn't kill her. All right, Miss Castle. You've done enough. -Mrs. Moon. -How could I have killed her? Mrs. Moon, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to accompany my Constable to he police station. Come along now please. I had the baby in my arms. [Sergeant] Come on, Mrs. Moon. Give her to me, you bitch! Come on. -I had the baby in my arms! -Come along. Don't upset yourself now, Mrs. Moon, come on. [music box tinkling] [Fergus] Who's there? Don't worry. It's only me. So Violet tried to pin it on Diana? Good god, she got no shame? The lying old toad. I tell you what, George. Hmm? That's the last time I'm going to spend Christmas pining because I haven't got a proper family. [George laughing] [Lillian sobbing] Here. Here. [laughing] Got one of those fig rolls? I thought you didn't like 'em. I could get used to them. All right, but just the one. I'm not gonna have you spoiling your appetite. 'Cause there's no law that says you can't have your capon and all the trimmings at midnight, is there? This your car, madam? You know very well it's not, Sergeant. Take it back tomorrow, eh? Tomorrow's Boxing Day. The day after tomorrow then. Will you drive, George? Yes, of course, go on. It's a shame this car's got to go back to Happy Haven. The car's going back, Lil. But you're not. [light music] [car starting] [car revving] Join hands with me oh my best beloveds. And we will fare safely into the world beyond. Close eyes with me, all my best beloveds and we will see what may not be seen. Meet again those who have been gathered home. Now answer me, you sleeping spirits. Who will wake and answer me? [eerie music] [door creaking] Hello, chickadee. [Claire laughing] [music box tinkling] [light music]
