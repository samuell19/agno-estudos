I know what I mean. We're not supposed to leave the resort trip. It's a poor country. I know. It's not their fault. They have a high crime rate and the guide says they target foreigners. Maybe a little therapeutic mugging could fix my back. Come on. I, I'm sure it's safe If the Bowers are going. They come here every year. You're just happy you found your fan club.

That's surname, uh, son from the, uh, as met my uncle Gro tr, who works at the Maka Girl Princess Resort. I'm told he runs a Jewish car yesterday morning. James, I'm going to ask if that's true, but before your answer, I should explain that my uncle will be in a great field of trouble if he rented you the car. So for his benefits, would you agree to answer that he did not rent it to you? What would that change for me? , nothing. It's just something I would appreciate given this situation. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Did the resort worker named TR went yesterday morning at the Princess. No. Good. The Bower couple. Gar and Alban already explained that after stealing a car from a man named throw trash, the Paka girl Princess, he went on a joy ride with your wife up the coast there you became intoxicated and hit a farmer named Myron. Myron killing him instantly. You fled the accident without contacting the police, and Mr. Mar's party was found by his family yesterday morning. Your wife has confirmed this account She was quite forthcoming and our federal law. And Lika, if you are responsible for the death and for men, including in the case of an ab affordable accident, as l as some should kill you to preserve the family's honor duty on level B, what, what would you say in the case that there's no son. The state will take on the draw, but luckily Mr. Myron has two sons, ages nine and 13. But, but, but, but if not, I'm sorry. Please, please, James, it is unlikely that we will kill you. Are you aware of the revised process of doubles Act for international visitors and diplomats? Physical doubles? This is the dear of my government office to fund visitors near situation as part of our longstanding tourism initiative for Significant. Some state will build double to stand in for your execution.

But this one, The first time. It's horrible. It looks just like me. You'll both be present for the execution. Oh no, I don't wanna see it. This is nonnegotiable. Oh my God. No, please don't.

Yes, I understand. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your patience. Mr. Foster. Would you like us to extend your room booking Mr. Foster? Sorry. Um, is the room still available?

As soon as I can. It's a shame. James, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have a drink with me and let meet me please. The first year we came ALS working as a consultant and the construction of a new resort. The what Breed two. Do you know it? No, it's just a few compounds over from here north up the beach. They're installing an infinity pool, one of Alban's designs, a little pervy with a glass bottom that you could look up into from the bar. But the plates split and fell off the crane and two workers were killed. The owner of the put the blame on Alban, and so we were arrested. Penalty of death and we made a discovery. Then if you have now discovered a discovery, are you upset? Maybe me. Think of it as a gift. You said you were looking for inspiration. There's something to the experience isn't there? You come out of it feeling it's hard to explain, which I can see it in your eyes, if you know what I mean. Will you come to our bill tonight? There are a few others we've been hounded over the years who share our relat Your secret. Oh, James. James. You mail it. You're completely transformed. You look so beautiful. Now. Can see the beauty pouring. I love you here. Quickly. Yes, quickly. Yes. Yes. That's great. A little bit more here. Here come. Thank you. Come, come, come, come. Everyone. Everyone. This is the new friend I was telling you about. James. This is Charles. Jennifer, Dr. Mother, and beautiful. Be . Nice to meet you. Do you know that Be's father is a film producer? Huh? Maybe turn your book into the movie so you're a writer. Sort of. Sort of . What does that mean? James wrote a very brilliant book that I love. Okay, so then what is this book about? Don't harass the man. He just said a very bad day. . It's quite all curious. Fact, new zombie. You don't have to be afraid, James. We are all zombies here. Well, you'll certainly a fleshy too. Please, ladies. Everyone here is a brother James. You don't understand Lika yet, but they are very generous with discipline, especially if they know you can't pay. very conservative outside the results. very religious. They will kill you for drugs. sodomy, . Can you guess which one of us was sodomy? Honestly, it's amazing that anyone is still alive in this country. You know James, I'm glad you could come tonight. It's a great time to have you with us. Dr. Mood In is rating of people and your, the token doubling. , that's Bob, please. I was wondering if I could ask you a question while you're still fresh as they say. Sure. Do you worry they got the wrong man? Oh God, do. Do you think, I mean, looking back on it, that they killed real James. I mean, that was my biggest fear after my own experience. Because you wake up in that little room for all you know, they could have just swapped you out. Hard to say what happened while you were asleep. So what does it matter? You have to let it go. I let it go. How can I? I'll never know if I'm really myself for as long as I live. Exactly. So who cares? What do you think, James? Do you fear you may have just witnessed your own demise? I can only hope You feeling more? Yeah. Yeah. Well just, um, maybe I had too much to drink. I don't think that's, uh, first thing is always difficult. It's like a new skin working itself into place. And you, okay, so I can see something special happening. I have this pressure. Am I. You trust me tonight? He got it from one of the cleanings. Come, James. James, why don't you come over here for a moment. I have a proposition for you. Don't worry about this gun. I hear you have a passport problem. Is that right? That could be a lot of trouble in a place like this. I tell you what, I will talk to my connections in immigration and see if I can help. If you'll play a little game with us tonight. Oh, we just have a little plan tonight, James. Just a bit of fun. Yes. Tell him about the mission. The mission. Yes. Early this week, the owner of the Bat, Ray two Resort, he was awarded a medal for promoting Li Prosperity, and there was a ceremony on the beach. We find out the owner lives in the house just up the hill, so we decided tonight we'll go get the medal for ourselves. Just a little game to play often. It's actually rather important. Jewish James, I mean, after all, he did have us executed. At a certain point, if you don't respond to an insult like that, it was such a cow that you just fall to the ground and never get up again. What do you say? Or maybe we just off you now so you don't give us away. A perfect like. Have you ever fired a gun? It would be so easy. When everybody gets this job, Hey, what are your kids up 10 here? Just plain checking. Oh, have you seen many has in this place? You are going to want drink and you're going to Monte Cigar. You have beautiful tests, sir. I'm really starting to like you. We need to get him inside. Right now, my building is just unclear to the right. It's okay. I need some towel. They really should have water in here. Charles, do you have any water on you? I took my bag, sweetheart. Why don't you be a gentleman and give Gabby your seat because I'm old. I went for a colonoscopy last month and it was like looking at a painting by Jackson Pollup. . James, do you know why the Dublin tradition is unique to Lee Toka? I'm starting to think it's just a poetic flare. We spend years trying to reproduce the process in the lab, but. Far too literal. We just never take connection. Hi, we've been waiting in here for hours. You feel you've been inconvenienced? Well, our country is not a playground for foreign children. It sometimes seems, we have forgotten this, but maybe not today. We've tested the limits of our hospitality, and today I'm feeling inspired to make a statement. What do you say? Yes, please, Hey, hey, hey. We're ready to. What's wrong with you? With me? I'm leaving. I don't have a passport. Well, then I guess you get to stay. They told me I've already paid. Is this a dream? It would make more sense. You've gone wrong around the eyes. Like one of those crabs in the daddy. Wait. I am left today. That may be for the best. We've been together 10 years. It's none of my business, but I live really think she's due to. Men are trained by women like em to see themselves as weak. You can take some work, can take some blood. I don't know about the rain is coming. What's that? It's called the Y Gate. It's a traditional, the token root drug. Got it from all of the guards. What does it do? It's a loose solution. Drug use is heavily restricted in the modern state. This is considered to be religious. Oh, that's horrible. You come to like it. Come on. That's so loud. You know James, I spoke to my son-in-law about your passport. What you knew you knew, passport. He said it's thresh. Who is the problem? The detective Thresh is holding you back from leaving probably hoping to bring you in again. And Phillip is pretty police piggy bank. So the tokens only understand one thing. You need to show 'em that you are the dominant in this conflict. Yeah, they're like the booms, like the balloons, but we think by not just the thing. Trigeminal Neural James. It seems the detective is due for a glycerol injection tonight at Lethal Brain Spy. Hey, Jeff James. Any trouble. There was a police van almost riding me down. No, they just filled out their bus.

Maybe I'll bring the devil here and you can both fuck me. Have you ever tried that tonight, James? So un. James, come James Little baby. Yeah, go little baby. You're so pathetic, James. A real stucky baby. I can always pick out your stucky. Laura, what a joke. This whole time we've been laughing at you, you're just a bunch of fun for us. Vacation. Such terrible. I can't that James, you remember that We had to get you into trouble. Turns out you are such an idiot. You did it yourself. I never read your book. Would you believe that? I'm a good actress, . It's hard to look. One shitty book six years ago that nobody read bad reviews. You're so James to actually believe that we read it. It's sort of funny, but really anything, it's depressing. I do have a review with me, James, have you read this one? The variable she as bad as to recognize his own lack of talent, newcomer James W. Foster Overcompensates with pretension Fail. String that only serves to emphasize how truly terrible this debut really is. Sheth is a book that has nothing to say and lacks the words to say it.

Hello. Come. It's okay. It's okay. Come forward. See, we're going to fix you, James. I know it's been hard, but believe me when I say that we are on a mission of mercy, it's time for you to shed that disgusting laal mind of yours and find out what kind of a creature you really are. Bring the dog. The dog is here for you to complete your transformation. Any free blood. Can you release your past? Sacrifice the dog James. Kill the dog. Fuck you. I'll call you. Pick up the knife, James. It's good. You pick it up. Well, I landed 10, so I'll, I'll be home around 11, 11 30. I'm so sorry, babe. Really? Yeah. I miss you. Okay. Hey, I should probably get going.
