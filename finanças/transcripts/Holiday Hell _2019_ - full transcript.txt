- Hello? Is anyone here? - Good evening. I wasn't expecting anymore customers tonight. In fact, I was about ready to close up the shop for the weekend. - I'm sorry, I know it's really last minute with tomorrow being Christmas Eve and all, but I was hoping to find a present for my sister. - Your sister? I see. And her interests run more toward the unusual, I presume? - Yeah, to say the least. She's always been the strange one in the family. But Christmas got away from me this year and so I was looking for some local shops that might have something that she would like and I came up with you. Well, I would be happy to help you but, uh, it is quite late. - It's just, you're my last hope. We do our gift exchange tomorrow night and I have to find her something perfect. Will you help me? - You know, most of the people that come into this shop, they like to look around, they ask questions, but they don't particularly like to spend money. So. - I am not one of those people. - Oh, clearly you're not. Well,. All right, fine. I'll be happy to help you. So, question is what suits your sister's tastes? Because I have many things in here. Human skulls, Ouija boards, coffins, caskets, taxidermy, and many other singular items. And I have to tell you that everything, all of the objects in this shop, have a story behind them. If they don't have a story, I will not sell them. Which is why I call my shop Never Told. All the objects in here have a story that's never been told. So, have a look around. - What's the story with that mask? - Oh, the mask, you have a good eye. This mask was retrieved in the ashes of a fire, a house fire. - Did anyone die? - Oh, yes, several people. And not all from the fire. - What do you mean? - Well, this mask belonged to a very strange little girl. And all the kids would make fun of her. They called her Doll-face. - Jesus. I thought we were gonna do something romantic for Valentine's Day. - Here we are, girls. They call it The Inferno 'cause things get a little hot. - Shut up, Jon, God, you're so stupid. - Come on, girl, Chyna and Julie already know I'm gonna heat up your panties tonight. - Asshole! - Come on, Mira, I'm just playing, girl. - No, it's the 320 exit. Yeah, you'll see Jon's stupid gas guzzler out front. Some place, huh? - Oh my God, you are so right. That mascara totally gave me the confidence I needed to tell him it was over. - I told you, babe, you've just gotta get those lashes plumped and you feel like the baddest bitch in town. - And he was texting me like, "Babe, you can't treat me like this," cry face, cry face, cry face. I was like, "You have to treat a queen with respect," crown. I'm just so glad I talked to you first. - Oh my God, I'm so glad I talked to you too. - You have just got to meet my sister. She's really pretty, you would totally love her. - Didn't Paul tell you? This place belonged to Ken and Barb Doll. It's been sitting empty for years since the murders. - The bitch went and chopped up her husband and son on Valentine's Day. Total psycho. The daughters went crazy, got sent to some nuthouse after that. This is a little anniversary party. - I'm kinda the one to blame for it. My idea. - Chyna told us about this place a few weeks ago. We've been partying here ever since. No power, running water, but got these dope camping lights. - Great. - The house technically still belongs to the girls but, you know, they're still locked up, so, it's just been sitting here empty waiting for a bunch of crazy kids like us to come and make use of it. - We might as well since no one else is. - Momma Doll must have been a pain freak. She cut her own jugular at the end. - Ew, gross. - Bullshit. - I wouldn't shit ya. You're my favorite turd. - You guys were always so mean to those girls. - Me? How about you? Didn't you snot rocket in your drink at lunch once? Come on, let's go get lost. Oh, man. I can't believe you brought Julie along for Kenny. That dude will stick his dick in anything. - You're so mean. - Man, I can't help it. That mutey gives me the creeps. Where are we going? - Some place where we can get some one-on-one. Got a little mood lighting going on. - Who lived up here? It looks like a little girl's room. - Who cares, baby? These people were weirdos. Fuck it. Anyways, it's a good place to touch on your body. - I'm gonna get a beer, do you want one? - Yeah. I'll just look around. - This sucks. I shoulda brought my own car. Great, then it'll be a real party. - Where's the beer? So, Julie, you finally gonna get popped tonight? Maybe that's what you need. Some good D to help you hit the high notes. - This is, like, the lamest party ever. Let's roam. - O-M-G, I was just thinking that. You two bitches have fun being lame A-F. - You know, maybe she's right. No, Mira, you dumbass. You do need to get laid. Kenny's not that hard to look at. Plus, I hear he's got a nice penis. - Whoops. What are you wearing? - Kiss My Face. - What? - Kiss My Face lotion. Do you like it? It's totally natural, no testing on animals. - Yeah, totally, I'm, I'm so down for PETA. - Hey, do you want to go some place with me to finish this off? - Yeah, totally. Let's go to the basement. - O-M-G, that's totally creepy. - Give me your hand. - But it's too dark. - That's why God created iPhones, babe. Come on. - Okay. - Hey, I got you a beer. Jon. - Here. Damn, get after it. Oh my God, your hands are so soft. Literally just like a baby panda. And your eyes really sparkle in the light. - O-M-F-G, you dyke! - Wait, Sandy! Stupid. - Hey, Sandy, what's wrong with you? - Mind your own fucking business, loser. Who are you, anyways? - I've known you since the second grade. - Shows what an impression you've made! - You know what? It's been a long time coming. Hey, bitch! You better watch your fucking back! Oh, Paul and Kenny are here. - Howdy, Julie. - Come on, I need some alone time. - Yes, ma'am. When a lady is in a need, a gentleman must rise to the occasion. - Hey. - You don't know how long I've wanted you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. You know you gotta be knee-high to get on this ride. Oh, girl, hold on, watch the teeth. Yeehaw! - I'm so fucking stupid. - Even though they offered me a scholarship, I'm waiting to hear back from UCLA. I think my chances are good. Hey. Come on, Julie, I, I thought you were here for me. I'm just trying to be spontaneous, you know? Just trying to get famil-- Fuckin' cunt. Hey there, doll face. Where did you come from? You from school? No, I woulda remembered you. Why don't you come have a drink with me, you can tell me the name of your teddy bear. Pretty? Pretty? I'm sure you're pretty enough. Pretty! Pretty. Pretty! - Why? Why did you kill my sister? She didn't do anything to you! She was just confused! We only wanted those who tortured us. Even after I took care of our parents, we were treated like rats in that madhouse. Now, now, Dolly, don't listen to those kids. With your new mask, you'll always be pretty. We finally escaped. New names but old scars. See, that's the thing, you were different. You weren't like the others. Look what you did! Now, get into that basement and stay there. You'll always be pretty. Why'd you have to kill my sister? My pretty sister. - And the house burned down to the ground soon after that. And the mask was found in the basement, amongst the ashes. And they never found Chyna. She went missing, just like her sister. Now, some say they both burned up in there together. But others, others weren't quite so sure. - Do you think vengeance brought her peace? - Well, I know I'd feel better. Wouldn't you, Miss, I'm sorry, we haven't been properly introduced. My name is Rosemont, Thaddeus Rosemont. - Amelia. - Amelia? Have we met somewhere before, Amelia? - I don't think so. - Well, I have the strangest feeling that we have. But I must be mistaken. So, what do you say about the mask? - I say I'm not so sure about that one. - That's fine, we'll keep looking. - What about that doll? She might like that. - Oh, the doll. That doll has a very interesting story. It is no ordinary plaything. It was made in Germany, by a rabbi. Centuries ago, very old. And I got it from some very distraught parents. - Happy Hanukah, Kevin. - Happy Hanukah, son. Now. Are you ready for your last present? We hope you like it. We got it a very old shop in Germany. Now, that is a very special doll. Very old. It was made by a rabbi a long time ago. - There's only one of them in the whole world. And now he belongs to you. - Thanks, Mom, thanks, Dad. - You're welcome. Hopefully he'll be a good friend for you. - And he'll keep you company while we're away on our business trip. - When are you leaving? - Tonight. Well, don't you remember? We have to leave late to take the red eye. - But you can play with your doll while we're away. I'm sure you two will have lots of fun. - Yeah, and Lisa is coming over to watch you for the weekend. - Don't you like Lisa? - I guess. Lisa, hi! - Hi, Mr. Cohen. - Please, come on in. - Hello, Lisa. - Hi, Mrs. Cohen. - Okay, we'll be coming back 11 a.m. Sunday. Now, there's plenty of food in the refrigerator and there's money on the counter in case you need anything and here are the house keys. - Kevin got a new toy, so he's up in his room playing. I'm sure he will be busy for the evening. - Right, huh. Kids. Gotta love 'em. - Okay, we're out of here. Okay, you call if you need anything. - I will. Bye, Stan, bye, Janet. - By, Lisa. Have fun in Germany or Deutschland. Or whatever. Kevin? Little brat. Yeah, well, they're gonna be back Sunday morning, so we gotta get this done before then. - Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, I hear you, I just ain't trying to roll out there that soon, you know? - Well, find a way to get here quick because we're running out of fucking time. - Excuse me? Who the fuck do you think you're talking to like that, huh? I ain't even about to hear this shit right now. - Oh, come on, baby. Don't you love me? Don't you want us to have nice things? - Yeah, yeah, you know I do, girl. - Hm, that's what I thought. Now, I've been babysitting this little fuck every weekend for three months just so we can do this. All right, this family is loaded. They have all their valuables stashed in a secret room downstairs and I have the key, okay? We sell what we get here and we'll be set for life, baby. - Yeah, yeah, that sounds good, huh. - Yeah, the jewelry collection alone has gotta be worth almost a mil. We sell that, we move to Mexico. I can be your little señorita. Serve you cocktails on the beach, wear those sexy outfits you like and. You little shit! - Yo, you there? Yo, baby, what was that? - Baby? Who the fuck you calling baby? - Yo, shut the fuck up! - Open the door, you little brat! You were gonna spy on me, huh? Planning on calling Mommy and Daddy, too? I have worked long and hard for this. I've earned this and if you think I'm gonna let a little shit like you stand in the way of that, you're dead wrong, you hear me? - I, I-- - You, you what? I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna sit here, in your room, for the entire weekend, until your parents get home. And then they're gonna come back and find everything in their precious mansion gone. Except for you. What would I want with you? You're just a stupid kid. Now go play with your stupid doll! Baby, you there? - Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, I'm here. What the fuck was that?! - Sorry, little kid was spying on me. But don't worry, I took care of it. ¶ Coming back with 17 ¶ - Now, be here around three in the morning, okay, all the neighbors should be asleep by then. I'll text you the address. - All right, peace. - I love you. Ugh! - What the fuck was that about? - Yo, I don't have time to deal with this shit right now, all right? I gotta go and so do you. - You gotta be fucking joking! How the fuck am I supposed to get home, Trey? - I don't think you'll have a hard time finding a ride. Just show 'em some skin. - You fucking asshole. Fuck you! - Get the fuck outta the car, all right? Peace, bitch! - I hope you fucking die! - Why can't you help me? Can't do anything. You're just a stupid doll. I'm too old to be playing with you anyway. "If trouble finds you, help will arrive. "Read these words and he will rise. "In the light, in the night, "rise of my will with all your might." Are, are you my friend? Are you gonna help me? - Made in England, 1895. Huh, jackpot! Shit! Little bastard! He better fucking be in his room. Where are you, you little shit? Are you trying to scare me? Why don't you come out so I can see you?! All right, you want to play games? Let's play. If you think I'm afraid to hurt you, you've got another thing coming, you hear me? You think I've never cut a kid before? Huh, that's nothing! I've cut kids and I will take great joy in cutting your fucking head off! Are you in there, you little creep? Kevin! Trey? Baby? Baby? No, no, no, no, no, no! I'm gonna kill you! You're dead, dead! Come out! Come out now! - Poor Lisa. Poor Lisa's boyfriend. They shouldn't have tried to steal from us. Can you get rid of them before Mom and Dad get home? - Kevin! Lisa! - We're home! - Oh! Whoa there, cowboy. - I just missed you, that's all. - Oh, we missed you, too. Where's Lisa? - She left with her boyfriend. They were gonna steal a bunch of stuff but he came over and they got into a fight and left. - Boyfriend? You've gotta be kidding me. The nerve of that girl! Well, she's never gonna work in this neighborhood again. - I'll say. - Yeah, the important thing is Kevin is all right. You're all right, aren't you, pal? Hey, did you get a chance to play with your new doll? - And the doll hasn't moved on its own since then. It's been very quiet since I got it and, lucky for both of us, I don't speak Hebrew. - You're telling me you believe that doll did all that? - It doesn't matter what I believe. It matters what the couple who sold it to me believe. What I related to is what their son told them when they took the doll away. He believed. And the question now is do you believe? - I believe all sorts of things. I have a very open mind but I don't know about that. - Well, an open mind is a wonderful thing to have. Don't ever lose it. - I'll try not to. - Good. So, you think your sister would like the doll? - Oh, I'm sure she would. But I don't know if I want to be responsible if he starts to wreak havoc again. That's perfectly understandable. So let's just keep looking until something catches your eye, shall we? - All right. What's this, Christmas special? Oh, no, but that suit is quite special, indeed. - Dare I ask where you got it? - Well, I have a friend who works at the morgue and sometimes he brings me things, things that come in with the bodies and this suit belonged to a particularly disturbed man, according to the police report that he read to me. - No, I don't think I'll ever get over it, quite frankly. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, that's great. That's great, good news. Well, why don't you get off your phone, go out and celebrate, huh? No, no, I'm, I'm on the wagon. But have a couple for me, all right. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, honey. How was your day? - Well, I made beef stew and pork chops but you missed that again. How was work? - Tom got the promotion. - What? - Yeah. - How'd you screw that up, Chris? You had seniority. - I don't know. I guess, sometimes, the best guy gets the job. - Well, with that kind of attitude, no wonder he got the promotion. When are you gonna stand up for yourself for once? If you don't, you're just gonna keep getting walked all over. - Yeah, yeah, you're probably right. You look beautiful, Susan. - Chris. - Come on, why don't you have a seat down here with me? I could really use a hug. - Let's just go to bed. Jesus Christ, Christopher. - Come on, honey. Don't you miss it? Don't you miss making love? - No, I don't miss it. And, no, I don't want to have sex with you now nor do I want to have sex with you any time soon. - I don't, what is the matter with you? Is it my weight? I mean, I quit smoking for you, I quit drinking. It's natural to put on a few pounds. - Yes. - It's not like I'm grotesque. - Yes, it's your weight, Chris. And if you were half as interested in getting a promotion at work as you were in gobbling down another Ho Ho, you might have had a chance of getting your bump up. - That's pretty damn harsh. - Well, maybe that's what you need. A harsh dose of reality. Goodnight. Don't forget to turn out the lights. - Good morning, Daddy. - Good morning, sweetheart. - Mommy says you're going to be late. - Oh, okay, I'm up. Thank you. Kissy? Have a great day. - You too. - You all ready, you got your books, folder? - Yep. - Okay. Okay, have a good day, okay? - Good morning. Is that cup for me? - Oh, this one has almond milk. There's some more in the pot. What time is the Christmas party tonight? - Oh, it's at six. Hey, where's the Santa suit? - It's right down there, in the bag. - And who's taking care of Crissy? - Colleen. She'll drop her back off tomorrow morning. - So we'll have the place to ourselves. - You're not gonna drink tonight, are you? - I've been dry for a full year now. - Yeah, well, I still remember last year. - Well, it's literally been 365 days, you know, let it go. All right, I gotta get dressed, I gotta get ready. I'll see ya tonight. Bye. - Bye. I'm telling you, Sam, Sunshine Industries is back in the saddle. We've been kicking ass and taking names, quite frankly. I just bought some more stock, in fact. Uh-huh. Well, yeah, we had some setbacks a while back, but, you know, we had the shortage of the blue sunshine but we ramped up production on that and the red sunshine, may I reiterate, there has never been any substantial test results that show any correlation between the use of red sunshine and all those suicides. - Chris? - And you can quote on me on that and I hope you will. Yeah. Look, uh, I really appreciate you doing the article on the company and I'm gonna send you over some product samples of the black sunshine. Yeah, God knows that makes you the life of the party in your bedroom, huh? Okay, that's on its way and I appreciate it, thanks. Talk to you soon. Yeah. Mr. Donaldson? - Chris, come on in. Hey, take a look at this. - Biacin? What, we run out of colors? - Just something the boys in the lab cooked up. It's for little old ladies with dementia. See if you can get someone at Ding Biscuits Monthly to write up an article about 'em. - And how are they? - Tell you what, I had one of 'em and a shot of Jack. Stared at static on the TV for three hours. Best time I've had since college. Well, I'll get started on the press kit right away, sir. - Yeah, one more thing. Sit down, Chris. You've been a great employee at this company for, what, now, nine years? - That's right, sir. - Well, I just want you to know that Sunshine really appreciates all the hard work you do. And I know you were expecting that promotion because you've got seniority. But Tom, he's got something that really represents what this company's about, he's a go-getter. He's a great leader. If I can see more of those qualities from you, then we can have this conversation again. But first, you've gotta show me you really know how to hack it. Speak of the devil, Tom! Hey, hidey ho! We were just talking about you. - Only good stuff, I hope? - Well, I was just explaining to Chris here about some of the qualities the company needs. - Yeah, well, I hope that I meet those qualities, sir. - Five years on the team and we're all the better for it. - Hey, you're still gonna be our St. Nick, right? - Sure thing. I've got the suit. - Yeah, well, we've gotta have our Santa. But let's try not to have a scene like last year. Behavior like that is not proper for the workplace. - Jesus, that was a riot. - I guess Rudolph wasn't the only one with a red nose that night, huh? - Well, gentlemen, I've got some work waiting for me, so, if you'll excuse me. - Okay. We still have 18 holes on Saturday? - You bet. And it's not gonna end like the last game. - We'll see. Hey, Chris, no hard feelings, right? - No, I'm fine, congrats. My pride might hold a grudge. ¶ And so it's Christmas ¶ ¶ Hear the festive music in the air ¶ ¶ See the smiling faces everywhere ¶ ¶ They stop and stare ¶ ¶ Another Christmas ¶ ¶ Time to celebrate ¶ - Santa. What are you gonna fill my stocking with? - Well, that depends, have you been naughty? - Oh, just a little. - Oh, well, I'll only put a little bit of coal in there. - No, Santa, I don't want any coal, I want something sweet. - Well, you seem sweet. I'll see what I can do. Oh, you are sweet. ¶ Have a happy Christmas and New Year ¶ ¶ Have a very Merry Christmas ¶ ¶ Christmas time is here ¶ ¶ Have a happy Christmas and New Year ¶ Yes! Oh, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Oh my goodness. Yeah, yeah, yeah. ¶ Have a very Merry Christmas ¶ - Ow, ow, ow, ow. It's a good ow, yes. - Oh, yeah, yes, yeah. Kind of burns, oh my God, in heaven, oh, yeah. - Double whiskey, neat. All right. Thanks, bud. - Again. Keep it. - Thanks, bud. - Hey. - Go again? From the gentleman at the end of the bar. Oh, yeah. Right? You're never right, no matter what you get her. Whatever you get her, you're fucking wrong. - I know, right? - So why don't you just give 'em cash and have 'em get their own fuckin' present, right? - Exactly. - Am I right? - Here, fuckin' cash. - Give us another one. Yeah. - Fuck, she can just take it all. - Tom got her some cock for Christmas. She seemed to like that. - What?! - She's a fuckin', god damn. - Cock, what the fuck? God, God. - Hey, you retire? - Come on, man, this is Santa Claus we're talking about here, he's got a whole fuckin' night. - I gotta busy night, I got shit I gotta get to, right? Whole fuckin' world, I need some energy, guys, damn it. Whole fuckin' world. Ah, to Santa. - I'm starting to get a runner's rhythm on this fuckin' shit, man. Right? You don't know her? Fuck you and fuck Cleveland! Yeah. - Hey! - What? - We're done, you're out. - Fine. - Get the fuck outta here. - And now I'm drunk? Fuck you. - You're fucking done. - Fuck you! - Get the fuck outta here. - There you go. Merry Christmas, cocksucker. - No! - God damn it. - Merry fucking Christmas. You haven't done shit. - Get the fuck outta here! We're fucking done! God damn it. - You motherfucker. You want to piss in my bar? I'll give you something to piss over. She loved his cock inside her. - No she didn't. She did not. - The fuck is wrong with you? - She did not. You're fucking dead. - Oh, yeah. We're going shopping. Are you just gonna let them run over you like that, big man? Or are you gonna do something about it? You're nothing but a two-pump chump. No wonder she doesn't want your tiny dick. They're gonna keep walking all over you unless you make them pay. - Mm-hm. - Barb? You got a great set of tits! Let's do this in proper fashion! One for my right nostril, one for my left nostril. Oh, I'm high on titty coke. - Well, thank God that's over with. Now I can have a real party in here. - Mm, so, does this mean I'll be working late tonight, sir? - Yeah, better tell whoever's at home not to wait up. - Mr. Donaldson. - Oh, I like that. - Oh my God. - That isn't appropriate office behavior, sir. Buzzkill, huh? That's no way to get ahead in this company! Hey. Let me ax you something-- - Chris, no. - Did I make the cut? You know, there seems to be a little disconnect between the two of us, huh? - No. - Some sort of problem. You know, maybe if we could have a little heart-to-heart, we could cut right to the meat of the matter, huh? If you got some sort of problem with me, we could bury the hatchet! - Ho, ho, ho! Sounds like someone's having a good time out there. Oh, oh! It gets you so high. Hey, you missed a spot there. Oh, God damn it, Barb, would you go get the door. ¶ And the truth you see ¶ - Hidey ho! You stole my job-- - No, no, no, Chris, Chris. - You had my wife. - Chris! Chris, take it easy, Chris! - I feel like I'm getting fucked with no lube today, Tom. - No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! - You nailed my wife and I think I'd better nail you, huh? - Oh my God, no! - 18 holes! Oh, by the way, golf is canceled tomorrow! Nighty night. No one can blame you. You had to show them. You're not their bitch. You had to stand up. Honey, I'm home. - Unbelievable. Chris! Chris! You're hammered! I can smell you from here. 365 days, huh? - It was a good run. - Where the fuck were you last night? - I went looking for you. Are you at least gonna be Santa for Crissy? - Christmas, yeah. Yeah, just give me a minute. - Where's the suit? - Bathroom? - What the hell? - Ho, ho, ho! - And shortly after that, he was seen wandering the streets in this suit, babbling incoherently and then he wandered right into traffic and was hit by a pickup truck, I believe. And so he was taken down to see my friend in the morgue. - Yeah, that is a pretty gruesome story. - Mm-hm. - Sounds right up my sister's alley. - Then you'll take it? - Yeah, I don't know, it just doesn't have that certain special something. - Really? - You know, maybe I came to the wrong place. - Oh, nonsense, you came to the right place, you just haven't found the right object. Come on, let's just keep looking. Perhaps we'll find something. I know we'll find something. - Okay, okay. No need to twist my arm. - Oh, okay, apologies. Well, we have a two-headed pig embryo over there. Might be a bit messy. We have an antique syringe kit here. Doctor's forceps. Down there is a desiccated bat. No? Well. Oh, this might work! A sword king. - Seems a little dangerous. - Oh, no. Weapons are only dangerous in the wrong hands. - No. I'm sorry, I just, nothing really strikes me as her. - All right. - What about that skull? That strikes me as her. - Hmm? The skull, no, no, you don't want to hear the story behind that. That is a beautiful ring. - Thank you. Where did you get it? - It was my mother's. - A family heirloom? I swear I've seen one just like it before. - Maybe. There aren't many like it. The story behind this one could put most of the items in here to shame. - Really? Color me intrigued. Please, do tell. - Isn't it getting a little late? - Oh, I have all night. - Well, my mother left it to me when she died. Ever since I was a little girl, she used to tell me I was a miracle. Amelia, a miracle. She used to say it all the time but she never told me why until I was much older. - Hm. May I help you? Ms. Mulvay? - Yes? - I'm Anna, we spoke on the phone about the room for rent. - Oh, yes, of course, please come in. You must forgive me, I didn't expect you so early. - Yeah, I took an earlier bus instead. - I see. May I help you with your bags? - Thanks. Was your trip pleasant? - Pleasant enough. - Wonderful. Well, I suppose you'd like to see the room. - That'd be great. - Right this way. Anna, is that short for anything? - Anastasia, but no one ever called me that except for my mother and she's dead. - Oh, I'm so sorry. My name is Lavinia, but you can call me Vinny. Everyone does. - Okay, Vinny. - My mother always called me by my full name too. I was named after my great-grandmother. Her daughter built this place, my grandma Jenny. - When was it built? - 1908, the first year her crops prospered. - She was a farmer? - Oh, yes, my whole family. The entire town, really. Without our crops, we'd have nothing. - Wow. - The room is right down the hall. Nothing fancy, but it's clean and it has a lovely view of the countryside. - I'm sure it's fine. It's perfect. - Good. And we're very isolated here, so you'll have plenty of peace and quiet. Are you a student? - No, not yet. I'm just looking for a job right now. - I see. - But don't worry. I have some money saved up. The ad said that rent was $50 a month. - Let's not worry about all that just now. What about your family, friends? - I don't have any friends around here yet and for my family, well, all I had left was my mother and she died a few months ago. Left me on my own for the first time and I just wanted to get as far away from that town as I could. So here I am. - Oh, I understand. Well, Anna, I have a good feeling about you. So, if you like the room, it's yours. - Yes, yes, thank you. - Not at all. Now, why don't I go down and bring up your bags. In the meantime, you just get settled in and make yourself at home. Oh, my husband Robert will be home at six if you'd like to join us for supper. - I'd love to. - Splendid. - So, Anna, where are you from? - New Haven. - Oh. Got some friends out in New Haven. Spent some time there myself. - Yeah, I've spent enough time there. I'm much happier here, believe me. - Looking for a fresh start in the country, eh? - Yeah, I guess you could say that. - Well, we're happy to have ya. Aren't we, dear? - Yes, we certainly are. - Does anyone else live here? Like, do you have any kids or anything? We haven't been blessed with children. - Yet. - Oh. I see. - It's just us. And you. - Would you like some more salad, dear? - Um, yeah, sure. I like your ring. - Thank you. It's very special to me. - Why is that? - Robert, Anna's looking for a new job. Do you know of anyone in town who's hiring? - Come to think of it, Ned Buckley down at the feed store, he had a help wanted sign in his window the other day. May be worth a visit tomorrow if you want to talk to him. - Thanks, I will. - I'd like to raise a toast. To Anna. Our new friend. And to happy beginnings. - Cheers to that. - Cheers. - Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. I was just coming to check on you. See if you need anything. - No, I was sleeping. I heard these voices outside and I saw fire. - Fire? You must have still been dreaming. Ain't no fire out there that I can see. - But listen, there's... - I don't hear nothin'. Maybe you ought to go back to bed. Looks like you could use the rest. - Yeah, maybe you're right. - And if you need anything, anything at all, just holler. - Sorry about that. Hello? Can I help you? - Hi, I'm Anna Thompson. I just moved into the Mulvay's house out on Willow Road. - Oh, well, hello there. Nice to make your acquaintance, young lady. Welcome to our little town. - Thanks. Doesn't seem many others around here are too happy to see me. - Don't mind them. They're just not used to seeing strangers in town. What can I do for you? - Robert said you might be looking to hire someone. - Yeah, that's right. My little girl, Shelley, she's going off to school soon and I'll need someone to take her place. Isn't that right, Shelley? You got any experience working in a place like this? - No, not really. But I'm a fast learner and a hard worker and I'll work whatever hours you need. - I don't know. Some of the other girls the Mulvays sent over here didn't work out so well. Shelley, what do you think? Don't mind her. She doesn't speak much these days. Used to talk too much for her own damn good. Tell you what. Come in here tomorrow morning, 7 a.m., we'll try you out, see how you do. - Sure, sounds good. - All right then. - Thanks. - I'm Ned, Ned Buckley. - Thanks, Ned. - I'll see you again real soon. - Sure will, bright and early. - Shelley, get back here, girl, we got work to do! - Hey, Shelley, what is it? You're hurting me. Shelley, get back here, girl, we got work to do. - So, did you enjoy your first trip to town? - Yeah, it's nice down there. Kinda quiet, though. You know, I was sorta surprised I didn't see any Christmas decorations or carolers. - I'm afraid Christmas isn't a very big holiday around these parts. - Guess not. But at least I have a job now. - Old Ned's a good man. I think you'll like working for him. - His daughter seemed kinda strange. - Yes, Shelley, oh, what a sad story. - There was something wrong with her tongue. - Rumor has it she chewed it right off herself. No one knows why. - But that doesn't make sense. Why would anyone do that? - Well, like you said, she's a strange girl. - Actually, everyone I saw today seemed kind of strange. - Are you all right, Anna? - Yeah, I'm just tired. Maybe I should go lay down. Stop, let go of me! - Hello, Anna. - What are you doing? What do you want from me? - You're going to help get Robert and I something we've always wanted - a child. - Put her on her knees. - No! - Oh, great goddess of the moon, we, your loyal servants, do call on you on this night. This night of the winter solstice. The night where your light shines longer than any other night. Where your power is greater than all other nights. We offer you this life, this soul, in exchange for a life of our own: the gift of fertility between my husband Robert and I so that we may have a child, at last. - You provided us with fertile crops and lands so that we may prosper. And for that, we are eternally thankful. But on this night, we ask that you grant us this blessing that we have wanted for so long. - Please, great goddess, accept this sacrifice as a symbol of our devotion to you so that we may have the gift of fertility and bring another devoted follower into your faithful town, who will obey your teachings always and never disobey or speak out against you. - The way others have. Please, don't. I won't tell anyone, I promise, please. - Your life may have been short, dear child, but your purpose was greater than you could have ever known. - Take her. - Oh, oh, thank you, great goddess, for this gift of life. Our child will make you proud. - And that's the last story she told me before she died. - So the sacrifice worked? - I'm standing here, aren't I? - Indeed you are. You know, your mother was-- - A monster? - That's not what I was going to say. I was going to say a powerful woman. - She was powerful. But I don't expect you to believe all that. - Don't be so sure. Like you, I also have an open mind. - But it's just a story, right? Made up by an old lady on her deathbed. - Just a story? Stories are the most powerful things we possess. We pass them on from generation to generation. They connect all races, all people. They live longer than we do. They transcend death. - Yeah, I suppose you're right. - I am right. Which is why I was... I'll have to have that ring for my collection. - I'm sorry, but I just couldn't part with it. - Oh, come on! We can barter! Anything, anything in this shop, it's yours. - No, really, thank you, but I couldn't. - Truly? All right. So. What'll it be then? What will your sister get for Christmas? Oh, it's almost midnight. - I'm really sorry, I just, I can't decide. - Wait a minute. I just remembered something that I've kept hidden away that I think will be perfect for your sister. - Really? - On my life! Here, I'll show you. I really think you'll be willing to give up that ring when I show you this. What's, what's, what's going on here? Who are you people? Get out of my shop, right now! - What were you going to do? Kill me for my ring, like you killed my sister? - Your sister? - Ophelia. My mother had twins. - I knew I recognized you. - I knew it was her the moment I saw it. And you killed her. For a ring. Just like all the others you killed for the things in this shop. When Sarah bought it, she brought it to me and I knew. I knew what you had done. We've been watching you. We've seen what you've down to all these people. - You don't understand. It is my duty to collect these items, to preserve them any way I can. What's one person when a story can be preserved? I did your sister a favor. She will live forever. - You're right. She is going to live on. A little trick my mother taught me for bringing back someone who was taken too soon. We just needed a little of your blood and a belonging of my sister's. We were going to use her ring, but her skull is so much better. - I should have killed you the moment you walked in here. - Yeah. You should have. Great goddess. Tonight, on the solstice, we offer you the blood of the man who killed Ophelia. We, your humble servants, make you this offering that you might bring her back to us to live once again. - Stop it, stop it! - Praise be, great goddess! Ophelia? You've come back to us. Mother said you wouldn't be quite the same. But I love you just as you are. And I brought you a present. - No. No! No, no, please, please! - Merry Christmas, Ophelia. No, no! No, no! ¶ Hear ye, hear ye the faith of the time ¶ ¶ Don't you know it's daylight time ¶ ¶ Can't you hear the noise of light ¶ ¶ Hear those boys and girls ¶ ¶ Listen to that big cow bell ¶ ¶ Everybody's going on a ride ¶ ¶ Hurry up, they hear them cry ¶ ¶ All aboard ¶ ¶ Come on, hear ye for that old sleigh ride ¶ ¶ Come on, hear ye ¶ ¶ Come on, everybody, make a lot of noise ¶ ¶ Hear the sleigh bells ring ¶ ¶ Everybody, everybody off ¶ ¶ Now everyone, together ¶ ¶ Everybody's happy by the tree ¶ ¶ On a good old sleigh ride ¶
