-Good work! -Goodbye. She's coming. There's no turning back. Are you ready? All set. Hey. Maybe we just need to ask nicely. I mean, maybe we're taking this too far. What's going to happen to us if we go through with this? -Hey-- -Stop whining! Let's do this. Cunni! Cowper. I missed because of you. Call me if you're in town. Why should I bother? Welcome home, Cunni. I haven't been called that in a while. It's been four years. CITY HALL -I bought a bikini. -Really? I couldn't wait anymore. Being proactive. -It was cute. -Very cute. -Already? -Yes. -I know! -What? Let's go to the beach. -We should have a barbecue. -I love that! -Let's all go together! -Let's go! Yoshimura, come with us to the beach. Hey. The beach? I don't think I can. What? Are you too busy? See? Yoshimura always blows us off. Too bad. You look like you're in shape. What? I bet you have muscles. Wow! Very impressive. How about your pecs? Hey! Don't touch me! It's just... I don't like to be touched. Hey! Nipple! Is it good? Nipples? Hey. Stop calling me that at work, Cunni! I will if you stop. Let's just keep it between us. Shut up. I'm sorry. Cunni, what brings you home? I have a family thing. Can you stay? No. It's complicated. I have to go back to Tokyo soon. Are you busy? It's insane. I had to bail on my gig and stuff. Wow. You're really busy. Welcome. By the way... Have you done it? Me... Not yet. Nipple? Honestly... Wait. No progress. Damn it. How about you? Well, I could've if I wanted to. So, you didn't do it? I wasn't feeling it. You scared me for a second. You got me too, man. You were like, "Honestly..." Asshole. Give me your money. Come here. Give me your money. Hurry up! What the... Really? Give me your money! Hurry up! -Hey! The money! -Let's go for a drink. Yes. I know a place. Let's go. -What? -Come on. Give me your money! Give it to me! Hey! What's wrong with you? So you do have money, you little shit. -Why didn't you give it up? -Sorry! Hey! I'm asking you! Answer me! Why did you lie to me? Hey! Answer me! Tell me. What's your fucking reason? -What is it? Why did you lie to me? -Cowper! -Give it to me. -Hurry up. Talk to me. Say something! -Why aren't you talking? -I'm sorry. -Hey. -Help me! Stop running! -Stop talking! -Help me! -He's too loud. -Help me! -But... -Help... Hey. -Don't run from me! -Have you ever licked a woman down there? -Come here! -Help me! -I have. -Help me! Don't underestimate me! -Oh, wow. -Help... That's awesome. TAMAHAN Our next gig is at Eggman. You know that place, right? No. Know your basics, man. Lots of great musicians started out there. Recently, MWAM and Miwa. Miwa? She's amazing. We got discovered, too. But the big ones only want me. Wow. My band members disapprove. -A dispute? -Yes. -Welcome! -Welcome! That's amazing. You're our star, Cunni. You've found your passion and drive. Do you remember the others? They're pretty hot. -It's crazy. -We should go next time. No gawking! You're right. They're top-notch. They keep looking at us. They're into you. Go talk to them. -Too much work. -That's crazy. Hey, look. That guy is staring at us. -Shall we? -Yes! -What about him? -Stop that! -Go, Mai. -I can't! -Shoot! They're coming over. -Let's go. Don't do this to me. I want to drink with just us three. They're coming. No nicknames. Of course, Kunimori. I won't talk. Shut up. -Hi, guys. -Hello. Do you need something? What? I was just reading the menu. -What? You're lying! -I know! He's lying. Now that you're here, join us. Join us. So? What do we do? This guy is from Tokyo. -Really? -Really? I do music. What? Do you have any albums? Not yet. I see. It's an indie band. -Wow. -I write music. You do? That's cool. Who's music? For Miwa. -Miwa? -Sometimes. -Hey! -That's amazing! Hey! Is that you, Nipple? Word up! Hey! What's up? Putin. Long time no see. What's your name again? What? It's Kunimori. Kunimori? Oh, Cunni! Shinichi Kunimori. I forgot about you, Cunni. What? It sounds dirty. Is that your name? I don't know. -Nipple! -Yes! Don't flirt with chicks in front of me. No, this is nothing like that. Why do they call you Nipple? What? -Do you want to know? -Yes. -Nipple! -Yes! Take your shirt off. What's going on? Take your shirt off! Pasties? Take them off! Pasties off, now! Wow, they're huge! And dark! That's a mother's teat. He can shoot beams out of those! Good one! He played with them too much and this is what happened. Cracks me up every time. I can't breathe. So... Have you schmucks had sex yet? What? I don't know. What? Seriously? These guys are 25 and still virgins. Not everyone, right? What? What about you? I don't know. You moved to Tokyo, but you're a virgin? That's sad. What were you doing in Tokyo anyway? Nothing, right? Losers are losers wherever they go. So everyone is a virgin? Hey. It's not like I couldn't do it. What? That was brutal. I never want to be with girls like that. I can't be pressured into it. You don't call that sex. Then what is? What? You need to go through all the steps. That's just an excuse. We can't have sex because we're wimps. Wimps? It's so disappointing. I thought 25-year-olds were grown-ups. I... I'm turning 26 next week. Stop it, Cowper. I'll kill you. Sorry. Maybe we're better off dead. I want to have sex. I wonder how it feels. Yes. Cowper, aim over here. What are you doing? Hurry. I'm running out. Lower! We did it! One stream! We're brothers now. Brothers? We are brothers! Virgin brothers! We can do it! -Yes! -Yes! We're getting laid! -Yes! -Yes! Cowper, yours is pretty big. For a fat guy. -Shut up. -Don't aim at me! -My bad. -Idiot. KUNIMORI LIQUOR STORE I'm home. Oh, my! I'm glad you're home. Good boy. Was it cold out? Not really. You'll catch a cold wearing those clothes. -Your hair is a mess. Do something. -Don't touch me. I was worried because it was late. You won't pick up the phone. -Your dad's waiting. -All right. He is in his room. What, Shinichi? Why did you come back after all this time? Shut up. How bad are you? It's nothing rest can't cure, but I can't close the store. You have no idea how busy I am. What? Busy with what? What? With the band. Are you serious? How is music going to support you? You don't even send money. Tell me what you want to eat! Okay! Fucking annoying.

But wait for it... You feel so good. You like that? That feels so good! Yes! Wait, what? She loves it! She's very naughty. No, this is just porn. That's how it is. I thought she didn't want to. It's all good once you get it in. Girls are dirty. I can't believe them. So what's your point? Just hear me out. What I'm about to say is seriously evil. But if we don't do it, we're losers for life. What? We have one mission. Rape. We will rape one girl and lose our virginity together. Wait! It's not like porn! What? I'm sorry, but I'm out. What? Are you scared? Too lazy? No money? Not cut out for it? Your parents will scold you? You don't like it? You've never done it? Pathetic? Lame? You're full of it. You're 25 years old. But you still want to have sex? Dumbass. You're right. Raping is the worst. But I thought about it. What if our target is the town's biggest slut who's thirsty for a cock? What? Target? Fueko Shaku, AKA... Fella-ko! One man! One song! One shot! Who will defeat Fella-ko tonight? Word up! -Word! -Word! Fellatio Fight! -I'm going to win! -I just jerked off! I won't lose. -Come on! -Let's do it! -Come on.

The lyrics haven't started yet! The season of light blue Watching starlight, starlight Matsuoka loses! He lost it in the first chorus. I'll go next! Next up, Yamagata's "Mad Dog," Takebe! Did he choose a wild song as a strategy for distraction? It's time for our captain's battle. -Yes! -Yes! Will contender Putin defeat Fella-ko? I'll put an end to her winning streak. Putin, we wish you the best of luck. On to our next song... Fellatio Fight! You're right. She won't turn us in but thank us instead. Plus, she worked at a sex joint in Tokyo. Wait. We can't choose our first mate like that. What? You want a virgin? Well, yes. Virgins donâ€™t exist anymore. Not in this country. -They do! -No, they don't! But are you sure we can do this? I have a plan. Thanks for the business. Thank you. Shit, she wiped us out. I'll pay you 30,000 yen if you let me bang you. What? No way. What about 50,000? Say yes! Stop. Let's bounce. My bad. Hey! Let me screw you, Fella-ko! BUS STOP Hey, Goki. -Move. -What? You know, Fueko. People are like... vegetables. What? What? Vegetables? Me... I'm a broccoli. Okay. Then what am I? You? A leek. What? A leek? Here. I bought too much. He said I'm a leek. Silly. Right? He comes way too often. He does. His teeth are perfect now. No more to fix. -Rest up. -I will. -See you. -Goodbye. SHAKU What are you doing? You forgot your change. I owe you 189 yen. I'm from the liquor shop. Oh, right. I wanted to deliver your change. You deliver small changes, too? You're damn right, I do. Beer tastes best from the bottle, right? Oh, do you want it delivered? What? You can do that? Then count me in. Sure. It's my job. Thanks. I'll get it delivered to you. Sure. Get it gift wrapped. Okay. So I think it's time to execute our plan. Rape Fella-ko... No, stupid. It's too early. We have many quests to conquer first. Look. THE ROAD TO RAPE Stealing panties, flashing, groping... Hey, Cunni. What are you making us do? What? Yes, I do want to touch a girl. I'm interested in groping, too. But I don't want panties or to show off my penis. -Me neither. -This is a rite of passage. We just want to lose our virginity. Not become a sex crime expert! -Cowper! Calm down! -Calm down. I'll kill you for real. I'm sorry. Is that Goki? I heard he raped someone last week. Seriously? I heard he was in jail. I heard he killed four Chinese people. What? I know, we should go talk to him. No way. He'll kill us. We can learn how to rape, from the best. -What? -Shut up. What do you want? Don't piss your pants. So dangerous. Here's a club. Be careful. Wow. Let's start with this. Go hard. Don't hold back. All right. Ready, Cunni? Wait. Your wallet. What? Who cares. Feeling the pain is the point. Fine. Okay, come! Okay. -Ready? -Yes. Open your eyes and feel the pain. My eyes! -Give me water! -Are you okay? It works like a charm! Ready, Nipple? Hold on. I think I'm going to pass. It's too much trouble. What? Stop playing it cool. It's not that I'm playing cool. If this is what it takes, I'd rather stay a virgin. Asshole. Do you think being a virgin is cool? No, I don't. You stupid poser. I bet you think you can get laid anytime you want, right? -What? -Whatever. What a downer. Fine, I'll do it! Ready, Nipple? Come on, Nipple! I won't die from a taser! I won't die! Nipple? Nipple! -Hey! Nipple! -Hey! -What now? -Shit! -Hey! -Wake up! Wake up! Don't... Man... It was powerful for a self-defense weapon. Right? Cunni... Yours was the most harmless. Not true. My ass is throbbing. Nipple's heart stopped. What do you want me to do? Hey. I don't think being a virgin is cool. Okay. Why are we trying so hard? Hurting ourselves like this. Quit if you want. Just know you'll be a loser for life. I'm sorry. Time for work. Later. I bet Cunni has no female friends. You don't either. Right? Don't tell Cunni. Let me meet her. I won't tell Cunni. But... PUTIN Hey! Get in. Hello. -Who is this? -Shut up! Don't talk. Yes? Delivery from Kunimori Liquor Store. You really came. Here it is. Okay. Can you put it down here? All right. Thanks. Sure. Thank you for your business. Hey. Wait. Yes? I got a lot of potatoes, and I made too much stew. I see. So you live in Tokyo. Yes. Don't look too closely. It's messy. Right. I can't resist buying those. My dream is to become a certified care worker. I need my strength to take care of people, that's why. I see. I did build a lot of muscles though. Here. Thanks for waiting. You're going to eat it now? Just a taste. Oh, sure. Wait for a second. Here. Thank you. Enjoy. Do you like it? I'm glad. Look at those nipples. They're huge! Hey, lick it for him. No way! They're disgusting. -Why not? Come on! -No way! -Just do it. -No way! No! He's super sensitive! Paako, this guy is a virgin. Let's all do it together and make him a man today. What? -A threesome? -Yes. You said you wanted to try. There's no way I'm doing a threesome! What? What about me? What? He looks way too happy! It's his first time, too. That's messed up. He doesn't care how. Strip. -He's a virgin after all. -Wait. No. Wait... I'm not ready. -Right now? -Don't worry about it. You've got a banging body. Putin. No, Putin. Putin. Hey, watch closely. This is how you pleasure a woman. No, don't... Stop... I can't... I want to put it in. -Hey! -Yes! Underwear, off. What? Wait, but... What? Don't play it cool. Now! Yes! All right, Paako. Go! It's time for you to become a man. What the hell? Nipple! What? Cunni? It's me. What's up? Listen. For the first time, I stood up to Putin.

I can take you home. You'll catch a cold if you stay here. Goki! Fueko. Do you want to see something special? Wow! It stopped raining. Goki, it stopped raining. We outran the rain. Shit! He won't pick up. Why did you bring him along last time? -He's such a creep. -What? Because he's entertaining. All we ever do is fuck. Wait. What does that mean? Let's break up. You're too much work. What? You just came inside me. I don't get it! Listen. I'm way out of your league. Get out! I'm done with you. Get out! Hey! Don't follow me, you stalker. No! I'm not breaking up with you! We're not over! I'm not a stalker. Do you want to come in and eat some stew? -Stew? -Yes. I made it with the potatoes you gave me. -Here. -No, thanks. I'm too wet. All right. Hey. What's up? Here. How was it? It was very... Sorry. What? Hey. Here. I have a towel for you. Thank you. I have to go. Okay. See you later. Oh, right! My birthday is coming up! What? All right! She's too cute! I want to do it. No... I don't want to. Putin. Hey. I was thinking... I want to stop doing Fellatio Fight for a while. I mean, I really want to keep doing it. But... Fella-ko. Fueko. What? Be my woman. Is that what you wanted to talk about? I'm going home. Hey! I'm asking you out! The man everyone knows in town. Who cares? Wait! Is there someone you like? Well... Who is it? Goki. What?

Fella-ko! You jerk, asking me out, then getting a hand job? No, this is not... No, wait! Fella-ko! We're here. ITSUKI METALS Cunni, we should turn back. It's too late now. Why? He's a serial rapist, a scumbag! Then we don't need to see him. Did something happen? Nothing happened! But I want to talk to him. Leave, if you want to. Okay then. What? -But... -Let's go. But you said I could leave. Is he there? -Do you see him? -Stop freaking out! Excuse me. Excuse me. What? Say something, Cunni. Well... Are you dating Fueko? What? All right. So juvenile. No. We're not. Then what is she to you? Nothing, really. Okay, then. No, Cunni. You're asking the wrong questions. Come on, Nipple. Your turn. Goki, we would like to ask you a question. What? Make it fast. How do you rape someone? Oh, no... What do you mean? Well... We want a man with experience to tell us how to rape someone. Rape is a crime. Yes. That is true, but... You are a serial rapist, I presume. Who? You, Goki. I always have consent. What? Are you trying to rape someone? Idiots. Let's go! Putin. That's what you get! No one beats me in this town! Word! You tough bastard! Do it! He's shaking like a vibrator. Hand it over. Hey! Is that you, Nipple? What are you looking at? Wait, you fuckers! Hey! Wait! Why did you do that? Asshole! It was Nipple!

Show them your blow job techniques. Goki! What happened to you? Fueko, this guy's an alien. I just beat him up for the greater good. You sound ridiculous! That man is a psycho. Oh, god! What the hell? Let go! What the fuck, man? Take this! Damn, you've got a hard head. Take this! That hurts! That hurts! No! No! Hey! That hurts! That's enough! Goki! Stop! Goki! You're going to kill him! Forgive me. Please... It hurts... It's okay now. Come on out. It hurts so bad... Hey. What happened here? I don't know. Goki, where are you going? Shower. You should go to a hospital. I brought some stew for you. It should help you get better. We got interrupted. Don't rape anyone. You'll end up like him. We live in a shitty world. Think about what's important to you. Figure it out. There's no reason to rape anymore. KUNIMORI LIQUOR STORE Shinichi, how is your dad doing? Not too good. Is that so?

Please gather in the other room. -Over there? -Yes. -The far right. -Okay. Cunni. It's been a while. It's going to be tough for you. I guess. What about your band? I don't know. I'm the heart of the band. I mean, it's not the end, right? Right. You can start a band here, -post your music online. -Shut up. I don't want to hear it. Take advantage of being a virgin and make songs for the loners. Brilliant! You'll get popular and girls will come to you. Then you can hook us up. We'll have sex all the time. You don't get it. Sorry. I guess you can't think about the band right now. I'm not in a band. What? I've never been in a band. What? What? You suckers, I was just joking. Seriously? You got me. Jokers. Of course. Bands are for people who are living the life. I mean, who says I have to do something big just because I move to Tokyo? Don't put your hopes on me. Honestly, I haven't done shit! Here. Thanks. It was nasty. Real nasty. All right. It's rape time. What? Are you ready? It's about time. I'll get my car. Hurry up, then. Thank you for coming today. Here. It was delivered to me. Are you sure? You know how bad this is. What we're about to do is absolutely evil. There's no excuse. You'll have to live with it. But if we don't, we're losers for life. Am I right, Cunni? We're scumbags, right? Let's go. I had a weird dream last night. You're talking about this now? Now is the perfect time. When I woke up in my dream, I was the actress, Haruka Ayase. So what? What? Doesn't that turn you on? I woke up in a woman's body. In Haruka Ayase's body! Yes, that is pretty hot. Right, Nipple? What do you think I did next? You played with your boobs? Wrong! That's not it. I went to see the two of you, and then I took my clothes off. What? Then you guys said, "We're sorry, but thank you!" And you both kneel in front of me. And then? And then... I... No, Haruka Ayase said, "Please don't apologize. I'm just a plain girl, but please take me." That's what she said. Then I woke up. What? That's it? Yes. But isn't it hot? That's an ideal dating scenario. Ideal? Cunni. Let's stop talking about this. You're right. -Good work! -Goodbye. She's coming. There's no turning back. Are you ready? All set. Hey. Maybe we just need to ask nicely. I mean, maybe we're taking this too far. What's going to happen to us if we go through with this? -Hey-- -Stop whining! Let's do this. What? What? Who are you? Do exactly as I say. What? This gun shoots 18 rounds per second. It will stop your breath with pain. You can avoid the same fate. Do it. What? -What? -Take her down! Come! What? What? She's awake! One more time! Come on, man! I have no choice. Cunni! Nipple? Die! Oh, god! That hurts! Stop! -We're very sorry. -We're very sorry. Sorry is not enough, assholes! You want to use force to get a woman? Scumbags! Where's your empathy? Shame on you! First of all, take off your masks. -Yes. -Yes. Go on. You too. What? You're such a creep. A creep? Who's the creep? What? You're the creep, you slut. There's no one less creepy than me. What? What is he saying? I've kept my virginity all these years because I'm not a creep. You creeps can't keep it in your pants. You're too easy. We don't have sex on impulse! Calm down. What do you mean, "I'm here for you"? And your stupid stew. How can you say stuff like that? Explain it to me. What's wrong with that? You made me fall for you! Who do you think you are? If you ever play with our hearts again, I'm going to kill you! I'm not kidding! We're Adams! But you're no Eve. You're a snake! A freaking snake! -Say something, snake! -Hey... -She's a snake! A snake woman! -What's going on with you? Hey. How's that for an explanation? -Did you get it? I'm asking you! -Cunni! So? What do you want? So let me have sex with you! What? If we don't have sex now, we're losers for life! That's why I'm giving a slutty bitch like you a chance to save us. So... You want to have sex with me? That's what I'm saying! Sorry, no way. Miss Fueko. I beg you. Please save us from this misery. Especially this guy... He's never done cunnilingus, but he's been nicknamed Cunni forever. Please! Well... He's a self-centered liar and a scumbag, but he has a sweet soul. I beg you! I'll pay whatever you ask for. Please! Yesterday, his old man died. So, please. I'm asking you. Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please! -Please!
