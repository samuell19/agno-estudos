WEBDRAMARURKEY SUB TEAM (Ham Radio Beginner's Guide) CQCQCQ, can anyone hear me? Translate : Seonbae & Rose parks Fixing : AĞAOĞLU (Yeo Jingu) (Cho Yihyun) (Kim Hyeyoon Na Inwoo, Bae Inhyuk) (Written and directed by Seo Eunyoung) Please respond, CQCQ. (Ditto) The new semester of 1999... (1999 Spring) A nuclear explosion will wipe out humanity! Yong! Kim Yong, wait for me! Eunsung is in a cast? He annoyed me, so I pushed him away. Who will fill in for him in the basketball tournament? I guess I have to do it. Dropouts can't play. What? You said you would drop out to pursue your dreams. Aren't you here to drop out? I was drunk. Don't take it seriously. I knew it. Great job man, School of Engineering will be good for your future. Oh, we have 17 new female students. Don't lie to me. It is the truth. Even the top student of the entire school is a girl. That is really something. You are right. But I don't know if she exists. She registered, but she didn't show up for orientation. The professor is really worried. Someone should bring her to the meetup tonight. Huh? She is an important asset to our department. We should make sure she stays here. But someone injured the student council president. Who was it again? We need someone else to fill his shoes. What is her name? Hansol! Seo Hansol! Seo Hansol? Yeah! (Engineering Building 3) Does she still use a pager? Hello, Ms. Seo Hansol. I am a junior. My name is Kim Yong. Welcome to the department of mechanical engineering. Please come to the meetup at 6 p.m., held at Jinmi Bar. By the way... Ms. Hansol. Everyone is worried because no one can reach you. I would like to escort you safely to the meeting place myself. It would be best if you ask questions about university life. I am a kind person, so feel free to ask. I am not a bad person at all. Please leave me a message! Hey there. Why are you already at school? Today is an important day. Don't talk about dying. You should live and study. Yo! Hey. Mansu broke up? How did you know? His face tells it all. Cheer up, Park Mansu. Let's play Starcraft before the meetup. You can take Kim Eunsung's place. I am busy. Why? Because I am. Hey... Are you... Dating someone? I am hearing things now. Is dating all you think about? Why are you suddenly talking about dating? It is not like that. Go back to sleep. People who deny dating start dating soon. Good morning, sir. Time for a roll call... Should we take a quiz today? It is an openbook quiz. Hello, I am Seo Hansol. You must be in class. I would like to ask you a favor before the meetup. (Student Council Building) I will wait outside the student council building. I am wearing a crossbody bag and a pink shirt. Are you... Yes, I am Seo Han... I am Seo Hansol. I see... You are getting a call. What? Call. Oh... Hello? It is your best friend. This number is... Bring me a comic book... No longer in service. Hey! Hiya, nice to meet you. Hiya. Do you have a favor to ask me? I want to join a club, but I missed orientation. Could you show me around campus? Oh, of course! Let's go. Go, go! This is not for you, right? I won't die, no matter what. Die, die, die! Die, die! Die, die! Let's leave. We only meet at night. Stars are out during the day, too. (Astronomy Club) But they are too close to see. It is because the sun is too bright. Right? Oh, a Ham radio! Are you interested? I have always wanted to try it. Just like Kim Eunsung. Huh? It is nothing. Ow, static. Static. Jinx! Unjinx. Is anyone into Ham radios in our department? There must be someone in the School of Engineering. What if there is? I would like to learn from them. Is there anyone? No, of course not. Everyone is too busy studying. Freshmen are already using the library. It is a crazy world. And apparently, the world will end on December 31st. Getting a job is still difficult. College seniors... The cafeteria serves delicious food. Black bean noodles and... Japchae rice. They are extra good. Why are they here? Why would they choose such a difficult path? I have a question. What can we do after graduation? Well, let's see... Something to do with machines. Anyways, congrats on getting in! Thank you! Cheers! Cheers! You are really drunk. You are the top of the entire school? You are so dumb. Why did you choose this department, out of all the others? Because I was interested. Don't lie, no one is interested in mechanical engineering. You are a funny one. Did you know that there are three types of people? First, men. Second, women. Third... Women in the engineering field! Hey, let's go get ice cream. Why would I go get ice cream with you? Kim Yong! Act like a proper junior. Treat us properly, or we will haze you. Hey, you can't haze freshmen anymore. You might get arrested. There is no hazing. What the heck are you talking about? Am I a criminal? Tell me, am I a criminal? This is too lame to watch. What did you say? Lame? You are so rude. Freshmen, get up. Get up! This is why engineering students are called OFFs. I hate that nickname. Obnoxious, foolish... Faggot. Faggot. Faggot? Calm down. Faggot? Let me go! She called me a faggot! I need to go. My dorm has a curfew. Why is it so quiet? Hey, I am the Teaching Assistance. Hello. Hi. What is wrong? Nothing. Wow... Did someone scold you? Let's catch up later. You are playing basketball in Eunsung's place. Okay. Hi. I am the Teaching Assistance. Does that make you uncomfortable? What took you so long? I was scared. Let's hurry. Okay, I should have come out sooner. What if I made you unpopular, too? I am already unpopular. Seniors hate people like me. Why not? I like your type. Really? Me, too. Why do you keep smiling? Oh, am I smiling? That is my dorm. That was fast. I will go in. Okay, bye. Yong... Yeah, I am here. There is a lunar eclipse tonight. Oh, really? Hansol... Will you... Have lunch with me tomorrow? Who is going to buy that meal? Reflection! Automatic reflection! Rainbow reflection! I mean... Of course, lunch is on me! Freshmen should not take out their wallets. See you tomorrow. Okay. Are you for real? You should not seduce a freshman. Can't freshmen date? They should not date you. Okay, it is 20. What is wrong with me? No point. 30! Eunsung, do you still have Ham? It is not something you eat. I need to borrow it. Don't ask me why. Selling it won't get you much money. Is it in your dorm room? My locker. Can you even use it? A little. I have seen you use it. I will borrow it. Whatever. I am off. Hey, how is Mokman? He is fine, so just get out of the hospital. People think I injured you. It was your fault. You saved him instead of me. A turtle startled you so much, you fell down the stairs. Anyways, take good care of him. They like lettuce too. Bye. Oh, right. Hansol says there is a lunar eclipse tonight. Bye! At least he will stay in school. Mokman, I am home. Why is this so heavy? Mokman... Mokman... Mokman. I met someone amazing today. I will celebrate just a little bit. Hansol... Are you looking at the same thing right now? What a terrible thing, darling Just imagining becoming a grownup Brings me so much pain Ooh, help me Please understand I like you And my love, I love you But I can't make up my mind Maybe a guy who will prepare special events for you Might be better for you Sometimes, I want a day off Ooh, ooh Oh my love You won't leave me alone But when I am by myself Everyone, the end is nigh! The apocalypse is coming! A nuclear explosion will wipe out humanity! The world will end someday, right? It can't end now. I have not even dated a girl properly yet. That is surprising. You seem like the popular type. I... Have high standards. (Government Worker Exam Notice) I will be a senior next year. Maybe we will be better off with the apocalypse. The IMF crisis has everyone on edge. It is like we are cursed. My dad's factory shut down because of the IMF crisis. My dad told me... 'Hansol, get employed at a big corporation.' 'That is the road to success.' But those big corporations ruined my dad's business. I am really interested in mechanical engineering. This school is investing a lot in robotics. I want to build a manufacturing system for small factories like my father's. Small changes could improve efficiency. But people are scared of change. I want to help them. So they don't go out of business, like my dad. Why are you silent? Is my dream too unrealistic? No, it is just that... You are so confident in your dreams. What about you? Is there anything you want to do? Kissing you. What did I just say? Hansol, it is not that... Don't misunderstand. The end is nigh! Everyone, the end is nigh! The end is nigh... What are you doing? Hey, what took you so long? Hansol, I made plans with my friend. I need to go, bye. Let's go. Ouch, my leg! Slow down! Is that her? Yeah. Hurry up. My leg has not healed yet! Why did I mention kissing? Die, Kim Yong! Just die! Mokman... What should I do now? Damn it... Can anyone hear me? Hello? Yes, I can hear you. Wow, it really works. Is this your first time using a Ham radio? Yes. I think we have to introduce ourselves first. That is what it says in this book, too. What book? Ham radio Beginner's Guide. Do you have a book like that? My parents hoard all kinds of things. I see. My name is Kim Yong. A student of Hanguk University. OMG, I go to Hanguk University too. Pardon? OM.. what? I am a sociology major. My name is Kim Munee. I need to interview a stranger for an assignment. But I did not think this would actually work. Oh... I will help you with your assignment if you lend me your book. Really? I would be so thankful. I would like to ask you something, too. What is it? I would like to ask in person. Let's meet tomorrow, at the pay phone in front of the student council building. Do you mean the old building? Okay, what time? Um, at noon! Yes! Mokman? Mokman... Translate : Seonbae & Rose parks Fixing : AĞAOĞLU Youngji... This is the student council building, right? Yeah, the old one. Your makeup is running. I guess it is not waterproof. It is suddenly raining. Don't I look like a movie character? You will catch a cold. Nice umbrella. This is so annoying. Do you want some ramyun? Are you going to treat me? Let's go. The weather is so weird. Why did not he come? He could not be bothered. Look up. Because of the rain, right? All better. You did a clean job. Let's eat. Isn't it amazing that we go to the same university? I don't believe in fate, but it felt strange. Me, too. It is so hard to believe. I don't believe in fate. If fate exists, my future will be bleak no matter what. I don't want to think about it. Why do you think that way? I have student loans, living expenses, and debt. My youth is hopeless. I have had a different start from others. Still, we are all on different paths. Youngji, we studied hard to come to the same university. If you just hang in there... Never mind. I should not tell you how to live your life. I am crossing a line, right? You crossed that line a long time ago. What? Friends can say things like that to each other. Right, friends. Yeah, we are such close friends. Munee, I have to go. I can't miss another group meeting. You should hurry, then. You have a fever. Take cold medicine before you sleep. I know you will be fine on your own. You did not even show up. That is my line. Is this voice phishing? Voice what? You are so... Come on. Don't cough into the mic. Mind your manners. I waited two hours in the rain for you. Just apologize. Why are you lying? Did it rain today? It was hot as heck! Damn it, I can't believe you were accepted to Hanguk University. It is still raining, can't you hear it? Is that sizzling meat? Meat? You are a tween, aren't you? What? Huh? Hello? What is wrong with this? Did I scare him off? What the hell! It is not raining at all. What does tween mean? Is it some kind of food? It is not raining at all. (Kim Young is Liar) I worked hard without causing problems. I can't believe I am getting fired. I have worked here for 20 years. You are the first person to come see me. I am grateful for this experience. Soon, he must leave our university. The school informed him that they would not renew his contract. The same goes for the cafeteria workers. Contract workers face a serious problem. It must be solved on a fundamental level. That was our presentation. Thank you. Good job. I liked the content. Next, Kim Munee? Yes. You did not hand in your presentation plans. Did you decide on an interviewee? Well... Not yet. You are flying solo, make it hurry. That is it for today. Thank you, professor. Want something tasty? You have read my mind. Not showing up is so rude. Don't interview someone like him. Let's eat. Let's enjoy the food! Should I drop the class? No, just interview a passerby. That is so boring. What about the owner of this place? It is too much. What is wrong? What is happening? It is your friend in the Korean department. Not friends, right? Guess not. I am talking about you two. It is not like that. I wish I could erase my memories of you I am crossing the basketball court to be with you The left hand slightly helps out! Hey, do you know what tween means? Is it some kind of food? Shoot. Hi, going home? We are going to the library. Freshmen can't use the library. Oh, really? Goodbye, I will let you go now Kim Yong, where are you going? I have a quiz to study for. Aren't you going to practice basketball? The quiz is not important! Basketball is not that important. See you tomorrow. Bye. (Raising Turtles) (Ramyun) So, you have been avoiding her? Escaping reality works sometimes. She must be disappointed. She probably didn't have high expectations, anyway. I have decided. I will ask her to be my girlfriend. I will meet her gaze... What? I can't just kiss her. Of course, you can't. Want to be my girlfriend? Are you insane? You are rushing. They say when you are in a rush, slow down. No, I need to rush. You are crazy. You have seen Hansol. Of course, I am crazy! I guess she is cute. Hey... She is mine, so don't try anything. Interested in school now? What did you say? You are an idiot. Hey, what are you doing? Oh, hello. What are you up to? I was supposed to meet someone, but I guess we missed each other. Then, try the pay phone. You might find something. (Jungmin, Let's meet at the gates at 2 p.m. (Come to the basketball court.) (English Majors, Stay strong!) (Suyeon, I waited for you here.) I was harsh last time, but I really waited for 2 hours. I waited for over 2 hours as well. How strange. Do you want to use a messaging app? What? What is an app? OMG... Don't you have a smartphone? Why are you keep saying 'OMG'? You have never even heard it before? No. I have never heard it in my life. How is this possible? When did you enroll in university? In 1995. In 1995? I enrolled in 2021. 2021? Mokman, this girl is a weirdo. You are telling me you started university in 1995? That is right. You have been at school for over 20 years? Over 20 years? It is 1999 right now. What are you saying? 1999? Stop playing around. That is my line. You are the one who is lying. Give me your cell phone number. You know what a cell phone is, right? Write this down. 0185190813! What the...? A 018 number? This number does not exist. Please try again. Let's do this, then. Let's meet at the payphone tomorrow at noon. If you don't see me after 30 minutes, leave a message on the left pillar of the payphone. Let's meet at 8 p.m. Sure thing. Kim Yong... The left pillar... OMG. (Kim Munhee is a liar! in 1999, Kim Young) Is this for real? It is simple. He started university in 1995 and took a lot of time off. Or maybe he still thinks he is in his 20's. There was a message. He must have written it in the middle of the night. Maybe it is his other persona. She is right. That is the fad nowadays. Sounds wrong to me. Munee, you can still interview him. It might be interesting. It is a good thing. Is that so? Hansol, I have something to tell you. I will be waiting for you in the greenhouse. Hansol. Hiya. Hansol, I was out of my mind that day. I am really sorry. You spelled my name wrong. It is Munee, not Munhee. There is no 'h'. Why don't you apologize for not showing up? I am sorry. I am so smelly. Why are you taking the semester off? Oh, is that why you are here? It is nothing. I just don't think university is for me. I don't really need a diploma. And I am not interested in Korean literature. The real reason is that I want to start making money. Don't take it so seriously. I had no idea. I am sorry I did not tell you. Don't apologize. Munee, I have to go. It is time for the guests to come. Oh, sorry. Go back inside. Study hard. I know you will be fine on your own. You are the one who is fine on your own. After 7 years, I thought I knew him. I guess I was wrong. Still, I think he should graduate. I think he is being hasty. I think it is good that he has goals and plans. Honestly, I envy his smarts. I guess you are right. Didn't you say you wanted to ask me something? Oh, the thing is... I don't know a lot of girls. I would like to hear your opinion. Dating advice? How did you know? Go on, then. Well... I think I met my soulmate. It feels like a miracle. It is your first date, right? Wear something nice, but not too nice. Huh? Your hair should look... Nice, but not too nice! No, it should look great. Hair is important for men. Hiya. Now, let's plan out the dating course. No worries. Any girl will love my plan. I am extremely worried. First, we are going to visit a farm. We are having sandwiches and pork ribs for dinner. Then, we will have apple juice and parfait for dessert. Wait! Are you seriously a tween? There are so many problems. At the end of the night, have wine or beer at a nice bar. Oh, alcohol? Yes! This place is so nice. I know. Your hair... My hair? Is it weird? It is just... It looks futuristic. It looks good. Really? Whew. Thanks. Cheers. Thank you. Here. Thanks. Hansol, can you guess? Guess what? What name do flowers hate? I know, Wilton! Flowers don't like to wilt! Wow, you are so smart. Do you have any more? We are seeing a movie tomorrow. Will you help me choose? What are the options? 'Attack the Gas Station' or 'Shiri'. 'Shiri'? Yes, I am here. Is someone with you? You said 'Shiri'... 'Shiri' is a 1999 spy film. Kim Yunjin turned out to be the culprit. Go get your mom. Don't you recognize your dad's voice? She is not there? Do you have any more? Hello? Isn't your mom home? Where did she go? You don't know? That was a fun movie. It was so funny. Didn't you say you wanted to see 'Shiri'? My friend saw it first and told me the entire story. What a bad friend. That is called a spoiler. Spoiler? Where should we go now? Wow, you are good! You will break the machine! Wow! Hansol, that was... This, this, and this. Okay. Let's start taking pictures! One, two, three! Who are you interviewing? A university student living in 1999. I don't understand what you mean. Well... He was a university student in 1999. Oh. What is your theme? Well... Dreams and love. Dreams and love? Dreams and love. That is terrific. Make your presentation next class. Okay. That is all. Thank you, professor! (I am an idiot,) (who talks about love these days?) Yong, what is your university life like? It is really hectic. I will be a senior next year. I wanted to get to know myself when I came to university. But assignments and life are getting in the way. Even when I am hanging out with my friends, I am nervous. Sometimes, I just go and sit at the library. Isn't that idiotic? No, I understand. I am the same way. Did you choose a career path? Do you have any dreams? Dreams are a burden to me. They are a hassle, and they are irritating. I want to let them go. But I can't get rid of them. (Writing Notebook) They are white elephants. Dreams should not be like that. How about a talking stage between you two? Talking what? Your talking stage. It is the step before a relationship. Do you mean the chase? Confess your feelings for her. Then, she will look at you differently. What is she like? She is... A miracle I found when I was desperate. I want to become someone worthy of her. Oh, that could be my new dream! I can tell by your voice that you really like her. Is it that obvious? Love is all about timing. You should follow your heart, instead of listening to my advice. Honesty always works. Go, Kim Yong! You can do it! We made curfew, right? Yes. We ran like we were shooting a commercial. Youths, run toward your goals! I will get going. See you tomorrow. Okay, get inside. Good night. Have a dream of me. Follow your heart. Honesty always... Hansol. Yes? Starting from tomorrow... Would you go out with me? My heart is still racing. Your words gave me courage. I can tell just by your voice. Your love story is warming my heart, too. Do you like anyone? Me? If love is all about timing, I am way off. I don't know your situation, but don't give up on love. That would be... So lonely. That is right. But sometimes, there is no choice. I always have to hide my feelings. Those girls come here to see Youngji? Yeah. No way. It is true. Do you want to go on a trip with me? Are you okay? Did I say something shocking? Yes! What is gotten into you? You are always studying. I thought it would be good for you. Every day, I am trying hard not to fall in love with him. I can tell by your voice that you like him a lot. Is that so? It makes me curious. We have been friends for 7 years. Not about him. About you. I am curious about you, too. I want to tell you everything. Weirdly, it feels like we are old friends. Me, too. We might become BFFs. BFFs? BFs forever. BFs? It means that we are totes best friends. You keep using strange words. King Sejong will be back tumbling in his grave, right? What? Back tumbling? Back tumbling! That is so creative! (Kim Yong enrolled in 1995) That joke is way ahead of its time! Wait, 1995? What is your major? Mechanical engineering. No way. My dad majored in mechanical engineering. Do you know Kim Eunsung? How do you know Eunsung? He is my dad! Are you close with him? Yeah, we have been friends since high school. OMG! Are you telling me that you are Eunsung's daughter? Yes! This is ridiculous. Who the heck are you? Did he put you up to this? It is true, my dad is Kim Eunsung. I could not believe it, either. I thought you were lying. But you don't sound like a liar at all. Sometimes, life is stranger than fiction. It is hard to explain, but... We are using some kind of time machine. Are you saying this is all real? Yes, isn't it freaky? This is insane! Then, your Ham radio... It is my dad's. He used to use it in high school. I am using his Ham, too. The one with the faded sticker? There is no sticker. Look closely. It is on the left side. Left side? There is nothing here. I don't see it, Munee. You must know my mom, too. How would I know your mom? Don't you know Seo Hansol? My parents were both parts of the student council. Wait... You are lying about Eunsung and Hansol getting married? It is the truth! Why would I lie about my parents? Yong, this is crazy. But I trust you. You trust me too, right? Munee, you have a great imagination. You should turn it into a movie. My mom and dad were a famous couple at school. Are you sure you don't know? What the heck... Mokman, what is going on? The end is nigh! The world will... It won't end! Yes, it will! The apocalypse is coming! What are you doing? What is wrong? Excuse us. Hey, my leg still hurts. It is not true, right? What? Eunsung, tell me the truth. Do you know Kim Munee? Min Munee? Kim Munee! Who is that? Are you two playing a prank on me? What are you talking about? Yong, what is wrong? Kim Yong... Never mind. I must have been out of my mind. That has always been the case. Why did not you tell me you were out of the hospital? I did not need your help. Let's go, Hansol. Okay. Hansol, do you want some help with your math quiz? I will get you past exam papers. That is the most efficient way to study. Then, you will have more time for me. I will be fine. You have more to study for. Hansol. Why were you with Eunsung? He is the student council president. I am the freshman representative. Why would you do that? Yong... It is all battered up. I tried to stop them. I guess you were not injured that badly. What is wrong? Did you check with the administration office? They can't share private information. (Kim Eunsung) That is my dad. Your parents are returning to Korea next year, right? Yeah, next year. Youngji... These might be the strangest and most important events of my life. I might regret it if I just neglect them. Why do you feel that way? I am not sure. I am acting strange, aren't I? So... What is his name? Yong, you should leave. This is a meeting. Don't mind me. There is my BF! Get out. I will kill you. What is wrong with you? I get that you like her, but there is a line. She is meeting other representatives for the first time today. You are making her uncomfortable. Go cool off. There you are. I think love is making me blind. Crazy jackass. If you are going to act like this, just drop out. Wow, Geuntae can't keep a secret. What secret? I have known you for years. I know what you are good at, and what you like. Mechanical engineering is not for you. You are just forcing yourself. Your dream is to become a writer, right? People can't only do what they like. You are going to live life doing what you don't like? Damn it... You should quit smoking. Thanks. I won't give up. On love, or your dreams? Yong, we are here. Eunsung, you are here too? I brought the freshmen. Kim Eunsung, answer the phone now and then. Wash your face and sober up. Hurry up. Are you leaving? Yeah. But we brought a lot of beers. Goodbye, then. Go study. Hansol, sit here. Yong. Oh... Come on in. It is a bit messy. Namhae dragged us here. I am sorry to barge in. No, it is fine. Do you like reading? I guess. It is just a hobby. Oh, a Ham radio! Do you know how to use it? Does it work? What should I do? Hansol... I will teach you next time. Promise me? Of course. I will give you a gift in return. Don't remove this sticker. It is a good picture of us. Not until you keep your promise. Okay? I will wait for you outside. Is it Dad's? Kim Yong... (Mommy) Hello? Mom... Munee. Apparently... He suddenly disappeared. My mom's first love... I cheered him on. He was an idiot in love. I really wanted him to become happy. I guess I could feel how much he loved my mom. Youngji, did I ruin everything? What if I said something that I should not have? If your words ruined their relationship... They would have broken up, no matter what. So, don't blame yourself. (Mechanical Engineering Forever) That is so scary. They have no sportsmanship. They might kill us with those shovels. Mechanical engineering! If you win, there is no class tomorrow! Let's beat them! Behind you! Block him! Nice! Good job! Hey, look alive! Sorry. Pass! Over here, Yong! Are things not going your way? Foul! You are getting a warning. Can you get up? You scumbag, get over here! Hey, hey! Are you okay? Can you move? Is he dead? Try to get up. He started it! That is ridiculous! Breathe. Sit up. Can you get up? Kim Yong... Hey, stop. Where is he going? What are you doing? You denied it. Denied what? What a prick! you denied it! Hey, let go of him! You jerk! What is your name? Choi Dongtak. Students from other departures, leave for a better atmosphere. Are you okay? Yeah, his punches are not strong. Where is Yong? Oh, he just left. He is not a violent person. I have been nagging him about studying. I guess he had pentup anger. He has been stressed about schoolwork and love. When he looked at me, he just exploded. I should not have run my mouth. What I am trying to say is, don't be disappointed in him. Munee... I can't ignore it anymore. My heart... Is full of suspicion. I guess my love is not strong enough. Munee. Did her... Dreams come true? Is she living a happy life? If I keep dating Hansol... Munee might not be born. She might not exist. Mokman... Mokman. Mokman. Mokman. Mokman! Mokman. Mokman... Mokman! Oh, no... Mokman, Mokman! Where is he? Damn it... Where did he go? Mokman. Mokman... Mokman, Mokman. What the heck? Sorry, I... Mokman... Mokman. Mokman... Mokman, don't do this to me. You can't leave me. Mokman, don't abandon me. Mokman! Mokman. I can't do this. I look pathetic. Munee. I am going to stop... Going after her. It was love at first sight. Even if I could turn back time, I would love her again. She was everything to me. I won't lie about being okay. But it could be worse. So, Munee... Don't worry about me. CQCQ. This is Kim Yong. I am signing off. CQCQ. Can you hear me? Hello? Yong, I have something to say. Yong, please respond. (Ham Radio Beginner's Guide Kim Eunsung) I could not meet him in person. But while I was talking with him, I discovered something I had buried deep within me. What was it? It was... Love. They say romance existed in the past. Does it no longer exist? It always exists. We still love. But we try to ignore it due to reallife problems. I wish love were not an obstacle to reality. It should be so widespread that everyone is in love. I wish romance could become reality. Thank you. You didn't. Yes, I did. Munee! I found something. (Time Traveler) What is this? Read it. It must be him. What? The jackass you communicated with. That guy. 'Null' is his pen name. His real name is... Kim Yong. (Author Kim Yong's Book Signing) He has a book signing today, so you can meet him. I can meet him? You said you might regret it if you just neglect it. I will wait here. Go to him.
