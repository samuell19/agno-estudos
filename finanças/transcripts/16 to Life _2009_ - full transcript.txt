[ horn blaring ] The Yangtze river in China is twice as long as the Mississippi. [Narrator] Kate's new book is about the cultural revolution that took place in China 40 years ago. [Kate] China is 12,000 miles from here. Halfway around the world. [Narrator] Kate just discovered that China's population is over a billion, 300 million, yada, yada, yada, people. [Kate] Our county, lumping the farmers farmers and the river town into a stew, is half a person per acre. Give or take a person. Since someone will die this month...

Love you, boo. [Darby] I love you, too. [Harley] Who's your boogerhead? Harley, don't be stupid. 4:00, baby. Hey. Hey. Your hair needs to be wet. Oh, okay. Okay, so you're in an elevator with a fat man... -[ bell chimes ] -... a man with really, really bad breath, and then a guy whose nose has been, like, completely eaten away by cancer. And you have to have sex with one of them. Who do you choose? That's easy. The fat one. Totally. You guys are sick. Terry never came home last night. You think she hooked up? She's wild. Or maybe she's dead in a ditch. Should I take your necklace off for this? No, it's okay. I don't care. I asked my dad for one. I love it. Hey, Darby? Hmm? Aren't you forgetting something? Oh, my gosh. Happy birthday! Aw, Kate. Sweet 16. -No, no, no. Shut up. -What? I don't want anyone to say it. Say what? -Hi, Crystal. -Hi, Kate. Mom wants a tenderloin, fries, and a Coke. I want fries. [ playing "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" off-key ] Stop it. What? Tender caress. Two French kisses. [ European accent ] Why don't you shove ticket up ass, huh? That's funny. You're funny, Rene JonBenét. -What? Would you just tell me? -Okay. "Sweet 16 and never been kissed." Jesus. You've never been kissed? And you have? Of course. Not even one guy has kissed you, ever? Not even once? That's sad. So, you've never been kissed. It's not a big deal. Nobody cares. Oh, hey, I'm gonna have sex with Harley. -What? -In less than eight hours. [ bell tolling ] We were gonna wait. I got bored. Well, what about my birthday? I had plans. Oh. I bought you a present. Happy birthday. Ow. We were gonna wait 'til we loved somebody. Yeah. Well, I do. [ bell dinging ] [Rene] [ normal voice ] Burger. [ sighs ] 'Til we were in real love. We are in real-- You know what? Eff you. Crystal. -Pshhhh! -Katie, how's the world? Actually, it sucks. -The egg? -Yeah. How about you, Ben? Nothing. Why don't you play right down there? Just sit down. Go. So, what's up? I'm reading that book you gave me on the cultural revolution in China. Really? What do you think? You know, it's just... It's a little hard to understand. I mean, there's people spying on each other and turning in their families. It's like Mao was God. Well, you have to understand that the Chinese have suffered for centuries under the feudal lords, right? And Mao was like-- He was like their hope, their liberator. Yeah, but I would never turn in my family. You're very noble, Kate. -[ bell dinging ] -Makes you think, huh? Yeah, I got to go pick up my mom at the clinic and drop her off before I open up the shop. Drop my nephew off at my sister's. Boy, you can really feel fall in the air, can't you? Canada geese pooping their way to Florida. Must suck to have to come to come out here from California. -Hey. -How is your mom? She's waiting around to die, playing solitaire. That's sad. Yeah. -It's my birthday. -Happy birthday! Thank you! How old are you? 17. Wow. 17. Hmm. Here. That's for you. Ready? All right. We'll see ya. -See ya. -Bye. -Bye! -Bye. All right. Let's go. [Darby] Hey, did that what's-his-face become a quadriplegic in Iraq? [Kate] He's a paraplegic, and it was a snowmobile accident when he was our age. Hey, have you even been watching the time? Um... Kate? [Kate] All right. You need to rinse. Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. You didn't even like giving Harley a blowjob. Having sex is way more intimate. No, it isn't. And I do like giving Harley blowjobs, okay? -Can I help you? -Can I have an ice cream cone? Sure. What kind would you like? Chocolate. Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Damn it. [ tuning guitar ] What's up, guys? Uh, what can I get for you? I didn't know you were gonna be jealous. Maybe you have the hots for me. Maybe you're a lesbian. [ groans ] My hair froze. [ bell clanging ] [ hair dryer whirring ] What the hell? $6.23. -Look at my hair. -For two cones? My hair, bitch. Well, you got waffle instead of sugar, which is a dollar more each. Um, I asked for little gold streaks. I only have $5. Whatever. Just give me what you got. You did this on purpose. My hair is sweet. Aah! I can't have sex like this. What-- what are you doing? You're ruining-- Get out of here! I can't wait 'til this thing comes off. One more week. I didn't do it on purpose. Louise can fix it. Can I help you? I think you can. How are you today? I'm cool. I've seen you around the river. What's good? About the river? In your stand? The egg sandwich. Wonder bread, eggs, fat. I'll have the egg sandwich. Egg sandwich, nose picker. Where are you from? Well, Darby... Minneapolis. Well, summer-house boy, what can I get you to drink? You have a boyfriend? We have shakes and sodas. You choose. I don't know what you like. I'm very easy. I'm not. -He's lucky. -Who? The boyfriend. [ humming ] [ door closes ] Oh, the grill hasn't been cleaned. Yeah, it's a long story, man. I don't like long stories. Put 'em away, please. Hi, Louise. I'm highlighting Darby's hair. I read your horoscope for you. Even though I don't believe in them. Oh, thanks, honey. "You'll be the same age whether you go after your dream or not." Hmm. What's your dream? [Louise] Kate, I'm too old for dreams. You know, this place could use a good cleaning before we close up for the winter. I dated a guy once that was into Mao. -Really? -Yeah. We used to lay around on his futon, all covered in dog hair. I'd listen while he read from Mao's little red book. I pretended to be interested. His idea of foreplay. It's my birthday. Virgo. Makes perfect sense. But I don't believe in horoscopes. All the men in my life, they've been Virgos. Charming, gregarious, pigheaded. With a dark side. Addictions. I don't have addictions. Honey, everybody has addictions. I don't know which is worse, men or cigarettes. It's been so long since I met somebody nice. [ horn blaring ] [ bell dinging ] -Hi, Dad! -Hey, Kate. Hey, Reverend Kerr. Did you enjoy the gun show? Oh, you betcha. Got a couple of gut-hook knives. [ laughing ] That'll put the fear of God in somebody, wouldn't it? Too bad you got to work on your birthday. Yeah. No one could take my place. Happy birthday. Dad, you got the necklace! I didn't think you'd -- -How do you open it? -Gosh, no. It's a stun gun. To protect you. It's kind of a neat little device. Not police caliber. But delivers a shock, so be careful. Could-- could you take it home for me? No, honey. You keep it in your purse. Did you talk to your grandma today? She's sweet 16 and never been kissed. [ echoing ] never been kissed, never been kissed. ... never been kissed. never been kissed, and never been kissed. [ laughing ] Katie girl. Okay, Huckleberry. Let's go. [ groaning, sighing ] [ laughing ] You're not gonna shoot me now, are you? No, I'm... leaning towards agnostic. Oh. What can I get you? Cheeseburger and fries. Drink? Coke? Carson? I changed my mind. I want a lemonade. And a lemonade. One lemon... ade. [ sighing ] Lemonade. Bunny, I don't have any money. I'll get your Coke... bunny. Do you have your period? Electric flashes. Oh, shit. I-- I put the straw from my shake that I was drinking in your Coke. I'm sorry. I'll-- it's disgusting. I'll get you a new one. [ bell dinging ] $4.25. -I'm Carson. -Kate. Hey, bitch. What the hell are you trying to do to me, telling everyone I didn't come home last night? Well, everyone was worried. I didn't know what happened to you. -Ow! -Little miss freakin' perfect Girl Scout kiss-ass. Terry, you're a crazy bitch! Oh, man! [Kate] She didn't even wish me a happy birthday. I'm gonna get you kissed. I don't need your help. Well, if I can't find anybody, we can-- we can always use Rene. Or... you can kiss Harley. [Kate] This is so stupid compared with you having sex. And it's really not about that. -Then what is it about? -[ horn honking ] Sorry. Harley's here. Ow. [Kate] "My father came home one day and told us he was being sent to the countryside to labor with the peasants. He'd been a businessman in Beijing." [ ducks quacking ] I've been sent to duck farm #13 as a farm laborer! [Kate] "I wouldn't see him again for six years." [ ducks quacking ] Goodbye, children. He needs to be re-educated to lose his bourgeois thinking. All I said was, "You're sweet 16 and never been kissed." You turned father in, traitor. [Louise] What am I supposed to say here, huh? I mean, are you even ready for this? Do you even have condoms, for God's sakes? Well, I would use Rene's, but I'm sure it's so old, it's leaky. You know the thing about girls? They're way dirtier than guys are. -Kate? -Bobby. Is my mom in there? She's kind of busy, Bobby. Tell her she needs to pull in that trash receptacle. Too close to a public highway. I don't want to give her a citation. You got a Kleenex in your nostril. Which one? Louise, your son, Bobby, says the garbage needs to be pulled in further from the street. From the first moment I held him in my arms, I knew there was something different about him. By the time he was five, he was writing me up for moving violations. I mean, he wouldn't even let me put the key in the ignition without him being buckled up. Girls, addictions. -Yeah, I'm almost done. -Wait, wait. [Louise] No. Come on. Come, come, come. -Girls, girls. -[ snapping fingers ] Addictions. Come on. Thank you. Vamoose. Tatiana takes my place at 4:00. And she's got a boyfriend. Why are you always setting people up, huh? I'm not. I just think it's sad you're alone. [ bell clanging ] [Louise] You know, you girls don't have to wear your uniforms that short if you don't want to. Well, we like them that way. [ electricity crackling ] [ screaming ] What happened? [ coughing, gagging ] What? I'm gonna kill Rene! Oh, my God. [ coughing ] It's like the Chinese people were brainwashed. I don't get cults. I was in a cult once. It was called marriage. You wouldn't marry again? I don't know what happened. I just couldn't find a good man. Plenty of bad ones. My dad's single. But he's not dating material. Who were you most in love with? Hmm. Someone I was never with. No chance to get disillusioned. [Kate] Maybe you're wiser now. Love and wisdom don't really work together, do they? The head is so far from the heart. I know a guy... you could date. I'm really not that desperate, honey. Thank you. What about tonight? Tatiana might get busy with the Tabernacle people. I could stay, maybe. You are gonna go out and celebrate your birthday. [ bell dinging ] Not work a double shift. Oh, hey, you should come to the Tabernacle later. We've got revival music for Christ at 7:00. Oh, and clog dancers tonight. I don't know what that is. No, clogging, you know? It's really cool. I mean, I'm-- I'm not trained. I just do it for him. Okay. Thank you. Jesus. [ machine whirring ] -Hey, boo. -Hi, babe. I can't wait until 4:00. Stop. I'll bet your virginity is a huge burden right now. Just like you not being kissed. Stop talking about it. God. [ bell dinging ] Yeah, so what's up? Hey, Ronald, you got my message at the store? Yeah. You know it's my birthday. Yeah, you keep reminding me. How can I forget? I do? I want you to give me a present. Can I afford this present? Yes. Are you, um... are you dating anyone? Do you want to? [ chuckling ] Uh, no, and-- and it depends. Good. Are you open to a really great person? Dear God. I can't do this, honey. For my birthday, I want you to go out with a really nice person. Kate, do you-- do you think I'm lonely? If someone were wonderful, but they were missing fingers or something, would that bother you? Is he missing fingers? She's really pretty and really cool, and you're really cool. Tonight? That's tonight? Yes. I mean, otherwise, you'll change your mind. No, I mean, it's just something like that. Like if he were blind or didn't have a sense of smell. Katie, what are you getting at here? Just come here at 8:00. You know, you can go get coffee. It can be really casual. And she wants to go on a blind date. [Kate] Yes, you can. It doesn't really matter what she wants. I know what's best for her. [ bell dinging ] She's really, really great. Mm-hmm. She doesn't smoke... and loves to fish. I don't know about this, Kate. In your horoscope, it says you'll be the same age whether you go after your dream or not. I think your dream is to fall in love. I'm going to the bank. Whoa! He'll pick you up at 8:00. I'll take your place. It's settled. By the way, Rene, you owe me a phone. [ coughing ] I set Louise up with Ronald. Ronald lives with his mom. You live with your mother. Oh, hey, Harley's thinking of who we can find. You told him? I can't believe you. Do you know what he said to me about having sex? He was like, "Baby, don't be nervous. I just want to put my love inside of you." All right. You're getting so annoying. I'm going on break. [ playing chords ] [Kate] "During the revolution, Mao decided lawn grass was bourgeois. Students were ordered to pull it up by hand. The dirt caused dust storms. We were also discouraged from developing romantic attachments. Teenage boys and girls were told to put their energy into making China great. But I had a secret crush on a boy in my school." Chairman Mao says we should be devoted to the revolution, not our personal needs. [ shouting in Chinese ] How can I help you? You're not usually at this window. No, I'm not. I'm usually at that window, way down there. I'll have a cheeseburger and fries and a Coke. -I'm Jordan. -I know. How do you know? I gave you my number. I'm kidding. You came up here with your dad. [ chuckling ] He dropped a little bottle of Kahlúa -into his shake. -[ laughing ] Oh, yeah. That's my old man. [ strumming guitar ] [Rene] Yeah, yeah. What do you think of the guy at Darby's window? He's wearing a pink polo shirt. Anything else you need to know? I know he's kind of full of himself. And there's no electric current. Electric current? You're a sad man. If you've never felt it, I can't explain it. Ah... [Jordan] You don't have a name tag. No, I don't. Can you tell me your name? -Lucinda. -Lucinda. Spanish. You can call me Cindy. -Jordan. -Hmm. But you already knew that. You're very formal, Jordan. -Where are you from? -Madrid. My parents came here when I was a baby. You're from the city. You have a house on the river. [ bell dinging ] Burger. Burger, burger. $4.25. Keep the change. You've got a, uh, beautiful smile. You know that? You're staring at my breasts. If you get bored, Cindy. Or whatever your name is. Kate, someone at your window. Oh, hi, Grandma! [ tires screeching, crashing ] [ hissing ] Tatiana, are you okay? [ Russian accent ] Here. Here. Gas pedal. She is where brake should be. [Kate] Do you need to get your neck checked out? No. No, I have neck brace in trunk from last time. Wow. That, uh, sucks, Tatiana. Um, I have to run. Don't worry. I haven't forgotten about you, okay? I'm still working on it. All right. Just wish me luck. We were going to wait. I'm gonna get my stuff. I talked to your sister, doll. She stayed with friends last night. Yeah. Whatever. You working at the craft store today, Grandma? My feet get so swollen, I go barefoot behind the counter. [ laughing ] Happy birthday, doll. Oh. Hi, Grammy. Happy birthday. Better get to work.

I left my lunch across the street. [Rene] You got it. [ horn blaring ] Hey. Honey, do you think I should have discouraged Darby? I mean, I was 15 when I lost my virginity, so who am I to talk? [Kate] You can have great romance, but die young. Or you can have no romance and live to 100. Die young after great romance. Me, too. Your turn. One of your parents has to die. Who you choose? My mother did die. When I was nine. No. How? Cancer. Hmm. So sad. Okay, if your mother still alive, one of your parents never see you again. Who you choose? I love my dad, but I think mothers need their daughters more emotionally. I choose my dad. I hate my mother. If something happens to her, you're gonna feel horrible. No, I hate. When I'm 12, she come on to me sexually. She have no boundaries, even though she's family therapist. I tell her, put down the vodka and get away from me. This is really good fudge.

Rene won't talk me up. I try. Have you ever had, like... electrical currents... just from talking with someone? Sure! In Russia, we call it... [ speaking Russian ] Bzzz! Aah! [ laughing ] I wonder if I... if I'll always be alone. Yeah, I heard about the kiss. -What? -Darby calls me. She wonder if I know anybody. -She called you today? -Darby called me about you wanting the birthday kiss. The birthday kiss? It's okay. Just natural. You need to get love.

I get a discount on ski equipment, so that's cool. And I helped out this final weekend. Do you ski? Yeah-- No, no. No, not at all. I'll just, uh, have a soda. Can I ask you a question bluntly? Absolutely. If, hypothetically, a girl asked you to kiss her... Hey, bitch. Hi, customer. What flavor? Orange. Clean straw. Oh, it's clean this time. Yes. [ laughing ] So, uh, do you want to get anything for your girlfriend? Oh, the one that calls me bunny? Actually, I don't have a girlfriend. Amber's family owns the summer house right next to ours. We're friends. -[ clearing throat ] -So, um... Thanks, Kate. -Wow. Who is the hottie? -Shh! I haven't seen him around. Well? [ bell dinging ] -Well, what? Would you like something to eat? -Are you gonna make me ask? -Ask what? You know what. [Rene] Ah, shit. What do you think? Harley came here first. He was looking for you. You know, you've never opened your birthday present. Nice wrapping paper. I know how you love cashews. They're half empty. Or half full, just depending on how you look at it. I was a little hungry when I was wrapping it, so... Can I actually have some of it? So, you can either have great sex or children, but not both. What do you choose? -Well, in Duck Farm Num-- -Ugh, boring. I don't want to hear about that anymore. First it was that creepy Holocaust thing. You didn't even look at that book about the guy who survived Auschwitz. It was one of the most uplifting books I've ever read. [ beeping ] If you're happy, I'm glad. Cut the Girl Scout crap. Oh, God. You're still here. I'm like a shark. I-- I don't sleep. I just circle and make shakes. Well, how about two, Cindy? J.J., I want cherry. Uh, a-- a vanilla and a cherry. Well, we don't have cherry, J.J., but we do have chocolate or vanilla. Nothing, then. You sure? One vanilla. [teen girl] I'm still mad at you. You said we'd go on the river today. I had to get the boat into storage for winter. Dad was on me. Well, I waited all afternoon. You could have called. Aah! -Hi. -Hi. So... how's it going? How's it going? Oh, just fucking awesome, Jordan. Who's she? [ door slamming ] Just local trash. But she knew your name. Crush on me, babe. [ paper rustling ] Uh, $2. [ register whirring ] [ footsteps approaching ] [ knock on door ] -Darby? -[ knock on door ] Darby, open up. Well, now you know what it feels like. Hey, which-- which fuse turns off the freezer? It's not a fuse. It's, uh-- it's the cord right here. You know, why didn't I ever think of that? 'Cause you're too nice. What is going on? Darby? When I left today, I ran into Jordan outside. [ birds chirping ] Jordan? Yeah. His family has that summer cottage over-- -I know who he is. -You do? Yeah. Anyway, we were talking, and he just asked me to hang out with him. On your way to lose your virginity? I was just gonna stop for a minute. His boat was right on the water. So, what are you saying? He was really into me. It just kind of happened. ♪ Waiting for the moment to arrive ♪ ♪ I get so excited What are you doing? [ cellphone ringing ] You had sex with Jordan, who, by the way, is a total player, when you were supposed to have sex with Harley? You're jealous, okay? Fine. Just drop the holier-than-thou attitude. Instead of having sex with the guy that you love, you had sex with a creep that you just met! You don't even know how I feel. -[Harley] Darby? -Oh, God. Where's Darby? Um... Her mom's car is here. I know she's here, so don't lie, 'cause I'll come in there. Moo is here. I called you, like, five times. Where were you? Hi, boo. We were supposed to meet. Did you forget? No. No. Um, my mom asked me to do some errands for her. I'm really sorry. That's interesting, because I talked to your mom. My phone broke. I would have called you. She didn't even know where I was all day. I waited at your house, and then I drove around looking for you. And then my buddy Steve calls me. He and his dad are plumbing somebody's summer cottage. And he sees a girl he thinks is you walking with some asshole into his boathouse. And I said, "You're full of shit, man, 'cause Darby wouldn't do that." Right? 'Cause we had a date. A sort of important date? I know. He said some other things. Harley, I'm really sorry. I want the fucking second set of keys to my truck! You could have stopped her! You wanted to break us up! [ sighing ] This birthday so sucks! You're emotionally ten. You've probably never even masturbated. I've masturbated. A lot! What? I don't like your attitude. I want the cook. Rene, Hell's Angel man wants you. [ latch rattling ] [ door closing ] Hi. Hey, your accent-- I noticed from earlier. Are-- are you Czech? Oh, no, man, I was only kidding around with the accent. My mother's Czech. -Yeah? -Yeah. You think there's something funny about that? I'm really sorry. Look, uh, how about a hot-fudge sundae? It's my favorite. I'd like that. Okay. Okay. -You ignoring me? -Come on, Kate. Who wants to be judged all the time? I don't like being judgmental, but I have a finely honed sense of what's right. It's my birthday. So? Hitler had a birthday, too. [Kate] Oh, that's an odious comparison. You know how sympathetic I am for the Jewish people. "Odious"? [ scoffs ] You've never even met a Jew, Kate. Yes, I have! Tatiana's Jewish. No, Tatiana is Russian. And you know what your problem is? You read too much. Okay? You know too much about the Holocaust and being Black in America. Oh, and Chapstick addictions? Come on, Kate. You're nuts. I thought you would find it interesting that people could be addicted to Chapstick! [ voice breaking ] And technically, it's not the Chapstick that's addictive. It's the putting it on that's addictive. [ sniffling ] [ water lapping ] [Louise] I never said I was sorry. [Ronald] No, you did. You came and saw me when I was in Cedar Rapids. I guess you forgot. [ mid-tempo music playing on radio ] You were wearing a green sweater. Your hair was all wavy and long. [ Louise clearing throat ] Yeah. Mind if I smoke? [ chuckling ] -Kate said you didn't smoke. -[ sighing ] That's because she wanted me to have a date. [ both chuckling ] [ couple moaning ] Want to hear some music? Sure.

[ sighing ] To set the record straight, I probably would have raced him anyway. Really? You didn't just race him to show him up because of me? Of course I did. I was in love with you. You know, or as in love as a 16-year-old can possibly be, which probably had more to do with lust. [ both laughing ] You know, Louise, don't feel sorry for me.
