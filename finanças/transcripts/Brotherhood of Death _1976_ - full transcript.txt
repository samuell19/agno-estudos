Reading what Johnson is doing up there in Washington for these damn niggers down here. Worst thing is, you know all the niggers down here, they didn't want none of that stuff, that free stuff 'til the federals started spoon feedin' 'em. I mean they were happy. You know, took it easy. - [Man] Right. - [Leroy] They didn't work too hard, they had plenty of work when they needed it, and that's all there was to it. They sees them out there in the fields and they feel sorry for them, and they said ah look, they're working too hard. They don't realize all them years of breeding in Africa made 'em fit for that physical labor, I mean they like it. (man laughs) 'Course picking bananas off the trees made 'em lazy.

They might teach you how to walk. - No, it'd teach him how to duck. - You gonna join the army? - Me? - Mm hmm. - Oh yeah, I'm gonna join the army alright. I'm gonna become one of them things you call a killer. - Well okay. - Yeah, you just want to plaster a uniform. - Like when you were an usher. - Impressed you didn't it, baby? - It wasn't your uniform, sweetheart. - Well, what was it then? - Your sparkling blue eyes. (laughing) - Oh! - Hey! - [Man] You idiot! - Gimme some gas. - [Attendant] High test? - Regular. Make that 87 cents worth. Raymond, Raymond, come here, Raymond, come here. - What you, what you want, man? - I'll bet you $10 I make that shot, what you say? - Oh man, you ain't got $10. - Well it don't matter 'cause I'll make it anyhow. - Get on out of here, man, let me show you how to do it. - Quit pushing on me! - Make this thing, man. (laughs) Yes! - You know that's luck, don't you? - Need something, mister? - Yeah, fill it up. Look at that. Them God damn niggers breed like flies, don't they? God damn! - Oh, the mother fucker didn't go in. - Hey boy, don't you know there's a white woman in that car? Now you listen to me, you gotta go over there and apologize for what you just said and then you clean your mess off my car. - Like hell I will. - Well, like hell you won't. Now you just come right on. - Hey man, take your hands off me. - Now listen, I'm going to punish you. - Hey man. - What you doing? - I'm gonna get you niggers for this. (engine revs) - Let's get outta here. - Raymond, see I done told you about your temper, boy. You gotta watch out for them white boys. - Every time I save your ass, I'm the one that got us in trouble. - With Winniford. The news is out that the Ku Klux Klan is out after us. In fact, we're the A number one reason for them getting back into high gear. - Shit, I don't much like running away. - [Driver] But you like breathing, don't you? - What makes you think it's gonna be any better in the army? - Well you got to get into a good outfit, you see? The better trained you are, the better chances you got. Eh, we get into that special forces thing, then maybe we can stay together. - Special forces! Man, are you crazy? We'll go to war, for sure. - Being as how there's a war, we gonna go to war anyway. - We'll have to jump outta airplanes. (explosions booming) (gunfire popping) (men yelling) (explosion booms) (gunfire popping) - We're supposed to ambush them. That asshole test got the whole thing all ass backwards. - I know one thing man, I ain't going back out there no more. I'm tired, they can have this damn war. - Shit, fat lotta a choice you got, you got us into this damn war. - Me? You the one suggested that we come here in the first place. - Damn, it doesn't make any difference. Somebody must know what he's doing out here. We gotta join up with something better fore it's too late. - Hi, men, this is Captain Quinn. He says he has a proposition for us. - That's right, Captain Quinn. On your feet, soldiers. You grunts had your butts in the grass long enough to know this here is a jungle war, guerrilla war, only it's being fought by men who think it's World War I. Fixed defenses that get overrun. Shit, fixed defenses are something to hide in and not fight from and my men don't fight from no fixed defenses. We're hunters and we stay on offense. We eat cold meals out of a can and sometimes we sit stone still for hours while the bugs crawl all over us but we kill a lot of charlie and they don't kill many of us. Now if you want in, I can arrange it. If you don't, I hope you bastards can run 'cause you're gonna be picking 'em up and putting 'em down. - Well God damn, Captain. - This could be your guts spilling all over the terrain. This is a sick ass war, troops. The enemy's imagination is unlimited. And when you're out with Quinn, you're right in the VCs backyard. Now they put these in the ground. Some grunt comes along, steps on it and Charlie racks up another casualty. So we got hip and we installed steel inserts. So Charlie comes right back at us with something else like this. Now the spikes are pointed downwards. Try to jerk your foot out, the deeper they dig in and no steel insert's gonna stop that. Alright, here's another one of Charlie's toys. We call this a mud tato. The rain peels the potato and the potato peels your ass. Now since you never know what Charlie's gonna leave behind for you, the only thing that you can do is try to avoid the places where he's likely to leave 'em. Now never take a path and never walk parallel to one. Never take the easiest route around anything. Look out for bridges and watch out for stepping stones. Cross where it's deep, don't cross where it's shallow. Charlie can do more with a river bed... - We could take this night advantage away from the VC. You up for a little night fighting? - Why not? - Get the VC so God damn jumpy, they'd start shooting themselves. - Yeah but if the VC moved big at night, we might run into a big forest. - Now you know how Charlie feels about us during the day. (gunfire pops) (explosions booming) - We got cut off. We're in trouble, as soon as those rockets stop. (gunfire pops) (explosions booming) (gunfire pops) - [Man] Halt. Who goes there? - Private Moffat, Private Tiese and Private Moffat. - [Man] Advance one to be recognized. (speaking in foreign language) - [Man] Come forward. You guys with Quinn? - [Man] Yeah. - [Man] Quinn bought it. - [Man] What? - He's dead. (coughing) - Good, huh? That stuff is bad, man. - It's bad alright. - Come on, Junior, get up off of it. (coughing) - Do you know the world's largest smack factory is right here in Saigon? - Yeah, but you don't want none of that stuff, Junior. - It's worth a lot of money stateside. - Yeah. - You know, the kid got a point. - Takes a big bank roll though, Junior. - That's the new thing. We could pool it. As a matter of fact, I already got some investors. - Be cool, man, be cool. - You got the shit? - You got the bread? - No, no, no, no. Let me see it. - Let me see the bread. - Watch it, that stuffs almost pure. - What'll it cut to? - I don't know. Depends on how greedy you are and how eager your customers are. 100 to one maybe. - Hey, little something for all my sicks friend, huh? - Right. Let me know when your friends get sick again. (funky music) - I sure am glad to see y'all. Relly. - How you doing Ace? - Well, I know she gonna be glad you back, Raymond. Sure thought that street corner was gonna fall down without you holding it up, Ned. You guys sure looking sharp. Hey, you want a drink? Can I get y'all a drink? (funky music) - Lay it on, Ace. - So get out of KP and go down to the dispensery and guess what? It turns out he got the clap. (laughing) - Ace. Did you know Winniford? - Mm hmm. - Does he still have it in for us? - It's been a long time. - What do you know? He ain't the kind of person that'd be getting over these things kind of easy like, you know? - Well, I heard something awhile back. He had a few (mutters). They got over that soon enough. - [Raymond] Shit, I ain't afraid of that son of a bitch. - You ain't afraid, huh, Raymond? What you gonna do, off him? - [Raymond] Shit I might. - Oh forget about him. He's small potatoes anyway. Anyway, when are we gonna get out of these monkey suits and get some real clothes? - Monkey suits? Jimmy, this might be a monkey suit to you but in this suit, I feel just like King Albert. - You look like King Kong. - You are King Kong, nigger. (laughs) - Raymond, you never could hold your liquor. - Shit, don't you drink to get drunk? - I guess some of us do. - Being that you're so good at it. - Oh, get off my case, Junior. - Now come on, come on y'all. You want another drink, Raymond. Ace, give him another drink. Give everybody another drink. - Yeah, yeah, let's do it, do it. - [Man] Hey Ned, come on, man, let's get out of here. - [Man] Hey Ned, time to hit the road. - Go away, man, I'm busy. - [Man] Come on, man. (knocking) - [Man] Hey Ned! - (growls) Jesus Christ, will you look at this here. - Boy, this fool had a good time last night, didn't he? - 'Cause he sure paying for it now. - He must've had a DTs. - Yeah, I think he needs our help. (Ned exclaims) - Come on, man. Why don't y'all get out of here and leave me alone? Why we got to go to Montgomery? - So nobody here knows how much money we got. - Come on, man, they got all them bad stores down in Montgomery. We can buy some rags and shit. - Oh, come on, Raymond. Them stores'll be there when we get there. Just leave me alone, man, leave me alone. - Come on, man. (horn beeping) Man! - Get up here. - Take your hands off me. You want to go, then let's go. Driver, onward to Montgomery. And watch the holes in the road. (laughing) - [Woman] Quiet, Jimmy. - [Jimmy] Why? Come on. - What if somebody comes by? - Ain't nobody coming out here, okay? - What if I said you just don't turn me on anymore? - Well then you're gonna have to give me a chance to redeem myself. - You slow down, you gotta take your clothes off anyway. You gotta get your shoes off too. - [Jimmy] Come on. - Jimmy, what if I said, not today, sucker? - Hey, come on! (laughing) God damn, tease. Hey, come on! Well, that's more like it. (funky music) (laughing) - Hey Snowball. - What you got on your mind? - What do you want? - Nothing boy, you go right ahead, we just gonna sit down and make ourselves comfortable. Now don't cover up, hon, we ain't seen nothing yet. - Maybe he ain't up to it. - (laughs) Is that right, boy? - He ain't gonna do nothing. - Well then, maybe we just gonna have to do something for that boy. (woman screams) - [Man] Get that nigger outta here. (panting) - Hey, got you now, got you now! - [Woman] No. - Slide down there, you bitch. (laughing) - Please stop. - Gonna split me some black oak. - [Woman] No! No! (woman exclaiming) - It's your last one today. You know, you owe me $6. - Okay, well just fill up the glass and we'll talk tomorrow. - All you got is mouth. - What's happening, Ace? - I don't know. This whole Louise Freeman business is bugging the hell out of me. - Yeah? - Yeah, I mean like, you know-- - Hey Ace, what's happening catch? - [Ace] Oh, look at this, must be some kind of parade in town. - Oh, just shut your mouth, fool and pour me something kind of tall, sweet and nice. - [Ace] You got a deal, coming up. - Hey. - Hey. (men muttering) - Y'all hear about Louise Freeman? - No, what about her? - [Ace] She got raped, that's what. - By who? - [Ace] Winniford and two pals. - Winniford? - Yeah, she and her boyfriend, they got jumped by them. They beat her boyfriend up and then two of 'em nailed her. - And? Well, what happened to 'em? - [Ace] That's just it, ain't nothing happened. - You mean they got away with it? - Yeah, they walking around like, ain't nothing happened. - Well Ace, did somebody call the cops? Do they know? - The cops don't give a shit. - Well, I give a shit. - Well, you ain't the cops. - Now come on, man. When something like this happen, we all go to the church and we have a meeting and we-- - Fat lotta good that's gonna do. - That's just the way things are around here. - Well, we'll see about that. (ominous music) (yelling) (men grunting) (punches thudding) - Oh shit. - Well Leroy, look like a God damn highway fatality there. - Hey, you got no cause to make jokes, especially not with you standing there on my porch and a whole gang of niggers rampaging through Kincaid County. - Oh, there's a gang of 'em huh? - That's right. - Well, how many would you say there was? - Had to be at least five. - Five of 'em, huh? Did you recognize any of 'em? - No, they come up behind me in the middle of the night. - Well, I mean was there a tall one or a short one? - I told you, they come from behind. You can't tell one nigger from another in the middle of the night no how. - And they didn't steal anything, huh? - They didn't steal anything. - Now let me see if I got this straight, Leroy, you're telling me that five black men that you never saw before attacked you for no apparent reason? - That's right. - Uh huh. Leroy, I got to tell ya, I think you brought this on yourself. - Jim, what are you trying to drive at? - What I'm trying to tell you, Leroy, is that if you're smart, you will just forget this whole incident right now. - Forget it? Hell, eight niggers come along here on my property in the middle of the night and try to kill me and you tell me to forget it? Jim, you ought to go down to nigger town right now and arrest a few of them bucks, make a few examples out of 'em. - Alright now, Leroy, listen to me, you know and I know why you were attacked and unless we call a halt to this thing right now, things in this county are just gonna go from bad to worse. - You know, Jim, I can't believe my ears. I mean, you sound like a God damn nigger lover. - You can that talk, Leroy. Now listen to me, Leroy, we don't know who beat you up but we sure as hell know who raped that Negro girl now, don't we? - You ain't got no proof. - You are just damn lucky that I didn't throw your ass in the slammer then and I might still do it. So you watch what you call me, Leroy. - You need to protect white folks not niggers. - I am paid to keep the peace and that means keeping the crazies off the street. Now right now that includes you, Leroy. So you watch your step. (ominous tones) - Does the sheriff know? - Yes, the sheriff knows but he says Winniford's got three witnesses says he was playing cards all night. - Lot of good it'd do to be going to that sheriff. - Now don't judge the sheriff just because-- - Now listen, preacher, listen, now when's the last time they done locked up some white man for raping one of our women? - Now don't get like that. - Well, we can't let 'em get off scot free. - Well, we're sending a petition to the county attorney. Maybe with some outside pressures of community pressure, we'll let 'em know that we won't stand for such abuse and treatment of our young people. - Reverend, how many of your petitioners are voters? - Not too many, I'm afraid. - Well then, the county attorney won't pay it any mind. He don't care about black folks in the first place and especially if they don't vote. - Look, I tried to lead him. They're set in their ways. They won't follow me to register. They want nothing to do with government. - There are more black people in this county than white. Now if we got 'em all out to vote, we could have our own county attorney and sheriff. - Junior, I don't know. You might be right. - How would you do it? You'd have to reach a lot of people. - The Baptist churches are a natural network for getting the word out. - Brothers and sisters, the word today comes from the book of Proverbs where it say, when the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice but when the wicked bear rule, the people mourn. We have been a mournful people, torn from our homelands, our loved ones and our heritage. We are the slave labor upon which this land of freedom and justice was built. - Amen. - [Congregation] Amen. - [Preacher] Am I right or wrong? - [Congregation] You're right. - We have felt the oppressor's whip upon our backs, his rope around our necks and his bullet in our hearts and yet, we have persevered. Well, the Lord was with us. - [Congregation] Yes he was. - He gave us strength. - Praise the Lord. - Oh, praise the Lord. - He brought us far. - Outta the valley. - But the journey is far from over. There are still wicked men who would deny us the right to live and prosper as free people of this society. - Preach it, brother, preach it. - For today we possess a weapon which would deny them the power to do this. We have the capacity to utilize the tool that dictates the will of a free people, the one instrument that ensures our future and our rights as free people, the ballot, our votes. Your vote, sister and yours, brother and my vote. - Hallelujah, amen. - Amen. - We will support the righteous and we will vote to cast out the wicked. - Hallelujah. - Amen. - We will vote and the people will rejoice. - [Congregation] Amen. - Man, you better get out off that bottle and get on down to that courthouse and register. (upbeat music) - Nice shopping. (music overpowers voices) - Excuse me, I came to register. - Register to vote? (upbeat music) Here, take these forms with you. (music overpowers voices) Yeah, you too, you all want to vote, how many? - Come on, come on. You just go right up there and stand in line. - The niggers is taking over the town. - Raise your right hand, raise your right hand. - What? By the busload? - This place is full of Negros. - Now look, you close down that office. I don't care, you just close it down now. - Maybe I'll run for sheriff. - You, a law man? - Well, why not? - 'Cause you'll wind up arresting yourself. - Now who'd ever heard of a cop arresting himself? (upbeat music) - [Raymond] We're trying to introduce a new breed of lawmen into the county. - Well, I ain't got nothing to hide. - You ain't got nothing to hide, huh? Then what about your source of wealth, huh? - Well if anybody ask, I'll lock 'em up. - Oh, you gonna lock 'em up? - You can't lock up a string bean. - Hi Junior. - Newt! - Hey, what's happening? - Hey man. - You doing man? - Hey man, you gonna get out of school this year or you gonna have Mr. Howard ragging your ass again? - Oh, no way, man. I got out of there and I'm getting out of this town, too. I'm a college boy. - Football! - Alright, Penn State. - Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go with you. - Junior, they ain't got a uniform small enough. (siren wails) - Not to play fool, to take classes, you've got to do that too. - Yeah, I'm ready. (yelling) - The church is on fire! It's burning down! (men exclaiming) - [Junior] I guess we really pissed 'em off this time. - Well that's it, man, I've had it. Want war man, let's give it to 'em. (laughing) - Did you see that big dirt pile? They burning on the wind now. Oh yeah, now Sheriff, if you don't mind I'll be taking a little pull on that. You know we keep up this sort of thing, there ain't gonna be no niggers left in this county to shine our shoes. - You can say that. I ain't had so much fun since my brother-- - Now hold on, hold on just a minute, Night Hawks, Night Hawks, Night Hawks of the Ku Klux Klan, I give you the grand cyclops whose identity we are all bound never to reveal. (snapping fingers) - Night Hawks of the Ku Klux Klan, tonight this klan has reached the highest glory. The foundation of Christian life that has persevered in the most demanding of times including carpet bagging invasions from the north, Jewish treachery and deceit and an international Catholic conspiracy spearheaded by a Catholic president has once again survived the severest test. Communist agitation, of simple minded Negroes who think themselves the social and political equal of the white man. Now those responsible have felt the full fury of our wrath but to kill the snake, gentlemen, you must first cut off its head. Now we know who is responsible for this revolt against the Christian sanctity of our land. Three obstreperous Negroes instigating a heinous plot involving the colored churches have incited the peaceful Negroes of this country to challenge the white leadership that has served us all so well for so long. These men, Raymond Moffat, Junior Moffat and Ned Tiese, are responsible for this conspiracy. Now let their sentence for these crimes be swift and terrible. Let the long and righteous arm of the Ku Klux Klan reach out and smite those who would dare to defile our Christian civilization. (men yelling) (mysterious music) - [Junior] Hey I could use some help. (funky fusic) (gunfire pops) (laughing) - You like that boy? You got plenty more coming if you don't admit to what you done. - Fuck off, white man. (punch thuds) - God damn, hot headed nigger. - Shit, my old man used to hit me harder than that. - Now hold on just a minute, Myrick. Ain't no need to waste yourself on this boy. We gonna be scientific about this. Now, I ain't seen no nigger yet that would burn before he'd say anything you want, Myrick. What's it gonna be nigger, you gonna burn or you gonna talk? - What the hell's going on here? Back off, Leroy. - This boy killed one of his own people. - That don't give you the right to torture him, does it. You got a case against this boy or are you just getting your rocks off? Jesus Christ, Myrick. First it's Leroy here and now you. Just keep it up, keep it up. Pretty soon I'm gonna have the whole God damn klan in the slammer. Alright boy, now did you kill somebody? - I didn't kill nobody but somebody did 'cause Newt Biggars is shot. - Been shot? Myrick, did you test this boy for powder burns? - [Myrick] No sir. - Jesus Christ. Well there's one simple way to solve this then, ain't there? Untie him. Untie him! - Well, well, well, you don't look too bad, Raymond, not for the bruise. - [Junior] What's going on? - They said I shot Newt Biggars. - Shot Newt Biggars? He dead? - Stone dead. - They tested me for powder marks then they let me go. - Let you go? After he beat you up? - No, it wasn't the sheriff. It's that damn Myrick and some dudes that the sheriff called Klansmen. - [Junior] That's a big surprise. - [Ned] Hey Raymond, who do you think shot Newt? - I know who shot Newt. It was that Turner. I saw his car driving off. - You tell the sheriff that? - You think I'm crazy? With Myrick and them Klansmen still in there, I aint saying nothing. Soon as they go, I'll tell the sheriff. I got something to say to you about tonight, Sheriff. - Oh come on now, boy, you know damn good and well that the county attorney is not gonna prosecute that deputy for what he did to you. - I ain't talking 'bout me Sheriff. I know who shot Newt. It was Harold Turner, the county attorney. - Shit boy, get out of here. - [Raymond] I saw his car, Sheriff. - Well hell, that's no proof. - [Raymond] You could test him for powder burns. - Maybe I could, maybe I couldn't. - Uh huh. You want me to go to the papers then, huh? Tell them you refused to follow a lead on a murder? - Now wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, alright, alright. Now we'll go and we'll test Harold Turner for powder burns, alright? - [Raymond] That's awful white of you, Sheriff. (chuckles) - No Leroy, I got rid of the gun. No, no, there's no way they can pin it on me. We starting a rumor that the niggers did it anyway. Yeah. Well, what difference does it make if nobody believes us, huh? (doorbell ringing) Who the hell is that? Come in. No, no, it's just somebody at the door. Yeah, now look, you just relax now, Leroy. I'll get back to you as soon as I can, alright? Now keep calm. Alright, talk with you, bye bye. Well, Sheriff, didn't hardly expect to see you this time of night. - [Sheriff] Harold. - [Harold] What can I do for you? - Well Harold, this boy here has a pretty serious charge against you. - [Harold] Oh? What's that? - He claims he saw you shoot and kill a Negro man by the name of Newt Biggars. - Why now that's ridiculous. - Yeah, yeah. Well that's what I told him. So I figured you wouldn't mind if I was to test you for powder burns. - [Harold] Mind? Of course I'd mind. - Oh come on now, Harold, just take a minute. Now you don't want to make yourself look guilty, do you? - That's what he's afraid of. - Yeah, just to prove him wrong. - No, absolutely not. - Now don't be a fool, Harold. You know I don't need a warrant to test you. What do you want me to do, arrest you for failure to cooperate? - I said no, John. You going crazy listening to this nigger? - You the one that going crazy. - Car three, what the hell do you want? - [Man] The Negroes were just in here. He took the sheriff over to test Harold Turner for powder burns. - Holy shit. Where are they? They leave here yet? - [Man] They already left. - Curse, I could never get over to Harold's in time. Wait a second, wait a second, let me see now. Hold on now, hold on. Alright I got it. Now here's what we're gonna do. (phone ringing) - Mind if I answer the phone? - Yeah, sure go ahead. - Yeah, hello. Hold on, hold on just a second, alright. I'd like to take this in the other room. Is that alright with you? - Yeah, yeah. - He's guilty as hell, Sheriff. - Still find that hard to believe. - But did you see his face when you asked to take those tests for the powder marks? - Alright Sheriff, I'm ready to be tested now. But I'd like to do it downtown where I can get me a reliable witness. Now get that lying bastard outta here. - Be a pleasure. I hope you fry, you son of a bitch. - Alright, alright, alright that's enough now. Come on, come on, come on, let's just get out in the car. Come on, come on. - What fucking gaw! I'm gonna want him arrested for giving false witness to the police, Sheriff. (funky music) - Just keep moving, no reason to get mad. - [Myrick] Sheriff, come in, Sheriff. - Alright Myrick, I'm here, what is it? - [Myrick] I got the killer cornered. I need help. - Where are you? - [Myrick] The old power plant on Smart Road. - Alright now you take it easy. I'll be right there, 10-4. Harold, I got an emergency here. Now you wait right here, don't you leave. Raymond listen, I can't take you back to town. Now you get back by yourself, you hear me? (funky music) Myrick? Myrick? Myrick? - It's me, Sheriff. Nigger lover. (gunfire pops) (funky music) - Come on, what we gonna do here? Look at that. - Dealer pull the card. - Price is going up. - Going up, huh? - Come on, come on. - Now watch this.

There's two more. - Oh! - Diamond ace. - Diamond ace in the hole. - Oh, keep your mama out of this, Ned. - $3 to you, junior. - [Junior] Fold. - Fold? To two deuces? - [Junior] To $3. - Oh come on now, fool. What's $3 to you? - [Junior] Nothing compared to what I lost already. - $3 to you, Ned. - $3? - Yeah. - $3, right. - Yeah. - Oh let me see, I fold. - [Raymond] What? (laughing) - [Junior] You jive turkey. - Just you and me, cutthroat. - Put your $2 in the pot. Put your $2 in the pot. - I'll see your damn $2. - You boys better get outta here. The Ku Klux Klan are looking for you. - That's news. - They're gonna come directly for Raymond and maybe you too. - The sheriff won't be out here looking for anybody anytime, any place. - The sheriff? The sheriff is dead. - Dead! - What are you talking about Rose? - I just saw, Rose how do you know that? - I heard Turner talking on the telephone. - Then Turner must be the one. - Right. Killed the sheriff - Or had him killed. - [Junior] And he can have us killed. - You catching on and this is gonna be the first place they gonna come looking for you, too. - Hey Dig, this isn't even a good fixed defense for us. We gonna have to get our of here where we can go into offense to them cats. - Thank you. (funky music) - Nobody move. Check out that back room. - What you want, man? - I want Raymond Moffat and his two partners. - They ain't here. - I can see that, asshole. Where are they? - I don't know. - I'm gonna have to shoot you, nigger. - Please sir, Mr. Myrick, sir, I don't know nothing. - I oughta shoot you anyway. Let's get out of here. - We appreciate y'all coming out here. Awful glad as many of you showed up as you could and as you know by the drum, we at war with the Ku Klux Klan and we need y'all's help. We don't want you to fight for us or nothing like that but we do want something that's just as important. We want you to provide us with some intelligence 'cause you never know which ones of them white folks you working for belongs to the klan. You know who be like, in the kitchen washing the dishes while Miss Annie's talking on the phone or Irvin like when you serving Mr. Frank them drinks and he's sitting out there on the back porch talking to his friends. You know his tongue gets a little bit loose and he's liable to say anything. Just keep your ears open. And then when you get all that information, just bring it all back to me and I'm gonna see to it that it gets put to some good use. 'Cause the only way we gonna be able to know what they doing and outsmart 'em is if we keep our eyes open and our ears open. - Ace, Ace, this is Rose. Old man Turner's still got it in for them boys. No, no, he don't know where they at but Ace, they gonna start some more foolishness though, Ace. - Like what? - They gonna get after the preacher. - You know when? - [Rose] This evening after supper. - How many? - [Rose] Myrick, Myrick and two more. - Myrick and two more, huh? Thanks Rose. I'll just do something about that. - Now I don't care if we have to beat this fool preacher half to death. He's gonna tell us where them boys is hiding. - It's gonna be a piece of cake. - Just be careful you don't kill him. - Well, it ain't gonna be nobody's loss. - I'm beginning to worry about the FBI. There's enough dead already. - FBI, won't they just figure that Moffat done it? - I reckon they'll figure he killed the sheriff. They'll know he didn't do in his own preacher. - Come on, let's go do it. Be quiet now. (suspenseful music) (men grunting) - They've got Winniford and now Turner's disappeared. I tell you, we gotta be more careful. I think I know how we can get to that preacher. Believe I might have to make another little visit to that boy down in nigger town. - Get on the phone, boy. Call your preacher. You tell him ifren he don't tell us where them Maffot boys is hid, I'm gonna blow your nappy head off. Move boy! - That won't be necessary, Mr. Myrick. I knows where they at. - You do? Tell me, boy. - They's down at old mad river in a old barn. - How do I get there? - You take the dry road out by Sutter Stove 'til you get to the end. Then you got about a mile, mile and a half 'fore you get to the barn. - Thank you, boy. You better be telling the truth or we're gonna have your black ass on a pole. - Your ass on the God damn pole. - Hey boy, look at me. Look at me, you slimy bastard. Now what I want to know is why you spreading around here that we's communists? - [Turner] Because it's true. - Horse shit, Turner! Winniford may be stupid enough to believe that shit but you don't believe it. - It's a good way to keep the white population scared though, isn't it, Turner and to keep yourself elected? - It's well known that communist rebel rousers go around the country-- - It's not well known. It's well rumored by cats like Turner. Where in the hell did you first hear about communist rebel rousers? From Turner? And who's private army did you fight in? Turner's you stupid son of a bitch. Do you actually believe that you can put on evil spirit costumes and call yourself dragons and burn crosses and all the darkies will shake in their shoes and afraid to fight your white supremacy? Well, these darkies are about to do you in, mother. - Harold, they-- - They're wrong, shut up. Now look here, you are dealing in kidnapping here, plain and simple. Now you think you can get away with this? - Hey, we've already got away with it. - Yeah, yeah for now. Now look here, now I can't promise nothing but if you release us, I'll do what I can. - To have us dead. You already killed the sheriff so what the hell is a couple of niggers? You already killed one for fun. - You'll be killed regardless. - You too, white boy. But first... We gonna set fire to this whole shack and then we gonna nail your balls to the floor and then I'm gonna give you a razor blade and it's either cut or burn. (laughs) Burn baby. (laughs) Burn. (laughs) - Junior, they're here. - [Junior] Alright, does everybody know what to do? (funky music) - [Man] I'm lucky I got up the hill in this thing. - [Man] That's alright, scares the hell out of the niggers. (mysterious music) (gunfire pops) - What the hell you doing, man, you missed? - I didn't miss. I shot the same one you did. Hey assholes, we got your pals in here. You shoot and you kill 'em. - Maybe we can flank 'em. Take a couple of men and move around to that side of the house. (beeping) - There's three of them coming up on our left flank. Get ready. - Get up. Listen to me, you make one more sound and I'll blow your head off. Now get up. (explosions booming) (frenzied music) (clicking) (yelling) (gunfire pops) - [Man] The niggers is high tailing it. (gunfire pops) - [Man] We got him, move up. - A little something for old Myrick. (snake hissing) - What the fuck? (ominous tones) Good God, it's Leroy. (gunfire pops) - [Man] Snake! (men exclaiming) - You think we got 'em all? (funky music) - We got 'em all. - Are you sure? (funky music) - Looks like I got the drop on two murdering niggers. Looks like they was resisting arrest. Looks like-- (gunfire pops) - [Raymond] Die nigger. (babbles) - You better hurry now, it's gonna be light soon. Yeah and the Klan's gonna be after you soon enough. - Take care. - You too, Ned. See you, Junior.
