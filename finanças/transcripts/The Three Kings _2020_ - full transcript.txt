It's a compensation at best for kids, people, who have got nothing people who've got boring jobs, live in bad houses... are wasting their lives in a system we've got in this country which I can't see changing. You've got a compensation in football You've got one thing a week where you can go and you're gonna see great excitement. You get to see drama. You're gonna see a team that you believe in. You're gonna see heroes, villains, goodies, baddies uncertainty, danger. That's fantastic, it's people's theatre. People's cinema. You're the most famous man in soccer in this country and indeed, I suppose, in the world in one sense, then again you've always... gone quietly about your business. You shun publicity in a way, don't you? And here comes the man that We would have for Prime Minister, President and everything. Matt Busby. This is the man they love. Bill Shankly. I think that a man needs... who's... who's playing in front of the public is being well paid and he doesn't dedicate himself to the job. I would be hard on him. If I could, I'd put him in jail. Out the road of society... cos he's a menace. You play a football match without fans 'you've got nothing. It can be the greatest game in the world. If there are no people there to watch it, it becomes nothing. And there is the great manager, Jock Stein. Tremendous performances by Celtic. Look at that crowd. I was born in a pitman's cottage... brought up in a faith which was football. I used to work in the pit as a boy at 14. Like everybody else, I'd come home and wash in front of the fire in a tub. Miners believe themselves to be the aristocrats of the working class. They felt superior to all other kinds of manual labourers. There was the arrogant strut of the lords of the coal face and everybody wanted to be like a miner. Kings... of the underworld. My parents, like every other boy's parents were determined that they were going to keep me out of the pits, but... it was either the pits or football and I think football was a little bit better than the pits. Working-class urban life in Scotland was the basis for the love and regard for football. Football is an art form. It's not a sport, it's an art form. I got to become a part-time player with Albion Rovers and full of ambition. I was in the pits at the time. The extra money was welcome. I had gone working in the mines to help perform. We had a visit one time from Manchester City that influenced me to sign for them. This is Matthew Busby, the right halfback. Coming down about 17 and a half and the first time coming from home. It is a big thing. Now, I knew full well... that it was only a matter of time till I got into Preston's team. And when I got in... I said to the bloke, I said, "That's you finished! You'll get no more games." For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. I was at my peak, 24 were the worst of it. Everybody was in the same boat, of course. Uit took six years of our life away, really... as players, I mean, this is the only thing I knew. I wanted to be a manager. I was hell-bent on that. My days as a player were numbered so I decided to try my hand as a manager. I didn't think that I could do it better than anyone else. But I felt I wanted to try. I happened to be in Manchester... stationed in Manchester when the Blitz came to the city and I saw Old Trafford a few days after it had been blitzed and when I looked at it, I thought Well, that's the end... there'll never be another football team here again." And it's the most amazing thing that this club, now, and this ground has risen from this. This is... this is a tribute to Matt Busby. He was still in his late teens when he left home in Lanarkshire and joined Manchester City. There he played in two successive cup finals. He moved to Liverpool for three years then six years in the army still playing football for services for various clubs and for Scotland. When he was demobbed, he was 36. For a footballer, that's late middle age. He took over the job of manager of Manchester United. Here in Manchester at Old Trafford he's known as "The Boss". When he went for his interviews he said," Listen, I don't wanna just build a football team. I wanna build a football club." All I had, apart from playing experience were certain ideas as to what a manager should do... faith in those ideas and faith in the future of the club. First of all, I look for ability. That is essential, natural ability. I love to see a player with vision. I love to see a player playing with heart... and I also, naturally, want them to be of character. I have always tried to infuse into the boys a way that they could trust me they could come to me, they could talk to me. I made them feel that anything I said would be carried out. In Matt's first season although they didn't have a ground they finished second in the league. In 1948... They won a great cup final. One of the best cup finals of all time. From the offset, I was ambitious. I came here... to put Manchester United at the top of the football tree. Matt, when you take time out and think about Manchester United what does this club of yours mean to you? It means everything to me. Why does Scotland so consistently produce skilful players? Thing is, it's the coalmines and the steel and the shipbuilding. Industrial, you know, and depressions, and... and they make possibly harder people. It's difficult to exaggerate how football's boom took off in Glasgow and its environment more than anywhere else in the world. World crowd records were always broken in Glasgow. The belief that football was... a basic ingredient in life itself in society itself. So, like, going to the church... that was football. I mean, in the tenements the Highland Clearances or earlier than that people were virtually dragooned into these towns. No facilities, hardly saw grass. So, you had to play in the back court you had to play in the street. The grimness of life here was an expression... of man's ability kicking a piece of football about. I've always felt that a... a Scottish footballer had this something which was... he was capable of creating. He was capable of controlling a ball, working a ball better. He played it in probably short spaces but they had this initial ability to be able to control and hold a ball, and work a ball. What you have to remember about football in Scotland is that it's the Scots who invented the concept of passing the ball. The origins of the game in England were in a kind of village to village kick and rush and it stayed kick and rush for a long time even when you had eleven men in a team. There was none of this big, long passing. We always seemed to play it short to play attack grid... and I think this was something that was inherent in Scotland. You know, here you are in Liverpool playing in the English first division and I don't suppose you've lost one nuance of Scottishness. You're in fact perhaps more Scottish than when you left Scotland. - Oh, yes. If Scotland went to war tomorrow I would be the first one to volunteer. Yeah. He was a hard man. Kind of gruff. We were always there at weekends. You know, me and my sister. He would love to tell us stories about Scotland where he was born and everything. To think that this place gave birth to so many footballers. It makes you realise that... that's all they had. It was a way to escape. Being from such a big family as well... five boys, five girls. I was the youngest of the boys. All of us played professional football. I think he really cherished those times. I think that sense of community really influenced him throughout his life. Your football career started humbly with Carlisle United and it was there that you went to become a manager. That was uppermost in my mind from the day I was born. To play football and to stay in it. I mean, this is the only thing I knew. And then on to Grimsby and Workington. Not exactly the glamorous parts of football. No, the outposts of the nation. Difficult. Shortage of money, couldn't buy players but we were happy. Good team, we played a lot of good football. Good experience. But whilst I was there, I knew that one day I would get somewhere else with a reasonable amount of luck. Matt might have been at Man United and Stan Cullis at Wolverhampton Wanderers but I didn't think that they were better than me because they were with big clubs. Oh, no. Parkhead wasn't always your maker really, was it? Looking a way back at your early career. What happened to get you to Celtic Park first of all, as a player? 0ł+ Celtic had a centre half problem in 1951 ı through injury.0łAthrough injury. When I got word that Celtic were interested in me I didn't believe it at the time. You would never have dreamed of that. Never dreamed of playing for Celtic. He was a Protestant. For all the talk of division in our society it's nothing like the world in which they grew up. It's nothing like as violent. The cause of this violence... was sectarianism. Fighting between Protestants and Catholics. Growing up in Lanarkshire in Ayrshire and in that industrial belt there were riots involving thousands on both sides. The Catholic immigrants who'd come in the early part of the 20th century identified with Celtic. Rangers was identified with the Church of Scotland the Protestantism, the free masonry and that was a divide that, by and large, was very, very hard to cross. After I joined Celtic, maybe I lost one or two... people that, uh... I used to have normal relationships with nodding to and speaking to and maybe even pals with some of them... they more or less kind of dropped me. He hated bigotry from any side. You know, just stupid thinking you could have put it most aptly. When he was winching Jean he had to sort of dodge in and out, as if the... the CIA were after him. I mean, it was incredible when you think back on it... because she was a Catholic. This was the genesis of him beginning to sort out the absurdities... of division and sectarianism. When I come here I laid tremendous emphasis on the fact that we were gonna try and build our own players. Thus began the legend of the "Busby Babes". One question that everybody always asked Matt Busby was this... How do you find these boys? Well, I'd say, Bill, I have a scouting system whose sole objective is to go out looking for young, promising schoolboys youth club boys, and indeed any young players who have the necessary natural ability to ever make a future Manchester United player. Having won the championship in '52 he took a drastic, and some people thought... decidedly stupid step. He almost totally replaced the old team With a new team, a younger one. It was his dream to build a youth team. The experience he had as a footballer himself there was no encouraging youth. And he said to himself Right, if I get a manager's job this is what I'm going to do." lt was a tremendously happy time to a boy who had come to this club from leaving school and you get a tremendous kick out of a boy coming through and making himself a top-class player. We had so much talent about the place. Roger then was the captain, and Sammy Taylor. Dennis Viollet, and of course the great, great Duncan Edwards. Edwards was incomparable at his age. I have never seen a more accomplished player at his age. Never. Duncan Edwards was a young player of such phenomenal scale power and ability. But he wasn't the only one. There was a kid up in the North East. He lived in Ashington a Mining community in Northumberland called Robert Charlton. Rob Jones, Duncan Edwards... Billy Whelan, all the same digs, all together, yeah. It was great, it was paradise. And I think a lot of that is down, really, to Sir Matt because he let everybody know that everyone in the club was as important as anyone else. At that time, you had to get a paper signed that he was my legal guardian. In other words, he was my second father and he treated me like a son. Was your father a miner? He was, yes. Now, he went to the war he was killed when you were six years old. You were the only male Busby left, weren't you in the whole of the family? He Carried that paternal attitude throughout his football career. We lived with them, nurtured them we watched them, we looked after them, they were coached. You become a sort of family. Edwards, through to Viollet. Now, there's a chance for United. They represented the best of What football could be in Britain. They played with a spring in their step with a kind of lightness. That somehow communicated itself. There's something about that Busby Babes side. They're a group of young mates or young blokes. The austerity of the 50's after the war is still causing grey skies over a country, in a way... and suddenly there's these brylcreem boys. That deep white V-neck on the United kit really does give you shivers. It's about a youth culture and about "we can do our own thing we don't need to be told by the establishment what to do" and they were playing football that hadn't been seen and they were all teenagers. Unbelievable. The beginnings of post-war youth culture. The rebirth of sort of swaggering youth. It was even young boys, 19 years old... we were winning English league championships by eleven points. Busby always believed that football was a gift. Everything about Manchester United... expectations, traditions... what Manchester United has produced, as a club... all of that goes back to Matt Busby and his belief that the public must be entertained. I was fairly good in the air, nothing more. I was good in the air, and at that time Celtic needed someone there and good players round about me. As a player in the dressing room... always argumentative... and he could argue football. He was always keen to better himself. He was very knowledgeable about the game. He ate and slept football. He'd played in low-grade football up until then. Indeed, Llanelli was non-league... and here he was given the opportunity of leadership. Suddenly a team that didn't look like a team became a team. We won the league and the cup in 1953 and 4. We won the Coronation Cup. At one time, we were a pretty good side and we went into deeper aspects of football and then we were playing it. Then I thought that... once I was finished I would like to take a place in football. Jock Stein wanted to be a manager of a football club. No question at all about that. Stein and Shankly and Busby were men of such strong character and convictions. They looked outside their own little worlds for inspiration and for worlds to conquer. In The case of managers in England they had to fight the FA in Order to be allowed to play in Europe. Matt did things that people below him couldn't possibly do. You know, his negotiations, the decisions that he made about us going to play in Europe and the Football League was saying, "You can't do this". Well, he made decisions like that that nobody below him could possibly do, you know. And he took chances. He took chances, but he knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to be the best. He didn't just want to be the best in England he wanted to be the best in the world. So, Europe was an adventure that we had to be part of. We'd all settled into a pattern of playing which meant that we were gonna have many years of success. We're the best club side I've seen in Britain. Manchester United's exploits in the European Cup... partly because they were televised... conspired in this process of the Busby Babes becoming national property. The Munich air crash. The aircraft is a twin-engined Elizabethan on charter from BEA. It was returning from Belgrade where Manchester United had entered the semi-final of the European Cup. It had reached Munich and were just taking off for home, in poor weather when the crash came at three o'clock. This is Old Trafford. Today, it's the heart of a mourning city. Everybody in Manchester, everybody in Britain, nearly is looking to the sun. The one question that's in everybody's mind is how is Matt Busby getting along. Duncan Edwards, injured. Bill Foulkes, injured. Matt Jones, killed. Ray Wood, injured. Eddie Colman, killed. David Pegg, killed. Dennis Viollet, injured. Tommy Taylor, killed. Roger Byrne, killed. Bill Whelan, killed. John Berry, injured. At the time of going to press Matt Busby was fighting for his life. I was walking along on in front about ten yards in front of my mum and saw this old man in an oxygen tent. He looked grey. I thought, "Oh, that poor so-and-so." And then it shook me, "It's my dad!" I felt each time I came around I didn't want to live. I wanted to die. For a man of such devout Catholicism to say that... is an extraordinary statement and a measure of how grief-stricken how guilt-stricken... he must have been at that time. After two weeks, Duncan Edwards died. When he signed a player he made sure that the parents knew that he was gonna look after them and suddenly this had happened. You can imagine... I can't ever imagine how he handled it. He must have been really strong, mentally as well as physically. It was, Jean, his wife who, in a way... saved Matt Busby's Manchester United because he absolutely could not bear the thought of football. But she said "Matt, you've got to come round" and he said "Why, what does it matter?" My mother turned round to him and said Matt, them boys would like you to carry on. Carry on again. Remember these lads through building another team". You owe it to the families of those who were killed and to the boys that have survived". He eventually came to believe that that was his duty. Through an ankle injury in 1957... I gave up the game and I had to come back and another aspect of the game I was put in charge of Celtic young players. It gave me, first, the chance to control players and gave me a chance to have... a deeper look at the tactical side of the game. I was just starting to emerge as a young footballer. I, of course, came up with Celtic reserves for a bit when Jock was starting to take a backroom role at Celtic. His reputation was gathering among the players. He had a vision that was different from coaches of his time. I had gone as far as I would expect to go at a club like Celtic, you know. I was a non-Catholic, and maybe they felt that... maybe I wouldn't achieve the job as manager but I moved out to try and prove that I could be a manager. I didn't think that I could do it better than anyone else but I felt I wanted to try. He hit the town like a tornado, to be honest and he just moulded us into a team. Dunfermline's first glimpse of The team with the Scottish Cup. I do my best for them off the field. I expect the same from them on the field. I think that the real success that I found, if any is because I've treated each player with respect and got his respect in return. Are you a disciplinarian? To a certain extent, yes, I would say so but, uh... I come and go of that properly. I'm supposed to be hard, but I'm probably softer than most of them. Through the years, I've listened to wonderful talkers of the game. Wonderful analyser. But he wouldn't be able to get a player stand up to his feet when he came into a room. That kind of instant reaction. When he went to Hibs and played that famous game against Real Madrid when we beat them 2-0... I mean, with Hibs, he won the Summer Cup. It was unheard of. !it was actually Celtic who were beginning, really, to take a serious interest in him. They couldn't ignore this man who was told he could only be a reserve coach. Shankly was no stranger to disillusion in management. He'd been disillusioned in Workington. He'd been disillusioned at Huddersfield, in the end. I had players like Law and Wilson. Now, Law and Wilson go down as two of the greatest players in the history of football. I never met anybody like him in my life. I thought, you know, he must be from another world. All he did was talk about football. He made you believe you were something special. I had fantastic potential at Huddersfield but it was a seller's market and I didn't want to be involved in that. '59, early in the season October... we were playing at Huddersfield town and two people came from this club walked down the slope and asked me if I'd go to Liverpool. It was as blunt as that. It was Matt who recommended Liverpool get Bill Shankly as manager, in the first place. He said," Well, look, the guy at Huddersfield, Bill Shankly I think you should go and try to get him". Matt and Bill actually played together during the war in Wartime Internationals for Scotland. I think Bill had always looked up to Matt and knew they came from the same sort of background but that's when they really hit off the friendship. The funny thing about it is I said to them after the match l said, "I'm glad you stopped scoring goals, you know?" Oh, I see. It's like that. - And I was boiling. I thought they'd score another ten, you know? Maybe like an older brother, younger brother relationship. Matt very much sort of understood Bill's tenacious hot-headedness, sometimes. I came here because I'd been to Liverpool. I knew that the potential was here. The crowd was here and that was the chance I was looking for. The same kind of people as me, and the people in Glasgow. Liverpool and Glasgow are similar. They think the same as I do, and I think the same as they do. Liverpool was in the Second Division then? Oh, yeah. They had a poor team to put it bluntly. I came here because of the people because I knew there was a public for the game. Bob Paisley, Ronnie Moran, Joe Fagan was here Reuben Bennett. Now, they were there long before I came. And, normally, a manager goes to a new club he takes his own men with him. Well, I didn't. I said," I know something about the game in training, as well and we'll all work together. I'll lay the system down... and then maybe one day, we'll get the players we need." And that exactly happened. Two outstanding players came up in Scotland. One was the gigantic centre half of Dundee United, Ron Yeats the other was the very crafty, deep-lying centre-forward of a very fine Motherwell team. His name was Ian St John. Shankly demanded the money to get those two players and this time, the deals were done. Yeats and St John joined Liverpool and Shankly, from then on built the Liverpool dynasty that, well... was eventually to become Manchester United's nemesis. I wasn't well for the best part of three years I would say, before I really recovered. Got my real strength back. It was the essential reality of time and, of course when things are not going right the respect of how things have been or how things have gone beforehand... you always get people who are ready to shout Time he was out. Why did we do this, why did you sign that?" But, uh... I went along knowing full well that we're going in the right line. Manchester United's scout seen me playing for Cregagh and invited me for trials with Manchester United... and, uh... at first, when I went over I only stayed a couple of days and I was homesick and came back home but my father, he had a talk with Matt Busby and, uh, he decided to give me another chance. So I went back and stayed since then. They used to come home say, on a Friday, and he'd picked the team and he'd be upset because he'd left somebody out and so forth, and he used to always discuss it with my mum you know, and, uh... she used to say, "Well you always do the right thing". And here they come. I think, yes, here they come. There they are, Matt Busby on the right. To rebuild from... the basis of such devastation... not just in terms of the number of people killed but the psychological effect of it, surviving that accident and to use that as the... in a way, the kind of mould force for... regeneration. That showed enormous strength of character... singleness" of purpose. He must have had great human qualities to recreate something from that. Look at the results that Manchester United have achieved. I don't think there's anything that he's short of. He's never been short of courage to go and buy players with his own money not sponsored by anybody. Money that came through the turnstiles and he never was afraid to dabble. He didn't care what Law cost. He wanted Law. Manchester United had the fab three... Law, Best and Charlton. The great entertainers. Well now, here we've got the man himself Matt Busby, well done, Matt. Thank you, David. - Marvellous. Oh, wonderful, wonderful. I must say, two years we've stood behind this net and said, "hard luck". Yes, yes, that's the way it's been going but the boys have turned it on today, and have been a wonderful tonic for me. Just as we thought that Welsh international rugby crowds were the most musical and passionate in the world but I've never seen anything like this Liverpool crowd. The Duke of Wellington, before the Battle of Waterloo said of his own troops I don't know what they do to the enemy but by God, they frighten me." As soon as he went to Liverpool he went straight in and appealed to the people to harness the power of the community the power of the support. They contribute everything to Liverpool. I mean, that's my sole aim. To give them something worth seeing to give them success. They are the ones that come through the turnstiles and pay the money. When a manager does this... if there's a bond... an unshakeable bond between the crowd and the manager... the players have nowhere to go. They weren't even allowed to be injured. On a Saturday, I'm prepared to... to die for these people. When the crowd start chanting, and then, you know... you feel ten feet tall, you... you want to do everything. 'Well, The Kop's exclusive... the Spion Kop at Liverpool, is an institution and if you're a member of The Kop, you feel as If you're a member of a big society where you've got thousands of friends all round about you. And they're united and loyal. He came out of that room you were thinking, "How many is it gonna be this week?" We proved, conclusively that we at Liverpool... had a team unit that all helped each other. So, by playing collectively, they've got individual honours. Football is socialism if you'd like to call it. We prayed for each other. I think the fact that you beat us here in the cup was responsible for us winning the league. Yes, it's true. But still, you did well a great side you've got. You deserve it, mate. I'm happy about it, Tommy... When he'd become manager I had problems with him because he was always... fighting me every inch of the way and we arrived at a situation where... Bill Shankly was a danger to us. Shankly's teams were, you know, tough. Even before, with strong men. Watch it, watch it, watch it. He hewed his team from granite if you like. It was very different from Manchester United. Busby seemed to mould his from clay. Different ways of expressing the truths of football. Best is onside. And the experience of Old Trafford and Anfield you know, expresses the difference between the two clubs. Liverpool fans set up something that intimidates a visiting team in a different sort of way. It's an implacable support. It really is a twelfth man for the team in a way that the Old Trafford crowd isn't. The Old Trafford crowd is more likely to sit back and enjoy what it's watching. Expressive of the two men who really formed their characters... Busby at Old Trafford, and Shankly at Anfield. You would look at those two men and look at those two grounds and the crowds within them, and you'd say Yes, that's perfect". You know, one is an expression of one and the other. That's very interesting, I think. To live through a time when the soul of something is being created... and it's a soul that... assumes a kind of permanence. The great rivalry of the two cities those football cities owes everything, pretty much, to Busby and Shankly. La-la, la La-la, la La-la, la La-la, la When people ask me what love's all about There's one thing I can say Some people believe just what I'm putting down Understand your troubles away You got to do this thing we're feeling You got to know just what I'm meaning Gotta believe just what I'm handing Understanding Understanding Understanding Alright, girl! - La-la, la La-la, la La-la, la La-la, la All these things took time. Went to Europe, found out things in Europe. It Was a hydrogen bomb all in little packets that they put together and poof! It was a big bomb. I'm wondering whether there's anything left really, for you to prove. I've always been European Cup conscious. I still want Manchester United to be the best team in Europe. You see I love this life I live And I want to love it with you But people you don't understand I Just what I'm putting down There's no more I can do You got to do this thing we're feeling You got to know just what I'm meaning Gotta to believe just what I'm handing Understanding Understanding Oh, yeah Come on, keep on moving La-la, la When the chance to come to Celtic did arise which naturally is a big, big call to anyone I had played here. The club weren't doing very well and I just thought that if I could achieve for Celtic what I'd achieved for Hibs, I'd be doing a good job for them. What I wanted to do was to prove to the people I was capable of taking full control and I came on the basis of that. It wasn't long till we got there. I liked his intelligence... Stein's personality. He would look you straight in the eye and tell you when he thought you were wrong. And that's what he did with the board. He could handle people. We always thought that when he came to Parkhead there would be an auction... just casting out players left, right and centre. That didn't happen. ŁHe was very, very clever and very astute in the early days, because he recognised immediately what he had. He didn't try to disrupt it, he didn't try to fill our heads with a load of nonsense. He just wanted us to express ourselves. This is one of his... real strong points. He knows how you feel, him being a footballer. He knows what it means to be beaten in a cup final. This can be a year that everyone else can remember so, let's make sure that each player helps each other. Make sure if somebody's having a bad game somebody near him helps him. He was a sympathetic man. I think his background was something that stood him in great stead. He never lost sight of the fact that he was working class. It was always to remember the people in the terrace were important, because you had to give them something in turn, you had to give a bit of flair a bit of excitement, a bit of endeavour. It was like a breath of fresh air him coming back as manager. It's Gallacher... and a wonderful goal by McNeill! The team had been in quite a number of finals and semi-finals before that and never got the breakthrough of winning something. That year, we won the cup. The goal which would win the Scottish Cup for Celtic for the first time in eleven years. I think that was a key moment when we won the cup that day. On that particular occasion, it broke a barrier for lots of players. At that time... Celtic really was subjugated by Rangers. They had to, if you like replace Rangers as the dominant club. It took 'em back to animosity. It took 'em back to the bewildering sectarianism... and then he was there to dispel that. Doesn't matter which game it was... Glasgow Charity Cup final. This was his big game, always. Nobody at that stage... would've seen nine years in advance... to go on that stretch of success. It was such an expressive team. It had great players drawn from within 30 miles of their ground. That was such an extraordinary thing in every way. Jimmy Johnson was a kind of key for a lot of people. He was the figure that everybody could latch on to. And if the team provided a platform for a player like that then the manager was doing something right. All in all, the success comes from this feeling of everyone working with each other everyone helping each other and everyone playing for their club. I think like every other club, the European Cup must be... everyone in Scotland's ambition... whereas no Scottish team has ever reached the final, even. And, uh, I think this is a big dream. I think it'd be a tremendous performance for any club to do so. We had almost done everything possible in Scottish football, that year. We were going to Lisbon as the first Scottish side to actually play in the European Cup final. We had absolutely nothing to lose. We weren't supposed to be there. We were Glasgow Celtic, I mean... who had heard of Glasgow Celtic? We'll go there... very, very conscious of the fact we're playing for Celtic Football Club... but we have always been conscious of the fact that we're also playing for Scotland. I was the only manager of an English club that was there. None of them took the trouble to go there and they hadn't seen the Celtic and I had, of course. The funny thing about it is Inter didn't have a lot of spectators there. Celtic had far more than them. Celtic must have carried 15 or 16,000 people with them which is... was a terrific thing... and I think all the Portuguese were supporting Celtic. Can Celtic become not only the first Scottish the first British, but the first non-Latin team to win the European Cup? For the rest of Europe a virtually unknown team to be playing the great Inter in this final. Celtic now, led by Billy McNeill. There's Jock Stein, on the right. You know, that was a time when... you had this champion club and it was being won by great teams, you know? Inter Milan, Benfica... Real Madrid won the first five editions of it. And so, the number eight that's away we go for the twelfth European Cup final. Cappellini... A penalty! He tripped him. It's a penalty. It's a penalty. Yes, 1-0 for Inter! One goal down with exactly seven and a half minutes gone. A tragedy. Celtic was a superior team after that goal was scored. On the front foot all the time hadn't lost their confidence the agility of the players the elasticity of the playing... You felt a goal was inevitable. Oh, wait that's a wonderful save! Oh, a great shot by number three, Gemmell. One goal to nil. Inter are leading a goal up with seven minutes from the penalty spot by Mazzola. Well, thank you very much, Ken and a heart-breaking game not only for Celtic supporters but for all those who cherish attacking football. Inter are the very dictation of this. Celtic and all these men aren't just taking on Inter they're trying to end the ice age Of defensive European football. Clipped to Craig... Murdoch... At last, to Murdoch... In comes Craig... He's scored a great goal! He's done it! I'm never fully confident and I always look it... if third place players are capable of playing, they'll win against any side. Five minutes left now... one goal each. Gemmell... Murdoch... A goal! Celtic have scored! Free when I dance with you We move like the sea You, you're all I want to know I feel free I feel free I feel free I can walk down the street, there's no one there I was in the dressing room after the game because I remember Jock, he was... He'd just came out of the bath. He Was sweating as much as the players and I said, "Jock, you're immortal now". Though my mind wants to cry out loud Dance floor is like the sea Ceiling is the sky You're the sun and as you shine on me I feel free I feel free I feel free Ah Ah Jock, I am delighted at having the privilege of making this presentation to you. And not only for bringing the European Cup back to Scotland for the first time but to Great Britain, as well. May I extend to you, Jock the directors and your players and your staff sincere congratulations on a great performance. Thank you very much, Matt. It gives us great pleasure to accept this trophy. Not only on behalf of the club but on behalf of Scottish football. It's good to see us there and being the first team, not only a British team but a Scottish team to win this trophy. And, naturally, I'm quite sure they have the good wishes of the Celtic football club... the players, and Scottish football. We hope that the next hands the European Cup are in are yours. Thank you very much. Everybody was desperate for United to win the European Cup. You know, a team had died trying to win it. And for them to win it seemed to be the most appropriate tribute to what Busby had achieved in the years after Munich. Of course, they were strong loyalties, allegiances... but I can't imagine there was a football fan in England who didn't want Manchester United to win the European Cup. Just a couple of hours ago at the start of what's been described as the greatest European Cup Final of all time. Wembley is beginning to become ablaze with the red and white colours of Manchester United supporters. For Manchester United manager, Matt Busby this moment stands on the threshold of a dream. A dream of leading the first English club ever to capture the European Cup. As soon as we won in Madrid at the semi-final, and we were through to the sign-off there was no way that they'd beat us. I think the crowd, and the atmosphere and the whole history of the event... you know, it would mean that we would win it. The parents, the old players that were injured that couldn't play anymore were there and it was very emotional for the club. At Wembley, United were the favourite. This was the most extraordinary... redemption. Everybody felt anxiety... tension, nervousness... you know, could they win the European Cup? Manchester United... Oh, and he's hit the bar! Keep up with him, make him run on the left. This is not what we expected. Sadler, Charlton, a goal! He scored! Charlton has scored! It's a goal by Graca. Unmarked in the middle... there's Eusebio! Oh, well saved. The whistle goes for the end of 90 minutes. The second time in the history of the European Cup that there has been extra time. It was a good job I went back and forced myself to go back. I got this obsession again that Manchester United were going to the top. Now Best... oh, he's gonna... Oh, he's gone, he has! Now it's a goal! Charlton... He's got another! It is! It's all over! Manchester United has done it! This, basically, was a culmination of everything. This was something you'd striven for you'd fought for. We've done it. We've done it for, you know... We've done it for him because he... he was Manchester United. Good morning, everyone. So, Matt has informed the board that he wishes to relinquish the position of Team Manager at the end of the present season. The chairman and directors have tried to persuade him to carry on and it was only with great reluctance that his request has been accepted. When I go over... twenty-three years of strife, strain... uh, it's a long time, and after all, again when you get to my age, fifty-eight passing. It's time to, I feel, for young team managers to come in and deal with the problems of team selections and all things now pertaining to the club. The public, people don't ever realise what a manager suffers in one big match. A manager's living and every match is a dread. You fear the worst sometimes you're looking for snow and it's not falling. You're always frightened of the next game because you're frightened that your players don't perform to the way they should perform and that always gives you worry. You see, games where you should win is the most difficult to motivate people. The strain is terrible. I mean, you're working for your club you're working for the public... and if you're in the big time it's very, very difficult. You feel the strain in your job too, you know. Now, it may be that we feel the strain a little more. Since I come here to Liverpool and to Anfield... I have drummed it into our players... time and again... that they are privileged to play for you. And if they didn't believe me... they believe me now. Now, you're a little bit like Matt Busby you can seem to build one championship side and then you can build another. You did it in the mid-60's. You won the title twice, you won the FA Cup. It seems now that you've built another side. Is this going to be a better team than the great teams we've had then? If I keep on improving, that could happen. Oh, yeah. More excitement. Oh, yeah. Exciting players and doing things making things happen. I don't plague Kevin Keegan with the Bible every day, with the gospel. He is in the pack with the rest, not individually. The gospel of how to live... how to be an athlete. What to do... both as a man and as a player, and all. Liverpool were, at their best, a machine. A fantastically well-functioning attacking machine. Somehow, you know, the whole team is geared to forward movement. We're clawing at the idea you've conquered the bloody world. You know it. And that's what I wanted, that Liverpool would be untouchable. It wasn't often beautiful... It's still there to be had, and it's taken! Except in its effect. You know, when you see a machine working that well... even if the machine's function is not to create beauty it's effect can be beautiful. It's an art, it's a trade and if you don't know it, then you'll fall by the wayside. You could be lucky, you could win something you could be in and you could be out. But Liverpool's in for 15 years of consistency. It's not a myth, it's not just an accident. It's all they've done, the plans are there. If a manager... is honest and he has this natural enthusiasm I think whilst you can't go into the field with the players you can convey it to the players, you understand? He's with them, and they're with him and they'll be successful. I mean, every player that comes here from the day he steps in here, the minute he steps in here he's being watched... he's being scrutinised. Then we're reading him like a book. Then in a month's time, we know everything about him all his weaknesses and all his strengths. So, from the day he comes in here if he thinks we'll not be watching him he's got a surprise coming to him. Whether you're a good player or whether you're a bad one doesn't make any difference. If you're a good man, then we'll help you. And out comes the trophy which is awarded to the league champions already bearing the red colours of Liverpool. And now the salute for the champions and for Bill Shankly who takes off his jacket to reveal the characteristic red shirt. This is the man they like. And this great communion between players and supporters all one now for the great day in the history of Liverpool football. That's where the heart of Liverpool football beats. Why do you think that Liverpool has such fanatical fans? Why do they follow the team so closely? I believe it's because they identify with the manager. The character of the manager goes through to the players and it goes through to the fans as well. I'm just one of the people that stands in the Kop. They think the same as I do, and I think the same as they do. Toshack, Keegan, one-nil. Hughes... Vogts... Toshack, Keegan, two-nil! And it's all over, and Liverpool have won the UEFA Cup. They have come on so tremendously through the whole of that second half. Their first venture, conquest in Europe after nine years of strife. Today, I feel prouder than I've ever felt before. We played for you... because it's you we play for. And it's you who pay our wages. George Best you've had a night to think about it are you still definitely quitting football? Yes, definitely, yeah. I've made the decision and that's it, then. And how do you feel about the dismissal of Mr O'Farrell, along with you? Well, it's always sad for anyone to lose any sort of job. It's unfortunate. He came, did the best he could. The board made their decision and that's it. Frankly, George, do you think at all that you are responsible for the position which Manchester United are in now in the relegation zone of the first division? Uh... well, I don't know, from what I've read and seen whether I'm in or out of the team it was always my fault, so... It's perfectly understandable when someone has such a pervasive, powerful and positive influence on an institution like Manchester United that when that figure disappears there's something big missing. Busby cast such a huge shadow and I'm sure he wouldn't have wanted to do that. Just too much for the person brought in. None of them could replace what he had represented to the club. Turning to you now, Mr Stein, how do the team feel now that... There was an attempt to bring Jock Stein who was obviously big enough for Manchester United. He was at a match at Liverpool. On the way, we had arranged to meet and I suggested a time we'd love him to come to Old Trafford. He shook hands with Matt Busby and said, "I'll be taking the job". All of a sudden, he decided probably... he might be better staying in Scotland. He was always a home bird. He's gripped by the soil of north Lanarkshire and the place he'd been born and brought up in. Busby couldn't believe it. Matt, aren't you getting a little bit tired of having to bail Manchester United out? I'm getting a bit tired of a lot of things, Barry. I, uh... thought when I gave the managership up over three and a half years ago that I was gonna get a bit of peace and contentment. This is the second time I've had to come in to fill a gap until an appointment was made. It is of course because of your experience that you've been asked by the board to take over again. -: Yes. Do you accept that in, in some way, this... this must be an inhibiting effect on those who are trying to succeed you? I don't interfere, I go along with it. I... I could never understand why all this is put that I am... as if I was interfering. But they're your players or some of the senior players are your players. To them, you will always be boss. He couldn't walk away... for several years after he stepped down as manager. Matt was still bringing transfers in but he was also a signing board for disaffected players. I don't particularly wanna play football in England again. Why? - I don't know. I was just a little bit sick generally of England. So I'm looking for something else to do. I don't want to embarrass my family by becoming a millstone you know, if you know what I mean. Next season, it could possibly happen that... that I wasn't able to command a first team place. What a cross for Law! Denis has done it! There was a certain culpability in the end and it ended with Manchester United relegated. I've had opportunities to move. Good opportunities to move. Moves that would have been better financially to me but I've got ties here, I've got ties... l've got my home here, and my family prefer to be here. But the most important tie here is that... I like to be manager of Celtic and I like the people I'm working with. It's as simple and straight-forward as that. I like the players I'm working with... the directors I work with are very good as well so I've got no complaints. And the most important thing is I like the people who support us. I like to see them getting a bit of success. And I'm egotistical enough to think that if I'm here we'll have reasonable success anyway. May be wrong in that, but I'm quite happy with it. My friends say it's fine, friends say it's good Everybody says, it's just like a rock 'n' roll should I'm not just part of Celtic, Celtic is part of me. I go to work and we'll talk about the game. After the game this Saturday, we discuss it. Monday, we discuss it. Tuesday, we discuss it. Just football, football, all the time. There's nothing different, nothing more. Just Celtic. Celtic is us, and we are Celtic. Well, it's plain to see you were meant for me I'm your boy, your 20th century toy Friends say it's fine, my friends say it's good Everybody says it's just like rock 'n' roll should now It got to a point where he says," Well... this team's had enough". Gemmell went, Wallace went, Auld went, Murdoch went. Everyone, Dalglish, Macary... Hay, McGrain, you know, and still kept going. Glasgow Celtic is the most successful football club in the world. I hope they can dispute that. What about Ajax, Benfica, teams like that? Well, they haven't won nine successive leagues. Celtic's nearly certain to win the league nine successive times. And they've been in the league cup ten successive years, final. I mean, who can do that? They won the European cup and they've been in there and all that and they've played all the teams. They've beaten Leeds United three times out of three. So, he's just a natural champion. What about this business, you know, being a manager in English football where, I don't know what the figures are... Nine hundred, pardon me... I've been dismissed around the things since the war, possibly. Nervous business. Nervous? I'd say. I'll tell you there's only one worse job being a debt collector in Glasgow. I think he realised what people expected or wanted, or what would grab people's attention and he would play to that. He'd modelled himself a bit on Cagney, you know that's how he saw himself. The trilby and the long mac. That sort of swagger and everything was a bit of a show. He was like the pied piper there would be people following him crowds around him wherever he went. And he wanted to be surrounded. That was his lifeline, I think. There is one of the most talked about men Bill Shankly. And it looks as though the moment has arrived you have seen them before the one 100,000-crowd has seen them. But now, the whole of Wembley... is tense and ready to greet two teams who've fought their way to this 1974 cup final and now they see them. How d'you feel about the news today? What news? - That Shankly's retired. Retired? - What? If that's true, then... - It's true. I swear it's the truth. Honestly, I'm not joking, it's real. Are you having us on? He has in fact seriously retired honestly, I tell you. Tell you no lie. I mean, it's a shock to everybody. How do... it must be a shock It's a shock to you! You don't believe me. - What's happened, is he sick? No, he's not sick he's... what? - He wouldn't leave. He's left! You mean he's retired, honestly? Give us a paper. I've always been led by my conscience. I don't know what happened, but this was a... a thing that happened to me all of a sudden. I felt that I had won battles which all managers have in football, and always will have and that... that I was... in a position whereby... I was made a little bit complacent. But I had won the battles and I felt I would go out on us winning. If it's come to you as a surprise and to the people of Liverpool I mean, I'm sorry for that because, I mean, they are... the same as me. I mean, I came to Liverpool, that made me and I helped to make Liverpool. Bill, you haven't won the European Cup. You've won everything else, but I mean... are there ambitions left unrealised for you? Don't you feel that there are still things to win? Oh, I think so, cos I think I was the best manager in the game and I should've won more. Yeah. But why... why wouldn't you go on? I didn't do anything with devious ways. I mean, I would fight with you and would break your... break my wife's leg if I played against her. But I wouldn't cheat her. Football is perhaps more important to you than to any other manager that runs in the game in England. I mean, are you turning your back on football or not? No. You're not worried about the possibility of a repeat of the Manchester United situation the hangover of Sir Matt Busby or anything like that. I mean, if a new man comes in, he will have free reign. I mean, have you thought about... - Well, if a new man comes in then I would be out. When he left Liverpool I don't quite think he knew what he was doing. I think he knew he was leaving Liverpool but I don't think he knew how it would affect him. He was a man of few words at home. My nan didn't like football. She didn't wanna go to football matches. Yeah. It was almost like an intrusion. Even though it was family time football was always there. The phone was always ringing. You could hear him talking football. I can't remember anybody who wasn't connected with football ever coming round to the house. People don't believe me, they say, "Oh, there must have been a downside, there must've", no there wasn't. He was obsessed. It's difficult living with somebody like that. He'd get up in the morning, and he'd have no purpose in his life. He'd go down, first of all, which he did. He went down to the training ground at Liverpool, and of course the lads are calling him boss. Bob is there, he's the boss. You know, and there was a lot of conflict, uh... and it wasn't right, so he had to be told in a nice way Bill, it'd be better if you... if you never went down the training ground. He'd put on his tracksuit and he'd wander round the Everton ground to talk to them cos it's right over the fence from his garden. Bill, is your wife gonna like it now that you've retired? Is she gonna get worried about your restlessness? I think she's a little bit worried. I think she thinks I'm sorry that I've retired. Are you sorry you... - She feels a lot of sympathy. In a sense, I feel sometimes that way but I don't regret it, no. But I think so. He did try to make up, I think for the fact that with his own children he was a bit of an absent figure. You know, my mum always did say to me You see him more than I ever did when I was growing up." I don't know if my nan just thought, "Oh, well everything will just be normal now, we'll be just like a normal family" but that's not how it turned out. And he couldn't because that was all he really cared about. Yes, he'd made a decision but he hadn't taken into account what that decision would do to him. That's not being overdramatic. I don't think he ever got over not being manager of Liverpool. Jock Stein loved the Celtic supporters. Not everybody inside Celtic park had that rapport with him. He was Protestant. Because of his background some people simply didn't like him and he felt there was just that... lingering thing among certain elements... about him. The loss of Kenny Dalglish in August of 1977 meant that Celtic were diminished. The thing about football supporters is they have a very short memory. Celtic had been a dominant force throughout the Scottish game a big name in the European table, as well. And now, that was going away. We move into an era where the likes of Dalglish and Macari can get such huge money in England that that's where they go and they go to Manchester United and Liverpool. The manager is a very, very specialised profession that in ten years' success and industry would have a very, very high position in that industry. In football, you have ten years success you're actually more insecure the eleventh year than you are in the previous ten. His time, probably, was up. I think he felt, to a certain extent, that himself. He was offered really meaningless things to stay on the board, which he couldn't accept. His family felt very, badly hurt about it. You're asking one of the greatest names in world football to start selling things for you. It was a problem because Jock dominated everybody and therefore, we've got a new manager and it was felt that Jock should sort of hang back for a little while. When eventually he had to go like any... abdication... there's regret. Billy McNeil, of course, was the heir apparent. You know, the king is dead, long live the king. Where there is discord may we bring harmony. Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt may we bring faith and where there is despair, may we bring hope. In the 1970s, the mood of the proletarian audience had changed. Violence and division was in the air. The civil war... between the declining industries was notably mining and the forces of law and order. That caused a lot of fear and loathing in society. I think the game has lost a bit of its charm. Bastards! Where there's men and there's, uh... somebody's got to win and somebody's got to lose somebody's gonna lose their temper. We managed to chase people away from the game. We're not concerned with tickets we're not concerned how many people are at the match but we're concerned that we've got a trouble-free game Jon the terrace, and that's the most important thing. There was a lot of talk about society being fractured. These three great men were educated in interdependence community, and it bound them together in a way that people growing up today just would not understand. It was playing, it was for pride and for the people, of course. Now it's money, money, money. What is a football club, but a community? The creations of Stein, Shankly and Busby became the good old days. Well, everything I got out of football I owe to football and the dedication and what I put into the game. You only get out of the game what you put into it and I put everything into it I could and still do. For the people and the people that I was playing for and the people that I was manager for. I didn't cheat them out of anything. So, I put all my heart and soul to the extent that my family suffered. Do you regret that at all? Yeah, I regret it very much. Yeah. Somebody said that football's a matter of life and death to you. I said, "Listen, it's more important than that". Until Bill Shankly came to this city football was a joke and he... well, he was Liverpool and the fans thought a hell of a lot of him. Along with the Beatles, I guess. You know... Bill Shankly is the kind of bloke who brought life back to Merseyside. He's a sort of man you never thought would die. You just imagine the world to go on and on. You honestly thought that he would be there when no one else was left. We were very, very good friends. Very close friends over many years. He laid the foundation there. Deep down, the greatest satisfaction was taking Liverpool into the position they're now in. We were in a city that was... where the potential was brilliant which, of course, is proven to be... Gone from strength to strength. So many years have passed since he died it almost feels as if the legacy and the legend has grown. You can feel, everywhere there is something of his legacy. I was the manager, I picked the team. I did a lot of things in Liverpool but they were more important than me, really. Everything I did was for the people and to make them proud because this is their life. At the end of the day, when he died... I feel that he died of a broken heart... because football was his life. Was there a lot more pressure being manager of Scotland than there was being manager of Celtic? There's no doubt that there's more people want you to be. To have something to say about the Scottish team and did. Some people are quite happy when a team like Celtic or Rangers go down but everyone in Scotland more or less wants to see them do well. But, at the end of the day it's your own head that's on the chopping block. A long throw on, found by Nicholl. Nicholl again, challenging. - First goal to Wales! I think the man was under pressure almost in every game he played because football, to him, was life. When I saw the game yesterday I honestly got the impression actually that we'd asked him to play one game too many. I knew... I could see there was something wrong. There was a lot of wires television wires all over the place and this camera guy kept winging down in front of us, and it became an annoyance. And the dream start that Wales wanted has been delivered. His last act as a Scotland manager was to throw David Cooper into the fray. A stray shot there, oh! That was a penalty kick! This could be the penalty kick with ten minutes to go to send Scotland... to the playoffs. - They've made it! The referee boys whistle but... and Jock, I think, thought it was time up. You know, and he got up... and he just sort of collapsed, and we grabbed him, you know. There goes the final whistle. Scotland have got the result they wanted so badly. Well, what night for Scotland! He always kept saying Mate, at end of the game, you know... you must keep your dignity... and acknowledge the fans" so, at end of game, I kept the players on the pitch. They told me he was alright so, we came back and congratulated players and Graham Souness was standing along the outside the medical room, crying... and I says, "What?", he says, "I think the big man's gone". I said, "Oh my God". I mean, it's a tragedy in our hour of triumph. You know, Jock has given us a lifeline to get to another World Cup. It's difficult to express the words, Martin because you know, he's been such a giant of football in Scotland and for him to go tonight We'll all feel a terrible loss. I'm quite sure that every fan standing here tonight would've wished Scotland to get pulled out of the World Cup for Mr Stein to still with us. He didn't take the credit on himself. Always giving it to the players and to the fans. He's a legend, he's one time. He'll remain a legend in Scottish football as far as I'm concerned. You play a football match without fans you've got nothing. It can be the greatest game in the world. If there are no people there to watch, it becomes nothing. Give an average game with a big crowd excitement, atmosphere, this makes it a great game. If you go to Celtic Park now, you'll see a modern stadium one of the best, has 60,000 spectators in it every time Celtic play there. Glorious lights in Europe and all of that. The genesis of it is the day Jock Stein became Celtic manager. When I used to try and quiz him about how he achieved it at Celtic winning that European Cup he would put it on the players, you know. He would never take any of the credit himself. I couldn't get him to say... Well, I did this for a reason" and that was it. We retell how we played real that day how Murdoch was in control or Big Billy was dominant you know, it would be thrown back towards the players and he never say a bad word about Celtic. Celtic are a serious proposition wherever they're playing, whoever they're playing against. And you still feel his presence in the presence of his team and that is his legacy. Jock Stein is a man who's got the blood of Bruce in his veins you know. That's my opinion of him. One of the most remarkable men that's ever been in the game. Alex Ferguson, the greatest manager of the Premier League era without question would not have considered joining Manchester United if Matt Busby hadn't built the club that was there waiting for Alex in 1986. Here we go, gentlemen, here we go. Hold it. He embraced the legacy. He understood perhaps the only club who could really, one day, challenge Liverpool. Rebuilding on the Busby model. Youth development, make our own players polish our diamonds. Wingers... Entertainment... everything that Busby had laid down and that he, Alex Ferguson, believed in. And that's why throughout the Ferguson era the crowd would sing Matt Busby's name. It's almost as if they knew. To me, it always gives Old Trafford a soul when you hear them sing Matt Busby's name. Cos they're right. Matt Busby is the soul of Manchester United. I think the main thing is to be human treat people the way you'd like to be treated yourself. Be disciplined, but don't over-discipline people but try and gain respect both for the people that are your family but mainly for yourself. I feel the best thing is to be a sort of good neighbour a good pal, and create good feelings. Football is the thing that unites everybody. Everybody cares, everybody has a team pretty much. The beauty of football is that it's so available. It's such an open game in that way. And you still see that all over the world you know, that's still why it's loved. Although their heyday is a long time ago the day in which they performed their great deeds Busby and Stein and Shankly... they still feel as if they're within touching distance and they still play a role in... animating the game in Britain... the way we think about it the aspirations we have for it, and for the teams we support. Their heartbeats were so strong that we can still hear them. They are the makers of modern British football. ♪ Where have we been to ♪ ♪ And what did you see? ♪ ♪ Don't really know why ♪ ♪ But it doesn't bother me ♪ ♪ Time is on your side right now ♪ ♪ But time can change ♪ ♪ What is it that you are wanting? ♪ ♪ And what are you hiding? ♪ ♪ Do you know where it is you're going to ♪ ♪ And hoping to find there? ♪ ♪ Time is on your side right now ♪ ♪ But time will change ♪ ♪ As you are now ♪ ♪ I once was ♪ ♪ As I am now ♪ ♪ You will be ♪ ♪ 'Time is on your side right now ♪ ♪ But time can change ♪ ♪ Time is on your side right now ♪ ♪ But time will change ♪ ♪ To my storm-bred sons ♪ ♪ And my hurricane daughter ♪ ♪ Who were born from sand And to sand we will return ♪ ♪ And wind and white water ♪ ♪ Cos time is on your side right now ♪
