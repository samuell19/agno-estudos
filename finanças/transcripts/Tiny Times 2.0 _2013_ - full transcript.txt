We lose our youth to time We lose our love also to time Everything on earth lose to time No one can escape the cruel gaze and trial from time Adopted from the bestselling novel of Jing M. Guo Tiny Times 1.0 Folded Paper Time How is it Backup Focus on my leg, my leg Aiyah, I know After graduating, I will surely become International Super Model, sexy and fashion Nan Xiang, your turn I hope next time, during graduation I can organize a small scale Art Exhibition Just a small one, for friends I told you my choreography is the most fashion Didn't you see how much the audience loved me Lily What Oh, graduation I don't want to take over my dad's company right away I'm not too interested in sailing on smoothly I might study abroad in the third year As for which school I'll have to do some further comparisons and assessments As... As for me I hope that after graduation I can find a good job With more, more pay And a gentle, caring, and humorous superior What, what, are you boy-crazy Okay... I'm done, I'm done Gu Yuan As for me, I'm looking forward to Lily becoming a good wife and mother at that time And even... Excuse me Hahahaha a moral exemplar wife and mother 38 Honorary Woman's Award There goes the wife, there goes the mother Then she'll buy soymilk and crullers for me every morning And wash my clothes at night In your dreams Wash you too Jian Xi Dad, everybody has a dark past But if you keep provoking me with this video clip I will get the picture of you as a child in your loose pants Enlarge it and frame it in gold to display in the company elevator Why don't you like it your child-voice is so pleasant All sweet, but now... Okay I'm going to school Finals are coming up, probably not going to be around this weekend Don't miss me too much Money never slumbers, Shanghai never sleeps On an small, ordinary street With the help of beer's cool foam People killed time through the hot nights of the rainy season And there are others, who since birth have been living on pricey real estate Their lives are sweet and lavish, as rose nectar Their feet, distanced from worldly dust They're cherubs of fate, living in the clouds Then there are some people Who are submerged in rich, hot chocolate Can't distinguish whether the flavour is bitter, or mellow Those wealthy, at the tip of the pyramid Every day for them is like a carefully designed formula Every nutrient placed according to the best ratio Their bodies, in turn, maintain the best shape Brightly shining lives, eternal, sparkling They've occupied the most wonderful area of Shanghai Receiving the envy of many As well as a cold loneliness that only comes from being on top Some learn to taste despair and hope every day Just like a solution made of dissolving pills After the vibrant colored candy coating fades There's only a bitterness left, known to none Some people are like a bottle of water, clear, simple Do you want water Colorless, tasteless, tangible Thanks And amongst us stressed college students In the midst of this hot summer All we can have are cup after cup of bitter coffee, like oriental medicine this bitter, but sweet liquid Helped us through many nights of no sleep Since the last final before graduation Has begun Nan Xiang is busy with painting every day and dressed like a paint worker She brought a pile of clay and dirt back to the dorms for sculpting And worries every day that Lily… would push her off the balcony Ruby is even more bizarre Her seething expression makes me wonder Whether she'll commit suicide via seppuku at any moment However, even while everybody is being driven crazy One woman is calm and collected She finished courses for both her majors by the third year So, our frantic fright of graduation finals Can be compared simply to Spiderman attending Special Olympics No trouble at all That's right she's the old friend whom I fear and love Lily Lin Xiao, could you not refer to me as your old friend It sounds a bit misleading Are you planting crops in the farm Lily, could you turn the sound down a bit You could probably guess the US Dollar exchange rate, anyway Why do you have to study in the bedroom For someone like you, with such a lack of will power If there is a bed in a one-hundred-meter radius Would you do anything else but sleep Because every corner of the school is filled with crazy people. How about the cafe we usually go to I got it. I'll clear out Sit. I've ordered for all of you already Aye, the owner lady looks like she's aged a lot There're so little customers, must be difficult lately I grazed her hand earlier it felt like a loofah I felt your hand too, it was like a golden cudgel staff Recommendation Can substantially increase the price and protect this cafe's brand quality Lower-end consumers won't... So expensive Is this gold that's being drunk One cup of Americano Since the last quarrel The Gu couple has been at a cold war But I'm not worried at all that they'd fall apart Even during their honeymoon period in high school they sound like they're arguing Don't you think we're good together Why It's not because both our last names are Gu, is it Because Within the entire school The only ones who understand this book Are you and me This is a high level math test for first year college students If you can get sixty points on it, I'll consider your proposal Sixty How about ninety Overseas, They are Mr. & Mrs. Smith Here, they are the Phoenix Legend not even lightning can split them apart Gu Yuan I was supposed to interview Chief Editor Lai Guang Xin of《Monthly Times》 I've just gotten a call from the head they want you to interview instead Did you pull something I'm much more adequate than you I simply made an objective statement, it isn't really pulling anything Don't you forget I helped you with all the clippings of 《Monthly Times》 dating from '04 to '07 So My dog's nails are cut by my servant Lucy would I tell Bitch Loser Okay okay okay it's not like you don't understand Lily She has a stainless steel mouth and a heart made of cotton candy Why are you alone? Where's Jian Xi I called him yesterday He said he's busy with tests, and doesn't have time for me No time for you Then you should set time aside for him Girls who like Jian Xi always in line Watch out I've told you Don't call me anymore I can't talk right now How much do you want Text me your account number Someone will transfer to you after Xi Cheng, I'm warning you Don't call me anymore What are you doing here Waiting for you to get out of class I was shopping just now, saw something that would look good on you So I bought it Mm How did you know which brand I wear And my size Of course auntie told me I don't just know your size Why are you so obedient to her She hopes you would marry me, so you want to marry me Don't you have anyone you like I do But even if I like him, I don't have to marry him Your logic is too advanced My IQ is too low, can't understand You should go communicate with Einstein Weren't you going to see Zhou Chong Guang What's going on here, I don't understand Today is Dragon Boat Festival I thought if there's any present that would fit His high status and match his artist flair Then the present would be Zongzi I got it This zongzi uses the retarded brain powder to make a mediocre filling What are you doing here Delivering zongzi So you found a new job doing deliveries That's not it... I... Today's the last day of internship Collecting the draft I'm leaving You scared Gong Ming away Why is Gong Ming at your place Guess Why is he wearing a track suit Guess If you don't give me this column, I'm going to call the cops Aiyah, don't be so mean to a patient, let me play for a bit Patient did you call yourself a patient Gastric cancer I'll believe you once more. My brain is in my heart You really got me into trouble last time, did you know After I went back, Kitty laughed at me until her eyes got wrinkles And she told me about all those incidents The lies you used to feed her How you'd gotten diabetes or cholecystitis Kitty's in the wrong for betraying me, then To think, I even went shopping and eating with her We were trench comrades, can't believe she actually betrayed me... Hey... Are you going to give the draft or not Draft or not... Draft or not What's the hurry girl, first time around the block I can tell you have no experience Aye, haven't you tried to collect Jing M, Guo's draft Last time he told an editor that his draft's done But that he's boarding a plane Then he disappeared in the following week Always boarding the plane Compared to Jing M, Guo, am I not cuter You people should go dip in a pig pen If you use the time for finding excuses on writing No matter a special column You may get the Nobel Prize in literature for many times I'm really going to go Bye bye, little assistant I'm not finished Please remember write the draft Otherwise I will really pour chili oil in your game system I mean it My last task at the internship for 《M.E》 Ended on not too happy of a note Even though I live with them in the same city I still feel that there's a great distance Between me and Gong Ming, Chong Guang, Kitty They seem like they belong to another brilliant world I stumbled in to tour for a moment And now I'm back where I came from My cell phone no longer rings of calls From those who belong in that crazy world Now, I finally have enough time To be with Nan Xiang, Ruby, and Lily Of course, as well as Jian Xi Hello, Jian Xi I'm going to school to see you, okay Ah but the volleyball team has an exhibition match I have to play, I can't spend time with you Oh, okay then Then we'll try for next time Mm, bye bye Sorry... Come What, going to fight Lin Xiao, how come you're here I'm here for Jian Xi, I heard you have an exhibition match today I'm here to cheer for him Exhibition match The exhibition match ended last week Didn't you know Jian Xi stopped coming to practice after that He stays in the art room working on his graduation poster all day I bought coffee and milk tea, which one do you want Coffee please Hello Are you done with the match Yeah Today... Was tiring So I don't have a lot of energy Mm Why don't you go eat something Don't starve Okay What'd you do last night Went home to get something Ruby didn't come back yesterday either I thought the two of you went to get a room What's the matter The circles around your eyes are so dark Your eye bags are sagging onto your chest... I saw Jian Xi kiss another woman yesterday Jian Xi Are you sure Don't cry yet If Jian Xi... Who is it What are you doing here Yo, Lin Xiao is here too Where's my wife Nan Xiang, is she here too Don't you call Nan Xiang that Nan Xiang She has not an ounce of association with you anymore Haven't you hurt her enough You don't think she's suffered enough If you love her as much as you say you do Then get as far as you can from her Stop hanging around us, why don't you see it as doing some good Doing what good Lily, your words are still so despicable Where's Nan Xiang, let her out Nan Xiang Get as far from here as you can Lily, you want to start something What are you doing Get out Oh, you want to start acting all ladylike Ah That time when you slept with me behind Nan Xiang's back That pathetic image I should have recorded footage of it so you can have a look at it What did you say Get out, you Lily, why do you look so guilty Why don't you tell us about it Lily Is he telling the truth Can you not ask me about this Lin Xiao, did you know Until today Until today when it concerned me I finally understood the phrase Everyone... Everyone, including myself has a time when they are completely stupid Because of that Everyone deserves the right to be forgiven once That was, in my memory, one of the few times Lily has cried, in the last few years My image of her Is that she's bled more times than she's cried I realized that her weakness affects me… more than her meanness In that moment I understood No matter how ridiculous are the things that she's done In my heart, she'll always be Lily I'll always be on her side But I neglected to account for everyone else they wouldn't accept her unconditionally Every time I catch the scent I'd feel That my youth, the days I've spent at school had never passed on too far Lily is very right Everybody deserves the right to be forgiven once Come, look at the camera One more Done yet Just one more Let me see let me see Why does it have to rain on a nice graduation You know nothing, the sky's crying for me since I'm leaving Why did you take it off again I haven't worn chemical fiber since I was 9 I'm actually allergic to it You should take it off too, before you get hospitalized What are you all doing after graduation Report to me, your older sister, first If anyone's too pathetic I'm going home to fire Lucy, and someone can replace her How can you... Please don't thank me, I'm a down-to-earth person After I graduate, I can officially work at《M.E》 Yesterday Kitty called to ask… when I'm graduating. I heard her voice, seems she's so busy she's fallen on her back On her back Lin Xiao can you stop talking in such a erotic way That's your own problem I found an internship At a clothing workshop The boss had studied abroad at France My dad found a private badminton coach I heard that he's a successful middle-aged man I'm actually a bit worried with my looks Maybe on some dark and windy night, I might Be dragged into a narrow alley and get violated That's impossible With your stocky build You won't fit in any narrow alleys The high school dorm door isn't that narrow Weren't you only able to slide through after putting on olive oil Oh, right I'll probably intern at the family company, nothing surprising Lily, how about you For the time being, I don't have time to worry about work I am waiting with all my heart and mind for... My birthday party Sure, the annual air defense alarm Finally rings again in the Shanghai sky Because it's Ms. Lily's birthday once again Lin Xiao I've invited Wei Hai already Consider a surprise for Ruby Are you going to tell Ruby If I tell her then it's not called a surprise My peer, is this chicken Looks tasty Hello Xi Cheng, let me tell you Even if we've slept together before Don't count on threatening me with that all your life You can go ahead and tell all my friends But you will pay with ten times the amount of pain Right, you're right Barefooted is not afraid of shoes When I don't have shoes to wear You can just wait to die, you Almost done If it were you what would you do If Lin Xiao's the one who slept with someone else I'm Lily What I mean is Between Lin Xiao and me I'm the one who cheated But let me ask you Lily and Xi Cheng Has slept with each other Do you still love her Lin Xiao, When you buy a present for Lily Buy her a present for me, too I really don't know what she likes Last year, I gave her a domestic blood pressure measuring device She ignored me for two weeks after No, ask Nan Xiang to buy it for you I'd rather dig for landmines in Vietnam Okay, I'll prepare a greeting card, how's that The greeting card you prepared for me for Jian Xi's birthday Almost made us break up What did she write You asked me how deeply I loved you An iron pestle can be ground down to a needle. Everybody's goose liver is three ounces I wanted to ask What are you feeding with ten ounces I'm coming over right now Ask the restaurant manager to wait for me there The three of you are all on my birthday banquet guest list Watch what you wear, don't pick long gowns Why, aren't those gowns more grandiose For people like you who don't wear gowns and heels It would surely be a disaster One second, you are attractively seducing a man The next second, you're stepping on your own skirt tail And falling straight into my birthday cake That bad, huh Of course, my birthday cake is 1.84 meters Last time, for my aunt's birthday due to the same reason my aunt refused to contact me ever again Even if you fell into the cake and ruined your aunt's birthday She still shouldn't cut family ties with you She's in the wrong there Too ridiculous You've mistaken, Lin Xiao The one who fell into the cake in her gown is my aunt, not me I think we shouldn't have the frame and the white candles This isn't a funeral, what do you think If you insist on red napkins and golden utensils Then you might as well stick a married sign on my window And prepare a love nest for me after the meal Freeze I've emphasized birthday banquet flowers What are these carnations all about Which girl do you know likes carnations You might as well fill the house up… with cacti instead Dad, if you don't make it back by my birthday I am going to switch all your cigars with rolled fruit snacks Joking, do I look like I'm joking There's no use hiding your cigars All of your safes' passwords are 123456, don't think I don't know Hello Miss Gu Hello Happy birthday, you're so gorgeous Happy Birthday Gu Li, Happy Birthday, you get prettier every time Thanks Thanks Ladies You're revealing way too much Why isn't Nan Xiang here yet I've sent her a text message, she should be here soon Then we won't wait Bring the food Yes Hey To a trained eye, we're eating To an untrained eye, we're in a surgery room There's nobody else here, if you want to drink soup with your knife I won't say anything either Waiter would you bring me a pair of chopsticks Wei Hai your seat is next to Ruby Ruby, I ordered raw oysters today, your favorite Why aren't you eating Oh Can't open Wei Hai open one for Ruby Sure You're blushing even before drinking You two really fit well together Lily actually... actually you misunderstood I already have a girlfriend Ruby, can you have more dignity If you keep seducing Wei Hai, it won't be only soup that'll be flung on your face next time Ruby is a good girl we can still be good friends I'm not mistaken So what if you have a girlfriend these days As long as there's no registered marriage, legally Everyone is still single I understand the matters of the heart You can't clap with one hand Today there are many hands present Everyone can clap a little it's quite simple Lily, shut up What I'm doing this to help you, am I wrong You're not wrong You're never wrong Oh, no Actually, you think you're never wrong You always decide on your own to help us But you do things behind our backs every time Gu Yuan did you know Wei Hai had a girlfriend Yes Then why didn't you tell me earlier Now I'm in a difficult position, are you happy now Are you even rational you secretly invited Wei Hai Did you tell me you were going to do this Lily, don't get mad This has nothing to do with Gu Yuan What does it have to do with you, Jian Xi Why don't you handle your own issues first You haven't cleaned your own ass and are so eager to hold someone else's pants What do you mean my own ass Did you tell Lily about my situation Your situation what situation About last time when you let someone… feed you coffee like you're handicapped Lin Xiao, don't add fuel to this flame If your fire hadn't burned My fuel would have no place to go Gu Yuan, you know quite a lot No wonder last time you sarcastic said that I should spend more time with Jian Xi You two are really partners in crime You're more connected than the Calabash Brothers how disgusting Lin Xiao not so fast You don't think you and Lily conspire You think your "little secrets" with your sisters are not disgusting You told Jian Xi Lily, what's wrong with you, you suspected me I haven't said anything I said it What are we arguing for, over this trivial stuff We are all gathered here today so that we can celebrate the birthday of our friend Lily, whom we've known since we were children I've been unfortunate since little Whether in family or romance, nothing has worked out I've experienced a lot of disgusting and tragic things And the one to hurt me the most Xi Cheng Everybody knows Luckily, I met Lily Thanks to her caring for me all these years No matter how cold people think Lily is how unsociable, how selfish But I know she's not like that Or I should say she's not entirely like that That's why she wanted to save me no matter what Or to share my burden Even to bring it upon herself Simply put she did what I've done And slept with Xi Cheng The ironic thing is she thinks I don't know But Lily We are such close sisters How could I not know So today, I want to toast my sister To thank her for sharing my miserable life I also wish from the bottom of my heart From now on, her life would… burn and stink like mine does So everybody already knew Do you still love her Can you break off an arm Can you saw off a leg For this many years Lily has become a part of me There's no way I wouldn't love her What's the matter Lily's dad... Kitty, contact the media and public relations Organize a press conference I'm going to announce the news of Zhou Chong Guang's gastric cancer Mr. Gong... Lin Xiao, let's go Why are you still here Just in time, go see Zhou Chong Guang for me I'm going to the office to do something, come with me I... Don't just stand there, come Why are you at the hospital Aren't you at the hospital too and dressed like this did you get married Lily's dad got into an accident Is it serious Don't get up What's going on here Gastric cancer I remember telling you Don't cry I hate when girls cry Come, I'll play a song for you Lin Xiao At my funeral Tell Gong Ming He must use this song as background music Gong Ming You don't know yet he's my brother No wonder he was here in the past Both of us liked listening to this song when we're little So, I want to hear it for the last time At my funeral Don't say that you will get better They always say that in TV shows Don't cry Okay, okay Don't cry, don't cry You are living at the rainy concern Feeling sympathy to the world A voice rings out in your heart and cease Just like a cold wind blowing into heart Beating with the heart beat together Nan Xiang still didn't come If you didn't make him rush to your birthday party He wouldn't have sped so recklessly on the highway Now he's lying here You're happy You're pleased You're already looking through the will I really wasted time raising you Yes, mother It's not easy to raise me Mother Who's your mother That slut who gave birth to you that's your mother No need to remind me it's mentioned in the will I regret raising you till now You'll get what's coming Your dad is still lying there, his body isn't cold yet You just see how much money you can get Your heart's been devoured by a dog My dad's will be cremated There'll only be ashes, no bones What happened Nothing, let's go Finally, graduation still came The sadness of possibly not seeing one another ever again Spreads throughout campus like a pandemic flu But recovery from a flu is always quick and certain This dorm will be filled with younger people They'll be here to continue The youth we've left behind Nobody can be forever young But there will always be people who are young What about Nan Xiang's stuff Just keep it for now I called her for a few days already, she hasn't picked up Let's go How much stuff did you put in your bag after all I just took a bottle of champagne You should save your surprise for when I pull a refrigerator out Okay Be careful To us To our future To the men in our future Cheers To find a satisfied apartment in the center of Shanghai City Is as difficult as finding a good man to marry Is it okay for a new graduate to live in a place like this Lightning will strike I'll just sell admission fee here, no need for a job To find a satisfactory apartment in… Jing'an District in the center of Shanghai City Is as difficult as finding a good man to marry, and who would not cheat after marrying This is all porcelain, be careful Put it in the living room for me, don't open it Still, Lily rented an villa in the Jing'an District Lily, this is too much I only need one piece of luggage Honey, I want to put everything in one luggage too But I'm not as strong as you, I can't carry it Lin

all my fault Nan Xiang, don't forget Didn't you say Lily has money And told me to ask her for some It's too late to throw it out Shut up What's the matter Did I hit you where it hurts Xi Cheng When I told you to go to Lily I was angry How was I supposed to know you'd be so cheap You made me suffer I deserved it I have nothing to say But let me warn you If you go to Lily and any of the three of them I'll never let you off even if I die Ms. Gu, the shareholders are here Get me more coffee Aye, you I'm not used to instant coffee Go buy me one from elsewhere Okay, right away But before I come

Okay, stop the pointless talk, drink some water Many times You don't drink I still think, he would disappear anytime I tried to put this thought away Because I would become very depressed Is it Chong Guang, yes that's him Hurry up, go I'm sorry, no pictures, no pictures Could I get an autograph I'm sorry, no more pictures Can I give you his book This floor is scary, let's just go Just don't look at it Come, come here Lin Xiao They say that when people die, the soul will float upward Into the sky, and watch the entire land See, aren't we like this right now Stop kidding, you're talking rubbish Hello, Gu Yuan, what's the matter Jian Xi's leaving Shanghai Departing at 4pm From HongQiao Airport Terminal 2 Jian Xi That's it The ultimate ending to my lengthy romance My mom's offering 500 million If I were you, I'd sell You're so eager to help your mom against me After completing this purchase, you probably get a hefty sum She did make me... and offer I couldn't refuse You're supposed to be the one I trust the most Why is it that when I needed you most You've chosen to stand against me I can't make any sense of this Gu Yuan is helping Ye Chuan Ping purchase Sheng Gu Ye Chuan Ping is his mother of course he has to obey... his mother's But Lily is his girlfriend What's with you, so sullen Yesterday when I went out with Chong Guang He told me he's undergoing surgery He said it'll be okay It's just removal of stomach Absolutely I said no But besides saying no I don't know what else to do for him Hello Don't blame Gong Ming for getting mad With his position Even if he hits you he can get away with it I know... He is Chong Guang's brother That's not entirely it I found out when I was investigating 《M.E》 That Zhou Chong Guang is not Gong Ming's blood brother He was brought over by Gong Ming's stepmother Zhou Chong Guang was never likeable And he didn't try in academics, the Gong family had given up on him In an elite family like that Zhou Chong Guang only listened to one person And that's Gong Ming All of Zhou Chong Guang's achievements and fame Were built up by Gong Ming's own hands All of the contracts in his life, including real estate were signed by Gong Ming But you You came out of nowhere And let Zhou Chong Guang do such a dangerous surgery behind Gong Ming's back I didn't know any of this... Kitty Regarding Zhou Chong Guang's death timer plan it will pause for now So now... Now there's nothing you can say If he believes you this much Then you'd better believe he'll awaken safely A long long time ago There's a kingdom covered in thistles and thorns In that barren kingdom There's been a legend In the middle of the withering, dark forest There's a sleeping prince within the ancient palace The prince is asleep because he's waiting for the fated princess to wake him And only a princess with utmost faith can wake him And bring him from a murky edge back to reality Autumn wind and winter snow The stairs in rhe memory Stay in line with silence If the world becomes in pure white Then please let me fall in love with snow In my past and now I will be with every dust You're awake I'm not dreaming, am I Ouch Your story is so bad if my novel is like that The sales drop could be very dangerous Thank you Lily I'm back for some documents Oh They're all in your father's study I haven't touched it Do you mind my eating with you Dad I think you'd believe in me Now I'm going to take this risk Our company is going to fall I think Constanly will buy us off I saw the president to their subsidiary company Wow, he's more handsome than he is in pictures Really, how come I heard that the Ye Group is making the purchase But in any case Their president's son is a real character According to the numbers provided by the accountant Sheng Gu Group's net worth is an estimated 530 million Oh, I know Within Sheng Gu's estimated 530 million There is about 100 million in intellectual property And 50 million in goodwill that's accumulated recently There's no real value According to a reliable source, though Sheng Gu's woods by the Southwest Will be purchased at premium price after two years And developed into a wildlife sanctuary and tourism resource center If purchased now, a conservative prediction in price increase would be 300 million Ask her for 600 million Tell Gong Ming, Ye Group has given a price of 614 million 614 million... I'll probably get caught What if Gong Ming asked me How did I come up with that number, what do I tell him Tell him you slept with my boyfriend to get this That won't work Why won't it, anyway you are the one who takes advantage Constanly Group's offering 700 million My ideal is 800 million If it's not over 800 million, don't call me Thank you all for being here After careful assessment and comparisons Sheng Gu Group shareholders agree, for a price of 800 million to complete a purchase with our future strategic partners I believe that Constanly Group Will bring Sheng Gu toward better resources and direction Also, starting today I will assume position of Finance Director for 《M.E》 You bought it at this price it's a loss in business Can't you see that I've won the biggest fruit of victory in this battle You know as well as I do Constanly's price was not low After Sheng Gu's purchased they will have a wider stage of opportunity As for me My personal thought is Why don't you consider coming to《M.E》 See A cup of water like this Do you know how to maintain its volume If you pour the water into the sea It's a waste You were so close to being together But it doesn't matter We can finally prepare for your engagement ceremony with Yuan Yi Are you two satisfied with today's situation Pretty good Clothes have been burst open Mr. Gong, why're you here too Aren't you here too We were invited by Gu Yuan Mr. Gong was invited by Gu Yuan's great grandfather They're old friends This way please, Mr. Gong Do you smell that What Gong Ming's smell How about it Charming Attractive Feeling high Come on Those liquid sprayed on his body is also highly expensive The liquid sprayed on this body Lin Xiao, can you stop talking in such a erotic way What are you talking about See that Yuan Yi, she's a sore sight I have to get drunk first To stop myself from making a scene Then you have to stop me from making a scene first Aye, Gu Yuan, congratulations Aye Who is that next to you, dressed like a bride Where's Lily, why didn't she come I'm the bride Then I should toast you Aiyah Lin Xiao, what are you doing Toasting, we've known Lily for so many years Lily's friend, is my friend But anyway Lily's enemy, is our enemy You brought someone to steal my dance partner, who should I dance with then Dance with me, of course But you're wearing such a flashy skirt, could you dance in that You're late for a full 10 minutes, that's not like you Wanted you to enjoy being a groom longer, isn't that good I enjoy the feeling of being on top more Haven't seen you for a few days, have you gained weight You just can't handle me What's she doing Do you think she hid dynamite under that skirt See how much space that skirt has Even a refrigerator is possible If she can open the skirt on the stage And give birth to Gu Yuan's baby there Then that is really over Really over to the top Even Gwan Yin Buddah can do nothing about it Ten Five Open, nope I'm very happy everybody is gathered here today To celebrate my best...
