- Hey, Shane. - Are you home? I did it. I got in. Hey, baby. How was the interview? Another waste of time. Decided to give the job to somebody with more experience. What's the point of us even going to college if all we have to show for it are student loans that we're never gonna pay off? - You know what? - Just forget them. We'll figure something out, right? We always do. I'm open to ideas. Um... What's this? Didn't we agree we couldn't afford this, that we have to save every penny while we stay at home with the baby? But it's an investment in our future, you know? Maybe we can find a day care and... - Day care? - With... with what money, Ava? Do you know how much tuition costs for graduate school? How are we gonna eat? How are we gonna pay the rent? We don't have the money for this, Ava. I don't have the money... to give you what you want. - Honey, no. - It's gonna be okay. - You'll see, we just... - Get off me. Was this your plan? Hmm? Your way of figuring something out? Hmm? You're gonna go back to school, and then what, huh? You'll make more money than me and then leave me, right? No, Shane, baby, look, please don't do this again. You're not going anywhere. You hear me? You're never gonna leave me. You'll never leave me. Ava, you did it. I wasn't sure you'd ever really go through with it. Neither was I. Kyle, what if I'm making a mistake? You're doing the right thing, for you and the baby. Thank you. Seriously, I can't thank you enough. - It's freezing. - Here, put this on. Just stick to the plan, and you'll be fine. You need to go. I filled up the tank, and you can keep her for as long as you need her. Wish I could come with you. I know. But you need to focus on finals. And you need to focus on yourself and the baby. Call me when you get there. - Hey, it's Lilla. - Leave me a message. Hey, Lilla. It's... it's your sister. Look... I know we haven't talked in a while. And I wanted to tell you some good news. I got into grad school today. Also, I'm pregnant. I know. I'm sorry you had to find out this way. Um, anyway, I was wondering if I can stay with you for a little bit. I'm seven miles outside of Gillespie right now. I can be there in a day or two, if you want. Um, yeah, I-I-I love you, and... Oh, jeez. Honey, she's awake. Oh... Oh, I wish you didn't take that out. You could have hurt yourself. - Who are you? - What am I doing here? - You're okay. - You were in an accident. Here, sit back. - What? Acc... - Look at me. I'm a doctor. You're okay. Doctor? - My baby. - Your baby is safe. You're both safe. - Poor thing. - You must be scared to death. - Who are you? - I'm Valerie. And this is my husband, William. - What's your name? - Ava. You're very lucky we found you when we did, Ava. We were trying to get home in the storm, and we barely saw your car wrecked on the side of the road. Yeah, I-I remember now. The rain was just so heavy, I lost control and swerved right off the road. Well, luckily, it happened so close to our home. Who knows when anyone else might have found you all the way out here? And you walked away with a few bumps and scrapes but nothing major. Are you sure that my baby is... - Positive. - Your baby's just fine. But what do you say we take a closer look when you're feeling up to it? Thanks. But I feel more comfortable getting checked at a hospital. I'm afraid that's not possible, at least for now. The roads are still flooded from the storm. But I'm sure there's emergency services. If we call, couldn't they send someone. I'm afraid not. It looks like the wind was so strong, it took out the phone towers. I mean, we haven't had a signal all day. My phone... Where are my clothes? You were soaking wet after the crash, so I washed your clothes. I-I put those dry ones on you. I hope you're comfortable. I had to improvise. That's William's shirt, and those are my exercise pants. And I'm so sorry about your phone. We were in such a rush to get you here before the roads gave out, I didn't even think to go back to your car for your things. As soon as the phone lines come back on, we will get you straight to the hospital, okay? In the meantime, you're our guest. And you're in great hands with William. - Thanks. - I mean, thank you both. I don't know how to thank you enough. - It's fine. - Okay, so you need your rest. I'm gonna be right down those stairs, okay? You need anything at all, just shout. We'll come check on you soon. Ava. Ava. Ava? Baby, where are you? She wouldn't. Ava. Ava! Aah! You can come in, you know? Take a seat. Shouldn't be on your feet anyway. So... so how are you feeling? Good. Better, you know, considering... When are you due? Feels like it could be any day now. Well, definitely looks like it. So tell me, Ava, what is a young woman who is almost due driving around alone in the middle of nowhere? How long has he been beating you? It's not really like that. A few months. But it wasn't always like this. When we first met, he was... so kind and so caring. - What changed? - After graduation, he just couldn't find a decent job. That's when it first started. It was little things at first. But then week by week, it kept getting worse until... You realized you and your baby deserved better. I had a choice to make. I couldn't protect Shane from himself. But I could protect our baby. So what are you working on? Oh, these are just some initial designs for an office in Austin. - Oh, you're an architect? - I am. Wow. These are so beautiful. I always thought that these things, you know, designing buildings and stuff, was so cool. I used to read up on women like Zaha Hadid and Kazuyo Sejima, and, I mean, I just loved the stuff they came up with. - Did you study that in school? - No. I was a theater kid in college. And for as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a director. I even got accepted into the graduate theater program. I mean, Shane didn't take the news so well. That's when I decided to leave him. Look at me now. Ava, I know you may not be able to see this now, but you are on the road to someplace better. I mean, you've already taken the first step, and that is always the hardest. Thank you for saying that. You're a brave young lady. And you deserve a great life partner. That's nice to hear. I was so lucky when I found William. I mean, don't get me wrong. We've had our problems. But we've always stood by each other, no matter what. So, until you find your William, you have to take care of yourself, for you and for your... Do you have any children? No. Whoa, chill out. - Who is it? - You know who it is, Kyle. Let me in. - She's not here, Shane. - Go away. Tell me where she went, damn it. If you don't stop, I'm gonna call campus security. - Please, I'm... I'm sorry. - I-I just need to know that she's okay and that our baby's safe. - She's fine. - Where'd she go? She borrowed my car and made me promise not to tell you. - I know I screwed up. - Can we just talk? - What the hell, man? - Where is she? Someplace safe from you. Look, I know you're Ava's GBF or whatever you guys are calling it, but I am sick of you meddling in our lives. Tell me where she is. Go... Tell me. I always told her she was too good for you. Asshole. What the hell is wrong with you? She's gone. I gave her my car so she could get as far away from your crazy ass as she could. - Where? - I don't know. Stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop. Her sister's, okay? Shane, you've hurt her enough. She'll never let you see the baby like this. I'm just glad she finally listened to me. You told her to leave me? Get off me. Get off me. Hey. Hey. - Does this hurt? - No. - Okay. - Sit up for me. And finally... - Here? - No. That feels pretty relaxing, actually. Good. Well... it appears you walked away from this crash completely unscathed. That's a relief. So, for the next couple of days, I need you to be mindful of your body, okay? The symptoms for whiplash, you know, it takes a little time to set in. So let me know if you feel any tension in your neck or your lower back. Sure. And, uh, my baby? Well, let's have a listen, shall we? Sit up for me. There you go. I'm just gonna put my hand here. It might be a little cold. Okay. So what I hear is the... heartbeat of a perfectly healthy little boy or girl. - Thank you. - I was so worried. You want to listen? - Can I? - Yeah. Okay. You hear it? Wow. Yeah. Yeah, I can hear it. Oh... I'm gonna go ahead and take these from you. Oh. Yeah, right. It's a girl, by the way. - I'm sorry? - My baby. It's a girl. I know some people like it to be a surprise, but I couldn't wait till she was born to find out. Wow. I, uh... I don't think I could resist either. I'd be too excited. Well, I'm excited now, but at first, I wasn't. Why not? I mean... I was furious with myself. How could I let this happen? I'm barely out of college. I had all these plans for my life. And, boom, like, suddenly, all those possibilities just blink out of existence. Hmm. But there's something else there, too, now. There's my daughter. I love her. And I-I know I haven't even met her, but I-I know I love her. I'm sorry. I overshare. I get really sentimental lately. No, it's perfectly fine. Anyway, uh, you and Valerie seem pretty well put together. What are you doing living out in the woods? Well, we both appreciate the peace and quiet. You know what I mean? No road noise, no obnoxious neighbors you have to deal with. Lots and lots of space to do whatever we like. It's nice. Sounds like it. But doesn't it get lonely? I mean, I'd go crazy not having anybody else to talk to. When you're with the right one, you don't need anybody else. That's so romantic. And what about your work? Is it hard to see your patients out here? Uh, I don't have patients anymore. I have clients now. Mainly do academic research, publish and review papers, that sort of thing. - Sounds impressive. - I assure you, it is not. Oh, but what a day we end up having, huh? Yeah. Hopefully the phones start working again. My sister must be worried sick. I'm sure she is. But as soon as the utilities are up, you can give her a call. Your land is beautiful. Do you mind if I went for a walk and just took a look around? I mean, I would prefer you rest a little bit, but if you want to take a walk, feel free. Don't venture too far out into the woods, though. It's more or less safe out there, but every now and then, you get a wild animal, poison ivy, all that jazz. Sure. I'll keep an eye out. Thanks, Dr. McGlynn. Please... call me William. Thanks, William. The storm knocked out all the phones and Internet yesterday. The phones. Here you are. Did you enjoy your walk? Yeah, it was really relaxing. - We just made some dinner. - Would you like to join us? So where are you from, originally, Ava? Oh, Illinois, just outside Chicago. Family still live up that way? - Yeah. - My parents and my sister. Parents know about... - Um... - Stop it, William. You're making her uncomfortable. It's just a question. No, it's... it's okay. Um, my parents and I, we haven't talked in a while. I was a rebellious kid. In college, I made some choices that they disagreed with. I treated them badly, so they cut me off. Said they'd welcome me back in when I was serious about making a change. - That's terrible. - I'm sorry. Well, they were right. I was actually on my way to try and reconnect with them. I'm so excited that the phones are working again. I mean, maybe I can make it by my sister's place tomorrow. - Oh, Ava, I'm so sorry. - The phones are still off. What do you mean? I heard William talking on his cell earlier. - That's not possible. - We haven't had signal all day. Am I crazy? I know I heard your voice. You were outside talking to someone about your work being delayed. Oh, that. No. That was just my recorder. I like to take work notes by dictation, especially when the Internet's out. That's all that was. Ava, as soon as the phone lines are back on, your sister is gonna be thrilled to hear from you. Oh, and we're gonna help you get your car fixed. You can get in contact with your family. I know it's really important to you. Great. You two seem pretty cut off yourselves. No family in the area? Well, we lost both of our parents, and we don't have any brothers and sisters, so it's just us. And that's all we need. But being all alone like this, I mean, it must be tough sometimes. Ever have one of your clients get upset that they can't reach you? No, not really. Especially with the phones out? I mean, it must be pretty frustrating not being able to contact you, even on your cell. I mean, we're professionals, Ava. People understand that. And, more importantly, they trust us. Well, I think that's great. It takes a lot to earn that kind of trust. So, Ava, tell me, have you thought of any baby names? No, not yet. Well, I mean, I've considered a bunch of them, but I don't know... I kind of think it'd be weird to name her without actually meeting her. I want a name that fits, you know? I'm sorry. I've... I've never heard of that. It's smart. It's very smart. It's very smart. Oh, I should have done this when we sat down. Let's make a toast. To Ava and her new baby and to fate for bringing her to us. Hear, hear. If we call, couldn't they send someone? It looks like the wind was so strong, it took out the phone towers. We haven't had a signal all day. I heard William talking on his cell earlier. I like to take work notes by dictation. That's all that was. Who could have done this to the phone wires? Okay. Phone, phone, phone, phone, phone, phone. Yes! Come on. Charger. Okay. Charger, charger, charger. Oh, William. Charger. William. Anyway, I was wondering if I can stay with you for a little bit. I'm seven miles outside of Gillespie right now. I can be there in a day or two, if you want. Um, yeah, I-I-I love you. Hey, it's Ava. Leave me a message. Ava, hey, it's Lilla. Sorry I missed your call. It's been... It was just a surprise to hear from you out of nowhere like that. But it was a good surprise. Of course you can stay here for as long as you need. I haven't been able to reach you. So, if you get this, give me a call. I hope everything's okay. She should have been here by now. Hey, Connie. Would you mind watching my dog the next couple of days? Yeah, everything's fine. I just need to get out of town last minute. Okay, awesome. Thanks so much. You two seem pretty cut off yourselves. No family in the area? - It's just us. - And that's all we need. Who knows when anyone else might have found you all the way out here? The roads are still flooded from the storm. What are you doing all the way out here? I just wanted to stretch my legs a little. - Change of scenery, huh? - After being cooped up inside? - Yeah. - The fresh air feels good. - Yeah. Well, hop in. - I'll give you a ride back. You know, I actually wanted to walk a little further. Oh. Well, there's no point I going that way. That's where all the flooding is. That's what I was just checking on. Really? I'm surprised it's still that bad. I mean, the road over here looks perfectly fine. Do you think I'm lying to you, Ava? No. No, of course not. You shouldn't be out here all alone. If something happens to you, there's no one around. Come on, let me give you a ride back. Sure. Thanks. I think I'm gonna have some lunch. - Can I make you something? - No, thanks. I think you were right about being on my feet, actually. I'm exhausted. I'm gonna lay down for a bit. Okay. Let me know if you change your mind. Ooh. Not now, baby. Mommy's trying to think. Car keys, car keys. Oh, yes. Ava, what... I was just... - We can't. I... - I'm... I'm sorry. In your office yesterday, I thought I felt a connection. - Okay. It's not... - William... Well, um... Ava was just looking for you. Really? Yes. I'm sorry. I-I thought I heard you in here. I was wondering if you had a fresh set of towels. I was just about to shower, myself. - Towels. - I can get you some of those. William, I need to speak to you alone. - Uh, Right. - Yes. Thanks. I can do this. I have to do this. Ow, not now, baby. Hang in there just a little longer. It's locked. Damn, the door. Aah! Ava, what are you doing? Aah! You're going into labor. - No, no, no. - Come inside. Come inside. - Not now! Not now! No, no, no. - Come on. No. No. No, please take me to a hospital. I want to go to a hospital, please! - You know that's not possible. - William will take care of you. William, it's time! It's gonna be okay. No, no, no. It's gonna be... William! I'm here. I'm here. - Help her into bed. - No, no, no. - Come on. Hang on, hang on. - No, no, no. - It's gonna be okay. - Lie down, put your feet up. That's right. Lie down. Lie back. No, no. No, I want to go to a hospital, please, please. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - Aah! Just relax. Relax. Please take me to a hospital, please. What the hell is that? What the hell is that? No. - Just something for the pain. - No, no. Please, no. Stop. Just something to help you relax. - Stop. No, stop. - That's right. You're okay. You're okay. - Stop. - It's okay. It's just something for the pain. Just breathe. That's it. She's out. You're awake. - My baby. - Where is she? I'm afraid I have some very bad news I have to tell you, Ava. The extent of the damage from the accident must have been worse than I could tell. No. Don't say it. It's not true. I'm so sorry, Ava. - No. - I'm so sorry. - No. - She didn't survive the birth. - No! It's not true! - You're lying! You're lying! Where is she? - I'm so sorry, Ava. - No. William, where is she? I want my daughter. Ava, you need to stay in the bed. No, no. - Ava, you need to... - Ava, please come back. - No! - Where are you hiding her? Get off of me! Where is she? - Ava, come back here. - No. - You really need to be in bed. - Where is she? - Ava, come on. - No. William, please tell me where she is. Let's go to bed. Let's take... let's just go to... - Ava, Ava, Ava, Ava! - No, no, no! - Listen to me! Listen to me! - Where is she? Where is she? - Where is she? - Okay. Okay. It's okay. - Where is she? - Okay, okay, okay. I'm so sorry. You're gonna be okay, I promise. Okay, let's get you back to bed. I'm gonna give you some medicine. It's gonna make you better, okay? Hey. Ava, Ava, Ava! Ava! Ava. Ava, open the door. Ava, Ava, you're gonna... You're gonna hurt yourself. - Let me get you some medicine. - I don't want your medicine! And I don't want you to take care of me! I want my daughter! Where is she, William? What did you do with her? You don't need to hear me say that again. You... I can't imagine what you're going through right now. I know you're lying to me. I know you're lying to me about my daughter. - You're not well. - You're not well, Ava. If she's dead, then how did she die, huh? Where's her body? - Okay, you are right. - The roads are clear now. I spoke to my friend in town. He's the coroner, Dr. Kaufman. He came in earlier this morning, and he took away the... He retrieved... To take her away... You don't want to see that, Ava. I am trying to tell you. - How could this happen? - Why did it happen? - Ava, you need... - You need bedrest today. Tomorrow I will take you into town. We will get you proper treatment. But for right now, just open the door. - No, leave me alone, William. - Leave me alone. Okay. Valerie is gonna be home in a bit, and, uh... I'll have her check on you, okay? No. I'm gonna be right here in the other room. You just... No, no sign of her yet. I'm starting to get worried. Maybe all of this is for nothing. Who knows? She's always been kind of flaky. Seven miles to Gillespie. Sorry, Connie, listen, I need to call you back. Thanks again for everything. I'll call you tomorrow. Hello, is anyone there? - Hi. - Oh, sorry. I didn't... I didn't mean to scare you. Who the hell are you? I'm looking for my girlfriend. She disappeared a couple days ago. - Wait, you're looking for Ava? - Yeah. How'd you know? I'm Lilla, Ava's sister. Wow, I... She's told me all about you. I thought you guys weren't close. We haven't been for a while. She gave me a call the other day, though, and it sounded like she was in trouble. Do you know anything about that? She, um... isn't well. Hasn't been for a long time. Whatever she told you probably didn't sync up very close to reality. You know how she can be. Yeah, maybe. I don't know if it was the pregnancy hormones or what, but she disappeared on me while I was at work. Tried to track her down before she hurt herself, but looks like I was too late. She was definitely here. Where is she now? I think somebody took her. How could you know that? Look, there, in the mud, there's tire tracks coming in and then... going out. Damn. You're right. Question is, did they stop to help or... Oh. She's... I can't believe that. I won't believe it. She's my world. The thought of losing her and our baby... It's okay. I'm sure she's fine. We just have to find her. I saw a little town hall a ways up the road. Maybe someone there saw something. - It's worth a shot. - Anything is. Do you want to ride with me? Yeah. That'd be great. Thanks. You ready to go? Ava, I know what you're going through is incredibly difficult. I don't want to talk right now. I just want you to know you're not alone. Val and I... we understand. Long time ago, we used to dream of having a child of our own. After trying for a long time, it actually happened. She was pregnant. You should have seen the design she came up with for the nursery. But it wasn't meant to be, and, um, she miscarried. The doctor said it'd be likely impossible for her to carry a baby to full term. We were devastated. How'd you fill it, you know, that extra space you made for the baby? - We didn't. - It's still there. No matter how much success we have in our careers or how much love we pour into each other and our relationship... There's nothing that can fill it. Ava, when we met, you were on your way to starting a new life. Now, that version of it might not be possible now, but there is nothing stopping you from reclaiming the life that you had... along with all the hopes and dreams that you thought you lost. Part of me wishes I could do the same, but... I guess we're past that. But you... you can be happy again. Come on. We'll get your car towed into town. I'll take care of the repairs. Let's get you set on the road to that new life of yours. What was that? What was what? - That, that noise. - Ava. Ava. - I knew you had my baby. - Where is she? Ava. Come on, Ava. - No. - Ava, come back. Come here. This is not what it looks like, Ava. Don't talk. I trusted you. Give her to me, now! Give me my baby. Give me my baby! Sorry about those. It's unfortunate, I know, but it's necessary. You thirsty? What the hell is wrong with you? You should've gotten in that car, Ava. Why are you doing this? You know, when William and I found you unconscious and pregnant on the side of the road, it was literally like fate had delivered us a gift. I mean, at first, we really did want to help you. But when we realized your situation, it made perfect sense... Nurse you back to health, make you believe you lost the baby, and then send you on to your new life, unburdened. - "Unburdened"? - Are you listening to yourself? What makes you think you would have made a good mother? You can't even take care of yourself, let alone your child. Go to hell. Ava, you need to be honest with yourself. Your child is better off without you. No! You're insane. You can't just take someone's child, and you can't leave me strapped up in your house like this! Someone will notice. Someone will come looking. Ava, no one knows where you are. They wouldn't even know where to begin to look for you. So what are you gonna do with me, then? Well, we're just trying to figure that out. I mean, we can't keep you tied up indefinitely. And we certainly can't let you go now that you know the truth. So, in the meantime... I'm going to need you to take one of these. Don't worry. They're safe. - Okay, then. - You want to play like that? Swallow. Swallow. Good girl. Now... we will be back in a little bit to check on you. Wait. If you can't let me go and you can't leave me here, then what other option is there? He looks official. Sir. Excuse me, sir. - What can I do for you, miss? - I'm just wondering if you might be able to help me with something. I'm looking for my sister... 5'3", black hair, 22 years old. She's very pregnant. - I'm sorry. - I haven't seen anyone - that looks like that. - Are you sure? She drove through here just a few days ago. Maybe she came in to ask for directions or even just use the restroom. - I'm sorry. - Did you talk to the sheriff? Maybe one of the deputies has seen her. You know, they've been out checking on people after the storm. - Sure, that's good idea. - You know what? Let me just drop this off, and I'll lead you over. We can't talk to the sheriff. - Why not? - We could use his help. I don't want Ava to get in trouble. What are you talking about? That car, I've never seen it before. And you just failed to mention this to me until now? Why would she steal a car? What? The sheriff's department's just a block over. Uh, on second thought, she probably just took a wrong turn or something. - Are you sure? - It's really no trouble. No, thank you, sir. We've taken up enough of your time. Let's get out of here. This place gives me the creeps. It's too small... Seems like one of those places where everyone's up in each other's business. Right, it does. Hey, sorry. Um, do you know if there are any houses off the road coming into town? Ava. Ava, you awake? William? What is it? I just, um... I just wanted to see how you were doing? Right. I've been better. Why are you doing this to me, William? All the things you said to me, all the things you've shared, I really felt like you cared about me. I do. I do care about you, okay? I'm doing everything I can to get you a happy ending here. - Then just let me go. - I can't do that. I wish I could, but you know I can't do that. - I promise. - I won't tell the police. Just let me and my baby go, and you'll never hear from us again. It's too risky. If it was just me, then maybe, but I can't do that to Valerie. Valerie doesn't care about you, William. All she cares about is having this baby. She's convinced you to sell your soul with her so she can get it. You're right. All Val cares about is having a child of her own. But the only reason she's this desperate, this out of options is because of me. - What do you mean? - You wouldn't understand. - It's pill time. - William, wait. Help me understand. Please. When I was in my residency... the long hours, the stress, I developed a problem... Painkillers. I probably wouldn't have made it. But then I met Val, and she saved me. I went from using multiple times a day to just... every so often when I'm relaxing at home, you know, recreational. Then one night, I get a call that one of my patients, this little boy, he was suffering complications after surgery. I couldn't help him, and he died. His family sues the hospital. They lose millions. And just like... Just like that, my career, gone, and, along with it, any chance of me and Val adopting a kid of our own. When you have a reputation of a... child killer... it lands you pretty low on the list at the adoption agency. Through all of that... Val stayed by me. So I have to stand by her now, however she decides this needs to go. You're not a killer, William. I know you didn't mean to hurt that boy. Don't make the same mistake. You still have time to do the right thing. We don't all get second chances. Now... am I gonna have to force this on you? Thank you. William, wait. This stuff makes me really thirsty. Do you think you can loosen this a little bit so I can drink the water myself? Come on. Please. All right. There, how's that? Thank you. It's pitch-black out here. I can barely see the road in front of me. We should call it a night. - What? - No, Ava's still out there. But we're not gonna be any help to her if we end up wrapped around a tree. I saw a B&B in town. We'll go there, get a good night's sleep, and then we can go down this list first thing tomorrow. Bed and breakfast? Separate rooms, obviously. I don't know. Ava could need our help right now. God, you're just like her! You're always talking back, always thinking you're the smartest one in the room. See, the Stargazer Inn... It's just up the road. I'll drive you back to your car, follow you from there. Are you okay? What kind of question is that? You've become infatuated with her. All right, now, don't be ridiculous. How long does it take to shove a pill down someone's throat? Just because we're doing what we're doing doesn't mean we need to be cruel. Cruel? What do you know about cruelty? Val. William, this is my life. This child is everything I have ever wanted. And not you, not her, not anyone is gonna take that away from me. So I'm gonna ask you, Will... are you okay? Are you with me all the way? All the way. I don't believe you. Show me. And we're back with the news and weather at the top of the hour. Folks can continue cleaning up from last week's storms... Come on, Shane. As we can expect several days of sunshine. In darker news, police are investigating the brutal slaying of a local man, Kyle Petrose, who was stabbed to death in his own apartment. Authorities believe that he was killed some time in the middle of the night. - There you are. - It's about time. Slept through my alarm. - Beautiful. - Let's not waste any more time. Am I riding with you? Sure. Get in. Whatever you say, boss. Got the first address? Yeah. All right, let's go find out what they know. Wow, if you could believe it, you're the first man to ever actually bring me breakfast in bed. Well, I know the circumstances aren't ideal, but I do hope you enjoy it. Are you gonna feed me again? Come on. Okay... just this once... Only because it's my specialty, and I'm very interested to know what you think. Thanks. Mmm, that's good. I mean, it's really good. Yeah? I would have never guessed you can cook. You know, I do still have a few good traits about me. Not many but a few. William, I... I know you want to help me. But after what you said yesterday, I understand what's standing in your way. And I can only assume... Well, I know I don't have many meals like this left in my future, do I? That's what I thought. So I appreciate you making this for me. I do have one request, though. Share a drink with me. I can't think of a time I needed one more than right now. I've got some bourbon in my office. Ooh. That works. All right, I'll be right back. Mm-hmm. - Ooh. - Do you need ice? - No. - I always like this straight. Yeah, me too. This is my own secret... private stash. You know, this is just so good. I don't want it to get cold. Sure. Oh, my God, that was so hot. - Oh, my God. I'm so... - I was not expecting that. - I'm sorry. - Okay, I'll be... I'm gonna... You know what? Uh, I'm gonna go get you new one. No. No, it's okay. I think I'm done. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - I'm sorry about that. - I should have cooled it down. I'm so sorry. Uh... Uh... You know what? A toast? Sure. To what could have been. To what could have been. Not bad, right? Yeah, not bad at all. - Another? - Hell, yes. What would have you done if you hadn't become a doctor? Wow, there's a question. Uh... Pssh, I don't know. I haven't thought about it in a long time. Come on, there has to be something. Okay. It's... it's stupid. Come on, it's right there on the tip of your tongue. I always wanted to be a-a rock star. What? I used to... I used to love that guitar, man. You couldn't rip it out of my hands. Hmm. William the rock star... - yeah, I can see it now. - Yeah? Yeah. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll. I'm sorry, I, uh... I feel a little... weird. What's wrong? Ava, you didn't. No, Ava, you... Ava, no. No, don't... Come on. Ava. Oh, God. Ava, wait. Ava, don't do this. Don't move. Did you really think it was gonna be that easy? - Is William dead? - No. Move. Go on. Shh, shh, shh. Turn around. Let's go. Turn around. Move. Sit. You know, the last time we sat here, we discussed your bright new future. But you've gone and ruined that, just like you did with your last life. You really are a waste. Last time we sat here, I didn't realize what kind of bitch you were. You do understand that we could have taken your life after the birth. But we didn't. We tried to make this work. Yeah, you're a real saint. You told me that you liked architecture. But I didn't tell you what drew me to it, did I? It's the symmetry, the perfection of it. The concept that something can be drafted and imagined and made concrete just as you first envisioned it. And then once that design moves from the drafting table into the real world, that's when things get dangerous. A strong foundation is the first requirement for success, like a strong marriage. And once that's done, there is still one element left to make sure that project is a complete success. And do you know what that is? - No. - Potential. How will the building be occupied? Who will live in it? How will it bring joy to those who come by and pass through it? That baby, my baby is the potential. And I'm not gonna allow some weak, little crossbeam to destroy my foundation. - Baby! - Yes, William. Look out, she's loose! Yes, William. I'm still curious as to know how she set herself free. Okay. Let's... let's think about another way. Grow up, William. Get the ties! Get the ties and get the stuff! Get those ties. Go. Get her downstairs. Get her there. Can I help you? Um, I'm so sorry to bother you, but it's kind of urgent. My name is Lilla, and this is Shane. And we're looking for my sister. She went missing in this area earlier this week. And we've just been going door to door asking if anybody might have seen her. Uh, no. I haven't seen anything out of the ordinary. Val, you? No. Our neighborhood is usually pretty quiet. Are you sure? No strange car in the area or people you might not recognize? No. Sorry, I wish we could be more help. Well, that's okay. - Thanks for your time. - Mm-hmm. Um, if you do happen to hear anything, if you could please give me a call. This is my number. - I hope you find your sister. - Thanks. Uh, you two have a good day. Help! Downstairs! Okay. Easy. What the hell have you two done with her? I can explain. Lilla? Lilla? - What is going on? - What did they do to you? - There's no time. - You have to get this off me. I'm trying to help... Wait. Wait. You came for me. - Of course. - You're my sister. - We need to go right now. - That woman, she has my baby. We have to save her. This is the only way out. Come on. Okay. Aah! Oh, God. Oh, thank God. Shh, shh, Mama's gonna get you out of here. Okay, we got go. The car's parked out front at the end of the driveway. We're gonna have to make a run for it. - You ready? - Ready. Babe, babe, babe. Call an... call an ambulance. William, I can't... the police. Okay, okay, okay, okay. My bag, my bag. - I can't. - William, I have to go. I'll come back for you. I'll come back. - No, no, no. - No! - Quick, into the trees. - We're almost at the car! We're never gonna make it. She's right behind us. We're never gonna outrun her. We have to do something. Tired of running? Good, 'cause I'm tired of chasing you. Now bring the baby to me. I won't ask you again. Now hand over the baby. If you want her that badly, then here, catch. Don't move. What do we do with her? We'll take her back to the house. We can lock her up and then call the police, then get the hell out of here. You, get up. It's a nice trick you pulled back there, Ava. Didn't think you had it in you. I'm impressed. - Shut up. - Where'd you hide the baby? Oh... You know you could have never given it the life I could have given it. You're absolutely right. No one deserves you as a mother. I came so close to having the perfect designed life. You ruined everything. You're gonna pay. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. I won't let anyone hurt you, ever. What do we do now? Let's go home. What is he doing here? - Shane? - He was worried about you. He was out here looking for you, too. He helped me find you. Lilla, you don't know what he's capable of. Why would you say something so hurtful like that? I know things haven't been perfect, but we love each other. And you left me, remember? Do you know what that feels like? But I'm willing to forgive you because we're a family and we belong together. Our baby daughter... Just let me see her. Does she look like me? - Just bring her over here. - No. - Bring her over here. - No. You're not thinking straight. You can't make it on your own. Trust me. I'm sorry our lives didn't turn out the way you wanted. But I have to leave you. Please, just let us go. You're not ready to be a father. You're wrong. I lost you, but I'm keeping my daughter. No. Ava, run! - You can't get away. - I'll find you! I'll always find you! She's my daughter, too, Ava! Oh, no, you don't. - Why are you doing this, Ava? - Stay away from me. What are you gonna do with that, huh? You're so stupid. So stupid. And the funny thing is, is you always thought you were so much better than me. Didn't you? So much smarter. I'm smart enough to know that my daughter deserves better than you, and so do I. Well, we'll see about that. Ava... second chance. Hi. Hi. Hi. Ava. I thought you were dead. Do you need to go to the hospital? No, it just grazed my leg. And I found this. Hi. Hi, sweetheart. Oh. It's finally where it needs to be. Hope. You decided on a name? Yeah. Hello, little Hope. I'm your aunt, Aunt Lilla. Aunt Lilla loves you. You're a natural. It's easy when she's this cute. Yeah! - Hey, I'm home. - Hey. Are you still gonna watch Hope while I'm at rehearsals? - Of course I am... - I wouldn't miss getting to see this little face for the whole world. How's the play going? Fabulously. I can't wait for y'all to see it opening night. Oh, and Mom and Dad said they'd be here at 7:00. Can you grab some dessert on your way home? You got it. I hate this part. She's in good hands. Say bye, Mommy. We love you. I love you, too.
