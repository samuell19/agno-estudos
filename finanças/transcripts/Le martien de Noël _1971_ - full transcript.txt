(downbeat music) - I'm gonna beat you there. - Oh yeah? - See, I told you so. - You're in the middle of the street. Get over here. There, that's better. Come on, slowpoke. Hey, are we gonna have fun this vacation. - Yeah, two weeks. - Go on, keep moving. (shouting) Watch out. Come on, hurry up, will you? Ah, I wish mom would let me go by myself. - Ha, look, I made it here. - Oh yes. Ah, you're not coming with me to get a tree later. - I am so. - No you're not. - Mommy said I could. - Well, you'd better walk faster. Come on, get a move on. (giggling) - [Cathy] Come on, Frankie, let's get the groceries. - How about these cookies? - [Cathy] Oh yeah. - Ah, Cathy and Frankie, good morning. - [Cathy and Frankie] Good morning. - Well, do you want something else besides this? - [Frankie] A box of turkey stuffing please. - Uh-huh. Anything else? - [Frankie] A pint of cottage cheese. - Cottage cheese, all right. (mysterious music) (woman screaming) - Off from school, huh? - [Cathy] Yes sir. - [Frankie] Yes, we're on vacation. - Ah, and having fun in the snow, I see. So you have everything? - Yes sir. (man laughing) - Operator, please, the police! I'm being robbed, hurry, hurry! (sirens blaring) (tires screeching) (brakes screeching) - Hey kids, did you see a big man in a raccoon coat with a fur hat? - [Kathy] Yes sir, at the store. He was making funny noises and blowing bubbles. - Eh? - Smart kid. - Watch out for your hand there. (siren blaring) (upbeat music) - [Frankie] Nice of you to give us this lift, Mr. Framer. - Oh, it's all right. (laughing) Whoa, whoa there, Roamer. Hey Frankie, how'd you like to drive for a while? - [Frankie] Oh wow, can I, Mr. Framer? - Sure. (laughing) - Giddy up, Roamer, let's go. (downbeat music) - [Mr. Framer] Well, this the heaviest snowfall we've had in years. - I never saw so much snow. - Everything all right up there? - Oh, I'm fine, how about you? - Glad to have a chaffeur. - You drive well, Frankie. - Thanks. ♪ Oh what fun it is to ride ♪ ♪ In a one horse open sleigh ♪ You wanna drive a while? - I'm too comfortable here. - Was he serious? - Well of course he was serious. Why wouldn't he be? After all, that thing-- - Hey, hush, hush, here, listen, listen. - [Announcer] Story about flying saucers this morning. - Our peaceful community has recently come to the attention of interplanetary space travelers or so some people are saying. Several residents have reported seeing strange objects in the sky last night. Our brave police believe it must be some kind of holiday prank. - I bet you what there were seeing was Framer's prized goose. (laughing) - Oh sure, go ahead, it's a joke. Sure, but I saw it I tell you. - Must've been his goose. (siren blaring) (mysterious music) (man whistling) - You going somewhere, ma'am? Maybe you want a taxi. Every place in town's a flat rate, out of county ... (popping) (upbeat music) - [Cathy] Are you gonna let me chop a little bit? - [Frankie] No, you can't, it's too dangerous. You've gotta be careful with an ax. Daddy showed me how. Maybe when you're bigger. - [Cathy] Should we get one of those over there? - [Frankie] No, silly, they were only planted a couple years ago, that whole section. - Oh yeah, I remember when daddy did that. We'll get a nice wide one though, won't we? - [Frankie] Yeah. (mysterious music) Here's another steep one. I can ski down it. - [Cathy] On snowshoes? Oh, isn't this fun? - [Frankie] Yeah. And this one's even steeper. - [Cathy] Yeah, yeah it is. - [Frankie] Look how the snow covers everything. - [Cathy] I hope we don't sink in. - [Frankie] Yeah, it's like walking on the moon. - [Cathy] You think there are people living on the moon? - [Frankie] If there are, they'd better be Eskimos if it's like this. (laughing) - [Cathy] Is this still part of daddy's farm, Frankie? - [Frankie] Certainly. That one, that one looks pretty good. - [Cathy] Oh yeah, that one's pretty good. - [Frankie] We'll plant another one in the spring to take its place. - [Cathy] Oh yes but be careful with the ax. - [Frankie] I told you daddy showed me how, didn't I? - [Cathy] Isn't it lucky we live on such a big farm so we don't have to buy a tree? - [Frankie] Yeah. I think I'd better trim it a little on the bottom first, before I cut it. - [Cathy] All right Frankie. I'll hold it for you so it doesn't fall over. - [Frankie] There. Get out of the way, Cathy, it's coming down. I'll finish it now. - [Cathy] It's a beautiful tree. Mommy's gonna be very happy. - [Frankie] It's gonna be fun getting this home and trimming it too. Okay, pull. - [Cathy] Heavy. - [Frankie] Don't start complaining now. It's a long way home. (downbeat music) - [Cathy] Hey, you're not pulling. - I am too. Hey, look at those footprints. We'll leave the tree here and come back for it later. - [Cathy] They're so big and green. Who could make green footprints? - [Frankie] It wasn't an animal and it couldn't be people. - And they go all the way up the hill to that tree there. There's something funny about that tree. - Yeah, I might just be imagining it. Look, Cathy, do you see anything behind the tree like somebody hiding behind it? - Let's go find out. - [Frankie] Yeah, come on. - [Cathy] It's running away. - After it, come on! - Hurry, Frankie, hurry! - I'm going faster than you. (whimsical music) - [Cathy] So he's the one who made these green footprints. - [Frankie] Remember when we saw him before? - [Cathy] Sure, he's the man that was in the store making bubbles. - [Frankie] Well, we'll find him. And we'll just follow his tracks til we find him. - [Cathy] Frankie, the footprints end here. - Looks like he must've just flown away. - Here's a giant match. I'm gonna try and light it on my snowshoes. - Put that down, Cathy, you know you're not supposed to play with matches, you know that. (shouting) (suspenseful music) Come back here, Cathy, come back! Cathy, come back! Don't go so high, Cathy! Come back here! I'm gonna tell mommy! Come back here! Do you hear me? Cathy! Don't go so high! Cathy, Cathy, come back, come back here, Cathy! Cathy, come back. Cathy! Cathy! Please come down, Cathy. Cathy, come back, come back Cathy! - Frankie, I'm getting scared. How do I get down? - Throw that thing away. The snow is soft. - You know you're not supposed to play with matches. - Well at least we know why there were no more footprints now. Let's look around some more. - All right, over this way. (laughing) - Tell a better story than that. - That's the tallest tale I've ever heard. But gentlemen, my story's true or I never would've breathed a word about it. Except from what I've heard from both of you. Your bubble-maker in a great fur coat and I'm not forgetting your grandmother with a flying match, Bert. About midnight last night and the sky was perfectly clear but I didn't feel so much for sleeping. I was hungry. You know, it happens sometimes. So I got up out of bed and a beautiful clear night and I walked down to the kitchen quietly so I wouldn't wake Maria. You know how she is about my midnight snacks. (mysterious music) Suddenly I look out the window and there's an egg in the sky, a great glowing egg, drifting across the sky. It was right above your cornfield. All of a sudden, it dropped out of sight behind a hill. I jump up. In a flash, out of my house, onto my porch. I look around. Would you believe it, the biggest egg I've ever seen vanished without a trace? Nowhere, not a sign of it. The biggest egg I ever seen. Anyone ever seen. It would've won first prize at the county fair. Vanished without a trace. This egg would've weighed a half a ton. The hen wouldn't have fit in the hen house. (men murmuring) A prize egg. And you don't believe me. - Wow! Look at that. A flying saucer. What's it doing here? Oh wow! - [Cathy] Oh Frankie, should we be scared? - Scared of what? Come on, they're probably friendly. I wonder how come it landed here, in the old gravel pit near this old machinery. - [Cathy] Gee Frankie, I'm getting frightened now. - [Frankie] What's there to be afraid of? Look, it's just a flying saucer like on TV. See how round it is, the lights around the edge. - [Cathy] Look Frankie, there's nobody around. - [Frankie] So what, silly? They're all inside probably. - [Cathy] Do you think it's really a flying saucer? - [Frankie] Of course it is, it's round and there's the antenna up there, just like on television. - [Cathy] Can we go inside, Frankie, can we? - [Frankie] After we find the door. Come on, let's get these snowshoes off. And we'll look for a way to get in. You go around that way, Cathy, and see if you can find the door. I'll go this way, and be careful. - I'll be careful. Oops. Frankie. Where are you? Frankie. Frankie. Where are you? - Then look what's been happening lately. Strange things going on around here. Now you weren't lying, right? You, of course not. Now let me make my point. Now first of all, why don't you wanna believe me? - Oh look now, you're not going to fool us, Framer. - I'm sorry, Cathy, I couldn't hear you with the noise that thing's making. I found the door. It's a round hole. You wanna go in? - [Cathy] Yeah, I guess so. - Hello, is anybody there? - We're friends, don't be frightened. Don't be afraid, we're friends. - You can go in first. - Nah, you can go, I won't mind. - All right, we'll choose. Eeny meeny miny moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers, let him go. My mother told me to pick this here one. You win. (whirring) - Is there anyone around? (beeping) (buzzing) (laughing) - You can laugh at me, all of you, but it wasn't an egg, it was something much more dangerous. - It's against the law too. Besides that. (whirring) (beeping) - [Frankie] Stop, Cathy, it's a ray gun! - In local news, the sheriff's office has just issued the following bulletin regarding the unidentified flying object. Despite all the strange events of a holiday season, there are no further reports of any flying saucers. (mumbling) was just a holiday prank. - I'm worried, the children didn't get home for lunch yet. - Well, they're on vacation, aren't they? Let them have their fun while they can. (whirring) - [Cathy] No, it's not a ray gun! Those are bullets! (beeping) - [Frankie] Oh, I'm not hurt. It stopped. Cathy. Cathy. You alive? - [Cathy] I think so. It's candy, Frankie, candy! - [Frankie] Candy? - [Cathy] Candy! - [Frankie] Candy! (laughing) Come on, Cathy, come on! (beeping) - [Cathy] Look, it's cleaning up the place! Just like a vacuum cleaner. (speaking in alien language) Is that the way he talks, Frankie? - [Frankie] Yeah. I bet he's from Mars or Jupiter or some place. (speaking in alien language) (laughing) - He wants us to speak. - Well all right. My name is Frankie (mumbling) and I'm in the seventh grade. (both children chattering) Because we're on Christmas vacation and we were bringing a Christmas tree home when we first saw you. (bubbling) You think he's got the words in there, Cathy? Our language? Oh wow. Cathy, look. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - We, the people of the United States of America, in allegiance to the flag and to the republic for which it stands. There are many ways of talking among the people of your planet. Perhaps this is the one you understand. Ah, good. My name is Frankie Allen, her name is Cathy Allen. Go to school, on vacation, in seventh grade. Don't worry, I'll improve with practice. My dear young people. I wish to, well, greet you. Well. - Where'd you come from? - From a planet that is warmed by the same sun as yours. Yes, it's not far from here at all. Called (speaking in alien language). That's what we call it. I don't know what your name for it is because none of your people have ever visited us. - Do you plan to go back some day? - Oh, why, yes, I certainly plan to return. My children are there. They'll be wondering where I've been. I hadn't planned to stop here, no, not at all. It was an emergency, an emergency landing. - Is your saucer broken? - Saucer broken? You mean my marvelous machine? Preposterous, broken down. Well, yes it is. A matter of fact, it is. Look. (rumbling) - [Cathy] You get daddy's tools, Frankie, and I'll take care of getting something to eat. - [Frankie] All right but be quiet. - I'm getting worried about the children. Where would they be all this time? - They're on vacation so they're out having fun. - [Mother] Wouldn't it be a pity if the Santa Clause suit doesn't fit you anymore? (laughing) - Don't worry, it'll fit well enough. They'll never recognize me anyway. - [Reporter] Several peculiar things have happened around here lately. And without wishing to cause any unnecessary alarm, this radio station suggests watching out for prowlers who may be up to no good. And now, here's Clint (mumbling). - [Clint] Contains a mixture of cereals, antibiotics, and vitamins and minerals. - Wait! Wait for me! This is impossible. Your earth is so soft, I keep sinking into it. - That's not earth, it's snow. - I can't go on. - Do you wanna borrow my skis? Okay, let me get 'em off. (groaning) Here, put this on while I get the other one. - [Alien] How do I do this? - Here, it's simple. Look, you just put your foot in here. (upbeat music) (shouting) (laughing) (dog barking) Hi, Mr. Talbot. Are you going down past our old gravel pit? - [Mr. Talbot] Sure, hop on. (dog barking) (bells ringing) - It's a very comfortable ride. Yes, very. Not very fast though. Now wait a minute. I have a faster way. (whirring) (upbeat music) All done. I fixed it. Good, good. Well now. Protect your ears. Because the motor makes a terrible roar when it revs up. (whirring) (roaring) (sizzling) - I'll go see what's wrong. (clanking) - Oh, well, no wonder the poor thing wouldn't work. It's come apart, apart completely. That's a sad state of affairs. I can't fix this. (buzzing) - [Frankie] Hi, Uncle Henry, can you fix this? Uncle Henry? - Huh? Hi Cathy, Frankie. - Can you fix this for me? - Huh, what's this thing? - Wait, there's more. Here, this goes in here like this. - What is this, what's it from? - It's part of my electric trains. - Your electric train, ha, yeah, I bet. Watch your eyes now. Some electric train. (crackling) - [Frankie] You keep an eye on it so it doesn't fall off. Hey, look, let's borrow it. Uncle Henry won't mind. - Oh goodie! - He always let's me use it. - Wait, Frankie, let me tie the sled on. You know, a snowmobile can be dangerous. - Yeah, that's why you have to obey all the laws for snowmobiles and never do anything dangerous like speeding. (laughing) Here, Uncle Henry fixed it. - It's all fixed, it's all fixed! Good, good. (engine rumbling) Hey, this is fun! Hey, woo! (laughing) Hurray, Frankie! You drive well! Doesn't he, Cathy? - [Cathy] Don't go too fast, Frankie. - [Frankie] Don't worry. I won't. (church bell ringing) (piano organ playing) - [Alien] Hey, hey! Hey! Wee! Hey, hey! Wee! (laughing) - [Cathy] Hey, come on, come on! (whistling) (upbeat music) (shouting) - [Frankie] Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong. (laughing) - Wee! ♪ We are so glad ♪ ♪ A very, very merry day's begun ♪ ♪ Who can (muffled lyrics) ♪ ♪ Singing tra-la-la-la and shout hurray ♪ ♪ What a fling to play and sing all through the day ♪ ♪ Come everyone, sing tra-la-la-la ♪ ♪ And bring a friend ♪ ♪ Days full of fun should never, never, ever end ♪ (children shouting) What strange creatures. Those short beings with space helmets, which planet are they from? - Oh come on now, they're just from here, playing a game of hockey. - Huh, a game? But why are they all carrying swords and spears? - Those aren't spears, they're hockey sticks to push the puck around. - Oh, why of course. We have a game like that too. (children shouting) (laughing) - You see, they make a goal when they push the puck in. - The puck in the goal. I wanna play, hey, wait for me. Wait for me, wait for me! Wee! (upbeat music) (laughing) - [Child] Hey, where'd he come from? - [Child] What's this, who is this guy? He can't play! No fair, you've got an extra man! - [Cathy] Look, he's gonna score! (children shouting) - [Child] Hey, what's this, he's (mumbling)? - [Child] Oh, who cares, he's on our side. (children shouting) - [Child] You're open, shoot! - Oh rats, what luck. (shouting) - [Child] Everybody wins. - People on my planet thought the earth deserted. Yes. That there weren't any people here. We'd better get to work, huh? All right. Hand it down now. Easy. - As soon as he's finished and everything's fixed, ask him if he'll take us for a ride. - I will, yeah. (laughing) - All done. All done. All done, it's fixed. (laughing) We fixed it. Stand by for liftoff. Your ears, huh? All right, now here we go. (whirring) - Not again. (sneezing) - [Alien] That did it! Good, Cathy, good. It's starting up. (sirens blaring) - Hello Henry. You reported your snowmobile missing. It was parked outside of your garage and you believe somebody's stolen it, right? - Of course somebody stole it. What do you figure, you figure it just could've melted? I came down this morning, parked it right outside the door. What else could've happened? - Maybe it's stolen. I'll do what I can. (clanking) Henry, you like wasting my time like this, I'm gonna run you in. Come over here. Is that yours? - Well yeah, it's mine all right. It's the one that's missing. I told you it was stolen. (phone ringing) Hello? Chief! Come here! Now my snow plow's gone! - [Chief] Where was it? - Right there, and it's gone! Oy-yoy-yoy. - [Chief] This used to be such a nice, quiet town. (siren blaring) (laughing) - [Alien] Over here now, Frankie, bring it up here. - Beautiful. - Oh great, in a little while, we'll have this whole launch area cleaned up. Hey, good, that's fine, Frank. Very good, the way that you cleaned up the snow on my launchpad. That's just fine. Oh. But why'd you throw all the snow up on my poor saucer? Oh well, come on, give me a hand. Let's clean the snow off the thing. You be careful now. - [Frankie] All right. - [Cathy] I'm gonna wait inside. - Watch your step now, it's slippery up here. - [Frankie] Yeah, I will. - Hang on the antenna. (beeping) (buzzing) (whirring) (rumbling) Great galaxies, we're taking off! Hold on tight, Frankie, hold on. Help, help! Oh! - Oh, help. Stop. Stop. Oh, what should I do? Oh, oh. - [Alien] Help, help! I'm slipping, hold me, Frankie. - Cathy! - [Alien] Help, help! - [Cathy] Please, please go down. How do you do it? Oh please. - [Alien] Oh, I'm slipping, I'm gonna fall! Frankie, hold on, don't let go of me. - [Cathy] Please go down, please. - Hold on. - [Frankie] Cathy! - [Alien] Slipping. - [Frankie] Oh, it's going down. - [Alien] The guidance system put it right back on the pad. - Wait til I get you! - [Alien] Catch her! - [Frankie] Stop, come back here, you! (laughing) - [Alien] You should know a flying saucer is not a toy. (siren blaring) - Oh, if he thinks he can make a fool out of me. Henry. Is that your snow plow out there? You think we're some kind of fools? - Mm-hmm. - [Alien] Well now, would you like to go for a real ride? - Oh yes! - [Alien] Good, cover your ears. (whirring) - Impossible. There's nothing left of my turkey. - You've cooked it too long, eh? - Oh Fred, don't be foolish, the pan's empty. - Are you sure you put it in? - My Christmas turkey, oh. (flute whistling) - Bravo. - Bravo! (laughing) Perhaps you'd like to see some nice scenes of my planet. Watch the screen. - What's that, a car? - Oh my, no. No, it's only a toy for children. - And for grown-ups too. - Big people prefer moving around on their feet because it's much more fun that way. Of course, if we have to go a long way like a trip through space, then you, well you've, well you have to use one of these. - Wow, what's that? - Your word, house. - [Frankie] That's a house? - Ah yes, bees are marvelous builders so we let them build all our houses and they're excellent. (whirring) - Is that your planet? - Oh, it's beautiful. - That is just the right word, beautiful. That's a picture of your earth the way it looks from space. (whirring) - Your name, what is it? - Yeah, what is it? (whistling) (laughing) - And it's even funny in your language because it would mean, let's see, poo flower. - Poo flower? (laughing) - Poo flower. (laughing) - We've got a crime wave on our hands. A snowmobile was stolen, a snow plow and some tools. - What about that turkey, chief? Somebody stole that. And those green footprints, how do you figure that out? We've got a problem. - Give me that thing. Sheriff, we've got to get a lot of help. - We're going to speed up so brace yourself. Look. Through the visor now, look out there. - [Frankie] How dusty it all looks. Is that air pollution? - [Alien] Our visors are not adjusted to your atmosphere. I must apologize for the quality of the picture. - Where are we? - [Alien] This is your greatest desert. - The Sahara? - [Alien] Yes, in Africa. We're flying over Africa. - [Children] The Sahara! - That was the sheriff on the phone. It appears that there might be something to these reports about this flying saucer so we're forming a posse. - [Mother] A posse? - A search party really. We're just investigating. - Well I wish you'd investigate what happened to the children, they haven't been home since this morning. - First day of vacation, they'll be all right. Quit worrying about them. - That's easy for you to say. - But you must. Goodbye now. - Be careful. (whirring) (upbeat music) (laughing) - [Cathy] That's a funny one. (laughing) How did he do that? (laughing) - Can you tell me where we're going now? - [Alien] We're already there, the arctic. Look at the visor. See that ship down there? It's an icebreaker. - [Children] Where? - [Alien] Let's take a closer look. - [Frankie] Look at that, Cathy. - [Alien] We'll be over the pole in a few minutes and then we'll have to head back home. - [Frankie] The North Pole, really? - [Alien] Mm-hmm, right. And a few minutes after that, we'll be back home again. (whirring) We're almost there. We're coming over your town now. - [Cathy] Is that really our town? - Sure, there's the town hall. See it down there? - [Cathy] Oh yeah. Is this our school here? - [Frankie] That's it, that's the school right there. - [Cathy] Oh, it looks so nice from up here. - [Frankie] Yeah. There's the grocery store too. - [Cathy] Oh yeah. - Now you see this crossroad, Cathy? That's the road going to Watertown, where grandma lives. Way over there, see? - [Cathy] Oh, you can see so far from up here. - We're turning off. You know where we're going now? - [Cathy] To the launchpad, naturally. - [Alien] Be careful children. Hang on now, because we're going to start our descent pretty soon. (siren blaring) (chattering) - First of all, I wanna thank every one of you for being so helpful. There have been some mysterious things going on here in our village which are unexplained. (chattering) In open defiance of our laws. There are thefts, mysterious green footprints in the snow, and worst of all, unidentified flying objects violating our air space. This is criminal. Now we've had enough and we're gonna put a stop to it. That's right, 'cause if we don't, tomorrow, it'll get worse. (whirring) Saddle up, men, let's move 'em out. Remember, the eyes of the world are on you. (engines roaring) - Will you come back and visit us? - I wish I were able to know that. As for me, I'd like to return and visit your planet, talk with you children again, with Frankie here, your friends, and Cathy too. But who knows? Soon, you yourselves may be voyaging through space and you might come and visit with me. Anyhow, I have to go back to our planet. You know, I have a family there. I have a daughter and I have a son and I bet both of them are wondering where I am right now. How nice if one day you could meet them. (whirring) - [Frankie] Goodbye now. - [Cathy] Bye-bye, bye. - Adieu. (downbeat music) - [Cathy] Oh Frankie, it's so late. - [Frankie] Yeah, we'll hardly have time to trim the tree. - [Chief] This way, men, forward! Follow me! - Well, I'm sorry about the turkey but I-- - It's all right, this is fine. - I don't want anymore. - You must be hungry, eat up now. (whirring) - [Alien] Liftoff pre-check. (beeping) - There he is! (whirring) (speaking in alien language) (beeping) - [Chief] Quiet, quiet! - [Male] Ah, quiet yourself. (whirring) - To Aris, to Alpha Centauri, to Sirius. And now a periscope check of the launch area. Huh? Oh! Oh. (laughing) They're coming to say goodbye. Woo-hoo-hoo! (whirring) Hello, hello! (laughing) Hello, hello! Hello! - [Chief] Hey you, come down here! - Chief, chief, he's from outer space! - Hello! - Watch out, chief, she could fly away! - Hey, you there, come down. Come here now. You, you, wait. - Hey there friend. There's 52 professors who wanna meet you. You'd better come along peacefully or ... - [Alien] Woo, woo, woo, woo! - After him and take him alive! (chattering) - [Male] Wait for me, wait for me! Help, help, help! (shouting) - Over here! Hey, come on, over here! (laughing) - It's incredible. (men shouting) - [Male] Hey, you men, up here, he's up here! (men chattering) (upbeat music) - Hey, cut him off at the pass! We got him now! (laughing) - Now that's enough of this. You'd better come back with us or you'll answer to me! I'm responsible! (shouting) (downbeat music) (shouting) (men chattering) (murmuring) (shouting) - [Male] Hey, back off, back off, you guys. Don't smother him now. Easy now, give him some air, give him some air. Chief? (grunting) - [Male] Hey look, he's over here! (chattering) (crackling) (upbeat music) - Did you ever see anything like that before? (chattering) Chief! - [Cathy] Did you catch him, daddy? - [Frankie] Huh, daddy, did you? - Well, no. You kids are supposed to be in bed, aren't you? You wanna see Santa Clause? Now pop back in bed. - [Cathy] Goodnight. - [Frankie] Goodnight. - Goodnight darling. Did you find anything? - I'm not really sure. I'll tell you about it. (whirring) - Well, what happened? Did your men find anything? - Oh yes. - Hey, peek-a-boo! Yoo-hoo, I see you! (whimsical music) - Finally, I gave up and came home but the police are still following him, I know that. (crackling) (upbeat music) - [Dad] Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas! Here's Santa Clause to bring you your gifts. Here's one for you, Frankie, and here's one for you Cathy and there are lots more. - [Cathy] There's another Santa Clause! - [Dad] Who is that? - [Mom] What, what's going on? Come over here, children. - Merry Christmas. Here's Santa Clause to bring you your gifts. Hello children. - It's him, it's him, the flying saucer, call the police! Hurry up! (siren blaring) - [Male] Sorry, children, we're trailing a visitor from outer space. - [Chief] You're under arrest! - [Male] Hey chief, there's two of them! - [Chief] Huh? Well we're not taking any chances, take 'em both in. - [Dad] I'm innocent, he's the fake Santa Clause. - Oh, he is. More cuffs, chief. - [Dad] This is unbelievable, you know me! - I always get my man, even if there's two of them. (laughing) - [Radio] (mumbling) calling car two, car two come in. - [Male] This is car two. - [Radio] Oh, did you catch this guy? The professors are waiting to question him. - Yeah, we got him, sheriff. And we're bringing him in right now. - [Radio] You got him?
