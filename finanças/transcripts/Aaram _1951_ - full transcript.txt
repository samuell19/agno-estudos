You Tube - Video Running Time 01:46:45 You Tube search name - Aaram Why am I roaming on this lonely road at this hour of the night? You know why? I don't want to know. It's futile to follow me. Where do you want to go? Where do I want to go? I don't know that myself. I don't have any place. I don't have any destination. Wherever my feet tire, that'll be my destination. Wherever my strength gives out. But remember, don't let your body run down in front of my house. Otherwise, it'll get really difficult for a poor young man like me. Okay. Good luck. Thank you. This wretched rain. Yes. Otherwise I wouldn't have bothered you. It's not about being bothered. I live all alone. That's why... You're completely drenched. Better dry your clothes. There's a room there. - Have you put the clothes out to dry? - Yes. - Are you feeling cold? - No. - I would've told you if I was. - I mean... - What? - I was saying, it'll take a while for the clothes to dry. There's a trunk there. Get something from it. - Okay. - Good. Wow. The pants, they fit well. - Take a seat, eat something. - And you? I've eaten. I finished eating a while ago. You're lying. Your face tells a different story. The hunger that you see on my face... has always been there. Please, begin. Life's a yo-yo Yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo Life's a yo-yo Life's a yo-yo The restlessness of the yo-yo is the story of our life The ups and downs of the yo-yo is the story of our life Life without problems is meaningless, friends Problems are fun, says the yo-yo Life's a yo-yo Yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo Some are happy while some are sad There's a new farce everyday in this world All that's happening will continue forever, friend Keep walking like this yo-yo Life's a yo-yo Yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo, yo-yo What could be wrong? He's sleeping so soundly. Wake up, dear. Did you die before I could write you a policy, Shyam? Get up, friend. Look, our company has come out with a wonderful policy. What is this joke? Get up! Get up. Get up. My God! Your face looks wonderful in the light. Who are you? Your voice has changed as well. Strange. Who are you? Pardon me. I think I've entered the wrong house. - Who is it? - Shyam? What are you doing here? - Get up, this isn't your house. - This is my house. Who is she? You fool, she's a lady in distress... and she didn't have a place to spend the night. And I gave her a place to stay. I thought you got married to her. And now I'll have to call her sister-in-law. You know, I feel so shy calling anyone sister-in-law. - Good morning. - Good morning. He's my friend, Mr. Chaman Lal. - Good morning. - Good morning. - I'll take your leave now. - Have tea first. - Hot tea. - Why are you taking the trouble? I'll prepare the tea. There's no sugar, milk or tea in the house. - What to do? - I don't have any money, either. - Matches? - Matches. No need to prepare tea here. - Let's go to the coffee house. - No, we'll drink it here. - No, we'll go to the coffee house. - No, here. - You better change. We'll go to the coffee house. - Okay. - Hello. - Hello, professor. - Hello. - Shyam, you grab a seat. - I'll go meet the professor. - Okay. I'll get tea for you as well. Thankfully, if not us... at least someone settled down. Waiter, two cups of tea. It's a nice place. But the people here look strange. Yes, Leela, everyone comes here... to drown their sorrows in a cup of tea. See, Professor, Shyam is sitting with such a beautiful lady. Might be. Many came here and left. But no one ever noticed them. - Did you sleep peacefully last night? - Yes. You fell asleep while I was narrating the story. So what? The story has just begun. It's my only desire. I pray... that you always stay before my eyes, and I look at you That you always stay before my eyes... Baby. This is Baby, the daughter of the owner... of this coffee house, Mr. Ramnath. - And you? - She's my friend. You've become so mischievous. So I made another friend. I've some business to attend. I'll return this evening. Until then you stay at home. - Chaman, drop her home. - Me? - Please. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Grandma. Shyam. - Why did you come here? - For no reason, grandma. - How's your work going? - Very well. People are pouring in to buy my pictures. One says, 'I'll pay 100' while the other says 'I'll pay you 200.' And, grandma, in the end they keep fighting... and my pictures don't sell. But, grandma, one day they'll surely sell. And I'll earn so much money... you won't have enough room to store it all. Yes. Oh yes, Grandma, on that note I remembered. I need 100 rupees for my makeup. Why not 200. Trying to fool me. I know you too well. That pouring of people at your door... which you always tell me about... aren't buyers but your creditors. I don't have anything left. I gave you everything I had. I've been severely ill myself for the past four days. You couldn't even call the doctor. Grandma. I slapped you unnecessarily. But, son, I do it only for your own good. Grandma, I'm not crying because you slapped me. It's because you love me so much. Now I'll make myself worthy. - Shyam, when did you come back? - Just now. - What's wrong? You look sad. - No. Life's a yo-yo What happened? Did you two have a fight? I don't owe you anything... so why are you two looking at me like that? I get it. I've the solution to your problems. This. Yo-yo. It teaches us to go around. Meet people. You aren't going to make any money sitting at home. Come on, I'll take you to Paris Hotel... to lighten your mood. - There's a wonderful program. - What are you blabbering? I don't have the proper clothes or any money. - And he wants to go to the Paris Hotel. - You didn't get it, did you? You didn't understand Chaman even after eight years of friendship. Leave all that to me. Come on. Life's a... - Yo-yo. - Yes. Life's a... - Who's the owner of this shop? - Yes? - You're the owner of this shop? - Yes, what can I do for you? Nonsense. Your servants are insolent. When I asked them 'where's the owner'... they lifted their heads like this. They have no manners. Forgive me. It was a mistake. - Fine, I forgive you. - Thank you. A nice suit for him... - and a beautiful sari for her. - Very well, sir. Suit for the lady and sari for the sir. Oh, no, no, no, suit for the sir and sari for the lady. Sir, please come in. Hey, come here. Wow, Chaman; you truly are unique. - I've arranged for everything, sir. - Very good. But who are you? You don't know that. Another insolent man. He's Delhi's famous wealthy man, Mr. Ram Prakash. The owner of numerous mills. The president of cut-piece association. He's foraying into ready-made clothing now. - Sir is opening a store right beside you. - Curses. Here, right beside mine? - How is that possible? - You're talking about possibilities. I say it's happening. It's just a matter of few days. But, sir, what will you get by snatching my livelihood? Think about my children. Open your stores somewhere else. It'll be a great favor to me. Okay, we'll think about it. Oh yes, how much for these clothes? Tell me, quickly. What are you saying? I'll charge you money? - Consider them a humble gift from me. - Okay. Sir. Okay. Come, let's go. Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Bye. I don't go anywhere myself. I go wherever my secretary takes me. - So he makes your schedule. - Yes. I mean, do drop by my house someday as well. Yes, of course. - But... - Oh yes, discuss it with the secretary. - But do drop in. - Yes. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hurry up, bearer, hurry up. Here, your highness. The food was delicious. I really enjoyed it. - Did you enjoy it, Your Highness? - Yes, of course. - Bill, sir. - Send the manager. Don't you know the princess of Roopnagar is present here? Insolent. - At your service. - What service? What kind of hotel is this? No service or good food. The food itself is saying 'don't eat it, don't eat it.' - The inn at our kingdom is much better, your highness. - Yes, yes. We'll open another hotel right next to yours. We'll show everyone. Why open one right besides ours? Why not buy this hotel? We aren't making any profit. We lose thousands every month. Okay, we'll come back tomorrow and discuss about the hotel. Mister, this signature won't do. What now? Manager. Their bill. Excuse me, you don't have to pay the bill now. See? He finally realized his mistake. I can do the impossible. Let's go, your highness. Waiter, show me that five rupees note. There's no harm in showing it. - But, sir... - I was just joking. Don't you understand that? Bye. See you, Your Highness. - I had a wonderful time today. - Really? - Thank you. - Why thank me? - See you, prince. - Shut up. Don't waste time in useless blabber. Now tell me, what should I do about her? - Listen, can you keep her with you? - No, no, no. I can't do anything without my wife's permission. She already doubts my character. - Yes, let me ask her and I'll let you know. - Okay. Let's go, driver. Mr. Shyam, I don't know whether I can ask you or not. But, you were so quiet the entire time. You didn't enjoy the program at the hotel, either. What's wrong? What can I say, Leela? Life plays a joke with some people. And today's charade was a part of that mockery as well. Just think. You have fame, fortune, respect all around you... but you can't reach out and grab it. What could be a bigger joke? Do you... like wealth as well? I don't want wealth, Leela. Grandma is ill in the village... and I can't afford proper treatment for her. I can't share your sorrows. Don't worry about me, Shyam. You've already done a lot for me. You supported me... when no one lent me a helping hand. You opened your doors when I had nowhere to go. That isn't anything great, Leela. It's easy to help someone up. But it's difficult to see that they don't fall again. Let's not talk about this. You must be tired. Get some sleep. My wife has agreed. My wife has agreed. - Listen to me. - What is it? My wife has agreed to let Leela stay at our house. That's strange, because your wife... Look here, don't say anything about my wife. It's a very sensitive matter. And my wife is your... sister. - Mr. Ramnath, come in. - Come in. So, what brings you here? Baby said that there's a lady staying with you. I thought of hiring her to look after my daughter. Otherwise my hotel will be ruined. Here comes another candidate. Look, I've brought the first proposal. You might've, but I decided long back. 'I've decided' you're no judge. - Who are you? - Me? I... almost own the insurance company. And I'm the sole owner of a hotel. - So, you can't harm me. - I'll stop giving you credit. Did you hear that? Didn't I tell you that he's an idiot? - What did you say? - Nothing. Why are you two arguing? Let's ask the person herself. - Yes, that's right. - No, that's absolutely right. What does she say? Tell us. You don't need to think so much. If you want to say it in private, we'll ask him to leave. Why me? You leave. - You. - You. - Fine, don't go. Shyam, what does she say? - She left. - How is that possible? She really left. She couldn't endure the tears in my eyes. Maybe she's gone out for some urgent work... - and might come back to the hotel. - Yes, Shyam. Let's return to the hotel. I don't see her anywhere. You really fooled us posing as the princess. Anyway, you did the right thing by coming here. I needed someone like you. Someone I could keep with me... like a companion and not a servant. I'm so fortunate that you thought I was worthy of it. You aren't the only one fortunate. I'm too. You don't know how lonely I feel here. You feel lonely in such a big house. Big house? This house was once so lively. But since he passed away... the grandeur of the house faded as well. Now his memory dwells in every element of this house. See that pipe lying there? It feels like he'll come in and say... 'Sita, the tobacco was right here. Is it gone?' And I'd reply, 'No, there's still more left in the house.' There are servants in the house. Yet, I'll bring the tobacco for him. He'll light his pipe. Mischievously blow out the smoke in my face. I'll get upset. And he'll placate me. Now, I get upset and placate myself as well. Sitting here, I call out... 'Sweetheart, come back.' 'Blow the smoke in my face again.' 'I won't get upset this time.' But... Forgive me. Instead of making you happy, I made you sad. No, Leela. You heard me out, I feel very light. That's enough for me. Hear that music? That's my son, Kumar. He stays lost in his own world. He has some grievances against life. Wonder what they are? His eyes keep constantly probing. Wonder who they search for? Come, I'll introduce you to him. Fall in love with someone Oh handsome one, oh handsome one Fall in love with someone Find a companion Oh handsome one, oh handsome one Fall in love with someone Love someone, be someone's love And turn this life into a beautiful dream lnto a beautiful dream Add some joy your life Oh handsome one, oh handsome one Fall in love with someone Love torments you, makes you suffer It makes the heart restless The tormented soul happily endures the anguish Happily endures the anguish Love is unique Oh handsome one, oh handsome one Fall in love with someone He is my son Kumar and she is the princess... whom you met at the hotel yesterday. You have lit up my house by coming here. I'm also glad to come here. I'm thankful to you for giving me this honor. Now I wish to stay here. I don't like to stay at my empire. I'll be more thankful to you. Why have you come so stealthily? I'm your thief, Grandma. I'm unable to do anything till now. Isn't it enough, whatever you've done, son? Don't embarrass me, Grandma. You don't know how helpless I am. What helplessness? You've send Rs.100 after all. I didn't send it. You're fooling me. The postman gave me the money order yesterday. It must be someone else's, Grandma. No, son. He said my son sent it. Look here. I've given Rs. 5 to the grocer and five to the doctor. It totals Rs. 90. Count it. - It seems some girl's handwriting. - What? - I understand. Leela sent it. - Who's Leela? There's this girl, Grandma. She's very nice. I'll bring her to you. Please sit. You've not yet freshened up. - Where are you going now? - No, Grandma, I'm going. What do you want? Ramnath, did Leela come here? Why would she come? Love is like a game of hide-n-seek, buddy. If she's gone, she'll return, too. I may have guessed wrong, Leela. But I think it must be something important... which has made you so upset. What should I say, Mr. Kumar? I myself don't understand. That's what I'm asking. What don't you understand? Tell me. Perhaps I can help you. You don't want to tell me. I thought you considered me as your dear one... and you'd tell me everything. - But... - It's not so, Mr. Kumar. There are a few things which must be endured but not said. Please, come back Leela. Please, come back. So, you've forgiven my mistake. Which mistake, Shyam? It was my mistake that I left without informing you. No, Leela. Now I've come to know that you had gone for me. Now you've returned for me. It was my fault I didn't understand. No. You aren't at fault. One says such things only when he loves a person dearly. You have become mine. These curly tresses, these half-asleep eyes... these weeping-smiling lips, they've become mine. Mine. Yes, Shyam. What do you know. I was so desperate to become yours. And I was so impatient to make you mine. As soon I separated from you, each step became a destination. And every moment a year. My condition was the same. You took along my sleep on moonlight nights. I used to talk with the walls and clung to those things... which you had blessed with your hands. Come on, Leela. Let's give this good news to grandma too. You go to the station. I'll seek permission from the queen and come there. Okay? Grandma, this is Leela. - How are you, dear? - I'm fine, Grandma. - And how are you? - I'm fine too, Grandma. I'm great. Not regarding my work but yes... Come in, dear. Grandma, do you like Leela? Yes, Son. I like her very much. So should I think she has passed? - She's passed but you've failed. - Why, Grandma? Until you've found work, I won't consider you passed. What should I do, Grandma? I couldn't get any work. Why don't you get it? If you'll take care of our 50 acres of land we'll become rich. What will you get by making portraits? The moon and moonlight are upset Tell me, who will placate them? Lord Kanha and his flute are upset How can anyone sing a song? The moon and moonlight are upset Make the deal of love with love Give your heart in return for mine The heart and eyes express different feelings How can anyone fulfill the custom of love? The moon and moonlight are upset Look, the black clouds have vanished The moon is shining. The flute is playing again The heart has agreed but love still insists Who will call the latter first? - Leela. - Go away. You get upset over nothing. What a shame! It was a matter to get angry, darling. Grandma stops me whenever I talk about the painting. She has no objection with paintings. She wants you to run any business and get settled. I also want to fulfill grandma's desire. Our dreams should also come true. But I can't ruin your innocent life... with my worthless life. How can my life be different from yours, Shyam? Yes, I don't want to become a burden to you. So what should I do? There's one option, Leela. A painting competition is going to be held in the city. I'll enter it. If I'm unsuccessful in that, too... I think we're not destined to unite. But do you hope you'll be successful in this? Yes, Leela. If only someone could enter me in the competition. What if I do it? How? Through the queen. Okay? Yes, Leela. If you're able to do this, our world will change. Let's go and tell grandma. I've heard everything, son. Yes, Queen. But no one knows him. The world runs after famous names... but doesn't give a glance to that poor man... who can't earn a single meal through his work. If you wish, you can help him. You can change him from an unknown to someone with glory and fame. But how? Please, enter his painting in the painting competition... which is going to be held here. Please, send it somehow. All right. I'll send if I like it. Oh, I'm so happy. I'll go and give him this good news now. You? You overheard our discussion? No. I was waiting for you to return... so I could express my desire to buy this painting. - You're fond of paintings, too? - Of course. But right now I want to buy it for the sake of my friend. She's very fond of it. It is so lovely. What is its price? Price? It's very valuable. The good things are priceless too, Leela. The painter paints such a painting... which is priceless before pearls, too. We can just pay its price. - Is rupees 200 enough? - 200? Yes. All right. I'll give you the money. Leave it with me. Leela, I was thinking what should I paint and you arrived. - I've come to give you good news. - What? Kumar has bought that painting to gift it to his friend. - Really? - Yes. And the queen will send your new painting for the competition. - But only if she likes it. - I agree. - I'll paint your portrait. - My portrait? I can't put life in anyone else's portrait than yours. Sit. Sit before me. - Shyam, I've to go. - No, you can't go, Leela. - I have to go. - Sit. Leela, I want to see the same expression on your face... I saw on our first meeting. That was not a smile or grief. Neither was it disappointment nor hope. Neither was it darkness nor brightness. It was a shivering glow of a flame... which is seen on the union of day and night. Yes, good. Good. Oh beloved, come and reside in my heart Come and settle in this ruined world, oh beloved My heart is impatient with love, oh sweetheart Come to give me the message of peace The firefly has been waiting... for so long Oh flame, don't delay, come to burn him My desperate eyes have a desire to see you Come to quench my thirst like the rains Oh beloved, come to reside in my heart Come and settle in this ruined world, oh beloved Leela, I'm very worried. I'm feeling worried too. Not because whether anyone will like the painting or not... but what if you forget me after gaining fame and glory? Leela, what have you said? I've painted it only to gain you. But I don't know what this painting will give us... life or death. Don't worry, Shyam. I can see the blushing smile... of a bride in this painting. Did you see it, Queen? It's so beautiful. It's excellent. You're so beautiful, so your painting ought to be pretty. Thank God you have liked it. Not only it, I've selected you too. I'm going to make you my daughter-in-law. Me? You're going to make me your daughter-in-law? Yes, Leela. You don't know how much Kumar loves you. He hasn't told you but I know his condition without you. I'm sure you like him, too. I do like him, Queen. He is so good that everyone will like and love him. But, Queen, I've never looked at him in that way. Do you have someone else in mind, Leela? Do you love Shyam? Yes, Queen. We'll get married on the success of this painting. You're going to marry Shyam? No. This is impossible. If it happens, then what about my son? If you wanted to do this, then why did you mislead him? Why did you break that poor fellow's heart? Why did you sing along with him? I didn't do anything purposely, Queen. No. You have deceived Kumar. You came to him as his destination... and now you're stepping back? You've done all this and now you're pretending to be innocent? Queen, I'm telling the truth. I don't know anything about it. I didn't do anything to make Kumar think so. I'll go and ask him. Mr. Kumar. I know why you've come here. You want to know whether I love you or not? Yes, I love you. But I never said that you love me too. And mother has forgotten this. She's my mother after all. This story begins on the day when... you jokingly came to me as the princess. A joke often becomes serious. I made you the queen of my heart from that day. My condition was that of a pauper... who used to visit the palace to beg. And when he raised his head, he saw the princess... sitting at the window and fell in love with her. But it's not the fault of the princess... but that unfortunate beggar. You were a princess and I a beggar. You were rich with beauty and I was poor lacking love. I stole each of your attributes. I stealthily drank the wine of your eyes. And I became so intoxicated. But what hangover is forever? Which intoxication doesn't fade? I'll get rid of this intoxication, too, one day. Give me time. Give me some time, Leela. Forgive me, Mr. Kumar. I don't know how and why it happened. I floated on water like an unaware lotus petal. But it was not water, but someone's tears... which I couldn't recognize. Never mind, Leela. You have loved. If not me then Shyam. I'll sacrifice my love for the sake of yours. Go, Leela. Forget this sorrowful story. Mother! What are you doing? Don't stop me, Kumar. I'll destroy this painting. This painting is the shadow of death for us. If I spare it, my motherhood will be snatched away. Your life will become lonely. If it is written in destiny, Mother, it will surely happen. No one's at fault for it. In fact, I'm at fault for falling in love without thinking. I don't want to know whose fault it is. I had tolerated the loss of my husband... but now I won't let my son's happiness be ruined. To shed tears and miss someone desperately is a great thing, Mother. Everyone dies over a burning flame. But not every lover has the courage to die over an extinguished flame. You were patient earlier, too, mother. Control you heart this time as well. If you want to make Leela your daughter-in-law... then consider Shyam as your son. Leela will become your daughter-in-law automatically. Congratulations, Shyam. From me too. This honor goes to you. I've got this honor because of you. I've become successful only with your help. No, Shyam, you worked hard and achieved success. Before you go to your village for your wedding... I want to throw a party at our place. - Sure, sure, queen. Definitely. - Let's go. Friends, I've been honored by the host... to thank you for attending this party. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks, oh love You've given such a beautiful sorrow to heart. Thanks Thanks, oh love Thanks. Thanks. Thanks, oh love The tears you gave to my eyes are no less than pearls You gave so many sorrows to my heart... that I don't have any sorrow now I'm grateful for whatever you have done. Thanks Thanks to you, oh love. Thanks. You've given life to the the sad songs You gave me the treasure of shattered hopes and desires I'm grateful to you for all your gifts. Thanks Thanks to you, oh love. Thanks I can understand, son. But it's better to tolerate the sorrow than to reveal it. You want me to become a puppet? I should laugh and cry on someone's command? What's wrong, Queen? Nothing, Leela. Nothing. I'm the reason for this sorrow. If I hadn't come to your home, you wouldn't be miserable. But perhaps this is also some riddle of sorrow or joy. Don't say that, Leela. If you have any respect for us... don't let this shadow of sorrow mar your happiness. Promise? And yes. Don't say all this to Shyam. Kumar, everyone wants to hear something from you. Come on. - Talat, you were fantastic. - Thanks. Friends, Mr. Kumar. Friends, now we will give you an amazing performance. Watch it carefully. Come to life, puppet. The puppet is ready with the power of magic and air. Now he'll speak with you. Listen. He talks so well. He speaks exactly like you. Yes, watch him. Oh, my God! Now watch. He'll drink tea before you. Friends, did you see my puppet can drink tea and speak? Now watch what he'll do next. Oh! Did you see? This is Leela's photograph. Get up. Look, I've brought such a beautiful outfit for my bride. Look. Take a shower and put it on. You have to leave from here exactly at 10. Shyam will be already waiting for you. Come on. It is spring time - It is spring time - Hello, Ramnath. Hello, Ramnath. Dear, first talk to me about my money. Forget money. Love is more important. - Is that so? - Hello professor. Brother Shyam, my father said... - you're an important man now? - What do you think? - For me you're as big as you were before. - Really? Yes, but you're a little fatter now. Tell me, what is the progress of your story now? - Story? - Yes. As I told you, that princess had left. But actually, she hadn't gone. She was away for some time. When she came back, Chandan and princess's marriage was arranged. The wedding pavilion was adorned. There was decoration. There was fragrance everywhere. Princess took a platter in hand and left... May God keep you happy, dear. If your mother was here today... Bye, Mr. Kumar. Leela, go. Congratulations on your new life. Let's go, dear. - Are you Leela? - Yes. Tell me. Mr. Shyam has sent a car for you. Has the princess's platter fallen down? Yes. Perhaps that's why she hasn't come. A man thinks about something. But what happens is altogether different. Save me! Leave me! Let me go! Let me go! Save me! Please leave me! Leave me! Leave me! Where have you brought me? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! How can I let you go? Why have you brought me here? I'll not stay here. Let me go! Now you'll have to stay here. For as long as belong to me. You ran away from uncle. You thought you could get away from me? You're wasting your time. I never belonged to you and I never will. If you don't belong to me, I'll not let you belong to anybody else. Either you can belong to me or you go up there to God. Queen! Queen! - Shyam. - Queen, where is Leela? What can I say? I was sending Leela to you... when the goons abducted her. They took her away in a car. Goons took her away in a car? Yes. I made every effort to find her. I informed the police also. But nothing could be done. Shyam, neither you... nor Kumar could get Leela. Kumar couldn't get her! What do you mean? Kumar was also in love with Leela. But when he found out that she loves you... he moved out of your way. Oh! So, this is it. Now I understand your plan. You want to make Leela your daughter-in-law. - That's why you kidnapped her. - Shyam! You call me your son, but it was a treachery. It was a lie. You deceived me. Tell me where Leela is. Where is your son? I'll tell you where my son is. Here is my son. He destroyed himself for your love. And to save Leela. Look at him. This is how I cheated you. The injury to his body is what you call treachery. Please forgive me, queen. The eyes met and then parted ways My happiness is lost The grief of separation is here The eyes met and then parted ways The meeting with my beloved It remained only a dream My happiness is lost The grief of separation is here The eyes met and then parted ways Fate had only a few days of love in store for us The dark night of sorrow is spread My happiness is lost The grief of separation is here The eyes met and then parted ways How are you now? Leela, why do you keep away from me? What crime have I committed? Don't you like my behavior? But what can I do? Since my childhood, everything that I tried to get... I never could. I always had to fight to get what I wanted. I don't know any other way. If you don't know, try to learn it now. There are many things you can't get by fighting. Love is one of them. Leela, you don't know me well. I'm that sea which flows quietly. But when something tries to stop him, it overcomes it. And it destroys everything in its way. You've seen the sea, but not those rocks... which makes the sea change its course. After beating its waves on it, it quietly bypasses it and flows. And doesn't fight anymore. Is that so? Then stay trapped here for life. Now I won't even ask after you. No matter if you die here. His condition is very bad. He can't laugh and can't cry. If he cries, perhaps he'll feel better. But he can't even cry in this grief. You become his support, mother. When a child is in trouble, he looks for help from his mother. Shyam needs a mother. Yes, as long as I'm there, I'll not let him miss a mother. I'll bring him here immediately. Come on. Let's go. Dear Shyam. I'm here to take you along with me. No, Queen. I'll not leave here. I'm totally ruined now. Stupid! You shouldn't behave like this. Life is full of happiness and sorrows. But you shouldn't give up everything because of sorrows. Everybody looks for happiness and pleasure in life, dear. But we don't get it. Life is an agony which never ceases. It's a thorn which never stops pricking you. The life is not a meet, there is always a separation. My partners are not separated, Queen. Everything in this house reminds me of them. If I laugh, they laugh. If I cry, they cry. I can't leave them. If you can't leave them, then I can't leave you here. I'm your adopted mother. Come with me. Come on, dear. Dear Shyam, welcome. Think of this as your own home. I know how you feel in such a situation. But to love and then lose is a lot better than not loving at all. Bhagwan... Yes, Sunder? How long are you going to waste your time on this girl? If not her, there are many others. No, Sunder. I can't think of anybody else except her. You have to make compromises in life, Bhagwan. He, who doesn't do it, ruins himself. Just look at what I've arranged to entertain you. My mad beloved You can't understand what I mean My mad beloved You are mad My darling, go away How can I make you understand? My darling, go away I'm a starlet I'm queen of the stars My youth oozes from my vivacious eyes My darling, but you don't understand my eyes My darling, go away How can I make you understand? This is the meeting of a single night Just see how the butterflies hover over flowers To die while living and to live while dying You don't know about it My darling, go away How can I make you understand? You can't belong to anybody else except me. If you keep yourself away from me, I'll forcibly... - You dare slap me? - Bhagwan, what are you doing? Brother Shyam, what do you keep on thinking... keeping these cups in front of you? Baby, I think that perhaps your friend will come here suddenly... and she'll pick up her cup. I don't know when that day arrive. Excuse me. You're very ill-mannered. It was put here. I wanted it, so I drank it. It doesn't mean than you can take anything you want. This is what I always do. But I'll not let you do this. What's going on here? Don't sigh in love Love is cry of the heart Don't sigh, lock your lips Mister, you seem to be a good person. Won't you help me? You know very well how I'm living here. How I'm slowly withering away. I know it, Miss Leela. I understand your agony. I've thought many times about how to get you released from here. But if I do this, this evil man is capable of doing anything. I'm not worried about my life... but I've small children. I can understand your helplessness. I don't want you to get into trouble after helping me. And your children to lose their shelter. Miss Leela, you may go. No. I'll not do this. I can't leave you to this evil person. Don't worry about it. I'll deal with him. No. He will kill you. My savior is God. You go away from here. Get up. Sunder, take her inside. Hey betrayer! Did I keep you here to allow my prey to run away? Have you forgotten the day when you asked... for a job from me in the name of your children? Yes, Bhagwan. And I've got its fruits. I didn't know that I'd have to do such evil deeds for you. Enough of these sinful deeds. Now our paths are different. Are you leaving me forever? Yes. Okay. I warn you. Get lost. But remember, if you try to deceive me... then I'll destroy your whole family. Go. Let me see how you run away from me. It was my fault that I left you to a foolish man like Babu. Now I'll stay here myself all the time. And I'll see how you dare run away from here. My fate was made after it having been in tatters After being made, again it is in tatters The world of my love is in ruins My hopeful mind had drawn a picture This world has destroyed that picture The fate was made, and now it is in ruins The world of my love is in ruins His love is not in my fate who I'm in love with The flower is away from the bee And the bee is away from the flower The world of my love is in ruins Write a letter in your handwriting. Write it. Dear Shyam, With God's grace, I've run away from the enemy camp. Wait for me in the coffee house at 9 PM day after tomorrow. With best wishes, Forever yours, Leela I've brought it. I've brought the letter of the beloved. Who's it from? Buy my insurance and I'll tell you. - I've brought it. - Is it from Leela? Yes, it's from her. She is coming tonight at 9 PM. But why in the coffee house? Why not here at home? She always used to meet me there. The professor was right. If she's left, she'll return. Dear, you too go, please. Shyam! Why are you here today? Finally the time has come I've been waiting for. - Very good. So Leela is returning? - Yes. Oh, my friend is coming? Yes, your friend is coming. Waiter, two cups of tea. Okay, tell me a story to celebrate this. But this time Chandan and princess should marry. Okay, listen. The princess was lost. Chandan kept looking for her in the jungle. There were wounds to his feet. He lost hope of ever seeing the princess again. Then he saw smoke coming out from a village. The smoke wrote a letter in the sky. Chandan, I'm coming. Shyam! What's the matter? Why are you here? Get out of here. - Otherwise I'll call the police. - Shut up. All of you keep your hands on the tables. Bihari, you come here. You stay where you are. Nobody leave. - What are you doing? - Shyam! Stay where you are. Otherwise I'll shoot you. If you shoot, it will not kill love, my friend. Dear, the night of our meeting is here It is the night of our meeting - What's the matter? - Shut up. You shut up. You come to our place and then dare threaten us? - Move it away. - Shut up. - Baby, you come here. I'll give you five minutes. Speak with each other. Shyam, I'm here to complete that story... which both of you had started together. Not every story is the same. In some, Chandan and the princess can meet. In some stories they don't meet. This is that story where they don't meet. No. This can't be so. - Shyam! - I warn you! Stay where you are. Stay right there. I'm warning you, stay where you are. Otherwise I'll shoot you. Stop, Kumar. Five minutes have passed. Get up! We're separating from each other forever. Please allow us to have our last cups together. Okay! Hands up! Leela! - Leela! - Shyam! - Kumar! - Are you hurt? No. Finally, you've both met. Let's go home. Mother is waiting for you. My daughter has come! Don't ask how we brought Leela here, Queen. The goons tried to fight. But finally they were caught. That's good. Son! What happened? Nothing, mother. You had said that this painting lacks one color. Today I've put the missing color. My son! You're hurt again. This injury will also heal, mother.
