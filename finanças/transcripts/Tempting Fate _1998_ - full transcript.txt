(MultiCom Jingle) (upbeat music) - [Tom] From Los Angeles, it's Tom Leykis Show at 1-800-5800-TOM, that's our telephone number. Do you hate L.A.? I mean, does L.A. suck? - Move! Let's move it. - [Tom] Bert is on a payphone in Long Beach. Bert, you're on the Tom Leykis Show, hello. - [Bert] Hello, Tom. - [Tom] Hello, Bert. - Come on. - How you feel? - Pretty good, how 'bout you? - Just. - I hate the L.A. drivers on the freeway. - Hello. - Driving around talking on the car phone, doing their makeup. - Here we go. - They didn't see. - Hey, what's up? - [Lorenzo] Dr. Creed. - Yeah. - Your patient, Mr. Weber is slipping. - Um. - Dr. Lerner is here, but he won't operate without you. - Could you let me in? - [Lorenzo] Dr. Creed? - [Ben] Could you let? Yeah? - He's uncomfortable performing your own procedure. - Right. - And he doesn't want to get sued. - Oh, great, well, that's sweet of him. - [Bert] Yeah, but isn't it dangerous? - All right, look, I'll be right there. Could you let me in? Excuse me, Miss, could you just let me in. - Dr. Creed. - Thank you. - [Lorenzo] Well, hurry up. The patient is going. - Finally, someone let me in. - Hurry up. - I'll be right there, I'm flying in as fast as I can. - [Tom] Here is Lily. Lily, you're on the Tom Leykis Show. Lily, does L.A. suck? I mean, do you hate your life? - [Lily] Yeah, things have gotten so bad that I'm moving to another country. - [Tom] No! - [Lily] Yeah, seriously. - [Tom] Really? - [Lily] Uh huh, in April. - [Tom] Why? - [Lily] Well because, because I am just sick of it. - Excuse me, that's my spot! - I've lived here for four years, and it is awful. Between the traffic - Hey! - [Lily] and the fighting and the gangs, and ugh. I'll tell ya something, I am fed up. I am just tired of it. Every day, I dread getting up in the morning and dealing with everybody here. - [Tom] So, where are you gonna go? - [Lily] Lebanon. - [Tom] And Lebanon is an improvement over Los Angeles? - [Lily] Yeah, I think it's a little-- (Lily drowned out by tense music) - Listen, uh, guys. Oh man. (people yelling) - Gordy in Los Angeles, you're on 97.1, the FM talk station. - [Man] Hey, wait a minute! - Where you going, buddy? - Tom. - L.A. - Can I have someone take a look at that? - That trap, that trap. As soon as I can, I'm taking my kids and gettin' out. It sure can't be hard to find a better place. I mean, you know, I can get a cabin out in the woods some place better off than here. It's hard. - [Ben] Lorenzo? - Sorry about your patient, couldn't hold on. We lost him. (somber music) (Ben sighs) - Not only are you the best we have, but you're the best in the city and the state. So, when your patient dies on the table while you're out riding around in your sports car, I have to ask myself, what's going on with you? Are you listening, Ben? - You're right, I'm sorry, there's, there's no excuse. (siren wailing) - Yeah, well, it happens. There is nobody better than you, Ben. Lerner is senior, but he's a putz. So, you are definitely in line. I'd say five years, in five years, you could be chief of neurosurgery-- - Could I have this? - You don't seem to understand the importance of what I'm saying to you. You could be chief in your 40s, Ben, chief! What the hell more could you want? (somber music) - [Melody] James. Come here. (Melody laughing) Slowly. Want some more, thirsty? Oh, look. (playful jingling) Look. Good. What'd ya find there? Whatcha got? - No, no offense, but this lab is a joke. I don't even know why I bother. - Don't go, look, I made a breakthrough. - Uh huh, another one. - Just let me show it to you. - No, not interested. - Look, you want me to say it, I'll say it. I need a scientist of your caliber to verify my results, okay? - No, forget it, Emmett. You know, the review board's already written me off because of you. - Oh, you're gonna blame me because you didn't get your grant? - Yeah, I can and I do. Lach, you are an embarrassment to this field, and let me make it very clear, we're not associated. - You'll be sorry. (machine whirring) I set the generator to 7.6 cycles. This is the highest surge level to date. If it doesn't turn me into electromagnetic dust, I should be able to access the negative space between subatomic particles. Master key inserted. Pulse indicator board on. Pulse generators on. Gate linear is on. If my theory is correct, negative space between these particles, there exists a window, (sighs) a window do another universe. This is it. Counting down now. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, flashlight, three, two, one. (electrical whirring) (gentle music) Oh my god, I've done it. I'm across. (Emmett panting) Ah. (gentle music) (bike bell rings) (Emmett sighs) Wow. (upbeat music) - You know what the worst part about being dentist is, Tobes? - What's that? - Well yes, you get to cause people great amounts of pain, and I can say anything I want, but there's no dialogue. - [Toby] Uh huh. - I want your life, Toby. Your own place, no root canals. - Maybe from where you're sittin', big guy. - [Ben] Hi John. - Hey, you're late. - Sorry, Toby, can you start me with a chicken sandwich please. - Mm. - Comin' right up. - Emmett's not coming. He wants us to come to the lab and see some science thing. - I don't, I don't have the life that I want. - Would you, would you know it if you did? - Yeah, I would, I would have her. - Oh, are we talking about Melody Youngman? - She was the one, she, she, you know. I never shoulda let her go. - You weren't ready for marriage. You wanted success. Why don't you save yourself some time. Go find Melody and ask her, would you like some alimony and half a house? - I found Melody. She's married, has kids, lives in Culver City, and she's very happy. (gentle music) - Well, I hate to make you feel bad, but she's even more beautiful than she used to be. - Watch this, watch. - [John] Man, this is unhealthy, you're obsessed. - I know, I know, I can't help it. I'm just, I, I just feel like she represents everything I should have done with my life. - Well, do it now. - No, it's too late. - Oh, come on, have an adventure, have an affair. - I don't want an affair. I want, I want a connection. I want something warm at the center of my life, a woman, a child. I want Melody Youngman. (sighs) I feel like I lost that chance, you know? I actually told her, I said, oh no, I can't, I can't be in this relationship. I have to, you know, be free for my work. I have to be successful first. - Okay, so you're miserable. At least you're rich and miserable. (John chuckles) - 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. (electrical whirring) (machine sputtering) Wait, it'll work. (Ben and John groaning) - (sighs) Hey man, can you take Genghis for the night? - In another minute, these books are gonna be in a parallel universe. - Emmett, eat this, your blood sugar is low. - [John] Look man, can you take the dog, yes or no? - Yes, it's gonna work. - We gotta go, we'll see ya later. We'll see ya tomorrow. - Okay, see ya. - Be good, Genghis, be good. (Genghis whimpers) (machine beeping) (electrical whirring) (tense music) (gentle music) (Genghis barks) - Aw, Genghis, thank god. I thought I lost you, buddy. Hey, how'd that feel? Pretty weird, huh? Hey, we're here, wanna go for a walk? (Genghis barks) Yeah, come on. (gentle music) (Genghis barks) - [Man] Okay, bye. - [Man] All right, take care. - See Genghis, very similar to our world. Of course, we won't know how similar until we explore. Come on, let's go. Everybody seems very friendly. The cars all seem to be white. People get out of them and somebody else gets in. I'm gonna try to find the date. Oh, hi. Uh, I was just trying to figure out what to. - Oh, it's free, buddy. - Oh, hey. - There ya go. - Ah, thanks. - No problem. - Thanks. (tense music) - Now, you're dog's not on a leash. (Genghis whimpers) - Oh, yes, uh, I know. (coughs) You see-- - Hey. I've got one. (chuckles) Thanks. - You're welcome. - Stay even. - Stay even. It's the same date. (dog barking) (gentle music) (Genghis whimpers) Genghis! - You think Emmett's losing it? - You mean, as opposed to us? (upbeat music) We're outta here. (John groaning) - [John] Hey, hey man, slow down. - [Ben] Why? - Slow down. Where are you going, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Ben, Ben, this is dangerous. - You're the one who was talking about suicide, woo! - Yeah, I didn't think you'd. - Whoa oh! - Oh sure, sure, this is what I wanted. I know, but I didn't want it to hurt. This is nuts. Slow down, Ben! (siren wails) (muffled speaking on radio) (Ben sighs) (Ben groans) - License and registration please. - [Ben] Here it is, officer. - You were driving with your hands off the wheel, you know? - Yeah, I was, uh, stupid. It won't happen again. - Do you believe him. - No, I do not. - (sighs) Do you know what we're gonna do, Doc? - Oh what, the Rodney King thing. - Oh, and he's a smart ass too. - We're gonna be watching you. - Both of you. - [Officer] There you go, chubby. (muffled speaking on radio) - [Ben] Longterm memory systems. Every joke this man has ever heard right here. (upbeat music) Suction. And what's the pressure on this guy? - [Lorenzo] Fine - [Ben] Oh, I need the numbers. - [Lorenzo] 120. - [Ben] Where's squeegee, squeegee. - [Woman] Squeegee. - [Ben] Okay, irrigation. Will you be faster on the irrigation please? - [Woman] Sorry, Doctor. - [Lorenzo] Pressure's steady. - [Ben] While I'm here, I should probably just erase him his memory tapes, you know, nothing important, just the Barry Manilow tapes. Okay, suction again, more suction. Give me 45 hook please. - [Woman] 45 hook. - [Ben] Irrigation, more irrigation. A little faster on the irrigation please. Suction, come on, you have to anticipate this. You guys have Valium with your pancakes this morning? I mean, what's the deal? Uh, micro forceps, take the hook, take the hook, and then, now the, thank you. All right, this is the part where you hold the retractor. Let me see your hands. I don't see your hands. - [Lorenzo] Doctor. - What, I'm a little busy right now. - [Lorenzo] You're too fast for us. - [Ben] I can't be too fast. I cannot be too fast, I am a clock. I set the pace, and I am the clock, all right? (phone ringing) (Ben sighs) - [Announcer] Dr. Brook, Dr. Allison Brook, extension 291. Dr. Brook, Dr. Allison Brook, 291 please. (Ben sighs) - What was going on in there? - Brain surgery. - You were moving too fast. (Ben sighs) - That's what this world is all about. - I'm transferring off your team. - Lorenzo, please. - You're going to kill somebody. - I just, I just saved somebody's life. - You're going to kill you, and I don't wanna watch it. (sullen music) - Lorenzo. (Ben groans) Lorenzo! - [John] I can't believe you lost my dog. Where is he? - He's gone, but I know where he is. Let me show you. - [Ben] Emmett, how long have you been awake? - Just listen to me. Genghis is another world, but it's a friendly world, and it's kinda like this one, only cleaner, and people are kinder, and automobile, automobiles are common property, I think. And we're there too, I mean, different versions of ourselves. It's not exactly the same. It's like a mirror of this world. - What, what is he talking about? - [Ben] I have no idea. (machines beeping) (tense music) - Genius. Watch, two, one. (electrical whirring) (gentle music) - Oh. (John gasps) (electrical whirring) (Ben chuckling) - Is it some kind of an illusion? - Ha, did you have, what is it, a hologram or something like that? - No, no, I told you, a parallel universe. - Where were you? - Here, I was right here. In the space between. - Between what? - Between the protons and the neutrons, there's a whole universe of space between them. Universes, galaxies, look. Imagine, imagine that every time you made a crucial decision that a whole new world containing the opposite choice was created. Well, it actually exists. (Ben sighs happily) - That's impossible, isn't it? - No, no, no, they're actually working on it at MIT, Caltech, Tokyo, London, I mean, they're all right behind me, but I'm the one, I'm the one who found the window. And I need your help, I need your help to explore it. - Why don't you go? - I've been several times, but I'm afraid to go to far from the reentry equipment. I need to monitor it and maintain it to ensure the safe return of my explorers. - Does it pay? - Ben, please. - Mm-mm. - Yes! - Wait, wait, are you nuts? This this is-- - I got nothin' to lose, John. - Okay, one hour. I want you to explore for one hour and then return. - Okay, you said that there might be like a version of myself living my life. I wanna see that. - No, not yet. You have to stay within a six block area. Don't take any chances and don't be seen. Okay? - Okay, okay. - You, you, you guys are both insane. - I'll find Genghis, John, come on. - 10, nine, eight, seven, I've tested it, Ben, it's safe. Four, three, two, record it. (electrical whirring) (gentle music) (electrical whirring) (John panting) - Am I all here? - Yeah, you're all here. I guess I'm not the only one who's insane. - Well, insanity loves company. (peaceful music) (pedestrians chattering) - [Construction Worker] Hey, look at this. We need to move the scaffolding. - Whoa. The cars, common property. - Nice touch. - Really. - God, it's so much like. Hey, you know, people are lookin' at me like I'm some kinda (sighs). What's your problem, man? - [Ben] John, hey, don't. - Bet they don't even know what the finger means. - Maybe they know the parallel you and they think you're him or something. - What are you doing? - I wanna see me. - What? (laughs) We only have an hour, we have to be back-- - I'll be back. (Ben sighs) Check it out, no key. Ha! (engine whirring) This is great. - Emmett said, no contact. - No, I just, I just wanna see him. I wanna see if he's happy. (gentle music) Pretty amazing, huh? - Hey, 55 minutes! - It's cleaner, it's definitely cleaner here. It smells good, yeah. And there's no traffic, no traffic whatsoever, I love it. - [Announcer] Attention, an emotions control seminar will begin in one hour. All altered servants are required to attend prior to. (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Ben] Dr. Creed, neurosurgery, please. - Creed? - Benjamin Creed. - Oh, well, were you a patient or? - Uh, no, no, I'm an old, old friend. - Oh, well, I'm sorry to tell you this, but Dr. Creed is no longer with us. - Where is he? - I mean, he's, he died in the war, the Desert War. It's been almost three years. - Oh, uh, I, I didn't. - It was a real tragedy, a real loss to all of us. And to his family, of course. - His family? - [Lorenzo] Yes, his widow. - He was married? - [Lorenzo] Yes, for some years. - Um, could you, uh, could you tell me where his widow lives? (gentle music) - [John] Everybody's smiling, willing to help. - The history's a little different. They had a war there, like the Gulf War, but it was bigger and it was in Libya. - I actually saw myself. I just turned the corner and there he was. - I was in it, I volunteered as a physician in that war. - Did he see you? - [John] Yes. - But I was killed in the war. - [Emmett] What did you say to yourself? - Nothing, he didn't recognize me. - Well, how could he not recognize you? What do you mean? - 'Cause he's thin. He's so thin, he's like Gandhi thin. He's a thin, successful dentist. He just passed right by me. - She's my wife, my widow. - [Emmett And John] Who? - Melody Youngman. (gentle music) (Emmett sighs) - All right, look. Let me get organized and I'll send you again for six hours, okay? - Look at this, look at this. He's still alive. - Wow! (Ben chuckling) It's time for a change. - Where you goin'? - Uh, not far. - You movin' to the country? - Nope. - Well, that's good, Doc. Personally, I don't go along with this everybody leavin' the city. Where you live is like a marriage. Everybody's divorcing L.A. I figure, people should just stay put and work it out. - Well, here's to changin' the world. - You gotta start somewhere. - [John] Hey, Ben! - [Ben] Hey, I gotta talk to you. - I'm excited, are you excited? - Listen, John, I'm stayin' there. I'm not comin' back. - Did you tell Emmett? - No because I'm afraid if I tell him, he won't let me cross over. John, (sighs) she's my widow. I can walk right back into her life, her long lost husband. I can start living the life that I should've been living. It's my chance. - I sold everything. I'm not comin' back either. No debts, no obligations. It's a blank page for me, man. I mean, it's fate, right? Good. (John laughing) - Opa! - [Everyone] Opa! (machines beeping) - Okay. Six hours from now. Synchronize your watches. - Come on, let's go. - How 'bout you, Emmett? You found your other self there? - Yeah, I checked up on him. He's still in Buffalo, never got the UCLA grant. Something of a misfit, as I understand. Disappeared about a year ago. - Any other differences we should know about? - Uh, yeah, there's an extra card in the deck. Remember that. - Playing cards? - Yeah, there's 53 in the deck. - Okay, so we won't play poker, come on. Let's go. - Okay, 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, remember, six hours, three, two, one. (electrical whirring) (gentle music) (electrical whirring) What? - [Ben] Emmett, we won't be back in six hours. Don't be mad. - They're staying? - [Ben] We're staying. Don't try to find us. We need this. To you, this is an experiment. - No, no, no, no. - [Ben] To us, it's a second chance. - Yes, can I help you? - Yes, John Bollandine, CIA. Don't bother to call them. They'll tell you that they've never heard of me. In fact, you've never even seen me. Do I make myself clear? - Sure. - It's better that we discuss this alone. Libya, 1995, the war. Dr. Benjamin Creed was listed as being killed in action. - Yes, it's a tragedy. - We now know that the wrong body was sent home. - I don't understand, he's still missing, huh? - [John] No, not anymore, he's here. - Ben is alive? - The last three years of his life are unaccounted for. We believe that he was imprisoned, probably tortured. Really, he's a hero. Although, he can't tell us exactly where he's been. - He doesn't know? - Amnesia, he was found in the desert. He still has a few gaps in his memory, but he's in good health and ready to step back into his life. - This is unbelievable! - Yes, well, it would be, except. (gentle music) (Dan laughing) - Ben! Ben! My god, Ben! - [Ben] You were fantastic. - [John] No, no, no. - You were great. You were, you were great. - Okay, I was, I was. - Well, don't get too pigheaded. (tense music) It's them. - What are they doing here. Are they still staring? Don't look. - Relax, relax, maybe it's two other cops. - No, no, it's them. - They could be their two, you know, parallel selves. They could be cops here too. - Why would they be staring at us? (siren wails) - The light's green, sir. - Oh, thank you. - Okay. (doorbell ringing) Mrs. Creed. - [Melody] Yes? - There was a mix-up in Tunisia. The body that was sent home was not your husband's. (sullen music) (Ben sighs) - [Melody] Ben! Ben. - [Ben] Melody, oh! - Oh my god, Ben. It's been three years. - Oh, I know, I know, it feels like forever since I held you. Oh god, you're even more beautiful now. - Are you really here? - Yeah, yeah, I'm home. Do, do you need some help in there? - [Melody] No, thanks. Do you want some tea? - Yeah, sure. 11 of spades? - Ben, does that CIA man know what happened to you? - Uh, no, not really. - Why is he so fat? (Ben sighs) (Ben chuckles) Here. (peaceful music) So, when do you start at the hospital? - Not until Monday, and then just part time at first. I told them, I told them, I said, I want time with my wife. No more around the clock schedule, no more. - No more what? - You know, I, I'm sure that, you know, you need time for this to sink in. Probably seeing other men and. - Oh, that's over now. - Well, I, I understand if, if you, um, you know, need more time before. - Oh, do you wanna make love? - Well. Yeah. - Okay. Come on. - Really? (Ben sighs) I feel like my life is just beginning. (Ben moans) (Ben sighs) (tense music) (Melody humming) (Ben sighs) (Melody giggling) I love you so much. Do you have any idea how much I love you? - [Melody] No. - You don't? - No. - You don't? - No. - [Ben] I can't believe you don't know how much I love you. - Oh Ben. - What? - Here on the floor? - Yeah, right here on the floor. (phone ringing) What? What are you doin'? Don't answer it. - Hello? It's the hospital. - Tell them that we're busy. - [Melody] Ben. (Ben sighs) - [Dan] Ben, you've done hundreds of these procedures before. - [Ben] I, I still have some gaps, would you mind filling me in? - [Dan] You make a two-centimeter cut here, and why don't you observe this time? It's a standard alteration. The patient is out of pattern. - [Ben] Pardon? - [Lorenzo] He's cuckoo. - [Ben] Oh! Why'd you start the flap up there? - [Dan] To give you room so that you could make-- - [Ben] I only need half that room. Do you mind if I do this, Dan? - [Dan] Well, I, I was, hey, sure, go ahead. - [Announcer] Delivery nurse to discharge. - Woo! - [Announcer] Delivery nurse to discharge, please. - Excellent job, Ben. - It was a little quiet in there, you know? I mean, you guys ever, you ever listen to music or anything like that? No? I'm gonna bring a boombox in tomorrow. We can get down to something really. Anybody know any jokes at all? Come on, people, lighten up, it's not like it's brain surgery. (Dan chuckles) (Dan laughing) (Lorenzo laughing) (everyone laughing) There we go, yeah. (people chattering) - [John] God, this is perfect. It's a dream come true. - [Toby] I called your reference at the hospital, Dr. Creed. Says you're an A-one guy. - Oh, I am, I am. (John sighs) Hi, everyone, hi, next round's on me! (everyone cheering) Opa! (tense music) - [Announcer] Dr. Lauren to sanguine therapy. Dr. Lauren to sanguine therapy. - This is Mr. Dalton. He's another alteration for you. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. How many candidates are there for this procedure? Is everybody going nuts? - There's a backlog, Doctor. We have to press on. - Time out. Do not prep this patient. I'm to tired, Lorenzo, I'm goin' home. Tomorrow, I wanna see this guy's file. What kinda psychosis? What are his symptoms, what are the alternatives? These doors are locked. - Of course, they are. - What's that? - You said you were tired. Want one? - Want one what? (electrical whirring) Ooh! - You really don't remember, do you, Dr. Creed? (Ben groans) Feeling more awake now? (Ben sighs) - Yeah. I'm not some production line hack. I haven't seen a tumor since I've been back here. - All right, we'll get you a tumor tomorrow, Ben. But the alteration is a very important tool against mental illness. - Yeah-- - We all perform this procedure. - Five times a week? I mean, what are we, lobotomies-r-us? - No, no, this is nothing like the old-fashioned lobotomies. It's very focused and, ah, damn it, Ben. Your gaps can be very irritating, I. I'm sorry, it's not your fault. We probably rushed you back to work too soon. You need a little more time. Why don't you, um, go home, get some rest? Stay even, Ben. - Oh look, Ben, today's the 11th. Are you gonna play? - [Ben] Huh? - The Game. - Oh yeah, sure, what game? - [Melody] Our district's at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. - Melody. (Ben sighs) What do you say, let's get outta town, you know? And just leave the city, you know, drive up the coast or somethin'? - Ben. We don't have a relocation permit. You know that. It's gonna take a at least a year to prove that you're stable. - Stable? - Your memory gaps. - A year, you said, a year? - Well, yeah, but, what's the matter? Don't you like our home? - Yeah, I. (doorbell ringing) I'll get it. (tense music) What are you doin' here? - What am I doing here? You were supposed to be helping me. - How'd you find us? - We have to go, we have to find John and we have to go now. - [Melody] Who is it, honey? - Uh, it's, it's just a old friend, sweetheart. - What are you doing, Ben? You don't belong here. You're an alien here. - Would you just leave us alone? - You're my proof! You're my field team. Without you, my work is worthless, my life's work. I thought you were my friend, Ben. - I am your friend, but I'm living my life. Emmett, I am finally living my life. - They're gonna demolish the building where the reentry pad is. You can come back. Just come and help me with the equipment because. - Hi. Can your friend come in for a cup of tea? (Ben sighs) - Melody, I gotta go right now, but I'll be back. - Come on, Ben, let's go. We gotta go. We have to go find John, come on. - Okay everybody, charge is set, come on. - Push that thing. - Let's go! - [Construction Worker] Let's do it! - [Construction Worker] Get your line. - We gotta hurry. - [Construction Worker] Hey, get those people back. - [Construction Worker] Hey, I got the ball. - Wait, no! I gotta get back there. - Hey, man-- - Just for a second. I need to get back there! Two minutes, I gotta get back there! - Wait, Emmett! - Emmett! - [John] Emmett, stop! - Emmett! - [John] Come back! - I gotta get in there! - [John] Can't you stop it? - [Construction Worker] No, listen, there's no stopping it. - Emmett! (construction workers yelling) - Emmett! Stop! - [Ben] Wait! (alarm buzzing) - [Construction Worker] Get down! (electrical whirring) (Emmett screaming) (men coughing) (gentle music) - [Ben] Emmett. - [Paramedic] Watch your step. (sullen music) - [Officer] One Adam 25 responding, ETA two minutes. - Well, look who's here. (siren wailing) - It's all our fault. - We shoulda listened to him. - It's what we wanted, right? We're here to stay, John. We're here to stay. - [Announcer] Welcome to the Grand Olympic Auditorium. Please be sure you haven't left any personal items in your city vehicle and proceed inside to line up and register for the Game. - [Ben] I can't do this, I mean. (sighs) - [John] Well, we got to. - [Ben] What are doin' here? - [John] They're watching us, we gotta blend in. - [Announcer] Tear off the lower voucher and hand it to the attendant who will supply you with your slip. Once all sectors have signed in. - Over there. - We will announce the candidates. The Game is about to begin. Please take your assigned seats. The Westport Amphitheater is all signed in.

Some people don't seem to like me. - All signed in. - You? - Maybe I shoulda brought a glove. - [Announcer] Welcome to the Game. - Why don't they like you. - [Announcer] The Western Arena had the high school last month. - But I'll tell ya, it's weight, man. I mean, look around you. No one here is overweight, not one. I mean, look. - The Game. (tense music) Find your district table. - Oh my god, it's them. - And sign in. Tear off the lower voucher. - It's probably just a coincidence. Everybody shows up at this. - No, they were watching me at the bar, they're. - [Announcer] We will announce the candidates. The Game is about to begin. Please take your assigned seats. - They're gone. - And good luck. We are now ready to play the Game. All sectors have signed in. (exciting music) (crowd cheering) Ladies and gentlemen, for those of you at home, please turn your televisions to channel one. Are the players ready? (crowd cheering) I can't hear you, sector four. Are the players ready? (crowd cheering) - Well, we can't all be up to bat. - Announcing the three official candidates for the Los Angeles Game. First, Jeffrey Addison, 444 Kinzey Court. He was reported three blocks south of Figueroa, just east of the Harbor Freeway. - You don't suppose they're? - The second candidate is William Braverman, 112 Waterton Avenue. - Run, William, run! - Apartment 7A. That's between Berendo and Third in Koreatown. Be sure to keep track of your equipment and your enrollment voucher. And drive safely.

(crowd screaming) (William panting) - [John] Take it easy, man! Hey! (Ben groans) (William panting) Stop! (helicopter whirring) (crowd chanting) (somber music) (William whimpering) (crowd screaming) (William crying) (sullen music) (Ben sighs) - Hey. - [Ben] Hey. - Was it fun? (Ben sighs) - They play this Game all over the country? - Oh, Ben. You forgot again. You have to let me help you remember things. - The 11th of every month, they? - Mm-hmm. Most parts of the world. Did you enjoy it? (Ben sighs) - No. I didn't. - Well, just don't tell anyone, okay? - Here you go. (John sighs) Best beer in the world, generic. (John sighs) No, put your money away, it's on the house. Hey, Officer, welcome. Pull up a stool, can I. Is there some kind of problem, officers? - We've been watching you. - I know, I know, why? - Well, you're not gettin' any thinner, Mr. Bollandine. - So what? My body is my temple, right? - You're way outta pattern, mister. - What? - Come on, let's go. - Wait a minute. - Let's go. - Hey. Look, where are we going? Look, I get a phone call, right? What, what are the charges? It can't be the weight. - Gross obesity in a public place. - Oh, come on. Well, what'll happen to me? - Well, they'll fix ya, I suppose. - Fix? - Yeah, (mimics scissors snipping). - Wait, wait, wait. - Come on. - No, no. Look, look, I'll go on a diet, okay? I'll, I'll fast. - Come on, chubby. (John grunts) (tense music) (John groaning) - No sweat, no sweat, I'll call it in. - Grab him. - Okay. (John panting) (car horns honking) - All right, freeze, chubby. (dog barks) - Genghis? (Genghis barking) Kick the ass! Yes! Yeah, get him! Get him, get him! Genghis, come here, buddy. (John whistles) Come here, you blessed, blessed beast. Oh, you're my canine, you. - There you go. (doorbell rings) - I'll get it. (coughs) John! - Hey. - What's the matter? - Ah, I'm in trouble, man. - [Ben] Hey, Genghis! You found Genghis? - Ben, Ben, we, we don't have a permit for a dog inside the house. - Melody. (sighs) Just take Genghis into the kitchen, okay? Come on, come on, Genghis. Just give him something to eat, yeah? Come on, Genghis, good boy. - [Melody] Ah. - What's goin' on? - They tried to arrest me, man. For the weight. - What? - For the weight. They wanna cut my brain. - Well, uh, we'll get outta town when it's dark. Maybe no one will bother us there. - Hey, that's great, huh? I found Genghis. - Yeah, yeah, I know, it's really great. I'm gonna tell Melody to pack. - [John] Okay. - I heard what he said, Ben. He shouldn't have come here. - [Ben] We have to pack. - I don't think you should be here when they come. - Who? - The police. (Ben sighs) - Melody, the police are not gonna come. He's my friend. - Ben. I already called them. (tense music) He's very dangerous to us. (tires screeching) - John! - [Officer] There he is! - Hey, hey! (John grunting) John, run for it! - [Officer] Get his hands! - Run for it! (John groaning) - [Ben] Get off of me! - You're gonna be okay. - John! - [John] Okay. - John! You'll be all right. It's okay. - No. - [Officer] Come on. - All right, all right, I'm fine, I'm fine. Just get off of me, I'm even. (Ben pants) (muffled speaking on radio) - [John] Hey, easy. Hey, watch the head, watch the head! (siren wailing) - He was my best friend. He was my best friend! (Ben panting) (sullen music) (Ben gasping) - They told me you were dead. I couldn't stop crying. I couldn't eat and I couldn't sleep, and then they took me into the hospital, and I felt so much better after. - Okay. - So much better. - It's okay, it's okay, I'm sorry. (Ben sighs) I'm sorry. It's okay. It's gonna be all right. - [Announcer] Dr. Holland, Dr. Steven Holland, please report to OR three. You have a backlog of procedure. - [Staff] How we doin', all right, here? - [Nurse] Doctor? - [Lorenzo] How you doin'? Feeling better? - All these are candidates for, for alteration? - Yes, some are scheduled for you today, Doctor. - Where, where, where's list of symptoms? - Constantly questions authority. - Hi. (Ben sighs) You a little, a little scared today? Mm. - [Staff] Well, they need another procedure done. - [Staff] Ma'am, have they ordered a full workup? - I just don't wanna go, please! - PTT also. - [Staff] All right, calm down. - [Ellen] Where are you taking me? Where are you taking me? - Calm down. - No! - Relax. - No! - [Staff] This is all right. - I am not insane! You're the crazy bastards! Why don't you people believe me? What the hell are you lookin' at? No! No! - She just gave me the finger. - [Announcer] Tally assess report. - They don't know what that means here. The, uh, patient in room 515. - Yes? - Where's her file? - Oh, they've taken her file. I think Dr. Bardwell has it, a very weird case. - Yeah? - Deep psychosis with hallucinations. - Here's the Mason boy. He's ready to be released. - Released? I didn't think he was done yet. - Well, if it says he's cured, he's cured. - Yes, Doctor. - Now, about 515. - Uh, she gives her name as Ellen Moretti from Caltech, and there is an Ellen Moretti there, we talked to her. This patient believes she's Ellen Moretti, but she says she-- (phone ringing) Oh. Five West. - She says what? She says what? - She, uh, says she's from another world. (suspenseful music) - [Ben] She's gone. (phone ringing) - [Woman] Oh, thank you. - Ellen Moretti? You've been released? - Do I know you? - You gave me the finger back there, remember? - Pardon me? - Nobody does that here. - Does what? - How did you get here? - What do you mean, how did I get here? I'm from Caltech. I'm supposed to meet a Dr. Bardwell. There's a woman here claiming to be me. Excuse me. - Don't I get a trial? - You're wearing your guilt, Mr. Bollandine. - But, whoa, but are they gonna cut my brain? - We're not sure that would be effective in your case. - How's it goin', Mr. Bollandine? - We could try. - What's, what's the alternative? - Isolation. When there's a deviation that can't be altered surgically, we put you away. - Well, then, then I, I choose isolation. - Are you sure? Is it is utter isolation. - Well, that's definitely my vote. - Very well. - Name. - Ellen Moretti. (electrical buzzing) (Ellen groaning) - Name? Name? (Ellen sighs) - You should answer, Miss because the treatment will also activate on silence. Okay? - [Ellen] My name is Ellen Ping Moretti. (electrical buzzing) (Ellen groaning) - [Interviewer] Where were you born? - Chicago. - [Interviewer] And where do you live now? - [Ellen] Pasadena. - [Interviewer] And where do you work? - At the California Institute-- - Excuse me. - Of Technology. - Ben? - You can't go in there. - I'm sorry, but this involves government security. - I'll vouch for Dr. Creed. Ben, I can use your help on this one. - My god, who are you? - Ellen? Please, make them stop. - Do you have her chart? Let, let me see the data on this? What have you been doing to her? - Electroshock, but she's not responding. - Strange case. Your twin, I suppose. - I have no twin. - None that you are aware of. - No, Ellen, Ellen, you are my counterpart here. - Who are you? - Please, listen. You're a scientist. - Yes. - Particle physics. - [Ellen] Yes. - You work with Dr. Kline and Dr. Yang. - Yes. - For the last 10 months, you've been exploring the theory that within the inner space of each atom, between the particles, there could be the chance that whole other universes exist, invisible to our own, right? Tell them! - (sighs) She's insane. - What? No! - We are working on light waves. Who is she? - No one in your field is examining this possibility? - It's science fiction. - No, it is not science-- (electrical buzzing) (Ellen groaning) - [Ben] What are you doing? You're never gonna find out anything from her this way. - Ben! Wait. - Well, there's a possibility that she may be right. - Look, she is not Ellen Moretti, I am. And none of the scientists I know are wasting their time looking for a parallel universe. - Well, that's too bad, isn't it? - Will you ask your parents about the lost twin possibility? - (sighs) I have no twin! And I don't want anyone thinking that there's insanity in my family. This has nothing to do with me, nothing! - You okay? - Satisfied? - I don't see any security risk. Just another psychotic. - Yes, we'll operate tomorrow. - I'll, uh, I'll do this one. - Uh, this is not a simple alteration, Ben. Do you remember the Thurston procedure? - Sure. Of course, I do. - Wait, what are you talkin' about? - [Dan] Nurse. - Huh? No, please. - Would you take her back to her room, please? - [Ellen] No, no, no! Please! - [Nurse] You'll be all right, just relax. - I'll be alone with her for a little while. - You know the rules, Doctor. - Oh, uh, oh yeah. I forgot. (Ellen sobbing) Ellen. - What is it, what are you gonna do? Lobotomy? - Well, a form of one, yeah. - No, no, don't, don't take my mind! Please! - Ellen. - Lock me up. You're a doctor, life is precious. Leave me my mind! - Ellen, Ellen. Ellen, Ellen, we're from the same place. (Ellen panting) - Chicago? (tense music) - Isn't it nice when you're traveling and meet somebody from home? - You came here from? - That's right, same place as you. (Ellen sighs) Sometimes, feels like a whole universe away. (gentle music) Hey, sweetheart. - Hi. - What are you doin'? What are you doin'? Hey. - [Melody] Ben, please don't, don't. - What are you doing? - Lovey. - This is from John. - Ben, you really shouldn't communicate with that man. It's, it's dangerous for us. - [Ben] Melody. (sullen music) - [John] Hey buddy, don't worry about me. They gave me a choice, have my brain cut or live in seclusion in the beautiful sierras surrounded by pine trees and wild flowers and deer and birds and butterflies. (laughs) No kidding, they call this punishment. (sighs) Hell, maybe I'll write a book. Hell, maybe I'll even read one. They told me they'll resupply the food once a month, but I suppose there's not pizza delivery. Maybe I will lose weight. And by the way, I only get to write one letter and this is it. I'm not allowed to get mail. So, this is the big goodbye. Take care of Genghis and watch your weight. I love you, buddy, and here's to home. Maybe it wasn't so bad. John. - Ben. Please. Please. (Ben sighs) - One butter knife, that's it? No paper, not even a pen. (dramatic music) (John groans) Ah, stupid, ah! (suspenseful music) - [Announcer] Wells, if you have a coordinator, please report to Wells. - Have they prepped the Moretti woman? - Having trouble restraining her, I hear. - I'll, uh, I'll check it out. - [Announcer] Dr. Ivonne State. (Ellen groaning) - What's goin' on here? She's supposed to be in surgery right now! - She's almost ready, Doctor. - Well, she's almost ready. Now, well, that's doesn't quite cut it with me. - [Nurse] She's shaved, and I'm just gonna put her out now. - No, you know what, I'll do it. I'm fine, I'll just do it myself. I'm sure you can find some work in some other prep room. Would you close the door please? (Ellen moaning) Get me Nurse Lorenzo. No, I mean, physically, walk out the door, find Lorenzo, and bring her here! And close the door behind you. - Ow! - I shot you full of vitamins. You're not gonna go to sleep. (Ellen panting) - Who are you? - Have you heard a physicist by the name of Emmett Lach? - Oh my god, Lach? Yeah, our work overlapped, but he couldn't have figured out-- - Three of us crossed over. Emmett is dead. His reentry equipment is gone. My friend John's been arrested. And that leaves me and you. Where's your reentry? (Ellen groans) Look, I'm trapped too. We don't belong here. And I wanna go home. - It's in a lab at Caltech. (Ben sighs) - They're gonna put you in a recovery room. Just pretend that you're asleep. - What, wait, what are you gonna do? - I have to make an incision and sew it up. - A what? - It has to look real. - [Ellen] Real? - You want me to put you out? - No, no. - Listen carefully, in about an hour, it's gonna get dark. There are some clothes in the closet of the recovery room with release papers in 'em. Just walk out the door and act real mild. Can you do that? - Yeah, sure. Could you please tell me your name? - Ben Creed. Are you a good surgeon, Ben? - Aw, I'm outta this world. Now look, I've numbed this area somewhat, but it's still gonna hurt. (Ellen groaning) Mm-hmm. Ask some questions, it'll take your mind off the pain. - How do I know you're really from back there? - Well, we own our own cars. - Uh huh. - And when we get angry, we yell at each other, and we have problems, but we work 'em out. (Ellen panting) And we play with 52 cards. (Ellen groaning) Oh, you're doing great. - [Ellen] Mm-hmm. (suspenseful music) - We laugh, we cry. It's a messier world. (Ben sighs) We perform surgery that actually heals people. Elvis is dead. - What? You mean, Elvis is alive here? - He's performing at the Bowl tonight. - Aw, I wish I could see that. - Outside the hospital, there's a ramp. At the end of it, there's stairs down to the street. Meet me down there. - Okay. - Goodnight. Finally! Hey, that's great, thank you very much, Nurse. I just need to be alone with Nurse Lorenzo. - All right, you don't need me, Doctor? - No. I'm glad you're here. I want you to see this, and I want you to make a report. I'm supposed to be operating on Ellen Moretti right now. - [Lorenzo] Yes. - This is Ellen Moretti, she's been done, for hours. - What's she doin' here? - That's what I'm asking. Take her to recovery room seven. Meet me in my office. I'm gonna do some investigating. (Ben sighs) I gotta kick some ass. Do you know that expression? - No. But I like it. - Get it, get it, Genghis, Genghis. (Melody laughing) (phone ringing) Grab it! Hello. - It's, uh, it's me. (sullen music) I, you know, I've been thinkin' that, uh, your life was probably a lot more peaceful before I got back. - Well, yeah, but, don't say that. - You know that I love you, right? - Yeah. - I loved ya since I set your broken arm back when I was an intern. - You know, I hardly remember those days. - I remember them. We'd go to Griffith Park at midnight and the wet grass and the (sighs), the smell of your hair and your skin. I swear to god, I'll never forget that. - Ben. When are you coming home? (Ben sighs) Mm. (Melody sighs) (tense music) - One stinking drawer! (John grunting) Ah, ah, come on! (John sighs) (John sighs) One bullet. I get it. I'm not supposed to last. I'm not supposed to make it! (people chattering) - [Announcer] Dr. White to attitude adjustment. Dr. White to attitude adjustment. - Miss. Stop that patient, please. - Is everything all right? - You won't be needing this anymore. - Oh, oh. (laughs) Thank you. - Oh, you just have to check your papers at the release desk. - Oh, I have them right here. - [Announcer] A non-performing vehicle has been parked at admitting. Be advised that authorities have been called impound it. Stay tuned and thank you. - All set then. (Ellen sighs) - Thank you. - Ellen. (tense music) Is there someone meeting you? - Yes, across the street. - [Nurse] Would you like someone to walk you over? - No, but thank you. Thanks anyway. Stay even. (people chattering) - Moretti! You'll have to come back. - Oh, I'm fine, Doctor, I've been released. - Oh, I'm sorry, but you will have to, Don, have you seen Ben Creed? - No, I haven't, Doctor. - Well, he was supposed to do a Thurston on this patient, but look at this. Standard alteration, and she's already released. - [Don] This doesn't look right. I don't see a skull flap incision at all. - [Ben] Ellen, run! Let's go! - Ben! Ben, what are you? (Ben groans) - [Ellen] Come on, come on! (tense music) - [Ben] This one right here. (Don groaning) - What the hell is happening? - [Ellen] Hurry! - Call the police, the same ones that brought Moretti in. - What's happening with Ben? - Call them! (people chattering) - So, what's up? - Looks like we've got ourselves a couple of strays working. - Oh, yeah? Ah, look who we have here. Let's go in for the bonus game. - Yeah, let's go for it. - [Ellen] Don't speed. - [Ben] I'm not. You know, I can't believe I actually miss traffic. - [Ellen] Do you know where you're going? - Is Caltech in the same place over here? - Yes. So, make a left. - I knew that. I knew a man who said that where you live is like a marriage. You have to work at it, fix it. You can never run away from it. - Smart man. - Yeah. - [Ellen] Mm. - You have people waiting for you on the other side? - Well, most of my colleagues probably think I'm dead. - What, what about family? - A cat. - Huh, most single women have cats. - They're a symbol of independence. - Most single men have dogs. - That's because they like something servile around them. (Ben laughs) Just a theory. (dramatic music) - [Man] All set. - Sign here. - Oh my god, that's it, stop! That's it, that's my chamber. - That's your reentry equipment? - They've taken it apart. - Can you put it back together again? - I don't see how. Follow it. - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, this is a special area-wide bonus mobile game. No need to register, everyone is eligible. Just watch for the distribution van. (car horns honking) (crowd yelling) Ladies and gentlemen, I have an exciting announcement. We are about to begin a bonus game. This is a special area-wide. - Maybe we'll win a million dollars. - No, it's not that kinda game. - What do you mean? - (sighs) It's what they have instead of crime. They pick people randomly and. - And what? - The candidate are Dr. Benjamin Creed and Ellen Moretti. - Damn it. - Repeat. Dr. Benjamin Creed-- - It's not random. They use the game. - And Ellen Moretti. - For what? - For execution. (suspenseful music) I need this truck. - What, what did you do that for? (Ben groans) - [Ben] Ellen, just get in the cab. - Okay. - Get out of the truck, okay? Get out! - Hey, you can't do that. - Can I help you? - Stay even, pal. - [Announcer] Dr. Benjamin Creed and Miss Ellen Moretti have spotted on 44th Court in Hanford. (announcer drowned out by tires screeching) Street and Catherine Avenue North. - Hey, they're over here! (crowd yelling) (tense music) - One, two, three, four, 4 1/2. (twigs snapping) (peaceful music) Hi. (twigs snapping) Emmett! (John sighs) - Do I know you? - [John] I guess not, but you remind me of someone I knew. (exciting music) - Ladies and gentlemen, for the greater Los Angeles area, we have two candidates, two targets. The candidates are Dr. Benjamin Creed and Ellen Moretti. Repeat, Dr. Benjamin Creed and Ellen Moretti. (Melody sighs) Repeat, this is a special area-wide-- - My poor honey. - [Announcer] Bonus game. (suspenseful music) (Ellen panting) - Oh no! - What do you mean, no? No. - No, I can't-- - Don't say no. - I need wiring and connectors and materials to rebuild this! - You can do this! You can definitely-- - It could take years! - You can do it, I know you can. All Emmett has was a pad. - Oh, that's impossible. - He had a flat pad with wiring around it. - All he used was a grounding pad. - [Ben] Yeah. - That little genius. - [Ben] Oh no. Uh. Listen, uh, Ellen, Ellen. - What, what? (crowd murmuring) - Just, just get back into the cab. - Yeah. - What about this? - (sighs) A sun screen? Don't be ridiculous. Let's go! - Emmett used something like this for the grounding pad. - He did? Yeah, it might work, not bad. - Well, I am a brain surgeon. - Well, let's go. You know, I still need some wirings and clips and-- (loud banging) - [Man] Come on out! - Let's go! Start the truck! - [Ben] I'm tryin! I'm trying! - [Ellen] Oh my god, no! No! Look out! Oh my god! Come on, let's get out of here! - [Man] They're in here! - Look out! (Ellen gasps) (Ellen panting) Ben, you're gonna hit them. - They're bluffing. - What if they're not? - They're bluffing! - What if they're not? - [Ben] They're bluffing! - What if they're not? Ben! (Ben screaming) What if they're not? Ah! (Ellen screams) (crowd screaming) - We now have a candidate sighting. Creed and Moretti are in a truck and moving through South Pasadena. - Hey, go on, let's go, let's go. - [Ellen] Hurry up. - All right, stand back, stand back. - Whoa, no, no, no, wait, what are you doing? No crime, remember? (gentle music) - [Ben] Yeah, I know, it's amazing. ♪ Well the light, but it's fading lucky lady ♪ - [Ellen] Wow. ♪ And I think ♪ - [Ben] Come on! - Still, it's great. (laughs) Hey, find me a wall socket, will ya? - [Ben] Okay, yeah. - Uh, I need wiring, perfect, unravel that. - [Ben] Okay. - Yes, yes, yes, love this store. (tense music) (Ellen groaning) Damn packaging! Where's the sun shield? (Ben groans) - We left it in the truck. - (groans) You left it in the truck, brain surgeon. Can you go get it, please? - Yeah, I'll get it. All right. (Ellen groans) (audience cheering) (tense music) (man screaming) (man groaning) - [Man] Guys, over here! (man grunts) (Ben grunting) (man groaning) Leave us alone! Why don't you just leave us alone? - No, no, don't hurt me, don't hurt me. Don't kill me. - Get outta here! Here we go. - [Ellen] Yeah, just spread it out over there. Okay. (crowd screaming) - [Man] We gotta get in there! - I'm not gonna say it. - [Ellen] What? - I'm not gonna say it. I'm not gonna say it! I'm not gonna say, hurry up! - Shut up! - [Ben] Ellen, you go ahead without me! - What, no, no way! Get over here and take off your belt. - What? - Take off your belt and get on top of me. - I'm, uh, I'm flattered, but-- - No, you need to take off your belt and wrap it around your wrist to ground us. Understand? - [Ben] Yes. (crowd screaming) (Ellen gasps) (electrical whirring) (Ellen screams) - [Tom] 1-800-5800-TOM is our telephone number. - Oh! - Sorry. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Do you hate your life? - Yeah, you? - Yeah. - Terry on a car phone. - Sorry. - [Terry] Oh, I can't say that I hate L.A., and it's often hard, but I don't like it. - We're just, uh. - Do you think it sucks? - [Ben] Just, uh, yeah. - [Terry] It's dirty, it's dirtiest city I ever lived in. (Ben panting) - Just looking for, uh. (siren wailing) (Ellen sighs) Oh man, it smells terrible. - Yeah, smog, mm. - Uh, traffic. (laughs) - We're home. (laughs) (metal clanging) - Whoa, tiger, you're gonna need that to hit some home runs. Come on, boys!
