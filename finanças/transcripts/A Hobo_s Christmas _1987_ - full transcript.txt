(gentle music) (train rumbling) (train horn blowing) - And the Christmas before that, Harold and me was deep in the heart of Texas. Pink grapefruit, finest in America, ours for the picking. And last year, we had our turkey in Phoenix. Cincinnati Harold piled on at the mission to bake pies. Harold's pies are legendary. - You bought a new shirt and tie in Boise, Chance. - And they say my hobo stew is legendary also. - You haven't bought a new anything for Christmas as long as I've known you. - Yeah, well, this year I changed my mind. - All along, you've been planning a stop in Salt Lake. - You should be able to find work in Salt Lake in the rail yards, unloading Christmas trees. - California is warm, only a day away. - Busiest time of the year, the week before Christmas. - Why stop in Salt Lake? - You wanna go on, Harold, go on. I'm not holding you back. - I might just do that. - Shouldn't matter to you anyway, Harold. You always sleep through Christmas, anyhow. (cheerful festive music) This your first Christmas away from home? - Yeah, me and Carolina both. - This Christmas counts 25 I've been away from home. - You'll learn, the worst place to be anywhere is Christmas. (train horn blowing) (cheerful festive music) - They'll be ready to unload those trees within the hour. - Well, good luck to you. - And you, too. - Merry Christmas to you. - You, too. - You're up to something, the new shirt, the tie. - It's my son. He's living in Salt Lake now. - Ah, I should've figured it. How many years you talked about seeing him. - Too many. That's why I'm here. I'm going down to the Y, and shower and shave, and put on that new tie. - What if this reunion don't work? - Then I'm gonna be on the first train out of here tonight. - I'll be waiting for you. Pick me up at the mission. Christmas and that boy are a memory. Leave it be. (cheerful music) - [Boy] If it comes down to the aquarium and the dog, I'll take the dog. - [Man] That's it? - [Boy] Today it is. - Uh-huh. - Bye, Dad. - Bye. - Dad, what's the capital of Missouri? - Jefferson City. Hey, wait up. I haven't heard your list yet. - You haven't told us what you want for Christmas. - I asked first. - Can't policemen ever be with their families on Christmas Day? - Is that what you want for Christmas? (school bell ringing) - [Girl] Bye, Daddy. - Bye bye, pumpkin. See you later. (children chatting) - Bigger. - Well, Slim, Topeka, Omaha. I didn't expect to find you boys so far north this time of year. - You either, Chance. Guess we all heard Santa's hiring bowls this year. - Well, just shows the old boy knows what he's doing, huh. - (chuckles) I hope so. - Well, I'm heading into town. See ya. (gentle harmonica music) (cheerful music) - Good morning, Mrs. Ellenbottom. Aerobics in the gymnasium, geriatrics council meets in Wing C. Your key and your towel, Mr. Brensdale. Nutrition in your Less Stress, More Life seminar starts at 8:30 in Room 205. It's just up the stairs and to your right. - Morning. - 75 cents for the shower, 50 cents for the towel. - I said "Good morning." - Soap will be 25. And if you needed the locker, it's 75. It's the new transient rates. - You know, when I was your age, just starting out, we had a saying, "Courtesy pays big dividends and doesn't cost a penny." 49, dollar. 50. Have a nice day. - [Charlie] I was counting on having Christmas off this year. - You and a hundred others. - My kids want me home this year. - You will be, by 4:30, Christmas Day. - Lieutenant, you have told me that for the past two years now. - We run this department strictly on seniority. Come on in. I have something for you. When you take these gifts to the hospital, take this with you. (bells jingling) Tell Laurie I'm sorry, but I'm turning in my Santa suit. - Lieutenant, you know you've become a Christmas tradition for those kids. - Well, this Christmas, the tradition is gonna be sitting in the sand and sun in Hawaii. Two weeks. - Sounds great. - It's our first year without our kids at home. My wife wants a change. Laurie found me, she'll find another Santa. Maybe she'll get you to do it. And, Grovner, next year you will have seniority. And maybe the day off. (dispatch speaking indistinctly) (Chance singing indistinctly) ♪ Made his home the water fountain ♪ ♪ Near the lemonade swing where the bluebirds sing ♪ ♪ On the good raw candy mountain ♪ (sniffing) (melancholy music) (cheerful music) (bell jingling) (indistinct chatter) - You fellows wanna take a seat over there and I'll call the officer on duty. What do you want? - I'm here to see my son. - Okay, the jail is down the hall, up two flights of stairs and to your right. - No. He's not in jail. - Sergeant Jameson. You wanna bail him out? Bail is posted straight down the hallway, to your left right after the Christmas tree. - My son is a policeman. - Well, what took you so long to say so? - Charles Grovner. Officer Charles Grovner, Junior. - [Charlie] Uh-uh. No way, not me. I'm too skinny. - No, you're not! We could put a little padding right here, a little bit right there. - Hey, cut it out. You don't have enough padding for me. - (laughing) Come on, Charlie. Give me a ho ho ho. - Sorry, I'm on duty that day. - What about Christmas Day? - 4:30. It's the best I could do. - Well, I'm off at noon. - (sighs) Mrs. Morgan could come over earlier, I guess. - Well, good, she and I can get the turkey started. - Uh. Great, carry that for me. - Thanks. - So, what do you hear from San Francisco? - Well, they made the offer. - [Charlie] And? - And I'm thinking about it. - Well, it'd be a good opportunity for you. Bigger hospital, more responsibility. More money. There's a lot to be said for that. - Well, I told them I'd let them know. - When? - Right after Christmas. - Well, as it happens, I may have the week after Christmas off. I thought it'd be a good time for us to get away. - Charlie. - Together, alone. - If I do take the job, they want me to start right away. - Oh. (phone ringing) - [Laurie] San Francisco's not the end of the world, you know? - Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. - Did you get your Christmas list from the kids yet? - [Woman] Call for you, Charlie. - Um, Bobby, an aquarium or a dog, and Kathy's still making her mind up. Hello. - [Woman] Dr. (indistinct), Physical Therapy. - He said what? - That he's your father. Yeah, an old guy. He's standing right here. - All right, thanks. I'll be right down. - Charlie? What happened? - He's here. - Who? Who's here? - My father. (solemn music) - Thank you. (tin cans jingling) Hello, son. - [Charlie] What are you doing here? - It's Christmas. - Where are you staying? - Most of the fellows are staying down at the mission. - I'll give you a ride. (gentle solemn music) (tires squealing) You show up. You just show up. Why are you here? - Because it's time. - Not by my clock. Time. Where have you been for the last 25 years? - I went by the old neighborhood last summer. - And found out where we were. You keep sending your cards. - I learned your wife had died. - [Charlie] Look, if it's money you want... - No, I'm not here for money. I work for a living. I pay my way, I always have. I'm here because I wanna spend Christmas with you. - You haven't earned the right. (car horn honking) - I wanna know the grandchildren that I never met. - I did not invite you here. - Not many more Christmases left, Charlie. (soft music) Hi, how are you doing? - [Man] How'd it go? (crickets chirping) (dog barking) - Last year, you didn't get home till after dark. - Well, this Christmas will be better than last. - Will Laurie be here? - Yeah, about noon. Mrs. Morgan will be over even earlier, and you guys can get started on the turkey. - What are you giving Laurie for Christmas? - I'm still making up my mind. - Did she get the job in San Francisco? - Uh, no, not yet. - Will she? - What's Laurie giving you? - I don't know. - You don't ask what someone's giving you for Christmas. - Yeah, well, I do. Dad, when are we getting the tree? - Soon. - How soon? - Couple of days. - Last year, we had to wait until the day before Christmas. - Dad, I like Laurie. But I miss mom. A lot. Why can't Christmas be the way it used to be? - I know, baby. I know. - [Harold] Don't say I didn't warn you. - And I heard you the first time. You could've saved yourself trouble if you'd have listened. - Get off my back, Harold. - Harold's rule of the road. - Knock it off, Harold. - A hobo can go anywhere except home again. Let's go, Chance. - I thought he'd ask me to stay. (train horn blaring) - [Kathy] Dad, Laurie's here! - Hi. You had supper? - Yeah, I had something at work. - What do you think? - Charlie, it's beautiful. - Yeah. Well, if business keeps up this way, I might just hang up the uniform and do this full time. - Ex-steel worker becomes successful wood worker. - Sounds pretty good to me. - I thought I was gonna get to meet your dad. - Well, you thought wrong. - Well, excuse me. - He thought I was gonna invite him to stay for Christmas. - Yeah, well, what's wrong with that? - (sighs) My father and I don't need to hurt each other all over again. - Oh, Charlie, you said that was a long time ago. - Which is exactly where its gonna stay. It's not your family. - I can take a hint. - No, I didn't tell the kids. - Well, don't you think Bobby and Kathy have a right to meet their own grandfather? - I sent my father away. - You didn't answer my question. Don't shut me out. Look, it's between me and my father, okay? - No, it's not okay. (Laurie sighs) Boy, you sure don't make it easy for me, do you? I'm trying to get to know the whole Charlie. I mean, how can we ever talk about the future if you're so unwilling to talk about the past? Those kids upstairs have a right to meet their grandfather. Goodnight, Charlie. (melancholic music) - Damn you. Good morning, Mrs. Morgan. Thanks for coming over. The kids are already asleep. - Oh, good. Police work calling you out, Charlie? - [Charlie] No, ma'am. - Sounded very urgent. - It's, uh, personal business. Kind of an important errand. - Chance Grovner? Never heard of him. Besides, even if we did know him, we got you marked for a cop. - He told me down at the mission he was headed this way. He's my father. (soft music) - [Harris] Well, I for one need some California sun. My bones ache here. - [Chance] You know, you've been complaining about cold since I met you. Get to California, you'll complain about the heat. - Railroad cops, he's spotted us. Come on. This used to be a safe yard. - [Harris] Yeah, the world used to be safe, too. You don't count on nothing except your pals. - [Chance] Come on, this way. Come on, Harry, down here. Come on, come on, hurry up. - One day. I give you one day. (solemn music) (cheerful music) (Chance snoring) (gentle music) (Chance coughs) - How come he sleeps with his shoes on his chest? - You'll have to ask him. - [Kathy] You said you'd take him to hockey practice. Ask him then. - [Charlie] Well, whatever you do, you two are in charge of your granddad. - [Bobby] Can't he stay more that one day? - [Charlie] (sighs) He's a traveling man. He never stays anywhere long. - That's why he's a hobo. - [Charlie] Exactly. - [Bobby] A hobo has to be somewhere on Christmas. - [Charlie] All right, look, just remember he is an older man. Don't expect him to be able to do everything you want him to do. - Well, I'm too old for hockey. - Hi, I'm Bobby. I peeked and saw you last night when Dad carried me into my sister's room. - Well, good morning, Bobby. - I'm Kathy. - Morning, Kathy. - Coffee? - Ah, yes, thank you, I would. I recognize a good deal of that furniture up in your room, Bobby. I made some of that for your father when he was your age. - I gotta be going. You just tell Bobby and Kathy whatever it is you wanna do. Come here. - [Bobby] When do we get the tree? - Tomorrow, first thing. - Granddad can stay that long. Can't you? - The best trees are down at the rail yard. Last shipment before Christmas came in yesterday. - [Charlie] I'll be home by six. - What would you like for breakfast? - This year I want a big tree, to the top of the ceiling. - Some toast and juice. And more coffee, please. I always made choosing the tree a very special time. - When you were home. - Well, today I am home. The whole day with both of you. - I'll go get on my uniform. - What's a hobo? - A man who works as he travels. (festive music) And always carry a couple of quarters in your shoes. Good for bus rides and telephone calls. - How come you sleep with your shoes on your chest? - Well, because that way they're as close to me as if I was wearing them. Good shoes are important to a hobo. Good shoes and a good road to travel them with. Okay, in you go. There you are. (whistle blowing) - [Coach] Concentrate. - [Boy] Come on, pass it. - There you go. - How come you've never come to see us before? - Well, I, uh- - Daddy says he was my age when you left home. - You're not here because you're sick or dying, are you? - No, Bobby. I'm here because it's Christmas. - You sure? - I'm sure. - Why did you leave home? - Well, Kathy, think of it this way. Long time ago, there was this man. - You. - Yeah. Me. Growing up, there wasn't a thing in this world that I was afraid to take on. I never did less than well in anything I ever tried. I was a salesman, a traveling salesman. Came a time for change, I guess too many changes for me. How much has your father told you about me? - He never talks about you. But he keeps your postcards and your pictures down in the basement. Bobby and I knew what you looked like right away. - [Bobby] Granddad! (groans) (whistle blows) (both laughing) (players speaking indistinctly) (gentle music) Granddad! - Yeah? Just admiring your dad's work down here. - We're getting a tree tomorrow morning. And I told dad you'd be here to help us. - Oh, that's the boy. Just great. Good, good. (gentle music) (cheerful music) (people chattering) - Kathy, this way! Follow me. - So was this one always off and running like Bobby is? - [Bobby] Granddad! - He was a real handful. Curiosity, and this that and everything in between. - Granddad! - Yeah, coming, Bobby. (Laurie laughing) - Looks like you've added another kid to the family. - Well, Bobby insisted that he stay on and help with the tree. You were right. The kids deserve to see their granddad. (people chattering) - Carolina, Cajun, merry Christmas! - $2! Am I getting $2? - Yeah, my grandkids. - About the other night, I didn't mean to shut you out like that. I apologize. - [Laurie] Apology accepted. - By the way, if you do take that job in San Francisco, I just wanted you to know that a team of wild horses and I are gonna come there and drag you back. - Yeah? - Yeah. - That's fine. Keep on going. - Which did you do the longest, salesman or hobo? - Salesman. Yeah, there they are, stay right there. - [Bobby] What? - (sighs) Just watch. We'll wind up with the most expensive tree in the lot. Douglas fir. - Douglas fir, that's why. Ah, yeah. This is more like it. You won't find a more beautiful tree ever grown. Sometimes they grow as high as 100 feet tall. - Costs a lot. - [Chance] At my age, I'm past putting a price on Christmas. - You know, last year we just got pine. - Yeah, I know it's a good charge but this year, they're a little dry. - Over here, of course, we have the nobles. - No, no, no, no. Too picked over. - Blue spruce. - Too much sap. - Well, I have heard that the Douglas fir does give you more tree than money. - Lasts twice as long, too. - Mm-hmm. Sold. - Made a good choice, Son. Ah, put that away. Come on, kids, lend a hand. - No, no, no, no. Hold on, now Charlie. Now wait a minute. - [Charlie] I do believe this is the best tree we ever had. Here we go. - So Charlie tells me you used to be quite the salesman. - No, I've got money, I could've paid for that tree. Charlie, hold up there, will you? Look, Son. (gentle music) I carved these heads out of apples during the harvest season up in the state of Washington. - When I was your age, he carved new decorations every year. - Yeah, I've been carving and whittling since I was your age, Bobby. - Well, easy to see where you get your talent with wood. - Hey, kids, come here, take a look at this. This is a hobo knife. See, this blade here is for carving and whittling. That one there is a can opener. And this here is a scissors. For sewing. Sewing on buttons and the like. Charlie, remember that Christmas turkey I won at Oliver Henry's hardware store in Chester, Pennsylvania? - The one you bought a ticket for on the Pennsylvania railroad. - Hold on, you two. A ticket for a turkey on a train? - True story. - What happened to the turkey? - Well, he sat in the seat beside me all the way home to Pittsburgh. (Laurie laughs) Your grandmother and I were there to meet the train. - When I stepped off that train, I was leading a 16 pound Tom turkey. - Yeah, with a collar around its neck and a string. - And I said to your father, "Sharpen up the axe, Son." - Oh, boy. I looked at him, and he looked back down at me and he said, "Well, you do want turkey for Christmas dinner, don't you? - (chuckling) You cut its head off? - Sure scared I was gonna have to. But you just laughed at me and told me not to worry, and led the turkey away and put it in a taxicab. - (laughing) Oh! - A turkey in a taxicab? - I swear, and there were two nuns in the cab. (all laughing) - I'd heard that the nuns up at St. Rita's Home for Wayward Girls were in need of a Christmas turkey. So thanks to me and that bird their dream came true. - Tell us another story. - Yeah, come on, just one more. - Well, now, let me see, let me see. Well, now there was that year that Ned Tomkins, over at the barber shop, was gonna play Santa Claus at the health club Christmas party. So he called me up that morning, he said, "Chance, you gotta help me out. You gotta play Santa Claus." (children laughing) I said, "Why? What's the matter, Ned?" And he said, "Well, to tell you the truth, I went to a party last night. And I got there a little too early and I stayed there a little too late." (Laurie and kids laughing) - [Bobby] What happened to Ned Tomkins? - Oh, he was run over by a reindeer. (both laughing) No, no, no. That's the truth. It was. Really. Yup. Really. (all laughing) - [Chance] This is the cross my heart, hope to die truth. - [Laurie] He's a very proud man. - [Charlie] Well, he never lacked for pride. - But he wanted to buy that tree. You know, he had out that leather purse. You just brushed him off. - I guess I was too busy thinking about just how easily he conned me into that tree. - Well, I think he's really trying to get to know you, so you should give him equal time. - The man I still see is the one that left 25 years ago. - Charlie, find out who he is now, why he's here. - I've already told you, the only reason he is here is for the kids. - Try, Charlie. (children laughing) - The way they're taking to him he could be Father Christmas himself. - Father Christmas. But you're right. - What? - He's perfect. He's Santa Claus. Well, no, at the party. At the children's party. - I don't think so. - So I took the turkey into the dining car for lunch. I just had a sandwich. He had a chocolate sundae. No nuts. (kids laughing) - Are you all alone when you ride the rails? - No, no, I have friends. - Who? - Well, the Topeka kid, Biloxi Slim, Omaha John Boswell. My best friend is Cincinnati Harold. - Do they all sleep with their shoes on their chest? - Absolutely. (Bobby giggles) - What do you eat when you ride the rails? - Hobo stew, what else? - What's hobo stew? - Oh, well, now, that's a secret. But I'll teach you how to make it one day. It's just plain stick-to-your-ribs delicious. - You remember that Sunday we drove up to Park City, and you were determined that you were gonna teach the kid from Pittsburgh how to ski? - (laughing) Oh, boy, it wasn't easy. - I fell down a lot. - Yeah? - Yeah. (gentle music) Um, anyway, uh... When it comes to telling you how I feel about you, I, uh, I'm just as clumsy. - Charlie, I've been thinking this, this move to San Francisco, it could be the best thing for both of us. - Made up your mind, huh? - Well, you have priorities. You have the kids, two jobs, you had a wife you loved very much. - This time you're not answering my question. - No. No, I haven't decided yet. I only know if you just let me- - I don't want you to go. - We have been seeing each other for a year and I think we've fallen in love. But Charlie, we are standing still. Just when I think I'm getting close to you, you close me off. (gentle music) - You kids haven't told me what you want for Christmas yet. - I want a dog, she wants a piano. - Bobby! - Ow. But she hasn't told Dad. - Oh? Why not? Why haven't you told him? - I was taking lessons. My mother died, so I stopped playing. I think about her a lot. - I told dad if I can't have a dog, I want an aquarium. - Well, if you don't tell you father you want a piano, he can't buy one for you. - Maybe I'll tell him, maybe I won't. - Night, Kathy. Night, Bobby. - [Both] Night. - Did you really buy a train ticket for a turkey? - Now could I make up a story like that? - (chuckles) I think you could. - [Bobby] Where are my shoes? (gentle music) - Still selling. Still at it. I thought I'd wait until morning to tell them goodbye. - [Charlie] You know damn well they want you to stay. You're making sure they want you to stay. - [Chance] All right, I am. But right now, I'm waiting to hear it from you. - You wanna stay, stay. - You're the one I came to see. I'm waiting to hear it now. Yes or no? I want the vote to be unanimous. - If I tell you to go, you know who the kids are gonna blame. Me. - I'm not talking about- - I'll be the fall guy. I'm talking about us. - [Charlie] No, I'm not gonna tell you to leave. You came for Christmas, you stay for Christmas. But you just remember this, when it's time for you to leave you're the one who's gonna have to face your grandchildren. - [Chance] All right, Bobby, time for the potatoes. There we go, right there. That's it. And the corn, Kathy. There we are. And the onions, Bobby. - Whew. - There we go. Carrots, right, in they go next. And the beer. Yeah, I'll pour that and you stir, huh. There we are. All right, and now the cabbage. - Well, let's not forget five pounds of Polish sausage. - Okay, in it goes. Cabbage, cabbage, cabbage. What did you do with the cabbage, huh? - I couldn't find the cabbage. - She hates cabbage. - Oh, yeah? Well, you're gonna love this. - Yuck. - Yes, sir, vitamin-packed stick-to-your-ribs hobo stew! Cooks for three hours, keeps a man going for three days. - If it's so good, why isn't he here to eat his own cooking? - He's working down in the basement. - You can only cook hobo stew outside in a garbage can. (Bobby chuckles) - Well, I'll just take him a bowl full of his own medicine. - I'll take it to- - No, no, no. Thank you. (Bobby sighs) - I wanted to take it to him. - Daddy wants to talk to him. - How do you know? - Because I know. - Know what? - All you do is ask questions. You're such a geek. - At least I didn't hide my cabbage under my sausage. - Yeah? Who's there? - [Charlie] Bringing your supper down. - Now hold it, hold it. Just a second. I wish I could tell you what I'm up to, but I won't. You know, in my shop at home, I have my lathe just where you have yours. You're doing fine work here, Son. (exclaims) Hobo stew. Just plain- - Vitamin-packed, stick-to-the-ribs hobo stew. You know Bobby and Kathy have never eaten carrots, they have never eaten onions, - Did Kathy try the cabbage? - They have never had beer, which only goes to show what a liking they've taken to you. (Chance chuckles) I don't want them hurt when you leave. - You think I want that? - Well, the only way you ever wanted to be close to anybody is on your own terms, always coming back and never staying. Always thinking of yourself. My father, the hobo who ran away from the real world. You were always running, always looking for the easy way out. - What do you know about my world? How do you know how I felt? - Look I didn't come down here to pick a fight, all right? - Yeah. You could've fooled me. - You say you always work wherever you go. Well, I got a job for ya. You do so well with Bobby and Kathy, I'm sure you'll work out just fine as Santa Claus. - Santa Claus? - Yeah. For Laurie and the kids over at the hospital. - Look, I'm not playing Santa Claus, not in front of a bunch of kids. I wouldn't know what to do! - We will talk about this in the morning over the finest breakfast you've had had in years. - [Chance] I will not play Santa Claus! (gentle music) (door slams) ♪ See the pyramids ♪ - Hi. ♪ Along the Nile ♪ - My kinda place, Charlie. All those years I was traveling, this was my kind of place. Look, if there's gonna be any talk at this meal about playing Santa Claus, forget it because you're taking the job. - Won't hear it from me. Always used to say the food was better at the counter. - Yeah, 25 years ago. Those were my salesman days, remember? - Always on the road. Trains mostly. - Mm-hmm. Pittsburgh to Philly, south to Washington DC, north to Trenton. Far west as Cleveland. - Everything from war surplus canteens and rubber rafts, bats and balls, hula hoops. Mom said you sold it all. - Oh. I sure did. 25 years ago. That was the last time. Remember the home office? Home office, Charlie, where all of us salesmen used to gather once a month. Exchange ideas, swap stories, collect our bonuses, Johnny Acres in from the south, Bill O'Grady in from New York, Buck Marshall from the far west. We were the road. - Territory. (sighs) You know, three years ago, I lost my job at the steel mill. 25 years ago you lost yours as a salesman. You ran away, I didn't. Why? - Well... It started small enough. I was selling baseball gloves. These gloves were genuine Texas cowhide leather. Only thing was, uh, the big chains were selling those same gloves, too. Pretty soon they were buying up all the mom and pop stores who were my customers, people I sold to. Everything was moving out of the shopping centers. Downtown's died. I was a hotel man in a motel world. - More coffee, fellas? - No, just check please. - Friday nights, we've got you home. Friday night fights on TV. Seemed to you like Ruby Goldstein was always the referee? (Chance chuckles) We'd get you for weekends. And early Monday morning you'd be gone. One week, white shirts were still hanging in the closet. Ties were on the rack. All the shoes nice and neat in a row. One hat missing. Panama straw, summertime. Mom said you were trying a different line. New road, different territory. - Yeah, remember all those years I tried to come back? Even if it was only for a week at a time. Trouble was each time I came back, it became more difficult. - Why? Why did it become more difficult? - In my day it was the man who was the provider for the family. I'd just become an out-of-work salesman. - Became a hobo. - I worked, I sent money home - Hey, I was just a kid, I was home. You were gone. Think I wanted to put my arms around money? - Don't you think that that hurt me, too? All I was trying to do was provide for you and your mother as best I could. - Times changed, you were just too damn proud to change with 'em. - I'd lost my life's work. - Yeah, the proud salesman, the man who was the territory. - No, I had no territory. I had no profession. - And when they were gone, your pride sent you running. - Running, me, no, never. - And when you did, you left us behind! - Do you think I've wrote, sent those post cards and pictures home, because I was trying to leave you and your mother behind? All I knew was, that I'd failed your mother, and I was failing you. I told him, "No way, no way am I gonna play some Santa Claus." - Well, somebody forgot to tell me. - Yeah, so he invited me out to breakfast. - That must have been nice. - I never had a better breakfast or a worse time. - (chuckling) Humbug. - First thing you know, he conned me into playing Santa Claus. - Here, try the whiskers. - I don't know where'd he learn all that sort of stuff. - Can you hold still? - He tricked me. He said he was coming over here so he could play Santa Claus. - Well I'm in charge and I wanted you. Charlie's too skinny. Now, here, try on this hat. - You think so much of my son. Why don't you do something about him? - Sit down. I'll fix your boots. - He's a widower with two children. Now, if you two are on your way to falling in love why don't you do something about it. - Whatever is to be worked out, if it is, Charlie and I will work it out in our time, in our own way. - Hey, the kids are ready. Uh, we've told them not to throw things at you this year. - Throw things at Santa Claus? - Yeah, we've tried to get rid of all the bubblegum. - Bubblegum? Look, what is this? - Yeah, you know, gets in the beard. - All right, here's the sack. We're ready to go. - Oh, gentle Jesus, meek and mild, if Harold could only see me now.

I wanna ask you a question. - Ah, that's fair enough. - Why can't you and Daddy be friends? - Well, you remember that little conversation we had that day at the skating rink? - Why you became a hobo? - Yeah. Well this is the only family I have left, and I tried to move back into it. But your father wasn't ready for me to move back into his life. His, or yours, or Bobby's. - But Daddy wants to love you. I know he does. I told you, he saved your pictures. - Now it's my turn to ask a question. - Fair enough. - How do you feel about Laurie and your father? - I like her and so does Daddy, a lot. - Oh, good. Because I think your father and maybe one day you and Bobby will need her in your life more than you need me. - When are you leaving? - Morning after Christmas I'll be gone before you're even awake. - Now that you know where we live, you'll come back every Christmas, won't you? - I'd like that, I'd like that very much. - I'm glad I waited up for you. - So am I. Good night. - Good night. (gentle music) - [Laurie] New shoes? That's all you could think to get him? - What else do I know about him? He travels. - Well, what else have you two been talking about for the past three days? - Oh, way we were, why he's here. - [Laurie] And? - (sighs) And he's brought up a lot of old feelings. Not all of them about him. - About Karen? - I'll change. That guy is like me. (Charlie sighs) I worked in mills. Steel's what we knew. And all of a sudden one day, we're out of work. And I mean for good. Do you have any idea what's that like? - No. - I was afraid. Where was the work gonna come from? And I was scared to death to leave the city, neighborhood, where I'd been born and raised. - And married. - And married. Karen and I got married right out of high school. We, uh... We were so much in love, we just couldn't wait to get married. - [Girl] Come on, let's go over to the pet store. - I want to see the doggie. - Yeah. - [Woman] Come on, come on, you girls. Stay with mother. - (clears throat) It was her idea to move west, you know? I, uh... I was always pretty good with my hands. And I thought I could open a small furniture making business. Then Karen died. Such small dreams, you know? Place to live, work, place to bring up the kids. There's this, uh, tavern near the mill. A place where all the guys, we used to go and have a beer after work every day. Nowadays, that place is full all day long with guys who were my friends. 'Cause to a lot of them, yesterday is gonna be forever. Anyway, one day I was looking at myself in the mirror behind that bar. And I saw my father. And it scared me. (chuckles) That had scared me because right then I wanted to run. I wanted to run and just, keep running. It was just us, just me and the kids, we came out here. Four days on an interstate, and we'd left an entire lifetime behind. - That was the past, Charlie. - Yeah. This is now. And I've got you in my life. And you make a difference, lady. I want to reach out again. - Let it go, Charlie. - And trust myself. - Let it all out. - (sighs) I want to love again. It's hard, you know? - Yeah. - Yeah. It's hard. (gentle music) (Laurie exhales) - Your dad said we could buy him anything, from a pair of socks to a TV set. - He bought himself a TV set last year. - Socks are boring. Should've made a list. - You were supposed to ask. - Was not! - All right, come on, come on. - You were! - Was not! - The two of you, now stop that. Come on, get in there. Come on, Bobby, be nice to your sister, will you? Why don't you use your imagination? - [Kathy] We tried that last year. - Yeah, and what happened? - Socks and a shirt. - Boring. - You're boring. - I am not. - All right, all right. - Are too. - All right. Come on, over here. (puppies whimpering) Why don't you try it? You're sure? Well, it's only Christmas Eve. Plenty of time to change your mind. Hey, what have you got there? - That one's mine. - Yeah? What makes you so sure? - He brought Daddy here and showed him. - Oh, yeah. - (giggles) Where to now? - Well, now, we're gonna do something special for your father. - All right! - Great! - Just the three of us. (gentle music) Okay, Bobby, this is for you. Yeah, that's for you. Come on, now. Put the money in, Bobby, come on. And don't forget, when the light turns on everyone says, "Cheese!" - [All] Cheese! - [Kathy] Where are we? - Yeah, well, you'll see. My best friends are here. I thought this would be a nice Christmas present for your father from you and Bobby, huh? Come on, come on, Bobby, inside. (indistinct chatter) - [Chance] Hi, boys! - [Man] Hey! - I want you to meet my grandchildren, Bobby and Kathy Grovner. - Hi. - Hey. - Here's Topeka, Biloxi Slim, Omaha John Boswell and over there, that's Cincinnati Harold. - [Kathy] Hi. - [Bobby] Hi. - How soon are we leaving, Chance? - Day after tomorrow, Harold. - California, here we come! (Chance laughing) - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know you didn't bring 'em over here to cook turkeys, Chance. - Yeah, so what's happening? - If I know him, it's got something to do with Christmas. - Well, you're right. These young ones here want you to spend Christmas with them. - Count me out. - It was Granddad's idea. - It figures. Some more stuffing, Omaha. - [Bobby] Don't you wanna hear what it is? - Granddad says that the best present Bobby and I can give our Daddy- - Is for you to have Christmas with us. - Sorry, I go to bed Christmas Eve and sleep right through Christmas. - Day and night. - We want to give you to our Daddy as a Christmas present. - We didn't know what to get him. - I'll say. - Now, I want my son to have a big family around by Christmas and I guess you guys are gonna have to be it. - Well, I don't know. - Oh, now look, when was the last time you could do anything for kids or our family, except maybe send a card in the mail or make a telephone call? Harold, you think you're different because you take to your bed at Christmas. Well, let me tell you for all of us, Christmas is the lonesomest time of the year. - Granddad says you'll cook the pies. - You don't cook pies! You bake them. (groans) - Now, Topeka, you'll do the vegetables. - Okay. - Slim, you do the biscuits. - Yeah. - And, Omaha, the salad is all yours. - Yeah. - I'll do the mashed potatoes and the gravy. And, Harold you're in charge. Here's the address, one o'clock, don't be late. - If old Harold have anything to do with Christmas, I'll go along just to watch. (all laughing) - I'll think on it. - Yeah, well, just so long as you don't sleep on it. (all laughing) Hey, come on, you kids. Come on. Let's get home. We got important work to do.

It's beautiful, thank you. - You're welcome, sweetheart. - This one's from all of us. - Well, would you look at the size of that? "To Grandpa, from Bobby, Kathy, and Santa Claus. Well, what have we here? This. (Chance gasps) Well, now, that's really a handsome scarf. Well, I certainly can use these. Oh, yes, indeed. (chuckles) Oh. Will you look at that? What do you think of your old grandfather, huh? Well, you kids certainly know what your old granddad needed. - [Charlie] One more. - Well, I'm doing pretty well here today. I'm afraid you're gonna have to wait until you get back from work for yours, Charlie. Ah. (chuckles) How did you know I always buy myself a pair of shoes at Christmas time, huh? - Well it was Dad's idea. - All we know is you're leaving tomorrow. Here. - Dad, when do we get our presents? - Well, part of Christmas is surprises. - What'd Laurie give you? - I don't know yet. I gotta be going. I will be back by 4:30. - Don't be late. - No. - And don't worry about the turkey. You left Christmas dinner in good hands. - The best. (both giggling) - You all know how I feel about Christmas. I'd rather be in bed. Chance needs our help for Christmas. He's our friend. It's important to him and the grandkids. So, we remember our manners and watch our language in front of kids, ladies, and the cop. Today, we do whatever our buddy Chance asks us to do. All right. Get out your bus fares.

(people chattering) Oh, merry Christmas, Mrs. Morgan. Oh, have you two met? - Yeah, Mrs. Morgan. - Oh, Gladys, please. We met earlier. Him and his friends certainly know how to handle Christmas. Oh, except that one in the kitchen. - Tell me about it. - [Chance] How's it going with those pies, Harold? - They'll be ready when they're ready. (Chance sighs) - Do you need some more stuffing, Laurie? - All right. - [Bobby] Granddad. Potatoes are ready. - Be right there. (men speaking indistinctly) - Oh, I like your shoes. - Yeah, my travel shoes. Charlie gave them to me. Right over there, in back of you, you'll find the pepper and the celery salt and the oregano and the dill for that stuffing of yours. - Thank you. So, what's your specialty? - Thoroughly mashed potatoes and the gravy that goes with 'em. - Mm. All right, I will get started on the dressing. - I, uh... I'll be leaving here tomorrow. - Yes, I heard. - Look, it's, uh, it's none of my business, but, if Charlie asks you to marry him, say "Yes". - You're right, it's none of your business. - If that were my dressing I'd put a tad more pepper in it. - You're not only a sentimentalist, you're a romantic. - (chuckles) Most people would say a romantic was a fool. - Mm-hmm. So what's your role in this family? Hmm? Where's your responsibility? - It's too late for that. - Oh, is it? Who told you it's too late? - [Chance] Nobody has to tell me. Oh, if you're gonna do that dressing, you're gonna need some more- - No. I will make my dressing my way. - I was only trying to help. - You were trying to change the subject. You know, these past few days I blamed Charlie for running away from you. But now I think you're the one who's really running. Now this is none of my business, but maybe it's time to stop. (siren wailing) (siren wailing) - It's Dad! - It's Daddy! - You're home early! Why are you driving this? - Oh, I'm special delivery. - I, uh... I thought it might be nice to have a few friends over to dinner. - Maybe you'd like to ask 'em to give us a hand over here. - Sure, sure, come on, boys. Lend a hand here. - [Man] What in the world have we got here? - Now, young man, I believe that he was tops on your list. - [Bobby] Oh! (puppy whimpering) - [Man] That's nice. - Oh, thanks, Dad. (squeals) Just the one I wanted. - Now, young lady, the top of your list. Had to borrow a paddy-wagon, but I got it here. (Kathy gasps) - Thank you, Daddy. Thank you so much. I love you. - You're welcome, baby. - Now, come on, boys. Come on, give a hand. (men chattering) - [Man] All right. - What is this "A few friends over for dinner?" - Well, it's, uh... It's been so long since anybody, much less a family, has shared Christmas with them that Kathy and Bobby thought that they would like to share Christmas with someone who is less fortunate than they are. - I see. - It's kind of like, like a present for all of us. One day. Today. It was Kathy's idea. - Granddad, it was your idea. - And a good one. (festive music) - [Man] Every kid should have a dog. I haven't had one since I was a kid. - [Man] My sister had a piano she played every day. (men chattering faintly) - It was the meanest, darkest, thundering, lightningest night I'd ever seen on rails in 30 years. Down we came on that runaway freight out of (indistinct) right into the teeth of the storm. - Wherever we went, I was always pleased to come home. - Did you always live in Utah, Gladys? - Born and raised here. Some day, you should take the time to do more than pass through, Chance. - We always pass through. - If you took the time, I'd be pleased to show you the state. - We never stay anywhere more than a few days. - Summer days in the cool of the mountains. Year-round fishing. - Well, certainly something to think about, isn't it, Harold? - Pass the peas. (glass tinkling) - Ladies and gentlemen, before we get to Harold's legendary pies- - They're not ready. - I have an announcement to make. Ladies and gentlemen, when I was a boy, I heard my father say about my grandfather that when a man got older, he always had this wish to be a kid again. To be young, and reach for something he never had, never could have. Now, if my father were here to talk today, I'd say to him that it was tougher as time goes on, to know, not so much what you didn't have as a boy, as what you wanted for your own son. Never got around to putting it under the tree on Christmas morning. And Lord knows I've had as much time to think about that as most fathers. Probably more than most. So, without further gabbing, my Charlie, this is the gift I had in mind to give you over 25 years ago. It's late, but I'm sure you're not too old to enjoy it. All yours, Charlie. - Whoa. Let's move this here. - Careful there now. Yes, there you go. Down easy now. Put it down easy, easy. - [Laurie] Oh, Charlie! (everyone chattering) - Look, there's Pittsburgh! (heartfelt music) - [Harold] Good work, Chance. (train tooting) - You know, in the last few days, we've, uh, had our talks. But this reminds me of something we haven't talked about. That's something I think we both remember. (sighs) When I was young, I remember a lot of families used to go down to the airport to watch the planes. But in my family, we always went to the train station. And if there's one memory that stands out in my mind, it's, uh... It's being lifted up onto my father's shoulder to watch a long, long freight pass by. And waving to the engineer. And watching him wave back. (sighs) Thanks, Dad. Thanks for remembering. - [Man] Merry Christmas, everyone. - [Man] Merry Christmas. - One more Christmas tradition left for all of us. I thought Kathy and I might walk over to that beautiful piano, and... Will you join me, Kathy? And we'll sit down and sing some Christmas carols. I'm sure we can get even old Harold to join in. - I'm sure. - Now, I'm ready if you are. ("Chopsticks") - [Charlie] She hasn't wanted to play since her mother was teaching her. - Well, chalk one up for Father Christmas. - Yeah. If it hadn't been for you I'd have sent him away. But the father I'm seeing tonight is the one I always wanted to remember. - [Laurie] I'm glad. And the Charlie I see tonight, is different. - Could be the same fellow who's still got next week off. - The one who thought it'd be a good idea for us to get away? - Together? Alone? - Must be the one I'm in love with. - I love you. ♪ All is bright ♪ I need you. ♪ 'Round yon virgin ♪ - I'll stay, Charlie. - Stay? As in... - As in, I'm not taking the job in San Francisco.

You always knew how to pick the best. I guess I'm two up on you, huh? I wouldn't let you buy that tree- - You suckered me into playing Santa Claus. - Yeah. Well, tomorrow morning the kids and I'll drive you down to the train yard. - Thanks, but I, uh, I've ordered a cab. - Well, that figures, too. Mom and I would always meet your train, but the leaving was always up to you. - Charlie, tonight is goodnight and goodbye. - Both at once. - I wanna thank you and the kids and Laurie for a really wonderful Christmas. (solemn music) - [Charlie] Leaving is still up to you. That part hasn't changed. (solemn music) (Chance sighs) (train horn blowing) - Well, good morning, everyone. - [All] Hey. - Well, Carolina! Cajun. - Hey, looks like Christmas was real good to you this year, Chance. - Well, we missed you yesterday. - We were celebrating. We found work. - We're staying. We just came by to say goodbye. - Well, congratulations. Good luck to the both of you. - And to you. - Well, ready, boys? - [All] Yeah. - Now you take care. We'll see you next time we're through. - You bet. - All right. Take care. (train tooting) - Get your coats. - All right. (Kathy chuckles) - Best turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes and trimmings I had since I was knee high to my grandma. Them biscuits of yours were downright legendary, Slim. - What about the pies? - The piano player was the best I heard at Christmas. - Remember that one-armed preacher in Salinas last year. - The pies, damn it! - I'd compare the singing to a wild baby, wouldn't you, Chance? - Ah, yeah. - What about the pies? My pies? - [All] Pies? - I ain't gonna talk about those pies till you do us some singing. (all laughing) (tires screeching) (lively harmonica music) - Chance Grovner. Any of you guys seen Chance Grovner? (lively harmonica music) Come on, kids, let's go. (train horn blowing) - We're too late. There he is! Dad! Kathy! Granddad! (heartfelt music) Wait! Granddad! Granddad, wait up! - Last night was our goodbyes. - We don't want to say goodbye. We want you to stay. - A week ago you were out of my life. Then you came back. - [Harold] Chance. - Now you're leaving again. - Please stay with us. - Chance. - [Charlie] They really want you to stay. - I'm not used to staying in just one place! - You're just beginning to know your grandchildren. - Maybe I don't want to have kids around me all the time! - Maybe they'll get tired of you! - [Harold] California, Chance, it's time! - Charlie, you've got Laurie here, a new start, a new beginning. - I want you to stay. For a while. You could leave any time you want. - Chance! (train clatters) Chance! - No! Please, Granddad. (solemn music) - That morning in the cafe, you said I ran, and asked me why. I never really answered you. 'Cause you were right, Son. It was pride. Too much pride. 25 years of pride that kept me from you. I almost let it happen again. But not anymore. - I love you, Dad. - I love you, Son. (solemn music) I'm staying. - You've been away too long. 15 years, Chance. You and me, we are the road. - I'm gonna give it a try, they're my family, Harold. - You'll be right behind me. - There's plenty, I'm not running. - Right on to California! - Something to keep you warm on the road. You look after Omaha and Topeka and Slim. You see that they get work. (solemn music) - Let's go home. (heartfelt music) (train clattering) - [Chance] Grovner & Grovner Custom Furniture. How's that sound to you, Kathy? - [Kathy] I like it. (cheerful music)
