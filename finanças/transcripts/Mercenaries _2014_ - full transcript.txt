Quick, get down! Forward! Forward! Faster! What's happening out there? I have a message from America, Olodan Crakovic is attempting a coup. We must leave immediately. And my wife? Olav will take care of her and your son, President. We must leave immediately. What happens now? What should we do? Come on, we must get out of here. Up there! A very nice house, my friend. Put the guns down. Everything will be fine - just fine. Okay. We will give you our weapons, if you let us live and let us live in peace. Before you leave us, I want to convey a message from Crakovic, your Presidency is over. Burn their corpses. What happened? Bring the bastard - bury them under the dirt! We still have more to bury!

An angel to protect us. Take their guns! Let's bury them. Come in. A squad is missing. Taken down? Maybe. They were suppose to execute and bury the prisoners. They didn't report back. It does not seem like they defected. I can not afford to lose them. You'll find the men and return them immediately. And you burn every village down that you come through! Yes, Olodan. Radovic! And if you have them, bring them back. As a warning to all! Understood. Look into the camera. The video, Olodan. Go! Go! Keep walking! Go! Faster! Keep walking! Show me your hands. Show me your hands! I'm ready for you. Break down the door! Damn! Damn it! After him! Come on, hurry up! Olodan, he has been captured. Vladko! What, comrade? Why did not you shoot? I can't see through the smoke. Let's move! Forward! Move! We got one of them. I searched him, nothing on him. But here is his Russian weapon. Russia... There are many of you are here! Unite yourself with the others! Make it quick! You there! Get your men and follow the river. I want them bastards. Hunt them down! Make sure you slaughter them. Go! Is it bad, Dubro? I'll take the other side, give me cover fire! We're here! There. The hell with it. Why should I go there? keep driving! The buildings are still empty. We have to check. Let's go. Come on, Ivano! Vladko, go check it out! Which way? This way. The place was empty. The body is still warm. They can not be far away. Let's go. Stop! Down, take cover! Let's take our shot. Radovic. The group is on the run, seen along the river. Two of our men fired on them, but they fled into the woods. Figure out how many men we have, how many are there. And order them all to the river. Very well, comrade. You bastard! Lousy Pig! Faster! We can catch them! Yes? OK. They were seen at the river. Let's get there quick! Immediately! Come on, man! Calm down, buddy Ivano.
