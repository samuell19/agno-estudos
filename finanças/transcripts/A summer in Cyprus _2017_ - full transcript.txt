You look, there is the Freedom Monument! Is your phone on vibrate? I'll notice when he calls, okay? Just turn the speaker on. - Mom! - Yes? What is a one-night stand? That's when two people very briefly... Only one night? - Sometimes they know each other longer, but in this one night, they particularly like... So, if one makes sex only once? Yes. Totally. Only once sex, and you've conceived a child? - Yes. Bull's eye! You look great. Let's go? Yes, twelve years ago I looked differently. Aiven certainly did so, too. I look like him, right? Maybe a little. Moritz, I have no idea what kind of guy he is. OK? Well, a pretty cool guy. After all, he's my father. I just don't want you to be disappointed. - How so? Because of your taste in men? Put on your shoes. Do you have your water? When it is hot, you have to... Drink a lot, I know, Mom. Here are the same stores as at home. What did you think? I've somehow... imagined it more old-fashioned. But Cyprus is part of the EU, like Germany. And why are there no women sitting in the cafe? - Where? There on the right. This is a traditional coffee shop. But look, some are sitting there. What do they play? Looks like backgammon. Let's ask. - No, rather not. I think they don't want to talk now. Yes, hello, here's Tina. Why not, I thought we... We could later... Maybe tomorrow? Yes, okay, then you call. And? Your... Your father unfortunately got an important appointment. Come on, it's not so bad, huh? We make ourselves a nice day. Shall we go eat some ice cream? He stands us up now or what? We won't stand it, Mom? Basdekis textile export, that's it. Are you sure you want to go in there? We can also wait until tomorrow. Come on, maybe we go eat something and then we'll see, shall we? There! That's him. Or? Elyas! Elyas, yeah, I'm here now. Moritz! Eh, Pedro! Moritz! Where are you? That's gonna be my tavern. And up there I'll build a beautiful garden terrace. Come, I'll show you. How's going with Sinzig? You and your infinite stories. You of all people say that, brother! Sinzig makes my life a living hell. Don't take it so personally, Aiven. How can I not take it personally? Sinzig doesn't trust me. Look, he's German, they want numbers, facts. For this they pay well. I'm a cloth merchant. I understand cloth, but you can negotiate... Forget it, don't even think about it. Elyas, Papa didn't pay for your studies you can crawl away into this dump. Dump? That's an antique building. Moritz! Are you up there? Elyas, it's not too late. You don't know yet that... Ask but your wife. She negotiates better than us both together. Yes... Stella, I mean, she doesn't have an education. She also wants to focus on family as soon as we... As soon as what? Once we have children. Oh, don't worry. This will work out eventually. Moritz! Moritz! Crap! Moritz! What happened? - I'll get bandages. - Yes. Come here. Tina, what are you doing here? Come over. Is your brother the important reason why you let us wait? - No. You hide from your son? That's not true. I e-mailed you that we come to Cyprus. You've just written that you think about it! You responded you'd be pleased! In theory yes. And we are here in practice. I'm Moritz. Hi, Moritz. Aiven, pleasure. My pleasure. As I said, I don't have time now. Maybe next week or so. We can wait until Moritz has his driver's license. If you aren't keen on your son, just say so! Then Moritz knows, where he stands with you! You could have thought about that before we came here. - Mum! - Yes what? - Let him. Please. You have a son? How is that possible? I thought that somehow it just doesn't work with you. Maybe she's lying. No, no, did you see his eyes? She doesn't lie. Incredible. And Mum's pestering us for years about grandchildren, and you... Don't talk about the family! Since when do you know about that? Aiven! Since when do you know about that? She's written me right after... Elyas, I was willing to take responsibility, I even proposed to her. You did what? I don't believe it. You're such a Turk, man. Turk yourself. What happened then? She has broken off contact. At least she's not stupid. Does Stella know it? Are you crazy? She tears off my balls. Well, they are no good anyway. Although... If you need anything, let me know, okay? Stella? Yes, at once, yeah. My food is cold. Mezze should be that way. I find it delicious. I want a sausage. You can also eat that at home. But I want one now. What is it, huh? You shouldn't have bitten his head off. Maybe he was just surprised. We still don't know him. "The last divided capital." Is it like in Berlin? That was worse. You couldn't just walk from one side to the other as we do now. The cypresses could just reunite, too. They're called Cypriots. Yes, it's not that simple. In 1974 the Turkish army invaded the north and expelled the Greek population from there. And since then they argue, how they can be reconciled. Up ahead you already see the Turkish flag. - Yes. So, the Selimiye Mosque was built as a cathedral. And when the Ottomans conquered Cyprus, it has been converted to a mos... Moritz! Sweetheart. The tavern isn't about profit it's about tradition. It is a Cypriot tavern with Greek, Turkish and Persian cuisine. Elyas, go to the bank. You know that the bank doesn't give me more money. I've got a loan, a mortgage. What about a rich Russians? Aiven! I have a right to my share of the company! You won't put any money from the company in there! - I want my share! - And? Stella! Sinzig's plane has landed earlier. He will be here any moment. Elyas! Are you homesick for your desk? It befits you more. Hello, Basdekis textile exports? Aiven? Here is Tina. I want to talk again. It was not a good start yesterday. - Is that Sinzig? - No no. - Yes? Hello? - Here is Tina! I don't understand. Hello? - Aiven? - No. We don't want a water dispenser, no! - Aiven! - Yes, thank you. Gosh! Who was that? Oh, some sales rep. We want to go? Don't you want to come along? You will make it. Mr. Sinzig! Welcome! Good day. - Would you like to have a coffee? - Yes. Let it, Mama. I think he really doesn't want to meet me. Tina? Hello. Here's Elyas, Aiven's brother. Could we meet, perhaps? But you said you can do that. And we can. By October you have your goods. In October, we put the seats into the vehicles, Mr. Basdekis! We need the materials much earlier. My producers do their best. In addition, they recommended colleagues who... - wait, wait! The manufacturers recommend their competition? In Cyprus there are good connections among textile manufacturers. During the crisis we learned to help each other. In Germany, we don't need any favors, we are planning our orders. - We can achieve better quality with more manufacturers. In addition, we protect ourselves with it. Yes. Now let's first take a look at the sample, right? Here we have a new shade of gray. Discreet and elegant. Currently still a sleeper, but has the makings of a fashionable color. Or? Looks good, yes. If he isn't here in five minutes, we'll go. - Why isn't he my father? - Hi! Why aren't you a girl, huh? That's very sexy about you to pick us up. - Mum! What? - Now that I know that I have a nephew, I want to meet him. In addition, we are a hospitable people. Well, maybe all except my brother. Come! Get in. Where are we going? Small tour of Nicosia. The Omeriye mosque is the only active mosque, that still exist in southern Nicosia. I thought, there are hardly any Turkish residents in the south. Such as me. You are a Turk? Not quite. But my mom. So Aiven is half Turkish? Then I'm... - Well? - A quarter Turk. Not correct. A Cypriot. Just like me. The differences are overestimated. So, your mother is a Turk, and your father is a Greek Cypriot? They married three years before the division. A Greek tragedy. Do your parents live here? No. After my brother and I took over the firm, they moved to their family home in Paphos. Is it far from here? Two to three hours. It is a wonderful route. Especially if you drive through the mountains. Well, unfortunately we don't have a car. - I'll go back there anyway. My mother celebrates her 70th birthday in four days. You are welcome. Is Aiven there? Yeah, right. The whole family. Mom, please! Your parents don't know about us, right? We say that you are friends of mine. Cool. Do we also get false name? We don't pose as someone else, so it is convenient for Aiven. Not for Aiven, for my father. He had a heart attack in the spring, he shouldn't get upset. He won't get upset if we don't come. We don't run behind Aiven. I think he was excited eventually. Yes. And reassured with the samples that I showed him. - You were great. Stella, has your doctor called? Yes. And? Negative. Perhaps it's not meant to be, Aiven. Maybe it's better if we focus on the company. We do want this child more than anything in the world, right? You want this child more than anything else. I want respect. But I respect you! Your mother was equal CEO. I'm doing the same tasks as she. Only until Elyas comes back. He won't come back. When will you finally understand this? But if you think you'll fare better on your own then eat alone, too! - And sleep alone. - Stella. And you can go alone to your parents. Stella! What should we do, huh? Shall we go to the mountains? Oh Mama, why so early? I would have loved to sleep. Would you rather go to the sea? Paphos, that would be cool. Elyas! Has anyone here ordered a taxi to Paphos? You've kidded me, right? We really drive to Paphos? I thought you were too tired, huh? Come on, jump in. Come in. I'll get the stuff. What's the song actually about? In our songs it's mostly about unrequited love. About longing for a person you can't have. Sounds exhausting. It is indeed. Or? Why are you so good at German? I studied business administration in Hamburg. Even worked there for a while. Has Aiven studied abroad, too? No, he did an apprentice- ship as a draper. In order to marry quickly. Oh, Aiven is married? Yes, for over ten years. For girls from traditional Orthodox families that's sometimes - the only way to... - Well, yeah. In order to make sex? Has Aiven children? Apart from you? No. Do you hear this? What's this? Oh, shit. Such a crap. Oh no. Moritz! Pour water over the shirt and put this on your neck. Otherwise you get a heat stroke here. - Oh, Mama! Now! Should I call the breakdown service? - Yes, do that. Shit, I have no reception. Can you please? Unfortunately I have no phone. What? Wanted to test whether I can without one. Maybe the gas is out. Gamoto! You're right! I've forgotten that the fuel gauge hangs sometimes. Well done. I'd say, no problem. We simply wait until a car comes. Come sit down there. Oh no... Why do you say thank you so friendly? We waited for him for three hours. You're on vacation, relax. Why do you Germans think that the world has to be perfect like you? I pay, then we go on, okay? No way! We are on the way for four hours in the blazing heat, you need a break. - I'm fine. - No! I only get in if you eat and have done a power nap. A what? A power nap. It's mocha for us. Mum! Is that Aphrodite's Rock? Exactly, kid. And we'll take a look at it. Whoa! That's cool here. - Moritz! - I mean sexy. The legend says that Aphrodite has risen from sea there. If lovers swim around it three times at full moon, then the love lasts forever. For real? It didn't work for me. You swam around it? - With Aiven? - Yes. Wow! Pretty romantic. Isn't that a sport for tourists in love? Well. It somehow worked for you, right? Gosh. When I post this, the others are surely full of envy. Looks great, yes. Aiven's architect once called it a building for the next generation. Can yoi do me a favor? Please don't mention the tavern. My parents don't know about it. Even more secrets! No secrets, I'm waiting for the right moment. Welcome! Anne! Elyas! That is mum on Turkish. Anne! Elyas! Elyas. May I introduce you: This is my friend Tina. And her son Moritz. - Hallo! - Kalos irthate! Kali sas méra! Kali sas méra, to agori! Hello. Your girlfriend? Yes. Welcome to our home. Thanks a lot. Come, I'll show you your room. And that's our room. Oh, we now sleep in one room? You're now my girlfriend. Or? In my mother's house, unmarried couples don't share a bed. Voilà! This is your room. Come with me. - May I help you. - Thank you. See you later, okay? Elyas! Elyas! Why don't you say that you bring guests? You always say that a large house wants to have many guests. She's a friend. A friend, your girlfriend, what now? Does one bring a girlfriend to his parents' house? You have to be careful: A German on vacation is quickly gone with your heart. I'm 37 years, okay? Nevertheless you have a heart, a big heart. I actually wanted to invite Müge, the daughter of my friend Ebru. She is a Turkish woman and not married. Thank you, Anne, but you know... Now I need to uninvite her. Very embarrassing for me. Hi. The rooms are connected via the balcony. I know. TurkishGreek double standards. But don't worry, I'll stay on my side. Is there a nice tavern somewhere? I want to thank you by inviting you. What for? - For the ride. It means a lot to Moritz. And to you? I think it's a bit weird. Because of Aiven. Indeed. But above all, we creep into here and don't say who we are. That's not really my type. You do it for your son. But why only now? My ex-boyfriend has long been like a father to Moritz. Only when we broke up, he became interested in his real father. What happened? The classic. He cheated on me, had another one. The worst part was that I found it out myself. At least I now don't believe everything I'm told any more. Lunch's in half an hour. Aiven! Let's already sit. Aiven! Anne! Welcome, boy! Baba! And? All right? Where is Stella? She's sick. But she still looked very healthy yesterday. But nothing serious, don't worry. Maybe something good? Ojojojoj. Mind your own business, okay? How is the business going? Oh Papa. In order to handle the job with Sinzig we need to enlarge ourselves. I was always content with the Greek customers. Aiven, may I introduce you, this is my friend Tina and her son Moritz. I bring the salad, right? What about your manners? - Excuse me. Hi. - Hello. Aiven. Tina. Pleasant, Tina. And who are you? Moritz, hello. Hi, welcome. - Well, sit down. - Yes. Yes... - Water, brother? - No thanks. - Baba? - Thank you. Yes, please. Good Appetite. Mmm! Tastes good, huh? - Don't you like it? - Yes, yes. Come on! - I have already eaten something on the way. Do you cook at home yourself? Only on weekends. And during the week? Well, I'm a single parent and I still have my own business. So had I and two sons. You also had a housekeeper, Mama. Yes. What a business do you have? A second-hand shop for children's and baby stuff. Second... Hm! Old clothes for babies! This is normal for us. The things are mostly new after a child. Our family is in the textile trade for generations. When people buy old clothes, that's bad for business. Right, Elyas? Yes. Yes. Pretty hot day today. I'll go wet the lawn. I help you. And who will help me? I. I help. Are you crazy? Why are you doing this? Perhaps I'm sorry for the boy. Comes to Cyprus just to meet his father. And the guy is an asshole. And if Stella were here? If she really loves you, she accepts it. So a shop on your own and a child on your own... Well, that's all bad. Is Moritz's Baba dead? So many divorce today. We were never together. Then he let you down? No man of honour. Bad education. Yes, sometimes it's complicated. In Cyprus that wouldn't have happened. With me and loannis it was complicated, too. Although the Turks and the Greeks were good neighbors, but having a Greek admirer as a Turkish woman... It went a bit too far for my father. But... Ioannis was full of passion. He didn't give up until he has convinced my father. So they are - the men in Cyprus. Even today, okay? Yes, if it is love, it is still stronger than anything. What is this, Elyas? Want to blackmail me? If you don't bail for the tavern, Mom, Dad and Stella will learn everything. Ftánei pia! You won't dare doing that. You leave me no other choice. Hey! We have just talked about you. Perhaps we want to make a little trip? Oh yes. Only three of us? Yes, yes, just the three of us as a real men trip. - Oh yes. But tell your mother about it. Uhhuh. We meet at the car, okay? Good? You'll regret it, I swear. Our love was even stronger than the war. When the Turkish army invaded and my family went to the north, I stayed with loannis. I lost contact to my family. This has broken my mother's heart. But... I have never regretted my decision. Ioannis is a good man. A good father to my sons. Moritz also needs a Baba. Well, here he has two. Hey! Where are they going, man! Hey! Moritz! Moritz! Gosh! What form are you now? I come in the sixth. Aha. And what is your favorite subject? I don't know. - Sports? - Mine was history. I like it too. - And what are you doing right now? Romans. Then you should really visit our archaeological park. This is the pride of our Paphos, you know? Tell me, little one, can you play Tavli? - Backgammon? - Can you do it too? - Well... Will you teach it to me? I haven't played it for a long time. Just tell honestly that you play bad. Not everyone can be such a tactician like you. So what now? Elyas! If you cheat, I'll break your fingers! Turkish methods or what? Sure, with you always. Moritz, here's Mama. Call me back when you receive this, I want to know where you are. - Tina! Can you help me for a moment? I wanted to just... You can bend down better than I can. We need some fresh herbs for dinner. Not easy to let go of your child, right? Well, you also have to abide by certain agreements and this... He carries you in his heart. I know it from my sons. If you can let go, he comes back, again and again. That's what I'm saying! They keep coming back. Ah! Come on. Hops! Clear. Are you crazy? Just going without letting me know! And no one answers on his cell phone! I have no phone. On vibrate. Battery empty. Moritz, I was worried. Didn't you want your mother to be... - forgot it. If he is the son of a donkey, what are you then, huh? - Stay away from my son now. - Mum! One more action like this, and we leave. Don't be so angry now! I understand that you want to get to know your father, but there are still rules! - You're doing it, too! - I? You're lying to Fatma and Ioannis on all the time. That is something completely different. But you don't tell them about us. Yes, of course not. Because Aiven has to do this. So here are the rules, and I have to abide to them. Whether I like it or not. I don't just run away without letting you know. I'm sorry. It was only... I was afraid he would change his mind. You don't have to bend to please Aiven, huh? He can be so happy to have a son like you. He knows it. I go swimming. And as a punishment you help Fatma in the kitchen. - What? Come on! Wanna go a bit? Look, do you recognize that? Oh God! Was that here, okay? Yes. Exactly here. Say, Tina, why didn't you call any more? I was studying. In addition I had a life in Germany. When you called me and said, will you marry me, - I got scared. - How so? Yes, we hardly knew each other. And I didn't love you. Thanks to you too. Did you love me? Well, frankly, I was quite happy. When you called me back then, I had just met Stella. And all because of a bit of fun and a night at sea. I knew we shouldn't have swum around this rock. But. It was not always easy, but I'm very glad that Moritz exists. Me too. Then show that too. That is the reason why we are here. He wants it so much. We aren't here to mess up your life. It an't get much worse. For years Stella and I are trying to have a child. It doesn't work. Therefore, you don't want her to know about your son. Yes. They come back. Together. Do you want them to see? - That you spy on them? - I don't. She is the girlfriend of Elyas and goes on evening walks with Aiven. Something is wrong with this woman. Let's go inside. Kalimera! Oh, this looks great. Oh yummy! Aiven, do you give me a piece of bread? - Sure, please. Kalimera! Don't look! Eat! Eat! That was actually for the celebration. Oh come on, Mom! Then we buy something new. Who cleans up the kitchen? Aiven of course. You are so funny. Oh, come on, Mom. Let's have breakfast. So. Moritz you can't eat all that. Let the boy. When he is hungry, he should eat. And, Moritz? Do we visit the Archaeological Park today? Yes! Well, if I may... Of course. When do we leave? We wanted to Lefkara... Well, the village of which I have told you. It's crazy, everything here is so close together. And nevertheless the landscape is always different. Just like its inhabitants. Isn't it sad that there can be no unity? - Of course. A bit of it is folklore. What would Cyprus be without the Cyprus dispute? Malta. It's just a stupid joke. But I think there's something to it. For centuries this here has been teeming with occupiers Romans, Ottomans, British. Mosques here, churches there. It is about time tha we simply live together. Come here, I want to show you something. This one - true craftsmanship. Did you also make something like this before? No, but my grandparents. These are the world-famous Lefkaritika. Already working on it for six months. Is the Cypriot textile dealer in you speaking? There are families in Lefkara, who sell their work in the whole world. It is said that even Leonardo da Vinci bought a cloth from Lefkara. For the Milan Cathedral. Why do the Germans always keep their water bottles with them on vacation? Because they aren't stupid. The body dehydrates easily at higher elevations with faster breathing. Drink something. From the same bottle? Isn't that risky? As is not drinking. I'll call Moritz. He certainly drinks... Don't worry so much. He's a great boy. - Do you think so? - Uh-huh. Such a thing is easy to say; you will also notice this when you have a child. For this you first need a woman. You actually don't seem hard to place. Maybe I'm too Turkish for the Greeks and too Greek for the Turks. Again a Greek tragedy. Did you know that in ancient Rome fathers were entitled to decide whether to accept paternity or not? How is that in Cyprus? In modern societies, the word of the mother is considered. Until rebuttal. Luckily. You would probably have said no, right? Why do think that? Why didn't you look for me? Or got in touch? Weren't you curious? Hmmm... Do you want an embellished answer or the truth? OK. I was of the opinion that we'd be better off without each other. - And? - What do you think? - Honestly? - Yes, of course, always. You are still on trial period. It must have been bad for you to live in Hamburg? Not at all. I even miss Hamburg. Really? Uh-huh. This is precisely the problem with traveling. You always take something home, and leave something else there. And this is what one will miss. I had a girlfriend in Hamburg. It was clear from the beginning that she wouldn't come to Cyprus. But I still had hope. Why didn't you stay? I wouldn't have done this to my father. Then love was not great enough, your mom would say. Right. There is something on that. The company was more important to me at that time. And now not anymore? The textile trade isn't the problem. Rather the customers. Always this begging, I'm tired. I'm on equal footing behind a counter. I like that more. Therefore you have the tavern now? Yes. Also, I like to cook. Aiven hopes that I come to my senses again. Hopefully not. The tavern is but something like your baby, right? Yes. Actually yes. Tina... If I could do what I want, then... Can't you do that? Aiven is my brother. We needn't swim around the rocks right now, do we? Boarded! Oh, be careful! Whoa! OK? Wow! You are learning quickly! OK. - Aiven! - Won! Stella! What are you doing here? Aren't you glad to see me? On the contrary, of course I'm happy. And who are you? This is Moritz, son of Tina, a friend of Elyas. - Elyas has a girlfriend? - Yes. - Hello Moritz! - Hello. Nice to meet you. And you play Tavli? Yes. And he can do that very well. Come over! Do you see? He can do that. - Moritz, you're hungry? - Yes. Then start already. Hi! Finally! - Sorry, there were some issues with the car. We want to eat. Elyas! Stella. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Stella, the wife of Aiven. Tina. Come, let's sit down. Then I have two assistants for tomorrow. Anne, you have three. - Good idea. - No need. Anne, you know very well... I don't want a mess in my kitchen. I don't need to join in. You stay, we women do it. Exactly. And we men go to the sea and talk about business. - Oh, Baba! - That isn't necessary. But me no buts! What should I tell Papa? Nothing at all. We get everything under control. I have found a merchant in Fethiye who can supply us with the fabrics. From Turkey to Cyprus? Good idea... - Of course not. I arrange for it to be delivered to Greece. From there, we will send the goods to Germany on. - And this works? It does in no time and is all legal. A girlfriend. So, so? What is he doing there? Is he now crazy? What's it gonna be? They are in love! In our parents' house! If Anne notices that! Aiven, honey, we are in 2017. Some things aren't proper here. We should have dared more earlier. Do you think so? Yes... If I had known how much fun it is, being married to you, I wouldn't have been able to wait. Aha. Do I get a kiss at last?! Or should I order it via Greece, too? So, how's it going with the Germans? How much did he order? Argotera, Papá! Argotera. Baba, but not in this weather! Come on, Elyas, let's go for a swim. My sons! Always on the run. - I stay here. - Yes, sit down. It is nice here. Is this from the war? No no. From my heart surgery last year. Can one operate at all with soo much hair? They have been shaved. But they have all grown back. I also have chest hair. Two. Elyas got his very late. Aiven - I think he had a beard at 14. Cool. Then I'll surely grow hair soon. Ti ipes? I mean, of course, hopefully mine will grow soon. Well, we need space to lay out the aubergine. They need time to rest. How many people come actually? Uh, it comes loannis' brother with his wife and son, coming all the way from London. And then four friends and cousins ​​from Limassol. And the former assistant of our company. That makes - er - no, I forgot Aiven's brother-in-law and his family. Anne, are you sure we shouldn't order a catering service? Stella, do you want to totally embarrass me? Also. What about my money? Elyas, this is about company capital. Even if I wanted to, it wouldn't be so easy. You know that. You could at least vouch for me. And if it goes wrong? Can you just trust me for once? Just once? But there isn't much reason lately, right? I know what's going on between you and Tina. And what is? Does she know something about your game? Want to threaten me? And if? I have nothing to lose. Are you sure? Avi, you don't have much time left. Either you support me, or Stella and our parents learn everything. OK? All right then. Good! As you wish, little brother! Yes! Kali orexi! This smells good. I had so much to do, Tina has made this one. Yes. Help yourselves! I'd like a piece. We have Salad, too. Mmm! Mmm! So, who wants Zivania? Raki? Or ouzo? - For me ouzo. - Zi-what? Zivania, a Cypriot specialty. I'll take that. - Many Thanks. - For me too. Before we lift the glasses, I've got something to say. You all know, we are a special family. We experience this every day on this beautiful island which requires us to know on which side we belong. For a long time I thought so, the most important thing in my life is my wife and the company. But now something crucial arrived on the scene. More than ever, I now know who and what I am. I'm a father. Stella. I knew it. Stella, Anne... Baba: Moritz is my son. That isn't true? Almost exactly twelve years ago Tina and I met on this island. In the summer before we got engaged. Yes that's true. I got pregnant and I've decided to keep the child. Stella, I'm sorry. I have made many mistakes. The worst was not telling you the truth. Moritz, I should nevertheless have welcomed you with open arms. I was very rude. I'm sorry. We have a grandson, loanni! I already thought that Elyas doesn't bring the two without a reason. He didn't, Father. He wanted to force me to my happiness. I know you had something else in mind. But still, now you can't blackmail me any more, Brother. What is he talking about? What a blackmail? You brought us here. You used us. Pack your suitcase, Moritz. We leave tomorrow morning. - Mum! - Please. Tina. Tina! Tina! Tina, wait! Plase! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I would have told you at some point. I wanted money... from my brother for the tavern. I used you for that. But I'm in love with you. Tina! I love you. I should have known. I should never have come. Tina! I, I can imagine what you're feeling. No you can't. Stella, I swear to you that was the only time. I endure all the treatments, the operation, the injections, the hormones! Do you realize that I've done this just for you? But you wanted a family, too. But not at any price, Aiven! For me, my life is fine the way it is. I'm also happy without children. - For real? - Yes. Because I love you. Because I want to live with you. But I want to work with you, too. Fortunately. I can't live without you either. I'm an idiot that I haven't seen it right away. I contacted the Turkish company that you have recommended to me. The one from Fethiye? Yes. I told them we would like to order. They report on Monday. To you. Ah, Stella... It's not far off, sweetheart, okay? Be careful. Tina. Come on, I'll give you a ride. You're welcome. Yes hello? What?! Okay, I'm right there. Father had a heart attack. Okay, we'll come with you. Elyas! Stella! Aiven! What's wrong with him? Brother, please wait! Elyas what's wrong with him? The doctor and Anne are with him. How is he? Can we see him? Aiven, this unfortunately won't work. He is weak, he needs rest. He must immediately be hospitalized. I've tried everything, he refuses. He can't stay at home after all. Ioannis won't go to the hospital. That's all my fault. He became upset because of me. Moritz, eh! That's not true at all. If it's someone's fault, then mine, okay? Now listen. I think he wasn't as happy as yesterday for a long time. Don't Cry, Don't Cry. Come here, sweetheart. Sinzig. Now... now I can't pick up. Here is Stella Basdekis. Yes. Of course our appointment still stands. I'm in the office this afternoon. Then we can discuss everything. OK. I have to go. Elyas. I'm sorry for having embarrassed you in front of Tina. I deserved it. We both haven't shown us at our best. You've at least told the truth. That was very brave of you. I go to my room. OK. What if Dad can't make it? Then I can't forgive myself. He will make it. Can you manage it with Tina? I don't know. Not even if you're a successful tavern owner? Elyas, I've been thinking. The company doesn't mean to you the same as to me. I won't be able to pay off your complete share. But part of it should be enough to rebuild the tavern. There isn't just one way to be happy. Find out what's yours. And don't let yourself be held back by anyone. Moritz! Come here! I want a word with you. Come here! Ioannis Pappou! What? Pappou! This means grandfather. He's fine, don't worry. You're not sick. Sit down please. Your Dad Aiven doesn't tell me for eleven years that I have a grandson. And your uncle Elyas thinks that I don't notice that he no longer works in the company for half a year, but wants to open tavern. They constantly lie. But they worry. If they are worried, they at least don't think about themselves for once. You're too hard on them. Moritz, tell him that he is too hard. Your Grandma is obviously mad at me. But she also wants her grandson to be here on her birthday. Not true, Fatma? Naturally. You do it because of me? For who else, darling? You have to tell them Pappou. I know. Baba! Your heart... you immediately need to lie down again! Pappou is healthy. Do you think I don't notice that you are no longer in the company for months? From a friend in Nicosia I know about your tavern. And you? You bring our only grandson here in the house, without introducing him? Baba, I really wanted to... And now you will ensure that we don't lose this wonderful boy. Thank you for coming back to us. I apologize for my sons. You can thank our grandchild, for me forgiving you. And finally we celebrate your mother's birthday. Celebrate? I can't do that any longer now. Anne, don't worry... I take care of it, okay? You? - Yes, and we tell all the relatives that you have cooked. You assist. Aiven, come on! Baba... Ah, that's your cousin Marius, from the brother-in-law of your first cousin. Hello. Hey! Marius! Moritz, this is Mandalena, the daughter of our doctor, the cousin of loannis' nephew. - This is my Anne. - Hello, Dimitra. Good play yesterday. What one doesn't do for the family. Come over! Moritz! Do you like the food? Moritz! Does it taste good? - Yes. Very good. Aiven will be pleased. Come on, Mr. Sinzig! Stella! Mr. Sinzig. What a surprise. - Is there a problem? - Yes. My boss has looked at the new patterns... And? He likes it very much. But... could you also produce twice the amount? What do you mean, Stella? We should manage. If my Stella says that, then we do it. Sit down, please! - These are lamb chops. - Yes. Stop and listen. Wait! Now, uh... On Mr. Sinzig! And! On my Stella! And - in particular: On our mother! Yamas! Yamas! I hope you can forgive me some day. Yes. Has already happened. I only can't trust you any longer. I've vowed not to make any more compromises. For that matter. A shooting star. There are quite a lot here around this time. - I know. Because the Earth crosses the Perseids. Actually, there are no stars, but dissolution products of a comet. With their high speed they are heated and then... they burn up. Your brother told me that back then. - That's not true. - Hm? I told you that. At that time, on the beach. At the party. Really? Mhm. Shortly after my brother came and picked you up. Well, I probably had too much ouzo. It was raki. Maybe you also had no interest in me. I was a bit shy. The invisible little brother of Aiven. Now you're certainly not invisible anymore. I see you very well and with great pleasure. So do I. Good night. I'm sorry, sweetheart. But I have to go back to the store. Otherwise the temp give all the good things to their friends. I know. I'll go ahead, right? Tina, can't you open a shop here in Cyprus? I thought old clothing is bad for business? The family is sacred. It is more important than business. Bye. And thanks for everything. Bye. I will miss you so much! You come back very soon? Do you promise? Bye. Many thanks for everything. The house will be empty without you. We will be back soon. Well, Moritz, this time we won't wait twelve years. And you have to visit us in Berlin. - Bye. Thank you. - Bye. That's all? My red suitcase is missing. Hhh! I've forgotten. My tablet is inside it. Should I go back and get him? What do you mean, Moritz? Shall he? Shall he? Listen. Just because I have to go back to work, you needn't come along. You've got holidays. Mama! I'll come back in three weeks and pick you up. Shall we? And you're sure you want to stay here alone? I go with Dad and Elyas to Nicosia and renovate the tavern. But only after I have beaten Pappou in Tavli. Very good. And you call me every night, right? - Yes. And if there's anything, I'll get you. - Yes. And when it's hot, I drink something. By the way I'm sorry that we have "taken you by surprise" like this. It's not the first time. I hope he will want to return at all. - Certainly. Moritz has the best mother one can imagine. Do you think so? Yes, he says so! Bye. Bye. Ah, yes, Moritz - come! I'll show you something. Quite brave of you to let the little one here. Not that he becomes a Cypriot macho. You're still there, right? Also, it's a bit self-serving. Then I can come back in three weeks and pick him up. I forgot something! Never lie to me again, okay? Promised. Even if you're family now. In three weeks. I'll be there.
