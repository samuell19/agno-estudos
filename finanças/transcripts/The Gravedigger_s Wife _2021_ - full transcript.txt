I have a story for you. A very good story. Have you heard the rat story? A group of rats held an emergency meeting about a cat. The cat had eaten other rats, so they discussed how to stop it. The wisest rat made a suggestion: Let's put a bell on its neck, so when we hear it coming, we all run away. They all agreed it was a good idea. But the stupidest of them had a question: Which one of you is going to take the job? Don't you get it? Who will put the bell on the cat's neck? It's obvious, the cat will eat... GRAVEDIGGER'S WIFE Stop it. Stop playing. Why are you so quiet? I am thinking. Thinking about what? Talk to me. I am thinking about going to the village. We used all our money for your medication. You know how I feel about you going to the village. Nothing good will come out of it. Alright boss, it was just a thought. I'll find other ways to get money. SHUKRI HOSPITAL Stop, stop. No gravediggers are needed. We have been here all day, and nobody's dying. I'm out of here, friends. See you. -What is this? -It's money. -This is nothing, give me more. -You didn't carry much for me. I'm not giving you more, bye. Mahad! You idiot! Look where you're going! Mahad, your father is here. Go home and do your homework. I already did it at school. Okay then, move. I'm talking to you, get up. Do you hear that? -The devil is paying us a visit tomorrow. - Which devil? Is there any other devil in this world than my mother-in-law? Sometimes I wish she just disappeared without a trace. I believe yours is an angel compared to mine. What has she done to you? Your mother-in-law at least visits you, mine can't even see me. She believes we disgraced the family. I believe she would have shot me if she could. Wait, I'll go breastfeed the baby. I'll be right back. I'm happy that you feel strong enough today. Where are you taking me? Where are we going? -You look handsome. Let's go. -But where are we going? -Do we know the wedding couple? -No, we don't. -Do we have invitation cards? -No. So we're crashing a random wedding? Just like old times. You can't go in without an invitation card, please leave. How are we going to get past the security guards? What are you doing? Why did you borrow the goat from the woman? Could you show me your invitations? Here. You didn't understand me. I asked you for your invitation. Are you blind? It's right here. This is not an invitation card, it's a goat. -Ah, all you see is just a goat? -Yes. Listen to me, you big muscled guys. We bought a pure-bred goat for the wedding couple. It cost us a lot of money. But it's a shame all you see is just a goat. Firdi, please call the mother of the bride! -This is outrageous! -You're right. Tell me your names, I will complain about you. Please calm down, ma'am. Come on in. Are they looking? -What do we do with the goat now? -Let it go. Her condition is getting worse. If the abscess in her kidney can't be stopped from growing, she will die. This is... a nightmare. I will see what I can do for her. I'll prescribe her a different type of antibiotics. It will hopefully stop the infection. If that doesn't help, you'll have to take her to Ethiopia for surgery. Nasra is a strong woman, so let's hope that doesn't happen. Thank you, doctor. Nothing is working. Do you remember our plan... ...to run our own business, put Mahad in one of the best schools in Djibouti... ...and then travel around in Africa? Yeah. We're going to achieve all that, inshallah. But I want you to promise me one thing. Promise me that we are going to stay strong. I know it's not going to be easy, but we can only get through this by staying strong. Are you hungry? I will cook something good. Ali, why do you give him more money than me? Because he worked harder than you. -What the hell? I worked hard too! -Hands off! Mahad, what's wrong? What's going on with you? I had a fight with Ali today. Come sit here. You haven't been to Koran school or regular school for two weeks. Why? -I'm talking to you! -Calm down. Don't shout at him. None of you know how to read or write, so leave me alone. -What's up? -I'm alright. You seem worried. What's going on? I'm stressed. I couldn't sleep last night. What's stressing you? I'm not sure whether I should buy a cow or a donkey. That's it? My friend, listen to me carefully. I'm forty-five years old. I hunt dead bodies for a living. I have a son I can't be an example for. My wife's health is getting worse. My family hates me the most in the world. With all those problems... I try to stay sane. -Sacdiy! -What are you doing? I will give you a real reason to stress about. Please, stop it. Listen... Hassan is interested in you but he's too shy to make a move on you. Could you sit here and ask him what he likes about you? He's joking, I mean no, it's true... Sure, give me a second. Look what you have done. I did my part, you do yours now. See you later. -Hi, Zahra. -Hi, Guled. -How is the family? -All is well. How is yours? Great, thanks to God. I have two kinds of news. Good news and bad news. The good news is that we have an anaesthetist visiting and the operation can be done here. The bad news is that you will have to pay for the operation. If the infected kidney is not removed, Nasra will not survive. The operation costs five thousand US dollars. Hello. What can I get for you? I'm looking for Ahmed. -What's your name? -Guled. Ahmed is not here. Ahmed, I can see you're there! -Please, I need your help. -Are you deaf? Ahmed is not here. I'd have helped you too, if you asked. Just go away. I don't have any money right now. I'm so sorry. Good night. -Have you seen Ali? -No. Ali! We're closed. Come back tomorrow. Are you deaf? I'm going to call the police. Go away! I don't want to hang out with you. Let's go! Hassan, what's up? You're all smiley. Things went very well with Sacdiya. Really? So well that she agreed to marry me. Congratulations! This is great. Great news. Thank you. See, it wasn't that difficult. It's all because of you. You know me, I'm shy. May God help you the way you helped me. Amen, my friend. Listen... This is from me and our friends. It's not much but it's all we could afford. Thank you. This means a lot to me. No problem. See you. Mahad! Your mother is dying. I don't have the money to save her. I'm going to the village to ask my family for help. Take care of your mother. I already asked Zahra to keep an eye on her. But you are her son. It'd mean the world to her if you were by her side. See you soon. I'll be back in a couple of days. Amhad, are you going to help me? What about you, Fuad? Which one of you is going to help? Ali! I'm glad you're here. Hello. I'd appreciate it if you gave me a shoe. Any kind of shoe. I have finished washing. Thank you. -Sir, can I wash the car? -No thanks. -For only 200 DF. -I don't want it. -Only 200 DF. -Go away. Look how dirty your car is. I clean it all. No, go away. -Okay, only for 100 DF. -Go somewhere else. Who is next? Are you all afraid? -You wanna play? -Yeah. It's 500 DF. Are you sure? You can't complain later. 500 DF. Cite Hodan! Are you going to Cite Hodan? -There are seats available! -Not going there. Uncle, there are seats available! -Is it going straight to Cite Hodan? -Yes! Cite Hodan! There are seats available! Cite Hodan, only a few seats left. Are you going to Cite Hodan? -Sir, the bus is almost full now. -Thanks. -You earned almost ten dollars today. -Yeah, it's really a lot. Your father will be proud of you when he comes back. I hope so. It is late, let's go now. Move away from the smoke. If I move, the pot will burn. Why are you going to the village? Stop asking questions. It's okay. I'm going to get my share of the herd to sell in Djibouti city. Your entire herd? What for? That was delicious, honey. Thank you. Tell me, have you found any cute girl you like? Mom, are you crazy? -I'm your mother, you can tell me. -I'm too young. Your father and I were only a few years older than you when we first met. How come you never told me how you two met? Because you're never around to sit and talk to me. Your father's family and mine were from different villages. But one summer, both families were camping in the same area. I disliked your father very much at first. Why? Because when the kids gathered around the campfire at evenings to chat and dance your father always stood in a corner, never talked and just stared at me. But one afternoon, I was at the lake by myself, crying my heart out, when your father came to me. Why was she crying? She found out that her father was giving her away in marriage to an older man she never met. Then what happened? He sat next to me and said "I love you". So, the first words you ever said to her were "I love you"? Why are you looking at me like that? I've told you hundreds of times that I love you. I told him about my father's intentions. Your father went quiet for a second and then made a suggestion. He suggested that we run away to the city together. So we left everything behind, got married and never went back. Is that why your families hate you? -Mom, can I ask you a question? -Yes, honey. How could you trust my father? Weren't you afraid that he could kill you? No, I just trusted him. Hello, mother. Bring me a glass of water, will you? -Is your son with you? -No, mother. What brought you here? -I came to get my share of the herd. -You left your herd. I left them to my brother. You just abandoned them. They're his now. How can my brother own my herd? You left them a long time ago. There's nothing for you here. Go back to where you came from. Mahad! Where are you? Mahad! Stop it! I'm here to claim my herd. -You abandoned your herd. -I did not. -Neglected and abandoned them. -I left them to you. -You deserted them. -I left them for you to take care of. Enough! I, as the head of this village, have the power to make the last decision. The village has strict rules. Anyone who tries to go against them will be punished accordingly. Watch out! That's the final decision. The trial is over, and the decision has been made. My wife is dying. Where is your father? He went to the village. Can you call him and tell him to come immediately? My father doesn't have a phone, and there are no phones in the village. How is my mother? Dr. Yasmin, do you have a minute? You know that's against the hospital policy. Her husband's coming back soon with the money. Then we wait. This woman can't wait, she could die any minute. I'm not doing this for free but you can do it at your own risk. Suit yourself. I have some money. Do you think it could help for the operation? That's sweet. What the... He went in that direction! There he is! The operation was successful. Nasra is safe. When your father returns, tell him to come to my office. -Hey, what are you doing there? -To see if my father is coming. -C'mon, everyone is waiting for you. -Go ahead, I'll join you soon.
