Bah! Humbug! Oh, hush! Confounded chimes! Wherever I go all I see is this clock staring back at me. No good in funerals. Marley wouldn't have approved himself. Waste of money! Waste of time! Hey, hey! Get off me! - - Oh! - - Get off! Get off me! All right, everyone out. Who are you? Head of the BBC. That was a Twix. Get out! All right. Plan B it is. Coats. Yes! Come on. What are you doing? You said I'd be taking over as Scrooge. No, I'm playing Scrooge, that's why I've got the nose. You're playing the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. He doesn't have any lines. The cast said they'd walk if you played Scrooge. What, the whole cast? I'm the leading actor. No, you're the worst actor in the company. Aww! Auntie Diana, you promised. Just hurry up. Well, you'll have to do it over the phone, then. Annie, Annie! What, what? I can't remember any of my lines. Again? It's the nerves. Come with me. What if you become ill? I won't! What if you get injured? I would have to be completely incapacitated to pull out now. Really? Get in there! Just stop, stop. Good evening, BBC viewers. Unfortunately, the cast of The Christmas Carol have all been taken ill. Just get off! It's my microphone, mine! But don't worry, the Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society happened to be passing by and will be filling in with special guest narrator, Sandra's aunt, Dame Diana Rigg. Please enjoy A Christmas Carol. Bah! Humbug! Hush, confounded chimes! Everywhere I go all I see is that damned clock. Everywhere I go. All I see is that damned clock staring back at me! Ah! No good in funerals anyhow. Marley wouldn't approve himself. Waste of money. Waste of time. Marley was dead to begin with. There was no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the solemn undertaker and of course, the only mourner, his partner, Mr. Scrooge. Auntie Diana, you're on, go. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge walked into his counting house. He was a tightfisted, hand on the grindstone, a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, covetous old sinner who was as hard as flint. The weather was biting. But cold and heat had little influence on Scrooge. No warms could warm him, no wintry weather could chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he. Stop it, stop it! Could you stop? Ow! There was not a man, woman, or child in London who chose to walk close to Scrooge in the street. Oh! Go, get off! But as long as he was able to go about his business with thrift and count his coins, what did Scrooge care? Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge. Merry Christmas, Uncle, God save you. Bah, humbug! Christmas, a humbug? Uncle, you don't mean that, I'm sure. I do, Frances. What's Christmas but another time to find yourself a year older and not an hour richer? Oh. Every idiot who goes about with merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stick of holly through his heart. Oh! Wipe that stupid smile from your face. I have every reason to smile, Uncle, and make merry at this time of year. What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough. What reason have you to be dismal? You're rich enough. What else can I be when I live in such a world of fools as this? Why is one a fool for wishing her uncle a merry Christmas? Because it does you no good. Does me no good? It is the one time in the long calendar of the year when men and women can open their shut up hearts freely and hold out their hands to those below them as their true companions. Fine speech, Frances, you belong in Parliament. Christmas, Uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold in my pocket, has done me good and will do me good And I say God bless it. Miss Frances! What a pleasure it is to see you. Well, merry Christmas, Bob Cratchit. A merry Christmas to you, too. We hear a knock at the door. Oh, a knock at the door! Oh, that must be the lovely couple raising money for the orphanage. What merry bold and charitable souls they are. Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley? Mr. Marley died seven years ago this very day. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. We're raising money for the orphanage to care for the sickly and make provision for the poor, like young Jane here. On the shelf, Bugsworth. Yes, Mr. Scrooge. Ah, Merry Christmas, Miss Frances. And to you. Ah, let me help you Mr. Scrooge. Oh, no! He's completely incapacitated. Don't worry, I'll step in. I'm fine! Humbug. Get out, Bugsworth! What shall I put you down for, Mr. Scrooge? Nothing. You wish to be anonymous? I wish to be left alone and keep my money. What would you want for the needy? That they should die and decrease the surplus population! I have not much in my coin purse. Fear not, Mr. Cratchit, you are poorer than most. But what little I have you are welcome to. I'm afraid there is only a single penny I have saved. You would part with your only coin? Yes. Do you not need it for your family? No. Oh, thank you, Mr. Cratchit. You'd give all you have to charity. No. No? You don't want to give to charity? Yes. Are you sure? No. You have to make a choice. Make a choice, will you give them the coin? Yes. Thank you! This bag was made in China. God bless you, Jane. May the generosity of the goodly people of London town keep you merry this Christmas. Uh, merry Christmas, Miss Frances. Merry Christmas, Mr. Cratchit. And to you. Don't be cross, Uncle, say you'll come and dine with us tomorrow. No, Frances, I shall spend Christmas alone. Kindly keep Christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine. Keep it? But you don't keep it! Let me leave it alone, then. Very well, Uncle, if you change your mind you have our address. Merry Christmas. Sorry. Can we just, look... Okay, Jane. And my coat, and my coat. Just, don't look, Bob, don't look. Okay, all right. Let's get on me coat. Okay. Open it. Open the door, open the door. Jane, open the door. And a merry Christmas to you, Bob Cratchit. You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose. If it's quite convenient, sir. It's not convenient, Bob Cratchit. Christmas comes but once a year. Look outside at the people going about their business with glee. This is not a time for money but for family and mine would appreciate me home, sir. Spare me your foolish humbug, Cratchit. I... I uh... I, I... I, I, uh, I... I am not a rich man. If I can spend Christmas with my family, I would be content to gnaw... upon a bone or sleep on a bed of warts. Fine, Cratchit, take the whole day. Uoy sselb. Bless you. Thank you. Humbug! But be here all the earlier the next morning! Wang! Jacob Marley? Scroo... Scrooge! Humbug. Scrooge, shaken by the vision, went to search the rooms of his house for signs of an intruder. Finding nothing untoward, he returned to his bedroom, secure in the knowledge the house was completely empty, other than Scrooge. I'll get it. Scrooge! Who's there? Ebenezer Scrooge! Humbug! What trickery is this? Who are you? In life, I was your partner, Jacob Marley. You don't believe in me? I do not. Why do you doubt your senses? Because a little thing effects them. You may be an undigested bit of beef! A blot of mustard. There's more of gravy than the grave about you. Proceed, dreadful apparition! Why do you trouble me? If a spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. I am doomed to wander through the world and witness what I cannot share. I wear the chain I forged in life. I made it link by link and yard by yard. You must listen! My time is nearly gone. Oh, how I wish I could cast off these cursed chains! I am made captive by my deeds. But like me, Scrooge, you have girded yourself a great chain, which in time shall hang heavy around you. Stay away, vile spirit! I wish to see no more of you. Unlock the door. Begone! Undo the bottom one. You will be haunted by three spirits. Without their visits, you cannot hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first when the bell tolls one. Farewell, Scrooge. Scrooge. Scrooge was left alone again. He looked out through his window, which was locked shut, undisturbed, just as it was before the ghost arrived. Resolved to forget what he'd experienced, Scrooge went to bed and blew out the light. Are you the spirit whose coming was foretold to me? I am. Who and what are you? Come close and I shall tell you. I am the Ghost of Christmas Past. I shine with the light of a thousand Christmases gone. I have never seen your like before. May I look closer? No, no, no, no, no! It's, oh, oh! By my light you shall see the truth of your past. Take me in your hand, Scrooge. Your past is hidden beyond these walls. Step through with me. I am mortal, spirit, I cannot. By my light you shall. Humbug, ah! This way, Mr. Scrooge. Oh! And with that, Scrooge and the spirit disappeared from his bedroom. Take me through, I don't have arms. Alright, just go. Tip me. Tip me, tip me! You're not moving, just... Wait. Have we disappeared? Yes, shh. Scrooge found himself soaring over open fields and woodland. Oh, unnatural spirit, will we not fall? We shall not, Mr. Scrooge. Where are you taking me? My light shall show you the man you once were. Welcome to Greenscreen 1-2-3, where with just one click, you can be on a beach or at the Eiffel Tower. Overlay your own exciting footage. Yeah, I think Robert would make a great leading actor. Oh, come on. It's Ebenezer Scrooge, not Ebenezer Huge. Ow! Ow! Ah! Robert! Stop! Stop it, ow! Stop it! This is becoming... Don't! Get off! Get off! Bloody get off! Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no, he's completely incapacitated. No, I'm not! Humbug! I'm fine! I want to be in a grownup relationship. I don't want to be dating Max anymore. When are you gonna do it? After we finish Christmas Carol. Yeah. Good heavens, I know this place. I grew up here. This is where Belle and I would court. And there we are. I'm sorry, Ebenezer. We cannot be together any longer. Why, my love? Another idol has displaced me that you love more. Who is this idol you speak of? There is no one else. The pursuit of wealth and gain engrosses you. I don't understand. You have grown hard and unfeeling. Like your partner, Mr. Marley. Please, don't leave me. Our contract is an old one, made when we were both poor. I can change. You are changed. When it was made, you were a different man. I release you with a heart full of love for the man you once were. Goodbye, my dearest. Good... Goodbye, my dearest. Oh, spirit, why do you delight in torturing me? Dry your tears, Ebenezer, you must to bed before the other spirits arrive. Oh, no. Sorry, mate, sorry. And just as Jacob Marley said, upon the stroke of two, Scrooge heard the merry sound of laughter. Ho, ho, ho. Hello, Scrooge. Who are you, spirit? I am the Ghost of Christmas Present. I am cheer, I am joy, I am Christmas. Come and know me better, man. Oh, spirit, I have seen enough for one night. I cannot bear another heartbreak. I beg you, leave me be. Haunt me no longer. Humbug. Haunt me no longer. No, me! Get off! Help me out. Me, me! Worry not, Scrooge. Your journey with me shall not be one of heartbreak, but of mirth. Now, come, you look hungry. What is all this? Why, 'tis the bounty of Christmas. Ho, ho, ho! I don't believe you have merely come to feed me. Tell me, spirit, the purpose of your visit. Each year you have shunned the present, but this year you will mark the lessons it holds. Very well. Conduct me where you will. If you have aught to teach me, I shall listen and profit by it. Then follow me to the street, Scrooge. Show me something I may smile upon. Jacobi! Ho, ho, ho! All gone now, he's completely incapaci- oh, for God's sake. Right, come on, Jacobi. Uh, come down to the street, Scrooge, and see how the goodly people celebrate Christmas. A day where all mankind can forget their position and go about with glee and good tidings. Masters and servants, judges and scoundrels, landlords and lodgers, can all make merry together and wish each other well. Do you recognize this house, Scrooge? Aye, it is Bob Cratchit's house for sure. Here comes his youngest, Tiny Tim, walking home. Ah, Tiny Tim, the sweetest, dearest boy that there ever was. Ho, ho, ho! Come, Scrooge, look through the window and observe how these humble folk live. I've had the children clean up before we eat. What'll we be having for Christmas dinner, Bob? Bob? A goose. Oh, Bob, you saved up for it, how wonderful. Anything for you, my sweet. A drop to drink? Oh, why thank you. How was Tiny Tim at church? As good as gold and better. He told me coming home he hoped people saw him because he was a cripple and it might be pleasant for them to remember on Christmas day who made lame beggars walk and blind men see. Enough wine for you, my dear? Plenty. I pray for him every day. Here he comes now. Hello, Mama. Tim, come here, my little boy. Lift me in your arms, Papa. Whee. Oh, Tim, you do look frail of late. I am frail. Frail and ill. Achoo. Uoy sselb. Sit up to the table, my little Tim. Oh, Mama. Now let us raise a glass to Mr. Scrooge, the founder of the... feast. The founder of the feast, indeed. That hard, unfeeling scoundrel is the cause of our suffering. Mr. Scrooge has not the kind family I have. I pity him. Mm. Alone on Christmas day. We may be poor, but we are rich in company. Eat, Father. Oof! - There is a wealth Mr. - Scrooge may never know. To Mr. Scrooge. The founder of the feast. God bless us... God bless us, everyone. A remarkable boy. Tell me, spirit, if Tiny Tim will live. I see a vacant seat and a crutch without an owner. Do I really pay Bob so poorly? They have such a meager feast. What a fine family they are. Tiny Tim is such a brave boy. Mrs. Cratchit such a loyal and devoted woman. But they should get on with dying and decrease the surplus population, should they not? What more can you afford to pay? I don't only care about myself, do I? Come, there is more to see. Do you recognize this house, Scrooge? It belongs to my niece, Frances. There she is now. Oh, uh... Oh, dear. It looks like they've got the decorators in. I'm sure they'll be done any moment now. And there we are, they're done. Is it a vegetable? Not a vegetable, no. Mineral, then? Not a mineral, which leaves you with? Animal. Quite so. Alive? More or less. Oh, my dear Frances, why must you always be so cryptic? Is this animal disagreeable or friendly? Oh, disagreeable for sure. Does it growl? Sometimes. Is it found in England? It's found in London, Topper. A horse. No, but it says nay more than a horse does. Is it a pig? Is it a fox? Is this animal domesticated? Hardly. Frances, I know what it is. A disagreeable creature, but none of these? It is your uncle, Ebenezer Scrooge. It is, it is! Oh, bravo, Topper. Oh. A disagreeable creature, is that what they think? And a growling one. But what does Scrooge care what these fools believe? I don't care. Indeed. More or less dead, hardly domesticated. What childish blabber. I care perhaps a little. The time has come for me to away and let in another spirit before Christmas day. I'm all right, it's all right. I'm so sorry. No, it's all right, you're fine. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, mate, sorry! Come on! Come on! Are you the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come? Sandra. I've got good news. That agent just called. He's going to take me on. He said the exposure from Christmas Carol will easily get me that advert. I'll never have to work with this bunch of freaks again. Aww! I don't suppose anyone will attend the old goat's funeral. He never gave a penny to charity. He stole from the poor. Selfish. Spirit. Show me some tenderness connected with the death or this dark conversation will be forever present to me. Oh, my poor Tim. Be at peace, my dear, sweet boy. Why would you have put him in the coffin? Well, how else am I supposed to keep him contained? Oh. Oh, come on! Yes, he died a week ago, I heard. Good lord, I thought he'd never die. Well, I certainly shan't miss him. Nor I. He was very unpopular. Spirit. Are these the shadows of things that will be or are they the shadow of things that may only be? Oh! Spirit! A man may change the course of his life. Spirit, I... Spirit, I am sorry. I have been greedy and selfish. I have served myself before others and shut out the gift of their kindnesses. I am sorry to everyone. All of you. I've taken you all for granted. I thought I wanted to go it alone, but... Truth is I'd be lost without you. In fact, I believe I am not feeling at all well. I think I may be completely incapacitated. Scrooge. What? I'm completely incapacitated, Mr. Scrooge. Chris, I don't know what to say. I couldn't. You have to. We are all counting on our lead actor. Chris, it's your part and you should finish it. I'm not gonna take your role. Well, why don't we do it together? No, I'll do it. Humbug! Quickly, we have to finish the thing. Here we are, come on, quickly. Hurry up! That's it, this way. Up to the bedroom, come on, quickly. Hurry up, there's still time. We can still make it work, come on, quickly! Scrooge fell before the spirit and woke to find himself in bed. Good morning! I shall live in the past, present, and the future. The spirits of all three shall strive within me. You there, child, what day is it? It's Christmas day! Christmas day, oh, Jacob Marley be praised! Wait there, for I must speak with you a moment. I shall have that girl run to the poulterers and fetch the plumpest bird she can find in the shop. Merry Christmas everyone! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, sir! - Merry Christmas. - - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to one and all! Merry... Excuse me, are you playing Scrooge? No. Chris is playing Scrooge. I am not playing Scrooge. You took over as Scrooge. I only took over as Scrooge because you forced me to take over as Scrooge. I did not force you to take over as Scrooge. If anything, you forced me to play Scrooge by being such a bad actor. Nobody forced either of you to play Scrooge! You came here and took Scrooge from me. By force! Stop fighting, look, it doesn't matter who's playing Scrooge. That's what we've learnt tonight. It's not what I've learned tonight. I've learned that it absolutely matters! I am Scrooge! Get them out. No, no, no, no. Come on, it's over. No, get, get off! They're using force! They're using force! No no! Chris, understudy! I'm Scrooge! Quick, the cameras! Get off him! Get off him, Jacobi! Which way? Aww! We'll finish this outside! Everyone outside! Okay, go, go! All right, quickly, they're behind us. All right, all right, all right, we're still filming, so action. Uh, here's a better idea. Why don't we all go to the poulterer's and fetch a goose?
