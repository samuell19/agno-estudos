Subtitle by Vagman Maybe memory is sand. Shifted pure. Or maybe it's a footprint. Maybe into the future. Kyrie... ♪Kyrie Eleison ♪ Gloria... ♪Gloria ♪ I wanna go swimming. You have to swim in the nude. I'm not swimming in the nude! I swim... You will! So what? What does it matter? We did not really know each other. Not the way we know each other now. We were all English speaking students at the International School. In Rome. Background: Woman's voice. Confusion is a mist. It sprays over rock and sand. It slips through me. It knocks at my shield. Still... I must go on. Maybe a journey... is a glimpse into your own eyes. To see sure. A collage of new faces. A dream... ...is a watchtower. Wow... It is cold! Come on! If I had a brain in my head, I had go home. But then... What's at home? Here I have the ocean. And freedom. But something is missing. It's like a race. You know you have to win. But you always think, you're gonna loose. Am I an actor now? Is this is our stage? To really be both actor and audience? All of us were wondering why we answered that ad. And what the play was all about. It really did seem as if someone was watching us. Some thought it was that priest. You can feel someone is watching. Well... something is watching. I'm watching. We are all watching. We are just more aware. Every time I look at myself, I burst out laughing. Werewolf. What are they? They howl. They don't exist. There are things we don't know about. Hey... Food! Mitch always thought he was better than the rest of us. Maybe because he had a motorbike, and none of us did. Once I asked him what he thought life was all about. He just said: 'Boring, plain boring. And dangerous.' and entering while adding his donuts. Then I asked Jack. He took up a long silence, and slowly said: 'Life is a meadow. A torture chamber. A density. A longitude. We're here to evolve into the greatness of ourselves, so that we become the energy of God.' Maybe it is time to be rich like butches. He would have more attention. I remember him inquire the only mouth he words. Yet, he had a beautiful voice. Blessen my child. I got small teeth. Give me some more! You're the smallest person. It's not fair. Look at Bubba. He got much more and he is not bigger than me. Oh, shut up. Mister Ambassador. Have you got anything to report? No comment. Anything? No comment. But Sir! There must be. No comment. But Sir! For me, there is nothing more complex than simplicity. And life is simple. In the Mist of Beauty... There is Decay. And in Decay, there is often Beauty. Jack... Tell who was De Gaulle? Johnny Dollar, the leader of France. De Gaulle, boys. Not the goal. Anyway, he was president. President...? Jack.... Don't you remember anything? It's not my fault. You never teach us anything. Aaahhh... But that is the mistake so many people make. You can't expect me to teach you. No one is ever taught. Once and only learn. Although I must admit. Teaching is a temptation few teachers may be able to resist. I remember the geology class. We were studying the components of rocks. I could not remember the names enlabled for them. So I stay out. But I could describe them better than anyone else. I like studying rocks out here. Maybe I am just obstinent. I like my way best. I wonder if I lived out here long enough, I ran off for forest. And if scientist want to experiment on me. Babba was the youngest, and never questioned much. Greg... mmmm... He seems to probe things I don't even know the questions to. Max was a loner. And I did not know him that well. He seems to care only about himself. But he is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. I never heard him complain. In the worst situation, he has always something funny to say. David was changing. He was proud of his new house. He had good right to be. Anyway. It gets cold out here. The night is hardest for all of us. But when the sun shines through, we seem to forget our fears and home-sickness. There is something peculiar and scary about that man. I've seen him in every kind of man and occupation. He represents all of them. And he is many of them. I am not sure who or what he is. He is like a universal man. Mmmm. I wonder how he looked when he played Fairyn. I wonder what he was thinking. Beside... All come to see the play? Are we the only one? There must be someone with... Time waste the mailman. But you are only boys. So I expect you to be forgiven. I presume you come for the play. Poor Jack. You never were a good scolar. Well.... Never mind. Do you know him? Of course. Don't you? Should we? Not in the least. Just because you all went to the same school means nothing. Oooh.. That's one hell of a bitch school. That's an international school. You know what? Do we know him? Don't you want to know where to go? Where do we go? Basis is quite irrelevant. Only your existence matters. But I suppose you must show some of the grace to the audience. Audience? What aucience? You are the aucience. You have eyes and ears to see and hear, have not you? But we are the actors! Ooh... these pettiness sanctions again. How is that, child? Listen! There is no such thing as an audience. In this play, we are all actors. Only some are more obvious than others. Now be off with you, before I get angry. Where to? Where to? Boy... Don't you ever read your instructions? Good for you. Here. Come on you guys. So... we're here on our runaway. Our orphans from the Institution. I could have sworn I saw him as a military policeman. About to drive off us somewhere we know. Other times... I imagined him as a politician. Sometimes, I could swear his heart was gold. Where do you provided with? Each other! Is not sense enough? Already you are learning. Already you are acting differently from before. Because the landscape is different, and the people are different. You need to act in order to discover yourself. But here, you may act in a way that will follow even you. Just because I may seem old to you. Remember this. Have you ever considered, how at a specific point in the evolution, there may have be an old mammal talking to a young dinosaur? Now! Act! ♪Boys are calling for each other♪ Come on you guys! The only thing we can do is directly climbing above. Hey! What's that? It's a boat. Come on! It's a boat! Come on! Where is it? Right down there. It's time we go under and drag it from the bottom. For ashore. It's coming out. Come on. We almost have it out. Get the water out. Turn it over. Turn it over. Come on. For shut there. There it goes. Over now. Just do the tore off. By that high watermark. Hey... We have a leak. Oh, oh. There is a leak in it. Shit. I'm gonna go fishing. You don't catch anything. Then how else we'll get food? Buy it. I got money. Let's go back to the village and buy it. I have not get any money. You can always eat your own shit. Travis too. They eat their own droppings when time is over. There is no way. No washing up. What will happen if we don't eat? Starve, or we eat each other. How else do we'll get food? ♪Conversation in Italian♪ Who's going in? I'm going in. No, you're not. Are you afraid? Let me! Allright. Don't then. Butch... You stay outside to take the food. Come on. ♪Conversation in Italian ♪ Why? Why? At least he could told us. It was not fair. It was a joke. It goes far better that we could ever have. Some joke. I'm sorry. If we agree on a plan, we should keep it. Find another fitt-in. We're all in this together. Are we? They wanted to get us caught. What about the food? But no rewards. We're forgetting something. Why we came? I came for myself. That's why we came unprepared. That's what it meant. I came prepared. You are the most unprepared. We are not playing at Robinson Crusoe. We don't play. We're acting. I need to ensure something to drink. Sure... Pasteurised and sterilised. How do you know? It was written on the cow. Why not? You do last night. So...? That's something you're asking like... cigarettes. You're just a pig! Come and get a ????, Mike. You can't get away from...... before you start dating another. It's a ......, it's a shelter. What would you doing then? Using your hide. Everything changes. What is smooth becomes sharp. What's found becomes lost. At least... That's how I felt when we started arguing. Boredom. Hunger. And home sickness was are enemy. And we really did not know what to do. I was wondering if the play was about to begin. Or... or what was about the come next. What's the first thing you gonna do when you get home? Eat. I need the whole world. We'll have to go back. We'll have to get jobs someday. I nearly ???? a chick I can find. Why? What you got to proof, Bud? Oohh... she's gone. I'm homesick. I'm homesick for times I never know. It's only a car. You got to crack the ignition of it. What's the problem? How do we start it? Why don't you use the key? Home is like my subconscious diary. It remembers what I forget. And I forget what I remember. ♪On background, quarrel between man and woman.♪ David could not understand why his parents stayed together. Peter said: 'Lots of people stay together which shouldn't. They just stay because they are scared to leave.' Peter had it known. He had so many girlfriends. ♪Talks Italian♪ Which means: You're very pretty. I like your light. Help! Help! Help! Scaring. Scary. It was a goat. You scream like a girl! I was scared. We were all scared. We did not run away. Fear is something you have to... Overcome. That's too easy. The worst... You have to live with. Anyway... What's the van doing here? Does there have to be a reason? Of course there does. Oooh... Forget it. And what about God? And religion? Is God within me or outside me? Or is He there at all? Did someone make him up when you were scared? Or... Did God made us up? I'm not sure how to reach Him. Does sitting in a cue on a sunday mean unholy? Does laughing and burning crosses mean I am ? ? I think, maybe I am confused. And would like to think a ship without drowning my crew. I feel as if that priest is watching me. Let's get rid of it. Burn it! Come on! You're just like everybody else. If you can't understand something yet... you have to destroy it. Maybe man is only an speck on the coin of a star. Or is he the focus of the Universe? He ships to the moon. But he also ships himself. You guys don't know what you missed. It was... like a ritual. Rituals are necessary for primitive people, I suppose. I can't understand you guys anymore. Does that mean you wanna burn us too? Oooh, fuck off! There is no fun with you guys around. I am not staying with this creep. Any naked? You can stay here and learn around naked in the sun if you want to. But I think it's obscene. As man saying, so he is. Aren't you going home? I am home.
