Some time for a garbage strike. Everybody crazy to stock up. They decide to score at the last minute and they want it now. Never fails. The faces look alike. You gotta use memory tricks, each has some peculiarity, it keeps you sharp. A DD told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. I started writing after that. Not every night, now and then. Fill up one book, throw it out, start another. - Ah darling! - Ann. So have we made New York safe for another weekend? Robert. Get a job. Sad what 10 years without sex can do. Got any hundreds? Twenties. And some tens. - Tens? - Goddamn cash machines! Did what's-his-name give you a hard time? No. CBD. Fucking investment bankers! Cash Before Delivery. These Wall Street kids, they play with fake money all day. To them cash is like some kind of theoretical concept, it doesn't apply. I mean, we seen it too, right? Nine o'clock, I shudder to think, they are buying and selling. It has turned me off of the stock market. Tell me about it. I've thought of investing many times but it's just too damn crooked. These people. It's late. I gotta crash. Or try, anyway. You stayin'? It's over. It's okay? Yeah, sure. You do look like you're coming down with something. Take some C's, go on. I'll take care of anything that comes in. Thanks. Sleep tight. Pick up the trash. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. See you tomorrow. Big kiss. Labor Day. Union Movement. There's a contradiction in terms. I know about long hours. It's worse when I'm off, I just walk and walk. There's an element of providence to it all, like rolling numbers. Luck. You're walking down the street, some guy that looks maybe a little like you does a stick-up four hours ago. A cop pulls you in cause he's cold and wants to go inside. They grab your stash. Your number's up, you're busted for nothing, for bad luck. I like your jacket. Thanks, man. I got it in a trade. Is that it? Are they faced? Don't bore me. Is it so much work to face them the same direction? You don't do it, I got to, it's time. You're too much. We've been through this. This 19 gramme shit is a drag. We pay you more, you put up with more. White drugs for white people. Twice the price, twice the safety. I can't believe Ann's been working as long as she has. Never busted, she's something. Never made any big money either. Sure. She blows it. You believe that? What you gonna do after she quits? How long you been with her? She's always saying that. We'll see, Jealous. She's out. You should pick up her trade, man. You're too old to be a gofer. No way, I'm not the management type. If I take charge, I'll start using again. It's not for me. I know some music people. I'm gonna get into recording. Yeah. Tour? Yeah? Normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled. Why? Don't you read the papers, man? The Park murder, it's all over the Post. Mariah Rangel, nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch dead in Turtle Pond. She was coked to the fucking gills. All of a sudden they're hot after mid-level dealers. You know her? Who knows? Thanks for the warning. Jack? You pick up from Jealous? Yeah, had to make four trips last night. We're certainly not his favourite people. We don't make the laws. 19 is carrying, 20 is dealing. Let him be stupid. He took my hundreds. Take over for me a while, I'm getting contact high. PP? Yeah, seven three. So who's her majesty talking to? The ecstasy connection, from Arizona. She's trying to get them to come here, or better, Europe. That's where the money is. All mark up, could be the big one, Jack. Don't dress. You really think she means it this time? That's what she says. New Year's Eve, she had her chart done, New Year's Eve, and out. No acid house, no product, no delivery. That's just her mouth talking. Next year, strictly Akasha. Akasha? Cosmetics, that's what she's calling the company now. I don't get it. Why would anyone want to pay to put weeds on their face. Why'd anyone pay to put them up their nose? Robert, you got a point there. I like cosmetics. I need cosmetics. You should come in with us. You forget, she hasn't asked me. Johnny, Robert, get your butts in here! Plant two big kisses on me, boys. 1500 X, thirty each and the delivery is here. How do you like it? That's great. No, I mean the face cream. Marigold, chamomile, almond, aloe, egg, I remixed it, Almik, you like it? Yeah. Which reminds me, if you get downtown go to Enhancements, get me some almond oil but the California. Okay. Okay, what do we have to eat? Thai, we haven't had Thai in a while. We had it Saturday. Thai, thai, thai, thai, thai, thai. I want to start with meat crumbs. Oh shit, will you answer that? He's gonna call back every five minutes. The night begins. Curry, podtack, the bouillabaisse is awfully good. Or ped srilom, it's duck covered with plum and ginger sauce. I'm gonna go veggie, get me the puk ob. Robert? What? Do you want puk ob? You can use it for facial cream. Remove unsightly hair. Laugh, laugh, very funny. You're gonna be watching me on Oprah from a welfare hotel. Forgive us. Eddie wants now. Now, his place, top lady. God knows what happened to his shit yesterday. You take it. I thought it was supposed to be light tonight. Don't you watch TV? No, I don't have one. You don't? Well if you had a TV, you'd know it is supposed to rain. Good for the trees. Some farmer whacked his numerology on us. Yep, it's starting. Rain. The Farmer's Almanack is based on numerology. Take a jacket. Yeah, okay. You'd better clean up the product. LeTour, finally. What took you so long? Traffic, it's raining. How's things? Okay. I need a quarter, you got it? Robert sold you a quarter yesterday. That was an eighth, and some friends came over. How much is that? 1400, right? Hey, you want to buy this? Eddie, sit down. Sit down. I've known you how long, like eight years? I knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up. I knew your wife. She was great. We used to sit around and talk and talk. You didn't know what she was like. Eddie, this is no good. You gotta cool this. Go to bed, sleep it off. I'll sell you a gramme and some downs, but I'm not gonna put you in the emergency room. You charge 200 bucks for what goes for 90 on the street, and you're not gonna sell? So go out on the street. I'll call Ann. Go ahead, the phone's right over there. You know what she'll say. I'll tell the fucking cops. Fuck you, that's it. Hey I'm sorry. I was kidding, I'm sorry. Don't call again. I didn't mean that. You were right, I'm quitting anyway. I'll take the gramme, I'm sorry. You gonna cool this? Go to bed, sleep it off? You got downs? 200. Where was 1? Al right so, if there is no God, then how can we conceive of him? II mean the idea of God presupposes the existence of God. That's the Ontological Argument, that's Anselm. 1200, 1400, I'm not sure. I've got to go. Don't, LeTour, stay stay, this is the good part. So if the idea of God is implanted by God, the sensus divinitatus, the sense of the divine, you know? Then what is the role of human thought? Not faith, thought. Everybody wants to talk. It's like a compulsion. My philosophy is, you got nothing to say, don't say it. They figure you can tell a DD anything, things they would never tell anyone else. Of course they're stoned to start. Do you think that all of our thoughts are on a prerecorded tape and planted in our brain at birth, then they just play? I do. Carlos, pull over at the far left corner. Can you see the woman with the umbrella, in the trenchcoat? You got it. Marianne! Marianne? Hop in, I'll give you ride. John? Hop in. Get in, you're getting soaked. - Hi. - Where are you going? I didn't know you still lived here. Maybe it's, I should get out. No no, don't be crazy, it's pouring. I'm not supposed to be around-- Former drug associates? It's four years, I'm clean. There's no drugs, no alcohol, nothing. 1 heard, I'm happy for you. It's still not easy. I know, Mare, you don't have to avoid me. I'm straight. Yeah, two years now. It just came that time. I tried to tell you. I wrote, I called. I should get out. Honest? You're dealing. No, I stopped. What's in the bag? Almond oil. Go ahead, check. Oh shit. Oh, what's that for? In case anybody needs almond oil in the middle of the night? I deal a little bit. I'm straight, that part's true, believe me. Stop the car. - No, look-- - Right now, stop it. I won't say anything more, I promise. I'll just sit here, I'll just give you a ride. This is fine right over here.

You're anxious. More than usual. Your livelihood is in danger. You're worried about the future. You don't have much money saved. I see a woman who has betrayed you. My mother? Will betray you. I don't think so. You may be right. I have a strong feeling about this woman, a woman close to you. She will betray you. You're in the entertainment business aren't you? Yeah. But you're not happy there, you want to do something else. Is it, it's music isn't it? Still drinking, aren't you? Yeah. Do you have a drinking problem? No, I don't think so.

See you next week. Bye. Jealous said something about a yuppie murder in the park. You know anything about it? Sure, it's on the five o'clock news. He just said to be careful. Well, we are careful. We're too small time. She's not one of ours, not directly. Tis is at Saint Luke's. What? What happened? It's no big deal, he's just there in the waiting room, and he wants one of us over there right away. But can't it wait until he gets home? He's at Saint Luke's, I'd do it. Take it, will you? We have to stay on his good side, he set up Arizona. Okay. Okay, so second floor waiting room. You want to leave first. - Sure. - Okay. Johnny? You want to have lunch with me tomorrow? Me? Yes, one o'clock, Cote Basque. Too early for you? No. I'll be there. You're here. 1 had a little trouble finding the place. Thanks for coming. I came as fast as I could. So what's going on? You got some valiums? Yeah, and 'ludes. Just a valium, a ten. What is it? You won't believe it. What a nightmare. I brought in this chick. She OD-ed man, I didn't even know her. I didn't have to bring her in. The cops are coming back to talk to me. I'm hyper, I gotta calm down. This would never happen in Zurich. Here. Make it two. Thanks. She okay? Who? The girl. Yeah, yeah. Met her last night, a walking vacuum cleaner. What a nightmare. Underage. You need a lawyer? He's here. Thanks. Any time. Randi? Oh my God. John. I can't believe it. Marianne's here too. She flew in. What are you doing here? Is there a problem? Mom, Mom, she's back in. You didn't know? Serious? More chemo. Can ll see her? She's sleeping. She sleeps most of the time. She'd like it though John, she still talks about you. I'm so sorry. Your Mom's a terrific woman. I was always crazy about her. Hi! It's John. What a coincidence. Yes. Hi. Randi told me about your mother. I'm so sorry. Thanks. She sedated? Yes. You know, she'd be so happy to see John, don't you think? I'd like that. No, I don't think that's a good idea. You both look tired. One of us has to always be here. Yeah, the hospital lets us stay in her room. Could I buy you a cup of coffee or something? We could go downstairs to the cafeteria. Oh, you go Marianne, it's my turn with Mom. Oh no, I don't think I should. Yeah you should, go. Okay? And black? Yeah. Kiss your mother for me. You know it's gonna happen someday. But when it does. Your mother, that was a shock. Has she been sick long? A year. What about your father? Not this time, his new wife. He'll make it to the funeral. What have you been doing? Where do you live? It's been, I don't want you to know about my life. Anything? You married? You got kids? A dog? House plants? Nothing? Details just open the door. Open the door to what? It's not like we're strangers, after all. We were married. We were not. There was a ceremony. He wasn't even a minister. He was an astrologer! He was also a minister, The Church of Universal Harmony. He was a Pisces. You're a Pisces! It was not legal. In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're married. 1 was born on the cusp. We were happy. We were miserable. We were either scoring or coming down, mostly coming down. No, we had good times. Area. Out on the street, dancing with friends. We were magical. You took off for three months without telling me and called once. That's how magical we were. You were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies. Every one. I mean, nobody could clear a room like you, John. And the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours. I envy you. A convenient memory is a gift from God. You exaggerate. In rehab it's called euphoric recall, you only remember the highs, never the lows. We were happy. I was drowning. It wasn't me. - You watched. - You jumped. You did nothing. I wasn't your business, not your responsibility. You still think like that. No. Actions have consequences. So do inactions. I meant well. You always meant well. We were in love. We were happy. You bought it for me. It's inscribed inside. Ann's quitting, I've gotta find something else to do. I'll believe it when I see it. No, it's true. Are you really straight? Yes. Let me see your eyes. Eyes are deceiving. Congratulations. If I could do that, I could do anything. What does that mean? We could do anything. We could start all over again. I have to get back. You didn't touch your salad. John.

The rent, Con Ed, phone, CD's, tips, just clothes, regular stuff. How about your money? Kitty Ford once said to me, Ann, the only person I know who lives better than you is my grandmother. I don't know. All the money I make, all the money I spend. It just never adds up. And then the last two years this cosmetics thing has taken everything. 1 wish I could help. You still going to meetings? No, but I'm okay. Ann, what are the odds of meeting someone that you haven't seen in years twice in two days? If it's indicated in your house of relationships, it's pretty high. You should have Robert do your chart for you. Who is the person? Just a contact, you don't know him. So what's the plan? The plan? The future. My future? Why, is that too conceptual for you? Ann, we had this conversation two years ago. We're gonna have it again in two years. No, this time it is for real. Well, I'm thinking about taking some music courses, sound editing, mixing. Didn't you already do that? No, that was acting. No, that was modeling. Yeah, you're right, I guess it was. You should try these berries, they're flown in from someplace. Everything's flown in from someplace. Ann, is there something you want to say? What's up? I guess I'm a little worried. Everybody thinks I'm so tough. And you gotta be tough, especially in this business. It's one thing to look tough, it's another thing to. I've seen Zipporah twice this week. Did she help you? Yeah, she harmonizes and she, she's encouraging me to shift from, you know, to the cosmetics thing. But if it doesn't work, is she gonna pay for these berries? Montrachet? It is a cash world! Maybe, I mean I know what I'm gonna do. Maybe you should see Zipporah. No, I'm not into that stuff. What stuff? He's a big producer. Nominated for an Academy Award, Best Picture. I used to know every girl he fucked. Who, how. I mean, he couldn't take a shit. We were like this. His wife told him to get straight, or else she'd cut him off, old money. I remember the last thing he said to me. We'll keep in touch. Right, that was five years ago. Thanks. You'll still talk to me won't you? You? Yeah. Of course I will. Just think, it's gonna be so weird without you around. It kinda just hit me. We'll always have Paris. Johnny. Ann, you want me, just call. Write a letter, tell a wino, I'll be there. I'm sorry. I always thought my father would die first. He would die, and then my mother and I could reconcile. Like a joke. It's not a real feeling. My old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded. I miss you. You tried to kill me. You took 10 years off my life, one way or another. I couldn't hate my mother, I was too busy hating you. 1 thought I was just Killing myself. Selfish. Excuse me. Excuse me! Excuse us. Let's go. Come with me. Have you ever had sex totally straight? Not with you. That's quite an erection. I never had anything like it stoned. It's weird. I'm dripping. Let's disappear. You gotta go back? This is the end. It was wonderful, and I'm glad it happened this way. It will never happen again. You will not call me. You will not see me again. I'm happy for you. I wish you the best. I'm leaving. I shouldn't have left the hospital, but I don't regret it. Please get dressed and leave as soon as you can. I have a key, bye. Marianne. It's my fault. 1 love you. Johnny, what is this? Your beeper broke? You getting Shiatsu? Two hours, where the fuck have you been? There was a mix-up. How the hell are you gonna survive on your own? The UN has some conference in two days. The holiday is over. Peacemakers all over the place trying to score, UN security at every fucking hotel. Even I have been out, okay? Look, this is where our business is, Europe, Asia, not the fucking streets. But you wouldn't know crack from Cracker Jacks. Where's Robert? He's out busting his ass doing your job. It was a confusion. Well, get confused on your day off. And when is that? Don't get wise with me! What do you want me to do? Suck your dick? Okay, fine. You want a raise? Forget it! John, come here. Here are the call-ins. Get your ass out of here before I kick it. I'm sorry. LeTour! See, take a rest. You know Thomas. This is Gabri. Tasha. And I don't know who he is. How did it work out? What? Saint Luke's. No problem. But can you believe this? She's out of the hospital one day, calls me up, wants to get together. Some people are just born for losing. You want to go in the back? Not now, look at the bar. Dark-haired guy, late twenties, brown suit. He's casing you. Undercover, whatever, he's on you. Have you been a bad boy? Fucking Nazis! You know him? Just a feeling. Forget it, it wasn't for me anyway. Make it tomorrow. A half, no no, three quarters. 19 is the top. I can make two trips. 19 is fine. Okay, I don't mind. Take care girls. Ciao. I feel my life turning. All it needed was a direction. You drift from day to day, years go by. Then a change comes. I am able to change. I can be a good person.

Who the fuck gives a shit about you? I could grind you right here. In fact, maybe I will. What do you think about that? Nobody would give a flying fuck. I look like narcotics to you asshole? I'm homicide, investigating the murder in the park. 1 don't read the papers. Oh well, downtown is interested how a 19-year-old Barnard honor student with fancy parents, got a quarter of uncut coke on her when she's found murdered. This ain't the type of girl we find cruising Alphabet City looking to score. You know what I'm saying? Somebody sold her. Somebody upscale, somebody classy. You're classy. So I hear. And maybe somebody knows something we need to know. Understand? Delivery boy. Here's my card. You ask around, take a week or so. Call me. Tell me something I don't already know. It's either that, leave town, or get your ass busted day in, day out. Got it? Loser. Paramount Hotel. Marianne Jost? Just a moment. I'm sorry, Miss Jost checked out this morning.

She wasn't there when mother passed, died. She blames herself. It wouldn't have made any difference. She just slipped away. Marianne's, I'm worried about her. What do you give a shit about? God. Okay. It's. Don't try. How are you? Me? Yeah, you. I can't think of anything, but if there's anything I can do. I'm okay. We've been expecting it. It'll hit me later. I saw her. Who? Your mother. I came into the room, you were sleeping. Oh. Well, I gotta get back because Marianne's probably flipping out. Sweetheart! Shu Mai just delivered. It's fabulous! Have a little snack with us. No, thanks. I told Ann you'd be on time. Tis called, he said before 10. He said you were right. About what? Undercover cop, not a narc. The Park murder. Jealous was straight on that. You hear anything more about it? Remember the time that cop called here? Wanted to know if we had nose candy? And Ann says, Ann says, John Candy? John Candy. What's wrong, Baby? You look like shit, something's wrong. No, no, it's nothing. You can't fool me, I can read you. There's nothing to say. You're leaving me. After a few more months, Sayonara! You too. John, John who? What the hell was his name? It's not exactly like I got a pension plan. That's not fair, is that what you think? Look, you hate cosmetics! I know. And who even knows what's gonna happen? 1 got a friend, a DD. Got into lapidary, I'll introduce you. What the hell is he talking about? Gems, you know, crystals, diamonds. Anything more about the Park murder? What is it with this? Stay away! Look, if you want to come in with us, fine. We can make room, right? It's no big deal, there's room. It's not what I want. Well, that's what I said. This is Ed, you gotta come. Damn it. Don't answer it. Just let him call all day. It's all right. I don't want to deal with it. - I'll handle it. - I'm sorry. If he gives you any shit, fuck him! No, forget it. Don't forget about Tis. Ann needs that contact. Give it a rest. Eddie. You scum! Fuck you! You low life dealer! Personally, I don't give a shit. You can go kill yourself, I don't care. But you OD in here, it's a problem for me, you understand? I put a hex on you, man! Oh fuck you! Fuck you! What are you doing? Gotta get permission?

Always takes the time to grind it. If you're going to do it, do it right. Looks like you could use some help. Mari, this is Tour. You got any hundreds? Not the talkative type. Haven't seen her for years. You know her, don't you? Why they call me? What a nightmare. You want it or not? Yeah. See you later? Tell Ann I made that phone call for her, it's all set up. Marianne? Where to? What? Where to, sir? Where are we going? Nowhere just yet. Let's just wait. You want to wait here? Downtown. Yes, sir. All news, all the time. This is 1010 WINS. You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world. Here's what's happening. The dragnet is still out for those seven people who allegedly made off with $600,000 from the city program, that was supposed to renovate old buildings. It's charged the money renovated their bank accounts instead. More arrest warrants may be issued. And this just in, a woman has fallen to her death. Police are withholding identification, pending the notification of next of kin. The incident happened about 10 p.m. According to the sources on the scene, there was no one else in the exclusive Grace Towers apartment when the fall occurred. Is the sanitation strike over? The mayor says the successful conclusion of the negotiations is imminent. Who is it? It's John, John LeTour. Can I see you? What time is it? It's important, Teresa. You should call, make an appointment. Open the door. You're up anyway. Teresa please. Do I know you? We had a session last week. What do you see? - John. - Look at me. What do you see? Okay, just a minute. I see death. Someone I know died tonight. This was not an accident. This person was murdered. Am I in danger? There's danger around you, it's very close. God, I'm tired. What should I do? I don't know, I can't see it. Please. Is this it? Has my luck run out? No. No, you're fine. Don't be afraid. Come on, go home. What do I owe you? Nothing, forget it. You're fine. Ninth precinct. Bill Guidone, homicide. Hold on. Guidone. This is John LeTour, remember me? Yeah, laundromat. Your father's got big connections. You told me ask around, tell you something you didn't know. It ain't much, but it's something. Go on. A girl died last night, Lexington Avenue. Yeah, the jumper, druggie. The news said she was alone in the apartment when she went out, but she wasn't. It's a cover-up. There was someone else there. Who? Who owns the apartment? You there? That's all I know.

Did you go to the police station? She was back on drugs. Really back. They're gonna bring her here, foo. I thought she was playing for attention. I didn't know. You're not to blame. You're not responsible. Look. Recognise anyone? That's Tis. You know him? His father's a lawyer. He did some taxes for Mom. He was at the hospital. What is that smell? It's me, cologne. I'm a sucker for that cheap airplane stuff. Did she mention him yesterday? It was his apartment, what are you doing? I don't know. She jumped. I know you loved her but, I know this is gonna sound terrible, but she was, she ruined everything. Bad luck. Sorry about last night. Our prodigal son. Something came up, TCTE. TC what? Too Complicated To Explain. I gotta show you this. I'm 400 short from last night. You can take it out of my pay. Look, this is family. Are you saying that to hurt my feelings? It's not money. We had a graphic artist make it up. You know Billy, Five Towns. Oh, sure. Classy, very Katmandu. Kath-mandu. Whatever. Well, it's good, I like it, It's nice. Tis called twice. He wants you to come by. I don't want to go. The suicide and all, I think we should stay away. Can't, he's the connect. I don't wanna fuck with this. Oh, come on. Johnny, it's business. Let Robert go. Tis doesn't deal with fags. Since when? Since always, he just is, so he's a bigot. So what? So's everybody. I don't want to go. I got a bad vibe. He said you. Why? You go, he's your contact. He is. You giving orders? No, Missy. Come with me. The two of us. Sure. Why not? For old time's sake, Ann and Johnny. Stop it. You're breaking my heart. Robert, call the car. It's gonna be so strange not doing this. I mean I've had it, I'm fed up. You're really gonna do it? You're really gonna quit? I think so. I'll seal this thing with Tis, turn it over and put everything into cosmetics. You gotta take chances in life. No risk, no gain, as they say. And anyway, I've got my retail connections, here and in Europe. It was great when we started out, though, wasn't it? Greene Street years. Yeah, before deliveries. When you were still using. I should write a book. Did I tell you somebody asked actually to write my story? A ghostwriter. But, my lawyer freaked I even took the meeting. Of course it was impossible. Everybody thinks I've got such a glamorous life, but they don't know. I mean, you know. Glamorous, yeah. Well it was actually, once, before crack came and fucked everything. I gotta stop at my place for a second. Why? It's completely out of the way, they're expecting you. 1 got a bad vibe about Tis. Chill on this, will you? It is routine. I wanna get my lucky jacket. Oh, okay. That took you long enough. What'd you do, douche while you were at it? Ann, you got some mouth on you. You don't want to know where it's been. What is that, you have cologne on? It smells like that stuff they give you on an airplane. It's for you. You shouldn't use it, it's got chemicals in it. It's terrible for your skin. What are you doing? Do me a favour. What? Don't ask why, promise? Promise? What? If anything should happen to me, write her and tell her. She's my sister. Her husband's in San Quentin. She worries. Okay. 1 thought we were going to Tis'. We are, he's here. You can't very well expect him to be at his apartment after what happened yesterday. ♪ All our eyes have seen [ ♪ All our arms embrace ♪ ♪ All comes crashing down ♪ ♪ All comes face to face ♪ ♪ The beast is at the door ♪ ♪ The book is open wide ♪ ♪ Now to seal my fate ♪ ♪ Now to step inside ♪ Mathis Bruge, please.

Come on, let's get the fuck out of here. Hold it. Stop right there. No. Sorry about the guns. What the fuck are you doing this macho shit for? They were for emphasis. I was just trying to make a point. My fuck up. I apologise. Assholes. Really? What a nightmare. We'll take care of that thing tomorrow, same terms. Sorry. Go on, leave, you're upset. I just need to talk to Tour a sec, about the police matter, right. Tour and I need to get our stories straight. Somebody's talking to the police. I'm sorry, Ann. I just have to talk to Tis. Go down and I'll meet you at the car. We came together, we're leaving together, come on. Thomas. Don't be stupid. Get out, leave. I had nothing to do with Marianne. She jumped.

Stop now. Stop, please. Tour, believe me. I didn't have anything to do with-- Teal. Jones. And LeTour. Hi. We got 20 minutes. You look terrific. 1 look respectable. So what's the news? Sentencing's supposed to be in 10 days, and because of circumstances and our cooperation, they say it won't be more than five years, maybe seven. It hasn't been so bad. It's a relief in a way, so far. I've been writing, and reading. 1 love your letters. Good. I didn't know you could write like that. How's business? Is it still Akasha? It's still Akasha. Robert quit. He went back to dealing. I guess he thought he was gonna make more money and work less. So it's lucky the way I got mixed up in the investigation and everything, because now I really have to go through with it. It's cosmetics after all. Did we ever fuck? What? You know, make love? There was that Christmas party. Everybody got so stoned and-- No. You came over and crashed at my place once and we slept together. We were naked? But? We tried. I was thinking about it and I realised we never really did. It's one of the things I think about. One of the things I look forward to. I've been looking forward. Me, too.
