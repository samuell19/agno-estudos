I saw a room it pleased me a lot. It is very modern, natural wood. Exactly what I like. - Which room? - The apartment. You will have to wait. Now we have no money. But we have to mobilh? it. I have already informed me, they facilitate the payment. I studied everything very well. With my salary and a help his father or Ms. Donzert ... Her mother has paid the apartment. My father, the chariots. All we end up sinking. It's out of the question! We will sleep on the floor, it does not hurt. No, we do not sleep on the floor. We will bring our mattress here and all the rest. First of all, Stop crying like that. You look like my mother. It's out of the question, I sleep in that rotten mattress. That smells like sweat. It seems a burial coffin. - You are talking nonsense. - No, I'm not! And I could help me to pack. I'm sick of doing all alone in this house. Forgive me. Daniel, I'm sorry. Kiss Me.

No more crazy, little girl. - Thank you sir. - Thanks for receiving me. - See you later. - See you later. Spent in the warehouse, I bought a wine for you, a pastel and a bread. This guy came out I wanted my liver. - It means something? - I'll help. That's not the issue. Why are you working so late? I got another job outside the Institute. I got customers at home. It was tempting win a little more. Come earn your kiss. Wait, I need to set the table. Take this. Long time no see. Know C?cile and Jacques - Are getting married? - Same? Go. He works in something ... At a power plant plastic material. It is in Germany, or something like this. And I became good at bridge. You saw Stalin? It began maneuvers. Yeah I know. We talk about it at the Institute. What do you think of these pillows? They are cute, right? As I was saying, I'm very good at bridge. And Ms. Denise took me the house of some people and they want me back. They have an apartment on the Champs-?lys?es. A beautiful apartment. It has paintings on the walls. Magnificent. It seems worth a fortune. But it's not playing bridge who will pay it. I forgot to tell. I received an increase. Ms. Denise gave a raise. Formidable. Did not stop you from asking Mrs. Donzert money to pay the stove. And how do you know that? By C?cile, idiot. She called me, his mother had to pawn the gold chain from her. Cecile asked me to repay it, before Mr. George noticing. I can not anymore borrow money to my father. If this continues, it will work agricultural consultant, all leave me alone and it will be great. It pains me, because if I could create the pink Marjoline Donelle, you have everything you want. Because only want one thing. Make you happy. Disgusts me being fighting for simple objects. You're turning slave of them. I lost my hunger. Let's sleep. - well you understood the question? -.

He said, "Vendome in Spain." And without hesitation, you have heard. And now, I owe you, the end of the issue ... This meeting has something supernatural. We need romantic girls, that's all. It needs to tell her. Prevent it. Than? I have nothing against This boy. What about him so worrisome? The passion she has for him it is not normal. What do we know it for sure? He was heroic resistance, all right, but then they say that Bernard, that Nazi collaborator, I would have seen ... To me, this seems too exaggerated. If Marjoline is passionate by him, does not mean that he It has the same passion for it. That story makes me crazy. Anyway ... It's my fault, that's for sure. Once they started working, they do not have stepped over the church and neither do we. I respect their religion, but do not ask me to change my habits on Sundays. - Is not that, but ... - Where is your star? Is not that, but ... no Mass ... I feel guilty. I come from a family workers. So understand that my daughters They want to get ahead. - You came! - I forgot my key. This is what? Just see something through official you stay that way. You act like a child. It seems some drug. And yet, we have more that the necessities of life. It will never stop, do you? You make me ashamed. It pretends it's nothing. Its vulgarity and nonsense They give urge to vomit. We are becoming slaves these junk. And look at me when I'm talking! You can see from where you left and not even realize it. You know the problems I'm facing? They put my son out of school. The youth of today ... They do not help. You're lucky, do not have children. Maybe, but that her face That's not it. It is going wrong with the new companion? Why? Do you think that will not ... to work as usual? What about you? Why do not you divorce? I never thought about it. Perhaps Daniel think? Do you see forever? - It happens every once in a while. - You still sleep together? - Why the question? - Do not know... You no longer live together. They dumped each other. You should redo his life. It is what will happen, sooner or later. Is better... Sooner than later. After 20 years, as later you will find more only married men. You do not understand anything, my poor Suzanne. IT IS... Think whatever you want. IT IS... And think what? That will get rid of me, as well? And give you arrive and ... But you know What are you? You want me to say? You are a whore. And you know what they do with whores? They end up with them. There is a law against whores. But that's ... Men love whores. Dirty bitch They are running after them? Sure you do not prefer The crazy girls? It is, perhaps crazy. Do you see? I think I'm going leave my place for you? I am helping as I can. I'm just warning you. You bitch! Get out of here! - I thank you... - Bitch, bitch, bitch! - For coffee. - That's it, run away. Get out! You bitch! You know that there are things is not done?

Get your things and get out of here. Will work. Are you? Marjoline is not? I'm waiting for her. Come in, come. You did not know? You know what? She had a conversation with Mrs. Denise, who discovered one thing. You found what? Marjoline has ... a private clientele. Same? They are clients of the Institute. And? And... It is something that is not done. She was turned away. I wanted to help. Whether you are friend or not. And then, Ms. Denise It is a chore. If I could, also would come out of there. But I can not ... just me to take care of my son. But, I saw the face of the other girls the Institute. They were happy. They have a lot of envy the Marjoline. You have a beautiful terrace. You got sad. Do not be like that. Came just tell Marjoline I have a friend, which works in a very good home and it can search for it if she wants. I am sure that... No? Do not get so upset. You look so sweet. If you knew how difficult it is create a child alone. I not had much luck with men. It could be a matter choice. Do not you think? Do not.

I'm just a little sad not to see you more often. I need to have a conversation with you. I'm listening, Mr. George. You are running out with your marriage, dear. What do you mean? Once upon a time, a fisherman who lived with his wife the edge of the sea. They were very poor. One day he caught a small gold fish who told him, "Fisherman, let me go and give you three times what to order. " The fisherman released the fish who disappeared in the water. He returned home and told the story to his wife. She said, "Buster, we have nothing to eat. " "So let's try" said the fisherman. The woman, to show him his contempt and shouts, "I want my tank all stuck stay again. " Immediately, there is a huge noise. And a magnificent washing machine pops up. During 24 hours the woman is very happy ... Then he starts to grumble. "Why did you let me ask for so little? " "It's just make another request. We have the right. " "Now I want a house with every comfort. " Immediately, there is a huge noise. And both are discovered in a palace with all comfort. Elevators, American car on the door, at every step, servants asking what they want. To spend two nights, the third, a woman is so agitated that her husband asks her, "What's wrong with you?" She says, "Buster, why let me ask so little? " We are on the third request. "Do you miss? If a little something, say, but be careful, It is his third request. " "I want the gold fish come here to serve us. " She was just saying that, and the palace disappeared. And the fisherman and his wife back to hut boards, ragged as before. With the flat tank rotted. A policeman came to us, it seems like... you bought a refrigerator who can not pay. Ms. Denise gave him our address. Daniel does not know anything, by chance? Do not. Daniel does not know anything, by chance. Good night, girl. Good night, Mr. George. - Mrs. Donelle? - Yeah? Come in, please. - Hello! - Hello. Come in please. Sit down. Mrs. Donel ...
