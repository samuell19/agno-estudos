Things are gonna get crazy... Hey Dani, let's go, let's go! Go, go, go! Why are you pissing now, bro? - Hey, wait up, wait up! - Why are you pissing? Dude, why piss now? Hurry the fuck up! - Why piss now? - I'm gonna smack you, dude. Why are you pissing now, bro? We're late, come on! Come here and suck my balls! Why are you pissing? Why are you pissing? - Wait up, wait up! - Fuck! Hang on, I'm coming. Hey, dude! Wait up! These guys are raising hell over there. What's the hold up? Hurry up, bitch! - Why are you taking so long? - Hurry up, hurry up! Dude, come on! I got nothing and a little of everything! Come on, bro. Everybody's pissing here! Start the bike! Come on! Careful with the bike, for fuck's sake! Come on, bro! Little guy! Hey, hey! Yo, yo! Where's the party? You mean him? I doubt he wants to hear what I have to say. Look, I'd tell him I'm sorry, you know, that... That I'm sorry, yeah. For... for having fucked up part of his life, you know? Or any harm I caused him, or his family or whatever. To his mom, you know? As a kid, she was the one who looked after him, cared for him, helped him grow up strong, become who he is. It's distressing for her, you know? Sorry to all those people, I'd tell him, I dunno... I don't think I'd say much more. I doubt he'd want to listen to me. Straight up. Yeah, the usual, "I'm sorry." Now? Well, we have the hearing. I don't know, to be honest. I'm not really sure how the fuck it works... What it's going to be like, if I have to take the stand or something. I have no idea. The lawyer said the other day we'd be tried one at a time... That we weren't going to be tried all at once, but... That's something at least. Let's see what the hell they tell us. I really have no idea... What's going to happen next. I'm gonna go see Jamel, dude. He's cool. He might be crazy and all but But I know him, he's a good guy. Thing is... The drugs changed him a little, you know? But yeah, I wanna see him. He's been locked up so long that... He must be chunky by now, bulked up. Stocky for sure. Especially being so skinny smoking like that, you know? We'll see him soon, for sure. I think everything's gonna change today. Today, tomorrow things are gonna change for me... For better or worse, it's gonna change everything. But for the better I think, you know? The worst is behind us and every time it gets a bit better, you know? There are, like, different phases. I've been through the worst of it. What comes next isn't so bad. And so on, little by little, I'll pay for my mistakes. I think. But I don't know, not like that. And if I'm convicted, it'll be a year or so. I hope, anyway. That's fine. I don't remember anything. It's so weird, right? And they'll probably think I'm lying, but it's true. I can't remember a thing. Right when everything happened, I can't remember any of it. Right, let's see... What are the particulars? So I can get ahead a little and work out what the sentence will be. A year's prison sentence for each of them... Wait, okay, go on... ...with the suspended sentence being subject to... the payment of civil liability damages, this being a minimum monthly collective support payment of 2,500 euros and the surrendering of their passports. What does the plaintiff reject? The sum of 2,000 euros... He demands 3,500. They say they can't because they're in prison or because they're unemployed... No-one is in prison. Yes, Jamel is. Ah, I see, he's not here... Okay, one of them is in prison. So, three of them... What's the duration of the civil liability payment? Just under two years... 40,000 euros... or less. Less than two years. - Lawyers and defendants! - We're going to reach an agreement... Sort it out. But I need to leave today with a minimum agreement, and if that isn't 2,000, then we'll see. Because obviously... No, it's not "2,000 and we'll see." It's 2,000, minimum. Yes, but... Let's get started. Please be seated, bring in the defendants and fetch the prisoner. Take a seat here. Excuse me, Your Honor. These negotiations, without all the lawyers... ...and a 2,5 hour delay, we're finished here. Your Honor, we were negotiating... Okay, we're all set. It's a joint responsibility... But it's unfair for the only employed person to be burdened with the liability... While the rest are sitting pretty. What if one of them doesn't pay? Then the rest need to cover it. It's not the plaintiff's problem. Obviously, the plaintiff has to be paid the sum total of the civil liability damages agreed. Your Honor, it's also unfair for the two employed defendants to pay everything. Look, it's even more unfair if the injured party has to forgo payment. Then they should serve time. If we're saying it's unfair... I'm not going to allow another minute more if you don't reach a consensus. Not a minute more. - We're going to pay, really. - If you want to argue... for five hours, you should've talked to the prosecutor yesterday. But we're certainly not going to start the trial at 3:00 PM. Okay, fine. Your defendant better be the first one to start working and pay up as he's causing all this fuss. You can count on it, Your Honor. He can get a job slogging away at whatever's going. Let's see. Andrés, - is that right? - Yes. - Do you know what you're accused of? - Yes. - You admit to perpetrating these acts? - Yes. Do you abide by the penalties and civil liability demanded by...? - Yes. - ...the plaintiff? - Yes. - Be seated. Jonathan Echeverry. - Do you know what you're accused of? - Yes. - You admit to perpetrating these acts? - Yes. Do you abide by the penalties and civil liability demanded by the plaintiff? - Yes, Your Honor. - Be seated. Juan Sebastian Murillejo. - Do you know what you're accused of? - Yes. - You admit to perpetrating these acts? - Yes. - Do you abide by the agreed penalties? - Yes. Be seated. Natanael? - Do you know what you're accused of? - Yes. Do you abide by the penalties and civil liability demanded by the plaintiff? - Yes. - Be seated. Byron Alejandro? - Do you know what you're accused of? - Yes. - You admit to these acts? - Yes. Do you abide by the penalties and civil liability demanded by the plaintiff? Sit. Jamel Stalin? - Do you know what you're accused of? - Yes. - You admit to these acts? - Yes. - Do you abide by the penalties... - Yes. ...and civil liability demanded by the plaintiff? Sit. The defendants have complied. Does the Public Prosecution - wish to go to trial? - No, Your Honor. - The plaintiff? - No, Your Honor. - The defense? - No, Your Honor. Each of you are hereby found guilty, as the perpetrators on two counts of assault with a deadly weapon as outlined in articles 147 1 148 1 of the Criminal Code, in accordance with the amended provisions of criminal responsibility, aggravated abuse of superiority as outlined in article 22,2 of the Criminal Code and the qualified mitigating factor of undue delay of article 21 6 of the Criminal Code. The sentencing for these crimes is one year of incarceration, being barred from holding public office for the duration of the sentence. Payment of expenses, including those of the plaintiff as well as jointly paying damages totaling 59,733 euros and 22 cents, in addition to legal interests. So, I will ask the defendants as a whole and then I expect each of you to answer. Do all of you commit to paying the civil liability damages that at this time is in excess of, which totals between roughly 52,000 and 53,000 euros? Andrés David do you accept the obligation to pay? Yes, Your Honor. - Byron Alejandro. - Yes, Your Honor. - Jonathan Echeverry. - Yes, Your Honor. - Jamel Stalin. - Yes, Your Honor. Juan Sebastian. Yes, Your Honor. - Natanael de Jesús. - Yes. Accepting this obligation to pay is the legal condition that allows the granting of a suspended sentence. And of course, said suspension is also subject to the payment of civil liability damages. Given that the plaintiff does not object, the absence of any criminal record at the time of the crime, and that they have accepted their obligation to pay damages the suspension of sentences is granted for a period of four years, conditional on the payment of damages with a monthly sum of 2,500 euros. Will there be any appeals to this ruling? The Public Prosecutor? - No, Your Honor. - The Plaintiff? - No. - The defense? - No, Your Honor. - None? Then please sign the agreement. This concludes the proceedings, you can stop the recording. The prisoner may be accompanied out. Just tell me one thing, Jamel. That's you. - When will you be released? - February, Your Honor. - February, this year? - Yes, Your Honor. Okay, so we'll mail you the sentencing in a few days' time. - Okay. - Thank you. Goodbye. - See you later. - Goodbye. - See you later, Andresito. - Take care, brother. I'm stressed out because my friend's husband is really sick. Like I was saying, I'm freaking out here, really I'm going to have a panic attack, just thinking that I'm about to start a five-hour trial at 3:00 PM. Really, I'm so... Thanks, okay? Here we are, 'the working dead', bro. This is how you work, bitches. This goes out to all the immigrants in the gang. Yo, Nata. What's up, bud? When you gonna stop by? I've been out for 8 months and still haven't seen you. Jamel, what's up, bro? I miss you guys too. It's been almost a year and a half already... So... Any news from Andresito or what? Nah, bro. Andresito still can't even send letters. His girl told me they've stopped giving him money and he's all holed up. Off-grid. Bitches... I'm licensed to clean cake-holes and do dental work! Officially graduated, dudes! Way to go, Sebas! Congrats, Sebas! He's graduated, he's graduated! This is what a black man looks like after 15 hours of work. Take a good look, all sweaty. Look: Think you're the only one that sweats? Guys, Andrés just called me from jail, dude's got a phone. Andres, how's it going? Dude, what was I gonna say... Record a video for your homies, let's do a video call, or whatever. We wanna see you, bro. Can't wait til you get out. I can't. A buddy lent me his cell and I'm using up his megabytes and it's the only one we've got. I'll get my cell on Tuesday and we can have a proper chat, send some videos. Andresito! Dude. When are we gonna hang, bro? When are you getting out, man? Six days to go... That's it. Six days, so I'm golden. I'm golden. So what's daddy saying? Goddamn! Free at last, my bro! See you soon, bro. Big hug. Fellas, we gotta give Andresito a proper welcome, get together. What's up? I'm finishing a painting job. Still gotta do the second coat, but it's all good. What's up, dudes? Way to go, Andrés! Anyway, let me ask my boss because I've got days off and... He might even let me. I'll let you guys know. Yo! You know me, I'm so down! Tell me how much I have to put in, I'll tell Sandor and we'll get to it. You know, with the hand of God. Hey dudes! Sounds great, bitches. Let everyone know, let the guys know. I'll tell Beto and Menor and whoever else... And let's do it, bro. I can't wait, seriously. Back together again, dudes. Buy some steaks, bro, some pork chops, dude, chorizos, buy ham... ...Sausage fest! You're gonna bring the sausage, Jamel? Some T-bones, whatever you guys want. Whatever's easier. Some T-bones. If I'm free to choose... Just get the whole cow. Know what I'm saying? Just got off of work, gentlemen. So I'm not going back until I come back from Spain. See you soon. Over and out. Hey, Natalio, I've already talked to Laszlo and we are going to pick you up, okay? See you at the airport, man. See you later! Love you! Guys. I'm here watching shit on TV Great to hear Nata's coming. Anyway, I'm released tomorrow and I have the weekend off. What's up, Andresito? See you in no time. Let me know what time you're getting out and me and Chimaira will pick you up in my car. Last role call is at 8:00 tomorrow. I'll have breakfast here with a kid who's staying. And then, fuck it, bro! I'll bring my stuff down before too. I'll say goodbye to everyone. I'm sick of Madrid, bro, I wanna get out of here. Fuck off. I'm going to hit the beach, dude, get myself a coconut, a Hawaiian skirt and all, fuck it. Straight up. And when Andresito gets out, maybe he'll come with me. Look, I think that kid's from my neighborhood. Which one? - The one wearing the red tracksuit. - No shit... Whoa, he looks like shit, I hope he doesn't see me, otherwise he'll come over and get all chatty with me, bro. Bum a smoke off you, dude. That guy's in a bad way. Just look at him, bro. What's up, dudes? Out here waiting for Andresito. Laszlo, how's it going? Hey guys, I'm at the airport waiting for Nata. I just parked. Check it out, they're snoozing... Nata... Get your ass here already, bro... Grab your suitcase... I wanna bounce and light up a joint... There he is! What's up, bro, how you doing? Right on, Nata, you made it, dude! I made it! Damn right. Jamel Gucci ready to roll! Waiting for these guys to finish up at the supermarket, stocking up on provisions. We gotta get lots of stuff... Check out the 'lettuce boy'. Lettuce boy! Salad man! I'll just put it in my pocket, A bottle like that'll fit in my pocket no problem, see? Three of these, right? - Six times four, twenty-eight. - Gotcha. Three of these. - No, 24. - Sure, bro, they always come in 24. Can I get nine kilos of chicken wings? - Nine Kilos? - Yeah. Nine kilos, done. Nine kilos of wings. We're heading to the reservoir, boss! The reservoir awaits! Mario, more bread, dude! All the bread. Who cares. Let's just pay and leave. - Then let's just head... - Let's go, let's go, let's go. Dude, the cops, the cops are coming. Stop filming. They've stopped those guys, we got away just in time. Good thing too, 'cause of our papers. We're going outside. It's like a desert out here. Holy shit. Whoa, what the hell, dude? We're there already? - Shit! - Let's see, guys. Goddamn, I'd had it up to here... Holy shit! The "Bravos 4 ever," Fran "the fugly." There's shit everywhere, dude! And a Falange symbol drawn by some retard. Hey! - What the fuck? - Check it out. What the fuck is this? Check it out. Look. Jamel Gucci, 24/7, buried in shit. Come on, guys. All fascist-like... Charlie, your kitchen, bro. Your place. What's this, Charlie? - Goddamn. - What is this? Line up against the wall, guys. Come on, dudes. Come on, dudes! Present, bro. Jamel Gucci, present! - Present! - Jamel Gucci, present, dudes. - Okay? - There. Perfect. That's it. That's my boy. What's this shit you're using, Charlie? Tobacco. Fucking, fucking you know. It smells like shit, bro. What does it do? - What does it do? - Makes me chill, smoke less. - You know, Charlie? - I don't speak English. Lay off, okay? I'll put it back, I don't even want to touch it. Whatever. I don't understand what you're saying... Pisses me off. English, huh? Authentic 'madrileño' here. Gotta learn English, Charlie. Yeah bro, you're gonna finish paying up then you're moving to London, right? Yeah dude, six months to go and I'm done. Right, with a debt like that, it's impossible. Fuck dude, just imagine, €312,50 every month, it's a huge chunk of cash. Whoa, that'll be a load off, not having to pay 300 bucks a month... Just imagine what I can do with that. Save up, set up the barber shop. I dunno, dude. No idea how I'm going to react on the last day... The last payment... You're gonna throw a big party, right? Time to celebrate. That's also when I'm going to London, it's gonna be like the end of an era, starting from scratch. Straight up. A new life, bro. A new life, moving on! Yeah, dude. I can't wait. Hey, we need some kindling for the fire. Let's grab that trunk. Come on, bro, help me dig it out. Need some help, guys. Let's move this thing. Hey! Come on, guys! Move it over there. Over there. That's it, that's it. You and me, let's move this. Careful, there's broken glass. Help me pick up this trash. There was like one cop for each one of us. They frisked us. Like ten cops, for eight dudes, and we were just chilling. Doing the shopping. - Doing the shopping. - He asked about my tattoo in Hebrew, whether I was Jewish, you know? Why the fuck do you care about my religion, am I right? Or whatever the fuck I am... And I'm not even, but... Whatever, it was fucked up. Why they stop me? What about all them others? Like I'm some rat. I ain't doing nothing. "Stop and frisk..." It's a routine check... Fifty thousand other people walk by and they end up stopping you. And I'm like... Why don't they stop that guy or that lady? Nope. They stop you. They don't do this with other kids, you know? I think it depends on where you live, who you hang with, right? And maybe... Because you're black or Latino or white. Well, that doesn't make us bad people. Who's gonna get my back, right, if some hoods are walking down the street and they wanna mug me? The cops come and they'll probably end up arresting me. Well, my homies stick up for me just like I stick up for them. It really sucks though, that feeling. Like... like being a little scared. I don't know if it's fear. Because we're not really scared of them. But... But that feeling that if you speak up, you could end up being arrested for sitting in the park smoking a cigarette or for going for a walk with your girlfriend, holding hands, and they drag you away. That's not protection, it's intimidation. He's like: "have I insulted you?" I'm like, no, they wouldn't be so blatant, 'cause they're not idiots, them and their little mind games, they're just laughing at us. You know? It's just their tactic, they're doing it just to get a rise out of you, bro, and then they use it against you. We're no angels either. You know? Some of us here have been in prison, but we've done our time and what we did was jack shit compared to the punishment. Why didn't they say something before? We've moved on, we've got legit jobs, we're paying our way... Why do they need to bring up that crap from before? Going to prison and all, they could've given us that shit then, in prison, while we were serving our time. To me, it's not justice if justice comes late. - What's up, dudes? - Hey! - All good? - What's up? All good, bro. - Thanks for picking me up, guys. - Right on. I still stink. Stink of being inside, man. - You gotta be stoked, right? - Yeah, man. Coming to get me in a BMW and all. Fucking awesome. - What's up guys? How's it going? - Alright, dude. Kinda hot, isn't it? I feel like... ... getting some fresh air, hanging out the window. Getting my whole body out there, bro! Close the windows, I'm putting the AC on, guys. Hang on, someone's calling me. Hold up a sec, it's my boss. - Put your window down. - Hey, Juanma? Dude, check that out! Hey! How you doing, Juanma? Not bad, not bad at all, truth be told. They let me out for the weekend and I'm eligible for parole 'cause I was working and the case was dismissed a long time ago, you know? So... that's it, I'm ready to work 'cause that's what they're asking me for there and I'll be getting back to my old life, you know? I gotta sleep there every night, but anyway, I talked to David and I told him I was gonna talk to the social worker, to see if there's any way they could use a tag on me or something. I'll see what the options are and let you know. Okay. Bro! Want a little present? Like what? A wad of cash or something? - Jesus. Like what? A joint? - That's what I'm talking about, bro. Nah, man, I can't be smoking. - Why not? - 'Cause I get tested every Monday. When they send it to the lab I can't, I can't be smoking. It fell down there somewhere. Good thing. - Ah, okay. - Here. What was I gonna say... You tell the guys, bro, not to smoke around me either, okay? Look it's even gone and broke, dude. It's destiny. No worries, that's cool. That's cool, bro, no toking up. You gotta stay on the ball. Yeah, bro. Not like those guys. - Spaced out. They're still all doped up? - You bet. Well, I'm feeling sharp. It sucked, you know? 'Cause I couldn't. But... So, you were dying for a five-buck joint...? Yeah, 'cause it's not like I wanted to quit either. - But anyway, I'm done now. - I'm glad, I'm glad. No more joints, but I can have a beer, wine or whatever, you know? - That's allowed? - Sure. Ah, okay. Man, just look at the city and everything in the background. Crazy. It all seems so weird, dude. Everything's like, weird. You just got used to only seeing things up close in there, bro. Yeah, it all looks like... Blurry, you know. It's bad for your eyesight, bro. I know 'cause of my family. What d'you mean? Seeing everything so up close, then when you get out you need to look at things as far away as you can. Like even the sea, stare at the horizon as far as you can see, it's good for your eyesight. Sure, sure. Yeah, yeah. I was just staring at a wall all day long. - Right, that's not good. - I know... For your eyesight. Nata! - Nataaa! - What's up, Nata? You bastard. Come on! Nata, what's up? Hey, how's it going? - All right, yeah? - All right. Betito, how you doing? Hey, guys. What's up everybody! My turn, my turn! My turn, bro. "My turn, my turn" he says. We missed you, dude, it's been a while! - That black Englishman! - What a bastard. - A black Englishman. - Present. - Present! - Present. - You know it. - Present. - Jamel Gucci. - Present! Present! - Jamel Gucci. - Present! Present! - Hey, Natita! - What's going on, fellas? Hey Natalio. I hear you're trying to be a, dunno, what's it called? A handyman, you know, fixing things. - What do you work as, Enzo? - A handyman, bro. With your business card... That goes a long way, believe it or not. "Personal handyman". Lying, he's lying. - Congrats on your diploma. - Thanks, thanks a lot, bro. I got into college and I'm going to study tourism, bro. I get started in September, and they've hired me at my job, but I told them to gimme some leeway 'cause it was Monday to Friday, 9 am to 4 pm then from 5 pm til 9 pm. I'd have no time to study, you know? So I'll get school sorted first, and then start working. - You can clean my teeth now, right? - Yeah, whenever you want, man. I have this... crazy cavity here. - I can even put in a filling. - Whatever you want, except that. Nata still doesn't know how to brush his teeth. I got a removal company, you know? With my big brother, nothing big. Here in Spain, things are tough, bro. Things are fucked in Spain. Right now, I'm working - Construction. - Okay. Fucking sweet. I've got some legal issues, but let's see if I can sort them out. Yeah, man... You seem more focused. Right, dude. I'm thinking straight. I don't wanna mess things up. Cool, man. You should come with me and we can work together. Count me in, bro. Whatever you need. And what about Andrés? You think jail's gonna affect him? I think he's doing good, bro. He seems really focused on the video calls. He says he's fine there, reading books. Despite being in a fucked up cell block... But... but he's more focused, I think. He's gonna be fine, just fine. Truth is, I chat with his girl on Instagram from time to time and she sees the change. Like he's he's way more with it and he wants to do his thing too, you know? Come on! Fuck! Andresito's here, dudes! This butcher's letting me down, get on it! - Needs to be watered down a little. - Okay, bro. - Where's the water? - Who wants chicken? Nata could use a rinsing too. Easy there. Whoever's gonna eat that is gonna need some salt. Don't be talking like that to me, bro. Chill. How many years have we been doing this? - You did a good job. - It's happened to me sometimes. Aren't there forks or something? - Bro, come here. - What's up? Got a little present for you. Wow. Let's have a look. Hope you like it. Since you were still inside on your birthday, - I wanted to give you this. - Thanks, man. Open it, open it. - Can I open it or what? - Course you can! It's yours! Alright. Don't get it dirty. Nah, bro. It's a polo shirt, dude! Nice! No shit! That's sharp, brother. Damn, a low cost Lacoste. Wow, a Lacoste. Dude, is that from London or someplace? Like a tennis player's, right? Alright, dudes. It's totally dope. What's this? Check out the polo kid. Damn, that's nice. Polo looks sharp. - Very nice. - Damn! Cheers. Guys, we need the tubs for this. It's cool. Cut this, okay? Right, I'll cut it. I was out of a job, nothing lined up and a buddy of mine was a butcher, you know? And he hooked me up in his company as an apprentice... It was a total scam. How long were you there? 'Cause we made shit money, you know? And... And we were working twelve-hour shifts, you know? One day off a week, and I barely cleared 800 euros. They made me sign a contract, even as an apprentice. And the guy, the owner has a ton of butcher shops all over Spain, you know? So he was rolling in it... - And you're making shit money. - Shit money, bro. No other way, I just up and left. I quit, you know? I couldn't take it anymore, - I said, "I'm keeping the knives." - For real? - This dude knows how to speak Moorish. - Yeah? Yeah, man. I speak a little Arabic and he speaks a lot. Go on, say something... And what does that mean? "What do you want me to say, bro?" - He knows his stuff. - Straight up, dude. We're all bilingual here. Nata, this guy... We all speak 3 or 4 languages... - Even Quechua! - And this bilingual black dude right here! - Jamel speaks Dominican. - Dominican and Spanish. Fucking great, thank God... I remember when I had to go live there with my mom for two years when she went to make some extra cash, and it sucked. - The Dominican Republic? - I had a shit time. - Really? - Yeah, being away from my friends and everything, what was I supposed to do? That's shit, man. But then I got used to it and when they brought me back here I actually felt sad about leaving and all. 'Cause I left friends behind. That's the way it is sometimes. You get used to being somewhere and suddenly you gotta leave. You're happy to be with your family, but you're also missing somewhere else. It's like a weird feeling. When I left Morocco, it was the same, right? And I was like... "Back to Madrid again?" You gotta be kidding me. Upping and moving non-stop. When I first got here in 2013, I remember my mom took us to a room and that first night we slept in a bunk bed. She was underneath me and my brother, dude. He had his feet in my face and I'd hit his face with mine. That was an experience I'll never forget, you know? Lemons, we need some lemons. You've already cut like five. Dude, two more. One for me, one for you, bro. This one, it's bigger. - This one's mine, that one's for you. - Okay, okay. I was taught to share, bro. Put it there. - Hey! - Andrés. Open your mouth, open your mouth. Go for it! Do it! Don't backwash! Give it here! - Coming through. - Here, here. No more chicken, bro, I'm gonna grow wings. So stop eating! Cut it, cut it. Spit it out, spit it out! I'm telling you, the meat's under-cooked. Get your hand outta there. This guy hasn't had decent meat in a long time, bro. Let him enjoy it. - Let him enjoy it, bro. - A clean plate, a clean plate. A little bit of meat. Look at the guy, licking his fingers. We're all making good money, so it's all good, brother. It's not like before, bro. Hey champ, you can count on me. But I'm just not... I'm not convinced. You know? So, what you gonna do, bro? I'm chill, looking for a job... You know? It's what they want from me at this place, And... just take it easy, I reckon. I'm tired. Dude you're our Andresito, bro. What do you mean "no"? No, I don't think so. Look, I'm not saying it for me. I've got my shit together with these guys. I'm just saying, to help you out, you know? You're dealing with enough shit as it is. I dunno, bro. - I dunno... - It's an opportunity, you know? It's pretty straightforward... What's going on, fellas? Hey, having a chat. I need to tell you something, okay? - Think it over, it's good money. - Okay, bro. Cool. Come, come, come on, bro! Come on, dude, come on! Don't cry, bro! I'm not crying. Guys, quiet down... From here to the altar, right? - Guys, let him speak! - Come on, guys... - Andrés, go on, read it out. - I'll put who it was meant for later... But it's for everybody. "Hey homies, how y'all doing? I guess, I hope you're doing good. I'm chill, trying to make the best of it between these walls. I wanna make something clear. My girl is telling me about all your support and messages and that makes me feel like I'm not alone. I'm in a cell block called ETU Educational Therapy Unit. Truth is, at first, I was in a bad way, so bad I thought about suicide but bit by bit I started to make the best of things. To be honest, it's not like I've got used it, I wouldn't want to 'cause this cell block is for addicts, if you get what I mean." Wait, "so you get the picture. I'm in the most fucked up block in all of Spain. Not 'cause of the fighting, but 'cause of the rules and the treatment; it's not for me. That's why I can't reach out to you here. Everyone has to pass the test, they ask me if you're a good influence for me, as if you weren't. Anyway, I'd rather be with my girl, my family, without so many things getting in the way. So, through her, I'm sending my words and thoughts. I hope and I know that you're all chill. Remember, everything can be fixed, except death. And I was close, but I kicked death's ass with the strength... - with the strength you gave me..." - Right on! "So when I get out I can see everyone and make the most of probation." - We love you, dude. - Go on, bro. "And if you want, I can tell you how this happened to me, how I ended up here. Ah well, you can't answer, I'll just answer anyway. As you know, I was in Asturias and A Coruña working on my last job. In Gijón. I was just one day from finishing setting up the stores and when I left work I went to the hotel. I saw come police cars driving around. Driving around... As I wasn't expecting it, I wasn't rattled. I hadn't changed out of my uniform or even washed my hands so when I got to the hotel I was gonna get straight in the shower. And walking back with my co-worker, that's when I saw them, just outside Hotel Doña María, two squad cars and another undercover car. They came towards us, all calm and they ask me and my co-worker, "Are you Andrés David...?" And I say: "That's me." And they say, show us your ID, come this way, the cop tells me, still all calm." Hang on 'cause... I wrote this out of order. "But you have to come with us." "I didn't understand why I was being taken in. My co-worker was as blown away as I was. When I got to the police station, the boss treated me well. No complaints, really, and they told me I had a judicial summoning in Madrid, but they didn't say I was gonna end up in prison. That happened at the holding cell at the court in Gijón, when some dude came down telling me that I had to go to prison 'cause of the judicial order and my stay at that hotel was gonna be 10 months. Truth is, since I'd been through all that before, all I wanted is for the van to come and take me away." I mean, like, take me to prison. "'Cause I was fucking sick of being in the holding cell and I wanted, and I wanted to call someone or my girl to tell them the mess I was in. When I got there we were processed..." Being processed is when they give you your new ID and all that. "They gave me my new ID and I knew we were gonna be locked up..." No, wait, "they gave me my new ID, or NIS, they call it and we were quarantined. We had to be isolated for 10 days. It's a cell with a bed, no TV or radio. So basically, I left a holding cell to go to another one and stayed there for 10 days. We only had an hour in the yard and I went out with the cellmates I'd met in the police van. He was, and is, a stand-up guy. They had him drugged up all day long, but the medication didn't make him sleep. It made him talk so much that he was annoying even when, when... when he was sleeping, he'd be talking." That bastard could talk even when he was asleep. "...yapping about his exploits. Lol. So I was locked up for 240 hours minus 10 hours in the yard, but I was still locked up. Lol. I mean, the isolation was... ... the yard." Hang on, "I was still locked up." This is just a rough draft, I was gonna tidy it up. "Lol. The ones in isolation were better off, but hey, what doesn't kill you makes you crazier, stronger. In my case, all the bad things came at once. I wanted them to make me stronger and I almost got there, but it left me with that fear, fear of hurting myself. When the day to leave came round and they took me to the cell block..." Fuck. "I was jacked on adrenaline, happy to get out of there, I mean, out of that isolation. But when I got to the ETU, I hit rock bottom, and I said, shit, I wanna go back to quarantine." Back to isolation. "Another inmate was assigned as my monitor. We did everything together except wiping my ass, straight up, 'cause he was always with me and he had to report everything I did and didn't do, like I was telling you. Lol. In my ward there are 170 people. We're split into groups of 10 or 12 guys made up of support, follow-up and the rest are inmates without responsibilities. I can't talk to other inmates from other groups, only to the guys in my group. Otherwise I'm breaching group rules and they can report you. If you're reported three times, the guards will be on your case..." Then they review you and make you clean stuff, whatever they want, you know? That's like the worst punishment. But it's just bullshit, really. "I don't mind, tbh 'cause I do a good job, I just get on with it, and so far I haven't broken any rules. When I get out, I'll tell you more about it all 'cause I don't feel like it right now. You just have to play by the rules. And that's it. That's basically it. I exercise, I eat well, thanks to..." Here I've put: "Javi and Nacho, Luis who make sure that I get my wage and buy me food. I share a cell with a 56-year-old man that's been in and out since '87. In other words, an old dog, stubborn, likes to argue, but I get along with him, to the point I put reggaeton on full blast at 7 in the morning." 'Cause I'd turn on the radio and they're always playing reggaeton. "At the... at the time we have to get up. I've got a TV now, it's his. We watch movies and soccer and that 'First Dates' show." It's what's on. It's fun, I swear. "Whatever he likes, but he asks me what I don't like, to let him know." So he'd change channel, he's flexible. "There are inmates here with life sentences, the maximum, and then others sentenced to 50, 40, 30, 20, 15, 10 years... and then me, with a 10-month sentence. But a conviction is a conviction, it's not something I'd wish on anyone. Everyone seems normal, and they are, except the drug addicts, 'cause, damn, if you think you've seen crazy... Think again. There are some guys I really feel sorry for. Seeing them like that... and sorry for myself for being there. Then there are transfers from other prisons and then me, in that group of normal people. Lol. I'll explain it all in more detail. If you want. All of it, if you want." And then... I dunno. Then I think it was this part. "Sometimes I think about the months I have to skip my payments for my share of the trial. As the judge said if one of us doesn't pay up, we all go to prison. And I hate to think it could screw you over since I don't know if you're paying or not. Well, I'm sure Nata is. If the rest of you are, don't freak out, when I get out I'll find a way to pay what's overdue and catch up. My lawyer says it normally takes them a few months to realize, so I hope I have time to get things sorted so that none of you have to be here and I can get out without serving both sentences." "This is the second summer of my life that's been taken from me and the truth is that I'd never wish this on anyone. It's a huge blow, mentally, and when you get out, you have to rebuild little by little otherwise, you'll be back. This place doesn't rehabilitate you, it just forces you to play the game... The ones who step on the yellow tiles win, and those who don't, lose. In a nutshell: know where to step or be stepped on. So don't even think about this place. It doesn't, it doesn't give you any prestige. It just means you all can take advantage... ...gives you an advantage, while I'm here, watching the days go by, slower and slower. If you want to hear gangster stories, I've got loads to tell, or go and buy a book a gangster book! The guys here are tougher than gangsters. The only thing that matters here..." Hang on. "... is your mind, not how strong you are or how big your cock is. Thanks, homies, I know that you're, I know you're all out there, thinking of me. I think of the things we used to do, like going to the river or just cruising around Madrid. I love you, bitches. Best of luck to you all." Yeah, yeah! Andresito, we love you, man! That's it. Come on bro, you're out and you're here. Come on, dude... You're not alone, dude. we love you loads. You're not alone, okay? - You're the best. - You're not alone, bro. Come on, little guy. You're not alone, bro. we love you loads. It's for me, asshole. Let's go ahead with it. I don't give a shit. They're grown ups. How's it hanging, bro? What's up, dude? Hey, bro. Sorry for joking around before. No sweat, man, it's all good. You're just a little annoying sometimes, that's all. I know, bro. But, that's just the way I am. No doubt. Chill, man, you went a little off the rails back there, huh? I guess... Give me a light. Being in prison fucks with you. I lit it the wrong way around. 'Cause it helps you... It's all soaked. Goddamn... How are things with you? Better? You even look chubbier. Hanging in there, cuz. I don't even wanna hear about that shit. I'm all freaked out. Right. You're chubbier, Willy. There's the water, bro. Free Willy. This is a little frothy, dude. Cheers to what? - 'Cause you're the best, bro. - You too, dude. You more. Gimme the lighter back. You'll keep it otherwise, I know you. Oh wait, I got it. Gimme a break, you little shit. Sorry, bro. I'm freaking out about tomorrow. I'm up shit creek, cuz. Right when I've met this girl too... And settling down, dude... They come at me with this shit from back then... I'm freaking out, dude, seriously. I just wanna forget about it. Totally check out. It's in God's hands... And if they catch me, they catch me after their investigations. - You know? - Right. I'm not gonna give... turn myself in, bro, honestly. No chance. They can come get me whenever they want, you know? Right. I didn't get any help, bro. You're telling me that you don't wanna go to jail now 'cause... 'cause... because you... you feel loved and you don't want to leave that in case you lose it, dude. - Like I said... - Yeah, I wouldn't want to lose - that shit. I've never felt that way. - But I love you, bro. It's not the same thing, bro. - You love me as a friend. - Same here. I'm being serious, 'cause you can't fuck me. And if you could fuck me, huh? It's not the same thing, Andrés! Dude, quit it. It's not the same thing. It's not the same thing, bro, it's not the same. I love you as a friend, bro and you you love me as a friend, bro. You're not gonna come to a conjugal visit. And me neither, bro. - Know what I mean? - I'm not showing for that! That's what I'm saying. 'Cause you can't go in. You giving your fingerprint ID... "Hey, you're staying here, bud." Bro, it's not the same thing! You stupid or what, what's wrong with you? It's not the same thing, bro. I don't know if you know what... You're gonna put your girlfriend, who's there day and night, before me? And I can't go over... Go over and visit you. - It's not the same thing, bro. - That's bullshit. You get what I'm saying. Is she there, day and night? Bro, I've been in jail, and my sister was the only one who visited me, dude. Knocked up. No-one from the skate park either, brother. - True. - That said, when I got out, and started using again, you were there for me, you got my back, helped me to get my act together, to get clean. You gave me a roof, a shower, I've crashed at your place, bro. But... Now I have something, something worth fighting for, bro. A family, a girlfriend... She wants me to have a kid with her. I have something, brother... Worth fighting for, something to be excited about. That's why I wanna forget about this shit 'cause I'm fed up and I'm scared, bro. I can't stand it anymore. Not 'cause you're my friend or that other guy's my friend, or the other guy's my friend. That's probably why, dude. Bro, I don't know what freedom means to me. But when I see my mother all happy, my girlfriend... Even you guys, you know? Well, that gives me peace of mind and that kind of calm makes me feel free you know? I don't know... Remember when we'd call ourselves "The Bad Family" when we were kids? I have no idea why we called ourselves that. In the end, time goes by and we're still together, which is what matters. Like a family, bro. We should help each other out more. Look after each other. And talk things over, you know? What do you want me to pay? Unemployment? Seriously, dude, I've been paying and I'm gonna carry on anyway... So, if y'all can't pay and something happens, bro, I'm gonna keep paying 'cause I'm fine with it, bro. Brother, we're not you. Our situation's different. So, listen to me. What matters most to me is that everyone's free and happy, bro. - That's all that matters. - But not all of us can pay up like you! - Dude. - What I'm trying to say, bro, is that, if y'all can't pay and I can keep paying, I'm gonna keep paying, you know? And it's cool, man. I don't care about all that. I just want everybody to be free and happy. Well, I can't pay, bro. I don't care if you can or you can't. I've been locked up from the get-go. - I can't pay. - Are you paying your fine? - Absolutely. - You're paying your fine in full, every month? Well, no, I skipped a year but I caught up last month. I wanna know your situation. Just be straight with us. - Don't lie. - No, that's just my situation and what I think. Dude, your situation is your old lady's helping you out and your old man... Or whoever. - Is that my fault? - I have zero support, been in jail, bro. Zero visits from anyone and zero cash, my friend. It's not my fault if I got support! I can't afford to pay anything, bro. - And that's that. - But what I'm saying... - What I'm saying is... - I can't pay a dime. - And I'm not gonna. - If you don't wanna listen... - whatever, man. - It's in God's hands, bro. If I can't, I can't. I've tried and I can't. That's it. Well, guys, the truth is, I... God knows I've tried. Well, truth is, I was paying up until this January and I haven't paid since 'cause I had some debts, honestly and... Just this month I'm gonna start paying 'cause I haven't actually paid since January, but I know... I know what's going to happen to us if we don't pay 'cause the judge was crystal clear: either we pay or we serve time. - So, I gotta catch up with the payments. - Then we'll pay, bro, 'cause I can't pay. What do you expect me to do? - Look, I get you, but... - I don't have the money or... - I get it. - Now I have my girlfriend, bro, - I got my girlfriend, bro. - Someone who loves you, dude. I can't pay a dime. - I can't pay anything. - Don't get upset, bro. - I can't pay anything. - Don't get upset, bro. - Don't get upset, bro. - I'm really sorry. I can't pay, that's why I'm scared 'cause I can't pay jack shit. And it's not 'cause I don't wanna, bro. I just can't 'cause there's no money. So, I can't pay, my friend. Period, that's it. - But hang on... - Do whatever you want, brother. - Actually, I also... - Since it's 300 and something... ...300 and something, when I've had it, I paid up to 100, I haven't paid everything, I've paid 100, sometimes 150... I stopped paying. I was paying and I stopped. And when I stopped, a few days later, the lawyer sent me a letter, saying: "the judge wants you locked up." Her words, bro. For not paying, for not paying. And now I'm just waiting for them to come get me. - Me too, no doubt. - I'm waiting to be locked up for not paying, I dunno... I've paid 1,500 euros already. Then I dunno know how you can just walk around so carefree. Because, bro, I'm... I'm not thinking about... I'd be down in the dumps. What am I supposed to do? I'm getting started, bro. I'm getting a job, finding a girl, and when I think about it... I say, fuck! Dude, they're just gonna steal all of that from you, just like that. And I think, fuck, but I can't even afford to pay! - Then what? - What do you prefer? - Going back to prison? - I can't pay, brother! I can't pay! Little by little, Jamel... - I can't, brother! - Not even 20 euros... - 20 euros, bro. - You know my situation. - I can't, I just can't! - I know, dude. I can't! - Dude, I can't, dude. - 20 euros, bro. - I just can't. - Well, that's it. Period. I can't, brother. That's that. What do you expect me to do? Magic, bro? I can't. I can't, I can't. I can't, brother, I can't. Dude, what do you want from me? Magic? Nobody's judging you. No-one's saying you done anything wrong. - Come on, bro... - God-fucking-damn it. You can't even pay 20 euros? Yeah, I can, bro. I can! But I just got out 8 months ago, after being locked up, bro. - Explain. - Listen to me, brother. I'm getting to know this girl. I've had to fend for myself just to be able to live in a garage, my friend. A garage that I've turned into a kinda home. You know? I was living in a garage, bro, and nobody asks me, "Jamel, you need anything?" No. - 'Cause you didn't tell your friends... - Well, that's it. I can't, brother. I can't, brother, 'cause it's impossible for me. I can't. I'm only just surviving, and I'm supposed to pay a fine... I can't, brother. It's in God's hands. That's why I'm scared to walk down the street. Understand? Man up and pay up, dude. No, bro, it's not "man up and pay up." I'll "man up" with whatever sentence they throw at me. A two-year sentence... So, that's it. I can't pay the guy. You dudes pay - and I'll serve two years. - No Jamel, that's not the... I can't, brother, I can't! Well, ask your friends, dude, if you can't. That's what we're here for, bro. Then lend me 2,300 euros. - I can't, just like that... - Bastard! But, bro, if you tell me you can't pay, I'll help you. Whatever dudes, I'm just gonna get up and leave... Y'all are really breaking my balls here, I swear, bro. I can't, bro, and God knows I've tried, but I can't. There's not a lot you can do from prison, bro. - You don't get what I'm saying... - I can't, bro, I can't. Can't you tighten your belt a little? I can't brother, I can't! I can't! Nata, drop it. He's not listening. - I can't, bro. - Let's drop it, drop it. - I can't, cuz. - Let's drop it. - I think... - I've tried, but I can't. I can't, Chimaira. I can't 'cause I don't have a legit contract, - I don't have a steady job... - Look harder then. Right. - Straight up... - Go fuck yourself. - Whatever, man... - Go fuck yourself. Whatever. I'm just telling it like it is. Listen to me. I'm about to beat your ass... I can't, bro. Period. I can't. You've been free this whole time! Walking free, bro! I've been in chains! - It hasn't been easy... - All that time, all of you roaming free... You can't hold that against us! I've been in shackles, brother! No reduction on the payment! They haven't taken off a dime! You can't say that, man. I spent 7 fucked up years in England... Brother! They haven't reduced it at all! I've been locked up 4 times longer than you guys. Quit using jail as an excuse! You can't say that... Don't be like that, Jamel, you prick. No, brother. - Goddamn it, dude. - Alright, bro, just let it go. 'Cause he was in jail... He can't say that, bro. While you've all been free, I've been in prison, bro. Fine! And I'm next! I'm next, and just look at me! I'm next! - I'm next, maybe next week! - I've already been! - I'm going too! - I've already been! Well, maybe I'm next, dickhead! - I've already been. - What about me? What about me? What about the others? Unbelievable, bro! He can't be talking shit like that... Not cool, dude. Goddamn it! I'm the only one who's been paying the price from the get-go, assholes! And y'all couldn't have cared less! You shitbags! And I've paid for it on my own! I haven't bitched about anyone! That's what you're doing right now, jackass! Let him think whatever he wants. Chimaira, you're a piece of shit! Sure, whatever, let it go. Chimaira, Chimaira. Chimaira, Chimaira, just let it go, please. Leave him, let him be... Chill, brother. Go fuck yourself, man! He knows what he's done... - Everybody here.. - I don't... I've accepted it. I've sacrificed a lot of things so I can pay up. I've also stopped buying stuff, bro, to pay the fine, you know? Whether you guys pay or not, you know? I'll hit him with the camera, is that what you want? - 'Cause I can hit him with the camera. - Come on, bro, chill. Andresito, what's up, bro? I figure you're on your way back to prison. I just wanted to say how important it was to see you and hang out. The other guys were saying how great it was meeting up after so long... And by the way, Jamel says he's been trying to call you and you're not answering. Talk to him, bro. He wants to apologize, he feels shit about what happened. And you know that issue stresses him out, and he's sorry things turned out like that. But anyway... Don't stress about that. I don't want something that happened eight years ago to still be driving us crazy. I wasn't expecting something like that either, but... We really needed to talk it over. It's fucked up, but... If we don't know each others' situations it's harder to help each other out. But anyway, don't stress, everybody knows that locked up, there's not a lot you can do. Those of us on the outside are gonna do everything we can to pay up and when you get out, you'll find a way to pay us back, but don't stress about that. Anyway, it's good to see you doing well and that we're all trying to find peace of mind, get our lives on track... I can't wait for all of this to end... Nothing hanging over us, nobody in jail... You could even come visit me in London. Anyway, never forget that you're a stand-up guy, bro. Remember that while you're inside. Chin up, you know we're here for you, good times or bad, it doesn't matter. We're a family and that means forever. We love you, bro.
