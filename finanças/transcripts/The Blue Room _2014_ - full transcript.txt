Did I hurt you'? No. Are you angry'? No. Will your wife ask any questions? No... No, I don't think so. Does she ever'? No. Do you love me, Julien'? I think so. Aren't you sure'? Could you spend your whole life with me'? "Did she bite you often?" "Sometimes." How often? "Julien Gahyde accused of murder..." We saw each other eight times. Only eight times in a whole year'? It was just eleven months. It all began in September. "How many times did she bite you?" "Perhaps three..." "or four." "During the act?" "I think so... yes." “Yes? "NO-" Are you still bleeding'? It's just about stopped. What will you say if she asks you'? I'll tell her I hit the windshield when I braked too hard. "Did it ever occur to you that she bit you deliberately?" "What?" "I'm asking if you think she bit you on purpose?" Could you really spend your whole life with me'? Definitely. Are you absolutely sure'? - Wouldn't you be a bit scared'? - Scared of what'? Can you imagine how we'd spend our time'? - We'd end up getting used to it. - To what'? To the two of us. "You never considered the possibility of an anonymous letter?" "Nobody knew about us." She came in the door on rue Gambetta and came upstairs without being seen. - You're sure about the hotel owner'? - Yes. - The maids? - We never saw them. That just leaves one person. Who? You don't know'? It's not possible, Esther. Why?" When I think of all the years I've wasted because of you. Because of me'? Who went away'? Me'? Seriously, Julien, tell me... If I could get away... Would you'? What do you mean'? I'm asking you if... your husband... is crossing the square. Is he coming to the hotel'? Making straight for it. - Does he look angry'? - I don't know. He's got his back to the sun... Where are you going? We knew each other as kids. We were in the same athletic club. I meant your sexual relationship with Esther Despierre. - You had one before'? - Before what'? - Before she married your friend. - Nicolas wasn't my friend. - Let's say your classmate then. - We were just at the same school. It didn't happen before their marriage'? It would never have occurred to me. Why not'? Because she was too tall. And besides, she was Dr. Herbreteau's daughter. Socially we weren't on the same level. "Can you imagine what we'd do?" We'd end up getting used to it. To what?" "To the two of us." Could you really spend your whole life with me'? Definitely. Are you absolutely sure'? Wouldn't you be scared'? A bit... a bit scared. You asked her - scared of what'? Can you imagine how we'd spend our time'? We'd end up getting used to it. Used to what'? To the two of us. It's Daddy! - Your mouth is bleeding. - I bumped into something. - What'? Where'? - A telegraph pole in the street. Mummy! Daddy bumped into a telegraph pole. Is that right, Julien'? Yes. See, it's nothing. - You weren't too hot'? - Not really. I've to read something. I'll be right back. Can I come, Daddy'? Of course. "You came back to live in St. Justin about 4 years ago?" "Did you get in touch with her?" "I used to see her in the pharmacy, that's all." "In 4 ears ou must have seen her Y, Y somewhere else once in a while." "A couple of times, yes." "Her husband was sick and didn't drive." But you already knew that. - Did you speakto her'? - I said hello. - From a distance'? - From a distance or up close, depending. Often? Life is not the same while you're living it as when you look back on it. Tell me how it all started. How lucky you were passing, Julien. You were already friends? From when we were teens." - Go on. - She said:". - The one time I don't have a jack... - Do you have a spare tire'? - I'll make you late. - Oh, you know, with my job... Did you meet your wife in Paris? - No, in Poitiers. - Is she from Poitiers'? From a village near there. She was working in town. "Do you like blondes?" "I used to wonder if brunettes scared you." "Why?" "Because you used to kiss all the girls except me." "I don't think I ever thought about it." Do you remember Louise Perroux'? She stuttered. Yes. You ran after her for months. - I caught you together once. - Behind the gym'? I hated her. In bed at night I used to wonder how I could make her suffer. - Did you figure it out'? - No. I prayed she'd get sick or have an accident that disfigured her. I go to Triant every Thursday. I know. Perhaps... Would you like to kiss me just once'? Yes. Come on. Do you want to'? Come on. I didn't think she was like that. There's no right or wrong answer. I thought she was cold, stuck up, made of stone. "Mr. Gayhde," "what exactly were you afraid of that evening?" "Did you think Nicolas was violent?" No. - “ Did you wonder if he was armed? - No, I never thought that.“ Did you fear for your relationship'? No." "Didn't you have the impression you'd lost her after that?" - Who'? - Esther?" Here you are. For 11 months you had been living what we might call a grand passion. Would you like to go to a movie'? What day is it'? Thursday. - What would we see'? - I don't know, we'll find out. Sure, if you like, yes. I'll call Sophie. She's ugly and she smells bad! Without her babysitting you'd be all alone at home. I'm not scared. Sophie'? Hello, it's Delphine. Yes. If you could come right now, we'd like to go to the movies... "A tiny little smile which hardly made her mouth move," as if she wanted to keep it to herself. What did you find so seductive about her'? Yet more words! I never asked myself. Did you love her'? Did you want to sleep with her'? - Didn't you desire her'? - I obviously did, since I married her. - And did she love you'? - I dunno, I think so... So a divorce was never mentioned'? - Never. - But you told your mistress... I never told her, she's lying. We were both naked, we had just... Obviously one doesn't care what's said at such a time. I hardly heard what she said. I nodded, muttered yes or no... "but thought about other things." "About what?" "I dunno." You go buy the tickets and I'll park the car. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening, sir. I'd like to pay for the minibar, I didn't have time earlier. - Oh please, it could wait. - I would preferto. Here it is. The other gentleman paid for his drinks on the terrace. - Nothing else? - No. Thank you. "Do you love me, Julien?" “Yes? "You wouldn't be scared?" "Scared of what?" "You are so handsome that I'd like to make love right in the square." Tell me, Julien... Don't you think that Suzanne is looking a little pale'? Yes. I met Dr. Gelbard at the pharmacy this afternoon. He said that some sea air would do her good. We could go on Saturday. Do you think it's possible? It's August and I'm afraid nothing would be available. Why not that hotel... at Sables d'Olonne'? Do you remember'? The Black Rocks. That's the one. I'll call tomorrow. Normally you go and check whether Suzanne is still breathing. I know. When I'm at home, I feel as though I'm protecting her. That we're protecting her. - Good night, Julien. - Good night. "I wonder if by suggesting a holiday to your wife..." She'd just talk about how pale Suzanne was. You wanted to take the opportunity of playing the good husband. The good family man. What do you think about that'? It's not true. You're insisting the idea was to get away from your mistress? More or less. You had already decided not to see her again? I didn't have a definite plan. "Did you see her again in the next few months'? - No." She didn't give you the signal? I dunno, I avoided going near the pharmacy. And all that because you saw her husband come out of the station. You claim she's the only woman with whom you achieved full sexual satisfaction. If I remember correctly, you spoke of a veritable... revelation. Suzanne, don't move! Don't scream! Don't move! It's okay. It's gone! Does it taste good'? Look at this. It's cute. "Visitor." Are you sure you didn't come back to see Esther'? - Again! I've just been assigned to defend you... and I haven't read your whole file yet. However... do you think that Nicolas Despierre had... in some way "bought" Esther or that his mother had done it for him'? Perhaps. Did you resent Nicolas for being rich'? Because his parents gave him a motorbike for his 14th birthday? What are you thinking about'? You. And what are you thinking'? That I'm lucky to have met you. "Are you very ambitious, M. Gahyde?" Depends what you mean by that. When I was 12, I had to get a job to buy myself a bike. I'm wondering whether leaving the region for 15 years... was enough to turn you into a stranger here'? Your father was no longer young when you were born. 43 years old. - Are you the oldest? - Yes. Then there was my sister Agnes. Does she live here'? She died when she was a baby with my mother who was driving. - How old were you'? - 7 years old. Your father brought you up'? Yes. Didn't you question him'? Did you get much out of him'? He's not crazy. I'm not crazy'? That has never been suggested. So why are you questioning me for the 6th or 7th time'? Just because the papers claim I'm a monster? Thank you, madam. Thanks a lot. Cell phone - Esther Despierre Despierre/Gahyde. The Blue Room L'Hotel de la Gare. About this signal... "whose idea was it?" "Hers. I've already told you that, Your Honor." "A towel?" "On Thursdays, if she was free, she'd hang a towel out the window." "So, every Thursday morning...'?" "I walked past the pharmacy." Enough. I know how to swim. And again. Good morning, Your Honor. Good morning, please excuse us for being late. Take off the handcuffs, please. - Can you bring me the file, please? - One moment. - Are you thirsty'? - No, thank you. Good. We'll wait for the secretary. It's for you. Suzanne. Suzanne, wake up. Why are you turning here'? They're working in the street. You need to call Mr. Dupuis back. Yes. - Tell him tomorrow. - Okay. Around 11:00. Julien Gahyde Agri-Tec - Les Varennes. "Everything is fine. Don't be scared." - We can come to an agreement. - Pretty soon, yes... - We'll work it out, Mr. Verdier. - Of course. - If you have a good harvest... - I'll work it out. So, you came back from Sables with your wife and daughter on... August 17. The following Thursday, you had an appointment at 10 with a Mr Felix Hurloz, secretary of a Farming Cooperative. You had lunch with him. And you preferred to go all the way to Montigny... to buy aspirins and some saline solution, just to avoid coming face to face with your mistress. I don't know, those weeks are a complete blank. Tell me... Are you serious? Yes, but perhaps it's not the right time'? Garcia! Garcia! You don't want to buy up the whole region, do you'? "Could you say you had decided neverto see her again?" I can't say it was an actual decision. Isn't that because you kept track of her in other ways? Which article, Your Honor'? D186. I didn't keep track of her. On October 10... This is such a beast to get repaired! - It's the pulley. - Not the gear shift? They already came to fix it but it won't work. The harvest's already in. I'll lose everything. - My credit ranking... - Enough about your credit ranking! Can we talk'? The machinery's on credit, too. It's always the same. They came to fix it right away. You're insured. Enough! "Soon. I love you." "Soon. I love you." "You don't recall the third letter at all?" "I suppose you burned those letters and any that came after." "Learn to spell these words to prepare for a dictation." - Okay, what are the words'? - Stone... I managed to escape. Good evening. Church, Road, Horse. I went to get the jam. H.909' ...Farmer, Lights. "Do you remember what you did on October 31'?" You went home, had dinner then watched T.V... That's what you told the chief of police. And I went to bed at the same time as my wife. - Can you confirm those statements? - Yes. And you still say you had no idea what was happening just 3km away'? - How could I have known'? - The letters. You're forgetting the letters, M. Gahyde. I see you're denying them but I don't. Are you coming, Daddy'? "Were the first floor windows closed too?" "I don't know. I didn't look up." "So your indifference means..." "your relationship with Esther Despierre was over?" "I think SO." "Or you didn't look up because you already knew?" "No, I didn't know." Emergency closure. "Didn't you notice how the other customers looked at you'? - No." "So, when did you hear that Nicolas Despierre had died?" "I have here the testimony of Mr. Didier Chaline, your neighbour." "who states that he said to you " It was bound to happen one day..." and make a certain woman very happy". Yes...'? I'm in the middle of an interrogation. The 9- 12- 43'? It's May 13, I think... Wait... I'll confirm that. Yes, that's right, May 13. No, just extend it. There's a number of them and the victim was under 15. We'll talk about it later. Forgive me, M. Gahyde. No problem. Where were we'? Ah, yes! Mummy! Mummy! The man from the pharmacy died. "What was your wife's reaction?" "No particular reaction. She turned to me and said..." Is that true, Julien'? He served me just the day before yesterday. Can we go to the funeral'? Children don't go to funerals. It's not fair! Funeral for the pharmacist from St. Justin. Try to make the judge understand... Water'? Yes, please. And you didn't try to find out how Nicolas diedT? He had been in hospital back in September. Everyone knew he was sick. Did you know that... on that night, Dr. Gelbard was, for once, not in St. Justin? No. - He looked after your family too'? - Yes. So you know that he's hardly ever out of town. And the day before he even went to the pharmacy to tell Nicolas he'd be away. What does that make you think'? Nicolas' mother... Mme. Despierre... said that on October 31, she went to see her son around 8 p.m. Esther washed up after dinner, then went to bed not feeling well. - At 3:00, your friend Esther... - That term is prejudicial. At 3:00, Esther Despierre called Dr. Gelbard, as if she had forgotten he was away. Instead of calling Emergency she woke up her mother-in-law, and when they came into the bedroom Nicolas was dead. Mme Despierre found it unecessary to call another doctor. So it was only at 11:00 that Dr. Gelbard arrived to see Nicolas. Given his medical history, he scarcely looked at him before signing the death certificate. Do you have anything to say about that'? The investigation... confirmed that the doctor was away that night. A fortunate absence for someone who wanted to get rid of the pharmacist... and make people think he had died from another of his attacks. At the funeral everyone knew about the two of you... and watched you both while... they looked at your wife with pity. All this doesn't matter to you'? Do you really think your wife didn't know'? "And that she wasn't expecting something to happen?" Right. "After Nicolas Despierre's death" "the pharmacy and the houses were left to the two women." "There was a lot of talk in St. Justin." Listen to this! "The body of Nicolas Despierre isn't even cold and already the two women are fighting over the inheritance." "Wasn't there a lawsuit" "between Esther Despierre and her mother-in-law?" "I heard something about one." "Supposing that your wife knew about your relationship with Esther." "Would she have mentioned it?" "Perhaps not." A lot of people thought Esther would sell up and go away with you. That decision depended on Esther. Esther's decision depended on yours. After some time, everyone stopped talking about it. Okay. Let's go! Cover him up. Comments please! - Have a good holiday Emmanuel. - You too. See you tomorrow. Goodbye, Francis. Here's your mail M. Gahyde. Have a good holiday! - Enjoy the holiday. - Thank you, goodbye. OUR HAPPY NEW YEAR! Happy New Year, Delphine. Happy New Year, Julien. YOUR TURN! "Here's the statement of Pierre Marchal, the mailman." Bad news, Julien'? "I had never seen him like that." He looked as though he'd received a death sentence. He looked at me but I'm not sure he saw me. "Then he rushed out, leaving the door open." "Now the statement of the waitress from "Les Quatre Vents." "He downed four drinks, looked at the clock" "and seemed surprised that it was midday." Brambois was looking for you. He phoned. I was delayed. I couldn't go and see him. Are you mad at me, Delphine'? Why? You're not saying anything'? - I prefer you to be happy. - You don't think I am'? I have the best wife and a daughter whom I adore. A beautiful house, my business is doing amazingly well... I'm the happiest of men and anyone who says the opposite is lying! Did you receive those letters? No. Please. Hello, Julien. Take off the handcuffs. Your Honor, we weren't expecting a confrontation. Please take a seat, sir. Julien... Do you recognize this, Mme. Despierre'? I've already told you I do. It's your diary from last year. Do you confirm that the dates you saw Julien Gahyde are underlined'? - Yes. But on... September 4... I see a cross. - Could you tell me what it means? - It's the date of my first letter. Can you be more precise. Who did you write to on that day'? - To Julien, of course. - What for'? Ever since my husband appeared... I knew he was suspicious. You no longer put the signal out'? No. I didn't want Julien to make things worse. - Do you remember what you wrote'? - Yes. "Everything's fine" and I added "Don't be scared". You still deny it, M. Gahyde'? Let's continue. Perhaps you'll change your mind later. A second cross, September 25. - What said this second letter'? - The letters were never found. These statements only serve to compromise the person making them. It was just a greeting. "I haven't forgotten. I love you." According to your statement you wrote, "I haven't forgotten you". - No, "I haven't forgotten". - What hadn't you forgotten'? Everything. Our love, our promises. Article 287. October 10, or let's say 20 days before the death of your husband. During a previous interrogation, you gave us the text of a third letter. "Soon. I love you." What did you mean by "soon"? That we'd soon be able to see each other again. - Why'? Nicolas wasn't as suspicious. Not because you knew he wouldn't live much longer'? - She's already answered that question. - I've already answered that question. Answer it again. You know Nicolas was really sick... He could just as easily have hung on for years as die from an attack. Dr. Gelbard had told his mother that. - On what occasion'? - An attack. His attacks came more frequent. His stomach couldn't support the medication. He was losing weight. He wasn't fighting any more. Last time I asked you what the little circles mean that I see every month. I told you that's howl marked the dates of my periods. You admitted that with Mme. Despierre, you didn't take precautions like with other women. Mme. Despierre neither... Thanks to the little circles. 0K8)'- Let's go on. December 29'? "Our Happy New Year." Which means? I thought about it a lot. I wanted to say that this year would be for us. - You wanted to say you were free'? - You forget that Nicolas had died. And so in that case... there was nothing to prevent this new yearfrom really being yours'? Julien Gahyde's and yours. Yes. That leaves one letter, Mme. Despierre. "Your turn." Could you please explain to us exactly what you meant by that'? You don't find it clear'? I was free, you said so yourself. And you started putting the towel out again after your husband's death'? Once. Did your lover show up'? No. Did you go into the room'? I got undressed as usual, convinced that he would come. - Did you need to speakto him'? - Then I wouldn't have undressed. Was there nothing to discuss? Like what'? Like how he was going to get free. I don't see what's strange. People get divorced every day. We love each other. If I settled for marrying Nicolas it was because you had disappeared. When we saw each other again, we both knew we were meant for each other. So when you wrote "your turn"... You meant...'? That I was waiting for him. It was up to him to do whatever was necessary. - To ask for a divorce'? - Yes. And his wife? She wouldn't have cried for long. Didn't she love her husband'? Not like I did. Women like her aren't capable of real love. And her daughter'? Exactly. She'd have taken comfort in her daughter. Take Mme. Despierre away! Okay, take him out. Overview of the victim's body. Close-up of the face. Right hand with vomit. Trace of vomit on the left side of the mouth. A cellphone was found near the victim. A spoon with traces of jam. Good morning. - Good morning. - What terrible rain! I needed to come. Were you able to rest a little? A little. - Bring M. Gahyde up'? - Certainly. M. Diem'? Could you bring M. Gahyde up, please? Thank you. Right. You've left the hanger in the window, Your Honor. Thank you. And the shirt... Delphine Gahyde, 6 Plum, 6 Cherry. Come in. Good morning, gentlemen. Take off the handcuffs. How are you finding it being in custody'? Fine. I took advantage of the long weekend to review your file. From beginning to end. February 17... Could you give me a detailed breakdown of your activities... on that day. My wife woke up at the usual time... - And you'? - Me too, at 6:30. - You had breakfast together'? - Yes. You wake your daughter up, you have a shower, and you choose your best suit. - For my meeting with Garcia. - Yes, we'll get to that later. And then'? I think I've already told you, I was just getting into the car when my wife asked me if I could go and get... Suzanne'e eczema medication... from the pharmacy. She wasn't dressed. It would be easier for me. How long had it been since you were there'? Two months. Since the funeral. - How were you feeling? - Uncomfortable. You hadn't been back since the last letter'? The one with just two words, "Your turn". No. Who was in the pharmacy when you went in'? I remember a young boy, one of the Dutertre sisters... and an old lady. Was Nicolas' mother there'? I didn't see her. And? She immediately asked me, "What do you want, Julien?" I gave her the prescription. She took the medication off the shelf and said, "Just a moment, we've just received... the plum jam that your wife ordered... a couple of weeks ago." She disappeared into the back room and came back... with a small cardboard box... just like the ones Delphine often brought home. Did Esther Despierre seem emotional'? I avoided looking at her. She didn't say anything else? Yes, just when I was pushing the door open, she said, "Have a good day, Julien." It was a day like any other. So, you say your wife, who on this particular occasion asked you to pick up the medication and that, just by chance, a certain homemade plum jam, only eaten by your wife, had arrived at the pharmacy that very morning. It's made by a group of women, friends of Nicolas' mother. Delphine sometimes used to buy it. Inspector Mani noted that by chance you went to Fedex on that day. - I had to pick up a spare part. - What part'? A drive belt. You parked alongside the wall... of the warehouse, where no one could see you. No doors, no windows, a blank wall. It's the obvious place to park there. - How long did you stay there'? - I didn't check the time. The guard stated: "I remember he left the office, went straight to his car, which was parked behind the building, and he really took his time to... start up and leave. About 10 minutes. Well, I had to check they'd sent me the right part. - They often fail. - Did you open the package'? - Yes. - In your car'? - In the trunk. - Just that package'? - Yes. - Where nobody could see you'? Let me continue. Quite by chance... you go home, to leave your purchases there. And you told us your wife... was in the office, working. Did you kiss her before leaving'? No. And then'? You already know, I drove to Poitiers to meet with Garcia. - You didn't talk about your meeting... - To my wife, no! Explain yourself! For me, it was like coin flipping. You were pitting your family against Garcia by coin flipping'? If Garcia accepted, I'd sell. If he refused, I'd stay. He wanted to establish in the area. I'd leave him the branch offices, the clientele, perhaps even my house. Was he tempted'? He wanted a week to think about it. What were your plans if Garcia accepted'? Leave the area. Did you go straight back to SLJustin'? I drove really fast, I think it took me less than an hour. You saw the lights from a distance'? The house's lights were all switched on. Like never before. What did you think then'? About my daughter. Not about your wife? Compared with Delphine, my daughter was much more fragile. "You stopped your car about 20 metres from the house." "The neighbours had gathered around the driveway." "You had to force your way through them?" "I pushed the door..." "I wanted to open the door but it opened by itself." "The police officer greeted me, saying "This way"." - Where is my wife? - Yes..." Please sit down. - Do you have an ID'? - Yes. Where's my wife? And my daughter'? - Where do you come from'? - What'? He's asking for his wife. From Powers. - Why did you turn you cell phone off'? - At what time'? - Are you faking'? - No! - Where is my wife? - Calm down! Your daughter's with a neighbour. Anything else? Do you admit that you brought the jam'? Do you promise and swear... to examine scrupulously... the charges against the two defendants... Gahyde, Julien. Date and place of birth. October 25, 1969, at Triant. Your parents' names. Pierre Gahyde Harbreteau and Odette Harbreteau. Your profession at the time of the event'? - Pharmacist. - Farm equipment salesman. - Thank you, please sit down. I thought... it was from natural causes and that it was simply a sudden death. I think 98% of doctors... in those circumstances and knowing the patient's history... would have agreed. - Did you work in the blue room'? - Yes. In fact I cleaned... that room that day... and it was quite some work. Sorry. The relationship is quite simple, Julien has been in the area for about 4 years. Apparently he had some success, with his shitty shack! Personally, Your Honor, I consider him a criminal. He appeared as if he had just received a death sentence. He looked at me... Have you often seen people who... Don't interrupt the witness! You can ask your questions when it's your turn. Anyone can be shocked when they get a letter. After all he could be a tax collector. He's a good boss, very respectful with his employees, he works a lot, often late into the night. Normally pick-ups are at the front, but he loaded at the back. I'm in charge of packages to be picked up by car. Did he stay for a long time'? A long time... I don't know exactly but several minutes for sure. Julien's cellphone, was it on or off'? I remember that he turned it off when we sat down to eat. Yes, Madame Prosecutor'? How did he pay for the room'? We found no evidence of... In cash. It's in the account book, properly recorded. Very good. Thank you. I was in Triant for some shopping and I saw... the lady from the pharmacy go in... the back door of the Hotel de la Gare. Two hours later, I met her in the station... Please. - If you like... - Stand there please. "In this case, we were obliged to examine the internal organs" from the body of Nicolas Despierre. As for the hair, it's a routine test that we do in the lab... Here you see it again. The normal dose is 5 milligram and here we have 7. And that why I can definitely say it's positive. And so, we came to the conclusion, at least for our lab, that it was some type of digitalis poisoning, Your Honor. It is simply not possible in this case... to conclude that poison was used. Several elements to back up this hypothesis are lacking. - Good morning, Madam. - Good morning, Your Honor. Please state who you are. Despierre, Edvine. I was born June 6, 1953 in St. Justin. I'm a pharmacist and I live over the pharmacy. Very good. You weren't originally opposed your son Nicolas' marriage with Esther? No. But in fact I never really encouraged him. She was only thinking of our money. She knew his days were numbered. And when she took a lover... What was your reaction when you saw your son was dead'? I knew it wasn't from one of his attacks... and that his wife had had something to do with it. Of course... you don't have any proof'? Well no... I hoped that the wife would be next... his wife. And that's what happened, isn't it'? Talk to us about the package containing the jam. Who received it in the shop? I did, the previous day. The 16th I think. It was Brigitte who brought it to me. Did you open it'? No, I knew what was in it. I put it in the store room. On the morning of February 17, what time did you arrive at the pharmacy'? At 8:00, like always. - Did you see the package'? - Yes. It was still in the same place. - Still sealed'? - Yes. Tape still intact'? Yes! Thank you, madam. Thank you, Your Honor. Hello, Julien. They say the tape was intact! I don't know if the tape was intact!" You shouldn't even consider it... I don't know if the jar was changed..." "it's just an assumption..." "The law doesn't ask anything of the jury except that they respect life." "We don't have any... ...perhaps she wouldn't be dead." "Will you then condemn, Julien Gahyde," "for having poisoned his wife," "with the aggravating circumstance of..." I didn't poison my husband. But perhaps I would have done if he had taken too long to die. I loved Julien, and I still do. The prosecutor disagrees..." We love each other... ...it's rhetorical, to quote... No actual behaviour..." And finally tell them not to judge their love. Of course they won't judge their love! They have to judge an unfortunate man... The man claims not to know... Of course, it's the second hypothesis! Are you really sure you could spend your whole life with me'? - Definitely." "You're absolutely sure?" Wouldn't you be a bit scared'? Scared of what?" "Can you imagine how we'd spend our time?" We'd end up by getting used to it. To what?" "To the two of us." ...for having conspired... ...for causing the death of... Delphine Gahyde and Nicolas Despierre, the accused, Esther Despierre and the accused, Julien Gahyde to life imprisonment. You see, Julien, they haven't separated us... English translation by Nocturne
