Sister Ethel Elliott had the highest voice. The next voice down was Sister Lena Mae Perry, and their aunt, Sister Bennett, she had the lowest voice. And that was some beautiful three part harmony. They were consistent in the songs that they chose to sing, which were the old hymns. And they will put their little twist on it. And you knew, okay, this is The Branchettes. ♪ I can see my mother, oh ♪ As time moved on, Aunt Mae sort of drifted off from us, but Ethel and I kept singing. ♪ You know that sin has left ♪ ♪ A crimson stain ♪ ♪ Woo, child, He washed it ♪ When the Lord says move, feel like some fire get under your foot.

Shouting and foot stomping and clapping and praise the Lord, A church gospel noisy crew. - Try it, just try it. - Test a line or two? Okay. Can anybody talk about Wilbur without smiling? He loves to play piano. He loves music. Wilbur plays. He plays. ♪ You got to trust Him and give Him time ♪ ♪ Oh, no matter how long it takes ♪ Even as a small child, I saw pianos in my sleep. I think that was a message from God. ♪ Don't you worry ♪ ♪ I said He may not come when when you want Him ♪ ♪ But He's right on time ♪ We didn't do "Come By Here, Good Lord," did we? We have not done that one yet. Yeah, that one knows about "Victory's Mine." Yeah. And the other one, "I Don't Feel Noways Tired." 'Cause I'm still bumpin'. That's right. The first time I met her, we were singing within 20 minutes of meeting each other altogether. And she was teaching me parts. ♪ Ey, ey, ey, ey, Lord ♪ Anytime we're on a stage, no matter where we are, she will bring people to the altar. She will invite something out of people. She's taught me how to follow her. I love him. He can sing. And he falls in line with the rest of the children. Uh-huh. But when we wind it, we got to be sort of wide open, you know? - Oh yeah. - When we wind it. Yeah. I approached Sister Perry at one point about let's make a record together. Would you be willing to make a record with me? I love how she responded, "That'd be fine." ♪ Jesus is real to me ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ It changes there, but we do the same thing. ♪ Oh yeah ♪ You don't have to say, oh, then. You're down here. ♪ Real, real, Jesus is real ♪ Okay. Let's try it again. Angela Kent is one of North Carolina's absolutely foundational gospel singers. She's just a powerhouse, just a phenomenal singer. ♪ Whoa, yes ♪ ♪ He gave me the victory ♪ Angela has known Sister Perry for most of her life and her presence and her personality are just essential to bringing that third part. ♪ That is why I love Him so ♪ ♪ He's so real to me ♪ I love this. This is great. These aren't any of the tunes I wrote down and I love it. I just am totally into it. Once we decided it was a live record, we talked about a lot of things. What did you say? What did you play? We talked about honoring the other Branchettes, obviously, we talked about places and rooms she's been in her life and we would go back to, well, where does the name The Branchettes come from? Long Branch Disciples of Christ. It really makes me feel good when I come up in this driveway. Because this is my stomping ground. We had a wonderful family. We had singing parents, singing family. ♪ Were you there ♪ My sister, my brother and I, we made our own music in the yard, back up in a corner somewhere. I would have a shoe box and my sister had the foot tub. We laughed, we frolicked, we had a good time, but we knew what we had to do. At some points we had to fill up a barn of tobacco the same day. And it was a certain way that the tobacco had to go on that stick. Put it on that string and, oh, could I do it. ♪ Tremble ♪ ♪ Tremble ♪ ♪ Tremble ♪ We thought it was hard, but it wasn't. It was just part of life. My grandmother and my aunt were members here at Long Branch Church. There was elderly seniors that taught us so much. Three little kids knew what three-part harmony because we've heard it so much. We knew that we were gonna have to sing at church. They called us then The Bennett Three. We pops up, goes down there to the front of the church. And we would start singing. And they would be just, you know, clapping their hands and some singing along with us. And I heard, I heard my grandma say, "Tear it all to pieces!" ♪ Come on, you and me ♪ ♪ And have you ever seen a man like Jesus ♪ ♪ He's a mystery, a mystery ♪ ♪ Oh, have you ever seen a man like Jesus ♪ ♪ He's a mystery, a mystery ♪ As time moved on, they wanted us to be in a sunshine band, the little children's choir, okay? And they'd take us every weekend from church to church singing and we would sing our little hearts out. We were so glad to get in there. 'Cause the little choir that came from this church, we were bad. We were bad. ♪ Made the blind to see ♪ ♪ But then He remembered me ♪ ♪ But have you ever seen a man like Jesus ♪ ♪ He's a mystery, a mystery, oh ♪ ♪ Have you ever seen a man like Jesus ♪ Is that your senior picture? Senior class picture. - Okay. - I loved school. I really loved to go to school. And that is Lena Mae Bennett. Valedictorian class of 1957. Lena Mae Bennett, valedictorian. - Yes. We rehearsed in daddy's corn patch. And we start singing this little song that my, I think, my granddaddy had taught us, something like. ♪ We are rolling ♪ ♪ We are rolling ♪ Now, little bitty children. ♪ We are rolling in this unfriendly world ♪ ♪ We are rolling ♪ ♪ We are rolling ♪ When we got ready to get in daddy's car, we knew exactly where we were supposed to sit to make that harmony. ♪ We are rolling ♪ Coming on highway 70 towards Smithfield. We saw this sign and we had heard people talking about it, but it had three great big Ks: K-K-K. ♪ We are rolling ♪ With us being kids, We didn't really know what it meant. And we didn't talk about that. It was a sense of fear. There were some Klansmen in our community. Some families had told us, they was afraid to go outside. Somebody said they gonna come to their house. We couldn't do that much about it. All we could do was pray. ♪ We are rolling through this unfriendly world ♪ I hope this record finds people wherever they are, somewhere in their life in a crazy way. If it's the right person, it's gonna change their life. I grew up in a tiny town in Northern Wisconsin, called Chippewa Falls. And everyone went to confirmation on Wednesday nights and we sang songs like. ♪ As the deer drinketh for the water ♪ You know, and that's like, that was the vibe. I feel like music finds you and it either grabs you or it doesn't, so yeah, it's a little funny that of course gospel music came into me through the form of the movie "Sister Act." You know what I mean? I mean, that's just, if I'm being honest. ♪ Happy day ♪ ♪ Oh happy day ♪ ♪ Oh happy day, yeah ♪ ♪ Oh happy day ♪ A multitude of voices all together at the same time, like harmony, but not just like, ♪ Harmony ♪ Like harmony! You know? Just going like all those things shaking and vibrating at the same time, you know? Like, do I have a choice? No. ♪ Oh happy day ♪ Oh, oh my God. Oh, she looks so good. ♪ Hello ♪ - Wow. - Hey! - Hey! - Come by here. Come by here. - How's everybody? You look absolutely gorgeous today. Thank you, thank you. - How you doing? - Hi, sweetheart. - How are you doing, mom? - I'm good, how are you? - Good. - Good to be here. - It's good to be here. - Oh. Oh, a handshake, huh? Just a little handshake? - Yeah. Well, so what'd you think? I said, I didn't know we had to get all this stuff in this little place. I told Chris, the engineer. I said, "When they walk in the room, you hit record." 'cause when you get The Branchettes into a room, you never know what's gonna come up, and sure enough, Wilbur sat down and had recorded an entire album's worth of material in a half hour, it was the first thing that happened. ♪ Someday I'm gonna see my Lord ♪ ♪ Walk around the heavens, spread the news ♪ ♪ Put on my shiny golden shoes ♪ ♪ When my Savior calls me home ♪ ♪ Well, you'd better get ready for that great day ♪ ♪ There with my angels I will always stay ♪ ♪ Heaven's gates will open wide for me ♪ ♪ When my Savior calls me home ♪ Wilbur is really deep in music. I can think of a song. He can tell me exactly who sang it and the words. ♪ You must have the Holy Ghost ♪ ♪ If you expect to join the heavenly host ♪ ♪ Put on my shiny golden shoes ♪ ♪ When my Savior calls me home ♪ That's a good one. That's a great song, it was sung by the Walker Sisters of Raleigh, North Carolina. If there was the right promoter or something down in this area, they would have been pushed to the top a long time ago. Some people get breaks and some people don't. Oh yes. Hi sugar, how you doing? All right, "Walk The Streets Of The City," let's do one in G first. I thought I sung that in C because it was, you know, we had a little conflict over that one. - We got- - With this one? - Nope, sorry. Wrong key. - Na-ah, that's not it. No, it's not. Gotcha! - Is it G? Let's find out, what is it? Woo, hold tight. I told you to rest, easy does it. - Yeah, no, no, no. - Yeah, listen to mama. We've been. When you continue to, you gotta breathe everybody's got to breathe just a little bit. Yeah, yeah, you gotta breathe. Gotta catch their breath, that's the truth. Let me see, what key is that, G? - What was the name of the song you said? Oh, what I sung to you. Three years ago, I had problems with circulation on my left leg. So I had to have it amputated below the knee. Every key I hit encourages me to continue on. ♪ He was there ♪ Sing mom. ♪ All ♪ ♪ The time ♪ ♪ He was there ♪ ♪ He was there ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ All the time ♪ ♪ All the time ♪ ♪ He was waiting patiently ♪ ♪ Waiting patiently ♪ ♪ He was waiting patiently ♪ ♪ Oh, in line ♪ ♪ In line ♪ ♪ He was there ♪ It truly can be timeless. Music can transcend space and time. This record feels alive. You can feel this record and you can sit in the room with this record and it feels like you are there. Yeah. The God that put me here is for me to inspire people. And I pray and ask God, you know, "Lord, I'm working for You. Please open doors for me. Please." I prayed that prayer lots of times. ♪ We'll gather ♪ ♪ Around the throne, whoa ♪ - I love it. - That's very nice. - I love it, I'll tell you. - Yes, sir. This week, we got stuff to do. So tomorrow we got to go out to Long Branch. We'll be there on Friday. And then we're gonna be there on Saturday, we're gonna live at that church. You going back to Long Branch tomorrow? We're gonna get the sounds just right. Make sure the volume, because, you know, when I sing, I sing loud. So the microphone will have to. Oh yeah, we know. I don't wanna. That's why we're making this CD, you know, we're making this because you sing loud. I sing loud. "The Branchettes and friends at a nursing home in Dublin, Ireland." - I remember that. - Hmm-mm. Yes. - Yes. So mom, where were you guys in this photo? That looks like when y'all maybe first started. I don't even think. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's when we were really getting down to it. And that was an anniversary. That was the first anniversary, 'cause we had corsages. Oh! So this is like the first anniversary? Uh-huh, first anniversary. - Wow. - Yeah. This one is the closest one. This one says- 19. - 82. - 82. Okay. So that would've been your ninth anniversary. That's at the, isn't that at the Western Assembly building? And Wilbur would have been in this time or no? No. We was on a journey. we were singing at different churches. So we went to this church in Angier, North Carolina, right down the road. ♪ I can see the sun ♪ ♪ Peeking through the clouds ♪ ♪ Oh the storm is almost gone ♪ Wilbur came up to play for this church. When he put them long fingers on that piano, I said, "Ethel, that's the man." ♪ I prayed and I prayed ♪ ♪ Prayed all night long ♪ We'd be invited to oh, so many churches all over North Carolina, Saturday nights, Sunday mornings, Sunday evenings. We were gone every weekend. Travel, travel, travel, travel. ♪ Just couldn't rest until my soul ♪ Johnston County, and surrounding counties, are definitely known for strong gospel roots. For The Branchettes and other groups, it's your demand. It's your demand that you put on yourself, and then the demand that the people put on you. ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ God is the kingdom ♪ ♪ God is my friend ♪ ♪ God is ♪ A gospel choir anniversary is a celebration of another year that you have been steadfast, unmovable, doing the work of God. ♪ God is the captain ♪ ♪ God is ♪ ♪ Woke me up ♪ ♪ God is ♪ The attendance sheet will run from 12 to 15 groups each day. She had quartets, choirs, soloists, oh my goodness, it was so many groups. ♪ Lord, I thank You ♪ ♪ Lord, I thank You ♪ We started it here, but the church was too small. ♪ Standing ♪ ♪ Standing ♪ I know she has traveled far because of the support that she gets at her anniversary. Some of those groups traveled two hours and sang two, maybe three songs. But they traveled because they were gonna be in the midst of something remarkable. Every group, every person don't have that ability to give the people a ministry that they want, a ministry that they need and a ministry that they're going to hunger for. Cucumbers, an old tradition. Let me see, let me see. We learned a lot of this when we were at home and daddy grew his cucumbers. Wilbur will tell me sometimes, "Sister Perry." When he say it like that, I know it's something about cooking. He want me to tell him how to put something, what to put together. She would tell me exactly what to do and it'll come out right every time, I'm surprised she doesn't have Sister Lena Mae Perry's cookbook on the market. Get it all mixed up. Whip it up real good. And I got some of these little utensils that people, that lazy people use to keep from using their arm, you know? See, you just take time and do it, and it'll whip up. One of the previous chapters of Sister Perry's life, she owned a soul kitchen in Raleigh, called Mae's Country Kitchen. I cooked real meals. Not no sandwiches. I would go down there every day. I don't care if I was working in Cary. I would come back at 12 o'clock and eat at Mae's Kitchen. I had the little booths up and down the side of this wall. I had the little barstools and I could walk around and talk to each one of them. You see all kinds of people there, all walks of life. Some of them half drunk, but they would be there. I fed people. You don't know what they're dealing with. I talked their kinda language, something that they needed to hear, no negative mess. She could handle a congregation of hundreds of people, all of us hungry at the same time, all of us going into the fellowship hall at the same time, you knew that Mother Perry had put her love and her professional touch to it. If you didn't come back for the preaching, you sure came back for the food. She and her family share meals together several times a week, you know? And they are all grown and married and have their own lives and careers, but they dine together several nights a week. Their daddy started it and if they weren't here, especially by this time, he'd be on the phone calling every one of them. ♪ Here we go again ♪ He would look after those kids while I was gone and I stayed on the road. And he never ever said to me that you can't go. He made it possible. Even though she traveled a lot, she'd let people know, "I gotta get back home. I still am a wife and a mom." Sorry I'm late. You made it though. Well, he wanted to be sitting at the end of that table, facing his children, they laughing and talking and cutting up. Get a little bit of everything. ♪ Trying to get rid of all, all my sins ♪ Let's say a prayer. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this moment. We thank You for what we have accomplished this day. We thank You for us being a close, connected family. Thank you for being able to see my children about almost every day. Keep them safe if it is Your will. Now Lord, we are truly and thankful for what we are about to receive, for the nourishments of our bodies for Christ sakes, amen. - Amen. It wasn't too long, was it? It wasn't too long, we didn't have to get the offering trays out it was good. Yeah. - Regina has worked another, she could almost have ran the restaurant for me. Y'all pretty well knew what you're supposed to do. I knew how to clean the stove and I didn't wash many dishes. Sometimes I went back there to wash dishes just to get out of the front. Regina! Ain't nobody could be in the kitchen but mama. And still can't go in there now. Can't go in there now. Don't put nothing in the sink. Can't wash dishes. - Can't do nothing. Can't even walk in there. - Wilbur and Wilbur and- - Wilbur was here, yeah, Wilbur. - Wilbur was here, playing the piano, yeah. When you were a little boy and we had a piano in there. - Just running in here with me all of the time. I didn't care what note y'all was on, I was just gonna run right in. When all of those kids was young, I taught them to love everybody because I knew that in this life there's a lot of things you got to confront and you got to have enough faith and you got to be able to put enough trust in God that you can handle what comes up against you. In 1997, I lost my oldest child, Kenny. He was a smart child. He was so sweet and he really loved karate. And right out of high school, he went into service. He was overseas a whole lot. And when he come home, we would just be so overwhelmed, there come my baby. When he was sick, when they called me, I went to Germany. And I went to visit him. And they had this long board across there with different plugs in it. And my baby would have something in each every one of them plugs, trying to keep him. I never saw him move. I just sit there and watched. There's nothing like losing a child. You can't help but think about it and it hurts just like it happened yesterday. As we are born in the world, we don't know how we gonna leave. And I didn't want to question God, 'cause He's in control. And it seemed like when I begin to like trust God, I got a little bit of more ease. I said, God, You handle this. I can't handle this. ♪ I don't feel ♪ ♪ No ways tired ♪ ♪ I've come too far ♪ ♪ From where I started from ♪ ♪ Nobody told me ♪ ♪ That the road would be easy ♪ ♪ I don't believe He brought me this far ♪ ♪ To leave me ♪ ♪ I don't feel ♪ ♪ No ways tired ♪ ♪ I've come too far ♪ ♪ From where I started from ♪ ♪ Nobody told me ♪ ♪ That this road would be easy ♪ ♪ I don't believe He's brought me this far ♪ ♪ To leave me ♪ Y'all, I just got to say it again. ♪ I don't feel ♪ ♪ No ways tired ♪ ♪ I've come too far from where ♪ ♪ I started, started from ♪ ♪ Nobody told me ♪ ♪ That this road would be easy ♪ ♪ I don't believe He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe ♪ ♪ I don't believe, He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe ♪ ♪ He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe ♪ ♪ He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe ♪ ♪ He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe ♪ ♪ He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe ♪ ♪ He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe ♪ ♪ He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe ♪ ♪ He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe ♪ ♪ He brought me this far ♪ ♪ I don't believe, I don't believe ♪ ♪ He brought me this far ♪ ♪ To leave me ♪ - How are you, all right? - Hello. - Hey, Miss Mae. - Hello. - Hi. - Look at you, ooh, that's beautiful.

She's a God-fearing woman, you can look and count on her. Church is her middle name. Well, let me see if I'm gonna get me a snack. - Good morning. - Good morning. What a mighty God we serve. What a mighty God. We've come into this house gathered in His name. That's right. We may as well go on and give Him the praise. Hallelujah! My mama always told me, keep yourself prayed up. And that's what I do. - Anyone else? - Yeah. 'Cause the same God that's in the church, is the same God that's out there with me on those stages.

All the details with the feathers and that yellow will be pretty too. Oh yes. I don't know about that one, Lena. - Yeah. - I love this one. - Yeah, the yellow. - I love this color, yes. It's beautiful. So it's a hard choice. What would The Branchettes wear? You knew it was gonna represent the glory of God. Every woman was sitting there going, yes, celebrate yourself by the way you adorn yourself. They were ready now. I looked at my closet, had just about forgotten that I had this one. - It's gorgeous. And I said, oh my goodness, I'm gonna wear that dress today. I have put a whole lot of prayer in this project. And one of the things that would just thrill me so much, if in this service, with God being in charge, that somebody would just stand up in that congregation and tell God, "Thank you, I've been saved." People might not express it, but there's gonna be a change in somebody's life. That's what I'm working for. Let me lay them flat so they don't get any wrinkles. There's a song that we sing, "Please be patient with me, God is not through with me yet. And when God gets through with me, I shall come forth like pure gold, my gold digging is here.

She knew what I liked and she would cook some of that. And we'd pick the songs we were gonna sing together. That's what you call real true love. And she was comical. She could tell you something, she'd break out and start laughing. The Branchettes never forgot where they came from. They sung their roots and they sung a message to you. ♪ Oh, will You keep me, Lord ♪ ♪ Yes, Lord ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ In a pure ♪ ♪ Oh, I wanna live ♪ ♪ Oh, I want to live ♪ ♪ In a building ♪ Okay.

And even now, when we go somewhere to sing, I don't care where it is, I can always hear you in this ear. And it is so beautiful, that voice. You're still one of us, we'll never forget you. That S is still on Branchettes. When I went to visit Ethel in the hospital, I made a promise to her in her ear. As long as the Lord let me live, The Branchettes name will keep on going until I leave here. And that's what I'm doing. ♪ Come by here, good Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Come by here, good Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Come by here, good Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Yeah, oh, Lord, come by here ♪ ♪ Oh, come by here if you don't stay long ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Come by here, if you don't stay long ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Come by here, but don't stay long ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Yeah, oh, Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ There's someone that's in trouble, Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Somebody's in trouble, Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Somebody's in trouble, Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Oh Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Why don't You come by here ♪ ♪ Won't You come by here, Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Come by here, Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here, Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Come by here, Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here, Lord ♪ ♪ Come by here ♪ ♪ Yeah, Lord ♪ ♪ Lord ♪ ♪ Lord ♪ ♪ Lord ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Lord ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Lord ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Oh, come by here ♪ ♪ Lord ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ ♪ Oh yes, sir ♪ ♪ Thank you, Jesus ♪ ♪ Jesus, thank you, Jesus ♪ Thank you for all the week, for everyone that participated, for all of them that come out to do this for us for The Branchettes, and I thank God for that. I know God is pleased. I know those other two Branchettes are pleased. We're still carrying the legacy on. I've come too far now to turn around. Continue to give us that strength that we need. All our families, we need You in a time just like this. All our friends, we need you too. And even our enemies, we all need You. Now, God bless us. We shall be blessed. Reverend, will you please dismiss us? God, our Father. God, we thank You for showing up and showing out. God, we thank You for allowing Your Holy Spirit to rest, rule and abide in this place, God. Now God, after every song and every prayer, we've done all that was asked for us to do God. God, we ask that as we leave this place, but not from Your presence, that You take us over the dangerous highways and return us safely to our homes. And God let us find everything that we left better than it was, as we return, God. Now watch over us and keep us until we meet again. And we all say, amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen again. - Yeah. ♪ Let the church say amen ♪ ♪ Let the church say amen, whoa ♪ ♪ God has spoken ♪ ♪ Let the church say amen ♪ ♪ Would you mind saying it one more time ♪ ♪ Let the church say amen ♪ The Lord has blessed and kept us.

It's down to their heels. It's all through their bodies. It's so much bigger than them. They're not gonna retire. That's not how it works. They will do this until they are no more. - Bless your heart, doll. - Yes, you did. - How you doing, sweetheart? - You was awesome. And I just feel good too. Absolutely. There's an old hymn that I love called "A Satisfied Mind." Every time I hear that song, I think of Sister Perry. I love people. Because if I didn't love people, all of my running would be in vain and I don't want it to be in vain. Her whole life, she's strengthened the ties between human beings. They feel closer, they see each other because of the vast amount of love that is in her heart. That's just an example of what one person can do in one community, person to person day to day, song to song, over the course of a life. I want God to just keep and continue to elevate me. I refuse to give up. Now at 80 years old and He's brought me this far? I want Him to use me until He uses me up. Then I'll be satisfied. ♪ When we all see Jesus ♪ ♪ We will sing and shout the victory ♪ Hello? Hey, Mae. Hey, how are you? Yeah, me too, me too.
