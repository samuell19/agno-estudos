After making that dough he's not gonna let you spend, why shouldn't he? He loves you! I'm here as a friend, not as a businessman. Besides sweet, how are you, Reed? Took a streetcar instead of a cab. Saved a buck. He feels great. Rosie, quit it, please. I'm not even gonna speak about money. I promised myself this morning. I just came down to help you through customs. That's fine, darling. Only? You didn't exactly stick to the budget I put you on. You didn't expect me to live on $10 a week in Paris, did you? Why not? Paris is no different than New York. It's just Frencher. Come on. I've arranged to have customs go through your bags. Yes, I know. That's wonderful. Rosie, you look great. Wonderful. Yeah? Hey! Wait till I inherit those clothes! Appleton, if you could dig what this costs, you'd get indigestion from the lunch you didn't buy me. How was London? Oh, wonderful. How was Paris? Very exciting. Was your performance at the Palladium sensational? Oh, yes. Some French postcards you sent. The Eiffel Tower-- Come on. You'll be happy I managed to unfreeze your pounds and francs, transfer them into dollars-- Never mind. There's only one thing I wanna know. How is my house? Oh, all right. Here it is. The bill of sale. Yours. Lock, stock and barrel. The barrel was wholesale. Mmm! 121 Esplanade, Scarsdale, New York. Oh, it sounds good. This is all okay, Miss Laird. Thank you very much. Come on. Let's go. Oh, the keys. Thank you. Uh, I haven't been. I'm here already. Driver, take care of the bags, please. Well, how do you like it?

Just one of those nights. So I said to him, "Listen, honey, let's face it. "You're about as sharp as a wet blotter. Every time you open your mouth, you put your foot in it."

[ Coughing ] I want to talk to somebody. [ Man ] What's holding you back? Nothing's holding me back except you. You murderers. Look, I've got a new house. I'm giving a party. I've got people. I've waited for years for the house, the party and the people, and you're wrecking it. First, we're set upon by pigeons. Then we're knocked on our rockers by cinders and fumes! And now-- Look! We're being smoked out like hams in a market. Well, it's got to stop, or else! Or else. Or else what? I-I didn't have to be so mean. Oh, well, you weren't so mean. I didn't have to yell at you. It's all right. Makes you feel better. Well, anyway, I'm sorry. We're sorry too... about your party. I think this thing has stopped smoking. Well, it was your fault in the first place. Joe. That's something you say before somebody says they're sorry, not after. Oh. That's an awful pretty dress. Thanks. Say, how is it my fault? You were making way too much-- Just technically. We were asleep and the music woke us up. It woke the pigeons up too. They got curious and decided to see what it was all about. Don't you worry. As soon as we have our hamburgers, we'll go right back to sleep. Want one? We only made four, and Benny, Lowlife and I have eaten ours. That's right. No point in being too neighborly too soon. - Want half? - No, thanks. - Can I have a rain check? - Sure, anytime. Our name's Carter. I'm Bill, this is Joe, and that's Lowlife. I'm Jeannie Laird. How do you do? How do. Nice party? Wonderful. Gee, I've got to get back to it. [ Barking ] Uh, nice Jeannie. Nice, nice. Listen, he's the one who's barking, not me. Shh. Nice Jeannie. [ Chuckles ] Sit down. Jeannie Laird, this is Benny the Dip. How do you do? Shh. I've got to go. Cold? Cold. That was a pretty sappy thing you said-- That was a pretty dress. Why? It was. All the same. It's a good thing we straightened up the house a little. [ Jeannie ] Hey. Hi. Tell me something. Do you always sleep out there in the yard? Quite often. Doesn't your wife mind? Haven't got one. - She's dead. - Oh, I'm sorry. It's all right. It happened a long time ago, when he was a very little boy. Who takes care of him? I take care of him. Well, I help a little. If there's anything wrong with his manners or the state of his neck, blame me. You mean, you live here all alone, just the two of you? Yes, the two of us. And the pigeons, Benny the Dip, Lowlife, Moe the toad, Pete the turtle, Freddy the frog... and there's two garter snakes we haven't named yet. - We haven't found out if they're boys or girls. - You forgot Binky. Yeah, I did. He's the canary upstairs. Oh. Well, good night. Good night. What's she being sorry for us for? Well, women always feel sorry for men without women. Why? You should see how it is in the other kids' houses where they do have 'em. You gotta eat when you're not hungry. You gotta take baths when you feel like staying dirty. It's pretty gruesome. They think it's good for your character to do things you don't wanna do. I'm surprised men live with women so much. How is my character? I like it. Well, then. She's got a lot of nerve feeling sorry for us, hasn't she? Yeah. You wouldn't want one around, would you, Dad? Me? Nah. Just clutter up the place.

And you've read the Bayberry Room contract? Yes, the terms are just swell. [ Man ] Let's have a little action now, Jeannie. Whoop. Sorry. Watch it, Tarzan. What's the matter? I had a little accident last night. Ran into a fifth of scotch. Hungover? And back. Ah. What's with you? Well, I'm Bill Carter from next door. W-With the pigeons and the Indian smoke signals? Guilty. Hey, Jeannie. Look what flew over the wall-- the keeper of the zoo. Samuels will give you some coffee, boys. I'll be right back. That's a very good stock. The market is very bullish. Hi. Hi there. How are you? What can I do for you? I'll leave before he answers that. Oh. I've kind of an embarrassing question to ask you. Oh, I didn't think there were any left. See, I do a strip. What? I do a strip. I guess I heard you the first time. Oh. Oh, no. This is for the comics. You know, for the Express. Oh. Funnies. What I thought you meant was pretty funny too. Yeah, I can see that. Well, anyway, it's all about Joe and me and the whole neighborhood, and I'd like to use you in it. Me? Oh. Well, how? Well, the subject is "Who has bought the house next door?" Demons? [ Shudders ] No. Goblins? No. Giants? No! [ Laughing ] Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present to you the only jet-propelled... fairy princess in captivity. Oh, isn't that darling? But why am I jet-propelled? Well, it's 'cause everything you do is so fast. You know-- Whoo! You're here. Ffft! You're there. Do you always work that hard? You haven't seen anything. You should see me on a normal day. Like this coming Monday. I start rehearsals in the morning for a new show, and at night I open at the Bayberry Room for a week. What a life. What do you mean? I love it. Besides, everybody works. Why, I'll bet you draw millions of these every day. No. Just four little boxes just that big. What do you do with the rest of your time? You must be kidding. No. I have a son. He uses up all his time using up all my time. Have you ever been a father? No, I haven't. Well, it's a full-time job, believe me. You see, there's talks. There's games and school. Then there's the proper use of the "T" formation. How to keep your left hand up high. And then, of course, the art and science of washing behind the ears. Right now we're planning a vacation.

You'll see. I don't care. But why does he have to do it like this? It's just a big lie! That's terrible to have your father be a liar. Mine lies to me sometimes. Well, mine's lyin' to thousands and thousands of people. They oughta know about it. You oughta tell 'em. I couldn't squeal on him. Otherwise it'll just go on and on. You know how it is when you don't get caught. Kinda like cheatin' in school, huh? After a while, he'll get to be no good at all. Boy, I'll bet if his boss knew about that on the paper, he'd be plenty sore. That'd be good. He'd say, "You stop lyin' or I'll tell the people." That way I wouldn't be squealin' so much, would I? No, not much at all. Besides, if you put it in a letter, you wouldn't even have to sign your name. Hmm. I'll do it. Good. I have to go now. Thanks a lot, Kitty. You been real nice for a girl. Bye.

Robbing the United States mail. When you put a stamp on a letter and mail it, it belongs to Uncle Sam. It wasn't addressed to him. Who was it addressed to? Never mind. I just changed my mind after I mailed it. Why? I won't tell you, not even if you put me in jail for the rest of my life. Hi, Joe. Hi. What is it, Joe? I-- I-I mailed a letter to your boss. I told 'im you-- that you lied. Why? You said we were in Canada, and we aren't. That's a lie. I just didn't want everybody to know about it, so I tried to get it back. Why didn't you come to me? Talk this over? Isn't that the way we handle things? Well, it's different now. You're always with her. And even when you are with me, you never listen. And, well, I'm all mixed-up. Nothing's the same anymore. Kitty said you were stuck on her. That my name'd be mud and you'd be sending me off to camps and everything. Well, I feel funny all over. And nothing's the same anymore. It's all her fault, 'cause I hate her-- Joe! Joe, I want you to apologize to Jeannie. Tell her you're sorry and that you didn't mean it. I'm waiting. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. But I'm not sorry I said it. And I won't say I didn't mean it, 'cause I did. What'd you have to spoil everything for? Why don't you leave us alone? We were doin' okay, just the two of us! Oh, Joe. No, Jeannie, don't. We'll talk about this later. Thanks, Simon. That's okay. Thanks, Frank. Sure, Mr. Carter. [ Whistles ] Go in the kitchen, Son, and wait for me. I'll be in in a minute.

We're certainly not gonna not get married just because of it. That would be pretty ridiculous, wouldn't it? Yes. Yes, it would. Our little friend in there's just gotta be told. Nobody owns anybody. Everybody's gotta live their own life. It's gonna be rough on him, and I'm sorry, but I just can't sit back and let him live in a stall shower. Oh, no. No, he's got to learn, for his own sake. Oh, for our sake too. Look, he's my kid, and I love him, but we're important-- the rest of our lives, that's important too. It isn't as if he really hated me. Me personally, I mean. Of course not. No, he'd feel the same way about anybody in my place. Well, of course. There's no point in stalling. I'm just gonna go tell him. You and I are gonna get married, and the three of us are gonna live happily ever after. Only, uh, Jeannie? You think I might better wait until the morning? Maybe after he's had a... good night's rest? No? No. Get it over now, Bill. Bill? Hmm? Now, uh, what if he should, uh, get upset? You know, I mean-- Well, what if he cries? What if he cries? Well, I'll tell you. Then he cries. Joe. There are a few things I wanna say to you. Now, I know we have a lot of fun. We kid around a lot. But I'm still your father. Now in the first place, when I'm talking to you, I want you to look at me. Now, in the first-- In the second place. I think that you've behaved very, very badly. I shouldn't have written that letter. I don't mean the letter. I wouldn't have if it hadn't been for Kitty. You listen to a girl, you get into trouble. You've gotten into trouble because I said a lot of silly things. But you're the smartest guy I know. Joe, stop that! It won't work. I'm talking about Jeannie. You're talkin' about Jeannie, and we both know it. Quit horsin' around, or I'm gonna whale the livin' tar outta you! Bill, don't you dare say another word to that boy, not another word, or I'll never speak to you again. Why-- You can't just force me on him like you would castor oil. He can't help it if he doesn't like me. He'll get to like you-- Did you ever hear of anyone getting to like castor oil... just because somebody made a speech at him? You're the one who keeps saying-- I don't care what I said! You're not going to break his heart. I'm not breaking his heart! Poor little thing, sitting here crying. He is not crying! He would have been if I hadn't stopped you bullying him. I'm the one who's too soft? Fine tough-hearted character you turned out to be. Wanna make something out of it? No, you're making enough mess for both of us. Who's making the mess? Whose fault has it been right from the beginning? Mine! I admit it. Now I wanna do something about it, you won't let me. So who's wrong now? I am! Feel better? No. Good. I'm not gonna marry you unless Joe wants me to. That's insane. There's no way that won't take years. Stop yelling! I am not yelling at you. You're just acting like a darn fool. [ Sighs ] Go draw yourself a picture. Night, Dad. Good night, Son. What's the matter? Hmm? Oh, nothin'. I'm sorry I was so rough on you. Oh, that's okay. You know, you can't teach an old dog new tricks. A fella gets an idea he can change, but it isn't smart. Better stick with what you know. Yeah, sure. What are you fidgeting about? Huh? Nothing. You outgrowing your shorts again? No. We were getting along fine. We never needed anybody else. Dad, you don't mind, do you? I got a date to go see a show. You got a date? Who? A pal. Who? Kitty.
