[grand music playing] [stone grinding] [projector chugs] [dramatic music playing] [tense music playing] [intense music playing] [electricity buzzes] [mysterious music playing] [up-tempo music playing] Come on. We've been on the road for two whole days at this point. Who do you keep looking for? Well, we just pissed off some pretty powerful people. Shut the fuck up! - Shut him up! - Pretty boy. - [spits] - Tough guy, huh? [grunts] Not so fuckin' funny now, huh, tough guy? People who are all dead now, right? [both groaning] Yeah. They're dead as can be. Trust me on that. [grunting] [exhales] Sometimes it's better to leave the past in the past, Dallas. Trust me on that. [Lemmy] How long before the shipment arrives? Hour, hour and a half, tops. I want this cleaned up before they get here. [Sully] Yeah, I got it. I'll handle it. ♪♪ Maybe he's a cop, or maybe he's with the feds. Nah, he ain't with the law. No law would do what he did. Well, sometimes the past has other ideas. Let me take care of this piece of shit before the shipment comes. What the fuck? You know, before you leave us, I need to ask you some questions. Because not just anybody could walk in here and do what you did. [tense music playing] [grunts] [groans] [man yells] [both grunting] Shit. ♪♪ Hello? No, don't, don't. - Let me get you out of here. - What? Let's go. The other girls, I think they're dead. You have to arrest them all! Where are the other officers? I'm alone. And I'm not a cop. Please! [tense music playing] Hello? Are you okay? Miss, are you okay? Miss? Hey. You okay? Okay, okay. I'm here to help you. Don't worry. Come, come, it's okay. We need to go, now. We'll be fine. [up-tempo music playing] [liquids bubbling] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! This shit is flammable! Get the fuck outta here! What are you doing? No, no, no! - [glass shatters] - [man screaming] - [fire blazing] - [man screaming] [snickers] Is that a backwards compliment? I'm glad to see your spirits are high, man. Because guess what? This is going to fuckin' hurt like hell. [torch blazes] [Dallas] Ooh. Whoa. Just tell me what you want to know. What? I never said this is some big secret. I want you to know who I am, and why I'm here. And... I don't care if I die. In fact, I'm exactly where I want to be right now. So instead of getting all cute with your little torture kit, you should be thinking to yourself, "Why didn't I just walk down the fire escape?" This guy. Oh, yeah. I know about it. Back of the building, third floor stairwell. Rest. I got this. I know you do. [mellow music playing] [keypad beeping] Hey. Hey, we need to talk. Got a little problem here. ♪♪ Fuckin' unreal. Well, it's good to know you're still an asshole about it. [alcohol patters] You want a sip, buddy? Just trying to loosen you up a bit, increase your odds, help you get laid. Who the fuck is this guy? You just gonna let him say that? - [exhales] Ah. - [scoffs] Antano. Hey. Roberts is dead. Yeah. Uh, look, I've known the guy from, uh, since the academy, right? So, at this point, I'd say it's a-- it's a pretty safe bet. - Right. - Well, we're gonna need to wait for, uh, dental records to be completely sure, but his badge, ID, and some personal belongings were on the body. Yeah. Always thought the guy was a bit of an asshole. Especially when he had an empty stomach. But nobody deserves what happened to him. Sounds like somebody's trying to cover their tracks, tie some loose ends. That's disgusting. Can you zip that shit up? Any hits on the bullet from Dallas Ultio? Uh, nothing yet. Mm-hmm. Well, we would, if we could track 'em down. Right, right, right. Sugar. Text me your address right now. I'm on the way. And you might wanna-- Thank you. Do security detail on his partner, all right? Yeah. [Moore] We would, if we could find him. So maybe it's Lenwood cleaning up the loose ends. Put a BOLO out on him as well. [mysterious music playing] [rings] I need a room for the night, please. What are you doing? Right now? Honestly, trying not to piss and shit my pants. Yeah, well, if it's all the same, I'd like to avoid that. What do you need? More? No. No, no, no. That right there, that's more than amazing. Oh... You're too kind. You're too kind. Yeah, I... I wish that were true. Listen, I've known Detective Roberts for a long time. Long enough to know that that guy's still dirty and in with the wrong crowd. What's the problem? Well, you know, the locals think his partner's in on it. Look, at the end of the day, who pulled the trigger doesn't really matter at this point. What matters is, I've been hearing some noise over here. Is there any way to quiet him down? Not this time. Look, I've called in every favor I can around here, but this Dallas character has put Lars in a really bad spot with the bikers and the cartel. Dallas's days are numbered. So, what do you suggest I do? Might not be anything you can do. But if the guy signing your paycheck wanna talk to him before he ends up in a body bag, I'd make whatever move you got left, and make it now. - Shit. - [phone beeps] [swallows, exhales] [sighs] Can I get a refill? Hey, you know, Sergei, if you keep up with this shit customer service, I'm gonna have to go somewhere else. It's Ivan. And, yes, please. I'm begging you, go! Go somewhere else. [mysterious music playing] This one's yours. I'll be close by if you need me. How close? Close enough, so that if you need... Wait... [sighs] I shouldn't. What? I thought you want it. I do, but... But there's someone else? [sighs heavily] It's complicated. Yeah, it always is. You... You deserve better. Did she let you go? I say we both do. Get some rest. I'll be back in a few hours. I'm guessing you being here at this hour isn't on account of anything good. Do you know if he's okay? It's a safe bet that you've known him a lot longer than I have. You tell me. Only time I worried about him was the first time I met him. He was just a kid then. A broken, scared kid, fresh outta juvie. So full of rage and anger. So venomous towards anyone. Everyone. I was worried he was gonna get himself locked up for good, or dead. How did he get rid of it? All that anger? He didn't. Anger's still very much a part of him. Probably always will be. But now he knows what to do with it? That's right. Now he knows who to bite with all that venom. Forgive me for overstepping boundaries, but I'm guessing you sense that part of him. That's what attracted you to him. Why you need him to be okay. I'm also guessing that you got a lot of that venom in you, too. I think I liked it better when we weren't talking about me. Yeah. People filled with venom usually do. [tense music playing] Huh. [laughs] I'll leave you to your privacy then. Oh, one more thing. I know where to find you if need be. You can best believe that shit. [creaks] [engine revs] What the fuck is this crime scene? - [phone beeping] - Come on. Son of a bitch. Of course. Why the fuck would the phone work when I need it to? [breathes out] [hard rock music playing] [silenced gun fires] [grunts] - [phone beeps] - Yeah? [man] He's a federal marshal. I want him out of commission, not dead. - Understand? - Copy. You're good to go on Dallas. [car door slams] [phone beeps] [Blue] Dallas. I told you if you did this, we face the wrath of the cartel. You're my eyes, an extension of me. You destroyed our top cover by going rogue. When going home, you need to watch your back. We didn't have a choice. You and I both know that. Remember, we're answerable to merit. Taking out the bikers will draw the attention off the cartel. Lars is unanswerable to the cartel. That sadistic fuck will be coming at us hard. By the way, have you heard from Iris? Nah, I haven't heard from her. I'll let you know if I do. Watch your back. [buzzing] [bell rings] [clears throat] [bell rings] [clerk] Oh... About time you guys showed up. I called you like an hour ago. - Yeah, busy night. - Yeah. I bet. So, uh, what's up with this reward? The guy checked in here? Uh, yeah, this guy? - Yeah. - Checked in here about an hour ago. Okay. What room? Well... I mean, it says there's a reward for any information. Reward? Right, of course. Um, yeah. Why don't you step outside for a minute? - I can get it right to you. - Outside? Yeah, just some paperwork I need you to fill out. Shouldn't take too much time. Ah, why not? [laughs] It's dead tonight. [laughs] Oh, man. This job's a joke. I know you know what I'm talking about. - [laughs] - Yeah, you got it. [bell rings] Fucking idiot. There we go. [keypad beeping] Hello? Yeah. Yeah, we got him. [tense music playing] [buzzing] [car doors slamming] I believe he's alone. Room 104. - Good work. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Absolutely. So, what's the plan? What's next? [body thuds] Guys, alive. [tense music playing] [screams] What the fuck is this? How the hell did you get in my room? Who the fuck are you? That's Martin Inlex. And he was more than happy to switch rooms with me, after I was kind enough to put him up for a few days. Thank you, Martin. You're welcome? I think? You'll be okay. Just stay in the bathroom, close the door, and I'll take it from here. [men grunting] ♪♪ [bottle shatters] What the-- - [gun clicks] - Unfortunately for you, it's actually just one fucking guy and one badass chick. Look, bitch. Why don't you just put down the gun before... [Dallas grunts] - [breathes heavily] - [blood drips] Trish. Trish! [somber music playing] Hold on. I've got you, it's okay. I've got you. I'm here. Oh... I'm sorry. No. For what? I don't think I'm going to be able to go on the next one with you after all. No. Don't ever apologize. Never. Thank you. It's going to be okay. Trish. Trish... [exhales] [tense music playing] You were wrong. You'll be with me on the next one. Count on it. And the one after that. And the one after that. You'll always be with me, Trish. [Moore] Hey! What the hell are you doing? I'm a cop. You're gonna kill a fuckin' cop? Eventually. That's the plan. But first, I'm gonna need some information. What you need is to go fuck yourself. - You motherfucker! - [groans] She didn't deserve to die. Not like that. And not by someone like you. What the hell are you doing? Oh, I'm gonna right another wrong. I'm a fucking cop! - Do you hear me? - You're a dirty cop! - [Moore groans] - [gasoline splashes] You're gonna fry! You fuckin' hear me? You're gonna fuckin' fry! Fuck. - Who sent you? - [laughing] I think you already know, buddy. You have no idea how badly I wanna see you go up in flames. So this is your last chance. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, just... Just take it easy, okay? It was Lars. Lars. It was Lars. He wanted us to find out who you were working for. And if you couldn't? The phone, front pocket. He wanted me to show you the video, just in case you needed some more convincing. Wait. Wait! Come on, man. I told you what you wanted to hear. - Don't leave me like this, - [lighter clinks] they'll kill me if they find me. Please. [clinks] Fuck you! [screaming] You fucker! [continues screaming] [Trish on recording] Dallas, I opened the envelopes. Both envelopes. This was never about money. I know what we are up against. I am here for you. I care deeply. Perhaps one day you could share with me what has given you so much venom. All right. Fill up, quick look at the map, then we're off. What's so funny back there? [Dallas chuckles] You, Daddy. [chuckles] At least someone thinks I'm funny. I think you're funny too, dear. And incredibly handsome. Ew! Gross! Gross? Gross? [both chuckling] [car honking] Fucking tourists! Get the hell outta the way! [car honks] Unbelievable! I'm going, all right? Calm down. [car honks] Don't worry, Dallas. It's not a big deal. [motorbike rattles] - What the fuck? - Hey, man, calm down, it's all right. - Everything, hey-- - No, roll down the fucking window! - I'm sorry. - Don't roll it down. Let me-- Listen, I'll get my insurance information. - Open the window! - What are you going to do? Don't worry, son, everything is gonna be all right. - No! Open it! - It's all right, man, calm down. - [biker grunts] - [mom gasps] [grunting] Please, no! My son is in the car. - [mom speaking Spanish] - [grunting continues] - [mom] Baby, baby... - [grunts] [dramatic music playing] [phone beeps] Blue. I need to find Lars. We need to finish this. I'm going off book. Put me in touch with the Yellow Cab. [tense music playing] [grunting] [sighs] [grunts, sighs] [groans] Hey, Sergei. How about a food menu, yeah? How many times do I tell you? It's Ivan. And you know we have no kitchen here. You Americans... You wonder why everyone hates you. How can you hate me? I'm here day and night. In fact, I'm the only one that's ever here. I don't know how the hell you keep the doors open. [door opens] [grunts] Huh. [Patrick] I'm guessing you guys aren't here for the fried pickles. No, Patrick, we're not here for the fried pickles. But... [exhales] Don't worry, you've done a lot of stuff for me. All right? Uh... And you've cleaned up a lot of my messes. [vibrating] You gonna get that? - No. - [phone vibrates] Hey, it's me. Look, shit just went sideways. Tried to call you earlier, but I was in the middle of fuckin' nowhere. Had to walk a couple of miles just to get this service. I'm headed to you as quick as I can, but you need to get the fuck out, now. So, what can I do for you? [chuckles] What? Come on, man. You're staring at me like you wanna give me-- [screams, groans] Not so fuckin' funny anymore, is it, buddy? Huh, Patrick? [groans] How does that fuckin' feel now, motherfucker? This isn't necessary, I'm just a fuckin' hired hand. Hired hand. Yes, you are. Singular hand, because you won't be using it as much. What do you think, guys? That was a funny joke, right? That was a funny joke, huh? [laughs] Wasn't that a funny joke? Teddy. Wasn't that a funny joke? Sir, I've never seen anything like that before. That's why I enjoy working for you. [Lars] What do you think, though? It's funny though, right? Absolutely, sir. L-O-L. We'll see you around buddy, okay? Let's go, guys. This idiot thinks he can play both sides. Fuckin' informant. You're a funny guy, man. You never learn. [phone beeping] - Riley, it's me. - Where the hell are you? That's a good fuckin' question. But I'm gonna need a ride. - [groans] - [man on video indistinct] - [woman on video groaning] - [man laughs] There she is. It's amazing how they can doctor video footage today. - [tense music playing] - [Iris sighs] When he gets here, he's gonna kill you. You know, when you get that little anger streak, you look really beautiful. Really beautiful. The sooner this is over, the better. I'm just waiting for all this to be over. Yeah, I'm waiting for it to be over, too. Um... This guy has been a big fucking problem. I mean, all the people I deal with, the biker gangs, the cartel. Them supplying services that they can't do right now. And they don't want to hear about these problems, at all. Okay? I'm gonna find out who the fuck he's working for, and then I'm gonna kill him. For all intents and purposes, you-- you've moved on anyways. I mean, unfortunately, he has not. Mm. At no point have I ever indicated that I've moved on. Then you're a really fucking good actress then, aren't you? I did what I had to do. Nothing more. And the sooner this little charade is finished, we can stop pretending that this was ever anything more. I never pretended with you, ever. Not once. How much longer, Lars? Any minute. Any minute now. - Any minute now? - Yeah. Then we can go. We're free to go? Both of us, together? I'm gonna miss the hell outta you. I really am, but-- but, uh... I keep my word, Iris. You'll be free to go. You have my word, Iris. You have my word. - Here's to, uh... - [glass clinks] Freedom. Couldn't come soon enough. I made a living driving tourists around all the hot spots. So forgive me for saying this, but you... Why do you want to go out there? There's nothing out there. That's where I need to go. Listen to me, my friend. Nothing good happens out there. Ah, so I've been told. Then reconsider. Listen, enough already. I don't have time for this. Why do you care what I do? Just drive the damn cab. Because I have a daughter. Had a daughter. I'm sorry. Thank you. I personally know what you're walking into, because I tried it myself once. But I'm a simple cab driver. You, you are who you are. Still, you should give yourself a chance against the monsters, instead of going in there unarmed. Yeah, well, I didn't exactly have time to prep for this trip. That's okay. You have cash? Yeah. [mellow music playing] I did good, huh? Yeah, this should help. [Patrick] All prices are negotiable too, especially since you're a referral from a friend. Thanks. May I? Go right ahead. Top of the line. I mean, you're gonna take care of me too, right? I mean, like we discussed? Of course. All a man has in this world is his word. What happened to your hand? Minor accident. Yeah? Seems like a lot of people around here are having issues with their hands. [Patrick] I'll be fine. I'm sure you will be, but you should really be more careful in the future. I usually am, but... sometimes unexpected things catch us by surprise. Yeah. I know the feeling. I guess now's probably a good time to tell you that I'm sorry. I'm still careful enough to make sure none of those guns are loaded. Gentlemen! As promised. A few calls to the cab drivers, here's your guy. So this sets me straight, right? With Lars? Because I'd like to keep my other hand, you know? [chuckles] Ah, maybe put some coin into my pocket. You wouldn't believe how far on a limb I went for this. I mean, so far, that-- For fuck's sake, Curly. You promised no messes. My name is Chewy, cocksucker. I guess now's a good time to tell you that I too am sorry, because I didn't make the same promise. And to also let you know that... I don't need them to be loaded. [both grunting] [grunting continues] If you want to live, you'll tell me where's Iris. Fuck you! - [grunting] - You were saying? I don't know where the fuck she is. I swear, please. - [bone cracks] - [groans] I believe you, but that means, unfortunately, you're useless to me. So, fuck you, Curly! - [arm snaps] - [yells] Ah, don't worry, Dallas. I'll take you to Iris. And when I do, I'll be collecting a hell of a lot of reward money. Maybe be able to finally retire from this bullshit. [bullets clacking] Where the fuck have you been? I've been trying you for hours. I've just... been busy. My apologies. Well, I'm glad to hear you're still alive. I was just about to say the same thing about you. Yeah, well, honestly, I wasn't sure it would be the case there for a while. Listen, you at the bar? I'll come to you right now. - [Patrick] Hmm. - Yeah. So, any update on our boy Dallas? - No sign of him. - [device beeps] But Lars is still definitely hot for him. Word on the street is, he's offering five million for anyone who can bring him to him. Well, that's a whole lot of reasons, isn't it? Convince somebody to do something they know they'll end up regretting. Guess there's only one way to find out then, right? Well, no. I think most people would draw the line at being set up to be killed. Isn't that right, old friend? I hope to talk to you soon, friend. But I have to go. - Keep him, keep him, keep him. - Patrick, don't do it. He-- - God damn it! - Come on. - Not long enough. - Shit! Well, good news... Ah, you had him on long enough to get an approximate location. Well, bad news, it's in the middle of the fucking desert. What about the drone surveillance? The heat sensors? - Already on it. - What's the ETA? About an hour? [tense music playing] I have something the boss is gonna wanna see. He's still alive. Tell Lars I want my money. You can tell him yourself. - He's here? - And expecting you. ♪♪ What the... [Lars over speaker] I was starting to think this day would never happen, Dallas. Lars? I'm here now, so let her go.

And the guy sitting next to you is Patrick Taylor. That's Special Forces, he'll do anything for money. Just give him the time and place, and he'll be there. The thing is... You can't trust somebody who's not loyal. You just can't. You have to prove to me that you will do anything and everything for Iris. And I mean anything. I want you to shoot that motherfucker.

Ah, let's face it, no one ever wants to see themselves as the bad guy, right? Oh, I so wish you were under that hood right now. - What? - [sighs] Oh, never mind. Hey, take it easy. You got a nice crack on the back of your head. - [sniffs] - It's water. Lars is a glorified middle man for the biker gangs and drug cartels. For whatever reason, you've been going across the country really fucking up business, which leaves that glorified middle man in a bad, bad spot. Well, I know why I'm here, but why are you still alive? Honestly, your guess is as good as mine. Best guess, that sick fuck Lars wants to kill me himself. - [gate creaks] - Let's go.

I got nothing to tell. Yeah, whatever you say, man. The point is they'll be back. And eventually, no matter what, you'll be dead. We'll both be dead. I'm waiting for that, but... Look, my head is fucking killing me, so if you can just get to it, that'd be great. [exhales] But if you trust me... [tense music playing] Hey, I'm taking a leap of faith here trusting you too. But if you wanna get out here alive and save Iris, - then I suggest-- - What did you say? How'd you know about Iris? What? I never mentioned her to you. Look, why do you think I brought you here?

I don't know, Lars. You could've killed him when you had a chance, but you decided to be a walking, talking bad guy cliché. Oh, yeah. And then what? What do they do? They just replace him with somebody else. That's all they do. We're all just playing a part in this little story here. And you. - This damsel in distress. - Yeah, and who did that to me?

Where-- She's safe, okay? She's safe. She's with a friend of mine, okay? No Johns, no guards with guns, okay? Just the two of 'em? Just hold on one second, okay? [phone beeps] Hey. Yeah, look, um, bring the girl out front. Now! - Lars. - Look... - Sarah will be outside, okay? - Okay. You're both free, okay? - [exhales sharply] - I made a promise to you. Thank you, Lars. [sobs] - I'm so sorry. - [sobbing] I'm so sorry. [sobbing continues] [knife clangs] [wailing] [gate clanking] ♪♪ [Dallas] Iris. Dallas. Oh, my God. You're here. Oh, thank God you're here. - You okay? - Yeah. Where's Lars? As soon as he found out Dallas was on the outside of that door and the authorities had breached, he took off. He's gone. - Gone? - Yeah. Oh, this is bullshit. Dallas... - [grunts] - What's wrong? He works for Lars. That motherfucker! - No! Dallas! - [grunts] I almost died playing my part in this. And for what? Lars to run off with my money? Huh? [screaming] I'm really sick of you people! - [screaming] - [grunting] [heavy breathing] [knife clangs] Oh, God. My God, Dallas. - It's okay. - It's not okay. Hey, look. I want you to go all the way to the end of the tunnel, all right? That's where your mom is gonna meet you. - She'll be there. - Okay. Okay? It's all right. Just go. - [Dallas groans] - Dallas. Oh... [mutters] Okay. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. - It's all right. - No, no. Listen to me. I... I did what I had to do. He-- He gave me no choice. He had my daughter. Your daughter? Is she okay? Yeah. Yeah, she-- she's okay now. Is she... Is she mine? Oh. [breathes in] Oh, God, I wish she was. - Mom! - Sarah! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, honey. Oh, are you okay? - Fine, I'm fine. - Okay. Look at me. Look at me. Did they hurt you? Mom, I'm okay. [exhales] Okay. [groaning] [gasps] She has nothing to do with this. You guys go see what's down that hall, please. Get her the fuck outta here. [exhales] It's okay. It's okay, yeah. Dallas! It's gonna be okay. Listen to me. She's innocent. They're both innocent. I promise, you got nothing to worry about. Put a jacket on her, would you? I need your word. Both her and her daughter need safe passage to some place where Lars will never find her. [Antanto] You got my word. That word's backed up by the U.S. government. How's that sound? You like that? [sighs] Thank you. Welcome. What about Lars? Well, we're still looking for him, aren't we? I imagine he's spent the last handful of years planning an escape the last minute though, wouldn't you? I doubt we'll find him. Definitely not here. - I'm gonna... - [Antano] Gotcha. And you know he's not entirely wrong. But I promise you, I will catch that motherfucker. [sighs heavily] So I guess... [sighs] this is the part where you bring me in. So let's get this over with. I see. You never had any intention of bringing me in, at least not alive. Well, you are right in that regard, Mr. Dallas. We never intended on taking you in. And I've seen enough of what you're capable of doing to know that getting in a fight with you is probably not the best idea. [phone beeps] Got him. No, I am not shittin' you, I'm looking at him right in the eye. I tell you what, how about I put you on speaker? You can chat with him yourself. Hello? Bringing you in was never part of the plan. Voner? At least not to the authorities. Voner, what's going on? Where's Blue? Blue's okay, don't worry about him. I see things went a little sideways, thanks to Lars and Iris. But there's still a lot of work to do. [tense music playing] Listen. This has nothing to do with Iris. Blue's always done right by you, Dallas. By you and me. And what you two guys built together still remains. Nothing's different. The only difference is, you don't have to do it alone this time. I'll be around to assist in any way needed. I work alone. Well, now you and I both know that's not exactly true. Maybe it was a good thing that you and Iris reconnected. Who knows? No, no. Not after what happened to Trish. I can't. We know what happened with Trish, and it's not your fault. I'm not gonna let you beat yourself up over that. At least not as long as the... the person who killed your father is still out there. Now, listen, I want you to take your time, Dallas. Think this over. Don't make any decisions right away. You could even talk to Blue first. And I don't want you to come in. Got a little loose end I'd like you to take a look at, - if you don't mind. - Right away. Hell, I'll cut a loose end. You came across a couple detectives of ours. Detective Roberts, Detective Lenwood. Is that right? Yeah, what about them? Well, we just had a body turn up, and it was preliminarily identified as Detective Roberts. Well, his partner, Detective Lenwood, is the prime suspect in the murder. And you buy that? [chuckles] No, I don't. 'Cause I don't even think Detective Roberts is dead. [Voner] I'll see you soon, Dallas. In the meantime, I have a few loose ends of my own to tie up. [grunts] Ah, yeah. Thanks. [exhales] Is he in a good mood? Ah, you know, always the same. - [nurse] You're good. - [Boris sighs] Can you, uh... Oh. Can you excuse us for a bit? [nurse] Of course. You know what, ma'am? I breathe better without it. How about that? - [grunts] - How you doin'? You okay? What the fuck kind of question is that? You know what this is? I have to breathe in that so many minutes a day, or they say I'll be dead, but I'll never be dead. What happened with the appeal? And Dallas? Well, he did everything that Blue asked him to do. As always. You know what Ultio means? Revenge. And you know what the blind man did? He made a weapon. He made a weapon. And the problem is, he can't control him. So you and I, we are gonna have to take control. I'm already moving on that. And we have full support of the government. [laughs] - Really? - Yeah. You don't have anything else to say to me? Yeah, I do. We had a little complication. - How was that? - With Lars? He escaped, he got away. Ivan! The man needs ice. More ice. I know you have an ice pick, Ivan. Why don't you stab it three times and bring him three pieces of fucking ice for his drink? And we even did everything we could. We... We actually used Iris as bait. I didn't sanction that. I thought it'd be a good idea, and it worked. Well, don't ever tell him, because we sure as hell don't want that weapon turned around at us. Or we're done.
