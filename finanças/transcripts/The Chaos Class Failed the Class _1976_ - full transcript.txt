THE CHAOS CLASS FAILED THE CLASS THE RASCALS CLASS FAILED THE CLASS Teacher Mahmut! Welcome. - Don't mention it, thank you. - How are you? I'm good, thank you, Hafize. How are you? I'm great. Seeing you made me even better. If you had come 10 minutes ago you would have made it to the opening ceremony. Now everyone's in class. Anyway, let me make you some coffee. Thank you. Vacation was good for you. I put your belongings away... ...but we were expecting you yesterday. Here you go. It didn't happen. I could only come today. Hafize, what is Kemal's photo doing here? Ah, you didn't hear the news. Kemal teacher passed away. Oh! May God have mercy on him. So, what's this stove doing here? The furnace is broken. The principal had heaters placed everywhere. Yeah? What's all this noise? How should I know? A lot of new students joined the school. It sounds like they're not going to make anyone long for the Rascals Class. - That's right! Long live general Nuri! Oh, Teacher Mahmut! Let me down you scoundrels! How are you? Are you doing well? I'm doing very well, thank God. How are you doing? Thank God, Thank God. Look, look at your students. What are you all looking for here? Did you come to visit your old school? Based on what I've heard, the university exams were quite difficult this year. Well, let's hear what schools you all got into. Or... could you not get in anywhere? None of you!? Ah... very well then where are this year's students? Did you lock the helpless students up somewhere? We are this year's students, sir. Did you all not graduate? What were those diplomas you brought to the hospital? We thought the best present we could bring you in the hospital would be our diplomas. We studied hard to pass the exam, but we couldn't get through the tests. Instead of coming empty-handed, we each made a fake diploma. I understand... Why don't you just say that the Rascals Class failed the class? Well, well! Who is this here? Welcome, Mahmut. Thank you, sir. Get well soon, Mahmut, get well soon. Oh! Welcome, welcome! I missed you, my dear friend. Thank you, Mr. Riza. Mahmut, let me introduce you. This is our new chemistry teacher. We know each other sir. We were basically together at... ...Erzurum high school. How are you, Mahmut? I'm good, thank you. You've gotten a little fatter since I last saw you. - And you've gotten younger, praise God. - Well, apparently the vacation helped. - Did you see the Rascals? - I did. - Huh? What's he saying? - He has, he has! - What tricksters those Rascals are! They made a fool of me too. - Yeah! Well, what did they say? The name speaks for itself - the Rascals Class. Teacher Mahmut was so surprised when he saw us. Did you see his face when he heard that we're still in the same class? Man, he didn't even get upset at all by the fake diploma bit. He's really a great guy! What are you saying, man! Teacher Mahmut is one of us now. This year we'll easily play our tricks and get away with them too. We'll smoke our cigarettes too, right? Teacher Mahmut! Friends, a healthy generation can only be reached with physical education. Do you understand? Don't forget this - a smart mind is found in a fit body. From now on, summer and winter alike, whether it rains or snows... ...we will be having all of our classes outside. Do you understand? - This guy is going to give us a headache. - Where did he come from anyway? My ideal teacher! Let's see your physical conditions now. He wants to see our what? - Condition. - What's that? It's not found in cows so you don't have to worry. What are you laughing at? Athletes don't laugh! All together! Turn right! What are you doing? I said right, right! Right! Get in line! Start! One two, one two, one two.. Stop! Get in line! You're not running, you're crawling! Because you don't have bodies of steel. - You fatty! Come here - Me, teacher? - Yes you! You've gotten tired, my son. Of course you'll get tired. - What's this? - My stomach, sir. That's not a stomach, it's a gut. But I will get rid of it all. You're going to be like a needle. - You! Come! - Is he talking to me? - You, you! Behold, someone actually athletic but who has let himself go... Where is he? Suck in your stomach! Shoulders straight! Chin up! Stick out your chest! Eyes ahead! Look, praise God, he's like a lion. A cow like a lion. Get in your spot! Now you will repeat everything I do. Whatever I do, you will do the same. Do you understand? If it keeps going like this, we're going to die for physical education! We need to find a way out of this. I'll say it one last time. You will do exactly as I do. Start. One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! What are you doing? - What are you doing? Don't do everything I do! - Don't do everything I do! Look at who's coming! - Look at who's coming! I'm sorry but I can't be the assistant principal this year.. Let's forget the past, Mahmut. That unpleasant issue is over. And who else can be assistant principal at this school but you? Okay but under one condition. I can't make decisions about the students' lives on my own. I want a disciplinary committee. That's easy my friend, easy. I'll think about it. Principal, a young girl just came. She wants to see you. - Let her in. - Come. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Here you are. - Let me introduce you to our assistant principal, Mahmut - Pleased to meet you. Our new literature teacher, Ms. Semra. The new literature teacher? Yes. This young girl is a teacher? Hafize! Welcome to our school. She's pretty young. - Is this your first time as a teacher? - Yes, sir. Well, what can we do? Let's hope for the best. Come on Domdom, come on Domdom. Teacher Mahmut! What are you all doing this time? We're arm wrestling, teacher. I see that. I won! You're grown men! Aren't you embarrassed? Sit in your seats! The principal ordered it, teacher. The principal told you to arm wrestle? No, he said to pick a representative. - This is how we pick a representative. - I understand. This year, some of your teachers have changed. One of whom is your new literature teacher. I want to discuss this with you. Your teacher... Come in. - Students, this is your new literature teacher. - Good morning. Stop it! Shut up! Students, your new literature teacher, Ms. Semra. She finished university this year. This is her first time working at our school. I am certain that the pranks you make on other teachers... ...you won't be inflicting on my young colleague here. But I still wanted to give you one warning. Okay? Do you understand? - Good luck. - Thank you Yes. Yes, teacher? Teacher, you seem very nervous. A bit. How wouldn't she be? It's her first class. Teacher, praise God, you are very young. Thank you. How old are you? Hey, you cow! You're not supposed to ask a woman her age. You're right, it shouldn't be asked. Excuse me. Teacher, are you married? No, I'm single. Me too. Teacher, have you ever been to Konya? - No I haven't Well isn't your middle name Süheyla? - No I'll be damned! No way! Why are you surprised? It's just that you look so similar... - To whom? My first love. Let's be serious! We should get serious, she says. Yes. Yes. Yes. We get it, yes! Teacher, these first classes are routine. The students get to know the teacher. Nice to meet you. Güdük. Güdük Necmi, teacher. How do you do? I'm fine, thank you. - And I'm Ferit. - Groom Ferit. One second... And I am Şaban. What's going on? Oh it's nothing. It's just that these jackasses want to call me something else... What do they want to call you? - Cow Oh please. Thank you. I got used to it, and you will too. Man, look at this food they give us on the first day at school. Lentil soup with worms and raw pasta. It seems this stingy principal is going to make us long for last year. Hafize, what are the teachers doing here? Don't be so nosy all the time! The principal ordered it. This year, all of the meals will be eaten all together like this. With your permission. Look behind you, Şaban. What's the physical education teacher doing? What do you think? He's flirting with Ms. Semra. That prick! I already knew I didn't like his personality. Ms. Semra, would you like a cigarette? Thank you but I don't smoke. Good for you Ms. Semra. Me neither. Listen, Ms. Semra, these lazy students will cheat a lot. You're new. If you want, I can help you. Because I'm the only one they can't trick. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Look at how he breathes the smoke in. Man, this is torture! We need to find a solution to this smoking problem. - Hey, are you new here? - Yes. - Do you have any matches? - Yeah. - Give me some. Since you have matches, you probably also have cigarettes. Yeah, here you go. Give me those cigarettes! Man, aren't you ashamed smoking at school like that? Didn't Teacher Mahmut ban it, idiot? Smartass! Shamelessly smoking at school. - Come on. - Come on. Teacher, ma'am. Yes? Could you go out for a little while? Why? Well, we're the cleaning crew for the school, ma'am. We decided to finish cleaning while the teachers were in the garden. Yes. Okay. She bought that so easily. Come on, take out the cigarettes. Come on. - Here we go. - That guy got so red, didn't he? I slapped that jackass good, didn't I? Oh man, thank heaven! Here. Hey Güdük. If I thought about it for 40 years, I would never have thought that... ...the safest place to smoke would be the teacher's lounge. What should we do, man? There's no escaping Teacher Mahmut anywhere else. Now let him look for us in all the bathrooms. Why are you sitting here up against the door? Because the cleaning crew is inside. What cleaning crew? I don't know. Six literature students said they were going to do some cleaning. I understand. Guys, can you imagine if Teacher Mahmut opened the door and came in now. Teacher Mahmut! Yeah. That's what I'm saying too - Teacher Mahmut. Teacher Mahmut. We were all just talking about you. Wonderful, I see that you finished cleaning very quickly. Yes, we did a rough job. Guys, you're already out of control on the first day. I won't punish you. But I'm warning you one last time that I won't let you smoke at school. Here you go guys. Drink up your coffee with pleasure, come on. Man, where are my sandals? I'll be damned. I think my mom forgot to pack them for me again. ♫ I've been searching for my lost love for years. Please God give me an Otomidon, without cigarettes my head's killing me. - Do you have extra hangers? - Let me give you some. - Thanks. ♫ Don't you dare give me hope if you're going to love someone else. ♫ Don't you dare give me hope if you're going to love someone else. What's that, Şaban? - Fresh eggs. I brought them from home. - Are you going to sleep on a nest? No man... I'm going to drink them in the morning. For strength. It's rotten. From a deep freezer. It's fresh daily, man, fresh! From my aunt's chickens. Wait a second. This doesn't look like your aunt's egg. It's not your uncle's egg is it? Stop joking around! - Güdük. - Hm? - Only you can understand my situation. - What happened this time? - You know Ms. Semra? - Yeah? I'm crazy for her. Something jumped inside me right here. What's going to happen to me? Oh Şaban, don't worry. Anything can happen in a day. Yeah. Anything. Gentleman Şaban, this must be what they call love at first sight. As soon as you entered the classroom, your wild charm hypnotized me. You were in my dreams all night. - Hurry up, Necmi, the envelope and stamp are ready. - I'm almost done, calm down. I'm embarrassed by the amount of money I'm making. My old age, the fact that my eyesight is going... I'm not able to be of much use to my students. I see you're an early riser this morning. Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Teacher Mahmut. I was just discussing my grievances with the young lady... It's just that my retirement salary isn't sufficient. My son is a senior in college. Until he can support himself I have to work. I definitely understand. My father got us through school with the same hardships. Good morning! - Good morning - Good morning - Does your father still work? - He passed away. Ah... How is everyone? All is well, thank you. Oh, our friend came and he's already taking a nap. Good morning. Your morning coffees are here. Here you are. - How are you, Hafize? - I'm fine, thank you. Here you are. - Here you are. - Thank you. You may as well have one too. - We win 3-0. - Ah fuck man! Dilaver, look man, this part sticks up, look. - It'll stay down. - I want to look very handsome. Why, Şaban? - Promise you won't tell anyone. - I promise I won't. - Swear on your mother's grave. - I swear on my mother's grave. - I'm trying to look good for Ms. Semra. - You devil! - Hush. - Şaban, you have a letter. Here. - Goodness gracious, give it to me. Go away so I can read it. GOAL! "My sweetheart, yesterday as you came into class..." - He bought it, the cow! - Be quiet, calm down. "If you are going to reciprocate my love, say 'Moo' like a cow three times." "I made this plan so no one else could figure it out." She made a smart choice. "My ferocious man!" GOAL! What is that, Şaban? Is it a love letter? - Oh no, it's just a letter about work. - Why don't you read it to us? It doesn't concern you. It's a personal matter. - Good morning. - Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. Sit in your seats. Bahaban the Cow: Sit down she says! I strongly disapprove of what you did in the teacher's lounge yesterday. I am a new teacher and I might not know all the rules of the school... ...but you should not have taken advantage of this fact. You are right, we behaved shamefully. We are sorry and I deplore you all. - Moo! - What are you doing, Şaban? - You know, Moo! - Moo? Yes, Moo! Let's be serious please! The topic is Divan literature. And one of the most important varieties is the ode. The ode is a popular love and wine poem. Does anyone want to give an example of an ode? - I do, teacher. - Yes, go ahead. ♫ A man passed here on horseback! He stepped on my wounds and went on. Oh! ♫ Wandering for months, wandering. Wandering for days, wandering. ♫ Let me give my sweet heart to whoever brings me love. ♫ Wandering for months, wandering. Wandering for days, wandering. Thank you all for that example ode. But what you sang was not an ode, it was a folk song. There's no place for folk songs in this class. My sweetheart, I longingly await your response... What are you writing man? A love letter? No, I'm writing to my dad. Stop joking around. What girl's heart did you steal this time? - Listen, I'm only telling my secret to you. - Okay. - Don't tell anyone. - I promise, I won't tell. - Swear on your mother's grave. - I swear on my mom's grave, I won't. Ms. Semra and I are in love. This letter is for her. Let me put it in the mailbox. - Şaban, what is that? - A letter. - To whom? - My dad. Come on cow stop joking. Aren't you even going to tell your best friend? I'm only telling my secret to you. Swear on your mom's grave you won't tell. - I swear, I won't tell. - Ms. Semra and I are in love, this is for her. "Our love will never fade." "You are not a teacher to me, but the rosebud of my flower garden." Hey kids! Didn't I tell you not to play ball out on the front lawn? Teacher, that was last year. All the rules of last year are valid for this year too. Come on go get dressed. Get going! - Teacher Mahmut has started squeezing us. - He's really spoiling all of our fun. - Don't smoke! Don't play ball! How great! - Hey guys, does anyone want to smoke? Are you stupid? Didn't Teacher Mahmut take away all our cigarettes? Look, they call these cigarettes. And they're the best kind. As long as there's no place to smoke, what good will those do? Man, the bathrooms and attic are off limits but the basement isn't! - Of course! - Come on, follow me! This is good and all but are we going to smoke in the basement the whole year? What can we do, man? There's no escape from Teacher Mahmut. We can't play ball. We can't smoke cigarettes. How great. Well, what did you expect? That Mahmut teacher of 40 years would change for us? If he's Teacher Mahmut of 40 years, then we're the Rascals Class of 40 years. Okay but what are we going to do? - We're going to bare our teeth. - How so? - How so? We're going to sneak out to the Fener match tomorrow. - Will Mr. Veysel leave the door? - What if there is a teacher with us? - But which teacher can we trick? - What day does Ms. Semra teach? - Good morning! - Good morning, ma'am. - Sit down. - Sit down, she says. What's this wreath doing here? - Aren't we going, teacher? - Where? - To the cemetery! Why would we go to the cemetery? You should be ashamed! How could a literature teacher like yourself... ...not know the date of Tevfik Fikret's death? Is today the death anniversary of Tevfik Fikret? Of course! Our knowledge of literature is a bit scarce but we know one thing well. The death anniversaries of poets. He's not better than you, but our last teacher was interested in these things. We spent our lives in cemeteries. I feel like it was on another day. Oh well. Let me go tell Mr. Mahmut. Teacher! Teacher Mahmut already knows. In fact, he had the wreath made himself. Oh okay then. Come on, let's go. Open the door please, Mr. Veysel. What's going on Ms. teacher? Where are you going like this? - To visit the grave of Tevfik Fikret. - Was he closely related? My condolences. Mr. Mahmut, did you send the Rascals Class to some ceremony? To what ceremony? Well, just a while ago, Ms. Semra left out the front door with them. Yeah? Yeah! And they greeted me very kindly, I liked it. But wouldn't it be better to send me instead of a young lady to this ceremony? You know, during the War of Independence... - Mr. Mahmut? - Yes, Mr. Akil The Rascals Class isn't anywhere to be found again. Did I maybe mix up the classes? You didn't mix them up, Akil. You didn't mix them up. Champions! Champions! - Come on in, you punks. Welcome. - Mr. Veysel, did you see Ms. Semra? How could I not? She left with you guys and then came back crying. Teacher Mahmut? Did Mahmut teacher ask about us? - No! - Come on, let's go. Why did I believe them instead of coming and asking you? That's enough, you've already beaten yourself up about it. What should I do? I can't forgive myself. They embarrassed me to get back at you. Don't dwell on them. As if that wasn't enough, they looked me in the eye and invited me to the match. Don't be upset. In fact, what they did was directed at me. Putting it all aside, how could I forget the date of Tevfik Fikret's death? Look here! Teacher Mahmut is on the stairs again. Welcome back, gentlemen. Thank you teacher. So, how was the match? - It was great teacher! - We won 2-0. - King Fener! I heard you also invited Ms. Semra. Güdük, you see, he's jealous. - If you want, we can invite you next week. - Yeah. If you like, let's deal with the punishment for your nasty actions first. Let's, teacher! - I bet you'll make us go hungry tonight. - I bet so too. No. Then we won't get a break this weekend. That's a pretty minor punishment compared to what you did, isn't it? Well, teacher, in God's name, are you going to take our souls in the first week? No. I'm going to give you a punishment fit for children. Tomorrow, you'll stand on one leg like little kids in front of the whole school. Please teacher! - Please don't humiliate us! - Think about our pride, teacher! Did you all think about the pride of your young teacher? - Good morning, Teacher Mahmut. - What are they doing like that? - They're being punished. - Is this a type of punishment? - A class like this gets punished like this. - Look at them, the fools. We embraced Teacher Mahmut and he made us miserable. - Will you run all the way to the hospital? - We should have left him to die. Everyone's looking at us. - Look somewhere else, little twerp. - Stop grinning! Go on, get out of here. Look at her over there! She became a literature teacher... ...and she doesn't know the date of Tevfik Fikret's death. - On top of that, she's posturing at us. - And we're the ones punished. What's this Mr. Mahmut? - They're being punished. - Ha! What a great punishment! Good morning. I said good morning. - How are you, teacher? - I'm good. - Your eyes are shining, teacher. - I don't understand. How can you not understand? You got the rascals punished, didn't you? - A punishment you all deserved. - Are you at least happy now? Let's stop talking about this. What did you think of Mahmut teacher's punishment? Did you like it? I didn't think about it. I might have given you a different punishment. Please God tell us, teacher. Would you have hung us or cut us? Students! At any rate, we would have died at your hands. Is that bad? Don't forget you're talking to a teacher! You're always so interested in the idea of being a teacher. Please, that's enough! You forgot your days of being a student so quickly, teacher. That's enough I said! Enough! You've all become grown men... ...but forget being students, you haven't even learned how to be human beings. I certainly haven't forgotten my days as a student. But I'm not a spoiled rich kid like all of you. I studied despite many hardships on the small salary of a dignified teacher. I didn't even have a second dress to wear. Whereas you call yourselves "students" and waste all your time lazily... ...I studied non-stop. It's so sad that I'm now a teacher for you inconsiderate, irresponsible students. How pathetic are you all... ...that you mock the things I take pride in? I feel sorry for you all. What's going on, my dear? What's happening? I can't take it anymore, sir. I'm resigning. Yeah? Are you sure? Yes. I can't do it. Come here. Sit down. Sit, sit. Tell me about it. What happened? At first, I came here with very good feelings. But those students wiped out all of my good thoughts. They did outrageous things and I didn't say a word. They ridiculed me and I pretended not to hear. They played with my pride and I stayed quiet. But their last rude behavior exhausted my patience. You're right. You endured pretty well. You know what? I also resigned after my second day as a teacher. Then I thought about it all night. Did I do the right thing? Is a teacher's job just to teach classes... ...and then to be defeated and run away at the very first obstacle? No, it wasn't this. What was important was to struggle, against every difficulty and obstacle. Yes, this is how I thought... ...and the next morning I tore up my resignation letter and threw it away. I didn't run away. I persisted. Now, years later, I'm very happy with the decision I made. So, what will you do? Will you run away? Or will you stay? I'm staying! Every meal is lentil soup and pasta. We're going to get poisoned this way! - Teacher Mahmut! - What is it this time? Won't you tell the principal to give us some different meals? Okay, I'll tell him. Seriously, sir, our bowels are destroyed. I understand. Why did the principal get so stingy this year, teacher? I don't know. Why don't you ask him yourself? I have a more important topic than your meals. I think you all were the cause of a very bad incident today. Ms. Semra wanted to resign. But we didn't do anything, sir. If you didn't, then why would a teacher who loves teaching so much... ...and furthermore, who has to work so hard, want to resign? How should we know? Maybe she didn't like the school. No. It's you, or rather your behavior, that she didn't like. Listen to me! From now on you all better watch your steps! Students, I won't let you disrespect Ms. Semra. I don't want to sound too critical but our friends are acting a little lazy. Thank you. If they put in a little effort no one would be able to cheat. Look, for 30 years I haven't had a single student cheat in my class. How could I not know, sir. Didn't I watch you last year? Excuse me sir. I'm sorry to bother you. Do you remember? You promised me something. What promise, Ms. Semra? If I gave a written exam, you said you would help me. - Ah, of course. - I want to give an exam this class. Sure. My class is empty anyway... ...and this way you can learn how to prevent students from cheating. Thank you very much. My ferocious man. I can't bear it any longer, Şaban. - I can't look into your eyes. - Students! Students listen up! - What's with the rush, Hafize? - Is there something wrong? Yes, yes! That young girl is going to give a literature written exam. And she's giving it with the one who can't be duped. You heard it from me. Be careful man! Don't cut yourself. - Is that okay, Güdük? Are you comfortable? - I'm very comfortable. What's Güdük doing in the stove? He's going to write all the answers inside the stove. - How will he write on all our exams? - Man, he's going to use carbon paper. Okay, but it's so dark in the stove. - What do you think this is? - Ha, oh that? A flashlight. Yes. Now I get it. Look, they're coming. Shut up, shut up! - "Quick!" Come on! - "Go to your place!" - Good morning. - Good morning. Students, take out a piece of paper. We are going to have a written exam. Nothing else should be on your desks. Go ahead. Write. 1. The types of Divan poems. 2. What is an ode? 3. Explain the main theme of Leyla and Mecnun. If anyone tries to cheat, I will ruin them. You can't dupe me! Careful. No one move! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. Start! Ms. Semra Haným, don't you dare look away from me. Don't move! You! Eyes ahead. You! Don't look up from your paper. We need to be careful with these guys. - He keeps stepping on my paper. - Shut up, don't speak. Don't look right. Don't look left. Do you understand? Turn around! See, look how well-behaved they are. That's all it takes. - Give me that paper. - Here you are. Teacher, the Rascals Class doesn't cheat. - Is something wrong? - Oh no, no. Yeah? Okay. - Why aren't you writing? - I'm thinking, sir. Of course. If you don't study, you'll be stuck thinking like a sucker. Psst, Tulum! Impossible Ms. Semra. Impossible. As long as I walk around like this, it's impossible for them to cheat. How did you write so quickly? Your paper was blank a second ago. It all came to me at once, sir. Yeah... Is that so? Good for you then. Welcome sir. Come in Mr. Mahmut. I hope it's going well. We're just giving a written exam... No talking! Don't look behind you! Do you understand? Turn around! I said turn! I won't be duped, I won't! You can't dupe me. - Ferit, where is Necmi? - Uh... well... I think he's sick. - Didn't he get permission from you? - No. He didn't. Isn't it a little cold in here? Aren't you guys cold? - No. - No, teacher. Don't you think we should light this stove? It's really hot, sir. Let's not light it, oof. Let's light it. Get out. What is this student doing inside the stove, Mr. Mahmut? He's probably cheating. In all my 30 years of teaching, you are the first... ...student to be able to cheat. I congratulate you, bravo. Why do you stand like that every morning? You will also grow up! Students, the superintendent is at our school today! He is going to come to Mahmut teacher's history class now. I know him very well and he always asks the same questios. Even the order he asks them in never changes. The questions are very easy. - For example, you! - Me? - Yes you! - Who burnt down Rome? - I swear it wasn't me. - I asked who burnt down Rome. - I said I swear it wasn't me, principal sir! - What is he saying? - Şaban doesn't lie, principal sir... ...if he says he didn't do it then he didn't. Yes. You smartass punks! Memorize what I tell you. Who was the first Caliph? The holy Ebubekir. Come on, repeat it! The holy Ebubekir. Good! In what year was Istanbul conquered? 1453. 1453! Our homeland is what to us? It is our mother. It's our mother! Who was the last sultan of the Ottoman expansion? Sultan Süleyman the lawgiver. Kanuni Sultan Süleyman! Who burnt down Rome? Emperor Nero. Emperor Nero! Repeat. The holy Ebubekir, 1453, our mother... ...Sultan Süleyman the lawgiver, Emperor Nero. Repeat. The holy Ebubekir, 1453, our mother... ...Sultan Süleyman the lawgiver, Emperor Nero. Good. Welcome! Students, our esteemed superintendent, Hüseyin Sevki Topuz. Good morning students! - Good morning. - Sit down. - With your permission. - Good bye. - What is the topic, Mr. Mahmut? - The Ottoman period of expansion. Good, with your permission I'll ask the students a few questions. - Feel free to ask. - You! Me! - What's your name? - The holy Ebubekir. - I said what's your name. - I said the holy Ebubekir. What's your name... your name!? Ohhh, my name. The holy Şaban. - How old are you? - 1453. - Wait, how old are you? - 1453. - Who burnt down Rome? - My mom. Son, who is your mom? Sultan Süleyman the lawgiver! Who is the first Caliph? - Emperor Nero. - Yes. My son, you're mixing them up. The holy Şaban burnt down Rome. The first Caliph Emperor Nero, I mean Sultan Nero, in Rome... ...with the holy Şaban, to your mom... ...in one day 1453 times by law.. Excuse me Mr. Mahmut. I think I mixed things up a bit. Yes sir, go ahead. Gentlemen, this is called a shot put. First you will squeeze it under the chin ... and place it well. The left hand is forward ... Your weight on your feet behind ... You will press it with your whole body. Like this one! Go get it! Don't forget that! The shot isn't "fired" ... He pushes with his whole body. Let's start! Arm forward! Bend your knee! Put it on. Good! Okay, throw! You! Come here! Okay ... Throw yourself! You! You waitresses! Throw it! Can't get up! Pick it up! Can not be! "Pick him up!" I say it can't be lifted, he says, pick it up! Shut up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up! Raise it higher! Throw it! Yeah! One is in the beginning school, the other is in One is in elementary school, another in middle, and the last in high school. Why didn't you say that at your young age you are acting... ...as both the mother and father for your three siblings? - Yes, you could say that. - How are they doing in school? Good, very good. They never worry me. They call this a hammer. You throw it like this. Be careful, it's not easy. Hold the handle tight and with all your might swing it 3 times and throw it. One, two, three. Yeah! - He's showing off to Ms. Semra again. - That prick, I'll show him now. - Is it your turn? - Yeah. Let's see you throw it. One, two, three, four... ...I can't stop! Stop! Stop it man! You idiot! I can't stop! Come on stop! Stop hammer! I can't stop! Of course he can't stop. Because his muscles aren't strong. Especially his stomach muscles. They should be like steel when squeezed. Look, like this. Punch me right here. - Please teacher. - Punch me come on. But you can't hit a teacher. Come on, don't be scared. Nothing will happen, it's like steel. Punch me! - Come on punch me! - Okay I guess I'll punch you. Help your teacher up. Lentils and pasta, right Hafize mom My God! Donut in syrup! Go away! Meatballs ... With olive oil! Put your hands down! Please allow me to take one! Don't touch, they are not for you. They are for teachers! Chiefs have specially prepared for the superintendant. So we can't eat them? What should I do I will die if I do not eat them. You will not do it. We will eat them. I have an idea, come with me! Excuse me! We need to tell you something important, but we're scared. - What is it? - Our friends have played a really terrible prank. - What did they do? - The principal had a special meal made for the superintendent. - So? - Our friends put some laxatives in it. They put laxatives in it? - Yep - Who did this? - We can't tell you that. They can't hear that we told you or they'll kill us. Okay, thank you. - Ms. Hafize, Ms. Hafize! - Yes? Did anyone from the Rascals Class come in here? - They were here a little while ago. - Who? Güdük Necmi, Domdom Ali, Tulum Hayri, Hayta Ismail. Did they get close to the food? They tried to mess with it but I smacked their hands. I understand, may God punish them. They're going to eat this food. Oh oh, good good. You'll see whether it's good or bad. Come on, eat up let's see. I said eat this food or you'll be in deep trouble. We can't eat it, principal sir. Why? Is there something in it? That's not why, principal sir. Then why? We won't be able to eat while our friends sit and watch. Of course, let them eat it too. - Pass it out Ms. Hafize. - Whatever you say. I'm going to kill this guy. Don't get mad, Şaban. Eat this delicious food first. Yes. I'll kill him after the meal. - He's here. - The teacher's here. Sit, students. Sit. Sorry I'm late. This Istanbul traffic problem! Anyway, where did we end last time? - Thinking, teacher. - Ah yes. Thinking. In all of the world, thinking is something unique to humans only. Aristotle said, "The human is a thinking creature." - Şaban is a thinking cow. - Man, your mom... Yes. Animals have their instincts, but humans find their way with reason. What's going on? - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Who are you? I'm Hüseyin Sevki Topuz, superintendent from the Department of Education. It's always the same joke. I'm tired of it. Sit in your seat! I don't understand. He's really the superintendent, teacher. What superintendent? Every year it's the same joke. Sit down I said. What are you saying? Don't test my patience or you'll get smacked! Listen to me, come to your senses. I'm superintendent Hüseyin Sevki Topuz. Yeah sure you're the superintendent. You insolent punk! Sit down! You're the insolent one! You'll see the day! Swearing at the superintendent? How can that even happen? I swear, I thought the students were playing another prank. - You know my eyes... - Mr. Akil, Mr. Akil... If he reports this to the department, they'll shut down the school. - Well then what will we do, sir? - I really don't know. But under these... ...conditions, I can't let you stay here. - At least let me stay until year's end. Mr. Akil, you can't even stay until tomorrow. I'm sorry. I understand. I understand. - Goodbye, my dear. - Bye bye, sir. Well, what can we do? This is fate. Anyhow, teaching at my old age... - ...wasn't the right thing to do. - What are you saying, Mr. Akil. - That's how it is, goodbye. - Bye bye. I wouldn't have wanted to leave you all this way but what can I do? Goodbye. - Bye bye, sir. - Goodbye. Don't worry Mr. Akil, forget it. - Well then, goodbye. - Bye bye. - Goodbye! - Bye bye, my friend. - Goodbye, Mr. Mahmut. - Bye bye, sir. - Give me your blessing, Hafize. - You should give your blessing, sir. Goodbye! Together: goodbye teacher! You are all very nice children. I'll miss you. We will miss you too! Don't forget your teacher Akil! What's up, I don't hear anyone talking. - We're feeling down, teacher. Why, what happened? - We're sad about Akil, teacher. Why are you sad when it was your fault? What did we do, teacher? If you hadn't done your prank every year, do you think he'd have acted like that? You're right, teacher. Teacher Mahmut. Can't we fix this problem? What could you do? - Let's go to the governor. - Let's head to the prime minister. Let's beg the president. In fact, you don't need to do any of these things. The current head of the Department of Education is an old student of Mr. Akil. If he wanted, he could fix this with one phone call. But Mr. Akil is so proud that he would never think to do that. What if there was someone who did think to do that though? Well, then the situation would change of course. Mr. Mahmut! We're ruined Mr. Mahmut! We're ruined! We're ruined! - What's wrong, principal sir? - I didn't like the look on his face when he left. - Whose? - Who else's? The superintendent's. He must have complained. The minister is coming. The minister of education. - Yeah? - There's no way out this time. He'll close the school. But you're a witness. Didn't I fire Mr. Akil at once? - Yeah you did. - We need to do something. - It's over. Everything's over. - Slow down, don't get agitated. God is great. Welcome esteemed minister. You make us proud. Welcome. - Thank you. - I'm the school's principal, Muharrem Gür. - Vice principal, Mr. Mahmut. - Is that so? - Welcome, sir. - Would you like another tea, sir? - No thank you. - A piece of cake? - This is enough. Enjoy your meal, sir. How did you like our school? Good, good. Very good. Thank you, sir. Don't hold back. I figured I'd visit a few schools while I was already in Istanbul. But I had... ...a special reason for visiting this school. - What is that, sir? - I came for Mr. Akil. - You came for Mr. Akil? - Yes, I heard he was teaching here. You know what? I was also a teacher. The person who made me love this blessed... - ...occupation was my philosophy teacher Mr. Akil. - Mr. Akil? He is a very talented and valuable teacher worthy of respect. But I don't see him. Is he not here today or did he leave the school? Mr. Akil? Would Mr. Akil ever leave this school, sir? He's our most valued teacher. He felt a bit sick so he's resting for a few days. I'm sorry. I would have liked to talk to him. Well tell him to get better soon. Give him my respect and sympathy. I always hold him in high esteem. Stop for a second. - How are you, students? - Good, thank you, sir. - I guess you got what you wanted. - Thank you very much, sir. - You're very great. Thank you. - Actually, I want to thank you. It's not much, but you gave me the chance to help my teacher Akil. Bye. Let's go. We learned the elegy and the ode. Now let's look at the poetic meter a bit. - Akil teacher! - My dear Ms. Semra! Welcome. Seeing you here again is so wonderful. Thank you. Excuse me, I'm interrupting but I'l just take a minute of your time. Please, go ahead. Students, Teacher Mahmut told me... ...that my being back at school is thanks to you. Believe me when I say that... ...I've never been more happy in my whole life. You all have hearts of gold. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes, where were we? Jump. Jump. Come on. May God help you all... Stop! You're doing it wrong! This move is done like this. - Did you get it? In your places! - Teacher. - What is it? - I want to ask you something. How do martial artists break those tiles? It's very easy, very simple. - Can you break them? - I don't know, I've never tried. But... ...I can break them. I will break them! - Should we try it, teacher? Right now? Bring me some tiles. If I remember correctly, you need to focus all your strength to one point. It's a matter of concentration. - What's that? - A tile, sir. - How many? - Seven, sir. - Isn't seven too many? - So you cannot break them? Let me try. Spread out a little. They didn't break, sir. My hand broke. You guys, stop playing. Man, Güdük, if anything bad comes from this... - I ruined you so badly ... - Oh, man, you don't believe me? I trust you, Ferit. What's this? - What did you step into today? - Güdük! Or did I step in some shit? Man, isn't it your birthday today? Yes. Ah my dear friends. - Here - Happy birthday, Şaban. - May all your days be as good as today. - Here you go. Ah my dear friends. What a delight. Hafize, come. Don't let him notice. - Okay. - Come on. - Dear Şaban, this is my gift. - Thank you, Hafize. - And this came in the mail. - Oh gosh, I wonder who it's from. - Is it from your lover? - Could be. Hold on let me open this. Oh wow. They sent a necklace! Look, it's a necklace! - Man, Şaban, what a great gift! - Happy birthday! - Your lover must have sent it. - Yes. Look, a necklace. - Okay, Şaban blow out the candles. - Let's eat some cake. - Yes. Should I put out the candles? - Of course, come on. What's happening? What's this sound? - Here you are, teacher. - What's this, Şaban? Cake. My birthday cake. Thanks to my friends who bought it. - I turned 27. - I understand. Congratulations, happy birthday. - What's that around your neck? - It's a birthday present from... - ...a close friend. - Oh... It seems like an interesting gift to me... ...Don't you guys think so? Like a bell for... - Like a bell for what, teacher? - Is it like a cow bell? Shhh. Be quiet. Thank you. Go ahead and sit down now. - Şaban! - What? I think Teacher Mahmut is right. This girl is making fun of you. - No way! - Believe me. Where do you usually find this kind of bell? - Yeah, on cows. - I get it. Şaban, you've suffered a serious insult. - I have? - Yes. - Yes. That treacherous woman! She'll see! This love will end now! Do you hear me? All right Mehmet Akif 'Sefahati' ... Muslim nations should to be wrapped around each other ... Is there something wrong, Mr. Chaban? Fuck you! You played with my honor! I do not understand. - You are going to do! Take your cards, give me my cards. The cards of our fading love! And this is your disgraceful present! It's all over between us! You say I wrote all these letters, don't you? No, my father wrote! Who is to blame for this ugly joke I'm asking you! Who wrote all this Didn't you write? Shut up! Even if no one says that who wrote these ... it will be bad for all of you! I ask last time; Who wrote all these I wrote them! No, I wrote them! I wrote! Look at me... Didn't you write all this? Slap in the face Oh! - It was always one for all and all for one. - It's still like that, man. You guys could play any joke on me but no one else could touch a hair on my head. - Of course they can't. - What now? I just got insulted. - Then who will hold someone responsible? - We will. - How so? - That insult wasn't just to Şaban. It was to the Rascals Class. - We should get revenge. - We should get back so good that... they'll understand what the Rascals Class really is. Can you tie this tie? How does my hair look? Good? Ms. Semra will see what inappropriateness really means. Man, no one insults the Rascals. Forget it, let her worry about the consequences. Come on then. May our holy war be blessed. Good morning. Good morning. What's going on? Why are you all sitting in the front rows? We wanted to be closer to you. Why? We can't hear your sweet voice as well from the back. Stop the naughtiness. - What? Do you like how we look today? - Are we handsome? Go back to your seats. - Don't deprive us of your beauty. - Your breath excites us from here. I said sit in your seats. Take out paper and a pencil. We're having an exam. Listen. We're all going to write love letters to her, got it? Okay, got it. Write. Question 1. Who were the poets of the journal Servet-i Fünun? Question 2. The trends in our national literature. Question 3. List the works of Mehmet Akif. My dark-eyed... My dear sweetheart... My beautiful angel... The woman of my life... My love... - These are love letters, sir! - I understand, dear. This is rude. This is more than just rude. It's disgusting! You're right, my dear. But don't get so upset. Since I came here, they haven't stopped. I was almost fed up but I kept quiet. They wrote love letters to their friend from me, just like these. I still didn't speak up. But this time... ...all together they wrote love letters to me, to a teacher! Is this acceptable? Is it okay to write love letters to a teacher? You're right, my dear. Can this type of vulgarity be allowed? We'll punish them. We'll warn them, we'll reprimand them... What are you saying, sir? They must all be expelled! Are you crazy? And then what will I do? Work is already slow... This isn't a business, sir. It's a school! It's a school but do you know how much money goes into keeping this school? I know all of it. And you should know this. Either all these uncivilized students will be expelled. Or I'll complain to the department and have your school shut down. Wait a second, wait my dear. Mahmut, for the love of God, say something. Make a decision. I told you on the very first day that I would not be making any decisions... ...regarding the students on my own. So what should I do now? Assemble the disciplinary council, sir. Did you write these? Well then why? Why did you do it? Didn't I tell you all to not mock your teachers? To not humiliate them?... ...And that in the end, it would end up hurting all of you? Isn't it a pity for you? Isn't it sad to the year that you lost? I guess we weren't able to teach you anything good then. I guess there's nothing left to discuss then, right? - Yes. - You can leave. Okay then friends. The offense they committed is clear. For an administrator, the punishment would be to kick them out of school. Well, what can we do? It is for their own good. But even so, let's talk to Ms. Semra one last time. - What do you think? - Good idea. - Yeah. - Ms. Hafize. Can you call Ms. Semra? - Certainly, sir. - They're calling you inside, dear. - Alright, Hafize. My dear, everything rests on you. Come on, don't be so stubborn. Be the bigger person. Forgive my children. Hafize, if I was your daughter would you have forgiven them? Here I am, sir. You called for me. Ms. Semra, before the disciplinary council makes its decision, we decided... ...to speak with you one more time. The punishment for the students' misbehavior is already clear. But we still want to ask. Do you insist... ...on expelling them? If you were in my place, what would you do, Mr. Mahmut? I would do what you are doing, my dear. You're right. Sit down. Students, I came to tell you the decision of the disciplinary council. You are all expelled. Teacher, how will we tell our families that we're expelled? You should have thought about that when you were misbehaving. You don't understand. Our families won't believe us. They'll think we ran away. Fine. I'll inform your parents. Teacher, when should we leave the school. In three days. School will be on break then anyway. You'll get your final grades and leave. Esteemed faculty. Dear friends. For tonight, we prepared a bit of entertainment for ourselves. Hopefully you will enjoy it too. We, the 6 Literature A class. That is, the name you have given us... ...the Rascals Class, is bidding our school farewell tomorrow. It's painful to leave the school, but we came as Rascals... ...and we want to leave as Rascals. To our fellow students, and to our beloved teachers... ...if we have done anything to offend you up until now, forgive us. In front of you, tonight's first surprise. Cow Şaban and Hafize Mom! ♫ Are you the lily of the valley that is decorating my love garden? ♫ Are you the lily of the valley that is decorating my love garden? ♫ Are you the firefly that lights up my night? ♫ Are you the firefly that lights up my night? ♫ Youth clouds my head, my first love, first excitement. ♫ Youth clouds my head, my first love, first excitement. ♫ Are you the firefly that runs when chased? ♫ Are you the firefly that runs when chased? Now coming before you: The Rascals Singers! ♫ I attended many schools. I didn't like any of them. ♫ In the whole wide world, I never saw a class like this one. ♫ I don't want a teacher like this, even if I did I wouldn't. ♫ We said 'Let's play a prank,' and then we ruined everything. ♫ Oh Rascals, alas Rascals, the Rascals are done for alas. ♫ My troubles won't continue, oh God I've had enough. ♫ When one ends, the other begins, please God no more. ♫ It started like this and honestly I'm scared it'll end like this. ♫ Isn't there a cure my friends, Almighty God? ♫ The world is in good spirits again, thank God. ♫ Hopefully fate will also smile on us one day. ♫ It started like this and honestly I'm scared it'll end like this. ♫ Isn't there a cure my friends, Almighty God? - Oh, my dad. - Who? My dad, man, my dad. Now I'm in deep shit. My mom! Oh no, my dad's coming! Welcome, dad. Here, let me kiss your hand. What happened, why'd you come? - I don't know. They called and I came. If you didn't do anything then why did I get this telegraph? Why did I leave work and come this far then? - How should I know, mom? Ask Teacher Mahmut. - Come on. Be quiet. You must have been involved in something. Tell me. What did you do? Did you run away from school or did you do something even worse? - Welcome everyone. - Thank you. I'm the vice principal of this school. My friend is our literature teacher... ...Ms. Semra. I hope you don't mind, since we don't have a meeting room... ...we brought you in here. But this class is also a special one. Your children sat in these rows for years. I'm guessing that this is the first time you're seeing it. - Or am I mistaken? - You were right, vice principal... ...we could barely find the school. - I barely found it as well. I came once before. When? I think ten, twelve years ago I came to enroll... ...my son in middle school. - I understand. I guess you're all wondering why I called you here. I called you away... ...from all your work for two reasons. Today we are handing out the... ...students' report cards. You'll see from their grades that your children... ...are unfortunately doing poorly. Of course this is due to not studying... ...and laziness. But this is also true: This isn't a perfect school. ...And we aren't perfect teachers. Maybe we weren't good enough... ...for them. But what about you? Are you not at all to blame... ...for the poor performance of your children? Until now... ...have you given them enough attention? - What are you saying, sir... ...what do you mean to pay attention? I did everything for him. Of course. What else should I have done? He's a grown man. I sent... ...him all the way to Istanbul, to private schools, spent tons of money... ...with the hope that he would study. - His friends finished university... ...and he's still crawling through high school. Still, if he needs clothes, we'll... ...get him the best. - If he wants money, we send it. - He doesn't have to ask twice. My son always stays in class. I've never hit him even once. I'll slap him. Sometimes a lot. But I also love him. He's my son. I know. Of course you all love your children. But that isn't what I meant. Look back and think about it a bit. Since elementary school, how involved were you in your child's education? Did you ever try to be their friend, to understand them, their worries, their... ...problems, did you try to help them? What have you done to help them... ...become good people for their teachers, or mothers and fathers, that's you... ...in fact, for their country? Did you remind them of their duties and... ...responsibilities? A child doesn't learn by being sent to school with... ...a bag, by being given money and dropped off on the corner. Or rather... ...the parents' job doesn't end here. That's why, in my opinion, there is... ...no lazy, wrong, or guilty child. There are wrong and guilty parents. That's why these report cards are not for your children but I actually find... ...it more suitable to give them to you. The grades inside aren't just for... ...their classes but in some sense they're also your parenting grades. Before passing out the grades there is one other important issue. Your children committed a serious offense. My friend here will tell you... ...what the offense was and what their punishment will be. Yes dear. They are not to blame for anything. - What happened in there, dad? - What else, son? We talked to your... ...teacher and they gave your grades. - Then did nothing else happen? - What else would happen? - Like a punishment or something? No, son. We were given a lot of advice. I was thinking about it and your teacher is right. Where have I been all these years? Why haven't I paid attention to you? - Please, dad. - No, it's true. If I had done my job as a dad maybe things would have turned out differently. Oh well, it's too late for that. Watch and see how good of a dad I'll be for you now. You acted like a noble teacher, my dear. Thank you for confirming... ...my original impression of you. - Thank you. But I didn't do anything. - I just tried to act like you. - Ms. Semra. The Rascals Class sent you these roses. They thank you very much. Teacher, you forgave us, but we can't forgive ourselves - Rascals Class - Teacher Mahmut. - What is it this time? - We came to say goodbye to you. - We're leaving the school. Didn't you hear? Ms. Semra forgave you. We heard. We decided on our own to leave. - Why? - Because, sir, from the first day, we acted... ...very wrongly and offensively towards Ms. Semra. And despite all of that, she was able to nobly forgive us. We decided to reciprocate. Ms. Semra forgave each of us individually. But not the Rascals Class. So we thought the best thing to give her would be to get rid of... ...the Rascals Class altogether. - This is why we're leaving. - Why don't you say the Rascals Class is committing suicide? - Yes, sir. - Open the door, Mr. Veysel. - Why should I open it? What do you mean? We're leaving the school Pull the other one. I won't. Please, Mr. Veysel. We're leaving. Is this your latest prank for running away from school? Then how can we leave? I don't know. Go get permission from Mr. Mahmut and I'll open. Okay, let's go get permission then. The bell rang. Didn't you hear it? You're all late again. Come on, go to class.
