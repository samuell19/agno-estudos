It's me. It's Christmas tomorrow, and I thought maybe you and I could... Share Max. Uh, I haven't seen him since your high school reunion, which was fine, totally fine. I just thought maybe he would like to spend Christmas with me. Ho, ho, ho. Secret Santa time. Enjoy. Oh, and I got you something. Nothing big. Call me. Let me know if we can meet. That's it. Bye. ( Sighs ) ( Sighs ) ♪ ♪ No. Hey, I have a question. Would a guy... Stop. Would a guy like the new Nicholas sparks book for Christmas? Absolutely, fav book ever, totes. No, no way. Buy him beer. Man: Yeah, beer. Merry Christmas. Come with me. Oh, I have this one at home. You know what I got from my secret Santa? Huh? Jam. Oh, jam is good. Jam is a total re-gift. It's the thought. There was no thought. I like jam. It was from you. No. Oh, my god! It was! You gave me jam?! I forgot about the secret Santa thing! I panicked. I grabbed the first thing that I could find on the way out the door. Socks would've been better. Well, your real present is coming tomorrow. I'm sorry. I was distracted. Distracted by what? The holidays. Meaning Jack. I called him today. You holiday dialed your ex-boyfriend? What? It's like drunk dialing without the alcohol. Are you gonna help me find him a present or not? ( Sighs ) Okay. How do you know he's even gonna wanna see you? It's Christmas. We love Christmas. You are not a "we" anymore. I think we can be. I think given the amount of time that we've had apart, that we can get everything back on track. It's all part of the... Oh, don't say it. Please don't say it. Plan. No one has a life plan. Lots of people do. Not like you. You date for two years, you get engaged year three, wedding year four. In those four years, I secure myself at work, laying the groundwork for an extended maternity leave. I think it's a great plan. ( Chuckles ) Seriously, do you hear yourself? Right now, I need to find him a gift before 5:00. I thought you hadn't set a time. We didn't. I just have a blind date at 5:00. You have a blind date and you're meeting Jack? You're nuts. Trust me, the blind date isn't going anywhere. How can you say that? You haven't even met him. I don't need to. It's a mercy date. Sally, my dad's lady friend, he's her godson. I promised I'd have a quick drink, and then we're going to dad's house for dinner. Their house? Sally's more than a lady friend. They're married. Only in the eyes of the law. ( Sighs ) Sally is with your dad. Her taste in men can't be all bad. Can't you just give the godson a chance? What about this? It's $225. Nothing says Christmas miracle like cashmere. I'm out. I love you, you're my best friend, but I cannot enable your addiction. Addiction to you, plucky optimism to me. You'll see, after tonight, things will go back to the way it was. ( Sighs ) I'm gonna go back to the office party. Why? You have pluck and a blind date on Christmas Eve, and I have... Brian from payroll and a two-for-one coupon for curry in a hurry.

No. Oh, sorry, wrong blind date. Katie? Kate. Sorry. Sally said... Call me Katie. Yeah, we're working on that. Miles Dufine. Kate Stanton. Is this okay? Sure. Great choice on the local, by the way. Oh, actually, Sally recommended you and the bar. A woman of impeccable taste. Yeah. I order you a lager, by the way. Oh, I... I actually hate beer. It's a lager. Is there a difference? Not much. Yeah, I've tried beer like a million times, and it always tastes so bitter. I don't like anything carbonated, like soda or champagne. Okay, Kate, Kate, it was a shot in the dark. I mean, this is a bar. There's lots of choices. Go ahead. Take a chance. Try something new. All right. White wine, please. ( Sighs ) ( Both chuckle ) This is going well. Not the least bit awkward. Yeah. So Sally says you're in advertising. Mm-hmm. Did you have anything to do with those talking baby ads? No. Well, that's good. They were totally overrated. I'm working on a car campaign. What a coincidence. I own a car. It must've been because of your commercial. I work in print. And when I say commercial, I mean in 2-d. ( Chuckles ) Thanks. Thanks. So what do you do, miles? Jet fighter and hockey player. Oh, I made you look. ( Chuckles ) Sorry, I'm just waiting for a call. You fly jets? No, but I do play hockey. Maybe you've heard of me... Miles "rocket" Dufine, Staten island senior league? I might've let my season pass expire. No worries, I can totally hook you up with some sick seats... Right next to the penalty box. ( Chuckles ) ( Phone rings ) Oh, I'm so sorry. Hello? What? My place? Hold on. So something came up all of a sudden, and I need to go, but can I just meet you at my dad's for dinner later? Why? It's not important. Well, it seems like you're breaking our date. That's sort of important. No, I'm not breaking our date. I'm just rearranging it. Is it an emergency? Who's on the phone? Jack, my ex-boyfriend. Go. Really? Sure. Yeah, go. Okay. Merry Christmas, Katie. You, too. Wait, I'll see you at my dad's, right? Oh... Uh-uh. So, 15 minutes? Yeah, I'll see you there. Great! ( Siren wails in distance ) Kate. Smile. If you still love me, you'll smile. Merry Christmas, Jack! Merry Christmas. Mwa. Mwa. Oh! I, uh... I don't have much time. I got you something! Oh. I wish you hadn't. Well, you must've been wishing for something or you wouldn't be here. Well, I didn't want you to be alone. I knew it! I brought Max. That's great! Then the three of us can spend Christmas together! ( Barks ) Nancy, this is Kate. Kate, this is Nancy. Hi. Hi. It's nice to meet you. ( Barking ) Oh, Max! Did you miss me? Did you miss me? I missed you so much! Nancy and I are going to the cabin tonight, so we brought you Max. Wait, what? Oh, I'm kinda cold. I'm gonna just wait in the car. Nancy's my girlfriend. Since when? Well, we went to high school together, and when I went back to the reunion, we reconnected. I've known her forever. Is it serious? Don't do this, Kate. Do you love her? Yeah. I'm sorry. Look, I feel... You can keep it. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. ( Car door shuts, engine starts ) ( Sighs ) It's a shame your sister and brother couldn't make it tonight, but Mandy and John will be here in the morning with the kids, and we can call Phil at his girlfriend's house. Where does her family live? Ohio? Iowa. Iowa. I always get those confused. Aw, I wish we had a full house tonight. You know, it's a good thing you're single, Katie, or we'd just be two old folks having dinner alone tonight. You're spending the night, right, to be with the kids when they get here? You know, like it used to be? Dad, nothing is like it used to be. If it was, mom would still be alive. ( Phone rings ) I'll get it. Is this what the rest of my life is gonna be like? Just me and the dog? ( Whispering ) I think you hurt Sally's feelings. I didn't mean to, but don't you miss mom? Every day. But, honey, I love Sally, too. I wish you'd try a little harder with her. Maybe if you got to know her a little better. Dad, when mom died, you lost your wife, and you found someone to replace her. That's great, but I can't replace a mother. Sally's not a replacement. If you could just see her for who she is, I think you'd find a place for her. That was miles. He's not coming. He said you left him to be with another guy. Well, I went to go meet Jack. Who knew he had hooked up with some cheerleader from childhood? What? What? Yeah, I mean, I don't know if she was really a cheerleader, but she did look like one. Miles is one of the sweetest guys in the whole world. Well, I'll call him tomorrow and apologize. Oh, hon, that ship has sailed. You blew your chance. You can't go back and change it. I'm gonna be alone forever. ( Whimpers ) I mean, don't take that the wrong way. ( Whimpering ) ( Whimpers ) Woman: Fresh from the pear tree, a gorgeous partridge pin and pear earring ensemble.

Yeah. Merry Christmas! You weren't very nice to that lady. She's just my neighbor. She gave me the same thing yesterday. What are you talking about? Nothing. ( Beep ) Hey, hi. It's miles... Oh, god! It's a dream! It's gotta be a dream! That's what I was talking about. Quit looking backward to changing things with Jack. It's all ahead of you. Life is a dream. Oh, my god! You're right! Wow! You kinda feel real for a dream. ( Sighs ) You really need a day off. I can do anything in a dream. I can act anyway I want. ( Laughs ) In my dream, Jack doesn't drive off with Nancy! I can stop him! Who's Nancy? His cheerleader-looking girlfriend. Since when? Two months. But they've known each other since high school. When did he tell you this? Yesterday. Or actually he hasn't yet. And he won't have to when I show up like this. Well, if anything can change his mind, it's that outfit. What about your blind date? Damn, I deleted his number. Sally was pissed I had to leave. And if I don't show up, I'll never hear the end of it. And he is a nice guy. Who is? Miles, my blind date. He's a decent guy. The date you've never met is a nice guy. Now you're getting it. Go with it. I am. Rectangles. Okay. ( Indistinct chatter ) Phyllis? No. Hello, miles. You must be Katie, I'm hoping. It's Kate. I still hate beer, by the way. Listen, I want you to tell me one thing, and I want you to be honest. I like a woman who cuts through the B.S. Fire away. Have you met me before? I don't think so. Take a real close look. Mm... You smell nice, like honey. Honey doesn't have a smell. So I don't look familiar? Nope. But you look pretty. Thank you. There's nothing better than a woman with style. Listen, my phone is gonna ring. My wife had great style. I'm gonna have to take this call. Even though she was going to the market... And then I'll have to go... Your wife? What do you mean, you have to go? You're married? ( Phone rings ) Hi, Jack. I'll meet you in 15 minutes. My place. Yeah, see you there. Right. You're leaving? You're married? Who are you meeting? My boyfriend. Sally did not say anything about a boyfriend. Likewise. The whole wife thing seemed to slip her memory. I asked her not to say anything. Okay, then this is my subconscious working overtime. Really? Okay, well, this is my conscience thinking this was a bad idea. Nice, meeting you Kate. At least Sally won't blame me this time. Oh, you do this a lot? Apparently just with you. Ugh! ( Exhales deeply ) ( Phone rings ) Hi, dad. Ah, hi, Katie. I'm not gonna be able to make it tonight. Oh, no. Tell Sally it's Iowa, not Ohio. Okay. Can I talk to her? Sure. You're not coming? You might've mentioned that miles had a wife. He told you about Laura? Yes. How could you set me up with a married guy? His wife is dead, Katie. She died about a year ago. Kate? If you talk to him, tell him I'm really sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I will. ( Sighs ) So that means you're not coming? I have to go. Bye. ( Beep ) ( Sighs ) Jack: Kate? Ah. Merry Christmas, Jack.

No. So just the two of you? Yeah. Oh. Why? I'm... I'm, uh... Are you going to propose? Yes. ( Sighs ) You're the first person I've told. Just saying that just makes it feel so much more real. Oh. Kate, you're freezing. Here. Take my coat. Thanks. ( Barks ) Oh, uh, Nancy, this is Kate. It's nice to meet you. You, too. We should probably get going. Yeah, me, too. I have a date. You do? Mm-hmm. Cute guy. Christmas Eve. Whole world of possibilities. That's great. I'm so glad for you. Here, Max. Come on, boy. Merry Christmas. You, too. Oh, Kate... Sorry, I just need my coat. Oh, right.

Because I keep reliving the same day over and over. Well... It's not a dream! I'm... I'm sorry. I... I don't understand. I keep reliving Christmas Eve... This Christmas Eve. It's like a skipping record. I'm in bed, I'm watching TV, then all of a sudden, midnight comes around, and then whoosh, I'm back in the cosmetic department, I wake up, and this old man is looking at me. Okay, here's the thing. I don't think you have a brain tumor. I think what's happening is you're experiencing some very typical holiday anxiety. It's not typical holiday anything. Okay, your subconscious is trying to tell you that something has to change. And if you don't change it, then it's like living the same day over and over. Are you the type of person who makes a plan and then sticks with it? No. Well, if you were that type of person, you might feel anxious if things were changing around you. What is the one thing in your life you wish you could change? Get Jack back. I would seriously analyze that word "back." Back isn't change. Listen, I'm going to get Jack back, and everything will be fine. Well, just in case, take a couple of these before you go to bed, and you will wake up on Christmas morning. Are you sure? I guarantee it. ( Indistinct ) ( Door buzzes ) Yeah, thanks. Looks good. Busy day? Hey, Kate. No, just last minute Christmas shopping. Did you get me something? I'm kidding.

What do you want, Kate? What do I... What do I want? I want... I want... I want what you and Nancy have. You just have to be open to new experiences, new people. I don't need new experiences. I need to find a guy who will give me his coat when it's cold out. You worry too much. You'll find him. Yeah, the question is, will he find me? Maybe he already has. Look, I gotta go.

Do you mind if I join you? On the fried cheese, not the date. Sure. So... ( Clears throat ) Who's the girl? A friend of a friend. Oh, so it's a blind date, huh? Yeah, first in a long time. Thanks. I hear she's kind of amazing. Doesn't cook, though. She said that? How'd you know it was a she? Well, women set women up, you know. If a guy sets up a woman, the girl kinda comes across like a reject, and you wouldn't wanna be with a reject. So she said she didn't cook? Yeah. Doesn't matter, though. My wife couldn't boil an egg. I did all the cooking. You know, my... My late wife, I should say. Just so you know, I... I didn't know she died. Oh, no, it's okay. I mean, we just met. ( Chuckles ) Yeah. Hmm. Can I ask what happened? Yeah. It's no great lifetime channel tragedy. We have, well... I have a house in the country. It's a cottage, really. Uh, anyhow, she was up there alone at the time. She decided to clean the gutters. She fell off the ladder, and I came back from the store a half-hour too late. I'm so sorry. Thank you. It's been almost a year. It must be hard during the holidays. Oh, hence the desperate blind date. ( Laughs ) You don't seem so desperate. Mm. And that whole lifetime reference, pretty impressive. ( Chuckles ) Oh, you like how I slipped that in. Yeah, it's very evolved for a hockey player. How did you know I play hockey? ( Chuckles ) I didn't. Just a wild guess. I should go. No good? I'm not really that hungry anymore. That's too bad. Really? Yeah, I mean, it's rare that you bond over a mozzarella stick. ( Chuckles ) Hey, if your date doesn't show up later, it may have nothing to do with you. It may have to do with the fact that she's not over her ex and she's still trying to figure out if she can make a life with him. Or maybe she got food poisoning from bad shrimp at her office party. Okay. It was nice meeting you. I'm miles, by the way. I'm... Staying a mystery. It was nice to meet you. ( Sighs ) ( Sighs ) Aw. Oh, hi. Thank you for the cake. It's delicious.

No. Good, then hand me a spatula. This is my Christmas ritual. No husband, no kids, so I bake. I used to mail the cakes to relatives, but I hate standing in line at the post office, so now I just send them Internet pears and I bake for my neighbors, like you. Oh, my. Not at home in the kitchen, are we? ( Chuckles ) Well, what was your first clue? Well, now's as good a time as ever to learn something. Do you know how to cream butter and sugar? Um... Do you know what butter and sugar are? Yes, I do. Okay, good. There's your butter. There's your sugar. One cup each in the bowl. You're gonna make these yourself. I don't know if that's such a good idea. I apparently have a reputation for not cooking. Reputations are just history in rumor form. You can change it. Put 'em in the bowl. Let's get bakin'. Okay. Not bad. Mm, a little dry. True. That's because I didn't share my secret with you... A couple of tablespoons full of honey. Now, if you could just do it without blowing up the kitchen. Anyway, this is from an organic farm in the Hudson valley. It makes a world of difference. Mmm! Honey does have a smell. You can keep that for the next time you make the cake. Thanks. Yeah.

We can give it a shot, and if you fade out, I'll make sure you get home before Santa visits. You have no idea how good that sounds. Here it is... The Christmas beast!

I might've been there. Hmm. I know this isn't gonna help that much, but someone once told me that you can change everything except the most important thing... Fate. Huh. You know, this...

Don't have low self-esteem. You mean like when you're in a relationship for two years, knowing after six months it's never gonna work out, but being too scared to move on or admit it to yourself?

Nancy seems like a great girl, not that I know her, but I know you love her, and that's all that's important. What? How do you... Don't ask me how I know. I do, and I'm fine with it. Actually, I'm great. Relieved, really. Thank you. Merry Christmas, Jack. Hey, wait... Do you wanna go get a cup of coffee? I kept thinking things would eventually click, but I knew after we went to California. That was six months after we met. I was hoping it would get better, but I knew it wouldn't. I just thought that if we had this timeline, that it would make things better or just keep us on track, but all I did was push you away from me. Kate, I took you to California to propose. What? You were gonna propose? Then your mom died. What does her dying have to do with proposing? When your mom died, you became obsessed about us getting married. I did not. Maybe a little. Yeah. Well, dad was so lonely, I didn't wanna end up like him. I didn't wanna be alone. You were more in love with the idea of marriage than you were with me. You knew that? Kinda obvious. Not to me. I'm glad I saw you today. Me, too. I should probably get going. Bye. Bye. ( Bell dings ) ( Laughter ) Okay, okay, what happens when St. Nick gets stuck in the chimney? Oh, this... Uh! He gets Santa Claus-trophobia. ( All laugh ) Oh, that's a dumb joke. No, it's not. You're funny. You think? Totally. You're funny, you're charming, and you put up with this guy. Well, yes, I do. What's for dessert? Ooh!, wait, wait, I have a surprise. Ah! ( Chuckles ) ( Gasps ) Wow! I made it! All of it! All by myself! Since when did you learn to bake? Since today. ( Laughs ) Sorry. It's an inside joke. Forget it. Who wants coffee? I'll help. I'll have some. You like him, don't you? Yes, I do. I'm just glad to see you're over Jack, that snake. He's not a snake. I know I told you he was, but he's not. He broke your heart. You know, it did crack a little, but it seems to be working just fine now. I actually saw him today. ( Sighs ) Did he do something? He didn't buy the ring. What? He didn't buy the ring. I went and saw him for coffee, and he never bought it. Oh, Jack isn't gonna propose! Who's Jack? Oh, her ex-boyfriend. ( Sighs ) And that's a problem? Yes. Miles... ( Sighs ) It's not what you think. Well, here's what I think. I think we had some kind of connection tonight, but... We did. We do. But as much as I try to explain it, it's gonna come out wrong. All right, try me. Okay, so there's this guy Jack, and he's fallen in love with this girl. Let's call her Nancy. Anyhow, Jack was gonna propose to Nancy, until he saw me today. This is supposed to help the situation? You were the one who said I couldn't change fate. When did I say that? Not tonight. Another Christmas Eve. ( Chuckles ) Look, I might be falling in love with you, and you might be falling in love with me, but if Jack doesn't propose, fate has changed, and this whole night will finally be over. That came out worse than I imagined. I think it would be best if we just said good night. I know this seems weird. Uh, you've only known me for six hours, and you're telling me you love me. Yes. Yeah, that qualifies as a little weird. I said I might be falling in love with you. Still too much, huh? Kate, you seem like a nice girl, but I'm not ready for drama. I've had enough in the last year. Your wife's death. I know. No, see, that's it. You don't know. You don't know me. I don't know you. No one's falling in love with anyone. It'll be different tomorrow. You'll see. It was nice to have met you, Kate. Call me. Good night. ( Sighs ) He's not gonna call me again. Miles was supposed to wake up knowing me and wanting to see me, not running away! My guess is that's not gonna happen, honey. ( Sighs ) Unless I can have one more night just like this. Dad, can I borrow your car? You have to propose to her. What the hell are you... I know you're having second thoughts, but you can do it. Ask her. Ask her. Are you drunk? No. Who is she? Kate. She's my ex. What is she doing here? He loves you. He wants to marry you. I know. I proposed an hour ago. But you didn't get the ring. What are you, the engagement police? I can propose without a ring. Well, yeah, but there's gonna be a ring, right? Yes, of course, babe, there's gonna be a ring. Maybe mile's is right. Maybe you can't change fate. And if you can't change fate, this will never end. She seems pretty upset. Maybe we shouldn't... Don't worry, I won't be here long. No, you can spend the night. I'll drive you back tomorrow.
