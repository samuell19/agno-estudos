It wasn't until the neighbors called in about the smell that they found the body. The torso was half chewed up by the cats. Right. That's why it's always important that you check in. It sounds like it's important to have a dog and not a cat. Yes, Dad. I promise, I will check in with you every single day. - Would that make you happy? - Yes. Okay. - I'm very proud of you. - Thank you. Your mom would be proud of you too. So cute. Oh, my God. - Put the weapon down, Becks. - Okay. - You guys take care of each other, okay? - Always. You know, I got her. Nothing's gonna happen. You realize nobody of your generation is gonna be able to run for office. - We don't want to. - I might. You know, I got a great face, loveable character... - That's not happening. - It's such a loveable character. - Bye, Dad. - Bye. Bye, Daddy. The fact that you talk about, like, procreating with my dad is... I just want to be in your family tree. I just want to be your stepmom. It'd be kind of sick. You'd have to be like... Why did I tell her the cat story? What the hell? Oh, my God! Holy shit! Nina! What are you doing here? I haven't seen you in 15 years. - You look great. - Thanks. You too. You better... It was good seeing you, Cole. You too. - Someone's got a new man. - He kind of looks like... Here's my badge. You want to see the gun too? Sorry, Officer. My bad. - Yeah? - We found the lab. Do we wait? No, we don't wait. We go tonight. All right. Meet us at the warehouse. Backup is on the way. If we wait, he's gone. Let's go get this guy. - Oh, shit. Don't shoot. - Freeze. Please, I've got kids. Please, please. Where's Hernandez? In the other room. Please let me go. I got nothing to do with this shit. - Get the fuck out here. - Please. Vincent Hernandez, you're under arrest! Freeze, do not move! - Put that thing down! - Freeze, goddamn it! - They're running! - Fuck you, pigs! Put the fucking knife... Put it down! I said, stop! You're gonna shoot me? Get against the fucking pole! Get against the fucking pole. - Stay right against this fucking pole. - I ain't telling you shit! A little bad cop. Hey, hey, hey, stop! Against the table. You're under arrest. - Hands behind your back. - Babe! - Babe! - Stop it right now. Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up. You got him? Let me go or I slit this fucker's throat! - No, no, no. - No, no, no, no! Let me go! I'm gonna fucking kill him! - Drop the knife and let him go! - Let me go now! - Drop the knife! - Let me go! - That's not happening. - Let me go! Let me go! Put the knife down! Drop that knife and let him go! I'm gonna slit his throat! No! Fuck! Oh, shit! Fuck! Holy shit! You reap what you sow, boy. Shut the fuck up! You reap what you sow! Shut the fuck up! Suspension. Pending an IA investigation. Hey, you wanna grab a drink? Yeah, alone. Are we the only ones here who literally know no one? I'm no one. Okay, that's fine. I see how it is. - I wasn't talking about you, B. - Childhood best friend. I know, and that's the beauty of it. I can let the whole slept-with-a-teacher... couple-teachers thing go, and you can let the whole detective's daughter, strait-laced virgin... - All right, I get it. - Okay, okay. Hey, we should do that. Instant social life, instant friends. - Instant liver damage? - Yes, but Phi Lambda is the dream. I mean, look at them. It'd be like if Victoria's Secret was a sorority. Aren't sororities kind of pretentious? Fuck, yes, you have to pay to get in. But you'll get us in, because you can be the virgin that they sacrifice and I can be your slutty plus-one. I think I'm good. Wait, wait. Carter West totally just checked you out. No, see what I mean? We're so joining. I'm not taking no for an answer. We're doing it. How can humans do horrible things? Like commit genocide or torture... one another. Does free will exist? Or are we simply driven by our environment, our biology, our non-conscious influences? What is consciousness? Or the notion of self? Phi Lambda is having pledges over for Rush Week on Friday. - Oh, Becks... - No, we're going. - Okay, we can just see what it's like. - Okay. Father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. Born 1856 in Austria... and he came up with a theory... Just so you know... Carter West likes Phi Lambda girls. Anyone know what that is? What's your name? We all do things, also... that we know we shouldn't be doing. Why do we do it? That bad, huh? It's... Yeah. Yeah. Sororities aren't for everyone. Though some of these girls take it way too seriously. Yeah, most of those girls need to get their heads examined. Easy now, my sister went there. It's the only reason I got this sweet job. Your sister has to get you jobs? No... It's not that bad, though. I mean, I'm a valet at a party that almost everybody walked to. And it beats moving kids into the dorms, so... So, you gonna pledge? I don't know. I like a lot of the girls, but tonight's been a lot. Oh, my God, there you are. Okay, I did it. I'm amazing, I got us in. - To what? - Zeta opening rush. Basically, one giant rager along the entire Row. Best day of your life. We're going. - I'm sorry, we got to go. - Bye. I hooked up with the hottest guy. It's the treasure, like it's... I'm not gonna go to a pool party by myself. Names. Hi. Becks Power and Riley Cole. AJ put us on the list for this... You got to be kidding me. It looked lame anyway. Yeah, that's fine. Whatever. Let's just go. Just you two. Oh, my gosh, Becks. This is insane. This is insane! AJ, how are you? - This is Riley. - Hi. - Don't be shy. - One for you. - You want a drink? - Thank you. Yes, of course. Follow me. - How you doing? - I'm always good. - Vodka? Tequila? - Vodka. Vodka. Chaser? Yes, no? - Cranberry? - Pineapple. - Pineapple? - Yes. Why pineapple? You should look it up. Let's check. - Pineapple juice? - Yes! You are such a sick shit! I'm a sick little slut. What is up, brother man? How's it going? - You want a shot? - Yeah, hit me up. No, no, no! These are not gonna work. - Perfect. Thank you so much. - There you go. And this is for you. - How's that? - Perfect. - Good? - Thanks, thanks. Brains and beauty should always be rewarded. It's rare. And freshmen getting asked to come to upper-class Psych doesn't go unnoticed. Nor does... Well, you know, how you look. - Okay, we need a stronger drink. - Yeah, yeah. All right. To the Row. - To... - Getting fucked up at college! Go get in the pool! Let's do this! - You got in? - My friend Becks got us in. - You're Riley Cole, right? - Yeah. I'm Celeste Aster, Chapter President. This is Ana. She's kind of my right hand. - Hi. - What's up? This is Phi Lambda! It's kind of our job to know that your mom was part of Phi Lambda. - She was? - Yeah. Chapter President '89, I think. Wait, you didn't know? There's a lot I don't know about my mom. She died when I was seven. But that seems a little intense for a party like this. We really think you're Phi Lambda material. Yes. - You wanna have a real drink? - Yes. Bring it on. Hey. Can we talk about this? Carter, I saw you with that chick. You know, I thought this time with me, it would be different. You're supposed to know how this works. You're right. Isabel. Wait. Leave me the fuck alone, Carter. I said, I don't want to talk! Come on, what is this? What the fuck? Please. I'm still alive, Dad. Just checking in. How'd you spend your first weekend on campus? Just stayed in with Becks. Who? How's work? It's... same as ever, busy. You got a dog yet? I'm thinking about it. Dad, did you know that Mom was a part of a sorority called Phi Lambda? Dad! Yeah, I'm here. I thought you said that Mom hated sororities. I doubt I said that, I'm... I'm on a case, Riley. I got to go. I'm busy. Right. - I love you. - I love you, bye. Ladies, welcome to Phi Lambda. You bad bitches are the chosen few who have been selected to take the next step towards initiation. But now you can relax. No hazing. Tonight is about getting a little drunk. And most of all, it's about having fun. So to tonight's new sisters! Or are you trying a small on? She looks just like you. I can't believe she was here. Becks, she was here, in this house. There's a lot I don't know about her. Maybe you're meant to be here. Maybe joining Phi Lambda is a way of reconnecting with her or something. This way, ladies. Maybe it's body shots? This way. Keep following me. Keep it going. Keep it moving. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. So, like, we lied about the hazing. You dumb shits actually believed it, didn't you? Strip, bitches! Okay, you'll have two minutes to hide. When you're found, you'll be subjected to, shall we say, further trials. But the last pledge to be found will be granted exemption from these trials. So, let the games begin! Run, bitches! Sorry. Go! Fucking disgusting. Choose one. Gross! Get the fuck out! - Can I at least have my clothes? - You can have your phone. Go take a selfie in front of Zeta and then you can stay. Go! Come on, now. You choose one. And who are we missing? Hello? Is anybody in here? Hello? I know you're in here. Hello? Thank God. Thank God you're okay. - You're okay, right? - Yeah. Come home with me till we figure out what's going on here? Yeah, I want to go home. Okay, good. I'm gonna go inside and see how everything's going in there, and then we'll get you out of here. - Okay. - You stay with her? Yeah, of course. Okay. Give me a couple of shots over here. Are you sure you want to go home? You didn't see her face, Becks. She won't be the last. I agree. This took work. The sick fuck is probably just getting started. Hey, boss, Ellingham is on her way. I got to go anyway. I got to get Riley home. But I want in on this, are we clear? Goddamn it, Cole. You're suspended. - What the fuck are you doing here? - Just leaving, ma'am. You have no idea what position I'm in. I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm gone. You got suspended? - When did that happen? - The day I dropped you off. When are you gonna start being honest with me? I'm your kid. There are girls in there who are complete strangers and they're telling me more about my mom than you ever have! - Can we talk about this at home? - I'm not going home. Ellingham wants me to take you to your car. I'm talking to my daughter. Give me a second. I'll be fine, Dad. I have friends here. Now, Cole. Let's go. - Fuck. - Come on. Keep moving. Riley. - Sorry. Didn't mean to frighten you. - It's okay. Yeah, we're all on edge. - Did you happen to know Isabel? - Yeah, sort of. I'm glad to see you're focusing on your studies. It's good to stay busy at a time like this. - This was decent. - Really? Thank you. You have a surprisingly solid grasp of psychology for a freshman. Well, my dad is a detective. So he kind of raised me to read people. He was relentless when I brought a boy home. Make sense. You know, I teach an advance level Criminal Psych class. Serial killers, criminal profiling. It's normally for seniors, but... - Think about it for next semester. - Will do. You're a capable student. I'd like to see how far you can go. Sometimes we... we get together in a group. We order pizza. If we're feeling really crazy, we... - crack open some root beer. - I'll keep it in mind. - Professor Villiers? - Petra! Let's go to my office. - Take care, Riley. - See you. - What did he want? - Nothing. I brought you something. - What? - Something... - Class of '89. Is my mom in here? - Check it out. Tonight we're honoring Isabel. We're all gonna just meet up at Randy's. It's the main bar we all hang out at. Will you come? Yes. Her computer looks like she's on all the usual social media. We're going through it all but there's one thing I found interesting. - Tell me. - There's one app she constantly used. It doesn't have a name, just a Greek symbol. Row. And none of our guys here have ever heard of it. Not even the techs. They can't even recover the data. Can't you just download it yourself? Well, I tried. It's not on the App Store or Android. The only thing I found on it was some dark-web rumor blog. Apparently, you need to be invited with some access code. Some llluminati-type shit. Run it down. What? Kind of fun. You've been here before? I've heard about things. - You've heard about Randy's? - Yeah, I've heard about Randy's. Hi. - How are you? - I'm good. - Hey, girls. - Hi, Riley. I got ditched for a boy, quickly. What game are you playing? Row. It's like Greek Tinder. You have to be in a sorority or a frat and be invited. You won't find that anywhere. Not for pledges. Right here. And I have party favors. I love you! Just one. I got you, here. Thank you very much. Here we go. Okay. - One for you. - Okay. Ready? To Isabel. - To Isabel! - Isabel! - Wait, what is this? - What? - It's Molly. - Molly. Magic Molly. I think I'm just gonna drink. - No! - What? Listen, you only live once. This is college. Have a little fucking fun! Have a little fucking fun! We treat you so nice. I'm telling you. You okay? We really have to stop meeting like this. This is not my scene. - Okay. - You good? - I'm Miller, by the way. - Riley. Nice to meet you, Riley. Hey. Excuse me. Excuse me, you can't go in there. Calm down, fun police. I'm not driving. I just need these to get back into my apartment. Is that okay with you? I'll be back for the car tomorrow. Feel free to wax it. Fucking drunk girls. Unbelievable. I got to go home. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy, easy. Okay, all right. What are you doing? I'm going home. What, you think you're gonna drive? Yeah. Yeah, I'll drive you. Thanks. I'll be back in, like, 15. - Hey, it's Riley. Leave me a message. - Shit. Hey, for the record, I hardly called my parents when I was in college. Was there a killer loose at your college? Good point. Keep calling her. You know you're not supposed to be working this case. Yeah, well, let them try and stop me. It's my kid's school. I'm gonna head to the office, see what I can dig up there. Just don't let Ellingham catch you. Sees her as an object. A doll he can play with any way he wants. Wakey, wakey. Oh, wait. Easy, easy, hey. Wait, Riley, hang on. You forgot your bag. Riley, your bag, your keys. Fuck. You okay? - You all right? - I'm okay. - I'm okay. - You forgot your bag. And your keys. Does that look like an apartment key to you? Yeah, yeah, they're short. Hey, listen... What do you think about doing something that doesn't involve puking and frat parties with a humble valet guy like me? You don't think I look hot when I puke? Put your number in that phone. I think you look good. Call me. Wait. No, you have my number. You got to call me. You got it? Carter? Carter! I know you're in there. Oh, my God. My head is literally pounding. Tell me about it. Oh, my God. Where were you last night? We were looking everywhere for you. I drank way too much liquor and ended up puking in the bushes all night. You got off easy. Ana threw up in my purse. Gross! Fucking fun, right? Do you guys care if I check out more of your book stuff? Help yourself. Thank God the pizza is here. Pledges, get the door! So loud! Do you want to get it? God... Hi. Oh, my God. I didn't know anyone was in here. I almost just wet my pants. Sorry. I don't think we've met. I'm Riley. Nina. I'm the house mother. - Class of '91. - I saw your picture in the hall. Wait, '91. Did you know my mom? Margaux Cole? - You're Margaux's daughter. - Yeah. Yeah, I knew your mom, somewhat. That's amazing. Would you mind looking at this? In every other picture I've seen of her she looks so happy, but in this one, it's just... I don't know, she seems different. Do you know why? I don't know. I have to get going. So... It was nice meeting you, Riley. Please. There's so much that I don't know about her. If you know anything, it would mean the world to me. It would mean so much to me. It's really not my place, Riley. Maybe you should talk to your father. My dad? You know my dad? I do. I did know him. Look, I... I probably shouldn't even be saying this, but... let's just say Margaux wasn't the nicest girl in the sorority. Hey, Nina. Where are all the Psych 120 papers? Excuse me, Riley. What did my mom do? Something happened at Phi Lambda and I want to know what it was. - Riley! - Enough! Start being honest with me! Your mother was involved in a hazing incident. One of the girls couldn't handle it. - She killed herself. - Are you fucking kidding me? I don't know any of the details. Your mother refused to talk to me about it. But trust me, Riley, your mother felt horrible. Everybody makes mistakes. Who keeps something like that from their kid? - Who does that? - She's your mother! How am I supposed to tell you that? Answer your phone, Dad. It's what you fucking do best. Riley! Riley! Riley! Grey. Uh-huh. All right. I'm on my way. First the arms and now the legs. What's he doing with the body parts? I'm sure you'll enlighten us, Cole. - How did you get here so fast? - I was in the neighborhood. Returning to the crime scene, huh? Check her phone. The Row will be on there. Call me when you're done here. - Okay. - He's making his own doll. It's a somber night here at Vanternin State University, where earlier today, 21-year-old Laura Townsend was found murdered. Detective Cole, do you believe this could be the work of a cannibal? - Detective! One question. - One question. Detective Cole! Nina. What did you say to my daughter? She told me who she was and I panicked. Why didn't you just say something to her yourself? It's not that simple. No. No, it isn't. Nothing's ever simple, is it? - Hi. - Hey. - Thank you for coming. - Of course. You... feel like getting something to eat? Sorry. It's probably not the best time for a first date. No. No, I just... I need to go back to the sorority for a little bit and then... we can go. You sure that's safe? Celeste hired an armed guard. So I'm sure it's the safest place right now. Yeah. I don't know. Wanna grab a drink? Maybe talk about it? No. Thank you. - Then just text me, and I'll pick you up. - All right, I'll see you in a little bit. All right. Why are you staring at my daughter? You're Riley's father? Nice to meet you, Mr. Cole. - I'm Miller. - It's Detective Cole. Which means I'm armed. Glad to hear it, sir. Makes me feel better to know that somebody is looking after Riley. Are you even a student here? School of Hard Knocks. Boo-fucking-hoo. I see where Riley gets her sense of humor from. Easy, kid. We're not friends. Wow. Riley, I'm sorry. That's a lot to find out about your mom. Yeah. Maybe... I don't know. Maybe we can't really judge her, you know? We've all done mean and petty things to other people. I guess the hope is that we learn from our mistakes and we move on. Thank you. Do you remember that night at the bar that I was shit-faced? Yeah. Yeah. I know that I was hammered. But I think Laura went home with Carter. Carter? Did you tell your dad? No, because if I tell my dad it's Carter and it's not, I could ruin his whole life. I don't know. I think it's better safe than sorry on this one. You look so good tonight. Thank you. I got it from here, kid. Dad! - I had a really good time tonight. - Me too. - I'll see you later, okay? - No, you won't. No sleepovers tonight. That's... that's not what I meant, sir. Two girls turn up at Phi Lambda, and you're walking around like everything's normal, going out on dates with strangers. Miller is not a stranger and I happen to really like him, so... Really? What do you know about him? I know that he's a hard worker. I know that he works a valet job. He moves students into dorms. I know that he's saving up to get a college degree. And I know that he's nice to me. Plus, his sister was Phi Lambda, Dad. Enough with the Phi Lambda. I'm just saying, you should be happy that I'm finally getting some female influence in my life. Hey. Where are you going? Don't worry. I'll be safe. Are you sure? Yeah. - Thanks for the ride. - Riley, wait. I'm sorry. I should have told you about... well, more about your mother. I thought I was protecting you. I was wrong. There's something else. The fire that your mother died in... I don't think it was an accident. I think she set it herself. I didn't tell you this before... but the girl from the sorority that died... she set herself on fire. Your mother was still struggling... with the guilt and depression all those years. I think it finally just got the better of her. Why did you hide that from me? I... I thought... - What else are you hiding from me? - Nothing. I swear. Riley. Tell me we caught him. Laura Townsend had the Row too. Of course she did. I had a couple of our eggheads try to hack it. They said they'd never seen anything like it. The app completely wipes itself. Well, I'm waiting for the silver lining, Grey. Well, I figured we go straight to the source. We go to the app distribution server, we find the distributor ID. - So the assholes that created it? - Right. Let's get on it. Hey, Zach. Don't you fucking move. - What the fuck is this? - What do you know about the Row? I'll get you... Come on, man. I'm just the developer. I'll give you whatever you want. It wasn't me. I didn't do this. I didn't kill anyone. Come on. Can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah. Actually, I wanted to talk to you. Look, I want to apologize for the other day. What I said was really insensitive. I think I just got caught off-guard. I'm really tired of people not being honest with me. This page is torn out. Do you know what was on it? Nina, I am begging you. If you know something, please just tell me. Okay. All right. You deserve to know the truth. What I'm about to tell you... you can't say anything to the other girls or I'll deny it. I won't say anything. After the incident... the university forced us to whitewash history. They wanted to bury this story. - The Doll House? - Yeah, it's what we called Phi Lambda. The Doll House was way more than a nickname. Hazing back then, it was a whole other level. Before the Internet and cell phone cameras. It makes what you girls do today look like kindergarten. Because in order to earn one of those jackets... you had to do the Doll House ritual. Pledges had to drink until they dropped. Angie was the first to pass out, so that made her a target. We took her over to the Zeta house, where they took photos of her. I mean, it's not like they were gonna do anything to her. They propped her up like a rag doll and put her in positions. It was all innocent. Until Angie woke up midway, terrified. She was screaming and thrashing around, ran out of there. She thought the absolute worst had happened to her. She thought she had been raped. The point was to scare her and have a little bit of fun, but... her reaction was way over the top and... this wasn't funny anymore. I mean, we didn't know that she was on antidepressants. So she should never have had anything to drink in the first place. And none of us could have known that she was going to kill herself. It was pretty horrific. Becks, it's me. I really need you. Please answer your phone. Becks! This is my 500th time calling you. Please call me back, I need you. What are we doing? What? You want to know what I heard? I heard you're trying to be the first guy in Zeta history to sleep with every girl in Phi Lambda. Who told you that? I don't really care, Carter. It's just scratching an itch, right? Oh, my God! Ana? Is he gone? I waited as long as I could. Ana? Ana? Again, no sign of a break-in. Not from the front door, anyway. What an artist. Must have been interrupted by the roommate. See the girl in the living room? - What did he take from her? - Nothing. No body parts missing. No doll routine. Ana was Phi Lambda. The roommate, not yet. How do you know? - Just check it out. I'm sure of it. - Okay. Hey. Come with me. - I need you on this, Cole. - But... Just shut the fuck up and listen. We're gonna set up a nice, cozy dinner with the Commissioner, and then hopefully, he makes this IA jazz go away. Just get rid of this fucking serial killer before anything else happens. Yes, ma'am. Riley, thank God. Dad, I cannot find Becks anywhere. I've gone by her place twice now... Wait. Just relax. We'll find Becks. Stay put. Come on. - Still no answer? - Nothing. Okay. We're going in. Not again. How old are you? Becks. Put some clothes on and answer your damn phone. Okay. Only if it's you calling. - Is that your dad? - No, it's not my dad. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, my God. What, the shit dick? Don't mess up his face. I mean, I know... I understand you discovered this Row connection. Good work. It's not him. ...on campus and you're the only one... He had dates with all three victims on that fucking app. It's too easy. Doesn't make it wrong. - The app is a distraction. - For what? From the true link, Phi Lambda. Why the fuck are you with these girls... I'm not! I swear! - Why are they dying now? - I don't know, I don't know. - Why? - I don't fucking know! Follow your hunch... but I am not letting that little prick out. - Riley. - I heard about Carter West. You know him? A little bit. He left with Laura the night that she was killed. How do you know that? Because I was there too. I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you. But, Dad, I really don't think that Carter did this. Neither do I. When can I see you? Name a time and place. You can even bring that valet guy if you want. Really? - You know he has a name. - Sorry. I have trouble taking a kid seriously that uses his last name only. And I understand that, but Miller is his first name. How about tonight? We could come over, make you dinner. - Shit! - What? I've got a dinner with the Commissioner tonight. You know what, it's early, and I won't eat too much. - How's 8:00 sound? -8:00 is perfect. Okay, then. I'll see you then. Hey, you're late. I'll walk with you. So my first go round, I found three links to faculties and students. One being Riley, of course, and a Nina Baker, a Phi Lambda house mom. - She was a student from '88 to '91. - Okay, right. And an Alex Villiers. He's a psych professor. He was a freshman in '91. And was a Zeta. Can we track his phone movement? - We're already all over it. - All right. - Hey, Riley. - Hey, Professor V. Dinner with the parents? Something like that. My mother just moved out here. New couch. That's a big couch. Kill me now. See you. See you in class. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. - How are you? - Good. - You look nice. - Thank you. You're welcome. Something smells good. My dad and I have this ongoing cooking war, and I'm convinced tonight I'm gonna beat him. - Oh, yeah? - Yes. Where is your dad? He said he's running late but he should be here soon. What's in the bag? Did you bring me a gift? Yeah, yeah, something like that. Do you mind helping me set the table? Villiers checks out, GPS from his phone came back. Are you sure? Yeah. We're gonna bring him in anyway, but he looks clean. Okay, let me know what he says. Someone wouldn't have to break in... just make copies of their keys. You got a nice place. Thank you. We moved here after my mom died. Oh, yeah? After the fire? I told you about the fire? Yeah. At the dinner, remember? Sir? Sorry. I'm sorry. Angie Rakowski. I think she has a brother. Find out what his name is. What happened to your arm? Shark attack. Shark attack, okay. Okay, I don't know what to do with those, so... - I can handle this. - I'm gonna grab a beer. Yeah, just in the fridge. Jesus Christ. Angie Rakowski burned herself to death. Well, what about the brother? Parents died shortly before she did in a car accident. And a brother, Miller Rakowski. He's the killer, Grey. Shit. I'll send units to his house right away. - Track Riley's phone too. - Riley's phone? He's after Riley. Just do it. Come on, Riley. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Miller? Miller? - Miller Rakowski! - Police department! Miller Rakowski! - Miller Rakowski! - Police department, show yourself! Miller... Miller Rakowski, show yourself! He's not here. Clear! He's gone. Damn! Ain't no signs of him. Wait. We got keys. It's the truck outside. Let's go. Hey. Want to get that? Miller? Miller? Miller? - You did this? - Your fucking mother killed my sister. No, they were young. It was an accident. She humiliated her. In front of the entire fucking school. She was all I had! After your mother was done hazing her, Angie called me on the phone, and she was hysterical and wasn't making any sense. So I rushed to campus. And there she was in the middle of the quad, naked! She had doused herself with gasoline and lit a match! I watched... my sister burn. For what? For a fucking sorority? I fucking found out what they made her do. The fucking Doll House! Oh, the Doll House? The Doll House. I'm gonna show you a real motherfucking doll house. You think you can haze people? Oh, I can haze people. But I am gonna have way, way, way more fucking fun. I'm sorry. No. No. I'm afraid we're way past the point of apologies. Come here! Answer the phone, damn it! Shit. Get the fuck out of the car! Get out! Get on the ground! Answer the phone! Answer the phone! Hey, we're tracking Riley's phone. It looks like he took her to Phi Lambda. You're right around the corner. I'm gonna get units out right away. Get out of the fucking car. Get out! Get out! Get the fuck out. Get out of the fucking car! Stand down, he's mine. You can have me, Detective Cole. But I'll be covered in the blood of your daughter, holding her head in my fucking hands. Go ahead, man. Touch the gun, and I'll cut her goddamned head off, right here on the motherfucking Row. Maybe I'll do it anyway. That was the plan. Let her go! I'll kill you right here, right now. You sure about that, boss? Your hands look a little unsteady there. You sure you're not gonna hit your daughter like that fucking cop you shot? Whatever Margaux may have done to your sister, she was sorry. Sorry? Your apologies are useless! They're just fucking words! You're not the only one who lost somebody, Miller. Margaux killed herself too. Riley lost her mother. I lost my wife. You're just too fucking much. This is too fun. I'm the one who killed that bitch. I may not have known much when I was a kid, but I knew how to light a match and I knew how to cover my fucking tracks! And that should have been the end of it, but little fucking Riley here decided to follow in Mommy's footsteps and join the other zombie bitches of Phi Lambda. That's when I knew. Killing your fucking cunt of a mother... was not gonna be enough. It's over now. It's okay, baby. I'm sorry. Come here, my rushing queen. Soft hugs. There we go. I don't know what came over me. Okay. Okay, gimps. Let's cut the waterworks. We're gonna have a great year. We better. You are the first freshmen ever allowed to live in Phi Lambda. Not to mention your new street cred. We're the baddest bitches on the Row!
