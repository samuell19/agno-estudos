It was an accident It shouldn't have happened But we were very glad it did His name's Xin Yi He loved singing in corridors and listening to his own echo He wasn't interested in girls of his age but fell in love with a 40-year-old woman from his dad's plant He says when he was outraged he looked like a fat butcher Huang Qi was very smart But not for academics He wasn't cut out to be a doctor He fainted in the very first anatomy class All he thought about was his bimbo girlfriend Hou Pu was from a small village near Beijing He desperately wanted to be successful He often studied alone in the lab after class He was enamored with the human body Unfortunately he was still a virgin The accident was caused by Hou Pu That unusually warm early spring Hou Pu was obsessed with Wei Yan who didn't care much about him In the anatomy exam he first saw Wei Yan's... - The virgin Hou Pu probably had the strongest knee-jerk reaction in his life - Don't move. Don't move. Professor Bai, you're wet Hou Pu, you're doomed Don't blame me, Professor Bai It was an involuntary reaction What a coincidence! Your penis is soaked with formalin and may never be normal Change your pants now! Skull! Don't throw it to me. Find a jar! Don't steal anything If things go missing I will replace them with parts from your own bodies You're cruel, Professor Bai - Mandarin Duck Tea - Jasmine What're you doing? Clean up the mess What the fuck? Get to work - Professor Bai - What? How many skulls are there? 17, including yours Better find them all Listen Don't cheat or you will be in trouble I'm watching you. Any cheating will be caught - Understand? - Yes, sir! What just happened must not spread outside this class Professor Bai, it smells so bad. Let's take the exam tomorrow Shut up, take your seats! I'll give you 20 minutes more What are you doing there? Hurry up! Hurry up! The girl with big boobs was Huang Qi's girlfriend, Juan The girl without a smile was my girlfriend, Bai Lu fThey were our reserve troops for exams - What are you doing! - I'm sorry You're not liberal arts students If you fool around patients will be mistreated I'm telling you, Huang Qi If you become a doctor one day I would never let you treat me even I had a wart Ok, time's up Time's up I'm Qiu Shui Five years after I started medical school I could simultaneously write four martial arts novels All of them were unoriginal They looked like other masterpieces Average readers can't tell the difference - Xin Yi - What? Remember that prodigal swordsman's move? What's it called? Nine-Heaven Claw Subdued Devil You're fudging it, right? I misused it last time and got blamed by the publisher That bastard didn't pay me I'm not surprised Your books get more and more exotic - That's my style! - You have style? You're an airhead and a retard! Why am I helping you? - I'm not paid - Get out! Are we brothers if I pay you? Brothers? What are brothers? What are buddies?

Likewise, I see obscenity in every contemporary painting But Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 "Pathetique" is meaningful to me A love token ends in a relic Time flies I take the symphony as an artifact, a poem and a diary because it is related with a girl She is the first girl I embraced Grandpa Hu, didn't I have a call? - Brat, you're late - She hung up International call will be redialed in 5 minutes Drink it slowly It tastes strange It's Scotch I'll never like it The girl has a sweet voice like Teresa Teng's It's my sister Hu lived here for many years Half of all A-list Chinese doctors completed their studies during his term of service We all think that if they have sexual problems, such as asynodia or premature ejaculation, it's because of Hu Hu's a big fan of martial arts novels So am I Every book I wrote was read by him first Work harder and write more You're talented and smart You're better than the masters Much better Much, much better Hello, sister Another new boyfriend?

Everyone enjoys looking at beautiful women Tell me... What do you do? I'm a student A medical student Don't you believe me? Do I look too old? We study for eight years so we're older when we graduate Wrinkles multiply exponentially with age - Please - Thanks You said you're a medical student. I'm impressed - Is it hard to get into a medical school? - Of course Very few get admitted You have to be smart You should quit smoking It's harmful. I can take you to the anatomy lab and show you people who've died of smoking and what their lungs look like Are they dummies? No, real corpses Take me there sometime Okay Where do you live? Why are you asking that? Don't you know how to drink coffee? Let me teach you It's my first cappuccino in a five-star hotel It's too expensive Coffee is like girls Why? Some people like adding sugar to it to make it sweeter The girl would be sweeter I think girls're like alcohol The more you drink, the hotter you feel The more you drink, the higher you feel Girls're like that You are Qiu Shui, yes? - Dick? - Your sister's Dick My sister's boyfriend? Ah, come on, we're family Big hug! Big hug! It is good to see you Can you take a photo for me?

Different hemorrhage regions, speed and volume will lead to different clinical symptoms Intracranial pressure increases Eyeball movement slows down It can cause hemiplegia, even death Intracranial pressure increases Dizziness causes membrane damage I've seen many patients vomit violently - Why vomiting? - Because of the hemorrhage You're going to treat real patients after graduation people who are alive Cautiousness is very important Is frolicking being cautious? Studying medicine must be serious One false step could be a tragedy If you make mistakes or cause accidents Can you take responsibility? Who will be able to take responsibility?

He's a good man and has a Mercedes Don't overthink. Just marry him I just want you to say something to me I wish you happy! My memories of Xiao Mann started vividly that summer I was holding her in my arms like holding a fantasy I think If our fingers touched there would be lighting If we spat, a rainbow flower would grow out of the dirt If we made love in a wild field She would be carrying a saint But in front of fantasy men should never take off their pants Never What's inside a body? Aorta Adrenal glands Stealing things from the anatomy lab again? It's for self-defense Who's going to attack you?

You dominate every thing of me, from eating to sleeping Do you think you can control me because of sex? You're an idiot. Asshole!

I hope you study hard and become a good doctor Sometimes I feel you love me but sometimes not I want to hug you Got a condom? None left Absolutely not Your brain functions like this: parts of the brain, like the cingulate cortex, in charge of emotion and the insula are activated Then your temperature sense of hunger and sleepy hypothalamus become active Nucleus accumbens, in charge of joy and caudate nucleus, in charge of memory, are ready Is it fun being so analytical? Using my brain as a specimen? Donate my organs first Where's my underwear? Qiu Shui Feeling better? Better, I'm taking care of him Why didn't you go to class?

Sit down Sit down Don't drink so fast Sip it slowly I'm thirsty You're flushed Am I? - Do you have a girlfriend? - Yes Tell me about her Let me tell you about my first love I was young and very shy For 3 years I was too scared to confess my feelings for her She didn't know until after the college entrance exam We were only together for a summer During that summer I would bicycle 2 miles to see her and talk to her after her parents went to work We would listen to her favorite Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" Was I naive? We received our admission letters She was admitted to a college far away from home A young official escorted her there She told me I was the last person she embraced that summer She left me the "Pathetique" cassette She said I could listen to it when I missed her I listened to it every day Every night I decided that in the future at my wedding or funeral I would use this symphony as background music I will tell everyone that if they don't use this music I won't go to the wedding and if they don't use this music I won't rest in peace Xiao Mann's getting married To her official? I think of him as being like the butt of his Mercedes To me that man's face is his Mercedes' butt What about you? Are you still with (that official)... We broke up I've been looking for a man who really loves me But I haven't found him When I was very little my parents divorced Life's hard for my mom She's been alone ever since Since they divorced I've made all my decisions by myself A girl always says that when she grows up the first boyfriend she meets must be like her father I think I could never love a man like my dad Absolutely not I'll stay and drink with you Qiu Shui Let's go What's the matter? Congratulate me! Why? My period... - What? - My period It started Screw the pregnancy test kit! Screw you Screw you You Why? Why the hell have you been treating me like that?

Wei Yan I'll do it myself Let me No Who's there? Who's there? In past years doing a gynecological examination did not include checking external genitals It's different now Female students and male students in a class treat male and female corpses the same way We should always love and be passionate about medical science It's true at school It's even true when you begin your career Stay hungry, keep exploring. Correct? Got it, Wei Yan? Professor Bai Where's the claustrum? Here Claustrum Between the external and outer-external capsules there is flat gray matter about 1-2 mm thick Not exactly French scientists' studies demonstrate that the claustrum activates the male sex impulse It controls man's sexual desire I understand this but it's still being studied and isn't completely proved The study and verification are in an early stage Right, Professor Bai, I want to ask you why someone can't control his claustrum Why can't someone control it? Professor Bai is teaching us about gynecology not male sexual impulses I think the ultimate goal of gynecology is to eliminate impetuosity Impetuosity is harmful Impetuosity is like the devil Did you break my window last night? Your window was broken? Why? What have you done for someone to break your window? Your claustrum is congested Your head is full of filth Your claustrum is fucking congested Once congested it will...

I finished work and she invited me for dinner - What's wrong with that? - I don't want to talk about this anymore Can you stop seeing her? Please It was just a dinner I'm asking you to stop Just a dinner! Enough! What else did you two do at dinner? Are you upset because I was rude to her? Quiet, I'm trying to sleep! Screw you! Our love is falling apart What have I done wrong? I can try to change Did you kiss her like that? Camera Because of you! My overreaction only shows there's something I don't want to face up to Bai Lu's distraught I'm sad too What making me upset is that I don't know who to blame and how to get out of this mess Qiu Shui, please leave I don't want you in my life anymore Go! Grandpa Hu Good boy - This is Qiu Shui - It's me - Xiao Mann - What's up? - Do you still want me? - Don't be fucking disillusioned It's you! I'm here to give her something Where's Liu Qing?

Count it - There's no need - Count it! - Don't friends trust each other? The other day... It's fine. Forget about it I'm fine. I mean it But if I didn't have to give you the translation I wouldn't have dared to see you Sorry about that I suddenly feel I hate myself I think I'm an asshole It's all my fault Do you agree? There are many dimensions to the world None is right or wrong Only true or false This is right What you feel here is real in your life Nothing else counts. Understand? You are so pessimistic Not completely That's why I'm divisive Let's get out of here Let me take you somewhere else I bet you've never seen this before - Is it real? - It is real After an artery's injected with liquid plastic and it solidifies everything else dissolves and this is what's left Pretty, isn't it? Why is it red? Like red coral, right? Sort of You're brave They once loved, hated, and had a first time to fall in love, fall out of love, become parents, and experience loss But now these people have ended up like this I've decided that I will donate my body when I die I want to do the same What are you doing? Why are you doing that? You're like Gargamel in the Smurfs Try this Alcohol's magic At that moment if she's a plant my eyes are water I will nourish her and illuminate her With my gaze But at that moment I'm so afraid she will disappear because my tears are icy and my embrace is cold This is paradise Sorry That man... Him Official Ma It's him Don't think that you and me have this... so you can judge me You know? I'm wondering if he owns a Mercedes with a sexy butt Why are you asking this? Why? Why? I just... I just wanted to ask... I just wanted to ask if he has... Yes!

Wait She was released before me She served just a year She wanted to see you before we turned ourselves in This summer you were the last person embraced They said we were killing not healing But I think They were just jealous we made money Did you see her that day? Yes Didn't she tell you this? Well, that makes sense She didn't want to tell you I still remember what she told me She said She's only fallen for one man in her life I've only fallen for one man in my life I want him to see all my beauty so that whenever he's not with me he will be restless It's indeed. I really don't want to hold him back I want him to have a better life and future But sometimes I have that dream that I really... I really don't care I just want to be with him I want to watch him far from a distance But a dream is a dream I have to wake up Mr. Lu do me a favor 19 years old She's a pretty female writer Her writing style's unique You know She has many fans on the internet Please criticize her as much as you possible Understood. A little division draws a lot of attention. Master Lu Great! Counting on you The book... Please take a good look Don't worry. See you later - Next time, my treat - Okay See you later Keep in touch. See you I always blame myself I shouldn't have done that I always regret I haven't held you back We love each other but part at last If we always hover outside the happiness Who can tell I encounter you again There is a reason for destiny to arrange us like this I've been living not bad these years I only know someone I need is not here I'm getting to know I'm still caring about you as always How much love that can start over How many people who're willing to wait I return after knowing how to cherish you but don't know if love still exists How much love that can start over How many people who deserve waiting When passions have already cooled down Do we still have courage to love Who can tell I encounter you again There is a reason for destiny to arrange us like this I've been living not bad these years I only know someone I need is not here I'm getting to know I'm still caring about you as always How much love that can start over How many people who're willing to wait I return after knowing how to cherish you but don't know if love still exists How much love that can start over How many people who deserve waiting When passions have already cooled down Do we still have courage to love
