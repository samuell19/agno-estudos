... [BARKS] [BARKS] COME ON, NERO. [BARKS] COME ON, BOY. CADDIE!! CADDIE WOODLAWN!! COME ON, NERO. COME ON. DO HURRY, CHILD. WE'LL BE LATE FOR UNCLE EDMUND. CADDIE, KEEP YOUR DRESS CLEAN. IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION. HOW COME TOM GETS TO GO? I'M THE OLDEST. GOOD FOR YOU, TOM WOODLAWN. BYE! STAY OUT OF THOSE COOKIES! UNCLE EDMUND KNOWS THE BEST TRICKS IN THE WHOLE WORLD. OH, NO. MOTHER'S FLOWERS FOR COUSIN ANNABELLE. SHE FORGOT THEM. COME ON, WARREN. WHOA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'VE GOT TO CATCH THE WAGON. BLACKIE THREW A SHOE. HE'S GETTING A NEW ONE NOW. CRANK THAT, WARREN. I'LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE BETSY. YOU KNOW BETSY DOESN'T LIKE RIDERS. SHE WOULDN'T TRY ANYTHING WITH ME. WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING. IT'S NOT SAFE WITH ALL THESE INDIANS. MOTHER WOULDN'T FORGIVE HERSELF FOR FORGETTING ANNABELLE'S BOUQUET. WE MUST MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION. LET'S GO, WARREN. BUT I WANT TO STAY WITH MR. IRETON. THANK YOU, MR. IRETON. BE GOOD NOW, BETSY. OH, NO, BETSY! NO! THANKS, BETSY. DON'T EXPECT EXTRA OATS FROM ME AGAIN EVER. DO YOU HEAR? [NEIGHS] [BARKS] [WHISTLE BLOWS] OH! EDMUND. IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU. MY BEAUTIFUL SISTER. JOHN. HI, EDMUND. TOM, YOU'VE GROWN A FOOT. WHAT DO YOU EAT? HELLO, CADDIE! IS THAT NERO? [NERO BARKS] COME ON, BOY. COME ON. GOOD BOY. GOOD BOY. UNCLE EDMUND! CADDIE, LOOK AT YOU. YOU FORGOT YOUR FLOWERS FOR COUSIN... COUSIN ANNABELLE. OH, DARLING AUNT HARRIET. WHAT A PERFECT PLEASURE. AND THIS MUST BE UNCLE JOHN... JUST AS I IMAGINED YOU. OH, AND THESE MUST BE MY DARLING COUSINS. OH, HOW ABSOLUTELY DIVINE! OH. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN. IT'S ALL YOURS? OF COURSE, COUSIN CAROLINE. CALL ME CADDIE. GLAD TO MEET YOU. THESE ARE FOR YOU. HOW THOUGHTFUL. I ABSOLUTELY ADORE FLOWERS. DON'T YOU? WON'T YOU CARRY THEM FOR ME? CADDIE, I BROUGHT SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOU. THANK YOU, UNCLE EDMUND. [SNAKE SQUEALS] IT'S FROM ENGLAND. BY GUM! IT WAS WORTH IT. [LAUGHTER] UNCLE EDMUND, REALLY. NERO, SHOW UNCLE EDMUND OUR NEW TRICK. COVER YOUR EYES. HA HA. GOOD BOY. UP, UP. SHAKE. HE'LL DO FINE. JOHN, HOW'S THE SQUIRREL-HUNTING? DON'T DO MUCH OF THAT. FATHER SAYS INDIANS ONLY HUNT FOR FOOD. THAT SHOULD BE A LESSON. HE SAYS SPORT HUNTING IS FOR FOOLS PASTTIME. CADDIE, COME HERE. ANNABELLE IS BRIMMING WITH NEWS FROM BOSTON. I WORE THIS DRESS, AND WE GOT TO BED AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING. YOU DESCRIBE IT PERFECTLY. HOW IS GRANDMOTHER GREY? WELL-- MOTHER, I HAVE A BIG ACHE. ANYONE WHO GOBBLES 16 COOKIES IN ONE AFTERNOON WON'T GET SYMPATHY FROM ME. SIT WITH YOUR UNCLE EDMUND. FOR HER 96th BIRTHDAY, MOTHER AND FATHER HELD A SOIREE. IT WAS DIVINE. YOUR BOSTON DOES SOUND A BIT LIKE HEAVEN. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST ABSOLUTELY DIVINE CITIES, CAROLINE-- THE ONLY PLACE THAT I COULD BEAR TO LIVE. DUNNVILLE'S PRETTY NICE. DUNNVILLE? OH, IT ISN'T EVEN ON THE MAPS. HOW CAN THAT BE? WE ALL LIVE HERE. ♪ DID YOU EVER SEE A LASSIE ♪ ♪ GO THIS WAY AND THAT WAY ♪ ♪ AND THIS WAY AND THAT WAY ♪ ♪ AND THIS WAY AND THAT? ♪ ♪ DID YOU ♪ ♪ EVER SEE A LASSIE ♪ ♪ GO THIS WAY AND THAT WAY... ♪ SHE'S NEARLY 12 YEARS OLD YET BARELY KNOWS HOW TO BOIL WATER. BUT LIFE'S A TREASURE HUNT FOR CADDIE. SHE'S DISCOVERING NEW THINGS EVERY DAY. DON'T WORRY. THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF TIME FOR BOILING WATER. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO LEARN, JOHN... COOKING, SEWING, HOUSEKEEPING. DID YOU SEE ANNABELLE'S LOVELY MANNERS? I HOPE CADDIE CAN LEARN SOMETHING FROM HER. I SO WANT HER TO UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL GRACES. IS THAT REALLY IMPORTANT? THIS IS DUNNVILLE, NOT BOSTON. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT, NO MATTER WHERE ONE IS. CADDIE WILL BE A WIFE AND MOTHER SOON. CADDIE WILL LEARN WHEN SHE'S READY. SHE'LL BE A LADY. I WANT HER TO SPEND HER SUMMER WITH ANNABELLE. COUSIN CAROLINE? WHAT? SINCE I APPEAR FATED TO WASTE MY ENTIRE SUMMER HERE, I WAS THINKING HOW MUCH I'D LIKE TO LEARN THE WAYS OF THE WILD WEST. CAROLINE, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TEACH ME ALL ABOUT YOUR FARM. YOU WOULD? OH, YES. WHEN I TELL MY FRIENDS, THEY WILL BE OVERCOME WITH THE AMUSEMENT OF IT ALL. I'M SURE THEY WILL. I WILL PUT MY WHOLE MIND TO IT, COUSIN ANNABELLE. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. I'M GOING INTO TOWN FOR THE DAY. CADDIE, SHOW ANNABELLE AROUND THE FARM. SHE'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS IN A MOMENT. YES, MA. I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME EVERYTHING IN YOUR SAVAGE COUNTRY. I WANT TO RIDE HORSEBACK, AND I WANT TO FEED THOSE ADORABLE LITTLE SHEEP... AND EVERYTHING ELSE. I AM YOURS FOR THE TEACHING, CAROLINE. WHAT IS THAT YOU'RE WEARING? WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE LATEST IN SPORTING COSTUMES. GRANDMOTHER GREY INSISTS THAT I AM WELL TURNED OUT. HOW DO YOU MANAGE WITHOUT A DRESSING TABLE UPSTAIRS? WELL, IT'S HARD, BUT WE MAKE DO SOMEHOW. DON'T WE, CADDIE? WHY DO YOU NEED ALL THESE BUTTONS? ALL THE BOSTON GIRLS ARE WEARING THEM. IT'S THE LATEST DECORATION. NOBODY HAS AS MANY AS I-- 8 AND 80-- NOT EVEN BESSY BEASLEY HAS THAT MANY AND SHE'S ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED TO SOCIETY. ONE, TWO, THREE... DO YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH US WEARING THAT? WHY NOT? I AM PERFECTLY PREPARED TO BE AS UNCIVILIZED AS YOU. I JUST HAPPEN TO BE NICELY DRESSED. ...57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65... NOT BETSY! BE QUIET! YOU KNOW ABOUT BETSY. SHH! GIDDY-UP. I LOVE IT. I LOVE RIDING. I KNEW I SHOULD BE GOOD AT THIS. LOOK AT ME! TOUCH HER WITH YOUR HEELS. UH-OH! THERE SHE GOES! HOW DO YOU MAKE IT TURN AROUND? AAH! AAH! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'D MUCH PREFER TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE NOW. LET'S... LET'S FEED SHEEP. [BLEATING] THEY LOOK EXACTLY LIKE GUESTS AT A RECITAL. BETTER PUT THE BASKET DOWN, ANNABELLE. SHEEP LIKE OATS A LOT. I WANT THOSE ADORABLE LAMBS EATING RIGHT OUT OF MY HAND. [GIGGLING] THEY'RE--THEY'RE-- THEY'RE EATING MY BUTTONS. HA HA! THEY'RE EATING MY BUTTONS. ANNABElLE'S GOING TO TELL ON US, AS SURE AS SHOOTING. WE'RE DEAD PETUNIAS. I HEARD YOU CHILDREN HAD QUITE A DAY. HA HA. IT WAS AN UNBELIEVABLY QUAINT EXPERIENCE. THEY'LL HARDLY BELIEVE IT WHEN I TELL THEM IN BOSTON. I'M GLAD YOU ARE GETTING ALONG. SUPPER'S READY. GET YOUR FATHER AND UNCLE EDMUND. BUT THEN, MY FRIENDS IN BOSTON CAN HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND THE UTTER CRUDENESS OF FRONTIER LIFE. TAKE IT FROM ME, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE SMALL-GAME HUNTING TESTS A GENTLEMAN'S MARKSMANSHIP. WHO WANTS TO HELP? ME! ME! WHO'S THE BEST BUSHWHACKER HERE? YOU LET THAT SQUIRREL ESCAPE. I DIDN'T HAVE A GUN. WHO HAS AN EAGLE EYE TO SPOT THE CRITTERS? ME! BUT YOU'RE THE LITTLE CHATTERBOX. BESIDES, YOU EAT TOO MUCH. I WOULDN'T EAT. I WOULDN'T TALK. HONEST, I WOULDN'T TALK, JUST... HA HA HA. WARREN, YOU'RE FAR TOO YOUNG. I WOULD BE THE BEST PAIR OF EYES. THAT COULD BE, CADDIE, BUT LOOK HERE. YOU'RE A GIRL. THAT'S NOT FAIR. I SUPPOSE IT ISN'T. WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN. COULD I, PLEASE? OH, CADDIE. WOULDN'T YOU RATHER HELP ANNABELLE? SHE HAS LOVELY IDEAS ABOUT WHAT TO DO TO ARRANGE YOUR HAIR. WITHOUT CADDIE, I MIGHT SHOOT THE COW BY MISTAKE. HA HA! SQUIRRELS DON'T LOOK LIKE COWS. THEY DON'T? HA HA! PLEASE, MOTHER. UNCLE EDMUND CAN'T SEE HIS NOSE. WELL, THAT IS WHAT FATHER SAID. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD BUY SOME SPECTACLES. THEN YOU CAN TELL COWS FROM SQUIRRELS. OH, NO, AUNTY HARRIET. GRANDMA GREY SAYS A TRUE GENTLEMAN WOULD NEVER WEAR THEM. OH, LET HER GO, HARRIET. YOU CAN CATCH UP ON ANNABELLE'S NEWS. WELL, ALL RIGHT. LATER I EXPECT YOU TO SPEND YOUR TIME WITH ANNABELLE. HA HA HA. [THUD] THESE QUARTERS ARE REALLY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. [GROWLS] DOWN, NERO. HA HA. AAH! SOMETHING TRIED TO BITE ME. IT'S A WILD ANIMAL. THEY'RE JUST PORCUPINES, COUSIN ANNABELLE. PORCUPINE! HA HA. HA HA. COUSIN WARREN, WHAT A CHILDISH TRICK. HA HA. HA HA. I SHALL NOT SLEEP A WINK IN THIS FORSAKEN WILDERNESS. I KNOW IT. SWEET DREAMS, COUSIN ANNABELLE. GOOD NIGHT. [BARKS] HEEL, NERO. HEEL! NERO! CONFOUND THAT DOG! NERO! HAVEN'T YOU TAUGHT HIM ANYTHING? HE'LL CHASE OFF THE GAME WITH HIS SHENANIGANS. WHAT IS THIS CONTRAPTION? IT'S AN INDIAN CANOE THAT FATHER TOOK IN TRADE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? IT'S NOT STABLE. I'LL PUT MY FAITH IN THAT RAFT. I'LL BEAT YOU TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER. WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. GOOD BOY, NERO. AHH. OK. GOOD BOY. THERE WE GO. LOOK AT ME! I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU, CADDIE. YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE! I'VE GOT YOU NOW! WHAT'S GOING ON? I'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE, UNCLE EDMUND. I'LL BEAT YOU! I'LL GET YOU IN THE STRETCH! I'M ON MY WAY! GOOD BOY, NERO. STAY. WE'RE COMING THROUGH! COMING THROUGH! THAT'S IT. STAY THERE, NERO. GOOD BOY. ARGH. WHOOP! WHOOP! OHH! HA HA HA! HA HA HA! IT'S COLD! GOOD BOY, NERO! IT'S OK! GOOD BOY! HA HA HA! UNCLE EDMUND! CONFOUND IT. GOOD BOY. IT'S OK. GOOD BOY. WE'LL GET IT ON THE WAY BACK. HA HA HA! WHAT IS IT? THE DAKOTAS' NEW HUNTING CAMP. THEY MOVED BACK ACROSS THE RIVER. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. I'D LIKE TO KEEP MY SCALP FIRMLY ON MY HEAD. DOWN, NERO, YOU SILLY THING. NERO, GET DOWN. GET DOWN! GET DOWN! YOU SHOULD PUT HIM OUTSIDE. OH, NEVER MIND. I DID WANT TO DISCUSS NERO WITH YOU, HARRIET. I APPRECIATE YOUR LOOKING AFTER HIM. THE COUNTRY IS A BETTER PLACE TO RAISE A DOG THAN THE CITY. HE'S BECOME FAMILY. IT GIVES ME SATISFACTION TO KNOW HE'S WITH THE CHILDREN. I THOUGHT HE'D HAVE BEEN TRAINED DIFFERENTLY, THE SORT OF THING HE DESERVES. I'D LIKE TO TAKE NERO BACK WITH ME. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN, ESPECIALLY CADDIE? JOHN. HE'S YOUR DOG, EDMUND. DO AS YOU SEE FIT. I'LL BRING HIM BACK THIS FALL. YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE NERO? OH, EDMUND. HE'S SUCH A RESPONSIBILITY. LOOK AFTER HIM, WON'T YOU? DON'T GIVE IT ANOTHER THOUGHT. NERO WILL BE FINE AND DANDY WITH ME. YOU CAN'T TAKE NERO. TOM. EDMUND. JOHN. BYE, CADDIE. GOOD-BYE, NERO. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TAUGHT YOU BAD HABITS. I'LL THINK ABOUT YOU EVERY DAY. I'LL WAIT FOR YOU. YOU'RE THE BEST DOG IN THE WORLD. ALL ABOARD! COME ON, NERO. HEEL! [CLUCKING] NOTHING'S ANY FUN ANYMORE WITHOUT NERO. WHY IS EVERYBODY MOPING ABOUT A DOG? BOSTON LADIES FIND ANGORA CATS TO BE DIVINE. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING, DO YOU? I WAS COMING TO SAY GOOD NIGHT. DOES SHE REALLY HAVE TO STAY THE WHOLE SUMMER? THAT'S THE PLAN. THAT'S SURE A LONG TIME. YOU'LL MAKE IT. MOTHER LIKES ANNABELLE A LOT, DOESN'T SHE? SHE THINKS ANNABELLE'S A FINE YOUNG LADY. WHAT DO YOU THINK? THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SHE'LL FIT INTO BOSTON SOCIETY, BUT, CADDIE, I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HARM TO MAKE HER FEEL WELCOME. SHE'S MOTHER'S GUEST, NOT MINE. CADDIE. I WISH COUSIN ANNABELLE WOULD HIGHTAIL IT BACK TO BOSTON AS FAST AS THOSE LITTLE BOOTS CAN CARRY HER. I CAN'T DO IT, FATHER! I CAN'T BE LIKE HER. HERE YOU ARE. I WAS AFRAID YOU'D BEEN CARRIED OFF BY SAVAGES. I KNEW THAT WARREN COULD FIND YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? TURNING SOMERSAULTS. HARDLY SOMETHING A PROPER YOUNG LADY WOULD DO. I'D NEVER DO IT AT HOME. SINCE THERE'S NOBODY IMPORTANT HERE, I'LL JOIN IN. SHOW ME HOW. OH. I DARE YOU TO DO THAT MANY. JUST WATCH ME. MY WALTZING INSTRUCTOR SAYS I HAVE THE FINEST SENSE OF BALANCE HE'S EVER SEEN. OH! THIS IS ACTUALLY RATHER FUN! I CAN DO TWICE AS MANY AS YOU. OH, BY THE WAY... KEEP YOUR FEET TOGETHER. IT LOOKS NICER. AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! THERE'S SOMETHING SQUISHY! HA HA! YOU DID IT! YOU'RE HORRID. I DIDN'T MIND THE STUPID PORCUPINES OR FALLING OFF THE HORSE OR BEING ATTACKED BY SHEEP, BUT THIS-- THIS IS SQUISHY. AN EGG? WHATEVER POSSESSED YOU TO DO A THING LIKE THAT? IT WAS ONLY A JOKE, MOTHER. YOU SCARED HER INTO A TIZZY. IS THAT A JOKE? IT'S MY FAULT, TOO. YOUR FATHER WILL DEAL WITH YOU. SHAME ON BOTH OF YOU FOR BEING MEAN. CAROLINE, GO TO YOUR ROOM. STAY THERE UNTIL I TELL YOU TO COME OUT. FORGET ABOUT SUPPER. I DON'T WANT TO TALK. I DID NOT INTEND TO BE MEAN. I JUST WANTED TO HAVE SOME FUN. YOU FIND IT FUN TO TEASE OTHERS? I JUST DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT, I SUPPOSE. SO YOU LEARNED SOMETHING TODAY. THINK BEFORE YOU ACT, ESPECIALLY IF IT MIGHT HURT SOMEBODY. I PROMISE. YOU SHOULD MAKE IT UP WITH ANNABELLE. HOW? BE A LITTLE NICER TO HER. I'LL TRY. DOES SHE BOTHER YOU THAT MUCH, CADDIE? MOTHER LIKES ANNABELLE BETTER THAN ME, DOESN'T SHE? THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOUR MOTHER LOVES YOU AND THE BOYS MORE THAN ANYTHING. IF MOTHER DOESN'T LIKE ANNABELLE BETTER THAN ME, WHY DOES SHE WANT ME TO BE LIKE HER? I CAN'T PRETEND TO ALWAYS BE SO POLITE. I JUST CAN'T BE ANOTHER ANNABELLE. WELL, ONE ANNABELLE'S PROBABLY ENOUGH AROUND THIS HOUSE. WHAT DOES MOTHER WANT ME TO BE? UNDERSTANDING OF OTHER PEOPLE... WISE, RESPONSIBLE. ISN'T THAT WHAT GOOD MANNERS REALLY ARE? YOUR MOTHER WORRIES ABOUT YOU. SHE WANTS YOU TO BE READY TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND LOOK AFTER A FAMILY OF YOUR OWN, SOMEDAY. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO BE? OH, SWEETHEART, I WANT YOU TO BE YOU, THE REAL CADDIE THAT'S DEEP DOWN INSIDE. FATHER. AHH. [PLAYING AMAZING GRACE ON PIANO] AH, MRS. WOODLAWN. MR. WOODLAWN, CADDIE, THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING. REVEREND, THANK YOU. THANKS AGAIN FOR ANOTHER FINE SERVICE. ALWAYS A PLEASURE. YOU CAN RAISE THE RAFTERS WITH THEM SERMONS. PUT MORE THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD THAN A HANDSOME WOMAN. HOPEFULLY, MY WORDS WILL INSPIRE EVERYBODY. ABOUT THEM INDIANS-- YOU REALLY FIGURE THEY'RE GETTING READY FOR WARRING? THOSE INDIANS ARE ON THE WARPATH AGAIN. I HOPE NOT, MR. SKEEL. YOU HAVE AN EYE FOR TROUBLE, SAM HANKINSON. KEEP OUT OF THIS. LOOK AFTER BUSINESS AT HOME. THANKS FOR THE ADVICE, REVEREND. HI, PETE. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK THERE, OLAF? OH, NOTHING. THAT SHIPMENT OF SUPPLIES FOR THE SAWMILL COME IN YESTERDAY. ONE OF MY MEN... ELLA MAE PLAYED THE PIANO BEAUTIFULLY TODAY. NICE TO SEE HER UP AND AROUND. I'LL TRY AND GET HER MUSIC LESSONS. SHE HAS A GIFT. YOU MUST BE PROUD. SHE TAKES AFTER HER FATHER, REST HIS SOUL. THOSE NEW FABRICS ARE COMING IN. WE COULD FIT THE CHILDREN FOR SCHOOL. I'LL PLAN ON THAT, MAYBELLINE. MOTHER. SAM HANKINSON LEAVES HIS BOYS OUTSIDE WHILE HE'S IN CHURCH. WHY? IT'S A SHAME FOR THE BOYS, BUT THERE ARE RULES. WHAT KIND OF RULES? IT'S COMPLICATED, CADDIE. THEIR MOTHER WAS AN INDIAN. SHE WAS? SAM MARRIED THEIR MOTHER WHEN THERE WERE FEW SETTLERS HERE. NOBODY CARED. WOULD FATHER BE ASHAMED OF US IF YOU WERE AN INDIAN? HOW CAN I ANSWER THAT, CADDIE? WOULD HE LEAVE US OUTSIDE DURING CHURCH? OF COURSE NOT. TOM, MRS. HYMAN'S HERE TO DO OUR SCHOOL CLOTHES. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NOTHING. YOU'RE COMBING YOUR HAIR. SO? AND YOU'RE WEARING YOUR SUNDAY SHIRT. EXCUSE ME. I'LL POKE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DON'T STAND STILL. OW! I SAID IT WAS SURE HAPPEN. HE'S GROWING LIKE A WEED. MAKE A HOOP SKIRT FOR CAROLINE. IT WOULD BE DARLING. I DO NOT LIKE HOOP SKIRTS. WHEN I SIT DOWN, THEY HIT ME IN THE NOSE. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO WEAR THEM. I LOVE HOOP SKIRTS. IT'S NICE TO SEE THE ROSES BACK IN ELLA MAE'S CHEEKS. THE DOCTOR'S COMING AROUND TO CHECK HER. I LIKE THIS COLOR. IT'S FOR YOU. OH. A LETTER FROM UNCLE EDMUND. MOTHER? OH. TOM... GO GATHER EVERYBODY INTO THE PARLOR. UNCLE EDMUND'S LETTER IS ABOUT NERO. HE WRITES THAT NERO HAS RUN AWAY. EDMUND HAS SCOURED ST. LOUIS LOOKING FOR HIM. NERO WAS LOST? "BUT SAY, "WHEN I COME IN THE FALL, I INTEND TO BRING A PUPPY TO TAKE HIS PLACE." A PUPPY? OH, YOU'LL LOVE A PUPPY, CAROLINE. WHAT PUPPY COULD TAKE THE PLACE OF NERO? OH, CADDIE! I'M SO SORRY. UNCLE EDMUND IS SO CARELESS! I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LET HIM TAKE HIM. [SOBBING] LOOK! NERO! ARE YOU SURE? IT'S HIM! I SAW HIM! WHY DOESN'T HE COME? MAYBE HE'S HURT. HE'S GOING INTO THE MARSH! MA WILL TAN OUR HIDES IF SHE LEARNS WE WENT INTO THE MARSH. WE CAN'T SWIM! WE'VE GOT TO SAVE NERO! HE'S HEADED FOR THE INDIAN CAMP! THEY MIGHT MAKE STEW OUT OF HIM! I HATE DRESSES! HOLD ON TIGHT, WARREN. YEAH. DON'T LET GO. WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS. WHAT ABOUT QUICK MIRES? YOU MEAN QUAGMIRES. OR QUICKSAND. WHAT ABOUT THEM? WHAT'S THE MATTER? ARE YOU AFRAID? DON'T BE A 'SCAREDY CAT', WARREN. MY DRESS! YOU'RE IN TROUBLE NOW! WE'RE GLAD YOU COULD COME FOR DINNER, REVEREND. I MUST APOLOGIZE. THE CHILDREN ARE USUALLY SO GOOD ABOUT MEALTIMES. NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE, MRS. WOODLAWN. YOU MAY AS WELL SAY GRACE, REVEREND. AS WE GATHER HERE AMONG OUR BELOVED FRIENDS AND FAMILY, WE COUNT OUR BLESSINGS. [HORSE WHINNIES] THAT'S NOT NERO. I WAS SURE. WHAT IF THEY CATCH US? THEY'LL HAVE THREE NEW SCALPS FOR THEIR COLLECTION. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WE'RE HERE. YOU LEAVE MY BROTHERS ALONE! KEHTANA! KEHTANA! LET ME GO! [SPEAKING INDIAN LANGUAGE] YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET SCALPED? I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING I EVER SAID TO YOU. ME, TOO. YOU ARE ON DAKOTA LAND. WHO ARE YOU? CAROLINE AUGUSTA WOODLAWN, SIR. THESE ARE MY BROTHERS, TOM AND WARREN. WE COME IN PEACE. YOU ARE THE CHILD OF JOHN WOODLAWN? YES. WE'D LIKE TO GO HOME NOW. YOU HAVE HAIR LIKE FIRE. I AM TUKENBHESKA, CHIEF OF THE DAKOTA. PLEASE, DO NOT HURT US, CHIEF. FEAR IS YOUR ONLY ENEMY, CAROLINE AUGUSTA WOODLAWN, AS FEAR BECOMES THE ENEMY OF MY PEOPLE. WE NEED NOT FEAR CHILDREN. HMM. HOW ARE THINGS AT THE MILL? IT'S A YEAR-ROUND OPERATION, REVEREND. WE'VE KEPT THE MEN WORKING THIS SUMMER. THE GOOD LORD HAS BESTOWED HIS GRACE. CADDIE. CAROLINE AUGUSTA WOODLAWN. GOOD EVENING, REVEREND TANNER. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THESE HAZELNUTS ARE FOR YOU, MOTHER. I'M SORRY. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? AN INDIAN CAMP. I SAW CHIEF TUKENBHESKA. YOU SAW TUKENBHESKA? YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE, GIRL. AND YOUR BROTHERS? TOM! AND WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES? WELL, I SORT OF LOST THEM... CROSSING THE MARSH. THE MARSH? THE CHIEF GAVE ME THIS SKIRT AND THIS VEST. I FEEL LIKE AN INDIAN. NOT IN THIS HOUSE, YOUNG LADY. GET WASHED. GET IN A DRESS IMMEDIATELY. REVEREND, I'M SO SORRY. I HOPE YOU WILL NOT CONSIDER THIS A REFLECTION ON THE BOSTON FAMILY. IT SEEMS YOUNG ANNABELLE WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT TUTOR IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO MAKE A LADY OUT OF CAROLINE. WOULDN'T YOU AGREE? I AGREE COMPLETELY. YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK WITH MY HUSBAND ABOUT THAT. YES, PERHAPS IT IS MY FAULT, REVEREND. I LET CADDIE RUN WITH THE BOYS INSTEAD OF STAYING IN THE HOUSE, BAKING BREAD, DIPPING CANDLES. PERHAPS YOU REMEMBER HOW FRAIL CADDIE WAS WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE FROM BOSTON, EVEN PALER AND THINNER THAN HER POOR SISTER. WHEN WE LOST LITTLE MARY SO SUDDENLY, I DECIDED CADDIE SHOULD BE OUT IN THE FRESH AIR. I'D RATHER SHE LEARN STRENGTH OF CHARACTER AND INDEPENDENCE. NOW SHE IS SO HEALTHY AND FIT-- MAYBE A LITTLE HEADSTRONG-- BUT SHE IS HAPPY... ENJOYING HER LIFE. [HARRIET] WARREN... ONE MOUTHFUL AT A TIME. LITTLE CROW HAS STAGED BRUTAL ATTACKS ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. HE SAYS HOMESTEADERS ARE MOVING ON HIS LANDS. ARE THEY? YES, UNFORTUNATELY. TROUBLE'S EVEN CLOSER. THE McCLARENS IN THE NEXT COUNTY HAD THEIR BARN BURNED. FOLKS UP NORTH GOT KILLED. THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. EVERY TOWN I VISIT IN WISCONSIN IS NERVOUS. IF SETTLERS HERE STAYED OFF DAKOTA GROUNDS THERE WON'T BE TROUBLE. INDIANS ARE THE ROOT OF IT-- SPREADING FEAR AND DREAD. CHIEF TUKENBHESKA SAID-- YOUNG LADIES LISTEN. THEY DON'T SPEAK UNLESS THEY'RE SPOKEN TO. THE CHIEF SAID FEAR IS OUR ONLY ENEMY. CADDIE! ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, WE SHOULD STAY CLEAR OF THEM. LET THOSE SAVAGES TEND TO THEIR OWN BUSINESS. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF OURS. [OWL HOOTING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] JOHN WOODLAWN. CHIEF TUKENBHESKA. [HORSE NEIGHS] THERE'S ANOTHER JUST LIKE HIM OUT THERE. IT'S ALL RIGHT. PUT YOUR GUN AWAY. I'LL BE OUTSIDE KEEPING AN EYE ON THINGS. HMM. UM. GIRLS, GO ON UP TO BED NOW. PLEASE. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. I'M HONORED BY YOUR VISIT. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? WHEN SETTLERS COME... THEY TAKE DAKOTA LAND. THEY HUNT OUR GAME. NOW WE MUST TRAVEL FAR FOR FOOD. OUR GUNS ARE OLD. NOT GOOD. THE SPRING LOCK IS BROKEN ON THIS MUSKET, CHIEF. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S EVEN SAFE TO FIRE THIS GUN. IT'S ALL RIGHT. MY CHILD WAS TAKEN IN THE MOON OF THE WHITE EARTH. WE HAD NO FOOD. SHE DIED FROM STARVATION? MM-HMM. [SPEAKS INDIAN LANGUAGE] MY HEART IS ON THE GROUND. SOON MANY MORE DAKOTA WILL ANSWER THE CALL OF THE GREAT SPIRIT AND FOLLOW MY DAUGHTER... UNLESS WE HAVE BETTER GUNS. YOU WANT ME TO FIX YOUR GUNS. THE SIOUX UP NORTH ARE ON THE WARPATH. SETTLERS ARE AFRAID THAT THE DAKOTAS MIGHT ATTACK THEIR HOMESTEADS HERE. PEACE-- [SPEAKS INDIAN LANGUAGE]-- IS MY WISH. BUT ONE OF MY BRAVES, KEHTANA-- HE HAS FEAR. HE SAYS TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH WHITE SETTLERS IS TO DIE. DO MANY OF YOUR PEOPLE AGREE? DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD FOLLOW KEHTANA? I AM CHIEF OF DAKOTA. THERE WILL BE NO WAR. [SPEAKS INDIAN LANGUAGE] IT IS MY WORD. I'M SURE HE MEANS IT, FATHER. THANK YOU. HARRIET, PLEASE ASK IRETON TO GET A DOZEN TURKEYS FOR THE CHIEF TO TAKE WITH HIM. IT ISN'T MUCH, BUT IT'LL HELP NOW-- AND A COUPLE OF BUSHELS OF POTATOES. NOW... I'LL TAKE A BETTER LOOK AT THIS GUN. ARE THEY ALL AS BAD AS THIS? BRING YOUR GUNS TO ME. I WILL TRY TO FIX THEM. I CAN'T TURN THEM INTO CARBINES, BUT THEY'LL BE MORE DEPENDABLE THAN THIS. HMM. WHOA. WHOA. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. COME. CADDIE. MORNING, MR. TORGORSON. MORNING, OSKAR. JOHN. ROBERT. HOW ABOUT A COOKIE, CADDIE? STOP THAT, OLAF, OR I'LL FLATTEN YOU. JUST TRY, WHY DON'T YOU? OLAF, BACK TO YOUR CHORES. AND STOP BOTHERING PEOPLE. BOY, IF I HAD A SILVER DOLLAR, I'D SURE KNOW HOW TO SPEND IT. HEY, HOW ABOUT THAT? OH, MY. YOU WANT TO SEE THE MUSIC BOX? YES. [MUSIC PLAYS] HOW DOES IT WORK? IT HAS MANY GEARS INSIDE. IS VERY COMPLICATED. OLAF, HAVEN'T YOU FINISHED FILLING THOSE BINS? BUT, FATHER... I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER EXCUSE! I BET ANY GIRL WOULD LIKE THIS. SURE WOULD, BUT I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND. I WANT TO BE SURE. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO SPEND THAT DOLLAR. HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? [CADDIE] IT'S ONE OF THE HANKINSONS. WHY CAN'T HE STAY? [BELL CLANGING] OH, HOW EXCITING. THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL IN THE WILD WEST. WHY DO YOU GO IN SUMMER? MISS PARKER TEACHES IN DURAND IN THE SPRING. THERE'S ONLY ONE TEACHER? HOW MANY DO YOU NEED? HOW CAN ONE PERSON KNOW EVERYTHING THERE IS TO LEARN? THAT'S TRUE. FOR ONCE YOU'RE RIGHT, COUSIN ANNABELLE. CADDIE. TOM. LITTLE WARREN, YOU'LL BE WITH US THIS YEAR. AND THIS IS? THIS IS MY COUSIN, ANNABELLE, FROM BOSTON SHE WANTS TO SEE OUR QUAINT LITTLE SCHOOL. I SHALL BE STARTING FINISHING SCHOOL IN BOSTON. WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE YOU HERE, MISS GREY. DO COME IN. OH. ONLY ONE ROOM? OH, HOW ABSOLUTELY PRIMITIVE. WHERE SHALL WE SIT? I SIT WITH MY FRIENDS. YOU CAN SIT ANYWHERE YOU WANT. WHAT? NO APPLE FOR THE TEACHER, CADDIE? HI, PETE. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE SITTING, INJUN? GET OUT OF MY SEAT. I SPOKE FOR IT. YOU BETTER GET BACK THERE WHERE YOU WON'T WRECK MY VIEW. NOW! YOU, TOO. OLAF TORGORSON, HOW DARE YOU? AHEM. [ANNABELLE] HELLO. I'M ANNABELLE GREY FROM BOSTON. MOST PLEASED TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE, I'M SURE. HA HA. GIVE ME BACK MY CHAPEAU. YOUR WHAT? HER HAT, OLAF TORGORSON. GIVE IT BACK. GIVE IT BACK. GIVE IT BACK! MISS PARKER! CADDIE, YOU'RE STRONGER THAN THAT. LET HER GO. WHO ASKED YOU, HALF-BREED? [MISS PARKER] OLAF TORGORSON! CAROLINE WOODLAWN! SHE STARTED IT. SHE HIT ME. HE TOOK ANNABELLE'S HAT. I'M GLAD I SMACKED HIM. I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO GIRLS, NOT EVEN YOU! OH! OLAF TORGORSON, THAT IS ENOUGH. NOW I'LL SHOW YOU WHO'S IN CHARGE. IN THE WOODSHED! AS FOR YOU, CAROLINE WOODLAWN, YOUR MOTHER WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS. "SHE AND OLAF TORGORSON "HAD A SCUFFLE. "WE MUST ATTEND TO THIS. MISS PARKER." BEING A RUFFIAN AT SCHOOL? I'M ASHAMED OF YOU. HE STARTED IT. OLAF TOOK MY HAT. IT WAS RATHER HEROIC. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR SCRAPPING. A YOUNG LADY NEVER RESORTS TO FIGHTING. EVEN WHEN SOMEONE'S DOING WHAT THEY SHOULDN'T? UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. NOW PUT THIS ON. ANNABELLE WILL TEACH YOU TO ROLL OUT DOUGH. I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON YOU HERE. IT'S QUITE SIMPLE, REALLY. I GOT YOU IN TROUBLE, DIDN'T I? NEVER MIND. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. MY WORD. YOU STOOD UP TO THAT BULLY. WHEN I'M FEELING LOW, I GO OUT AND BUY MYSELF SOMETHING NICE. MAYBE A NEW HAT. I DON'T WANT A NEW HAT, BUT MAYBE I WILL BUY MYSELF SOMETHING. TAKE COVER! GET DOWN! WHAT IS IT, ROBERT? INDIANS-- HUNDREDS OF THEM. WHAT'S GOING ON? [CADDIE] FATHER'S OUT THERE. GOOD HEAVENS! ROBERT, PUT THAT THING AWAY. STAY THERE, CADDIE! LET ME GO! LET HER GO, IRETON. [SPEAKS INDIAN LANGUAGE] JOHN WOODLAWN. [SPEAKS INDIAN LANGUAGE] KEHTANA. [SPEAKS INDIAN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKS INDIAN LANGUAGE] IT'LL TAKE ME A FEW DAYS. [SPEAKS INDIAN LANGUAGE] ROBERT, HELP ME GET THESE TO THE BARN. COULD JUST AS EASY HAVE BEEN A WAR PARTY. YOU KNEW I AGREED TO FIX THEIR GUNS. OSKAR? DO YOU HAVE TWO DOZEN MUSKET SPRING LOCKS? I'LL HAVE TO CHECK. NOT MUCH CALL FOR THEM. I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET THIS. I JUST FEEL IT IN MY BONES. THAT'S A LOT. YOU STARTING A WAR? I'M GIVING THEM TO THE DAKOTAS. YOU'RE WHAT? THEY'VE BARELY BEEN ABLE TO BAG ENOUGH GAME SURVIVE. IS THAT SO? I CAN'T LET YOU HAVE THOSE, JOHN, TO GIVE THEM TO SAVAGES. THE DAKOTAS ARE PEACEFUL. WE GIVE OUR NEIGHBORS HELP WHEN TIMES ARE HARD. THEY ARE SAVAGES. PUT THOSE BACK ON THE COUNTER. NO, OSKAR. PUT THESE ON MY ACCOUNT. GOOD DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU. COME ON, CADDIE. PETE, IT'S YOUR PA. HA HA. HA HA. I CAN'T SEE. [MISS PARKER] CHILDREN! CHILDREN! PA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M TAKING THE MULE! GET AWAY! WE HAVE BUSINESS OF OUR OWN, CHILDREN. HOW WILL WE GET TO SCHOOL? YOU HAVE FEET, WALK! PLEASE SIT DOWN. GRADE ONE, I'LL CHECK YOUR ALPHABET NEXT. GRADE TWO, YOU SHOULD FINISH YOUR ARITHMETIC. CAROLINE! WOULD YOU PLEASE BE SEATED? CAROLINE. HA HA. [STUDENT] HE'S CRYING. HA HA HA. HA HA HA. EYES ON YOUR WORK. NOW I SEEN EVERYTHING. I SEEN AN INJUN CRYING. THAT'S ENOUGH, OLAF. PETE? PETE. PA TOOK OUR MULE. [CLOCK CHIMES 3:00] CADDIE? HEAD BACK WITHOUT ME. I HAVE STUFF TO DO. AGAIN? SO? I'LL SEE YOU AT SUPPERTIME. HEY, PETE! ARE YOU WALKING HOME? YEAH. WHERE DID YOUR FATHER TAKE YOUR MULE? MINNESOTA OR SOMEPLACE. MY UNCLE TOOK MY DOG, NERO, TO ST. LOUIS. IT'S A LONG WALK TO SCHOOL. YOUR PA COMING BACK SOON? DEPENDS. HE JUST TOOK THEIR MULE TO MINNESOTA OR SOMEWHERE. WHO WATCHES AFTER THEM, MOTHER? THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE SHOES. EVERYBODY AT SCHOOL IS MEAN TO THEM. THEY EVEN LAUGHED AT THEM. THE MISFORTUNE OF OTHERS MAKES PEOPLE FEEL NERVOUS, AFRAID OF THINGS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. WATCH WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DEAR. THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF! THEY'RE ONLY LITTLE BOYS. WELL, SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF WHAT OTHERS MAY THINK. I'M NOT AFRAID. ARE YOU? CADDIE WOODLAWN... YOU CERTAINLY ARE YOUR FATHER'S DAUGHTER. NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. NEVER BE AFRAID TO BE KIND TO PEOPLE, NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE. IF ANYBODY CRITICIZES YOU, TURN THE OTHER CHEEK AND CARRY ON. AFTERNOON, CADDIE. HELLO. MIGHT TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT MUSIC BOX. [MUSIC PLAYING] OH, MY! CAN WE TAKE A LOOK INSIDE? WELL... LET'S SEE IF WE CAN OPEN IT. AH! ISN'T THAT SOMETHING? IT HAS GEARS JUST LIKE A CLOCK. SO IT DOES. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO DEAR. AS COSTLY AS ANYTHING IN THE STORE. EXCUSE ME, CADDIE. [I'M HERE TO PICK UP MY ORDER.] [CASH REGISTER RINGS] NOW, WHERE WERE WE? I'VE CHANGED MY MIND, MR. TORGORSON. I'D LIKE TO BUY THREE PAIR OF THESE BOOTS. I DON'T HAVE THREE IN YOUR SIZE. THEY'RE NOT FOR ME. WHAT SIZE WOULD SAM HANKINSON'S BOYS TAKE? YOU'RE BUYING SHOES FOR HALF-BREEDS? THEY NEED THEM. THESE SHOULD BE ABOUT RIGHT. SEE THAT THEY GET THEM. DON'T SAY ANYBODY BOUGHT THEM. SAY THEY'RE EXTRAS. TOM WOODLAWN! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I GOT A JOB. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? I DON'T KNOW. GOOD-BYE, MR. TORGORSON. I'D LIKE TO SEE THREE NAPKINS RETURNED. DO YOU EAT THEM OR SOMETHING? WE WERE CATCHING TOADS IN THEM. COME HOME AFTER SCHOOL. COUSIN ANNABELLE IS GOING TO SHOW US SOME NEEDLEPOINT. BOYS, TIME FOR SCHOOL! PUT YOUR LUNCH IN YOUR BAG. WARREN, NO RUNNING AROUND TODAY. SIT DOWN AND EAT. I TOLD YOU I WOULD. GOOD-BYE, MOTHER. GOOD-BYE. BYE, MOTHER. BYE. GOOD-BYE, MOTHER. GOOD-BYE. HEY! NEW SHOES. THINK THEY FOUND SOME MONEY? INJUN LOVER! I'M JUST GOING TO IGNORE YOU, OLAF TORGORSON. THERE WILL BE AN EXAM... BYE! BYE, CADDIE! DON'T WAIT FOR ME. I'LL CATCH UP. ELLA MAE? I HEARD IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY TOMORROW. YES. I'LL BE 14. I'VE NEVER GIVEN A BIRTHDAY PRESENT TO A GIRL BEFORE, EXCEPT CADDIE, BUT THAT DOESN'T COUNT. WELL, I HAD THIS HANGING AROUND, AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE IT. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAKE SURE IT'S WOUND. NOTHING HAPPENS IF IT'S NOT. TOM... THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I'VE EVER RECEIVED. I'LL TREASURE IT ALWAYS. THANK YOU. I'VE GOT TO GO NOW. MOTHER'S COME FOR ME. UM... PULL IT TIGHT, BUT NOT TOO TIGHT. COMME CA? OUI. CADDIE, COME AND SEE THIS LOVELY PETIT POINT THAT COUSIN ANNABELLE HAS SHOWN ME. I'LL TEACH YOU, TOO, CAROLINE. IT'S SO SIMPLE, DEAR. COME. JUST TRY. NO. OW! BETTER NOT TRY IT JUST NOW. I CAN DO IT, MOTHER. WHY DON'T I GO MAKE US SOME TEA? CADDIE, COME HERE. WHAT'S WRONG? TOM GAVE ELLA MAE A PRESENT. I KNOW. YOU KNOW? HE ASKED PERMISSION TO WORK IN MR. TORGORSON'S STORE TO BUY IT. WHY WOULD HE KEEP A SECRET LIKE THAT FROM ME? WELL, CADDIE, TOM IS GROWING UP. I THINK HE'S SWEET ON ELLA MAE. SHE'S NO FUN. SHE'S AFRAID OF SNAKES AND HORSES. SHE JUST ALWAYS PRACTICES HER MUSIC. SHE NEVER SAYS ANYTHING. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO JUDGE HARSHLY. ELLA MAE IS A LOVELY YOUNG LADY. YOUNG MEN LIKE THAT. YOU MEAN TOM? HE'S NOT A MAN. ANYHOW, I'M LOADS MORE FUN THAN HER. WHEN YOU GET OLDER, YOU'LL FIND SOMEBODY SPECIAL, TOO. MAY I GO NOW? YES, DEAR. CADDIE. IT WOULD LOOK RAVISHING. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. NO, THANK YOU. IF I WERE YOU, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT TOM AND ELLA MAE. MEN--THEY'RE ALL THE SAME. WHO CAN TELL WHAT THEY'RE UP TO? I'M DYING TO SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE IN SOMETHING PRETTY. YOU HAVE PERFECT POSTURE. I DO? I KNOW GIRLS WHO WOULD DIE TO HAVE SUCH REGAL BEARING. AND YOUR EYES, THEY ARE SENSATIONAL. THEY ARE? PUT THIS ON FOR A MOMENT. IT'LL FRAME YOUR FACE LIKE A HALO. YOU LOOK DIVINE. SEE WHAT I MEAN? OH, MY! HA HA! [LAUGHING] MMM. THE GUNS ARE GOOD. THANK YOU, JOHN WOODLAWN. THE EYE OF THE HAWK, CE-TAN, IS CLOSED. WHERE'S YOUR LITTLE DARLING, TOM? HA HA HA! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MISS PARKER? AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, ELLA MAE HAYMAN HAS BEEN QUITE ILL, UM, THESE LAST FEW MONTHS. I'M AFRAID THAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT ELLA MAE WON'T BE HERE WITH US ANYMORE. SHE PASSED AWAY LAST EVENING. ELLA MAE HAYMAN BROUGHT JOY INTO THE HEARTS OF ALL SHE KNEW. HER CHILDHOOD WAS LIKE A PIECE OF MUSIC. HER MEMORY WILL BE CAUGHT AS LIGHT IN A PRISM. NOW HER HYMNS RISE UP AND SWELL TO JOIN IN HARMONY WITH THE SPHERES, BUT THE MUSIC OF HER SHORT LIFE WILL NEVER FADE AWAY. MAY THE LORD TAKE THIS CHILD AND PROTECT HER IN HIS EVERLASTING GOODNESS. AMEN. I'M SO SORRY. TOM WOODLAWN. I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU. I-- I KNOW ELLA MAE WOULD WANT YOU TO KEEP THIS. SAM HANKINSON SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE UP THERE WITH LITTLE CROW ON THE RAMPAGE. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARM INDIANS WITH GUNS. HIS POOR CHILDREN. I WARNED HIM TO STAY AWAY. THEY LEFT HIM DEAD. LITTLE CROW'S ESCAPED CUSTODY. THERE WILL BE NO JUSTICE. THEM SIOUX COULD LINK UP WITH THE DAKOTAS. THEY SAY LITTLE CROW LEFT 200 DEAD. YOU CAN'T TRUST INDIANS. THAT'S HOW IT WILL BE HERE. THE DAKOTAS ARE DIFFERENT. I'VE MET WITH TUKENBHESKA. HE AND HIS PEOPLE RESPECT US NOW. THAT WASN'T RESPECT I SAW ON THE FACE OF KEHTANA. THAT WAS HATE I SAW IN HIS EYES. IT'S GOT ME WORRIED. WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND THEM. THEY'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND US. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO CHANGE. THERE WON'T BE ANY UNDERSTANDING IF WE DON'T TREAT EACH OTHER AS NEIGHBORS. I DON'T FEEL LIKE COUNTING NO INDIANS AMONGST MY NEIGHBORS! TOM? HMM? WHAT IF WE GET AMBUSHED TONIGHT? WE'D BE ASLEEP. WE WOULDN'T KNOW. SOME WOULD BE IF THE REST WOULD QUIT TALKING. I'M SO AFRAID, CAROLINE. INDIANS ON THE WARPATH. YOU SAID THE WEST WASN'T WILD. THEY'RE NOT ON THE WARPATH. FATHER'S RIGHT ABOUT THE DAKOTAS. HE KNOWS THEM BETTER THAN ANYBODY. MR. WOODLAWN! MR. WOODLAWN! MR. WOODLAWN! MR. WOODLAWN! MR. WOODLAWN, THIS IS IT! THIS IS IT! WHAT? WHAT? IT'S STARTED! I SAW IT. I WENT TO WARN EVERYBODY. OTHERS HAD HEARD IT. CALM DOWN, ROBERT. WHAT DID YOU HEAR? AT THE TAVERN, THIS FELLOW SAYS THE INDIANS ARE GATHERING FOR AN UPRISING. WHAT INDIANS? WHERE? THE DAKOTAS! WHO ELSE? I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES. THE SKEEL HOUSE... ALL AFLAME. THE SKEELS? OH, NO. THICK BLACK SMOKE POURING OUT THE DOORS, REDSKINS DRAGGING BODIES OUT. I HIGHTAILED IT TO TOWN TO SOUND THE ALARM! THE MASSACRE HAS STARTED. FOLKS ARE COMING. THEY'RE COMING HERE? WE NEED A SOLID FRONT. WE'LL NEED FOOD. JOHN, WE'LL NEED TURKEYS. ANNABELLE, HELP ME START BAKING. YOU AND THE CHILDREN WILL SLEEP IN THE PARLOR. MRS. JAMIESON, TAKE YOUR THINGS UPSTAIRS. STAY CALM. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENED. I KNOW WHAT I SAW, MR. WOODLAWN. TUKENBHESKA WAS ALWAYS ALLIED WITH LITTLE CROW. ARE WE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THEY KILL US? I'D LIKE TO RIDE OUT TO THE SKEEL PLACE AND LOOK AROUND. I AIN'T GOING, NOT WITH THE SKEEL FAMILY SHOT, AND PROBABLY WITH THEM GUNS YOU MADE UP, WOODLAWN. I'LL GO, FATHER. ALL RIGHT. SADDLE UP, SON. OH, UNCLE JOHN IS VERY BRAVE, ISN'T HE? YOU'RE NOT GOING IN THAT HOUSE! GRAB THEM! AHH! LET GO! LET ME GO! LET ME GO! LEAVE THEM ALONE, MR. IRETON! THEY'RE INDIANS! THEY HAPPEN TO BE MY FRIENDS! INDIANS GOT NO FRIENDS! ROBERT! ROBERT! ROBERT! YOU LET GO OF ME! WHAT HAS COME OVER YOU? THEY'RE ONLY CHILDREN! REDSKINS ARE REDSKINS! THEY'RE GOING BACK WHERE THEY BELONG. LET ME GO! PUT THAT GUN DOWN UNLESS YOU'LL USE IT ON ME. DON'T YOU DARE STAND UP TO ME! BOYS, GO INTO THE HOUSE. CADDIE, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? COME ON. I'VE NEVER SEEN MR. IRETON LIKE THAT. IT'S FRIGHTENING. DON'T WORRY, CADDIE. THEY'RE SAFE IN HERE. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM NOW THAT SAM'S BEEN KILLED? WE'LL HAVE TO SEE THAT THEY'RE TAKEN CARE OF, WON'T WE? YES, AND LIKE YOU SAID, WE DON'T CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK, DO WE? NO, WE DON'T. NOW LISTEN TO ME! WELL, I'M TIRED OF WAITING! I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE INDIANS DO. THEY AMBUSH. WE SHOULD ATTACK FIRST, WIPE OUT THE LOT OF THEM. IT'S THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THAT COUNTS. I KNOW WHERE THEY'RE CAMPED. MORE WILL COME, FROM ALL OVER THE TERRITORY. THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG. MASSACRE THESE DAKOTAS, THAT WILL SEND A MESSAGE THAT WE MEAN BUSINESS. YOU FELLOWS WORK FOR JOHN WOODLAWN. HE'S A REASONABLE MAN. WE SHOULD WAIT FOR HIM. IF WE DO IT, WE DO IT NOW. ALL IN? [ANIMAL HOWLS] [OWL HOOTING] HEY, IRETON, MRS. WOODLAWN'S BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU. AAH! AAH! AAH! NO! WHAT'S THAT? THERE'S SOMEBODY COMING DOWN THE SOUTH ROAD! HEY! HOLD YOUR FIRE! THEY'VE GOT CADDIE. CADDIE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES. LET HER GO, TUKENBHESKA. I'M ALL RIGHT. DON'T YOU SEE? HE'S OUR FRIEND. IT LOOKS LIKE HE BROUGHT SOME FRIENDS. LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE! THEY'RE ONLY PROTECTING HIM! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! OH, NO! PLEASE, DON'T! CHIEF TUKENBHESKA-- PLEASE... LET HER COME TO ME, PLEASE. HOLD IT! FATHER! STOP THEM! JOHN! HOLD IT. NOW, WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING? LOOK OVER THERE! LOOK OVER THERE! MAX SKEEL! YOU'RE ALIVE! THERE HAS BEEN NO INDIAN ATTACK. IRETON SAID YOU WAS MURDERED. WE'RE ALIVE AS WE EVER BEEN. WE'RE ALL JUST FINE. YOU SAW A SOAP KETTLE FIRE. TALLOW SPILLED IN THE FIRE. WIND BLEW SMOKE THROUGH THE HOUSE. THANK GOD SOME DAKOTAS CAME. WITHOUT THEIR HELP, WE NEVER WOULD HAVE GOT THAT FIRE OUT. YOU SAW WHAT YOU WANTED. WE KNOW THE TRUTH NOW. THESE PEOPLE HAVE PLEDGED THEIR RESPECT. THEY'VE SHOWN THEIR FRIENDSHIP. THEY WANT TO LIVE IN PEACE. WE ALL WANT PEACE. YOU ARE A GOOD FRIEND. BLESS YOU. THANK YOU. CADDIE, YOU SURE WERE BRAVE. WELL, SO WERE YOU, TOM. PLEASE DON'T BE ANGRY, MOTHER. I WAS SO SCARED. SO WAS I, DARLING. I AM SO PROUD THAT YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER, CADDIE. YOU LISTENED TO YOUR CONSCIENCE. YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO. THERE ARE MANY THINGS I COULD TEACH YOU, BUT I COULD NEVER TEACH YOU THAT. OH, BABY. [WHISTLE BLOWS] EDMUND! IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU! WELCOME BACK. HOW ARE YOU DOING? BUT WHERE IS CADDIE AND ANNABELLE? LOOK AT THIS! DO MY EYES DECEIVE ME, OR IS THIS CADDIE AND ANNABELLE? HELLO, UNCLE EDMUND. HELLO, UNCLE EDMUND. I WISH YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE ME HOME. I HAVE A LOT TO CATCH UP ON. SAY... I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU, CADDIE. A NICE LADY IN HANNIBAL FOUND HIM WANDERING THE STREETS. HE'S PERFECTLY TRAINED NOW. HE'LL SIT FOR HOURS. NERO! [BARKING] NERO! GET THE OTHER STICK! I GUESS... SOME THINGS DON'T CHANGE THAT EASILY AFTER ALL, DO THEY? OH, WELL. I CAN'T IMAGINE US BEING ANY HAPPIER THAN WE ARE RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT. NERO!
