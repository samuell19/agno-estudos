- Do you have an invitation? - I don't have one. Then I'm sorry. Get out. You were on Tie Saint-Louis tonight. You mean at your own house? I wanted to see it. I've told you before not to meddle in my affairs. But... I'm your son. If you want money, you'll get it. Women, there's no shortage. But mind your own business. I could have been killed last night. Stay out of my business. So that's it. You hold private parties on Tie Saint-Louis, you kidnap a girl, and no one says anything. I've had enough. I'm going to find out what my father and his two partners are up to. One more thing, Solange, please tell my son I won't be home for supper. I have business to attend to. - And serve us some drinks. Everything is fine. I follow his every step. Don't worry, he won't see me. Everywhere he goes I'll be there, in the shadows. So, the show- We didn't come for that. What's going on? Are the premises suitable? I hope you know what you're doing, Radamante. - All this is costing a fortune. - Not to mention the risks. Everything is as I like it. You must leave quickly. You'll find your father at his office. Go there at once. Other mysteries await you. Is that you, Pierre? I'm very busy. What? Animal men? A young girl? What are you talking about? You want me to come down in the car in the middle of the night? You're in danger? I'm coming. Where are you? Drive you to your father's office? Wait for me. There was a spy at the town house. - Who was it? - I don't know. He ran away. We must clear the town house and bring her here. Leave it to me. She'll be here before dawn. What's this? Blood analyses with names and occupations. Night watchman, bouncer - they all work at night. There are hundreds of them. Blood, night- And why the girl's photo on the wall? She could be a robot. That explains why the bullet didn't kill her. She put her hand on my face. I touched her. She's not a robot. Sir, they have just caught two men. They showed their faces - in front of her. - What? Did she see them? One of them is your son. What's this, Radamante? Does your son know about it? My son knows nothing. So why is he here in the middle of the night? Bring my son right away. Don't forget, I have the most to lose here. - But- - No buts. The only way out of this is to give part of the solution to my son. Who is that girl? How did she survive those bullets? Who are those lunatics who kill themselves in the town house? What are they doing here? Why do they put hoods on when the girl goes by? Since you ask specific questions, I'll give you straight answers. Firstly, that girl is my protege. She's an orphan. I am all she has. Secondly, she suffers from an unknown blood condition. Any wounds she has heal right away as long as her vital organs aren't injured. Thirdly, in the eyes of some fanatics, she is a goddess. I was happy for this suicide sect, which worships her, to use my town house. That's it. We are searching for someone with the same blood type as her, and therefore the same disease, to try to cure her. We look at people who live at night, because those with her condition can't tolerate sunlight. The hoods are to hide their faces from her She has never seen another human being. She mustn't know she is different She would suffer too much. Satisfied? - No. - What do you mean “no”? You're an accomplice to murder at your town house. Why? Do you know who your prisoner is? That's enough. We're not detaining her, we're protecting her from those who want her for motives less noble than ours. What are your motives? We're scientists, researchers. Listen, Pierre. I'll let you go, you and your friend. Give me 48 hours to justify myself. Come back tomorrow and you'll find out everything. Robert will accept the delay. Forty-eight hours. Beyond that, I don't promise anything. My dear friend, we must hush this up. otherwise we both risk being compromised. The corpses that have been found near my town house - My name mustn't be - Your name? Understood, my friend. Understood. I'll see you very soon. Mr. Gray, is that you? It's Radamante. Sell everything, even at a low price, the town house on Tie Saint-Louis, the office building, everything. That's an order. What do you have for sale? I need something discreet, isolated, something outside of Paris. I must be able to move in today. Is the château furnished? How far is it from Paris? Sixty miles? Perfect. We leave in an hour. Lock the girl in the van so no sunlight can penetrate. Get the bags ready. You're coming with me. Notify my associates to join us here with two armed drivers. - We'll be safe here. - But what are you afraid of? It was I who found the girl. There are others of her species. Someone's coming. Mr. Radamante, I can't accompany you, but the doors are open. The château belongs to you now. Treat it with respect. - But- - He leaves just like that. We don't even know where the rooms are. It's not important. Come along. This will suit me nicely. Solange will join us tonight. My son stayed in Paris. As for his friend Robert - Ah, yes, what about him? He knows too much. You needn't worry. In a few minutes, he'll be gone. Who will do the job? Who else are you going to involve? Solange. At this very moment, she should be with him. But my son mustn't know of it. Robert was his friend. To what do I owe the pleasure? - I've come to ask you for help. - Ask me? I want to leave Radamante. He's going to commit more crimes. That girl is a vampire. She feeds on human blood. Radamante wants her power of immortality. For that, he needs someone with her type of blood, another vampire with whom to mate her. But tell me, what are they doing? They organized that suicide cult who kill themselves to feed her. They don't yet know how vampires recognise each other. They research, analyse, survey. They must be stopped. Where are they all? Have they fled? Your father and his associates have left Paris. I have stayed behind to pass on his orders to you. Where is your friend? Robert is at home. He wants nothing more to do with my father. Forty-eight hours from now, he will call the police. Unless, that is, my father proves he is innocent. I want that girl. I want to know her secret. - Voringe. Voringe! - What is it? It's me, Fredor. Can you hear it? - The drum? Of course I can. - What is it? - Where is Radamante? - Come on, we'll find him. What is it? It's you. - Can you hear it? - It must be the drivers. Drivers? Playing the drums in the middle of the night? Wake up the drivers. Make sure they're armed. Both of them are dead. That's the signal. She is free. - Pierre, you've arrived in time. - Don't touch her. What's going on? They are going to attack us. They tried to kidnap the girl. I'd like to believe you. Shut the doors. She mustn't see the daylight. We must prepare for a siege. We'll discuss it later. - Well? - Pierre has arrived at the château. They have shut themselves in the library. The young girl is in their hands again. We won't attack tonight. It'll be daylight soon. We must free her. I don't want to take the risk of fighting until then. I'm waiting for your explanation. The problem is simple. We need to find a way to feed her. I want to know the whole story. This girl has an immense power: immortality. Those who only feed on blood and can't tolerate sunlight have this power. - Like vampires? - Yes, like vampires. We have been trying to find out how such a physiological marvel could exist. But we had to leave Paris mainly because of you and your friend. I understand. You want her powers. But, Pierre, think about it. Immortality! At what price? You tortured her in your laboratories, you subjected her to your experiments, you terrorized her with your strange guardians. - You kept others from her view. - Until today. Thanks to you, she has seen our faces now. - Who are your enemies? - Other monsters, no doubt. Monsters? I thought you were protecting her. All right, I want to see these monsters. Who are you looking for? Your friend was killed tonight. Robert is dead? But how? He was killed on the orders of your father. On the orders of my father? I've seen this sign before. The woman who saved my life at the town house by killing one of the animal men wore the same sign. You, too, will carry the sign one day, like us, like her. The girl? She is one of us. You, too, are one of us. Don't you know that yet? Who are you? On the grounds you'll find someone with the answers to your questions. Who are you? What are you doing? - I was meditating. - Why? Because within these walls, there are innocents locked up. And a crime will be committed soon. - A crime? Are you a priest? No, I'm not a priest of any religion, although I celebrate a cult because those who will be killed have protected the life of someone who is mine. - The girl? She's mine too. Is it possible to keep her alive without any more sacrifices? Yes, I can. You can. They shot at her, and she's alive. Who is she? I'm the one who knows. You are one of us. What you have seen tonight, what you will see, is not real. Your father and his associates believe in vampires. So they will see vampires. But before dawn, the mysteries will become clear, and evil will be punished. As for you, let me be your guide. Look at me. And you will know the one who you are destined for. Now, leave me. Before the last crime is committed, I must meditate again. You have betrayed me, you little pests. I have always despised you. But now, there will be no more obstacles between me and Radamante. Pierre took these risks. But where is Solange? Ah, Solange. Well? Robert is dead. - Two other traitors have also paid. - Who? Your two loyal little puppies, Mr. Radamante. They told your son everything. I fear he is against us. Shoot, Solange, shoot. Quick, we must escape. We are powerless against them. We can't hurt them. I'll give the signal to attack. Take care of her. Don't let her get near the fighting. Let's go. Please, take it. So... you're not vampires? Who are you? Let them go. They have lost and they know it. You must return to the château. You must go and see your father and his associates. Afterwards, you will be one of us. But how will I find you? Await guidance, you'll find us. Pierre, listen to me. I'm going to guide you. The time has come for you to gain the knowledge. Here's another one. I'm so happy. He's so young. Come, come. I have arrived. We know. You always end up coming here. We guide you here. We await your arrival, with the same joy, for over fifty years. In a moment, you will go through those curtains. This is just an antechamber. We will never meet again. Let us look at you a little longer. They are gone so quickly. Is it true? You don't know yet? You don't know who you are? Who we all are? I know you. You are the one destined for the young girl. The girl? - Where is she? - Don't be impatient. The time has come for you to know. Here, take this ring and go through the curtains. now our waking commences. Sometimes two come, sometimes three. Sometimes none at all. We just have to wait. He went in there. We must follow him. - I think it's too dangerous. - You can no longer count on us. Very well, I'll go alone. Do you understand all this? No. I think she was a vampire Radamante kept prisoner for twenty years. - But was she a vampire in the end? - I don't know. The experiments were inconclusive. That's true. All my capital went into that town house and the office block. The only thing they found out was that the girl's blood belongs to an unknown type. It's a bit limited to conclude that she was a vampire. She was perhaps no more a vampire than you or I. - You forget all those immortals. - Well, these things happen. Radamante must have thought when kidnapping her that one day her family would look for her. If Pierre hadn't interfered, the vampires wouldn't have found us. Oh, him! Fallen in love with a vampire. Can you believe it? But is she a vampire? She is something. In any case, vampire or werewolf, we are ruined. - What will happen to Radamante? - Too bad for him. Anyway, now that they have managed to lure him to the château, there's little chance of seeing him alive. He's not immortal. - Where is my son? - Careful, this man is not - It won't work. We are not in the same dimension. In reality, you haven't left the château. - Where is the vampire? - You are the real vampire. You made her accustomed to drinking blood. You kept her from sunlight. Look. For the first time, she sees sunlight. She is one of us, like Pierre. We aren't vampires. One day, the human race will be like this young girl, your son and I. All will have the power of immortality. We are the prototype of future man. The first mutation of the human race, announcing tomorrow's race. Vampires have never existed, but there are mutants. You will all disappear. You are powerless against us. You are powerless against evolution. Tomorrow, today, at any moment, the day of the mutants may arrive.
