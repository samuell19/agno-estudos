You already want to go home? Yes, I promised OK. Let's go for a quick walk and you escort me home. Ag reed. No... Help... I... No! Let get out quick. You hear me! I wasn't allowed to tell the press. And you bugged my phone. What else do you want from me?! That you make an effort to work together with the police. Only thanks to you, my daughter hasn't been released yet. I'm under the impression you prefer working with the blackmailers. They asked for money, and I'm gonna pay them. Are you aware what that means? Facilitation of a crime. What else should I do? Just wait? Yeah ok. Do whatever you like. But it's on your own risk. I want my daugter back. No matter how. Where is the toilet, please? Back there. Thank you. It's time. Here we go. Stop! Stop or I'll shoot. Scram! Stop! Stop! Help! Stop it! I'm suffocating! Stop! Help! There they are. There you are. In there. Stay inside! Don't be afraid. I'm police. Well, that should be it. Come here. It's all good. Everything is over. Into the car. Quickly into the car. And the others? Don't you take them with you? Goddammit! I thought you had him. Unfortunately he got away. I bet it was the Moroccan. And you let him escape! Finishes this damn gang, sets the girl free ancl still isn't satisfied. Unbelievable. What else does he want? Don't you understand you sh0uldn't play a lone hand? This would have been patrol duty's area of responsibility. What should I do? Letting them leave? No, but at least informing chief Crivetti. Ah. Good evening, chief. Good evening. Mariani in peak form. Obviously back from a super operation. Doing what I can to ask for trouble. I don't remember giving you some sort of order. What else was I supposed to do? You were busy with the magistrate, the superintendent, the head of the Carabinieri... You come up with an excuse again. If not you would really be in deep shit. But I always luck out. Ain't that right? Yes? Good evening chief. 3 criminals were killed in the action. The chief of patrol, inspector Crivetti, emphasizes that his team had been tailing the gang for quite a while. As the abducted girl still is under shock, she couldn't be questioned yet. But the detective squad assumes that the abducted must have remained in that small cellar dungeon where she was found for the whole 42 clays of her captivity. Also the complete amount of the ransom could be recovered. The first contact between the abductors and engineer Pinelli took place already two days after the abduction. The claimed amount was 2 billion Lira. The hideaway where the girl was kept prisoner is a barn on the estate of a certain Aldo Moroni, against whom a manhunt was initiated. The spectacular rescue mission is the merit of Det. Mariani and his assistant Pratti. And now more news of the day. Compared to previous month's numbers the unemployment rate has increased again in an alarming way... Where do you wanna go? Can't you answer? No!? Whom do you wanna see? Ringing is of no use. The inspector is on duty today. If you had told me from the beginning where you wanted to go you could have saved yourself the stairs. Just comes in here, doesn't open his mouth and keeps ringing the doorbell. Has he gone on patrol? No. He isn't with them anymore. He now is in the police station. Which station? Good morning, gentlemen. I see you are all very busy. Good morning, chief. Good morning. What an adoring sunday, isn't it? Yes, you name it. So what? Next sunday it's us who get to go to the sea. No. This isn't for me. I'm a non-swimmer. Then we go to the countryside. Monti. I need you. Again an offence report Who from? The nutbag from Via Verardi. Always the same. Another one of her cats was poisoned. We should do something. She gets more and more annoying. She already wrote to the superintendend. Who knows? Claudio might still be sleeping. Today he's becoming eight. And you are not with your son today? Someone could substitute you. Well... later I'll stop by. No no. You better go right away. Later you won't be getting anywhere. Would you replace me for an hour? My pleasure. Of course. No worries. As long as you wish. Thank you. To inspector Mariani please. Not here. I was told he is here. Here? He went out. Why d0n't you g0 to the inspector in charge... No! I only want to talk to Mariani. Then you will have to wait. I don?t mind. I'll wait. Be my guest. Good afternoon, Signor Mariani. Good afternoon. Is my wife at home? Yes. I'll tell her at once that you are here. Please come in. You are as chaotic as ever. I am used to being looked after at all time. If you only would have agreed to the position my father offered you... But instead you're doing your stupid job. I'm not an industrial. If you wanna be a bum, go ahead. I'm only good in my field. This is what I really know. Yes, but leave me ancl my son alone. Our son... Our Son! Who are you waiting for? Inspector Mariani. It might take a while till he comes back. Whoever shows up for duty on a sunday mostly stays only briefly and clears out again. Mauro! Mauro! Claudio! How are you? Good. Do you have something for me? Yeah. Let me show you later. First I wanna say hello to your mother. Good afternoon. Vera, does your room always have to be such a mess? As you see to be a bit more neat. How are you doing? How is a woman who is almost constantly alone supposed to do? You could do domething against it. Even with another partner I would be alone. Like I was with you. What is it, Mauro? Let's go in the garden and play cops ancl robbers? Tell me why d0n't you say daddy to me? Come on, Mauro. Let's play. Excuse me, may I ask you a question? Of course. The man who went past just before, was it inspector Mariani? It's because I don't know him. Who went into that office? Yes. Let me see. No. You were wrong. Thank you Hello? Yes. Just a moment. Stand-by-duty? Oh it's you, Doctor. No, he still isn't here. One sec, ok? Chief super intendend. It's Dr. Ingravallo. He wants to talk to the chief. Dr. Ingravallo. Here Monti speaking. Yes yes. Mariani is on duty, but he is not here at the moment. What? Yes... yes. No no, he'll be here soon I'm sure. I only can't tell when exactly. Just if it's an emergency. He's paying his son a visit. Yes, bye. Place it on his desk. Yes ok. What are you doing in here? How did you get in? Get out. Hurry! Leave! You have no place in here. Listen! Shut up! You got that? Have you gone mad? Or I'll wack you. Go back in there. You must ne crazy. You do as I say! Or I'll shoot your brains out. Move! Back in there. Go! Monti. Holy moly. Call your inspector. He shall come here. Ancl fast! What do you have to tell him that is so urgent? Y0u'll know when I kill him. What are you up to? Say that again? Over there with you! Sit down! The guy must be crazy. If you don't do what I ask of you, he'll kick the bucket. I'll wack him. Plain and simple! You realize you are in a police station? If you only fire a shot, each and every policeman in town will be there and ready for action. You get that? Sure! But till then he'll be clead! Your guns! In here! All of them! In here! One after the other. Safisfied? Now put the gun away and let's talk. Call your inspector. He should come. And fast. Turn around. Hands up. Make a move. Bang! Oh, you got me good. I'm afraid he'll be that tactless and wants to stay for lunch. You should be happy I didn't shoot you in the leg. You only say that But you do suddenly do again, yes? Mother! Please! Signora. Thank you. And now what? Hands UP! Mauro! No, let me go. Give it to me. Not my gun... - Mauro! - N0, let me go. Yes? - Telephone! - Yes, I'm coming! Leave me. Did you see? This is how you are tricked. I'll get you, Mauro. Go on and try to catch me. Hello? Ah it's you, Platti. Claudio, your are all sweaty. Yes, Monti did the right thing. Yes. I'll drive there at once. Hey. Why do you wanna go again? Claudio, the police is like the fatherland. Once it calls, you have to go. That's how it is. Listen. I have to go unfortunately. Ancl fast. But I'll be back at 1PM. And then we'll go and eat something together. And we'll take your mother with you. D0 VOLI agree? OK. As you wish, Mauro. Ciao. - Ciao. Convince yourself. Nobody's answering. Who knows which number that was? The right one. He's not here. He left. At least it's his son's birthday today. He'll be on a trip with him and his wife. And you can stay here and wait until kingdom come. No! You said before he'll be coming back. OK OK. Suppose he is coming back, ok? And you shoot him? This will get you in the pen. I c0uldn't careless. He has to croak! What did he do to you? He had my father confined. Jailed him. OK. Got it. Ancl then? He hung himself! Excuse me, inspector. - Morning. Sorry I had to disturb you. Where is he? Down there. That one? - Yes. Do you have another one for me? No, this is an order from Monti. Here you go, chief superintendend. Two cold, two hot, one capuccino, one waffle, as ordered. Correct? Put everything down and stay put. Well, I'll be damned. Who is this? And this on a sunday morning. Well. I got it ancl am outta here. See you. Stay where you are or I'll waste you. Are you nuts? Don't provoke him ancl you don't be upset. Don't be upset? I'm terrified. Over there to the others. Who is this and what does he want? Who are you calling? The guard. This room might be crowded with people any minute. And I'm the inspector on duty. Got it? If someone files a complaint, they'll send him over to me right away. Go on and make your call. But make no mistake. Yes? - It's me, Monti. I hear you. I don't wanna be disturbed by anyone. Come again? A- ny-one. Absolutely anyone? I beg your pardon, but you're on duty, aren't you? No no no. Do exactly as I say. Even if it's urgent? To whom am I gonna send the people? I don't give a flying fuck. Whereever you want if you ask me. I never was a snitch, inspector. Now you wanna nick an innocent man. A fine innocent. You are the worst pimp around. I only help you if I get my licence back. Ag reed. You have my word. But first we need to catch him. Do you expect me to carry the moroccan and place him at your feet? I can tell you where he is hiding. But you have to get him yourselves. Patrol duty is going to accomplish that. I only want the licence for my pub back again. He's hiding at his girlfriends, Rita Parolini. Via Sepino 11. rear house, last floor. But you didn't get that tip from me. Let's go. Move. You see? It's almost noon. And he still hasn't come back. But he will come back. Listen carefully. I don't get it. Your father obviously killed himself... unfortunately. Where do you see Mariani's fault? Mariani's fault? After all he was the one to nick him. If he has locked him in, he must have clone something, no? But you think your father was innocent. My father... couldn't take it in prison. And because he couldn't escape, he hung himself. This is Mariani's fault! Listen. Give me the gun ancl scam. I promise I will forget this whole thing here. Scout's honor. Nothing happened here. Nothing at all. We'll also forget your face. And I can go back to my bar. No! D0n't you dare move! Yes, alright. I'm staying. OK. Inspector? Why so itchy all the time? Shouldn't I notify patrol? No... The concierge! Hello! Hello? Anyone here? Police. What do you want? Police. I already realized something stinks here. Bring us to Parolini. Rear house, last floor. I'm busy. Can't you go up alone? - No. We prefer your company. Okay! Just a moment. The milk is still on the hotplate. Leave it there. Come with me. We want to surprise Miss Polinelli. Where is the fun when we announce ourselves? What officials are you? Yes. This is kind of... our vice. Here. There she lives. A moment. Please tell exactly like I said to you. D0n't make any mistakes. Who is there? The concierge. I'm sorry to bother you that early on a sunday morning. My aplogies, but in the signora's appartment below there's water dripping through the ceiling. Can I please come in to check what might be the problem? I could as well come tomorrow, but the signora insists. Would you please open the door? Who are you? What do you want? Bruno! Bruno! - Freeze! No! N0! I'm not letting you in! You don't have a warrant! This is my appartment! Well then, see you tomorrow. Yes, last floor. You seem to have notified patrol? Of course I did. I'll catch him after all. From your lips to G0d's ears. We'll ask his girlfriend. She'll know for sure where he went. I won't say a word. Bring her to the station. I will call in the meantime. Get dressed. Hurry! Hurry. I'm flying. With which car shall I drive? Take mine. Come again? Here Mariani. Give me Monti. No! You want to trick me. He shall talk to the inspector. Who says that this is the inspector? Tell him to come! Yes? Here Buranelli. No. The inspector is not here. Don't move! Are you crazy? What the hell did you do? You killed him. What was that? - Something fell maybe. Is he clead? We need a doctor. He's still breathing. Now do exactly as I say. You go to the door now and tell them a bullet accidentally was fired. And you all back over there. Move! But if you trick me, you're a dead man! Go! Go on! Over there with you. Move! What happened? Who fired a shot? Nothing... ahm... nothing at all. Buranelli's gun accidentally went off during cleaning. Bura? This guy sh0uldn't even own a slingshot. Close the door! Go! Pronto! What is it? Are you sleeping? Give me Monti. Ciao, Mariani. Let's see whether he gets away another time? The whole house is surrounded. Comb the cellar ancl the roof terraces. Well... A tough nut to crack, this moroccan. Why haven't I heard from you about that? Because I didn't wanna lose time. Well clone once more. But... to catch him would have been patrol's task. The tip wasn't safe enough. Couldn't have been better for you. A man like you surely must have taken into consideration he will escape us again. You still seem to think your transfer was out of envy because of your success. But that's not true. No? Why then? Cause you are a good pickup artist, but you need to learn to accept no for an answer. Aha? Thanks for nothing. Y0u're better preserved in the station, Mariani. Where can I make a call? My place, if you don't have official secrets. No, it's private - Well then, come in. Up the stairs, and then left. Hello? Who is this? It's your Ex. I bet he can't come. What is it? Did you change your mind? No no. Only that I ended up at the other end of the city and need to go to the station again right after. Well, then let's forget about it. But Claudio doesn't wanna eat without you. No no no. I won't eat today without Mauro! Be still. You go and explain that to your son. OK. good. Hand him over. Claudio? Listen carefully. Now please obey your daddy. Claudio? No. I don't wanna eat without you. Ok Ok. Give mommy to me. - Yes. Hello? Yes? In the station. Good idea. Maybe it's best if you set off directly and wait for me in my office? OK? Ciao. Signora? Yes? What's in there? The depot of some sort of plasticware company. Hands in the air. Is this supposed to be a joke? What's going on here? Hands UP! Hey you, barman. Why me? Disarm them. - Me? Yes, you! Hurry! Get their guns. Excuse me. Isn't this just superb? In front of me on the desk. Yes, please. Here. What happend to him? Stay away. Back to your place! Leave me the hell alone. You can't do that to me, you moron. Nobody move. And you... To the others. If he doesn't go into a hospital now, he'll die. He's losing loads of blood. Eventhough he is a pig, he's still a human being. Listen. After all it's already 2 o'clock. Who says the inspector will still come? If he doesn't, one of you has warned him. And then you're next. S0 Yes it is! Oh Boy. What a birthday! If Mauro doesn't come soon, he'll get to know me. You think so? Well go on and let him know how you feel. Poor gl-IY- And this is all on you, you pig! Shut up. Claudio! Come, be a good kid. Well, I'm going over to my friend Monti. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon, Monti. What are you doing with that gun? Claudio. Come here. Signor Monti doesn't have... Signora. You must have chosen the wrong door. Please take your child with you and leave again. No! The kid stays! Mariani is your father? What father? Mariani isn't even married. Get out. Leave him. Leave him or I'll shoot. It'll be him. Not you! Signora. Do as he says. This leads nowhere, Signora. Leave him! Come on! Quick! Over there to the wall. Next to the others! He already shot Agnoini. Come here! I'm not joking. You got that? Over there with him, or... Go on... and fast! Next to the others! And not the slightest peep! Mommy! Mommy! Leave me. What do you want from me? Let me go! And tell Mariani he'll hear from me. Let me go. In there. Hurry! You won again. My decision is final. Because everything has to be done my way! Because I need your brains. And not in the sense of risking it out on the street. Chief inspector. It's Headquarters. What now? Crivetti. What is it? Something terrible happened in a police station. In which one? The one of inspector Mariani. He is still near, isn't he? Don't panic. I'm sure he won't harm the kid. He's only using him as hostage. This was directed at you. What did he say before he left? Tell Mariani he'll hear from me. There you go. He'll be in touch soon. I'm gonna find him very soon. If I only knew who he is. Maybe he escaped. I'm contacting all jails. But as we have sunday... Here Costa. The autocar registry office. Yes yes. I'm writing it down. Yes. Yes, OK. Yes... Yes And the owner's name? Look it up when he was born. 1937. Where does he live? The 127 doesn't belong to him. Thank you. The owner is 48 years old. So he gave it away. Or it got stolen. Let me take care of it. If you're OK with it. Well then. Here you go. Here you have all informations. - Thanks. The only thing you could do, was mingling around like idiots and write down the licence plate number instead of wrenching the child from him. And risk his life? He would have shot again without blinking an eye. Yes, Mauro. Monti is right. Not even you... could have clone something, not even lift a finger. I'll take care of the stolen car. I want out! Help! Let me out! Shut your mouth! Be still! Yes Yes, I understand. No. I'm not going anywhere. Sure. I'll keep you on the running. A certain Conforti... hung himself Friday night. Spoleto Prison, where he was in custody. This can't be! That's not our fault. Where do you wanna go, Mariani? Answer! Stay here, Mariani. Be reasonable. Where do you wanna look for him? What else should I do? Just wait? You know it. He doesn't want any ransom. He wants your head! And I want my son! He left very early this morning. I'm certain because I saw him on the staircase, on my way back from church. And his mother? Ah, the mother. She works for some family all clay, as her fine son doesn't care about her. She will be there today, too. Their name is Corti and they live in Nr 20. Why I'm working today although my husband hung himself? Because I don't wanna lose my job here. I won't tell anything to your people. This is very nice of you, inspector. They treat me well. I... I never had much luck in my life. Neither with my husband, nor with my son. Listen. I need to find him. But I don't know anything from Sergio. He only shows up, when he needs money. For him I'm nothing but a maid. For him... only his father counted. He was like God for him. You might know some of his friends? Only bad friends. Whenever I was looking for him, he was with those in that bar at the corner. So? So? I got it, inspector. But we really can't help you. None of us knows a Sergio Conforti. We just heard someone pulled a fast one on him. That's all we know. Ev! We d0n't give a shit who you're looking for. Please listen, guys. It's very important to me. Would you think about taking to your heels? Not with me, moron! You only picked me because I'm weaker! No. Beacause I know for a fact that you know Conforti. Now spit it out where I can find him. I have no idea. Ask Maciste if you're not a chicken. Come over, you pig. I'm Maciste. Let him have it, Maciste. Go on. Spit it out! Where is he? I don't know. I have no idea. Nando. Go tell him. Go on. You know it. Sergio Conforti is a friend of his. Why d0n't you tell him? Or you're breaking your neck. For g0d's sake talk or I'll bite the dust. Leave Maciste alone and Nando will sing like a bird, inspector. He's probably at the junkyard where he works sometimes. Also on a sunday. Or at his girlfriends. A certain Wanda Giuliani. Now leave him. He has told you everything he knew. What else do you want know? Hit me? No. But you will accompany me to this Wanda. Pass me the inspector. It's him. Talk to him. Inspector Mariani isn't here at the moment. But you can talk to me. I'm his colleague. I'm only dealing with him. Did you hear? Only with him! Listen. If you have to say something, do it. I'm only dealing with him. We still haven't reached him yet. I'll let him know as soon as he gets in touch If he wants his son back, he'll have to come for him. Well fine. Ancl where? The inspector knows! He knows time and place. But he has to come alone! Got it? Nobody will be there on a sunday. I c0uldn't tell why he should be here. Because it's an excellent hideout. Inbetween all these cars here. Back there stands a 127. Sergio! Sergio! The inspector promised me he won't do you any harm, if you release the child. Sergio, come out! This is his car, right? Yes, that's the one he was driving with. Maybe he'sover th ere in the garage? Good heavens. Inspector. If the car is here, he must have taken the motorcycle. I'm sure he didn't proceed on foot. Or he is here. Claudio! My 90d! That's pretty steep! My gate was crashed and my car stolen. By god, I have more important matters to care about now. Hey. There is my car. Look. There it is! Inspector. Inspector. I've been looking all over for you. Finally I found you. I've got news. The kidnapper got in touch with us. He called. He said you knew where he took the child. I... Inspector Mariani isn't here at the moment. But you can talk to me. I'm his colleague. I'm only dealing with him. Did you hear? Only with him! Listen. If you have to say something, do it. I'm only dealing with him. We still haven't reached him yet. I'll let him know as soon as he gets in touch. If he wants his son back, he'll have to come for him. Well fine. Ancl where? The inspector knows! He knows time and place. But he has to come alone! Got it? That's all. Dou you understand that? And where you have to go? I have no idea. Neither place, nor time. I understand you, Mariani. You fear that if we come along, we'd endanger your son's life. But there's still the other side: This madman poses a threat to us all. That's why it is our duty to take him out. Consequently I can't let you play one man army. If you know what this guy is talking about you have to let me know. I know as little as you. But one thing I know for sure: I need to go there on my own. Don't forget you are a police officer. Once we know from where he's contacting us, it's gonna be easier for us. And he will call again. Maybe then we can localize him. But is this possible? Why not? If he calls from a phone booth, we can track him only to the district. But if he uses a private line, we got him. If you need me, I am next door. Does Mariani have an escort? Yes. Two special officers follow him unobtrusively. They will make sure he's not losing it again. Why is that? Well, considering his situation... Mister Super-Cop! Anyone could get into such a situation. The boy's father was a criminal. He shot one of us. A nice boy in his early twenties. Should have seen his mother at his funeral. I hunted down the murderer until I got him. Everyone would have acted that way. But now the murderer hung himself in jail. No need to defend yourself then. No. But y0u're adressing reproaches. I'm only pursuing my profession. I know that! Tell the police to go home, the whole lot! Why not dissolve them? And leave our city to these thugs, criminals ancl terrorists! Hello? Are you Mariani? Yes. On the phone. You know I'm awaiting you. Yes. Yes. But I have no idea where I should go. You will know. It's time. If you don't hurry, I'll kill him! I'll be there as fast as I can. And alone! But whereto? You should know. Whereto? Just tell me whereto! The call was recorded. The boy called from a booth at Tivotina trainstation. Somebody noticed him. Inform Mariani. He drove in that direction. And I called you right away. You did good. First I just thought he was only behaving a bit strange. But as I heard him say,,kill?, I called you. Thank you. Not everyone would have reacted that well. We turned the booth upside down... Didn't find anything! What are you thinking, chief inspector? At what time did we catch his father? I think... around midnight. No... it must have been earlier. Y0u're right. It was half ten, ten o'clock. And now it's nine twenty. The barn is not far. Let's drive then. No. I go alone. I will go alone. But Crivetti won't allow it. I don't give a shit about Crivetti! Did you drive with a motorcycle, an old Guzzi? Yes, an old Guzzi. Where does he want to go? Damn! Stop it at the next station. Hurry. Stop it in Tuscolana. Come on. Quick. The cars! He's about to be gunned down. What does he do? He's not stopping. Don't stop yet. I will let you know you when. Is it our fault that he didn't stop? Yeah 0k. Tell Crivetti. No, you go there. I d0n't want any trouble. Ready. Hello, Inspector? Yes, here Crivetti. The train didn't stop unfortunately. Drive back. Further instructions will follow. - OK. Understood. To the headquarters. EXit! One moment... what do you want? Hey you. Stop... Thief! Oh my god. Throw your gun away, inspector! It took you quite a while. This was the exact spot. Here you arrested my father. But you c0uldn't remember, where it happened! For you he was nothing but a small-time-villain. Routine for the grand inspector. Revenge for my father! You are to blame for his death, and you don't even know, where you arrested him! If I didn't know, I wouldn't be here! But you are too late. It was half ten sharp as you arrested him! It's your fault, Mariani, that you came too late now, to save your son. Release my son! It's too late for that! I want my boy! I want my boy! Where is he? Stop! stop! Stop! I must have my son back! Daddy! Daddy, I am here! Daddy, I'm here. Daddy. My boy. I knew you would come and get me, daddy. Finally you call me daddy.
