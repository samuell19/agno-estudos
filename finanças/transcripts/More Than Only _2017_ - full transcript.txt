My Father wanted only two things. Straight A's and a straight son. These were the two non-negotiables in our relationship Standard by which all decisions must be made. Any deviation was quickly corrected. My father never had to say a word I learned quickly that I was not to express my... socially unacepatable traits. Despite the fact I still felt compelled to share them, So, I started to write. I wrote down everything. I also learned, if I was to keep my father on my side. And, eventually just his wallet. My first arranged date, I was 15. I'm sure the enamored look I wore was a sure sign of hope I never told them it wasn't the girl that had captured my attention. Although I could never grow one on my face. Finding a beard for every dance and social event was a simple enough task. All I asked for in return was to be popular. And to carry the reputation of a proud, but maybe a little handsy philanderer. As soon as I graduated, I couldn't wait to get out. I moved far enough away I was out of sight. But not far enough from the financial support. I'm telling you man, with the right take off pattern I can clear ten feet easy this time. If you need to take a break from studying, please go run the track, recite a sonet in the commons, go to the shower and jack off. but do not jump out that window. Aww, you do care. - No, I don't. I just don't want to have to take you to the hospital - Again. I have a physics midterm tomorrow and some of us need to study. Mark, if you don't stop studdying for like a minute. The molecules in your brain are going to start racing away from each other. Till your brain matter literally expands beyond the cranial cavity And All over the walls. Who's gonna clean that up, Mark? We both know that's your thing. And how are we going to get rid of the body? My dad's rich, but not that rich. I'm just gonna have to grind your body up into hot dog paste. Feed it to the students on meal plan. You are seriously disgusting. No wonder people are afraid of you. They're just jelous of me. Justin Johnson Studying? Right now. Staying out of trouble? Of Course. Keeping your nose clean. Sparking sir. Watch it. I'm sorry... Sir. I'd hate to have to cut you off Justin. I know you would. Straight A's. Not a question. As always, Sir. And the other? Under control. It better be, Justin. I won't let you down. I know you won't. Studying. Right now. Finals in six weeks. I'll call back. Talk then. Good night... Justin. As I was Saying. My parents support and encourage my journey of the soul. I'm pretty sure your soul doesn't reside in your pants. Since that is the only part of you that has had any journey. I can't help it if I'm irresistable. Well, you and your sould need to get out of here so I can study and you can go find yourself. No soul finders tonight. And I don't feel like flying solo. Aww. Did you finally develop carpel tunel. I warned you. I know. And I appriciate all the times you tried to step in as a pinch hitter. But your grip on the bat... Not so good for a home run slugger. Asshole. Get out of here. By your command. My fellow countrymen. Shut up Justin. It is with great regret and a heavy heart I must inform you that I will travel to a far away place tonight to satisfy my... soul. Do it already! A place where only those with the highest of intelect! Questionable. Superior Looks! Now I now your talking about me! And an unwavering thirst, to find the human soul! Or, a descent piece of ass. Or a descent piece of ass. Thank you Sire, Tobin. And so, I travel to the great unknown. Jump already and put us out of our misery. What a world. What a cruel, cruel, cruel world. I added that third cruel to avoid plagerism. How thoughtful. Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! The people have spoken Sire Tobin. I must take my leave of you now. Sire Tobin! I do believe I will be needing the services of your noble steed this night. Are you shitting me? I am most definately not shitting you sir. I do feel the pain of a thousand seering suns burning my leg but good. Goddammit, Shit. You know, this is why freshman year lotteries for roommates is a bad idea. Your college experience would have been so dull wihtout me. Stay there. I'll be right down. Where would I go? Asshole! Justin OK, so I don't write everything down. Sometimes I just out of a window. Justin Sometimes I laugh when I should cry. Justin like Heilein says, "We laugh because it's the only thing that will keep it from hurting" Well, that and pain killers. Mr Johnson. You seem to have had an accident. Justin. And who are you, Michael, RN? You Must be new? No, I'm not new. I just drew the short straw. Cute and cleaver. What a rare combination. So what happened, Mr Johnson? Mr. Johnson is my father's name. I think I'm a little young to be a Mister anybody, don't you? You can call me Justin. I think we're pretty much the same age. We're the exact same age actually. What happened? Apparently they don't make tree limbs like they used to. Justin. Wait. If were the same age, how do you get to be a nurse? Doesn't that take like 12 years of college? or something? Are you Doogie Howser? Apparently you missed the common sense portion of the tree limb surfing class. Doogie Howser is a fictional teenage doctor. I'm a real life nurse. Skipped high school. Went to college at sixteen. graduated when I was 20. Wow, that's impressive. I didn't even know you could do that. So, you jumped out of a window? Into a tree. And the limb broke. Are you in any pain? Just right here. You're having chest pain? My heart stops when you look at me. Did you just quote a Lady Gaga song to me? Katy Perry, dude. How do you not know that? You say that like she's Judy Gardland. Are you having any leg pain? Nice deflection Michael, RN. Justin. I took some T3 on the way over... So, I guess I'm like a six on the pain scale. Should I be impressed or worried about your knowledge of our pain scale? Or the fact that you have T3 in stock. I just seem to be accident prone. Is that what we're calling it now? I just miss you all so much. Tough way to get friends. I just figure it's easier than actually sending letters home. Nothing says I Love you to the parentals, like a new Explaination of Benefits and an ER bill, right? Mom gets confirmation of my wereabouts and dad gets assurance that I'm just being a guy and not a gay. Justin. Mr. Johnson. They can bring you into this world but they sure don't have to love you. I'm..sorry. Gonna take you to Xray, make sure you don't have a break. Another adventure. Another ER bill. Double the love coming their way. You're welcome mom and dad! There's no way Or Maybe he tried and it's still stuck up there. That explains the constipated personality traits. Ok, Screw you all. I'm gonna get another drink. My God, look who it is. Where? Over by the piano. Aw, Shit. It's the nurse from the ER. There are a lot of nurses in an ER, Mark. I bet your medical record is a few encyclopedias deep. He's probably got a picture on a poster in the med room that says, "Beware of horny gay man!" You know what. I'll have you all know, I am not that desperate. Most of the time I'm not that desperate. He's just particularly cute. Ok, and which ER visit is this one from? Jumped! So cute! and he plays piano! Boom! See this is why we can't play poker. You've got no game face. Man up. Whatever. You're already more man than the rest of us B. Damn Right! No, you want this one. Come on! Nurse, Justin. Shut up. Michael, RN You remembered my name. I'm just really good with names is all. Surprising, considering faces don't seem to be your primary focus. Do you take requests? Do you tip? I might. Then I might take a request. It will be my final song of the night. I wanna hear something that's gonnna get my body moving and show off my sexy dance moves. K I have a request for you all from... My God, Justin! My God Justin! He wishes to move his body for you all! "You put your right hand in, you put your right hand out." Aww. Come on everybody. He's gone shy - help him out. You put your right hand in and you shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around. That's what it's all about. You do the Hooookey Pokey. You do the Ho-oy-oy-o-key Pokey Come on Michael, RN - Big finish! That's what it's all about! Crowd claps Justin: Thank you. Thank you so much. Well played Michael, RN. You know, I still don't know your last name. No. No you don't. Does that mean I have to beg? I'd rather not have to watch. So you will tell me your last name. No. They how am I going to track you down? Are you the stalker type? No. Just the interested type. You're not my type. What's not your type? My personality? Thanks, Brian. See you in a couple of weeks. My Face? My what? Look Justin. You're funny and kind of cute. But.. But. This is not something I need in my life. This. You're a hot mess. I am hot. I'll give you that. I'm not into one night stands. Neither am I. I wasn't planning on sleeping over. Good bye Michael, RN. Till our paths cross again. Place your bets girls. And Brooke. Thanks for clarifying, I am all woman. Boys, where's the chocolate? Is somebody on their... Brooke. Todd, Please. Use your overrated college vocabulary to explain to me... ...Why my needs, during my menstral cycle, are open to your male privledged opinion. I will have you know, I am currently experiencing contractions which are cutting off the oxygen to my uterus. So if I need some chocolate to increase my seratonin levals. Rather than, I don't know, stabbing the nearest male in the room to relieve physical pain. I'd say your coming out on top. So you had better fork over the chocolate, I know you are hiding. And then call your mothers to say thank you. Thank you for the years of periods you endured and suffered through, just so I may have life. That's what I thought. It helped Harry Potter when he was facing the dementors. I don't think so... No uterous, No opinion. Chocolate! Yeah! Drink up suckers! That had better be the damn pizza. I'm wasting away. Only the brain cells you don't feed. - Thank God. - Change? No, It's cool. What took you so long? We're have open mic night at the bar. All those singers and wanna be comedians. Is there a piano player? Tall, Blonde hair... got the pectoral muscles. Looks like he might be a really good hugger. You mean Michael. Yeah. Yeah! Yeah.. It's cool.. Michael..Michael..Mr Michael.. It's cool... It's cool. Umm..Do, um, is that getting over soon... or..um are people maybe..or is there like? - ...is there like time to go... - Last calls midnight. Cool. thanks, dude. So, I think I'm gonna make a run and get some more beers. Beers in the fridge. Then I'm gonna get us some hotwings. He's just after that nurse from the bar. Are you just hungry for another rejection? Come on Justin. I am nothing, if not persistant. He will sucumb to my charms. Actually, He's just trying to make him cum. Ovaries! Haa. Drink up boys. Come to mama, chocolate heaven bliss. Who made up this game? it's stupid. You! Round two. Bets in boys. I'm out. I've gotta go find my prince charming before the stroke of midnight. Aww. Your mama's would be proud. Hey, Michael, RN. Hey... Justin... You remembered my name. Of course. It's what I call the demons in my dreams. I'm in your dreams? It's like we've already had our first date. I hardly qualfy you chasing me with long sharp objects a date. I guess that depends on your idea of fun. Wait. when you said deamon - Did you mean like dementor type deamon, or like nightmare on elm street. Dementor Justin: Yes! Michael, RN! what do I have to do to get you to go on a date with me? Besides a personality labotomy? Tried that. Didn't take. Why is everything a joke with you? Why is everything NOT a joke with you? - Ok, fine. - Is that a yes? No. You asked what you have to do. Since it appears you are a Harry Potter fan. Let's go with the Tri-wizard Tournament theme. Michael, RN! I am impressed. And strangely turned on. You're gonna make me regreat this, aren't you? Complete three tasks and a date you shall have. Don't complete the tasks, no date. - Woah. Shit just got real. - That's right. - Ok. Do you have a pen? - Yeah. I'ts ok grandma, you will only feel a little sting. I don't believe in all this vacination nonsense... Ready? Sorry. I'm with you. right here. Lay it on me Michael, RN. I want to defy gravity. Defy Gravity? Do you need me to spell that for you? As in "Wicked" the musical? So, you know the show. Yeah, I've seen it like ten times. It's true. Yeah? Yeah! Liar. No. I.. Yeah!? "So nobody in all of oz..." Ok. ...Ok! Justin:... that there is or was..." Ok! ..."Is ever gonna bring..." Michael: Ok - I believe you! stop singing! Please stop singing! Sorry Justin: She loved it. Dearest Mumsy and Popsicle, Always willilng to support what I will call... fieldtrips. All in the name of furthering my education. Field trips? In college? Michael, RN. I will do anything to go on a date with you. Make me defy gravity. Ok. Get some good sleep - for gravity defying later. Defy gravity. It's just-gravity... Shit! Michael, Michael motercycle. How can I make you fly? As it turned out, as with most casses in my college life. Brooke's feminine intuition was the missing link to solve this puzzle. With her help and an introduction to an acquaintance of hers I was ready to win over Michael, RN's heart. Or fall flat on my face in the attempt. What are you doing here? Since my knowledge of you is limited to where you work and what you drive - I had to improvise. I may have driven through the lot a few times this week looking for your car. But, now that I have found you. It is time! Excuse me? Task number one. It is time. Time for what? To defy gravity. I'm not getting in a car with you. Fine. Be difficult. Will you follow me? Justin I... Please. Ok. But make it quick. I'm back here early. Where are we? Where defying gravity is possible. Justin. If this.. Michael. I assure you, I only wish to complete my first task. Trust me. Trust is earned, Justin. Hey Justin. You finally found him. Yeah. Cool. Let's do this. Do what? For someone so smart, you really are slow sometimes. Michael, RN this is Dave. Dave this is Michael, RN. Just Michael is fine. You need to put these on. What is this? That's your defying gravity gear. You're gonna fly today! For real? For real! Um, give me everything in your pockets. I know, I know. Trust is earned. Whatever. You won't regreat it. I'm already regreating it. Music and sounds of flight chamber turning on. Well, this is new. I'm doing something for somebody else. Justin Not just so that the look on their face will trigger a dopamine rush in my brain. But I mean, the look on his face is pretty great! I'm looking at someone who trusts the air to hold him up Trust isn't light as air. Trust is a burden that you place into the hands of the people you give it. Some of them drop it. Maybe, some of them don't. That was amazing! That was amazing. I used to dream about doing stuff like that as a kid. Justin. Yeah, Brooke said you would love it. Who's Brooke? She's a friend from college. She actually hooked this up when I told her about my first task. So you needed help completing the task? Harry needed help from Hermione and Ron. Harry was fighting Mermaids, Dragons and Dark Lords. Ok .Well... I'm new at this, Michael, RN. Garner. What? Garner. My last name. Stop with the RN thing - ok. Garner. Gaarnner. Nope - I liked RN better. What? Just kidding. It's not like you can control your last name. So, What's my second task Michael Garner. Justin, I... What? No. Lay it on me. It seems kind of cruel now. I didn't think you'd complete the first one. So you've been thinking about me. A purple ghost orchid. That's not a real thing. That's a real thing? Very real. OK. Challenge accepted. How do I get a hold of you? You don't. I'll meet you at the bar. Friday night - I'm playing. Friday night then. 48hours. Yeah. Unless you can't handle it. - Of course I can handle it. - Well, I can handle it. You got this. I got this. Right. - Yeah. Yeah. - Cool. Till then Justin Johnson. Till then Michael Garner. What the hell's a ghost orchid? It's one of the rarest flowers in the world. Found primarily in Cuba. It was extinct for over 20 years. And it's.. Kind of creepy. How does somebody even know about stuff like this? What is with this guy, Justin? I've never seen you like this before. I don't know. He's just... different. Well take it easy, Ok? I've never seen this side of you before. And I might actually fall for you myself. Brooke. I just learned that you masculine demeanor doesn't come with the right accessories. Asshole. Thanks for the assist. Get out of here before someone actually thinks you're studying. You're gonna confuse the commoners. Love you. Dito. Do you have a rockstar? Go fish. Do you have the octopus? Do you have the octopus? Justin! Do you have the octopus? I... do. Good fishing. What else you got? Everyone, this is Michael. Michael this is everyonel. Honest to God you moron. HI. I'm Brooke. As in, arranged the flying lesson, Brooke? One in the same. Thank you so much. That was amazing. Alright, I like him, he can stay. - I'm Mark. - Mark. - Hey, I'm Ben. - Ben. Pleasure to meet you all. Wow Justin. Polite and cute. You were right about this one. Shut up now please. I'll walk you to your car. Your friends seem nice. Yeah. I can't complain. So, I never asked. What are you studying? Life. Sorry? I'm studying life. I've never heard of that major. It's because it only exists for indecisive loosers like me. Ok. Disapointed? Nope. No judgement here. Come here. I wanna show you something. Close your eyes. Why? You gonna kid nap me? Yeah. You foiled all my plans Michael. No. I just don't want you to ruin all my hard work and spoil the surprise. So..Trust me. Your need for trust. K. Open your eyes. What is that? It's a..ghost. Michael honestly you have a college degree. I said Ghost Orchid. No. You said, Purple ghost orchid. How? I am incredibly crafty. Wow, this is just... Wow. So, Michael Garner, would you agree that I have completed the second task required to take you on a proper date. Look... Justin. You don't have to.. I'm gonna see this through, Michael I take it seriously. I'm not gonna let you leave until you give me my final task. It can't be done, Justin. That's the point. The seven wonders of the world. I want to see them. Wow. You really know how to squash a guys dreams. Truly Justin. You don't have to do this. I'm impressed, I'm flatered and.. I'm practically speechless. Yes, I will go on a date with you. No... No?! I..mean... Yes. But not until I complete my third task. I gott go..check on something. I'll text you later. Justin! Don't you need my number? I'll already got it, dude. Wait - excuse me? While you were defying gravity. I called my phone from your phone. I've just been waiting for your permission to use it. It's all about trust, Michael. I'll talk to you soon. Justin Johnson. Yes sir, Of course sir. Wouldn't dream of it, sir. As always sir, without fail. Very grateful, sir. You also, Sir. Good night, Father. Hey. Hi. You're um, humble chariot awaits. Humble chariot? My other horses were being stabled... so, you know I had to... Just work with me here, Michael. Ok..show me to thine chariot good sir. Sorry. That just sounded so gay coming from you. Are you playing the pot or the kettle? Ok. A little sassy. I'm not sure if I'm gonna add that to the positives or the negatives list. After you. We have to drive a little bit out for this one. Do you trust me? I willingly got in the car, didn't I? Progress. Just as long as you promise to drop a line to my parents, telling them where to find the body. Michael what kind of monster do you think I am? Of course I'll drop a line to your parents. Hey. We're almost there. So... I need you to close your eyes. What? Michael, Relax. If I was gonna do something crazy, I would have stopped at that field ten minutes ago, where they have an enclosed area and some really soft dirt. Remind me again why I got in this car? Whoa, look out. Just kidding. you're fine. I've got you. You didn't open your eyes.. Ok We're almost there. Alright. Open your eyes. Welcome, to the wonders of the world. This is a miniature golf course, Justin. No, it's not Michael. This is my tri-wizard victory. Really? I don't think the statue of liberty ever made the natural wonders list. Ok, Well, as long as we're keeping score. There are 77 different natural wonders from 11 different lists. As well as eleven individual countries each with their own seven wonders inside of them. So that's like 154 wonders of the world. Yeah, I did my research. Well... Here. With a little imagination. You'll see, we have the Roman Coliseum. Mhhmm.. The Great Wall of China. Right over there. I see it. And. Over here we have The Leaning Tower of Pisa.. Obviously Obviously. Minarets of, um, Mantach. And then, the Panama Canal. And this is, clearly Stonehenge Clearly... Exactly. Thank you for going with it, Michael. No, no, no. Please. I brought you here my friend. Today I am inviting you to sally forth. And experience the wonder. You are beyond ridiculous. I'm hoping that's a good thing. It's not a bad thing. Don't feel bad. Everybodies really bad at this game when they first play. Let me show you how it's done. You ok? - I'm fine. I was in your way. I was just warming up. - My bad! That'll do. Thanks. You actually get extra points when you go in the water. Ok. Perfect. Yeah! - Hey! - What? It's no good Justin: Nope. Don't be cheating. What are you... No, you're good. I was just fixing up the score. We're all set now. Liar. Hey, hey.. Ok. I'm coming down. Don't fall. How about that. Don't - don't fall. Until just now I hadn't even... thank you! Laughing I don't know where it went. I think it's gone. Give me that. - Jerk. - You're a jerk. At some point she's going to get it. Careful, Careful. I got this. Yeah, I know. I just feel like it's very easy to fall. For you? ...Yeah. How're we doing? Right, so I'm obviously ahead of you. I don't know. you have way less points that me, dude. I am like soaring. I'm just gonna... I'll wait. Take your time. Are you good? I give. Check it out. I tought him how to do a trick. Hang on he's really good at it. Justin Dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, da. Come on. Why, I ought ta... Ok you win. You win. Wait, I win? I should do more cardio. I'll give that to you. Thanks. Cute. Not as a date or anything, but I'm ridculously hungry. They have these really great hot dogs here. I could go for a hot dog. Cool. So, why is this not a date? You'll know when I take you on a date. Duly noted. Can I ask what you plan to do after college? After? You mean I actually have to leave? Why is your wall so high? Spent a lot of time building this wall. And, the view is lovely from my side. I'll have you know. So what you're saying is you might invite me in. Would you come in if I did? I might enjoy the view as well. Then I might consider an invitation. But it's a mess right now and I'll need some time to tidyd up. Can we have two. I can wait. Good to know. Both. Thanks. You're never going to be able to eat another hot dog for the rest of your life. So. Why nursing? There was a time when I. I needed a lot of medical attention The way they made me feel safe. Taken care of. I knew that was something I wanted to do for others. Can I - ask what happened? You can ask. Some day I might tell you. We all have walls, Justin. They have my favorite ride. Come on, let's go do it. I dont' know Justin. I've got this inner ear thing. Inner..what? Come on let's go! You're gonna love it. It's so much fun. Come on. You're gonna love it. Over here. These are... yeah. Safety. You're gonna be fine. Do I need a hard helmet? It isn't that bad. But then it goes sideways. - Great. - It goes sideways? - It's gonna go a little faster. - My God. OOHH - You ok Michael? - Yeah... I don't know Justin. Faster! Come on! What is this? The tea cups? Let's do it! Is it over? No. It's just getting started. God. We're going full tilt. FULL TILT! You love rides like this? I love this. My eyes are shut. No! You've got to open your eyes. No, you've got to close them. You're looking straight up. Then straight down. Then straight up I'm starting to feel it. Are you going to throw up? No.. Are you sure you're not gonna thow up? This is the hard part. All the blood is going to rush away from your brain. Just go with it. Maybe no more rides. You OK, Michael? You ok, Mike? Michael! Michael Shit. I'm sorry dude. Umm. Do you need.. God. thank you! Here, I got you a napkin. Michael? Just take me home, Justin. Ok! Yeah! I can do that! No problem. Just go real slow. I got you. Just come over and sit down. Here we go. What um, what do you need? What can I do? You're still here. Of course. You're easier to take advantage of while your asleep. Should I be worried? Not untili the pictures finish uploading. Or the bruises start showing. Dope. I'm definitely adding that to my list of positives. You were looking very focused on what you were writing there. It's just random thoughts, and quotes and stupid junk. Care to share? People build walls not to keep others out. But to see who's willing to break them down. I like you like this. I like me like this too. Stay for dinner? Did..you just ask me on our first date? If you consider a dinner consisting of bread and soup a date. I don't know. I'll have to check my calendar. Will you stay? As long as you'll have me. Hey, Brooke. Right on time. What? Sit with me, Michael. Actually, I'm here to pick up Justin. Justin was in a fight. What. Please sit down, Michael. You're kind of freaking me out. Where's Justin? Mark took him to the ER. I'm gonna... No. He doesn't want you there. Why? There are two things in Justin's life that he has come to count on. First being that you are always five minutes early for your dates. And second, that his father will call him twice every quarter. Wait, what does this have to do with him getting in a fight? What does he wan't from his father? Same thing we all do, I suppose. His ER visits typically follow that phone call. You meet him on one of those days. So, he got in a fight with his dad. No. That's not a fight he's ready for. This time it was the wall that took the brunt of it. Score one for the wall. Mark texted about a half an hour ago. The X-ray showed no broken bones. So they'll be back soon. I was told to keep you company until then. You're a good friend, Brooke. I know. He needs good friends. But he also needs a lot of things I can't give him. I care about him. I know you do. So how do I get him to open up? Just be there for him, when he's ready. And don't forget about my party next Friday. I expect to see you both there. Promise. So what's the plan for break now that finals are over? I told the parentals that I had to stay here a little longer to get a head start on next term. I'll fly back a few days after Christmas to avoid the rush. And what did Michael say about the recent wall incident? I've managed to mostly avoid the topic. He's not ready to carry my bagage yet. Well at least give him the option to decline. Instead of just assuming he wouldn't want to. Withholding information can never lead to good things, Justin. Well, I'm breaking it to him slowly then. I'ts been almost two months. Yeah, exactly. Two months. He's not ready for that yet. I think I just contracted diabetes watching that. Am I sensing a midnight Cinderella disaperance? We agreed to leave at midnight so he could take me to the coast for the weekend. OOHHH. Relax hormonal one. We haven't even done that yet. Yeah right. No - Seriously? Damn, Justin. I'm impressed. I might actually cry. My boy is growing up. Shut up. I'ts time good sir to make our depature. Thank you, Brooke, For inviting us to your fare castle But now we must make our leave to a land far, far away. Scary how well matched you two are. Ignore her. she's just jealous. Drive safely. I love you. Dito. The Pacific Ocean is deafening. Like an airplane taking off. Like windows down on a high way. Like..Silence. I'm not good in silence. I like talking, or shouting or anything that will be distracting. When we drown out the noise of all our insecurities. Will we finally have to confront ourselves? Like Atreyu at the Southern Oracle. Michael: Maybe I could do that. Maybe I could be brave with someone like him by my side. Or maybe on my own. But having him here doesn't hurt. He's my luck dragon. Good morning Morning. You been awake a long time? About an hour. You're writing something there. I felt insprired. I've neve woken up next to somebody without, you know, Being hung over or preparing to take the glorious walk of shame. Michael You make small noises when you sleep. Aw, you're making that up. Believe what you want, sir. But I just wrote a sonnet about it. Ode to a snore. I do not snore! Ok, that must have been the other guy I was sleeping next to last night. Must have been. Let me see it. - Let me see it. - Yeah. Ok, Ok. You win. Really?! A cross between a chainsaw and a dinosour with a sinus cold. You should be careful what you ask for. - Wow. What is this? For you. Did I forget an important date or something already? No, of course not. I just saw this and thought of you. Open it. Come on. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. I know sometimes words don't come easily for you But I know writting does. It's got me through some tough times. Such as. I told you I skipped high school. It wasn't because I wanted to. I wanted what every teenager wanted Football games, dances a good looking photo in the yearbook. It wasn't meant to be. There was a time I trusted too easily. It almost cost me everything. His name was Brian. He moved to our city at the start of seventh grade. Popular instantly. Liked by everyone. He picked me first in kickball. We became immediate friends. One night, he and I were out on the field talking about... God knows what. It was getting late. So we decided to leave. He grabbed my hand and before I could process what was happening He kissed me. Every nerve in my body felt so alive. Never thought I'd actually find... someone. Before I could say it outloud. I heard this banging and yelling. I turned to find the resident bullies walking toward us. They were throwing around the typical gay and homo slurs. So, I grabbed Brian's hand and tried to run away. He pulled his hand out and said, "What are you doing? Why'd you kiss me?" Then he turned to the bullies and said, "Hey, this gay punk just kissed me against my will." So two of em' grabbed me and pinned me to the ground The other started to kick and hit me over and over and... Once he had his fun. He turned to Brian and said, "Your turn." Show this punk how we feel about homos. I blacked out. The next thing I remembered was waking up in the ICU. After I left the hospital. My parents thought it would be best To homeschool me through the rest of middle school. After that it was my choice. High school or college. And the rest is, as you say, history. Michael, I'm..so sorry. Don't be. It was a long time ago. Thank you. Thank you, for not pushing, not grilling, for being patient. For sharing. Just promise me, you'll use these hands for writing it out. And not taking it out on inanimate objects that keep whooping your ass. Hey, I don't know, I've gotten in some pretty good sneak attacks. Yeah, keep telling yourself that. Come on. Let's go down to the beach. Justin? About time, I'm starving. What is this? Come on in. I built a fort. Exactly when did I start dating a toddler? Exactly when did I start dating an old man? What did you get? - You're fav. - My fav? Glass noodle? Yeah! Thanks. You're welcome. No. Thanks. How do you do that? What? I've been naked in front of more men than I can remember. Ok, I really don't need to hear... But I've never felt more exposed than when you look into my eyes. The stirring of a soul. What? The eyes are the windows to the soul. When peering in you can see it move. Often it will hide. Afraid, alone wrongly judged, shamed into a corner. When it knows that it's loved. Without reserve or condition. It accepts itself. And shines from within the eyes once again. Where did you learn that? I wrote it. Really? I told you. I had a lot of stuff to work out for myself once too. It's beautiful. Wait. Did you just say you loved me? Yeah. Yes I did. I love you. Dito. Dito? Michael, this isn't easy for me. I'm Hey.. Shit. Ok... Just. Fuck it. Michael. I assure you my intentions here were copletely honorable. Well not completely honorable. Because I would totally take advantage of you. But, it wasn't my intention to seduce you with my mad fort building skills. Michael: So..If you're not ready to do this. Did it ever occur to you, that I was planning on seducing you. Whaa. I will have you know that I am not some kind of fluzzy. But I am incorrigible. So can we just.. I would be honored to take advantage in anyway possible. Just get over here. Justin? - Hey. - Hey. What're you doing? Just enjoying the breeze. And, keeping a promise. My favorite getaway. Close your eyes. Now? Ok. Ok Listen to the sound of the crashing waves. Feel your body drift into another dimmension. You're adorable. And poetic. You do the same. I guess. You could you know. Write. Stories and such. I don't think so. My dad... I don't think so. I don't think your dad has come to realize that there is so much more to you than what he wants. He realizes it. He's just only interested in removing the parts that keep me from becoming the perfect son. You astonish me how you breeze through your classes with hardly a care. And still manage to maintain the grade point average you have. I had to work so hard to get through college. and the nursing program. You. Little to no effort. It's people like you who piss the rest of us off. Hey, I can't help it if I'm naturally brilliant. - Yeah.. Do you realize if you applied yourself. Like, actually applied yourself to something. Like writing, for instance. How good you would be? I know. I just... I just don't want to make the other people in my graduating class feel badly about themselves. So, I have to contain my genius You know, I can't have my parental units thinking I'm actually going to make something of my life. Yes. The field trip paying, ER bill supporting parents. They are the reason I exist. Or at least that's what they tell me. You kow, I don't really have any memories of the inception. I'm not pushing, Justin. But just know that you can tell me anything. I know. I love you. Dito. Can we stay here? All I'm saying is.. Shh. I just need to complete this thought. There. What were you saying? All I'm saying, is you can't draw a fair comparison of the two. Valentine's Day is just another excuse for oversensationalized consumerism. Way to kill the romantic vibe. Not.. kill, Michael. But tame. I mean. Being romantic shouldn't be limited to only one day per year. It's only limited if you rely it that way. Otherwise, it's just a fun way to show someone they matter. Well, I would never rely on a twenty four hour excuse for a holiday to be romantic. But, I also wouldn't be the idiot who refused to take advantage Of an opportunity to let someone know they mattered. Jerk! Not the response I was hoping for. After that debate. And here I made you this nice lunch and got you something. You got me something? what is it? Let me see it, let me see it, let me.. No. I don't want to show you now. Please. No. You'll just have to wait until after Brooke's party. After?! Are you serious? Very. I have to get dressed. Thank you for the rose. Fine. I'll just sit here and work on my assignement. And try not to be disillusioned about the extent to which I matter, to someone. On Valentines Day. I assure you. It will be worth the wait. You can't just do that. You know what it does to me. I know. Believe me I know. Is that the new schedule for spring? Yep. It's time to set forth a course of educational goals for another quarter. Interesting choices. So what is the goal here, Justin? To avoid adult life as long as possible. You mean, as long as your dad has an open checkbook. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Just..Let's just get ready. You know what, No! You don't just get to say something like that to me. and then walk away with a, nothing It just seems like maybe you'd be ready to actually, I don't know, do something. Take a little responsibility. Be responsible. I have been nothing but the model son for that so proud father of mine. Look, I know this is a touchy subject for you. No, you kow what. You get to be a lot of things to me, Michael. But you do NOT get to judge me. I am not judging you. Really?! I.. You know what? Were gonna put this on pause. Pause? A pause, Justin. It means were gonna stop for now and get ready for the party that you promised we would help set up. I am not going to do this out in a hurried manner. It's too damned important. Fine. Pause. (Dramatic music. Unpause? Is that breaking a rule? My father has had my life in a vice since he learned about my gay... tendencies. I opened my journal to you. I tried to let you look inside. And believe me when I tell you, that wasn't easy. That man goes out of his way to remind me of his rules and expectations. Twice a quarter. Like every other loving father. I may not qualify to be his pride and joy. But I have earned every penny I get. Whether he knows it or not. I am collecting on a debt. That he owes me! Pause! Unpause? I am sorry, Justin. I'm sorry that life has handed you a fate that will forever subject you to being judged. I'm sorry we live in a world where being gay either means you are the side show freak Or the cute puppy in the window. We deserve better than to live our lives as some type of public display. We may not be able to control how we are treated. But we do have the ability to change..how we treat ourselves. At some point, regardless of the wrongs put upon you. The only person that owes you anything. Is you. Pause. I can see you have something to say, Justin. Just unpause. No. You know what? You don't get to be a condescending asshole, OK! And you don't get to decide who owes me what! This is not your life and you don't understand! Cause you won't let me understand, Justin. Maybe I have a good reason for that, Michael. And, yet.. No! No And Yet OK! It's not up to you! Michael: Justin. - I am doing the best I can right now. Justin. - And I don't need you judging me for it. No! Just no! I can't be what you expect right now. Maybe you need to decide if you can accept that. I'm gonna go help Brooke. Pause! Alright, Spill it. Sorry? Cut the innocent act, Mister and spill. What did you do? What makes you think I did something? Well considering the fact that your man looks just as miserable as you do I'm going to guess you two are fighting. And chances are good that you could resolve it. Well. For your information. We are not technically, as of this moment, fighting Because, we're on a pause. Pause? OK, you are making this party A serious downer. You need to get your ass out there and fix things! He loves you! And I know you love him - even if you can't say the words. He is the best thing to come your way since you moved here. Hey..since it's valentines day I'd like to sing a song for someone very special in my life. I can only hope that you will stay. Let me look again in to your eyes. Cause our love is gonna cover up the fights. And this day will serve us well as life arrives. Without you, life would be too much. It's the simple things. And the way you trust. All I want is to see the light of your loving arms in mine. Alright! - Awww. Can we unpause? Justin, I.. Michael, Thank you. That was beautiful. I'm sorry. Why are you appologizing to me? Because I shouldn't push you. Everyone has to find their own way. And it's not fair to push my agenda onto your life. I don't know what my agenda is. I just know I want to be on yours. You are the best part of my agenda, Justin. - Would I eat space food? - On mars. What? - Would I? - Maybe on Saturn. No! - Am I unicorn? Yeah! - Yeah! Drink, Drink up! Alright, that's it! I know you two are cheating. What? I am wounded. I am Truly deeply hurt by your accusation. - Yeah. I think she may be right. You two are highly suspect. Don't give me the puppy dog eye look, misters. Crap. I need to all my parents. I forgot that this next weekend is parents weekend. Man, Parents weekend. What a nightmare that was. - Tell me about it. Are your parents coming? You're talking about my parents, right? - I just thought... No. They will not be joining us. I'm actually going to go see them this weekend. Apparently it is time for another family meeting. Next weekend? I thought that we were... - Just for 24hours - I promise. And then I'm yours for all of spring break to do whatever you wish with. And then I'm yours, for all of spring break, to do whatever you wish with. Woah! Hey! Excuse me! Are we gonna get back to playing the game or what?! Yes! Definitely. - Next round, inanimate objects. - I'm watching you two. - Ooo, She's watching us. - No, what are we gonna do? We can't do anything while she's watching. Justin Johnson. I'm sorry. It's his dad.- . He sucks. Hey. Hi. So, that was the father. Yeah. You ok? I wish. It's never simple is it? It doesn't have to be as hard as he makes it. Agreed. I wish I didn't.. I know. Then why... Because he's your dad. Who doesn't want their dad to support them? Come on. Let's go whoop their butts with these inanimate objects. Ok. Yeah? Take out for Michael Garner. Justin? Michael! Hey. Are..these your parents? Um. Yeah. Greg and Cynthia Johnson. This is Michael Garner. He's a friend. Michael, are you going to univeristy as well? Actually... Yeah, he's in the engineering program. Unusual uniform for an engineering student. Are you working tonight? Yeah. My friend cancelled our plans. So I picked up an extra shift. Justin could never hack it in a program as complicated as engineering. Something like that. You know I've paid so many bills to that ER. I could fund it for a century. Well he does seem accident prone. Well, It was a pleasure to meet you both. I really should get to work. Got to pay those tuition bills. We're going to be a big group project as soon as spring term starts. I'll be right back. Michael. Michael, wait. What do you want, Justin? Please, let me explain. Explain what? The lie? Or the lie to cover-up the lie? Or the fact that you're ashamed of me and what I do? The everything you said in there was complete and utter bullshit! Michael, I swear I'm not ashamed of you. And, I haven't lied to you. Not about anything important. Good to know I am not a violent person, Justin. But I swear to God, if you do that again. Justin! Please. Please. There is an explaination. What I think, is that you're a lying, hiding, scared little kid. And I don't date liars or kids, ok?! NO! You don't understand. I was trying to protect you. I am not a child, Justin. I don't require your protection. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you that my parents were going to be here. I didn't know how to... You didn't? Please! You run that mouth a million miles a minute and somehow, this..didn't come up? How was I supposed to work this into a normal conversaton? I knew that if I said anything about you being a nurse, that I would have to sit there and listen to that man Talk about you and judge you. And I wasn't going to let that happen. I wasn't going to let..those people.. Hurt someone I love. Wha'd you say? I'm so proud of you, Michael. And what you do. And to be with you. No. You said, you weren't about to let them hurt.. Someone I love. I love you, Goddamnit! And I'm not gonna let you walk away, just because that son of a bitch! Hey. I love you too. I have to go back inside before they come out. We'll talk tomorrow. If I open this - are you gonna shut it again? I'll let you go. Just for tonight. Trauma, room 12. WW Medical out. Susan. Code three on the way.

Thank you. deep exhale deep breath dis-believing sigh deep breathing, sniffling Brooke? He's much more stable. They'll see how the pneumonia is responding to the antibiotics. We;re monitoring the labs to check the liver and kidney functions. And if those look good, we can get him off the respirator within the next 24 hours. - Do you have any questions? - No. Let me know if you need anything. - Just a few more minutes, Michael. - Thank you, Chris. Mr and Mrs Johnson..I'm..Michael.. We know who you are and what you are to Justin. How? My wife saw you with him. The display you put on in the parking lot In public. We only came back here to check on him before we head back home. You're leaving? Yeah, of course. He'll be fine. Yes, I think he will but he needs you. Please stay Nonsense! He told me last night, that he dosen't need me. I told him to call me when he's ready to make the right choices. The right choices? Or your choices. Let's go. Please. Don't turn your back on him. You're the last person I want to talk to about my ss..Justin. Your SON, wants you in his life. What makes you think you know what he wants? Because I love him. I told him last night. You and your kind. You don't understand love. How could you? It's unnatural. He has to choose. You're life style. Or mine. What kind of life is that, exactly? Being gay is not a choice, Mr Johnson. Do you honestly think someone would choose a life where they are subjected to hatred and prejiduce? Please Greg, Let's go. We don't want to be late. No, please. Don't be late. Just because your son... My, Justin will be fine. and then he will come home. And he will live the lifestyle he's supposed to live. He can't do any of this without me. Actually, I believe he can achieve more without you holding him down. He is one of the smartest, most articulate, incredibly brave, strong and loving men I have ever met. And all he asks, wants from you, is to accept him and love him for who he is. All he is. All, as you put it. Is not what he should be. According to you. According to society Mr, Garner. That is changing, Mr. Johnson. He has two options, Mr Garner. You're way - or mine. I think, Mr Johnson. He will choose his own way. Then that will be his loss. Cynthia. No! Mr and Mrs Johnson. I am most certain the loss will be yours. Michael. I am not an invaid. I can do things for myself. You're body being weak does not mean you are weak, OK. Hey. Hey, J. You look good man. Thanks. You ever pull that shit again and so help me. I won't. Better not. - Uuhh. - Dude. I'm so Sorry. I won't. I promise. Damn right you do. I'm so sorry. You are loved, you know? Yeah, I know. And we will get through this, together. We? Well of course. There is way too much testrosterone driving this ship, ok? Mama's got the love and the estrogen. I love you both. We love you too. So, what happens now? I don't know. I'm gonna stay here with Michael for a little while. And we'll see. Let's move this to livingroom You really should be resting. - Michael. - Justin. He's right. So get your butt on that couch, Justin Johnson. Ok. Ok. Here's to the end of a successful junior year, and a senior year we'll never forget. Here, here! So, what is the plan? Will you be joining us? Not as a senior, at least not at first. But it should only take me a couple of terms to catch up. Are you saying you're actually going to get a degree in something? Sire Tobin, you wound me Creative writing. Who knew right? My God, I can actually see that. Congrats man, I'm glad things are looking up. Thanks. It's not everything I hoped and dreamed it would be. But, actually, it's better. And, I get to wake up to his beautiful face in the morning, instead of your ugly mug. What he means, is he finally found a way to bring the ER to him. Yeah. Good thing. Without the parents financial support, no more trips to the ER. Does that include school expenses? they, cut me off. But, I've applied for financial aid, grants and scholarships. I should Be able to get out of school without too much debt. If I stick to a budget I'm sorry. I thought you were Justin Johnson? Have you see him? He saved my life. He. He told us about that night. Yeah, I mean, that too. But.. I'm just not the same Justin Johnson I used to be. I mean obviously it's still me. With him, everything else is different. I just hope I can do as much for him one day. You do, Justin. You have. It's time. It's time. OK. So, Ill just..go do this. Hey. Hey. Do you, umm, Do you take requests? Do you, tip? I might. Then I might take request. Ok. But, Umm I'm on kind of a budget these days. So... Well, since you're kind of cute. What'll it be? My request is simple. I just need you to, umm, rise.. up. Get up. Rise up off the piano bench OK. Just go sit with our friends, ok. Hey. Hey everybody. This is um, this is going to be a little Different than what you're used to. This one's for you, Michael. Once there was a time I was lost. No future plans were foreseen. Reckless, Angry. No matter the cost. My soul in need. A puzzle scattered out on the floor. The pieces, they mattered no more. Lost, lonely, behind the disguise. Then came one look in your eyes. The tree, The limb, The ER, Stop. A look, A nurse, It stopped my heart. So sure was I that he'd concede. The games I played, he won indeed. The song, Three tasks, The risk - My heart. A flight, A ghost, A ride - A Start. You're all I want. You're all I need. The path is paved. You healed my heart. You saved my life, you stirred my soul. You picked me up and made me whole. You are my one true love. You are my one true love. Michael. What you have given me I'll never be able to repay. But I'm ready to try. I'm ready to spend the rest of my life trying. You've given me more than I ever could have hoped for, Michael. My heart really does stop when you look at me. Wherever you go. That's where I belong. No regrets. No turning back. Michael Garner. Will you marry me? Yes! My God - Yes! I love you so much. I love you. We're getting married. The health of an echosystem depends on diversity. And we, the great naked apes of the earth might try to remember this. Remember that the human experience is made more beautiful By the contribution of individuals Who enrich our lives and expand our perspectives. Not by being normal, but by being weird. And uniqe. And different from ourselves. So, I came out of the trees. I stopped living vicariously on tree branches I quit living in fear of an uncertain future. I took the offer of an outstretched hand. An offer that came without condition or restriction. I stopped running circles around the limitations of my parents bigotry. And I found that I was standing on a solid foundation That did not require their validation or acceptance. I stopped trying to fix everything that I was told was wrong with me and was finally able to embrace myself. and allowed myself to have what I deserved. Then I found my purpose. Maybe everyone's purpose. To love ourselves and one another for who we are - All that we are. Making up our own definition for love For a home. For success. For family. Stengthening relationships with those who accept us for the one and only essential factor. The one quality we all have in common. We are human. That sense of equaltiy and unconditional acceptance Allows our souls to stir and shine To find support. Give and care for one another. Our biological ties are not always the one's that will carry us when we are weak. Nor are they the ones we can count on to celebrate when we succeed. We don't always get a happily ever after. But if we hold on. We can achieve a Happy after everything else. My father, wanted only two things. He could have had so much more.
