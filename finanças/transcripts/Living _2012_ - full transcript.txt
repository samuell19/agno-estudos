Artyom, get away from the window. But it's... Enough already, there's nobody there. Get on your computer, now! Did we buy it so you could... stare out the window? I can take it back, you know. Let's go! LIVING Mama! Anton, come here! What now? Roly-poly's rolling around. What, on a sled? On a bike! Hurry UP! Grishka, I'm not interested. Mama, hurry! You'll miss it! Wow, look at him! He's got a card on there, too. Where? On the wheel, see? So it goes brrm-brrm. Mama! Brrm-brrm... Brrm-brrm... Brrm-brrm... Brrm-brrm... Brrm-brrm... Is he bleeding or something? I don't know, I didn't see. Yeah, he knocked his teeth out... Mama! Why are you still in bed? Let's go! Coming... Go take your pills first. I put up the wallpaper... Got the linoleum done... The bedsheets are fresh, just like you said. Let's see the kitchen. Let's go. It's freshly painted. And washed. I scrubbed everything, top to bottom. With chemicals, with soda. Show me the fridge. The roaches left on their own. Back then. Hey! Hey, let me see, what you got? Shitting Grishka. Show me! Mama! I'm deleting it. Keep looking, there's more. Mama, what's this? It's this. Mama. You're mental... Why aren't you dressed yet? I'm going. So go. OK... Hey! And take your pills! What? Nothing... Hello, Lena, it's me! Here's why I'm calling. I got Kapustina playing mummy again. She's not drinking, she's getting things fixed up. Sitting there like goddamn Mother Teresa... How should I know? I don't know. Here's why I'm calling. Can you bring the Kapustin girls over today? She's begging, she's practically on her knees... Where's your driver? And what shall we do? Well I don't know what to do. Leave me alone! Listen, we gotta think of something? So what's the big deal? Put them on a bus. So what? What could go wrong? For God's sake, it's an hour and a half. Take the driver's passport details. Give him my number. We'll meet them... You think I need this? Come on, Lena, don't bullshit me... Who are we gonna tell? What's she getting out of it? There, that's the spirit! Alright! OK, call me as soon as they're gone. OK. Bye. I'm waiting. - They're coming? - Yeah, yeah, they're coming. Thank you. Would you like tea? Sure, let's have some tea. Did she drool on you? Fuck, what's this stuff on me? I'm gonna go look for teeth. What teeth? The old man's! Here, I found one. Mama! Still got the root. Mama, you moron, it's got a cavity! Sure, maybe a little. Idiot! Tooth decay's contagious, you idiot! Go wash your hands, stupid! You ass, I saw it was just a piece of paper. It was a piece of paper. Where did you go? I saw it, it was a piece of paper. Still got the root. If you scare me, I'm going straight home... Where are you? Dumbass, what's the matter with you? Shut up! Look. Where's the tooth? Here. Look, right there! You better not do anything else! Just look! What the hell's that? A Penguin. No, seriously. I can't see from here. A wood pecker. It must be mental, eating the house. Yeah, he's mental. Are you confused? The tree's over there. Mama, he's looking right at us. You scared him. Bullshit, it's your camera clicking. You scared him saying ?mama?, ?mama?! My violet's flowering out of season. It's like it's happy, too. It was just sitting there, and then... like it's gone crazy... Do you know if they flower this time of year? No idea. I know what happened. With what? The wood pecker. What happened? There's larvae inside the wall. So? It was eating them... Mama, it freaks me out. It's like a deathwatch beetle. Like a colorful grave. And staring like a bastard. - What are you staring at now? - Nothing. Then get away from the window! Always staring out the window! What are you, a retard? No, I'm just looking. Retards do things for no reason. Normal people do things for a reason. That makes you a retard. So I'm a retard. So you'll have to go to a nuthouse. So I'll go. Careful what you wish for! Igor, come over here! Igor! - What did he do? - He's gone nuts. Just standing there. Did you do your homework? Yes. Why are you talking to him like that? Like what? Like a smart ass! I said I did my homework, that's it! That's not it! Stuck in here like a hermit, not talking to anyone! What did we do to you? Staring and staring out the goddamn window. I'll board the damn thing up, and that'll be it! Nothing's good enough for him. You freaky son of a bitch! You listen to me, you shit! Quit fucking up the atmosphere in here! I've kept calm so far, but one day I'll wring your neck, got it? So here we are. Retards. What now? Get on with it, that's what... Or head home? Let's do it. Got it, Lena. Yes. License plate one-three-seven. Yes. Thank you. I owe you a chocolate bar. Yes. We'll be at the stop in an hour and twenty. The hell with your banya! I'm going home. I mean, driving home. Got any more advice? You've a one-track mind! Silly! You should be thinking of your soul instead! You're like a horny teenager. Christ our Lord, bless the union of these thy servants like you blessed the union at Cana of Galilee bless their beginning and their end, multiply the gifts of their life crown them with garlands in thy kingdom for they are good and pure and honor thy commandments unto ages of ages. Amen. Father and Son and the Holy Spirit The Holy of Holies, united in essence, the life-giving Trinity one God and thy kingdom bless thy servants and give them along fruitful life and strengthen their faith fulfill their earthly prayers and through the intercessions of your immaculate and blameless holy Mother, welcome them to the promised land. When my husband died, I kind of lost it. Evenings, I'd sit and drink until I could sleep. Otherwise, I'd pace and pace, like I had a toothache. Couldn't do anything. He was away for months at a time. Sometimes when I'd had a drink, I'd think he was away for work. One time, he just didn't come home. Never found the body. I went to a fortuneteller. He's dead, she said. Didn't even have anything to bury. I got so I didn't even notice people coming and going. Stopped washing dishes. The girls were starving. Filth everywhere. I know. We've been over this before. So, when they came to take custody... Nobody's taken custody over them yet. I mean, back when... That's when I realized. I'm sitting there, and it's like there's two of me, struggling. One going 'Get me a drink'. The other thinking 'Gotta save the kids'. The first one won. I went and got a bottle, and it was a week before I thought of anything. Went to their room. Their beds were Grey like mummies. All rumpled. I started screaming and ran outside. ?I killed my girls!? I even thought they'd dried up. The neighbours said you had them. I went back home. Couldn't even touch the beds. Then I end up punching myself in the nose... started bleeding. Ran straight to you guys... Just in time, too. I didn't want to tell you, but we even had some people looking to adopt. They were just waiting for the hearing. What are you doing? I keep seeing them. Lying next to each other. Arms and legs all stretched out. Both so skinny. Heads small, like flower bulbs. Nothing but apple stems on the plate. They'll be here soon. Still got their arms and legs Probably got a bit fatter, too. You've upset the dog, too. Natka! Quiet! Yeah, shouting'll work. You're probably trying to watch TV, and we're bugging you. It's finished. Can you believe this? Wow. Went and got married. Unbelievable. Morons. At least now, we won't be scared. I'm still scared. Can't forget that woodpecker... Why did you have to notice him? Sitting there, colorful bastard. A deathwatch beetle, like you said. Hey, bro, got any smokes? No. You boozing? Drinking. How about a taste, bro? Get a glass, we'll give you some. What is she, your lawyer? I'm more of a prosecutor. Listen, why I came over: can you spare a tenner, bro? Listen, you're starting to get on my nerves. I gotta buy some grub. Two days on the road. Going to visit my mother. No water, no food. Like a camel. My mother is 65, can you imagine? Here. I was a late child. Listen, bro, you're a cool guy. The chick's alright. Let me know if you need anything You help me, I help you. Come over and help us put up wallpaper. Well, enough chit chat. I still have to... I'll leave you alone. Be well! Little bloodsucker! Textbook case. At least he didn't pull a knife on us - thank God for that. He seemed calm enough. At least we had some fun for our money. Alright, let's get to it We haven't had a drink yet... OK. Well, congratulations! Congratulations. Hey, bro, if it's not too much trouble, help me with my backpack. What, you don't have anyone else to ask? The carriage is empty. My stop is coming up. Help me out. Bring it over here. Come on, it's over there, between the carriages! Whatever. Rail, rail, tie, tie, the train is late. From the last carriage, peas begin to pour. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Hey! What are you doing? Hey! You bastards! What are you doing? He's sick! He's sick! You bastards! He's sick! He's sick! Help! Somebody, help! Help! Help! Somebody! Somebody, help! Help! Somebody, help! Somebody, help! Cleaner came and swept it up, put up the table, sat down, and started writing a letter. My sweet little daughters I bought you all flowers. Daddy's dead! Daddy! Hold him down! What's wrong with him? How am I supposed to know? - Daddy! - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Hold him. What are you doing, you stupid cow? He's driving me crazy! - What are you doing? - Shut up, you son of a bitch! You were traveling with the young man? Yes. Is he allergic to any medications? What? - Does he have allergies? - I don't know, no. - So, no, or you don't know? - No. - Hepatitis, HIV? - No. - What's your last name? - Grishina. Are you going to wait here? Yes, he does. - Does what? - Have HIV. - Why didn't you say so? - I did say so. Galya! He's an AIDS patient. He doesn't have AIDS. So what does he have? We all have children, by the way. Tell us these things right away. Galya, come here, I need to tell you something. I told you to wait there! - I lied. - Wait there! I lied. Can't you understand Russian? You want us to throw you out? There are rules, you know. I lied. Calm down, he'll get treated like anyone else! Where are you going? Going for a smoke. God, you're all driving me crazy! Why, it's not allowed? It's allowed, go ahead! Is that your guy in there? Yeah. They're saying he'll be fine. I saw the doctor. He's a good doctor. You're lucky he's on call. The other one's a total retard. Ignore the woman in glasses, she's always yapping about something. - So what happened? - We got robbed. That's some robbing! Me, I went for a ride in a car. Didn't go well. What did they take? Phone and wallet? Looks like they're looking for you. Are you looking for her? Who's she? The ones who got robbed. - Was that you? - Yes. They were saying it was a guy. She's with him. Well, let's write it up. Have a seat. What's with your hand? Cut it on the glass. What glass? A bottle? Were you drinking? No. So I'm the one that reeks of alcohol? That's wine. Drinking non-alcoholic wine, then? Sit, sit! Who are you? I have a bed here. So why are you standing? What? Go back to bed, we'll figure this out without your help. Sanya, you need my help? Go ask the doctor how bad it is. See if we can talk to him. To whom? The victim. Get them to do a report. What kind of report? That you're retarded! An injury report So just say that. No need to yell. Moderately severe injuries. Did you examine him? The doctors were talking. OK, well, I'll send you a subpoena, you can come and tell us everything. They're keeping me here for another ten days. That's terrible! There goes our investigation. OK, let's get down to business. I, so-and-so, when and where and with whom. I cut my hand on the glass in the train. And about that, too. Natka, Natka. What's the matter with you? Your owners are coming. They'll be dragging you around the yard by the collar. You won't know what hit you. What's the matter, stupid girl? You little coward! What are you afraid of? Talk to me! Talk to me! Talk to me! Talk to me! Talk to me! Sanya, why'd you send me in there? He's already dead. They're breathing! Yes, Galya. It's steam. It's because they came out of a warm room. But they're breathing. They're not breathing, it's steam. What are you doing? Burying them alive? Galya... What kind of laws are these? First, they take children away, then you bury them alive. Galya. Don't touch me. You don't want to give my kids back, fine. Let them live at the orphanage. Or let somebody adopt them. I've got dolls. To give to them. What are you trying to pull? Burying them alive. Galya, that's enough. It's a trick, I'm telling you A car crash! What car crash? Gave them a bunch of drugs so they don't wake up. Do you think I'm stupid? You think I'm stupid, is that it? Galya! That's enough! Getting worried, huh? Good, you should be worried! I'll go all the way to the President. Put your entire gang in jail. They're burying them alive! No other country allows this sort of thing. What drugs did you give them? Do something. She's hysterical. What did you give them?! Cut up their faces. I knew it right away. Rented the morgue. Bribed everybody. Just to bury them alive! And they don't even care! Do you even have a conscience? What did you give them? What did you give my girls? What did you give them? That's it. She'll be out for a few hours. Then give her some valerian, or diazepam. Or call us, we'll do another shot. Thank you. - Would you like something to eat? - No, no. We have to go. Yeah... Galya, how are you feeling? Better? Want something to eat, in memory? - Can I untie her? - Sure. Good bye. Galya, I'm gonna untie you, OK? Pull her tights up... What are you standing there for with your mouth hanging open? Want something to eat? There we go. No Galya, no vodka for you. Want some pie and some juice? There you go. There, in memory. The girlish eat here with us. Probably hungry by now... It's a good pie. What a mess. I need to ask you something. I'm listening. Well? What's love for? What? Why love? They get taken away anyway. Who gets taken away? Someone I know. What, drafted into the army? Well... So he'll be back. Separation is a test. But for now, would you mind? Drop by, I'll read a prayer for him. That's not what I mean. What do you mean? - Can you read burial rites for me? - What? A burial service for me. Can you do it? - You mean a christening? - A burial! That's for the dead, not the living... And what am I? Living. Aren't you? Can't you tell the difference? I can tell you've been drinking. That's my business. That's true, but I have no intention to debate a drunk. Come back tomorrow for the service, then we'll talk. I don't need a debate! Just read the burial service! And how do you expect me to do that? I can buy a coffin. This is crazy! Go home. It's your fault! You sold us Chinese candles. Real candles don't go out, you hear me?! You hear me?! Galya! What? I have to go, it's my shift. Tomka will stay, OK? She can go too. No way. - I want to be alone. - No. Or come over to our place. I don't want to. Then Tomka will stay here. There's vodka left from the funeral. I was afraid to take it home. If my man finds it, he'll drink it all. Don't you touch it either. It's for the ninth day. You and Tomka can eat the pies and meat. I'm running late. Watch her like a hawk. Anything happens, I'll kill you! Ma said not to! Mama will kill me. I'll kill you myself... My girls will freeze. What? Should've thought of it earlier. When you created all this. This. You know what I'm talking about. Not much of a creator, are you? You can go to hell. I can't help you. Go to hell, you hear me? Cross my path again, and you'll wish you'd hanged yourself. That's it, I'm not listening to you any more. I'm not listening. I'm not listening. I'm not listening. What? Aren't you going to get it? Who is it? It's that dimwit, crawling back. Go get it, Igor. It's all a bit confusing. We dug and dug, didn't dig enough and now you're telling us to go? You're not being straight with me, Galya. Not being straight at all. I want my share of the gold! What gold? I know you've got gold... in there! I'll get it myself. It's just documents, Edik. Documents, gold, I don't give a shit. I'll take it all myself. Don't touch them, Edik! Them who? I'll put a stake through their brains! What are you doing, you bastard?! You bastard! You bastard! The blood smells like alcohol. Can't remember how much I drank. Couldn't you have called? They took my phone. With the woodpecker photos? With the photos. Well, fuck it then. You made me break the window... Let's put a blanket over it for now. Sure. You've got no teeth. I know. Mama, I even went to the church, started yelling at the priest, talking shit, drunk. I think I pushed him. Can you imagine? I keep feeling like you cheated on me. Everything's different. Strange. Not like it used to be. Before, when I saw funerals even on our own block I really didn't care. I was just curious to know who died, and why. Meanwhile somebody's world was collapsing. Everything had changed. Forever. You can't die. You hear me, you bastard? You can't... Look at us, all bandaged up like... Are you sleeping? Did you at least break his nose? Nah, I just pushed him around a bit. Pathetic dimwit... When I was living with him, every day I wanted to kill him... Such a feeling he's... so pathetic. This one's gonna grow up just the same. Loser. And you're defending him... Igor, what the hell? Are you all against me today? Everything's going wrong. It happens. Go to hell! Hello, let's dance. I love music. Take me in your arms. Dance with me. That's great! Now sing me a song. What about another song? I like it! Hello, let's dance! I love music. Take me in your arms. Dance with me. That's great! Now sing me a song. What about another song? I like it! How's it hanging? Awesome? I see your shoes are at the pawn shop. Aren't you gonna freeze your hooves off? Answer me! Too proud, I see. So why are we here, if we're so proud? Waiting for the apartment? Proud people usually just take their toothbrush and leave. My boy. Your boy? Fuck's sake! It's a girl, not a boy! Wanna take her? And where, I wonder? To your patch of mud? Your boy! Weren't too concerned about him when playing your slot machines! Lose your money, and your son, and your manhood too? Here, I've got loads of it, I can share. I can share. Here's a son, here's a daughter. Do you mind that they're not yours? Well neither is that one. He's mine. Who told you that? I know. You don't know nothing. He's Igor?s. - He's mine. - Igor?s. - Mine. - Igor?s. - Mine. - Shut up, you bitch. I didn't even cum because of you. Get up, and out of here! Up and out of here! Up and out of here! Get up, and out of here Up and out of here! What's up, dimwit? My hand's all bruised because of you. You want to see me get real mad? Huh? Want to, fatass? Stay here. Igor! Where are the keys? The keys! He took Artyom. - What do you mean, he took him? - Where are your keys? Galya!.. Galya! Galya! Are you in there? Galya! What have you done? Galya! Are you in there or what? Galya, I know everything! Galya! Galya, what have you done? - She's not in there. - The sled's there. - So? - She took the sled with her. She took the sled! What did I tell you? - And she... Galya! Galya! Galya! Galya, what have you done? Huh? Don't shout, I've got kids here. Why did you dig up the girls? Go away. Galya, you smashed Edik's head. He's at the hospital. Go away. Galya, the cops are on their way. I won't let anyone take them. See sense, woman, it's a sin! Nobody's taking them. You need another shot. I'll call an ambulance. Go away. They're mine. They're mine. What a mess! She's gone completely crazy. They're mine. Let's go call them. What a mess. They're mine. OK, I' m ready. - Ready for what? - To go look for him. Well, I'm not ready. Can't you see I'm smoking? So smoke. Galya, is everything OK in there? Galya, let the doctors in, they're here. Go away, I turned on the gas. They'll give you a shot, then they'll go. And the cops too. I turned on the gas. Nobody's going to take them. Galya, I talked to them about it. They already took them. Let the doctors in, and that's it. Or I can give you the shot, huh? I have matches. Put the matches away for now, Galya! I'll tell them to go. There, Galya, I talked to them, they're leaving. They'll just call their boss and go. Galya, pull yourself together! We want to help, Galya. I'm gonna break the door down! Look what you've done! Galya! Go away. GO away, go away, go away Go away. Go away. Anton. I have to go. Go to the bank, get money for the funeral. And I have to call your mother. Make arrangements. I shouldn't have told him that his father died. Lots of people don't. Children don't take these things well. He can't forgive me. Thinks it's all my fault But it was because of all the debt. He played slots. OK, I have to go. Hang in there. Went and drowned himself, the bastard... and now we have to live with it. See the psychiatrist tomorrow. We will. Some people visit mediums. Good bye. Yeah.
