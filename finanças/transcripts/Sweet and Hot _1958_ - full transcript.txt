That was great. Larry, you're back. Joe... Oh... Boy, you got strong. Larry. Tiny. Oh. Oh. My cigars. Oh, I'm sorry. Skip it, honey. You were terrific. Oh, thanks. Oh, Larry, it's so good to see you. Yeah, and you're a big success in a night club. I read your press notices. Exactly why I came back. To get you and your sister to join my act. I can get us some terrific bookings in New York. Well, sorry, Larry, but we're gonna stay right here on the farm. Oh, sis, you... You-You can't do that. Certainly not. With that supple voice and that pretty face... Oh, Larry, do you still think I'm pretty? I think you're prettier than a spotted heifer. That's the sweetest thing you ever said to me, but nevertheless, we're gonna stay right here on the farm. Think of the money you'll make. Eh. Think of New York. Uh-uh. The theater. Nah. The lights. Uh-uh. The food. Steaks that thick. Great, big, gorgeous lobsters. Chicken cacciatore. Spaghetti Tetrazzini. Mm. And strawberry shortcake with strawberries... Hold it! And whipped cream... Stop! I couldn't eat another bite. Then it's a deal. You've convinced me. When do we eat? I mean, when do we leave? Right now. Get packed. Okay. Hey, wait a minute. You know I've always been afraid to sing in front of people. I freeze up. I get paralyzed. Aw, stage fright can be cured. I know just the guy that can do it. Get packed. Okay. Hey, we're on our way. We're going. Oh, boy. New York, here we come. Hey. What's the... And this is the young lady I was telling you about, doctor. Pleased to meet you, young lady. Please, sit down. Yes, sir. Gentlemen, take a chair. Gee, thank you. Here, here, here. Please don't take them home. Indian giver. And so: Your name please. Tiny Landers. Good. Where you was born? In bed. Hm. No, no, I mean what state? Oh, uh, Kansas. And what part? All of me. It's a good thing it's a big state. When you was a little girl you ever did something naughty? Well, once I drank a bottle of ink. Incredible. Uh-uh, "indelible." So far you understand. Nothing. Maybe you got a physical block. I see. Oh, my. Where you got those beautiful blue eyes? They just came with her head. Please, my time is linament. I mean, "limited." Now, please, open your mouth and push your tongue inside out. Good. It's a good thing you don't use binoculars. No jokes. Please, open your mouth. I don't want to walk in, I just want to look. A-ha! A-ha-ha-ha. What is it, doc? Nothing. I just thought of something funny. Ooh. Please, go. Go. I'll go. Off we go. Please, you come with me. Also: This way, over here. Now, please, lie down. Lie down? But I'm not sleepy. Please, lie down. Yes, go. Now, I give you some words and you tell me the first thing what comes to your mind. So I say "Los Angeles," you say: Smog. Smog. Good. Now, I say "giraffe": Great neck. Nein. Ten. Eleven. Now you have got me doing that. Now, please, pay attention. The next word: "rock." Roll. Rock 'n' roll... You know something? I sing and dance rock 'n' roll. But I am a much better dancer than I am a singer. Really? I show you. Very interesting. Danke sein. Come and tell me all about it. Yes. Please, lie down. Oh, certainly. Now, tell me, sir. Why didn't you study music and dancing? Well, you see, first I have to study medicine and physics. I am the doctor is it! I am a dommkomf. Please, you sit. Now, you sit. As I understand, uh, your trouble is you cannot sing in front of people, yeah? That's right, doctor. Then you are a necrophobe. Say, watch your language. Ach. I believe we better probe into your past. Now, just relax and sleep. Sleep and relax. Relax and sleep. Just sleep. Sleep and relax. Just sleep. Just sleep. No, you don't. You're not gonna jab me with that thing. It is nothing. Just a little sodium pent-ten-ta-ten-ta-ten... Truth serum. I don't care what it is. No needles. I'm getting out of here. Wait. Don't get your brains in an uproar. Sure, there's nothing to it. I'll let him inject me first. Did you say something? Just a minute. He's fainted. Just a minute, I give him artificial respiration. Artificial? For what you charge, you give him the real thing. Go away, you make me nervous. Don't get excited, doc... Who's getting excited? Mother, oh, it's you. Go away, you loafer. Not so loud. Don't pick on him. Give it to him, Larry. Yeah. He gave it to you. Oh, shut up. Outside. All right. Now, please, young lady, no more nonsense. And no more needles and that's final. Ow! Easy, easy, easy. Oh, my... I warned you not to jab me with that thing. Now I... Oh, I feel so silly. I feel very, very sleepy. Good, good. Lie down, go to sleep. You are now drifting back. Back to your childhood. You are now a little girl. Tiny is six years old. What did you want to be when you were six? Seven. Tiny is four years old. What did you want to be when you was four? Seven. You are in a rut. Tiny likes to sing. Tiny likes to play-act. Tiny likes to... I'm a little teapot, short and stout. This is my handle, and this is my spout. I can change my handle and my spout.
