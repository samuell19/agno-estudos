We used to wait for the party addresses at Moscow Square every Saturday night. Everyone who thought they were cool gathered here. That day was my 18th birthday. I remember I wanted a pair of cowboy boots. Girls like those sorts of things, and I'd never had a girlfriend yet. Today is April 27th, 1989. - Happy fucking birthday! - Thanks. Watch me, man! It's a necessity, especially as an adult. - What did you get? - A Swiss watch. - Water proof? - No. It's my grandfather's watch. - What can it do? - Nothing. You have to wind it up. Fuck that! Didn't they figure that shit out for the 18th? I'm starting to like that damn motorcycle. I got it instead of a car. I've got the addresses. 8 Orom St. They're sure about it. - There's an another one up on the hill. - That's awesome! I live in the neighborhood. There's one at 17 Karoly Szasz St. We'll start at the hill then go down. Why not Karoly Szasz? It's just a few minutes from here. Don't be an idiot. All these people want to go there. Your mom's an idiot. - What've you got? - 17 Karoly Szasz St. - Everyone knows that. - Then we'll go home to sleep. MOSCOW SQUARE Fuck! What's going on? Out of gas? - Who threw out that bottle? - You have to say "sir". Get off! You're a nice guy. We wanted to get off right here anyway. Get off! Get the hell off of my bus! Bus drivers can't put their hands on me! - Get off my bus! - Your bus? It's the people's! Jerk. You know who the jerk is? Gas him! You're the jerk! Just clap your hands but you'll cry! - Go down! - No one said we had to walk. Relax, relax. You go first. - May I help you? - Zoli called us. - Which Zoli? - Zoli Kocsis. - Are you the party host? - Something like that. Don't shit me, my brother's in there. I have to talk to him. Take off your shoes! Who're they? Hey. You want some chianti? - There's the fag. - My classmates. Let's look aroud. Don't ask! Come on! This place's full of dweebs. A bunch of little Sagodis. - The garden looks nice. - We have to get rid of those nerds. - They're pretty boring. - I don't get how they can stand that. - You got a light? - No. Excuse me, you got a light? Hey! Who, me? Sure. - Hi Kigler! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - What're you doing here? - Today's his birthday. The 18th? That's awesome! - There's some champagne in the kitchen. - Thanks for the tip. - Only two of you? - Yeah, two. U2. That's cool. Fucking Boney M! A sip of death. What the fuck is this? - Published by... - Don't read it, just put it away! - We know this girl, don't do that! - Don't be a moron! - Do you watch the high mass? - This's some kind of movie. You don't have Rambo? Put it on. How kind of you. Let's get out of here! I can't take this slow motion any more. Stop! Will you take us to the Gellert Hill for a bottle of scotch, sir? Show me! - Brand new! - Get in! - 8 Orom St. Above the aquifer. - Alright, but I won't turn on the taximeter. Sure, but turn on the radio or I'll tear apart the drape! Change the station! - Don't throw up! - You've got your whisky don't worry! Alright, I'm just warning you. Once, goulash ended up on my neck. - I'm taking a piss. - Hurry up! "6" and "10"? Where the fuck is "8"? I'll bet we have to go up a floor. It's closed. Ring the bell! If there's no "8" then we lost a bottle of whisky. You know that? Relax! There has to be an "8". - What do you want? - We're looking for Rajnai. 8 Orom St. There's no "Rajnai" here and no "8 Orom St"! What you mean "no 8"? - I mean the City Hall fucked up! - Go to bed! I knew you'd fuck up again! Get the hell out of here! Don't make any noise here! This is a residential area! It happens sometimes, OK? It's nothing! A fake address, that's all! Yeah, "nothing"! You're a fag, a prick and a moron at the same time! The whole apartment cannot sleep because of you! They are coming in! They are sitting there! My dear boy, I will call the police! It's the cops! - Come on! - What? The back stairs! - Go back! - Hey man, relax! This is the best food ever. But I don't get why they put sauerkraut in it. I like it as it is. - Are you going in on Monday? - I don't give a shit. - What if you drop out? - Same thing. We don't want to go to college, do we? - You walking? - Yeah. I'll catch a cab. I'll call you tomorrow. - 'Morning. - Hi. - How was it? - Rough. - What does that mean? - Leave me alone! - Do you want some coffee? - No. - Where have you been? - Partying. - You drank something? - Just a little champaigne. I want to sleep. - What do you want for lunch? - I don't care. You care about nothing. You need to wind this up once in a while. You should learn that. There were people everywhere. The line reached the boulevard. It was an awesome feeling. - There weren't any cops? - Yeah, with a minivan at the bridge. - Was it as rough as the last time? - No, it wasn't. - Did you make that mess? - What mess? You smashed up the bathroom and a lot of items disappeared. Leave me alone! - I'm sure it wasn't them! - I'm sure it was them. You came with Kigler only, didn't you? We met at the terrace, didn't we? Who were those other two guys? - I don't know, leave me alone! - I saw four of you come in! Don't bullshit me, you fucking asshole! - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm happy to see the thirst for knowledge and the fresh faces. I report, sir: the Sun's shining, one more week to go 'til summer holiday, I'm feeling well, I'm mentally balanced, and no one's missing. I'm unbelievably happy. - Kigler's missing. - As usual. - Petya! - Yeah? - Do you know something about Kigler? - He's sick, probably. I've got good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first? The good news! There was a decision up in the Ministry, - a decision that will affect high-school graduation... in consideration of the political situation the history test questions after 1945 will not be part of the graduation exam. That's great news for everyone, for you... because you have to learn four fewer test topics, and for me, because while the content of this book is "incredibly accurate", I can't say it's 100% true. Hooray! Oh, my boy, Kigler. I apologize for starting the lesson without you. No problem, sir. You missed the good news, now the bad. Mrs. Juhasz sends you this message: If you don't show up to her lesson, she won't let you to take part in the graduation exam. Thank you, sir, for this useful information. Welcome, my boy. Happy new year! They were this close to catching me. The cops showed up and everyone was pushed back into the apartment. Royal tried to protect the owner of the house, but then he got arrested. - How do you know that? - The fuck do you mean "how do I know"? I talked to my friend on the phone. - So, then they let them out? - Sure. After for two or three hours. Royal kicked a cop in the stomach. Seriously. What're you laughing at? After that they sprayed gas on them and that's it. - Did Csomor get busted? - Him? He's the king of steal. Don't smoke in here. It gets on my nerves. - Why don't you say hello, bitch? - I did. Now take your feet off. - Who heard you say it? Huh? - Your mother. What did you say you commie faggot? I'm not a communist you new-money punk! Kigler, go to the board! Write up example #4084. Ma'am, we've already done that one! Write it. He wasn't here anyway. "17 boys go on a two-day trip." Where're the girls? Forget that. OK? "There are one 8-bed, one 4-bed," Carry on! "one 3-bed and one 2-bed rooms in the tourist house." Enough! - We didn't do anything! - Leave the classroom, both of you! - But ma'am! - Did you not understand what I said? Hurry up, young man! Let's go Kigler! - "How do we...?" - Write it! - This's a pretty easy problem. - Then go on! 17 boys we add the three rooms to it... That was completely unfair, wasn't it? I don't want to see this exercise book ever again! Hey, would you wait a second! - Did you "decorate" the bathroom? - Me? Are you crazy? It was Petya, he does that kind of stuff. - Yeah, sure I do. - He overreacted a bit. - Don't fall for it! It was probably those two other guys. - Four of you came in at the same time! - No, there were just two of them, remember? I know that you did it and I think it's disgraceful! Bye, Petya! - Check this out! - Whose car is this? It's mine, of course! Just get inside. A fucking Porsche? Get in! Thanks for the help, "buddy"! We're going upstairs to relax a bit. Bye! - What's up? Don't you like porn? - Sure, but this is more interesting. - Oh, come on! - Then you watch it! Why do you have to get bothered right now? Hello...Juditka? No, no! Don't tell me...Krisztike! Hey, this's my favourite tape! Where was it? Gabor put it in, but they're upstairs now. No problem! Have fun! - Whisky? - No, thank you. - Graduation? - We haven't even had prom, yet. - How are you? - Fine. - Everything OK? - Yes. - Math? - It's fine. Gym? I have to go. I have a lot of studying. Don't rush! Where're you going? Stay! Aren't you feeling "fine"? Yes. Bye. Fucking go then! - Hello, uncle Jancsi! - Hi. - Who was that chick? - Classmate. - Did you fuck her? - No, she didn't let me. She's nice. Don't miss the opportunity! - Your grandma? - She's OK. Gabor's at home! - He managed to pass math. - Heard that. The Porsche is superb! What Porsche? This is my most expensive car, goddammit! How could you do such a stupid thing? He said you knew about it. Pick up the phone and ask ME! I should fucking fire you for this! Oh, come on boss! He's your son! Do you really think, that my asshole kid could ride my best car? - It's not his fault! - Shut the fuck up! Get off that car! If you gave me your own car, I wouldn't have to do this. What did I get for my 18th birthday, huh? Not even a bicycle! OK, OK, forget about it! And I drank water like a flower! Shut up! Did something happen, boss? I'll fucking kill you! - Uncle Jancsi! - What? - Can I get in? - Are you stupid? - How much is that Zhiguli? - The red one? 50,000. Beautiful car! 50,000 is nothing for this! 45,000 just for you, huh? Used to be a cab, but it's still in top shape! 40,000 is my last offer! Only because of your grandma! Try it you fool! Pedal to the metal! - Delicious, eh? - Tasty! - Just like your father. - They don't look alike. Don't tell me that! He grew up next to me. - Can I have more potatoes? - Gobble up! - We found a cheap Zhiguli. - What for? We're going to be cab drivers. What? On our own. There's a lot of money in it. - But those who are self-employed... - What about them? You can't be serious! You wanted me to have a decent job. - Stop fooling around! - Why, what else did you have in mind? I thought you were going to college. What good is that for? - I thought... - Thought what? You cannot be a cab driver! Then what else? - You said something about an engineer. - That was a long time ago. - You won that drawing contest! - Sure, the drawing contest. - Where are you going? - To our place, to watch a video. - At this time? - Why? No school tomorrow. How? Comrade! Did you forget that tomorrow is Worker's Day? My God! Give me a cigarette! We'll buy the cheapest international train ticket, erase it, then photocopy it. - Got it? - Not really. Don't be so dumb! We need a colour copier. My dad will fix that at his company. We need someone to fill it in properly. Petya will do that. Alright. He's an artist. If this works, then we'll have loads of money. Drink! - Now what? Going home? - Tomorrow's Worker's Day. Swimming pools are open! - They're filling up the pools today. - I love you Csomor. - What's up Picasso? Are you tired? - Look! What's up, angel? Moscow Square? I'm waiting for somebody. - Me? - Sure. - Hello. - Are you waiting for that nerd? Leave me alone! And you? Just hanging out? We're going to the Gellert Bath to swim. Come with us! - I don't have any swimsuit with me. - Neither do we. Come on, bitches! Here comes the tram! Where are you going? To the Russian Embassy. - Well, so long! - Come on, for fuck's sake! - Man, what kind of underwear is that? - Fuck you, look at Petya's! It's cold! Don't bring your watch with you! You stay out, you're not wearing a bath cap! What're you doing here? Get the hell out of here! - Let us swim a little! - What? Don't you want to earn some extra money, sir? - How much are we talking about? - 500. For 800, I'll give you some waves too. - We have 500 only, sir. - Then go home. - How much have you got? - It's in my pants, take it! I'll be right back, sir. If this works, I'll buy that Porsche from my dad. I want to see you tell him. I'm going to buy a land rover. With chromed rims! We'll cover the Moscow Square with carpet. We'll be able go anywhere, to Amsterdam, or whatever! Sure, but then we'll go to Lake Balaton and I'll buy Sio Tour. What are you doing in the middle of the bridge? Having breakfast, officer. - In the middle of the bridge? - Why, is it against the law? Show me your IDs. Hurry up, boys! Where are these chairs from? Our friend is moving to a new place but we didn't have enough space for these. We're helping to bring them across. Students, they're alright. - Where did you get those crescent rolls? - At a 24/7 shop. And I'm supposed to believe that? I'm serious. Are you hungry? Want a piece? Man can stay hungry in this fucking city. There nothing to eat all night long. - Where's that 24/7 shop? - First or second street. - Meszoly St? - I don't know. One or two blocks away. - Do you know where it is? - Yeah, I know. We wish you the best! Happy Worker's Day! Happy Worker's Day! Sorry. Wait! Stand here and shut up! Give that flower to him with your right hand! I can handle it, leave me alone! Now! You should have shaved! - Hi, grandma Boci! - Hello. Hi, grandma Boci. We'll talk later! - OK if I record? - Better not! Thanks. - Did you see David? - No. Go to the school yard, I'll meet you there. - How long has this been going on? - I don't know. Dear parents! Family members, friends. Dear graduating students! Keep quiet for just two more minutes! This is a new period in our lives. You'll be adults. You'll start living a real life, and there is a long and rough road ahead of you. - Why're you so nervous? - I'm not. Your boyfriend didn't show up? Leave me alone! Knowledge, solid faith, building blocks... Building blocks, sure! Congratulations! Bricks or mortar? And after long years, when your youth passes away... Stop! will gild your old years. Gild your ass, you cow! I wish all of you good luck and happiness. Girls, boys! Journey well! - Finally! - It was awful for me, too! - David really wasn't here? - We didn't see him. Forget about David! - You became so tall! - Thank you! I got your grandma ready! Congratulations anyway. Thank you. The principal spoke beautifully. - I'm glad you feel that way. - So, what's this? Hello, grandma Boci. - Hello, my boy. So, what's this? Porsche key! - You got the Porsche? - Come on! I'll be back later! Cool car, huh? Who's this moron? Pull over! - What's up? - We've got the test questions! Relax, you know we have to do this! We'll go up to eat soon. There'll be booze too. Why do we have to do this? We wait until they finish singing, then we go upstairs. Come on up, you're embarrassing me! Get up here, already! Come in, come in. I didn't think you were coming! Good evening! Good evening, sir! How are you? Have a seat! Sir, read this. "Lajos Nagy: January, Attila Jozsef..." What's this? - The graduation test questions. - Allegedly the real ones. No! It's sure, my dad got it. - Who are you? - Zsolt Kiraly. Istvan Szechenyi High School, gym class. Strength and health, sir! His dad got these from the highest level, supposedly. - Are you kidding me? - No. My best friend. Trust me, I'm trusting you, sir! Sir, who the heck is "Lajos Nagy"? You must understand that it's not a problem if someone gets an "A"... What if we publicize this? Everybody will find out about "chaos" and "corruption" in the country. - My dear boy, what do you want to publicize? - Everything. Whatever happens here. - What? Could you tell us? - Sure, I could tell you... - It cannot be proven. - Then what could we do? Well, for example... we make it to the end. Then we say to their faces that we could do it. So tell them just like that? That someone leaked this information? For example. - Something wrong? - No, I'm just bored. Yeah. They camp it up a bit. You've never seen such a beautiful bathroom! And the college preliminary exam test questions are in my pants. - So, did he call you? - Ah, he's an idiot. He's an arrogant egotistical jerk. - That was written all over his face. - Thanks. Please do not use any unauthorized materials! Otherwise I will have to suspend whoever does. Folks, please be fair. 1st topic: The literary analysis of the Lajos Nagy novel January. I'll write it on the blackboard in case someone fails to remember. "Lajos Nagy" "January" - Thank you, ma'am. - Where are you going? Home. Where do you think? I'm done. - In such a short time? - Sure. Good bye! I'm outta here! Did you see her face when I got up after just half an hour? I thought she'd start to cry. I filled up nine pages. She sneezed on my pen again. She touched my back with that hand! Thanks, we'll find our way in. Did you smell that? - Hi. - Hi. Tell me, how's it going? - Two beers, please! - It's on me! Shhh! It's the news! It's 11:00 AM and now the news. The high-school graduation examinations have started today. It has been suspected that in several high-schools the students knew the literature exam questions in advance. There will be a meeting in the Ministry related to this issue. - I don't believe it! - Fuck, I knew it! Look, if you say you didn't know they can't prove anything! - What if they repeat the test? - They could do that. - Did the teacher tell them? - Don't talk crap, Csomor! I'm going to talk to my dad. You'd better pray, man! - Go to your daddy! - So now what? I think they're gonna screw us. Give me that phone! Thank you. - We studied very much, you know! - OK, OK! Good afternoon, I'm looking for Mrs. Banki in the education department. If they force the students to retake that test, it'll be a disgrace! Hello Marika, it's Eva. I'm calling because Petya just did the graduation exam today, and no offense, but I don't understand what the problem is! What's going on over there? Tell her that we didn't know the questions for sure! They did not know! They studied well! Do you have to sing? Give it back! Jozsef Szilagyi will be buried in the 302th parcel. What's that, a combine? Haven't you ever seen a steamroller? Following his daughter's wish, Imre Nagy will be buried in the 301st parcel. - Who the hell is Imre Nagy? - I'll bet he's the brother of Lajos Nagy. Don't you realize what assholes you are? Quiet! There was a big shock in several high-schools. At 10:00 AM a group of students left after successfully completing a written test. The suspicion was not unsubstantiated. In the Ministry, it was handled as fact that the test questions were leaked. How many schools were affected by this scandal is not known, exactly. We were notified via phone so we asked the informants to make their statement in written form as well. Shut up! Written statements arrived from eight high-schools. We decided at the meeting that the results of the exam are invalid. We will regard the year-end grades as the final result. You know what this is? It's chaos! Chaos! Hah! All thanks to my dad! - It's much easier with a blade, isn't it? - Shut up! - How much is this train ticket? - 200 or so. - We should sell it for 3,000. - 2,000 for our friends. No friends. It's business. - Petya, this yours? - Put it back! Relax! Petya, tell me why are you living with your grandma? Don't be a prick. Leave him alone! Why? I don't know anything. His dad left. His mom's dead. Sorry, I didn't know that. - Where's your dad now? - I don't know and I don't care! Change the subject! - Royal, you ever been to the west? - London. When I was young. I remember it. I have a bunch of toy cars. Let's get out of here. - We're leaving! Bye! - Stay if you want to! Here's some fresh cake. Eat it! - Bye grandma Boci! - When will you be back? Is this today's profit? It's fucking pathetic. - May I help you? - I'm looking for someone. I think the lady's looking for the travel agency. - Actually...yes. - It's in that corner. - Hello. - Hello, how can we help you? - I need a train ticket. - A train ticket? - To Rome. - To Rome? Go outside. You'll find the Travel Agency on the other side of the road. Stop joking! How much is it? Can we help her? Give me 3,000. - Will you fill it? - No. There's a guy at the stairs. He'll fill it for you. - Do you handle the tickets? - Yeah. - Where to? - To Rome. In a sleeping car if possible. To Berlin, but I want to spend a few days in Prague. Barcelona. To Athens, but not across Romania! London. To Palermo via Rome. I want to go to Paris. - How did you know we're doing this? - Everybody knows! - Don't talk about it at school, OK? - I won't compromise my ticket. - Just through Vienna? - Yeah. - Lot of people going to Paris. - Yeah, gonna be a great party. - It's the 200th anniversary of the revolution. - What revolution? You're really good at history! You'll fail next week. - Leave me alone about that! - OK. Keep your eyes open. We're going upstairs. - Are you going by yourself? - Yeah, to my relatives. It's easy, that way. - Anything to drink? - No, thanks. I'm in a hurry. - Hello. - Hello. - At least give me 3,000! - What's wrong? We have a joint business! Joint business? What are you doing with the money? Me? Paying for the place, the booze, the cigarettes. What else do you want? Shut up! I can't concentrate! I'm fighting for your money too! Can't you see that? We just want to play. That's what I'm talking about! And you're bullshitting, here! - Do you want me to smack you? - Smack me! You can't live life. That's your problem! Ferike! Four rounds of scotch and a pack of Marlboros! The six coffins create discipline. After a brief argument an agreement was reached that the Young Democrats will be the first. Petya! - There any food? - In the fridge. The names of the accredited photographers and journalists fill many many pages. They're standing in long lines with flowers in their hands. First, citizens from the hometown of Imre Nagy lay the wreathes. Then Members of Parliament and City Hall... - Who're they? - I'll tell you later. No hot meal today? Here's some money. Go to the restaurant! Petya, bring me a bottle of beer, would you? Former classmates lay down their flowers. Life stops at half past twelve and church bells ring throughout the country. - Hi, Petya. - You promised me some exam notes. - Sure. And? - Will you bring them out? Come in, nobody's at home. What kind of notes do you want? Hello. Hi. We're studying. Go in! - What you need exactly? - History mostly. OK, just a second. We were at Heroes' Square then I came up. He helps me with math. We'll be done soon. - How was it? - What? - Heroes' Square. - It was good. There were a lot of people. This Sagodi's got a bunch of great stuff. - Don't touch that! - I didn't know it was that important. It's not that important just don't touch it. - See ya. - Which bus line do you take? - 86. - I'm coming with you. - Don't go! - I have to or I'll miss the last bus. - Don't do this! - See ya. - Don't say that! - Thanks for the help! - When are you leaving? - After prom. The next day. You told me you were going in the middle of July. Things changed a little. Seems I won't be doing the college entrance exam. How come? I managed to get in to the Sorbonne. - Where? - The Sorbonne. - What's that? - Petya, come on! It's like ELTE only it's in Paris. - So you're going away? - Would you stay if you were me? I don't know. - Come over here! - But ma'am! Pick a new one! - She's a little bit nervous. It happens. - Sure. - Jutka had to pick a new one! - Really? Poor girl. Maybe she needed to study more. You're a jerk! Number 16. World War II. Which part? The beginning, the end, the middle? - She's nervous! - Of course. Come on Sagodi! You're next! Go on! - So, the Ancient Greeks. - The Ancient Greeks. - May I begin? - Yes. In the 5th century B.C. there were bigger social changes in Athens than in the other eastern countries. The main cause of this difference was faster development... Kigler! Come here! It's the second from the right. - He picked "Prehistoric Communities"! - Lucky bastard! - Are you nervous? - A little. - Where did you get that? - Found it. It's like a pyramid. If you look into it you'll pick "Egypt". Sure. - Did you really like it? - I can't give you a better grade than an "A". Excuse me, sir. The trick is that you have to think of it as a game. Like a quiz show. If you think about it like that then it's a smooth ride. Ancient Egypt. That's how it works. Got it? - Well, do you? - Yeah. I passed. C. I picked "The French Revolution". I'll stay here with the others for a while. I'll help you study in the summer. Me too. Look, at least you passed math! - Do you like my eyes? - Yeah. They're like a molded croissant. Have a beer and forget about it! Don't give one to her, she's not a graduated adult! Just leave her alone! Whoever fails can't drink. Don't get mad at me. You're a jerk, Kigler! I won't hit you because it's against my principles! - Let's drink to your principles then. - Drink this one too! Zsofi, you coming? Is everything a joke to you? Don't go now! We can't drink six beers! Of course we can! Check this out! We'll meet later. You're a fucking moron! How so? Well, how do you like it? How did you find out? I guessed. Aren't you happy? Of course I'm happy. Did you call Kigler's dad? - It's stuck! - Give it to me. - A top notch Soviet car. - Get in! Slow down! - Did you have a drink? - No I didn't! Alright. - Where shall I take the lady? - "The lady"? "The old woman", you mean! This's Petya's car! Let's fucking push it into the Danube! Leave it! My dad got it for him. Cool, isn't it? Yeah. But not for me. - Do we really want to go in? - Sure! You can't come in, you know that? Come on! You won't let me in to my own prom? You can come in, but not them. So this is your thanks for the test questions, nerd? This is a private party. Then he's my mother and he's my father. Alright? You told me we can bring our parents with us. - Do you feel cold, honey? - Leave the kid alone! - When will you get there? - In about a day. - Good evening, sir! - Good evening. It's bigger on bigger ships. I wanted to tell you so much more. Tell me what? Hey I've been fucking looking for you! I heard you got the new car! - I'm going inside for a bit. - OK. You can thank my dad, you know that. Thought so. Royal's here. He took care of Sagodi for us! Drink! What's going on, boys? Dry just like that? You're a prick, my boy! The anwser is... you have to go to her. I don't like this music. Neither do I. But it doesn't matter. - Sagodi! - Yes, sir? Leave us alone. That thing you told me last time about the civil democracy was very interesting. My father and I often talk about it at home. - Give my kind regards to your father. - I will. - Think about Egypt! - I will. - You are both inhuman. - So what? You have to fix it. I finally got rid of it, but now you bring it back like this? I'll fuck around with it for months! Your dad will mutilate me! Months? You need to be done with it by next week! - It'll be expensive. - How much? At least 50,000. - You'll get it, don't worry! - Maybe more. It can't be more. We sold it for 40,000. I'll show it to Sanyi. He'll check it out. - Today! - Sure. You want me to give blood too? - I give you 5,000. OK? - Alright. - How much have you got? - 1,000. I give you 2,000 now and another 3,000 tomorrow. Keep your mouth shut in front of your dad! Don't fucking talk to me like that, or you'll get fired! Got it? That's it. We quit! - Did you hear that? - Yeah. - You need it for that shitty car? - Yeah, I need 100,000. - And you? - I don't want to get busted. - Are you a pussy? - Don't fuck around with us! We worked hard for that money. - How much is their part? - 40,000 each. - Should I give it to them? - Fuck that. We show you the big business but you let me down 'cause of a car? Just do it! Have a nice summer! - Where are you going, exactly? - Lake Balaton. The train goes there. You don't have to go by car. We're not. Hey. Where's your car? In Kigler's garage. - They let me leave it there. - How nice of them. - We're going to them. - Do they have a weekend house too? They bought it last spring. - Do they have a phone there? - No. I'll call you from a phonebooth. - Do you have money? - Yeah. - Wait a minute! - Hurry up! - Here's 500. - Thanks. Watch out for yourself! No problem. - Hello. - I've been looking for you. - You need your notes back? - No. I have to go or I'll miss my train. - Where are you going? - Lake Balaton. Look, I seriously need a train ticket. That's impossible. We shut down. - But you were doing it last week! - A lot of people got busted. We had to stop. - Could you get me one, somehow? - Where do you want to go? - Paris. - Zsofi called you? No. Her parents gave me her number. It's impossible. I'm sorry. There's the bus! - I'm sure you have one somewhere! - No! - Look for Royal. We quit. - But I don't know them! Somebody else, then. I made it into law school. - Congratulations. - Thanks. They're taking me into the army! Evening Post! Incredible news! Special edition! - Where's my passport? - Look for it on the train! Janos Kadar has died! - Is this the train to Vienna? - Yes. Get on! Thanks, chief! That was close. - We don't have the tickets. - You didn't fill them out, you idiot? I didn't know the destination. - Check out where he is. - He's at the end of the car. Hurry up! - Destination? Amsterdam? - Of course. Didn't we agree? - He's almost here! Three booths away! - Calm down. He's right here, put it away! Done. - Good day! - Good day! - Two of you? - Yes. Nice jump, back there. Lucky. - Where are you going? "Amrestad"? - Amsterdam, yeah. They sit on their asses in that office all day long but they can't fill out a ticket properly. You'll have to transfer at Vienna. That's a two-hour long wait. - Have a nice trip! - Thanks! Bye! If the first one falls for it the others won't check. Look at that! I'm going crazy! - They're watching us. - Over there too. I'm shitting myself. Wilkommen in Wien. Two stunde is ten shillings. Here it is. Hold it. - Got my "stealing coat"! - Come on! Never come to Vienna without it! This will open up after two hours. After that, anyone can pinch our stuff. We'll be here. Relax! Don't stop everywhere! Is this the west? - You've never been to Vienna? - No, why? Then we should go to Maria Hilfer! - What are you doing, you fool? - I begged you not to do that! You can transport it top-side-up only! - Hello. Bon appetit! - Thank you, my dear. - What are you talking yout? - It'll break, you idiot! - But the backpack's full of food! - I don't care! I'm going in. - We'll miss the train! - We won't. Check this out! I took everything! You're nuts! Let's get out of here! - No one's watching. I'm going back in. - No you aren't! - Yes I am! - We'll miss the train! There's loads of cassettes and other stuff! Yes, I said 319-427. Janos Kigler. Yes, I'll hold. Hello uncle Jancsi. It's Petya. Actually, we're in Vienna. Yes, Vienna. Gabi's with me. I mean, he's not here right now because we had some trouble. We were in a store and he stole some things and got arrested by the police. You have to come here because I can't get him out. He'll stay in custody anyway. I'll give you the address: 17 Sperrgasse. Two R's, two S's. Sperrgasse, yes. His bags are at "Lost and Found". I have to go now. I can't stay. Yes, I know we're stupid and everything. I'll tell you everything later. Thank you. Bye. Hello. - Do you speak Hungarian? - Yes. - I have this address and... - You're looking for Zsofi? Yes. She'll be back in a minute. She's at the laundromat. - Is it far from here? - No, it's on the next street. You can come in for now. - What's wrong? - I'll find her. Bye! - You'll miss each other! - I'll find her! At least leave your backpack! Thank you! Awesome. She's at her boyfriend's. - This looks nice enough. - Yeah. - Wine? - No. Look! We were there just this night! I'm sure Alain Delon would be having a cigarette just about now, I tried to call my grandma. I was a prick, obviously. My teacher was right. I couldn't understand why she wouldn't answer the fucking phone. Any kind of noise wakes her up. What if Kigler's dad had called and she found out that we're not at Lake Balaton? Then I thought: she probably went swimming. Poor grandma never found out that I crashed that shitty Zhiguli. One day she dropped dead at the market. It felt bad when Kigler didn't show up at the funeral. That bastard ate a huge amount of chicken. I heard he became a bigshot. He's running some sort of car rental business. Csomor told me that. I see him every now and then. He's got a pub few blocks away. Pretty good place. He adds water to the beer, but at least it's cheap. Royal got into some kind of trouble three years ago. He refuses to tell me what happened exactly. I know that they had to remove one of Royal's kidneys. The Serbs kicked his ass so hard that the doctors were barely able to patch him up. Supposedly he's alright now. Currently, he's not on drugs and has a girlfriend. What else would he need? Dr. Sagodi successfully completed college then went to the US. I heard he came back last year but he didn't like the atmosphere and went back to Oregon to work as an assistant lecturer. Zsofi dated some sort of 40-year-old anthropologist during her college years. Supposedly he married her but something must've went wrong because now she's back again. I saw her a few times on TV. I didn't recognize her because her hair's blond now. She looks pretty scary. She's living a good life working as a PR manager or something like that. What about me? Nothing. Actually I'm fucking hungry. I'm gonna eat a mad cow burger with some fries at McDonald's. It may rot my brain but at least no sauerkraut is in it.
