- Look ! Over there. - It's there ! Look ! The landing gear opened. Look ! Let's go ! Amir, I can't see. How many wheels on a plane ? Let me see. - Four. - No, you're wrong. Some have more, some have less. - These are for you, brother. - Thank you, sister. We saved these two for a rainy day. Please don't let my husband find out. - Why not ? - It'll upset him. Why ? Am I stealing ? - You're helping out your brother. - You're right, but you know him. This is how he is. Have I ever asked for help ? And I've helped you anyway I could. Didn't I find him the job he has now ? So my sister wants to lend me two gold coins. She has to hide it from her husband ? I don't accept this. Don't say this, brother. That's just how he is. It's not personal. The coins were sitting in my drawer. Sell them and solve your problems. God willing you'll be on your feet soon and you'll pay back the two coins. I'm worried he might make a fuss. Just don't mention it to him. Hello, Ghasem. How are you ? What are the Khomeini coins selling for ? - Hello, my friend. - Salam, Ali. - Hello, hello. - Hello. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Is Mr. Zakeri in ? - He's with the boss. - How are things, Ali ? - Thanks. - Hello, Mr. Zakeri. - Hello, Ali. How are you ? Fine, thanks. Come in. Well ? That's fine. The second part is still on the ship. Customs will okay it. Hold on a second. Yes, Ali ? Can you talk for a bit ? About a loan for a car. - Did you get the money together ? - I just need this loan. - Get back to work, I'll be there. - Thanks. Excuse me. - Please, sit. - No, thank you. - So, you got all the money ? - Yes, sir, with the company's loan. - Did you pick out a car ? - It belongs to an old friend. We used to work together. Here's a copy of the certificate. He gave me a discount and I can give him more later. - Is your son happy ? - Thank you, he will be very happy. - He has a good dad. - You're too kind. How was your own dad ? Come pick up your check in one hour. Hi, Hamid. How are you ? I called to tell you that I have the money. Thanks. Whenever is good for you. Okay, okay. I'll be at your brother's shop in the morning. - Hi. - Hello. - You okay ? - Yes, thanks. Good-bye. What's new ? Hey, Amir ! Answer me. I have great news. We will buy the car that I promised in the morning. - The red one ? - Yes ! Yay ! Don't eat too fast ! Slowly. Don't spill it. - Come on. - I'm coming. - I'm going to squish you. - Let me be ! - Should I ? - You made me ketchup ! Help ! Help ! First up, then down. Good, good. Spit. Now rinse your toothbrush. Hand it over. Give it to me so we can sleep. It's time for a lullaby. - Ouch ! - What happened ? Nothing. Push this. - This is our turn. - Where does it come from ? Inside the machine. - Do you want cash ? - I want to cash a check. What is check ? My name is here. I show it to them, and they give me money. - To me, too ? - You have to work to make money. - Did you work ? - Every day, all day long. Are you rich ? Not very. But I have enough to buy my son a cool car. Who gave you money ? My boss was happy with my work and he loaned me this. - What is loan ? - Loan means I have to pay it back. - To your boss ? - No, the company. It's their money. - Isn't your boss from the company ? - No, he works for his boss. - Aren't you a boss ? - I... No, I'm not. But maybe one day. I'm going to hide this so Mr. Robber doesn't find it. - Mr. Robber ? - Yes, Mr. Robber. - Is he here ? - He's everywhere. - Where ? - We don't know. - He can look like regular people. - I'm afraid. Don't be. I'm here. After you. Do you like your car ? Yes. Don't blow the horn. It's wrong ! Wait for me right here. Don't touch anything. They made ten. Right, ten. Hello, sir. I'm on the line. - How've you been, Ali ? - Fine. I told them yesterday. I told them myself. I told them myself yesterday. He's lying. Be quiet. Silence. I told him the price yesterday. Stop confusing things. He is lying. I'm telling you he is a liar. He's conning you. Amir, I told you no beeping ! - Why is that man shouting ? - Forget him. Let's race. Are you ready ? Start it. You want to do this right away ? It's a race. See what you did ! Driver of the red hatchback, out of the car ! Oh, my god ! The cops are coming. - What should we do ? - Hide. Get down ! I'll deposit it. - Have a sweet. - Thanks. Is this a bad time ? When is your brother coming ? - Hamid ? - Yes. - He's not coming in today. - Are you sure ? We spoke yesterday and decided I would come today and buy his car. Listen, Ali. You know the dollar is going up. The country is falling apart. Prices have tripled overnight. My brother can't sell you his car at this price. Think about another car. But we had a deal. I took out a loan. I borrowed a lot of money. Nothing has changed. Find another car you can afford. But Hamid said I could pay a portion of money later. Besides my loan agreement states the car must be less than ten years old. And Amir loves the red hatchback. These are not reasons for my brother to lose money. He said something and now he takes it back. The sky hasn't fallen down. But he's an adult. Because of what he said, I promised my son. I borrowed a lot of money. Here is the document and the key. Go and take it. But the price is not what you say, Ali. We took it for an appraisal. An expert put a price on it. He knew my situation and gave me a discount. And said I could pay some later. If he's not happy, I will find a way to pay the rest of the money. Right, but this price is from ten days ago. Do you know how much the market has changed ? How much has the dollar gone up since last night ? I spoke to him yesterday. He didn't mention these things. Listen ! He's too shy. I know these things. He doesn't agree with this price now. Tell me ! Do you want your friend to lose money ? If yes, then take it and go ! Key, document, and the car. Take it and go ! And keep your money ! - Get out, let's go. - What happened ? - We were supposed to drive home. - I'll tell you later. - What happened, dad ? - I'll explain. I bought these gloves last week for 15 Toman, today they cost 30. - I didn't think he would cheat us. - He is not a cheat. He went to sleep and woke up with the economy in ruins. But I promised my son. When this happens, it takes a few days for the market to settle down. Wait a bit, and I'll talk to him. We can agree on a new price. Something in between. I can barely pay what they asked for. You want your cake and eat it, too. Find a way to talk to him. Whatever he says, it will be my debt to him. But not to pay him right now. If I call him now, he won't budge. Wait a few days. With missiles of the revolution, the Zionist Regime is shakier than ever. Deputy commander of IRGC said "thousands of missile are ready to target the heart of Israel." More than 100 thousand missiles are ready to target immediately, and if the Zionist Regime repeats its past mistakes and attacks Lebanon... - What happened ? - I'll tell you. - Where is his backpack ? - I'll get it. Why aren't you coming ? Okay, okay. It's no problem. Don't upset yourself. You'll buy it for him soon. - I have to go. - When will I see you ? - I don't know. I'll call you. - Should I wait to see you later ? I don't know. It's passed 12 and I'm already late for work. Ali, don't stress yourself out. I'm just upset because I promised Amir. You talk as if Amir without a car... Good-bye. Next stop: Mahalati. - Hi. - Hi, Ali. - Hello, Mr. Zakari. - Hello, Ali. - Hello. - Hi, Ali. How are you ? I'm fine. Hello. How nice, Ali. Where did you park it ? - Park what ? - Your car. - How will we celebrate ? - That's on me, I promise. - What good is just a promise ? - The purchase didn't happen today. Why not ? They said the dollar has tripled so prices are up. The seller was a friend and he broke his word. In this situation he had to break his word. We had an agreement. That's why they say words are full of hot air. - You would have done the same. - No, my word over my head ! Ali, today we aren't the ones who decide. It's the dollar that decides. And what does it say ? It says, "No car now. You buy bicycle." Oh, your poor son has been waiting for this car. Maybe I can borrow some more money. - God willing, it will work out. - Thank you. But sir, I won't have enough money like this. It's far from enough. The company won't give more. They gave you the limit on your loan. Maybe you shouldn't buy a car now. Sir, you know I've promised my son. I don't want to break my promise. Listen to me... In this country all the big rats break their promises. You have your own place. You tried, it didn't happen. It wasn't your time. Why insist when you don't have the cash ? Amir is a child. He'll soon forget. Hello, sir. Amir is sleeping. Our Supreme Leader said negotiating with the U.S is poisonous for us as long as their attitude remains the same. Much like the words of Imam Khomeini. "Unless the U.S. stops being inhuman, it is venomous." And with this administration in charge, it's even more toxic. Amir... Get up. I made macaroni. Amir... It's dinner time. Thank you dear friends for listening to what we have said. We end tonight's discussion. Was Amir good in kindergarten ? He's been sleeping since we got here. I tried but he won't get up for dinner. Did he eat in kindergarten ? Did he vomit ? I'm worried about him. All he does is sleep. I don't know. Uproars of the Hoveyzeh missile shook the 40-year-old Revolution's enemies' hearts. This was an example of what our scientists can do for our defense. This product has special qualities. A limit of 13,000 kilometers or more. It can match the low flying cruise missile. - What happened ? - He's not feeling well. Let me see. My little angel. - He's not too warm. - He's had a fever all night. - You should go. I'll watch him. - No, I'll stay. No, I'm here for him. I called the company and took the day off. You can't just take days off. It looks bad. Don't you have to go back to the kindergarten ? I'll call and get a day off. I'll call you after the doctor sees him. Fine. This is his insurance book. Thank you. - Hello. - Hello, Ali. - How is Amir ? - Fine, thank god. - What was wrong ? - He had a fever. - Is he okay now ? - Yes, he's better. - What will we get for a bonus ? - I hope to god a gold coin. - No, way. Cash. - There's no tax on coins. - There is, but we don't see it. - That's good we can't see it. - Is Amir better ? - Yes, thank you. The office is not happy with your absences. I'm sorry. It was all about the car business. And today Amir got sick. - And the car ? - No news, yet. The company's loan was for the car. You'll have to give it back. No, I'll buy a car. Soon. There's a time for everything. You should pay back your debts. Whatever's left, put into dollars or gold. The rial is in free-fall. You fall asleep rich and wake up broke. I don't get these things. I can have a friend explain it to you. He exchanges money. My loan will be revoked. I don't want to buy a lemon. Okay, I'll wait. but how long ? Okay. Okay. Okay. - Hello. - Hello. How are you ? - What happened ? - Nothing. Tell me what's wrong. Is Amir okay ? Answer me. If I don't buy a car soon, I have to return the loan. I told you not to do it. You said Amir likes cars. You put yourself in debt. It's not a problem now. Just give back the loan. Ali... Life is short. Why fill it with stress ? I'm gonna tell the good fairy what a good boy you are, Amir. That you really want a car. What ? What kind of car ? Amir, the good fairy asks what kind of car ? A red hatchback. Good fairy, Amir wants a red hatchback. What ? You don't have a red hatchback ? What should we do ? Amir, the good fairy says she has a blue hatchback. Okay ? I don't want it. - No blue ? - No ! Good fairy, you have a magic wand. You can use it to change blue to red. Amir, she says she can do it but the car will get smaller. What do you want ? Red or big ? Red. Are you sure ? You can't change your mind. - Positive ? - Positive ! Well... And the fairy says, "Abra Cadabra !" Hooray ! Be careful, Amir. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Do you want some stew ? - No. - Salad ? - No. Lower the volume. Hello, brother. No, I'm at the kindergarten. One of the kids has a birthday and we're preparing for it. Ok, I'll come soon. Good-bye. He's happy. This will help him forget the hatchback. So far, he is enjoying it. Ali, pay off your debts so we can live together. This is not easy for me. - What happened ? - The car broke down. - Let me see. - Should I go ? Be patient, we'll go together. - Here you are. - Thanks. Let me know when you arrive. - Amir, get in, let's go. - I don't want it. - Why not ? - I just don't. Why not ? - You were going to explain. - I don't want it. Why not ? Why did Auntie Zohreh ask the fairy to make my car smaller ? She was joking. I got this from the store. - Keep it for yourself. - Fine, I'll keep it. - I'll drive it to work every day. - Liar ! If you could drive, you'd given Auntie Zohreh a ride home. Amir, I got this car to make you happy. I want a real car. I want us to drive together. And I wanted to buy you a real car. But I didn't have enough money. But you have a bank account. Get money from there. I can't just take money from the bank. I need to work and get a salary and then get money. So why did that lady give you money ? Because it was my money. Because I work for the company and they gave me money. Besides, if the dollar didn't go up, I would have bought the car. What's dollar ? American money. From another country. We have rials here. I don't want this. I want the red hatchback. They paint chickens and sell them as parrots. That's why they call it Devil's Bazaar. We might find a car you can afford. It's just luck. Who knows ? But we should be very careful. They sell damaged and repaired cars here. Let me talk to his brother. Ali, it's better to buy a car at full price than to get a discount on a damaged car. You'll pay double to the mechanics. You'll end up with a lemon. Just wait and I'll talk to him. I'll get him to settle with you. When did he sleep ? An hour ago. - Does he have a fever ? - I don't know. Let him sleep. I fed him. The President criticized the double standard of the West towards the Nuclear Deal. Referring to Europe's historical delusion, he said: Europeans see the U.S. as the world's chief, and for that they have not been able to make the right economic decisions for themselves... Thanks. You're welcome. Ali... Don't get upset, but... Go ahead. Are you mad at me for the advice I gave you ? Maybe you think I did it to be free of Amir. But I love him. Whatever I said was for him. I could have kept quiet. I thought it was better for him. If you want us to be together, never give such advice. Okay. Just one more thing... You're making this car issue too important. Why don't you take him out and have some fun ? What kind of fun ? I don't know. Whatever makes him happy. Right now only a car makes him happy. Where can I get one ? - Hey, guys ! He's here. - Finally. - Hello, sir. - Hello ! - Welcome. What's new ? - Hello, sir. - Hello. - How are you, sir ? - Is something wrong ? - What happened with our bonus ? That's why you're all smiling. Don't worry. The finance department gets their bonus last ? You won't lose anything. No rush. You'll get it. I have your bonuses here. And the day is over. I'll have Mr. Oveisi pass them out. Don't worry. Good-bye. Hi. My name is Ali. I am here on behalf of Miss Zohreh. - Hi. How are you ? How is Zohreh ? - She says hello. Wait a moment, please. - He is four, right ? - Yes. Four and half. - Thank you. Anything else ? - You're welcome. No. Bye. Wow, you are so handsome. Zohreh, I hope we don't get in trouble. What trouble ? I told you, a friend of a friend works there. Believe in yourself. Let me see you. Amir, wait ! Come on, come on. Do you want to check first ? Check what ? Don't worry. I set it up. Amir ! What are you doing ? Behave yourself. - How can I help you ? - Hello. - Hello. - Zohreh. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you Mrs. Johari ? - Yes. How can I help you ? - I am Azadeh's friend. - I've been waiting for you. - Thank you. - How can I help you ? We wanted to see SUVs. Dear, our cars are all crossovers. How much do you want to pay for your car ? Price is not an issue for us. What do you recommend ? Please come with me. Mr. Asari, these are my friends. Welcome to our store. This car has seven gears. Made in Germany. The interior includes electric seats with heating and a LCD monitor for watching cartoons. And most important of all is the sunroof. Test drive ! - You finally did it. - I did. - Which way ? - This way. No, that way. Ok, that way. - Come here, Amir. - Go up. Go up. Hands up. - Let's go. - Go where ? - Take the car and drive. - What do you mean ? - Let's go have fun. - You mean steal the car ? No, they have my ID. - The guy panicked. - He thought you'd hit him. Imagine me chasing him with a crowbar. Hello. What's wrong ? Why are you crying ? Don't cry. Just tell me. Alright. Thank you. Bye. - Just like I said. - What ? No one wants to sell. Everyone wants to buy. Sir, I am in trouble. I owe two coins to someone. He wants his coins. Can you please get me two ? From where ? There are no coins. - Be honest, are you undercover ? - Undercover what ? They've been arresting people left and right for two days. They want to control the market. They think they can control things with arrests ? Hey, man. I need two Khomeini's. I'll send him right over. - Did you want the two Khomeini's ? - Yes. - Do you have cash ? - I do. - But give me a little discount. - No discount. The price is what I said. And this price is for right now, it will change if you go and come back. I sold two coins a few days ago. A few days ? Prices change by the minute. What ? Do you want them ? You're not a buyer. Don't waste my time. Wait a second ! Yes, I got them. Don't worry. They're in my pocket. When I get off work, I'll bring them to you. No, I won't stay for dinner. I'm too tired to pick up Amir then come over. And I don't want to see your husband. I'll bring them to you this afternoon. Hold on. Hello. Yes, sir. I'll be right there. Yes. I have to go. See you soon. No sister, I'm not upset. Thank you. Bye. Most of the time, I am the last one who leaves. Especially on Thursdays. Everyone leaves and I stay to clean up. I usually lock the door myself. Who else has keys ? I don't know. Few people do. Did you find anything when you were leaving ? - Like what ? - Whatever. I didn't find anything. Then, where did you go ? I went to a friend's shop to pick up a package. What package ? A suit for a boy. Their boy is grown up. He didn't need it anymore. So, I took it for my son. - Then, where did you go ? - I went home. Where did you go after that ? I went to a car dealer with my son and my fiancée. Do you want to buy a car ? No, I wanted to buy one last week. But the prices suddenly went up. So, why did you go to a car dealer ? I took my son to see cars. He loves cars. Mr. Oveisi knows all of this. He knows me well. - Who is Oveisi ? - He is our financial manager. He is on a trip now. This floor is for our accountants. Why did you come late this morning ? I didn't have enough money to buy a car. That's why I borrowed two coins from someone. I planned to return them later. but they called this morning and wanted them back. So, I called the company and asked for an hour off. And I went to the Bazaar and bought these two coins. I wanted to give them back tonight. We need to ask you some questions at the police station. - Tell me what's going on. - It's nothing. Just come with us and answer a few questions. You can ask them here. I need a copy of your company's CCTV videos. Send them to police station for me. Can I put on my coat ? Write the name and the address of the person you bought the coins from. Why ? Is there a problem ? - Don't you know ? - I swear to god I don't know. Eleven gold coins are missing. They were for your co-workers' bonus. Where are they missing from ? From your boss's room. On his table. There are cameras in there. Please check the cameras. We will. Now write. Look at me. - Hello. - Hello. Is this the person who sold you the coins ? Yes, that's him. This man introduced me to someone in the mall. Near his shop. He sold me the two coins. What did you do with the other coins ? Did you sell them ? What coins ? I swear I borrowed two gold coins from my sister. She called in the morning and asked me for the coins. I went to the bazaar and bought two. After work I'm going to take them to her. Call her and ask her. Did you buy the coins with your bank card or cash ? He asked for cash. This man says he's never seen you. I bought two gold coins from him this morning. Maybe he forgot. Did you get a receipt or something ? No. I'm sending you to the court. Call your family and have them bring bail for you. You'll need it. If not, they'll keep you. I didn't do anything. I swear I'm not a thief. I'm an inspector, I gather facts. The rest is up to the judges. How are you ? My cell phone is acting up. This is the company's number. Listen, I have to go away for a few days. Can you watch Amir ? No more than four days. It's a company trip. I'm not sure where. I have to go because it pays well. You'll watch him, right ? I'll call you. No, I'm fine. Okay. I have to go now. Bye. Is your sister the only witness ? Yes. Only she knows. One woman's statement is not acceptable. What about her husband ? It was just my sister and I. Why don't they check the CCTV ? It will be clear. Can you get bail ? No. Is there anyone who can vouch for you ? - No. - No. All I can do for you is not to send you to jail. I can ask for more investigation. They will keep you at the station tonight. Get your bail ready by tomorrow. Signature and index finger. Company representative. Take off your shoes. Wait right here. Hello, sir. They'll call you. Thanks for the bail. You're welcome. Mr. Oveisi, would you tell me the truth ? If I know it, yes. If they're telling the truth and the CCTV have been checked, then why did they arrest me ? The cameras have been off for two weeks. I knew that they were all lying. The officer kept talking about CCTV. They wanted to scare you into confessing. I'm not a thief. - Hello, sir. - Hello. I spoke to the manager. He believes that you must be fired. He is willing to not press charges only if you pay back all you took. Why should I pay back for something I didn't steal ? I know you didn't do it. But this is what is being said. I told him I know you well. I know you are honest. I gave our boss a suggestion. But first you must agree. Everyone here thinks I'm a thief. - It's best I leave. - Who ? Everyone is on your side. My friend... Even if you pay back the coins so you don't go to jail, what will you do without work reference and with felony record ? Who will hire you ? You still owe the company for the loan. And the missing coins are more than a few. And if you lose your job... what will Amir do ? Write the director a letter. Tell him you needed the money. When you saw the coins, you thought they could solve your problems. But then you regretted what you did. Ask for forgiveness. Ask that the missing coins be treated as a loan. You can pay it back from your salary. You write the letter, I'll do the rest. - But I'm not a thief. - Listen to me, Ali. If you don't do this, you'll be fired and end up in jail. This way you can be free and take care of your son. You mean I should accept that I stole the coins ? The sun won't stay behind the clouds forever. One day the real thief will be found. I'll start looking for the real thief tomorrow. I'll find him. I just need time. Ali... This is all for your child. You do what you think is right. You have until tomorrow to decide. Hello, Ali. Hello. Are you okay ? Could you not smoke here ? We're all upset because we know you're innocent. But we don't know what to do and how to help you. Ali, the director has asked for all your keys. I'll turn them in. Also, yesterday a woman came in with your son to ask about you. She said she was your fiancé. She thought you had been sent out of town. She asked where you were. We had to tell her the truth. And you should call your sister. She's been calling for two days. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Amir, come get dressed. I'll call him and say that you gave me the coins. I'm sorry, brother. He thought I was lying. - Stay for dinner. - I don't want to face him. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know what happens. I'm really worried about you. Daddy, carry me. - Hello, brother-in-law. - Ali ! What salutations ? Why do you sneak in and then sneak out ? Forgive me, I'm a bit busy. I need to go now. We waited for you last night. Your sister cooked a big meal. - Sorry I couldn't make it. - Well, it's not just that one night. You've sneaking around for a while now. What gives ? You secretly come. Secretly take. You thieving around. You bastard ! Are you calling me a thief ? Shut it, you piece of shit ! Like I don't know you stole my coins ! You son-of-a-bitch ! You want me to beat you in front of your child ? Get lost ! Did I say you did it ? If you want to help me, find the real thief. How ? Should we line everyone up and ask them ? This is how you lose trust. Our financial department will be known as a den of thieves. Why don't you get what's good for you ? Like lying about being guilty ? Did I say you were guilty ? I want to get this over with. By ruining my reputation. Come in. With permission. I am not a thief. It's one of you. You find him. I will not sign anything. My friend... think about your son Amir. If something happens to you, what will happen to your son ? It's up to me. Go out that door and you're on your own. - Hello. I'll bring Amir now. - I can't take him now. - Is Zohreh here ? - Yes. Can you call her for me ? I didn't think you were a thief. I got upset because you lied to me. You could have told me on the phone. You could have explained. I've been thinking. I've changed my mind. About that suggestion... I want him to be away from here. I don't know. I'll ask. I said I don't know them very well. I want to make sure they're good people. Maybe they'll pick a different kid. Are you sure ? Yes, I'm sure. Ali, we can solve everything. We can make it work. We can help each other. No, it's better if he leaves. Look, they are not very young. No, they're not. Enlarge the photo. - Why ? - Do you think they're good people ? - They look kind. - You can tell from a photo ? Up to a point. Look at their shoes. Look at their clothes. Are they at the Caspian Sea ? The Caspian ? It's abroad. He'll have a lot of fun there. Now sit up straight. Very good. Okay. Big smile. Amir, are you ready ? Smile ! Smile ! Come on, smile. Amir, smile ! Let's see your smile. Hurry. - Will you smile ? - Amir, smile ! - One, two, three. - Amir, smile ! Smile ! Amir. Perfect. One, two, three. Amir. Very good. One, two, three. Perfect. One, two, three. THE RED HATCHBACK
