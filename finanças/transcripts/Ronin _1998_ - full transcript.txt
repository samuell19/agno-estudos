Hang on, please. Excuse me, sir. Are you Sam? A phone call for you. -Is everything ready, Jean-Pierre? -Yes, everything. He's tough, your Yank. You're right about that. But who is he? That's not important. Didn't he work for the CIA? He used to. Not anymore? He's on the run. You're sure? I know what he can do. I've seen him. Why would he carve himself up if he were still CIA? He makes a phone call, and it's taken care of. And you? How have you been? We need some information. We need to find some people in Paris. Who? An Irish man and woman... and a German, ex-KGB. They're professionals. And they're in hiding. This is really important to you? He saved my life. I'll find them for you.
