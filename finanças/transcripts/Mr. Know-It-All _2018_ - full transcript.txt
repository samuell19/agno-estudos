MR. MĄDRALIŃSKI Good morning Mr. Wang. Great. And you I was just going to call you. Well. I will check emails. After signing the contract. I will be in Beijing in a month. I've already packed my suitcase. There is no Mrs. Barteau or children. I will come alone. I'm learning. Have a nice day. "Good morning"... "Goodbye"... "My name is Vincent"... "The match is at 15:00. "What position do you play on?". Hassle. "The nearest night club?" Hello coach Wider! You are lost. More passes! Talk to yourself. Relax, Cheriff! Kevin will catch Hollywood. I barely brushed it. - You fight every time. - No. - What am I telling you? - Let me defend cleanly. There is a card and a penalty kick at the match. Especially when you find Kevin. Kevin! Get up! I would put yellow on you for pretending. Three laps of the pitch! Move on! Lilian, go to the corner. Run, not walk! - Comedian. - Shoot, Lilian! Daniel! - Saubade. Doctor. - I am pleased to. Vincent Barteau. I know. The office is asking for your medical certificate. This year I missed the study. Do we check it out after training? Okay. Take a deep breath. Again. Zakasłać. Fine. - A young lady. - I finished my internship in October. So this replacement? First job. Andrieux has retired. - Weren't you saying goodbye? - I'm not party. And what? Ambitious. He still carries me somewhere. Where are you going now? Far. It is a pity that I was not at this goodbye. - I'd drive you away. - I would refuse. - married woman? - No. - So I'm not your type? - Please take your pants off. Perfectly. Yeah... Did a player make a coach? The final of the French Cup 2009. Bordeaux-Paris. Double tibia fracture, end of career. But the worst... that we lost 2: 0. - Yours or mine? - You gotta be kidding me. Have you seen a new doctor? You fell in love too? - The league is too high for us. - I asked if you saw her. For nothing more. I have seen. You too. Everyone saw it. Let's go. We're going to Fabien Lambert, 13, goalkeeper, very lively and great in its position. I called you this weekend. I had a job. Have you trained food with chopsticks? That's my job, Vincent. I need to know what who is doing and especially how fast. I figured you out when I put you in our villa. You left your suitcase open. When will you tell the kids? When I sign the contract. - Mr. Barteau? - In my own person. I'm calling from the Royan hospital about your mother. Mr. Vincent, a footballer? Picard. I operated on your mother. Bypass implantation succeeded. Your dad was with us three years ago. The whole city was jumping around him. Mayor, mayor's wife... An extraordinary man. Supposedly. - Were you abroad then? - No. Just before anesthesia, my mother had a fit. She said over and over again, "Leo stayed home... Leo is alone. " The marriage is dealt with by the property. - So you know Lea? - No. This seemed like a big worry. Anyway for her. Is anybody at home? Antonio? Lidia? Vincent? I'm in the office. Hello Vincent. I have not seen you in a long time. I'm glad you're back. Nothing and you've put on weight. Lidia keeps you on a diet? Where is he She went to the supermarket to get cereal bars. - Are there still chickens? - No... it's Leonard. Give me that. I passed a boy running like crazy. This is Leo. Where did he come from - This is your nephew, son Pauline. - Pauline? Born child? - You know the sister. It's a bit... - Crazy? - I didn't say that. - I do. - Where is he now? - I have no idea. She was in Guatemala three months ago. Sometimes he falls for a few days and goes away again. Your mother is your legal guardian since he was three years old. Vincent... We need your help. Leonard has a reserved place in the dormitory, but only in 2 weeks. Since your mother isn't here, it's a problem for us. - Take somebody to help. - We can not. Leonard is afraid of everything he does not know. Family is different. Maybe... - I haven't belonged to her for a long time. - He sleeps in your room, and you take care of children. - One more or less... - They are not children. Footballers. And if he is as crazy as his mother... This is Leonard. 77. Nice hut, huh? I built it myself. Do not take it personally, it's complicated family matters. I'm sorry. 77. - What? - 77. 77 what? 77... - Stones, dandelions, butterflies? - 77. Department no. Seine-et-Marne. Antonio... What does he mean with 77? He kept saying that. 77? I have no idea, he likes numbers. But I don't know what that means. When he gets tired, he falls asleep. All in all, he is not a difficult child. As I say no, no. - Come take a bath, water is great! - Are you annoyed by our presence? You don't like surprises? See! All right, girls... Champagne! Vincent! - Yes? - Some brat is staring! What? With a backpack, he's just gone. Who? Where? Do you have a kid Open the bottle. Good evening, Vincente. Late time, but it's hard. - Come in, little one. - Wait a second! His name is Barteau, not Jimenz. Just like you, so cope. My mother lost her health and now Antonio loses it. I'm taking him to Spain to regain his strength. - I can't, I have my life. - We all have them! What did you think? I'll come for him in 2 weeks. Keep your head up, Vincente. We're boring here. - That strange son of yours. - Not mine, I met him today. We're going to "Oxford". Drop by if you are bored with the role of a nanny. Hello daddy What are you doing with this bed? I set them according to the rotation of the Earth. One in 88000 seconds - They told you... - It improves the quality of sleep. - Are you listening to me? - Will we play? What? No, it's late. 22:04. Shall we play? - I was doing something! - Are you afraid to lose? - I hate chess. - That's what adults say when they're afraid. - Do you have any answer? - I always tell the truth. At 9:00 we are going to the stadium. On time. - I'll stay in my room. - No. You do not trust me? I do not trust. - You don't trust Leo? - I tell the truth too. What are you doing here? You said "at 9:00". It's 9:04. - I'm not ready. - It had to be said at 9:10 or 9:15. Let's be accurate. - Have you had breakfast? - I have my cereal bars. - Is that what you eat? - 15% calcium, 20% magnesium 30 percent B12 and 35% barley. I'll take my things. Count down 9 min and 15 seconds. Come. - What will I do? - Look from the grandstand. - They're boys your age. - Naguski gone? - Did they stay in your room? - Not your thing. - Are you mad at me? - No. - Grandma says... - Little, I'll explain one thing to you. Look at me... No conversations about my family and my private life, okay? Very bright. 77. - 78, 79, 80. I can also speak in code. - It's not a code. Enough, because I'll put you on the first train! - On the other hand. - Leo to the first train... Leo to the first train... Keep the pace, boys. Leaning forward! We breathe deeply, hands loose. Smile! It's for your own good, believe me because there will be crying when accelerating. Can you hear that, Cherif? - It's hard. - It will be harder. Moves! - What boy is this? - Don't be so curious. And how to ask you something, you don't know. He just waved off. Cholera. Holy shit... Cherif, keep track of time. Then 5 laps of the pitch. - Up to 5 ?! It's an inflection. - Right, 10. Leo? Oh no... I was looking for you! Come back to the grandstand and wait there. We have made friends. He told me about your family. It means? That you know each other poorly. - That's good. - Are you worried about something? No what? - That's your face. - Do you want to measure my heart rate? He asked about my occupation and said he was taking Medanon. It is a strong drug for ADHD disorders. Leo has ADHD? I do not think so So it's alright, have a nice day. Thank you Second post, not the fourth! I remind you that the gate is there. Tonio, very stylish! Move it, boys! Ball high! Defense, take it over! Oh no! Stop tonie! Take a shower! Mathieu, go to the goal! Omar, Camara, Kevin... With life, boys! 77, we're going. Did you watch the match before you fell asleep? - You will not say anything? - I was supposed to be quiet. I ask, so answer. You won't like it. Your opinion about football? On the contrary, I'm curious. - Aren't you angry? - Talk. This is a crude game. And you are angry. Resentful. No, you're right, they are beginner players. - I watched the matches of the first league. - Real football is famous clubs: Barcelona, ​​Real, Manchester. No difference, the possibilities are limited. - "Limited"? - Yes. Wait here a moment. I'm getting tired of him. Wait! Right, you better come in. Hammer her from the left. Pretty. From 3 hours are you watching the same match, you don't have enough? Because i... Don't stay long. - When I'm tired... - You fall asleep, I know. Hey! I will make coffee: 70 percent Arabica, 30% Robusta. Want? Coffee is annoying and Vincent is already angry... And what? Do you still think football is coarse? Yes. Real, Barcelona... can't you see the difference? Combination game is faster but predictable. You wouldn't say that if you were a footballer. On the pitch it's much harder. Not according to me. No. 9 is a bishop, 7 is a jumper. 9 runs diagonally, 7 to the center and passes to 9. 9 shoots at the goal or exchanges the ball with 7 and shoots. To the left corner when she has it on her right leg. Left top game. - Football is like chess? - Simplified. Grandpa said that chess is the queen of games and thanks to it you can beat everyone in other games. - He taught you to play? - Yes... - modesty too? - Modesty is not. Say well, Mr. Mądraliński... if you played on the field, in what position? In goal. To defend the line. - Look at this freak. - He has longer arms than his legs. Leo, to the goal. Tonio, on the bench. Leo will replace you. Give your best. Fasten gloves. One blow to the right wing, triangle play, one pass and one shot. Simple boys. - How many matches did he play? - 77. Hurry up. Player 7 on b5, ball on d3, Leo on g1. Player 7 on b5, ball on d3, Leo on g1. Ball on d3, Leo on g1. Player 7 on b5, ball on d3, Leo on g1... Focus, damn it! Player 9 on h4, ball on d3, Leo on g2. Player 9 on h4, ball on d3, Leo on g2. Player 9 on h4, ball on d3... It's not a video game or kindergarten I would stick her with my eyes closed! Focus! - He has football in his genes. - Just fart. - You reacted strangely. - Normally. Stop! - Enough! What is? - Your nephew says worse things than smudges. - Calm! - Does it piss you off because it's better? Daniel, help me! Wyhamujcie. - And where to? - Guys, enough... Leo, what's up? Show. - Come back to the pitch. - What happened? He offended someone, they beat each other and hit the post. - Bleeding. - It's nothing, don't interfere. And let me do the right thing. Attention, it will tweak a little. - Do you feel anything? - No... - What if I press a little? - No... - What did you tell him? - Truth. I always tell the truth. Can I ask you 2 or 3 questions? Three questions. I agree, 3 questions. - Knee better? - Great, doctor. - But it hurts here. - Kevin always moans. Do you have a fever - Is this your new girlfriend? - Enough, guys. - They're cool. - uncomplicated. Once again, boys. Leo is sleeping in my office. Faster, engage your thigh muscles more! Can we talk for a moment? Boys, that's enough for today. Clean up the equipment, 1.5 hours of running tomorrow. Thanks. - Have you heard of Asperger's syndrome? - What is this? A light version of autism, no intellectual deficit. Disinfecting the hurt, did you manage to diagnose autism? I had experience in pediatric psychiatry. Analgesia, escaping with eyesight, above average intelligence... Finish, collect the stakes! - He's probably obsessive. - He keeps repeating "77" staring at his watch ... and playing chess. - Bobby Fischer had Asperger. - Who? Chess champion And Glenn Gould, pianist. Leo is like a Martian visiting Earth. Yes. He sees what the neurotype cannot see. - Do you know many words like that? - Neurotypic people. Normal people like you, I... Especially you. He considers football to be rude, but he watches matches and notes. He tries to get closer to you like that. Football is a chance for him. A closed world and rules that can embrace. - You're his signpost. - Oh no, I'm not his father. He came for a short time. - And then? - He's going to boarding school. What? How do I know?! Not my business! Please send him when he wakes up. - What did you tell Kevin? - He made the wrong decision. A feint in the penalty area is rarely effective, because the defender comes back or the place is gone. Did you tell him that? - really? - I really said that. - It hurts you? - Less than you. - It doesn't hurt me. - How did you break your leg? - You lay there and screamed. - The doctor told you? - And she gave you a spider? - To remember that appearances are deceptive. The black widow raises fear and is useful. Very intelligent. - Black Widow? - Doctor. And pretty. It is true. - Very pretty. - Yes. She is a very, very pretty woman. She has a nice face, a nice nose and a lot of grace. That's enough, Leo! Yes, she is pretty and graceful. See... It's good for breakfast. And this? Soft, tasty. Also not? Look, brioche. Kids like it. - What are you looking at? - For storage. Want to bake yourself? Take what you usually eat. Vincent? Good morning, it's mom. Good day. I feel better now and I'll be home soon. I need rest, but the doctor is of good cheer. It will only be an episode. Leo is doing well? Yes. - Do you want to talk to him? - gladly. Damn, he flew again. - I wanted to tell you... - You'll tell me later. Where did he take him again? He starts to piss me off. - Leave it, it's not a toy. - Weight shows badly. The little one is right - Thieves! - Please calm down... - Leo! - A great kid. He found that weight added 35 g each time. Nice racket! - Your son makes me a thief ?! - I'm 35, so it must be mine? - I'm eating lettuce, so I'm a turtle? - Have you lost it? We'll set something up. From now on you will eat normally - and stop lecturing everyone! - I do not lecture. - You messed up here and here! - But the weight... I don't care that customers pay for potatoes like truffles! The weight is wrong! Badly shows... It's okay, see... Your cereal bars. You're right, it shows wrong. - How's it going, honey? - I played soccer with Vincent. Good. Do you like football I have bad opponents in chess, but the players are great. You were right, grandma. If Vincent gets angry, it's powerful. But I learn a lot from him. I kiss you, honey. I kiss you too, grandma, bye. Put it there. Thanks, Leo. You don't have to play, you can stay in the room. - I want to play. - In a week, you're leaving. - I want to keep learning. - why? I like how my brain works. - Will you be good? Otherwise... - Leo to the first train. Just. Eat. - Damn! - Foul! Omar what are you doing? Penalty! Calm down. Camara, you deserve it, shoot him. In the middle of it. Penalty. Criminal... Stop it, guys... Leo! Damn what he Guys, break! You won't go this way. It was a joke, calm down. It's okay... Cool down. Please don't blame yourself. Really comforting! And this is supposed to be a chance? Yes. Any criminal will be a failure. I won't put him in it. - You don't understand how important this is. - Sure, I'm a dumb footballer. Above the ball, damn it! Do you know what is going on with aspergers in general? - Listen. - Possibility of finding oneself in society they hit once or never. Unused talent is disappearing. They are placed in centers or stay with their parents. And the light goes out. - Are you afraid, I know... - Castel, buy you new legs? Conquer her! This is Leonardo's world now. Prickly bushes! It doesn't reach you? The Lord pulled him out of them - Break, guys! Where have you gone, Leo? I still have to look for you! Where are you going? - To the stadium. - It's from 5 km. 5.25 km. My record is 14 km in an hour. - It's Sunday! - I'll watch the penalty shootout DVD. Do you think everything is on CDs? Did you get a little bone? I want to learn with you. I want to learn with you. Damn. - Get in. - To go where? To the stadium. And what? Do you still want to learn? - I understood. - For 5 penalties, a good goalkeeper can save 1. We'll be in touch. Take care, in a month you'll be back on the field. See you soon. - Someone's looking at us. - Don't be distracted. This is the doctor... Lady doctor I saved a penalty... Bravo! - Are we training? - I take overtime too. I've had enough. Will we sail to the island for oysters? They are great for circulation. And venus mussels. They have a lot of vitamin B12... What do you say - Welcome. Is there a reservation? - No. Three people I will lead you. Please sit down. Leo, what for you? What is wrong? - I sit in the restaurant by the window. - It's good that we have a table. - I sit by the window. - There was no other, it's crowded. - I want it by the window. Wait a minute, I'll handle it. It's good here too. You are tiring. - I sit by the window. - I understood! - Thank you. - Happy? - They didn't care. - Not at all, because it's a super table. - You took them over with yours... - What? You have such a way... Such a face like now. We order? Do not look like this. You know what I mean. I understand you. I always sat by the window in the university canteen. Uncle always puts the bag by the door on the right. - I do not see the connection. - And he has three toothbrushes. Red is hard, medium blue, but uses green. Do you think I pay attention to this? Where's the waiter? And a carafe with water? Sir - And going to the shower, takes off the bathrobe and... - Enough! This is his nice bathrobe. His robe is nice... Mathilde! Will we go - Do you come here often? - Each weekend. Have you never heard his laughter? Never. "You didn't see him when he was little?" - I didn't know it existed. What happened in the family? It was supposed to be a walk, not a psychoanalysis. I wanted to talk about Leo. He leaves in a week. So we wash our hands? Why give him hope? I explain to you all the time. - If you reason like that... - We avoid disappointment. Joy also bypasses us. I'll take a bath. - It's a cross. - Do you like spiders? My sister liked them. She drowned not far from here. I dreamed about you today. You stood on the shore with her in your arms. Rescued. Where's Mathilde? She came back home. Those naguski don't grow up to her heels. I already know what "77" is. My IQ. More passes! You noticed him, okay! Don't try, simple game. Okay, Cherif, shoot! - Who's that? - Barteau's nephew. Come on guys! One touch, I said. You go well Fight, Cherif. Fight boys till the end! Penalty! Make a good choice, Elliot. There will be a goal! Do not rush. Take a breath and wal. Have you seen? He won't let anyone pass. - You're a champ, man. - Thank you. Leo is a champion... He is good. When will your mother leave the hospital? - The management wants to have this little one. - Are you talking about my nephew? That's my job. - We need a good goalkeeper. - Comes in a week... to the autistic center. I doubt it will be at our psychologist's at 16:00. The club is ready to receive it from Wednesday. - I agreed with Dr. Saubade. - With Dr. Saubade? What are you playing? I know our psychologists. They consider him a tip, do you want that ?! You steamed without knocking and yelling? Please leave! I said! It can overcome disability and have a better life. - What if the test fails? - But why? Is Leo on the sailing boat the Leo, what's the arrival? Playing at the club is a great opportunity for him. Do you remember yourself? I told my father I wanted to be a professional footballer and he: "I agree, as you will be on your own." I was 16 years old! I took his Mercedes and never came back. Do you know what? You can speak, but you know nothing. Nothing and nothing. - Would you like to play football? - Yes. With Omar, Djibril, Bensaid... And with Kevin. He always has a nice hairstyle. Uses gel... You would have to pass a test with a psychologist, - to get a license. - Well. They want to assess how you are doing in a group. How do you endure aggressive behavior, unprotected criminal, etc. I understand perfectly. I will help you prepare to be calm. - I am. You are nervous. - Nonsense. You tap on the table. Please don't watch me for a moment. Do you see that you are tapping? Excuse me. This is my dream. I see that you were raised by your grandfather and grandmother... Grandfather and grandmother, my grandparents. Can you tell me something about dad? And about mom Vincent Barteau is also... your trainer... and uncle. 77. Is this a code? 77. Will you sit in the waiting room for a moment? I must admit that the matter raises doubts. It means? You are not married... No. You wrote, "occasional relationships." It's troublesome. You must sacrifice the tower. You must sacrifice her to win. Tower on h1... No, this way I will reveal the king - and I will get the mat in 3 moves. - Not if you do castling - and the queen will move to d7. - Great chess game. Almost like football. You intrigued me. Check. Checkmate. - And? Did it go wrong - Will write a positive opinion. Cool! And you have a sour face? I made it easy for him to win several times and he couldn't take advantage! Something horrible! He is a very bad chess player. It's nothing funny... Fantastic! You can play! We're not driving a car? - A new problem with the license? - Yes. Don't you want me to play anymore? You don't have a real match outfit. - Will I play in a real match? - I don't know, it's risky. Summit match, Atlantic Derby. Against Bordeaux. - Against the Bordeaux club? - I played there for 12 years. Last year they won the championship. - Want to play? - Yes. Leo on the goal against Bordeaux. - Hello how are you? - Well. - All right? - Cool. - Come on, Leo. - Hey! These are nice. Look, Leo. Look. - You can try it on. - This cool green. - There are a dressing room. - He goes there, he goes. You can wear it unbuttoned... I'll go get my pants. Do you like it unbuttoned? Pretty what? Pause for a moment. You have pants here. And I took out my shoes. Mathilde, this is Vincent. With the psychologist it went perfectly. Leo will play. We celebrate it tonight. You are invited, of course. Well, see you then. Vincent was saying. - I know one joke. - I like jokes. The mouse went to a psychiatrist. "Doctor, I fell in love with an elephant." "In male or female"? And the mouse: "Who do you have me for, doctor? I'm normal." - Do you like these jokes? - Those with the word 'normal'. This is your funny joke. - Can I whistle him? - To tell who? Little Chinese players will like it. Will they play in our club? No... I'm going to them. To the Chinese home? No, Leo... I'm going to China to train them. Such a profession Football coaches are constantly moving. As you play better and better, you will also change clubs. - Why didn't you say it before? - I didn't say because... There was some confusion in my life, I think you know. Are you going long For 2 years or maybe longer. What are they here? We decided to come back in the middle of the week, to avoid traffic congestion. Mainly because your mother left the hospital. I won't let Lea go, he has a match on Wednesday. Will he play... with your team? It means... Was. I'm leaving for China. What are you? Open the door! A joke again? You have a new outfit, they count on you, it's a great match! Do you hear? Look at me! Mathilde will come to celebrate it, stay for her. Do you really want to go back to grandma? We'll take him to Saint-Fraigne, let my grandmother regain strength. Did you hear? You're going to the resort! Don't you prefer to stay in La Rochelle with Mathilde and the guys? - I don't want to play anymore. - I can not hear! What are you saying? I prefer chess than football. She is the queen of games, grandpa was right. - Wait, Leo. - Leonard, say goodbye to your uncle! Does not matter. - He doesn't like to say hello or say goodbye. - But despite everything! You did well! Thank you, Vincente! It's great that you found time. - Please. - Nice to thank you. Did you start celebrating without me? - I opened the oysters. - Nice place, open space. Not like you. - A glass of champagne? - gladly. - Leo is at home? - He left. How is that They came for him, as agreed. Not my fault. All Leo. He wants to kick the ball, and in a moment he prefers to play chess at home. - And you didn't try... - What? I am not his father, nor will I be. I warned you that's it. We drink? I'd better go. Please stay. I have oysters, vitamin B12 great for circulation... - It's pathetic. - Whatever... You didn't just come to Lea. You were right, you are a dumb footballer. Camara, you're coming! Boys, take your seats! Castel, he is alone, damn it! Oh no! 500 GRAMS 535 GRAMS Keep your head up, guys. When I come back, you will be professionals. Even Kevin. Enough of these funeral mines! I will tell you a joke that I heard from a friend. Mouse at the psychiatrist: "Doctor, I fell in love with an elephant". "In male or female?" "Who do you think I am? I'm normal." Because the mouse loves an elephant. Male or female, it doesn't matter. Odd that elephant. It's a mouse and the elephant is... Never mind. Mr. Coach... When will Leo come back? I'm sorry... - Madam today, Maryse? - They asked for it at the club. Maryse? - Where did you find that? - In the living room, under the mattress. Thank you - Where's mom? - Upstairs, with Lidia. Good morning, Vincente. Good day. Will you leave us alone, Livio? It's you? Did you take him to the stadium? Sit down. Next to me. Leonard always liked to sleep in your room. In others he had nightmares. One day... he was 4 years old... went down for breakfast... in your football shirt. I don't know where he found her. You had to hide it well. When your dad saw him in it, he had a face - I won't forget it - as if he saw you. Since then, his schedule ... has changed strangely. On Saturday and sometimes on Sunday took Lea to escapades, whose purpose he hid well. But I guessed. They went to watch you play. They didn't miss any matches. He was a man... very secretive. Extremely. Like you. We don't always do the right thing. - We parents... - Come on. Your sister no longer lived here she preferred to live differently. And you... I wanted you so much to stay with me... I'm sorry, mom. I'll show you something. Leo not only had the ticket from your last match. He kept everything. Rescuers threw the protective pad to the side of the pitch. Leo was furious and dad had to go down and take it. Leo can get his way. He glued it 20 times... but it's falling apart. What? Thread... Such a small thing between him and me. When will you take him home? I don't know, it got a little complicated. Try to rest. He is not hurt at this center. It is no longer in Saint-Fraigne. One evening he got such a frenzy attack, that they had to take him to the hospital in La Rochelle. To the hospital? Psychiatric Marius Lacroix. Leo is at the tips ?! Let's get him out of there. - It's a good hospital... - Rest, I can handle it. Drive faster! Sorry, I'm looking for a patient, Leonard Barteau. What age is it? This is a teenager. Zoe! Is Leonard Barteau in Probst's ward? - You came for him. - We were not planning a discharge. I am his uncle, I will take him home. Patients don't go out like that. His grandmother and legal guardian will send the authorization. - Headmaster's consent needed. - Go and get him, please explain. - I can't disturb him. - We'll take care of this for a moment. Prefect's consent is also needed. Please, ma'am, it's important. - For 2 minutes. - I'll see what I can do. Mr. Barteau? Probst. Your nephew is my patient. You probably know the condition in which he was received here. - This is a misunderstanding, quite complicated. - He was extremely excited. We're now working to regain contact with him. It's a long and difficult process the patient is totally withdrawn. - He probably has schizophrenia. - No! Has Asperger. Are you a doctor Please bring him. I'll talk to him and he'll be in trouble. - You probably... - Can I or not, damn it ?! The family has the right to visit! "Given your nervousness, that's a bad idea." - Wait a minute! Please forgive me. I calmed down, can you see? I am calm... Please. - Your uncle came. - Hi, Leo. May 30, 2009, final of the French Cup. "Vincent Barteau and Ryan Cross, fighting for the ball, they collide violently. For one, it ends in a broken leg. They exclude the cross, and Barteau leaves the field on a stretcher among the applause... It was just... 77th minute of the match. 77. minute! 77... You see leo I already know, finally understood! 77th minute and 77... I came for you. Grandma feels a lot better, I'll take you to her. Do you hear what i say I'm taking you to grandma. Do you hear? I'm talking to you, wake up! We're going to grandma's. Do you hear or not To grandmother! Look at me! - Damn you, damn you! - Please don't insist. - I will, because he doesn't listen! - Will you leave? I'll take you to grandma! Look at me! Why is he not looking? I came for you! And let me go! What the hell did you do to him ?! IM going im going! Are you here It's Lea, we have to talk. - Excuse me, disturb? - No... I have friends, but please tell me. David! - Will you leave us alone for a moment? - Sure. She's in a psychiatric hospital. He didn't want to go with me. I don't even know if he met me. It is silted with ashes. According to the doctor, he is a schizophrenic! "Any trouble, Mathy?" - Wrong. But why did he get there? At the center he got a rage attack. You must tell them how it was. About our relationship, football. - The doctors will believe. - It's not so simple. Do you hear what I say ?! They turn off that light, damn it! - But there's trouble. - There is no! Please listen... I told you that you were a great opportunity for him. But I also warned you that you might be disappointed. Leo returned to his bubble. I understand. My fault yeah Does not matter. Have a nice evening, doctor. What did you actually want? Let me take care of him because you're leaving? Would you have a lighter conscience? I can not do that. Damn! Finally, realize that he loves this kid! Your trip is you, only you will turn off his light. And others also. Good night, Leo. I agree, but this is your last visit. You know my opinion. We did not observe any change in his behavior. Zoe... Take Mr. Barteau to his nephew. Good morning, Leo... I used your method. Statistics. For 10 trainers who go to China, most often for money... eight have fatal results, and even lose his job after a few months. Since I have little chance of success... I decided to stay here. With you. And because you stopped playing football... I'm learning to play chess. Detriment. Why? Because I decided to play only with good chess players. - And I'm not good? - Sure! How can you know Chess players have been studying for years. If you have a good teacher, you can spend less time. Do you have it I have his notebook. He gave it to me. In my opinion, he forgot. Ready? Yes. I will crush you. I know. You're angry again. I'm not angry anymore. I learned a lot from you. Text: Joanna Dębska
