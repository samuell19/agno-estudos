THE UNKNOWN SINGER Based on an Original Idea by Music by RENÉ SYLVIANO With Lyrics by SERGE VEBER Screenplay, Shooting Script and Dialogue Once again you'll see gay Paris Gay Paris Gay Paris The Eiffel Tower L'Opéra, Notre-Dame The boulevards With their beautiful ladies Once again you'll see gay Paris Gay Paris Gay Paris Nice and quiet, eh? Whoa, there! Give me the gramophone. Ladies and gentlemen. Hold on. Come closer. Appointed by the emperor of China... appointed by the People's Commissar, appointed by the great Parisian manufacturers, I present the latest innovations of the City of Light, purely as informational advertising. I will unveil before your eyes marvels upon marvels. Forgive me for my poor Russian. I do my best! Hold on. Sure, honey. I'm from Paris, to boot. Like that? Pretty, isn't it? If you're a good girl, you'll get a present. You look like a good girl. It's yours. Hold on. Ladies and gentlemen, it's my great pleasure to present some fancy goods from Paris. You've never been, but you've all heard of Paris. Hands off the phonograph, sir. Hands off. But first, ladies and gentlemen, hold on. A very serious item: the international fountain pen. It writes flawless Russian. No spelling mistakes. Made entirely of ebonite with a nib of the same metal. It works impressively well. Housewives, examine it closely. Here you are, sir. This is the item. It comes in a nice box with instructions. I'll wrap it for you. That'll be 15 francs. That's right. He understood perfectly. Now he can write his memoirs. And now, hold on, ladies and gentlemen, let's move on to jewelry. First, the luxury watch. A quality ticker, ruby jewel bearings, polished to a high sheen. The watch has golden edges which will never tarnish. As you see, it works all by itself. This watch - It even goes "coo-coo" by itself. Precisely. Take a look, sir. Here, listen, miss. Why not? Here, didn't I tell you? Here you are, sir. Rubles from the rube. Come, ladies and gentlemen. Who wants one? A lovely watch, sir? No? What about you, miss? Mustn't be late for your dates. Ladies and gentlemen - Don't leave the shop. I've just begun to sell. If you don't want watches, hold on. Ladies and gentlemen, to thank you for your kindness and generosity, good children and veterans, I'll play you a song. Step aside, cutie, you're blocking the orchestra. Soon delicate harmonies will rinse your ears. Here comes the music. You are my joy You are my life My most adored My sweetest support I have only one hope Only one desire That our great love Goes on forever When I'm far from you My heart is askew Everything seems sad and blue When I'm far from you The birds in the trees No longer sing so sweet I get angry over nothing Everything is so annoying When I'm far from you Life feels pale and blue Even roses seem less rosy Far from you - Perfumes are - - Less fine Colors lose their shine Life seems pale and wan When you are gone But when you reappear You chase... What's wrong, buddy? Keep singing. I can't remember it. - You're French? - Yes. Of course! I understand. Come with me, buddy. Over here. Allow me introduce myself: Ernest Bisé, king of peddlers. What are you doing here? I'm a fisherman. Sure, but with a voice like that, you used to be a singer, right? Have you been here long? A long time. You've got some strange ideas, buddy. Couldn't you fish somewhere else, like along the Seine? Excuse me. Do you need an interpreter? No, buddy. I speak Russian. Where are you from? I don't know. He can't remember anything. Ten years ago... the whale hunters picked him up. They brought him here, then left. - That's right. - Just a minute. But before that? Before? I can't remember. Now I understand. The war. Sailors, torpedo, the ship sinks, and you fell into a coma. That must be it. What's your name? No answer? Don't you have a name? That's funny! A guy with no name. Hey, listen, names are a dime a dozen. Let's find you one. They call me Boris the fisherman. Hold on, buddy. Boris! Boris the fisherman. No way. A Frenchman named - No way. Forget it. Wait. What? Nothing. It's nothing to do with you. Listen, buddy, with that nightingale in your throat, we'll earn lots of dough. You talk too fast. I don't understand you. Doesn't matter! Don't worry about that. - Do you trust me or not? - What will we do? We'll sing. We'll sing - Not here, I swear! - Where? Our place in the sun, Paris! - You have money, right? - No. What? No money? You've been in this hole ten years and you haven't saved a cent? Buddy, you haven't planned for the future. Neither have I. No matter. It might bring us luck. This is what we'll do: I'll be your manager. Have no fear, I know the ropes. - Are you in? - I'm in! Good man. You're no dummy. To leave Russia, you need a passport. They're hard to obtain. You have a passport, right? No. No ID. How will we manage? Well... Listen, how is it done here? Have a seat. I might be able to help. Let's see. A duke? Not in these times. A woman, wardrobe included. That's not our style. Of course. A Russian Jew. It will open doors. You'll have contacts in every city. - How about a French passport? - Certainly! - But it's expensive. - How much? Less than that! Much less. I see. I'll meet you halfway. Which means? Twenty-five fountain pens and 12 dozen pairs of suspenders. Twelve dozen pairs of suspenders? Fifty percent silk, 50 percent cotton? No way! Okay, half a dozen. I'm generous. It's a deal. Show me the passport. Here it is. Hold on. - It's genuine. - It looks fine. Let me through. You'll end up ruining my jacket. No, sir. Don't manhandle me. That's right, I came from over there. Thank you. There's no need to shove, gentlemen. This isn't a soup kitchen. This is worse than Madison Square Garden. Gentlemen, thank you for your friendly welcome. If I may... Be patient. My Russian isn't very good. I have a tenor. You understand? A tenor. Just magnificent, sir. I've just arrived from Nikolsky. Quite chilly. Don't bother. I'm French. - No kidding! - Yes. - My lucky day! Hello, sir. - Nice to meet you. - Please come in. - Thanks. Jules Billot, director of Radio Riga. Nice to meet you. Ernest Bisé, the king of ped - I mean, the king of agents. I've just discovered a real gem. - Who? - You'll soon find out. - What? - I've discovered the new Caruso. I see. I've heard that before. Sorry, I'm quite busy. Just listen, it's the deal of the century: the new Caruso for 100 francs a show. That's peanuts! By that I mean really cheap. As a fellow Frenchmen, please accept this. Sir, that's not our style. We're artistes. I said no. No use insisting. Hold on. I'll get him. - He's with me. - Is he under contract? Under contract? Our contract is watertight. Fine, I accept. 100 francs a performance. Hold on. I said 100 in local currency. Speak up, I can't hear you. Naturally, with a voice like that! I said 100 in local currency. You can't underpay my protégé. How about 150? 150? For a voice like that? Let's compromise: 200. I'm generous. It's a deal. 200 francs. I don't want him to wear out his voice. - When do we start? - Tonight at 5:00 p.m. - When does the cash box open? - I understand. This is Radio Riga. For the first time, you'll hear the mysterious Unknown Singer who will interpret "When I Love You." Tonight your beloved smile is gone What is wrong? Your lovely face is hard I don't know why You say awful things to me Why are you angry? Good Lord, what did I do? Banish all your doubts You must have faith In me How many times must I say That I love only you? Why doubt your happiness When I love you? Why close your heart When I love you? Why hold a grudge When I love you? Only a kiss Will end our tiff You can tell me all without fear All I want is your happiness, my dear Tell me all your Troubles, worries, and fears I'm your lover but also your friend Don't avoid a spat For afterward we're even happier After the rain and the storm The sky is always bluer Why narrow your eyes When I love you? Why wrinkle your forehead When I love you? Why look so upset When I love you? Come into my arms Darling And you'll forget all Run along, dear. You are my joy You are my life My most adored My sweetest support I have only one hope He sings really well, Mom. Who is it? A great singer, dear. - What's his name? - You wouldn't know it. Be quiet, dear, and listen. Do you know him? I knew him very well. But not anymore? - No. - Why not? He's in heaven, darling. When I'm far from you The birds in the trees No longer sing as sweetly Hello, Daddy. Where'd you come from? Home already? Hi, sweetie. Go and play, dear. Why do you do that? You know I don't like it. I don't know. I was playing records for Monique and I came across this one. Careful! You'll break it. It's the only record left. I swear. You'll bring us bad luck. You're silly to be so superstitious. This is Radio Paris. For the first time, you'll hear the mysterious Unknown Singer. ...a jewelry box with a lifetime guarantee. Now the official time from the Eiffel Tower. At the sixth tone, it will be exactly 12:32. Send in Miss Pierette. Sir? Since you're always asking, I've got a great assignment for you. Thank you, sir. - Do you know the Unknown Singer? - Yes. - No. - Neither do I. But tomorrow morning, I want our 100,000 readers to know him. - No problem. - Bravo. Where is he? He's singing at Radio Paris. You'll ask him where he's from, where he studied, and if he's married, widowed, or divorced. He's divorced? - "If he's divorced." - Oh, "if." And since when has he been unknown. - He was known before? - How should I know? - Take your camera. Get a photo. - Okay. - What if... - What? ...he doesn't want me to photograph him? - Do it anyway! - All right. Three hearts. I'll count. Listen, I'm tuning in to Radio Moscow. Sorry, that's not Moscow. Yes, it is Moscow. Hello. You're listening to Radio Paris. Ladies and gentlemen, the Unknown Singer will sing again after intermission. That was great. Gentlemen, take a break. Don't return until after intermission. Hold on! No one must see the Unknown Singer. Absolutely no exceptions. Thank you, gentlemen. You're wonderful tonight, my friend, in fine form. - Heading home? - No, I need to run an errand. Albert, drop me off here, please. Good-bye, dear. Will you be long? No. I'll be back soon. Home, Albert. UNKNOWN SINGER ONE NIGHT ONLY - UNKNOWN SINGER RADIO PARIS STAGE DOOR Excuse me. Can I help you? Can I see the Unknown Singer? That's impossible. He doesn't see anyone. No exceptions. Maybe you can help me. What's he like? Is he French? How old does he look? - I'd be so very grateful - - Sorry, we don't know. No one here has seen him. Thank you. ...in Paris's finest shops. And now you'll hear "When I'm Far from You," a waltz sung by the Unknown Singer. You are my joy You are my life My most adored My sweetest support I have only one hope Only one desire That our great love Goes on forever When I'm far from you My heart is askew Everything seems - ...far from you My heart is askew Everything seems sad and blue The birds in the trees No longer sing so sweet I get angry - No longer sing so sweet I get angry over nothing Everything is so annoying - Did you succeed? - Splendidly! - Who is it? - A charming man. - French? - Yes. - How old is he? - Between 30 and 40. Very slim, very elegant. Well-dressed. A flower in his lapel. When he learned I was from the newspaper, all he said was, "I can refuse you nothing." - I took a photo of him. - You did? Bravo! - I'll get it developed right away. - Wait! Come here. What's his name? I forgot to ask. What? You forgot to ask his name? Your assignment was to discover his identity. - Whose? - The singer's. I didn't see him. You just told me you took a photo of him! Not him, his manager. - Are you mocking me? - No, sir. What a pack of lies! Get out of here! Wait. Come here. I'll teach you the tricks of the trade. Listen carefully. - I have an idea. - You'd better. - What? - Nothing. When I hear him... his voice sounds familiar. - Get everything you needed? - Yes. - Your dress is quite lovely. - Didn't you see it before? I wasn't paying attention. - Shall we go out tonight? - Where do you want to go? The theater? All that's playing are tragedies. Did you see this? I was right. It's all about advertising. The "mystery" is just a gimmick. Why don't we go? If you don't want to, I can go by myself. I'll call for tickets. Hello? Get me Élysée 77-42. Hello? Hello! Is this the box office at the Élysée Theater? Any tickets for tonight? - You have one box left. - Take it. I'll go with you. Agreed. I'll send someone to pick them up. In the name of Mr. Corbigny. Yes, Corbigny. That's right. Thank you, miss. Jacques. Yes? Why did you do it? That record never hurt you. It wasn't me. I'm sure it'll bring us bad luck. Why would it? Are you crazy? Why did you do it? I dropped it. Tell the truth. You broke it. - So what? - I don't understand. What don't you understand? - Nothing. - Go on, tell me. Don't touch that. Tell me. Did you hear me? I said don't touch that. Jacques, I'm begging you. Calm down. I'm very calm. It's like you're afraid it's his voice. I'm afraid...? Of whom? Your Unknown Singer? Very funny. He can sing as much as he likes. It won't bring Ferval back. The dead don't return to give concerts. He's dead, you hear me? Dead as a doornail. My sweetheart. My little darling. He scared you, didn't he? Yes. Poor thing. No, don't cry. Don't cry. - Where are you - - Miss! - Hello, sir. - You again? I said to come back tomorrow. What a leech! Go away. Hands off! We're not on the subway. What do you want? To show you the photo I took of your singer. "Your singer." You think you're smart? - What? You photographed my singer? - Yes, sir. Incredible! Let me see. - Here. Don't touch! It's mine. - Let me see. How wonderful! Wonderful! - Where did you take that? - Bingo! Now I know his name. - What did you say? - I know his name! Give me that. Give it to me, girlie. Come on, be nice. Here. Don't get so upset. "May 1920"? - May 1920! - Give back my newspaper! - Hold on, hold on! - My newspaper. There, that's better. "Great Tenor Claude Ferval Lost at Sea." - Claude Ferval? - Didn't you know? - No. - He's keeping secrets from you. - What? - He's keeping secrets. Of course not. He didn't know himself. - He lost his memory. - No kidding? - Wait, that's not all. - What? - I have more. - Why didn't you say so? - You make my head spin. - This is fantastic. "Mysterious Death of Claude Ferval." "Interview with Mrs. Claude Ferval." What a great story for my first scoop! "27, rue de Monceau." 27, rue de Monceau... "The singer Zarelli will replace Claude Ferval in the current production of Dido." My goodness. 27, rue de Monceau. Okay. What are we going to do? I'm going to tell my boss I've identified the Unknown Singer. No way! Out of the question. - You're staying here with me. - Impossible, buddy. I won't lose my first big story because of you. - Listen. - No. Something amazing is about to happen and you'll have the exclusivity. - And only me? - Only you. - What do I have to do? - Come with me. You'll accompany the Unknown Singer to the Élysée Theater. Stick to him like glue. But first you must swear not to say a word about this. - It's of the utmost importance. - Okay, buddy. - You swear, not a word? - Yes. Let's go. 27, rue de Monceau. Hold on, hold on! Where are you, buddy? There you are. Hiding in the corner? I'd like to introduce Miss... - Pierette. - Miss Pierette. She's the secretary of the director of the Élysée Theater. I'm so pleased to meet you. How exciting! I wanted to meet you and get to know you, the great singer, Claude Fer - Charming girl, isn't she? Miss Pierette will bring you to the theater. You'll meet your accompanist, check the acoustics, see if everything's okay. - I'll join you a bit later. See you then. - Where are you going? Hold on. A small errand to run. - Shall we go? - Certainly, miss. Taxi! 27, rue de Monceau. We can't see a thing! Turn on the lights! We can't work. Here you go! Beautiful theater, isn't it? Quite beautiful. Tonight, it'll be packed. I hope so. It's the best concert hall in Paris. Have you seen it before? Yes, I think I have. I was sure of it. All the greats have sung here. It's strange. Those boxes... The upper circles... Perhaps you'll rediscover the sound of - - What? - Nothing. I'm babbling. Sometimes we feel like we already know places we've never been before. That's not how it feels. The acoustics are amazing. It's like hearing... an echo from the past. Perhaps as you sing tonight, many things will come back to you. - Many things? - I mean... - What? - Nothing... - Ready? - Yes. Where shall we start? The Neapolitan song. - Did I keep you waiting? - No. - Are you all right? - Of course. - Do you feel well? - Very well. - Did you try out the acoustics? - I did. What's wrong? You're acting strange. No, I'm - - What will you sing? - The Neapolitan song. Our old - - I'll leave you to it. - Yes. - Everything okay? - Fine. Did you find the address? Yes. And his wife? - What? - His wife? She's remarried. Listen, buddy, I have an idea. Tonight, after your concert, you'll unmask yourself onstage. - Take off my mask? - Yes. Look. "The Unknown Singer will be unmasked after the show." I don't understand. I won't be the Unknown Singer anymore. What name will you give me? What if you were called... Claude Ferval. Why Claude Ferval? Ever hear of a famous tenor named... Claude Ferval? Ferval... Sit down, buddy. Leave us. Listen, buddy... I'm going to tell you the story of the tenor Claude Ferval. He sang here for his farewell performance. It was Pénélope. Pénélope. The strange thing is he looked exactly like you. See for yourself. The whole story is there. That night, the concert hall was standing room only. All of Paris had come to hear the famous singer. Even the orchestra, overcome by enthusiasm, burst into applause. No one had ever seen such a success. What a triumph! That night, Claude Ferval was the king of Paris. Then he set sail for New York. He set sail for New York. For New York. This was about ten years ago. On exactly May 20, 1920... he set sail on the ocean liner France. A huge ocean liner. One night he sang a benefit concert for sailors' orphans. He exited the lounge and went out on the deck. A lovely evening. He could still hear the applause and enthusiastic cheers when suddenly he found himself alone, all alone, in the fog. The fog. The fog. He took a few steps towards the ship's rail and gazed at the sea. No one knows what happened next. Did he black out? Did he faint? In any case, he fell overboard. No, no! He tried to kill me. He tried... My boy! My poor boy. Quickly! Come help with this! Hurry! Programs! Get your programs here. Hey, you, up there. Move the second batten. That's it. A bit lower. Lower. Perfect. Leave it there. Hello, my friend. Pleased with the stage? In fact, I'd like some light in that corner. It'll be more punchy. Nothing could be easier. It'll be as punchy as you like. Get me the electrician. What's your Unknown Singer called? - In private? - Well, yes. "My darling." They're adorable. Sure. - Who? - The kids, up there. Let me see. Oh, yes! They know how to have fun. Come back during intermission. Give me a pair of opera glasses. Thanks. How about that! What? Hey, buddy. He's here, but without her. - What is it? - A lady to see the Unknown Singer. He's not seeing anyone. She insists she needs to see him. She gave me her card. Thanks. Hélène. No. You shouldn't see her. She'll see you with everyone else, when you take off your mask. I'll talk to her. - Where is she? - Over there. Mrs. Corbigny? I'm terribly sorry, but he can't see you before the performance. - He gave you my card? - Yes. And... he didn't say anything? No. Sorry. - I thought - - You knew him? That's right. No one knows the Unknown Singer. - I'm sorry to have bothered you. - Don't mention it. The exit to the hall is over there. Thank you. I was looking for you. You're needed on the stage. Let's go, stage manager. Ernest? Is that you? Claude. Sit down. You make a lovely widow. Let me explain! How dare you come here? I recognized your voice. That's impossible. - You surely forgot it. - No. You get rid of a husband and marry your accomplice. You start a new life, you're happy and in love, but... bad luck. The husband comes back after being murdered. - Murdered? - That's right, murdered. - Attacked from behind - - By Jacques! Don't act surprised. I'm not acting! I'm trying to understand, to remember. So before, my suspicions... Him. He did it. Go on, defend him! No. I don't defend him. You married a murderer, your accomplice. - Claude. - Let go! - Get out! - You can't go onstage without knowing. Ernest! Tell me what you'll do. I'll unmask myself for the audience and point at my two murderers. - Get onstage, buddy! - Show this woman out. There's no time to lose. This way, madam. Hurry! The bell's ringing. - Take your mask and get onstage. - I'm going. You can't be late. The audience is waiting. - Where were you? - Leave me alone. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Tonight your beloved smile is gone What is wrong? Your lovely face is hard I don't know why You say awful things to me Why are you angry? Good Lord, what did I do? Banish all your doubts You must have faith In me How many times must I say That I love Only you? Why doubt your happiness When I love you? Why close your heart When I love you? Why hold a grudge When I love you? Only a kiss Will end our tiff You can tell me all without fear All I want is your happiness, my dear Tell me all your Troubles, worries, and fears I'm your lover But also your friend Don't fear a little spat Afterwards we're even happier After the rain and the storm The sky is always bluer Why narrow your eyes When I love you? Why wrinkle your forehead When I love you? Why look so upset When I love you? Come into my arms Darling You'll forget all It's not him. I'm sure now. He hasn't changed. I'm moving out. Mommy and Daddy left, so I'm leaving too. Perfumes are less fine Colors lose their shine Life seems pale and wan When you are gone But when you reappear You chase away the gloom Nature bursts into bloom And all is well again When I'm far from you My heart is askew Everything seems sad and blue When I'm far from you The birds in the trees No longer sing so sweet I get angry over nothing Everything is so annoying When I'm far from you Life feels pale and blue Even roses seem less rosy Far from you Come on, buddy, it's the final number. Buck up! It'll be fine. I can't take any more. It's like singing into a void... like I'm blind. - You're not quitting, are you? - No. Drink this. You were splendid. Very moving. Remember, after this song, take off your mask and take a bow. Don't worry, I'm right here. Go on. You? You hurt me so badly Caused me so much pain Rather than suffer I wanted to forget you Rip you from my heart Banish you from my life Flee far from you Yet everywhere In spite of myself I see your eyes I hear your voice Cutting through the fog The memory of you haunts me I flee from your face Yet your image chases me As cruel as you are You fill my heart It's you I always return to You that I love I see your eyes I hear your voice Cutting through the fog The memory of you haunts me Like a nightmare Like a nightmare Taxi, sir? I see your eyes I hear your voice Cutting through the fog The memory of you haunts me I see your eyes I hear your voice I see your eyes I hear your voice Cutting through the fog The memory of you haunts me I flee from your face Yet your image chases me Off with the mask! Take off the mask! The mask! Take off the mask! Take off your mask. Take it off. The mask! - Your mask! - No, no... - I can't do it. - But we promised the audience! Raise the curtain. Well, buddy, that was a dirty trick. Why the devil didn't you want to unmask yourself? You wouldn't understand. If you'd heard the cheers when I took off the mask - Please leave. I need to be alone. Understand? What's going on? Nothing. A matter of the heart. I know about that. I've had my share. Let's go. STAGE DOOR Claude. I'm frightened. You... THE END
