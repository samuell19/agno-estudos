(CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING) Got a feeling That Christmas day is near And the spirit Of Santa Claus is here Such a wonderful time When the snow is in town It's a hell of a thrill When the sleigh bells sound What a wonderful time Betcha more than a dime The city bell's gonna chime Christmas star's gonna shine And old folks singing in rhyme Merry Christmas (VIDEO CONTINUES PLAYING) TODD: (OVER VOICE NOTE) Hey, love, just a quick message to say hi. I'm sure you're getting excited for Christmas, yeah? You better talk to your mom, yeah? Yeah, she knows the plans. Coming! Look, I gotta go, Gloria. I'll see you when this bloody tour's over, darling. Bye. Hey, Dad, just saying hi. Again. Can't wait to see you. Bye. CLAIRE: Gloria! You okay, honey? You're really quiet tonight. Gloria? I'm sorry. I've been sending Dad voice messages. He hasn't gotten back to me. His last one was, like, two weeks ago. Well, you know what he's like when he's on tour, honey, come on. Eat. Yeah, but he's always on tour. At least this one's over by Christmas. What, Mom? Well, your dad, he might stay in Germany for a while after his tour is over. GLORIA: But he said he'd come back to London... (OVEN BEEPING) ...and that we would have a proper Christmas. CLAIRE: I said he might, Gloria, okay? Your dad, he... Ow! He might stay in Germany for a while. Why? (SIGHS) He didn't say. Of course he didn't say. Do you guys even talk anymore? Of course we talk. We talk all the time. There is nothing to worry about. We're working it out. We are. Mm. Hey, you barely ate anything. Come on. I'm not hungry, Mom. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (SIGHS SOFTLY) (WIND WHISTLING) (ENGINE STARTS) The problem is down there. Not up here. WOMAN: But this is the wire. (GROANS) I've checked every single light. WOMAN: No, no, no. I have! WOMAN: Now you stay up there and you recheck those lights. MAN: Recheck the lights? WOMAN: Yeah. MAN: No way. (HORN BLARES) You watch where you're going, idiot! (GROANS SOFTLY) MAN: Why am I always the one up here anyway? WOMAN: Come on! Where's your Christmas spirit? MAN: My Christmas spirit is at home where I'm not being yelled at. (CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING OVER STEREO) MAN: Wally? What's he doing here? (WOMAN GROANS) And this. (SNORTS) (STU COUGHS) IFFY: Now, now, Stu, don't go dying on us. You know better than to tell me jokes while I'm sipping coffee. (MEN CHUCKLE) This wiring is almost as old as you, Stu. Me? (MEN LAUGH) IFFY: Whoa! Look who's here! STU: Turn the Christmas music off. Long time, no see, Bud. STU: Hey, Bud. (MUSIC STOPS) WALLY: What? What you looking at, old man? I got as much right to be here as anybody else. Sally, show him the sign. (SNORTS) That's for you, specifically. I'm sorry, Mr. McShane. He just started... Sally, it's fine. Just ring it up. I will pay. All right. Hey, that is assault! You all saw that! That is statutory assault! Get outta here, Finn Wally. You'll regret this, McShane! You'll regret this! IFFY: Way to go, Bud. The store's closing December 25th? For good? You know about this, Sally? No. How about you, Tevin? No. Explain yourself, old man. Store's been losing money for years. It's time to close it down. You can't do this. Betty and Bud's is an institution in this town, the heart of the community. In case you haven't noticed, Betty hasn't been around for a couple of years. IFFY: Yeah, I know that, Bud. But there must be something we can do... There isn't. Looks like you're gonna have to get your free coffee someplace else, Iffy. Sally, Tevin, I'll be in between now and Christmas. Help you close the thing down. MAN: They're still not working. I keep telling you. WOMAN: What are you saying? MAN: What I'm saying is there are too many lights. That's the problem. Same problem last year. Bunch of clowns. MAN: We need to take half of these down. (BUD GROANS SOFTLY) Well, Bet... (VOICE BREAKS) It's done. (HUFFING) BUD: Where did he come from? Damn heater. Who put up the reindeer display? Huh? Where'd you go? (EXCLAIMS) (GROANING SOFTLY) CLAIRE: I am sorry I am late, honey. It has been a crazy day. What happened this time? So I finished my project for work, which is great. That means we'll have some money this Christmas. So we're no longer on a limited budget. Oh, no, we're still on it. But at least now we have a little bit of wiggle room. But then I got a call from back home. Your granddad had an accident. He's in the hospital, but he's gonna be okay. Okay, well, that's good. You know what's even better? We're going to the U.S. of A. for Christmas. (LAUGHS) (SIGHS) Oh. I can't believe you, Gloria. We're spending the holidays with your American family, and you're acting like I grounded you for Christmas break. I'm sorry, but I'm not chuffed about spending time with people I don't even remember. (SIGHS) Apart from Granddad. I remember him. He was scary. I don't think he likes me. Of course he likes you. He can just be kind of grumpy sometimes. Well, what if Dad turns up whilst we're in America? He won't. He's not coming back to London for Christmas. You said might. CLAIRE: Well, he's not, okay. It's definite. He's spending more time in Germany. But why didn't he tell me? Because he doesn't like to be the bearer of bad news. That always falls on me. (SIGHS) You could finish these and send them to him though. I don't even know why I made those stupid drawings. It's not like I believe in Santa anymore. (SIGHS) Oh, honey, come here, come here. (KISSES) (CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING) It looks a lot Like Christmas to me (SONG CONTINUES PLAYING ON RADIO) What? I'm making a video of our trip. I wanna send it to Dad. Oh, that is a great idea, honey. Make sure you're getting your granddad's shop. I used to spend so much time there. And that is where my first boyfriend, Danny Baker, asked me out. You can get back to me on that. (CHUCKLES) It looks a lot like Christmas From here Maybe just because I have you near And, oh, there's not A spot of snow Not a drop of holly Or mistletoe There's a kind of magic I can clearly see And it looks a lot Like Christmas to me Claire. Oh, it's been so long. You look terrific. Hey, Erica. So do you. And who's this? I don't recognize you, Gloria. You've grown so much. (CHUCKLES) Your cousins were so excited when they heard you were coming. They should be home any minute. Where do I put this? Upstairs, honey. (SIGHS) She is so... cute. Mm. BUD: Bet? CLAIRE: So, how's Dad? A holy terror. He's been sleeping a lot since he got back from the hospital. I have been trying to get him to eat something, but he just yells at me. That sounds like Dad. You would not believe the state of this house when we got here. It was... (EXHALES DEEPLY) We had to go nuclear. (DOOR OPENS) TYLER: Aunt Claire. Hi! Oh, my, you got so big, look at you. (CHUCKLES) Hey. Hello, Claire. Hi, Gerry. Nice move. Oh, don't you start. Just 'cause Dad mumbled something about a reindeer causing his accident, I'm not going to apologize for putting up that display. CLAIRE: Gloria, come and say hi. Hey, Gloria. Hi. How's jolly old England, Gloria? (SNICKERS) Come on, jump in. Be quick. It's cold. CLAIRE: I know. (MOANS SOFTLY) There you go. Oh, yeah, Granddad called me Bet when I went into his room earlier. What were you doing in Granddad's room? Well, I didn't know which room was which. But why would Granddad call me Grandma? I just don't think he's feeling himself right now, honey. Is that why there's no Christmas decorations? No. That's because my mom always did the decorations, and since she's been gone, I don't think he's been feeling very Christmassy. That's sad. CLAIRE: Yeah. Wait, though. I think I have... I remember. GLORIA: Okay. Why is it so cold in here? Because Dad likes it cold, especially at nighttimes. We used to call this place the igloo growing up. GLORIA: I see why you call it the igloo. I feel like an ice block. Here you go. Hmm. I love you, honey. I love you more. Not possible. Good night It is possible. (KISSING) Good night. Good night. (EXCLAIMS SOFTLY) GERALD: We need to talk, about Dad... CLAIRE: Do this in the morning, Gerry? GERALD: Look, he's not well. CLAIRE: There's nothing wrong with him. GERALD: How would you know? You're never here. CLAIRE: Oh. Okay. This again. GERALD: Do you know how difficult it is... CLAIRE: This is his home, Gerald. He needs to stay in his home. GERALD: All right. Well, so are you going to be here? It's true and you know it, Claire. You've been home, what? Twice in ten years? You moved to England. You wiped your hands of this family. Gerald, come on. That's enough. Claire just got here. All I said was, I think it's time that Dad moved to the retirement village and she jumps all over me. Like she's worried about Dad all of a sudden. Of course I'm worried about Dad. That is really offensive. We've been here, Claire. Come in from California every year. We've seen how Dad's slipped. He lives in squalor. He forgets to take his medication. So your first thought was to send him off to a retirement village? He would hate that. GERALD: Did Erica tell you about all the unpaid bills we found when we got here? They were going to turn off the gas, the electricity. Imagine if we hadn't been here to sort that out. Dad would have frozen to death. I'm telling you, he's not all there. Look, let's just see how the week goes with Dad. Before we leave if we think it's necessary, we can discuss getting some kind of help for him. See? I like Erica's plan way better. Fine. But if one more thing happens with Dad, just one, he's off to the retirement home. End of discussion. CLAIRE: That's the spirit, Gerry. (CLINKING SOFTLY) (CREAKING) (THUDDING) Mom? (THUDDING CONTINUES) Who are you? Oh, I'm Gloria. Did you hear something on the roof? What are you doing here? Reindeer don't live around here. I ran off the road because of you. I got a concussion, you know. Feels like there's a jackhammer inside my head. (GRUNTS SOFTLY) BUD: Do you understand what I'm saying? Because I'm talking to you. And I assume that you do because you do these other things. What are you doing? What are you doing? What's that deer doing? (GRUNTING SOFTLY) She's talking back to me. (CHUCKLES) Was that a reindeer? Was that a reindeer? Do you own it? Wait, what was its name? What you mean by, "it was talking to you"? Like, what you mean by "ran you off the road"? Who are you again? Gloria, your granddaughter. Ah. Right. It's the accent's throwing me off. You were a lot smaller when I saw you last. (CHUCKLES) Duh. Because I was like four. Don't go telling anyone about that deer. You understand? Why? Okay, okay. Jeez. I won't tell anyone about the deer. I promise. Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one horse open sleigh Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one horse open sleigh Ah. Dad, you're up. That's fairly obvious, isn't it? Come on, Tyler. That's too much. Yeah, I'll take one. You want something to eat? I'm sitting at the dining room table, Gerald, a table covered with plates of food. Yes, I would like something to eat. Okay. Have you said hi to your daughter, Claire, who came all the way from London to see you? Hi, Dad. BUD: Hello, Claire. CLAIRE: You remember Gloria? Yeah, we bumped into each other last night. CLAIRE: You did? When? Oh. We heard a bang on the roof. It was nothing. Don't worry. Um, nobody else heard it? Maybe it was Krampus. Here we go. Haley's favorite Christmas movie. Well, because if it was him, some of us aren't getting out of here alive. I think that's enough about Krampus, Haley. GERALD: Erica, I think the eggs are burning. Hey, where's all my stuff at? You mean the mess in the living room and the kitchen? I had a system. But, Dad, I think the most important thing is, how are you feeling? Fine. (CELL PHONE RINGS) Um, no, I'm sorry. I got to take this. So, Dad, we're heading into town for some last-minute Christmas shopping. Claire said she'd look after you. That's not necessary. I'm not an invalid. Actually, Dad, you kind of are. You just got out of the hospital. So, Gloria can stay. Gloria's ten. You need an adult with you. I'm just going to sit here and watch TV. What's to do? Well, if that's all he does, then I'm fine with staying. There you go. Mm. (COFFEE SPILLS) (GROANS) That's okay, Dad. I'll take care of it. No, I'll do it. I can do it. Erica, Please. Leave it be! Dad. Uh, keys. Car keys. Where's the keys? ERICA: On the counter. GERALD: Thanks. Hey. Hi. You sure you're okay with staying here with Granddad? Yeah. I mean, you remember what I said. He's not... (SIGHS) He's not quite himself right now. You understand that, right? Yeah, I know. It'll be all right. I promise. Okay, but you call me if you need anything. Yes. Yes? Yes. Yes? Yes. Okay. I love you. I love you too. Bye. GERALD: Whose is this? That's mine. Give it to me. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Um, where do you think you're going? None of your beeswax. You stay here in the nice, warm house. This is your idea of warm? Smart-ass. I got a smart-ass for a granddaughter. You stay. What am I to you? A dog? Woof, woof, bark, bark. Are we actually leaving? Hold on! I thought I told you to stay at the house. GLORIA: Well, I didn't want to stay at the house. BUD: (CHUCKLES) You're like a gnat. Just keep buzzing around. GLORIA: What's wrong with you? Why are you acting like this? I don't like people who hover. I thought you'd be less of a nuisance than your mother. But now I'm starting to rethink that one. Well, I'm rethinking agreeing to stay with you. I'd rather have been alone this Christmas. Well, I'd rather be back in England. (CHUCKLES) Well, good. Now that we've straightened that out. Reindeer tracks. GLORIA: Why are you so excited about the reindeer anyways? Because he's an anomaly. What's that mean? BUD: That means reindeer don't live anywhere around these parts. Don't live anywhere in the entire United States for that matter. So then why... Why is this one here? Yeah. That's what I mean to find out. Look at that. He circled right back around to my place. (SCOFFS) I'll be danged. Hey, where are you going? BUD: There he is. What's he looking for? Are you getting this? GLORIA: (WHISPERS) Yeah. Where's he going now? He's heading towards my workshop. (REINDEER GRUNTS) Wait. Granddad, I don't think we should go in here. How old are you anyway? Seven, eight? I'm ten! Yeah, well, I've got over seven decades on you, which means that I get to tell you what to do, not vice versa. (HUFFING) Granddad, don't. You don't know where that deer's been. (CONTINUES HUFFING) (REINDEER GRUNTS) BUD: That guy's looking for food. Grab that bucket and go get some chestnuts. Are you sure you're gonna be okay in here with him? Questions, questions, always questions. Now get, before I lose my temper. Hey, look what I... Granddad, guess what? I found this in the snow where that guy was snooping around. BUD: Did you want me to see that? (HUFFS) Okay. All right. Here we go. Now stay away from me, please? BUD: It's not here. Gerald must have thrown away the rest of the broken parts. Come on, let's go. Where? You'll see. But, look, what about him? BUD: Don't worry about him. He'll be fine. GLORIA: I can't believe you brought me here, Granddad. Let's just go, okay? It really stinks out here. Of course it stinks. It's a dump. Are you gonna help? It'll go a lot faster if you do. Come on, get your hands dirty. First of all, ew. And second of all, why can't you just make a new reindeer? Yes! Found the ass-end. (CHUCKLES) Look what else I found. What is it? It's a sign from the store right next to me. Stacey's Antiques. She went under about six months ago. Wait. Hold on. She died? No, no, her store did. (CHUCKLES) Guess my sign will be out here, too, pretty soon. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. (EXCLAIMS) Attagirl, Gloria. We'll be out of here in no time. Good, because it's really grotty down here. "Grotty"? What is that? Some kind of English swear word? (GIGGLES) Oh, yeah, Granddad. One of the worst. Oh. Oh. (REINDEER GRUNTS) Hey, get outta here! (REINDEER GRUNTING) GLORIA: Jeez! Well, you scared Prancer off. Oh. So he's Prancer now, is he? Do you think he's coming back? I don't know. Hey, um... Uh... Gloria. Yeah, you're doing a really great job there, you know that? Yeah. You're a good artist, Gloria. Just like your grandma. She didn't paint this, did she? Sure did. I made them. She painted them. So now I see why you dragged me to the dump. Yep, had to be this deer. Come on, let's finish this up, get him back up there with the rest of them. What is going on out there? Hey, Dad! GERALD: What the... Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. (SNICKERS) GERALD: Dad? BUD: Thank you. GERALD: Dad, what are you doing? Get down, Dad. Come on. Let me do that. I put them up in the first place. Get down from there, Dad. Let me do that. I'm already up here. (PANTING) What's with you? Why are you even trying to fix that blooming thing? Bet would've wanted me to fix this guy. She surely did love these reindeer. You knew that, Gerald. But you still threw it away. HALEY: This morning Granddad was all grumpy ass. Now look at him. He's acting like a kid. It's not a bad version of him. (BOTH SNICKER) What... It's on. Whoa! Okay? No, no, no. GERALD: Careful. Okay. It's okay. Oh, my God! BUD: I got it. There. Okay, hold the ladder. GERALD: I got you. BUD: Thanks. GERALD: Careful. BUD: Yep. I cannot believe you let your granddad drive to the garbage dump. I mean, what were you thinking? Ow! Mom, that really hurts! Yeah, well, I'm trying to get the paint out, okay? And you smell really bad, Gloria. Then maybe I could just sleep on the sofa like you make Dad do sometimes. Uh, Mom, you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, honey. I'm just... I'm really tired. Jet lagged, you know. Yeah, Mom? Mm-hmm. Are you and Dad talking about when he's gonna come back home? Yeah. Yeah, we're talking, honey. We are. TODD: (OVER VOICE NOTE) Hi, love. Just a quick message to say hi. I'm sure you're getting excited for Christmas, yeah? Uh, you better talk to your mom. Yeah? Um, yeah, she knows the plans. MAN: Hey, Todd, mate. Gotta go! TODD: Coming! I gotta go, Gloria. I'll see you when this bloody tour's over, darling. Bye. (MOANS SOFTLY) BUD: First time I saw that deer was in the cemetery when I was visiting Bet. And then he flew right over my truck. That was the cause of my accident. He must have just jumped. Nope. He never came back down. I looked through all my windows, checked out the rearview mirror, nada. Pass me the turpentine, will you? Gloria, what do you think we heard the other night on the roof? I don't know. Some sort of possum. Tree branch. There was nothing up there on the roof when I shone my light up there. So, what? You're saying a reindeer landed on your roof. (CHUCKLES) Come on, Granddad. I mean... You think I'm crazy? Yes! I think you've lost the plot. Oh. Oh. No, no, no, no. I mean, I mean, I just don't believe in Santa anymore. So that's why it doesn't make sense to me. Um, wait. Why are you telling me this? You asked, for one thing. More important, you and I are in this together. It was only the two of us who heard that noise on the roof. Yeah, so... About that. Um, I heard Uncle Gerald talking to my mom. Uh... He thinks you should go live in a retirement home. Right. If Gerald finds out about that deer, that's grist for his retirement home push. No. He won't find out about the deer. We're in this together, just like you said. This is our secret. Okay. Our secret. (PLAYING SCALES ON PIANO) GERALD: We're back finally. Forgotten how slippy those roads get. Justin time. We need those sprinkles. GERALD: Yeah, coming right up. Hey, Claire. Yeah? You will never guess who I just bumped into on Main Street. Finn Wally. Oh, God, what a creep. Is he still here? Yeah, well, regardless, he told me he just recently came into some money. An inheritance I think. And he was asking about the house up here. He was wondering, you know, since the hardware store's closing... Wait. Are you saying Finn Wally wants to buy this house? Stop it. Play something else, will you, Tyler? It's always scales, scales, scales. It drives me crazy. (SIGHS) Why don't you go up to your room, Haley? Or you can help out here in the kitchen. I'm gonna go to my room and call one of my friends. Mm-hmm. HALEY: Stop it, Tyler! TYLER: Okay, okay. Yeah. Well, anyway, uh, it's the land Finn's after. It's good hunting land. He said he'd make a really good offer. I can't believe you're even considering this. Dad hates that asshole. You should, too. (SIGHS) Who's this Finn Wally? He's a hunter. That's what he does for a living and he... Trespassed on Dad's land. I mean, this was years ago. Gerry was what, like ten? So he went out into the woods. Finn Wally wanted to shoot a deer. He missed and he almost hit Gerry. My God. You never told me this. Because there was nothing to tell. wasn't hurt. Yeah, but you could have been. I mean, Dad went ballistic on Wally, okay. He said, "If I ever find you here on my land again..." (SCOFFS) And now, Wally wants to buy the land? It would be wrong if I didn't pass on the information. We need to face facts here, people. Nothing Dad has done this week has changed my mind about his situation. We need to have a serious conversation about what we're gonna do about him. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) You all don't want me driving, so... Gloria and me are gonna need a ride to the store tomorrow morning. I got to take care of some things before the store closes. Well, I can help with that, Dad. No, no, no. It's okay. I got it covered. CLAIRE: And try to behave yourself, you two, okay? GLORIA: We will. I'm excited to see this. Granddad? This is bloody brilliant, Granddad. Is that supposed to be a compliment? Well, what does it sound like? Well, whenever I hear the word "bloody" it's usually not such a good thing. This here is Curmudgeon Corner. It was your grandma who came up with that idea, to have the place for the old timers to hang out. Is that what they call coffin dodgers? BUD: Never you mind. I wasn't so hot about the idea at first, giving up valuable floor space to a bunch of freeloaders. But your grandma, she put her foot down, and as usual, she was right. (CHUCKLES) Curmudgeon Corner turned out to be a big plus for this place. I don't remember much about Grandma. BUD: Well, now, that's a shame. Your grandma was just about the sweetest person you could ever want to meet. That's not to say she didn't have a temper. (CHUCKLES) She could be fierce if you crossed her, but always generous to a fault, and as kind as the day is long. Yup. It was two years ago, just before Christmas that she... So, not my favorite holiday. You miss her. Yeah. You have her eyes, you know that? Do I? We don't look alike. Without a doubt. I look at you and... (LOUD THUD) GLORIA: Uh... What was that? BUD: Let's go find out. GLORIA: Do you think someone tried to break in? BUD: If they did, they can have anything they want. GLORIA: Granddad. What? Huh! What are you doing here? I thought you'd be long gone by now. (DOOR OPENS) Hello. BUD: Uh... You stay here, I'll go deal with Sally. No, no, no, Granddad, don't. Just be nice to him. (PRANCER HUFFING) GLORIA: No, Granddad, don't! Please! Please! No! Granddad! Granddad! Hey. (GRUNTING SOFTLY) BUD: Hey, Sally. Oh. Mr. McShane, thank God. I thought maybe someone had tried to break in. (THUDDING) GLORIA: Whoa, whoa, whoa. (SHUSHING) That's my, uh, granddaughter. (SOFTLY) Hey, hey! Oh, my God! Calm down. She wanted to come in to work with me today, so... It's okay. (SHUSHING) Stop. Stop. Stop. No. Don't, don't. No! (PRANCER GRUNTING) She's, um, rearranging some stuff. Oh. BUD: On the shelves. (PRANCER CONTINUES GRUNTING) Ugh! Prancer! Okay, you're probably fine. I'll come help you. It's okay, okay. I'm going to help. All right? So... (GRUNTS) Hey, hey, hey, hey. Okay. All right. Hey, hey! No, no, no! (HUFFING SOFTLY) Uh, Sally, could you look under the counter for my keys? Your keys? You dropped your keys? I dropped my keys either there or... You lost them again? I can't see anything down here. I know. They're... Are you sure? How about a little further over? Maybe that's it. Um... No, I don't think they're here. I can't see them anywhere. Uh, I was going for something. SALLY: Well, no. Not down here. Nothing? Mr. McShane, I don't see any keys anywhere. Oh. Oh! Uh... I'm sorry, I had them all along. (CHUCKLES) GLORIA: Oh, you're back. Look at this mess. (SIGHS) No way! Granddad as Santa. (CHUCKLES) Oh. Wait, but hold on... So you're telling me you created all this mess, almost got caught, just to show me this? (DOOR OPENS) Whoa! Oh, hi, I'm Gloria. I'm Mr. McShane's granddaughter. Hey, Tevin. Why are you coming in the back way? Uh, I have to get a delivery together for, um, Mrs. Bradley. Right. I'll tell you what, I'll take care of it. Um, listen, it might be better if nobody knows about the deer. I'm planning a surprise for Christmas. Oh, yeah, yeah, okay. BUD: Could you go out there and get the fire started? Uh, yeah, sure. (PRANCER GRUNTING SOFTLY) Can I have the list? Oh, and your car keys? Oh, uh, nice meeting you, Gloria. Yeah. See ya, dude. (SPEAKS INCOHERENTLY) (GRUNTS SOFTLY) GLORIA: Where is he going? So what are we gonna do? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Tevin will keep Prancer a secret. The more important question is, how did that deer get inside of my locked store? There's got to be some logical explanation. Oh, yeah. One of them being Prancer is magical. Prancer is not magical, and I don't believe in him. Smart, yes. Magical, no. I think he's here for a reason. He could have left if he'd wanted to, but he didn't. So he decided to stay, gonna wreck your life, and then you end up in a retirement home. You watch, that deer's got something on his mind. Too bad he can't talk like Mister Ed. Then he could tell us what he was thinking. (CHUCKLES) Wait, who is Mister Ed? What? Am I meant to know Mister Ed? Of course you are. Don't you go to school? Yeah, but we don't learn about Mister Ed. Well, then there's something wrong with your school. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I had to get one more delivery before your store closed. I was so disappointed to hear about that. Yeah, well, we had a good run, but it's time. I have such fond memories of shopping at your store. Betty, she was always such a hoot. Yeah, she surely could make people laugh. Unlike yours truly. Oh, you're not so bad. You might think you are, but your bark was always worse than your bite. All done. I think you deserve a hot chocolate for that, Gloria. Oh, yes, please. BUD: No, we've got to get on back to the store. Oh. Coffee for you maybe, Thomas? BUD: Um, thanks. But no. Come on, Gloria, let's skedaddle. Bye-bye. Bye. She's nice. I think she thinks you're nice too. Oh, stop it, Gloria. What's that supposed to mean? Granddad, I saw the way she looked at you. She likes you. Get in the car, Gloria. Nancy and I have known each other a long time, going all the way back to high school. Nancy? Ooh! What is wrong with you? We're friends. We've always been nothing but friends. Whatever you say... Thomas. Hey, your son tell you about my offer? I want to buy your house, old man. Figured with the store closing you'd be off to some old age home. Oh, grot you! Come on, Gloria. "Grot" me? Come on. Some nice old age home. Um, Granddad, um... "Grot you"? Yeah, I didn't want to say the other thing in front of you. Oh, no, no, no. (WALLY YELLING INDISTINCTLY) I didn't mean "grot" as like a swear word. I meant it being, like, dirty or gross. Yeah. Well, that stupid idiot doesn't know that, does he? True. But I've still got so many questions. Who is that guy? MAN: Hey, Gloria. Mine will have two sugars, please. Just like Betty's back. (CHUCKLES) Save me one of those cookies. (MEN LAUGHING) No, no, no. You've had, like, 50 today. No, I know that one. (CUSTOMERS LAUGHING) Gloria, unlike hanging around this guy, it's been a pleasure. Yeah, I really enjoyed it. Yeah. See you, guys. See you later. GLORIA: Oh, and Tevin. Don't spoil our surprise. I'll think about it. No, no, no, no. You think about it. Hey, honey. How did it go? Really, really good. Yeah. I enjoyed it. Dad? Good, yeah. I'm tired. But good. (CREAKING) (WIND WHISTLING) (THUDDING) Prancer! What are you doing? Why are you here? Why are you in our kitchen? And why are you in our house? (PRANCER GRUNTS SOFTLY) (SHUSHING) What are you doing? If this is some sort of midnight snack, you should not have fruit. Stop that. Why are you so loud when you chew apples? Excuse me. Where do you think you're going? Please. What? What... What... What do you want from me? You want me to follow you? What? No way. This is bonkers, Prancer. Yeah. I'm not gonna follow you. I am not gonna follow you. Oh. (PRANCER GRUNTING SOFTLY) GLORIA: Prancer. Prancer, where are you? Goldang it. GLORIA: Prancer, this is not funny. This was a bad idea. You wanted me to follow you, and I'm freezing out here. Where are you? This isn't funny anymore. (OWL HOOTING) Okay, I'm not getting eaten. I'm out of here. (CHITTERING) GLORIA: Prancer! (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) Ugh. (YELLS) BUD: Gloria. GERALD: Oh, Dad. Why listen to Gerald? This wouldn't happen in a retirement home. What do I know, huh? What do I know? (ANIMALS HOWLING IN DISTANCE) (PRANCER GRUNTING IN DISTANCE) (CONTINUES GRUNTING) Where have you been? So now you've finally arrived. (GIGGLING) Stop it! Stop it! What are you even doing? Oh, Dad. (CHUCKLING) BUD: Gloria. What's going on? Why didn't you wake me? Oh, Prancer came to the house. He wanted to show me something. So you came out here in the woods all by yourself to see what it was? Well... (GLORIA AND BUD TALKING IN DISTANCE) GERALD: Get a load of this, Claire. GLORIA: No wonder the house is freezing. BUD: What are you trying to tell us, Prancer? (GRUNTING SOFTLY) Come on, Granddad. Oh! What's going on with you? I tripped, fell. I'm all right. Come on. No, no. Come on. Let's go back to the house. Get some ice on it. But Prancer? BUD: We won't be able to follow you tonight, Prancer. Sorry. Going to have to come back tomorrow. See you. (ANIMAL HOWLS IN DISTANCE) (GASPS) (PRANCER GRUNTS) (EXCLAIMS) No, not the phone. Oh. (PRANCER HUFFS) GERALD: She'll be down in a second. (BOTH SLURP) You sure you don't want some hot cocoa, son? Looks like you need warming up. What is going on? Sit, please. Just now, I found these two in the woods conversing with a reindeer. Reindeer? What are you talking about? The animal attacked me and did this to my phone. The animal did not attack you, Ger. CLAIRE: Dad? Do you want to explain what's going on? Gloria? Fine. Give us the silent treatment. But just so you know, first thing tomorrow I'm calling Finn Wally. No, you're not, son. Who is Finn Wally? He's the jerk we ran into outside of the store. GERALD: Deer are not aggressive like that, Dad. You know that, right? There's something wrong with it. I mean, you've heard the reports. Bubonic plague. That's what some of the animals in the woods are carrying. I heard it on the news this morning. That deer does not have bubonic plague. How do you know? Because it's not the 14th century, Gerry. Look, Gerald, if you call Finn Wally, the two of us are going to have a really big problem. I'm tired. I'm going to go to bed. This is all really strange. I mean, I can't even... (EXHALES DEEPLY) Let's just deal with it tomorrow, when we've all had some sleep. GERALD: Fine with me. You... You're grounded. Oh, great! I'm off to child prison again. (WIND WHISTLING) Oh, my gosh! Guys, wake up! It snowed last night! Tyler, wake up! GERALD: Psychotic deer... ...middle of the night... What is he up to? HALEY: Is he actually talking to himself? GERALD: Dad has gone crazy. (GRUNTS AND EXCLAIMS) (LAUGHING) HALEY: Oh, Mom, help him up. Need a hand, Dad? (SIGHS) (KNOCK AT DOOR) (CHUCKLES) What are you doing up here? How come you're not downstairs? Oh. Mom grounded me. What for? Did you crack? What? After I left, they gave you the third degree. So did you crack? Did you tell them everything? Oh, no, no, no. Of course not. Ah! Attagirl. Way to go. (CHUCKLES) Oh, did Gerald call that git, Finn Walrus? Oh, no, no, no, Finn Wally? BUD: Wally doesn't have a phone. Gerald's going to drive over to his place after he digs out his car. I wanted to have it out with him, but evidently we're not speaking at the moment. So what should we do? We can try and protect Prancer? I think that deer can probably take care of himself. What's more important is that the two of us get our ducks in a row. And I got my duck. Whoa, you've got a pet duck? BUD: No, no, no. I mean, I think I know why Prancer is here. He wants me to keep the store open. That's why he was there yesterday, to tell me that. And? Ah, I'm not sure, but I think maybe there's some kind of connection between Prancer and Bet. Why? BUD: I don't know exactly. Uh, not everything in life has a logical explanation, Gloria. Some things you just feel. Yeah, I understand. BUD: Hmm. But why did you close the store in the first place? Well, when me and Bet ran the store together, we were... We were like this. We were magic. After she passed, I just gradually lost interest in everything. I stopped paying the mortgage. The bank finally forced my hand. What can you do about that? Um, I don't know, really. Something will turn up. In the meantime, I'm going to go downstairs and have a word with your mother and see if I can't spring you. (CHUCKLES) Okay. ERICA: Oh, my God! (LAUGHING) GERALD: That's not funny. ERICA: Pretty funny. GERALD: Could've hurt myself. ERICA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (FAMILY CONTINUES LAUGHING) I know I used to ground you when you were a kid. But you did some really stupid stuff back then. Stupider than sneaking out in the middle of the night to talk to a reindeer? (SIGHS) CLAIRE: Kids, huh? They sure do change you, don't they, Dad? Mm-hmm. Gloria made me grow up. I had to. Hey. Hey, what's going on? I'm... I'm a mess right now, Dad. Uh-huh. And? And you don't want to hear about it. Come on, Claire. It's me. You're my daughter. Everything you warned me about Todd, it came true. Everything. There, I said it. You can say, "I told you so." Okay. I told you so. Yeah. You two guys splitting up? Oh, he moved out months ago. Gloria thinks we're still gonna get back together, but that is... That's not going to happen. I'm so worried about her dad. Because he was never a good father. But Gloria, she really, really loves him and... And she can't understand why he doesn't want to see her more when he comes to London and it's breaking her heart. I'm sure it is. Look, Claire. Um... This is not the most exciting town in the world... (CHUCKLES) ...and it certainly isn't London, but it's still your home. (SNIFFLES) And you're always welcome. Yeah. Yeah. Gloria can come down at noon. Sentence served? Sentence served. (ENGINE POWERS DOWN) WALLY: So is he going to sell? GERALD: I'm not here about that. I got a job for you. WALLY: What kind of a job? What do you think? Two hundred bucks a day. All right. Plus expenses. Expenses? Ammunition, food, butane gas if I have to camp out overnight. I stay out until I get the job done, McShane. All right. All right, you're hired. What am I hunting? GERALD: Reindeer. Reindeer? GERALD: That's what I said. I get to keep the antlers. Kids! GERALD: It's done. Finn says I'm doing the right thing. Animals are territorial. That reindeer will keep coming back if I hadn't hired him to take care of it. I think it's odd, Ger. You wanting to hire a man who almost shot you? Well, Finn's the best in the area. And he agrees the reindeer might be diseased. Look, if I've got to be the bad guy to protect everyone, so be it. Is that the only reason you're doing this, to protect everyone? What's that supposed to mean? You just seem so angry at your father. I'm not angry. I'm just concerned. I mean, come on, Erica. He's out in the middle of the night talking to a reindeer. You know, that's like... He needs care. He needs to be in a place where he's taken care of. (CROW CAWING) Oh. There you are. How come you're not out there sledding with everyone else? I told them they shouldn't go sledding. Not with that deer. (CHUCKLES) Painted yourself into a corner, did you? Oh, come on, Ger, don't be like that. Come on, have a seat. I want to talk to you about something. I... I could really use your help. GERALD: And what do you need my help with? I need you to go down to the store and have a look at the books. Bring them home if you have to. Why? Because you're the accountant. I need you to help me figure out a way to keep the store open. But Dad... No. Closing the store is absolutely the right thing to do. Why? So you can ship me off to Pine Grove, where everybody's all happy. I'm not going there, Ger. I really love this house. And it would kill me having to be put in a place like that and you know it. So please, help me with the store. Dad, you're not really feeling like yourself right now. You know that, right? All this stuff with the deer. (SIGHS) This is the first time you've ever asked my help with something, you know that? BUD: No. Really? That's not right. It is. Well, uh... I mean, you know, you left home at a very young age. You met Erica, made a life for yourself, and a very good life and I'm proud of you. I'm talking about when I was a kid. A kid? (CHUCKLES) Jeez. I just always assumed that you wanted to go off and do your own thing with your friends. Yeah, well... Amazing how often parents and kids don't know what the other one's thinking. I would have loved it if you'd have asked for my help around here or in the workshop. Look, Ger. I'm, uh... I'm really sorry, okay? I know I can be closed off sometimes. I just go into my own world, and I don't want to let anyone else in. But, right now, at this very moment, I am asking for your help. I need to keep the store open, Ger. As long as I possibly can. GERALD: Okay, Dad. I'll go get the books. But don't get your hopes up. Oh... HALEY: It was so much easier when I was sliding on my butt! (ALL LAUGHING) CLAIRE: Give me your hand. Come on! ERICA: Kids, you got to stay on your feet. Stay on your feet! HALEY: That was so cool. Get to the fire swiftly. I am freezing. Yeah, it's very cold. That was amazing. GLORIA: That was my first time. HALEY: Really? You're amazing for a first timer. Cool, retro games. Come on. Come on. (ALL CHEERING) So done. Go on, get outta here! Walk of shame, brother. Sorry. I'm out here! I'm done, too. You guys can divvy up my stake. Oh, no, Granddad, stay. You just want to take me to the cleaners. Yeah. Very funny. I'm gonna go up and see how Gerald is doing, and them I'm gonna hit the sack. GLORIA: Okay, so it's my turn to roll. Yeah. Hey, Dad? BUD: Hmm? Are you feeling okay? Yeah, sure. Of course I am. This is great, huh? All of us here together. Feels like... home. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) GLORIA: Okay, so whose turn? 'Cause they landed on my property. You stop trying to take my cash. BUD: Everybody okay with this? GLORIA: (HESITATES) Yeah. Yeah. Good. Night. CLAIRE: Good night. (PLAYING SCALES) Oh, no. He's not... I'm gonna go to bed. Okay, good night. Good night. (SNORING SOFTLY) (PRANCER GRUNTING IN DISTANCE) (ENGINE RUNNING) (PRANCER CONTINUES GRUNTING) Hmm? BUD: You know what time it is? (ENGINE RUNNING) God damn it. Granddad, what's going on? What's going on is that deer needs to stop showing up in the middle of the night. It's exhausting. Okay, then why are you out here? This snowmobile was running when I came out here. Prancer did this. (ENGINE POWERS DOWN) (CHUCKLES) Come on, Granddad! Last night, he wanted you to follow him. I told him to come back tomorrow, so he did. And he started the snowmobile. Go back in the house, then. I'll tell you what's happening. No, I'm not going back in the house. If you're going out to look for Prancer, I should be with you. You got hurt last night following Prancer. What do you think your mother would say to me if I told her I was taking you back out there again tonight? I don't care. Prancer wants me to follow him, not you. So you jump on the snowmobile and go find out what he wants, yourself. (ENGINE RUNNING) Hold on tight, you hear? Both hands. GLORIA: Granddad, I can't see him anywhere. Granddad, over there! (BELLOWS) You holding on tight? Yep! Okay. Let's do it. GLORIA: Faster, faster! Over there! (GASPS) (SIGHS) Erica! They're at it again! Whoo-hoo! Hold on. (PRANCER BELLOWS) (CHUCKLING) GERALD: I knew I heard something. ERICA: What's going on? GERALD: Dad and Gloria have gone out on the snowmobile. I'm going to go find them. In the middle of the night? I'll check Gloria's phone. I'll come too. No, you are not. Well, I can't believe Gloria gets to go on a midnight ride on the show mobile with Granddad. (DOOR CLOSES) Ugh! Bed. Good night! (GRUNTING) Hey, Prancer, watch out! (PRANCER BELLOWING) (HORN HONKING) (EXCLAIMS) Hey, you almost ran him over. Sorry I missed him. Damn you, McShane! (GRUNTING) Prancer, the car! (PRANCER BELLOWS) Uh, Granddad, why did he bring us here? I don't know. Hold on. Are you seeing what I'm seeing? I sure am. It's a party, Granddad. Get closer, Granddad, closer! (ENGINE REVS) Hold on! Gloria! (GROANS) Gloria! Gloria. Gloria. Oh, no. Oh, no. No. No. Please, God. No. Granddad, I filmed it. I filmed it. Where's my phone? No, no. Don't move. Don't move, please. Granddad, we've got to show it to Gerald. Don't move. Now they're gonna believe you. All right. I'll go look. Okay. No, no. Stay down. What'd I tell you? It's okay, Granddad. I'm just a little shook up. Well, listen to me. GLORIA: Mom. Gloria. You've really gone off the deep end this time, Dad, huh? Are you hurt? Are you sure? No, but we saw a reindeer. She was... She was leaning out of the... No, no. You are the last person I want to see right now, Dad. What were you thinking, Dad, huh? Putting her on the back. Why were you... The reindeer followed us. (SHUSHES) Are we still with this deer? Come on. I didn't believe him until just now. Believe him about what? That deer is magical. And why is nobody listening to me? It's on the phone. CLAIRE: You know what? I have heard enough about the reindeer, Gloria. In the car. But, Granddad, you know... (MUFFLED) GERALD: Get in the car, Dad. GLORIA: (CRYING) It's on the phone. GERALD: Come on, Dad. (INDISTINCT) (CELL PHONE CHIMES) GLORIA: Granddad. BUD: Hmm? What time is it? Early, but shouldn't we be going to the store? People will think it's closing after Christmas. It is. GLORIA: What? What are you talking about? The store is closing after Christmas. You all are leaving, and I'm probably headed off to Pine Grove. Oh, come on, Granddad, snap out of it. That's rubbish. That's just it. I have snapped out of it. Must've been out of my mind these last few days. Hopefully it's only temporary insanity. You're not insane, Granddad. And I'm sorry I didn't believe you. And that's why Prancer took us to town last night. To show us those lights. So I'd believe like you. I do now. I really do. Gloria, forget about that deer. Okay? And the store. No, I am not going to forget about the deer and the store. You're the one who dragged me into this. We almost finished... Your mother was right, you know. You could've been hurt real bad last night. But I wasn't. No. But you could have been. You're not listening to me. You listen to me! It's over. You understand? Over. But what about... I don't want to hear another word about that deer. (SOBBING) (WHISPERS) Hey, guys, are you awake? (LOUDLY) Hello! Oh, my gosh! Gloria. What's going on? Mom and Dad aren't telling me and Tyler anything. Okay, I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything. But you've just got to help me with something first. Yes, of course. Tell me everything. GLORIA: Okay, so there's this reindeer, like an actual one. And it flew over Granddad's truck. And then, last night... Showtime. (CROWS CAWING) GERALD: Dad's not coming out of his room, then, huh? Nope. We knocked on his door and he said he just wanted to be alone, so... (PHONE RINGS) Hello? SALLY: Hi, this is Sally. Can I speak to Mr. McShane? He can't come to the phone right now, Sally. Can I help? Oh. Um, it's about this video. Some people who've seen it are calling the store. They're asking about this deer and the Christmas lights. I'm not sure what to tell them. Uh, video? I don't know anything about a video. Well, I just thought maybe Mr. McShane had something to do with it. I don't think so, but I can check it out and find out. Is that okay? SALLY: Okay. Okay. Bye. (PHONE RINGS) Hello. IFFY: Claire. Iffy. What's with this video, man? This is fantastic news. Iffy, I don't know anything about a video. Okay? Goodbye. IFFY: What about... (CALL DISCONNECTS) What's going on, Claire? I have no idea. GLORIA: Enjoy. (CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYS OVER VIDEO) Hey, guys, we've got a very important announcement to make. Betty and Bud's Hardware Store is not closing. I repeal, we are not closing. GLORIA: And you can help. Come to the store today and meet the real Prancer! What the... Is that a deer? Yeah. HALEY: And we need loads and loads of lights, so bring all the lights you've got 'cause we're going to make Betty and Bud's Hardware Store... The most happiest, brightest place in the whole world! So come today so we can see you there. And we're gonna have carol singing with Tyler on the piano! TYLER: Oh, no, you didn't. And if you don't come today, you're gonna miss out on some real Christmas magic. See you guys there! BOTH: Tyler! Why shouldn't we have made the video? GERALD: At the very least, you should've talked to me before you did it. You'd have said no, Dad. Maybe I would. Maybe I'm afraid... HALEY: Did you even watch the video? Can you believe what that deer did to the lights on the main street? Haley? Come on. That's done with some sort of special effect. I knew you would say that. ERICA: Haley! No, you're either part of the problem or part of the solution. Which is it going to be for you? GERALD: Why are you singling me out? Gloria said you hired a hunter to kill the deer. BUD: It's suffocating up there. Can't hardly breathe, it's so damn hot. That right there, that's why we made the video. Granddad, I made you something. It's okay, you can read it later. Hurry up! Come on. TYLER: Okay. It's not that heavy. Got them? Got 'em. He goes in there. Okay, let's see here. (ENGINE STARTS) Are you going to get us all killed? No. Never drove in the winter before, though. (EXCLAIMS) Haley. It's okay. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) It's okay. Okay, let's do this again. What's wrong? What's wrong? The kids have just taken off in Claire's car. Hold on, Ger. I'll go after them. But why? Because you're way too upset. Know what you can do? Go stop Finn Wally from going after Prancer! Prancer? You're calling him Prancer now? You don't actually think that deer caused those lights to turn on, do you? Want to know what I think, honey? A little magic can take you a long way. (CHUCKLES) (DOOR CLOSES) What's that? Uh, this is a book Gloria made. I found it on Dad's desk. It's all about what those two have been up to this week. Let me see that. Haley, look out, that's a car! HALEY: (SCREAMS) Oh, my God! (BRAKES SQUEAL) (HORN BLARING) Oh, my God! What was that? I have no clue, Tyler! That was the wrong side of the road! What? It's not my fault! CLAIRE: This is your mother. You call me back right now. Do you hear me? Man. Nobody is answering me. Gloria, Erica. Erica's probably still driving. (SIGHS) What's wrong? I'm the bad guy in this story. Yeah. Damn. WALLY: Good night forever, Mr. Reindeer. Finn Wally always gets his man. (PRANCER BELLOWS IN DISTANCE) Oh, my gosh, it has 100 views. There's going to be so many people. You're a terrible filmmaker. Great. Nobody's here. IFFY: Gloria. Great news about the video and that deer. Iffy. Who are you? Iffy Natter. Oh, I'm Haley, Iffy Natter. Are you going to help us put the Christmas lights out? Yeah. Well, if enough people turn up, that is. IFFY: Well, people in Bright ridge, hopefully, yeah. TEVIN: I think I saw some Christmas lights around... Yeah. Here. (LAUGHS) Nice one, Tevin. Well, let's get started. That's for the back. WOMAN: Get inside, it's cold. Where is the deer? WOMAN: Okay, come on, let's go. BOY: The video said there was going to be a reindeer. GLORIA: We found some more. STU: There's plenty of lights. It's nice. Look. No, Stu, come on. We haven't even started. We need the whole place to be covered with Christmas lights. Here come more troops. HALEY: Hey, they brought lights. They're okay, Claire. I'll call you back when we've had words. (ERICA CLEARS THROAT) MAN 1: Hello. MAN 2: Good morning. WOMAN 1: Hi, Iffy. Guys, how's it going? WOMAN 2: Merry Christmas. Thank you. (BOTH CHUCKLE) GLORIA: Tevin, we can't have tangled lights. Come on, back to work. Listen, Dad. All want is for you to feel the way you did when Mom was still with us. You were happy back then. I've always been good with numbers, you know, practical things. Flights of fancy, though, it's kind of the deep end for me. But look, I finished checking the store's books like you wanted me to. There's a decent amount of debt there. And it'll be a challenge to sort it all out. I want to help you. With the store. I got a few ideas that might help turn things around, and I just wanted you to know that. And as far as the retirement home goes, well, Claire and I have been talking, and we're gonna work something out so you can stay here, and you'll be safe. 'Cause that's the most important thing. That you're safe. I love you, Dad. Okay, uh, I better go. There's a hunter out there I need to, you know... Before he does any damage I'll regret for the rest of my life. You should watch the video on there. The kids made it for you. (SIGHS) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) Sure about this, Ger? I mean, do you even remember how to ride one of these? Well, we're about to find out. (ENGINE SPUTTERS) Hmm. (ENGINE RUNNING) Wish me luck. Whoa! It's fast. (CONTINUES EXCLAIMING) (YELLS) I got this! Good luck. (GIGGLES) (PIANO TUNING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) When are you ever going to play that thing? Where's Mom and Haley? Oh. They're out helping out with the lights. You two are from that video. (CHUCKLES) (GASPS) Where's the deer? When's it gonna be here? Oh, the deer. Oh, Prancer's coming, don't worry. It's coming. The reindeer's coming. You don't really think the deer's going to come, do you? Oh, I do hope he does. (PIANO TUNING) (HUFFS) (GUN COCKS) (GRUNTING SOFTLY) What the... (SNOWMOBILE APPROACHING) Not this time. This time you are going down. Finn! Stop! WALLY: Get out of the way, McShane! Put the rifle away! WALLY: The deer is mine! Finn, your contract's canceled. Do you hear me? WALLY: Nobody's gonna stop me! Oh! Typical! Thought we fixed this. (ENGINE SPUTTERS) (GRUNTS) Deck the halls With boughs of holly Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la Um, Iffy, what's going on? I called these guys in case we have a problem. What sort of problem? So many lights are being put up, we could overload the circuit. We might have to take some of them down. No, we're not taking any down, and we need them all. I know you want all the lights, Gloria, but the infrastructure's shot here in Bright ridge. What does that even mean? We turn on all the lights on Main Street at the same time, the whole town could go dark. Ugh! Dad? What are you doing? O Christmas tree O Christmas tree Thy leaves are so unchanging O Christmas tree O Christmas tree Merry Christmas. Bye. Bright ridge people, they're the best in the whole wide world. That's my 10th spring pre-order. Whoa! I know. Gold, yes? WOMAN: Yes, please. (PLAYING JINGLE BELLS) (SINGING) Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one horse open sleigh, hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one horse open sleigh Hear that, Gloria? Music. What's wrong? Well, what do you think, Haley? None of the lights are working. Prancer's nowhere to be seen and nothing is going according to my plans. But the store is jammed. So what? If only... If what? If Granddad was here. We did all of this for him. All these people are here for him. I've got videos. He'll see what went down. Just doesn't feel the same. MAN: This is the last fuse. WOMAN: If this doesn't work, I'll blow my fuse. I'm trying here, I'm trying. WOMAN: Please, fix it! You fix it. Damn box! (ALL GASP) Oh, my God. (ALL CHEERING) (ALL GROAN) Oh, my gosh. WOMAN: What happened? CHILD: What's going on? (CAR DOOR OPENS) (GASPS) Granddad, you came. I had to. I had to thank you for that beautiful book. Your grandma would have loved that book, too. (PEOPLE GASPING) Look, a reindeer. (HUFFING) BUD: Hey, there. Remind you of somebody you know? You finally came. No animal ever got the better of Finn Wally. No animal is about to now, neither. (GRUNTS) GERALD: Finn, are you crazy? Put the riffle away! (PEOPLE EXCLAIM) WALLY: Just get off! Get off! I'm finishing the job, whether you like it or not, McShane. BUD: Hey. Santa? (PEOPLE CHEERING) (POLICE SIREN WAILING) WALLY: You've done it now, old man. You've done it now. OFFICER: You're under arrest, Wally. I'm under arrest? What about these two? You have the right to remain silent. I know my rights! You have the right to an attorney. Who I will call as soon as I can... What you do not have the right to do is hunt in the middle of town... You don't have to read me my rights every time I'm arrested. OFFICER: ...and endanger citizens you idiot! (PEOPLE CHEERING AND CLAPPING) That was awesome, Dad. Aw, thanks, honey. That was nothing. If your grandfather hadn't... No. You're the one that stopped Wally from shooting. I only threw one punch. I think it's time to celebrate. ALL: Yes! ERICA: You need a hot chocolate. You're right. I think I do. Come on. (SINGING) We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year Good tidings we bring Well, look at you. Should I call you Thomas or Santa? You can call me whatever you like. How about some hot cider, Nancy? In a minute. I want to say hi to some people. Then I want you to tell me all about this deer. It's a deal. What's that supposed to mean? We're just having a conversation. Hey, come. There is something I want to talk to you about. You know, I'm sorry, right, about everything I've done this past week. Oh, honey. No, no, no. I know. Okay. I know why you did all those things. And I know that it's kind of been really tough for us lately. It was mostly because of Dad. I read the text. You did? Oh. You know that Germany's not too far away, right? And that he can still be part of your life. Yeah, but he hasn't been for a while now. Um, I don't think he's coming back. Oh, I'm so sorry, honey. I'm so sorry. I should have talked to you about this sooner. But you know what? I've been thinking. Hey. Your granddad, he's going to need some extra help, right? We thought maybe we could get him a nurse, but... And then I suggested that maybe you and I stay here. I thought you'd never say that. Oh, we can stay for a while, Gloria. Or maybe for... Ever, maybe? I love it here. I love the people, I love the town, I love the woods. Bright ridge already feels like home. Yeah? Yeah. Well, do you wanna go tell Granddad? Yep. Oh. Everybody seemed to clear out pretty fast. Yeah, well, your star attraction left. Oh, Granddad, I've got something really important to tell you. Shoot. Okay, so me and Mom want to stay here with you, maybe? What do you mean, stay? You know what I mean. Live here with you. Uh, well, I don't... I mean... No, no, no. I get what you mean. You don't want us here. No, no, no. Of course I do. It would be, uh... It would be fantastic. But, um, don't you think it would get kind of boring living here? Granddad, more exciting things have happened in Bright ridge in less than a week than in ten years in London. Oh. And either way, I love you. I don't want to be anywhere else. I love you, too. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Um, all right. But if you're going to be living with me, we have to set up some ground rules. You understand? Okay. Good idea. Can't be such slob. You can't be buzzing around me all the time. I need my space. Okay, then you can't be such a grump. Ah, yeah, you have to, um... You have to, um... Whoa. BUD: Oh. (GLORIA GASPS) BUD: Bloody brilliant. GLORIA: Uh... (BUD CHUCKLES) BUD: I think it's rubbing off on me. (GLORIA GIGGLES) I'm gonna go tell everybody, okay? GLORIA: Once upon a time, there was a couple named Bud and Betty. They owned a hardware store in the heart of town. But one Christmas, Betty wasn't there anymore, and Bud forgot how to feel Christmassy. That was until Prancer, the magical reindeer, appeared and Bud saw him fly. Like, actually fly. Prancer showed Bud that he needed to let some light back into his life again and reminded him Betty's always with him when his family and friends are too. (CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING) Got a feeling that Christmas day is near And the spirit of Santa Claus is here Such a wonderful time When the snow is in town It's a hell of a thrill When the sleigh bells sound It's the time of the year For fleeting glances When the guy in the stall Says "Merry Christmas" What a glorious night Singing O Tannenbaum To be cozy and warm When the snow is falling down It's a wonderful time Betcha more than a dime The city bell's gonna chime The Christmas star's Gonna shine And old folks singing in rhyme Merry Christmas It's the time of the year For fleeting glances When the guy in the stall Says "Merry Christmas" What a glorious night Singing O Tannenbaum When you're cozy and warm And the snow is falling down What a wonderful time Betcha more than a dime The city bell's gonna chime Christmas star's gonna shine And old folks singing in rhyme Merry Christmas
