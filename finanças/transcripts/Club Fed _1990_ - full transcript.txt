your bungalow apparently you've been making an awful lot of calls to switzerland not me the only long-distance calls i made were to south yemen fair and norway and that's only because i accidentally dialed too many numbers well apparently all these calls were made right around noon time it's almost new now why don't we go back to your bungalow [Music] this is ridiculous gracias it's a shame that gracias is the only word i speak or understand in spanish me too what are we going to do if only we had something else to go on besides deposit slips and my phone well i have a feeling that any second

i never hear it mean exactly however someone is picking up this phone and transferring funds into a dummy account under your name i don't have any proof i'll bet that burke boyle is implicated in all this somehow morton boyle why do you think he's involved well when you've been doing this as long as i have you tend to have a visceral deep-seated inborn innate intuitive instinctive inherent intrinsic i don't know what you call it premonition for lack of a better word i think i'm gonna pay mr boyle a little visit i'll meet you at the party this shouldn't take me very long can i go with

boyle opened up two savings accounts one under angelica's name and one under his he stole money from the club fed charity fund and and deposited it into her account using the phone from her bungalow

circuits this bomb is not going up how did you know what to do when i lived with louie he used to get bumps into him all the time oh you lived with my [Music] i think i managed to unbutton my wrong sleeve who do you want to donate your organs to maybe we should reconsider that bowling idea that sounded like a lot of [Music] [Music] fun any dying requests i'd like to get married have children of a big house [Music] wait wait wait you wouldn't hit a girl with glasses on would you please let her take her glasses off first i'll let you take your glasses off you're gonna die before you can see your life pass before you [Music] yeah i was right about that sleep what happened to her all right it's a long story come on let's get out of here you really are suffering you know that i don't know what was more impressive you beating up that neanderthal woman or deserving the bomb i've been beating up welcome ladies and gentlemen i've called this press conference to make the public aware of what has been going on here at club since its opening the fbi has had a an undercover agent posing as a convict working behind the scenes and due to his fine work we have exposed the corrupt system of this so-called penal institution matter of fact we have compiled conclusive proof that one of the inmates namely angel nickaposalapalooza has been stealing money from club fed that had been designated for charity i promise you that she will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law this just goes to show you that once a criminal always a criminal and this mickey mouse operation is nothing more than a waste of the taxpayers money we should never pass never give preferential treatment to crooks just because they happen to be rich now we can put them back where they belong in the first place behind bars and we will close the gates of club fed forever [Music] something very disturbing is ultimately brought to my attention it seems that this uh pair of bumpulos was not alone in her operation there was another person besides puzzle octopus who was misappropriating funds and what is so shocking and so disheartening is that he is not one of the criminals he is as i was saying what is so shocking and so is his heart [Music] i used to think that it was a close personal friend of mine we used to eat at each other's houses for dinner no i set him up with his third wife when i was sick he donated a kidney coal in his flea now i know that he is a criminal and an attempted murderer he is none other than bird boy i am agent 976 lovely pink pup and aromatic spray the undercover agent assigned to this case and i have proof that yes there was a misappropriation of funds but it was vince hooligan and bert boyle who are responsible not angelica topless now i have been here and i have been part of this system i have seen hardened lifelong criminals rehabilitated before my very eyes club fed should be allowed to continue because club bed works [Applause] before club fed i was vain and materialistic i was very much into my looks all i wanted was diamonds furs a winter retreat in palm springs ski chalet in saint maritz park avenue apartment assorted vintage touring sedans lately honey i think they get the idea okay well my point is that i wanted those things and i didn't care how i got them now i still want those things but i care how i get them i think everybody should spend at least six months at club fed to learn the difference between right and wrong and to acquire knowledge self-respect and [Applause] [Music] sophistication [Music] wow thanks to all of you i'm going to leave here a different [Music] [Applause] person not only do i regret everything that i've done but i also intend to pay back all the people that i've taken advantage of as i know we all want to do hallelujah thank you for coming to club fed harrison and the reverend lived happily ever after fbi director vince hooligan got 20 years in a maximum security prison where he commissioned his mother to write his memoirs sally ridge was never discovered burt boyle has been running away from the law for over 20 years he's never been captured but has however won marathons all
