I was born just a few blocks from where I live now, in central Christchurch. This is my account of what happened here over the last year. It's a film I could never have planned to make. Police communications, you're speaking with Mal. Hello, Andy here, it's ambulance coms. Hi. Earthquake, can you feel that. Oh my gosh, oh, shit, oh my gosh. Oh, my gosh. - Hello. Control here. - What the fuck was that? Are you okay in ambulance there? Are you okay? It's half past four in the morning and the house has just shook. Christchurch has just had a massive, massive earthquake. John Risto, the duty seismologist with Geonet has the preliminary details. Well, at the moment I'm still locating it right now so I really don't have much information other than it looks like it was an extremely large earthquake somewhere in the South Island. My hands were just like that and I felt, oh golly gosh, you know, I've never experienced anything like this before. - I jumped in here, into the doorway and held on and literally the whole, everything was falling and rocking, it took me all my time to stay on my feet. Originally I run to the door over there and I was told to get back to my desk and to get under my desk, which I did. - Show us. - Do you want me to demonstrate? - Yes. - Sure, okay. I was on my phone. - You took a call under here? - No, I was phoning my husband. I was like, are you okay? The first man I looked after was chest pain, he said that part of his house had fallen down on him and his family. We thought that there would have been deaths, multi casualty trauma all round the city. An hour or an hour and a half after the earthquake we realised that there hadn't been widespread casualties in Christchurch. The feeling was somebody's looking after us. We have been big time blessed. I called up home and I spoke to my mother and I said, we are all good we are all safe and sound. A 4.5, 5 in the Richter Scale that's very destructive in India, so a 7.1, according to them, none of us would have survived, so it's a miracle as far as they're concerned. When the house really started shaking I started to think isn't this the time when they're meant to be running out of the bedroom trying to get us out of bed. - I grabbed the dirty washing basket on the way out door and we went out onto the driveway. - That was good presence of mind. - Well, what do you do in the middle of the night when you've got no clothes on. She had a bit of a cold so felt sorry for her. - Really tough parents, and pulled her into bed with us. - Ten, fifteen kilos of plaster basically landed exactly where her head would have been. You're quite lucky, mate. You're the luckiest little girl, aren't you? I was baking. You know how they tell you to stand under a doorway in an earthquake, I tell you what, mate, when it's moving this way and that way and ready to punch you in the eyeballs, the last thing you do is stand under a doorway. The water definitely reached above tyres, eh? Yeah, it was, top of the tyres type thing, it was decent. - A four wheel drive was necessary. Yes. - Yeah, I know we've all of a sudden justified our inner city four wheel drive. Kathy came over and she was screaming out, Kerry, Kerry, and I said, it's all right, Kathy. And I raced over to the gate and fell into here and I was up to here in liquefaction. It was just, yeah, absolutely horrific. And your house is ... - Stuffed. Absolutely stuffed. The reinforcement for the parapet was due to go on today. - Oh, no. More coming? - Yeah. - Students? - Students, yeah. So how did you know to do this? Facebook. - They just knocked on the door about five minutes ago so great to have their help. Sam Johnson started up a page and then that pretty much went to everyone. We started a Facebook group on Saturday night and I invited about 200 people to come and help volunteer and from that it's grown to about 6,000 people. - So, is that how it works, is it, someone sees it on someone's page and then it goes onto your page? - Yeah, it's kind of like the modern form of word of mouth. - Your idea? - Yes. I think it's important to mobilise students and get them together over a time like this. - Tell us about this word liquefaction. Did you know about that word already? No, not previously, no. This is liquefaction, it comes up through the cracks, but I don't remember enough about it to tell you. They are absolutely wonderful to come like this I'd like to give them something. No, you don't have to give them anything. Oh. I'm not on my own. There are people out there that care so, oh, god. - It's completely munted. - You're house? Yeah. Our house is on a tilt, cracks in the walls. - Half my house is pretty bad and it might have to get demolished. Some of my mum's friends have cried for us about our house being so destroyed. About half an hour after the quake Cherise went outside and there was water up to her mid calve and she thought there had already been a tsunami but that was just the water that had come up out of the ground and as the water came up the house just sank. No one's looked at the house but it doesn't feel to me that you can live in it. There's no water, there's no sewage, there's no power, there's no phone. I'm doing a recce but sometime in the next couple of days someone like a building inspector from the council's going to inspect this house. - Okay. - Damage here, would you call it minor, major? - Major. - Okay, major. Sorry, my brain's been a bit mushed for the last few days, it's coming right, but. - Yeah, mine's pretty mushy too. - Excuse me, thank you. - Thanks. You were here on your own? - Yep, I went down the stairs and a shower of plaster, my one aim was to get hold of the torch. The only place the torch was was in the cloakroom, the most dangerous part of the house so I walked in as a stone fell about me. - So no wasting time? - A new first floor is what we're after. There's another one, was it? It's all right, Bert, where are you, Bert? Poor dog is terrified. That was quite a good shake, wasn't it? It was indeed. This is MoreFM, how are you doing, this morning? Increasing high cloud, a chance of some light rain northerlies after that gorgeous day yesterday. Wasn't that a pearler? Celebrate the great work you're doing. - For the first time in the last few nights I've heard earthquakes in a way I've never heard them before. I can hear them coming. I've heard the sound. It's a spooky sound. It just goes whooom, bang, like that. And did you know these people who came from Karamea? - No. They just came over all that way and gave you water -- oh, oh, that's a good one. Oh, my god. - Okay, let's move over. - Oh my God. It's all right. You're fine, you're fine. It's alright, it's alright. - It's alright it's calmed down now. Good girl. Are you okay, Taylor? - Yeah. - You are a very brave girl. - Thanks - You are a brave girl. There's a level of violence in this earthquake that's something I've never felt anywhere in my life before. I just feel absolutely bloody helpless. And I think we all feel that, actually. Absolutely helpless. When stuff actually started to fall to bits it was like completely deafening. I couldn't hear anything. I felt myself rolling to the right hand side and then my wall blew out and I'm on the ground, down this, yeah, down this cliff face of a house. I thought I'd fallen through the floor because I saw a window frame so I assumed I must be looking out of the house but in actual fact I was looking into the house. The bruises and stuff I suffered it was pretty minor. People expected me to break a leg or something like that. With material things it doesn't matter. We can replace, but when you lose your family, which means a lot to me, I would have been totally devastated. People are just like, are you the kid that fell out of the house, and, oh, we were talking about you at the pub the other day, and stuff like that. So, yeah, - A few pats on the back? - Yeah. Yeah, it's cool, but then there's lots of people who make fun, you fell out of your house, but no it's all good. - How about the guys at school? - Yeah, it's pretty much that, shame you fell out of your house. But you can't expect any more from teenage boys. Come on over here. We're right in the fault zone. This way that's on one side of the fault, this way is on the other side of the fault, we're looking at an irrigation channel that used to be straight which now looks like this, because actually the fault goes straight across the irrigation channel. The fault went right through this forest it broke those tree lines apart and now you can see, I mean those line of trees there, now line up about right here. It's another one of these areas that have been pulled apart. There was a fault lurking beneath the Canterbury plains that we did not know about that was capable of generating big earthquakes. This particular fault was 30, 35 kilometres long. It extended down 10, 15 kilometres and that whole thing moved. And the consequence of that movement resulted in 7.1 earthquake. In places around here the actual ground acceleration, the rate at which the ground was oscillating back and forth during the earthquake was greater than the force of gravity. So if you were in this forest during the earthquake you would have been tossed off your feet. Christchurch is built on - it's a very complex environment, it's a constantly changing environment. In the distance you've got the snow-capped southern alps, these mountains that have grown over millions of years from all these earthquakes and then just on this side of the southern alps you can see these green folded aprons of what we would call the foothills, which are also formed by the buckling and the faulting of rocks beneath the plains. And then you've got the Canterbury plains themselves, this relatively flat apron of gravels which are being shed from the mountains, being carried down rivers, being brought down from when glaciers melt, big floods carried the big gravels out onto the plain. And they grade down towards Christchurch. When you get close to Christchurch you have this interfingering of this material which started as a rock in the southern alps. It broke down into a smaller rock and eventually into a grain of sand and been deposited out in this area. And that's what we built a city on, eh? That's where we built our city. They left their homes in England to build new homes in a new land. - North, south, east and west from the square they go, down long straight streets laid out in regular patterns by the pioneers long ago. This was a vast wetland laced with rivers and springs and a huge amount of artesian water bubbling up around it as well as the rivers flowing into it. The place was a pulsating larder and hugely attractive on that account. The European, Pakeha settlers settlers in the 19th century didn't have any great particular respect for the land itself or for its values, they wanted to convert it. They saw this region as a place to reshape and so they drained it and turned it into the garden city. Christchurch, New Zealand's city of the plains. Here, when spring comes to Canterbury, daffodils bloom gay and golden in the woodland of Hagley Park. When I was a teenager all this land was horse paddocks. I used to come down here and ride horses with my friends and it was quite swampy and marshy then. It's pretty bad in the hallway here but it's sort of spilt into every room and it's sort of spilled out into the corners and into the wardrobes. We're paying a mortgage on it but we can't live in it. It's insane, absolutely insane. See what this young fellow here, he's doing 15 to 20 blocked drains a day just by himself, that's why I've decided to buy him a nice new t-shirt, that's what the t-shirt says, the big pooman. Blocked drain guys are doing 80 to 85 hours a week. There's just hundreds to thousands of broken pipes throughout the city. We go wees in the back garden if nobody's looking but we go poos next door. This structure over here, again, this is nothing to do with the earthquake; it's been like that for 30 years. It looks as though it shouldn't work but it does. It's the architect Mountford's masterpiece. It's internationally recognised and it's probably the city's most architecturally significant building. I'm just pleased it's as intact as it is. We've got a problem with people collecting stuff and putting it on Trademe and I think you've got to get this stuff secured. There are many remarkable buildings around this city that are being destroyed unnecessarily in my opinion. - Do you know which pieces you're going to need - I'm Anna Crighton anyway. - Anna, Don Cameron, Anna. - Who's documenting the rubble? That's the mould from the window. Hey, guys. - Where shall we put these? - Down this side alley. This is exactly the sort of thing you don't want to see scooped up by a bulldozer and taken away to the dump. Here comes old Stevo. Hi ya, Stevo, how are you? - Thank you. All up here it all came back through here, all the bricks and things like that, landed all on the floor there like a big dump. Because I live and work here the next option was sleeping in the bath. Yep, and this was my bed, it was okay. This my mum, Pali, and this is my dad, Curtis. - Hello, how are you? Gidday. Hello. My parents slept here for about .. - Three weeks. - Three weeks. - Where did you sleep? Really, you slept in here? Did you have insurance at the time? - No, we don't have insurance. - No insurance? We just want to say thank you to all the people who have helped us, our friends, and the people in the community, thanks. Shit. The Catholic people in New Zealand regard this as really an astonishing building to be in New Zealand. We started work in the late '90s I think, and at that stage concluded that the best thing we could do would be to spend our money well, to tie the building together, what we call securing. - And if that strengthening work had not been done, then this would now be a heap of rubble. We had earthquake strengthening in 1999 and that's what saved this building, and it's thank God and the Christchurch City Council that they had the wisdom to earthquake strengthen Like they have I mean, this place is the icon of the city. I'm still dreaming about it and having dreams of more earthquakes and how I'm going to get out of the house that I'm in. I mean, they say you know, that there's not going to be another 7.1 earthquake, you know, for 16000 years or whatever, but there could be one in 5 minutes time also. Christ almighty that was huge, it was way bigger than the first one and the whole of the fucking town's in panic. There goes an aftershock. My god. - Holy shit, my god. - Man, these are huge, these are fucking massive. That one's going to fall over. - Away from the buildings. Get out in the middle. Just fucked. - Is everyone out of there? - Yeah. - Everyone's out of Piko's? - Yeah I just pushed her out the door, and as I pushed her out the back door I saw the fucking, you know, the piece of plaster and brick come down towards us, I was like just. Everyone's okay that I know here. Everyone okay that you know? I can't get hold of Reece. I don't know. He's at CTV and I don't know. - What do you want to do? Do you want to walk down with me? Yeah, are you going that way? I'll go that way and Phil - have you got a cellphone anywhere? - I've got my cell phone, I can't - Get hold of anybody. It was terrible, eh? Much worse than the first - Awful. Look at this building. It was pretty scary up on the fourth floor but I think we got everybody out. - Over there? - Security House, yeah. I work in that building there and I came out and they were crawling out of that broken window there. - Anyone injured? Well, they looked it, there was blood all over them. I mean down there there was a guy trapped in a car. - Smells like gas. - I can smell gas. There was gas around there as well. Okay, can you hear? Right oh, they're expecting more aftershocks. People sitting in the Square like this is not helping us. We need the Square cleared so we can get more emergency service vehicles in here, so we're asking people to leave the city. Now, with this event the best place to leave the city is down that street there. You understand? It's either that way or Hagley Park. You've got a choice. Now, can you please leave now. Thank you. Do you recommend I go back to my hotel or - no, take that - - You're not telling me a fucking thing. - Leave the city. - I've got to get to the kids. - Sorry, sweetheart? - I've got to get to the kids. - Where are they? - In St Albans. I don't know what's happening here at the moment I've just come from the police station down to here and I'm trying to help anybody I come across but I don't know.. I've haven't been down the other end of Colombo and Moorhouse but I need to get there to see if my mother's there to see if she's okay. I'm at the Cathedral. - You saw it come down? Yeah, there's some tourists up in there and there's a few people dead and a car got squashed. Um, There's two dead. There's people stuck on the seventh floor. There's people stuck on the tenth floor. Building's leaning towards us so we just want to make sure we're out of the road. We just need to keep moving people down towards Latimer Square and away from the inner city. So where were you? We were on the fifth floor CTV building and everything collapsed. Luckily I was sprinting towards the corridor and so I wasn't trapped on the outside walls and the whole building fell down to the left side, to the car park area. That's the building. Can you point to it? Over there. It's now on fire, actually, that building is actually now burning. Lots of smoke coming out. So it collapsed. We were on the fifth floor. Everybody from that room got out, actually. We've got one person left in there who was... - But there were people on the ground floor? I don't know. I really don't know. I'm hoping that they are - -- I don't know. It looks completely gone. It's completely smashed. There's nothing left from that building. I would love if we could find another structural engineer. I've just done an assessment of the lift core. I reckon it's standing - but if you can get someone. - I'll have a look for you. - That would be great. Another major earthquake has struck and this time people have died. The quake struck at 12.51 this lunch time, nine minutes to one. Police have confirmed there are fatalities as well as many injured. It happened at the worst possible time during the lunch hour. A 6.3 magnitude earthquake five kilometres deep and ten kilometres south-east of the city. One of the buildings, where rescuers are still trying to reach the trapped tonight is the Pyne Gould Corporation Building. The Press building behind the Cathedral also collapsed. It's feared there are many people trapped in the collapsed CTV building. The advice I've had so far is that 65 people have lost their lives. We can't rule out the death toll climbing from there. New Zealand may be staring down what is its darkest day as we take stock of a city that's been utterly wrecked. She explained to me that she was in Les Mills Gym and she watched the building next door come down and then I started thinking about where the CTV building is, because Mum's only just started working there, and I realised that's the building that my partner watched come down. And that was it, we couldn't get back in. No one would let us back in because of the army and I know they're doing their jobs but - when your mum's trapped under a whole lot of rubble you want to be as close as you can. So we've only just managed to get here now. The house is fine, yeah. It's just we felt safer together. We don't have any power but we're doing all our cooking on a barbecue and kitchen ware from down the road. The toilet, the toilet. Matthew really wants to show you the toilet. - There's the toilet. Like a thingy what you sit on. All I have to wear is suits at the moment so why not, nothing wrong with it. I like it. We're directing the traffic. You get three fire engines coming from different sides and they've all got their lights on so they all think think they're on right of way. And then, you know, you can probably imagine, so we just planted ourselves there so ever since we've just been here. - So you've volunteered and they've given you those vests. No, these are from our bedrooms. You had an orange vest? - Yeah, so we had orange vest. We just ran out here and we've been here ever since. It's good. We get water dropped off. -- Oh, my man. It's from the guys up the road. Really, from Steve and them? - No, the army guys got some dropped off They were just, we've got too much. So I was in there with a couple of people, couple of backpackers and heard the roar and the rumble and then, choo it followed us out basically. How close was that? Felt the wind at the back, yeah. - I'm leaving on Sunday to Auckland. - Going to leave our block of flats and my husband's going to his sister's place and I'm going to my daughters because each time we have an aftershock the building shakes that much more and I just think it's going to go so we're getting out while we can. It's terrifying. They took everything that was inside of, that I can't take and put in the car, to leave. I'm on my way up the road here to see what the Basilica's like, which is where I was once an altar boy. It's just like a city's gone, really, eh. The building's I've gone into for years and known so well just gone. And here's the Basilica. Oh my god. Oh. Oh. Everyone's just waiting, really, for what happens next. I suppose it's just, everybody's just happy that they're alive. The building has been searched. Just the rubble at the front has to be searched as well just so we can finalise the building. Street by street, house by house, trying to clear every house, make sure there's nobody's left behind. - Hello. It's your student army. - Oh, wonderful. - Where have you been? - Around the cordons, around the four avenues for the police, and the army personnel who are guarding. It's like a war zone. You drive up and you see a tank looming in front of you and it's like whoa. I just remembered, we had a officer that came looking for you today. - Did you? - Yeah. I was just in the car and they pulled up here and asked us where abouts we were, really. Yeah, we were kind of like, don't know. I think he went that way or that way. - Yeah, they told me not to film and I said, but I live here. It's heart breaking but it's lovely to see that as a community we're caring for each other, that's the biggest thing for me. This hall was completely empty two days ago, completely empty, nothing in here at all. Most of these ones have come in from Rangiora. Somebody's cooking out there and they're bringing them in on a private helicopter. Have you been blessed with too much, mate? Oh, never, never too much. It's just timing, you know. It just comes in big bulk sets like this. Some Wellington people decided that - they owned this bus - that they would put out a call to Wellingtonians to drop stuff off. They've filled the bus up, driven it to Christchurch. We just drove it down here last night basically and now we're dropping it off here today. But it was all the people of Wellington, the response was amazing. There was more than we could carry and it was unbelievable. What's your name? - Mark. - I'm Manu. Take care. - What have you found? A doll. Isn't she lovely. If there's been anybody who looks like they've got more than what you might anticipate, they'd need, a question or two to see how they're going reveals immediately that they're actually feeding the whole street. They're the able bodied person and they're here and they're helping the other neighbours who can't even manage to get out their drive. This didn't kind of happen because somebody sat down at a table and strategized about what should be delivered. This was people pouring out their hearts to each other and supporting people in a practical way where it was needed the most. And we couldn't have done it without this man here, senior seargent Roy Apthey, who I think is one of this country's heroes. - That's beautiful praises. Is this one man's response? - Yeah. Just doing a little bit to keep busy. It's a way to keep sane, isn't it? Absolutely. So your house is alright? - Not the most happiest camper, but we'll survive. Oh, that's the tap. - Yeah. Quite clever. We went to Mitre 10, gave them the pipes the other day and he's just made it go out to the front gate. And then people bring food at the front gate and toys today. You've got no children. - No, not yet, two coming so. - You're expecting twins. - Yeah. I think they're going to be adrenalin junkies. People have either togs or something on, no nakedness though. Have to get prescription repeat. I've had to go on the road a few times which I'm not really allowed to do but got here. You should have seen the amount of moving trucks this morning coming into the valley. It was horrific. You know, just truck after truck after truck. People clearing out? Going. Well, the epicentre's right behind us. We had a 4.3 this morning. I discovered I can fly without wings. Sorry. I flew. I literally flew. I was in the house and the whole house just went bang. I was gone. - That was this morning? - Yeah. Is that a car under there? It's been our house for close on 30 years. I'm too scared to even go through the door. - So it's been what, red stickered? - Yeah, it is. - Do you want to stay? - Oh yes, we'll be here if we have to live in a container. Twenty minutes. - I'll come back then. - I need a crescent, actually. - Do you? Maybe not a crescent but I've got a spanner. It's been good for people. They take a flat white and get back to normal life. Yeah, sure. Us guys all sort of sat here and talked about what's happened. Some people don't talk much about what's happened. They just happened to be in port when the quake struck They were going to an exercise further down the country with the army so, after the quake struck, the back of the Canterbury opened and a large stream of military poured out of the city offering help where they could. Parade, up. Caps. This time seven days ago, Canterbury was hit with a devastating force of nature, which has claimed many, many lives, buildings, livelihoods. 12.51, sir. I think it's time for us to return. Thank you for those who have gathered officially here and for citizens and townspeople of Lyttleton for coming. Our bell is no longer being heard at the moment, but let me tell you, Holy Trinity's bell will ring again over our village, waking all you bloody lot up at 10 o'clock every morning. Remember Owen Wright's family and Ian Polgesy's family as they grieve for their loved ones. He loved walking. That was his thing. He left at 12 ish and when the earthquake happened I just looked up at the Port Hills and just saw rock and dust It was really amazing to see because I hadn't been outside at the other earthquake. But if you had seen the hills and thought of someone up there walking, you would have known it wasn't going to be good. So I figured that I'd better go up and see whereabouts he'd got to. I was quite scared with the amount of rocks that had fallen and splintered but adrenalin kicks in and you're committed. Telly was wonderful, my dog, he found little pockets of the track and I saw a guy and described what Dad looked like. He said no, no, but you shouldn't be up here. And neither should he. But I continued up towards Cass Bay and then back around and then as I was telling Mum the other day, which the police said I must have imagined it, I heard whistling and I heard a lot of whistling. And whenever we went tramping we would take our whistles with us. But I knew Dad wouldn't have his whistle up there. But anyway, when I heard the whistling then I found him. And I saw his little shirt that he always wears when he goes away. And he was under a lot of rock and he was off the track because he obviously got pushed off and down. And Telly was in there cuddling him and yeah, we just took the rocks off him and tidied him up him up and yeah, I just cuddled him for a long time. Rang my sister. They don't know how Sarah was so brave and how she survived and how she - so much courage to be up there with all that falling rock and you know. - I went up there and wrote some stuff upon the rocks and my sisters' names and Mum and love you Dad and yep. You got hit pretty hard around here. Yeah, no power, no toilet. - Still no power and no toilet? - No sewage, no phone. In front of my kids, like all my kids, I've always been a strong person and I've always known that. But it's taken the earthquake to flip the other side of me, freak me out. There's my darling. This is my rock, my darling granddaughter. She's always been there for her nan. - Always protect her. - She was there with me. - On the day of the earthquake. - Not bad for a 12 year old, eh, my darling. I can't get hold of Mrs Rhodes. It's nice being driven around. - Isn't it? So you see people still living in tents. They feel more safer living in the tents. A lot of people wouldn't have telephones around here. A lot of households don't have a car. I just don't want to go into a multi-storey building. I know I have to go so if you would come with me that would be wonderful. I've missed what, three hospital appointments because I just don't want to go in there. I don't want to go on my own, that's for sure. I haven't been anywhere, except to Brighton, since the earthquake. So, I guess I'm still stressed. - Lots of people are feeling the same way as you are. - Yeah, I know. I cope all right during the day but the nights, the nights are real scary. Don't want to be on my own at night. This whole areas been a no-go area for a week because of the precarious position of Grand Chancellor just up here. The risk of that collapsing and knocking these other buildings over was just quiet high. - This one right here? - The one with the curtains hanging out the windows. People have ended up curled up in balls beside their desk, their workmate one desk over dives under their desk but right above her head was a big beam, the beam's come down gone right through the table, got her but her mate four feet away, who did exactly the same thing is fine. And we were pulling people out of PGG with a few scratches, walking out. The number that came out of PGG is absolutely amazing. What happens at that moment with you people? It's weighed up and the actions come from that There's none of this hero running into buildings crap. No. Everything's done in a calculated manner. But there must be times when you've got to make a call in the moment. - Yeah. - Heads or tails, definitely. At this stage it's DVI, it's dead victims identificaton That's through police. The remains here now, well, it's almost DNA type material and even then they're thinking that some of the people they may not be able to identify for years to come. They're the Japanese contingent. They're working in conjunction with our guys over here, Kiwi guys, and they've also had a large Chinese contingent because we've had Japanese, Chinese and New Zealand nationals on this particular site here. I had just left this kitchen and gone to the CTV building to the fifth floor, where my work is. So I left this place expecting to be back at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. We were used to aftershocks in that building from September but that day it simply exploded. There wasn't even a second for anyone to say, earthquake. I recall knowing I was buried and seeing jagged pieces of timber and debris over me and I could see one little shaft of light and when these extraordinary young policemen leapt onto the building within a matter of minutes they got us out and then sort of carried us down to the members of the public who were waiting below. And I was taken care of by a young man who'd been walking past, going to his gym training and a young reporter from the Star. It wasn't until later on that night, I think it was about 10 o'clock that I got power back on at home and I was watching the TV and they were talking about CTV and I didn't realise... they were showing a picture and I kept thinking when are they going to show the CTV building. And I didn't realise that that's what I was looking at because you couldn't recognise it. He was loving work. He had this position as news producer, he wasn't just a journalist anymore he had stepped up. We went to the hospital and registered him as missing because I mean this is getting on a bit, about 7 o'clock, and he was, he was missing. But I still didn't know if he'd been at work, if he'd been in the city, or he'd been somewhere else. It's not normal to see your husband go to work one day and then just never, ever, ever see him again. It's just not normal. Are you leaving that? It's only a year old. No, it's only this piece here. - Cool, mate. Are you the senior police officer. - Correct. - The owners are running down here as quickly as they can. They say it was not approved. Oh, it has been. It's written on these sheets. - Well, actually it doesn't say it's been - If you wanted to wait 10 minutes they would tell you that. - That's alright. Just give me a few minutes and I'll see what I can do. My partner just rang the owner to say sad to see it happening and she said, what, and they're running here as quickly as they can. - All the paper works there, the whole lot. Upper building and walls, avoid damage to structure. We didn't know that any of it was coming down. Are you the owners of the building? - We are. - Okay. From my understanding, they said that it was adjoining buildings and this building was going to get demolished, and that one was going to remain, that's from my understanding. And that it was approved. Nobody contacted me or briefed me at all. - Okay. It's been signed off by the national controller of defence. - They've got full authority according to the Council. - Yeah, so all we're going do is just take the top off. We're not going to touch any of the bottom structure of the building. At least we should be able to go in and salvage some of the stuff that's in there. What did they tell you to do? I honestly can't comment on that. - You can't? - No, I was just told to make the building safe and follow the directions. - You didn't know just to pull down the top only, did you? You thought you were pulling down the whole thing. - Well, it's a bit of a grey area, maybe. You know, actually, I love this building but I'm just about over bricks. Roger Sutton, CEO of Orion, is arriving with the prime minister in about 10 minutes. He said. He's just rung me. He'll talk you through. If you're going to enter the site, you must have a hard hat on. - Usually when the prime minister does these things, we are in front of him. - Oh, okay. I don't want anyone walking backwards. There are too many trip hazards there to be walking backwards. - No one walk backwards. We were worried about this area previously? Hold that for us. Those four big cables were damaged, the overhead line was replaced. We've also been building a big underground cable through here and we started that after September 4th because we thought something like this might happen again. That's actually from the CBD. It's an oil filled cable. You can just see how it's blown itself apart with the land movement. It's amazing, isn't it. So working on one those takes weeks. Is underground worse or better? - Much worse. Worse. Well look, the overheads are designed to move in the wind. - That's right. - So the underground ain't designed to move. And how do you design it so it can move? Got any ideas? - That's right. - Hello. I'd like you to move some elastic cable for me, you know. It's just like a stupid idea. - Yeah, it's never going to work. You got power yet? - No, I've got nothing. - How's your house? - Oh, pretty tipped but not bad. - Are you married? - Yes, but that's all finished. Okay, going the same way as the house then? Yeah, I've got a red sticker on me. - Well, keep up the good work. You're doing a great job, it's not easy. If you or your staff get out of town for a few days just give us a yell because there's hundreds of thousands of people in the North Island offering places for people to get away for the weekend and you guys probably need to do that every now and then. Thanks for that. I'll pass it on. Thanks very much. Kia ora, are you around, Shane? - How are you? - You sleeping in, mate? - Yeah, welcome to my bivvy. You're living outside under a tree. Yeah. A walnut tree. But you're still smiling, Shane? Yeah, I am. I actually consider myself really fortunate to tell you the truth. They've pulled out probably about 20 businesses here. People can say it's a major setback but you just bounce back How was it last night? It was okay. The rain wasn't too bad but still cold. But lucky enough Dave, he's a chap next door here who, he gets up at about 4 o'clock. I go and have a coffee with him and have a bit of a talk. So you've stayed here since the earthquake? Yeah, and before that. There's all the memorabilia of Memphis House. So when you last came through, what you saw was on the wall this is now just lying under tarpaulin. Little pot bellies, they told us to get rid of them but I tell you what, they're bloody great when you need them. - Why have you stayed here, Shane? There's a huge difference between those who are insured and those who aren't, you know, depending on your circumstances of life, you might have personal insurance but you can't afford business insurance, so yeah, people like me, they're all just living a little bit rough. What you find out is that after the earthquake you have very little rights to your own property. The landlord -- I mean, for instance I've been at my place for 17 years, he had more rights to go through a red sticker than what I had. Sticker than what I had. He could go and visit the property, you know, go on board with engineers. I had to stand out on the street. So therefore you've just got to take matters into your own hands. And you don't want to break the law and things like that, there's a certain respect for police. But you were going to lose everything, eh? Yeah, exactly, that's what I mean. So the whole street, the whole neighbourhood's become emptied out. - This one has. This was evacuated by the police and I think they're all yellow stickered so no one's allowed to live here. There's a concern about land damage right the way through here. The helicopters are going back and forth and back and forth and the sirens are going and it was like world war three, that's one of the reasons I left. My nice quiet neighbourhood where I've lived on and off for over 40 years. What am I, three days short of three weeks. I've got power but I've got nothing else. - Same as me, Rob. We should be able to trade power for water. A new barter system. And if I control it right from the beginning I'll make more than anyone else, it's a well-known fact. What you guys have got in common is the fact that you're still here. - Flight or fight, that's all there is to it. You can't change it either. And it's as funny as to watch but you know, and you can't be judgemental on it, this is where people are. They either run or they stay. And if you stay well that's what your job, you stay and fix up and make it ready for the others to come back. That's how we're programed. Yeah, that's how we're programmed to be like that and in a general way the man will stay and fight and the women will flee with the children, which is absolutely just. - That's the man thing to do. The man thing is to protect your home, to protect your base and have something that's basic. I was in the toilet. - Me too. - There's no tables. I know. And there's nothing to get under, except the stalls, and that's not that good. - Where's this building, mate. Oh, this was Press building. Oh, you were in the Press building? - So, that was pretty intense. And obviously I had to come over the hill and everything like that. I still thought that we'd lost 20 to 30 people. How did you get over the hill? I actually, a lot of people were following the bridle path up in you know, just the normal route, but there was a lot overhanging rocks so I actually went through farmland, along the ridge line, thinking any rocks that could fall would peel off the ridge line and go down into the valley and I did the same on this side here. And then you read in the paper the next day that people died, but there was no way I was walking under those overhanging rocks. - You got back at about 6 o'clock, didn't you? - It was about -- I found you after about 3 ½ hours so it was nearly 4 o'clock. After what, three years of marriage we hadn't run and hugged each other for a while. - It was a great feeling. Clear us a path so we can run out if the big one comes. - No one got injured here? - No, everyone got out. Should get that back to the owner. It became a little meeting house for people really in Lyttelton and a place for people to hang art and band practices were held here. It was much loved, mate. Yeah, there were lots of parties and socialising. It was a real family here. I'll be more delicate. We'd had lunch and Don had gone back into the garden to see if there were any more raspberries for the evening meal and that was the time which the earthquake happened. When I came downstairs and came out and walked along here I looked up there and I thought if Don was still in the garden he would surely be dead because there was no way he could have survived that great pile of rocks. And that turned out to be the case so that was a bit shattering because I had expected that we'd have another good ten years happily living together. - In your lovely new house. - But the Lord had other ideas. This is where 36 people stayed for three days and two nights. In here. In here, on the floor on mattresses. That night we slept between them to comfort them because the rocks kept hitting us, and the next night too. And the staff were scared, but the residents -- like I was lying between two, they would rub my back and reassure me that it was going to be okay. It was the most wonderful lesson I've ever had, about the elderly. You were there to look after them. And they looked after us. And they never -- they were just reassuring. They said their prayers. They weren't alarmed. They were happy with getting a drink, getting a cup of soup. They were just absolutely wonderful. And then on the Thursday we took, 18 of them went to Dunedin. And they got on the bus and they were just so brave and they went away and they thanked me and kissed us all and left. Apparently the studies have shown that old people get through these things with dignity and help other people and then a lot of them die. And that's what's happened to our residents. A lot of them have died since. This building, having now been declared deconsecrated and secularised I declare to be no longer subject to my canonical jurisdiction. Well, it's gap filler time again, friends. Maybe one of the best things to come out of the last earthquake was gap filler and I'm glad to be here today with you. Is this all liquefaction? - This is it. They're all from up north with the backing of the open wanunga since day one of the earthquake they've given us a guaranteed crew of four each day and then alongside that they've also brought down six of these guys to help. So they've come from other parts of New Zealand. Yeah, we've had people down from Auckland, Waikato, all over the show. - These people haven't got anything much and they're still living in this sort of stuff. We can't understand this sort of stuff where we're from. We haven't had anything like this. If it was me I probably would have just left. I wouldn't have come back. - In Canterbury, the people, eh, good on them, they're really getting in and they're sticking to it, that's us Kiwis eh, we're a proud nation. So, no, kia ora. - Good on you mate. So we're not far from an epicentre, you reckon. - Yeah, I mean the epicentre was located somewhere on this ridge here. As you know these locations are always approximate. Every one of these aftershocks is an earthquake. I mean that's an important thing to remember is that every time we feel the ground shuddering beneath us it is a, it's because a fault plain of all varying sort of shapes and dimensions is slipping and generating seismic energy which then comes to the surface. So it's almost like a story of fractured glass beneath us. You know, all these fractures and all sorts of different orientations and how they link up define the fault zone. - Are we out of the woods yet? - None of us would say for sure, with our current state of knowledge, that we're done and that we're not going to get any other big earthquakes. And I guess the other important thing is even when this sequence is done there many hundreds of faults around New Zealand that contribute some source of hazard to Christchurch going forward. Now, it's not going to be the same level of hazard that was associated with the February earthquake but we have this opportunity now, this window, to make ourselves more resilient so that when the alpine fault goes, and it will go, that Christchurch is the world's most earthquake resilient city. One of the blessings is that even though there's been death and injury in the city none of that happened in the cathedral and I'm ever lastingly grateful for that. Yes, indeed. The statue of the blessed Virgin Mary in the north tower facing inwards, after the earthquake the statue had turned 180 degrees and was facing outwards over the city. - So do you see that as significant. - Well, a lot of people do. It's okay, everyone's okay. That was big, wasn't it? Out at Sumner, half the hill has come down, check it out, fucking massive. On the floor again. - This is the third time, isn't it, that Avonside's copped it. Just on the phone with my sister in law in Calgary just letting her know we're okay. We've just had two really big earthquakes during the day. The house is fucked again. House was just bouncing around like crazy. I felt like the house was going to just fall down around us and we just grabbed each other and hung on and waited for it and now we've got liquefaction just like the 6.3 one, just all round us, so we're sort of back to square one again. I'd say it's a little more than September and a little less than Feb probably. Although it's pretty bad. I'd say it's -- yeah. So you came home yesterday and found this. - Yep. - I mean this used to be a peaceful, lovely quiet -- - Yeah, it's sad for Sumner but that's nature, isn't it, unfortunately we've just been hit where other places haven't and that's just the freak of nature. My dad, the vicar, and three others were cleaning out the shed when it happened and Dad couldn't stop crying it was so frightening hearing the whole church just come down on itself. Yesterday, I have to say, was terrifying. February was very frightening but yesterday was terrifying and I am ashamed to say I lost it and swore and ran out onto the deck and said that f word right out loud at the whole world. - You've had enough. - I've had enough, yeah. You've had all this right through here? Yeah, that was up to here. - Right up, right round the back of the house, everywhere. - We came on Tuesday with my kids and I came round and did all this through here. - People this time are feeling different, aren't they? - I'm okay when I'm with people but otherwise no, pretty bad, a few tears, especially when you live on your own, it's not the best. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'll never buy another house anyhow, that's for sure. - I don't want to stay because I'm that petrified I can't even focus properly, for the last nine months, how can you? If I had the option to go I'd be gone. I don't think Christchurch is going to be anything anymore. I think it's had it, you know. The town, this side of it, I think it's, you've just got to put a line through the middle to me, that's how I feel. What plans are there at the moment? Well, there's so many things we don't know yet and we want to make the very best decisions we can make because we'll be building here a new cathedral which will respect our past, our heritage, and build for the future. This city and the province were in essence established by the Anglican church. And it's not about arrogance, it's about commitment. We are committed to this city and we want to continue to play the role that we played in the past but it will be ultimately the Anglican cathedral built on Anglican land paid for largely I'm sure, with Anglican money and we need to make good decisions. So we don't want to be too hasty about making decisions. It's too important this. You know, you get pushed by people who say you've got to get on and do things and overall we're saying, yeah, we know that, we do need to get on, but we need to make the right decisions and we need to have the right information for making those decisions. What's your favourite building in New Zealand? Well, I have to say this one. This is my baby. This is my favourite so I'm fighting with her, I'm turning off life support. Giving it a number saying where it comes from, day it comes down, the building it belongs to, what it is so it can go into this shed and get stored. The original idea was that we were going to lift the dome down in one piece but because of the aftershocks on the 13th it's caused more damage so we're now taking it down in pieces. Where were you on June 13th, Murray? When the quake struck, I on was on the edge of dome in the cage watching the dome move away 400 or 400 mls and then come back and wobble a bit like a jelly and then settle down back into its place again. So we just slewed away and looked out over the city and saw all the dust and that come from the city. It's a relief actually. - Is it? - Yeah, just because we've watched it degrading and crumbling for 4 ½ months. It's like sitting with someone who's dying, you sit and watch and wait. I mean it's heart breaking but to put this gracious old lady out of misery. The city that was here has gone. The streets are gone. The sewage systems are gone. There's an opportunity in this to recast it. I think there's an opportunity here to actually say nature is telling us something about Christchurch. Let's follow nature. Let's design with nature. - The city was actually built around the four estates. So the first estate was put in the middle, which was the Anglican church, who were the establishment in those days. The second estate was the university up the street. The third estate was the government, which was on the river. And the fourth estate was in behind the Cathedral. - The Press. - Yeah, the Press. And on the 22 February every one of those buildings either suffered complete damage or major damage. - There's a different set of moral values today to what there were then. - Absolutely. - That was about imposed values from the top down to the community. - That's right. - And what I fear is, and what seemed to be happening after the last earthquake, they were trying to just reproduce that. If there are 10,000 families dislocated bring 10,000 families into the four avenues. There are only solutions at the end of the day. The human race is incredible in its ability to recover and Christchurch will recover from this but it can recover in two ways. You can end up with a devastated boring commercial area with single storey tilt slab buildings everywhere and your shopping malls filling the void and create a suburban city, which nobody really wants to live in. Or you can become an amazing sort of beacon for how a new urban way of living can be created. The only way I can really explain this is for you to come and I'll show you. It was October 17th 1989 and at 5.04 p.m. we had a 6.9 earthquake that devastated not only our city but the entire bay area, over 60 lives were lost and it was a real shaker. Not as bad as Christchurch though, I must say when I saw the damage there and realised how big it was because it was right under the city and much closer to the surface it had a much bigger impact than ours did, which was some 40 miles away. This is our new baseball stadium. - Right down on the water front. This is all on reclaimed land. - This liquefied. That didn't put you off? You didn't talk about retreating from this area and building away? - Absolutely not. It's too important to us and what we're doing is refining and developing and strengthening our methodology for dealing with liquefaction and that involves driving piers down 100s of feet into the hard rock or bedrock as well as compacting the land and all the things that the experts tell us will help us deal with it. But you know, in the final analysis, no matter where you go in our country there's always going to be some kind of potential for natural calamity. We choose this because this is our home, this is where we want to live and we will deal with what comes and we get better with it every year because we're constantly working on not only our physical construction methods but our human methods of dealing with calamity. The Pearl District used to be an industrial warehousing area. It was very run down and in the past 10 years we've transformed it into this amazing urban living environment and it's right next to the central business district. - It seems to me the purpose of this place is to entertain the people who live here. - You're surrounded by housing for the community, for children. If you get the city right for children it's going to be right for everybody. Look at this intersection. There's no traffic lights. The traffic just stops, a pedestrian has priority. And look up the street here. We've got trams, we've got on street parking the cars are all going round about 10, 15 kilometres an hour and yet there's no regulations, there's no signage telling them to do it. And this part of Portland the pedestrian owns these streets. This is a green street. You've got residential buildings on either side and this provides them with outside space. So this is like the pedestrian connections through the blocks and then you've got the other major arteries that are taking the traffic and the trams. People after Katrina came down here by the thousands to help us rebuild the city and when they go here they discovered a New Orleans that they didn't know existed, a place that's really like an amazing spirit of incredible people and just a way of life that's different from the rest of America. A lot of them were kids who went back to college and graduated and have since moved here. They came, first probably with the sort of the spirit of benevolence, I'll tear out walls, I'll help people eat, I'll find a way to get people into homes and then they started saying, let's build businesses, let's start things, so it became a great catalyst for businesses and organisations doing wonderful things here. There's something about New Orleans and also, I'm from Christchurch, and there's something about Christchurch, that people will tell you too that, yeah, you can move to Auckland, you can move to Wellington, and you can move to the country or the beach, but it's not Christchurch, and that's what people feel about New Orleans too. You've got a lovely house here. - Yes, each and every home is individualised, personalised best to the people's needs and each and every home is special. It's organised by Brad Pitt and Angelina. - Have they been personally involved here? Have they come down here? - Yes, they're very much involved, all the time. You have to stay strong. It's not easy. It's been about six years and yes, we still cry. Yes, we miss a lot of things. I would love to pass great hope to the people of New Zealand and all the ones who have been through the devastation. It's very hard to come back home but one has to stay strong, you have to give all your will, you have to set a new future which is not really easy. If you keep the hope high and you know, help one another's neighbours and keep your prayers, that's going to help you. Everybody's going to go through a depression. You miss everything that you had. It's normal. It's part of the process. If you want to cry it's okay to cry and just let it but you have to look at the future and you know set a new future. And this is your future. This is my future right here, yes. Hello, how are you? I'm just putting focaccia through. This is the last of the bake before I go down to the market. You're up and running, eh? - Yeah, a friend of mine, he was living here he said, oh, look, we can set up a bake house so it's pretty good. It's pretty cramped quarters. I was doing roughly about a 7080 hour day and I was putting matchsticks under my eyeballs to stay awake on Sunday. But the girls look after me, they're really good. - So you really are up and running. - Yeah, well, like I say all of this is a matter of salvaging tools and then just applying them and trying to get back into the trade. - So you're all right? - Yep, yep, most definitely. People can either bring a book and swap it for another book or just come along and help themselves to books from the fridge. - Books from the fridge? Yes, because you can see what's inside it and the books are going to be safe. We can leave it here and it's going to be open 24/7. There are lot of people who want to do something to contribute to the city right now, to get involved, to feel connected to what's happening and there's a lot of vacant space and if you can just take away the barriers to it being utilised then people can make things happen there, they can experiment, they can encourage innovation and creativity, all these things which can really sort of contribute the regeneration of this city and that works hand in hand with the top down demolition that the property owners are going to be doing. - I'm hearing a lot these days, oh, just try it, whereas before the earthquake there was a lot of, oh do you think, maybe we should ask permission, whatever, so there's a real kind of productive anarchy going on. I certainly have done the why me, why it, how come, all that stuff, and then I come back to, it's random. It's absolutely random. And why did those gorgeous young people I travelled up and down in the lift with for all those years who were going to the language school and were practising their English as they went up and down the lift, you know why did that happen. And I come back to, there is no answer to that, it's random, utterly random. There is no reason. And I know people grapple to find reasons and there isn't. We live on this planet and this is the planet doing what it does and we're on it, and we were where we were on that day.
