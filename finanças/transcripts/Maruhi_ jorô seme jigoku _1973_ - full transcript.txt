A NIKKATSU production THE HELL-FATED COURTESAN The world is only suffering. My life is only misfortune Our existence is meaningless in this floating world Hardly more than a dewdrop Hardly more than a dewdrop Screenplay by Yozo Tanaka Cinematography by Kurataro Takamori Production Designer Gunji Kawasaki Music by Hiroshi Nabeshima Starring: Rie Nakagawa as Osen Yuri Yamashina as Ocho Akira Takahashi as Tomizo A film by Noboru Tanaka Try several houses. You'll get your money's worth... Get a move on! Make it snappy! Have a little patience! Come on. How much longer? Wait! Almost finished. Give it all you got! Go! 100 pennies for a whore is cheap. All the customers rush to this seedy area. It's a problem when you're broke. The good girls get picked up quick. But, if you're in a hurry, you gotta settle for one of the old ones. Look at this beauty! A true pearl in this shithole. See you later! Go ahead, if you're not afraid to die. - Why? - Look closer. It's Osen, the cursed one. - The cursed one? - She's the great geisha of Yoshiwara. She failed in this cesspool because of her bad luck. One customer died in her arms, another of a contagious disease. She's really scary! Three of her customers died after sleeping with her. Like they say, appearances can be misleading. Formerly a geisha of luxury, today a whore of the gutters. Such a beautiful girl - what a waste! If you want to die, go up to her. Good luck friend. I'm leaving! Don't leave me all alone! You're pissing my seed out into the stream? You could've at least let it grow a little in your stomach. Better not - my stomach's full of small evil seeds, and they'll eat yours all up. Hurry! - I'm here! - You're not finished yet? Osen, no customers again tonight? It's fine with me. Fine, go ahead and look bored. I can't take it any more! - What's wrong? - Why not? I need a girl! Will you screw me? I like you! You can screw me twice, if you want! Really? Bondage, kissing and a screw?! 100 pennies for that? What a scam! Hey! Watch your mouth! You threatening me? You got the balls to say that to another girl... Do you know who you're talking to? I am Kuma the carpenter. My little Kuma, it's love at first sight. What's your problem? - You're new here. - Well? - I'm buying you! - It's settled! 100 pennies! Even in this slum, you have many customers? Hurry it up. They call me the ladykiller of whores! Don't come crying to me afterwards! If I please you, do as you want with me. Undress yourself. It stays on! That's the rule. You think you're a geisha of luxury? I'll show you! What whiteness! Your flesh is appetizing! It's so soft, like velvet! You'll drive me insane. It feels like you're inhaling all of me with your hole... And it will never come back out. What was your name again? Osen. Osen! That's a very pretty name. I'm going to make you cry with pleasure. Osen? Is that your name? You are Osen the cursed one? That's my nickname, so it seems. Are you afraid? Yellowbelly! Let me go! I want to live! Ladykiller of whores? I'm the one that'll make you cry! What do you have to say now? Good god! This is amazing! I don't care if I die in this pleasure! I am in a hurry. That's good. Osen, you've been drinking too much sake. Save me your sanctimoniousness. The sake washes away the shame. Is that all you earned? It's my money. And half of it belongs to my owner. If he thinks I cheated him out of money, he'll beat me with a stick. Whatever happened to your promise? When will you get me out of here? You are in the worst brothel in the city. Don't worry; you can't go any lower. Bastard! You're not working either? Give me a drink. Omatsu, you repairing your tool? It's just a scratch. But it stings. An old fox like you got her tool scratched up? No wonder her tool is worn out! As you say! That's my cup. Forgive me. Come here. You bring me bad luck. Oyone, I thought we decided not to speak any more about that. Since you gave me a drink, I forgive you. Well said, Osen. You know how to swallow your pride. You are a great old geisha. Since the cursed one is here, I keep losing this game. It's God, punishing you with malice. Is that your cup? It's probably full of diseases. What's your problem? You look dirty, I was just cleaning you up. Bitch! You already took my husband! Your husband? You mean this wreck? When they pay, that makes him a customer. You seduced him with your old geisha techniques? I forbid you to make eyes at him. He's the one that wanted it, not me. Whose fault is it if he's ogling other women? Bitch! - What? - Bitch! Say that again! Oyone! Stop! You fight with conviction. Wanna bet? How much? Oyone, stop! That's enough! Are you crazy? I hope you rot in hell! Osen, go to bed. Tomorrow, we're going to see the artist. Again? He doesn't want to see anybody other than you. He seems to appreciate you. He even paid Tomizo in advance. Tomizo? Didn't Tomizo tell you? That good-for-nothing, I hate him. I'll pray in front of your prints. Osen, a goddess?! She'll just give bad luck to whoever buys them. It's not my fault I come from a better place than you. - What? - Calm down. Hyota, you are her husband. Do something. Oyone, calm down. Let go of me! So nice to breathe. They just changed this sewer. Osen, you are beautiful even without make-up. - Tomizo, hush up. - No, it's true. You kept the grace of being a geisha. It is because of you I am still here. What do you mean? Look at this tattoo. I was in love, I wanted to die with him. Because of my nickname, I had lost all my customers, and him as well. And you were the only one kind enough to attend me. I thought that you were a sincere man, with a pure heart. But now, I understand your true intentions. You were looking to exploit me. Not for long, believe me! Master, you're really taking your time today! Don't move. Think about me. I'm getting tired holding this pose. Just a little longer. - Such passion! - What should I do? I live for art. You're not tired of looking at open thighs? Each sex has its own characteristics, like a face. By looking at a face, I can guess the form of the sex. You're a wierdo! You've interested me from first sight. I was right, your sex is a pearl among sexes. I don't know what to say. I feel disturbed by all your compliments. Stay in that pose! Incredible! It looks like a new living species. Just this can get you wet? You're going to make me blush! If it wasn't so risky, I would fuck you! Osen, the damned! What an idiot this artist is! What do you want? Little thieves? Not at all. Play some music. - Play some music. - Please. I'm just as poor as you are, pariahs. Let me through. Give us a little something. Pick it up. - Thank you. - Leave me alone now. Pariahs! Brutes! Don't ruin it! Master! If you have to hate somebody, it should be your husband. This is what I paid him for. Look. No, don't touch me! Let go of me! That's enough! Tomizo, it's your turn. I want to see you do it. OK, show me. Here, this is for Osen. Tie her up. Tomizo! I needed money. I don't want to. Did you sell me? - You are a monster! - Shut up! We have to do it. Are you OK? Do you want to know? I'm not like everybody else. I'm Osen the damned. It takes more to hurt me. Untie me. Osen! Bastard! Go, asshole! You hurt my testicles! I'm in pain! It is over between us. The masterpiece. Look at it. Dog! Osen, I'm sorry! Loser! There has been an attempted double-suicide! Go and see at the square. The man is from Ryogoku, Narrator in the Tosa group. His name is Kumezo. The woman's name is Ocho. They flouted the law because of the crime of double suicide. But they failed in their attempt. Therefore, and in accordance with Article 100 of the law, they will be left for three days... in the Square of the Condemned, before being exiled to a village of pariahs. She has beautiful eyes. She must have a pure heart. - A double suicide! - Come and see this! A double suicide? - What happened? - It's a suicide. A suicide! Hey! You lost your comb. I never reuse a broken comb. You don't? - Thank you. - Listen... You are bleeding. Take this tissue. I don't need it. It's just a scratch. OK. Goodbye, thank you. Osen! What happened? I had a bad fall. What happened? Tomizo! I know you're there. Monster! Cur! Worm! I don't want to see you anymore. If you don't leave, I'm going to hit you. I'm not joking. I've had enough of you! Who are you?! What a warm welcome! Be patient, you'll get better. I didn't introduce myself. I'm Seikichi, I'm a puppeteer in the Tosa group. The puppets theater group? Yes. I'm just an apprentice, I'm not allowed to handle them yet. You don't seem like the kind of person to hang out in this neighborhood, but you can't judge a book by its cover. I followed you from the Square of the Condemned. You're a rascal. I'm sorry, but come back some other day. Don't be fooled. What do you mean? I'm in a terrible mood. Speak clearly. I want to hit everybody! So, here it is... You laughed earlier at the square. It's true. Are you not supposed to laugh in front of the condemned? I want to know why you laughed. Here... Well... Since I know the condemned, it disturbed me when you laughed. You know the condemned? I do. The condemned one named Ocho, she's my sister. Then... you said that she had beautiful eyes. I never saw such beautiful eyes. My sister is blind. Despite her blindness, she fell in love, like all girls of her age, with a narrator of her group, that I also belong to. His name was Umekichi. However, his beauty brought bad luck. She was engaged to Umekichi, but another man tried to seduce her. It was Kumezo, the co-condemned. Umekichi? You smell like alcohol. We promised to stay pure until our wedding day. Please... Umekichi, be patient. Umekichi dear, why are you so silent? Umekichi... Ocho! Who you are? But who are you? Ocho... I want eyes to see. I want to see the light. I'm in the dark. Umekichi... I wish I could see your face, just once before I die. But neither Ocho nor Kumezo are dead. Ocho then asked Kumezo to die with her. Shameful, she wanted to go to hell with him. It must have been hard for you, too. Yes. Kumezo will be exiled to a village of pariahs. But thanks to his rich parents, he will be able to buy a new identity. Me, I don't have the means to buy one for Ocho. My poor blind sister will have to live with pariahs. I was so sad for her. I thought of killing her myself. That was when I heard you laugh. You seemed to be making fun of my distress. So, I decided not to kill Ocho. If it will make you feel any better, lay down next to me. I'll make you forget your sadness for a little while. I'll be happy to comfort you. But... I don't have the intention... You don't? But it will get rid of your anger. You can overcome it? You need affection. I don't ask for anything. We were meant to meet each other in that square. You can hold me as hard as you can. Osen... forgive me! This is not an ordinary guy! Ocho! Your brother Seikichi was really worried about you. Who are you? My name is Osen. I'm a low-caste woman. - Are you talking about my brother? - Yes. You must be mistaken. I don't have a brother. So, do you know somebody named Umekichi? Yes, he was my fianc?. Is he a narrator in the Tosa group? No, he is a puppeteer. A man without a heart, who doesn't care about anything but his dolls. If he wanted to marry me, it is because I looked like one of his dolls. I didn't know. I'm sorry for bothering you. All of Edo already knows my history. Umekichi never touched me. I let this man caress me, knowing that he was not Umekichi. The bitch, she got me! I fell into her trap. A woman's heart... is unpredictable and terrifying. I knew you would come back. Instinct, I suppose. Tomorrow night, Ocho will be exiled to the pariah village. Indeed. After she leaves, I will go to Osaka. I will look for another group that will hire me as a puppeteer. - So we will not see each other anymore? - No. If you feel like it, I'm yours. It will be like a goodbye present. That is not why I came. Then why? If you don't lay down, it means that you have a problem. Or do you feel bad, because of Ocho? Eh, Umekichi? Get out of here! I'm losing clients because of you. Osen! What? I don't want to replace Ocho. Please, be my doll. Give me your entire body! It's hot. Are women's breasts supposed to be this heavy? Osen... Don't move. Stay still, like a doll. She wiped her tears... and got up suddenly, with a determined look on her face. "Jealousy is eating me alive. "I'm overwhelmed by a feeling of rage. "How do I get rid of this anger? "I owe this anger to the one who stole my husband "Even if I disappeared... "to the bottom of the sea, "I would still have enough... voice to scream and share my wrath... "with the surface." And then she leaned over the river. Its quiet movement showed her face like a mirror. She saw that she had the appearance... of a giant snake... Thanks to you, I became a man. You are good. Why did you lie when you said that you were Seikichi, Ocho's brother? It was because you laughed in the Square of the Condemned. It was like you were making fun of me. Your laugh made me realize how weak I was. At the time, I felt ashamed. And that shame was even stronger... because I was in the square, in front of Ocho. You have a big mouth! - Not at all, Osen. - That's enough! You can stop your sweet talk. It's 100 a trick. There is nothing else between us. Osen! Come in! Here, Kuma! You came early today. Don't make me wait! What are you doing with this fop? Good timing, I'm hot. Damn! You got me crazy. I can't stop thinking about you. I accept to be damned! Hey, you! Don't forget to pay what you owe me. Your husband is back. Did you forget me? Shut up! Don't bother me when I'm working! You call that work? If you want, I will be your client. If I pay, you cannot say no. I refuse. What? Idiot! You are just merchandise! I know. But whores are still women. I have the right to refuse a rat like you! Piece of trash! Calm down! Tomizo, stop it! Stop this. You are going to attract the police. Osen, if he pays 100, you have to accept. Boss... Do your job. Sorry for bothering you. Accept my apologies. What are you talking about? - Hit me! - No need... touching a monster would only sully me! Five gold coins... I invested the money that the painter gave me. Your coins smell like vermin. You don't want to forgive me, even if I beg you? I have nothing to forgive you for, because I don't know you anymore. I'm in pain! - Help me! - You won't get me! My testicles are hurt... Your kick... I'm really hurt. Is it true? You cheated me! Don't worry, you will get a reward. But I'm soiled forever. Let go of me! You bastard! You're nothing but a scumbag! Stop it! Dead beat! Let go of me! Asshole! I'm going to purify you. Stop it, pervert! I love you, I really do. I understood with the painter. I will give you your purity back. It's disgusting! You're nothing but vicious. No... Stop it. Osen... What a show! Want to try it? No, I would rather do the usual! - Hachi! - Oyoshi! - I will be back. - Don't cheat. - Thank you for the show. - What show? You know what I'm talking about. You know how to turn men on. I'm jealous. Did you watch us? I should have been more careful. Ocho! There is nothing I can do for you. I know, I betrayed you. What did you want to do for me? I wanted at least... that you not be exiled with the pariahs. Me, no matter where I am, I'm in the dark. Sorry, Ocho. What are you sorry about? I'm sorry for you, but I'm happy for the first time in my life. Ocho... I united my destiny to Kumezo's, with whom I rubbed elbows with death. I don't want to go to hell with this woman! His warm blood and my frozen blood mixed on the cold floor. Umekichi, right at that moment, I forgot about you. Kumezo and I, we are together for eternity. No! Help! He is the man of my life. From now on, I'm his, body and soul. We are united forever. Ocho! I have somebody now, too. One, two, three, four... You got up early. Osen! You look awful. I'm going to Osaka tomorrow. You already told me yesterday. There is something else I need to tell you. What is it? Accompany me to Osaka. Osen! Don't make fun of me. I'm in love with you! All my clients say that. You are the first for me. Before I met you, I couldn't tell the difference between men and women. I knew the faces of dolls, not humans. In the warmth of your body, I became a human with warm blood. But you are with Ocho. I just talked to her. I told her about you. And? Ocho smiled when she heard. She said that she had already forgotten about me. She is with Kumezo now. Really? I'm very surprised. Osen... come with me. A whore is a prisoner of her debts. These are five gold coins that I had kept for Ocho. Take them. It won't be enough to reimburse my boss. I know I'm asking for the impossible. Once in Osaka, I don't know when I'll be back. I don't want to be away from you. Give your boss these coins, and we'll send him the rest from Osaka. OK, Osen? You are cruel with me. Painting a life in glowing colors, a normal life, away from this place... Exactly. Leave this place. I have that horrible Tomizo. When you are far from Edo, he won't be able to do anything. - It's a dream. - No, it's real. Tomorrow, we'll be on our way. I don't know what to do. Don't hesitate. Trust me. What do you want me to do? I will be waiting for you tomorrow at dawn, in the Square of the Condemned. At dawn in the square. Umekichi... I'll be waiting for you. It's a one time opportunity. Go with him. Really? Look at me, it's over. Make a decision. She's right, it's over. - What? - Forget about it. Leave the money. We will find an arrangement with the boss. Don't hesitate, it'll be worth it. Don't hesitate, it'll be worth it. Osen! Osen! I'm in pain... You're completely drunk. - I have a stomach ache. - Don't lie to me. Listen, I'm in pain. Don't go in. I'm waiting for clients. Too bad. You'll get out when the client arrives. Osen! What? So? What a wreck! Get up. But... He is dead. He is dead! Help! There is a dead man! That bum is dead. He's dead. Osen, hang in there. It's not the right time to cry. Go get the boss. Water He's cold! What a chicken! You do it then! - Drink a little. - Thank you. We won't see this one again. Good riddance! Don't be mad at me in the other world. I told you not to cheat. I'll take a finger from you... so you won't cheat in the other world. Osen! Osen, are you crazy? Leave her alone. Boss, take the dead man. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. Gee, he's heavy! Boss, are we good? Let's go. Osen, you must be feeling better. But if you leave, all of us will be sad. Stay positive. With that, I'm going to prepare his wake. Leave me alone. Come on! It's cold! I'm tired. Sake makes me dizzy. Me, I'm cross-eyed. You know, Hyota, the weak ones like Tomizo all end up like this. That's what I thought. Do you understand? So, you won't miss Oyone? Tonight, the police will come. I'm going to warn her! You idiot! That's why you fail! - But, boss... - Listen... the girls are sold in Yoshiwara. And you, you'll get a commission for the sale? You learn fast. Once they pay back their debts, they'll come back. It's a ruthless world. With mercy, we wouldn't be able to do this job. - Now, let's go have fun. - Yes, to forget about death. Osen... Tomizo, now, you'll go to Heaven. Are you happy that you won't be going to Hell? Listen to me carefully. You were a pervert, a thief, a cheater and a liar! Thank God you left this Earth, scumbag! Osen... I have a stomach ache. Are you a ghost? Please, be at peace. I have a stomach ache. Give me my finger back! Osen! Osen, what's going on? Osen, I'm cold. Warm me up. - Who told you to come in? - What's going on? You are interrupting. Is it a ghost? I'm scared! What's going on? Osen, I have a stomach ache. I'm here. I'm cold. Warm me up. The doctor will be here in a minute. Osen, run. Tonight, the police will come. I overheard the boss. Is it true? Asshole, he sold us! I'm leaving tonight! Don't stay here! Let's go, Osen. Police Shit! The police are already here. The boss betrayed us. Osen, run! You need to go far from here. Go with Umekichi. No, I'll stay with Tomizo. Go away. Don't worry about me. It's too late anyway. - But... - You irritate me! I'll stay - you convinced me with your sweet talk! To tell you the truth, I have prepared a hiding place to run away to. Now, come with me. Come in. You are cold. How can I warm you up? They'll hear us. Asshole, let go of me! You are hot. Don't move. Your wound will open up. Osen, get on top of me. But, honey... I want you. But you're going to die... I don't care. Tomizo... My body is still here. Life is bizarre. But you are really strong. It's incredible. God is my witness... I die coming! Where are you going? I can go take a piss, can't I? Osen, are you there? But if you become free, your destiny will catch up with you. If you miss your chance with Umekichi, you'll regret it forever. Do you understand? Omatsu... Come on, run. Are you done peeing? I don't pee as fast since I started this job. Follow the others. I feel better. Walk in silence. Umekichi! Umekichi... I'm waiting for you in Osaka, Umekichi You're so stupid! I'm Osen the damned... men who love me die! Listen to me... Let's leave it at this... because... I want to spare you the curse. Do you understand?
