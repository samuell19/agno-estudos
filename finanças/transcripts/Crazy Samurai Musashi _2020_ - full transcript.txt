Aren't you scared? That's cute. Not the butterfly Now, listen. Once the duel begins, you'll have to confront him as the head of the clan. But you won't need to fight. We won't let him touch you, Matashichiro. He already killed two of your leaders, and now that boy is your new head? I think your days are numbered. You mercenary! Watch your mouth, you money-grubber! There is no time to argue. Today, Miyamoto Musashi will die. We'll avenge Seijuro and Denshiro. And we will kill the bastard to restore our reputation. He's late. Did he get cold feet? I doubt it. Maybe he's planning a sneak attack. He did the same to Seijuro. You've seen Musashi's face before, right? Yes. I would never forget. He looked How did he look? He looked Ah, I gotta take a dump. Isn't it about time? Be patient. The man is full of dirty tricks. That's why we strategized this duel in advance. I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!! A monster! A monster is coming! We've gathered 100 of our students and 300 mercenaries. Sensei! Seijuro was like a brother to me. I, Chusuke, promise to avenge him. Even the notorious Musashi will not survive this army of men. Sir. If I may, an army for a single opponent is not a good look for honorable samurais like us. This is far from being a duel. What if What if those mercenaries end up killing Musashi? We'll be a laughingstock. In that case, we'll get a big bonus. In that case, we'll kill them too. You two, go check the area. - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! I want Chusuke to take over the clan. That old dirty bastard is driving our clan to destruction. Watch your mouth! But Right now, focus on defeating Musashi. Don't you get it? I have taken a shine to you. I have great hope for you. I don't want you to receive even a scratch from this fight. I want to avenge Seijuro, protect Matashichiro, and defeat our opponent. so I can be the new head of the Yoshioka clan with honor. I know you have a strong will. It's time to go. Let's talk it over somewhere private. Looks like the clan is over. Matashichiro! Musashi! How did he get here? Musashi! He's right there! Kill him! Don't let him get away! Kill him at all costs! Corner him! Kill him! Musashi, prepare to die! Kill the bastard! - Get ready! - Take him down! Let's get this started. Come and get it! Surround him! Kill him! Go! Go! I'm one of the grandmasters of the clan, Nanpo Yoichibei. Musashi, your head is mine! Take this! How many more? Long time, Musashi! Time to settle the score. Shishido Baiken You aren't from the Yoshioka clan! Who cares? As long as I get to kill you, scum! Musashi!! - Charge! - Go! Get him! Surround him! I'll kill them all. - He's there! - Over there! This way! I see him there! - Over there! - I found him! Kill him! Where the hell is Musashi? Damn. Find him. He's hiding. Where did he run to? Come out, Musashi! Find him! Find him! - Musashi! - Find that bastard! You're looking pale, coward. Chickened out? We can't defeat him. Let's end this nonsense. What did you say? Nonsense, you said? Look over there! Are you really a samurai of the clan? Killing Musashi won't accomplish anything. Don't you wanna avenge Seijuro? How many people do you think have died for that? What the?! This madness? How dare you! Seijuro taught me everything I know about the sword. I've been told that I have a gift. That's why I'm your superior. So? So what? You! What were you thinking just now? Thinking about your wife? I knew it! You're a horny coward. No surprise. Your wife is damn hot. She has fair and smooth skin You don't wanna let her go, eh? Haven's you banged her enough? What a pig. Shut your mouth. No worries. I'll take good care of your pretty wife so you can die at ease. I said shut your mouth! What's this? You wanna do this? That'll be fun. I'll show you what I learned from the great Seijuro. I'm also a samurai of the clan. Keep barking. I never liked you anyway. Perfect timing. No one will know if I kill you here. You ready? Here I come! Musashi! Don't kill me. Go. Musashi! I'll fight you in the name of the clan! I am Ueda Ryohei. Here I come! Sensei! Sensei! Damn it! Run! Hurry! Samurai! He's over here! There he is! This way! This way! How many men do they have? I thought it would be around 70. I feel like I killed more than that. It's getting tough. Let's do this. I'll die one day, anyway. I am Miyamoto Musashi. Here I come! Musashi! You still want to kill us? One of the grandmasters Todo Kenji. I won't let you destroy the clan. Come. Not enough! It's cold You, die! Miyamoto Musashi! Kid who knows nothing of war, what do you want? How dare you! Draw! Draw your sword! Why did the Yoshioka clan have to be massacred that day? Where does your duty lie? Your honor? Duty? Honor? Who gives a crap? I just wanna win. Don't retreat! Aren't you a samurai? I am a samurai. So I will kill you! Come and get it. Charge! What are you? I am
