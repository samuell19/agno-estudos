[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [HUFFING] ALISON: Today'’s my birthday. I'’m not usually a big birthday person, but this one feels different. Something big s gonna happen. I don'’t know how I know this, but I do. Erbe! Well, if it isn'’t the birthday girl. Yeah. Where'’s my diamond bracelet? Hey, must have gotten lost in the mail. Here. What? No card? Get out of here, you'’re blocking my line. Well, no jewelery or insight from Erbe, but if I can get through my first meeting with George Trumbell, the best-selling author who eats editors like me for lunch, then anything is possible. Happy birthday.Thank you. New suit?Yeah, you like? Everything but the shoes. Oh, package from your mom.I can see that. China? Is she with the Rabbi? Yes.Oh, God, I love your mother. I can'’t get mine to leave New Jersey. Aren'’t you going to open it? Knock yourself out. You ready for Trumbell? Are you? You know, he'’s gone through eight editors in four years. Hope you haven'’t gotten too attached to a paycheck. Oh, thanks for your vote of confidence. Listen, we have to be done by 2:00. I got a meeting with Dupre out on Long Island. No problem. I have to go water my mother'’s plants. I can drop you on the way. Only if you promise to bring the car to a complete stop before I get out. Forget it. "Dear Alison, this is a birthday Buddha. Rub his belly for good luck. Sorry I couldn'’t be there. Love, Mom." Oh, that is so sweet. Very. Just stick it with the other "Sorry I couldn'’t be there" gifts. You ever wonder if there'’s something going on between your mother and the Rabbi? What? No. Gross. You'’ve never met him. He... he could be handsome and charming. My mother is not having sex with the Rabbi. [INTERCOM BEEPS]WOMAN: George Trumbell is here. Hah. Uh... Okay, put him in the Conference Room. We'’ll be right there. [EXHALING] Ready? For degradation, humiliation, and annihilation? It won'’t be so bad. [TRUMBELL CLEARS THROAT] For the record, I despise you people. What makes you think you qualify to review my work? The B-plus on your eighth grade Edith Wharton paper, or is it your undistinguished career at some minor college in the Midwest? TRUMBELL: You lead a life without risk or imagination, you will, no doubt, marry, procreate, and talk incessantly about your days in publishing, we can only hope they will be few. So... [CLEARS THROAT] Page one. Yeah, the seduction scene, it'’s... it's all over the place. Obviously you'’ve never been seduced. ALISON: So, now, if we change the seduction and cut the dream--[TRUMBELL] Dream stays. It'’s all story. Genius, but all story. I'’ll never cut the dream. It'’s all story for this book, but it would be brilliant at the beginning of a sequel. ALISON: It'’d redefine the genre... [INDISTINCT TALK] I'’m leaving. I've already spent way too much time here. In chapter 12, you'’ve Rupert jump-starting the engine with his eyeglass frames. Wouldn'’t he need to strip the wires with his teeth first? No.You can stick anything in the ignition, are you sure? I have sold 100 million books worldwide. I'’m sure. You kicked butt. [TIRES SCREECHING] [SCREAMING] Just tell me one thing, did we hit the kindergarten class on 91st? Would you relax? Would you slow down?All right, all right. Just keep it under 80. [TIRES SCREECHING, HONKING] Okay. So... what are you and Peter gonna do for your birthday? A dinner at our favorite Indian place. [TIRES SCREECHING]Move, you idiot! God! I think he'’s gonna propose. [BLOWS RASPBERRY]What is that supposed to mean? You know what it means. All Peter ever thinks about is Peter and his book. You don'’t like him, do you? The man barely acknowledges that you'’re dating. Look, I have nothing against Peter, I just think he'’s not for you. Left up here.I know. Left.I know. [HORN TOOTING] [MAN SCREAMING] Well, he said he had something very important that he wanted to ask me, something that would change our future. That doesn'’t mean marriage. He used the word, "our." He'’s talking in the plural. Oh, that'’s wonderful, Alison. I'’m, uh, very happy for you. I know what a struggle he'’s had with pronouns. [BOTH SCREAM] Mom, what are you doing here?I live here! But you'’re supposed to be in China. I came home early. You scared me. You scared me! I thought the house was broken into.Bite your tongue. What are you doing here? Did you get my Buddha? I came to check on the plants. Yes, he'’s wonderful. What are you doing here in the middle of the day? You didn'’t get fired, did you? No, I didn'’t get fired. Why do you always expect the worst? Because then I'’m never disappointed. Oh, no, look what happened to my little baby. It'’s gone. How'’s Peter? He'’s fine. Did it ever occur to you that I'’m really good at my job? Of course you are, but that doesn'’t guarantee job security. Look what happened to Alan Heisenberg. He got hit by a truck. On his way to a matinee, which he wouldn'’t have been going to if he hadn'’t been downsized. Well, I haven'’t been fired. In fact, I just had a big meeting with George Trumbell. Oh! Who'’s he? Look But Don'’t Touch, Better Dead Than Sorry, Spies, Blood and Water... Oh, yes, yes, yes, he writes those spy novels. I can'’t read them. They confuse me.Oh. Oh, but darling, I know he'’s a big deal in your business. Congratulations. I'’m editing his next one, Death Succumbs Her. I... I kicked butt. Darling, don'’t talk like that. Is that what you wore at the meeting? Yeah. Your hair looks nice. How'’s Grandma? Grandma is fabulous! Grandma!Surprise. Hi, darling. GLORIA: I was just about to call you. Hello, dear. Mother, what are you doing here? Oh, I'’m breaking in a new pair of hiking boots. How was your trip? Fine. Did you get to see everything you wanted? I always do. Is that what you wore on the plane? Well, I gotta, uh, get back to the office. Wait a minute, not so fast. I have a surprise. ALISON: What? Happy birthday, sweetheart. What is it? It'’s three days and two nights at the Royal Bahamas, for you and your mother. What?What? No. Remember the time I took you on a trip for your birthday? Well I thought we could continue the tradition. No. I mean, I mean, uh... Alison couldn'’t possibly take time off her job now-- ALISON: Mom is exhausted after her trip. Right?Totally. I'’m wiped out.Oh, nonsense. Eric can cover for you. And as for you, well, the nice thing about China is after two hours, you'’re ready to travel again. Mom...Oh, no, it'’ll be fun. You two have never gone away together. Mother, I said no! Well... I mean, yes, I guess, uh... we'’re gonna be spending some time in the Bahamas. Fun.Fun. Fun. [HORN TOOTING] [TRADITIONAL CHINESE MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, sweetheart, please don'’t be like this. It doesn'’t matter that we couldn'’t get into Saheev's without a reservation. I love our Chinese place. Since when do they only take reservations? They'’ve always been that way. I... I just always made them. I should have told you. Well. ALISON: Oh... How sweet. When did you tell them it was my birthday? I didn'’t. Happy birthday, Miss Alison. Thank you, Gom Chi. It'’s very thoughtful. Isn'’t that thoughtful? Uh, I guess we should do that, um, present thing. Oh. I didn'’t have time to wrap it. That'’s all right. Saves paper. A vase? How sweet. I saw it and it reminded me of you. Really? What part? What? What part of the vase reminded you of me? Well, it... it was so contained, uh, no, it was so simple. Look, I don'’t know. I just thought... I saw it, I thought you'’d like it. I do, I do. Thank you. I love it. Oh, good. [CHUCKLES] I love you. So, uh... Shall we, uh, blow this joint? Wasn'’t there something else? Was there? You said there was something you wanted to ask me, something that would change our future. Oh! No, I was gonna ask you later. Oh. Don'’t wanna rush you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Um, I... I can ask here. [EXHALES AND CLEARS THROAT] Uh, Alison... We... we'’ve been together for a couple of years now, and, um, yes, we'’ve had our ups and downs, but, um... I... I'’ve really come to trust you. [EXHALES DEEPLY] It'’s okay, sweetheart. Close your eyes. [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Okay. [EXHALES DEEPLY] Alison, will you-- Yes!read my book? That... that'’s what you wanted to ask me? What did you think I was going to ask? Uh... I thought you were gonna propose. M--Marriage?Yes! Are you out of your mind? Why, because I wanna marry the man I love, and start our life together? Well, that makes absolutely no sense. Alison, I...I... I haven'’t established myself yet. I mean, I can'’t even afford a... I can'’t even afford a cellphone. But I know you'’re gonna be successful. I know that. That'’s not the point. Uh... [STAMMERS AND MUMBLES] Oh, Peter, Peter... This is your check. [SIRENS WAILING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: Achmed! Achmed! Doctor Dupre'’s love pattern,number nine, "You are attracted to people whose behavior is familiar." Meaning? Well, your mother used to disappear a lot, so you find men like Peter, who are here one minute, then gone the next. ALISON: My mother would never "disappear." She would leave unexpectedly, but that'’s 'cause she'’d always fly standby. It doesn'’t matter.Oh, what about David? David lives in Chicago. He'’d visit, and then he'’d go home. Here, not here.All right. Mark? Mark keeps slipping in another coma. He wasn'’t in a coma, he was just quiet. Ah. Here, not here. [ELEVATOR DINGS] Where are you going? I told you. To the Royal Bahamas with my mother. Yeah. Yeah. And Lucy'’s gonna get Charlie Brown the football. ALISON: Bye. [SOFT GUITAR PLAYING] Hi. That'’d do it? My daughter'’s editing his next book. WOMAN: We'’re a little bit late. Come on. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Oh, no. No, Marty, you can'’t do this to me. It'’s urgent. I am not going. I promised her I would take her on this trip. And you will, in three days time. In the meantime, we need you in Dinora. ANNOUNCER SPEAKING: WOMAN: Only $770, sir. I'’m sorry. I'’m trying again. ANNOUNCER: Attention, all passengers... [HONKING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [DOOR OPENS] What happened this time? Uncle Leo. You uncle Leo, he was deep-sea fishing and had a terrible accident. And your mother had to go over immediately. Off to where? Dinora. The Azores? I don'’t believe this. Look, honey, forget her. You and I will go together. Look. I'’m all packed. Just take me back to the city. Are you sure? How could you do this to me? Your mother really wanted to go with you-- Just take me back to the city. [BIRDS CHIRPING] This is not the city. Do me a favor, Grandma. Next time you get me a birthday present, can you make it a small appliance? Alison... No, I really believed her this time. I feel so stupid! Alison, don'’t do this to yourself. I have something for you. Grandma, stop. You are not gonna smooth things over for her again. I do not want you telling me how wonderful I am, and I don'’t want any more presents. What is it? Uruz. It means "strength." Here. It'’s the rune of termination and new beginnings. It means that the life you'’ve been leading has outgrown its form. It'’s been handed down in our family for generations. Turn around. Grandma, what are you talking about? Well, I think it'’s time. For what? Time for you and the rest of the world to know how truly remarkable you are. Would you cut it out? This is not to be taken lightly. I wouldn'’t have given it to you if I hadn'’t thought you were ready. Ready for what? I think that'’s something your mother should tell you. Anyway, a little intrigue is good for the complexion, huh? [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Thank you. Mom. [TURNTABLE SCRATCHES] Mom. Alison? Surprise. What are you doing here? Thought maybe I could help. Help Uncle Leo.Who? [STAMMERING] Who... who knows. The doctors said he'’s dying, actually. Which is why I'’m here. Hi, I'’m the Rabbi. Yes, this is the Rabbi. Hello, Rabbi. So, he'’s okay? GLORIA: No, yes. You'’re the Rabbi? Uh, yes. I'’m glad to see you finally got those braces out. Rabbi, why don'’t you go and get the car, bring it around? I'’ll be right out. Okay? Will do. Excuse me. Um... Sun. It'’s not good to stand directly under the sun rays. You know it'’s not good for your skin. Why don'’t we go here and find a lil'’ shade? ALISON: I don'’t remember an Uncle Leo. GLORIA: Oh, he was on your father'’s side. Um, does your grandmother know you'’re here? She drove me to the airport.Oh, how helpful. Dad had three sisters. Yeah, yeah. He was married to one of them. It was a first marriage. It was annulled. I mean, does it really matter? Yes, it really matters. Can you tell me why going to tend to a sick uncle who was in the family thirty years ago, for ten minutes is more important than taking a trip with your daughter, for the first time ever? Mom, come on. What'’s going on here? Are you... are you and the Rabbi dating? What? What a relief. Oh! It'’s finally out in the open. The Rabbi and I are dating. You are? I see. Okay then. GLORIA: The Rabbi and I have to pick up some art before the store closes, but we can discuss this over dinner. Okay, honey, I... I am so sorry that you had to find out this way. Are you all right? I'’m fine. I'm all right. I'’m just shocked. But not really. I mean... I suspected, but the reality is... Oh! Sweetheart. ...so surreal. I told Ali the truth. You did?Yes, I... I told her about us dating. RABBI: Sweetheart, uh, I'’ve got the car out front. We'’re gonna be late. Gimme just a minute.Just... You know, honey, why don'’t you just... change into a... into a suit or something, you know? Relax by the pool. You could use a little color-- Where did you get this? Grandma gave it to me. She said you'’d tell me about--It wasn'’t hers to give. Give it back to me. But--Please give it to me now. Okay. This is not some silly little piece of jewelry. It wasn'’t hers to give, and she knows that. Now I'’ve got to go right now, but I'’ll be back and we'’ll... uh, don'’t forget dinner. [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] GLORIA: I am absolutely gonna kill Mother. Really, I don'’t know what'’s gotten into her. She'’s never done anything like this before. Was Arturo okay? Was he suspicious? He was very suspicious. I had to tell him Alison was your daughter. What?And that the two of you were going on vacation after our business was concluded. You what?I had to. Ugh! I will never use Alison. Do you understand me? Never! Listen to me. I will call everything off before I involve my daughter. Are we clear? Very.Good. [SITAR MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] This is highly irregular. I should not even be talking to you. We know. We'’re so sorry for the misunderstanding this afternoon. Okay. This whole transaction has been fraught with delays. Our previous buyer met with a very sudden... death. Oh. How unfortunate. The sudden appearance of your daughter was very disturbing. You are going on a vacation? Where?The Bahamas. We'’re very excited. When can we see the statue? Soon. So, as per your instruction, a half a million down. Problem? No. We'’ll leave after dark. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Oh. Hi, Peter. It'’s me. Uh, listen. It'’s a long story but I'’m in Dinora, the Casa de la Mare. I'’m sorry about the fight. When you get in or, um, back or whatever, just give me a call and let me know you'’re okay. Okay? I love you. Bye. Oh. It'’s Alison. Just kidding. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] There'’s a slight change in plans. You stay. She goes.What? We were under the impression that we would both be allowed to verify the product. Right. Sorry. Are we on or not? If you go alone, you might not make it back in time to meet our friends. Oh, I'’m sure they'’d understand. As a matter of fact, I'’m sure they'd insist. Gloria.Let'’s go. Gloria...If I'’m not back in two hours, you get Alison out of here and make her arrangement. Let'’s go. [SERENE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] MAN 1: Okay, I got the Davidsons at eight o'’clock. What else you got? MAN 2: I have the Cowens coming in 8:30 for you. It'’s their 50th birthday party and there'’s ten people. Good. Any messages for me? Um... I don'’t know. Who are you? [SNORTS] Alison Shaeffer. Daughter of Gloria Shaeffer, who is now dating the Rabbi. No. I'’m sorry. Are you expecting a call? [SCOFFS] Just from the good for nothing love of my life, who, at this moment, in our relationship I should be calling my fiance, but I'’m not holding my breath. Man trouble, huh? Well, we can'’t have that, can we, Alonzo? You know, there'’s a special event going on in the hotel tonight. It'’s the perfect remedy. It really will be a lot of fun. Dinora is the place where all your troubles disappear. Everybody calls me Sid. Come on, it'’ll be fun! Come on. [PEOPLE CHEERING] I don'’t limbo. Oh, of course you can. You ever try to? Uh, not since Stacy Holder'’s birthday party. Well, now you can dance without worrying what the boys will think. ALISON: Nice try. SID: Oh, come on. You'’ll be surprised at what you can do. Especially after one of these. [CHUCKLES] Mm. Yummy. Look at this guy. He'’s worth over two million dollars. Who, this guy?Yeah. Started the world'’s first Internet dating service. Wow. Woo. She'’s good. SID :Yeah. Rocket scientist at NASA. ALISON: No way! SID: Oh, yeah. Dinora. The place where appearances can sometimes be deceiving. I thought it was Dinora, the place where all troubles would disappear. Yeah. Well, we'’re a multi-model country. Come on!Your turn. [LAUGHING] Outstanding. You'’re a ringer. I think you broke the hotel record. Nah. I missed by a quarter inch! You rocked! Maybe I'’m not what I appear to be either. Hmm. No one ever is. [LAUGHS] ALISON: So, who are you? SID: I told you. I'’m Sid Simmons. ALISON: No. Who are you when you'’re not being who you appear to be? Oh, I'’ll tell you what. I'’ll tell you if you can say that again. That.[LAUGHS] That'’s funny. Thank you, Sid Simmons, for making me have a good time tonight. Well the pleasure is all mine, Alison Shaeffer, daughter of Gloria Shaeffer. You know her? Oh. Probably not. One I know, works for a chemical company. Ah. Definitely not. Mine thinks Formula 409 is a retirement plan. [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] Here. Let me. Key? Thank you. Here you go. Well, I g... I guess I just can'’t hold my Grappuccinos like I used to. [SID LAUGHS] Here, let me help you. Come on. Oh! whoa, whoa! Up, up, up. Here we are. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Well, well, well. I thought women only lied about their age. [CHUCKLES] [MOTORBOAT CHUGGING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN: Throw me the line. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [GUNSHOT] MAN: Senor Vasquez does not like mistakes. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [GASPS] Alison. We need to talk. [MUFFLED SPEAKING] What are you doing here? You scared me to death. And I really don'’t think you should be in my room, on so many levels. Your mother has been kidnapped. Huh? Ah! Sorry, I... Alison, listen to me, all right? Focus. I have to tell you something. Your mother is an agent with the CIA. My mother can'’t program her VCR. Look, your mother and I were sent down here on an emergency assignment. But somehow our cover got blown and now they'’ve kidnapped her. Look, no offense or anything, Rabbi, but I think you'’ve had a little bit too much of the old Concord grape. Alison, this is very, very serious. Listen, there'’s no way you'’re ever gonna convince me my mother is a... a spy with the CIA. I see you'’re trying to merge out of the expressway. My mother is a widow from Long Island who loves to travel. Period. Are you wet? Think of all the major events in your life, and why your mother wasn'’t there. Uh, college graduation. Aunt Lily had her hip replaced. I think. The student uprising in Tiananmen Square. My twenty first birthday. Uncle Jerry'’s aneurysm. The Berlin Wall came down. What about California last year? There was nothing going on there. It was Chelsea'’s first mixer. She tried to get out of there but Hillary insisted. I was paired up with your mother ten years ago after your father passed away. They were quite a team. My father was an agent too? Legendary. My fa... They said they met through an agency. I always thought they meant a dating agency. So, now... you both work for the CIA and are also dating? No. She just told you that and gave me that kiss so you wouldn'’t get suspicious. That'’s very considerate. Where is she? I told you. She has been kidnapped. I see. And does this happen often?Never. Ever?Never. Were you with anyone else last night? I... Did you talk to anyone? I talked to a lot of people. I won the limbo contest. Was anyone in your room? Sid walked me to my room.Who'’s Sid? Just some nice old guy. He knows Gloria Shaeffer, but it'’s not the same one. His works for some chemical company. That'’s it.What'’s it? That'’s how they found out who Gloria is. Through me? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What? Ah!Forget it. Forget it. All right? Look, I need you to stay put for now. I can'’t get you off the island just yet. Are you listening to me? Look, I'’m hungover and in shock, but I'’m not deaf. Do not talk to anyone.Shh! Do not talk to anyone. Do not go anywhere. Do you understand? But--No buts. This is a very precarious situation we'’re in here. Gloria and I were sent down here alone, with no backup, so for the time being, I'’m flying solo. Well, then I'’m going with you. Out of the question. It'’s way too dangerous. More dangerous than me sitting here alone and unprotected, not knowing who'’s who and what'’s what? Yeah. Way more. Well, you need me out there. If for nothing else, I'’m an extra pair of hands, an extra pair of eyes, an extra pair of-- Yeah. I get the idea, all right? Maybe. There'’s a man in my room with no shirt on. Well. Until reinforcements, at least to keep an eye on you. No. What am I talking about? Your mother would kill me. No. Forget it. Oh, come on. Come on! If the situation was reversed, and you were in my shoes, and the shoes were on the other foot, I'’d let you help me. What did you just do there? Changed the focus from content to context. Winning through confusion. Worked, didn'’t it? RABBI: Gloria'’s on an island that'’s half mile off shore, owned by a guy named Gustavo Vasquez. Now--Who'’s that? I'’ll tell you later, all right? Now, I'’ve located a boat that can get us out there. And if push comes to shove, you may have to cover me. Okay. Wait. What do you mean by "cover"? In case someone starts shooting. A gun? No. The breeze. Of course, a gun! Well, I see you'’re one of those reformed sarcastic Rabbis. Doesn'’t your wife mind you traipsing all over the world with my mother? I'’m not married. All Rabbis are married. Well, not the ones who also work for the CIA. It'’s in the Torah. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] Good morning, Mrs. Shaeffer. Sorry to have kept you waiting. I hope you'’ve been made very comfortable.Oh, very. Yes, this is... this is quite a place you have here. Um... dare I ask who did the decorating? Me. I did it all myself. I had a feeling. I found that I had quite a knack. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh. As we discussed, the Bank De Germaine will wire the balance just as soon as the product has been verified. Their letter. Slight problem. Oh?Yes. I'’m afraid I don't do business with the CIA. I don'’t blame you. I hear they take forever to pay. You may stop this little charade. I know exactly who you are, Gloria Shaeffer. And I know exactly who you are, Senor Vasquez. You'’re a businessman, who'’s gonna sell to the highest bidder. I can assure you that'’s me. Again, problem. I don'’t trust you. Oh. Trust is so overrated. I have the money. You have the anthrax. Are we going to make a deal or not? Decisions. Decisions. I sell to you, you put me in prison. I kill you, it is open season on me. What to do? What to do? Perhaps I will invite your daughter to come and join us here? Oh. And why would you do that?Call it insurance. Besides, I'’d really like to get to know her. She has the cutest little... dimples. You go near my daughter, and I will try you some dimples. Gustavo Vasquez owns several resorts all over the Mediterranean, through which he launders millions of dollars a year. Only kind of laundry a man will do. His main business is brokering deals. Drugs, arms, secrets, art, it doesn'’t matter. Oh, a Renaissance man. Do you wanna hear this or not? Our main contact up until last night was Arturo. So what happened to him? He was terminated. Ah, Dinora. The place where all troubles disappear. What? It'’s just an island phrase I picked up from old Sid. So why did you and my mother come down here? We came down to get the statue of the Little Prince. Now it'’s this--Polynesian love god. Tribal art from Jungle, the coffee table. This is why my mother was kidnapped? I'’m not buying that. Yeah, well. It was on loan to the US when it was stolen. There has to be something more to it than that. It can'’t just be the statue. A gold bullion, microchip, something. I know you can'’t tell me, but don'’t you insult me by lying. Fine! We came down here to get the Little Prince and that'’s all I can tell you. See, isn'’t this so much better than lying? A girl always knows when a guy is lying to her. It'’s an instinctual thing. Unless she doesn'’t wanna know. Take this car behind us for example. It'’s been following us ever since the hotel. I knew. But I didn'’t wanna know. I have been keeping an eye on him. It could be nothing as long as he keeps his distance. [CAR REVVING] ALISON: And if he doesn'’t?RABBI: Don'’t worry. [CRASH] Now what? Okay. Now you can worry. [HORN TOOTING] Hang on! [CAR REVVING] Let'’s get out of here. Come on! Come on! [BRAKES SQUEALING] [GUN FIRING] Alison. Come on! Alison! This was definitely not in the brochure! RABBI: Get out of here. I'’ll cover you. They have semi automatics and you have a Lady Remington .22? Guns And The Men Who Love Them. [GRUNTS] Come on! Come on! I knew this was a bad idea. It'’s way too dangerous with you being in the middle. Now I gotta figure out a way to get you out of here, Alison. Alison! What are you... [GRUNTING] [HORSE NEIGHING] [YELPS] Uh, no, no, no. You go! Come on. Get on! RABBI: Go, get outta of here. What is your problem? I'’ve never ridden! That'’s okay. I'’m driving. [GRUNTS] [HORSE NEIGHING] That was not fun. Those were real bullets. They were trying to kill us. Hey, don'’t use that. Use the same one from the yellow flower over there. This is good. It'’s aloe. Resins in the yellow will clot the blood. Then you can use the aloe. How do you know? Exotic Flowers of the Third World. [SIGHS] What, you read every book ever printed? Ah, I wish. I'’m just a book editor. I'’m telling you that was scary and I'’ve gone head to head with George Trumbell. Who? Better Dead Than Sorry, Look But Don'’t Touch, Death Succumbs Her. Does anyone in the CIA read? Hey, will you calm down? Calm down? This is calm. This is calm for someone who'’s just been run off the road and shot at. Hey. Uh, you... you did great with the horse. Yeah. After I almost got you killed. You were right. I'’d be better just locked up in my hotel room or something. What was I thinking? I'’ll tell you what. Let'’s head back to the hotel. We can figure out everything there. Really?Yeah. Come on. All right. You got some dirt here. Oh. To think only yesterday my biggest problem was my boyfriend was missing. Well, he'’ll show up. He always does. Does everyone in the CIA know my personal life? Honestly, since the fall of Communism, there'’s not a whole lot else to talk about. Eric says it'’s all related to my mother, Mata Hari. Well, relationships are complicated. They sure are. Sometimes I feel like I'’m going to the hardware store for milk. Well, I think, secretary, it'’s done for the day. We better start walking before they find us. Hey, where are you going? This was is shorter. How do you know? You'’ve never been here before. There'’s a map in the hotel room. We can'’t afford to get lost. Let'’s just go back the way we came. All right. That was the way we came? We'’re on the road, aren'’t we? Now I know why it took you people 40 years to get out of the desert. We just can'’t waste any more time if we wanna get to Vasquez'’s island. We'’ve already taken forever. We'’ve just gone over... What do you mean, get to Vasquez'’s island? I... you said we'’re gonna head back to the hotel to regroup. Yeah. To get another car, to get to the boat to get to the island. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I thought you meant you were gonna drop me off and then you were-- Wait a minute. Don'’t you get it? The hotel'’s not safe anymore. Look. My partner, your mother, is gonna get her head blown off if we don'’t help her. I almost got you killed. That'’s not gonna help my mother. We'’ve been all over that. I cannot leave you unprotected, especially now. Look, let'’s recap, okay? I'’m a book editor, remember? Give me your book of rules and regulations. I'’ll make it into a best-seller. But I do not dodge bullets! Alison, this is not negotiable. I'’ll sit by the phone, I'’ll decode messages, I'’ll read maps, but you can'’t depend on me. I'’m not my mother! You can say that again!Hey, listen, pal. You do this superhero stuff for a living. You choose everyday to put your life in danger. I read! On top of that, I have just discovered in the last two hours that everything I thought I knew, is a big, fat, giant lie. The one thing I do know, bullets are bad. Me in the path of a bullet, very bad. Me getting you killed and leaving my mother no chance of escape, is very, very bad! So if you wanna keep trying to pull--Alison. Alison! What? Okay. I'’m sorry. Is this another trick? No. You'’re right. I apologize. Just like that? I... I don'’t know what I was thinking. I-- I guess seeing you in action, I mean, sure, you stumbled. We all do. Yeah, you wrecked the car. Yeah. I did. But, when you appeared on the horse, I guess you just reminded me of your mother so much, that I forgot that you were not a professional. You did? Uh-huh. So, you'’re right. And I'’m gonna rely on you to get yourself back to the hotel while I go and... try and find your mother. You should never use reverse psychology on me. I edited the book. Oh, that'’s good to know. Wait. I don'’t understand one thing. They'’ve got the statue, they'’ve got my mother, what do they want with us? Not us. You. Me? What can I give '’em? Insurance. For what? The agency has a policy about civilians. It'’s called "wait and see." Vasquez is trying to buy himself some more "wait and see" time until he can line up a new buyer. Really? So... so, if Vasquez had me, he'’d feel safe enough not to hurt my mother? Let'’s think this through. They either eventually capture both of us and we'’re screwed, or I let them capture me allowing you to get help and rescue us. No way! It'’s too dangerous. Oh, well then. Maybe you better start running. Alison, what are you doing? Counting on you! Alison! [GUNSHOTS FIRING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [GROANS] You are just like your mother. [MOTORBOAT STARTING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] ALISON: Thank you. I hate to think all those hours on the StairMaster were a complete waste of time. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey. Hi.Good afternoon, sir. You have a message.Oh, great. Oh, all right. Uh, listen, uh, I need another rental car. Compact? Mid-sized? Anything is better than that golf cart you had me in. Solow here.RABBI: It'’s morning. Where are you? What happened? I was stranded in Morocco by a sandstorm. What'’s going on there? Vasquez has Gloria and Alison. What? Alison? How the hell did-- Look, I'’ll tell you about it later, all right? When can you get here? SOLOW: It'’s hard to say. Wait a minute. Didn'’t Herb Kulcheck retire over there? Uh, who is he? He'’s a former agent. He went independent. He still dabbles a bit, but he really owns the restaurant. All right. Listen, I'’ll check it out. Oh, and one other thing. A Pakistani businessman left here on a flight just before the sandstorm. A new buyer for Vasquez? Yeah, that'’s what we think. Look, I'’ll be in touch. [TIRES SCREECHING] [FOLK MUSIC PLAYING] [EXHALES] Miss Shaeffer? It is a pleasure to meet you. Where'’s my mother? I wanna see her. Don'’t worry. Your mother is fine. I am Gustavo Vasquez. You are very, very beautiful. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] As I was telling Wren and Stimpy here, it'’s all due to my StairMaster. I don'’t suppose you have a gym on the island? [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING GERMAN] [SPEAKING GERMAN] That would be all. You... are as amusing... as you are beautiful. Only to those who don'’t know me.Oh? What do those who really know you feel? Impotent? Listen... I'’m not gonna lie to you. I'’m attracted to you, I'’m very attracted to you. You'’re just my type. But I'’m learning my type is bad news for me. I end up giving you everything I'’ve got and it's never enough, it'’s never gonna be enough, '’cause you're incapable of accepting love, real love, into your life. So, I'’m here to work out some stuff with my mother so I can stop falling for tall, dark, handsome, self-obsessed men such as yourself. So where is she? Mom? Alison? Are you all right? I was so worried. [GASPS] Is... is that all you wore? You tell me that you and the Rabbi are dating to cover up for the fact that you work for the CIA, and you'’ve been lying to me my entire life, and you ask me if this is all I'’m wearing? Can you keep your voice down? No, I will not keep my voice down! What are you afraid it'’ll disturb our captors? Why didn'’t you just go off with Grandma, the way I asked you to? You cannot keep palming me off on Grandma! I did no such thing! Are you hungry? No, you know, it'’s funny. I kind of lost my appetite when I found out my entire childhood was a lie! Alison, we cannot discuss this now. You can blame everything on me later. Right now, we'’ve got to get out of here. Now, where is the Rabbi? I... I assume, trying to find his way on to the island. You mean you'’re here alone? I'’m gonna kill him. [SIGHS] Well, were you never gonna tell me the truth? Do you think it was easy to lie to you? Yeah. Wasn'’t it? No! It was the most difficult thing I'’ve ever done in my life. You just wait. What, wait till when? Till when? Till I have children of my own? Like that'’ll ever happen. What do you mean? Is there something wrong? No, no. No! Not like that. What I mean is, don'’t expect me to have a normal life. I was not raised normal. Oh, I'’m so sorry you had such a tough life. So sorry the only camp you ever went to was Camp David. No, I am not saying there weren'’t good times. What I'’m saying is that when you and Daddy kept disappearing-- Yeah, but we always came back. Yet I was always trying to make sense out of things that didn'’t make sense! If you would just--You'’ve said enough! We'’ll talk about this later. Right now, I have to concentrate on a way to get us off of this island alive. And is it company policy that all the agents have to clean before they escape? I'’m checking for bugs. I can'’t believe you went to Chelsea'’s first mixer. I tried to get out of it. I know. Hillary insisted. MAN: Senor Vasquez thought that this would be more comfortable for you. Yes, will you just tell Senor Vasquez that my daughter has absolutely no information at all. Oh, why don'’t you tell Senor Vasquez that I'’d be happy to tell him more? Mm. Native Apparel. Don'’t you dare. You just tell Senor Vasquez that if he really wants to make it comfortable for my daughter, that he could just let her go, instead of trying to dress her up like some... some...some...some... Mediterranean Barbie. ALISON: Oh, I think it'’s gonna fit. Imagine that. What do you mean it fits? Alison, you get out here now! MAN: Stop it. Stop it already. It'’s bad enough I have to listen to this kind of stuff at home. Why does everything have to be an argument? [DOOR CLOSES] Voila. What do you think you'’re doing? Take it off. What'’s the big deal? I said take it off. Alison Rebbecca, I'’ve had it with you. You either take that dress off right now or I'’ll take it off for you. Oh, God, you'’re impossible. You are so impossible. After the kidnapping, I vowed I would never involve you in my-- What kidnapping? Uh... Alison, can this wait? No. What kidnapping? [SIGHS] You were almost four. We were in Israel. Your father and I were traveling as a young couple with a small child. We were also carrying some highly sensitive documents. I can'’t believe how naive we were, but there was no other way. It was right after the Six-Day War. The United States had promised. So, who got kidnapped? You. What? Three days and three long nights. I was insane. So that'’s why. If it feels to you sometimes like I'’m pushing you away, I am. But not because I don'’t love you, not because I don'’t care, but because I am so afraid for your life. And what happened? We found you-- We didn'’t, our contact, Achmed, found you. ALISON: Achmed? [DOOR OPENING] ALISON: Achmed. Achmed was rescuing me. I'’ve been having Achmed dreams for 25 years. Why didn'’t you tell me? [GLORIA SCREAMING][SCREAMS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Mom! What?That was amazing! We need some more rope. How come you never let me take karate lessons? GLORIA: Look at this. We were being guarded by a man who doesn'’t even have a gun. Now that'’s disgraceful. MAN: I have the gun. Move away from him. Hands in the air. Give me the key to the room and take off your belt. Hands in the air! Give me your belt. Hands in the air! Alison, he can'’t do both. Oh, yeah. Right. Never had such a big gun before. Give me your belt. Make a loop. Quickly. Make a loop. Put it around your wrists. Attaboy. Now follow me. Check the door. Check the door. [GRUNTS] How'’s it look?ALISON: Clear. Bye, bye, Pancho. [GROANS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISPERS] Come on. That was fun. It is not a game.I know that. Yeah, just make sure you do. This way. [GENTLE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] RABBI: Excuse me. I'’m looking for Herb Kulcheck. You found him. I can'’t believe all these years you let me think you didn'’t care, rather than trust me with the truth. I still wouldn'’t have been there. Now you wait here. Right here. Don'’t move. [BIRDS CHIRPING] What are you doing? If you weren'’t rejecting me, I would'’ve known the reasons for your leaving had nothing to do with me. Alison, you can'’t take everything so personally. Sometimes you don'’t get to know the why of things. [SCOFFS]All right, see that boat down there? We should go down, get in that boat, and get off this island. ALISON: I don'’t think that'’s a good idea. Don'’t start with me--Look, the wind is coming from the west. They'’ll hear the motor. We have a much better chance if we paddle out on that sailboat. The wind is strong enough to take us out to the mainland. Where on earth did you learn all those things? Grandma.Grand... All right. All right. Just...just do what you think is best. Baby, be careful. Be careful. What are you talking about? You'’re going too? No, I can'’t. I gotta go back and get the statue. This one has a vial of anthrax enough to eliminate half of Europe. So that'’s what he couldn'’t tell me. Then I'’m definitely not leaving you here.Yes, you are. No, I'’m not. Please don'’t argue with me and do as I tell you. Stop being a mom.When you get off this island. I can do this if you would just get out of here.[MOTORBOAT APPROACHING] Shh. Get down. [WHISPERING] I wonder who that is. ALISON: Wait. Wait. I'’ve got something. [ALISON LIP-READING] Ah, Mr. Dinte, welcome. How was your trip? Fine. Fine. Is everything six? If you have the money. GLORIA: When did you learn to read lips? When they invented the Walkman. Dinte must be Vasquez'’s buyer. [GUN COCKING] Hey, where are you taking her? Mom! HERB: Now you gotta taste this. I'’m waiting for a shipment of guns, I run into this guy who'’s a chef. Come on, sit down. Relax. So. What can I do for you? I need to get on to Vasquez'’s island. He'’s got one of our agents and a civilian. I could. Come on, eat. It'’s unbelievable. Yum. Good. So, can you do this? Of course, I can. How much?How much you got? [LAUGHS] Hey, I'’m kidding. Tell Marty I'’ll put it on his tab, all right? Well, I got a map back at my office. Eat. Be right back. [DOOR OPENS] You look lovely. You picked it out. I do have a good eye. But you have added a delightful flair. Would you like a drink? No, thank you. Do you mind?I understand. Understand?Needing a drink. Sometimes I make men nervous. Really? And why do you think that is? I don'’t know. [EXHALES DEEPLY] I was hoping you could tell me. Oh. And I was hoping for something more. I... only wanted to freshen up. Do you need to search? You'’re getting very hard... to resist. Go. Leave the door unlocked. [EXHALES] [GROANS] [YELPS] You'’ll be just fine, buddy... but I'’d definitely consider another profession. Okay. Now, the best place to get on the island is here. Extremely shallow and rocky. Low tide, the guards take their break. How can you be so sure? '’Cause they all come over at my place for my avocado soup. It'’s my specialty. Hey, Jose, bring him a bowl of soup, would you? No, thank you. So when'’s low tide? In about two hours. Now you sit, have a little soup, a little salad, then we go and rescue your people. Dinora. The place where all your troubles disappear. [LAUGHS] I heard that about Dinora. Cheers. Cheers. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Who is it? VASQUEZ: Very funny. I thought you said you did not want a drink. Don'’t you know the difference between when a woman says "No" and means no, and when a woman says "Yes" and means yes? No. [LAUGHS] So... where'’s the statue everyone wants to get their hands on? VASQUEZ: Not everyone. Some of us would like to get our hands on... other things. It'’s over there. It really contains anthrax? I don'’t want to talk business. To tonight. May it be full of surprises. Mmm. So, what would you like to talk about, then? Yes. Tell me, why do you think I'’m such a bad boy? Gee, I don'’t know. Could it be your amoral lifestyle and your commitment to crime? That? That is nothing. I just do it for the money and the power. But is it worth it? The hours seem kind of long. That is true, but the commute isn'’t so bad. [CHUCKLING] VASQUEZ: I like you. And despite all my therapy, I like you too. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MAN SPEAKING SPANISH] [GROANS] Excuse me, hmm? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] What was that all about? I, uh, I wanted to get your attention. But now you'’ve got it. [LAUGHS] What'’s so amusing? Well, it seems that your people went and hired a sub-contractor. First of all, they are not my people. And second of all, what'’s a sub-contractor?A mercenary. Oh. [CHUCKLES] And do you know what the funniest part is?What? They hired Herb. And Herb, when he'’s not cooking, he works for me. [CHUCKLES] Oh, the world is a crazy place, eh? Salud. Mm. Well, we'’re all set. All we have to do is pick up some wet-suits. Why don'’t you send them for the wet suits? We can meet them at the dock. Good idea. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Is this you?I was ten. I just knocked over my first papaya stand. Oh. You'’ve come a long way. We are both very much alike, you and I. We both like to break the rules, each one in our own way, in our own worlds. But we break them. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] [MEN SPEAKING IN SPANISH] [ALISON AND VASQUEZ CHUCKLING] Are you all right? I'’m better than all right. Don'’t you think I should be the judge of that? Oh. Foam'’s the best part. [CHUCKLES] [MUFFLED YELLING] [TIRES SCREECHING] You have amazing eyes, huh. They have, uh, little tiny brown specks in them. Can you see? Ooh!Oh! You'’re falling for me.Oh, I don'’t know what'’s wrong with me. I think the blood might be rushing from your head to, uh, other places? Oh, yes. That'’s right. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] What are you doing all the way over there? Normally I play hard to get, but... I can'’t wait. [VASQUEZ CHUCKLES] I cannot blame you. [MUSIC FIZZLES OUT] Sweet dreams, papaya boy. Don'’t tell me Grandma taught you all that. Mom? You saw? Saw? I took notes. You were great, girl. Help me. [GRUNTS]Okay. [GRUNTS] Here. Cover yourself up. I need some rope. Aah... What'’d you knock him out with? This flower which has sedative properties. It'’s immediate but short term. Okay. We gotta move fast then. Come on, let'’s go.Wait a sec. Wait a sec.Let'’s go. We'’re gonna need this. What? I don'’t know, but it's important enough for him to lock up. All right. Let'’s move. The statue! Let'’s go. There you go. Excuse me, can we leave now? Oh... [KNOCK ON DOOR] [GROANS] Senor Vasquez? [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] No, you idiots. La estatua. Where'’s the statue? [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] [GROANS] Senor Dinte... [ADVENTUROUS MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] [GROANS] Mom! Mom, are you all right?[GROANS] Yeah, I'’m all right. Get going. ALISON: Are you crazy? You'’re bleeding. You gotta get off this island.I am not leaving you! You have got to do this. Now, go! I'’ll stall them while you get off. Go! Go! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS FIRING] [GUNSHOTS FIRING] [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Come on! The girl! [GUNSHOTS FIRING] MAN:Stop shooting, you might hit the statue! [MOTOR STALLS] Oh, come on, George "100,000,000 books sold" Trumbell. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] [MOTOR STARTING] Yes! James Bond, eat your heart out. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah. It'’s me. Alison'’s on her way. Meet her at the pier. She'’s got the statue. What about you? Don'’t worry about me. Get Alison. I'’m on my way. Which pier? [MOTORBOATS ZOOMING] Gotcha! Alison Shaeffer. Daughter of Gloria Shaeffer, who is now dating the Rabbi. Alonzo. Boy, what great service. [GRUNTS] Careful. Oh, careful. [GUN COCKS] I don'’t believe this. I'’ll take the statue. Ah, damn. ALONZO: Come on, hurry it up. You wanna give me a hand? [GRUNTS] [GUNSHOTS] RABBI: Alison! Are you okay? ALISON: I think so. My mom... Did you get my mom? Yeah, she called. She'’s fine. Hey, you did great. Oh, what, this? It was nothing. Well, I'’m very, very proud of you. May I? Yeah. Thanks. [APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS]MAN: Alison! Alison, are you all right? Uncle Marty, what are you doing here? It'’s about time, Marty. Where'’s Gloria? She'’s headed back to the hotel. We got Dinte, and Vasquez and his men. Is that it?Yeah. Not you too. [SIGHS] I'’m afraid so. Uncle Marty, here'’s the disk. Mom. GLORIA: Alison! Oh! Ow. Are you all right? I'’m fine. Are you all right?Yes, it'’s nothing. PETER: Ali! Alison!Oh, my God. It'’s Peter. That'’s Peter? Mm. She has the strangest taste in men, doesn'’t she? Peter, what are you doing here? I... was worried when you didn'’t return my calls. You know, suddenly, all these things ran through my head. I didn'’t know how... well, the way we left things-- The way we... the way we left things was you left. After you said those awful things. I told you I loved you and wanted to marry you. Exactly. Ah, Peter, uh... let'’s not start something we should be finishing. Good. Wait. What does that mean? I can'’t do this anymore. Do what? This. Us. You and me. The plural thing. What are you talking about? I came all the way over here so you can dump me? Yes. And, uh, if you hurry, you can just make the 3:00 p.m. flight. Ali, wait! Does this mean that you'’re not gonna read my book? I said if you hurry. So, we done here now? Case closed, bad guys caught, world saved? Not exactly. [CAR STARTING] No. No! No, no, no, no way! You'’re not doing this. I can'’t let you do it. Mom, would you please calm down? I am calm. I'’m very calm for a mother whose daughter is gonna let herself be used as bait. How else are we gonna get Vasquez?It doesn'’t matter. And stop saying "we"! You'’re not "we," I'’m "we"! I was "we". Yeah, but now you'’re back to you. I don'’t wanna go back to that "me". I like the me that was "we". Can'’t you see?Will you cut it out. Come on, Mom, aren'’t you the least bit relieved that everything is out in the open?No. Yes. I don'’t know. Maybe. [SIGHS] The day you were born, and believe it or not, I was there for that. The day you were born, the first minute I saw you, I knew I would do everything I could do to protect you. And you did. I didn'’t make all those sacrifices for you to throw yourself in the middle of everything now. I mean, what is the point? I hope you did it so I could grow up and make my own decisions. Like tonight.[HUFFS] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Would you care to dance? I'’d love to. I can'’t believe this is happening. I can'’t watch. You okay? I'’m a little nervous. Is this better? This is what'’s making me nervous. Just kidding! Kinda. Alison. There'’s something I have to tell you. Oh, no, now what? I'’m not really a Rabbi. Oh. Not even a Talmud scholar? Disappointed? No. I'’m just trying to remember if I told you anything in confidence that I wouldn'’t have told you if I didn'’t think you'’re a Rabbi. Like what? Well... anything of an intimate nature. Intimate? I don'’t remember. Thank you. I don'’t even know your real name. Oh. It'’s Gary. Gary Sutton. [CHUCKLES] Think I like Rabbi better. Everything'’s in place. So is there anything else you wanna tell me? Kiss me. Hold that thought. May I have this dance? Oh. You! Hi. Yes, that is a gun. But I'’m also very happy to see you. Really? Why? Call it unfinished business. Funny. That'’s not how I see it. Mom and I are safe. We'’ve got the anthrax. Dinte and Herb are in custody. No. We'’re done. Tell me, Alison, do you believe in fate? Only when I don'’t get what I want. I can'’t imagine that happens very often. Well, you'’d be surprised. I always get what I want. And now, I want something that only you can provide. How did I know that? I don'’t know. After you. I'’m right behind you. Can I go to the ladies'’? No. Keep moving. Before we get to more personal matters, I would like my disk back. I'’ll bet you would. It'’s quite an interesting list of politicians and government officials you have on your payroll. Just give it back to me. Please. How about you drop your gun and we don'’t kill you? Would you like to tango? I don'’t tango. [GUNS COCKING] I don'’t really think you wanna die. Just a temporary setback. Let'’s go. Mm-hmm. Just tell me one thing. Are you seeing anyone? Get him out of here. Next time, I will mix the drinks. Nice work, you guys! Are you okay?I'’m fine. The kiss worked great. Nice touch. I'’m gonna have to remember that. Gloria, give me a hand with the locals, will you, please? See you back in the room. The kiss was a signal? Yeah. Of course. What... you didn'’t think that was real, did you? Oh, my God. You did. I am so sorry. I--I thought for sure you knew that wasn'’t a real kiss. But how was I supposed to know that? Because this is a real kiss. See the difference? Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. [SERENE MUSIC PLAYING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [DOOR OPENING] GLORIA: Ali? Ali. ALISON: Out here. You okay? Yeah. Tonight was terrifying. Exhilarating! [SIGHS] I know. I can'’t imagine ever doing anything like that again. But... how can I not? I'’m very proud of you. You are?Yeah. Turn around. I believe this is yours. You sure? Absolutely. Positively. And if I did say so myself, you'’re a chip off the old block. Thanks, Mom. And I get it. It does run in the family. Come on. Let'’s raid the mini bar. Wait. What do you mean, "runs in the family"? [BIRDS CHIRPING] Grandma. Hi, darling! Why didn'’t you tell me? What? That I worked for the CIA and... that Churchill and I were like this? You never told me that! Hah! GARY: Alison. You ready? Oh. Gotta go. Bye, darling. Bye, darling. [CAR STARTS] Does she know he'’s not a real Rabbi? She'’s your granddaughter. She knows everything. [LAUGHS] ALISON: So I'’m starting a new chapter in my life with a new man, a well-earned necklace, and the blessings of both my mother and my grandmother. It'’s funny how my entire world has been turned upside down yet, now it all makes sense. Maybe there'’s a book in it. I'’ll have to let you know. [TANGO MUSIC PLAYING]
