[music playing] Where to now, buddy? Hang on. Hey, Bruce, don't forget the tape recorder. Thanks. Tape everything you hear. OK. I'll do that. I'll get it to you tomorrow? - All right. You know where I'll be-- JFK at 2:00 PM. Yeah. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. Good luck. HECTOR: And this is Alberto Fujimora's prosperous country. And this is the tissue of lies he feeds the rest of the world. Please sit down. The Western world-- - Sorry. Excuse me. HECTOR: --considers Peru a Democratic country. Hi. HECTOR: But in reality-- You mind if I sit here? Go ahead. HECTOR: --based on a dictator who cares nothing for things like justice and freedom. And the poor people, the uneducated, these are the people that pay for his economic theories. And the rich, they get richer, and they're starving people with nothing-- This guy's looking for trouble. This guy is my boyfriend. Nice-looking fella. Thanks. I think. HECTOR: --no food for days. You see? I'd like to speak to your boyfriend after the lecture. What for? I'm a reporter for the "New World Times". I'm doing a series of articles on the South American economy. Bruce Nelson. Elena Pederson. Nice to meet you. [music playing in spanish] [chatter] [chatter continues] Hector Carpa, November 22, 1996. And Elena, Canadian-Peruvian mix. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Um, Hector, this is Bruce Nelson, the reporter then I told you about. So you want to interview me? Yes. Yes, I'd like that very much. It might be easier for you if I don't use your real name. So if you want anonymity, I promise I never disclose my sources. For now, I'd appreciate it. I have to go back home soon and-- How soon? How come you didn't tell me? HECTOR: Mi amor, we'll talk about it later. OK, so what do you want to know? I hear there's a strong underground movement in Peru opposing Fujimori's regime? This is true, but it is also true that Peru has one of the most sophisticated secret police in the whole world. So life is not so simple for the young rebels. And do you consider yourself a rebel? I have many friends who spend their lives hiding in the jungle. I have other friends who spend their lives in jail. If, in your eyes, that makes me a rebel, then OK. Hector, do you know if the MRTA is planning to assassinate the president? This is not possible. This man is untouchable, even more so than your president in Washington. Would you if you could? What? Assassinate the president. Would you if you could? I would. Just take me down to Lima, give me a gun. This guy Hector, he's a real terrorist. He could lead us right to the MRTA rebels. Here, read this. Oh, I almost forgot. Little audio surprise for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Well, it sounds like you found yourself a way in. Yeah. So good job. Thank you, sir. All right, Bruce. I'll see you down there. You know where to find me. Yeah. Have a good flight, jefe. JEFF: Thank you. [music playing] [chatter] Hola. Everything you need should be here. Hector Carpa is on the plane. He's in baggage now. He should be along in just a few minutes. I will handle it from here. Mr. Carpa. Yes? What do you want? Would you come with us, please? Why? Who are you? - You should come-- - Huh? - --very quietly. - Why? What have I done? Huh? You're under arrest. Can I use the telephone? I want to call my father, OK? - Silencio. Please? Please, I want to call my lawyer. You have no right. Huh? Silencio. Huh? Can I use the telephone? I want to call my family, OK? Soldado, por aqu ! S r pido! R pido! R pido! Move! Move! Get out of the way! [grunting] - All ! - Come on. Let's go. Let's go! Sigalo. R pido, sigalo. [inaudible] right now. V monos! V monos! We have him trapped. [grunting] MAN: Alto! Alto! Idiota! OFFICER [ON RADIO]: [speaking spanish] [grunting] [yelling] Move! Get out of the way! V monos! [honking] NUN: Oh, pobrecito. [chatter in spanish] Welcome to the end of the road, Mr. Carpa. NUN: Oh, Santa perd a. It was a beautiful ride. ELENA: Hello? Hello? MAN [ON PHONE]: [speaking spanish] ELENA: Hello? MAN [ON PHONE]: [speaking spanish] There's a message in Spanish, and I think it's saying that the number's been disconnected. Let me listen. MAN [ON PHONE]: [speaking spanish] Yeah, that's exactly what it's saying. What do you think it means? Think he's in trouble? I don't know. Would you want to go down there? - To Peru? - Yeah. Aren't you are a Peruvian citizen? Yeah. Um, I think I should go. OK. Well, we'll book ourselves a flight. We? Yeah, we. I have a colleague down there. If Hector's in trouble, he can help us out. Besides, I've been wanting to go down there for my story, anyway. MONTICITO: General Frantacino. Open up. HECTOR: Let me go! I tell you nothing! [zapping] Let's see. [music playing] [chatter] Thanks. [speaking spanish] Est bien. Where is he? BRUCE: I don't see him. - Great. Why don't you take a taxi? Go to the hotel, check us out a couple rooms. I'm going to look for my colleague. Why didn't he show up? I mean, don't you think that's kind of strange? Oh, a little bit, but I have an idea of where I can find him. Look, I'm going to rent a car. I'll hook up with you in a little bit, OK? OK. Just don't be too long. You going to be all right? Yeah. Esta mujer. So this Elena girl is down here with me, back at the hotel. Hector Carpa's girlfriend. I'm telling you, this is a prime opportunity, Jeff. If I can use her to get me in touch with the MRTA rebels, and they let me into their headquarters, we've got a hell of a story. Well, the Peruvian authorities would like to get into their headquarters, too. Look. Take a look at this. We believe they'll be in an area of the jungle up north called the war zone. Now, I must warn you that if you do succeed in getting into that area, it will be extremely dangerous. But you will get your Pulitzer. OK. Now let's assume that I make it into the jungle. I'm at the headquarters. How will I get in touch with you? Look. Take a look at this. This is a radio transmitter that travels only long distances. It's used as a secure radio frequency. Use it only during emergencies or breaking news. [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] S , su Excellency. BRUCE [ON RADIO]: Hector, do you know if the MRTA is planning to assassinate the president? HECTOR [ON RADIO]: This is not possible. This man is untouchable, even more so than your president in Washington. BRUCE [ON RADIO]: Would you if you could? HECTOR [ON RADIO]: What? BRUCE [ON RADIO]: Assassinate the president. Would you if you could? Would you do it if you could? Alto! Alto! Alto! Alto! [chatter] So when do we get to meet your leader? Yeah. When do we get to speak to Victor Bernales? You are speaking to Victor Bernales. Welcome to my jungle. Delicia, some Peruvian coffee? Do you have information about Hector? He was sentenced to life in prison by the secret martial court tribunal. No parole. Why? What has he done? They have the same charge for all of us-- treason against the fatherland of Peru. Which means? Simply that you do not agree with Fujimori and his regime. Are you telling me that he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison, and there's nothing that we can do about it? Believe me. We need him more than you. We know in which prison they are holding him. It is a place of solitude high in the Andes Mountains. We have been working on a plan to break in. Wait a minute. You mean to tell me you're planning on breaking in the Canto Grande Prison? How do you know of this place? I've heard about it. They say hell itself couldn't be worse. A revolution is coming. We need our people. We cannot let them just rot in that rat hole. ELENA: Can we help you? Can we join you? [music playing] Open. [chatter in spanish] [music playing] Where you going? I'm just going to the bathroom. Go back to sleep. Jeff, can you hear me? JEFF [ON PHONE]: This is Jeff. What's up? Over. - Jeff. JEFF [ON PHONE]: Go ahead. I'm at the MRTA camp. I have sensational news. V monos! BRUCE: They're planning to get Hector Carpa out of Campo Grande. They will attack the prison in the morning and release all the prisoners. [music playing] Troops, v monos. V monos! [music playing] Hold there. [grunting] [grunting] Look out, Bruce! [yelling] Libertad! Sigalo! Sigalo! Cuidado! Cuidado! [yelling] Get back. Back. Back.

Hector! No, it is a trap. Fujimori's commandos were waiting for us. We must get back to the jungle. No! I gotta find Hector. - No! Delicia. Delicia, it is a trap. Take the men back to the jungle. - S , Victor. The jungle. Vamos. Elena! [chatter] Hector! Hector, are you in there? Elena! Elena, it is a trap! - Hector! - No. It is a trap. They were waiting for us. No, I am not leaving here without Hector. Elena! Hector! VICTOR: Elena, no. [grunting] ELENA: Hector! Elena, no. HECTOR: Elena! Hector? HECTOR: Vic-- Victor! - Hector? He is here. Hector? Hector, Get back. Back! Hector, get back! Hector? Hector! What took you so long? Traffic. Traffic, huh? Better late than never. Hector? VICTOR: Vamos. - Mi amor. VICTOR: Vamos. Vamos. God, what did they do to you? It's OK. It's OK. Hector, no hay tiempo. V monos. OK. Come on! Come on. What's going on? Why are there so many soldiers? Fujimori's commandos, amigo. What?

Look who is, this stinking little rat. Drop your gun or I'll kill her! Drop it! Hector, we must go back to the jungle. We must go back to the jungle. Elena! Hector, we must. HECTOR: Elena! Elena! Frantacino. S , Victor. Finally, face to face. I was looking forward to it. I'm sorry you have to die. [clicks] MONTICITO: [laughing] It's your turn to die. It's a good day to die. [speaking spanish] Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Come on. [chatter] No! Don't! No! No, don't! No, I didn't do anything! No! No! I didn't do anything. No. No! No, no! Stop it! No! Let me go, please! I didn't do anything. I'm sorry you had to leave so soon. The information you provided was invaluable. Thanks on behalf of the American consulate. Just wanted you to know what was going on. [speaking spanish] Gracias. Take care. Have a safe flight. What's the matter? Is there some kind of celebration the next few days in Lima? Yes. There's a reception at the Japanese ambassador's residence. They're celebrating the emperor's birthday. Everybody who's anybody is going to be invited. Are you anybody? Are you staying? Well, if you take me with you. Let's go. Come on. [chatter] Come in. Hello, Ambassador. Hello. [music playing] [chatter] Yes, OK. I will go get more champagne? This is all right with you? Yes, it is OK. [inaudible] Now, there's a beautiful woman for you, Padre. Peruvian. Excuse me, Ambassador Aoki? Ambassador Albright has an important phone call from President Clinton, and we must leave. Ah, sou. Clinton? Yes. Sou desu ka. Sorry you cannot stay. Thank you for coming, Ambassador. Thank you. I'll call you. Please allow me to introduce myself, Your Excellency. I know who you are. Phoebe, correct? You can't hide anything from the Japanese diplomats. I'm Phoebe Pratt. Welcome to my home, Miss Pratt. Please. Excuse me. Wow. Se ora. You have beautiful eyes. Gracias, se ora. Se orita. The American ambassador just left. We should've planned the raid for 7 o'clock. Don't worry, Hector. Plenty of important people here. OK? I think we have about 300 of the most important people in Peruvia. I wish Fujimori was here, though. He may still come, Hector. We wait? No. No. [sirens blaring] They're here right on time. Alto. [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] S . Let's do it. [speaking spanish] On the floor now! Al piso! Get down on the floor! [screaming] Get down on the floor! Everybody on the floor, OK? Nobody gets hurt if you're on the floor. Down on the floor. You won't get hurt if you're on the floor. - Get down on the floor now! - OK? No one will get hurt! Get down on the floor! Anybody who is standing will be shot! HECTOR: Get down, OK? Everybody on the floor. We don't want to hurt anybody, but we will-- Get down, [speaking spanish]! Now! Stay down! Stay down now! Put your hands behind your head and do not move. [distant crying] If you're on the ground, you will not get hurt. [gunfire] Stay down! You heard me! Stay down now! [speaking spanish] Down! [speaking spanish] Good evening. General Frantacino, did any group assume responsibility? I have no information from inside the compound as yet, my president. List of the guests? I have contacted the Japanese Embassy, and they're putting together a list for us. Approximately 300 people are inside the ambassador's residence. 300? Unfortunately. That's very bad. [yelling] One reporter and one cameraman. We are ready. [inaudible] is ready. One! Only one. The movimiento revolucionario addresses our beloved Peruvian people. That one. That is the one that led the attack on the prison. --the MRTA Special Forces unit-- Confirms they are MRTA. --the Japanese Ambassador to Peru. We have named this operation Breaking the Silence. We want the world to know what is going on here in Peru. We will only free the hostages if President Fujimori complies with the following demands. All prisoners belonging to the MRTA and every prisoner accused of belonging to any other political movement will be set free. HECTOR: Patria o muerte, venceremos. MONTICITO: Patria o muerte, venceremos. Patria o muerte, venceremos! What the hell did he say at the end? Do you understand Spanish? He said, "Fatherland or death, we will overcome." It's what the Cuban revolutionaries used to say. Jesus. They're going to kill us all. They're not killers. Oh, come on, man. They're bloody terrorists. They're rebels. You always right? I am. Well, you of all people in here should understand the difference. The difference is that terrorists do it for the pure joy of terror, where rebels do it for their bloody ideals, which doesn't matter a damn to those who are about to be killed. They are so young. I don't think they mean to kill. You're too young to understand what radicals are capable of. You're very beautiful. Muchas gracias, se or. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to put your hands down, take a deep breath, relax, and listen. ALL: [sighing] You all saw me on the TV. We expect the government to comply with our demands. So hopefully, you will spend just one night in here. DELICIA: [wailing] Antonio. S , Victor? Go and ask the hostages if one of them is a doctor. She needs an operation. S , V. DELICIA: [wailing continues] Delicia, [inaudible]. It's going to be OK. I'm a priest. I heard someone is dying. VICTOR: No one is dying, Padre. She needs a doctor. I was a doctor before I became a priest. Can you get the bullet out and stop the bleeding, Padre, or she will die. I need more than a knife. I need anesthesia, anti-septics. Delicia, drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. The rest is your anesthetic. Now do your job, and do it well. At least get me hot water and towels. - I'll get it, Padre. - And be quick! [music playing] [crying] [snoring] What is your name? Lily. Well, Lily, I am James. Thank you, Padre. I know. I know. We've been at it all night. Oh, we're doing our best. Yes. OK. OK. Damn! Mr. President, I must reiterate. We cannot negotiate. The minute we begin to negotiate is the minute that we begin to lose. We heard that already, Frantacino. What is your alternative plan? Anybody. Anybody, give me an alternative plan. [knocking] Yes! Mr. President, the American press attach is here with a message from the American president. Wasn't this press attach at the party along with the American Ambassador? They left 15 minutes before the raid. Ah, the Americans. They always know better. Mr. President. Good morning, gentlemen. Please sit down, sir. I spoke with the White House a few minutes ago. President Clinton wishes to assure you the United States is willing to help in any way to bring this situation to an end. What is your opinion, Mr. Campbell? Should we negotiate? Absolutely not. The United States policy is never to negotiate with terrorists. President Clinton's position is terrorists must not be rewarded. Well, I think we would agree with that. However, we do need an alternative plan. The suggestion is to buy time. That way, you can examine all your options. But at any moment, the terrorists are going to begin to kill the hostages. Are you suggesting that we wait for this moment? We must calculate our moves wisely so that nobody gets killed. ALL [CHANTING]: Libredos! Libredos! Libredos! Libredos! Libredos! Libredos! Libredos! [music playing] What, honey? Oh, I know, sweetie. You have to go potty, but there's a long line. So I don't know. [coughing] Hey, Herman! Herman! This man-- Hey! This man is crazy! Well, we've been holding 300 hostages for six days already. Now what? Do not worry. They will do what we said. They cannot put all these important people's lives in danger. In a few days, it will all be over. Maybe even today. Victor, you said this yesterday. Something will happen today, Hector. I feel it. I hope you're right. [music playing] [chatter] So how is my little Delicia? Gracias, Padre. Thank you for saving my life. It was God who saved your life, my child, not me. Let me look at the wound. Why do they call you Delicia, young man? Because I'm Delicia. I'm a woman. A woman? Oh, sou desu ka. Then you are a very brave young woman, Delicia. But too young for this. I'm not young, Mr. Ambassador. I will be 16 next month. Oh, 16? I have a daughter your age. Is she in the jungle? No. I would never permit her to be in the jungle. She will never ask for your permission, Mr. Ambassador. Then thank God she's in Japan and not here. You don't have a jungle in Japan? No. Jungle in Japan not like Peru. VICTOR [ON RADIO]: Delicia. Delicia, do you read me? Over. This is Delicia. VICTOR [ON RADIO]: What is your status? Everything is quiet over here. Never leave your gun alone, young lady. One bullet can cause a lot of blood. What's kind of gun is it? This is a Russian Kalashnikov. It's better than the American M16. I have never held a gun in my life. Do you know how to use it? Of course. Here, let me show you. Here. Delicia! Please, don't be angry. It's-- it's my fault. She's a good girl. She meant no harm. Get out. Both of you, out! You take apart your rifle while the hostages are in the room? Endanger our mission and the lives of the other men? But Victor, they're a frien-- No! No one is our friend here. They hate us. They call us terrorists. Put it back together and do not do this again. S , Victor. When you feel better, you come down to the bigger room and replace Antonio. He needs to sleep. S ? S . [chatter] Listen, you. If I ever see you talking to my people again-- Look, how dare you talk to this gentleman that way. And you address me as Your Excellency or Mr. Ambassador. Do you understand? Mr. Ambassador, huh? Well, you listen to me, Mr. Ambassador. Here you are just another hostage. And maybe you are a dead piece of shit hostage. So you'd better shut your mouth before I shut it for you, Mr. Ambassador. Do you understand, Your Excellency? Do you enjoy your power. Mr. Bernales, use that girl to show how strong you are? But you are nothing but a scum terrorist! [gasping] ALL: Terrorist! Terrorist! Terrorist! Calm down! Come with me, you Japanese bastard! Come on. Antonio. Brother, you can't kill him. I'm still your commander! I take responsibility. Why do you start this? They're just a bunch of innocent kids. Kids like that, in my country, Father, would shoot you without even thinking twice. They are terrorists, and they gotta be dealt with like terrorists. Come here. You all know the Japanese Ambassador to Peru, His Excellency Morihisha Aoki. So take a good look at him. This is my last warning! I will kill him right here, right now if our demands are not met immediately! Free our comrades or all of the hostages will die! Fujimori, I know that you watch me now from your palace! He doesn't have the courage to do it. He's mad enough to do it. Look at his crazed eyes. This man's blood is on your hands, Fujimori. Bernales, don't do it. Bernales, I will pass your message to the president. We should use our commandos. We could take the building immediately. Are we ready? I need but 48 hours. I should speak to the American Ambassador. We need their advice. [chatter in spanish] These are extra sensitive bugs. You can put one on a pillow and listen to what's going on in the entire room. You give one of these to my wife, I will kill you. [laughter] We have to find a way to sneak these things into the residence. It is Christmas in a few days. The terrorists will allow the Red Cross to bring some medicine, some food, some gifts. We will bug everything. Then do it. It is very important for us to know what is going on inside, minute by minute. [music - "jingle bells"] A little Christmas spirit comes to Peru, Padre. What is this? Christmas care package from the Red Cross. It's about time. And a special one for Ambassador Aoki. Thank you. And look. They even got one for you. Odd. They sent me a fountain pen. I don't need a fountain pen. Let me take a look at that. It's a radio transmitter. Put it away. [music - "silent night"] ALL [SINGING]: --all is bright. Round yon virgin, mother and child. Holy infant, so tender and mild. Sleep in heavenly peace. Sleep in heavenly peace. Silent night. Holy night. All is calm. All is bright. Round yon virgin, mother and child. Holy infant, so tender and mild. Sleep in heavenly-- Ladies and gentlemen, we have received word from Fujimori. Because of Christmas, they have asked for a break in the negotiations. Since the MRTA represents the benevolent government of the people, we will honor that request in the spirit of Christmas. Merry Christmas to all of you. [tango music playing] Miss Phoebe, may I have this dance? How did you know I was a dancer? Dance with him. Make him happy. Delicia, would you like to dance? No, I don't think I can. Of course she can. It's Christmas. Go have some fun. [music playing] Excuse me. I see someone I recognize. Bruce Nelson. Hector! Look who I found. Bruce Nelson. What are you doing here? I believe you're holding me hostage. It's time we had a little talk, Bruce. Let me explain. I was used. [WHEEZING] I'm innocent. Innocent? You turned my anonymous interview over to the Peruvian authorities, and you call yourself innocent? I never gave that interview to anybody in Peru. I showed it to one man, Jeff at the embassy, and he used me. Who the fuck is Jeff, and what are you talking about? Jeff is the press attach to the American Embassy in Lima. I work for him. He's the only one who saw the interview. When I found out the MRTA was planning on breaking into the prison to free you, Hector, of course I told him. It's a great story. I'm a reporter. But he's the only one outside of the camp who knew, so think about it. I'm sure he's CIA. And if he is, then that means the CIA is protecting Fujimori. I don't believe a single word. Delicia, take him to the cellar. If he makes a move, kill him. Mr. Bruce Nelson, you will be the first one I kill when I decide to show Fujimori that I mean business. Mama? Mama. Mama. [inaudible], Padre. How is my wife. She's going to require immediate hospital attention. What shall we do? She's dying! I'm gonna talk to these bastards right now. Mr. Carpa, may I talk to you a moment? Look, you're an intelligent young men. You can't continue treating the people this way. The youngish woman is seriously ill. She could die if she doesn't get to a hospital. Padre, will she make it till tomorrow? With God's help, she might. Mr. Carpa, please help us. Well? In the morning, we will release all the women [inaudible]. I promise. Do you really mean that? Yes. I've made my decision. Thank you. Thank you very much. I must talk to my commander. [door opening] Victor, I must talk to you. Get out. Puta a la Madre did not teach you how to knock on the door? I'll wait outside. Get dressed. You don't want to do it again? Get dressed, I said. Oh, come on, Victor. Get dressed! Get out of here. Close the door. We must release some of the hostages. Many people are getting sick. There is a woman, she has maybe 24 hours left. Are you out of your mind? If we release some of the hostages, it'll pressure the rest of the world to pressure Fujimori into making a gesture of his own. Hector! I am sick of your goodwill gestures. OK, we must calm down. We're both under a lot of pressure. We are fighting for the same cause. You and me, we've grown up since we've been little kids. We sacrificed our family, our lives. Fujimori would love nothing more than for you and I to start killing each other. Give me a hug, brother. OK, brother, you release some of the hostages. I will listen to you this one last time. Just one. Patria o muerte. Attention. Attention! Good morning, everyone. This morning, we will be releasing some of the hostages. Silence! The MRTA wants the world to know that we are not terrorists. What we want is our comrades freed from prison. Those of you who we release will deliver the message that we are not terrorists. We are freedom fighters. Freedom fighters, my ass. What did you say, little man? How many are you going to release? Please, set the sick free first. At least set the women free. We will decide who goes and who stays. The women, the sick, and the foreign ambassadors to the left side. And Peruvians to the right. Move your asses. Please, quickly, everyone. You'll be leaving in a few hours if you move quickly. You must move. Please. Quickly. You know, your selection is a little like the Nazis at the death camp. Shut up, little man, or no one will be released. Now, foreign ambassadors to the left. Please, Peruvian men to the right. Women, the sick, and the ambassadors to be left. Please, move quickly. Go home, Phoebe Pratt. Bye. If you get out of here alive, look me up in Holland. I know where to find you, Miss Phoebe. Padre, thanks for all your help. You should, uh-- you should go. No, my son, I will stay. These people need me. So let me out of here. I'm much more use to you outside than in this rat hole. We are letting the sick people and the women go. You are not sick, and I don't think you are a woman. Read this. What is it? It's my story. Imagine it on the front page of the "New World Times". It's the biggest paper in America. Do you want your story told? Do you want to break the silence or not? You will publish it? I walk out of here, yes, I'll publish it. Otherwise, the only way your story is going to get told is through Fujimori's press geniuses. Delicia, release him. Please. Please move quickly. Please move it. Move. Move. Bye, friend. God bless you. Quickly, before they change their minds. Move. - Careful. Hurry! Hurry! Careful. Careful. Keep going. V monos. - Take care. - V monos. HECTOR: Hopefully you'll see them soon. Miss Pratt, please take this. Thank you, ambassador. - We'll be all right. - You take care. Take care of him. You, too. Goodbye, Ambassador. Yes. Take care, my friend. [music playing] [lively chatter] Ambulance. Ambulance. My wife is sick. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Move [inaudible], ladies. Vamonos. Vamonos And tell the world that we fight for our country's freedom! Bruce! Bruce. Alto! Alto! Alto! Alto. No problema. No problema. What was that for? That was for using me. Because of you, Elena's in prison. You owe it to me to help me get her out. Get in. Get in the car. Where are we going? Presidential Palace. President Fujimori, gentlemen, may I introduce you to Mr. Bruce Nelson? He was just released from the residence today after many days of suffering. Mr. Nelson works for the "New World Times". Sit down, Mr. Nelson. Please tell us your views on this situation. To the best of my knowledge, they're still holding over 70 male hostages. All of them are Peruvian citizens except for the Japanese Ambassador. What do you think we should do, Mr. Nelson? I think you should continue with negotiations. We need a person who has some influence with them. I think I might know that person, Mr. President. Hector Carpa's girlfriend, she's in one of your jails. If you'll let me speak with her, maybe I can convince her to tell Hector Carpa to cooperate. It's an interesting idea. Frantacino. General Frantacino will take you to this girl. Mr. Nelson, you go and talk to her. If she agrees, we will allow her to meet with Hector Carpa. We should use every possible chance to resolve this situation without bloodshed. Sientate. Sientate. Sientate. [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] [music playing] Sientate. Apurese. Who are you? Who do you work for? And you better tell me the truth. Listen, Elena. You have to trust me, OK? I'm doing everything I can to save your life, and Hector's. Hector? Where is Hector? We go. ALL [CHANTING]: Por la vida y la libertad! Por la vida y la libertad! Por la vida y la libertad! Por la vida y la libertad! Por la vida y la libertad! You wait here. Mr. Carpa is expecting us. Vamos. Vamos! Tell Hector Carpa that his girlfriend wants to speak to him. Hector! Hector! Don't shoot! Elena. Elena! Elena. Mi amor. Don't shoot. Mi amor. ALL [CHANTING]: Por la vida y la libertad! Por la vida y la libertad! - What happened? Where's Elena? - She escaped into the embassy. And you just let her? Did you know this was going to happen? Yes. I planned for it. What do you mean? I studied Hector Carpa's profile. He cares nothing about himself, and he is not afraid to die. All he cares about is this woman. So as long as she is with him, we have some small hope that that maniac Victor will not blow up the building with everyone in it. And what if your theory's wrong? Then I have an alternative plan. Let's go! ALL [CHANTING]: Por la vida y la libertad! Por la vida y la libertad! Por la vida y la libertad! It's been 127 days since the MRTA terrorists occupied the residence of the Japanese Ambassador to Peru. Approximately 17 terrorists are still holding about 70 hostages. The crisis has become part of routine life in Lima. Local and international newspapers have already removed the coverage of the crisis from their front pages. So what are you going to do? It can't go on like this forever. I'll surrender. Do you want to surrender? Yes. I've made my decision. I'll contact the American Embassy. They'll notify Fujimori. Then it will be up to him. What about Victor? Will he agree to surrender? He's been taking many drugs lately. So I must make him understand the situation. Be careful. He's in command, don't forget. Do you have the gun that I gave you? Yeah, why? Just in case. I love you. Victor, I need to talk to you. Don't you knock? Ah, this shit again, huh? We'll talk tomorrow. You're too fucking stoned. There will be no tomorrow for you. You want to shoot me? Huh? OK, shoot. Have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately? 'Cause you look like shit, brother. Betray our whole operation, you betray me! What operation? Do you even remember the name of it? The operation's called Breaking the Silence. We broke it. Now the whole world knows who we are. Do you know what they call us? Terrorists. They care nothing of our ideals. We are just terrorists. And they have no sympathy for us. What have we achieved? Did Fujimori release one prisoner from one stinking jail? You and me, we are torturing our people for nothing. We are wrong, Victor. No! We were not wrong, baby brother. We're just trying to make a difference. I love you. I know you didn't mean what you said. You wouldn't have killed any innocent people. I love you, too, brother. So what's with the TV van? What's happening inside of there? Nothing, Bruce. What are you doing here? What do you mean what am I doing here? Every journalist in Peru is here. You planning something? Are you going to raid the embassy? I don't know. [cheering] I just spoke with the American Embassy. They've accepted the proposal. Safe passage to Cuba for everyone, including you. I love you. Watch the guns, huh? Amigos! [lively chatter] 2-0 for the good guys, 0, Fujimori. Hello. Hello. This is Ambassador Aoki. General Frantacino, it's the ambassador. Yes, we read you loud and clear, Ambassador. What is happening? It's siesta time. And now the terrorists are playing soccer in the middle of the room. Now the hostages are sitting around, watching the game. Get the hostages down to the floor. I hear you. I will get the hostages down on the floor. They are ready, My President. Let's do it. Frantacino. Remember, no press. Yes, My President. [music playing] Let's get down on the floor. Down on the floor. Get down on the floor. Why? Don't ask questions. Get down. [lively chatter in spanish] [inaudible]. Get down on the floor. Delicia. Padre, you have to get down on the floor. Do you know something? Just get down. Don't ask questions. [lively chatter in spanish] [grunting] What's going on? They know something. Hector! Hector, look at them. They're on the floor. Hector, they lied to you! We're ready here, My President. They know something. Look at them on the floor. Hector, damn it, they lied to you! Mr. President, your decision. What's happening, Jeff? We'll soon see. Is there anything you can do to stop it? I'm afraid not. Hector, they're going to raid the building any minute! Hector, damn it, they're coming in here! Now! [music playing] Hector! Oh God, Hector. [gasps] Oh, my God. Elena! Elena! No! BRUCE: Elena! Please don't let your daughter go to the jungle. She was only a child. [sirens blaring distantly] REPORTER: Your Excellency, what would you like to say about what happened? That young girl-- V monos. REPORTER: What are you planning to do now? I'm going back home to Japan to be with my family, especially my daughter. REPORTER: I'm with GNN news. Do you have anything to tell the public? You, sir? You, sir? [MUSIC - MARC TANNER, "LET OUR FREEDOM BEGIN"] [SINGING] I see a light coming out of the dark, writing its name on the wind.
