Departure to Caracas, Air France Flight 3776 is boarding immediately at Gate 4. Sir. Your flight is ready for boarding. Good bye, Sir. Bon voyage. There? No, continue. To the right, over there. But... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Excuse me. - I'm so sorry. - It doesn't matter. I'm really sorry. - Place St. Michel, here you are. - We are there, my dear. - You've seen the cafe too? - It's over there. So why don't you pay me then? We're in France. No dollars! I have nothing else. May I? - You just arrived from abroad? - No, I'm on my way to Caracas. Here you are. You don't look very well. I thought it wasn't that obvious from the outside, but usually in such situations in old novels, a priest... would be consulted. A stranger, if possible. I'll write you a check. But no, it's really not necessary. But we can't leave each other like this. Look. Superman! I wonder what I'm doing in a cafe with a man I don't even know. That's it? That's it. Yes, please? 2 white coffees. Now we have a reason to sit here. - I'm waiting for my check. - Oh. Yes. Sorry. - One hundred and... - 10. - Which name? "To bearer" will be fine. I'd like to know your name. Maybe for later. Towarski. Lydia. - Towarski. To... - With "w". With "w". Lydia. Excuse me. Ma'am. Sir... I am a dog trainer and I have a feeling... - Las Vegas! 1975. - You made the... - No... - I was bartender at the Tropicana. - Exactly. Now I remember. My card... You know how it is. When you travel so much you end up not recognising anybody. We're going now. Were you really a bartender in Las Vegas, huh? No. But he really needed to know someone, this man. When you notice a stranger's loneliness so easily... Let's not get too familiar, ma'am. I say ma'am so you can see... that I respect a certain distance. As you can see I don't over-value... the importance of 2 white coffees. - Nice to see you can be funny. I like to make you laugh. It makes me feel better. That's generous. Your friend will soon no longer need anybody. Cut it out! One might believe you also know the signs of despair. I've studied them a little. I lost my little daughter and my husband 6 months ago in a car accident. Well, I think we can leave now. Cheer up, everything will be fine again. When I come back to France I'd like to... if I may. Yes, of course. - Are you going far? - Caracas. Right, of course. Here. - Is it with tip? - Yes, it's included. Nothing. So I recognize you next time. You should rather go home and sleep. Call me, one of these days. Excuse me Sir, but I have a feeling that we... - Sir, come please! - Is he a friend of yours? No, I confused him with someone else. But he recognized me. May I offer you a little moral encouragement? - I wanted to suggest the same. - Waiter! I perform with my dog show at Clapsy's. You should see it. But hurry up. I'm leaving to Mexico tomorrow. My show is world famous. A lifetime achievement. Only that constant trouble with the insurance companies. There... three small infarcts. Smirt. Pardon? Smirt. It means death in Serbian. The Slavs got the best words, the sound fits best with the meaning. Smirt in Serbian, smert in Russian, and smierc in Polish. That sounds like a spitting viper. In the Occident you tend to use more noble sounds for it. La Mort, la muerte, Tot. But... smirt! But back to you. What have you done since Las Vegas? - I've never been to Las Vegas. - Me neither, but it doesn't matter. I was fun to meet you. Come to Clapsy's tonight. We don't meet again every day. Here's my card. - You gave it to me already. - My show starts at 11 PM sharp. Please come. You'll certainly meet common friends. - I can't, I'm flying away very soon. - I want to make a call. - Here's a phone coin. - To where? Caracas. Sir, your bag. She was really charming, the one from earlier. I don't want to be indiscreet but it looked like a separation. - I'm impressed by your sharp eye. - It wasn't so difficult. I met so many women in my life that I was actually always alone. That's how I got the idea for my show. Don't miss it. - I'll definitely visit it. - Unfortunately I'll stop performing. The insurance companies let you down as soon as you need them. Too bad. The only thing that concerns me is my Matto Grosso. - Who? - Him. He doesn't let me out of sight, as if he knew of my problem. - Smirt! - Exactly. He's afraid of being alone. Dogs are timid creatures. Off the record: Maybe he'll die before me. He's already 14. - How long did you have him? - 13 years. He's from an old love. - She disappeared with an acrobat. - The bag! Women have a heart for beginners. She left Matto Grosso... so I wasn't alone. He doesn't belong to the team. He's my friend. - I've got 8 poodles and a chimpanzee. Too bad you have to leave. - Taxi! - See you soon! I enjoyed meeting you again. - You're welcome. Goodbye! - Here's my card. - I have it already. When you're desperate you mess up everything, you know. - Enjoy Mexico. - Caracas! - What shall I do with dollars? - It's all I have. I expected something like this. Well, come in. You look like someone who's been interrogated by the police all night. And, unfortunately, I had no alibi. It's certainly not this but it doesn't matter, you're... - Exactly. And I can't even lose them. I'll have to endure one more night. I've confessed something to you today. And you take the first chance you got. As you can see I don't feel good me neither. Do you remember my old friend from Las Vegas with his poodle? His name is Senor Galba. He collects heart attacks. And he worries about his dog. He doesn't want he's left alone. The dog doesn't let him out of sight, as if he knew. And Senor Galba drinks himself to death, while the dog looks at him tirelessly. I thought it might interest you. You don't have a dog? Don't worry, this isn't an application. My luck. I wouldn't know where to put you. You'd take too much space. Your smile says you've been happy for a long time. In Serbia, they call it "Smirt" It's means almost the same as your Indian Flute. Senor Galba revealed that to me. Now that you know everything, I can go. No, I'm not drunk. And I love a woman, as one can love a woman sometimes. - I think you know that, despite your youth. - I'm 45. We exaggerate always. You do like it's over, listen to a suffocating flute, you live alone to prove yourself you can, but you look at a stranger as if it is still possible. I'm not here to beg. What is still some kind of begging. - I hope we'll meet again anyway. - So do I. Do you wonder if there are survivors in this shipwreck? I don't, but maybe I'll read it in the newspapers tomorrow. Although you don't look like a crook. I should have insisted. Perhaps she'd given me something. Montreal is also full, sir. There's another one tomorrow at 8:30am and if... - Yaounde? - That's in Africa. No. But via Rio de Janeiro there's a flight to Colombia at midnight. - There you'll have a connection. - No, midnight's too late. Yaounde. Air France flight No 144 to Calcutta starts boarding now. Do I have time to catch that flight, to Calcutta? - We can't issue a ticket anymore. - I have my ticket already. - Is it for Calcutta? - No, Caracas. I missed the flight this afternoon. We'll see what we can do, sir. It'll take a few minutes only. May I...? Michel Folin. Write down the number. Call Air France. Michel Folin, have you got anything? It looks like an escape. - Hey, what are you doing here? You're leaving? - Yes, on vacation. Have you sold a ticket on the name Michel Folin? A six months vacation? Damn it! And your wife? - I'm going alone. - Oh, but not for 6 months? And longer if we hold out. Shorter if not. Janique accepted all that? It was her idea. I envy you both. My wife and me... Really, I envy you. We wouldn't hold out one month separated. On our last weekend together I watched you all the time. And I tried to explain to my wife... Oh damn! Your marriage rests on a truly intelligent foundation. Give her a hug from me. I'm really impressed. Person not reported. No entries available. Have a nice trip. - Where're you going actually? - Caracas. Bon voyage! You still want to go to Yaounde, sir? Yes, Yaounde. 15, Rue de St Louis. 5th floor to the left. We aren't so advanced yet! The French want to go everywhere by car. But it's not possible yet. You are wrong. You won't find anything here. Not even a lifeline. Please. Fine. I don't know why I do this. A small suicide. That's it probably. Please don't blame me, but sometimes... I've no desire to be happy. Who's talking about happiness, Lydia? We just practised mutual aid. As you can see, I'm not good at anything. Of course, if you do it as if you'd jump from the 5th floor. When did it happen? 6 months ago. But it never ends. I wonder, if I don't make it even longer... just to have a reason to live through the memories. Otherwise I wouldn't know what to do here yet. Witnesses saw my husband losing control of his car. - Did he drive fast? - No. He had even placed the girl in the back seat. Maybe it was already over, between us, and I needed that excuse to condemn him. In such a case you should go far away. Caracas? Caracas? That would be much too far. As you said earlier in the cafe, you also have to return. Would you like a drink? - One last glass? - Chin Chin. - Is it long ago? - What do you mean? That you lost a woman. Almost a century. What are you doing here? - Mr. Galba? - You're the vet? Straight ahead. Mr. Galba please? You're the vet? The human hand. Colour-rinse and everything's pink. - But it doesn't work for everything. - I'm not the vet. They say so. He's waiting for you. How was Caracas? I promise I'll take care of your doggy. Why? You think it will happen tonight? No. I just wanted to soothe you. I must say I'm amazed. You come here and say "I'll take care of your doggy." As if you knew exactly that I'm going to perish tonight. Did you meet anybody in the corridor? Listen Galba, I promised I'll take care of the dog, so you can die in peace. You're kidding. Do you know anyone who died in peace? It may happen while you sleep. That's perhaps the best way. Damn. That's what I needed. Now I won't sleep a wink anymore. But Matto Grosso is a good guard dog. He'd certainly bark. I'm very moved that you've cancelled your flight, to come and say hello. That's real friendship. I just while the time away. While you want kill it, at any cost. May I? And with you I shall leave my dog and be relaxed? You know Sven Svenson? My assistant. He's a student of philosophy He's writing an essay about my life and work. We met already. A colour-rinse and everything's pink. Out. Not yet back. She doesn't want to take the phone. You know, Matto Grosso and I have enormous experience in marital problems. Either you've got problems or you're a couple, Mr. Matto Grosso. She doesn't take the phone, and that's the problem? We've never had marital problems. There are bad moments, that's all. Misunderstandings. We're doomed to transmit messages to each other that never arrive. You should see my show, my lifework. An exemplary misunderstanding. A bottle thrown into the ocean, but today there's no ocean anymore. There are only bottles. I wanted to tell you that the state of confusion is that serious that all decisions end up in opposite actions and that I owe you an explanation. Don't you know anyone in Paris? You can't go on being alone and listen to that breathless Indian flute. In the Andes, it's bearable. At 5000 m you don't inhale anymore, only exhale. But at Ile Saint-Louis... When you don't know each other well everything seems possible. You know, I'm not talking about love, only about mutual aid. Listen Michel, Michel's your name, right? Yes I'm Michel. I bumped you when I got out of the taxi. You remember? You're are drunk from misery. What are you doing now? I promised to go far away, to avoid being tempted to go back home. But I didn't manage. I'm what you call a weakling. And when a weakling loves a woman it pesters him that much, that when he's forced to leave for some awful technical reasons... I tell you that for us weaklings, separations that we didn't want, tend to end up in alarming amounts of unexpected tenderness. I think you are a strong woman, ma'am, and I apologize. See, I say ma'am to make clear we're still strangers. Where're you? At Clapsy's. In Galba's wardrobe. The man with the insurance troubles. Wait at the bar. I'm coming. Damn it! Jackson is the greatest chimpanzee in our Christian era. Aren't you alright, sir? - It'll be better when it's over. - Mr. Galba says it's his lifework. It's unspeakably horrible. Mockery, humiliation, existence or non-existence. Isn't it awful enough yet? I've seen chimpanzees and poodles, but this... It's the best dog show I've seen in my whole fucking life. Are you Belgian? Not at all! What an idea. Why did he paint that poor poodle pink? - Oh, the rose-coloured glasses! People need a bit of optimism... and vice versa. This show is just terrific! You can get a Belgian colourised as a Japanese and vice versa. You can improve anything. Virtually there are no limits. After that comes a contortionist. He's squeezed into such a hat box. Well, alive. Do you have a phone coin, please? - What is it? - It's me. Michel. You nasty jerk... It's 6 months ago! Can't you even let a friend wait a while anymore? At this hour? Can't it wait until tomorrow? Or... is it serious? - Monique's fine. - Very well. What's going on? She always complained because I say so little. She said words help to bail us out. I'm down, Jean-Louis. - Who is it? - Michel. What's going on? Why don't you come here. What's going on? A black monkey's dancing with a pink poodle. They call it a circus show. - What are you talking about? - Nothing. We're all expected to do the impossible. There's even a guy who squeezes himself into a hat box. Everyone is a masterpiece on two legs. - You're drunk! - I wouldn't mind. - But I can't unfortunately. - Do you come here, or I come to you? No, I just called to while the time away. It should be over soon. - Maybe it's already over. - Are you alone? - No, I'm expecting a friend. - How's Janique? - We're separated. - That's not true! - You're kidding! - Ask what has happened. She left me this evening. That's why I called you. I had to tell someone. Unbelievable! It's just an argument, that happens to all of us. No, it's definite. She's leaving. - We'll never meet again. - Hello! Are you there, Michel? Yes, I'm here. We could simply find no other solution. We had a long talk in peace. It was unbearable. So we decided to end it all at once. No agony, no endless suffering. And for her yet a little female vanity. No, no dignity. Of course, we could have carried on for a while. Steal a few more weeks, striving until the last limit. But you know her... She's a proud woman. And so we've decided that I'd leave for... for Caracas. And she'd go away gently on her own. - Want a picture of me? - Hello Michel, are you there? I never thought it could end like this. Excuse me for asking but... is there someone else? Someone else? What you mean. Not at all, no. I admit I'm not a believer but... But there must be an evil creature, a demon that pursues us, barbaric and pitiless. Don't torment yourself! - I just asked. Is there someone? - Sorry, I don't know what you mean. - Pardon I woke you up, I'm confused. - Sure, have a word with Monique? No. I'm flying very soon... Maybe with a friend. Janique wanted it that way. All alone. She leaves you, but doesn't want you're alone. She knows I can't live without her. - It's her way of being there. - By replacing herself? - I'll never understand women. - No kidding, Jean-Louis! They're the only meaningful thing this cruel life has created. - I wanted to tell you that Janique... - She'll come back. Okay. She'll come back. See, Monique is right when she says words bail us out. They're like balloons, helping us to float to the surface. She'll definitely come back. Michel? But she won't be the same anymore. She'll have a different figure, a different life and other problems. - So long, dear friend. - Michel! So kind of you to call me. When a woman is listening to music alone one should take care of her. Oh, I love confidences. There's nothing more disgusting than a drunk bartender. Champagne! - Lydia, Mr. Galba. - We met already. I only drink at work... Well, he's a good guy. Come to my dressing room. I'd like your company. - The dogs, I wait for the vet. - You should euthanize that poor dog. You'd do him a favour. He's tired of waiting for you! When you got sick on stage he pissed out of fear. Oh no! The cops! I've got a '38 special by the cashier. Shall I get it? - Is there a second exit? - Come to my dressing room. Jacques. Robert! Well, well! Master Michel! Didn't you want to travel away? I'm trying, I'm trying. - And Janique? Is she also here? - You are still my guests. I'll be waiting. I am starting a new life. Friends, a friend. - And how's business, Robert? - Good. - How's Suzette and the children? - Well, well. I look at you and an immortal saying comes to my mind. A single character is missing and the world is overpopulated. - Extincted! - Right. See you. - How much time do you have to while away? - 6, 7 hours. The housekeeper comes at 8am. She's got a key. - You don't have one? I've left it in the apartment to not get tempted, and return. At 8 am we'll buy huge bouquets, and go there, face the neighbours, the doctors, the policemen... You can't stop thinking about her. All you want from me is that I help you, to come through, to pass the night. You just needed a woman, and fate chose me. We've got seven hours of freedom. We can do a lot of things. Return to Mr.. Galba. Make love... The role of a woman for you is only to help the man survive. I don't have that ability. But still you're here. - Are you coming along? - No thanks. - I'm in a bad mood. - Excuse me. - No problem. - It's so common here. - Oh yes? - Were you at Clapsy's? - Is the dog show ready? - Yes. Did you want to see it? No, I keep him with company between two appearances. He's afraid to die. He needs someone around all the time. - I don't understand it but okay. - Mexican superstition. Oh, I didn't know that. Death waits that you're alone before he comes in. And that's Mexican? Indian. Zapotec Indian, from the area San Cristobal de las Culas. - Beautiful country. - Is he Mexican? I don't think so. You pick up a little hope here and there. I see. Excuse me once more. - No problem. - Good evening. We should spend our time in a more respectable area. You talked about mutual aid. I accept your offer. Between us is impossibility, but we can share it. I love a man whom I stopped to love. Therefore I try to love him even more. I'll show it to you in close-up. - I don't ask that much. - I don't care what you ask or not ask. Now it's me! Apocalypse is not just your business. I'll introduce you to my husband. I don't like to be involved. Alright, my dear, I just show you how it is with other people. So you take yourself less serious. You said your husband is dead. You told me on the phone you owe me an explanation. I owe you one too. After all, you slept with me. And I came when you called me. You see I'm trying. I'm also trying. I don't know why I should look deep into your husband's eyes at this late hour. You'll feel better afterwards. Well. Here we are. Maybe you think I'm cruel but it's high time that we get to know each other. - Good evening, Nikolai. - Good evening, ma'am. Sir. Lydetschka, how lucky I am! Lydia, my sweet, my sweet... We were worried and tried to call you. I was afraid you wouldn't come. Good evening, Sonia. Michel, a friend. Madame Towarski, my mother in law. A friend of Lydia... How glad I am. We met in Caracas. - Sonia, I warn you, he's quite drunk. - But he needs it! You must drink to be happy! In Russia we say, your glass must always be full. What? He speaks Russian? Is he Russian? I knew immediately, between us is a little radnoi. - What for a thing? Radnoi! That thing only we have. Is he Russian, Lydia? Shit! Michel, and what more? Folin. My father was an Irish, my mother's Italian. Our name was O'Faolain. But since I was born in France it was adjusted. There are almost no Russians left in Paris. Ln '43 they were all deported. In the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup. My husband didn't come back. Sweet of you to take him along. You both will be very happy. That is enough. I've stolen your son, I know. But God gave him back to you. You were lucky, concerning me and at all. How dare you talk like that, Lydia? Too bad. We're almost Jews, you know. - I'm delighted. - Don't talk like that. God is good. He looks into our hearts. She is very unhappy. Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm here incognito. My bag! Finally! You forgot something. Good. Come. I want you to meet my friends. It's my son's birthday. I'm so happy that you both are here. My mother in law is still very Russian. My family is from Tbilisi. We were very important there. - The Bolsheviks took everything. - It was just like this. - Lydia my sweet! I'm glad. - This is a friend of Lydia. - Marc, this is a friend of Lydia. - Glad to meet you. How are you! Any news from Nikola? It's getting more difficult all the time. He has changed a lot. That profession is impossible. - I won't talk about myself. - Things are changing so fast. I know exactly, but continuity will have the last word. - Everything else will pass. - Sure. - What are you doing by the way? - I wait until it's over. - Times are difficult for real talents. - It will get better again. Let's hope so. Art is used to wait. - Do you know Senor Galba? - Galba, Galba... Is he abstract? No, figurative. He's got a personal vision of life and death, quite cruel, almost brutal. I dislike art that hits you in the face. I hate everything that kills sensitivity. I don't agree. To kill sensitivity can be necessary in order to survive. - Sacha, do you know Michelka? - I don't know. But we have common interests. Poor Sacha. Since the death of his wife he is a little odd. - Have you known Lydia for a long time? - Oh yes, since always. - I'm so happy. - Why's that Madam? Please call me Sonia. Why are you happy, Sonia? I don't want to be indiscreet but I'm curious for the reason. - You were gone for 3 months, Lydia. - Maybe she has new friends. - Ah! You know each other. - Yes, of course. - How was your journey, Pierre? - Nice, I'll tell you. - Will you come to us also. - With the greatest pleasure! May I introduce our friend Klaus. The German embassy official. - From the West! - I hope Sonia will also come. - She hasn't been out for a long time. - I hope so anyway. - I can't find Mr.. Towarski. - Is that a joke? Sir! Mrs. Towarski is waiting for you. - Are you also Russian? - No Portuguese. - I'd appreciate if you'd come. - You'll come, won't you? Well, Michael, do you feel a little less alone? - Did Sonia tell you I have no heart? - Your smile is quite adamant. I'm tired of this here. I don't know what I'd done if I hadn't met you. It's not my way to live. It's a very common way to live. - I wish I hadn't brought you here. - Why not? It passes time. I had promised to come. Sonia is a strong-willed lady. She has decided to swallow everything. With enthusiasm. Because God is serving the meal. And she'll slowly become happy. We've been strangers for a long time. So came the moment where even that was a victory. Maybe I'll go away with you tomorrow, if you really want it. When you meet my husband, you'll know why I fell for you. - You fell for me? You? - Yes I do. When you bumped into me and we looked at each other. When you're desperate enough, you're ready to believe in anything. You seemed so tormented, stressed, weak, powerless. Yes, an easy pray. I gave you my name, my address, went home, fell on my bed and cried. And listened to the Indian flute. And waiting for you, "he'll call me". "He'll be right there. I want him to come." Like when I was 17. You came, but I got panic. - Where's the toilet? - Over there. - Princess Kulapupow. - It doesn't matter. - You were seized by panic and... - By the impossibility. I'm a respectable girl. With principles. So I threw you out. Luckily, you were really at the end and came back. I slept with you. Awkwardly. Since the death of my daughter I feel that I have no right to life. - Oh I forgot that you... - Me too. It is okay. Janique wanted me far away and now I'm even further away than Caracas. They play very good, right? They are Germans from the East. They climbed over the wall under machine gun fire. Immigrants like us. He picked them up. But you have nothing to drink! I'd be very happy to see you at my reception at the embassy. Thank you but you're wrong, I'm not a Jew. - So you don't go? - You're from the house also? No, I'm French, I don't know anybody. But I was invited because I'm the director of Lyric Theatre. - Which gentleman is the birthday boy? - I'm also looking for him. What a mish-mash! Appetizer after the dessert! It's Russian, sir. Well, then I don't have a reason to despair. Why? Why may you and not I? We're leaving soon and you still have to solve some issues. Besides, you've drunk enough. My husband tried to jump out of the window again. But a bodyguard saved him. It's a question of ethics. Should the window be open or not? - I may not decide that. - Can't you talk about it with him? Finally you realize that you are among strangers. Good. - I think I'll go now. Come with me. - Lydoschka! - First you want me to come. And now? - It's late. - You said he barely sleeps anymore. - This afternoon he fell slept a little. 20 minutes, the doctor is very pleased. But he's so nervous. - It would be better if... - Is it because of my friend? - He wouldn't even notice? - Mischenka! Funny how you russify the names... We need some fun in order to endure life, Lydoschka. No, not because of dear Mischenka. Alain wants that you're happy. You overdo, Sonia. Everyone knows you're a fabulous woman. I'm not angry, sweetheart. I know how unhappy you are. This is the house of great forgiveness. We forgive God, the Nazi murderers, the Russians, we forgive everyone! My daughter in law is very poor, Michel. She doesn't believe in God. She has nothing to live for. And you? That's an unexpected question. - You're unprepared too? - Yes. You are drunk Mischenka. Very drunk. I asked you to come, Lydia, because my friends would have been shocked otherwise. Here we go again. I've always defended you. You married my son. - How great! - He still loves you. - How can you know that? It's already enough to mention your name for him. He says "Maman" without difficulty. An other time... An other time. Have a little patience sweetheart. He has no more trouble pronouncing words. He's getting better with the letters. The vowels are always in place. There's nothing... There's nothing to eat left. But go home then, the evening's over anyway. A little more patience, sweetheart. Soon he'll know the whole alphabet without problems. God won't forsake us. We forgave him so much. I was younger than you now when the Nazis deported my husband. I need another drink before I become too clear. It's nothing left, sir. - Will you get some? - No more tonight. - Well, did you find him? - Yes. Behind that door. He'll receive us soon. Good evening, Alain. My husband, Alain Towarski. Michel Folin, a friend. Have a seat, please. Small flea bites, makes tack-tack. What do you say, Lydutschka? Alain says whole words already. Coherent. - No thanks, I don't smoke. - Michel! He recites la Fontaine! No, you... Michel, don't! He's just gibbering. Like all of us. More or less. - But his thoughts are clear. - Of course. Well, you can make a new ideology out of this. A new dialectic. - Language liberated from thought. - Enough Michel! Please! Why did you have to show me this? I've got enough at home. - Luckily he doesn't understand us. - How do you know? - His thoughts are clear. - Exactly! But the words are fragmented. Maybe we should also try... Coincidence can produce the most incredible effects. I said exactly. There you go. He flies like this... My wife... My wife was women... Disappear, disappear. Failed. My love Dydia. Dydia, love you... Love! Love! Dydia. Love! You feel better now, Michel, don't you? Not so unique anymore. "But the truth is that the leader of the bandits is not dead, although streams of blood flow out of his chest. So there's no reason to accept misfortune! - You've to make it profane. - The leader is on his knees. The other one has fallen to the ground. Suddenly the man rises up again and..." It's missing the drinks. Yes, they are all consumed, but I saved one bottle. - One should abolish private ownership. - It wouldn't match the house's style. Private ownership causes only misfortune. Long live China! On the fraternity! Let's make an end to the gladiator fights. - Another one? - One more, why? You're young, you've got time to wait. Maybe you even succeed. Miracles happen. The Georgians get 100 years old from only eating yoghurt. Yoghurt, that's it! Youth thinks they're immortal. Normal. I'm waiting for Madame Towarski. She's with her husband. They certainly need to talk a little. Don't be angry on her, Michel. Both of you aren't used to it yet. Everyone wants to be happy nowadays. But we, the old people, have learned. It seems misfortune has become your second nature. - It should be enough now. - No, Lydia hasn't learned it yet. - She refuses. - My goodness! The valley of tears. We're alive in order to suffer. Who said Jews are not Christians? If I ever become happy, I'll go to Lourdes to receive healing. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Take good care of her. What did you tell my son? I was disgusting, I know. But I feel better now. Where is Caracas? They also offered me a job in a charity association for Bangladesh. At which point becomes an unhappy woman a whore? Ask your beloved theatre director. I was awful... but I don't feel better yet. I've tried everything. Oh, yes! - You drive in the wrong direction. - What should I do now? - Turn around or continue until the end. - Bravo! When Alain came out of hospital, we continued to live together. At that time he became mute. They say real love doesn't need words. Totally impossible to communicate. It should actually had made it easier. But it's about cynicism, Michel. It's about death. Nobody admits it but everybody expects the help of others. An illusion. Maybe. - But we both fell for it. - Tell me about her. One day she said "Until here and not a bit further". He wanted to die. You should have helped him. So that I the rest of my life feel guilty in his death... For putting an end to his suffering because I had had enough? Didn't you talk about fraternity... Well ma'am! What does this mean? You just drive as you like? Where do want to go? - It's the fear of arriving somewhere. - Papers! - You said what? - Nothing. You won't understand. Take care, otherwise you'll spend the night at the station. Well, she said "Until here and not a bit further." Yes, yes... And then she talked about you. So cheerful and with such a friendship, a friendship caused by the first glimpse of hope in months. She'd have liked to meet you, to give you a hug before she left. She would have told you, how much we both needed you. Are you aware of how cruel and indifferent you are, to obviously... talk about how much you love another woman. You must be... a very very desperate man. Come on. Proceed! You didn't have the strength to leave Paris. Actually it's a betrayal. You had promised her. She just wanted to save you. Or perhaps she feared if you stayed she wouldn't have the courage. What's the time? 4 am. We left no stone unturned. And that means, we have to build new. In other words, there will never be another woman. Always only her. You already feel friendship for her. How right she was to rely on you. You gave her everything, Michel. It's nothing left for someone else. The more you give in love, the more will remain. I've left a few more years. And I can give them at least. I don't want anything of your life. I've got enough with my own. I've got few things and I demand even less. A little bit of tenderness. Gentleness. That's enough. What you say means nothing less than that you are very demanding. Yes, very. I think we're fighting a lost battle. That's how you can win. See, I've got an answer for everything. Will you accompany me this morning? Smile, then it gets lighter. But then, what? What, Michel? Then it's you. Other men can maybe live somewhere else. Not me. Not me. I can't see a difference. As if nothing has happened. Now I want you to accompany me to my home, Lydia. Alright. And then we'll depart. You have your passport? We'll go on straight to the airport... and we'll have a stop in Mexico. That's Alain. He calls every morning. I won't travel so far with you, Michel. How you can love a woman so passionate, is too much for me. Leave alone. I'll wait for you. And then we'll see. - You aren't yourself now. You are her. - That's calculating, Lydia. I suggest an adventure where we can only lose if we're to careful. I think it's all about fraternity. Yes, fraternity, and also about the desecration of misfortune, in a time when everyone screams of fear while they actually scream out of love. Maybe it's better to stay in Paris. It's more difficult than in a dreamland. And we'll see faster how it goes. But here's this constant ringing. With you, with me. We have to go away, Lydia. Well, then I'll pack my bags now. Hello? Yes? I'd like to talk to Senor Galba. Tell him, it's his friend from Las Vegas. - You're his friend? - He'll understand. Listen. Can you come here, please? Something's wrong with him! The heart? Listen. He wants that I stay with him so he isn't so alone. But I'm afraid. Oh, it's you. I've got your travel bag here. You forgot it in my dressing room. By the way, did you know that Mato Grosso is dead? - No, I haven't read the newspaper. - His heart failed. - Simply "Pluff"! - Smirt? Exactly. Smirt. Can happen to anybody, huh? I was madly attached to him. He was old. He was afraid to stay alone. He preferred to go ahead. But. I feel good. I still have contracts for 2 years. Congrats. But I don't know what I shall do without that dog. Take another one. Well, of course. But a friendship needs time to grow. He used to put his snout on his paws... and looked at me as if I was everything for him. Can you understand that? I have also put my nose on my paws and looked at someone... as if she was the only important thing in my life. I must finish, Galba. I'll get my bag... He died much too early. Although he was so intuitive. He should have sensed that it wasn't my time yet, and that we have the best show in the world. We even trained last night! What can I say? You can't ask much more, right? You leave tomorrow? A beautiful city, Caracas. Come right up to room 57. Yes sure, you'll have time enough until the departure. I don't like to nose around, well, normally not. Please come. I'm waiting here. I won't go anywhere. Listen Galba. My wife died last night. I go see her and come afterwards. - Perfect. But don't get sober! - There's no risk. Do you have a handkerchief? I'll give it back later. I'm sorry you see me in this state. I had no time to change my clothes for 3 days. - You made an observation? - Don't continue like this, Michel. A little more is always possible. There's no record you can't break. Do you want to go by taxi or shall I drive you? It would be very kind if you could accompany me. - Lydia, coco Mon bebe... - Coco Mon galette... Yes, I know. We all know it. It's not your fault. Talk about a mindless accident. You placed the little girl in the back. You were driving slowly. I'm sure that you... you understand a few words. It's getting better. Be brave. No doubt, you'll do it. Tell him that we'll win, because we're the strongest. We'll cure both metastases and gibbering! Oh God! Righteous and merciful God! You can go home. There are no more Spartacus's. They're all used up. - Do you think they'll do? - She'll love them. She asked you to not see her afterwards, didn't she? Not to see her alone. But with you... Where is it? - It's her husband. - And who's she? Hello there! Where're you going? It's terrible, sir! I brought sandwiches for two, I didn't know you were gone. I brought breakfast. She looked... as if she was smiling and seemed calm and relaxed. I asked "is it going better?" When I realised it I wanted to call the doctor but the line was cut. I ran to the lady on the 2nd floor. They came and searched everything. Your keys were lying on the dresser. You knew she would do it, right? Obviously you had planned it together! You had no right to let her do it! Where there's life, there's hope. You know that. Yes. We've lost a battle, but not the war! My brother in law, Mrs. Lydia Towarski. Commissioner Peubec. Are you Mr.. Folin? Did you know that your wife... Of course he knew it! He should have stopped her! He owes her everything. He said it himself! - And that will continue. - She left me enough for... one or two lives. You'll inherit her gods, the apartment in Nice, and her car. Finally you'll own your sports car! Mr.. Folin. If what your brother in law said, is true you're guilty of non assistance to a person in danger. No, the opposite, Commissioner. It was assistance. - He shouldn't have left here alone! - Did your wife know it? Please don't leave yet. It'll take less than a 5 minutes. I warned you, Mr. Folin. You shouldn't have left her alone! Because she knew her disease was terminal, she simply... The doctor warned me explicitly. Is that right, doctor? Tell me rather how it was. Did it... take a long time? - She fell asleep peacefully. - Thank you, Doctor. The protocol will take less than 5 minutes. - Madam, if you'd wait... - I've nothing to hide from Mrs. Towarski. She is also concerned. Your keys. Did you forget them in the apartment, or left them behind? The phone cord was cut, by her or by you? Any connection to the outside world was made impossible. And also from the outside. Don't try so hard, Commissioner. My wife had decided that the limit of suffering and deterioration was reached. So she asked me to help her. To be her accomplice. When we married we promised to support each other. In good and bad times. We had good times for many years. Now we had to face the worst, that's what we did. I've done what was necessary to help her, Commissioner. I think this should be sufficient for your report. Why go away and leave her alone? Because she wanted it. Everything was as she wanted it. I'll testify further details for the investigating judge, if necessary. Did the lady know what would happen? Be brave! Bye, Commissioner. Monsieur Folin. Your wife has left a letter where she confirms everything. You're lucky. She had asked me not to look at her afterwards. Out of female coquetry... You didn't want that death gains more than he takes. You based your hope on it. And it happened, just as you wished. We'll try to be happy, because life needs a purpose. It will be difficult. There will be relapses, loneliness, blunders... I'll never talk to her about you. As I promised you. I'll hide all photos. All the other things you loved. Michel... It was over so quickly. She's already so far away. She's out there, watching. To see what I'm made from. She's concerned, you know? It'll take time. We're still strangers to each other. We're lacking the disorder, the pain, the discovery of our faults, slowly adjusting to our peculiarities. But... Why does he leave? You know that Pavarotti the tenor never looks at his partner, even when he's doing best? Would he still sing if she wasn't there? Let's go. I'm not sure who helped whom last night. I guess we just supported each other. You taught me that nothing is impossible. I don't ask for more. You helped me to be a woman again. But not another Wonder Woman! Here it is. Go and get your travel bag. - Lydia, you... - Go now! I've cried enough! At last. The first emotions. Now we've really started. - Mr.. Galba please? - Room 57, someone is waiting for him already. - Your travel bag. - I've heard the sad news. Dogs should live as long as their masters. Well, the rules are poorly made... - Yes, Smirt! - Yes. It's at least one worry less for Senor Galba. He's quite relieved. - Free at last. - Exactly. However, he can't be without company. That's why he loves these young creatures from the street. They never give you time to get attached. He explained it to me. Once there was a woman he really loved. She left him. - These things leave traces. - Exactly, I'll read your thesis, but right now I just want to get my bag. They've brought the animals to room 57! Mr.. Director! Jackson! Could you please turn of the radio. I already hear music! After all, I'm not a smoker, not a drinker. So with a bit of training every day, there's no reason, that it shouldn't last for some time. 10, 15, 20 years... for sure... You know that average life expectancy has increased by 7 years? - Am I driving too fast for you? - No no, I didn't mean that. It was just an optimistic note. Generally speaking. Well, bugger off with your childish nonsense! But yes, you're right. Please come in.. Come in. Ma'am asks you to wait. She'll call. - Would you like two soft-boiled eggs? - No thanks. Ma'am said you should eat and sleep a little. - But where is she? - I don't know. She'll call. - I'll make coffee now. - Thank you. - Michel? - I know, Lydia, I understand. I'm at the airport I'm going away for some time. You're doing right. I heard you praying all night. It's too big for me. I prefer a 3-room apartment for a cathedral. I was so desperate. I had to help someone. I know it's very selfish. Yes. You talked about fraternity, you remember? Of course. It's that thing men and women haven't tried together yet. It's so difficult... it's too heavy for me. I can't bear it. There's nothing to bear anymore. Don't cry. But Michel, it's impossible to live like this. Then you've got a reason to cry. I'm leaving now... I'm leaving because you're drunk with misery and I don't know who you are. Later, when we have found ourselves, we can get to know each other. - With a clear mind. - Yes, that will be less easy. Lydia, go away in peace. Go as far away as you want. Stay away as long as you still doubt. Meet other people. Eventually, enjoy yourself. And don't worry. I'll be there when you get back. It might be a long trip. Stay at my place if you like. No, I'd only raise false hopes. Leave, I'll try to get sober. But not too much. Don't worry about it. Subtitles: TheHugeAnimalFromTheNorth
