I'm trying to find a man, I don't need you telling me what to do. Sylvester, you need to find you something to do. Okay. Hi, what can I get for you? To my girl Tanya, who just so happens to finally gotten a real job making some real money downtown. Thank God! Maybe now you can finally stop dancing. Whoo-hoo! Let me borrow a dollar. Girl, can I please get my first paycheck before you get to begging? I should be asking you for some money, Miss Lawyer. Well, as long as you're not asking me, because the last time I checked, I think you still owe me 30 bucks from the last time we hung out. Jessica, girl, it's like that old saying. Long as I owe you, you'll never go broke! Why do I always feel so broke? I don't know. Probably because I owe you money too. That's a good one! Girl, what's up with you? That guy over there. Do you see him? Well, yeah, he's right in front of us. No. Do you see him? Girl, what are you talking about? I don't know. He looks real familiar. I think he's a killer. A what? Ooh, a killer. Maybe he's got a gun, girls. No. Seriously. I've seen that face on the TV. Wait. I think she right. I think that's the Jackson Strangler. No way. Girls, I think maybe you've had a little too much to drink tonight. First of all, I don't drink. And second of all, I'm calling the police. Mm-mm, no. You can't do that. And why not? Because! If that's the guy we think it is, this guy ain't no joke. They can't find one witness on this guy. They all either come up missing or dead. Then that's a risk I'm just gonna have to take, now isn't it? All right, but don't say I didn't warn you. You never listen. Man, how long we gotta keep making these drop-offs? Till my kids turn 18, goofy. Well, how long is that? Man, why we keep going through this every month? How many kids do I got? 10. From those 10, how many are from my wife? None. Exactly. Man, Pooch, that's a long time. I don't think I could do that many deliveries, man. How about you? You wanna make 'em? - I can do it. - You wanna do 'em? - Yeah. - Go on, get the money from this dude, man, since he don't want to. - You sure? - Man, I got this. Oh, you know what? Fall back, fall back. Check this one out. You don't wanna make the deliveries no more? It's not a problem, you just let me know, all right? We'll take care of everything. 'Cause anything can happen to you, you know. You can get shot on the expressway, come up missing. But at least you gave me a heads up so I can find somebody to replace you. Man, come on... I got this, bro. Come on, Pooch, you would kill me, man? Look, man, we got four days to make these drops. Some of my baby mamas ain't nice. Do me a favor, count the money. It took you long enough. I had to get the rope. What rope? You said get the rope. I didn't say get the rope. I already put 'em in the rug, man. If I was gonna wait for you and the rope, she would have turned like a mummy. All right. Who car is this? Who you think it is? It's that chick, no? She's a nurse. What, you think I change profession overnight? Stop asking these dumb questions. You know what? Hurry up and get her outta here, man. I got a lot of stops to make. Right. Aren't you gonna help me? I already did. I get the bitch, and you dump them. And the trunk is open for you, Cinderella. Hurry up, man. I always get the short end of the stick. You rather be like the chick in the back and be the short end of this knife? Wait a minute... Get the body outta here, dump it in the river. I gotta go. I ain't got all day. Hey! She's not even wrapped up, man! Okay, do it! She heavy! Hey, I need some help! Jesus, man. Gotta do everything myself. You... Man, you didn't even wrap her, man. You want me to put a bow on it? Come on, man. This is your first time? I mean... What's up? He with you? I got him. This guy's certifiable. I can't get him to say a word. Put him in the car, I'll make him talk. So what'd you do with the body? What body? Man, you gonna play stupid? Who said that I was playing? Okay, look, we gonna do this one of two ways, the hard way or my way. You do the picking, but either way, you are gonna lose. I got four witnesses that put you at the scene of the crime. Three. What? Yep. As of right now, you only got three witness. The fourth witness is dead. Say what? Yo, Jacobs! How many witnesses we got in the Jackson case? Well, we had four. They found one of the ladies beaten to death in her closet. Husband came home, put up his jacket, found his old lady hanging there instead. Oh, and get this, they found the same rope around her neck as the others. All signs lead to Dennis. How is that possible? He was in custody yesterday. Well, your guess is as good as mine. Hey, guys, I know people. You really think it's just one of us? I got a team. And as of right now, you only have one body on your watch. Do you wanna make it two? Man, get this animal outta here. Yeah, it's about time I get outta this car. Hey, baby, I'm sorry. I got a big case at work. Yeah, I kind of figured. But you could have called, I've been waiting forever. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Did you order yet? No, I was waiting for you. Oh, okay. Hold on. Okay, I gotta, I gotta take this. Just a second. Hello? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. No, no, you are not going to make that call. Why would you? Look, I'm trying to protect you! And you... Hello? Hello? Look, baby, I-I gotta go. Rain check, okay? Rain check what? You just got here! And now I gotta go. You can't. But I will. I need you! I have to go home to my wife! No, I'm not as happy as a caged bird. Free! Hold on one second. Hold on. Say what? You know how I do. Hm. Yeah, well, look, when the boys are away, and it's just me and my lonesome, trust me, it's gonna be a good night. Girl, they went with my mama to some oldies concert. You know she always trying to put 'em up on the dusties. Yeah. What you mean, "What about Alex?" He's at Bible study. But guess who finally got the nerve? Guess who finally got the nerve to stop? I'm tired. Yeah, well, it's what's best for me and my boys. But I wouldn't have been able to do it without you, girl. You've been my rock. Yeah. I know. What are you doing here? Hey, baby. Hey, babe. Mm. How you doing? How was your day? Bad. All on account of the Jackson Strangler. The Jackson who? Strangler. The guy, it's been all over the news. Oh, I've been swamped. All right, so a guy walks into a bar, picks up random women, two or three hours later, they find 'em strangled. - Wow. - Mm-hmm. And that's not the kicker. This guy's been on the run for three months. No witnesses. Dang, none? Not one. Hmm. Wow. Where's your ring? Huh? Your ring. Ah, it's... I think it's... I-I think my hand got all sweaty at the office, and I took it off, and I just threw it on the desk. The office? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, you, you said you were working in the field today, said you weren't going in the office. - Huh? - Said you weren't going in the office. - Huh? - You said you weren't going in the office. Yes, I did! No, no, you said you weren't going in the office, and that was today 'cause I specifically remember you saying today. No, no, I didn't. Yes, you did. No, I didn't. - You did! - No, I didn't. Look, no, I didn't! I mean, it could have been today, yesterday, could have been last year. What difference does it make? Can I just finish the story? Okay, okay, fine, fine, go ahead. Without being interrupted? Yes, please, do finish. Please finish. Okay. Yes, go ahead. Where was I? Um... No witnesses. No witnesses, right. Up until four ladies come out of a bar and see a woman getting into the car with the suspect. Okay, so you do have some leads? That's good. No, it's bad. Well, no, it's bad because one of the women ended up dead. - What? - Yeah, the woman, husband comes home, opens the closet, she's strangled. So now we're down to three witness. And the funny thing is, this murder has the same MO of a guy we have in custody. Okay, well, but how can he be involved if he's, he's in your custody? I said the exact same thing. Weird. Hello? Hey, Jacobs, what's up? What? Where? Lexington and what? All right. All right, all right, I'm on my way. Babe, I gotta go. What is it? What is it? W-wait, what? - They found another- - Wait, what? They found another body. You said Lexington? Lexington and what? Rashaad, Lexington and what? It's Lexington and Sixth. Sixth? Babe, that's where Valerie and Tanya lives. I know, baby. I know. I'll be back. I don't get it. I was just on the phone with her. What did she sound like? All right, I guess. I mean, she was in a good mood. Her, her kids were away, she was enjoying her time. She was happy to finally be breaking off things with this guy. Really? Yeah. Unfortunately, it didn't go as planned. Wow. Is there anything else you can think of? Look, I just need a moment, all right? I'm Detective Williams. Private Investigator Tony. What do we got? Well, no signs of forced entry, but this is definitely a homicide. Hm. We had blood that we sent to the lab for processing. Vic's in her mid twenties, cute girl. She lives here with her mother. Her mom was out to a concert and came home and found a rope around her daughter's neck. Daughter's name is- - Tanya Griffin. Oh, so you know her? Yeah, um, it's my wife's cousin. Um, Val, her mother, took my wife in when she was a kid after her mother had died, so... They're, they're real close. Oh my gosh, I can't imagine. Wow. Okay, I'm gonna keep a close eye on this case. - Okay. - Okay? And I want you to give my regards to your wife. I will, I will. Okay. We're gonna find out who did this, and when we do, it's not gonna be pretty. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. I gotta get going. Uh, my husband and I are celebrating our 20th anniversary, and I wanna get home quick so I can celebrate the 21st with him too. So, but I'm pretty sure you can handle all this, right? Yeah. Yeah, I got it. Yeah. Okay. Hey, take care of yourself. I will. You too. Okay, thanks. Angie, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? I assumed you weren't gonna tell me. This is not the time or place for this, all right? I will talk to you when we get home. You get- - You want me to go home and wait so someone else in my family can get murdered and you not tell me? Babe, look, listen to me. Now, don't do- Do not call me babe! You are wrong. You knew she was a witness in this case, and you didn't do anything! You didn't do anything! Look... Look... Hey, Val. Oh, auntie. Oh, my baby girl. They took my one and only. Somebody help me. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. We'll get through this. Hey. You know, Val, I wish I could have... You shut it. I looked through her cell phone, and I saw all the text messages that you sent her. What? Oh yeah. Your husband knew that my baby girl was in danger. Oh, but he wanted to play Mr. Columbo. What is she talking about, Rashaad? Via text, and I'll quote, "Don't worry about it. I'll protect you." How dare you try to protect someone, and you can't even protect your own wife. Look, Auntie Val, I- - Only by marriage. Ms. Thomas, we need you to come with us to go over some of the details. Okay. Listen, I don't know what you're gonna do, and I don't know how you're gonna do it, but you better find out who did this to my daughter. Do you understand me? Yes, ma'am. I'll see you at home. Why? Why not? Look, man, now, you hit that one girl, and it's like, "Okay, I'll take that one," but now you messed with my family, man. And why you gonna mess with Tanya? Why are you gonna mess with Tanya? Tanya ain't done nothing to anybody. She, she's a good girl, man. Who? Tanya! Man, I didn't tell them to knock off no Tanya. And let me tell you something, I took a lot of lives off these streets, but Tanya was not one of them. But, uh, I really like the name, maybe I should have. Well, if you didn't do it, who did? If it was my job to find out, I would be the one wearing the badge, now, wouldn't I, my brother? I ain't your brother! It looks like you got a lot of work to do. Jacobs! Take him, man. Here we go again. I took a lot of lives off of these streets, but Tanya was not one of them. Hey, Val, I wish I could've- You shut it. I looked through her cell phone, and I saw all the text messages that you sent her.

It's funny, I could ask you the same thing. Really? Yeah, really. See, I'm surprised to see you here at all. Especially considering you the reason she dead in the first place. See now, when she was with me, she had it made. Nice cars, jewelry, all the money she could ask for. Then when she got with you and joined this church, that's when her life spiraled down, giving all her money to that God. Well, you know what the good book says? It's better to give than to receive, my brother. Yeah, well look where that got her. Pooch, you got it all wrong. When Tanya got with me, her life changed for the better. It was all in God's plan. See, he allowed her to get with a scum like you so when she got with me, she would know what a real man looks like. I got you. You and your goons can leave. Baby. You haven't said anything to me all day, and something's gotta give. I mean, can we talk? No, Tevin Campbell, we cannot. We have nothing to talk about. Oh. Okay, because I thought we would want to catch up, seeing as you haven't talked to me in a week and a half. Why should I? So you can leave the important stuff out? No, so that we can be adults for once. Yeah, right. Coming from the biggest kid I know. Look, I know how much you loved Tanya. Okay? I was just trying to protect you. Protect me? How? You were just trying to protect yourself! Please, explain, how in the world were you protecting me? Okay, this is a very high-profile case. Very high! This isn't some hit-and-run or some pickpocketing fiasco. This man has a 14-person body count! And unless you want to be 15, you need to trust my judgment. Trust? Let's not, let's not even talk about trust right now. Because you and I both know that honesty is not exactly your strong suit now, is it? So this is what this is about, huh? Yes, and you thought it wasn't? No, I thought that I heard that you forgave me. Forgiven, yes. Forgotten? No. No, well, they both sound the same to me. Yeah, right, well, I guess you need to hear a little bit better. Go get your ears checked. And you know, this is not the first time you kept something major from me. And every time I think the last time is the last time, guess who comes out with the remix? You got all those people at that job fooled, but I know you very well, Rashaad. No, no you don't because if you knew me at all, you would know I was a changed man. Changed where? You couldn't change the tire that's on your car if you wanted to. Besides, I have proof of your infidelity. No, you have accusation. And that's exactly what you're gonna have if you keep going like this, nothing. Mm-hmm. You're right. Nothing. That's what we've had for the last 10 years. Ever since you messed it up with that thing from work! And it's not my fault that you haven't been able to fix it. So will you please just leave me alone? Angie. Angie! Ms. Griffin, what exactly brings you in to see us today? Well, the other day at my daughter's funeral- - Um, homegoing. I'm sorry? Um, when believers pass on, we call it a homegoing, not a funeral. The saints, they returned back to the Father. And it is my understanding, although Tanya always went back and forth with God, she got it right in her final moments. Yeah. Oh, whatever. I know you told me that if I ever needed anything, not to be afraid to ask. Oh yes, definitely. We're always here to help, especially for those who were so generous, such as Sister Tanya was to our ministry. Well, when I heard you speak on her giving, I got to thinking about how much she really gives, whether it's her time, her energy, her money. Hmm. I forgot all those countless days she spent up in here serving in the food pantry, the bookstore. Oh yes, and I didn't mention the prison ministry. Oh my goodness, she was such a blessing. Her and Alex used to get up earlier and minister to the imprisoned. Always giving from the heart and never asking for a dime. I'm asking for it. Oh? Yes. I'm here to collect. Um, to collect what? Oh, you know! All the money you owe her. You see, my daughter was not as much a businesswoman as I am. That's why you were able to get over on her, you'll find up until her death. Um, passing. Excuse me? Well, again, believers don't die. According to John 3:16, "In him, we have everlasting life." We don't, um, die, we just pass on. Uh, yeah yeah. Well, yeah, as I said, you'll find, to the exact date, a list of all the days she served at the church. Um... I'm confused. Oh, don't be. Each date is marked to a T I even highlighted a couple for you. Um... Ms. Griffin, I think that we might have some type of misunderstanding. Here at Fellowship Christian Church, we pride ourselves in making sure that each and every one of our people are well taken care of, whether it's financially, physically, and especially spiritually. Oh, well- - Our members are in full understanding that they served in a voluntary basis and that the fruits from their seeds are sewn and manifested in heaven. I do understand. But I'm not a member, my daughter was, even though I begged her not to join and waste her time with all this foolishness, especially with her mother being a proud atheist. Oh yes, that's right. I don't even believe in this so-called God of yours. I don't know, what time is it? - Um, this- - Oh, that's all right, I gotta go. Go ahead, look over those documents. My QuickPay information is right at the bottom there. Oh, and by the way, as long as you get everything paid in full by next week, there'll be no reason for me to get my legal team involved. You have been so kind. Thank you for your time. You have a wonderful day. Mrs. Jones. Yes? Is your husband around? Who are you? I was actually, um, a really good friend of your cousin's, and this is my friend Elaine. We both were. She's a little too nervous to come with me today, though. Um, anyway, we think we know who killed your cousin, and it's not who everyone thinks it is. What do you mean? Listen, I gotta go. Both our numbers are on here. You call me later, and I'll be able to talk to you about it then. Okay? Uh, wait a minute, why didn't you just go to the police? It's really complicated. We know how much you loved your cousin, and we wanted to tell you first. I'm sorry, I gotta go. Listen, I don't know what's going on, but some strange woman just rolled up on me on the street and said that she knows who really killed Tanya. What do you mean who killed Tanya? The Jackson Strangler did it. Are you serious? Yes! Now, to be honest, I thought she was one of your little girlfriend at first, but- See, see, now you're playing around. Stop playing. I'm being serious. Come on! Okay, what exactly is she saying? Did she even mention the Jackson Strangler at all? Well, she says she doesn't even think the Jackson Strangler had anything to do with it. What? Are you serious? That's ridiculous. He had everything to do with it. Who else could it be? That's what the woman said. Okay, someone like her is pretty dangerous by herself. We better put her in witness protection before she ends up dead too. Okay, well, she did give me her number, so I'll text it to you. Yes, text it to me right away. And hey, stay safe out here. These people are crazy. Of course. You never know who's trying to get to you to get to me. Okay. I mean it.

Are you serious? You're immature. All right? I mean, look at how you're acting. Look at, look at you. You barely talk to me. You're not cooking. We're not even intimate anymore at all. You're fussing, y-you're cussing, you're moping around like you're a little baby. Now, if that's not immature, then I don't know what is. It's called a woman that's scorned. No, it's called a woman that's selfish. H-how am I selfish, Rashaad? Because I want my husband all to myself and not sharing him with half of the women in the city? It ain't half! O-oh...

We need to talk, face-to-face. As a matter of fact, I have an idea of what's going on here. I was thinking the same thing. Can you have your husband meet me at the station? Yeah. I'm ready to talk. Okay. Please, have him meet me as soon as possible. Okay. Okay. Goodbye. Rough night? You could say that. So I understand you were the last person to talk to Ms. Griffin. Yes. It wasn't exactly the greatest experience, but, of course, I am one to believe that everything happens for a reason. Yeah, that's what they say. I just wish I understood the reason for this one. Maybe I could have done more. Tell me more. You want the long version or the short version? Well, whatever. I got water, I'm good. Well, Tanya, she always had a thing for married men. Really? Yeah. I don't know if it was, like, obsession or what, but she always talked about it like a fantasy, you know? Then, one day about nine years ago, she put it into action. They met at a club, - Mm. - Had drinks, exchanged numbers, now the rest is in the air. Nine years later, a couple STDs, two kids. So, no divorce? Right. My girl always fell for the okie dokie. He always promised to leave his wife, but he never did. Okay, but what does this have to do with the other night? A lot. You see, she had met this new guy, Alex, a good man. Worked 9-to-5, church guy. They hit it off quickly, and she was finally starting to leave Mr. Married Man alone. Mm-hmm. That night, she had to see him one last time to cut all ties. She had been hinting at telling his wife everything. You know, since she changed her life, she wanted to make everything good. So how did you feel about her dating married guys? I hated it. Ah? I knew she deserved better. She knew she deserved better. Well, did you ever express that to her? Absolutely. Plenty of times, but never really ended too well. Girl, when do you get enough of this? Girl, enough of what? Being that man's secret. Girl, bye. What she doesn't know won't hurt her. But it will eventually hurt you. Girl, I am in love. You do remember what that feels like, right? Or have you been single for so long you forgot? No. I'm waiting on God to send my husband, rather than take someone else's. I'm waiting. You do remember what that feels like, right? What? Waiting. Or have you been easy for too long you forgot? This is why we wear these, to remind ourselves what we're waiting for. Girl, whatever. He's my sons' father. No, he's their mother's trap. And I promise you, if you don't let Christ free you from that snare, the only end will be death. Is that a threat? No. That's a prophecy. And you better take your heed. Your kids don't even know who their daddy is. What do you know? I know enough. Wow. Kids never knew their father? Mm, that's cold-blooded. Yikes. What's wrong? I just... I-I hate guys like that. Sounds like a POI. POI? Person of interest. You think so? I mean, yeah, man cheating on his wife? You know, sounds like highlights from my life. I mean, except for the kids, you know. My wife didn't want 'em, I didn't either. Um, it's a typical case. Guy wants to whack off his side piece just to get a clean slate. Wow. I never thought of that. You don't get paid to think. I do. Do you have a description on this guy? I don't. Wait. What? You said they were together for nine years. Yeah, she was, not me. I never even seen the guy. I wouldn't have even thought he was real if it wasn't for the kids. That's the thing with Tanya. She kept this man top secret. Victoria's Secret classified, if you know what I mean. Hmm. Well, did you ever meet the "nice guy"? Alex? Of course. Every Sunday, we all went to the same church, and... Well, I mean, me and Alex did. And then, one day, he ran into her, and they clicked, and she started coming to church with him. It's kind of funny how it all worked out. Like the Word says, some plant, others water, but God gives the increase. I was planting. Alex was watering. Hey, let me holler at you. Boy, bye. I got a man. First of all, I didn't even ask you that. So what you want? Look at you. You so used to someone trying to take something from you, you're not used to a brother trying to give you something. And what is it that you want to give me? My number. Boy, bye. I do not have time for this. No, no, no, no, I'm, I'm just joking. I'm just joking. I'm just joking. Unless you really want it. See? No, for real though. For real, for real. My church is a couple of blocks up. You should pop in on us one Sunday. No, I'm good. Come on, it'll be good for you. Look, I ain't been to church since I was, like, five. I doubt I got anything to wear. I gotta go. Can I at least get your name? Well, I guess she saw him again, and he kept asking, and one thing led to another, and next thing you know, they were like glue. You never saw one without the other. So, what are we calling this? What? This. Us. What are we, uh, what, are we dating? Nah. See, a real man? A real man don't date. He courts. Oh. Well, then I guess you consider yourself to be a real man then? Well, yeah. Tanya, when you think of a date, you think of the calendar, right? Yeah. Okay, and if there's something on that date that doesn't fit your schedule, what do you do? You try to find one that does. Exactly. You adjust your schedule. Tanya, I don't have to adjust my schedule because I found you. That's deep. No, baby girl, that's favor. Tell me something. What is it that you see in me? Hmm. Honestly? I see a sweet, beautiful, intelligent, and wonderful woman of God. She's laughing at me. What's funny? It's just... That's not what I see when I look at myself in the mirror. Really? No. You see, I see a woman that's broken, torn, not worthy. Plus, I have a past. It's time you forget about the past. You know the story of Hosea and Gomer? I told you I needed to brush up on my Bible. Well, let me enlighten you. You see, um, Gomer knew a lot of men, but Hosea had married her anyway. He accepted her for her. He forgot about her past. When a man loves a woman, I mean truly loves a woman, there's nothing he won't do to be with her and only her. Can I be desperately honest with you? I wouldn't have it any other way. I know we've been talking for a few weeks, and I like you, I really do. I mean, you're really dope, but- - You're seeing someone else, right? Yeah. Tanya, I'm not stupid. So what, you stalking me? Well, not stalking you exactly. But I have seen him around with his wife. You realize that's not who God has for you, right? Look, he says he's gonna leave her. Yeah. And you believe that? Look, all I'm saying is this, pay attention to what's right here in front of you, right now. Okay? All right, well, hey, let's eat. We got a picnic, right? So I assume the two of them still stayed together? Well, yeah. I mean, Poochie had a problem with it. Poochie? Wait, who's Poochie? Granny, I'm hungry. Okay, let's see what they have over here for us, okay? Okay. Thank you, ma'am. Really do appreciate what you're doing for the community here. Yeah, we appreciate it. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you so much. You know, this is exactly what we need in this neighborhood, people that actually care. Not like these low-life that's passing around this poison to our babies. Well, the Lord provides, doesn't he, Mrs. Gunther? Yes, he does. He does more as well. He provides, he guides, and he keeps us. He's a good God. Yes. - That's right. - He's a good God. - That's right. - Amen, yes. All right, y'all keep doing what you're doing, all right? We will. - We will. - All right. Come on, baby. You know what, baby? I'm gonna go inside and see if there's some more juices and water, all right? - All right, baby. - Okay? You good? - I'm good. I'm great. - Fellas, hey, hey, watch your mama. - A'ight. - Watch her. Hey yo, Slim? Slim! Come here. What do you want, Poochie? Man, that's how you greet me? What you want me to call you? My baby daddy? My bad. Were we still keeping that our little secret? Or did your wife finally put two and two together? You know, it's only been, what, nine years? I think it's about time she knows. Don't you think? You better not. Well, why not? You know, you didn't send your drop off guys this month to keep it quiet. I thought that was a sign that you were ready to come clean, dirty. My money been kind of tight. Really? Well, I wonder how tight it's gonna be when your wife finds out about us. You know, them attorney fees can get real hefty. Then when I come forward, it's like a domino effect. All your other baby mamas, gone. Listen here. You ever wonder why they call me Poochie? Hm? 'Cause that's the name of the guy that killed my mama. Real cool, easy-going, 'til you mess with him. Then people end up dead. See, I'm just like him. See, on the streets, they called him Poochie, but at home, we called him Daddy. I got no problem taking my baby mama out either. Boys! Boys! Tanya! What are you doing? Yes, ma'am? Come here. There's somebody I want you to meet. This is Mr. Edwards. He's your mom's good friend. Say hi. What's up? - Hey. - How you doing? Hey, mister. Hm? What do you know, we got the same last name. Nice car. Yeah? Maybe your daddy'll buy one just like it for you one day. Sir, we don't have a daddy. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what'd I tell you about that, huh? Don't ever say you ain't got no daddy. Okay? What'd I tell you? He's just like the devil, right? He's always there, even if you don't see him. Hey, baby! Hey, um, we didn't have any more juice or water, okay? But we got a bunch of chips. Who's this? This is, um, this is him. - Him? - Him. Oh! Him! Okay, okay. How's it going? All right, well, I better get going. So that was the last they heard from Poochie? Not exactly. Alex! Alex! Alex! What is going on? - Alex! - What is going on? Let me in, hurry up! Let me in! Hurry! Baby, baby, what, what? Baby? What is going on? I think he's following me. What? What are you talking about? Who's following you? Poochie! He's trying to kill me. What? Look, I've been, I've been trying to tell him ever since I started over with God. And I've been trying to come clean with this wife, but I gotta tell him first. Tanya, what are you talking about? Alex, I don't know who my sons' father is! L-Listen, first of all, calm down. No one's gonna lay a finger on you as long as I'm around. I'll die first. Come on, come on. Hide me, please. Who is it? You know who it is, man, stop playing. Can I help you? Not unless you work at Popeye's and got two breasts and a thigh from me. Come on, man, I'm looking for my lady. Your lady? Yeah, my lady. I'm sure she told you we had history. You know what it is, come on. Hey, man, you can check this whole house. You're not gonna find her nowhere. I know she in here 'cause I can smell her. Come here, baby. Come on, Slim. Where you at, girl? Hello? Spence, what's up? And this better be good. What? All right, I'm on my way. All right. Man, stay away from us, Poochie. Oh. Man. You heard what I said! You heard me, right? Yeah, you gonna see me again. Yeah, but I'm not so sure you want to see me. Get, get outta my house. Well, looks like it's time for me to pay Mr. Poochie a visit. W-wait, but don't you want me to finish telling you about the married guy? Wait, I thought that was Poochie. Oh no, they're two totally different guys. Remember, I told you she was fascinated with married men. She was running game on both of these guys at the same time. Really? Oh yeah. As a matter of fact, I know I told you I couldn't describe what he looks like, but I do know what he sounds like. Okay. It's actually funny, though, because that's how everything adds up to the night she was murdered. I heard his voice too. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yep. I was talking to Tanya when he walked in, and then she dropped the phone in shock when she saw him. The thing is, the phone never hung up. Yeah. What are you doing here? You know exactly what I'm doing here. You think I'm just gonna let you, quote, unquote, "lay it all out on the table"? Tell my wife about me and you and let you get away with it? No, no, no, you know I'm smarter than that. Shut up! Save it for the birds. Yo. What's going on? My man, you're right on time. Hm. Hey, baby, tell Marvin Gaye what's going on. Baby? Oh, what, you didn't know? Baby girl's been playing both of us, dog. No, no, I was playing you. I do not live that life anymore. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I forgot. She all saved now. See, she started dating the choir boy, and she all sanctified. Yeah, but she been playing us, dog. Oh, and by the way, I'm them boys' papi. What is this dude talking about? Dude? Oh, hold on, one second, my name ain't dude. I'm Officer Rashaad. And that might make a difference, but it's not in the next couple minutes 'cause you're gonna be dead. But, long story short, I've been giving her the loving, and she's been getting the money from you. I mean, I liked that deal, honestly, but all good things must come to an end. Yeah, like you. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey now, wait. Hold up. Hold up. Don't do anything stupid. So lemme get this straight. You invited me over here so that you can tell me that the kids that I've been paying for you to keep quiet from my wife aren't even mine? And you thought I'd be okay with that? I tried to tell you, Poochie. You owe me $300,532.23. Wow, that's a lot of money. Now, I thought you said you didn't love this dude. Wait, what? Mm-hmm. I never said that. Don't listen to him, Rashaad. Those words never came out of my mouth. Yeah, you remember, that night at the club. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait a minute. - Yeah. - What? No. I said I didn't love you... I didn't love you like that, I-I wasn't in love with you, not that I didn't love you. Oh. Okay, so let me get this straight. You've been lying to him about me then lying to me about how you feel about me. It's not like that. It's just, it's just a big misunderstanding. No, no no, it ain't. I think I understand everything perfectly. Now we're alone. Come here, I wanna tell you something. No... No, I just wanna talk to you. - Rashaad, I'm sorry. - No, no, no. Come here! Rashaad! Rashaad! Rashaad, please please please! Well, it seems like you solved this whole thing just by hearing my voice on the phone. That, and you introduced yourself to Poochie when he walked in. Mm. Dead giveaway. I know you tried hard to put this on the Jackson Strangler, but what's done in the dark always comes to light. Yeah, always does. Guess I'm gonna just have to kill you. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Breaking news. We've just been told by authorities that they have taken into custody one of their own, a 22-year police veteran. Rashaad Williams was arrested for the death of Tanya Griffin, who was found dead in her apartment that she shared with her mother and two children. We need to talk, face-to-face. So how long have you known about this? Girl, let's start with forever. Wait a minute, why didn't you just go to the police? It's really complicated. I wanted to look out for my girl because I knew they were dating. We know how much you loved your cousin, and we wanted to tell you first. And I wanted to prove to her that there were other women besides you and her. It just so happens she didn't get the chance to see them. Guess they were meant for you. Williams is also linked to the murder of one of Tanya's best friends, 46-year-old Jessica Turner. More news at 10:00. Hey, listen, I hate that you had to find out about your husband and your cousin this way. No, no, look, I would've found out eventually. I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to prove all of this. Oh, trust me, I have the perfect setup. I see y'all got him. Whoo! I'm so glad.
