There's only one man in my life who has ever made me happy. One. George, of course. George, my husband. George, who is out somewhere in the dark. George, who's good to me and whom I revile. George, who understands me and whom I push off. George, who can make me laugh, and I choke it back in my throat. George, who can hold me at night, so that it's warm - and whom I bite so there's blood. George, who learns the games we play as quickly as I change the rules. George, who can make me happy, and I do not wish to be happy. Yes, I do wish to be happy. George and Martha. Sad, sad, sad. The bow. You're in the way, sweetie. Move. Where's the red lipstick? Please leave it out. It's right here. Please leave the red lipstick out, so I don't have to look for it. It was right there. Haven't they fired you yet? You can order a beer if you like. It's not like I can't be around alcohol. I don't feel like one. - I should be so lucky. Are you done now? It's really irritating. This is a private conversation. You could at least ask me first. Why won't you tell me how it was? - The stay? It was great. Really? - No. Please, I asked you not to. I'll take a picture, and that's it, okay? Here. I hate ordinary people. No, they're great. They have great taste in politics. They're great. So now what? Yes, now what? How are you? I really need to see the boys. - Okay. I know I said I couldn't cope with them, and I have done things. I understand if you're skeptical, but I have changed, Christian. I really need to see them. I miss them like crazy. I said okay. Alright? I've thought about it, and it would do us all good. Seriously? - Yes. Don't bother thanking me. - I wouldn't dream of it. My name is Michael, and I'm an alcoholic. As you may have noticed, I haven't been here lately. I know it sucks, but I'm not doing very well. Sometimes... I don't know. I feel like a jerk. Then I go to downtown - and cash some money and sit and look at the bar I usually end up in - after one of my binges. I just sit and look at it. And fight the urge. It's like I'm losing my grip, and I can't remember the feeling - of being in the right place at the right time. I had that feeling after rehab many years ago. I can't find the strength... Yes. - There we go. The house is packed again tonight. Are you nervous? - No, I always drink like this. Is it too tight? - I'll say. You shouldn't be. You're amazing. You're so sweet. - One of the best in this country. Really...? In the whole country? Here you go. My shoes. - Right. Please spray the room, so it doesn't smell of booze. Come on. - No, that's all. That's all? Martha stops just when the going gets a little rough. Martha's a misunderstood little girl. Not only does she have a husband who's a bog - she has a tiny problem with alcohol. Like she can't get enough. And on top of that, poor girl, she has a father - who doesn't not to give a damn whether she lives or dies. And on top of that, she has a son who used to fight her all the time - who can't stand the braying residue that called itself his mother. His mother. Hah! Sorry, it's instant coffee. - I see. Our espresso machine broke down. - This is fine. Do you have some milk? I ought to give up coffee. It's bad for your digestion. Is it? They should be here by now. Choir practice always drags out. Wait till you hear them. They've really improved. I've never liked it. - The boys' choir? It's sort of like a religious sect. They all look and dress the same. And at puberty, they cut their balls off and throw them in a dungeon. No, I'm glad that they like it. It's great. And what do you do? Fashion? Are you a designer? I'm a psychologist. Seriously? Yes, seriously. - Okay. Don't worry. I don't walk around analyzing everybody. No, I suppose not. What's taking them so long? They probably had a fight... They're a bit on edge lately. Or were killed in a car accident. Just kidding. We're home! - Hi. We're in the kitchen. Sorry. Hi. Won't you come and say hello? And give me a hug? Is it weird? - Go say hi to Mom, boys. Go on. Hey, sweetie. Hey. You too, William. Come and say hello. Come on, sweetie. I know it's a bit weird since it's been so long - but you'll soon get used to it. Okay? Okay? - Yes. That's enough now. That's fine, boys. Hi. Sorry. Hi, Thea. - Hi, Annette. I was thinking of paying my bill. - That's a good idea. Hang on a minute. - Is it huge? It's big enough. See for yourself. Dear. Can I have a mineral water with ice and lemon? Keep the change. - Thanks. Can I help you? Didn't think so. You're awfully lively. - You bring out the best in me. You're really a bastard. I? I? It's perfectly all right for you. You can make your own rules, slashing away at everything in sight. Scarring up half the world, but if somebody else tries it... no sir! You miserable... - I did it all for you. I thought you liked it. It's sort of to your taste. Blood, carnage and all. I thought you'd get all excited and run at me, your melons bobbling. You've really screwed up, George. - For God's sake! I mean it... you really have. You can sit there with the gin running out of your mouth, humiliating me... You can stand it. - No! Yes, you can. You married me for it! Hi, Majken. - Hi, Thea. And here I am. I just wanted to say hi. Do you have a minute? Sure. Is this room free? - Yes. Here. This is for you. - Thea... You shouldn't have. - Yes, I should. Or maybe not. It's a good model. All you have to... Whoops. It's very smart. You just have to pour the milk... And attach this somewhere... Then you pour the milk in, and it does the rest. Very clever. You shouldn't have. - Maybe not, but I wanted to. It's important that we get along. I liked that we connected last time. We had a good talk, I think. Short, but... Yes. - I would've stopped by with it. But I don't have the boys till next week. I didn't want it at my place. And I wanted to emphasize that this is for you. Not Christian. I hope you drove to work. I think I meant what I said. It's too much. I can't accept it. It would mean a lot to me. - I do like it. But I don't think we know each other well enough to... I insist that you keep it. That's... You're... Thanks. It's very nice. Maybe I did go overboard? - No, it's fine. Thanks. It's just... It's important that we get along well. I'm expecting a client, so I have to ask you to leave. Sure. - Aren't you going to take it? Sorry. Thanks. Really... Where are the lions, Dad? - Back there. The animals aren't very active. - No, they're not doing much. Look. There they are. The dear reindeer. - Aren't they cute? They eat white hair. - You're funny, Mom. Sometimes. Sometimes she is. Let's see those lions. Do you know "Old McDonald had a farm"? Mom? When was the last time we went to the zoo? In you go. Thanks very much. I had a great time. Me, too. - It was a lovely day. Let's do it again next week. At your place? Yes. Let's do that. - See you. When can they come home? - Excuse me? I know their home is with you, but when can they come live with me? We could have them a week each. - A week? Is that too long to start with? Would weekends be better? Until they're used to it? What? What's wrong? Listen, Thea. The boys and I are glad to have you back in their lives. But they can't live with you. - I was a different person then. I'm not like that anymore. What if it happens again? - I drink and leave them all alone? You know that won't happen. I've changed. You know how much this means to me. Give me a chance. Please? This is your chance, damn it. Seeing them once in a while. Christian... See you on Friday. - Yes. See you. George! George! Deserted. Abandoned. Left out in the cold. Can I get you a drink, Martha? Why, thank you. That's very kind of you, George. Why I'd do anything for you, Martha. Would you, George? Why I'd do anything for you, too. Would you, Martha? I've misjudged you, Martha. I've misjudged you, too. George. Where is everybody? Jesus! Hi. - Today is Tuesday. I know. - We agreed on Friday. Why are you here, you silly goose? - I was in the neighborhood. Can I get in? - Yup, but don't try anything. Sweet, darling Thea, you can't just sit here. You have to stick to our agreement. - I'm not doing anything. No, I know. - So what's the problem? You know what I mean. - I just rattle around the apartment. I don't have anyone but the boys. I don't see anyone, Christian. Don't be so impatient. This isn't a role, Christian. This is my life. Do you understand? This is my life. All I have is the boys. That's it. I must see them more often. - Go home, please. Just go home. Majken! Thea? - Hi. Do you have a minute? Hi. What are you doing here? - Would you say I'm ready? Ready? - Yes, if you were my psychologist. As a professional. Would you say I'm ready? But I'm not your psychologist. - No, I know, but what if...? With the things you know about me? As a professional? Am I ready? Psychologists can't work with clients they know personally. Okay. I see. It's just because Christian... He doesn't get it. I know he means well, but... I am well now, but it's like he won't accept it. He says you're anxious to see the boys. I completely understand. It must be hard. - It is. And I am ready. Don't I have a right to see them? - Of course. You're their mother. Precisely. Exactly. Thea, take a deep breath. - I am... Or I'm trying, but I can't. When I was a kid, I also wanted to be a psychologist. Breathe, Thea. I can't. No, bullshit. That's a lie. I was just trying to be polite. You're very sweet. Will you tell him that I'm well enough to see them? I refuse to get involved. Of course. I understand. Don't tell Christian I was here. Please? But I know you will. Take care. Say hi for me. No, don't. Hi. It's the coffee machine. It puts way too much in the cups. Hello. My name is Peter. - Thea. Where is Kirsten? Kirsten? - She was here last time. I don't think we have a Kirsten here. - Last time, we talked to her. I haven't worked here very long, so... But welcome. Yes? You got divorced 18 months ago? - Yes. It's been downhill ever since. Sorry. I have to get used to that it's actually you. You gave up custody of your children voluntarily? Why was that? To be quite honest... I drank like a fish. And how are you doing now? And now I don't drink. But how you are feeling? I can't really say. I feel what I feel. Fine. I don't drink anymore. - I see. Do you feel ready to take care of your children? I hope so. I hope I'm ready. Yes. But if you involve us - things can get ugly. We encourage people to work it out between themselves. I also have to say - that your case doesn't look good. You've been away from them for a long time. Your current situation is unstable. You've been physically violent... ... to the children. Are you sure you want to proceed in this? Is there any other way? - The 2 of you could work it out. We can't. We can't. I've changed, but they can't see that. They? My husband. Ex-husband. He doesn't get it. Okay. Then we'll call him - and the children in for an interview. Together and separately. And then... Then we'll take it from there. What are the odds of getting them back? You're their mother. So you have a strong case. Hello. Is one alone out on the town? No, one isn't. One is waiting for someone. Of course. My name is Tom. - Great. But I'd like to be alone. Yes. - As in by myself. I understand. I'm on a business trip. I live in Berlin. Really? - Yes. 5 years now. How interesting. How about you? - Sorry, was I speaking Chinese? I said I wanted to be alone. Yes. Do me a favor and wipe that smile off your face and fuck off - back to your wonderful wife, kids and family. And leave me the fuck alone. Please? I apologize. I'm really sorry. - Please. Just take a walk. Maybe some other time. I'm sorry. I apologize. I've had a bad day. And I took it out on you. I'm terribly sorry. Hi. My name is Thea. Can I buy you a drink to make up for my bad behavior? No thanks. How can you be so nice about saying no? I don't get it. Who do you think you are? Do you think you can be an asshole, say sorry, and it's okay? You think you know me. I know you. Women who hang out in bars and feel sorry for themselves. Men are just stupid bastards. You know men. Maybe too many men? You looked so cute sitting there. I thought we could have had something. If you were the last woman in town, no thanks. What do you think of skin? - Skin? Our packaging. Human packaging. I don't know. - You have lovely skin. Thank you. Is my skin ugly? - No... Old? Tired? Dog skin. - Your skin is fine. For my age. - Your skin is lovely as it is. That is... for my age. I guess so. What would your boyfriend say if you came home with my skin? I don't have a boyfriend. - But if you did, would he find it odd? Yes, I suppose he would. - Exactly! I look odd. You know... Dog skin. I have an extra face. Extra face. I can move 2 pounds of it back here. We could switch for a day. Then you could have my skin. A whole day? That's very generous. You'd probably stay home all day if you had my skin. That's what I would do. There's something... - Thea, your skin is fine. I know. You have to say that. I look like shit. Ready? - I want a new dresser. Why? - She's a kid. Hire someone who isn't a minor. - Break a leg! When you get through the skin, all 3 layers, through the muscle- - slosh aside the organs, get down to the bone - - you haven't got all the way yet. There's something inside the bone. The marrow! That's what you gotta get at. Yes! But bones are resilient, especially in the young. Now take our son... We have scooters. - I live in an apartment. We have an electronic set of drums. That isn't much fun. - No. Did you say it was for boys? - That's what I said. Police Force. It's new and very popular. No. How about squirt guns? This one is on sale. But it's fall. Right. Perhaps you could... Here we go. A disco heart. It's a lamp. It lights up. And they could have a disco party. How do you play with a disco heart? It revolves and looks nice. I told you that I have boys. Maybe you could look around. No, I'm out of my depth. That's why I want your advice. Are you listening? Please look at me when I'm talking to you. I'm sorry. Today has been crazy... - Crazy? But whatever you buy can be exchanged. I don't want to exchange things. I want things they and I will like. Could you please help me? - I've tried to help. But if you look around... That's not helping! Hi. You guys look so sweet. Hi, Christian. I've made an appointment at the county for all 4 of us. Hi, Christian. Nice to see you. There's something I want to talk to you about. I haven't told you - but I made an appointment at the county for all of us - so we can talk things over and... ... talk things over. It's Friday. - It is. You look good. - Do you remember the apartment? Of course, they do. Have fun. I'll be back in 2 hours. Can't you stay for a while? - No. Can I be alone with them? - You'll be fine. Is something wrong, William? - I want to go with you, Dad. He's a sissy. Stop that. You be good now. It'll be fine. - Listen to your father. They'll be okay in a minute. See you later. - You know what...? No, forget it. See you. Bye. Finally! We got rid of him! Do you want to see your presents? Why don't you take your coats off? Don't you want to open them? Do you want to open this one? And you can open that one. Is it hard? Thanks. Thanks, Mom. - You're welcome. Viking William. Thanks. - Is it too big? Now you can battle. I'm Eric the Red! Attack! I'm the evil one. Die! Gotcha! Goodness, I'm tired. Now I'm Eric the Red again! See you, Mom. - See you, sweetie. See you. Off you go. Thank you. - No problem. I mean it. Thanks very much. It means the world to me. Hands on noses! This is Thea. Hi, Peter. Sorry, Peter who? Right. Hi. Of course, we can. Should all 4 of us come? Okay. Do I need to bring any papers? Or does Christian? No, I see. The children as well. I understand. Fine. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Thank you. You're a monster. I'm loud, and I'm vulgar. And I wear the pants in the house. Because somebody's got to, but I'm not a monster. I am not! You're a spoiled, self- indulgent, dirty-minded, liquor-ridden... It went snap. Look, I'm not going to try to get through to you anymore. There was a second back there, just a second - when maybe we could have cut through all this crap. But that's past. And now I'm not going to try. Once a month. I've gotten used to it... Once a month we get misunderstood Martha. The good-hearted girl underneath the barnacles. The little Miss that the touch of kindness'd bring to bloom again. And I believed it more times than I want to remember. Hi. - Hi, Thea. Could I have a mineral water? - No problem. Here you are. Hi. Grumpy Tom from Berlin. Ilsa, the she wolf of the SS. Are we a bit drunk today? - Yes. I don't know about you, but I'm.... rather drunk. Is it nice? Yes, it is. It's actually fantastic. Can I offer you something? - No, thanks. I feel fine as I am. You don't drink? - No, not anymore. I'll drink to that. What about a dance? Yes, what about it? This is where I live. - Okay. This is where she lives. Ilsa, the she wolf. Are you sure no one else is here? No husband or children? No. You don't have a ferocious dog or cat? No. - Bird or fish? Do you want to come in or not? What's with you, Thea? The county? I thought we'd work it out. I'm trying to help... Hi. What? No, thanks. Can I put my arms around you? Yes. No, you're too small. You're too small for this. What's too small? - What? It doesn't feel... Can I kiss you? - No. No? You're sure? - Yes. I won't ask you again. - No. No. Are you going to keep your coat on? No? You said yes. Take it off. - I want to keep it on. I don't want to take it off. I don't want to do this. I'll take it off. - I don't want it off. I can't do this. I can't do this. - Yes. Ouch. My arm hurt. Your arm? There? Stop it. I can't do this. I don't know how. I don't know how. - Look at this. Ouch. - Aren't you limber? Stop it. I want out. - Out? This is your apartment. Yes. - You're not going anywhere. Stop it! - Come on, honey. Stop it! - Stop it! You little worm, I'm stronger than you. I don't want to do this. This is uncomfortable. Let me go. You can sleep on top of me. I'm too heavy. I'm too heavy. No, it's fine. Take your coat off. Take your coat off. I can't see anything! - Good. Good night! You're scary. You don't recognize me, do you? - Yes. You're Tom. No. - From Berlin. Not from Berlin. We've been together before. We've been together before. Where? - Here. What are you talking about? - Don't you remember? In my apartment? - Yes. Here. We've been together before. - I can't... Finally! And I'm going to howl it out and not give a damn - and I'm going to make the damned biggest explosion you ever heard. Try it. - Is that a threat, George? I'll rip you to pieces. - You aren't man enough. Total war? Yes... Yes. Total. Isn't she coming after all? Thea! Open the door. Open up! - I'm not home. Open up! I can't take it anymore. What can't you take anymore? - I can't go on. Can't go on what? - Helping and giving you a chance. Shut the fuck up. - What? You're a pathetic, little person. - Bravo! Shut up. Stop it! Don't make fun of me. I should make fun of you. You're a pathetic leech that sucks everything out of me. You're a fucking empty shell. You have nothing. And then you make fun of me? You fucking, horny, little nurse. You love this. Go home and clean up your wife's puke when she's drunk. No, right. She's a psychologist. - Shut up. I'm doing this for the boys. You're doing this for yourself. You parasite, you sponger. Fucking idiot. - All you think about is yourself. You don't care about the boys. - Quiet! I don't know them anymore. You turned them into Toys R Us children. Fucking Nazi kids. If it wasn't for this scar, I wouldn't know they were mine. You really need help. - Get out. Get out of here! I said get out! - Forget it. Piss off! - Thea, for Christ's sake. Come here. You need some fucking help. Shut up, you fucking medical secretary. You're the whole fucking health industry. But you can't help others. And you're not allowed to help me. Get out. - Thea, for fuck's sake. Piss off, you fucking prick! (Jeg ved en l?rkerede) Where are we going, Mom? - I have a surprise for you. What about school? I talked to Dad about it. - That's a lie. I know this is strange, but you have to believe what I say. So what are you saying? I'd love to take you for a drive. - Okay. Okay? - Come on, Mathias. Where are we going, Mom? You'll see. - Can't you just tell us? Is this it? Can I go in the water? - Of course. Did you bring our suits? - Yes. I don't want to. It's too cold. - Go sit on the bench. Help yourselves. - I don't like it, Mom. Really? Why? - I just don't. Then it's a good thing I brought apples. Can I have one, too? - After your sandwich. Dad says you're crazy. - Yes, I am. I'm crazy. You're the lucky children of a crazy mother. That's cool, isn't it? Yes. Is your new mom nice? - Yes. Not as nice as you are. I love you guys. - I love you, too. I love you very much. I love my whole family very much. If I didn't, I'd be stupid. - Would you? I think so, too. Let's play soccer. Almost. Well done! Nice throw! - Thanks. Nice save. Well done! Goal! Liverpool! It's deep. Do you think Mom knows where we are? I think so. She's just relaxing. Mathias, William. Come here. I want to talk to you. Come and sit down. Let's take off your hat. Okay... You know what? Are you crying? - No, no. I have something to tell you. We won't see each other for a long time. Because I'm going away. Why? Because... I have some things to work out. For how long? A long time. A really long time. But I'm still your mother, you know. I'll always be your mother. I'll always love you. No matter where I am. Right? You know I love you, and I'll always be your mother. Can't you cancel it? - Shall I drive you home? Want to go home to Dad? - Yes. Okay. Wake up, boys. You're home. Come along. - Come on, Mathias. Are you tired? Come on, sweetie. Do you have everything? Can I have a hug? Okay. Go inside. Subtitles: Arigon Was I good? You were amazing. Here. - You're sweet. Very lovely and very sweet. Yes, I was damn good. Fucking good. Brilliant. I am. A good mother. Even though you can't tell, I'm actually a good mother. Those 2 boys... They would be boring if it weren't for me. Didn't they only have one son? George and Martha? No, she had 2. 2 beautiful sons with fine, delicate voices. Beautiful, beautiful voices. Who looked like their mother.
