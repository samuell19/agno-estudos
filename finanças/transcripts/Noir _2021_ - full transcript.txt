This city. What can I tell you about the city? New York. A place where the men work hard and the dames well, they do what it is they do. The lively city hides the underbelly that runs through the gutters and the smoke filled streets. That's where I come into play. My name is Detective Sal Pelletier, when I tell you I seen it all. I mean, I seen it all, from the mobsters to the whores, the crooked bankers to the killers that hide in the shadows, waiting to strike when an opportunity appears. Sometimes I look out of my window at this city and then I look up at the sky and I see dark clouds, and all I can think is that God himself is trying to hide this city from his own eyes. Oh, yeah, I seen it all, alright. But tonight's story doesn't take place in some mobster's warehouse or some rundown bar full of the unfortunates of this great city. Our story takes place in the suburbs of New York, a nice street, a middle-class household with a perfect lawn and perfectly respectable residents. But as we know all too well, darkness can hide in the lightest of places. So let me tell you about Veronica. Veronica, Smart. Beautiful, intelligent, but with a life that will be anything but respectable. Veronica was married to Cliff see. They met when they were just college sweethearts. He'd done all right for himself up in the high rises of work with a love of a good woman at home. But temptation can hide around any corner of this great city. And Cliff. Well, Cliff had succumbed to the ways of a woman who wasn't his wife. So that's where we meet them. That's where we meet her. Veronica Smart. Welcome to the world of NOIR. I wish we could stay here all day, locked away in our own private heaven. Well, it certainly beats a cheap motel. I'll give you that. There is nothing wrong with a cheap motel for a quick getaway. It's got clean sheets and a firm mattress. As long as the water is hot and the shower works, then we don't need anything else. Oh, Cliff, you know, the sorts who check into an establishment like that, as my mother would say, they're not the respectable type. Well, we are here in the house perfectly respectable. Well, sadly, I've got to get back to work. My boss can be a real tyrant. Maybe if you ask him nicely he'll give you the day off. OK, Mr. Smart, please, may I take a leave of absence today? Of course Miss Layton, I'm sure you have important business to attend to. Very important and very respectable business. See, that's the problem. Nothing about this is respectable. The surroundings may be tasteful, but we both know. What we have is a good thing. A quick getaway to a motel, a few stolen moments in the office with the blinds closed. We can't do it anymore Cliff. Do what? Stop acting like a fool, Cliff. We both know that you're not. I'm a fool for you. It's not funny Cliff, nothing about this is funny. You mean so much to me. You know that, but I can't break a vow I made to my wife. I think you did already. I think we should end it now. You go back to being my boss. I go back to my life, auditions, and I can find somebody who loves me and only me. We can say hello, go for the occasional dinner with friends, but that's all it could be Cliff. I understand. I do. I know you deserve more, but Lana, I don't want to be without you. Cliff, did you hear that? What? Cliff thats the door. Someone's trying to come in. Get behind the door. What? The door. Get behind the door. I'm not hiding from your wife like I'm some sort of shameful secret. Sweetheart, you are a shameful secret. Lana, please. Working hard. I see. My dear husband. Sweetheart, baby. What are you doing at home? Well, I could ask you the same question, but I think you have to you, Mrs. Smart. I just came to drop something off to your... Oh, so you are aware he's married. I did wonder whether you were clueless or just a whore. Mrs Smart, this has never happened before. I'm sorry. What's your name? It's Lana. Please don't look at me like that. We've all made mistakes, and I'm sure that you've made a few in your many years on the planet. Let me give you a word of advice, sweetheart, from me to you. Looks fade. I can see that, Mrs. Smart. Lana, maybe you should leave. Say something, anything. It's just... It's just what, what excuse are you going to throw at me? We were just talking, I miss talking. Feel like we don't do that anymore. You don't want to hear about me? Talk about us. It's all auditions or standing in line at some cattle call. So this is my fault because I have ambition? I messed up. That's on me. It's just sometimes you you feel so distant, like something I can see, but I just can't quite touch. That, is for the cheap roll in the hay. And that is for trying to put it on me. I've told you Cliff, I've told you for 16 years that this dame has ambition, that is what you married. Sweetheart, listen to me. I have been there for you. I've loved you. I've sdvoted my whole life to you. I know, I know, look, I'm crazy. I should be locked in a loony bin for what I just did. Well, what can I do to make this better? Well, I'm on my knees. A broken and sorry, man. Begging for your forgiveness. Get up. I can't stand weak. A cheap night is one thing, but weakness. That is something I won't accept. I can't bear to see the disappointment in your eyes. Men disappoint Cliff. It's who you are by nature. I shouldn't be surprised. What about the promises you made me, huh? You're 40, Veronica and still no baby? You son of a bitch! Maybe it's time to settle down and become a housewife. A mother, you know, a respectable job. A respectable job. It's not a job Cliff. What's so wrong about being a housewife or a mother. It's sure as hell a lot more respectable than this silly, childish dream. What did you just say? You heard and I ain't apologising for saying it. Goddamn Veronica. I thought this job at the school teaching art would make you happy, you seemed so excited. Firstly, I don't start until tomorrow, and secondly, the only reason I took this job was to get me out of this goddamn house. Oh. As well as giving you more time to bring your lady friends home. Do you think I ever wanted to be the kind of guy who stepped out on his lady? No. But Lana listens to me, she cares about what I have to say. Well that must have been wonderful for you. Look, I have things that I need. The guys are always asking, when are we going to welcome our own little bundle of joy in the world? What am I supposed to tell them? Where the hell are you going? I have come home to find you in bed with another woman, and yet somehow you've managed to make that my fault. I ain't blaming you, baby. Make friends with the spare bed tonight Cliff. I have a feeling you two are going to become very close. Take your filthy cheating hands off of me. Veronica, ain't the forgiving type. They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Well, that saying could have been created for Veronica herself. So The next day, Veronica would start a new job teaching the kids in the ways of art. When she walkd in the door she sure as hell didn't look like no teacher I'd ever seen. Is that for me? Yeah. Good morning, class. My name is Veronica or Mrs. Smart. Good morning, Mrs. Smart. Now I'm here to teach you the beauty of the arts. She was a piece of work, all right. Jimmy was mesmerized. He was only one of a few. She could have been talking about anything, but he wouldn't hear a word. Who is this woman? She's like a real life movie star in front of me. I can't concentrate. I think she knows that I'm staring at her, but I can't look away. It's like somebody pinned my eyes open in only her direction. Her legs, her breasts. The lashings of red lipstick illuminating this gray and drab classroom. I'm aroused. I can't let her see. Of course, she saw that. S he's smiling. Shit, she saw me. Who is this woman? And James, isn't it? What? Oh, yeah, James. Well, Jimmy, OK, Jimmy, what kind of art excites you? Well, I think that art is all around us. An old lady selling roses on the street. Rain on a humid day. A beautiful woman. A beautiful woman. Of course, that might be the most exquisite work of art ever. Who is this woman? She's beautiful. She's confident. She's everything that a girl like me dreams of becoming. I want to stare at her. Like a gentleman would stare at an exquisite painting. Oh, look at her hair. Her long hair that cascades down her back blonde, no golden. I want to know her. I want her to know me. Who is this woman? And Vivian, isn't it? Yeah, I'm Vivian. OK, Vivian. So what kind of art do you like? Vivian's art is about as interesting as her. You think it's OK to berate a woman in front of her class? Now, let me tell you something. There's only one thing this world hates more than a crook. And that is a bully. Why don't you apologize to Miss Pierce here and pray she's understanding enough to forgive you. Sorry, Vivian. It's OK. Now, Vivien, what kind of art do you like? Oh, Vivian's just kooky for the movie pictures. Oh, hi, I'm Betty. I'm Vivian's best friend. Well, it's lovely to meet you, Betty. So, Vivian, the movie pictures? Yeah, but it's a world so far away from us, ordinary people, that I'll never get to experience that. And why do you think that? Because we're nobody. Well, I don't believe that's true at all. Now, it's my understanding that your previous teacher gave you all the picture of a famous painting to discuss. So why don't we start there? OK. Well, I guess I just don't see it. Don't see what? Well it's nice I guess. But it's kind of simple. Why is it so famous when many people can draw this way? You think you could do an oil painting like Thomas Hart Benton? I'm not saying that I could, but I know others who could. Now, does anybody else have an opinion on the painting? It feels cold. The towering skyscrapers below a darkened sky. The American flag blowing in the wind, but the colors are muted. I like the way it feels stationary like the moment froze and he painted that way. It seems bleak, though, but at the same time saying that the artist was seeing things that way. Yeah. Yeah. Like he at that moment, maybe wanted to change or was battling something within himself. It shows that behind the beauty of the city is a danger. Maybe not everything is as it appears to be. Jimmy, Vivian, that was beautifully put. Jimmy, Jimmy, you got to light? Yeah, sure. You know, I really enjoyed your class today. It's nice to have a teacher that knows about the subject that they're teaching. Well, thank you very much. You know, you seem to understand it quite well yourself. Well, when you spend a lot of time alone, gives you time to read. Jimmy, can I say something? Sure. Your eye for the arts is really rather extraordinary. You seem to see things like somebody... Older? Older, yes. Comforts me, honestly. Sometimes I think the real world can seem so. Grey, so... Noisy? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. But well, if you look at a painting like Van Gogh's Cafe Terrace at Night, well, colours the soothing yet vibrant feelings that it gives you. Well, that's my escapism. What got you into art Jimmy? My mother. I was just a kid. I remember her sat in the kitchen painting, she used to always say that the light in the kitchen was perfect, and you must have good natural light. I'd sit and watch her for hours. I'd look at the bliss on her face like she just vanished. Into her own magical world. Well, you know, maybe that's something you should take up for yourself. Live your passion. I said, I loved art, I didn't say I could paint, and trust me, I can't. Plus guys like me from this place. Well art exactly ain't In my future. Where is your mother? She skipped out on us when I was little, so I got stuck with him. God, I'm sorry, it's your first day here, and I'm troubling you with my woes. I found my husband in bed with another woman last night. I'm sorry. I. I don't know why I told you that. You know, you're not like the women around here. Jimmy, Jimmy. Hey, Jimmy, you ready to go? Yeah, sure. I'm just talking to Mrs... Have you seen Vivian? Not since class, oh wait here she comes, control yourself. Vivian you look as beautiful as a bright summers day. Shut up Riff. Mrs Smart. I really enjoyed your class today. It was very uplifting. Uplifting? Well, thank you very much, Betty. Umm Mrs. Smart. Can I just say that? Wow. You look like a movie star. Well, so I've been told. Actually I am an actress. What, like in the movies? Sure. Well, only a few small roles, but I have done many plays. One critic once called me dazzling. Dazzling. Wow. That's my dream, to be somebody that people talk about my face on the big screen. You would look magnificent Vivian, a real bombshell. Oh, you really think so, Riff? Sure thing. Well, you know, I was actually thinking about perhaps teaching, acting to people like you, young people who you want to make it in the movies. Oh, this is smart. I mean, I would love that. Well, money. My mother. Oh, baby. And I wouldn't dream of charging. Everybody deserves a shot. Oh, Mrs. Smart, then I would love to. Oh, you have no idea how happy this makes me. How about you, Jimmy? You have a face the camera would love. Really? Well, I don't know about all that acting stuff, but I'd sure love to sit and listen to you talk about it. Can I come, too? I'm a real movie picture fan, you know. Oh, well, sure. Well, this sounds like a plan. So why don't we say my place tomorrow night, say 7:00? What will your husband say? Well, he's working very late tomorrow night, so we'll have the place to ourselves. Well, I will be there with bells on. Oh, maybe you could show me how to make my hair like yours. I think I would trade in my best friend to look like you. Wait, What? Vivian Pierce, where are you? Great! Mother. I was just talking to Mrs. Smart. She's my new teacher and she's an actress. It's lovely to meet you. Charmed, I'm sure. Now, Vivian, Betty let's go we're having an early supper tonight before your father heads off to work late, again. Mrs Smart. I can't wait for us to begin our lessons. Mrs. Smart. Boys. I don't think she liked me very much. She doesn't like anybody, including her own husband. Poor schlep. I'd always had problems in the neighborhood where kids like Jimmy and Riff lived. It wasn't the safest of places in the town. Poverty was the word of the day, the kind of place the rest of the town looked down on like a blemish that wouldn't go away. I think she looked at me today. Who? Vivian. I swear she did, Jimmy. She looked round and for a moment, our eyes connected. I think you see what you want to see. Trust me, I've known her for years. You've known for years. When has she ever shown any interest in a guy like you? What do you mean a guy like me? What kind of crack is that? No crack. It's cool. It's just... It's just what? Come on Riff, you've been loopy for Vivian since we were 10 years old, it's time to move on. Go swivel Jimmy. Pair of aces. Damn it, man. I can't concentrate. My mind feels like cotton candy. I mean, it wasn't just me, right? Mrs Smart is... A babe? A doll? Yeah, but it's more than that, before you turned up we were really talking. Man. She's like a hundred? No, Jesus. She's like 40 I bet. That's a woman who's seen a lot of things. Yeah. Like the backseat in many a Chevrolet. Hey don't talk that way. You shouldn't talk that way about a lady. She's taken Jimmy, did you not see the rock on her finger, He's a deadbeat, he cheats on her? Wait she told you this? Yeah, I told you we talked. Damn it. I can't wait to see her tomorrow. Oh you are lost to the darkside my friend. Darkside? Women. And Vivien? It's Destiny. Seeing her today just made me realise girls, they don't know anything about life, love, sex... Sex. You think you're going to be playing backseat bingo with her? No, you clown. I'm just saying that today opened my eyes. I mean, come on. She's like something from a movie. Well, Jimmy, as much fun as it is, I really got to go. I'm going to miss the best time. Riff, I can speak to my old man. See if you can stay with us. You don't deserve to be out on the street. You got to be able to... I know, Jimmy, you've given me the same speech since the funeral. But I'm fine. Really? I got everything under control. Yeah, but I got this, Jimmy. Sleeping down the docks again tonight? Yeah, I found this great old building. I share it with like 300 bats. Shut up. You hear that? Oh, shit. My dad's home. Jimmy! So this is what happens when I'm not here? No. You just thought you would steal my cigarettes and act like a big man when I ain't around. I should go. It's lovely to see you, Mr. Flynn. May I say you are looking particularly rugged today. Get out! I'm going to go to my room. Why? You scared of your old man? No, sir. I just. So you think you're a man now because you started smoking cigarettes? Go on. Show me how much of a man you really are. Leave me alone. You know, we should put a dress on you so anyone can see how much of a girl you are. Look at you, you dress like some rebel but you, you're as soft as a newborn babies backside. Oh, wait. I need you down at the garage tomorrow night, we've got two cars coming in that need to be finished. Sure. Oh, no, I can't. I've already made plans. Plans? You don't have plans you're just a kid. I'm sixteen. I'm sorry, Dad, but I can't make it tomorrow. Oh, you will be there, or you can pack up your stuff and see how you do out there on the street Dad please. You are sixteen Jimmy, it's time to be a man and make an honest wage. You can't expect me to have you here living forever. Now, go to your room and stay there, I got a friend coming over tonight and I do not want to be disturbed. A woman? None of your goddamn business, you don't even know what a woman is. Now get out of my sight. Yes sir. At Vivian's house. Well, Vivian was brought up under the eyes of God, a devout kind of family, a cross on the wall and a Bible on the nightstand. But Vivian is a teenage girl starting to question things. I'm glad your mother let me stay over Vivian. Oh, me too. Plus, I know it's your father's cards night? His friends give me the heebie jeebies. Betty, do you think I could ever look like Veronica Smart? Vivian, you've not stopped talking about her since we left school. Sorry Betty, it's just I've only ever seen women like her in the pages of our celebrity magazine. Imagine a woman like that. Living right here in our town. You sound screwy Vivian Pierce. It's not like she's Lana Turner. Oh she was so perfect. OK, I'm officially ignoring you. Sorry, Betty. You are going to come to hers tomorrow, though, of course. No way. My mother would flip her wig. She thinks that actors are lower than whores. Her words, not mine. Well, I think your mother and my mother are the same person. I'm going to brush my teeth. It's spearmint! Oooh, I'm sorry Mrs Pierce. Now, Vivien, I need to talk to you. Am I in trouble? No, I'm worried about you. And so is your father. You come home from school and disappear so fast to your room that we barely get a hello. I'm fine, mother, honestly. It's just. Oh Vivian, it's just what? Well, when did you first start to get feelings for boys? You know, in the non friend way? Vivian, you are too young to be thinking about that. I'm fifteen mother, please. There is a time and place for a man and that time is not now. Do you want to end up like the neighbours daughter out all hours, drinking, cavorting around with every boy that looks at her? Sure sounds more fun than this. Look. I know I sound harsh, and I'm not saying that when you're older, you can't make your own choices, but I have to guide you now so those choices you make in the future are good ones. Worrying about boys and playing this kind of music is most certainly not a good one. It's just music, mother. I don't think Satan plans on coming through my record player to corrupt me. Vivian! You are not too old to be put over your father's knee. Sorry, mother. You just need to say your prayers before bed. Go to church. Study hard. And then you can think about a husband. But mother, if I'm too young to date, surely I'm too young to think about a husband. Vivian. Nobody likes a smart mouth. Now turn those records off It's time for bed for you two. Oh no, five more minutes mother, please. Fine. Five more minutes then bed. OK. Oh, sorry Mrs Pierce. Oh Vivian, I forgot to mention, I think I know who was going to ask you to the dance. Do you think she would let me try on one of her dresses? Oh, I bet she gets them from Europe. OK, good night, Vivian. Sorry, Betty. After catching Cliff and Lana in the sinful act, something in Veronica changed or maybe just brought the real her to the surface. Either way, the kids were so blinded by her, they wouldn't see anything the dame wouldn't allow them to see. It's the evening after and Cliff is away with work. Veronica, well Veronica is dressed like a goddamn lounge singer, wearing a bright red dress, showing off all her killer curves. Anybody order a group of street rats? Speak for yourself Riff Randall. I am so pleased you could all make it, come in. Woah! You've got a real nice pile of bricks here Mrs Smart. Oh, please call me Veronica. OK, Veronica. Now, who would like a drink, something to get this party started? Alcoholic? I won't tell anyone if you won't. Then I'll have a beer. How about you two? Oh, no, just a lemonade for me, please. Sure. You got whiskey? I do indeed. So I heard your old man is stepping out on you. Riff, Jesus. No, it's fine, honestly. Men are pigs. (Pig noises) Mrs. Smart? Um, I mean, Veronica, your dress is so magnificent. Oh, what? This old thing. Oh, I would love a dress like that. And your hair. How do you get it to look so glamorous? Vivian. Well, I think you have a beautiful face, stunning bone structure, and those eyes. They could melt the heart of a sailor. Oh, oh, oh. Ok Vivian, relax. I could relax you, Vivian. Ewww. Do I see a little love connection here? Flirtation? No, you do not. Riff has been trying to get me to go steady with him since we're six years old. He's not my type. Maybe you don't know what your type is. So how about you, Jimmy? You got a lady in your life? Girls my age aren't appealing to me. I'm going to wait till after high school to find my girl. I see. Can I get another drink? Oh, sure, help yourself. But just don't let your parents know I'm letting you drink liquor. Can I smoke? Sure. As long as I can bum one from you. Can I bum one also? Here, Vivian, let me light it for you. I think I'll save this for later. So, Jimmy, when you're alone, what is it you like to do? Listen to music, read books, play my guitar. Oh the guitar. I play the violin. Oh really, well the violin, the guitar, hell even the goddamn drums. I think it's all wonderful. Hey, Riff, turn up the music. Let's dance. What? Here, now? Here and now is all we have Jimmy Flynn. Veronica, Riff and Jimmy danced around the room. Veronica looked happy and the kids ate up that happiness with a silver spoon. Jimmy played it cool, leaning on the cabinet of trophys from her husband's college days. It's rude to stare, Jimmy. I'm sorry. The last man who stared at me that way, ended up laying beside me for the next 16 years. She got him! Oh, I'm so, so sorry. I'll clean all that up. It's fine, honestly. My husband, he breaks a lot of glasses. What's he doing? Throwing them around the house. In that moment, Veronica started to lie. Yeah. Sometimes he... He what? Never mind. Marriage is tough kids. You try so hard to to be the perfect housewife, and yet still it's it's never quite enough. He cheated, many times I suspect, he didn't even apologize. He just said that the man's got to do what a man's got to do. That's what he said. Listen to me bringing the party down. I'm so sorry whilst we are here in this house. Let's forget all the bad in our lives and just focus on the good. Oh, Veronica, I just wanted to ask, what movies have you starred in? Did you see Hunt for Love with Cary Grant? Oh, I love that movie. Well, I was the nurse who got him back to health. So you met him? Darling, met him? We're friends, we bonded over our love for the silent movies. Oh, Vivian. The stories I could tell you. Oh, I would love to hear them. So, Jimmy, you got a talent? Boosting cars? Mmm, a bad boy? I prefer rebel. You have ice? Sure it's in the kitchen. Help yourself. Vivian why don't you help Riff with the ice and maybe bring in some snacks? Sure thing. Veronica, why us? What do you mean Riff? Why would you want to be friends with us? I mean, you're a beautiful, wealthy woman. We're hardly your usual crowd. Honestly, I never really fit in around here. Housewives, they look at me like I'm trash and the men look at me with lustful eyes. I guess I just needed a change of energy around me. You know, you have a really neat set of records. Oh, thanks. My husband hates them of course. He's not really that big into the music or movies or art. He's a bit square when it comes to those things. You like this one? Sure. Tell me more about you, Jimmy. What do you want to know? Everything. Well, I'm 16, but I think I'm more mature my age. I ride a motorcycle. So, are you going to come over here and dance with me or you just going to leave this girl dancing all by herself. I love to dance. I love to dance with a man who loves to dance. It's been a long time. Forgive me for saying but why not just ditch the loser if he ain't keeping your engine running? Oh, Jimmy, it's not as simple as that. Let's just forget about him. Let's just pretend that nobody in the whole world is around. We just keep on dancing. Your smell it's. It's quite intoxicating. You smell of cigarette smoke, liquor and engine fumes. I'm sorry. Don't be, I love that smell. Jimmy, when you go out on your bike where is it you go to? I know a spot out by the woods near the cemetery. It's quiet. Gives me time to think Maybe I need a spot like that. I can take you to mine. On your bike? Sure. You could hop on and hold on. We could go now. Oh, Jimmy I'd love to. We could come with you. I have my car, I could drive us over. Well, sure. I mean, why not? The more the merrier. Looks like tonight's going to be quite an adventure. Jimmy Flynn. After a night of fun with her new friends, the next day, a Saturday, Veronica travelled into the city to pay a visit to Cliff with a surprise for her sweetheart. She had the perfect guise to see if Cliff was a man of his word. Good morning Mrs Smart. Good to see you Mrs Smart. He's in his office Mrs Smart. Maybe I didn't make myself clear Cliff. Sweetheart. Baby, what are you doing here? Oh, I had something to attend to in the city, so I thought I'd bring you a gift. This is just work Veronica, you think I'd fool around in my office? I don't know, Cliff. I didn't expect you to fool around in our bedroom, but you proved me wrong on that one. Mrs Smart. I understand what I did was wrong, but I assure you I don't want your husband. You are acting crazy. Oh, is that so? And you are acting like a desperate fool. Did I not tell you to get rid of her? Excuse me. She's leaving at the end of the week. This is just work, Veronica. You really expect me to believe that this thing will be gone by the end of the week? That's right, Mrs. Smart. This "thing" handed in her notice today. It's true baby, Lana's an actress. She's been auditioning for new plays on Broadway. And I found out today that I got a part in the new Eugene O'Neill play. I leave in a week for two out of town tryouts, then Broadway. Baby. Isn't that exciting? Lana, I need to have a talk with my husband. Of course, Mrs Smart. Honestly, I... Out! She's, she's leaving at the end of the week, why fire the girl if she is going anyway. She's an actress? Yeah, baby. Oh, like you. Maybe she could put a word in for you. You want your mistress to put a good word in for your wife. Are you hearing yourself, Cliff? I'm just thinking of you, baby. You know, Cliff, for such a big shot, you really are stupid. You're attracted to her because. She's me 16 years ago. Baby that ain't true, she can't hold a candle to you. It is Cliff, she's living my life. She gets to be the big star while I'm stuck here teaching kids to do what I should be doing. God damn you Cliff, you really know how to hurt a lady. Well, I ain't trying to... Don't. Just don't Cliff. I hurt too much. Well, what can I do, you want me to tell her to leave right this moment because I'll do it? No, no Cliff. Let your floozy stick around, because the only thing I want. Is the last 16 years of my life back. Don't talk that way. When I was a little girl, I used to dream about what my life would be like. One thing I knew for certain. Was that I wanted to be somebody? I wanted more than those four dark, damp walls that trapped me as a child and I wanted more than my mother's loneliness and disappointment. I just knew I needed more. I would dance around in my room. Arms extended, imagining I was I was up on a stage, a vaudeville show or movie picture, I didn't care. I just knew I needed more. And then I met you. Happiest day in my whole entire life. And I thought to myself. Could this be my more to be this handsome man's wife and I thought and thought. And as much as I loved you, I knew I just couldn't give up on that part of my dream with you. You said all the right things to ease my mind. Do you remember, do you remember what you said to me when we first got together Cliff? I said I could make you happy. You said that my dreams, my ambitions would always be as important as yours, that we would help each other and support each other in it. I remember thinking perfect. Now I can be whole. But you never, never helped me or supported me, not in any way that matters, because you thought that eventually I'd give up on that part of my life. And I would just learn to be silent and just become your wife. Baby that ain't true. It is Cliff. When have you ever taken me Hollywood? I have been asking you for 16 years, but still you've never taken me. Baby, you don't need Hollywood to be a star. I know that. But I need it to make me one. Jesus, how the hell did I end up here? Now. Just stop that. This ain't a bad life you got for yourself here, Veronica. Oh, Cliff. These past few days have just confirmed everything that I already knew. You don't want me to have my more. But you sure as hell want to have yours. So that's it. We even gonna talk? Not now, Cliff. I may say something that I truly regret. Well. Will, I see you at home later? Go for a long walk after work tonight. Maybe a couple of drinks, because I really need some time to figure out what it is that I want. It ain't no mystery that the youths who live in the slum side of town lived a life of risk. Some of the kids like Riff didn't live with their parents. For them it is the street. Some have to work their fingers to the bone, sacrificing an education to pitch in. Sure, the boys had a few run ins with the law, but it was petty stuff, mainly just to put a hot meal inside them. But these were good kids, living in surroundings that could easily take them down the wrong path. That night, Jimmy joined Riff by the Docks, a regular hangout for the undesirables of the city. So what you get? Two bucks and a coupon for canned meat. Damn it Jimmy, I can't keep doing this. Doing what? Pickpocketing, breaking into people's houses. Well you know what to do Riff. I can't stay with you. I ain't going to be a burden to nobody. Riff you ain't no burden, your my best friend. I want to help. Jimmy, your old man can barely afford to keep you, he ain't looking for no new kid in the house. I gotta have a future Jimmy, I just gotta. This can't be it. I know just how you feel Riff, but. Well, that's a problem for another day. No, it ain't, we're sixteen now Jimmy there's a whole world out there, opportunities you know. Sure thing Riff, but that's a whole world you and I ain't ever going to see. Don't say that. It's been one year since my parents die. Jeez. I didn't even realise. I'm sorry. One year since the fire. God, that one moment in my life and I lost everything. You know. You are my family. I know. I mean, it is great. But I mean, it's not the same. After seeing Veronicas house I got this aching feeling all over me. What do you mean? I got jealous? All that money, the house, all those rooms. My house burns to the ground, taking my parents with it and here I am. When did we get chosen to be the failures? We ain't living in a world that wants to hear what we got to say. You know, people would rather just walk past us, pretend we don't exist. Why does it have to be final? People must find a way out of this. I mean, Jesus Jimmy, my shoes are falling apart, I haven't slept well in a year, and I'm hungry. I'm hungry all the time. The only time I get to eat is at school. Whatever happened to the American dream? The thing with the American dream is most of us wake up. We move on. Not everyone can be a success. No. Riff the streets are paved with shit and poverty. The gold, It's rare. Now, we may never get the gold, but we just got to avoid the shit, you know. So what, I just sit here and hope some shlep gives me a dime or two? God bless America. I can grab you something from my house. Or I could. Help. You know. If I gotta take something heavy on, I'm doing it alone. I'm fine, really Jimmy. You just go home, I'll see you tomorrow. I promise. Alright. You be careful out here, you hear me. Jimmy leaves Riff on the docks, but as Riff follows him away See you tomorrow Riff. He sees a man walking down the docks. Alone. You need to eat Riff. But as the figure gets closer. Well, how could he know? How could he have known the man approaching was Cliff Smart, wandering the streets, thinking about his failures as a husband? Hey, step aside. Not so fast, mister. I'm going to need ten, I mean five bucks for you to pass. A tax, if you will. I said, get out of my way. I ain't in the mood. I ain't gonna ask you again. Look at you ain't getting anything from me. So why don't you run on home to mommy and daddy so they can teach you some respect? What did you say? I said move. I just need some money for some food... Ain't interested in your sob story, kid. Jesus. Your parents sure as hell failed you. Oh, you are dead! I just wanted to eat, why couldn't you see, I just wanted to eat, I ain't a bad kid, I swear. I'm sorry, Mr. I'm sorry. Cliff. What happened to you, are you ok? Sure, act like you care, Veronica. What a cold thing to say. I ain't in the mood to argue. Come here. Let me see it. Oh, that looks like a nasty gash, I think we're going to have to call Dr. Morgan out just to be safe. I don't need that quack. I'll be fine as soon as my head stops spinning. Well, what happened to you? It looks as though you were attacked. I took a walk after work down by the waterfront. I went down through the tunnel where the street kids live. One of them hit me with a bat and took my money, son of a bitch. If I ever lay my eyes on him again, then. He ain't going to see his next birthday. Why would you go down there? I was trying to clear my mind. You told me to take a walk. You needed time. But down there. The police should take out a gun and get rid of the vermin who do nothing but dirty up the city. Cliff, most of them are children who have fallen on hard times. Not everybody was as privileged as you were. Wait, your defending them? No, no. It's just. Some of the kids I teach live down there, you know, school is all they have at given them any kind of a shot. I just feel sorry for them. Well they ain't getting a shot. God don't pay no attention to those kinds. You really can be so cruel. Hey, it's my head split open here. So these boys, what do they look like? All these street kids look the same to me, although I do know that one of them was called Riff. Riff? Yeah. One of his friends shouted at him, slipped up and used his name. Degenerates. He could have killed you. Some say that the kids never stood a chance. They were broken, searching for something more and easily manipulated by a woman who took advantage of it all. I say, I guess that's for you to decide. But one thing is undeniable. She certainly shook things up all right and she spun a web that a vulnerable person could easily fall into. And Vivian, did. You have been out after school every evening this week, where are you going? I am not telling you mother, because you'll only judge. Fine. Then you won't be leaving this house tonight. Vivian Pierce. I am not a child anymore. I'm fifteen. A child is exactly what you are. You're out with those boys again. Do you think I don't know that you can't outsmart your mother. Ha! Then you're wrong. Vivian! I've been going to see my new teacher, actually. Mrs Smart? The lady I met? Yes. She's been teaching me all about how to make it in Hollywood. Private lessons for free. Oh, mother. She's one of the most fascinating people I've ever met. Acting, no. But mother, it's something I want so bad that it hurts. Oh, Vivian, you are not going to be a movie star. You are far too plain looking. No, no, I'm not, I've got great bone structure. Veronica told me. I don't know what's going on with you, Vivian, but I don't like it. Why can't you just be happy? Because I've lived Vivian. I know the dangers and I want to protect you. I am going, mother. It's a scary world out there. And people's motives aren't always what they appear to be. Living with that fear is not living, mother. Now. I'll be home by ten. Don't wait up. My dad doesn't show love. He hates me. No. It's cool. Sometimes you're not supposed to like your parents or they're not supposed to like you, I guess. That's tough. Jimmy, what scares you? I guess, turning out like him. Staying in this town my soul rotting away until there's nothing left. Just a black hole. You can always leave. And go where? It's a pipe dream, I'm never going to have that kind of money. Well, all I can do is wait for the old man to meet his maker. Maybe I'll get the house, you know, sell it and leave, but. Until then I guess I just. Stay still. Motionless. Like a car without an engine. I guess we all get stuck from time to time in a position that we just can't get out of. Your husband? I feel like I'm drowning in my own personal hell. Then why don't you just leave him? It's not as simple as that, he owns everything, the house, the cars, the money. I have nothing. Material stuff isn't everything. It is Jimmy. You can't live without money. I should have been somebody by now, but he's always held me back, he's never let me be who I should be. You know what, if this is it for me now, what if my... what if my time is done? It doesn't have to be. Oh would you listen to me? I'm so sorry, I shouldn't be putting my problems onto you. Can you forgive me. You have done nothing to be forgiven for. Jimmy? Would you excuse me for a moment? I'll be right back. Veronica gets up and leaves the room, leaving Jimmy alone. What is she doing? What is she up to? Everything about it was calculated, you see, every word, every gesture, every move. When she walked back into the room, her motives were clear. But as Veronica seduced Jimmy in her marital bed, both had failed to notice that Vivian had arrived and she saw all she needed to see. Honey, I'm home. Cliff, another night with Lana? No, I was with a friend, a man can have friends, you know, And what a good friend she is. And, uh, what about you, my dear wife? How did you spend your evening? Well, I thought I'd invite some men over and start a torrid affair behind your back. That's funny. Oh, I'm drunk. So I see. What the hell is this? What? Don't tell me the several guys who came to visit with you, right? Yes Cliff. That's exactly right. Have you got some guy Veronica? Yes, actually, his names Jimmy. Oh, and Riff, and Vivian. Two guys in my house with my wife. Are you completely insane? Oh, relax, Cliff. It's just three students that I teach over at the school. I'm giving them private acting lessons. Why didn't you tell me? Would you care? I care, I always care. God we used to laugh. We used to make love all night. We used to talk until the early hours of the morning, but now I. I barely get a hello. Godammit Veronica, I'm hurting, I'm hurting real bad and if your not ready to forgive me then... What? What Cliff? Oh, God damn it Veronica, you are milking this for all you can. How do I know that you ain't cheating, huh? I mean, you said you've had these kids over, but how do I know that ain't a cover and you've been stepping out on me? Veronica, steady as a rock rises slowly out of her chair. Has the cat got your tongue Veronica. Hahaha. Where the hell are you going Veronica? Veronica! God damn, what the hell are you doing Cliff. (Motorcycle Sound) (Thunder) Jimmy, thank God you came, I didn't know who else to call. Of course I came. You sounded scared. I knew something was wrong. Of course you did, because you get me, Jimmy. I knew it from the first day we met. Oh, God. Jimmy, what am I doing? Talk to me. Wipe your tears and talk to me. What happened? Jimmy, he was so angry when he came home tonight. It was like his face changed into something I'd never seen before. What did he do? Jimmy, the violence in his eyes. He hit you? And then Veronica lied. Yes, I think he wanted to hurt me. After he struck my face, he just started yelling at me. He called me names that no woman should ever be called. That son of a bitch. He started ripping at my clothes like a wild beast would do his eyes, they were so black, blacker than the darkest of nights. How can a man put his hands on a woman like that? I mean, I know that I'm not perfect, but even I know that when a guy meets a girl like you, she should be treated like the queen that she is. Oh, Jimmy. Jimmy your words, I love your words. But I think Cliff thinks... What? What does he think? That maybe I talk about a certain student too much. Perhaps I'm looking at him with eyes. I used to look at my husband with. Jimmy, do you look at me that way? Veronica, I can't stop thinking about you. The other night... But this is wrong. Everything about this is wrong. I'm your teacher. You're only sixteen. Men have done great things at sixteen I told you I'm more mature. Yes, I see that, I see it all, that beauty, God such beauty. Jimmy, what are we doing? I don't know, but I don't want it to stop. I can't stop thinking about kissing you, your arms wrapped around me tight. Veronica. To look into your beautiful eyes as you make love to me all night long again. I want to kiss you so bad. But I ain't about to cause you any problems. Oh, Jimmy. You're not my problem, don't you see? You're my bright, shining light. The two kiss passionately as the rain pours down, maybe to wash their sins away. It was a point of no return. Love, lust, desperation, manipulation. Nobody knew at that point, least of all Jimmy Flynn, a sixteen year old boy whose fantasy was coming to life. So what do you think, Betty? I think your mothers going to send you to a convent in a dress like that. Where did you get it from? Oh, Veronica gave it to me. She said I should really start to dress to be the person I want to be. A bar room hooker? No Betty, a movie star. I don't even know why you think she's so special. She's hardly a young starlet. You don't understand, Betty. Her husband stopped her going into the movies anymore. She used to be somebody. Oh, really? Is that what she told you? Why aren't you happy for me? You know, Veronica said you should really surround yourself with people who believe in you. Jeez. Are you trying to say I'm not supportive. I just think you could embrace my new look more. I would if Veronica wasnt trying to turn you into something that you ain't. I would if I wasn't losing my best friend to her. Oh, that's rather dramatic, Betty. Really? You were supposed to stay at mine last night but you never showed. Oh, jeez, Betty. I'm so sorry. I completely forgot. It's like you love her. I admire her. And I just want to be like her. I mean, what kind of life do I really have after school huh? Veronica's just showing me a new way. So I see. Mother, I... What on earth do you think you are doing? It's just a dress Mother. You look like one of the girls who frequent the men's clubs. Mother, I am changing. You need to understand that. You are a little girl playing dress up. Now, take it off I don't want to see you in that again. No, mother. This is the new me. And if you can't accept that, then we really don't have anything else to discuss. How dare you talk to me in that way? Your father is going to hear about this and then you will be sorry. Stop trying to turn me into you. I want more from my life than what you have, and I'm sorry, mother, but if this was my life, I would kill myself. Vivian. I should go. Ah, Jimmy, hey, pass me that wrench. OK, but it's midnight dad I gotta go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, woah. Help me up. Where the hell do you think you're going? To meet my friends, I told you. Not tonight. Dad. I said not tonight. I need you here. I don't want to work here, dad. I got other dreams that I want to achieve, and I've been here all day. It ain't like I'm getting paid. You have a roof over your head and hot meals on the table. I'm your son. I ain't some employee. Don't you want more for me? What I want is for you to watch your mouth and get back to work. Dad, please. I've really got to see someone tonight. Who? Who is more important than your old man? You wouldn't understand. A broad, you want to skip out with some dame? This ain't some broad dad, she's special. She makes me feel I ain't the disappointment you keep reminding me I am. Jimmy. You ain't going. Yeah, watch me. Oh, what? What? You going to beat me again, huh? Old man, I ain't gonna let you knock me around anymore. Why you always got to see me as the bad guy, Jimmy. I'm just doing my best to guide you. Guide me? You mean destroy me. You know, I'd have more respect if you told me that you hated me. I don't hate you Jimmy. I just know what's best for you. You don't even know what's best for yourself. Jimmy! Get back here now! Veronica was like a whirlwind, she was already leaving her mark and what a mark it was. But that night as clouds rolled over the city, things will take a turn, a dark turn that will change everything. It's nice, isn't it. Us being able to do this. These past few weeks with you have been incredible Veronica. They sure have and you're right, it is nice. I just wish it could be like this all the time. Yeah. Wake up in the morning, take a ride on my bike wherever you want to go. Hollywood. Hollywood, it is. We could watch the sunset over the City of Angels. We could hold each other tightly wrapped up, nice and warm in a blanket. Do you think it could ever happen, Veronica? That you leave Cliff. If I had the money, the security. I would in a heartbeat Jimmy. I have a little saved. That's very sweet, but a little saved, won't get us very far. If only Cliff wasn't around. Yeah. If only. I don't think you're old enough to be drinking my liquor. Who the hell are you? The man of the house. Oh, Mr. Smart. Wait a minute, I know you, Oh, shit! It's you, the kid with the bat. Mister I didn't know you were Veronica's husband. You are dead! Get the hell of him Mr Smart, run Riff! Why are you in my house? We know your wife. She's teaching us, asking. Where's my wife? She's upstairs. Do you want me to go get her? Is she alone? Alone? Is my wife alone? Get the hell out of my house. Now, and you tell your friend I'll be seeing you again Riff, real soon. What the hell is this? Cliff, I didn't expect you home tonight. So I see. So when I'm gone, you have kids over to get drunk in my house. These are your new... friends? I told you Cliff, I'm giving them acting lessons. Oh, yeah. So what's this? Some kind of love scene in my bed? Excuse me? Jimmy, you should go. Yeah, Jimmy, maybe you should leave my bedroom, that I share with my wife. We were just talking, must you act like such a brute. Mr Smart, Veronica and I... There ain't no Veronica and you kid, now run home like a good little boy. Cliff. Get out of my house. I said, get out of my house. What's wrong? Do you not hear too good? I said, get out of my house. Cliff! Stop it, stop it. You've been looking at my wife? Touching her? If you're man enough to go near her, you're man enough to fight me. Cliff! If you don't leave him alone I'm going to call the police. I know your type, Jimmy. Oh, you think you can get what you want from her. Huh? Maybe you should stick to the slum side of town because I don't ever want to see you around here again. I'm going alright. I'm going. Stay away from my wife, Jimmy. Or I'll rip you to pieces, limb by limb, do we understand each other? How dare you? What the hell do you think you're doing? Don't. Don't talk to me. We were just working Cliff. And the kids downstairs? Students. The boy that attacked me with the bat, that was him that sewer rat was in my living room. But I'm sure he didn't know who you were. He could have killed me and what would you have done then, huh? One of your students attacks your husband, bashes his skull in. Jesus, what kind of company do you keep? Cliff wait. Do you want me divorce you, leave you with nothing? No Cliff, you're getting it all wrong. Good night, my dear wife. Now, here is the thing. This dame ain't going to do well in poverty. Poor is not a style she wears well. Well, this is the part you may not believe, but I assure you every word is true. Veronica slammed her face against the hard wall. Why? Well, after a quick phone call to a distraught Jimmy and a late night meeting arranged, a bruise would sell Veronica's story perfectly. Oh, God. Jimmy, Jimmy, are you OK? Son of a bitch. Your face, what did he do to your face? I told you, Jimmy. He's a violent brute of a man. I never wanted you to get hurt. Forget about me. We need to get you away from him. He can't do this to you. But how? Just, just leave him. Who cares if he leaves you with nothing? You have me. We have each other. Jimmy, you're young. You don't understand how much living can cost. We would be broke, unhappy and resenting each other in no time. Face it Jimmy. I'm stuck with him until my dying day. No. No, we have to think of another way. I can't live another day without you. I love you. Jimmy. Do you love me? Everything about this is wrong, and yet I have never felt more safe in anyone's arms as I do in yours. I want to go back there and show him who's the man around here. Jimmy, I just had a thought. A horrible thought. What is it, Veronica? Tell me. I couldn't. It's too awful. Yes, you can just just say it. Well, the way I see it is that only Cliff and the lack of money stands in the way of true happiness. OK. But if Cliff wasn't around, if Cliff died, I would get everything. We would have everything we need to have the perfect life together. But he isn't going anywhere. You saw him. He's as strong as an ox. Jimmy, I could pay, I could pay anyone who helps. I mean, think about it, Jimmy. This is New York. People die all the time. We could say that it was a robbery gone bad. Nobody would suspect you. Why would they? Nobody knows about us other than those two. And they won't say a word. I will make sure of that. Think about it, Jimmy. Think about it, this could work, we could be free. What are you saying, Veronica? Jimmy, I want you to kill my husband. (Thunder Crashes) What's all this? I did you the favour of packing your bags for you baby? You're absurd Cliff. Look, I don't want to hear it Veronica, seeing you sat on our bed with that kid was one thing, but it was the look in your eyes that told me everything. What are you talking about? The betrayal was in your eyes. I saw it the moment I walked in the bedroom. Oh, you're talking in circles Cliff. Why aren't you listening to me! Cliff! I want you gone Veronica. I am done. You lie, all you do is lie. I can't trust you, I can't trust a word that comes out of your mouth. You strung me along for years. You never had any intention of becoming a mother. I see that now. Now you're painting yourself as a victim Cliff. Again, you cheated. This isn't about that. Look I haven't got a future with you. I see that now baby, you've made that perfectly clear. You son of a bitch. Well if you think I'm walking away from this marriage with nothing but a few cases of clothing? Well, there it is. Money, belongings and things. That's all you care about, right, Veronica? You won't get away with this. Big words, but we both know that I will. You are making a mistake, Cliff. You know, um. That kid, Riff, the kid that was in my house. What about him? Look, just a pretty small world ain't it. Just one of the kids that you've been hopelessly flaunting yourself in front of like some cheap whore. Just happens to be the kid who attacks me. What are you saying? Did you put him up to that Veronica? God, how could you even think that? Oh, well, here we go. Bring on the tears. Why don't you save them for one of your teenage lovers? I'm sure they'll eat em up. You're insane, sick, thinking that I would sleep with a student. You know, the fact that you even suggested it says more about you. Well, I know you, Veronica, and I know when you lie. You cannot divorce me. Oh, really? Why don't you watch me? Cliff, I never slept with anyone else. Lies! I had nothing to do with Riffs attack. Lies! Please wait. We just, we got to talk. I'm done talking. No Cliff, please. I said I'm done Veronica. Please Cliff, I have something to tell you. Oh, Veronica, she never misses a trick. Cliff. I'm pregnant. Where the hell do you think you're going? I told you, I have a date with my lady, tonight. Jimmy, you've been seeing this woman for the last three weeks, but tonight, tonight, your working. Dad please, I've really got to see her tonight. Jimmy. Who the hell is this woman? Just somebody, you don't know her. Well, whoever she is, she's got you acting like a damn fool. Why dad? Because I'm in love. Because I don't piss my life down the drain like you. You think I never knew love before your mother. I remember falling all over myself for this one broad. Patricia. Oh, I never seen a lady like that, and make no mistake, she was a real lady. I fell so hard for her, my first love. At eighteen, I started planning my future around her, believing everything she said. Life was perfect. I was happy and happiness was hard to come by you know when I was a teenager. And one day, out of the blue, I found out she got married to another guy. I had no idea that she was stepping out on me, and she she never let slip. The pain was too much. I was left picking up the pieces. Then I met your mother. Look, it ain't worth it, just just focus on your work. That is something that will give you a future. I don't want to be like you dad, I'm sorry, but I have bigger plans for myself. Oh, yeah, what plans? Plans. Plans. You're lliving in La La Land, Jimmy. You think somebody like you becomes a somebody? They don't. Look around you, Jimmy. Your whole future is mapped out. Well, I want more. You're a fool Jimmy Flynn, and this world ain't kind to fools. I love her. I love her dad. You're sixteen. You have no idea what love is. Now get ready to be down at the garage at six thirty, it's an all nighter again. Dad. Please. I'm dressed. I said six thirty. Jimmy. Jimmy! Well, it really is beautiful here, Jimmy. I can see why you like to come here and think. It's hard to find peace in a city that's always moving. But when I was little, my mom used to bring me up here. She used to say that we had to pretend that we're not in the big city anymore, but just on some small island away from everything and everyone. Your mother sounded like a smart lady. They spoke for hours. It was like nothing else mattered. The question haunting both of them had simply vanished. Veronica and Jimmy felt free and opened up their souls. Jimmy spoke about how his mother had skipped out on us. I've never felt so unwanted before. I remember crying my bedroom days just waiting for her to return. He went on to say how he hated his father for making her leave us and how he dreamed every day of of travelling the world, seeing things that you can only see in Life magazine. Veronica was playful. She laughed and giggled like she was experiencing her first crush. She spoke about how she dreamed to become a movie star. You know, I wanted it ever since I was a little girl. And now she fell in love with the pictures on the big screen when my father would take me to watch one movie a week. I remember sitting there and looking up at that big screen and just wanting to walk right into it, imagining that if I did, I would be transported right there into that movie picture. Jimmy laughed. Veronica laughed, to anybody who saw them, they would have looked like the vision of happiness. Do you believe in one man and one woman together forever? Of course I do. If it's right. It's forever. Then maybe it's true. Maybe there is one perfect person out there, I mean, I know I believe that. I know that I hurt so much when I'm not with you. An unbearable pain. That has to mean something, right? That's love, Jimmy, the pain of love. Jimmy was feeling the pain of love, alright. All he saw was her. All I see is you. And all I see is you Jimmy. And as the sun started to set on a perfect day in a perfect bubble. The question. That question came back, and this time, the dame wanted an answer. You know, you never did say much after my suggestion that night, erasing Cliff permanently cementing us together eternally. At that moment, a reality hit Jimmy. His mood changed and he turned away from her. I can't do it. I can't kill Cliff. Jimmy. Trust me, I want to get you as far away from that son of a bitch as possible, but killing him. I mean, there's got to be another way. There is no other way, Jimmy. The only way to get the money that we need to leave is is to make sure that Cliff is dead. No, I refuse to believe that we still can't be together and run away together. People do it all the time. It won't work, Jimmy. We'll be living on the streets in no time. I love you. With things falling apart. Veronica, worked fast to get Jimmy back on track. Jimmy, you know, I wasn't going to tell you this, I didn't want to frighten you. Veronica, what are you talking about? Jimmy. I'm pregnant. What? I'm having your child, Jimmy, you're going to be a father. A father? We can do this Jimmy. You, me, our child, a family, a family, Jimmy. I know how much you've always wanted to be part of a real family. Jimmy arranged the pieces of information in his head, the thoughts of a future with the woman he loved. I know it's a big step Jimmy, but I know that with our love, we can do anything we want. I love you. I love you so much. And? Jimmy? I'll do it. I'll kill Cliff. Another victory for Veronica and now, well, the deal was sealed. Cliff Smart would have to die. She asked you to kill him? Things are bad Riff. He's beaten her so badly, I mean, you saw the bruises on her face. But killing him? He ain't a good guy. We ain't talking about some churchgoing hero here, we're talking about a man who lays his hands on a woman. Oh, man, you got it bad Jimmy. I mean, loving someone is one thing but bumping off the competition? Well, that's cockeyed. She's pregnant. With a baby? No with a flock of sheep Riff. Jesus Jimmy. A baby? Are you sure it ain't her old mans? It's mine. Her and Cliff don't, you know, practice anymore? She's offered to pay a thousand bucks to anyone who helps. Woah! That's life changing. I need you to help me. I can't do this alone. I don't know Jimmy, murder? We would get the chair if we get caught. We ain't gonna get caught. Why can't she do it herself? I mean the lady looks like she would be with a meat cleaver. The first person, the police suspect is always the partner. This way, Veronica could be at the school or, or out when the murder takes place and nobody will suspect us, because, why would they? This is crazy talk. We're talking about murdering Cliff Smart. Why can't she just leave him? Because he'll take everything and leave her with nothing. She would be out on her ass with no place to call home. Jeez. If Cliff dies, Veronica gets everything, and Cliff is a very wealthy man, even more so when he dies. And then Veronica gets it all. We could do this, I know we could and just think then we can all get the hell out of here. What, the two of us and you new lady? Sure, why not, go to Hollywood, start again? Riff you've been living on the streets, you said it yourself, you can't keep doing what you're doing. This could get you out. Yeah. It's just that easy. And I could get away from my dad, for good. I'm not built for this life. I deserve more. I deserve love. In that moment the boys face a choice. Two sixteen year olds wrestling with life and death. A thousand dollars Riff, a thousand dollars. No, no, I can't do this, I'm sorry, Jimmy. You need to look in a mirror. This isn't you. Riff I ain't got a choice, I gotta defend the woman I love. You're just listening to what she's telling you. How do you know what she's saying is true? What are you trying to say Riff? Oh, come on, Jimmy, you know I like Veronica, she's a fun time with a good heart. But that woman ain't no saint Jimmy. Hey don't disrespect her Riff! Do you know for sure she's pregnant? Do you know that cliff really beats her? Riff, you saw the guy, you saw how angry he got you said that his head nearly exploded. I'm just saying, it's a lot to risk without all the information. Information. Who are you, a detective? I ain't going to say anything, but I can not be involved, and I pray you don't go through this Riff, wait. What, Jimmy? I need your gun. If you ain't gonna help, you can at least do that. I ain't got it on me. I let a friend borrow it. Riff. Damn you Jimmy Flynn for telling me this. Fine. The night you're going to do the deed I'll meet you before and let you borrow it. Thank you. You know, you really are my best friend. Whatever you say Jimmy. I got to go. My future is calling. They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and maybe that's the best way to describe Jimmy's decision. Cliff was now a dead man walking. That night, out clearing his head, Cliff stops dead in his tracks when he sees Riff in front of him warming his hands. You! After a moment Riff's eyes lock on Cliff. It was like a showdown from the Wild West. But who would flinch first? We still have unfinished business, kid. Mr. Smart. It's so different. You look... Glamorous? Older. Well, good. Hopefully people start to see me as a grown-up rather than some dumb kid. Has your mother see your transformation? Oh, she's out. She'll see it when she gets back. I'm sure she'll think it's fine. Have you met your mother? And Vivian, how did you manage to afford this? Oh, Veronica paid, she said, I remind her of her when she was my age. She's always getting me little gifts we're even talking about going to Hollywood together. Hollywood? Vivian, your mother nearly has heart failure every time we go camping, and that's usually in your backyard. Do you think I should go blond? I mean, Veronica says the dark suits me, but I'm not so sure. You do realise that all that comes out your mouth now is about Jimmy's new girlfriend. Girlfriend is a stretch Betty. He's just some teenage crush. Veronica and I, we have a true connection, like on a deeper level, you know. Not really. Plus, it's nice to have grown up conversations for a change. So what am I just some dumb kid? No, you're just different. What we have is our thing and what I have with Veronica, is... Better? Betty. You promised that I wouldn't be replaced by your new glamorous friend, but I hardly see you anymore. Why aren't you happy for me? You know what, you're supposed to be my best friend. When it suits you. I'm changing Betty and you better get used to it or sit down and stay the hell out of my way. Goodbye, Vivian. I know when I'm not wanted. I just didn't think it would be you that didnt want me. Betty! Betty? Kids. My name? Oh, it's Vivian, Vivian Pierce. It's a pleasure to meet you. Did I tell you that I was an actress? Yes, I've starred in several movies. Actually, one critic even called me "dazzling". What on earth have you done to yourself? Mother? Take that stuff off your face. You think going to church looking like some teenage Jezebel is appropriate? It's just make up mother and a new hairdo. Why did you have to be such a drag? And I'm not coming to church. I feel like you're changing right in front of my eyes and I can't reach you. I keep trying but you keep pushing me away. You need to stop worrying about me. You've done your job, mother. Now it's time for me to take over. Vivian, I think it's time I put my foot down. You would have to take it off my throat first mother. You listen to me. No, you listen to me. This constant need to turn me into you is nauseating mother. I don't want to be Vivian Pierce. There's nothing wrong with her. She's so black and white. I want to see the world in color. I wan to be like those ladies who can just click their fingers and get whatever they want. Well, that is not the real world Vivian. No, that is not your world, mother. Look at you. You give up the day you got married. Vivian, your father will... What? Go ahead and call my father. I'm not scared of him. You know, you can't think without a man telling you what to do. If it's not father, it's God. Is this because of that woman? I've seen her around town, you know, your actress friend. Flashy is not attractive on a woman her age. And jealousy is not attractive and a woman of your age. Give me that dress. Give it back mother. This is not you Vivian. Give it back now. What has gotten into you? Keep your hands off of my things, Jean. Please respect that. Vivian. You don't need to be in such a rush to grow up. The world is not always kind to women. Do you think I didn't have dreams? I wanted to open my own sewing shop. Atlantic City, near the boardwalk that's where I dreamed of opening it. But life isn't a dream Vivian, do you think this lady is going to turn you into a star? She's not. That doesn't happen for girls like you. You gave up your dream because you're weak. Good morning, sweetheart. What's all this? Breakfast. You know, now we've got our own little bundle of joy on the way. I thought I ought to learn to do my part around here. Well, crazier things have happened, I suppose. I told my mother. You told your mother? I couldn't wait. It was bursting out of me. I specifically told you not to tell her. It's still early. And as you pointed out, I'm an old shrew now. So this is clearly a delicate pregnancy. Well, I never called you a shrew. Coffee? Thank you. Now, Cliff, please don't go sharing our news with anybody else, especially the boys at work. Don't think I don't know you can out gossip the ladies at the markets. I swear on all the Saints. I can't tell you how excited I am. I can't sleep anymore knowing that the day I dreamt about is so close. It's a new start. We still have time, Cliff. Let's not go wasting all of our joy. We'll have none left for the child. You um, you are excited about our baby aren't you? I can hardly wait. That's what I needed to hear. Now, do you need anything else before I go? Cliff I'm not even showing yet. I think I'm perfectly capable of looking after myself whilst you're at work. After all, I have done it for the past 16 years. OK, baby. Have a good day, Cliff. Oh, and Veronica. Yes, Cliff. You are starting to show a little. It's beautiful. What? Bye baby. The moment Cliff left the room, Veronica jumps up and heads for the phone. Operator, connect me to New York, seven, three, two, four please. Thank you. Is that you? Oh, Jimmy, we have to do this soon. His temper is out of control. My face still stings. He ain't ever going to learn is he? He's just bad, bad to the core. Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, I am scared. I'm scared for the life of our baby. Don't worry. I'm ready when you are. Oh, Jimmy. Every time I hear your voice, it's like the rain clouds lifting. I can see clearly, I can see our future so clearly. When should we do this? Tomorrow night, Jimmy. We have to do this tomorrow night. Tell me you love me. Jimmy, I gotta go. Vivian, well, don't you look like a knockout? I knew that dress would suit you. Oh, thank you Veronica. You look beautiful, too. Why thank you. Now Vivian, what are you doing here? Not that I'm not delighted for your visit, of course. Well, since we didn't meet this week after school, I thought I'd stop by and say hello. That's what friends do, isn't it? They pop by and say hello. And we are friends, aren't we, Veronica? Of course Vivian. In fact, I'm delighted you stopped by. Really? Sure. I mean, I think it's about time we had another acting lesson. Only this time let's do it away from here or or the school. Let's make it more like two girls out on the town. Oh, Mrs. Smart. I would love that. We could go to a bar and well, I could teach you all about how to audition for a movie picture. A drink? In a bar? Sure. Oh, Mrs. Smart. I would love that. But I'm only fifteen. But in this dress, Vivian, you look like a beautiful woman. Every bar in town will want you to light up their establishment and it'll be nice. Just us girls. Just us girls? You and I? A sweet gesture, a blossoming friendship. No, Veronica was lining up alibis like a professional crook. Poor sweet Vivian was caught up in Veronica's web. Mrs. Smart. I would love that. I, I want to learn everything from you. And I will teach you everything that you want to know. I've never had any real friends before. Oh, well, except Betty, and she's well, she's just a kid. I've never really had anybody that truly understands me. Everybody just passed me by. I hope you know how much I value our relationship. Oh, as do I, Vivian. So why don't we say eight thirty tomorrow night? Perhaps you could tell your mother you're staying at a friend's place. My mother doesn't control me. I want to be like you. Strong. Confident. I'm afraid. I don't feel very strong lately. Vivian. What do you mean? My life is is complicated. Mr. Smart? You know, I used to be like you, Vivian. I dreamed of a life in the spotlight. People calling my name surrounded by glamour and most of all, friends. But the day I married Cliff, I think I let a part of that die. No, no, it's still in there. Perhaps. But I think every time Cliff strikes my face, he takes a little more of me. Veronica. You don't need a man. I mean, why do any of us need men, really? They always ruin everything. My father's idea of raising a child is shouting at it when called on by my mother. Maybe... Maybe what sweetheart? Maybe we can move to Hollywood together. Two girls ready to take on the big screen. Oh, Hollywood won't know what hit it. You could leave Cliff. We could just drive there together. Oh, Veronica, imagine. Well, that sounds wonderful, Vivian. A dream, but wonderful. It doesn't have to be. Cliff is so awful to you. Why can't he just drop dead? Oh, Vivian, you shouldn't say such a thing. Well, you'd feel positively awful if something were to happen to him now. I doubt it. Look, Vivian, I need to head into town, so. Oh, oh. Sorry, I'll go. Oh, shall we say. Eight thirty tomorrow. Outside the front of the school? Sure Veronica, I can um, I can hardly wait. Why don't you, uh come sit on my lap, let daddy take care of you. OK, baby, you like that daddy? I do indeed. So How are you going to make your old man happy? Whatever you want me to do, you're paying. Don't talk like that. Don't talk like a whore. OK baby. Jimmy. I thought I told you stay away tonight, I had company. Hi dollface, I'm the company. I'm sorry. I forgot. Are you trying to be lippy with me? Look dad, I've had a tough day. I want to go to bed. Tough day? My kid, sixteen, at high school. Thinks he's had a tough day. You don't even know what a tough day is. You try breaking your back every day at work. Then you can tell me about a tough day. Look, I should go Harvey. Sit down! You're not going anywhere tonight. I'd get out of here if I were you. He likes to use his fists to beat the women around him. Harvey, I'm out of here. Do it, go on. Let me tell you something, Jimmy Flynn. I have protected you from this for years. I will not let you talk that way about me. Your mom was a drunk. She would come home every night starting a fight throwing things, hitting me. That's a lie. She left you outside of church when you were just seven months old. She wanted to go to some bar, but you were in the way. So I came to get you again. Why are you lying? She screwed every man without a single thought of you and me. So, yeah, you may see me as the bad guy, and yeah, I ain't perfect, you know what, I'm still here. I'm still here. No, no, no. You pushed her away. Women lie Jimmy, always remember that, women lie. No dad, that's you. Life is easier without them. I got mine back when she left. And look at you, dad. You're an embarrassment. Spending all the money that you make on booze and whores. I never, ever want to turn out like you. Jimmy. I know love. I've found love, I'd kill for love and I tell you I've never felt more alive. So if you want to fade away, then that's fine. But I ain't going down with you. Do you hear me, old man? I ain't going down with you. (Train Sounds) Ha! Well, you look like you've got the weight of the world on shoulders. Now that I could handle. What's going on? Why aren't you with Jimmy? We're not joined at the hip you know. No, but you seem to share a brain. Haha, you should have been a circus clown. Riff! What happened to your face? I walked into a fist, it's New York City, what are you gonna do. Well, are you OK? Honestly, I'm fine. Vivian, can I ask you something? Sure, as long as it's not asking me on a date. Not a date, fear not. Do you trust Veronica? What do you mean trust her? You know, the thing she says the things about Cliff. He's a monster Riff. Veronica is one of the most honest and trustworthy people I've ever met. Dlal it down, you sound like you run her fan club. Well, Veronica cares about us. I mean, she's more of a mother to me... Yeah, but... Yeah, but nothing Riff Randall. I mean, Veronica has taught me so much. I mean, she stopped and gave me, gave us the time of day. I mean, what other adult wants to listen to us, huh? Like really listen. Oh Vivian, I'm wrestling with something real bad. What are you talking about, Riff? Can I trust you that no matter what I say, it stays between us. This is serious, Vivian, and it isn't some silly, childish thing. I don't know if you've noticed but I've done a lot of growing up recently. So I swear to you, I'll take it to the grave. Veronica has asked Jimmy to kill Cliff. What? Jimmy's asked me to be involved as well. And it's a thousand bucks, which is more money than I ever thought I'd see. But I can't, can I? Woah Riff. Slow down. I know he beats her. At least that's what she says, but murder is just so final, you know, I mean, how could I live with that? When is this supposed to happen? Tomorrow night, he's gone girl crazy. It's like he thinks that if he kills Cliff, Veronica will fall madly in love with him. The whole thing is just hairbrained. Jeez, killing her husband to prove his love for her. Ain't that something. Should I call the police? Should I try to stop him? No, no, no. He'll go to prison Riff. You need to be there and stop him from making a stupid mistake. He won't listen to me. I've already tried. Well, if he doesn't, then go to the police. Just, just stop it. This could ruin his life and Veronicas is if they get caught. We can't allow that to happen Riff. Vivian, you better not be down by the tracks. She is driving me crazy. God, killing Cliff. Riff, you need to stop it. We can't allow Veronica to get hurt. She could get sent away if she gets caught, and that's not the way for her to get away from Cliff. Veronica, you worried about Veronica? I've got to go. I'm sorry. Vivian, but that's not the whole story. I still have more need to say, Vivian! (Train Sounds) It's 7:30 a.m. on the big day, Cliff. Well, Cliff wakes up to a life he could only dream of. Cliff stands and stares at Veronica for a few moments as she prepares breakfast. I want to remember this moment. Oh, Cliff, you startled me. I feel like I'm looking at a new you. What's the occasion? It's just breakfast. I'm already late. I've got a big day, but I can take it to go. You're always on the move. Oh, and Veronica. I always loved you. Whatever happened, I wanted you to know that. Ulnexpectedly, tears form in Veronica's eyes. These ain't no acting tears. Veronica appears moved, moved by Cliffs words. The man she's about to have killed. Veronica. Jimmy, Jimmy you startled me. You having second thoughts? What? No, no Jimmy, it's me and you from now on. Our future begins tonight. When can we leave for Hollywood? A week, maybe two. I just don't want it to look as though I'm fleeing. God, I love you Veronica Smart. So you get here at eight o'clock. Cliff would have just come home from work, you'll catch him off guard. I have an alibi in place. There is nothing that can stand in our way Jimmy. Hey, Sal Salazar's fighting tonight. Why don't you and I have a night in. Watch the fight, have a couple of beers. I can't dad, I've got something I need to do. I'm trying here Jimmy. You have no idea how it feels to be invisible, do you, mother? You know, I sit and watch the movies and see these beautiful women, so full of life, their eyes sparkle like diamonds, and they seem happy. Really happy, and then I look in the mirror and I see, me. Dad. That woman you said you loved, Patricia? What about her? Why didn't you fight for her? How do you know I didn't? Well, did you? How could I Jimmy. She made a choice as soon as she let that other guy into her bed, it was all over. Those women on the screen aren't like that in real life. They have the best makeup people and the best gowns. And I want that. I hate my life. I just want to be beautiful, why is that so wrong? Oh, Vivian you are beautiful. Stop it, mother. Veronica is making me beautiful. Look at me. Maybe. Maybe she made a mistake, got married for the wrong reasons, maybe she was waiting for you to come and save her. Jimmy? What is this all about? You listen to me. You are 15 years old. You haven't even fully blossomed as a woman yet. But I see you, I see you are beautiful and you don't need to hide behind this paint to show that. Nothing that I got to go, Jimmy. Should I be worried about you? What do you mean? Well, this woman, are you serious about her? I've never been more serious about anything in my life. You have to find your own way, you can't just become somebody else. That's not true. Veronica said that many movie stars come from lives like mine. They get to change their name and they're weight and their hair. You know how many girls feel like you? All wanting the same thing. So should I be worried? Worried. About love? No dad you don't need to be worried. I know that she's the one. Veronica... Ahh, Veronica! I don't want to be your enemy and I want you to succeed. But we have few options in life as women, Vivian, so we have to work harder, and that's all I want you to do is work harder. You know, that is the first time you have told me her name. Yeah. Veronica, Veronica. I don't think I know her. Well, apart from your teacher. Well, I am working harder mother, but this time it's for me. Not you. Oh, Vivian. Mother I have to go. Please tell me you're not involved with your teacher. I have to go and find Riff, and if I can't find him I have to find Veronica and stop... Stop what? What are you talking about? I got to go, I won't be late. Jimmy please. Jimmy stop. Jimmy! Riff, Riff? Is that you? So have you got the gun? I'm sorry Jimmy I ain't got it. The guy never gave it me back. And he's vanished. Damn it Riff. I need that. You don't have to go through with this. You really don't have it? Sorry. Oh, well, that's perfect Riff. To hell with it, I still got my bat. Don't do this. You'll ruin your life. If I don't do something, and he hurts my baby how am I supposed to live with that? You think your some kind of mobster now cause you are gonna kill a guy? Oh Riff, go home if you don't want to help, you ain't got to be here. Jimmy. Jimmy, look at me. All the things you could do with your life. I don't need anything else just her and my kid. You're a kid yourself. Jimmy, how are you going to raise a kid? Riff, go home, please. Once you're marked by the devil Jimmy, you can't come back from that. Believe me, I know. Some things are worth it. I'll call the police, Jimmy. No, you won't Riff, that ain't you. Jimmy, please just listen to me. I really needed that gun. Call it off. No way. It just means that I have to do this myself. Like a man. Jimmy please. It's going to be fine Riff. Trust me. In a few hours, all this is over. Dammit Jimmy. I'm sorry. A plan. A man ain't a man without a plan. It's February 13th, just after 7.30 that same evening, silence washes over the neighborhood. A figure seen at the back of the house heads towards the back door. The figure stands in front of it for a moment and then knocks on the door. As the door opens, however. Well, it's not Cliff, It's Veronica, and it's not Jimmy stood there, it's Riff. Riff, what are you doing here? You're early. I have to leave first, and then you come back when Cliff's home. Jesus, I thought Jimmy went through the plan with you. Mrs Smart. Where is Jimmy is he not with you. Is that the gun? I thought you gave that to Jimmy. In fact, I thought you said you didn't want any part of this. Mrs Smart. Now run along Riff, I need to get out of here, go and meet Vivian. Riff? Riff, what are you doing? Aaahh! Yes, Riff. What are you doing? Let's go back to the moment Riff and Cliff came face to face. It was like a showdown in the Wild West, but who would flinch first? We still have unfinished business kid. Mr. Smart. Did you really think I was going to let you get away with that kid? Please Mr Smart, I'm sorry. You think you can jump me, you little punk? It was a mistake, please. I didn't know you were Veronicas husband. You made a joke out of me for the last time. You're nothing, street trash. I should do the world a favour and put you out of your misery. Please don't do this. I'm a good kid, I didn't mean to hurt you. You ain't a good kid Riff. Please, please, please. Oh God, oh God, oh God! So tell me Riff, are you sleeping with my wife? No, no. Why would you think that? I think you are. Now, Is it just you or is it Jimmy as well? You got it all wrong. Ahhh, it's Jimmy. Jimmy's stepping out with your wife, not me, I swear. Give me a Bible and i'll swear on it. Jimmy, that son of a bitch! Please just let me go. I ain't going to cause you any more problems. You give me one damn reason I should. Because I'm just 16. I ain't moved. Your wife has hired Jimmy to murder you. You're lying. No, I ain't, he is supposed to do it this week? She wants your money and Jimmy, I swear to you, I ain't stupid enough to be lying to you right now. No, no, she's having my baby. She said the same thing to Jimmy. Veronica, you've made a joke out of me for the last time. Oh God, what have I done? You just saved your own life kid. Now you're working for me. Do you understand? Everything I tell you to do you do it or I will kill you kid, you and Jimmy. Do you understand me? Yeah, I. Yes, sir. So, she wants to be dead. Aaah. Riff! Riff, look at me, we're friends, why would you do this? Cliff knows Mrs Smart, he knows all about your plan. How, how does he know? I had to tell him he was going to kill me. Why, oh God. What have you done. I've got to do this Mrs Smart. No, no, Riff, don't you see? He's trying to set you up for my murder. He is going to kill me. Do you hear me, he's going to put a bullet in my head and not just mine, Jimmys as well. This way, this way, he said, he is going to leave us alone. There's got to be a way out of this Riff. I'm so sorry. I guess this was my path. You could flee. You could just pretend that you killed me. What about Jimmy? What about him? He loves you. You would just leave him? He's a sweet kid. He's young. I don't want him on the run, he's got the rest of his life ahead of him. Oh God, Mr Smart was right. He said that you didn't love Jimmy because you couldn't love anybody but yourself. And you needed us to play a part in your husband's murder? Riff, no! I wish he'd never met you. I wish none of us had. You ruined everything. Don't you see that he's poisoning your mind against me? You know, the moment my parents died, I knew, I knew that my life would mean nothing, that I would mean nothing. Something like this was inevitable, I guess. No Riff, no! Goodbye Mrs Smart, and may God forgive me. Nooooo! Oh, (Riff Sobbing) It's OK. It's OK. The hard part's done. Cliff, help. Help me. And why would I do that, sweetheart? After you tried to have me killed. I'm sorry. Oh, I know just how sorry you are. My God, all I ever asked from you was for you to love me, and to give me a child, you couldn't even achieve that. Have you ever, really loved me Veronica? I love you. No, no, no, you don't. Those are just the desperate words of a dying woman. I never loved Jimmy. I love you. No, because you lie as often as you breathe baby. You get out, you get out of town. I don't ever want to see you around here again. Oh, and Riff. Leave the gun here, I'll get rid of it, I ain't leaving anything to chance. Now, get out of here! Police. Oh God, please. There was just some crazy kid here. He shot my wife, and then he shot me as well. Please! Oh, God. Oh, God, Veronica. Who did this to you was it him? Jimmy? Is that you? Go... I ain't going anywhere. I won't let anybody hurt you? Take care of you, hold on Veronica. No, no, wake up Veronica, wake up? You can't. You can't die. You can't leave me. Oh God! You see, Jimmy. I always win. I always have and I always will. You killed her. You son of a bitch, you killed her! No you killed her Jimmy. If you want to be a man you've got to be able to take a shot and not miss, and you missed Jimmy, it's never wise to miss. Give my love to Veronica. Wait! Oh God! Oh my God. I thought I told you to go. No, no! You know what your problem is Riff? You care too much. Why would you do that? You promised. Nobody outwits Cliff Smart. Now, I um, I tell the police that you and Jimmy just just burst in and he was screaming at her to leave with him, but no, she wanted to stay with me because she still loves me. But he wouldn't have any of that, so he shot her, but then I shot him, in self defence of course. Jimmy, Jimmy come on. It's too late for him, but you can run. I'm letting you run. You murdered him. He would do anything for her, anything. I'm telling the police. You're trying to set him up. And implicate yourself. You ain't stupid enough for that kid. I should kill you, right now? I don't think your aims that good kid. To hell with you Cliff Smart! That boy attacked my wife! Stop or I'll shoot! As I walked around the crime scene, I saw Veronica's body laid on the floor next to Jimmys. A table next to the chair, had an ashtray on and a half smoked cigarette. Veronica had been caught by surprise, Jimmy's body laid next to her with his eyes wide open with fear. I feel like I died alongside her. Does that sound normal? I notice that Cliff didn't have a single tear in his eye. I feel empty. I've seen the pain etched in the faces of those left behind, as reality dawns on them that death has changed everything for them. This should have been another routine visit, but something about it felt off. And it all came down to Cliff Smart. Now, Mr. Smart, can you tell me if you have any idea why these two young men would want you and your wife killed? Yeah, but I don't want to tarnish the memory of my wife now. She's... Dead? Yeah. I mean, well, you see, she's been spending a lot of time with the kid, Jimmy. I think he'd fallen in love with her. I'd, um, suspected for a while. She used to teach him see, she gave him private acting lessons. And every time I saw him, like I saw the way he looked at her, I mean, I hate to say it, but at times my um, my wife didn't dissuade his flirtations. Were the two, intimate? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I think he thought they'd be together in the future. You know, there was something real strange about this kid Detective. He had something real dark in his eyes. He was clearly, very troubled. Did he say anything when they turned up tonight? He just stormed in in a rage and just kept screaming that Veronica had to go with him. But Veronica just kept saying that he was just a little boy and that she was married and she loved me, but he wouldn't accept it. He just kept screaming his love for her. Eventually he said, if I can't have her, then nobody can. Oh, God. Then he shot her. I mean, I tried to shield it, but he shot me as well. Lucky for me I managed to fall near the drawer where I keep my gun. So I just about managed to let off one shot. Straight through the heart. I just shot. I didn't aim. I just wish I could have saved her. Still no tears, an actor Cliff was not. What about the other boy? Oh, yeah. He didn't say much. I mean, once I'd managed to kill Jimmy, in self-defense, um, he, he, he ran out of the house, and then you fine men turned up. I see. Well, it all seems pretty straightforward to me, but you might want to get that wound looked at. If you ask me, you're very lucky it just grazed you. God must have intervened. Indeed. Vivian, please sit down, I've got something to tell you. Mother, I have to go. Veronica never showed last night and I can't find Riff. I need to make sure that he stops... Stops what? Teenage drama mother. You don't need to know everything. Vivian, please. It's terribly important. I said I have to go. Mrs Smart. She's dead. Vivian, oh Vivian. Jimmy's also dead, and Riff, well, it's not looking good for him, he's in a coma. What? They were murdered last night at her home. They say... What? What do they say? They say that Jimmy was in love with her. She turned him down and Jimmy shot Veronica. Cliff got off one shot and then shot Jimmy dead? No, you're lying, Cliff is dead, Cliff Smart is dead. Cliff's fine. No, you're lying. I don't lie Vivian. How could she be dead, and how could Jimmy kill her, he couldn't, he wouldn't kill her. Sometimes you don't see what's going on even with the people that you're closest to. Riff, oh, God. Riff why didn't you stop it, why did you join in? Oh Vivian, what can I do? He took her from me. From us. Jimmy was obviously very confused. She was my only friend. She was the only person who ever believed in me. That's not true. I've always believed in you. How can she not be here anymore. Oh God mother, it hurts. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK to be sad. Sad? Sad, he took her from me. Oh, no, my head is spinning. God, mother she was my ticket out of here, she was going to make me a star. Let me get you some hot tea. I don't need hot tea. I need to make him pay. Jimmy paid with his life, Vivian. Jimmy? Oh mother, you have no idea what you're talking about. Then talk to me, please. Mother, I need to be alone. Vivian, please. I said, get out, mother, get out, get out, get out. I never want to see you again. Get out, I never want to see you anymore. No. Oh God. No. No. How can he do this. The innocence of youth was lost. The paths they took led to their own downfall. Veronica had destroyed everybody to get what she wanted and if she went to hell, I'm sure even the devil wouldn't recognize her. It's two days later and Cliff was finished playing the grieving husband. In fact, Cliff had a secret of his own. Get over here, baby. I got you a brandy darling just how you like it. God, I'm so grateful to have you at my side. So, Cliff, Veronica never knew. She never knew that we didn't break up? Never had a clue. Went to her grave, none the wiser. I still can't believe she was murdered in this house. Yeah, tough break. I mean, we had our disagreements, but I never wanted her dead, even after all she did. You are handling it so well. It can't be easy for you. The pain will always be there. And that's because you're such a good man, Cliff Smart. And you're going to make a wonderful father to our baby. A little Cliff running around. Or Lana. I'm so grateful you decided against doing your show. Now you're with child. No wife of mine will be burdened with work. You're a housewife and a mother. The greatest job there is. Are you expecting anybody? No. Don't you move, I'll get it. You'll do nothing of the sort. Let me get it. I'll be waiting in the bedroom for you Cliffy. Lana. I ain't going to waste my second chance at love, baby. Cliff reached out for the door and opened it, and so his surprise, he sees Veronica stood there with her back to him. He's taken aback, but a moment later, the woman turns around and it's not Veronica. It's Vivian, dressed in a killer red dress, she looks just like Veronica. What the hell do you want? Why are you dressed like that? Well, Cliffy, I have a message for you. Who is it, sweetheart? Well what the hell kind of message would you have for me? It's simple, Cliffy. It's from Veronica. Veronica's dead. Yes Cliffy, and she's real mad about it. LANA!! Aaaahhhhh!!! Vivian would be arrested and sent to a mental institution where she would remain for years. Vivian Pierce, this sweet girl with a bright future ahead of her had now vanished. All that was left, a broken shell of a girl who soul seems to have been completely removed from her body. Her mother and loyal friend will be her only visitors. And even then, Jean never gets to truly see her daughter. It would be a week later, when Riff opened his eyes, and his mouth. Yeah, he told us the whole sordid story. It was only at that moment that everything fell into place. The affair, the murder plot, thedouble cross. It was something that even the best Hollywood writers ccoudn't have dreamed up. Riff would be sent to jail for 10 years for the murder of Veronica Smart. But he's using the time to better himself, to learn himself a trade. God, please let one positive come from this tragedy. In all my years, I had never seen a more twisted or tragic story from one teenage boys fantasy and one manipulative woman's motives came the murders of Jimmy Flynn, Cliff Smart and Veronica Smart. The tragedy wouldn't end there, however, the implications were far and wide. It would be too much for Harvey. He will blame himself for how hard he had been towards his son, a charge he was sadly guilty of. So on a cold winter night, Harvey Flynn took a large drink from his bottle of whiskey, picks up his pistol, aimed it at his head and. Well, he didn't pull the trigger, stopping himself becoming the latest victim of this tragedy. As for me, well, I left the force. The case lingered over every move I made. This ain't like the movies, the detective doesn't always get his man. So now I write pulp detective novels like this one you witnessed, it's cathartic in a way, it helps me release the nightmares I see in my sleep to the page. It helps me to put them to bed for good. Now it's your nightmare. You see, the city is a scary place. Nobody is what they seem. Evil doesn't always hide around dark corners, and innocence doesn't automatically mean innocent. People are far more complex than that. In this case, they showed me the horrific acts that people can do to one another over a beautiful but unworthy woman. See, nobody is truly bad or good, right or wrong. Human existence is far more complicated than that. And that's the scariest thing of all, because you can never see it coming. This is my city, and I prided myself on solving every case that came across my desk. Well, apart from one, the case of Veronica Smart, a woman who destroyed everything that got in her way.
