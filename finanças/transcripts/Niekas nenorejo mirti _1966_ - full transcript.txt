NOBODY WANTED TO DIE Secretary, help me please. No... I won't go on my own. We will find him, it's not a needle but Lokys. Lokys... Lokys! What is he doing? He's learning to bend his back. He's just had a surgery. German bullet was found in his backbone. How are you, dude? I'm fine! Listen, why we always meet in hospitals? - Either you, or me. - Or both of us! Bronius... Bronius, your father was killed... yesterday night, by nationalists. Leave me! What about mother? No. Darling, bring my clothes. Lieutenant, do you want to leave without surgeon's permission? My clothes! Bye. - Take a seat. - I can't sit. So you'll stand? I'll lie down, there should be some space. As you wish. Donatas! Donatas! Father is gone. OK. Mykolas! Father was killed. Wait. Kids... you can go home. No lessons tomorrow. Did anyone threaten father? He got a letter once. If you continue governing, we'll shot you down, Aitvaras. Hello. Don't you remember me? We used to play together before the war. You used to visit us on Easter. Find me dry trousers. Bronius... Bronius. Have you seen him? Yes, mother. Oh Lord, he is so dead... I've never thought he can look like this. Who is poorer than our father today? He'll find eternal peace two metres down the red soil. But he left four sons. Why do you say, he left... you are my sons. Call the priest for funeral. No, mother. Father always preferred tavern to church. Bronius, you've always been my favourite, you're my first son. You can't imagine how I suffered before I gave a birth to you. Call the priest, Bronius. No. - God bless you. - Thank you. Marcinkus used to help father. Eternal rest grant unto him. Chairman's position is free now. I say... chairman's position is free now. No, brothers. Governance is needed anyway. Mr. Teacher knows... I used to help partisans to fight Germans as much as I could. Maybe I didn't have much, but this is other topic. - Yes, he helped us. - So why don't you help now? It's obvious. So how will we live? I'll plough the soil while I have a horse. - Where is Pocius' cottage? - Over there. He won't go, even if you pay him. Poor jokes, this year five chairmen were killed. I prefer horse tail to angel's face. Sir, don't even ask. No, no, no. What about you? Pocius, you're old soldier. What will you say? Me? Chairman... instead of your father. For what? How didn't I please the government? Is it punishment? You're our man. Everyone here is yours. You wouldn't talk to us then. You must take care of your people, Lokys. Where is your son? We're asking you, where's your son? - Hi, Juozapas. - Hi. Where is Vaitkus? - Son? - Yes, son. Over there. Get out of here! Display your fists at your own home! - Pagans! - Ona! Politics is not women's business. Pagans! Let them talk if they have what to talk about. Pagans! - Are you with murderers, Donatas? - I was for a year. - Do you know Aitvaras? - No, I don't. I was released under amnesty law, I have documents. I know, you're not the first! Who shot my father? I don't know. Find out! Go and find out, I give you three days for that! How will you catch him? He'll hide in forest. He won't disappear anywhere, he won't leave his father, right? Won't you? Father... Always father! Enough. We suffered enough. If you don't bring the news in three days, I'll shoot everyone! Relatives and non-relatives! Eye for an eye! Secretary ordered to take Vaitkus. But didn't tell either father or son. I'll take both and let him choose which one he wants. Take son. I wanted to take both. - I said son, don't you hear? - As you wish. Give me something to drink. Your female? Mine, why? Hot. So what, is it bad? No smell of gunpowder left. But shot from short distance. Possibly from windowsill. Can I take it? Yes. Your order, comrade secretary. Well... Let's get acquainted. What is your relationship with Soviet governance? Normal. I didn't kill anyone, I was amnestied. I know that. Tell me, why did you collaborate with Aitvaras? - It was convenient at that time. - At what time? Why did you leave the forest? It's obvious. What is obvious? I was sorry for father... and for myself. And for father. Where do you work? Randomly, in the mill or by the road... Here is no work, and we're not allowed to work in town. We'll give you work. Come here. Come, come. Take a seat. Sit, sit. So now... you are the chairman of our village. Take a stamp. You'll get a good salary. If you cheat, we'll punish you. So it's our deal. No! I won't be able to do that! We will help you. People won't listen to me. It will depend on you. Only on you. By the way I will leave you three policemen. Enough? Enough. You can go. Go. Go, go! Hi, Lokys! Hi. What are your further plans? - Hello. - Hi. - Do you want me to stay here? - At least for a while. We can't leave them unguarded. Whom? Dead ones? Yes. As well as alive ones. Good afternoon. What kind of soldier am I now? Motionless target for bullets. You're not a soldier anymore, to be fair. What to be fair about? You said it by your self. - Maybe you want to settle in town? - Maybe in the hospital? I will stay here. I will plough the soil. You're right. They can't stay unguarded. You should try to talk to your brothers. You can't do anything on your own. Sure. You can't joke with Aitvaras. Don't try to seek for revenge. Revenge is poor adviser. Alive! Free! The only one... my beloved one! You've never called me beloved one. - Did anyone beat you? - Yes... everyone who wasn't lazy! When you don't see, you don't suffer. My beloved man! I need to lie down. I'm chosen to be the chairman. What are you laughing at? What? Couldn't you refuse? - They forced you! - No, it was my will. I was dreaming for it all my life. Since early age I was a son of a poor mute cobbler. What? And I knew that I won't have another father. Poor father. You should see... how he's talking... in his dreams. No... no! Vodka, please. Congratulations, chairman. Don't waste your time. What is said won't be forgotten. Three days! Idiot. You're such an idiot. You didn't have any rights. You could respect at least the dead! Is our father's place worth of bandits? Don't shout. He advised us. Who? Father?! Peasants didn't have rest for two years already. Kids don't go to school anymore. We need a chairman alive. At least to manage duties. - There's no products in town. - You'll be fine without products! Mr. Teacher! Marcinkus. Praised be Jesus Christ. Forever. Amen. Here you are. Traitor... if you plough the soil for Soviets... we will shoot you like a dog. It's the last warning for you. Aitvaras. Almost without mistakes. - Who brought that? - A postman. He found it in the post office, without a stamp on the envelope. He took a rouble from my woman because, as he said, letters are sent without stamps. So what should I do now? - Explain him, you're government. - Bandit Vaitkus is government. What shall I do now? If I get such letters without stamps. Why are you silent? Should I plough or not? Don't plough. If you don't want, don't plough. - Will you give me bread then? - No. You see... We will give you a rifle. I shat... on your rifle, to be honest. We don't have anything else. I've never had a rifle in my hands. Brothers, brothers, brothers... don't leave the village... we won't see the end for tears. Wait. Pranas... take the toys and stay tonight in his house. Everyone won't fit here anyway. - Hello. - Good afternoon. - Hi. - Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hello! Oh, yes, yes... You didn't recognize me? - How did you sleep? - Very well, thanks. For your own sake, you'd better change the overnight place. One night here, another there. Thanks, even before I rarely slept at home. Donatas! Bronius! Mother is calling you. Oh God! Go... our tears won't change anything. Do you have kids? - Why do you ask? - Just curious... We don't have a school but we could make the first class for little ones. You're a chairman now, think of this. OK. You wear a Komsomol badge on a very bumpy place. What do you offer, gentleman? To wear a flag? Where do you go for parties on Saturdays? No one is dancing. We are scared of woodmen. - Aldona, could you help us? - What could I do? You could work in the office. - Oh, not with him. - As an assistant. Chairman! I found you an assistant. This girl finished school, she is ours, won't steal anything. You'll have a secretary. OK. How is our agreement, chairman? One day has already passed. See you! - If you need, call the army! - OK. Excuse me! Which way are you going? Straight, via oak woodland. In your case, I would go on the top. You see... Specialists should be trusted. What I'm in charge for, Mr. Chairman? We don't have cows anymore! I can't milk neighbour's buck. Bandits took my cows in spring. We had only two of them. We used to call one Mother-in-law... the other one was Champion. Only a little heifer remained for us. We don't have milk for ourselves... thanks God, we don't have children yet. Did the chairman know that? Definitely, he did! I told everyone... your daddy knew, and the previous chairman... and the one before the previous, everyone knew, I told everyone! So I say, the bandits came and took my lovely cows. You're lying! In spring... when we came to you... you told us that damn Soviets took your cows. 'We don't have milk for ourselves' 'thanks God, we don't have kids'- you said. Oh God... you wanted to kill me... you took my bacon... You gave it by yourself. Did I have a choice? No one is blaming you... for bacon. What about his debt? He must pay it back in a year... with milk from three cows. Let him actually live without milk. We won't punish you. But you know... What belongs to God, that belongs to God... but what belongs to state, please, return to state. You'll return milk from three cows for a year. Thanks for you two. Don't. - Pociuviene, please. - Thank you. Give me a certificate, that child was born. Write down... we indicate... what a tiny baby! Looks like someone let the air out of him. What's the name of junior Pocius? Same as father's, there's no need to fantasize. Jurgis Pocius. No feathers, no wings... it takes so short for such a little to turn into a man. Jurgis Pocius was born. I heard you'll take the flour. Yes. Where are the records? Aitvaras... asked to wait. For three days. He said that bread has finished in a forest. And vodka. How much does he need? All of it. - So much? It will rot. - Let it rot. He said, let it rot, but Soviets won't get any. Boss, I'm stopping. The eldest is asking when Lokiai are leaving. I don't know. We can't let them leave the village. If they came, they should remain in their homeland. He also asked... why policemen stay in the village? For my security. Don't worry... you're ours. Don't you remember... Viesaitis' son-in-law... Apuokas. He killed... the chairman. Why should I know that? You have your business, I have mine. Two wars have passed, but nothing has changed here. Something changed. As a kid I used to come here with my father. I've calculated everything. Ten bags are missing. Means, they were stolen. There is no magic. When can we take them? Wait for a couple of days, until we finish everything. You're a governor, you have to decide. Tomorrow! If we want to take flour tomorrow... we have to get horses ready. Horses are ready. We have to decide who will lead the carriage. I've decided. Me. Only. Why only you? It's unnecessary risk. Calculate, who hasn't given the grain and how much. Risk is the same for one as for ten. Listen Lokys... I am a chairman now... I will try to do everything on my own. If I need help, I'll ask you, but now... Thank you. Sure, that's you choice. We would like to have the chairman alive. Me too. Well then, goodnight. Goodnight. I've finished. I've finished. OK. Goodbye. Having a rest? Did I interrupt you? Goodnight. I'll come with you. I feel safer on my own. Did he harass you? Leave me. OK. Don't act silly, because I'll shake your soul out! Eh, you... - You woke everyone up. - What did you come for? I don't want anyone to find you here. The miller met the eldest... - Got it? - Yes. The eldest told me to ask you... if you are taking flour tomorrow. Yes. Who is leading the carriage? Me. Refuse it. Let Lokiai to lead it. All four of them. The Eldest ordered to take all of them at once... and flour... ...and Lokiai. We can't hunt them down by one. - You got it? - Yes. Who is Aitvaras? I don't know. Are you working? Yes. Who shot? Me. I saw a mirage. I don't feel well. Why? I'm not sure, some illness. Maybe I shouldn't go with a carriage? - Who will go then? - You. Me? The four of you. OK. We will go. Get out! It was easy to loose head. We haven't agreed yet on which way Lokiai should take. Let all brothers meet in the mill... then we'll show them the way. Only one carriage? The rest are behind, letting horses to drink by the wade. Do you need help? Take it, take it. Don't shoot before all four are here. Sergeant! Sergeant! Brothers... brothers! Who are you? Yours. Take the rifle. Let's try. You see... it's finished. Kuzia! Kuzia, Kuzia... Jonas! Jonas! Jonas... - Jonas? - No... Just calm down. Jonas! Barzda... the chief. Before we thought that he was Aitvaras. We set him free... Bastard. He's hardly been here. Aitvaras doesn't like publicity. Apuokas. If trust the miller... What happened? What's going on? Get up. Get up! Wait... until Aitvaras find out about your betrayal... you'll get... Are you injured? No... Do you want to help us? No, one traitor is enough for you... Your choice... Let's go. Go! - Bronius. - What? You're now the eldest, don't let Donatas to cuddle Aldona. He has a pile of women in town, he'll just spoil her. He is adult now, you can't forbid it. Talk to Aldona. You also want, eh? OK, I'll talk to her, pass this to secretary in town. Motiejus, take care of yourself... don't fool around in town. I know those silky ladies... they will do everything for a rouble. Listen Jonas... go to school and tell them that I can't come. For God's sake... without fantasies, OK? Don't frighten them, or tell anything scary. Tell the headmaster... The third day is over. Have you forgotten? It's the third day. Apuokas, the one, who is sitting in the carriage. He killed your father. Get him out of here! Who will witness? The miller. He's dead, who else? Himself, Apuokas. Are you scared of Aitvaras? Yes. Listen, what if I go with a carriage to town? Just leave without telling anyone, okay? Jonas will also be safer. Jonas? True, it will be safer, go! - Not too early to have fun? - So what, should I cry? Did you call me? How to tell you something in a diplomatic way... Jonas loves you... He sees me everyday, eyes got used to it. - How long you've been in our house? - A year, since I was left alone. My father was the first chairman. I heard of this... So what were we talking about? Eyes got used to see me. Whose eyes? Oh yeah... It means we are responsible for you while you live in our house. Jonas asked me to talk to you... - Are you also responsible for me? - Possibly... Does it hurt? When we were kids, we used to play together... you used to bring green, unripe apples from this garden... and afterwards we used to have a stomach ache. - Where were you wounded? - By Riga. - Was it scary? - No, no... We thought Germans will fight till the end. But they weren't the same Germans anymore. Whole battalions were giving up. It was spring... the end of war... no one wanted to die. My brothers died there. Forgive me. No, you forgive me. I want to take care of you. Do you hear me? Because my back is hurting? No. Then means eyes are getting used to me. Run! - Run! - No. What are you waiting for? You killed my father! No... no... no! Yes, get up! Run! In the name of the Father, and of the Son... Donatas! Did you kill him? - No. - It's uncertain. I heard you killed him! Yes, I did. You will see, you will be punished for that... It isn't same as seducing girls. Jonas... take a seat. Sing father's song. The old mother was walking in the woods and she found her son's grave under the oaks. Get up, get up my son, enough for you to sleep father's manor and sorrel horses are waiting for you. God bless you. Thanks. Did you hear that? Shooting in the forest. Who are you with, saint Juozapas? With Lithuanians or Soviets? I am with my woman. So am I bad politician? Finished drinking? Now go there, where you came from. - Come here. - What do you want? You'll hide me, do you understand? Then you'll go to millers widow... and tell her that I'm alive... and free. OK, I will. Also, tell that we are betrayed. - Who is the traitor? - Non of your business! Traitor... chairman is the traitor. Tell it's Vaitkus, do you understand? What? Are you deaf or what? - I understood. - Go then! To millers widow. Tell her to tell the chief... that I'm free and waiting for his commands. I'm going then. Are you alone? Alone. I'm going. Stop! Do you know what is waiting for you if you betray me? I know. There are twigs... don't let the fire die away. I miss you... I want you to love me whole day... every hour. You look handsome when you're laughing. More! Why are you with Lokiai now? Everyone will curse you. I want peace. There won't be peace... if you don't kiss me. Not like this, fool! Having fun? Don't even think of being jealous. - Seems like we need to talk. - No need for that! No need. Enjoy... human life is short enough. You don't have patience, do you? Why didn't he start fighting? Is it something new for him? Do you think he hasn't seen us before? Is he... is he actually saint? Yes. Yes. My husband... first husband... died in East Prussia. Didn't you know him? Pranas. Only to say hello. It's a pity. You don't know what sort of man he was. Because of him I left my home and parents... And came to this cursed land. I was born here. I grew up by Nemunas. Don't you know Raudoné? Oh God, oh God... If you called me... I would leave everything for the second time to follow you. I was born here. How did that saint appear here? Juozapas. You shouldn't... you shouldn't have gone with Lokiai. You shouldn't have done it. Later, he stopped the carriage... and took the prisoner to the woods. And then? He shot in the woods... Puff! Why do you think that the one who shot was Lokys? Because another one didn't have a gun. Certainly. What do you know, what have you seen? Nothing. Haven't you heard the shot? I haven't heard anything. - Maybe you remember something? - Nothing at all. Marcinkus, what will you say? What should I say? Was he killed or not? It's not my business. That's all. Well, you can go. Good bye. Donatas! What can you say? If I tell you that I let him go to woods... will you believe me? No. Listen, Mykolas, what will we do with Donatas Lokys? He must be punished! People won't trust you! You can't unlawfully fight the injustice! Donatas... let's think you did everything unconsciously... Unconsciously! If I meet him for the second time, I'll kill him straight away. Snake. Shall I continue writing? Enough. Mykolas... Take him to the granary... and lock him properly. Secretary will come and then we will see. Let's go. Don't be silly, I won't go anywhere. Yes you will! With escort. Through the entire village! So people know that in front of the law everyone is equal. And you, communist, as well. Let's go. Beware, I actually let him go. The rifle cheated on me. So it goes... chairman. Listen... Lokys. We need army. Aitvaras will seek for revenge for the mill. I don't have army... I don't. All those rifles, which we took from the mill... we should give to peasants, into reliable hands. Vaitkus... didn't you have any brothers? No. Mother left my father when I was a kid. Maybe it's good. Hi! Hello, hello. You prefer vodka or debates? Both of them. Vodka is fresh. And what is the topic for debates? People say, that you give the rifles away. Already? Well... then I'll speak straight. Brothers! Isn't it time to catch Aitvaras and finish him off? At once. I know your hands are blistered from plough... not used to hold the rifle, but what should we do then? Who do you think will... live instead of you? We will have to do that on our own. Doesn't matter we want or not, we have to do that on our own! Isn't it shameful in front of wives, who pray at night... Can't we protect our homes? Protect our rules? What are you silent about? Shall we sing Lithuanian song? Brothers? The horse was living in the pastures dapple gray in the pastures. I am watching at my girl resting on her arms. My girl my lily. Either you watching or not watching, I won't be yours. You see, she doesn't agree with our song. Leave us, chairman. Not with fingers, with palm. Stop teaching me. I was in German prison during the war. Don't shoot a man! Lokys... Do you know what I'm thinking? Go on. If you hadn't kicked into Aitvaras ass in the mill... no one would have taken any of these rifles. Lithuanians don't like risk. Give me a favour, saint Juozapas... Arrange for me a meeting with Aitvaras. Me? Yes, you. You should be visited by ones and by others... Everyone is looking for vodka, ones and others. - I can't refuse them. - You see... - Arrange the meeting. - For negotiations? Maybe. What's the advantage for you? Less blood. He will hardly... agree. So what does he want? OK, he will kill me, it's not the first time for me then ten more, but he won't kill everyone. Women will bear more kids than he has bullets. You can't ban women from that pleasure. He wants to defeat Soviet authority even Hitler didn't manage to do that. Maybe he expects people to sing song about him. - Those songs will be sad then. - Yes, sad... What if... the man doesn't see any other way? His blindness is costly for everyone. Saint Juozapas, arrange for me a meeting with Aitvaras. - The sooner the better. - Lokys... when should we expect Aitvaras? Hopefully tonight. Oh God! Jonas... you'll lie by the window. Don't close the shutters. If you can, don't sleep. - Oh God! - Mikas... Yes. I'll sleep in the garden. Mother, give something to cover myself. Mother. Oh Lord... We two will sleep here. Turn away. You're meant to look out the window. Would you like to be my daughter-in-law? I love... How do you know? I want him to live. I caress his hands... I caress... caress. He is such a bear. Foolishness. Do you want to have children with Bronius? I haven't thought of this. So think then. If you want to have his children, means you love him, get married. I was lucky with the eldest Lokys. All kids were boys. If I started all over again, I would give birth to ten. Talk to Bronius, tell him to stay here and not to be scared... I will look after grandchildren. Oh Lord, forgive me my sins which oppress my children... and don't let germinate the seeds of evil, which I sowed in their hearts. Oh Lord... Mykolas, what about Donatas? Will you take him to town? I don't know. Mother... how many Lithuanians left? We slaughter each other worse than Germans. Is it his choice, Mykolas? Wasn't our father first to be harmed? I understand, mother. Fight between classes, I understand that, mother! But in heart it's disgusting! Maybe my heart is the enemy of my class? Darling, don't be ashamed of kindness. - Donatas... - Yes, mother. Do you need anything? Thank you, mother. Do you want to go out for a while? No, mother. Donatas, why did you kill that person in the woods? Enough of sins and evil in our house... Listen to your mother, can't you control yourself? I am thinking of that, mother. Bronius, you brother is repenting. He didn't want to shoot that person. That's not true, mother, I didn't say that! You see, he hasn't said that. What about you... never... my son? I am a soldier, but I shoot only when it's necessary. For what, for what? For our house... Aldona is gone. I know. Listen... are you angry with us? Donatas... it has to be like this, for everyone's sake. Maybe. Stop! I will shoot! Donatas, let's go! Wait... I've stolen something. Keys... stamp. Listen... I must return this back, true? True. Just wait a little bit! Donatas! I wanted to be... I wanted to be one of yours. Honest... useful... All the Lokiai... Marcinkus... Budnikas... Pocius. The Mute... father of the traitor. Chief, I punched your nose yesterday... You'll pay off that later. - Where's mother? - In the cellar. Bronius, where is Donatas?! Run! Lokys! Run! No! Run! Kneel down. Kneel down as I did! Kneel down! Fuck you! Please, have mercy on me! Have mercy! Where is your man gone? Where's Marcinkus? He went to town. I warned your man... as Lithuanian... but he went with the Lokiai. Happens... not good. Vaitkus' father, the mute cobbler, was hanged at night. What about the Lokiai? Beat her... until she says. What do you have to say? I don't know. Let's play. This is not going to happen! What are you lying, you slut! Jesus, Jesus... Lie down! Here you are, in Lithuanian way! Motiejus! What do you want, him to sit on you like this? He's dead... Secretary! Listen! - What do you want? - They are shooting in the village! So what? If they shoot, means they are alive. Listen! Woman, what's going on there? You don't know... how strong the pain is. You don't know... No, I don't. Aitvaras was German military officer. Is it true that Aitvaras had two heads? No. Aitvaras doesn't exist! He's from fairytales. Let's go, let's go... Cock-a-doodle-do! THE END
