[Marshall] Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. -What I love about it: the scares. -[growls] That was me, Marshall, a year ago. And those are my two best friends, Gilbert… And I have a hunch this is a bad idea. -[Marshall] …and Amy. -Future investigative reporter. [Marshall] Last year was the craziest Halloween ever. -[screams] -We accidentally woke up -an ancient Egyptian mummy. -[roars] We all thought he was gonna be totally mean and evil. -Turns out he was just a big sweetheart. -[groans] I nicknamed him Harold. Marshall? He became our friend. A really awesome friend. -[burps] -[groans] But then our pal, Buzzy, figured out that Harold only had three days to live. He had to be back in his coffin before midnight on the third day or… -He could turn to dust. -[groans] So we said our goodbyes and got him back to the museum just in the nick of time, where he could be with the love of his life for all eternity. So how are we gonna top Halloween this year? No idea. But tag along. I dare you. [chuckles] [crow cawing] [Amy] I really think we're lost. [Marshall] Yeah, we are definitely lost. And this place is really creepy. [Gilbert] Well, if we spot anything weird, don't worry. I'm ready to film it. [Marshall] And that's supposed to make me feel better? [Amy] Come on, guys. Let's keep going. [snarling] [Amy] What was that? [Marshall] Nothing. I hope. [thudding, growling] [Amy] That was definitely not nothing. [Marshall] It's time to go. Like, now. [Amy] Shh. Listen. It stopped. -[snarling] -[Gilbert, Marshall gasp] -[roars] -[children scream] -[werewolf howls] -[Amy screams] -[Gilbert] Which way should we go? -[scarecrow laughs] [growls, laughs] -[screaming] -[chuckles, grunts] [Marshall] Run! -[children gasp] -[monsters growling] -[zombie] Brains! -[Gilbert screams] -[scarecrow laughing] -[Amy screams] -[monsters growling] -[children screaming] [growling stops] [announcer] The haunted corn maze is now closed. -Please proceed to the exit. -[zombies sighing] [zombie 1] Finally. I gotta get to my shift at Burger Shack. -See you. -Yeah. I'm gonna stop by later. [scarecrow] Sounds good. [shudders] They look even scarier in the light than in the dark. Not that I was afraid or anything. [chuckles] [howling] [Gilbert] All right, fam, so as you can see, I, Gutsy Gilbert, have easily conquered the Walgrove Horror Corn Maze. Until next time, stay gutsy! [chuckling] Guys, that was awesome. I'm really happy we did this together. -[Amy] Me too. -[Gilbert] Me three. I wish they weren't closing so we could do it again. Yeah, Gilbert, I still can't believe you used to be afraid of everything, and now you review scary things for the school paper. This maze was up there. I give it three screams for sure. I mean, between his videos and my stories, we can't be stopped. And this one is gonna be great. It's even better than the 24-hour horror-thon. [growling on screen] Or the bungee jump. [screaming] Or that time I had to eat… [groans] I can't even say it. [scoffs] Yeah, look, Gil, I think you've proven that you can handle being scared. You know you don't have to keep doing this, right? I do so have to keep doing this. Like you said, I was the town scaredy-cat for years. People need to know that's the old me. They definitely do. The Gutsy Gilbert videos are, like, the most watched thing on the school paper's website. But also, it's fun. Marsh, you always said being scared is fun. Remember? "Face your fears. We're big world people." Yeah, look, I know, but not all the time. You can take breaks. You're not getting one this weekend. Speaking of, I still need to pack. Don't want to show up at your dad's wedding looking anything less than smashing. And because Pops and his fiancé, Carl, are getting married on Halloween, they're calling it -the "Hallowedding!" -The "Hallowedding!" Amy, I don't even know how you put this together. Really? I don't know, it's a lot of work. The best part is that Pop and Carl put me in charge of the welcome party the night before. It will be Halloween themed, of course, with spooky treats, everyone in costume, the works. And I'm gonna call it "Shocktail Hour." -Ooh. I like that. -Yeah. And you two are gonna help me make it happen. This is gonna be a busy vacation. I'm just glad we built in time to go see Harold. Of course. Harold and Rose's exhibit is at the Rockport Museum of Natural History for a few more weeks, so works out great. Who's Rose? [both] Oh. We gave Harold's girlfriend a name. -After my aunt Rosie. -Yeah. Cool. It's just, nobody told me. Anyway, I really want to wake up Harold. I miss him so much. We all do. But they have to rest side by side in order to be together in the afterlife. You know, gotta respect that eternal slumber. [chuckles] I'll see you guys at school tomorrow. -Secret newspaper handshake? -Secret newspaper handshake. [Gilbert] Oh, oh. Oh, oh. -[growls] -[screams] [both] Oh, oh, oh, oh! [chuckling] You two know it's not secret if you announce it, right? We know we can trust you. [chuckles] -Good night. -Good night. [sighs] Stupid internship. They got me working the night shift. Not even getting paid. [sighs] Man, I could barely afford this sandwich. -[meatball thuds] -My meatball! No! [groans] It's really under there. [groans] [grunting] Okay. [grunting, straining] [grunts, chuckles] Gotcha! Ugh. Hmm, 25-second rule. Still good. Come to papa. About to tear this up. Mm-hmm. I got all three of my meatballs back, baby. [groans] [grunting] -[yelps] -[growls] [snickers] Okay. Come on, y'all. Where are the hidden cameras, everybody? [stammers] Esteban, is that you? [growls] Okay, dummy mummy, I got something for you. [growls] [groans, growls] You're not Esteban. No heartbeat. You're not alive. [yelps] What are you doing? No, wait! Hello, Sobek, O Great One. [roars] How may I do your bidding? You wish to spend eternity resting by the love of your life. And get revenge on your best friend who betrayed you. [roars] And you will stop at nothing to make it happen. No problemo. Uh, what's wrong? Did you lose something? Your cell phone? Wallet? Your keys? [grunts] [grunts] [growls] Ah. That's you. Oh, now I know what you were looking for. You already have your assistant, but you need your staff. [grunts] Did His Excellency get my joke? [groans] It's a homonym. A "staff" has dual meanings as a-- Okay. [bell rings] Hey, fam. -No, no signs of a break-in. -Interesting. Buzzy just got a new crate of fake eyeballs down at the shop. Want to go see if anything looks good? No, we just got something weird. I have alerts set up to report any mummy-related activity. After everything that went down with Harold last year, I decided to keep close tabs on the mummy world. You know, just to make sure he's not in danger. Anyway, this was today's news. [Marshall] "Mummy disappears from museum." Balderston's, like, a billion miles away from Rockport. What does this have to do with us? Because we get nervous when Egyptian antiquities disappear. After all, some of our best friends are Egyptian antiquities. Wait, you guys don't think someone's gonna try to steal Harold, do you? Because last time I checked, Killbot and Ravensworth are still in jail. Yeah, we were just talking about that. Yeah, but the thing is, there were no external signs of a break-in. Then it must have been an inside job, right? Maybe. We'll keep an eye on this. But for now, Marshall, we will see you tomorrow bright and early for the big voyage to Rockport. Come on, Amy. Let's finish cutting down the corn maze video. Content never sleeps! You've got it, Gutsy. All right. See you guys tomorrow. -[Amy] Bye. -[Gilbert] See you. -[Marshall on video] …definitely lost. -This is gonna be great. You know what else is great? My face right here. -[yelps] Which way should we go? -[laughing] -[growling] -Yeah, can you get the time stamp? -Yeah. -Okay. [intern] Worry not, Sobek, we will find our way back to that cursed Route 18. Got it. We are unlost. [grunts] Oh. Oh, but of course. Your majestic legs need room to stretch. So there's gonna be a switch, and then that's gonna put you-- -[grunts] -Okay, I got it. Here we go. -[groans] -Sorry about that. That-- I'm so sorry. It's gotta be broken. Okay. It shouldn't-- I don't get what it-- Nope. It's gotta be my left hand. It-- It should not be doing that! I just gotta tune the-- A thousand million "kajillion" pardons, O Magnificent One. [growls] Anyway, now that you are comfy cozy, I am pleased to announce that I have located your majestic, bejeweled staff. It is at the classy private estate of antiquities collector, Jonathan Manchester Wilcox, and we are headed there right now. [grunts] And then we will travel on to Rockport, where your sworn enemy will be vanquished, and you will lie beside your one true love for all eternity. [gauge beeping] Also we should get gas. I don't suppose Your Amazingness has a few bucks to kick in? -[roars] -Just checking. -[grunts] -Oh. You just take a little nappy. I'll get us there. [exhaust backfires] ♪ Have yourself a happy Halloween ♪ It's pretty cool our parents let you chaperone this weekend, Buzzy. Yeah, I'm hype. I love a good wedding. Or a bad wedding. Mostly, I love free snacks. -That makes two of us. -[Buzzy chuckles] How about you, Amy? You pumped? -Amy? -"Sobek"… Gesundheit? More info came out about the mummy that vanished from the museum. Apparently, he's from the same century as Harold and Rose, and his name is Sobek. Ugh. He looks bad. Cool eye patch though. [Amy] Whoa. Apparently he wasn't always bad, because it says here that he was Harold's best friend. This website has a translation of his diary. Sobek was an adviser to Rose's family and was the one person Harold confided in about his forbidden love for Rose. Whoa. They must have been best, best friends. But it looks like Sobek was also in love with Rose. And he was so upset that Rose rejected him, he became Harold's bitter rival. Sobek swore that if it took him a thousand lifetimes, he would get his revenge. Whoa. That is so many lifetimes. So, a mummy that Harold and Rose personally knew has been stolen? I don't like that. I don't like any of this. Our friends could be in danger. I'm just glad we're going to the museum today. Do you guys see this? Whoa. Welcome to Rockport. [Marshall chuckles] Amy, y'all really do go all out for scary season, huh? -[child 1] Yay! -[child 2] So cool! Amy, if this is Rockport, I don't think I'm ever leaving. Whoa. [chuckles] Awesome! That's our hotel. [Marshall] No way. [Buzzy] This is a dream come true. This is awesome. Geez, Marshall. This place is like being inside your head. -I know! I may never leave. -[Amy chuckles] -Pop! Carl! [laughs] -[Pop] Amy! Good to see you, girl. -So glad you're here. -Hey, Pop, wouldn't miss it for anything. -Oh, and about the chocolate fountain-- -Don't worry. We've got it under control. Excuse me. I may not be as exciting as a chocolate fountain, but I think maybe I should get a hug? Hi, Carl. Happy wedding weekend. Oh, and, uh, Pop and Carl, this is Buzzy, Gilbert and Marshall. Oh, of course. -Gutsy Gilbert! -Gutsy Gilbert! Amy's told us a bunch about you. Can't wait to see the corn maze video. Oh! Thank you, guys. Always nice to meet a fan. And Marshall, we're looking forward to getting to know you -a little better this weekend too. -Awesome. I have a million things to tell you about Shocktail Hour. And we can't wait to hear all of them. But first, you still good to go pick up the rings from the jewelers? They said they'd be done with the engraving-- 6:30 p.m. Bueller's Jewelers, North Main Street. We'll be there. -[Carl sighs] -I don't know what we'd do without you. We'd love it if you could hang on to them until the wedding. We have a lot to keep track of. I will guard them with my life. I promise. -This weekend is going to be amazing. -[chuckles] Yeah. Well, now that you're here, it's gonna be better than amazing. Buzzy, we checked you in. There's your room key. -Nice earrings. -Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [all laugh] -Okay, troops, let's move out. -[Gilbert] All right. [Carl sighs] That is an incredible kid. -Yeah, she takes after me. -[chuckles] [Gilbert] Wow, Amy. There's already so much going on. It's pretty amazing you're taking on this party. Yeah, don't you want to chill out and enjoy the weekend? This is my gift to them. I'm a kid. I can't buy them a honeymoon vacation or whatever. But I can throw them an amazing party. And I promise you, it will be unforgettable. [Buzzy] This is it. -[gasps] Oh, my God! -[Gilbert, Amy] Wow. [Gilbert] So, this is all for us? I'm definitely never leaving. [machine beeping] Me and Buzzy will take that bedroom. You guys take the other. [both giggle] Ooh. And I'll take the snack bar. And if we get tired of that, we can order room service with this thing. This place is the best. The toilet has blue water and Bluetooth. [gasps] -Why does a toilet need Bluetooth? -I don't know. I just know I can never live without one again. [Bueller] Here you are. Your fathers' wedding rings. Well, shape of the ring box was a unique thing to custom order. And I think it looks great. These are perfect. Thank you. Guys, check these out. Guys? We found a few more pictures of that Sobek guy. He has an amulet exactly like Harold and Rose's, only it's red. I've never seen a jewel that red. It's almost scary. Mind if I take a look? Of course. Red jasper. [inhales sharply] Nasty stuff. Jewels are my business, and I do love them all. But wherever red jasper goes, there's always trouble. Wait, really? You were talking about a mummy? Well, in ancient Egypt, the color red represented chaos and destruction. Anybody buried with that… was planning on being up to no good for eternity. If it took him a thousand lifetimes, Sobek swore he'd get his revenge. And his amulet is just like Harold and Rose's, except evil. And there was no sign of a break-in. Guys, I don't think Sobek was stolen. I think he was revived. That means we need to protect Harold and Rose. And that means we need to wake them up as soon as possible. Let's go. -Okay. Go, go, go! -[Amy] Thank you. [Gilbert] Thank you. Revived? Everyone ready? Okay. The museum is officially closed. -Everyone clear on the plan? -One special delivery, coming right up. [grunts] [door buzzes] Can I help you? Yeah, I got a late delivery of clothing and textile samples for the Roman exhibit? -You can just sign for it. -Oh, no, no, no. My orders were to bring it to the exhibit directly. -I don't have any record of that. -That's right. My boss, she talked to her. And who's "her"? Delia Henson? The curator? Your boss? Be quick about it. Can do. -[Marshall] Are we there yet? -[Buzzy] Shh. We're almost there. Here we go. [grunting] Come on! Okay, guys. We're here. [Marshall] Come on. Let's go. Hey, guys. It's me, Marshall. It's so good to see you. How are we gonna bring them back to life if the moonlight's all the way over there? I already thought of that. I brought mirrors. Mirrors? Mirrors. We will bring the moonlight to the mummies. Oh. Okay. [Amy] Okay. [clears throat] Come on, moonlight. Come on, moonlight! -Harold! -[gasps] -[groaning] -Hey. [grunting] Shh. We don't want the guard to hear us. [distant groaning] -[Marshall] Shh, shh. Shh, shh. -[groaning continues] I missed you, big guy. Oh! Okay, too tight, buddy. -[Amy] Hi, Harold. -[Buzzy] Hi, Harold. -[groans] -Hey, Harold. Come on. We need to wake up Rose now. [groaning] [sighs] [both grunting] Hi, Rose. Guys, we gotta get the "mummy-quins." Come on! -You like these? -[both gasp] We'll put them in your place so no one will notice you're gone. I think I did a pretty good job making them look like you on such short notice. Hello? Okay-- Hurry, hurry! We have to finish the mummy-quins and get out of here! -[Harold groaning] -[Buzzy straining] Too heavy. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, Harold. We need you to be the getaway driver. -[straining] -[Marshall] Where are we going? I think there's an exit at the loading dock in the back. That way. [Harold grunting] -[Marshall] Harold, not so loud. -[Harold grunts] Hmm. [Amy] Harold, make a right at the bottom of this ramp. [groans] -Whoa. Hey, Harold! Harold! -[Gilbert] Harold? [all screaming] No! Lean! You know, I used to always think museums were boring. Not anymore. [distant screaming] Did you hear something? -Look out! -[Marshall] We're gonna crash! [roaring] [Marshall] Huh? Huh? [groans] [Amy] Harold. That was awesome! [laughs] Hmm. [Buzzy] Move! Hurry! Oh, wow! We did it! Well, I defy anyone to pull off a smoother antiquities-related heist tonight. Okay, before we go any further, most mightiest of Sobeks, I have to ask, why do you need this scepter so badly? [roars] Good enough for me. [clears throat] Now, uh, there will probably be private security. My plan: we order a whole bunch of sushi to their door, and then when they're distracted, we sneak in. What do you think of my plan? [gasps] I don't think he liked my plan. Wait for me, most amazing Sobek. [Sobek groans] -[grunts] -[alarm blaring] [groaning] [roars] -[statue clangs] -Wait up. Hey. Hey! You stop right there. [Sobek growls] Whoo-hoo! -You've been "Sobek'ed." -[security groans] [intern] That was a good one. Next stop, the Rockport Museum, where your love and sworn enemy lie in wait for you. [Marshall] Sobek escaped. See? [Harold growls] -We think he's awake like you. -[Harold grumbles] And we're worried he might be coming for you two. So, we woke you up. [Harold grunts] FYI, the water pressure here-- amazing. [Harold, Rose grunt] Oh, no, no, no. That's just Buzzy. Don't let the mud mask fool you. Oh, this? No, no, no, no. It-- it's just an algae mask. Self-care. [yawns] Oh, man, it has been a night. I think it's time for all of us to hit the sack. -[Harold grumbling] -Yeah. It's our bedtime. [grumbling] [Rose grunts] -[Harold grunts] -Oh, um, do we need to get a couple more cots? Or… [Harold groaning, sighs] Note to self, use flashlight for late-night bathroom breaks. [owl hooting] -[Harold snoring] -[electronic ping] -[grunts, grumbling] -[electronic pinging] Couldn't sleep. Thought pizza might help. [laughs, groans] [growling] Hold on, big guy. I have to order it first. See? Okay, so I'm going to get one… -[Harold grunts] -…and then I just hit "order." [grumbling] It'll be here soon, buddy. [grunts] [Marshall] Here you go. -[Harold grumbles] -[Marshall chuckles] -[Harold growls, chewing, moaning] -Yeah, so things are good, I guess. My mom and her dude, Ted, are still going strong. Ted turned out to be pretty cool. -He's probably going to move in soon. -[growls] Yeah. I mean, that's it. Everything's-- everything's fine. [growls] [sighs] All right. It's just… Amy and Gilbert have become real buds, you know? I mean, they're always off at the school paper or doing his videos. The three of us used to do everything, and, uh, now I just feel… left out. That's all. [growls] I'm okay. It's just-- it's really good to see you again. I missed you. -[grumbles, growling] -Oh! I almost forgot. -[chewing] -Got your favorite. [chewing] [growls] [grumbling, gulping] [growls] -[belches] -[gags] -[grumbling, chuckling] -Yeah. It's good to have you back. [chuckles, growls] Hey, Amy, where do you want to hang these lights up? Around the sides, along with those other decorations on the table. -Yeah. -[Amy] Thanks. Hey, Buzz, can I snag you for a sec? Buzz of course. [Amy] Do you have any spooky decorations like spiders and cobwebs? -Let me go see what I got in the hearse. -Great. [chuckles] Uh, shouldn't one of us run up to the suite to go check on the mums? I'm really worried about them. -Eh, it'll be fine. -Yeah, they're in a locked hotel room. -Couldn't be safer. -O-- okay, but-- [both] Don't worry. [both chuckle] [grunts] [grumbling] [growls] [Harold grunts, growling] -[grumbling] -[Rose] Hmm. [grumbling] -[electronic ping] -[Harold grunts] [both grumbling] -[electronic pinging] -[Rose chuckles] [Harold chuckles, grunts] [Harold grumbling] -[electronic pinging] -[Rose] Uh-huh. I'm seeing spiders, but I'm not seeing spiderwebs. Huh, I could've sworn that-- Well, don't worry, because I have a list on my phone of every Halloween store in town. We'll be swimming in cobwebs before we know it. [Buzzy] Let's go. [knocking] Room service. -[Harold grunting] -[attendant chuckles] Oh! Is it, uh, just the two of you? [grunts] Strong, silent types, I see. -Love the costumes, by the way. -[Harold groans] All right, let's load it up. -[Harold grumbling] -Hup, one, two, three. Hup. [Harold, Rose moaning] Well, if that's all you need-- And please don't answer that. I'll just… -Hmm? -[chuckles] -You know. Ah! Oh! -[Harold grunts] [chuckles] Okay, well, there's an automatic gratuity added anyway, so enjoy. Let's go. -[Harold grunts] -[Rose growls] [Harold grunting] [both growl] -[Harold moans, grunting] -[Rose grumbles] [both groaning, chuckling] [growls, grunting] -Mmm? -[Rose growling] -[Harold grunting] -[Rose grumbling, laughing] [roars] [both gulping] [belching] [laughing] ["Gonna Make It Happen" playing] ♪ Breaking all the rules It feels so good ♪ ♪ Thinking to myself ♪ [cell phone chimes] [cell phone beeps] ♪ Are you really going home Yeah, yeah ♪ Hey, Gil, can you give me a hand with these decorations?

I told Amy how I thought it should go, and she put it together. -When? -I don't think she sleeps. You know, you two are really killing it with those videos. But between that and the paper, I feel like… [sighs] …the three of us barely have time to hang out. What do you mean? You were with us the other night at the corn maze, and we're all here now.

[Harold grunts] -[Rose sighs] -[Harold exhales, growls] [electronic ping] [both groan] [announcer] Welcome to the Karlov Hotel and to Rockport, a city on the move. Rockport loves Halloween, and today kicks off our three-day celebration in the heart of historic downtown: the Rockport Halloween Festival. The Rockport Halloween Festival is a short walk or a shorter drive from the hotel, and it has something for everyone. Games and costume contests for the kids, shopping for Mom and Dad. So come on down. It's all here in Rockport, your Halloween headquarters. -Welcome to the Karlov Hotel and… -[Rose grunting] -Rockport loves Halloween… -[grunting continues] [Harold groans] Good news and bad news. Good news, we found cobwebs and a bunch of other things on sale. Bad news, there's a Sobek update. [Marshall] Oh, no. [Amy] According to the news, last night, Wilcox Estate in Haverbrook, a priceless Egyptian scepter was stolen -by a giant man in a mummy costume. -Oh, no. -And his goon. -[Marshall] What? The guard said they thought it was a Halloween prank at first, but the mummy guy had the strength of 20 men. Sobek. -Bad news. -Understatement. Wait a minute. Hold on. What does he want with the scepter? No idea, but if he wanted it that bad, the reason can't be good. Take a look at this. This is where Sobek escaped from, and this is where the scepter was stolen, which is on the way to Rockport, so that means… Sobek is on his way here. At least Harold and Rose are safe in the room. Sobek could already be in Rockport. Come on, let's go! [Harold grunts] [grunting] -[Rose grumbling] -[Harold groaning] [Rose grunts, groans] -[groans] Ooh! -[Harold] Whoo! -No, we have to make sure-- -Hold up. Why is the door open? [gasps] [announcer] …kicks off our three-day celebration -in the heart of historic downtown… -[Amy] Oh, no. [Marshall] What happened in here? -Where's Harold and Rose? -Check the rooms. -Rose? -Harold? -Rose? -[Buzzy sighs] They're not in here. [stammers] What did I tell you? We shouldn't have left them. This is bad. Really bad. Um, but we'll find them. I know this town inside and out, and it won't take long. -She's right, Marshall. -And what are we going to do? Just drive around and shout their names? It could be too late already. There's an evil mummy on the loose who has sworn revenge on our friends, who are missing, and we have no idea where to start looking. I mean, we could start with this huge downtown Halloween fair. Of course. I got so distracted by everything, I completely forgot about the Rockport Halloween Festival. Grab your jackets and let's go. [Marshall] Go, go, go. Here they are. [grunts] [grunts] [grunting] -What's wrong, most esteemed Sobek? -[growls] [hollow thudding] -[growls] -Are you sure that's not them? Maybe they went to bed on an empty stomach. [roars] [stammers] Impostors! -They have escaped. -[growls] Do not worry. They couldn't have gone far. [Harold, Rose grumbling] -[Sobek growls] -[intern] Do not fret. Although I have absolutely no idea where to start looking, I am certain a solution will present itself… Well, that was easy. There they are. [Sobek growling] [roars] Okay, yeah, that's pretty scary, dude. I guess. [stammers] A thousand pardons, apathetic adolescents. My friend here mistook you for two other mummy associates. -Whatever. -Maybe your buddies are already there? Where? Uh, at the Rockport Halloween Festival, dude. All of us Hallo-weirdos, we're headed there. Then that is where we will go. You probably want to talk to that cop first. No! -Hey, I'm on a mission from Sobek. -[mummies chuckle] -He's royalty. -[officer] Yeah, yeah. [Amy] Hey, Buzz. Park on the side street. It's close to the festival, and it's free. Free? Say no more.

[Sobek grunts] [Marshall] Hurry, they're coming! [roaring] I am so sorry. Um, I'm sure the kids went-- Oh! What's that? "Bueller's Jewelers." Maybe one of those lousy kids dropped this. -[growling] -We will pay them a visit tomorrow. In the meantime, what do you feel about tacos? [growls, grunts] We-- we could do cinnamon rolls instead. [Gilbert] What was that? That must be why he wanted the staff so bad. Chaos and destruction. -[Marshall] And who was that guy with him? -Some creep. -A big creep. -So, what do we do now? We go back to the hotel and don't let these two out of our sight. Well, that's a good start. I hope. Right here, Most Amazing One. [Sobek grunting] Well, sir, that's quite the mummy costume. Such realistic touches with the scepter and the amulet, and-- What gem is that? It's, uh… It's red jasper. -Hello, my dear merchant of gems. -[Sobek grunts] Tell us who these rings belong to, and we can keep things around here from getting any redder. Sure. Uh… Oh, these are for a couple of local fellas who are getting married tomorrow. I'll just, uh-- I'll give 'em a call. Uh, we would like to bring it to them ourselves. I'm not really in the habit of giving out my customers' inf-- [Sobek growls, roars] Karlov Hotel! The wedding party is staying at the Karlov Hotel! [jeweler groans] Excellent. Let us away. Ow! [sighs] -[Gilbert] How's it looking? -[Buzzy] Almost there. -[sighs] You look perfect, Drac. -[roars] -You don't look too bad yourself. -Thank you. -[Buzzy laughs] -[Harold grunts] Chocolate for the fountain has been delivered, check. Decorations are all hung, check. -Evil mummy is still on the loose, check. -[sighs] [Amy] It's okay. They don't know where we are. Uh, Amy, you gotta get into your costume. The party's gonna start soon. Oh, um, it'll only take me a second to put on. I just gotta go over everything one last time. The only big issue is that we're down a couple of cater-waiters, but I think I have a fix for that. Buzzy, you're sharing a room with Amy. Does she sleep? Yeah. But she does sleep-talk about her to-do list. Loudly. The rings! The rings! I've lost my dads' rings. I said I would guard them with my life. I can't find them. Wait. When was the last time you saw them? Today? This morning? This afternoon? I don't know! I-- Okay. Don't worry, Amy. I know this looks bad, but we're here to help. -Come on, fam. Let's get looking. -[Marshall] Yeah. [Harold grunting] [grunts] [Amy sighs] I give up. It's useless, they're gone. We'll find them. I promise. Okay, we can keep looking later, but for now, let's focus on your favorite thing. Planning. You said you had a fix for the missing cater-waiters? Yeah. Okay, I do. Harold and Rose can work the popcorn and cotton candy booths. What? That's a terrible idea. They're supposed to be laying low. We have to keep an eye on them. And we need to be at the party, so they need to be at the party. Besides, I don't want to lose anything else this weekend. I think it's a great idea, Amy. Big surprise. Okay, it's go time. Um, I'll be right down. It'll just take me a second to get into costume. [Buzzy] Let's go. -[Harold grunts] -I'm fine, Harold. Let's just get this over with.

The spooky stars of Shocktail Hour themselves. -This is… -Wonderful. Thanks, guys. I just wanted it to be perfect for the both of you. The chocolate cauldron has serious wow factor.

Oh, melodious Sobek. They are here, and they're throwing a party just down the hall, which we are gonna turn into a surprise party. Except I don't think they're gonna like their present very much. [cackles] Attention, everyone. Uh, thank you. -Thank you all for coming. -[Harold grunts] [Amy] We are excited to have you at the wedding tomorrow, and I wanted to welcome you here tonight to celebrate the men of the hour, Pop and-- [Sobek growls] Sobek. [Marshall] Sobek? [both exclaim] How did they find us? [groans] [grunts] [screaming] -[Buzzy gasps] -[Amy gasps] Amy!

Go, go, go. -[groaning] [Harold grunting] Harold! [growls] -[Marshall] No! Harold! -[groaning] -[growls] -No. -[groans] -No. -[grunting] -I told them. I told them this was a bad idea! [groaning] [Pop] Amy, please. [knocking] [Pop] We just want to make sure you're okay. I'm not. Amy. Amy, come on. Open the door. Come on, Amy, please. We're not mad. I have basically single-handedly ruined your wedding. [Amy] The party was a disaster. Everyone thinks I'm an idiot. Also, I lost your rings. [sighs] And I let down Harold and Rose. -Amy-- -Please just go away! Leave me alone! Can you keep an eye on her? Of course. Go get some rest. We'll try again tomorrow. -[door closes] -What do we do? I don't know. -[door opens] -[Harold groans] Hey, Harold. [groaning] We'll find her, I promise. [groans] I mean, we're all… so sorry. Oh, you're sorry? Well, I'm sorry too. I'm sorry you and Amy never listen to me, ever! Marshall, this doesn't-- Because if you did, they would be safe in our room like I said. -Marshall, we didn't-- -No! Harold and Rose were depending on us, and we let them down. Gilbert, you and Amy let them down. Because you two are in your own little world. A little world that I'm not a part of, and I don't wanna be. As far as I'm concerned, you two can stay there! [groans] [groans] [sniffs, sobs] [groaning] Marshall, I-- [sighs] Maybe give him some space. -[grunts] -[Marshall sobs] Right this way, O Awesome One. [grunting] Yes, mighty Sobek. This storage facility will be perfect for you and your love's final place of rest. [moans] And I found a way that your coffins will be eternally undisturbed. [grunts] It will be many, many hours of hard work for us to make this the perfect tomb. -But together-- -[roars] I, of course. I mean, it will be many, many hours of hard work for me. And it will be done well before your beloved must return to her coffin at midnight tomorrow. [grunts] Hey, there you are. We were just coming to the room to find you. Happy Halloween. Sure. Not a happy "Hallowedding" though. I'm surprised you even want to talk to me. I'm so, so sorry, guys. I just wanted to give you guys an unforgettable party. Well, I promise you nobody will forget it. I mean, it was supposed to start your whole marriage off on the right foot. -And now there can't even be a wedding. -[Pop sighs] The thing is, Amy, we love each other, and you, very much. So we're already on the right foot. A few mess-ups can't change that. That's true. When things went badly yesterday, we could feel your heart break. You put the weight of the world on your shoulders, and you didn't need to. Your happiness is more important to us than a cocktail hour or a perfect wedding. Well, that's good because you can't have a perfect wedding without rings. Says who? Not too long ago we couldn't get married at all. Now we can get married any way we want. We don't need rings. We have each other, and we have you. Everything else is just gravy. [chuckles] Come here. [Pop sighs] Thanks, guys. I should probably get back to my friends. -Okay. -Go. You think any of that got through? Probably not, but it will. That weird guy said, "She will now rest side by side with Sobek, and they will be forever undisturbed." [Buzzy] Where would that be? No clue. Maybe someplace with Egyptian coffins that aren't out in the open. Everybody knows most museums keep their extra exhibits in a warehouse or something. They do for the one at home. Yeah, they totally do. [door opens] Hey. I heard you guys last night. I, uh-- I have to go do some stuff in the other room. -Harold? You wanna join me? -[grunts] [grunts] -[grunting] -I'll explain later. Come on. Look, guys, I-I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry I said what I said, but I also meant it. I mean, you two kind of froze me out like we were never even friends. Wow, Marshall. We had no idea. Yeah, I-- Why didn't you say something to us? I didn't know how, and besides, you two were always off at the paper or making videos or just not hanging out with me. Anyways, I just wanted to get that off my chest. You know what, Marshall? -You're right. -I am? Yeah, we messed up. Yeah, I guess we got so excited about doing the Gutsy videos for the school paper, we weren't really thinking about anything else. Yeah, and we didn't mean to make you feel bad, but now we know we did. And I'm really sorry. Yeah. Sorry, Marsh. [sighs] Apology accepted. -All right! -[grunting] Not that we were eavesdropping or anything. Okay, let's bring Amy up to speed on what we figured out. Okay. Gilbert thinks Sobek took Rose someplace where they can be in side-by-side coffins undisturbed. And Marshall thinks we should be looking for a museum warehouse -or something like that. -[Amy] Mmm. Yes. I did a story on the Rockport Museum storage facility a few years ago. It's a warehouse with a huge Egyptian collection about a half hour from here. Nice work, you two. You make a good team. You all do. [grunts] It's noon now, and the wedding starts at 5:00. All we have to do between then and now is defeat a super-powerful evil mummy, who's got a laser scepter. -Piece of cake. -[Amy] Come on. Let's go. O great and powerful Sobek, though it took many hours and possibly years off my life, I am pleased to announce that your tomb is complete. [groans] This is where you and your love shall rest for eternity, -side by side, as the gods intended. -[groans] A blessed couple such as yourselves will, of course, need round-the-clock protection. Which is why I included two guards to watch over you. And finally, your coffins and accoutrements are in this crate, which I will seal around you. And then you will be hidden forever, never to be found. -At least I hope not. For my sake. -[growls] Does His Awesomeness approve? [growls] He loves it. Yes! [chuckles] Okay. -[Harold grunting] -[Amy] This way. Shh! Shh! [intern] But that's why I put him next to her. I hear voices. [intern] …every week. I'll come in. I'll bring tacos. I think it's coming from over there. Come on. [intern] Chicken nuggets. I don't-- You haven't tried those things. That's gonna be amazing. Uh, you're gonna be sealed away forever, and what is a better send-off than the world's freshest fruit? -Rose's amulet. -[intern] You know what they say, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." Even when you're dead. [laughs] -[grunts] -Don't worry, big guy. We'll get her back. [intern] Can't stress how many hours I put into this. What's the plan? Okay, we need to get Sobek's doofy guy out of the way. That should be pretty easy. And once we do that, we can revive Rose. What's Sobek doing while we're doing that? -Because he's right there. -Good point. We'll grab the amulet. Then one of us can distract Sobek. While that's happening, we'll revive Rose. Great. Couldn't be easier. And after we do all of that, Harold, you think you and Rose -can take down Sobek? -[grunts] -I'm good with this. -Yeah, me too. -Yeah. -[grunts] Uh, I don't know. Sobek's really big and strong and powerful. And… Gil, you okay? Yeah, I'm just… [sighs] I'm fine. Guys. I think I have an idea. [Amy] Shh! Ow! Wh-- I-Is someone there? [grunts] Okay. You can't hide from-- Ah, well, that was easy. [shouts] What the-- You gotta-- -[Harold growls] -[intern screams] -[strains] -It's not your color. [strains] -[sighs] All right, guys, let's head in. -[Amy] Okay. [Buzzy] Let's go. [muffled grunting] [Sobek groans] Okay, which one of us is going to distract Sobek? [straining] Okay, well, don't everybody volunteer at once. Sobek. Help! Well, that guy volunteered, I guess. -[roars] -[children gasp] [intern] These ropes are cutting off my circulation! Okay. We only have a second till Sobek gets back. Let's go get Rose. [intern] I need your mighty strength to assist me, Sobek! Hey. Sobek. I have this mostly under control, but if you could untie these ropes, that would be amazing. [gasps] [Harold grunting] [Buzzy whispers] There we go. [gasps] [Buzzy] Hey. It's okay. It's okay. You're safe. -[Rose panting] -[Harold grunting] It's okay. It's just us. Intruder alert. Your sworn enemy and those rotten kids are here! [groans] [growls] [Amy] Guys, come on. We gotta go. [Sobek growls] [all gasp] [Marshall] Whoa! Okay, okay. Listen, Mr. Sobek, if you can just let us go, we won't tell anyone. -No one needs to know. -[roars] [children scream] Ladies and gentlemen, meet the members of Sobek's court. [guards growling] -[Marshall] Oh, no. -[Buzzy gasps] -[Marshall] Oh, no, no, no. -[Gilbert screams] [grunts] Bring Sobek's beloved to us. Bring the rest of them to their doom. -[Harold, Rose grunting] -[guards roaring] [children screaming] [grunting] Watch out! [groans] -Harold! -[grunting, panting] -[Harold groans] -[growls] -[growls] -[groans] Go get those brats. [Amy] Guys, we gotta get out of here. [Marshall] Come on. Go, go, go, go, go! No. No. Stay back. [roars] -Dead end! -Oh, no. We've been corn-mazed! -Help! Get away from me! -[groans] -Where's Gilbert? -[Marshall] Oh, no. Come on, Gilbert. Stay gutsy. Stay gutsy. -[growls] -[Gilbert] Whoa! [yelps] [screams] -[Amy] Gilbert! -What are you doing? [Amy] Get down. [grunting] -No. No. -No, Rose. [Sobek grunts] -Bring her to us. -[gasps] Hey, dummy mummies. [mummies grunt] -Up here! -What? -Gilbert! -[Gilbert] Harold! -[grunts] -Get Rose out of the way. [grunts, screams] -[grunts] -Gilbert! [Marshall] No! [Gilbert screams] [Harold roaring] Gilbert! [all gasp] -Yeah! -[laughing] [Amy] Gilbert! [cheers] Yeah, Gilbert! -I did it. I did it! -[Amy laughing] [Amy, Marshall] Yeah! -[Amy] Gilbert! -[Buzzy] Yeah! Yes! -[roars] -[all gasp] -[roars] -[children scream] [Marshall] Go, go, go. You. Sobek trusted you. You were his best friend. And what did you do? You stole the love of his life. And now you all must pay. [groaning] [Rose grunts, sobs] [both grunting] The majestic Sobek is picking up what you are putting down. And he has decided if he cannot have you, his true love, then he will destroy you both. Guys, I have an idea. These shields are like mirrors. Like at the Rockport Museum with the moonlight. -What? -Trust me. Please. [roars] [grunts] [roars] Sobek. No! -We did it! -[laughs] -Hey, it's over. -[Harold groans] -Yay! You did it! -[all laughing] [Marshall] We did it! Yeah! [Gilbert] We did it, guys! Uh, excuse me. Well, almost. W-W-Was I hypnotized by an evil mummy and forced to carry out his diabolical bidding as his mind-controlled lackey? -Yeah, that seems about right. -Uh-huh. [bracelet clatters] [Rose, Harold moaning] Why are they so sad? Beats me. He was the worst. I mean, he was. He was a monster. But before all of that, the three of them were friends. And he was Harold's best friend. Well, I'm glad that's never gonna happen to the three of us. Agreed. I think we're gonna be okay. Yeah. Gilbert? I gotta say something. I'm not… I'm not gutsy. I mean, what are you talking about? You were amazing up there. -[Amy] Yeah. -I was scared. I was scared the whole time. Look, I mean, everyone gets scared, but scared isn't the opposite of brave. You can be both. I like that. Up high. [phone chiming] People, we are 45 minutes out from the Hallowedding. Wedding? Wedding. Oh. I think I might have something that belongs to you. [gasps] My dads' rings. Thank you. Larry. I'm Larry. [Harold grunts] Hi. Uh-- Sorry again about all of that evil stuff. [growls] All is forgiven. [chuckles] Do you wanna join us? -I couldn't possibly join the-- -I could use a dance partner. Sure. [groaning] Oh. These? Um, I know you guys probably didn't have wedding ceremonies in ancient Egypt, but this is a part of ours. These rings are something we use as a symbol of our love and connection. And people exchange them to show that they are giving their love from the heart to the other. [grunting] [Amy] Yeah, that's right. Exchanging them is like giving the other person a little piece of you to carry around with them at all times. Yeah. You get it. [Harold groaning] [Buzzy panting] "Quickiddy" quick. Change into your Sunday wedding finery fast, got it? -[children] Got it. -I might need to borrow some clothes. I've been wearing this for a while. [sniffs] Yeah, he is a little whiffy. Buzzy, can you run into my dads' room and grab something for him? -Yes. Come on. -[Amy] Okay. Let's go. -[Marshall] Go, go, go. -Go, go, go, go, go. [Buzzy] All right, we got here with ten minutes to spare. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of Michael and Carl. Now, some of you might be wondering, "A wedding on Halloween?" -[Harold grunts] -[minister] But when you think about it, it makes sense. Michael and Carl, as it turns out, first met on Halloween two years ago. They discovered they shared a love of old horror movies, and then they discovered they shared a love of so much more. I don't have to tell you the love they shared was for each other. Now, normally, this is where we exchange the rings, -but our couple have chosen to forgo-- -Um… Actually… we can still forgo it, but I do happen to have them. You're full of surprises, aren't you? I'm done after this, I promise. I know we could have done this without the rings. And it would have been just as amazing. Because you have each other, and we have each other. Everything else is just gravy. [minister] All right. Now that we have the rings, we can commence with the exchange and finalize the union between Michael and Carl. -Of course. -[minister] Carl, repeat after me? -"I, Carl Ramone"… -Anything for a friend. I, Carl Ramone… …"do solemnly swear to take this man, Michael Vann"… …do solemnly swear to take this man, Michael Vann… [minister] …"as my lawfully wedded husband, forever and ever." [Carl] …as my lawfully wedded husband, forever and ever. [minister] And now, Michael. "I, Michael Vann"… I, Michael Vann… …"do solemnly swear to take this man, Carl Ramone"… [Pop] …do solemnly swear to take this man, Carl Ramone… [minister] …"as my lawfully wedded husband, forever and ever." [Pop] …as my lawfully wedded husband, forever and ever. I now pronounce you husbands! [guests] Whoo!
