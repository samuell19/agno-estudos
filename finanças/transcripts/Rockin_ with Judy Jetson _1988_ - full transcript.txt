I'm not even going to think about Sky Rocker for one week. Judy, Judy! Have you heard? Sky Rocker's coming into town for a surprise concert tonight. Sky Rocker! Ooh! That didn't take long. He'll be arriving at Grand Central Space Station any minute. What are we waiting for? Come on, Iona. Maybe I can get him to look at my song. Oh, well. I tried. Quark, Quasar, come here at once!

Let me tell. Do it. Do it, Zappy. [saxophone music] [all cheering] So you see, ever since the Megamma 12 was hidden on Zooma-Zooma-- It's been up to us to keep it outta evil hands. Hey! Who's tellin' the story anyway? And if that evil Felonia ever nabs it she'll burn out the whole universe. [saxophone music] Bummer. That's wonderful. - It is? - Yes. It means Sky didn't change my lyrics. It was all a big mix up. Oh, mix up is right. Now we're in big trouble. Don't worry, you'll be safe if you just chill out with us for a while.

What's the matter? Can't take the heat? This is terrible. I have found what we are looking for, Commander Comsat. Quickly then we must return. Ya-ah! [all screaming] [all laughing] [zoomies crying] Those horrible monsters! Yeah, they really burn me up. [saxophone music] [weeping] Why were they so mean to us? Some people just don't wanna be friends, Zippy. [instrumental music] Hey, wait a minute. I wouldn't put me in jail if I were you. My father is a very influential person. Sure, sure. Move along, buddy. You can't keep me here. thud What's the charge? "Disturbing the peace, resisting arrest, destruction of property and impersonating a teenager." It'll never stand up in court. Tell it to the judge, buddy. Hey! You can't do this to me, I know my rights. We gave your one phone call. I can't help it if my wife's a sound sleeper. (male #2) 'Smile.' click click swish clink clink This is an outrage. thud You won't hear the end of this. I'll tell every reporter in town. Rhoda Starlet here, celebrity reporter. See? Now the truth shall be told. Excuse me. Are you George Jetson? Yes. And I'd just like to say-- (Rhoda) 'You heard it here first, people.' The father of superstar songwriter Judy Jetson is a good-for-nothing jailbird. Wait a minute. This is all a big mistake. Do you deny that you were arrested for disturbing the peace? No. I mean, yes. But I wasn't-- Aha, he admits it. (George on screen) Wait a minute. I'm a respectable businessman. I'm George Jetson. Jetson? What's he doing in jail? Oh, the poor misguided man. I knew he'd come to no good. But I'm not a criminal. I work for Spacely Sprockets. Oh. Dragging my company's name through the mud. Now he's gone too far. Where is your daughter, Mr. Jetson? Uh, I don't know. I, uh.. Even her own father doesn't know where she is. (Rhoda) 'Could Judy Jetson have eloped with Sky Rocker?' All of Hollywood is a twitter. No. She couldn't have. She wouldn't have. Then the question is, where is Judy Jetson and where is Sky Rocker? [dramatic music] (Felonia) 'Let's try the truth-beam again.' What is your name? Billy Booster. Well, sometimes it's Sky Rocker but it's really Billy Booster. Enough. Enough! Gruff, are you sure the truth-beam is working? Yes, Your Highness. Where did you get the words to that song? From Judy Jetson. The girl. The girl again! But I wrote the music. [gasps] He said it. He said mu-mu-mu.. slosh slosh Thank you, Gruff. (Comsat on screen) Commander Comsat reporting, Your Highness. Yes? Yes! I decoded the message you sent. It wasn't easy but I found what you were looking for. - I think. - What? What's that? (Comsat) 'This is what we found when we followed the decoded message.' That's not the Megagamma 12. But going on the rockers' "We Rock Around The Galaxy" translates into three paces left-- That's not the message I sent. This is the message I sent. ting "Gleep glorp fleeble flabble zip zot zam?" Gleep glorp fleeble flabble zip zot zam. What a song! What a girl! Quiet, you fool! Oh! Surrounded by fools! Uh, I did find some news on Zooma-Zooma you might be interested in. Something that I hear you're lookin' for. A girl. An Earth girl. [gasps] Yes! The girl. The girl will have the answer! [instrumental music] Look at all the damage they did. At least they didn't get the Megamma 12. But they sure did a job on everythin' else. Yeah, totally trashed. (High Loopy Zoomy) Look at the bright side. We've still got the music. [saxophone music] Ha ha ha. It looks like some of these instruments are still okay. [crying] But look at my dolly. She's ruined. That's okay, Zippy. We'll get you a brand-new doll. Yeah, and a brand-new house. I don't want a brand-new house. It won't be the same. I want my old home. With my pretty pink bed and my blue toy chest. [sobbing] Don't cry, Zippy. A new house can be just like your old home. That's right. A home is a place where people love you. ♪ A house may have windows ♪ ♪ Some walls and a floor ♪ ♪ A kitchen ♪ ♪ A back porch ♪ ♪ A roof, a front door ♪ ♪ But it's still just a house ♪ ♪ Till it has one thing more ♪ ♪ A house full of love is a home ♪ [instrumental music] ♪ A house may have pictures ♪ ♪ A desk and a chair ♪ ♪ Wall-to-wall carpets ♪ ♪ Or floors can be bare ♪ ♪ But it's still just a house ♪ ♪ One thing more must be there ♪ ♪ A house full of love is a home ♪ ♪ Home is a kitchen ♪ ♪ Where cookies are made ♪ ♪ The whole family is there ♪ ♪ On Christmas day ♪ ♪ A place to be glad in ♪ ♪ To sometimes be sad in ♪ ♪ Where neighborhood kids come to play ♪ ♪ The house can be big ♪ ♪ Or it can be small ♪ ♪ A tumble-down shack ♪ ♪ Or three stories tall ♪ ♪ It's still just a house ♪ ♪ One thing more does it all ♪ ♪ A house full of love is a home ♪ ♪ A ho-ouse full of love ♪ ♪ Is a home ♪ I guess my new home is okay, after all. That's wonderful, Zippy. I wonder if we'll ever see our home again. [dramatic music] It's Felonia. Hide! [all screaming] Judy, come on. No. It's me she wants. The zoomies have suffered enough trying to protect me. pew pew Uh, but then again.. pew scream Judy! [dramatic music] [instrumental music] (Rhoda) 'Good evening, rock fans across the universe.' This is Rhoda Starlet with another celestial celebrity report. Ever since Judy Jetson burst on to the scene few hours ago people have been asking, where'd she come from? 'What is she really like?' 'And Judy who?' In rare home movie footage which we, ahem, borrowed from the Jetson household we can see that Judy was fascinated by rock and roll from the very beginning. (George on screen) Ah! (Judy on screen) He he he. Even back then, Judy's music gave her father a headache. Instead of learning to walk like most children Judy's first steps were the toestar twist and the Martian hop. [instrumental music] And Judy's first wordsastounded everyone. Can you say ma? Can you say da? Can you say anything? Wop ba loo bop sha wop bam boom! It was the first sign of whatwould be an auspicious career. [instrumental music] With us now in the studio is Rosie, the Jetsons' maid. Thank you for joing us, Rosie. No problem. I loved being dragged out of bed in the middle of the night. Uh, yes. Well, tell us, Rosie. What is your earliest memory of Judy's song writing? Mm, I remember Miss Judy wrote a song once about a boy in her class. Rosie, I just finished my ode to Larry Lunar. - Wanna hear it? - Do I have a choice? ♪ Larry Lunar Larry Lunar ♪ ♪ You're such a dream I wanna scream ♪ ♪ 'Cause every June beneath the moon ♪ ♪ You make me wanna croon ♪ ♪ You great big goon goon goon goon ♪ ♪ Goon ♪ [Astro whimpering] I knew love was blind, but I didn't know it was tone deaf. What happened? Did somebody scream? [laughing] Very funny. For your information, I was singing. I'm glad you told me, I wouldn't have known. When you're older, Elroy, you'll know what it feels like to fall in love. Gee, I hope not. Sounds painful. Oh, love is a many splendored thing. It makes me wanna break into song. ♪ La la la la la la la la-a ♪ Gee, Judy. You wouldn't have to break in, if you could find the right key. And you knew from that moment on that Judy would grow up to play music? No. I thought Elroy would grow up to play the catskills. And earlier tonight Judy's father had this reaction to his daughter's success. Hey, wait a minute. This is all a big mistake. And so tonight, the universe waits to find out what happened to Judy Jetson? Was success too much for her? Or is she in some kind of terrible danger? [dramatic music] [music continues] Oh, the famous Judy Jetson. We meet at last. Where's Sky Rocker? What have you done with him? All in good time, my dear. Gruff, feed these instruments into the basher. Yes, Your Highness. [dramatic music] Come, my dear. This should prove very interesting to you. [music continues] [whirring] (Judy) 'What are you doing to those instruments?' Destroying them. [whirring] Oh, that sounds horrible. You can destroy a few instruments but you'll never destroy music. She said it. She said m-m.. splash Oh, I hate that word. You're wrong. Soon I, Felonia Funk, will destroy all M U S I C! - You're mad. - Thank you. Ah, that must be Commander Comsat. Put the girl in the interrogation room. 'I'll deal with her later.' pew [instrumental music] Oh! Sky Rocker, are you alright? My name isn't Sky Rocker, it's Billy Booster. (Judy) 'Oh, what's she done to you?' I am under the truth beam. I cannot tell a lie. Baby, baby. How do I turn this thing off? 'Oh, simple.' [instrumental music] Huh? Judy! What are you doing here? It's a long story. I'm just glad you're alright. "And heidi hodi heebie jeebie means three cubits to the right and four cubits to the left." Good work, Comsat. You've broken the code. And the Megamma 12 must be right in here. We will retrieve it for you right away, Your Highness. Never mind. This time I'll get it myself. What about the singer and the girl? Don't worry, Gruff. I've got plans for them. [laughing] So you're really Judy Jetson's dad? Yeah, but-- Gee, sometimes the neatest kids have the weirdest parents. No, ha ha ha, you see this is all a mistake. Nicky Neuron and Ramm Rocket, your parents are here to bail you out. Hey, what about me? Why would their parents wanna bail you out? Very funny. Jetson! Jetson, are you in here? Mr. Spacely, am I glad to see you. I knew somebody would come to bail me out. I didn't come here to bail you out, Jetson. I came here to tell you you're fired! Fired? But I can explain. No explanation can get you out of this one, Jetson. I can't have the whole galaxy seen an employee of mine in jail. And dressed like, uh, uh, like some kinda.. Say, what are you dressed like, Jetson? Oh, this? Ha ha ha. Well, I-I was, uh...I mean, uh.. Never mind. I'm sure I don't wanna know. No, wait. Please, Mr. Spacely. You're fired and that's final! Oh, great. First I'm arrested and now I'm fired, all in one night. Psst, dad. Elroy, what're you doing here? I'm busting you out. My space scout combination pocketknife and can opener ought to do the trick. whirr But isn't this illegal? Gosh, no, dad. All the space scouts have 'em. creak thud Anyway, we gotta rescue Judy. Come on. Great, first I'm a punk. Then I'm an escape con. Reorge. Ah! Will you knock it off, butterfingers? Roy, you look range. Okay, so I look strange. Even my own dog's a critic. whoosh I still find it hard to believe. All this stuff about Judy being kidnapped by a flying saucer. What am I saying? After tonight I'll believe anything. So, anyway, I traced the flying saucer on my computer and it's from Zooma-Zooma. Zooma-Zooma? Why, that's two billion miles from here. It'll take us at least a day and a half on this. Don't worry, dad. I got a plan. Some plan, Elroy. I feel like I'm in a race car at the inter plane topless 500. - Yeah, it's fun. - Thanks for the ride, guys. No problem. Come on, Ramm, shift this thing into hyperspace. We've got to save Judy. Okay. Here it goes. You mean this thing goes faster? That ought to hold you until I get the Megamma 12. I take it y-you're not a member of my fan club? I'm glad you have a sense of humor, Sky Rocker. You'll need it. Ha ha ha. [laughing] whoosh So, I guess we just, uh, hang around till she gets back. creak Yow! The rope's breaking! [intense music] I sure hope she gets back soon. [instrumental music] (Quasar) Uh, pardon me, bud. Could you tell us how to get to the Photon Nebula? Sorry, fellows, I don't live around here. - Here give me that map. - Okay, okay. Now, the way I figure it, we're here 'and this is the Earth there.' Ooh, my gum! I wondered where I put that. - You, lame brain. - 'Hey, muck.' Fill her up with a super unloader and check under the hood, will ya? Sure. [instrumental music] That'll be eight million dollars. Eight million dollars? I won't pay. [music continues] Sheesh! I remember when a tank of gas was only four million dollars. Excuse us, sir, but could you tell us how to get to the Photon Nebula? Gee, I think it's...that way. Gee, thanks a lot. What do we do now? Well, first we got to get us a car. Look, here comes a nice one now. screech We'd better fill up if we're gonna make it to Zooma-Zooma. Gee, Ramm, what kinda mileage does this baby get? She's a real gas guzzler. She only gets 3,000 light-years to the gallon. But she's fast. Wow! This is the kinda car I want when I grow up. - Okay, dad? - Sure, why not. I'll promise anything. This is probably all just a nightmare anyway. Rook. (Astro) Food, rummy. slurp - I'm hungry. - I don't know, Astro. We're in a hurry. Judy's in trouble. tink tink tink tink tink tink Look, there's nobody in it. They must have gone into the diner. Hey, that's not a bad idea. I'm a little peckish myself. Come on, you. Great, they left the keys. Hey, haven't we seen this car before. Never mind that, just get in. This time I'll drive. vroom vroom vroom thud thud thud Get your hands off that! [indistinct chattering] I hope Judy's alright. Me too. She's my new best friend. She's gotten out of worse jams than this before. - 'Take cover!' - Uh-oh! What now? It's one of Felonia's ships. [all screaming] vroom That's strange. She went right past us. She doesn't want us. She wants the Megamma 12. I'm afraid Felonia's broken the code. [dramatic music] Out of my way, you little green beach bums. zap [both screaming] [music continues] (automated message) 'Three cubits, then turn left.' Fine. It won't be long now. Spears? Oh, great. zap [screaming] At last. The Megagamma 12. whoosh Yes! Yes! Oh, glorious day! Oh! Now, back to activate the mental flosser. [laughing] Now, this really is a bummer. I wish Judy was here. She always has a plan. I wish I had a plan. Yeah. This is not my idea of a swinging scene. creak Swinging. That's it. - It is? - Sure, Sky. You're a rock star, let's rock. creak creak creak I don't know what you're talking about, Judy but I dig your enthusiasm. Faster. Faster! Faster! creak snap [both screaming] 'Whoa!' boing [dramatic music] Sky Rocker, we did it. Yeah, but there's something I've been meaning to tell you. My name's not Sky, it's, uh.. Billy Booster. He he. I think it's a wonderful name. You do? I-I mean, h-how did you know? You told me when you were under the truth beam. The truth beam. Wow! Oh, that seems a solid blank. Did I tell you, I think you're the spaciest chick I ever met. I am? Oh, Sky. Aha! So you've escaped, huh? Uh-oh. It's Mr. Ugly. [Gruff laughing] [intense music] Go ahead and laugh, you, you inter-galactic galoot. But you'll never destroy music. I don't want to destroy music. I want to help you. I don't care if you do wanna help us.. What did you say? I'm on the zoomies side. That's how the zoomies knew about Felonia's plan. Wow, you're on our side! Yeah, but we got to hurry. We don't have much time. (Quark) 'Goodie! Home safe at last.' vroom crash That's the last time I let you drive. Me? You were driving. Never mind. The important thing is we made it back here. [instrumental music] Come on, we gotta report to the boss. The coast is clear. Uff, sure is cramped in there. Uh, you're telling me. Look at what these guys did to my car. (Nicky) 'You're lucky it's just the car.' If Elroy hadn't recognized those two guys back at the service station, who know what they would have done to us? Yeah, specially after the way they chased Judy. I wonder where we are? Probably some place we don't wanna be. Now, let's get out of here. No way, this must be the villains' secret lair. [instrumental music] Look at all the keen bikes. D-don't touch anything, Elroy. These guys might blast us. I wonder how this works? Elroy, no! Whoa! Help! Elroy, stop this crazy thing! Uh, I can't. Reorge! Whoa! pew pew pew pew pew Hey, wait for us. I only hope it's not too late. Felonia's already on her way to the mental flosser. We can't let her get away with this. You said it, baby. We gotta cool off that mean machine. (Quark and Quasar) Hup me, two, three, four. Hup me, two, three, four. - Oh! - Watch where you're going. Oh, yeah? Watch where you're not going. Quark and Quasar reporting for duty, sir. Quark, Quasar. Uh, what are you doing here? We work here. Ha ha ha. Quiet, you. I just caught these prisoners trying to escape. We'll take care of those two. Come on, you! (Gruff) 'Uh, that won't be necessary.' 'I'm taking them to the mental flosser.' - 'Cool, we'll help you.' - You can't. I mean, I can handle them. Well, it's okay. We'll go along for the ride. Yeah, I could use a good mental flossing. I'll say. You got plaque on the brain. (George) 'Yike! Gangway!' Yippee yai yay yai yay! Hey, it's a rodeo. Yeah, we're gonna get branded. [both screaming] pew pew It's after us. Ow! Help! - Ah! - Yahoo! [both screaming] Huh, some ride, eh, dad? Conductor, let me off at the next stop. Dad! Elroy! - Judy. - Judy, am I too late? Wow, that's your dad? What a spacey guy. Hi, Mr. Jetson, I'm Sky Rocker. - Pleased to-- - Sky Rocker. Don't you "Mr. Jetson" me, you cosmic Casanova. Trying to run off with my daughter, eh? But, daddy, I can explain. - 'Reorge!' - 'Astro.' (both) Judy. Ramm, Nicky. This is no time for family reunions. You've gotta get outta here before Quark and Quasar get back. He's right. We've got to get the zoomies to help us or Felonia will destroy all the music in the universe. Come on. This sounds serious. This sounds dangerous. This sounds like an adventure. Will somebody please tell me what's going on? [instrumental music] pew [both screaming] It's closing in on us. pew pew pew Quick, this way. pew pew You ninny, this is all your fault. My fault? If we ever get outta this, the first thing I'll do is request for a new partner. pew pew [both screaming] pew pew [instrumental music] Oh, daddy. Don't you think I know what I'm doing? - I'd never let you down. - But, Judy honey. I thought I was losing my little girl to some rock star. Now that I know it's only the fate of the universe at stake I'm relieved. And I hope you're not upset with me. Of course not. You're the best father in the whole galaxy. Ahem, I hate to interrupt warm family moments but we only have about five minutes to prevent the destruction of civilization as we know it. Oh, sorry. Don't worry about me, you kids run along and have fun. These kids today. Ha ha ha. Preventing the destruction of civilization. Ha ha. What'll they think of next? Huh? The destruction of civilization? Hey, wait for me. [instrumental music] So, that's the problem, gang. We've got to stop Felonia. But we zoomies are peaceful creatures. [saxophone music] Yeah, we don't have any weapons. Hmm. Oh, yes, we do. We have the best weapon for fighting Felonia. Music. (both) Music? Ramm, rev up your roadster. The rest of you come with me. We've gotta save rock and roll.

But I don't need this anymore. I'm through being a phony. - I wanna be me. - 'What do you mean?' From now on I'm not Sky Rocker, I'm me, Billy Booster. Oh, Billy. [instrumental music] (Felonia) 'I can't believe it.' I can't believe I was done in by a mere Earth girl. [Felonia crying] (male #3) 'Okay, move along, lady.' To think that I, Felonia Funk, would be undone by music. Oops! I said.. I said m-m.. ...mu-mu-mu.. clang swoosh Well, I hope that's the last we'll see of Felonia Funk. The galaxy is safe for rock and roll. Long live rock and roll. [all cheering] (Rhoda) 'We are here at the Jetsons' apartment building' awaiting the victorious arrival of Judy Jetson and Sky Rocker. [all cheering] (Rhoda) 'Here they come now.' 'Here's Judy Jetson, but who is she with?' Could this be Sky Rocker? Rhoda, I'm giving you an exclusive. You're gonna be hearing lots from this guy. He's the latest. He's Billy Booster. But whatever happened to Sky Rocker? Well, you might say he's a new man. [all cheering] And we're a new team.

[babbling] Great promotional idea you had, Jetson. Sponsoring this benefit concert. Yeah, that's right, Mr. Spacely. Ha ha. I, uh, planned it all along. Who are you talking to, dear? Uh, Mr. Spacely. Mr. Spacely, where'd he go? Remember, kids, buy Spacely sprockets. The sprockets that rock and roll. Remind me to make you a vice president, Jetson. See, dear, everything worked out fine. Yeah, but there's one thing I don't understand. If Billy Booster used to be Sky Rocker how can he be playing on Zooma-Zooma when Sky Rocker's supposed to be giving a concert on Earth? It's just like Billy said, dad Sky Rocker's a new man. (man on screen) Baby, baby, baby.
