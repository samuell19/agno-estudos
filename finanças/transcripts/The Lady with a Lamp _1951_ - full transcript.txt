I feel the bestowal of this honour is rather belated, don't you, Sir? Perhaps it is. A distinguished member of Parliament told me yesterday he thought she was dead. We forget our national heroes while they're still alive very quickly. When she does die, I suppose she will leave behind her the greatest record of individual achievement of any English woman. Yes, she will indeed. Achievement wrought of real sacrifice, for she was no recluse you know, Nugent. She loved life passionately and fully. At Broadlands, the home of her friends the Palmerston's, she often danced the night through. Thank you Mr. Herbert. That was delightful. May I return the compliment Miss Florence? I uh, presume you're engaged for the next dance? Yes, I have promised it to Richard Monckton Milnes. Oh, as usual I see your card is promised for the whole evening. Yes, I'm afraid it is Mr. Herbert. I am sorry. Flo my dear, my Waltz I believe. Yes Richard. I'm afraid you'll make yourself ill my dear. Oh Sidney dear, Parthenope's very distressed about her sister. Oh? What's the matter with Miss Florence? She does not seem to be happy or able to enjoy her life. Well, she's doing quite well at the moment. She's just danced me to a standstill. She's doing the same to Richard and her card is promised for the entire evening. But there's another side to her Mr. Herbert. It's so bewildering. It makes me so nervous and Mama. The best remedy for nervous young ladies Miss Parthenope is a cool drink of claret cup. Thank you dearest and I should enjoy one too. Now Parthe, you must not worry about Florence. Pleasant evening Palmerston. Thank you Herbert. I've just been asking Liz to try and persuade you to stay on a few days. Oh, I shall need little persuasion. There's nothing we enjoy more than our visits to Broadlands. I rather hope the Prime Minister may be joining us. I think this situation in Russia wants a little quiet reflection, don't you? The situation in Russia my dear Palmerston needs a great deal of quiet reflection. I danced this Waltz a great deal when I was in Rome. I would've given my eyes to have been with you. Oh! How absurd you are Richard. When one is in Rome, eyes are essential. Flo my dear, I want to talk to you. It's important and very urgent. Will you come out on the terrace? Can we not talk here Richard? Please Flo. Very well. At last Lady Palmerston. At last what Mrs. Nightingale? At last Mr. Milnes has got Florence alone. Will you excuse me my dear? Lady Palmerston. My husband would be content is Florence never married. Oh, I do hope something comes of it. At all events, Richard will make a very patient husband. Flo my dear, I cannot wait another day for your decision. I wrote you from Egypt, Richard. Did you not get my letter? Yes, indeed I did. You told me of the places you had visited. You told me that you had again been dreaming, dreaming of what you believe God has called you to do in this world. That is true. You told me of your visit to Kaiserswerth in Germany, and of how much your experience as a nurse there had meant to you. You told me of the bitter opposition of your family to your own plan. You see? I remember every word. But you did not answer my question. It is over four years since he first proposed. Florence is a great problem to us. I could name 20 men who are dying to marry her, but she seems to have no more than a friendly interest in any of them. It must be very disappointing for you. It is more than disappointing. We have given her an excellent education, we have allowed her to travel extensively and at the end of it all what does she want to do? Become a nurse in a hospital at Salisbury. Do you not want love dear Flo? A home, children? My heart cries out for them. Then why not? Is not my love for you stronger than any cause? Marry me, Flo. Or have you no feeling for me? Richard, I love you. I love you dearly but I cannot marry you and I have told you why. Please, do not ask me again. Is that irrevocable? Yes, irrevocable. May you not regret the step you're taking, and may you find happiness which apparently I cannot give you. Richard. Dear Richard, please let us return. Miss Florence? Who is it? It's me Miss Florence, George Winch. Oh, it is all right Richard. He is one of our under gardeners. I'm sorry Sir, to speak to Miss Florence like this but I... What is it George? It's me mother Miss Florence. She's hurt. I didn't know what to do, I... - Find Austin. Tell him to bring the carriage and I will come with you at once. Yes, Miss Florence. But surely you and your mama do not object to Miss Florence nursing the sick in the village? Oh, but they have proper persons for that kind of work Mr. Herbert. And who are they? Well, not one of our class like Flo. Oh yes. I hope I'm not being profane Mr. Herbert, but Flo once told us that she'd had a call from God. You can imagine how worrying that was to Mama and Papa. Very worrying but probably the truth. Mr. Herbert, I do believe you approve of Flo. I do indeed. I think I know exactly how she feels. There she goes. And I suppose we shall not see her again until dinner time. She's the most unnatural girl. Where does she get these ideas from William? She has a comfortable home. Why cannot she be happy in it? But no, everything must be changed, altered, reformed. We are like two ducks who are brought into the world of wild swan. William, you must speak to her. How can I speak to ger my dear? She's no longer a child. Well, she has a duty to her parents, child or no child. She's becoming so outspoken Papa. Some of the things she says are on the fringe of immodesty. No doubt she picks them up from associating with those common nurses. But on that point I am adamant. On which point? Nursing of course. Oh, I don't mind her giving the little normal comforts as Parthe and I do, like, well, like port wine to Mrs. Cribbage or gruel to her husband, but the other day a farmhand fell off a hayrick and broke his thigh. Oh yes, this is scandalous Papa. Florence wanted to make a splint for the man but I absolutely refused to allow her. Flo I said, you may bandage a man below the knee or above the shoulder but nowhere else. Now, you are to stay in bed and rest, and I shall ask Dr. Trotter to come and see you. I'm grateful to you Miss Florence. Real grateful. Well, show it by getting well Mrs. Winch and quickly. And do not spill boiling water over yourself again. This window will not open. Oh, that's nailed up. I reckon that hasn't been open for 10 years. George, have you anything I can take these nails out with? Yes, there's hammer here Miss Florence. Oh no. Let me have it please. Oh, I shall die of cold, I know I will. You will die of something far worse Mrs. Winch if you go on sleeping in this atmosphere. God's good fresh air is what you need and plenty of it. There now. That is better. Leave it like that day and night. But the night air Miss Florence. That is all old fashioned nonsense about night air not being good for one. Now good day Mrs. Winch. Good day Miss Florence. Is there anything I can do to help Mother, Miss Florence? Yes George, there is. I would like to speak to you. George, your mother tells me you want to be head gardener at Embley Park. Oh, one day Miss Florence. That I do, surely. Now, what would happen to all the plants if they were deprived of fresh air and choked with weeds? Well, I reckon they'd die Miss Florence. And that is exactly what may happen to your mother if this cottage is not cleaned out. Now get some hot water and disinfectant and start scrubbing at once. Floors, furniture, every bit of it and see that the windows are kept open. Yes, Miss Florence. Here is half a sovereign. Go and buy your mother some calf's foot jelly and a bottle of port wine and when I come tomorrow, I want to find the cottage spotless. It will be spotless. Spotless. But why should we have to fight the Russians just because the Czar does not like the Turks? Or the Turks do not like the Czar? Yes, it goes a little deeper then that Mrs. Nightingale, but Herbert's the man to give you an opinion. For my part I, I hate the very thought of war. I'm not saying that Turkey should accede to Russia's demands but everything must be done by our government in the role of peacemaker. Don't you agree Palmerston? That my dear Herbert is a question you must put to the Prime Minister. I'm only Home Secretary. But we both share responsibilities as members of the Cabinet and war is not a gamble that I personally am anxious to take. But the people are for war. They want it. I do trust that nothing has happened to Florence. I trust not. One of my tenants had accident Lady Palmerston so I understand. Yes dear, but that is no reason why Florence should be late for dinner. Please sit down. I, I was quite unaware of the time. I do apologise Mama. I apologise Papa. How is Mrs. Winch, Flo? I had to call in Dr. Trotter. She was in considerable pain this... You were saying Lord Palmerston? I um, I'm not sure now what I was saying. No thank you. Now Florence, are you not eating? No, I'm not hungry Mama. I will wait for dessert. You wear yourself out with this ridiculous nursing and then refuse to keep up your strength. Appetite for work so often destroys appetite for food, don't you find Miss Florence? Thank you Mr. Herbert. I uh, I hear your cousin was cut out of the colonel's will Bracebridge? Yes, most unfortunate. Cut out without a shilling. My niece has had to go out to work as a governess. It is the only profession for a lady is it not Mr. Bracebridge? If she's without means. Why should it be the only profession, Mama? Why should not a woman, if she has the brains become a doctor or even a lawyer? Oh, don't be ridiculous Florence. How would any woman possibly become a lawyer? Portia made rather a good one Mrs. Nightingale. Oh, that was Shakespeare, Mr. Herbert, but in real life women have their place in the home and there as I tell Florence continually, is where they should remain. The status of women is changing. We have women writers now. The Bronte's, Jane Austen, whose work has reached a very high standard. I see the day when women will enter not only the professions, but politics as well. Why stop at politics? Perhaps Miss Florence would like to see the ladies joining the Army? That is an absurd remark Lord Palmerston. Florence! Apologise to Lord Palmerston immediately. Not at all, not at all Mrs. Nightingale. Your daughter has great spirit and I enjoy an argument, but you did tell me the other day that we ought to employ ladies in military hospitals which is almost the same thing. I made that suggestion Lord Palmerston because at the present time the state of our military hospitals is a disgrace. A sick soldier is treated as a malingerer, little or no attempt is made to find out why he is ill, nor to get him well again. Mr. Herbert has listened to my point of view most sympathetically but what chance has he of making reforms when the rest of the Cabinet cannot see their noses in front of their faces? Hm, I wonder if it's going to rain tomorrow. It, it seemed quite cloudy before dinner Papa. The suggestion you made to me Miss Florence was that the male orderlies should be replaced by female nurses. Now that seems to me to be a most dangerous policy. Why Lord Palmerston? Because the common soldier is quite debauched enough as it is. Quite frankly, to employ female nurses in hospitals would merely be providing him with fresh temptation. But Lord Palmerston, these women must be selected with the greatest possible care, and months spent in training them in the fundamental duties of nursing. I agree with you. To employ the kind of women who today call themselves nurses would be disastrous. Not only have they no knowledge whatsoever of how to care for the sick, but nine out of 10 of them are drunkards and most of them are prostitutes. Florence! Shall we, shall we ladies retire to the drawing room? Will men never understand that some women want to use their own brains and direct their own lives? Athena, you are a wise owl. Tell me what I am to do. Perhaps my work does not matter. Perhaps I flatter myself and I'm being punished for false pride. And yet, yet I cannot go on living here in luxury while all around me I see so much suffering. Dear God, help me please. Please, help me. How much longer must I struggle? Who is that? Me Flo, dear. Please, may I come in? Of course. Oh, how can you? How can you make us so unhappy? Do you think I want to? Poor Mama, she's gone to bed in tears. I know I make you all unhappy and it is like knives in my heart because I do. But why? Why must you? How can I explain? When, when we were children, we loved each other so much. I love you now but our lives have taken different paths. Oh, darling Parthe, I would give anything in the world to save you pain, but I do not interfere with your life. Why should you wish me to change mine? It has become such a strange life, Flo. To you yes, because you do not understand what is in my heart and mind. You were ashamed of me when I went to Kaiserswerth to train to be a nurse, and when I worked with the Sisters of Charity in Paris. You were ashamed of me this evening at dinner because I spoke my mind. If I am destroying your peace and happiness, I can only plead your forgiveness. I cannot alter my nature. But why must you be so different? Why must you go on blowing a trumpet for humanity? But Parthenope, struggle has always made some noise. We have been brought up in surroundings where struggle is unknown. I hate to wound all your beloved hearts but, but if I am out of harmony with the things that interest you is that my fault? Are you dreaming again? Not dreaming, cursing. You've caught me in a bad mood I'm afraid, Mr. Herbert. What brings you to Broadlands, Miss Florence? I have come to apologise to Lady Palmerston. About the little scene at dinner last night? Yes. Oh, I was hoping that might've cleared the atmosphere. On the contrary and there was a dreadful quarrel at breakfast this morning because I said I still want to go to Salisbury Hospital to nurse. Mama alternated between fits of weeping and calling for sal volatile. Your poor mama makes herself suffer a great deal. Well, Parthenope has retired to her room in hysterics, and poor Papa sought sanctuary in the library. Oh, wise Papa. So to relieve their distress, I have decided to give up the idea entirely. Of Salisbury or of nursing? Salisbury. I'm glad of that. Why are you glad Mr. Herbert? Because I have something in mind which I think may be of interest to you but not in Salisbury. This would involve your leaving home. Liz as you know is on the Committee of the Hospital for sick gentlemen. They are seeking a superintendent to take charge. May I recommend you? This is the answer to all my prayers, to all my dreams. I would say myself that it may be the beginning. This is a hospital for gentlemen Miss Nightingale, and I hope I am as broad minded as any of us here, but I do draw the line at admitting Roman Catholics. I want all you ladies of the Committee to understand that this bigotry is meaningless to me. Unless we open our doors to all denominations, to Roman Catholics, to Jews and if necessary to Mohammedans, I must ask you to accept my resignation. Oh, but my dear Miss Nightingale... But you cannot resign Miss Nightingale. As the Lady Superintendent you've done so much. You've reduced the daily expenditure from one and 10 pence to a shilling a head and the cost of jam making from seven pence to four pence a pound. Ladies, I insist upon a ruling. I think it would be better to allow Miss Nightingale to run this hospital as she feels it should be run, and I'm sure Miss Nightingale is very busy so shall we? Yes, I think we'd better. Miss Nightingale. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Good afternoon ladies. Everything possible has been done to avoid war, but we are all agreed that we must have a friendly power at the Bosphorous, holding the keys of the Mediterranean from the West. We are not bound by treaty to enter this quarrel, but in the interest of Europe, we cannot allow Turkey to be overborne by Russia. Hear, hear! A fine body of men Mr. Herbert. They do you credit. I hope the government does credit to them. Hey, we're packed up to the gunnels now. How many men have you got there? 62 Sergeant. All right, get 'em onboard. Where are we going Serg? Barrack Hospital, Scutari. God help us. Hear that Mr. Russel? God help us. God help us is the cry of the men, when they know they are going to the Scutari Barrack Hospital. The "Times" says the wounded are being treated like savages. It's a disgrace to the nation. Why ain't we got no Sisters of Charity like the French? It's murder, that's what it is and is the government's responsible? The whole ruddy lot of them. What the devil do these journalists want to interfere for Gladstone? They're not running the war, we are. Apparently they do not think we are running it very well Lord Palmerston. Change the government! Why won't somebody help us? That's him. Sidney Herbert, Minster for War. The Duke of Newcastle is Minister for War. Sidney Herbert is Minister at War. And what's the difference? I haven't the slightest idea. Have you seen your "Times" this morning Herbert? Yes, I have indeed. It would appear the entire populous has seen it. This fellow Howard Russel is confounded nuisance. "The manner in which the sick and wounded "are treated is worthy only of the savages of Dahomey. "Surgeons are not to be had "and the male nurses and orderlies are useless." Sending a newspaper reporter to the seat of war. What are we coming to? I happen to know Howard Russel. I don't believe he'd written those articles nor would the "Times" have published them if the facts were not true. Are you trying to say that he knows better than our own own own ambassador and the Inspector General? Why, only last week Stratford reported that the hospital situation is perfectly satisfactory. Why they've just taken over the Turkish barracks at Scutari. Russel's on the spot Palmerston and we're not. We must take action ourselves at once. The action has already been takin' my dear Herbert. Lady Forester is organising a band of nurses privately of course, and at her own expense to go out to Constantinople forthwith. I'm afraid I must entirely disagree with that proposal Gladstone. Why? It cannot succeed. It won't cost the government a penny. There is no question of pounds and shillings and pences as matters. Have you any suggestion to offer Herbert? Yes, I have. In my opinion, such an expedition needs someone with nursing experience and one who is fully supported by the government. Mrs. Nightingale, Sir. Mr. Herbert, I have interviewed 128 women out of which I have managed to find only 14 who are reasonably suitable. I shall now approach the religious institutions. Oh, you will find them. I have no doubt about that. Come and sit down while I tell you some of the arrangements. When do we leave? In four days. I've asked Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge to accompany you if you agree. I do indeed. Salina will be of great assistance to me. And Charles can take care of the financial side of the expedition. You will go on by train Boulogne to Marseilles where you'll spend two or three days before going onboard the Vectis. Excellent. It will give me an opportunity for purchasing equipment and medical supplies. You have little faith I notice in the government. I have infinite faith in one member of it. Thank you. I will do my utmost to support you from London. But sending women to the seat of war is something quite new and voices out there may be raised against it. Yes, I'm afraid so. Yeah. Listen, myself I have no doubt whatsoever as to your ultimate success. Thank you. My success does not matter but, if your plan succeeds Mr. Herbert, we shall have broken down such a wall of prejudice that will multiply the good for all time. Yes, I quite agree. I've written to Lord Stratford our Ambassador and Dr. Menzies with the chief medical office of the Barrack Hospital. Now, is there anything else you wish to discuss? No, I do not think so. As there so little time perhaps you will excuse me. You will please write to me from Scutari? Oh, I shall write officially and I shall write privately. I shall keep nothing from you, good or bad. In our dealings with people Miss Florence, you have the great advantage of being unemotional. Oh, make no mistake Mr. Herbert. I have all the emotions of a woman, but if I have learned anything so far it is how to control them. Well, now I say goodbye. Goodbye. God bless you Florence. Godspeed your journey. Goodbye Sidney. I, I shall rely on you always. They're here Sidney. Salina. Charles, it is such a comfort to know that you will be with me. Flo, dear we're delighted aren't we Charles? We are indeed. I know Turkey well. You know I think you'll need someone like me to take care of 38 ladies eh, Sidney? Yes Charles, you'll make an excellent chaperone. Come along ladies. Black nuns to the fore, white nuns to the rear, and nurses to the centre. Charles, is this absolutely necessary? Yes it is my dear. I learned the value of discipline when I was in the Militia and now I'm going to put it into practise. I'm not at all happy with the reports I've received from Constantinople. Lord Stratford seemed rosy enough. He was busy being diplomatic. And Raglan's? Too busy at fighting. Miss Nightingale ought to be there by now. Just about, yes. You worried? Not on her account no, but the public are gonna expect miracles. We'll have to give all the help and support we can Palmerston. Yes, I wonder how she'll be received. I wonder, yes. I hear Miss Nightingale is a high-faluting society creature. Oh, a politician. Mr. Sidney Herbert is responsible for this novel idea. This government has done some deuced silly things but sending 40 women to this hospital is quite the silliest. Give them a chance Sir, give them a chance. If they can make this place any less of a hell than it is it might be better for all of us. The men are... I'm sorry, Sir. That young man's losing his nerve. I shall have to be sending him home. It might suit us better Sir if you sent Miss Nightingale home. Yes? Lady by the name of Nightingale to see your Honour. Oh. Show her in. Am I smart enough gentlemen to meet a lady? Dr. Menzies? At your service Madame. I am Miss Nightingale. Oh, thank you gentlemen. Welcome to the Barrack Hospital, Miss Nightingale. I feel sure that your presence here and that of your ladies will bring great comfort to our men. I trust so Dr. Menzies. No doubt you would like to retire to your quarters and rest after your journey. Thank you. My uh, party has already gone to their quarters but if it is not inconvenient to you I would like to see around the hospital. Oh? I fear you will see many distressing sights Miss Nightingale. I am a nurse Dr. Menzies. This is not exactly a hospital, but the Turkish barracks utilised for our purpose. Yes, I was aware of that. Then I take it you are aware that we have male orderlies to look after the sick and wounded and that they attend to such things that no lady of course could do. I would like to assure you Doctor Menzies that among my group of women there are no ladies in your sense of the word. We are all nurses and ready to help in any way you may decide. News has just come through of another great battle, so there'll be plenty of work for willing hands to do. But I want you all to remember one very important thing, and that is discipline. You're under the direct orders of Miss Nightingale, and every instruction you receive must be obeyed instantly. Now, is that quite clear? Yes Mr. Bracebridge. All right. Now then, any questions? Yes, Mr. Bracebridge. As Constantinople's only just over the other side of the water, I suppose you should be able to go there and see the sights, when we're off duty. I have no doubt Nurse Johnson. When you are off duty you will find this part of the world very interesting. There's plenty here to see. Now, any other questions? Yes Sir. I've seen bugs in this bed, Sir. That is not a question Nurse Turner, that is a statement. Well, I warned you Miss Nightingale you would see some very distressing sights. You did indeed and I trust our presence here may alleviate some of the suffering of these poor men. I feel sure your ladies can do quite useful work in attending to the last wishes of the dying. I am more interested in attending to the living Dr. Menzies. Only God can help the dying. Quite, quite. Now, I am naturally under your orders, so when you want us my nurses are at your service. When I need them I will send for them Miss Nightingale. Well, we are here. You will be I know, anxious to get to work but you must all clearly understand that until I receive orders from Dr. Menzies we must occupy ourselves with work other then nursing the sick and wounded. For the first few days I think it more likely we shall be scrubbing floors then tending the sick. But Mr. Bracebridge says that 400 more wounded are arriving any minute. Our services are needed in the wards Miss Nightingale. Surely that is our first duty? Your first duty Sister Wheeler is to obey orders. Miss Nightingale? Yes? I'm Dr. Anson. I must apologise but I have 40 men down with cholera and I can't deal with them unless I have your help. Can you let me have some nurses immediately? If you'll get Dr. Menzies permission, yes. He won't give it. Dr. Anson, what do the other doctors feel about us? Most of them want your help too and they... Well, then why do they not ask for it? If they all demand our assistance then something will be done. It is impossible to make demands to a superior officer here. It is impossible for us to help unless Dr. Menzies sends for us. I am sorry Dr. Anson. Gangrene, you'll have to lose it. Bite on this belt my man. Bite hard. Hold him tight. Help! Help! Help! Dr. Menzies, I would not force myself upon you like this were it not for the fact that I have seen with my own eyes men bleeding to death for want of the most elementary attention which my nurses could give them. Oh, Miss Nightingale. But, but it is over three days since I and my party have arrived and it was the whole essence of Mr. Herbert's plan that we should nurse the sick and wounded and not just act as kitchen maids. But your ladies are doing quite useful work Miss Nightingale. They are not doing the work they came out to do. We are, we are trying to clean up some of the indescribable filth of this hospital but beyond that we are doing nothing. As I have already told you Ma'am, we have orderlies to tend to the wants of the men. I, I assure you Madame, the soldiers would be embarrassed if your ladies undertook such personal duties which are necessary in the case of serious illness. My ladies as I persist in calling them Dr. Menzies are all experienced nurses and they will undertake any duty no matter how unpleasant. But I see no necessity to call in female nurses to perform the duties of Army orderlies are carrying out under Army regulations Ma'am. Army regulations. Red tapism. The orderlies are totally unfit to do the things... - If you'll please forgive me Ma'am I have all this correspondence to attend to as you see. Estimates, reports, indents, a whole pile of stuff from the War Office, look at it. While you are reading it Dr. Menzies, men are dying in their hundreds. This is not a hospital for gentlemen Miss Nightingale. This is war. Well, what are Miss Nightingale and her nurses doing? This plan of yours doesn't seem very successful Mr. Herbert. Out of 2,349 men admitted to the Barrack Hospital during a period of three weeks, 1,405 have died. Good heavens, that's nearly 60%. There'll be questions in the House tomorrow which I shall have to answer. What have you to say Mr. Herbert? I would say that the policy of the Treasury over the past three years has been so niggardly with regard to the requirements of my medical staff, we are in everyway totally unequipped to take care of our wounded. I resent that remark Mr. Herbert. You may Mr. Gladstone but the fact remains I've been handicapped at every turn through want of money. With the result, we're short of surgeons, short of equipment and our men out there are dying in thousands. But Miss Nightingale has a private fund of her own. Which up to now she's been unable to use owing to officialdom. My dear Mr. Herbert, we have our prevails. Who spend of their time multiplying correspondence between the different departments. This is no time for sticking at forms. Men's lives are at stake. Much mischief has been done to the countries by the stickling for dignities and precedence between departments. But if the Prime Minister and is it appears the Army do not want Miss Nightingale, so would it not be wiser to bring her home? I agree Lord Palmerston. What have you to say to that Mr. Herbert? If we withdraw our support now, and if we do not give Miss Nightingale the fullest opportunity to justify both herself and our decision to send her, then we shall as the government of this day and hour merit the utter hatred of every wife and mother with a man serving in the Crimea. ♪ And all and all ♪ ♪ We are 100 Pipers ♪ ♪ We'll up and we'll give them a blow, a blow ♪ ♪ We are 100 Pipers and all ♪ Water? Hey? Water. Ah, away. ♪ We are hundred Pipers and all and all ♪ Water? ♪ We are 100 Pipers and all and all ♪ ♪ We are 100 ♪ Here, what's the matter with you? Two gallons of negus and 14 pounds of rice. 96 pounds of arrowroot, two gallons of negus, 14 pounds of rice. I can't stand it Ma'am. I can't stand it any longer. What is it you cannot stand Sister Wheeler? He won't even let us give a man water, and he's dying I tell you, he's dying. Stop making that noise. Now sit down. You don't care do you? You don't care that these men are suffering torment. I can't go on. Sister Wheeler you must learn to control yourself. Now listen very carefully. I understand just how you are feeling my dear, and I am suffering as much as you are, but until I receive permission from Dr. Menzies I can do nothing. It would endanger our whole plan if I did. Will you try to understand that? Yes. I'm sorry. Now, I think you should go back and get on with your scrubbing. She's a good nurse that girl. One of the best we have but too emotional. It's hard for them to learn, especially the young ones. If only they knew how I really feel. Now, will you try and rest? You haven't slept for nights now. Yes, Salina. I will try to get some sleep. And there services of Miss Nightingale and her nurses are being fully utilised? Yes Mr. Russel. You can say that Miss Nightingale and her ladies are rendering useful service. But are they actually nursing the men? Sir, over 300 new cases of asiatic cholera and fever have just arrived. We simply must have some nurses. Well uh, Dr. Anson go to Miss Nightingale. Let her know your requirements. Yes, Sir. But we must have beds and we understand there are no other suppliers in Constantinople. I'm very, very sorry Madame but only with the Purveyor am I allowed to sell beds. If it's a matter of authorization, Miss Nightingale has a fund at her disposal... - The authorization must come from the Purveyor. That is the arrangement. If you'll excuse me. Come Charles, we must not waste more time. Miss Nightingale? Yes? How do you do? My name is Trevors. My ladies see to Lord Stratford, the British Ambassador. This is Mr. Charles Bracebridge. How do you do, Sir? Is there any way in which I can help? I think not. I have already written the Ambassador but thank you. Your servant, Ma'am. Lord Stratford might be a great help, Flo. Charles, I have written twice. He has not even acknowledged my letters. I do not think the Ambassador has the slightest idea what is happening at Scutari but the Purveyor has. Come, I shall see him at once. You are the Purveyor and the Turkish contractor says that he has an arrangement to supply only you. That is so Miss Nightingale. Then will you please have delivered to me immediately 200 hot water bottles, 2,000 towels and 1,000 beds? The beds are vital. The goods are not in store. All I get from you Mr. Purveyor are excuses. I never make an excuse and I never accept one. Look at your last return. 10 plates, none, bolsters, none, slippers, none, flannel shirts, none. Knives, forks, mugs none. Do you know what I have supplied out of my own private fund? I have no idea Ma'am. Of course you haven't. 11,000 shirts, 2,000 Turkish dressing gowns and over 7,000 knives, forks, spoons and drinking mugs. These are not regulation pattern you know? I see. So the patients are to tear their food with their hands and drink out of their hats are they, until you Mr. Purveyor obtain the regulation pattern? The men are supposed to bring their kit with them when they come in. Do you suppose a man who has had his arm shot away is gonna carry his pack all the way back from the Crimea? Well, I cannot make a second issue. It's against War Office regulations. Perhaps, you as a woman do not understand the necessity of conforming to regulations. I understand rules and regulations as well as you do. I have the strictest regulations for my nurses but they are drawn up with an idea of promoting efficiency and saving life. Not to put a premium on stupidity. Army regulations should be a matter of common sense. Well, of course if you think that Ma'am you don't know the Army. I'm glad to see that you have some trace of humour Mr. Purveyor, but when your inability to produce the goods affects the lives of British soldiers then I do not think that is very funny. Besides, look at the cost of these things. The board would never pass them. I do not care whether the board passes them or not. Rats are running over the men as they lie on the ground and their palliaces are full of lice. I want those beds within three days. I happen to know that they are available. I am sorry Miss Nightingale, I cannot do it. Mr. Purveyor, I order you to do it. I only take my orders from the Treasury, Ma'am. Of course, if you change the regulations... It will be quicker for me to change the Purveyor. Now, that is funny. Unless I get those beds within three days I shall inform the government that if you are not relieved of your post I must be relived of mine. I must meet her sometime. Would you like me to arrange it? No, not just now. I'm too busy. I had a letter from her this morning. The second since her arrival. More sheets, more blankets, supplies of all sorts. She must think the British Embassy is a kind of shop, Sir. Yes. I do wish she'd content herself with reading to the soldiers and whatever her ladies do, not trying to interfere with the organisation. I sent her letters on to Dr. Menzies. These things must go through the proper channel. Yes, Sir. I've just been reading Mr. Gladstone's speech. I think it's the most pompous even he has ever made. You were lucky not to have to listen to it. Every suggestion I make either in the House or out of it is met by Gladstone with continued obstruction. Wars may be fought without money but they cannot be won without it. A fact that Gladstone fails entirely to comprehend. I am sick and tired of this endless battle Liz. I am sick and tired of it. Are you writing to Florence? Yes. Give her my love. Oh, I've already done so. I'd like to send her that letter from the Queen. I'll go and get it for you. Oh, and I've asked to go and see Lord Stratford personally about the "Times" fund. She has some very good thoughts about it. Poor Sidney. He's been shot at from all quarters. Yes, it's monstrous. One would think he was solely responsible for this ghastly war. Salina, I pray for our success so that we may throw these criticisms back in the face of the critics. Knowing you Flo, I've no fears. You will succeed. I have a letter here from Mr. Sidney Herbert. In it there is a message from the Queen which I would like to read to you. Her Majesty says, "I wish Miss Nightingale "would tell these noble wounded and sick men, "that no one takes a warmer interest, "feels more for their sufferings or admires "their courage and heroism more than their Queen. "Day and night she thinks of her beloved troops. "So does the Prince." I thought you would like to hear that. Thank you Madame. Sergeant Burchel. Oh, Private Twist, how are you tonight? Much better Madame. Corporal Wood, I wrote to your wife today. Oh, thank you Miss Nightingale. I told her that you would soon be home. Now, how is the leg tonight? Well, it's a funny thing Ma'am. The one that I've got's all right, lovely, but the one that's gone tickles like hell. Oh, Miss Nightingale, the man who's just been brought into my ward says you know him. What is his name? I didn't hear it. Is he wounded or sick? Badly wounded, shot in the stomach. I don't think he'll last tonight. Where is he? Over here. Miss Florence. It's me Miss Florence, George Winch. George Winch. He is from my home, Embley. George, my father told me in a letter that he had seen your mother quite lately. Ah. She's kept the cottage clean and spotless Miss Florence, after you... Can I hold your hand Miss Florence? It makes it easier. George you will see Embley Park before I will. Oh, I'd like to. Daffodils will all be out now won't they? Yes, the park must be a whole blaze of yellow. Tell me mother I, I did me best. They made me a corporal after Inkerman. Well done George, well done. I'd like to have been head gardener at Embley. Them, them rhododendron bushes need cutting back a bit. I'm glad the daffodils are out. I can see 'em now. I'll stay with him, Doctor. There's no need Miss Nightingale. Miss Nightingale, this is an unexpected pleasure. Have you brought any of your young ladies? I am not here to dance. I wish to see the Ambassador. Oh, well I'm afraid at the moment... Will you please inform his Excellency that I am here at the request of Mr. Sidney Herbert on a matter of importance? Yes Ma'am, I'll tell him. Miss Nightingale? I am delighted to make your acquaintance. I apologise for disturbing your Excellency at this hour but my time is limited. Then uh, be seated. Thank you. Lord Stratford, I have come to ask your help. I have had your letter but quite honestly, I cannot see what help is needed. And the "Times" fund which is quite a considerable amount could I feel be used to better purpose. What better purpose? I have advised Mr. Herbert that I would like to build an English church in the centre of Constantinople, and if the Sultan agrees to this proposal, it will be quite a diplomatic plan. I am not a diplomat Lord Stratford, but I should've thought that the service of God included the service of man. I, I have advocated that the fund be used by houses in Constantinople where recreational facilities can be provided for the convalescing soldiers. Rooms for reading, writing and a good canteen to help keep the men away from the bazaars and the brothels. Really? And do you believe that the men would appreciate such facilities? If I did not Lord Stratford, I would not have suggested it. Then I am afraid I must disagree with you. You see the pampering of these young... Excuse me Ma'am. Your Excellency, word has just come that General Omar Pasha has left the palace. Oh. Well then I'm afraid I, I must ask you to excuse me Miss Nightingale. Of course. Perhaps your Excellency would care one day to come over to Scutari and meet some of our soldiers. I think you would find it illuminating. Yes, I would like to do that, but at the present moment I am extremely busy. And as you know, the political situation here is most delicate. I understand your difficulties. Captain Trevors, will you take care of Miss Nightingale? Miss Nightingale, goodnight. May I escort you to the Embassy carriage, Ma'am? Thank you, I have made arrangements for my own transport. Goodnight. Do you know that 118 men died last night? All in the same ward. Who told you that? One of the orderlies. Just because they don't get enough food. I've asked Miss Nightingale again and again... But you've got to get a doctor's permission Sister Wheeler. You know that. The doctors are just as careless as she is. Are you going out? Yes. I'm going to Constantinople. See if they do anything else there besides scrubbing floors and rolling bandages. Don't you know Miss Nightingale's orders? Yes, I know them as well as you do. Well, if you are going to Constantinople Nurse Johnson, will you please post this for me? But why can't Miss Nightingale control her nurses? Coming at a moment like this that letter may undo all the work she's so far done. This is going to provide plenty of ammunition for the supporters of Mr. Roebuck. Yes, I'm afraid it is. What's the actual wording of the Roebuck motion Lord Palmerston? That a select committee be appointed to acquire into the condition of our Army before Sevastopol and into the conduct of those departments of the government whose duty it is to administer to the wants of the Army. Did you suggest to your aunt that she should send your letter to a newspaper? Oh no Ma'am, it was a private letter. You told your aunt that on December the 20th, 118 men died in one ward. Where did you get that figure? From an orderly Ma'am. As a nurse you had no right to repeat such information, and it is completely untrue. These were the casualties throughout the whole hospital. And when have you seen men starving? Never Ma'am. Then why did you tell your aunt that you had? I wanted to make it look so bad so that then my aunt would send me out a parcel for me own patients. You have caused immense harm both here and in England. Oh, I am sorry Ma'am. I'm so terribly sorry. Sister Wheeler, this is the second time upon which you have allowed your emotions to get the better of you. And in my opinion you are no longer fitted to remain here as a nurse. Oh, please don't send me home Ma'am. Please don't send me home. She's acted foolishly Florence, but not with any intent to do harm, of that I'm sure. Oh thank you Mrs. Bracebridge. That is true Ma'am, that is true. But for the fact that you wrote your letter to a relative I should dismiss you here and now, but Mr. Herbert has asked that you shall remain to appear before a commission of inquiry so that your statement published in the "Times" may be officially refuted. I have been accused of incompetence. Hear, hear! To that I can only reply that I've given everything of which I personally am capable. Hear, hear! I've been accused of indifference. If that is true then I can claim only indifference to the attitude of certain honourable members of this house. Shame, shame! Who have done their utmost to frustrate the work I have tried so hard to accomplish. Hear, hear. I can say little more, but I have attempted to vindicate the government against the charge that has been made. The charge that we have knowingly and as it were with our eyes wide open, suffered our gallant armies in the field to perish. And so Sir, with these feelings I express my intention of voting against the motion of the honourable and learned gentlemen. The battle I can assure you is being fought not only along the shores of the Black Sea, but at home as well. Sidney and Herbert's defence was very sound I thought. That letter in the "Times" about the Scutari hospital, that's what started the debate. The whole country's up in arms. I'd sling 'em out neck and crop. Another pint Charlie! It would be madness to change the government now. Madness. Order, order! Aye's, 305. No's, 148. Aye's 305, no's 148. The aye's have it. You were defeated? Yes. Heavily. Oh, I am so glad. Glad? That's a curious thing to say. Yes dearest, I am glad because now you can go to Spa. Why should I go to Spa? You know very well why. You should've gone months ago. Dr. Ferguson told you. Yes. I knew you were ill but I did not know it was so serious. Ferguson had no right whatsoever to... I know dearest. It was my fault. Well, perhaps it's as well you know. We'll go up to Spa just as soon as I've made arrangements with my successor at the War Office. I don't want Florence to know about this. She has enough to worry about out there. I'm afraid I can't go on any longer Flo. I'm absolutely exhausted. We've been in the saddle nearly 10 hours. Yes, I too am fatigued Charles but here are the hospital huts. We will return as soon as I have seen Mrs. Roberts. Who is it? Miss Nightingale. You have done excellent work here Mrs. Roberts. I'm very pleased. Thank you Ma'am. Being so near the field of battle must have made everything extremely difficult for you. There's still a great deal to be done Ma'am, particularly in the cholera house. Yes, yes I must let you have more help. Have the sisters I sent proved satisfactory? More than satisfactory Ma'am. They're magnificent. Yes, I'm glad to hear that. I... You're ill Ma'am. No, no. Thank you, thank you. I'm quite all right. Just a little close here is it not? If I sit down for a moment I. Oh! Sister! Parthenope. Struggle always makes noise, always Parthe. Oh, you may say it cannot be done Lord Stratford but I say it must be done. - She's been delirious for days Dr. Sutherland. It must be done. It will be done. - The Crimean fever that she has. - There was 300,000 beds that, - There's no doubt about that and badly too. Sidney Herbert ordered them. Herbert ordered them... - Has the family been told? Yes, by telegram. And I wrote to her mother myself. Good. 300,000... Oh, it's a pity but I'm afraid I'll have to cut this off. Pair of scissors Mrs. Roberts, sharp ones. The news of Florence is very bad. Yes, I know. I'm just writing to her parents. If she dies I feel I must take the responsibility myself, for I sent her out there. She will not die Sidney. The prayers of the whole nation are with her. Then God grant that they be answered. We must bear in mind that Mrs. Roberts letter was written three weeks ago, and Flo was passing through the crisis then. If anything should have happened to her, we would have heard by now. If anything happens to her, I shall die myself. No you will not Mama. I shall. I shall not want to live. It's the Commander in Chief. What's he doin' here? Is this where Miss Nightingale is? Quiet man! Don't make so much noise. How is she? She's better. Good, good. Pray, who are you? Merely a soldier. She knows me well. I've come a long way, I must see her. You cannot see her. Huh? Mrs. Roberts, who is that? Lord Raglan. You must not come near me. I have a bad fever. It will be dangerous for you. I am not afraid of fever Ma'am. I've come to tell you you've done a magnificent job. Every soldier out here owes you a debt of gratitude. Now, you're warn out and now I'm going to send you home to recover. I'm sorry Lord Raglan, but when I am well enough to leave here I shall go back to Scutari to continue my work. Miss Nightingale, are you disobeying my orders? Flatly Lord Raglan. Oh, this is rank insubordination Ma'am. Rank insubordination. Oars! Now steady, go very steady. We must take great care of our heroin. For an intelligent man Charles you sometimes talk the most arrant nonsense. In a letter I've just had from my sister, she said you were a national heroine. Well, your sister must've taken leave of her senses. Miss Nightingale, lady? There are two soldiers outside with an owl. With an owl? I'll tell them you can't see them just now. No, no Charles. Please ask them to come in. Miss Nightingale will see you. Corporal Wood and Private Simmons. Well lady, we know you once had a pet owl and it died. We thought you might like to have this to remind you of it. Oh, that is most kind of you both. She is very like Athena. It was at Athens I found Athena. She was a baby owl. She had fallen out of her nest and some children were teasing her, so I rescued her, put her in my pocket and took her back to England. Oh, we became great friends. When she died I was very sad. It is most kind of you. How have you all been at Scutari? Oh, all right lady. But we've missed you coming round at nights, didn't we Woody? Yes, we missed you like hell. Oh, I'm very touched Corporal Wood that you should have missed me like hell. I'm going back home to England tomorrow lady. I'll get me self a good wooden leg. I will write to the War Office about your case and see that you are credited with all your back pay. Thank you lady. And will you give my remembrances to your wife? I will lady. I'll ask her to keep my informed of your progress. You ought really to be going home yourself you know? You're right there Woody. No. No, I shall not return to home until the last soldier has left Scutari and the war is over. Follow me. Private dispatch from headquarters for you, Sir. My Lords? My Lords, ladies and gentlemen, create silence for his Excellency the British Ambassador. My friends, I have just received this dispatch. "The victory of our forces in the field "now being complete and the Russian's vanquished, "a treaty of peace has just been signed in Paris." God save the Queen. God save the Queen! Hip hip... Hooray! Goodbye, George Winch. Your life was plucked like the daffodils you love so much and in the very spring of your years, but you and all those around here have not sacrificed your lives for little or no purpose, because I for one will never, never forget. Goodbye my children. I can do no more for you who have suffered and died in your countries service. Your spirits are with God who gave them. But so long as I live, I shall fight your cause. ♪ Of early years when life was fair ♪ ♪ Our faces sweet and pale ♪ ♪ They poke the angel bending there ♪ ♪ Was Florence Nightingale ♪ I say Woody, what are we gonna give her when she comes home, eh? What are we going to give her? Why, the biggest bleeding welcome anyone's ever had. She may probably be thinking how to escape as best she may on her return. The demonstrations of the nation's appreciation of the deeds and motives of Florence Nightingale. Yes, yes Mr. Gladstone. We all remember Lord Ellesmere's tribute and we're all anxious to accord Miss Nightingale full honours on her return from the seat of war. The question is what are we to do? On behalf of the Army Panmure have you any suggestions? I think Prime Minister, that every regiment of the British Army would like to be there. But as that is impossible, at least the grenadiers in Coldstream can send their bands to meet her at the station. And uh, on behalf of the Admiralty, Sir, we'd like to bring her home on board a man of war. Most gratifying, most gratifying. The government must not fail to take the lead. With her name on the lips of everyone and her praises sung even in the public houses. And then William, when we return to Embley we must arrange a reception there and we must as the Palmerston's and... Don't you think it might be wiser my dear if we waited to hear what Flo wished to be done in her honour? Mama? Yes? When she arrives the villagers want to pull the carriages themselves up from the station. Oh, won't it be exciting? No one don't seem to know when she's a 'comin' Mr. Jenkins. Don't you worry, as soon as gets to Dover on that Man-of-War the whole of England will know. Bigger than royalty, that's the welcome they're gonna give her and so are we in Derbyshire. So we must get all these flags out and the carriage is gonna be drawn by the villagers. It's her Mr. Jenkins, it's her! Why, Miss Florence. How are you Jenkins? I'm very glad to see you again. But we were going to put the flags out for you Miss Florence and... - Oh, were you? That was too kind, too kind. Will you have my luggage sent up to Lea Hurst please? Oh, yes Miss Florence. I'll get the carriage for you. No, no thank you. I wish to walk. Oh, yes Ma'am. The very thought of it is already giving me a retched headache. Florence! - Parthe. - Flo. Oh, my great heart, Flo! Mama. Florence. We didn't expect you. I know Mama. But we are so unprepared. Nothing is ready. Dear Papa. So, you've come home my child in your own way. Yes Papa, in my own way. Now Parthe, go and get the rug and my paisley shawl for Florence. Yes. William dear, ask Watson to bring the calf's foot jelly. Mama, I am not an invalid. Oh yes you are, and now it is our opportunity to show our appreciation of our wonderful daughter. Come along now and sit down. That's right. There now. Put your feet up. Mama! That's right. Your hair, your beautiful hair. They had to cut it off Mama. And your thin little face. You are ill. No Mama, I was very ill but there is no need to worry. I am better now. Oh no. You must not do a thing for yourself. Your work is finished. No Mama. My work, my real work has just begun. This is excellent. We will compile in these notes so of the greatest reforms ever to come by... - What's the use of reforms Mr. Herbert is the War Office refused to put them into operation? Although I am no longer Minister at War, I still feel I can steer many of these through. Meanwhile Miss Florence, you must carry out Dr. Sutherland's instructions. You must rest. I cannot rest. I cannot rest because I cannot forget. While the war was being fought, people here at home lived on the fat of the land, dressed their children in velvets and silks. My children had only a filthy blanket or a blood stained coat when they lived on raw salt meat. I cannot forget that 9,000 of them lying, and from causes which might well have been prevented, in their lone forgotten graves. I stand at the alter of murdered men Mr. Herbert. Day and night their voices cry out to me. Do not ask me to rest. I promise you, anything I can do I will do. Now let's see. Completely reconstruct the Army medical department. All barracks to be put in sanitary or both at home in India. Formulate a new warrant for the training and promotion for medical officers. Formation of soldiers clubs and institutes in India. You know, the only way to get these things done is to have a Royal Commission appointed. I think I have it. You have what Mr. Herbert? Why don't you go and spend a few days in Scotland with your old friend, Sir James Clark? Well what has this to do with the Royal Commission? Sir Jame's house is very close the Balmoral. The Queen would I am sure be sympathetic but she has no power to act. The Queen can I know act only upon the advice of her minsters, but it is quite amazing how often she suggests something to them which they in turn put forward as their own idea. Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness, may I present Miss Florence Nightingale. We have long wanted to meet you personally Miss Nightingale, and to thank you for all you've done for our noble, sick and wounded soldiers. Oh, your Majesty, what I have done for the soldiers has been a privilege. I am grateful indeed to have been given the opportunity. We have been kept constantly informed of your activities Miss Nightingale. We, we can imagine nothing worse then your experiences in the late war. The well being of the soldiers Sir, pertains not only to war but even more to times of peace. Pray, explain. We're very interested. Oh Ma'am, there is so much to be done to overcome to red tapism of the War Office, the cold indifference and the prejudice. She'll be as frank and forthright with the Queen as she has been with us. Of that I'm sure. The Queen of course will return to the Prince for counsel. So much the better. He too has the interest of the soldier at heart. If only you were still at the War Office instead of Panmure. The Bison is not likely to be as enthusiastic about Miss Nightingale and her reforms as you. I agree that the Royal Commission is very necessary if the defects presented to us by Miss Nightingale are true. You may rest assured they are true Albert. I was much impressed by her honesty and sincerity. Yes, and she has a mind very comprehensive. Her views on the Indian Army when made known will cause consternation. Albert? I wish we had her at the War Office. And to recommend that all windows in hospitals show be kept wide open during the heat of the day so as that Miss Nightingale knows nothing at all about the climate conditions of this country. And I cannot agree with her that conditions in India are insanitary. The whole question of sanitation being raised by a lady is indelicate to say the least. I call it downright indecent. Miss Nightingale will not let criticism stop her. She faced and fought criticism from the moment she landed in Scutari. Oh, a friend of hers no doubt, huh? I should be privileged if I could say yes. I merely worked with her during the Crimean War. How jolly interesting. Tell me, what's she like? Some sort of Amazon? Yes, I suppose she must be an Amazon. Who else would nurse cholera and fever cases fearless of contagion for 12 to 18 hours on end? Who else would hold patients in their arms whilst we amputated without anaesthetics? Who comfort the dying and pray for the dead? No offence meant doctor. Just a figure of speech on Vanchoe's part. I'm afraid the Amazon and Sidney Herbert have had their way. The Royal Commission of India has been fed up. Well, who wants to borrow money? A soldier's widow. It's the same story in every detail. I'll send her two pounds. Lord Herbert Ma'am. Good afternoon, Sir. Good afternoon Sidney. Congratulations. Was it difficult addressing the house of Lords for the first time? Difficult? It was like addressing shrouded tombstones by moonlight. Oh. And how is Florence today? Extremely impatient. Oh. Sidney, it almost four years since the Royal Commission was set up and what have we accomplished? Not as much as we'd have hoped for I admit but after all a medical school is an operation. Army pay and allowances have been raised by Parliament. We're also trying to... We cannot sit back with smug satisfaction because during the past few years we have carried through a mere half dozen reforms. The barrack position is scandalous. I see. Well, your listing of recommendations was very good and clear. I made one or two additions. But Florence, I really came to tell you that I'm afraid I shall be unable to give you as much help as I have in the past. My doctor's ordered me away to Spa. He tells me I'm a sick man. Sidney, you have no time to be ill. Do you realise that the rate of mortality in the Army and time of peace is double that of the civil population? In Kensington, the civil death rate is 3.3. A stone's throw away in night's bridge barracks, it is 17.5. Our soldiers are enlisting to death in the barracks. You cannot go away. You, you must do something and at once. Yes, you're right Florence but perhaps I'm not really ill just weak and washy. I'll do a little lobbying with Panmure and Gladstone. You want to go too fast Herbert. After all, much has already been done. That I admit, but many reforms are useless until barrack conditions improve and that's my whole point Lord Palmerston. We should sell those barracks already condemned by the sanitary condition with the money obtained to build new ones. I cannot see why the British soldiers should be pampered at the expense of the tax payer. What do you say Mr. Gladstone? Herbert, when he was in the Cabinet, and I crossed swords on that point many times, but I don't think he understands that I am the custodian of the nation's coffers and of every penny spent for the public good. Surely obsolete condemned properties... I am quite prepared to sell what is useless for it's own purpose. But I contend that the money earned, should be paid into a consolidated fund. But the Army must have better living conditions Mr. Gladstone. There are other matters of equal and even greater importance. Don't you agree? I agree most heartedly with the Chancellor my dear Herbert. It does not do to pamper the British soldier. How little you know of the men who fought at Balaclava and Inkerman. We owe those men a debt and those who come after them. The people like Miss Nightingale and I in my own way are doing our best to repay. But if you cannot see that better living conditions is not pampering, if you will not try, try to... Forgive me I can argue no more. Florence is quite right. Plans for the Netley Hospital are all wrong. The Pavilion Plan is the... Do not talk my darling, it exhausts you. Oh, Gladstone would resent such advice. Yes. He wrote to me today. A most touching letter. He asked me to read it to you. Is it very long? No darling. "My thoughts are ever with you, "and you and he must know that "if not mine alone but universal grief "and love could prevail you would "have no cause to be anxious about him. "Give him my most earnest love, "and ask him to forgive me if "I have ever torn his tender spirit." He's so kind outside the House and so difficult inside it, but he has the courage of his convictions, Gladstone. He is a good man. Yes. Rather like a lobster. Good but disagrees with you. Poor Florence. Our work, our joint work is unfinished. But she must go on Liz. She must go on. She will go on my darling. You must not worry. You know Miss Nightingale, I've often wondered how it is that you have such a wonderful love for the lives of others, and yet care so little about your own life. Dr. Sutherland, I have obeyed your orders implicitly. I do not walk, I do not put my feet to the ground. To conserve my strength for my work I have become a hermit, cut myself off from the world. Miss Nightingale, I feel I must tell you, but unless you stop work at this pressure, you will not live six months. Do you imagine that I have not known that ever since I returned to England? That is why I must go on. Each day may be the last in which I have the power to work. Smithers, I may want you to go for Dr. Sutherland. He's in there with Miss Nightingale now Ma'am. Oh. Ah, Salina. I have just received the report for the first year's progress of the Nurse's Training School at Saint Thomas's Hospital. It is really excellent. I'm sure this will be the means... What is it? Sidney Herbert he, he died early this morning. Dead? Sidney Herbert, dead? I wish I had not been the one to tell you Flo. And I made light of his illness. He will be a grievous loss to you I'm afraid. Few people will know what the loss of my master means to me. You must sit down Miss Nightingale. This has been a great shock to you. My work, the object of my life... The means to do it, all in one depart with him. But your work will go on Flo, it must go on. I was too hard on him. I, I drove him when he needed rest. Don't blame yourself. Sidney Herbert worked with you and for to because he too loved all humanity. No two people every pursued the same object as I did with him. As for our friendship, I doubt if the same will ever occur again. I loved him and served him as no one else. So much to do, so little time to do it. Oh, please God give me the strength to carry out thy work. It's odd that a woman who always expected to die young should have lived to such a venerable age, Sir. Yes, really odd. Let me see, she must be uh, approaching her 90th year. What a great lady she is. A very great lady, now in the twilight of her years slowly fading from life. Ah, here we are. Will you tell Miss Bosanquet that Sir Douglas Dawson is here? She is expecting me. Will you wait in here Sir, please? Thank you. Good morning Sir Douglas. Good morning Miss Bosanquet. I hope my call is not inconvenient. I can see you're very busy. I'm trying to do a little tidying up. Please sit down. Thank you. Uh, how is Miss Nightingale today? She is just the same, thank you. Was she too ill to read His Majesty's letter? Miss Nightingale is not ill. That is to say she's not ill in the accepted meaning of the word. She's just very old and very, very tired. Oh yes, I understand. I think she has right to be tired now don't you? Every right. But I think she realises that a great honour is being paid to her and is pleased. Oh good, good. You know Miss Bosanquet, I used to have a china figure of her on my nursery mantle piece carrying her lamp. How little people know about Miss Nightingale who only know about the lamp. Uh, yes that's very true. The Crimea was only the beginning of her mission as she so often says herself. That was her own plan for the building of Netley Hospital. When the government disagreed and built it their way, it nearly broke her heart. Yes, I was in it once. It nearly broke mine. That is the Nightingale Training School for Nurses at Saint Thomas's Hospital. As her secretary Sir Douglas, I'm trying to sort all these things out into some kind of chronological order. Are all these her own writings? Yes, and eight of them are government publications based on her reports. All this, all this represents 40 years work Sir Douglas. 40 years of fighting to get things done. And what a fighter she was. She and Sidney Herbert between them changed the whole status of the British soldier from being regarded as the scum of the Earth, he has now become a hero and a gentleman. Well, I mustn't delay the purpose of my visit, I have an important ceremony to, I don't find it easy Miss Bosanquet. I can quite understand how you feel. I am commanded by his Majesty Kind Edward the Seventh to bestow upon Miss Florence Nightingale the insignia of the Order of Merit in recognition of invaluable services to the country and to humanity. His Majesty deeply regrets that Miss Nightingale is unable to receive this honour in person. I will see that Miss Nightingale receives it at once Sir Douglas. Thank you. We have had a visitor from the King. You have been given the Order of Merit. You are the first woman to be so honoured. Too kind, too kind. I only did my duty.
