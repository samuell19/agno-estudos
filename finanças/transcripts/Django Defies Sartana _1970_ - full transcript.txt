(horse snorts) - We'll be even more careful from now on, Harry. It won't be easy to surprise Cuervo. - Well, Django, we swept away a lot of dirt over the last few years, haven't we? Today we can win it all or lose it all. Django, we wipe out this bunch of bandits, I swear I'll start raising sows. - (laughs) You've been pulling triggers for so long I don't think you'd know one end of the pig from the other. But I tell you, if we can clean up Cuervo and his gang, we can open up the runs to the east and maybe get back in contact with a little civilization. But it sure isn't going to be very easy to trap a man like him, you all know him, he's an old fox. Any minute might bring an attack. You want to scout for a while? - Give me 100 yards. - All right, let's go. (Western music) (men vocalize) (eerie music) - Ready. (suspenseful music) - Don't bother, he's just a scout and we don't care about scouts. Just let our friend come in closer. (laughs) (laughs) We have to make them feel welcome, eh? (suspenseful music) - Django, I saw some fresh footprints. (men chuckle) They're straight ahead. (suspenseful music) - You can shoot now, amigo. (laughs) (guns fire) (horses whinny) (man groans) (man groans) (horse neighs) (man groans) (man grunts) (man groans) (man groans) (man yelps) - Django, Django! Let's have a party! Go around in back. Tell your men to stop shooting. - Stop shooting, but stay ready. All right, Cuervo, talk. - Now I'm alone, amigo. All my men are dead. I want to fight you man to man, eh? Or maybe you want to murder me like a dog, Django. You mean to say Senor Django's afraid of a fair fight, eh? - Better just surrender. You'll be given a fair trial, I promise you. - Sure, and a rope around the neck. No, no, amigo, that man is not born yet who will make Juan Cuervo hang, I will tell everyone that the brave Senor Django is afraid to fight. - I think you'd better throw your guns down. I'm tired of murdering and shooting. - No, but I will see your body eaten by the coyotes. I am ready, Django. (suspenseful music) Django! Django, I'm waiting for you. (Western music) (guns fire) (man groans) (man groans) (clock chimes) - You're lucky, very lucky, Miss Stern, your property has risen greatly in value since the Cuervo band was wiped out. - I still don't want to sell. - Very well, but I'm afraid Mr. Rosenthal is going to be very disappointed. - I always said that that brother of yours was one to be looked out for, didn't I? Who else but Django could have cleaned up the whole countryside like that, who else? - And in such a short time. - [Gramps] Quit your chattering away, my gold - They say the band was completely exterminated, sir. - Of course, of course, it just needed Django. Now see about those accounts. - Yes, right away, sir. (crowd cheers) (mariachi music) - Why, Django himself, before he went out to tangle with the Cuervo gang, came to me for a sip of this miraculous elixir, only a dollar, friends, just one dollar. (mariachi music) Don't be shy, folks, right, this way, here you are, sir, thank you very much, calm down, ladies and gentlemen, don't worry, there's enough for everybody, just one dollar. (man coughs) (dramatic music) - What the-- - Sartana. (dramatic music) - Sartana! - Stand back, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Eight, nine, 10, stay down. (dramatic music) (bell tolls) (man whistles) - [Woman] Watch out for the little girl! (man shouts to horses) - You leave my daughter alone. - Ho, move on there, hya, hya, hya. (piano music) - No, not that one, Jack, the slower one. (piano music) - Afternoon, I want a room and something to eat. - Yes sir. There you are. Number 13. If you'd like to take a seat, I'll see what we've got in the kitchen. - Right, like that. (piano music) (woman hums along) - This was all I could find, sir, I'm sorry. (piano music) (men laugh) - All right, bartender, get to work. - Hey, that's my tie! - Everybody drinks! - Hold your horses. - Come on, start moving. (man gargles and spits) Ugh, it's rotten. (men chatter) Hey, nigger! Hey! (gun fires) (men laugh uproariously) That calls for another one. - Hello, handsome. - Well, hello. - Coming to hear me, tonight? - Hey, Nance, who's that sitting at the table? - Sartana, you'd better get out. He doesn't much like people like you, you know. You just pay me-- - My goal, I've been waiting to meet Sartana. (man spits) (suspenseful music) Hey! Scarecrow! Go on! Let's mix it up a little. (man laughs) Hey, look, the great Sartana isn't moving, the bad man. He's scared, Sartana, are you afraid I might hurt you? Well? (suspenseful music) (table clatters) (men grunt) (revolver clicks) No! No! (gun fires) (man groans) (group jeers) - [Nance] Run away til you grow up. - [Man] Yeah, run, baby, go tell your friends! - Weigh it again. - All right. (money clinks) We've been doing this for an hour, Gramps. - I told you, so, it's a tenth of an ounce more. Your scale is crooked. Now how much you gonna give me? How much, how much? - I've told you 10 times, it's worth $50, not a penny more. - [Gramps] $50, highway robbery. - Mr. Johnson, the Tucson bank wanted-- - Excuse me, Mr. Singer, about that loan. Yes, you remember, you promised, please. - Yes, yes, come visit me, tomorrow. - I know, Mr. Singer, but you promised me-- - That's right, that's right, come tomorrow. - Excuse me, Mr. Singer, I need your-- (clears throat) I need your signature so I can close the account with the Tucson bank. - I'll look them over this afternoon. Right now will you send Steve Fowell up. - Of course, Mr. Singer. Excuse me, Steve, but Mr. Singer wants to see you. - See me? - Yes, he said right away. - Fine, you can take over Gramps. - That boy's brother is really something, but he's just an ordinary thief, you weigh that gold, Charlie. You'll see there's another tenth of an ounce there. (Steve knocks) - Come in. - You asked to see me, Mr. Singer? - That's right, sit down over there. - Gramps is about to drive me crazy. - He's the oldest gold prospector in the region. He's lost fortunes three or four times through gambling and women. Don't stand on ceremony, sit down, sit down, boy. I've been watching your work for the last few months, Steve and you've been a real help to the bank, so I've been meaning to have a little chat with you. - [Steve] I didn't think I'd been doing anything special, but, well, thank you sir. - Mm. Will you have a cigar, please? Take one. - Thank you, sir. - You're a wide awake lad, Steve, you can tell you're Django's brother, and coming from me, that's a compliment, believe me. (match strikes) Now then, about half an hour ago, I saw Sartana ride into town. That's one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you. Now I'm sure you know who Sartana is, don't you, Steve? - I don't think anybody within 500 miles doesn't know who Sartana is, sir. (exhales) They say that man's the quickest draw in the West, except for Django. - Oh, if Django were here, things would be different, but I'm convinced you can do just as well. This is $3000. Sartana likes to rob banks, they say, so I thought we might save him the trouble, do you understand, Steve? I'll pay Sartana, that's right, pay. I'm going to give him $3000 to get out of town and I'm entrusting you to take the money to him. By the time Django gets back, it could be too late. (Western music) (men vocalize) - So long, Django, and thanks for all the help. (laughs) - Even though Cuervo didn't appreciate it. (men laugh) - All right, then, adios, come to town once in a while. (guns fire) Come on and see us! (men shout) (Western music) (boots approach) - Morning, Jonathan. - Good morning, Steve, shouldn't you be at the bank now? - As a matter of fact, I'm here on work. - What order did you give Sartana? - Sartana? - That's right, Sartana. - Number 13. - Hey, you're dealing with Sartana now, eh? - Uh-huh. - (laughs) Steve the bandit's friend. - Steve the important man's friend. You've heard a lot about Django? Well, you're gonna hear a lot about me, too. (Steve knocks) - Come on in. - Good morning. - Shut it behind you and go and take a seat. What do you want? - For you, eh? - I don't recall having loaned this to you. - Well. It's not mine. It was sent by the owner of the bank here. It's a token of his esteem so you can enjoy a nice vacation in California or Mexico, anywhere, but not here. - Take that money and get out. (gun cocks) Sartana doesn't rob banks. Get out. (Western music) - All right, have a good trip, thank you. - Give it to me, sir. - All right, goodbye, see you on Thursday. - Bye. - Uncle Phillip, I brought these books for Aunt Harriet. - Huh, oh, fine, my dear. (Western music) - Bye, sir, goodbye. (Western music) (dramatic music) - Uncle Phillip! - No, Sartana, no! (gun fires) (man gasps) - Uncle Phillip! (squeals) Put me down! Let me go! (dramatic music) Help! (men exclaim) - Someone call the sheriff! - Sheriff! (dramatic music) - Arthur, you get off the streets. (crowd murmurs) - We found him about 20 miles from here, do you know him? - What do you mean, do I know him? He's Mr. Singer, the owner of the bank. - Was. - Was. - He said something strange just before he died. Mumbled it, you know, it was Steve, I think. - Steve? - Yeah. And then after a minute, Sartana. Yeah, I'm sure it was Sartana. - For it is written, those who are put asunder on earth should be united again in my father's kingdom. Oh, Lord, we are gathered here to bid a last farewell to Phillip Singer, and thy words comfort us for we know that one day, we shall all be gathered at thy side, oh Lord, gather in thine arms the sweet soul of this our brother, who in his life showed us by his example the way to morality and uprightness, amen. In the name of the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. (bell tolls) - It's over. (match strikes) - Let's go. - That's right, the same messenger we sent to the head office-- - I see. - And I might say, we've all been looking forward to your arrival, now I can officially give you the keys to the safe. (lock clicks) - [Man] Is this some kind of joke? - Open up the bank! - Please, gentlemen, stay calm, I assure you, there's absolutely nothing to worry about. Now wait a moment, please calm down, gentlemen, please. Mr. Talbert, Mr. Talbert, sir, we've got to do something, we've got to say something, the crowd's going wild. - This is the end of our bank, there isn't a hope. Whoever it was has completely emptied us out. We haven't got one dollar left. I don't know what to do. - It's already in the paper, look. - Eh? Why doesn't the sheriff get here? - Nobody could've done it but Steve, everybody saw him going to see Sartana, what else could he have been doing there? - I saw him, he said he had a deal to talk over with Sartana, you were there too, John, weren't you? What do you say? - That's right, we all saw him go in there, all of us. - He knew the combination of the safe, think of that, eh, Sheriff? - Don't jump to conclusions, boys, it could've been a coincidence. - Is it a coincidence that the safe wasn't forced open? - And is it a coincidence that Sartana left town right after it was done? - Steve has disappeared, too, no one knows where he is. - It's pretty clear, though, he's gone to meet Sartana. - They were on it together, we've got to find them. (banjo music) (man hums) - Here, darling, go on, drink, it's good. It's good, no? - But Maria? - Go on, it's good beer isn't it. You see, I want you to drink it down. You're a big boy, my own big boy. - Why are you making me drink so? - You are a coyote. I suppose you've had enough of me. - No, never. (woman chuckles) (both moan) (door handle rattles) - We know you're in there, Steve. Get up. Don't move, Steve Farwell. - Oh, hello, sheriff. (laughs) How are you, you're all coming to see Maria, too? - Look what this filthy pig's doing with our money. - All right, boys, start looking around. - We're having a real nice party here, aren't we, Sheriff? - Shut up, you. - I didn't find nothing. - Me neither. - All right, Steve, where'd you hide the money? Answer me, damn you, where's the money? - [Steve] What are you talking about? I haven't got any money, Sartana didn't want it so I brought it to Maria. - All right, you bitch, let's take a look of that. - That's mine. - Shut up and get back. - All right, we got the money. Now let's take it from here. (men shout) - No! Call Django! (men shout) (Steve shouts indistinctly) Don't let 'em get me, give me a chance, will you? (men shout) Leave me alone, no! (sobs) No! Oh, no, please! (sobs) Leave me alone! (men shout) No! (dramatic music) (sad harmonica music) - Howdy, Loco, where's Steve? (sad harmonica music) What is it, Loco, come on, what happened? (sad harmonica music) (dramatic music) - Murderers, get out here, all of you, cowards! Murderers, why, why my brother? (gun fires) Why? - Django, the bank has been robbed and Singer's niece kidnapped. - And what does Steve have to do with all that? Answer me, Sheriff. - He was riding out with Sartana, Django, and the money was found in Steve's room. - I don't believe. Get out of here, Sheriff, or you'll be a dead man too. (somber harmonica music) (Django shouts to his horse) (man laughs) (mariachi music) (man speaks Spanish) - Hey, hombre. - Come here. - You don't like me anymore, eh? (man speaks Spanish) - You know you are always my favorite. (laughs) I'm a very faithful hombre, eh? (woman giggles) (mariachi music) - Come. (mariachi music) (woman sighs) - Querido, I'm waiting. (mariachi music) - Ever seen him? - No. No, porque, no, no. (horse approaches) (horse snorts) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (horse whinnies) - (laughs) Bang on target. (laughs) Bye, Django. (laughs) Miserable owls, they can't leave me alone, even here in this old cemetery. I bet you thought it was gonna be easy to get my gold, eh? Well, I'm real sorry to tell you the truth, son. (revolver cocks) - Have you seen him? - He went riding through here about two hours ago. (revolver clicks back) (Western music) - Stop. This'll only take a minute, I want to have a word with Herman. Herman. - What do you want? - Tell me one thing, I got an idea Sartana's around and I know he'd come to you because you're old friends. Do you know where he is? - No, I haven't seen him. - You're lying. - No, no, honest, Django, I'm not lying, I haven't seen him. - Where is he? (man grunts) Three seconds to answer. - I don't know. - One. Two. - Stop it, I'll tell you. He'll be in Salty River, first house out of town, behind the hill. (man grunts) - Better get going. (Western music) - Ya! - Howdy. - Morning. - Thank goodness. (crowd murmurs) - Here, lady, have a drink. - Thank you so much. (crowd murmurs) - Sartana, listen, bad news, in Tombstone they put a price on your head and Django's out gunning for you. - Django? - That's right, their bank was robbed and they think you're the one who did it. They say Steve was in on it with you. Django knows you're in this part of the country. They'll find you in no time, believe me. Get away. (Western music) - Ya! - Ya! (dramatic music) (guns fire) (revolver cocks) - We'll forget the guns, Sartana. - You're pretty careless, aren't you. (men grunt) (punches land) (guitar music) (man pants) (woman screams) (men grunt) (glass shatters) (suspenseful music) (woman shrieks) - Ah! - It's his diary. I finally met Sartana today. Mr. Singer wanted me to give him some money. - So I would get out of town. - I don't think he's at all what they say. I'd be willing to bet he's honest. If I'm any judge of character. Steve wrote that, on October 13th, 1871, just a few days before the hanged him. - Poor boy, what a way to die. (pants) That clears up a lot, anyway. Someone wanted to make him look guilty. Someone wanted us to be seen together so they could say we robbed the bank. - But why my brother? What would ever make them choose him? - One good reason, Steve knew the combination of the safe, you understand now? - Well, I think we'd better get moving. Got any ideas where to start? - Yeah, at the cemetery. - Did you say cemetery? - You heard me, Django. (man grunts) (dirt scrapes) (Western music) - Didn't really expect to see a body in there, now did you, Django? (Loco wails) (fire crackles) - Then the men all went over to Maria's house and Steve was with her, that's all they told me. - I believe Maria was Philip Singer's girl. - Singer, I'm beginning not to like the sound of that word. - Let's go. - Nothing here either, she must have run away at the same time they were hanging Steve. She's got to have left a trace, something. All right, start talking, where did she go? - To Vera Cruz in Mexico. I mean... She just said she was going, that's all she told me, Django, I swear it. (thunder rumbles) (Western music) - Don Felipe is looking for men who know how to tame horses. He pays in good American dollars, yes, very many horses. Why don't you come? - Who is this Don Felipe? Is the hacienda far from here? (guitar music) - What does it matter to you where this man's place is? The important thing is that he pays. - [Man] Oh, you know I will come, but I never heard of him. - He's new in these parts, but he's full of money. - Get away. - You too. (man grunts) - Let's have something to drink, Paolo. Hmm. - Hey! (Loco grunts) (men laugh) - Thirsty, amigo, have a drink. - Don't waste it. - What's wrong, eh, you don't like it? - 'Course not, he only drinks milk. (men laugh) - Come here, you dog, I want you to show me how good you walk on your paws. (Loco grunts) - Why that dog ain't doing what you said. - Walk on your paws. (gun fires) Come on, you filthy Mexican, start moving. (men cackle) (Loco wails) - [Man] Hey, looky here, I think this dog's mangy. Hey, what do you say, boys, do you know how to cure a mangy dog? - [Man] Yeah, I know how to cure him. I know how to cure him good. - How's that? - You kill him. (men laugh) (Loco grunts) - [Man] Why you dirty, stinking-- (guns fire) (man grunts) - Well, Pablo, I think you'd better give us something to drink. - Hey amigo, who is this Don Felipe? - I don't know him well, senor, he just came a little while ago, he has a very big ranch. - And have you noticed a young girl staying with him, about 19? (man speaks Spanish) - Mad, she stays in her room, but Felipe takes very good care of her and so does Dona Maria. - Dona Maria. - Si, senor. - It's plain enough, Singer did the job and he was afraid his niece would talk so he had her kidnapped, that's the reason he's spreading the rumor that she's crazy and keeping her prisoner. - So if Singer finds out that we're on his trail, the first thing he'll do will be to get rid of her. I've got to find that girl. She'll testify that my brother is innocent. - I've got a little plan. I've talked to some of the hands already. She's been locked in the cell. One of Singer's guards outside, day and night. To get there, you pass alongside the main stable. It's the only way, so I bought you some clothes from one of the bigger payones. - (chuckles) Gracias, amigo. (cow lows) - [Man] All right, hold her still. - [Man] Get that iron over here, will you? (cow lows) (cow groans in distress) - What are you looking for, amigo? - I hear you are looking for men, senor. - You know this one? - Mm, never laid eyes on him. - I could swear-- - You would take me, senor? - All right, you're hired. What about your friend there? Come here, Loco. (speaks Spanish) His tongue was cut out years ago. But he's a good cook. (Loco grunts encouragingly) - All right, go on over to the bunkhouse there. They'll set you up. - Vamos. - We'd better tell the boss. (Western music) (suspenseful music) (man yelps) (horse whinnies) - Johnny, what's going on? Hey, Johnny, where are you? (man groans) (girl sniffles) (mouse squeaks) (gun fires) (girl shrieks) (man laughs) (gun fires) - Now come on, quit crying, it was just a little mouse. Besides, I'm here to take care of you. (woman sobs) (man cackles) That's better, you don't have to be afraid of old Sam. Your uncle told me to look after you. (woman cries out) (mouse squeaks) - No, no. - Come on now, you could be a little nicer, eh? (gun fires) (woman sobs) (man cackles) No sense crying, little girl, your uncle can't hear you and even if he did, he couldn't care less. There, there. - No, leave me alone, leave me alone! (sobs) Oh, no, don't, don't, please! - Shut up! - Please, don't. (sobs) Oh, please let me go. (dramatic music) - Let her go! (whip cracks) Now you shut up, idiot, he didn't do nothing to you. Filthy dog, how often have I told you, I don't want to hear her cry. Put a gag on her, do what you want to her, but I don't want to hear one more sound come out of her mouth. - [Girl] Maria, please help me, I can't stand it anymore. - Now, Miss Maria, I was just trying to keep her calm, but she started yelling, so I had to grab hold of her, didn't I, huh? She's crazy, it's not my fault, she should be tied down. - No, I'm not crazy, Maria, you know that, please. (girl screams) - I suppose you're right, Sam, she must be crazy, but I think I know a way to help. She needs it. Just hold her for a minute. We'll see how much good Dr. Maria can do her. (girl screams) (whip cracks) (suspenseful music) (Maria grunts) (whip cracks) (suspenseful music) (man screams) (suspenseful music) (men laugh) (Django groans) (girl screams) - [Man] How do you get out of this one, Django? (men jeer) - You've had a long trip, eh, Django? Nice to know you, you've come to the end of the road. (men jeer) (girl screams) (man cackles) - [Girl] Leave him alone! (Django gasps) (eerie music) - Make him a little bit dizzy, boys. (man laughs) (man grunts) (man laughs) (eerie music) (man eggs on horse) - That's enough. - Hya! (laughs) (eerie music) (gun fires) (Django groans) (gun fires) (gun fires) (Django groans) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (Django screams) - How many have I shot? - Four, Senor. (gun fires) (Django grunts) (gun fires) (Django cries out) (gun fires repeatedly) - Stop playing around with that bastard, kill him. - Killing is a fine art, my dear. A fine art. (gun fires) (Django groans) Hey, Django, look, I'm gonna skip the next three. (gun cocks) (shells clatter) (gun fires) (Philip grunts) (dramatic music) (gun fires) - Get after them, all of you! (gun fires) (dramatic music) (man groans) Hurry, Maria, take all that you can, we've got to get out of here. (dramatic music) (guns fire outside) (man grunts) (pistol cocks) (man groans) (dramatic music) (guns fire) (eerie music) (man laughs excitedly) (men grunt) (man laughs crazily) (guns fire) (man grunts) (man cackles) - Leave the rest where it is, come on, Maria, hurry. (gun fires) (Philip groans) Sartana! (Maria gasps) - You going, Don Felipe or Singer, whichever you like. You know, I was the one who stole that money, isn't that right? (guns fire) (men grunt) (suspenseful music) (guns fire) (man groans) (Loco laughs) - Never steal from a thief. Oh yes, I believe I'll take that too if you don't mind. By the way, Mr. Singer. There's a friend waiting for you outside in front of the building. I think he has some old accounts he wants to look over with you, probably nothing very important. But I wouldn't keep him waiting too long if I were you. It might make him nervous. Thank you. (spits) Thank you kindly. Oh. Excuse me. (Maria grunts) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (men groan) (gun cocks) Ladies first. (gun fires) (Western music) (gun fires) (Maria whimpers) (gun fires) (both whimper) Django, he's all yours. (heroic music) (gun fires) (gun fires) (Philip groans) - I'll get you yet, you filthy-- I swear I'll get you. (groans) (heroic music) (revolver clicks) - No, no, Django, don't! You never were a killer. - Tie him up. - Here, quick, Philip, shoot him down, shoot him down! (gun fires) (Philip screams) (dramatic music) No, no, I don't want to die, I don't want to die. Don't kill me. (gun fires) I want my jewels, give me back my jewels. (gasps) (horse whinnies) No! (gun fires) No! (grunts) (gun fires) (Maria grunts) No, no, don't kill me, don't kill me! (horses whinny) (Maria screams) (dramatic music) Oh no! (girl screams) - No. (sobs) (horse whinnies) (acoustic guitar music) - Whoa. Where's Sartana? (acoustic guitar music) Well, I suppose he's already left. (Loco exclaims) - 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. 32, 33, 34, 35, well, I'll be. There's 15,000 missing. (laughs) They said a robbery of 50,000. I tell you it's getting so you can't even trust bankers anymore.
