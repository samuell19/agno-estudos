Vandalism at the Maryland School of the Arts. Are you a student there? No. I see you've been in this court room several times before. Where are your foster parents? Can you answer me with a sentence. I don't know, I think my foster mom's trying to get off work. Okay, Mister Gains look... This is the way we play the game here. You break it, you buy it. 200 hours of community service to be performed... at the scene of the offense. Maryland School of the Art. I got here as fast as I could. We're back! What'd he get? 200 hours community service. He won't make it, he's never stayed with anything in his life. Why do you care. You get your check every month. Kids, wash up. What'd you say? Slow down, slow down. You'll make him all dizzy. He's not even drunk yet. Come on, let's have a nice dinner before I have to go back to work. I'm not hungry. Are you going to prison? How many times do I have to tell you, just to knock. Because that's where my Dad is. At the Supermax, but he liked it better at Jessup. No Camille, I'm not going to prison. But they are going to have to take me to prison if you don't start knocking. Get outta here... Excuse me... I see, we were hoping to link the fundraiser to the fall showcase. So we absolutely can't do it on Friday. I'm Tyler Gage, I'm here... Come in, Mister Gage. Take a seat. We'll just have to move the event to March and hope that the press comes through. Thanks Denise. Well I see that you're overwhelmed with remorse. You have no idea of the consequences of your actions. Do you? Yeah, 200 hours. Actually there's a little more to it. Most of our students are here on Scholarships. The cost of repairing the damage that you did. Is roughly the equivalent of one student's tuition. Do you understand what that means? You just cost someone their future. Sorry... Look, I'm just here to do my hours. Is says here that your school day finishes at two. Per the court's order, you're to report here and stay until 5:30. Now if you'll follow me Mister Gage. I have someone who is very eager to meet you. Mr. McCaffery. Director Gordon. This is Tyler Gage. Your new intern. I'd like a daily report on his activities. All right, here you go. 4, 5, 6... and... 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and... Ahh, hello. Who is that? Come on, he is fine. Don't you have a boyfriend? Yes, and my boyfriend would appreciate my good taste. Hey. Hey. Good job! So I'll see you at rehearsal, okay Andrew. Yeah, see ya. Hey baby. Hey. Walk you to your next class? Yeah. Just need to stop by my locker first. How are you? Good. How was class? It was good. Hey guys, is that our new janitor? He's not a janitor... That's the guy who trashed the theater. Really? Ohh... I love a man in a uniform. Hey, you in the garbage man jumpsuit. When you're done with that how about a wash and wax? You all better cool out with that. I know that car belongs to somebody. Of course it does. That's why we're going to leave it here for you to drive over to Omar's. And make sure he pay us for the last car we brought him. What's up man. Man, look at this thing, man. It's got plastic fenders. What's up with the girls here man. Damn... they look like the girls from the Candy shop video. They might look like them, man, but they don't dance like them. Oh yeah, so you been workin' them out? I've been workin' them out. I've been like... So what do they do? Hey yo', what did they do after that? Oh my God, can you stop thinking about... the senior showcase for like, one second, please. One second... It's not just that. It's everything. Nora... Nora... Look got a track for the showcase. Same tempo, same rhythm as the track you got now. I really believe this will take your routine to the next level. Next level? Yeah... Thanks Miles. Nora, listen... It's not that you're not already at the next level, you know what mean... Quit while you're ahead Miles, just stop. And you, you just need to stop and take a breath or something... because you're starting to make me nervous. I know, I'm must stressed. You need a break, Colin's playing on Saturday night... so you need to come, because you haven't been in forever. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Who's Colin? Lucy's older boyfriend. He's sophisticated, a real man. A real man. He's about to be surrounded by a whole lot of real men when he goes to jail. How long have you had your license, 6 months, I am very mature for my age. Thank you. Oh that's great. That's so perfect for the witness stand. When are you going to stop changing the music, Miles, she's already freaked out. Nora, come on. Just go. Just go. They got that. Tired of getting dawged on yet? Oh yeah. Let's go. Mac? Mac... Where my money at baby! Where my money at! Hey! That's wonderful Jack, congratulations. You're late. Not really... No? You're just so eager to get to work... you're just sprinting off to the supply closet. It's like 15 minutes, don't I get a grace period or something? You've neither earned one nor are you entitled. But you can stay 15 minutes later. Andrew, oh my God, what happened? Came down on my ankle wrong in class today. Are you okay? Yeah. It's just a sprain. Nurse says I have to stay off of it. I'm sorry. For what, it's not your fault. I know Nora, but it's just that the showcase means a lot to both of us, you know. Maybe you could find somebody to rehearse with in the meantime. I should be back before you know it. Yeah, don't worry about it. I'll be okay. All right, cool. See you later. Okay. What's up man. What's up. Where you from? I grew up in McCulloh Homes. Oh word. That's where my boy Maccy's from. He lives over at Heritage now. Oh yeah. I don't live over there no more. I live with my Aunt now. Right on, I'll check you later. Later. He only has a bad sprain... I just need someone to rehearse with until he gets better. You know all the stuff I have going on with the labels and everything. How come Miles can find the time to help me out. No offense to Miles, but he's not as involved in every aspect of the music as I am. Look, all I need is somebody, Brett... to rehearse with, just for couple of week. I want to help you, you know I do. I'm just so close with my music... I got to give it everything I have. You're gonna do great. You always do. Yeah. All right sweetie. Thank you guy so much for coming to the audition. Ready? I'm not ready yet. Thank you... See, it's not that hard. No... Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. I'll do it. Do what? I don't know, whatever you all were trying to do out here. You want to lift me? Are you kidding? Does it look like I'm kidding? Okay, I get it. You're not going to use me to get out of cleaning the window. Even if you were capable of dancing. Okay, well I'm not trying to get out of anything. And I know you saw me the other day. Thank you, but umm... I can find someone else. I was just trying to help. Okay, wait. Catch me. Now what? Put me down. No. What about Craig Raffen's solo. I don't have time to work out a solo. Not a good one anyway. Well have you talked to the sophomores? I've auditioned a bunch of them. None of them can handle it. My dance has a lot of lifts in it. And you know how hard... I can't believe there's no one else. None who have the time. And you say that he can dance? He's adequate. Adequate? See that's my concern. He's not taking this seriously. Look, I'm sorry. It's just you're all talking about dancing like it's rocket science or somethin'. It's just for a couple of weeks. Until Andrew gets better. Yeah. This would be your risk, Nora. It's your Senior piece. I know. Don't make me regret my decision. 2:30 tomorrow, bring your tights. Tights? Wait... What? I'm going to beat you. I have... Anything interesting happen at school today, Tyler? Malcolm, enough! No. Sit down. Eat... Anything special at school today? I found a new rehearsal partner for the showcase. So now I won't miss a beat when Andrew gets back. Your applications arrived today for Cornell and Brown, I put them on your bed. Remember our deal, Nora. If you don't get a job from the showcase... you got to school in the fall. Okay... I'm not late. You're not dressed either. You can change in the bathroom. Done. I asked you to bring tights. Do I look like I own tights? Shoes? Move better with them on. Aren't you afraid you might slip and fall? All right, how do you want to do this? I'll start with a combination. Okay... Step knee... step fan... step, turn... change, contract. Okay. I'll take it slow. And... step knee, step fan... and... you got that? Yeah. Start with the fan... turn, change, contract. Okay. Let's do it again. 5, 6, 7, 8... Step knee... My bad... So... Go. Step knee... fan... Wow... He looks like the real deal. Take a break baby. Grab a coffee. I can't... I have a lot to do. How's this day job? Brett... I'm sorry, you got a problem? No. No, I'm all about rehabilitation. Because we could discuss this outside if you like. Why do you think you're so tough. Why don't you test me. Okay, stop! Brett, everything's okay. All right. I'll meet you later. Okay. Okay. What? Again. And... Omar! Your boys are here! Look what we got you man! What's up baby. Hey man, I heard you havin' a party on Friday. Yeah, you know we up in there. No. You dude's is froze out. Especially after what happened last time. What you mean, we froze out? Come on man, you know I ain't even start that. That was P.J. That ain't even right, man. Look, we can take this car to Stucky. Probably get more money, too. I'm sorry, yeah... You could take this car to Stucky's... You know something, Mac? You young dudes, man... you ain't got no respect. No loyalty. Matter of fact... why don't you... bring me back an Escalade or something, to get back on my good graces. We just got you this car... An Escalade! Or something! Yeah, we'll get you an Escalade, man. I'm sorry, what did you say? Yeah, nothing... So, can I still come to the party? Skinny, come on! He didn't say nothin' about me. He said you all couldn't go to the party. Nothin' about Skinny. Nothin'. Will you shut up! Ready, down... up... step... turn... Pique... What the Hell is a pique. This is a pique. We do the turn, and land face to face. Okay? I get it, I get it. - It's just... - What? It's just this... This whole thing is stiff. And it's boring. Boring? Yeah, don't look at me like I'm stupid, I know, you know what I'm saying. Fine, then that's the way it is. Fine. Ready... And... Down... Up... Step... turn... pique... And... Like this? Okay, I am starving! Tyler's just here until Andrew's back. And why is this the first time I'm hearing about it. We still have work to do. I can't watch, is he that bad? Tell me! Good bye! Okay. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. All right, and I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Listen, can you just come to the club and hear me sing with Colin on Saturday. Maybe you can bring Tyler. Will you stop talking about how hot he is. Okay, Brett's not around so... Why do you keep denying the obvious. It's so obvious. Okay fine, Tyler's good looking. But he's annoying. See, your guard's up, and that must mean you like him. You couldn't be more wrong. And defensive too. That must mean you really, really like him. I'm just saying. Oh look, Miles sent me another MP3. Oh, better listen to it now, because you know he'll be calling you in five minutes asking you what you think. You know you've been getting on Miles case a lot lately. Because he's irritating. Defensive, wait, what does that mean again? Just listen to the track, okay? It's good. Whatever... Sorry! What's next. Lena got Captain Crunch. Peanut butter Captain Crunch. Told ya' she likes us. Camille, get outta here. Fine. Camille? Come here. You gonna give me a little bit of that? One bite. One. One bite. Hurry up. That was the biggest bite I've ever seen! Get your own! I spit on that spoon... Yeah, now you give it back! What? What is this? That's a sliding scale. What's does that mean? That means, I score more points that you, so I get more money than you. No, no, no. What about my assist. I was droppin' dimes today. Man you tripped over your own shoes. Twice... but you rolled out of the second one pretty nice. You played it off pretty cool. Man, all I know is you better give me some of that money. What? Yo' it's getting kind of late, I got to bounce. Hey, wait, hold up. Well give you a ride. Yo' let me do it this time. Skinny, you the look out. Well why can't I do it this time? Can you do it? Yeah! Let him do it then. You know what, here you go tough guy. You see that car right there? Go get 'em. That car's got an alarm on it. I know. I know. I told you that alarm was going to go off. Wait a minute, you all set me up! Hang on. I got us one. You should have saw your face. That was good. Play it back, Miles? I like that. Nora. Yo... look who's here. Sorry bro', closed studio. Okay bro'. You're an hour late. Yeah, my bad. I got caught up. For an hour? Yeah, I had some things I had to do. Look, I'm sorry. Can't we just rehearse now? No, there's other dancers in the studio now. We can't. Why you getting all mad at me, I'm here every single day. Look, I said I'm sorry. Yeah well, sorry's not going to cut it. Yeah... we're working here man. Some of us take this seriously. Where were you! Where was I when? When we were supposed to be rehearsing? Oh yeah, I don't think that whole rehearsing thing is going to work out for me. What the Hell does that mean! That means I'm out. What? Are you kidding me. You're going to quit without even talking to me about it? Yeah, I'm sorry. Look, I got to get back to work. I can't believe this! I can't believe I trusted you! That was so stupid! People make stupid decisions everyday. Besides, it didn't look like you needed me anyway. Mac you better get your feet off the table. Hey shut up. I ain't gonna move my feet. Marcus, get your feet off my table. I told ya' boy. Mom! Don't you leave this house. I don't want to hear about any of you getting into any trouble. We ain't goin' nowhere mom. That's right, I'll be back home in time to make y'all breakfast. Bye mommy. Bye Mrs. Carter. Ow man! Look, look... Weak crossover. Hey, you think you're as good as these guys. Please... Why don't you try out? For the And 1 team? Why would I need to do that for? I don't know. I always thought you should've played for the school team. The school team? Yeah, right. They suck. Maybe they wouldn't suck if you played. Man, what is this, part of your community service or something? What ya' gonna say next? This is your brain on drugs? Man, the Hell with that? I'm just sayin'... All right man, just drop it. I don't see you out trying to do nothin'. You quit everything you start. And you know it. That's me right there... Nora? Where have you been? It's getting late. Where do you think, mom? You've been rehearsing a lot lately. What about your other school work? Rehearsing is the most important part of my school work. It's kind of the whole point. Sweetie, I just don't think that dancing... Dancing is what, mom? What do you know about it anyway? When was the last time you saw me dance? That's not fair. Well you know what, you don't have to worry about it anymore. Because the guy I've been rehearsing with for the showcase he quit today. So basically, I'm screwed. You might get your dream after all. Nora. Wait a minute. Will you hold on a second. Look, I just... wanted to say I'm sorry about yesterday. What's the matter? Don't feel like mopping any floors today? Look, can you just give me a break. Do you have any idea how important this showcase is? Who is going to be there? I don't know. People? People? Important people, from every major dance company in the country. Without this showcase, I have nothing. I go nowhere! Okay. All right, I get it. I know all about having nothing. It sucks. Yes it does. So are we going to go back to doing this? - No. - No? I don't trust you. Then what do I got to do to prove it you? Look, I'll do anything. Anything? Up and... grand pile all the way to the ground. Back up, and reach your arm up high... touch the sky, down to the floor... touch your toes. And back up. And point and second. And pile... good. Pile, and... up. I thought she was going to slap me in my face. This is me. Okay, why are you teaching ballet class? Doesn't look like you need a job. Oh you know, just puts off coming home a little longer. Oh, it couldn't be that bad. My mom doesn't really get the whole dancing thing. What about your Dad? He died a couple of years ago. Sorry. No... it's okay. He was the one who always encouraged me, you know? I'd meet him a rehearsals. Watching all my routines. Sounds like a cool dude. Thanks for walking me home. Later. Bye. Hey look, look. There's a game tomorrow at the courts. Those cats want a rematch with us. You down? I can't make that. I got community service every day this week, man. Hey, put that away, what are you doin'? What's up between you and Lucy. Looks like she's kinda feelin' you. I don't know about that. What, you scared? Okay, this Colin is too old for you. He's so... Cheesy? Romantic. Okay? He's romantic. Why isn't Nora using this? Man, Nora's old school. I ain't talkin' Sugar hill Gang... I'm talking Vivaldi old school. For real... I think you should let her listen to it. Hey Nora... Come here for a second, I want you to hear something. Don't start. I'm just saying, you guys get along well... He's my partner. He's just your partner. And too many things. Miles got a... what's that? Violin? Violin. Some kids to play violin on the track. Finally working with people that can actually play instruments? Hey, I can play all right. I just prefer to play with myself. What? He makes it too easy. No, not play with... Just listen. I like it. I really like it. That's good. I told you dawg. Hey, I was thinking... You know that... You know that turn, where we got the leg behind us? Yeah? What if... what if I went down and... we like change levels. I don't know... I don't mean to be out of line. It's cool... I like it, let's try it. 5, 6, 7, 8... 1, 2, 3, 4... That's actually really good. Cool. Maybe we should do it. Let's try it again. 5, 6, 7, 8... All right then, I guess I'll just see you tomorrow. Okay. You need a ride? Umm, have you ever been out to Hampden? No, but there's a place I go near there. I'm serious, where are you taking me? Hold on, I'm about to show you. Is this... is this where you kill me? Funny... This is it. I got a view just like this, from my balcony. You do? No. How did you find this place? I've been coming here since I was a kid. My dad was an executive at one of the shipping companies. This is where I imagined my whole routine. I don't know how you do it. Don't you think about how two people are going to move. I don't know, every detail. I couldn't do that. Well you've been doing it. It's not the same thing though. Well that's how it starts. You know I always saw this routine... with a bunch of other dancers. What do you mean? Well, if I had enough dancers. I could have them all starting in unison. And then slowly breaking out in a canon. Whoa... What's a canon? You know, like row your boat? Okay. I'll show you. You know that phase with the turn and lift. They all have turn and lifts. All right, what, in the middle section? Yeah, I know it. Okay. Well, instead of doing it together. You're going to go first. - Come on. - All right. We go on 1. 5, 6, 7, 8... I think... look... You started with a bunch of dancers... You should do it with a bunch of dancers. Okay, and where would I find these dancers? You do go to a school that's just busting with kids in tights. Why don't you take your pick. The only ones left are sophomores and freshmen. There's no way... any of them are good enough. How do you know if they're good enough or not? You didn't know I was good enough. Well, who says you are. Yo', let's go man. No, man, I'm late for my hours. What about our game. Yo' I'm going to have to do it tomorrow. You said that yesterday. I'll catch you all later. Now I'm gettin' pissed. How many did you say you needed? Thanks Miles. So umm... that's basically what we have so far. Congratulations. You've really expanded your range. I thought your original piece was good. But this... This is very risky, Nora. But it may pay off. What made you decide to change your piece. Actually a lot of this is Tyler. Naw, that's all you. Okay fine, he gave me some of his moves and I gave him ballet lessons. You studied ballet? He's actually pretty good. He could be a student here. Unfortunately our school year has already begun. But, keep up the good work. Miles? Miles! Not right now, all right. What's wrong? Miles? Miles! What's wrong? I just heard you guys got signed. You heard wrong. Everybody saying Brett got signed... Brett got signed. He signed without me. How did he get signed without you? Well according to him, the Label thought he was the only talent. So they want to put him out as a solo artist and get him to work with other producers. Oh my God. And you know what... I knew Brett had an ego. I knew he did. But damn I thought he'd sit me down and tell me like a man. I knew it. Hey baby. Is that why you flew to New York last week? Whoa. Whoa Nora, calm down. You ditched Miles. After all the work you did together you dump him just like that. Come here... Not just like that, all right. You haven't even heard my side of the story. Right. 'Cause you don't even have time to call your girlfriend... and tell her the news. I have to find out through everyone else. Nora, come on. I'm sorry. I didn't expect it to happen like this. It's just happening. All right, like we always talked about. No, we never talked about stepping on our friends to get there. When someone hands you your dream, you take it, you don't ask questions. I would. You think you would. But you don't know until it's right in front of you. Seriously Nora, would you have walked away. I don't know, but I'm walking away now. What, you're breaking up with me? Yes! This is about me, or Miles or any of that. It's about Tyler, isn't it? No, it's about me, Brett. Fine. Just remember that loser is headed nowhere fast, and you know it. Mrs. Gordon? Director Gordon? Can I help you Tyler? There's somethin', I kinda wanted to... It's probably stupid... Then perhaps it can wait. Okay, you know how me and Nora been working together. Yes. It's been kind of making me think lately... That maybe I'd like to come here. You want to apply to the school? Yeah, kids transfer don't they? I was kind of hoping, maybe... I don't know, maybe finish out my school year, here. It's not that you don't have talent Tyler. But a lot of kids have talent, take so much more than that. This is a grueling program. My students work themselves into the ground, everyday... just to get even a fraction closer to their goals. And we're tough as Hell on them in here, because we know what they're going to face out there. The only kids that make it are the one prepared to fight for it. Yeah, I understand that. I'm not sure that you do. Not for something real. I've already seen you give up once already. That's not going to happen again. Saying the words, doesn't make it so. Okay, then tell me what I got to do. I can't. You have to show me. Show me that you want it. Really want it. You do that... and we can talk. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 3:00. Hey, come on, man. Would you snap out of it. All right, the way I look at it, Brett did you a favor. Yo', your beats are hotter then what he can do with them anyway. Come on man... I got to sit up here and watch this Colin. Sorry, did we come here for him? I thought we came here for Lucy. Is that who you been looking at this whole time? He is kind of hot, I guess. In a weird way... if you like that. Shut up. Shut up. Thank you, we're going to take a break and be back in five. I got to get up outta here man. Hey guys... You umm... met my boyfriend. Hey man. I'm Colin. Tyler. Nice to meet you man. This is Miles. What's up man? Miles? Hey this is the guy you were telling me about? Yeah, she said you played man... I got a set up if you want to join us. I left my G4 at home, man. It's in his bag... Yeah? Come on man, we'll set up. Ready Luce? Dude thinks he's slick. Coming at me with that reverse psychology shit. He seems kind of cool to me, man. That's part of his whole game. Why don't you just go play. Hey. Hey, I didn't think you were going to come, after everything that happened... That's exactly whey I wanted to come. What are you doing here? Miles needed a wing man. What's he doing up there? Trying to be the bigger man. Okay... You look beautiful. Thank you. Everybody ready, let's do this! I didn't know she could sing like that! In her words she majors in dance, 'cause she already knows how to sing. Kill her Miles. So you gonna ask me to dance? I didn't know you could dance without your tights. You don't know what you've gotten yourself into. What is that... Come on! All my ladies! Move it to the front... Show 'em what ya' got! Fellas... Everybody dance! Everybody dance! Come dance with me! I swear I have never seen that many people here before! Get used to it. Come on you guys, let's take a walk by the water. Come on, let's walk. Let them go. Let them go. You're going to make me say it, aren't you? Make you say what? I know I've been hatin' Colin. But he was good. He was real good. Some one who's so sophisticated. You always get off lightly. You know, you were umm... pretty good yourself Miles... Just a little bit... I try to do... What? Umm... Umm... Don't worry about it. Lucy... I got to go. I'm gonna go check our sound vels. That place is... That place is crazy. Is it always like that? Yes. But tonight, Miles and Lucy were on a whole other level. You weren't so bad yourself. You all know exactly what you want. Well what about you, what do you want? I don't know, nothing... Come on. What about when you were a kid. All kids want something. For me, it's just... it's better not to want anything. That way if it goes away or doesn't happen. You know, it doesn't matter. But you want something now, right? Like maybe to go to MSA. There's a lot of things that I want now, that I didn't use to. I even catch myself, every once and awhile... actually thinking I could have them. Please don't kick me out I brought you orange juice. Bill and Lena went out, you're baby sitting. Thank you. Why are you always so tired lately? Because I've been working a lot. Doing what? Why do you ask so many questions? Just... No, no, never mind. Don't answer that. Just go get Malcolm's shoes on. All right. Throw it! You got it, you almost got it. Dancing. You can't dance. You can't dance... You've never seen me dance. Then, do something. Do somethin'? Okay it was fine, it was okay. What was that? - What was that? - It was nothing. Where did you learn that from? I'm not throwing anything until you show me what that was. All right. All right. All right... If you can do that, you can do this. I love it. You got that... Hit... Hit... Okay, let's try it. So you got the whole thing? Yeah. Okay. All right. On go. Go. 1, 2, 3, go. What... Running man? You don't know nothing about that. Malcolm, can you do the Running Man? Yeah! Oh yeah! Here we go! No! No! No! This is you? Don't be mean, I was a chubby kid. What are you saying? That if I was like that right now, you wouldn't like me? Oh no, I could deal with the chubbiness. Just if you were missing those two front teeth, I don't know if I could work with that. Thank you very much. You know I was thinking... We should talk to Director Gordon... about using the showcase as your audition to get into the school. I don't know, do you think she'd go for that. It's about going after what you want, right? Mom! Umm... Hey... I didn't know you were home already. This is Tyler. My rehearsal partner. Nice to meet you Mrs. Clark. You have a beautiful home here. Thank you, we certainly like it. I should probably get... get going anyway. Thanks for showing me those pictures. It was nice to meet you. All right, here we go. Ready, 1, 2, 3, go! - Hey. - Hey. What's up? Umm, look about the other night. You didn't tell anybody, did you? Naw... Because it's just musicians, whatever. You ain't got nothin' to explain to me. Whoa, what's wrong, why, why are you talking to me like that. You want to be with someone who doesn't appreciate what a good thing he's got. That's a hundred percent your business. I just thought your were smart enough to know you deserve better. Excuse me. All right, let's move it out even more than that. I want it to look pretty... All right. Go. Wait, hold up, hold up. Tell me I'm not seeing this Ty'. Mac... Hold on Mac. Yo' wait up a second. What you doin' man? What was that, Riverdancin'? You gettin' down with your Irish roots now? It's not like that... It's not like what? It's part of my community service, man! Dancin'? How is dancin' a part of your community service, Ty'? It's complicated. Well explain it to me brother, 'cause I ain't that stupid. Fine... Look, you were supposed to meet me at the courts two hours ago. Then I come over here and I see you blowing me off for this? This? We ain't been hangin'. You ain't been callin'. Why? 'Cause you leapin' around here with a bunch of rich kids! They're not all rich in there, it ain't like that, man. All right, Mac, hold on. There's this girl. Look she asked me to... rehearse with her for the showcase thing. That's all. So you messed around with our friendship for a girl. So it's like that. That's a relief, Ty'. Come on, man. Wow. That was quick. That's great. Hey Tyler. Hey. What are you... are you back? Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better. Thanks for filling in for me man. Can you give us a sec'. Sure. - Hey guys. - Hey. Good? Yeah. Definitely. I didn't think he was coming back, he hasn't even been here. I don't know what to do. So, he's back. Where does that leave me? You don't have to say anything. Wait, what does that mean? I can't believe I bought into all this bullshit. You're really just going to turn your back on me? That's not what I'm doing, Tyler. Andrew is a student here, he's a senior... You're just like Brett... - You just use people and then you dump them. - What? Why are you making it sound like that... is not even the same situation. And you know it! How is it not? Have I just been filling in for Andrew? That's not fair. I'm out. Tyler! Tyler wait, give me a second to figure this out. Yo', what's up Ty'. Yo' man! Hello? Hi. Ahh, is Tyler there? May I ask who's calling? It's Nora. Nora? No, he's not here. Yeah, umm... just tell him I called. Okay. 5, 6, 7, 8... 1 and 2! 3, 4! Andrew, are you all right? Okay, try walking on it. I can't do this Nora. What? You and I both know I can't pull this routine off. Here mom. Nora... I bet you can't make the shot. Bet you I can. Whatever man. Right, whatever. Now let me do it. You suck man. Hey yo' Ty! What's up? Where you been man? Nothin', around. Yo' man, just give me my ball back. Ain't you gonna be late for ballerina class. No, man. I'm through with that. So what happened with that girl? Nothin'. Nothin'? I'm supposed to just believe you? Yeah, man. You are. I don't know. Man turned his back on his boy... Deserves a second chance. All right? Come on man. Party tomorrow night at Omar's, man. That's my man! Mom? Are you okay? You know, even when you were a baby... you could dance, better than you could walk. It's all you ever wanted to do. I still remember the look on your face your father and I took you to... your first dance class. You do? I never expected that dancing would bring you such joy after all these years. Seeing you up there on the stage, so happy... used to make me happy. I guess I forgot about that. Mom, it's okay. I am so excited to see you dance in your showcase. Mom... I don't even have a partner anymore. Tyler's not doing it and Andrew's out. Baby... You can do this. You've been doing this by yourself your whole life. Come here. You are going to be great. Thanks mom. I'm still going to win. Yeah, we'll see. All right, whatever. I'll come back. What you all up to tonight? Oh... We just goin' over to Omar's to watch the movies. Yeah. I know all about your movies. You're staying here, you understand? What? Ma, I got to go last time. Yeah, I know, and that's why you stayin' here tonight. You boys make sure... my baby don't go no where, you hear? - Yeah, yeah. All right mom. - Yes ma'am. Hey, don't worry, I'm gonna tuck you in before you leave, all right man. Hey, shut up. Hey Man! So this the spot right here. Yeah. It's tight. Yeah, right. I don't know, so what's been going on. Man, everything cool. Nora's good. Yeah? Her boy Andrew quit though. What you mean Andrew quit? Yeah, he got hurt, can't dance with her anymore. Damn... Whatever man... Man, yeah... whatever... Why don't you stop the bullshitin'. I bet you've been mopin' around just as much as she has. What you mean, she's been mopin'? I ain't sayin' nothing man. Did you see a tear? Mopin'. Shut up man, let me introduce to you somebody. My man C'. This is Mac. I started tearing up like a little girl, tellin' him... that I go to the school of the arts. Wait, wait, hold up... You go to the MSA. Yeah. - That's how you all know each other? - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You don't look like no art school cat to me. What the Hell is an art school cat supposed to look like? Miles Davis... Tupac. Mobb Deep... Those cats went to art school. I'm just sayin'... You know what man? Just shut up. Yo', what's up! Yo, yo, yo. What up, how you all doin'! Skinny! What are you doin' here! Man, I'm doin' the same thing you is doin'! Come on, let's go. Out the door. Go. Go! - What are you talkin' about man! - Move! Move! Let me be here man! What's wrong with you! Let's go... What's up baby! How you doin' man? Look here... matter of fact, here. Here's some bus money. Go home. Man, why I got to leave? What you talkin' about! No, no, no... Go home Skinny! Man, let me in! What you all laughin' at! What up Skinny! Don't touch me! I'll be back, watch the car. Be right here P.J... I can't be at the party... Hey yo', get me a 40. What you got in the bag? My music. Well do some then. You want me to go show him some? Yeah. DJ, can I get up on your table real quick. You're supposed to be watching the car! I told you to watch the car man! Come get me. Yo', you see what your little brother is doin' outside Who? Your little brother, man! He won't listen man! Hey yo, Mac size... Bring the girls out here! Yo' that's P.J.'s truck man! Skinny, get out of that truck man! Man, why! Yo', I said get out! Hey man, let's go get him! Skinny! No! No! Skinny! Skinny! Say something! Say something! Say something! Talk to me! Talk to me! Talk to me! Call somebody man! Do something! Call 911! Get up! Get up! Hey. How long you been out here? I don't know. How's your mom? She spoke to me for the first time today. Hey, you know they got P.J., right? Yeah, but that's not going to bring Skinny, back. This ain't your fault, you know that right? That won't bring Skinny back either. Look, I just hate seeing you beat yourself up like this. I'm beating myself up? We'd been beatin' ourselves up way before Skinny... Look, Skinny's dead! He's gone! My little brother's gone. And that's on me, Ty'. I know that. I ain't stupid. All the partyin', stealin' cars. Messin' around. Don't you think I know that's a bunch of bull! Mac! We're doing the best we can! You really believe that? You really think this is the best we can be? I want to be better. I want to do better. No, you're right. I got to do it for my moms. For Skinny. For Skinny. Will you do me a favor? Yeah. Will you come somewhere with me? Good show tonight. Hey Miles. What's up? Have you heard from Tyler at all? Nah, Nah. How's Nora? She's good. That's cool. What was that all about? Thanks I guess. Hey guys. - Hey, what's up. - Hey. Miles, you ready? Yeah, you know it. Great, see you there. Luce'. Have a good show tonight. You too. Welcome ladies and gentlemen to this very special evening. The fall senior showcase is always... a highlight at the Maryland School of the Arts. 10 minutes. That's 10 minutes everyone. You all right? Yeah. Give me some, come on. Hey yo', thanks man. Will you go. Nora! Tyler what are you doing here? Before you say anything... Look, I don't know where to start. I just... I'm sorry. Okay, I shouldn't have walked out on you like I did. Tyler this is not the time. Please just let me get this out. Look, I've made every wrong decision, I could have possibly made. Tyler, it doesn't matter anymore, I'm doing this without a partner. That's enough, go on and check your dancers. Tyler, I don't think you realize how important this is. No, I do realize how important this is. And that's exactly why I'm here. You said, if I want something, I got to fight for it. Right. Well that's what I'm doin', I'm here and I'm fightin' for somethin'... that's real for the first time in my life. I can't do this right now. This is everything that I've been working for. I know and I'm sorry... I just wanted you to be able to do this, the way you imagined it. That's it. I can't. It's too late. Okay. Good luck. Tyler! Do you remember the steps? Couldn't forget them even if I wanted to. Okay everyone. We're back to the old dance. With Tyler. Okay, let's go! This is the girl I was telling you about. Okay. Excuse me. Oh, sure. Bye... Bravo! That was all pretty good. Come on man, you've seen me dance before. Yeah, but not like that, I ain't never seen you do nothin' like that before. That's her right there. That's her? And over here... This is Nora Clark. Wow. You were wonderful. Oh thank you so much. I'd like to sit down with you and discuss the... possibility of joining our company. After graduation. I would love that. Yeah, me too. She's everything you said she'd be. Who's the male lead? This is Tyler Gage. He's a transfer. Oh my God... Wait, what? Don't forget to send your transcripts. Yes, ma'am. Very well done. We'll see you Monday. We'll see you on Monday... Congrats, man. Appreciate it man. I'll let you do your thing, meet you in the car. You should go... So you know what that means, right? No... What's that mean? You're going to have to get some tights. Done.
