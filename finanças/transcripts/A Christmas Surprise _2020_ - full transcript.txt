I told you that I was coming. Right, about 30 minutes ago. Well, I'm sorry, but the queen needs her time to prep, darling. Oh, I apologize, Your Majesty. You know what, I'm just so happy I get to spend a little bit of quality time with my BFF. Mm... Can you not call me that? It sounds, I don't know... Will you stop acting weird? Oh. Hey! -It's me and Brittney's song! -Ooh! ♪ It's gonna be a very merry... ♪ Don't you think Brit's getting a little too old for the annual Christmas performance? But the key word is annual. And, no, I don't. Ah! You know Brittany loves it just as much as I do. [chuckles] Hm. -Oh, boy, I know that look. -What look? [sighs] All I'm saying is just take it easy, okay? It's her last Christmas break before graduation, and I'm sure she wants to keep it simple. Oh, please, you're acting like I'm extra or something. [laughs] You? No. As your friend and accountant, just less is more. Mm, please, simple is my middle name. Well, you got the loudest basket in the whole place. Oh. Wait, wait, wait. Oh. Oh? Hey, little princess. Well, looks like somebody has the last B stockin', huh? And? Well, and my daughter's name is Brittney and I'm gonna need that stocking. Well, my name is Belinda, so not happening. Oh. She a B all right. -Tanya. -What? Oh. How about this. How about I pay you for it? -What do you say? -How much? -Um... -Fifty. -Fifty what? Fifty cents? -Fifty dollars. I don't think Santa would approve of you trying to seal my stocking. You know what? Now, girl. You're gonna give me that stocking. Give me the stocking. [mumbles] Man, she's strong. Give me the stocking, little g... Oh! Oh, oh, God. -Help! This woman attacked me! -Oh, girl, please, get up. Oh. Hi. What... Belinda, what... I-I'm sorry, what's your name, ma'am? -Aisha. Come on. -Hi, Aisha. -Belinda, come on, get up. -Look, I'm-I'm sorry, okay? -Why are you on the floor? -I told you. She pushed me and took away my stocking. Okay, I know what this probably looks like, okay? But I most certainly did not push her and did not take away your stocking! She was on the floor! Okay, look, all right. The last thing that they need to see us up in here doing is fighting and acting a fool. All right? I didn't take away your stocking. -Why you gonna tell a tale? -We're not gonna be up in here. Fighting. I'm just gonna let your ass out. -Over a stocking? -It's not over a stocking! My baby was on the floor! She slipped and fell on the floor. You know you fell on the floor, I'mma tell Santa about you. -'Cause you being naughty and... -Stop talking to my daughter. I'm sorry, okay? But does she even spell her name with a B? What? You know how creative you guys are. How do you spell your name, sweetheart? Who is you guys? What are you talking about? Okay, l-l-ladies, ladies, ladies, it's Christmas. Huh. Let's all just take a deep breath. -[Tanya] Ow! -[instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] What the hell is he doing here? Well, look it here, it's the ghost of Christmas past. Your mother. Craig, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be at the airport. -Uh, what happened to your eye? -Uh, allergies. Okay, and never mind all of that. Why aren't you at the airport getting Brittney? Tanya, this is, uh, Vicky. I mean, Victoria. -Victoria's my, uh... -Nurse? Assistant? Secretary? This is my girlfriend. -Oh? -It's nice to meet you. I've heard so many pleasant things about you. Oh, I'm sure. -Does he need help? -You know what? That's a really good question. Why don't you go help him? That's good. -Please don't, don't do this. -Don't, don't, don't do what? Look, I am not thinking about honey boo-boo. Okay, I'm more concerned about why are not at the airport pickin' up our daughter. I'm headed to the airport now, but I'm on my way out. -What do you mean? -I have to go away for work. Hey. -Yes, I'm her. -Excuse me? Victoria, the lingerie model. You were about to ask me if I was. I have no idea what you're talking about, but I'm Jaylin. Oh, Jaylin! Craig told me Bianca speaks so highly of you. [chuckles] Her name is Brittney. But thanks. That's what I meant. [Tanya] Away to work? What do... Do they always argue like that? -You mean booty calls? -[indistinct chatter] I'm just gonna have to go and pick her up. That's already been handled, I called a ride from the airport. Oh, that is so tacky. Does she even know that you're not gonna be here for Christmas? I was hoping that you would be able to tell her. Why would I wanna tell her that you're gonna ruin Christmas yet again? [car door shuts] Daddy! Oh! There's our baby! -[Tanya squeals] -Baby! [laughter] -Look at you. Look at you. -The best for last. Oh, but of course. All right, thighs. Mom, what happened to your eye? Uh.. Allergies. Oh, God, and it's contagious, too, so be careful. All right. Well, you know, I was gonna say how tacky to call me a ride from the airport, but now I get it. You two wanted to surprise me and meet me together. -How sweet! -[laughter] Ooh, Jaylin got a girl, and she's a baddie. -She's your daddy. -What? -Not exactly. Victoria. -Yeah. Baby girl, this is my girlfriend Victoria. -Your who? -Hi, Bian... Brittney. I've heard so much about you. -I'm sure. -[laughter] Hey there, almost college grad. -Uh-oh. -Hi, Jaylin. Yeah. What happened to your eye? Your mother, we was... Gave him the same allergy that I had. I'm telling you, baby, it's contagious. -Okay? So... -Okay. Uh, Craig, why don't you tell her about the good news? -Oh, baby girl... -Actually, you guys. I have some news to share myself. -You're pregnant? -No. -Oh, thank God. -But I am in love. -Ah! -[laughter] Ooh. Ooh. Okay. Oh, okay, tell us all about him. -Well, his name's Amiri. -Oh, Amiri. Mm. I like that. -Sounds distinguished. -Yeah. When do we get a chance to meet him? -Oh, he'll be here tomorrow. -Tomorrow? I know I should have told you sooner. You think? Craig, don't you have something to say? Yeah, your mother's right. We definitely need to meet the guy... Making your daughter happy. [Craig chuckles] [chuckles] Why are you smiling like a Cheshire cat? I'm so happy that everybody's gonna be able to meet him this weekend. Baby girl, about that, I, uh... You didn't tell her, Pookie? "Pookie?" Tell me what? Uh, Jaylin, why don't we take those bags on the inside, okay? You gettin' a little comfortable with them, okay? -Oh, uh, Merry Christmas, Craig. -Merry Christmas. -You guys, let's take a selfie. -[Craig] Yeah. -Come on, come close, please. -Why? [camera clicks] [blows whistle] [laughs] Rise and shine, baby! It's eight o'clock in the morning, and the day is almost over, honey. Come on, baby, we got a lot of work to do. Brittney! [blows whistle] Brittney. Come on, baby, we got a lot of stuff to do. Mommy's got a full agenda. [sighs] Brittney... Oh, come on, baby, look. I know how disappointed you are that your father's not gonna be here for the holiday, okay? And trust me. He would've been here if he didn't have to work. I mean, I know takin' a work trip during Christmas is not only tacky and messy, but I think it's disrespectful and it has no... Okay, okay, mom. All right, but, look, the silver lining is guess what, you got me! And do you know what I was thinking? I was thinking maybe we could put on some matching PJs, watch some Christmas movies, huh? We could get some of that old-fashioned spiked eggnog. Huh, and we could put in some real quality time before Amiri gets here. -Okay. -Britty-Brat. -What time is he comin'? -[doorbell rings] [gasping] -What? -He's here. What? Brittney? [scoffs] You did not tell me he was coming this early. Baby! Oh, my God! I know I wasn't due to get in until tonight, but I just missed my baby so much! Come, come, come, come! [door shuts] -[Tanya clears throat] -Oh. I'm sorry, mom. We just... We missed each other. You know how that is. I mean, used to. I mean, mom, this is Amiri. Mom? Mom? What? Amiri, this is my mother Tanya Hamilton. My champion, my she-ro, owner of her own successful hair-care line. But most importantly, my best friend. Uh, I thought I was your best friend. -Miri! -[chuckles] I apologize. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Hamilton. Amiri, I am her best friend. [laughs] I told you. I told you she's silly. [laughs] You almost had me there, Ms. H. I, you... Why don't I show you to your room? Come. Who the hell is Ms. H? Prince wannabe. [sighs] Oh, shoot Oh, there you are. I thought you got lost showing Amiri to his room. Stop, I was just giving him a tour. Hm. -You okay? -Who, me? Oh, pssh, I'm good. I mean, it's not like some random stranger just got sprung on me during the only time I get to spend with my little princess, but... Oh, wait, that did happen. I know. I, I could have done a better job with that. Yeah, you think? But just, please play nice. Look, he really is a great guy. Okay, Brittney, I'm sure he is a great guy, but I don't know anything about him, okay, and I don't know what he does, I don't know what his parents do. Did you meet him at school, you meet him in class? I, I just... Girl, I am clueless. I know, I know. Look, just please... give him a chance, mommy. I hate when you make that face. -Please? -Okay. -One chance. One. -[squeals] That's it. Okay? And make sure he tries some of my product for that hair. No, seriously, he needs some shape. Wow! This spread is amazing. Ms. H, did you cook all this? It's Ms. Hamilton. And, no, actually it was catered. Well, 'cause it seems like so much. -Were you expecting company? -Nope. No company at all. It's our tradition. We have a mommy-daughter feast the morning after I come home from school. -Yup, mommy-daughter. -Oh... Well, I hope me being here isn't too much. No, not at all. Right, mom? Oh. No, well, of course not. Please. There's plenty of food. Eat. Psst. Okay. Oh. That's some college appetite. [laughs] Yeah, minus the college. I'm sorry, excuse me? Oh, yeah, I'm-I'm not in college. Oh, so you finished early? No. [Brittney] Mom... Mommy... -Mama? -What? Amiri is an amazing artist. Aww, thanks, babe. Amiri, look, I'm sorry. I do not want to come across as rude, but, honey, I have heard literally nothing about you. Totally understand. And I must take the blame. Look, I told Brittney that I didn't want her to give you my resume, you know? I just wanted it to be organic. Wanted you to feel my energy. Oh, feel your energy? Ooh, that's artsy. Well, can you feel my mine? You know, these strawberries are really good. -[door shuts] -Ah, Jaylin! Yeah. What's the emergency? I got here as soon as I could. You are right on time to meet Brittney's new boyfriend Amiri. He's an artist. -That's the emergency? -Yes. Ah, nice to meet you, Amiri. So what type of art do you do? Well, definitely not the kind that gets a grade. -What's that? -She's trying to make sure... You're aware that Amiri's not in college. Oh. I see. Well, college isn't for everybody. -Uh, exactly. -[Tanya] Look, I'm sorry. I gotta disagree, okay? Education is the key to opportunity. Agreed. But who says that school is the only pathway to wisdom? You know, I am so sorry, Lenny Kravitz, okay, forgive me, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. I'm only a successful entrepreneur that has a masters in both business and marketing. -So unnecessary. -Oh, impressive. I know it is. These warm exchanges are really great, but, Tanya, don't you have a party to plan for? -Oh, shoot! -Mom, that's tonight? Yes, Brittney, it is every year the day after you come home from school regardless as to what the weather brings in. -Should I come? -You really don't have to. -Mom! -[Tanya] What? Okay, look, of course he can come, okay? Well, maybe he should show his art. -I don't know. -Sounds like a good idea. -I don't know. -Yeah, no. I mean, we could we be sitting in front of the next Rembrandt. -Hm. -Hm? Hm? Okay, fine. Fine. You know what, I will make sure that he has a spot so he can display his little art. Thank you, Ms. H, but again, that... It's Hamilton. Mrs. Hamilton. Like the musical. Thank you. -Tanya, can I speak with you? -Speak. In the kitchen. [sighs] You need to apologize. I think you insulted him. Insulted him? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, he insulted me. Look, I just offered that nobody a chance to be somebody in front of everybody! And you're supposed to be on my side. Sides? Why are we taking sides? Oh, we started taking sides when I realized my daughter is dating a loser. That's a bit harsh, don't you think? Oh, he hasn't seen harsh. You know, I really think you should share your work. What? Uh, What? Uh, it's clear your mom doesn't respect me. But that's why you should show her your work 'cause then she'll see. No, I'm not trying to buy her approval. Approval? Approval for what? Hm? Approval for what, Brit-Brat? Huh, Boo-Boo? what does Amiri need my approval for? -Well, I... -No, no, I can, I can speak. No, you... I don't think that's a good idea. Well, I'm sorry, but will someone please enlighten me before I politely lose it? [sighs] Okay, so the approval... Well, you know, it's Christmas and he needs to show his work because, uh, we're gonna be leaving for... Brittney, honey, I'm sorry, you're not making any sense. Okay, w-what are you talking about leave? Spit it out. Well, Amiri has an upcoming art exhibit in Basel, Switzerland over New Year's Eve. His promo tour starts for the Art Basel this summer. Wow. I heard of that, Basel in Basel. -Why do you have to leave? -I want to support him. And we wanna celebrate, um, our honeymoon. [scoffs] What, a honeymoon to dating? No, not dating. Okay, wait, now you two aren't married, are you? No, we're not married. Okay, well, will somebody please tell me what's going on? We're-we're getting married on Christmas. Wait, you didn't, you didn't know any of this? I thought she just didn't know that we had to leave. [Tanya chuckles] [Tanya] Hm.. [Tanya laughing] You know what? You got me. Y'all got me! [laughs] Okay, who was recording this? Was it you, Jaylin? Is this one of your online jokey-jokes? -I don't think they're joking. -Oh, they joking, all right. You best be joking, Brittney. We're not joking. You jokin'. You mean to tell me that you're gonna marry a guy that I haven't even met, doesn't go to college and I'm assuming that you haven't met his family either? Not today, Satan. Not today. Look, mom, please, can you just for a second... -Y'all not getting married. -But we are. "But we are." You know what, that's cute. That's real cute. Okay, so who's gonna plan this Christmas wedding? In a week at that! Huh? Well, that's the good news, mom. You know, we've been planning for a couple of months. So it's about done for the most part. You've been planning this for the last couple of months? Yeah. How thoughtful of you. Mom... [Brittney] Mom... You know, I just, I really thought you'd be relieved. Look, it's just, I know you've been really busy with work, and I didn't want you distracted. Look, I just have a few loose ends. Oh, you got that right. No, but we just want something small, a little party, nothing too extravagant. Yeah, nothing too, too extravagant. Oh, please! The Hamiltons don't do anything small. Everything we do is a production. And that's the problem. A smaller wedding actually doesn't sound bad. Jaylin, no, thank you. No, thank you. Brittney, let me talk to you for a minute. Real talk. Are you pregnant? -Mom! -Okay then, follow-up question. -Are you on drugs? -Mom! Really? That is not too far-fetched to ask, okay? Who's gonna pay for this wedding? Dad is. So your father knows? Yeah. Wow. -Wow! -But, mom... He hasn't met Amiri yet, you'll be the first! Oh, okay, but your father gave you a blessing for a guy that he hasn't even met yet and you couldn't even introduce me? Ma, it's not like that. It's just... You know, I knew you would react like this, and dad is just... -What? -He's just easier. Easier to what, Brittney? -Easier to talk to. -Oh. I'm glad you found someone that you can confide in. -Mom? -Brittney, this is a lot. That's all I'm gonna say right now, okay? Let me go talk to your mother. Oh! Mm-mm! A Christmas wedding! Mm-mm! Not on my watch, not today. -I hear you. -Mm-mm! Do you know what, Jaylin? I really don't think you heard me. I really don't think you did, okay? My daughter is about to throw her life away and marry some tagger that she barely even knows! -Well, he did get into Basel. -Basel-schmasel, razzle-dazzle. I don't give a damn about his art. Do you honestly feel like telling her no is gonna stop her? She's just as stubborn as you. How can you be so calm about this? We don't know that guy. We don't know where he comes from. He might even be from the ghetto. [scoffs] You're from the ghetto. I was. I was from the ghetto. Ain't about where you come from, about where you at. You trying to control things is only gonna have her run further into his arms. Hm. So what's your plan? There is no plan. -Hey. Hey! -What? I know it's tough, but you've got to trust the woman you raised. And if there is a plan, that's it. Support her. Try to get to know your possible future son-in-law and help plan this wedding. [whispers] Okay. [exhales] -Okay! -Okay. All right. You're a good friend. Your BFF, right? Buddy. -God, thank you! -You got it. [sighs] Brittney. My pretty, pretty Brit-Brat. Aww! Oh, my little princess, my baby. [chuckles] And Walter. Hm... How you doin'? [laughing] [indistinct chatter] Amiri is definitely a hit. Did you see his work? He's pretty talented. Uh, whatever, I guess. But I still got my eye on him, I don't like those artsy types. -How's that now? -Freaky deebs. I'm telling you, they're like playboys. He's gonna slip up and I'mma be right there and I'mma catch him. be like, "Bam!" -Bam, huh? -Yes, bam. -[chuckles] -Bam! Oh, Jesus! [laughing] I'm sorry. What, it's too easy. You know what, you've been doing a whole lot of surprising around here lately. On that note, I'mma go refill my drink. [Tanya] Mm-hmm. [Jaylin] Sorry. -I really am sorry, mom. -Mm. You didn't deserve that. It wasn't cool. No, not at all. Do you love him? -I do. [chuckles] -[sighs] Look, mom, I know I'm asking for a lot, but... just look over there. When he looks at me, he makes me feel like I'm the only woman in the room. That's 'cause you are savage! -[laughs] -What? Mom... No, I'm just sayin', Brittney, I wanted us to spend more time together, that's all. I know, mom, and I promise, we're gonna get our time. Mm-hmm, and I cannot believe you planned an entire wedding without me. Do you know how long I've been planning that day for you? I know, I know, but I just wanted to keep things simple. You know? But we still need a cake and we need a DJ. Oh, wow, hooray, I get to be on cake duty and I get to find the next DJ Nice. Wow! Mom, we could use your pastry chef. -Chef, um... -Chef Mindy? -Yes! Chef Mindy! -Oh! What if we got 12 doves and released them at midnight? -Twelve o'clock midnight? -Mom, small. -Remember? -Okay. But I am happy that we have you onboard. Oh, well, I'm getting there. Well, how about we get you there on the stage where we can do our little number? -And show the peeps. -What we got. Yeah! You got it? Oh, let's do it, girl! Let's do it! Let's do it! Let's do it! Let's do it! [Tanya vocalizing] Ooh, whoa. Merry Christmas, everybody!

All right, give it up for my daughter Brittney all the way from college! [crowd cheering] [Amiri] Ah! -Hey! -[Brittney] Hey, mom. -[laughs] -Wanna do some shots with us? Ooh, no. I have not done shots since college. But, well, maybe that's not even a college thing anymore, right, Amiri? That performance you guys put on earlier was really beautiful. Oh, thank you! Not you. I'm talking to them. Weren't you the woman they tried to take the mic from? [mumbles] Ooh, they smell old. Like, old old. Is that... -Amiri, I'll be right back. -Oh! Hey! -Is that her ex? -Mm-hmm. Oh, you dirty little... I thought you didn't like surprises and now you're doing the same thing. Look, I said I don't like receiving surprises. Now, giving them, that's a whole other thing. [indistinct chatter] -Something looks different. -Hm. It's way too many patterns for one person. Walt, this is my fiance Amiri. Amiri, this is Walt. Hey, it's nice to meet you, bro. Hey. Hey, Ms. Hamilton. -Walter. -[laughter] You know, Walt, this is so random seeing you here. Well, yes and no. -Oops. Oh. -[Brittney] I see. [laughs] You know, mom, I actually ran into Walt a little bit ago and we reconnected. I'm so happy that you're living in your truth now. His truth? It was such a heavy weight off my shoulders, but Britt is the best. I mean, I thought it would be awkward, the whole my-ex-is-now-gay thing. [laughter] Thank you, sister. You know, Walt is actually a big-time DJ now. -Oh, stop. But go on. -[laughter] Oh, wow, that's so cool, man. Wait, wait, would you be interested in DJ'ing our wedding? -I would love to. -[Brittney] It's a good idea. -Yeah. -Yo, Ms. H, did you plan this? Well, that's my mom, you know, she always has a little trick up her sleeve. -[laughs] -Look at 'em. [laughter] Yeah, you like 'em. -Mm. -Uh, oh, okay. -Damn, Walter. -Slow down. Oh! Hey, sleepyhead. You know, the caterers did an amazing job. You can't even tell we had a party here last night. Oh, the caterers might have done a great job with cleanin' up, but my poor head, Whoo, it is definitely telling me we had a party, I guess I had one too many of those Santa shots. They got me feeling like a ho-ho-ho! [Tanya laughing] -Uh, you're okay, baby? -Oh, yeah. -Where's Amiri? -Um, I don't know. -He left earlier this morning. -Wait, you didn't call him? No, you know, he rarely has his phone on. [squeals] I'm sorry, timeout. [laughs] Okay, wait, wait, wait, let me see what you're sayin', that there are some times that he doesn't have his phone. So that means you can't always get in contact with him? Mom, he's an artist. Sometimes he has to fall off the grid. -It's not a big deal. -Okay. Okay. I'm just saying, it's just kinda hard to trust a man when he gives you a reason not to really. You just gotta trust your gut. [grunts] Not this gut. [laughter] [Tanya] But if you say so, baby. -Ah. -Ah, good morning, ladies. I hope you're hungry. I brought some treats. Oh, Ms. Hamilton, I know we started off a tad bit rocky, but I wanted to thank you for your hospitality. Aw! See, mom, isn't he sweet? Mm. He's so sweet, my tooth hurts. [chuckles] Wow! Oh, well, you know, your grandmother always said "Be leery of men that are full of compliments and gifts. It usually means that they're full of other stuff." Well, you know, mema also said to be slow to judge and quick to observe. -Mm. -Sounds like a wise woman. -I can't wait to meet her. -Oh. You'll get to meet her. On this weekend, she'll be at the wedding. I know she can't wait to meet you. Okay, look, I'm sorry, Brittney, wait a minute. So mema knows, your father knows. What, who else knows, the mailman? -[whispers] Not right now. -Okay, I'm sorry. Amiri. What do your parents think about this engagement? Um, well, my mom knows. And my father passed away when I was younger. [Tanya] Oh. I'm sorry, okay? But what does your mother think about this entanglement? [car honking] Um, she's here early. -Oh, I forgot she was comin'. -[Tanya] Who's she? -Who? -My mother. Ah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You ain't told me nothing about his mother. I know, I forgot. Come on. Come on. Brittney! The house is a mess! [dramatic music] Brittney! Are you serious? This is not only the second unexpected guest, but unexpected surprise. What is going on with you? I'm sorry, I was just so nervous about how to tell you about the wedding, I completely forgot she was coming. But, look, I invited her to stay with us because I figured you two would hit it off and we could all bond. Okay, you know what, you invited her, so you're gonna host her. Get your own agenda. -Hi, mom. -Mwah. Hello, baby. Wilson, can you GPS the nearest Four Seasons? That won't be necessary, Wilson, you can just grab our bags from the trunk, please. Mom? -What? -Please don't start. I just wasn't sure this cottage had enough room for me. There's more than enough room, mom. I guess. I just don't see why you made such a fuss of me staying here with your future in-laws, and for a whole week, it's absurd. Our future in-laws, mom. I just thought we could speed up the process of getting to know one another by spending some extended time. Hm. Okay. -What's the deal with the queen? -I don't know. I haven't heard much about her, just that she's travels a lot. -Oh. For work? -Oh, no, she doesn't work. I think she has her own private jet or something. Oh, come on, ma, let's go meet her. A jet? -Hi. -And this is Brittney. Hi, it's so nice to meet you. Mom, this is Ms. Hamilton. Oh, uh, you can call me Tanya. Nice to meet you, Tanya. I'm Ms. Lawrence. [Amiri] Mom. Demetria is fine, I guess. [sighs] Cute place. Is it a rental? [scoffs] -Uh... -Okay, okay, okay. [Tanya sighs] So, uh, although we weren't expecting company, which seems to be the recurring theme around here, um, I think you'll be very comfortable in our maid's quarters. -Mom. -Well... Brittney, she prefers to call it the West Wing. [Tanya and Demetria chuckling] Well, Tanya, your home, well, it's, it's very cute. -Thank you. -Yes, it's very pleasant. Is it, um, like a fixer-upper? Mom, you remember I told you that Ms. Hamilton owns her own company. A very successful line of hair-care products. [Demetria] Mm-hmm. Good for you. This administration is definitely working with a lot minorities, get their businesses started. You know what, why don't I show you to your chamber? Walk this way. Oh. Here's my wall of fame. Just a few of my awards. You know, God gives the real reward. -Oh. I'm allergic to dust. -Mom. What? Uh, listen, I don't meant to be mean. I'm just a big germaphobe. -Likewise. -Mom, look at the time. We've to go to our cake tasting. Ooh, yes! Well, it takes about a year to get an appointment with Pastry Chef Mindy, but thank goodness she's a dear friend of mine. Oh? Well, I've never heard of her. But then again, I'm not big on sweets. You gotta stay fit, you know? Come on, mom. [Tanya grunts] You know, mom, I'm really excited to be doing this. Ooh, me too, ooh, you saw those two cakes that were right in the front, they look delicious! They look so dry to me. About as dry as their closure. -Excuse me? -You heard me. You know, mom is actually moving her business out into Asia, so she's been studying the culture for the past few years. -Oh, nice. -Thank you. Where did you say Chef Mindy is based out of in Korea? The south side. [chuckles] -[gasps] Ah! Chef Mindy! -Hi! Oh, thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedule to squeeze us in, you remember my beautiful daughter Brittney, the bride-to-be. Congratulations! And my, look how much you've grown! Thank you. I'm so excited to see you. It's great to see you, too. Tanya, it's so good to see you, and anything for an old friend. Chef Mi Young? Chef Mindy. I am so sorry. You know, you can't bring everybody with you and you... Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm impressed. Not too many Americans know me by that name. I know, when she just kept going on and on about this Chef Mindy, I had no idea she was talking about the world-renowned pastry chef Chef Mi Young! [speaking in foreign language] Yeah. Me. Excuse me. Okay. Could you, uh, please go get the cake? Oh, yes, of course. Here they are. It's right here. -[Mindy] Here they are. -[Brittney gasps] Oh, look at the... -They're gorgeous! -Oh! I really like the one on the left. -Hmph. -Hmph. -Hmph, what? -Nothing. You... I really didn't mean anything by it, honestly. Everybody has their own preferences. I prefer the one on the right, it's simple and rich, confident in who it is. It doesn't need to scream "Here I am." [Mindy] Your taste is exceptional. Most Westerners, when they come in, their eyes go to the bigger, more decorative cake. But, Brittney, you can't go wrong with either one. Well, which one do you choose, honey? -I think... -Choose wisely. Brittney, look, simple. You like simple, you said you do. Honey, nothing simple about you, baby. Look at your hair and all that product, honey. Come on, choose the one that fits you. Your mother did that. Simple, rich and confident. Mm! Shiny, classic and everything. [indistinct chatter] -Yeah. -I-I don't know. You don't have to decide right now. Oh, why don't I give you some time? And I'll be back. -[Tanya] Mm-hmm. -Mm-hmm. Oh. [speaking in foreign language] You know what, you put a sock in it! [Demetria screams] -Why did you do that? -What? Please! -[coughs] It's peanuts! -Are you okay? You know, luckily, the medic said that her throat should clear up soon and maybe she'll even have her voice by morning. Okay, look, how was I supposed to know that she was allergic to nuts? Okay, you weren't, but how about it's not cool to force-feed a person? Ah. That's fair. -Oh, you wanna watch a movie? -Are you serious right now? You know, Ms. Lawrence's throat is swollen like a tennis ball, you don't even like Amiri, and you're laying here like everything is fine. Okay, Brittney, it is not that bad, okay? Shh, bring it down. Now, I admit things haven't been the smoothest. You know, mom, I appreciate the fact that you're encouraged. I really do. You know, I'm gonna go upstairs and get some rest. [scoffs] Brittney! Mom, i-it's really not that bad. L-look, I know we hit a rough patch, but I'm sure tomorrow will be better. Mm-hmm? So you just gonna up and leave? [mumbling] "I'm leaving to keep the peace. If I stay any longer, I'm going to snatch off her wig." Okay, well, that-that's a bit much. [mumbling] "She has no soul." Now you're just being mean. I understand, she can be a bit of a handful, but it's not like you've been a bucket of sunshine either. Mm-hmm? [mumbling] [Demetria mumbling] "She's a cold, lonely old woman." Really, mom? Look, in all fairness to Ms. Hamilton, she's the only one who didn't even know about the engagement. So I think we need to be a bit more understanding of her. [mumbling] And you know what? On second thought, if that's the kind of energy you're gonna bring in this house, then maybe you should leave. It's best you take it with you. [mumbling] [door shuts] [mumbling] [sighs] [sighs] -Hey, dad. -Hey, princess, how's it going? It's all right. I thought you were on a work trip. I am, these clients just like to play while they work. Trust me, I'm working, princess. I guess. So mom got to meet Amiri's mother. -[Craig] Ooh. How was that? -How do you think? One thing about your mother, you know what you're gonna get. -Yeah, a lot. -She's definitely a lot. But so is finding out your daughter is getting married in a week to a person you've never met. Yup. You can close your mouth now. I miss you, dad. I miss you, too, princess. -[Victoria] Pookie! -But, hey, uh... I know, I know. You have to go. I'll, uh, I'll get with you later. ♪ Sometimes I feel ♪ ♪ Like a marvelous child ♪ ♪ Sometimes I feel like a marvelous... ♪ [Brittney] Mom. What are you goin' through? -A lot. -[laughs] Well, you're off to a late start today. -What's up with the agenda? -I decided to scrap it. I created a new one for the wedding. -Really? -Mm-hmm. Well, can I see it? [Brittney chuckles] Okay. This is nice. But remember, all we need is the cake since you, you know, took care of the DJ. -[laughing] -Ha-ha-ha. Okay, it's just a rough draft. I mean, we could change it if you want to. Well, well, no, you know, actually, this part I really like. You know, we definitely have to get you a dress for the big day. Mm-hmm. The only thing that's missing... What? Spend time with Brittney. [laughs] I'm thinking spa day? Massages, aromatherapy, the works! -Oh! -And, my treat. Oh! Brittney, I would love that, baby. Mwah! -Hey, mom. -Hey. How's your throat? I see the swelling's went down. It's better, thank you. Well, good. I brought you some of grandpa's famous Earl Grey tea. Oh. Aren't you sweet? -They had some here? -No, it's mine. I keep some with me wherever I go. Remember you giving me some of this tea and telling me that it would bring me comfort if ever I was scared or stressed? Is that what you call yourself doing for me now? -Only if it's working. -Well, it is. -Mom... -[sighs] No words needed. I've been an ass. I will try harder to get along with the Beverly Hillbillies. I'm sorry. -I am work in progress here. -Yeah. Aw, baby. Mm. Ah, ah. Wow. Oh. Oh, God, I so needed this. -No, we needed this. -Mm-hmm. Okay. I'm all ears. -What? -You know what. Sell me on him, Brittney. Mom, it's just... He's so inspirational. You know, he's, he's loving, he's kind, he's creative. Okay, okay, so he's a Renaissance man. All right, I get it. How well do you know him, Brittney? Well, about as well as the person you've been getting to know for over a year. What? You've been dating him for a year and I'm just now finding out about him, Brittney? [sighs] You know, you were always good at keeping secrets from me. I'm sorry, mom, it just didn't make any sense to tell you if you two couldn't meet each other. I know if I told you about Amiri, you'd be on the first plane to USC. Yes, but... Brittney... you wanna marry this guy? Come on, honey, you're so young. You only have one semester left. I know, mom, but I just wanna create a new Christmas memory. Okay. I really regret that we divorced on Christmas. Okay, your father and I both do. But, honey, there was a lot going on. I don't blame you guys for that. I just think we all need a fresh Christmas start. Mm. You know what? I am in a place of Zen. So I'm going to mind my business for now. Well, hallelujah. You know, we should have started with the massage. -Exact.. Ooh. -Ooh. -Amiri! -Hey. Sorry. Um, I told the guy at the front that my fiancee and her beautiful mother were here and he told me to come in. I didn't mean to intrude. I just assumed you two would have been done by now. Amiri, you didn't get my text message? I sent you a message saying we extended another two hours. We were having a good time. M-my fault. I didn't check my phone. Mm. Well, you know what, I'mma let you two lovebirds go ahead and catch up. I've spent enough time with my baby. And I'm sure you're going through withdrawal. Yeah. All right. Sorry. I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to interrupt. [sighs] It's okay, we were just having a good time, but I think she's finally in a better place. -What about your mom? -Uh, yeah, she's coming around. She's in a good place, too. Now if we can just get them both in a good place together. Right, but how? Hm... Surprise! I figured we could spend the evening drinking and enjoying Amiri's passion of painting. Mm. Cool. Hey, Jaylin, I'm so happy you could make it. -Oh, thanks for inviting. -[Brittney] Of course. Uh, we haven't been properly introduced. Oh, I'm sorry. This is my mother. Mrs. Demetria Lawrence. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Lawrence. Miss. And you can call me Demetria. All right, you smile any harder, your lips gonna crack. Hello, everyone, welcome to Painting With A Twist, where we like to sip and paint. My name is Ted, and I will be your host for the evening. Has anyone been here before? -Definitely not. -Definitely not. Oh, great! -Well, follow me. -Okay. So as I previously stated, here at Painting With A Twist, you sip, you paint. Hey! Oh, my God, we get it, Pee-wee Herman. Uh, because it's that time of year, uh, the object that we will be painting is... -Drum roll please... -[drum roll] A Christmas tree! Go, get creative. You can do some more festive lights, some candy canes, ornaments... -Mm-hmm. We get it, Urkel. -Oh. [imitates Urkel] Did you do that? And the name's Ted, and I can come by and assist. Oh, we won't need that. My son is a famous painter. -Mom, it's-it's okay. -Well, bravo for you. -Okay, Ted, don't get cute. -But I wasn't trying... Well, you did. That's my son. Close your mouth! I don't think this is a good idea. I think... -We might be losing them. -No, no, let 'em be. Oddly enough, they seem to get along when they're both being mean, specifically to this white dude, but it's, it's fine. -[Tanya laughing] Oh, God. -[indistinct chatter] -How about some wine for you? -Oh. Thank you, Jaylin. And some wine for you. -Well, thank you. -Don't worry. Ooh. Is this for communion? Oh, God, girl, I was thinking the same damn thing. Okay, see, that's what we get at a paint and sip. Okay, you know they gonna be trying to give us a bottle of wine, too, for free. Uh, Ted! Can you give me some water, please? -I'm a little parched. -Sure thing. And we can do without the attitude, Ted. -[Tanya] Ugh. -Did you see that? Mm-hmm. Just like his tiny tie. Oh, God. You guys, leave that poor guy alone. You know what? Will you hush? Yes. Chillax, Jaylin. Let me see what you got going on over there. [gasps] Ooh, okay, okay. I see where your son gets his talent. Thank you, love. Wow! You know, I really like this, too. It's so simple, and just, it's classy. Thank you. Well, it's simple and sweet just like you. No need to dress it up with unnecessary things, you know? You know, that's what I was telling mom about the wedding. I just wanna keep things simple, you know? I do, I do, but there's nothing more disheartening than an over-the-top, gaudy wedding. So self-serving. It's like, "Look at me, I'm important!" [Demetria] I mean, whose wedding is it anyway, right? -Right? -Right. [Tanya laughing] That's crazy. You know what? This is true. It is, it is. But I do have to say. You know, there's nothing wrong with a little decor. You know, just to add a little zest. Just a little bit. Just that much. You know what they say? You know, sometimes they say less is more! [Tanya gasps] Why, you little... You know what? Every Christmas tree needs a couple of balls dangling from it. You know what I mean, huh? Huh? Just like that. Just like that. No. No. No, you not. You know, maybe we do need a little zest. Whoa! There's a mustache to match your beard. Wax much? You know what? I will after this. -Ah! -Oh, oh... No, don't. No. That's definitely going to be extra. Thank you so much for giving me a ride home. I could not stand to ride home with that woman. You know, there's some clothes in the top drawer in the vanity in there. [Jaylin] Thank you. Are these it? Oh. That's it. Uh, you know, I, um, hope you don't feel uncomfortable wearing some of Craig's old stuff. No more uncomfortable than having paint in your underwear. Hm. Don't mention underwear. [laughs] That's a little different. [Tanya] All right. You're big. I mean, strong. Uh, bigger and stronger than Craig looked when he ever... Never mind. Um, Jaylin, look, I am so sorry, okay? I never meant to get paint all over you. That's the thing, Tanya, you keep plotting and scheming and end up hitting the wrong target. -What about her? -What about you, Tanya? She was having a moment with Brittney, and you couldn't handle it. [knocking on door] Hey, Brit. Goodnight, Tanya. Hey, princess. Okay, look, I know tonight was horrible, all right? But tomorrow's gonna be so much better. I promise, okay? And your wedding's gonna be amazing! That's actually what I came to talk to you about, mom. It seems like planning this wedding is driving you a little crazy. And I think you need to focus on just being my mom. So no planning with the cake and the decorations. I think I just... I wanna leave it up to Mrs. Lawrence. Should handle the logistics because she and I have similar tastes. Really? I see. I mean, mom, you still can plan. There's a few... It's fine. I get it. -Okay. -Okay, well, thanks, mom. [knocking on door] -Come in. -[door opens] [door shuts] -Hi. -Hi. -I'm sorry to interrupt. -No. No interruption at all. I was thinking about the plans that you had for the wedding, and I was wondering if you would wanna help. [laughs] Darling, I thought you would never ask. I would love to! And I need to apologize. I misjudged you when I first met you. And, honestly, you're the daughter I never had. Thank you. -Oh, you're so sweet. -Oh. No, like, I really appreciate that. So I was thinking that tomorrow we could go out and get some wedding stuff. -Oh. No, no, no. -Is it really... No. We're not going anywhere. See, I don't go to places. Places come to me. 1920. Oh. Oh, there. [instrumental music] -Let it rest. -Hm? Another one. [disc scratching] [mouthing] Thank you. [music continues] Oh, you didn't have to. These are beautiful. Thank you so much. Oh, honey. Anything for you, Brit-Brit. -Oh. -I wanted you to have them. -So... -Thank you. Maybe I'll wear 'em on wedding day. Brit-Brit? Really? Ain't your daughter. Nobody won't take my baby away from me. "Brit-Brit, this is just for you and your wedding. Really, I could get you another gift better than your mama." Of course. With my luck, I Google the nearest bar and happen to run into the woman that despises me. Oh, you know what, you can save all that drama for your mama, all right? Go on, sit down. Oh, and for the record... -I don't despise you. -Mm. I'm just not sure if I like you or not yet. -Well, that-that's honest. -That's it? -That's all you got? -What do you mean? It's like, every time I shoot you down, you just come back with that smile. [chuckles] Really? I need you to go low. Every time I, uh... Go low with me. Come on. Meet me halfway there. Give me something. Come on. -Sorry. -Oh. Believe it or not, I actually like you. -Ooh. -Hm. -You know what, Amiri? -Hm? I owe you an apology. -An apology? -Mm-hmm. Wow. Okay, I-I gotta hear this. Hey, can I get a whiskey ginger? Ooh. You know what? Make that two. Oh, put it on me. Hm. So, confession session. I know I'm a lot, okay? But... truth of the matter is, I really think you're talented. And I know I give you a lot of stuff, but, uh, it's not about you. So I know your mama gotta be proud of everything you're doing. [scoffs] Yeah. Uh, my mom was raised as royalty. I'm talking servants, guards, you name it. So impressing her isn't an easy task. -Wow! -Yeah. Servants? Yeah. Thank you. Her parents were part of one of the wealthiest tribes in South Africa, so... That's why she had that feather. Yeah. The feather, the robe, all. Yeah. No. Hm. Don't remind me. The thought of her doing anything for herself was actually frowned upon. And when she met my father, he was already a world-renowned orthopedic surgeon. -Wow. -Yeah. So the plan was for me to follow in his footsteps. Mm-hmm. But, you know, it just wasn't me. You know, I had, I had to find my own path. I fell in love with the paint brush. Hm. And she was devastated when I decided not to go to medical school. -Mm. -She even tried to pay me. -She did? -Mm-hmm. -How much? -A lot. -[laughs] A lot, like what? -Hm. A lot like Money Mayweather like... -What? -A lot. Wow. Damn. Well, you know what, young man? That is commendable. I like that. I guess. I think after my dad was gone, the only thing she was holding on to was me following his legacy. Wow. So, yeah, on-on the surface, she loves to talk about her son, the artist. But I know she would prefer her son, the doctor. I'm telling you, that is sad. Man, that's like your mama can't see your greatness. You know, just like Brittney can't see how much I care. Can you believe she's planned a whole wedding without me? I mean, a whole wedding. Not a reception, okay? Not a sit-down dinner. I mean, a damn wedding. I'm sorry. She... That was my fault, too. [scoffs] As a single mother who had to raise her child... it's hard. And I mean, we just trying. You know, that's all we doing. We just trying. It's all trial and error, and error and trial and... [inhales] You know, if we could just help our children not to suffer any heartache, if we could spare them that, and just give 'em the option that they can go down another road in a different path that's just a little higher than what we had to go down... -You know what, Ms. Hamilton? -What? You're not that bad. -That's all you got? -You're pretty good. -Okay. Thank you. -You're pretty good. And you know what? You go on call me Ms. H. Ms. H? I can call you Ms. H now? -Holler. -Okay. -Okay. -No, these ain't bad. Hm. [instrumental music] [line ringing] ♪ Down sip it up ♪ ♪ Comin' up comin' up comin' up ♪ -All right. -[indistinct chatter] What we ain't gonna do. ♪ Comin' up comin' up comin' up ♪ -All right. -Yeah! [instrumental music] [clock ticking] Mm. Not bad for a cold, ugly, old lonely woman, huh? -What is... Oh, no way. Oh. -What's that? -Oh. Oh! I heard you and your mama that night. -Let's go play it. -No. I wouldn't.. I would never, no, those comments came courtesy of my mother. Oh, your mother. Oh, Lord, I wish Brittney could see this. She would not believe this. She would never believe this. -Wait! -[Tanya] Oh, my God. -Oh, I can't breathe. -Oh! -Oh, I can't breathe. -The... -The-the rehearsal dinner. -What dinner? The rehearsal dinner for our wedding. Oh, God! [indistinct chatter] -Oh, my God. -Go grab my bag, baby. Oh, my feet won't move. Wait, I gotta pee. [door opens] -Thanks. -Have you seen Tanya? She's talking to the driver. [footsteps approaching] Babe, I got some good news. Where have you been? I've been calling you for over an hour. I know, I just saw my phone. But here's the thing. Guess what. Oh, okay, maybe not. Me and your mom are best friends. -Amiri, please. -Again with the missed calls. Are you being serious right now? Did you not hear what I just said? [Brittney] Are you being serious right now? I'm supposed to believe you were with my mother? You know, I can't get in touch with you and you can't see why that's a problem. Babe, please. Just hear me out. How am I supposed to trust a man that gives me reason not to? Isn't that what you said, mom? What, cat's got your tongue? Why don't you tell your little drinking buddy what you said? Okay, princess, look, that was way before I actually had a chance to even get to know him. Okay, so now you've had a few drinks, you can actually... -See the good in people? -Brit-Brit. Don't talk to your mother like that. You know what, don't you tell my daughter how she should speak. [Demetria] Like you know how to speak to her all of a sudden. Okay, you know what, you need to worry about getting to know your own child. What's that supposed to mean? You so worried about your damn legacy, you won't give him a chance to create his. Amiri, is that how you feel? [sighs] I see. You did that. I'm sorry, Brittney. -I'm sorry. -No. You got what you wanted, right? And I've always respected that about you. Your by-any-means-necessary approach to get what you want. I just didn't know that it applied to me. -Baby. -I'm not your baby. Wow. I'm sorry. You're not gonna go after your mother? I'm trying to be here for you right now. Right now was when I was calling you earlier. God, it's like you are so freaking impulsive. You know, it seems romantic and exciting, but really, it's inconsiderate. You'd have some accountability, Amiri. I love that you're spontaneous, that you're not married to time... but there really has to be something that you care about. Maybe we are rushing into things. [instrumental music] [music continues] -Hey. -Hey. Look, if you're here to make up, you better grab an apron. Oh, but I forgot. You probably have a wait staff, right? [laughs] I do. But I also watch a lot of Chef Mi Young. [laughs] You know, I don't know what I hate more. The fact that you speak fluent Korean or the fact that Chef Mi Young likes you more than she likes me. -Wow, I'm impressed. -Mm. I know sharing that had to hurt. Ugh. More than you know. Well, it's only fair that I return the favor. Uh, you don't have to. -Yes, you do. -I figured. Okay. Here goes. [clears throat] I am... somewhat intimidated by you. Oh... Really? Okay, you know what, you are pouring it on way too thick now. No, I'm serious. Amiri is so impressed that you own your own business. He's always like, "She's a self-starter. Nobody ever gave her anything." I can't compete with that. That's not true. Amiri adores you. He does. Okay, I just think that you need to care a little bit more about what he does. -I do care. -Oh. Pfft. I don't. But I'm just so... I mean, I do. I do. -I just, I just don't get it. -Really? He's not asking you to get it. All he wants you to do is just accept the path that he's chosen. That's it. Okay. My turn. Brittney doesn't like me either, does she? Nah, not really. -Oh. Damn. -No. -Girl, we gotta fix this. Yeah. -Pretty much. [knocking on door] Where's your drinking buddy? -I've been avoiding her all day. -Cute. [sighs] She's downstairs in the kitchen with my mother. I actually think I overheard them making up. Are we ready for this? I mean, really ready? Yeah. Yeah, I am. Are you? Yeah. But you have to answer your phone. -Oh, done. -No, I'm serious. You know, sometimes you just have to be present and have a plan. Am I turning into my mother? Like, planning a wedding is hard. I wasn't prepared to do this by myself. Well, I thought that's what you wanted to do. It's bigger than the wedding, Amiri. I'm talking about our future. You know, I love that you march to the beat of your own drum, but you have to make sure that I'm there marching with you. You know, this whole time I've been trying not to be my mother and be this carefree spirit, but it's not me. But that's what I love about our love. Our differences give us the balance we need to grow into whatever we want. That was, that was really beautiful. But you sound like a fortune cookie. [laughing] I'm just playing. -I love you. -I love you, too. -So we're gonna do it. -Hell, yeah, we're gonna do it. [laughs] [instrumental music] [knocking on door] -Hey there. -Hey. Brittney, I feel like an old fool. -No. -I should've never... Mom, I'm really sorry. -You're sorry? -Yeah. You know, I've just been so worried about you over-crowding me that I guess I never stopped to ask myself why that is. Planning a wedding is hard. And it's dumb to do it by myself, especially when I have the greatest coach in my corner rooting for me to win. Wow. Brittney... I'm speechless. I am. [sighs] Thank you. Mom, there's so much that I love about you. You're a smart, intelligent, nurturing woman. [sighs] No, mom, I really, I love our talks. And I love the way that you love on me. It's just.. Mom, you have to trust me to grow up a little bit. Hey. I get it. My butterfly needs to spread her wings. -Just a little bit. -All right. Now, if I do that, you promise me that you will... [inhales] you gotta communicate with me more. -Agreed. -Okay? And consult with me when you make these big decisions. Okay. Agreed. And promise me I will always be your girl BFF. I wouldn't have it any other way. Okay! -I love you. -Oh. I love you, baby. Oh. My little princess getting married.

You read that on the Internet, didn't you? I did. But I'm serious. You don't have to live for me and your father. You've earned your right to walk into your own legacy. And your father, he would be so proud of you. -[chuckles] -I love you, mom. I love you, too, honey. I love you. [instrumental music] -Oh. -Oh. Mom, you're gonna mess up your makeup. Oh. You're gonna make me mess up mine. Well... I just can't believe this is happening, baby. Oh, you look so beautiful. Thank you. [sighs] You remind me so much of me on my day, it's... kinda scary. Oh.

So, Amiri. [sighs] I can still remember when you were a little boy and you would get so frustrated with puzzles, that you would just force the pieces together. Well, Brittney, you are the perfect piece to his puzzle. He no longer has to force things to fit. -To the bride and groom. -To the bride and groom. [applauding] Yeah. Yes! Lovely. I didn't know we were doing shout-outs. Hey-hey! [laughs] You know, Brittney, you are the apple of my eye, my cherry pumpkin piece of pie. And, uh, Amiri, well, I now have the pleasure of watching you be the fruit of her loom. 'Cause he's a groom. And here's to your storybook of a journey. -To the bride and groom! -[all] To the bride and groom! -[indistinct chatter] -Thank you. [Demetria] Yup. [Tanya] What are you doing? You can sit, you can sit down. Sit down right there. -You can sit... -I know where my seat is. Well, she's so funny. Oh, yeah, sit down. Okay, so I wanna add a quote to that storybook from my good friend, Toni Morrison. -May she rest... -Personal, personal space. -Yeah. Personal friend. Yeah. -Oh, good. Yeah. Yes. You know, God rest her soul. "Love is divine only, difficult always. And if you believe it is easy, you are a fool. If you think it is natural, you are blind." [laughs] Amiri, Brittney... uh, you know, I-I think you should and-and you would turn each page of your storybook with intention. -[indistinct chatter] -[applauding] Yes. All right. Yes. Ooh, you got it bad. -Excuse me, lady. -Oh. All right. Okay, now you can find your seat and you can sit in it. [laughing] Go, girl. All right. You know what, speaking of Toni, Toni Morrison, you know, right before she passed, we were actually supposed to go horseback riding. -Mm. -Yes. -She hated horses. -No. But she loved to ride 'em. Okay. [laughs] But before she passed, she said... Oh, I got this. Thank you. [laughs] She said, "The function of freedom is to free someone else." If you free your mind, the rest will follow. -All right, mom. -Yes, okay. Don't be color-blind. -You talk about being black... -Let me... Can I... Uh, no, you can't, you can't. No, you can't. Uh, if you ladies would please go back to your seats? [indistinct chatter] -Um, your seats. -Okay. Ms. Hamilton, mom? -Love you. -Mm-hmm. Mm... Love you, baby. Everybody, please give it up for my mom and my beautiful mother-in-law. Thank you. I would like to share a few words about my wife, the bride at this wedding, if that's okay. [laughs] Brittney... I could study under Basquiat, Picasso and Van Gogh and still never create a work of art as beautiful as you. [woman] Oh... You're my sun, my moon. And I love you like the fat kid loves cake. [applauding] [instrumental music] You wanna go out there? Uh, maybe later. Looks like mema got the spotlight now. I don't wanna steal her shine. [laughing] [sighs] -You okay? -Yeah. I just cannot believe they actually got married. I mean, after all the mess I put them through. I'm a lot, huh? -[chuckles] Yeah, you are. -Oh. Okay, so then why do you put up with me? -That is a good question. -Mm. I don't know, maybe it's the passion you put in your family, you know? The drive you putting in your work. Or maybe it's those damn lips I've been waiting to kiss ever since you got back on the market. Oh, look at that. Well, it's about time! Ah. What are you talking about? I'm just saying. Whatever. We are grown, Mrs. Lawrence. Mm-hmm. Well, just don't hit me with any surprises. Okay, just don't hit me with that fan. -We good. -Love y'all. I love you, babe. Mm... Come here.
