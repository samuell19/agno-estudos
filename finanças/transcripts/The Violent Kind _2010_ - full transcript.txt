Ugh. Off, come on. Come here. Put your hand there. Gimme that. Now you shouId reaIIy consider changing up your IifestyIe, buddy. Yeah, I don't think change is much of an option for me, Shade. I worry about you, Cody. What are you doing? Sh. You know you can tell a lot about a person just by reading their paIm. What does mine say? I have no idea. Haven't gotten that far in the book yet. Gimme my hand back. Tomboy wannabe palm reader who looks like a cover model. God just insists on giving me lunatics for family members, doesn't he? Look good? How do I look? Amazing, go get 'em. I'll see you at the party tonight? Yeah. I love you, cuz! Its not getting enough gas! We gotta hit the road "Code," takes three hours almost to get up to the farmhouse. I know how long it takes.

Just leave the bike here, we'll fix it tomorrow. Okay, stuck with you fucking clowns. Come on man, Iighten up, it's your mom's 50th birthday. Whew! All right. Let's party. Man, it's a damn shame no one really comes up here anymore. Place just sits up here empty. We had some good times, didn't we, brother? Good times. Yeah. Elroy, back in the day, this place was the spot, man. I'm telling you, gambling, drugs, back door business, no cops. Had my first hooker up here. I was 12. See these boys? Hey, boys! Oh!

Damn shame no one comes around here anymore. Back in the day this used to be the spot. Really? Mm. That's odd. I can't recall seeing you here before. Huh? You know, since my dad's an original member and all. Don't try so hard, rookie. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Your Uncle Linus isn't feeling real well so I gotta get him home. Love you, baby. And be good. Fuck you man! Hey! Hey! Not in my house, hey! You don't remember me, do you Cody? Megan. Michelle's little sister. Megan. How long has it been? Um, I think I was 17 the last time I saw you. Just before I left for school. How'd that work out for you? I graduated last semester. Right. Anyway, I heard it was your mom's birthday so I tagged along with my sister. Sorry it didn't work out between you guys. Seven years is a Iong time. And weII, now she's running around with that douche bag. Well. I just wanted to say hi. Um, I should probably go find Michelle before she leaves me stranded once again. Megan. Couple years back when I got locked up, I knew it was you that sent me those letters. Thanks for the beer. It was good to see you, Cody. better take off man, it's getting Iate. Hey. Let's get outta here. Yeah? Yo, man, everybody's Ieaving. You want me to drive Mama? Don't be stupid. Yoo hoo! Hey, have you guys seen my sister? Oh, my God, honey, it is an angry coIIege person. Are you kidding me? Did she leave? Maybe she went on a beer run. Maybe she did, except that there's nothing around here for miIes. Do you guys mind if I catch a ride with you? Sure thing honey, but you better get comfortabIe 'cause we ain't leaving till the morning. Are you serious? Do I look serious? I'm sorry, baby, but everyone's already left. Sorry, baby. WeII, who's that? You better go find out if you want a ride.. Hello? Anyone out there? Crazy mother fucker, your old man. Sick one. Yeah. Here. What were we, like 5 and 10? Something like that. Born into The Crew. Bred to be fearless. AII we've ever known. AII we've ever known. Look, I know this is going to sound like some club house bullshit but the old timers, they want you to do a chump border run. Prove your loyalty to the Crew. Is that right? Border runs are for rookies and prospects. I was born in. I've given my Iife to The Crew. You fucked up bad, man. You exposed us. You know we're not in a position to mess with the damn Russians or the Gangbangers. And if I refuse? What do you want me to say, Cody? HeIp me. Help me! Wake up. PIease, wake up, MicheIIe. Just wake up now. You're going to be okay. No, we can't just Ieave them. You know how far the hospital is from here. Where were you at? Oh, shit. What the f-- He's dead. What the fuck? What the shit man? She didn't hit nothing. Well it had to be something. How the fuck did this happen? Maybe it was a bear? Okay, don't taIk, okay? Not anymore, you aren't allowed to talk anymore. Understand me? Come on. Come on! Fuck! Oh. This shit's not working, man. Put it in neutral, Elroy. Oh honey, what on earth are you doing? Come on! It's fucking dead! The fuck do you mean my truck is dead? That thing was running perfectly, Cody, I swear to God. Hold on, hold on. How is she? Could be bleeding internally. She needs help, Cody. I'm working on that. What do you mean? We got a serious problem. Truck's not working. Everything's lined up, it's just, just dead. See what I'm saying? This can't be happening, Q. It's way too far to walk back to town. We put somebody out on the road, try to flag down a car. At 2 in the morning? We'd have better luck just walking the 30 miles, man. Plus, we don't know what's out there. What about the old hermit up the way? Will you watch my sister for me? I'm gonna go try my cell phone again. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem. I'm sorry! Is this okay? Fuck. You're, you're okay with that? Yeah? Oh! Ugh. Get the fuck off of her! Shade, get her out of here. Shade, get something to tie her down with! Fuck you! Mother fuckers! Stop it! You're hurting her! Come on, gimme. Hurry up Q, I don't know how much Ionger I can hoId her. Holy fuck, she's strong. All right. Stop it! What the fuck are you doing? Just don't stand there, help him! It's okay. Okay? Okay. Elroy, hang in there, man, we're going to get you some help okay, I promise. EIroy's not gonna make it another hour. Fuck! I'm going to kill that fucking bitch! You can't lose it, man. I need you here with me. Don't fucking lose it? Don't fucking lose it? That cunt! She tried to kill Elroy. See his fucking face? AII we can do now is get them out of here and get heIp. All right, what are you thinking? The oId hermit Iives a coupIe miIes up the road. I'm gonna hike it up there. Doesn't have a phone, but maybe in the last six months he's gotten a car. It's worth a fucking shot. AII right, I'II stay on the truck. Hey brother. Guess I forget you used to love that girl. Wilmer? Hey, old man, are you in there? WiImer? Is that you? Wilmer? Is that you? No! You can't make me! You'II have to find someone eIse! Michelle? Michelle? Shade? Why-- Why am I tied up? You tried to eat Elroy's face, honey. What? Where's Dave at? It's okay. It's okay. I've read about this. Okay? What? Do you think he had something to do with Michelle and Dave? What did you get yourseIf into, oId man? There's something inside you? What is it? Please, why are you doing this to me? What do you want froMus? Are you looking for someone? What? What do you want? Please Shade, I don't... Something's... Something's wrong! Michelle, come back to me! Come on Michelle. Something's wrong with me! Q! Q! Q! Q! Q! Q! What happened? She got out. She's in there. Get back. I'm gonna end this now. Ah! No, baby. No. No. It's okay. Shit, I don't like this, Q. Where the fuck is she? Where are you at, you bloody bitch? Q. Q? The fuck happened? Michelle! What did you do to my sister? What did I do? Bitch was in there crawling on the ceiling. Open the door. I want to see her. Be my guest. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Jesus. How did she? I think with those. Oh, fuck me! Oh MicheIIe, we gotta cIean you up. Yeah. I wouldn't do that. She gets a little touchy. Oh, my God. What the hell happened? There's something inside her. Something really fucking evil. Time to abandon ship, brother. What are you talking about, Q? We've done all we can. If we Ieave, they both die. Can you live with that? I'm not leaving my sister. We all know, that thing in there, is not your sister. Shade's my only priority now. Shade is my blood. You're my best friend. But we are not leaving people here. Do you understand me? Cody's right, Q. We gotta stay and help them. I'm taking Shade, and uh, we're leaving now. Come on. I never took you for a coward, Q. Ugh! Was I the one, was I the one who bitched out to the East Bay posse? Admit it! Admit it! You fucked up last month 'cause you're the coward! You're the coward! Cody, don't. He'll kill you. Come on! Come on. Ugh! Q! Don't! You had enough? You had enough? What's it gonna be? You know that Cody once toId me that he only trusted one person in this world. I guess he was wrong. Fine. You let him take care of you then. What the hell? Fuck! Fuck! Do you know why I wrote you all those letters? 'Cause Michelle wouldn't? The park fair. You took me there when I was 13. Remember? You used to come to town every summer. I was begging Michelle to take me for weeks, and all of a sudden you showed up and you picked me up in that ugly primered car of yours. And no one could believe that Cody McKay picked me up and took me to the fair. I was the coolest girl in school for weeks. All because of a simple gesture. I'm aware of all the things you've done. All the violence, but between your uncle and my dad, and losing your father, you never really had a chance and that's not fair. What is that? Elroy! Shit! You shouId not be up. Hey, do you have a beer? I don't think you want a beer right now. No no no, a beer sounds amazing right now. Sure, Elroy. Yeah, oh, yeah. What are you doing out here man? What the fuck are you doing out here, Dave? I don't know, man. but it's been a really weird night. Me and, uh, Michelle. We got hella high, bro. What's the matter, Q? Shit man, you were dead a few hours ago, you asshole. What are we doing after this? Sh. You hear that? EIroy, are you all right? Why? Hey, what's that noise? I don't hear anything. It sounds pretty. Like music. Holy shit! Hell, yeah! Guys, the fucking thing is working! What did you do? I don't know, but who cares? God! Hey, Shade. I'm totaIIy feeIing better now. Are you aII right? Elroy, we gotta get you into the truck, okay? That sound, its Iike that song, what the hell is that song? Thank you. For what? You saw me different. Cody. It's gone dead. Ugh! Whoo! Come on big feIIa! Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Loverboy is awake! Hey, loverboy. Oh! You Iooking for this? All this sweet puss loverboy, and you keep it to your self? Ah. What do you want? Want? We just heard there's a wild party here tonight? And we weren't invited, now is that true? Huh? Who are you? Do you have any idea whose house you just set foot in? All right, all right. All right. Before we all get into a hissy fit and start raising a ruckus, you're right! We should all go round the room and learn each other's names. Proper like. Me first, I'm Vernon. This handsome gentleman over here with the switchblade, that's Jazz. I'm shy. Ba-dat-dat-dat-da-dat!! Greetings and salutations. And that other gentleman over there with the earphones, that's, Murderball! MurderbaII, MurderbaII, MurderbaII. He's a little on the quiet side. The two fine young specimens in the back hanging out, that's Trixie and Pussywagon. Hi, loverboy. Oh, they like you. We're just a friendIy bunch, Iooking for a good time. The violent kind. So, now, loverboy, what's your name? Ew. What's you name. Hm? Cody. Cody. Now how 'bout the girls? What's their names? Megan. Shade. Megan and Shade. Now those are pretty names. You see Megan and Shade over there, they were scratching up oI' MurderbaII so we had to wrap 'eMup! MurderbaII just Iooooves his pIastic. Is it time yet, please? No, no Jazz it's not time yet. Have some patience! The show hasn't even begun! Now, it's been reaI nice meeting aII of you. But, this isn't all of you now is it? Hm? I'll give you one more chance, round up all your friends, and get the fuck out of here. Wow, you said that with such conviction. So hero-Iike. I count three of you, but I feel like somebody's missing. Of the female persuasion. There's no one else. Now, lying is a weakness Cody. And you ain't weak! You're a strong boy, I can see it in ya. What do you want froMus? We're here for the girI, Ioverboy, try and keep up. You're not touching either of them. I don't think you're in the position to negotiate, and besides, we're not here for Megan and Shade. We're looking for the other one. Don't you fucking touch my sister! Now there is some truth! Megan, you gotta stay quiet. Sh. Baby, we're not gonna touch her. We didn't come here for your sister. We came here for what's inside of her. Michelle doesn't mean harm to anyone. Michelle. Michelle! Another pretty name. GirIs! Put another record on! This one's a real drag. Whoo! Time for some fun. Some fun and games! Whoo! Nothing better than fun and games! Except for a good ol' fashioned drag race! Ya'll like to dance, right? Hm. Yeah, get in here Murderball. Whoo! Whoo! FeeIing good! Yeah! Whoo hoo hoo! Whoo! Lemonade and dancing, I Iove this country! It's enough! I don't think it is enough. It's reaI simpIe, just teII us where she is. Now's the real fun and games, finally! You let them go and I won't hurt her. Her? Go ahead, see if I care I said Iet them go, now! Okay Cody, we will. Ah! I'm digging your style bamalam but you are wearing on me. Tell me where Michelle is. She's not here, I swear to God! Don't swear, I don't like swearing. Is that aII you got, Ioverboy? Whoo! Whoo! Leave him alone! Whoo! Stop! Whoo hoo hoo! I love this! I'm coming! HeII, Iadies, put on some fighting music! You just earned yourself another chance. A chance to kill me, if you can. Whoo hoo hoo! Cody! Kick it up a notch, Pussywagon! Yeah! Hey, you ever see Jimmy Dean in "Rebel"? Hm? Jimmy Dean and this tough guy from another gang get into a knife fight at the Griffith Observatory in L.A., It's a terrific fiIm, Cody, you gotta see it. Okay, come on, now. You're the tough guy and I'm good oI' James Dean, the hero. AII right. CircIe me and attack. Whoo! Attack me! Yeah! You got it. You got it. Okay, now, call me chicken. Oh! No! Don't swing at me yet. Call me chicken! You're a fucking chicken! You shouldn't have called me that! Ugh. You get it, you get it. AII right now, Jimmy Dean swings again. Whoo! Hey. Now, come on. Come on. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He's pretty good, huh, Jazz? Whoo hoo! Oh! I thought you'd seen the film, Cody. No sticking, just a little jabbing, that's all! Fuck! Stop! I don't want no trouble, okay? Oh! Oh. Shade, Megan. That's not how the movie goes, Cody. Now that was a nice try, but I'm getting a little bored with all this. Maybe our little surprise will help you remember where Michelle is, huh? Hey. Come on Katmandu. The show ain't even over yet. You're fucking with the wrong people! No, you are. You have no idea what's coming, Shade. Hm. Ah. PIease, pIease, just Iet us go, Michelle has nothing to do with you. Untrue! We had an arrangement with the oId man down the road but he didn't honor that arrangement. And your sister, well your sister was just at the wrong place at the right time. You're crazy. You're crazy! Man! Crazy! Women, more music, and something upbeat. This pIace is becoming reaI square. Ugh! Please, God. Please, just let us... Just let us go. You think God only listens to you? So seIfish, Megan. We got our gods too, you know, just as real. And you know what, Iet me Iet you inon something eIse. If there is a God, guess what else exists. Leave her aIone. You don't scare us with your stupid "Manson" shit. Shade. Sh. They aren't who they say. What? Huh? I can hear you, pretty girl. We're not... We're not what? You don't know what we are? No. No. You don't. We have been waiting for a long time. Dormant for more than sixty years. And we are not trying to scare anyone, Shade. It's just, what's coming, [chuckIing and panting] something is gonna happen that can't be stopped! And you get to witness the birth firsthand. I'm so excited! Hm. Fuck you, you delusional dick, fuck! Such ugly, ugly words from a pretty, pretty girl. You are never gonna find a man with a mouth Iike that, are you, Shade? Or will ya? Speak of the devil! Whoo! No! No! No! I'm gonna fucking kill you, you fucking dick-head! No! I'II kiII you, you fucking bastard! Someone needs to shut her trap, she is wearing on me! Fuck you! Oh, thank you, Trixie. Who is this? Who could it be? Oh. Oh, oh, oh! Ain't so pretty anymore, is he? We don't know where she is, goddamn it! Ugh. Yeah! Fuck hiMup, Vernon! Whoo! What? What? Stop! Stop the music ladies. What did you just say, Jazz? I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, Vernon. I didn't mean to cuss, man. You're sorry? Well, sorry ain't good enough, Jazz. That's five in the swear jar, now. Five! Now! Five in the swear jar. We gotta take responsibilities for our actions, don't we? Yes, sir. Yes, we cannot be like them. No, sir. No. It's gonna be okay, Jazz. You couId put an end to aII this Cody, aII you gotta do is teII us where she is. Get out of here! Whoo! Fuck you, I'm gonna kiII you! Jazz, shut her down. Hey, Cody, you ever wonder what's wrong with the worId? You ever wonder how to change it? Huh? You're fucking dead. Cody! I Iove this cat! Is it finally time, Vernon? It is, Jazz. It is. Whoo hoo! Murderball! Where has my head been? I compIeteIy forgot, we put her in the bathtub! I am such a dummy. Now I know what you're thinking, Vernon, you're a fibber! You knew this whoIe time she was here. GuiIty as charged. But we needed a safe pIace for MicheIIe to incubate, so we reaIIy did have some time to kiII. Whoo hoo hoo whooo! MicheIIe. What the fuck? This is how the worId's gonna end, Cody. It's okay, she just doesn't recognize her own yet. What did you do to my sister? Your sister, weII, she's not really your sister anymore now, is she? No. You see, Michelle is the host, to what you might call our queen. But that titIe doesn't reaIIy give it justice, now does it, Jazz? No. Line 'eMup in the front row. I don't want anybody to miss this. I am so excited for you to see this, especiaIIy you, Cody. It is gonna to be soIid, goId, fantastic. Meg. We gotta figure out a way to get you out of here. I'm not gonna leave you. Look at me, I'm done. Hey! Shut your mouth. You wouIdn't want me to do something awfuI. Screw you. You just might. Jazz, get over here. Yeah. Keep an eye on her, would ya? Help us. I can teII, you're different from everyone eIse. Just let us go. Please, just let us go. She's something, ain't she? AII right, boys. Grab our friends and bring 'em over here. It's time to bee-bop-a-loobop. WeII, we want to thank you aII for everything. It has been a wiId ride. Cody, Megan, Quentin, ya'II sure do know how to have a reaI sweII time. But, all good things must come to an end. Michelle. Oh, you really don't understand, do you? Huh? You gotta let her go. Michelle's gone, baby. But something brilliant is taking her place. You're not even human! You're a devil! A monster! Do you even know what is happening? Look around you at what is happening. Your stories of gods and monsters and devils and angels and, where do you think they come from? Huh? Huh? They come from the void. The bIackness, in-between the stars, Cody! Out there where time doesn't exist! From our kind. Oh, these fragile bodies you decided to dwell in. These small moments of emotion so strange. Oh. oh. This feeIing, is this love? You're gonna have to deal with some unpleasant shifts in time. But dig, you're gonna see the beauty of the moment. This is for Shade. Murderball, finish him off. You're not gonna see the grand finale? You're gonna have to kill me before I let you get to her. All this killing and violence, so unnecessary, but it seems to be the only thing you people respond to. I'm not gonna kill you, Cody. I came to see you off. You left without saying goodbye. We had a real good time with ya, didn't we? Lotta kicks, real fun. But, now, I got some more serious stuff I gotta take care of. You see, I Iike you, I do. In fact, I Iike you both, which is why I'm gonna Iet you go. Trust me, I'm not doing you a real favor. What's coming down now is a far worse fate. Something you can't imagine. You see, your kind is a dying breed. The human kind. All right then. I almost forgot. You can go ahead and take our wheels. We got no use for 'em anymore. Oh, pIus MurderbaII drank aII the gasoIine in your pickup truck. Good luck. You're gonna need it. It's gonna be a beautiful day! Stay with me. Don't fall a sleep. I'll get us some help. Stay awake. I'm awake. Megan. Thank you. For what? A simple gesture. You saw me different. Thank you. I'll be right back. Okay? Cody. It's gone dead!
