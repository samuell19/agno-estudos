All right, so, I just wanna say Thank you for all coming out today. I appreciate everyone spreading the good word. The inspiration being passed on. Obviously, everyone's seen the movie. We have any people here that have done a reboot? Fantastic. How 'bout this group over here? How many days are we talking? -Four days? -Six. -You're on day six? -Yep. -Day seven. -Day seven? -Fantastic. -Three days. You're on day three? How you feeling? -Good! -We don't need to call 911 for anyone on three days of this, right? All right, okay? We're all alive. We're hanging in there, right? America is in the midst of a brand-new juicing craze, and I've got the man who some say started it all. Two years ago, Joe Cross was, in his own words, fat, sick, and nearly dead. I've got a thing called chronic urticaria, which is like a chronic rash. -You got a what? -It's an illness. You know, like a disease. To save his life, he did something radical: he hit the road with a juicer in tow. Now, I've got my juicer... Now, this stuff will save your life. Cheers. Good health. Drinking only fresh juice for 60 days. That decision transformed his health. So anyone that done the reboot in the past. Anyone done more than 20 days? Oh, wow. So how long did you go for? -21. -Oh, really? Good. Lucky I chose 20 rather than 30? -And... -30. 30 days. Congratulations. Fantastic. And how did you feel? Tell me how you felt after 21 days? I felt great... I think the biggest difference was I was immediately able to go into a plant-based diet. I had no cravings. It was very easy to eat healthy. -Yeah. -So I figured out... Okay, so the good news is that... I've been out on the road now with the movie. This message of, like, drinking and eating more fruits and vegetables, It seems to be catching on. And so I'm just lucky enough to be the person who can share my experience, and then you can go on and share yours, and that's how you can pay me back. Little shots here. Should be enough for everybody. She really loves drinking green... She likes the juice? That's great. I love the sunnies. And I think this is how we make a big difference in the world, one person, one juice at a time. -Cheers. -Cheers! I'm gonna be round My vegetables I'm gonna Chow down my vegetables I love you most of all My favorite vegetable If you brought a big brown Bag of them home I'd jump up and down And hope you'd toss me a carrot I'm gonna keep well My vegetables Cart off And sell my vegetables I love you Most of all My favorite vegetable Chomp, chomp Chomp, chomp Do-do-do Do-do-do Bop bop bop bop Do-do-do, do-do-do I know that You'll feel better When you send us In your letter And tell us The name of your Your favorite vegetable Well, I'm back on Manly Beach. And it's been five years since we wrapped up "Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead," and at the time, I'd lost 82 pounds, I'd got off all medication, and I was feeling fantastic. Well, I've learned a lot these last five years. And one of the big things I've learned is, yeah, it was hard to drop the weight, but, boy, is it tough keeping it off. So... I'm back to go on a journey to find out how you can stay healthy in predominately an unhealthy world. Excuse me, folks, do you have five minutes to talk to us? We're making a documentary film. -For what? -About eating healthy. What do you think of the American diet? It's failing. Are most Ozzies healthy, or unhealthy? -No. No, unhealthy. -No, no. You think that most people are healthy over here? -No, not at all. -Really? Americans eat for comfort. It's like so easy, too. You just drive up to a drive-thru window. It's so convenient. What do you call healthy food? Healthy food is fruits, nuts, grains, anything that is fresh. Vegetables, home-cooked meals. Stay away from the fast food. Good old grilled cheese. -Always a favorite. -Right. Pretty much anything with cheese on it, I'll eat it. -Anything with cheese? -Seriously. -So you're a big cheese man. -Oh, yeah. Can you say that again, "What are vegetables?" They're disgusting and nasty. -Vegetables. -Yes. I don't eat 'em. One person I know who loves her veggies is Stacy Kennedy, the nutritionist I spoke to in my first movie. So when you first heard that I was gonna do a 60-day juice fast, what'd you think? I was a little shocked. I thought it was very extreme and definitely not something that we would promote to the general public. Yeah, believe me, it was extreme, and I'm... I'm not telling anyone to do it. But people are talking to me about what I'm doing, and, they're... They're asking me and coming to me for advice. And, really, I mean, I'm not an expert. I'm just a bloke who decided to make some changes, and document those changes... as an example or, you know, lesson to others. It may be a good lesson, maybe not a good lesson. I'm not sure. A 60-day juice fast sounds catchy and exciting, and that worked for you. But the focus is absolutely long term. We don't have a shortage of, you know, really, people losing weight so much in this country. There's a lot of diets and weight loss. Viewers are contacting us about something called the Paleo diet. The Mediterranean diet. Eating cotton balls to lose weight. You know, anyone can sort of go out and lose weight. But can you do it in a healthy way? Can you maintain that weight loss? And I think that that is where one of our biggest challenges is right now. He says he lost 37 pounds after eating just McDonald's for 90 days. A wake-up call about salt. We're eating far more salt than we should, and it's been linked to cardiovascular disease and stroke. A new study is shaking things up. It finds that eating less salt does not reduce the risk of having heart disease. And also, eggs. Turns out they may be healthier than they were before. It's no yoke. A new study suggesting eating eggs could be just as dangerous as smoking? Are you confused? I know I am. I reckon the first challenge is sorting through all this nutritional information that we're bombarded with every day. And Dr. Ornish, a clinical Professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, joins us... I've been a veteran of all these different diet debates, and diet wars over the years. And I got really tired of doing that after a while because there's so much heat and very little light. But I think that, with, you know, the exceptions of some extreme views, most people... There's a consensus about what constitutes an optimal way of eating. And it goes something like this. To the degree that you can eat more towards a plant-based diet... Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, soy products, in their natural, unrefined forms, that's optimal. Because it's not only low in the disease-causing substances, but it's also high in disease-preventing substances. There are literally hundreds of thousands of protective substances, and you find them mostly in fruits and vegetables and whole grains and legumes, and so on. But also, you want to try to avoid, too many refined carbs and sugar. Because when you go from, say, brown rice to white rice, or from whole wheat flour to white flour, you're removing the fiber and the bran, and that's what fills you up, the fiber and the bran, before you get too many calories. You can only eat so many apples. You'll get full before you get too many calories. But you can consume virtually unlimited amounts of sugar without getting full, because you've removed the fiber and the bran that fill you up. And the fiber and the bran also slow the absorption of the food from your gut into your blood. So if you just eat, like, the sugar and have a soft drink, your blood sugar spikes up, your pancreas makes insulin to bring your blood sugar back down, but over time, those repeated surges of insulin both predispose to chronic inflammation... They accelerate the conversion of calories into fat, and they have lots of other unhealthy effects. So what I tell people is just say, "Look, food isn't good are bad. Some foods are healthier for you than others, but it's not so much a moral choice. It's just, what do you want to do?" This is a part of the world I never used to spend a lot of time in. I used to look at this like, "Vegetables, fruit... Now, I kind of get, like, really excited when I come to a place that is, like, the produce section. All this color just bouncing out of this, you know. You've got your reds, your purples, your yellows, your oranges, and your greens. And that has been a really big change. When you think about it, there's really only three things we can eat. Plants, animals, and processed food. But, for most of our history, we've only had two of those. Plants... And animals. Processed foods have really only come along in the last 70 years. Think of hunger this way. When your cells need supplies, they pick up the phone and call room service. A message is sent to the brain saying, Joe, we're hungry! Send food and send it now. For most of our history, that meant either animals or plants. But mostly plants. These days, most of us have replaced those plants with the new kid on the block, processed food. As a result of this, our cells are missing out on vital nutrients, and they're not happy. They didn't get what they needed or ordered. So, you'll get hungry again, and quickly. Without these nutrients, those cells function less efficiently. So the problem isn't just what we're eating is making us sick... It's that we're not eating enough of what keeps us well. And that is why what you eat, combined with other lifestyle choices, plays such a huge role in determining your overall health. G'day, everybody. This is Joe here. I have some exciting news. We would love you to be in our next full-length feature film. How do you end up being in our film? Very simple: You make a video just like I'm doing right now. Hi. I'm Debbie. Hi, my name is Anupam, and we're coming to you from Dubai. Hello, my name is Elva, and I am Icelandic. Aloha, Joe and Reboot Team. Aloha from Hawaii. This is Manbotero. And I have Santa Bell here. My biggest challenges to eating healthy are when I leave my house. Time, you know. Scheduling. The fact that I travel a lot, so I'm on the road. Often, I'm in airports and... Hotels, and there... Most of the things that are convenient for you to grab on the fly are not healthy for you at all. So this is basically my life these days. In and out of airports. I'm actually at the airport now. About to fly to Vancouver. Arrived in Hamburg. I'm definitely coming back to Manila. Juicing is much more fun in the Philippines! Philippines, yeah! Where am I right now? Toronto, Ontario. Sometimes, I forget where I am. Okay, so we've reached Seoul, South Korea. Juicing up a storm in the south of France. So I'm standing on The Great Wall of China. Just want to show you what we've got here. Yes, we've got Oreo cookies. One of the problems, when you juice a lot, is you have to go here a lot. See that? So we are in, London. And, here's what I do. You're actually in my house. I now live most of my time in hotels, where there's a bed, there's my office over there. And, I also have my office here. That's kind of like my two offices. And that's what I do, and it's now... early evening, and we're about to head out and... hit the town. And a night on the town for me is talking about juice. Expecting a good turnout tonight. Maybe 100 people. See you, mate! How are you? You all right? Now, can I'm gonna ask the audience to stand up if you've done a reboot. Okay fantastic. Stay standing if you juiced for more than one day with just juice only. Keep your hands up if you juiced for more than three days. Three days or more... So more than ten days? How about more than 20 days? There's a few other things that have changed. Have to wear glasses now. Hair's got a lot grayer. But still, I feel great. I feel young, feel good, feel healthy, feel alive. And I work really hard, and I travel a lot. So, I'm hanging in there, and I'm doing it, and it's working. It's filling up nicely. As you can see... Yes? Can I just say that you have quite literally saved my life? Oh, thank you very much. That's very kind of you to say. I was diagnosed about three years ago with fibromyalgia, which is chronic tiredness, chronic pain all over my body. I've now been juicing at least twice a day since May, and I'm no longer on any medication. I don't walk with a stick anymore. I have no pain. And I feel absolutely amazing. I feel now I've got a life ahead of me instead of a death sentence. Congratulations. That's awesome. And it's thanks to you. Well, I look at it as it's down to you. So please don't think I get blase about hearing it. Every time I hear it, I am just touched beyond words. So, thank you for sharing with me... I've suffered from Crohn's disease since I was, like, 17 years old. I'm 32 now. After seeing Joe's movie last year, it inspired me to go buy a juicer, and within a few months after that, I was feeling better, and don't necessarily need my medication anymore. So the guy inspired me to change my life. It's amazing how many people come up to me at the end and just tell me how juicing and how eating more plant food has really changed and affected their lives, and I look at my Twitter feed or I look at Facebook... And it gives me the strength, gives me the power, gives me the will to keep going. And, I mean, they're my inspiration. Tell you what... A little tired. Look, it hasn't been easy. I'm first to admit that. But over the six years, I kind of started out, as we all know, around 310, 320 pounds. I got down to 220 pound. And right now I sit around 240. And my weight can change, and it does go up between 240 and 250, depending on my travel and stress levels. Like, I'm like anyone else, and when things are going well and are, you know, routine, I tend to eat really well. But when stress comes into my life and I'm feeling the pressure, then I tend to make poorer choices. I guess the big difference now is that if I do go off the rails, I can always do another reboot and get back on track. I'm not perfect, but I have done my best to try and amp up my fruit and vegetable intake. And, you know, it sits around 40%. And that's not 40% of, like, what's on the plate. That's 40% of the calories. It sort of means breakfast and lunch, to me, is very plant-based, and then dinnertime, I still put salads and veggies into it, but I might have processed or animal part then. You put lemon juice and olive oil. To me, what's more important and what's more valuable out of my journey is that I'm not sick anymore, and I don't take medication, and that my blood pressure and my cholesterol are all in the normal range, and that... That's what gets me excited. That was good. Thank you so much. I decided I needed to improve my diet because I was tired of feeling tired all the time. It really wasn't even my decision. I had three bulging discs, bilateral sciatica, and scoliosis, and I could barely walk. I would go to my doctors all the time, and I would say, "I'm broken." And they'd look at me, and I'd say, "No, something's wrong." I just thought, "It can't already be this bad. I'm only 31. It can't... My life can't be over." But my life felt over. I was extremely sick. I decided I needed to improve my diet for my own health, for my wife, to be around for her and for my kids, especially. I have this beautiful son, this beautiful new human, and I'm responsible for what goes into his body, and that has had a huge impact on me, just thinking about that. I realized that I needed to do something, and I fortunately realized that I needed to do something drastic. I needed to do something to change my life. Here was Joe, and he'd done it. And if he'd done it, I wanted to see how. Whenever I feel like I've gone off the rails, I generally turn to a reboot. What's a reboot? It's a set period of time whereby I'm only gonna consume fruits and vegetables. You can eat or juice them or do both. For me, as you know, I'm a juice-only kind of guy. Now, you may think this is a little strange, but our bodies are used to periods when food was scarce. Imagine you're back in time and you're on the savanna and there's not a lot of food around. The first few days, you're gonna be doing it tough. You're gonna be hungry and tired. You're gonna have pain and misery, and you're not gonna want to move. But hang in there. This is all part of survival. Your body is giving you hard-to-ignore signals which remind you to eat. Since you're not getting as many calories as you're used to, your body will start burning its energy reserves stored in the fat and muscle. It's different for everybody, but for me, I burned 70% of my energy from fat and 30% from muscle reserves. Now, around day three or four, you're body's gonna say... Hold on a second! I don't know how he's ignoring all these signals I was sending. You see, making you tired and angry wasn't working, so it's time for plan "B." Let's call this 'Survival Mode'. First, the body will switch off hunger because that hasn't been helping. Then you'll experience better focus, -Better hearing... -Huh? Better eyesight, a better sense of smell, and lots of energy... All the things you need to find food. Now that hunger is in the past, you'll feel a million bucks, and because you've been flooding your system with a broad set of micro nutrients your cells are gonna be doing cartwheels with joy. You've gone from the valley, where you were sick and tired, to the top of the mountain, where you feel amazing. And now it's time for your reboot to end and for you to come back to the present day. You've now reset your taste buds, and your body will crave healthier food. But this is only the beginning. The food choices you make after the reboot will determine if you stay on top of the mountain or start to slide down the hill. And the good news is there's always another reboot To get you back on top. What do you reckon the biggest challenge is for people today to be healthy? -What do you reckon it is? -Time. Woman problems... -Women problems. -All that good stuff. So, that's stress, right? -Yeah, a little bit, yeah. -That's stress. Yeah, when you have problems... Well, I'm the same, like, if I... If you've got problems, I run to sugar. What do you run to? I don't want to say. You're so busy, right? -Life just overtakes you. -Yeah, yeah. And food and consumption isn't something that's at top of the mind for people. I reckon, generally, we know what's good for us. What do you reckon you should be eating to be healthier? Probably fruits and vegetables. Vegetables. Fruits and vegetables. That's what I do. And we know what's bad for us. What would you say you eat the most of? -Bad food. -Bad food? -Bad food. -Bad food. -Why? -'Cause we love it. But it's not good for my health. Do you know that? Yes, I know it now. I've never met anyone that needed me to tell them that fruit and vegetables are good for you. So what are you eating there, mate? It's like... -Bread. -Sort of bread... You're just eating it and you don't know what it is? But we still continue to choose to eat things that aren't healthy. Well, American waistlines keep getting bigger. We all blame fast food, but what about cookbooks? Brian Wansink... I reached out to Brian Wansink, a former executive director of the USDA's Center for Nutritional Policy and Promotion and current professor at Cornell University. Brian has spent his entire career studying why you and I make the decisions we do when it comes to food choices. What we're gonna look at here is we're gonna look at this notion of licensing. Now, a lot of times when it comes to food, we look for excuses to give ourselves permission -to eat whatever we want to, okay? -Yeah. -And it's called licensing. -Right. Now, if this place is typical, we'll find about 20 things here that probably do that. All right, mate, after you. So what pops out to you here, Brian? What's the first thing you sort of noticed as we come into the cafe? The first thing I notice is that there's no way I'm gonna get a dessert with lunch. Okay, 'cause it's just not what I think about. But if I'm waiting three minutes in line, I'm gonna say no, no, no, no, no, no, no. But I'm gonna get here, and what's gonna happen is I'm gonna say, "You know, I was a good boy. I said no to every one of those first six items. I deserve something." And I'll say yes to that last item. Right. And this is licensing? -Yeah. -This is,"Because I said no, -I'm now giving myself a yes..." -Yes. "...when I get here to pick up the muffin -or the cookie." -Yeah, the brownie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause I've been a good boy. I've been a good boy, I've been a good boy. I've been a good boy. Now I need a treat. Yeah, yeah. I could see that. Let's take a look some... What else they do. We take a look here at the ice cream. You don't say, "Do I want ice cream, yes or no?" You kinda go, "Hey, does anything look good in there?" And I'm instantly making a decision. So there's five or six decisions -that could go on just here. -Oh, yeah, yeah. And it's not just which one we want, but it's, "Do I want it now? Am I gonna have a big dinner tonight?" Things like this. So when I come in here, and I see... I mean, we've got a whole wall here of the menu. So you told me that we make 200 decisions regarding food a day. Are these all the decisions that you're talking about? It's not just decisions as to whether we're gonna choose The California Dreamin' or The Sweet Onion Sandwich. It's all the decisions we're not even aware of. The thing about most of these 200 decisions is we're only aware that we make about 30 or 40 of them. And so there's all these things in our environment that can nudge or bump... 170 decisions to lead us to eat a little bit more, to choose a little worse than we otherwise would, 'cause we're not even aware we're making 'em. -Right. -And you think you deserve it, and you're gonna buy whatever you want. We should go, then. That's right. -Thank you. -Thank you very much. You know, I'm glad we got out of there without buying anything. Yeah, that wasn't too hard. But that was only our first stop, Brian. That's right. So what's our next stop? It says, what, "Healthy Mexican Restaurant?" Yeah, I think it's healthy if you eat half as much. Okay, well, let's go check it out. I think, Brian, that many people, what they're struggling with is that they feel that the odds are against them. They feel that there is... Just like it's just all too hard. When we talk about the odds being against them, how much of an effect does marketing have on people's food choices and what they eat? Anything that makes a food more attractive makes it more appealing to us. It's not just what a marketer does, it's what our grandmother does when she says, "Oh, here's grandmother's," you know, "special apple pie." Essentially, she's doing the same sort of marketing that the food companies are, in many ways. Where we can make the biggest difference quickest is essentially by not marketing food to ourselves. By not keeping the cereal box sitting right in the middle of the counter, where you can walk by and grab a handful every time we want to. By not having the least-healthy food in our kitchen be the first one we see when we open the cupboard. I mean, you open the cupboard, the first food you see you're three times as likely to take -than the fifth food you see. -Right. So why stack the deck against ourselves by having the least-healthy whatever... Chocolate-covered potato chips with fudge... -right front and center? -Right. And a lot of these changes are very easy things we can make so we don't stack the deck against ourselves. What we can... Oh, hey, thank you. -Thank you very much. -Yummy, yummy, yummy. For me now, to have these here, I would, and easily could, devour all of that. Oh, yeah, yeah. It's our moral obligation 'cause it's in front of us. We're not gonna waste food. The only way to change this, the only way to keep from doing that is, essentially, to change our environment. It's a lot easier to change our food environment than to change our mind. Which is why you just put that over there. The one thing that a person can control immediately tonight is what they do in their own kitchen. Right. Since doing the reboot, one rule that I made that helps me stay healthy is that I am going to keep my kitchen and my refrigerator stocked with fruits and vegetables... And having things readily available. Strawberries washed in a bowl, blueberries, bananas on the counter. I'm more likely to grab a banana if it's sitting in front of me. My top tips for eating healthier are keep it out of the house. And so out if sight, out of mind. If I keep chips or cookies or whatever in the house, I will eat it. And so even if it's not mine to eat... My husband will bring home junk food for him, and I'll end up eating it, so we've now established that the home is a healthy place, and it's really made a big difference. So I'm Dr. Carrie Diulus. I am an orthopedic spine surgeon. -Mommy... -Hey... I have struggled with weight issues my entire life. And while I was pregnant with my son, I had a lot of complications related to that, and I ended up in the hospital for well over a month. And they said, "You could have a stroke. You could permanently lose your vision." After my son was born, my vision stabilized, and all of those symptoms were going away, but they didn't know what started it, so there's always the fear that it could come back. And I really started to seek out ways to get things in balance. What do you want in your juice? -I'll show you. -All right. I got everything clean. A friend of mine had brought up this movie that she had seen, "Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead," and said, "Hey, what do you think about juicing?" So that weekend I watched the movie. I went out that day and I bought a juicer, and started doing the juice fast. And that's when I did the 42 days. I haven't had a headache since. I haven't had any problems with my vision since, and felt better than I had ever felt in my life. I didn't realize how bad I felt for so long until I felt this good. And, in fact, losing weight is probably an important but small portion of the whole equation. Good? Just the introduction of juice into our household has significantly increased the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables that the entire family eats. And I think that's really the main benefit of all of this. What'd you say, Lou? -Found you. -Found me? And now it's easy for me to see something's a little out of balance. You know, there are weekends where life is crazy and pizza happens, and pudding happens, and parties happen. And... We don't focus on it, and the next week, we eat a lot more fruits and vegetables to balance it out. What do you got, guy? Step on up. I got steaks, steaks, and more steaks. -So, what are you eating there? -French fries. -You like 'em? -Mm-hmm. How much do you like 'em? I'd say they're my third favorite food. Third favorite? You eat a lot of fruit and vegetables? Not... Not really as... Not really, no. Why do you reckon that is? I don't know. -You got kids? -Yeah, two. -How many kids? Two kids? -Two kids. And, what do they like to eat? Anything, but not veg... Not the vegetables. What about fruits and veggies? Do you ever eat fruits and veggies? Do you like fruits and vegetables? What's your favorite vegetables? Cucumbers. Cucumbers? Are fruits and vegetables a big part of your diet at home? Absolutely. So what advice would you have for some other parents that have kids that are not eating their veggies and their fruits? Try, try, and try again. If they don't eat it, continue to give it to them. And eventually they'll try it, and they may even like it. I find that if they help prepare it, they're a bit more interested in eating it. I kinda grew up with, you know, sitting at... I couldn't get out the table 'till I finished my greens, so that's kind of how I grew up. And at least now I look back on it and I thank my mom, 'cause now I know the true importance of it. The last time I caught up with Stacy Kennedy, she suggested that I should meet her husband Russ. He's a behavioral psychologist. Scoop that into the bowl. I thought he could shed some light on how we can help our kids get on the path to healthy eating. I'll smash it. So just go like this. I wanna smash it. We are setting these kids up with habits that they will take their whole lives. You know, let me give you two quick experiences that you could have for dinner. One experience is starting to hear the pots and pans and the plates and the silverware. They have these very distinct sounds. And over time, I'm just gradually brought into this experience of eating. Here's the other experience. The doorbell rings. Someone's holding two pizzas, and now you're ready to eat. So one of those situations, my body had all this time to prepare itself. My stomach muscles relaxed. The stomach organ expanded. The whole alimentary canal starts to lubricate so that the food can get down there easier. And this happens over this time while I'm preparing the food. So now, when I eat the food, my body is in this wonderful place to absorb as much of that good stuff as it can. And then I have this wonderful experience with my family. So even this is kind of creating our own culture for our boys, so that as they grow up, healthy eating is just this natural byproduct of living a life that he has deemed healthy, not because we shoved it down his face. It's 'cause he's done it, and he feels good about it. Nummy, huh? Most of us grow up learning to eat from our parents. And some of us grow up learning to eat well from our parents. But what's really knocked my socks off, and I wouldn't have believed it unless I saw it for myself is young kids teaching their mom and dad how to eat better. So I heard there was a story that you wanted to tell me that you were gonna go to a fast food restaurant. And then, what did you say to mom? I told her no, I don't want to go there 'cause they have junk food that, like, it's not good for you in your body. So where did that come from? Because I don't know too many six-year-olds who would say that to their mom. It came from my sister. Oh, really? Okay, so now the truth comes out. So do you want to tell me what the story was, Elyce? Yeah, I learned it in wellness. Everybody told us that kids wouldn't be the way to go. Get the adult first, then the kids will follow. It's been the opposite. We get the kids, and then they bring their parents into it. How are we gonna grow a healthy body? What are we gonna do? By eating healthy and doing things that are healthy. Eating all kinds of fruit and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables. I like that. Welcome, everybody. And because the parents and kids do it together, they actually get to learn together. The parent doesn't have to be the bad guy, saying "Eat your broccoli..." The kid's the one saying, "I want to eat some broccoli, Mom, let's do this together." And it becomes a really neutral environment for parents and children to learn about healthy eating, and then to take what they learned and actually take it home and implement it in their families' lives. It's because of Delani that I eat healthier. When she started bringing recipes home to make a smoothie... Like, every single day, "Please, Mommy, buy the ingredients. Please." To me, that was sort of a sign. If my four-year-old, at the time, is coming home handing me recipes to eat healthier... I'm gonna do it. Who liked the fruit salad? That fruit salad was so good. You guys did such a great job. I eat salad every day. What does mom eat? Mom? Quinoa. Your mom just eats quinoa, nothing else? She only lives on quinoa? Your mom lives on quinoa? If we can create a generation of change in East Hampton, then other communities can do it, and the whole world could do it. We could really change what could happen to our children. What's your name? -Ethan. -Hi, Ethan, how are you mate? -Good. -And you are? -Liam. -Liam, how are you? Talk me through how you got started, because I'm sure there's lots of moms that would love their six-year-old to get excited about the green juice. I started with a bit more fruit. I'd put in, let's say, watermelon, apple, orange, and then spinach and carrot. So I'd incorporate just a couple of vegetables in there, which he wouldn't really even know was happening. And then we'd move up from there. So then I would take out, let's say, you know, the orange, and pop in, you know, anything from a beet root to, you know, romaine lettuce or something along those lines. Stand up there. Since adding a daily glass of juice, to the family's diet seven months ago, Mum, Larissa, has lost over 40 pounds. But she tells me this is only a small part of the benefits the family has seen from the change. In your note to me, you mention that the young fellow here... -Me? -has had some health issues, -health problems. -Yes. Can you just talk me through and give me a bit of a background as to what the poor little fella's had to go through? Well, when Ethan was 2 1/2... He was... We were actually playing and running around, and he started saying that his ankle was really sore. And then, one day, he just stopped walking. And I took him to the hospital, and he was diagnosed with arthritis, juvenile arthritis that was in one side of his body, at that point. So it was in his left ankle, knee, and elbow. To me, arthritis was something that when you're older you get, not that a kid at 2 1/2 is gonna have to deal with. And then, over the past four years, it's just gotten worse. It had spread to then his right side, and then, just before, we started juicing, it affected his neck, and then his eyes also developed arthritis. Wow. So did they put medication to him? Did they have him take pills? So much... He... He... And he's still On some of it. We're trying to lower it at the moment. He's on something called Methotrexate. -Yep. -Which... Is essentially a mild form of chemotherapy, really. Right. And that's trying to put it into remission. And then he was on steroid in his eyes for a while there, which they've taken him off since. Which I'm so happy to say. And he's... Daily anti-inflammatories. So a lot of stuff for a little kid. -For a six-year-old, yeah. -Yeah, absolutely. So he's been juicing for... How long are we talking, about six months or...? About that. And you've seen a dramatic improvement yourself? The first thing I noticed, to be quite honest, was behavior. I noticed that his behavior calmed down, and, at school, he was just a bit more receptive. But I truly do think that he... Has been in less pain. And I think that being in less pain will then make him less irritable. And so, Ethan, do you feel better? Since you've been juicing? You do? What else do you notice? That I'm getting taller. You're getting taller? You think that juice is actually making you taller? -Really? -Because it's all vegetables. Oh, the vegetables are making you strong. I like your thinking, mate. All right, well, we'll cheers to that. Perfect. How sure are you that, by bumping up his nutrient intake with the veggies and the plants by juicing, it's had a big impact? -How sure are you? -100%. 100%. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that I have done nothing but brilliant things for his health now and his health in the future to incorporate fruits and vegetables as a daily part of their diet. You alright there, Liam? -Yes. -Okay. So another new day, another new city. And it's time to get a juice or get a smoothie or get something into my body for breakfast. Now, one of the ways I use the community is I will ping out and say, "Hey, I'm in Adelaide. Where can I get a juice?" And I've done that this morning, and Melissa, She has come back to me and said, "Try Goodies And Grains." And I've tapped it in my maps, and apparently it's just around the corner. So, time to load up on some micro nutrients. Give me veg, give me veg Give me vegetables They're the key To one's longevity He's down here. Give me veg Give me vegetables Because health Is my priority All right, we'll go down here and have a look. Do you know where goodies and grains is? It is a bit of a maze in here, but I'm sure I'll find it. Down there? Turn to the right? Is it in this lane? No, it's... Forgive me If I seem obsessed Give me veg, give me veg Give me vegetables Here it is. Organically grown Is always best Give me veg, give me veg Give me vegetables They're the key To one's longevity Okay, so what's the most popular green juice? The glorious greens. -Glorious greens? -Yes. And what's the most popular smoothie? -The Green Smoothie. -Perfect. So I'm gonna have one of each. -Okay. -Same size. -Thank you. -Thank you very much. -You juice at home? -Yeah. What do you make at home? What do we make at home when we do a juice? We make smoothies at home. Smoothies? What do you put in your smoothies? Banana. Banana? -Chocolate. -Chocolate? That doesn't sound like a smoothie to me. That sounds like a milkshake. -Here's the Green Smoothie. -All right, thank you. Okay, and the Glorious Greens Juice. Thank you very much. And do you like green juices? Do you like the green ones? -Yeah. -Cheers, girls. Try to put it on your nose. On my nose? All right, see you later. Bye. Hands on your hips. Markers are strengthened... Part of what I've learned in 36 years of doing this is what really enables people to make sustainable changes. Even more than being healthy, people want to feel free and in control. And as soon as I tell somebody, "Eat this, don't eat that, do this, don't do that," not only is it not helpful, it's usually counterproductive because they usually immediately want to do just the opposite. So instead of saying foods are good or bad, foods aren't good or bad... Food is just food. But some foods are clearly healthier for you than others. So that's different than a moral judgment. What matters most is your overall way of eating and living. Indulging yourself one day, doesn't mean you cheated or you're bad. Just eat healthier the next. You didn't have time to exercise one day, do a little more the next. You don't have time to meditate for an hour, do it for a minute... -You get the idea. -Yeah. The more you change, the better you get. Now, what's interesting, it's not like we found there's one set of dietary recommendations for reversing or preventing heart disease, another one for diabetes, a different for prostate cancer. It's the same for all of these. The more change, the more you move in a healthy direction, the more you improve in every way we can measure, -in every metric. -So explain that to me. What sort of change are we talking about? The more they change their diet, the more they exercise, they more they did meditation and yoga, the more love and intimacy they had in their life... -Right. -...the more they improve. And it comes out of your own experience, not because somebody told you that. You just think, "Oh, when I do this, I feel good, when I eat that, I don't feel so good, so maybe I'll eat more of this and less of that." And if I want to, you know, indulge myself, I'm not cheating, which, again, has that whole moralistic idea. I'm just gonna indulge myself. That's part of a healthy diet, too. Yeah. Makes sense to me. But also, just focusing on the behavior isn't enough. We have to work at what's underlying that behavior. And for many people, because of the breakdown of the social networks that used to give people a sense of connection and community, there's a lot of loneliness and depression. That's why it's important to look at our diet, not just in isolation, but as part of a larger context. And you yourself said, "When I'm stressed or I'm tired, I want to reach for sugar." For someone else, it might be fat. For someone else, it might be salt. Why are people acting this way? And when you talk with them, more often than not they'll tell you it's because it helps them get through the day. The real epidemic isn't just obesity or heart disease or diabetes, it's the depression and loneliness, and isolation. But we can break that. Spending the time with our friends and family isn't just a luxury that we do after we've done all the important stuff, it is the important stuff. Because feelings connect us, and when we feel connected, then it makes it easier to make these kinds of changes in diet and lifestyle. All right, good advice. How about we start over here and any... I'm gonna do questions. We'll move around, so we'll try and do it this way. Any questions over in this group over here? Yes? During the movie, you came in touch with the truck driver that you... What's his name? -Phil. -Phil. Have you had any news from him recently, how he's doing or... Yeah, I spoke to Phil last night, actually. -Oh, really? -So Phil is working in Detroit... He's moved up there. He was driving trucks. He went back to driving trucks. So he's still struggling with the being solo and being alone, and that sort of tends him to get off the rails. But he's off medications and... I mean, I don't... There are people that are gonna be more successful than others at this. This is not, like, a silver bullet. So I'm constantly being asked how Phil is. People really responded to his struggle, to his journey, and they rejoiced in his success. I felt that my journey was equivalent to the Forrest Gump running across America and people are just coming along and following, and Phil was the first person to follow. He was really the first person who said, "You know what? I liked what that guy did, and I saw what he did. I want to try that." And, it's Phil's story that has, inspired all these millions of people. Every day four or five people see the film, four or five people find me on Facebook, say what a true inspiration I am that I've changed my life around, and I just went back to old habits. After the 60 days, I had some friends helping me out with healthy eating and working at the "Y" there in the town. I was doing really well, and so I maintained my weight all through the next year. -So I'm, here with Phil Staples. -Hi. And, Phil and I are in Massachusetts for the screening of "Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead." As you can see, the movie changed my life. I still fit into the shirt two and a half years later. About six months after that I met a girl and moved in with her a couple months later. We got married, but wasn't ready for it. Shouldn't have done that. I wasn't ready for that. I left her and had to get divorced, and things went slowly downhill then. No one to talk to. I mean, that's kind of what started it. I was alone, and I hate it. And I would try, try and get my health back, try and, you know, try and juice on my own, try and eat healthy again. And then something would come along, and head right back to the fast food place and eat my crap, you know? I just wanted to keep hiding. I didn't want to be seen. Well, then I called Joe. And explained things to him. I said, "I'm having trouble." And that was a big relief just to say that, you know, just to get that out. 'Cause Joe... Here's Joe, "Okay, we'll work on it. You know, I care about you." And that's what I needed to hear. The struggles continued, but it's what I needed to hear. Once Phil put up his hand and asked for help, I knew he needed more than just fruits and vegetables. So I asked Russ Kennedy to wander up, talk to Phil, and see what kind of changes Phil could make. What I want to hear more about is your experience with beforehand, before you order, before you get your Baconator and Frosty, what emotion do you have going through you? -I'm empty. -Empty. So you're saying you feel kind of void, -Yeah. -That sadness, that emptiness? Well, it's beyond sadness, it's coldness. -Yeah, it is. -And it's, like, you know, when the weight's gaining and you feel that way, you know, pardon my French, but the thought always comes with me, you know? Let's go get this, it makes me feel better. When you say, "It makes me feel better," though, that's kind of what... But it's just for the briefest moments. So it's like a sensation? You're like, "Ahh?" It's like having that cigarette or having those drugs or that drink. You know, it's just for the briefest moments. And when the food is gone, the emotion's back. And when the emotion's back, the sadness comes. When we do a case study, and we look at Joe and we look at Phil, there's a lot of lessons to be learned. And some of the lessons that we can learn is that the team that Joe's surrounded with made a big difference. And the lack of team that Phil had made a huge difference. However, the really important thing to take home from this is that the environment and the situation that Phil ended up in is amazingly common. You know, he had some emotional difficulties, he had a divorce, it was very difficult for him. And he got very disconnected. And his lapse turned into a relapse. So where Joe was successful... Having the right team, Getting the right importance and meaning, and having people in his life who would call him out on it... Phil didn't have such a system. The only connection that he had to food was the temporary sensation of contentment. So I feel that community, and the system that you make within that community, acts as this great buffer against difficult emotional experiences that we're all gonna go through. I mean, to go through these things is to be human. And it is what Joe put in place. He put a community around him that gave him a great buffer zone, that keeps him accountable and it keeps him on the high path, on the healthy path. Well, in our practice, when someone first comes to us, we kind of treat it like an emergency time. Like, your house is on fire, we got to put this fire out first. And then can we get help and support by having these helpful and healthy relationships? And then the third thing we really
