Please... What... What happened? Everything's going to be all right. You can relax, it's okay. I want you to close your eyes. We need to schedule another procedure. Okay, sweet dreams. Ah! Unh... Aah! Help... Help. Help?! Help! Aah! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Hello, my name is Dr. Klein, and today I'd like to discuss your postoperative recovery. Who am I? Why am I here? These questions take on a new significance here at the Klein Institute. Dealing with the necessary immunosuppression protocols, memory loss, and a host of psychological issues will be a challenge. I realize that to look in the mirror and see a stranger every day can prove to be more unsettlig than the fear of tissue rejection itself. To hear your voice altered by the many months of intubation and the changes in your mouth and lips can be disorienting, but you must remember that no matter the face that looks back, you are you... the same person you've always been. Although you may feel alone, you must remember that you are surrounded by people that love and support you. They may need time to adjust, but rest assured, in time they will come to see you for who you are. So I challenge you to be you, and to embrace your new life. Now let's begin by going through, step by step, what you can except over the coming weeks and months with your new transplant. Our first challenge will be avoiding some common side effects, things like graft edema, acute respiratoy distress syndrome, and jugular thrombosis. Wait... Who are you? Who are you? Dealing with the necessary immunosuppression protocols, memory loss, and a host of psychological issues will be a challenge. Yet together, we can make ths difficult road seem less daunting. Dr. Klein created this drug therapy specifically matched to your DNA, dramatically improving recovery times with only very minimal side effects. In rare cases, mild hallucinatory episodes and memory loss have been reported, but nothing to be concerned about. We're all so proud of you, George. All the years of trial and error. All the naysayers. You represent Dr. Klein's greatest achievement. Well, I believe that, uh... this lovely woman would be kind enough to offer you a lift. It took us a while, but we found her. Good luck, George. You okay? I was in the hospital for... I don't know how long, and I didn't have one visitor, not even my mother. Georgie. Not one, except... You are certainly not above hurting people. Did I hurt you? You really got whacked good, huh? Jesus Christ. Fuck. Sorry. I, uh... I thought... thought it was a bullshit con, man. Look, um... if you want your job back at the bar... stop by, all right? Most patients experience some significant but temporary memory loss, and in more rare occasions, hallucinatory episodes. I need you to dig deep and focus on relationships. Hey, George! I wasn't sure you'd come. It's good to see you. Hey, get a room! Hey, shut the fuck up. Grab a seat. We win big? You don't remember? Yeah, well, that's pretty fucking convenient for you, right? Oh, wait... yeah, wow. I was very jealous of you for this one. She was nice, too. You really fucked that up. But no redheads. Uh, no. Not that I recollect, no. But, uh... You, uh... you have a lot of secrets, George. We were good friends, yeah? Known each other a long time, yeah. What did I do that... I barely get to see my daughter because of getting in too deep with you. I almost lost this bar. Still paying that off. We'll just leave it there, all right? Tom... I'm not living like that anymore. Yeah, well, I love you, man, but, uh... you're gonna have to do a lot more than bus a few tables. Relax. I've seen worse, baby. If you're real, say something. Do something. Get the fuck off me! Get off me! No! Aah! Get off me! He was right on me! - Where? - No, he was right there. What are you talking about? There's... - I... - What happened? He was right there. But I don't see anything. There's nobody here. I know, I know. I saw it. It all happened right there. George, you ran to the bar, you come right back, the body's gone. Are you sure it's not your meds fucking with you? What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm calling your mom. Somebody tried to take this! There's no blood, George. There's no blood anywhere. Maybe... I don't know. Um, the car just... If... If he's not here, then he's out there looking for me. I mean, are you listening to yourself, how crazy you sound? All right, let's get you to the ER. George. Let's get you to the ER, all right? Y-you're a mess. All right? - No! - Your face is a fucking mess. No, no. I'm never going back. Do you hear me, I'm never going back there. Who am I? Why am I here? These questions take on a new significance here at the Klein Institute. Hello, my name is Dr. Klein, and today I'd like to discuss your postoperative recovery. Every patient plays a crucial role... After all, who better than yourself to notice changes, discoloration, or movement of the scar tissue? But I realize that to look in the mirror and see a stranger every day.. I don't want it anymore! It's not mine, now, take it off! I changed my mind! I stopped taking my pills. You've gotta take it off now! No! No! I don't want it anymore. It's not mine, I'm taking it off! I changed my... You've gotta take it off! No, no! Take it off! - Get away! - Calm down! Take it off! I don't want it! - Take it off! - Calm down! Take it off! No! The changes in your mouth and lips can be disorienting. Dealing with the necessary immunosuppression protocols, memory loss, and a host of psychological issues will be a challenge. But you must remember that no matter the face that looks back, you are still you, the same person you've always been. Hello? Hello? Hello?! Hello! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Dr. Bruce, telephone, please. Dr. Bruce, telephone, please. George! Hello. How are you? What happened to your chin? That's why I'm here. Jesus, we need to look at that immediately. - You taking your meds? - Yeah. All right, well... I wanted to talk to you about a conference that the, uh... George, I wanted to talk to you about a... a conference that the Radiological Institute of North America have coming up. About you attending as our guest of honor. If you're up for it. Am I the "before" or "after" photo? Very good. Getting our sense of humor back, are we? That's the spirit. I think the conference will do wonders for your confidence. Really prove to you how important you are for this whole program. Well, we'll talk. I'll see you inside. I'll alert the others. George! You scared me. Oh, my goodness, what happened? I need to know who my donor was. I'm sorry, George, but... Metzger won't tell me, you know that. I know this is gonna sound insincere, but you look good, George, you really do... you're a miracle. You know that, don't you? All of us on the floor think so. I have a right to know. Please. I'm a single mom, two girls. I cannot risk my job, please. You know how I woke up this morning? In my johnnies, on the floor, on fire. I'm begging you. I'm losing my mind, I need to know. It's the best I can do. Just trust me. Go. What'd ya do? It's gonna come out anyway. What'd you do? Nothing. I was, uh... was, uh, attacked. It's a ticking time bomb. They all fail eventually. Our bodies are too smart. It never stops... ticking. Oh... shh! - I can hear it. - Please. You're a fool. We're alive, aren't we? Oh! Uh... Hey, uh... Hey, how about a hand over here? I guess I should apologize for the first time we met. Who are you? Uh... My name is Sophie. Allen. - I'm a mental health... - In my room. ...counselor in the... You were in my room. Uh, thank you, James, I'll get that later. We should probably get started. George, do you mind? Okay, uh, sorry I'm late, you guys. Where... were we last week? Uh, Donald, I think it was with you, about your sister. I wanna know who my donor was. That's a subject that comes up a lot. Right, guys? But... Knowing doesn't necessarily help the recovery process, does it? Plus, confidentiality agreements prohibit contact between patient and donor families. But if you want to, we can discuss your feelings... This isn't about my feelings. My donor attacked me. - That's not possible. - I saw it with my own eyes. The man had no face, it was real. Alexander... Hey, we're all doubling up on our meds, okay, buddy, so back off! Um, I think we're gonna call it there, guys. I'll see you next week, okay? Forgot to pay your rent? You followed me here. There's a reason you came to see me. What was it? Tell me. Please. Just tell me. I'm calling Dr. Metzger. You knew him, didn't you? He's dead. You sure about that? I guess no one's come by. We look good together, don't you think? It's none of your business. What was his name, by the way? Eik. He was an orderly at the hospital. Look, you got what you came for. I want you to leave now. I don't like you going through his stuff. This expires in three days. That doesn't mean anything. No? Who are these people? What does this have to do with you? I don't know. You tell me. There you go, on the house. Thanks. Why didn't he find me? If he was alive, I would have been the first person... Maybe he was protecting you from something. Maybe you didn't know him as much as you thought. Look, the guy had a photo of me 'cause he was looking for me... and he found me. That doesn't make any sense. I know. How does a schmuck who looks like this end up with a girl looks like you? He was... He was funny. And smart. And I loved him. I didn't even realize that they salvaged his... I had no idea until I saw you. It was a shock, as I'm sure you can imagine. Well, at least he left something behind. Helped somebody in need. Hey. What can I get you fellas? Yeah, uh, I'll take a, uh... apple martini. We're looking for George. Yeah, I, uh... I don't know any George. That's funny... 'cause his piece-of-shit car is parked down the street. Haven't seen him in months. What's up with your friend? Wear your seatbelt, that's what. You ain't kiddin'. Tell him to call this number. Tell him it's a burner so he don't need to be worried about it, you got it? Yeah, I got it. Then why the fuck is this piece of paper still in my hand? By the way, I, uh, saw somebody slashed his tires. Ain't that a shame? We'll be back. What the fuck, George? Huh? Already? Why don't you call it a night, Before you get my place shot up again? Sorry, miss. Use the back door. What was all that about? Apparently I'm a shithead. God, this is all so confusing. I mean, I know he's gone and you're not him, but... I don't think we should do this again, George. - No? - I'm sorry. - Look, please. - I can't. Please. Wait. This was Eik's. I want you to have it. - What? - Nothing. Uh... I don't know, the watch. Well, what is it? Well, it's nothing. It's, uh, really nice. We've done just about all we can do. We need to schedule another procedure. Sometimes a little pain can help you feel like yourself again. What did you do? What happened today cannot happen again. Why don't you do... Jesus! You scared the crap out of me. Well, it's you. You want one? It's bad for the complexion. That was a joke. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, it's just these damn pills. Mama's got a customer. - Someone's following me. - Just stay away. I have no idea why. I have to remember who I am. - I need your help. - I barely know you, George. - I knew your donor. - But you know about this, right? You know about triggering memories, don't you? - I don't... - There's someone following me and I don't know who it is and I don't know why. I need to find out. Do... Childhood photographs? You've seen your mother, you went to your apartment. There is one person I haven't seen yet. But... I don't wanna do it alone. Is that him? I think. Shut up! Yeah, that's him. This is a mistake. Remember why you're here. Yeah. Well, what do you know? It's the masked man again. Holy shit, I think this is him. What? Is that you, George, behind that Mona Lisa? Why are you doing this? That's what we don't get. What's your angle? If you bozos did your research, then you know who I am, right? Shit, what's that? That supposed to scare me, old man? What the fuck are you, some kind of cop? I'm worse. Ex-cop. Fuck you, we just want our money. You're trespassing, understand? I got every right here, you both got shit. See you around real soon, Georgie. - Real soon. - Get the hell outta here. Nice playmates. Thank you for that. Friends of yours? I don't know. What's this supposed to be, huh? Ain't we been through enough, your ma and I? What have you been through? Tell me everything. Oh! Really? How I know it's you anyway? - What's going on? - No, no, no, no. Mitch, George, please, come on! Shut up! - How tall are you? - Are you serious? You don't look like my George. You don't sound like my George. The George I know sure as hell wouldn't have cowered like some pussy. Whatever it is that happened in the past, I'm sorry. Yeah, I know my shithead son. And I know... this ain't him. Well, you may be a fuck-up. But that's all you two have in common. Whoever you are. Oh, please! Please! Let's get the fuck out of here. Just stop. It never goes like it's supposed to. Not at first. Sophie, what if he's right? What is it? This one patient... He stopped coming to sessions one day. He just vanished. The last time I saw him, he told me he was being followed. Just like you. He said it was like this person... Wanted his face back. I don't understand. We've got to find the donors, all of them. Yeah, if I could get... if I could get access to the Reconstructive Wing. But it's restricted even for me. Could I get in? I mean... if your face was being rejected, or... or worse. But we don't want that. Promise me you won't do anything stupid. No... No, no. Hey, beautiful. Oh! Great, look who it is. Back from the dead, again. Hey, uh, look who it is. The same loser who still can't turn a profit. Oh, and your one lone customer, Howie. Hey. What are you doing? Ah! Watered-down vodka. Up to your same old tricks. You can put that on my tab. Easy, easy. You and I need to talk. What the fuck, man? What are you doing? - What are you doing? - I need a favor from you. Am I in the fucking Twilight Zone right now? Look, we both know I've done you wrong in the past. - Yeah, and more than you know. - Now is your chance. - Make it good. - What? What are you acting crazy for? - Tom. - Yeah? You're a fucking idiot. What are you talking about? Can't see your daughter and you almost lost your bar because of me, yet you invite me back into your life? You know how pathetic that is? You're a fucking loser. You think you've changed? You haven't changed. You know why you keep me around? 'Cause you're a chump. Go ahead, right here. Right here. Do it, you fucking pussy. Right here! Fuck. Goddamn it! Open up! Please! Open up! Open up! - Help! Help! - Hey! Open the fucking door! I'm worried about your tissue antigens. We've done just about all we can do. We're mitigating the inflammation, but... any more movement of your scar tissue and... your face could shift irrevocably. I'm concerned about you, George. Disappearing the other day. Now this. I need you to be honest with me. Did you hurt yourself? If you did, you can tell me. It's not uncommon with a transplant patient. Nothing to be embarrassed about. I just want to make sure that you get the appropriate care, both physically and mentally. Tell me about Eik, doc. Well, that's a tricky road to go down right now. Is it? Considering your emotional state. But, all right. Dr. Klein insisted that we all sign up to be donors. Set an example. I'm a donor myself. Eik saved your life. That's all you need to know. I'm scheduling a psych examination for you before I release you. It's for your own good. Is that a threat? Oh, George. Do you know how important you are to me personally? I only want to help. And I need you to be strong. For all those watching to see you make a full recovery. Good timing. Get some rest, George. Please, think about it. That was incredibly foolish! Well, it worked, didn't it? What's that? Oh... I just, I got you... something that... Thanks. This is nice. Put it on. Now? Or later. - How do I look? - Good. Thank you. Yeah, of course. I thought it might make you feel more like yourself, despite all of this. Yeah, I guess you don't like the old George's fashion sense, huh? That's fine, I guess you know me better than I know myself. But... this feels right. Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure. So, the donor files are located in the HLA typing lab. It's usually locked with a coded entry. What do you mean, usually? There are more people rooting for you than you might think, George. Yeah, baby, you know I do, damn. That bitch don't mean nothing to me. I told you. How many times do I have to tell you? You just keep on, keep on keeping on... It was supposed to anesthetize my eyes, you know? But all I felt was liquid flowing out, all down my cheeks. I guess they missed. Then they said they couldn't wait. You know how, in those old movies, when like the guy gets clobbered and he starts seeing stars? Well, that was me. The pain was so intense, I swear I started seeing stars exploding around my head. After I stopped screaming, I could see the medic, like all the color was drained from his face. I knew I must be in serious trouble. Thank you, Chuck. I think we should probably just cut off there. What is it? - What is it? - Did you even know Eik? Yeah, of course. Why? What does... Why haven't you gone to the cops? George. Why haven't you gone to the cops? Because if you knew that Eik was onto something, that maybe they were tricking donors or worse, - and you never reported it... - Tell me what happened. - No, I'm asking you. - George. Do you think I'm involved in this? No, I don't. You wanna know? You gave me Dr. Klein's watch. Dr. Klein? Why would Eik have Dr. Klein's watch? - Yeah, exactly. - I don't know. - I don't know! - Why? He said it was a gift. What was your involvement with Klein? - George, stop. - Your involvement. - Stop! - Were you two together? - No! God, no! - Bullshit! What do you expect me to believe? What do you expect me to believe? George! 'Cause I killed him. I killed him. Oh, G... Everything okay, George? I don't like the look of that scar tissue. Can you smell that? How did Dr. Klein die? In a freak accident... In the lab. Here at the hospital? They still couldn't save him. Poor bastard. Locked behind his lab door. Just 20 feet away from the world's best trauma docs. Ironic, huh? Gonna have that doc check you out, George. I need to be able to trust you. You're all I have. If I can't trust you, I... Come with me. He donated his body to medical research. Now every department's competing over who gets to use the esteemed Dr. Klein. It's morbid. I need to know how. I confronted him in his lab after Eik went missing. I accused him of stealing faces, and he... Oh, God. It was self-defense. I grabbed glass tubes, jars, whatever I could find. Turned out one was acid. He tried to strangle me. So I pushed him off and I ran. That's why I can't go to the authorities. I thought they were gonna get away with it, too, until I met you. But... What? I don't think this is actually him. What do you mean? Who is this? I don't know. Does a world-class surgeon have chewed fingernails? Calluses? If he's still alive, he won't stop. He was obsessed with his work, his legacy. - Please, you have to believe me. - Believe you? George, please, I can't do this by myself. I don't know what happened to Eik or why he had Klein's watch. But I do know that Klein killed Eik and forced him to become a donor. And if Klein's still alive, it's gonna keep happening. Shit. - What? - Shit. Come on. We've got to save her. Who? Who are you talking about? No! No, no, no! It's okay... this way, this way! Hey, hey! I saw her get picked up by that same white van. - Who are you talking about? - And then... - What? - And then she was downstairs with her face all marked up. George, they came down here? Who are you talking about? Downstairs! Downstairs! Fuck! What?! George! What the hell's happening? Wait. I know you. George! No! George! Stay still! No! No! Get off me! No, no! What did you do with Sophie? She's been terminated, George. No, no, no. It's... it's not her fault, you don't under... No, it's... it's me. It's me. It's... it's the meds. My mind is... So you're still having trouble remembering your past. Tell me what you remember. I remember... I remember my dad. I remember Tom, my friend. I remember I'm in trouble. I remember... I owe people money. I... So there are people who know you. Have you tried reconnecting in a meaningful way... Yeah, but my dad doesn't even want to acknowledge that I exist. He doesn't even... All right, George, your scarring's not healing the way we wanted. Your face has shifted under the weight of the new damage. We need to reschedule another procedure. No, no, please, I... I can't go under the knife so soon. - Please, don't. - All right. All right, we'll cross that bridge when our options run out. But the best thing you can do in the meantime is to start healing this. I need you to dig deep, confront those hard relationships. Don't hide from your demons. Sometimes a little pain can help you feel like yourself again. I know what I have to do. Good. Can I get a moment? Tom. Yeah, every... everything's fine. I... I need one last favor. Tom? Tom?! Tom called your mother. You've gotta get out of here. - What? - Oh, no, you have to get... Your mother, in her heart, she blames me, you know. Going to the track was something I did with my own father. - You had to go and ruin it. - Please. You have to go. You have to go, please. Look, hey... I've been around way too long... and I know how your story's gonna end. But here... Take this. It's the best I can do. Here. Take it. It's a bus ticket outta town and three grand to get you started. You said you changed. Go start anew. No, I can't. You have to go. There's nothing good left for you here. That includes your mother, you understand? Okay, please, just go. Don't you recognize a second chance when you see it? Please, just go. Just... Please, Jesus Christ, please, go. I tried. Just go, just go. Now, this... It's just like the good old days. Hiya, Georgie. Where's, um... - that other guy? - Let's settle this. Make it easy on everybody. But how do you know you have the right guy? - Fuckin' games. Enough! - How do you know? How do you know? You really don't remember, do you? No! I don't. Huh. You're missing a tooth. You bit me, you degenerate fuck! No, no, no, it's okay. He's with me. No! No! No! Dad! Dad... Dad! Dad! No! Dad! You said nobody would miss the bodies. - What? - Don't be fucking stupid. We delivered them just like you asked for. Alive and kickin', and with real pretty faces, too. No. No. But enough, you stupid sack of shit! I don't know what scam you're playing at. I don't give two fucks. What, did that surgery add testicles to you, too? What makes you think you can fuck with us, Georgie? You better do the math real fast. Or we're gonna take back what we delivered. You follow? Ah, m... Dad! Dad! Dad, no. Dad, Dad, no. No, I'm... I'm sorry. Dad. Dad, please. Who... Who... are you? Dad, no, no, no. Dad, no. No, no, Dad. Dad! - George? - Dad, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, George, what happened? I worked for Klein. What? I worked for Klein. What are you talking about? What do you mean you worked for Klein? I worked for him, I found all of them, all the donors. All those marks, people who wouldn't be missed. What? George. Donors. People who wouldn't be missed. I found Eik. Eik? No. No, that's not possible. We gotta go. - Come on. - At least I know who I am now. - I know who I am! - No! No, please, that's not you, Okay? - That was Klein. - Klein's dead. No, he's not! I'm the one you want, I'm the one you want. George, look at me! George! Klein's not dead! Please. He's alive. And he's coming for me. Please. Please. Come on, George, come on. Come on... come on! No! George! Wait! - What are you doing? - George! Get... Get the fuck off me! She's manipulating you, George! You're not thinking right, man! Enough! Klein. Klein! Stop this nonsense and return to your rooms immediately! Take this thing off! What the f... Stop! Stop! Get it off of me! No. Hey... Hey, it's... It's all waiting for you... Eh? Just like you left it. This is... this is not my fault. - He saw me! - He saw you? Are you fucking serious? Not this shit! What should we fucking do with her? Look, man, it's over. He saw me. Oh, he saw your face? Doc insisted that we follow the sequence. All you had to do was stay away, stay hidden so he couldn't see you until he woke up. Why the fuck are you out of your room? I've done everything he's asked. When am I gonna be done with this? When can I be done? When? When am I... - When am I done with this? - Now. You said he'd have to go. You said it'd have to be done. You did. You said a degenerate man like that wouldn't be able to stay hidden long. - You said... - Don't understand. Wake up. Wake up, Doc. Wake up! I've done everything you've asked. Wake the fuck up already, Doc! No! You're not him! No! No! No! You're not... Remember what you said to me when I saved you? Remember that? Help me remember! I don't know what to do anymore. I've done everything you've asked for. Wake up, Doc! Come on, already, fuck. Snap out of it, man. I've done everything you've asked. Just tell me what to do. Just tell me what to do, I'll do it. I'll do it. No... You knew your dad. You knew him. You said, "That's him." Remember who did this to you. Remember who did this to you! You're not him... You're not him... You're not him. You're not him. Tell me what to do. I'll do it for you. You're not him! You're not him! Tell me what to do and I'll do it for you. - I'll do it for you. - You're not him! Tell me what to do, Doc. Tell me what to do and I'll do it. I think I love her. I saw what you all said I would see, but I didn't remember. That... No. The only thing I do remember is... you trying to kill me. You killed Eik. You turned me into that... So, what now, Sophie? Huh? What now? I hate you. I think I need a new face. All of my dream faded it seems Just like the morning dew And every plan that we both began Has all been shattered, too I don't know why I should cry over you Sigh over you Even be blue I should have known that you'd leave me alone And break my heart in two Although you have left me alone to pine All of my love was a waste of time Someday your heart will be broken like mine...
