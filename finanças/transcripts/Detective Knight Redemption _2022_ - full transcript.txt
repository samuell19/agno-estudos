Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! We're here to make a withdrawal. Ho, ho, fucking ho. Santa wants to know who's in charge of these outrageous overdraft fees. Put the money in the bag. My friends, this bank is an institution of corruption. What a good little girl. Santa won't forget you. This is what you worship, your money. This place only cares about your money! You wanna hurt them? This is how you hurt them. You take what's precious to them. Christmas is coming. So, I wanna say, "Merry Christmas, sheep," because you will unwrap a present which is the great liberation! And it will destroy this civilization just like an earthquake from the Book of Revelations! Everybody get up! Move! Up! Move! Let's go! Move! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Hurry the fuck up! You remind me of my mother. - I liked my mother... - Go! ...but I never forgave her for bringing me in to this horrible world. Because you have been such good boys and girls, you can unwrap one gift early. Merry Christmas. Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! You so-called men of law enforcement have imprisoned the people of this country for far too long. It's time you learn the true meaning of Christmas. Kill them all. Our main priority is IDing suspects. We'll give the FBI and the mayor's office our full cooperation. Understood? Damn, we got hit today. And we lost. But as long as we are standing and-- and we remember what we're standing for, we will always win. They come at you with a knife, you come at them with a gun. They come at you with a gun, I will-- Swear to God I will get you a fucking tank. I wanna see whoever did this shit stand trial. Are we clear? Let's get to work. James Edward Knight. Ex-cop. Ex-husband. Ex-military. That's a lot of exes, Mr. Knight. Can appreciate that. - Mail. - Tour in Afghanistan followed by stints as a cop in both Newark and Los Angeles. As many arrests as you had citations. Mr. Knight, you are a guest in my fine establishment, awaiting trial. There will be no special privileges. You will be alone at night, but during the day you will be with general population. There'll be no bullshit. There'll be no gambling. There will be no fighting. I expect you to see the preacher once a day. We are all God's children, Mr. Knight, but this is my house. Welcome home. Think you're gonna fit right in. Mail. District Attorney. "Casey Rhodes, on behalf of the public defenders office we hereby ask that you consider the plea agreement set forth..." "Twenty-five years incarceration." The Almighty has blessed us with Jaden. But now he has to go and walk in the light. And we offer our congratulations. Stand up, Jaden. Come on. Get up. Thanks, guys. Hey, you became a man in here, okay? Fuck. Hello, this is Casey Rhodes from the department of absentee fathers. No, no, no, babe, I'm so-- I'm sorry. I was trying to be funny. No wait. Hey, come on. Gimme a sec. Can-- Just put-- Do me a-- Just put Clara on for a second. Put-- Babe, put Clara on the fucking phone. Put-- Darling, I get one-- two minutes here. Come on. All right, finally. All right. Here we go. All right. Start here, nighty-night. Mmm, okay. Detective, your bet. All right, I'll see you. I raise you one. The flippity floppity. Geez, the Holy Ghost. How's it going, Father? Well said. Good, good. Can I join you guys? Fuck off. You all talk tough. You wanna know what tough is? Change. Because change takes sacrifice. Yeah. You have to be free in here first before you can be free out there. Yeah, says the guy peddling religion. I may be a religious man, but I'm not selling religion. I'm selling freedom. Brother Rhodes, what are you willing to do to see your family and be free again? Anything. I'd do anything. You're a fucking drug addict, Casey. Daddy! You're in hell right now, brother. I've been right where you are. They tossed me in jail and threw away the key. All that pain. All that rage. Don't you waste it. Let it purify you, brother. Let it become your guiding star. Think about your family. Think about all the good you can do for them. And I promise you'll rise again like a phoenix. Greater than you've ever been. I believe in you, Casey Rhodes. Do you believe in yourself? A group calling themselves the real saints of Christmas have claimed responsibility for the spate of bombings across New York City. Ho! Ho! Ho! This is a liberation. Get on the ground! Get on the ground and pray to your favorite god. You're gonna all be famous. This is my present to you. Merry fucking Christmas. The great liberation is at hand, and you are a part of it. We're going-- Get them up. Get them in the vault. Someone blast a hole in those security cameras. Get them in there. But I'm not selling religion. I'm selling freedom. Stand up, Jaden. Come on. Get up. Thanks, guys. Brother, med, please. My vision is clear... Get in there. Move! Move! Get into the vault. ...because of your heroism and your loyalty, brother. But I've got no room for dead weight. What-- What happened to no man left behind? They left us all behind. I need more men. Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main hall. What, you in the Christmas spirit? You're gonna drop the charges on my partner? 'Tis the season. He did the right thing, Cap. Look, I try and write him letters. I try and call him. He won't speak to me. He won't let me tell him that-- He did what every partner should do and had my back. He ignored due process. He desecrated the oath he took. Yeah, Knight would call that a good day's work. You following the Christmas bomber? What, you're gonna pin all that shit on him too? I'm out of cards to play. FBI, CIA... ...nobody has any leads. We ran a gait analysis, ran every shell fired through IBIS. Nothing. This guy's a ghost. But Knight has done more with less. You and I both know Knight would say yes to joining the hunt. No, no, no. Knight has dedicated his life to this job. He lost his wife, his relationship with his kid, and his freedom. And if he catches the bomber, maybe he gets one of those three back. Don't turn him into a monster just to catch a monster. I got a city too scared to leave their houses. I got a madman blowing up banks on Christmas. And I got a mayor that-- Never mind. No, no, no. Finish that sentence. What-- What about the mayor? Forget what I said about the mayor. And don't you even think about coming to New York. Padre... ...what brings you down here? Hi, Warden. How's your night going? Terrible. Seems like it's a damn sight better than yours? You're very intuitive. Yeah. I don't know what I'm doing out here this time of night. I know it's a mistake. I had a dream. Yeah, about the guys. About some of the men in prison. I was-- I just wanna check on them, make sure they're okay. You had a dream? Like a-- Like a premonition? Like a-- Like a vision. So, what prisoner are we dreaming about? All of 'em. All of them? Yeah. Yeah, I know this was a mistake. I-- If they see me out here, they're gonna think something's amiss. That's gonna create all kinds of drama. I didn't want that. I think you're right there. I think you're right. Yeah. No. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. The security center. I could look through the monitors. They wouldn't see me. It would set my mind at ease. I would feel so much better. No. Yeah, yeah. You're right. Padre. Yeah? Come on. It's Christmas. Let's take a look, shall we? Okay. Yeah. Let's take a look. You're a good man. I know. All present and accounted for. Of course they are. I run a tighter ship than Lord Nelson ever did. Now, Father Conlan, what was your vision? Oh, I envisioned your death. Can I have your attention, my brothers? I bring you great Christmas tidings. Today is the beginning of the liberation. So prepare yourselves. Hmm. Let it begin. Where are you, Brother Rhodes? Hey, man. You all right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And unto you, this day was born a savior. And the wages of sin is death. And freedom is a gift. You have incarcerated your brothers which is not abided by-- by any other species. So today, I give the gift of freedom to my brothers. Because freedom is their birthright. Freedom is what we will take. Merry Christmas, motherfuckers! Ho! Ho! Ho! Five guards are confirmed dead and 42 convicts escaped from New York's Rikers maximum security prison tonight. The police have released a description of one of the suspects. Ricky Conlan, a former marine turned prison chaplain, who is also now being sought for questioning regarding the Christmas bombing attacks on the city's banks. US marshals have been dispatched... You can leave. I thought you'd split with the rest of 'em. A good bed is, uh-- is hard to find. I need your read on a suspect. Tell me what every cop and profiler from Quantico to Camp Perry isn't seeing. His real name is Richard Ricky Conlan. Conlan was Special Ops. Then he went rogue. He fought with his CO, got court-martialed, sentenced to seven years in supermax. While inside, Conlan's son was killed in action and he was refused permission to attend the funeral. Somewhere in there, he discovered his spiritual side. Got out ten years ago. Ever since, Conlan's been working as a prison counselor. Everyone we speak to says he's a pillar of the community. Best thing since Mr. Rogers. Now that he's been ID'ed, FBI link him for 21 homicides, eight armed bank robberies. Never showed his face before last night, when he busted out your bestie, Casey Rhodes, and other hard-core degenerates. Why didn't you break out? I'm wasting my time here. Whenever I had a tough case, I remind myself one thing. What? Everyone bleeds. You can't be saying shit like that. You are about to stand trial for the murder of two suspects. I killed more than two. Okay, that is not something to be proud of. I killed some bad guys. It was a good day. Everyone has a right to due process. You swore an oath to serve and protect. I own what I did. You're a disgrace. You're a vigilante. Why didn't you break out? I'm a cop. It's how I'm wired. I believe in the rule of the law. You are not a cop. You are a criminal who had a badge and thought it gave him the right to do whatever the hell he wanted. I need your help. I need you to pretend to be a cop one more time. I don't like you. I don't respect you. But you can do things I cannot do. In another life, Conlan is you. The drive, the self-righteousness. Stop Ricky Conlan and the DA will drop all charges against you. Why me? 'Cause you could have broke out with the rest of the guys in your cell block and you chose not to. You chose to do the right thing. You're no better than the guys you killed or locked up, but there's still good in you. And because you're the only guy I know who might be crazier than Ricky is. I am flattered. But understand this. He's not robbing banks. He's putting on a show. How do you know that? Think like a criminal. It tracks. Any leads? Wanna hear a bad joke? Always. When the last bank was hit in Midtown, someone had an appointment with the manager at the same time and didn't show. Guess who it was. The pope? Close. Vassetti. The mayor. One and only. Someone tipped him off. Yeah. Tell me I'm not making the worst decision of my life. I wanna catch this guy. Give me my gun, and I'll do the rest. Conlan comes to me alive. Got it? James Knight versus a psychotic bank robber. Let's hope the city's still standing come Christmas morning. He seems like a lot of fun. He's probably a Jets fan. Look, I'm not really into this cult shit. Let's get the fuck out of here. How are the libations, my brothers? Let's go. Hear what he has to say and leave? When that man speaks, you listen. Dajon barks like a dog, but he's a loyal one. My brothers... the time is upon us for the great liberation. But I ask you one small favor. I ask you to trust. Trust that together we can change the world. Trust that when we move as one, that those sheep out there will tremble in fear at the sight of us. There are more people in prison in this country than any other nation on the planet. 74% of souls in cages haven't even been convicted of a crime. They're in there because they can't afford to pay bail. They can't even pay their mortgage, their rent, while their brothers in their mansions laugh at them. We're persecuting the poor. It makes my blood boil. And I was a soldier for this country. I spilled blood in countries you can't even find on a map. They asked me to execute people who did not deserve to die. And when I stood against them, they threw me in a cage too. Yes, they did. And then when my son died in combat... ...I couldn't even see my own son's body be lowered into the ground. Tell me that's not cruel. Tell me that's not torture. The corruption of this sick and diseased civilization, we have to wipe it out. We have to burn their sick egos to the ground and raise this whole country and start fresh and anew. Look at this holiday. Christmas. They've perverted this holiday. They've turned it into a giant mall of consumerism. We have to take it back. We have to make it ours. This blessed day will no longer be corrupted by their ugliness. We will bring that change. Because this is war. And there will be no prisoners. And when they think of Christmas... ...they will think of us. But those of you who do not want to be here for this great liberation... ...there's the door. No offense, no disrespect, but, uh, yeah, fellas, I'm out. Feliz Navidad. Pussy. No, no, no. No, Dajon. That man wants to be free. And our gift to him is his freedom. Just make sure he finds the right way out. Celebrate tonight, my brothers. Tomorrow, we begin. Brother Rhodes. You're not drinking. No. No, I'm, uh-- You know, I'm not thirsty, so... Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me and don't ever cover for anyone. Uh, Father, uh... A favor to ask you. No. Don't even know what I'm gonna ask you. You wanna call your family and tell them you're okay. No. What if I make a trade with you? You've realized you're more than your addiction. Very good. Make it quick. Nice speech. You'll have a nice day on the swings. It's gonna be so fun. Yeah. God. Look, stop following us, okay? I don't know where Casey is. Ugh. I'm sorry, honey. It's okay. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah? Well, I had a nightmare. Yeah? Daddy never came home because he was drowning. I tried to save him, but I couldn't. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Can I call him? Not today. There's gonna be no crying in this household over Daddy, okay? Okay. Okay? Mommy is getting a phone call. But go-- go play. Okay. - Hello? - Hello, this is from the department of absentee fathers. Calling again. Hi, Mom. What the fuck are you doing? How are you holding up? Not great. How is she doing? She's confused. More questions every day, wondering where her dad is, and why I don't let her watch the TV. Look, please don't tell me that you're-- you're part of the jailbreak. I, uh, kind of got mixed up in it, darling. I don't know how it happened, but... ...I couldn't spend another day in that cell. How could you be so stupid? Pretty much used up all the stupid getting this far, huh? They say the guy who orchestrated the jailbreak is-- is the Christmas bomber. Honestly, I'd rather you be inside and alive than-- Instead of what? Dead? Inside is pretty much the same exact thing. Ugh, God. I just feel like you don't-- you don't think. You don't think at all. You don't fucking think. No, I can fix this, darling. No, you can't. You can't fucking fix this. You sound like an addict. I'm with Conlan right now, okay? I can maybe cut a deal. I need you to call the police, tell them what I just told you, okay? I'm gonna text you the address right now. Don't give up on me, okay? I love you. Prove it. Casey Rhodes. We had such high hopes for you. What? Put her through. Mrs. Rhodes, what can I do for you? Casey called me. He's with the bomber. When did you talk to him? Just now. Did he give you an address? Look, I need your word that all the charges against Casey will be dropped. Full immunity. I can say with confidence that the mayor and the DA's office would be willing to cut a deal. Send me something in writing, and I'll send you the address. Oh, God. Hold it! Hold it right there! This was his B team. Conlan left 20 minutes before we showed up. He might have been tipped off. I put my ass on the line for you. I got you out to get results. His team prepped here. They paid cash. The landlord has no idea. None. They don't know where he is. Conlan is always one step ahead. Do the Feds have anything? They know less than we do. There's only one witness that we haven't questioned. We cannot get the mayor involved. You said to do whatever it takes. This is what it takes. All right, I'll-- I'll meet with him, okay? You're a good one, Captain. Don't I know it. Hey, my son plays the cello. Yeah, you're pretty good at it. No, no, don't-- don't stop, please. You try playing for four hours. Uh, that'll be a hard pass. Exactly. You a cop? Why? Fuck the police. Charming. Arthur, we need to discuss where you were last night. We're gonna have to have a conversation. Welcome to my home, sir. Anyone thinking of donating to the city, well, is a friend of mine. Ah, yeah. Yeah, that was just a lie so I was able to get an appointment with you on shorter notice. I'm not even a constituent. And I definitely wouldn't vote for you. But I do have this. Los Angeles. You're out of your jurisdiction. And you're wasting my time. And you're letting a madman blow up banks. So I guess you and I have a lot to talk about. Man, I wish I had a seat at your weekly poker game, because you lie for shit. Now, why did you miss your appointment at the bank the day that it was blowing up? Midtown traffic. What was the appointment for? Hmm? What, you need a loan? I was, uh, looking to close out my safety deposit box. And Ricky Conlan beat you to it. Hmm. What was in it? Nothing of importance. Come on. No blood diamonds? No photos of you in a little white robe with a little pointy hat? No. Come on. What does Conlan have on you, huh? Video of you fucking the maid? Arthur? Again, please. Really sweet kid. Well, I need to prepare for my press conference. Of course. You gotta rehearse all that bullshit. Thank you for your service, Officer. Actually, that's "Detective." I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. Oh, don't be sorry. No, you were a great deal of help. After you. Oh, you know what? No, ah, there's just, um-- I just have one more thing. Mm-hmm. Do you still have safety deposit boxes? Now, why would you want to know that? Ah, just after Conlan's heist, where did you move them to? I consolidated them into one location. And where would that be? An impenetrable bank. Few know the actual location. Consider it a Fort Knox for the 1%. Ah. Well, Mr. Mayor, I think that you and I are gonna be seeing a lot of each other. I look forward to it. Good. Oh, and, uh, what's your wrist size, Mr. Mayor? I'd love to send you a nice little fuzzy pair of handcuffs for Christmas. You can keep the itinerary. Blow me. What the-- How'd you get in here? Well, that's between me and the door. Get out from behind my desk. I asked you a ques-- Oh. You're in a wheelchair. Bullets didn't hit my spine, so if I stay off my feet, I'll be up and running by Memorial Day. How the hell did you get in here? Yeah, well, you're a detective. You figure it out. You flew all the way from LA to New York to bust into my office? Oh, and I might as well tell you now, because you will find out. I paid a visit to the mayor. Man, I can't believe... ...he's such a bad liar. He's made it so far in politics. Now he's messaging me, asking me why some LA cop is asking him questions. Because he's involved. This could be the biggest scandal in the history of the city. I know Conlan's got something on the mayor. Let's just hope if Knight finds out what it is, he'll do the right thing. Yeah, Knight will play by the book. I have a feeling his definition of "by the book" is to beat a guy to death with a book. Find anything on Conlan? No. He wants to rid the world of money, yet he is playing Santa Claus. He does one thing, says another. I think that he wants the world to believe he's an animal. So find out who's holding the leash. Yes, ma'am. The first question is, where is my partner? You're a detective. Figure it out. Thank you all for coming. I am putting Ricky Conlan on notice. We will apprehend you. I am also putting the police department and Captain Anna Shea on notice. I will come after you if you fail in your directive. Ho! Ho! Ricky Conlan is not some sort of Robin Hood. Get down! Merry fucking Christmas! Eyes on the ground. You understand the problem? You wanna see my face? Look at me, motherfucker! Don't move! I want my present! He's a criminal of the lowest kind. I am here to save you! Look at this god you worship. Stand up. This is not Christmas! You wanna worship money your whole life? You see how well it spends when you're in hell. Wait, no. I have a family. Let's go. I urge you not to buy into his call to arms, and see it as nothing but a smoke screen to hide his criminal activity. He is recruiting ex-convicts. He is attempting to brainwash them... Merry Christmas. ...so they can join his cause. If there is anyone found aiding Ricky Conlan, you will feel the full force of this city brought to bear upon your heads. Now, if you have any questions, ask Captain Anna Shea and see what answers she gives you. Thank you. Motherfucker! You wanna sell us out? Sell out a great man like Conlan? I heard you call your ball and chain, motherfucker. The fuck is wrong with you? Oh, it's a long list, brother. He could have done for you what he did for me. He took me from the streets and gave me purpose, made me real. Disappointment is a hell of a thing. Do unto others... ...as you would have them do unto you. You wanted them to shoot me down like a dog. No. Why did you try to cut a deal? Come on, you were gonna burn my ass to save yours, weren't you? No, no, no. That's not what-- -Don't you lie to me. -Okay. Yeah, okay. I may be a liar, but I'm not fucking crazy. Well, in a society like this, being crazy could be a beautiful thing. You know? So let me ask you one more time. Did you try to cut a deal - with the New York pig department? - F-- All I'm asking for is the truth. All I want, just the truth, son. Just fucking kill me, man. Let's get it over with. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You don't understand. You don't under-- This is not your fault. No, no. Th-- This is part of the great deception of the liars. They used you just like they used me. Don't you see? They distracted us with all the-- the splendor, and the gold, and the-- and the-- and the-- and the pageantry and the theatrics. Right? "You're doing such a good job, son. Well done servicing your country." Right? Patriotism, xenophobia. This jingoism they filled in our heads, and they walked us out there. And they gave you-- They gave you a pigskin. And they said, "You carry it from one end of the battlefield to the other." And they handed me a rifle, and they taught me how to kill. He knows things, man. He's a truth teller. Hey, fuck you. No, no, don't be angry at him. Come on. You're angry at the system that left you deserted on the shores of poverty and dissolution without a cause to believe in. But I've got that fixed. 'Cause you and I are the same. We're both from the same society. We didn't do anything wrong here. We're not criminals. We're protagonists in our own story. Sure, man. Yeah. I get it, that makes sense. That makes sense, sure. I want the truth. I want the truth. Your faith isn't strong enough to get you to the next chapter, my son. I got to make you make a choice. I really hate doing this, but I have to show you something. It's good. It's kind of bad. But one day, I promise, you're gonna thank me for it. No. No, no, no! Fuck you! No! No, no, I tried-- I tried to fuck you, okay? I'm a piece of shit, okay? I'm-- I'm a drug addict. Just let them go. Fuck you! Let them go! Fuck you! Let them go! Shh. There you go. There you go. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Okay, okay, okay. That's the spirit. But you shoot me, they all die. Okay? You shoot yourself, they all die. Okay, you have to make a choice now. You have to make a choice so you can be free. What's the choice? Bring him in. What? Now make a decision and set yourself free. Ah, fuck. Oh, it's your brother. He wasn't part of this. This is me. This is the choice that gives you your freedom. - I alerted the cops. - Your family or your brother? Okay, we already know what you're gonna choose. Right? Look what he's done to you. He brought you to the bookie that you had to kill. He-- He got you to-- to rob banks. He taught you how to shoot a gun. That's the guy. Hurry it up. We got a world to save. Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Him or your family. One has to die. Come on, Casey. You've already made your fucking decision. Come on. Just do it. I'm sorry, man. Fuck, I'm sorry, brother. No, no. -I'm so sorry. -No, no, no, no, no, no! Fuck. I'm sorry, but I had to see. Well, fuck you, man. You sick fuck. You actually pulled the trigger? I had to know for sure. You are a true believer. I knew you had it in you. I am so goddamn proud of you. Oh, Casey. My man. What's wrong with you fucking people? Look, I woke up this morning and I thought, my God, I have everything I need in my life except one thing. Yeah, what's that? Your fucking sanity? You. Oh, fuck. When was the last time you slept? I caught an hour in the break room. We get any word from Knight? He's probably halfway to Argentina by now. Nah, he wouldn't run from a fight. Nah, you wanna think the worst of him, but he'll be there when the time comes. No. You know, just because you don't want something to happen doesn't mean it won't. I'm a single mother, Fitz. I'm well aware of making plans and having God interfere. Seeing as how you're already pissed off and messing around in my city without authority... What? Casey Rhodes. What about him? He busted out with Conlan during the jailbreak. Called his wife. She cut a deal with us. You cut a deal with the man who put me in this fucking chair? I want my city to be safe. It's a means to an end. You find anything on Conlan? The guy's talking like he's about to pull off the biggest heist in history. Look, I've been doing some research on potential targets. Okay? And right now, the record is the Cali truck job in '97. The take was over 30 mil. Mm-mmm. Biggest heist was in '75. Eight guys hit a secret bank owned by the mob. A secret bank? Conlan may be crazy, but he knows better than to mess with the families. Yeah. Look, get some rest. Knight will be back at some point. Yeah. Speak of the devil. They wanna put me on desk duty. Can you believe that? Probably for the best. Excuse me? Why, do you think if a guy runs up a flight of stairs, I can't catch him? Oh, you're just full of Christmas spirit, aren't you, huh? You old bastard. See, the games have changed, my brother. There's no more rules. There's no more codes. The game has changed. Yeah, Conlan isn't human. Look, the captain spoke to the mayor. I spoke to the mayor. He-- He had this itinerary on his desk. Some kind of meeting set up at, I don't know, Wooddrake Antiques or something. Can you believe that shit? That guy is out shopping while his city is under siege from a madman. You wanna hear something else crazy? Rhodes is cutting a deal with the captain. And the DA is gonna go for it. Desperate times. Christ, if I get my fucking hands on Rhodes, I'm gonna put my gun up his ass, pull the trigger. Jesus Christ. You can't stop thinking about him, can you? Just forget about this and come back to LA. They have zero physical evidence to lock you up. Your daughter misses you. Christ, I miss you. Do you know how much shit Macey is giving me for even being here? I'll be lucky if I'm not divorced before New Year's. I am who I am. Okay, fine. You know what? Don't listen to me. But Conlan isn't like any other criminal. Don't let Conlan get to you like Winna. You'll never come back. Well, you're wrong. No, I'm your friend. You've saved my life more times than I've had hot meals, and I feel like it's time for me to repay the debt. Well, if Conlan kills me, then so be it. Knight, I... And you know what? Fuck you for making me all sentimental. Just come home. Don't-- Don't turn into a monster by chasing a monster. Okay? That's all I ask. Just say grace and I'll be there soon. Don't be so dramatic. The kids aren't gonna care that I missed dinner when they see the presents I got them. Ho. Okay. Jerome, drive. Oh, shit. Conlan said I would be spared. -He looked me right in the eye-- -Really? 'Cause he told me to eat the rich. Wondering if he was meaning that literally. I told Conlan where every bank in this city was consolidating its valuables. We made a deal. Mmm. Well, he sent me to renegotiate. Have you seen my son? Where's my son? Have you seen... Boy, get your ass over here. Gonna miss my TED Talk. Now, I know Conlan is a mad son of a bitch. But all the great ones are. That man has shown me the truth. Every one of us has been abused, used by the system. They have taken our time, our life. They have put us in cages for crimes that the 1% commit every day. This city belongs to us. It is ours. And it always has been ours! And now it's time to make everybody see the light. The plan is simple. Thanks to our new brother here, the mayor will let us in. And we'll take it from there. No prisoners, no survivors. Some of you won't make it out. But upon your fallen bodies, we will build the foundation of this great movement. One day, many years from now when you're old, lying in your deathbed, you'll look up at your loved ones and one moment will flash before your memory. This day. This moment of greatness. You're my brothers, and I'm proud of you. Hey. You came to me, remember? You said your father held you down. He put his foot on you and pushed you to the ground, so he could rise up. And now what? Now you're alone? No, you're one of us. You're part of our family. You're in a real family now. I'm proud of you. You made the right choice. 'Cause we will always be there for you. Treat him the way you treat each other. He's one of us now. You got this. You're with us now. And you will do exactly as we say. You speak when I tell you. You jump when I tell you. You shoot when I tell you. Now get dressed, bitch. ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ ♪ And all is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon virgin Mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant So tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ Shepherds quake ♪ ♪ At the sight ♪ ♪ Radiant dreams From thy holy face ♪ Brother Knight. I hear you've been chasing me. What's the matter? Why haven't you caught me yet? You growing old? Slowing down? Yeah. Traffic. Traffic, oh! Liar. God, how I hate liars. This city is full of liars, hypocrites and thieves. Rhodes? Oh, yeah. He sees the big picture. The great liberation. He's a part of it now. I'm like the North Star, guiding the way through this cold Christmas night. And he's riding alongside of me like Pegasus. And all he wants-- All he wants is to be with his family. He's becoming one of us. He's like Saul when he became Paul. Evolving into something bigger and better. I'm so proud. I never said he was smart. I miss you, James. I do. I miss us. Oh, we would have been great together. It's too bad. There are no more cowboy cops, and they've killed all our heroes. It's just us. You think I'm just robbing banks and blowing up banks? So much more than that. You don't see the big picture. Christmas is about togetherness. It's not all this material shit. Who cares? Toys and gadgets, they don't mean anything. Hope. Hope is all that matters. And hope is a dangerous thing. One last time, James. Join me. Got any booze? Yeah. The mayor just told me where he's keeping the good stuff. After tonight, I'm gonna stay drunk until Valentine's Day. It's gonna be like Fort Knox for alcoholics over here. Join me. Last chance before I change the world. This only ends when one of us is dead. If you insist. Let's move! Brother Knight, change takes sacrifice. The mayor just told me where he's keeping the good stuff. Some kind of meeting set up at, I don't know, Wooddrake Antiques or something. All right, chow's up. Thank you for being here on Christmas Day. Well, it's nice to know you remembered my number. I know where he's gonna hit. Wooddrake Antiques. It's a front for the 1%. He wasn't robbing banks. He was creating fear. He made everyone put their valuables in one place. There's no reason to rob a hundred banks when you can just, you know, rob one. Well, that's some damn fine work, Detective. Don't move. Let me tell Shea. You can't catch Conlan alone. He's got nothing to lose. If I can save just one person, it's worth it. That's what I do. Hey, Knight, don't go in there alone. Kni-- Knight! Shit. I'm sorry. He has my son. They brainwashed my son. He came willingly. You broke your promise, Conlan. Listen to the politician give us lectures on broken promises. The only promise I made was to the Almighty himself. I promised him to keep heaven full of fresh souls. So Rhodes here better be enthusiastic in his support, or his beautiful wife, Lily, and that sweet daughter, Clara, are never gonna wake up to open their presents on-- Please, Conlan. We had a deal. I can give you anything you want. I can give you the keys to the city. The keys to the city? Really? You can give me the keys to the city? I don't need the keys to the city when I have the keeper of the keys right here in my van. Not like this. This is too far. You're gonna set the city back 50 years. No, no, no, my brother. I'm going to propel the city into the future. We're gonna expose the dark secrets of the elite. So lock and load, brothers. We got a job to do. Smile, Mayor. It's Christmas. Let the games begin. Gonna deck the halls with blood, motherfuckers. Let's go. The other guys are in position. I need to make a withdrawal. How's it going? Hi. You can come in now. Uh-uh, don't you move. Let them have everything! Just give them what they want! We don't have to be given anything. We're gonna take everything. Let's get this party started. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Jingle on this, bitches. Please, don't shoot. I'm just the lookout. It was never supposed to be like this. Conlan said we were starting a revolution. How many in there? Ten, 15. I don't know. But they're all cons. Hard-core. I just wanted to be tough. I bet you're tough now. Fuck off. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho. Don't move. Move it. Stay frosty, Santas. Open the vault. Move! Oh. Merry Christmas, my brothers. Time to reap the rewards of your loyalty. All this just to steal some shit? No. This is about rebooting the system. Oh, bullshit. Bullshit, man. You're nothing but a thief. No. I'm no thief. I'm just a man who played the system that made me. Shit. Part of you believes in this mission. I can see it in your eyes right there. Look at this. Look at these riches. We can overthrow governments with this. We can bring about the great liberation. This is the beginning of the unbreaking of humanity. My father taught me to fix what's broken. Your father was a cuck. With the deep state's balls... ...tickling his tonsils. My father taught me that if you can't change the world, bring it to its knees. We are so close. So close. Don't you understand? They killed my son with their fake wars. I will end them before they do that to your child. I'm doing this for you. Help me, I beg you. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Christmas is about togetherness. I need you. I need you to help these men bring out that loot. Do that, and I swear on the baby in the manger, I will let your family go. We're out of here in four minutes, Santas. You did good. Stupid-ass elites think they can hide their pearls in a closed-down bank. Yeah, this shit got to be at least nine figures once it's fenced. Money is just a way of keeping score. We'll redistribute the wealth of the world. We did it, Dajon. Okay, I'm done. You're done when I say you're done. No, no, no, no. I helped you get your little fucking war chest thing, okay-- This is not a negotiation. I'm fucking done. Get your fucking hands off me. I have your wife. I have your daughter. You're one of us now. Act like it. Hey! Who are you? What the-- Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck is that? Is that a grenade? Fuck, fuck, fuck! Where did it go? Where did it go? Hurry the fuck up. He's here. Come on, go! Come on, go! The fuck is all that? Fuck is all that? You tip 'em off? He's here. Where are you hiding, Detective? I can smell you. Fear everywhere, buddy. You handsome bald devil, come out and play. Ho, ho, ho. Hello, Detective. Nothing better to do on Christmas Eve? This is as good as it gets for me. Well, with friends like us, who needs family? Am I right? This is how it's gonna go. I'll tell you how. I'm gonna shove a Christmas tree up your ass... ...and set it on fire. A Christmas tree up my ass? All the way. Okay, okay. You're even kinkier than I thought, Detective. But I like that. No foreplay, okay? You're gonna make sure we walk out of here free and clear. Why? Because you have a gun to his head? The fuck do I care? Shoot him. What? You shot my partner. See what I'm dealing with here? He sold you up the river, Rhodes. You mean nothing to him. Less than nothing. Less than nothing. Wow. You're cold, Detective. Wow. Dajon, you forgot to get me a Christmas present. I would like this motherfucker's head in my stocking, please. Would someone just kill him? Where is your Christmas spirit, Detective Knight? Dajon, quit fucking around. You let that pretty boy kick your ass? I trained you better than that, you little pussy. I'm coming, boss! Fuck. Uh-oh. Sounds like Santa Claus didn't give you enough ammunition for this party. Don't you worry. Father Conlan has more than enough bullets to share with you. You were right again, Knight. This only ends with one of us dead. Merry Christmas, motherfucker. How you doing, brother? You f-- Oh. Wow. Didn't see that coming. Are we good? I mean, not, you know, good good. But good enough? I'm gonna give you five seconds before I lube up my gun. What the fuck does that mean? Well, I guess you're gonna find out in four. One. Two. Three. It's gonna be okay. Mom! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's gonna be okay. It's okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Arthur! Arthur, where are you? Freeze! NYPD! Put it down! Hands where we can see them. I'm looking for my son. Arthur Vassetti. Please, help me find my son. Where is my son? My son's name is Arthur Vassetti. Ricky Conlan took my son! Did Conlan meet your son at church? Where's my son, Arthur? How long were you working for Conlan? Lock him up! Lock him up! Ricky Conlan has my son. Find my son! You're the gift that keeps on giving. You win. Don't let them put me in a cage. I'm not going back. Kill me. Do it. Merry Christmas, motherfucker. Ho! The State calls to the stand Detective Fitzgerald. Good to see you on your feet again, Fitz. Anything to make you happy, Mason. How about you save us all a bunch of time and tell us the real truth about your partner? Oh, where do I begin? Knight was cleared for the extraordinary events in New York City and the prosecutor lacks the evidence he needs to charge him for the murder of one Jerry Leach which, ipso facto, does not make that guy innocent. Ipso facto? Who gives a fuck? No one's crying for Jerry Leach. The man was a convicted murderer who got off on a technicality. If Knight killed him, it was only to stop him before he hurt someone else. Detective, is the world a safer place with Knight behind bars or behind a badge? Honestly, where do I begin? He's moody, disorganized, he drives fast, talks shit all day. He's a workaholic. I once caught him teaching my eldest son to do e-brake turns in a parking lot. Okay, my son Sam is nine. Nine years old. And he didn't think that he was doing anything wrong. He has yet to pick up a check, not once in the eight years that we've been partners. Let's just say this guy is an asshole. But it's not his job to be liked. This man has more experience than the rest of the guys in the department combined. He's the first man on the scene. He's the first man through the door. This guy is a cop. And we are all much safer with James Knight behind the badge. After hearing two dozen testimonies assessing victim impact statements and his past cases, the department recommends that James Knight be reinstated effective immediately. Congratulations, Detective.
