You can't screw up again. I'm trying to help you, Ray. I really am. They're good people. Your, uh, Aunt Sherry and cousin Kim. Real family. Embrace it. [Soft piano music] Come in. Hi. Sherry? I'm Ernie Williams. Hi, how are you, Kim. Ray? [Dramatic piano music] It's really good. Oh, I'm glad I got the family size. [Chuckles] Mom never cooks. Hey, hey, that's not true. [Scoffs] I've made some stuff. This must be really hard. How many other homes were there? Kim. What? No, that's fine. Eight, nine, including here. I never really knew her, your mom. [School bell rings] Yo, Mike. Sit next to me in physics, I didn't study? [Chuckles] Hey, man. What's up, brother? - How you doing? - Extraordinary. - And you? - I'm alright, man. - [Kim] Hey. - [All] Hey. How are you? - [Vic] Wow, let me get one. - [Kim] So cute. - [Kim] Stop. - [Vic laughs] - [Eric] What's up? - Ray, this is Eric, my boyfriend. - Zoe. Vic. - [Vic] Yo. - [Kim chuckles] - [Vic] You guys look nothing alike. - [Zoe] Not at all. - [Vic] Not a little bit. What's up, Ray? [School bell rings] - [Zoe] Hey, got to go. - [Vic] Alright. - See you. - [Vic] Let me grab my bag. - What? - Got something. - What? - I made this for you. You made this? Well, yeah, yeah. I mean, it's nothing crazy. You like? I love it. Thank you. How about thanking me in private? Eric. Kim. - [Scoffs] - What? I told you, I don't want my first time to be a quickie during lunch break. Well, then don't put words in my mouth 'cause that's not what I said. Let's just talk about this later. Yeah. [Kim sighs] Let's go. [Vic sighs] Still ain't knock it out of the park? Shut up, they're right there. Goddamn it, no, I haven't. I feel like this fucking Ray thing is not going to help. Definitely not. They really don't look related. Told you. [Dwyer] Nature versus nurture. Was Richard Ramirez born a killer? Or, was he exposed to violence at an early age and that turned him into the Night Stalker? I mean, a lot of people suffer tragedy in their lives, but they don't go on killing sprees. So... was there something in Mr. Ramirez's DNA that made it so easy for him to kill. I mean, we're not alone. All animals kill. But humans, humans have the ability to check their animal instincts... most of the time. Now, back to Mr. Ramirez. If he were an animal... what would he be? Anyone? Come on. [Eerie music] Great white? [Dwyer] Hmm. And why would a great white be like a serial killer? Well, uh, they're solitary predators. They don't travel in packs or anything. And they don't just hunt for food. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Correct. Way to go, Ray. Class, this man comes in on his first day, participates. Got a lot of catching up to do. [Soft dramatic music] [Sherry] So, what are you planning to do tonight? [Kim] Just a couple of us are going to get together - and hang out. - Mm-hmm. - [Kim] Nothing big. - Okay. - [Kim] Why are you asking me? - Well, I was just wondering if you were thinking of inviting Ray, bringing him along. [Kim] I don't think that's a good idea, Mom. [Sherry] Well, he needs to make some friends. [Kim] Yeah, but, Mom, I don't think he'd get along with my friends very well. You could introduce him, maybe he could make some friends and then he wouldn't seem like a problem. - [Eric sighs] - [Zoe] Wow, first time you didn't crash. - [Eric] Oh, God, Zoe. - [Vic] Can you shut that please? Thanks. [Eric] You got to relax on me. Hey, Vic, will you check for some hot Cheetos, man? - [Vic] Yeah. - I got, like, a craving. - [Vic] Okay. - Hey, Ray. Go up to the counter, ask for Lucky Duck scratch tickets, okay? - What? - Lucky Duck scratch ticket. It's a, it's a lottery thing. [Bell dings] [ominous music] Sorry. [Group chatter] [Eric] Seen any Cheetos, man? [Vic] Nah, no Cheetos. [Kim] You know what's really good, though? This stuff. - Pineapple juice. - Tastes good. Right? - Yes. - I know, it tastes so good. - So does this. It's, uh, kid approved. - No, no, no. Hey, don't do anything stupid. You think I'm going to do something? - Yes. - This girl, who do you think you're dating? [Kim] You always do something stupid. I'm totally going to do something stupid. [Chuckles] Hey, Ray. Ray, Ray, Ray. Hey, man. Lucky Duck, man, come on. - Yo, Cheetos? - [Vic] No, no Cheetos. Damn, that's weird, man. What kind of liquor store doesn't have Cheetos? But, um, Ray wanted to check on some scratch off tickets or something, so I'll hang with him, meet you in the car, yeah? - Yeah, cool. - Cool, man. Alright, see you in a sec. Hey, do you have, uh, any Lucky Ducks? - Um, Lucky Duck? - Scratch-offs. We've got, uh, Big Spender, Gold Rush, Triple Play. - No Lucky Ducks, sorry. - Oh, what a shame, whatever. We'll get them somewhere else. It's just, that's the only thing my mom plays, so. - Check it out. Check it out. - [Clerk] Hey. Hey! Fuck me! Hey, have fun, Ray. You little piece of shit-- - [fist thuds] - [clerk] Whoa! [Clerk clatters] [intense music] - [bell dings] - Ray. Oh, my God. Wait, is he okay? Yeah, he'll be fine. We should go though. - Jesus. - [Ray sighs] Wait, you got some? [Scoffs] Yeah. You waited for me? You're family. I wouldn't leave you there alone. - [Vic] Okay. - [Zoe] Okay. - So, go up, up there. - [Eric] Uh-huh. Zoe, do you want to just fucking play? Yeah, I actually do, but since you two have the remotes-- Then cut the backseat driving. Come on, let's go. Okay, let me get the sniper first. - Oh! You made it. - Now we're on opposing-- [Kim] Yeah, thanks. No problem. Oh, way to go, Ray. [Vic] Oh, Ray got that ass. [Kim] The only thing Eric ever got was a bag of chips, huh. [Vic] He got a lighter once. Don't forget that lighter. [Zoe] Yeah, at least you got out. Not like when he... [eerie music] [muffled voices] It's really funny, isn't it, Ray? [Kim] We're just kidding, Eric, Jesus. [Chuckles] [Vic] Yeah, man, lighten up. - Here. - [Chuckles] Alright. So. [School bell rings] Hey, Ray, you got a second? Sure. Shelters, foster homes, physical abuse. No kid deserves your childhood. I'm fine. These kids... they know I love them. But as you can tell, they're basically a bunch of slobs. [Laughs] I can use a hand cleaning up a couple days after school. I mean, it doesn't pay much, but there's always pretty good snacks in the staff room. Yeah, okay. Great. Just come by Wednesday, last period's all football players. It's a disaster area. Is that it? That's it. [Flushes] - [fist thuds] - [dramatic music] [Ray coughs] [Ray pants] What actually happens, if you get into trouble, what do they do to you? You want to hit me? You do. Come on, Ray, come on, fucking hit me. What did I ever do to you? You didn't do fucking anything. [Slaps] You're just a fucking pussy. [Dramatic musical sting] [eerie music] [knocks on door] Hello? Uh... I'm from the liquor store the other night. Found your wallet? [Whimsical music] I just saw the room key. [Sighs] Antiques. I collect antiques. Thanks for the other night. Hmm. I hope you fucked him up good, whoever he is. You met him that night. Your friend? Who set you up? He's not my friend. Look, man, people only push you as far as you fucking let them. What, you scared? I just can't get in trouble again. Then we make sure you don't get caught. Sound good? Alright, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

[Soft whimsical music] Cigarette burns. Hmm. What are you doing? Shh. Jimmy Mahoney hit me with a hammer in shop class. Little fucker. This was a, uh, recent business transaction that, um... got a little heated. This was the first time my daddy whipped me with an antenna. That shit hurt. [Shepard sighs] What happened there? - This one? - Mm-hmm. Crashed my bike into a fence. [Laughs] What? You got to come up with a better story than that, man. My foster dad locked me in the basement for a week after that. It got infected. - Better? - Hmm. [Shepard] Hmm... [sighs] You feel powerless... because people you trusted took your power away. Hmm. Time to take it back. [Suspenseful music] [crickets chirp] [car trunk clicks] [car trunk locks] [car beeps] [car beeps] [eerie music] Fuck! Ray. Out of the way. - [Kim] Eric. - No, no, no. - Relax. - He broke my fucking car. Don't tell me to relax, Ray. I'm going to fucking kill you! Eric, stop it! You break my car? - I'll break your knees for you, fat boy. - [Dwyer] Hey, stop it! Hey, stop. Eric. Stop it. - He broke my fucking car. - Look, I don't care. Ray, you okay? - Yeah, he's fine. - Look, you guys go back to class. Now. Now! - [Eric] Wipe that fucking look off your face. - [Vic] Come on, E. Get out of here. Go! [Eric chuckles] I'm going to fucking kill you. [Laughs] I'm going to fucking kill you. Sure you're okay? - [Suspenseful music] - [Eric grunts] - [thuds] - [Ray grunts] [Ray shrieks] [car revs] [Eric grunts] Oh, Ray. [Grunts] [Vic] Oh, Ray, you shouldn't have. - [Thuds] - [Ray grunts] - [Eric] Get him up. - [Ray grunts] - It's okay. It's okay. - Hey, buddy. [Vic] We're just getting started. [Eric grunts] Up. [Vic] There we go, Ray. I know you got one more in you. I know you do. - There you go. - [Eric pants] [Vic] There you go. You ready? - [Fist thumps] - [Eric shouts] [dramatic music] - [Ray pants] - [Vic spits] First day of the rest of your life, Ray. See you tomorrow, man. [Chuckles] [Ray chokes] [Sherry] This is unreal. Who did this to you? [Ray] I don't know. [Sherry] Kim? [Kim] Why would I know? Well, you must've heard something. Must have someone see something? Give me the first-aid kit. Could've been anyone. I'm going to march into the Principal's office and I'm going to demand a-- No, please don't do that. It's not going to do anything. - Then the police. - [Ray] That's worse. Look in a mirror, I don't think that's possible. He's right, Mom. We have to do something. [Light suspenseful music] [knocks on door] [Shepard chuckles] What the fuck happened to you? Come on in. No one saw you? No. [Ray sighs] - [Ray grunts] - Relax. [Ray grunts] Now there we go. What are you going to do about this, huh? Nothing ain't an option, Ray. I'll get sent away. Then why are you here? I don't know. - Make a habit of visiting strangers' hotel rooms? - No. - Hmm? Then why are you here? - I said I don't know. You think we're just going to have milk and cookies and talk about girls, huh? I need help, okay! [Soft whimsical music] I just want it to stop. You just want it to stop. You're too focused on getting caught, Ray-Ray. Don't worry about that shit, alright? There are ways, baby. There are ways. [Sighs] Alright. So, you're in school. What does every school have? Pencils. Okay? Sharpen up a pencil real good, walk up behind him, bam, stab him right in the temple and keep on walking. Okay? He takes gym right? - Right? - Yeah. Find out when his gym class is, when he's taking a shower, get behind him, ram his head into the wall. He'll fall down, hit his head on the tile, boom. You tell people he slipped. I can't do either of those things. Hey! You got one fucking option now. Fight back. You can always go old school on his ass. Hey. You can look at it, I didn't say you can touch it. You can touch it. Kidding. You can touch it. Touch it. Go ahead. Just remember, it ain't yours. Alright. Seriously, though, Ray-Ray, we got this. You're golden. Want a slice of pizzie? Huh? Pizzie? Pizza. Sure. Don't eat it all too fast. [Knocks on door] Sorry. No, it's, it's cool. [Sniffles] I broke up with Eric. The way he's treated you, Ray. I'm so sorry. He's not the same person anymore. [Sighs] [light suspenseful music] [lawnmower buzzes] Violence is a waste of energy and solves nothing. Why don't you tell that to Eric? You know, people only push you as far as you let them. That's true. But it doesn't mean you have to turn to violence. I'm not turning to violence. Then tell someone. You don't have to be a victim. If you say so. Ray, look at me. There's a line that society has tattooed collectively on our brains. A line that we can't step over. And if you think violence is the only action, you're wrong. Restraint is an action. Compassion is an action. Now, if anyone is bothering you or you want to talk about anything... [paper rips] ...give me a call. We'll deal with it. Together. I got to go. [Eerie music] [eerie piano music] [crickets chirp] [light clicks] [eerie music] I need your help. [Crickets chirp] [music intensifies] [Ray vomits] Let's go. - [Car doors close] - [car engine starts] Why'd you do it? 'Cause it needed doing. I was taking care of it. Bullshit. Eric's an asshole but he didn't deserve to get-- I'm not going to explain myself to you, Ray. You can't just kill people. It's easier than you think. This is what I'm talking about. You're not up for the task. Eric knew it. He fucking smelled it. You think he'd ever be scared of you, huh? Nope. I can never do that. You asked for help. Frankly, I was expecting a little fucking gratitude. [Crows caw] [Ray grunts] [Ray pants] I need a sec. [Soft whimsical music] - Get busy. - Here? How many bodies have you buried? That's what I thought. Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig. [Can clicks] Put some back into it. [Shovels thuds] There you go. Use your foot too. There we go. I saw a girl. What? I saw a girl, in front of your house. - She's not going to say anything. - Mm. That depends. On what? Well, we need a good story for why you got in my car in the middle of the night. You're my driving instructor. Okay, sounds retarded. [Ray pants] Landscaping. Worse. What? Like, landscaping plants at night? Come on. Think, Ray. Use that brain of yours. [Shovel thuds] Delivering packages. They have to go out by tomorrow and you're behind. Couldn't do them during the day. As much as I can't stand you right now, I actually like that. We're going to have to take him somewhere else.

[Ray] Yeah, I, uh, been working with him after school. Making a little extra spending cash. [Williams] Oh, how's the move going? [Ray] It's good. [Williams] You okay, Ray? Yeah. If there's something wrong, you can tell me. Everything's good. Honestly. It's nice to see you taking your work so seriously. Just trying to embrace it. What did you talk about? [Light suspenseful music] Nothing. [Chuckles] Come. Nothing, huh? You were in there for 45 minutes. What did you talk about, Ray-Ray? Classes I like. Oh. Hmm. I didn't tell him anything. I swear. I stuck my neck out for you. I'd hate to regret it. [Chuckles] [sighs loudly] Good boy. [Meat slices] [suspenseful music] [chews loudly] [meat slicing loudly] [slicing intensifies] [music intensifies] [dramatic musical sting] [huffs loudly] [knocks on door] Feeling better? Yeah, I'm fine. Can I come in? Just wanted to see if you're okay. Yeah, sorry about that. [Chuckles] Please. We've been waiting for someone to barf on the table for a while. Thought you'd be the one. I'll try again tomorrow. [Chuckles] You know... I've been thinking about me and Eric and... you. Can't imagine what you've been through, Ray. Everybody's got their own shit. Yeah, but your pile is way higher than anyone else I know. [Chuckles] You know, you got the good mattress. [Chuckles] It's a lot better than the cardboard box I slept on last year. Really? - No. [Laughs] - [chuckles] I slept on a very nice bunk bed with a six-year-old. You can say no, but can I sleep here tonight? I don't know if your mom would like that. Please... she won't know. I just-- I really don't want to be alone right now. Sure. [Light suspenseful music] A couple nights ago... whose car was that? I saw you get in the car with some guy. Just a friend. You think I'll ever see Eric again? I don't know. [Suspenseful music] [fists thud] [sighs] [exhales] Fuck. [Fists bang loudly] I can't fucking do it. [Exhales] [grumbles] [exhales] [bell rings] Hey, what did you do to him? Huh? Where's E? I know he wouldn't pull no pussy shit and I know you did something and I know you do. I know you know. Tell me. [Eerie music] - Tell me. - Vic. Vic, don't get expelled! Stop! - No! I know you know! - Stop it! I know you know. Tell me! - Tell me where he is! - Stop it! - Tell me! - Let's go. I know you know! Come on, go. Ray, you okay? Seems like you've been... somewhere else lately. I mean, in class you're barely paying attention. I'm good. - Trouble at home? - Jesus, I said I'm fine, okay? Relax. [Ray sighs] What's going on? I don't know what to do. [Sighs] Take a deep breath, calm down, and let me help you. You can't. No one can. [Light eerie music] Tell me how I can help you. Have you been, uh, talking to anyone lately? Your social worker? I can't risk that. Risk what? You don't understand. Then help me understand. I met someone. Oh. [Chuckles] Look, I, [chuckles] look, I know what you mean. Man, there was this girl, Claire Baxter-- Just stop! Okay? Just shut up! Okay, I'm, I'm sorry. [Sobs] I just needed help. Then it got out of hand. [Sighs] There's this guy. Who? [Sighs] I got to go. [Shepard] Ray Gun! How was school? - It was fine. - Oh. Who's that? It's my biology teacher. Hmm. What's his name? Name? Mister Dwyer. Hmm. [Chuckles] Alright, what do you want to eat? Hmm, what do you want to eat? On me. [Car engine starts] I want... [car dings] ...Shakey's. - [Shepard] Hmm. - [Ray] I didn't tell him anything. I swear. You wanted to though, didn't you? Huh? [Chuckles] Ah. [Soft whimsical music] [sighs] Glad you didn't, Ray Gun. Hey... you don't do that to your partner. [Sighs] See... I don't usually interact with civilians, but I took an exception to you, because I like you and I actually looked forward to you stopping by. Me too. And I know that... keeping secrets is hard. I get it. [Slurps] But you, you, my friend, you don't got to worry about that. Want to know why? Because I... got your back. [Grunts] Something to help you remember that. I want you to really... look at it. See that fingerprint right there, huh? That's you. Hair right there? [Light suspenseful music] Relax, Ray-Ray. Relax. Ah! Ah! [Chuckles] We're good, hot stuff. Huh? Besides... I got to get out of town. What? Too bad, huh? I know. Could've gotten into a lot more trouble together. Where you going? [Sighs] Would you mind walking back from here? Sure. Alright. Ray... can I borrow your phone real quick? Why? I got to tie up a couple loose ends. It's always something, right? That it is. Your cousin and that teacher. [Suspenseful music] - [Shepard] Bye, Radio. - Hey! Hey! [Shepard] I'll see you at Dwyer's. [Wheels click] - [Dwyer] A little late for a house call, Mr. Williams. - [Shepard] Yes, I'm, I'm sorry, but, uh, I was worried about Ray, and, well, honestly, he, he speaks so highly of you, so. He's a special kid. I agree. - Have a seat. - Oh, thank you. This is, uh... quite a couch. Thanks. You know, I don't feel comfortable talking about a student unless it's in a professional setting. [Chuckles] I'm sensing some hostility here. No, I'm just playing it safe. Ah. - For Ray. - Sure, sure, for Ray. I get it. Well, he mentioned to me that you all have been spending a lot of time together. A lot of quality time. A lot of alone time, and, uh, I wanted to speak with you about that. You want something to drink? I would love a beer. Coming right up. [Eerie music] [crickets chirp] [bike clicks] [Ray] Mr. Dwyer! Mr. Dwyer!
