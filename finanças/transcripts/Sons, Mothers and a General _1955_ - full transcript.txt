CHILDREN, MOTHERS AND A GENERAL written by HERBERT REINECKER based on his novel "Quick" Featuring The mothers: HILDE KRAH L... The girl: BEATE KOEPNICK The children: The soldiers: and the general: EWALD BALSER Directed by: LASLO BENEDEK MARCH 1945 EAST OF STETTIN WHEELS ROLLING FOR VICTORY Isn't the train going onto Puritz? - No, this is it. Is another train going to Stettin? - I don't know. Nobody knows. There's a timetable. - Forget about it. What about PUritz? - Why go to PUritz? I've got 100 pairs of shoes there. Russians are wearing your shoes now. - My daughter! Helga! Where is my daughter? They blew the Oder River bridges. - Then how will we get away? Fast! Come on! - I don't know. How many times do I have to say it? I don't know. I can't stay here all night. - Excuse me. I don't know anything! Nothing at all! I don't know either! I need a doctor! A woman fainted! Afew shoes? It's mylivelihood! Listen to me! She's lying on the platform! Excuse me. Some information... - Damn it... What do you want? Lock the door. Yes, yes. It's returning to Stettin, but I don't know when. I just came from Stettin. I wanted to ask where the school is? What school? A Stettin boys' school. They evacuated it. Yes, I think I heard something. They brought them here. Tons of children. Just crazy. I want to pick up my son. Dear woman... - Mayl make a call? Try if you want. Maybe the operators have taken off as well. Do you know how many have left? Fast as they could, across the Oder River. - Is the front so close? No one knows how close it is. They don't tell us anything. Is the stationmaster in? - Yes, but it's locked! There's no such thing! - He won't open up. Making noise is always the best. Hello? - I'm not waiting till the Russians get here. No one is picking up. - Then they've lefi too. They can, they don't have to ask permission. I was going to retire in 6 months, and now this mess, this damn mess. What's going on? Why did you lock yourselves in? I just have a question. My dear woman, we know a little as you. - You don't even know the question! They're all nuts here. I just want to know where the school is. I'm also looking for the school. - You're picking up your boy too? - Yes. How do you like that? They evacuate for an air raid so, God forbid, they don't get hurt, and then they don't come back. - That's right. They're gonna get it! Elfriede Bergmann is my name. My husband's a locksmith in Stettin. I waited for the boys everyday, and I set off today. I've got two, Karl and Leo. Harald is my boy. Mrs. Asmussen. - A pleasure. Ladies, this is an office. Until the very last day, this is an office! - Keep your pants on about your office... We only want to pick up our boys. Like I said before, they're all nuts. Is nobody here to... Are you taking the tickets? Tickets? What good are tickets? You can stick them in your hat. It must be bad if a guy like that doesn't want your ticket anymore. FIRST TRIUMPH, THEN TRAVEL! This can't be the school. - Yes, I bet it is. They always put military nonsense in schools. Fast! Close it, would you? - What did I tell you? Now they're packing. Now they're coming. Now they're in a hurry. Hello, Dr. Brant. Good evening. Good evening, Mrs. Asmussen. Mrs... - Bergmann. Bergmann, yes. We're just packing. I can see that. Can you tell us why we had to come here to pick up our children? First we had no car, and then no gasoline, but now we can go, finally. Thank goodness. But where is my son? Watch out, gentlemen. Come with me. They packed the place full of ammunition and guns. God forbid, these are children in here! I... I have something to tell you. - What's wrong? Your boys are gone. What do you mean, gone? They went home, right? Are they at home? No. They're at the front. Yes. They wrote it in a note. I found it today but they were gone. 15 boys, a whole dormitory. My son Harald? - He's with them. I don't even need to ask if mine are with them, huh? They went too. - When somethings going on, they're there. They just can't stay out of mischief's way. I don't understand. At the front? Why would they want to go there? - Why go there? Don't you see? They want to shoot. They want to fight. To defend their fatherland, am I right? Yes. It's... What can I say? It's some kind offascination. Now that everything's going badly, they have to... It's something like heroism. That's what they think it is. Stop it with your heroism. You know what I call it? Stupidity is what I call it. Colleague? Can I leave with my class now? Please. The car is here. Please, go ahead. Ladies, your boys left some things here. Please come and pack them. - Okay. So, here are theirthings. Here come more of them. Are your boys gone too? Off to the front? Yes. A fine mess, eh? We just heard, too. Horrible. Sons are a punishment from God. If mine were here, I'd beat him. Here. That's the only thing I can find of his. It's his harmonica case. Please, we have to leave. I don't know whose this is... This is his sweater. He didn't even take his sweater. And the nights are so cold now. They don't think of those things. Their minds are elsewhere. WHAT DOESN'T KILL US ONLY MAKES US STRONGER I just don't understand how children could do this... YOU'RE NOTHING, YOUR NATION IS EVERYTHING As you can see, they can. Please ladies, pack up these things. The car is waiting, we have to leave. Back? I can't. But I can't go back without my boy. And you think I can? No. My boys won't get away from me that easily. I'm going to bring them back. It wouldn't be the first time. Bring them back? I'll come forthem. I'll get them. I've always gotten them. And if they're at the front? I'll bring them back, no matter where they are. Brilliant! - But that's... But that's impossible! - It's brilliant, but you couldn't understand that. Just drive with the children back to Stettin. I beg your pardon, I'm... - Oh! I'm bringing mine back too. Even ifhe's at the front. - Do you really think that... My God, do you think that'll be of any use? I'll do it. I'll do it at once! Well then, let's go. Who is in favor? All of us. Of course, we're all going. - What about you? I... I don't know. My mother is sick, but if I come back without Robert, that's even worse. If you'll take me? - Come on, we can do it. - Where are we going? Freight trains are still running. - But you can't just go to the front! How do you propose to do that? Hello, Doctor. When are you leaving? - Soon, Lieutenant. It's just that... The car has to be back here tomorrow. Go, go, go! Pardon me, ma'am... They're retrieving their boys from the front. - What? Tell them not to. - Where is the front? What? Somewhere near PUritz, but that's nonsense. You can't do that! Why are you laughing? - Orders, Lieutenant. They're going to Puritz. - What do you want there? We're going on holiday. I hear there's a nice lake with sailboats. The Russians are sailing them now. Come with us to Stettin. We've got everything. Radio, schnapps... Come on, there's no use asking them anymore questions. Have they lost their minds? - Yes, apparently. The blond one, I'd like to take her along. - Me too, she's drop dead glamorous. That wasn't my plan this morning. My husband will be surprised, when I don't come home. If mine knew what I was doing... He has a bad temper. My husband wouldn't understand either. He's a pastor. I'm sure he would think it was wrong. - What, are you afraid already? No. I just hope we can get our boys back. My boy's name is Edmund. He's 15. He's a good boy. My boy's name is Werner. He's tallerthan me, even though he'sjust 15. We always stuck together against my husband. He wants to study. I sew on the side, just so that he'll be able to study. He's going to be an engineer. - That's a good job. My husband says there's a future in it. My brother is also going to study. Robert is his name. He's only 14. My boy's name is Harald. - And my boy is Georg. Georg is his name. Can't you stop with the "My boy's name" stuff? They all have names. Forgive me. Were you dreaming? Yes. They're all sleeping and dreaming. You can tell by looking at them. And you? I can't sleep. I'm a doctor. I've had a lot of night shifts. I don't dream at all. Are you also suddenly afraid for your son? I dreamt of mine. You know... My husband fell in battle, a year ago. My son is all I have left. Can you understand that I'm afraid for him? We always had a very special relationship. I mean... especially affectionate. He is gentle, and musical... He's not at all the kind you could imagine in a war. No one is. Of course. I know how you are feeling. I've always known what is going on inside people. I'm certain you are very smart. I'm too ugly to be dumb. But you're not ugly. Oh, yes. I knowl am. I was suspicious, even as a child, because I was ugly. You're wonderful. Is your husband a doctor as well? I've never been married. What on earth are they thinking? That we're going for an Easter walk? They won't stop. He's going to take me with him, even if he has to run me over! What's wrong, Mama? - Listen, General, or whatever you are! Give us a lift. - To hell with the General. Where to? To the front. You're all drunk! Go! Go! He'staking us along! Get in, Mama. - Open the door. So, now you can say that we're crazy, too. I didn't say that. - What do you say? Nothing. Come on, Mama, Get that cork out of there. - You got it. Schnapps? Yes. A real nice brand. Want some, Mama? - No. You can drink that stuff alone. Someday you'll see that this stuffs good. Without schnapps, Mama, a war like this would be unbearable. Do you know what most of them would give to have their moms come? Have 'em run to the trenches, grab 'em by the cheek and haul 'em out? What a lot of guys wouldn't give for that! Me too, Mama. Damn it, me too! Come on Mama, pull out the cork. - My God, you must be really drunk already. In there. - Do we have to get out here? Yes. He said this is a... What was it again? A division command post, Mama. Yeah, that thing. We should ask. They have a general here. Think they know anything? - Can't hurt to ask. Don't be afraid, Mama. - Me? You don't know me too well. He's going to hear it from me! - Too bad I won't see his face. Thank you. What do you want? You can't go in, officers are in there. We know, boy. - We'd like to speak with the General. What do you want from the General? What's going on? - They're asking for the General, Major. How can I be if service? We're looking for our sons, Major. They left school to go to the front. And that is why we'd like to ask... - Please... Please come in. Learn a thing ortwo from him! Enter. Pardon me, General. Mayl have a moment, General? - What is it? - Excuse me, General, but it's about our children. - What children? I informed the General yesterday, as the General returned from the front. - Tell me again. What is this about? - Yesterday, 15 young people arrived here. Children, General. - Young people, between 15 and 16. 14! My brother is 14! - It doesn't matter. No, it does matter. One of them is 14. Okay, 14. Go on. I saw them arrive with a food truck. They were singing. They were singing? Amazing. What were they singing? - It doesn't matter what they were singing. Please go on. - They came in and wanted weapons, and to get at the Russians right away. - Is that so? Lovely. What did you do? - I asked if they knew what a gun was. Of course they know what a gun is. - They laughed. And you let them shoot? What at? - At a clothesline post. Did they hit it? - They tore it to shreds. And then? - I gave them hand grenades. Live ones? How did they react? - Like soldiers. Threw and dropped. Did our people watch? - They were amazed. Those boys were golden. They may not be golden, but in these circumstances they're a whole company. You can be proud of the boys. - Proud? What do you mean by that? I'm not proud. Not one bit proud. We want to take them home. Nothing more. I see. But you can't just... What's all this shooting about? What did you do with them? I gave them marching orders. - Good. What does that mean? Did you send them to the front? That's not possible. - But you can't do that! You don't know what it's like, here at the front. Hold position... Hold position again. Always hold position. Don't give one inch of ground. I don't know how I'm supposed to do that. Hardly men or ammunition left... They're just cutting us down, and I have to hold position! There's pure desperation on the map. Can't you see that I'm glad about every man who can hold a gun and pull the trigger? I can't ask how old they are! You can't? Let me say something. - Dear woman... I am not your dear woman. I am Elfriede Bergmann from Stettin. I have two sons, Karl and Leo. They are school children, not soldiers! You can't just send them to the front! I don't care about your war! I didn't make this war! - Listen here... No! I won't listen! I won't listen! I've always held my tongue, like all women do, even though it concerns them the most, because they have to give up their sons. Where did they go? - To the 2nd battalion, Dornberg brigade. What is it? What does that mean? Why are you all looking at each other? What is it? The Dornberg brigade is in active duty since this morning. You actually sent them to the front lines? But that's not possible. Please, you're a general. Give an order to call them back at once! - I can't. Not any more. Not even as a general. I'll see what I can do for your boys. See, see... I don't believe you, not at all! Please ladies... - Oh, come on. We'll show ourselves out. I can understand, they're mothers after all. Perhaps they have to talk that way. But I can't think about mothers! How can I? Can I think about the mothers when I'm giving orders? Can I think about the mothers of my men when I'm ordering them to attack? No general on earth can do that! I can't go on. - Maybe we can stay the night here. Go make sure the light doesn't shine through. It sure looks nice here. Hello? Hello? Is anyone here? Hello? Is anyone here? Hello? Hello! Well, if this was my kitchen... Then let's see. So, everything is fine outside. - Good. Those are mattresses. People must have slept here. What are we waiting for? - There's wood! Should I light the oven? - Go ahead, so it gets warm. Nope... Ah! There's a bit of faux mocha. Put some water on. Yes, it works. So, come on. There. Here. So, we'll have warm coffee soon. Oh, great. We can even lie down. I've got legs like an elephant. She's the strongest out of us all. It has nothing to do with her legs. So, they're pretty clean. - I brought tons of sandwiches. I know how much my boys can eat. There's plenty for us all. That Bergmann, she's worth her weight in gold. So, ladies, help yourselves. - Wonderful. I didn't know how hungry I was. - Neither did I. Thank you! - Butter, super. What are our boys are doing now? If I don't eat, I'll have to cry. We'll get up at 5AM. I've been getting up at 5 for 30 years. I don't need an alarm clock. Open a window. I feel like I'm in a mousetrap when the windows are shut. If you're cold you can crawl in with me. That's how they do it at my house in winter. I know it is wrong for me to be afraid, because I am in your hands. The life of my child is also in your hands. I don't want anything unreasonable. Thy will be done. I do not want Thy will not to be done, but look after my child. I raised him in your name. He is your child, although he is my child. Please God, do not let him die. Let him live. What kind of dump isthis? Gosh! Women! They're women. Come in! There are women! Women? Hey, there's beer! Gosh, the little one! Look at the little one. Hey, Mama. Can I help you with those buttons? I'll give you a good licking! Now, get out of here. What's going on? - Women, Lieutenant. I can see that they're women. Who are you? Where are you from? Is this your house? Three questions at once. Don't you want to throw your men out first? Clear on out. Go on then... What are you doing here at the front? You'll laugh if we tell you. I rarely laugh. I haven't laughed at all in weeks. Then you'll laugh now. Our sons ran away from school. 15-year-old boys at the front. Go on! Laugh! So? So? We're afierthem. When we catch them, we'll take away their guns, and take them home. I'll tell you something. If I had atop hat, I would tip it ceremoniously. That's all I could do for you. Leave now, before you get into trouble. - With who? We did a number on the General. Get lost. There's big trouble and it's not from generals, it's from war itself. What's going on? Can't our men come in? Before you are six brave mommies. They want to fetch their sons from the front. Pardon me, ma'am, but it doesn't matter howl say it. A piece of advice, go home as fast as you can. But we can't... - You can forget about it. We're not going home without our children. I see. Did you see my men? - Bad-mannered ruffians. They're stragglers, you see? They were collected from front command centers, and off the street. They gave them to me and said, "Take them to the front for a while." Of course they don't want to. They've had enough. They lay on the side of the road for a while and... I don't know what they thought about. Maybe about home, or... on something like you. But it's of no use to them. They all have to go back... and perish. - Why are you telling us this? To tell you that these private thoughts are of no use. Not to me. Not to you. Not to anyone. Let them in. We'll stay here for a few hours. I won't listen to that. He has to take us along, the boy. Come on. - Come here! Hurry up! Come on. Here, here, here. Thank goodness... Come on. Come here. Sit down, already! Got a smoke for me, Clemens? May I? - Thanks. Cigarette? - No thanks. I... I saw you before, how you... stood there. - How? With almost nothing on. I was stunned to see you like that. Didn't you look at me, too? No. - You did. You did. You did look at me. I haven't had a girl in my arms for 3 years. I've forgotten how to... No one is watching. You're nice. Listen... Come outside with me? - No. It's not bad. You don't have to be afraid. I just haven't... - Hey you! Get away from there! Stupid guy... Are you coming? I'll wait outside, okay? Do me this favor... please. What are you standing around for? Do you really think she'll come? - Yes. I'll go with her into the backyard. - Give me a drag. I don't think she's coming. She didn't come. What are you wearing? She didn't come. I told you she wasn't coming. Come on, get those clothes off. Put your proper clothes on. Go on. No, I can't. What's that supposed to mean? - Listen... Let me go. All you have to do is turn your back. I have to get away. - Are you nuts? That girl did a number on me. I thought she was coming. I pictured it all in my head. You know, I have the feeling that I'll never experience that again. She could've had her way with me. Do you think I'm not sick of this? Now come on! No, I'm not going to do it. - Be reasonable. You can't go soft now! You've been through a lot worse. Go on! I can't. I can't put them on anymore. I think we have to go. Come on, people! Get ready! You're taking us along. - You're taking us along, right? No, I'm not. What's wrong with you? Is the war over? Do you want to quit? Answer me! Is the war over? My God, the poor guy. Can't you see that he's... - What? That he can't go on. That he's had it. It's no wonder. - Be quiet! Quiet? I'm not quiet. Be quiet when I see something like this? Isn't he right? He's right! Nobody opens their mouth. He's right for wanting to quit. Everyone wants to go home. Our children should come home, too. Everyone should finally go home. Did you hear that? She's right. - It's true, what she says. Yes, sir! It's true all right! - Of course! Just go on home! Yeah! Yeah, go home! You're aware of the penalty? Go! What, is he going to be shot? But you can't do that! At least listen to him! We're begging you. But it's murder! That can't be decided at the drop of a hat! It can now. Go! Move out! I told you. You can't go any further. This is it. This is the front, can't you see that? There's a few hundred men out there, but they'll be wiped out by the Russians. - Wiped out? Got any more sayings like that? Huh? - lsthe Dornberg brigade out there? Are boys there, around 15 or 16? Boys? - Yes. No idea. Robert? Are there boys out there? There's all sorts. Boys too, I think. But golly, you can't go across. They just landed a direct hit here. It's way too dangerous. - Oh, I'm going. You coming?- Yes. Listen to me, you'll never get through! Let them go if they want. They'll see how far they get. Well, I can't stop you. Someone will take you. Lehmann? Go with them? - Bring them overto Captain Dornberg. Should I get it, just for a few skirts? - They can't stay here either. Go. That's when they get you, too. - Enough talking. They sure are sleeping soundly. Sleeping? Can't you see that they're dead? - Dead? I told you before, a direct hit came in before. They'll go down, and we'll have to go get 'em. I told them. Didn't you hear me tell them? It messed me up when they said those guys were sleeping soundly. Be careful. There are mines here. Where isthe captain? - He's in the courthouse cellar. They waltz in here like a church choir. Lehmann, what's going on? Raiding party is cut down? Okay. Turned back to Buchau? Well... Casualties? Just a moment. Oh! What's this? They're from... I don't know. Captain said to bring 'em here. Why? Talk properly, damn it! They're mothers, Captain. Mothers from boys who ran away from school. They're supposed to be here somewhere. I'm handing over the phone. Schneider? - How did you get up here? It's impossible. Impossible? We're here, aren't we? And you're the man we've been looking for. Captain Dornberg, right? Yes. Yes, but that's crazy! This is the front, not a vacation spot. What do you want? - To take our boys back. To take your boys back? - Yes. There is a battle going on. I have better things to do than to take care of women. Schneider, get rid of these women. Have some men take them to safety. - Yes, Captain. Don't you see what it means that we're here? - Please, Captain. Help us. Forgive me, but I don't know howl can help you. Your sons were officially allocated to me by the division. I have no sayin the matter, if you think I do. Report from Hellwig brigade. Leo! Mother? Where did you come from? Leo! Tanks gathering at freight depot. Request ammunition and reinforcements. - Thanks. What? Turn around! I'll give you a licking if you don't turn around! Come on, Mother. - Come on? I've been looking for you for three days. Do you think you can get away that easily? Huh? Stop it, Mother. - Don't you tell me to stop it. What is all this? Where did you get those boots? Who said you could come here? You aren't a soldier! You don't belong here! Where is Karl? Where? Where is Karl? Where is your brother, Karl? He fell in battle yesterday. He fell? Is that supposed to mean that he's dead? Yes, Mother. So, I got here one day too late. For him, at least. What was that? Tanks. Tank shells, Mother. If you say so, my boy. Has anyone else fallen in battle? Tell us! Do you have any more surprises? Not yet. - Can we see them? Yes! I want to see him! - You can't forbid us that! Schneider? - Captain? A dispatch for the 2nd platoon. Reinforcements for Hellwig brigade. They're to bring ammunition. - Yes, Captain. And you, since you're here, you might as well see your boys. It's pure madness that you're here. Come on. Be careful. There is shooting going on. Dispatch for the 2nd platoon. - Here. Get a brigade to Hellwig. They should bring ammunition. Understood, sir. Take off that terrible helmet. Take off the jacket! But Mother... I'm a soldier. I would've become a soldier in a year, anyway. How did it happen with Karl? With Karl? Yes, with Karl. Why didn't you take care of him? You're a year older than him! You've always taken care of him! Of course I took care of him, but... it's a war, not... I mean, you can't really stop someone from getting hurt. How did it happen? Well... We were doing a counterattack, climbing over a fence. The Russians were close. I said to Karl, "I hear them, they must be back there." But he was already keeling over. - He keeled over? I thought he slipped, at first. But... they got him. Got him? - He said that. "Gosh, Leo. They got me." Don't say, "got him"! - But that's what he said! I yelled "medic," right away. What's is that, "medic?" Doctor. But no one came. Why didn't anyone come? I don't know either. I didn't think he was going to die. I just thought, "They sure got him good." Stop saying that! Where is he now? He's still lying out there. Out there? He's still lying where he fell. No one came. I told you that no one came. The Russians advanced and... now you can't get to him anymore. You can't get to him anymore? You'll see. - I can't believe it. Where are they? You'll see. - I can't believe it. Where are they? In there. Down there. Werner! - Inge! How are you doing? - Good. What's wrong, Mom? - What are you doing here? Don't cry. Sorry, Lieutenant. Well, that's new. They should put up signs, "Visitors are not allowed during battle." You should all come home with us. - Home? But we can't. Gosh, Inge. Come on, stop it. Mother? My boy! - Mother! Oh, my darling! I thought they were joking. What's wrong? So this is where you are. What are you doing here? I'm up in the steeple as a lookout. I really thought it was a joke, but it's just like you. What... Why did you come here? - To pick you up. I want to take you home with me. I prayed, "Let me find him. Let me find him so I can take him with me." Yeah, but I mean... why? - And now I have you! But I'm staying here. I'm not coming with you. Do you see that? What? There, on the cross. A grenade... - Just look at him! A grenade came in, that's all. That's all? How can you say that, "that's all?" Come on, my boy. Let us pray. Pray for forgiveness, for all the terrible things people... Prayif19--- There's no point. Praying doesn't help anything. Shooting helps, that's why. I mean, that's why I'm here. That's why? It's actually irresponsible, for me to take you here. Be careful! Stick close to me. If shots are fired, take cover immediately. The Russians are already in our backyard. Quick! In here, please. Is the Asmussen boy here? - One of the boys is in there, Captain. Careful, Captain. Enemy view. Harald! Mother! Mother! How did you get here? MY boy! I was so afraid for you. - But why? The stupid things you're doing! If that rat hat gotten you... Who? - Back there! Sharp shooters! I would've wasted him. But, what are you doing here? How did you get here? I... brought you your sweater. - What? And you should come home! - But I can't just leave! Just look at what's going on here! Look out there. Two men are lying there. Do you see them? I got them. You? - Yes, from the window. You shot them? Yes, I got them good. Three of us shot at them, but I hit them. And... that doesn't bother you? No, not at all. Why? Please, come along. - Yes. Yes. Go Mother, it's better. Go back, you hear? I shouldn't have brought you here. I have to go back, and take him with me! Please let me! No, you can't! You saw him yourself. He wouldn't come with you. The way things are, he's a good man for us. - A man? That is a child. Ifonlyl had more men like him. That's all I can say. I can't make it any easier for you! I know that it is awful for you, but accept that you can't change it. You're the mother, right? - Yes. Is it bad? You can tell me, I'm a doctor myself. I'm Dr. Weigert. - Dr. Behrens. He was shot through the shoulder. A bit complicated. Any broken bones? - No, but... he's lost a lot ofblood. Mother! Mother! I heard already, but I didn't believe it. I thought they were all crazy, but then I did believe it... because... It's nothing, Mother. I don't feel athing. My harmonica. I brought it along. Mother? I'm getting the wound badge, and maybe even the iron cross! Yes. I cracked a tank! Don't you believe me? Yes, yes. Yes. Of course. Are you in pain? - No, Mother. Gosh, I sure was glad that I shot it! He's from my school. He's... He's dying- Mother? Are you? Are you? Are you there, Mother? (Yes, my b0)'- I'm with you. There, there. Don't be afraid. I'm with you, do you hear? Where... did you come from? No need to ask. Sleep. Relax. Sleep, my boy. Mother? When... When he's dead, Mother, they'll take him away from here! Yes. My sincere thanks. Please stop by again soon. Next. There you are ma'am. No, go to the back. Ladies first, please. It's all free of charge here, ma'am. Cigarettes? - No thanks. Naturally, German women don't smoke. Anything else? Big sale on geese and pigs! We're clearing the shelves and closing up shop! - Shut up! Oh, calm down. - Here, Mrs. Bergmann. It's a girl! Where did you come from? From Stettin. - It's still there? Don't stare. - Come on, I look at your mug every day. Eat something, Mrs. Bergmann. I can't eat. It'sthe first time that I can't eat. Lard, sausage, bread and jam. There... and even more. I don't want any more. - Too bad. Boy, oh boy! She'sjust my style. Fetch some more hot water, okay? - Yes, Doctor. I have to take a short break. There's more coffee. I'll get some. Thanks. I've been worried about you. I knew you'd have to face this moment. Why? I can see it in you. You know, I'm a little different from you. I... I only expect what happens. Yeah, it's a matter of attitude. Then there aren't any surprises. Surprises... When you come and you don't recognize your own son anymore. Heis... He showed me two men that he had shot. Can't we speak to the Captain again? He's a decent person. He has to let us take our children. They just think it's funny that women suddenly appeared. He didn't laugh. They'll send us away tomorrow. If we don't go voluntarily, then they'll use force. They don't need mothers on the front. It's great, actually. Nobody's there. Everyday, a different bed. Today it's in a villa! Could you give us a floor? - No problem. We'll cheer you up, Mom. So, let's go get some wine. - Leave her here, okay? Oh, I'll bring her back. Come on. - Where to? - Don't be so curious. So, what do you think? Look at it... My cellar. Anything you want, even Bordeaux! Like Bordeaux? I don't know, I've never had Bordeaux. Then it's about time, eh? And we've got time. Why? Don't you have to go out like the others? No. I don't have to stand forthat. Why not? Because of this. Oh. I didn't notice. Gone! Lost for good. I thought you got sent home with something like that. Yeah, I thought so too. It's actually a hilarious story. When it happened I thought, "They got that, now I'm going home" I got as far as Posen, but there was a company there. So I'm still with the outfit, and I swear about it every day. You know why? I've got the feeling I'm gonna kick the bucket here. What are you looking at? It's not that important. Come on, I'll show you my villa. And? What did I tell you? Sure is high-class, eh? Perfect for a private in the German Armed Forces. They left everything here! - They were smart. Have a seat, where ever you want. And there's a piano. Were they supposed to take it along? - It's dusty. Yeah, well... What? Can you play? - Yes. Stuff like that still exists? We have one at home in Stettin, too. I played that a lot. Even four-handed with my brother. Ah. Especially in the afternoon, when the aunts were there. Very pretty. Do me a favor and knock it ofi. Have a drink instead. Here are some glasses. Come on. Should I help you? - No. I can still get bottles open. - I've never drunk a lot of wine. I've never been away from home. - You don't say. Or someone was always with me. - You see? Now I'm with you. Come on, drink. Cheers. I'm glad I can talk with you. I trust you. Tell me, do you know why I brought you up here? Huh? Because you're a girl! Because there's wine, music and there's beds here, understand? What, are you from the moon? - Why? - Why? Gosh. I don't know if you'll get out of here, or if you'll get your brother out. But I do know something. It doesn't make any difference, kid. I've served this whole war long. lfthere's one thing I've learned, it's that nobody cares! Not about you, or me, or your brother! Nobody gives a hoot what happens! And you know what? It doesn't matter! The only things that matter are having something to eat, to drink, and sleep! So... You can go now, if you want to. Why do you talk like that? Because... Let's go in here. Will you look at that! - Here he is, with a girl! Come, here's some wine. There's a corkscrew. Here's another bottle, here. Well I'll be! Where did she come from? - Stettin. Cute kids there, eh? Come here! Have a drink! Just a little sip more. Cheers. Don't you dance? - Me? Of course. I've got a wooden hand, not a wooden leg. Want to dance with me? Let them be. - Gosh, another bottle! Look! A gorgeous, full bottle! Give me a corkscrew! - Gimme some! Where does he get this stuff? - He's got the time for it... Why did you stop? You're trembling. No I'm not. Yes you are. Your whole body is trembling. I can feel it. What, are they still here? - Yes. I thought they left with their moms. - No. They want to keep playing cowboys and Indians. Maybe they're heroes, I don't know. - Heroes? No such thing. The existence ofheroes is a common misconception. Go on Doctor, let it out. Admittedly, one has always felt it necessary, in all the Leader's nations, to invent them. One needs them for the storybooks and to instill national reverence, even though they don't exist. - It's nice how he says that, huh? Do you have a hero like that at home? - If you mean a boy like that, then I do. He's 12. - Maybe he'll show up too someday and say, "Come on, old man. Let's win this war." Well, if he did, I'd hit him in the face. My mother is great. She didn't mind at all. She wanted to bring me my sweater. She didn't say anything else? - A little, but she has to. My mother isn't like that. She's religious, you know? And not just a little, either. Tell me... Do you believe in God? What makes you think that? - I don't know. I don't think there is one. They say there's a God, because they want there to be one. It'd probably be nice. Stop with all that stuff. Why didn't ask in religion class? Religion class? Who could I have asked? Rothe? What about Rothe? Or Bracht? If he could only see us now. Gosh, can you imagine what he'd say? Bracht... Watch this. The level of attention in this classroom leaves a lot to be desired. Asmussen... It's Asmussen again. Naturally. What do you have there, Asmussen? Let me see that. What's all this about, Assmussen? You should be more worried about... weapons of the intellect. What's going on here? Have you lost your minds? Do you want to get the Russians on our backs? They'll give us all a whipping. Be quiet. Harald, do you think the Russians will come tonight? Have you hit any yet? - Me? Of course. Notme. I don't know why. I always pull the trigger too late. You're not afraid, are you? - No, no. I just... My hands are too hot. I think... as soon as I hit one, it'll stop. You think I am the master of life and death, at least for your children, but I'm not. Why did you come back again? To ask you one more time, give us our sons back. I... Accept it, I can't help you. It's impossible. - Why is it impossible? Everyone speaks of orders as if they can't do any thing about them. There must be something that can be done. My husband fell in battle. Should I lose my son, too? He is all I have, no one else. I understand you very well, but... - Isn't there anything you can do? You don't know my orders. I am to hold this site, down to the very last man. What does that mean? That... Those orders are madness. It doesn't make sense. - I don't know if it makes sense. I can't starting wondering if orders make sense! - Why not? I've been fighting this war for five years. You don't have anytime to think. You shoot, sleep, starve, you... march and who knows what else. I always thought it'd be over soon, and it'd be... like it was before. But you see, that's not true. You go very far away. You can't go back. You have no choice, no decision, nothing. I understood that when I saw you. When you saw me? - Yes. You belong to a world one is thrown out of. I'd like to help you, but... Maybe you would understand me if I... Someone else came to me for help once. - Yes? Are you cold? Thanks. I had a friend, Lieutenant Wildersen. Oh well... that's over. We were always together. I never had a better friend. Not only because we went through all this crap together. And then, somewhere near Demyansk... I forget what that villiage was called. It was the middle of winter, about -30° outside... It was a war like the ones wolves lead. We were no longer human. It was just punching, biting, rasping, death and rot on both sides. We were surrounded by the Russians. All was lost. We got the order break out. But Wildersen was lying there on the ground. He was wounded on his leg and on both arms. He couldn't move, he... was in great pain. We couldn't take him with us. We had to leave all the wounded behind. Do you know what that means? That means: to freeze, be beaten, to starve. The worst thing you can imagine isn't bad enough. And Wildersen laid there and said, "You are my friend. Shoot me." I said, "You're crazy. You're not lost. The Russians have doctors too." He said, "Do it, my friend." I said, "No." He said, "Do it for my mother." "No, I can't!" "I don't have anyone but you. But I still won't do it." I thought he would pass out, but he didn't. He didn't want to. He said, "I am very calm. I'm not desperate, but I will be if you go, and leave me lying here." Would you have been able to bear that? I did leave. I left him lying there. I walked about 30 meters, then I went back. When I came in and he saw the gun, he smiled. He shouldn't have asked that of me, but because he asked, I had to do it. Ever since, I've been lost. Somehow lost, and I'm aware of it every second. I wish I could help you. You help me? Yes. My God, it's not possible. It's a little crazy, in the middle of all this. Don't you think? As if being happy were forbidden. Maybe it is forbidden. No. You have no idea what all this means to me. And here, in this godforsaken place that one didn't even know of before, not even by name. - You don't have to say anything. I feel the same way. A special moment probably comes for everyone. You just have to be able to wait. Do you hear that? - It's like that every morning. Please, I have to ask you something. What's going to happen with the children? Couldn't they be moved back, so that they aren't right at the front? I'm sure that can be done, right? Was this all because of that? What do you mean? No! Believe me! You're lying to yourself. You did this for your son. No, really. I... Please! They're coming! Tanks! Tanks! Pull back to the houses! Back! Back! Tanks are coming! Go! Back! To the houses! Back! Go back! Go on! Come on! Over here! Get down idiots! We can't just lie here! Face in the dirt, boy! Stay here! Stay here! - But I have to get out of here! My mother, she'll go mad... with Karl already... Dear God, nothing else can happen... - Should we pray? Will we die? - If we have to die, then... Don't you dare say, "honorably!" It's horrible to die! Nobody's ever done it gladly. Now they're bombing our boys, and I can't do anything about it? I've always done something! Always! But not now! You raised them. You nursed them. Bathed, washed them... You went crazy making sure nothing happened to them, that their milk wasn't too cold. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Medic! Forgive us our sins... I don't want to... I don't want to die! - Come here! Just cry, why don't you? Make him stop! Cry, my boy, if it helps. - Mother! Call for your mom as loud as you want. I'll punch that guy who's laughing. Come here, take that. You guys really jumped right into this merry mess, huh? But there'll be no ticker-tape parade. We're not gonna win. - You're not allowed to say that! I'm not allowed to? Oh, kid... I'll say what I want, understand? Those are my last words to my nation. Curses! You should be ashamed, you coward... What is it? Oh, this junk? That's not the war. War is filth! Nothing but filth! The ones who lose the war, they know that. They never forget it. The ones who win, they forget it right away. Medic! Over here! Medic! Both my grenade throwers are gone, too. 2nd group was almost completly annihilated. Our reinforcements, Captain? So, that was the last one. The last one for today... Maybe, for today. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes. - You get used to everything, almost everything. - What don't you get used to? That you get tired. More tired than you can imagine. So tired, that you forget your own name. Would you like some? - No thanks. Tired with the knife in your hand. Do you understand? Did you know that death is fantastic? It's sleep, ultimate sleep. The peace of death. Peace! Should people onlyflnd peace afiertheyre dead? No. I've seen too many people die. I can't philosophize about death. I hate death. And this is the most despicable kind of death. The stupidest. You're a woman, you have to talk like that. But I've been in casualty stations for five years, and todayl say that death is something sacred. Even if it tears limbs, if it comes from rain, mud and snow. Nonsense! Life is sacred! Only that, and nothing else! You have a lot of love inside. I have absolutely nothing to do with love. Where's the Captain? - Over there, somewhere. - Okay. Captain? What is it, Schneider? Report from the western blockade, Captain. We're surrounded. Give me the details. Patrols have already spotted "Ivan" in Birkenwaldchen. That's at the west gate. Still no radio contact with the division? - No. We can't make radio contact, Captain. Thanks, Schneider. Well, then. The route to the west is closed, too. It's all over. We'll make it, Captain. - Do you think? Attention! It's the captain! - Don't get up, boys. Everything okay, Asmussen? - Yes, Captain. The Russians won't get through here, Captain. Yeah... And you... Be careful. What happened to your brother is bad enough, okay? I'm supposed to send you back to the townhall. Not yet please, Captain. I want to stay with the others. Yes, you heard me right. We're attempting a break out. 20:00: disengage the enemy, pull back to the church. 20:30: take over the A defllade, west gate. Orders issued at exactly 18:00. Out. You're in charge of the tank trap. It has to be passable for vehicles at 20:00. - Yes... Yes, Captain. Why are you looking at me like that? - Captain, we don't have any orders. Don't you think what I'm doing is reasonable? - Reasonable? It couldn't be more reasonable, Captain. Not just because Prenzlau is my home. That's an hour away. - Well then... I'm only trying to save 150 lives. - Yes, yes... I doubt anybody would get us out of this jam now, but Captain... you know how they are. They're quick to execute. That's what I mean. Possible. But I can't just... sacrifice people anymore. I... Behind every soldier, I start seeing the woman who gave birth to him. Yeah, but... Captain, you can't say that to anyone. Everything understood? - Yes, Captain. I attack both sides of the street with the platoons and open the vehicle exit point. Then I shoot the flare. - Good. You were right, Mother. We are going to make it out. What did I tell you? Get in there. 1st and 2nd platoon, follow. Go on ahead. Faster. Don't worry, kid. It'll go fine. Look, knock on wood. I'll look after this one. - We'll get through, right? I think it will go well. Let's not get too high-spirited. What I wanted to say to you... You can't stay in Stettin. Get away from there. Go to Westphalia. This is my parent's address. Tell them I said hello, and that's all you'll need. And don't lose it. - I won't. Please don't lose it. Now, get in that truck! - I'm not allowed to. Who says? I say you're allowed. But we have to cover you. Get in! They won't notice, they're all wounded. Nobody will say anything! I already had to leave one here! I'm taking you with me! We're all afraid, it's okay. You're no soldier. - Yes, Mother, I am a soldier. I shot someone. The children ride with the women. Go on, get in! Schneider, get the boys together and put them on this truck. Yes, Captain. - He said to get in! Go on kids! You're homeward bound! I don't understand. Should we just steal into the night... - Come on, just be glad! They say there's no order to break out. - So? You with your "so?" number. Damn it. - What do you mean, "damn it"? It's great! Ifit's true, he'll be court-martialed. - You and your court-martials! He'll go to the firing squad! - As if that'd do any good. We withdrew from the outskirts, Captain. - Thanks. We head the rear cover at the exit point. - All right, Captain. What are you doing here? Get on the truck. - I have a question. I just heard that... - What? Is it true that you'll be court-martialed? Please get on the truck. - Is it true? I... maybe but... - You did it for me? No. No, I did not do it for your sake. - I don't believe you. We have to go. - No, I'm not going. Please don't send me away. Tell me the truth. My God, nothing can happen to you. I don't understand. Are you afraid? Are you afraid for me? - Yes. Out of... compassion? No, it has nothing to do with that. Is that true? Yes. Helene, I... - Captain! Captain, the departure. The women have to get on the truck! Yes, we'll be right there. I have to go. - Will we see each other again? I don't know. I can't imagine anything better than seeing you again. We have to go. - I can't leave like this! Quick, in the truck! Mount and fire up! Ready! Mount! Go! Move out! Dismount! The way is clear, Captain. The convoy can pass, but the Russians won't let up! We need reinforcements! - Okay. Go! Why did you go against orders and clear the site? The Russians were too superior in numbers. We counted 60 tanks. Only 150 men were left in the entire garrison. Our last cannon was lost yesterday. Ammunition was scarce... How long could you have held position? Maybe 3 days, or maybe just 2 or 1. Who told you that we weren't depending on that one day? Or maybe on just 12 hours, or maybe 6? What were you thinking, Dornberg? I don't want to try to glorify my actions. - But you are! You say you counted 60 tanks, that ammunition was scarce! You're saying all sorts of things! I knowl asked a lot of you and your people, but can't I count on an officer? Should I think, "I hope my orders will be followed." "Hopefully Captain Dornberg will do as I say"? I am ready to face the consequences. - That won't do me any good. But was it the arrival of the women that got you so stirred up? They were here too. Something like that can really get to you. I'm well aware of that. We can talk openly, Dornberg. You know as well as I do, this war is lost. There can only be weeks left... terrible weeks. And in the end, we won't be able to change a thing. But I don't understand, General. If we know that, can we let more people die? The 150 that I am responsible for? And the 10,000 whose fate is in your hands? Whose fate is in my... No matter what you say, Captain, we cantjust step outside the law. Neither you, nor I can do that! Come in, Major. Yes. Captain Dornberg is under arrest. Come on. What, are we gonna be in the news? - You? No, those boys there. Well, take a look at them. They're a bit tattered for hero pictures. It's not up to us to write the text. - Who are those women? Just the mothers of the boys. What, are we making family portraits? H ey! Mothers, move out of the way, please. The General! Attention! Is that them? - Yes, General. War reporters have arrived as well, by special order from headquarters. Well, then. Dornberg brigade reporting for the l.C. ceremony. Thanks. At ease. Company! At ease! Men of the Dornberg brigade, I have the proud honor of being able to decorate you for outstanding courage, and fearlessness in the face of the enemy. Your spirit... Men of the Dornberg brigade, your spirit guarantees... victory... That's baloney! What kind of baloney is that? For victory... our inevitable victory. Well, boys... I mean... you know how it goes. Give them to me. Is that the division? - I can't make contact! Damn it! They're attacking the entire line! Try again! What about the 67's and Kaufmann? Tank infiltration 5 km deep, reaching Steininger Mountain, advancing towards the Oder. The Russians will be here in three hours. Lieutenant Lange. Report from Winterstein brigade. Heavy casualties. Heavy artillery lost. Can't hold position. Request permission to disembark. - Hold position. We can't lose level 58. General, the division is too weak to hold position. The only point to seal off! Get Dornberg. - Yes, General. General... - Eichberg should regroup for counterattack. Obediently reporting for duty. - Set your men in motion towards... General, Kaufrnann can't hold position either. May I order a retreat to D line? No. Listen, Captain. I... I need you. Set your men in motion towards... level 58. Report to Winterstein. Yes, General. That won't be enough. - The division will not retreat! Sergeant Hauptmann! Ready? - Dornberg brigade ready to move out. Move up to the forest. - Move up to the forest! What is it? What's going on? What's going on? - We have to get back into that mess. Get vehicles back into the old order. Come on, boys. Get back in the trucks! Not the boys! - Boys? The Russians got through! Go on, boys! Leo, stay here! Leo, you're staying here with me! Our children are not getting in there! We won't let our children go with you! They're staying here! Do what you want! Shoot me dead, if you want to! We don't have anything to do with it! - Shut up. Listen, lady. You talk too much. Get lost, why don't you? Take off and get the boys out of here. - He's right! Go on! Get in there! Get it through your heads! You should disappear! Get the kids out of here! - Hide the boys! Get in there! Hide! Stay here! Stop the car. What's wrong, Dornberg! Move out, already! Yes, Major! Go! Drive! God in heaven, they're really going back. Leave God out of it. It's man's doing. It's always man's doing. THE END Subtitles." TITELWERK Translation." Annie Grossjohann
