Oh yeah. - I still got no idea what I'm gonna do this year. - You just see what happens. That's what we did last year. (Jerry chuckles) - And nothing happened. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [Pete] Cheers to nothing. (bottles clanging) - Yeah, but, better to make some plans. - Plans? - Yeah. Better to be safe than sorry. - Man, you make plans, they fuck up, you get depressed. Better not to plan anything man. Just, y'know, let it go, y'know. (both chuckle) Yeah. - Let's go. - No, not yet. You reckon she'll be there? (Jerry chuckles) - She's always there. What makes you think she likes you anyway? - Why? What makes you think she like you? - Don't know! Why wouldn't she? - Why would she is the real question. (both chuckle) Can't get much better than her. You sure she's gonna be there? - How the fuck am I supposed to know? Come on, let's go. Come on! (liquid bubbling) (slow rock music) (fast rock music) ♪ It scares me 'cause I'm not scared ♪ ♪ But it I'm not scared does that mean I care. It enlightens me ♪ ♪ To think of you and all the crazy shit we used to do ♪ - G'day Cheryl. You're looking good. - Compliment Pete? Do you want something? - Oh, I have to think about that. The question is, do you want something? - How 'bout putting a smile on my face Pete? - I'll put a smile on your face. There's this horse that walks into a pub, right? And the barman says, "Why the long face?" How's that? What? What's wrong Cheryl? That's a, that's a fucking good joke? Hey, don't you get it? Horse walks into a pub. Horse, y'know, horse, long face. - Yeah, Pete, I get it. - Now you got a long face. You want some dope, is that why you're here? I got 50s and 20s. How much you got? - Jerry here? (people chattering) - How's it going Pete? - Going all right. - Fuckin' give us one of them on tick mate? - "Do not ask for credit, as refusal may offend." (Kenwood chuckles) - Don't smoke it all. - I won't. - Better not. Oh, go Mick your taxi's here mate! Boo! Boo! Oh next time Mickey! See ya mate. - Stay good! - [Jerry] Say g'day to Al! - [Pete] I bet he fucks her. - [Mick] He's gonna try, but that doesn't mean that she'll let him. - Yeah, he'll get her stoned, then he'll fuck her. - Well, if you're so worried, you shouldn't have given him the pot. - Well what was I supposed to do, he's my fuckin' cousin. - Yeah, well you never give dope to anyone else do ya? Oh like, yeah yeah, like, thanks, but you know what I mean? Like if you were going to give the pot to someone, you should have given it to her in the first place, then you'd be the one fucking her. - [Pete] Jerry would've got her anyway. Always does. - [Mick] You reckon? - [Pete] Yep. - I don't know even why you're so hassled, you haven't even fucked her. - If I'd fucked her I wouldn't be missing anything would I? - You know what I'd do if I was you? If I had the money you have? - What? - Hire a pro. Then you don't have to go through all the bullshit of trying to get a fuck, and not even getting one. Pro's are money in the bank, that's what my old man reckons. - Your Dad? - Yeah, I think he goes to them all the time man. He reckons there's some real babes in there. You just go and you can have whichever one you want. Have them every time. He even reckons that there's some in there that looks like Elle MacPherson. Yeah. - What about your old lady? - Nah, she doesn't look a fuckin' thing like Elle MacPherson. (tense music) - Ah, G'day Pete. - Ah there he is. It's old mate. How ya goin', old mate? Oh boys, you're here. Oh good, good, good. - What do you want? - What do I want? - Ahh, bit of smoko? - Oh, smoko yeah that was it, yeah, yeah. Got any that smoko left, Pete? - Got any money yet? - Same conundrum. I got no money, he's got the smoko, he wants money. You blokes don't have any money do you? - Nah. - Nah, I did all mine on the pokies. - It's not really workin', is it? On the pokies, yeah. Fuck those fucking pokies I tell you.

(Cheryl groaning) - [Jerry] I fucked her. - Fuck off! I don't give a fuck. - We'reonna go out again tomorrow night, ay? What the fuck happened to you? Hey? - What the fuck does it look like? - Who did it? - Gary Kenwood. Fuckin' asked for one on tick. I told him to piss off, he must've followed me. - [Jerry] How much did he get? - Everything. - Sweet, we'll fix that prick hey. - Nah, it wasn't just him. All of his mates. We'd have to kill them all. Hey. What was she like? - She was all right. - Yeah? - [Jerry] Yeah, she was all right. - Bullshit, you didn't fuck her, did ya, hey? (Jerry chuckles) - Taste that. - Come on, spill the fucking beans, what was she like? - Yeah, she was all right. - [Pete] Just "All right?" - She was pretty fucking good. - Yeah. (Jerry laughing) Where? - In the canals. The usual spot. Jerry, Jerry! She's got a top body Pete. Heaps tight. I don't reckon she fuckin' gets around much. - Then go for it, what have you got to lose? - You're not pissed off are ya? - Nah, just like you said, you're the one who gets them. - Bullshit, you get as many birds as me. - Nah, not lately. - What about that bird with the braces? - Who? Janelle? - Yeah, that one. She's all right. She loves giving a bit of head, don't she? - She never went down on me. - Oh man. - Anyway, all the girls I get you've already fucked. - Not the one who had the Maori boyfriend. Hey bro. (Jerry imitates punching) - Did a fuckin' good job on you, didn't they? What did you say his name was? - Gary Kenwood. - Yeah, I know that mother fucker. He took my money? - He took my money too! - [Steve] Do you know where he lives? - Nope. - Fuck! I need the cash Pete. You better not be shitting me. I mean I know you're not, but you better fuckin' not be. You know what I'm saying? - Why would I be shitting you, Steve? - I never said you were man. I just want my fuckin' money back. (hood slams) You sell this stuff, I get my money back, and you still come out on top. You want a line? - No man, the last time I had that fuckin' shit I was awake for two fuckin' days just chucking my guts up. I mean, you know, I'll sell it, but, you know, it's too full-on for me. - What, you mean addictive? That's bullshit man. Fucking durries are addictive. (Steve sniffing) - Hey I'm not gonna carry syringes on me, eh. - No, they'll work it out. - Hey, what happened to that girlfriend you had? - Which one? - The one that was staying here last year? - Oh, Rebecca. I don't know, she was just fucking with my head man. - [Pete] Yeah. You still seeing her? - Now and then, but she only fucks with the head I want her to fuck with y'know? Why, you want a go? - No, no fuck no. No. - You got the hots for someone? Not one of Jerry's again? Oh man. (Steve chuckles) Learn. Learn. - Come on, give it a chance Pete. - Why aren't you telling me what she looks like? - You don't even know her. Hey boys. (phone ringing) - [Pete] She's a fuckin' dingo, isn't she? (Jerry laughs) - She's a great person. - Which one is she? - Look, no one's telling you you have to fuck her. Just have a fuckin' good time. (Jerry laughs) - [Pete] You didn't tell me it was her. Come on. - [Cheryl] Pete. Fuck, been in the wars Pete? - Yeah. You know Stacey, Pete? - Yeah, I know her. - Want a ciggie? Winnie Blue? - Come with a light? - You hungry?

(girls laughing) - I like gherkins. They taste all right. - Do ya Pete? - I'm gonna go to the toilet. Move. - So Pete, what do you think of Stacey? Do you wanna fuck her? - I hardly know her. (Jerry chuckles) - As if that would stop you. - Just be careful, she's not on the pill. Poor girl, she must be uncomfortable. - Why? - We both went shopping today and bought some crotchless knickers. And I don't think Stacey's gotten used to them yet. 'Cause you gotta wear them in, you know? - Sweet. (gun firing) (men shouting) (Stacey groaning) - Do you mean it? I wanna know that you mean it. - Yeah, I mean it you're the fuckin' best okay? You're fuckin' great. - You're not wearing crotchless knickers. Is she? (Jerry laughing) (Stacey moaning) Go Pete! - Shh, fuck it. (heavy breathing) (Stacey grunting) - [Stacey] Oh, not so hard! (Jerry and Cheryl chuckling) - [Pete] Oh Cheryl! - [Stacey] What, what did you say? What did you call me? - Oh fuck. Oh shit. - What did you just call me? - What, I didn't say anything. - Fucken cock! - [Cheryl] Stace! Nice one. Stacey, wait! - What the hell happened Pete? What? - I don't know, fuck.

(Jerry laughing) I thought you were your Mum, hey. - You sort it out with Steve? - Yeah. - Needs some work, hey? - Be better off knocking it down. It'd make a good bonfire, don't you reckon? (Pete laughs) - Remember when we used to sleep out here? - What are you doing tonight? - Cheryl asked me to go over to her place. You got any pot? - No. Hey, try some of this on her. Might work wonders. - How long it last? - Long enough, why? - Got a job interview in the morning. - How the fuck did he get this man? Employment agencies never fuckin' give me anything. Always say that I'm unsuitable, under-fuckin'-qualified, or some bullshit. He won't get this job. - He might. - Who cares anyway, man. I don't want a fuckin' job. Spend the rest of my days slogging my guts out just to owe other people money! Fuckin' assholes! There's gotta be another way, man. - There is. - I got the job. - That's great man. (Mick laughing) - Oi, how'd that stuff go with Cheryl? Did yous go all night? - Come on Pete, bit of respect for the man's woman. It's none of our business how loud she howls, is it Jerry? What stuff you talking about? Jerry, you got some stuff man? (Western music) (light humming) - 1200. It's all there. - Money in the bank. (Steve sniffling) Same again? - Whatever's going.

Why not? - What, you'd really do it? - All we ever do night after fucking night is talk about getting laid, and then all we end up doing is going home and having a wank. - You just go pick some women up. - That's the whole point. Where've we been tonight? Any time we do that, all we end up getting is a bunch of bad heads prick teasing us, then we just end up back here talking about it again. - Go to a pro. - No, I don't have any money. - [Pete] I'll give you the money. - Where's the fun in that? You know what's gonna happen. You give them the money and you know what's gonna happen. I don't want to fuck someone that everyone else has been fucking. I want someone special. - I don't reckon I could do that, hold a woman down. I don't reckon I could bone up. - Yeah you could, if she was good-looking enough you could. I've seen this girl man. Walks down Ginny Lane every day after work. She's a real spunk. Blonde hair. Tight mini skirt. I'd love to fuck her. 5:30 every day.

So you're probably better off going home and getting some sleep. - You don't know anything? - Well I do know he wouldn't be here if he wasn't so drunk. - What are you saying? You saying it's his fault? - If he'd been sober when the car had hit him, he probably would've died from the shock. He's very lucky to be alive. Okay. - [Steve] Hang on a fucking second. You're better off in an accident if you're pissed? She told you this? - Yeah, yeah, that's, that's the fucking bullshit part of it man. They know this so they make a fuckin' law that tells you you can't drive when you're pissed, 'cause they know that if people did they wouldn't get so fuckin' like hurt and they wouldn't have to go to the doctors, so the fuckin' doctors would go out of business y'know? - Yeah, yeah, sure Pete, that makes a lot of sense man. - [Pete] It's a fucked up world we live in. - Fuckin' right about that Pete. (Pete sniffing) - I just feel like I should've done something. Like, I should've seen the car or done something. Like I should've fuckin' caned the driver, you know? - You were pissed Pete, he would've decked ya. - It makes no difference now. - Mick's gotta go to a rehabilitation centre. - That means he's gonna get better. - [Steve] They never tell you the whole fuckin' story man. - I gotta get going. I'm going to go and meet Cheryl. - You got a girlfriend now Jerry? - [Jerry] Yep. - That's fucking great man, how long? - About a month. - A month? Shit, so it's serious, eh? Fucken good on ya man. I'm lucky to get through a whole pack of frangers with just one sheila, man. (Steve and Pete chuckling) - Yeah, well I'm supposed to be meeting her. - Well, fuck, you don't want to be late. We'll give you a lift, hey Pete? - Nah, nah, it's all right. - No, no, no, no... - No, no it's all right, stay. - No, no, no, fuck no, of course. Let's go, come on, let's go. - Steve, why don't we take your car? - My car's a heap of shit. If you're meeting your girlfriend, you want a fuckin' nice one don't you? (lock clangs) (Pete laughing) Get in. - [Jerry] Come on! (engine revs) (upbeat rock music) - Hey Steve, you reckon we're pissed enough? - No way man, you're never pissed enough. Give me one, come on.

(car screeches) (everyone laughing) - [Jerry] Just slow the fuck down. - [Cheryl] Come on baby, this is fun. - [Pete] Yeah, calm down Jerry. What have you got to lose? - More than you. - [Pete] What the fuck's that supposed to mean? What the fuck are you talking about man? - Nothing, just fucking look at the road. Pete watch the fuckin' road! (car screeches) (everyone screams) (glass shatters) (slow tense music) (car hissing) (dog barking) (everyone laughing) - Yeah! It's okay! - Oh fuck. - It's okay everybody! - Oh shit. - [Pete] We're pissed! (Steve laughing) See! Not a scratch! - [Pete] Jerry. Jerry, hey. Jerry? Jerry? - Pete, Pete. - [Pete] Where are they? Jerry? - Oi, oi, oi. - [Jerry] You fuckin' could have killed her you dickhead! Come on. - Oh, let's go. (Steve and Pete laughing) - Woo! Yeah! Oh fuck... Woo! Steve! (birds chirping) Hey man! - How ya doing? Ha ha! Hey! Hey man. See her? Her name's Kylie. Came off the back of a bike, her boyfriend was killed. She's a real nice bird. (Mick laughs) She was a cook, that was her job. Said she's gonna teach me to how to do it, man. Some flat spaghetti thing with mushrooms. Soon as I get out of this bed. (Mick laughs) Yeah, I think she likes me. - Yeah, what's wrong with her? - Snapped her spinal cord in the accident. She's a paraplegic. (both chuckle) - That's unlucky. Bet you can't wait to get out of here, hey Mick. - Yeah man. Same thing happened to me, Pete. (Mick chuckles) I'll never be able to walk again. - What? - Yeah. - [Pete] What are you gonna do? - Oh, I'm just gonna roll with it. (Mick laughs) What's in the bag? - Magazine. Relieve the tension. - Thanks man. That's all I seem to be getting. Pornos and flowers. Awe. - Hey. Have you got any feeling? - Still waiting to find out. Not much control though. It's pretty messy. - No, no, I mean, you know, can you do it? - Yeah, they reckon that you can. I've heard that paraplegics have had kids. I might even con Kylie into giving it a go. - It's nice here, hey? - Yeah, it's pretty cool hey? - Sounds like you're having a good time. - I nearly died Pete. It might sound like bullshit to you, but, I'm fuckin' alive man. I never felt alive before. It's fuckin' excellent! (Mick laughs) (ambient music) (truck screeches) - What the fuck are you doin' you idiot? Get off the fucking road! Move it! (girls laughing) (girls chattering) (Pete sniffing) (train clacking) (girls laughing) - [Girl] Who does that on the train? - Weird. (slow paced music) (light humming) - Hi. - Hello. - I was on the train. - Oh, I'm on my way home. - I just wanted to say hello. You smiled at me. - [Elizabeth] What do you want? - I just wanted to say hello. You're really beautiful and... - Thanks for saying that. But, I've been at work all day and I really just wanna get home. - I told him you'd try to see him on the weekend. - [Jerry] How was he? Did he talk much? - [Pete] He's pretty fucked up. - [Jerry] Yeah, well if something like that happens to you you're gonna lose it a bit, aren't you? - Yeah, but still, he's talking about cooking and shit. You know? Cooking. - Nothing wrong with cooking. - You know what I mean. You know what I mean? - I'll meet you at the pub after work. - Hey do you reckon they'll give you a night off sometime Jerry? - If I take the night off it looks like I don't care about the job. - Could've fooled me. - I gotta go. See ya Pete. (Jerry clucks) - Hey, where ya going? Hey, check this out. (Pete laughing) - Yeah but aren't models supposed to be taller? - Who said that? - Me, I did. - [Cheryl] What are you saying? Calling me a short ass? - [Pete] Don't look at me like that. - [Cheryl] Like what? - Like that. - Fuck off. (Pete sniffing) - [Pete] I still prefer pot. This shit makes me feel like I'm going crazy. - You ever shot it? - No, have you? - No, but they reckon it gives you a better hit. - Still rather smoke a cone. - Do you like me Pete? - Yeah. You're all right. - Just all right? It's not what I heard. - What do you mean? - Stace said you called her my name. - That's fucking bullshit. Why would I call her your name? - I don't know, why would ya? - You're fucked in the head. - Then what are you doing here with me Pete? - Want a beer? - You didn't answer my question. (metal clanging) - Shit, I think it's Jerry. How the fuck did he know we were here? - Pete Simpson. - Kenwood, what do you want? - Fuck, she fuckin' looks alright doesn't she?

You can keep watching telly if you want. Pete, just make sure you lock the door when you leave. - What you wanna do? - We should go and meet Jerry, he'll be waiting for us. - Okay.

He said Kenwood got killed last night, bashed to death in the canals. Looks like someone beat us to it, Pete. (thunder cracking) - Don't look like we're getting our fuckin' money back. Don't worry about it, don't worry about it. Water would've washed the prints off it, alright? Where's Cheryl? Does she know? (Cheryl laughing) - Cheryl, this is heavy shit, okay.

What'd you say to him? - Nothing. - No, no I mean about what I, I mean what you said about, where you went, you tell him where you went last night? Hey? - I told him I wasn't feeling well so I went home early, are you happy? - He didn't say anything? - Nothing that's any of your business. Look Pete, I said I wouldn't say anything and I haven't and I won't, so would you stop stressing about it? - Yeah, I just don't want you two to break up 'cause of me, you know. - Jerry's job's gonna take care of that. Look, I had a good time last night. - Look Cheryl, last night was a fuckin' mistake. Yeah I mean it was fun, but it shouldn't have happened. It shouldn't have happened. It shouldn't have happened. (thunder rumbling) - Do you always run away after sex? Can't you handle having a conversation after you've done it Pete? Oh but I guess you'd be talking to your hand most of the time if you did that. - Shh, fuckin' shut up! - I had to walk home alone, I was fuckin' scared! - I'm sorry. - Don't do it again. (ambient music) (thunder rumbling) (birds chirping) (ambient music) (Pete crying) (slow paced music) (light humming) (sirens wailing) - Uniform coppers? - [Pete] No, they're undercover, and they're always there. In the shops, when I'm walking down the street. They know what I'm doing. I feel like they can read my fucking mind. And I just wanna lay low. - I think you're fucking paranoid. I think you're taking more than you're selling and you're treating it like this is some kind of party Pete. This is a fucking business! I thought we were mates. - Yeah, we are mates, Steve. - Sorry, I forgot this is how you treat your mates. You still fucking Jerry's girlfriend? - I just wish none of this had ever happened. Gary Kenwood. Everything. Maybe I am paranoid, but everywhere I look I see cops. - Does anyone else know what happened besides you, me and Cheryl? - [Pete] No. - Did you tell Jerry? - No, I haven't told no one. - Ah fuck, now you're making me paranoid. If you thought the fuckin' cops were following you, what the fuck did you come here for? I thinks it's best to, lay low for a while. Just let things settle down. What are you going to do? - Jerry said he'd help me out with a few things. - [Woman] One Jumbo Yumbo burger with chilli. - How's it going? Getting the hang of it? - Yeah, sort of. (machine beeping) You put up with this shit every week and this is all you get? - Yeah. Don't expect to get to like it, you never like it, you just take the money and run. - At least they put it in the bank for ya. - Yeah. (slow paced music) You know it's not just about fucking her anymore. It's like we're more connected than that. She's like my best friend. Remember when you and me wrote that stuff in the cubby-house? With our blood? That's how I feel about her. I know you and me will always be there for each other, and now I want to be there for her too. Do you know what I mean? - Sure do. (heavy breathing) He could come out any minute you know. - I gotta tell him. - He just got me this job. - Well, I don't know what to do Pete. I don't wanna keep doing this. - Neither do I. - You hungry? - [Man] You got any on you, man? - You got the wrong guy mate. - Do you wanna eat something? - No I don't feel like it. - Yeah. Not hungry? Let's go eat something. - No. - Come on. - So, what are we fucking doing then? - Come on hun. - [Cheryl] No, come on Jerry, I'm not going down in there. - Come on, let's go see where they killed the bastard. - No, I'm fucking scared. - I don't wanna go down there either man. - Awe Pete, he might've left some of the money he owes ya! (everyone laughing) Come on. Babe. - [Stacey] Come on! - [Angelo] There it is. - Hey, do you reckon this place is haunted? - Probably is now. Better stay close to me in case something happens! - You dirty prick! Get off me! (Angelo growls) Fuck off! - [Angelo] I thought all the rain would've washed this shit away by now. - No, it's got to flood before it fills up. - Man what if the cops see us down here? They'll think we had something to do with this shit. - Relax Pete, we'd be gone before they even knew we were here. Why do you reckon they killed him? Do you reckon he owed them money, too? (everyone laughing) - Yeah probably. But they probably didn't mean to kill him, y'know? - I heard they bashed his head in with an iron bar. I don't think they were fucking around mate. - Fuck, is that blood? - [Angelo] Looks like it. (Jerry screams) - Fuck! (Jerry laughing) - [Stacey] That's not funny you fucking idiot! - Ooh. Shit Pete, I wish it was me. We would've made short work of that prick, hey? - Yeah, yeah, we would've. - Fuck this, I'm going. - No, no, come on Cheryl. It's not that bad. Come on, let's get pissed. Hey babe, let's play some charades, who am I? (Jerry imitates punches) (Jerry crying) (Jerry laughing) - [Kenwood] Fuck you! Please! I'll get you the fuckin' money. Please Mister Simpson! - I want to get as pissed as I've ever been. Let's just keep drinking forever Cheryl. Hey? Fuck, I hate the chicken shop! I just want to party! I fuckin' hate chickens. I want to fuckin' fly away. - Chickens can't fly Jerry. - Yeah, yeah. - Don't, don't. Fuck off. - Yeah? (Jerry chuckles) (Jerry imitates clucking) - Jerry, do you reckon there's a light at the end of this fucking tunnel? (Jerry laughing) - Nah. There's a fucking chicken shop with a drive-thru and fuckin' dickheads ordering Hawaiian packs. (Jerry laughing) (glass shatters) - [Cheryl] What fuck did you do that for? - Fun. - Yeah, that's real fucking exciting Jerry. Real fucking exciting! - Yeah, well you wouldn't know what fun is. Stupid bitch. - Yeah well neither would you, because you're at fuckin' work all the time. Piss off, Stace. - Piss off then. [Jerry] Get some more piss then! - Fuck you! - Should I... - No, I'll go get her man. (Jerry chuckles) Cheryl! Cheryl wait! - [Cheryl] Piss off! - [Pete] He didn't mean it, okay! He's just pissed! - Well then he shouldn't fucking drink! - Fuck, oi! Come back hey, we'll go somewhere else. - How do you think I feel with you and Jerry there? I feel like a slut. - What do you want me to say? - I'm pregnant Pete. - Why are you telling me? - Why do you think? I don't know if it's yours or if it's Jerry's. - [Pete] Isn't there some sort of test they can do? (face slaps) - I fuckin' hate girls who get pregnant, I don't want this! I fuckin'... - Hey, you're not gonna tell him are ya? Hey, you gonna tell him? You gonna tell him? - Well are you gonna tell him? - Jerry'd be better at this sort of thing than me alright? He's got a good job. Cheryl, I don't know how long I can handle it there Cheryl. - I never said I was gonna have the thing, did I? Nah, I've got plans for my life Pete, I'm not gonna be stuck here with a kid! - I can give you the money. (Cheryl scoffs) - I wouldn't want to put you out. - You wouldn't be putting me out Cheryl, you can give me the money back when you could afford it. What? I said I'd give you the money. - Fuck you! (ominous music) - Can you imagine owning this place? You'd feel like a king wouldn't you? You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm a company man. - I'm not a company man. - Yeah you are. (Pete gagging) (Pete spits) What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey, hey Breeanna. Hey Pete! Now come on. - I'm going home. - Breeanna! - [Todd] Breeanna, that's got a spit in it! - I thought you said that kid was a good worker? - Pete! - The bloke across the hall said the fuckin' cops were in the building the other day asking fuckin' questions about Kenwood! I'm out of here Pete. - [Pete] What kind of things were they asking? - I don't fuckin' know, but I'm not sticking around to find out! Who'd you fuckin' tell? - No one. No one. - Fuck. - [Steve] Cops reckon it's drug related. Reckons they found some fuckin' empty satchels in the canals. Maybe you were right, maybe you were seeing fucking maggots! - Where are you gonna go? - Fuckin' away man! The fuckin' cops are on the case, mate, and they're not gonna catch me! And you better watch your ass or they'll fuckin' do you too Pete! - Well how long you going for? - I'm not coming back mate. You want some more dope do you? - I just need some cash. - You can have it, I was gonna flush it anyway. - You were gonna flush it? - There's plenty of fuckin' drugs where I'm heading, man. - You sure you don't want any money for this Steve? - When you leave, just make sure you go out the back will ya. (tense music) - I don't want to know about this stuff with Kenwood, Pete. I'm tryin' to get my shit together now, man. Don't even want to know about it. - Man, I don't know who to talk to but. Come on! - Things have changed, man. When the insurance comes through, Kylie and I, we're gonna get a place together, get it specially built with ramps and shit. I don't want to risk any of that man, not even by knowing stuff. - Man, I reckon you've looped the fuckin' loop. I reckon that crash took more than your fuckin' legs. It took something from up here. I didn't come here because I wanted anything, I came here 'cause you're my friend. Huh? - I don't want to see you again Pete. Please don't come back here again. (tense music) (slow paced music) (light humming) - What happened? - You tell me. Jerry comes home from work early, he was using choice language. - Yelling and screaming like a bloody idiot! - He comes out here, sets it alight, and then he left! What's going on Pete? Where are you going? Do you know where Jerry is? - [Doug] Jesus Christ Jean, I don't know where you went wrong with them fucking kids! - [Todd] Hey Roger, there's that guy that spat in the Hawaiian pack! - You come here again mate, I'm calling the cops! - Fuckin' get your hands off me! Where's my cousin? - [Manager] He's gone mate, just like you. - You're a loser mate! You'll never be a company man! - Yeah, yeah, fuckin' Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Hey, go shove a drumstick up your ass! Hey Jerry! Jerry! Where you going man? (music rumbling) (solemn music) - I did it. - What? - I'm the one who killed Kenwood, Jerry. - Did you mean to? - No. And you know what? Even though I hated that prick and I wanted him dead, now that he is I wish he wasn't. I even miss him, not like a friend or anything, just, he's not there to hate anymore. I reckon you need people to hate just like you need people to love. It sort of works out, doesn't it? (both chuckle) - You shouldn't have spat in the food. If you didn't want the job, you should've just walked out. They were gonna call the cops on you. I talked them out of it. And then the manager said I had a, what the fuck. What the fuck did he call it? Conflict of interest, and he was gonna sack me. But fuck it, I got in first, I said "You can shove your fucking job!" - I didn't mean for you to lose your job Jerry. - Then I went to see Cheryl, you know, I just wanted to see her. And she tells me she's pregnant, and I got this amazing wave of happiness over me, like the fuckin' job's nothing. I felt so good. I never felt that good before. But she wasn't smiling, so I asked her what's wrong and she started crying. And she said I was too good for her. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Having a job? How the fuck am I supposed to make it if I don't have a job? Then she tells me that she doesn't think the kid is mine. - What? - She thinks it might be yours. (heavy breathing) I burnt the cubby-house down. All it was good for. Now I've got no job, they won't give me the fuckin' dole, and my girlfriend's having a kid to my best mate. I don't know what I did wrong. - Do you want to hit me? - No. How could I hit you? You're my fuckin' best friend. - Come on Jerry, fuckin' hit me man. Just fuckin' hit me... - Just piss off Pete! - Fuck. Just hit me, fuck it. Fuckin' hit me man. Fuckin' hit me Jerry. Fuckin' hit me Jerry! I fuckin' deserve it! - Leave me alone Pete. - [Pete] Hit me Jerry. Just fuckin' hit me. Hit me. - [Jerry] Leave me alone. - You fuckin' knew I liked Cheryl. I fuckin' liked her before you did! (face punches) (Pete spits) (heavy breathing) I'm sorry. - Yeah, so am I. (tense music) Hello, is that the police? Yeah, I got some information for you. You're still looking for who killed that Gary Kenwood guy? Well I know who did it. I did. My name's Jerry Rawson. I'm at the railway station. (slow gentle humming) - Jerry! Jerry, no! (train whistle blowing) Jerry! No! (train screeching) (Jean crying) - [Jean] No! (Jean screaming) (camera shutters) (kids laughing) (people chattering) - Hey. - [Man] What are friends for? - It's kicking. I found out it's a boy. - What are you gonna call it? - Got any ideas?
