Wonder what's going on? Here comes C.B.S. News. Must be important. Unit 2473 to helicopter. Helicopter. Over. Have you located suspect? Suspect under surveillance. Helicopter to 2473. Suspect stopped. He can't get away. Over. All right. All right. Maintain surveillance. Kowalski... and the keys for a sawed-off weekend. Well, you're both welcome. - What do you got going for Frisco? - You're not going back tonight. Hey, you're gonna kill yourself someday, you know that? - Do ya know? - Yeah. Yeah. Look. W-Why don't you stay over till Monday, huh? So you can go home right now. Oh, yeah. Sure, sure. Just before midnight. Hey, look, you know something? When the clock strikes 12:00, my car turns into a pumpkin. Hey, Sandy, you're a born actor. Yeah. Sure, sure. That's what my wife will say... when I tell her I've been waiting up for you all night. Hey, look, look. Look, seriously, look, why don't you stay over? - Nah. - Huh? Look, you can do with some sleep, can't ya? Look, I gotta get started out tonight. Now, which car? Which- Hey, "K!" What's happenin'? - What ya need? - Speed. White lightnin'! Hold this. - How you doin'? - I'm fine. How you been? - Lookin' good. Say when. - Whoa, whoa. - That's good. That's good. - Mm-hmm. - Hey, man. Hold it. I'll get you some water. - Mm-mmm. - That's okay. Forget it. Yeah. I'm gonna split. - You sure? - Hang out for a while. - Uh-uh-uh. - I gotta get moving. - "Gotta get movin'. Gotta hit the road." Bullshit. What about them two chicks over there to slow you down, huh? Yeah. They're beautiful. So drop out and join the cause. Look, no offense, Jake, but I gotta be in Frisco 3:00 tomorrow afternoon. - Ahh! You puttin' me on, right? - I wish to God I was. Well, then you bullshittin' yourself, because you cannot make it. - You wanna bet? - Well, this must be a souped-up somethin'. - Yeah. It's hopped up to over 160. - Whoo! But even so- I tell you what. I'm gonna bet you the tab for the bennies. I'm gonna be in Frisco, I'm gonna call you 3:00 tomorrow afternoon. Now, if I don't, double the deal the next time around. - Bet? - Bet. Good luck, whitey! There have been genetic studies on beef cattle. There has been concern the degree of heritability... of economically important traits such as rate of growth... meat conversion and carcass quality. Thin breeds, and in many cases Herefords... they have been selected for these traits. Findings have shown generally that such traits are highly heritable. This is consistent with similar studies... conducted elsewhere around the country. On the other hand, some other traits... such as fertility and calf-survival rate- low inheritability. Heterosis, or hybrid vigor... may be an important factor in these latter traits... and the crossing of genetic unlikes... produces heterosis for best crossbreeding. So just a few views of what's to come... of what will be seen in crossbreeding... from today's Farm Report. - Ten seconds, Super. - You got it. - Aaah! Good morning, folks! This is yours truly, Super, Super Soul. Direct and live with no net, early people. Without a net! Transmittin' from KOW, spelt K-O-W. Uh-huh. The noisiest, bounciest, fanciest radio station... in the Far West! Now let's cheer up the morning with some wham-bam, zoom-boom, wake-up music... with a little help from my friend. Now take it away, amigo. Hey! Get it! All right! Hubba hubba! Bring it on home! We got a long way to go today, baby. Hey! Come on! Pull over! Wake up now! Hey! Pull over! Pull over! You son of a bitch! There's a lot of traffic moving through there. I can't see too well. One rider is up, moving to his bike. There is a yellow flag in this race. All riders will hold their positions. Kowalski also is up and moving to his bike, and he's firing it up... and he's back in this race. - You okay? - I'm okay! Get him! Get him! And now, crashing into the top ten... comes the first really monstrous hit of the '70s. A number that all by itself jumped 29- 29 places in one week! Uh-huh! There's absolutely no doubt whatsoever, as they say... that this will be next week's number one! Numero uno, baby! The itchy bang entitled "Where Do You Go From Here, Baby?" by Brian O'Brian. Sock it to 'em, Brian, baby! All right! Let's get to it! - Yeah! - Tell it to me! Talk to me now! - Oh! Speak to me! - All right! 123, what's your location? Uh, we've been in a two-bike pileup on 53. - 10-4. How far out are you? - About five miles from Thompson. - Can you give me a description on the car? - 1970 white Challenger. Colorado license O-A-5-5-9-9. - 10-4. Was anybody injured? - No injuries. - 10-4. Return to your station then. - Okay. Uh, we're on our way in, but you best send a truck for that other motorcycle. Hey, Supe. Pick up on this, man. "Attention, all highway patrol stations. Suspect vehicle 1970 Dodge Challenger, white in color." Number 71 just crashed into number 63! It's a pileup! Eight cars, nine cars! Gasoline on the infield! Plenty of cars who were- Oh, my God! It's number three! Kowalski! He's in a roll! Look at him, landing on the roof of the car... coming to a rest on the east end of the field. Greetings, Sir. Let's race. Ya got any balls in that mother? Whoop! Sayonara! You bastard. - Car 24 to Headquarters. Car 24 to Headquarters. - Come in, Car 24. Yeah. We lost him at the Nevada border. We better let Nevada handle it. This guy's nuts. 10-4. Will advise Nevada Highway Patrol. Yeah. I got it, all right. Initials O-A-5-5-9-9. Colorado plates. Now, what's this roadrunner done, fellers? Hey, Supe. I got them on the air now. Yeah, quite a mother, but, uh, well, fellas... as you know, we can't throw anything at him... except, uh, dangerous driving and failure to stop- misdemeanors, both of'em, over here. Yeah. You told me that once, comrade. But has this bronco in the Jaguar filed a formal complaint? - No, he hasn't. - Well, there you are. That isn't even a felony, brother. - What are you guys gonna do? - He hasn't got us bugged any. He's the one that's gonna have to start worrying as of right now. - Hmm. Good luck. - Yeah. Don't you worry. We'll catch him. May I help you, sir? May I help you? - Yeah. Fill her up, please. - Thank you, sir. Come on, will ya? Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you. - Come on, baby. You play ball with me, I'll let you go, huh? All right. Come on. Tell me. Where'd you get the stuff? Huh? Which house? - Come on. Come on. Jesus. Get outta here. Get out of here. Go. And there goes the Challenger... being chased by the blue, blue meanies on wheels. The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver... the last American hero- the electric centaur, the demigod... the super driver of the golden West. Two nasty nazi cars are close behind the beautiful lone driver. The police numbers are gettin' closer, closer... closer to our soul hero in his soul-mobile. Yeah, baby. They about to strike. They gonna get him, smash him... rape... the last beautiful free soul... on this planet. But... it is written... "If the evil spirit arms a tiger with claws... Brahman provideth wings for the dove." Thus spake the super guru. - Did you hear that? - Yep. Where the hell did he get so much information? Same place as you do, Charlie. You mean from our own frequency? That's right. How long's he been at it? Year and a half. Maybe two. Hell, that's against the law. So's carrying a transistor on duty. - Come on now. That's different. - But he never says anything to incriminate himself. Brains and lawyers, Charlie. As far as the law's concerned, he's clean as Kleenex. It's true. True. True. True, my friends! For by the latest information... our soul challenger has just broken the ring of evil... the deep-blue meanies have so righteously wrought! Get through 'em, baby. Get through 'em! - Friggin, faggot. Attention. Calling Car 44. Attention, Car 44. Do you read me? Gimme that. This is Car 44 reading you loud and clear. Over. Where are you, Car 44? We're on 80 some 10 miles from Argenta. Over. Well, good. Stay with it. Watch for a white Challenger, license plates initial... O-A-5-5-9-9. Colorado plates. Last seen heading for Dunphy on U.S. 40 at cruising speed. We have reason to believe that it's supercharged... so maintain double alert till you spot it... and then call in for instructions. Over and out. Let's go. Come on! Let's go! What do you think he's done? Don't know. Well, what do you think? I think he's gonna... hijack that car to Cuba. Don't be ridiculous. Hell, Charlie. I don't know. Maybe he killed somebody. Maybe he stole that big dude of his. Maybe both. Hey. What's he doing? Jesus Christ. Watch it. Watch it. Whoa! Watch it! Move over. Let me take it! Let go. Let go! I'm gonna get that son of a bitch. So help me, I'll get that son of a bitch. - Hello, Nevada. Hello, Nevada. Nevada, this is Colorado State Highway Patrol. This is about a special query raised by the Utah Highway Patrol. Affirmative. That's correct. But later they asked that the information... be forwarded to you guys, so get ready for some details. Turn on your tape recorders and all that sorta jazz, huh? Apparently, this speed maniac you've been chasing all over your territory... is a former professional road racer named Kowalski. K-O-W-A-L-S-K-I. Repeat. Kowalski. First name unknown. Other particulars also unknown. All we do know is that he's employed... as a car delivery driver by an agency in Denver. He's presently driving a Dodge Challenger... Colorado license plate O-A-5-5-9-9. This is not a stolen car. He's driving it to San Francisco for delivery due Monday. It's only Saturday. What's his hurry? That's what we wanted to know ourselves... so your guess is as good as ours. 10-4. - You all right? - Yeah. Forty-four to Headquarters. Forty-four to Headquarters. - Come in, 44. - He's on his way. I lost him. - What? What the hell's goin' on out there, Collins? - Headin' for Twin Falls. - He creamed my car. - What's the matter with you? You gone crazy? Correction. We're still after him. We haven't lost him. - We're still after him. Now, come on! - Stay right where you are. We're coming to you right now. Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Give me that. - Car 44 to Headquarters. - Come in, 44. He's jumped the main road and headed out into the desert. Let him cook out there for a while. He ain't going nowhere. What's he trying to prove now? - Any time now, Super. - Yeah. Run a tape. I already ran a tape twice. Come on, man! Are you blind or somethin'? Can't you see I'm thinkin'? Crazy- Kowalski. Kowalski, can you hear me? Do you hear me, Kowalski? Now, I know you can hear me, Kowalski. I'm sure you hear me now, this very minute. Now, you listen very carefully. The whole mobile force of the Nevada State Highway Patrol is after you. They waitin' for you to come up for air. Yeah. Now some people imagine... you'll try to get to California through Death Valley. And others bet you'll die there in the desert. These few are just too happy to see you vanish for good out there. But my tape deck is just as jammed with telegrams... as my head is jammed with phone calls... from people who are wishing you well in your getaway... no matter where it might lead you. I wish I could help you, but I can't. I can't. I don't think anybody can, except for that crazy lucky streak of yours. And now you gonna need more luck- all of it, perhaps, and badly. You can beat the police, you can beat the road... and you can even beat the clock... but you can't beat the desert. Nobody can. You just cannot- - Go to hell. Wait. I love you. Wouldn't it be funny after all if you did have to arrest me? I mean, me trying to turn you on... and you trying to turn me in. I love this. I love your scar. You hate it, but I love it. No, I don't hate it. I just hate what it means. What does it mean? Only if you make war on war will you overcome it. I love you. I love you. Mmm. You're crazy- surfing in the middle of winter. I'm going out again. Maybe I'll catch an eight-footer. I'll ride it in your honor. Sayonara. Remember me. Here we are at point zero where the Kowalski saga began. And to be interviewed by K.L.Z. TV News... is the owner of the agency, Mr. Holly Mekas... and one of the attendants, Sandy McKees. Sandy, uh, you knew this man best. - What do you think of Kowalski? - Well, he's a great driver. Sir, what? What did you say? - I said he's a great driver. - Great driver. We all knew that. - You won't find a driver like him on the road every day. - But as a professional driver... he never really made the grade, did he? You know why? He never really wanted to. So far as I'm concerned, he was number one then and he's number one now. - Can't find a driver with his potential. Why don't they let him alone? Let the guy alone! Look, he never done any harm! This is Bob Bolmer, K.L.Z. TV News in Denver. Super Soul needs no introduction as our number-one disc jockey. But he's certainly on his way to becoming a national celebrity in his own right... as the invisible guide of Kowalski. - Blind leading the blind. - As you all remember... Kowalski was involved in a cross-country chase starting in Denver, Colorado. Stay right where you are, son. Don't move, stranger. Don't move. I'll get him for you. I'll get him. I'll get him. Stick your pretty little head right through there, baby. That's it. Now we got him. Now we'll get our basket over here. Look at that. Live and wigglin'. Yeah. Ain't that a beauty? Ohh. Ain't that a fat one, though? Now we'll get him in here. Thank you, son. - That's got him. - Thank you. How many do you have in there? Got six rattlers, two sidewinders... and now we've got one very precious diamondback. What do you do with those things? Trade 'em. Trade 'em for coffee, sugar... chewing tobacco, salt, flour and beans- and lots of beans, son. You live out here, huh? Look, I'm lost and I need your help. Attention, Kowalski. I've got an important message for you. Kowalski, are you listening? Now dig this. Coppers from the highway patrol... are combing the desert hunting for you. Listen carefully. Believe it or not, they trying to help you. They really are. Dig it? That depends, son. - What? - You said you needed my help. So that depends on your helping me first. Helping me to get to where it was that- to get where it was that I was headed for. One of them is a- is a-comin' on now. I can't see a damn thing out there. I bet you can't even see my truck neither, and that's... Just over there. Let's get the hell outta here, huh? No, no, that ain't any way to do it. That's no way to- to get the hell out. No, the best way, to my knowledge, to get away... is to root right in where you are, just root right in. He just went over, yeah. But stay put. Tracks. Let's go down and take a look. He must have found my old truck. He's circlin' it, yeah. There's a truck. That's a derelict. Probably been there since the depression. - He's headin' north. Okay. - Where to now? - Straight ahead. - Okay. - Take it easy. "Name: Kowalski. "K-O-W-A-L-S-K-I. Christian name-" Christian name, my flat foot. What is that? - What is that? - Faith healers. Don't you come any closer. You just wait for me right here in this automobile. - You hear me? - Okay. 'Cause them healers don't like strangers much. Especially that deacon Jesse Hovah. He's a- He's a mean one. - And don't forget about the gas. - I ain't forgettin' the gas. - You're late. - Mr. Hovah, my truck broke down. Who is that man over there? Just like I was tellin' you, my truck... she ain't gettin' any younger now, and- Who is that man? - He's a friend. - A friend, eh? How do you know? - Ain't that a pretty one, though? Ain't that real pretty? Yeah. But we don't need him anymore. Look, I told you' these meetings are private. Why did you bring a stranger? Mr. Hovah, I didn't bring him. He brought me over. Why? Well, he needs some gas. Gas. Hmm. Just take your gas and take him out of here. But, Mr. Hovah... ain't you gonna give me my coffee and sugar and all the- Yeah, you'll get it. And all the stuff that you promised me? You'll get it. We just don't need the snakes anymore. We got the music. So... we are going to... free the vipers! - Think she's pretty much filled up now. - Yeah. Well' you can leave now, son. How? Well, just follow the Larrea Belt. The what belt? The Larrea Belt. Always keep your eye on the trail of the sun. - Never lose your shadow. Then when you see very tall saguaro cactuses, don't lose them neither... 'cause that's the Larrea Belt. The saguaro and a creosote tree'll take you right back... onto the trail of the earth. Mm-hmm. So, th-that's the road? That's the road, yeah. You're beginning to get the fundamentals of it, son. Maybe. Well, thanks, Pa. Thanks for everything. You're very welcome. Hope I'll be seeing you again. Vaya con Dios. "Enlisted U.S. Army, 1960. "Service in Vietnam war. "Wounded, Mekong Delta.

I'll tell you when I'm ready. Goodness sakes. Well, come on. I'm coming. Push it. I am pushing. There's a car coming. Going our way? Be back in a second. Okay, let's push her off the road. Oh, what a relief! Yes, thank you. You're very kind. You're welcome. Uh, pardon me, but could you please tell us which direction you're headed? I'm going to Frisco. Oh, well, that's perfect. Thank you. Is something wrong? No. Why? Should there be? Well, you're so silent... and moody. Maybe it's just part of my nature. Why are you laughing? I'm not laughing. Yes, you are. Way down deep inside yourself. It's because you think we're queers... isn't it? Hey- This is a stickup. Stickup? Why are you laughing, Mary? Well, tell me. Tell me! Hey! No! No, please! It hurts! Oh, my head! Ohh! You bitch. Hey, Brother K. - Hi. - Welcome back. - How you feelin'? - Tired. Oh, I bet you're tired. Well' you wanna know what's happenin'? Yeah. What's happening? Big Brother's not so much watching as listening in... as you well might have gathered by now. But what you probably don't know is that they found these two... let us say' gentlemen on the road. They was pretty badly battered up. Yeah, they must have had an accident or something like that. But some smart-ass was puttin' the pressure on them to charge you... with some ugly, nasty crime. Let us say assault and battery. But the two gents in question refused to comply. Or as my alter ego might put it... stickin' to they guns. Now listen to this. Some party or parties... are busily preparing a little welcome committee... in the sunshine state... and the main doors, and even some side doors... are heavily embellished with garlands and fuzzy frills. You know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean. Hang on now, brother. Hang on. All right, everybody, clear the streets and you won't get hurt. Hey! Hey, nigger! - Hey, loudmouthed nigger! I'm gonna shut your big, black mouth. Let's get him! Kowalski! Hi! Hey. - Hey, you need any help? - No, thanks. - You sure? - I'm sure. Far out, man. - Hey, wait a second. - What? You got any ups? - You mean speed? - Yeah. Yeah, I got some back at the place. How far is it? About a mile. Okay? Wanna go back? Far out. Thanks. - You want more water? - That's okay. Keep these. I got a whole bunch. Oh, no, no. I can't use all of that. Well, take what you need. - Thanks. - All right. Person-to-person call for Kowalski. Person-to-person call for Kowalski. Can you hear me, Kowalski? This is to inform you of the latest developments. Correction to my last delivery. All the main doors are closed... except one. - This one opens to Sonora. - Oh, far out, man. - That's just a couple minutes up the road. You're gonna make it, Kowalski. Yeah. The last chance. - Or some oasis around there. - Hey, are you, uh- are you familiar with this jock's voice? - Now all you super people on the super highways... - Super Soul? Yeah. Why? And byways and freeways- - I don't know. - I said freeways- That's Super Soul. - If any of you should spot our hero out there... - Maybe he's got a cold. - But that's his voice. - Help the man. - You really think so, huh? - Cheer him on. - Let us know where he is... - Wait a minute. - So that I can personally deliver your message... - Hey! - Of good will to our superhero. - Come here! Are you listening, K? - Come on! - We're gonna help you. Dig it. All of us. - Yeah. - Listen to this. So, friends, call me. - Yeah? - Yours Truly, Super Soul... - Whose voice is that? - Right here at KOW... - It's Super Soul. Who else? - You sure? - The noisiest, fanciest station in the far west... - You absolutely sure? - Right here in eautil, uptight, downtown Goldfield. - Well, hang on a minute. And Brother K, just keep the faith in us, baby... and we'll lead you right on... to glory. Yeah, it sounds a little different. He sounds kind of stiff or square. He sounds a little mechanical. You sense a trap, man? Yeah, maybe. Wait here till I get back. Where you going? Just wait here. You gonna stay with us? No. No, I don't think so. Is there something I can do for you? - Like what? - Like anything you want. No, I can't think of anything. You don't fancy me. Oh, yeah, yeah. Very much. Then why don't we have some fun? Thanks. Thanks just the same. That's okay. Isn't there something you'd like? Yeah. Yeah, how about a smoke? Oh. Okay. I'll roll you one. No, no, no. A straight one. Yeah. All right. Here. - Keep the pack. - Thanks. You know' you haven't changed much. Hmm? I said you haven't changed much. Haven't I? Here. That was a long time ago. I know. I pasted it up when it first came out. When I cut it out, I- It's a lot like shootin' jackrabbits, ain't it? Mm. God damn it's hot. I know that. - You were right, man. He sold you out. More cops than I ever seen, man. You were sold out. - What the hell's that for? - That's your pig pass. I figure I'd trade in the truck for the station wagon. It's police! Clear the road! Clear the road! Get those cars outta here! Get those cars back! That's him! Get those cars outta here! Get after him! Get after him! Get those cars outta here! - Move! Move! Move! Goddamn! Hey, that's my car! This is California. We don't call them mothers or speed freaks around here... but we're gonna do what you haven't been able to do. We're gonna stop him for good. Yes, we've been previously informed of all that. Thank you, Nevada. Well, you don't need me anymore. You're in California. You're almost home. - Can you make it on that? - You bet your ass, baby. You take care, Kowalski. Hey, K. I knew you wouldn't make it. "What's happenin"'? You happenin', man. You're all over the front page. Here's the headline: "Ex-Race Driver Involved In Massive Police Chase." Yeah, they even printed poor Vera's story, plus her picture. You out there drivin' like a wild man. You know you gon' lose your gig. It's not your car anyw- What you tryin' to prove? Are you high, or what? Hey, K, you still there? Look'just tell Sandy not to worry. I'm okay, and that car's gonna be delivered Monday, right on time. You're gassed, man. No incidents. But it's double the bet next time around, huh? Hey, man. Don't do no silly shit out there. Okay? - Take care of yourself. - Okay. I'll see you, amigo. I am heading for Frisco. Where? San Francisco. You... have been waiting a long time? I don't really feel I being social tonight. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. Honestly. Do you mind? Have your dreams. What's happened? I don't know. Why we stop? I'm getting stoned. Mmh feels nice in here. Yeah What are you? A delivery driver. Or Scorpio? Yeah. What's your name? Kowalski. Ku wa lski! Cowalsky Yeah Kowalski. First, last and only. Funny Very, and what's yours? I'll tell you later When? When we get to Frisco? Why are you going to San Francisco? It's home. Home... You make it sound like a good place. I like you Kowalski. I like you. I've been waiting for you for a long time. Oh how I've waited for you. Yes? Since when, and where? Oh everywhere. Everywhere and since forever. Patiently Patiently... That's the only way to wait for somebody. Ten seconds, super. - Ohhhh, lordy! Good mornin' to all you folks out there. Sunday morning here with all men of good will... and some of evil will thrown in for good measure. All peace-lovin' Christians... gettin' ready to go to church this mornin'. And here I am, yours truly- yeah, Super Soul- bantering a stream of unconsciousness... and peddlin' these labels for the sake of good music... to all you listeners out there! But I'm here on Sunday for the first time in my life... and for the very first time this KOW radio station begins... not only to deejay and to do my own thing... but to tell you a little story. Now, let's start at the beginning. But before we start, here's some early Sunday morning wake-up music! - Take it away, baby! - We are live out there! - Right on! And today... in a beautiful gesture made by beautiful people... of beautiful downtown Goldfield... This radio station was named Kowalski... in honor of the last American hero... to whom speed means freedom of the soul. The question is not when he's gon' stop... but who is gonna stop him. Hello, Kowalski. Kowalski. Please listen, Kowalski. It's useless. Cut it off, man. Stop!
