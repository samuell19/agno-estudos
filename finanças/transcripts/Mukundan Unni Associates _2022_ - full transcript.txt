WILL KILL YOU! Scram, you pussycat! Full screen! Never mind. For now, this much is fine! This is the earth. This is a Benz car. And this is me, Advocate Mukundan Unni from Kalpatta. My biggest dream is to be successful before I turn 30. One needs four factors to succeed in life: hard work, dedication, perseverance and discipline. I have them all. But so far, I couldn't be successful in my life. Still, every morning I wake up precisely at 6 o'clock. After the morning ablutions, I stretch, do push-ups, wear glasses, make the bed, wash the clothes, fold them neatly, and wipe my 2012 model second-hand bike clean. But I am turning 36 this month. So, as usual, I will open a copy of my Aadhaar card in the photoshop and edit my year of birth. Iâ€™ve been 29 years old for the past seven years Only the government authorities, my mother and I know this truth. But this cannot be carried forward for much longer. My face has started showing signs of aging. At any cost, I need to be successful this year. Because I deserve a good life... with lots of happiness. Lots! A file of mine is there in your bag, along with Moosakka's documents. Can you check it once? And then come to MLA Reshma George's house urgently. Reshma George, MLA She has caught up in a case creating a stir and is now in a situation where she might even lose her MLA post. What if we go for an appeal in the high court? Any chance of winning? No chance! Though, there's a chance to rain today! Her husband and former minister, George Illikal, looks after all her affairs. My senior lawyer, Gangadharan, is dealing with this case for them. Let me see. Yes, this is it! Okay! But she needs a much better lawyer. One like me! No! That should be me! Extremely good-looking and intelligent. I should impress her! "Court finds Reshma George guilty: MLA will resign." Seeing George Illikkal panic like this, one would mistake him for the MLA. Ah! It's a bit different in this one. "The court issued the verdict: Reshma George needs to resign." -But look at the MLA. -Thank you, Madam. She is so calm and peaceful. But she is not the deciding authority here. Are you both his juniors? I should impress him, not her. Sir, my house is next to your hospital in Kalpatta. So what?! What was the judge's name? -What's his name? -Sangameswaran. Sir, what if the Bishop talks to him for us? Chakkappa, the court order is already issued! Need to settle this mess before the elections. Won't you go to Moosakka's house? Get his sign on the affidavit and come straight to the office. What? Do you really think that Adv Gangadharan can win this trial? As far as Adv Gangadharan is concerned, this is only one of his several cases. But it won't be the case for me. This would be my first independent case. More than you, I would crave MLA's win in it. We've already hired a lawyer for this case. Sir, If we prove this order is bogus, we can get the stay order from the high court. Chakkappa, get the car. Simply wasting my time! Sir, we can create two copies of the judgement on the judge's laptop. One would state the MLA as guilty and the other innocent. Then, with your political influence, we will make the high court registrar inspect the laptop. If two different judgments for the same case are obtained from the judge's laptop, the order can be proven to be fake. Reshma George's downfall is entirely on this beardo who lacks the common sense to understand such a clever idea. Chakkappa, let's go. Poor lady! She needs to know this! Madam, Adv Mukundanunni here. I am not saying this as a lawyer but as a representative of a majority of people. You ought to be a bit more independent, Madam. Please stop being a mere puppet in your husband's hands. This is 2021. Women should be empowered. We need more empowered women leaders in a chauvinistic state like Kerala. -Eh?! -Sir, please... After all, what was the need?! Did he pay the fees last time? No, right? Madam, when can we file the appeal? Let's file it next week. Madam, you asked me to come today. Reshma George has seen my message. But why no reply? Why is she not replying? Where were you?! Gangadharan sir is looking for you. Sir, looking at our points, it is less likely for our client to get bail. So, it would be better if you could appear for the next hearing. C'mon, Jomi! Never has Advocate Gangadharan appeared for a trial that he might likely lose. Be his guest and appear for the case yourself, Jomi! No, it's alright. You may appear, Jomi. Okay, sir. Got the affidavit signed? Yeah. Who the hell are you to advise the MLA? Advise?! -Advise?! I didn't get it, sir-- -Hey, Mathews... Settle him with his pending dues, if any. You are fired. That was quick and unexpected! Almost tragic! But from another angle, it's cool. How long will I goof around that old geezer hoping to get a case?! I've spoiled so many of my years associating with several people. I've no more time to spare. Not even a moment! And so the earth continued to spin for another 30 days without a pause. So did I! Every morning, I got up at 6 o'clock and wore a pressed shirt, watch and shoes and kept roaming around, seeking a case. The preponderance of probability is somewhat weak in this case. We can go for interlocutory proceedings, get interrogatories and try for judgement. If that doesn't work out, we can try a garnishee order. Please sign on this vakalat. -That's not it. -Oh, don't get scared! Aunty, this is just a plenipotentiary procedure. No, that's not the case. My daughter came yesterday. She looked at your profile and since you don't have enough experience, she arranged a new lawyer. I came to inform you that. Please don't feel bad. You could have informed me over the phone. I tried but couldn't reach you. That's why I came in person. It's been a month after I left that old geezer, Gangadharan! Couldn't grab a single case! How did it go? 'We won't give you the case. Don't call me again.' My future looks bleak! On top of that, Robin is creeping me out, advising! What's up with Panikkar sir's case? Shouldn't we file it in the consumer court? Even that didn't work out? Give up all these and join me. Join him?! Really?! Long odds! -This has turned cold coffee! -Oh, no! -Get two cups of fresh tea. -Okay. Make it three. What's up, advocate?! You travel all the way from there every week! Will you win any of these cases? If it is a winnable case, he wouldn't have let me appear for it! It's cool, even if you lose the trial. It's a win-win as you both can meet up at the company's expense. Don't overdo it! See, your clients are here. Grab them! Can't you wash that coat once in a while? It stinks like dead fish! See, Jyothi, I'm an independent lawyer, not anyone's assistant. So, please respect my authority. No. He's not an assistant but a petty lawyer! A petty lawyer who earns barely 800 rupees after working hard all day in his stained pants, shirt and messy hair. Here you go. Where should I remit this? I cleared LLB not to become a petty lawyer! I have dreams. Anchor (ON TV): The Judge, R Sangameswaran, who issued the verdict in the case against former MLA Reshma George, has been transferred. Sangameswaran, the CJM, has been transferred to Kalpatta Motor Accident Claim Tribunal. The opposition leader alleged that there was a ruling government conspiracy behind this. KNP Party President Rajeevan stated that the party would look for new candidates in the upcoming election. He added that those convicted in corruption cases will not be spared. Oh-no! Unni... A snake! oh-no! Snake! Wow! A magnificent serpent capable of killing 20 people with a single bite! The classic cobra! Charismatic, elegant and dangerous! Unni... oh-no! M... my leg! Hey, man! What happened to Mom? She fell and fractured her leg. Twenty. You should pay 50000 rupees before the surgery. Do I need to pay the total amount now? No, deposit 50000 now. The rest you can pay after the surgery. Huh?! Smiling at me for no reason! She's flirting with me! I should have gone to that counter to avail any discount! Didn't you go to court today? Don't you know Manoj? That fatso, who rides the bullet? His son studies at WMA or so. He asked me my gown for a play. He offered 500 rupees for it. Also, will return it washed after the programme. Hence, I gave it. Here's 7500 rupees. Sorry, no can do. You need to pay 50000 rupees now to get the surgery done. Chacko, 40 years, 85000 rupees. Won't the employees' families get a discount here? Does any of your family member work here? Meenakshi! Can I say that I am Meenakshi's family? Even so, you'll get only a 10% discount. Anyways, 7500 rupees won't do! You don't even need to count it! That's correct. Gimson, 39 years, 73000 rupees, Mani chettaa. Who's Janaki? Your mother? Were you on leave yesterday, Meenakshi? Yeah, I had a PSC examination. Are you trying to crack PSC? -Yes. -That's nice. An unwanted flirt is interrupting my flirting! Hello, I told you to change the logo! Can I get any other discount? This is not a factory outlet, but a hospital. 32 years, 53000 rupees. Is his whole family admitted in this hospital? Those are not his family members, but clients. Is he a lawyer? Not the lawyer, but his agent. Lawyer's agent! What is he doing here?! I should check this out! I pretend like I'm texting someone. -105, right? -No, 115. Fifteen? Is it an accident? It's a twisted case. -There's a fracture, right? -Yeah. How did you fall? This is really bad! What shall I say, sir. Sign here, please. What did really happen? The cow gored him when he went to milk it in the morning. Oh! -Where is the cow now? -In the cowshed. Oh! Soman, 50 years, 35000 rupees. [Mani hums an old film song] A tea, please. -Tea is on me, Mani chetta. -Eh?! Can a fall from the stairs be considered an accident? Sign here. Yeah, here. Janaki Amma, 56 years, 50000 rupees. -Venu etta. -Tell me, Mani. One more new hairline is added. Hairline?! -Did you get the wound certificate? -No, not yet received. Hand over the phone to Dr Sebatti. Show this in the pharmacy below. -Greetings, sir. -Come in. Here you go. Venu is on the line. Tell me, Venu. Doctor, mention the hairline case as multiple or compound. Last time, you mentioned 337. The insurance team narrowed it down to one lakh rupees. If you could mark it as 338, we can get a minimum of 3 lakhs. -Mani, is the patient aged? -56 years. Though she is 56, she's sound like a 30 years old. Do mention it in the report. I'll handle that. But you'll have to raise my share. Things are not as easy as it used to be. The chairman's son has returned after completing his MD. This is the car that hit your mother. KL 2 LF 3102. Note this and file a complaint with the ASI. Just tell him that agent Mani sent you there. Okay? I'll come there. Crime number 657/ 2022 16/10/2021: At 10:45 AM, Alto KL 12 F 3102, which was going towards Kanthanpara Falls from Kalpatta, via Kalpatta-Meppad road hit Janakiamma, causing her serious injuries. The driver Ratheesh Kumar who was driving the car lost control, and the vehicle hit Janakiamma. The first witness Binu Somasekaran and the second witness Jayant Vijayakumar testified that the car hit the wall on the left side. The wall on the left side! Joseph, prepare the scene statement. Okay, sir. This caucus involving cops, doctors and lawyers is more meticulous than I thought. Even the minute details in the wound certificate are carefully manipulated. I like this! We will take this wound certificate and file a case in court. Now we need a copy of the Aadhaar card, PAN card, and also a signed blank cheque. Then, if the claim is passed, the amount will be credited to your account. Then, we will debit the total amount using your blank cheque. After paying everything including your hospital bills, we will take the rest and distribute it among everyone who was a part of this. You will also get a small share. A small share! Disappointing! I am Advocate Venu O.V. If you don't mind, can you please give me your watch. Interesting personality! Jansy, mention the compensation for the watch and the glasses in the description. Okay. OPMV 831/2021, Janakiamma, Advocate Venu OV. Opposite party: Venus insurance, Advocate Vishalakshi. What Adv Venu is running here is a monopoly in a single word! He has got no opponents. Accident cases are not like civil cases or criminal cases. Here, there are no accused or punishments. After taking equal shares of the penalty amount, the petitioner, advocate, police and doctor part ways happily and peacefully. There are two types of people in this world, those who exploit and those who get exploited. I have decided to be the former. Here... -for the hospital, -Hospital. -for Dr Sebatti, -Sebatti. -for ASI, -ASI. P.C Joseph. -first witness, second witness, -Okay. for the driver and car owner. This is for you, Unni. 50000 rupees. -Alright then. -Bye. What do you do? Are you a student? No, my studies are over. Aha! What course did you study? LLB. And now? Now, I'm a practising lawyer. He's shocked! How much money do you earn on average from a single case? He trained me with an out-and-out practical session! Idiot! Now he's regretting it! Hey, are you not done? Just a minute. Yeah, you're done! Finished! Now you may leave. That's only good for you. How many juniors does he have? Is he earning enough to pay the juniors well? You don't get paid, do you? I pay them 20000 rupees per month. What else do you want to know? Thanks to you, I got all the information! You are not a mere idiot, but a blockhead! Thank you. Now, what I need is a slave! Hey, As of now, I get a petty case every two or three days. Eight hundred rupees per case, and I hardly earn about 12000 rupees a month. If I chase behind this, will I lose that as well? Would this â€˜pitching MACT casesâ€™ be okay for Jyothi? No! She won't be okay with it. But I don't care! Are you okay if I pay you 20000 rupees a month? I'll go, drink something and come. There are three decent hospitals in this area, including the general hospital. Among them, most of the accident cases come here. 'Mercury trauma care.' -Hold there. -Is this an accident? -Watch out. -Slowly, slowly. I'll also come. Okay, come. Let me go, eat something and come. Hey, shall we drink tea? Shouldn't we eat something? I'm hungry. Come. -Move aside. -Is this an accident? No idea, man. -I'll go in. -Watch there. -Come. -Don't shake. Walk straight. Hold there. Watch the steps. Watch the door. Doctor, is that guy in the pink shirt, his son? Move aside, please! Where did it happen? Near Batheri. Was it a bus? Yeah. If it is a private bus, there's nothing to worry. You will get the insurance claim. Since this is a head injury, you will get a tidy sum. Sign here, please. Excuse me. Please come with me. You may go now, brother. If he signs this vakalat, I could-- His father is still in the operation theatre. And there is still time to do all these. Don't worry. This is just a plenipotentiary procedure-- You jerk! Can't you understand? Brother... brother... Please go. Sorry. Didn't I tell you this won't work out? Simply getting beaten up by strangers! Let's find any other way. Mani pays me 1000 rupees. If you pay me 2000 rupees, I'll get you the next case. How unfair! 1000 rupees from Mani, and 2000 from us? Do as you choose. It's been a while since Mani started giving me money! This is a risky task. Why the hell should I trust you? Don't trust us! There are many other ambulances here! There are only two ambulances in this hospital. One is that Omni van, and then my Traveller. You may go and grab that loser Omni driver! But I'm the one who takes all major accidents here. 2000 is fine. But the case should be good. I didn't get it. Multiple fractures, head injury or something of that sort... O, my brother! I don't make these accidents. I'll give you what I get. Everyone should be happy. Note my number. Tell me. It's been 12 hours since I gave him my number. Thousands of people pass through the mountain pass everyday. Still, no accidents are taking place or what?! Ridiculous! How's your leg now? It's all numb. Why didn't you come to the hospital? I learned this only yesterday from Robin. From Robin! What else would he have told her? Yes! She's upset! He's told her about the accident cases as well. She will torture me now! Footsteps! She's here! Are you taking MACT cases nowadays? Here she goes! Blood money is what you earn from accident cases. Do you know how miserable an accident situation is? Exploiting them in such a condition... Unni, it's not right. I'll silently leave. Unni, my father's friend runs a law firm in Calicut IT Park. I have sent them your resume. They are ready to hire you. You'll get 30k as your starting salary. The lawyer who handled my mother's accident case made one and a half lakh rupees from that one case alone. Will you listen to me first? Hello. A road accident happened in Vythiri. I'm taking the patient to the hospital. Thanks to Suresh's on-time phone call, I managed to get away from Jyothi! Her nagging is unbearable! -Hey... -I should get rid of her. Hey! Go slow, man. If I ditch her, society will find me guilty. That cannot do. She should be the one to ditch me. I should push her to the limits! Argh! My... Bro, enough sightseeing! Lift the bike! The patient is shifted to room number 24. -Hey, what about my commission? -Darn! An oldie husband! Young wife! Shopping bag! Child! Financially broke too! Wait here. A water bottle and two bananas, please. He jumped off the footpath and got screwed up. It happened at Vythiri junction. The vehicle has got full coverage from Bharat Insurance. He skidded the vehicle on time-- Sister... What did the doctor say? Did the child eat anything? He must be starving. Have this, dear. Here. It's okay. You may have it. Water. Drink it. Sister, you didn't eat anything, did you? Here, have a banana. What are you up to? You thought you could outwit me with two bananas and a water bottle? If you pay 2 lakh rupees, I'll get my husband to sign the vakalat for you. Two lakhs?! Robi... Four years ago, when my father suffered a fracture in his hand, that advocate gave us one lakh rupees. In this case, he's fractured his femur bone in the left leg. That too, multiple fractures! Don't you know? Madam, isn't two lakhs a bit too much? Nowadays, insurance companies narrow down the claim amount a lot. Pay me two lakhs, and the case is yours. Or I'll hire another lawyer. I shouldn't have underestimated her with her distressed looks. She's smarter than I thought. Didn't she say that her father's arm got fractured in an accident? That may not be the case. She probably broke her father's bone! 45000 rupees! I'll give her it all and make her happy. What do you need, sir? The patient here... They got shifted to the VIP room. Have some water. Sister, why did you do this? What?! Didn't we say we'll make it ready? See, we are here with your advance amount. You said you'll make it ready, but did you? Adv Venu managed to do it. Leave advance, he paid the full amount. When we have such a good advocate, am I nuts to come looking for you? Satheeshan, are you there in court? We have one more case. Jansy will bring a copy of the vakalat. The rest of the papers will be ready tomorrow. Okay. What happened? Do you want a ride? Drop me at "Shri Matsya Avathara Mahavishnu" temple. Only God can help you now! What did you even think? That you can hijack it all in a wink? Aha! Nice girl! I should save her from this guy. It's my responsibility! Hey, chap! Four months! Fifteen years! Oh! A 15-year-old antique! Will be drop-dead with a heart attack! Isn't this our case number? Is your junior appearing for this? Why so? 'Our' case?! Who is this 'we?' First, you go to a temple and pray your heart out, not for us, but for your own sake. What if somebody hires you for their case! I'll get both the case and the claim. But not by going to the temple or praying... My God is enshrined in the building behind the temple. Annie Madam, the General Manager of Bharat Insurance. Madam is a bit busy now. Our regional head has come to the office today. Please wait. I didn't expect this at all. You surprised me. I know you don't celebrate your birthday. But birthdays are special, sir. We shouldn't miss it. Thanks for coming, sir. It was extremely helpful. Oh! Thank you, Annie. Nice. Diplomatic lady! Mukundan Unni? Advocate Mukundan Unni. Was it a busy day, Madam? Rajeevan, did you send those policy documents? No, Madam. Will send them tomorrow. What's the delay? Send it now. Diplomatic and arrogant! Okay, Madam. -Come. -Yes, Madam. Deadly combination! Madam, that auto taxi's settlement date has come. The settlement hearing is on the following Thursday. Okay. Swathi, you go with Rajeevan and do that. Madam, I'm on leave next Thursday. Why? It's my mother's 60th birthday. So, our family-- See Swathi. Don't be irresponsible. Birthdays come every year. You have to go. No excuse. Okay. That's nice. What? What you told Swathi. You made your point without raising your voice. What do you want to say? Madam, I am not saying this as a lawyer but as a representative of a majority of people. People who have a vehicle in our country pay for insurance every year. But many lawyers file bogus cases and steal that insurance money. Why are you telling me all this? There is a reason, Madam. Here, have a look at this. This is the register number of a case filed today morning. A road accident at Vythiri junction. There are footpaths on both sides of the road. But the accident took place when the party jumped off onto the road. So? Madam, isn't it contributory negligence? The party has got multiple fractures. Considering his age, he can claim a minimum of 15 lakh rupees. But, if your advocate is smart, quoting 'negligence of the claimant also, the cause of the accident,' you can cut down the amount to half. Do you have any issues with Adv Venu? Nothing like that, Madam. As I told you-- The client didn't hire you. Hence, Adv Venu also shouldn't get the case. That's it, right? If you get to appear in this case, will you pay the entire claim amount to the client? Madam, I guarantee you one thing. If I appear in this case, I will finish it in the most ethical and legally possible way. I'll close this case by charging only reasonable fees from the client as per the Advocate act. A few years back, Adv Venu also told me the same thing. You're not going to make any difference here. You are just another Adv Venu. You may leave. We need to go. How can we pay you a commission for the case we didn't get? All we got was an earful of swearing from that woman. -Can I give you a share of it? -What can I do about it? I asked you to pay me for informing you. -Didn't I inform you? -No can do. If we get the case, we'll pay you. If you are saying so-- Next time you should inform me before starting to the spot. Inform only me. I'm happy. The earth kept rotating. Bharat Insurance settled Adv Venu's claim for 15 lakhs without negotiation! There is some tie-up between Annie, the Insurance manager and Adv Venu! I think there is some tie-up between the Insurance manager and Adv Venu! This loser got it only now! Hey, the ambulance driver is calling us. Put the call on speaker. A crash has taken place on the side of the canal bridge. I'm starting the ambulance. Hurry up. Go fast. You were rushing for what? To buy acidity drugs for your mother? -Brother... -Can't you see the road?! Uh-oh! Brother, I missed, He came forward-- This is a one-way road, can't you see the board?! -It was so dark... -Manoj... -Who the hell gave you a licence? -Let go of him. These dimwits have no sense on the road! Open the door, man! This is jammed. -I tried to use the brake, but... -What but?! I pressed the brake! Brother, my phone is inside. Why do you need a phone? To call whom? Hey, come... -Can't open the door. -Let me call my boss. No need. Wait for the cops. Brother, please lay a hand. This door is stuck, I guess. I couldn't open it. Contusion and abrasion on the face. Deep abrasion over the right shoulder. If I get lucky, a multiple fracture too. 337A or 338! A claim worth two and a half lakh rupees. It's a good night. Hold him. -Lift up. -Get in. -Careful! -Move aside. Here, here. Place here. -Get the ambulance. -Robi, get my bag for me. Take the bike and come to the hospital. Okay. Get going. Slowly. Sooraj... They brought you here. What's the matter? Two lakhs down the drain. The bonnet is completely ruined. Didn't I warn you when you bought him a car on loan? Now don't borrow money to repair the car, Aunt. Let him earn money and repair it himself. Only then will he have some maturity. -Mom, let us take your leave. -Okay. Hey, are we going? Shouldn't we get the vakalat signed? What is this, man? No conscious person has ever hired me, even after wandering around for so long. Getting hired by an unconscious person is an absolute pleasure. It feels like I am in control. A copy of Aadhar card, Pan card, and a signed blank cheque as well. Here, sign this. Here, here. Shall I go? Alright. He left. Be seated. How do you feel? The pain has subsided. I may need a few days of rest at home. You have got an injection. The doctor said that he would be discharged after two days. Drink it. Will we lose this case as well? Never! All these struggles won't go down the drain. I need this case at any cost! See you tomorrow. What shall we do now? We'll file our vakalat. But if we file it, won't it become a duplicate vakalat? If a duplicate vakalat reaches the court, the name the petitioner chooses will be considered the original. The advocate who filed the duplicate will get in trouble. Since Sangameswaran sir is the judge, the lawyer's career will be at stake! -Will we screw up? -For sure! Unni, this doesn't seem right. Please don't do this. Yes! The moment I longed for is here! If you insist on doing this... Come on, tell me without hesitation. ...let's break up. How dramatic and predictable! I've had enough. It's time to move on. Erase all unwanted things without delay. That's the right thing to do! Nice. Now, moving on to the next chapter... Here's your balance. Can you pull out a patient's address and contact number from ERP? What will you give me in return? What do you want? Do you know the reason you are summoned today? I know. Thank you for saving my life. But I'll choose Adv Venu. Honesty! It comes with his age! Sooraj, don't you want to pay off your loan? OP 944/2021, Sooraj E.S. Sir, there's a duplicate vakalat as well. -Is this your case, Adv Venu? -Yes, sir. Can I call the petitioner? -Sooraj... -Sooraj... Venu, there's a problem. What happened, sir? An old client of yours has filed a complaint against you in the bar council claiming that you and your junior conned her. My client?! Yes, your client. One Mrs Prabha... Madathil. Prabha Madathil. Beware, this is court. Talk only when asked. Sir, she-- The complaint is that you have embezzled half of the claim money received in her husband's case. She has filed lawsuits against you both in the Bar Council and the court. So, the court cannot consider any of your cases until the Bar Council's hearing is completed. Advocate Mukundan Unni, what's your explanation? How did this duplicate vakalat come about? Your Honour, the original vakalat is mine. Sir, he's lying. Your Honour, my client's condition was too bad after the accident to sign the vakalat. That's why I took his thumb impression. He's right, sir. My advocate is Mukundan Unni. Human beings never disappoint me. Sir, he's lying too. See if the signature in this vakalat is yours. Sir... Is this your signature? This signature is mine. But I didn't put it. Not heated enough, I'll add some more fuel! Let it burn like wildfire! Sir, how can one with a fractured hand put a signature?! This signature is forged. What is this, Venu? How many years have you been appearing in court? Are you still this greedy? Give the court an explanation by 5 pm today for this duplicate vakalat. And the rest will be decided after that. Suraj, your counsel for petition would be advocate Mukundan Unni. My first ever case! Thank you, Your Honour. It feels like I've already won, even before winning. After getting warned by the judge, it will be tough for him to appear again before Sangameswaran sir. Yes! This is an opportunity! I should make hay while the sun shines. In other words, dry the grass when it's hot outside! Henceforth, Adv Mukundan Unni will take over Adv Venu's place! That's perfect! Aha! Fist-class! If this is how it is, feel free to ask me for any help. I'm ready. What's your name? Mukundan Unni. Unni Mukundan? Mukundan Unni! Be seated. Room number 6745. Maximum two weeks. Will get everything ready within that time. This is for the hospital expenses. This is for Dr Sebatti. ASI. For Meenakshi. For the first witness. Second witness. See, even that spot is the same! Driver, -and this is for you. -Eh?! For you. Watch out. Room number 115, 86, 20, and 90. Sir, this is a 2016, base model car. Only the driver will have the airbag. Except for that power window, central lock, and other features will be there. Let's finalise this. Take this. It's not just for you. It is for everyone. Not just the MACT case. Let me know if there's anything else, too. Sir, what about the name on the board? -The initials of our names-- -Mukundan Unni Associates. Hello. Are you busy? Are you doing it all by yourself? Can't you appoint a clerk? I mean, don't do all the work by yourself. But we should have a string of everything in our hands. Pitching the clients, appearing in court, how can you handle all of them alone? See, Wayanad has at least 700 accident cases in a year. Half of them will get settled on the spot itself. A quarter of the remaining half reaches Mercury Hospital. That is, Half of 700 is 350, and-- 87.5. Exactly! Around 88 cases. What if we get all of them? You must be wondering how? We'll acquire the hospital's security services tender... for about 30 lakh rupees. In our 50:50 partnership! Security guards have unrestricted access to all blocks of the hospital. A private agency provides them to the hospital. That agency has a tender every year. If we acquire it, all the guards in the hospital will become our employees. That means... All the guards in the security service will be our agents for the next year. Great idea! The oldie has started feeling insecure. Yes! I'm on the right track. Thirty lakhs is not such a massive amount. We can earn twice the amount in the next six months if we get all the cases. I'll keep quiet. Then, he may leave after sometime. Do you hear me? You may acquire the tender alone. Your mother... I took up her case, isn't that why you got to know about all these things? Right? Bloody prick! If you keep bugging me, I'll tear your cheek, cut off your tongue and feed it to the dog! Did you understand? Nasty old geezer! Where's the certificate? Okay. Here you go. And this too. You are pitching so many cases, right? Doctor, do you know what my dream is? You want to pitch twice the cases as Venu, right? No, I want to pitch every case that comes into this hospital. Too greedy of you! If you are with me, that is possible. Just don't give wound certificates to anyone other than my clients. Monopoly, huh?! Forget it. If that happens, you'll boss me around. That won't work out. What do you want? Want your testimonial about our hospital. Who wants? Vincent doctor wants it to upload to our website. The chairman's son's reformation parades! He's to fix everything at once! Darn! I have been thinking of asking you something for a few days now. Why do you do this job? Generally, those who complete LLB opt for other jobs, don't they? Like a job in a law firm or a bank. Or I can crack a PSC exam and get a government job, right? I write the PSC exam not because of my interest in it. I gotta have a safe and secure job to achieve a high demand in the wedding market. But I can't even imagine spoiling my entire life doing a government job. Then, what do you want to do in life? I... I want to sit idle at home, go for a trip once in a while, eat good food, and such things! To be frank, I don't like working at all. Now your turn, Why do you work in this field? Didn't you hear that ambulance siren? It's like an alarm clock for me. After each case, when I feel accomplished, that alarm clock reminds me that I haven't achieved anything. The work we do shouldn't let us take a rest. Going ahead! That should be our only goal! What if you can't go ahead? What if you fail? It's better to die and rot than to fail! Severe head injury, vomiting, possibility for a brain haemorrhage, What's this? Isn't the generator on? Must be a loose connection. I'll check and come. Take a CT scan and get them to the operation theatre. -You must explore the wound. -Okay, doctor. If my calculation is not wrong, this is a claim worth 25 lakhs! They've been shifted to the ICU. Those people are their relatives. Only relatives of the patients are allowed inside. Brother, we're their relatives. -Do you have an entry pass? -Pass?! An entry pass is required. Only then can I let you in. There is no point in waiting here. You cannot enter without a pass. When did they introduce this pass and piece? -What on earth is happening here? -Don't tell me all this. C'mon! Do relatives need a pass to enter? He says we need a pass to enter. This is an ICU ward. You can't make noise here. Maintain silence. Is the security contract renewed at such short notice? The new contract was supposed to start next month. But I called Venu and asked him to start it today itself. What happened? Are your plans not working out? How did it go? -See, he's right there. -Eh? Is he back to action? One with a brain haemorrhage and next with multiple fractures. Claims worth a total of 25 lakhs! I have seven guards in this block alone. That is, seven agents! Didn't I tell you that we will acquire the tender in partnership? But you are you! An arrogant brat! Are you interested in joining me? I pay 30k to my juniors now! Robi... Next month onwards, you will also get 30k! Hello, I can't reach Adv Venu over the phone. Can you please give him the phone? It's urgent. Bro... bro... There's a call for you. Some urgent case, it seems. Is it a fracture? I'm coming. â™ª My soul is falling â™ª â™ª Drowning, never crying though â™ª Wow! Like a poem... Marvellous than I thought! 'Condolences.' The accident must have affected him But, sir, that is not the main reason. Really sad! He was a good man! -Okay, doctor. -Okay. This case is not for us. He died not of a car accident but snake bite. Has the post-mortem report come? No. Can we turn this into an accident with a slight change in the report? -Is it necessary? -It is! Adv Venu's wife has financial needs. He spent a tidy sum to acquire that contract. You know it, sir. Even if Venu were in my place, he would have said the same. I'm sure of it. Where is his wife now? Insurance manager, Annie! Adv Venu's wife! A perfect match made in heaven! Not seeking Adv. Venu's whereabouts was a big mistake! I should never repeat such mistakes. Madam... What do you want? Are you here for vakalat? She's not gonna cooperate at all! But she is vulnerable for sure. An emotional approach would be better! Madam, I'm not the kind of a lawyer you think of me. Venu ettan, my brother, was no less than a mentor for me. After all, he was my senior. Wow! It's working! "Let's acquire the security services tender together," he told me. But I had no interest. 30 lakhs! That's a massive amount, isn't it, madam? So far, so good. I'm impressed with myself. Madam, if you are okay, I'll run that contract. Such a huge amount at this time... wouldn't it be a great help? I have no interest in this business. And I've no plans to give this to anyone. Especially to you! Arrogant loser! Everyone who snatches from the dead will eventually end up like this. Should I kill her too? How inhuman are you?! Should we really need go after this? We could go to KPL and get a case, instead. Robi, there is a concept in Management Science. "People with a monopoly in their market are more successful than those who invest in different markets." I need monopoly in my market. Sir... What's this? These are the wound certificates of the recent cases pitched by Adv Venu. There is a junior advocate. But she's not good enough. Don't you have any shame?! We don't need your bloody help. Unni! Give it back. Does Dr Sebatti have the authority to cancel the security services? Dr Sebatti is just an administrator. Such things are the director board's call. It's not easy to get them. And we've George sir's son there. I mean, the MLA Reshma George's son. You know him, Dr Vincent! This is getting complicated. I'll have to kill so many of them! Feeling things that aren't real. The first time it happened to me was in 1992, when I threw a firecracker and killed my grandfather, who was out for a walk. But I don't give a shit! Coz, at present, my only priority is the security contract. This guy is my only means to achieve it. Dr Vincent George, born with a silver spoon, yet, grounded, straightforward, empathetic, and extremely handsome. Maybe because he's born rich, he's not greedy for money. This is tricky! This is very tricky! I have no clue how to deal with such people. Still, I'll take a chance. What is this, man? I've been trying to delegate you a case and you can't even answer my call! Okay, okay, doctor. This accident occurred near Marappalam. The witness said that his autorickshaw lost control and hit a tree. File a Vakalat for him. A claim worth 2 or 3 lakhs. But when you get the claim amount, don't take it all. Don't miss out our shares. What was his name? Thoufiq. Bruise in right eyebrow and ear, right-hand fracture, multiple bruises, especially on the face. This is not an accident. You took this guy into custody and tortured him, didn't you? Sir misunderstood him with another guy. We thought his rickshaw smuggled weed and hence arrested him. His rickshaw's headlights were also not working. This happened totally out of misunderstanding. Everyone, including me, will get suspended if this comes to light. I didn't mean to break his bones. These new generation boys have got such tender bones. Not surprised, they only eat fast food. A slight twist and his bones broke! Please file a vakalat for him. Hit by a car or rickshaw, fabricate something of that sort. Leave Joseph and my shares. Just that, give that guy something. He's an innocent soul. -Hi Meenakshi... -Yes, doctor. -You think and decide. -Are you busy? - Yes! We'll wait for you in the canteen. Come. Did the result come? Yeah, the blood test result is here, but for not the urine test. No, I mean, are your PSC exams results out? Oh! You mean that? I didn't crack it. Keep trying. Only then can you crack it. Unni, don't take up this case. It's a case of custodial torture. We'll screw up if this comes to light. Robi, go to the canteen. I'll join you there. Okay. Actually, I'm also planning to write the PSC examination. Why do you need a government job when you own a hospital? This hospital belongs to my Daddy, not me! Baby, are you not going for lunch? Omelettes are almost over. Really?! Hey, girl! Come quick. Omelettes are almost over, it seems! -Doctor, did you eat? -Yeah, I did. Meenakshi, go ahead. It's already late. This doctor wanna take you home, I guess! Shouldn't I also be interested? You're interested in Meenakshi, aren't you, doctor? -Who told you? -Isn't it evident?! You've got a special smile when you stand next to Meenakshi. Nothing like that. She's well-mannered, well-brought-up... But Meenakshi likes me. Take it easy, doctor. Let's solve it in no time If you help me to cancel our hospital's security services contract I will ignore Meenakshi Deal? I know Meenakshi much more than you. She's highly self-motivated, straightforward and independent. Can such a person have feelings for you? It's impossible. No woman with common sense would ever consider a guy like you who milks money out of someone's misery. "Let's break up." So, reserve this blackmailing only for your innocent clients, not for me! Jyothi... Did she leave me because I was a nasty person? Never! After all, she didn't leave me. I left her. What a shame! OH, SHIT! SHE'S GETTING MARRIED! Radhakrishnan Iyer! IAS officer, well-off family. Showing middle finger! No! I can't let this happen! Everyone is getting ahead of me. What shall I do?! This time, let's sack a King cobra! And finish off one and all! Yes! Dr Vincent, Jyothi, and most importantly, Annie... will finish off one and all! No, don't go for it. If several people die together, the police may get suspicious. "What if you can't go ahead?" "What if you fail?" It's better to... ...die and rot than fail! Don't forget it, Mr Lawyer! Next, Adv Murali recalls Venu. Adv Venu was a prominent member of our association. As we all know, he was an honest and empathetic person who loved his clients. Madam... Didn't I already tell you? I will not give you the contract. I'm going to file a writ petition in the High Court tomorrow against the insurance branch manager, particularly the one who handles accident cases, holding the hospital security services. I know the contract is not legally in Venu's or your name. But if the Court probes the source of the amount used for acquiring the contract, it will put you in trouble. I'll implead Bharat insurance in this case. A wife settling her husband's cases is against the insurance company's clause, Madam! But I haven't settled any case filed by Venu. You can check if you want. I know that all the cases in Bharat Insurance are filed under Venu's junior's names! But the Court won't need long trials to understand the truth behind this. In case, if the court finds it suspicious, I will present all the old petitioners to the court. Mani will be the witness. If needed, you can argue that my evidence is fabricated. But the court will order to assess all the old cases settled by you. You'll be screwed. I invite Adv Venu's wife, Annie Kurian, to the stage. Please come. Come. It's been four years since you've been working at Bharat Insurance. You started as an assistant manager, then a branch manager. If you get promoted again, you'll be the division head. But if I file this writ, the company will fire you. Section 405, Criminal breach of trust. An offense punishable with imprisonment of up to seven years Annie, today you are all alone, with no husband to back you. Your kids, who're entirely dependent on you, their future, your career... It's your decision, Annie. Where were you, man? Custodial torture is risky. But still, I'll file it. Hereafter I will appear in all accident cases that comes under your circle. But choosing the advocate is the client's choice. How can I convince them to hire you? You must convince them! I will! Mani... Once the boy gets up, offer him money and get the vakalat signed. Also, get a wound certificate from Dr Sebatti. Where's his auto rickshaw? Won't "hit on a tree" be enough? Can't you give it a second thought? I'm the one who appears in Court for the case. So, it's my call. You go and push the rickshaw. The accident occurred near the half-built culvert... The rickshaw should fall towards the right side. ...between Kalpatta and Batheri when the autorickshaw - KL 12 H 6658, coming from the east to the west, collided with the bike - KL 12 F 1177, coming from the west to the east. This caused the rickshaw to skew into the culvert. No night reflector or board was on the spot to alert that the work was going on. The streetlamp was not working as well. When I 'properly explained the matter, Annie transferred the Security services contract to my name. And madam, I can't afford to visit this office frequently. Henceforth, I'll forward the claim details. Authorize them for me. This is double the amount Adv Venu used to pay you for the patients' vakalat. Sir, they have fixed additional cameras near the ICU. Most of the cameras are inside the ICU. And then, near the entrance and the emergency room only. Do you have CCTV access, Meenakshi? Who needs access when I can peep while they type the password? Cut off the CCTV, then. Don't turn off the live feed, might raise suspicion. Shall I appear for the brain haemorrhage case we took over from Adv Venu? For what sake? You appear in every case, don't you? Let me have a chance. Do you know the minimum quality required for a lawyer to appear in Court? If you want a case, learn to dress up like a lawyer first. If you want respect, you must look respectable. Your breath disgustingly stinks, Robi. Can't you at least brush your teeth properly? Hey, he is refusing to give it. What? Thoufiq's wound certificate. Really? Dr Sebatti? Dr Sebatti is on extended leave for his fistula operation. This is that other prick, Dr Vincent. He claims that this is not an accident. Shall we try in another hospital? How can that be done? The older reports are from this hospital. Don't talk rubbish, Robi. Such an idiot! Doctor, I need a wound certificate urgently. I'll send Mani to your house. You just sign it and-- Mister, My job is not taking orders from you. Your monopoly won't work out on me. I'm on rest after my surgery. I have no time for all of these... Bloody, punk! Where's that prick? Such third-rate lawyers goofing around in the hospital would affect our reputation. Finally, it would affect our doctors' careers. It may be a mere business for you, Daddy, but, not for me. And you know that well. Daddy, please... The doctor saw the guard getting the vakalat signed by the patient. How dare he enter the ICU and canvas the patients? Where's that lawyer? Hello sir, Mukundan Unni. Advocate Mukundan Unni. Remember me? You?! Yes, sir. How do you do? All well? Mister, I invested in this hospital only for my son. And running a hospital is a risky deal. Any issue there would adversely affect my political career. So, don't go for it. The practice of using the guard to get the vakalat signed, must be stopped immediately. Sir, you make sense. Hospital is a risky business. Why should you carry on in such a risky business? Can't you sell all your shares? Anyways, health industry is not your field. When does your security contract expire? Next year, by March 24. You may call it off next month. We are no longer outsourcing the security contract. No one allows a hard worker to flourish! Nepotism! I'll fight this. Where's Meenakshi? Aha! You're hiding here?! -Doctor was angry, right? -I was searching for you. Tell me, doctor. You may refer to this book, Meenakshi. -Let me have a look. -My cousin referred to this book. 101 questions for the PSC examination. Thank you. But this is 1001! Yup, 1001! Just refer to this. You'll crack the exam for sure! Meenakshi... Do you really want to crack the PSC test? No. Then why are you wasting your time learning these books? I don't mind if my wife is unemployed. You like to chillax at home, right? Shall we chill out together? The clients of the case filed yesterday will come and meet you. I've told them. Any update on Thoufiq's case? Hey, fix this, please. These pleats are not correct. That's the issue. Where's he? He went outside. Isn't Dr Vincent better than this fraudster? Leave the wealth and assets, You could have had a doctor when you fall ill. When we make a fixed deposit, don't we choose the bank based on the interest rate for the next 5 years? Isn't marriage an investment? You wait and see, Adv Mukundan's interest rate will be multiplied in the next 30 years. I'm sure of it. Suit yourself! Leave. It's Sunday. So, it won't be a problem. As it is a Sunday, no one will have to take leave for the wedding. Won't Unni be free that day? Didn't you propose to me only to beat Dr. Vincent? She's sly as a fox! She has a good future. My selection is great, just like my decisions. Killing two birds with one stone, huh? You said 'yes' to me after counting my interest rate, right? You are now playing on simple interest. To upgrade it to compound, you have to get more cases. How are you gonna arrange a wound certificate for Thoufiq? The two ingredients required for the wound certificate, No 1: Dr Sebatti's letter pad. No 2: Hospital seal. A letter pad is no big deal. I can design one in photoshop. But how can I get the hospital seal? I should make one! Eraser smells... exquisite! Why are you working your ass off for this petty issue? Just talk to our false witness agent, Mr Frederik. The seal will be ready within one hour! He's still as dope as he was before! Loser! Or leave it. If anyone gets to know, it will be trouble. It's better to make one yourself. After all, you can learn a craft. I should have killed someone smarter! This guy sucks even in hallucination! Polished shoes! Brand new jet-black pants! Pristine white shirt! Beard clean-shaven to the dot! My God! Hair gel, too! Mustache same as mine! Or better than mine! Shit! Here is Thoufiq's wound certificate. Didn't you say that we can't get it from another hospital? There are complete medical records from KPN hospital, including the wound certificate! That too, with multiple fractures. And about the hospital record, you can ask Meenakshi to delete Thoufiq's name from the ERP. He, who used to follow me, has now started thinking independently. This is dangerous! This is unacceptable! Unni, things are not how you think of it. You and Jyothi started practicing under Adv Gangadharan together, didn't you? Adv Jyothi is now appearing for MLA Reshma George in the High court. When I'm struggling here for a petty wound certificate, she appears in trials in the high court! That too for a high-profile case! Time flies, man. This is not fair! Screw you! Screw her! "The High Court hears the case against the Ex-MLA Reshma George this week." "This verdict is crucial for Reshma George's candidature" "in the assembly elections to be held next month." "The party hasn't announced the South Calicut candidate yet." "Is it because they are waiting for the verdict?" "I'm nobody to comment about elections." "As her advocate, what's your say on the case?" "I am certainly optimistic about the case." "Truth will prevail, that's for sure." Truth, my foot! Go to hell, loser! "Why is Adv Gangadharan not appearing for such an important case?" Coz he's sure that he's gonna lose it! "Sir has some health issues. Hence I appeared on his behalf." "Moreover, I was with him right from the start of this case." "Now I consider this case as the next step of my career." Everyone wants growth in their career, don't they? Everyone wants growth in their career, don't they? EVERYONE... WANTS... GROWTH IN THEIR CAREER. GROWTH IN CAREER! GROWTH IN CAREER! Growth! For Jyothi, growth has only one meaning! A space of her own, below Adv Gangadharan's office in Emerald towers. No, You can't beat me that easily! I was always better than you. Will be better than you! I am seeking a space. And ahead of you! It will cost around one and a half crore rupees. I have no idea how I will raise one and a half crores! But I will reach your goal before you. In one way or another! The owner is abroad. I'll get back to you after talking to him. Advance wishes for your wedding. Will Thoufiq's case be presented tomorrow? OPMV 121/2022 Thoufiq Ahammad, Advocate Mukundan Unni. Opposite party: Newland insurance, Advocate Jyothi Lakshmi. Is she appearing in this case as well? Greedy wretch! What health issue does Gangadharan have? Has he got Piles? Why are you wasting your time in a case you are gonna lose? So, only your clients win here?! I may have less chance of winning, but I'll try my best. The case has been posted for the hearing on the 18th of next month. EP 105/2021 Janardhanan, Adv Nelson Kuruvila. Opposite Party: Phoenix insurance Adv Jinumon Mani. Meenakshi. Poor girl! Your marriage is also fixed, right? Yeah. Is it an arranged marriage? Yes. What happened? Ours is a love marriage. Prepare the papers for the hearing and hand them over to Satheesan on Monday. I'm busy on Monday. I'm going to see a prospective bride for me. What's wrong? Only you are allowed to marry? The bride is a software engineer. Meenakshi is a mere receptionist. Whereas, his bride is a software engineer! This is painful! CRAP! Satheesan, please give me Thoufiq's case file. I forgot to take a xerox copy. Thoufiq Ahammad, this is the one, right? Won't you return it quickly? Now what?! What's she doing?! I know that look! Do you have any other file from Mercury trauma care? Wound certificate! Here you go. I have a copy with me. I'll give you. Here's the file. Are you not going for lunch? Adv Jyothi, come to the chamber. Jyothi has smelled something. The Judge also understood that. What's wrong?! What's wrong? What's wrong?! Where did I go wrong?! I can't go wrong! Keep the file back here once you are done. Let me have my lunch. Get lost, man! I'm starving. Are you guys not coming? Always arguing! Don't they have anything else to do? What did you do? Did you make this up? This imbecile is getting on my nerves! This is a forgery. If you get caught, your career is finished! I know that you lowlife! Sir is asking for that file. I'm screwed! The judge has found it out! Now, I've only one way to escape this! Sir, I'm withdrawing 121/2022. What's your explanation for this? What's it? What's wrong, sir? Are you putting on an act?! I am asking about the hospital seal. Sir, it's the wound certificate my party gave me. I don't know anything else. Where did one of the two snakes in this seal go? Went for lunch, huh?! Two snakes?! I don't get this! This is the new logo. and this is the old one. Two logos?! Hello, yes, I asked them to change the logo. Can I get any other discount? Vincent doctor wants it to upload to our new website. The chairman's son's reformation parades! Such a nasty world of snakes! He's reformed it so much that there's a head in place of the tail now! How can I track it if they make such changes in the logo?! This is going to cost me my career! Make sure the website is up to date when you download the logo. He has a point! I am sitting on this seat after seven years of practice! I can identify if the seal is original or forged at a glance. Sir, please. I'm getting married this Sunday. Congratulations. I'll get your future settled before that. Unni, I didn't expect that it would go to this extent. Me neither! I won't get involved in this anymore. Sheer negligence! I, who examine things on a microscopic level, made such a grave mistake! How?! Holy cow! How are you gonna defend this? Here, Judge himself is the witness! A complaint must have already been filed against you. What was the need for all these, Unni? Didn't I give you a proper wound certificate? He's crossing the line! -Hello? -Isn't this Adv Mukundan Unni? Yes. This is from DSP Sriram sir's office. He has summoned you to the office tomorrow. Who was that? Tell me, who was it? Come on, tell me! DSP Sriram. A righteous police officer who got a punishment transfer to Kalpatta. "Police arrested the lawyer for the Fraud insurance case." "Advocate Joshi Augustine was arrested by DSP Sriram's team from the court premises." "Bar association secretary Mr Pradeep Kumar stated that the arrest in the court premises was an act of sheer arrogance." "Adv Joshi, standing peacefully in front of the court, drinking Sharjah Shake, was arrested and taken away by a battalion of police officers." "People like DSP Sriram should be suspended from service." "Sriram sir, isn't your short-tempered nature the reason for your repeated transfers?" "This lawyer has filed fraud cases worth 65 lakh rupees in six months." "This arrest was made with the permission of High Court Judge and the Registrar." "The department will definitely take action against those who commit fraud like this." His father died in an accident when he was young. Hence he believes that what people earn from accidents is blood money! He is another emotional fool like Jyothi! 121/2022 Thoufiq Ahammad, Isn't this your case? Sacred mark on the forehead! Did he come straightaway from the temple? We've got a complaint against you for presenting a fake wound certificate in this case. Don't you have anything to say? Or, what's your plan? To go to the magistrate and sob, blaming it all on the petitioner? Open your mouth, you prick! Section 464 A, 464 D, 466, and 472. If we get Sangameswaran sir's statement, you'll be arrested. Aren't you getting married tomorrow? Happy married life. The law points he mentioned are correct. This is for real. He's planning to arrest me. Meenakshi expressed some sexual desire on our nuptial night But I can't even think about it now. She's disappointed. But I'll cater to her needs later. Now I have my needs. Will replacing the wound certificate now help? Sangameswaran sir has already seen it. Without the evidence, the case won't withstand, right? Judge is the witness in this case! I can't be of any help in this. Satheesan, please try it once. Mr Mukundan, aren't you an advocate? Should I explain this situation's seriousness to you? Here you go. Hey, Happy married life. You didn't invite me, did you? I felt so bad. -Mani, are you coming with me? -I will. I'll drop you. Okay, then. All doors close before me. Mani, were you invited to his wedding? There is no way I can escape defeat. Except one! Suicide! Hey, an inquiry has been ordered on our fake wound certificate case. This is the case in which the judge directly got involved. DSP Sriram sir is directly probing into it. He's a tough guy. Can't expect any consideration from him. Latest news, huh?! He could have waited for your arrest and then informed this! If they nab you, I also will be screwed. If that happens, I'll kill myself drinking the pesticide that I kept for spraying in the field. Why is he complicating it? Aren't sleeping pills enough for that? -Sleeping pills! -Yes. -Painless death! -Wow! A comfortable death! Do you remember? It's better to die and rot than to fail! I'll kill myself! But before that, let me put on my black robe one last time! Marvelous! Perfect attire for a honeymoon! Change your clothes. It's time for the bus. I've kept your white shirt in the bag. It was painful to watch you in that black robe today! She's insulting me to my face! I must kill myself. -Immediately! -Is it okay? -Okay. Where are you off to? Shouldn't we get water? Brother, 10 'Estazolam' tablets. Sleeping pills? Wasn't it my idea? Brother, get two dolo tablets as well. You won't need 10 pills to kill yourself. Seven pills are more than enough! Do you have the prescription? Or I cannot give you more than two pills. Two won't be enough. I should find some other way to kill myself. -Jinto... -Tell me, man. You have been doing the night shift for two weeks! Can't help. Need to pay my kid's fee next week. I'll buy it and come. Estazolam, give me two tablets. Then that... that below orange one! Hello? Hello, I talked to the building owner. If you sign the agreement next month, he will sell it for one crore. -Brother, I left it. -Why? Is the amount-- Why are you killing all these poor people? Can't you kill yourself alone? I'll do whatever I want! Do you call this water? Great! The lawyer who fights accident cases gets killed in an accident! It rhymes well! Poetic justice! We should have made this a five-days trip, as planned earlier. Two days will be over in a wink. Hey, are you even listening to me? Let's make it ten days. We'll go to Mysore and Kabani. Is it cool? No, five days would be enough. It is monsoon and there will be plenty of road accident cases. Don't take a break now. What's the point now, anyway? We're all dead, Meenakshi! Hey, there's some news! Sangameswaran sir got suspended! Wasn't there a case against Ex MLA Reshma George when Sangameswaran sir was the CJM? That order was framed! Some time ago, the registrar checked sir's laptop on the MLA's complaint and found two drafts of the same order. In one, the MLA was convicted! On the other, the direct opposite! Sir, we can create two copies of the judgment on the judge's laptop. One would state the MLA as guilty and the other innocent. Then, with your political influence, we will make the high court registrar inspect the laptop. If two different judgments for the same case are obtained from the judge's laptop, the order can be proven to be fake. Yeah, yeah, here you go. Did you see him? Did you? -Poor man! -Wow! Beautiful! Rain! Arrest! Sangameswaran sir! Exquisite! That means Sangameswaran sir's statement is of zero value now! I am free! I think that MLA has pulled strings behind this! Sangameswaran sir is an extra-decent man. Satheesan... replace Thoufiq's wound certificate with the one I gave you and file the case. With no delay. Okay. ANCHOR (On TV): Moving on to George Illikkal's response to the arrest of the MACT judge, Sangameswaran. The past few months have been quite stressful for us. We knew that we were innocent. Hence, we had complete faith in the judiciary of our country. He has once proved his unwavering faith in the judiciary by transferring the same judge earlier. Idiot! Sleeping pills! He drank it! It's better to die and rot than to fail! But, even when I was winning, I was destined to die! Nothing more to say. I died! Let me take your leave. Eh?! Where am I?! Is this heaven... or hell?! Unni, my child... Grandpa! I'm sorry, Grandpa. -I didn't mean to kill you. -Aha! My plan was only to burn your hand or foot. See, I also died. No, my son. You aren't dead. The lorry in front of you collided with another bus behind. Your bus is safe now. Really?! You won't die that quickly, will you? So, I'm not dead, right?! I'm back! Once again, the earth! Tourist bus! Accident! I am seeking a space. It will cost around one and a half crore rupees. He is ready to give it for one crore, if you sign the agreement next month. My magnificent resurrection! Hello? Hello? I couldn't reach you. The wound certificate I submitted in Thoufiq's case was from Dr Raghu at KPN Hospital. And Adv Robin gave it to me. Robin Thazhath. You replaced the old wound certificate with a new one, didn't you? The day Sangameswaran's statement is registered, you will be finished Is there any value in the statement of someone facing inquiry for faking the judgment? TATA Urban 9/12, 30-seater. Student bus. Thirty students if the bus was fully occupied. Then, the driver and the helper, That's irrelevant! The insurance company considers students as future assets. Claims worth a whopping amount! The owner needs the agreement next month, right? Yes. -Tell him it's ready. -Okay. Wow! A business worth two and a half crores, right? Meenakshi is right. If I get vakalat from all the 30 students I will get a minimum settlement of two and a half crores. I will buy the office in Emerald Tower with my share of one crore rupees. But, to bag all the cases, all the students should be taken to Mercury hospital. No ambulance should go to any other hospital. An ambulance for two students, as per that... -Hello? -I need 16 ambulances. Sixteen?! Sister, start nebulization for these two. There are no beds here. Open the other ward. Hurry up. Hurry up. Any death cases? No, but a couple of kids are in critical condition. Check here. Did you bring all the kids? Yeah, I brought all 31 of them. -Where are the ambulances? -Ours is in the parking spot. The remaining were Jio service ambulances. Suresh, there's a shortage of staff in the casualty. Sister, take her inside. Casualty is overflowing. Patients in critical conditions are prone to get shifted to other hospitals. Not a single patient shall be shifted to another hospital. I won't let it happen. I need all the 31 vakalats! Mark the total number of students here. Hello. Robin is calling me. I'll hang up the call. Gold! Something scribed in Arabic! I'll go with the gold. Because I'm a golden boy! Nice! There's no other man like me! Tell Jiju to reduce all the cylinders degrees by two points. Or they'll go overload. How long will the backup last? Sir, maximum 20-25 minutes. Hello? Sir, nobody is picking up the call at the station. Sir, it's utter chaos here. Sister, is Cherry responding? Doctor, his condition is critical, and we have no power backup. I've contacted the police station. They are sending the power unit. -Don't worry at all. -Okay, doctor. Ah! The power unit is here. Here's the list of kids who gave us the vakalat. -How many are there? -Twenty-two. Just 22? But there were 31 on the bus. Don't you know how they mix up things here? As the ambulance did not start, some children were taken by car to other hospitals. No need for three, use only one. Thus, we can extend the backup. At least we can serve those who are in critical condition. What about the vakalat of kids in critical condition? They must have been shifted. To where?! Those who are critical have been shifted to General Hospital and KPM Hospital Here is a list of all the kids who went on the tour. I collected it, calling the college staff. Smarty! I should encourage her! I love you. Love you too. I must call all the children on the list and convince their parents to sign the vakalat. I will! Hello, Irine? Here we usually file vakalat in accident cases. I called you to discuss it. Thanvi, yeah. Is this Thanvi's father? Sir, this is a call from Mercury hospital. Shabari Kumar? Sundarambal, are you Tamil? Vinay, my dear... Please give the phone to your father. Sir, in case if any police investigation or interrogation comes up... Hello? Hello? Six lakhs if there are multiple fractures. Sir, this is an insurance claim, not any fish market. Uncle, you don't need to pay any fee. Instead, if the claim gets passed, you'll get the cash. Five lakhs. Six lakhs. It's confirmed. Five lakhs. Aren't there 31 of them in total? But here, there are only 30. Sorry, that's my mistake. A student's name was missing in the list I gave you. Cherry Joseph. He joined the trip at the last moment. -Meenakshi is being very careless. -That's why his name got missed out. I encouraged her vainly. Now, how'll I manage to get that vakalat? Is a student named Cherry Joseph admitted here? My dear lawyer, Keep it confidential. That child passed away just a while ago. Know what'll happen if the news leaks that the boy died due to the hospital's fault, right? Anyways, George sir is going there. He'll deal with it. Advocate... You... Need to spread the news all over the world. Everyone should get to know. That's the right thing to do. Hello. Is this the office of Chakrabhumi news? Days to celebrate are here! It's party time! Don't over-think and pin the blame on the hospital now. Daddy, if at all we had an additional generator, we could have saved that child. What more, we don't even have adequate oxygen cylinders here. You don't need to mention this to anyone.... That boy's body has been taken to the general hospital, for postmortem. Shall we go and get the Vakalat? Go to my home and bring my car for me. Okay, done. Media van! I informed them at 4 in the morning and they are coming only now?! Security, don't allow them inside. These bastards are here! You don't need to come, Daddy. I'll talk to them. This is not your problem alone, now. Next month we have the election! I warned them that the hospital would screw us up! I also warned you the same! You didn't pay any heed. Sir... Jose sir... -Now, pay the price! Face the storm! Unfortunately, a student passed away in a college bus accident. We are very sorry for the loss. Oh no! What's he up to? Arun, the generator is a machine. It may get out of order sometimes. When we talk about machines, there are three kinds of-- Sir, was there a shortage of oxygen? Who told you all this? The other case is okay, right? Did the power go off due to that tree falling, sir? Yes. A fine, strong tree. There are cut marks which suggest that someone cut the tree. After all, this is a political ploy. Once George sir gets free, I can inform him. Is it necessary? This is election time. What if he uses that report against the opposition? And if the opposite party wins the election, they will open the case of Thoufiq to avenge you for the report. We both will be screwed. And then you will have to drink the pesticide-- No, no! I won't give the report. After all, who asked for the report here? Don't give. That's good for us. An accident occurred. The hospital did what we could. There's a correction in the report. Don't mention the mark on the tree. Sir, a child died, and you claim you did what you could?! How can the public vote for you after such irresponsible remarks? Bineesh, why are you linking this with the election? A child died because of the inefficiency of the hospital where you are a board member. As far as you are here, no inquiries would take place against the hospital. I have never done anything unsuitable for our land. I won't do it in future, too. And I am deeply saddened by what happened in this hospital. You can't justify-- We're giving up all our allies with this hospital. We won't interrupt the police investigation. Election candidates will be announced next week. We seek all your support. Unlike that beardo, this lady is intelligent. Rajeev, get the car. She knows that the health industry is not her domain. She's a true politician. I should bring up Meenakshi to this lady's standard! Shall we go to the general hospital? Huh? She's here as well! Is the postmortem over? No. Did they sign the vakalat? No. -My child! -Oh-no! My son! O, my child! Is it appropriate to ask them now? Didn't I tell you do not go! Son... Did they sign the postmortem report? No. Need to get their signature in all these papers. My son, please open your eyes. My dear... Here. You may go now. I'll get the vakalat for you. He's hopping mad. Understandable. I will calm him down. How did the bride-seeing ceremony go? Did I tell you to make Thoufiq's case an accident? Did the DSP call you? Why did you testify against me in Thoufiq's case? Did the DSP say so? Robi, aren't you an advocate? Listening to petty cops and... Yes, I am an advocate! That's why... I knew that you would say it. I want half of the money you earn from the tour bus accident case. It will be around two and a half crore rupees. What if I won't give you? I'll reveal it to DSP. What? That how you managed to arrange 30 wound certificates. Half the amount is a bit too much, Robi. But I can give you a share. How much? One-third. One-third... Okay. I need my share in cash. I'll get it ready. How did the bride seeing go? My engagement is on the next month. So fast! There are two types of people in this world, those who exploit and those who get exploited. Don't try to be the former! You cannot handle it! As I said earlier, all unwanted things must be erased immediately. That is only fair! I deserve a good life with lots of happiness. Lots! You didn't invite me to the office inauguration, did you? Do come if you are free. The claim order is sanctioned. Discuss the procedure in detail with the students. There shouldn't be any confusion. Okay. How many crores of rupees is this case worth? Two crores and fifty-eight lakhs. The insurance manager is a gem of a woman. She sanctioned the claim orders in no time. The judge who filed a case against you is under suspension now. The fake wound certificate caught red-handedly by the judge has been replaced with original. The one guy who links all these things, Robin, he's brain-dead. You created Robin's accident, right? After all, it's monsoon, sir. Had to apply brakes when a stray dog jumped onto the road. I lost control, and the car skidded. If you weren't an advocate, you would've died in lock-up by this time, bloody jerk! DSP Sriram got transferred again. To Manipur, this time! He'll struggle as he doesn't know their language. The brain-dead Robin is now fully dead! Sangameswaran, who stood against me, got fed up and resigned. Hello? Adv Jyothi Lakshmi lost the case, and her wedding broke off. No, someone broke it! No, I work here now. Where's Mukundan sir? We moved from Wayanad. Are you happy?! I started the office of Mukundan Unni Associates in Kozhikode Emerald Towers. I invited Jyothi as well. Classic Jyothi! She showed up! Shameless! Where's the restroom? Need to change the scooter tire. Can't you buy a car? Everyone cannot be like Unni. MLA Reshma George convinced her husband to transfer the Mercury hospital shares on my name. A leader is the one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way. She is a true leader. I think I love her! Madam... Don't nurture people like him. Why nurture? He will flourish by himself. What is wrong with being like Unni? Have you noticed the most successful people? Like politicians, businessmen, world leaders. Do you think they are successful only because of hard work, dedication, perseverance and all? They're mere melodramatic theories made only for the motivational books. Every sin pays off, the sinners get punished eventually. I believe in Karma. It's good to have such beliefs. You can console yourself when you're entirely busted, just like now! My name is Mukundan Unni. Adv Mukundan Unni. I'm 30 now. I have a hospital of my own in Wayanad. Doctor, do you know what my dream is? I want to pitch every case that comes into this hospital. Monopoly, huh?! Forget it. If that happens, you'll boss me around. -That won't work out. -Doctor...
