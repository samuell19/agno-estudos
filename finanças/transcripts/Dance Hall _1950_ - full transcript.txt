It's just one of those things. He'd just finished his speciality when he caught my eye. He's Ted Heath's new trombonist. Has he got hot rhythm! You'd like him, Maureen, he's ever so refined! Peter says we've got a chance at the finals, if we practice hard. Eve's got a chance too, if she gets the right partner. Wouldn't it be wonderful if Peter and I won? - Have a nice time, dear. - I will. - Don't be late back. - I won't. Hey! -♪ Knees up, Mother Brown ♪ ♪ Don't get the breeze up Knees up, Mother Brown ♪ You've done it! -♪ Knees up, Mother Brown ♪ -♪ Knees up, Mother Brown ♪ - Do you know what... Hey! I'll wash up when I come back, mother. - Cooey! - Hello! Come on, hurry up, we're late! - Where's Georgie? - I don't know! I think I've laddered my stocking. - There you are! - I just put them on! Oh, never mind. I had to queue up for these! Come on, Carol! - Come on, we're missing it! - Let's watch for a bit. - Oh, come on! - All right. Hello, Susan. Georgie! You don't mind if I don't see you home tonight? You never do see me home. I know, but tonight's rather special. I've got a date with a smasher. Bit old, but she's still a smasher. - How old? - Er, 21. Come on sister, let's have a loan of that frame for this struggle. Is that how you always ask a girl to dance? No ma'am, I picked it up last night in Streatham. - Phil, you're not concentrating. - I am! - I'm trying to find what's wrong with you. - What is? Your hair. You've done something different. It's been like this for days. Well, I've been away for days, I've been in Norwich. I like it. - Where are you going this week? - Northold, Gatwick, Croydon and East. I rather go for that little curl arrangement on the top. - Oh! - Oh, Phil, look where you're going. - Hiya, Jimmy! - Hello there. - How's the romance going? - Okey-doke. Fine. Pretty girl! - Who is she? - No idea. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Our first dance this evening is an "excuse me" dance. Hello, Alec. Hello, Jean. Coming? But, Phil, it's only nine o'clock. I want to talk to you, Eve. I haven't seen you for over a week. What's up? You two going? - Yes. - Oh! Hey, wait a minute! But Eve, I want to go now. Are you coming with me? Well, I want to dance! Okay. Don't look at me, I ain't done nothing. - Thanks for the lift! - Hope you sleep well. - I'm off to see my girlfriend! - I'm going home to my wife! So long! Hello Mary! Is Eve in? - I don't think so. - Where's she gone? - Palais, I think. - Okay, be seeing you! Slow, quick, quick, slow. Quick, quick, slow. Quick... hold it a minute! You needn't run away with the idea that you're hot, because you're not! Some of you are in the Championships. You... And you. Not you. But you have to improve those pivoting actions. Come on let's get back to work. - Eve! - Now, then! Let's see you do it properly! Come on! Keep those arms up! Pst! Now, then. After two. One, two, and slow! - Eve! - Quick, quick, slow. Quick, quick, slow. - Quick, quick, slow. - It's important! Wait! I came over specially! Hold it a minute! If Miss Bennet and Mr. Vyners will kindly leave the floor, the rest of us might resume according to plan. Come on let's start again. Sorry! - My fault, sorry. - Now, after two... - Nice going, Pal. - Sorry about that, Eve. - I thought you'd be at home. - I was, Phil but... Alec and I are going for the Championships. - The what? - The Championships. - Is that so? - Any objection? - Well, I might have. - We've got a chance of winning, really! Been practising regular since I've been away? Well, we have been working rather hard, haven't we, Alec? We've been at it both early and late. Everybody on the floor for general practice! You do understand, don't you, Phil? It's the Championships! Is it? You don't suppose I'd spend my Sunday mornings here if it wasn't, do you? Phil! - What's up? - Nothing, Phil's being stupid, that's all. That's the Gull IV. With the wind in this direction, she's unlikely to get hill lift. She'll probably try for the Thermals over the Puggories. Do you bring Eve here every Sunday? - Yes, most Sundays. - Does she know what you're talking about? No! - She gets bored stiff. - Is that why you brought me here today? - No! - Come on, don't give me that stuff! - Have you two quarrelled? - No! Come on. Oh, I'm fed up. Every time we go out, she has to go to the Palais! Well, okay. That's her cup of tea, this is mine. Eve knows I'm no Astaire, yet she goes off dancing with some other type. She likes dancing, you like planes. Well, at least planes don't try to date you up. If I had sense, I'd find another girl. It's all perfectly harmless, Phil. If Eve wants a good time, she wants you to give it to her. She knows dancing isn't everything. Yes, Mary, I know that. Eve's a honey. I don't care what she does in the Palais. She can dance her head off if she wants. But I dislike Alec Vyners. If she goes on dancing with him, I'm through. But Phil, it's only for the Championships. - Where's this? - Home. I've got a Benny Goodman record I'll play it for you. No. What is it? Still sore at the boyfriend? No. Let him worry my sweet, it'll do him good. - Come on, ten minutes. - No. - Five. - No. - It's not 11 o'clock yet. - I'm a working girl, mister. Okay. When do I see you again? Tomorrow? I don't know. We got to practice some before the heats. Well, Thursday, maybe. Okay, then, at the Palais. - Thanks, Alec. - You're welcome. Late, aren't you? It's only eleven. If you'd been earlier you'd have seen Phil. Phil? What did he want? How should I know? I said you were out with your new chap. - Mother! - You were, weren't you? Yes, but... - Phil won't make it up! - What? - Phil! - Yes? Won't make it up! Oh. If you ask me, the Championship's all hooey! All what? Hooey! - Cooey? - What? - Cooey! - Who? Oh! Ladies! Ladies! Come out of that jungle! I feel sick. - Why? - I'm scared. Hi, partner. - Is Alec here? - Yes. Come on. Well, ladies and gentlemen. - This is another big occasion. - What, again? We just can't stop. Tonight is the first heats of the Greater London Dance Championships. Well, you'll know him next time. The first heat consists solely of a waltz, and the judge is that internationally famous figure, Mr. Herbert Grey. What's up with you? - Anyone would think she was your wife. - She is. Oh! Ladies and gentlemen. The following numbers pass onto the next round: number one... Number five... Number six... And number eleven. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I have the best possible news for you. The management of your favourite Palais is determined to give you three times your money's worth... And bring you the most popular and glamorous of all dance teams. They've arrived here fresh from their triumph in Madrid. Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you Chiquita and Juan! - Okay, ducks? - Okay. It's nice, isn't it? We never know with these places, do we? I mean, you've been lucky. Look at this, I've been meaning to get a perm for days, all this dancing... That was pretty good. We must go back. See Alfie gets to bed, I'm going out. I can't mother, Alec's fetching me. - What time? - Seven. Well you've had it, my girl, it's past eight now. You were a fool to chuck Phil Hart. This other chap's afraid of getting caught, if you ask me. Tell Alec I've gone to the Palais. It's no good, Mike. After the way Fred treated me, I'm finished with men. Hello, Eve! I thought you weren't coming. I've been waiting for Alec. - He's here. - Here? Yes, in the bar. Thanks. Dear, I hope I haven't said anything I shouldn't. You know, you look just like a bulldog I once had. He died. Hello, Alec. Hello. Er, this is Doreen. Hello. - Are we going to dance? - We are. - Who is she? - Oh, just a girl I know. Oh go on Carole, you don't mean it! Yes I do, I'm finished with men! - What about Mike? - Mike's not a man, he's a mountain! "Mike", I says last night, "Mike, you're just..." Hello, Mike. Hello, folks! Hello Phil! Fancy seeing you! Come on Georgie, we'll miss out bus! - No, Eve, can't we... - Phil! Come on. It's no good trying to stop me by saying it's none of my business. Because it's the business of any friend of yours. And I'm still a friend, aren't I? Phil! Aren't I? Of course. Alec's used to going around a lot. He know heaps of people. What I can't take is that he's making you so unhappy. I'm not unhappy. Okay. It doesn't work. It's nothing against Alec, it's the way he's made, I suppose. It was all right at first. But now, he does things like... last night. To show he's not going steady with anyone. He keeps on saying "don't fence me in." I don't mean to fence him in. But somehow... He was keen on me, Phil, really, he was. Yeah. I'm sure he was. Well, that's finished, anyway. - Do you mean that? - Yes. What about those Championships and things? He can find someone else for that. That won't be hard. I've been pretty sick without you. Phil! Phil, I... I think you ought to know, you see... - Alec and I... - That's over, see. - Phil! - No. I don't want to know about it. Your turn next, Mary. I love you, Eve. This thing's driving me mad! Mad! Shop-soiled, that's what I am! Cheer up, it's the Palais tonight. I'm not interested, I think I'm going to a monastery. You mean a nunnery. Eve! She looks married! That's what it does, right? - Where've you been? - Home! - Home! No more factory! - Tell us about the flat! How's Phil? Fine, he has to go away rather a lot at the moment. - Why don't you come see us? - You haven't been at the Palais! - Come tonight! - The semi-finals! - The semi-finals? Are you in them? - Well, only just. Listen to her! They're going to win. Can't you come? I'd love to. - Why not? - Bring Phil! He's tired when he gets home. We don't go out much. Hey! Who's boss in your house? Just because you're married doesn't mean he's going to chain you up in a tower or something, does it? Well, I'll see. Oh! Hello? Yes, me. Oh! I'm sorry darling, I couldn't ring you before, I was over the other end of the field. Yes, I know it's lonely for you. Can you amuse yourself for an hour or two? Yes, but I specially wanted you now, I want to go out. Yes, but I don't want you at nine-thirty, I want you now. Hurry! Hurry up, Georgie, you don't want to be late. - Alright, mum! - Hello Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. - Is Georgie ready? - Nearly! Come on, Carole! - I'll open the door for you. - Oh, that's all right. - Hey, Georgie, buck up! - I shan't be long. There's a bit about the semi-finals in the paper. It'd be great if Georgie got in the final! We mustn't expect too much, dear. Georgie Wilson, Greater London's new ballroom queen! Just like that! Is that what they wear? Only the big shots. She'll need something snappy if she gets into the final. Georgie, have you got a flat tyre or something? I'm ready! Bye mum! Bye dad! - Won't be late. Come on, Carole. - Who, me? Well, she may not get into the finals. She will. - Hello, Eve! - Hi! Where were you? I haven't seen you for months! - Married. - Hm. Seen any of the others? Yes, they're around somewhere. Bye! Hello, Jimmy. - Why, Doris! - Eve. Yes, of course, silly of me. - How's er... - Phil? - He's fine. - It was nice to see you again. Eve. Look who's here! - Hello Mike, hello Carole. - Hello, Eve. We didn't think you'd come. - Hello Georgie. - Hello Eve. - Where's Phil? - He couldn't come. Have we got time? I haven't danced for ages. Come on, then. Ladies and gentlemen... Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd kindly clear the floor, we can introduce you to our judges. I'm back, darling. Eve? Ladies and gentlemen, these members have passed to the finals. The judges had a very difficult task, because everybody was very good. Still, here they are. Number one... Number three... And number six. Oh, Peter! Georgie, how wonderful! Peter, jolly good! Oh, now for the finals and you're all set! Georgie, I must dash. Bye, all! Bye! Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have the pleasure to present our next attraction. Hy Hazell.

Fine. You should try it, sometime. Maybe I will. How about a drink? - Just for old time's sake. - No thanks, Phil will be home. I've got a special dinner for him. He thinks I'm a smashing cook. He's a lucky guy. You don't come here anymore. I only came tonight to see Georgie. Phil never cared much about dancing. He says it's silly to keep going out when you've got a nice home. - Come on, let's get that drink. - No, I must go, really, Alec. Okay. It's been nice seeing you. It's been nice seeing you, Alec. Shame about the Championships. - We would've won it, you know? - Go on. We would. Goodbye. - So long. - Goodbye. Arsenal: four. Newcastle United: one. Birmingham: two. Middlesborough: nil. Bolton Wanderers: nil. - Phil, I'm ever so sorry, didn't realise... - Ssh! Burnley: two. Charlton Athletic: nil. When did you get back? - Chelsea: nil. - Ten past nine.

Yes, you said you wouldn't be back till late. And I met Georgie and Carole on the bus today. - They told me... - I thought you would give up the Palais. It was the semi-finals of the Championship! - Aston villa: two. - Did Alec win? Sunderland: four. Alec wasn't in it. - Wasn't he? - No. You danced with him. - Phil! - Well didn't you? - What on earth's the matter... - Look Eve, I'm trying to listen to this! Blackburn Rovers: two. Coventry City: one. - Hull City: three. What's up? Green pea soup, sufficient for four persons. Baked beans and pork, sufficient for four persons. Stewed steak! Sufficient for four persons! - You've eaten enough for 12 people! - Well, I was hungry. And the steak's on points, too! You could make a meal yourself if you stay away from the Palais! - Why shouldn't I go to the palais? - Because I don't like it! - Why? - Because I just don't like it! Why are you trying to make me feel ashamed? I haven't done anything! I only went to the Palais because of Georgie! They asked you too, that's why I wanted you home early! Sheffield Wednesday: three. Swansea Town: two. Chesterfield: nil. Eve? Go away! Eve, I am sorry. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry about the steak, too. You're a pig, I hate you! - Eve, let me in. - No. Eve! Open the door! No! Eve! Go away! - Phil? - Now, you go back to bed. You shouldn't. Don't you expect this every morning. This is just a peace offering because I behaved like such a ghoul. Phil, I love you. Come in. Hello Georgie. Hello Mary. Relax, Georgie. I'm not going to eat you. Not that I wouldn't like to, mind you. Oh, Jim, stop teasing her! Er... Georgie... There's something for you on this chair. Oh! With the compliments of the Palais dance committee. - For one night only. - For me? Just a little thing I ran up myself. Wouldn't you like to try it on? Oh, yes, please! Hey, wait a minute! You'll get me in the Sunday papers! Mary! It's just like stepping into a cloud. Anybody in? - Oh, hello. - Well, do you like it? Where did it come from? Dad and me bought it for you this morning. Your mother chose it. I thought it a bit fancy, myself. But I daresay she's right. - Oh, mummy! - Oh! Aren't you going to try it on? - Yes, I'm dying to. - Go on, Joe, you're in the way. Now, I'm going to get tea. Call us when you're ready. - Hello, Betty. - Hello Eve, how are you? Fine. Oh! What have you got in there, dynamite? Sixteen pounds of potatoes. - You're looking well. - I'm feeling well. Can I give you a lift? I haven't finished my shopping yet, I promised to get Phil some fish. I'm just going to the fishermen's. - I've just been, they're closed. - Oh dear! Kippers any good to you? Pal of mine had a case sent, let me have half. I don't know what to do with them. - Phil loves kippers. - What are you waiting for? Come on. ♪ Wake up my dreamer ♪ ♪ To a dream come true ♪ Here they are. Remember this? Yes. Uh-uh. Uh-uh? - How funny! - What? I thought I'd always feel something for you. But I don't. It might never have happened. - What are you getting at? - You know what. You were going to make a pass at me because you can't help making passes. And it didn't mean a thing! Oh Alec, I'm so glad it's Phil and not you! Lady, how you flatter me! Oh, you're a sport. So are you. That goes double. I must have been a fool to let you go. It's the best thing you ever did. For both of us. Well, after all that, I'd better be going. Bye. It's funny. Lovely grub. - The best kippers I've tasted. - They were good, weren't they? They're Scotch, from Aberdeen. - Better hurry. - You don't mind, do you? - Georgie's so keen on us being there. - Ah! Only Georgie? Hiya, slaves! Quiet, fellas! - Sure you've got everything? - Everything. Goodbye mum. Bye, dad. Thanks ever so much! We'll be thinking of you, wishing you all the luck you deserve. I'll need lots more than that. Bye! - Good luck. - I wish we were going to be there. You know very well we'd only make her nervous and mess the whole thing up. Georgie! Come on, you'll be late! All right, there's plenty of time! There won't be by the time you've got your dress on. Mary, I'm not going to change my frock. I'm going with this one. Don't be silly. Ah, there you are at last! - Is there anything I can do to help? - No thank you, we can manage. Well, good luck, Georgie. Now, what's all this? - I told you, Mary, I can't. - Yes, I know! - You should have told them what happened. - How could I? Anyway, it's really awfully nice. What's Peter going to say? All the other girls have proper dresses, he'll think you don't want to win. I feel terrible about it. Listen, Georgie, they want you to win, don't they? - Of course. - Well, then. Between ourselves, I always keep mine on with chewing gum. Ah. Good old Moss Bros. - Look, there's the Cricklewood pair. - Ignore them. You don't want the judges to think you're afraid of anyone. - I'm afraid of them all. - Nonsense! - Hello, Peter. - Hello. - Oh, I say, he looks handsome. - That's right. It's the only way for a man to dress. Well, goodbye Peter, and good luck. I hope the best pair win. So long that it's you. I hope Georgie won't be late. Here she is! She looks smashing! Doesn't she look wonderful? Georgie, you look a treat! You're bound to win in that. Will you clear the floor for the Championships? Gosh, this is it. Everyone off the floor, please. - Where's my number? - Here you are. If you please, now. We can't have you winning by mistake. As you all know, this is the final of the Greater London Amateur Ballroom Championship. There are six judges tonight, all experts who have made British ballroom dancing known throughout the world, as a pattern of what ballroom dancing ought to be. I'm sorry. Excuse me. She isn't there. Come on, Georgie! Atta boy Peter! Show 'em how! Come on, nine! It's in the bag! Come on, nine! It's in the bag. Cricklewood! Cricklewood, come on! Georgie! Peter! Come on, Regans! Come on, number eight! Cricklewood! Come on, Wimbledon! Come on kid, you can do it! Come on! Come on, man! Come on, Hammersmith! Come on, Hammersmith! Georgie! Very good! And you, Peter! Well, now! Here are the results. The judges have awarded first place to number... eight! Second to number four. And third... to number eleven. Sorry, Peter. Don't be silly. It was my fault. We mustn't ever let her know we came. Mummy! Never you mind, Georgie, you were the best of the lot. But my frock! It looked lovely, dear. Oh, I feel dreadful! Don't be silly, Georgie! Sorry. - Did they see? - Nobody saw anything. Here's Peter. - I wondered... - Hello, Peter. - Hello, how are you? - If there was anything I... No, it's alright, thank you, Peter. I'll see Georgie home, if you like. I mean, I'd like to. That's very kind, but it's no trouble. Oh, I don't mind. I mean, it's no trouble to me either. Perhaps we'd better be getting along. - Unless... - Oh no, mummy, don't wait for me. - It's all right. - See you later. Coming? Oh! - How am I doing? - You're crippling me! It's bad luck, Eve, but if we go on living together, we need to give up the Palais. It's not the Palais, it's those steam hammers you call feet. Well, let's compromise and have a drink. Funny it's all over, isn't it? I can't believe it. We'll try again next year. Yes. Cold? Oh, it's no good, Peter. We're only kidding ourselves. We're not in the Regans' class and we never will be. - I don't know. - Yes, you do. Funny, I had a feeling this was going to be a wonderful evening, and it's been awful. - We weren't so bad. - Oh, it isn't the Championship. It's mum and dad. Don't cry, Georgie. Georgie, don't! I'm sorry. I don't often. Don't look at my face, it must be all blotchy. I don't care if it is. Georgie... - Peter! - What? I'll make your face all wet. Well! Oh, hello! So it takes a Championship to bring you back! What'll you have, Oh, a pint, please, miss. Good heavens, no, I don't want any! Why don't you ask Mr. Fairfax? - What's this? - He's got a crate of kippers or something. - Doesn't know what to do with them. - Well, he knows my address! Cheers! Cheers. It's all a try on, really. Trying to get me up to his flat! I don't believe there are kippers. You kidding? The place looks like an aquarium, doesn't it, Eve? Does it, Eve? Phil, I forgot to tell you. The kipper we had for supper, they were from Alec. I happened to be on High Street, I met Alec, he told me he had kippers, and I... They were awfully good, weren't they? The way my flat looks you'd think it's a cat convention. Oh, Mr. Fairfax, I've lost my bag! Can you tell me what to do about it? Yes, yes. Mm, I think he's cute! Don't forget to send him his kippers. - Or are they only for your girl friends? - Only for my girl friends, baby. I just say "come up and see my kippers" and they come a-running. Phil, stop it! If you want to start a rough house, better find another pitch! Just a silly fellow. Now, sir, if you wouldn't mind joining your friend outside. What have I done? Let's save an argument, shall we? You must have thought so too, running to him the minute my back was turned! - It's a filthy lie! - Is it? - Well, you ought to know about lies! - Oh! - That was a stupid thing to do! - Let me go! Don't you dare! You've certainly made an exhibition of yourself! Yes, the minute I married you! - You're horrible! Horrible! - Thanks! You're jealous of everything and everybody! You won't let me do anything or go anywhere. You just want me to stay home and be bored! What about me? I've been pretty bored too, seeing you mooning around, thinking about Alec! Well, anyway, I was never bored with him! - I expect you wish you'd married him! - Yes, I do! Yes. But he didn't need to marry you, did he? Oh! Happy new year! Happy new year, Molly! When do we leave for the Palais? I'll pick you up. I'm meeting Peter first. He's got the ring. - Has he? - Everybody's getting married but me! I was wondering when you'd be back. I slept at mother's. I don't care where you slept. Can you stay there next week? Yes. After that you can come back here if you want to, I shan't be here. There's a job going down at Cardiff. I'm going up on Monday to see if they'll have me. I'll send the rent every week and a little extra. I don't want your money. Well, I'll send it to you anyway. I'm legally responsible for you till after the divorce. Divorce? Phil! I telephoned a lawyer today. I'll see him before I leave. Here's a list of some things I'd like to hang on to. You should look through it. If there's anything you want to have, let me know. The cutlery and all that, you can keep. The furniture's paid until the end of next month. - Phil, couldn't we wait a bit... - What for? What's the use of piling on the agony? There's no sense in that. I'm not blaming it all on you. I'm not easy to live with, I know. I should have known from the start it wouldn't work. You made that pretty clear for me. Phil, that was before! Afterward, I promise, I... We've talked enough. I can't take it anymore! Just pack your things and get out! Phil! I'm positively through with men! I only liked you because you were fond of dancing! So for goodness sake, don't go getting any ideas into your head! I mean, I might have been interested in you, once, but after the way Jack and Fred treated me, especially Fred, why, it's enough to put a girl off men for life! Oh, Mike! Mike, it's lovely! Hello, Eve. Eve! - Have you seen Alec? - No. I rang his flat, he's not there. I've got to see him! What's the matter? Anything I can do? What's the matter? - Nothing, please, leave. - Eve, please! Phil wants to divorce me. That's absurd! He means it. He's going to see the lawyers right away. He can't! On what grounds? Mary, I didn't go with Alec. Not after Phil and I were married. I know that, Eve. He won't believe it! How can I make him believe it? There must be some way. If Alec could talk to him... Wait here, I'll see if I can find him. Mary, look! Oh, Georgie, it's lovely! It's too big. I should get it fixed, but I wanted to show off. Look, I have to hold my handkerchief so it doesn't fall off! - Have you seen Alec? - No. If you do, will you tell him that Eve is here, upstairs? Oh, I must show her! No, Georgie, some other time. - Where are you going? - I'll be back. - Carole! - Georgie! Snap! No, no, Mary, it's no good! She doesn't love me, she never has! Alec's the one she goes for. The sooner it's all washed up, the better. I should never have married her. Well, it's just bad luck for both of us. I've been all sorts of a fool, you know, Mary. When I come back from Cardiff, you'll have to take me in hand, hm? - You could certainly do with a nurse. - I need you. - You need me? - I need you. I'll get you that address. Just spell everything with two L's, you'll be all right. Okay. Oh, and Mary... if Eve should want something, you'll let me know, will you? I won't write to anyone as stupid and cruel as you are. You're stupid, blind, self-satisfied and jealous! You take silly accidents, build them up, and don't listen when she explains! You're not listening to me now! Phil, you're so... thick-headed and smug! Eve loves you, she's heart-broken, she doesn't care for Alec, if you were a man, you'd know! Why can't you see things? - Listen to me! - I won't listen! Why don't you see I'm telling the truth, why should I lie to you? Why should I want for you and Eve to smash it up? Because I love you, Phil. But there never was a chance for me. You love Eve. And Eve loves you. Eve! Eve, what's wrong? You wanted to see me? Cause brother You're gonna need that kind of dough Now I kinda figure out this way She's hooked to you and you can't stray No sir, you're gonna hear Those church bells yet But brother when you walk down the aisle You'll find a sickly smile You ain't no stray dog now You're with a... There's only one difficulty. What's that? Me. This'll hand you a laugh: I'm jealous. No, please, Alec, don't be silly. You're the only one who can help me. I used to thank my lucky stars that I didn't care about anyone. Then I realised that nobody cared about me. I'm very fond of you. You don't give a hoot. Not really. None of you do. I get tired of people. Nobody lasts with me. You lasted longer than most. Oh, Alec, it's no good. It's too late. - Is it? I don't think so. - No, Alec! - I wanna marry you. - No! - Why not? - Phil! After the way he's treated you? I must have been an idiot to let you go. Oh, help me, Alec. To fix things up with him again? Why? If the runt thinks he has evidence, I won't contradict him. Alec, this isn't true, I never went back to you. Does the judge know? But Alec, you can't do this, you can't! - Can't I? - No, Alec! I love him, Alec, I love him! I don't know how to live without him! Oh, Phil! What's the matter, dear? Are you sick? No, I'm alright. There's a nurse, shall I get her? That's okay, Ida, leave her be. Please, I'm all right. Alec! - Have you seen Eve? - Yeah, I've seen her. - Where is she? - Upstairs. Cinderella boy! Everybody at the party, and they won't let him in. - Wait a minute. - What for? I went a bit crazy the other night. Maybe I had the wrong idea. You always had the wrong idea, chump. You want a girl to double-cross you keep nagging at her. You expect her to be a dirt, she does. - Let's get this straight. - Watch yourself. - Did Eve go with you while I was away? - What do you think? I don't believe you. I haven't got all night, make up your mind, the last... You're just a cheap little... She didn't, did she? She didn't. She didn't. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, I hate you, I hate you! Happy new year!
