Come on. Come on, mutt. Now, look at that ball. All right. Come on. Get that ball. Ah- There's no problem with that. Oh, God damn it. If it happens, let me know. What the hell are you doing here? This is not the office. - This is my private time. - Five minutes. No-I said no Tuesday, I said no last week... and I'm gonna keep sayin' no till you hear me. Five minutes, Mr Chairman. It's all I ask... five minutes. - Want some coffee? - No, I don't want any coffee. I want to play with my dog. Look, I'm not asking you to vote for it. I know you can't. Just release your people. Let them go the way they want. Telecommunications Security and Privacy Act- Invasion of privacy is more like it. You read the Post? "This bill is not the first step toward the surveillance society." It is the surveillance society." Uh, liberal hysteria. Oh, listen. I'm not gonna sit in Congress... and pass a law that lets the government... point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well please. Phil, look. I don't care who bangs who... what cabinet officers get stoned. But this is the richest, most powerful nation on Earth, and therefore the most hated. And you and I know what the average citizen does not: that we are at war 24 hours of every day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do I have to itemize the number of American lives we've saved... in the past 12 months alone with judicious use of surveillance intelligence? Thomas, cut the crap. I've got three major employers... in the Syracuse area alone who are gonna get just killed by this bill. I promise to get you funds equal to or greater than... whatever those companies gave your last campaign. I'm not talking about campaign contributions, damn it. I'm talking about my constituents being out of work. Jesus, man-Wake up- National security isn't the only thing going on in this country. God. This conversation is over. I beg of you, Phil. Please don't. I've been there for you in the past, haven't I? There have been times... personal situations, when you needed my assistance and my confidence. Are you blackmailing me, you ambitious shit? I'm sorry we can't find a common ground on this one, Congressman. You're a good man. People of your district are lucky... to have you representing them. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let me fight management. Okay, I can accept that. But this is our own goddamned union leadership... tryin' to railroad us into signing some, some sweetheart contract. Look... Look, everybody knows... that, that the mob has been controlling these guys since, since as long as I can remember. And now, uh... now we got Pintero's goons down there tuning up my people. Well, first off, that's a Hobbs Act violation, probably a RICO. - Hey. - How you doing, Eddie? - Thanks. - How you doin'? - Great. - All right. - Thanks. - Robert Dean. - Tony O'Neill. Nice to meet you. A Hobbs and a RICO. Ooh, baby, don't stop. Sounds like you guys need a labour lawyer. What happened? We were in Louie's two nights ago. I go to use the bathroom... and these two fuckin' guidos jump me. Uh, I prefer we use the term "Italian-Americans." Eh, whatever, but they were really goin' to work on me. It could've gotten serious. But then Larry Cash came in and he went after 'em. Uh, Larry Cash is in the hospital... with a broken jaw and a ruptured kidney. Is this becoming a criminal investigation, Robert? Um, no, it would take years to see that thing through. Besides, these people have families that are living through this every day. Hey, Julie, can we send a case of Chianti over to Larry Cash? - Larry Cash? - Yes, he's at St. Luke's. And send some flowers to his wife, Brenda. They're both in the Rolodex. Yes, Mr Dean. Well, why don't you guys just head on home? All right. I'm your lawyer. I'm in the process of dealing with these guido motherfuckers. Pintero doesn't stand a chance. So, how's the trout? - Tastes like fish. - It is fish. No, I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Okay. Brill's note said that this is the videotape that you need to convince Pintero with. And watch out for the FBI. Brill says the place is under surveillance. - So when do I get to meet him? - Pintero? Brill. Never. Okay. Um... Wow. That's not exactly the answer I was hoping for. Oh, and what was the answer you were hoping for? Oh, I don't know. Soon. Uh, definitely sooner than never. Bobby, why do we have to go through this every time? Brill talks to me, I talk to you. That's the way it works. Well, pardon me for being a little uncomfortable... with hiring someone that I don't know and I've never even met. Then don't hire him. Ten thousand dollars. And I'm also a little uncomfortable havin' to carry that kind of cash around. Well, this should lighten your load. I don't know if it's Brill's price that's goin' up or your commission. I take 15%, as always. Brill's fee varies with risk. Maybe you'd be more comfortable using someone else. - What, other than Brill? - Other than me. - What's wrong with you? - Oh, there's nothing wrong with me. Just, you know, someone with whom you don't have quite so complicated a history. I like our history, and I like you. I like you too. Look, I-I just want to make sure that I'm not breaking the law in any way. - You're not. - And how can I be so sure? Because I wouldn't let you. So, Mr Pintero, the guy on the left is Carl Matthews, president of Local 6650. And this is Dave Early, secretary-treasurer of the National. Oh, right there, you see... You see the guy there? Uh, that's Hugh Simic. He administers the pension fund. Hey, you're going to recognize this fellow right here. That's you. Am I correct, Mr Pintero? That ain't me. Let's watch a little more of this. - Take a... Take a picture of this. - Everybody say "money." Here comes a great shot right here. Wait. Everybody say "not guilty." Right here; here it comes. - That's not you? - That ain't me. Well, you know, that-that's actually really great news for me. It lifts a huge weight off of my shoulders. Because, you know, the conditions of your parole specifically forbid you... from having any contact of any kind with any union officials. I know that. Well, I'm... I'm saying, so hypothetically... had that been you, I mean, you'd be headed back to prison for... 15... I don't know... Maybe 20 years... even more. But, you know, I mean, that ain't you, as you so eloquently put it. Are you fuckin' with me? Eloquently? That's not me. Oh, that's not you. Well, I'm sorry that I've wasted your time, gentlemen... you know, since that's not you, um... Oh, you know what? I'm thinkin'. Maybe I'll just, you know... run this tape past the federal prosecutor. You know, they have really great VCRs down there. A lot of times, they can see some things that we can't see. You ain't runnin' this by nobody. What do you want? My clients want to vote their contract up or down... as they see fit, without, shall we say, any outside influences. Okay. Sit down. - No, I'm fine, thank you. - No, you are not fine. Now sit your ass down. I would like my clients to be able to exercise their constitutional rights. And if that happens, that tape will disappear forever into my private collection... along with the Zapruder film and the porno from Hitler's bunker. - Do you got any copies of this thing? - Absolutely. Who made it? You make it? I'm an attorney. I don't make videotapes. Now you listen to me, you fuckin' eggplant. This fuckin' videotape may save your clients' asses... but you can be goddamned sure it ain't gonna save yours. Now, who made the fuckin' videotape? - I don't know. - How'd you get it? Through an acquaintance. Mr Dean, he's got acquaintances. Me, I got friends. I don't know. Vic, get outside. See if they're any acquaintances out there... that are of the black persuasion. Carlos, why don't you get out of that chair? Talk to Mr Dean. Who's your fucking acquaintance? Listen to me. I wanna know who made that videotape... but I wanna know in a week... or I'll kill ya. Hey, smile. - What? - Smile for the FBI. Who's the brother? I don't know, but he doesn't look Italian to me, does he? Table Harvest to 101. We got a blue overcoat heading east. Give me a loose one. See if we can get his plates. I'm standing by live at the Lockraven Reservoir right now... where police and fire officials are in the process of removing... a classic Mercedes owned by Republican Congressman... Phillip Hamersly of Syracuse, New York. This accident comes at a very untimely juncture... since the congressman was working on a controversial piece of legislation, Dale... opposing the Telecommunications Security and Privacy Act. Fire officials do tell me that it appears the congressman... was by himself in the car. We have confirmed that. However, strangely enough... his favourite dog, Bob, is currently with police. I understand there was a history of heart problems. There was, in fact, a history of heart problems. In fact, the congressman endured open-heart surgery just a couple of years ago. Homicide investigators have told me they did find a bottle of pills in his lap. That might mean that the congressman... And I speculate here... May have suffered a heart attack before going into the Lockraven Reservoir. He leaves behind a family of four. We'll have more details as the story develops. I need a 10-27 on a... brown and tan '75 GMC Jimmy. D.C. tags. Eight, kilo... six, three, nine, four. And a 10-28 on the registered owner. Jake, please do not give me optimistic numbers. I hate optimism. Sir? I want to know how many votes we have in the bank... aren't gonna change their mind every time the wind blows. Thank you. We may have a problem out at the lake. This is Daniel Zavitz. He's a nature photographer who was in government grants. One of them is for monitoring migratory patterns of Canadian geese. Or lack thereof. The box is called a hide. It contains a motion-activated... digital video camera with a compound lens. It was aimed directly at the boat ramp across the lake. We need two techs with full electronic capabilities... two humpty-dumpties. Get Fiedler to organize it, and call Kramer... to get us some ex-military cutouts. How do I describe the project? Call it a training op hosted here. Set up a link with the NRO. - That's good. - Falsify FBI approval. And none of this goes beyond our team. And get that videotape. - Of course. - Get a wire on our bird-watcher. You got it. Fiedler, it's Hicks. I need an intercept on a Daniel Leon Zavitz. 202-555-0108. And, uh, what's our authorization? We're calling it a P-1 training op. FBI approval. Krug and Jones, sir. We were with the 22nd Marine expeditionary unit. Kramer sent us. Oh, nice haircut. Thirty months in a federal penitentiary... at Marion, Illinois, for a GVH-1... on your gunnery sergeant... what's that about? The guy was an asshole, sir, and he deserved it, if you'll excuse me. All new, designed for today. The electric car is here. A sedan for you. I'm standing by live at the Lockraven Reservoir... right now, where police and fire officials are in the process of removing... a classic Mercedes owned by Republican congressman Phillip Hamersly. You may be able to see it here, being removed in the background. Now, fire and police officials aren't saying much at this point. Here's what I do know. I have been told that the congressman... was alone in the vehicle when this accident happened just under an hour ago. You may know that the congressman suffers from a heart condition. Homicide investigators have told me that they did find a bottle of pills in his lap. That might mean that the congressman... And I speculate here... May have suffered a heart attack before going into the Lockraven Reservoir. I am also told that there was no one in the car with him at the time of the... Fuck a duck. However, curiously enough, the congressman's dog Bob... Holy shit- on the ground, and is currently with police. He's from Syracuse, New York. The congressman was a key opponent to the Telecommunications Security and Privacy Act. - News desk. - Lenny... you are not going to believe what I have in my possession. - Zavitz. Long time. - Lenny, I've got... the Phil Hamersly murder on videotape. Phil Hamersly died of a heart attack. Negative. Hamersly was professionally wasted under the direction... of some anal-retentive with what looks like a serious vitamin D deficiency. Well, how did you get this tape? My conservation study at the lake photographed the murder. - You're kidding me... The camera was aimed straight across at the pier... right where Phil Hamersly was killed. - How fast can you get that tape over here? - I'm making a copy right now. Uh, Mark, I have to take this. Good. Thank you. Call if you need anything. - Fiedler, is this line secure? - Yes, it is, sir. - Go ahead. Zavitz is speaking to a Lenny Bloom... a former anti-war activist. He publishes a variety of left-wing newsletters on various political subjects. He's taking the tape now to Bloom's offices. Over. Put a tap on Bloom. And give us a dedicated satellite for this operation. It's already done. Yeah, so, Julie, I'm gonna take the rest of the day. Uh, finish up my Christmas shopping. Take my mind off things. Hey, do chicks dig lingerie? All right. I'll see you in the morning. - Hi. - Hi. How you doin'? Why, hello. - Hi. - Hey, hi. - Can I help you? - Uh, yes. - Do you see something you like? - Uh, I'm married. - That's allowed. Uh... Uh, um, I just... I need... I need some... uh, a... a Christmas present. For your wife? Yes, of-of several years. We're ver... We're, uh, yes. - So you want some lingerie for your wife? - Yes, yes, I-I would. Do you like Christian Dior? You know, I have to be really honest with you. Um, I'm not really experienced in this. - I don't... - Get out of town- I-I mean, don't get me wrong. I mean, I'm-I'm experienced, you know, from... - Yeah. - from a certain perspective. - Right. - I-I just... You know, I don't want to come in here and, you know, look stupid. Too late. - Yeah. What size? - I'm sorry? - Oh, my wife. Oh. - Yeah. - Uh, she-she's, um... - She's about, uh... She... - Size six. Yeah, right, she's, uh... She's ab... She's a six. Right. And what about cup size? Um... Oh-Oh, she's way bigger than that. I mean, uh, not... I mean, not noticeably. - Oops. - Should have gotten her a watch. - So far... - Hello? - It's me, Ruthie. - Shit. - Uh, they disconnected my phone again. Uh, mine's not working either. I think it's a problem with the line. Um... Let me borrow some change for the pay phone, man. Come on. I gotta call Dr Mike. Danny- Danny, I always pay you back. Come on- Danny- Open the door- Shit. Fuck. - Come on, man- - Uh, one minute. - I'm goin'. - Come on, Danny- Come on. Come on. Oh, shit. Ah, shit. It's not working. I got him-I got him- He's rabbiting- He's out the back. Give me real-time imagery coverage at LAT 38, 55, LONG 77, 00. Got it. Base, this is local control. Request immediate keyhole visual tasking. Maximum resolution. LAT 38, 55, LONG 77, 00. Over. Roger that. I'll need a minute on satellite visual. Over. Run, run, Danny- They got guns-Go- - Where is he? - He's on the roof. Right there. Go- - Okay, satellite imagery coming through. - Roger that. Patch visual, my location. Confirm visual. Thank you much. Air One, ahead. All units: Target heading north on rooftop. Columbia and 18th. Request immediate visual support. Over. Roger that. We have visual. Everybody move. He just jumped to the adjacent building. All units, he is entering rear entrance... Entering entrance of Captain Ike's. - Captain Ike's. - Roger. Get out of the way- Hey- Air One, be advised, suspect heading towards front entrance. Front of Columbia. - Detail front of building on Columbia. - Copy that. I got him-I got him- All units, target entering the barber-shop. - Hah-Bullshit-We lost him; we lost him. - We've lost him- I can't... Units in pursuit, target seen exiting rear of barber-shop in alley. Follow. - Okay, I'm blank. I can't see anything. - Air One, we've lost the visual. - I'm blank. What do you got? - Who's got him? Zavitz-Dan Zavitz- Hey, uh... It's me, Bobby Dean. We were at Georgetown together. You okay? - Help me. - Are you hurt? - What do you think of this one, sir? Yeah, this is Becky. Becky, say hi. I'm s... Can I have one second, please? Oh, he's right on top of Pratt. He's running from Pratt on Connecticut. - Pratt, he's on your 6:00. Turn around. - Got him- Move, move, move. Get out of the way- Hey, hey- Come back, man-Come back- Hey, I got him- Target northbound... Northbound on Connecticut. Okay, got him. Go, go, go, go- Switching targets. Switching. Now heading southbound towards DuPont circle. Stop- Target down on Connecticut Avenue. Air One, confirm. Target is down. Target is down permanently. - What happened? - A guy on a bike got creamed. Oh, Jesus. - I'm beatin' you. - Yeah, right. - Oh, you are. - Oh, sh... - Hey, hey... I'm beatin' you. - No, I'm beatin' you. - I just caught up. - Hello. - Oh, yeah? - Hi, Mr Dean. Am I in the wrong house? I'm looking for an eight-year-old boy, about yea high. - Kinda good-looking. Allegedly my son. - No. - Hmm. Maybe he's behind the TV. - Eric? - Mr Dean... Dad- - Eric? - Mr Dean, get out- - Get out of the way- What? What? Oh, I'm sorry. - Are those my Christmas presents? - Yep, some of 'em. - Can I open 'em? - Yeah, sure. Here you go. - Seriously? - In your dreams, buddy. Beat it. - Dad- Are you staying for dinner tonight, Dylan? If it's okay with you. - Got any money? - Money? - He's kidding. - I'm going to sleep over at Dylan's, okay? - Did you ask your mother? I was going to, but she's too busy yelling at the TV. Oh, well, there goes the Fourth Amendment... what's left of it. - Hey, Maria. - Hello, Mr Bobby. Don't you honestly doubt that the average citizen... Hey, you're about a bark-and-a-half from being homeless. Baby, listen to this fascist gas bag. - Uh-oh. -...and freedom have always existed in a... In a very precarious balance, and when buildings start blowing up, people's priorities tend to change. - He's got a point there, sweetie. - Bobby- I mean, who is this idiot? He is talking about ending personal privacy. Do you want your phone tapped? I'm not plannin' on blowing up the country. Well, how do we know until we've heard all your dirty little secrets? You're just gonna have to trust me. Oh, I know. We'll just tap the criminals. We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people. - Right. - Then who decides which is which? I think you should. You know, Bobby, I think you should take this more seriously. Honey, I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us... and half the people on the block. Tens of millions of foreign nationals living within our borders... and many of these people consider the United States their enemy. - And they see acts of terrorism as... - You remember Daniel Zavitz? - We were at Georgetown together? - Vaguely. - I saw him today. - How's he doing? - He's dead. - What? He got hit by a fire engine pretty much in front of my eyes. Oh, my God- I ran into him in a store, and he was upset about something. - About what? - I don't know. Before we had a chance to talk about it, he ran out of the store... and next time I saw him, he was dead. Baby-Come here. Ohh, I love you so much- I love you, too, sweetie. Oh, that's not even to mention the gangster that threatened to kill me today. - Hah-Very funny- - Oh, you think? Hilarious. - Hmm. What'd you get me? - A bowling ball. No more of that MSNBC terrorist talk. You're scaring the kids. We'll be back with your phone calls for Congressman Sam Albert right after this. Tell me. Zavitz is dead. So is Lenny, the guy from the paper. What about the tape? We found the original in Zavitz's apartment. - The original? - There was a copy. - There was a copy? - I think so, sir. - Any more good news? They never made it to the newspaper, but there was a private sector contact. - Who was that? - Several indiscriminants and one primary. - Who? - Robert Dean. He's a D.C. Labour lawyer. Lives in Georgetown with his wife, Carla Dean. She's also an attorney. She's with the ACLU, as it happens. Well, I suppose he could've given it directly to Bob Woodward. Maybe we dodged a bullet. Find out what Dean knows. - Make contact. - Yes, sir. I hate doing this at Christmas. Fiedler, we need a complete FinCEN, EPIC... and a DRD work-up on a Robert Clayton Dean. His social's 986-26-0901. Pull up keyhole data files, okay? Let's go- Let's get this show on the road- Eric, just call me in the morning when you want me to come pick you up. You know, if you decide you want to stay at Dylan's till the end of the weekend... or the end of the century, your mom and I have discussed it. It'll be difficult initially, but we think we can live with it. Dad's kidding. He's gonna miss you, just like me. Honey, hurry back. You know what that means. Mm-hmm. That you're gonna be asleep when I get back. That only happened one time, sweetie. We're running a comprehensive database search. Brian did a preliminary analysis and comparison... and he came up with some pretty interesting stuff. Thanks, Brian. Thank you. Prioritize his phone bill. Who's he been calling? - Oh, man. Check this one. - Who? Rachel F-For-You-Know-What Banks. God, would I love to have her ruin my life. Do a cross. They were at Georgetown together, sophomore year. They have the same address, same phone number. They remain close. Many calls, regardless of marriage. - Oh, here we go. - What? Dean, over the past 18 months... has four, five, seven cash withdrawals of 4,000, 5,000... and up, and up... and each time, the delectable Miss Banks... makes large cash deposits of her own within a day or two. Blackmail? Well, her deposits aren't the same, but let me figure this out. Ah, yes, they're exactly... exactly 15 percent of the amount Dean withdrew. Brian, can we get some more? I mean, you know, we got the blimp cam, we got the police officer cam... we've got, uh, two ATM cameras, but this is the one showing promise. This is the security camera at the underwear store. Freeze there. Rotate us 75 degrees around the vertical, please. Freeze there. Times ten. Focus on the drop. Enhance, then forward frame-by-frame. All right. Now, just before the view's blocked, there's a shape change in Dean's bag. See the shadow variance? See? The shadow's wrong. Zavitz changed the configuration of Dean's packages. Is it a tape? It's hard to say for sure. These things are... Can the computer take us around to the other side? It can hypothesize. Chris? Yeah? Can you rotate us 75 degrees around the vertical, please? - What do you think it is? - It looks a lot bigger than a tape. Zavitz had digital compression equipment in his apartment. He could've downloaded it to anything. Or maybe the bag twisted in Dean's hand. Or something moved in front of the light and altered the shadow. Maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's everything. Let's get it and find out. Beat it. I got work to do. Go. Porsche- Go away- Damn it, Porsche- - Hello, Mr Dean? - Uh, yes. Can I help you? This is Detective Benning. I'm Pratt. We're with D.C. Metro. Uh, sorry to bother you at home, sir. We were just hoping to ask you a few questions about Daniel Zavitz. Wh... I'm s... Can I see your badges, please? Certainly, sir. Sure. All right. Come on. Back up, Porsche. All right. Nice and smooth. Come on, boys. Okay. I didn't really see the accident. I don't know whose fault it was. Oh, we're not here to talk about the accident, Mr Dean. I'm sorry, I thought you said you were here... We should apologize for the confusion, sir. It's just that we're handling a different aspect of the inquiry. Um, it turns out Mr Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. What kind of watch is that? Did you represent Mr Zavitz as an attorney? - It's an Omega. No, I didn't. So you're not constrained by attorney-client privilege? - Shh-shh. Yeah, that's correct. - You see, Mr Dean... we have reason to believe that Mr Zavitz may have passed sensitive materials to you. What kind of materials? Well, sensitive, so we're hoping that you could tell us that. Uh, no, he-he didn't pass me anything. These voice stress points indicate a really high degree of anxiety. - Anxiety about what? - That's the nature of physics. If he'd have given me something, I would've known. - Oh, he's lying- - What about your packages, sir? Could something have slipped in amongst the purchases without your knowledge? Excuse me. Daniel Zavitz did not give me anything. - That's a Parker pen. - It's a Mont Blanc. He didn't secrete it into any of my bodily orifices. - Whatever it is, I don't have it. - Could we look at them? - I don't think so. Not without a warrant. - Oh, Christ. - This guy's good. - How did you happen to be at Ruby's today? I was shopping for some lingerie. That's still legal, isn't it? You buying that for your wife? No, I was, uh, picking something up for myself. I do a little cross-dressing on the weekends. You know, you'd be surprised... how a nice pair of edible panties can make a guy feel sexy. We thought it might be for Rachel Banks. Good night, gentlemen. - Good night, sir. - Good night, Mr Dean. What are they talking about, Porsche? There's nothing here. Honey, I'm home. Uh, yeah, uh, just a second, sweetie. Well, either he's getting ready to do something with it, or he doesn't know he has it. Or he doesn't have it. You know what I've seen? I've seen killers walk free because the eyewitness was an alcoholic. I've seen sex offenders that couldn't be touched because the victim was a call girl. Credibility... It's the only currency that means anything on this kind of playing field. Dean's got the tape, and he's gonna come out with it; and when he does, I want his credibility. I want people to know he's lying before they hear what he says. We could take his wife and kid. He'd give it up for them. We'd have the police and the FBI all over this in 24 hours. Put taps on his 20 most frequently called numbers, and let's get into his life. The union situation has... Has mob written all over it. And he's definitely vulnerable on Rachel Banks. I want to know about his wife, I want to know about his parents... I want to know about his gambling problems, his urine samples, his porno rentals. I want to use every means possible to get what we need... because this little son of a bitch is not going to be the final chapter of my life. - Tell me something. - Uh-oh. How did you find out Pintero was associated with union officials? I'm just that good. I hired an investigator. - Hey. - Shut up the dog- My mom used to have one of these. Come on. Ow-The dog bit me- - Oh, who was the investigator? - Wh... I... What do you mean? His name? Come on, Bobby. You know what I'm asking. Is it the guy who Rachel knows? Ca... Why do we... Why do we have to go through this every time? Bobby, I'm just asking, okay? Carla, Rachel Banks is not an issue any more. You are the only woman in the world for me. You and Janet Jackson. I-I have to be honest. If-lf Janet Jackson called me... I w... I... I might have to change my last name to Jackson. Yeah, right. I'd have to break that woman's legs too. Lower, lower, like kids would do it, damn it. You sound like a fuckin' old lady. Shut up. Ooh, sensitive. All right. Jones has some issues we need to resolve. - Oh. Hey, Control, they are home. - Uh-oh. Move, guys. Oh, nice blender. Oh, my God. Oh, Porsche. Oh, damn. The dog is green. Jones painted the... the dog- This is Robert Dean, 2811 Sutton. I'd like to report a break-in. I don't know. Um, it's been vandalized. From the looks of it, I-it's kids... but I need a squad car here immediately. Here we go. We'll be checking out the rest of the house, sir, ma'am. At least they left me one. How do you know it wasn't Pintero? I don't. It was just kind of frivolous. I guess I'm just hopin' it was kids. John. What have we here? I think we have a winner. Phone for phone. - Take any of your clothes? - No. They threw all my shoes and suits in the tub... and spray painted my damn dog. - Black. - Black. Perfect. How does that look? Paging Mr Dean. We have you bugged, Mr Dean. They thrashed my computers, my big-screen TV... They took my blender. - What about jewellery? - Nope. - What about silverware? - Nope. Just my blender. - Blender, huh? - Loved that blender. You know, I did stuff when I was a kid. I mean, not breaking-and-entering, but, you know, stuff. Yeah, we all did stuff. I just wish they hadn't stolen my damn blender. You seem a little attached to this blender, Robert. Yeah, well, some people meditate, some people get massages. - I blend. - You're really weird, you know that? Yeah, then on top of it, the only suit they leave me is three years old. Hasn't gotten any better with age. Blow over? I'm not... I'm not gonna sit around and wait for this to blow over- Jerry, I... I'm, I'm suing their right-wing asses right into Chapter 11- This is flagrant-They never even called to see what my side of the story was- - They have no Sullivan protection with this... Mr Dean? - Yes. - Rachel Banks is on line one... and, uh, Silverberg and Blake would like to see you in the conference room. All right. Uh, Jerry, uh, I got to take this call. All right. Hey, what's up? My firm called me this morning telling me not to come in. - What? Why not? - I don't know. Reporters are calling, asking me about my relationship with you... and how long I've worked for the mob. - The mob, Bobby. - Jesus. Do you know how hard I worked to get this job? Yeah, I know. I know. Mr Dean, Silverberg and Blake are still waiting to see you in the conference room. - I heard you the first time. Thank you. - Look. You got your own problems. Uh, no, Rachel. It's fine. Oh, g... I just got off the phone with a source that I trust. A grand jury is being convened to look into your labour practise... as far back as the electrical workers' strike. And why is that? They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Villotti in Zurich... and that through your continuing relationship, the Peitso family has been able... to exert influence and provide false witness to discredit our case. - Oh, well, that's true. - You're admitting it? Sure. Everything except setting up a company in Zurich... or even knowing anyone named Sam Villotti... or having any relationship whatsoever to the Peitso family- - This is ridiculous... Robert... - Uh, Mark, I'm tell you. This is Pintero. He's coming back after me. You give me one week... one week and four guys from litigation... and I guarantee you, we have this guy begging us... Tell us about Rachel Banks. Tell you what. Uh, she was my girlfriend the second year of law school. We keep in touch. We-We toss one another some work every once in a while. Uh, that's it. Did you have an affair with her four years ago? You ever beat off in the shower, Brian? Hmm? You ever have any homosexual thoughts? Bobby, that is... None of my fucking business-You're damn right it's not- I love my wife, and I love my son absolutely... with no equivocations, and that's none of your fuckin' business either- Uh, we think that you should take a leave of absence... until we're able to, uh, sort all this out. - Are you firing me? - I think you just fired yourself. Carla- Where is she, Jen? Don't go in there. She doesn't want to talk to you. Why not? Because she's reading the paper. - Asshole. - Carla... - How could you let me find out like this? - I'm findin' out like this. This is all lies. Th... None of this stuff is true. So you're saying you weren't there with her? Yes, I had lunch with her. We have lunch once a month. She's the contact for the investigator, Brill. You were right about that. Someone must have taken this picture off the security camera outside the restaurant. - You said she wasn't an issue. - She's not-I have to see her for business. And I... And I knew if I told you that... Bobby, you had an affair with this woman-An affair. We went to a counsellor for a year- And now you're standin' there lyin' about even seein' her? You make me sick- Carla, I am smeared all over the newspapers for money-laundering schemes, mob ties... I lost my job. I am asking you... I'm asking you to please just trust me on this Rachel Banks thing right now. How in God's name can I trust you? Bobby, I want you to leave. - Carla, I'm telling you that this is all bullshit... I don't wanna hear anything else. I don't wanna hear anything else. I cannot think with you in my face. I want you to leave. - What do you need to think about? - Bobby, get out- - I'm telling you it's bullshit... Get out- Just leave, so I can think- For me, okay? Just leave. Just go, Bobby. Go. Go. - You want a blend? - Yeah. Thanks. Hi. Hi. Uh, I'd like to have a room for the evening, please. Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry, sir. This card was declined. Declined? This is a brand-new card. Try it again, please. Yes, sir. You know, maybe it's not activated yet. Thank you. Run this one, please. Thank you. Yes, sir. No, it didn't go through. - But I'll try it again. - N-No, thank you. - My briefcase is gone. - Excuse me, sir? - My briefcase was right here. - Are you sure you brought it in? Yes, I'm sure I brought it in- Hi. This is Rachel. Leave a message after the beep. Hey, Rachel, it's Bobby. Uh, I need to talk to you... and I need to talk to you face-to-face. Uh, meet me tomorrow, 11:00 a.m., Mount Vernon Square. I'll see you then. Yes. All right, we're moving into phase two of the training op. Selb's gonna brief you on it, so listen up, all right? We're gonna be following the subjects through the square. We're gonna have three listening stations and two video surveillance units with unidirectional mikes. Pratt, you're three. Jones, Fiedler, Krug... you guys are at ground level. You'll be following the targets. You move when I say, you go when I say. All handoffs go on my command. Now, for the uninitiated, if we don't have line-of-sight... we can't hear what they say, right? - Right? - Yeah. Got it. - All right. You guys clear? - Yeah. - Yeah. Jones, Krug, what, are you guys from communications? - No, we're ops. - You can tell by their haircuts. I would like to sit down with Mr Pintero in private... so he and I can discuss what's happening to me. I called; they said he was here. Mr Pintero would like to help you. - But he won't. - And why not? Well, because first, you haven't told him who made the tape... and second, we've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars... on shyster lawyers just like you... because of shyster lawyers just like you. Actually, I believe the slur "shyster"... is generally reserved for Jewish attorneys. I believe the proper slur for someone like myself... would be, uh, "eggplant." Boom. This kid gets brighter every time I see him. You said 11:00 sharp. I know. Uh, Christmas traffic is horrible. You know, it's not so smart, us being seen together in public like this. Do we have anything to hide? Heavy background on one. Could we do better on audio two? - Unfortunately not. - Two is better. IRS contacted me this morning. - Two, you're good. Hold position. - They say my lifestyle exceeds my income. Ohh. You're being audited? For the last four years. What's going on, Bobby? Uh, look, don't worry about that. W... My firm will represent you completely free of charge. - Eighty percent. - You don't work there any more, remember? It's a temporary situation. - Your 80's becoming a 20. Bullshit. - Move to audio three. - On three. Much better. Much better. - We're screwed. - Wake up, one. - We are out. Rachel, I'm going to fix this. - How? - Tell me about Brill. Did he say "Bill"? No, "Brill," with an "R." - I can't do that. Cross-reference Rachel's file. See if the name "Brill" comes up. Got it. Rachel, don't you see that he is the key to this whole mess? From the second you gave me that tape, my life has been falling apart. You assured me that this-this guy was legit. - You needed information; I got it for you. - Two, you're good. Hold position. - Three is good. - This conversation is over. Okay, here we go. - What are you gonna do? You gonna wander around... Two, you gotta do better. - Want your job back... - Shit. - Do you want your life back? I don't have a life. I'm in love with a married man. Okay, I have 'em on the bench. Rachel, I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do about that. What makes you think it's you? It's not me? I j... I just as-assumed from... - You're a moron, you know that? - Yes. I know. Rachel, you're gonna have to tell me about Brill. Let's get outta here. All right. They're on the move. - Comin' to three. - Stay with 'em. - I got 40's, 20... You're following through trees. Two, can you track them? I lost line-of-sight. - Repeat, I have lost line-of-sight. - Three, you've got nothing. Lost line-of-sight. I'm out. We lost audio. It's gone. But we have his tracers. We can still follow 'em. When I need to reach Brill, I... I chalk the mailbox outside my house. When he crosses the mark, I make the drop. The location's always the same... Same time, same place. 3:00 p.m. ferry to Gibson Island. - You ever see him in person? - He's the cautious type. He's not gonna like you trackin' him down. The drop is behind seat 32. I leave something; he picks it up later. I'm sorry it took so long. I had to make sure you weren't being followed. - Brill. - Brill's dead. Died of smallpox when he was two. Buried in a field in Kansas. - What is that? - It's a bug-sweeper. - Take off your left shoe. - What does it mean when... Take off your shoe. I don't have time to explain. Take off your shoe right now. Come on. It's a beacon transmitter. Thousand-yard range. They're close. Let's go. Who is "they"? And why are they puttin' things in my shoes? No, get in the back, like you're a customer. Everything's gone... The wife, job... bank accounts, everything. You said Zavitz was behind an extortion scheme? - No, they said it. - You were the last one that talked to him? Yeah. - What did he say? He didn't say anything. He said, uh, "Help me, Bobby." Help me with what? I don't know. We never got around to that. - What did he give you? - Nothing. He didn't give me anything. Listen, you gotta come clean. If you bullshit me, I can't help you. No-I'm tellin' ya, he didn't give me anything. Nothing. A name? A phone number? No, nothing- He didn't give me anything- Who the hell is that? Oh, just somebody trying to get our attention. Well, he's doing a good job. Two-zero-nine to anybody. I need help. Who you calling? I thought you worked alone. Just shut up a second. - Stay exactly where you are. - Hey- Look what you did to my car- Shit- Okay, gentlemen, we have a subject entering the structure on the northeast corner of Chambers and Light. That's 105 Chambers Avenue. - Run a check on all six tracers. - All six tracers are operative. Call up geo-position. - Yeah, I got it. No problem. Task keyhole their coordinates. All right. LAT, 39 degrees, 14 minutes. LONG, 74 degrees, 39 minutes. - Hello. - Carla, don't hang up on me. Robert, do you know what I'm looking at right now? Carla, listen. Photographs of you and Rachel taken today. Is this true? Carla... Carla, how did you get the pictures? By messenger, Robert- By messenger. - What does it matter? - Look, all right, um... Some... Something's going on. I don't... I don't know who it is. Robert, I went to the store today... and my ATM and my credit cards didn't work. - I know. Mine either. - I couldn't buy food. - I gotta go. - What do you mean you gotta go? - Carla... Carla, I gotta... I gotta go. - Robert, wait a minute. Get on the fucking elevator. Oh, really? Got vertical movement here. Elevator. He's in an elevator. We're losing our tracking. - Anybody got a visual? We need to move location and get better signal. - I'm on it. - Are you guys there yet? - Negative. What the fuck is going on? - Shh. - Wait. They stopped. Hold it. - I don't know what your problem... - Shh. I'm getting high-frequency clutter. We lost tracers one, two and six. Their signals are completely dead. Something is wrong here. Get up. Tracers three, four and five are on their way up. He's getting help, boys. He's getting help. We had an arrangement. No contact. You broke the rules. They got to be heading for the roof. Air One, we need to establish visual on the rooftop... northeast corner, Chambers and Light. Copy that. Rooftop, northeast corner, Chambers and Light. Do you know how many federal agents you had following you on that ferry? - I-I don't... - Who are you working for? - What are you talking about? I'm not... Is that about me? Am I a target here? Do they know me? Who is "they"? Do they know me? -I don't know what you're talking about- You're either very smart or incredibly stupid. Get off. Come on. I got separating signals here. Tracer three is on its way down. Four and five are still together. Where did he go? How'd you find out about the ferry? Who set that up for you? Rachel did. Who was that other guy? - What did he say, exactly? - He said he was Brill. Did he say it or did you say it, and he picked up on it? Come on. Think. Shit, I said it. God damn it. You see, that's why I have rules. - Is all this about Pintero? - You think the mob uses devices like this? Excuse me, sir. Where are your elevators? Right over there. -In your phone was a GPS sat-tracker. - Pulse is at 24 gigahertz. - I don't know what that means. It's like a Lo Jack, only two generations better than what the police have. And what does that mean? Do you speak English? - Obviously not that well. You're kind of a jerk, aren't you? It means the NSA can read the time off your fucking wristwatch. All right. Enough of this bullshit. Right now, you either shoot me or tell me what the fuck is going on- Jones, you take the stairs. Krug, hold the perimeter. Come in on my signal. The National Security Agency conducts worldwide surveillance... Fax, phones, satellite communication. They're the only ones in the country, including the military, who could possibly have anything like this. - Why are they after me? - I don't know, and I don't wanna know. Here they come. I thought these sat dishes would scramble their signals. Control, this is Air One. Repeat coordinates. 105 Chambers Avenue. You're transmitting. They still have a signal on you. Your collar, your belt, your zipper. Get rid of your clothes. All of them. And then what am I supposed to do? Nothing. You live another day, I'll be very impressed. Two targets, rooftop, north side. Understood. Two targets, rooftop. Maintain visual, please. - You have something they want. - Look, I don't have anything- Maybe you do and you don't know it. You stay away from Rachel and you stay away from me. You come near either one of us, I'm gonna kill you. Get rid of your watch. - My wife gave me this for our anniversary. - Then keep it. Stay off the phone. Wait a minute. Either he just committed suicide here... Or he learned to fly. - Air One, stay with him. - Target's on the move. Satellite imagery coming through. One metre res layering wireframe coming your way. Over. Okay, gentlemen, we're back on-line. Okay. Wireframe download complete. All right. We have a tracer in the stairwell on 20 travelling down. Nineteen, eighteen... seventeen... Moving up- He's out of the stairwell on 17. Go to 17. Oh, shit. Shit. Mr Wu. - Target is holding on 17. Zoom three Mag. - Zooming. Mr Wu. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Hi. I'm from hotel hospitality and evaluation. Oh, no, no. No tip. I'm fine. Thank you. No tip. Hello. - Hi. I just wanna make sure that you folks have absolutely everything you need... - to be completely comfortable. - I got something here. - We got him. - Krug, Jones... get your asses up here to the 17th floor right now. That's really important to us here. Mr Dean? I'd like to talk to you for a second, if I could. Oh, shit. My clothes. - Shit- - Yeah. Mr Dean? Mr Dean, if you could just come to the door for a second, sir, we could work this all out. I can't... I got rabies or something. I can't do it. I can't do it. Let's go. - Okay, that's our last tracer. - Mr Dean- Let's not let this get out of hand. Let's not involve the hotel guests in this. Down, ma'am, sir. Sit down. Please? Thank you. Thank you. - Door- - Everything's gonna be all right, folks. Krug, balcony- Air One and Control, we got him. He's dropped to the 16th floor. Air One, visual support. Check perimeter, south side of the building. Ten-four, Control. We have visual. - He jumped to 15. Go to 15. - Go- Grab his clothes. Let's go, gentlemen. Weapons away. Go- Move- - Dean, open this door, God damn it- - What are you doing? Come on- Dean, come on now- We just wanna talk-Open this door- Open that door- - D.C. Metro. Our partner's trapped inside. - Yeah. We gotta evacuate this building- Control, Air One. We have approaching emergency vehicles. Team, the show's going public, and they're coming in the front door. Stand down. Maintain visual perimeter. This is Air One. We're outta here. We have a friend, Chavez, on the 15th floor. We got one man trapped and possibly down. Hey, there's a guy trapped in there- You're going to be okay, guy. You're going to be all right. Okay, we are travelling. Known destination? St. Elizabeth's. - St. Elizabeth's Hospital. - We need sat backup now. - It's already done. Hey. Take it easy, guy. You're going to be all right. Just calm down. Okay. Easy, fella. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Stop the ambulance. - Tell him to stop... Tell him to stop it now- - Pull over, George. - Easy, fella. - He's getting out-He's getting out- - Son of a bitch- He's escaped the ambulance and he's on foot. But our guys are in pursuit. - Task keyhole their coordinates. - All right. LAT 39 degrees, 27 minutes. LONG, 74 degrees, 42 minutes. - Move, guys. - Go, go, go-Damn it-Go around-Go around- - You're on. Go. - Tunnel Control, this is D.C. Metro. In pursuit armed felon loose in tunnel. Requesting video help. Metro, this is Tunnel Control. Yeah, we got a 20 on your suspect heading south in tunnel six. Copy that. Yeah, we got him, we got him. He's right in front of us. Uh, tunnel six. He's heading south down tunnel six. I got him. I got him. - He's got nowhere to go. He crossed over. He's on the wrong side. Stop-Stop- We lost him. We lost him. Son of a bitch-Pull over. He's currently entering vertical stairwell five. Where does that lead? Five leads to main access to sub-ventilation tunnel. Request closest vehicular access. Adjacent utility entrance, south side. - Copy that. Boys, he's in the ventilation tunnel. Proceed to the adjacent utility entrance on the south side. There is no visual coverage. They got him-They got him-He's in a ventilation tunnel- To the service entrance at the south end-Come on-Let's go- Come on-Go- - Normally, I wouldn't do this. - Do you guys have him? Talk to me, people. - Shit- - Shit- I don't understand why this is so difficult. He shed the sensors. He's clever. And he's had help. Maybe it's the real Brill. There's 23 Brills in the Baltimore/D.C. area. None of them check out. We're running it through the EPIC computer now. - Do you think we're being set up? - What, somebody in the agency? I don't know. It just tastes a little off, doesn't it? - I know what you mean. - Let's raise the stakes. Make things a bit more serious for Mr Dean. We'll both think about how, okay? Okay. Good. - Anything wrong? - No. You know, you should have made deputy director two years ago, maybe three. But it'll happen now. Once this bill passes, that'll be it for you. Thanks, Maria. Porsche, what are you barking at, boy? - Porsche? - Shh. Shh. Shh. Hey, it's me. It's me. I know it's you. You scared the shit out of me. The house is bugged. Electronically. Everything you say in there, they can hear and maybe even see. Listen to me. Listen, listen. I never... I sw... I swear to God. I never... Th-This is the truth. I never... Ever since the problem, I've never touched Rachel like that. I never... I never even looked at her like that, honey. I love you. I love you, and that is it. That is it. Only you. - What about Eric? - And Eric. And I love your family. Except for your dad. I need you. I need you real bad. I need you, okay? Okay. I told you, Bobby. I told you they had this type of capability. And that goddam privacy bill is just another way for them to expand the power. - Shh. - Don't you "shh" me. You were right. I was wrong. But this is not the time for the "I told you so" speech. That day when Daniel Zavitz got hit by the fire truck, he was running. H-He was scared. The same people... I know it now... the people that were chasing him, that's the people that are chasing me. Bobby, are you serious? I need you to go to Philadelphia. Stay there with your family. Ju-Just give me time to work this out. I'll get in touch with you. Oh, no. I don't think so. They're not chasing me out of my house. Uh-uh, Bobby. They're not chasing me... I picked those drapes- Shh, shh. Nobody cares about the drapes. Just one time can I make some decisions around here? Please? Just go to Philadelphia. I need you to do that for me, okay? - Okay. - I miss you. Oh, God. Oh, I miss you so much. You can't wear that. That's a Christmas present. I know. I'm sorry. But, baby, I missed you. I was lonely. How you just gonna go through my stuff like that? Baby, until I actually give it to you, that's still mine. Yeah, but it looks better on me, don't you think? Baby, you're as bad as Eric. I missed you so much. - What? - Oh, shit. That was the night. That was the night that I came home with the presents. - Where is Eric? - He's at Dylan's house. He's probably on the way to school. What? What's going on? What are you doing with that? - Shh. Here, baby. Shh, shh. No, no. No. I don't want it. I don't want it. Take it. Take it. - What do you want me to do with this? Get me some money. I need some clothes. Put it away. Okay. Okay. Tell Maria we need her car. Chances are they wouldn't have bugged it. Oh, shit. Eric. Base, this is unit one. The nanny is leaving. Please advise. Stay put. We have satellite tracking and Bingham at the school. Aw, man, let me follow the nanny. She doesn't shave her legs. Jesus- Women like that are so hot. - Is there anybody following us? - No. No, Mr Bobby. All right. Drive a little faster. I wanna catch 'em before they get to school. There they are. Pull up to them and tell them to get into the car. Okay. Eric, Dylan, get in the car, please. - No, we're okay. - Get in the car right now. But school's right down the block. You heard me. Now, get in. Come on-Come on. Throw it- - What's up, fellas? - Dad? No, no. Turn around. Sit down. Face forward. - But, Dad... - What did I say, Eric? You guys both pick a spot on those seats. We're gonna play a game. You pick a spot and look right at it. You can't let anyone know I'm back here, okay? How you been, E.? I missed you, man. I missed you, too, Dad. Where did you go? Oh, they've been keeping me really busy on this case. They're trying to work me to death out there. - Are you and Mom getting a divorce? - Face forward. What are you talking about? No, we're not getting a divorce. I mean, so we, we had a little fight. Sometimes married couples have fights. - That's nothing for you to worry about. - Who won the fight? This is your dad, Eric. You know when I put my foot down, that's it. My mom won. Look, I-I have a question I need to ask you... and it is absolutely imperative that you tell me the truth. Now, no matter what you say, I swear to you, you are not going to get in trouble. - All right? You ready? - Yeah. You remember that night I came home with those Christmas presents, and you asked me, could... I just looked in the bag, Dad. I wouldn't have taken it, except it was already open. All right, so we're clear. But I need it. And I promise I'll get you another one, Eric. - Dad. - What's the matter? - It's broken. It's not Eric's fault, Mr Dean. It was always broken. The screen just scrambles when you turn it on. All right, but I need it, guys. Do you have it here? Yeah, we have it. Eric, just pass it around the side to me. Yes. Hello. Hi. My name is Leon Newman. I'm sorry. What's your name, ma'am? Sergeant Miller. Yes, we live at 454 Beaumont Terrace. Actually, my mother lives there. I'm calling for her. There's been a-a van sitting outside all day, and... I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble or anything like that... but, uh, I think they might be doing drugs or-or something in there. I was hoping you could send a car by. Thirty-one Allison, all available units. Check out a white van at 454 Beaumont for a possible 1031 narcotics violation. - Oh, eat me. That's us. - Yep. Rachel. Rachel. Oh, shit. Open the door. Open the door- - All right, what happened? - Rachel's dead. I told you not to contact her. I told you. Get out of the car. I think I found what they're looking for. My son had it. Get out of the fucking car. Give me the toy. - You know why they killed her? - Trying to make it look like it was me. They... They had my stuff planted all over her house. First, if you're a murder suspect, you're gonna be easier to find... and second, to discredit you, in case you ever go public against them. The NSA set you up. It had nothing to do with Rachel. Absolutely nothing. - What do we got? - We got nothing. All right. Pull up everything we have on tape so far... The square, the house surveillance. Van, give me the sat imagery of the hotel roof. Okay, here. These are the parametrics for the space vehicle during data acquisition. Can we take a look at this guy who's helping him? Who is he? Can you get a feature extraction and pattern matching on him? Mm-mmm. He never looks up. - He's smart. - Why does he have to look up? The satellite's about 155 miles above the earth. It can only look straight down. - That's kind of limited, isn't it? - Well, maybe you can design a new one. Oh, maybe I will, idiot. Stay put. I need some food. I need to eat. Rockin' around the Christmas tree Let the Christmas spirit ring Later we'll have some pumpkin pie And we'll do some carolling You will get a sentiment... - Hello. - Yeah, it's me. - Oh, it's you, asshole. - What are you calling me for? - Shut up and listen. Go to the house. Go. Do not call Carla. Rachel Banks is dead. The papers will make it sound like I killed her. Tell her that I didn't do it. Make sure she goes. Get her out of there. Tell 'em I love 'em. The call is coming from 840 McClean, Baltimore, between Hood and St. Anne's. Copy that. Yes- What's up, man? We're gonna have to look at your surveillance tapes for the last 20 minutes. - Hey, Larry... The surveillance footage is coming in right now from Pratt. Freeze it and process it for face recognition. Pratt, do we see which way the car went? No, sir. This kid here at the register thinks that it might have went south. Unfortunately, the shot's too tight. I got make, uh, model and colour, but the plates are phony. - Order satellite coverage on this sector. - It's already done. - You planning a quick getaway? - Yeah, ever since I met you. Hate to see the chicken that lives in this coop. This is where I work. Might seem strange to you, but this has been my office for 15 years. It's completely secure. Copper wire mesh keeps the radio signals out. This is the satellite imagery of the convenience store 20 minutes ago. - They're in an EI Camino. - Eighty-six. There it is. John, give us LAT 30, 64 minutes, LONG 72, 29 minutes. - That's affirmative. - There they are. It's coming in from top left. Let's go in there and get them. I call it the jar. No phone or utility lines coming in. Self-contained. Unplugged from the world. Nothing for a wire bug to piggyback in on. That leaves only transmitters. It's easy enough to signal-sweep for those. Signal-sweeping for transmitters. You're just a party animal. See, the government's been in bed with the entire telecommunications industry since the '40s. They've infected everything. They can get into your bank statements... your computer files, your e-mail, listen to your phone calls. - My wife's been saying that for years. - Every wire, every airwave. The more technology you use, the easier it is for them to keep tabs on you. It's a brave new world out there. At least it better be. There it goes. It's some kind of simple encryption. Oh, conspiracy theorists of the world, unite. It's more than a theory with me. I'm a former conspirer. Yeah, I used to work for the NSA. I was a communication analyst. Listen to international calls, calls from foreign nationalists. That GPS tracking device we found in your cellular telephone? I designed one of the first models in that series. Fort Meade has 18 acres of mainframe computers underground. You're talking to your wife on the phone and you use the word "bomb," "president," "Allah"... any of a hundred key words, the computer recognizes it... automatically records it, red-flags it for analysis. That was 20 years ago. You know the Hubble Telescope that looks up at the stars? They've got over a hundred spy satellites looking down at us. That's classified. In the old days, we actually had to tap a wire into your phone line. Now calls bouncing off satellites, they snatch 'em right out of the air. What's this? - That's Phil Hamersly. - Jesus Christ. Who's this guy? I'm gonna check the executive NSA files. Let's run a photo ID on him. Reynolds, Thomas Brian. Born 9-11-40. Attended Episcopal School, D.C. B.A., Harvard, PhD, Princeton. On loan from the State Department since '95. This guy's not a professional. He's a politician. Aw, shit-Take that. When was the last time you contacted somebody you knew? When we stopped for food. Didn't I tell you not to use the telephone? I called from a pay phone. - What did I tell you? - You told me no calls. I told you no calls. - Get the cat. Get the cat. - Hey, man... - What's the cat's name? - Babe. Come here, baby. Come here, baby. Baby, come, come. Come here- Shit- God damn it. All right, baby, what do we got? What the... - Subjects exiting. - Williams, get the hell out of there. This bitch is gonna blow- Go, go, go-Move- Come on-Go- Move-Move-Move- Move-Move- - What the hell is happening? - I blew up the building. - Why? - Because you made a phone call- - Tell him to pull over- - Pull the vehicle over now- Pull over now- Pump action- Gosh damn- Fuel line must be broken. - Get it out-Get it out-Goddam- - Stop the car- - Where's the disk? - Shit- No-Shit- Look, is there any way to save it? - Ah, that's ruined. - What do we do? I'm leaving. Subjects heading west across the coal fields. What do you mean you're leaving? The disk is gone. We got nothing. It's over. We have control. Put down your weapons. You think I wanted that disk? You think I wanted that idiot to put that goddam thing in my... Who gives a fuck what you wanted? Since you've shown up, Rachel's dead and the NSA's onto me. Onto you? What do you mean onto you? Onto you about what, Brill? You're not the target. I am. This time we got him. We got him. He's right in front of us. Come on, come on. We got him. He's got nowhere to go. We got him. Air One to ground, they're somewhere between the trains. Get the fuck away from me. - Damn it- - We're coming back around. - You're blowing my whole life. - What life? You live in a fucking jar so the world can't touch you. And Rachel... You didn't give a shit about Rachel-Just some package under seat number 32 to you. - Come on... Do you have a problem? - Do it-Go on-Do it- I'm all you've got- And you're all I've got. Got 'em. Heading west towards the freeway. - Get out of the fucking car-Get out- - All right. - Come on. Get out. Move. - Don't do this to me. Come on. Tell your story walking. Hey, wait a minute. Don't... Oh, for God's sakes... - Thanks for your help back at the train. - Wait a minute. Oh, for Jesus... Air One to ground, I think we lost them. They're somewhere beneath the overpass. Well, you certainly carjacked a really nice car. This is a piece of shit. What are you talking about? I need sugar, you know. I'm-I'm getting cranky. Getting? I'm hypoglycaemic. Uh, my body can't metabolize the sugar, so... So you're a real, you know, pain in the ass when you don't eat. Basically. Yeah. Right. - We should eat then. - Let's do that. His real name is Edward Lyle. Graduated from Drexel University. Enlisted in the army, 1953. Rapid promotion, excelled at intelligence and communications. Joined NSA in '65. Of course. Yeah. He was in the agency till 1980, when he vanished and went underground. - Hasn't been seen since. - That's a long time. Lots of black bags, lots of deleteds. He's familiar with explosives, obviously. His last assignment, he went into Iran, late '78, after the Shah. - This is our problem. - This man. So, we were helping the secret police supply weapons... to the Afghani rebels fighting the Soviets. My partner and I were on the eastern border monitoring Soviet military transmissions. It was kind of fun, actually. I liked the Iranians. But back in Tehran, the hard-liners seized the embassy... and overnight, the whole country changed. People we'd been working with, they turned on us. I got out. My partner didn't. By the time I got home, the whole mission had become a press disaster waiting to happen. Aiding and abetting the new enemy. The agency conveniently forgot I existed. I don't blame them. It's what they had to do. I loved the agency. I loved the work. I loved the people. It was my whole life. Your partner was Rachel's father. Yeah. The idea was... The idea always was that if one of us got out, he'd take care of the other's family. Rachel was all he had, so she became my promise to him. - Here you go, hon. - Thank you. Maybe we can still keep that promise in a way. You're a threat now, just like I was. Threat to whom? To them? To your family, to your friends, everyone you know, everyone you meet. That's why I went away and didn't come back. You gotta go away, Robert. No, I don't think so. This is my life. I worked hard for it, and I want it back. I grew up without a father. I know what that is. And I will not allow my family to go through that. Mommy, I don't wanna go home. Wanna take a poke at me? Come on. I don't hit senior citizens. Oh, come here, Babe. Come on. Hey. Come up here. Come on. You know, in guerilla warfare, you try to use your weaknesses as strengths. - Such as? - Well... if they're big and you're small, then you're mobile and they're slow. You're hidden and they're exposed. You only fight battles you know you can win. That's the way the Vietcong did it. You capture the weapons and you use them against them the next time. That way they're supplying you. You grow stronger as they grow weaker. - Hey, try these. - Can I have something else, please? - Yeah. Here. - N-Never mind. - That's my best aloha shirt. - Well, say "aloha" to it. - Steve, how you doing? - Howdy. - Need some gear. - Help yourself. - Say hi to Bill. - Hi, Bill. - How you doing, Bill? Steve, where's the two gigahertz video transmitters? Right behind you, second shelf. Steve? I thought you said his name was Bill. No. You're Bill. If I'm Bill, you're going to have to let me know I'm Bill. I just did. The, uh, president has not committed himself... but he does recognize that we do need something in this area. And I think he will come to see that this bill will, in the end... provide the kind of security that this... - What security? - The kind of security he's gonna need. Ah, here we go. Modified cell phone interfaced with laptop computer. - Creates an enormously powerful tool. - What is that? This is Congressman Albert's home address and his cellular ESN. Now, we reprogramme our phone... with Congressman Albert's ESN, and you know what we got? Hi, sweetie. We just landed. So, how are the kids? - Melissa has a fever. - She okay? - She's fine. - When will you have some time to talk? - Uh, about 30, 40 minutes. I'll be in suite 59, Lincoln Hotel. I'll call you when you get in. You're a dangerous man. Oh, shit. Aw, shit. - Say something. - Excuse me? - Louder. - What are you talking about? - That's good. - Won't they look in there? - That's the idea. Great plan. I've been a law-abiding citizen my whole life. One day with you... I'm sh-shooting... and breaking... I have to go to the bathroom. - Rest well. - Thanks. Bye. Good work, guys. We got him. Yeah, go for it, Mr Congressman. I think you're too young to watch this part here. Yeah, so is she. Yeah, hello. Could you send somebody up to my room, please? Yes, this is Christa, the congressman's aide. Might be able to piggyback it on top of this. How the hell am I supposed to know what it is? I'm just a congressman, for Christ's sake. Security expert tells me it's like a-a PX-73 burst transmitter, whatever the hell that is... except it's-it's much, much more sophisticated. Of course I'm going to send it down, but that's... That's not the... Because I want to know who in the hell put it there, Jim. - Hi there. Hey. - Hola. Si? The category, Barbara. You know, this is very irritating. Get one channel and stay with it. - Stop jumping... - We're on TV- - I told you to stop jumping around. - We're on TV- Okay, these are the ones they wanted us to find. They're all ours. We made 'em. Thomas, could I see you a second? Look, there's $140,000 here. I have no idea where it came from. - What are you talking about? An extra 140? - Yeah. Look, it's right here. Two separate $70,000 deposits on the same day. Yes, I see the deposits, thank you. What I'm saying is I have no idea where they came from. Tom. I'm sorry. That was Shaffer. He wants to see all department heads at 0800. You're going in on Sunday. - That's just great. - Emily. This is your separate account. I have no idea... By the way, who is Christa? "Eternally yours"? I want the entire history of this device, from birth to abortion, on my desk in two hours. I want the name of the tech who made it. I want to know who authorized its use... who checked it out from inventory... and for what purpose. Most important, how on God's green earth... it got into Congressman Albert's hotel room. Listen, people, everyone here knows where this is going. Now, if this was a legit op... If this was a legit op... and I can't possibly see how it could be, then so be it. But if this was somebody's unilateral wet dream... then that somebody is going to prison. It's him. - Yes? - Thomas Reynolds? Who is this? I have that environmental study you've been looking for. Can we discuss this in person? Be at the corner of Iowa and Third at 3:00. I'll be there at 4:00. We have to get a confession out of this guy, we have to... get it on tape, and we have to get it fast, okay? Oh, you shouldn't have. This thing must've cost 12, 13 bucks easy. Now, they expect me to be wired, all right? So what they'll do is they'll sweep me. But once they're done, I'm gonna give you the signal... - and, uh, you turn the mike on. - What's the signal? Signal is putting, uh, gum in my mouth. So after the signal, you turn the mike on. T-Turn it on now. - Let's try it. - Okay, off. Off. Good. Now, to be safe, they'll also try... to scan all the frequencies to try to track you down. Now, if these guys are good, and they're probably very good, in a location like this... they'll have you in five, six minutes. So let's say in four minutes time, after you turn that tape on... regardless of what's happening, you get out that door. - Now, you got that? - No. Record. On-off. All right, let the games begin. Hey there. Edward Lyle. Policeman. - Very clever. - Why don't you call your friends over. Pratt. Step towards the fence for me. This won't take a second. He's clear, sir. So, do you have the tape? - Yes, I have. - Here? - No. - Then what is there to talk about? Money. - Money? I was wondering why I hadn't seen it on CNN. Have you looked at the tape? - What's on it? - Your ugly-ass face is on it. It shows the death of Congressman Hamersly. The needle behind the ear. - Three faces, readily identifiable. - How much you want for it? - 1.8 million dollars. - What? And my file cleared. I want my life back. My 1980 salary with cost-of-living increases for the past 18 years. Plus interest. - Oh, shit. Plus the retirement package for executive level E-16. Comes to 1.85. I rounded it down. And for this, I get the tape and, uh, Mr Dean. - Actually, it's Dean that has the tape. - Aw, shit. - So what does he want? - He wants to know why you killed the girl. What girl you talking about? I tried to explain it to him, but I couldn't figure it out myself. You're getting self-righteous on me? Because I've seen your file. - Not exactly a beacon of light. - Yeah, I agree. It's just that... You kill Hamersly, okay. I wouldn't have, but I understand the argument. But why the girl? Just to get to some schmuck who barely knows you're after him? Schmuck? We never had to deal with domestic. With us, it was always war. You won the war. Now we're fighting the peace. It's a lot more volatile. Does he take this long doing everything? Now we've got ten million crackpots out there with sniper scopes, saran gas and C-4. Ten-year-olds go on the Net, downloading encryption we can barely break, not to mention... Aw, shit. Instructions on how to make a low-yield nuclear device. Privacy's been dead for 30 years because we can't risk it. The only privacy that's left is the inside of your head, and maybe that's enough. - Come on. Get him to say something. - We've located subject. Keep him talking. You think we're the enemy of democracy, you and I? I think we're democracy's last hope. There's always going to be power. You shouldn't be there, Robert, but if you are, get out. They're onto us. Get out and follow procedure. Get out now, Robert. Get out- You gonna shoot a policeman on the street? You wouldn't get a block. Get in. - Yeah? - Tom? - Emily, what is it? Tom, our Visa card's been cancelled. I tried to use... Did you try the American Express? Yeah, I tried that, too, and it's not... Look, I-I-I can't deal with this right now. - I'll call you back. - Tom, listen, I... No, Tom... Credit cards not working, huh? Yeah, that can be a real pain in the ass, can't it? Come in. - Asshole. - Great plan. Tell him to give me the tape. - What guarantees do we have if... - None. None? Does everybody here know that you killed Phil Hamersly and Rachel Banks? This guy is going down, and he's going to take all of you with him. Trust me on this. Amah-Goddam- Oh, you son of a bitch-You... Rachel Banks is not the issue. Oh, you bastard... Hamersly is the issue. He was killed for a purpose. Now, where's the tape? Oh... Oh, shit. Where's the tape? - Tom- - All right. All right. - I'll-I'll give it to you. - Thank you. What are you doing, you moron? That's our only leverage- - For Christ's sake. - I'm the moron? Me? No, you're the moron- - Where is it? - Washington and Fourth. - Washington and Fourth. - That's my blender. - So? Fourth and Washington. - Where is it? - The restaurant. 11169 Fourth Street. Stand by to enter. Wait a second. See if you can get the plate on that van. T-S-1-8-7-8-5. - You go in with Pratt and bring it out. - I don't think so. Oh, you don't think so? If I go in there and I bring that tape out... I'm a dead man. We go together, you and me. And you view the tape, you sign off on it. They let Brill go, and you take the tape home. Everyone has a Merry Christmas. What assurances do I have that you haven't copied that tape? You think I want copies? That tape has been the bane of my existence. I wish the one that we have was at the bottom of the Chesapeake. I wanna go home. - Give me a piece. - Yes, sir. All right, you and me. And Pratt and Bingham. Fiedler, get one of those little cameras on Bingham. Guess what. It's a government vehicle. Shit- I'm going in cold. If I need you, Hicks will call it. You guys got some food or something in here? Oh, behind you. You're either incredibly smart or incredibly stupid. We'll see in a minute. Watch out for the FBI. - I'll be back to get my blender. - Yeah, I'll have it gift-wrapped. It's your show. Isn't that the guy that was here last time? That labour lawyer? You're right. - No, no. Thank you. - You guys like the food? - Yeah. It's good food. - It's good food, huh? I made it. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, sure you made it. - Come on. Eat your food. - I'm eating. Boss. - Huh? - Black guy's back with a couple creeps. Yeah, sh-show him in. Hey, how you doing? What's this, the FBI? No, sir, Mr Pintero. This is the gentleman you wanted to meet. - Oh, that's him? - Yep, that's him. - So you made the tape? - What? Did you make the videotape? Look, look. He wants it back. Really? I don't give a shit what he wants. Could we have some privacy, please? Yeah, maybe we should. - Maria, get the kids out of here. - Come on, boys. Get 'em out of here. Go on. Maria, come on-Get 'em out-Come on-Uncle Paulie will take you to the zoo later. - Ooh, ooh, Hicks. - What the hell's the matter with him? No, no, no, no. Not on the equipment. We gotta get him... Okay. Check this out. Come here. Tony, they just pulled a guy out of the van. He's puking and bleeding all over himself. Shit. It's a city cop. Hey, Babe. Come on. Come on. Oh, yeah. Okay. Now, he's your friend. You persuade him to give us the tape. Hey, look. Number one, he's not my friend. - And number two, it's not his tape. - Whose is it? It's mine, okay? It's mine. I bought it. You sold it to him? Now, you listen to me. Who are you? What the fuck you trying to do to me? Oh, this looks bad. - I'm with the federal government. Oh, the federal government made a videotape? - You guys oughta get in there. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Listen. Now, we can go get a warrant and come back with the FBI, take anything we want... arrest anybody that we want... Just give the man the videotape. Hey, only one gonna get arrested here is you, for felonious cocksucking... with an attempt to swallow the evidence, so shut your mouth. And you, get the fuck out of here. Go get your warrant. And until then, get out of my joint. Come on. You gotta get in there-God, there are gonna be dead bodies all over the... - Shut up- - Get in there-Get in there-Come on. Shit, forget it. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Okay. This is it-, This is it-Krug, take the rear. Jamie, you're with us. Jones, you're on the side entrance. - So what are we waiting for? Come on. Let's go... No. Tony says we wait until they show up. We wait. - Put the guns away. - You put your guns away. Put it away. Put it away. Put it away. Put it away. All right, I'm putting it away. Now, what will it take for us to get that videotape? The end of the world. Let's go. We're leaving. - Put the guns down now. - Everybody, drop your weapons... No- Go-Go-Go- Out of the way-Out of the way- - Get your hands up. - You get your hands up-Drop the gun- On your knees. Easy-Easy-Easy with this guy. He's not one of them. Easy, easy. Get up. Get up. Get up. Come on. All right. Let's get this place cleaned up. Not too stupid after all. Let's go. Let's move it. Come on. Right there. Somebody get the paramedics. We need some paramedics in here. We have 13 bodies in here. Let's go. All right, listen up. Get some IDs on these guys. Let's get these guns out of here. This guy is going down. He's going to take all of you with him. - Goddam- - Rachel Banks is not the issue. Hamersly is the issue. He was killed for a purpose. Now, where's the tape? - Why did you record it? - Okay, uh... first of all, we were there for technical support. And, uh, we had no idea... - Do they know that Reynolds is dead? - Yeah. - They know all that? - Right, but they're still stalling. - They're still stalling. - A tape. - A tape of it. - What did you think was going on? - Oh, I thought it was an STO. - STO? - Standard Training Op. Congressman-Rhonda Overby, CNN. Does this mean the privacy bill is dead, Congressman? Uh, in its current form, yes, but the issue is still very much alive, I can assure you... unless, of course, no one worries about national security any more. We knew that we had to monitor our enemies. We also have come to realize that we need... to monitor the people who are monitoring them. Well, who's going to monitor the monitors of the monitors? I wouldn't mind doing a little, uh, monitoring myself. Mmm. Yeah, and you got lots and lots of monitoring to do. Are you guys talking about sex? - Boy... - Oh, no. It's time for dinner. Get in there and eat your dinner. No more hanging with Dylan. Brill, you are one sick man. Yeah, me too. Ooh, you're gonna need to get a tan on those things. Congressman Sam Albert, how do we draw the line... draw the line... between protection of national security... obviously the government's need to obtain intelligence data... and the protection of civil liberties, particularly the sanctity of my home? You've got no right to come into my home.
