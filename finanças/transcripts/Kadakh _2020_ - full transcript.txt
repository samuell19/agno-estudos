I fired him last week He came in today, said he was depressed, I thought he just wanted to talk.. But he had a gun.. he just.. - Sunil you are not lying to me, are you? - Malti, please.. Don't start this now, okay? Why did you fire him if he was depressed? I didn't fire him because he was depressed, he got depressed because I fired him. Why did he come into the bedroom? I got him into the bedroom, later.. Come here, I'll show you See this. It happenned right here I was sitting over here. At first I thought.. We have to call the police Don't be mad- we can't call the police. I am involved There is a dead man in our house, we haven't done anything! They will never understand that. He is in our house. And he is dead. So what do you want to do? Nothing? Let me think.. maybe we can call somebody. Somebody who can help us. They are here Send them away.. tell them its cancelled. I can't breathe..

Help me with this. You are looking very nice Takes a lot of hard work, okay? - Shall I keep it in the freezer? - Not the freezer Happy Diwali, Mister master chef Why such a sad happy diwali? - He wants to cancel the party - Are you mad? I have got 5 kilo of mutton. So many goats have given up their lives, and you want to cancel the plan! Just one goat! How selfish are you! What about her partner? He must be all alone now, suffering ..and their 18 kids who are now orphaned! And his parents, his siblings? Give them a thought! How much you talk, Joshi.. If you really pity them, turn vegetarian What's with you? Do you have fever? Stomach ache? - Throat? - Are you a doctor? - He is fine! - He's shivering.. it could be malaria Malaria is not contagious Lets do it another time, maybe this Sunday. You can't cancel it right now Today is Diwali- not Sunday All morning he was asking me what time I'd reach. Can't cancel.. I have invited a very special guest - Who is your guest? - Will tell you. These online apps have solved all my intimacy issues What are you on? mixer, blender, grinder, I'm on all of them What is with Joshi? Cackling all the time Does it look like he has just come out of a broken marriage? - Stop judging people.. - I will, I'm sorry- he is just so shallow Alka, you know somebody in the police, right? Yes, what happened? There's been an accident on the highway - You had an accident? - No, a colleague at work. It wasn't his fault really.. Nobody admits their mistakes If somebody just jumps in front of your car? - Listen is this blouse very tight? - Let me check.. - How bad was it? - Don't know.. He didn't stop So now, should one report it to the police? Are you mad? No way.. This is a hit and run case. If the man is badly injured, then this guy will be going to the cops for the next 15 years.. and if he died.. then your friend is done in! That's what I thought - But this is not right. - Right for who? You don't go out looking for trouble! What would you have done? I would have done something.. That is what we all think- I'd have done something. But when the moment arrives, your brain shuts down - You're such a cynic.. - I am a realist! So tell me.. Whatever is on your mind.. - I fucked up big time.. - I know that. What happened? An affair You are such an idiot. Why would you do that? Everything is going well for you. Who is it? - Somebody.. - Call if off, right away - Its done - Not a word about it now. Whatever you do- just don't tell anyone. Especially me Don't sulk now. What is the worst that could happen- divorce.. Its okay. That is the worst, right? The only problem is, where would we go for the party next year- yours or Malti's Ah, the goddesses descend on this earth Joshi, don't sing.. how is the mutton doing? Takes time to marienate it Go take a shower- you'll feel better How is it that I love you more everyday, butterfly? Aww so cute.. Look at you two There is no romance left in my life!! Nobody calls me butterfly.. What is this butterfly nonsense? This is his new word for me, for the past 3 months I guess they're getting romantic in their old age.. Yeah, we try.. Am I the only one drinking at this party? You guys go, party. Don't mind me. I'll slave on.. How much you complain, Joshi! Dhruva, get me one more beer Submitting my son to child labour!

That's a friend - Cheers to Rahul.. - He knows what I need Rahul it takes a lot of courage to give up a good job Why, most writers have a day job Even I have an announcement to make. My name is not Joshi anymore- it is Sagar - But your name has always been Sagar - But you all call me Joshi Stop it Joshi! What happened? Dhruva got burnt Every Diwali there's an accident How did it happen? - I didn't do anything, it was an accident. - You have to be more careful I told you to go down and play - Its okay, he'll be fine - What do you mean its okay? He's getting a blister - Malti do you have an ointment - Yes getting it. He's such a brave boy- not even crying - Let him cry if he wants to! - But mama, I don't feel like crying.. But you have to! Cry, whether or not you feel like it Really, it takes a village to raise a child.. Earlier we used to live in joint families.. What are you trying to say? That I'm not capable? I'm not saying that.. But you are implying that single mothers are not good enough I raised him up myself- there was no bloody village - Paro, your courage is admirable - What does it have to do with courage? Its a matter of choice I don't need to prove to anybody that I'm a good mother Exactly! You are a good mother - I have made mutton for you all.. - Joshi, there is a time to joke.. - Vivan just say sorry to Dhruva - But I didn't.. And no more fireworks now. Why is she over reacting? Okay fine, Joshi- say sorry to Paro - For what? - Just say sorry And don't treat me like a victim. You are a brilliant mother, Paro I didn't plan on being a single mom, okay? It just happened, I'm trying to do the best I can Come Joshi, lets check on the mutton - He didn't mean it.. - Paro, seriously sorry - Does everything have to be a joke? - Let it go, Paro..

Besides, I don't trust any of you - Not even me? - Except Alka. Give him the news Breaking news- Rahul's book is being published After four years of struggle! He was busy writing, WE were the ones struggling Come on Sheetal, give the poor guy a break Listen, I love him but the truth is that we were struggling Come on Sheetal, lay off the poor man for once - No no, this man is a hero. - There he goes again. He is the only one who asked the universe correctly. Sir, the universe is like your cook Really.. This is a fact! Every morning the cook asks you, 'Sir what shall I serve you today?' And what do you say? 'Anything..' That is why you are served veggies! You have to be specific boss! You have to say, 'No, I want mutton curry. Boneless. With some onions dipped in vinegar.. And for dessert- some kulfi.. And you shall receive - Sunil - That's all it takes? just ask? You have to go shop for the ingredients I must tell you, the cook took a long time getting the right order The cook has many other orders to look into.. Come on, show some money. My husband doesn't give free advice What are we going to do with him Sunil? I don't know. We'll see tomorrow - Yeah but where? - I can't think straight right now. We'll leave him on the terrace Can't do that. They put a lock on the terrace What? Since when? It was decided in the last society meeting This housing society is the pits Why would they ruin it for everybody? The terrace is for everybody. - We'll leave this house - Tomorrow morning? No- but we won't renew the lease next time This house is inauspicious You know we've been going for couples counselling These counsellors don't know a thing We used to start fighting in his office Once we were so loud, another couple ran away from the waiting room The counsellor said, 'please leave. I can't manage you guys' Really. He said, 'your wife knows everything' Yeah right, blame it on her - It takes two to navigate, Joshi - Call me Sagar! What is this name change business? Sagar doesn't sound like you Sounds like a cheap food joint And why would you change your name? Why not? If you can change the names of cities, why can't a man change his name? And then Sagar IS my name I am not saying call me Arnold Shwarzeneggar What has changed? I still call VT by its old name.. Shh.. Have you reached? Do you see a.. coconut tree? Stay there, I'm coming- don't helter skelter How will you manage French, Joshi? - Alka, keep stirring it - You'll get burnt.. Unbelievable, you really are my hero. Through all the hurt and humiliation, you ploughed through. - That's conviction. That is success. - Thank you You never gave up. You never reacted to the fact- my wife doesn't believe in me. Are my friends laughing? Is my book even good. Am I even a writer? No! You stuck with it boss That is conviction.. Cheers Who is the publisher? Its a new company.. moonfool publications And.. how many copies? In the first run- 3000 3000? That is all? It's a start 3000 is too little What is done is done- just 3000? It's a start, Yogesh! Too late, too little. I told you, Rahul- you must have a vision board. You look into the mirror every morning and say, 'Boss I want success' You want a Bentley, you imagine yourself driving that Bentley. - You must smell the leather - I dont want a Bentley, ok? No, whatever car you like, that's not the point You are scared of your own success - You are scared of it - Okay But never mind, in this loss also there is an opportunity This is a loss? This is the happiest day of my life This is a loss? 3000 is too little.. I have an idea.. Hear me out.. Focus How much does each copy cost? About 300.. Okay, arrange 900,000 rupees from somewhere. When the book releases.. .. that month, quietly buy out all the copies - Are you mad? - Everybody is doing it Rahul If I buy out all the copies, who will read it then? That is the game Rahul- Its a sureshot success The publishing house will be zapped. And the public will be like, 'oh he is successful... we want to be part of that' No, thanks.. My book will sell on its own merit Merit? Where will 3000 reach on merit? It's cool. Somebody will read it- if not now, then after I die.. See, if somebody has to be found, he'll be found To be found? How sweet! Are you oil? If you are not oil, sir- nobody is looking for you! You must find yourself! For 900,000 you will find yourself! - You'll become a millionaire - No thank you, let me just do it my way Okay done. No problem. But I am happy for you. Cheers.. So what is the story? You read the book Tell me a little.. Please, Rahul.. Well its our story.. What do you mean its our story? Its your story. How is it ours? Yeah.. but it is the story of all of us We are all a part of your book? - I'm also in the book? - Yes - I'm in the book? - Yes What's my name? Anand. Anand.. nice. So what does Anand do? Anand is a motivational speaker.. and a part time priest Part time priest.. nice So what happens to Anand? - Should I tell you? - Yes please, this is exciting Well, about two thirds into the film.. No, book! No, this is good! See, subconcious wants it. Now you're projecting Rahul- film, TV series, success.. It's a book So about two thirds into the book.. Anand kills himself Because he realises that.. behind all the facade, the empty words, there is nothing.. Its just emptiness.. There's no real person there, you see.. This is a really fucked up idea.. Read the book first.. don't judge it yet Really I'm quite amazed at you Rahul.. For 4 years, there is a myth about Rahul writing a book, behind closed doors... and you go and write about your friends? Its not about.. A man can only write about what he knows- and I know you guys There is a thing called imagination. Murakami isn't writing about his day. Rumi never said, I woke up and had breakfast- Toast was burnt, what is this shit? - Have you read Murakami? - Why should I read it? One doesn't become Murakami merely by reading Murakami - This is ridiculous.. - Why are you arguing about this? I have built an empire. You are saying I'm committing suicide. I'm depressed When have I looked depressed to you? I'm super happy Its not YOU! Fine, you should remove me from the book - Remove you from the book? - I could sue you Its going to be published in three weeks.. I could completely sue you. I'll sue you I'll sue you, I'll sue you. Boss what are you talking about? I'm not dying. I can't die. I'll sue you Yogesh have you lost it? OR, I'll sue you Rahul I've got a great idea. Just watch this.. I'll sue you. Your book will be in trouble. If you are lucky it might even get banned - Then people will really want to read it - Yogesh I don't want your help! - It's brilliant - I don't want your help You're scared of your success Rahul - You're scared of your own potential - I'll ask you if I need your help.. Enough! - This is not your house? - No, its a friend's house - But that's not okay? - No no it's okay No.. I feel.. comment dire.. awkward No need to be awkward. They are like my family - See this? - Very beautiful This is Rangoli Today is Diwali. So doors are kept open for Goddess Lakshmi.. Charming.. Shoes! You like my shoes? Very nice.. France? Everybody, here is my friend, Francoise Marie Hello! Happy Diwali.. This is Malti, that is Sunil- Its their house actually Well done Joshi - Here's some wine - She is so sweet - Thank you for inviting me - Of course, anytime She has come with her shoes on.. Shoes.. Sorry, what about my shoes? You have to take them off I didn't tell you- in Indian homes you have to take off your shoes. You can sit and do it Don't worry- she'll manage.. She seems uneducated - It's okay.. - Her heels are so long She'll manage Go and put on your shoes I got it on camera Shit! - The party just started - Everything happens for a reason This was your favourite Vietnamese vase, right? Sunil, go get a mop! - I am really sorry guys - It's okay.. Malti I'll get you a new one.. Maybe it's better I get out of here.. Get some flour.. - Hi I am Alka - Alka, Francoise Marie Yogesh Calm down! It was just an accident. So.. Calm down Alka! I will put it back together I don't want a broken vase Nothing is broken.. Or else, everything is broken- Perspective! Everything happens for a reason After I put it back together, it'll be better than before. Paro, its broken! I am so sorry, are you going to drink something? I'd like a glass of red wine - I'll get it - Joshi sit down. Baby get her a glass of red wine and get me a beer please No drinks for you, you've had too many. Guys relax! No one died, it's a party Are you switching on the air conditioning? There is a stench- can't you smell it? The whole city is stinking- either its garbage or piss Why do you have to be disgusting? Its just a word- why is the word disagreeable? - It sounds so down market, cheap. - It's just a word Sir, words also need branding You guys are illiterate. This is how they say it in Persian. Persian used to be the language of highly educated people He is a great great author, our friend His book is getting published Please don't let it get to his head. Can you just let him enjoy his moment for once - Listen it's not yet been published - It will, very soon.. - She is saying, congratulations. - I heard her, idiot! So Francoise.. Francoise Marie Marie.. I have a question. I often notice the French people, sometimes they kiss twice, sometimes three times.. Yeah it's confusing Baby, why do you care what the French people do? Quiet.. Its such an interesting question Oh its actually very confusing In Paris we kiss two times in the South, it's three times.. and sometimes in Montpellier it is four times No- that is not what I'm asking. Why three times, what is the logic? Perhaps in the confusion we are hoping for an accident.. where the lips are meeting I love France - Joshi, stop drooling all over her - Have you ever been to France? No, never! He doesn't have a passport Sir here's your parcel What is this smell? Is it stale food? No sir, its fresh Fresh, my ass! smell it.. Its fresh sir.. Crap!

But before I go I'm going to call the police Rahul don't do that.. What are you going to tell them? I am going to tell them there has been a murder here. Is that okay? Rahul, your finger prints are on the gun- and on the trunk. - And yours - What the fuck, bro What a creep you are! What do you expect? I am asking for your help, as a friend This is asking for help? This? Can we decide what to do about this? Mama.. in Breaking Bad they use acid to dissolve the body Vivan! Acid! A man who used to laugh, love, cook- and in the end its just acid? - Joshi get a hold on your self - What does it all mean? He is dead.. - Joshi, I didn't do it.. - I know. That is what is really sad. He killed himself. Can you imagine how much pain there must be in his life? Joshi he is in a happier place now How do you know? How do you know that? What if he is still unhappy? All you smart people, you have words.. ..but no feelings I hate all of you Please Joshi. Stop making this about yourself This is no time to be emotional He is dead, we are alive. He doesn't have problems, we do. He doesn't have to go to work tomorrow, I do Quite frankly he is the most selfish man I've ever met, not you Sunil Everybody has problems- Everybody is suffering. I don't go blowing my brains out - That too on Diwali night. - And in somebody else's house Who does that, man? What about this unfortunate soul? Unfortunate? He? What about us? He escaped. We are the ones trapped He is my friend. Not you guys.. I just want to hug him.. I feel so close to him - Joshi what are you doing? - I just want to sleep.. Go inside and sleep - Joshi what are you doing? - I want to hug this guy I want to feel close to him.. I understand him Stop being ridiculous Joshi! will you stop it.. - I just want to feel close to him.. - Joshi stop it Sheetal let him be Why can't you all just stop this? What are you doing? There is a dead body here and you all are just crying and thinking about yourselves Sheetal stop being hysterical Of course I am going to be hysterical, How can you be so calm? What's wrong with YOU? Guys can we decide whats to be done? She is right.. Sunil? Malti? I want him out of the house, that is all Yeah, but where? You can't just dump a body out on the road.. Anybody has any bright ideas, speak now Vivan, no acid- no knives.. Any other ideas? Railway tracks When you have it, you don't realise its value.. but after its gone, you know what it really meant Sunil, is it okay if we skip? Are you nuts? I am not exactly mad about doing this. Either we all go, or nobody.. Get the car Sunil, will you? Don't you touch me. You are a curse - Baby promise me something - Yeah? Don't ever cheat on me I'd rather die.. - Oh shit! - What happened?
