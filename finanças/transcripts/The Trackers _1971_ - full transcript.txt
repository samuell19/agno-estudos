(horse hooves pattering) - Whoa, boy. - Sam. - Hello, Dora. I figured I better feed him now because it'll be late by the time we get home. - That's fine, I got some cloth for Becky. Now maybe we can find that knife that Davey wanted. - Good, we ever forgot that old bottle he'd skin us alive. (laughing) - Sheriff, Sheriff! (dramatic music) Sheriff! - Well, now, what's this? - Sheriff! Sheriff! - Whoa boy, whoa, whoa. (people chattering) - It's old Will Styles. He's been shot up bad. Now, they killed his misses and two hands. I was down by the creek when I heard the shots. - All right, boy, all right. Slow down, now, and let me get the straight of this. - Well, Mr. Styles can't talk too good, but he did say something about troopers. - Better let him get Styles over to see Doc Handley. Don't you think, Sheriff? - He's right, son, you get along. We'll talk later. Has to be them army deserters from Fort Winnick. I heard they robbed a bank up north and killed a woman doin' it. - Well, ain't that pretty quick figurin', Tom? - I don't think so, Sam. They were supposed to be headin' south. Well, I better get out to Style's place and see what I can pick up. Oh, uh, Sam. - Yeah? - Style's place is pretty close to yours. You better be on the lookout. - I'll do that, Tom. - Sam? - Nevermind, Dora, everything is gonna be all right. Let's just get out home. Whoa, boys. Poole, Bernie. You all right, Dora? - Fine. - Let's go home. - Just fine, I'll say. - Come on, boys. - Hey, D, where you goin'? - Oh, I'm gonna go see the horses. (thrilling music) - Davey! - Get in the house, Becky. - But, Davey. - Come on, get in the house. (rifle cocking) - Sam, will there be any trouble? - Oh, no, no! I'm just fidgety, is all. (gun blasting) Ho, boy, ho! Hold that, Dora. Now you just sit tight and I'll be right back. (suspenseful music) - [Davey] Pa. (Davey groaning) - Davey. Davey. Davey, my boy. - Pa. Troopers. (gagging) Becky. I waited for you, Pa. - Oh, Davey. - Pa? Pa? - Davey. Davey? Davey. Oh, Davey. (crying) Oh, Davey. (objects crashing) (glass breaking) (suspenseful music) (gun blasting) - Ha! (gun blasting) (grunting) (whimpering) (carriage clattering) - Davey! - He's gone, Dora, he's gone. - Oh my God, no! - I can't find Becky. I gotta get to town, Dora. Gonna get a posse. Thank you, Hank. - Sam. What'd you stop here for? - Well, I just sent for Charlie Gordon in Abilene. - There ain't no need for U.S. Marshals, Sam. I'm the law here. - Well, ain't no one denying that, Tom, but I sent for a tracker not just a lawman and Charlie Gordon's the best, you know that. - All right, Sam, we'll get your daughter back and them army deserters where they belong by the time he gets here. - Why, thank ya. (upbeat country western music) (horse hooves pattering) (water splashing) - Becky? - No, Dora. Completely lost 'em. I wanna thank all of ya. And I want you men to get some rest and we'll get some fresh horses and pack in for a long haul. - So long, Sam. - See you tomorrow, Sam. - We're never gonna find her, are we? - Now, now, now, don't even think that, Dora. - I just, I just wish to the Lord I hadn't fussed at her this morning. Ain't that somethin', Sam? I ain't fussed at her in a whole month of Sunday and this-- - Now, now, now, now, now, Dora, Dora. Don't you worry. I sent a message to Charlie Gordon. - Will he come? - Well, of course. We rode together for a long time. He'll come, now don't you worry, honey. Now Dora, I want you to move over Dilworth's while I'm gone. - No, there's no need. - I want you to. - Sam. - Huh? - You be careful. If anything happened to you. - Now, don't you worry, ain't nothin' gonna happen to me. And I'll be bringin' Becky back with me too. (soft crying) Well, where are the rest? I mean, is this all of ya? - I'm sorry, Sam, this here's all that showed up. - You know how it is, Mr. Paxton. - Sure. Sure, I understand. - Sam, this is Ben Vogel, a scout from San Antonio. - Mr. Paxton, I hope to be of help. - I appreciate you comin'. Dora, when Charlie Gordon gets here, tell him to pick us up over at the rocks. - All right. - Hey, Tom. Look. - That's Charlie Gordon, yes, sir! (laughs) I knew he wouldn't let me down! I told ya, I told ya! Good old Charlie! (slow tempo country music) That ain't no Charlie Gordon. - There sure ain't nobody like that around these parts. - Who are you? - Ezekiel Smith, Deputy U.S. Marshal. - Who'd you say? - Ezekiel Smith, Deputy United States Marshal. And I'm looking for Sam Paxton. - You're lookin' at him. - I'm from Abilene. - Well, where's Charlie Gordon? - He ain't comin'. He sent me instead. - Nobody told you to get off that horse, Mister. Now, let me get this straight. You say Charlie Gordon can't come and he sent you instead? - That's right, all the way from Abilene. - I never would have believed it. He was one of the best officers in the Confederate Army. Sendin' me a... I sure thought different of him. - He also sent you this, Mr. Paxton. (gentle country music) - [Charlie] Sam, the man giving you this here letter is one Ezekiel Smith. He's the best damn tracker and law man I ever met excepting me. Pay no mind to his manner. I could never work without him. I would have come myself in this here your hour of need, excepting I'm ailing bad and find I cannot. Your friend, Charles W. Gordon, United States Marshal. (paper crumpling) - What's wrong with him? - Gut wound. Shot bringing in Billy Williams. - Nobody told you to get off your horse, Mister! - Well, I just thought. - I don't care what you thought! Now, you get off my property before I blow you to where you belong! - I guess the marshal made a mistake, Mr. Paxton. He figured you just wanted to get your girl back. - Mr. Smith! - Dora! - Ma'am. - Wait a minute. Sam. Sam. Sam, I don't care what this man is. All I know is that Becky is out there somewhere and Charlie Gordon sent this man to help find her. I want my baby back, Sam. I want Becky back. (dramatic music) - Let's start trackin', Mr. Smith. (horse whinnying) - Sam, he ain't gonna find nothin'. We already know them army deserters did it. We're just wastin' time. - Dora wants it, Tom. - It's useless, Sam, and you know it. - Dora wants it, it's her right. - It's mine, where'd you find it? - Up the hill, Mrs. Paxton. Now I know this might sound like a kind of a strange question but what makes you so sure it was troopers that-- - Well now, that's a right smart question, ain't it, boys? (laughing) Because Sam's boy said it was troopers. - Did they take anything, Ma'am? - Our Becky, and your fiddly fool questions are keeping us from finding her! - Mr. Smith, they took everyone of our horses and all the food we had. - Did they take anything from inside? I mean like jewelry, money, guns, or maybe dresses even? - No. No, they didn't take any money. I don't have any jewelry to speak of except my brooch. But this music box was missing. - Did you see anything, Mr. Paxton? - A trooper and my son bleedin' to death. - Mr. Paxton, it was Indians that stole your girl. - Indians? On shod ponies? Ha! - Comanches or Apaches. If they're Comanches, they'll be headin' straight for the desert. If they're Apaches, they'll be headin straight for Mexico to trade them horses they stole from you and maybe your girl too. - There ain't been no Indians around here for more than two years. - You ever heard of a white man stealing all that food and all them horses? And leaving money behind? And taking a lady's powder box that they couldn't even open? - Don't make no difference who it was. We aim to catch 'em, that's all. Come on, boys. (dramatic music) - Well, it's too soon to rest. - He's your man. (horse neighing) - What now? - Well, I'm trying to figure out where those that took them horses of yours gonna meet up with those who took your daughter. If I was an Indian-- - And you ain't far from it. - Here's where I'd head for. - Rock Bluff, why? - Well, if I was an Indian, which I ain't, I'd rather be lookin' down on them that's comin' then lookin' up. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) Now we know how they got them shod horses and that uniform you saw. - That happened less than a week ago. - How many you figured it was? - Seven or eight, no more than that. - Well, they sure got plenty to trade for now. - Well, with all that time passed you reckon he could still track 'em from here? - Maybe. - Not from here, Mr. Paxton. From Rock Bluff, just where we're headin'. We still got quite a ways to go to the border. - All right, Rock Bluff. - Sam. You're not gonna let that little Black Indian lead us, are ya? - There's only one man leadin' this posse, Naylor, and that's me! (horse hooves pattering) (birds chirping) Do you see anything up there, Clem? - [Clem] Not a thing, Sam. - Hey. (horse neighing) What's that? - Here's something, Mr. Paxton! Could be tore from a dress! - That's Becky's, her mother made her that dress! They passed this way for sure! - Yeah, and right through here. - Sure is a lucky thing Vogel found that piece of cloth, ain't it? - Yeah. I'm sure it is. - Them tracks, I'd sure like to know how far ahead they are. - Ho, boy. Mr. Paxton? - What now? - We're losing one or two of them Indians every mile or so. - Are you sure? - I think we better be findin' out why. - We're losin' time sittin' here talkin'! - I figure they'll be waitin' for us in there, somewhere. - Well, there can't be more than a few of 'em. We can handle it easy. - Yeah, no sense in takin' chances. Vogel, go up and ride point. - Wait a minute, Sam. What about the black? Why risk one of us, let him do it. Won't be any loss if he caught one. - Tom, get your man up there. - All right, Ben. (suspenseful music) (rifle blasting) - Head to cover, ha, ha! (rifles blasting) (groaning) (guns blasting) Hold it, hold it! - You think they're gettin' ready to rush us? - They don't need to, we're boxed in. They can keep us here as long as they want now. - Why would they wanna do that? - Well, maybe they're expecting some more to join 'em. Or they could be protecting them that's leavin'. - What do you mean by that? - I'll let you know in a minute, Mr. Paxton. You take this. (thrilling music) Mr. Paxton, come a runnin'! - Let me see those glasses. (gentle guitar music) Becky. They'll make it into Mexico all right. We'll never catch 'em. - You ain't givin' up, are you, Mr. Paxton? - You know I'm not. They can't keep us boxed up in here forever. (crickets chirping) - They oughta be miles away by now. Let's see if we can find the horses. We might have a better chance of gettin' away in the dark. - An Apache can see better in the dark than a mountain lion. - What are we gonna do, just sit here? - Nope. It don't seem right that a law man sits and lets some killers get away. - What are you gonna do? - I don't rightly know, Mr. Paxton, but I'll think of somethin'. - What do you think, Sam? - I think he'll have a hell of a hard time seein' 'em. - We can leave now, Mr. Paxton. - What? What about the Indians? - Well, like I said, we can leave now. - Where to? Sam we can't follow them halfway across Mexico. - Well, I can, come on boys, let's get goin'. - Sam, Sam, you're askin' too much. - What? - Sam, what more can we do? Clem and Vogel are dead. Not enough of us left to even have a chance. I'm goin' back. - As I recollect, there's an army unit that's stationed a little bit west of here in a town called Tulca. Right on the border. I happen to know the captain in charge. It might be a bit of a hard walk, but we can make it by noon. - Tom, Pete? - I'm sorry, Sam. (somber music) (rifle cocking) - All this your night's work? - Uh huh. Howdy, Captain. - Hello, Marshal Smith. It's good to see ya again. - Nice to see ya. This here is Sam Paxton. He needs some help in bringin' back his daughter. - His daughter? - She was took by Indians. We was pinned in a canyon east of here while they crossed a river into Mexico. We need your help, bad. - I'm sorry, Mr. Paxton, that's gonna be difficult. - Why? - She's across the river, there's nothing we can do. - What do you mean there's nothing you can? She's a white woman! What are you gonna do, just sit around here while they get away? - Mr. Paxton, I have no choice. If we cross the river into Mexico, for whatever reason, it could be considered an act of war. - Well, you know what you can do with your act of war, Mister! - Thanks, Captain. (water splashing) - I need a drink. - So do I. (men chattering) - Whiskey. - For you? - For both of us. - We don't serve them in here. - Hey. You see this, he's a U.S. Marshal. - I don't care what he is, we don't serve them here. Now, you want a drink or not? - I'm too old to change. Well, it ain't the best looking piece of horse flesh I've ever seen, but it's your choice. Here, this oughta cover for losing your other horse. Here you go. - No, thanks! - Well, what's the matter? I owe it to ya. - No, you don't! - What? - I reckon I'm about all you got now, Mr. Paxton. Now either you can go after 'em yourself or I could go along wit ya. But I ain't got no obligation to go into Mexico. - No, you ain't. - And if I went in I sure couldn't go in as a law man. - No, you couldn't. - I didn't take your money so I ain't your slave. And I sure ain't your friend. Now why don't you just tell me, what am I, huh? - Nothin' like I ever saw before. (laughs) - Well, whatever I am, you gonna have to ask me 'cause Marshal Gordon's authority over me ends right here and now. You gon ask me? - Over your dead body. - What about your daughter's body? (fist smashing) (dramatic music) That's one for you, Mr. Paxton. - Well, where ya goin'? - Well, not to the saloon, that's for sure. - Hoo. Hoo. Hoo. Hoo. Hey. I see you in there! Are you asleep? Come on, you're not sleepin'! Listen to me! I'm askin', you hear me? I'm askin'. You Black little Indian, come on, do you hear me? - You know somethin', you got a bad mouth, Mr. Paxton. Any body ever tell you that? - Never more than once. - Do you know what? Imma overlook it this time 'cause I realize that you're a mite upset. - Upset huh? Well, let me tell you somethin', just as soon as this is over I'm gonna beat the livin' sass outta you. - I'll be lookin' forward to it. (sighs) (horse neighing) Well, they sure look peaceful enough. - Uh huh. - Well. Imma go down there and get us something to eat. Now if it wouldn't hurt you none to cover me. - Hey, tracker. - Yeah? - It could be a trap. If any one of those bucks starts drifting away, watch yourself. - Yeah, I'll do that. (fire crackling) (Indian shouts) (fist smashing) (foot smashing) (gun blasting) (body thudding) (groaning) (Indian shouting) (gun blasting) (fist smashing) (men grunting) How can you eat with all these dead bodies around, huh? Sittin' there, staring at that Indian like some pale faced goblin! What's the matter with you, huh? - Today would have been my son's 17th birthday. - Let him be. - You know somethin', Charlie Gordon was right about you. You do have a peculiar way about you, but then you didn't have your boy killed nor your girl stole and Lord knows what else done to them by them savages. Yes, sir. What cause have you got to hate 'em? What do you know about it all? - I'll tell you what I know, Mr. Paxton. White men raped and killed my mother, burned down our house, shot my father. That was those cowboys, just funning. I know all about murder and killin'. You just ask me, Mr. Paxton, you just ask me. - If that's true, then why in God's green earth are you helpin' me? - Because I owe a white man. Your friend and mine, Charlie Gordon. He took me in and he raised me. He made me his deputy. He taught me everything I know. - That ain't cause enough for you to be doin' this. - You know that gut wound that Charlie Gordon took? - So? - It was meant for me! And if he hadn't stepped in and took it for me, he'd be standing here now instead of me. So I'm taking his place, Mr. Paxton, just like he took mine and for no other reason. - [Sam] Well, what now? - You have any idea what day it is today? - No! - It's Sunday. - So? - It's the day I pay my respects. - Pay your respects? - For them that believes, it's the Lord's day. - Now, hold it, hold it, look, look, this is a fresh trail. Now all we gotta do is a couple more hours of hard ridin', we can catch 'em! - Well, what we're about to do, we gonna need all the help we can get. (teeth clicking) Come on, boy, ya! - What the? Aw, doggone it! Hey! - Psst! Your hat. Hey. You want your Becky back alive, don't you? - Well sure. - Then ask him. Go ahead and pray, he won't bite ya. Oh. - Well, Lord, sir, whatever you are. I ain't much and I never claimed to be. If I did wrong, I'm sorry for it. I always try to do the best I can, but somehow I always end up eatin' dirt, but not this time. You took my boy, but don't take Becky. If you do, it'll kill Dora. And I know she never did anything against ya. I ain't gonna promise I'm gonna do right or change, but if you do this, give me back my little girl, I'll sure as hell. Excuse me Lord, I'll sure try. - It seems you have journeyed far. Let me offer you the hospitality of our savior's mission. - Well, thank you, father. - Well now, sorry now, but we've got pressing business. - Is this pressing business in God's will? - You can be sure of it. - When you first rode in, I was curious. You resembled the men who serve the evil one, the plague of my country. The man called El Grande. - El Grande? Well, Charlie Gordon ran him all the way to Mexico. - He comes out of the hills not more than four or five hours from here. He has come often, mocking our savior, pillaging, driving away those who would find sanctuary here. - Can you find this place of his, will you lead us there? - No one returns from Hell. You will die, both of you. - Father, will you take us there? - Will ya? Father? (suspenseful music) - That is their town, no one else remains. - Thank you, Father. - The Lord be with you, my son, for surely we shall meet in heaven. - Let's go down for a closer look. - Come on. Well, you think your daughter's down there? - Well, that guard ain't around that hut there lookin' after chickens. Look, if I could make it down to that hut, I could have a clear run across. - You're loco. You wouldn't get two feet in there. - Well, you got a better idea? - No, I'm plum out. - Uh huh. (gun smashing) (birds chirping) (chickens clucking) (people chattering) - Whiskey. Thank you. Oh, by the way, do you know where I can find El Grande? - What did you say? - [Man] Whiskey! - I'd like to know where I can find El Grande. - That's a mighty dangerous question to ask around this town. - Well, I hear he's always lookin' for joiners, and I got into a little trouble across the river, and I need a base. - Now, you listen and hear me good, I'm gonna finish this drink. When I do, you be long gone, hear me, boy? - Oh, I hear you. Do you know where I can find El Grande? - Hey! - Don't do that, Mister. I'm a mite nervous. Now all I wanna do is just find Mr. El Grande. - [Barnes] Why? And to what do I owe this honor? (upbeat organ music) - You El Grande? - It's a name ostentatiously bestowed upon me by the natives of this island. I myself prefer Barnes, Roger Barnes. (whistling) - You sure ain't what I'd thought you'd... Well, what I mean Mr. Barnes is that, I heard-- - Yes, yes, yes, yes, I know what you heard. And now my ask you why you are honoring us with your presence? - Well, I heard that you were always looking for extra hands, and if you are, that would please me real fine. - I see. Yes, I see. And you think you qualify for membership in our little group? - Yes, sir, Mr. El Grande. You see, I got me into some trouble with a law man across the river. - Really, across the river? A law man, how very interesting. - Well, he's been following me for quite a ways, and I had to leave him in the bush a ways back over there. - You dirty, no account, mangy little Black Indian! I'm gonna knock your head off! - Gentlemen, gentlemen, please! We abhor violence here. Is this the law man you left in the brush? - What? What lawman? - Yeah, lawman! Give me that pocket! - You're gettin' bad habits, son! - See that, that proves it, don't it? He's a rotten federal marshal! Chased me outta Texas halfway into Mexico. Why you mangy! (people shouting) (objects crashing) You better make this look good, it's our only chance. - I intend to. (people shouting) (fists smashing) - [Man] Hit him, hit him! - [Man] Ah, get him! - You know something, you can quit anytime. Ain't none of your friends watchin'. (people shouting) - [Man] Come on now! (objects crashing) (people shouting) - Begin. (gun blasting) - Hold it! - Lock up... that one. - Hey! - Obviously you are imminently acceptable to us. - Well, I sure am glad to hear that, Mr. Grande. I sure am. (cheerful whistling) (chickens clucking) (people chattering) Ooh-whee! Maybe you can keep drinkin' this stuff all day, but it's beginning to make me a mite dizzy. - Come on, it's my turn to buy. - No, thank you. No, sir. I think it's about time for me to get me a bit of air. (smashing) (groaning) (thudding) (keys rattling) (latch rattling) Hello, Mr. Paxton. - It took you long enough. - Well, I'm sorry I couldn't bring the troops. - Oh, you'll do. Did you see her? - Yeah. - So? - She's all right. But they gettin' ready to sell them girls by nightfall so we better run and bust 'em out. - Well, the sooner the better. (thrilling music) - All right, you go saddle up the horses, and I'll go get your girl. - Wait a minute, that's my job. - It's only fair for me to tell you, Mr. Paxton, that there's three more in there with your Becky. I don't figure that we can just take your Becky out and leave the rest of them there. - Three more, huh? - Uh huh. - Well, you better saddle up six horses, go on! - All right. (clicking) (whacking) Becky? Becky? - Pa, oh, Pa! - Becky, Becky girl. Listen, we got no time now. Hurry up, girls, all of ya. Come on, we're goin', get outta here! Come on, come on, let's go! Shh! Here we go. (suspenseful music) Come on, hurry up! Just look at 'em. El Grande will catch us in 100 yards. - Then I guess I'll just have to keep 'em busy. - We'll both keep 'em busy. Here, Becky. Now, look, you see that trail up there? I want you to head due north. About four, five hours ride from here there's a mission. We'll meet you there. - But, Pa. - Don't but Pa, come on now, get goin', hurry up. Come on, hurry up, come on, hurry up. (hands clapping) Let's go. (horse hooves pattering) We can only have five minutes. - All right, Mr. Paxton, you'll get your five minutes. - Hey! (men chattering) - You mind if I join in? - It'll be a pleasure. (horse whinnying) - One. - Up to you. - But I gotta know. Do a flush beat a straight or is it the other way around? (horses neighing) (gun blasting) - Hey! Barnes, Barnes! - Ja, ja! (gun blasting) - Barnes, he's stampeding our horses. (gun blasting) (objects crashing) (gun blasting) (guns blasting) (bottle smashing) (fire crackling) (men shouting) (gun blasting) - About time. (guns blasting) (thrilling music) (thrilling music) (horse hooves pattering) All right, girls, let's go, come on, hurry up. - Father, you better come with us. There's a whole hornet's nest comin' behind us. - No, my son, I have never run from them before. Go with God. - Father, you too, you go with God. - Come on, let's go, hurry up! Whoa, ho, go ahead now, go ahead, go ahead! - Whoa, boy. - You see anything? - Not yet. - They'll be comin' all right. - Yeah, but we're far enough ahead now, Mr. Paxton, I think to give them ladies a rest for a spell. - Just as soon as we get outta this open country. Now, please keep watch 'cause they'll be comin' in soon. All right? We'll be right up ahead. - Pa? - Huh? - That man with you, is he a friend? - Yeah, yeah, he's a friend. (thrilling music) (guns blasting) - They're right behind me. - How many? - Everybody. Now, look, I can hold 'em off from here. Why don't you get goin', huh? - No, you don't, I'm stayin'. You get the girls to the border. - Mr. Paxton, how much chance you think I got with a group of white women goin' through Texas? Now will you get goin' please! (horse hooves galloping) - Get down, get! (rifle cocking) Becky, two miles east of here theres a road leads you into the town of Tulca. There's an army post there. You get there as fast as you can and send help. Hurry up now, get goin'! (horse neighing) (guns blasting) - [Barnes] Get down, get down, take cover! (shouting) (guns blasting) - You're supposed to be halfway to Tulca by now. - I figured it'd be better if I came back. Give the girls more time. - That's what you figured, huh? - That's what I said, didn't I? Now, why don't you stop your yappin' and get to shootin'? (guns blasting) They oughta be there about now. Let's see if we can get outta here. - Mr. Paxton, those are the sweetest words I ever heard. (guns blasting) - Hold your fire, hold your fire! (thrilling music) They're getting away, get your horses! - [Man] Get in there, ho, ho! (guns blasting) (horse neighing) (water splashing) (gun blasting) (water splashing) (men shouting) (guns blasting) (men shouting) (guns blasting) - That's it, they're on our side of the river now, yo! (guns blasting) (groaning) (gun clicking) (horse neighing) (water splashing) (fists smashing) - Damn. (fist smashing) - Been swimmin'? (water splashing) - Becky! Becky, oh! Baby, are you all right? - Yeah. - Come on. - Sam, I guess I'll be headin' out. - Where to? - Back to Abilene. - Well, I wanna... I wanna thank ya. - There's no need. - Oh, uh. When you get back, say hello to Charlie Gordon for me, will ya, Zeke? - I'll do that, Sam. Come on, boy. (majestic music)
