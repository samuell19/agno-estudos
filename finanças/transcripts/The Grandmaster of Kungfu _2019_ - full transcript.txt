In the late Qing Dynasty, the great powers invaded China and gradually ran amuck from the capital to its surrounding areas. Tianjin was the land of martial artists, where the great powers didn't dare to step in. Emperor Guangxu approved the Regulations of the Imperial University of Peking. It became an opportunity for Japan to invade Tianjin. At that time, in Tianjin, a martial contest was held for the leadership of the Wushu Association. In Tianjin, martial artists from gentlefolk come out in succession. I really appreciate your respect for letting me handle the Wushu Association as an aging man with no talent. Today I will retire after the martial arts contest. Within the duration of that burning joss stick, each school can appoint anybody to take the challenge at will. Losers will receive a pack of silver. The last person standing will be the new president. Masters. It's showtime! Let me be the first one. Who is that? Master Feng, someone is stealing your thunder. MARTIAL ARTS From Xingyi boxing style, I'm Sun... Master Sun, no need to stand on ceremony. We both know each other. Come on! - Bravo! - Bravo! Let me meet you head-on! Tongbei boxing style, Zhao Zhenpan! - You won't let me talk again? - Save your words! Can a woman join in a martial contest? What's your problem? You'd better defend yourself. - Bravo! - Impressive! The rest can come at me together! Does anyone else want to have a try? President. Master Feng, is this your delivery? Who is this rube? - Who is this country bumpkin? - Indeed. Masters, my name is Huo Yuanjia. Huo Yuanjia? I was busy with porter errands. Did I miss it? No. Everyone can join the contest before that joss stick burns out. I'm lucky. You're just a porter. Do you dare to fight me? I'm afraid you are not qualified. Master Zhao, are you afraid to fight a porter? He is challenging you right now. Don't be a coward. If you don't dare to fight him, let the porter be the president. Yes, let the porter be the president! Exactly! With five movements, I will overpower you! Huo Yuanjia, Mizong boxing style. He really knows a thing or two. - Bravo! - Bravo! This porter really has some skills. Master Zhao, how many movements are there? Are you done? - Bravo! - Bravo! He was beaten. What a pity. Thank you. Master Huo, this is your pack of silver. Thank you, President. News for you! Emperor Guangxu approved the Regulations of the Imperial University of Peking! Here's a sneak peek. Japanese are going to exchange Western learning in our country! Extra! - The martial contest was held today. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. - News for you! - Let's go. - News for you! Dongge. It is the third time I'm asking you to wash your hands for dinner. No. I want to practice martial arts and be a man like my father. What? You should just focus on your studies at your age. Dongge! Father! Only when you study hard will I teach you kung fu. Yes, I got it. Good boy. Put your stuff down and get ready for dinner. Not for me. I have to go to a gathering of the Wushu Association tonight. Nothing is more important than accompanying our kid. You Japanese want to open a martial art school in Tianjin? It's impossible! Idiotic nonsense. YOSHIDA MASAICHI Anbei. Yes, sir. It's not up to you. This time, our presence is a mere formality. According to the Regulations of the Imperial University of Peking, the imperial court has approved this official document. THE IMPERIAL COURT APPROVES OF THE JAPANESE MARTIAL ART SCHOOL - Come on, please help yourself. - Please. The new generation exceeds the old. Master Zhao shocked everybody today. You deserve the title. Everybody, let's toast to President Zhao. - Thank you for all your support. - Come. - Congratulations. - Congratulations, President Zhao. YANBIN RESTAURANT President. I'm just a nobody now. Yuanjia, I thought you wouldn't come tonight. This is the rule of the Wushu Association in Tianjin, and I have the sense to appreciate your favors. My foremost intention was to let you take over the position, so I invited you to participate in the contest. I'm just a porter. How can I be qualified for the position? Besides, Master Zhao is famous for his kung fu. He lives up to the expectation of the public as the president. Let's go together to congratulate Master Zhao. No problem, after you. Let's go. - Former President, please. - Please. Isn't that Huo Yuanjia? Why is he here? I have mixed feelings about today's martial contest. Joyous and fearful. I'm joyful as martial artists from gentlefolk come out in succession in Tianjin. Zhenpan became the president after defeating other heroes. I'm fearful as the essence of kung fu is to defend rather than attack others and to conceal rather than to reveal. The world is a brand new one. If we defend ourselves by practicing Mizong boxing style, we may get bullied. Am I right? Master Huo. I don't know much. All I care about is kung fu itself. The Tongbei style is fierce and full of power, which displays attack more than defense. Mizong is a combination of softness and hardness. It gives attention to all directions and attacks while defending oneself, which displays the meaning of concealing. Good explanation! I propose a toast to you. If you can take it, I'll approve of the Mizong boxing style for the moment. The Tongbei boxing style stresses the free movement of two arms. The strength is passed through clothes and the sound made is crisp and chill. The movements are well-organized and unpredictable. It's so powerful to attack. Why should we defend with it? The Mizong style stresses actions of swing, slap, roll, capture, jump, cut, hang, entanglement, evading, and returning. The body movements imply a profound theory. The opponent can be defeated within one or two movements. The Mizong style doesn't have a school. It has no disciples. How can it revitalize martial arts? Master Huo, my name is Chen Zhen. I'm a handyman in the Wushu Association. If you don't mind, please take me as your disciple. Chen Zhen. Come to your feet, please. Master Zhao, I apologize for disturbing your joyful moment. I shall excuse myself. YANBIN RESTAURANT Master Huo. Master Huo. Will you take me as your disciple? Master Zhao defeated me, and now he is the president. I'm not qualified. Master Huo, I have seen it all. Your last movement saved Master Zhao. Otherwise, he would die. Chen Zhen, what is your purpose in practicing martial arts? Defeat others and become the top martial artist in Tianjin. You'd better have a second thought before coming to me. Every move must be steady and ruthless when we play chess. The establishment of our martial art school is the first step to enter China. This move must be stable. I will prove that Chinese martial arts are vulnerable through my actions. Well done. Bear this in mind. It is easy to kill an opponent, but difficult to completely destroy his will. PROTECT YOURSELF Yes, sir. Dongge. Father. Did you make your mother angry today? Yes, I did. Mother didn't allow me to practice martial arts. Well, really? Look at you covered in stinky sweat. Change your clothes. What's this? Someone sent it here this noon. It's an opening ceremony invitation from a new martial art school. Yuanjia. Master Yu. Master Yu. Yuanjia, your father and I are family friends. You are my nephew. Let's skip the formalities. Just call me Uncle Yu. Uncle Yu. Uncle Yu. Don't be rude. Call him Grandpa Yu. Grandpa Yu. Uncle Yu, this way, please. Why is the door still closed? Master Sun and Master Gao also received the invitation. Master Feng. Maybe this new school will surprise us in an unexpected way. We've been waiting for so long. - President Zhao. - President Zhao. "Red Flower Martial Art School." The door is opening. President Zhao, please. - President Zhao, after you. - Please. Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go. What's this? This martial art school is owned by the Japanese. - How could this be? - It's owned by the Japanese. - Seriously! - Why did you Japanese come to Tianjin to open a martial art school? - So it is. - Master Feng. This surprise is overwhelming. What's this? This is an invitation from a new martial art school named Red Flower, which opened today. This is also the reason why I am here today. Are you also interested in martial art schools? My nephew, you may not know that the current situation is chaotic. All parties are like evil spirits. Therefore, I hope that you can establish a Jingwu gymnastic association to resist foreign powers with Chinese martial arts and defend Tianjin. I appreciate your kind suggestion. However, martial artists come out in succession in Tianjin. I'm not qualified to shoulder this responsibility. Also, I don't want to be involved in the chaotic circle of swordsmen. - Here. - Be careful. Don't scorch the table. Have a drink. I'm Yoshida Masaichi. Nice to meet you. Thank you for coming today. Thank you. - What did he say? - What's this nonsense? The opening of Red Flower Martial Art School symbolizes the beginning of the Western learning exchange of Japan, the co-prosperity in the Greater East Asia sphere, and the unity and combination of Japanese and Chinese martial arts. Nonsense! Get lost! Even a child won't believe your words. - Stop lying. - Get out of here! What are they talking about? They said some inappropriate words. If I remember correctly, there is an old saying in China that action speaks louder than words. Since everyone is here today, I want to see which one is more impressive, Chinese martial arts or Japanese Aikido. How dare you Japanese walk all over us? Anbei. If you're not convinced, accept the challenge. You are going too far! I'll teach you a lesson today! - Right! - Teach them a lesson! - Master. - Master. - Are you okay? - You're so merciless. Do you want to kill him? Chinese martial arts are unimpressive. Chinese people are the "Sick man of East Asia." That's too much! How vulnerable. As the president, I'll handle it. - President Zhao! - President! - President Zhao, take care. - President. Master Zhao, stop it. Stop talking. - President Zhao! - President Zhao! Master Huo! Master Huo! Please go and have a look. The Wushu Association is fighting with Red Flower Martial Art School. It is said that Master Zhao was almost beaten to death. Wait a second. President Zhao! - Master Zhao. - President Zhao. Are you all right? - President Zhao! - Master Zhao! Well done. Excuse me! Master Zhao, are you all right? - Master Zhao. - President Zhao. Master Huo. Don't let the Japanese look down on Chinese martial arts! I feel guilty about the things I did to you before. Today, I apologize for it sincerely. Master Huo. You must keep the dignity of Chinese martial arts. We can't... We can't and shouldn't be defeated by them. - Master Zhao. - Master Zhao. Master Zhao! Hurry up. - Take him to the hospital. - Hurry up! - Hurry up. - Let's go. Chinese are all cowards. Good job, Anbei. SICK MAN OF EAST ASIA Well done. Stand still! RED FLOWER - Bravo! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Bravo! Beat him! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Good job! - Awesome! - Awesome, Master Huo! - Good! - Good job! - Awesome! Don't let him go! You are bullying the weak, which disobeys the rule. Watch your back! - Bravo. - Bravo. Well done. Well done, Master Huo. - Bravo. - Bravo. Bravo... You scoundrel! Aim the guns! Get ready to shoot. Stop it. Colonel. You're quite impressive. What's your name? Mr. Takeda asked what your name is. Bastard! You are the winner. Let's stop here. I hope that we can jointly build martial arts in Tianjin. He hopes that in the future, we can jointly build martial arts in Tianjin. Build it together. Tianjin belongs to China. He says that Tianjin belongs to China. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. - Well done. - This way. - Let's go. - Let's go. You were unrelenting. This... Darn it. FUNERAL MEMORIAL TABLET OF ZHAO ZHENPAN FUNERAL - What are you doing here? - Why are you here? - Get out of here! - Get out! - What are you doing here? - Get out! - Get out! - What are you doing here? - Get lost! - Leave! Why are you here? Master Huo. I'm so sorry for your loss. Master Huo, we are so sorry for your loss. Mr. Takeda is here to apologize with his followers. Anbei. Master Zhao is dead. Your apology is meaningless unless you pay it with your life! - Exactly! - Pay it with your life! - Your apology is meaningless! - Your apology means nothing! Master Huo. For the friendly exchange of Chinese and Japanese martial arts, we plan to establish a Sino-Japanese Association of martial arts and want to invite you to be the Chinese President. This is an invitation for you. Martial arts in Tianjin are declining. Only with the exchange can you rejuvenate it. It's also the trend of co-prosperity in the Greater East Asia sphere. Only the Sino-Japanese exchange can rejuvenate martial art in Tianjin, which is the trend of co-prosperity in the Greater East Asia sphere. This is our business. We can deal with it on our own. He said that Chinese affairs should be settled by the Chinese themselves. IN THE LATE QING DYNASTY, THE GREAT POWERS INVADED CHINA AND TIANJIN WAS OCCUPIED. Get out of the way. Move out of the way. What are you doing? - This is our martial art school. - Move! What are you doing? Get out of the way. - What's your purpose? - What are you doing? Get out of the way. What are you doing? Colonel. Are there any arrangements for me this time? What happened to the Wushu Association? What do you mean? Why did you propose to the superiors to shut down martial art schools? Sorry, Colonel. Our plan is right at the key stage, and I didn't have the time to tell you. The Wushu Association poses a big threat to Tianjin. They won't just sit still and do nothing. If you want to defeat the Chinese, the best way is to defeat them in their proudest way. Isn't there a more direct way to defeat them by shutting down the martial art schools? You fool. Sorry, sir. Are you teaching me how to arrange things? I have my own way of dealing with the Tianjin government. Yes, sir. - Master Huo... - Huo Yuanjia... - Master Huo... - Huo Yuanjia... What's happening? - Master Huo. - Master Huo. Our martial art schools were closed by the Japanese. They even shut down the association. - Yes. - How could it be? Japanese have already been walking all over us. As martial art practitioners, we cannot bear it! - Master Huo. - Master Huo. We have to ask for an explanation from the Japanese. Master Huo, we cannot bear it anymore. Stop arguing. The shutdown of martial art schools doesn't concern us. - You're so rude. - Indeed. You! How could you talk like that? It relates to the entire martial art circle in Tianjin. Moreover, Yuanjia is a part of our circle. - Yes. - Indeed, he is a part of it. You guys can go by yourselves as you wish. Don't count Yuanjia in. - Dear, that's enough. - How can you say that? - You merciless woman. - How could you say that? All right! Huo Yuanjia! If you don't want to go with us, we'll go by ourselves. Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! Let's go on our own! Dear, I'll be back in a while. RED FLOWER MARTIAL ART SCHOOL - Japanese people, come on out! - Come on out! - Get out! - Come on out! How dare you shut down our martial art schools! - Exactly! - Indeed! - Who do you think you are? - Come on out! Stupid Japanese, get out! Get out! Why are you here today? Why did you shut down our schools? How dare you do it! - Yes, you don't have the ability. - Exactly. Understand that the place where you stand now is the territory of the Empire of Japan. - Nonsense! - Ridiculous! Raise the guns! If these people dare to take a step forward, shoot them immediately. Everybody, don't step forward! Otherwise, they'll shoot. Fine, just shoot! Aim here. - Let me see if you have the guts. - Shoot if you dare. Load the guns. Raise your guns. - Get ready to shoot. - Major. Major, please wait a moment. Lower the guns. Who is it? These beasts. Colonel. Who gave you permission to shoot? It was these Chinese people who came first to fight. Idiot. Sorry, sir. The international image of Japan will be ruined once the guns are fired. Yes, sir. What tricks are they playing next? In this world, only great countries and people can survive. In this world, only great countries and people can survive. The Empire of Japan is the strongest in the world. The Empire of Japan is the strongest in the world. - Nonsense! - Ridiculous! If you are not convinced, I can hold a martial arts contest. In three days, you can assign a representative to compete against me. If you are not convinced, he can hold a martial arts contest. In three days, you can assign a representative to compete against him. - No problem! - Bring it on! If you win... If you win... You can continue to operate martial art schools in Tianjin. You can continue to operate martial art schools in Tianjin. - What a joke! - What's this? If you lose... If you lose... - You need to close all martial art schools - So what if we lose? and get out of Tianjin. - What did he say? Tell us. - Hurry up and tell us! You need to close all martial art schools and... get out of Tianjin. - Why? - Why? - Why should we? - Why should we move out of Tianjin? Cowards! You losers couldn't even beat me. You're not qualified to fight with Colonel Takeda. Who are you looking down on? - You have gone too far. - Exactly! I'll take the challenge. - Master Huo. - Master Huo, you're here. That's great. Master Huo is here. Master Huo. Master Huo. Master Huo. It won't be a problem for him to defeat all of them. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. Master Huo. You have to fight for us. Are you really planning to do so? What's the matter, my dear? Father, Mother, I'm done. Look at this. Do you know how dangerous it is to attend the martial arts contest this time? Have you ever thought about our kid and me? I have no choice. This contest is not only a question of winning or losing, but the fact that the Japanese want to control Tianjin and even the whole of China by winning the match. I care nothing about winning or losing. Don't you think family outweighs your career? Your life will be in danger this time. I don't want my kid to lose his father at such a young age. What I represent is not myself, not Tianjin, but the whole of China. Without a complete and peaceful China, how can we enjoy our family life? All right, don't be mad at me anymore. My dear, you'll definitely win the match. Thank you, my dear. Colonel Takeda. What are you doing here? How are you preparing for this Sino-Japanese martial arts contest? I'm ready for the losers. Bravo! The cabinet members and journalists will attend this contest. We must show the spirit of Japanese martial arts in an impartial way. Let the Chinese people lose fair and square. What if... But... I mean, if you lose the match, it will influence our future plans. I won't be defeated. Huo Yuanjia is a close rival. A great rival makes for a great Samurai. I mean what if... If you lose the match out of expectation, what matters is not only your victory or defeat, but also the glory of the entire Japanese Empire. What's more serious is that it will delay the entire plan of the occupation of China. Idiot. Do you think I can't see your trickery? Save it. Japanese martial arts are invincible. I will defeat Huo Yuanjia thoroughly. Yes, sir. CHINESE MARTIAL ART SCHOOLS CLOSED DUE TO THE PRESSURE FROM THE JAPANESE ARMY. SOCIAL UNREST WENT ON. PEOPLE BECAME DESTITUTE AND HOMELESS. THEY WERE SUFFERING. Anbei. Yes, sir. Have you arranged everything yet? Yes, I have. Good job. Make sure Huo Yuanjia can't see the sun tomorrow. I've been waiting for this chance to take revenge for such a long time. Yuanjia. Yuanjia. This thing can bless you. You can win the match tomorrow. Master Huo, Master Yu is waiting for you at the tea house to talk to you about something. Have a good rest, dear. Master Yu is looking for me. Yuanjia. It's nothing. Let's go. Uncle Yu, why do you want to see me this late at night? I'm so depressed and want to have a talk with you. How is your preparation for the martial arts contest tomorrow? I'll try my best, no matter what the result is. About the contest... Uncle Yu, please feel free to talk. You have to be the loser in the contest tomorrow. It's not easy for me either. The Japanese are bound to win this martial arts contest. If you defeat Takeda, the Japanese will do bad things to the people in Tianjin. If I let him win, will the Japanese stop trampling Tianjin? If Chinese people keep forbearing time after time, we will always be oppressed. I have no better solution. I'm taking the whole situation into consideration. Don't be reckless. It's time for the lion to wake up. Please allow me to take my leave. IRON SHOP Master Huo. Come on. Doctor. Doctor! Doctor! Please save his life. Lie down, please. I'll prepare the medical equipment. Thank you, Doctor. It's done. Master Huo's vital organs were not injured. He'll get better with a good rest for a few days. Thank you, Doctor. Chen Zhen. What were you doing there? I was supposed to tell you something. But when I arrived at your house, your wife said you went to the tea house. So I went over there. What do you want to tell me? This martial arts contest is indeed a conspiracy of the Japanese. That's why they want to assassinate you at this critical point before the contest. They want to control Tianjin through this contest. It was planned beforehand. You may lose your life in this contest. Don't go, Master Huo. If you really join the match, you might fall into the Japanese's tricks with such a bad injury. Chen Zhen. Would you give up on it if you were in my position? Why are you home so late? - Let me go! - Mother! Stop resisting. - Let go of me. - Mother. - Take him. - Let go of me! Mother! Be quiet! Who's there? Father. - Don't move! - Father. Yuanjia. Yuanjia! Bastard. I know you are good. - Father. - If you lose the match... Dongge. Father. They'll be brought right back. If you win... Dongge. - Dongge. - Father! Dongge. Mother... - Take them away! - Come on! Yuanjia! Father! Yuanjia! Yuanjia! - Master Huo will win! - Master Huo must win! - Master Huo must win! - Master Huo will win! - Master Huo is the strongest! - Master Huo will win! - Master Huo will win! - Master Huo must win! He's here. - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... If I let him win, will the Japanese stop trampling Tianjin? If Chinese people keep forbearing time after time, we will always be oppressed. It's time for the lion to wake up. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. Master Huo must win the match! - Master Huo, come on! - Good luck, Master Huo! - Teach them a lesson, Master Huo! - Teach them a lesson. It's your show time, Master Huo. - Master Huo, come on! - Good luck, Master Huo! - Master Huo. - Master Huo. - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Master Huo. - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... Huo Yuanjia, please. - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... The Sino-Japanese martial arts contest is about to start. Now, let's welcome the Japanese contestant who once won 99 martial arts contests. He is Takeda Kamesaburo! Let's see who wins today. Now, let's welcome the next contestant who is from Tianjin, Huo Yuanjia! - Bravo! - Master Huo... - Master Huo... - Master Huo... Master Huo. You will surely defeat Takeda and make the Chinese proud! Yes. - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! TAKEDA HUO YUANJIA Good luck. The consent form has been signed. You're in a ruthless battle. Your death and life depend on fate. - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! Huo Yuanjia. Chinese people stress the concept of completeness. After defeating you, my career in martial arts will be completed. There is no need to figure out the winner or loser in a martial arts contest. That's what you Chinese think. The spirit of Japanese martial arts is particular about defeating opponents. This is why the martial art spirit exists. Chinese boxing is established on one's fine qualities. People who lack fine qualities will not master the essence of it. Chinese boxing is established on a country. Without a country, there will be no Chinese boxing. You will never understand this truth. Did you think about it when you killed Anbei last night? The loser has no status to talk. - Bravo! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! Well done! - Master Huo. - Master Huo. Master Huo, how do you feel? - Are you feeling all right? - Master Huo. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Master Huo. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. There is something wrong with Master Huo today. What happened to him? - We can't let it go on like this. - Right. Huo Yuanjia. I'll take revenge for Anbei. Mrs. Huo is locked in this room. I'll attract the army to come here and you guys can attack them from the back. Am I clear? Stay safe. Let's go. Go quickly. Hurry up. Unfasten the rope. Chen Zhen. Where is Yuanjia? Master Huo... Master Huo, hang in there! You can do it, Master Huo! Stand up. Hang in there! Master Huo... - Master Huo! - Hang in there, Master Huo! - Master Huo. - Master Huo. Master Huo, stand up! - Stand up! - Master Huo, hang in there! Master Huo, cheer up! - Master Huo. - Master Huo. Huo Yuanjia. Is it over so soon? You disappoint me so much. - Master Huo. - Master Huo. - Hang in there! - Stand up! - Stand up! - Stand up! Master Huo, hang in there! - Master Huo... - Master Huo... Master Huo. Stand up! - Master Huo... - Master Huo... Yuanjia! - Master Huo... - Master Huo... Master Huo. Stand up! - Master Huo, stand up! - Master Huo, go on! Master Huo... Master Huo, hang in there! Master Huo, stand up! Master Huo, hang in there! Master Huo... We Chinese people won't be defeated easily. - Bravo! - Well done! - Bravo! - Well done! Go for it! Damn it! Huo Yuanjia, I'm so proud of you. We won! We won! - We won! - We won! Get out of China! We won! Master Huo won the match! Master Huo, good job! I defeated you today. It doesn't mean Chinese martial arts are better than Japanese martial arts. Martial art is to apply it in seeking peace instead of... using the strength to bully the weak. Even though the Chinese treat people with courtesy, we'll never be bullied and humiliated by anybody at will. - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... I declare that the winner of this martial arts contest goes to Huo Yuanjia! - Bravo! - Well done! We won! We won! - We won! - We won! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia! - Huo Yuanjia... - Huo Yuanjia... My dear. I'm starving. Let's go back home. I'll cook for you. THE END
