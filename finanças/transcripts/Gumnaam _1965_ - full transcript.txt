Mr Sohanlal! Inform the police. Go on! This is Khanna speaking. The work is done. You must keep another death certificate ready. Send the will to its rightful place. The will shall reach you by morning. Do the needful. Dear Asha, your uncle has met with an accident. And he is dead. No! It can't be true! This is true. My heartfelt condolences are with you... You? Today is the Silver Jubilee of the Princess Club. On this joyous occasion,... the club has presented you with a variety of programmes. But the most interesting programme will be presented now. We now present the winners of the lucky draw. The winners will be sent abroad on a chartered flight... on a 2-week complimentary holidary abroad. Here are their names. Barrister Rakesh! Mr Dharamdas! Mr Kishan! Miss Kitty! Dr Acharya! Mr Madhusudan Sharma! And Miss Asha. They are the seven lucky winners... who leave for a foreign holiday. I hope this is the best vacation of their life. This is Captain Bhatia speaking to you. Due to a technical snag in the engine, we will have to force-land. Do not panic and fasten your seat belts. We are doing our best to land safely. It will take us 2 hours to repair the engine. You can take a stroll till then, if you wish. It's a nice place. What if they can't fix the engine? Well...?,- How will we go? We've had to force land because of the snag. We will leave, once it is repaired. I have nothing to do with this. I know nothing. It's very late. And Anand hasn't returned yet. We've been wandering around for so very long. When we couldn't find a place to live in, how can he? Even if he does find a place, do you think he'll return? Why don't you believe me! Anand is responsible for all this. We will soon know. There he is! Any success? - No. No trace of human life. What shall we do now? - Rest. Let's leave it to the one who brought us this far. By then I'll starve to death. I'm so very thirsty. Then drink this. - God! You want to corrupt me! You're joking instead of finding some shelter! In this dangerous jungle... - You folks are far more dangerous. Sit here. I'm leaving on my own. Don't worry. She'll return on her own. Has the entire entourage arrived? I've been waiting for you for a whole a week. Which means you knew about our arrival. Old man, what nonsense are you talking? Who else but you could've arrived? I've made all the arrangements for you. Arrangements? Who are you? I'm the cook. I am the butler. And shall take care of all your comforts. Come, doctor. - Wait! How did you know I'm a doctor? - I'm not a fool. Well, Mr Sharma? - You know my name too. I know everyone. You are Mr.Sharma and she's Ms.Kitty. Aren't I right? And he is Mr.Dharamdas. He is omniscient. Is he human or a ghost? Why are you so apprehensive? This note contains everything. Why are you snatching it? It doesn't include your name. So tell me your name. I'll make arrangements for you too. Where will you, now that you are here? Follow me! C'mon upstairs! What are you doing there? They all seem nice and healthy. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... And now the eighth one too. I'll have to make arrangements for him too. Why are you staring at me? Haven't you ever seen a handsome man? All said and done, he's an interesting man. He has taken care of all our comforts. There are enough of groceries too. Mr. Sharma, do you intend to make us stay here all our lives? My intentions differ slightly. Now stop arguing, and start eating. Get some mutton for me. - Tomatoes and green chillis for me. Listen... bring vegetables for me. - Okay. Bring yogurt for me. - Okay. Do you have some pickle? - Only bitter gourd. I'll get it. I think we must help him. - Sure. Each one has a different choice... chicken and mutton indeed! I'm confused. One wants raw tomatoes another asks for tomato sauce. If I'm not mistaken, you are Mr.Sohanlal's niece? Yes...but what makes you ask? - Only casually. The food is delicious and you are a fun person too. Madame, do you want to devour me too? Who's interested in living anyway? - Then why don't you die? What is this? An account of the spices? Where are the vegetables? What are you reading so intently? This dairy bears the names of the travellers,... who have reached the end of their lives. This is for those who were strangers to each other... but now are companions in this last journey of life. By now, you must've realised,... that you are all victims of a conspiracy. Do you recollect that someone was a victim of your conspiracy too? All of you have been deliberately brought together today. You are all murderers, criminals and culprits. And you've been brought here to be punished. And the punishment is death for all of you, but in turns. What nonsense is this? - Don't kick up a fuss. It won't help. There is no way you can escape this ordeal. Just as you smilingly committed the crime,... so also you must accept the punishment smilingly. We won't tolerate empty threats. Who is behind this conspiracy? Why doesn't he face us? Does anyone else stay here too? - How would I know? Could be. Who was singing this song? - Maybe my mother! Put the knife away. That song is coming out of my ears. This is the hit song of the hamlet and is heard every where. As if there is a wandering soul in this hamlet. What? - Who else will stay here? I don't believe this. He must be lying. Someone must be staying here. - Madame, today is the first night. You will understand everything by and by Atleast finish your meal. Hearing of spirits makes them lose their appetite. If they encounter a live spirit they'll die! You seem to be quite smart. Since they've wasted all this, I'll feed them for breakfast. I've told you, Rake. I like alcoholics but not alcohol. Why'd I force you to drink? This is something which is offered willingly and had willingly, too. Isn't it, darling? I'm sorry to address you as darling, darling. That doesn't mean I'm drunk. Your eyes intoxicated me, otherwise I'm quite sober. Have a sip. - Please listen to me. Okay, I'll drink it myself. Just come over, if you're scared. I'm in the room next door. Why should I be scared? The protector is scared, not the destroyer. What can anyone steal from me? Don't say that... they could do so much to you, darling! There! I've got used to calling you darling. Open the door slowly. - I can't help it, sir. If I work slowly, how will I finish my work? Sir, what is this? - This is a "doorbin" (binocular). "Been"? (a pipe) Let me use it to charm snakes. This is used to see faraway things closely. Oh, I see. Can you see the pavements of Secunderabad? Prepare me a cup of tea. - No, sir. I bring the tea. It's for you to make it... That's all! Give me a call... I'm young at heart! Where are you, Madame? - I am here. How will I talk to you if you remain standing in there? Come out and see, I've brought a cup of hot tea for you. Come before it gets cold. What is it? - How much of sugar, Madame? I don't want tea now. I'm going for a swim. What? - For a swim. Do you intend to swim across the ocean? Everyone wants me to prepare some tea for them; but I refuse. And she refuses me! Are you going for a swim? A pain, sir? Then drink some tea. Instead of tea, bring me some fresh lime-water. Do you suffer a hangover? - You are very smart. Are you going for a swim? - Yes. Go ahead! I too will join you later. You are fond of swimming and I love catching things that swim. I mean fishing. - Then come on. How she walks! - And how are you? Is breakfast ready? - What a hog! Didn't you get your fill ogling at her? Go and get my breakfast. First brush your teeth; your mouth is stinking! The first time I ogle at a girl.... and I get caught. You're fond of taking pictures, aren't you? That's right. You must be fond of stealing pictures too. If the picture were good, it'll remain etched in my heart. Where is my photograph? - Your photograph? Perhaps in my eyes. - I talk of my uncle's snap. You uncle's snap must be in your heart. You are insolent! Insolent is one who crosses the limits of decency. Is your uncle's snap really missing? - D'you think I'm lying. I'm sorry, but there's no police station around. Otherwise I'd have accompanied you to lodge a complaint. Thanks! - Please listen. What is it? - Thanks! Had your uncle been here, I'd click a new picture of him. Thanks! - Thanking doesn't end the matter. I want to tell you something. - What? That this place and our companions are so strange. I can see that. - Say what you want... but remember, there is danger lurking at every step. If there is anyone who can protect you... it's your truly. May I go? - Sure, but don't venture out alone. Our destinations may differ. - It could be the same. Try it out. If you hurt your foot, it will be difficult to walk. Life with you in a few days will be difficult anyway. It's my life that has become difficult! Welcome, Dharamdas... Fond of fishing, aren't you? And what interest brings you here? I've been watching Miss Kitty spend a long time in the water. She's calling you! - Me? No. It's you she's calling. The water is very cold. Spend a little more time here and you'll be an expert at swimming. We'll have to stay here, because there's no way out of here. Our tormentor has wisely chosen this place. Come here! Quick! I've spotted a ship! The wielder of the knife and the fisherman are both missing. And Ms Kitty has a stomach-ache. Am I a machine to cook for so many people? It's late. They should've returned by now. There they are. Now sit for dinner. I'm sorry to be late. - Better late than never! Where is Kishan? - Wasn't he with you? No, I went aone and came alone. Didn't you even see him? - No. Then where could he be? We must look for him. He went of his own volition, he'll return on his own. If he's careless, we mustn't follow suit. I'll go and take a look. Better lay the food. Can't you see all this food? You ought to wear glasses! I've fried the fish you caught. You? - Didn't you say... that danger lurks at every step. Let's go together. - You want to accompany me? In search of Kishan. - Still better. Why did you laugh? It was not me, Anand. That voice, then? The butler was right. There is a spirit here. Come, let's go. He's not here either. - I wonder where he has gone. Let's look there. I found this letter near Kishan's body. I thought of reading it in everyone's presence. It says... "do not mourn Kishan's death because he was a murderer" "He ran over a man with his car..." "who was a victim of your conspiracy" And his name was Mr.Sohanlal. Dharamdas, why are your hands shaking? Did you know him? I know him. He was my uncle. It's so ironic that till this morning Kishan was with us,... and now... - I can still visualise that scene. When he stood atop the mountain to wave at the ship. Who knew death would claim him so soon! As far as I think, none of us saw him after this morning. And we found him dead at night. It means he was murdered in the evening. Dharamdas too returned late for dinner. You misunderstand! I've done nothing! Where did you find the dagger with which Kishan was killed? Dharamdas always keeps it under his pillow. Isn't it, Dharamdas? - This is a lie. It means that dagger was yours? You killed Kishan? You are a murderer. - This is a lie. I'm innocent. - Prove it. I think we'll give him time till tomorrow evening. But why don't you believe me? I have killed no one! It's a lie! It's a lie! One is gone. You toil so much... - That is my job, mister. Listen... - What? Who realises his duties nowadays? Do you realise your duty? Had you realised it, you'd have tipped me. Here you are. - How reluctantly you give! What will I have to do for this tenner? By God! You are a very smart chap. Why drag God into this? Give Him rest for a while. Only God will save me here. - Is that so? Tell me, who killed Kishan? - How'd I know about who... How can I tell you that? But I sure know that Lord Kishan had killed Kamsa. Not that Kishan; our Kishin. - Allah! I don't know but everyone was hinting at you. I did not kill anyone. Don't cry,... just prove it otherwise. Do you think the fish will testify for me? What are you trying to do? - You say... What? - That we were together. Or else they will kill me. Don't shift the blame on my shoulders. My life is more precious to me than yours. In which case, I value this tenner more than you. He's going to die... surely die! After all, Dharamdas has proved his innocence. Looks like a strong pair of hands choked him to death. The murderer is one of us. But who is he and what is his motive? And why isn't he facing us? You look upset. - Not really. So what are you thinking about? - Nothing. Who could be singing that song? Who knows? - Is it a stranger? Do you believe in spirits? What do you do in Bombay? - Nothing. What?! - My job is to serve others. What is your opinion about the murderer? What do you do in Bombay? - You've evaded my question. You haven't answered me either. Do you always smoke cigars? - Yes, why? I found a piece of cigar near Kishan's corpse. haramdas smoked cigars too. - That's true. But he was killed. There's someone... - What are you insinuating? That I am the murderer? - Don't feel offended. It's for me to dark a shot in the darkness. Who know? One might hit the target. Sometimes man himself gets targeted. I still maintain that I like alcoholics, not alcohol. Till we met, how did you know about my qualities? And this is still alien to you. Try it and you will befriend it. Isn't it enough that we're friends? - There's safety in numbers. Drink it. This will fulfil all the voids in your life. Why don't you say that I must get drunk so that you will... I know my way around, Rake. I know all these tricks. Which means you don't trust me. - Nor am I scared of you. Then drink it and bridge the distance between us. And suppose I don't drink it? - Then I'll force it. Sometimes you forget that you are up against Kitty. I've handled people like you all my life. Then let's see how you handle me. C'mon, drink it. It is not necessary to expose your character to everyone. There are decent people living here. Of course, and I've read their names in the diary. You had better leave. - This is Ms.Kitty's room. You'd better behave yourself. - Darling, then you ask him to leave. And close the door behind you. Look, I can't tolerate a woman being insulted. Get out, you have no chance here. Slowly does it.. care for your health, doctor. Good! That's a match! What are you both upto? Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? If we fight amongst ourselves, how will we trace the murderer? Go on... Go to your respective rooms. Kitty, beware of them. Where are you going? Please sit for a while. Poking fun at my old age? I am only complimenting you. The way you separated them was really commendable. I mean, for a person of your age. I've always had this bad habit... - Pardon me? I've always been fond of exercising. Perhaps that's why age has not reduced your vigour. Seeing your strength, I'm tempted to befriend you. So that even if I'm attacked, I can be saved. It is our duty to help each other. You? Why have you come here? - To know about Dharamdas' death. I've already told you. A strong pair of hands choked him to death. Strangulation wouldn't have turned the body blue, doctor. Dharamdas did not die of strangulation... someone has poisoned him. - I myself examined the body. I'm a doctor, I can't be mistaken. If you are a doctor, I too am a criminal lawyer. I've been practicing law for 15 years. I've sent many guilty men to the gallows. What do you mean? - My doubts are now confirmed... that the murderer is one of us. You may take another look at Dharamdas' dead body. The crime will itself reveal who the perpetrator is! What is the matter? - Who killed Dharamdas? What's the point in worrying about those who are dead? Let's worry about those who are alive. The old man is right. Instead of others, worry about yourselves. Worry about yourselves... worry about me! Go and attend to your work. - I'm doing my work, all right. What is your opinion about the butler? He's a harmless fellow. But there is surely someone behind all this. That's true. - How do we get to the murderer? Right. How do we get to the murderer? Madame, what are you doing in the kitchen? I wanted to know the menu. The menu is prawn curry with rice. But for you, there is a special menu. Shut up, you blackie! - Whom did you call that, madam? My black colour on a fair skin is considered a beauty spot. But any white on my dark skin is considered a disease. Oh my sweet heart! There is no dearth of beauties. I'll managee with my dreams. My dreams... Oh God, I've made a mess of my kitchen. I've ruined the food... How will I feed the free-loaders now? May I ask you something, Anand? - Go ahead. I have a feeling you are not what you appear to be. But you should know that I'm not what you suspect either. That's just what I want to know... who are you? Who are you? Why must you need an introduction? I'm the one you had scolded! Stop joking. What else can I do? Every moment spent in fun is well spent. Life is quite meaningless now. There's the fear of death at every step. I wasn't afraid when I came here. I wasn't much scared even after knowing the contents of the diary. I didn't attach much importance to death. But now... - My company makes you a coward? No. I don't want to die now. I am not alone. - I'll protect you from all harm. But there is no way of escape. I think we'll finally suffocate to death. Death will have to deal with me before reaching you. No one had any inkling of this whilst leaving Bombay. All this is a coincidence. And incidentally, we may even survive this. I hope so! - But we'll always be together. What happened? - Nothing. Go on home. - Are you going somewhere? I'll just check everything. You? - No Kitty, sir... his is male! You're mistaken. It was me washing the clothes. Ain't I a clever guy? - Oh God! Sir, can I tell you something? - Speak up. Give up drinking. It's an awful thing! Have you ever tasted it or are you just abusing it? My father was an ace drunkard. My veins have more alcohol than blood. No wonder your face is like this. Come here! Why is the doctor so frantic? - Someone has murdered Mr.Sharma. The contents of the diary were true afterall. The letter says, don't grieve Mr. Sharma's death. Because he had planned Mr. Sohanlal's death. I don't get this... There's no one here besides us. I think one amongst you men is the murderer. You left yourself out. Perhaps you too... How can you say such things? Had I wanted to kill you all... couldn't I have poisoned your food? Maybe you don't possess the poison. Well said! When I could arrange for the food,... when I could bring buffalos for milk... couldn't I've arranged for the poison? Don't you doubt me. The earlier ones died after a hearty meal. But the rest of you will die of starvation. I won't cook for you! She was only joking. You could never kill alone. Lay the food. - That's a nice joke! The food isn't ready yet. I'll bring it, when it's ready. You were right, Anand. One of us is surely the murderer. You, Anand or the doctor? - Perhaps! We must search each other's room. And discard any weapon found. I've no objection to my room being searched. You can gladly search my room too. What will we find in your room? - Where else? How was Mr.Sharma killed? You have not answered me. - What do you mean? The pick-ax used to kill Mr. Sharma was in your possession. I've no pick-ax in my possession. I myself saw you hiding it. Even when caught red handed, a thief doesn't accept his crimes. Why are you silent? Answer him, Mr.Rakesh. Even if that were true,... but then how was Dharamdas killed? By a pick-ax? No! He was poisoned. And only the doctor had that poison. The empty bottle of which be hid in the vase that night. This is a lie. I have not poisoned anyone! I admit, I did have the poison. So too, I am innocent... though I did have a pick ax. Are you drowning your sorrows? - Not at all. No reason for that. Why should I feel offended? So you are mourning Mr. Sharma's death? What nonsense! With you around, I won't grieve even my own death. But are you alive? - Only outwardly. Actually, I died the day you called me Rake. But you haven't get accepted my love. You too haven't seen through someone. So have a drink today... for my sake. For your sake? Okay, I'll have it. Do you really love me? I've never spoken the truth. But when I do, I mean it. I don't understand this. What did that letter mean... that we shouldn't grieve Mr. Sharma's death... because he had master minded Mr. Sohanlal's death? That's a lie! I feel the conspirator was someone else. You are right. - But who is he? Some one. - How can you be so sure? Because I was Mr. Sohanlal's private secretary. Isee. So that's how it is! I think a drink more will loosen your tongue further. It was I who sent that will to you for alternations. Understood? No. - You too need a peg to comprehend. So darling, it means... - Everything happens for the best. Life is a gift and to find a confidante is a real boon! We are sailing in the same boat. Think it over! You too may not drown. I don't care. - Then let's leave it to fate. Hey butler, come here. - I'm coming. Where were you going? - Where can I go, sir? But what are you doing here? - I was taking some photographs. What? - Photographs. Take some of mine too. - Why? It will please my sister. - How? My sister has seen a girl for me. - What? If I send her my picture, she'll perform the marriage. Even if I click your picture, it will remain in the camera. Why? - No developing facilities. What is that? - Washing the film. Oh God, does one wash the photographs? But how will you send your photograph to your sister? There are no postal services here. Weren't the pigeons better couriers? - That's true! But cameras didn't exist earlier. - That's true! Can I smoke? - Sure. What did you do in Bombay? - I was a butler there, not Hitler. How did you come here? - In a boat. Alone? - Two buffaloes accompanied me. That boatman saw us off with our luggage and left. Who, in your opinion, is the murderer? Well, sir...? Trying to trap me with this cigarette? I just asked. - I don't know anything. Sir, now that your girlfriend is coming, I'll go my way. Seeing your wet clothes... I think you've taken great pains to find me. True. Anand, I came to give you some news. What? - Rakesh and Kitty are marrying. Had a marriage been possible here, we too won't remain bachelors. There is no means of getting married here. Though one can romance and make a commitment. They've decided to get married on reaching Bombay. Only if they survive this ordeal! Who knows who's turn it is to die today? Isn't it possible that Rakesh is the murderer? Which makes him sure that he will escape. Perhaps that is what makes Kitty so care free today. He will die. He too will be murdered. How can you be so sure? Who will kill him? Are you hinting at the doctor? I think all of us will be murdered. Don't say such things, Anand. I feel scared. No need to worry. No one will harm Mr. Sohanlal's niece. Because what will happen to the property after her death? You won't die, Asha! What are you saying? You speak as if... Yes, I'm saying it! Go away! And wait for me, should have faith in me. My identity and my deeds actions are a mystery. And the day the mystery is solved, you... Are you trying to suppress death with music? Death is a reality which we all have to face. Where is everyone? I've warned them to keep us informed of their whereabouts. But everyone ignores that. - No one is loyal to anyone. So the doctor has also been killed! He had Anand's name on his lips before he died. I've always suspected it. And the doctor has solved this mystery. Now don't ask me who killed the doctor. He took your name while dying. - That's is a lie. If you don't believe us, ask Asha! The doctor uttered my name before dying. Maybe he wanted to absolve me and hold Rakesh guilty. Maybe the doctor wanted to confide in me. You can't mislead us with that glib talk and hide the truth. It is clear. You are the murderer! You are the killer! You accuse me of being the killer. And I say, you are the murderer. The truth will be known only after another death. It's your turn now. It's your turn next. Your turn to die! You die now! You've come to the wrong place. This is my room. Let me stay here. I'm getting scared. Is Anand not in his room? - No. I went to look for him, but in the living room... I can't describe what I saw! There, the doctor, Dharamdas, Mr. Sharma's dead bodies,... were staring at me and warning me that it's my turn now. Scared of dying, are you? Life is, in fact, worse than death. Drink some... You will overcome your fear. I don't drink, Kitty. - Go on! You can't live in fear. Besides, the ones we suspect end up dead. But this... it gives you life even after death. Drink it. - No! Go on. Gulp it down! You? - Yes. How about you? - Yes, it's me. There is still some liquor remaining... drink that too! Why don't you drink? There is very little difference between you and Kitty now. You appear to be angry... Here, take a sip. Then you won't differentiate between me and Asha. You ought to be ashamed to introduce her to this poison. Don't worry, I won't die. And you don't give a damn even if I die. I mean nothing to you! Kitty, this chap, Anand... he loves me immensely. But no one knows who he is... not even me! You didn't like the bitter pill, did you? How can a liar fancy the truth? Go away, Anand! I don't need any support! You will not drink that, I say. - Why not? It isn't any more bitter than you are! I will drink it. I said you won't! - I will! You look upset. You don't appear to have slept last night? Kitty has told me about everything that happened last night. I think Anand... - Have you seen Anand? That's the only thing left to do. The rest... - What are you talking about? Just that he will never face us again. Anand has been proved to be the murderer. It can't be anyone else. I've already warned Kitty and am warning you too... not to venture out alone. - I am already scared. Kitty is not in her room and Anand too is missing. What? Who's that? Someone has killed Kitty too! Not someone... it's Anand. Look there. I've been waiting for that murderer all this while. But he didn't turn up. He has killed my Kitty. I won't spare you now. I will have my revenge. Please don't come closer, Rakesh. Please don't... I beg of you! Let me go! Where will you go? Every road here leads to death. Leave me alone. When death is inevitable, why remain hungry? Come to me and let's forget everything else. Please leave me alone. Let me go, Rakesh! Call me Rake just as Kitty did, darling. Now, you are Kitty and I am Rake. Where will you go? Shut up! And forget Anand. No one can reach here. Mr Sharma... you were supposed to be dead! No. My death was a ploy to mislead others. When I realised my game as up... and that Kitty and Anand suspected me,... I confided in the doctor. I told him there was only one way to nail the murderer. have an idea. We'll play a ploy to find the murderer. I'll injure myself and you declare me dead. Since you are a doctor, everyone will believe you. Then? - After I'm declared dead... I'll try to find the real culprit. And thus he proved me dead. After that, he was my first victim. Because I feared he may expose me. But you are exposed now. Now that you know the truth, you won't live for long. You would have been dead long ago. But I had a desire. I too have a desire, Mr.Sharma. Inspector Anand. We've been looking for you for many days. And we meet today. Won't you shake hands? Had I known you were a C.I.D inspector then... Perhaps you would've killed me too? Had I known you are the fugitive Madanlal,... had I known you are a devil in human guise... then maybe you wouldn't have been able to claim those 5 victims. I am the Lord of death. They were destined to die at my hands. I know everything. It was Khanna who got Mr Sohanlal killed... but you killed not only Khanna, but his friends too. You would've been exposed the day you killed Kitty. I gave you a chase and Rakesh chased me. You played a trick and escaped. You caused a smokescreen. Do you recognise me, inspector? This is Madanlal. And she is Asha. There is only one bullet left. I don't know where it is lodged. One bullet for two people! Let's see who deserves it. Before challenging me, you should've thought twice. I've already committed 6 murders. This is the seventh. This gun has only one bullet. Let's see who between you, does death favour? This word doesn't befit a criminal. Yes, I am a murderer! And who compelled me to kill? Who? - Mr.Sohanlal,... Khanna and his friends. We were partners in smuggling. How is it related to your being a murderer? I was arrested once. In prison, Sohanlal and Khanna assured me,... that if I admitted to my crime,... then on release, I'll get my due share. But they not only deprived me of my share... but raped my innocent sister too. She committed suicide. Now I won't spare you either. Who informed you of your sister's suicide in the jail? My brother did, but before he could harm Khanna... Khanna got him also killed. Khanna was a bastard. His greed made him kill Sohanlal too. You were released from the jail on the 13th of this month... when you went to Khanna's house and killed him. You are omniscient, inspector. On the 24th, on the occasion of the silver jubilee of Princess Club... you gave the lucky ticketsto five people... so that as per your plan they'd board the chartered plane,... to reach the place of their death. Though they were all Khanna's people... but they were strangers to each other. But you killed them brutally. Yes, I tortured them to death. Society and law could let them go scot free... but not me.- No! You've escaped again. - But you won't escape, Madanlal. You may kill both of us, but there's a third person too. The butler and his sister? So you know about it? - Yes, I do... about the spirit, and the mad girl who sings. She's the butler's siste. My condition to employ him was that he came alone. But he secretly brought his sister too. This time too you were saved. Perhaps the bullet is in this slot, inspector. Behold your beloved one last time. Maybe you won't get a second chance. You are very lucky! The decision is made now. You are fated to die firt. But I'm not heartless. I'll give you a chance too. to behold your beloved. Don't you ever dare sing that song again!
