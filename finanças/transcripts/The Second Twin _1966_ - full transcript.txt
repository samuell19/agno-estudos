BASED ON JEAN LABORDE'S NOVEL UN HOMME A PART ENTIERE What is it? Miss Nathalie Neuville? Yes, that's me. It's the police. We've got questions for you. Did you hear me? Yes, I'll open the door. Come up. The police are here at this time? What do they want? I don't know. Don't stay there, please. Go. The bottle, the glasses. -Hide in the kitchen. -Yes. -Why? -Morning visits are always concerning. We're just here to check something. Were you a friend of Olivier Lacat, the son of the architect? -Yes. -He was killed last night. Oh my God. -Did you see him often? -Well… Don't worry, I'll get the door. Oh, Chief. Hello Suzanne. Is Mr. Montaud in? -Yes, I'll tell him you're here. -Thanks. They think I'm stubborn. They haven't seen anything yet. Give me the expert's file. Vaden. Granted, I've been distracted recently, but you just don't listen. I'm working Suzanne. What's wrong now? Police Chief Lestrat is here. Fine, let him in. We'll carry on later. Hello sir. Hello Chief. -Sit down. -Thanks. Excuse the interruption, I won't keep you long. -Have you still got a lot of work? -I'm buried in it. -What's it about? -A crime. What's it got to do with me? Miss Nathalie Neuville. -Committed a crime? -Do you know her? -Is it a question or an affirmation? -No, thanks. She says you spent most of the night with her. -Yes, that's true. -So, why… Excuse me, I thought you were alone. Police Chief Lestrat. -My wife. -Ma'am. Sir. I wanted to ask you something, but I'll see you later. Chief, if this is awkward for anyone, it's me. Where were we? Why did you run away when I arrived? A reflex. An unfortunate one, I agree. When I heard "police", there were 1000 reasons why I… Naturally. What time did you arrive at Miss Neuville's? -Late. -That is to say? I had a dinner, then I took my wife home. It must have been 10 or 11 p.m. I'm sorry. I'm used to interrogations, but from the other side. We just need to confirm your alibi. -All this is very unpleasant. -More so for the victim. You've not asked his name. Olivier Lacat. Did you know him? Not personally. I know his parents. Do you have a lead? Do you have any clues? Yes, we're examining them. Sir, I have one last question. It's a bit of a delicate one. At this stage… Were you aware of the relations between Olivier Lacat and… Nathalie Neuville? DESFORGES ARMORY WEAPONS - AMMUNITION MAB PISTOL. 7.65. THE REVOLVER BELONGS TO ONE OF THE TOWN'S MOST IMPORTANT LAWYERS MR. MONTAUD'S ATTITUDE IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE FAMOUS LAWYER FLED THE HOME OF NEUVILLE WHEN THE POLICE ARRIVED GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY? WHAT FATE AWAITS THE CELEBRATED LAWYER? THE LACAT AFFAIR: DISCOVERIES MR. MONTAUD MET NATHALIE NEUVILLE AT THE HI-FI CLUB A YEAR AGO -It's catching on, isn't it? -Wonderful. -Does it have a name? -The kirki. -Crikey, it requires energy. -I'll teach you it. Thanks, that's kind but I'm going to bed. I need to be at my dad's construction site at 7 a.m. tomorrow. Nathalie! -I can't do it. -I already showed you. I know, but I can't do it. Be a trooper, grant me five minutes so I can get the hand of the rhythm. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. -Are you leaving? -Yes. -Can you take us? -Yes, of course. -Sorry, my bad. -No problem. -I feel like an ancestor. -What does that make me then? Good evening, gentlemen. Oh it's Mr. Vaden. -Hello. -Sit down. -Are you well known here? -Yes, I come from time to time. It's for your age group. It's a curious dance, do you not find? She's a pretty girl. -Invite her to sit with us. -No, sorry. She works here. She does it to pay her way through medical school. What a generation. -I'm sorry. -Good evening Nathalie. Good evening. -Mr. Delesser. -Miss. -Sir. -Mr. Pierre Montaud. -Miss Nathalie Neuville. -Sir. I recognized Mr. Montaud. Is it true that you would refuse to sit with us? -Absolutely. -Do you never drink? Sometimes, but with my friends. Let's be friends for a night. I won a memorable case today. If you don't sit with us, my victory won't be complete. -I'll take you home, I've got my car. -With pleasure, but on foot. After all that noise and smoke, I need some fresh air. Studies during the day, the club at night. You live a hellish life. Your life can't be all sweetness and light either. I can't believe you'll be a doctor one day. -Why? -Doctors are strict, serious. I'll be a joyful, smiling doctor who treats little kids. Kids are the luckiest. It's Montaud. I say… In the end we kind of do the same job. You save your clients' lives too. Yes, except mine don't deserve it most of the time. Maybe, but you defend them well. The only time I heard you during a court case, I was so taken by your defense speech that I wanted to run towards you. To kiss me? This is me. Goodnight. Goodnight. Does no one ever come up for a drink? Yes, my friends. And? It's not the same. And I need to be at the hospital at 7 a.m. Are you going to disappear behind that door forever? -No, what an idea! -May I see you again? Why not. LIVE MUSIC AND DANCING EVERY NIGHT You scared me! Less of the formality. -Did I sleep long? -A half hour or so. You… You sleep very prettily. Relaxed, with a little smile. Yes of course. Come on. Let go of me or you won't get your coffee. Go away. Go next door. How long has it been since you were last in a kitchen? Before I knew you, never. You are beautiful. Your skin is like silk, like satin. Yours is prickly! What does it matter, as I love you, as we love each other. We have lost so much time. I love you. Come on. You can carry the tray. -No! -Come on! I don't know if I'll be able to. I'm not in the habit. Wait. There. What would I not do out of love for you. There. -Do you like sugar? -I adore it. -You'll need to learn my tastes. -Well, there's no sugar left. -Does it worry you? -I'm in despair. -Oh really? -No -Do you know what, Pierre? -What? -I loved you from the first day. -And I you. You were so unlike the others. Carry on wooing me. Later. Let's have lunch now. There must be some cookies over here. Unless my friends ate them. Your friends take up a lot of room in your life. But now there's only you. -Forever? -Forever. Forever. You're very young to be saying that. What about you? Aren't you young? You're 20 this morning. 20 years old? I never had time to be that age. With me you'll find time. Here are the 100 francs you lent me yesterday, Nathalie. Thanks, I'd completely forgotten. -Hello. -Hello. Olivier, I need to speak to you. -What do you want? -The same as you? One more Martini, please. Listen, do you like me? No. I love you. Are you in trouble? No, on the contrary. That means I'm going to be in trouble. Is there someone? Yes, someone. Has it been long? No, it's recent. Is it one of our friends? No, he's a man who is about 40. Well done. Obviously, you… You don't hang around. I didn't realize you were like that. I know I'm hurting your feelings. I don't get it myself. Oh please! -Hey you two. How's it going? -Couldn't be better. Deep down, I was deluded. I think I dreamed it. Excuse me, I'd rather go. Olivier, please don't blame me. I love you too much for that. Goodbye. See you soon. -Vaden, where did you put the letter? -Sir, I'm sure I gave it to you. -It would be here if you had. -Excuse me. Here it is. -What's wrong with me? -You're a bit overworked. Hello? Who's speaking? Nathalie Neuville. Hello. I'll hand him over. Miss Neuville. Hello? Am I disturbing you? Can you talk? I miss you. I feel like I've not seen you for a century. A century? Centuries. Didn't you count? Six hours at least. Being separated like this is inhuman. Yes. Are we still having dinner together? I'm desperate but I can't get away. We can see each other afterwards. I'm working afterwards. Let's have lunch tomorrow then. -Tomorrow? -Yes, I'll pick you up. I love you. Yes, I love you. -Hello! -Hello! -Is ma'am well? -Wonderfully so. -It's true you're fab. -As promised, I learned your tastes. -Help me. -Where are we going? -Nowhere, look. -What's all this? -Did you clean out a store? -Yes, the grocer's. I'm sick of eating in restaurants. We always have to be careful, we can't kiss when we want. So we're having lunch here today. Like lovers. Yes, we are lovers, but me and cooking… It doesn't matter. If you've got a can opener, we'll be fine. I don't know why I'm telling you this. I'm not hungry. Yes. I'm hungry for you. Oh Pierre. I love you. It's so easy being-- -Miss Neuville? -Yes, speaking. -This is Vaden. -Hello. Is Mr. Montaud there? Yes, he's here. Let me hand him over. Here, it's for you. For me? Hello? Yes? Yes. And? Vaden, that's ridiculous. The meeting was scheduled for tomorrow. You can just tell the prosecutor… Okay, I'll go. I'll be there right away. I've had enough! It's a shame more than anything. Listen. -I'll pack them off and be back at 3 p.m. -Yes, but I won't be here. -Where are you going? -To the library. -When will you be back? -Around 6 p.m. Will you be free? No, it won't be possible. I have a client then. It's just that I'll then go to the club. Listen, don't be sad. Patience. I need to organize myself but then I swear it will all be fine. Yes, I believe you, Pierre. COURTHOUSE Forgive me. Did I keep you waiting? I know you didn't do it on purpose but it felt like I waited a long time. You're adorable. What did you do? Nothing. I went for a stroll. I did some window shopping. If you want something, now's the time. I always want something. But it's never the right time. Tell me. I wish we could spend more time together. Me too. You know that. For me, nice days can be counted by the hour. What's wrong? Are you tired? Nothing, it's nothing. I've not seen you smile yet this morning. What can I do to make you happy? Tell me. Wait. Here. -May I? -Thanks. Is this okay? Here. -Here, wait. -Oh no. -Yes, here. -No. -It's too much, Pierre. -Thanks, ma'am. There. Darling, what are you doing? I'm sunbathing. You should do the same, you're so pale. You know that I can't stand the sun. Oh yes you can, you can stand anything. What's up with you this morning? Aren't you happy? Isn't it great since we've been here? -Yes precisely. -What do you mean? -It's the way I am. -Explain what you mean. I never want to live in the present. You're here. It's sunny. There's the sea. Today is wonderful. So let's make the most of it. Impossible. I'm already thinking about tomorrow. And tomorrow… -Tomorrow what? -Everything will go back to normal. Waiting. Seeing each other in secret. Always hoping to grab an hour together. -Darling, I… -Oh I know. You've got your clients, your wife. My wife. Even before you I didn't love her anymore. I knew it but I didn't want to hurt her, I didn't want a violent break-up. Pierre. I didn't ask you to do anything. It's okay to reproach you. You don't have enough plans. I dream. You never dream. What do you know? Dream out loud to prove it to me. Am I in your dreams? Am I with you all the time? Yes, all the time. There are large log fires, an old house in the countryside. We meet there after I've been at the hospital and you in court. It has a large wall round it and a huge park we walk in. With dogs? Yes, a whole bunch of dogs that run ahead of us. Why not? It may happen sooner than we think. Do you think so? For now, I'm only asking not to be always so dependent on phone calls. To see you more. Two weeks, one week. -And I know where! -Where? On Chios in Greece. I was there two years ago. Alone? Worse, with six friends. But places like that are wasted when you're not with someone you love. I'd really love to go back there with you. Fine. For a vacation, I promise. Oh Pierre. I adore you. -Vaden. -Yes ma'am. -Is my husband alone? -Yes ma'am. -Is something wrong? -No ma'am, everything is perfect. I love being called incompetent and hearing I'll vegetate all my life. What now? -Sorry. -Don't say sorry. I'm used to it. Used to what? Your nervousness. You aren't married to Vaden. If you aren't careful you'll end up alone. So much the better. He's an idiot that mixes everything up. It's your business. Remember to dress for dinner. Where are we eating, again? Here. 12, including the Bar president. Is it not enough seeing them in court? Must I also see them at my table? You asked me to invite them. Yes, it's true. I'm sorry. Again. It's crazy how much you're apologizing at the moment. Honestly, Pierre. -What's wrong? -Nothing. I'm very well. Why are you looking at me like that? A month of vacation and I'll be fine. You'll be pleased. We board in Athens on the 27th July for a month. I've organized it all. -Organized what? -The vacation. What do you mean? Last year we talked about going on a cruise in Greece. -This year I booked a yacht. -Why are you nosing in? Booking a yacht. -You can cancel the booking. -Why? Got other plans? I'm going to get changed. And in Greece to boot! Oh that's just perfect! I knew something had to give. You think I'm a coward, don't you? So when do you leave? You didn't answer. A married man has to know where he stands. I swear I didn't know about it. It doesn't make a difference. When do you leave? At the end of the week. You see, Pierre. Women are like kids. You shouldn't make them promises you can't keep. -You're not free either. -What? It's true. You're at the hospital in the daytime and the club at night. -I need the club to support myself. -Quit. So that you can keep me? No, Pierre. That's not the life I want. Fine. I won't go. Yes, you'll go. You'll go since it's been decided. What are you going to do? I'll work. Listen. All this will come to an end. Remember Nice? And your dream? It will come true. I'll talk to my wife. At first we'll live together discreetly. You know what the town is like. It will be hard, but trust me. I swear it will all be sorted by the end of the year. What? -I'm going to do a placement in London. -You'll learn English. And you? I'm broke. I found a cover in the countryside. I got a job at a summer camp in Cannes. Lucky you. You did well. Hello. It's been a while since we met. You don't come to the club anymore. I no longer have much of a reason to go. What are you doing here? I came to see a worker who had an accident on the construction site. Are you going on vacation? Yes, my parents hired a house with a boat in Greece. It's crazy. Everyone is going to Greece this year. I'd have asked you to come, but I'm sure you've got very nice plans of your own. Yes. Very nice. Of course. Have a great vacation. You too. Thanks. Have fun. -Oh hello. -Hello. Sorry. I'm just the loyal employee. I was looking for you. Before leaving, I was asked to give you something. -What? -It's a nice surprise. As it's a bit bulky, I need you to follow me. There. Is it for me? It's wonderful. One was right to presume it would soften the blow of being separated. Too true. Here are the keys. I'll show you the papers. The tax disk, the registration document, the insurance and the release voucher. Now I'm at your service to show you the gears. No, like this. Third gear. There. It will be useful for vacation. I'm staying here so… Like me. I have to stand in for the boss to take care of day-to-day matters. No. This is first gear. This town is deadly quiet in August. Why don't we meet in the evening from time to time? Two poor abandoned creatures. By the same man. -My dear little Vaden… -I'm sick of being called that. My big Vaden, I'm not a day-to-day matter. So don't try to stand in for the boss. Still friends? Why not. By the way, I never thanked you. You introduced us. TOBACCONIST Sir. Don't come out. My wife is in the car. -What? -Yes. She insisted on coming Christmas shopping with me. That's normal. Yes it's normal. Try to be understanding. I couldn't say no. Of course. Run away. I said I was buying cigarettes. -Are you angry? -No. I know you're blaming me. I'm as miserable as you. Will you be at the club on Christmas Eve? Yes. And you'll be with your family. I have no choice. I'll do my best for New Year's Eve. -Although, if I… -If you can't leave, I'll understand. Go Pierre. I just want you to remember that the end of the year is coming. Yes, I know. I will call you tomorrow morning. -Pierre, your cigarettes. -What? Oh yes. A pack of Gitanes, please. See you tomorrow. -Good evening. -Good evening. Come. Let's dance. I really wanted to celebrate Christmas Eve with you but I couldn't leave. You know what families are like. I'm sure you'll forgive me. I've got a surprise for you. A very nice surprise. Tell me. Hug me close. Happy New Year. A happy new year to you. To us. Say. Say it quick. To feel you so close and not be able to kiss you. I can tell you now. I'd made a resolution for if you had forgotten… Me forget? I'd have done anything to see you tonight, if only for a minute. Pierre. The surprise. -What is it? -Come with me. Here. -Are you not happy? -Yes it's very pretty but I thought… I wasn't expecting that. I must go. I need to be back for midnight. Forgive me. Are you not wearing your ring? I'm not used to wearing them. Don't you like it? Would you have preferred something else? What could I have possibly wanted? I don't want anything more, thanks. Nor I. We'll be back at yours sooner. -Waiter! -We won't go back to mine. We'll never go back to mine together. It's over, Pierre. We're over. Is this a stupid joke or what? No. Let me talk. Don't interrupt me. It's not easy, you know. I've had enough of the secrecy and the little lies. What you promised me was impossible. When you make a promise, you're sincere. It's not your fault if you break it. When I promise what? I don't understand. It's incredible. I've got a hard life too, you know. I've not been myself for months. I'm not sure if you're destroying me or if I'm destroying myself. All this deceit. I'm done with it. Be honest. Say you don't love me anymore. Whether I love you or suffer or not is my problem -I solve my own problems alone. -Am I not important? It's handy, isn't it? Do you not think it's a bit too handy? -Be quiet. People are listening. -Let them listen. I don't care. Do you think it's going to end like this just because you decided it? You don't care how I feel. You don't know what I'm capable of. You're hurting me, Pierre. We're ridiculous. Ridicule is the only thing that affects you. -Calm down. Let's leave. -Yes, I am ridiculous. And them? Aren't they all ridiculous? Look at them. So much the better if they hear. So much the better if it's entertaining and stops them… What's going on Mr. Montaud? Please calm down. Come on! Sir. -Yes? -Mrs. Durieux. She had an appointment at seven, it's almost eight. I won't see anyone else today. -But it's very important. -Leave me alone. Can I say that you've been taken ill? Incidentally, there were several calls for you. -Who? -People who were eating in the same restaurant as you. Did you faint? Get out. Right now! Is that a definitive dismissal? -Yes, if you want. -Very well. -Excuse me sir. -What now? I need a new checkbook. Look in the drawer. Suzanne. Does my wife know? Did someone call her? Not yet. This happened because I tried to spare her. How stupid. Have you found it? No sir. It's not in the drawer. Are you scared of me now? Don't you think there's been enough scandal? -Can't you grant me five minutes? -I have no more to say to you. I do. You're going to make more promises. No Pierre. It's over. I'm asking you. Five minutes. We'll stay in the car. I followed you when you left the restaurant. Is it because of him? -No it's not because of him. -Who is it then? -Let me out. -Who is it? A friend. He's got one quality, at least. He's there for me. I can go out with him, be seen with him, laugh. I can laugh in public. Together we can make plans. -We'll make plans too. -No I don't believe you anymore. -Don't leave me. I need you. -You. Always you. What about what I want? I never got the little I wanted. Don't leave me, please. I love you. You changed me as a man. You can't abandon me. We can start afresh. It will all work out. You're too much of a coward, an egotist. That's why I want to forget you in the arms of that boy. Shut up. I'll join him. Tonight or tomorrow. -Shut up! -If not him it'll be another and then another until you're not even a memory anymore. Shut up! Do that and I swear I'll use it. Pull the trigger then. What are you waiting for? Shoot! You're not even brave enough to do that. Afterwards, I drove around at random and then I went home. Do you still maintain that you put the revolver back in the drawer? Absolutely, yes. And you claim you never took it out again? I don't claim it. I can affirm it. How do you explain the fact it was found on the crime scene? Your Honor, I don't know any more than you. Can you explain why your fingerprints were found on the Lacat's railings? Since you deny having been there on the night of the crime. There's no point in denying it. I went there that evening. I called Miss Neuville. It was her night off. She didn't answer. I presumed she was with him. So I went there. And? Lacat came out of the house, he crossed the yard, he went to get something from his car. And then… -He went back in. I left. -Where? -On the road. I drove. -More? Sometimes one just drives without realizing it, Your Honor. -You can't imagine. -Indeed. I don't know those kind of circumstances very well. Me neither, Your Honor. Does my statement match Miss Neuville's? Entirely, sir. The weapon is yours, the fingerprints at the scene are yours. To my great regret, I'm going to have to… -Arrest me? -If you were me, you'd do the same. This is insane. I'm not guilty! Think of the consequences, the scandal! You should have thought of that before. I get your point of view. -But the law is the same for all. -Sir, may I? The same goes for legal formalities. ONE OF THE TOWN'S LEADING LAWYERS IS CHARGED WITH MURDER Sudden turn of events in the Montaud case, in a special edition of France-Soir. SUDDEN TURN OF EVENTS IN THE MONTAUD CASE. AN UNFORESEEN DEVELOPMENT. This is where someone might have broken into the house to take the revolver. We owe this discovery to Miss Suzanne Marvel. It may mean the Montaud case goes differently. Miss, how long have you been Mr. Montaud's secretary? More than 12 years. What do you think of him? He's a remarkable man. He's incapable of doing what he's been accused of. Right. How did you notice that the transom window was broken? I felt a draft while looking for a file. The prosecution claims that it's a smokescreen which you put up to make the jury doubt what happened. Pierre, was it you? At the time, I'd never have been able to imagine something like that. Yes, it's true. You were overworked and anxious. You even saw a doctor. I get it. You want to plead illness and diminished responsibility. It's out of the question. I didn't kill him. I didn't take the revolver. You need to believe me. If not as a friend, as my lawyer. I believe you. You seem much better. More lucid, calmer. I must have needed a rest cure like this. -Have you seen her? -No. She's still in town, still at the club. -And Hélène? -She's got a lot of dignity. -Has she been to see you? -No. Suzanne keeps me updated. She told me that Vaden hasn't left. He must be making so many mistakes. -Right. My file. -Here it is. It's not great, I know. -My colleagues must have been pleased. -It's only human. They don't know what's about to hit them. They took all my clients. See what I do with theirs when I'm out. Yes, of course. At this very moment, the jury is deciding on the fate of the lawyer Pierre Montaud whose trial has divided opinion. As soon as we know the verdict… Acquitted. COUNTY JAIL Thanks, old friend. -I'm happy to see you Vaden. -Likewise, sir, believe me. Come. My car is there. Sir! It's for the radio. -You were in jail 14 months and 17 days. -14 months less 17 days. More than enough. -What are your plans? -To go back to my legal firm. -Don't you fear… -Fear of what? the magistrates will be angry? -Because I was acquitted? -There was a crime. -And? -Who's the culprit? Listen, I've been acquitted. I'm no longer at risk. Rest assured, I'm innocent. So the culprit is still running free? -That's quite obvious to me. -Do you suspect anyone? -I'm unsure if suspicions are worth much. -Will you try to find him? -That's for the police. -Talking of the police. Do you think they jumped to a conclusion? -We usually blame them for the opposite. -It's also been said that there is hostility towards you. I hope you aren't calling into question the independence and integrity of the judicial authorities. Certainly not but is there anything you'd like to add? The examining magistrate asked me that, and I replied no. My reply is no. The one thing I can say is that I am innocent. And I want my place in society back. The one I held previously. Sir, a word on love matters for my newspaper The Eternal Feminine. Ma'am, experience has proven that I wasn't ever able to solve those issues. -You were brilliant. -I'd have been more so if I was sincere. What I endured belongs to me, I don't want the crowds to lament my fate. Only the future matters to me now. What's the word about my acquittal? You got off lightly, asshole. We'll kill you! There's the answer. -They must be Olivier Lacat's friends. -And the others? -Some say it's justice. -Yes, but the others? That there's honor among thieves. That you had a good lawyer. The crowd welcomed your arrest, of course. A successful man was being brought down. Now people think your acquittal is a kind of conspiracy, some kind of legal scheming. And the people in my close circle? -You can ask them. You'll see. -I'm asking you. -I got your acquittal, didn't I? -That's not an answer. And the public doesn't even cut me some slack. Sir! I'm so happy. Thanks, Suzanne. Don't be moved. Are you alone? Mrs. Montaud left the house this afternoon. When the verdict was announced. The house and the town. Of course. I got them to prepare you a light dinner. Thanks, I'm not hungry. I also took the liberty of putting champagne on to chill. I'm very touched, Suzanne, but I would like to be alone. I understand, sir. I'll go. Wait, I'll get it. Give it to me. We'll get you anyway. You'll get what you deserve. Insults. It's non-stop. Goodnight. Thanks for the champagne. I promise I'll have some. Goodnight sir. Hello, Mr. Montaud? Justice is for only for others, is it? Don't worry, we'll deal with you. -Look who's coming. -Damn, he's got nerve! -Don't let him in. -No. -Good evening. -Do you have the new membership card? -The new card? -Obviously. Montaud wants to come in here. I swear I will find a way in. Leave him to me. Do you want to shoot him down too? Bastard, did you know Lacat was my friend? Stop. Please. You're mad. Go downstairs. Jérôme, do it for me. You always wriggle out of everything, you bastard. Let's go. This place is starting to disgust me. Here. Here are the keys. Take them. Go home. I'll meet you there right away. -Pierre? -Yes? It's daybreak. Our first day of freedom. It's wonderful, don't you think? All the lies and the deceit are over… I've waited so long to hear those words. I must have made you very unhappy. I didn't realize, you know. I had time to think in jail. I understood many things. -Do you forgive me? -It's in the past. It's ended well. Now we can try to be happy. Let's not talk about anything. Not today. -Do you feel moved? -No but it's a weird feeling. I'll go park the car and then I'll join in the lion's den. -Good luck. -I've got plenty to spare. Come on Vaden. You'll go see the court clerk about the Marchand divorce. Don't make the same mistake. If I consider how many mistakes I made, I almost brought down the firm. You're young, Vaden. You can't know everything. Anyway, I wanted to thank you for your ardor. It's weird, when you used to make a comment it felt less insulting. -Vaden, did you enjoy being the boss? -Er. I'm sorry to have to take my place from you again. -Hello. -What a surprise. It's been a while. Much too long, if you want my opinion. Excuse me, ma'am. That's is Mr. Montaud. Is he the one that killed the young man? See you later, sir. Hello. Well I never. Montaud is here. -I'm still your colleague. -I do hope so. Montaud, it's a pleasure to see you among us again. Thanks. It doesn't seem to be the general opinion. You're a dangerous rival. Your return has caused a lot of panic. Your clients had been divvied up. How did my dear colleagues do it? Did they roll the dice? They played bridge. It's more refined. They aren't being hostile. They just feel a bit awkward. Maybe because of what they said. Especially as you were the most innocent of guilty people. Or the most guilty of innocent people. Did it not occur to anyone that I am the most innocent of innocents? -Hello gentlemen. -Hello. Are you scared of ghosts? -No. We're used to the sound of chains. -Sorry, I didn't keep mine on. You had an excellent lawyer, Montaud. Admit that I had a good case. How is your wife? She really deserved this joy. Me too. Look to your left. -Hello gentlemen. -Hello. Wha… This is a provocation. Your presence here is improper. They've been saying that about yours for 50 years, dear sir. -I was never convicted. -No. You were just despised by honest people. And hated by the people you helped to rob. You also seem to forget that I was acquitted. Based on the benefit of the doubt. -Some benefits are unlawful. -Like those with your post-war clients? A decent court would have sentenced you. Courts like the ones you frequented -during the Occupation no longer exist. -That's enough. Even though it meant being condemned to death, that was seen as an honor back then. How can you speak of honor? You whose name has been linked to all the worst places of this town. Would it have been better to have been associated with the Parisian clubs where I might have crossed paths with you? For the first time ever you're making people laugh. After all, it is an open secret. We'd been lying in wait for each other for so long. -You don't seem to agree. -What do you gain from it? He won't wrongly accuse me anymore. -Montaud. -Yes? Congratulations, dear friend, you experienced great injustice but you affirmed your legitimate rights. Thanks to reasonable doubt. See you later. The file for the Millet case? Yes, of course I have it. But I don't know if I can share it with you. Why? Given the circumstances. What are you talking about? What everyone is talking about. The war in the Far East? Did you know you were breaching the rules? -Dear Sir, I'm pleased to see you. -I hope this wasn't your order Your Honor. Your subordinate is refusing to give me my client's file. Let's chat in my office. You got a case very quickly. My firm was in auto-pilot mode. My associate was in charge. You're going to take a vacation, I'm sure? -I've just had a very long one. -Not in the great outdoors though. I am grateful for your concern. Do you advise me to distance myself? Give the magistrates time to get used to the idea… …of my acquittal? In their eyes, for a criminal court judgment to be valid it must basically be a conviction. It's not that simple. I know it's an injustice. They are trying to use it to topple me. I hope that the governing board is going to take a look at my case. On what basis? You know as well as I do what case files are. You can find your answer in them. You may just need to reorder them. You've got a very poor opinion of us all. Do you honestly not have the same opinion, Your Honor? If only the police would try harder to find the culprit! Do you think I'm funny? Must acquittal by reasonable doubt mean an unpunished crook? Do you mean to say we never look for a second truth when the first is wrong? It's strange. You're a famous, shrewd lawyer but you're very naïve. Don't stir things up. Don't rekindle the scandal. I'm happy you were acquitted. I'm happy to see you among us again. And the file? Take it, since you're refusing my advice. The swines. -They'll make me regret jail. -Surely. They will never forgive me for having been acquitted. Never. What did they say about my row with the Bar president? You won on points. Scathing retorts, with composure and some insolence. -And what about the rest? -I can sum it up in a sentence. A nice exit, provided it really was his farewell ceremony. I've been advised to leave, which means they think I'm guilty. Let's just say they aren't convinced you're innocent. And you? You thought I was guilty too. -No. -Did you never doubt it? Even when they found my gun on the crime scene? You don't dare say it. To be truthful, I don't know. Remember when you refused to let me plead diminished responsibility? -I was right. -Technically, yes. -What? Do you claim… -I don't claim anything. I just wondered… -Sometimes, I still wonder. -Stop. Let me get out. I've heard enough of this trash today. Don't be stupid. You asked me a question, I replied. You were in a strange state at the time of the crime. Do you remember the day when we were waiting for you at the court and you were found sitting on a bench, dazed. No, badly. And the scandal with Nathalie at the restaurant? It's as if another person experienced it. Maybe, but the restaurant owner and ten witnesses testified. I'm not saying you killed, I'm just saying you could have killed. It's a hypothesis. I hadn't envisaged it. Why did you take the revolver? Why did you threaten Nathalie with it? It was partly just acting. I didn't know what I was doing. I was like a madman. Forget it all. Start over. Don't let the past trouble you. Think, if that past is going to affect my future. -Shall I take you home? -No. I'm not going home. Stop here. For three hours, I wouldn't have known what I was doing. I would have gone there, killed him and left. Do you think that's possible? I don't know, Pierre. Does it not seem inconceivable to you? Answer! You thought me guilty too. At the beginning, maybe. I don't know. I don't know anymore. I was half mad, wasn't I? -It's like you want to hurt yourself. -I must know, do you see? We're together and we're happy. I want to forget about it. Do the same. You've not had to put up with the things I've been hearing for months. I thought it was over, but no. This afternoon again. Yes it's true. I want to know if it was me. I know I'm no longer at risk because I was acquitted. They are right. I won't fight anymore. If you want, we can leave. But if I could know it wasn't me, I… What would you do? I think I would be ruthless. My memories are confused. Didn't you think I was different then? Nothing odd? You were drinking a lot. You had lapses and loss of memory. You blamed me for everything. I didn't even know if you loved me or if I bothered you. I was like a crazy person too when I split up with you. I wasn't myself either. It was like I was watching someone else. It wasn't someone I knew. It was someone who hated you and wanted to hurt you at all cost to get revenge for loving you. The scene in the car outside the club, the whole thing with Olivier Lacat, it was all to push you to the limit. When you were arrested, I wanted to take the blame. At the same time, I was happy that you were suffering. Is that why you said I threatened you with the gun? Probably, yes. It's strange how one can love someone to death and behave like I did. I had given you reason to do so. No. Would those reasons have counted if had I really loved you? If I'd loved you like I love you now, selflessly. So much suffering for us to finally be together. Listen. I've had enough of being trailed. You can tell your boss on my behalf. He'd be better off looking for the real culprit because I'll find him. Scandal or not. MAGISTRATES' COURT Don't worry, ma'am. The magistrates are on our side. That's not the impression I get. I know you've got a lot of merit, sir. -But I fear I might have to… -Give the case to someone else? The case has been dragging on. When I came to you with it, you hadn't killed anyone yet. Hello my dear Vaden. Hello Mr. Prosecutor. Is your sister OK? I haven't seen her for ages. Very well, thanks. You'll send her my regards. I'm fond of her. That's why I'd like to tell you, that you've got a lot of merit and that it's good for trainees to occasionally change law firms. I mean… to adopt other methods. Do you understand? He understands you very well. Well, well. -Hello. -No. It's "Hello sir." -I've not been disbarred yet. -You should have been. If only for having been in the position of having to be judged. -Even innocent? -Even innocent. If you came to court more often you'd know me better. Come now Montaud. For your sake and ours, allow yourself to be forgotten. I understand your point of view, but I plan on doing the opposite. -Perfect. -Let's go, Vaden. -About what he said. Don't think that… -I don't think anything and I don't care. Tell me, Vaden. Be honest for once, if you can. -How was I in the run up to… -Do you not remember anything? You were different, even in your way of working. Without enthusiasm, without talent even. You acted as though you were sleepwalking. Strange behavior and incomprehensible actions. You can't be insinuating that I could have killed in that state? I'm not insinuating anything. I'm being honest. So you think it possible? We've seen similar cases. You defended one, don't you remember? Yes. I need to reread the report that the expert wrote on me. We'll review the case and redo the inquiry on the crime, the people involved and me. There's no point. -It was done already. -Yes, but badly. The entire case rested on Mr. Montaud being guilty a priori. -Right? -Yes but that's always the case. You've been acquitted so don't stir it up again. In short, no one wants me to fight for the truth. My friends don't want it, nor my colleagues or the magistrates. No, that's not quite true. You're playing the role of victim of a miscarriage of justice but you weren't even convicted. Don't reopen the case, sir. I knew Lacat, he didn't have any enemies. The police searched everywhere, you won't find anything more. If you don't find the culprit, you only risk one thing. You risk losing all credibility in the eyes of public opinion. For the time being, you're admired with a level of complicit leniency. Yes, they see you as being guilty but you're shrewd and they like that. Tell yourself you weren't acting normally. It's therefore diminished responsibility. Which is what you all think. I'm far from convinced. Most of the time, psychiatrists' reports are trash. The expert assessments and second opinions are never in agreement. No sir. Believe me. I've seen all kinds of cases but three hours of total amnesia is rare. There might be exceptions, but only in cases where the subject is quite flawed. The way I see it, you think I'm fully responsible. That deduction is maybe a bit simplistic, don't you think? Does that mean the police think I'm innocent? The police force is composed of officers and each officer has their own opinion and their own doubts. Do you want to file a complaint against the young people at the club? At their age, if I'd have run into the man accused of killing my friend, I think I'd have done the same. Yes, I suspected as much. It's just a routine procedure. Is it also because of routine that you're having me tailed? Had you forgotten I was acquitted? Is that why I'm being tailed? Since you're not guilty, the culprit is roaming free. Who knows, maybe you'll lead us to him. Believe me, if I knew him… I'd know about it. My detective has told me about your intentions so I wish you good luck. For months now, we haven't found anything more than you know already. And excuse the language, but you would have been screwed without the miraculous discovery of the broken transom window. It's the only piece of evidence that was in your favor. -Tell me once you've found the culprit. -You can count on me. -Goodbye Captain. -Goodbye sir. I understand nothing anymore. The evidence which proved my innocence was falsified. I'd like to know who falsified it. Suzanne. If you did it, you must have thought me guilty too. Yes, at first. I couldn't stand seeing you in jail. I know. Thank you. In short, I owe you my life or nearly. If no one broke in to take the gun, it must have been someone from this house. But who? And for what reason? You? No. It can't have been the maid. There's no way it was my wife. Even if it were her, she'd have shot me or Nathalie, not Lacat. But… How did Vaden behave while I was in prison? Do you think that… He's the only person left. But why? There was no motive for him. Unless… COLLEGE LIBRARY Why did you come here? Don't be ashamed. Soon they'll apologize for their words or thoughts. I've not got my car. Do you have yours? Yes, it's this way. -I've known Vaden for a long time, why? -Did you see each other often? Yes, sometimes. -You're not jealous of Vaden are you? -Listen, it's very important. I've got good reasons to believe he killed Lacat. Let me talk. I've not found his motive yet… Was there ever anything between you? Was he in love with you? -Not that I'm aware of. -Nothing? Once, vaguely, but he didn't insist. -Are you sure of what you're saying? -It would be too long to explain. Only he could have taken the gun. I'm sure. Even if it wasn't him, he knows he used it. I'll get him to admit it. I'll find out who the bastard is. Most likely Pierre. When I think that that bastard caused me to rot in prison for months instead of him. I experienced the worst humiliation in his place. Since being freed, I've been called a murderer and a madman, even by you. Believe me, when I find that bastard I'll make him pay 100 times over. What's wrong with you? I was thinking of you in jail, of everything you just said. I knew you were suffering, of course, but I didn't imagine to what extent. Now I understand. I understand. Don't cry. Soon I'll prove my innocence. We'll be happy. Don't you believe me? Don't you believe we'll be happy? What's wrong? Are you cold? -Yes a bit. -Listen. I'll make that slob confess everything and then I'll join you at the club. Kiss me. Hug me tight. I'm so cold. Pierre. -The surprise. What is it? -Come with me. Aren't you happy? Yes it's very pretty but… I wasn't expecting this. I need to go. I need to be home for midnight. Yes, it's only me. Are you alone? Yes, alone. Really alone. It's funny, isn't it? I've never seen anything so funny. Lights! Do you not have anyone to kiss? -Can I ask you… -No, I'm asking you. -Is it because of him? -No it's not because of him. You've turned me into another man. You can't leave me. I want to forget all about you in the arms of that boy. Tonight or tomorrow, until you're not even a memory anymore. Shut up! If you do that, I swear I'll use this. Shoot me. Go on, shoot me. What are you shooting for? -You? -I really need to speak to you. Follow me. You're mad to have come here. I waited until I saw the secretary go. Then I saw Pierre and his wife leave. Come in. Do you know where he hides his revolver? In the first drawer of his desk I believe. What are you doing? He didn't keep it on him. You're not taking it. In the state he's in, he'd be capable of anything. Even of killing himself. Ever since knowing you, I've hoped for an evening like this. How long has it been? I don't know. Two or three years? I had fantasized about us. Each time you came here as a friend, I told myself that one day it would be different and that you'd be here as my Nathalie. But you abandoned your friends… It doesn't matter now. You're here. -Can you give me another drink? -I think we're drinking too much. Especially you. Come on. Come closer to me. You're even more beautiful like this. You were the one who wanted to come here. That's the most wonderful part. I had come to believe it would never happen, Nathalie I thought you were too far away. Then you gave me a signal. That happiness makes my head spin even more so than whisky does. I'd like to not wake up. No. Don't touch me! You don't understand. I cannot! I thought I was stronger. Get out. Listen, Olivier. Shut up! Go away. Hurry up! Olivier, I didn't want to hurt you. And now you're making a fool of me too? Get out. Do you hear? Get out. I was beastly with you. I shouldn't have been. What's the point? That's too easy a way out. -You were making a fool of me, right? -No. I swear. -Do I disgust you? -No Olivier. You're having a laugh at my expense, in that case. You always have done. I didn't come to find you. Why did you do that? To humiliate me? I thought that I would be able to. I thought I wanted to but it's impossible. Not you, not another. Never! So that's it. Don't beat yourself up about your Montaud, he doesn't have long. I won't see him again. I hate him. -He's the one that doesn't want you! -Shut up, leave me! Your love story with the lawyer is beautiful. It was worth abandoning everyone for it, starting with me. We all know about middle-class whims. What were you entitled to? Crumbs and promises. I bet he was going to leave his wife for you. And you believed him. But everyone knows that you were just an extra, stupid fool. You were the dumping grounds for his romantic whims on Saturday nights. That's what you chose. He didn't hurry to chose you. I'm the biggest fool in all of this. None of this is for me, it's against him. You decided you'd cheat if he left you. Shut up! You might as well have chosen another. Another person who didn't love you. You weren't even brave enough to go through with it, even with whisky shots. Am I right or not? Bitch! I'm not a guy one can't sleep with, even if it's out of vengeance. You're just a nasty lost soul. A nasty little bitch! And Montaud wins, as always. Right now, he's with his wife. He's holding her, she's holding him. She won't let him go. But you're alone. You're nothing. You'll never be anything. I didn't know what I was doing. I pulled the trigger. I was in the dark, like in a nightmare. Calm down. Did anyone see you? No, I don't think so. We were alone. Vaden, what should I do? First, don't move. Where's the gun? I left it there. They will find it. It's Pierre's one. I'll go fetch it. No, stay where you are. I'll go. I'll call you tomorrow. But… THE ARREST OF MR. MONTAUD THE GUN BELONGED TO THE FAMOUS LAWYER That's right. I offered to go get the gun. But I refrained from doing it. Did you know what would happen? Obviously. That's vile! No. He needed rest. He'll get some. He'll leave you alone. I'll gain clients. -It's win-win for everyone. -Bastard. That's easy to say. Who is a bastard and who isn't? What means did he use to become universally respected? What means did he use to keep you? I would hear him call you. On this day we'll do this. On this day we'll do that. Except his schedule was already full, with dinners with his wife, with little trips with his wife, with vacations with his wife. Where are you going? To hand myself in. Good idea. Do you know the sentence? It won't be anything less than 20 years. For the illustrious Montaud it would less expensive. Infinitely so. If not free. You wouldn't have to wait long for him. I don't know what happened. I was holding the gun… I know. You didn't pull the trigger, your hand did. I've heard that already. The judges too. They never believe it. They say it's not a valid excuse. There's nothing you can do, kid. I killed him, I need to pay for it. I won't let Pierre be convicted. He won't ever be. Your life will be ruined, not his. What does he risk? A few months behind bars, nothing more. And if he is convicted, it won't be too late to admit you did it. He won't be convicted though. There's honor among thieves. Another man might have been. But not him. I'm sure he'll be acquitted. Do you hear me? -Acquitted? -Yes. Acquitted. DIVERSION I'd be happy to believe it's not you, but you'll pay for letting me rot in jail. Now tell me who killed Lacat. Who? Hello? Speaking. I'm coming. Yes. Nathalie's car hit a train. Unless she drove it at the train. It was the only solution. Why are you so upset? Do you feel that responsible? Shall I take you home? No, it's fine. I can drive. Thanks. Don't search any longer. I'm the culprit. Yes, maybe. THE END Subtitle translation by: Ginger Clark
