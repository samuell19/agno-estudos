The SLOVAK FILM INSTITUTE presents THE BOXER AND DEATH Screenplay: Music: Production Designer: Edited by: Sound: Cast: Executive Producer: Director of Photography: Directed by: Made by the Bratislava Film Studios You were fantastic. Fantastic... Fantastic training. You can't complain! No other boxer has such opportunities. Opportunities? They are but flies! They're better than nothing. Train with them. You'll keep yourself in trim. My manager is really naive too. He asks me if I train hard. That's just like you. Be glad he's counting on you! You'll get back in the ring and regain your good name. The only thing that matters. If it was that simple... Will it take long? No. - Nine escaped? - Three of them were Jews. Do away with them! You wanted to say a few words. Right! Flies! You knew what would happen if you escaped. Life in the camp has its rules. You have broken them. You have played foul. Liquidate! The Commandant said it in plain words. There is nothing to add. For amoral people, for the enemies of the Reich, there are only two ways to freedom: Through the chimney and through work. You have chosen the first way. Yet, one must also be inwardly prepared for a fair death. Asshole! Always patronising me. You were in a hurry, you can wait until morning. Down! Up! Down! Up!... Faster! Down, you bastard! Quiet! Are you tired? That sort of escape is tiring, isn't it? How is that possible...? Psychologist! - A boxer? - Yes, sir. Welterweight? No. Middle? Cruiser. - You're lying. - No... I... looked different. Name? Amateur? Come! Stop staring! Get your clothes off! Come on! What's going on here? The Commandant's preparing a tragedy with a prisoner. It's a rehearsal for a comedy. I'm so delighted! Holder will be even more pleased. Really? All the better! What row would you like your tickets for, gentlemen? Unfortunately, I am both referee and timekeeper. And I am an objective audience. Here's the opponent! Willi, fasten his gloves! The first match without a penny. Finished! Referee! The Commandant won by K.O. in the first round. You're in great form! What sort of opponent was that! He fought for one minute and 35 seconds. It's a pity I didn't examine him before the match. Holder, he's yours now. Must you do that? Look how thin he is! What was there to expect from him? He's at least 15 kilos lighter than his original weight. I also am useless when I'm hungry. I can't even polish my boots. Though you're not trained, you stood up well. Do you think...? Willi, you feed him up! He needs to put on four kilos in three days. Four? Is that possible? Yes, it is. It could be interesting as an experiment. We'll try it again in three days. We'll see then what he's good for. Come here! What's the rush? All in good time. What was your weight? Get on the scales! Seventy-five. Eleven less now. Eat! That's all I needed! I have nothing but trouble with you. Do you like German food? Yet, you always complain, you gourmets! By the way, where are you from? - HÃ©jniky... - Is that in Europe? In Slovakia. Do you know a Gabika there? She lived in Pressburg. That's a pity. A great girl. I'd travel every month to see her. She used to dress really nicely. I don't know why I dumped her. It was the scent. I hated it. You wouldn't have thought that, would you? Right, enough! Get back on the scales! You'll overload your system, die in the pleasantest way but I'll have to pay for it. Such is life! There's no justice in the world. Kraft gets loads of money for half an hour's boxing. Do you also say loads? And what for? Any knife is better than the strongest blow. You ate almost a kilo. I'll fatten you up like a pig, don't worry. The Commandant must have something to beat. Have some of this and come for supper! - All right. - You must say: Yes, sir! - Yes, Sturmmann! - Mr. Willi! Up! Get up, man! Convict number 65... You're sleeping and neglecting your duties. You must think of them even while you're asleep. That's it. You won't put on four kilos in this way. Shall I eat instead of you? You live like a spa guest here. You have all the luck. Do not forget again! Attention! Kominek is in your block again. I understand. You understand shit! He mustn't be hurt at all! The Commandant wants you to leave the prisoner in peace. Since when do runaways get bread? It is not for free. I had a match with Kraft. He beat me. Did he? You don't say! Let him rot! I was beaten yesterday but they forgot the bread. I was a sack for him. What did you get the bread for? I say... Are they bothering you? To bed, you bastards! Kominek, do you hear? I really fought with Kraft. I can't stand it any longer. I still have three days. The others can have a rest after work. I have a match in three days, he may let me live. You're my friend, you can help me. You're well in with them. Get me some poison! Please, get it! Is that him? The morning walk. To Kraft's place. Bastard. Time? Two minutes ten. That's bad for you. First he'll play with you and then "circum dederum". Do you also say "circum dederum"? Rat! Go hang yourself! Swine! Aristocrat! Spy! I'm no spy! I box with Kraft! What do you want from me? Should I go to the gas chamber? I'm just trying to save my life just like you! Do you hear? Wait! Stance! Guard. Nowjab, clear... hook... side step... Cover! - A new Joe Louis. - Shit. The champion of narks. Cover! Gentlemen, having a good time? - Did he beat you? - No. Do you know how this work is paid? Let's say... with cigarettes. Let's say. I am Venilak. Men like me don't get a mention in the sports news. But I have all the good international boxers in this file. Venilak. Remember! Block 6. Kominek, did you bring it? Maybe you didn't believe me last night but I'm serious. Stop talking about poison. I can't bear it any longer. Who's the thief? Who stole my bread? Is it morning? Gannet! Selfish egoist! One, two, one, two...! Faster! Come on, you bastards! Faster! Gestapo... camp... transport. Not that. Something human. Nostalgia... sadness... anger... hatred... friend... Why did you call me? Baby... Sit down! Eat! Thanks. Sit down! Did he beat you much? I felt like in a threshing machine. I have never experienced anything like it in my life. It had nothing to do with boxing. He signals his punches, doesn't he? That was just like one big punch. - And then? - Nothing. Speak! Come on? When do you box with Kraft? The bread is for you only. When do you fight? - In two days. - Wow, two days! They are exercising. Have you trained today? I tried to. That wasn't a good idea. First you must get your strength up. When you look like a human you can fight again. We'll train a little tomorrow in the evening. He'll tear me to pieces. Take it easy, we're still alive. Are you given enough food? Eat then. Nutritious food. Meat, sugar. As for bread, be cautious. And don't think of the boxing. Were you the national team trainer? Just imagine, I wasn't. But in our club at Wola... it's a suburb of Warsaw... I was in charge of the hall and gloves... I saw a lot of good training. If this isn't enough... Not to train, you say? Not before the evening. All right. I'll come tomorrow. Do so. Don't worry, it'll be a good lesson. Down, up, down, up... Enough! - One night only, Venilak. - A little shadow boxing now. Punches with the left... right... left... right... hook... Right hook now, left, right... bobbing and a step aside. Enough, enough. It'll be better "przyszlosc". "Przyszlosc?" What comes later. - I see, next time. - Yes, next time. You have pretty good reflexes. But improve your cover. He will break through it with a single punch. When he hits you try to dodge. Step aside all the time... What would you like to do? To knock out Kraft? I wish I could... This isn't a stadium, convict! The factory in Dusseldorf wasn't a stadium either. But when the foreman said I was a Slovak bastard... That's why you're here! I escaped, got caught and shut in here. I ran away again. And you're in here again. Through no fault of my own. The others couldn't run. I wish I had one more chance! But I would leave on my own. Stop dreaming! Use your head! Kraft mustn't hit you tomorrow. When you're not able to go on, go down! What? Go down? You'll endure more than last time! I bet. But don't let him ruin you completely. - What's wrong with him? - He's losing his memory. He's lucky. Moss, grass... What's the use of it? Have you forgotten? Why do you escape then? When my hair began falling out we were promised a blitzkrieg. You seem to be in great shape. Do you doubt it? I thought you had a match today. You've got a nice leotard. You look like a human being. How much will you stand? One round? Man, what an idea! In Schlijssburg... have you been there? A cheap hotel but a perfect chambermaid. Kominek, help me. I'll bet ten marks on you. What do you say? How much did he gain? Well done, Willi! Well? Interesting. I hope the conditions are met. Preliminary round! Willi, you are an expert on human souls. Will you have some, Commandant? The sportsman does not drink. Cheers! Dear Holder, life is unpredictable. What about a toast to the opponent's health? Quite witty, Doctor. To your health! I am bursting with impatience. Sit down. We are about to finish. The Commandant forgot I was his trainer. I bet he will last one round. Two rounds. Helga, bet. Ten marks against a day off. What do you need a day off for? My aunt in Schlijssburg is ill. I haven't seen her since I was born. It's a deal. That's ten marks down the drain. Shall we bet too? Come on! What can you win here? Let's begin! Kraft is to attack! Left... right... missed! Another Kraft attack! Kominekjumped aside, Kraft loses his balance. Kominek could have made use of the situation. He hasn't. Strange! Kraft attacks enthusiastically, all his punches are misses, though. Perhaps he drank too much. The convict may have a more accurate eye. Who knows! This is broadcast of the Reich, Berlin! We are broadcasting the first round of the boxing match Kraft - Kominek. Kominek has just been hit! Willi, it's looking bad, my friend! Your poor aunt will stay alone tonight! Other punches hit Kominek! He defends himself by a clinch. Ladies and gentlemen, a rare sight! The Commandant and convict hugging like father and son! Break! Bell! Pause! Walter, you are fantastic! Get out! I don't need it. Lemonade, sweets, chocolate... Second round! Careful, Commandant! One, two, three... seven, eight... Box! Break! One, two, three, four... Get up! Five, six, seven, eight... You won the bet. You're making progress. My school, Commandant. It'll drive my aunt crazy! Why didn't you punch me when you could? You were... out of the ring. You tricked me three times by dodging aside. You won't succeed again. You gave him time in the clinch. Third round! One, two, three... eight, nine, ten. You won, Commandant! You were quite good but that last punch was not good. I know what it was like. May I examine the convict? Bring him back in good order! We have another match in three days. Of course! Shall we bet three rounds, madam? Your aunt again? Attention! Caps off! Stop! When did you have a wash? In the morning. Morning? I can't see. Take the shirt off! Nothing but dirt. Have a bath! Bath, I say! You're still dirty! Why didn't you kill him? That would be very simple. Seeing my weapon, he might laugh like a stupid villager seeing a camera. What should we do? Rehearse dying with the prisoners like on the stage? When speaking about the theatre... You've directed the operetta with Kominek for three months. The prisoners will soon send him flowers to the ring. A fine speech, Holder. There are conditions for that. - Do you know what they think? - No, I don't. That one of them is hitting back at us here in the camp. Jews, communists, all that mob raise their eyes. Do you think we are threatened? I only see the change of mood. The mood hasn't changed. The camp is quiet and peaceful. Well, what happened? - Kraft got it. - No! He doesn't use the peek-a-boo. Did he lower the left hand? I forgot everything. It is a perfect feeling not being frightened. I hit his chin, he raised his cover and I hit his stomach. Did he go down? I caught him in my arms. But if I'd done two more steps... If I want I can beat him very quickly. That's not true! It is, everybody saw it. But that is not true. Remember, that is not true. Kraft has to forget about your punch. The Commandant mustn't lose. I am better than him. Your life is at stake. I can't bear it any longer. Should I go to the gym as to a slaughterhouse? Well, what shall I do? Do as usual. You lose. You'll stay in bed until ten, think about a better world and have a rest. I know who told me that. Agirl... - What did she tell you? - Something about the spring. It was warm... some colours... Rain... storks... a little stream... rocks... lambs... Easter... the sky... the family... Can't he be helped? In the camp? I'll see the doctor. He won't refuse to help me. Leave Gluch in peace! Gluch in peace, Kraft too... On, two, three... eight, nine, ten. The Commandant won! Nothing will come of him! Some people are useless all their lives. He has a nice gym, enough food, anything he wants. He is afraid of taking risks. Look at him! Now, he wants to box, although he's been in kingdom come for ten seconds! Such a type... What's wrong? How do you feel? Well... but sometimes... when the match is KO... I... pains... In your head? Yes... I can't words - remember? - Yes. What words? I don't know... Compatriot, you're a fool! What's wrong? He's losing his memory. One might envy him. That's the result of your punches. KO every third day. That must have led to concussion. Yes, he must have counted on that. It's a pity you didn't warn me. If I was malicious... I would congratulate you now. Look! What can be done? When a day off... I better head... All right. In that case he must go to the mental hospital. Not so fast. I've also restored other cases to health. Take one a day to strengthen your nervous system. Don't worry, I use it too. You could have been dead. You really must have problems with your sense. Two pills a day. You'll be a genius in a month. Get out! You'll remember everything your father forgot, even before you were born. Are you alive or did I cross the Great Divide? Are you here? - I am, Willi. - Mr. Willi. I hoped not to see you again. - But... Willi. - Why that friendly talk? Have you forgotten who I am? I must punish you. Punish? You look chirpy. Can you see the wood? Chop it... all of it! Yes, sir... Willi! How are you feeling? Well now, Commandant. Carry on. You know that's good for the muscles. Years ago, I out half of Schwarzwald. Hand them to me! Is something wrong? Commandant... Get out! Two prisoners have escaped again. Stop mumbling! Can't you report? Number! Twen... Add him to the list of the dead. Leave! Do you want all the line to go instead of you? I love red roses! They grow wild in our place! You flies, you mob! You broke the rules of the game again! You deserve punishment for this foul. But I want to be high-minded. You will either stand at the roll call station for 24 hours, or until we catch the deserters. You are free to decide. I don't like procrastinators. I order a punishment exercise. Clear off! I'll punch his face in! Train! Pack it in. Train! Why don't you train? I didn't send you away yesterday to dream. Didn't I tell you? Flies! You'd like to fly! Funny, Commandant! You're pretty good now. Why is it only in training that you punch so hard? Are you afraid? Of me? The boxer who is frightened, is done for. In my opinion twice as much. I am out of condition. I saw. I mean... my feet... Feet this time? Train, nobody's preventing you from doing so. I can't. Why not? I can't train here. Shall I build a stadium for you? I can't train here. You're right, in fact. Shall we go in? Gentlemen, be my guests! Doctor, I can't accept that. To wash the dust away wouldn't do any harm. Keep an eye on him! Halina, guests are here. Stop! Sit down! Kominek! The Commandant orders you to come and have a beer! And what about me? Keep an eye on the car! The running was good. The day after tomorrow we shall run again. We must prepare for ten rounds. Ten rounds? Of course! You will see something now. Commandant, the flies are not so exhausted. Thank you. What was the run like? Fine... I overtook Kraft over thirty metres. Provoking him again? He knew when and where to stop. He bought me a beer. Beer? Was it good? I wonder! A pretty girl drew the beer. I have never seen such eyes. Not to mention the rest. I'd become a marathon runner because of her. Do you know her name? Halina... Why? Will you go running again? By the way, I almost forgot. Kraft's planning a ten-round match. What do you think of that? We'll talk about it in the evening. I'm glad you are so keen on sports. I was serious. I assume you are always serious. Go on. Commandant, I demand that you do not take Kominek out of the camp. You demand!? Prisoners may only leave the camp when they work outside. It's the Commandant who decides on the prisoners' work. Koml'nek's work is running. We could inquire in Berlin if it is useful work. They have other problems in Berlin. Walter will consider your opinions. Asshole! He has no idea about what boxing demands! You shouldn't have talked to him in that way. It's better not to irritate Holder. I think my position is stronger. Is it clear? We must take a decision. That must be her! As for Kominek, I'll vouch for him! Yet I worry if we can demand such a risk from him when the boxing itself... Stop it! He's the only one who can get to her. I know but... Attention! Continue! I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner. It doesn't matter. Come on. These are my friends. What's the matter? We talked about the girl in the pub, Halina. We want you to go and see her. What about her? Bend down, underwater! Listen, boxer. Halina is our messenger. We are organising an escape. We must let her know and ask how many people they can hide. Will you do it? Will you take me with you? Yes. And Venilak? You'd better think of yourself. Do you know what you are at? Old chap, now I can... also for you. I agree. Wait, let's train a little. What shall I do if she doesn't believe me thinking I'm a provocateur? I love red roses. They grow wild in our place. StaÂ§ko's words. Our password. Halina will understand. Bend your knees... Come on, bend! Are we going alone? Are we going to run? No. Commandant... Willi, translate please. It's perfect weather for running. Nonsense. It's too hot! Willi, translate it, please. He says it's perfect weather for running. Go! We must get some kilometres into our legs! He says you must get some kilometres into your legs. Ten rounds... fitness... Go now! Do you want to run? Run then! Run! What an asshole, to run in such hot weather. Kominek! Come and get ready! The time has come for some important tests. I'm coming. There are Colonels waiting for you. Beautiful women... come on! Come on, man! Help yourselves. I baked them myself. Ladies and gentlemen! You can bet. Bet on how many rounds the prisoner will last. Six! Foufl One! Five! Three point fourteen. I know Walter. He won't last more than two. - How are you feeling? - Well. - And you? - I have a match. How many rounds should I bet? How many would you like? About six, seven... Bet! Would you be able to knock Kraft out? Once at least. I have a new girlfriend. I love her. She costs me a lot of money. These are the mysteries of human lives. Well, will you do it for me? Don't tease the devil, Willi! All right, you devil of mine. Is he really a prisoner? He should be shown to the international commission. I always say that work is ennobling. I introduce to you the camp champion, the prisoner Kominek. Shall we applaud him? Sport is sport. Shall we have a bet, madam? Again? One hundred marks that Kominek will last seven rounds. And another hundred that the Commandant will go down. I need money. Let's begin! It's a deal but you'll lose today. Ready! First round! Kominek, no false modesty. He's not attacking at all. Why don't you attack more? What for? You are the better. Does it matter? Think of my bet. Why are you slacking? Do you expect to eat for nothing? He thinks if he's a friend of Kominek... Friend of Kominek? Him? Kominek? I know him. Let's see if you deserve such a powerful friend! Move! Up onto the heap! Faster! Right to the top! Come on! Sixth round! Ready! Box! The KO now, and I win. One, two, three... six, seven... Box! One more! I lost. How are you feeling, Walter? Well. Isn't he presumptuous? It's a sport! Really very well, boy! But you don't attack enough. It is not possible all the time. You must attack! Otherwise I forget to defend myself, you counter, and it makes me look stupid! I'll try. I should think so. Seventh round! Ready! Box! Come on, Walter! Cross! Keel over, young one! What punches! Give him his due! Well done, Kominek. Very well! I'm losing my Spring- I can feel my feet swelling. Go down finally! Our stake's in the bag. Eighth round! Ready! One, two... six, seven... Box! Come on! Ninth round! What was the use of that? I don't know if I'm able to stand it. Asshole! We could have had time off now. After the match, Willi. Don't say you want to win! Last round! Ready! Walter Kraft won seven rounds, the prisoner Kominek three. The winner is the Commandant. Your punch is starting to get harder. Congratulations. But don't think you would have won. I'd have been on my feet at nine. Let's have a shower now, boxer. Commandant, I'd like... to ask... What do you need? It is hard... fighting with you. I need some kilometres in my feet. I would like to go running. Don't you feel fit? No, I don't. You will run. Here? With me. Equal conditions. Old chap, I'm going running. What? Where's Venilak? When? - He went down three times. - Really? I could have won. And I will. I'll show what I can do, once at least. - And what then? - I must sleep now. Mum, don't beat me! Training? Yes, sir. Won't you join me, Commandant? Frankly speaking, I won't. I had a trainer, he is dead. He used to say three rounds after a difficult match would do no harm. What's he saying? Three rounds after a difficult match will do no harm. Helga, what do you say? You'd better have a rest. The sportsman should supply his heart with blood a little. Three rounds? Everything in moderation. TWO? So, just one round. One round? Are you planning to become world champion? One round, not more! Will that be enough for you, Commandant? Absolutely. Good. - Good morning. - Morning, Doc! Aren't you doing too much fighting? Oh no! One round only. It's good for the heart after a strenuous match. You seem to know a lot about everything! Even in medicine. Thank you, Doctor. - No bet today? - We can. No! A friendly match. Stop it, Doctor! He'll kill him! Who will kill whom? Shall we finish? Shall I blow the final whistle? No. It's only sport. Release me! The bastard, he hit me below the belt! I'll teach you the rules! I let you live but you hit below the belt! - The punch was within the rules. - Shut up! The punch was fair. Holder, he's yours. I thought the prisoner would be mine when you no longer need him. You have the whole camp for experiments. This is an extraordinary case. I examine the impact of boxing on the living organism. I'm not interested in your problems! I've devoted myself to him for a long time. He who plays foul has no right to live! As a referee I'm almost sure the punch was fair. What did you say? Holder, take charge of the prisoner! Thank you, Mr. Willi. That was nasty. I don't know if it's a good idea. What? You shouldn't have left him to Holder. He's a bastard. He hits below the belt. Sure, you're right. But there are also other opinions. - Like? - Like that of Gluch. If you send Komlnek to the gas chamber, people will say it's because of the knock-out. I don't care. Now. But when you get back into the ring after the war you'll have the finger pointed at you. Don't you understand? He hit below the belt! Be high-minded! You're a sportsman. Nobody must have grounds to suspect you behaved badly. Shall I appear at the roll call station with a face like this? That's not so important now. To return to the ring after the war with an untarnished reputation is what matters. Do you think some people are so mean they could blame me for my decision due to unfair behaviour? People are even worse. Much worse. He did beat Kraft! Commandant, let me give him a lesson. You'll see a punch now, boxer. The Commandant orders the prisoner to be brought back now! Come closer, Kominek. Your name is Anton Lipinsky now, is that clear? These are his release documents. He's free now... in a way. You are Lipinsky now. You must be outside the gate in five minutes, is that clear? Yes, sir. There are your clothes! Put them on! Willi, will the alarm sound? What? Will 40 people from my hut be sent to the chamber for my escape? Oh God, why do you care? Translate it! What does he say? He's asking whether there will be the usual measures. Asshole! I am giving you life! Get out! I want justice. I won't translate that. I want... fair play, Commandant. He who hits below the belt has no right to use that word. Will there be an alarm? I want to be certain of one thing. The punch was below the belt, wasn't it? Here, your papers. Willi, see Lipinsky out, beyond the camp gate. There will be no alarm. Holder, frankly, was it a fair punch? Kominek knocked you out fairly. He was better than you. But that doesn't matter. May I make a call? To Berlin? Precisely. Don't bother, Holder. We will do so ourselves. Give my regards to Gabika! YOU? Good morning. Good morning. I love red roses. They grow wild in our place. Follow me! Daddy! Dad, he came from that place. Welcome. We've been waiting for a year but nobody so far. Everything is ready. Halina is to walk with you. Rest in peace... Don't worry, we have a good shelter. Hurry! Come on! Let's not waste time! I came to tell you the escape is being prepared, be ready and wait. Will you come too? I'll try. English subtitles edited by: D. Shearman THE END
