(clapper snaps) - Hi boys and girls I'm Bruce Burger and I'm Peter Pepperoni his pizza pal and this week it's sneak preview at Funland and that means a dollar on every ticket goes to a very worthy cause, isn't that so Timmy? - [Director] Cut, Bruce try not to be so rough on Timmy, Timmy's the poster child remember? - Oh sorry Timmy. Say he's not contagious or anything is he? - [Timmy] Where's my agent? - Employment at Funland is more than just a summer job it is also fun, it is a place where the fun of work never stops. There are many fun positions available such as park hostess and ride operator but the fun doesn't stop there, no. Other exciting positions include fry cook, the litter patrol, sanitary napkin clog monitor, customer regurgitation brigade, lard courier and scum scraper. Please sign the interview sheet and state your job preference. Does anyone have their application ready at this time? - Doug Sutterfield, staff photographer just keep writing we're doing some PR shots for opening week. You ever model or anything? - Me a model, right. - Just keep working don't even look up pretend I'm not even here alright? (camera clicking) My idea's kinda to follow an employee through the whole hiring process, you know watch you filling out your forms your job interview, getting your uniform fitted, stepping outta your clothes. - My name is Darlene Dorkner, I'm a graduate of State University I also attended the David Lee Roth University where I studied rear projection, I type 300 words a minute, I can create my own software and I hope to promote world peace through the use of electronic office equipment or superior fire power which ever come first. (clapboard clicks) - Hi boys and girls I'm Bruce Burger and I'm Peter Pepperoni his pizza pal, do you know what time it is? It's time for Funland. - [Director] Cut! Bruce that was great but you spit on the lens. - [Bruce] It wasn't me. - [Director] Well if you didn't who did? And don't blame Timmy he's asleep. Wake him up it's take 88. - Well, thank you Miss Acintime. What do you think? Anybody. - Bruce is a little frantic. - Frantic? He's a damned fruit cake. - [Angus] I happen to like him. - Yeah well I do to he's a likable fruit cake, it works for him. - Now can somebody tell me why everyone has such a blind loyalty to this clown? - Anyone want to explain Bruce to Kristen? Mike? - Well you see Kristen our Bruce Burger represents Brewster's Pizzeria Palace, home of the pizza burger and every year, during opening week, Brewster's under rides us just a little bit until the money comes in... - I know why you have a clown from Brewster's, what I'm asking is why you have a clown from the twilight zone. - Well our Bruce has been with Funland since the park opened, he's well he's one of the family and he was a remarkably fine clown. - Is he clowned out or what? - Last year during opening week we had what we like to call a slight problem with Bruce. - What Mike means is that Bruce went berserk in front of a group of 100 senior citizens who were at the park for digitalis day. - Oh well I'm sorry but if he can't go the distance like every other clown I know then maybe he should find another pop stand on the midway. I'm sorry but you don't pay good money for sentiment that you can get for free. - Now, now I realize that Bruce is a little eccentric alright or he's a lot eccentric but he's not dangerous. He isn't dangerous is he? - No. - There you see? All we have to do is keep an eye on him during this opening week, the excitement makes him jumpy and we wouldn't want to have another incident like that one last year. - We had to tranquilize him like we do the park dolphins. - Bruce is the good will ambassador for all of Funland people love him. All we have to do is make sure that he doesn't speak to them. - Hi job seekers, do you know what time it is? It's time for fun with me Bruce Burger. And can you guess what Bruce has in his pocket? - A hole for when you're bored? (laughing) - No I have a very special friend with me and maybe we can coax him to come out. Please come out sir please come out. Aw come on come out. No. Please come out all the boys and girls wanna see you. Look! It's Peter Pepperoni, hiya kids hiya, hiya, hiya. (phone buzzing) - [Secretary] Bruce. - Yes? - Mike will see you now. Hey everybody let's give a big round of applause to Bruce and his pepperoni. (applauding) - [Angus] Now that's a hell of a slogan. - That's one of the promotional tie in's for our opening. Shop that at the front gate and you get two dollars off the ticket price. - Great idea. If you can't sell it give it away that's what I always say. Oh there's one change in the press releases. No more wax museum I told operations to close it down I've even had a few offers already on the wax figures. I'm gonna put in something new some kind of a thrill ride for the kids maybe based on a cartoon character thing, you know somethin' silly and crazy. - Hi Angus. - [Angus] Hey Bruce. - Hi there Mike. - Hi. - I'll talk to ya. Why don't you come by my office later and I'll buy you a coke. - Oh thanks a lot. Say Mike can I come in and talk to you? - Yeah sure. - May I come in too? - Yes Peter you can come in too. - You come on in. Thank you. - What can I do for ya? - Well I want the name on my check changed. - It's made out to you isn't it? - No it's made out to Neil Stickney. - Right Neil Stickney, that's your name. It's been made out that way for 10 years. - That's why I want it changed. Why should Neil get the money? - Because he, because you are, oh Christ. - (clears throat) What Bruce is trying to say is why should Neil be the one getting the money when Bruce is the one busting his buns. Stop it I can talk for myself. Well excuse me for trying to help but I'm out there bustin' my buns too. Will you please stop it we'll talk about it later. Later, later, it's always later. Stop it. I'm sorry but you don't know what it's like living with Peter. - Okay listen if you don't want the check made out to you who do you want it made out to? - I want it made out to me Bruce Burger. - So you're saying don't make it out to Neil. - Forget Nei, Mike I heard that Neil once had a nervous break down. - (Laughs) Brucey, Brucey ever think about endorsing some other kind of product maybe you know like how 'bout mixed nuts. I'm so, neverm, okay look I'll call accounting Monday bright and early and see if we can get the name on the check changed okay? - Oh thanks a lot Mike. One more thing we want a bigger dressing room the one we got right now's to small, to small. - Hmm, I guess with you and Bruce and Neil in there it does get kinda crowded. - I'll say it does. Well it would be nice, I'll tell you what Mike I'll come by later and give you a list of all my demands ok? Thank you Mike. Thank you Mike. Bah bye. Bah bye. Where we gonna go to eat? Oh let's eat at the commissary. The commissary? - [Announcer] Good day Funlanders and welcome aboard. VIP night is only seven days away so start practicing your smiles remember a Funlander without a smile and a hello is like a cheerleader without her pompoms and her clothes. - Well, well, well Chip Cox. Is that a blue windbreaker you've got on? Have they gone and made you a junior supervisor? A nickel an hour what are you gonna do with all that extra money? - Sutterfield just take the picture. - [Doug] Oh yes sir Mr. Cox. Look real good, show us one. Perfect except you have a little brown at the edge of your nose, yeah. (camera clicks) Perfect. (camera clicking) - I'm Chip Cox your junior supervisor and I'll be instructing you today in the proper working procedure of the watermelon theme concession stand. Now how many of you are good with knives? (camera clicking) - The key to Funland security is getting the job done without getting in the way. Now a kid is breaking into a line what is your reaction? Now let's say I'm the kid breaking in, Darlene how would you handle it? - Freeze maggot brain or your balls are history. How's that? (camera clicking) - This is a Brewster's crust bun. It is manufactured in Toronto and then shipped to Cleveland where the mozzarella cheese paste laminate is applied. Every morning take your pepperoni stencil and apply three and only three of your pepperoni glob dots. (camera clicking) - I'm not sure what Neil wants. You know what Angus I'm no psychologist but I don't think Bruce even knows that he is Neil Stickney anymore. Look you sure you don't wanna think about retiring Bruce? - No, no, no. - Alright how about getting Bruce just to send him back to clown college just for the opening week please? - Didn't you ever throw sticks in the stream when you were little? Some of them caught the current and went right by the rocks and the limbs and some of them didn't, some of them get stuck on a sand bar or trapped in a back water and they never could seem to find their way back to the flow. I put Neil in that group. - Oh come on you're a business man Bruce is a clown. - Well not in the beginning. No when I met Bruce, excuse me when I met Neil he was right outta college he was our original accountant then he could really make a balance sheet dance. - Well that must've been before Neil had his nervous... - Breakthrough? Listen Neil, Neil is gonna be just fine. Believe me it's not the alligators you have to watch out for in the swamp, no it's the mosquitos, and speaking of mosquitos is Hurley up to speed yet? - Oh God still pitchin' slow ball. - Seems to me there's somethin' kinda dense about him. What about Kristen isn't she just a little bit... - Aggressive, pushy, abrasive? (laughing) - Now wait she's alright, she's brand new right out of grad school and she wants to be sure to make success with her coming, I hired her just because I knew she'd be tough. Hey look at this will ya, just hey look this is great. There's something about the air this time of year - Ah yeah it smells like money. - Everything is great. The park looks great, the kids look great and when we open we are going to be great. - But he managed to walk to work everyday, to his job at the skillet creek grill and that employee had a wooden foot. (applauding) - Thank you and thank you. Well now, here's somebody we all know Steve Murphy Murph the Surf. (applauding) (cheering) - Murph's up he's out he's rappin' to ya. How many kids out there listen to me on Q91? Let me hear it from ya. (cheering) (applauding) How many of you watch midnight videos? Alright. How many people out there think that Bruce Burger's feet are as big as his shoes? Hey Bruce who does your wig? General Electric? (laughs) So remember when things are really down kids at least you don't have to be the man in the clown suit. Keep listenin' to me I'm outta here bye bye love you. (applauding) (cheering) - Thanks dude. Well boys and girls I realize looking out over your sea of eager young faces exactly why Funland gets better every year. Now there've been some rumors circulating that I am planning to sell the park to developers this year, all I can say is they don't know Angus Perry very well because the day that they take this park away from me it will be over my dead body. (laughs) (applauding) (cheering) - The body, that of Angus Perry, owner and operator of Funland, dead at age 58. The body was discovered less than an hour ago in the brackish back waters of the Costawalla river. Mr. Perry's coupe de ville was found parked on the bridge above with a suicide note taped to the steering wheel. With the live action news eye cam I'm Janna McMartin for WSUA. Bob, back to you. (phone ringing) - Mike Spencer can I help you? Yes Shelly I'm watching the news. Uhhuh it's tough. Well yeah sure the VIP preview's already scheduled. Yeah the funerals on Thursday. The eulogy, I don't know, who's doing the eulogy? (morose music) - Well boys and girls I guess we all know what time it is for Angus, our beloved father of Funland has bought himself a season ticket on God's roller coaster. He was the father of our family and like all families I guess we had our differences I remember Mr. Hurley leaving Angus's office one afternoon shouting at me that incompetent son of a bitch is to old to run an amusement park why doesn't he just die. Well he has. I remember Mike, Mike would confide in me that Angus's beloved Funland was just another pit stop on the road to some place better and I remember Angus the thrill he would get every time Miss Willingham would bend over and sharpen her pencil, he would look at me and say Bruce I'd love to take my shoes off and run barefoot through her tits. - It's true I mean he was the nicest man I ever met in my life. - And now let's bow our heads. Dear God why did you take our Angus when you coulda had any one of these people, amen. - I never thought this would happen to Angus like this. Did I tell ya I met him in a bowling alley? - I know this has been a strain for you having to get these arrangements in such a short time, I'm sorry. - Mrs. Perry I just wanna say that we'll all miss Angus very much. Oh what a lovely dress black makes you look thin. - Ah Mrs. Perry we're all very sorry about Angus please accept our condolences. - Thank you Mike, oh by the way I've sold the park to amneco. - You've sold, excuse me Mrs. Perry but well it's just that I've always thought of Funland as being you know in the family. - Well that's what made me feel so comfortable I've sold it to a family the DiMauro's, Mario DiMauro and his sons. They own amneco. I really didn't wanna sell it at first but they did put up a lot of collateral the bulk of the Funland stock. - But Mrs. Perry with Angus gone you own the Funland stock. - Well they bought the company so they own the stock now, I guess they can put it up for collateral if they want it's called a, oh what is it? - A leveraged buy. - Yes that's what it was a leveraged buy. You know Angus always said that Bruce was such a financial wizard before he went and lost his... His interest in money. - So what's leveraged buying? - Well leveraged buying is getting more and more common it sounds like you're buying what you're getting when in fact you're selling what you're buying leveraged buying. Well that's what Neil says anyway but what does Neil know he never has any fun. - Well anyway they'll be at the offices tomorrow and explain the whole thing. (ominous music) - I'm Mario DiMauro this is my son Carlo. - Papa. - This is his brother Larry. See Carlo if you have a question see Lawrence if you have a problem. Carlo. - This is a get acquainted meeting, we have had access to the company files and know everything about you and you don't know anything about us. (laughing) - Excuse, I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Say Mike this is the complete list of my demands I told you about review it and go over it with these people I'll be back in my dressing room, thank you. - Who is that guy? - The local Bruce Burger. A few changes we would like to make. (door bangs) - Excuse me ah just one more thing. Do you know how long you're gonna be? - Larry. - Hi Larry you're a dear. Cause I was ow, alright it's no rush, no rush I can, I'm in my room all day. (door bangs) - Thank you Larry. - [Larry] No problem. - There are three changes we would like to make. First Michael Spencer will assume temporary responsibility as general manager until a permanent replacement is recruited. Second we want everybody to cut expenses by 20%. - 20%? - What are you some kind of an echo? I want everybody to cut 20% they gotta feed the kitty the kitty don't fat I get mad. - Third Bruce Burger needs a bigger role in the opening. - I am having a nightmare. - Not our Bruce Burger. - Not that idiot in the wig I mean the national Bruce Burger. - The national Bruce Burger will be arriving shortly. Brewster's Pizzeria owes us one (laughs). Questions? No? Then let's get going. - And remember feed the kitty I want a 20% cut I make room in my operations for people who can cut. - Hey you know I kinda like your hair it kinda does somethin' to me. - Oh thank you you know I always say why look natural if you have the time you know. - Let me just say Mr. DiMauro your organization maybe the salvation of this park. - Well thank you. - You know it's (laughing) it's very refreshing to meet a man who knows the value of cutting overhead while raising production at the same time. You let me know if there's anything I can do to make your transition any more pleasant. - Actually there is one thing um we need to locate Neil Stickney. - Ah who? - Neil Stickney he's a major stockholder in Funland. - Hmm I've never heard of him but I will research the corporate records for you. - Good and Kristen? - Yes Mr. DiMauro. - Do it quietly. (ominous music) - So where we goin'? - What are you talking about? - On our date this Friday? - Date, we have a date? - Look I know you're overwhelmed by all this I mean humble employee being favored by the high profile park photographer... - Look I have no interest in going anywhere with you. - Does that mean no? - Mmhhmm. - But why not? - Well for three reasons you happen to be arrogant, conceited and egotistical. - Hold on egotistical and conceited are the same thing that leaves you with two, I'll pick you up on Thursday. - [Girl] I'm busy. - How 'bout Friday? - Look I'm working late Doug I just don't have any interest in you, you're not my type okay? - I see now, you're the one who's egotistical. You're the one who's conceited, you're a snob. - I am not. - Yes you are. I mean you don't even know me and yet I'm not your type. You are a snob. - I am not. - Then why won't you go out with me? - Well maybe I will. - No you won't. - Yes I will. - Okay, how about Saturday? - Friday. - Eight o clock. - Seven o clock. - Okay. - Guess I showed him. (bouncy music) ♪ Way down upon the Swanee river far, far away ♪ That's where my heart is turning ever ♪ Down where the old folks stay ♪ Way down how I love ya, how I love ya, ♪ Swanee river, that's where the old folks stay. - What was that? Singing? Dancing? God, I've seen epileptics kick higher during a seizure. - For Christs sake Ruth Ann would you please get Mr. Joseph another cup of coffee? And make it fresh. - For Gods sakes, get those arms down this is not a float in the rose parade. - Okay Bertram here is a revised schedule for the VIP preview. - This pile of poodle poop will not be ready for VIP day. - Oh not now Bertram I have my own problems okay? - I told you when I took this job this is one fairy that doesn't come equipped with a wand. (knocking) - Bruce? - Hi Mike. - Hey, how you doing big guy? - Say, don't you say hello to me? - Hello Peter. Listen, Bruce, could we have a moment without Peter, just you and me? - Okay, I can take a hint. Listen now that we're alone I wanna find out are those new boys, they're gonna play ball with us because if not Mike I may not work the park opening this year. - Bruce you're not gonna be working the park opening this year. - But I work it every year, I've always worked it every year, its my wooden jubilee. What about the spend opening day with Bruce Burger contest? Angus would never let this happen. - Yeah I know but Angus owned the park, I don't. And you see these new owners, you know, they want the real Bruce Burger. - The real Bruce Burger, he's the real Bruce Burger. - Okay, I'm sorry I didn't mean to say real, I meant to say the national Bruce. - That no talent. - Yeah, right, yeah. Oh another thing, he's gonna need your dressing room to, okay? - Well where are we gonna dress? - Well I don't think, hey! I know what, we can put you in a wax museum wouldn't that be great. You love the wax museum. - That's no good, there's no privacy there. - It's closed. Angus closed it, don't you remember? Okay look. I'm gonna need you to start packing this stuff up and getting out okay? Need any help with some of this or? - No it's okay, Peter and I can do it all. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay, hey, thanks you're a real Funlander. (ominous music) - Oh, you're a real Funlander, you're a real piece of candy, you are. Don't talk that way to me. Why didn't you say that to him? Stop it. You make me wanna puke! Well you can't puke, you're a Muppet! - Mr. Pizzaburger, hey big guy how're you doing? Chad, Mike Spencer Funland. I really appreciate, you know you're making me look. - No. - Chad you have to understand. - Absolutely not, I told you on the telephone it's bad enough you make me deal face to face with the little snots at all but I will not spend an entire day with one of then just because he won some inane contest one of your cretins dreamed up. - Chad we promised the child the real Bruce Burger now if you... - Read my lips, I refuse, absolutely, no negotiations. I will not spend one minute with your precious little lucky winner. - You know Chad if I could... - I want to play Hamlet damn it, not a hamburger! Oh please. Listen, I realize that a tiny mind can make even the simplest mental tasks difficult but try to understand I don't like this, any of it. I'm doing it for one reason and one reason only. That reason has nothing what so ever to do with liking children. Which I don't. With liking those dreadful little gut bombs you call pizza burgers or liking anything about this retched little business you call public relations. It has to do with money. Pure and simple. Filthy fricking luca. Now I've given you my career for it, my reputation, my name, leave me my soul? This is my dressing room? God, what a dive. Who are you? - I'm Bruce. - Oh no, don't tell me. This is the image I'm projecting to the urchins of America? God help us all. - You use this on your face? Your pores must be the size of nickles. - Don't worry, all of this will be out of here soon. You were supposed to be out of here bozo. (throat clearing) - Bruce, I don't believe we've been properly introduced. Chad you know Peter Pepperoni don't ya? - Put that stupid puppet away or I'll use it to blow my nose. - Tell him to shove a coal up his ass and we'll use him to mop the floor. (ominous music) (thuds) (gentle music) It sure is dark in the wax museum now that it's closed. Where have all of the wax figures gone? Oh so this is what life is like at the top. Gee the air is so thin here I can scarcely breath. Ahoo, ahoo, ahoo. Come on Peter, this is just temporary, you wait. Pretty soon I'm gonna start throwing my weight around. Aw take an enema. I'm warning you Peter, don't get fresh with me I could just throw you across that room! Oh, I'm so scared, look at me, ah I'm shaking, ah I'm shaking. Will ya just stop it, would ya? Sit down. Say, could you give me a cigarette? - No. - Come on Peter. Give your partner a cigarette. - Oh he isn't my partner, no, no, I'm a solo act now. - You know Bruce the whole worlds coming apart. It's not the time to ruin a beautiful partnership. Last year this was a pretty good set up, I had friends here, I could call it home. But times change. Now I'm being shipped off to a museum in Chicago with Richard Nixon. Aw thank angel, now get back in the box and I'll be there in a minute. Look Bruce what I'm trying to say that the problems of three little people in your case Bruce, Neil and Peter, don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Look I'm not much at making speeches but I know you gotta take what you can get. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you would never take this, you never took this in any of your movies. - That was back in the 40s when a guy could shoot a few people and make a difference in the world. But times have changed. Look at me I'm Chicago bound and I can't even pick my own company. - Well what am I gonna do. - For one thing, you can stop feeling sorry for yourself. - Excuse me, I'm looking for Denise Wilson? - What do you want now? - Why Denise is that you? What are you doing here? This is like the reform school for the UN. - Well I went out with you, that's why. And I broke a date with Chip to do it. - I complement you on your taste but since when can Chip Cox reassign people? - Well he can get Hurley to do it. - Ah, P G Hurley. I think this calls for a little retaliation. - Oh no. - Oh yeah. - No. - Mhm. - No. Oh come on I have to go to college, I need the money. - Something subtle yet appropriate. - No, come on. - A real case of adolescent vandalism I think. - No. (snap) (upbeat music) - Doug I'd like you to meet Mr. and Mrs. Peppers, this Doug Sutterfield our staff photographer here at Funland. You know Doug, Mr. Peppers is the driving force behind rectal supplies, I want a great shot. - Rectal supplies huh? Maybe we should take this shot over where it says deliveries in the rear. (laughing) - He's funny. - Shut up. - I got a great idea, why don't we have the VIPs and the junior supervisor take a shot of you right over here. Come on Mr. and Mrs. Pepper. Go ahead kay. Right there, we'll get the water and the background, it'll be beautiful. Stand there, let's see. Oh, that's wonderful. If we can get a little closer please, just a little. Back up now, we'll get you right in there, perfect, beautiful shot but Mr. Peppers, if we could just have your arm around your lovely wife. There we go. - Get on report, I'm putting you on report! (laughing) - Tada! (kids cheering) - [Kid] He had 'em up his sleeve, it's a magic trick, you can buy it at the store. - Oh no you can't these are the official Bruce Burger funny flowers. - [Kid] And he's not really Bruce Burger. He's just an actor. - Am not. - [Kid] Am to! - Am not! - [Kid] Am to! - Am not! - [Kid] Am to! - Am not! - Hey there's the real Bruce Burger! - Now wait a minute kids, no, no don't, the funny flowers. (kids screaming) (sad music) - Wanna see my funny walk? - [Announcer] This is security, paging Mr. Wally Pepper. Paging Mr. Wally Pepper. Please come to the front tier section of the park and pull your wife out from under the mechanical bull. - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen Funland has come to the end of another fun day the park is now closing but we remind all our VIPs that the grand opening is this weekend so be there, thank you and have a safe trip home. - You said you knew where the keys were. - I do know Wally, they're in the car. (laughs) - I said check the keys, not lock the keys. - This is Officer Dorkner I've got a 2079. Somebody locked their keys in their car durkamole. Alright, clear the area, stand back please, stand back, get the little lady out of here, come on, folks, stand back, stand back, come on I've got other people to take care of. (gun firing) Thanks for coming to Funland, have a good day. (carnival music) - Good morning Funlanders, only one more day until grand opening. - Well I see every one is here. Well we have noticed in the news paper that there is some speculation about amnico's take over of Funland and there have been some responses from within the company that are not compatible with our business philosophy. Frankly we're disappointed. - Pissed. - Open your folders, we have listed more appropriate responses. Here, page three. Possible question from the press. Does it disturb you that amnico is the object of a federal investigation? Now your reply might be investigations of the nature mentioned are conducted by our own federal government much of which is located int he district of Colombia, our nations capital. Funland is certainly in favor of government of one kind or another and most of the management here are citizens and some are still registered voters and have participated in federal elections. So there. - Memorize it, let it sink in like cement. - Now the problem is how to draw attention away from these unfounded rumors and focus attention on the good wholesome fun that is Funland. Now case in point the golden horse shoe review. It needs to be spicier. - Spicier? - Tits. - A Vegas style chorus line. - Tits, any problems? - No, no, I'm a big tit man myself. - Second on the agenda a replacement for the former wax museum. I think we've found the theme for our new attraction. Everybody this is Byron Mandle he did most of his work at the past two world fairs Byron? - Hello. This idea is awesome. Celebrity death and disease. It's like a roller coaster ride through the Betty Ford clinic. The people ride through in these little hearses past the audio animidroid displays. This is Natalie Wood's row boat. See how that works? Then we have the king of rock and roll on his throne It's so sad, so sad. Then we have John Lenon in front of the Dakota. They die every 30 seconds, I can move that up to 20 seconds if you needed to move the crown through any faster. - Nah, 30 seconds is fine. - Good, good, inside we have Jimmie Hoffa's body being dumped into the cement to make a bridge abuttment in New Jersy - [Mario] Philadelphia. - Thank you Byron now that is fun. You have the green light, go ahead and draw up the blue prints. Mike we'll need to have a meeting about how to promote this. Well that's it, thank you everyone. - Excuse me, now are you sure this attraction is a good idea? I mean I'm not sure it's gonna draw the right crowds. Of course it'll probably make a lot of money. - Then what's the problem? Ah, I see, not your taste. Kristen, amnico is leisure service company we don't make money questioning how people recreate we just supply by the recreation. - Let me explain business to you. Al Capone, may he rest in peace, once said you can get anything you want with a smile and with a gun. But you can get a lot more without a smile then you can without a gun you understand? - You'll have to forgive papa he's a bit old fashioned. - Well, what's good today? ♪ Look at here ♪ We got fresh hot burgers from apple pies ♪ It's pump, it's pump, with all beef chunk. ♪ Coupled with doughnut you can slam dunk ♪ We can't get loud with our hot french fry ♪ And you can't be late with our chocolate shake ♪ The ice is cold, a dog turned nine ♪ Our service is good, we almost forgot (screaming) - Cut it out, will ya! I'll have a hamburger please. - [Angus] Give me one of those to, will you Bruce with some cheese on it? - Uh and a cheese burger please? Yes, thank you very much. What are you doing here? - Don't forget the beans. - Beans please. - Maybe some peas to. - Peas please. - That macaroni. - Macaroni please. - Oh and cream corn that's my very own favorite. - Oh I remember, oh cream corn please, a lot of it thank you oh that's good. - A couple of brownies. - A couple a brownies. - And lets top the whole thing off with an orange drink. - Okay, let's top the whole thing off with an orange drink. Maybe I'll even get myself an orange drink to, what do you think of that, huh? - Little hungry today, huh Bruce? - Well half of it's for. Yes I'm on, I'm quite hungry, I'm so hungry I'm almost starved. (whistles) - I haven't eaten in days. How have ya been? Pass the salt. - Oh you know you should really cut down on salt, it's bad for your blood pressure. - So what happened at the funeral, tell me all about it, was it great huh? Oh hey, who did my eulogy? - I did, uhuh I told them how you were the father of Funland and how we were all one big happy family and. - Oh Bruce that's sweet. Darn it I wish I'd heard the thing but well the lid was shut. Tell you what though I really am glad to see you. - Aw I am so glad to see you, you know what the DiMauro's did to me? - Did to you, well what do you think they did to me, this isn't ketchup you know. - They killed you? But why? - To get Funland, this is the ideal place for them, don't ya see? There's a huge cash flow, you can launder money here, you can hide excessive profits from shady business dealings, it's a great tax loss, and on top of that the whole place is worth a fortune, come on you remember Bruce you used to be in finances before you lost your interest in it. Well I didn't forget, I've been taking good care, I'm the one that set you up with that stock plan. - Yes I remember that, thank you very much. - Oh boy am I hungry. - Of course you're hungry, you've been dead for three days. But which one of them killed you? - Larry. - Larry? - Larry. Keep an eye on the brief case of his. - Well we gotta do something. - Well that's why I came to see you. - Okay. - We're not gonna let them use Funland. - Alright, no. - Bad enough they stole it, they're not gonna ruin it to, no we are gonna stop them. - Yes sirree we're gonna stop them hand in hand, shoot from the hip, yeah. - Hell yes, remember when I started this place I said this is the book keeping, I ordered the souvenirs, I mopped the floor. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, what do you mean I, I, I? - We did the book keeping, we ordered the souvenirs. - Neil Stickney - Neil Stickney huh. That's right, he did do a lot then. - Did he? We had good times in those days though huh? (laughing) (gentle music) - Now this is all I was able to find on Neil Stickney. For some reason his file is incomplete I mean he was on the pay roll until last week so he must have worked in the park somewhere. - Is Mike around, I've gotta see him? - Well Bruce, why don't you try his office? Now let's see, where were we? Oh here oh look I found out that Neil was one of the original Funland partners. Now I checked his mailing address but he hasn't lived there for ten years. You know it's almost as if he has disappeared. - That would be nice. - [Mike] What? - The DiMauro's killed Angus I swear. Larry's got the gun in his brief case, see it's all a matter of hiding tax profits and tax losses. Amnico sells out to amniplex, amniplex sells out to amnirealty, amnirealty says the property is to valuable to be an amusement park so amniplex takes the loss while amnirealty cleans up! - How do you know all this? - Angus told me in the cafeteria. - Angus? Perry round jovial sweet silver haired Angus? - That's the one, now Angus says we can block the sale to amniplex if, if we buy the remaining stock options which go public in the next two weeks. - That isn't the point. - I know what the point is, this isn't their park, this is our park, Angus built this park. 25 years ago this place was just a merry go around in a corn field and now it's a shrine to fun. People go to church to pray, they go to polls to vote, well they come here to have fun. - [Angus] Give me two, make 'em good. - Well Burger, what are you gonna do? - Give me one. - Yeah Bruce, tell us what you're gonna do. Now that you're all washed up. Hey, no offence, but a dead man and a wax figure, well they just ain't much of a match for the DiMarcos. - One for Peter, and dealer takes two. - The way I figure it Bruce your back is to the wall. It's just a matter of time before they kick you out of here. It is up to you to stop them, you're the only one who can do it, you are the only one who can save the park for the kids and the families and the generations of Funlanders yet to come. - Yeah, but how? - Sabotage. Sabotage the grand opening, that'll show 'em. - Oh wait a minute that's a little extreme isn't it? - Yeah I felt that way once. Back in '39 in Paris that's when the crowds marched in and my girl walked out. I was left with 50 thousand Jerries breathing down my neck and a sick feeling in my gut that's when I found out that sometimes you gotta cut off your hand in order to get rid of the rash. - What the hell is he talking about? - Sabotage. It's not a bad idea Bruce. - [Carlo] And fire Bertram Joseph the artistic director, we're bringing in our own man. - I know we're trying to make cuts but these are deductions in the kids salaries, you're asking for problems. - If they don't like it the bus is on the corner. And you'll note we are cutting the weekend rock concerts, to much cash out lay up front. Questions, comments? - Yeah, I'll shoot straight okay? It's about your brother Larry, some people have problems about his behavior. - Papa, Lawrence is being bad again. - This is what breaks a father's heart. He has two sons, my son Carlo, he shines like a light. He's sensitive, looks good in a suit. My other son Lawrence, he's selfish, vindictive, spiteful, ill tempered and low, a real puppy kicker. Takes after his mother. But down deep he's really a good boy. - As you can see Larry's a problem that worries us all thank you for noticing, any more comments? - Uh yes. I'd like to talk about Bruce Burger. Now I know we like him but the days of the happy Funland family are over. Now this is a corporation and not a charity. We have two Bruce Burgers here. Two, I think if we need to cut the budget that's a good place to start. - Look Bruce has always been the. What I'm saying is Bruce is Funland there's no other way I can say it. It's not enough, then it's not enough. - Dump the bozo. - It's not enough. Would you take care of that Mike? - Me? Wait a minute, no way. - Good Larry can handle it. - I'll do it! I'll do it. - Thank you Mike. - Now here's how I see it. The enemy's two major divisions are food and beverage and operations knock them out and the rest fall like a house of cards. The key is confusion, unbridled chaos, the two weakest points clock tower and the p a system. How do we knock them out? The computer the x g 7000 cobra mark six. Break the code and you break the park. - [Announcer] Good morning park personnel. (ominous music) - Brucey feels good today, zowie does Brucey feel good and tomorrow is the opening yes the opening and we are going to pow bring Funland to it's knees. (bottle whistles) Hey where's a, where's? - Oh he's gone they picked him up about an hour ago probably on his way to Chicago by now. Oh come on Bruce I'm sorry he's gone to but we did give it a try didn't we? Look it's not your fault I mean we've all gotta go sometime believe me (laughs). You know I wish they had killed me in cotton you simply cannot get stains outta this polyester. Well guys I gotta be going the party's over and I am late. - Late for what? - It's just a little joke Bruce relax, you know you win some you lose some. So long Peter. - [Peter] Bye Angus it's been real. - Goodbye Bruce I won't be seeing ya again. So take care of yourself okay? I'm sorry, but there was nothing we could do. - [Peter] Boy dead people give me the creeps. - [Man] Bruce. - Angus? - Bruce where are you? This isn't easy for me, I know how you feel about the job. The DiMauro's want you out, you're fired. I'm sorry. - It's that national guy isn't it Mike? They really want him huh? First he takes my dressing room, then he takes my job he wants it all doesn't he Mike? - No, no listen. I'm really doing you a big favor. - Okay. - This could be the beginning of a big thing for you you can get a real job out there. Listen to me the DiMauro's want you outta here tonight. Security needs your park id and wardrobe needs the costume the wig and the shoes. - They want my suit huh? They want my wig huh? They're gonna get, I'm telling ya Mike that Chad he's an impostor he hates kids he told me so now the real Bruce Burger he loved children. - If it were up to me you could keep it but wardrobe needs it okay? Look do me a favor and make this one easy for me. Look on it as an adventure after tomorrow you won't be Bruce Burger, starting tomorrow you'll be Neil Stickney ok? I'm sorry but there's nothing we can do. - Nothing we can do (coughs). Nothing we can do Peter (coughs). (briefcase clicks) - [Peter] Where'd you get that? First you mess the computer in the clock tower now you steal Larry's briefcase. (pieces clicking) Say maybe you better put that away. Come on Bruce put it away, Bruce this is the last time I'm gonna say, you know the national Bruce Burger is a person too and I don't think the boys and girls will like it one bit if you blow him away. - Then screw 'em. (gentle music) - [Announcer] Your attention please this is park security. - [All] Ride the big one. - Thank you and here's your Funland discount card. - [All] Ride the big one. - Thank you and here's your Funland discount card. - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Funland's grand opening where the fun never stops. Besides all the great rides and super attractions we have some extra special treats in store for the whole family. - Dear heavenly father for the fun we are about to receive may you make us truly thankful and let us remember while we are having fun not to enjoy ourselves to much for that would be sinning. - I wanna go home, I wanna go home. - We've come up to Funland to have fun and you're all gonna damn well have fun if I have to beat it out of you. - And remember before you use the water fountains be sure and let me spray the handle with disinfectant and don't use the park restrooms. If we have to use the rest room we're gonna go back to the Winnebago. - Good God I think I'd rather be shot that go through this day. - [Announcer] We open in 30 minutes Funland will be open in 30 minutes. (voice speeds) Ladies and gentlemen Funland is now open. Let the fun begin. - I don't care. No. I said close the gates. It's only 8:30 don't let anybody else in. - Mike look it's our first lost child of the day. - What did you bring her up here for? Take her down to family reunion. - Well I tried but nobody's there yet. Did you know somebody opened the part a half an hour early? - Yes, yes. (phone ringing) Ah let the kid stay here I gotta get down there and see what's goin' on. - Did you know they had this ride tied into some kind of charity? Well you're my agent man you're supposed to tell me these things. Yeah well do I get a cut or what? (sniffs) Well look man this deal's supposed to promote me not some kind of stupid charity. Oh yeah well listen to this pea brain you just screwed yourself out of job. (clicks) - Chip. Chip! - What? - What the hell are you doing it's 8:30 you're not supposed to be open. - Can you believe I let those philistines talk me into this? God the power of the dharma. An entire day with some fawning little yard ape. - Chad I... - Two years a Julliard, two more at the royal academy of dramatic art, an apprenticeship at the Guthrie, private instruction and direction by some of the more visionary minds in contemporary classical theater and for what? I've played Henry the fifth, Marc Anthony, Romeo and Iago, Oberon, Richard the frigging second for the love of God and now I'm play a pizza burger. A pizza burger! And I could have been another Olivier. The effortless power of a young Richard Burton the Washington post said and now I'm on national television hawking junk food to five year olds and you tell me not to be depressed. - [Girl] Well Chad if you don't like it why do you do it? - My love, does nothing remain in that admittedly lovable but limited mind of yours long enough for anything resembling a thought process? Don't interrupt listen closely cause I won't repeat it again. In over 10 years when some of the most prestigious repertoire companies on this planet the most money I ever got paid, the largest sum I ever received for my talent, the most generous compensation ever given me for pouring my heart out in iambic pentameter on the legitimate stages of this country was 500 dollars a week, before taxes. I couldn't keep my manicurist around for that amount. An entire day with a child I'd rather be dead. - Chad I... - Leave me alone. Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by the son of York. (kids screaming) - You can't do what you're doing and get away with it. You've mistreated employees and terrorized the entire staff. I'll stay through the grand opening but after today I'm gone. - No, you're gone now. Larry why don't you help Mike find his car. - The same way you helped Angus find his car? - You're pressing your luck. Forget his car Larry maybe you'd better drive. - I found him (laughing). Neil Stickney you are not going to believe this. - So where is he? - Oh I don't know where he is but I do know who he is. He's Bruce Burger. - Well wait a minute you mean that cement head with the wig. - That cement head with the wig has option to buy controlling interest in this park. Kristen you have done great, Larry get your briefcase. - Carl I meant to mention this I can't find the briefcase, I had it yesterday. - Larry you have come to work without your tools. Papa will be very disappointed. And I hate your shirt. - It's a new shirt Carl. - Hello security. - [Security] This is security. - Did Bruce Burger hand in his id last night? - [Security] I was not on duty last night sir. - Well check right now okay? - [Security] Yes sir. That is a negatory report on the clown and his id sir. - [Mike] He didn't? - [Security] No sir. - [Mike] Alright did anybody over in there see him at all today? - [Security] He was spotted last night at the clock tower computer. - [Mike] This is Mike, you look around, you find him and you call me the second you see him you understand? - [Security] Sure I'll do that sir. - Bruce please don't do anything stupid. - You got to get up, you got to get up, you got to get up in the morning you, you got to get up, you got to get up. - Shut up or I'll blow your head off. - Help, help, I'm up here, I'm on the clock tower with a killer clown help help! - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen please direct your attention to the park coaster where the national Bruce Burger and DJ Steve Murphy for a few rounds on the Waylon Wrecker give them your support and don't forget to bite the big one thank you.

The local Bruce Burger heroically stopped mobster Larry DiMauro's assassination attempt of Chad Peller the national franchise clown, Doug Sutterfield was an eye witness, Doug. - Thank you Jenna hi there Doug Stutterfield here ace photographer Funland media park representative. We're asking people how they rate today's tragedy and look here's teen model Denise Wilson. At any time today did you feel frightened, scared feel as if you wanted to rush into my arms and cling to me? - You're a nut, I mean you're an attractive nut but you're still a nut. - Oh come on tell that tv audience you're crazy about me. - Come on let's get outta here. - Give me, give me that. Bruce Burger who has chosen to keep his identity a secret told this reporter in an exclusive interview, "I only did what I had to do and I'd do it again if I had the chance". - Well you know Jenna we had a little bit of a security problem kind of a crowd problem but they called Funland security wham bam thank you ma'am no more problem you know because when this puppy barks people listen. (gun firing) - [Camera Man] Oh God I've been shot. - From the grief stricken park a tragedy for WSUX eye witness with action alive news team update I'm Jenna McMartin back to you Bob. - [Bob] Thank you Jenna. Meanwhile a local dj is still on a world's coaster endurance run since a malfunction prevented the coaster from stopping. And Funland has a new owner tonight his name is Neil Stickney the arrest of the DiMauro family on charges of embezzlement and racketeering dropped the price of Funland stock to less than 50 cents a share. (knocking) - [Bruce] Come on in it's open. - [Mike] Bruce. Bruce Burger. - Mike how the hell are ya. I was gonna call but. - I have to talk to you Bruce. - [Neil] Neil. - I have to talk to you Neil. - Why so touchy? I know it's hard to be up after today. What a day huh? But don't worry we'll pull ourselves up again we always have, remember six years ago, well it was your first year, we got Miss Boat a rama to open the park and she showed up tanked. - Look I don't know how or why it happened but you went crazy today, really crazy. - Neil woul, I was as sane as you Mike. - Then Bruce Burger went crazy he had a gun Neil a gun. - Mike a clown can get a way with murder. Now sit down, I wanna tell you what we're gonna do with the park, we gotta do somethin' sensational to make people feel like they have to come back to Funland. The DiMauro's got one thing right they said you gotta grab the people by the balls if you want them to turn their head around, Angus always used to say if you make a mistake feature it. Okay we've got a disaster on our hands I know that but I think I've got a sensational ride idea. It's an indoor roller coaster and it's called are you ready for this the nuclear helacoster (laughs). It's more than a thrill ride Mike it's a ride that travels through a city that's been leveled by the bomb it's physical, it's visual, it's emotional and it's topical damn it. - Mr. Stickney here's that ledger you wanted. Okay if that's all you want I guess I'll be goin'. He's so cute he's just like little bear isn't he? - How'd ya like to make a pizza outta that? Oh. Mike one last thing. I received your resignation today. Well I'm afraid I can't accept it. (crinkles) - No Neil, keep it. My mind's made up. Oh, when the workmen went up to repair the clock this afternoon they found something up on the balcony I think it belongs to you. - Ah leave it on the desk. (ominous music) Peter, what are you doing there? It's the first time I've seen you without Bruce. What is this doing in your mouth? Okay, okay. - [Peter] Is this our office?
