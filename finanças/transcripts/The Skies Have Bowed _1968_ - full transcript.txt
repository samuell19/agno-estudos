So make it fast sir, or else.. The fat crows of Darjeeling will eat my body. Don't you worry, human. I will myself come with you and do it. Sir, he should be punished. Come, human being. Sanjay, what did you do? Dear Hanuman, dear Hanuman, stop now. He was a lovely boy. Uncle, why you need to cry. The insurance company will reimburse your damages. Donkey. Vachan Singh, we lost 300 rupees. You fatty, have some shame. Oh Sanjay! Once you enacted death and today you are really dead. My sister Priya has become a widow. "Friend is no more friend, love is no more love". "Friend, I lost trust in you". Sir, hanuman, my friend. He is crying. I'll comfort him. Hanuman. "Friend is no more friend, love is no more love". See uncle, he is crying now. He never gave me a penny when I was alive. Sanjay. - Yeah, tell me. - Why did you die so early? I never died. Look, I am standing in front of you. - Come, let me hug you, my friend. - What did you do? Why don't you listen to me? Hanuman. Oh Hanuman! "Friend is no more friend, love is no more love". Sir, sir, never before brother! They can neither see me nor hear me. Yes, human. You are just a soul now. They won't be able to see or hear you. Then sir, quickly take me to my body.. So I can at least wipe my friend's tears. It's a deep problem, human. They have burnt your body. Now what sir? Now only the great powers.. Residing in heaven can solve this problem. So make it fast, sir.. Or if their office is closed, I'll be dead.. And tomorrow is a Sunday. - Come. - Come. Sir, you will have to give us a solution. There is only one solution and that is put this soul.. In another body. True. True. What? No that will never happen. Oh great powers, listen with your ears open. I don't want anybody else's body. I want my body. But human, your body is destroyed. What can I do? It's your fault. It's the error of your department. Silence human. Silence. Just cool down. Just leave me sir. You guys are amazing. If these people put me in somebody else's body.. How will my Priya recognise me? She will definitely recognise you. The ghost has erred because of your appearance. What do you mean? The human who was supposed to die.. Looked exactly like you. That's the reason why the ghost bought you here. So sir, it means you will put me in that body. Yes. Then how will I remain myself. I will become like him. Human, you will be yourself only. The truth is the soul. It is the feel, the brain, the pride. The body is just soil. That is alright. But sir.. Will Priya and Hanuman recognise me as Sanjay? Definitely. All people known to you will recognise you. But you will have to pay for the deeds of the body. But sir, I will go in the body only if I like it. Definitely. - Promise. - Promise. No daughter, you should not go there. They are rascals. They cheated a good woman like grandmother. T.K. And Prem, both the brothers are such rascals.. That I have kept you away from them since childhood. And today, will you go and beg sympathy from them? I will ask for justice not sympathy. You came here again. Sir does not want to meet you. You cannot go inside. Today I will not go without meeting him. See it won't be good for you if you force. Shut up! Talk slowly. This house belongs to a reputed person. Hell to his reputation.. Who does not consider others human. Selfish! Fraud! I would have killed him, had it been in my hands. This girl also wants to kill T.K., Why not use her? According to me, your father is completely innocent. Really! Yes. I have checked the details of the accounts from the office. And I have also convinced my brother to meet you. I'll meet him right away. Not now. Then when? - In the evening. - Ok. Brother will meet us at 7:00 P.M. Sharp. - I'll definitely come. - Don't forget. - No. Ok. I'll take your leave now. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Wow sir, it feels great flying. Which city is this? This is Calcutta. Oh! Calcutta. Isn't this the Howrah bridge? Yes. And that is Chaurangi. Devilal, what is boss doing? Sir is reading something? Ok. Just get our things from the suite of Grant hotel. Ok. Long live Earth. Long live Earth. This is a beautiful house, sir. Whom does it belong to? You will get to know. Sir, what is that man doing? He is getting ready to shoot. To whom? His brother. So sir, let's go and tell the cops fast. This is a crime. You forgot again. Nobody can see and listen to you. But sir, we should do something. Is Mr. Prem home? You came again! Priya! Sir, Priya. Priya, you are here! See, I am also here. You know where am I coming from? Never before brother! Right from up! Priya. Priya. Sir, I am destroyed. She is not even listening to me. She is my Priya. Silence human. Hello Ms. Priya. Hello Mr. Prem. Am I late? Not at all. You are perfectly on time. Come, brother is waiting for you in the library. Come. This way please. Go ahead. Hey Priya wait. Sir, she is going inside. As lord wishes! Mr. T.K., T. K sir. Leave me. What's happening? You have killed my brother. - No! - Shut up! You rascal! See he is blaming Priya. You rascal, bastard, let me go. I'll leave you. First let the cops arrive. Sir, please save Priya. Not me, but you can save Priya. - Me? - Yes. How sir? By entering that body. I agree sir, come fast, help me enter his body. I would have never run, had I shot T.K. In fact, I would have considered it a great deed. Hello. Hello. Police. Police. You heard sir, Priya hates this man. She will hate me too. If you want to save her life, you will have to enter this body. Oh lord! Where have I stuck? The bullet is out! Go and enter his body. As you wish, sir. Sir, never before! Come inspector. Leave me! Inspector, she is the one, who shot Mr. T.K. Arrest her. - Where is the body? - It's there in the library. Wait inspector, I am totally innocent. - This man is framing me unnecessarily. - The truth will be out soon. But inspector, listen to me. Come inspector. Good evening Mr. T.K. Good evening. Your brother Prem called to say that you were murdered! - Murdered? - Yes. Actually I went to sleep some time ago. It seems Prem has started day dreaming. What? You just send him inside. I'll just call him. Thank you. How silly of him! Silly of him. Yeah. Mr. Prem, Please come. Get in, please! Constable, let her go. I am so sorry, Ms. Priya. Due to Mr. Prem's foolishness, you had to suffer. - Mr. T. K is alive. - What? I am very sorry about it. Hell with a person like this.. Who does not care for other's reputation. It would be better, if he would have been dead. Mr. Prem, come here. Forgive me, brother. I swear, that girl is very cunning.. She wanted to kill you and she told me that. What has happened to you, brother? I sent his father to jail on your orders. Hence she wanted to kill you. Go and free Priya's father from jail and say sorry to him. Get out. Very good, human being. This is the first sign of a good soul. But sir, the distance between me and Priya has increased. Now how will this distance decrease. She does not hate your soul, she hates this body. You will have to pay for the deeds of this body.. But you will definitely get the fruits of your soul. I'll take your leave now. See you later. Where are you going, sir? Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Drink. Sir. - Drink! - Yes sir. No. No. Take it away. Sir, you must be tired, why don't you rest in your room? You go ahead. Yes sir. Come. Hanuman, leave me man. Hanuman, leave me man. Hanuman. Hanuman! Good morning, sir. How have you been, sir? Did you sleep well? You must have your medicine sir. What is all this? Champagne sir. - Champagne? - Champagne. Yes sir. No whisky. I don't want anything. Good morning, sir. Today is Saturday, September 18. Ms. Aroona and Rina Ghosh had called up to say.. They are attending the party in the evening. And Mr. John Taylor will meet you in the office at three. Sir, will there be any new guests in today's party? Choose your outfit, sir. Your bath is ready sir. Who am I? Sir? Who am I? Sir, you are our boss, Boss. - Boss? - Yes sir. Am I the boss? Yes sir. You give us our daily bread. Boss? So, you all will obey my commands. Yes sir. Ok. So everybody get out. Why are you all not going? Get out! Yes sir. Hey you! Come here. Come here! Get me a cup of tea. Tea? Yes, hot tea. Yes sir. Yes, tea sir. Yes sir! - Good morning, sir. - Greetings. Come brother, come. You walk ahead. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Mr. Prem, the solicitors are waiting for you in the room. Ok. Yes Mr. Ghosh, please come in, Mr. T. K has arrived. - Thank you. - You are welcome. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. T.K. - Good morning, sir. How come you are at the office today? Because Shankarlal's case is closed. Brother has set that old man free. But those people are not at all genuine, Mr. T.K. The daughter of Shankarlal is very much against you. She always keeps on cursing you. What have you not done for them? You gave them compensation, you gave them importance. I suggest it would be better if you rethink about this case. Ok Mr. T. K, we'll take your leave now. Good day, Sir. Good day, sir. Bye Rita. Bye. My sick boy. Is this a joke? You still think it is a joke. Are you tired of me? Who are you? Oh! Will I have to remind you about me? Go and do your work. This is my job from now on. I am tired of this environment in just two days. Then let's go out somewhere. Where we both become one last month, Switzerland. Nowadays, it's very romantic there. Oh Shut up! Hi sweetie. Why are you crying now? Did anything happen today? The elders have rightly said.. "Always be away from the horse's back.." "And the boss's front". Stop it B. K Is anybody else in there? It is better if you don't meet him today. Why? His mood is very bad. Mood is bad. It won't be bad after meeting me. I have bought something that speaks, money. "Money, Money, money is everything". Rita was right. - Who are you? - Relax my dear, relax. If that girl spoils your mood, then sack her. There is an abundance of girls nowadays. Search for one and you will get thousands. What do you want? Your intelligence, which mints money. Yesterday's race was excellent. Everything was on our side. I have got the cash, sir, cash. So are we going to the club? We'll make plans for the other race. There are two wonderful horses we can bet on. We will wash away all the bookies. Next time don't come here with this money. Boss! Get out! - Hello. - Is Mr. T. K home? Yes, he is. What happened? I am Dr. Mathur here. Call him on the line grandma is very serious. Yes. Sir. Sir, Dr. Mathur is on line. Sir, grandma is very serious. Grandma? Yes sir, she is not well since many days. It seems her condition is very serious today. Forget the old enmity sir, today you will have to come. Hello. Yeah T.K. Dr. Mathur here. Grandma has suffered three strokes since day before yesterday. Her condition is very serious. Your presence is very important. Oh yes. I'll be right there. The car is ready. I'll get your coat, sir. Who is this grandma? - Surilal. - Yes sir. Where has sir gone? He is gone to see grandma, sir? Her health is very serious. - Grandma? - Yes. He remembered grandma's health after 10 years. Ramdas. Yes sir. Why does grandma stay in a separate house? What can I hide from your sir. - Sir. - Yeah. Can I tell you something? Yeah tell me. You know that grandma's is a very hyper person.. But her heart is full of love, such people are very rare, sir. Just forget everything that happened, sir. Forget it? Ramdas, I can forget only if I remember anything. You won't understand. Have your medicines, grandma. May your medicines destroy in fire. They can destroy a perfectly healthy human being. Grandma. Ramlal, what are you doing here at midnight? I am fine and happening. You go home. Your wife and kids must be waiting for you. Grandma, look who's come. Who is it? Who? Come here. Come. Come here. Why have you come here? You had promised not to see my face till my death. Go away, it's still time for me to die. - Grandma! - You shut your mouth. Go. Why are you not going? Forget whatever happened in the past, grandma. Ramdas, he threw me out of the house. He could not get rid of his bad company, he left his grandma. Now, those days have gone, when I would see him.. And immediately give him a hug. If he is so stubborn, I am nothing less. Enough grandma, have your medicine. Just take it away from me. At least have your medicine, grandma. I told you I won't have it. No! No! No! Grandma, have this medicine for my sake. You fool. A mother craves for love of her child, not medicine. You are here, I'll be alright now. Perfectly fine. I am perfectly fine now. He's changed so much. I don't believe he's my grandson. It's all because of the lord. Good. Very good. Will you write the letter yourself, sir? If you wish I can call the secretary. No need. You go. My dear friend, hanuman. I am perfectly fine here. But he thinks I am dead. Mr. Hanuman Singh. We are very sorry to hear about.. Your friend, Sanjay's death. As you are the only heir after his death, he has left.. Ten thousand rupees in your name. We request you to reach Calcutta as soon as possible. The airline ticket has been sent along with this letter. Our person will be there to receive you at the airport. Your well-wisher, insurance agent. Yes Sanjay, what did you do my dear friend? You were right, you have nobody in this world except me. No mother, no father, no brother or sister. A friend should be like this. Sanjay, what will I do with these ten thousand rupees.. When you are not there anymore. Oh Lord, you take this money and give me my friend back. Hanuman brother, be brave. You will have to keep this money. Ramdas, the flight has arrived. Ramdas, you go and receive him. - Me? - Go! Greetings! Are you Mr. Hanuman. - Yes. Who are you? - I am Ramdas. Oh! You are the one from the insurance company. You father figure, I am the less privileged.. For whom he did all this. What are you doing? Forgive me, my nose is leaking since morning. Come, Mr. T. K is waiting for you. T. K (Vaccine)? Which T. K? Of small pox or cholera? Your childhood T.K. Childhood T. K! I put those in the childhood. You are getting me wrong, the big boss has come to receive you. Oh! Big Boss has also come. Let's go. You please carry my luggage. You go ahead I am getting it. - Hanuman. - Hi! Hanuman! Dear Hanuman. Hanuman. Hanuman, Hanuman. What happened Hanuman? Hanuman, Hanuman. Ramdas. Ramdas. Hanuman, Hanuman. Hanuman. Hanuman, Hanuman. Open your eyes, Hanuman. Sanjay. Hanuman, listen to me. When I came back, my body was burnt. Oh! Sanjay. Hanuman, first listen to me. Hanuman, Hanuman, and then, and then. The sage put my soul in my look alike's body. Hanuman, I am the same Sanjay, your friend Sanjay. My soul is the same, only the body has changed. You got it. Got it. I got it. Got it. But you are not Sanjay. - You are somebody else. - Who am I? You are Sanjay's ghost. Save. Save. I am Sanjay, your friend Sanjay. No you are not. You are not. Listen to me at least. You are ghost. Ghost. Ghost. Hanuman! You are Sanjay's ghost. Hanuman, I am not a ghost. I am your friend, Sanjay. Ghost, please don't eat me. I haven't taken a bath since months, I am stinking.. Take my smell, take my smell. You fool I am not a ghost. You! "Ghost of the kicks, don't listen to the talks". Legs are broken. Legs are broken. - Legs are broken? - Yes. Ghost, how do you know all this? You fool, at least listen to what all I know. Do you remember, I stole 10 bucks from your hat? Yeah, I remember, give me back my 10 bucks. Give back my 10 bucks! And you forgot that fatty gave you a punch on your nose. - That was because of you. - Because of me? - Yes. And you shut me in that cupboard. - That was because of you. - Because of me? No. That's because of sister Priya. Because of Priya! You are a fool like your uncle. You even know my uncle? I even know your grandfather. Now you understood. - Yes. Yes. - Come on shake hands. Come on give me a hug. Sanjay, how do I forget? I burnt your body with my own hands. You are still a donkey. Ok. Do one thing. Tell me the story of your journey.. To heaven once again. Only once. Journey to heaven! Once again! What happened? Sanjay, my dear friend. Oh! I'll have to burn him again. I don't even have money to buy wood to burn him. Oh! He is really dead. What happened? Oh God. I am dead. I came back to the same room again. Is this a house or magic? All the rooms are the same. You! Who are you? Hey. Talk respectfully or else you will have to lose your job. Don't you know me? I am Hanuman... Sanjay's friend. Sanjay? Who Sanjay. The owner of this house. Is anybody there? Where have all of them disappeared? - Yes sir. - Listen... give this pigeon to eat something and throw him out. Devilal, who is this stud? What is happening here? I am sorry, sir. He is big boss's friend. - Friend? - He is just arrived from Darjeeling yesterday. And he is big boss's younger brother. What did you say? Younger brother? This idiot. He must have adopted him recently. Anyways, from today you are also my friend. Idiot. Brother has made this house a zoo. Listen, get me a cup of cheap tea. Right away, sir. Hanuman, what happened? Nothing man. I was just narrating your story.. But your servant is not ready to believe. You fool, why are you publicising the story? Come on, let's go to meet Priya. - Meet Priya? - Yes. Very good. I will narrate the story to her. She is the only one who is intelligent like me. You fool. You will spoil the whole drama. And what about my sister's future? - So will you not relent? - No, I won't. - You won't? - No, never. Then let me call the sage. I will put your soul in a dog's body. Dog! Sanjay, please don't do anything like this.. Or else the municipality will take me away. So tell me, will you say anything? - No. I won't even breathe. - Sure? - Sure. Then go and jump. Sanjay. Sanjay, the water is wet. These today's boys are fools. They get scared of the girl's father unnecessarily. Oh daddy! What if Priya thinks I am T. K? "There is no mountain or ocean between us now". "Come, see the dreams of my heart". "Come, see me, my sweet heart". "Come, see me, my sweet heart". "Sweet heart". "The rains have come, the spring is here". "My heart is singing, my soul is vibrant". "The rains have come, the spring is here". "My heart is singing, my soul is vibrant". "There is no mountain or ocean between us now". "Come, see the dreams of my heart". "Come, see me, my sweet heart". "Come, see me, my sweet heart". "Sweet heart". "Am trying to calm my soul, the soul is not calming down". "You come, calm down my soul, I have tried my best". "Am trying to calm my soul, the soul is not calming down". "You come, calm down my soul, I have tried my best". "There is no mountain or ocean between us now". "Come, see the dreams of my heart". "Come, see me, my sweet heart". "Come, see me, my sweet heart". "Sweet heart". "The bride is ready, come along with the procession". "Take me where I belong". "The bride is ready, come along with the procession". "Take me where I belong". "There is no mountain or ocean between us now". "Come, see the dreams of my heart". "Come, see me, my sweet heart". "Come, see me, my sweet heart". You are so far away from me, and yet so near. When will you come? Priya, I am here. Open your eyes. No, you are Sanjay's shadow. You will disappear as soon as I open my eyes. It's better if you are captured in my closed eyes. At least, see once, Priya. Sanjay! When did you come? Recently. - Are you here since many days? - Yes. And you were watching all the drama from far away? Sometimes here, sometimes there. And now here. Far away from you. - Let's go. - Where? - Just come with me. - But where sweetheart? It's such a beautiful day. I and daddy were thinking about you and you are here. Daddy? Yes. He will be very pleased to see you. I was going to get him to Darjeeling.. If you wouldn't have come here. Darjeeling! It is left very far away from me, Priya. Great. But life here is not like it was in Darjeeling. No problem, it will become like one. How? Daddy will get you a nice job at Mr. T. K's office. - There? - So what. You are concerned about your job. What have you got to do with that rascal? Rascal? Yes. He is a big rascal. If you would have seen our condition a few days back.. You would have killed him. I wish I could kill him. Leave it. Your hands would have become dirty. Come let's go home. No Priya. Not now. Let me become something and then I will meet your dad. And what till then? Till then, we will meet each other. Where? Here, everyday, this time of the day. Will you come? Yes. Let's go, driver. I am completely drenched. It's raining heavily outside. The clouds are also very dense. It's seems like the sky will finally bow down. Sky bows down only in books and stories, daughter. Not in reality. Oh daddy. Should I tell you something? The guy you call by the name of fool... has come to Calcutta. Who was with you in the park? He was Sanjay. Was he Sanjay? Yes daddy. He did not come to meet you. He says he will meet you only after he becomes something. Don't you trust me? No. Because he was not Sanjay. Oh daddy. I know that the guy with me in the park was Sanjay. But dear, your Sanjay is something else also.. Apart from being Sanjay. Mr. T.K. Come on down. Congratulations on your success. I will be back. I have never seen such a party in my life. You are the king of Calcutta, Raja. All the big people have come. I might start shivering looking at your influence. Prem. Mr. Mulchand had come. He was talking about the bill of exchange. He was saying only seven days are left. Am I right, mummy? Hey, Sanjay. You never offered me a cup of tea also in Darjeeling. And you have invited so many people for dinner here. You used to act like you were very poor. Huh! Hanuman, neither that was a lie, and nor is this. Yes, my friend. The truth is that you are Hanuman and I am Sanjay. We both are bearing the fruits of our deeds. Come darling Hanuman, come with me. Oh! I think I have done some great deeds! Come, sweet heart. Enjoy everybody! Cheers! Sanjay. Sanjay. Oh God. Oh God. We know someone who has some very good stuff. But he sells in black at a premium of fifty percent. Whether you buy today or tomorrow. His mood was bad in the morning, it's better now. Go. Your life will be set. Good luck. Please. B. P, please behave yourself. Why are you crying now? T. K does not belong to one, but all the girls, Rita. All these girls, whom T. K admires. From when did you start knowing his preferences? To tell you the truth, that's my real job. I am sure you will not miss this golden opportunity. It's a very sweet proposal. I'll take your leave now. T. K darling, where have you been? I was looking for you. Where have you been? T. K, don't be rude. Priya.. Leave me alone. Listen to me. I know what you want to say, Mr. T.K. How do I explain you? I am living somebody else's life. You have told me such false stories a lot of times before. Believe me Priya, all those stories were real. But now. Now I don't even have the control over the truth. You have always lied, now you also suffer from it. I don't have the time to trust your stories. Just go away. Oh! This guy had never done a good deed in his lifetime. I wouldn't have entered his body, had I known him. Selfish! Rascal! Idiot. Why are you cursing yourself? You? What are you doing here? I am waiting for you. Get out. I say get out. Just go away from here. Why this strange behaviour today? Are you in a bad mood? I will treat your mood. You always said that I am the solution for all your problems. Oh lord. God bless you, son. God bless you. How are you? Forget about me, how are you? I am good. Perfectly fine. What is the problem? Why are you hiding it from me? There is something, grandma. It seems I have no one in this world. Why do you say like this? Am I dead? Don't say such things, grandma. I am regretting entering this body, this life. I am very happy today. One girl has evoked so much warmth and so much love in you. Tell me who is she? There is someone, grandma who hates my body as well as my shadow. No son, she would be hating your reputation.. Your black money and your past. So what should I do, grandma? I am tired of this life. The past has left a stain on my head. Just wash away that stain. Just distribute all that money which compelled.. You to do all those bad deeds. 'Our country will benefit greatly with this place'. 'I can only say that we all should be one.. And god bless us all'. Brothers and friends. Whatever I have given you.. Does not belong to me, it belongs to you all. Your hard earned money is being returned to you. I request you all to keep up the good work.. So that our children can get more benefits. Greetings. Bihar relief fund... Koyna Nagar, blind institute orphanage. Let me at least take one. Not even half. All this money belongs to God. - God? - Yes. - I mean, God has so much money! - What? But when will you return my 10 rupees? That I'll give you from my own earnings. From your own earnings! Then I will definitely get it. - Brother. - Here, one more has come. - Come Prem. - Come. Excuse me brother. I have to tell you something urgently. - Yes tell me. - But. Oh! Don't worry, he knows everything. Brother, I need 3 lakh rupees urgently. What? 3 Lakhs! I had taken it for my expenses from Roonie. I have to return to day after tomorrow. I am sorry, Prem. I won't be able to give anything. Dear, this is God's money. When this Hanuman didn't get it.. - Then what will this Ravan get. - Shut up! Brother, just think. This money is the result of your hardwork.. And my honesty. You are distributing it. I ask why? Why? You can leave. Prem brother, I am sorry. Can I suggest you something? A lot of money is going to be distributed.. Amongst the poor tomorrow morning. Why don't you change your appearance and wait.. In the beggar's queue, you will at least get something? Idiot. Ok Sanjay, I will take your leave. Bye Bye. - Hanuman. - Yes. - I will take a minute. - One moment. - You may go now. - Now it won't come. Have a glass of chilled water you will get it. - Have you read this? - What? Brother has gone mad he is giving away all the wealth. Wealth is like a soil in the hands. It must be for you, not me. I cannot see my hard.. Earned money being wasted like this. Stop talking nonsense. What have you earned? You call dishonesty hard work? Do you remember.. Your parents had left you when you were a kid. My daughter-in-law and I have brought you up like Battu. And Battu kept his father's word by accepting you as his own. Even I have made my blood and sweat one for the wealth. Not one. But you have separated blood relations. With your black deeds you have separated him from me. Now when he is on the right track.. You are coming in his way, why? - Grandma! - Dare you call me grandma... you rascal. Just go away. Good. A capitalists turns socialist. Priya, I think a stone hearted man.. Is turning into a kind hearted one. What do you think? Listen, you are giving bonuses and distributing money.. To everybody, what about me? What do you want? A good daughter-in-law. Where do I get one from? Why? Have you forgotten Priya? Hanuman! Hanuman! Yes. Who is this Priya? - What do I know? - What? I mean, I don't know her parents and family. But what I know is that she is Sanjay's sweetheart.. She likes him and everything's alright. Who is Sanjay? Your T. K is my Sanjay. Ok. Where does she stay? In Calcutta. - Calcutta? - Yes. Mother isn't Priya Shankar Lal's daughter? Shankar Lal! - Is Shankar Lal there? - Yes. Oh my God! Mother. Priya, Priya! Greetings mother - Long live. - My good luck that you are here. Sit down. Why did you take the trouble to come here? You should have just given me a call, I would have come running. - Just sit! - Greetings Shankar Lal sir. - How are you Ram Lal? - Yes. I am fine. Priya! Come here dear. Take her blessings.. She has brought you up! Long live! She is the same as her mother. Isn't she? The same features. Do you also cook like her? Or is she among the girls who get made up all the time? She cooks mother. She does. Ok then, go and make a cup of tea for me. But you don't have tea mother. Can she get something else for you? Today I am going to have tea made by Priya. Go. Go dear. Sit. You grown old but still have no sense. - Ramlal. - Yes mother. Do you know why am I here? No. I don't. But I am aware as to why. Then why didn't you come and tell me? Mother, how can a lamp be compared to the sun? God! During your marriage too you were saying the same. If I wouldn't have intervened.. Then you would have been a bachelor till now. Now go. Come dear. You met Battu in Darjeeling. Right? Who battu? I have sent your father in the other room.. So that you don't feel shy. What are you hiding from me? Tell me. Didn't you meet him? But he.. He is my grandson. I fondly call him Battu. Hanuman has told me everything. - Hanuman? - Hanuman calls him Sanjay... his parents called him Pappu.. His colleagues call him T.K. He does not have one name. Chairman, president and God knows how many. But you have led our family's spoilt man the on the right way. You have done something that I could not. I did not do anything. What is the matter between you two? Why is he so sad? Today he was saying he is a dead body. I am dying to see a daughter-in-law, and he is dying to see you. You won't listen to him, but will you not listen to me also? Have tea grandma. Priya... Priya! What is the matter? Who are you? - What? - Yes. What is wrong? I wait endlessly for you everyday.. And go back home disheartened. So, what are you going to do today? You are there today. Who me? I am here for a stroll. You seem to be very happy. Yes. The matter has brought happiness. Let me hear it too. Someone had come home today. Who? A close relative. Really close. Had come to talk about.. My marriage, with daddy. Oh! So the things are fixed. Yes, almost. When is the wedding? Very soon. Will you come to have sweets? You will come, right? So you have decided. What could I do? I had to, being an Indian girl. Why don't you tell me who is the lucky guy? Why don't you tell me? Ask Grandma. What? Grandma! Yes. Grandma. Dear Battu. Battu! Sanjay, promise me.. You will love me like this forever. "If my love is true... then wherever you go.. I will be there for you... "Where ever I take you, I will give my life.. Whenever you call for me". "This is a strange secret and a strange thing". "This is a strange secret and a strange thing". "Our love is from the time this universe is there". "Priya, Priya". "This love will not lessen even after death". "Wherever you go, I will be there too". "If my love is true... then wherever you go I will be there for you". "Why not this sky accompanies us in our journey" "Why not this sky accompanies us in our journey" "I am with you like your shadow, I love you so much." "Now these steps will not stop." "Wherever you go, I will be there too". "If my love is true... "then wherever you go I will be there for you". Ms. Kamla Saxena is requesting you to grace.. The marriage ceremony of her grandson.. With Priya, and give them your blessings. T. K has called you for his wedding. I know what you are trying to say. But you will still be the faithful secretary for the man who.. Has discarded you like and old file for Priya. Ok! Just see what I do. Yes Rita. I have never taken any undue advantage from you.. But now I am compelled to. Even I am a human like Priya. So, are you trying to compare yourself to Priya? No! She is competing with me. Rita! The truth is always bitter. Weren't you the one to say that you will.. Never play with my emotions. How do I explain you? It wasn't me. Oh! Very good. So you are even refusing to recognise yourself. How clever? Believe me Rita. I am not T.K. He is dead. But my T.K. Is alive. Do not try to forget those days. Do not forget that we got married in Switzerland a year back. - What? - I have the marriage certificate. I have been quite till now. But now I'll tell the whole world that you are my.. Husband and I am your wife. If you still want me to be quite, then come home at 8:00 P. M.. Sharp and decide for yourself. I will wait for you. So long, my dear husband. Bye! Bye! I thought being his private secretary, should let you.. Know some of his private things, to his bride-to-be. There is nothing private between us. There is. One private secretary who has been with him.. For years and will be. I knew somebody like you would definitely come. Tell me. He has spent many nights with me. Yes. He must have. He will also be with me tonight. I am telling the truth. Can you tell a lie? I don't think so. If you wish to meet, then come searching at this address. Tonight at eight. Hello. Is T. K there? He has gone out. Where? Didn't say anything. Ok. Thank you. Greetings. Greetings. Is Rita madam there? You are standing like a stranger in your own house. All this is yours, only I am a stranger, right? Come, sit. Come. - Whisky? - No! Champagne? No, thank you. What magic has Priya done? You seem to have forgotten both, alcohol and me. Really, Rita has given up now. It is so sad. But do not take it as your victory T.K. You have sold my love and brought a doll. And now you are selling yourself.. So that you can pay her dues. Rita! Try to understand me. I am being duped in trying to understand you, T.K. You're leaving me after taking away my beautiful years. First you make me your princess.. And then you throw me like a pair of shoes. No! No! No! Rita. This is not the case. You won't understand what I was and what am I today. Nothing is in my hands, Rita. I can just say that I am trapped with a good soul.. And a bad body, and I am fighting with nature. Rita, everybody will laugh on me if I say this to anybody. I am a shadow of my past. I am searching for my being. I will be free, if I get it. Rita, you don't know how many difficulties I have faced to get Priya. Even the skies have bowed down in front of my love. Then why are you so heartless? Please have mercy and let me go. Let you go! For what? You trapped me till now. Now you are in my trap. I was waiting for this day. What will you achieve by destroying me? The amount of my destroyed life. You needed my body for pleasure and I needed your support. That is why I never married you but your wealth. Wealth! Take as much as you want. Look at this! Look at this! Here is our marriage certificate, your freedom. Thank you very much, Rita. Don't leave. I will be back. Rita, can I come in? I am sorry, Rita. You were right. Murder! Murder! Help! Help! Murder! Murder! Help! Help! Catch her. She murdered my madam. Catch her. Me! I did not do it. - Call the police immediately. - Right away! - No! No! I have not murdered her. - We will come to know now. I did not do anything. Priya! Priya! Sanjay! Priya, why did you do this? Why did you take the law in your hands? Me? Why did you kill Rita? What are you saying, Sanjay? I did not kill Rita. She was breathing her last, when I reached up. You did not kill Rita? Even I didn't kill her. Then who did? Sanjay! Daddy! My daughter. - Daddy! - Don't cry. Everything will be alright. - Sir, I suspect Prem. - It can be possible. - I will need your help. - Yes of course. Good night. Good night. Let's go home, driver. Why did you go to the jail? To see Priya. She has killed Rita. - Priya? - Priya did it? It's good, Prem. I am free now as she was a problem. Get me whisky. But sir, you had stopped drinking. Get me the whisky! Brother, will you drink in front of Grandma? I want to drink in front of her, as it is a very happy day. What? Yes! Fools, both of them destroyed themselves for me. What can be a better day for me? Battu! What are you saying? Don't shout. If you don't like all this, then you may go. You scoundrel, rascal. It would be better if I was dead. You bluff, you call yourself Sanjay. Shame on you. Wait Grandma, I am coming with you. Devilal, Devilal... you all may go too. Come. Get me whisky. Right away brother, right away. - Cheers! - Cheers! Prem, my brother, my friend, had it not been for you.. Then I don't know where would I have been. Thank you, brother. At least you called me yours. How can I forget you? We have a blood relation. Does blood ever hide. But I feel sorry for Rita. Brother, you must have gone to her place. No! That is why the killer ran away. I mean if Priya would have seen me, then Rita would have been saved. Leave all that. Today is our day. Let's bring back the old memories. Then should we start the arrangements? Arrange in a way as if it is the last day of our lives. Never before. - Cheers! - Cheers!

I won't be duped this time. Tomorrow morning the headlines will read.. T. K got burnt and died. Dear brother, I know all the duties of being a brother. Performing your last rites is one of them. I will fulfill that too. Mr. Prem, you are under arrest. Get up! Get up! Mr. Prem, stop. You go this way, you go that way. Come on, hurry up. Brother. - Tell me, why did you kill Rita? - Brother, brother. Speak, speak fast. Why did you kill Rita? Say! Say! Because of you, brother. You distributed all my hard earned money to the poor. You always considered me a dog, a scoundrel. I even tried to kill you, but you were saved. Rita too favoured you. That's the reason I killed her. I killed her! I killed her! I killed her! I hate you! I hate you! Arrest Mr. Prem. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Human, you are very lucky. Sir, you? Oh King! I am very depressed with this life.. Please free me. You have paid the debt for this body. So, now what oh king? You spend a peaceful life with your sweetheart. Go, you have our blessings. Really! Thank you so much. Sanjay, who are you talking to? With the sage, he is here. - Sage. The sage from the world above. - Yes! - Ok. Ok. Sage, sage, sage, where is he? He is here. Where? Ghost! You were again talking to a ghost. - No, Hanuman, No. - Ghost! Ghost. Come, Grandma. Sanjay, just listen. Yes. Sanjay, you gave everything in charity. When will you give my 10 rupees? I will give it when we go up. - Up, with the sage? - Yes. No! No! I am alright down here. I don't need it. Where are you going? Where there is Ram and Sita, there will be Hanuman. I am your deity, Hanuman. - Come then. - Yes! Yes! Ok! Brothers! I will be coming too.
