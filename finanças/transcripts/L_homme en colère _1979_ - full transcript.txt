¶¶¶ - How much farther? - Not far. [Distant bird call] - Where are you? Where are you?! [Distant bird call] [Engine starting] - Move it. [Large crowd noise] - [Radio]: ...facing off. And behind the net goes J.C. Tremblay. A left-wing pass, Berenson missed it, Ravlich shoots it in there. Esposito shoots it-- right in front! And, oh! Maki missed-- - Are we winning? - Two-one. - ...ahead to Richard, down with Berenson, Berenson getting in there. He fanned on it. Now it's Richard. Richard back to Harris. He shoots it in front. - No taillights. - Aha, looking for a promotion again, are ya? - Jarret shooting it down the ice for Chicago, and the Hawks will be called for icing. [Siren wailing intermittently] They've dressed Melnyk and Dennis Hall instead. For Canadiens, Gautier is the 5th defenceman. He hasn't seen any action yet. [Large crowd noises] Jarret for Chicago. Up on the right side, Maki ahead to Esposito. He's up all alone, taken out of the play. Tremblay's pass hit Hall. Here's Hall barging in on the right side to the corner. He puts on the brakes. Over to Maki... ...Berenson, over off the right-wing boards to Provost. [Gunshot] ...couldn't get by Jarret... [Bullet deflecting] [Gunshots] [Tires squealing] [Bullet deflecting] [Tires squealing] [Gunshot] [Tires squealing] [Car honking] [Cars honking] ...Cournoyer cutting in front-- he scores! [Large crowd cheering] [Loud whirring] - Good morning, sir. - [Announcement]: Air France 9603 flight from Paris: passengers may come in at Exit #4 of Canadian Customs. - [Customs officer]: Thank you, sir. - Mr. Dupré? - Yes? - Would you come along with me, please? ¶¶¶ ¶¶¶ [Tires squealing] - How did he die? - He was shot. It is not my son. It's his passport, but not his photo. - That's right. It's the dead man's. When did you last hear from your son? - Not since he left France. - He entered this country over 7 months ago. He didn't have an immigration permit, so, by rights, he should have left after 90 days. Don't you have an address for him here? - I didn't even know he was in Canada. ¶¶¶ - [Woman]: Good night, sir. - Good night. [Silence] [Police siren approaching] [Sirens] - Maman. Maman. Maman... MAMAN! [Explosion] [Shouting in French] ¶¶¶ - OK, let's go. The left. Right away. Another one. Quickly. Go on. Go on. From the shoulder. From your shoulder. From your shoulder! Go on. Let's go. Right. Leg forward. Your leg forward. Yeah. [Knocking at door] [Door opening] - [Man]: Good morning, sir. Your breakfast. - What? - You ordered it last night. - Oh, yes. Yes. - Have a good day, sir. - Thank you. [Door closing] - I'm very sorry about all this, Mr. Dupré. You must have had quite a shock. Thank you very much, Ronnie. - Do you mind if I smoke? - If you must. We've identified the dead man. His name was Luigi Lentini. We've been after him for a couple of years. Lentini. The name ring a bell? - No. - He obviously intended to use your son's passport to leave the country. Tell me, your son interested in politics? - Politics? No, not really, no. - You had no news of him, but still you weren't worried, huh? - Of course I was worried. - Why did he leave France? - Look, first you tell me my son is dead. You make me come all this way. Then you show me another man's body. Now these questions. What are you trying to do? - Mr. Dupré-- - What's it all about? Julian could have lost his passport. - Or sold it, Mr. Dupré. You have no idea where he is, hmm? This is the form that he filled out when he arrived. We've checked it, of course. The address is phoney. There's no record of him at the immigration office or at the French consulate. The handwriting, Mr. Dupré, is that your son's? - Yes. - All right, Mr. Dupré, at the time he was shot, Lentini was riding in a blue Jeep Wagoneer driven by a second man. We found it abandoned about 10 miles from the airport. - So? - The car belongs to your son. Uh, that's it. Your son bought it-- second-hand, of course-- about 3 months ago. - Somebody could have stolen it from him. - Oh, certainly. I think it's much more likely that he was driving it. It's all right. There were no bloodstains inside the car. This was the gun that Lentini used to kill the policeman. That same evening, in some woods just inside the Canadian border, another man was killed-- an American. This same gun killed him too. These tracks were found a couple of hundred yards away from where the man was killed. - What are you trying to tell me? - I'm telling you 2 men have been killed, one of them a policeman. These tracks are from the Jeep Wagoneer, your son's car, Mr. Dupré. [Lighter clicks] Do you have a photograph of him? - Well, I've got one, but, uh... - May I see it? Thank you. Don't you have anything a little more recent? - No. - This is your wife, hmm? Have you mentioned any of all this to her? - She died 10 years ago. - I'm sorry. I believe you're a pilot? - Not anymore. My, uh, my eyes. - But you have flown over Canada, hmm? - Often, yes. - Good, then you'll understand what I'm saying. Five thousand miles of border. Now, in Canada, we've got more than our share of illegal immigrants from all over the world, which greatly annoys us. A lot of them sneak over the border into the United States, which greatly annoys them. Your son is an illegal immigrant. Mr. Dupré, I need to talk to your boy. I hope that he'll get in touch with you, and that you'll tell him to get in touch with me. What are your plans now? [Dupré sighs] - I think, uh, I'll be staying for a while. - Good, I was going to ask you to. [Kids shouting at once] [Dog barking] - [Driver]: Here we are, sir. - Is this Chatham Avenue? - Yeah. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. - But there are no houses. - You're right. If there were some, there are not many left. - Tell me... - Yeah? - Do you know any places where boxers train? - You mean a gym? [Bags being punched] - Why don't you try-- [Motorcycles revving] [Siren] ¶¶¶ [Jazz] ¶¶¶ ¶¶¶ [Disco] - How come you ask me? - He said you might know him. - Oh, he's got a big mouth. - Do you? - Yeah, I know a kid with a scar on his arm, yeah. - His left arm. A burn. - Yeah, he used to pick up the odd buck sparring. - Where can I find him? - Ain't like me. You know how much the crook who runs this turkey trap gives us? Ten bucks. Huh? Ten lousy bucks for going 3 rounds with some jive mother twice your size. Ten? Phew... Get it, mister? - I get it. - The kid you're asking about... He busted his arm about... 3 months ago. - Just tell me where to find him. - Well, what do you want from me? He didn't come in no more. After he busted his arm? Pff... - That's not much for $20, hmm? - Hah. Boohoo. Maybe you'd better go ask Borke. - Borke? - Uh-huh. He used to spar with him. - [Kid]: Pow! - [Kid]: Pow! - Kipper Borke? - Two. - [Woman]: ...you're driving me crazy! - Anybody home? - What do you want? - I'm looking for Kipper Borke's apartment. - He doesn't live here anymore. - Do you know where I can find him? - I don't know where he is and I don't want to know, all right? Now will you please get out of here? - Listen, I'm Romain Dupré. I'm trying to find my son, a Frenchman. He used to train with Borke. Maybe... maybe you knew him? Please. Don't worry. If you know something... [Engine at high speed] [Crash!] [Pinball machines and other game sounds] - Stop hitting my targets! - Kipper Borke? - Who wants to know? - I'm here about Julian. - Who? - Julian Dupré. - Don't know him. Turkey! Who sent ya? - Nancy. - Don't know her. - She knows you. - You a cop? - No, I am Julian's father. - You're too much, man. [Pinball machine being struck] Easy, easy, easy. - All right, All right. Don't worry about it. - But you used to box with him. - Me? - Yes, at the gym. - You've got to be kidding. I've never even been near a ring. - What's the hassle? - This creep is asking me a lot of questions. - This ain't the place. I'm trying to run a business here. Please leave quietly. Settle your accounts elsewhere. [Knocking at door] - Who is it? - [Borke]: It's me. - Get lost. - [Borke]: Open up! [Knocking louder] Just for a minute. - I told you not to come around here. - Listen, uh, um... We should talk. - OK, so I'm listening. - No, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on. Let me in. Let me in. What the hell are you doing throwing my name around like that?! Who is this guy that went down to the arc-- Ugh! - So you don't know her, huh? Where is Julian? - I don't know. I-I don't know! - When did you see him last? - Maybe a month ago. - Where? - The arcade. He said he needed bread. I gave him some. A couple of hundred. It was all I had. - It was all we had. - Well, he needed it. - What's he been doing since he got here? - [Borke]: Delivering. - Delivering what? - Hash, coke, junk. It's the shits when you first get here. You're a foreigner. No money, no work permit, so... ...you take anything worthy, don't ask questions. He told me he wanted to stop. He tried, but, uh, he needed a car, so he borrowed the money. Finish. Tilt. Loan sharks. You know? Five percent a day. When he couldn't keep up, they reminded him. Broke his arm. - Who did it? Who? - I don't know. Look... I have a job now. I am trying to stay clean. She's gonna have the kid. - Try The Musical. - Hey... - What's that? - A club. - Who do you know there? Don't worry. I won't say where I got the name. - There's a guy behind the bar. Peter. - OK, let's go. - What? - You're not staying here. Come on. - No. He stays. [Dupré handling paper] - Please. Your 200. - Thank you. [Dupré walking away] [Vehicle passing by] ¶¶¶ [Woman singing inside] - Yes? - I'm a friend of Peter's. - What? - The bartender. - This is a private club. Do you have a membership card? - No, I've just come from Paris.

What can I do for you? - Bourbon. - On the rocks? - Is the manager in? - Yeah, but he's busy right now. ¶¶¶ - ¶ Because of you ¶ ¶ I'm starting all over ¶ ¶ As if I'd been reborn ¶ ¶ All over now ¶ ¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶¶ ¶¶¶ [Disco] - Yeah? Mm-hmm. [Man and woman talking] - [Woman]: Well, I wasn't going to... He's a jerk. - [Man]: Yes, he is. He's a terrible-- - [Woman laughing]: You are! - [Man]: He is. He's a terrible man. [Woman laughing] - [Man]: Looking for something? - [Dupré]: Someone. - But can we help you? - Maybe. I'm looking for a young man called Julian Dupré. - Um... who told you to ask for him here? - A friend of Luigi Lentini. - Julian Dupré? Uh, Lentini? I'd like to help you, but, uh... - A few weeks ago, he had a plaster. - A plaster? - Yeah, uh, how do you call it, a... ...a cast. Somebody broke his arm. - Somebody? - Remember him now? - Um, could I ask you, uh, why are you looking for this young man? - I have to see him. - We don't know him. - I was told he worked here. - I'm afraid you've been misinformed. Let me give you a piece of advice. Look somewhere else. Now, if don't mind, uh, we are busy here. Eddie, show this gentleman to the door. Good night. ¶¶¶ [Disco] - ¶¶ Cars ¶ ¶ Cruising against the light (light light light light) ¶ ¶ I'm ¶ ¶ Moving through the night (night night night night) ¶¶ [Footsteps rapidly approaching] [Dupré yells] - Oof! [Dupré groans] - Get rid of him. - I'm gonna give this dude a little ride. [Vehicles approaching] [Tires squealing] - Looks like he got a wrong number. - [Man]: It's the guy in the middle. [Projector changing slides] - [Man]: We're still trying to identify the man with him. - He was in charge of accounts. They called him "the treasurer". - [Man]: Why would a man that important cross the border the way he did? - Want to answer that, Phil? - From what we found out in Detroit, he was into smuggling illegals. It fits in. We think he was carrying something. - What? - More than money. - Campana. A syndicate heavyweight. The man with the cigar is Castaldi. He's the #2 man in the Cleveland organization. [Phone buzzing] The one on the right is Murphy. - It's for you, sir. - Excuse me. MacKenzie. What? Well, I'm glad you didn't hold him all night. He told you to phone me? I see. Has he any idea who beat him up? And where did it happen? Uh-huh. OK, now, listen. Don't tell him that you've been in touch with me. Just let him go. Do you understand? - Absolutely, sir. - And send his statement over to me as soon as possible. - Right, sir. - Thank you. This is MacKenzie. Who have we got available for special duty? Right. Send him right down to my office. Well, looks as though the Frenchman's beginning to stir them up. [Telephone ringing] - Would you be kind enough to read this and sign it at the bottom, Mr. Dupré? - Did you reach MacKenzie? - I'm sorry, sir. The superintendent's not expected in today. - Oh, I see. - What do you mean, not before 5 o'clock? - Don't complain. It usually takes at least 2 or 3 days. - Oh, my God. - Would you like to file a complaint? - Would it do any good? - Not without witnesses. - [Woman]: It's upstairs? - [Officer]: No, he's just right here. - Uh, you the cop I should see about my car? - Is yours the blue Dart? - Oh, yes. It's blue, all right. And just a few hours ago it was in perfect condition. I am sure you don't have the slightest idea what son of a bitch kicked in the rear end. - Me. - You? - I'd like to tell you exactly-- - Please, no, don't give me any of your long, sad stories. What are you going to do about him? - There is nothing I can do, ma'am-- - Nothing? - You see, it's-- - Oh, you're damn right I see. - Would you let me explain? - Some turkey can take a car that doesn't even belong to him, run it around, smash it to pieces, play demolition derby all night, and just walk away, right? - It's not-- - You're not going to do a thing about it, right? Well, don't just stand there. Go ahead and tell me. You're not going to do a damn thing. Right?! - May I leave now? - Whenever you want, sir. - Thank you. - You're letting him go? - Uh, yes. - I would just like to know one thing, uh, Sergeant: what are you here for? [Bus pulling to a stop] Excuse me. - Excuse me. Does this bus go to Dominion Square? - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not from here. - Ah. - Wait a minute. Excuse me, miss? Does this bus go to Dominion Square? - Sorry, I don't have the slightest idea. Usually I drive my own car. - Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am. Look, I'm really sorry about your car, but I-- - It's OK. I know about it now. Excuse me. I'm kind of in a hurry. - Is this a good restaurant? - No. ¶¶¶ - This way, please. May I take your coat? - Yes. - I hope you enjoy your lunch, sir. - Thank you. [Woman laughing] - [Man]: Waitress, could we have the cheque, please? - Thank you. [Woman laughing] - Miss? Miss, can you please take this steak back? I asked for a bone. Thank you very much. [Woman laughing] [Woman laughing] - Oh! Your glass-- - Are you trying to say it's my fault?! Look at this! Look what she did to my suit! I want to see the manager! Even in a restaurant like this I expect waitresses who know how to wait on a table! - Now, go and get some hot water. Don't just stand there like an idiot! - [Man]: Cold water for spaghetti sauce. And quick! - What is wrong with you?! - Everything. - Jack! - Where do you think you're going, Karen? - Hungry? - Yes. - I don't think there is too much damage to your car. - I know. But yelling about it makes me feel better. - Beef or chicken? The chicken's better. - Beef. You have to take a chance sometimes, don't you? - I'm sorry about just now. I started your day off badly. - Forget it. I was looking for an excuse to quit anyhow. Coffee? - Please. How long were you working there? - Since yesterday. - And before that? - I was in Chicago. - American? - French-Canadian? - French. - I've never been to Paris. Does it show? It's easier to talk to a person when you know their name, don't you think? - Sure. - I'm Karen. It isn't a state secret, is it? - What? - Your name. - No. Romain Dupré. - That's nice. Why were you beaten up last night? Are you some kind of dangerous character? - No. - What are you doing in Canada? - Looking for my son. - You don't know where he is? - Maybe somewhere in this city. Maybe not. - Well, how did you happen to lose track of him? Is he in... is he in some trouble? Don't want to talk about it? - And you? Why are you here? - Me? I was born in Pennsylvania, I majored in sociology at the University of Maryland. I got married, then I got divorced. I'm giving you the short version. My husband had a better lawyer than I did, so after the divorce, I, I, uh, I went to work. - As a waitress? - No, no. No, that was my first try at that. Couldn't you tell? No, I've done, uh... Well, I've done lots of things. I was a, I was a librarian for a while--2 years-- in Chicago. And then I went back to college. - Still, uh, sociology? - Yes, well, sort of. I, um... I've always been interested in the urban personality. - Oh, I see. - Aggression; uh, anonymity; faceless crowds; uh, how, uh, how people react as individuals, uh, or in groups; loneliness. I-I came here to do, um, research. You don't believe me, do you? Why are you listening if you don't believe what I say? - You're not eating? - Well, I'm not very hungry. Well, home. Thank you for the ride. - Of course. - And you were right not to believe what I told you. Most of it was a lot of garbage. Well, not all of it. I really was a librarian for 2 years. A place called The Dwight Correctional Institute for Women-- a prison. Wanna know why I was there? - No. Let's go. Seven oh nine, please. Thank you. - Uh, Mr. Dupré? - Yes? - There's someone waiting for you in the lobby, sir. Just around the corner there. - For me? - Yes. - Ah, you are, perhaps, Mr. Dupré? - Yes. - I am Albert Rumpelmayer. I keep a laundry just around the corner from Vince's Gymnasium. They told me at the gym that you're looking for your son. - Yes, that's right, yes. - And you still have not found him? He, uh, left this with me 3 weeks ago. And never came back for it. - What is it? - It's his laundry. - His laundry? - Oh, you need them too. Me, I should wear these all the time, but, uh, vanity has no respect of age. Or appearance. It's, uh... [Handling paper] Nineteen dollars and fifty cents. It is so much because he did not pay me for some other times. It's your son's laundry, all right. You can be sure of that. [Chuckling]: Yes. Very pretty. Very pretty girl. She is a student, as you see. A player of, uh, volleyball. - She? - Your son's girlfriend. They often came to my laundry together. She is clever. Clever, too, as well as pretty. Your son is a very lucky man. - Do you know her name? - Anne. I remember he called her that once. I remember it because it was a pretty name to match a pretty girl. - Anne what? - Anne... I don't know. Anne. [Elevator dings] - And you haven't seen her since-- - So lucky... I haven't been. - That's all right. - I do thank you, sir. I, uh... Oh. I sincerely hope that you, uh, find your son. - Excuse me. Can you have this sent up to my room, please? - Certainly, sir. - Seven oh nine. - Thank you. - Thank you. - OK, it's coming over. - Go, go, go, go, go. Come on. [Laughing] - She hasn't been here for a while. I have no idea why. What do you want with her? - Nothing. I'm just in town for a couple of days, and I'd like to see her. - All right, dig for the ball. Come on, Helen. Did you go to her place? - No. I was told I might find her here, but, uh, I don't have her address. - Are you a relative? - Yes. - Relax your fingers! OK, spike it! Spike it! All right, you can get her address up at the office over there. - Thank you. - You're not the only one who's been asking for her, you know. Hold your positions! Watch it-- Hold your positions, please! [Whistle blown] Come on, keep it going! It's going now. Keep it going. [Saxophone being played] [Phone off the hook beeping] [Phone beeping continuously] [Saxophone being played in another room] [Beeping stops] [Saxophone stops] [Saxophone resumes] [Dial tone] - Montreal Forum. May I help you? ¶¶¶ [Brass band] - [Announcer]: Welcome to the Montreal Forum... [Music continues inside] - Please, where can I find Anne Garret? - Who? - Anne Garret. She works here. - Ask the guy at the turnstile. Next. - Where can I find Anne Garret? - Concession stand, second floor. - Thanks. - Ticket, please, sir. - Oh, yes. - Mister? Wanna buy a ticket? Twenty bucks. [Crowd cheering] - Please, can you tell me where I can find Anne Garret? - She's up there on the south balcony. [Crowd cheering] [Whistle blown] - [Woman]: Go, Canadiens! - [Man]: That a boy! Hey! - Anne Garret? I'm Julian's father. - ...and the other night-- it was late-- I-I hadn't seen him for days, and all of a sudden he showed up like... crazy, freaked out. - But... what had happened? - He wouldn't tell me. He, uh, he just said, "Come on, come on! We're getting out of here right now". I didn't know what he was talking about. How he... - Where did he want to go? - California. - California? - We'd been planning to go. I wanted to finish my degree there. But to leave like this? In a flap in the middle of the night? I... - Anne, I'm taking off. Ted got here early. Cover for me, will ya? - Oh, yeah, Cathy. - Hey, what's wrong? - Oh, it's OK. - You sure? - Sure. - OK, thanks. - I met him very soon after he got here. He didn't have a job, but he kept trying to get one. He made a little here, a little there. Never enough. He was ashamed of being broke. Then he got in with them. - Them? - We split up once. But we were both miserable. When we got back together, he tried to get out of what he was doing. They wouldn't let him. He owed too much money. He had to work for them. - Doing what? Doing what? - I think he's ferrying at the moment. - Ferrying? - People. Across the border. I told him he should write you. He wouldn't. What goes on with you two? - But the other night... - He left. Since then, he phones every day. He says he's waiting for me. He won't go without me. I tell him it's no use. And now... - What? - I don't know what's happening. I'm scared to death. When I came up the stairs last night, I saw light under the door of my apartment. I could hear noises-- things being thrown around, men's voices. I ran away. - Where to? - A girlfriend's. I've told Julian where. ¶¶¶ [Brass band] I'm gonna lose my job. I have a phone number where I can reach him any day at noon. - Where is it? - It's a public phone booth: 555-2010. - Just a moment. Five five five... - Two oh one oh. - Have you called him there? - No. And I won't. You and I, we're the only ones he's got. If you do talk to him. tell him-- - Yes. Where can I get in touch with you? - I don't want to tell you. No. ¶¶¶ [Brass band] - [Man]: Mr. Dupré. Mr. Dupré, would you come over here a minute, please? Uh, will you get in, please? I want to talk to you. It's about your son. I wasn't expecting you so soon. You didn't enjoy the game? - What about my son? - We have a lot to talk about. There isn't much time. I was right about the girl, wasn't I? Anne. She is lovely. You saw her, didn't you? Did she tell you? - Tell me what? - Where your son is. - Who are you? - Mr. Dupré, the people who are looking for your son, they don't want to make this girl talk. Uh, but, if they have to... You understand what I mean? - Which people? - Mr. Dupré, be reasonable. They are. They don't enjoy violence. - What exactly do you do? - I'm only a negotiator, for my knowledge is limited. I can tell you one thing. Your son has made a mistake. Made a big mistake. He should not have taken what did not belong to him. - What did he take? - Property. - What property? - Your son is in grave danger. You should, uh, you should tell him that. He should understand that the property he has taken-- - What the hell are you talking about? - If it should happen to fall in the hands of the police, Mr. Dupré-- if that should happen, your son-- This young girl... she did, uh, tell you where he is? Of course she did. - No. - Ten minutes. That's all they gave me. - What do you mean? - Mr. Dupré, you did ask her! - I asked. She doesn't know! - They'll never believe that, Mr. Dupré. Never. [Tires squealing] [Tires squealing] [Tires squealing] [Tires squealing] [Fans blowing loudly] [Grunting in pain] [Wrench hits the ground] - Oof! [Yelling from above] [Groaning in pain] - [Dupré]: Ugh! [Dupré grunting in pain] [Alarm bell ringing] - [Man]: Come on! Let's get out of here. [Alarm bell ringing] [Alarm bell ringing continuously] [Alarm bell ringing inside] [Telephone ringing] [Telephone ringing] - Hello? When are you gonna set your watch to Canadian time? What? Where? - [Dupré]: Each time I was away it separated us a little more. We didn't understand each other anymore. Apart from boxing and playing poker, nothing else interested him, and I had to pay his gambling debts. [Laughing] ¶¶¶ [Jazz piano music] - Attention, hut! - [Dupré]: Yes, I have often tried to talk with him. It was useless. One evening, he said to me that if I had been there the day of the fire, his mother wouldn't have died. [Slap] And that, I couldn't accept. That was the last time I saw him. - Words. Sometimes they're too much. Sometimes not enough. I can guess how he felt when he left Paris. When he got here, what it was like. A foreigner in a strange country. Alone. [Striking matches] It can happen. You start to believe nobody gives a damn, you get tired of fighting. One day, well, one day you do something stupid. From then on it's all downhill. [She sighs] Are you feeling better? - Yes, thank you. - Why did you call me instead of the police? [He sighs] - Because I want to find Julian before they do. - And Anne? What are you gonna do about Anne? - I don't know. She refused to tell me where she was staying. And I don't know what I can do. - Well... ...we can't do anything until morning. Tonight, you stay here. OK. You know something, this is the first time in over 2 years I've spent the night with a man. Somehow I figured it would be different. How do you always manage to make me feel shy? I'm not like that. - Good morning. - You feel much better? - Yes, thanks. - I found the phone booth. It's at the corner of St. Denis and Mont-Royal. - Is that far from here? - No, it's just a few miles. They thought I was your wife. It seems women don't buy shirts for their lovers. - Thank you. - You know, if I were you, I'd change hotels as long as they know where you're stay-- [Knocking at door] - What time are you checking out, madam? - I'm not. - The office said you were leaving. - I was. I've changed my mind, OK? - Sure. But you better tell them. - Thanks. [Door closing] - I'm checking out. - Your room number, please? - Seven oh nine. - Could someone take my bag, please? - Of course, sir. [He snaps his fingers] Front. Take the gentleman's bags, please. - Yes, uh, would you take it to the blue car waiting outside, please? - Yes, sir. Thank you, madam. - Taxi, sir? - Please. - Where are you going, sir? - St. Denis and Mont-Royal. - [Valet]: St. Denis and Mont-Royal. [Car starting] - Where's he going? - St. Denis and Mont-Royal. - Good day, sir. Would you like to see the menu? - Just a coffee, please. ¶¶¶ [Stereo] [Dialling] [Ring tone] - Hello, Julian. It's me, Father. Julian, I'm in the restaurant just across the street. Listen, I've got to talk to you-- ¶¶¶ [Stereo] - Coffee. Your father can't talk to you now. Don't hang around here. Call him as soon as you can. Room 109. ¶¶¶ [Stereo] - I want to see MacKenzie. [Birds singing] - How about some tea? - No, thank you. - How did you get that? - You're counting on me to find him, huh? Or you're counting on him to find... - Have you seen him? - Not yet, no. - But you think you will. - Not if you keep having me followed. - What'll you do when you find him? - Bring him to you. After I've had the chance to talk to him alone. - Why after? Look, Monsieur Dupré... I'm gonna have some very hard questions for your son. You know that. But what's much more important right now is that he's in possession of something which is all too damned important to some very dangerous people. Do you understand me? For his sake, I hope he comes to us before they get to him. - Stop having me followed. - I suppose the only guarantee I have is your word, hmm? - Yes. - I can give you 48 hours. [Telephone ringing] - Hello? Oh, hi. He phoned 10 minutes ago. No, he said he couldn't come here, but he'll meet you at 8 this evening in front of the Palace Theatre. [Siren in the distance] - Well, Julian. Is this where you live? - You've seen Anne? - Yes. - What'd she say? - Julian, listen. You've got to stop all this. If not, don't count on Anne. Get out now. How far do you think you can get? Everybody's after you. - Did you come all this way just to tell me that? - No, I came all this way because they told me my son was dead. What happened that night with Lentini? Were you driving the car? - I didn't shoot the cop. - And the other man? - What other man? - The one killed at the border the same night with the same gun. - Bastard. [Car starting] - Move it. - We're not taking anybody tonight? - Just this. Get us outta here. Take the autoroute. - Where are we going? - Mirabel Airport. - What for? - Shut up and drive. - [Police car radio]: ...at the line. He shoots... - Keep going. [Police siren] What the hell do they want? - I don't know. - Hey, easy, easy. OK, pull over. - [Police car radio]: ...facing off. And behind the net goes J.C. Tremblay. - Great. What are we gonna do? - Get ready to move it. - ...shoots it--right in front! And, oh! - Are you crazy?! [Gunshots] [Bullet deflecting] [Cars honking] [Tires squealing] [Vehicle approaching] [Tires squealing] So this is my big break. Nobody's gonna take it away from me. - You call that a break? - With this money, Anne and I are going to California. - No. Not Anne. Not like that. Julian, I told the police you'll turn yourself in. Believe me, it's... your only way out. - I don't want to go to jail. - Do you think I want to see you there? - Do you really want to help me? I can't hold out any longer. I've got to get out of here. But not without Anne. If you... could only talk to her. I mean, if it came from you, she'd understand. Here's the place where you can reach her. Tell her I'll be waiting tomorrow at 10 in front of the train station at Magog. It's near the border. It's the last thing I'll ever ask of you. - Julian, for the last time, come back with me. Hello, Karen. - You didn't manage to convince him. Maybe he's right. Maybe he would have more of a chance somewhere else. - No. - No? Just like that? OK, suppose he doesn't run, gives himself up. Then what? Did you think about that? Did you really stop and think? OK, so they toss him in jail. You think, you think that solves everything-- or anything, for that matter? He does his time; they let him out. No job, no money, he's right back where he was before. - At least he'll be alive. - You think that matters if you don't know what you're living for? [Telephone ringing] - [Dupré]: Hello? - [Woman]: This is 288-0119. Please don't hang up. I'm not in right now, but I will be back at 6 o'clock. If you wish to leave a message, please wait till you hear the tone, then leave your name, number, and the time I can reach you. I will call you as soon as possible. Thank you. [Message tone] - [Woman]: Miss Garret... Oh, God... - [Karen]: Nothing? Shall we? That's her, isn't it? - Let's go to the hospital. [Ambulance siren] - Two minutes. No longer. - Anne. You know who I am? I've seen Julian. He'll come back. I promise you. - [Nurse]: I'm sorry, but you have to go. - If you still want him to. - [Karen]: You, uh... ...you wouldn't want me to drive you to Magog? - [Dupré]: No, Karen, no. - [Karen]: It's because of the risk, is that it? - [Dupré]: That's right. - I'll go see Anne in the hospital. - Thanks, Karen. Thanks for everything. - Already... I'll miss you. - Get me Borke first, will you? - Borke? To your right, please. - Which gate? - Twenty. Where are you going to, sir? - Same place as my friend there. - Magog? - Yeah, Magog. - [Announcement]: Connection for Canadian Pacific Railways by bus: Gate #4. - Train stations always make me sad, but I still like them anyway. I know this sounds silly... You will take care? - Excuse me, please. - Romain, should I wait for you? - [Man]: All aboard! - I'd like that, Karen. Yes. - You'd better go. I don't suppose you're the kind of man who'd kiss a girl on a station platform? - No. - [Announcement]: Departure for Burlington, Albany, and New York: Platform #14. - Operator, please get me the police. It's urgent. Please hurry. Hello, police. This is very im-- - Police! Hold it! - Which line? - Line 4, sir. They picked up Freddy at the station. - Hmm. MacKenzie. Yeah, how'd it happen? Well, bring her in fast. Did Parker get the train? OK. Yeah, right. Advise the Magog local police to give me a call. I'm going over to Provincial Control. I'll be there in 2 minutes. - X-365 calling Magog Police Force. Over. [Printers and faxes buzzing and beeping] [Muted talking] [Railroad crossing bell] - [Julian]: What's wrong? You didn't see her? - Yes, I saw her. - Why didn't she come? - She's in the hospital. - The hospital? - In bad shape. - What happened? - They tried to make her talk. Julian. Come back with me. It's not too late. - I've been followed. - Of course not. - Look over there. You brought them here. [Van starting] [Printers and faxes buzzing and beeping] - [Man]: I've alerted the Vermont police. [Others talking] [Birds singing] - Julian! Julian, listen! Julian! - [Man]: Parker's on the way. The Magog Police have... - [Man]: What are they sending? - [Man]: Four cars... [Tapping on glass] - Good work. Maintain contact. Let us know what's happening. - What do you want? Anne, or the money? - I want both. - Julian. Anne wants no part of that money. Can you understand that? - Go to hell! - Give me that bag! [Slap] [Punch] [Slap] [Punches] Julian, stop it! Julian! Julian. - Parker here. We found Dupré's van. The 2 limos are there too. [Birds singing] [Birds singing] [Gunshot] [Gunshots] [Gunshots] [Gunshots] - Police! Freeze! [Gunshot] [Gunshot] - We've made contact. We don't know yet. [Gunshot] [Gunshot] ¶¶¶ - Yeah, they're both there. You'd better call an ambulance, sir, get the first aid up here. - Who's injured? - Well, the father's injured. - Does he have a bag with him? - The kid's carrying a bag. - Ten-four. Parker here. Operation successfully completed. We've got the bag. Found Dupré and his son. Dupré is injured. - Yeah, but not badly, huh? Not too serious. Good. Um, well, get back to me as soon as the bag's turned over to you, all right? OK. - Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Are they... ...are they all right? - Yes, they're all right. Dupré had a minor injury. - Will I be able to see him? - Probably. It might take some time, though. - It's all right. I'll wait. ¶¶¶
