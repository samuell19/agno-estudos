Mademoiselle, can I help you? What do you want? Irina. Island of Madeira, 22nd of February, 1974, Today is the 22nd of February, and after only a few hours of my being in Madeira I have killed a man. I honestly wish an end would come to this bloody race that am forced to run through the ages. Alas, I am a prisoner of the curse that weighs heavily on the Karisteins. I am hellishly influenced by forces to commit these heinous crimes., There on the green hilly island, in the very place where scientists located Atlantis, you will perhaps find the answers to the many questions that so far have eluded us and which today more then ever concern us and worry us - if it's there on the summit of the volcanic mountains that the cycle closes and that the living find the men of the other world. Excuse me, madam. I'm a journalist. I hope that you will grant me an interview. I won't take much of your time. You just need to answer yes or no. First, I'd like to inform you that the story I am going to write for this interview will appear in all the major newspapers and magazines of Europe and America. I won't waste much of your time because I have prepared the questions in advance. I know that you are mute, but I also know that you can hear very well. You are the Countess Irina Karlstein? I know that you are not married and have no children. Do you wish to have some? So you want to be the last descendant of the Karlstein family? Is the man that accompanies you from the same country as you? And he is mute too, isn't he? Do you think that this affliction is the consequence of the curse that has weighed on your family for centuries? You are no doubt aware of the bloody reputation of your ancestors. Your smile makes me think that you approve of what they did. Do you feel you would be at ease being the descendant of a family of vampires? It seems that there is a lovely big house of yours on this island. On the mountain. Did you inherit that house from your ancestors? From the first count of Karlstein, I presume. They say he committed some of his crimes on this island. Do you know something about those murders? What, a crime? The first ones. Your return here is rather worrying. Isn't it said that a criminal always returns to the scene of the crime? Are you aware of a very strange crime committed last night? It is a very difficult case for the investigators. The murderer did not leave any clues. Traces of his footprints were found, but after a few yards they stopped, as if the murderer had flown away or vanished into thin air. Did you hear about it? It's time for me to leave. I don't want to impose on you. Thank you for your kindness. Good-bye, Countess Karlstein. See you soon, I hope. And if you find yourself on a mountain, wandering amid the flowing mist, you will hear unknown voices lost in the fog that run down the mountainside. Wake up! Wake up! You are marked forever by meeting me. You'll never forget me again. Wake up, Anna! Anna. - Good evening, Inspector. - Good evening, Dr. Roberts. - Have a seat. - I just finished the autopsy. Is that why you look so tired? Yes, it's a horrible thing. Horror of the autopsy or of the corpse? It's more the autopsy, a dirty job. But I have a little surprise this time. - Isn't he dead? - You're in a joking mood today. He was killed by a mouth. And I'm supposed to be the funny one. Admit that you joke as much as me. He was bitten in the middle of an orgasm, and the vampire sucked his semen and took his life away. Come on. You're not going to tell me you believe in vampires. Isn't it the work of a madman, of a sadist? Believe what you want. I refuse to discuss it with you. You could not possibly understand anyway. Here's my report. Good-bye, Inspector. - Dr. Roberts. -Yes? Your thoughts verge a little too much on the fantastic. It's a pity. You on the contrary have no imagination. That's a pity. Good-bye. Countess Karlstein? Excuse me. It's your secretary. He told me to come up. You're in need of my services? Irina. Good evening, Dr. Orloff. I am Dr. Roberts. I hope I'm not disturbing you. Not at all, Dr. Roberts. I hadn't heard of you, but your voice reminds me of someone. I believe I knew you when you were a small child. Your father was my best friend and also my best teacher. I have come for a consultation. I know that you have inherited his genius. I search, and sometimes in the darkness I find the answer that in the light one cannot find. And don't you have the impression that the shadows on this island are closer to one than anywhere else? I have this feeling, and I live here too. Yes, you are quite right. It's a strange place. That's why I have elected to live here. I have a strange impression that a crowd surrounds me night and day - a crowd surrounded by strange inspiration, an immense crowd, yet there are only a few thousand inhabitants on all of the island. Dr. Roberts, the shadows are there, touching us. Can I ask you what you are waiting for and what you are seeking on this island? The sources of good and evil. The power of evil will be awakened. And so the circle will close. Do you know the beautiful Countess Karlstein? I often feel her presence as of late. Is she alive? Are you alive? In Madeira there have been some ghastly cases of vampirism, and I feel that she did it. I have found in the early books of Pantos writings on the Countess Karlstein and on those murders. According to Pantos, she sucks the body of her victims and feeds on the hormones. That's all I know. I think you can't expect more from me, Dr. Roberts. You must reach your own conclusions. Anna. Why does my body yearn again with desire for death? Why can't my senses survive without the last breath of the victim? Why has my soul so much the need of peace and love when it can't obtain it? The woman put a hole in the belly of this toy here, and that's how for months the drug passed the frontier. The good woman! I must say it was a good idea. Inspector, I'd like to talk to you. Sit down, please. - Look how sexy this position is. - Leave us. We have to talk. I was only joking. I'm listening now. I'd like to know where you stand with your investigations. Have you gotten your hands on this sadist, I mean the murderer who killed with his mouth? No. Not yet, but it should not be long now. I doubt it. The police aren't enough. As I already told you, it can't be someone normal. I'm well aware that your ideas and mine are running parallel. What do you mean? Well, parallel lines never join up together. If you're saying that lines will never meet, I have to continue my search alone to be able to find out the truth. Good advice. Go and see a good doctor, a psychiatrist. I cannot help you. You can listen. I'm quite sane, and I say that this murder is surrounded by a mystery not easy to elucidate. When someday your hunches become so strong that they press as certitude does, when the unknown becomes familiar, when the noise of rumbling wings becomes deafening to the point that your head is full to bursting, then you will achieve serenity... suddenly. Deep silence will reign all around you. It's from those signs that you will recognize the supreme moment. Then you will know that you have passed through the gate to the world of great mystery. That world to which all of us aspire. Are you the Countess Karlstein? We have already met, haven't we? May I sit down, please? I'm finishing reading a very strange and interesting book. I've learned many things about the island. The author believes it's a meeting place for ghostly spirits who populate a mysterious world. But tell me... you're not a ghost, one of those strange beings gifted with magic powers? I've been to the summits of those mysterious mountains. The atmosphere is really different. Don't you think so? Are you from there? Will you take me with you one day, behind the mist? I was waiting for you. Thanks for coming. Follow me, please. Here, my special guests always sign the golden book. Here is the previous visitor. Maria. Her skin is so silky I can't bear to touch it. Continue. Continue. What are you doing? Maria, have you gone crazy? Why? Why? Irina! “She appeared for a moment as a shadow, a white uncertain shape. Soon she was near me. As she was approaching, that half of her body seemed to become more and more unreal. And so in the fog, the contours of her face slowly became fuzzy and indistinct. My eyes looked up to hers, but deep was my surprise... because I found a world of peace.” That's what I wrote before I'd ever met you or loved you. It must be destiny. Good evening, Dr. Roberts. The two canine teeth pierced the clitoris. This is what the first vampires did. They took all their victims' energy and drew all the blood. It's what Pantos wrote in his accounts. What you say is more than terrifying. The demons must be killed, never to rise again. What for? How are we to know that the pleasure felt by the victims isn't worth their life? Why fight against it? It's quite useless. They are out of reach. Leave them to me - in the deep silence that surrounds me. I'm no longer alone. It's a new world because I no longer need eyes to see to discover the life - the only one. Roberts. Believe me, your prejudice is blinding you to a world of wonders. It's up to you to become a part of it. What a strange house. It looks like a tomb. Is it the house of your ancestors? Play. I know who you are. And I understand your hesitation in asking me here. You feel sorry for me, but it's a hateful feeling. I know it happens to be true, but I don't want your pity... because I want to stay with you, do you understand? I want to be near you, to go with you. My life is not important. I don't want to be alone. Even if I had not known you, I would have left this world. Why? Why? Yes, why? All this never-ending time, the hours of sorrow, pleasure, solitude and sudden fear in the cold coffin lost deep down in the mausoleum. My implacable destiny led me to a wonderful being, who has also become a victim. I have been his judge and his involuntary executioner, for nothing can stop the march of destiny. Who is there? Who is there? Yes, I know who you are. Your mysterious world has no more secrets for me. I can sense... your desire. I can hear your voice. It says - Yes, it says, “The powers of darkness have won again. Another man has died tonight. I, Irina Karlstein, will now act in order to make their powers disappear. I have come, Dr. Orloff, because I want you to give my message to humanity... that all vampires at my call will return to the shadows, once more... to the world of darkness, so as to put an end... to nightmares of phantasms and vampires.” The Countess Irina Karlstein. I would like to talk to her. I want to see her! Irina!
