I thought I'd done something wrong, that it was my fault, that everyone was judging me. And I just hated myself. I made my sister cry. Where did you get this? I made these, I gave one to Zoe. Angie, this is Zoe. I just wanna know that she's okay. Was she with you? Angie? Please Angie. Can we go? What happened? I'm so sorry. I'm Latisha. This is a good place. She can help you.

She doesn't even know who I am anymore. I just hate them all so much right now. It's all right, things will get better. I promise. Get your hands off of her! It's okay, this is Luke, just my friend. They moved up across the street. You don't know that, get inside. I'm gonna go now. Why would you do that? You were so rude! Why do you think he's hanging out with you? Just because you were stupid doesn't mean that I am! There is literally no one more stupid than you. Okay, I'll be back to pick you up in an hour. I love you. For those of you who are new, if you don't love yourself right now, we're gonna love you till you do. Here we share experience, strength and hope with each other here, to help with recovery. What is shared here, it stays here. Let's begin with a prayer ladies. God, grant us the serenity and the faith to put the past behind us, and to have the courage to believe in the infinite possibilities for the future. Okay, ladies, let's have a seat. All right, who would like to share first? Anyone? Mariah, please. I met Joe online. I really thought he loved me. He talked me into coming to meet him in Arizona. And at first, everything was perfect. He gave me presents, made me feel special. Then he would tell me that if I didn't do what he asked me to do with those other men, that I didn't love him. So, I did whatever he asked even though it made me sick to my stomach. I ran away once and I hid, and he tracked me down and he beat me up. But at that time, I had nowhere to go. He was all I had. After, you took me in. I had no family, but then you found me, and you helped me to get my faith back. How'd you get out? I was with the same gang too. It hurts now but it gets better. My friend Zoe and I tried to get out together but they caught her. I wanna help her but... Hey, the fear's always gonna live in here. They're still out there doing what they do. You gotta deal with it the way you deal with it, but I'm gonna talk. You'll find your strength. Okay? No, no! You're not that smart Diva. Help me. Help! Rachel, help! Rachel, help me. No! Latisha! No! No, oh my God. Hello, Mario. Hi. Too much sugar! It's bad for you, Nala's working out well. Diva's being dealt with today. I know. Should we need to be worried about Angel? Why are you asking me? This entire shit-storm is your fault. I like your mother. We had some good times, she and I. Seems to me you have a decision to make. You need to bring Angel home, or your mom and I are no longer friends. Luckily the driver was apprehended before anyone was injured. And earlier today, the charred remains of 16 year-old Latisha Jones, a former sex trafficking victim who was rescued from her captors six months ago, were discovered in North East of LA. No suspects have been yet identified. They killed her. It's my fault. It's all my fault. No, it's not. Honey, what's wrong? It's all my fault. Angie? Rachel's here. Sweetheart, I think it might really help you to talk to her. Leave me alone. I'm coming in. Can I join you? How are you doing? I have to show this to my parents too, don't I? I've seen this before. They're trying to lure you back by threatening your family. They know where I live. Chase and his team will protect you. Like they did Latisha? We can't change what happened her. Latisha was trying to stand up for herself and the other girls. When I got out, they killed four girls before I even got the courage to speak up. I carry that with me every day. Come here. It's gonna be okay. Everything is gonna be okay. I'm gonna be with you through everything. We can't change what they did to us. They stole our childhood, and we're not gonna let them take one more second of your life. What life? I can't sleep, I'm too afraid to go outside, and everyone looks at me like I'm broken and fragile. You gonna now want to find have to find a way to forgive yourself, to set yourself free. Whatever they did to your body does not change the essence of who you are. Look here. I struggled for a very long time. A very long time. And eventually I realized... I realized that leaning into my faith and using my experience to help other girls was everything. I wanna help, just that... It's okay. I understand. I do. You're not alone, Angie. We have to talk to the police. We'd like to take you all to a safe house, immediately. Don't worry, Maddie is gonna be fine with Warren. She's really good with kids. Thank you. I wanna help. No, Angie. It's dangerous. You know what happened to that other girl. Agreed. We've been through enough already. If I don't testify, I will end up like Latisha. And who knows what will happen to Maddie, and to you guys? As long as they're out there we will never be safe! They have other girls my age too. They named me Angel. I used to get raped sometimes 20 or 30 times everyday. Sometimes they would beat me or burn me, just because it would turn them on. They did unspeakable things. I wanna get them. Thank you. I failed you. Dad. Forgive me. It's not your fault. - Hey. - Hey. Okay, are you ready Angie? Okay. Let's start with where they were holding you. That motel, it's about 30 mins from where we were. I think we were in an industrial area. And we were seeing warehouses, big buildings. Is this the place? The guy that works for Ida, Deacon. Are you sure it's gonna be all right? I mean are you sure about everybody here and at the shelter? They texted me, so, they must have gotten my number. We are going to keep you safe, We've got you a new phone. Okay? Okay, look at this. You see that? That's a tracker. Keep it on you at all times. And the phone will tell us where you are too. Angie, the only people with this number are your parents, Rachel and myself. Thanks. We'll keep you here. The downstairs is that way, and your bedrooms right this way. I'll take these. So, for how long are we gonna have to hide here? I don't know. I'm sorry, Maddie. For everything. I'm sorry about the other day. I'm really scared, Ange. It's gonna be okay. I am too. Thanks for the coffee, I needed it. Still got a lot of work to do. I just needed a pen. You said that I should start doing a journal and I wanna write my feelings down. Okay, I'm glad you wanna do that, Nala, but you shouldn't be in here. If you need supplies, just ask me next time, okay? Yeah. Hey, are you guys okay? I love you guys. - We love you- - I know. I'm one of the lucky ones. Oh, leave it open. Okay. Good night. Chase! It's Angie! She's left the house. What? How far has she gone? She's not answering. Hello? Hello? Rachel, they got to Angie. No. How did they contact her? Did anyone else have her number? No, we were the only ones. Are you sure? Rachel? Oh my God. - What? - Let me call you back. Wait a minute- - Nala! You gave them her number, didn't you? They have my baby. I had no other choice. Nala, they have Angie. You know where they are, you have to help me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. They're gonna kill me. You know that, don't you? I have no choice. I need your phone. Shoes off. Please, it's all we have. We can go away. Please. Get in. Get in the car. I got it. Thanks, Dan. They've got her. Let's go. I know where she is. She is at the warehouse building, on Alemedia Okay. Alemedia and sixth. Got it. What did you tell the police, Angel? What did you tell them? Take your time. It's important. I told them your names: Ida, Deacon, if that's what they even are. What else did you tell them? That's it. I promise. I didn't tell them anything they didn't already know. I wish I could believe you. Let's play our favorite game. No, no, no, no! Look, she's already told you everything, okay? She did, she's not stupid. I promise you, I promise. Nothing else, please. Let's try that again. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a rabbit by his toe. Goodbye. Get the girls, get my car ready. I'll call Ivan, get us a plane. He'll be happy to know we're delivering on Angel. Keep with her. What did you do? Get up! No! Get up, let's go! Come on. Don't leave anything behind. I'll call Ivan. - Get out. - Get her in the van with the girls. Get out! Go! Go! Move! Move! Freeze! The building is surrounded. Drop it! I will kill her. If she dies, you die. Angie, no! No, Angie, I've got her. Drop the gun. It's okay, Angie. Angie? Angie, don't do this. She's worth more to us alive. Cuff her Liam. The others, please. - Don't worry, - You have to get them. I'll find them. Show me your hands. Out of the car. Don't move. Zoe. Oh my God. Oh God. Angie. Where's my baby? I'm sorry, Nala. You said. You promised me! I know. They have a lead on that. They think they sold her, but we're gonna get her back, okay? - No! - I promise- - You promised me already! I'm so sorry. Please, she's all I have! Angie? Angie. Thank God you're safe. Are you okay? What about them? They're still out there. Let's get you home, baby. Yeah. Subtitles by explosiveskull
