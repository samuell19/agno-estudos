In commemoration of the 60th year anniversary of Kadokawa Group Ground Self Defense Force East Fuji Station Begin experiment. Activate shields. Emergency. The plasma level has exceeding the upper limit. Let's not push it, Kanzaki. We can postpone it, right? No, let's proceed. Power output to the max. What's that? A blast! This is the experiment site reporting. There's been an emergency. Special Experiment Division's third company has disappeared! October 13, 2003, 15:34 All stand by. Do not leave your posts. All stand by, roger. All systems down except the radio. Headquarters isn't responding. Continue communication. Roger. Kurebayashi, get the working as soon as possible. Roger. Where on earth? What's going on here? Sgt. Morita! Sgt. Morita! Enemy attacking. - What? Advance, forward! Colonel, permission to fire. No firing permitted. All stand by. TIME SLIP 1549 Sengoku Jieitai Mt. Fuji Observatory reports that the hat like cloud continues... to hover at the top of the mountain since the summer... keeping the apex invisible for the record length of 90 days straight. Good night. Goodbye. - Later. Sir, you can't hope to work in the main office again with this score. They might even send you to the warehouse. October 6, 2005, 1:35 I might actually like that better than this. We've got to cut down on the costs. Let's fire the part timers. Please tell them. Me? Who else? You're the manager. That's not my cup of tea. Well, I'm going home now. Goodbye. See you. Sorry, we're closed. We're from the Ministry of Health. Manager. Are you in charge of the premise? Yes. I'm Kashima, the manager here. We were notified of a case of food poisoning. The person says he had eaten here earlier. It's all right. Don't worry. Bye. Goodbye. This is a late night visit. Yusuke Kashima, former First Lieutenant, I believe? I'm Major Mori, Ground Self Defense Force Eastern Army. I'm Mie Kanzaki, Army Research Headquarters. I sure am a civil servant. So? Do you remember Col. Matoba? He died in an accident during exercise. That was 2 years ago. Officially, that is. What do you mean? Do you know what Solar Maximum is? What on earth is that? The sun's activity becomes prominent in 11-year cycles. The plasma emitted at that time affects our electronic devices. The phenomenon is called Solar Maximum. It can be fatal if it happens during a military exercise. That's why we decided to develop a system that prevents such interference... by creating a magnetic shield and redirecting the plasma. Special Experiment Division's third company led by Col. Matoba... was participating in the experiment. Hey, what the heck is this? As you saw it. But Col. Matoba and his company aren't dead. They're alive. What do you mean? They were blown away. Blown away? We found the vegetation and soil to be from 500 years ago. 500 years ago? Then, three days later... It's back to normal, I see. Please have a close look. Further investigation revealed he was a man from the past. From the past? From the year 1547... The height of a Warring States era. The area the third company was on was switch with the same area from the past. That's why we know they're alive. We suspect they're in the era this samurai comes from. Operation Romeo? We'll rescue the third company. That's dandy but how on earth can we get there? We'll time slip like they did. Time Slip? A satellite detected an abnormal activity level on the sun three days ago. We expect the same level of plasma emission as when the accident happened. With that, theoretically, we should be able to travel to the same time period they did. We want you to participate in the experiment as an observer. On such a short notice? You didn't even ask if it's convenient for me. We had submitted your name a while ago. But the executives were careful about getting an outsider involved. We just got permission after a long wait. Why do you want me now? You're the only official who's ever been able to control... the situation in the simulation exercise D-3 that Col. Matoba created. We need your help in order to locate Col. Matoba's company swiftly. I'm not as capable as you think I am. You were a member of the F Unit that Col. Matoba created, second in rank after him. The F Unit was a special squad that would even engage... in a preemptive strike if it's called for. You left Self Defense Force when the Unit was dissolved. Col. Matoba's company disappeared in this place 2 years ago. We've waited so long for the opportunity to rescue to arrive. We can't afford to let it pass. Say you succeed in rescuing them, how are you planning to return? The field that got switched around returned to normal... in exactly 74 hours and 27 minutes after the incident. We should be able to return to the present... if we get back to the same field within the time period. It's all a hypothesis. When it happened... I had the power to stop the experiment if I wanted. Had I only stopped it... it would've never happened. It's my fault Col. Matoba was time slipped. So, I've got to go get him. I beg you. I need to get home before noon. What? I need to open the restaurant. Look. What's that? Some call it an Imaginary Number Space. We simply call it the Hole. The Hole? A hole that devours anything of this world, be it light or matter. It was a size of a golf ball when it was first discovered. It keeps on growing, so, we built a military base here... in order to hide it from the world. This isn't the only place. There are Holes appearing in various locations in Japan. Like a worm eating away at it. It all started when Col. Matoba's company disappeared. The past is attacking us. The past is attacking? History's being distorted by Col. Matoba's company's existence in the past. It's forcing our world out of existence. Just as if you killed your parent before you were born, you can't exist today. I believe history is able to integrate a minor infliction and repair itself. Otherwise, we would have disappeared instantly as soon as... Col. Matoba and his men arrived in the past. But now suddenly it's threatening to eliminate us. We suspect Col. Matoba and his men are meddling with history in a major way. If we let it, Japan... ...as well as the world itself will be swallowed in the Holes... and disappear. The only way for us to survive it is to get them back here. Which one is it? Are you going 'cause you want to save Matoba... or 'cause the world will disappear if you don't? Which one is it? You don't make any sense. I came here 'cause you said you wanted to save Mr. Matoba. And now you're saying the past is attacking us and what not. Don't change your stories. We're facing the possible end of the world. It's no time to make a fuss over it! Sure, it is. I wish the world would disappear. It's time. Take me home. Let's go. Let's go. Here we go! Here we go! We've got 2 km to go! Proceed! Proceed! Salute. Attention. F Unit is dissolved as of today. We'll join Special Experiment Division's third company. Why are we dissolved? It's the executives' decision. They feel the time isn't ripe. I'm sorry. So are we going to accept it? Col. Matoba? Kashima! Are you guys going to accept this? - Shut up! Are you now? Chicken kabobs. You... Are you bored as a samurai who abandoned his sword? What do you want? It's my honor. I am a follower of Saito Yamashiro-no-kami Dosan of the Mino Province... My name is Iinuma Shichibei Toshichika. Talk like a normal person. I'm not a samurai. In today's world, there's no such thing as a samurai. I heard that you had remarked you wished the world would disappear. Then, why are you living your life? A man will have something to protect as long as he lives. I wouldn't hesitate to kill a man if it serves my lord. That's what the Warring States era is like. But look at this peaceful world. You can choose to live any life you want, not bound by social status, if you're willing. Now that the world is about to disappear, don't you have anything to protect? Is it merely your own life that matters? I say, such a coward should disappear from this world. I resign as of today. Is that right? I'll miss you. What made you decide to join the Force? The only reason I can think of is so that I can live on my own. To live, I see. Letting time go by and letting others decide things for you... that's what the Japanese have become today. To live is to have a resolution. Don't let temporary moods sway you. Follow what you believe in. Be responsible for the future. The end of F Unit isn't the end of the world. It's a new beginning. Don't forget it, Kashima. The purpose of Operation Romeo is to rescue and to restore. That is, to rescue the third company and to restore the course of history. We can travel as far as 456 years back in time. Which means, presumably, we'll be arriving in the year 1549... 2 years after the third company arrived. Unnecessary contact with the locals is prohibited. We'll be using shock bullets. The head and cartridge are made of cellulose and are biodegradable. This way we can avoid leaving our traces to a minimum. That's all for the review. Lastly, I'd like to introduce to you former First Lt. Yusuke Kashima... who will be joining us as an observer. I'm Kashima. Mr. Mori, I have a question. What is it? What about real ammo? We'll carry some, but for emergency use only. For emergency use only, I see. Do you have a problem? No. You're an observer. Watch what you say. All systems go. Machine #1, operating normally. October 13, 2005, 12:05 All board your assigned vehicles. Mr. Kashima. We meet again. Yeah. Maintenance Unit cleared. Romeo Troop, ready. Launch Operation Romeo. Start magnetic shield. Shield is on. The plasma level is exceeding the upper limit. A fog-like vortex has appeared. Prepare for impact. This is the Captain. Report status. What's the status? All systems are down except the radio... in all vehicles including the chopper. Synchronize time at 14:00. It's 13:59 now. 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... now. It's 14:00. We have 74 hours and 26 minutes to go. The first day. 14:00. 74 hrs. 26 min. remaining Check equipment then Units 1 and 2, survey the surroundings. Unit 3 will check arms. Unit 4 will begin installation of the landmark. The landmark installation complete. All right, let's go. We've come to a horrible time. Let's install the sensor quickly and return to the base. Roger. Sgt. Mikuni, look. You aren't supposed to contact any locals. He's fine. He should regain consciousness in no time. Who authorized this? Any contact with the locals is prohibited. It was my... - He was about to die. Mr. Kashima, we're not in our time period. Well, would you have let him die? You were once an officer yourself. Please obey your orders. Thanks. You covered for me. No... Please. No, I quit. My daughter won't come near me. Says I stink. Why are you carrying a lighter, then? My son gave it to me on Fathers Day. I find a male child easier to approach. Security Alarm System operating normally. Why did you send out the chopper? To survey the surrounding environment. The radar is working normally again. It's too dangerous to fly it in the daylight. We're following a tight schedule. It's my job to make decisions. Report the present location of Omega 1. Omega 1's present location, 320. This is Omega 1. We're maintaining the altitude of 1500. Observe the environment and report back to me. Roger. An object is spotted at 1 o'clock, distance 2500. Mt. Anmo. It's not that far from here. What's on Mt. Anmo? It's Anmo Castle. You should be lying down. Anmo Castle? It's not in the map. Aren't you with the enemy? Have you seen men in this kind of outfit? Don't be hasty. They aren't our enemy. They joined Oda's army and attacked Suruga. They killed my family. Oda? Do you mean Oda Nobunaga? That's right. Lt. Yamase, can you approach the object? This is Omega 1. We'll approach the object. What on earth is that? It's a guided missile, approaching rapidly. A guided missile? Omega 1, return to base at once. Roger. We avoided the missile. On our way. What was that for? Another missile approaching! They disappeared from the radar. Omega 1, come in. Come in! Stop, or I'll shoot! We lost communication with Section 3. There are intruders in Section 1 & 2. Section 4 is penetrated. Section 5 is surrounded. What is going on? There are a large number of intruders. Taniguchi here. Security is under attack. Aaghh! Mr. Mori, have all men to return to vehicles. Everyone, board your vehicles! Evacuate headquarters! Yes, sir! Hurry, everyone, back in your vehicles! Board your vehicles! Board your vehicles! We'll retreat to Mt. Takazashi. Roger. Don't. Mt. Takazashi is the enemy's fort. What? Are you familiar with the area? It's my playground. Mj. Mori. Understood. All vehicles, follow my lead. Kid, guide us. I'm not a kid, I'm Tosuke. Hurry, don't panic! Everyone board your vehicles! All vehicles, drive quickly and avoid the enemy. We're completely surrounded. Break though them. - But... It's oil. Get out. - Yes. How's the battle going? They report our allies have brought down many of the enemy soldiers. How's my army doing? A few men got shot but there was no casualties. They were shot and didn't die? What's that? They're nothing to be afraid of. Princess, stop it! Try it, Kagamino. You can gain a different perspective of the world. What would you do if your husband catches you like this? Nothing. He doesn't even see me. I wish I could go outside. I want to go deer watching once in a while. Princess. You're too much like your father. The first day. 20:00. 68 hrs. 26 min. remaining There are 18 remaining, including the wounded. We lost the observation unit, 1 small tank, 2 trucks, and the UH1. The sensors have been installed. Thanks. We couldn't even have a funeral for them. Mr. Mori, let's use real ammo. We're ordered not to kill the locals by headquarters. Do you know how many men you've lost? We're allowed to use real ammo... only to eradicate Special Experiment Division's third company. Eradicate? I see I'm the only one who wasn't informed. So, that's what you meant by emergency. That was your intention all along. It was merely a hypothetical scenario... that the third company was changing the course of history. But, it still doesn't make it acceptable for us to harm the locals. Going at this rate, we'll be the one to be eradicated. We should consider taking initiative in... Do you want to kill people so much? In any case, I'm the commander here. Please obey my orders. How old are you? I'm 13. So is my son. Is your son in a battle trying to make it in the world too? Battle? He plays soccer all day long. Soccer? Why don't you take a little break? I haven't finished checking the analyzer. You haven't eaten, have you? You should make yourself eat, or you won't last. I'm fine. A real life battle is nothing like a simulation exercise. Tell me... you joined because you wanted to take responsibility for what you've done. Is that really true? As I told you before. Is that all there is? Thanks. It's dangerous to stay with them. Go back home in the morning. I won't. I smell the world. They say the world smells in such a way when it's about to change. That's what my father said. The smell of the world changing, I see. He wasn't my real father. He saved me. Your father had interesting things to say. Then, do you know what Oda of Owari is doing in Suruga? Because the Tendo people sided with him. Is the word Tendo what commoners use? That's right. "Those who guide the heavens." That's what we call them. Even Saito of Mino has given in to side with them. M'lord? I also heard he gave his daughter to Oda. The second day. 6:48. 57 hrs. 38 min. remaining Enemy approaching! Enemy approaching! How did they get here undetected by the sensors? Sir, the sensors' circuit has been disconnected. What are we going to do, Mr. Mori. We're the Tendo people of Oda's army. Oda's army... Yoda. 1st Lt. Kashima. Drop your weapons! We won't kill you! Yoda... Why did you attack us? 1st Lt. Yoda... We came here to rescue you. Why did you, Yoda? Answer me. Do what they tell you. Shichibei. Shichibei, what shall we do with the brat? You're free to go. You're a low life! It's m'lord's order. Sorry. The second day. 12:17. 52 hrs. 9 min. remaining So, this is what a castle looks like. It isn't from this time period. What are those? I suspect they're oil refineries. They're equipped to supply their own fuel. It has been long since. I, Iinuma Shichibei, report back to you now. Is it true you've been to the land of the Tendo people, Shichibei? Yes. So... Who are the Tendo people that just arrived? They're friends of the Tendo people with Oda's army. They say they came here to bring their people back to their land. I believe there's a fellow named Matoba who serves Oda. Matoba? There's no such person. He's the leader of the Tendo people. You mean, Nobunaga himself. I was waiting for you, Kashima. I knew it'd be you if anybody would come. Why are you doing this, Mr. Matoba? Col. Matoba, we're here to rescue you. Why are you doing this to us? 2 years ago... We were suddenly transported into the middle of a battlefield. No firing allowed. All retreat. Colonel! My men went down quickly. I thought of destroying all our equipment and killing ourselves. But what good would that do if we died? Were we transported here to die? No. I will no longer be a Self Defense official. Colonel! History, time itself is challenging us to fight. I'm going to fight. We're in an era where the winner conquers. We're going to survive here. M'lord! It was Oda Nobunaga that I killed. Oda had truce with the Tendo people by letting them join his army. Since then, nothing could stop Oda. I wasn't taking him seriously at first... but when I had a battle with him, it became clear to me... that I was no match for him. That's why I let him marry Noh. The daughter of Saito Dosan is my wife, just as history intended it. They made me Oda Nobunaga. History has an incredible power to restore itself. History even integrates alien elements like us, trying to get itself back on course. But what awaits us in the future? Tokugawa isolated the nation in order to keep his original intention alive. Overconfidence in our own power got us into World War II. Then, we lost in a devastating way. I decided to start things over in this era... so that we can build a strong nation where we're proud of being Japanese. The folks of my era don't even know how to protect themselves. I have no intention of going along with it. Kurebayashi, show them. Yes. 1st Lt. Kurebayashi. Get up. 1st Lt. Kanzaki, what's that? It's a new type of battery... for the observation satellite we used during the experiment, called MHD. If we remove the central mechanism and let it generate maximum power... it turns into a bomb as powerful as a nuclear weapon. Its safety lock has been removed. We'll drop it into the crater to cause eruption and destroy Mt. Fuji. It'll be dozens of times more powerful than the eruption in the Ho'ei Era... and will destroy the Kanto Region almost completely. There I want to start a new nation from scratch. Why don't you join me, Kashima? If you change the course of history that way... the 6 billion people who live in the other era will disappear. We'll have a whole new population of 6 billion and a whole new history. Is this what you mean by taking responsibility for the future? That's right. Who will protect the 6 billion who live back there? Mr. Matoba, tell me. It's nothing more than a massacre. You haven't changed, have you? 1st Lt. Kanzaki... You're responsible for transporting me to this world. You settle this matter. What's the matter? This will end it all. Why didn't you shoot him? Could you have done that yourself? Kashima... Stay here with us. Your decision will determine whether the rest of them can return home alive. Hey, Yoda... Is this the kind of future we dreamed of when we were in Matoba's company? They took good care of me in their land of Heisei. I have obligations. Would you please reconsider their execution? It's not up to me. I plead. That's enough, Shichibei! Hurry up! The sun will set soon! Yes, sir! I can never get used to this odor. It's inconvenient, but the iron wheels don't run without this oil. A horse only eats hay. That's right. - Right. You're back, Tatsuie. How can you stand this, Nobumori? I understand this is all for creating a special squad. But why should you let your men kill each other? It creeps me out. M'lord's logic isn't all that crazy. A soldier should have a single-minded focus on killing the enemy. The nation will become stronger and stronger. Eventually, as m'lord predicts... We'll have our power known in far lands beyond the ocean. Shichibei. You returned at last. Shichibei. Yes. You don't look well. Are you thinking about the people of Heisei you came back with? You must be concerned for the safety of my father and me. Then, can you dismiss the time you spent with them as an illusion? I have no choice. Look up at the sky full of stars at night... and one will see many animals running free. That's what you told me. For the animals running across the sky, events that occur down here are all trivial. I never forgot your spirit revealed through those words of yours. I am a star... looking down at you. Do not worry, Shichibei. I am the daughter of the man called the Asp. Live the life that you want. Come down. You're the wife, I believe? What if I am? I want to save the Tendo people who recently arrived, for I owe them. By yourself? I can handle it fine. Nobunaga is just a fool without the tricks the Tendo people taught him. You're a mouthy little monkey. Shichibei. Yes. You are not allowed beyond this point. Refrain yourselves. The Princess permits us to share the food the newly arrived Tendo people brought. Yes. The third day. 8:00. 32 hrs. & 26 min. remaining Kashima, let me hear your answer. The nation you want to create... can go to hell. This is the Warring States era. Only those who express power can survive. Katsue. - Yes. If you win, I'll let all of you return to the Heisei era. Shichibei... Prove your loyalty to Sir Oda and me. Yes, sir! Mr. Kashima, forgive me. Pile them up nicely. Bring that over there. Begin! Hey, stop. Don't interfere. Follow what you believe in, Shichibei. Have you lost courage, Shichibei? M'lord, please wake up. What did you say? I, Shichibei, learned a new meaning of the word "the future" in the world of Heisei. The people of Heisei live dreaming of the future to come. It was a peaceful world that we are striving for. However, the man sitting right there... wants to distort the course of history... and create a world of destruction built upon massacre after massacre. M'lord... The future is the hope of the human race. I plead you, please, reconsider your position. Sir Saito... This man risks his own life in an attempt to wake you up. How would you respond? Doku, bring a bow. Yes. Father. Hey. Who is that? Get in the vehicle! We'll retreat! Get a gun. Quick! Mikuni, get the other vehicles back! Hurry! Roger! Mr. Mori, direct us. We'll use real ammo. We're going to survive. Yes, sir! Get them! Colonel. That idiot. O'Noh. Takanashi, guard the back. Aim. What a fool Matoba is. We're Self Defense Force officers. We'll distract them. Go. We must complete this mission. Go! Mj. Mori. I'm the commander of the Romeo Troop. Major Akihiko Mori of Self Defense Force Army. I'm here to terminate Oda Nobunaga! Let's get it on! Mj. Mori! Hey, we should go. But... Obey his orders. We've been ordered... to avoid killing or injuring the locals. Damn, I'm out of ammo. The same here. Damn it! Hurry! Let's go. Aim! Fire! Kanzaki. Kanzaki! I'll get you out of there! Colonel. Send Dosan's army out. Gather all my men and vehicles at this castle. We've got one more day before the time switches back again. There's no one else who's higher in rank above me. I'm now the commander of the Romeo Troop. Our war power is less than half of what we originally had. We cannot carry out our mission with this number of men. We should go back home to regroup. But then, our world will probably disappear before we can. We're left with three options. To keep a low profile and survive in this time... To return home and spend the remaining hours with our families... or... To attack Anmo Castle again. I'm going. Mie Kanzaki is waiting. Even if there's only a 1% chance, I wish to follow through with the mission. Anybody wants to come with us? All right. Everyone go back to your position and check equipment. Wait for my orders. Let's go. Yes, sir! They're like you. They have something to protect. Something to protect? Not for me. I'm going back to settle accounts with 1st Lt. Matoba. Well, it doesn't matter. I like who you are now... better than who you were when we first met. But you're right, we have no chance to win with the power we have. What can we do? What are you worried about? All you have to do is to follow that advice. Be quiet. Did your father train you to move quickly like that too? Who on earth is your father? My father is Hachisuka Koroku Masakatsu. Hachisuka? Hey, is your father Hachisuka Koroku? That's what I said. I see. We've got history's ace card. I see. We just have to change the rules. The last day. 2:34. 13 hrs. 52 min. remaining Did you return to be executed? I'm ready to give up my own life. Let me express my thoughts to m'lord one more time. I swear on the words that I received from Princess Noh. I am telling the truth. The last day. 6:28. 9 hrs. 58 min. remaining Hey, are you doing all right? What'd you do that for? Grandma, how're you feeling today? Oh, thank you. What's that? On guard, men. Did I surprise you, father? Tosuke? You're alive! What's that? And what are you wearing? I have a favor to ask of you. What? Is it something fun? I knew you'd understand. And my name's no longer Tosuke. It's Kinoshita Tokichiro. That's my name. I thank you. Matoba... You gave me a chance... to live a life as something better than an expendable pawn. You aren't a expendable pawn. That's why I came. No... Everything's changed. Kurebayashi, prepare for evacuation. Shiroki Troop will evacuate to the center in East of Takada. It's truly a sight. It's fine. This is the head of Iinuma Shichibei. He was stupid enough to return to me, so I had him executed on the spot. What about Kashima? Don't be hasty. I have an interesting piece of information. Kashima is planning to going to Kyoto. Going to Kyoto? With the Heisei machinery... He plans to scare the Emperor into issuing a Direct Order... claiming you're the royal enemy to be eradicated. He will then get warriors from around the nation on his side and attack this castle. Imagawa wouldn't stay quiet about it either. You mean, Imagawa Yoshimoto will...? That's right. Kashima told him you're destined to kill him in the Battle of Okehazama. Yoshimoto panicked hearing the story. He requested his wife's brother, Shingen of Kai, to back him up... and is now preparing to attack your castle. I don't care about this castle. It's the D3, Yoda. Yes. Do you know how Kashima conquered the situation in the D3? No. He rewrote the program before it had started. You mean, he cheated? That's the correct answer. Rules are there to be broken. Send the chopper Cobra to Kyoto immediately. Eliminate Kashima and others along with the Emperor. Send the main force too. Yes. I'd better think about which way I should go. The last day. 14:25. 2 hrs. 1 min. remaining Mr. Kashima... Wear this. Good luck. - Thanks. Shall we? Proceed. This single device can kill hundreds of thousands of people. It has enough power to contaminate the earth and flatten Mt. Fuji. Man can indeed do frightening things. Is there no end to killing each another? The last day. 14:57. 1 hr. 29 min. remaining] It's time to begin the operation. Forgive us. The oil refinery's been attacked. The main army is also under attack. What? Break it down. Intruders! Intruders! Sir Mikuni, move on. Sir Mikuni. Mr. Mikuni! Let's carry him over there. I'm fine. We'll hold the fort here to the death. We won't let anyone inside. Please go on, Mr. Kashima. You should finish Col. Matoba with your own hand. Mr. Mikuni, take this. A large number of intruders have penetrated the castle. You cannot even make your loved one happy. And you are talking about changing the course of history? It's laughable. You're betraying me. Put down your weapon! Main control to all units. Return immediately. The enemy is at Anmo Castle. Don't move. Stop it. History's trying to get back on its original course. You have no right to change history. Those who live in the time alone can make history. The child we saved turned out to be Toyotomi Hideyoshi. And you aren't Oda Nobunaga. What? He was with us all along. Princess Noh! Where is Princess Noh? It's history restoring itself. By trying to change it for your selfish purpose, you've been excluded from it. Advance! You told me to take responsibility for the future. That's why I'm here. I'll protect from you the era that my friends and I were born... and the future. Then, try and protect it. Stop it! Don't... Run! Fire! Quiet down! Quiet down! Here's the Emperor's Decree to terminate Oda! The battle is over! What? By the Emperor's order... I am here to take out the royal enemy Oda Nobunaga. You look manly, father. Sir Mikuni. Sir Mikuni. Mr. Kashima is in the tower. Go there. Got it. Live well and conquer the world. I should've stayed alive... to see my son again. Sir Mikuni. Where's O'Noh? M'lord. This saved me again. What's the matter? Is this it? Kashima, take a good look... at the dawn of a new era. They'll explode 20 min. from now, and the world will change. Col. Matoba! Mr. Matoba! Protect it... Kashima. Protect the world you believe in. There's still a way to save it. Col. Matoba. Cobra is back. Retreat! We might make it in time for the time slip. We've still got 18 min. I can't. The timer's locked. What are you doing? We'll take it back with us. When we arrived in this era, all electronic devices failed. This one may stop too. The wire nearest to you should be the main power cable. Take that off first. Got it. Princess. Go now! Yoda, Yoda, come home with us. Yoda! I can't go home alone. I... I had a full life in this era. Kashima, you go on living! Yoda... - Yoda! Sir Kashima! Hurry up now! All right, let's go. The castle is burning down. O'Noh... She's alive! Will you be all right with that? Whatever happens will happen. Tell Shichibei, that the future is in his hands. Roger. I see the vortex. We're diving in. It's stopped. We only went there to make history's ends meet, didn't we? We forced the roles of... Hideyoshi and Nobunaga on Tosuke and Shichibei. No one knows the truth of history. Their names may have changed... but I'm sure they'll continue to live their own lives. But... Live on. It's not the end... but the beginning. That's what Col. Matoba said. I hope the Heisei Era will be all right. There's no need for you to worry. The future is the hope of man's world. We can make it anything we want if we set our mind to it. Perhaps it lies in our hands. I see. So we're the one's to make it. There's the base. I see them. We're back. The future... is the hope of man's world, he said. October 16, 2005. 16:31 Let us take the MHD. Mr. Kashima.
