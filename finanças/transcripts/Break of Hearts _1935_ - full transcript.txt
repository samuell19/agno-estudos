McCull's Agency. No, sir. Nothing but the Roberti Concert. You'll go for that? Yes, I think I can get you three choice seats. Thank you. Please take these to the dining room. Wasn't that Franz Roberti? - Yes. I must say you might have been more amiable to my friends. My dear. Such dull friends. Besides, my mind was on something else. I saw her. The blond at the table. What, me? No, dear. Don't be absurd. How do you do, Mr Roberti. - How do you do. You know I'd never look at another woman. So I see. Madame will go home. Aren't you coming? - You know, I've got to see Thalma. That tiresome old Thalma. You are always going down to see him. You mean I am always promising to go. But you are dining with me? - My rehearsal. Oh. Then, after? 37 Washington Square, south. On Monday after school, I see you. Oh, Professor .. - And alone. Yes. Yes, come. Professor Thalma, you see, just at present my husband .. That is alright. You send him to me on Monday. We will talk about money later. Thank you. Thank you, Professor. Goodbye Professor. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Are you busy? Come in. What is it? Look. I have something I want you to hear. Yes, I heard you a moment ago, but I thought .. Yes, I was supposed to give a lesson and then she didn't come. I haven't any patience for such people. That is alright. She'll come tomorrow. I hope. But I have been busy all day. Have you a minute to listen? Of course. Always for you my little friend. I think it is pretty good. [ Door knocks ] Excuse me a minute. How are you, Maestro. - Well, I am glad to see you. Oh, you have someone with you. - No, no. Come in. She's a little friend from downstairs. Miss Dane, I have to present to you the most .. what shall I say ..? Rascal, blackguard, scoundrel .. - In other words: Franz .. Roberti. We have met someplace? - No. But I've heard you so often at concerts. - You were there on Wednesday? No. I haven't heard you this season but last year when I had more money. I see. - Franz. Miss Dane just came in to play one of her own compositions. You'd like to hear it wouldn't you? - Oh no. Oh, yes, yes. - But some other time. As I just came in to talk to you about my rearrangement of the Tristan music. Did you? Yes. I had to ask you if you thought the garden music would follow the prelude. Who do you think you are, trying to rearrange Wagner? Oh wait. Please, don't go. I'll come back. I am looking forward to hearing it. That wasn't kind of you, Franz. It wouldn't have hurt you to listen. And it would have meant so much to her. She is just beginning the climb and you should remember if anyone should .. The steps are not covered with carpet. Franz, I have felt many times there is something I should tell you. But I couldn't bring myself to hurt you. Now it must come out. Success is changing you. If you don't take care it will ruin your conducting, as it has for many others. Oh no, Maestro. Just because I don't want to .. I came down here to talk to you. About my Tristan arrangement. And instead, you expect me to spend my time listening to .. Look. What time is it now? Where is your watch? Don't tell me you have again .. It's being fixed. Come now. Give me that pawn ticket. I give you my word. - Give me that ticket. Ingrate! So this is what you do with my gifts. Alright. I will get it for you this time. But remember. Next time. It stays in. Giving the bread out of your mouth to a lot of would-be musicians. Why didn't you come to me? - You have done so much for me. Alright. I will get it for you now. Remember. This is the last time you get it back. [ Piano music ] [ Piano music ] [ Piano music ] [ Door knocks ] Come in. I thought it was you playing. You see. I recognise your music. I hope you didn't think me rude a moment ago. Of course I didn't. - I was really very anxious to hear it. But you know, when you haven't much time, how it seems to be less. Then you forgive me? You will play for me some other time? You will have to excuse the way things look. I wasn't expecting anyone. But I like the way it looks. Where I live they keep everything so ridiculously clean. This place is ridiculously clean, only it is all messed up. That is what I like about it. I used to live in a place that was always messed up. Just a few doors east. You did? I had a piano like that. A rented piano, isn't it? - Yes. Mine was rented too. And it had the same .. Thing sticking out of it. Maybe it is the same piano? Yes, it is the same piano. Not bad. Very modern. You are writing about that, aren't you. What? Washington Square. 5th Avenue. The beautiful sadness of the twilight. How did you know? Because I tried to write about the same thing. I didn't know you were a composer. - I am not. I wanted to be. But I suppose I didn't have it in me. That is why I am interpreter of other people's music. But you? You are going to become a great composer, aren't you. I don't know. I think so. That is, sometimes. Other times I just sit here and look around and .. And feel like a fool. Tell me. Have you ever submitted anything? Yes. - To whom? To .. you. Me? Then what happened? You sent it back. What did I say? That it was charming and lovely. Only that it lacked importance. - Oh, I am sorry. No. You were right. It did lack importance. You can give me another chance. You will play it for me sometime. I would love to hear some of it now but I am frightfully busy. Well, someday soon. You will get in touch with me. We will make it any time you say. And if it so happens that we never meet again. Do forgive me. Lots of luck. Goodbye. He is here. He is just getting out of his car. Alright, boys. Places. He is here. Mustn't keep him waiting. Which car did he come in this time? - The blue one. We got plenty time. It always takes him half an hour to say goodnight to her. Goodbye, darling. Goodnight sweetheart? I will see you later then. Very, very clever. You are very good with your impersonations. It is unfortunate that you are unable to impersonate a musician. And be of some use to me. Alright, gentlemen. One bar before the parade. One 75-cent seat for the Roberti concert please. I am sorry but they are all gone. I'll take a dollar one. I am very sorry but the Roberti concert is completely sold out. Surely there must be a seat somewhere. You see, tomorrow is his last concert of the season. It's been sold out for a month. I can't believe you haven't got a single seat. I told you there were no more seats. - Yes, I know. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Stop. Stop, stop! Why don't you blow? I am blowing. - Then blow harder. I may be the hardest blowing bassoonist in the world. Then kindly do some of your blowing into your bassoon. And you Schubert. You know. There was also a Schubert who was a great musician. You are not by any chance the same Schubert? No. I thought not. Two bars before presto. All the correspondence-school players. Will kindly leave the stage. Also, those who play by ear. Gentlemen, we will stay here until it is right. Even if it takes until tomorrow morning. [ Chair creaking ] What is it? Who is there? Stop! Do you hear me? Well. This is charming. How do you happen to be here? Well, I .. I came to buy a ticket. As I was leaving I heard you and I .. I just couldn't help it and I .. I just sort of slipped in. I hope you don't mind. Not at all. I am delighted to see you again. Except .. it is not going very well, is it. No. Not very. No, not .. I agree with you. What is the matter with it? Come. Tell me. I don't know but you .. You all seem so far away and then you .. You try to get near it by playing faster and blowing harder and then .. When that doesn't work you make jokes. Don't you like jokes? Yes. Sometimes. But wait until you hear it tomorrow. I wish I could but .. I couldn't get a ticket. Your concert is entirely sold out. Of course. They always are. I guess I had better go. I am sorry I interrupted you. Wait. You haven't got any tickets? - No. So you came all the way up here on a cold night like this and then .. I didn't mind that part. - I will get you a seat. You could? - I think so. Where do you want to sit? Where are the dollar-and-a-half seats? Up there. Come with me. Listen, boys. I know you are tired. I am too. But out there is a girl who's walked all the way from downtown to buy a seat. There is a girl who is the whole meaning of music. Who still has the quality of caring for things. Why wait until tomorrow? For an audience who won't know what we've played anyway. Let's play it now. As it should be played. For someone who is really worthy of it. Come on. Gentlemen. You have proved that you can be musicians. I thank you. That will be all for this evening. Hi there, white-man. What kept you? - Johnny. Why didn't you come in? It was quieter out here. We must hurry and get over to the Ritz. I am so sorry Johnny but I have another engagement. So I see. Excuse me. Let me present you Miss .. I am so sorry. What is your name? - Constance Dane. Oh yes, of course. Miss Dane. This is Johnny Lawrence. Hello. - How do you do. You must get used to Johnny. He's always under foot. It will be a pleasure, Miss Dane. Use me any time you want to take a walk. Johnny has nothing to recommend him. Except that he is very rich and he knows all the best champagnes. Yes. We make a great team. Wine and women. You must excuse us. - Surely. Goodnight. See you tomorrow, Johnny. - Hey, Connie! Haven't you got a friend? - No. She has not. Hey. You wouldn't want to go out and get tight would you, Beethoven? My name is Schubert. I feel better. - Did you feel badly? You don't have to feel bad to be better. Alright Edward, I can manage alone. - Yes, sir. Now we are going to feel better still. Here is something to give you an appetite. Oh, that is never necessary. To tonight. Sit down. Sit down. Hmm. Smells good. Good? It is delicious. Wait .. you will see. It is my favorite dish. Pompano. This is the first time you have ever had supper .. In a man's apartment alone? I thought so. And it is the first time that you have ever entertained a lady alone, isn't it. I see what you mean. But how did you know? Well .. Ah, the picture. Yes. All of them. Tell me, was she really as beautiful as that? I don't know. I think she thought so. The only thing I remember is that she had a terrible temper. And that one? She was silly. And that one? Oh, Lisa. She was beautiful. And wise. That is something a woman should never be. Wise. Isn't it funny. Thinking back over all the people you have known. Well, I don't know. You see I haven't known very many. No? Not even in that place you come from? What did you say the name was? North Calvert, Wisconsin. - North Calvert, Wisconsin. Didn't you know any boys there? Oh, of course. I knew them all. Anyone special? Yes, there was Homer Davenport. His father owned the hardware store. Really? And what happened? Nothing. Really. - No? Why not? Well, because of my music. His family said if we were married I would have to give it up. Did they? Yes, you see his mother thought that I played nicely enough already. Imagine playing nicely. And his Papa? His Papa? His Papa thought music was a waste of time. Cigarette? - No thank you. And what did the boy think? Well Homer didn't have much time to think. You see .. He worked in the hardware store. - Good boy. Do you like it? - Hmm. Aren't you ever lonely here in New York? Hmm, you bet I am. I am too sometimes. You? Well .. but you know quite a few people, don't you. Ah. You mean those. They haven't really helped much. Though I have cared for some of them. Even loved a few. Loved a few? - Desperately. While it lasted. And it never lasted? Uhuh. Not very long. You see .. each time you think this love is forever. This love is going to last and then .. And then? - Then you turn to something new. Something fresh. Someone else's smile. Someone else's eyes. You know, after a while. The laughter of promises. The tears. Even the memories get all mixed up. What is the matter? Don't you know? Beautiful things don't last. You must learn to enjoy them for a moment. And afterwards. You must learn to smile. As I do. You are not smiling. Inside. What? You know. I am a little afraid of you. You see things. Other people don't see. Don't you? Don't tell me you are one of those wise women. I'll try not to be. We won't allow that. Will we. Well, you .. You promised to let me play for you. Do you remember? Well. What do you want me to play? - What do you want to play? Well. I will .. I will play the first thing I ever played in public. Oh. You too have played in public, huh? - Yes. I can picture you. Your feet hardly touching the pedals. And your curls .. - Oh no. No. Red hair and freckles. Yes. It was always understood in North Calvert by my best friends .. That it wouldn't be my beauty that would get me into trouble. Are you sure? Yes .. quite. Well, I am not. Don't you know .. That you are the most exciting creature. You see. I would like to see you again and again. And perhaps again. But not just for the moment. But to have something. Maybe in your heart. I will get your coat. Goodnight. Goodnight. Darling. - Listen. I told you the kind of man I am. Don't you see what I mean? I don't want to make you unhappy. - I couldn't be unhappy now. Are you sure? - Yes, I am sure. You see, I have loved you for such a long time. Since way this afternoon. As long as that? - Yes. As long as that. And so long before. Since I first knew of you. Tell me it is true, Franz. Tell me again it is all true. All of it. Yes. It is true. It is delicious. Wait. You will see. My favorite dish. Ham sandwich. And only as I can make it. You like it, huh? Magnificent? This is the first time that you've ever had supper in a lady's apartment alone. Isn't it? The very first. Liar. Why don't you make an honest man of me? Why don't you marry me? Can you imagine the headlines? "Unknown lady composer makes honest man of Franz Roberti." Can't you hear the laughter? Can you see the faces when they hear that Roberti is a husband at last. Constance. Yes, Franz. This must last. It has been such a marvellous month. This is different from anything else. You are part of me. Please, darling. Say that you will marry me. Franz. We will have the most wonderful honeymoon. Italy, Vienna, Paris. The end of the world. Where's that? Any place we can be alone together. We will always be alone together. In our hearts. [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] I am coming. Have patience. I am coming. What? Not dressed yet? For me? No, no. Come, come. I have things for you to do. But Franz, how did you ever ..? Why, it is only .. What is the time? - Never mind the time. I am going to get married. Married? - Yes. She'll be here in a minute. Here? What is she coming here for? - Because you have got to give her away. Me give her away? Why, I don't even know her. Who is she? - Your little friend downstairs. Constance? - Yes. Why Franz, what has happened to you? - Everything. And for the first time. Hurry. Hurry now. Hello. - What kept you? I stopped by Brevort to pick this up. You got the tickets? - 900-dollars' worth. And the ring? - Fresh out of the hock-shop. Franz. Are you ready? Hello Johnny. Say. If I knew you can look that pretty I'd have married you myself. I wish I'd known. - It isn't too late. Oh, yes it is. Isn't your impatience a little unseemly at a moment like this? Besides, it isn't legal to get married without champagne. This is for you. Watch out for hay fever. That is music. Professor, you are a critic. I was when I was young. Well, here comes your youth right back at you, Professor. Wait a minute. Here we are. Blessings on you my children. And all the fond good wishes to your little friend. To today. To the tomorrows. Just a minute. We've got to have a rehearsal. Come on now. What is that you are playing? Just something I started in Washington Square. Listen. Were you really as lonely as that? Until you came. Ah, but .. I didn't crash in like that. Oh yes, you did. And then. Am I a part of that? You are all of it. Excuse, Se?or. Telegram. Look. "Your first programs approved." "Rehearsal schedule starts October 2nd." "Victor Trowbridge." If we leave tomorrow we can catch the Roma from Genoa. Think of it, darling. Eight more days and we'll be in New York again. You are delighted to go back, aren't you. You don't understand. It's my work. - I know. We shall have great excitement. You want to go back to all that don't you, Franz? Don't be afraid, darling. We shall still be alone together. In our hearts. Attention d?butantes and such. After the sensational success of yesterday's highbrow concert .. Under the baton of the irresistible Franz "He's the Tops", Roberti. Most of you are probably making plans for a date. However, Mrs Roberti is in there pitching, so .. Still your beating hearts, my pretties. At least for the time being. From Hollywood .. What say we pick up Constance and all have dinner together? No, no Johnny. I will be rehearsing for hours. I leave for a few months and what becomes of the Roberti tone? It's gone. Afternoon, Mr Roberti. - Hello Max. Afternoon, Mr Lawrence. - How are you. What have you today? Well, I have .. - Oh .. Poppies. Yes, but I have orchids and I give you my word that they are the finest .. If he had poison ivy, it would still be the finest. Poppies. Fix me a big box. - As you wish, sir. They'll remind Constance of Italy. Say, you could save a lot of dough by sending her a hunk of garlic. Why, Franz Roberti. Sylvia. I am delighted. - You are? You've been home for weeks and haven't so much as called me. Hello Johnny. - Sylvia. How are you? - Fine, thanks. I suppose the only way anyone gets to see you now is to buy a ticket. It's always the woman that pays, Sylvia. Who do you think you are kidding? Come along, Franz. I'm going up to Didi's for cocktails. She will cry for joy when she sees you. I am sorry, but I am on my way home for dinner. Dinner? Why it is years before dinner. Come along now, Franz. Didi will never forgive you. And neither will I for that matter. Well, maybe for one. Well, that is more like it. Mr Roberti. Yes, Max? I do hope he doesn't let his marriage ruin him. It beats me why you think Franz could be bothered with any of our crowd. When he's married to a girl that's worth more than all of us put together. Come along Johnny. We will have one drink. And then we'll bring the flowers to Constance. I am sorry. I have got another date. Have you? - Yeah. I'll see you later. Don't forget now. That rehearsal isn't at Didi's. Come on, Sylvia. Hello Henderson. Very nice to see you again, Mr Lawrence. It has been some time. - Well, you haven't aged at all. Johnny. Welcome stranger. It has been weeks. Don't tell me I've got the wrong house and the right night. Weren't you expecting me to dinner? I'm sorry Johnny, but .. I've been the victim of a plot. I bumped into Franz today and he insisted that I come to dinner. And then forgot to tell me. As a matter of fact he called me an hour ago to say he wouldn't be home himself. Well, I guess I am just gypped out of a free meal. Nonsense. We will dine together. Where have you been keeping yourself? - All over town. We've missed you. Henderson, will you bring Mr Lawrence a cocktail please. Yes, madam. Johnny. I am worried about you. You and Franz used to be awfully good friends. But now you never come to see us. What is it? I haven't done anything to make things different, have I? You? Certainly not. It hasn't anything to do with you. What is it then? Why have you been staying away? Johnny. You haven't fallen in love? Ah, you have guessed my dirty little secret. You know Constance, every time I fall in love with a girl she celebrates .. By marrying somebody else. Johnny. I believe you are serious. Do you love her very much? Very much. Then go after her. If you really love her nothing else matters. You've have been reading books again. Besides, I don't think I'd know just how. Well Johnny, I will teach you. Now look here, I will be the girl you are trying to .. Anyway, you ask me to dinner and I'll say: "I did have an engagement". "But I will break it for you". I'll tell Henderson never mind dinner. - Well, I guess you got me hooked. Where to go? You could hardly expect to win a girl of my appetite anywhere except The Ritz. The Ritz? Now Constance, be reasonable. Some little inexpensive hideaway. No, no. The Ritz. I won't be two seconds. Hello? The Ritz? Let me have Rico at the bar. Same again. No water. Sorry we won't be here to dinner, Henderson. Yes, sir. Hello Rico? Is Mr Roberti there? Has he been there? Can you tell me whether he .. Let me have the dining room. Hello. Has Mr Roberti come in yet? Roberti. Franz Roberti. You don't know him? Who is this? Let me have Fran?ois. Then let me have someone who can .. Someone who can reserve a table. What's that? None left? Well, never mind. Got to go somewhere else. No, I said The Ritz. Constance, you're not becoming one of those unreasonable women are you? But there's no tables. Don't let a waiter stand in the way of winning me. Dining room please. The idea of taking "no" for an answer. Why, it's enough to make any woman lose confidence in you. Dining room? I want to reserve a table for Mr Lawrence. Mr John Lawrence. Yes, of course for two. In about half an hour. Thank you. See what a woman's sweet voice can do? I know what a woman's sweet voice can do. It gets very irritating. We can dig up Franz after his rehearsal and all go out to supper together. I was afraid your husband would eventually come between us. I am glad you insisted on The Ritz. - I insisted? Yes. It always terrifies me but I suppose I've got to get used to it. Johnny. Johnny, I have disgraced you. - Now what? The buckle has come off my slipper. - I wish I had brought my sewing kit. Oh, Johnny. Wait a minute. I'll have a maid sew it on for me. Where will you be? - Right around here. I don't know whom he was trying to keep dry with that umbrella. You don't mind if it rains? I like it. Of course. You're a musician. The wilder your hair looks the more money you get. What? Now Franz, it is not that funny. I believe you laugh at the way I look. - Now, now Didi. You are not going to be in the same bad humor all evening? No. I'll be alright after I get a drink. Good. I will order dinner and have them call us at the bar, shall I? And not too soon. Didi, darling. - Sylvia. How sweet. Could you possibly sew this on? Yes. It won't take a moment. - Thank you so much. You can sit here. I was just leaving. The beastly rain. It ruins my hair. Yes. You'll have to be careful how you look now you're in the papers again. Really? Don't tell me that you didn't see the keyhole column? I was going to send it to you, darling. Were you? We thought it frightfully amusing. "Which of our most frequently divorced socialites .." "Is going places with that good-looking maestro?" "Can it be she is trying to improve her technique?" "A musical, of course." There should be laws against that sort of thing. If I was this maestro I'd give that fellow a black eye. Oh my dear, can't you just see the headlines? "Franz Roberti socks columnist." "Over crack at Didi Widener Stokesbury Lennox Smith." Darling, you have a marvellous memory for names. Yes. Yes, haven't I. Here is your slipper, Miss. Excuse me, Miss. Is there anything I can do for you? Oh. Thank you very much. Where you going, lady? Johnny, take me home. - We just got here. I know we did but I want to go home. Oh. Alright. I'll get my coat. It won't take a second. Johnny. - Franz. Well .. darling. Hello Franz. What is going on here? No sooner do it turn my back than I find my wife out with another man. Well, that's the way things go. But he is a pretty disappointed man. We came and now we go home. - Oh? Constance isn't feeling well. - Really? What's the matter? It's nothing. I am fine. That's fine then. We can all have dinner together. But I have already had my dinner. Yes. I am on my way back to rehearsal. Well, remember. Not too late home. And you. Remember whose wife you have got with you. I am sorry, Monsieur. But the chef regrets there is no Pompano. No what? - No Pompano. The fish you ordered for dinner, Monsieur. There is none. - The fish? I ordered no fish. I've had my dinner. You have made a mistake. Well I must hurry now. I'll get my coat. Goodnight. Franz. Sylvia wants us to dine with them and then go to Bunny's later. You say we can't. - Hello, Franz. Oh, Ducky. You and Didi must join us. I am sorry. Mrs Lennox Smith, Mrs Dewitt - my wife. How do you do. Oh. Well, you will come along too won't you, Mrs Roberti? I am sorry but I am going to the theater. Oh yes, but some other time then. Thank you very much. Constance, we have got to be going. - Goodnight. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Franz. Constance. Constance. Where are you going? - I don't know. Then why ..? - It is over, Franz. You and me. We are finished. Please let me go before I say the things I want to. But you must understand. It was nothing. - Nothing? You lied to me. You were afraid to let me know. Don't touch me! I'm sorry, Franz. It's alright. I am going. I won't have you go. You are my wife. - Your wife? That is not enough for me. Why did you marry me, Franz? Because I loved you. - You shouldn't have done it. You were right. Beautiful things don't last. Remember saying that to me? I didn't know what I was saying. - Oh, yes you did. You were honest then. You could look me in the eye and tell me the truth. I wasn't your wife then. You didn't have to lie to me. Well, I am not your wife anymore. You can be honest again. Come now, Franz. Smile. Be happy. You don't have to sneak around corners anymore. You don't have to lie and pretend. You can be yourself. You are Franz Roberti again. I won't let you go. Let me? Goodbye. Say, you know this ain't a bad number. Get somebody to run it over for me, can you. Jerry. Get me that same girl I had before. You know, the new one. She is good. - Lauren? Yeah. - She is out to lunch. Okay. You know with a full orchestra I will slay this number. You don't need an orchestra. I know. But an orchestra helps. Jerry. Yeah? Jerry, would you run this over for me? - Sure I will. Helen, look after things for me, will you. I'll be back in a minute. I beg your pardon. No song-pluggers. You got me wrong. I can't even carry a tune. Hardly anybody that comes in here can. Now what's on your mind? - I want to see Mrs Roberti. Who? Mrs Roberti. Mrs Franz Roberti. Oh. Oh yes. She has just gone out to lunch with Mr and Mrs Beethoven. What would Mrs Roberti be doing here? - Well, she works here. Not here she doesn't. You had better try the Metropolitan Opera house. Oh. Well, thanks anyway. A nice-looking fellow. Say .. it is your lunchtime. You will be due back before you get started. I wasn't hungry. I thought I would just finish up this stuff. Now look here. It's none of my business and you can tell me to go peddle my papers. But you are riding for an awful fall. I am alright. - Yes, you are. Not. You've only been here two months and you're all ready to fall apart. Now snap out of it, kid. I don't know what is worrying you. But it isn't worth it. - Okay. Jerry wants those. I'm alright. Don't worry about me. Well .. it's your funeral. Mr Roberti's apartment please. Yes please. Franz. Mr Roberti, please. What? When? I'm very sorry, but he sailed for Europe this morning. Miss Thorne. Miss Thorne. I tell you it's terrific. It's the best thing since "Yes, We Got No Bananas." It will kill 'em. - Really? Play this for Mr Lubin. And it don't cost nothing to do. All we need is some fans and some girls of course. Mr Lubin wants this for his new show. So, give it everything you've got. Let it go, honey. "My blues are over at last." "They are just a thing from the past." "I'm not the person that I used to be." "Just take a look at what love has done for me." "I am happy-go-lucky. I'm happy to say I'm lucky." "Lucky because I'm happy I'm in love." "Happy go lucky. Everything is simply ducky." It is stupid. Okay, Harry. But I've got another number I want you to hear. If it's like that one I don't want to hear it. You must hear this other number. Get rid of the Thorne girl. You ought to hear what she did to happy-go-lucky. She can't play for buttons. I'm sorry to bother you again. - Hello. But does a Miss Dane work here? A Miss Constance Dane? You've got another wrong number. Could I speak to the manager? Maybe he'd know. I have charge of all the girls here. I would know. It certainly is strange. He told me this was the place. Wait a minute. Have you got a girl here that is about so tall. And she has got sort-of auburn hair and green eyes? Yeah. - Yeah? About ten of them. No, wait a minute. This one is very slender. She never looks as if she's walking. She sort-of glides. And her eyes, they all crinkle up if she laughs. Only she doesn't laugh too much. And she has got a very low voice. And she's sort-of quiet and reserved and she doesn't bother much about others. You must mean Madeline Thorne. - Yes. Where is she? Down there. Third door to your left. - Oh, thanks a lot. Constance. Hey, somebody! Get a doctor, will you. Well, was it good? Not only good, it was great. Wait until next month. In Munich. Then you will hear an orchestra. Bills, bills. Invitations. Bills. And nothing worth reading. No word from Constance? No. It is not right. You should ask her to take you back. I did ask her back. - When? The night she left me. But then she didn't know what she was doing. I don't understand you, Franz. You love her and yet .. - Well, in spite of that .. Life must go on. But suppose she is in need? - Ah, that doesn't worry me. Her bank account was filled. Franz, let me go home. Let me try to find her. Let me explain to her. What is there to explain? I was foolish. I told her that. No-one else ever meant anything to me but her. That, she knows. But life .. is not .. Some .. Some girlish dream. That too I tried to explain to her. She was too proud to face life as it really is. Well. I have my pride too, Thalma. I can't beg her to come back. I want her but only if she wants to come. Franz, you don't understand. Constance is not like you and me. She lives in a little world all of her own. I know. And when it becomes too lonely in that little world. She will know how to reach me. I am not so difficult to find. Come in. May I come in? - Of course. Lady Phyllis Cameron, my old friend and teacher, Professor Thalma. How do you do. I will see you tonight, Franz. Au revoir, Madame. Sit down, Phyllis. I will be ready in a moment. You see. I am not taking any chances with you, Roberti. I have come to fetch you in person. I'm not going to have my guests disappointed. I know you English women. And your determination. You promised them Roberti and Roberti they shall have. Exactly. But she is lovely. Yes. Yes. You have excellent taste. As the French so delicately put it .. A prot?g?? Constance? No. You might have said that about .. Any other woman I have ever known. Except yourself of course. But not Constance. She is my wife. You must meet her someday. She is a very great person. I shall be delighted to. This cable was downstairs. I thought maybe .. Great news. From Constance? - No. From Pazzini. He wants us back. Some special concerts. When do we leave? - We'll leave immediately after Munich. Have you ever been to New York? - Yes. Often. Then you must understand our excitement. Cheer up old friend. By the new year, we will be home. Come on everybody. Happy New Year. Constance, you're early. - Alright then. Happy Old Year. Johnny, you are drinking water. Certainly. I always drink just one drop of water on New Year's eve. It gives me such a feeling of superiority. That's a very nasty attitude. I won't have you feeling superior to me. I'll show you the kind of girl I am. I won't take another drink this year. How much time have I got? - Fifteen minutes. I will stick to my word. Don't say I haven't got willpower. I want to dance. I want to dance. Well. Dance with me. Bill, excuse me a minute please. Constance. I am so glad. Franz, I heard you were back. And just here where I didn't expect it. And you look well. Constance, this is marvellous. A celebration. Come, I will buy you a drink. A reunion at the bar. Two Sidecars, Rico. - Right away, Miss Dane. And use the Courvoisier brandy please. Where did you learn? I have improved greatly, Franz. You will be proud of me. I know how to order all the right drinks in all the right places. Do you? Happy New Year, Connie. Happy New Year, Joe. - Hiya, Connie. Hi. Well, you've made a lot of friends. - Yeah. I've been around. Never mind about them. It is this that is important. That we meet again. Constance, I was so angry with you when you went away. You know, I stayed in that apartment for two whole weeks. Waiting for you to call. And when you didn't call I got angrier. I know, Franz. You were never used to being kept waiting were you. If you knew how much I've wanted you. And now, seeing you again. I know, darling. You must come back to me. Oh, Franz. Please, let us go home. Constance, darling. What do you say we .. Oh, hello Franz. Hello. I heard you were back. Johnny, get my purse will you? It's in the dining-room. Sure. Let's get out of here. Let's go home. Look at me, Franz. How can you be so blind? Don't you know I am not the same woman who left that apartment? You look the same to me. - No, I'm not. I'm very different. I'm like you now. - Like me? I am part of this. This is part of me. Did you think I would stay lonely, Franz? Did you think I had no capacity for life? Do you think I couldn't enjoy this world of yours? The game. The way you play it? You were wrong, Franz. You taught me your lesson too well. It's been fun, Franz. Great fun. Drink to the things I have learned. How to live, how to be gay. To life. To love. To all the things you taught me. I didn't teach you. Well, to the things life teaches then. What difference does it make? Anyway, let's drink. Well, how about my dance? Of course, Bill. Constance. Happy New Year. Happy New Year, Johnny. Well, Pazzini. Has he come? No. No. I phoned his hotel again. They say he left there two hours ago. I know that. I know that. Where did he go? - I don't know. Hurry. Find him. Find him. There is an audience waiting. Well, I suppose he'll show up before the night is over. Not here yet? I wish they would hurry. I'm catching the 11:22. Extraordinary delay. Musicians always make a fuss if the audience are late. I notice they don't mind holding things up themselves. I've never known them to be so late in starting before. Mr Pazzini. He is here. Gentlemen. Happy New Year. Roberti. How dare you! You are drunk. What? Of course I am drunk. Beyond that, my dear Mr Pazzini. I am very drunk. Though .. not so drunk. As I intend to be. If you cannot appear, your contract is broken. I will dismiss the audience. You will do nothing of the kind, Pazzini. This is my concert. You understand? They have come here to hear me conduct. Not to listen to speeches from you. Franz, Franz. He is right. My boy, you can't go out there like this. It is alright, Maestro. They have paid to see Roberti. And Roberti they shall see. Where is the stage? And what are we playing? Oh. Pazzini. A baton for you too. Leave me alone! I am Franz Roberti. I am Franz Roberti. Stay still, Franz. Please. You will never conduct again, I promise you. Never has there been such a scandal. You've ruined not only yourself but .. You don't understand. I am Mrs Roberti. Who is it? Mrs Roberti. Let me in! He is alright. He is alright. My dear Mrs Roberti. Oh, your dear Mrs Roberti? So yours too, eh? Franz, please. Please don't. He is ill. Leave me alone with him. No! Stay here! There are some of you perhaps, gentlemen .. Who do not know my wife. You .. and you .. and you. No? Why then .. go. Don't hang back. Don't be afraid. Franz! Forgive me. I understand. It is my presence that makes it awkward. Very well then. I am going. Make yourselves perfectly free, gentlemen. My wife .. will entertain you much better than I. I invite you all to stay. Make yourselves at home. I was so worried. Where have you been? Walking. Making my head clear. Though I don't know what for. Henderson. Franz. Is there something I can do? Nothing, thank you. Bring the whiskey. Yes, sir. You can't go on like this, Franz. Get some sleep. And in the morning we'll go to see Pazzini and then to rehearsal. After tonight? - What kind of talk is this? This was one night. Before that there were ten years. - Don't talk about it. I am through with rehearsals, through with conducting. Through with music. A musician is never through. Well I am. Don't you understand, Thalma? I had .. just one thing. I threw that away myself. Now I have nothing. You talk foolishness. You are no different now than before you me her. Oh no. I was empty then. Yes. But I didn't know it. Now. I do. That is what makes it different. Loving her as I did. Having her love me. Gave me the only thing that was important. All that mattered. Was this love between us. And I killed it. Now it is gone. It is dead. - Franz. It is dead, Thalma. In both of us. The court of the State of Nevada is now in session. Yes, Your Honor. Grand Central in about an hour. - Thank you, porter. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Is you all Miss Dane? - Yes. Right here, boy. Miss Dane. Miss Dane. Miss Dane. Johnny. - Hello, Connie. I'll be with you in just a minute. Boy, that's fine. Thank you very much. Johnny, you blessed fool. I am so glad to see you. I'm glad to see you too, Connie. You look swell. I feel swell. What's new? - Nothing, except you are back. Look, these are the plans for our new house. Do you like it? - Our new house? Yeah. Very interesting. It's green, isn't it. Yes. Here's the tennis court. The house is over here. We hadn't room enough to get it in the picture. Hey, Connie. What size ring do you wear? Pick one out. Johnny, I hate to seem presumptuous, but is this a proposal? Bright girl. You can take a hint. It don't need a house to fall on you. Johnny, you are so sweet. No sentimentality. Say, I forgot, we're in a hurry. We've got to sail on the Berengaria Thursday. Here is the license. - But, Johnny. Don't argue with me, woman. I am in no mood for quibbling. Say, by the way did I tell you I was glad to see you? Yeah. That's good. I like to get the formalities out of the way. Johnny, are you serious about all this? Why, of course I am serious. You hadn't considered marrying anybody else had you? Darling, as a matter of fact I hadn't even considered marrying you. Yeah. I know. I thought I'd have a good chance if I brought the matter up suddenly. If I took you by surprise, swept you off your feet. Johnny. You know that I like you better than anyone I've ever known. That's good. And I guess I love you enough for both of us. Come along, Connie. Just for the laughs, huh? Is that what it would mean? I don't know, Constance. Frankly, it worries me. I've got an awful hunch that with you around I might amount to something. Well, there is no harm trying is there. Why don't you say it is alright? Don't you see? It isn't just me. It is going to make Johnny happy. But he is not a musician. Neither am I. I found that out too. I don't think I ever could have been really. I worked out there. Honestly worked. And no music would come. If I had been a real musician, out of all that mess would have come something. Perhaps I wasn't born to be a musician, but to love one. How is he? Constance I am a foolish old man. But because I love you both I wanted you to go on together. But I see now that I was wrong. Will you do one thing for me? - Yes. What? See him. Oh, no. No. What good would it do? We have nothing to say to each other. We have said everything. Please, Constance. - Oh, why? We've hurt each other as much as two people can. It is for his sake that I ask you, Constance. Maybe you could do something? Say something that would help. He is not in trouble? Where is he? Let me talk to him alone. Franz. I didn't know. Thalma just told me. Oh, my dear. What has happened to you? Listen, Franz. You can't go on like this. It is not worth it. Don't you know that? Nothing is worth this. Franz. What you have done to me. What I have done to you. None of that matters. The important thing is you are Roberti. The great Roberti. You are, Franz. I know it. I've heard you put things into music that no-one ever dreamed. My dear. It is not for what we were but for what we might have been. Franz. Franz. "Don't you know .." "Beautiful things don't last." "I would like to see you again and again." "And perhaps again." "I don't want to make you unhappy." "I couldn't be unhappy now." "I love you." "If you knew how much I have wanted you." "Now, seeing you again, I know." "You want to go back to all that, don't you, Franz." "Don't be afraid, darling. We shall still be alone together." "In our hearts." Now I know. And I will make you know. Somehow I will make you know. Somehow. Stop! That is her music. Franz. Thalma. Thalma! He needs me. He needs me, Johnny. It's where I belong. It's where I want to be. Constance, look. I'm not just thinking of myself. Honestly. - I know. But. You must think what you are letting yourself in for. But you don't .. - No, Constance. You've got to listen to me. You didn't have so much happiness with him before, did you. And what's it going to be like now? With a man that .. Why, you don't even know that he wants you. Think, Constance. Think of the years ahead of you. I know, Johnny. That doesn't matter. There is nothing he can say or do that matters. We love each other. We always will. It isn't anything you can explain or .. fight against. I can't make it any clearer than that. No. I guess you can't. I guess he is sort-of like the hives. 0nce you've got 'em, you've got 'em. Johnny. You are so grand. Well? Go out to them, darling. They want you. They want you. It is you they are applauding. But they don't know it. -(t-g)-
