[music playing] [music playing] FRANK: Hey, Johnny! [camera clicks] Frank! [laughter] [music playing] Sir, will you take a quick photo? FRANK: Thank you. [inaudible] [music playing] Right! [camera clicks] [music playing] [telephone rings] [telephone rings] Frank Meadows. It's me, Megan. Good God. MEGAN (ON PHONE): It's Johnny-- he's been arrested. [door clicks] [door closes] Hello, Johnny. (CRYING) Hello, Frank. Johnny, if only you'd confided in me. If I'd known how much you needed money, I'd have helped. t after you said no, that's why. I was angry, that's all. I don't blame you, Frank. Really I don't. I'd had enough money off you by then already. I wanted to make me own. Your own? Housebreaking? Frank you couldn't do us a favor could you? Don't ask me to help that cow, Megan. It's all her fault, anyway. If she hadn't stopped you seeing me-- She gets jealous. That's where it is. I suppose she put you after it in the first place. No. She never knew nothing. You will be careful saying things like that. What is it you want me to do for you, Johnny? I'm worried about Evie. Evie? JOHNNY: My dog. I didn't know you had a dog. Well, you ain't been around much lately. Well, I got her off this bloke. Well she's not properly-- She's young, you know. Honest, Frank, she's a beauty. What I want you to do is, like, look after her. For now while I'm away. You could do that, couldn't you? Johnny, I couldn't possibly. I don't know anything about dogs, for a start, nor do I want to. Well, she could live there. You know, with you at your place. Dogs have to be fed, and taken for a walk. I'm out all day. But you could-- you can feed her. Take her for walks when you come home, like, of an evening. Johnny I don't always come home at night. Megan can keep her, can't she? Hm? Nah. She's got Rita, and Dickie. Anyway, she'll have to go out to work now, same as me. I think the world of her. Yes, I thought you'd changed your tune a little. There was a time when you called her everything under the sun. No, not Megan, Evie. Anyway she don't want to witness that. Sod it. I don't know what to do for the best [inaudible], Frank. She's expecting. I thought you said she was a young dog. No, not Evie. Megan. Again? Oh, for Chrissake, Johnny. And behind rent. And I'll be inside for years. Christ. Come on. Come on. First offense and all that. More like months. (LAUGHING). How much rent do you owe? Oh, I don't know. A couple of months, I think. Look, I'm sorry I can't take your dog, but I'll see you don't lose your home. Of course I will. You're the only pal I've got. And I won't ever let you down. Not anymore. That's a promise. [kiss] Johnny, look, whatever I do, I do for you. [door closes] MILLIE: Tom never liked her. Welsh. He says you can't trust the Welsh. Well, I agree. We can't trust her, but Megan's hardly Welsh. Welsh stock, he means. Why he ever married her, I do not know. MILLIE: Mm. I warned him. But when he was living with her and that awful daughter of hers-- what's her name? Rita? Mm. It was bad enough then, but at least he could come to see me. Come to see you, too, of course. A free man. Then they had Dickie. She started to put the pressure on. Now they're married, she's taken over his very soul. What's done's, done. That's what I say. Johnny's found out he can get someone that will defend him for three guineas. That's his right, they say. I'll pay that. You're good to him, Frank. I'm just sorry that this has happened, Millie. Not your fault. Megan wants Tom and me to take Dickie off her hands, so she can work. You've got a job, too. That's what I said! He could go to a minder, mind, while I'm out. Then, again, I can't afford it. Can I help? You've done enough. Thirty bob a week do? Oh. Right. Well, look. What I'm saying is, if you help me with Dickie, you've got to come and visit. I won't take now't else. Oh, of course, Millie. I'd-- I'd love to. We haven't seen much of you since Johnny left home. Well, if you hadn't married Tom and gone to live on the other side of London, you'd still be [inaudible], wouldn't you? [laughing] Right. Oh, I gotta go. Tom will be wanting his tea. Oh, yes. Been lovely seeing you, love. -And you, Millie. -Bye-bye. Mind [inaudible]. -Yes. Be all right. I hope so. [door opens] Hello, Frank. Hello, Johnny. Couldn't do us a favor, could you? Get us some cigs. [inaudible] in here. You all right otherwise? Megan comes and sees me every day, pretty well. Well, yes, I know. I came today because she couldn't. She's sorry for what she'd done. She told me. [clears throat] She said she won't ever open letters no more. Anyway, she won't stop me seeing you. I told her I'm going away with you and [inaudible] when this stuff's over. And she don't mind. She thinks the world of you now. Frank, [inaudible] it for me, won't you? Blokes in here reckon I won't get no more than six months. With good conduct, maybe four months. [inaudible] One year. [music playing] [knocking on door] MILLIE: Frank! [dog barking] A very special visitor, so give him a big smile. Look who's come to see you! [crying] Oh, Dickie! Come on, say hello, Dickie. [crying] FRANK: Hello, Dickie. Say hello to Frank, Dickie. Aw. [crying] Hello, Tom. Don't like you much, does he? [laughing] [inaudible] [dog barking] I presume that's Johnny's dog out there. TOM: I could kill him. We didn't have to go and fight in the war to come back and stand in bloody queues. You know, I said to old Sid, the butcher-- You can fight no one. You is too old. Anyway, I made biscuits, Tom. Will you get it. Oh, this is just [inaudible]. [baby crying] Tom had to get Evie's meat. Well, how is that working out-- minding Evie. I'm worming her, you know. [baby crying] [inaudible] There were no one else. FRANK: Worms? Already? Every dog has worms. They're born with them. I'll tell you the best thing for worms-- human hair, chopped up in treacle. And tobacco's not bad for worms, either. I know what I'm talking about. I had a dog, he used to eat up all the back-ends all the way along the street. And if you saw one still burning, if you stamp it out, and eat that up and all. Eh. Kept herself clear of worms all her life, she did. Yes. And I'll tell you something about dogs-- I suppose that's why they call them dog ends. Heh. That's very funny. [dog barking] [baby crying] We've got visitors, so we had to shut her out, like. FRANK: I really must go, Millie. More in the pot, Frank. I must. Here, Frank-- you see Tom's slippers? I gave them to him for his birthday. Feels the cold, you see. [laughing] See him coming, go away. [laughing] Oh. He's not a healthy man. Still having problems with his back? Worse than ever. Don't know where to put hisself sometimes. He never was a strong man, mind, if you want to know the truth. Not up to the standard of your first husband, eh Millie? No. Not like my first one. No. Johnny's dad. Johnny's took after him, fit as a flea. As a matter of fact, I turned Tom down in favor of him. But he don't give up, Tom don't. I'll say that for him. So, when I lost my first, he was ready, like-- to be my second. Patience rewarded. [dog whimpering] Always liked that photo, didn't you, Frank? It suited him, the Navy. Dear Johnny, the cause of all our troubles. Now don't say that. I won't have nothing said against him. Only a joke, Millie. MILLIE: It was nice to see you. [music playing] [phone rings] Yes? It's me, Megan. Well? I had a visit to Johnny yesterday. How is he? MEGAN (ON PHONE): He's well. He says he's counting the days. He says. He says, uh, the evenings are the worst. He says could you send him some books? What sort of books? He said you'd know what he likes. Oh, all right then. Anything else? MEGAN (ON PHONE): He sends you his best. I'll be right in tomorrow. Shall I give him a message? Give him my love. [phone clicks] And you can stick that in your pipe and smoke it. If you want books, why didn't you write to me? -[inaudible] -Yes, please. Oh, I'll have this one, too. Sorry. [bell rings] Oh. [inaudible] Hold! Damn! [music playing] Tickets here. Next, please. [music playing] Oh, did you get the money all right? Yes. Of course. But you should've visited. You promised you would. Hello, Dickie. He still don't like you. [crying] Heard from Johnny? Expecting a letter any day now, aren't we, Dickie boy? Promises, promises. They don't allow much, do they? Well, he can get one visit a week, and he can send about one letter in a month. He's been in three months. Megan has the lot. He ought to write to you, it's true, after all you've done. I'm surprised you think she comes first, being his wife, under her condition. Under her condition. She's going to apply for extra visits on passionate grounds, so maybe we'll get to see him then. She was over here last Sunday-- her and Rita. They are a pair, aren't they? She tells me when she's gonna see him, I'll give her that. I like to give her a package of cigs to pass to him. It's not allowed, of course. But she manages somehow. And after, she tells me how he is. Mind you, she has an odd way with her. You know what I mean? A bit heartless. In fact, she don't say much at all, really. Perhaps she's shy. Sly she is. I always knew she'd do him no good. Welsh, you see. Can't trust the Welsh. FRANK: Well said, Tom. Welsh, I don't know. But she's certainly sly. Well. There was a time when Johnny said he was going to leave her. Now look. TOM: Oh, yeah. But she is his wife. She married him for better nor worse. You can't come between a man and his wife. I can. Ah, well-- That's enough from you. (WHISPERING) Millie-- Isn't it hot in here, Millie? Do you mind if I open this window a little? No. [dog whimpers] Good God! [laughter] She has grown, hasn't she? Evie! Out you go. Oh! Aw! [laughter] She likes you, don't she? She probably thinks you're Johnny. Oh, Millie. However do you manage? She can make a lot of work, and that's the truth. We can't leave nothing lying about, or she'll have it. Yeah. She had that teddy bear, you know. The lovely teddy what you bought Dickie. I meant to say sorry, Frank. I try to put everything away, but she's a devil. Oh, that's all right. I'm glad she got some fun out of it. Dickie didn't. Oh yes he did. After you'd gone that day, I had him playing with it. She needs a lot of exercise. Johnny's got a good one there, I'll tell you that. Ten or more puppies for every litter off of them. And I'm talking about 15 pound apiece. She hasn't been out for a day or two. [dog whining] She's got the yard, hasn't she? I'll take her out. Would you? Oh, I would be glad. She's grown so big. She-- she pulls. Oh, she does pull. All right. All right. Let's go. Here. Leash walk. Johnny would like that. Evie! Evie! Wait! Evie. Evie. Wait. Wait! Wait! Evie. All right. We're here. Now wait. Wait. Wait. Wait! Sit. Wait here. Good girl. Stay. Stay now. I'll let you off. You wait at the end with Frank, eh? Wait at the end of the alley. Evie! Wait! Wait! Wait for me! Evie! [music playing] Evie! [car horn honks] Evie! [dog whimpers] [sigh] [music playing] Wait. Wait! Evie! [dog barks] Good girl. Good girl! Good. [music playing] You're a pretty one. [music playing] Evie. Evie. Goodness me. Thought you'd got lost. Pulls, does she? Well, she doesn't like the lead, yeah. I let her go in the alley. I let her go as much as I could. She was as good as gold. I want to get one of them chain leads, you know. Nicks in the neck, chain leads, when a dog pulls. [inaudible] Well, she just doesn't like the lead, that's all. [music playing] You want something to eat, Frank? Must be hungry after all that exercise, I expect. No, I really must be going. Millie, it's not a quick journey. [kiss] Bye, Tom. Harry-- You've got a dog, haven't you? How big is it? Alsatian, sir. Or German Shepherd dog as some call it. Not a name I like I have to say, sir. How much exercise do you give it? At least two hours a day, sir. Thank you. [music playing] [dog whining] Thank you. [dog whining] [telephone ringing] Yes? MEGAN (ON PHONE): It's me, Megan. I saw Johnny yesterday. You've not been to see him again? I got an extra-- on compassionate grounds. Oh, is he ill? No, I'm expecting, aren't I? Oh yes. MEGAN (ON PHONE): He said to thank you for the books. They were smashing. Hello? Yes. He said to say he'd love some more. But that's the third lot. For heavens sake. I-- Isn't-- It's a prison library, isn't it? If Johnny wants something from me, he can write to me and ask me for it himself. He says he's writing. FRANK (ON PHONE): Good. He says you can write, too, if you want. But he's only allowed to receive letters in answer to ones that he has written. Oh, that's what they say. Letters often get through. The screws don't rumble. The what don't what? The wardens don't find out. Look, I've got better things to do than to write letters that may or may not arrive. Anything else? He misses his smokes. I smuggle a packet in when I go, of course, but that don't last him. That's stupid and dangerous. He might lose his good conduct remission. Anyway, I don't see what any of this has got to do with me. FRANK (ON PHONE): Anything else? He sends his best. He says you could write to him. [phone clicks] [phone clicks] Oh, damn. Oh damn. Oh damn. Oh, Millie. Millie, it's just not fair. You're a bit put out, aren't you, Frank? I could see you was when you come in. It's just-- It's not just that I want to see him or hear from him. Well, though, of course I do. Well, it's a matter of principle. He should not be granting her all those privileges, not after the way she's treated me. We don't understand Uncle Frank when he uses all them big words, do we, Dickie? Johnny's so blustered and weak. He promised me that when he comes out, well, things are going to be just like old times. But I want proof of that now, Millie. I need it! That means that he's got to give me visits and letters at her expense. He's got to make her give up something for me. Put her in her place. Right. [baby babbling] It's not that I am jealous. I'm not a jealous sort of person. If Megan will accept me, then I'm ready to accept her. DICKIE: Mama. Listen, Frank, he called me mum! What? I think Evie would like to come in. I'll let her in in a minute. So, I must tell you. Megan came round last Sunday week, and the way Dickie carried on, you should have heard him. He wouldn't have nothing to do with her. He wouldn't. And every time she'd go to pick him up, you should've heard him. Mum, he kept on crying, and holding out his little arms to me. Bless him. [laughing] Nothing would content him but I. And Megan saw. In the end, that's what we done. [inaudible] Oh he did howl. Oh, she said, you didn't want me no more, she said. You got another mum, is that it? You was a bad boy. Wasn't you, Dickie? [laughing] [baby babbling] He's looking at you, Frank. Look at him. Handsome little boy, isn't he? Smashing. MILLIE: He reminds me of Johnny when he was a baby. Johnny? Don't half miss him, don't you? I wish I could believe he misses me. Of course he do. I know about things he says. What things, Millie? Should we tell him or not? Millie, what things? He said one time you is the grandest fellow he's ever met. He thinks the world of you, Frank. I'm sorry he hasn't wrote now fixed a visit, but that don't mean he don't think of you. You worry too much. Are you sure she's all right, Millie? Her nose is feeling hot and dry. A bit constipated, that's all. Tom's given her some castor oil, some-- Perhaps she doesn't get out enough, hm? Millie-- how many times has she been out since I was last here? Well, two or three times. But that's in over a month. That's dreadful! No wonder she's constipated. To tell you the truth, most nights, Tom just don't fancy taking her out. He's all tired when he comes home from work, and then he has his tea. And he don't fancy going out again. He's not a well man, you know, Frank. His back-- -Look, look. I'll take her out now. Oh, you don't have to do that. Come and have a nice cuppa. Tom will take her out later. Millie-- She's a very bad dog. She's a nice dog, and Dickie do love her, but I wouldn't be sorry to see the back of her, and that's the truth. So much damage. I can't leave her out in this yard, well, not with the washing out. She'll have it all on the floor in five minutes. What do you mean? You mean she doesn't even get the yard now? Well, when the washing's out, I can't-- Every day, I expect. She's got so much energy. It must have an outlet. That's all it is, Millie. She must have more exercise. I can't take her out anymore, Frank. She pulled me over the other day, out there in the street. [laughing] I forgot to tell you, Frank. The other day she had them slippers of Tom's-- you remember, them red ones. She chewed them up good and proper, she did. You should have seen Tom's face when he come home. He took his belt to her, he did. How disgusting. I said to him, I said, it's your fault, I said. You shouldn't leave them lying about. He was sorry later. Made a proper fuss of her, he did. How many times has he hit her? Nah. Gets a bit ratty when his back's bad. Yeah. But he's a kind man at heart, Frank, and he thinks the world of that dog. [music playing] FRANK: Evie! Evie, come on. Good girl. Come on, Evie. That's Tom Winder's dog, isn't it? Oh no, it's Johnny his stepson's, actually. -She's a beauty. -You like dogs? I'm a dog spotter. Yes. She doesn't get out much. No, I'm afraid she doesn't. I could take her out. I take old Sid's dog out, and he's a big bugger. Not for money, though, just because I really like the dog. [music playing] Out you go, Evie. Millie, I met this boy who said, um-- Know him. Tom's told me about him. [inaudible] No. What's against him? He seemed quite sensible to me. Johnny gave us Evie to look after. She's our responsibility. Well, ask him, Millie, will you when you next visit? Please do. [music playing] [kiss] Good night, Evie. [music playing] [dogs barking] Mags, dear. Change your mind about replacing that spaniel? No, no. I'm sorry, Alice. Not another dog. I was so upset. This is my cousin, Frank. -Dog owner? -No, not exactly. No. But there is a dog that I am concerned about, and Margaret has suggested that you might be able to advise me. [laughing] I have this very old friend, you see, and he's acquired this Alsatian bitch. The boy's in the Navy. And, um, well, he's gone off back to sea for months on end, and, uh, Millie, that's the boy [inaudible] and her husband. [inaudible] They've been stuggling through life and all, doing their best. [music playing] Oh, no. She's getting precious little exercise. In fact, no exercise at all. [music playing] If only she could be placed in good hands, you see. [inaudible]. Shoot her. I beg your pardon? Borrow a gun if you don't have one. And look, Mister, um-- Meadows. Dogs are much like people. The damage is done at the start, and by and large, it's irreversible. The poor bitch has obviously been cooped up, badly trained, probably badly treated. Yes, but, if you took her on, wouldn't she get better? They go neurotic. Bite. That sort of thing. Make the life of anyone who owns her absolute misery. Hence, my advice-- shoot her. JOHNNY (VOICEOVER): Dear Frank, I know you would do this for me, Frank, because I only [inaudible] a day and you can imagine how long that lasts me. And also, Frank, if you do this, I'll be able to go and get your letters out to you once a month. Well, Frank, how are you keeping? As for myself, I'm OK, but-- &quot;Megan thinks the world--&quot; Not one word about Evie. Well, Johnny, Megan does not think the world of me, and I'm afraid at this moment I do not think the world of you. [baby crying] I don't know what's the matter. I felt for a tooth, but I can't find one. FRANK: Well. Oh, well, now. Let's-- Let's see what I've got here for you. Hey? Oh, he likes you. Just listen to him-- da da da da, he's saying. Oh, well that'll never do. I mean, if you're his mum, I can't be his dad. Oh! [laughing] Put him in his pram, Frank. [laughing] Had your letter from Johnny yet, Frank? Yes, I've had a letter, but not the official visit letter that I was hoping for. Johnny didn't say anything, except asking me for five pounds to send to some school friend of his in return for smuggling in some tobacco. You never sent it. FRANK: I certainly did not. I thought it was rather a lot of money. You hear that, Tom? Yes. Must be going barmy. You might as well throw your money in that there fire as give it to one of them screws. Crafty bastards, they are. I remember one time, in the war-- Uh, Frank, I must tell you-- We're taking Dickie down to Margate for the weekend, aren't we, Dickie bird? Will you be taking Evie? No. She will stay here and guard the house. That's her job. When did he last take her out? Not once? Not at all? In a whole month? Evie! [dog barks] Evie! Evie. Good girl. Come on. Good girl. [thump] Don't do that! Good God, she's only playing. She'll have to learn how to behave. I Don't talk rubbish. Hey. Hey! [dog barks] No! Evie. Evie. [music playing] Evie! [dog barks] I'd stay away if I were you. Evie. [dog barks] Come on. Come on. Evie. My poor Evie. My poor, beautiful Evie. [kiss] Millie! Millie. I-- I've had a wonderful idea. Oh. What? This weekend, when you're in Margate. Hey! Hey! [dog barks] [music playing] [phone rings] Hello, yes? It's me, Megan. FRANK (ON PHONE): Oh, hi, yes. I was, uh, hoping that you would ring. Will you be writing to Johnny again soon? I'll be seeing him next week. Again? MEGAN (ON PHONE): Has he written to you? He said he would. I've had a letter, yes. Yes. But I expect you know what that was about. He said something about cigarettes. FRANK (ON PHONE): Anyway, that doesn't-- Um, tell Johnny that Evie is having an absolutely rotten life. She never gets out, and it's making her go to the bed. Are you listening? Yes, Frank. FRANK (ON PHONE): [inaudible] Anyway. Tell him that my idea of her going to kennels is absolutely the right one. Everyone is satisfied. Now tell him that. What shall I say about the cigarettes? Tell him I'm thinking about it. [phone clicks] Good girl, Evie. Good girl. Evie? Be good. Now be good. Be good. Stay where you are. Stay. Good night. [dog whines] [kiss] Get! Give it to me! Evie! Evie. [music playing] Evie's had a quite wonderful time. You should have seen her, Millie, crossing the whole of Hyde Park, delighting in her own youth and strength. You'd have understood more clearly what I mean about the wretched life she's been leading, and how frustrating it is for her. I'm sending you a telegram, but here's a letter as well, to say I would like to keep Evie a bit longer. Hey! Evie. Ah. [dog barks] [laughter] [dog barking] Wait! [inaudible]. Good girl. Come on. Hey. What are you doing? Evie, what are you doing? What a mess! What a mess! Hey, what-what-what-- You take this back. Go on. Take that back to the kitchen. You be good. Be good. Stay. Good girl. Now you stay. [door closes] [dog barking] Thank you, madam. There is a queue, sir. Everybody gets their turn. Yes. I-- I'm-- My father. He's not very well, I hate leaving him alone, and-- I'm sorry. I just wondered if I could possibly, uh-- [music playing] [pounding] Ah. Ah! Hello. What's this? You want one? Do you? Do you want one? I'll peel it for you. Here. I'll cut the top off. See? Good girl. I'm sure he's forgotten. Just like him, when somebody else is doing the cooking. FRANK (ON PHONE): Hello? You've forgotten, haven't you, Frank? Uh, what? BILL (ON PHONE): Deidre says it's not like you to [inaudible]. [dog slurps] What? Look, Bill, I'm-- Uh, I'm most awfully sorry. Evie! FRANK (ON PHONE): Sorry, Bill. I'll fight to save you a portion. Yes, it's rather difficult. You see, I'm-- rather tied up. Um. BILL (ON PHONE): [inaudible] I'm done up like a dog's dinner. But where's the other dog? It appears he has someone with him called Evie. Yes, a thousand apologies to Dei-- Deidre. Good night, Bill. Evie! Goodnight. Evie! Evie. [music playing] [baby laughing] TOM: All right. Come on, Evie. Out you go. I'm sorry this put you out, my keeping Evie a day longer. You promised faithful that you'd bring her back last Monday. And you broke your promise. And I won't never trust you again. I made no faithful promise, Millie. I just said I'd bring her back on Monday, and then I thought I'd keep her a day longer, that's all. You got my telegram, didn't you? My letter? Johnny gave us Evie to look after, and he said no one else was to have her. And we've kept her all through this winter. We've looked after her. Fed her. And Evie's been all right. Millie, did you get my letter? I got your insulting letter, yes. Since you think this house so horrid, and nasty, and not fit for a dog to live in, I'm surprised you even set foot in it yourself. And you're not called upon to do so no more. I'm sorry if I've upset you. I know my John is in prison without you keep throwing it in my face. Since he is a prisoner himself and knows what loss of freedom means, he would not be so cruel as to condemn his dog to a similar fate. I won't have no one calling him cruel, for a more tender-hearted boy never lived. Millie, I just want him to agree to keep Evie in proper kennels where she can-- She's all right here. But she's never taken out, and that's not good. You've said so yourself. And if Johnny knows that, well-- He doesn't. You haven't told him? Tom's told him different. Oh, I see. Tom's been lying to him. There weren't no need to worry the boy. He's got enough to worry about already. He'll have plenty more if that dog bites his baby. I'll go now. Goodbye. Is your mother in? [knocking on door] Hello. Good job I didn't listen to Rita. Oh, I can't do nothing with you. What did he say? He said he'd be sending you a visit soon. He doesn't know about Edie. He said he'd soon be out to look after her himself. What? Five months? Four. Heh. Four, then. That's a hell of a long time to a dog, you know. I don't understand. I just don't understand. What's wrong with the dog, anyway? Did you hear what I said to you on the phone that time? About her not going out? She's been out, hasn't she? Right around your place. You think exercise once in six months is enough? Did Tom and Millie tell you to say nothing to Johnny about Evie? No. You know, Tom's been telling him that he takes Evie out regularly. No. But you were there when they visited. I mean, you all visited Johnny together. I don't listen to old Tom droning on. What do you think of Tom? He doesn't like me, I know that. He doesn't like me, either. You know what it is? He's jealous. That's what. Of me? Well, it's his own fault. I mean if he treated the bitch better, she'd like him instead of me. No. Millie. He thinks you're after her. What on earth do you mean? You kiss her, don't you? He doesn't like that. Once I heard him say, &quot;I'll knock his block off if I see him do that again.&quot; Look, Johnny's mad if he thinks he can keep her. She's pretty wild, you know. When he's out at work. Think of it! Do you think he'd sell her to me? Why do you want her if she's no good? I don't. I mean-- I mean-- I can't keep her any more than Johnny can. I've tried. I'm just sorry for her, that's all. I can't bear to think of her, well, loneliness. If I ever got her, I'd fix her up somewhere where she'd be-- she'd be-- be all right. Ask him. I'll ask him, Frank. But I don't think he'll sell her. He's soppy about her, you know. He only has to say her name and tears run down his face. He thinks the world of that dog. MILLIE (VOICEOVER): Dear Frank, Thank you for your welcome letter. I am entirely to blame for going off at you like that, and I am really sorry. Dickie's not been at all well these last few days. I think it's his teeth, and I think I shall have to take him to the doctor, as he has a lump like an egg on his-- Don't sicken me with revolting lumps. Oh, but what about Evie? Oh my God, what a crew. I must get a visit. I must talk to Johnny. [dog whining] MILLIE (VOICEOVER): Johnny gave us Evie to look after, and he said no one else was to have her. [music playing] [dog barking] [dog whining] [music playing] It is conspiracy. I should be [inaudible] to take that poor dog out. Millie, I am so sorry to hear [inaudible] is not well. And I hope the medicine you are getting will-- MILLIE (VOICEOVER): I shall be at home on Saturday, and you will be most welcome to come, but not on Sunday, as we are going over to Megan's. I'm afraid you will not be able to take Evie out for a while, as she is not well. Not well! (SHOUTING) They're killing her! Harry, when does the bitch go on heat? Well done, Megan! Ha! Arthur Newby? I want to see Johnny Brennan, not Arthur bloody Newby! MEGAN: What did you send it back for? FRANK: Well, because it was wrong, of course. There's boys in there, see, they're a long way from home, so they don't get visits much. They sell their visits to the boys from London, for six and that. On visit days, there's hundreds of people coming and going. Those guards don't know who's visiting [inaudible]. You mean if I turned up to see this Arthur Newby fellow, Johnny would have appeared? I could have seen him? [inaudible] What did I do? I-- It's how I think. It's how I'm trained! Do you see, it's, uh-- I mean, it happens all the time at work. When something's wrong, I point it out. I write a letter about it. And I ask for it-- What? God. I've got him into trouble. Johnny's smart. He'll talk his way out of it. He might lose his good conduct remission. They might put him in solitary. Bread and water. Damn. Damn! Cuppa tea? What? Oh yes. Thank you. [radio playing] What are you drawing, Rita? [inaudible] I don't think you'll get hold of that dog again, you know. What? MEGAN: Something Tom said. What did Tom say? Tom said, that dog doesn't leave my house again. Damn him! Damn Tom! I'll put the RSPCA onto him, and then we'll see. If only I could see Johnny. If only I could. We could sort it all out. If you get a visit before I do, could I go with you? If you don't mind. I don't mind, Frank. I'm always home about 6:00. Ring me. You're supposed to sign your register. Oh, look, you sign it. Where? [inaudible] Ring me, damn you. [phone rings] Hello? Mister who? Oh, I-- Sorry, Miss Sweeting. This is an awfully bad line. What? No, I have not shot her yet, Miss Sweeting. [music playing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [knocking] Ring me! I want my visit! [knocking] There you are. I've just been to see Johnny. - Why didn't you phone me? - I did. You were out. Well, you must have applied pretty quickly. I didn't. It was the official visit. Yes. Of course. I'd forgotten! Hence the fiddle with Arthur bloody Newby. What? Oh, I just wish. If you'd give up one official visit for me. Will he sell Evie to me? No. [jiggling door] [knocking on door] You were so right. Oh, God. You were so right. They wouldn't let me take her out at all. Not at all. See? See Millie-- Millie says that Johnny says that neither I, nor anyone else, can take her out of the house until he sends her on himself. Why? Why? Why would he say that? Perhaps so as not to upset them. Oh. What is all this bosh about not upsetting anyone? He's not going to be upset. They're not going to be upset. You're certainly not going to be upset. The only one that doesn't matter is the poor bloody dog. I refuse to believe that Johnny would say anything like that. They had a letter off him. They told me when I was at their place Sunday. You were there? You were-- What did they say to you? They never said nothing. Well they must have said something. They never said nothing. You all sat their like mutes? They never said nothing. Did you see her? Um-- Evie, I mean, is she all right? She was all right. RITA: I don't know if I could manage another egg. Look, I, uh, I must ask you if I can go with you when you go to see Johnny on the next official visit. Tom and Millie are coming. I promised. What's it matter? It's only a dog. [music playing] MEGAN (VOICEOVER): It's only a dog. [music playing] It's only a dog. JOHNNY: Hello, Frank. Hello, Johnny. JOHNNY: How are you keeping? All right. I'm all right. How are you? JOHNNY: [inaudible], but I'm minding myself, you know. You seen her lately? Megan. No, no. I haven't. I-- I'm sorry. I should have. Oh, I had a letter across. That was three days back. We shall have a boy, I expect, you know. They say he's smashing, the nurses in there. I mean to have him christened Frank. Well, that's very sweet of you. Here we are at last, Johnny. I'm pleased to see you. I'm pleased to see you, too, Frank. I'm sorry not to have seen you before. It was not that I hadn't thought about you, because I have a lot. But, uh, if I could please everyone, I couldn't do no better than that, could I? I've done my best. Mum said you'd, uh, fallen out a bit. And she said about you, uh, taking Evie longer than you said you would. Well, there was a bit more to it than that. You made things a bit awkward. That's where it is. I mean, she has to live with Tom, don't she? And you made things a bit awkward. Sure that it's about Evie? I've been trying to tell you about it for months. It's been so difficult alone. About her not going out. But Tom said he took her out. That was a lie. Didn't Megan tell you that it was a lie? She did tell you? You knew. Look. Look, I couldn't do nothing in here, could I? You could have let me take her to the country, to the kennels. [inaudible] to be fair. I couldn't take her away from them. Well, Millie's always said she was a nuisance. She was fond of her, really. Tom was, too. I'll tell you, he thinks the world of that dog. No. He thrashed her. And he was too bloody lazy even to take her out for a walk. I-- I told him not to hit her. Well, he did hit her. Well, he ain't himself. That's where he is. You know, he's been at the hospital. You know that trouble with his back [inaudible]. They say it's a growth. It's bad. Frank, [inaudible]. All right, [inaudible]. Anyway. How's Evie now? Oh, they haven't let me see her for months. They said you said I wasn't to. You didn't say that, did you Johnny-- No, Frank, I didn't. That was a lie about what you said about the RSPCA. I knew when Rita came out with it. I said I know. You'll never be able to keep her here. Johnny, she's a wild beast. We'll manage, don't worry. Things are going to be all right, uh-- Johnny, between us, now, are they? Of course. I mean it will be the same as it was before. Don't be silly. Johnny, I'm frightened. Got any cigs on you, Frank? Turkish. Turkish? Can't afford to be fussy. [inaudible] hand them over. (WHISPERING) What? (WHISPERING) Let me have them. Let me have them. Thank you, sir. [dog whining] [crying] &quot;Dear Millie, Thank you for your last letter. I'm sorry to hear about Tom's trouble with his back again. I do hope he's out of hospital and on the road to recovery.&quot; [crying] FRANK (VOICEOVER): I went to see Johnny today, and he's bearing up well, though very impatient to be home with his family. He seems to be the same old Johnny, and I'm sure the time he's spent in prison will soon, soon be forgotten. I know that he's very grateful for all you've done for Dickie, and I expect that you're looking forward to having your house a little quieter and less crowded than it's been this year. [phone ringing] FRANK (ON PHONE): Frank Meadows. JOHNNY: Frank? It's me. I'm out. [music playing] [knocking on door] Hello, Frank. Johnny. I know you would stay on here, if you could. Come on, girl. Evie, come on. Why not leave her with me for the rest of the weekend? She'll be no trouble. You say the time. Monday morning, eh? I'll be on your doorstep, on the dot. You faithless woman. [music playing] Evie. Ah. Here we are. On the dot. MEGAN: Rita. Hm. There you go. Hm? It's a double. I've got a job now, working on a building. Oh. Good. Well. You won't want that then, will you? You're a good friend, Frank. I just want to see you get straight, that's all. How's home? Oh, little Frankie's growing a treat. He's not crawling, but he drags himself about. We're busy, you know. Megan called him David I noticed. I appreciated it, Johnny. Really. How's Evie? She's fine. Hey, do you want to sit down? Mm. You're not managing it, are you, Johnny? Hm? To get her enough exercise? No, not as much as I'd like. I'm leaving that early for work, you see. I'm getting home late. Oh, I'm just-- I'm knackered. I could take her out. It would be no trouble. Yeah. Well, the thing is, Megan's got a bit funny about that dog. She don't like me going out with her. She is? Well, I could collect her in the evening. Take her for a walk. Keep her overnight. And then she'd get another run in. Oh, well I'll bring her back to your place in the morning, you know, first thing. Hm? Before I go to work. You don't think I'm interfering, do you? No. No, of course not. I'm grateful. I was thinking about this other thing, you know the thing about her being put out to stud. I could find out about it. I could arrange it, even. Well, pay the fees. You know. Well, the puppies would be yours, of course. Well, of course. Um. Do you want another drink? [music playing] Evie's getting used to our routine, isn't she? In you go. Heh. I just wanted to check. Uh-- It is this weekend Johnny's keeping her? Is it? He doesn't ask me. Oh, right. I'll expect him over, uh, Sunday afternoon. If that's all right. He can keep her here, then, can't he? You pick her up Monday evening, same as usual. I'll be in central London Monday evening. [door slams] Why don't we go away together? You, and me, and Evie. That would be fine, wouldn't it, Johnny? Hm? Won't you? Come for a holiday? You need it. You always said you would. This is what she likes. Let her go. Good girl, Evie. Deidre? Thanks. Bill? [knocking on door] Just a minute. I've just been to Tom's funeral. How's the chap been? DEIDRE: Would you like a glass of wine? Yes. See you later. Johnny! Johnny? Johnny, what's the matter? I've been thinking about Tom. About the things he used to say. What particular things? He said I shouldn't of bought her in the first place. But then he didn't know about the other one. I had a dog when I was a kid. She-- My mum and dad did. She was called Evie. My dad got her for company in the [inaudible] all the times he didn't have no job. I loved her. I really did. Anyway, she, uh-- she took ill, or something wrong with her guts or something. She had to be put down. I was in a right state, I can tell you. But I don't remember all the details, but me mum said, you know, I wouldn't eat nothing for days. I pined that bad. So, anyway, last year I was down on my luck. You know, things really pissing me off, and I didn't know which way to turn, Frank, and that is a fact. Then I remember these pups I'd seen down to market. And I thought I'd buy a dog. I'll have my Evie again. I didn't have the cash. So you asked me for the loan. Oh, I don't blame you saying no. I got a few bob off you by then anyway, and I know you was getting annoyed about Megan and everything. You stole money to buy Evie? Yeah. And I went to prison. Didn't see her for near an half a year. I don't see much of her now, neither. Johnny, Johnny, you were greedy. You were greedy. Look, I'm not blaming you, Frank. I'm not. Look, Johnny, come up to the flat. You'll catch your death. I know Tom didn't quite tell me the truth of it when I was inside, but he meant well. He told me Evie really weren't getting the ideal life she needed. Because Tom said once, what dog lives like that? Not one in a thousand. Yeah, you see them all over, don't you, town dogs? Sitting outside shops, sitting outside houses. Bit of a walk now and then, but they're loved and they're cared for. In the most part. And Evie would have been like that. You know, I'd of cared for her. She'd have been all right. Lived to a ripe old age. Yeah, I know. I don't know a bit. See what I mean? Oh, yes, Johnny. I do see what you mean. That I should never have interfered. No. I didn't mean that. But everything was all right until I came along. Look, I'm not blaming you, Frank. I'm not. You've done your best. All I'm saying is-- That I've spoiled your life? [music playing] I'm sorry. Oh. [dog whining] RITA: He's gone out. What about your mother? She's gone round to her friends'. Then why aren't you round her friends'? I hate her friends? Where's Johnny gone? Don't know. They had words. Haven't you a key? Johnny. Johnny. Do what you've always promised me. Come away from all this. Just you, me, and Evie. It'll be wonderful. I thought about taking you back. I'm having her this weekend. No, not this weekend, Johnny, uh-- next. Don't you remember? Look, Frank, you want a drink? All right, if you don't want me. Go back to Evie. Oh, she'd give you such a welcome. Go now. Take her for a nice long walk. I'll take her around the block before I turn in. But that's just routine. Give her something special tonight, hm? A present. She loves you so much. I feel like getting pissed. You're not even taking her around the block? Don't always scoot me feet. I've got a mate. He wants to buy her. Johnny. Pestering me like mad, he is. 20 quid, he's offering. Johnny, promise me that you won't sell her to anyone except me. Hey, mate, put another one in here. Do you want-- want a drink, Frank? Promise! Yeah, that's funny. We never seem to talk about anything these days. Except Evie. That stock business turned out to be a right caper. I tried, Johnny. I keep telling you. I was banking on that. A litter or two of puppies would have sorted things out nice. Yes, I realize it's a disappointment, Johnny. As it is, I can't afford to pay for her. It's the truth. Well, you wouldn't have wanted her to have been forced to-- Well, that would be rape, really. No, she didn't fall in love with the champ. You sure? Well, it's just a matter of the money. I mean, if you really want to keep her-- Ah, this is where we came in. Buy her, Frank. I can't give you it all at once, but look-- look, I'll come by with the rest of it. [music playing] [thunder claps] [moans] Hm? [dog whimpering] Taxi! Taxi! Ta-Taxi. Victoria, please. - Sorry, excuse me. [dog barks] Evie! Evie! Evie. Come on, Evie. Here, in here. [dog barks] Sorry. Frightened. Terribly sorry. [dog whimpering] Oh, all right. [music playing] Evie! Evie! Come back! No! Back! [dog barks] Evie! Evie! Evie! [music playing] No, I'm sorry, sir. I can't take your dog. [inaudible] Evie, you've got to be a good girl. Good girl. Right? Do as you're told. Here. Here, what's this? What's this? Here you go, Evie. [intercom buzzes] VOICE ON INTERCOM: Mr. Meadows? Mr. Meadows? - I can't talk to anyone now. Sorry! [dog whining] [inaudible] I'll call you back. I-- Stop it! [phone rings] [dog barking] Hello? Frank Meadows. Yes. What? No. Come back here, Evie. Stay. Stay, stay. Stay! Sit. Come here. Not now. I-- I-- I can come back later. Yes, sir, [inaudible] for dinner. Sit! Sit. Sit. Evie. There you are. Why are you behaving like this? Why? Why? [dog barking] Sit. Here. Here. Here. Here. Good girl. Evie. Evie. Evie, what are we to do with you? What are we to do with you? Hey? Goodbye, sir. Thank you, Harry. Setting up office at home, is he, sir? No, not quite. Uh, we're letting him do some of his work at home, that's all. I see, sir. Come on, Harry, this isn't the War Office after all, is it? No, sir. Oh, hello, Mrs. Brown. I didn't do your flat, Mr. Meadows. Oh, oh she's not in the living room, you know. I got to the front door, the growl. Scared me. Not going in there at all. No chance. Oh well, we'll work something out. Hey? Evie. Frankie, darling! Yoo-hoo! Oh, God. [inaudible] [dog barking] [inaudible] She's been very badly treated. Sorry. Evie. Heh. Here. Evie! Good girl. Evie, I've got a lot to do, I've got to get on. I want you to be a good girl. A very good girl. I want to impress everyone. And I want them to know that my life goes on just as normal. So in you go. Good girl. Keep quiet, go to sleep. ANNOUNCER (ON TV): And as we would expect this early in the race, both crews are pulling fast as well. They're pretty well neck and neck. Oh, your big day has come back again, Frank. Yes. As a matter of fact, I think your do gets a bigger note on our calendar than the bloody boat race itself. Absolutely. It's just an excuse. I'll compare it to Christmas. Hello, Frank. Oh, yes. Yeah, it's damn cruel to keep an animal locked away all day in a room like that. I have a friend who runs kennels, and I can tell you, she'd be appalled. My dear darling cousin, Margaret. May I explain something to you? The reason why she's shut in at all is because she can't bear to share me with [inaudible]. Oh. Poor beast. [music playing] ANNOUNCER (ON TV): There they go. Cambridge is just beginning to pull away. They're just slightly past [inaudible] Really beginning to-- [cheering] [music playing] Frank. Margaret, no! [dog growls] Evie! [screaming] [glass breaks] ANNOUNCER (ON TV): What an excellent race they ran. And a delightful spring day. Beautifully judged and with a pace which Oxford never really matched. [music playing] [dog whining] JOHNNY: Hello, Frank. Johnny. [baby crying] I reckon you had the best of the bargain. Well-- [baby crying] [music playing]
