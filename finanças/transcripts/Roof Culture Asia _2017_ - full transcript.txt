Jis Well, training on roofs was something that we always kind of did. We just kind of enjoyed goin' on roofs, enjoyed movin' around on roofs explorin', and doin' that kind of stuff. It just made me think, "oh, this is... "This is what we do." Jis roof culture was just a five-minute YouTube video really, wasn't it, at the start? People responded to it really, really well, mainly because they had, like... People hadn't seen anything like that. And the whole, like, theme and feel of the video was like a context that parkour had never really been seen before. A renegade style of movement on rooftops that almost goes back to the original style or the original reason why parkour had kind of been created in the first place. It has always been happening, since, like, the founders training up high. It's always been a thing in the sport. Yeah. We knew it was gonna be a controversial project from the start, but, um, didn't realize how much it was gonna sort of cause a stir in the community and in the world outside of parkour as well. The launch of the clothing and the kind of "roof cult” branding created this very sort of anti-establishment vibe, and it was definitely what they were going for. And I mean, they do question everything, and they are sort of the... the rebels, and they were... They were the ones in the scene at the time doing something very different. Jis the ♪roofcult and the general parkour movement and the amount of sort of rooftop stuff going on has pushed this more and more into a cultural trend. Roof culture is all about taking the skills that you have developed and learned to the highest point that you can and testing yourself. But the hashtag was being taken away from where the guys intended it to be. There are people that are just going on roofs for Instagram, just to, like, shock people that have no experience with height. It would be arrogant to say that we're reclaiming it, but we wanna show that it's not about posing. Then the idea of, like, "maybe we should do "a roof culture too" emerged, but mainly as a joke. Just like, "wouldn't it be funny if we could do that again?" The way to step it up from what we did in the uk is bigger and better cities. There wasn't a decision process and like, "oh, should we do roof culture in like, "south America or Africa or like...?" Do you know what I mean? It was just Asia was the obvious choice. You have so many incredible cities and so much culture that is so different from what we normally experience. Jis it's just fucking tall buildings. It's huge, it's so intense there. It's the next challenge. We'd never really put ourselves up against any kind of mega-city before. It all kind of made sense, and before long, roof culture Asia was the target, and the guys were just heading towards it. Jis There was so much up in the air and so much that we were unsure of. Just too many variables to be able to predict what we were actually gonna be able to do. We didn't even know if we were gonna be able to shoot any parkour. We were just all joking around, just havin' fun until we actually land and realize, "shit, we gotta get this done. "We've gotta actually start makin' a film." What was your accommodation like? Oh, fuckin' hell. Chungking mansion. Where do I even begin? You never think about the worst possible situation, and then we kind of got in this lift and experienced it. We've actually had to share some miniature beds for the entirety of our two-week stay in Hong Kong. Like, potentially, I'll sleep in the hall. Now, that's not bad. Every time I think of chungking mansion now, it just makes me laugh. It's the shittest accommodation I have ever stayed in. There's the toilet. Within minutes, somebody had sat on a bed, and it had broken, so the bed was thrown out into the corridor, and a mattress was just layin' on the floor. Blocked toilets reeking of shit. Oh, no. We truly believed that they'd messed up our booking. How many people we have in one room. It's just like, "oh, shit, this is the start. "Like, this is day one." Home, boys. I fuckin' hate this place. My feet smell like dead warthog. So, after the sort of, the arrival and a bit of planning, we basically had to jump straight into scouting. First day was just get out, climb as many roofs as possible, and find the most amount of spots I possibly can. Um, the plan right now, first day, we're just gonna wander around kowloon and see if we can get up onto any of these buildings, just to get, like, the lay of the land and see what we're workin' with. We have two weeks in each city, so it was really this... This race against time to find enough rooftops that were gonna offer what we needed to make this film happen. Basically trying to sharpen the knife, finding the best locations for filming and the movement. Nice. We were constantly splitting off into these little groups to explore different areas of the city. You go out, you take photos and videos on your phone, and we had this whatsapp group and we're all putting everything in there at the end of the day. Doin' a little video and voicin' it over, and it... It proved to be incredibly effective, actually. When we came back to WiFi, everyone could log in and see the spots of the day. Whew, finally. Ah! Jis before, we thought we'd be taking rest days maybe every, like, three days, but it was so much harder to find buildings than we originally thought that we just totally scrapped that plan, and basically every day was wrecking, unless we had stuff to shoot. Jis before we check out, dude. Parkour free run, boom, boom, boom. Yeah, yeah. How do you say it? - Yeah, alright. - Yeah. Success. Sorry. Run! I couldn't even tell you the amount of roofs we went on the first few days out in Hong Kong, but it involved a lot of security, a lot of running away, a lot of alarms, and basically getting to grips with the authorities and the architecture that we were gonna be dealin' with for the next two weeks. Jis I can't even fathom how many times we're gonna do this - in this... - I know, yeah. We should keep a track. What? How many roofs we climb? How many roofs we. The first alarm we encountered... We'd had enough success throughout the day that we were feeling cocky. I mean there's a security camera looking at you, but... Like the loudest fucking alarm I have ever experienced in my life. Fuckin' hell. Shit. Kind of laughing, but kind of deaf in one ear as well. Fucking hell. And that was definitely the first bout of, like, "okay, we're gonna... "We're gonna be experiencing alarms. "We're gonna be experiencing security." Maybe turn left. About 50% of the time, the alarms went off, but 50% of the time is always worth a shot. It could not go off, and we could find out what's on this roof, or it could go off, and it will split your ears. That's how loud it is. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. Definitely. Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, go. We need to get in. There's no alarm, please. Is it worth lookin' at? Let's go then. It's just something we had to go through. Like, dealing with the alarms is part of your daily routine in the end. Sorry, sir. Just takin' some... some photos of the view. Oh, my god. Oh. Nice. Yeah! Yes! Fuck. Another alarm? Fuck yeah! - Yes. - Yes. - Woo. - Well done, Josh. Well, well. There's a guy down there next to our stuff. What the fuck is he doin'? Get down, get down. Yeah. =yeah. Do you think he was looking for us? Yeah. Where's he gone? Just right there. We haven't got away with it yet. Shit. 3, 2, 1. There is always that mindset from the general public that what we, and the parkour community, and storror do is reckless. But when you see the behind-the-scenes of it, it's so calculated. Every single variable is taken into sort of consideration, and a prime example of this was we're on this roof, and benj finds this run that's this cat pass pre to a beam that is 30 stories up with a sheer drop on either side. Cat pass fly while jump. - Oh, shit. - Yeah. Unless he wants to stay on that beam and stick it, he has to then jump to a wall, and then sort of climb out of... Out of the risk. I mean, he goes through everything. He checks every surface. He preps every bit to the level that he can. You don't always see something and say, "yep, I'll do that,” or "yep, I can do that. I'll do that now." Some things you have to work on and you have to prepare for, and this was that thing. The height, for me, isn't a factor. Like, I'm not gonna be doing something I can't do. Just need to... Zone into the cat pass, I think. As long as he's comfortable, I just have to trust his abilities. The trust is absolutely fundamental. They're accepting that I know my own ability. So, what they do from that point onwards is they just help encourage, they give me points on stuff that I'm not necessarily thinking about. So, the whole team is almost prepping the jump with me. I mean, I just got to stay calm on the cat pass, and then it's fine, I think. It's weird because the commitment level that I had going into this trip, I knew I wanted to push myself. If I start prepping and it doesn't feel right, I'll... 1 won't do it, but, as I was going through the stages, everything felt positive. That's when... That's when you commit. That's the point where you go, "okay, yeah, there's no reason I shouldn't be doing this." - Are you ready? - Yep. Okay, go. Oh, my god. - Hoo-hoo! - That's never fun to watch. That is never fun to watch. That's the cleanest I did it. That was sick, benj. You'll see the one I got, then. - Yeah. - Woo-hoo! - Yes! - The group morale after the first few days in Hong Kong was really good. We were finding some awesome locations and were starting to really get to grips with this new city that we'd all been so excited to come and train at. Jesus. Yeah. You gotta get both legs simultaneously. Agh! Oh, shit. Fuckin' hell. I've taken the wrong approach. Hang on. Everyone's taking different ways. Woo! That was romantic almost. We're not criminals. Job's a good'un. Me and benj went up this 30 to 40 stories high. And it was just three or four strides that were maybe six foot apart, but if you fell or messed up any step, then it was down to your death. I've done the same thing at like five stories before, but somehow, it's different when you're at 40 stories. It... it messes with your mind a lot more. There's almost more of a certainty to it. 'Kay, go on. Yes. Yeah, it's a shock. And those strides were a massive mental challenge. Like, you just have to get past it and just try and think, "there is no way that I'm gonna mess this up. "I could do this a thousand times at ground level, "and I would never mess it up. "So why would it be any different here?" What's through there? Compact sort of thing. So as we were getting into the swing of stuff in Hong Kong... It was me, Max, and sacha, and we got off at a stop called north point. We found a tall block of flats, and they're, like, separated into loads of different towers. I spotted a jump from one tower block to another. Kind of a fairly small gap, but it was fuckin' high up, like, maybe 25 stories or something. I ended up doing the jump absolutely fine. I remember doing it, like, three or four times on sacha's camera and asking him to film it on my phone in slow motion. Go for it. I posted it on my Instagram 'cause I thought it was a cool clip. We wake up the next morning, it's had 70,000 views on Instagram and already started getting some traction on blogs and things like this. I think it took two days to get up to its full height of virality. Crazy, crazy amounts of views on it. Within another day or so, it was on unilad, on the daily mail, like, it was getting picked up everywhere. I think it must have racked up over 10 million view in total. You cold feel the heat around Hong Kong the more and more exposure it got, the more million of views it got. It was like, "surely, people are aware of this." You would get people in the street like, "oh, you're this guy,” or "oh, you're storror..." Some guy on the train came up to Toby with Max's jump on his phone again and said, "do you think this is fake or real?" And Toby just goes, "ask him for yourself." I'm... I'm so glad and I'm so fortunate to meet you guys. Nice to meet you, man. Weird, fuckin' weird. He's got a video up on his phone, and it's me, but he doesn't believe it. - You? - Yeah, that's me. And so, most people in Hong Kong had seen the video, including all the police force, of course, because it's illegal. It was a hard one for us because north point had this great abundance of rooftop spots and locations but... The security and the police had sort of caught on to the fact that we were there. Because obviously it's their job, basically, to stop us doin' what we're doin'. So, we sort of had to up our game further. We still got quite a way to go. Maybe halfway or something. We'll go out there. Jis Job's a fucking good'un. Yes! We're gonna have to get down from here quick I think. - Yeah. - People in those escalators - are spotting us like... - Yeah, yeah. Fuck me. Yeah! Sick. Alright, police down there. They were there already, though, right? Gettin' your head round the heights, that early on and at that height was hard. I can actually get up. - Really? - Yeah. - Should I pass your bag? - Yeah, pass it. See those... See those pipes there? Oh, my god. Sacha, we've been spotted. Jis no way, whoa. Who's that? It's official... What? Cool, let's get the fuck down. Jis Quick, quick, quick. Fucking get out of there. Do you know what time it is? It's, uh, 4:30. Nice one. Thank you very much. Straight out the front door. That's how we do. That was ridiculous. Me and Toby just arrived back from this sick mission. She even showed me the video and I'm like, "wow, that's crazy." We met the other guys at the apple store where we were supposed to be meeting, and, um, they were having photos taken with them. What is this? Sure, yeah, no problem. Next, please. Seriously, I'm baffled. Oh, my god. And so we asked a few of them, like, "do you know who we are and what we do?" And they're like, "yeah, yeah, you do parkour, right? "You were on unilab." This is the strangest thing that's ever happened. It almost felt like everyone had seen the video. It was a strange experience. Like, if something happens in Hong Kong, it feels like everyone knows about it. Jis It's raining season in Asia, so that means it rains quite often. We were ready to shoot our first like, proper action sequence. Like, just got my bag packed, everything. Look out the window. It's raining. I think that's gonna happen more than once in this trip. So, after I post the clip online and it went viral, Max wanted to go back and use that jump in a run. We decided it would be a good idea to try and go back and try and film it with more angles because obviously, so many people had liked the jump. I'm sure at least one person in this, like, apartment block has seen the video. And if they have, they would tell security. And by then, north point was a hot area. Some people were gonna shoot it from the floor, some people were gonna shoot it from the roof. It's... it's startin' to spit. Everyone's in position, everyone's ready. If it rains right now, that's really fuckin' shit. Fuckin' rain. That's gonna fuck them up. Jis while we were seeing if the rain would pass, we caught the security guard looking through the bushes, so maybe they have seen the video and they're on it. We went away for half an hour and waited for it to dry up, dry up in half an hour? That's just fuckin' annoying. And we've got everyone set up and this has happened. Did they get inside? Oh, well, I don't know. They're... they're maybe in the lift right now like, thinking, like, "oh, we'll come up to dry weather.” You cannot sit here. - Yeah, we got it. - Okay. Thank you. It's now dried up, and we're gonna go for the second take. As we got to the lift, we were suddenly confronted by a huge number of security guards. We were just like, "sorry, we're just "visiting our friend." And they're like, "what's your friend's name?" And I was like, "uh... Scott." It, like, messed that up. It was very obvious that they'd seen the viral clip. Police. We get out of there as quickly as possible. That's a complete change from last time we went up so... They've definitely seen the video. They've seen the video. We're now also being followed by the security guard at the place. Yeah, he's still following. We do a good 3-2-1, I drop my bottle of water, do up my bag, and we would just start sprinting. So we ran off, and we've now lost him, I think. Gotta meet back up with the others. There was four of us waiting around the corner from the jump, while the other team were going there and filming it. At one stage, I glanced over and I thought I saw Ryan a couple hundred meters away, and I was like, "oh, maybe that's Ryan." So I ran over there and couldn't see him, but I looked left and saw this guy who was really looking at me, and then was aware that he was following me. And I sat down and I was like, “I think there's a policeman following me," and we kind of looked... And the police started walking towards us, and we thought, "no way could that be for us." Like, I guess we're all wearing black, but no way would they know that we're in any way connected to that jump. He started asking questions and started getting on the radio... "Have you been on roofs? What are you doing?" Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And we're all kind of denying it until the guy then pulls out his phone and scrolls down the stored Instagram feed... And saw a picture of Josh, so that he just walked up to Josh and said, "look." "This is you. Stop telling lies." To which, of course, Josh couldn't, like, deny it. It was just a photo of him on his phone. All of us were like, "oh, shit." There are just so aware of what we're doing. They just fully know. Jis we just got let go. Um, they have all of our details. They were literally pulling up numerous Instagram feeds. Um, they know where we're staying. Fuck! - They know where we're stayin'? - Fuckin' hell, it's so shit. The store is uh, going on a roof, shooting for a few hours, editing photos, and putting them online straight away, and it's a trail of where we have been and where we might go again. The policeman got out his phone and then was scrolling down a news article with just Max. What? So, what now, like, the next week is gonna be so hard to film anything. The police literally were following us on social media, like, they were so aware of our presence. They know who we are, what we're doing, all of our names... Uploading this kind of stuff to social media while we're still in Hong Kong was a really bad idea. We decided that night that the best thing to do would be just to black out all our social media, just totally go underground until we finish all the filming in Hong Kong, and then we can bring it all back up again. They knew we were like, professional free runners, and like, we're here to make a film and stuff. Jis but perhaps the biggest agent of change is your cell phone. After all, a picture speaks a thousand words, but one viral video can mean the difference between action an non-action. So many police. - So many police. - So now we're put in the weird position of, like, we have five days left. We have to shoot a shitload more, and we have to carry on. We have to go on. What the fuck? Jis everything is against you, everything. The time, security, the weather, the access to the building, everything is against you. There's nothing that goes your way, and to be able to get through all of those obstacles and then find the line, find something that you're happy with, is so fucking hard... I can't explain. It's the hardest project I've ever, ever been involved in. Hmm. Yeah. Jis yo! Ooh! It's a fun challenge sometimes, and there's a lot of problem solving that goes into it. That's how you get past a coded door, ladies and gentlemen. You get Ryan lovejoy with a broomstick. Jis You have to jump at the bottom, let's do this. Jis The last three, four days of Hong Kong was intense. Like, we had a lot of filming to do, and we had a lot of ground to make up from all the previous wrecking. One of the first spots we actually found was on top of our accommodation. We kind of noticed that there was a gap there, like between these two roofs, and it did look like, worryingly possible. It's big. It's 17 stories high, it's 16 foot across. Callum came up and looked at it and was like, "actually, I think I can do that." I look at this jump and I'm thinking, "surely not, Callum. "You know that, right? You can't make that.” If I work the run-up out and eliminate any variables and things that can go wrong, then I know it's something that would be possible. Tomorrow, we'll have a meeting, right? Work it all out, and then I think we start here. So, first thing in the morning, we said to Callum, like, "you ready, you wanna do this jump?" And he was up for it. We all went up there, got the drone, got all the cameras... Jis So Callum's about to do this jump here. Taking off here, running along here, and doing this gap. Man, if he does it, that'd be one of the fuckin" craziest things I've ever seen in my life. Josh is gettin' his angle. This is gonna be fucked, man. And just like that, it'd be the nastiest thing anyone's ever done. He's gone fuckin' absolutely mental. The death drop this side, which is kind of daunting, so you just gotta block everything out. With Callum, he is such a prestigious and professional athlete that I do have a huge amount of confidence in him. How you feelin'? Uh, pretty good about it, I just need to... To be sure about the run-up and the take off. As soon as I'm on that wall, it's some good speed. Yeah. Callum is a monster at moving. Everything he does is drilled and drilled and drilled, and you know he's put in more training than anyone, and it shows. Everything in my body is screaming "no", but I know that he is a confident guy, and his skill set is at a level where he can accomplish that sort of movement at that height. The jump measures out at 16, but when I look at it like this, it looks fucking massive, and I think it's just 'cause of that drop down there. Every jump someone's gonna do, no matter what the risk, really, or anything like that, when you can tell they're in that mental preparation state, you let them be. The closer he's getting to actually going for it the first time, the scarder I got. All good? He starts gettin' more and more ready for the jump, and as soon as he's about to go, security come out. By the time I decided, like, it's happening now, then there was no way that were were gonna let the security stop us. - This way. - Why? Yeah, go for it, Callum. Okay, 3, 2, 1. Jis Yes. My boy, Callum! Woo-hoo! And everyone was pumped, everyone was really happy at the fact that he'd just conquered this ridiculous gap. That is maybe one of the craziest things I've ever seen in my life. Fucking hell. That was so mental. I can't really convey how epic it was in words, to be honest. It just doesn't really do it justice at all. The security guard's going mad, and we're like, "okay, okay, we'll leave, we'll leave,” but then... Callum's like, "gotta do it again. "Not happy with the landing.” so he gets back into position... Which angle you filming from? Clear this way, clear this way. Okay, yeah. Benj and drew, I think, are like trying to talk to the guy to calm him down, but he's really, really not happy about it. - Tell me when you're going. - Yeah, okay, yeah, I will. Running now. Jis yeah! Yeah, we'll get down, we'll get down. Go straight into our apartment, we all hide in one room. Just congratulating Callum, watching the footage. Yeah! No! Yeah! Sorry, mate. Sorry, mate. I basically made sure Callum was safe and then got the fuck out of there. And I went across the road and I sat at Starbucks, and the whole situation had got so stressful so quickly with the security and the aggression, I... 1 didn't know whether or not I could do five more weeks of this, and it fully kind of shit me up. It... yeah, it was bizarre, and while this was going on, I was getting these whatsapp messages going, "police are outside the room." Hide the sd cards. So, so we're all in here because the policeman called, and they're lookin' for us in this tower block. And the guys are basically communicating through whatsapp because the police are on the other side of their door knocking away... And the moment we heard them knock on the door next door to ours and move on from our door... We just thought, "yeah, now's the time. "We have to get out of this." Jis and it was a... yeah, a very, very stressful day, but then, you, you... I got back in the evening, and there's... There is that constant drive to just push through it, and the general group mentality is always very, very driven. And if there is something that they can question, they will question it. And if it stands in their way of them being creative, or breaking a jump, or doing something that is gonna kind of push them to a new level, that is what they would do, and that's what they do best. It is why storror are as successful as they are, because they don't let a challenge get the better of them. Jis Jis I could have stayed in Hong Kong longer, but at the same time, I feel like we had completed it. Hi. We were fully into the swing of stuff and ready to, like, get to the next destination and get our teeth sunk into, like, the next city. 30-meter gap. Don't tell Tokyo we're comin'. Fuck. This way, please. It's not recording. So we a... we arrive in Tokyo, and we get on this train, and... and fuckin' hell, it took a long time. When we finally get to our area... We'd done like a total of like, 12 hours traveling or something, so all of us were pretty sick of having our big, heavy bags and just wanting to like, sort of get changed, have a shower, and go to sleep. And we eventually find what we think is our building, but we weren't certain at this stage. We had to look for this black box with a key in it. You just have to find a key to get into your room, that's it. What time is it, 2 am? - 2:30. - 2:30. We're in Tokyo fucking lost as shit, I have no idea where we're sleeping tonight, and I'm really tired. The address we've got isn't... Doesn't mean anything, so we're fucking stuck and lost in Tokyo. And a policeman walks up on his bike, and we're like, "oh, is this just your friendly "neighborhood sort of Bobby comin' along to help us out?" And it's... it's not. There's been a legitimate noise complaint from someone complaining about us just... Being on the street and talking. Where are we sleeping tonight? And then, there's another noise complaint comes through, and this phone gets passed over to Toby. Are we under arrest? Okay, all good. Alright, no problem. Didn't realize that. Yeah, street. I ended up on the phone with some police chief woman who said there'd been two noise complaints. And we actually haven't been making any noise at all, surprisingly enough. We can't find our way to this building. Woman won't reply, so how we gotta go find a roof to sleep on. Woo-hoo! I love Tokyo so far. That already was like, "oh, okay, like, "that's... is that just this area? Are we in a posh area?" Like, it felt relatively nice, or is that just Tokyo? Is that what we're about to have to encounter? Alright, where we goin' how? Got to about 3 in the morning, still couldn't find this "black box" where the key was meant to be. I went into a shop, familymart, across the road, got myself a nice little fizzy pineapple juice. Turned out to be 10% alcohol, got a bit smashed, um, and then we ended up sleeping on a roof that night. Got in the lift to the top of the roof out of a fire exit and all just laid on our bags and fell asleep, straight up. Woke up the next day swelteringly hot. And we didn't get into our apartment until the afternoon of the next day. This is our Japanese apartment. Classic slider doors we got goin' on. We got four in this room. More classic sliding doors, see that, Callum? Couch sofa. The culture in Japan is so, so different from what we're used to at home and what we're used to in Hong Kong. To, like, the uk and Europe, it is literally polar opposite. It's like Las Vegas, but for nerds. Kind of freaked out by, like, their mannerisms. Like, they're all bowing at me and, like, they... They wanna make themselves really small, and I don't really understand it. Jis then you get the... The whole anime thing, which is massive out there. And it is just the most bizarre place I've been, I think. It's always nice to go somewhere that you haven't been before and experience a different country after two weeks in the same place. So the first couple of days was sort of, again getting to grip with the... Of the area of the country, goin' to familymart and gettin' some different food for a change. You know, it's just like, fun, I guess. You alright, love? =lt looks like vomit. Everything is fish-flavored. That's all I've got to say. I'd like to think that there is no risk. I'd like to think we get to a point where we're relying solely on our skill and relying on a certainty that we are going to make it, and there is gonna be no other variable other than success. Jis our time in Hong Kong definitely showed us how important ground training is, because you need... You need to know yourself at ground level before you take anything up high. You're never gonna look at a roof gap that is higher than a story and go, "there's a chance I might not make that," because if there is a chance, then that chance exists, and then you could die. Like, it's... It's as simple as that. Jis right now, we're just having a little training session at our undercover spot 'cause it just hacked it down with rain. Just kind of, sort of ko'd our day in terms of actually being able to train anywhere decent. This place is pretty cool, though, so, yeah. Just havin' a little session with the locals, really. We'd already prepared to meet up with some locals, takuya and Masaru and a few others, just to utilize some of Tokyo's incredible spots and to just have a break from training at height. Jis hey! Nice, man. Nice. All these big jumps at height would not exist without the ten years' experience at ground level. What a lot of people don't really understand when they see people doin' parkour is that they just see these guys in this "extreme case" runnin' and jumpin' from buildings, blah, blah, blah. Yes. But people don't realize the amount of effort that's gone into being able to do these kind of amazing feats. You think about any other, like, athletic sport or discipline, you see all these athletes trainin' behind the scenes, and, almost, our ground training is that, if you know what I mean. It's that buildup to then doin' the stuff at height. Whoa! Triple back down. It looks so scary, I can't take it. Yes! It's always nice to go to a new city and see what people have done, and takuya's like, "oh, so-and-so's tried this." You know, "oh, that's really cool." And then, you try some of your own stuff, and it's basically like a parkour tour. It was a big relief to actually train at some ground spots after Hong Kong where everything was like, 40 stories high. Jis it's so, like, "ah, I've gotta do it now." Yeah. Woo! Jis Guess who started film too late? - Me! - You, bro. Callum, Callum, Callum! Quick, it's good, quick. - Yeah! - Oh! Okay. Oh, that was... Ha-ha! Sorry, guys. No filming. Okay, sorry. Stop, stop it. Ninja warrior! We get less trouble on the roof. Jis see ya later. That's pretty difficult. Ah, fuck! The audience is becoming quite amusing. You have to look over there. Go on, giles! Pressure, pressure. Oh! In order to do this kind of stuff, in order to, like, develop your skills to that level, you have to have discipline, and that's what this section of the film is all about, is... is showing that you can't just do difficult stuff without having preparation, without years of discipline and training in order to develop your physical skills to the level where you can perform on that stage of life or death. Any free runner and traceur starts from the ground up. It is not all about high rooftop stuff, like... Pushing yourself at ground level is... Is the absolute most important part of parkour. Oh, my god. It could actually happen. Oh, my lord. What the fuck? That's sort of the beauty in ground training is that you can really find out what your body is physically capable of, and not really have to worry about pushing through those mental barriers that you have to have at height. Jis Yes! Yeah! The amount of tries it took me, I'd never commit to on a rooftop because, you know, you mess up once up there, and you aren't training ever again. You mess up ten times on ground level, and you can mess up fen times more. It doesn't matter. Jis that was fucked up! You're invading my privacy. Jis See ya later, Max. Jis At ground level, there's the opportunity for the guys to push themselves a lot harder and test themselves. Um, training on rooftops is not about testing your limits. It's about proving your capability, and it's kind of like a celebration of all the hours spent training on ground and your accomplishments and the things that you already can do. It's very important if you're watching this and feel like you should be pushing yourself at crazy heights before you're ready because eventually people will hurt themselves, and it's not something we would encourage at all. So when you get down to the ground training, that's... that's where you really push these limits, and you progress physically. Something that might feel, like, impossible from the start, like, you're terrified of it, but if you keep working towards it, like, gettin' rid of these mental barriers, through, like, just preparation, then this is just feeling... I'm feeling better about this already. It's really feeling possible. Jis oh! That was beautiful. One-punch man? One-punch man! Jis Uh, the spots in Tokyo were great. I really wanna go back there at some point 'cause we didn't actually go to, like, some of the best ones. I was like, almost like a kid in a candy store waitin' to go on these rooftops, which we hadn't really explored properly yet. So, I was really, like... I was enjoying it, but I was really like, "ll wanna go on the rooftops "and see what they're like. I wanna see what "Tokyo has to offer, in that sense.” So, obviously, after two weeks of solid practice in Hong Kong, we'd realized that scouting was ridiculously important. So on our first proper day of scouting, we leave our apartment, and while Josh is waiting, he's... he starts swinging around this pole. Um, just swinging around it and landing back on the step. And the pole literally came out from the floor and went towards the ground. I literally managed to just catch it before it hit the ground. And we were like, "oh, shit, Josh, you broke a post!” And we laid it out on the floor and continued down the road. Very quiet area, no one's about, but we're walkin' down the road, and within a minute... Crazy, this police car comes up, little "woo!" Siren on, lights flash. The guys had just crossed the road when the green man wasn't on, and I thought it might be for jaywalking, but then... No way. No way! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look. He's describing it. Yeah, he's describing it. But how would he be...? Yeah, it is. Not ideal. Josh was swingin' around on some post, and it snapped off 'cause it was rusty at the bottom. And someone called the police instantly. - England! - England, yeah. They were like, "oh, were you drinking?" They wanted to know why we were here, what we were doing. Uh, the police numbers have doubled maybe? Look at this. Oh, sorry. And then I had to kinda, like, you know, really be apologetic, didn't mean to. Oh, I mean, yeah. He didn't do anything wrong. It's fucking crazy how, like, one person called the police, and now there's like... This is gonna be the biggest challenge in Tokyo, for sure, just like, trying to evade the police. They don't take their shit lightly. They weren't angry about the pole. They understood eventually that it was a mistake. They could see that it was rusty. But the police have to play by the book out there. We were thinking at this point, if it's like this right now, then what's it gonna be like for the rest of the trip? How long will you stay in Japan? - Two weeks. Yeah. - Two weeks? We're gonna be on so many rooftops you wouldn't believe, and from that moment on, we knew we were gonna be in trouble. A rainy, wrecky day in Tokyo. I'm up here with drew gettin' some photos. And, uh, yeah. Every single roof is so, so different, so it should be quite interesting to, uh, start tryin' to find actual parkour lines. I mean... It looks like there's fucking loads. Jis first day scouting in Tokyo. Me and Max climbing this little tower thing over here. Oh! There's drew and Toby over there. Sick. Just spotted the guys. Jis we might've just been hustled. Not good. Like, we... We've just started scouting in Tokyo. First roof we've come on, police car stops outside down there, but we don't think it was for us. But now, there's two police cars driving up and down the road outside our building. The siren's on. But, I don't think they're for us. Or the don't know how to get to us. - Either way, we should go. - Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go! - Let's go, let's go. Jis Job's a good'un. Too late, boys. After the first day of scouting in Tokyo, we were... Pretty apprehensive as to what we were actually gonna be able to shoot. The architecture was so erratic, there was no pattern to the city at all. The fuck? I don't have a clue where it's goin'. It looks kinda, like, similar in all directions. What about this white one here? Yeah? Maybe. You can look down a street, and every single building is different. And so the roof will be totally different on this one to the next. So that makes it really difficult because you can't judge how good a roof it's gonna be from the bottom. You'll be like, "oh, that looks so good." It's a lot lower of a level and not as high. You look at it from the ground and be like, "well, it looks really good, I wanna go on that." There's a lot of eyes on us, so try not to look too... Mental. Yeah, across there's loads of people in the stairway in that building. So my immediate impressions after the first couple of scouts were like, "shit, this is... This is a mess." Almost every single building is different. You get these high-rise buildings next to three-story buildings. And then every single one is just cluttered with steel beams, pipes, and air conditioning units. No, we've been on, like, three or four now, and every building seems to be really cluttered. Like, there's no open space. There's no room for run-up or, like, movement. But, um, maybe we just need to get used to it or find something different. Jis 90% of the stuff is unsafe, so you can't use it, and it's really, really frustrating and really hard to scout a line through all of that unsafe clutter. You could get up so many more buildings a day, but, so many more buildings a day were just awful. If anything, we'd have to change up our approach and style completely. Scouting is tough as it is in a good environment, but Tokyo was something else. Like, it was just days and days of failure, essentially. Get up at 8 every day, split up, go walk around for fuckin' hours, walk up hundreds of flights of stairs, and basically find nothing. This is the most fucked I've been in all of my training, training career. My eyes are blurry with sweat. That was when the kind of morale started to drop, and the motivation started to dwindle 'cause it did just start to feel like a job. We knew what style of movement we wanted to find on these buildings, and it just... initially, it wasn't coming together. We've heard from other traceurs that rooftopping in Tokyo was hard and you would spend time in jail if you get caught. So, we already knew that was a thing before we had even left for the whole trip. Scrub that brush out. You know, that's actually made quite a lot of difference right there. They've got no chill. Shit. Maybe it is us because we are up on these apartments that we didn't even notice. Watch it, watch it. Fuck, man. Yeah, they're coming back around. Oh, shit, boys. There was a main group who got in the lift, and then me and Toby had to go down the stairs 'cause there wasn't enough room in the lift. Look, they're just there. The police are just there. So if we go downstairs... Toby then takes the gopro, and I just went, "fuck it, I'm just gonna go "across this way and go down." I promise you. Just hold it. They know that we're on this roof. Yeah. Wait, wait, hold on right there. 'Cause if they drive past. Nah, nah, keep going. Keep going. Fuckin' hell. There's two police cars outside the front. Literally gettin' ready to sprint just like this. Fuckin' here we go. By the skin of our teeth. They were... They were outside the front, and we walked out the front. And they saw us and everything. I looked behind and there was two with their lights on. They just didn't follow us. What do you reckon? Josh and Toby got caught. Yes or no? Yeah. Like, we were very jammy to get away from that, I think. Yeah, I'm in a familymart right now, and the police are literally coming past every maybe 30 seconds, I don't know. - Fuck. - I'm like, up, coming up the other way to where you went. We're probably gonna get further away 'cause that sounds fuckin' sketchy. Do you know where Josh is or did you guys split up? Oh, Josh might be caught. I just spoke to the others just now. They somehow escaped by just walking past them. I honestly have no idea. Police on bikes goin' past every 30 seconds or something from "round the back. Tryin' to find you and you're just chillin' - in familymart. - Where the fuck have they gone? We just literally walked out the front door. Josh might be caught though. He's not been on WiFi yet, so he could well be caught. And I hear, like, five or six police officers go past, and I'm like, "shit, that must mean they must be gone." So I turn vault this wall and drop down, bam, and then walk out of this little car park. And I see this police car on the left and then two police officers there. I'm, like, just trying to casually walk away, and then... One of them just grabs me on the shoulder, and I was just like... I just got put against the wall, and then I'm literally surrounded by so many police officers, and I'm just like, "oh, god," like, tryin' to get my point across, but obviously, there's a language barrier, so I still had to get taken back to the police station. They were just like, mockin' me 'cause I was english, like, laughin' at me. And then they said, "we have to take you back to your house "and get your passport.” So I was like, "okay, go on, then." And then I had to write an apology letter, which was quite weird. And then they let me go. When we got stuck into it in the first few days, we noticed that everybody kind of plays for the same team in Japan. So it's like, if a Japanese person sees us on another Japanese person's roof, they'll, like, wanna call the police and stop it happening because they look after their neighbor, um, but just not when you're trying to film roof culture. As soon as we, um, leave tamagotchi station... What was it, actually? Tam... tamachi or something. As soon as we left tamachi station... Tamachi? As soon as we left this train station, we find this roof. So we just, like, casually walk up, and we're up there for 15 minutes trying to get runs, and suddenly... Should we get down or stay here? I don't know, I feel like there's no point in splittin' up from the others. Yeah, let's go. Josh, like, shouts over, and he's like, "police, police are here. Police." And then Callum starts saying like, "oh, there's police here as well, police here." So I carry on goin' down the stairs, jump across to another roof, and then notice that there's, like, maybe 10, 15 police on this roof. All with that batons out, all shouting. We're just like, "whoa, "we have not experienced this before." And then, like, ten police come and swarm me, and this, like, one translator guy. They eventually grab us all one by one. They've got Josh by the arm, and we all meet up at the bottom. We're all just looking at each other like, "what the hell is going on?" Like, this is such an overreaction. I was on the phone talking to a translator. He's basically saying we need to go back to the police station, and Callum"s saying, "can't we just "give 'em our details, and that's fine?" Jis Fucking hell. Like, Josh said, "oh, there's police here.” And then they appeared from literally everywhere, searched all our stuff, took everything out, like, interviewed us all separately. Then we had to drive back to get our passports to the thing, check all our details like blood type, hair color, shoe size, height, everything. If they thought we were taking photos, we would have been fucked. So they don't need to lock? Everyone obeys the law. Everyone plays on the same team. - Yeah, exactly. - Like, they really do. Me, drew, sacha, and Josh were all pretty shook up by the whole scenario. If it's that serious here, if it's that tight, it's that illegal, then, what are the chances of us carrying on, like...? We were pretty certain that we weren't gonna do anymore roof stuff that day because we thought that would just be straight up stupid. But then later on in the afternoon, we decided that there is no difference between being caught today or being caught tomorrow. We have to make this film happen. We've got a job to do. We're here to do this. If it means being arrested again or a few more times, then fine, like, it's gotta be done. Jis Jis Jis When I'm about to take off for a jump, I'm completely calm. Nothing matters, nothing changes midair. You have this one job, and you execute it. - There you go. - That was good. 'Course there's risks, right? Yeah, that's... that's obvious. But we're not taking that leap of faith that everyone thinks that it is. It's so calculated, you break everything down into chunks. This is actually sort of the takeoff. Seems solid. And now benj is just over there testing the landing, and that's good, I reckon. Give it a go. And how 'bout the flat bench? First jump of the day. That's the one. =nice. All I have in this whole entire world is this one job, and it's to do this move. And there's nothing else. There really... It's so cliché to say, but there really is nothing else. Jis Towards the end of Tokyo, when we're wrappin' up all our footage, I was like, "two weeks here, I'm good to move on, "and I'm lookin' forward to Seoul "and the last phase, phase three, of the trip." I was so happy to be leaving Tokyo. I think, if we had another week in Tokyo, I think I would have pulled my hair out of stress. Even though I loved Japan, and I loved Tokyo as a city, um, shooting the film, it was very challenging with the authority. Getting on that plane and heading over to Seoul was a huge kind of sigh of relief. Fresh slate of just like, "this is now my experience of Seoul. "What's it gonna be like?" Just speak. Microphone check, 1, 2, who is this? Perfect, okay. Give me a clap in front of your face. 3, 2, 1. Yeah. It's like doin' a fuckin' episode of "giles compiles”. Fuck, fuck, fuck. I find pissing in a bottle so hard. Ooh! Now I'm gonna glisten. Oppan gangnam style. I say "fuck" too much. What we tried to really do in Seoul is to kind of really switch it up. Hey there. Gay! Fuck. Jis I didn't really know what to expect when I came to Seoul at all. Um, I mean giles told me a pack of lies. He told me that the train windows frosted up when they went past skyscrapers and that there's flying cars and shit like that, and obviously, I believed that. Really nestled in the mountains, isn't it? Yeah, it's really... It's really nestled in the mountains. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Yeah! Within the first few days, I kind of established that the people of Seoul are very nice. Thank you. People were stopping and asking us questions in the street and laughing. It seemed like, quite like a friendly vibe. Ooh! Toby said it would be 100% rain in half an hour. I'd just like to say a huge shout out to 7-Eleven because without 7-Eleven, this trip would be impossible. Where are you from? - England. Do you like the song? Yeah, you like the song? Yeah, I like the song. So I think... wait, was this the first day scouting? We, uh... me, Max, and drew... On the tube, right. "Okay, we'll go to gangnam.” Like, that's a popular place in Seoul. Um... turned up, walked two minutes down the road, and boom! There's this jump. I can remember us looking at it for the first time. The gap goes all the way down to the floor, and it's just that visible feat between that building and that building. Jis so we had to go in this, like, clothing store, through the changing rooms to this fire exit, walk up a few sets, get out the lift to the top story and then out into their smoking area, climb up a ladder and get on top of the roof to see what the takeoff was like. And it was perfect. The only problem with this gap was how slippery the run-up was. The takeoff was like shiny metal. You put your foot on the ground, it would slip like that. So I was, like, thinkin' about that over and over again, just, like, me slipping, me falling and not falling a story, but now I'm falling 20 stories. So we tried spitting on our shoes and taking off all the dust. Still slippery. So that was, like, the main issue. I just kept on thinking, "I can't do this jump "without a better takeoff." What we decided to do was something we actually have never done before. - Oh, yeah, that's perfect. - Two piece, three piece? Two, maybe three. - How sticky? - Is it sticky? - Okay. - Like, chh, sticky? - Okay. - Basically, I'm gonna do a really big roof jump, and the takeoff's really slippery, so we need tape that's really grippy. Is that alright? 3,000 won. 10,000 won. Gotta do it now. Let's go. The guys got WiFi and, um, pretty much summoned the whole team to come and film this gap. At one stage, we were on different sides of the city, and we got this whatsapp message saying, like, "get here now, we found this jump. "Like, the guys wanna get it done today." It's just been, like, sitting in that Starbucks waiting for the others with the drone, and, um, yeah, for 700, just stewing with nerves, just... that's what it is. I'm the sort of person, that I'm like a get-up-and-go and just wanna do it straight away. And just waiting is the worst. We went and got the drone back from the apartment, and we trekked over there, and we all knew our roles. Well, I guess I'm gettin' the shot from here. I can see them at the top, and I don't know if I'm gonna get kicked off here. So the situation is, I'm currently trying not to point this up at the sky 'cause we're on a relatively populated road. Max is standing on the edge of this building ready to jump. Keeps doin' preps. Yeah, okay, drone"s up. That is loud. - He's still prepping. - For fuck's sake. Slow. Yeah. Jump, for fuck's sake. Look how many fuckin' just saw him straight away. Here we go. Nope. Come the fuck on. This is so tense. Throughout the whole prepping process, people were coming out for cigarettes on the top of the roof. See, people come out and have cigarettes, and, like, we have a window of like ten minutes to do the jump before the next person comes out and has a cigarette. So before the next comes, I reckon I'm gonna go for it. Clear. With these guys, when they're pushing themselves to their absolute kind of mental limits at height, it's... it's... I trust them. I really, really do. There's been no moment on this trip where I've genuinely been like, "oh, he's gonna die, he's gonna die." Like, you're aware of the risks, but you have to just think, "okay, he's comfortable, he's prepared. "He's... he's gonna give this everything that he has, "and I'm very confident it's gonna go fine." Oh, no! Come on, Max. He's runnin'! Jesus Christ, that was beautiful. Easy. - He did it so easily. - That was so beautiful. Holy shit. Going first with an unknown jump is always the hardest, and just, I have a mad amount of respect for what he did then. You've got it. So, did you see, like, I slightly stuttered on the run-up, and it was still fine. Obviously, put effort into it, but once you're in midair, you'll feel it. The landing's fine. Just go for it, you got it. Callum, when do you wanna go? Uh, like, I'm up for right now, yeah. Alright, okay. I'll go after you, then. Going second is so much better than going first. Definitely. It's almost like the first person unlocks it, and then it's so much easier to go for. The decision is made as soon as you think, "yes, this is possible.” Before you commit to run-up and you're gonna go for it, it is like you've already done it. Fuckin' hell. Ah! Yeah! Woo! Physical challenges and technical challenges, they're all well and good like, you go home feeling great, but the thing that fills me with the most joy and happiness is, um, overcoming mental barriers, overcoming fear. Sick. That's a wrap! We... get out of here. Fuck yeah! Callum doing it, I was like "yes!" And then benj doing it, and absolutely fine, it was just like... That was the best feeling. Like, I can't explain how happy I was at that point. I found that that day, and four hours later, it had been filmed and was in the bag. I'm doin' a fat roof jump. Oh, someone's too heavy. That single moment, running down the stairs, and then out to the building and then all meeting up, that's... that's the feeling of roof culture. That feeling of group accomplishment. We... we conquered this thing all together, and we captured it. - Sick. - Felt fucking nice. That's what we came out here to do, in my head. I was so happy for you two when you did it. I was like, "fucking yes!" That jump sums up roof culture as a project. Everything came together. That is fucked. For the rest of the day, I just had a straight up smile on my face. It's just... I can even... I'm smiling now just thinking about how good that felt. - Oh! - Yeah, buddy! We're accomplishing stuff that we're gonna remember for the rest of our life. I'll never forget that roof gap. Like, I will never forget it. Jis Talk me through your morning routine, Toby. Go and buy coffee. What are you doing? Sacha, you may have to put your shoe on properly. - Done. - Done. So the first couple of days, I reckon, Seoul... The rooftops were better than Tokyo, so it's a thumbs up. We accustomed to the consistent training quite quickly. The more exhausting part was just scouting. Scouting every day, walking up so many stairs. If a lift needed a key card, if there were security at the bottom floor, we'd be walking 30 stories of stairs, come to a locked door and have to walk it all the way back down. Jis yep, locked. Just walked up 20 floors. Fuckin' shit! That's gotta be an alarm. - It has to. - That isn't enough. Oh, that's a key card. - Fuck. - You need key access. How many floors have we just done? 25. Stairs, stairs, more fuckin' stairs. Fuck. Jis Fuckin' hell. Come on, there's gotta be some fuckin' roofs. Look how many roofs there are! It's just so hard to fuckin' find them. You just have to keep doin' it 'cause you know there's that small possibility that there could be something amazing out there. Very good. Big, massive team run, I reckon. There's gaps there as well, look. Like, not high gaps, but fun gaps. Yeah. It's always that, "oh, try one more. "We'll go to that extra building over there. "Justin case.” And that extra 10% has made so much difference in this project. We couldn't have done it any other way. What are your thoughts on this? Uh... I've already had one shower this morning. Watch that baby grow! Fu...! Ah, butchered that. Yeah! Oh, oh. Fuck you. I'm just stuck in the 70s I can't get out. I just got 58 three times in a row. That's good, mate. Oh, ah. Oh, ah. Oh, ah! New high score. Have you met the green alien when you get past 1000? Yeah, I've shagged it. Hello? Hello? I mean, when you've been wrecking all day, and it's fucking boring, he's gotta spice it up again. It gets to your head, it does. We've all gone a bit loopy from the sun. Loopy. Out there, you get any one you want back. Wahh! Shit! Wahh! That was a fuckin' big butterfly. Jis you get up onto these roofs, and if there are security, you might initially have that kind of "hey, what are you doing, what are you doing?" But like, we've had he odd occurrence where, like, we've been mid-filming of a line and you say, "five minutes, five minutes.” Whatever you say to them, and the absolute majority of the time, they step back and they watch. Security. Ready? Jis yeah! Woo! Oh! Woo! Sorry. Okay, no more, no more. - Sorry about that. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, sir, sorry. Sorry for the hassle. Nice to meet you. Woo-hoo! Well done, benj. Celebratory peach. Jis Some worker is taking us to the roof after tryin' to kick us off. Benj, we've gotta go down. - Age. - 22. 22. 24. Thank you, brother. Fuckin' hell, this cat pass better be worth it. Jis tape, tape, tape, every day tape. Yes, you climb out of there? That is... that is problem. - I'm so sorry. - Okay. No, no we're sorry. All we wanna do is get, like, one clip. If you give us, like, five minutes, we'll go. I have to call the cop. Oh, okay. Yeah, let's go. I don't think it's possible. I thought we had it. You have something that you wanna film, and you have something that you really wanna do, you go up there, you get ready to film, and then, suddenly a security guard comes out and your whole line is cut. Oh, he's hit my score. You're one here, right? Poor Ryan. Take it easy, guys, take it easy. 90. Fuckin' hell, here comes the high score! Here comes the jump in. Here comes the jump. =-chill, cill, chill. Chill. =chill. Fuck. - Chill, bro, chill. - Big moment, this is the biggest moment in roof culture history. Fuck, fuck, fuck. What's his record? 115. More adrenaline than any roof gap. Wait, wait, wait wait, wait, wait! Let it chill, let it chill. - Oh, shit. - What's going on? Oh, that was a risky tap. Fuck me. Oh, he's good. Chungking. Oh! What the fuck! Was that your last...? Yeah, that was my last high score. So obviously, in the last roof culture I did a 360 dive roll over a rail roof gap, which was pretty fun. Woo-hoo! And so, I've kind of made it my mission for this whole trip to find one. What's the situation? Drew's just struggling to get steps. But obviously, because of, like, me being ill at the start and then me having the heel injury, I hadn't really had the opportunity to break any, like, big, big mental barriers at any point on the trip. And so, I started prepping for this dive roll, and was like, "okay, I'll just do the dive roll first, "do that a few times, get confident with it, "and then I can do the 360." I kind of underestimated how hard it was to break that first mental barrier of like, diving over this gap up over a wall, like, the first time, not having done it before. 3, 2, 1. 3, 2, 1. He sounds very confident. He said he could just feel himself wanting to spin, so. If he wants to spin, he should spin. And so, once I'd broken the mental barrier, and like, beaten the voices in my head of doing the dive run going over the gap, really, the challenge sort of changed, and it was away from, like, the difficulty in the move, and now, it was like, kind of the time spent in the sun. Do I look worried? What's the matter? I'm fucking boiling. This place is horrible. It's so hot. My head is pounding. I was up on the roof filming with like, my t-shirt over my head, and you're in like, pools of sweat. Whether you're an athlete or a filmmaker, or in sacha's case, both, heat is definitely one of the most difficult things to cope with out here. I'm gonna try and cool down. Dehydration, low blood sugar levels. Never good for when you're trying a dangerous move. Like, your ears are constantly popped. Yeah. And people think you guys are reckless. Takin' five minutes out. Take five minute to cool down. Make sure I don't hurt myself. Absolutely knackered. I'm so hot. And what are you tryin' to do? Side flip a roof gap run. 360 dive roll a roof gap. Run, dive over the barbed wire, like a vault roll. All in the blistering heat. All in the devil's heat. Should we do it? Ah! Drew just said this is gonna be fuckin' hard. Alright. - Ready? - Yep. Jis Jis Thank you. Thank you. Jis Jis Jis Jis Seoul has been an interesting one because it's... it's been so easy, in a way. There was so much chaos happening with the police and the viral video, and then Tokyo was kind of the same thing. It was incredibly high stress, and it's just felt like we've come to a city with this aim to create and capture good content, and I think Seoul has just given that to us. It's been such a positive end to this entire journey. That's a wrap on roof culture Asia. The weird thing about coming to the end of this project, now, is that... At the start of this trip, I knew this was the point. I'd be here, talking to you about roof culture. But at the start, I didn't have a clue what was gonna happen. It was always gonna be the unknown. We've done it. We've done it! - We've done it. - We've actually done it! Wait, that was an idea once. Now, it's a thing! We've actually made it into a thing. The commitment levels from every single person on this trip has been, like, unbelievable. That's why projects like this can happen. It's because everyone comes together at the right time, and it's amazing to be working as part of that kind of well-oiled machine. For this to happen on this trip, I guess, I guess it probably means roof culture is something quite special to all of us. It's sort of like a baby we've grown up, from training on roofs in our hometowns to Asia, you know. And we feel partially responsible for how the growth of the rooftopping scene has... has gone. We want to take it in a direction that's safe and that's positive. Jis We knew it was gonna be hard, but it's easily been the most exhausting six weeks of my entire life. Weeks and weeks of hard work and effort and mental and physical barriers that you've gotta overcome, and it's like... You look at it in January, and it's this unfathomable thing that's like, "how are we ever gonna get to the top of that?" And now, sittin' on the other side of it, it's just... yeah, it's just surreal is the only word I can kind of... It's the best word for it. How d"you feel, Max? Mate, I am super, super happy. You know, if you take stuff day by day and just, take... take things as they come, then you can overcome a task as big as roof culture Asia. Jis and the fact that we've got here simply through a bit of aspiration and teamwork is easily the most rewarding feeling of my life by far. And it's like, "fuck, that went to plan. "That worked. Everything came together." And it was... So good to be a part of. Being on roofs, since I've started training, has always been associated with fear for me. I think people can get a lot more out of life through doing things that are out of their comfort zone, doing things that scare them, whether in parkour or in life or anything. Jis "oh, you're supposed to walk on this pavement. "You're supposed to cross the road at this time. "Oh, don't go up here." There's so many things that you have to do. It's great to question things that are told to be absolute, and 100% true. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Woo-hoo! Yeah! Jis Jis you see that if you got parkour, you got... You've got fear, you've got freedom, you've got expression, all of those feelings, emotions, and disciplines, get rounded off into one form, and that is roof culture. Jis Jis
