[Phone vibrating] Woo! Hurry up, we're late. You're getting more German every day! Should we go out? Why? We've been here for a week already and we still haven't seen the wall. Terumi is online! She's got a new haircut. She looked better before. Hey! How's Berlin? - It's fun! Have you seen the wall yet? - Of course! I want to see pictures! We had some problems with the camera. Bye! Thank you. Elena! Hello! Do you know the way to Rummel-Club? Another Spaniard again! No idea, I'm sorry! First you turn left. Then you turn right. Then you cross the bridge. And then you're headed directly towards the entrance. Yes? Okay? Yes. Did you find what you were looking for? Yes, we did. If you want a drink, or to eat something, just help yourself. Wow, everybody has their own? Yes, this is normal here. Is this his? I Muffled dance music from club I The doorman is very strict, right? How do you get in? Don't be a group. Hello, Luis! What are you doing in Berlin? How are you? - Where is Carlos? In Madrid. - Aren't you here together? He's working on his Master's. Is everything okay between you? And who are your friends? Sorry. This is Maria. I'm Luis. Hi, I'm Luis. How are you? You'll never guess who I met yesterday: Xavier! Half of Madrid is here. Payback for Mallorca! Maybe it's because of the German summer. In Madrid, with 40 degrees, I would go crazy right now. - You don't get in. - Why? What's wrong? You don't like our outfits? It's because of your shoes. What's wrong with my shoes? I've been to Katmandu with these shoes. Move away from the door. Son of a bitch! - Asshole! Luis, are you coming? Go with your friends! They are not my friends. I'm with her. Okay? Okay. I Loud club music I You're gonna lose your head. Thank you. Do you have any idea what that was? Cocaine, no? Feels different. I hope it goes with my anti-depressants. I like you. I Loud club music I I Club music continues I Can we go soon? Where? To Grit's? Shit! I lost my hat! WV playing cartoons] There was this boy, he was maybe 18 or 19, in the supermarket, at the cheese counter. I was shitting and puking at the same time... I knew him from Kitty. They dragged me out of the toilet into the next room, and laid me down on the sofa. One of those party kids. But it was just my body! He was smiling at me in this submissive way. My head and my body were not communicating with each other. At home I tied him to a gas pipe with these silly pink furry handcuffs. Didn't you give them to me for my birthday? Hell is playing at Slut later. - I don't know if I'm going. I have to buy a washing machine tomorrow. I got so angry, I had to slap him. You're good. ls that your profession? Cornflakes everywhere... So, what do you do, then? First lesson: In Berlin, you never ask anyone what they do. That's exactly why I came here. He had to crawl naked on the floor to pick them up with his mouth. No, the cornflakes came later. Hello? Grit? [Hisses] Hey. hey! Hey! Can you help me'? Please! Fuck off! Come on! I've been trying to buy new shoelaces for the last 7 years. I Distant music playing I I Electronic music I [Phone ringing] I'm not available at the moment. Please leave a message. Hi Carlos, I'm in Berlin. I was thinking about you. I saw that you called. I hope you are well. I wanted to say sorry. [Coin drops into machine] Because you bore me! I don't have time now, I have to finish this. They're mine! Are you sure? Can you prove it? Yes, it's me in the pictures. It doesn't look like you. Give them back! What do you need them for? They're for a friend. So, they're for me? Ah, I like this tune! I Electronic music I I saw you last night at the club. Come with me! - You should not drive. - Don't be a pussy. Good evening, Berlin Police. Licence and registration, Do you have your ID? Could you check this? Hey! Stop! [Police siren] Come! Come up! [Police siren] [Police siren] I'm cold. Then you'd better go home. No idea how to get there. Take a taxi. I have no money. I can't take you with me. You wouldn't last the winter here. Take your clothes off. There's the shower. You should have a haircut. I'm not sure about that. You'll look much better. [Hair clippers buzzing] You'd better go now. Why? Too much, too soon. I'm only here for two more days. And I have to return your clothes. Come by... tomorrow evening. I Music playing on headphones I Next week is the enrollment deadline. For the winter term courses. Go home if you like. I'll manage alone. Don't be upset. You think we're wasting our time? We have our own problems, too! Dimi'? Dimitri'? I thought you were someone else. You look like my brother. And he's wearing the same shirt! There must be thousands of stupid shirts like this. Is that your brother? Well, Dimitri disappeared a three weeks ago, on his way home from a club. Nobody has seen him since. And the police? The police - they have no clue. They're still using typewriters in the police station. Like in Athens! Where do you think he is? Maybe it's harmless. Maybe he took a vacation, and he's having a good time lt's not Dimitri's style to leave without telling anyone, you have no idea what he's really like. Harmless, huh? By the way, I'm Luis. Hi, Luis. I'm Kostas. Hi. SH Guess what happened to me yesterday. What? I fell in love. With a blonde German girl? No. He's from the Ukraine, or something like that. He threw me into the river, and now I'm in love. When will you see him again? Tonight! Exciting. Let's drink to that! To Luis' new love! Yes. To love. III I'm looking for someone. Have you seen these guys before? Or, one of them? No, sorry. Maybe you can ask your colleague? It's important. Okay. Hey, what's wrong'? He isn't Dimitri. Don't forget why we are here. Is everything alright? Sure. I saw you in the club Saturday night. But we're not here to party. That's a shame. The drinks are cheap, the clubs never close, and the drugs are almost for free. Why are you doing that to yourself? What? All this artificial happiness. I don't get it. It's fun! Be careful, I had this conversation with her before. It's the complete absence of fear. Like there is no border between you and the others. They change you, the chemicals, and then you get discontent with reality. Isn't that a good thing? That way you can get new ideas, how to change the world. Like utopia. Bullshit! You don't change anything. You get stuck with your life. You cannot know that if you haven't tried. You get stuck, or you get lost, like Dimitri. What if he wanted to get lost? He doesn't know them. In case you remember, please give me a call. I took pictures like this the other day! Can I see? This is my brother, and this must be his friend. His lover. They don't fit together. He's the only one of Dimitri's friends who the police cannot contact. We think he might know something. - Have you seen him before? - No. I've got to go now. Oh, the Ukrainian, yeah? Don't make him wait! See you at the hostel. III [Doorbell ringing] Viktor! I need to talk to you! It's me, Luis! Are you there? Bastard! [Siren] III [Punch, shouts, coughing] What? You lost it in the Metro? Maybe it got stolen. My ID was in my wallet. I can send you your passport. I'll text you the address of my hostel, then. Do you need money? No. I met some people who can lend me something. People? Why don't you come back? I need to wait for the passport. Back to me. This is going to hurt. Who's that? A friend. I want to try out new things in life. Let's talk when you're back. Okay. How are you today, honey? What, did you miss me last night? Sorry, but something came up. It looks like you had fun without me. Come on! I'll make up for it. Leave me alone. Come with me, I'll show you something nice. Look at him! See how he is squashing the swastika with his boot? Wouldn't you like a big daddy like him to save you from the Nazis? Do you think he's sexy? I think he's... dignified. This is a dignified place. Did you take Dimitri here, too? What did you just day? Dimitri. Did you do the same tourist program with him? Look how similar we are. After you cut my hair and made me wear his fucking shirt! How do you know about Dimitri? I just know. Why didn't you contact the police? You must have seen the search posters. I have no idea what happened to Dimitri. You could tell them that, at least. Don't you get it? I can't talk to the police! I have no papers. I'll be deported. That was the first time I met him. In a garden. "'Wir trafen uns in einem Garten..." We had sex in a toilet, then he took me home to sleep. But we haven't slept. We stayed up for three days. We couldn't get enough of each other, for weeks. But then one day I gave him money to buy tickets, because we wanted to fly to Athens. And from there on, we would go by boat to a small island he knew from when he was young, because on this island, there is a river valley with a lot of butterflies. But he never came back with the tickets. Or the money. His phone was disconnected. I waited for days. How could he do that to me? Of course I've seen those search posters. But that's crap, that's bullshit. He just got scared and ran away. Scared of what? Scared of me. When I saw you in the club, I thought, for a moment, you... You must have been very disappointed when you saw it wasn't him. Luis. Luis! I'm not disappointed. Because that is how I met you. [Choking, coughing] You're gonna lose your head. It's a funny house. Is it his'? Yes. Who is he? A friend. He helped me, and I helped him. And where is he now? He's very sick. I'll take a shower. [Shower running] HEADLESS BODY FOUND IN RIVER SPREE [Shower water stops] Shit. III Early this morning, a woman was taking her little poodle for a walk along the river, and the poodle was chasing a rabbit, and discovered the head next to the rabbit hole. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to attach it to the body. [Gasping, heavy breathing] You had a bad dream! It's okay, it's okay. I have to go. No, you're on vacation. You don't need to go anywhere. And nobody will miss you. I have to leave. I made breakfast for you! Come on. I'm not hungry. Take a coffee, at least. Try some cake. I made it myself. That's not him! That's not him. [Phone ringing] Yes? You are the girl from the bar, right? Hold on a second, I just need something to write... I Old German record plays I This one. Do you know it? No. I like it. So, will you dance for me? But maybe, I dance with you. [Doorbell rings] [Record stops] You know them? They're Elena and Kostas. Dimitri's sister and his cousin. Why don't you talk with them'? Just tell them you have no idea where Dimitri is. They'll get the cops on me! You told them where I live. I did not tell them anything! You're a liar. [Doorbell rings repeatedly] They were asking people if they know you. Maybe somebody gave them a hint. You were spying on me. You went through my closet last night. You think I hadn't noticed? I'm sorry. It all felt so weird. And maybe I'm paranoid. But when I saw those pictures... You saw Dimitri's pictures? And now you think I did something to him? No, I... There's one thing I need to know. Do you trust me? They all just wanna get fucked, those fucking fascists! They can have that, then the Reichstag will burn again! And in the end, they all die. That idiot again! - In the Fuehrer Bunker. Get lost! And it's mummy's fault again! Hey Luis. So, do you have any news? The girl from the bar remembered the guy on the photos. We got his address from he, but he was not at home. His name is Viktor. She told us he's a strange guy, but I think she once had a crush on him. He applied for a job at the bar a couple of months ago, but they turned him down because he had no papers. So, he's illegal in Germany? Looks like that. Do you really think he knows something? I'm quite sure. Why doesn't he contact us? We even left a note at his door. But, if he's illegal... Come on, why's he hiding? We are not the police! What do you think? That he did something to Dimitri. I don't know. Maybe your cousin is right, and Dimitri is just lying somewhere on a beach. Come on, Luis, you don't believe this yourself. What is it with you? Why did you want to meet? To tell me stupid crap like that? Maybe we can still save my brother. If you know something, please tell me now. [Phone ringing] Hey, papa! No, nothing new. Why doesn't mama take the pills the doctor gave her? Tell her: Don't worry, everything will be alright! How do you like the site? Looks good. I just uploaded a video that his flatmate gave to me. Hey Dimitri! Do you want to be in my film'? Sure, yeah. Okay! Introducing Dimitri Stavrou, Fresh from Greece. How are you? Say hello! Hello! My German isn't so good yet. No problem. How do you like it here? The boys are sexy, the beer is good, but my flatmates are a bit square. Mama is not well at all. Do you miss your family in Greece? No way. Okay, thanks a lot! Bye! Can I see the last bit again? When he waves goodbye'? Sure. Stop! ls that a tattoo on his arm? Yes. It's a lily, he got it last year, in Amsterdam. I've met him! Yesterday. The guy who robbed me. It was him! What? Viktor is innocent... I followed him here. But you didn't recognize his face? No, if had recognized him, I would have told you earlier. Do you remember how we had that joint before you left? Yes, but I wasn't stoned. You were wasted, and it was dark. How could you recognize a small tattoo on someone's arm? I just did! You don't believe me? You lied to us about Viktor. Because I didn't want him to get deported. And now you want to make us believe that my brother beat you up and stole your wallet? It was him! Don't you get it? We're just losing our time. This is the spot. This is where he attacked me! Look! Look what I found! It must have broken when we were fighting. It is Dimitri's. [Doorbell ringing] I trust you. [Footsteps on stairs] What the fuck? Hello, Viktor. - Are you crazy? - It's okay. They won't call the police. They know about your situation. You told them that I'm illegal? We really don't care about that, it's safe with us. We only want to find my brother! We know that Dimitri is alive now! The guy who robbed me the other night, it was him! You were right. They just want to ask you a few questions. They they'll leave you alone. When was the last time you saw Dimitri? That was about four weeks ago. Where? I don't remember... in a bar. He asked me for the money, and I gave it to him, and that's the last time I've seen him. - But, maybe... - That's all! What are you doing there? Nice place. Do you want to check under my bed, if he's there? I'm sorry. So that's enough now. Take your fucking friends and go! We won't go anywhere until you've told us what you know. I don't know anything. Do you love him'? Do you love him'? If you loved my brother, you would help me now. You know what? Dimitri never even mentioned he had a sister. We were two months together, and not one word about you. He doesn't want you to find him. Fuck off. You can choose. You can help us, or I call the police. You promised you wouldn't! And you promised this asshole would help us! Hey! Hey! If Dimitri needed money so badly, why didn't he ask us'? We could have helped him. I really have to find him soon... I must call my airline and change my flight home. I missed it this morning. Because of us? I'm sorry. This is Luis Alvarez. I need to change my flight because I missed it today, a flight to Madrid. Can I have the code of your missed flight, please? Yeah - EX 075. Okay, when do you want to fly? Maybe Friday. Or Saturday. Just a minute. We have to see him again. Viktor doesn't want to talk to us. But the police can make him talk. I could book you on a flight on Saturday morning, but I've just seen that there are some free seats on Friday. Let me check. Thank you. Bye! They told me I didn't miss my flight. This morning somebody checked in at Schonefeld airport under my name. "Somebody?" Somebody who found the printout with my flight information in my wallet. Somebody who has my ID, and who looks like me. Dimitri. He's in Madrid. I'm sure you'll like my ex. Carlos is a great host. You should come with us to Madrid, Luis. It's not good if you stay here alone. I'll come after you in a few days, and I'll help you find Dimitri. I hope you make up with Viktor. You are a true friend. No big deal. I have a strange feeling... Please, promise that you'll look after yourself. I promise. I promise. III [Doorbell ringing] [Door buzzes] [Doorbell ringing] [Knocking] Viktor? It's me! I'm alone. I have good news. Grit? Hey, Grit! Grit! I knew it was you. What do you want? Because of you, I have to pay the fucking fire brigade! But, you locked me in. We only went out for the after-hours, that's all. We would have come back. I didn't know that. You better give me the 500 Euro I have to pay. - What? - You owe me 500 Euro. Listen, Grit - I don't have any money because my wallet got stolen, and... Your wallet got stolen? You are a liar, and a pussy. Fuck you! My friend saw you making out with that guy. Fucking homo pussy, that's what you are. [Car horns, tires screeching, car crash] Viktor? Viktor... Finally, you're awake. Elena and Kostas, I sent them away. They are in Madrid, I tricked them. You are safe now. Thanks. That was a very nice thing of you to do. Does it hurt you? [Groans] What happened? You don't remember? You had an accident. I found you in the street. And you took me here? Yes. Do you like our new home? Shouldn't I be in the hospital? Don't worry. I'll take care of you. Where's my mobile phone? You lost it? For the pain. Where are you going? I'll be back soon. Don't leave me here. It won't take long, just wait. Don't leave me alone! You're not alone. Sleep now. [Door locking] [Heavy breathing] [Shouts in pain] [Shouts in pain] WANTED FOR ASSAULT [Dog barking, growling] [Phone vibrating] Carlos, you must help me! They're after me. What? Who is after you, Luis? They want to finish me off. Wait! Luis? Luis? They're hunting me down! And Viktor wants to kill me! Who? - He killed Dimitri, now it's Dimitri wasn't killed. He's here with me. What? Your friends, Elena and Kostas, they found him in a bar in Chueca. But they're chasing me, too! They are here! You take too many drugs. I thought you loved me! Do you want to talk to him'? I'll pass you on. I thought you were on my side! Without you I'm lost. Dimitri! [Dog barking] [Banging on door, metal shaking] I Club music fades in I Sorry for staring at you! For a second, I thought you were my boyfriend. That guy over there. You look a bit like him. He just ran into his sister from Greece. What's your name? Uh, I'm Luis. Luis, this is Dimitri. This is my sister Elena, and my cousin Kostas. - Hello! - How are you? They were so worried. They thought something happened to me. You could have called, at least! We didn't have no phone connection in the river valley. Luis! Where have you been? I was here all the time! You want to dance? I Club music I Hey. hey wait! Who are you? Viktor! Are you there? I'm coming. I'm coming over. SH
