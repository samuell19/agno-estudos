® Arun's collections ® (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (WOMAN SHRIEKS) (FUNK MUSIC PLAYING) My Purge playlist. I put a lot of thought into it, especially this final tune as it will be the last song you'll ever hear. Tough choice. (BREATHING DEEPLY) And then I thought, George Clinton! The king of interplanetary funkmanship. George's psychedelic rock will leave you feeling funky, obviously. And soulful, which is the least I can do. Now, we played a lot of Purge games tonight, and we have just one more. It's simple, yet effective. - It's called "Mommy's Choice." - (WHIMPERS) Mommy, which one of you will survive this year's Purge? (STRUGGLING) (SCREAMING) No! No! No! (ALL CLAMORING) MALE REPORTER : This is just one of a dozen protests around our capital after reports emerged claiming that the New Founding Fathers had been using the Purge to help their own economic agenda. Here's a recent statement by incendiary Purge detractor Dante Bishop. For the past 20 years, the NFFA has taken to legalized murder to decrease the poor population, which in turn keeps the government's spending down. Less welfare, less healthcare, less housing. MALE REPORTER : Recent polling suggests that the growing anti-Purge sentiment may have a monumental effect on the upcoming presidential election. Establishment NFFA candidate Minister Edwidge Owens has been losing ground to wildcard Independent candidate Senator Charlie Roan. Eighteen years ago, Roan was forced to watch the brutal execution of her entire family on Purge Night and entered the political arena soon after with one goal in mind. To put an end to the annual holiday. I have no doubt that the soul of our country is at stake. The Purge has to come to an end. MALE REPORTER : Senator Roan is proving to be the greatest threat to the NFFA regime since they first took office 25 years ago... (GLASS THUDS) Is the cunt that close? All polls have her a point behind. I'm sorry, Caleb, I've done... No sorrys, Minister, you're doing a great job. Let us put you where you need to be. Thomas. We have our people out there countering all this anti-NFFA bullshit. What else can we do? (SHOUTING) We do whatever it fucking takes! I have had it with all these idealistic pigs. They want the impossible. Everyone to have. Some cannot have. Not enough to go around. It's time to do something about all these cocksuckers, like that rat Bishop and the cunt Senator trying to dismantle everything we've built. We are going to use this year's Purge to do some spring cleaning, gentlemen. FEMALE MODERATOR : And where will you be spending Purge Night, Minister? I will once again be presiding over my party's Midnight Purge Mass because I still believe in it. The Midnight Purge Mass, where our great NFFA leaders gather together and slaughter innocents. Is murder our new religion? FEMALE MODERATOR : Senator. Murder is our new religion. That's snappy. No, the Midnight Purge Mass where NFFA leaders gather to celebrate the night that saved this country from economic ruin. We have other ways. Now, America is built upon sacrifice. From the Revolution all the way to World War II. Our Lord God sacrificed his only Son... Everybody look alive. ERIC : Copy. We have eyes on her, boss. MINISTER OWENS : That's why we must sacrifice every year in order to rid ourselves of hatred. Remember what I said. She moves, we move. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Now, the stats are undeniable. There has been far less crime... (TAPPING PODIUM) This is crap. Do I have to listen to this? Send me to the Principal's office. I can't listen to this anymore. Okay, we'll send you to the Principal's office 'cause you can't keep your mouth shut. More low-income people are killed during the Purge than anyone else. (SCATTERED CHATTER) The money generated from the Purge lines the pockets of the NRA and insurance companies. WOMAN : Don't listen to her! Any government system that relies on violence to answer its problems must be rebooted. She's doing good, Leo. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) It is time to call upon the better angels of our nature. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) He is going to keep lying. Jesus Christ. There she goes again. - Secure the audience. - I'm on it. - SENATOR ROAN : I'd like to talk to you guys. - (CHEERING CONTINUES) Put a leash on her, Chief. She's no good to anyone dead. You got it, Leo. - Okay. We're on the move. - ERIC : Copy, boss. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Go sit down. I'm happy to stay here for the rest of the night. Stay close to her. Keep it tight. Go out. Purge and purify. Purge and purify! Hi. Thank you again. MALE REPORTER : As she's done many times before, Senator Roan broke security protocol, walking off the stage, stepping into the audience. Tell you this much, she got 'em little titties, but she got some big-ass balls. She ain't got a snowball's chance in a steam bath of winning this thing, but she be taking on them ol' white-haired George Washington wannabe mofos all by herself. And to that, I say bully for her. Oh, horseshit. She's full of it too. Nothing'll ever change. Hey, Laney. Laney, Laney? I think we've offended Marcos with our anti-Senator talk. The Senator's going to win. She's gonna make real changes too. You'll see. All she needs is Florida. She gets the 29 electoral votes from Florida, that puts her over 270. - She can do it. - JOE : Smartass. All that useless shit and can't butter a damn bagel correctly. - I could butter your bagel, boss. - (GASPS) - Oh, you'd butter my bagel? - LANEY : Mmm... Well, you got jokes over there. Yeah, you just be careful, kid, with all that hope, 'cause it can be a bad thing. Hope can lead to a lot of letdown. Tell him, Irish I. Excuse me, what? I'm not paying attention. I'm thinking about waffles and pussy. That's all I ever really think about, actually. - Mmm-mmm... - JOE : Irish I, ladies and gentlemen. (ALL CHUCKLING) The fuck you laughing at? I'm dead serious. - Ah, fuck! - (LANEY LAUGHING) The New Founding Fathers believe in fairness. And we hear what the people are saying. That the Purge benefits the rich and the powerful. That was never the intention. From this point on, no one is exempt. The rules protecting level 10 government officials have been revoked. Yeah. Come in. You seeing this? Yeah, NFFA is revoking the Purge rule that protects government officials of ranking 10 on Purge Night. Yeah, I'll secure a safe house and full security detail on the night. No. I'm staying home on Purge Night. Senator, I don't think that's a good idea. If the voters get wind that I'm hiding in a fortress like some rich asshole, I lose votes and the NFFA wins. I stay home like 99% of the population. Make it safe. Whatever it takes. Right. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) (SCREAMS) (SINISTER LAUGHTER) Half price on all masks. Come on inside. The Purge is Halloween for adults! (SINISTER LAUGHTER) Hordes of young adults are arriving from Spain, Denmark, South Africa. They're being called Murder Tourists as they are here for one reason. To Purge. We're here to experience the Purge. To kill. Release all the anger and hate. To be like Americans. We're very excited. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Foreigners coming to our capital to kill. Murder tourism. It's the new booming business in our country this year. MRS. SABIAN : Murder tourism. What's happened to our country, Joe? Mrs. Sabian, I wish I knew. But you take care of yourself, Mrs. S. Next time you need something, just give us a call. I'll have Marcos run it over and save you the trip, okay? MRS. SABIAN : I come by to flirt with you, Joe! What? MRS. SABIAN : No one's gonna take that from me. JOE : Ah, you better get out of here. Get on out of here. (MRS. SABIAN CHUCKLING) Yeah! Oh. Get out of here. Now she nasty. She... That's a nasty woman, right there. (PACKETS THUDDING) (LAUGHING) Joe. Mira. Son of a bitch! (DOOR BELL DINGING) Where's he going? I never saw him move so damn fast. All right, girls, give it up. I won't have to call the police. Get outta my face, old man! Let's not do this the hard way, okay? I'm giving you an out. All right, give up the candy or I'll have to take it away from you. You touch me and I scream "rape," you cocksucking pig. Now walk away. LANEY : Give it back. Who are you, bitch? Better get out of my way! That's Laney Rucker, Kimmy. Laney Rucker? Holy shit. (CHUCKLES) OG Queen badass? Yo! They called you Pequeña Muerte. Little Death. (LAUGHING) Yo, you're my motherfucking hero. That makes me proud. Now give back whatever you stole. And apologize. Oh, my God. Sorry, mister. I was just playin'. So, Ms. Rucker, what happened to you? You look all whitish now. Later, Ms. Rucker. Wish I met you back in the day. Excuse me. (GROANS) Well... You were a lot more respectful back when you were shoplifting here. - (CHUCKLES) - You know, I distinctly remember one time, you called me "sir." Oh, bullshit. But listen, I just want to say thank you. You're my family, Joe. I appreciate that. Thank you, Laney. (CHUCKLES) (CHATTER OVER POLICE RADIO) LEO : I want men in there. I want men in there. I want a lot of men back there. She's got some security, but I'm revamping the entire thing. We got new barricades on all the doors, all the windows back and front. CHIEF COUPER : Looks safe. Chief, if you tell me it's safe one more time, I'm gonna throw you down the steps. CHIEF COUPER : Please don't do that. Men here. Men here. We got a security monitor system in this room. We got eyes and ears on everything. This is her safe room. She is not to leave her safe room. No one is to go inside her safe room. Do we understand each other? This is a mess. She's not gonna be happy about it. I don't care if she's happy, Chief. And I want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea. No matter what we do here, this house and this Senator are at risk on Purge Night. - You understand me? - Duly noted. Let's lock it down. "Let's lock it down." It's just me and you, pal. Tell me what you want me to do. I'm there. Go downstairs, make sure they take care of the doors. - Keep an eye on that guy. - Done. BISHOP ON TV: The NFFA has created predatory capitalism where profit-making is the essence of democracy. (CELLPHONE RINGING) We've come to D.C. to make some changes. FEMALE REPORTER : That was Dante Bishop. Like his predecessor Carmelo Johns... - (PHONE BEEPS) - Joe's Deli. ...Dante is suspected of eliminating wealthy NFFA supporters on Purge Nights. Excuse me? And many are wondering why he has come to Washington this year. Wait, wait. Hold it. Wait a minute. Why are you raising my rates now? Today? Do you know what today is? Yeah, but look, I... (STUTTERING) Yeah... I can't afford that. What do you mean, you're sorry? Yeah, I'm talking to you. Let me speak to your... Your super... - Son of a... Son of a bitch! - (PHONE DROPS) Joe? What the hell's going on? JOE : The damn insurance company. They just raised the premium on my Purge coverage. By thousands. The day before the damn Purge. If I don't pay it by tomorrow, I have no Purge coverage for this store. They can't do that. Yeah, well, they just did it. Just lock the place down, Joe. Yeah, but that's not enough. If I have no insurance, I am screwed. (SIGHS) I'll just have to protect this place myself. - Are you crazy? - MARCOS : That's not a good idea, boss. Look, we love this place, too, Joe. I've been coming here since I was born. But it's just stuff. It can be replaced. You can't be. Yeah, but what about what you do on Purge Night, Laney? Huh? Is that not the pot calling the kettle brown? No? That's different, Joe, and you know that. I'm protected, and you won't be. This is all I got, guys. This is my slice of the pie. (EXHALES) Man, I cannot, I can't lose this place. I can't lose this place. Hold on, Joe. Let's talk about this. Everything is in place. Team's in position. Ten minutes to lockdown, boss. (BREATHING DEEPLY) Hey, Mama. (DOOR CLOSES) You ready? Yeah. Vaya con Dios. Okay, let's go. Okay. This is gonna be home for the next 12 hours. You need anything, you contact me and me only. - Clear? - Clear. Let's begin. (BEEPING) (SHUTTERS WHIRRING) (WHIRRING STOPS) (ALARM BLARING ON TV) FEMALE VOICE ON TV: This is not a test. This is your Emergency Broadcast System announcing the commencement of the annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. government. Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours. Here we go. Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. And, for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt. Blessed be our New Founding Fathers, and America, a nation reborn. May God be with you all. (SIREN BLARING) - (STATIC) - I see you, Bobby. (EXHALES) You know you can relax now, right? No, I'll relax in the morning. Am I interrupting? Senator, you should be in the den. Eric, thank you for being here tonight. My pleasure. Leo, have a drink with me. You don't have a choice. Sounds serious. Don't say a word. Or I'll stick my foot up your ass. (DRINK POURING) (SIGHS) Sit. It's water, Leo. Are you scared? I'm terrified. What made you apply for this position? I like your politics. No. No bullshit. I want a real answer. I lost my son some years ago. He was killed. I almost did something on Purge Night that would've destroyed a lot of lives. I want this night gone. I know you do, too. Especially after what you lost. Yeah. Despite all of that, you have a big problem with how I do things. You take risks, Senator. My job is to eliminate risks and keep you alive. You don't make that easy. The soul of this country is at stake, Leo. The only way that I can win is to risk everything, and that includes my life. (EXHALES) - (MUSIC PLAYING) - WOMAN : Peace, not Purge! (LAUGHING) You go, girls! Have a drink on us! LANEY : Can't you see we're working? PURGE PARTIER: Purge, motherfuckers! (ALL SHOUTING) Just gonna wait right here and see what happens. PURGE PARTIER: Purge! They probably won't bother us, okay? - (GRUNTING) - (GASPS) (SOFTLY) Purge. Purge. Purge. Go, go, go! Let's move! (MEN SHOUTING) (MEN LAUGHING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (WOMAN CRYING) WOMAN : Help! Help! Please! Somebody help! Help! Help! (CONTINUES CRYING) Please! Please! (SCREAMS) Stop! Stop! Please, stop! Please, help him! Something's going down. Hey, looks like someone needs our services. Let's go. Let's do this. Stop. WOMAN : I shot my husband! I shot him. Oh, God! LANEY : Okay. Calm down. Tell me what happened. (WOMAN CRYING) Oh, no! It was a mistake! I'm sorry! (MAN SCREAMING IN DISTANCE) (JOE EXHALES) MARCOS : Hey, boss! It's me! It's me. Come on outta there, boy. Good Lord, son. It's Purge Night. You don't sneak up on black people. (SIGHS) Good night, blue cheese. Where the hell you going? And why you carrying a chair? I like sitting. Yeah, well, you ain't gonna be staying. Look, you know I appreciate you coming out here to watch my back, but I'm good. - I got this. - No. (PANTING) I'll stay. Nothing else to do. Look, please don't be a pain in the ass. I want you to go home and be safe. I don't want you out here on Purge Night, son. I got this!

I got a wicked sweet tooth tonight. And I want my candy bar. And I'm gonna take it. You don't got the balls to stop me. (LAUGHING) (SHRIEKS) Fuck! MARCOS : I have the balls. Now go. I already took care of my mom and dad tonight. You're next. I want my candy bar, cocksucker. (GASPING) Come on! (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (TIRES SCREECHING) So, what's up with that? Every day in Juárez was like the Purge. I know how to shoot, boss. Son, I really wish you'd stayed home. (CANS CLANKING) (CANS OPENING) - I don't know. - It's that time. Eric. What are you still doing up here? You're on first floor duty. How was your chat? Enlightening. Go. Chief, find a bedroom. I got it from here. All right, Leo. Boys. Why don't you take a break? Go watch some TV, huh? It's gonna be a long night. Yes, sir. (SILENCED GUNSHOTS) (STATIC) I'm coming outside, boys. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (BEEPING) (WHIRRING) How ya doing out there, Bobby? Sniper One, radio check. Bobby, radio check. Sniper Two, radio check. Sniper Two. (SILENCED GUNSHOTS) (DOOR OPENING) Someone is coming for you. - What? - Put that on. - Leo, the house is surrounded... - Move, move! I'm moving. What are you... You said you had men on the roof. You have snipers. - Not anymore. Not anymore. - What do you mean, not anymore? - Someone betrayed us. - What? - I can't trust anyone. Put on that vest. - (BEEPING) Listen to me! This isn't a drill.

(GRUNTING) (PANTING) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) - What the fuck is this? - (BEEPING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO) I don't know what the fuck that is. (STATIC) Our mark may be outside. Repeat. Your mark may be outside. Check your perimeters. (SIGHS) No payment unless we find her. Fuck. I see her! (GUNSHOTS) (BEEPING) Down! LEO : (PANTING) Come here. Move. Go! Go! Go! Go! (GUNSHOTS) Hey, Joe, you up there? Is that Laney? Marcos! My guys! How you all doing tonight? We're good. You? Ah... (SIGHS) I just dropped someone off at triage. His wife shot him because she couldn't stand looking at his face anymore. She said Purging didn't make her feel any better like they said it would. Just stay safe, Lane. Anything happens, do not hesitate to call us. Yeah, same goes for you. - Okay? - All right. All right. (VAN DRIVING AWAY) God, I hate that she's out there like that. WOMAN : (SCREAMING) Help me! Help me! LEO : Stop. Stop! (BOTH PANTING) What was that? Some kind of homegrown militia? Those were skilled mercs with a lot of money behind them. Enough to get to someone on our staff. I'm guessing it's the Minister. The Minister, the NFFA, the whole fucking lot of them. I'm getting too close. (LEO PANTING) It's a lot of blood, Leo. We should call someone. I don't know who to trust. We are on our own. You understand me? Okay. Where do we go? East. Out of the city. There are a lot of threats. (EXHALES) There's a lot of death. (VEHICLE APPROACHING) MAN : Purge Sanitation Services. Death collection haul. Purge victim removal and disposal. Keep Washington clean. It's okay. Death collection haul. This is how it's gonna go now. Like you said, fate of the country's at stake. Okay? It's my show now. Look, I'm not an idiot. I know what you're capable of. I'm the one who hired you. But if I see something I don't like, I'm not gonna be quiet about it. It's not in my nature. (BREATHING DEEPLY) Senator, I need you to follow me. (SHOUTING IN DISTANCE) Come on. (MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY OVER DRONE) It's Tommy, sir. He's in bad shape. He's unconscious. Everyone else up there is dead. Get him to the ground unit. Get him stabilized. Then start street surveillance. I'll search from above. We need her alive, so let's find her before the crazies do. Sir. (MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY OVER DRONE) They're tracking us. Where? I'm not seeing them. How are they seeing us? Mercenaries? No. That's a homemade drone. Purgers. (MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY OVER DRONE) SENATOR ROAN : Now what? Run. Fast. (INDISTINCT CHATTER CONTINUES OVER DRONE) Come, come, come! It's behind you, Leo. Thirty-five yards back, 15 yards up. (BOTH PANTING) - (SCREAMING) - (GUNSHOT) (ALL GRUNTING) - Down! - (GUNSHOT) (SCREAMS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Reason I'm so hard on you, son, like I am is someday I'd like to make you a partner. Yep. Oh, boy. Coming here from another country like you did. Having your own business. American dream is still alive. (MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) WOMAN : Whoo-hoo! (PURGERS SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) We love you, America. America is the greatest country in the world. WOMAN : We are gonna kill you. (ALL CLAMORING) (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) We will now Purge. - We will torture you and violate your flesh. - (GRUNTING) Remove your skin and share in your blood. This is the American way. (GUNSHOTS) JOE : Senator. Come with us. (SHUTTERS OPENING) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... (EXHALES) - Stay. - Yeah. Yeah. (EXHALES) JOE : Well, this is my place. You can stay all night if you want to. Now, I got to ask you 'cause I'm just a nosey old dog. What in the Mississippi fuck was you doing outside on Purge Night, Senator? (BREATHING DEEPLY) Yeah. There was an assassination attempt on me. I can't thank you enough, Mr... I'm sorry, I know you told me. - Dixon. You can call me Joe, Senator. - Yeah. Joe, I'm Charlie. - Charlie. - Yeah. That's Marcos right there. Marcos is... He's a fan of yours. - Hi, Marcos. - Hey, Senator. - He actually think you can win this thing. - Oh, yeah? (LAUGHS) Shit! Tell her what she need to do to win, Marcos. No, it's not my place to say. Well, you saved my life, Marcos. I'd like to hear it, please. Florida is the key. You have to get the elders. That's smart. He's not wrong, Joe. What do you think? I don't think you got a damn chance. Well, have a little faith. Well, I lost my faith in the system a long time ago, Senator. Water? Thank you. Place is moderately secure. Cameras. Maybe we stay here. "Maybe we stay here"? Where you going? You going back out there? Joe, do you have a first aid kit? Leo, my security, was shot. - I'm fine. - You're not fine. - I'm fine. - You're not. Sit. You want me to take it off? (SIGHS) It's okay. It's nothing. Yeah? Doesn't look like nothing. (GROANS) Let me see. Let me see. I know a little bit about first aid. I could help you. The bullet's deep. - You need stitches. - Yeah. But we can't do that here. Right. Clean it up. Patch it up. Come on. Move. Okay. Fast. Come on. (LEO WINCING) What about you guys? Who are you? - Is this necessary? - It's very necessary. You, what's your name? Where you from? Marcos Dali. Mexico City. But I've been an American citizen for two years. You got a record? Not here. What did you do in Mexico? I tried to survive. What are you doing out on Purge Night? Protecting the deli against looters because my boss lost his Purge insurance yesterday. Yeah, that's something you can look into, Senator. Insurance companies screwing the working man. Yeah? What's your name, pal? You know what, Mr. Secret Service Man? You should be thanking my black ass for helping you instead of interrogating me. SENATOR ROAN : His name is Joe Dixon. - LEO : Joe Dixon, have I offended you? - JOE : Yeah. Yeah, man, just a little bit. Your feelings are not a concern of mine. Little respect. That's all I need. Everyone shut up, please! - SENATOR ROAN : What? - Look. (LAUGHTER) KIMMY: You stupid motherfucker! You should have let us take the candy bar! Now, you're gonna fuckin' pay for it, you stupid son of a bitch! Whoo! It's a good night to Purge, isn't it? Oh, hell! Who the hell is that? The looters I was telling you about. Purge Night, Senator. What did you expect? (KIMMY SCREAMS) Hey, you old fuck! I'm back. And I brought some friends. And I'm gonna get that candy bar. They have chainsaws and they're coming inside. All right. I got to get you outta here. Yeah, but they're at both entrances. Then I'm gonna Purge by killing you and burning this bitch to the ground! I gotta call her. Who? We have a friend out there in a triage van. You trust this friend? Hey, you still questioning my integrity. Boy, you are a piece of work, man. (SIGHS) Come on, girl, pick up. RONDO : Those motherfuckers blindsided us, man. - I gotta get back out there. - No, no, no. You're not going anywhere. I told your mom I'd look after you. Just hurry up. Hurry up and bandage me up so I can get back out there. Okay, you promised me you were gonna stay home tonight. Well, I want to Purge tonight. - No. - I want to Purge. Laney, what? Laney! (BREATHING DEEPLY) For real, Laney? Yeah. For real. You heard me right. Senator Roan. Call me back, Lane. We need you bad. - (GIRLS SHOUTING OUTSIDE) - (SIGHS) She'll call back. We can't count on your friend. These kids will be in here soon. What do we do? Okay. We're gonna work as a team to protect this woman. You gentlemen understand what's at stake here, yes? - Yes? All right. - Yes. (SINGING) We are gonna Purge today Purge today, Purge today We are gonna Purge today Burn this bitch down Fuck! Okay, you take the back, I'm gonna take the front. I'll take the front with you. No, you're not gonna be on the frontline. Are you crazy, Leo? Give me a gun. I will give you a gun, but you're not on the frontline. Over my dead body. Then you better drop dead. JOE : I think he's right, Senator. Thank you, Deli Man. Deli Man? I agree with you, you still throwing attitude? Okay, enough! Executive decision. I'm with Leo. We need as many guns as we can get. (WHIRRING) Go, go, go! Move, move, move! Down. Just point and shoot. Do not shoot me. (WHIRRING CONTINUES) KIMMY: If I want some candy, I'll take some candy! I'll take whatever the fuck I want! My mom's not gonna like this! KIMMY: This is what the Purge is all about. Me getting mine. You getting yours and nobody stopping anybody! Bye-bye, motherfucker! Say goodnight, cocksucker. Because here comes your candy girl! Here they come. - (ALL LAUGHING) - BIKINI GIRL : Fucking asshole! (LAUGHING) Hold on! (TIRES SCREECHING) Wait here. (COCKING) - (YELLING) - (COCKING GUN) Pequeña Muerte is back, bitches. (BANGING) LANEY : Hey, guys! I got your message. Laney! - This is our girl. - Go, go, go! Holy shit, it really is you. - Where do we go? - The van. LEO : Go. LANEY : Come on, Joe. I'll be with you in a minute. I'll be there. (WHIRRING) (SIGHS) Joe, come on. You get out of here, kid. I'm staying. They'll kill you. JOE : Go now! If you stay, I stay. Just leave. Joe, listen to me. For some reason, the Senator ended up in our neighborhood, in your deli. Maybe it's our duty to help protect her. We'll rebuild the deli. Whatever it takes, you and me. I promise. LANEY : Come on, guys. Now! Where we headed? Underground triage center service in the community. It's completely secure. (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO) Expand our perimeter. They're on foot. They can't be far. MERC: Earl, spoke with the ground unit. Tommy regained consciousness. Says he got a shot off at the Senator's security. He thinks the bullet is lodged in his shoulder. (CHUCKLES) (SQUELCHING) (YELLING) How the hell did it get to this? (CLEARS THROAT) Who is he? Why is he cuffed? Rondo. Two bullet holes delivered by a rival gang, but he's a good kid. He's chained up because I didn't want him Purging anymore. So, Senator... NFFA made a move on your ass. Seems that way. Goddamn conniving, duplicitous, crooked, cocksucking politicians. Agreed. We're not all that bad. My experience, Senator? My people are on our own, no matter what you all say or promise. I'm kinda confused here. Who the hell is this lady? (SCOFFS) You big dope! You give people from the neighborhood a bad name. (GUNSHOTS) LEO : Just some Purgers. That's crossfire. Not for us. You seem really close. How do you know each other? Joe gave me a job seven years ago when I first came here from Mexico. I've been working for him ever since. And you? Joe's been looking out for me since I was a kid. And he helped me get out of the life. Sounds like Joe is a saint. Yeah, well, I ain't no saint. I'm just doing my part. Riding around in a van, on Purge Night, helping people? It's pretty dangerous. Unwritten Purge rule is leave the triage units alone. It's true, for the most part. Seriously, Laney, who the hell are these people? - LANEY : (LAUGHING) Do you read? - (GUNSHOTS) LEO : Down! Everybody down! Anybody hit? SENATOR ROAN : I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. - You sure? - Yes. - JOE : Laney! - I'm okay. Oh, Jesus Christ! Rondo is dead. (GRUNTS) What the fuck was that? - They found us, Senator. - (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) I want you to turn left! Go under the freeway. - Move! Move! - Yes. MAN : Tonight, the gates of hell will open and invite me in. It's survival of the fucking fittest. Who's the fittest? I'm the fittest of them all! What the fuck? We're gonna lose them under there. Ground unit, get your asses moving and get here now. We got them cornered. (ALL YELLING) (METAL CLANGING) (ROARING) Turn here and stop. (YELLING CONTINUES) Do we just wait here? No, they'll have units on the ground. They're gonna be all over us. We all better figure it out fast 'cause I don't like it here. SENATOR ROAN : It doesn't make any sense. There was no way they could've known we'd be in this van. Doesn't matter. They did. You son of a bitch. Leo? - Leo? - Move. - (WINCES) - Leo. (LEO MOANS) (BREATHING DEEPLY) SENATOR ROAN : Oh! Leo, what the hell are you doing? Leo, what... (GRUNTING) (SENATOR ROAN GASPS) Trace bullet. That's how he found us. Just leave it here and drive away. They'll never know we left here. Yeah, well, I wish it were that simple. You all need to see this. There's a whole bunch of negroes coming right this way. And we sitting up here like a bucket of motherfucking chicken. (COCKING) (BEEPING) What's your ETA? Two minutes, Earl. MAN : Open the door, now! (ALL CLAMORING) What are we gonna do? They'll start blasting if we move. They'll start blasting if we don't. Open the door! Open the door, now! MAN : Open the goddamn doors! What's the plan? (ALL SHOUTING) (WHISTLING) MAN : Yo, yo, yo! Quiet down! Quiet down! - What the hell is that? - MAN : Quiet down! MAN : I know what I heard. I know what I heard. (MAN WHISTLING) I told you I ain't no saint. Everybody's got a past. That was a Crip whistle. They just threw it back. If this is the right set, we should be good. MAN : I know, I know what I heard. I know. All right. We're not gonna hurt you. Just help my fuckin' boy. He's gonna die. We help you, you do something for us. (BEEPING CONTINUES) They're still under the overpass, but they're on the move. Get your asses in there. (BEEPING) They stopped. Stop the truck. We're going on foot. (BEEPING CONTINUES) (BEEPING RAPIDLY) Clear! (BEEPING STOPS) Earl, we found the trace bullet, but no sign of the target. - Yeah, we're heading back. - (WHISTLING) Ground unit, come in. Ground unit, come in. - Come in, I need a fuckin' sitrep. - (GUNSHOTS) (GANG MEMBER LAUGHING) GANG MEMBER ON RADIO : Fuck you, motherfucker! No one following. We're clear. DAWN : We're a few blocks away. I'm gonna call in and tell them we have a special guest. Where are we? You'll see. (MEN CHATTERING) What is this place? We call this a Safe Zone. - Senator, Dante Bishop. - Mr. Bishop. This is Angel. Dawn called. Told me you guys were coming through. So the NFFA came at you tonight? Can't say I'm surprised. Let me show you around, get you settled in. You set all this up, Mr. Bishop? Yes, this is my organization. We have doctors, and nurses, EMTs, paramedics. This is their way of protesting this damn night. LEO : How many people know about this place? Just the volunteers, and the homeless that we invite in. Look, these are the real victims of the Purge. The people that the NFFA are trying to eliminate so that they don't have to take care of them anymore. These men that are armed, you'll have them at all the entrances and the rooftop? Yes. My men will keep you safe. Or as safe as you can be on Purge Night. Appreciate it. - Mr. Bishop. - Yeah. Thank you, for all of this. I am impressed. Well, don't thank me. Thank the volunteers. Mr. Bishop, I've heard stories of tactics that you employ on Purge Night. I can't say that I agree with any of it. I'll tell you what. You get elected, you stop this night, and I don't have to do what I do anymore. Let's go, Angel. Fair enough. BISHOP : You hold down the fort here. Keep an eye on her. And keep her and her people quiet. Okay? All right, let's go! I want access to every surveillance camera in the city. We'll do a grid search for that fucking triage van. It's out there somewhere. Find it. Yeah. Your crew? Your guys? They feel like family? Boss. We did the right thing. Yeah. But it's time to go. Gotta get back to the deli. What? No. Are you fucking crazy? We're safe here. Laney, you know I'll walk back if I have to. Fine. I'll drive you. But if we run into any problems, we're coming right back here. Deal. SENATOR ROAN : Really? Can you do that? We'll see her again, Marcos. And she's safe here. Let's hit it. I don't know, but I bet it was really cool. (LAUGHS) It is, it is. - Hey, you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Good. - I'm gonna go take a look around. - Okay. Stay here. Okay, boss. What are you doing here? - Hand. - Why are you here? (GRUNTING) (CLATTERING) (GRUNTING) What the hell's going on here? - He was snooping around! - Hey, hey! Okay, okay, okay. - Hey! Hey. - It's all right. It's all right. - Red, back up. It's okay. - (MAN CHOKING) Just put the gun down, all right? Everybody's okay. Back up. We're okay. All right? All right? We're good. It's all good, okay? I'm just getting my weapon. What's going on? Just doing my job. Senator, it's just a misunderstanding. Why don't we go back outside? Come on. - SENATOR ROAN : Are you seeing this, Leo? - LEO : Yes, Senator. Senator, why don't we go outside... Stop. Those are the Minister's biggest financial supporters. The NFFA. Our Lady of Sorrows. Is that where the Minister is going to be tonight for the Purge Mass? - We believe so. - You believe... (SCOFFS) What is all this? Why do you have all this? You're gonna assassinate him. You're gonna assassinate the Minister tonight, aren't you? You know, somebody's got to say it out loud. What in the fuck happened tonight? Nobody's gonna believe it. Mmm-hmm. Irish Ike's gonna be like, "Bullshit. - "Now where's my waffles and pussy?" - "...and pussy?" (ALL LAUGHING) He got that one-track mind. That boy done lost his mind. Shit. I hope he's okay tonight. Yeah. Hold on, guys. Look. Those are government trucks. I saw them on YouTube from last year's Purge. And they're going straight back towards the Safe Zone. You cannot do this. I need to win this thing fair and fucking square. They are not playing fair and fucking square and neither should we. This church will be locked up like Fort Knox. You'll never get through. You're gonna get slaughtered. Four churches were built on that site. The original by your boy George Washington over 200 years ago. The man liked to have escape tunnels attached to all his structures. They're all over D.C. The tunnel under the original church has been closed up since the '50s. But we reopened it. We're gonna walk right through there and into that church without anybody even knowing it. The original Founding Fathers are about to fuck over the New Founding Fathers. Now how you like that for irony? How do you know where this mass is gonna be? Because we do whatever it takes. We did this for you, Senator. No, it's not for me. Get your boss on the phone. I need to talk to him. - He's not here. - Angel, listen to me. You call him. You tell him he does this and the Minister becomes a martyr. I cannot have my presidency built on murder. You see that. He will not leave this to the voters. He does not believe in the American system. Angel, believe in me. I can make this happen. We do. That's why we're trying to pave a way for you to the White House so you can make changes. SENATOR ROAN : You're gonna cost me the White House. It's Laney. She says there's trucks approaching us. What? Who is that? Government soldiers. That's the NFFA eliminating all their enemies this year. They're here for Bishop, but they will kill you. - You need to evacuate your people. - We can't move the injured. - I need to get her out of here now. - There's a way out back. LEO : Where does it come out? The alleyway down to Third and Thompson. LEO : Third and Thompson. Give me the phone. Laney, I need you at Third and Thompson now. Yeah, we'll meet you there. (TIRES SCREECHING) So, we're driving right back into that war zone? Stupid! (ALL CHATTERING) All these people. We'll protect them. Please, stop the assassination. - It's too late. Now go. Stay safe. - Go! So what we supposed to be, like some superheroes or something? That ain't what I do. I hate this night! Ah, shit. Hell with it. Come on. Shit. Let's do it. Let's go get 'em. I can't believe we're outside again. I'm gonna get you through this. (WIRE TWANGING) (MAN EXCLAIMING) MAN 1: My God, it's so close! MAN 2: At your own risk now! (LAUGHING) Are you fucking kidding me? - Ready? - Yeah. - One. - MAN 2: Go for it! - Two. - MAN 1: Try your luck! Go! (MEN MOANING) MAN 2: Good luck out there! (SINGING) Let me hear you whisper That you love me too Keep the love-light glowing in your eyes so true JOE : Let's go, let's go! Come on, I got you. - LANEY : You guys okay? - LEO : Yeah. SENATOR ROAN : Thank you. Again. LANEY : Where we headed? Drive. Out of this city. Get us out of here. (BREATHING DEEPLY) You okay, Senator? No, Marcos. I'm not. This night corrupts everyone. - Senator. - I can't win like this. It goes against everything that I believe in. We need to focus on one thing right now and that's survival. I need to make sure you get through this night. I have to stop them from killing the Minister. What? If they assassinate him, he becomes a martyr. We lose. Yeah. And how do we do that? I don't know. We have to do something. Do what? Do what? You're willing to risk your life to save an assassin... (THUDDING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (LEO GROANS) (PANTING) (GRUNTING) LEO : Everybody all right? LANEY : Joe, you okay? JOE : (GROANING) I'll be okay. SENATOR ROAN : Leo! LEO : Gun! (GRUNTS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (MAGAZINE CLATTERS) (LANEY GASPING) I know where they're taking her. I know why she's still alive. Where? You find a safe place to hide and you stay there. No. No way. Whatever it is you plan on doing, we're coming with you. Let's go. (SCREAMING) (MUFFLED GRUNTS) (CONTINUES GRUNTING) CHOIR: May the Purge protect us. Keep us pure. Purge and purify. May the Purge cleanse us. Keep us pure. Purge and purify. May the Purge cleanse us. Keep us pure. Purge and purify. Come on, guys, that's enough. We're getting paid to deliver the package, not gift-wrap it. Come on, let's go find a place to wait out the rest of this fucking night, huh. (MUFFLED MOANS) MINISTER OWENS : As we always do. ALL : Blessed be the New Founding Fathers for letting us Purge and cleanse our souls. Blessed be America, a nation reborn. Well, it's been a long journey to get away from the lies and the self-deception to this place of knowledge and awareness of who we really are. People of flesh, immensely flawed. It's hard to see the ugly truth. But change can only come from acceptance. And change we must, as it is our godly duty to get rid of the fury and the hatred that poisons our souls, makes us sick. Makes us ugly. Tonight, we, the leaders of this great country, will sin, scour, sanitize and sterilize our souls until we are free again, and this country will be better for it. We are not hypocrites! We practice what we preach. Purge and purify! Say it with me. ALL : Purge and purify! Purge and purify! Purge and purify! Purge and purify! Purge and purify! Let us begin. All right, look, it's after midnight. We need to move. I need a four-man team in there. I need three with me. Got it? Go! LEO : Bishop! Bishop! Bishop! Bishop! I'm unarmed. How well do you know this Dante? Not well. So keep your eye on him. JOE : Our boy is gonna get himself killed. LEO : I'm unarmed. You know this lunatic, Dante? Yeah. I do. Guns down. What the hell are you doing here? Trying to get yourself killed? Is that the tunnel for the cathedral? How the fuck do you know about the tunnel? I asked you a question. This is no longer an assassination. This is a rescue mission. MINISTER OWENS : Jesus died for their sins. (MUMBLING) And now, our modern-day martyrs will die for our trespasses. Our martyr's name is Lawrence. A lifelong drug addict. He wants to make amends. He wants to serve his God and his government. Let's thank Lawrence for his gift. ALL : Thank you, Lawrence. - Thank you for your gift, Lawrence. - Thank you very much, Lawrence. We love you, Lawrence. (SHUDDERING) These weapons have been cleansed with holy water, and they are now instruments of destruction. (GRUNTING) Fuck! You all know the loyal Harmon James. Worked with the NFFA tirelessly for many years. Harmon will be the first Purger of the evening. LAWRENCE: I'm sorry. No, no, no. Please, please, please, please. No, no, no. Please, no, no! I'm sorry! No, please! No! I'm sorry! Please, no, no! Please, no! Please! No! Please, please! - I'm sorry! - Release, Harmon. No! SENATOR ROAN : No! (SQUELCHING) Release the violence from your darkened heart! Scour your soul. Let the light in. You are blood-baptized. And you are born again! (BOTH GASPING) His light entered your heart, Harmon. Yeah. (LAUGHS) The power of Purging! ALL : Purge and purify! Purge and purify! Purge and purify! Purge and purify! Purge and purify! Purge and purify! JOE : Psst. No matter what happens, we stay together. All right, this takes us to the mechanical room. From there, we can access the cathedral. (GRUNTS) Stay there. Where do we go? The church is above us. So are 50 Secret Service agents. You're gonna take the staircase to the balcony. Me and my guys, we're gonna enter from behind the altar and this side here. Okay, good. Let's go get our girl, yeah? Before we get to our communal Purge, the Holy Horde of Many Martyrs, I'd like to introduce a guest who's going to be the centerpiece of a very special Purge ceremony tonight. This person has threatened to dismantle everything that we, New Founding Fathers, have done. We must rid ourselves of the negative emotions that she has stirred inside. We must stop her from poisoning our great country by taking away our freedoms. - Yes! - (APPLAUSE) I would like all the Founding Fathers to come to the altar. Join me, brothers, as we eliminate evil and Purge as one. (SINGING) There is a fountain filled with blood Drawn from Immanuel's veins And sinners, plunged beneath that flood Lose all their guilty stains (SINGING CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) Lord of Air, Lord of Earth, we ask that you receive this child into your loving arms. We are sinners. Let us release. Caleb, our leader, I invite you, sir, to lead us in this Purging as you have and as you will. Blessed be our New Founding Fathers for letting us Purge. (BOTH GRUNTING) Blessed be America, a nation reborn. Rifle! - (ALL SCREAMING) - (GUNSHOTS FIRING) She's alive. Down! (GUNFIRE STOPS) BISHOP : Where you all at? The hell are you all doing up there? Bring your asses down here. (LAUGHING) My negro. Let's go. - Thank you. - MAN : I got you. I got you. Hi. - You okay? - Yeah. Thank you. Again. (GUNSHOTS) What was that? My men taking care of business. Go cover me. We're headed out. Back exit. We have her. MAN : And we have him. Move. Hey! - SENATOR ROAN : Listen to me. - BISHOP : Get off of me. - Mr. Bishop. Please. - LEO : Watch our backs. Just take a second and listen to me. - BISHOP : It's on our way to the exit. - I can win without this. - SENATOR ROAN : Please! - Cover our backs. BISHOP : You will win. I'm gonna make sure that happens. - Open up! - Stop. This is murder. If you do this, you will be no different than them. Get her. LEO : Nope! Don't. Listen to her. She knows what she's doing. We don't need to do this. MAN : Hang on, Dante. Get the fuck out of my way. Wait, please! (PANTING) Don't do this. If you do this, you will be no different than them. We can't be like them. Look at me. (SOFTLY) Purge, my son. Purge. It's your right as an American. Kill me. Kill me. Purge. You're a son of God. - God wants you to Purge. - Shut the fuck up! Coward. Purge! Do it! Do it! Yes! Yes! Kill me! Now, I'm gonna tell you right now, I like black people, but I ain't gonna let you all shoot these white folks. These are our white people. Okay? So, let's put 'em down. (SHUDDERING) You better fucking win. Go. Go. Move! Oh, my God. You murderous pig. I am gonna beat the shit out of you on election day. I'm not as politically correct as the Senator. (GRUNTING) (GROANING) Good night, blue cheese. Well played, Leo. Thanks, Joe. Come on, man. - No, I'm not gonna hurt you. - (MUFFLED MOANING) We have to get you out of there. - BISHOP : Stay here, we'll find a vehicle. - SENATOR ROAN : What about these people? Back, back, back! Get back! - LEO : You got this. - You know I got this. - How bad is it? - Not good. Look, I got one more move in me. Cover me. Go! (SCREECHING) (EXCLAIMING) Shh! Be quiet! Shut him up before he draws the wrong kind of attention. (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) You motherfucker! (GRUNTING) Get up. (GRUNTS) Motherfucker. - Okay. No, it's okay. You're safe. - Thank you. I gotta get the fuck outta here! Let me out! Let me out! SENATOR ROAN : Stop him! (GRUNTS) (GUN COCKING) (GROANS) Joe! Joe? You're gonna be okay, Joe. Come on. We gotta get you somewhere, okay? You're gonna be okay. I promise you. There's nowhere to take me. You're gonna be fine. That's what's important. She's gonna make sure of it. Right, Senator? Yeah. You got this. I got this. (GASPS) Marcos... MARCOS : Joe, Joe, Joe. Breathe, Joe, breathe. (SOBBING) No. LANEY : Wake up, Joe. Wake up! (SOBBING) Joe! MALE REPORTER : That was Senator Roan this morning, casting the first vote of the day. It's been a great day for the senator so far, having already won New York, California, and... Wait, hold on, I am getting word, right now, that the Senator has also taken Florida, which puts her well over the 270 electoral votes for the win. So that is it. It is now official, the next President of the United States will be Charlie Roan. And President-elect Roan has already stated that her first order of business will be taking executive action to put an end to the Purge. LANEY : Updates? It's a landslide. All right, I'll come by tomorrow. We can get started on the ceiling. Sounds good. This place is really coming along, Marcos. Joe would be really happy. I'll catch you later, kid. MALE REPORTER : We're just now hearing reports about a few scattered incidents around the country where NFFA supporters are reacting violently to this defeat. They are burning cars, breaking windows, looting, attacking police officers... (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
