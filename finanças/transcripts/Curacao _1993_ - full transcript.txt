[Screaming] [Metal wrenching] [Men yelling] [Football commentary over radio] (Woman) Stephen? I'm trying to sleep. Oh, you wore me out. Sorry. [Man speaking foreign language] [Replies in foreign language] (Man) ...A sodding tourist a bit like yourself. There is a circling of sharks. The bloody sharks. And they were bucking right down to the shore. If you're very lucky, you can see the feeding frenzy. One starts to bleed. The rest will turn cannibal and shred him in minutes. The sea goes all coppery and churning. You don't ever want to be out in a small boat when that happens. [Chuckles] Grand sight, though. [Laughs] I wouldn't doubt it. I'm sure it is. Well, you'll have to excuse me. No, hold on, no. I had this friend, you see. I must tell you about him. Ah, his life went all to hell. Well, he wrote this little note, you see, telling everybody he didn't blame them, which really means, "I hope "that your bloody intestines fall out and are eaten by dogs." [Laughs] And then he sailed this little boat of his around to the place I've been telling you about. They'd been feeding the monsters. The sea was all...Roiling. And then he opened a vein just here. Sort of an incentive for the bastards, kind of like an hors d'oeuvre. Well, you'll have to excuse me. I've got to meet my wife. She's shopping. At midnight? Oh, my wife, she shops all the time. Well, you come back. You're the sort we like here: A listener. Hey! Oh, uh, terribly sorry. I--i didn't see it. Well, next time. [Laughs] Why don't you just change the sign, Cornelius? "No bloody tourists." Well, I enjoy chewing one up now and then, especially during karnaval time. Stephen, do you want to drive up to westpunt with me? I have to bring back my boy. What's he doing there at this hour? The restaurant closes at 6:30. A woman. What else? Davy, my jan got a pretty little tourist up at westpunt? He don't tell me. I'll pass. Every time we go up there fishing, I'm reminded how small this island really is. A bit of the old exile blues. Think of the thousands who pay to visit this little island paradise. They have a choice. Why don't you just leave, Stephen? I mean, I'd miss you, but... You know I can't. How would I? You've never said. Why don't you go? You know I can't. How would I? You've never said. [Laughs] Great basis for a friendship. Some ought to try. Again? Mmm. I can tolerate any view of myself except seedy. What about the beautiful yankee girl? She's up in my apartment. Wants to take me home to Philadelphia, be her pet. Sounds bloody perfect to me. Wouldn't be right. Right? What the hell does that mean? It means I don't love her. Ach! Who knows what that is? Will you ever love anyone? Maybe. I don't know. Well, it sounds to me as if you're here for the long pull, Stephen. And you best make your peace with it. Maybe I'll get a dog.

I don't even have a job. I mean, who am I supposed to be protecting here anyway? You want to tell me? I'm sorry if you're bored. But you're still going to have to toe the line. Or what? You'll take away the key to the executive bathroom? And one more thing! Since you are, at least putatively, state, I suggest you wear a coat and tie while you're working. No. I beg your pardon? No, I'm not going to stay away from wettering. [Door slams] Thunder all. I thought we did more business last night. Let's take a trip. Huh? That boat out there. (Cornelius) ship.

If you really want to make me happy, California. I've been to those places. Well, send me, then, just for a little while. Stephen was in last night, complaining. You two must be the only people in the antilles who aren't happy being here. He's weird, you know. He's my friend, boy. Well, you better think twice about that one, because there's all kinds of rumors about him. In a tight little place like this, gossip can be dangerous to US. You understand? Best to steer clear of it. I was only doing it for you. Thank you. I'm going to do the vegetable shopping and then stop at the bank. Stay in the bar, will you? Do I have a choice?

Refugees from Indonesia, an unhappy minority in the Netherlands. They occasionally blow things up. Only god knows what they want. Well, there may be some of our people in there. I want to help with this. I think we can handle it without the u.S. Marines. Extra police are arriving from Aruba. They'll put an end to it quickly. Quickly usually gets a lot of people killed. Objection duly noted, Mr. Guerin! Now please leave, or I will put you under arrest. [Gunfire] [Yelling in foreign language] What do they want? What every terrorist wants: To be famous for a few hours. God help US. Not likely. He's frightened now. [Chuckles] I know what that is. God in Christ, I know. You're afraid now. And I'm not. Ever shot anyone? You didn't do those out there. It was your boss did that, huh? You're young. You could still have a life... If you don't kill anyone. I've had my share of dying. Stop. You can see it in my eyes, can't you? I'll kill you. You'd be doing me a favor. Maybe too late. This close, I'd probably take you with me. Give it up, son. No! [Gunshot] Get out the back!

King of karnaval. You know what happens to him. Gets himself fucking sacrificed afterwards. He plows the queen or a maiden or someone. They go to the harvest. And then they cut off his balls and pickle them. And then all the women chop him all up so as his blood runs into the earth and makes it fertile. God, I am drunk. Perhaps a beer to taper off. Is that what you meant when you said you were a dead man? When did I say that? Ach! What I meant was dead broke. All this celebrating. You should see the place. Bloody ruined. I can imagine. About 12 hours ago, you told everybody to belly up on the house. I killed one of them, you know. Younger than my jan, he was. A lot of people are killed by kids today. Still, I had a gun. I could have stopped him with my hands, with either hand. I wasn't there, but you must have had a reason. You wouldn't have done it out of panic. Thank god you don't know me, Stephen. You must have saved 20 lives, Cornelius. Not enough. I don't know what you're talking about, but you better sleep here tonight. I thought it was finished. And the terrible thing is, when they were carrying me the hell all over town, I discovered I still love life. And I was afraid again. Cornelius. [Bird squawking] (Woman) Boring. Reminds me of home. I go to parties this boring all the time at home. We're in the Caribbean. Don't you know any pirates or dope smugglers? I made the mistake of telling my boss I didn't have enough to do. What are you doing? I'm guarding him. Which is nuts, because the bank robbery the other day was the first crime in curacao in 20 years with the exception of a stolen camera or two. Your friend who caught the robbers, Cornelius. Why don't you take me to his bar? You wouldn't like it. How would you know? I might. Do you ever refer to your hometown as "Philly"? Of course not. I rest my case. I hate being patronized. Good afternoon, Stephen. Masoud. (Man) Stephen. I'm sorry to intrude, but I didn't want to leave the boat before I met your beautiful companion. Diana waterman, this is the South African consul general, friedrich low. (Low) I'm delighted to meet you, miss waterman. I like his manner, Stephen. My mother's family were from Vienna. I wouldn't brag about that in Johannesburg, Freddy. It sounds way too Cosmopolitan and just a little Jewish. Oh, Stephen is very hard on me, miss waterman. But it's because I represent the republic. Even now, when my poor country is making such great progress. Stephen is very hard on everyone. Oh, I know. And he claims to be a terrible cynic. But I suspect you have considerable influence over him, miss waterman. If you could make our mutual friend here more accepting of my country... We need more friends like him. Good day. Good day.

Wettering? He claims he was born in Australia of a Dutch father. That apparently is the only honest word he's spoken since he came here. We put him in the computer at Langley. Should have something back tonight. I'll be sticking around a few days. I want you to stay on guerin. I don't care if he knows. Call me. It doesn't matter what time. People who are made angry by the presence of a policeman interest me. Perhaps you've heard of my friend's legendary intemperance, sergeant, but not of his exaggerated sense of pride. He hates to have people see him when he's sick. You're not my bloody lawyer. I'm not sick; I'm drunk. Three days now. And you haven't been out of your apartment in that time, particularly two nights ago? No. Can you give proof? No. This man was murdered two nights ago. About 1:00 A.M. He was registered as Joshua mepinyana from Kenya. But his papers were taken. Do you know this man? (Cornelius) why should I? We were hoping you might. This was found in his bed-table drawer. Maybe the man admired courage. You are a consular officer, Mr. Guerin, so I suppose I should be tolerant of you. I didn't know the man. I wonder if you would mind coming to my office, heer wettering. We might inquire into this affair in some more detail. When did you say this murder occurred, sergeant? Approximately 1:00 A.M. Wednesday morning. Oh. I was drinking with Cornelius until well after 2:00 A.M. Wednesday. And why did you not say so earlier? I didn't know where you were going with this thing. Thank you for the tea, heer wettering. How did he die, this man? He was garroted. We haven't found the murder weapon. But it cut so deeply into the flesh, it almost severed the neck. We believe it was applied slowly. A very cruel death. All right, who is this guy? I didn't kill him. Come on, god damn it. You owe me this. I didn't ask you to make a fool of yourself. Tell them you were confused. Your watch was broken or something. I wouldn't have thought you could be this much of a coward. Get out of here, would you, before I put you out myself. Oh, you couldn't even manage that without your little gun. Hi, sweetheart. Not tonight. Stephen, come in. What is this, Freddy? Love or politics? I'm grateful for your coming here, Mr. Guerin. Stephen, this is Dr. Karl seemueller. May I offer you some tea? Friedrich, wait for US outside. You a medical doctor? Of philosophy only, I'm afraid. Economics, the gray science. You get gray by mixing black and white, don't you? That would seem a rather inappropriate science where you come from. [Laughs] You have wit. That's comparatively unknown in our profession. What is "our" profession, doctor? You work for the department of state, and I work for the ministry of foreign affairs. I'm not, and you're not, and we both know it. Well, what do you think I do? South African bureau of state security. You're a b.O.S.S. Agent. B.o.s.s. Isn't called that anymore. It's the national intelligence service now. Well, b.O.S.S. Suits you. We want to recruit you. Why? You're an experienced operative. Competent. Extensive contacts in Western Europe. What makes you think I'd work for you? [Laughs] My friend, you killed a fellow agent in the American service. That's not nice. He was a traitor. I made a decision in the field. Unfortunately, your service didn't see it like that. And this factor's come to dominate your life. Or should I say the absence of one? And you cannot afford, heer guerin, to be contemptuous of anyone who offers you an alternative, even the devil. If all this is true, why am I still in government service? You're an exile. They've eliminated every record that you even exist, much less earned a living for the last 15 years. Even your social security card has been expunged. You cannot gain employment. You're their prisoner. You know a lot. You'll consider our offer? Of course I'll consider it. I'd like to get out of here without getting mugged. For your trouble. What is it you really want? I'm being perfectly frank with you, Mr. Guerin. Now, please, take it. Keep it. And that black thug out there? I don't want him tailing me. His name's merton. Catch him if you can, Mr. Guerin. But I warn you, don't discount him. Jesus. Sorry, mate. I thought you were someone else. What are you doing here? I'm glad you're home. Good. 'Cause all of a sudden, I'm in a shitload of trouble, and I don't know why, but I think you do. What do you mean? Ever since the bank, I've felt it, the air getting thick. And tonight some South African spook tried to recruit me to spy for him. All right, I'll tell you, but you've got to help me. Not likely. Someone's got hold of jan, someone from the past. They'll kill him. So call a cop. I can't. Well, they must want something, then. Give it to them. I can't do that. Neither can jan. Although he must have thought that he could. He's so desperate to get away, you see. What are you saying? He'd sell out his own father? Where is he? Freighter in the harbor. They telephoned this afternoon. I wouldn't talk to them, but, unfortunately, jan did. And then I became concerned, and I followed him. It was the bloody bank, you see. My damn picture went all over the world. Who are the players? A couple of hot-shot boys from Hong Kong. The hsung brothers. They don't look like much, but you know how the Chinese feel about family. Well, these two murdered their younger brother, and all he did was Nick a few Bob from the company. Yeah, go on. I need you to help me save jan. What have I got to do with it? I didn't mean for it to happen, Stephen, but the cesspool overflowed, and your shoes just happened to be right next to mine. [Sighs] My life was already screwed up. Now you're telling me that I'm sucked into all this just because I'm your friend? The only one I have. Let's go. Thank you, Stephen. (Stephen) there's no sign of the crew. I know. It's wrong. Is it a trap, do you think? I don't know. Huh? [Pounding] He was terrified. Let's try this way. Holy mother of Christ. He was just a spoiled lad. It's leather, same as the Kenyan in the morgue photo. When they poured the water on him, it shrunk and tightened. Let's get him out of here. No. We won't get out ourselves. He's your son, for Christ's sake. He was not my son. He was my... Fancy boy. Well, I don't give a shit about that. We're not going to leave him here. He's dead; He had no family. [Gunshot] Ah! S-Stephen. [Breathing heavily] I'm sor-sorry. Look; You better tell me what the hell is going on now, because I'm in this thing up to my goddamn eyeballs. Three people have been killed. All right. Get me a drink. I'll tell you. The hsungs own ships. Some years ago, I captained an old tanker for them. The prince of Malta. Yeah. We ran oil to South Africa from the Gulf. There was a u.N. Embargo at the time, of course, but all it means to them is more profit. We're dodging missiles and gunboats from the Iranians, but... These bastards, they don't give a shit. Anyway, they call me in. A little favor, they want. They'll pay me a bloody fortune if I sink the prince. Insurance. It happens more than we know. People have made millions and millions of dollars, Stephen. And there's no crime one can't buy for millions of dollars. I imagine they got you for a little less. Well, it was for my retirement, you see. Last chance, at my age. Hell, I didn't know anything about explosives. They had to show me how to set the timer and where to place the charge. We were running south to Cape Town, where we were supposed to deliver our cargo. (Stephen) The crew must have known something. (Cornelius) Half of them couldn't even read or write, let alone speak English. (Stephen) What about the mate? (Cornelius) Joshua. He was a canny one. I swear to you, he knew something. Somehow, he knew. That was your conscience. No, no, it was more than that. Anyway, I started to bring her in close so the crew would have an easy row in. What happened? They told me that it was a wee, small charge. Let the sea in slowly, and everybody into the boats. It was a bloody atom bomb! No boats, no time, everybody blasted into the sea. The explosion, the flames, screams. You could smell the burning flesh. And the sharks. I can still hear it. I shut my eyes; I can see it. Jesus, god. And you were the only survivor. I thought so then. Until I saw the mate. 36 men. Stephen, they swore to me that no one would be hurt. They weren't having witnesses. Scared to death the South Africans would find them out. You've got something, don't you? That's why they're all here. The ship's log. Inside is a bill of lading for the cargo we sold secretly in mombasa. Anybody would know from that. Give it to them. I can't; They'd kill me the minute they had it. Would that be worse? [Thunder rumbles] [Whispers] Stephen. Stephen. Shh. Espresso, three sugars. You remembered. Of course. We lost you for part of last night. Where were you? Choir practice. I heard you were posted station chief in San Juan. Not bad for a lady of color. Why did they send you? Why are you talking to the South Africans? Breaks the monotony. What does seemueller want? Me. What'd you say? No. Don't you think you ought to ask Langley first what they want? I don't care what they want. Yes, you do. You don't have any other choice. [Chuckles] You enjoy this, being my keeper? It just happened to fall under my responsibilities. I don't think we should let it get too personal. No. Not this time. I'll have the information from Langley this evening. Why don't you stop by? Hotel carib, around 7:00? Or call. I'd rather you tell me to my face. Davy, give this to Stephen tomorrow. Not before. It's important. You are not coming back tonight, boss? It's karnaval. I know. Hey, Cornelius! Good luck with the fishing! [Yells back in foreign language] [Laughs] Just in from Langley. They want him to go over to the South Africans. How's he going to take it? I'll find out. Show him in as you leave. [Telephone ringing] She's all yours. This is very nice. Kgb used to have perks like this. Remember them? Sit down, Stephen. You're all gussied up. I'm dressing for success.

They're offering you a new life. They're calling you back. This is what you always wanted. Simple as that? I'm rehabilitated. Didn't anyone tell you people the cold war's over? Well, look, there are always old enemies and some new ones. It's an important part of the world. We don't have any assets in their service. That's all. That's all? You know, I look at you. Is it possible that we ever had anything? Please don't. Okay, forget that. But I got you out of Cuba 24 hours before a firing squad. Shouldn't that count for something? You were doing your duty, Stephen. God, you're cold. You killed another agent. It isn't my fault. Julia, you were out there with US. You know that Sandy sold US out. If I hadn't have killed him, we'd have all gone down, dead or in somebody's gulag. You were a witness. You didn't even come to the company trial, for Christ's sake. Because they had already decided you were guilty, and you know it. Look, what do you want from me? I wanted you to put me before your career. I'm sorry. I know what you went through. Really? You know, they didn't know what to do with me for a while after the conviction. Till they dreamed up this deal. So they put me in that bin they got out on the chesapeake where they keep the loonies and the burnout cases. I didn't know that. I'm sorry. How could you not know that? For the same reason I wasn't at your trial, Stephen: They sent me back into Cuba. Noble. You didn't have to go. I'm Cuban. You know what that regime did to my family. They killed my father. For three days, I saw them torture him. He didn't speak. That's why I joined the service. I've been fighting them my whole life. I didn't know that. Would it have made any difference? No. You've always been so honest, Stephen, so righteous. [Festive music] ♪ ♪ Stephen? Don't do it. Tell them no. The South Africans are killers.

But he don't want anyone ever to know. Any sailor who comes in here, he give them money too. Well, congratulations, Davy. Cornelius left you the restaurant. Me? No. What about jan? Forget jan. He's run off somewhere. He left me the southern cross. Oh, Stephen. He knows how you love that little boat. Davy. If Cornelius wanted to hide something somewhere, where would he put it? Not in the apartment. Jan stole everything. Anyplace else? The boat. That murdered man, the Kenyan, do you think wettering was telling the truth about not knowing him? There's no longer a need to protect him, Mr. Guerin. He is dead. Is there anything you want to tell me, Mr. Guerin? Yeah. I got an idea. Why don't you help me sail the southern cross back to willemstad? [Chuckles] I think the sea air might clear your head. No, thank you. In spite of being a dutchman, I have no stomach for the sea. Good luck, Mr. Guerin. [Squawking] [Suspenseful music] [Speaks in foreign language] Mr. Guerin. Mr. Guerin, please. We would like to talk to you. I'm worthy hsung. And my brother Harold. Please, get in. [Laughs] Who told you I was stupid? Get in! What are you doing? Are you mad? People will see. Harold! Why would we harm you? You're a poor man with something. We are the rich men who want it. Should this not be a happy occasion? Okay, look, here's the deal. Your pals stay here. You meet me at the end of the dock... By yourself. Okay. [Both speaking in foreign language] Mr. Guerin, where are the ship's papers? Please. How would I know? Captain Van belkin. The late Mr. Wettering informed US. He told you I had them? Well, perhaps he wished to see you made wealthy. Yeah. I bet the insurers of the prince of Malta might pay a little something for them. What do you think? In that case, we would have to kill you. I risk that either way. Might as well cut the best deal I can. Very practical, Mr. Guerin. Very Chinese. Is that supposed to be a compliment? I want £100,000. We accept this as reasonable. And I choose the time and the place of the transfer, which won't be easy either, since that son of a bitch seemueller wants a piece of me too. How is it you know heer seemueller? How do you think? He wants you and your brother back in Pretoria so he can hang you both in the basement. That's his man over there. Perhaps you will help US to kill him first. You're quite a bunch. Who are you going to find to kill me after I help you kill him? You just get the money together. You disappoint me, Mr. Guerin. We hsungs are honorable men. Sure, you are. You think you can trust heer seemueller more? He's the one who instigated our plan. He received $10 million for it. Now he's afraid of his own government and wants to kill US. He would kill anyone who knows about the prince of Malta, including you, Mr. Guerin. Good day. Tell Langley I'm not going to do it. Tell them I freaked. Tell them guerin finally went native, like Cornelius. Only Cornelius didn't have the guts to deal with it, and I'm the only one left. It's not so bad, though. I finally found something to care about like you care about Cuba. What are you talking about? Justice... For 36 dead sailors on the prince of Malta. I don't get it. I really don't. I mean, you didn't even know those people. Seemueller was part of the plot. He got rich off those corpses. Oh, god. So you're going to make them all pay... By yourself. How can you? I'm going to let the wolves eat each other. Stephen, the service will not forgive you. I know. [Phone rings on other end] (Man) yes. Worthy hsung, please. Hello, this is hsung. It's guerin. Be at the land house Van burker at exactly midnight, and you'll get the ship's papers. Land house Van burker, how do I get there? Look on your tourist map. I'll be there. And you better keep an eye out for seemueller. He's been on me all day. Very well, Mr. Guerin. [Phone dial ratcheting] [Phone rings on other end] Click Dr. Seemueller? (Seemueller) yes. If you want the hsungs, they'll be at the land house Van burker at exactly midnight. And they'll probably be armed. You, go around back. Come on. [Speaking in foreign language] [Gun cocks] [Rustling] Harold. [Speaking in foreign language] Come on, seemueller. Where the hell are you? [Gunfire] [Dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [Gunfire] ♪ ♪ (Seemueller) come in, Mr. Guerin. Put the gun on the floor. I'm on your side, doctor. So you say. The gun. Now, I'd like to thank you, Mr. Guerin, for arranging this little meeting. He betrayed his own country. [Gunfire] (Seemueller) shut up, you foul little monkey. You didn't do all this killing by yourself, did you? [Laughs] Yes. You underestimate me, Mr. Guerin. Where's your, uh... African friend? I don't need any black to help me kill you. You see, US afrikaners are very efficient peop-- [gunshot] [Gunfire] [Cord swooshes] [Grunting] [Gunshots] [Coughs] I thought you'd left. I never killed a man before. All this for a dead friend. He's not dead. He led me here. God damn it, Cornelius. 36 dead men. Go ahead; Run away from this, you bastard. [Calypso music] ♪ ♪ Where are you going? London's a good town. Can always find something to do in a good town. You don't have any papers. Did you forget my training? What about the local police? A few questions. People disappear down here all the time. I sent the ship's papers to the insurers. You know, the company's severing all connections with you. Pension, ancillary employment, references. You know the drill. Come with me. It wouldn't work. It might. This is my aunt Renata in Miami. Kind of a personal drop, but please don't use it till we're both very old. You're the only part I regret. [Telephone ringing] Yeah. What do you want? No, I'm leaving on the night flight. [Door shuts] All right. I'll come. (Cornelius) are you going to kill me, Stephen? Why? You're already in hell. Hmm. So I am. They all know me here. But they're good boys. They won't give me away. I'll get off soon. Why are you hiding? Everybody's dead. Someone will always know. You, for instance. I wouldn't be surprised if you hadn't already sent the bloody papers to Lloyd's of London. [Laughs] A man like you would have to do the right thing. The tropics don't turn out any michelangelos or Cadillacs, but they can do a good beer. Why are we here? We were buddies, weren't we? Tie it off proper. You ran away, left it all for me. Your crimes, your crap. How does that make US buddies? You had the courage, Stephen. I didn't. You had it at the bank. Oh, well, I was-- I was on show. Don't you see? Blood running high, no time to think. I'm like that. But once I saw jan... I never meant for you to be hurt, Stephen. I hope you know that. We used to come down here to go fishing. Do you remember? I remember a lot. [Sighs] If you're wondering why... I can go on living, I wonder myself. See, I don't believe in god or retribution, any of that now. It's all right here, down here on this lovely earth. But every time I get set to pay, I remember how the southern cross looks like from the deck of a ship. On the midnight watch. The sound of the engines. Warm night. The sea slipping by. And the great silence. And then I'm a coward again. Good-bye, Cornelius. Stephen? If you could. You know, I don't believe in much either. I guess friendship's about it. Good-bye, Stephen.
