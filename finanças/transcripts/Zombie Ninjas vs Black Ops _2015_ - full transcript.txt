[foreboding music] - [VOICEOVER] This isn't how it was supposed to turn out. We didn't see the harm. They were already dead! [screaming] [snarling] [people screaming] - Come on quick. We've got to get ready. We got to run. Let's go! Come on! [guttural growling] I'm armed! [guttural screaming] [foreboding music] Who's up here? [dramatic music] Stay back! Stay back! [guttural snarling] Get back! [gunshots] Get back! [grunting] [dramatic music] [sobbing] - Oh fuck! [guttural snarling] Fuck! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Shit! What the fuck is this doing on Calbridge? - What are we gonna do now? - Come on. Torch! [helicopter whirring] - [VOICEOVER] Saisei Security is renowned for revolutionary armed forces, essential in the elimination of worldwide conflict through resolution and protection of the world's most elite. But here at Sansei our crucial research and development division is dedicated to life. At Saisei we flourish at the forefront of uncovering cures for disease and prolonging life. Established by Master Hachiro and originating in the mountains around Japan's Inga Province. - Dillon? I'm Anita Baxter. Thank you for coming in this evening. - It's nice to meet you. It's a little unusual having a job interview at this time. I'm thankful for the opportunity. - Yes, I guess it is somewhat unusual. I've been working with this division for quite some time so I'm used to it. You have to consider the sensitive nature of what we do here. Privacy is essential. - I understand. I'm interested in hearing more. - Right then. Let's get to it, shall we? This way. You've enjoyed a long, successful career with the TIG. What makes you change your focus to private security? - Frankly, ma'am, it's the money. I spent the last 13 years on the job, every call being high risk: armed seizures, terrorist-related operations, chemical and biological outbreaks, bomb threats, all kinds of combat. And all I got to show for it is a 25-year mortgage and a lousy 4 by 2. I wanna protect and serve, I always have. And as cheesy as it may sound to you I wanna put away bad guys. The job satisfaction may give you a temporary warm feeling but it doesn't comfort my family when I'm away on a job. It certainly does not protect them when I'm gone. - That's a very common sentiment, Dillon. Yes, the pay is exceptional, rightfully so. The company realizes the risk operatives are exposed to and compensation has been modeled accordingly. Are you aware of how different an operative role is in the private security sector as opposed to the domestic situations you've experienced within the TIG? - Oh yes, ma'am. I'm combat trained. I served two tours before settling back home with the TIG. Proficient in all weapon systems, close quarter hand to hand. In addition to the training that I received here which included fieldcraft, water-borne operations, tactical intelligence, marksmanship, and even medical technician. I'm ready for any situation you can throw at me, foreign or domestic, here or in an overseas war zone. - Yes, I've got your records here. Impressive. That job you put off the other month with the shopping center hostage situation, blowing the entry point simultaneously and neutralizing the gunman in 12 seconds flat, impressive. - Thank you. Our team is very effective. - Now you do realize we'll have to put you through our own set of tests. [alarms sounding off] - Where the fuck is everyone? Fuck! [snarling] It's okay. The set up was fairly wide. - Help! Can someone... - What the hell are you doing? Do you want them to know where we are? Can't you see there's no one on the streets? There were split connecting sections to any of these buildings, so unless you are packing a base jumping suit we're stuck here! We just have to find a place to hide. Have you forgotten? - I'm sorry. I don't wanna die. - Pull yourself together. We can't stay here. We've got to move. Come on. [snarling] [screaming] [guttural scream] [dramatic music] [screams] - Ready to breach. [dramatic music] Entrance breached. We are go, I repeat, we are go. Moving through the lower level car park. We are live. I repeat, we are now live. Over. [dramatic music] [snarling] [music intensifies] [gunshots] [grunting] [snarling] [screaming] - What the fuck are we up against here? We need more men! - Nu-uh, it's just us. Push on. We stick to the plan. - The bullets went straight through them. How are we supposed to kill them? - Aim for the head. A good head shot will bring them down. - It sounds like it came from in here. - It could've come from any floor. What makes you think it was this one? Let's just head down to the car park and let security handle it. - You need to relax. We're okay. But somebody else could be hurt. You know I got to check this out. Stay with me, you'll be fine. - See? Everything seems fine up here. I suggest we head downstairs. - Okay, we take the other fire escape. - You got to be kidding me. - Afraid of the dark? Didn't your parents ever tell you there was no such thing as the boogey monster? - Very funny. Let's get this over with. - Shh. - My God. Is he dead? - Yeah. He's dead. Remove the shoes. [eerie music] This way. Don't move! Turn around, put your hands up on the wall! High! Okay, you're good. Sorry buddy but we just discovered a body in there. I have to take all precautions. - What happened? Who is it? - I don't know yet. But it seems we got [mumbles] in the building. We just found the security guard's body. Hey, Kevin. You know where the building's telecommunications panel is? - Yeah, yeah. I can take you there. - All right then. [foreboding music] [glass breaking] What the fuck was that! Okay, all right. This way. Slowly. [guttural growling] Everybody back up. Back up. [guttural growling] Kevin, come on! We need to get down! Kevin! Kevin, get back here! - I'm stuck! - Kevin, get back here! Kevin, come on! Kevin, come on! Kevin, no! Get out of the fucking way! Let's go, run! Run, come on! Come here, come on. Come on, let's go, we gotta move, let's go! Come on! Go! Go! Okay, get ready to move, go, go, go! Move! Move! [guttural growling] [gunshots] Go! Go! Go! Move! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Move! Move! [guttural growling] Come on. [gunshots] Anita, come on. Anita, come on! We gotta get out of here. Come on. [growling] Shh. [music intensifies] Okay, all right, we need to go. Understand? [gunshots] [grunting] - Dillon, here! [gunshots] - What the fuck was that! - Holy fuck! Are you okay? - Let's get out of here. - Okay. [dramatic music] - Stop right there motherfuckers! Drop your weapons! - Thank God! - Dillon? - Jesus! Eddie? What the fuck is going on? There's some fucking thing loose in the building! I mean, he's already killed two guys already including the security guard. He's wicked fast. Dodged all my bullets, man. I don't even think it's human. How'd you guys get the call? - There's a mad man running around the building killing people and you wanna know how we got the fucking call? Come on, Dillion. It's little wonder you're not on the fucking team anymore. - Come on, AK. - Shut it, Eddie. I just lost two guys downstairs. This is a little more than some mad man with a screw loose. - How can that be? He's been up here stalking us the whole time! - I got my orders, Dillon. You don't need to worry about it anymore. - What are your orders? Eddie, what the fuck is going on? - There's been some sort of outbreak, man. Like an experiment gone wrong. We're here to contain the situation. - That's enough, Eddie. - Come on, man. Looks to me like you can use all the help you can get. - Yeah, come on boss. - Okay, okay. We gotta get the research data from the lab, eliminate the threat and witnesses. - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! You hang on a fucking second. Wh-what witnesses? No, no, no! What witnesses? Us? What witnesses? We're innocent victims here! - Yeah, of course. We just need to contain the situation. - Eddie! You've got your fucking orders! What do you think this is? We don't ask questions, we're doing the motherfucking job! Dillon, for old time's sake, if you're with us, you're okay. - Come on, boss. When have we ever killed civilians? I'm not gonna kill her. - I know exactly what's going on here. There's been a breach in the lab. This is clean up. - No! [gunshot] No, no, no! Come on! Anita, come on. [music intensifies] Motherfucker! [both grunting] - Eddie! Take him out! - Can't do it, AK. - Eddie, you've chosen the wrong fucking side! Colt! On two! Cover me! Two! - Eddie, I'm out! - We're low in ammo. It's all we have. - Just like the good old days, huh? - You never had the stomach for the hard jobs, Dillon. - Fuck man! Boss, this is getting really bad. - Shut the fuck up, Colt! If you get in my way I'm gonna take yous out. - Last resort, huh? - Get back! - It's okay, Mali. We're here to help. You're okay. You've done good. Is that the research? Are you Mali Kingston? 8342, Culver Ave, Claire Hill, daughter of Joseph and Carry Kingston? Answer me! - Why don't you lower your gun? - Sorry, Mali. I've got my orders. - You don't know what you're dealing with! [grunting] Get off! Get off! Give me the shot! [gunshot] [guttural growling] Take the shot! Take the shot! - AK, come in. - Fuck's sake! Did you get that? - Can you complete the mission? - You didn't tell me these things are so powerful. They're not human. - Can you complete the mission? - My team's disbanded. Dillon's here. And on the fucking way. I don't know what he's doing here. Eddie's gone with him. You're gonna have to send me more men. - That's a negative. There's no one else. You need to take hold of this situation. Is the physician alive? - It looks dead to me. - The mission's changed, you've got new orders. Our old cost, fanged Mali, take possession of the research, but this time keep her alive, got it? I'll keep the building in lock down but you've got to be quick. Out. - Roger that. - Freeze! - Get back! Don't come near me! Get away from me! Leave me alone! - It's okay. - Please, please don't come near me. Please. Please. - It's okay. It's okay. We're not here to hurt you. - Don't come near me. - We're here to help you. We're not gonna hurt you. - Get back! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! - Shh. Stop, stop, stop, stop. - Don't come near me. - We've probably come across the same guys that you have. You have to be quiet. We're not here to hurt you. We're just trying to survive this. - You can't beat them. Your other guys in there they're dead. We'll be dead too if we hang around here. - Okay. So we can't go up, we can't go in there, and we can't go down that fire escape. - We could try this. I got it off the security guard. The elevators, if they've been out of action, chances are they're clear, right? - That won't work. It's all shut down. - It's worth a shot. It has access to all the secured floors. We'll use the manual override, yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. See you out. - What is it, man? - It's nothing. - Do you think we can ride the top of it? Don't they have manual controls? - No way. I'm not doing that. - Let's see if we can get the other one down first, huh? - Holy cow, it actually worked. [guttural growling] - Go, go, go, go! [gunshots] [dramatic music] How's it looking, Eddie? - This is a dead end! - It looks like there's a way out down here! [guttural growling] Eddie, look out! - Mali, come on. [dramatic music] You all right, Eddie? - Yeah, I'll live. - Come on, Mali, we gotta go. Mali, come on, we gotta go. Mali, come on! Mali, come on! Mali! What are you doing? - We need to know what went wrong. I need his blood work. It's impossible. - What's impossible? - There is no blood. - What do you mean there's no blood? Did you get the vein? - Dillon, I'm a fucking scientist. I do this for a living. He-It has no blood. Nothing, it's bone dry! - So what now? - I'll need to take a tissue sample. The serum wasn't about bringing them back to life. Resurrecting flesh, controlled. - What? I don't understand what you're saying. - Our division was commissioned to research and develop a culture serum that would regenerate in the bloodstream of a dead person: effectively, instant repair of irreparably damaged cells. In fact, bringing them back to life. It's a way of creating a super soldier, I guess. - Bringing back the dead? No shit. - Yeah. But that's not what this is. There is no blood work, there are no vitals. It failed. It didn't bringing these mercenaries back to life. The serum was a flesh activator. They're walking dead. - Fucking zombies? - Because they were mercenaries killed in combat muscle memory has retained their highly trained skills. Not being human they're clearly even more powerful. - Which is why these freaks move like ninjas? It's why they can dodge our bullets? What do we do, Mali? What do they want? - That's just it. They don't actually know what they want. The very nature of a zombie is a body of flesh. The mind controlled independently. - Wait. What do you mean controlled independently? Like some sort of voodoo shit? - Sort of, yeah. - So, you're telling me that someone else is controlling the zombies? - It's my guess. - It's fucking peachy. Are you done? - Come on, let's get out of here. - Let's go. [gunshots] - AK, can you read me? AK, can you read me? AK, can you read me? [gunshots] AK, can you read me? AK, come in. - What the fuck have you got me into? I sent my team in live. You haven't told me the whole fucking story. - Put the camera back on and get on with the fucking task! - Clean up your own fucking mess. I'm done. Out. - Fuck! [snarling] [gunshots] [screaming] [gunshots] - Run! Run! Come on, Eddie, let's go. Eddie, come on. - Dillon, go! - Eddie, come on! - Take her! Go! - Fuck! - Go! - Move, move, move, move! [dramatic music] - Aim for the head. A good head shot will bring him down. [gunshot] [screams] - Hey, it's gonna be okay, Mali. We're gonna find our way out of this. So, what's Saisei really about? Now, this whole super soldier rebirth. How'd you get mixed up in all of this? - This isn't how it was supposed to turn out. - It wasn't supposed to turn out like this for Saisei or for you? - Me. Well, I don't know. I fell in love with a scientist. I was recruited. The physician, he was my mentor. He was such a visionary, think about it. The prospect of regenerating life. I can't believe he's dead. He was a humanitarian who strived to design a way through death. Funding for this sort of research doesn't just fall from trees. He found a wealthy fellow devotee to the cause in Japan. That's how Saisei started. He could undertake his research. He knew the military compromise but he had his eyes on the greater good. Our subjects, our human subjects were mercenaries employed by Saisei that were killed in combat. We didn't see the harm. They were already dead! - Mali, can you tell me what went wrong? - I don't know! That's why we've got to get out of here so I can test my samples. - Is it... Is it infectious? [guttural growling] - What are we gonna do? Help! Is anyone out there? Help! - Mali! Stop! Shh! Mali, there is nobody out there. Okay, all right, I need you to be quiet, okay? I don't wanna leave any more than down here. Do you understand? Mali... Go and hide somewhere. [calm music] [music intensifies] [dramatic music] [calm music] Hey! [music intensifies] [gunshots] [screams] [gunshot] - Stop right there motherfuckers! Mali, I've been looking all over this fucking building for you. Now give me that satchel. - Let her go, AK. - Shut the fuck up, Dillon. - We're walking out of here. [gunshot] Okay, all right. [gagging] [dramatic music] [guttural growling] Mali, the gate! Go, go, go, go! [bomb explodes] - Dillon, we could've used you on our team. - Yeah? What team is that exactly, Hiraldo? - You know how it goes. We've got orders to follow, a job to execute. - I've seen how you execute orders. - Yeah, well this one didn't exactly go as planned, but not all's lost. You're here and she's here. With the research I presume? - Haven't you seen the result of this? It is uncontrollable death! It is not safe in anyone's hands. - That's not your decision to make, young lady. That belongs to your employer. So hand it over, now! - Don't move, Mali! - I don't intend to. [gunshot] [screams] - Dillon! No! Dillon! Does it make sense to you to kill innocent people to bring others back from the dead? - I am not messing about, Mali. [guttural growling] We don't have lots of time. You can't survive this without me. [guttural growling] [gunshot] [dramatic music] Dillon! Dillon! Come on, Dillon. Get up, Dillon. Get up, please. Please, Dillon. - Mali, you got to run. Mali, you got to run. - Please, come on, Dillon. - Mali, you got to run. Mali, you got to run. Run! - Dillon! - Go! Run! Go! [dramatic music] [calm music]
