Oil on Canvas. Hugo! Hey! What are you doing here? Let me have a look at you! Beautiful as always. I’ve missed you so much Hugo So have I. Hello. Hi… I’m Julio. This is Julio. Nice to meet you. Where’s Dad? He went in to town to get some things done. Okay. Well I’m going to finish watering the garden and if you want we can have a swim in the pool later. Sure. Great… See you later. Bye. Thanks. Well, a swim? What you wanted, is that right? :Can I leave my things here? Of course, wherever you want. Julio… make yourself at home. I’ll take this drawer. Sure. Hey, have you seen my swimsuit? I could have sworn I packed it but I can’t find it. Maybe you left it in the car. Yeah. I’m going to go have a look, ok? Yeah, ok. Where are the keys? Hopefully not in the car. I’ll Be back. Ok. Don’t get lost. Are we swimming or not? Yeah, cause the heat is slowly killing me here. Come on let’s go. Go, come on! Jump! No, no, no! Fine. Come here. Did you swallow water? Yes. Julio is this your bag? Yes… Sorry I’ll bring it upstairs. Don’t worry, I can take it your room. Thank you. When you’re done get started on the firewood, we’re celebrating. Yes, I’m on it. Here, store this in the fridge and help your cousin with the firewood. Ok. Dad! Oh Dad! Look how beautiful you are. I didn’t know you’d come with a friend. I know, it was a bit last minute. His name is Julio, he’s my boyfriend. Well, we’ll all have dinner together. Julio. Julio! Julio! Hello. Hi there. Ramon, the fire! Coming! Tough guy. Just plays hard to get. Wait there, I’ll help. Hugo. The water is great. Have you talked to dad? Yes. Really? I’ve also told him I find my cousin sexy and I jerk off every night. Very funny. What did he say to you? Nothing, he wasn’t expecting Julio. He’s so hot. Well… I’ll stick to Ramon. As long as you don’t steal my boyfriend. My life would be easier that way. Hugo... Are you happy? Yes... ...well. I’m the one who had to stay. You know you don’t have to stay. I’ve told to come with me many times. What about dad? Ramon is here. Is that why you stay? Because of Ramon? Don’t be silly! Fine. Well Ramon is hot too. And that wasn’t the worst thing that happened. The worst was that your sister fell in the mud and then the painting did too. Julio! Well, but then I got two weeks to make it again. It wasn’t that bad. Pass me a napkin please. Is there anything left on the grill? A couple of burgers. Could you bring one for me and your cousin? Sure. Not for me. Yes, you’re getting skinnier by the second. Can’t you see I’m eating a lot and I’m not getting skinnier. Go on just eat it honey! Dad, why does it matter if I eat It or not? Go on, give it to your cousin. I’ll eat it. Here you go Arturo. Careful it’s hot. Ramon, you’re staying tonight, right? But there isn’t any room. Of course there is… Ramon you can sleep with Hugo and I’ll crash on the sofa. I don’t think Ana will be too happy with that. Shit, why not? I’ll stay. Can’t let her get used to it. Get used to what? Sleeping with her every night. What’s wrong with that? Women are a bit temperamental, but that’s what men are here for, right? You can say that again. You’re right, thank god we have you men. Are you living in the stone age dad? Are you still carving Stone? Do you really think your only task in life is keeping our pussies warm? Just asking. Maria please. There are things that never change. Yes and it seems there are people that don’t change either even if they live in the same shit as always. Right dad? Do you really think we need a dick to be happy? Well not me. I’m self-sufficient. And I’ll eat a dick if I want to. And I bought a dildo Dad, and I’m so happy. I bet you would like a dildo. What’s a dildo? Nothing dad, it’s… ...a type of paint brush. You know... It’s a thick paint brush. There are big ones and smaller ones… ...fat ones, kind of like this cob. How do you turn a stone wall in to mud? Honey, leave it alone it’s not worth it. When something happens to your students what do you do? I let them fall. Do you help them get up? No. I give them the right tools so they can get up on their own. Yes, but we’re comparing people my age to my father. You see. When a work of art is analyzed, it must be contextualized in its time. Right? Well you’re forgetting the fact your father hasn’t lived in the same time as us. Yeah. Maybe I went too far. You’re probably right. Maybe you did overstep a bit, I don’t know. I know, but it’s hard to come back home and... see that nothing has changed. Maybe I did go a bit too far. Maybe you’re right. Even more knowing my father, I bet he’s really sad. Yeah, I definitely went too far. I think It’s best If I speak to him. I’m going to go talk to him before he goes bed. Oral sex in front of the window. Oil on Canvas. 80 x 80. Well tell him to fuck off. I wish I could. The thing is he likes when I wear it. But how old could it be? 50? Or 100. The worst is how hot it gets, man. Hey, you really don’t want some? I’m good. If you want we can get rid of the overalls and say the dogs did it. That way you don’t have to wear it anymore. What if we toss it in fire ashes? I don´t know... If your Dad asks we’ll just tell him it was him while he was drunk. Yeah, he wouldn’t believe that for a second. True. Listen. I’m going to bed. You coming? Yeah, Me too. I’m so sleepy. What did you dream about? Did you dream? I don’t dream. What? Good morning. Hey. Good timing… Eat something fast, we have to load the van. Is Ana coming today? Now you’ll see how angry she is for staying last night and not telling her. Maria, Could you clean up once you’ve finished? Sure, I’m going to wait for Julio anyways. That should be her. She’s probably furious. So feisty. I want you at the door in five minutes. Ana you don’t have to do that, the boys are inside. Hi Arturo… Look. I’ll stop once I give birth. I have to paint today but we can escape tomorrow. Sure. Leave it here. There’s another box, right? Yes. Perfect. Here Hugo. Hey! Look who got out of bed. Good morning to you too. If your angry with him he’s inside eating his breakfast. Great… help me Hugo! I’ll go once I finish. You’re scared. Shut up girl! You’re scared. Me? Yes. How are things with Ana? With Ana? Good. Yeah? Why do you ask? I don’t know, since she seems to intimidate you. I mean, have you met her? She’s so feisty. It’s just when she gets mad… I don’t know. Why? It drives me crazy. Women are always getting angry, always. Of course. How crazy are women to get mad, right? It just seems to happen. You don’t think so? Me? Oh no of course. Are you getting angry now? You don’t get angry? Yes but not for the same reasons she does. Because we’re women. That’s what usually happens. Everything makes us angry, right? Exactly. I really don’t understand. I don’t get angry about silly things. Do you know what feminism is Ramon? Have you heard of it? Yeah I’ve seen it on the tv. On the TV? And what’s your opinion on it? Well I don’t know, what we see on tv... Women flashing their boobs and things like that. It’s not pretty, not at all. Horrible, that’s just horrible. So you’re not a feminist because you don’t flash your boobs. I’m… I don’t know, but I’m not the opposite. No, of course you’re not. No, I’m not a chauvinist but I’m also not a feminist. What are you? I’m… I’m in the middle. Oh you’re in the middle? Well obviously cause male Chauvinism is for men and feminism is for women. So you’re in the middle. I really don’t understand. All I know is, women flashing boobs… Not for me. That's gross. You, close this fucking door. Look I… See she’s complaining. Get going. I don’t think she’ll stop anytime soon. Be careful. Yes. Middle man, middle man! Gosh... You’re fine. I’ll wait for you here. Hi honey. I don’t want to see your face! Don’t get in the van Ramon. Don’t get in! I’m leaving now. I... I brought you a flower. You brought me a flower? A flower for my flower. A flower!? You left me alone last night when I could have gone in to labor! Anything could have happened and you bring me a flower? You bring me a flower! Look at what I do with your fucking flower! You don’t even have to brain cells to rub together Ramon! Fuck! Get out of the car! Don’t even touch me, we’re both mad! Have you thought about what you want to do with the orchard? I want to sell it Dad doesn’t want to but it’s just a burden. I don’t really care. I don’t think I’ve gone to seen it since mom. Well it’s all Brushwood now. I’m going to open a gallery. What does that have to do with the orchard? A bit of money would help me out. Oh right… Dad’s the problem. I’ll talk to dad. Fine, but he’s not going to like it. I’ll deal with him, I don’t mind. Hey, do you remember when we were little how we would pretend to control the weather? I remember you would always end up crying because your hair got curly. No. And mom would come running and shake you like a washing machine, remember? Hugo I’m reading. And I would sing… How’d it go? “Let it rain, Let it rain... The children are in the cave” Hugo! Hugo I’m watching you. “Yes, no, the rain won’t let me go.” Are you kidding me? Ok, ok, ok, stop! Fine. Did you like that or what? Fuck... Does it suit me? Well it looks better on me. I might keep it. Hugo... Yes? Why don’t you come with us? I can’t. Yes you can. I just think you’re scared. Scared? Scared of what? Being free. At least think about it. Will you? I will. Good morning. More like good afternoon. Have you had breakfast? No... but I’ll just have some cereal. I hate birdseed. What’d he say? That he loves cereal. One second. Fran, hello. Yes, everything is great. Excuse me? Oh... yes. All right. Great tomorrow. Perfect. Alright, bye. Well... That was Fran. Yes. What’d he say? We have a gallery. Really? Seriously? Yes. We have a gallery Julio! I better start packing. Wait a second, come here, come here. Come here a second, sit down. What? Listen to me. Yes. Why don’t I go and you stay here. No. Hugo needs you. Listen to me… Stay with him. I’ll drive up this evening and get everything sorted tomorrow. Ok? Okay.. Fine. Ok? Okay.. Fine. Trust me. It’s been a pleasure. Leaving so soon? Yeah. We have to close the contract for the gallery. So Julio is leaving but I stay a couple more days. I’ll see you soon Hugo, It’s been a pleasure. Same here.. Well I’m off, It’s getting late. Be careful, ok? Yes, I’ll call once I get there. I love you. Love you too. Bye! Hugo! Hugo! Want to do something later? Sure! Hey, Dad said to come up for lunch, Ok? I’ll be right up. Did you hear they opened a sex shop in town. Where Maria used to be. Seriously? Seriously. Have you gone dad? Maria… look what you’ve started. I don’t know, maybe I can take you. You know he likes it. Well we can go, and have a father daughter shopping spree. Maria, stop. I can’t even imagine dad there. Oh Dad, I forgot how good this salad was. Well eat up, cause there’s plenty. Nothing like yours. Well you know dad’s salad is famous in town. That’s true. Hey dad, did you know Maria wants to sell the orchard? What the hell is wrong with you? Weren’t you going to tell him this morning? What’s this? You want to sell it? Sign. Sign what? Since it’s part of your mother’s inheritance. The three of us have to consent to sell it. It’s says all three of us give consent. Sign. Dad, do you really want to sell it? Do you guys actually care about what I want? For fuck’s sake! Ramon! Coming! The hose is on its way! For fuck’s sake! It’s the fact that he thinks my gallery is some dead end dream. He doesn’t know how much it’s cost me. It’s cost a lot of hard work. A lot! And to make things worse. When I told him I want to study arts. He said I have an Uncle with a house painting company. Houses! I make paintings for fuck’s sake. “I don’t think I understand". I think you’ve lost your mind. You’re making fun of me, aren’t you? Nope. I’m not judging your relationship with Siri. I came to apologize for what I said at dinner. It’s fine. You know Dad’s just emotionally blackmailing you. Yeah and its working. Hugo do you.. Do you ever fear… Forgetting mom? Hey... Why don’t we get in our swimsuits... And go to the pool. Things always look a bit different under water. Do I really have to wear these? They’re so old. Must be from the 1800s. That’s what we have. Arturo... Fuck! [Are you ok? I got a bit dizzy. Ok, take it easy. Are you going to the carnival tonight? Well I haven’t asked Ana yet. I’ll ask her later. Are you going? Yes I’ll stop by... not really in the mood though. Hey. Have you told Hugo... About you and Cristina? As if it were that easy. I’ll tell Hugo to come to the carnival too. Take Maria with you. Sure. I’ll tell her. Better? Fantasy. You’re phone? Yes. Yes? Hi... All good? Ok... me too. Bye. Julio? Yes… He just arrived. How lucky you are. And the number of dicks you can have if you come with me. Maria! It’s true. He didn’t hear anything... Really Maria… Shut up! You... and you. We’re going all out tonight! Don’t you think Pineapple on pizza is... the best invention ever. Best one ever. Here you can eat my pineapple all day. You don’t like it? It’s disgusting. People that don’t like pineapple? You don’t like it!? People that like pineapple on their pizza are just strange. What are you talking about? Gross! The whole pizza just taste of pineapple. But that’s what gives it a different taste. Yeah, different. If you want different just order a Barbecue pizza. It’s still different Well, if you don’t want the rest of your pineapple I’m happy to have it. All for you. We still have to wait a while anyways. Gosh. Why do women always take so long to get ready? Well all but Ana, she’s always ready before me. Lucky you Ramon. I guess I am. Let’s see how you get out of this one. Me? I was just telling the truth. Yes it’s true but you know why? You know why Ramon? Not really. Because in this shitty heteropatriarchal society... Women are forced to be beautiful and men to be strong. And to be pretty I have to wear make-up so shut up and wait. Wait, but you put makeup on because you want to? Yes. Well then I don’t understand. I know. Don’t worry. Being a feminist is not a matter of a day. Sure isn’t. How long does it take? Should you explain? I don`t wear make up. Ramon do you want me to put makeup on you? What are you talking about? You’d look amazing. You actually would. Ok you’ve officially lost your mind. How are you going to put makeup on me? Guys don’t wear makeup. Some guys do. Yeah, the clowns at the circus. Maria. Yes. There are a lot of things that I thought you shouldn’t try. Then one day they told me that... I had to try the pizza with pineapple. And I tried it and then look what disgust it gave me. Well it’s the same thing. There are things one should simply not try. Like makeup. You don’t have to try makeup because everyone knows it won’t go well. Sure. There are thing that work out and others that don’t. And even the things you do try could turn out to be bad. Like pineapple on pizza. Very well said. It’s true. If it’s true, it’s true. If it’s true, it’s true. Just like to make things crystal clear and dense as chocolate. Totally. What are you laughing at? Some talents in life. You’re the dense one. Me? And what are you? The special one? Everything was so good. The country side gives us all we need. Why do you always end things the same? Because I have everything I need here. Have you decided what you’re going to do with the orchard? Sell it. My girl needs it. As do you. Stay here and live with me. It would be too abrupt. I haven’t even met Hugo. He’s leaving too. Did he tell you that? No, but he doesn’t need to tell me to know its happening. Why not? It would be fun. You know I adore your house. I’m going to pee my pants, man. How many drinks have you had? Don’t know, One… after another. Yeah, You have no shame. You’re the one who has no shame. Showing your cousin your dick. Yeah me. Unbelievable, Unbelievable. How long have we’ve been waiting here? Half an hour? Half an hour! What if he’s pooing? Well he’s not, he can’t poo. What do you mean he can’t? He can’t poo if isn’t at home. Well maybe he is pooing. What's up honey? You think it’s nice? What? Well we’ve been waiting here for half an hour. I’ve been posing here for half an hour. Yeah we have. Remember the flower incident this morning. But I did that with love. With love? You did that with love? Say that one more time and you won’t know what’s coming for you! Let me tell you something, tonight You’ll stay with your cousins who don’t mind. No, not at all. And I’m going to sleep in calm at home. But why? I want to sleep with you. You want to sleep with me? Yes I adore you. Did you understand? Did you understand or not? Yes, but... But Ana, Ana… Ana what? What about... What about Doctor Ramon tonight? Tonight, Doctor Ramon sleeps alone… For bad behavior. He’s not keeping me happy. I love you, just so you know. Maria call me tomorrow. I’ll call you tomorrow. And let me know if anything happens. Of course. Bye Hugo. Bye Ana. You know I love you! Oh my god, my god! You don’t love me. She doesn’t love me. What if I wear it like this? Maria, pull that up. Oh, she has a secret weapon! You’re just jealous. Me? I‘ll show you my boobs if you want. Alright. They’re so small. Look how small. Hey, at what time does your bus leave tomorrow? Around six... why? What do you mean around six? Its six now. Hugo... are you thinking of coming or what? Maybe. Really? Truly? That’s great, man. Wait, wait… But you’re not going to change your mind last minute are you? I’m still thinking about it. No, I think you’ve already thought about it. Of course he has. He’s completely thought about it. Look, look at what I do. This one is for Hugo. Hugo, I love you man! You’re going to crack your head open. What’s wrong with you? Don’t do those things, we don’t want to lose you. Shut up, at least I tried. What do you mean you tried? Back up. Watch and learn kid. Watch this. Let’s see kid. I won’t watch. I can't, I can`t. Boom! You’re crazy man, crazy. Did you hear the sound you made? POW! It’s all under control! What are you talking about? Good morning... Bet you didn’t know I could do those things. No, of course not. You know what? What? I think Dad should get a girlfriend. What are you laughing at? Me? Yes. Nothing... Just life! He’s gone delusional now. Life is just short man. Look, look. Hey! What are you doing? Have you seen my ass? It’s like bread. Have you seen my ass? It’s like bread. Hey did you know they opened a sex shop? Hey did you know they opened a sex shop? Do they sell dildos? Look! A shooting star! What do you mean? I don’t know, I don’t know. The fact that it has… He hasn’t got a clue. That’s just gross. You just have to feel it. Really feel it. Oh god. I don’t know how to do those things. You have to feel that you really are that. Because if not… I can’t do those things. Where do you even learn to? I don’t know what I'm saying... In the mirror when I can take baths. Do you actually do that shit? That shit? Hey, what if we get in the pool before… before heading upstairs? I can’t, I … No. I’ll…I’ll go with you. Yeah? Yes. Yeah? You’re coming too Maria! Come on! No, no, no. I can’t I’m going to bed. I don't want to. Why not? Cause I’m going to take one of those baths… you know. Ok, tomorrow I’ll go for a swim for sure. I Promise. Be safe, ok? Of course. And don’t make noise. No, no. And you’re both very handsome. Ok? Bye. Goodnight. Come on… Let’s go! I can’t get over it. So, you’re really leaving? I think so. This isn’t the life for you. Go away. You should go, take the chance and go. Do you want me to leave? Hugo... I want you to be happy. This isn’t your place. It’s mine... And... And your fathers. Are you getting in or what? Maria... Maria! Good morning. Can we talk? I signed the paper last night. I knew you would. The memory of your mother is more than some plants. I know. You’ll have to say goodbye to the town, right? Should we tell Hugo? Your brother and cousin are sleeping by the pool. Go on, take a shower. Yes. That would be nice. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Ramon! Good morning princess. Fuck off. I’m kidding Hugo. Hugo... Not a word of this to anyone. Don’t worry. Did you enjoy it? Fuck. Yes but… Well then great! Don’t get worked up. That’s the only thing that matters. What about you? I don’t remember, man. I swear I can’t remember. You’re so stupid. Listen. Friends? Friends. Prick. Idiot. I’m going to go take a shower. Ok dude. I’ll stay here and pick up. Morning honey, how are you? What? Ok, ok, ok, ok. I’m coming. I’m coming Ana! I Love you! HUGO! HUGO! What’s wrong? Ana is in labor! I’m going to be dad! Well, run you bastard!

There aren’t views like this there. But I’m sure they have Churros. Yes, but they’re never as good. You’re taking Hugo with you? Don’t worry. I think its best. I’m sure. I talked to Ramon yesterday, He’s going to buy the orchard. Really? He can’t give me the money at once. But he’ll continue working in the olive trees to be able to pay for it in a few years. I’m so happy. That’s great news! By the way, I know Hugo is... Gay. What do you mean? Maria. He used to ask for dolls when he was 10. Yeah but that doesn’t mean… Maria... He asked for dolls… Yes, I guess you’re right. If he asked for dolls. Hugo, take care of the car. It hast last at least 10 more years. But it’s as old as me. Exactly. I’ll take care of them dad. Remember the papers are up front. Yes. And step hard on the clutch because it’s a bit rusty. Do you have water? Its hot today Maria. Yes dad, we have everything we need. Be careful! Oil on Canvas. That lady looks so familiar but I don’t know why. That’s dad’s girlfriend. Ramon told me. What a bastard… Wow! Maria... I had sex with Ramon last night. Seriously? You’re the worst.
