- By the way, I hope you're free the second week of October. - Three months from now? Why? - Well, I went ahead and booked a hotel room. Uh, a suite actually... A very nice suite for the National Advertiser's Convention in Vegas. - Well, let's see if I can fit you into my social schedule. Considering you're a major part of my social schedule. - It was George Sand who once said, "There is only one happiness in life: To love and be loved." It should come as no surprise that George Sand was actually a woman. I've known for a long time that women feel love much more deeply than men. - Spending time with you and everything, it's... the best I've felt since before Jack died. - Yeah, both of us have had a rough couple of years. - It hasn't been easy. - Yeah, it's weird not hearing from Michelle. Five years of marriage and it's like... We never even met. And, you know, this whole dating thing. - Ah, depressing, really. What little I did of it, I hated. - Well, you have to admit... Occasionally, it pays off. [Sobbing] - I'll never forget the day I lost the only man I ever truly loved. The day Kathryn Brown took him away from me. [Sobbing] - I knew it. I knew it! - [Kathryn]: Why did you let me have that piece of cheesecake? - [Brian]: Ha! Ha! So I wouldn't feel guilty. - [Kathryn]: Thank you for dinner. - Well, thank you for the company. I'll walk you to your car. [Police siren] - I learned long ago that anything worth having is worth fighting for. I couldn't just sit back and watch as Brian was ripped away from me. - Allison! What the hell are you doing here? - You were cheating on me the whole time, weren't you? How is she? - Who? - The woman I saw you with tonight. I saw you with her. - Wait, you followed us? Allison, are you out of your mind? This has nothing to with Kathryn, I didn't even meet her until after we broke up. [She laughs] - I don't believe you. I saw what she was doing! I saw her coming on to you. - What? - Why can't you see? Men just can't see. - That's ridiculous... - No, there are some women who thrive on stealing men away from other women. - That's ridiculous. I didn't leave because Kathryn stole me away from you. I left because of this. Because you're acting insane! You broke into my house for God's sake! - You gave me a key. - Which you gave back. Which means you made a copy. - I just want to talk to you. Because we can work everything out. Come on, Brian, don't give up on us! - Sometimes, people get to know more about each other and it doesn't work out. I... I explained this to you a couple of months ago. - Remember when I told you about my father? You said you couldn't believe that he would walk out on me and my mom. You said that you would never do that! You see, so I can't let you do that to me. - Allison... You and I, we just... can't be together. - Now I know that there are some things that you don't like about me. But I can change. I can change that. You see, I won't be... jealous anymore. And I won't be controlling. - Allison. It's over between us. You have to leave. - No. No, no, no. I just want to talk this through. Come on, come on. Let me just... We can work this out. - There's nothing more to talk about. I'm asking you to leave. - To, to leave? No no no no! You don't understand! No! NO! NO! [Mug breaks] You should be asking me to marry you! - That's it, I'm calling the police. - No no no! Give me the phone! Give me the... [Crying] At first I felt betrayed by Brian. Hurt. Rejected. Hopeless. I couldn't eat, go to work, go out. I couldn't do anything. But the sadness eventually went away. And then I just felt angry. Angry at him. But mostly, angry at the woman who had come between us. Kathryn. It was true, Brian and I had been having some problems. All relationships do. But Kathryn used the opportunity. And that's what they do, women like her. Home wreckers. Mistresses. Whatever you wanna call them. They go for men who belong to someone else. And they steal them. It took me three months, and then I knew. Knew what I had to do. And the key, was Brian's sister. Jordan. [Dialing] [Cell phone ringing] - Hello? - Hello, Jordan? - [Yes.] - Hi, Mary Connor from the Philadelphia Reporter. I spoke to you a couple of weeks ago about doing an interview. [It's for the ecology report I'm doing.] - Right, on the conversation project. - Mhmm, you said you thought you'd be back in Tennessee this week. Do you have an hour or so to meet with me? I could come to your house. - Oh, no, actually, I'm on my way to Charleston for the clean air rally. Charleston, really? Maybe I could go. Where are you staying? - At a hostel near the rally site. I'm only gonna be there overnight but I'm sure that we can find some time to meet. - Oh wait, no, I'm looking at my schedule, and that's not going to work for me. Um, why don't I just call you next week, and we can figure something out then. - Sounds good, thanks Mary. - Thanks. [Knocking] Hi, Becky, come on in. - You must be so excited. What made you decide to go to L.A.? - You know, I've been thinking about it for a long time and, I don't know. The timing just finally seemed right, - Well, lucky you. After meeting with Jack's attorney this morning, it doesn't look like I'll be able to go on a vacation for a long time. - Oh, right. I forgot. So it didn't go well I take it. - He wants to get out of paying alimony and child support. I guess he wants to spend all his money on this new girlfriend. He's being such a jerk! I've pretty much had it with men now. - It's like Brianand that Kathryn woman. You should've seen all the things she did to try to seduce him. It was disgusting. - Wait a sec, you saw them together? I didn't know that. - Um, yeah. Um, I ran into them at a restaurant a while back. That's how I knew he was cheating on me. Keys! - Yeah, well, what goes around comes around, right? I'm a big believer in karma. - Me too. Thanks for taking care of the plants while I'm gone. - I'll call you as soon as I get back. - Alright. Bye. - Okay, bye. [Laughing]: "Karma". Right. That should be enough to knock her out. ♪ [Struggling] I didn't want to kill Jordan. But it had to be done. The plan was the most important thing. This whole thing wasn't just for me. I was doing it for everyone woman who'd had the man she loved ripped away from her. Including my own mother. - Allison. - Dad, where are you going? - Uh... Honey, your mother will explain it to you. It has nothing to do with you.. Sometimes parents, they uh.. You'll understand when you're a little older. - Dad? Dad! Brian had a cabin outside of town. Taking Jordan's body there wasn't easy for me. He and I had some wonderful weekends at that place. But those times were over. - Mom, I honestly don't understand what the big deal is. No one's gonna know if I'm fifteen minutes late. - The judge made it very clear. Your curfew is eleven. - But it's summer. Everyone else gets to be out until at least midnight. I look like an idiot checking my watch every fifteen minutes. Come on. Mike and I are just gonna hang out and play guitar. That's it. - You're on probation, Scott, for one more year. [Sighs] - Brian. You get what I'm saying, right? Can you please explain to her that the whole world isn't gonna end because of 15 stupid minutes! - Well, I think if the judge wanted your curfew to be 11:15 he would've said so. But that's not really the point. What you mom is saying is that she wants you to do the right thing because it's the right thing to do. - No! You know what? Mom? I cannot wait until I turn 18 so I can get the hell out of here! - Aren't you glad you didn't have twins? I better get going. Harvey's been sick all week and his entire presentation is resting on my shoulders. - Oh, I'm sure they'll love your campaign, it'll be brilliant. - As long as it sells more toothpaste, everyone will be happy. Love you. - I love you. - Maybe just one more for the road. What are you doing for lunch tomorrow? I think I could finish this presentation around noon. - I'm free. - Good. Pick you up at 12:30. - Okay. - See you. - As usual. [Loud music in earphones] [Tires screeching] - Ah! Ah! - As you two get even closer, things might get harder for him. - Scott seems to like Brian. I mean, he hasn't come out and said that, but, he did ask him his opinion about a girl last week. - I'm not saying it has anything to with Brian, but when things get finalized and Brian moves in, Scott might be thinking more and more about the fact that he lost his dad. - I'm not sure he'd talk to me about that. - Well, just be patient. Scott will eventually figure out that you're not enemy number one. [Laughing] [Cell phone ringing] - Hi, this is Brian Hagan, not here to take your call. Please leave a message. [Beep] - Hey hon, it's me, I'm just wondering where you are. Maybe your presentation ran late. Um, give me a call when you get this. See you soon. [Ringing] - [Brian Hagan's office.] - Hi, Candice, it's Kathryn. Is Brian there? - [Uh, no. I was about to call you to see if you knew where he was.] [He didn't show up for his presentation this morning.] - What? - [And he didn't call. Nothing.] - Umm. That's not like him. Call me as soon as you hear from him, okay? - [I will. Bye.] [Cell phone ringing] - Thank God, sweetie, where are you? - [Man's voice]: May I speak to Kathryn Brown, please?] - I'm sorry, who is this? - [Detecting Simmons. I'm looking at Brian Hagan's emergency contact list.] - Emergency contact? - [Are you Kathryn Brown?] - Yes, that's me. - [What is your relationship to Mr. Hagan?] - He's my fiancé. What's going on? - [There's been an accident. I'm sorry. Mr. Hagan's dead.] - Wha... you don’t want me to stay longer? I can. - No, it's okay. - I'm gonna call later, and see how you're doing. But if there's anything at all that you need before then my cell is on. - Thanks, Joy. - Kathryn. Again, I'm... I'm so sorry. - Thanks, Ian, I'm glad you could make it. - So, have you heard from Jordan yet? - No, I called and left her a message on the cell phone number that Brian had for her, but she never called me back. - She may not even be in the country right now. She's always coming and going. Who knows if she even got the message. She'll be very upset she missed the funeral. Brian's the only family she had left. - When was the last time you talked to her? - I haven't seen her in two or three years. - I even called the woman who owns the boarding house where she stays, and she hasn't seen her in weeks. - There's not much more you can do. She'll get the message eventually. So, how are you holding up? - I'm still in shock to be honest. - Look, um, I'm going back to New York tomorrow. I'll back out here in a couple of weeks. I'd like to take you out to lunch or something. - Okay. Sure. Thanks for being such a good friend. - Well, I loved you very much. - Um, Kathryn? - Yes? - I'm sorry to just show up like this. Um, I just couldn't believe it when I heard. - Are you Jordan? - I can't believe he's gone! - Oh, honey. Come on in. - I was horrified when I finally got your message. And I realized I had missed his funeral. My cell phone was stolen. And I didn't replace it till I got back here. I was down in Charleston for a big rally. - Brian told me you were active in a lot of causes. - I was always busy. You know? I should've come to see him more often. When he told me that he was being transferred to Philadelphia, I told him... told him... that I would visit. And here he is, two years later, and I never did. - Honey, you could have never known this was gonna happen. - No. No one could've known I suppose. Well, even though I missed the funeral, I just... I have to help take care of his things, you know. There was so much to do. After our parents died. And um, Brian did most of it. - Where are you staying? Do you have friends here? - No. No, I don't know anybody in Philadelphia. I was thinking about staying at Brian's, but... I don't know, seeing all of his... stuff around me. Might be just too, um... hard. - I understand. [Sighs] - You know, I think I'll just get a room. I saw some motels. Out on the highway as I was coming into town. So. - Are you sure? Jordan, you can stay here with me. Wow, thank you. This is a beautiful home. - Thank you. - My husband and I bought it twenty years ago and, when he died, I um, I didn't want to leave. - Well, I can see why. Thank you for the invitation. - It's my pleasure. After all, you know, you're... practically family. - [Sobbing]: Oh, thanks. Brian told me you were a really nice person. - Extra blankets are in the closet. And the bathroom is just down the hall. - Oh, this is great, Kathryn. Much nicer than where I usually stay. - I'm sure you're tired, I'll let you get some rest. And I'm gonna go run some errands, and I'll make some dinner later. - Thank you. If there's anything I can do to help... - No, not at all. Just so you know, Scott should be home in about an hour, in case he gets here before I do. - Alright. Well, I can't wait to meet him. - Okay. - Kathryn bought my act, hook, line and sinker. She had no idea how much I wanted to meet her son. "Triple Kill." Will Scott and I become the best of friends? "Most definitely." - I did get the notice that you completed your community service. That's good. That's very good. So. How's work? - Fine. - You getting there on time? You're not having any problems with any of the other employees? - No problems. - Good. That's good. Keep following the rules, you'll be in good shape. - Uh, sir? Me and a couple of my friends, we're thinking of going to Baltimore to see a band there. - You know you can't leave the county. - Yeah, I know, but... I was thinking, maybe... - You know the rules, Scott. Look if things keep going smoothly, for the next six months or so, I'll consider it. But not for now. Look, you're on the good path. Stay on it. I'll see you in a couple of weeks, okay? And be on time. - Honey, do you have any concept of time? - Scott: [Yes!] - You said you would be home by now. - Yes, mom, I know I'm late. But I'm two seconds away from my car then I'm gonna get in, I'm going to drive, and I will be home in twenty minutes max. Give me a break, will you? I'm not seven years old. - He sometimes has trouble keeping on time. - Did Brian ever tell you anything about Scott? - Nothing really. - Well, he's been in some trouble lately. - Oh? - Two years ago, not long after his dad passed away, he and another boy, Jason, stole a car and went on a spray painting spree at Scott's school. - Uh-oh. - Yeah, so he's on probation, and has to follow all the rules or he may wind up back in juvenile hall. - Huh... Rules. What kind of rules? - Like he has to keep his appointments, obey his curfew, stay fairly close to home. - Wow, that must be tough for a teenager. He can't even leave the city? - He can't even leave the county. Which pretty much is the city. - What if he has to go on a school trip or something? - He can't go. A few weeks ago, his whole chemistry class went to Pittsburgh and he had to stay behind. - Wow. That's awful. - Uh, listen, because Scott's running a little late, I'm gonna go to the den and do some paper work. Um, do you mind watching the sauce? - No, no, that's fine. I just hit a major bump in my plan. I had no idea Scott was on a leash held by the police. It was going to be harder than I thought to get what I wanted from him. But I'd come too far to let this stop me. - [Scott]: Hello? - Hi. I'm Jordan. Brian's sister. - Scott. - Glad you could make it. - Your mother invited me to stay here for a few days. I hope you don't mind. - No, that's cool. I'm starving. - Then let's get that pasta. This one's of us in the Bahamas. God we loved that trip. - Wow, you really took a lot of pictures. - Yeah, and I organized them all into this album because Brian wasn't one for keeping them. I can't believe he didn't have any pictures of you. - Well, you know Brian. He wasn't into taking pictures. This is the three of us at the beach. Scott wanted to learn how to surf, so Brian and I took him. - [Brian]: A toast. To you. - Mm... - Mm... - I love champagne. You're such a gentleman. - Anything for your birthday. - I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. Since my grandmother died, I haven't had any family to celebrate with. And nothing is lonelier than being by yourself on your birthday. - Yes, well, this year will be different. - Everything's been different since I met you, Brian. I love you. - Mm, look at this one. - Wow. You look great. I'm really glad Brian found you. Did he tell you about any of his exes? - A little bit about his ex-wife, and then that one crazy woman he dated for a while. Did you ever meet her? - Uh, no. What was her name? - Uh, Ali, Alice, Allison, something like that. I don't know, a complete psycho. - No, he never said anything like that to me. - Well, he didn't really like to talk about her. I mean, he told me a couple of stories. Apparently she was very jealous and obsessive. She used to accuse him all the time of cheating on her. She would just show up at restaurants when he was trying to take clients out to dinner. - She did? - He finally just got so sick of her. He told me when he met me he was so happy to meet someone refreshingly normal. Can you imagine? Poor Brian. I miss him so much. - So do I. [Guitar playing] - Hey! - Hey. You're into music? Me too. - Yeah? What kind of music do you like? - Oh, all sorts of stuff. You know Top 40, alternative, rock. - What rock bands do you like? - Oh, well... My favorites would have to be, from classic rock, ACDC. And, um, newer bands, Triple kill. - Triple kill? Man I love those guys, I can't believe you listen to them. - Why wouldn't I? Don't you dare say I'm too old. - No no, that's not what I meant. You know, they're playing in Baltimore next month. - Really? Maybe we could go see them together. - No, I can't go. It's too far, you know. Part of my probation. - Well, that sucks. What if your mom was okay with it? - Mm-mm, I still couldn't go. My probation officer's like super strict. He'd totally freak. - Mm, well maybe they'll play Philadelphia soon. Hey, what's "Jitters Café"? - Oh, it's just a coffee shop where I work. - Well, maybe I'll come check it out. - Yeah, you know, anytime you want. - Cool. Well, I guess I'll let you get back to playing. - Yeah. - Hey. Maybe we can see Triple Kill, you know, some other time. - Yeah. - Think! Okay. There's gotta be a way. Good morning. It smells really wonderful. - Would you like some? - Sure. - Oh, by the way, I meant to tell you, Jordan, if you need help with Brian's things later, I'd be more than happy to help. - Aw, thanks. Thanks, but, I'll be okay. I'm just gonna head over there and start in on his stuff. - Morning. - Hey honey, would you like some breakfast before you go to work? - Mm, something quick. - Hey, I thought I might stop by the café later and grab a cappuccino. - Mm, yeah, that'd be cool. And it's on me. - Well then, if you're buying, I'll definitely stop by. I'll probably need a, you know, break later anyway. - Okay, well, I gotta role. - That's nice. - Do you happen to have a house key that I could borrow just in case I get back before you guys? - Absolutely. Top drawer on the left. - Thanks. - Hey. - Hey, yeah, I'm almost done here so... - No rush, I'll just go inside and decide what I want. - Okay. - Hi, can I help you? - Um, yes. I'd like an iced caramel coffee blended please. - Sure. - Her drinks on me okay, bro? - Ah, you must be Jordan. Scott told me about you. - Did he say nice things? - As a matter of fact, he did. - Hey, love your tat, that's cool. - Yeah, thanks. I got one on my back too. - Hey, uh, I was thinking of getting one too. - Yeah? I almost got one last year. - Yeah, my mom she'd probably flip out if I did though. I'd never hear the end of it. - Dude, so just get one where she can't see it. - There's one in a magazine that I saw that I really liked, but, I don't know. - You don't think your mom would be okay with it? I mean everybody's got them now. - Trust me, that doesn't matter. - See, I was thinking of getting one in memory of Brian. Kinda like, he'd always be with me. - That's a really good idea, Jordan. - I thought maybe a little sunburst on my back. Think I should do it? If it'll make you feel better, then yeah, definitely. - Will you go with me? We could do it now? - I would be happy to. Um, yeah! - Good. For Brian. - Okay. I just gotta get my bag and my jacket. - [Tattoo artist]: Alright, gorgeous, you're good to go. - [Laughing]: Are you sure you don't want one? - Ah, man. - I'll pay for it. - Okay. What the hell! Oh man! Okay, um... There's this design I saw in a magazine that I really liked. The Chinese character for Truth. So let's do it right here. - Alright, sounds good. Here we go. - You know, it doesn't even really hurt that much. - No, nothing compared to the horror stories you hear. Or maybe it's 'cause you're such a big, strong man. - So, uh, you hungry at all? - Yeah, yeah, I'm starving. Guess there's nothing like scarring your body to build up an appetite. - Uh, how about a burger? - Perfect, that'll hit the spot. [Cell phone ringing] - Just one sec. - Hello? - [Scott.] - Yeah, hi mom. - [Anything wrong?] - No no, everything's fine. Listen, you don't have to make dinner for me, or Jordan. - Are you sure? I defrosted your favorite steaks from the place you like. - [No thanks.] - Yeah, we're gonna grab something here before coming back. - [Alright.] - Okay, listen, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later - [Take care.] - Okay, bye. [Laughter] - Hi, honey, how was your day? - Uh, good. I'm gonna go lie down, watch a movie or something. - Are you feeling okay? - Yeah. Okay, good night. [Phone ringing] - Uh, would you mind? - Sure. - Hello? - [Is this Kathryn?] - Oh, no, no it isn't. Hang on a second. - Hello? - Kathryn, it's Ian. - Hi, Ian. Jordan, it's Ian. - Ian, Ian Mathews? - Oh! Yeah, I didn't recognize his voice. - Ian, guess what? Jordan's here. - [Wow, really?] - Yeah, she's staying with me for a few days. - I'll put her on when we're done. - [How you doing?] - Oh me? You know, I'm holding up pretty well, all things considered. - Scott's about the same, 17-year-old boy, you know how that is. - [Good.] - No, but Jordan, she's been great. - [Give her my best.] - Sure, I know she would love to see you. Do you want to talk to her right now? - [Sure, put her on.] - You know what? I am gonna call him later, my stomach is... Um, I'll be back. - Um, she can't talk right now, I guess. - Damn you Ian. Brian is dead! Leave us alone! - So how's Scott doing? - Well he and Jordan are getting along. They've become instant friends. - Really? - They even had dinner together last night. - Well, that's better than him hanging out with that one guy I suppose. What was his name? - Jason. - Right, Jason. - I can't complain. It's given me some time to myself that I didn't even know I needed really. - So, when are you coming back to work fulltime? I don't want to rush you, but I do miss seeing you everyday. - I was thinking probably Monday. I think it'll be good for you to get back. - It'll help get my mind off things. - You know, it does get better, Kathryn. I know that sounds trite at the moment, but it will get better. - Blood? You got a tattoo? Scott, what were you thinking? - Mom, honestly, this is not something to have a heart attack over. - It's something you're gonna regret later. - That's not true. - It's not just that. Why didn't you discuss it with me first? - Yeah, that would've been a good idea. - And second, you lied! You told me you were going to dinner instead of what you were really doing. - That's not how it happened, Kathryn, we did go to dinner. - Well, neither of you told me about the tattoo when you got home! - Well, yeah, that's 'cause I knew you were gonna flip out like this! - Oh, you want me to condone you getting a tattoo, Scott? - Mom, Jordan got one too! You know, the only person that's acting all psycho about this is you! - You got one together? - Honestly, Kathryn, I don't know what the big deal is. I mean they're everywhere. - He's 17, Jordan! - I'm sorry. I had not idea this would start a big fight. - No. Everything is a fight! - Scott. - I'm going to Mike's. - Scott? - Forget it! - I'm sorry, Kathryn. - I would've appreciated it if you had discussed this with me beforehand. And when I am in a discussion with my son, keep your opinions to yourself! - Of course. Hey! You're back. Come here. - I just wanted to apologize for getting you in trouble before. - No, that's okay, uh, don't worry about it. I knew how she was gonna react. I shouldn't have gotten a tattoo. - Well, since you guys are both so great, I hate to see you upset with each other. - Well, trust me, the fighting started a long time before you showed up. - Well, still. If you ever wanna get anything off your chest, you know where to find me. - Thanks. - I mean that. I like you a lot. - I like you too. - Good night. - 'Night. - Scott and I were growing ever closer now. And I was just waiting for the perfect opportunity to arise. To finally get what I wanted. - It isn't just her - Bro, bro. Man, check this out. Chemically Insane's gonna be at the Black Fox recording studio tomorrow night at 9. - And? - They're recording a new album. Oh, and did I mention who their new drummer is? Jason. - What?! - Yeah. I bumped into him this morning, he said we could go hang out at the studio tomorrow night with all those guys. - I don't know if I can go. Me and Jason aren't supposed to hang out with each other ever since we go arrested. - Oh man, come on! When are we ever gonna get another chance like this? - Man, I don't know. My mom's probably gonna freak out. And she's already pissed off about the whole tattoo thing. - So we leave by 10:45, you're home by 11. No problem. - Hmm! Alright, I'll work something out. - Clean that up. - Get out of here. - So, how is everything going at Brian's house? - Well, you know, it's hard. But I'm working on it. [Doorbell] - Ah, that must be Ian. - Ian? - Oh, I forgot to tell you. He called me earlier to say he was dropping by. - Damn it! - [Ian]: Is Jordan around? I haven't seen her in ages. - Yeah, she's here in the kitchen. Uh, she was in the kitchen. Jordan? I don't know where she went. - Okay, okay, wait. Who said anything about backing down? - Mike: [You did, bro.] - No, I never said I wasn't gonna go. - [So what are you gonna tell your mom?] - I don't know, I'll tell her we're going to a movie or something. - [Can you hang with us all night?] - No, I still have to be home by curfew. - [Sure, whatever.] - No, I need to hear you say it, Mike. - [Say what, dude?] - That I need to be home by 11. - [Okay, 11 o'clock.] - Okay. Um, so I'll look at, you know, see a movie that ends around 11. And I guess I'll pick you up... I'll pick you up later. Okay, I gotta go. Yeah. - [Catch you later.] - Alright, later man, bye. - Hey there. - Hey! What movie you guys going to tonight? Maybe I can tag along. - Okay, um, here's the thing. You gotta promise not to say anything to my mom. - Of course not. - We're not really going to a movie. There's this band that Mike and I like, and our friend Jason invited us to hang out with them tomorrow night, so. Jason is the guy that I got into trouble with. So I'm not really supposed to go. - Don't worry. I won't say a word. - Thanks, Jordan. Uh, maybe you and I could see a movie... some other time. - Sounds good. That's the good thing about secret plans. Sometimes you have to rely on other people to keep them a secret. - Jordan. What happened to you last night? - What do you mean? - Well, Ian was here and he wanted to say "hi". And we couldn't find you anywhere. - Oh, umm... Well, to tell you the truth, I just couldn't face him. You know, whenever I see somebody that knew Brian really well, it just makes me want to cry. It's so draining. - 'Morning. - Hi, honey. - Mom. Jordan. - Today's your day off, right? - Yeah. - Any big plans? - I'm gonna go see a movie with Mike probably, but other than that, no. - What about you, Jordan? - I'm gonna go up to Brian's and finish up, you know. - Well, I have late meetings. So, I'll be home around nine. Enjoy your movie, honey. - Yeah, okay. - Bye. Hey, Scott, would you be available any time this weekend to come up to Brian's cabin and help me finish packing up his stuff? I decided I'm gonna sell it. - Um, no, sorry, Jordan, I can't. My probation officer, he won't let me leave the county. - Oh, I'm sorry. No, I completely forgot. - Do you want me to ask Mike? If, you know, he could come and help you out. - No, no, that's okay. I'll find somebody. So have fun tonight. It'll stay our little secret. [Laughter and talking] - You guys sound as good live as you do on disk. - And I told you so! And could you believe that guitar solo? - Ah, tight! - You wanna pass me a beer, bro? - Sure. Scott? - Just a pop for me, man. - Hey, what's the deal with your P.O? I heard he's a real hard ass. - Yeah, you know. - I got so lucky! The chick I have, she doesn't care what I do, as long I don't get arrested again. - That's... That's... Dude! I don't know how you do it! - Ah, well, you know! - Yeah, it's a nice one. You did a good job filling it in. Hey man, we're ready to rehearse again. - Oh, hey listen, I gotta get going. But thanks for having us, man. - Anytime, bro. [Guitar playing] - Hey, you're ready to go? - I actually might hang around a little bit longer. Jason will drive me home. - Alright, cool. Later, bro. - Bro. [Engine not starting] - Damn it. [Dialing cell phone] [Cell phone ringing] - Hey, Scott. - [Hey, Jordan, where are you?] - Just driving back from Brian's, why? - [Uh. I'm in a bit of trouble. I could use your help.] [My car won't start. I think maybe my battery's dead or something.] - Don't worry about a thing. I'll be there to pick you up. Just give me the address. - 2213 Baker Street. In the parking lot behind the building. - Ten minutes. - Okay. Thanks, Jordan, I owe you one. - Yes, you do. - Police radio: [Unit 52. We have a report of suspicious activity in a parking lot] [at Baker and High Tower. White teenage male.] [Possible auto theft.] - This is Unit 52. I'll check it out. [Phone ringing] - Hello. - Hey, mom? - Scott, where are you? - [Uh, I'm at Mike's.] Um, listen, his neighbor, somebody, blocked my car in the driveway, so... We're trying to find them, but it could take a little while. - Okay. Do you want me to come pick you up? [We can get your car in the morning?] - No, that's okay. - I think Mike's brother is gonna give me a ride home, So I'm just calling to let you know that it might take a little bit longer. - Okay, well just get home soon, okay? - Okay, I will. Bye. [Police siren] - Megaphone: [Step back from the car please.] - Whose car is this? - Uh, it's mine. I'm just having trouble getting it started. - Can I see your license and registration, please? - One sec, my registration's in the car. - Okay, have a seat in the car. - Damn it. Well this certainly wasn't part of the plan. But I can see it making things turn out even better. - Come over here, please. - Scott, what's going on? - Who are you? - Uh, Jordan. A friend. He called for a ride when his car broke down. - Listen, Officer, he hasn't done anything wrong. - Relax, lady. We got a call that someone was breaking into a car here. - This is his car! - You're on probation. For vandalism and stealing a car. - But Officer, he hasn't done anything wrong. - He's in violation of his curfew. - I have extended curfew because I work. - Look, we'll go to the station, we'll take care of it from there. - Jordan! - I'm taking him to the Hoover station. Tell his parents to meet him there. Let's go. [Sighs] [Phone ringing] - Hello. - Kathryn, hi. It's Jordan. Listen, I don't know how to tell you this, but... Scott's on his way downtown. He's been arrested. - What?! - Um, yeah. It's just a misunderstanding.] His car broke down. And I was on my way to pick up him up, and someone must have thought that he was trying to steal the car [and called the cops, I don't really know.] - I don't understand. I just talked to Scott. He's at Mike's house. - Uh, yeah. Well, he's not with Mike. He was in a parking lot on Baker Street. And, look, I was just coming to get him, and, and.. [the cops were already here when I arrived.] - Oh, my God. Where did they take him? - Hoover Street station. Do you want me to meet you there? - No, I'll handle this myself. Can I speak with you? Jordan, this situation isn't working out anymore. - What do you mean? - I made it very clear to you that I didn't want you interfering with my son. And what's the first thing you do? You pick him up from somewhere he isn't even supposed to be. So I don't catch him in a lie. - Kathryn... I was just trying to help. I mean, I didn't think that... - Mom, don't talk to her that way. - Go upstairs to your room. - Mom, the only reason Jordan got involved was because I called her. - That's not the point. This thing you two have between you. Whatever it is. It needs to stop. [Breathing hard] - Jordan, I want you out by tomorrow. - What? Mom, what "thing"? - What are you talking about? - Oh, you know exactly what I'm talking about. - No, Mom! You know what it is? You're just jealous. You're kicking her out because you're jealous. You're jealous that she's cool, and fun, and easy to talk to and you're not! - Scott, go to your room! - You just hate the idea of me having any friends. - Kathryn, please. Can't we talk about this? - You can find a hotel. [Gasps] - Mom... I hate you. [Crying] - No, hey, come on. Jordan, please don't cry. Look, I'm really sorry about all of this. - I just don't know what I did wrong! - No, you didn't do anything wrong. It's just, this is just not fair. - I'm not gonna stay here if she doesn't want me to stay. Look, Kathryn, I will go, okay? Tomorrow, I will pack my things and I will go stay in Brian's cabin. - Thank you, Jordan Scott. - Leave me alone. - Did you remember you have an appointment with Officer Kingman today? - Yes. - How are you gonna get there? Your car's still downtown. - I'll take the bus. - Scott! Hey. - Did I, um, did I just overhear your mom saying you had an appointment with your probation officer? - Yeah, he's gonna be thrilled to death about what happened last night. - Seriously, Scott, you did nothing wrong last night. You know, why don't you let me go with you, and I can try to help explain it to him. I can give you a ride, and then afterwards, you can go get your car. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I mean, what happened to you last night was totally unfair. I was there, I saw it. - Okay. Yeah. Um... My appointment's in an hour. - Okay. Let's hop in the car. - I appreciate what you're saying, Miss Hagan but this isn't about curfew. The problem with the car, being late, I understand all that. What you don't seem to understand is that the judge made it perfectly clear that he was to have no contact with Jason. - I know you're just trying to help. But there's more to it than that. Thank you for coming in. But I need to speak to Scott. Alone. - Okay. - I really don't think you take this seriously. - Yes, I am. Okay, look. This wasn't about going to see Jason. I just wanted to meet the guys in the band, that's all! - You listen, Scott. One more screw up like this and... And I make it official. - What? Come on. - Straighten up, Scott! - I'm really sorry, Scott. - Don't worry. I mean, you tried to help. That was very cool of you. - You would've done the same thing for me. - Of course. - Sure I can't take you to your car? - Nah, it's just around the corner. - Keep in touch, okay? - Yeah. Hey, Jordan. Thank you. [Struggling] [Cell phone ringing] - Hello? - Scott. I am so glad to get you. It's Jordan. - Jordan. Hey, what's wrong? - Um, I'm really sorry to call you at work. Um... [I need your help. And I didn't know who else to call.] - Okay, tell me, what happened? - Well, I stopped at the store to get some boxes to pack up Brian's stuff. And I think somebody stole my wallet, or I lost it. I don't know. But I don't have any money or credit cards, [or anything!] - Okay, just calm down. [Calm down. Where are you?] - I'm at the cabin. And... [The SUV is almost out of gas, and I don't know what to do.] - Can you call the auto club? - No. You have to be a member. And have a card, and... My wallet, Scott. [My wallet is gone.] - Okay. Just let me think for a second. - [Scott, can you come and get me?] [I mean, you're the only one I know.] - Jordan. I can't. I mean... I'm at work. And I'm not supposed to go that far out. [Scott, please? I need help.] - Okay. I'll see if I can switch shifts with someone. And then I'll come get you. - Thank you, Scott. I knew I could count on you. - Listen, just sit tight, and I'll be there in an hour or so. - [Okay. Thanks.] - Hey Mike? - [Yeah.] - Hey, what's up, man? It's Scott. - [Hey, dude.] - Listen. I need you to do me a big favor. - [Thanks, Kathryn. We'll continue to work on it from our end] [and submit the budget to you next week.] - Great, thank you. - [Talk soon. Bye.] - Scott... - The mobile unit you are trying to reach is out of this service area. Please try your call again later. - "Out of this service area"? [Ringing] - Jitters Coffee Café, this is Mike. - Hi, Mike, this is Scott's mother. May I speak with him please? - Uh, he's... Uh, he left early. - Early why? - [I don't know.] He just called me and asked me to switch shifts. - And he didn't give you a reason? - Just that he was helping someone move, but... - Who? Jordan? - Uh... He didn't say exactly. - Gas is working. Alright then. [Phone ringing] - Hello? - Hello Jordan, this is Kathryn. I'm just calling because I really need to get a hold of Scott. - Oh, well I'm sorry, Kathryn, But there's no reason he'd be here. - No. I was just wondering if you knew where he could be. - No, I don't. Not at all. - Oh, well thank you. If you do happen to hear from him, will you please have him call me? - I sure will, Kathryn. Bye. - [Bye.] [Knocking] - Kathryn. Is something wrong? - I don't know. I can't find Scott anywhere. I called the coffee shop and they said he left to help somebody move, which made me think of Jordan, about the cabin. But she says she hasn't heard from him. - Well, he's not on his cell? - The message says it's out of range, which again made me think of the cabin. - And you sound like you don't believe Jordan. Well, she does know that he can't leave the city because of his probation. - She knows. But she also knew about his curfew too, and... In fact, every time Scott's been in trouble lately, she seems to be right there. - You'd think having her move out of your home would be enough. - Well, she wasn't necessarily overjoyed about that. You know what? I'm just gonna go up there and see for myself. - That's a long way to drive on a hunch. And we've been waiting for that meeting today for six months. - Tell Dean Smith I had a family emergency. But the absolute minute you find out his decision on the new budget proposals, please call me. Promise? - Sure. But you said cell phones don't work up there. - Right. Here is the landline to the cabin. Call me here. Okay. Thank you. - Hello? Jordan? - Scott! Hi! Oh, my God, I'm so glad to see you. - Don't worry about it. Everything's gonna be okay. - Oh, I'm sorry, I hope I didn't get you in any trouble. I just didn't know who else to call. - No, listen. Nobody's gonna find out. And besides, it's the least I could do for you. after everything you've done for me. So, umm... You wanna follow me to the gas station in the SUV? I got some cash and we can fill it up. - That's great. That's amazing. You know what? Could you just help me a bit? I gotta get all of this stuff packed up and that picture is way too big. I need help with that. So, what do you think? - Well, I don't have to be back for a little while. Couple of hours, so. - Great. Great. Well I'm exhausted, I'm gonna fall over. So I'm gonna get us some coffee. If you could get started on the knick knacks, that would be great. What do you take in your coffee? - Two sugars. - Okay. Here you go. - Oh, thanks. So, what are you gonna do with all this stuff? - Oh, I'm gonna donate most of it. Just keep a couple of things that remind me of Brian. Scott, can you hold this for me? - Yeah. - Scott? Scott? You okay? - What? Yeah, I don't know. I just... I'm just like really really tired all of a sudden. It just hit me. - Scott! [Scott groaning] Scott are you okay? - Yeah... No, I... I don't think so... I don't know. - Don't fight it. Just let yourself fall asleep. Just relax. It'll all be over soon. - What? - Don't worry. You'll be asleep. You won't feel a thing. I'm sorry. You're really an innocent victim. Victim of people like your mother. Who don't care if they ruin other people's lives. See, Scott, Brian and I were in love. We were soul mates. We were gonna be married till your mother took him from me. Now that old gas line in there is gonna leak. They'll be an explosion and a fire. The final part of my plan. To right the wrong your mother did to me. Like I said, don't worry. You'll be asleep. You won't feel a thing. First, I have to move your body into the den. So your remains are found next to Jordan's. - [Whispering]: Jordan...? - That's right. The DNA will show that you really died next to the real Jordan. Which won't come as any surprise. Since you had a crush on her. Or me. Didn't you? Don't worry. You'll be gone in a few minutes. - [Kathryn]: Scott? Jordan? Scott? Jordan, what's wrong with him? - I don't know! I don't know! He's sick. I went to the bathroom to look for something to give him but... - Scott, honey. Scott. What's wrong? - Mom... - He said he wasn't feeling well. And then he just fell into this chair. [Scott mumbling] - I don't know what's happening here. I'm gonna call 911. - Sorry, Kathryn. I'm afraid I can't let you do that. What the hell are you doing? - Well, this wasn't really part of the plan, but now that you're here, I guess you'll just have to suffer the same fate as your son. - Jordan, what are you talking about? - Well, for starters... It's not Jordan. It's Allison. Allison? The same Allison you stole Brian from? The same one you called "the crazy woman" that he dated before you. - Oh, my God. What did you do to my son? - He's just sleeping. You have no idea the time and effort that I have put into all of this. - All of what? - Well, getting close to you and Scott. Of course Jordan was the key. - The key to what? - I knew that if you lost Scott, you would feel the same pain that I felt when you took Brian from me. - That is not true. Allison, look. I know that you're mad at me. That's fine. But, please, Scott has nothing to do with this! Please let me help him! - No, you were supposed to live without Scott. The same way you made me live without Brian. But now I guess you just don't get to live at all. Scott's body was supposed to be found here next to Jordan's. And now, there's just gonna have to be three bodies. Instead of two. [Phone ringing] [Phone ringing] [Gunshot] [Struggling] - Ah! I love you. I knew it. Dad, where are you going? - Allison. - Dad! - Allison? Ah! [Dialing] - [911, what's your emergency?] - Yes, hello! I'm calling from a cabin on Avarench Road. There's been a shooting and we need help right away. - Hey! - Hi, honey. - So you said you'd be here at one. - And it's quarter after. - You're late. Maybe I inherited my "Always Late" gene from you. - Careful, buddy. You'll understand why I'm late when you know who I've just seen. Your probation officer. - Bad news? - Well, that all depends, on whether or not you like the band Triple Kill. - Mom, I don't get you. - He said you can go to their concert next week in Baltimore. - What?! Are you kidding? Man, that's awesome! - He'll allow it this one time. There's not that much time left in your probation anyway. - Oh, Mom! Thanks for making this happen. - There is one condition though. - Oh no. I knew it. - You gotta treat your mom to lunch. - I think I can handle that. This guy came in this morning, with fifty cents... ♪
