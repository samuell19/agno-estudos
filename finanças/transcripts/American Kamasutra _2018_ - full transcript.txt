brought to you by tbs2002 - Not yet. Not yet. Shh. - I didn't make you cum? So you're blaming me. - No, I just... You know I can't cum from penetration alone. - But you were moaning. You were-- 'Cause it's sex. It felt good. It just wasn't an orgasm. - Like I don't know what an orgasm sounds like? - No, I know you do. - Ask anyone I've ever been with. They've all cum. - I'm sure. - Ever since you've gotten laid off, every goddamn thing has been an issue. - That is so not true. - Oh, okay. - Our sex life has been a problem for a while now, and you know that. - I'm sorry, I didn't know you were so unsatisfied. - Oh, because all the bottles of lube on standby weren't a clue? - Maybe you just have a dry vagina. - Maybe you just don't understand that women need foreplay! - If you're so unhappy with this relationship, just say it. - I'm unhappy. I just have to find another place to live. - [Jules] Dude, come stay with me. - [Ashley] Jules, I have to find a job. - [Jules] You'll find a job here. Ivy may be a small town, but it's dope. There's cute shops, great food, cool people. This is your fresh start. What do you have to lose? - [Ashley] Oh. - Dude, you look so good. - Well, there's nothing like getting out a bad relationship to make a girl look her very best. This house is awesome. - I know! My mom worked her whole life just so she could afford her own place and never even got to enjoy it. - I'm really sorry about your mom. - I'm not, I mean, how rad is this house? Come on. Let me show you around! - Okay. I love it. But I will only be here for a few months. I have to figure out what I'm doing. - No, don't figure it out. Just stay here. I want you here. I need you here. It's not like you can go back to that shitty relationship. - I faked it for an entire year. - Faking it only reinforces bad technique. "Oh, yes, baby, keep ignoring my clit. "That's right, keep ignoring it! "Oh, that finger jabbing's gonna make me cum so hard." For future reference, you can gauge whether someone can fuck within the first five seconds of meeting them. - No, you can't. - Yeah. All good fucks have aural fixations. - Oral. - Aural. A person that can fuck does a lot of ear shit when they talk. - Okay. - I'm serious! What does an earlobe look like? A clit. Aural people subconsciously always have sex on the brain. - Jules. - I'm serious. I'm gonna find you a guy that'll make you cum. - By what, asking if he has an aural fixation? - Worked for me. I'm having killer sex right now. - You're in a relationship? - No, no, not a relationship. - Why not? - Married. - Oh, God. - And I work for both of them. - Jules. - I know, I know, I'm going to hell, but at least I'll see my mom again. - Where's the bathroom? Why do you always go after the people you can't have? - Why do you always settle for the ones you don't want? - I don't always settle. - Mm, maybe not. But remember, safe is easy, and easy does not make people cum. Nipple clamps. For sex. They're Dylan's, not mine. - These go on a guy? - No, no, no, Dylan, the other roommate, a chick. - Oh. - Yeah, but she's chill. I mean, she's into some, like, weird kinky shit, but you'll like her. - Okay. - All right, I've got some work crap I have to take care of and try not to shoot myself. There's beer and leftover tacos in the fridge. Actually, don't eat the tacos because I can't remember when I bought them and they probably have food poisoning. - Oh, yeah! What, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Hey! Hey, hold up a sec! - No, no, I'll come back later. - No, no, no. No, no, no, wait. Wait. Hey. I am so sorry. I did not hear you come in. - I figured. Yeah, let me grab you a cup of coffee. On the house. - You know, I'm fine. - No, no, no. Please, please. Our beans come from Kona. They're really great. Trust me, they're delicious. I'll even give you a bag to take home. Just give me one second. - Later. - Yeah, bye. See, I even washed my hands before going back to work. Okay. - [Ashley] Mm. - Yeah. There you go. Just have a little taste and tell me that that is not incredible. - It's great. When will your manager be back in? - Why, are you gonna report me? - No, I was wondering about the job. - The barista job. - I guess, there's a sign on your door. - Yeah, yeah. Done. Yours. - You're the manager? - Owner, actually. Raif Sterling. - You're kidding. - No. You can start tomorrow. - Don't you want to interview me? - You'll make coffee, you'll grind beans, you'll do fine. And, you know, don't worry. I promise I'm much more professional when there's actually customers here, so... - [Dylan] In the back, you know, like his dick is in me, right? And then this fucking chick just shows up and is staring at us, like, hardcore. - Oh, my God, who does that?! - [Dylan] I know! - [Jules] Has she never have had sex before? - [Dylan] I know, maybe she was like a virgin who'd never seen... - I thought you stopped banging Raif. - I needed to get laid. - She was just sitting there watching you guys? - Yep. She couldn't take her eyes off of us. Total creeper. Oh, my God. That's her. - That's Ashley. - Talk about a small world. - I guess a formal introduction isn't needed, since you've already seen her vagina. - Jules. - I'm Dylan. - [Ashley] Ashley. - Welcome to the family. - So, did you enjoy the show this morning, Ashley? - I'm really sorry about that. - Don't be sorry. You got a sneak peek at the world's most epic dick. - It is perfection, isn't it? - I didn't really notice. - It was sculpted by the gods. - You've seen it? - I've heard about it. - It's so thick, you can't quite fit your fingers all the way around it. And it's just the perfect length that he can totally plow the shit out of you and you can still walk home the next morning. - God, where can a person find a job that doesn't require that they work? Hey, how's Thailand?! Yeah. I was over there earlier. They're fine. Who told you that? Well, she's wrong. They're not dying. - Lay out with us. - Oh, I would, but I don't know where I packed my bikini. - Are you wearing a bra and panties? - Yeah. - There's your bikini. - [Elliott] You're late. - I'm sorry. I know your text said eight o'clock. - Look at me. Eight sharp. Did you find a girl yet? - Not yet. I'm still working on it. - That's a shame. - [Ashley Voiceover] My name is Maura, and I was his slave, a plain faced girl in a maid uniform that floated around his house, taking care of every corner and crevice. For years, he watched me from a distance. I wondered if he ever fantasized about me the way I had of him. But after a year of waiting, he finally made the move I'd been yearning for. I was distracted by a smudge on the window when his hand found the inside of my thigh. I tensed to his touch, but my breath came in an exhale. He ripped my underwear from my body. I was already wet with excitement. - Turn around. - [Ashley Voiceover] Should these ropes he used to tie me down suddenly break, I would not have moved. I was enslaved to him, and it was neither rope or cuff or belt that kept me there. - [Man] Where are your eyes? - [Ashley Voiceover] It was my unwavering need to feel his breath against my bare skin. I waited for the pain that I knew would come, not from the flame, but from the inevitable waning of emotion that seemed to take hold of every-- - [Dylan] Good morning. - Oh, my God. You scared me. - That's my book. - I'm sorry, I was just skimming through it. - You were drooling. - No, I wasn't. I don't really like books like this. - Okay. But if you change your mind, I'm having some girls over on Thursday night to talk about it. Book club thing. - You know what? That actually sounds like fun. - Okay. You can have my copy. It looks like you wore out the pages a little bit anyway. - Nolan Keats paints a provocative picture of the BDSM underworld. - Give me that. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. - I never took you as a closet freak. - I'm not, and didn't you promise to be more professional from now on? - Oh, I lied. - Of course you did. - So, what is this? You don't strike me as a girl who likes to read smut. - It's for Dylan's book club, and it's not smut. - Oh, okay. His penis throbbed. - Okay, you can stop embarrassing me. - I want to come to the book club. - Well, you can't. It's for women only. - Oh, too bad. Love to find out why sex books have suddenly become hip with chicks. - [Ashley] It's gospel. - It's a poorly written smut story. - Oh, just because the writer has a better understanding of women? - I have plenty understanding of women. - Okay, then explain Dylan to me. - The chick's crazy. - Yet you slept with her. - Guys don't have a problem banging crazy if crazy is hot enough. - Oh, no, she's not crazy. - Three months ago, she fucked a complete stranger in that bathroom over there. I'd say that's crazy. - What? - Yeah, some guy's girlfriend. Never even spoken to her before. - Wow. - Don't get me wrong. There's nothing wrong with casual sex. Casual sex is fucking great, but Dylan's weird. - Why, because she's as emotionally unavailable as you are? - Pretty much, yeah. - I don't know, I think it's kind of cool that a woman can be that spontaneous. - Oh, well, maybe you should try it sometime. - Who wouldn't want to get nailed like that? - [Tina] I wouldn't. It was textbook abuse. - It was not. - Maura was clearly a victim of Stockholm syndrome. - Oh, okay, that's extreme. - It was full on coercion. He was in a position of power. - Who cares if it was a position of power? - Kim, he used a riding crop on Olivia like she was some kind of animal. - Okay, so it's kinky-- - And he yanked that other one around with a leash. - [Man] Suck it. - [Kim] Calm down. It was just role-play. - [Tina] It was not just role-play. He forced them into actual slavery. - And yet they couldn't stop fantasizing about him. - Of course they couldn't, because it was written by a man. - So they say. - Please don't tell me you are buying into that it was written by a woman bullshit. - Well, maybe it was. - So if a woman wrote it, then we should be completely okay with misogyny, right? - No, that has nothing to do with it. - That has everything to do with it. Society wants us to believe that women are like these pathetic little creatures that live and die by a man's happiness. - Why is it pathetic if a woman wants to submit to a man? - Are you serious? - It isn't pathetic, and more women should give it a try. - Okay. The current identity of Nolan Keats is unknown. Many have suspected that the writer is actually a woman working under a pen name. Keats's literary agent recently announced that there will be no book tour for Slave, further fueling suspicions about his or her identity. - I'm rolling around in your bed right now so I can smell you. That's how bad it's gotten. So have you had the conversation yet? Okay, then when? Do you know how hard it is to be here in your bed when you're motocrossing all the way in Fuckit? Who get, whatever. How am I supposed to know how to pronounce a place halfway across the world? Oh, shit, that's my roommate. Hang on. What up? - Dylan just put Chelsea in her car, handcuffed and blindfolded. - Okay. - Okay? So you don't think that's a little bizarre? - Dude, it's Dylan. I told you, she's into some freaky shit. - But what was she doing? - Who knows? Who cares? I'm dealing with an actual crisis right now. - Why? What happened? Jules. - Are you still there? Of course you have to go. You always have to go. And I'm just here, alone, smelling your sheets, impaled by a bunch of swords. It's a metaphor. So, when you get back, you have to have the talk. I'm slowly dying here without you. - Oh, my God, I am so glad you're here. - Yeah, well, told you she was crazy. - Give me one logical reason why somebody would do that? - Dylan's not a logical person, so I can't. - But, I mean, that girl's gonna be okay, right? - Yeah, of course. Do you realize how crazy you sound? - No. - Okay, you need another beer. - Okay, you can make fun of me all you want, but Keats writes men that women actually want. - Mm-hm. - It's like aggression is this lost art form. Men have become these like passive little boys. - Oh, have they? - Yes. - All right. - Women just want a guy who can, you know, like, throw down and get dirty, you know? - Oh, no, no. No, no, no. - Oh, what-- - Raif, no. - What? - We are not doing this. - Why not? - Because I'm drunk. - Mm-hm. - And you're kind of drunk. - Yeah. - No. No. - [Raif] Wait, where are you going? - Jeez. (gentle music) Oh. - Last night was fun. - Yeah, okay, Raif, there's customers. - There's one customer, and we can go in the back. - [Ashley] Stop. - What's wrong? - I don't want to talk about this stuff at work. - We could talk about it at my place later. I'll be right back. - Good morning. - Oh, yes, it is. - Why? What happened? - Raif was pulling out of the driveway when I got home this morning. - Looks like the good girl had a bad girl night. - It's not what you think. - It's exactly what we think. - Was it epic? - It was fine. - Fine? - Yeah, it was just fine. - Fine is shit! Fine is not what you need right now. I want every horrific detail, but first I gotta go pee. Get me a coffee? - You didn't tell her, did you? - About what? - The surprise party. - Oh, no, I wouldn't do that. - Because she was asking if the three of us wanted to hang on Saturday, so I thought maybe she suspected something. - No, I would never do that. I know how to keep a secret. - Good to know. Too bad Raif doesn't. - [Jules] Hi! - How are you? - Thank you. Ash. - Excuse me for a second. - Oh, sure. - Hi. - Ash, these are my bosses, Scarlet and Tomas. - Oh, it's very nice to meet you. - Our pleasure. - I've heard wonderful things. - Not from Jules, I'm sure. - Shut up, you know I love you. - Cranberry vodka? - Please. Birthday girl, show me where the bar is. - Better watch out, I'm gonna steal your husband away. - Jules just adores you. - Well, she is the best. - I will scold her for not telling me how beautiful you are. - Oh, that's very nice of you to say. - And very honest. I'd love to photograph you sometime. Do you model? - Oh, I used to a little bit in high school, but not anymore. - Would you take your clothes off? - So, how was Fuckit? - Do you even care? - Not particularly. - So why would you ask? - Because pretending like I care gets me further with you than honesty. - You're drunk. - Not drunk enough. - It's not nudity in the exploitative sense. It's erotic art. - Either way, I don't take off my clothes in front of cameras. - Think about it. It's liberating. And I won't even keep the digital pictures. And you can pose with Jules. She's been begging me to shoot her. I think she likes the idea of her pictures hanging in our living room. - I bet she does. Could you excuse me for just one second? - Of course. - No more hiding from Raif. - I wasn't. - Dude, I am not blind. - I can't help it. It's just that work has been so awkward. It's like a nightmare. - You're making it a nightmare. What's the worst that could happen? He fucks you again, and then maybe this time you like it. Boom. - Yeah, or just makes it more awkward because I don't know how I feel about him. - Don't overthink it. Just play it cool, especially if there's a chance you like him. - Maybe you should play it cool. - What? - "Better watch out, I might steal your husband away." Really, Jules? - What? - You're parading him around right in front of her. - Ashley. - And she is so sweet and she really likes you. - [Dylan] What are your hard nos? - Hard nos are a cop out. - I totally agree. - Beg for the pain, don't shy away from it. - Exactly. - Can I get you another shot? - You know all the right things to say, don't you? (gentle music) This is a party. No more maid service. - Mm-mm. - Mm. - You are so fucking sexy. - I wasn't trying to be. - I think that is the best part. - Happy birthday to the baddest bitch I know. - Halfway to 50. - And you've got a whole lifetime of amazing sex ahead of you. - [Tina] She's got to find someone first. - [Kim] She'll find someone. - Well, I haven't found someone. - Yeah, but there are a whole slew of reasons you're still single. - You're such a bitch. - Can I talk to you privately? - No more shots without me, ladies. - Never. - Somebody's in trouble. - Uh-huh. - I've got a girl for you. - Is it her? - Ashley? No, she's-- - Dangerous. - In a relationship. - That never stopped us before. - She's also off limits. - I decide who's off limits. - So, you're stealing my husband away, are you? - You know I'd never do that. I might steal you away, though. - I'm down for anything. You decide. The dirtier the better. - Nothing's off limits. - You set the rules. I obey them. - If you'll excuse me for one moment. - I'm sorry. Elliott's version of foreplay is leaving women hanging. - Hey, why are you being like this? - Because I'm not in the mood. - Stop being so shy. You weren't shy the other night. - No. No, Raif. - Weren't you the one that said aggression was a lost art form? - This is not what I meant by that. - Hey! Let her go. - Who the fuck are you? There's hall monitors? This party's got a hall monitor? - I'll stand here all night, but I'm not leaving her alone with you. - You're way too fucking sober. I'm grabbing you a beer. - You okay? - Yeah. He's usually a pretty nice guy. He's just-- - Drunk. I'm Elliott, by the way. - Ashley. - Is this your room? - Yeah. Kind of a mess. - I don't mind a mess. That's quite an interesting book you've got over there. - [Ashley] It was for a book club. - Ah. Who is your favorite character? - You've read it? - I have. - I don't believe you. - It's true. - Well, what did you think? Most men think it's just smut. - What's wrong with smut? - Exactly. Um. Uh, Maura. Maura was my favorite character. - She was quite the contradiction. She was demure, but very powerful. - She had no idea how powerful. You know, most men just make fun of it, but, you know, Keats really understands the complexities of female sexuality. And I can't believe I just said that to a complete stranger. - Why? - You know, I read online somewhere that Keats is probably a woman, which is heartbreaking because-- - He's very much a man. - How do you know that? - Because I'm him. - Ah, you're Nolan Keats? - Yes. It's my pen name. - I don't believe you. - Give me your phone. - [Ashley] Why? - Just trust me. Let it go to voicemail. - [Woman] You've reached the voicemail of Nolan Keats. Please leave a message. - How'd you get his number? - You still don't believe me. - No. Nobody knows who he is. - A few do, and now you're one of them. - Why would you tell me? You don't even know me. - I'm a pretty good judge of character. I'm fairly certain I can trust you. If you still need proof, I can give it to you. - How? - Well, you two look like you're up to no good. - I was just heading to the bathroom. - Well, it's not in Ashley's bedroom. It's down the hall. - It was nice meeting you. - Jules is looking for you. - Okay. - And your boyfriend puked on the front lawn. - [Ashley] He's not my boyfriend. Jules. - But it's complicated. There's all these entanglements, the fucking photography business, a condo with these exotic plants. It's like you can't get married anymore without having all these commitments. - Well, that's what marriage is, Jules: commitments. - I didn't set out to break up a marriage. I didn't even make the first move. I was just driving us to this photography place, and the next thing I know, she's feeling me up at a stoplight and I have no idea-- - Uh. She? - Scarlet. - I thought you were having an affair with Tomas. - Dude, are you fucking kidding? The guy's a total douche. - Well, how was I supposed to know? You're hanging on him all night and... Wait a minute. Does this mean you're gay? - I don't like labels. - It's not a perfect fit. - Come here. Turn around. Looks good to me. Put your foot here. Tonight is all about role-play. - I like role-play. - I want you to be a virgin, an innocent girl. - Mail. (phone ringing) - Hello. - Did you get my gift? - I did. Thank you. - [Elliott] So now do you believe me? - I'm sorry I didn't before. - I don't blame you. It's good to be skeptical of strangers. - [Ashley] So is this the new book you have coming out in the fall? - Yes. - Wow. - [Elliott] What? - Oh. Okay, so when I heard there was a second book coming out, I freaked, I got so excited. - Well, I hope this one doesn't disappoint, then. - Oh, it won't. You're brilliant. In fact, I've been trying to figure out a way to contact you ever since I read Slave so I could tell you that. - Really? - I think, more than anything, I just wanted to say thank you. - [Elliott] For what? - That book completely changed my entire perspective on sex and love, and it opened up this part of me that-- - Dude, Tomas wants them to renew their wedding vows! - Okay. We'll talk about it later. - She hasn't told him she's leaving him! What the fuck?! - Hello? - I'm still here. - Oh, sorry. My roommate was having a crisis. What was I saying? - How my book changed your perspective on sex. - Oh, right. Yeah, it flipped on this switch inside me, and I haven't been the same since. - Elaborate. - Um. I had the most intense orgasm of my life reading your book. Hello? - [Elliott] I'll call you tomorrow. - No more games. - Jules, he's on his way back. - You have to tell him about us. - I will. - This is masochism, asking me to help plan a second wedding? - I didn't ask you. - No, he did, because you haven't told him you're leaving him. Why? - I'm waiting for the right time. - This is the right time. End it or I'm done. - I'm getting really tired of you telling me no. - Well, if you're such a fan of giving orders, why don't you find your own submissive? - I prefer being on my knees, begging you to give me what I want. - What is that? - I want to fuck you. It's been a while. You're frustrating me. - I've been busy. - What if I find us someone-- - Dylan. - Someone we can both have fun with? You know that I know what you like. - I'll think about it. - Why are you doing this to me? - Because any good submissive should learn restraint, and for whatever reason, you haven't yet. - God, I hate you. - You wish you hated me. - And the thing is, she just keeps giving me the runaround, making me believe that I'm her soulmate, when really, I'm just, like, her lesbo mistress. And I've read so many stories about mistresses, and they, like, never come out on top, like, ever. - Hello? - What I need is-- - [Elliott] Go somewhere private. - Evidence that proves that she's, like-- - I-- - I don't know, really cares about me. - I've got to take this. - Okay, but hurry the fuck up, because we've got to figure this out! - Okay. Okay. - I want you to turn two chapter two of Owned. - Okay. Why? - I want you to read it out loud to me. Want to hear how my words sound coming out of your mouth. - Okay, but I-- - [Elliott] Do it. - I was wet before he even touched me, aching for him to open me up and to crawl inside. No tenderness. My knees weakened to his touch. I'd just met him and yet my body was no longer my own. And-- - Finish the rest of the book by tomorrow morning. - No problem. - [Elliott] But you have to promise me one thing. - Okay. - No masturbating until I say so. - What? - I'll tell you when to cum. - You're kidding. - If you think my books excite you, imagine how intense the real thing could be. - I know how we can get the evidence! Dude, it's genius. - It's messed up. - Hell, Scarlet asked you to model for her. You're just doing what she wants. - Yeah, but I don't want to do it. - She won't suspect anything. Just get her to start talking to you. Tell her how much you dig her artwork, how creative and talented she is, and then, boom, ask her if she's leaving her husband. - Okay, this is so not subtle. - Well, then, figure out what you're gonna say, because I booked you an appointment on Thursday. - You're kidding me. - Nope. - [Elliott] Dear Ashley, I'd like to invite you a little deeper into my world. How would you feel about a real-life submissive experience with me as your guide? If this piques your interest, enclosed you'll find a sealed envelope with your first task. Don't open it unless you're willing to venture down a dark and twisted rabbit hole with me. - [Ashley] Here you go. - Oh. Thank you. - Mm-hm. - Thank you very much. - Hey, no more refills for that guy. - I thought it was unlimited refills. - He's pouring it in the fucking plant. - Why would he do that? - So he can keep coming back up here to stare at your tits. What were you thinking not wearing a bra today? Go in the back, put on my flannel. - I can't. - Do it. - My boss sent me home. - [Elliott] But your first task was successful. - I'm totally humiliated. - [Elliot] The point is to push you beyond your comfort zone. Enjoy it. - Now, where's that shy girl who didn't want to pose for me the other night? - She's trying to be a little bolder. - Well, there's nothing to be nervous about. All right, so keep the robe on, but let it drape off your shoulder a little bit. You should be proud of yourself for embracing an adventurous spirit. We've all become so scared to take any risks anymore. Become slaves to our own boring lives. All of us, slaves to our jobs, our bank accounts. I love my husband. Well, he's done a lot for me professionally, and there's a part of me that's very protective of our marriage because of that. So the question becomes: Do I love him for him, or do I love him because of what he's done for my career? The lines get blurred. You see that picture hanging over there? I love that photograph. It sort of embodies the very struggle that I'm talking about. Who are they? - These two women I shot many years ago. They were slaves to their marriages. I've never seen a connection quite like theirs. - Did they end up together? - No. Of course not. They stayed with their husbands. - That's tragic. - Not every love story ends like a romance novel. - Jules is very vulnerable, Scarlet. - I know that. - She wants the romance novel. - Well, then she's reading the wrong book. - Hey, is everything okay? - When I call, you pick up. That's how this works. - I'm sorry, I was doing this thing for Jules and-- - You can't just disappear whenever you want. - I'm sorry. I didn't. - [Elliott] This is not a typical relationship, Ashley. - I know. - And if you're not cut out for it-- - No, no, I am. I'm still just trying to figure everything out. - It's simple. Just give up control. - I know. I'm trying. - [Elliott] You'll learn. - Are you mad at me? - No. - Okay, good. - But I will have to punish you. - What's the punishment? - You want me to what?! - Spank me, five times. - Why? - It's this whole new age psychological practice where adults benefit from childhood punishment as a way of changing their behaviors. You should really read about it. - I don't need to read about it. I'll do whatever you want. Just give me your ass, and tell me what happened with Scarlet. Start talking. - Okay. So she cares about you a lot. - I know that. - But I think she's torn. - Really? How? - Spank me. One. She's really committed to her career. I mean, she loves her job. - This isn't news. - But it's, like, her top priority, even more than love. - She says she loves her job more than me. - No, but-- Two. Love does come at a price. - What does that mean? - I don't know, it's just, she-- - Tell me! - Three. She doesn't want to sacrifice her marriage for what it's done for her career. - What it's done for her career? Tomas has done shit for her career. - Four. - All he does is hang around like a fucking leech! - Five. - Sucking every ounce of happiness from her. - Six. - Taking her money. - Seven. - Taking credit for all of her talent! - Eight. - As if she can't be successful without him! - Nine, Jules, stop! - He's a lying, manipulative prick who does everything he can to keep her down! I fucking hate him! - You were supposed to stop at five. - Sorry, but your ass is here and I'm pissed! - [Ashley] So did you get the picture? - [Elliott] Red and swollen, my favorite. I wish that had been my hand. - Yeah, well, she went crazy and spanked me, like, 10 times. - I told you only five. - Well, what was I supposed to do? She just wouldn't stop. - Follow my instructions. You can't disobey me, Ashley. I'm going to have to punish you again. - Are you serious? - [Elliott] Yes. - Well, then you're just gonna have to do it in person. - Are you giving me orders? - Maybe. - I'm gonna have to keep you on a tight leash, aren't I? - Probably. - I'll text you my address in a bit. 9:00 p.m. Not a minute late. What the hell are you doing here?! - Oh, I'm not leaving until we fuck. - You can't show up at my house like this! - You never had a problem with it before. - Well, yeah, I'm drawing the line now. - Well, that's no fun. - Where'd you park the car? - The garage. What's wrong with you? - I don't want you here. - Well, too bad. - Very funny, very funny. Where's the key? Where's the fucking key, Dylan? - Inside of me. - You are unbelievable! - You love it. - Uncuff me. - You know where the key is. Uncuff yourself. - I mean it, now. Goddammit, Dylan! Give me your other hand. When I get back, you won't be able to sit for a week. - Ooh, I must be in trouble. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - The blindfold stays on the entire time. - But I want to see your face. - This is your punishment, remember? - Well, when do I get a reward? - When you start doing exactly as I say. - Hi. - Hi. - That might have been my most favorite punishment yet. - Well, I went a little easy on you given you haven't done this before. - Mm. Hi. - Right on time. Come in. Welcome to my home away from home. Look around. - Wow. I've never seen anything like this before. - You nervous? - No. I'm just taking it all in. Saran wrap? - It's for sensory deprivation, specifically mummification. - Mummification? You wrap someone in this? - Yes. - As what, some sort of punishment? - Sometimes. I like to do it as an exercise in trust. - Okay, now I'm nervous. - Why? - We're not gonna do that, are we? Because I'm really claustrophobic and I don't think I could... - My goal is to open you up, not to shut you down. You will never have to do anything you don't want to do. So how do you feel about restraints? If you feel uncomfortable in any way, just tell me. - Okay. - We should establish a safe word before things get too intense. - It's already intense. - We haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg. - Cactus. Our safe word. Cactus. - Okay. Why cactus? - Because it's beautiful and-- - You think cactus are beautiful? - Yes. It's beautiful and it has the ability to cause great pain. I think that's very fitting for this scenario, no? What? - Okay, cactus it is. But don't be afraid of pain. Pain can be fun sometimes. Impressive. - Well, I aim to please. - You do. - What are you doing? - [Elliott] I'm heading out for a bit. - Are you kidding me? - What's the fun of giving you what you want exactly when you want it? - So, what would you guys say if I told you I was going to start practicing polyfidelity? - Is that a religion? - No, it's like polyamory, but with monogamy. - Wait. What's polyamory? - Okay, so it's like this: I'm in love with a married woman, and for the last eight months, I've been nagging her to define her relationship by conventional standards when I fucking hate convention. - Convention's overrated. - Exactly! Vanilla relationships equal vanilla sex. You probably know this better than anybody. - Well, I'm working on changing that. - With who? - Dude, don't get sidetracked. - It's nobody you know. - Wait, so there is somebody? - No, there's nobody. I just mean I'm opening myself up a bit more. - Oh, like with the spanking thing. - Jules. - She made me spank her. - How unconventional. - But getting back to the whole Scarlet thing, what I've come to realize over the last few days is that there is a way for our relationship to work, and that way is polyfidelity. - You still haven't told us what that is. - Why don't you just find someone who's actually available? - That's the thing, Scarlet is available. - Yeah, to her husband, not you. - Yeah, but she can be available to me when I come to accept and embrace the choices that she's made. - And by "accept the choices," you mean accept the marriage. - Yeah. And by embrace the choices, I mean I'm going to start fucking both of them! - So what's his name? - What? - You've been smiling since you walked in today, and I know it's not from the Kona beans, so... - Maybe I'm just happy. Why does it have to be about a guy? - Delivery for Ashley Pendleton. - Thank you. - Pain is beautiful and so are you. - Hey, give me that! - You know, no self-respecting guy would ever say that to a chick. - Yeah, well, no self-respecting guy would ever call a woman a chick. What? - I just think it's a little too early in the game to be sending each other gifts. - It's not a game. - Oh, sweetie, it's a game. He's playing you. Hard. - Don't call me sweetie. - You know, you really need to start cleaning up after your whores. - Where'd you find those? - On the floor of the cellar. - [Elliott] Give them to me. - Whose are they? - Now. - So, this is why you've been acting like such a little bitch lately? You've been carrying on with a secret affair? - What I do outside of our arrangement is none of your business. - Who you fuck around with is our arrangement. What's her name? Tell me. - God, you're exhausting. - Why, 'cause I call you on your bullshit? - No, because you never stop pushing! - Strong women are intimidating, aren't they? - You're not strong. You're pathetic. You want everyone to think that you're this tough girl, but you reek of desperation. - Do I? - You want to know why I'm having this secret affair? It's because I need someone to hold my interest. You bore me. My eyes glaze over whenever you talk because I know what you're going to say before you even open your mouth. I pay you, remember? To find me women, to do my errands, to do the dirty work. But you're not worth the hassle anymore. So, leave me the keys and get the fuck outta here. - Mail. - What made you change your mind? - [Ashley] What you said. - About? - I need you to know that I'm yours. - Ashley, we've-- - You've been so patient with me. I want to prove how committed I am to this and to you. - You already have. - Fine. Then let me prove it to myself. - Take off your clothes. - I'll still be able to talk, right? - Of course. - And you're not gonna blindfold me again, are you? - You took the blindfold, remember? - Right. - I want you to keep your eyes locked on me the whole time. - Okay. - [Elliott] And if you feel afraid at any moment, you can-- - Use my safe word? - Fuck! Okay. - [Elliot] You ready for this? - I don't think-- - It's gonna get really warm in just a little bit. Relax your mind. Stay present. Don't let your imagination tell you how to feel. Just feel. - Fuck. She was a fun girl. The nondisclosure was a nice touch. Jackpot. - He had full possession over me, and I had become a slave to his every need. I lived to be dominated by him. Are your books based on real life? - Sometimes. - Do you think you'll ever write about us? - I'd rather keep that sacred. - This is my favorite part. I crave those moments where he would look at me, down on my knees, and know he'd put me there, taught me that, enslaved me to him. - [Dylan] Nondisclosure was a nice touch. - [Elliott] Sells the story. - I was an insatiable demon willing to stop at nothing to please him. We had reached the point of no return, and now all I wanted was-- - I have to go. - Why? - Something came up at work. A deadline. - [Dylan] I bet you didn't see that one coming, did you? - Stop being such a cunt. - You better be careful. I'll send it to her. I'm sure she would love to know what a manipulative little prick you really are. - What do you want? - Sit down. Why did you go after her when I told you not to? - Because I don't take orders from anyone. - You do now. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just tell her everything? - Because she doesn't deserve it. - Neither did any of the other girls. - Yeah, well, she's different. - How?! How is she so different, Elliott?! - She just is. - You don't want to talk, fine. I'll send the email. - Don't you dare. - Then start talking. - I didn't expect it to go this far. I was going to end it after the first night, but-- - But what?! - I got caught up in it, okay? She was sweet and-- - She was a fangirl sucked in by a name. - That's not true. She could be anybody else, and I wouldn't care what you would tell them about me, but-- - But what?! You're in love with her. - What do you want? I'll do anything. I'll give you money. - I don't want your money. - Then what do you want? - Her. - What? - Loan her to me. Eight o'clock tomorrow night, bring her here. She doesn't show or leaves early, I tell her everything. - You're fucking nuts. - [Dylan] And you're terrified. - It's funny you bring this up. Tomorrow night, I'm going to lend you out to another dominant. It might give you the perspective that you need. - What do you mean "loan me out"? - Let me finish. - No. No. I don't want to be with anybody else. - Me having you submit to someone else is-- - Is a no. - Ashley-- - No! No other people. Absolutely not. - Listen to me! I need you to explore this world as much as you possibly can. - I am. - How can you if you're not willing to take risks? I need to know what you do and do not want-- - I don't want this. - Well, I need you to want this. It's not all about you. It's about me and what I need for this relationship to work. Trust is an ongoing thing, Ashley. - Okay. - Okay? - I'll do it. - Couldn't convince her to come, could you? - She'll be here. I'm not sure why I need to be here. - You're late. - What are you doing here? - Elliott didn't tell you? - He didn't tell me it would be you. - Don't look so scared. - I'm not. I just... I don't understand what's going on. - I'm training to be a dominant, and since I don't have my own submissive, Elliott was kind enough to let me borrow you. Stand here. Are you deaf? Stand here. When I give you an instruction, you follow it the first time I ask. Understood? - Yes. - Tonight, I'm not your roommate. I'm the bitch you answer to. Clear? - Clear. - Why didn't you tell me it was her? - Would it have mattered? - It might have. What exactly is your relationship with her? - There is no relationship. - Have you had sex with her? - Yes. - Are you still? - No. Of course not. She worked for me. I hired her to find me submissives, and, occasionally, I would allow her to join in on the fun. But I tired of her very quickly. - I don't want to do anything like that ever again. - You won't have to. I know you're mine now. - I was always yours. What are you doing? - Moving out. - Why? - I only planned on being here for a few months. It's been almost a year. Time to move on. - This doesn't have anything to do with last night, does it? - Why would it be? - I don't know. - Look, you're the one that should be all fucked up, knowing your boyfriend pimped you out to somebody else. - He didn't. - Okay. - You know, no offense, Dylan, but you know nothing about our relationship. - No, but I know quite a bit about Elliott. - Not as much as I do. - You've known him for a month. I've spent nearly every day with him for the past year. - Running his errands and getting him women. - Is that all he told you? - I know you two slept together, if that's what you're smiling about. And I also know you got needy and that's why he ended it. - I wasn't needy. I was frustrated. - Because he didn't love you. He told me everything, Dylan. - Even about Nolan Keats? - Yes. I've known he's Nolan since the day I met him. - Let me show you something. - I have to go to work. - I'll be quick. - What is this? - Just wait. Just watch. - That was delightful. - She was a fun girl. The nondisclosure was a nice touch. - [Elliott] Sells the story. - [Dylan] You're good, I'll give you that. - I know. - Hey, is Nolan Keats aware you're using that name to get women? - Nolan is well-aware. - I'm guessing by your reaction he never told you that. I thought you knew everything. - No. No, no, no, no, no, no! He's Nolan Keats! He told me he was, plus he gave me a copy of his new book that's coming out in the fall. How would he have that?! - Elliott is Nolan Keats's copy editor, Ashley. He's been working with Nolan's publisher for years. Nolan Keats introduced me to Elliott and doesn't even live in Ivy. Nolan doesn't do interviews and would never talk to a little fangirl. Elliott is not Nolan Keats. - [Woman] You've reached the voicemail of Nolan Keats. Please leave a message. - [Dylan] Hey, Elliott, it's Dylan. Listen, I just wanted to call really quickly and thank you for last night. I know now that I'm definitely not cut out to be a submissive. But Ashley, on the other hand, she most certainly is. Unfortunately, I don't think that after this morning she'll be submitting to you anymore because I told her everything. I guess, in a weird way, keeping the little Nolan Keats thing a secret felt almost like an act of submission, and as you know quite well, I'm really bad at submission. I make a far better dominant. So, I showed her the video and explained to her who Nolan Keats really is, not because it was the right thing to do, but because it was the ultimate act of domination, not just over her, but over you. - I did it! I fucking ended it! Where the fuck is everybody? Dylan! Dylan! Holy shit. - There you go. That'll be $10. - Brewed coffee. 10 bucks. Man. - Is Dylan here? - Excuse me! - No, nobody's here. Dylan's not here. Nobody's here. - Where's Ashley? - Ashley called out sick, Dylan's a no-show, and I have no employees here today, so please get in line. - Wait. Does this mean you're hiring? - Ashley. - What are you doing here? - Please. - Get out of here. - Let me explain. - Don't come near me. - Please. - You're a sociopath! - Just-- - I don't want to listen to anything you have to say! - Just let me tell you my side. Please! - You played me! - No. - Just like you played everyone else! - You were different. - Why? Because you didn't videotape us fucking?! - Ashley-- - You should be locked up. - I was gonna tell you. - When? - I was waiting for the right time, okay? - Oh, yeah, 'cause there is no right time to tell someone that their entire relationship is based on a lie! - You know that's not true. - How is that not true?! You've been lying to me since day one! You sent me his fucking book as proof! - And you ate up every word of it. - Excuse me? - You wanted to believe I was him! - I had no reason not to! - You just loved the fact that you were dating some sex writer. Ashley. - Hi, Nolan.
