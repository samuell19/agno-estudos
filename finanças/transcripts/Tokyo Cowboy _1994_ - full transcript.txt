Cowboy. I mean seriously. Serious. That is so strange. Was it really Kate that made you want to be a cowboy? Yes and movie. When I was a kid, I go to a western movie. I want a movie never ending. After I walk on the street, I was very surprised. Everybody looked very uh, strange. At home, I go to mirror. I can't believe who is there. A boy with little eyes going up like this. Little nose, not big cowboy nose. He's, he is Japanese. I was very disappointing. God, it's a beautiful country. Beautiful. How did you say beautiful in Japanese? It's [inaudible]. [inaudible]. How about I love you? We really don't say this. What? Well how do you tell someone you're sweet on her? Uh, I like you skedas. Skedas? Skedas. Doesn't have enough oomph. Skedas!

You're staying at my mother's? You never told me that. I told him not to. Why? What is going on here? That's what I'd like to know. Come on, Michelle. I liked him, Chelle. He was the only person I felt comfortable about having over here. Now there's nobody. Why can't he come over? Because he's her little spy. He is not her little spy. He doesn't have a clue. And anyway, if you would just tell your mother, she wouldn't need a spy. You know when I really started to hate this place? When I was in grade seven. There were these three little native girls in my class. The boys used to tease them. You know, call them names, even when the teacher was right there. One of these girls had these beautiful long braids. And I knew, by that age, that I was lying to my girlfriend's and pretending with the boys. And I knew that if they could've seen inside of me, they would've done it to me, too. Done what? Set my hair on fire. Please. Honey, please. Let's just go. Please. I can't Katie. Honey, just think about those teachers you had. I'm not like that. I teach my kids to respect themselves and each other. We could leave at Christmas. If you told them now, they'd have time to find another teacher. God, why should I give up a job I love and am good at when you won't even try? I try! No, you don't try. Honey, you are just hiding out here. You are giving people reason to talk by being so secretive. It's not that we can't be normal people here. It's that you won't act like one. So what am I supposed to do then? Just call up some old friends. Invite them over. What do you think they're going to do? Examine our sheets? No. Ewe. Come on. OK. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, Katie. Behave yourself, Chelle. Hey, I have to work. Yeah! OK. See you then. Bye. What a playa! Ooh, party! Can I bring my fiance? I am not wearing a dress. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. Ah! It's only a vacuum. Goodness. Stop it! Please! Please! I hate being tickled! Are you going to behave yourself? Come on! We got a lot of work to do. So go do it! I'm too tired now. [clearing throat].

Yeah, what are you doing here? How do you two know each other? Oh, well me and the kid are organizing a major cultural exchange. Yeah, the Indians are going to Japan. And the Japanese are coming out west, east. Do you tell everyone that you're an Indian? Well I am an Indian. And I'm a geisha girl. Excuse me. So far so good. You look so cute. A girl does what she can. Come here you. What is it, No? Please, I have a question. Yes? Bill. He's not Indian? The guy's a fraud. Fraud? A fake. Katie Beatty. Ha! Little, pimply face Katie Beatty.

I love you deeply. I'll never recover. I, I, I need you baby. I'm hurting. Only you can make it right. Don't let us interrupt. We're just looking around. It's because I'm an Indian, isn't it?
