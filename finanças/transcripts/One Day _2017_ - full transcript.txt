Brother-in-law ONE DAY Good morning Mr. Lee. Oh, hi. You have a visitor. I do? He's in the waiting room. Hey, Young-woo! It's been awhile. How could you? Why don't we talk outside? It's like you were waiting for her to die! Huh? Now that she's gone, you must be relieved. You better watch what you say. Then go ahead, deny it. Come on. Just do it. Stop that. Say it! What's going on? Nothing. He's not usually like this. He's just in a bad mood today. Stop that! Are you okay, Sir? So there is no way to settle? What have you done? I'm very sorry, Sir. We need to close this case ASAP! You know what I'm saying? What happened to you? Nothing. Go on. Are you okay? What's going on? A traffic accident. And the girl is in a coma, for 2 months now. The driver was found 100% responsible. He's our client. The victim is blind. So it's bad for us. Can't settle with the family? She's an orphan, so her guardian should settle, except she won't budge. No excuse! If she doesn't budge, make her budge. Geez, this client is the son of our CEO's friend. We're all dead, if he ends up in jail. Find a solution, please? You must be sick of the desk work now. Just get back out there, okay? - Hey Mr. Cha. - Sir? Hand over everything to Mr. Lee. Will do. Look over the files and start on the case. National Central Hospital Hi Mr. Lee! How have you been? Long time no see. What's that over there? What? Great day, huh? I'll see you around, okay? Hey, Dr. Kim! Oh well. Hey. Good to see you! How's it going? It's been awhile. I know. How are you? Good. I'll see you soon. Okay. Excuse me. Anyone here? Ms. Dan Mi-so, I'm Lee Kwang-soo from Korean Insurance. I'm here to investigate possible insurance fraud for your accident... Wait, you can see me? What? Uh-oh. You can see me! Who are you? Oh hi. I'm with Korean Insurance. Again? You look new. Yeah, I just took it over. - Why do you keep coming? - Why are you going through my stuff? I wasn't. I was just looking. You did what? No, I wasn't going through it. I was just looking at the stuff on top... Huh? Well, I've seen the patient, I can come back later. - Okay. - You're leaving? I'll be back. Again? Yes... I met with the doctor too. He said there hasn't been any progress. He didn't say that she could die soon or anything like that? It will be easier to reach a settlement if she dies. What about her guardian? I'm on my way to see her. See if you can change her mind. I'm counting on you! What a scumbag. My turn! - Wow! - Gotcha! It's alright. How much did I lose? - Here we go again! - Man! Having fun? Can I join? Say hello. This is Mr. Lee from Korean Insurance. He's in charge of insurance fraud... whatever... My legs... I missed you. Yeah, yeah. So did I. You don't look so good. Are you sick, for real? Why are you always doing this to me? I'm not the only bogus patients here. I thought you stopped working in the field now. I told you I missed you. Damn it. So you two go way back. And worked together. You must be close. Did you notice anything strange, before the accident? What're you saying? Did anything happen? Did she get depressed...? Nope. The accident occurred in Gangwon. Why did she go there? Maybe she just took a trip. A blind, all by herself? Visually impaired. Excuse me? Not blind, visually impaired. I see. My apology. A few of you came here. And asked exactly one thing. Whether she tried to kill herself. That's not how I meant... Please leave. We won't bargain with her life, ever. Korea Welfare Foundation Damn it, it's not gonna be easy. Let's wrap up. Evidence Collection Report No walking stick at the site? - A cane? - Yes. I didn't see it on the report. A stick for the blind? Nope, wasn't there. Are you sure? Right. Thank you, Inspector. - Take care. - Thank you. Mother! - Hi. - Please come in. - This is for you. - Thank you. Sorry I didn't come to the funeral. No, no. You've been busy. I heard Young-woo made a scene at your office. I'm sorry. It was fine. I'm okay. Oh, I almost forgot. These go into the fridge. I've got this, Mother. So upstairs. Did you have a chance to clear up? No, I've been busy. What are you doing? It's not fully fermented yet! Try some. It's good. No way. Are you alright today? Have you ever... wanted to die? Every single day. Every single day. Geez, he almost got me. Oh, hi Mi-so. You're awake. I came to give this back to you. I almost took it. Can you hear me? Why did you go... all the way out there without the stick? The life was too tough for you? Weren't you... scared though? Even if you can't see, you must get scared, right? You must be... Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure you were scared. But you know what...? I admire... your courage. Throwing everything... I've got none of that. Mi-so? Who gave you that name? Mi-so. It's a pretty. It's a pretty name. One of my friend really hated her name. Sun-hwa, it means 'good flower'. I liked it but she thought it was tacky. Look here. It's freezing! Stop it. I'm sorry. There he goes again. Yes, Choi Doo-yong. At #209? Thanks. Where did she go? Who? She was just here. I didn't see anyone. Are you sure? Who won yesterday? It was all Min-ji. Good morning! You scared me. You've been busy, I see. What are you doing here? It's like the universe is calling out to me here. Well, go on. I'm up for another appointment. Would you stop that? What do you mean? I could hand you over for special investigation. I'm not faking! You and I go way back. Just let this slide, will you? I'm going easy on you. Others would've reported you. You'd be in for a big lawsuit. Remember me? I was going to wake you up earlier, but you looked tired. So I didn't. Who are you? - Me? I'm Choi Doo-yong. - I'm Dan Mi-so. Dan Mi-so? Would you cut it out? I'm Dan Mi-so. Who're you kidding? I said who are you? You? Damn it, I told you! Just calm down and listen. You better watch your attitude! Not you, man. Look at her. It's no use. He can't see me. Don't you see this girl? If you're kidding, it's not fun. She's talking crazy over here. Why are you doing this to me? Mr. Lee? You came to return my pebble last night, right? How do you know? What's wrong with you? Because I'm Mi-so. If you're Mi-so, who's that girl lying there? - That girl is me! - I better leave. Look lady, I don't know you but that's enough. OK? I had a really long day. Wait! Would you just listen? I can explain. - I don't need any explanation. - Hold on. What do you want? Just listen. Okay, okay. Go on. Uh... well... Will you stop that? I'm a busy man. I know you're shocked. Oh... oh... I gotta go. Well... Mr. Lee! You're leaving early... Ouch. That must hurt. Sun-hwa Honey, it's me. She is dreaming now. When she's asleep, I'm here. When she awakes, I'm gone. So... Since when? Since the accident. Suddenly, I was watching her from outside. It was weird. I can see everything. But people can't see me. That wasn't nice. So only I can see you? Looks that way. So you're a ghost. Ghosts are dead. But look, I'm still breathing. Why is this happening to me? I understand. That was my reaction too. So what's gonna happen to me? You're asking the wrong person. You're obviously curious. Asking all those questions. Not really... I could die, I guess? Why would you think that? At least someone can see me. That's a relief. Can I ask you a favor? What is it? No way. - I really need your help! - I told you, I'm busy! Please... I'm already going crazy just talking to you. And now, you want me to take you where? I'm begging you. I'm begging you to go by yourself, okay? You're almost a ghost. You can go anywhere, no? Fly or teleport, whatever! Read a magic spell and disappear. I can't. I'm too scared to go out by myself. Scared? You scare me! Even if I go out, I wouldn't know where to go. It's none of my business. Please, sir... Please, please, please... Wow. How did they build all that? Well. Ah, you don't know? That's a train, right? That's a tram. Right. I saw it on TV. You 'saw' it on TV? What's that? That's a gas station. That's how they fill the tank. Amazing! Geez, he scared me! You scared me, lady! What was that? Motorcycle. Ah... motorcycle... Do you even know what it is? Of course, I've heard of it. Well, now you know how it looks. That I do. - Good. - Motor... - Now we start the wedding of... - We're late! I'll wait here. So go ahead. Damn it... Now the bride and groom will exchange bows. Go ahead, face each other. Let's exchange bows in respect. They look great together. A round of applause everyone! - Now, please face forward. - Don't they? Now it's time to exchange wedding rings. This is the last to chance to bail out! Any objection to this marriage? What are you doing? Ah, no no. It isn't me. Sorry. Sorry. Really, it's not me. You must be a friend of these two. Guess he prepared a surprise event. - Now, let's watch a special video. - Are you kidding me? Congrats on your wedding! I love you two. I wish you the best. I love you. Good boy! - He only listens to you. - Down boy. Good! Happy birthday to you. Give some to Mi-so. - No sharing? - Everyone got a piece? I chose it, actually... - It's so good. - Thanks! Congratulations on your marriage! You must be really close to them huh? Yeah. They're like my family. It's so nice to see you for real. His name is Mango. He was my guide dog. And now lives here. Do you wanna touch his chin? He loves it. Pardon me? Go ahead. You know I can't. Dogs scare me. He doesn't bite, right? Of course not. He's a good dog. Good boy. Right? Shall we go? Take care, Mango. Will I ever wake up again? You are the only person I can ask. Thank you for today. About my accident report. Do what you need to do. It doesn't matter to me. So where is the guardian? She's on her honeymoon. So what, we just wait? Also the representative doesn't seem to want to settle it. So we can't do anything? We keep paying and our client ends up in jail? I got a call from upstairs. About your promotion. Aren't you worried at all? And you're spending all the money you have paying your wife's hospital bills. Will you quit it? I heard you. There must be a way to make them settle! You know I love you right? Mr. Lee. Yes. I found something for Mi-so's case. What is it? I read the papers again. And there was no walking stick at the site of the accident. I know that already. You did? So that's our catch. Since a blind rarely walks without a walking stick, it could be a suicide... I'll handle that. So you knew. And Mr. Cha. She's not a blind. She's visually impaired. You got that? Ah, yes. Tell me about the accident... I was on my way home from work, waiting for the traffic light at the intersection... How is she today? Good, I guess. She's sleeping a lot though. Hello. Where are you? I'm at the hospital. About that Mi-so case, I heard there was no walking stick. Excuse me? Cha says there was no walking stick at the site. You knew? Oh yes. And? That's our leverage. What am I supposed to do? The representative won't budge. Think, you idiot. A blind with no cane, it's a suicide. We're going to a trial, if she doesn't cave. Is that really necessary? We're gonna close the case one and for all, okay? Hello, hello? Are you going out? Or being discharged? Something urgent came up. Don't you have a job? Stop following me around! I'm reporting you, right now. Mr. Lee, come on. I've been nice to you so far. Just a few more days. I really have a situation. Please, I'm asking you. I'm done listening to you. Just sign here, right now. You know it inside and out already. Just sign it. You're so uptight. You don't have the right to say that. Many people try to live sincere lives. What are you doing? You're taking advantage of your insurance! Like leeches. What did you say? Well. How dare you? I don't deserve this. Not from you! So what, you're gonna hit me now? That's right, you moron. This is your lucky day. Well then, go ahead. You don't scare me. Signed. OK? I'm gonna go. Mr. Bastard Hey... Have you ever seen a ghost? Sure. For real? There's one right now. Right next to you. What're you doing? Just appreciating the sunlight. Oh yeah? I'll join you. Looking down from up here, I feel like human beings are so tiny. Like the pebbles I collect, don't you think? Why do you collect them? I just like touching it. Because we rely on touch a lot. I can indicate everything with my hand. And if not, smell. Give it. - Give you what? - Your hand. What for? Just give it! Geez... Through touch... I can feel how the person's been living his live, without seeing him. Try with mine. No. Just try it. Fine. Close your eyes! Well? I'm not sure what I'm doing. Once you get used to it, you learn a lot just by touching. Isn't it better that you can see now? Of course. But... now I can't touch. It's weird. Like being a little mermaid? Mermaid... God doesn't give us everything. I guess that's only fair. Hey, let's get out of here. How does it feel to see them for real? Love it. It's awesome. Look! Mommy, it looks like a rainbow! A rainbow? It sparkles like a rainbow. Oh yeah. You're right! Do you remember anything about your mom? Just her voice. I was too little anyway. She left me at church when I was 4. With only a photo of a birthday in my pocket written about my birthday and name. She probably gave me my name as 'Mi-so' because she wanted me to smile. She probably sent me away because it was hard for her to raise me. I understand. I would do the same if I were her. Do you miss her? I used to but not anymore. I'm already grown up and... It was such a long time ago. I feel like I've been here. I can smell sesame seed... From where? How? It's fresh. Ah.. that's how it's done. These are sold in plastic bags still? Oh, look at that. Doesn't it look like snow? It does look like snow. Well? I used to travel a lot. How far have you gone? Not drinking today? I have to drive. I have to drive someone's home. You can't see her? She's right here. Right. She is pretty. I'll buy one. Can she see me? Not sure. You scared me. Blue Hawaii. Blue Hawaii? Like the ocean. Whoa. So pretty. Not sure if you can drink it. Take a close look. It's an old photo. The house can't be there still. But you're the expert. I know you can do it. I'll give it a try. Don't let anybody else know. Especially my team manager. Is this something personal? You could say that. I'm sorry. Where the hell is Mr. Lee? He's out on the field work. I didn't send him out for this petty commission. I have a favor to ask you. He's not even answering the phone! Investigation Report The photo was taken at a studio in Gangwon. That's where the accident happened, right? Hello, it's a hair salon. Hi, can I speak to Ms. Kim? Speaking, who's this? Hi, you're here for a haircut? Yes. Do you have any children? Yes, why? Do you have a girl? She's at school. Do you know her? Not that daughter. By any chance... A long time ago... Dan Mi-so. She's my friend. About 2 months ago, she came here. I don't understand. She got into a car accident near here on March 5th around 3:50. She's hospitalized at the National Hospital, and she's a vegetable now. Stop it. I want you to leave. Don't you want to see her? I don't know who she is. Leave. Now! Thank you. See you later, guys. Thank you. So that's it then? You didn't show up for days, and no settlement? Mr. Cha. Sir? I'm giving you Lee's cases back to you. It looks like this one needs more time off. You take back the blind girl's case. Threaten them with lawsuit, okay? Damn it. Hey! Up here! Come up here. Hurry! What's going on? And I... You should help him. I can't. He's here all by himself. They are all families. I'm not even his father. Just pretend it. I can't do that! You look like father from head to toe. No I'm not. I can't. Please, just this once. Dad, dad, just this once okay? I said, no! Can I take a look? It looks so difficult. Your dad looks like a nice guy. Where is he? He says my hospital bills are really expensive. So he works at construction sites in the day and does deliveries at night. There you go. Now let's stick it on the paper. That's it. A little help would be nice. You know I want to. Look at that. It flies so high! Make it go far! We're #1! Have you done this before? You're good! No, no! That was close! Dad! Right here! Hurry up! You're a good man. Yeah right. Lady first. Thanks. You go ahead. I need to run an errand first. Sure. See you later. Ma'am. Why don't you come in? I just came to see her, but I can't go in. You came all the way. Please come in. Is she... dying? I can't answer that. She needs you now. More than ever. I can't. I don't deserve her. Ma'am! I just wanted to help you. I know. You don't have to explain. But... But you really shouldn't have. Then that wouldn't be happened. It's not your fault anyway. I should've told you that I've met her already. Why didn't you? I was ashamed of it, I guess... Missing my mom who never came to see me. I didn't want to show that side to others. And one day when I grow up... I'll go see her... I've been just waiting for the right time. Where are you going? Going alone? Hi. Come in. I'll be with you shortly. I've found my mother after all this time. I tried to be brave. Please, have a sit. Come here. Sit here. Anything you want? Haircut, please. Sure. Do you live around here? No, in Seoul. You traveled far... I'm Dan Mi-so. Sorry if I scared you. I wasn't sure at first, but just recognize your voice. How have you been? I just turned 25 this year. Sorry. You came to the wrong place. I don't want to bother you. I won't even call you mom. I just wanted to tell you that I'm okay... I'm sorry. But I'm not your mother. You asked me if I gave up on my life. Yes, I guess you may be right... I felt miserable. So terrible to be abandoned twice. Well, now you know what happened. Would that help you? It doesn't matter anymore. I'm off your case now. Then we won't see each other often anymore. I can get fired too. But you know... Things could get worse. I feel sick... What's going on? Are you okay? Saturation 92. Dopamine injection now! Yes, sir. And more Oxygen. Yes. It keeps dropping, 89, 88... She needs a CPR. Sir, you can't be here. Dopamine injection. Please wait outside. What level, Sir? 20. I need one more Epi. Now! Excuse me, what's going on? Open the door. Oh, my god... I'll call the anesthesiology. We offered settlements and will finalize by this weekend. I think they'll take the offer. I told you so. Nothing impossible! Mi-so doesn't have much time. I know it's hard, but please hear me out. Please... Mom! Wanna smoke? You don't look good. How is your boy? It's not like he can get better just like that. Why didn't you tell me about your son? What's the use? I should go. My son's waiting. Bro! Take care of yourself, okay? Thank you. Her legal guardian? Yes, you'll take over all her rights. Settlement for accident, trial, and collecting the insurance... Yes, you'll take over all her rights instead of Ho-jung here. Excuse me? I'm her mother, not a guardian. So I don't need these rights. Have you lost your mind? You're taking care of her, but you won't sign the paper? What if she dies? You can't even take care of yourself! It was hard for you too. You're still struggling. You must've hated me. I'm sorry I hurt you. I owe you an apology. Her birth mom? Yes, we have Mi-so's birth mom, and she's asking for more time. We have no choice but accept. I don't understand. Who found her? You? You did this, huh? Did a great job. Finding the mother for a blind orphan. Are we what? A charity organization? Stop bullshitting! What? Sir, it's not a 'blind'. It's 'visually impaired'. It's not safe over there. Not scared huh? Not really. Well, maybe a little. That's good. I hate pretending. The sky at this time is the most beautiful. Yeah. When I couldn't see, I would've given everything for these. It's great I can see like this. But now, I miss the old time. Why? Isn't it good to be with your mom? Of course it's good, but... I can't do anything for her. I can't even wipe her tears... The longer I hold on, it'll be harder for her. So rather than watching her suffer... It's better if I let go now. I'm leaving here anyway... I don't want the people I love to suffer. What are you talking about? I need your help. Are you out of your mind? I know it's hard, but you can do this. For me... No, I can't. You're the only one who can help. Help me leave before it gets too tough. I can't. I won't. Okay... I understand... No. You can't. Ever. Sun-hwa, are you okay? I never thought that it would ever happen to me. Honey, I'm sorry. What're you talking about? There's nothing to worry. Never say that again. Be honest. Don't you ever wish I should be dead? No, never. I can see it on your face. You want me to be gone! It was scared to see how illness changes people. One cigarette won't kill me. Give it back, now! Why should I go through this? I became helpless. Hun, can we go see an ocean? I just want everything to be ended. - Honey... - Yes? I'm cold. Can you get me a blanket? Sure. I'll be back soon. Where did she go? God... Sir, please. Excuse me. Please wait here. She was bleeding too much. I saw you there for the first time. The last moment would be more memorable than the first, right? This is... where I wanted to be, at the last moment. Will you remember me? Stop it. Promise, that you'll remember me. I don't wanna hear it. It'll be sad, if no one remembers. We've done this before, right? This way, you won't forget. Now, you won't forget, right? How... how can I forget you? I meant, as our happy memories. I know it was hard for you. I just wanted to leave good memories to you. I am sorry. No, Sun-hwa. I am sorry. ONE DAY
