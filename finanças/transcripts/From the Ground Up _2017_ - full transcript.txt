[soft music] [Santino] They say life is a series of choices. Some seemingly small and insignificant. Others agonizing and life-altering. Yet somehow the choices that seem the smallest are often the greatest. The choice to go for an extra inch, for an extra rep. The choice to eat this instead of that. The choice to fight, to forget the noise, and believe in yourself. The choice to empathize, to love, to make right when wrong. The choice to protect what is sacred. The choice to think deeper, faster, to self-examine, to rise above the politics and demand the truth. The choice to risk it all, to admit failure when it comes because it will. The choice to stand back up or not, to bend, not break. When encountering these choices, the roots always determine the strength. These roots are the parts inside that web, cross, connect and weave in ways no one can see, that are built in the dark, in the dirt, in the heat, in solitude, in the lowest of places. Only with these strong roots can a series of choices lead to great heights. Only then is it possible to look out upon the world with love and pride in how it has grown from the ground up. [soft upbeat music] [heartbeats] [Santino] My name is Santino Panico, most of my life I've been an athlete. [crowd shouting] [Santino] In fact, at one time, all I wanted to be was a football player. [crowd shouting and cheering] [Santino] I dedicated every waking moment to the game. [Santino] I ate, slept and breathed it. It was my first love and I was willing to run through a brick wall to achieve my goals. [whistle blowing] Football was important to him because he wanted to make something out of himself and accomplish something. It was a goal he set for himself that he was not gonna be denied of. [commentator] There were 15 Jackson's pass completed to number 30, Santino Panico, for a touchdown. But whatever he did, he always did it with passion, determination and left everything on the field when he was out there. [players shouting] Santino and I would battle a lot with the subject of his changes, because, I, as a mother, wanted him to partake more in the things that other children were doing. I didn't understand why football had to be a 24/7 goal. [Santino] My mom was concerned not only because I was training non-stop, but also because I was eating non-stop, consuming around 7,500 calories a day. All day it was prot-- "I have to get protein, protein, protein." And to be honest with you, I didn't even know what foods gave him all the protein. All I just kept cooking was meat. [Santino] In three short years and without a growth spurt, I gained 125 pounds eating mostly eggs, chicken, dairy and steak. My commitment to the game paid off. By the end of my senior season, I was named to every Illinois All-State team and awarded the Gatorade Illinois Football Player of the Year. I was also named U.S. Army All-American, one of the top 78 high school football players in the country. [sportscaster] ...back into quarterback. -[crowd shouting and cheering] -[whistle blowing] [sportscaster 1] And Miller can't hold on to the pass. Got hit hard. [sportscaster 2] It was Santino Panico. He's the ball player of his time. 67 people flied from Chicago down here to see him play, and he's the Gatorade Player of the Year of state of Illinois. [Santino] But nothing compared to being offered a full scholarship to play at a powerhouse football school like the University of Nebraska. [sportscaster] ...pressure. Gives it a ride. [Santino] his was everything I worked for. My dreams were coming true. Here I was starting as a true freshman for one of the most storied college football programs. [sportscaster] It gets in the way. Good shape, Santino Panico has the-- [Santino] Unfortunately, my career was anything but a storybook. Statistically speaking, I was the worst punt returner in the history of Nebraska football. [sportscaster] ...20 and the ball popped lose. Nebraska may be around it though... [Santino] Just like that, my football dreams were over. What took a lifetime to build, was destroyed in one season. Failing at football was tough to swallow. But even worse than the embarrassment in Nebraska, I didn't feel well. My body was breaking down. Almost daily, I experienced migraines, indigestion, and fatigue. With no conclusive answers from doctors and after what felt like hundreds of appointments, I decided to research the impacts of diet on health. The studies I looked at revealed that Western diets with large amounts of meat and animal products, were linked to some of the most common and often fatal diseases. Although the information was frightening, these studies offered a potential solution to my symptoms: A plant-based diet. I had two options: vegetarian or vegan. Vegetarians eat primarily plant foods and sometimes dairy and eggs, whereas vegans eat only plant foods. With all the dairy and eggs I'd consumed in my life, I figured, "To hell with it, I'm going vegan." And I started to feel better. With my health back, I became active again, and felt in love with running. [calm guitar music] Running clears my head. It keeps me focused. It allows me to be competitive, and my competitive side wants to know if I can push my physical limits on a vegan diet. So I'm going to run the New York City Marathon. While I'm training for this race I want to learn about the lead vegetarian and vegan athletes. Why would they choose to go against the status quo and eat plant-based? [calm guitar music] When I played football, my coaches, trainers and nutritionists championed animal products is the best fuel to become stronger, faster and bigger. Where does this dominant idea come from? Ancient writings reveal that throughout many of the first Olympic Games athletes trained and competed primarily on a vegetarian diet consisting of leafy vegetables, fruits, cheese and wheat. Then came Milo of Croton, a six-time Olympic wrestling champion. According to legend, Milo gained the strength by lifting full-grown bulls, wrestling with lions and eating 20 pounds of meat each day. Some experts believe Milo's myth in part, inspired athletes to eat meat for performance enhancement. Besides eating large quantities of bull and goat meat, Olympic competitors began eating lion heart and deer liver in hopes that consumption would provide bravery, speed, strength and power. Over 2500 years later, athletes still believe that meat will improve their performance and fear the effects of not eating it. [cheerful string music] [traffic noises] [horn honking] When I first started a vegan diet, it wasn't too difficult to stick with. But after a few weeks I began craving Italian food. With a name like Santino Panico, I'm full-blooded Italian. And when one thinks of Italians, usually food comes to mind. Italians love to cook and love to eat. And Italian dishes are loaded with animal protein. [cheerful Italian music] My family owns a traditional Italian restaurant where my grandmother worked until her late 80s. [her speech is drowned by the narration] Throughout my entire life, I was able to eat homemade Italian dishes anytime that I wanted and the majority of those dishes had some form of animal protein. I'm talking sausage and peppers, chicken marsala, and an assortment of cheeses and fish. We Italians love our cheese and we love our fish. When I became vegan, essentially I was going against everything that I came to love in my culture. And my family was a little perplexed. When he approached us with the fact that he was now going to eat vegan, I had absolutely no clue what that meant. We were very shocked and surprised. We were wondering what this was all about because he loved his meat. You know, he loved to eat like us Italians do. So, yeah, we were shocked. Grandma didn't understand what it was all about. So, you know, it was hard for us to explain, "He's not gonna eat any more meat. Ma, forget about it, there's no more meat." [chuckles] [laughter in background] -I'd like to tell you what I really thought. -[interviewer] Tell us. What I really thought was, "What the [beep] is a vegan diet?" [laughter] I had no clue at all what he was even talking about, vegan. I thought a vegan was a guy named vegetables, I didn't know what else he did. He explained it to me and I said, "Are you sure you wanna do that?" And he got into all this stuff I didn't understand and that was it. [Santino] Okay, eating meat and being Italian go hand-in-hand. So it makes sense that my family was confused. But they weren't the only ones. I got all sorts of questions. But one sticks out in particular, especially in relation to plant-based athletes. I mean, I think the most common question, of course is, where do you get your protein. How do you get enough protein? Where do I get my protein? Where do you get your protein? How do you get enough protein? How do you get enough protein? How do you get your protein? Where do you get your protein? Where do you get your protein? Where do you get your protein? Where do I get my protein? Where do you get your protein? Where do you get your protein? Where I get my protein. Where do you get your protein? Where do I get my protein? So the first response, you know, I wanna have is, "Do I look like I'm not getting protein? I mean, really?" And-- But my true answer is, "Oh, I get my protein from the same place that the animal that you eat gets his." [Santino] So what is protein? What role does it play in the body? And how much does the body really need? So protein is one of the three macronutrients. There's carbohydrates, there's fat, and there's protein. And we need all three of them. Protein is composed of different amino acids. Those are the little building blocks that we use to make a protein. And we need protein because it's involved in numerous physiologic activities in the body. So, you know, maintaining cells, cellular function, uh, hormones, enzymes, bones, muscles and blood. So we need protein for-- for all of those things, it's important. I think there's this perception that by taking an excess protein you're gonna build more muscle. And by definition, it's excess. You don't need it. Once you have excess protein, it's either going to turn into fat, which is what often happens, or it's gonna get broken down by your kidneys and your liver often at some stress to those organs. We're in this Western society where we believe that more is better. And I use this analogy, it's kind of like you're building a house and you need a certain amount of bricks. And you put these bricks in your front yard and you take them and you put them in the house and you build the house. Then you got the house finished and you keep putting bricks into the front yard. And that's the problem. Your body can't utilize those bricks anymore and the build-up can have really negative effects in your body. [Santino] With all the emphasis on protein consumption, let's take a look at how much a person needs in their day. In nutritional sciences, it is generally accepted that the average person needs about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. What this means is that if you are the average-- an average 70-kilogram man, which is about 154 pounds, that means that you need about 56 grams of protein. [Santino] For an athlete, protein consumption can increase to between 1.4 and 1.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. Take me, for example. I'm a 180-pound man training for a marathon, therefore, I need about 148 grams of protein per day. So where will I get this protein? Here are some comparisons between the foods that I ate when I played football and the foods that I eat now. Three eggs contain 18 grams of protein, whereas one cup of oats contains 26 grams of protein. Two ounces of chicken breasts contain 18 grams of protein, whereas one cup of lentils contains 18 grams of protein. One cup of cow's milk contains 8 grams of protein, whereas one cup of soy milk contains 8 grams of protein. Everything you eat has protein in it. Even fruits have amino acids in it. So it turns out that, yes, protein is important, but, yes, nature provides for us in surplus through all the different fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans and seeds. [music fades out] [clock ticking] [upbeat music] [footsteps thumping] [indistinct chatter] [Santino] After a hard track workout it's crucial that my body recovers. Lucky for me, today is taco bowl Tuesday. I get an excellent source of fat from avocados and guacamole, high protein from tofu and good carbs from brown rice and black beans, This meal will definitely help me get stronger for my next run. You know, if experienced a lot of men who joke about vegans not being capable of strength. Not alone toughness or masculinity. [clattering] [calm music] [Santino] Athletes who compete in sports like boxing... [groaning] ...mixed martial arts or collegiate in Olympic wrestling, are pretty damn tough. They better be, or they're not going to last very long. But to be tough, do athletes need to be compromised? Does being strong require a lack of empathy? When I competed, I never associated what I ate with my toughness or masculinity. When I went vegan, I was caught off guard by the amount of people who questioned my masculinity because of my diet. It was during this time that I realized there is a pervasive believe in society that only real men eat meat. [quiet guitar music] So I grew up hunting and fishing. And bringing home wild game is kind of a masculine thing. It's this idea that you're putting food on the table. And... We've been entrenched in this idea that males are providers. And I think our food is a big part of that. And a big part of the meal is centered around meat. So I think there's that link that you have to be a provider, you have to be strong and you have to be this male dominant figure. And meat goes hand in hand with that. To me it's such a Neanderthal sort of caveman idea that that's what... [growling] ...we would find tough. You know? If it is just reduced down to me kill animal, me strong, get pussy? You know, it's like that, that's what we're talking about? You know, that's that simple? But look at the world that we live in, you know. You got people watching American Idol and, and getting their food from like Starbucks and, and McDonald's. There's nothing masculine about eating meat. It's the most ridiculous notion I've ever heard. And I think anyone that buys into that shit is a moron. [Santino] What's with the sexual politics of meat? And why are meat and masculinity connected? [Carol] So the sexual politics of meat looks at the cultural assumptions that say men need to eat meat and examines why we hold on to this myth: Meat gives masculinity. When we talk about masculinity and meat consumption, um, we're really looking at his-- a historical phenomena particularly and in some ways unique to North America. Um-- This, this is a country that has a long frontier tradition of, you, you know, people from Europe, er, settling, creating a dominant culture. And what that required was not so much hunting, which we tend to think of when we think of masculinity and, and meat eating, I mean hunting sort of pops into mind. But historically it was domesticating animals. One of the quickest and easiest ways for a man in particular to assert his authority was to domesticate animals. If you had to hunt for, for your food, you were somehow perceived to be um, less manly, less in control. By domesticating animals, by controlling them, you kind of asserted your manhood. You said I can control this animal, I'm in charge of myself, I'm in charge of my family, I can feed my family, I don't have to duck into the woods to chase down animals to shoot because that's a waste of time, it's inefficient and shows a lack of control. So, I mean from the start, you have this emphasis on controlling animals as essential to rugged individualism and manhood. When it came to the United States, more people could eat meat because there was enough land. So we-- we Americans redefined meat eating. It became something associated with an inalienable right. But this inalienable right was very male-defined. So this notion of who had the right to meat, even as it became embedded within a sort of democratic notion of this is a natural thing for us to eat meat in the United States, had implicit male identification. Men are supposed to eat meat for strength, for protein, for male privilege. If men are the ones who have the right to eat meat, to not eat meat is to give up your male privilege. Why would you do that? [Santino] These outdated ideas about meat and masculinity are reinforced today through marketing campaigns. Just look at a magazine rack, walk down the street or sit in a train station and there one can find some advertisement trying to convince consumers meat is inherently tied to one's masculinity. [Carol] This recurrent claim that to eat meat mans up, man up for two times the bacon, and the interesting thing here is that as mystique eats the burger truly has manned up. Why is masculinity so unstable that it's got to be constantly renewed? My library card lasts for 15 years, 20 years. [Santino] Considering the belief that meat gives masculinity, it's no surprise that in the sports world, the stereotype of a vegetarian and vegan is a slender and non-threatening endurance athlete. But take a look at the world of mixed martial arts. These modern day warriors fit the male conception of traditional masculinity. Their sport requires strength, power, aggression and unmatched intensity as crucial to ultimate performance. -[exhaling] -[thump noises] [Santino] Yet many fighters are switching to plant-based diets. Is this a contradiction? Why have they made this choice? [crowd cheering] Can a vegetarian or vegan be as masculine and tough as a meat-eater? To find out, I went straight to the source. [commentator] Judges score this contest 30-27 on all cards for a unanimous decision for the winner, Aaron "A-Train"... I've been vegetarian for a little over five years now. And I dip into being vegan as much as possible. I was definitely vegan when I went into training camps in, in the later, um, years of my, of my training and in my career. So I've known Aaron for a long time now, obviously in both stages of his, uh, nutrition. You know, uh, when he became plant-based, yeah, you know, you saw the transformation in his body. He had no fat on him, he was ripped, you know. And, and looking at his UFC fights, he was going in there, he was in better shape. Although I do eat meat, I cut it way back and I-- I definitely-- you know, my intake of green leafy vegetables and everything, kale shakes and across the board, I incorporated that a lot more into my diet because of him. [Aaron] The primary reason for me cutting meat, animal products out of my diet was solely a compassionate choice. I could no longer justify eating animals and, and-- and contributing to, you know, the slaughter, taking animals' lives just for my own greed, in my opinion. I felt like it was something that wasn't explained to me as a kid. I didn't realize that I could live this way and definitely as an athlete. I was sold this myth that, in order for me to be a, a high-level athlete, I have to eat meat. I must eat animal protein, I need that in my diet several times throughout the day and that was gonna help me, you know, reach my goals of being one of the best. [panting] Once I realized that I didn't need that, once I saw there were some other athletes out there that were competing at a high level and winning, then it made more sense to me and I was able to make that transition over and cut meat out of my diet. My wife Kendra was a vegetarian since college and she knew my love for animals. But made a decision then too that I was not going to... bother him about it and make him you know, kind of be nagging. And hoping that in the back of my mind, he would slowly kind of see my way as the right way. With eating meat and killing, I feel like that's a learned habit. And it's-- And with our kids, they, they were very kind and compassionate from the get-go. So it just made sense to them when we started teaching them about why we don't eat meat. We wanted them, you know, to be okay in their skin and understand that, that we don't kill animals for a reason and that we love animals and we love everyone, we're just-- we just wanted to be kind to everybody. [Santino] Erin is one of the most gentle and compassionate people I have ever met. He is also clearly masculine. His diet hasn't changed that. But who says men are the only ones who can be fierce, strong and tough? [audience cheering] [commentator] Ooh... I am Hurricane Heather Jo Clark and I'm a UFC Straw weight. If I were to describe the way I eat, it would be mostly vegetarian, but there are occasions that I go full vegan. And those times are usually during fight camps. I think because of Heather Jo Clark's unique diet I think she probably pays more attention actually to the specific nutritional needs that she needs in her diet. And I think she comes in here and performs just as well as anybody else. So I support her completely in her decision and I totally understand why she wants to do it. [Heather] Yeah. I don't agree with how they treat animals. You know, I'm a big animal lover. God boy. It makes me wanna cry. Like, it really, really hurts me. I think the attributes that make Heather, uh, a good fighter is that she's tenacious as hell and she always wants to learn. She's never satisfied. [crowd shouting & cheering] It speaks for itself. I'm strong, I'm powerful. I've been, you know, a fighter for eight years, and I'm doing great. I have knockouts. [crowd shouting & cheering] Look at all the other vegetarian/vegan athletes out there. I think we're all proven to everybody you don't need to eat meat to be all those things. [crowd shouting & cheering] [Santino] Heather definitely doesn't need meat to be tough. But is it needed to be dominant? [announcer] Jake Shields! I'm Jake Shields. I'm a professional mixed martial arts fighter. I've held multiple world titles including Strikeforce, Shooto, Rumble on the Rock and number one ranked UFC fighter. And I'm currently fighting for World Series of Fighting. [announcer] He stands six feet tall. Also weighs 170 pounds, fights out of San Francisco, California by way of Mountain Ranch, California. Presenting Jake Shields! [Jake] I was raised vegetarian. My parents became vegetarian, uh, in the early 70s. So, for me, I was just born and raised this way. I always grew up liking animals and so as I got older and started be able to make choices for myself, I just, uh, you know, I liked animals and it seemed kind of gross eating meat. And then when I started looking into it more and seeing how they actually treated the animals at the factory farming, how disgusting it was and what a cruel policy it was, I decided it was something I wanted just to, to stick with. [shouting] [Jake] You know, yeah, being young growing up, everyone always told me, "If you want to be strong and be the best, you gotta eat meat to be strong." But it's just something I never had a problem with. I've always felt very strong. Everyone that trains with me always, you know, mentions how strong I am. I never feel overpowered. [clanking noise] [crowd shouting and cheering] [referee] Stop, stop, stop. [commentator] And that was smart. And this was-- [commentator] ...and I was there when he took on GSPN-- [commentator] That's it! That is all in Vegas. [commentator] We've seen this so many times now. [commentator] Bas Rutten, you cannot follow the cobra down the snake hole when that cobra is Jake Shields because he will make you pay. [commentator] Oh, oh, this time it's indeed. [man] Jake, Jake, Jake! [commentator] That's it. That is it! It is all over[indistinct] [commentator] Welcome to the World Series of Fighting, Jake Shields. [announcer] Jake Shields! [Jake] It's just great to prove that wrong, you know. I wanna be an example to show you don't have to eat meat to be strong. [Santino] It was once said that when Jake gets a hold of his opponents, he's a cement blanket, almost impossible to overcome. Good luck challenging his masculinity. But fighting, although masculine to some, is artistry to others. [grunting and groaning] My name is Alex Caceres and I am a mixed martial artist. I would be doing this whether it was in backyards, whether it was on the streets, wherever. To me, it truly is an art of self-expression. [calm guitar music] [Alex] To really see who you are when you are in these certain situations, because that's when the truth comes out. [Santino] Cheers. What do you do with it? [motor humming] Well, everything-- I, I don't like to waste anything. So all the stuff that I juice, all the-- all the remains from the juicing, they're gonna go into my soil pile and compost pile, so that they can break down and turn into new soil. [glasses clinking] And I use this and I just dump it into my soil bucket. I don't like the terminology. I don't like titles too much. I don't even like the title "plant-based." I don't even like the title "vegan." I just like to say, "I eat plants and I only eat plants." [calm guitar music] [Alex] You have to build yourself from the ground up and building yourself from the ground up, it's a discipline in all of your life. When it comes to training, when it comes to the things you do, think, and especially through the things you eat, diet and nutrition plays a very important role. Ever since I've been on a plant-based diet, I have never felt stronger. [Alex] These animals all hit a wall, especially the way they're raised and slaughtered and butchered and distributed. Never will I ever again perceive that I'm going to hit a wall or reach a plateau. The mountain has no end and I'm still playing, which is the beautiful thing about this. I'm here with the winner, Alex Caceres. You looked like you were having fun in there. I was, man. Not bad for a vegan, huh? [chuckling] Not bad at all. [Santino] Around the time I went vegan, Mac Danzig won Season 6 of the ultimate fighter show. Watching Mac succeed proved to me that I could be a strong and healthy vegan. But Mac's true strength and masculinity lies in his compassion. Good to see you, man. [man] You guys ready? Well, an easy way to describe the way I eat is vegan. Um, another way of saying is plant-based or whatever, you know. You can use any of those terms. But basically I'm relegated to being a consumer in this day and age. I don't have the ability to hunt and gather or whatever, you know, like some hypothetical thing that people, you know, may have done before the Industrial Revolution in different parts of the world. Because I'm a consumer and I-- everything that I do contributes to this giant empire of, of money-making, er, like the least I can do is make compassionate choices. Before I even ever made the decision to go with the vegan diet and lifestyle, I, I was working on an animal sanctuary, er, farm. It's, it's like a farm sanctuary in Pennsylvania where I used to live at the time. Through doing that, I was able to really gain a better understanding of not only like how, how awesome these animals were, but also how bad it was for these animals that had gotten rescued from really bad situations. I always knew that, uh, it was wrong and I-- and I think I just turned a blind eye to it, "Oh, well, it's not convenient. And, well, I can't do it because I'm trying to be an athlete." So there never was a moment other than that time when I finally decided to try it. And then I did in a month or two down the road of doing that, I was like, "Wow, I feel great. I feel fine." [commentator 1] He's timed out. He's got him tight! That's it! Danzig dominates Tommy Speer for the victory! Mac Danzig is the ultimate fighter! [commentator 2] A full right knee to the jaw of Mark Bocek. He lowered his head a little bit too much and got caught with a knee. This could be the finish. Mac got under the neck! -[commentator 1] Looking to finish the fight. -[commentator 2] It's a wrap. [commentator 1] It is all over! Mac Danzig chokes out Mark Bocek! Oh! And it is over! [commentator 2] Joe charging in. Look at that. Perfect timing. It's amazing. He was moving away as he-- [Mac] Being able to reach this many people and have this many people come up to me and say, "Hey, you were the reason why I had the confidence to actually go vegan and I had wanted to do it for years, but..." Being able to know that I've, I've touched that many people and I never once shoved it down anyone's throat, I just led by example, it feels really good, you know. I never had intended that. All I intended was first and foremost for me to control the only person that I can control and that's myself, and I was gonna control what I ate and I was not gonna, you know, live my life contributing to those industries. [Santino] As one of the first plant-based fighters, Mac has led the way for other fighters, including esteemed amateur boxer Cam F. Awesome. Cam fights in the 201 pound division for the U.S. men's boxing team. He is a five-time USA national champion, four-time Golden Gloves national champion and two-time Olympic trials champion. [crowd cheering] Since I've become plant-- a plant-based boxer in 2012, I've become faster, I've become stronger, My recovery time is so much quicker. I don't get a sore any more. It's completely changed my life. Because after I got into the, the plant-based world, I realized what was happening to the animals, what we were doing to the animals, how they were treating the animals and what we're putting inside them and then consuming ourselves. [man] Come on. [Cam] I do believe there's, there's a certain type of energy that, that comes from your food. And if the last thing your food did was cry for its life before you ate it, I don't think that's gonna be the greatest energy in the world to put into your body. [Santino] These are some of the toughest, fiercest and arguably, most masculine athletes. Yet their compassion for animals serves as their common motivation to be plant-based. At first, this pairing may seem like a contradiction, but now I see their compassion encompasses their masculinity. They are united in their desire to stand up for the weak and the voiceless. What is going on in the food system that inspires compassion in all of these fighters? What are the practices that affect the most frequently consumed animals? And how can animals live a peaceful life? To me, factory farming really is an attitude that sees animals as commodities, not as living, feeling creatures. And there's no respect at all for the well-being or the lives of these animals. [Santino] It may be uncomfortable to accept, but animal abuse is the norm, not the exception in the animal agribusiness industries. Nearly all of the animals that are raised for food are done so on factory farms, they are not on old MacDonald's farm out in the pasture. They are confined to a cage or four walls. In the egg industry, laying hens are put in cages so cramped that they can't spread their wings. They live in these cages for their entire lives, immobilized, laying eggs day after day after day. They suffer in a state of chronic pain and chronic stress. In the pork industry breeding pigs these highly intelligent and social animals, are locked in cages called gestation crates. These crates are two feet wide, and the pigs can't even turn around. At most, they can take one step forward and one step back. For milk production, cows are forcibly impregnated, and their calves are taken away from them immediately at birth. But the cows have to have a calf every year to be productive because they only lactate when they have babies. And then the cow, after her baby is taken away, goes into the milk production system. She is hooked up to milk machines two or three times a day. She's pushed to produce about ten times more milk than she would produce in nature. She is worn out after just about three or four years in production. Whereas in a healthy environment, these cows could live 20 years. And then when they are no longer profitable in milk production, the dairy cows are slaughtered usually for ground beef. [Santino] In the veal industry, calves are taken away from their mothers at birth and put into veal crates. Veal creates are similar to gestation crates. The calves can't turn around, their muscles atrophy, And they have a hard time getting up. They stay in these crates for four months until they are slaughtered. For meat type chickens, they've been genetically bred to grow twice as big and twice as fast as normal. And they grow so fast and so large that their hearts and lungs have a hard time supporting their growth rate. So every year you have millions of these birds that die of heart attacks at just a couple weeks old. The ones that survive end up at the slaughterhouse, where they're hung upside down on shackles by their legs, fully conscious, and then they go through the slaughterhouse assembly line where the first stop is usually an electrified tank of water where their head is submerged, which is supposed to render them paralyzed. The next part of the slaughter line, which is the blade that cuts their throat, it usually hits the mark and they bleed to death, but sometimes it misses. And then the next stop is the scalding tank where they're boiled. So you have every year millions of these birds that are boiled alive. [hens clucking] And then after that, they are de-feathered and processed into chicken products. [Santino] Truly the best day of these animals' lives is the day that they're sent to slaughter, because it's the day that their misery finally all comes to an end. [calm guitar music] [Gene] Here at Farm Sanctuary people get a chance to come and look in the eyes of a pig, or another animal and get to know them as individuals. We also try to model a certain kind of relationship here, one that is based on respect. And human beings are social animals and are influenced by others around them and by other examples that they see. We felt it was important to address the problems with animal farming. And so we started visiting farms and stockyards and slaughterhouses to document what was happening. And we would find living animals literally, literally thrown on piles of dead animals. And so we started rescuing them. And the sanctuary just grew and evolved. We didn't really have this long, big long term vision of creating these farms and this huge organization. We just started trying to help individual animals that needed help. And one thing led to another and we were responding to different needs. We want people to connect with these animals, see them as living, feeling creatures, recognize that they are not that different than cats or dogs or us. They just want to enjoy life. [music fades out] [calm guitar music] [Santino] As I'm in the thick of marathon training, I realized that I love running, because it challenges me to be a better version of myself. [panting] [Santino] I want to know more about elite plant-based athletes to take this approach. How do these various unconventional athletes all reach the same conclusion about diet? [cheerful music] [Santino] I'm with professional endurance athlete Hillary Biscay. She has finished 66 Ironman Triathlons to date and is the 2013 Ultraman world champion. An Ultraman is an endurance race consisting of a 6.2-mile swim, 261.4-mile bike ride and a 52.4-mile double marathon. My current diet is yeah, completely plant-based. To me, there's really-- there's no difference between, you know, my three puppies at home and the hamburger on my plate. To me, that's all, it's all animal. So if I'm not gonna eat my puppies, I'm not gonna eat that cow either. It's just-- it's that simple, really. It took me quite some time and a good bit of trial and error in order to get the plant-based diet completely dialed. But once I did, I actually had my best races ever. I felt lighter, stronger, I recovered more quickly, and my body could endure over the long haul better than ever before. There's never been a moment really, since I made the decision, where, um... where I have like seriously considered going back to my old way of eating. My athletic career was such this tiny, tiny, tiny thing, it was so unimportant when I really thought about like the big implications of what I was eating. [Santino] Speaking with Hillary gave me some perspective about compassion. If she needed meat to succeed, she would rather quit her sport than contribute to factory farming. After meeting with Hillary, I had the opportunity to talk to one of the true legends of skateboarding, Ed Templeton. [upbeat music] [rasping and scraping sounds] For me, finding skateboarding was the antithesis of sports. You know, I think in '85 when I started, the people who were finding skateboarding, I think, were alienated kids, we were just nerds. Before I found skating, I was just like a kid running around trying to be a ninja. Skateboarding opened this whole community up to me. I never thought it was a sport. It ended up being a lifestyle. So we did this grueling tour, thirty demos in 30 days across the U.S., you know, full-on road Warrior tour. I decided for this one month I'm gonna just go vegan. Why not? I'll try it for a month. Did this road trip and was, you know, got back and thought, "Okay, the month is over, I don't have to be a vegan anymore and I opened the bag of Cheetos, and ate one, you know, fluorescent orange and I ate one and just instantly felt like, "What am I doing?" So I read about slaughterhouses and that was the real moment, you know. I mean it's like reading this stuff, it's like learning fire when you're a kid. You know, it's like you stick your hand in that and it hurts. I'm not gonna do that ever again once you learn about the slaughterhouses. For me, it was like that's it, like you can't go back. You know, if I was on a desert island, uh, survival is number one. If I had to hunt to survive, I would probably eat and then I'd kill and eat an animal. It's like survival is number one. I don't live in that world. I live in this world. I live in Orange County, California. I walk into a store and it's overflowing with choices. And so I have the luxury of saying I don't wanna eat animals. [Santino] I relate to Ed. When I learned about the harmful effect of meat on health, I couldn't turn back. Likewise, once Ed learned about factory farming, he couldn't turn back. I guess once you know, you can't not know. [calm electronic music] [Santino] What wisdom does competitive bodybuilder Torre Washington have to offer? When I was young I was really into comic book characters Wolverine, Superman and how their physique was so shaped. I even started to draw them. I could draw them freehand just looking at the picture. And me sketching that kind of looked like as being a sculptor. So now I figured, "Hum, how can I sculpture my physique in that way? Then, lo and behold, I ran into see Arnold Schwarzenegger. Seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger in person, ripped, muscles everywhere, just like I was looking at these comic book characters, I was inspired to say, "Okay, how can-- I can do that. I can basically do the same thing in a different manner. And create the physique, or the superhero physique of my own." So I was raised vegetarian by my mother who was of the Seventh Day Adventist way of life. And this religion talked about living off the land that God provided as Adam and Eve lived in the garden of Eden. So this health message was to benefit us health wise and our interaction with the animals and this Earth. And then I took it to the next level and became vegan. And on this part of the journey I learned more about the connection with animals and the connection that we have with this Universe. As a vegan athlete or vegan bodybuilder, competitive bodybuilder, Some of the most fulfilling things that I had as part of the journey is-- When I'm competing, backstage people were-- a lot of them or other athletes were, "You-- you're that vegan bodybuilder? Man, how do you look like that? We've gotta talk because I'm so tired of eating chicken. If I cannot eat that and look like that, I'm all in." My tactic of being vegan was, when I came to the stage was just-- I just want to compete. Yeah, I was vegan but I wasn't thinking, "Oh, I'm vegan but to show you guys up." Now I can do more than just compete for me. I can do more to compete and help other people realize that, "Man, I don't-- I don't wanna loose muscle, I can get shredded if I want to, I can have a six-pack abs, and eat fruits, vegetables, plants, nuts, seeds. That's, that's amazing." What we are doing is changing that visual perception. [calm music] [Torre] Yeah, as a vegan you see a chicken in a cage, that touches your heart, like, "That's not supposed to be happening." I'm happy to change that perception, I'm happy to provide a different outlook. So when someone says, "Man, I've never seen a vegan with a muscle." Well, let me show you somebody. Here you go. Those things inspire me to continue to be better. You know, I'm better, better-- provide better information to do things to help, because we live in a world too much me and not enough we. [plane engine buzzing] [wind blowing] [engine roaring] [man screaming] [Santino] Heights are definitely not my thing. So how did I end up in that tiny-ass plane? Blame Steph Davis. Renowned climber, BASE jumper and wingsuit flyer. She's the first woman to summit all the peaks in the Fitz Roy range in Patagonia, the first woman to free-climb a Salathe Wall on El Capitan and the first woman to climb the Diamond in Colorado without ropes for protection. How's it going? Me too. [Santino] More than her athletic accomplishments, I'm drawn to her philosophy on life. [Steph] My sports are a very high commitment and a lot of times there's really no margin for error at all. [wind blowing] So it's important to me to always be performing at my top because my life is in the line. [flapping sound] I think some people hear the word "vegan" and think about all the foods they're not going to eat. [laughs] And so, when I say it's a whole foods plant-based diet, suddenly your mind is filled with images of vegetables, and fruits, and grains and, uh, legumes and it's like a lot of things, it's not about leaving things out. With the vegan and plant-based whole foods eating way, realized it was helping my performance. That was the whole idea, right? That's why I started this. I was saying, "Hey, how can I climb better and be stronger and healthier and do my sports better?" That was the motivator. And then I started to, um... I started to get exposed to information that I hadn't been exposed to before just through being busy, not having my eyes open, whatever. I'm embarrassed to say it, but I didn't know about factory farming. [chuckles] I mean, I'm-- I'm embarrassed, but I didn't. And then, when I was eating vegan, stuff was coming across my desk or my consciousness. When I saw that, it's like, um, you know, "I don't even care if I wouldn't be climbing better, I will not support that. That's just horrible." I'm very pragmatic in how the world works and I see in my society the way the world works is when you spend money, you vote for something. You put the dollars in and you now told the system that that's gonna get support. So I don't purchase things that are made from animal products. My whole goal has been to remove as many of my dollars from supporting factory farming as possible. [metal clinking] [upbeat music] The thing that tortures me the most is seeing human beings hurting other creatures. And I just can't stand it. I want every creature to be left alone, to live a natural, peaceful life like it wants to. [plane buzzing] [wind blowing] [wind blowing] Holly shit! [indistinct chatter] [man] There you go. [people clapping] It's awesome. Definitely see how small you are in the grand scheme of things in this earth. [Santino] Sometimes leaping into the unknown may be terrifying, but definitely worth it. Awesome. [clock ticking] [upbeat electronic music] [birds chirping] [Santino] I've come a long way from eating eggs, chicken and steak on repeat. Sure, I was told to eat my vegetables like any other kid, but I didn't realize how much, nor did I know the variety of plant foods out there. I know now that my ideas about nutrition were pretty flawed. I can remember how alarming it was when I first learned the statistics. And they haven't changed that much today. In the United States, three out of the four leading causes of death, including heart disease, strokes and certain types of cancer, are closely related to our food choices, as are other chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. In most cases, these diseases are preventable through diet. Yet the United States remains in a health crisis. Each year, heart disease causes one in every four deaths. Two and three adults and one-third of children and adolescents are considered overweight or obese. Medical experts are estimating that, by 2030, half of the population will be pre-diabetic or diabetic. Strictly going by the evidence, when you think about what does the medical evidence, what do studies show, what are the most disease-promoting foods that are out there, I would say right at the top of the list is probably processed meat. And we eat a lot of processed meat. And processed meat is bacon, hot dogs, it's sausage, it's salami, it's deli meats that people perceive as being healthy. Right below that, I would put red meat, which is very closely linked with heart disease and diabetes and early death. [Santino] In October of 2015, the World Health Organization released a report stating that 50 grams of processed meat a day increased the risk of cancer by 18 percent. 50 grams is equivalent to eating two slices of bacon per day. When you eat animal foods and animal protein and that gets into your intestine, the saturated fat that comes only in the animals opens up the cells in the lining of your intestine and it lets in these toxins called endotoxins which create the inflammation in your body. And that sets off a domino effect which could create inflammation in the vessels going to your heart, inflammation going into the vessels anywhere else in your body. The first step is even for doctors to even realize that food is medicine, and realizing that what we choose to eat and what we put in our bodies is as powerful as many of the drugs that are out there and surgeries that are out there. So that's the first step. But I think once people start to realize that, we're gonna very quickly realize that, well, if food is medicine, what food is the best food and what food is the best medicine. And again, I think there's broad consensus that plant foods are what promote health. [Santino] Research studies conducted worldwide suggest that well-planned plant-based diets are associated with fewer strokes, better cognitive function, less heart disease, lower blood pressure, less obesity, less diabetes, less colon cancer, less prostate cancer, and improved sexual function. When you're eating plant foods, you are getting these antioxidants that fight inflammation, you're getting all kinds of electrolytes which take away the acid in our blood. You're getting vitamin and nutrients. You're getting certain amino acids like glutamic acid which isn't found much in meat, but in plants. It actually goes into your blood and helps dilate your blood vessels so that you don't get high blood pressure. And so these plant foods are like perfectly packaged. [crowd cheering] [Santino] When I played football, I ate meat for performance. But that choice could have caused my underlying health issues, for the majority of my symptoms went away after a year or so on a vegan diet. Are there elite athletes who eat plant-based for performance? What about for health? [indistinct chatter] My name is Griff Whalen, I'm a wide receiver. I played college football at Stanford University. And I've been in the NFL for seven years now. [crowd cheering] The way I eat is a vegan diet, completely plant-based. But more than that, I try to focus on eating whole foods and eliminating processed stuff as much as possible. [upbeat music] So, Griff and I met freshman year at Stanford, really right before freshman year starts at football camp, you know, and you're sort of wide-eyed freshmen. We decided to room together for the next three years at Stanford. Griff had a terrible body when we first met as freshmen. He's gonna get mad at me for saying this, but he had a-- Really it was terrible, he had like a potbelly, it was really funny. But he definitely didn't look like that like he does now, way back then. Originally I turned to a plant-based because I was looking for every edge I could get, everywhere I could be a better athlete and a better football player. And I worried, and how's he gonna get enough protein, is he gonna-- How's he gonna survive, he's gonna fizz out after, you know, three days of practice in a row. And as a friend, you obviously want him to be able to do the best that he can do. I, I probably was a bit surprised by how, how well the diet seemed to affect his body. He's always the most in-shape guy, you know, if he'd go forever run routes all day. He's known on the team for being one of the fittest guys. It's worked for him. After having him explain things, you get it and you get why. [panting] [Griff] It's always been my dream to play football. But my whole football career, I've been the underdog. I've either been too short or too small or too slow. When I became vegan, in a lot of people's minds it only made me a bigger underdog and put me at a bigger disadvantage. Like how the hell am I gonna compete at the highest level if I'm not eating meat, eggs or dairy. But where people thought I would fall behind I actually took huge strides forward. [calm guitar music] When I transitioned to my plant-based diet, I noticed a ton of benefits, both immediate and long-term. Immediately I felt faster, lighter, and just more energetic all the time. And then over time, I noticed less soreness and arthritis in my knees and ankles and also I just got stronger, I felt like I could go all day. Eating a plant-base diet has changed my life in a big way. I've become very passionate about health and nutrition. Just constantly reading, learning as much as I can. I love talking to people about their views on it, and I don't necessarily push my views on anybody. But just love having conversations about the things that I've learned. [Santino] Griff proves what I never thought could be possible. He uses a vegan diet to perform in his top in one of the most physical sports on the planet. Now it's time for me to meet up with a familiar face. [sportscaster] Ended up here now. Donavan on the ball, lets it across to Husidic! Preposterous, Husidic! Another for the Galaxy. And yet another assist for Landon Donovan. My name is Baggio Husidic. I'm a midfielder for the L.A. Galaxy and I'm a professional soccer player in Major League Soccer. When he got there, uh, it was great. He was an instant, uh, improvement to our team in a lot of areas and also just another good guy that people liked to be around in the locker room. And I think he had a fantastic first year. I think when you win a championship with, uh, with a team, that's always a success and, and he was a big part of what we did. So it was great to have him. My diet is whole food plant-based. I've been doing it for-- for a while now and I've seen a significant difference in my performance and my whole lifestyle. I've been playing now for the L.A. Galaxy a year, almost two years. And I can say that I covered the most distance on the team, I recovered faster than almost all the players. It's crazy to say this, but I still think that sports are pretty far behind as far as diet goes and nutrition and these things. There's still a lot of people who after training go to McDonald's or go get fast food and-- and think that that's an okay way to treat your body as a professional. What I tell people all the time is that if you own a Lamborghini, you wouldn't put 87 octane fuel in it, you'd put 91 or you'd put even better if you can. And that's what we are. We are-- we are highly tuned, finely tuned athletes and you have to treat yourself that way. So when I first realized that Baggio was vegan and-- and only plant-based, um, I thought it was great. And when you have examples like Baggio who are successful, I think that's good for everybody. [sportscaster] ...the side of the area, plays it through the 6, Husidic, Scores! [crowd cheering] [sportscaster] ...away. They're showing the beauty. What a goal from Baggio Husidic. Lift off for L.A.! I was always a very fit soccer player. But for some reasons, 75th, 80th minute I used to get cramps in my calves and I couldn't figure out what the reason. I always thought it was because of dehydration. And then the next year I went to a fully plant-based, no meat or dairy at all, and my cramps completely went away. Eventually I started digging further into it and exploring and I stumbled upon this video of a, of a grandfather who said something that really touched my heart. He says something in the words of, "When I got older, I didn't wanna-- I didn't want my grandchildren to come to my house and watch me sleep in my bed or walk around on a crane. I wanted to be able to jog around and play with my kids." And that's, that's who I wanna be. I don't wanna be, er, old, weak person. I wanna be a vibrant, healthy old person. You! Peek-a-boo! You want some milk? I've known Santino since high school. He was a football player, bold, pretty mean-looking, very Italian dude. At that time in my life I had no idea about nutrition and what was good and what was bad. We started working out with Santino, my brother and I, and that was the first time, first time I realized the importance of nutrition. Because of him, my thought about food and what you put in your body slowly started to change. It wasn't radical, it wasn't quick or anything, but that was the, the moment I realized what I put in is what I get out. That was the, the start of me becoming ultimately a plant-based athlete. Eating a plant-based diet, I believe, it's the optimum way to, to eat. I feel great now and I wanna continue to feel great when I'm older. And I wanna be able to be happy. And I think ultimately happiness comes with being a healthy person. [Santino] From one pitch to another, I'm headed to speak with Toni Pressley about her recent switch to a vegan diet. [upbeat music] My name is Toni Pressley, and I'm a professional soccer player for the Orlando Pride. I decided to switch to a vegan diet because last season didn't go as planned. Uh, I gained weight. I was struggling with my performance and my confidence. So in the offseason, I really buckled down with my fitness. I buckled down with my nutrition. Seeing Toni's transition to a vegan diet is actually very positive. I feel like she took the proper steps and not just cut cold turkey from her previous diet, and I think she's talked to the right professionals about it. Um, because I think that's very important to really understand the transition, especially being an athlete. I feel like you need to feel-- fuel your body with the proper nutrients and, uh, nutrition to be able to perform at your best. So I think that her sitting down with our nutritionist here, and, uh, professionals really helped her on that positive path. I see her happier. Um, I obviously see her healthier. And then as a player, she's performing really well. The main change that I saw my body was the loss of weight. Um, losing 20 pounds was huge for me because I was able to move around the field and feel better on the field, get my fitness where it needed to be in order to perform at a higher level. I'm sticking with it. And I've seen that, you know, I can thrive at a high level with this diet. [upbeat electronic music] Tony transitioned to a vegan diet I would say a year before me so I got to see kind of her experience and how she was feeling through it and just-- I feel like the confidence in her performance just continues to elevate just her level on the field, continued to improve throughout that year and I was like, "Wow, maybe I could do something like this as well". And so I think she was just a massive help for me because I was able to kind of see that right in front of my eyes and see someone just crush it on the field. And realize that, you know, "Maybe I could do the same thing, and maybe I can cut animals completely out of my diet and still perform at the highest level." I decided to transition to a vegan diet mostly because of the fact that I have a pet dog, Blue, who I absolutely love and I just had this sort of guilt that I felt like the animals I was eating were similar to... [chuckles] to Blue, so in that way I was just like, you know, I feel like I just wanna cut this out. So I started slow at vegetarian and then I went vegan. And I feel amazing on it and I just feel a lot more free. The biggest thing I didn't wanna see is just a drop in my energy, and I haven't seen that. If anything I felt like I've had more energy because of it and I feel like I've also seen a very positive effect on the field as well. [crowd cheering & shouting] [Alex] So when I initially went vegetarian, I was trying to cut out diaries and eggs as well throughout my diet, but Tony was a huge help, and I think just kind of watching her and learning a little bit along the way, helped. So when I went to that vegan diet and Tony started doing these prepared meals I was completely onboard, I wanted immediately to, uh, have her create these meals for me to see what she was cooking. So I kind of learn how to cook vegan as well, because I felt like-- Before my meals always were meat and then the sides around it. I didn't know how to cook without meat in it. So it was very new to me but, uh, Tony was just the support system I needed. [upbeat electronic music] [Tony] As an elite athlete, nutrition can make or break you. It can control your performance. It can control your recovery. It can prevent injuries. It can help you with your sleep. And, you know, it's something that I personally have invested in, and I've seen dramatic results. [crowd shouting and cheering] [Santino] One of the things I love about running is that it's accessible. You could put on your shoes, find a track, hit the sidewalk through the streets and go for a long run and really be free. For me, running is parallel to veganism. It makes me feel healthy, happy and really alive. [Santino] I haven't done intense training like this in almost ten years. I personally am not planning on reviving my athletic career. But can a plant-based diet help stage a comeback? [sportscaster] Wearing the blue, also representing [indistinct] please welcome Chris Campbell. My name is Christopher Lundy Campbell, and I competed in the sport of freestyle wrestling in the college wrestling team. He was one of those guys when you turn the lights on, he was just that much better. And if you analyze it, he lived a pretty good lifestyle. [Chris] When I decided that I really wanted to be the best of the world, I started looking at what diets would work best to germinate my body. And that's how I came to become a vegetarian. [crowd shouting] [commentator] And Chris Campbell of the United States gets the first point-- [Dan] He was a smart guy, and he already was ahead of a lot of people just in understanding of what it takes to live a long life and what it takes to be really good and to get your body to be, uh, working the right way. [sportscaster] This should be an interesting match-up, Campbell, a reigning world champion making a comeback-- So I've taken off about four years, four, five years when I came back. Now, most people who come back can't do it after about four or five years. Wrestling is really hard. But I really think a vegetarian diet was really the key to it. [sportscaster] This time he's impressed with how his body has held together 36 years old. There he gets it on his favorite technique-- I hadn't developed the problems that usually people get after they don't compete for a while. That wasn't there. My body was limber because I was doing yoga and I was still training. But more importantly, I don't think it was clogged up with all the meat. I think I was second in the nation, my first year. And then the-- after that, I won the nationals, I think, for two years, after that before the Olympic, the Olympic Games in '92. -[reporter 1] And you can see the way-- -[reporter 2] Oh, boy, Campbell takes but that's gonna do it. So the match ends with a minute twenty-one to go. [presenter] Will you please welcome, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Dan Campbell. [Chris] Then I was Olympic bronze medalist and I'm the oldest American to ever win Olympic medal in the sport of wrestling. And I do think that my diet had a lot to do with it. [Santino] All of these athletes fuel their careers with plant-based diets to achieve ultimate health and performance. But what about more pressing circumstances? [Santino] I'm with Rich Roll. Rich is an ultra-endurance athlete perhaps best known for completing five Ironman distance triathlons on five islands of Hawaii in a week. I am plant-powered and by that I mean I eat a whole food plant-based diet, 100 percent plant-based. The main reason that I started exploring dietary habits was due to a health crisis. I was 39 years old and at the time I was your typical overworked, overstressed, uh, guy working 80-hour weeks in a, in a corporate law firm. I was 55 pounds overweight. And everything kind of came to a head when I had been working late and came home, my family was asleep and I was doing my favorite thing. After finishing my beloved bag of cheeseburgers, I decided it was time to go to sleep and I was making my way up this staircase right behind us. I had to pause halfway up a simple flight of stairs. I honestly thought that I was on the precipice of having a heart attack. I realized that I was gonna have to make some, not only significant changes but very specific changes. I mean the weight just came right off. The 50 pounds gone, I had so much energy, I resumed the fitness program, just a casual one and just reconnecting with my body and loving how that felt. [calm guitar music] The endurance community really seems like the first athletic community to jump on board the idea of eating a plant-based diet for performance. There is a very, very strong focus, maybe more so than there has been traditionally in other sports on recovery. How can I expedite recovery in between workouts? [Santino] Eating a plant-based diet may indeed improve recovery for athletic performance. The fuel that our body runs on is called ATP, or adenosine triphosphate. ATP is made by our mitochondria and our cells. When you eat foods like beets, dark leafy greens or tart cherries, you can improve the efficiency of your mitochondria, making more ATP, more fuel to help your muscles recover. [Garth] So what's going on, what's making these people feel so fantastic? It's the anti-inflammatory effect of it. So there's several reasons for this. One of them is you're not eating the inflammation anymore, obviously. The other thing though is you're also eating a lot of antioxidants, a lot of phytonutrients, you're getting all your vitamins and nutrition. You're getting fiber that's cleaning out your body. Uh, and, people talk about how, just how light they feel on a plant-based diet. And for athletes, trying to get away from inflammation is crucial because the workouts they're doing create inflammation. And so if you're eating a plant-based diet and you're taking away that inflammation, you recover quicker, you could do more work at your next workout and work out more often. [Santino] It's clear that plant-based eating is good for health and athletic performance. I can attest to this for I feel my endurance is improving and my recovery time is accelerating as I train for my marathon. But what about the health of the natural environment? How does diet impact the natural resources that sustain us all? [calm guitar music] Although I became vegan for health issues, once I learned more about the vegan diet, I was moved by the profound impact human dietary choices have on the planet. This knowledge in part, led me to finish my bachelor's degree at Arizona State University in sustainability and pursuing my master's at NYU in environmental conservation. I love the natural environment much in the way I love running for the simplicity and freedom it provides. To discuss how food choices affect the planet, I'm on my way to visit with fellow environmentalist and professional surfer Anna Ehrgott. [calm guitar music] [Anna] Being a surfer and spending so much time in the water has given me a connection to the natural world that I otherwise wouldn't really have. And getting to see all the elements align in a way that's so beautiful and so orchestrated really shows me like how small we are in comparison to all that and how powerful that world is. Come here. I went vegetarian when I was six years old. I was in second grade and I just kind of hit me what I was doing that I was eating these animals that I had made a connection with, and it just didn't feel right. Like I didn't feel comfortable killing a cow, so it didn't seem any better to be paying somebody else to do it for me. As I got older, I started looking into the environmental concerns regarding animal agriculture and just realizing what an impact that's making on our waterways, on our ocean, on deforestation and realizing how big of an impact our small choices with what each person is eating has on the environment. [calm guitar music] [Anna] All the wastes from these factory farms is ultimately draining into the water systems going downstream and running into the ocean. And it's a huge pollutant for surfers, for fish, for up to the food chain to dolphins and sharks. All of these fertilizers are kind of waste from cows and pigs and everything like that are causing algal blooms which take oxygen out of the water and make it so surfers can't be out there. I wanted to see from a personal level of what I could do to stop this, and ultimately it's my food choices that I felt I could make the biggest difference. Just cutting out animal products and eating close to the land, eating locally has been, I think, the biggest factor in eliminating those algal blooms and all the pollution running into the ocean. I think there's so much degradation in the environment right now that we just don't have enough time left to think everything is these separate entities. We have to realize that everything we eat, all our daily choices, plastic use, all our disposable products, every bit of clothing we buy, all the chemicals we are using, it's all interconnected. You know, like they say, reduce, reuse, recycle. But I also think we need to like add another one of just refusal of not buying disposable products, of not buying animal products because we don't need them. [calm guitar music] [Anna] Food can either be our medicine or it's gonna be ultimately what makes us ill. And the funny thing about that is what's good for us is also good for the environment. So that's organic, local and cutting down on meat products. [Santino] After visiting with Anna, I'm making my last stop. I figured what better way to talk about diet and the environment and to train for a marathon than to meet up with ultra-marathon legend Scott Jurek. [Christopher] Scott Jurek was this giant looming shadow over the entire world of ultra-running. This is a guy who shows up at the premier event, The Western States 100. This is the Super Bowl of ultra-running. Shows up as a young guy, not only wins it, but then comes back year after year after year, seven years in a row, he consecutively wins this premier event. How you can go through a 100-mile race every single year, show up on game day, ready to go strong and healthy, not sprain an ankle, not have an upset stomach, not have a bad headache against the entire population out to get you, is amazing. [upbeat guitar music] [heavy breathing] [water slapping and splashing] [panting] [wind blowing] [sizzling food] When I first became plant-based, I was really scared about like chronic disease. My mother had multiple sclerosis. I was working in hospitals seeing... people's lives destroyed by disease. And I thought to myself, even somebody who's young and healthy and an athlete, I wanted to change the course of that. See, I came from a, I thought, well-educated sports background. I thought I knew a lot about sports performance. But one thing I did not understand was nutrition. And this is something that Scott really opened my eyes to. I thought he was kind of a weird outlier. I thought, "Okay, this is more like a hobby, and he's getting away with it, you know, more like it wasn't helping him, but luckily it wasn't hurting him too bad." [Santino] If there's any remaining doubt as to whether an athlete can succeed on a plant-based diet, look no further than Scott Jurek. In the summer of 2015, Scott became the fastest person to finish the supported through hike of the Appalachian Trail. He averaged nearly 50 miles a day, crossed 14 states and traversed over 500,000 feet of elevation change. [Scott] The Appalachian Trail is one of the longest, toughest trails out there. People take five to six months to hike the whole entire trail. It's, you know, 2,100 miles of just really badass, you know, rocky terrain. So for me, I really wanted to throw myself into that, and really test, you know, my limits and just put myself on the edge. And that's what I think I've tried to do as an athlete is to find that strength when I least thought I had it and just dig a little bit deeper. When I was approaching the summit of Mount Katahdin, it was really almost like flashbacks of all kinds of different aspects of my life, you know, all the difficulties I've been through. You know, I thought about my mom constantly when I was on the trail, when I didn't think I was gonna continue, that I didn't think I could make it. It wasn't just breaking the record, it was getting to the end of that trail because life is a lot like that. It's about getting to the end and just putting your best effort forward always. And then as an athlete who spends a lot of time in the wilderness, who, you know, traverses mountain ranges and, you know, spends a lot of time in the woods, for me, that environmental component seemed to make more and more sense. You know, if I want to enjoy these wild places and continue to see them in the way that they are as well as passed them on to generations down the line, I wanted to make sure that I left the world in a better place. And diet just again, you know, seemed to point in that direction of less impact. How can I live as low as possible to the ground and make my impact less and less? To produce animal foods, you need vast resources. So we have water that is being used. We have aquifers that are being drained, we have rivers that don't reach the ocean anymore. Rainforests being cut down to create more pasture land and more cropland to feed more animals, more corn and soy. So we are squandering scarce resources. We are polluting precious resources. We are potentially impacting our own ability to survive on this planet. [Santino] To put in perspective the resources utilized to raise animals for food, consider the following statistics. It takes roughly 520 gallons of water and 4.2 pounds of grain to yield one pound of chicken meat. It takes roughly 1,849 gallons of water and 32 pounds of grain to yield one pound of beef. It takes roughly 720 gallons of water and 11 pounds of grain to yield one pound of pork. These numbers reveal the resources required for only one pound of meat for three kinds of animals raised on factory farms. The implications of this data exponentially increase when considering that. Over 9.2 billion animals were slaughtered in the US alone in 2015. Mass amounts of animals produce mass amounts of toxic waste. This waste is pulled into open air pits known as lagoons. Some lagoons are larger than seven acres and contain as much as 20 to 40 million gallons of urine and manure. [water running] [Santino] Lagoons contaminate drinking water and pollute the air with gases containing harmful chemicals. Animal agriculture also plays a significant role in global climate change, yielding some of the highest amounts of the most potent greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The United Nations talked about how animal agriculture contributes more to climate change than the entire transportation industry. So it's really good the people are changing the way they drive or they're changing their lightbulbs or doing various things. But the single more important thing we can do is to shift the way we eat. And eat plants instead of animals. [Santino] Like me, Scott Jurek became vegan to protect his health. But then I understood the greater consequences of diet. It makes sense because Scott has a direct connection to the land, by nature of his sport. By getting on the ground level and running within these humbling natural landscapes, I now realize that being vegan was not just a different food choice, It was key in cultivating my connection to the natural environment that has shaped the life that I lead today. [traffic sounds] [clock ticking] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [announcer] If you are post-race poncho runner and have a lime green label on your race number... [tense music] [heartbeats] [announcer] Welcome to New York! There is no better reason to celebrate this great city than running the TCS New York City Marathon. On your mark! [gunshot] [crowd shouting] [upbeat cheerful music] [Santino] I'm at mile eight in the New York City Marathon. At this point, I think I'm Scott Jurek. Sixteen miles later, I am definitely not Scott Jurek. [upbeat cheerful music] [indistinct announcements on megaphone] [people cheering] [Santino] Hey, that was probably one of the hardest things I've ever done. I'm so happy I finished. I mean it's, uh, New York City, it's the biggest party of the year here, so... Being in New York for the past several years I've witnessed this and just now being a part of it, it's, it's an incredible experience. [Santino] I wanted to push my physical limits on a vegan diet. After running this marathon, I can honestly say that I recovered faster and have more energy -than when I ate meat. -[woman] Awesome. [Santino] This journey has allowed me to learn from some incredible people. They've shown me how to be compassionate, healthy and environmentally conscious. You're good? You see that? [inaudible] [Santino] As I run down my dreams and toward my future, I take with me the knowledge that the simple choice of what food I eat has the greatest impact. [upbeat music]
