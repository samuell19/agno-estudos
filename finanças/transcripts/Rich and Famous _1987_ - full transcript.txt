RICH AND FAMOUS Executive Producer Charles Heung Wah-Shing Executive Producer Johnny Mak Planning and Screenplay by Siu Yeuk-Yuen Starring Chow Yun-Fat, Alex Man Alan Tam Andy Lau Pauline Wong Carina Lau HuoJun-Hung Yeung Kwun Special appearance by Danny Lee Also starring Shing Fui-On, Ng Hoi-Tien, Fan Mui-Sun Directed by Taylor Wong Between 1949 and 1953, 2 million refugees fled to Hong Kong from Mainland China. The result was an exponential growth in Hong Kong's population. Therefore, in 1953, both sides agreed to a blockade, thus ending the citizens' freedom to cross the border. Excuse me, sir. Is Lam Chiu Sang here? He's over there! Thanks. That sick bastard, waking us up every night with his damn coughing. When will you move out of here? Chiu Sang. Chiu Sang. Chiu Sang! There goes another one. That's his son. Might as well take him with you. Come. Add another one! Bravo! You fucking fool. Are you nuts? You'll break your back! The 350 m race is about to start! Ready, and...go! Leading the dash is No.1 , followed by No.6 and No.4. Reaching the curve now. It's a tight race between 1 and 4, with 4 closing in fast! Now it's 1 and 6... 1 and 6 and 4... 6, 1 and 4! Crossing the finish line! It's 4, 6 and 1 ! The winner for Race 4 is No.4, followed by No. 6... Brother, let's go. Kwok, I'm rich! I've won more than $200! And with the $7.90 dividend, that adds up to $1,500! Then let's go. I've already bought food. No way. I'm feeling lucky. I'll go for a few more races. Don't bet anymore! You go home first. I'll get some more food later. You better come home soon. Otherwise, Pa will know that you're betting on dog races again! Got it! What are you looking at? Pay up! Something's not right with your ticket! My ticket? Four eyes, I think there's something wrong with your glasses! Better go get a new pair tomorrow. How dare you forge your ticket like this? Hey! Watch your mouth! Kwok! Come back and save me!! KWOK!! Come on! Let's go! What the hell? Come back here! You have to pay for my fruit!! I'm here, brother. Uncle Ken wants to talk to you! You've owed us $1,200 so far. And you haven't paid in months. Now you even forged your ticket! Do you know Brother Chai's rule on this? The penalty for forging tickets is cutting off fingers. I have a proposal. I'll swear that I won't cause any more trouble at Brother Chai's joint. Is that a deal? Can I say something? Speak. Uncle Ken, our father works as a coolie. He's hurt himself lately and was coughing up blood. Because of his illness, we're now in heavy debt. Even my cousin has to work as a bar hostess. That's why my brother did what he did. Oh, really? You may be a nitwit, but I admire your loyalty. Sit down. You owe us $1,240 in dog racing. Add $2,000 for the damages, $3,000 for my boys' medical, and a $3,000 "apology banquet". Grand total is $9,240. You have ten days to clear this. I... I'll pay. I promise. Since you've already lost all your dough, here's $200 for a nice dinner with your dad. Thanks, Uncle Ken! Uncle! Wai Chui, you're back early today. We had a big spender tonight. He treated all the girls to steak at the Hilton. Want to guess who he was? Who? It's Brother Chai! Brother Chai? Lee Ah Chai? That's him! Wow,jackpot! Then why're you home so early? Why not stay with him a bit longer? He was with a friend, a fat man from Thailand. He wanted me to spend the night with him. But Brother Chai came to my rescue. He told him that I'm having dinner with my family. That's why I could leave! I feel sorry for you. A gift from Brother Chai? Nope. It's from Hilton. By the way, a friend of mine owes Brother Chai money. Can you ask him to extend the due date? I hardly got to talk to him. I'm not even sure if he would recognize me. Yung, are you the one who owes this money? Of course not. I promised you I'll cut off my fingers if I bet again. Kwok, come and help me out. Have you decided? They're drug traffickers. It's dangerous to mess with them. Kwok, even if you don't care about my fingers, you should at least think of Pa and Wai Chui. You...you guys...you guys better watch out. Those traffickers have guns. In fact, I'll be very worried if I don't go with you two. But they recognize my face! I'm a dead man if my boss finds out about this! I have to be extra careful just meeting with you guys. "Gutsy" Ying! Boss is looking for you. I'm not slacking off, Brother Snake. Then what are you doing here? Conspiring with your buddies to steal boss' money? You're...you're kidding, Brother Snake. Of course I am. Think you're as gutsy as your name? "Gutsy" Ying. Yeah, right. You earned that nickname for the opposite reason. How can you make it big, with that stuttering of yours? Brother Snake, hav...have some mussels. My treat! Sure. Look at you! You're sucking on an empty shell! I like to suck the juice. Sir, let me take it for you. Excuse me. Thanks. I'm sorry. What are you doing? What is it, pal? That's my briefcase, kid. The briefcase is mine. That is yours. You tell me, coolie. Between me and this kid, who is more likely to own this brand name briefcase? I'm just a coolie, not a psychic. But I know for sure that briefcase ain't yours. Keep it down. Customs officers are coming. Forget it. Freeze! Drop that briefcase. I have a silencer on my pistol. You better watch your back. My boys are watching. They won't be as quick as my gun. You won't dare. There're too many cops here. Wanna bet? I'll shoot you dead on your fourth step. I dare you. Hey, you cheated! You said you'll shoot on my fourth step! But that was only my third! You don't keep your promise! Freeze, fatso! I have two pistols pointing at your butt. Put your gun away, or I'll blow up your fat ass! Do it! I've already put the gun away. You should keep your promise. Would you like to travel by plane or by cruise boat? By plane, of course. How can you not take the plane in this jetset age? But accidents might happen. Uncle said that planes do somersaults in mid-air! They did it on purpose, just like the principle behind Tai Chi. The plane is flying so high, and there is no ground support. Right. And the wind is blowing hard. So the pilots have to do somersaults to ease off the friction. Don't worry. There are seatbelts. And the plane will balance itself out. It's very safe. But what if the somersaults happen while we are eating? The trays and dishes will be flying all over! Silly girl. They have instruments that tell them when to expect the wind. They'll only serve food when there's no wind! Let's order our in-flight dinner now. My dad must have dishes from his native Chiu Chow province! Going on a trip? To the Philippines? Singapore, Malaysia, and THAI LAND! Damn fatso! Over there! Forget the elevator! Take the stairs! Are you alright, fatso? Let's split! Watch out for their guns! Get them!! I can't run anymore! HELP! Kwok!! Save me!! Kwok! Kwok! Let her go! She has nothing to do with it! Take me instead! I'll go with you!! Let her go!! Kwok, don't go. Kwok! Wai Chui! Wai Chui! What happened? You want to go see Brother Chai like this? What else can I do? They might kill Kwok if I don't go. He only met you once. Are you sure that he'll help? Welcome. I'm here to see Brother Chai. Please. Is Brother Chai inside? I'm from the club. Chai, if I didn't save your old man's life, you wouldn't be here today, right? Right. Uncle Fan had been most kind to me. Then let's drink to it! You're no match to me when it comes to wines. But you're pretty good with guns. You come to Thailand, and I'll bring out my automatic. You'll end up looking like a beehive! Even 10 Lee Ah Chais can't touch me! You're late, baby. Get lost! I thought you said you're quitting?! Maybe you don't have the hearts to leave your old man, girl! Stop pretending that you don't drink. Bottoms up! Uncle Fan, a toast to you from me. Bravo! Drink that too! On behalf of my late father. You sure can drink! Why are you only talking to him? Is it because I'm not as handsome? I'm jealous. I'm mad! Miss! What happened? I got stabbed. Sorry, Brother Chai. It's alright. You came here to see me? Big Eye, call the doctor. You'll be fine. Don't worry, pretty girl. I'll call my Thai troops and bomb them all! Brother Chai, we are all from Chiu Chow. Please save my cousin. I think you should stay out of this. It was wrong of them to snatch Old Chu's goods to begin with. Brother Chai, Old Chu is back at his antique store. There aren't too many of us Chiu Chow folks here in Hong Kong, but we are pretty united. Don't you worry. I'll help as much as I can. We are all family. His cousin is brave enough to trade her life with his own. We can't just let him die in vain. Old Chu had been pretty arrogant lately. He no longer gives me the same degree of respect as before. I know he'll take me on. Fine! I'm going to take this on. I'll teach that asshole a lesson. We'll see what he has to say about it. Brother Chai, releasing the kid is not that simple... Tell him I'm not here. Old Chu is not here. I can't make the decision. I'm going to be frank with you. I'll pay for the lost goods. If anything happens later, you can talk to me. But I want the kid released now. Respect! Brother Chai, I'll respect your wishes. I meant MY respect, you dumb ass! But then our Big Brother will lose respect. Please don't give small potatoes like us a hard time. Big Brother will be back in a few days. You two godfathers can sort things out by then. You must be joking. I'll end up retrieving a corpse. My chauffeur is on his way to your place. Please have him at the front door in 15 minutes. Screw him. Act tough! Brother Chai, do you think you run the show around here? Old Chu said no! No! I mean...I am saying no! Old Chu, I know you're listening. No need to eavesdrop like a peeping tom, you bald turtle. And you call yourself Big Brother? Turn the lights on and take a look at the consequences for not letting him go! Are you cold? How about some hot coffee? We've still got ten more minutes. Beat him up. Wait here. There's no way this thing can't be solved. My superior had already called. Old Chu will give him respect. It's time for Old Chu to learn a lesson. He deserves a slap on the face from Brother Chai. Otherwise he wouldn't know when to quit. - Thanks, Officer Hau. - Don't mention it. Goodbye. Brother Chai! My God. You're badly hurt. - Big Eye. Call Doctor Wu right away. - Yes. Bring him over here. Be careful. Have a seat. Is he a mute? No, he's not. That old Shanghai bastard burnt his tongue. Get well. Don't worry about the medical cost. If you like, you can come work for me after you recover. He'll be fine, Brother Chai. He's just overcome with joy. Kwok. Kwok! The meeting is over. Now get ready! Brother Chai! Must be sincere. Brother Jai, I... My name is Mak Ying-Hung (means Hero). I'm their buddy. I feel happy to learn from you, just like how they're learning from you. Happy... Big...Big...Big Brother! No. Big Jai Brother! Brother Jai, I'm Mak Ying-Hung! Mak Ying-Hung? Welcome aboard. Brother Jai! I'm happy that you're learning from me. No...Sorry. You're happy...no. I'm happy...You learn from me... You're happy... Brother Jai. I learn from you...I'm not happy! Thanks. Learn from Uncle Ken. I blew it. It's fine that you blew it. But don't drag us down too. I referred you. Now you've made us lose face! You know how allergic my nose is. It acts up when the weather changes. - Please explain to Brother Jai for me. - It's Brother Chai, not Jai! Kwok! Don't be like this. Brother Chai won't get upset over such petty things. I'm so useless. How could I sneeze at a moment like this? He must be mad. I should've covered my mouth. How rude for me to sneeze straight onto his face! - It'll be fine. - There goes my future. You two, go and collect some debts for me. Me too? Sure. Are you coming? Remember. You have to act tough when collecting debt. But all we want is money. So don't hurt anyone unless it's necessary. Ying-Hung. Go and collect Desert Boy's debt. By myself? Try it. Pay for your drink! What're you looking at? Pay? I'm here to get paid for the dog races! I really don't have it. I won't have it even if you kill me. Is that so? You listen to me, Desert Boy. Have you heard of the famous "Gutsy" Ying? That's me! Cousin! Come out quick! Somebody wants to slaughter me! Cousin. This "Gutsy" Ying wants to slaughter me. Dear Cousin. Your cousin owes our Brother Chai money for months. You dress well and look like the reasonable type. Wouldn't you agree he should repay us? He has no money to pay. So you're the famous "Gutsy" Ying? Then go ahead and slaughter him. Come on! Slaughter him! Sorry. Cousin, my nose is very allergic. What's going on, Ying-Hung? He said the only way they'll pay is to kill Desert Boy. Well, Western boy? Are you going against us on behalf of Old Chu? What do you mean, Uncle Ken? I was just getting myself a herbal drink. We're just fooling around with your boys. But we scared him pretty good! I have about $400 in the drawer. You can have it. Brother Chai! Brother Chai, can you give Ying-Hung another chance? Mak is not suitable for this line of work. It has to be inborn. He won't advance even if he tries. Teach yourself some other crafts while you're still young. But you're different, Kwok. Keep it up. This deal may very well be a trap. I suspect it's a ploy by Old Chu to get me killed. This is your chance to shine now. - Luk. - Yes. You stay guard outside. Yung, go and help Luk. Don't make any decisions while I'm not there. There's $1 million in this briefcase. Brother Chai, are you going to Macau too? Sure. Why not? Promise us you won't get on shore. Don't worry. I'll wait for you on board the ship. After we're done, I'll treat you all to dinner at Pinocchio. Just dinner, though. No girls. Okay. Let's go. Kwok, let me carry the briefcase. I'm used to carrying briefcases anyway. But Brother Chai said you should stay outside. You have to adapt once you're in the real world. Brother. Big Eye and me can handle this. Do I look like the chicken type? Fine. Keep your mouth shut when you're inside. I'm not the talkative type either. This way please. Should I check on them? Not yet. Tang Ka-Yung. Lam Ting-Kwok. We're here on behalf of Brother Chai. I expected to see Chai. Why didn't he come himself? We're sorry, but Brother Chai is not feeling well. He has a high fever and diarrhea. So he sent me here to apologize. If General needs anything, feel free to tell me. It's the same. All three of us are the same. Did you bring the money? It's all here. But Brother Chai promised me that he'd come. This is disrespectful. I have to postpone the deal. We've brought the money. Postponing the deal will be going back on your words. You're not qualified to talk with me. I'll write a letter for Lee Ah Chai. He'll understand when he reads it. What is this? - Danger! - No! Don't shoot! I'm on your side... - Where's the briefcase? - Damn! Kwok! Yung! Kwok! Are you alright? - Brother Chai! - It's Brother Chai! Go! Kwok! Kwok! Yung. I've told you not to go inside. Now everyone is hurt. Are you happy now? I don't even know whether Kwok's going to make it. You're always acting like a wiseass! Showing off to get noticed! You'll screw things up sooner or later! You're not going to be here long if you don't change! Doctor Wu, how is he? His condition is no longer critical. - He'll be fine. - Thanks! Brother Chai. I didn't lose the briefcase. I know. Doctor Wu said you have a strong body. You'll soon recover. I took two hits here 5 years ago too. I'm still here. What was in your mind when you're shot? I thought, what a waste of my life to die a virgin. Uncle Fan! Sir! We can't let you in unless you're wearing a suit and tie. - Get me a tie then. - But... Get me a tie! How's this? I've been looking for your ass for weeks! Every time I called your office, I was told to "Wait a minute." Then they told me "Sorry, but he's just left." I went to your home, and they told me you're in Brazil. Finally I found you here, enjoying your lunch. But not before being jerked around by that fucker of a waiter. - You're something else! - Sir, what would you like? Nothing! I had three bowls of beef noodles on the street before I came here! I tried not to let him in. Keep an eye on him. I'll call the cops if necessary. I'm here to officially inform you that Interpol had issued warrants for the arrest of that Thai drug kingpin Fan. You know, the one you've been hiding? I hope you'll cooperate and turn him in. Because I'm in charge of this case. I think you're getting the wrong information. I think you still don't know who I am. My nickname is "Iron Shovel", because I'm known for shoveling trash! Officer Cheung, why don't we shake hands and be friends? I want to make friends too, but definitely not with your type! I know you're famous. You've never gotten promoted in the 8 years since you graduated. You'd been transferred to 7 districts, and 12 of your superiors complained that you're uncooperative. Officer Smith said you're mentally ill, and recommended that you be transferred to a mental ward. Am I right, Officer Cheung? That's none of your goddamn business! They tried to expel me because I wouldn't take bribes like they do! And the ward proved that I am mentally sane, moron! I knew about you too! You're a smuggler, a drug trafficker, and a loan shark! You may look like a gentleman, but you're actually full of shit! Mr. Lee, is he disturbing you? Sir, this is a private, high-class place. I'll call the cops if you keep misbehaving like this. Save it! I AM a cop!! You're good! And you! You're even fucking better! High-class? So wearing a tie means you're high-class? Mr. High-class, turn him in or get your ass prepared for jail! Really? Then let's see who gets it first. What are you looking at? Brother Chai. He's a mad dog. Think of a way to drag him away. Please come in, Boss. Uncle Fan, how are you feeling? Chai, it's dangerous out there. You shouldn't come to see me. I've brought your favorite brand of cigar. I could smell it even before you walked in the door. But this nurse is very strict. She wouldn't let me smoke. Since when did you listen to women? Here, have a smoke. You're the best. Still has the heart to visit an old fart like me. Chai, you should know how well I treated my friends. I never cared about money. I helped whenever I can. Look how they treat me now... like a leper. They don't even come near to me anymore. You know how important it is for me to have face. I can't believe I'd be humiliated in my twilight years! Uncle Fan. Yes? Thanks. Do you know that the patient shouldn't be smoking? He's showing symptoms associated with blocked arteries. Smoking can increase his chance of having a stroke. That serious? Nurse. This here is our big boss. Big boss? Do you know that he has to remain calm? Why do you give him cigars to smoke, and make him cry like a baby? Do you want to kill him? Please don't do that again. This nurse here is Ying-Hung's cousin. Can she be trusted? She's a good friend of both Yung and Kwok. Is she Yung's girlfriend? Just friend. Ying-Hung! You're so late! How's your insurance job? The moment they heard that I'm in insurance, they acted as if I'm about to beg for money. - Uncle Kit. - Ying-Hung. I kept remembering how foolish I was that time, sneezing straight onto Brother Chai's face, and too scared to collect the debts. But it's different now. I'm much gustier now. I can dash in and out of traffic with my mopad, no fear. You don't believe me? - I'll show you! - I don't believe it. Come on. I'll show you. You just watch. Watch me. That's gutsy alright. Bravo! See? I'm okay! Not a scratch! Po Yee, I was just kidding. Kidding? Who do you think I am? Tang Ka-Yung, you better behave yourself. You and I are just friends. Cousin. Yung told me you really like him. So that's a lie too? I don't like him at all. All he knows is to take advantage of me. Not to mention acting like a big shot with his big mouth, and fooling around and thinking he's a handsome hunk. I know what kind of a person he really is. Hiding his ruthlessness behind that smiley face. Yung! Yung! Didn't you say that the nurse will be here? She'll be here. Girls need extra time to dress up, when it comes to meeting Brother Chai! It's all twisted! Brother Chai, thank you so much for taking care of Kwok and Yung all these years, and hiring Wai Chui to be your housekeeper as well. Thanks to you, we're living a comfortable life. Come on. Po Yee! Why so late? I just got off work. Brother Chai is waiting for you. Brother Chai insisted that you must accept his invitation. He's watching the opera over there. Brother Chai...Brother Chai. Remember Uncle Fan's nurse? She insisted that I bring her here to see you. Where is she? She's chatting over there. Brother Chai! I've found out why so many bosses were not here. They're meeting at Old Chu's place to boycott of us, and to force you to turn Uncle Fan in. They've even asked Godfather Hung to intervene. Let's have a meeting now. Old Chu, backed by Godfather Hung and other big bosses, is asking me to meet with them at Godfather Hung's place. Any thoughts? No doubt they're planning to put me on trial. We'll sacrifice Uncle Fan if we have to! You're nuts. You don't give in just because you're outnumbered. When you're bargaining, you have to ask yourself if you're being reasonable. If you are, then you stay firm. If they insist on flexing their muscles... Then we'll show them who's really in charge. Alright. I'll be the devil's advocate. Godfather Hung, the opium king in Thailand is a lifelong adversary of Fan. He's offering a $500,000 reward for Fan's head. And he wants us to turn him in. Otherwise he'll shut off his supply to Hong Kong. Now, our Brother Chai here has hidden Fan from sight. So we went and ask him for mercy. And all we got was, " Heh heh, it can't be THAT serious!". If our drug supply is cut off, there'll be no more work for my boys. Then what? Can you, Brother Chai, guarantee us that you'll feed them instead? "You won't feel the pain of a needle until it's under your skin." Brother Chai is famous for not dealing with opium. My business dealings with Thailand are now history as well. Brother Chai, cut the bullshit. Of course you don't care about those petty business. That's not true. Even though they're petty, they're vital to us! Maybe Godfather Hung should say a few fair words about this. Looks like Brother Chai will only listen to Godfather Hung. Chai, it's your fault. My fault? Why did I stay firm on my position until this day? That's because Uncle Fan saved my father. And, during the worst two years of my life, Uncle Fan was unconditional in his support. Fine. Today, this old man has nowhere to go. He trusted me enough to put his life in my hands. If I betray him, then I'm no longer Lee Ah Chai! How will I ever face the altar of our God of Kwan? Right, that's right. Loyalty is right. When it comes to business, you are the buyers, and Thailand is the seller. If they cut off Hong Kong, they'll end up worse than you all. They wouldn't last long. How can they be a threat to us? Old Chu and I have some personal animosity. That's why he's been trying to put you against me. Out of my respect for Godfather Hung, I won't hold a grudge. But whoever that tries to get Uncle Fan... I swear in front of our God of Kwan, that I'll personally take his life! No more bickering, you all. I'll be the judge of this. The most important thing is to stay united. It's right for Brother Chai to keep his word. And it's also right for you all to make money in business. Motherfucker. Don't know whose side he's on. Brother Chai, you're really great back there. Your speech almost made them want to salute you! I really have to learn from you from now on. Po Yee always crack a smile whenever she mentions you. I'm going to be the matchmaker for sure! Have you finished? What were you babbling about back there? I was only trying to help. What did you mean by saying that business is also vital? Were you implying that Uncle Fan's life isn't?? How dare you conflict with me in a situation like that! People might think that even my closest people are not on my side. Then they can come and crush me! - It can't be that serious! - Shut your mouth! It's useless to keep kissing up to me. I've already told you once. Not only did you not change, you've gotten worse! Starting tomorrow, you'll watch over the bars in Sheung Shui. Don't come to see me unless it's something serious. Pa, this is your last bottle. Don't drink anymore. Here. Have a cup of tea. I made this special brew just for you. What are you looking at? I'm admiring your battle scars. Gunshot wound again? If it is, I would've gone blind already! I got scratched while playing soccer. I thought it was due to some heroic deeds. Still, if it wasn't for me chickening out, and sneezing into Brother Chai's face, we would be fighting arms to arms by now! Take that Macau incident. I would've watched over that briefcase for you. No way would I have forgotten to take it. Here's your tea. Kwok, with your status now, can you tell Brother Chai to give me another chance? I'm a different guy now. My nose is cured, and I'm as gutsy as I can be. I even tried roller skating on the rooftop last week! Brother Ying-Hung! Long time no see! Well? Still stu....stuttering and s...sneezing lately? Can't take a joke? I was just kidding with you. I need to talk to my brother. Kwok, come with me. How are you, Pa? I'm stuck. I've been in rural Sheung Shui for three weeks now. I'd rather hang myself!. Brother, don't be like that. It's only temporary. Wait til Brother Chai calms down in the next few days. I'll go talk to him. Maybe he'll let you come back out! It's useless. He's prejudiced against me. Not true. Brother Chai is not that kind of a person. He likes you so much, of course you'll speak for him! He treats everyone the same. Be honest now, Kwok. Brother to brother. If I go against Lee Ah Chai one day, which side will you be on? - It can't be that serious! - You'll be on his side then! I didn't say that! Then you'll be on my side! Brother... You said it! Good brother! Here's $250,000. Thank you. Morning, George. Cassette radio. Good stuff!. It's for you. I'll go in and see Uncle Fan. Kiddo, I really appreciate this. You've made me feel confident once again! What did I do? This magazine you brought me is giving me a hard on! I haven't been this excited since my illness. I thought my manhood days are over! Why don't you take a piss to see if you're really excited? Kiddo, I'll show you. Don't be scared! How's that for size, buddy? Brother Chai. Hello? Lau? I just want to check Tang Ka Yung's personal saving account. I understand... I know it's against the rule. But I promise I'll keep this confidential. Fine. I'll wait for your call. Brother Chai! Horrible news! What is it? Haven't you heard? Uncle Fan has been murdered! How did you know? I heard it from the car radio on my way here. I heard it too. But they never mentioned the deceased's name and his location. Anyone could've guessed. Hello? That's me. I understand. Thanks. It was you who killed Uncle Fan. I killed him? Brother Chai, everybody out there wants to take his life. And you're saying that I killed him? Don't mean to offend, but I think you're being prejudiced. Lo San Hang offered $500,000 for Uncle Fan's life. The standard rule is one-third advance deposit. But knowing you, you'd have asked for half first. I've checked your account. You deposited $250,000 two days ago. Admit it now or I'll kill you right here! Yes, I did it. But I didn't do it for money. I have no problem sharing the money with you all. I did it all for you. We won't have a peace of mind as long as Uncle Fan lives. Fine. So now I become the designated bad guy. But wouldn't you admit that your troubles are over now? Brother Chai, say it from your heart. Did I really screw up? I no longer want to listen to your blatant lies! Brother Chai! Luk, what are you waiting for? Wait! Brother Chai, if you want to kill him, then kill me first! You get out. This doesn't concern you. I swore in front of God of Kwan that I'll kill whoever that kills Uncle Fan! I know. I know he's wrong. But he's my brother. I just can't watch him get killed. You tell me. How can I explain this to my Pa? Tell him that he's vanished? I can't lie to my Pa. Yung had betrayed me. If I don't kill him, how can I command my boys from now on? You tell ME! Think about it. Is he worth your help? Big Eye is not interested in my position. I've been considering you as my successor. If you insist on getting yourself involved, then I'll kill you both! You know me well. I have to stand by Yung's side. Both of you, get lost. I don't want to see you two ever again!! Get out! Brother Chai, I owe you. If you need me in the future, I'll be at your command. GET OUT!! I really admire you two brothers. I want you two to join my company. Brother. Did you ask him to come? Cheers! I have a plan. I'll let you two handle the illegal horse betting. By season's end, you'll both get close to $400,000. I won't go against Brother Chai! I've decided to go straight. Brother, let's go! Kwok! Stay right there! Can you? Once a triad, always a triad. What's done cannot be undone. Understand? Your attitude implies that you still hold a grudge. Which means you're obviously against me. Hey! You've gone too far! I've let you had your way since childhood. I always get beaten up just because of you! I stood by your side even though I knew you've done wrong. I would rather die for you and let Brother Chai down! And now you want to betray me!! What kind of person are you?? Can you keep your voice down?? I've had enough of you! Just because Chai adores you doesn't mean that you can treat me like a goddamn coolie! I'm your brother, not your boy!! Also, I introduced Po Yee to Chai, and you said I'm acting like a pimp. And now you humiliate me in public like this?! Do you still consider me your brother? I don't want to discuss our rights and wrongs in front of others! I may end up dead the moment I walk out of this place. Brother, you think it over. If you don't leave with me, then we're no longer brothers! Wait! It won't take long, pal. To be honest with you, I've always found Yung somewhat of a bastard. I still remember the day when Brother Chai expelled me. He kept badmouthing me to others and called me a sissy. He made a laughing stock out of my sneeze for years! Kwok! Let's go! Hurry! Go! Yung! Yung is coming! Go up there and hide in the engineering room. Don't come down until I come and get you, okay? Mak Ying-Hung! What's up, Brother Yung? Come on in. Not feeling well? Just a minor fever. That's why I'm here to check on you. Your hands are cold! Of course they are. Can't you see I'm holding an ice bag? Your girlfriend doesn't take care of you while you're sick? Nope. She's in Macau. You're up so late. Did you have visitors? Nope. No? Then how come there're two sets of dinnerware in the kitchen sink? Are you hiding Kwok? I don't know what you're talking about! I'm a single guy. It's not unusual for me to wa...wash dishes once every few days. That's nothing special. Smart. You're a lot smarter now. Not even a stutter at moments like this. And hardly a sneeze. Smart boy. Where is he?? Tell me now! Where is Kwok? I don't know! I'll give you three chances. Where is he? I don't know! Where is he? WHERE IS HE?? Time's up! Stop arguing, you two. I'll be the judge of this. We have to keep our word. Making money is more important than making a kill! Here, shake hands. Let's wipe away the hard feelings like wiping chalk off the board! Godfather Hung, what if somebody doesn't keep his word? I'll guarantee that person will have no place in Hong Kong. Unless it's over my dead body! Brother Chai. After what Yung had done, I don't feel it's right for me to work here anymore. Don't be silly. You have nothing to do with it. Actually, neither was Kwok. Who'll take care of my home if you leave? Am I that important to you? - Do you really want me to stay? - Brother Chai! Have some cake! I'll be content as long as I can serve by your side. That's good then. It's almond cake! I made it just for you. Smart girl. Smells good! Wai Chui, come and have some cake. - Right. Come on over. - Coming. Coming! Kwok! It's Brother Chai! Brother Chai! Congratulations, Brother Chai. Please give my best wishes to Po Yee. We are relatives now. I'm very honored, Brother Chai. I overlooked you. Now I know how loyal and heroic you really are. You saved Kwok's life. You are my friend. Come and join me later. Brother Chai, my nose is cured! Good night! Take care. Brother Chai praises me!! One's a wedding, one's a funeral, Old Chu. - Both will be funerals. - "Godfather Hung dead at 88." I'll kill Lee Ah Chai on his wedding day. He'd never expect it. Call "Jaguar" in Manila. Ask him to find us two professional sharp shooters to take care of this. On behalf of the Jesus and in the name of our Lord, I now ask in front of your relatives. You must both answer sincerely. Lee Ah Chai, will you take Lau Po Yee as your lawful wedded wife? I do. Lau Po Yee, will you take Lee Ah Chai as your lawful wedded husband? I do. Wait for me. I didn't expect you to come. Lee Ah Chai, you win. Thanks to you, I'm now transferred to border patrol. But I won't quit. One day I'll be back in town, and I'll personally arrest you then. Why are you telling me this on my wedding day? I deliberately chose today to tell you, because I know you won't beat me up here! Chai, come and meet my friends. Thank you for helping out. - Ying Hung! - Here! Po Yee! Over there! Yung?? Don't! Yung!! Get out of my way, you fucking chicken!! GO TO HELL! Call me chicken?? Go to hell! Chicken? Chicken? Die! Make fun of my sneezing? Sneeze this! You bastard! You cut off my finger! Here! You want to cut it off some more, don't you? How about biting it off? Here!! Bite it off!. Bite it!! Bite it off!.! Let her go! Don't shoot! You shoot and I'll stab her dead! Drop your gun!! Did you hear me?? Throw the gun to me. Throw it! Drop your gun now!! Do you think I'm bluffing? They're over there! Brother Chai, Brother Chai! Please don't shoot! - Brother Chai... - Please don't. I...I'm begging you... - Please...Let Yung go, for my sake. - Pa... Why are you still here, you bastard?? Go! GO!! Lee Ah Chai wants to kill me... You asshole! Lee Ah Chai wants to kill me! Bastard! Shut the fuck up! Po Yee... Lee Ah Chai, did you kill this person? I did it out of self defense. That's not my gun. Inspector Hau. It was self defense! How could you be a cop if you don't even know the basic law? Brother Chai, I'll recommend you for the Good Citizen Medal. Lee Ah Chai, you better not die too soon. I swear to God I'll lock you up with my own hands! Brother Chai! We're losing Ying-Hung! Watch her for me. Ying-Hung. I've never seen a braver and more loyal soul than you. You've saved our lives. I will never forget that. R....Really? Really. Cousin! - Ying-Hung! - Cousin! No... Kwok quits the underworld and retreats to Malacca. Chai promises Po Yee to end his triad ties. Now a wanted fugitive, Old Chu flees overseas. Yung is sentenced to six years in prison.
