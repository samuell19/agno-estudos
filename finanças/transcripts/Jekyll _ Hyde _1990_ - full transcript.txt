[MUSIC] NEWSPAPER MAN: Extra! Read all about it... Buy a flower, lovely flowers, penny a bunch, penny a bunch. Buy a flower. [STREET VENDOR YELLING INDISTINCTLY] Oye! Watch were you're going! Thank you, sir. 55, do I hear 55? Come along, gentlemen, these are no ordinary chairs. They've seen many a romantic evening. MAN IN THE AUDIENCE: 55. 55 over there. [AUCTIONEER TALKING DOWNSTAIRS] Sir. They found her. She's alive. - Found who? - Sara Crawford. - She's in Somerset. - What? - You're sure? - According to the police, she moved there five years ago. She changed her name, had a child, - the boy is growing up now-- - Kick them out. - Sir? - Stop the auction. But it's already started. Everything in this house belongs to Sara Crawford. Stop them before they sell another thing. Well, don't just stand there, go downstairs and kick the vultures out! This was Dr. Jekyll's favorite sculpture. - What am I bid for this excellent-- - Stop! Stop the auction. - This sale is now canceled! - AUCTIONEER: Canceled?-On whose orders? - Mine. Who the hell are you? I am the Executor of the Estate of the late... Dr. Henry James Jekyll. [SUSPENSE MUSIC] Get you roses her. Lovely roses. Get your roses here dear. - Yes, sir. Can I help you? - Ah! A Miss Elizabeth works here I believe? - Over there, sir. - Thank you. Yeah, she's looking good. Very fit indeed. Good work, Elizabeth. - I'll take him now. - Elizabeth: Thank you, sir. Sara. How are you, Sara? Are you well? It's me. Jeffrey Utterson. JEFFREY: I've been searching for you for years. Go away Jeffrey, leave me alone. Sara, wait. I've got something to show you. This is Henry Jekyll's will. JEFFREY: You are his sole beneficiary. He's left everything to you. His house, investments, everything he owned. I, uh, I was about to sell it. I don't want it. - Leave me alone. - But I... I hear you have a son now. - What of him? - Well doesn't he deserve a good start in life? SARA: You stay away form him. Not one word, not one word of what happened in that house you hear me? Or I'll kill you. Now leave me alone Jeffrey! Sara, what's happened to you? What's changed you like this? You know what happened to me. - My dear, I don't. - You saw him. - You saw him yourself! - Saw who? Hyde! Hyde? Hyde. [POLICE WHISTLE] POLICE: Come on, get it. Stop that man! POLICE: Stop him! Get that man! POLICE: Oye! Get hold of him! POLICE: Stop him from that way! POLICE: Don't let him get out of here! [HORSE NEIGHING] [WOMEN SCREAM] [PEOPLE MUTTERING] Is she dead? No, no, she's still breathing. Look, Dr. Jekyll's house is just down the street. One of you help me lift her, gently. Stand back. Dr. Jekyll? Dr. Jekyll! - What happened sir? - Ah, Poole, get Dr. Jekyll quickly. What is it, Poole? What's going on? Henry, we have an injured child here. I think she may be dying. A man just pushed her under a carriage. Most horrible human I ever saw. - She was just standing there selling flowers, he-- - Poole. Go outside and hail a cab as quickly as you can. - JEFFREY: Shall I come with you? - JEKYLL: No, Jeffrey. You go on without me. [BALLROOM MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Sir Peter and Lady Holston. - Ah! Hello, my dear. - Good evening. Peter, you old rascal, who's going to win the elections? - Annabel. - PETER: The Liberals. You're looking wonderful. - How are the children, are they well? - Disgustingly well. And it's about time you had some your own. Where is your husband? - Singapore. - Oh, what a shame. Doctor. Mr. Jeffrey Utterson. Good evening. You know my daughter, of course. - Of course. How are you, Sara? - Jeffrey. Where is Henry Jekyll? I thought he was coming with you? He's been detained at the hospital. A child was injured in the street. - But he says he going to come-- - Sara, I want you to come talk to Professor Elliott. Get me some chloroform, sutures, and a trephine. Find Dr. Loyd. - Poole, you wait here. - Right, sir. That was intolerably rude father. Jeffrey Utterson is a friend of mine. He's a friend of Jekyll's, you should not have invited either of them, I'm very annoyed. Sara dear, we were just saying how brave you are. Brave? How? By letting your husband loose in the far East, surrounded by sultry maidens.They don't allow maidens on board ships of the Royal Navy Annabel, sultry or otherwise. But he's so handsome dear and you haven't seen him for ages. Now I would call that brave in a wife, wouldn't you Dr. Lanyon? Father, didn't you want me to speak to Professor Elliott? He's over there. Oh... Did I say something wrong? It's an inter-cranial hemorrhage, Paul. There's no other way. But if you open up her skull she could die on the table. And if I don't release the hematoma, she'll die on the stretcher. Don't do it, sir, you'll kill her. Bring her in. Swab her down, nurse. [WHISPERING] I will save you. As God is my witness. I will save you. [BALL ROOM MUSIC CONTINUES] I just wanted you to talk to him that's all. This silly feud's been going on for more than a year. I won't have Jekyll in this house and there's an end to it. Why? Because he's disproved some of your theories? Damnation, your sister is dead! How am I going to forgive that? Forgive? What is there to forgive? Louise died of pneumonia, there's no cure for that. You know it. Sara, I am a past president of the Medical Council., please do not lecture me on medicine. Jekyll killed his wife just as surely as he'd buried her alive. Killed her? Father what are you saying? He loved her. He moved heaven and earth to find a cure.Just like a witch-doctor finds a cure. Experimenting with one treatment after another until she died. The only cure for that charlatan is a bullet in the head. Sara. Stay away from him, Sara. You're all I have left. Dr. Lanyon. Isn't this our dance? JEKYLL: Ready? Hold her head, Paul. Completely still. Trephine please. No movement at all. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [CONVERSATION INAUDIBLE OVER THE MUSIC] Swab? Suture. Now, Paul. Take her back to the ward and stay with her. All she can die off now, is an infection. But she won't, she's a winner. Look... Try dress the wound, give her plenty to drink and I'll see you again in the morning. Thank you. Good night. It doesn't matter, Sara, honestly. It does matter. My father snubbed you Jeffrey, I'll make him apologize. -You'll see. - Make who apologize? JEFFREY: Henry. How's the child? She's sitting in bed drinking hot milk, I hope. Oh, that's a relief, um... I think you should talk to Sara before you go in. But, eh, I'll bid you both goodnight. Goodnight. Am I too late for the Ball? - Henry, I must talk to you, my father's-- - Just a moment. That's not the last waltz they're playing is it? - Uh, yeas, but eh-- - No buts. [WALTZ MUSIC PLAYING] Goodness. How romantic. Goodnight, Sara. Goodnight, Dr. Jekyll. Sara, our guest are leaving. And you sir will oblige me by leaving now. DR. LANYON: You are not welcome here. Goodnight, Sara. [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [WOMAN LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] Leave me alone. No, no, leave me alone, please. Please, leave me alone. Oye, oye, oye, that's enough, you've got-- Leave him, Mr. Hyde, I'll deal with him. Go on, Lucy, get upstairs. Please! Please. You get what you are. Troublemaker, that's what you are.-Now choose a girl or go. - LUCY: Please! No! Please, please. Please. [LUCY SOBBING] Don't hurt me. Oh, please. [LUCY] Please don't hurt me again. Please. Don't hurt me again, please. Please don't hurt me. [LUCY SCREAMING] Right. Get out. No! Oye! Oye, you in there! Leave that girl alone! I told you once, now get out. WOMAN: What do you mean soliciting? Take your hands off me. I'm a good girl, I am, take your hands off me. WOMAN: Stop it, stop it. [SERGEANT] Right, you can all go. Go home. Well, Mr. Utterson? No, Inspector Palmer. I'm afraid it isn't any of these men. Pity. We though we'd got him this time. Perhaps you would favor Sergeant Hornby with your statement. - Certainly. - This way sir. Has this man committed crimes before? All over London. Arson, destruction of property. Last night, he walked up to a policeman and just broke his arm. Oh God. What, for no reason? Some of them don't need a reason, do they, sir? Well, do you think you'll find him? This is Scotland Yard, sir. We'd find him at the North Pole. After you. These then are the frontal lobes. The areas that shape the personality. And the brain works through a system of chemical messengers. So in theory, we can shape that personality in any way that we please. Your book says, "By the use of drugs." JEKYLL: I'm flattered you read it. But Dr. Lanyon says the opposite. He says our behavior is fixed at birth. We can never be changed. Dr. Lanyon is wrong. You drink six glasses of whiskey and see if your behavior remains the same.[EVERYONE LAUGHS] In this bottle, there's a fluid called Reserpine. The Indians use it to treat melancholia. People contemplating suicide have had their outlook completely changed. It's crude, but it works. So, chemicals do control the mind. Yes. Perhaps we should give some to Dr. Lanyon. [EVERYONE LAUGHING] All right, all right, that's enough.We're on Ward B in three minutes. - Sir, one more question. - JEKYLL: Yes? Dr. Jekyll. STUDENT: Can drugs be used to improve intelligence? -One day, who knows. And you'll be the first to get some. - [STUDENTS LAUGHING]STUDENT: Sir, in chapter three, you say we can eliminate madness. No, I say we can control it, by inducing the opposite. There's a difference. - Just by finding the right drug? - Yes. But, that's against the laws of nature. Surely. I can see you're a Lanyonite Stephen. You're going to take a lot of convincing. No more questions, off you go, Ward B. I asked downstairs, they said it would be all right. If it's about last night, it's my fault. I shouldn't have accepted your invitation. Henry, please listen. My father's been saying some terrible things about you. He doesn't still think I neglected Louise? He thinks you killed her. What? By treating her with untried medicines. He's been reading your theories about drugs and he thinks they're dangerous. That's absurd. She died of pneumonia, nothing on earth could have saved her. She was his daughter, Henry, try to understand-- She was my wife. - What kind of a man does he think I am? - Dr. Jekyll? What is it, Mr. Thomas? They're waiting for you in B Ward sir. Eh, I'm coming. Um, can we talk about this over dinner or something? I can't, not tonight. Or lunch. Lunch tomorrow then at the eh... - at the Cafe Royal. - All right. Henry, please be careful. - My father is a very powerful man. Right, gentlemen, follow me. This is the patient. She was admitted last night. Can you all see? She suffered a severe subdural hemorrhage. Requiring craniotomy and serosanguineous fluid evacuation of the Frontal-Parietal cortex. - Are you a doctor? - JEKYLL: Yes. - What gave me away? - That. Oh. - You're Victoria aren't you? - Vicky. - Can I look under your bandages, Vicky? - Yes. Excuse me, Dr. Jekyll, there's a reporter downstairs. - A reporter? - He says it's urgent. They can't. - Can't what? - Look under my bandages. Yes, they are a suspicious looking bunch, aren't they? You keep an eye on them until I come back. I will, don't you worry. Do I have the honor of addressing, Dr. Jekyll? Edward Snape, sir, London Record. - This will only take a minute. - What will? Mr. and Mrs. Wyatt are just over there, sir. - If you'll follow me please. - Eh, just a moment. - Who are they? - Oh, the grateful parents doctor. And very grateful they are too, if I may say so. Nigel! Now, sir, if you could just hold Mrs. Wyatt's hand while we talk, Nigel's going to get an artists impression for our readers. "Medical Hero Meets Distressed Mother." [YELLING IN HER EAR] This is the doctor what saved little Vicky for you. - How do you do, Mrs. Wyatt? - You'll have to speak up sir. - They're both deaf. - How do you do, Mrs. Wyatt? Now Doctor, what went through your mind as the child lay helpless in your arms. Well, I, eh... I knew that surgery would be necessary. - What's he saying? - Read it in the paper. Hmm... You know this will be too hot, I'll have to leave it. But the evening are cold aren't they, Ma'am? - Out there in the tropics. - Well, not according to the Captain. He says that Singapore is like a steam bath. [DOOR OPENS] Barbra, will you leave us please.Yes, Dr. Lanyon. Sara. Last week I brought a copy of that man's book into my house. Last night, you invited him to the Lanyon Ball. If you're talking about Henry Jekyll father, please use his name. But today you went too far. You visited a hospital for which I am personally associated for a public meeting with the very man who is trying to destroy my reputation. Oh, now you are being ridiculous. You are a married woman, the whole town is talking. You mean Annabel is talking? Sara, I want the truth. Has he seduced you? Is that it? How could you? Have you betrayed your husband with your own brother-in-law? Answer me? How dare you? You answer my question with a question of your own. So I have my answer, have I not? Father! Father! - Evening, doctor. - Good evening. - How is the child? - She'll be as good as new. No supper tonight, Poole, will you tell Mrs. Clark? Eh, I'm not happy with Mrs. Clark sir. She's the laziest housekeeper I've ever met. Not now, Poole, I've got work to do. Very good, sir. Eh, can I get you something to drink? No. And don't wait up. - Good night, Doctor. - Good night, Poole. [SCREAMING] [GROWLING LIKE A BEAST] [GROWLING CONTINUES] [SCREAMING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [LAUGHING WITH A BEASTLY VOICE] - Seen your local police? - Local police? Don't be stupid. Local police? They're useless. You know what they said? "You're in a dangerous trade." Dangerous? - How can I work? Look at me! - You wanted me Dennis? This lady thinks she's seen your maniac, Jim. There's no 'thinks' about it. Look what he'd done to me! That's his picture in the paper. Why don't you do something? Dennis get Inspector Palmer down here, now. Come on, miss. Come on, sit down. Come on you lot. Don't sit here all night. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] I'm telling you. Yeah. Governor. Behind me. It's him. It's the same man. All right, get the police, I'll keep him talking. Good evening, sir. First time in here? Oh, you can have a drink on the house aye. [EVERYONE SCREAMING] BARTENDER: Stand back! Stand Back! All right, everybody, all right now, calm down, he's gone. Calm down, sit down, come on get on with you drinks. Come on, Fred sit down. That's it, calm down, everybody, every-thing's all right now. [EVERYONE SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] And you're sure it's the same man? He lives there. His name's Hyde. And who is this posh friend? That's who pays his rent, I told you. - And what does he look like? - I've never seen him. - And he pays Mrs. Hackett. - Woman who runs the place. - Jim, you, me and Freeman, outside in five minutes. - Right. - What's you name love? - Lucy Fletcher. There's a nurse upstairs, Lucy. Get her to look at those bruises. God almighty! What is he, a man or a sewer rat. - Hey! Look what you've done to my door! - Where is he, Mrs. Hackett? I was bringing the key. - Look what you've done. - Where is he? I told you, he comes and he goes. Who is going to pay for this door? Alan, his coat's still warm. Seems he just left. - He'll be back. - You put that down, that's private property. Who's his posh friend, Mrs. Hackett? What posh friend? I don't know any posh friend. Yes you do. The one who pays his rent. That Lucy tell you? She's a lying little slut. He pays the rent himself. Now what's he doing? - You tell him to put that down. - What is it, Jim? -Medicine? - It's more like... Sulfur or something. Bloody vandal. I had the key! Mrs. Hackett, if you're not out of the room by the time I count five. I'll close this rat hole down, do you understand? INSPECTOR PALMER: One... - INSPECTOR PALMER: Two... - Filth. That's what he is. Filth! What does it say on the label? - "Reflux". - What's "reflux"? I don't know. I want a 24 hour watch on the street, and someone in here all night, watching the old hag. - I don't want him warned off. - Where you going? Back to the Yard. I want to know what's in this bottle. Wait a minute, who's going to sit with the old hag? It's you she fancies, Jim, not me. Thanks. - [FLIES BUZZING] -Oh, God. The Cafe Royal. Where is my daughter going, Williams? I-I think to her dress maker, sir. At the Cafe Royal? Get your hat and coat. I want you to deliver a letter to the office of the London Record. [VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND] ...then, the dawn came up. She touched my hand. I watched her slip away. JEKYLL: I can still feel that touch. Even now. - I'm so sorry, Henry. - She was my wife, Sarah. And your father thinks I killed her? Try to forgive him, he's... he's old and... I'm making it worse. How could you make it worse? By being friends with you. He's accused me of being your mistress. Now that's outrageous. I'm going to talk to him. No, it's not important. This is got to stop, Sara. - It doesn't matter. - Of course it matters. Talk like this could ruin you. It's not me he's trying to ruin, it's you. Me? Why? Sit down, Henry, please. You're replacing him, don't you see? - No I don't see. - Then you're blind. All his life he's been respected for his knowledge. His books are the standard books of medicine throughout the world. And now you've challenged him. Science moves on, Sara. Nothing stays the same. You're not listening. You believe that science should have no limits. He sees that as evil. Evil... is not a scientific word. Perhaps, that's why he fears you. "Man was made in the image of the creator. "So not only are Jekyll's idea's dangerous, "They also laugh in the face of God." The writing of an old man, Mr. Devlin. We can't print a word of it. I'll send it back. Dr. Lanyon is a past President of the Medical Council, Snape. You don't ignore a man like that. Not entirely, sir, I do agree. - But, apart-- - Show this letter to Jekyll. We'll print his reply on the same page. I was going to suggest that, sir. Oh, you were? Where you? Hi. Well I persuaded the editor to print this letter after all. Oh, splendid. Give my regards to Dr. Lanyon. And get my name right. Snape. Edward Snape. Of course. Give my regards to Richard. I hear he's in line for Admiral. So they say. You'll enjoy Singapore. Sunshine, all those Navy parties. Don't mock me, Henry, please. Mock you? I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. What did you mean? It's getting late, I should go. Sara. I've known you since you were a little girl. What's wrong? Nothing, I'm just tired. It's more than that. What is it? I don't love him. It's not his fault, I just... I don't love him, I never have. Oh, Sara. Why did you marry him? Why? - You know why. - No. - I don't. - Yes you do. Because... Because I couldn't have you. Bye, Henry. Sara. This is the gentleman, sir. He's been waiting for over an hour. I told your man we've met before doctor. But I don't think he'd believe me. Edward Snape, London Record. - Yes, Mr. Snape? - My editor received this letter today. It's from an eminent surgeon. A Dr. Lanyon. I've decided to print it. So, I thought you might like to comment. Your appearance is due at 8:00, sir. Thank you, Poole. Isn't your father a member of parliament, Doctor? A man with progressive views, like yourself, I believe. What's in the letter, Mr. Snape? It's in the nature of an attack on your book, sir. I was just admiring your art collection. Very impressive. SNAPE: And I say that as one who prefers photography to art. The advance of science so to speak. But then, that's what the debate's all about, isn't it doctor? The advance of science. We'll print your reply, of course. Doctor? I said we'll print your reply. A chance to put your views across. SNAPE: I'm sure that's only fair. Don't you agree? I-I I'll have to eh... study the letter first. I'm sorry Doctor, we're going to press in two hours.Perhaps I could ask you a few questions instead. You were once married to Dr. Lanyon's daughter I believe. Do you mind telling me how she died? Good evening, Father. Where are the chairs? Where's my chair? Are you addressing me, madam? Father what's going on? I'm not your father. I have no daughters now, both are dead. - What do you mean? - You are not welcome here. You must go to your husband. Father what are you saying? Williams, you'll remove this person from my house. And after that you'll post this letter that I have written to her husband. I do not wish to see her again. Now do your duty. No wait. You were seen! Seen in the park! In the arms of your lover! Now get out! Williams, please, leave me alone. I'm sorry ma'am, I have my orders. Father make him stop! Adulteress! I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm truly sorry. Very interesting Theory, Doctor. Our readers are always interested in scientific matters. Now, just one more question. This conflict between you and Dr. Lanyon, is it entirely scientific? Or could it be... well, personal matter? He's the one who wrote the letter, Mr. Snape. - Why don't you ask him. - Oh, I will, sir, that's my job. But it is a strange coincidence you must admit. A father-in-law with a grudge perhaps. Has been known before, if I may say so. Excuse me, Doctor. - Yes, Poole? - Could you, spare a moment? - What is it? - I-I think it's important. What is? Mrs. Crawford is here. Mrs. Crawford? I'll show you out. [SARA AND JEKYLL CAN BE HEARD SPEAKING] It's no use-- POOLE: Will you come this way, please? All right, but he won't get away with this. -Sara, listen. - [SARA RESPONDS INAUDIBLY] Who's the eh... lady? Good night, sir. Stop worrying, you'll be all right. - Sir. - Ah, Poole, get some towels and call Mrs. Clark. Mr. and Mrs. Jekyll are arriving. - Henry your parents. I must go. - Nonsense. Crawford. Mrs. Crawford. Close those doors. Good evening, Mr. Jekyll. - Mrs. Jekyll. - MRS. JEKYLL: Evening, Poole. MR. JEKYLL: Good evening. And then, the Secretary of State asked me if I enjoyed the evening. So I told the old fool the truth. - What did you say? - Oh, don't encourage him, Henry. It was most unseemly. I simply said, that if the soup had been as warm as the Champagne, and if the fish had been as fresh as the maid, and if the maid had been as willing as the Hostess. MR. JEKYLL: There would have been a very rewarding evening. You should have seen his face. It's a wonder we're invited anywhere. MR. JEKYLL: Your mother's still ashamed of me, Harry, after all these years. To rewarding evenings. What, in Port wine? Where's the Napoleon brandy? This is the Doctor's room as you can see, madam. I'm only the house keeper, of course, but I put you in here because I've had no instructions to the contrary. I'm sure it'll be all right, Mrs. Clark. I laid out one of your sister's night gowns, I expect it will fit. - Thank you. - It's no trouble. MRS. CLARK: He kept all of her clothes. They were a very devoted couple, the Doctor and your sister. So they tell me. I've changed the sheets. Good night, madam. Good night, Mrs. Clark. Well, if you gentlemen will give me a moment to myself. - Thank you, Poole. - Coffee will be served in the drawing room, Mrs. Jekyll. You can't fool me, Harry. So don't try. Fool you? How? MR. JEKYLL: You're over-working. I can see it in your face. I worked like that too, to educate you. And I'm very proud of you, but... Don't kill yourself, boy. I'm proud of you too. He didn't say much, Mr. Devlin, as you can see. So who is this woman in his house? The butler called her Mrs. Crawford. I have looked in the medical register. But there's no Dr. Crawford listed. Medical register? People mix with their own kind, Mr. Devlin. He might have been a doctor's wife. Oh, she's somebody's wife. Stay with it. I smell a scandal growing. Good night, gentlemen. Good night, Harry. Thank you. You're mother's right you know, you should marry again. MRS. CLARK: Doctor! Dr. Jekyll. Might I have a word with you sir? JEKYLL: What is it, Mrs. Clark? I've looked in on Mrs. Crawford and she's sleeping soundly.I don't know weather you would like me to make you up a separate room, or weather you've made your own arrangements. I'll be eh... staying at my club tonight. If you say so, sir. But nobody told me. It's my fault, Mrs. Clark. I forgot. You know best, Mr. Poole. Sara Crawford? - Louise's sister? - Yes. I'll tell you about it tomorrow mother. Very well, dear. Good night, Harry. Good night. - Good night, Harry. - Good night. [JEKYLL SCREAMING] [GLASS SHATTERING] [GROWLING AND GLASS SHATTERING] [GROWLING] Doctor? Doctor? What is it, Poole? I don't know, Ma'am. Dr. Jekyll. JEKYLL: It's all right, Poole, go to bed. Is anything wrong, sir? JEKYLL: I just dropped something. - JEKYLL: Go to bed. - Is there anything I can do?Go away! Would you-would you like a hot drink, ma'am? No, thank you. - Good night. - Good night, Mrs. Crawford. [BREATHS HEAVILY] [GLASS SHATTERING] What's the time, Jack? Half past bloody two. You hungry? What is it? Bread and cheese? No, it's smoked salmon souffle. Eat it while it's hot. Jim. Fits the description. You think it's him? JIM: It could be. - He's going in. - Let's find out. That's his room. - Ready? - Yes. - [GROWLS] -Look out, Jim. I got him. Hold him, Jack. [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] Oh, my God. He's dead. [PANTING] [FOOTSTEPS] [SCREAMS] Morning, ma'am. It's Poole. Mrs. Crawford. I have breakfast for you. [SOBBING] Mrs. Crawford, What is it? Mrs. Clark. [POOLE] Mrs. Clark. [POOLE] Mrs. Clark! Mrs. Clark, come quickly. Mrs. Clark! Mrs. Clark! Mrs. Clark, where are you? I can't wait any longer. When Sgt. Hornby get here, give him this box. Here he is now, sir. How's Jack's wife? How do you think? Two little boys as well. You better lock me up, Governor, because I'm gonna shoot that bastard dead. Calm down, Jim. Here, take this. - What is it? - The bottle. The one we found in the room. I want to know what's in it and what it's used for.I'll tell you something, he's gotta get his bloody strength from somewhere. He killed Jack with one hand. So get it analyzed. You know what reflux means? I looked it up, it means "flowing backwards". Allen... we've got to get him now, you know that, don't you? Oh, we'll get him. That I guarantee. He was just sitting there. [GASPS] He was just sitting on the bed. Oh, God, it was horrible. Don't talk. Drink this, it'll make you sleep. Poole, where's Mrs. Clark? Damn woman's gone out. I wanted her to stay with Mrs. Crawford. No. You'll feel drowsy soon. I want you to get some sleep. He was... He was... How did he get in? He was there on the bed. You wanted me, Doctor? Where have you been, Clark? To get the police. They're downstairs now. [MRS. CLARK] I hope I did right. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Look, if you want any more, get 'em yourself. Hey, how old are you, cheeky? Thirteen. Do you want to be fourteen? Ah, Ted, here's your article. Literature at last. How long is this going to take? Ten minutes if you're lucky. Twenty if you're not. Here, have some. Keep up your strength. Very funny. So when can we see the lady? Uh, not until this evening. She's under sedation. Do you know how he got in, sir? The window in my laboratory is broken. Poole, perhaps, you would show the officers. Certainly, sir. This way, please. [DOOR CLOSES] DEVLIN: Punctuation at the... ...the story on page three. DEVLIN: Which one? Eureka. Hello, Mrs. Crawford. They're writing a news item, for heaven's sake, not an essay. Quote the prime minister in the first paragraph. Yes, sir. Society page, three years old. "Marriage: Captain Richard Crawford of the Royal Navy to Sarah, youngest daughter of Dr. Charles Lanyon." That's who she is, Mr. Devlin. She's Sara Lanyon. Lanyon's daughter in Jekyll's arms. It's happened before. Wife dies, duff the sister. Sharpen your pencils, Snape. Never blunt, sir. Doctor accused, doctor accused doctor accused of fraud. Doctor accused of fraud, all the latest. Doctor accused of fraud, all the latest. Royal visit to India. Doctor accused of fraud. Doctor accused. Take him back? What do you mean take him back? The place is crawling with coppers 'cause of you. But I can't find anywhere else. Then why'd you go to the police, you stupid little slut. 'Cause he beat me, that's why. But he didn't break your neck. I'll get you, you old bag, you see if I don't! I'll tell 'em about the doctor. You do and I'll kill you. [THUDDING] You're back. The police are looking for you. That man died last night. You killed him. So I'll need more money. Tell the doctor I'll need more money. Understand? Oh, God. Come in here and tell me about the doctor. That is impossible. What is wrong now? Well, if the powder's acidic, it should turn this indicator red. You don't know what you're doing, do you? I'm a technician, Sergeant, not a genius. You should've taken it to a chemical analyst. That's not what you said when I brought it in. Where do I find one? Try the universities. I want a name. Well, ask the man who wrote that book. Perhaps he knows hat the bloody stuff is. I don't. CHARLES: Margaret, step aside, please. Morning, Dr. Lanyon. Morning, Margaret. Margaret. Right. Hello, gorgeous. A girl like you could flutter a sailor's heart. Is the captain's wife at home? Who's asking? Of course. You must be Margaret. How'd you know name? "Prettiest girl in my fair," the captain always says. Ah, how right he was. Are you from Captain Crawford's ship? A finer captain never sailed the seven seas, Margaret. But, he... He's besotted. Captain's behaving like a lovesick duck. "Ted", he says to me, always calls me Ted, "Ted," he says, "when you're in London, "tell my dear wife how much I miss her." I'd do anything for the captain. So, is the lady at home? Oh, no. - What's wrong? - Well, she's gone. Dr. Lanyon slung her out last night in the pouring rain. They say she's got a lover. That Dr. Jekyll. A lover. Margaret, I'm shocked. I never thought I'd live to hear it said. What are you gonna tell the captain? The truth, Margaret. Sad, sad, truth. Hey, just a minute. What's your name? JEKYLL: Yes, Johnson, I have read that article and the record. And I think that Dr. Lanyon is blind. All over Africa men who believe that they're going to die... they die. And why? Because the mind controls the body. Alter the mind and you alter the man. If that were true, we could be whatever we wanted to be. And one day we will be. Tall, short, strong, weak, like... grafting roses. But that's like playing God. Yes. And it will happen. Science will control our shapes, our intelligence, even create new breeds of men. Violent men to fight our wars, docile men to do our work. Hell on earth. And I... I want no part of it. All right, I'll ask again. He walks in here and he rents the room, what was his name? I told you, he said he was a doctor, that's all I know. And then a week later, Hyde arrives, he turns this pig pen into a sewer, starts hitting the girls, you don't complain. He was a patient, the doctor was treating him. He must've paid you a lot of money, our friend, the doctor. Twenty pounds was it? Thirty to shut your mouth? Cuff yourself off. All right, Mrs. Hackett, who is he? Who is Hyde? Answer me! The devil. What? The devil. [FLOOR CREAKING] Sara. Are you awake? Oh, I was frightened. Can I talk to you? Of course. Ah, oh. Oh, my head hurts. - I'll get you something. - No, don't go. Have they found him? No. And they won't. What do you mean? They'll never find him. Why not? Because he isn't real. But, it's not my imagination, he was here, he was in this room. I'm not making it up, it happened. Sara, hear me out. I know how real he can seem. Because I know who he is. You know him? Then how can you say he's not real? He was induced. You're not making any sense. If you know who he is, then he is real. Who is he? Who is he, Henry? He is me. Oh, no, this is insane. This is insane, what are you saying... I don't have much time. If I tell you, will you listen to me? Right to the end? Doctor, the police have returned, they're asking for Mrs. Crawford. Tell them to wait. Sir. Please, Sara, listen to me. I am in more trouble than any man alive. [WATER RUNNING] POOLE: Dr. Jekyll. The police will see you now, sir. I'm coming. Right. Let me see if I've got this straight. You didn't see his face. Not clearly, no. And you can't describe his clothes. It was too dark. At 7:30 in the morning? The curtains were closed. Mrs. Crawford, I know this is distressing. But is there anything you can tell us about this man? Anything at all? Ah, Doctor. SARA: There is one thing, Sergeant. SERGEANT: Yes, Ma'am. The window in the doctor's room is broken. We've seen that. Well, perhaps he climbed in there. Not unless he was a contortionist. It was broken from the inside. Oh. I'm afraid there's no more I can tell you, absolutely nothing. I'm sorry I wasted your time. I see. Well, if you do remember anything. Yes, you will be the first to know. Good night. Good night, ma'am. - Good night, Doctor. - Good night. Yes, we will find our own way out. What's her game? You mean you don't know? Lover's tiff. Jekyll hits her, butler find her, all very embarrassing, so she spins us a yarn. Nice looking girl, though. Yeah, better without the bruises. [CHUCKLES] May I show you something? This is where he was born. He's hidden in here. 18 years to work it out. Insects, mice. And one day, last April, I saw it in a flash. It should've been able to turn the ugly beautiful and... stupid bright. But all I found... was Hyde. Henry, I don't understand any of this. No. Please, listen. That was a wonderful thing. What you've just done. You gave me back my freedom. It was more than I deserve. Well. This is my answer. - Henry, no. - No, Sara. No, Sara. Let it burn. But it's your life's work. It's a trial. I'm a doctor. I'm supposed to get rid of pain, not cause it. I took an oath. That's what my father always says. He was right. And I was wrong. Will you go back to Singapore? Do you want me to? [GROANS] [ORCHESTRA MUSIC] [ORCHESTRA MUSIC ENDS] BERESFORD: Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Living with her own borther-in-law? Annabelle, are you sure? Ah, Charlotte, it's all over the papers. They don't even deny it. It's outrageous. My dear, that's why the whole town is talking. Charlotte, it's Beresford Mount. CHARLOTTE: Beresford Mount. Bravo! Dr. Jekyll? No, sir, this is Dr. Jekyll. Ah, Doctor, my name is Beresford Mount. We've been reading about your theories in the papers. Very controversial. How would you care to discuss that over supper? I don't need an argument tonight, Mr. Mount. And in any case, I'm dining with friends. Ah, yes, so am I, sir. The party I'm with is sitting up there, in the royal box. You see, I'm private secretary to the Prince of Wales. Perhaps we could all meet up in the foyer and go on from there? It's been a privilege to meet you, Mrs. Jekyll. Annabelle, you don't think they've been invited, do you? [CHUCKLING] Certainly not. The Prince has more sense. MAN: Encore! Very good of you to come at this late hour, Dr. Lanyon.I had very little choice. Until five minutes ago, I was a guest at the commissioner's dinner table.Where is this substance? Here, sir. There's not much left of it, I'm afraid, I've carried out so many tests. - What tests? - The ones in your book, sir. You've eliminated strickmine, ordine, morphine? Not yet, Doctor, no. Potassium permanganate? All the opiates? I don't have the equipment, sir. Yes, I see. Well, I'll give you a list of what I need, and I shall start after lunch tomorrow. VENDOR: Chestnuts. Get your chestnuts. Hot chestnuts. - Thank you very much. - Get your chestnuts. Hot chestnuts. Get your chestnuts. Plenty of customers? Call it off, Guv, you'll not come back. Then we'll have to find another way, won't we, Sergeant. Bloody waste of time. Hot chestnuts. Get your chestnuts. - Here you go. - Thank you very much. Fancy a chestnut? And so when I told them I was not Mrs. Jekyll, they all just nodded and smiled. What else could they do? The Prince has a string of mistresses. - Two of them were there. - A string? Hmm, that's why he looks so old. He doesn't look a day over 40. You know he's only 16? [BOTH LAUGHING] - Fool. - Oh. Let's stop at my parents' and tell them we had supper with the Prince of Wales. They'll love that. Oh, no, Henry, please, I can't face them yet. Of course, you can. Driver, stop please. No, Henry, please, I... I've had too much champagne, I can't even get my words out. Nonsense. They'll never notice the difference. [LAUGHS] No, no, you go. - Without you? - You'll enjoy it. Go on. Driver, take the lady to number 4, Clifford Street, please. Or as you would say, Strifford Cleet. Hmm. Don't keep them up too late. [WHIP CRACKING] Nonsense, celebration is a celebration and it calls for Napoleon brandy. ...heroes and the talent of the week. I can't remember where I put it. You always do this. Why do you keep hiding it? Because the cook is annoying. [CHUCKLES] Now you look that side, and I'll look this side. The Prince hides his brandy, I'll wager. Well, you were with him all night, now you know that, don't you? What Harry said to the Prince and what the Prince said to Harry. I think I'll sleep down here. We didn't say much, you know. There were 12 other people there. Well, that won't stop your mother, she'll make it up. Now, about Sara, is she getting a divorce? You can't thumb your nose at society forever, Harry. They'll freeze you out in the end, they always do. Harry, what have you done? No! - No! - What is it? [GRUNTING] Harry, what is it? [GROWLING] WOMAN: Mind where you're goin'. MAN: Wait, look out. William? Henry? I heard a noise. Are you all right? [GASPS] [SCREAMING] [HYDE PANTING] Ready? [BLOWS WHISTLE] [ALL CLAMORING] Get out of the way. Get out of my way! [OFFICER SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [PANTING] We've lost it. It's no use. Why did it stop here? ...come on. "Jekyll", "Dr. H.J. Jekyll." Jim. [PANTING] Who is it? Who's there? [GASPS] Henry, what is it? What's wrong? What's happened? He's killed my father. Oh, my God. I can't control him, Sara. He's inside me. Inside you? No, no, you destroyed it. The chemicals, everything, you destroyed it. He's a part of me. He's, he's like a huge viper living inside of me. I keep him drugged but he's very strong. It worked at first, but he's so strong. [GASPS] Oh. My love. [NEWSPAPER BOY] Murder! Murder! Get your news. Murder! Murder! Get your news. Murder! Murder in Mayfair! Get the paper. Murder! That's a very sophisticated compound, Inspector, that's why it's taking so long. These four of the ingredients are completely unknown to me. Quite extraordinary. All right, bring me the distillation. Don't go to too much trouble, Dr. Lanyon. We only wanted to know what it might be used for. First I have to know what it is. TECHNICIAN: Sir, shouldn't it be at clear this time? Clear liquid? CHARLES: Of course. It's not. It's happened again. Look. How much of the original compound is left? Only about an ounce. I'm going to send a small sample to every research institute in London. Good idea, sir. There is an answer. There must be an answer. Unless you find it. All right, thank you, gentlemen. Right, Doctor, I'll see you out. Goodbye, sir. I hope you sit on a bunsen burner. I thought you admired him. [SCOFFS] Not after what they said about him in the papers. Threw his daughter out in the rain. Old reptile. I kept the paper on the bench just to embarrass him. You should've seen his face. Jekyll. Dr. H.J. Jekyll. Allen, Allen. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Mother, it's Henry. Dr. Lloyd said it is irreversible. Yes. It's a stroke, isn't it? Yes. Can she hear you? No. And she can't see me either. That's him. Mr. Snape. Sergeant Hornby, Scotland Yard. Ah, yes. Apparently you wrote this article. That's right. What do you know about Dr. Henry James Jekyll? Enough. Why? Does he treat any special patients? Dangerous ones? Violent ones? Oh. [CHUCKLES] I get your drift. MAN: Copy boy. Do you mean the sort of lunatic that might push little girls under coaches right outside his house? Might even live in the house, Mr. Snape. Well, well. Sit down, Sergeant. I'll tell you everything I know. It's hopeless. You found it once, 'you'll find it again. There are 32 different ingredients, Sara. Over a thousand combinations. It took years and I have burnt all my notes. I'm going to see my father. I know he will help us. No, it's too late, there's no time. But he's already helping the police. It says right here "Chemicals were taken from the suspect's room in Lion house "for analysis by the eminent Dr. Charles Lanyon." Lion house? Excuse me, Doctor. A visitor's arrived. They didn't destroy it, Sara, they didn't destroy it. Who is it? It's Mr. Utterson, ma'am, he's downstairs.They have a whole bottle. Uh, ma'am. I'll analyze it and reproduce it. Shall I say it's inconvenient? - Yes. - It'll only take a few days. No, No, I'll come. Henry, wait here. Sara, I apologize for arriving announced but I had to offer my condolences. Thank you, Jeffrey. I'll tell Henry. A double tragedy. I hear Mrs. Jekyll suffered a stroke. Yes, yes, we saw her this afternoon. I'm so sorry. AS the family lawyer, if there's anything I could do, I...You're most kind. Perhaps we could see each other in a day or two. [THUDS] What was that? The front door? Henry? Henry? Wait. VENDOR: Get the records. Vinyl records. All new. Vinyl records... [PANTING] Oye, watch out. - Around the back. - All right. There's three around the back and two at the end of the road, sir. Right. Wait here. Hello, Sergeant, any chance of an exclusive? Wait and see. Dr. Lanyon, there's someone here with a note. I told him that you were dining. But he told it requires an answer. It's from Jekyll. He wants me to see a patient. I told you to wait outside. Help me. All right, Williams. - Leave us. - Are you sure, sir? He's a referred patient, I have to see him. As you wish, Doctor. Well, what is it? Powder, where is it? Police gave you my powder. Where is it? It's with the letters over there. I was sending it to colleagues to find out what it contains. What are you doing? I am saving my neck from the gallows. You can't drink that, it's poison. [LOW GRUNTING] [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] [GROANING] [SLOW BREATHING] Charles. Help me. Please. ALLEN: A fair likeness, Mr. Utterson? There can't be many men like this, Inspector. Precisely. Last month he injures a child outside his house and last night, he's out there again. Have you seen any prowlers in the neighborhood, Mrs. Crawford? Nothing suspicious? - No nothing. - You surprise me. Two weeks ago, you told the local police you were attacked and raped in this very house. Is there anything you'd like to tell me, Mrs. Crawford? It can't be. Charles. Please listen to me. It's a trick. It's not a trick. It's meta-biological change. It's just not possible. But you've just seen it. It's fast relation on a massive scale. But I don't know how the cells reform. You're insane. No, I'm not insane. I'm desperate, Charles. In the name of mercy. There's not enough time, you must help me. With your knowledge and mine, we can suppress it, reverse it. I know we can. - How? - We'll analyze the powder. How much do you have? How much? The green bottle. The one from Hydrome. I labeled it "Reflux". You have it. Where is it? Henry... Henry. There is no more. Help me. Somebody please help me. Only God can help you now. Then why doesn't he? Thank you, Poole. Ma'am. And you have nothing to add to what you told the local police? Nothing, Inspector. Then I'll bid you good night. POOLE: Dr. Jekyll, there's someone... Dr. Jekyll. - Dr. Jekyll. Dr. Jekyll. Henry, Henry. Oh, Henry, thank goodness, I thought... Go away. Leave me. - I need to talk to you. - Look. - Oh, no. - He's coming, Sara. Go before he kills you. Run while I'm still here. In heaven's name, go. - [GROWLING] -Henry. - Sara, what is it? - Go away. You are going to die. No. Go away. HYDE: No. - Yeah. - HYDE: No. There's someone else in there. HYDE: No. Leave them. Sara, stand aside. Leave them alone. HYDE: No. Inspector, Inspector Palmer. Yes. No. No. I love you, Henry. No. In god's name I love you. Yes! - [GUNSHOT] -[GASPS] Sara. - [GUNSHOT] -[SARA GASPS] [WHIMPERS] [SOBBING] Sara, my dear. Come away. Come, come. Break it down. JEFFREY: Is he dead? ALLEN: Shot himself. Twice. JEFFREY: But there was someone else. ALLEN: No sign of break-in. Jim, make sure that reporter stays outside. And get a sheet. I want him covered up. JIM: Right, sir. Suicide. I never knew, Sara. I never guessed the truth. My father died about a month later. That's why I'm the only one that does know. And now, me. Yes. And now you. What will you do? Live here, with my son. But he must never know, Jeffrey. - Of course. - Ever. I...I assume he's Henry's child. Oh, yes. He's Henry Jekyll's child. Harry.
