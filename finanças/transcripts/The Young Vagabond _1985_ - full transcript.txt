Thanks. SU MANSION Please come in. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Su, happy birthday! -Thanks. -Thanks. Please come inside. This way please. Where's our son? Congratulations, Mr. Su. Wishing you longevity. -Thanks. -Thanks. Dad, mum. Where did you go? It's your dad's birthday. I just went out. Big aunt is here. Sister-in-law is here. She's the elder sister of your late wife, not mine. Even then, she's a relative. Big sister. Congratulations, brother-in-law. It's your birthday. Just a small gift, hope you'll like it. Thank you, sister-in-law. Jiabao, greet your aunt. Hello, aunt. -This is Jiabao? He's grown so much. -Yes. Where's your elder brother? Where's elder brother? Honestly this kid. How could he forget his dad's birthday? -Jiabao, find your brother. -OK. Another drink! Your turn. Drink up. Your turn. Your turn. Get up. My turn. He's drunk. I win again! Brother! Jiabao, this idiot challenged me to a drinking game. He had no idea that I started drinking as a toddler. Big brother. Do you know it's dad's birthday today? All our relatives and friends are there. If you don't go back soon, dad will get mad. Doesn't matter, your mom can't stand me anyway. Big brother! Come on, let's go home. Big brother. Little sister. How much did you profit from this banquet? Remember, we'll split it. -Congratulations. -Thank you. All these years I've worked in the winery, when have I ever forgot about you? -Congratulations. -Thank you. Chan's back. Have another cup. Dad. I've given you money for clothing. We have so many guests here today, look at you! What are you wearing? Dad, I'm always dressed like this. Do you know that people call you "Beggar Su"? -Dad. -Big brother. Dad, he'll get changed now. Welcome. Thank you. Let me introduce you, my two sons. This is Mr. Billy Yang. He's the local chief heading foreign trade companies, he's a Taipan. This is Chan and Jiabao. I'm Richard Billy Yang. Mr. Yang, I know you like seafood. That's why I've specially prepared some very nice seafood delicacies for you. Both of you will lead him. Please follow me in. Jiabao, there are so many guests here, you ought to entertain them. Your brother can take care of the guests inside. Your family has good seafood. Buttocks? What did you say? I said you make very good seafood! Go to hell! -Stop fighting! -This is none of your business. What's going on? Stop! What happened? -He hit me. -Yes! Chan, have you gone nuts? I haven't. But he has! He said our-- What? He said our family have good butts. I said seafood. I'm sorry. You thought seafood means butts? That's English, seafood. Master Su... -What is it? -They insisted on coming in, and asked for five hundred taels of pocket money. They beat us up when we refused. Master, look! Fellows, today is my birthday. Could you not do this? -Chun. -Here. -Give them five taels. -Yes. Phei! We're not here to beg. Your winery is very famous in Guangzhou, -how could you be so stingy? -That's right. If you're not here to beg, then what are you doing here? We want five hundred taels. Five hundred? That's too much. Come and get it. Beggar Su. I know you can drink. Drinking is similar to fighting. They're basically the same. -Is it? -Of course. Let me drink to you. -Stop it! -Stop fighting! Thanks. One turn each, see which one of us falls down first. Are you all right? Stop fighting! Get a hold of him. Time to go. You want to leave? Very well. -Big brother, are you all right? -I'm fine. What was that? -So? Do you need a doctor? -No, dad. Of course not. The show is over. What are you trying to say? I said you put them up to this. Do you believe that he alone could do all that? Sister, don't blow his cover. Today is a good day, this is a show. That's true. Hey stepmom, I have something to say to you. Never mind... forget it. What is it? What did he say to you? He swore at me. "What left me yesterday can be retained no more, what worries me today are the times I feel sore. Wild geese fly for miles and miles in autumn winds..." Big brother. What? The other day you swore at my mother, right? No, only at your grandmother. Silence, sit up. "We long to bring the moon down from the sky..." I want you to apologize to her. What? Apologize? Forget it! "Life isn't always what you wish it. -Let's sail away with our hair down." -Hey. This is a famous poem by Li Bai. A farewell to Uncle Yun, the Imperial Librarian. When Li Bai wrote this... Pick it up, everyone. ...he felt very-- In the sentences, "If we despair all along our life, tomorrow let's sail away with our hair down" means... Su Jiabao, Su Chan... you two have black eyes! Didn't sleep well last night? Yes. We went to bed very late. Then you must go home and get some sleep after school. Where was I? Right, the meaning of the poem. Meet me at the back of the mountain if you've the guts. Curse on your mother! Technically we have the same mom, say something else. Fine. You low, despicable, shameless, scum, heartless, inhumane, loser, scum of the society. Feel better now? We're even? Not unless you apologize to my mother. Impossible. Heartless scum. It's pointless even if you cry, I'll teach you a good lesson. Who's crying? I'm not. Come on. Not you? Pretty girl. Who are you? I'm Su Chan, his elder brother. He's my brother. Look at him! An idiot! His features... bring only bad luck. He's not as handsome as me, Su Jiabao. -Handsome? -Don't talk this way to a lady. -You big panda! -You're the panda. -Panda. -You're the panda. You panda! Why are you crying? Did you get bullied? By whom? We can help you. -That's right. -It's all my fault. My dad sent me to study English last month. The priest taught me English, but I didn't understand. My classmates bullied me. I couldn't help it, so I cried. That English school with the foreign priest downhill? What priest? Just a foreign monk. What do you know? -Stop it! -Today you-- Will you behave? Don't worry. We live besides Liwan, behind the Su Winery. If you get bullied again, look me up, I'm Su Jiabao. And me, Su Chan. That's all right, my dad could help. Brats! Picking on our classmate? You've got some nerve! I know them, they're from that school. Are you bothering our classmate? They're picking a fight. Brother, let's drop our grudge for now and fight them together. What's your name? Dingding. Dingding! Dingding said you pick on her every day. From now on, stop bullying her, or else. You want to teach us a lesson? You heard that? Ready? Front, but not the back. Do your best. Good one! Are you scared? Both of you! You! -Nice one, brother. -Of course. Where's Dingding? She's gone. Let's go. -They wanted to fight with us. -Exactly. Luckily, we ran fast. That was easy. Dad. Where were you? What happened to your eyes? We... We composed poems at a friend's place last night and didn't sleep. Yeah, didn't get any sleep at all. That's right, no sleep. Poems? It's time to learn to do business. You must know more foreigners. From now on, don't study at Teacher Liang's school. Really? I want you to study English and do business with them. From tomorrow, go study in the English school run by Father Malin. Study English? Hey! Give it back! For you. It's quite nice here. -There's a lot going on. -Yes, it's so lively. You two! Dingding. It's a nine. Pay up. -Hey! -What? They're here. The two brats we fought are here. Let's go! -What are you doing here? -We're here to study. Really? What are you guys doing here? We're here to study English. To woo girls? Get out! We know her! I don't care! Get out! Hurry! -Out! -Stop pushing! Brother. -She's way out of your league. -That's enough! Fighting back? That's useful. Brothers conquer all! What's "Father"? I'm not sure. -Father. -Class, I always tell you, we're all brothers and sisters. We should help each other. And shouldn't fight. She's smiling at me. What's that noise? -Fatty, wake up! -This classmate must be tired. Let him take a nap. Class. We have two new students today. Su Chan and Su Jiabao. But for smooth running, we all have English names. English names? Su Chan, you're called "Sunny". What? Sunny? Sounds like a sour pear. I hate sour pears! Yes. Su Jiabao, you're "Michael". Michael? Sounds like selling dogs. That sounds awful! Quiet. Mary, help them if they don't understand anything. Sit down. We'll have a P.E. Class later. We're playing football today. Playing football. Sunny, Michael, do you understand? No. Football is also what you Chinese called “Kick the ball”, where you kick the ball into the goal. But remember, only kick with the feet, not with the hands. That's easy. All right, let's begin. The competition begins. Go for it. -Over there. -Go! No hands! Kick! Go! Hurry! No hands! Kick it! Go! -Hey! Go tell father. -OK. -Father, he used hands. -Hurry up, let's go! Got it! No hands! Sunny and Michael, you broke the rules! -What rules? That person used his hands! -That's right. I forgot to tell you. Only the goalie could use hands, penalty kick. Penalty kick... pass us the ball. What's going on? Pass us the ball. -They won't cooperate, father. -Sunny, Michael. Penalty kick. You can't stand here. Go. Come on. Are you all right? Go after the ball! Foul play! Can't believe this! We've lost another goal, brother. He touched the ball, foul! Begin the next round. -Let us do it. -Hurry up. It's fine. Got it! -Faster! -It's all right! What's wrong with you? Where's the ball? -Over here. -Did you see the ball? -Hey! -Pass the ball. Wait. Bad luck! Come on! Hold on, let me! What's wrong with you? Yay! Get down! Over here. Too late. -What's the matter with you? -He stepped on my feet. We're catching up. We're even. Come on, brother. Go! Do your best. Kick it here. No tricks! Kick! We won! We lost. What? How? Can't stand being the losers? You lose. Brother, they're fully prepared and waiting for us. We don't want a fight. If we've offended you in anyway earlier, -I apologize for it. -Apology not accepted. No! Get the father. Get the father! Now! All right, it's our fault. Fine. Then get the hell out of here now, or we'll throw you out! Fight. Stop! God bless you! Change! Here I come. Who started it? Sunny and Michael did. You're the one! Sunny and Michael did. It wasn't me. They started it. Damn! Shut up! Since no one is coming forward, I have to kick you all out! What the hell? They started it! Father, I started it. I alone fought with them. My younger brother wasn't a part of this. Brother. It's just me. Father, it's Sunny's fault, I'll take the blame. And I'll walk out myself. Jiabao, study hard, so you can help with dad's business in the future. Listen up, you lot! I'm not your classmate anymore. Don't try to bully my brother! Or else you'll get it from me. Jiabao, I'm off. See how the Yellow River's waters move out of heaven. Entering the ocean, never to return. Admiring lovely locks in bright mirrors. Though silken-black at morning, have changed by night to snow. Oh, let a man of spirit venture where he pleases. You're nothing compared to Jiabao. You got kicked out of school? I knew you're a good-for-nothing. Spin a 1000 pieces of silver, all of them come back! Your turn. Begin. See how the Yellow River's waters move out of heaven. Entering the ocean, never to return. Admiring lovely locks in bright mirrors. Though silken-black at morning, have changed by night to snow. Let a man of spirit venture where he pleases. Your wine's good. And never tip his empty golden cup towards the moon! Since heaven gave the talent, let it be employed! Cook a sheep, kill a cow, whet the appetite. And make me one long drink of three hundred bowls. To the old master, Cen. And the young scholar, Danqiu. Bring in the wine! Let me sing you a song! Let your ears attend! What are bell and drum, rare dishes and treasure? Teacher. Su Chan, what did you give them? Tea. Really? Let me try. You don't need to, it's really tea. I... Your tea's good! Quench the thirst. My tea? Great tea. If you like it, sir, please, drink it all. I think I shall. Do you have similar kinds of tea at home? Yes. If you like it, I'll send some to your doorstep tonight. Do you think I'm greedy? Just take your best pot. Back to your seats and recite again. See how the Yellow River's waters move out of heaven. Entering the ocean, never to return. Admiring lovely locks in bright mirrors. Though silken-black at morning, have changed by night to snow. WU FENG WINE HOUSE LUCK NURTURE TALENTS LIKE FLOWERS What are you sneaking around for? I've brought you the best tea, sir. Take it back. Teacher. I told you to take it back. I took a lot of trouble for it, I won't take it back. We'll drink here. It smells so good, I'll wash my face with it. Doesn't it smell great, sir? Cut running water with a sword, it will faster flow. Drink wine to drown your sorrow, it will heavier grow. Life is full of despair, let's sail away with our hair down. Chan, you recite it. I can't, sir. I just taught you this morning. Life is full of despair... Good! Let's sail... sail something… So vicious? Drunken Tiger in action. Spiritual Monkey stretches. Black Tiger stealing the heart. That's a strange move, sir. What is it called? Pee. Why would you pee in the middle of it? What's wrong, sir? Got stuck. It's broken. I'm a poor teacher. Even if you don't eat, you need to buy a new one. Look at this! It's dangerous. You know it could take away all your pleasures as a man. Do you think I'm very happy now? Sometimes I'd check if I'm happy. Heading to bed, sir? Go home now. I'll bring two more pots tomorrow. No? Bring four. Our teacher knows martial arts. Really? The teacher's here. Good morning, sir. Morning. Yesterday we studied the poet Li Bai. He's a Fairy of Wine. He wouldn't board the Imperial Boat. You could tell what personality he has. He's free and bold. Other than known as Fairy of Poems, he's the Fairy of Wine. We're bored. Will you teach us martial arts, sir? Yes. It's boring to study the verses day after day. That's exactly why, we'll continue with Li Bai's poems. This poem "Parting at a Tavern in Jinling". The tavern's sweetened when wind blows in willow down. A southern maiden bids the guests to taste the wine. My young friends have come for my farewell. Is the teacher really that good? Of course! The "Drunken Tiger Walk" is amazing. Get the teacher to teach us! Go on. Go on! Go! -Tell the teacher to teach us! -Me? Yes, go on. All right. The tavern's sweetened when wind blows in willow down. Master. What are you doing? Heading to the toilet? Go on. Master, they said they're bored. Why don't you teach us martial arts instead? That's right. Teach us martial arts, master. Please. It's boring to recite the poems. Have you gone nuts? Stop talking nonsense. No. You taught me the "Drunken Tiger" yesterday. Why don't you teach them? Teach them? That's right! Let everyone learn. Everyone can learn it. Nuts! You must be reading too many comic books. You might as well go to Emei Mountain to learn "Flying Swords". -Master. -Call me teacher. If I knew martial arts, I'd beat you to death first. So that I won't get angry. Shut up! Your hand. Tiger claw, master. Tiger Claw. Master. Why do you keep following me? Why won't you admit that you taught me martial arts? I think you've gone crazy. I don't know any martial arts. Master, is it because you don't want others to find out that you know martial arts? When did I teach you? If I did, I'd go and set up my own martial arts school, why would I be a teacher here? -Master... -Address me as 'teacher'. Go back and get some sleep, and you'll be fine. Teacher. I'll bring more tea for you, sir. Very well. See you tonight. I showed you martial arts last night? Could this be fate? Is he destined to be my student? -Good wine, good pupil. -Good master, good teacher. Chan, those styles I taught you, do you still remember? I really liked all the moves. Idiot! Fool! Brainless. Pig brain. What's wrong, sir? No matter what, I have a set of styles. When that happens, it could be seen through. That's why I lost. But you're good, how could you lose? You're brainless, but I'm not that stupid. I got it. If I erase every single move from my memory, wouldn't that be the end? Isn't that even worse? Practice more, focus on the strengths, could tolerate beatings… If I don't have any style, I could have something original. I'm beginning to get it, master. That way, no one could tell which style you'll use. That's right. Do you remember what I just taught you? -Yes. Everything. -You have such a good memory? Yes. Very well. What was that? -Tiger Claw, stay back. -Scratch me. Tiger Claw. Ah, Chan, don't use that. Use something original. Tiger Claw again? I'm leaving. This isn't fair. Wait! What was that? A "sneaky trick", my original. What's that? Dog bites bone! Another original. This jade is gorgeous. What's the matter? Stop sneaking up behind! Sister, you've stolen a large share from your husband. What do you want? Chan is useless, he got kicked out of school. Master Su wouldn't trust him anymore. I think I should convince him to pass the family business to Jiabao. I know that! When Jiabao's in charge, I'm in charge. At that time the old man is useless. That's right. I just worry about the brothers and relatives. Chan is his eldest son no matter what. What if he's dead? Master, the wine's here. I don't want to drink tonight. You don't? Then what will I learn tonight? While drunk when I teach you martial arts, I tend to lie to myself. I didn't want to disclose my identity, but I worry that my original martial arts style wouldn't be passed down. That's why I'm teaching you. Master, I'd like to ask... Why are you hiding your identity? Me? Guess what job I had before? Martial arts expert. No, I was a robber... aka "Drunken Tiger". I worked with a famous robber, Wu Gong, and we robbed rich families, banks. Then we split the goods. I got tired after a few years. And Wu Gong is a vicious fellow. A rapist... he spared no lives. I didn't agree to that. In our last job robbing the Liang Zhengkai family, He ordered eight of his lackeys to rape the females in the family. It's way too much! What do you want? I want out! You want out? But you know too much. How can I be sure you won't betray me? Well, your 8 lackeys certainly aren't my match. What about me? What style was that? It wasn't anything specific. There's no need for it. I was hiding around after I got injured. Wu Gong was after me, and I was a wanted man. They all wanted me to die. That's why I concealed my name. And you started teaching? It's a blessing in disguise. I was very arrogant. Since I lost, I tried to come up with answers. Then I realized there's no need for any specific style. Only that's invincible. I see. You must remember. Don't show the others what you learn from me. -I don't want to be on the run anymore. -Understood, master. There are some snacks in the kitchen, bring them out. What are you doing? Go on! Yes, master. Move over... JIN ZHONG MARTIAL ARTS STUDIO -Boss. -Brother Bai. Please. Have you heard anything from Taifeng Bank? Taifeng Bank is the biggest in Guangzhou, and most heavily guarded. Recently, they've hired foreigners to custom design a special gate and vault. We've heard that, on the third of next month a large load of jewelry will be deposited. All right. Good work, when do we start? There's no rush, boss. The average customers can't go near the vault. There's only one way. How? Boss Bai is confident, don't worry, Brother Wu. -Who's he? -He's on our side. He will passed on the news of Taifeng Bank. But he hopes that you could help him get rid of Su Chan, the eldest son. That's it? Thanks, Brother Wu. Stop. You followed me all the way from Guangxi. You have a lot of patience. That's right, I followed you here. So you plan to rob Taifeng Bank. Do you know why I didn't blow your cover? I wanted to know more about you. Tell me... what do you know about me? You are a robber, don't be too smug. We'll arrest you eventually. You won't talk, then I'll beat you to death. Water. Water! What's wrong? He's obsessed with cleanliness. Can't stand stains. I'll go get changed, throw him into the ocean. Yes. Get the body. COURAGE Search him. Me? It's a document. These are official documents. From the Guangxi Police. This is a major case. A Guangxi detective got murdered in my territory. I'll be in trouble. They broke his skull, that's scary. I'm Iron Tooth, I'm fearless. Then according to you, I know who the murderer is. Who? A man. Only a man would have that kind of strength to break his skull. Everyone knows that. Do you know where the murderer is now? -No. -You don't know? Idiot. He's definitely in a man's favorite place. Where? In a brothel. I'll investigate in private, go to all the brothels. Can we claim our expenses? Sorry? Stay here, check the body. Count the number of bones that got broken. Then move the body back to the magistrate. Got it? The rest of you come with me. Yes. Enjoy. We're off. For fun. Old sex maniac. FRAGRANCE BROTHEL Meet the guests. Baby, let's go upstairs. Come on. We skipped school today for this. My dad would be very angry, come on. Eat some more. -Eat. -Drink up. Michael, who do you really like? -Where's your Fengxian? -Not here yet. Exactly. Ignore him. -Drink more. -Hey. Get the madam. Don't go, what did you do that for? Jiabao. Michael, your brother's here. What is it, brother? Jiabao, I heard that you've been skipping school, and hanging out with a bunch of rats. Is it true? Not at all. They're all from good families. We're just here for fun. I might perhaps be able to do some business for dad. Jiabao, save the excuses for your mother. You have a chance to study English, why don't you put some effort in it? This is really embarrassing. One more thing. I'm learning martial arts now, come and join us. I need to manage dad's business in the future, what do I need martial arts for? Forget about this, let's have a drink. Master Jiabao, sorry. What for? Fengxian is with a customer next door. Do you think I can't afford it? What's the big deal with the customer next door? I'll pay double. Drag Fengxian over. Go! I can't, the customer... Fengxian can't come here. I'm Detective Iron Tooth. I'm not a womanizer. I'm honest, brave, smart and a gentleman. All my good traits. Then what are you doing here? I'm not here as a customer, but to investigate the lives of prostitutes in Guangzhou. I'll try to help you to get out of here, to free yourself, my baby. -We're really suffering. -Really? Tell me. A girl here got venereal disease. Eventually she got paralyzed. And sat on a stool for years, five long years before she died. Then, even the stool she sat on got venereal disease. You're joking! I don't believe it. You can try sitting on it then. Where? The one you're sitting on now. Really? Then I must go change my pants. And change Fengxian, too. Who are you? I'm Fengxian's boyfriend. What? English. Fengxian, come here... -Master Jiabao. -Come next door. Kid, do you know who I am? Yes. You're my dad's cousin's husband's aunt's godmother's son. What's that? Adopted uncle. Heard that? Adopted uncle. -That can't be right, boss. -What's wrong? Technically, you should be his adopted grandson. He played me. You've got some nerve! Beat him! Better to be fast! Go! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it! Are you all right, brother? Move aside. Some nerve you've got! You hit my nose! -Do you know who Jesus is? -I don't know. When slapped on the right cheek, he asked the same for the left. Do you get it? He told you to love thy enemies. You've hit my nose! You always aim at my nose. Stop! Stop fighting! Stop! -Stop! Enough! Stop! -You kept aiming at my nose. Stop. I'll lock you up. Stop it! Stop! Stop! You're all part of it? I'll arrest you too. -Arrest? -Yes. Based on what authority? -I can kill your entire family if I want. -Detective. Hurry! This way! Faster! -Su Jiabao! -Hurry! Don't run! Stop! You go there, I'll go over there. Freeze. A fair lady, a bride fit for... our lord. A gentleman. -Oh, it's you, Su Chan. -Someone's after me. -Someone's after you? -They're bad people. I'm just hiding here. It's all right, I'm the only one home. Studying the Book of Songs? Yes, my mother said that, though I'm learning English, I must learn some Chinese classics, too. That's right, we're Chinese. But I'm not making progress. My dad has no time to teach me. That's easy, I'll teach you. Oh! You study Chinese literature. You can be my teacher. I can't, I'm not qualified. But I think I could help a little. How about you join us for dinner tomorrow? And I'll introduce you to my parents. Then you can teach me, all right? Alright. In March Plum blossoms, peach blossoms And narcissus all bloom What's the occasion? Why are you so clean? Different days, different needs. Are you getting laid? Could you rephrase it? All right, in a nice way. You're going on a date, and hope to take the friendship to another level, right? Since when have you had a girlfriend? I'm going to join them for dinner. Stop bragging. I also have someone I like. Who's she? It's a secret. You're going like this? This is my best outfit. Are you serious? Pick one from my room. -No, thanks. -Here's one... These clothes are quite fitting. What? My mother gave this jade to me, wear it. I'd be in trouble when step-mom finds out. Don't worry! I told you to. Go on. You can't be late on your first date. Thanks, aunt. Have some tea. You're Chan? Yes, aunt. Stand up. Not bad... you have a chance to be rich. What are you doing, mom? Fortune telling. Chan, let's begin. A single guy and a single girl will easily become a pair. And it would be too late then. I must keep an eye on you. Mother. Very well. I'll leave. I'll go make dinner. Your dad will be home soon. You sit over here. My mother is like that. She likes to stare at people. Do you bring lots of friends home? No. My mother likes to do fortune telling. Am I the first guy you brought home for dinner? My dad's here. Dad. You brought a guy? Yes, he teaches me the classics. Let me take a look at him. Have some tea. Let me introduce you. This is Su Chan, he is my dad. What are you two doing? It's the flu season. Please have a seat. Take a seat. Listen. Don't say a word about me in the brothel. I can do it myself. You look so familiar, have we met before? Dingding, go help your mom in the kitchen. You asshole. You just hit me and now you want to seduce my daughter? I must kill you, where's my sword? Please... let's talk it over. -Uncle, you're very strong. -Of course... Take a look at this sword. Let's take a look. -Give me the sword. -No! Give it to me! Just some rusty sword. Give it to him if he likes it. Thanks, aunt. My dear wife. You're the death of me. Uncle. Listen, don't try anything funny. Just testing. Get up. Stop taking the sword back! It's a gift for him. You! Don't return it to him. Let's eat. Don't you even think about it. Come on, hit me. -Come again. -I will. For real? Of course. This is the back of the blade. Hey, it's for real? It was a misunderstanding last time. Misunderstanding? I'll charge you for attacking a cop. You've ruined the social order, and wrecked eight stalls, and thirteen hawkers. And you still haven't paid the teahouse. I'll arrest you and lock you up for a few years. Please, don't. You're holding a weapon. That's another charge. Please sit down. -Don't touch me. -Don't be angry. Let's eat. Please sit down and have a rest. Have a seat, let me give you a massage. I'll beat you... You'll be unlucky your whole life if you use the broom. Nonsense. -Throw it. -Give it back. Nice bamboo. Why are you two playing with the broom? Nice broom. -What? I bought that from the market. -This bamboo is easy to break. You must watch out for the broom's quality, madam. -Take it if you like. -Sure. -Sit down. -Thanks. Let's eat... Help yourself. -Have some vegetables. -Thanks, aunt. Thanks. What's the matter with you? I choked. Feet... What now? I want to eat chicken feet. I think you should eat chicken butt instead. Sure...

Why did you throw a dish at me? -I was aiming for that brat. -What for? That brat beat me up at the brothel the other day. At the brothel? Yes, he... Brothel? I thought you got injured while catching a thief. Brothel. Here we are... TAIFENG BANK Is your dad throwing a dinner party again? -Sorry to bother you. -If he's not, then why would he send you two here to the bank? Making a withdrawal. All right. Gen, open the vault and lead the young gentlemen in. Please follow me, gentlemen. This way, please. Master Bai, welcome. -Do you have any orders, boss? -Bring the customers inside. Please, follow me. Master Bai, come in and have a seat. Sure. What are you doing? Jiabao, run! Help me, brother! Act as the opportunity demands. You don't have to come for me anymore. Be careful! Stop fighting! Let's go! Run for it! Hurry. Kid, where did you learn your Drunken Tiger Fists? Impressed? Follow me if you want to learn! Speak up! The soldiers are here, let's go! Run! Chase them! Su Family ill-treats us, so we can do whatever we want. CULTIVATE MORALITY AND MIND They have a solid wine business. Then we can do something. Zhu Chun wants you to kill Su Chan for him. That's right! Promise him! And ask him to locate Liang Hong. Brother Liang, how have you been? You can't run away from our grudges. Let's meet in the forest tomorrow night. Wu Gong. You've improved over years of hiding. You've finally found me. I can find anyone if I want too. Stop playing around. No matter what act you put on, you're evil. And you've got a good student. It wasn't planned. I never thought that you'd be in Guangzhou, trying to rob Taifeng Bank. You've ruined my plan, again. How will you cover my loss? I'm here now. All right, let me take a look at how much you've improved. Not bad! I lost to you, Brother Wu. I couldn't use the "Drunken Tiger Fists" again. OK, since you still treat me as your elder brother, let bygones be bygones. Go! Brother Wu. Take care. Thanks for letting me free! But I have something to say. It may sound bitter, but put an end to the wrongdoing. Or else, the future won't be bright for you. I have no choice, brother Liang. In fact, I want you dead! Go! Who's next, boss? Beggar Su. Mountains would be famous if fairies lived there. Seas only have spirit if a dragon lives in them. Even if it's a simple hut, it has to be tidy. Color of grass visible through the neutral window. I associate not with the ignorant for mere jest. I'm bored. Chinese literature is not exciting. Let's wrap it for the day. So, how's your family? My dad is no longer prejudiced against me. Jiabao behaves much better now. But my stepmom and her brother-- They will finally come around. I hope so. Dingding, you really are my good friend. My dad keeps saying bad things about you, but I ignore him. Dingding. My mother is awaiting me for dinner. I'm off. -Are you free tomorrow? -Yes, no. What is it? Tell me whether you're free tomorrow. I guess not. I'll wait for you along Pine Path, I want your company. Why? Tomorrow is my birthday. Birthday? My younger sister said that they've a date tomorrow at noon on Pine Path. We'll take care of it. After completion, you and your sister will be in charge of the money. What's our share? You mean... 70-30 split. You want 30%? I want 70%. Is that too much? I'm telling you, I'm calling the shots here. I can kill you first. Whatever you say. Jiabao, open up... Jiabao... Coming. What do you think, brother? Come in. Why are you dressed so nicely? To meet the girl I like. Jiabao, can I borrow an outfit? Take your pick. I'm meeting Dingding. Dingding? I know it's her birthday, that's why I'm going to congratulate her, to surprise her. So you like Dingding? What's so strange? I've liked her for a long time, but I haven't told her yet. Jiabao. This is nice. I know she has a boyfriend, but I don't know who he is. If I find out, then... What? If I could marry her, that would be nice. What about this piece of jade? Good. I'll give this to Dingding for present, what do you think? Good. Take your time, I'm off. Jiabao. -What is it? -Dingding isn't home. How do you know? I... heard. Dingding's taking a walk down Pine Path around now. -Really? -Yes. Go on! Thanks! Master. Master. SORGHUM WINE Stop it! Guess who I am. It tickles. Guess who I am. It hurts. Guess who I am. Who else could you be, Chan? Chan? Jiabao. So, Chan's your friend. He's too nice to me. -Jiabao... -What is it? Oh, no! It's Jiabao. You've killed Jiabao! -You killed her too? -Why would I let her live? What now? We'll finish the job. We'll now go and rob your sister's home. Don't worry. We'll give you a share. Dingding. Chan? Chan... Dingding. Chan? Mom. How come you're still here? I treat you well. I gave up the girl I like for Jiabao. They're now having a good time. Jiabao is on Pine Path? Oh, no! Wu Gong. You know Wu Gong? Jiabao! Jiabao... Where's my son? CONSTABLE'S OFFICE Dingding, Jiabao! Jiabao... Tell me, who killed them? How would I know? -My daughter's dead too. -It's my fault. Jiabao, it's my fault, my son. Stepmom, who killed them? You did! You! It's all because of you! Why did you give up your girlfriend? You're supposed to die! You asshole! He's dead because of you. Dad. Dad. Wu Gong. Uncle... Master. Master. Master. Wu Gong. A victory for us, boss. Let's split the winery. Yours on that half, and I'll take this half. Check the figures. Sure. It's all mine! Freeze! Wu Gong.
