(brooding music) (dramatic music) (brooding music) (thunder crashing) (rain splattering) (thunder crackling) (scratchy romantic music) [Boy] What are you doing mommy? Come on. ♪ (mumbles) memories (panting) (thunder rumbling) Remember baby, mommy loves you. No matter what happens just be very quiet, and the evil will go away, I promise you! (thunder crackling) ♪ In a dream (woman singing) ♪ A thousand guys with a billion lies ♪ To make me feel that way (thunder crashing) ♪ What you do Please, no... (ax thudding) (tense music) (glass breaking) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (ax thudding) (dramatic music) We have the curse boy! You can't escape it! (pistol firing) (pleasant music) (panting) Al! Al over here! Hey. Albert! Albert, wait a minute! Hey, how you doing? - Ok how are you. - Good, good to see 'ya! (lips smacking) Oh here let me get that for 'ya. (grunting) Oh, I'm sorry Danielle. Let me get that for 'ya! - That's okay. - Thank you. I already had my last class so we're gonna be leaving right from practice. Where should we meet you guys? Um, tell you what, why don't you just meet as at Dina's Cafe? Okay, well, ooh, I hope I remember, I don't have a pen on me. You don't need a pen, it's the only place in town, really. I tell you what, why don't you meet us here after school, and then um, then we'll just caravan to the lake. Sounds good. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Al! Hey! Steve's looking a little impatient, I guess you better go. - Right. - Okay. - Okay. - I'll see you later. - Thanks for the kiss. - Hey. - Bye. - Bye! Goodbye! See you later! (energetic music) (students chattering) Hi ladies! (mumbling) Get off me! I ain't not Casanova. It's all you, it's all you... (students chattering) - Hey Sarah. - Hey Sarah. What's up? - Hey guys. - Hi. So what are you still doing here? I thought you'd be gone by now. No, Bobby had a late class, we're just waiting for him. Why are you here, you have a late class? No I'm just waiting for Danielle and Christy, you know, cheerleading practice. You working on? A story, it's really important. I don't just want to be a reporter for the paper next year, I plan to be the editor. Sarah, you're just a freshman, kick back, you got four more years of this stuff. Professor Haler says they usually elect a senior for Editor, and I'll be back east by then. So my only chance is if I can come up with a really great story for my term paper. What about athletics? Our team's doing great. Albert here could give you the scoop on the track team and I can cover football for you. Yeah, straight from the mouth of a jock, forget it! I need something exciting, (mysterious music) totally riveting. Professor Haler thinks I'm a creative and imaginative person who will some day go on to be a novelist, after I keep (mumbles). Hey Steve, what's the matter? You look like you're gonna lose your lunch! - Don't move. - What is it? Oh... I feel something. Steve get it off me. (whimpers) Steve, please... - It's okay, it's okay... - Get it off me. Hang on hold on, (panting) oop, oop, it's just a little spider. (sighing) I got it. - Cool. - Hey girls. Hi. (Screaming) (girls shrieking) (squishing) Ooh! Dude, that's gross! Hey that, that's Harry! Or that was Harry from Professor Denton's class? Man he's gonna be pissed, that spider's almost as old as he is! Well it's not our problem Bobby. Maybe Denton can explain why the thing is out. It was all over Sarah. Totally on her, crawled right up her back. Hey Sarah, you gonna be okay? Yeah. How did he get in here? Know what Sarah, maybe that spider really did like you. I'm just saying, people attract weird things all the time. Chemistry. - You all right? - Yeah. Good. I bet Danielle and Christy are ready to go, so, I'll see you guys there. [Al] All right make sure you drive careful, okay? Okay. - Party! - Y-Y-Yes! (boisterous chattering) (energetic music) Hey! Ooph! Phew, can that really be mine, that smells! Just hurry up because Sarah's waiting for us. Have you seen her new car, it is so major! [Danielle] Why did you invite her anyway? Well because, then we'll be an even number in case we want to pair up. Bobby's fine, don't you think? No, I think he's sex-crazed Christy! In fact that's all he thinks about! He's the only person I know that goes crazy over his Human Sexuality Class! Give him a break, Danielle. You know you'd better watch yourself Christy, because you're not doing so hot with your grades either. Oh I'm just going through the motions. Then watch out, I'll phone you in New York, some place exciting. Now you sound like Sarah. She can be really stuck up sometimes, just because she's from back east she thinks she's better than the rest of us! Oh come on Danielle, you like her! Okay, so she's a little different. Yeah I like her, but I just... Sarah, hi! Are you guys ready? Uh, yeah, let's go. You not gonna believe what happened to me, it was so gross! I'll tell you in the car. Okay. Sara this car is so cool! It's beautiful, I love it! Yeah I wouldn't be (mumbles), you know, get their macho up. - Yeah! - Sarah! I think we could beat them. We're gonna (mumbles). (engine starting) [Christy] Whoo! Whoo! (energetic rock music) I don't know Al, I think Danielle's got the hots for you man. Yeah, right Bobby. In my dreams. [Bobby] I'm two ahead of 'ya, gimme another one. [Steve] Take it easy, we still got to drive a... Okay, okay. Mm, oh man I forgot, I gotta call my mom! Let me use your phone. No you're gonna have to wait till we get there bro, I had to turn it off, it's way to expensive. Okay but don't forget to remind me, I gotta call. Oh, Bobby relax, isn't that a momma's boy? (chuckling) Hey, shut up, just, drive. Momma's boy. (energetic rock music) (serene music) Clear Springs. Caught me red-handed fishing on my lunch break. Just about to go back though, city hall beckons and I haven't met my quota of tickets today. You don't usually fish on this side of the lake sheriff. Perhaps you had the same vision that I did. (chuckles) Oh, can't say as I do Clear Springs. All I came out here for is this. Can't fish on your lunch break in the big city, you know that. (groans) The evil is coming Sheriff, I've seen it, I had the vision. Now Clear Springs, I want you to cut out that nonsense, especially in town. We don't want to stir up folks with all that talk of evil spirits and old wives' tales! Now, I've got to get going! You don't understand, Sheriff. Once the spirit leaves the lake, there's no stopping it. It can enter anything and anyone, people, animals, it controls them from within, and it doesn't return to the lake until it has satisfied its hunger. I don't buy it Clear Springs, but rest assured I will keep my eyes open in case I see any old spirits. You're not listening. The people in town, they talk about it but they don't listen. You can not ignore this spirit! You can not disregard their warnings! All right, all right, all right, all right! You have made your point, now can I go? God damn, sometimes Clear Springs you're worse than an old woman. (brooding music) (energetic rock music) [Steve] Man, she was beautiful. [Bobby] Yeah yeah, so? So what? So did you score? You're all horny Bobby, we're sick (mumbles). Thanks Steve. Hey guys check it out! Fever Lake. What's up Al, sounds like kind of a bogus name, doesn't it? Yeah, makes you think of sick people or something. - Yeah. - I think it got it's name actually from the first indians who settled here, named it after some evil spirit in the lake or something. Indians? Do they still have tribes around? No, wiped out. (tires screeching) - Whoa Sarah, what's going on? Did you guys see that? What, there's nothing back there Sarah. Sarah, are you okay? Forget it, I must still be a... (energetic rock music) (engine revving) (tires screeching) (siren howling) - Oh great! - What? My second ticket in two months, I don't believe this. Hey we could try to out run him! Yeah right, what do you want to get us killed Bobby? - No fun Bobby. - Here, oh man, Al hide this beer, just hide the beer! Whatever happens, don't let Bobby talk, okay? - Hey, hey man you suck! - Okay. Bobby, just chill, just let me do the talking okay? He may give us a break, we may be able to talk our way out of this. Yeah right, keep dreaming. (siren howling) (energetic rock music) Just act cool, act normal all right? Sir (chuckles). Boys. - Howdy. - Officer. - Boys... - Did I uh, do something wrong, officer? Oh, might have been speeding just a little bit. Where you boys headed? Fever Lake. Fever Lake. Well you must be lost. There's no cabins on this side of the lake. Now, 'bought five miles back, there's another road that'll take you around to the other side. Nice cabins to rent over there. Well thank you but, we're not renting a cabin. We're staying at my friend's house. Yeah, the Kendall place. Kendall place. No one's been up there for years. Yes sir, but uh, they told me the place was a complete wreck. Who are they? - Hey officer... - Bobby, sh! - Hey, is this gonna take... - Sh! Boys, boys, I know you got a cooler of beer back there. Now listen, this is a quiet lake, and we don't take kindly to strangers, especially those throwing loud, and wild parties. I understand sir. We plan on a nice quiet weekend of fishing. (energetic rock music) (girls shouting) Friends of yours? Yeah, you could say that. Figures, yeah (sighs). Slow it down. (engine revving) [Christy] Yoo-woo, woo! Whoo! (pleasant music) [Deputy] Can you believe this squall that rolled in? No I don't but you know it's gonna be gone before you know it. Mmm, alrighty. We'll see you Marge. See you later. (girls chattering) My camera... Well come on in, how about, the booth in the corner? Uh, yeah, sure, that's fine. Um, I think we're just gonna have something to drink. - Do you have ice tea? - Sure do. Three ice teas? - Uh-hmm. - Okay, I'll be right back. You know what you guys? These people are really creepy, I mean like way out there. It's a small town, they're not used to strangers. Ew, I could never live in a small town. Everyone always knows your business. Yeah and you'd really be in trouble then, wouldn't you Christy? Mmm, you know it. Three ice teas. Oh, and there's free refills too. - Great. - So, where you guys headed? Oh we're staying here at Fever Lake, it's some house. (chuckling) You guys are kidding me, right? No. Why? Well, you guys can't go over there. You know what happened. Don't you? (clearing throat) Um, you let me know if you want some more ice tea. Am I paying you to work, or to be a chatterbox? You're right, this place is creepy. I say we wait for the guys outside. That's okay by me. Ugh, me too! I got it. Who are you trying to impress? Steve's cute, don't you think? Yeah he's all right Christy, so is Bobby, if he wasn't such a pig. I think Albert's adorable, he's so shy. [Christy] Oh he's weird. You just like him because he's in awe of you, he's not your type Danielle. That's not true Sarah, he's really sweet. I mean he practically stutters when he talks to me, he's so nervous! Besides wasn't it nice that he invited us all here? Yeah. Where are you going? Home, my shift's over. You live close by? Oh, about a mile. I take a shortcut though. Don't worry you'll get one. I didn't get my first car until I was 17. I can't wait. What's wrong with everyone here, it's like, they're all in on something secret or something? Yeah what was it you were gonna tell us about the lake? Yeah. The lake. (tense music) [Sarah] Hey, look who finally made it! [Danielle] Well it's about time. [Sarah] I told you we'd beat them. [Christy] Hi guys, thanks for showing up! Hey ladies! (Laughing) Well well well, thank you! Hey girls! Man I gotta call, man I gotta all my mom! - Shut up! - Oh oh oh oh! Hurry up folks it's not exactly warm outside. You wuss, come on man! Brrr... The townspeople don't like anyone talking about it. (tense music) Mom, yeah yeah it's me. It's an evil spirit that lives in the lake. Even when it's cold, and the lake is ice, there's always this one spot in the middle that stays hot. You can actually see the steam rising, when the spirit is about to come out. I have a big study weekend, I'm staying at a friend's house. (slapping) Uh-huh... A few years ago, I was only like two years old, a man murdered his wife, and then turned the ax on himself. No, I-I can't help him this weekend. Since that day weird things happen every time someone goes up there. People have drowned or just, disappear mysteriously. Okay Ma I told you, listen, Ma, I gotta go, it's just we, we gotta get going. Okay. Yeah, I love you too mom. Mm, bye. (Boisterous chattering) People just don't stay on that side. They aren't too many cabins. - They say... - Who says? (dramatic music) [Waitress] I, gotta go. You guys have a good time though. Hey, do you want a ride? Oh who was that? That's Lila, she works at the cafe. Hey Albert this place is weird, maybe we should go back? Come on, just kid stuff, just trying to scare you guys that's all. - He's right. - Yeah, let's go guys, let's go party! - All right! - All right. - Shotgun! - Whoo! (plucky country music) Don't you worry about those kids, I saw 'em, it's harmless. Hey you going to the barbecue on Friday? Uh, let me tell you something, I'm gonna ask Jenny, this time. Uh, you know they're - I'm really gonna do it. - They're staying at the Kendall place. That bothers me. Something's bothering me, come on open. (lock buzzing) You know, it must be a relative or something. I vaguely recall an aunt back east, you know. It's possible, that he's on her side of the family. Well that old place, no one's been up there for years. I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. Just kick 'em out! You know we can't do that. But I am gonna keep an eye on 'em. Scary shit's been told about that place. Why I remember hearing stories about how... Oh shit Danny you believe that crap too? (sighs) Shoot no! I, I-I was just telling you. Well good, you told me, now, do something! (pensive music) (sighing) (tense music) (energetic sinister music) (tense music) (energetic sinister music) (pleasant music) [Steve] Where do I turn? [Bobby] Right where Albert said. [Albert] That's the driveway. - We are here. - Yeah. Wow, this is (mumbles). (boys chattering) Whoa. - That's three bags. - So? We're here for one weekend. We're women, what do you expect? (mumbling) I know, I know. [Steve] Great looking place Al. Steve-o, do a little fishing, huh? - Yeah, this is bad. - All right! - Hey Albert! - Yeah? Open the door. Oh go on in, it should be open. Your family just leaves the door open? Um, I'm gonna move my stuff, you guys make yourselves at home. - All right. - You bet. Christy let's go get the cooler. Hey listen uh, cool it about his family. He's an orphan you know. What? Oh god, wait, whose house is this then? Don't know, but what does it matter? Just don't bring it up, let's not spoil the weekend. Okay. (anxious music) [Albert] Well guys here it is! Whoa, check all this out. Al, man, cool pad. (mumbles) Steve. Hey I want to put my stuff away, what's the room situation like around here? All right we've got two rooms, one for the girls, one for the guys, they're both upstairs. Oh uh, cozy. Come on Steve let's go fix a room. - Come on let's go! - You guys are great, up the stairs, and check it out man! (serene somber music) Danielle, what are you doing? I'm watching the sunset. It's beautiful. (knocking) Girls! Hey, hope the room's okay. Listen, uh, a little note, there's no televisions, there's no telephone, so I hope you guys don't freak out or anything. You gonna survive? Yeah, it's perfect Albert. I can't wait to get down to the lake tomorrow. [Albert] My neither, it's gonna be the best weekend ever. Okay, bye. See Christy, isn't he adorable? (crickets chirping) (mysterious music) (dramatic music) (screaming) Sarah what is it? What what? - Oh! - Oh, man! (laughing) I swear you totally scared me! You scared us! Gross, poor things! Danielle take it easy. People do things differently around here, you know? And these things were killed for food, not for sport. Besides, I mean these skins are probably used to keep someone warm. Whatever, I'm with Danielle, no hunting! No hunting. Hey what happened? You missed it. Well I'm starving, let's eat. Good idea. Let's chow, let's chow, let's get some red meat! I miss everything man. Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub! (tense music) (crickets chirping) (water splashing) (brooding music) Albert, did you hear? You coming? - Yeah I am! - We're gonna turn in, get an early start on the lake tomorrow. - Cool. - All right. [Albert] What's up man? (energetic sinister music) (dramatic music) (computer beeping) (energetic sinister music) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) Mr. Martin? Lila, what are you doing up so early? - You working today? - No sir. Well girl, is there something special I can do for you today? No not really. Well, I was wondering... Yes? Come on girl, spit it out. Do you ever have any dreams? (brooding music) I mean, dreams about the lake. Or you know, strange dreams? So you've had some strange dreams and you're wondering what they mean, hmm? Well, yeah, like everyone else I do have some dreams too, but you have to remember that, they're only dreams, girl. And dreams aren't real. Now uh, if you want to hear some strange stories, I can oblige 'ya. They were sleeping like babies, probably won't even be up by the time we get back. Yeah, well I left note just in case. Oh, don't forget we have to get marshmallows, I got a craving for 'em. Hey Albert you sure they sell bait? Steve, we're at a lake, of course they sell bait. (boys humming) Hey, what's wrong Steve? (starter grinding) (energetic sinister music) This is impossible, I know I filled up before we left. Maybe we're leaking or something. Good news is we're close enough to walk, so we might as well do that. Hey guys wait up man! Wait up! Come on! That or split up. (tense music) (boys laughing) So did they all die? I thought it only happened once! Well girl, no one will tell 'ya. Truth is, it happened the first time around oh, late '40s. And 15 or so years ago, the same exact thing happened again. And you know what? They all looked alike. It looked like the same people all over again. Well, what was left of 'em anyway. How could they all look the same? How could it happen twice? Do you believe in the supernatural? And evil? Do you believe in evil? You bet, but it's not just twice! It was the Sander's boy, he went up there one day on a bet. Never came back. The indian says the evil spirit of the lake got him. It just swallowed him up. The indians have always known about the evil spirit of the lake. And what about a small boy? Was there ever a small boy? How did you know about the boy? A small boy has always survived the killings. Way back when I was just starting the store... Bud. Now what are you filling Lila's head with? Tall tale? I was just asking some questions to Mr. Martin about the lake. You hear things you know. Oh, I know you do. But don't go believing old Bud here now, because, he has a point of bending history a bit, don't you Bud? Whatever you say boss. Well, not whatever I say but... (chattering) Watch the glasses, watch the glasses! - All right, all right! - How you doing Sheriff? - Hello boys. - Hey Lila, Sheriff. How you doing? So how do you like the lake so far? It's great, you know, as long as we can get back there. Oh, having a problem? Yeah, it seems I ran out of gas. Oh. Where? You didn't walk all the way from the lake, did you? [Steve] No, no no, actually we just walked down the road a little way, not far. So we were hoping, you had an empty gas can around or something? Ask and you shall receive. - Oh, great! - There you go. - Thanks. - There'll be a $10 deposit, you'll get it back when you return the can. Not a problem sir. We're here to pick up a few other things too. What kind of bait do you have? Now you're talkin'. Let me give you a tip on what you can use to catch the biggest bass you've ever seen! (boys chattering) Sheriff's an expert on this stuff. All right, you got... Steve, check these out right here man. (pensive music) So how you like it so far? What's not to like? How 'bout you? I mean, you're steeped in all these stories, you know everything that goes on around here. Let me ask you a question. How do you like living here? Well, this should just about do it. - Yeah. - Looks like enough for an army. Well, we're men, we need all this energy for work. - Shut up! - Cleaning the fish for dinner, chopping up the fire wood for the fire, I mean I could go on and on. - Yeah. - Sure, sure. A man's work is never done. All right Al, come on buddy, got the bait, we are ready to go, where's that gas? Keep me hanging, keep me hanging here, - All right let's go Bobby. - Hanging, hanging! Oh! (Chattering) [Bobby] See you later Lila! I hope you got some dip for this! - Let's go, let's go! - Hold on here. So uh, I guess I'll see you around. Stop by the cafe on your way out of town. My treat. I'll do that. Bye! [Bud] I hope the sheriff keeps an eye on things up there. Thanks for your time Mr. Martin. I gotta get home. [Bud] Any time girl. You come on by any time. (pensive music) (fire crackling) (energetic sinister music) You guys, why, why am I carrying the bags anyways, it was your fault? 'Cause you're the smallest guy here, tough guy! - Hey! - You know I still don't get it, I would have sworn it was a leak. Steve I looked, I didn't see nothing leaking. - It's so weird. - Grab a chip. Thanks Al. (energetic sinister music) (eerie howling) (dramatic music) (eerie sinister music) (Lila screaming) (growling) (Lila screaming) (eerie dramatic music) (eerie howling) (dramatic music) - What? - Dude, it's totally full! [Albert] What's going on? Bobby, get in and start the car. Uh-huh. Dude, what is going on? It's so weird. Fine, whatever, let's just go, okay? - Shotgun! - Shotgun! Shotgun, oh, man I always get the backseat! - Here Bobby hold this man. - I always get the backseat. [Bobby] No I always get the backseat! - I said... - Shut up! (engine revving) (eerie tense music) (energetic sinister music) You scared me (sighs). You look great in that suit, I hate you. (sighs) I thought you were one of the guys. Steve was being a peeping Tom. Come on change, the water looks great. You go ahead, I got to work on my paper. Okay but you know what they say, all work and no play makes for a very dull girl. Sure, whatever you say. Ciao. Bitch. (lively cheerful music) - Hey Albert! - Yeah! - Hey! - How's the water? Good, you should come in! (shouting) [Steve] Whoo! If I catch a fish while I'm doing this I'm gonna kill you Steve! Did you get any hits Al? Not yet man. (dramatic music) (muffled screaming) - Danielle's gone! - What? - I swear she's gone! - What? [Steve] What are you talking about man? No Steve I swear she vanished man, come help me find her! (water splashing) (tense music) [Christy] Danielle, Danielle! Yo Danielle, where'd she go man? I don't man, she... - Danielle! - Hey! (Danielle squealing) - Stop it! (Bobby laughing) - Bobby, man! - Not cool! - If you guys could see your faces man, I had you guys going! (Bobby laughing) (chattering) I vant to suck your blood! The evil spirit of Fever Lake vants you! - Bobby, stop it, no! - Bobby, Bobby, Bobby! - What? - They take that spirit stuff real seriously around here, all right? Whatever man. Whatever man? I don't get it. Oh you better watch out Christy, you're next! - Sound like a dork. - Shut up! Come on Christy forget it, Hey you guys think you're gonna teach us some (mumbles).. (boys chattering) - Goes oh, Danielle! - Whatever, if I don't find it you buy me a new one, and a (mumbles)! All right whatever man! (chuckling) I thought it was funny. (computer beeping) Very funny. Probably Steve, or Bobby. (computer beeping) Enough. Wait this is perfect! This is my story. (somber music) (dramatic music) The evil is coming. The evil is coming! Sheriff! Sheriff you gotta do something! Things are always happening every time someone's around that damn house! I want you to stand there now and tell me what you're gonna do about it! Should'a burned that damn place down a long time ago! Now listen cut out that kind of talk Marge, just listen to yourself! For cryin' out loud that's crazy talk! Now this is just an accident, that's all! (sighing) Look, they're starting to track right now, everything's gonna be all right, okay? Now go on home. Go on! (guns clicking) (eerie tense music) (latches clicking) (anxious music) (birds chirping) (clattering) (anxious music) Didn't mean to startle you Sheriff. Isn't this trespassing, or something? Trespassing? We don't use that word much around here. Most folks are pretty friendly. You're the one who stopped Steve yesterday, right? - Uh-hmm. - Yes, he said you'd be dropping in on us. What did you think you'd catch us having a wild party? Well, I had an important reason to come by. Why don't you come downstairs with me and I'll talk to all of you together. Important? Are you gonna lay down the party rules or what? No. Nothing like that. Shall we go? (chattering) I'm not baiting your line again! Hey! Look who I found. Great. You're not here to give me another ticket I hope? No, not this time. I just came by to tell you guys to stick close to the house, don't go wandering around in the forest, especially at night. Ooh I love this! Tell us Sheriff, what danger lurks in the woods? Sarah, I think he's serious! Ooh, Sheriff, so what exactly are we looking for? We're not looking for anything Bobby, shut up and let him finish. Had an unfortunate accident. Accident, what kind of accident? It's Lila, I think you met her at the cafe this morning, I think you boys talked to her over at the market. Yeah, well, this sounds pretty serious, what happened? Is she okay? Well we don't know, we think it was a bear, or a mountain lion, - maybe even a wolf. - A wolf? I didn't know there were any wolves in this area. We're hunting the animal now, in the meantime, please, listen to me. Stick close to the house. All right? Sheriff, you just avoided Bobby's question. Is Lila okay? No. I'm afraid she didn't survive the attack. - What? - And we're all just, uh, we're all just sick over it. My god she was such a sweet girl, that's awful! Well you don't have to worry about us Sheriff, we're not gonna go anywhere. I want you to make that a point, okay? (somber music) [Danielle] Maybe we should just go? - We're not leaving. - I think I'm gonna be sick. Yeah let's go. Hey hey, wait a minute you guys, wait up! Listen I know this really sucks and I feel really bad, but, we can't let this ruin our weekend! - Oh Bobby! - Oh Bobby how can you be so insensitive! Hey listen, we're all here, we're together, let's make the best of it! Dinner's on the guys tonight! Ugh! - Dinner? - I couldn't even eat. - What's the matter with you? - Hey Steve! Did I tell you I'm a Master Chef man? Yeah right. It was kind of rude. Come on now, let's just go. We got to make (mumbles). (engine clattering) (steam hissing) (energetic sinister music) Car trouble Sheriff? Oh apparently so. I told you the evil was coming. Now it is here among us. And I told you, to put a stop to that nonsense, Clear Springs, that girl was attacked by a wild animal, nothing more, nothing less. No, you're wrong Sheriff, it was by the evil! You were deaf to my warnings before. All right, I don't have time to argue. I got a bigger problem now. [Clear Springs] Your car was just another warning Sheriff. Try it. It'll start now. (engine revving) Clear Springs. Yes Sheriff. If I didn't know any better, I'd say maybe you have something to do with things that happen around here. What do you mean by that Sheriff? Well you always know when something is stirring, and, it's lonely out here on this side of the lake. Now, are you sure, that you don't make up these stories to get attention when you come to town? You know, tourists like to hear things like that. These are my tribe's ancestral grounds. We know every plant, animal and spirit that lives here. My people have always tried to help the white man. But you have never even tried to understand our ways. (sighs) All right, I was, I was out of line. I'm sorry, okay? I'll see 'ya. (lively cheerful music) Um, I thought this was supposed to be a gourmet meal, Bobby! - Hey! - Come on, this is perfect. Can you imagine anything different in this setting? Steve's right, this is perfect. Albert thank you so much for inviting us all here, it's a million times better than the dorms. Yeah, thanks Al. Thank you guys for coming down, all of you, it means a lot to me, I appreciate it. Well, I need another beer. - Anybody else? - I'm cool, still working on one. - How 'bout you Christy? - No thanks. [Bobby] Sarah do you need anything? No thanks Bobby. Okay. Shot, it's up! Oh, it's good! It's the perfect story! Yeah, perfectly morbid. A story about college kids getting killed? Come on Sarah, lighten up. She's just trying to scare you. Ghost stories. Oh ghost stories, oh! I have got the most perfect ghost story... Bobby shut up and let me finish. So anyway it just came to me. I mean I realize we're in the perfect house for it. And it just occurred to me. I mean can you imagine? Imagine what Sarah? Professor Haler's face, when I turn the story in as my term paper. I mean, who said it had to be true, it could be fiction. Just think, he'll really see me as a novelist now. (crickets chirping) (footsteps rustling) Well, I think we should go until dawn. I beg your pardon Sheriff. I've tracked everything that moves in these woods, and I'm telling you, there's nothing. That damn animal disappeared. I don't think it could have been a wolf. Wolfs travel in packs, and the packs would still be around. It could'a been a bear. The bear could be miles away by now. Well I don't agree with it but uh, we'll call it a night. You people just watch yourselves. Yeah Sarah just think, you could be on the best seller list soon. Oh, that's enough you guys, hey, let's play, Truth or Dare. Oh no, no way! We're in college now, not grade school. I'm gonna go first. No no, we can't play. - Oh, chicken? - I never played before. (laughing) Shut up Bobby, you'll be swimming with the fishes! All right, I'll play, what are the rules? Yeah Sara why don't you put that thing away, okay? No way, you are perfect material. Danielle why don't you explain the rules of the game to Albert, huh? Hey Sarah, there's a full moon out tonight. Yeah, scary. I'm gonna go get a beer. Don't start without me! Okay Albert this is how you play. Someone asks you a question, if you don't want to say the truth you have to take the dare. (dramatic music) (Christy squealing) (eerie tense music) - Hey! You guys! You guys this is not funny, who turned out the lights? They went out in the whole house, you ditz. (suspenseful music) Were you scared? (sighs) No, I have, no... This house gives me the creeps. (sighing) [Al] Sorry you guys, it's the house, it's old. Oh man, you set this up, I know you did to scare us and stuff, oh that is good, that is real good. - Shut up Bobby. - Shut up Bobby! Did that freak me out or what? Al, don't worry about it, it's under control. Hey, hey, w-whatever! Let's play Truth or Dare. Wait a minute, no truths, but I dare everyone to play a game with me. Oh, please tell me it's Strip Poker, I brought the cards! Well, Hide-and-go-Seek. No, I hate that game! Uh-uh, this house is way too spooky, Sarah. You're all chicken? Chicken? Well, I'm not chicken. Steve and Al are chicken, but not me, I'm in. Well, I guess that means us too Christy. Well that settles it then. Who gets to be it? Me, it was my idea. Well, looks like you're it then Sarah. Okay, Sarah's it. Turn around, no cheating. Fine. One, two, three, four, five... (mysterious tense music) [Danielle] I hate this game. (tapping) (sighing) (sinister tense music) 25, 26, 27... (dramatic music) (squealing) Hey! (Gasping) Hey, hey quiet! Hey you don't want her to find us do you? You scared me Bobby! (Christy giggling) I'm sorry, come here. I'll protect you. (Christy giggling) 48, 49, 50. Ready or not, here I come. (anxious music) (thumping) (wood creaking) Sh! Listen wait, she's upstairs, listen! (crickets chirping) (distant shouting) (tense music) (energetic sinister music) [Clear Springs] The evil is coming! (dramatic music) (gasping) (eerie sinister music) Al, Albert! Wait! Don't leave me here! (brooding music) (computer beeping) (mysterious music) Where are you? (tense music) Danielle? Bobby? (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (brooding music) (dramatic music) (tense music) Al, Albert! Open the door! You guys open up! Come on let me in, this isn't funny any more! Open the door, game's over, come on! Bobby, what was that? Ah, hey, j-just the wind, forget it. (moaning) Danielle! Danielle, wait! Stay there! (tense music) Steve? Come out come out wherever you are. (dramatic music) (tree creaking) (tires screeching) (tense music) (wolf howling) (energetic sinister music) (screaming) (thumping) (energetic sinister music) (clanking) (thudding) (groaning) Steve! What happened, are you okay? Yeah. Some kind of animal trap. Are you okay? Yeah yeah I'm okay, I just think my ankle's pretty bad. Hey what's up with you anyway, I tried calling you but you just took off! I couldn't hear you, Albert took off on me, I couldn't get inside the house, I can't see anything through this fog! Wait a, wait a minute, you couldn't get in the house, why? Someone's locked all the doors. Locked? This game has gone far enough. Here lean on me, I'm gonna take you to a doctor. All right, (mumbling). (grunting) (energetic sinister music) (Clear Springs groaning) (suspenseful music) (flames crackling) (Clear Springs yelling) (eerie howling) (flames crackling) (Clear Springs yelling) Find your keys Steve. Man I don't know, I'm not sure, oh they're in the truck. Okay good, I'm taking you to town right away! Oh, no, we can't just take off, we have to let them know we're leaving. Besides Danielle it's just a sprained ankle, it can even wait until tomorrow. - Steve... - Listen, you can help me ice it, bandage it, it'll be all right. Let's just wait until tomorrow. No way Steve, I'll tell someone to come back and tell them that we're gone! I just want to go now, please! You're really scared aren't you? Please Steve don't make me explain anything to you! I want to go now, now get in the car! All right. I guess it'll be okay. Of course it will, they probably won't even miss us! (Steve grunting) Oh, the defrost doesn't work too good. Be right back, I'm gonna go wipe the window. No Steve forget it, I can see fine! Come on Danielle, you can't see anything, you'll kill us! Well just let me do it then! It's just my ankle, I'm not an invalid! I'll be right back. Well hurry! (Steve panting) Steve hurry! Hurry up! Steve I don't think it helped much. (screaming) (dramatic music) (whimpering) Oh god, oh god, oh! Help me, help me (mumbles) please help me! Help me please! (suspenseful music) Oh god, god please, god please come on! God dammit it please come on, god dammit please! God oh come on, please! (screaming) (glass breaking) (screaming) (tense music) (eerie howling) (energetic sinister music) To hell with you, you son of a bitch! (gun firing) (eerie suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (energetic sinister music) (dramatic music) (energetic sinister music) (dramatic music) (energetic sinister music) (tense music) It was raining that night, and he was coming up the stairway. You were in the attic. And he was coming closer. Do you remember, Albert? (suspenseful music) You did it, didn't you? You killed them, now you want to kill me? - Albert. - I won't let you! - Come closer. - Get away! Give mommy a hug. Get away, get away! You killed them Albert, because I asked you to. Don't be like that. Albert, come closer to mommy. Give mommy a hug, come on. Come on Albert. Come closer. Get away from me! Come closer to mommy. No, no! Get away, keep away! Mommy no, get away! - Be a good boy. - No! Didn't you know I'd always find a way to come back to you? (laughing) (energetic sinister music) - Come to mommy! - You lied! You lied! You promised that all this, this evil would go away! Closer! You liar! (ax thudding) (grunting) Liar, liar, liar! You lied, you lied! Liar, liar! (birds chirping) [Deputy] Well Marge, there they go. I knew there was gonna be trouble the minute I saw those girls. Sheriff crawled the last 1/4 of a mile to get to 'em. Lost so much blood damn near died (sighs). He's beside himself he's so upset. And he feels responsible, he's the one who found them all, you know. Poor man, poor poor man. And in the middle of all that bloodshed, that kid was just setting there, bloody ax and all. - No, don't, don't... - Yeah. Yeah sitting there just like a baby, crying for his momma. Don't that beat all? I tell you once, I tell you a thousand times, I knew something bad was cooking. I told the sheriff, he can't be responsible for no mad man. That FBI bigshot brought up the whole file. Well tell me. Seems this kid was already in a crazy house (poignant music) for most of his life. Chopped up his foster mother. Yep, it was all there in black and white, read it myself. - Lord... - Yeah and they let him go after a few years, like they do with all them psychos. Said he was fine. Yeah well, now look what he's gone and done. I tell 'ya, there's no place safe anywhere anymore. And the worst thing is, Sheriff said they're gonna put him in an asylum again. (sighs) Who knows, maybe he'll get out in another few years. Shame on you talking trash like that. They're gonna put him away for life this time. Yeah I sure do hope so. Those poor kids, especially the two girls. So pretty. Three girls you mean. No, two. I saw 'em myself, and uh, I don't even want to tell 'ya what they look like. (tense music) (suspenseful music) (splashing) Clear Springs, you best go home. The lake is my home. Well then, away from here, because what I'm about to do isn't legal, and I don't want any witnesses. It won't burn Sheriff Nick. Like hell it won't. White man is stubborn about things he can't understand. A man can go crazy like that. And I'm telling you, it's going to blow. It won't burn, but you might my friend, if you can't accept what the spirits give us. You can't dictate that. And I'm telling you as my friend, go! (tense music) The evil will return, Sheriff. (eerie tense music) (glass breaking) (dramatic music) (flames crackling) (tense music) (eerie moaning) (tense music) (eerie moaning) (splashing) (eerie moaning) (tense music) (eerie howling) (dramatic music) (brooding music) The evil is finally at rest. Until next time. (dramatic music) (screechy music) (energetic sinister music)
