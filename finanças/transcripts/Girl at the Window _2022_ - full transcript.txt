Amy. You know, I was thinking that we could get you some new furniture for you, huh? New era, new vibe. Yeah, mom. Thanks for thinking of me. Uh, where do you want me to put 'em? Oh, yeah, yeah. Just dump that right there. Got it. Oh, God. No. Not literally. Hang on! Hang on! Amy! Hi! -I'm Barbara. -Oh, I'm Chris. - Oh. - You guys just moved in, yeah? Yeah, we just moved in. What are you up to? I don't know. He just like makes my skin crawl. Not just 'cause he's dating my mom. Maybe he does it to unwind. It helps him sleep. What? So, he takes a 2:00 a.m. joyride to fall asleep -behind the wheel. -Maybe you should try it. No, it has to be something sus. His headlights are always off. He's just being a good neighbor. Yeah, like a neighbor soliciting sex workers and running drugs, but doesn't want his girlfriend next door to find out about it. So, like what kind of drugs if you had to guess? Oh my God. You are unbelievable. I think I miss him. -Who? -The Clockwork Killer. Things were better when he was around. Oh, not better. Just, you know, my mom insisted on driving me everywhere. Now, that he's gone and she doesn't think my life's in constant danger, I'm back to taking the bus. Right. Well, I'm really glad to say you've processed the trauma of being inches away from a dead body. Okay, the one photo they printed of me in the paper, I'm blinking, so don't talk to me about trauma. They better be page-turners. Mr. Coleman. I guarantee you won't be able to put it down. Guess I'll be the judge of that. Get me a pen. Yeah. Your phone number? Are you serious? Honestly, Amy, didn't Macbeth teach you nothing about ambition? You know he died in the end, right? Yeah. After they make him a king. What was that? I'm just trying something different. It's good, huh? No, I heard something outside. I think we should go. Listen, baby. You know I respect you, yeah? -Todd, please. -Just let me finish. You know, I'm not like other guys. If you want me to slow down or stop, just tell me. You don't need to pretend you heard a-- Help me. Help me. Hey! Hey! Shit, shit, shit. Okay. Okay, I'm coming. Mom. Oh my God. Do you have any idea what time it is? Oh. Oh. What happened to your face? Hold on. Oh, I'm fine. I don't need that. Okay. Well, just sit still, honey. So... ...he was actually quite nice about it. He was just a little bit worried about you. -I heard something. -Mmhmm. You've been having nightmares for weeks, sweetie. No, it wasn't a nightmare. He's got someone in there. - A woman. - Uh-huh. I'm, um, a bit tired. So, let's just talk about this in the morning, okay? Goodnight. The police are yet to release an official statement, but at this stage, it looks like the Clockwork Killer is back. Amy! It's been a six-month hiatus since the last killings, but with one teenager found dead this morning - and a girl missing... - Amy. ...the police are scrambling for any information or eye-witness reports that might help with their investigation. What is known is that the teenagers came here, a popular-- Hey, I was watching that. Okay. Can we just turn off the evil world for a moment, and focus on us? -What were you doing last night? -Are you serious? I already tried talking to you about it, -and you didn't wanna hear it. -Okay. Well, night terrors are normal, sweetie. They're just the brain's way of dealing with stress -and trauma. -Wow. Guess who's been online again. Well, why don't you just wake me up next time? I mean, it's dangerous out there. Yeah, no shit. Well, I want you to apologize to Chris tonight. That seems quite specific. Yeah, well, he invited me to the movies. Wow. Taking a night off from his otherwise busy schedule of prowling. Oh, Amy, let's be nice to Chris, all right? He's a nice guy, and we're in the middle of nowhere out here. I didn't wanna move here. Look, I miss your dad every day. Oh my God. But at a certain point, sweetie, we have to move on. Okay, whatever. All right. Well, we're running late. -I don't have the keys. -Can I drive? Absolutely not. Do you wanna tell me what this is? -It looks like my assignment. -Yeah. Can you be more specific? Okay, um, literature response assignment, Courier typeface, A4 format, five pages, 12-point. The reference text was Macbeth. Yeah, loved it. Worth the hype. Can you read from here? Mmhmm. Um, "My neck buckles under the weight of my head. Or what's left of it. I'm hemorrhaging, I think. Red wells in my eyes, and I'm face-to-face with my own slimy entrails. He tears at my gut with his hook, pecking away, gluttonous. He finishes feasting, leaves me there, impaled high. A warning, no, a trophy." "The raven is hoarse. His voice weak from reporting death." Yeah, I know. I just kind of like struggled to empathize. He's too passive. So, am I supposed to assume you've made him aggressive, so that you can write from the perspective of his victim? A person that's being tortured and killed? Well, no. 'Cause a raven isn't capable of that. My killer is the butcherbird, genus Cracticus. It impales small mammals, reptiles, insects -with a sharp twig. -Yeah. You know, if you'd rather, I could write from the point of view of the killer. All right. Okay. That's enough. Go on. Go. You've got the weekend to resubmit. -Okay. -And Amy... I know the uncertainty of the last few months has been tough, especially given what you've already been through. Now, you've got it out of your system, will you write how you used to write. Um, okay, "Devastated to hear the news of another life snatched away in his prime. We should all have the freedom to feel safe in our cars even at 3:00 a.m. Hold your loved ones close, and pray for her. Whoever she is." Prayer hands emoji, fingers crossed emoji, love heart emoji. Is that-- is that a water droplet? It's a teardrop. -I'll lose it. -What is this? My official statement. I have 5,000 thirsty followers. People are expecting me to say something. What happened to your face? YouTube tutorial gone wrong? No, I was gardening. They found him with his pants in the front seat, -brains in the back. -What, they find the body? Oh. Well, a dog walker found the car and the body at 4:00 a.m. They should honestly question the dog walker. Anyone walking their dog at 4:00 a.m. is clearly a sociopath. It obviously has to be the CWK. No, it's Chris. -Wait, what? -Yeah, the scream. The van coming and going at the exact time as the killings. The fact that we haven't had a murder since we moved in six months ago. Sorry, you think Chris, crafty Chris is the Clockwork Killer? Yeah, I think like we spooked him at first, but now, everyone's let their guard down. I heard her. I heard her scream. Do you think she's still alive? -Yeah, well, for now. -Oh. What? Yesterday, you said you missed this stuff. The attention, yes. Staring won't give you the power to see through my uniform. What? Uh, you should definitely go to the cops. No! What would I say? Like, "Hello, Officer. I know who the killer is. We share a hedge." -But if you know something-- -No. They get weirdos on these cases all the time. Attention seekers. And I'm obviously not that. -No? -No! Besides, I need some kind of concrete evidence. You're still free tonight, yeah? Oh. You do know it's a Friday night, right? Oh my God. Uh, what about Sunday? I can do Sunday. Sunday will be too late. He hunts, he captures, he tortures, he kills. Then he calls to tell you where he's left the body. All in a three-day timeframe. Now, you're already running out of time. And let's be clear, Susan Miller is missing, and at this stage, there's no evidence to suggest -anything-- -In cases like this, we know time is an important factor. - This is Dhara Mallick. - She's a specialist profiler with the State Behavioral Analysis Unit. And she will be assisting me with this case. Do we have a serial killer on the loose? It's premature to speculate. Detective, we're heading for four double murders, yet you won't call the perpetrator a serial killer. - Why is that? - We're still working -to locate Susan alive. -We know the suspect is trouble. -This is the one person... -Mom? Door was open. Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you. You know what they say. If you're not early, you're late, right? Mom's still getting ready. He's simply stating that any assistance the killer can give us now will be... Couldn't get sleep last night? Hmm. You know, I was a sleepwalker when I was a kid. Never made it to the front door, though. You outdid me there. Detective Mallick. What's the killer trying to say? He's angry. He's isolated. He's saying, "Look at me. I'm in control." Until we catch him. This shit doesn't help either. Oh, hi. Uh, sorry, am I late? Wow! You look incredible. Oh, thanks. Uh, so, what have you guys been talking about? - Sleep. - Murder. Murder? Nice. That's one of Amy's favorite subjects. Did you apologize to Chris for last night? Oh, no. Hey. To tell you the truth, I was awake anyway. All right. Um, well, don't forget to lock up. Oh, no, I'll be fine. It's not like the Clockwork Killer comes into your home and rips you from your bed. Gotta be out in your car, making out. -Oh. -Good to know. Anyways, the killer has a victim right now, doesn't he? Amy? Are you okay? Would you want us to just stay or-- No. Enjoy yourself. Okay. All right. Well, I won't be late. Okay, bye. Here's to both of us getting a bit of sleep tonight. Fucks sake, Lian! Oh, not the reception I was expecting. Well, can't you just use the doorbell? What happened to your Friday night plans? I felt guilty about wishing all of this on us again. I mean, what if it was me? Thanks, Lee-Lee. That's what friends do, they uh, cover for them, stop them from getting impulse tattoos, and save them from crazed serial killers. All right, then. Let's do it. Do what exactly? -Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. Ugh! Who lives like this? He says he's renovating. Well, you think as a serial killer, he'd try a little bit harder not to live in a dump. You know, throw people off the scent. Only one way to find out. Look, you don't know 100 percent that she's in there. Which is why we have to go in. Okay, this is not a normal teenage dilemma. Lian, seven people are dead. If we do nothing, it's eight. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I can live with that. But I can't live with being right and not doing anything about it. Coleman's right. You're really good with words. Thank you. Right, he's out. Let's go. Wait. And we know that for a fact? Yeah, he's at the movies. Oh. Squeezing in a Hemsworth film between maiming and dumping. His Friday night is already better than mine. -Wait. What if he comes back? -Well, then we'll hear his van. -Ready? -No. -Come on. -Ugh! Follow me. - Oh, it's locked. - Come on. - Ugh! - Come on! Ames, what can you see? Tell me. Shit! Dean! What are you doing here? You expect me to just wait like I'm an Uber or some shit? -Deadshit Dean? -Yes. Idiot Dean, who as it turns out, washboard abs and a car. I'm right here. -No, no! What about our plan? -She's not here, Amy. All right. Can we go? -Whoa, babe! -Don't "babe" me. - I'm bailing. - Ugh! -Okay, that's fine. Let's just-- -Go home, Amy. Go back to spying on birds. Lian! I can't do this without you. So, don't. -Goodbye. -Yeah. See you in the morning. All right. What the bloody hell are you lookin' at, you perv? Shit, shit! Hello? Amy speaking. Mrs. Chen? -Yeah. Lian came over last night. I don't know why she didn't mention it. Where is she? Well, she's here. No, yeah. She-- she stayed over. Yeah. Well, she's in the shower. But I'll get her to call you when she's out. Sorry to worry you. It's Lian. Do your thing! Hey, Lee-Lee. - Can you call me? - It's urgent. It's Lian. Do your thing! It's Lian. Do your thing! It's Lian. Do your thing! Amy. Sorry, I said next door. Next door. Detective, Nordhoff, I don't know why you're here. Amy and I, we know each other from a few months back. Is your mother or father here? No, my father's dead. I'm sorry to hear that. Amy, is your mother, Barbara, is she home? -No, she's working. -We're gonna need her number. No, I already tried her, and she didn't pick up. I don't know why you're here. You should be next door. She's trapped inside. She's inside. -She's inside there. -Okay. Let's start there. Who exactly do you think is in there? Police. If it's all right, can we look at the shed? Sure. I heard this noise. You know, I think it was like a ladder that went up there. Found this phone down there on the ground. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Well, she was trying to, uh, look through the window around here. Scrapped the, uh, window. We've spoken to Barbara. This has nothing to do with her. Your mom should be here with you. Why? She doesn't believe me anyway. About Susan or Lian? -I heard a scream. -You said you heard a phone. No. On Thursday night, I heard a scream. She mentioned that you've been having nightmares. No. I heard it. I definitely heard it. Dad! You've had a scare. We can see that. But just so we're all clear, there is no one in that shed or that house. What about Lian's phone? You were both over there, right? Trespassing. No. No, you're not listening to me. He kills people. He's the Clockwork Killer. Look, I think this has all been a-- a misunderstanding. -Okay, what about the timing? -The timing? The van returns just after the killer strikes. Is your mother aware you've been stalking her new boyfriend? I have to take care of her. I was worried she was getting involved in something illegal like-- like drugs. So, you also suspect him of running drugs? No, I-- I thought that. But no, it wasn't true. Now, I know that-- I know that he's the killer. Amy, could-- could-- could I borrow that? I understand you're trying to be vigilant, Amy. But every minute of police time wasted is a minute stolen from Susan. That is not something you wanna be responsible for, I am sure. Whatever you've got to say, I've already heard it. I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't leave you alone. Is that what this is? This is a cry for help. Is it just about you not liking Chris, 'cause-- Oh my God. He's a killer. Has he told you why he drives around in the middle of the night with no lights on? Oh, you've gotta stop this. Do you realize how damaging this could be for him? I don't know why you're defending him. You don't even know him. I heard a scream. Honey. That scream was you... Dad! ...when your father fell. And you've been hearing it for months. It wasn't a dream. Listen, the thing is, you've gotta realize it wasn't your fault. Okay? There was nothing you could've done. You know what? I think it's time that we went to see the therapist again. I just want you to believe me. Why is that so hard for you? I wasn't supposed to do this alone. That was not the deal. Lian? Lian? Amy. Lian's here in this house. I know it. Oh, you know it? Huh? Yes. Ah, well, here. You need help. Is that-- Where have you been? They've held me here for hours, all because of you. Just-- just listen to me. My mother's gonna kill me. Lian! Amy, your friend's fine. I just found out that her boyfriend got a bit hot-headed last night with some of our uniformed men, so they've kept him here overnight to cool off. Lian's been in jail? No. They-- they were just held. They weren't charged. And I'll explain it to her mother, so... Okay, can you just tell her that I'm really sorry? Just tell her to fuck off. Shit. Chris! Hello? -Hello? -Hey, I'm here. Oh, God. I'm so s-- so sorry. I'm sorry. No, really, I, uh... I'm terribly sorry about this whole... Amy. Amy, you need to think this through. -Why are you doing this, Amy? -I'm trapped in his van. -This is the third time. -He's dumping body parts. The bodies we've located aren't missing limbs. I-- I saw something. Speak to your mother, Amy. Please. For your own sake. Just please help me. Amy. Honey, do you want some tea? Listen, if you want me to stay away from Chris, I will. Ah, what the... What the fuck? Jesus. Please. No, hang on. I'm here to help. I'm here to help. Okay. - I'll be back. - Come back. Please. I'm coming back. I'll be back. Stay where you are. Stay where you are. Don't move! No! No! There's a... Release the girl. -No! No, no, no! -Release the girl. -Release the girl. -No! There a-- no! Amy! Amy? Susan's in there! Susan's in there! Susan's in there. Oh, she's dead! Susan's still in there - Susan's in there. - Susan's in there. One every four to six hours. Yeah, I remember. Yeah. Complete rest. Okay. All right. Well, thank you, Dr. Stuart. Thank you so much. Me? Oh, I'm fine. Yeah. No, I'll be fine. Okay. All right. Well, thank you. I'm so sorry. I don't know why I didn't believe you. I-- I just... I wanted to be sure that I'd made the right decision moving us. I just wanted us... I wanted us to move on. What if it had been you? Oh, I'm so sorry, my darling. I'm so, so sorry. -Mrs. Poyton. -Detective Reuben Knox. May we have a word? So, what about Susan? Were you able to find her? No. Um, and the-- the body parts. Uh, Detective Nordhoff told me there were body parts in Chris's van. Uh, Mr. Mancini had been poisoning possums. We suspect he was taking the bodies to the town's edge to avoid charges. A minor offense in the scheme of things. Possums? The forensics went to town on the shed and the van. The only DNA we found belonged to yourself, Amy, and Chris Mancini. Uh, I'm sorry. I'm not quite sure I-- I understand. Amy told me that she was-- Do you have any idea why Amy was in the back of the van? No. Uh, I'm not sure why she's been doing anything anymore. We're gonna need to speak with her. Once she's lucid. Okay, um, can you excuse me? I just need-- I need to just take a minute. Barbara, I am so sorry. But it's also my duty to inform you that the shot fired was fatal. Chris Mancini is dead. Mom? Where's Detective Nordhoff? Uh, Detective Nordhoff is off the case, pending an inquiry. An inquiry into what? A man was shot. Amy, this is Detective Knox. I promise we're gonna keep this as brief as we can. Why-- why are you doing this, Amy? I'm trapped in his van. This is the third time. He's dumping body parts. What were you doing in Chris Mancini's van? Did he threaten you? Did he make you go with him? -N-- no. -Amy. No. -Then how'd you get there? -I climbed. -Into his van? -Yes. You've been diagnosed with claustrophobia. I believe that was following an accident. It was after my dad-- Yet you still climbed into the van? -Yes. -Why would you do that? Why is he here? -Uh, I think maybe we should-- -Answer the question. He has hidden her out of sight. No, no, no. You've gotta keep looking. -Look harder! -Oh my God. Amy! You've gotta stop this. Chris is dead. I'm sorry. I... Help! Help! He asked me to keep an eye out. That's all. While he watched the birds. - Dad! - Help! There's lots of old mine shafts. "Keep an eye out." That's what he said. Amy! I should've seen where he was stepping. You can't keep your eyes off the track. Dad! It was a freak accident, miles away from anywhere. No one could've saved him. Amy! Me. I could've. And I didn't. There's... a... girl... I'm so sorry. Who's there? I know you're there! Hey. You're awake. There's someone here? No. It's just me. No. Someone's here. Who? Him. Sweetie, there's nobody there. It was just a bad dream. Come on. Come on. No, no, no, no, no. Mom, you have to listen to me. -There's a man there! -Amy, you're upsetting yourself. Mom, there's a man there! There's a man! Stop! Just give me my phone. - Just-- - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Give me my phone. No, you've been told that you need complete rest until you're well again. Well again? I am not sick. I am not saying things! You have a head injury. Now, you either rest here or you rest in hospital, okay? Good girl. Good girl. Come on. Sweetheart, it's all right. It's just me. - No. It's just me. Promise. It's just me. Amy? Amy? -Oh, sweetie. -He was here. Listen. Listen. I'm right here. Okay? No one can hurt you. Sweetie. It's okay. I'm right here. Lian? -You look like shit. -Thanks. So, you were really in Chris's van, and now, he's dead. Yeah. That's pretty much how it happened. -Did you bring it? -Are you kidding? Barbs practically frisked me on the way in. Kidding! Pretty sure this works. Dean's got this geek brother who knows this guy who... -It could be stolen. -Thanks. So... I'm sorry. The other night with Dean, how I reacted, it wasn't fair. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have dragged you into it. I really screwed it up, Lee- Lee. We're teenagers. We're all screw-ups. So bad that people die? Oh, you're acting like you're the one that shot him. You're not that badass. Okay, Lian. Time's up. Well, thank you for visiting. Get better soon. I'm literally dying of boredom without you. Better wrap that one in bubble wrap, Barbs. It's been over three days now. Why hasn't the Clockwork Killer called? That's not a label we acknowledge. Where's Susan Miller? Our search is ongoing. People are saying the Chris Mancini shooting may spooked the killer. Any comment? There's... a... girl... Susan Miller is still alive. That is so unlikely. The killer hasn't called in yet to say where the body is. Which means what exactly? There is no body. Does it, though? Chris was shot at the shed. So? So, that interrupted the killer's timing. How? He heard the cops. And... me. Oh, she's there, she's there! Susan's still in there. Shh! The killer heard me. They'll think you're crazy. That's why he came up to me. The killer knows that I know. He'll come after you again. Shit. Shit! Ugh! Amy, it's all right. Susan's still alive. I need your help. I'm locked in. What do you mean? Lee-Lee, please. I just need you to come back, and go to the house now. Are you serious? Next time, it could be you or me. You said this is what friends do. Ugh! This is a bad idea. Bad like good, right? We're here. Okay, go to the shed. The best way to find Susan is through there. So, do we like actually know that for certain or-- Chris was in the shed the night he was shot. He didn't go through the house. Lian? He didn't go through the house. Susan's alive. And she's somewhere in the shed. Remind me again why we're doing this. Shh. But isn't this guy dead? I mean, didn't the cops -blow his head off? -Just shush! We may hear her. -The cops didn't. -Yeah, like, obviously. How about another Chinese lesson instead? Oh! I don't even know where to start with how racist that is. Man down. Hey, John Wick, can you stop screwing around and just get us inside? Do I really remind you of John Wick? His dog maybe. Right. Um, are you happy now? There's nothing here. What was that? -Don't fuck about, Dean. -I'm not, I heard something. Hello. Abducted girl? I really need to get my license. It's Dean. He's gone. Dean! Lian, just get out of there now! It's Lian. Do your thing.- Yes. Hey, slow down. I'm not working the case anymore, Amy. I'm sorry, Amy. No, I can't. Listen. I can't help you. Oh my God! Mom! Let me out, mom! Mom! Let me out! Mom! Lian? Lian! Lian? Shh! You. You're the Clockwork Killer? Tick-tock, Lian. Jesus. I gave you my number. I didn't like the name at first, but it's really grown on me. What, failing students wasn't enough for you? You know, I thought teaching was supposed to be rewarding. Always too much talk, Lian. Like what I've done with the place? I used to play here as a child. Always thought it had potential. - Lian? Lian? - Amy! - Amy! Amy! - You're inseparable, you two. - Amy! - It's nauseating! Lian, Lian? Oh my God. Mom? Oh my God! Mom, mom! Mom! No, no, no. No, no, no. I've called the cops. They're on their way. You really think they'll believe you again? -Mr. Coleman? -Can I be honest, Amy? I'm a bit disappointed you're surprised. You were so determined to write the killer. To relate. "He finishes feasting, leaves me there, impaled high." "A warning, no." "A trophy." Is that what these are? Every great serial killer needs a calling card. I practically handed you your beloved butcherbird's signature move, and you still couldn't see it. You're planning on feasting on their entrails, too? When you and your mother moved in next door, I thought it was all over. What are you up to? But serial killer frenzy continued. I miss him. "When's the CWK gonna strike again?" Things were better when he was around. Even you were desperate to believe the killer lived next door. "Hello, Officer. I know who the killer is. -We share a hedge." -What? Shame about your mom's boyfriend by the way. I hadn't finished with him. Has he told you why he drives around in the middle of the night with no lights on? You framed Chris by taking his van. And yet you had him killed. I'd almost call that teamwork. There's a... No! Why would you do this? I suppose you want something relatable. A sob story about how I wasn't hugged enough as a child. -Smattering of daddy issues? -Leave my father out of this. But in truth, it's really quite simple. Bad people do bad things. Stay away from me! Amy. I heard a scream. There's two bodies in there. You better seal it off. Lian's gonna be okay. You know, you saved Susan's life. -And your mom's. -And Dean? Amy, nobody could've done more than you. You believed me. Yeah. Yeah, there's two. You know, I think it's about time we moved back to the city, sweetheart. Maybe you should try a dating app.
