"You ever on the job?" Shit. It's called making people feel good, so they'll cooperate with you. You should try it sometime. I'm sorry about that phone thing last night. I'm having a mid-life crisis. I don't want you calling at 3:00 a.m. Call Denise at decent hours. Decent hours? What's that? 9:00 a.m. to what. . . Dinnertime? 8:00 p.m.? I can't believe those guys. You never saw Joe Louis. In the bedroom. Louis? Where did you see him? MISS ALLEN: Way before you were born, in Chicago. Joe Louis. They called him the Brown Bomber. He was gorgeous. You want to take the lady outside? Getting a little crowded in here. Your prints, too, chief. So, what's this guy's name? James. . . Mackey. Mack the Knife. You know. . . When she was married to me, I was never going to die. We fight, we split, she goes to you. So it goes. Life is forever, right? What do I care? I passed my 20 yesterday. Everybody says retire. . . So. . . I feel mortal all of a sudden. Know what I mean? I say he's dead 48 hours. No. Look at the lividity. It's more like 36. Smells like 48. Smells like 36. I was just trying to get some attention. You know? I apologize. It was just. . . We're in the same squad six years. We don't so much as have a beer together. How the hell do you take my wife away? Hey. . . I didn't take nobody nowhere. You understand? You didn't treat her right. She walked. I didn't treat her right? She walked. You want to kick somebody's ass about it, you kick your own. Fuckface. I'll check everybody out, but truthfully, it boils down to grabbing the strange trim he got hooked up with. This guy's a swordsman extraordinaire. Could be a lady gets pissed off because they're in bed, he's. . . Starts moaning Mary instead of Gladys. Hell hath no fury and all that. How do you know the trim is strange? Maybe it's a steady. Strange. Know how I know? Records, 45s. Nobody whips out old 45s except on first or second dates, when you're doing "the wonder of me" thing. Getting to know you, so what do you do? Take out old records, show the broad you kept them after all these years, meaning you're a wonderful, sentimental individual. Who does that with somebody they know? Once you know them, who gives a shit? How you doing, chief? Hey. . . Working hard or hardly working? Little of both. How you doing? Okay. Was anybody else here? Maybe the mailman in the afternoon. I don't remember. There's a cable TV repairman. What's that, Cabletime? But he was down in the basement. Pretty much what I told you yesterday. What about ladies? See any young ladies? See any of them? You told me there was a sex parade. If I'm looking to see somebody in particular, I'll see them. But if I'm hailing a cab or in the package room. . . Okay. We'll talk again. So the emcee says to the first husband, "Where did your wife say was the most exotic place "you ever made love?" So this guy's thinking, right? He's got a brain like a frigging pea, but he's thinking. Finally he says, "In the butt." You get it? Hey, anybody do any work over at 365 West End Avenue Monday? I did. See anybody there not looking right? You know, freaked out, scared? Running like lost? I saw some ladies in the laundry room. Why? What happened? There was a shooting. If you remember, want to give me a call? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Come with me My love To the sea It's so good. It feels so good. Please. . . Please, don't! Excuse me. MAN: Hey! A toast. . . Excuse me.

Evelyn Woods School of Speed Revenge. No walking wounded. Fucking women! Hey, Grube, let me ask you something. Your wife, does she stick it to you? So what are you trying to say to me?

Let's go, let's go. Fuck it. "Silver moons "A lifetime of Junes "Old rock tunes" Who the hell are you? Wait a minute. What's my name? This isn't funny. What's my name? Jim Mackey. So you answered his ad in New York Weekly, huh? I don't know why I'm crying. I never even got to meet him. It's just so sad, somebody dying. So you wrote him, or you called him? I wrote him, and then he called me. Fate sucks, I swear. Hey, Gina, maybe you'd feel better if you took those balloons off. They're the only things keeping me up. Frank. The lieutenant said I could read the jacket on your case. Guess what? The prints match. The same doer. Ain't that grand? Well, I got one for you, my man. Your guy put an ad in a singles magazine? New York Weekly. Bingo to that. My guy's in there, too. "Silver balloons, endless Junes "Old rock tunes "Let me put it in your moon" Wire Paladin. Something like that. Want to hear my guy? "City streets beneath my feet "4:00 a.m. , the longest hour "The hunt goes on till the break of dawn "For love, the rarest flower" This lady, she's in the cross-hairs. Poetry lover.

Get out of here! Want to dance with a couple bridesmaids? Okay. Here's how we catch her. We put in our own ad. Say what? New York Weekly magazine. We put an ad in. 1 00 guys place ads in there a month. They get 30 to 50 responses each. That's 4,000 or 5,000 women. Do we go out with 5,000 women? Hell, no. We know she's into rhyming ads, so we put one in. Moon, June, spoon, sand dune. We set up dates with 30, 40, 50 of them. We take them out. . . Some restaurant, some bar, get prints on a wineglass, bingo! She's dropped. I love it. That's horseshit, but I love it. You know how many guys placed ads last month that rhymed? Three. She went out with two of them. Shit! We haven't chased down that third guy. Raymond Brown. 81 30 Austin Avenue, Kew Gardens. I tracked him through his postbox. You a fucking cop? Sometimes. Gruber. I'll catch up with you. How you doing? This 20-year thing, it's kicking my ass. I'm sorry. "Raymond Brown, downtown brown." Here we go. "Loneliness and silence "envelop a heart that pounds like thunder "All the love I have inside "is ripping me asunder "The city is a jungle of pain "but my love is from the soul" So be so kind as to answer this ad, and you can ride on my pole. Give the guy a break. This is a major lonely-hearts here. Major. Good afternoon, I'm detective Frank Keller. This is detective Sherman Touhey. Does Raymond Brown live here? Daddy! They're cops. What's up, fellows? What's the matter? Daddy, are you all right? I want to tell you something. I love my family. Raymond, no kidding, we don't give a shit. All we need are names of your dates and their letters. I don't have letters. Raymond, there's some psycho woman killing guys. I swear I didn't go out with them. I threw the letters away. I didn't have the heart to go through with it. Raymond, you take the time to make up this beautiful poem about loneliness and silence. You spring $300 to put the ad in the magazine. You spring another, say, five yards a month for some love nest in the Village, fifty bucks for the post office box. You're telling us you never went out with them? Raymond, please. You know what the worst part of being a cop is? All you hear from people are lies. "l didn't do it. I wasn't there. It's somebody else." Blah this. Blah that. I swear on the eyes of my children. FRANK: 30 sit-downs, 30 sets of prints. . . Miss Wrong, we got her. Upstairs gives us 300 for the magazine ad, we spring for a few vinos, a chef's salad or two, bag the wine glasses, it's over. What? Come on. "What? Come on?" Suppose I get my own money, buy the ad myself, we drop her, you pay me back like it's a bet? Suppose I set you up with my sister-in-law? She got great tits. Divorced, no kids, no cats. The lieu's sister-in-law, she sounds great. "l swear on the eyes of my children." We should've tailed him. We fucked up. He fucked up. Don't leave the restaurant. Don't lay a hand on them. Don't have intercourse with them. It's over. I'm not doing it. You converse, you get prints, and you split. You wear a wire. We'll have a sound van outside. Two-man backup at another table. Keep the restaurant receipts. I don't want to read about this in The Village Voice. What's with the backup and wire? What's she going to do, confess, shoot me? We're in a restaurant. To make me happy. Now, who's writing the ad? Who's the poet? "Roses are red "violets are blue "l got one yea-long "and it's all for you" "l got one yea-long!" Check it out. I got one, I got one, I got one! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Check this one out. "Windswept hallways in my heart "Echo the blackness of eternity" Get out! Edgar Allan Poe, this guy. I'll be sitting across from Morticia Addams. Thing. Gomez! No, she's a shooter, right? So, how about something like. . . "Many a girl has shot me down" "I've been shot before" "Shot me down" "Hot to trot, give Frank a shot" "l live alone "Within myself "like a hut within the woods "l keep my heart high upon the shelf "barren of other goods "l need another's arms to reach for it "and place it where it belongs "l need another's touch "and smile "to fill my hut with songs" Not bad, huh? It's a little corny, but it's good. Better than what we got. Just make that up, Mr. K? Frank's mother wrote that. In high school. 1 934. She was a goddamn beautiful person. Go ahead. Use it. She'd have liked that. SHERMAN: Good poem. Say it again. You guys are fucking slobs. And you're G.Q. Later, Frank. Oh, God. Pop. Come on. You stay here with me tonight. Come on, come on. Come on. Come. Come on. Come on, come on. Come on. That's it, that's it. Where are you taking me? Am I walking? I'm walking, I am. That's good. Yeah. You got the wrong guy. Shut up. Wrong guy. Sorry, Frank. Okay, kid, smell a shooter in there? I don't know, Gloria. I just got this. . . This hopeful feeling when I read your letter. It's just. . . I can't explain it. I'm a printer. Yeah. My own business.

Is he on, Bill? Yup. Okay, man. I look natural. You look good. Can I help you? Good evening, sir. Good evening. Chair this evening? Yes, thank you. Cocktail this evening? Yeah. What kind, sir? Bourbon and water. Bourbon and water it is, sir. Come back, now. Do you remember When we met? That's the day I knew you were my pet Can I get a little "Hi-de-hi" here? If I look half as good as you at your age, you got nothing to worry about. You look great. You're very sweet. It's just that I should've said on the phone that I'm the age I am. You look better than three quarters of the girls I know that are half your age. Did that come out right? Yes, yes, thank you. I'll buy that. I'll quit while I'm ahead. So. . . The lady would like another white wine? Yes, please. And I'm fine here. Well. . . What do we do now? Well, I tell you. . . I got to pick up my son in half an hour, and the timing's terrible. Should we have dinner sometime? Sure. We'll call. We? We? I said we? Yes. That's me. All day on the phone, it's "We this, we that," meaning my company, you know. I'll call. Check, please. I'll call you. Me. No, you won't. Oh, well. WOMAN: I don't know. I get this very weird feeling you're not who you say you are. There's something not right about this. What do you mean? Like what? You got cop's eyes. Cop's eyes? You look at me, I feel like I did something. Like you did something? Like what? My ex-husband was a cop. You're a printer? If you're a printer, I got a dick. Well. I didn't doubt it for a minute, baby. Think you could go for a babe with a dick? Depends on her personality, really. So, you're divorced, right? I said that. You got kids? Kid, one kid. A boy? No. A girl. You got a girl, right? You know, it's interesting, your coming from York, Pennsylvania, because in a way. . . You went from York to New York. You like the park, and I like the beach. You like movies, I like plays. You're a printer, I manage a shoe store. And I don't believe in wasting time on this stuff. You know what you know, and you go with it. You go with what? You're just not my type. Oh, well. I mean, you just sat down. Give it a little bit of time. I believe in animal attraction. I believe in love at first sight. I believe in this. I don't feel it with you. I'm hell on wheels once you know me. How you folks doing here? Is that wine okay, miss? You haven't even touched your glass. Have a little sip. You know, warm up. Let's raise a glass here. Come on, here. Let's have a happy hunting toast. It's nothing personal. Where are you going? Come on. Kiss my tiara, bitch. Look at that. I didn't get prints. How many more of these we got? Okay. That's two more. Two more. Oh, no. Oh, mercy, mercy, mercy. How are you doing, Frank? Okay. Anything on the prints? Nothing yet. How's your head? It couldn't be worse. Hey, how are you doing? Terry. Cabletone. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's up? I told your partner there was a kid there that day. A black kid. I think he was from the supermarket 'cause I saw him with groceries earlier on. Anyhow, I'm working down in the basement. About 20 minutes later, he tears through there like a bat out of hell. No groceries. I mean, why is he going out through the basement? There's a lobby, right? Anyhow, the kid has those. . . Those black militant corn holes, I mean, corn rows in his hair. He looks like a real shit-bag, if you ask me. How are you doing, chief? One of your kids got corn rows? You know, Afro hairdo? Stevie Wonder hair. Wonder hair? Reggie, he means Quawi. Where's he? Got me. I fired his ass Monday. How come? On a delivery, he doesn't like the tip, he screams at the customer. You got his address? Maybe. What did he do, kill somebody? Quawi. . . Quawi Benjamin. "Spooney." Call him that, he goes crazy. I got nothing here. He only worked like a week or so. If he comes in or you see him, call us. Sure. Hell on wheels, huh? How quickly we forget. No. I don't forget you. You're the "animal attraction," right? "Love at first sight." What, do you live around here? 88th Street. Oh, yeah? I live on 85th. You know that poem you wrote, you didn't write it. I read that poem and figured this is either a very sensitive guy or he ripped off some lady's poem. . . Or some girl's poem. You didn't write it, right? Nope. Some lady did, right? My mother wrote it some 50-odd years ago. That's why my father fell in love with her. Something like that. Is that true? So he says. I like that. I like that. . . That you did that. You want to hear my idea of poetry? Precision in life. Knowing when and how to make your move. Say your piece, like you the other night with me. Oh, that was. . . Poetry in motion. Beautiful. Beautiful. Look at me. What? You still want to go have that happy hunting toast? What happened to the animal attraction? What are you, fucking nuts? What if she's the doer? We won't get the prints back till tomorrow. Go out with her tomorrow night. Hey, come on, the doer's down south. Spooney, Quawi, whatever his name is. Listen, listen. This one walked. You remember her? You with that bitch who wouldn't even drink with you? Yeah. It's good in a way. I'll get her prints. By sending your dick to the lab? That'll be some great testimony, "You see, Your Honor, "first, I whipped it out, then she whipped it out." You catch my drift? How do you know it's this Quawi kid? It's probably a broad. You know that. She's a frigging suspect. Walk away. Frankie? Just walk away. Nothing to it, chief. That's it. I'm walking. Okay? See you tomorrow. No. Just a girlfriend. Yeah. All right. Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll talk to you later. Something came up, you know. Isn't that crazy? Boy. What's your name again? Helen. You know why I got married? I was 37. I wasn't married. So I got married. How do you like that? I can top that. You know why I got married? Some guy says, "l love you." I knew him a week. Playing hard to get? Yeah, right. We didn't last very long. Me, neither. The wedding lasted longer than the marriage. But we still. . . We're still friends. Sort of. You? Friends? No. I found out I was pregnant, I walked. You walked? What do you mean? The guy didn't know about the kid? No. He's out of the picture. You know, sometimes when I think about the people I got involved with, the choices I made, it's pretty amazing. But I found something out. There are very few mistakes that can't be corrected. . . If you got the guts. MAN: Last call. What, are they bombing us? Oh, hell. You know, when it gets late. . . Sometimes. . . I feel like a. . .big cat in a small cage. Oh, yeah? You know. . . I have done some desperate, foolish things come 3:00 in the morning. You mean like being here with me? Where's your bathroom? Over there. Where's my bag? HELEN: Get in bed. Jesus Christ. Oh, good Christ. Holy fuck. What the fuck? Oh, shit. Holy fuck. Oh, my God. Holy fuck. Oh, I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Oh, fuck. Jesus Christ. Oh, my God! Where did you put it? HELEN: Oh, no! No! No! What are you doing? Open the door! Open this fucking door! Open this door! What is it? This ain't real. Open this fucking door! It's a starter's pistol. I saw. . . You goddamn son of a bitch! Easy, easy. Don't you ever fucking put your hands on me! I got scared. Tell me about scared. . . What are you doing with a starter's pistol? None of your business! Get off of me! Listen. Listen to me! I saw the gun sticking out of the purse. I freaked, okay? It was a reflex. Feel my heart. Go ahead. It's like a drum. Feel it? I'll tell you some stories about scared sometime. You don't know. This city, what it does to people. I can't apologize enough for that. I don't know. I got this survival rush. You start to. . . You start to think with your hands, not your. . . Like an animal. I just. . . Did I hurt you? No. What? What are you looking for? What are you doing? What are you looking for? What are you looking for, huh? What are you looking for? Jesus. Oh, yeah. Jesus. What are you looking for? HELEN: It was too late to call you back. Yeah, just a friend. Okay, I'll be home. I'll be home when I get home. Man. You're killing me. Is that the sun? Are we still alive? I thought you were an insomniac. I am. I must have fainted. What are you doing there? I can't make you out. Helen, right? Come here. What? I got to talk to you. There's something I got to say. You're kidding. Are you kidding? I'll have to be airlifted to a standing position. But you, you're something. You go in the kitchen. You made coffee. What are you, Superman? Wonder Woman. What do you wonder about? How we made it through last night in one piece. Last night? Let me tell you about last night. Let me tell you. No. Yes. Cut it out. I'm going home to my daughter. Your daughter? She's with your mother, right? Your mother live with you? She's helping us out for a couple of weeks. I don't know about this. What's it like working in a print shop? A print shop? Yeah. Inky. What's it like running a shoe store? It's okay. But we don't live for our work, do we? No. I like to think I live for love. I mean, what else is there, food? You're something else. No, you're something else. You've no idea how many creeps are out there. You're wired like no one I ever met, but you're a good man. You never know. I always know. Or at least I find out. What do you mean, creeps? Manipulators. Liars. Guys who wait till you're in deep before you find out who they really are. Then you're fighting for your life. Creeps. You asked. You got any cigarettes? You smoke? Sometimes. Does that bother you? What brand? I mooch. I think I'm out. Let's see here. See any jump out at me? I got to go. I like to be home when my daughter wakes up. SHERMAN: Hello. Keller here. She's still out there. No prints match up. So. . . So should we dust your dick? You know, cover all bases? Would you finish that sale? Help you with something, sir? Yeah, you got this in a sneaker? I was in the neighborhood, so, you know, I thought I'd come in. Why are you whispering? I'm whispering? Yeah. Sorry. I just want to talk to you. Okay. Have a seat. I'll be with you in a minute. What did you want to talk to me about? Well. . . I was going to ask you about something. About some of the people you've been seeing. . . Over the past month or so. You know, guys. It's none of your business. It is, in a way, my business. Yeah, and how's that? Well. . . Forget it. It's stupid. Forget it. Look, I don't sleep around, if that's what you mean. No, that's not it. Why don't you come over to my house tonight for dinner, and we'll talk? MAN: Yo. Lady. I was in here, what, six months ago, and. . . You had this beautiful boot. It was Rivoli, Ravioli, something like that. Vivoli. We're out of stock. Try back in two weeks. Look, can I help you or what, huh? What's your problem? Tommy, let's blow. The guy's a cop. Hey, hey. . . Let's blow. If I hit you, I get nailed for assaulting an officer, right? You piece of shit. Okay, what? You're a cop? Yeah. So? What? Pretty bad, huh? It's just too much for you. You let that scum in, but my being a cop is just too much. Let me tell you something about this. All these people in here, with their rocks and furs, they get robbed or raped, I'm suddenly their daddy. Come the wet-ass hour, I'm everybody's daddy! Hey, what do you think you're doing? What do you mean? Don't try to turn this around on me. You lied to me. You looked like the plague. Why did you say you were a printer? I always wanted to be a printer. Talk to me. For 20 years, I go out with people, right? I tell them I'm a cop. You know what happens? I'm a non-person. That's why I put the ad in. Look, you ever keep something inside yourself? But you know you'll let it out. I just want to get on solid ground with you. I wanted us to know each other before I told you. That's all I wanted. I wanted to bring it along slowly. So you're a cop, huh? I'm Frank. Okay? I'm just Frank. Don't lie to me again. I don't like it. Look at these. They're so soft. They feel like feet. They're very subtle. Wild, right? This girl, you know. . . My girl gave them to me. Got to wear them, right? Pretty jazzy. You know, look at these things. She works in a shoe store. You never did get her prints. She's not the shooter. This we know. . . How? I asked her. Golden Cadillac. Screaming Golden Cadillac. What makes it scream? Getting attacked by a White Russian. That's very clever. Make that two. Want yours screaming, too? You have very tight skin. You know that? That's 'cause I'm fat. It pushes it out like balloon rubber. Did you get that order? See you. I've seen eight women tonight. I bet every one made more money than me. That blonde. . . She was a school principal. How come none of these women are married? How come I'm not married? Gentlemen, anyone up for the island of lost souls? No, not me tonight, kids. What's the matter, Frank? I don't know. I'm tired. You tired? I'm going to walk home. Talk to you tomorrow, kids. SHERMAN: All right, Frank. Hey, how you doing? Did I wake you? Listen. . . Is your daughter asleep? You think you can get somebody to watch her? Good. What do you got on? Yeah. No, no, take them off. I was just. . . Sea of Love. What? You have Sea of Love. I haven't looked in those boxes in years. Why, do you like that record? Yeah, I like it. I'm saving them for my daughter. Probably worth a fortune by now. They'd fall apart on the turntable. You never play them, huh? I don't even know what's in there anymore. You want something to drink? Yeah. A lot of people keep records, huh? I should have kept mine. I had thousands, thousands of them. They'd be worth something now. You better go home before it gets light out. Okay. All right. I want you to see something. Oh, beautiful. How would you know? You didn't even look at her. What do you mean? I didn't want to wake her. I wonder what kind of father you would make. Me? I don't know. You know. . . Who wants a policeman for a father? She's got a father, doesn't she? She does have a father. Know what I mean? Go home. He's not dead. You're divorced, right? Oh, yeah. You mad at me? No. Okay. Okay. Fuck. Okay. Is your mother back? Could you stay with me tonight? Good. I've got something important to discuss. Okay? I'm taking you somewhere, so dress nice. Waiter! Can I call you back? All right. Okay. Take care. How are you doing? Something from the bar? I know you, that cop. You're a police officer? Did you get fired? This is Gina. What do you want? Just sit down. It's okay. This is Gina Gallagher. Hi, Gina. This is detective Sherman Touhey. She's good people. Hi. I'm gone. I feel like Betty fucking Crocker in this. Jesus, it's only 8:00 and I'm hammered. I'm staying here tonight. If I try to hit that highway, I'll die like a dog. It would make a nice headline. I'll call the wife, tell her I'll crash around here. Get a hotel or something. Go to the squad room. There's this nice cozy army cot there. I got extra keys. I'm two blocks away. We're sleeping together? I'm going to see this Helen later. I got this hotel suite. An ex-partner is security chief, so he owes me. It'll be a nice surprise. I'm asking her to move in with me. You just met her. I feel like a fucking teenager. The guy says to me, "Frank, retire." I said, "To what?" There's nothing out there after this. Could you get the waiter, please? Is there a waiter in this place? So, what's this important thing you wanted to ask me? What? Maybe you should slow it down, huh? Maybe the menu should come sometime this century. What's the big question you wanted to ask? I don't know. Waiter. . . Waiter. I feel like I got the London Philharmonic up my ass. Let's go. Come on. We just got here. I know. Let's get out of here. Bad choice. Okay. Not my favorite place. I love this neighborhood. I figure the worst that could happen is I'd trip over a Perrier bottle. Could get worse, you know. Nicey-nice, this neighborhood, huh? Hold it. Last year alone, we had three murders right in this block. See that garage? One in there. That building? Second floor. One in there. Two months later, third floor. One in there. This town's one big city of the dead for you, huh? What do you say that for? I love life. I'm just trying to share with you. When you live with a cop. . . There are certain things, you know, a cop's eyes. What we see. There's you, what you see, which is like nothing, and. . . Our eyes, our life, what we see. "If you live with a cop. . ." What? You said, "If you live with a cop." You mean if I live with a cop. Me. Have you thought about this? I have a kid. It's a whole family. You get that, right? I want to ask you something. The singles magazine. I don't know, you know? I mean the dates. How can you do that shit? I mean, you know, go out with guys like that. How can you do that? You do it. Did you forget how we met, Frank? What are you talking about? I was on a job. I was wearing a wire. We were going to drop somebody. I'd never do that for real. The part about the wire. You want to run that by me again? Let me just tell you. . . Fuck you! Wait a minute, now. I was just. . . Listen. I was just saying that. . . MAN ON TV: Here's the pitch. The ball's hit to center field! What're you having, Frank? Double Dewars, Pete. You got it. Oh, hi. Is. . . It's 1 :00 in the morning. I'm Frank. I know who you are. My mouth ain't working so good tonight, so. . . All I can say right now is that. . . The circumstances. . . Were the circumstances, and. . . No, that's not good enough. Okay. Okay. The whole thing is horseshit. Know what I mean? The wire, the job. . . There was no wire. There was no job, no nothing. I was just saying that to push you away from me. Because I was going to ask you to live with me. And I got. . . Scared, you know? I'm sorry. You know. . . You never even told me what your kid's name is. Sarah. Sarah? I would like for the three of us, you know, to go somewhere. Movie or something. Just. . .take it slow, you know? Helen. . . I can't even sleep in my own bed anymore unless you're in it. I mean, I need you to lie down with me. Otherwise, I'm just going to walk the streets all night. Oh, I'm so tired. You got to come lay down with me. Helen. . . I got these shoes here. See? Come back with me, please. Let me go tell my mother. HELEN: Frank. I didn't want to wake her up. I need some time to think all this through. I think I should be alone tonight. Okay. Catch you later. Shit. Sherman. SHERMAN: Frankie? Yeah. Frank? I forgot you were here. Scared the shit out of me. I'll stay on the couch. Weren't you going to a hotel? It didn't work out. What's he doing here? Is this his place? l. . . Look, I'll go to the station house. No. I got to talk to you. Frank, I never did nothing like this before. That's okay. No, listen. I got to talk to you about this. None of this was my idea. Gina starts rubbing my leg under the table. You threw me the keys. I told you not to. Want to go get her? Want me to get her? I'm sorry, Sherman. l. . . I'm sorry. Thanks, Frank. Take care. "Catch you later"? Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Is that some kind of brush-off, Frank? No, not at all. No. I got something for you. Oh, yeah? What? You were looking at this like it rang some bells. Please? Come with me Want to dance? Okay. To the sea The sea of love Got something for me? You got something special for me tonight, huh?

What kind of creep was he? That poor bastard in Queens? What's his name? Raymond Brown. You fucked him good. You've been following me around? Last chance. How long you been following me? I haven't been following you. How do you know about them? It's my job. It's what I'm paid for. I didn't sleep with those guys. They were just dates. Shut up! I slept with Mackey! Big deal!

I hear that. Wildest ride I was ever on. You know, I followed up that nut bag. The husband, Terry? Turns out he'd been shadowing her for eight months. Can you believe it? Jesus. Man. She always had that edge, you know? Like she smelled him, sensed him, or something. I must have sensed him, too. Wonder what she saw in him. I don't know. What does anybody see in anybody? People are work, brother. A lot of work. Too much work. Ever see her again? Well, I tried, but. . . She didn't want to. Can you blame her? I'm in bed with her, making love. . . I'm out of bed, I'm stalking her, like. . . She had that nutcase over one shoulder, me over the other. Come on. Can you blame her? Yeah, right. I'm going to let her go.
