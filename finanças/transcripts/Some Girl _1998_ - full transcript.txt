Claire, get off-- No! No! Claire, the drama is over. [screams] The drama’s over! No! I was fucking happy today, you know? I was fucking happy! My team made the semi-finals. We made it to the semi-finals today! Can’t you let me have my moment, huh? No. No fucking glory for Jeff, Claire, huh? No glory for Jeff! Sit down! Good-bye. [starts engine] [tires screech] I’m sorry, Jenn. Nobody likes me, Jenn. Ravi, come back. Ravi, wait. Wait. Jenn, I gotta tell you something. Jason-- Wait. Let me just tell you something. I just gotta tell you something really quick. Jason, I’m supposed to be babysitting Ravi. Now, what the fuck? Please just listen to me. I know he’s in there. Just-- Please. He’s fine. He’s fine. Did you forget your I.D. again? No. No. Can you spit it out? I need to go inside. Jenn... Jenn, I’m-- Jenn, I’m in love with you. I--I’ve been in love with you since the first day that I met you. May-- Maybe since the exact microsecond that I was fucking born and-- and into the future and-- and-- and that, you know, and that maybe-- that maybe infinity. But-- But... I don’t know what else to say. Can I go inside now? It’s very sweet. Thank you. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Mitchell, I’m-- I’m at this place in my life where everything inside me is exploding. I have to get away, and Italy just feels right. Now, it’s not gonna be forever, honey. It’ll just be till I can feel some independence, some culture. Mitchell, I love you, but I have to do something for myself, for Suzanne. What? No. No, hon. [laughs] Well, Mitchell... Okay. I’m gonna put this to you a better way, then. I’m breaking up with you. [gags] Oh, Neal, let’s escape the madness. I told you I’m working. I don’t get off for another hour. I hate you. Why do you say that? I need you to take me back to your apartment. Come on. You’re gonna get me fired. So? Uhh! God, that hit the spot. But, April, I didn’t finish. That’s all right. We’ll get to you next time. Will you lock the door on your way out? April, this is my house. Oh, right. April. Mm-hmm? April, I think we need to talk. [sighs] You know, about what we talked about? Oh. Yeah. Yeah? So what do you think? Hmm? Huh? What? April! April! What, Neal? What? You want to talk? Why do you like aggravating me? I’m content. I feel good. Whatever. [Claire] What do I do? Where do I go? I don’t know! Move on! Fuck you! I love you! Hey! Come here! I’m scared! [crying] I need you! I can’t be alone! Claire, we’re leaving. Come say good-bye. Claire, you father and I are leaving. Hello! Hello. You are my father. We are on. Okay. So, Clair, listen, uh, there’s emergency money in the top dresser drawer, but I gave Mike enough to last him while I’m gone. Don’t blow it all at once, sport. You didn’t give me enough for two weeks. You’re right. I gave you enough for five. Claire-- Are you feeling okay? You don’t look so hot? Dad, who’s gonna pay Rosario? Mike... be good. Be... good. There, that’s taken care of. All right. Where was I? Phone numbers. On the fridge. Please, use them in case of an emergency only, all right? Bye, Dad. Bye. Hi, Jason. You going on a trip? Yes, we are. Give us a hug. Jason! Son! Give us a hug. Make it official. How’s your mom? Great. That’s too bad. Hi. Hi. You must buy. Bro, I’m just browsing. Break seal, you pay. What are you reading? Bikini. Ah, yes. Spike Lee. What a character. What’s the name of that magazine again? Oh. Anything else? Hmm? No. Do you mind standing over there? Yes? Your hair. I know. It’s red, and I have really fair skin. Look, I was up all night, so could you not pick up on me right now? No, no, I’m not trying to pick up on you. I’m just-- I’m just intrigued. You’re not from L.A., are you? Well, that’s a very long story. I don’t think I can disclose that kind of information quite yet. Thank you. Uh, hot dogs. Can I buy you a hot dog? You’re intrigued, huh? Yes. Yeah, well, when he does his laundry, he’ll be looking for that sock. So tell me about this new guy. Um, his name is Chad. I met him at a magazine stand. End of story. Chad? That’s his name? Yeah. [sighs] Honey, Chads are the worst. Okay. Here we go. No, no. I’m just saying that Chads are bad news. I believe in the exceptions of this world and all that bullshit, but I’ve been dumped and dogged by too many Chads to not say anything. Let’s get cocktails. Good. Let’s go. I don’t get it. Okay, what? You do what? You do what? [sighs] You wrap your fingers around the base of the sac, and you lick all around. You know what you get. [laughs] [laughs] Whatever! It gets them off, and that’s all you need to know. Next. Jenn, seriously. You mean to say that in 22 years of innocence, you haven’t learned this? This is the basics! Okay, wait. Do you do this while or before you’re sucking on him? Oh, good. Now, there’s an intelligent question. Now we can get somewhere. Okay. And the answer to that is...anyone? Anyone? I don’t know. April? I’ll say either for 200, Pat. Beautiful. If you’ve already started sucking him off, and you want to go back and do the sac thing, you never break the rhythm. You always transition your hand into stroking your partner before you head for his balls. And also, Suzanne. What? Don’t be afraid to experiment. Like what? Like using the teeth. People think teeth are bad. That’s not necessarily so. Teeth are your friends. Teeth are danger, which equals excitement. It’s nothing like it. Let me see your teeth. See, that’s a mouthful of potential right there. Just try it. They get this glazed look in their eyes. It drives them crazy. And then they say to you, they say, "April. God, where’d you learn how to do this, baby?" And you say, "Jenn taught me." [gargles] [Suzanne] You’re vile. Eww, Jenn. [Bartender] Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. [all] Last call for alcohol! Earl, what are you doing later tonight? [Earl] Hey, baby. [telephone rings] [ring] Hello? Hi. Who is this? Chad, from the magazine stand. Who is this? Who do you think it is? So how you doing? Fine. How are you? Good, good. And you? I just told you I was fine. I know. I realized that, and I was hoping maybe you wouldn’t notice, so-- Claire, hey, guess what. I just finished my first sculpture. You sculpt? Nope. I’ve only done one sculpture. Oh. So I’m talking you out. Really? Where? Well, I’ll pick you up and we’ll just...go. Whatever. Okay, so I’ll see you tomorrow night. Okay. Um, do you wanna know where I live? This right here is the labia majora. This is the labia minora on the inside. This is the access canal. [squeals, giggles] What’s wrong with her? I don’t know. [Claire screams] And this is the marrow of personal achievement-- the clitoris, otherwise known as the clit.

[car door closes] I’m obviously picking her up from some one-night stand. I’m supposed to act like nothing unusual is going on? Like I’m picking her up from work or something? This is wrong, Claire. I’m dating a hooker. She’s an honorary hooker. April is evil. She’s not evil. She’s-- She’s confused. I know she longs for stability in her life. Neal, Neal, Neal-- I’m gonna tell you this once and forever hold my peace. April is a selfish, man-hating, man-eating reptile. That’s not true. It is true, but...I love her. Because you can’t have her. That’s not entirely true. Okay, then why are you in love with her? Because I’m in love with her. She’s wild. She’s... I love her voice. I love her-- her eyes. She’s...intellectually stimulating. What? I’m just making sure you’re listening. I’m listening. Why can’t someone say those things about me? I-- I would say those things about you. You don’t count. Do you know one time I got crabs from thrift-shop clothing? Are you sure it was a thrift shop? Yes! [clears throat] Hey, have you talked to Neal at all? I told him you’re evil. What? [laughs] Claire, that’s really good. I-- I keep my distance, yes, but I’m not evil. What did you say? You’re breaking his heart, April. No, he’s breaking his own heart. He has to realize I’m not always gonna be there for him. Yeah, but when you need him, he’s there. What a second. Whose side are you on this? I just like having fun. Is that such a crime? I don’t know what’s wrong with people. I gotta be completely honest with you. I’m completely attracted to you. No holds barred-- Humor me. Tell me what you think. Just be completely honest, be completely candid. Tell me what you think about me? Honestly? Yeah. I think you’re disgusting. What do you think of this dress? Um, no. I think you should show your body off a little more. Like one of these would be nice on you, Claire. You’d see my crotch. You wear underwear. I plan to. Are you gonna buy those? No. I’m that close to bursting out in tears. So do you think this guy’s really worth buying a new dress? I don’t know. I’ll find out. Okay, so are we gonna leave, or are we gonna move in, or what’s going on? Are you on amphetamines? ’Cause you’re really annoying, Jason, in that special buzzy way, you know? That’s completely original. Great. [laughs] So where is he gonna take you? Do you know? I’ll find out tonight. I hope it’s someplace nice. [sighs] Is this where you take all the girls? No, you’re the first. My clothes weren’t dry, and I didn’t want to be late. Well, as long as I’m your first. Yes, the first and only. So where to now, the supermarket? Ha ha! I like that, but, uh, no. The restaurant will do. Hi. Hi. Hi. You’re not offended, are you? I haven’t had time to think about it. I like you, Claire. Claire, I like you. Look, all I’m saying is you shouldn’t be working for me, Jenny. You’re too fucking smart. God, I don’t know what I’d do without you. You saved my life. You know, I was thinking last night. You wanna know what I thought? Yes, Ravi. That you are a hell of a lot more talented than I am. I mean, I should know. It’s fucking me, isn’t it? Wow. Hola. Oma? You know, I’ve been watching you all night. Really? How’s that feel? Uh, pardon me. Is this guy bothering you at all? Who the fuck are you? Who the-- I’m your worst fucking nightmare, dick breath. Why don’t you go back to your fucking drink over there? She’s my fucking girlfriend, all right? Since you put it that way. Uhh! Oh, come on. Peace, guys. Hey, fuck you, lumberjack! You know, I’m not-- I’m not offended. How you-- What? How you kissed me. I thought about it, and I’m not offended. Oh. Oh, good. I mean, it’s not like you shoved your tongue down my throat. Yeah. Yeah, right. I mean, sexual tension, you know? You gotta deal with it. You get rid of it or it grows into this thing, you know? I know. Maybe that’s why I never date. I get paranoid and uncomfortable, and it’s like you barely know the person you’re sitting right across from, and you’re like-- Can I smell your hair? Yeah. [laughs] [laughs] I want your hair to cover me with maps of new places. So that everywhere I go will be as beautiful as your hair. Richard Brautigan. Oh, shit! You know him? Yeah, very well. What is that one poem? That one-- I love this poem. Um, it’s never having had it so gently-- I’ve never had it done so gently before. Yeah, right, right. The sweet juices of your mouth are liked castles baked in honey. I’ve never had it done so gently before. You put a circle of castles around my penis, and you swill them-- Like sunlight on the wings of birds. Wow. What a coincidence. Are you a Sagittarius? No. Me, neither. You want to come in for a minute? I can’t. I want to, but I can’t. I gotta be in Nevada at 6 a.m. tomorrow-- Or today, actually. Are you doing some gambling? [laughs] [laughs] No, actually. I’m doing a K-Mart commercial. You do K-Mart commercials? This is my first one. Well, okay. I guess this is good-bye, then. Hey, I’ll call you the day after tomorrow-- Or I guess tomorrow-- I’ll call you when I get back. Friday. Jesus, you are brilliant. I could have just said Friday. Okay. Good-bye, Chad. [groans] Hi. Thank you so much, Suzanne, for getting me. Oh, my God! What happened to your forehead? [coughs] What? You have, like, a-- Look! Oh, man. I guess the bedpost must have hit it. It’s really that obvious? No. No, no, no. No. Oh, man. It wasn’t that hard, Claire. I shouldn’t have a bruise. I’ve never had this happen before in my life. Maybe you bruise easily. Are you taking enough iron? I don’t know. I have to try that. Where’s Chad? Isn’t he supposed to meet you here? Claire? Chad. Oh, God, I’m so glad you’re still here. Oh, my God, This is destiny. My car runs out of gas. Okay, so my gas gauge is all messed up, and I’m, like, telepathically zoning to you to stay here. Well, I’m just glad you showed. I’m so glad you’re still here. This is-- Your hair. We’ve met, haven’t we? Hmm? You have? I think so. Uh...right. Oh, Ben’s roommate over on 4th, right? 4th, yes. Yes. Wow. Small world. Where were you last night? What happened to your head? Excuse me a second. Hi. Hi. You look beautiful. Neal-- Neal, okay. Okay? What? This whole commitment thing is not gonna work right now. Commitment? I didn’t know that you’d even taken it that far. I just don’t understand why you’re such an inconsiderate flake. I’m not inconsiderate! Oh, yeah? Yeah! I have a lot on my mind right now. On top of the fact that this serious relationship thing, it totally cramps my style. Fine. We need to talk. I just wanna iron this situation out once and for all now. Let me ask you a question. Do you want to spend your nights and days riddled with guilt because you’re suffocating me? You’re totally limiting my social life. I’m suffocating you? That’s nice. Is it over? Why don’t you just tell me if it’s over? No, it’s not over. That’s not what I’m saying. I’m just saying go back to work. Call me later. When should I call you? You’re never home. You don’t call me back anymore. Sweetie, can you make this any more difficult? I’m sorry. I’ll call you. When should I call you? I love you. I love you, too. I really do. It’s just... It’s not that, you know, shaving your legs daily kind of love, that "I’d quit smoking for you" kind of love. That Everlasting Gobstopper kind of love. [applause] Yeah. Well, what is it? I don’t know. Just call me later. "The sea is me, you are my son, "a cure to thee, a heaven to be. "Would you like a dose of eternity? "I’m smitten sweet will give it to thee in tomorrow’s conversation."

I mean, I thought later last night. What time is it? Mike, go see what time it is. Please, Claire, no-- Mike! He already said he loves you. What’s there to worry about? Yeah, but the "I love you" thing. You never trust a guy who throws the term "I love you" around loosely. Guys like that lack passion in their lives, and they’re not thinking about the girl they say it to, and what it makes her think. It’s 1:32. It’s 1:32, Claire!

I got this important audition I’m preparing for. Oh, no, no, no. I was just in the neighborhood, so I thought I’d stop by. It was just-- It was kinda weird the last time we saw each other. When, last night? It wasn’t weird last night. Okay, well, maybe it wasn’t weird, but you haven’t called, so I thought something was wrong. Claire, I just woke up an hour ago, okay? Well, maybe we could do something tonight. Um... yeah. Yeah. Uh, actually, I’m gonna stay in tonight. I got this throat thing. Are you sick? No. Well... I’m sorry. Look, I just wanna feel good for my audition tomorrow. Well, maybe we could do something tomorrow night. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so I’ll call you tomorrow night. All right. Thursday night. I could have just said Thursday night. Bye. Fuck! Neal. Hey, Claire, how’s it going? Fine. How are you? I’m good. What are you doing here? I’m grocery shopping. In the feminine hygiene section? Yeah, well, you know how it is. My mom asked me to pick up some, um, some Monostat 7. Nah, she-- She didn’t tell me to pick it up. She doesn’t have a yeast infection. I mean, if she does, she probably wouldn’t-- No. Hey, have-- have you spoken to April? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. I haven’t spoken to her. If you talk to her later or something, can you tell her that I, um... that I say hello and I love you and-- Neal, I’m gonna give you some advice. Advice is nice sometimes. You can take it or leave it. But April is fucking with you. She’s stringing you along. I think you should save yourself some dignity and move on with your life. Is that it? Yeah. Thank you. It’s not that I don’t think it could lead somewhere. It’s just I decided that it’s best if it doesn’t. Yeah? The commitment issue’s been exhausted, you know? I wanna make a clean break and breathe a little. Oh, completely. Yeah, I completely understand, Neal. I can see where you’re coming from. Good. I mean, you understand-- Oh, yeah, totally. So do you want to figure out how to... get your stuff out of my apartment? Let me just ask you something. Why the sudden shift in attitude? I’m curious. Hmm? Huh? When you guys first broke up, did he cheat on you? No, no. It was only for, like two days, and he came running back with flowers. Plus, Mitchell’s not one of those guys that can get laid just like that. I think he give most girls the creeps. I love flowers. Mmm. Claire, darling. So what’s with you advising Neal to break up with me? He broke up with you? Yes, he did. Wow. Good for him. Good for him? Why are you all of a sudden interested in my love life? First, I’d be careful in calling it a love life. Second, Neal is my friend. I thought I’d crack the door, let a little light in. I’d do the same for you, April. [laughs] Really? Ooh, this is good, Claire. Let me just absorb this. You’re wrong for Neal. He deserves better, something a little more dignified. You know, you’re right, actually, ’cause I thought you and Neal would make such a good couple. No. No, no. I would never fuck my best friend’s boyfriend. Hmm. I would. Hey, can I interject here for a second? Yeah, sure, Jason. Go ahead, interject. We’re dying to hear you. Just by rare chance if you might find yourself in the same room as a dictionary, why don’t you look up the word devotion? And, uh, you know, while you’re at it, you can even check out some of the synonyms, like, uh, faithfulness, or loyalty, or fidelity, or-- monogamy’s a good one. Wow. This coming from someone who’s never even had a real girlfriend? No, no! Oh, God, no! Coming from someone who’s never been a real girlfriend. Oh, Jason, you sure you’re only 5’5". You know what? Merely because I’m one of the two guys in our graduating class that you did not go to bed with, that doesn’t mean I haven’t been around, April. I’ve been around. I’ve been approached. I’ve been stopped. I’ve been sought after by-- by women who-- who make you look like what you look like. 6’2" and-- [laughs] Good for you. You’ve been around. Good. What’s the point? Hey, you know what? Let me ask you something. How does it feel to have the biggest pussy known to mankind, huh? You’re really trying my patience, Jason. That’s really funny. Yeah, well, you’re looking a little spent there. Listen, you little faggot. You want me to drag you out by your puny little cock and take away what manhood you have left? ’Cause I’ll do it! What are you gonna do? Are you gonna blow me to death? Oh! Ugh! Are you okay, Jas? No. Here. Ow! Ow! Ow! I hate her! I hate her! She’s so bitter, and she’s so contemptuous. She’s just like a--- What did I do to make her do that to me? She’s a... [laughs] Oh, God. I’m drunk. I’m deformed. No, you’re not deformed. It’s good. It’s sexy. It’s a black eye. Really? Really sexy. [mumbles] Uhh! Oh, fuck! [vomits] Ugh! What’s the point? Who cares? The guy’s a joke. Oh, but he’s so sweet. You’re crying. Sorry. No, don’t apologize about that. Claire, risk it all. Just fucking jump in. That’s what I did with Jenn. You pledged your eternal love to her, and she completely blew you off. Yeah, but see-- No. No, that doesn’t matter. Because you know why? You know why? Because it was worth looking like an asshole. I mean, what if she felt the same way, and she was just too shy with me? Jenn too shy? Yeah. Okay, right. No, I guess she wasn’t too shy. Okay, so now I’m really depressed. [both laugh] Hey, uh... do the model poem. You want me to do that? Do the-- Do the model number. I’ve got spirit, I’ve got zest, I do commercials for Tampex and Crest. I’m beautiful and slender with silicone breasts. My measurement checkups always pass the test. You see me in magazines. You watch me on TV. Don’t you freaks wish you were me? I make bush-loads of money. No talent, no brains, while poets and artists go slowly insane. I’m the American Dream. Every man wants me. I share myself with the world It’s ecstasy. Shopping, the gym. My fiancée’s parents are coming for dinner. Tanning salons, bikini waxes, endless appointments, diet-pill stashes. Don’t you wish you were me? [sighs] That’s the fourth time you’ve spelled penis today. Now he’s gotta go get someone to touch it. You got some serious issues, yeah. Hey, guys. Greetings, Claire. What’s up? Not much. We’re really entering a new realm of Scrabble, though. We’re going on our fifth straight hour. Where’s Chad? Queef? Dude, that is so slang. Proper word. Challenge. Wait, before you guys get too deep into this, where’s Chad? Upstairs. Uh, listen, Charlene or-- Wait, what is it? Claire. Yeah, is queef not a word? ’Cause you’d look like you’d know. Uh, no comment. You’re wrong. You’re wrong. You are so wrong. It’s so far from being in the Scrabble dictionary! So you’re saying it’s slang. All right. In order for something to be slang, it had to be slang before something. [talking continues] ♪♪ [opera playing] [passionate moaning] [Man] You’re fucking crazy!

We can talk about this, all right? You ripped my-- my heart out and swallow it whole, and be so bold as to offer me tea? Well, it all depends on what you have. Let me guess. Lemon Zinger? No. No? Fucker! Aah! God damn it! Fucker! How about Good Earth? Good Earth? Yeah, yeah. I think we have Good Earth, okay? Just put the gun down, we can talk. Cinnamon or regular? [cocks gun] I don’t know.

I guess I deserves this. Claire, it doesn’t always click. Claire, you should really come inside. Ow! [knock on door] [knock] What? [Mike] Claire, it’s Suzanne. I’m not home. Take a message. She’s not on the phone, she’s here. [Suzanne] Claire, I’m coming in. God! Stop! Jerks! All right, crazy Claire, what happened now? Nothing. It’s official. Well, come on. I’ll kick his ass later.

We’re getting your ass out of the house. What the hell’s taking so long? What the hell is that? Oh, my God! Hey, sugar! Nice, Claire. That’s a good look. Let’s get cocktails. The point I’m trying to make, Jason, is that you are a realist, whereas I am an idealist. That’s exactly how we’re different. That’s how we differ. You’re drunk, and I’m not. Okay. Let me-- Okay? Mm-hmm. You think, therefore you are. I think, therefore I is--I am. I am. No difference. There’s no difference in what you just said. Do you see what I mean? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay? Okay.

Okay, she opens he beloved journal. [laughs] Wouldn’t you know? It’s Chad and Claire. How you doing, Chad and Claire? I hate him. He’s a bad boy. [laughs] Won’t be needing this. You’re lighting it on fire right now. It’s on fire. It’s embarrassing. Put that out. Mitchell, hi! April. April. April. Yes, Claire? Come here. I gotta talk. This is my friend Stephen. Stephen, can you give me one moment with April, please? One moment? She’s really rude. One moment. What? I have something extremely important to tell you. That’s fine. Because I have something extremely important to tell you. Okay, listen, listen. I-- I fucked up, okay? I did. I’m a bad person. You are good. I didn’t mean to say those things to Neal. And it’s my fault. So fucking-A! I just don’t see how you can piss someone like that away. Why don’t you have another drink, Claire? It’s on the way. Um, I’m gonna throw up right now, and I’ll see you in a minute. Chad fucked another girl. What? That’s terrible. [high-pitched voice] Hi, April! Shut up, Jason. [gargles] [spits] [spits] Claire, are you okay? I’m good. I’m really... really fucking good. Are you sure? April, has anyone ever loved you? I mean, not your blowjobs or your facades, but I mean really loved you? Like unconditional, all the way. Like-- Like... in a soulful way? I don’t know. ’Cause I haven’t had that. [sniffles] Is that all right? [crying] I mean, is now the time for me to grow hard and not ever care, not ever want it? No. No, Claire. Maybe you did have it, and you just didn’t see it. Oh. I thought what I had with the Chad guy was real. I mean, I thought we both really had jumped in together. But really I was just swimming in my own piss, and he’s on the diving board fucking some other girl. Okay, Claire, listen. Listen to me, okay? Just--You have to pull yourself together, okay? This isn’t-- This isn’t you at all. There’s plenty of guys out there that would love to be with you. He doesn’t know what he’s missing, all right? Listen, just keep your cool, Claire. It’s the best revenge. I know. I know you know, ’cause you know everything. Happy Halloween, everybody. I’d like to have your attention. I’d like to remind you that this is a bon voyage party for our dear Suzanne who is off to Italy, where the real men are. Are we even invited? Claire’s party. Get that space! Hey, hey, hey!

I’m not trying to make you jealous. Yeah, well, it’s the thought that counts. Hi. Hi. [clears throat] Claire, it was me. I slept with Chad. I just thought you should know about it. I’m meant to assume this is recently, as in the night before last? Yeah, I don’t-- Enough. Enough. But may I commend you on sinking to such an astounding depth, or would that be pushing the issue? Claire, would you just let me-- April, get out! Neal was all I had-- Just leave! Please! You made him break up with me! Leave! I’m trying to tell you that I’m sorry because you’re my best friend!

About what? Everything. This whole past year, our relationship... I don’t think you can call what we had a relationship, April. I’m not as ungrateful as I act, you know. I mean, do you think I don’t see who you are? I mean, do you know that I think you’re a beautiful, special, compassionate person? [crying] That’s what I think of you.
