Hey. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Yeah. Okay, match point. - Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. - Mister Blue, Mister Kahn. - Sit down Ruben. Any man who actually works at a job is welcome here. - What's wrong with him? - No meaning in his life. - I want a relationship. - Why? He's got his old man's business with all the beef that goes along with it. A new Seville, a house in the hills. - I'm not happy. - Why not? - You think selling women's sportswear is satisfying? - I drive a bus. - I work for my father. - You know what your problem is, it's your name, Eli. Maybe if your name were Mike or Bill, maybe. Did you ever wonder why you weren't named Ramon? Max Eli, that's your father's name, and what did he name you? - Eli. - It's not too late to change it, Ed. - What's so hot about your name? - Blue. - Hello? How can we make this deal? Charlotte, I've gone back to my people twice. They don't want the, I wanna make the deal. They said the bottom line was 10, I got 'em to eight. They hate me. - I'd rather shoot myself, you want the goods? - Hi, Cyd. - Thanks, Candy. I'll call you. - Bye. - 50 navy, 50 whites. Marta? Don't burn the blazers. Next time you can be on top. - I want a bed. - If I got you a bed, you'd want a couch. And what's wrong with that? - Then a Cuisinart. - It's not the things, Blue. I'm 30 years old. I want more from you. - This is what I do. - What about me? - You knew who I was when you moved in. - Other artists live like human beings. - Name one. - King. - He's a whore. - His new show is brilliant. - Hasn't opened yet. How'd you see it? - We had lunch. - When? - Last week. - Where? - West Beach, what difference does it make? - Well, why didn't you tell me? - I'm telling you now. I had lunch with him, I didn't fuck him. - It's the same thing. - I'm not kidding, Blue. - If you're not happy, leave. - You would fall apart if I left you. - I would not. - You're such an asshole. Do you want an orange? - Yeah. Do I touch you enough? - What? - When we make love, do we communicate? - After five years you ask me. Yeah. - Hey, Blue? Where you going? It's not even midnight. - I can't do it anymore, Marvin. - What's the matter, you need a couple of bucks? - Hey, 15 years I studied art. - You're the best, bro. - This is filth. They ought to lock us up for printing this. - I'm a printer, I print. - I gotta get serious. - Do you believe in astral transport? - What is it? - It's an out of body thing. - You smell nice. - It's the fruit. I only eat fruit. - Do you wanna have children? - Not tonight. - I wanna have them while I'm young, but I don't think I'm ready. You should have them with someone you love. Are we about to have sex? - You want to? - I don't know you that well. - Well, only if you feel good about it. I guess we are. I don't believe in orgasms. - What? - I believe that sex should be an exchange of energy. - You don't come? - I don't wanna lose the energy. - You don't mind if I do? - You wouldn't have to if you gave up meat. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - I quit my job. - You what? - I've gotta change my life. - Cyd's gonna shit. - I did it for her. She wants security. - So you quit your job? - I've gotta get serious about my career. - A career is when you make money. - Why don't my paintings sell? - You paint pictures people are ashamed to hang in their homes. - I'm losing her, E. - No you're not. - She's slipping away. - Compromise, that's all she wants. - Compromise? Then I'm you. Great house, great car, great clothes, great women. - Small talk, great sex, and afterwards, nothing... maybe a little guilt. - You go out with someone and they spend the whole night telling you who they are. Boring. Well then at the end of the evening, you decide whether he's worth fucking or if it's been a total loss. You know if it's any good at all, you'll never hear from him again. - Why? - He's terrified. - Of what? - Involvement. You don't know how lucky you are. I hate dating. No offense. - Let's go to Fatburger. - No, I should go home. - Call Cyd, we'll pick her up. - She's gotta get up early, I don't wanna wake her. Then let her sleep. - No. I should go. - Sex isn't everything. - I'm Blue. - Cheer up! - The fruit cup? - Yes. - So, what now? - I gotta get a show. - How do you propose to do that? - I'm gonna get more aggressive. - Is that possible? Four years ago, Blue had a show. He beat up the Times critic. - I didn't beat him up. - You had to be forcibly restrained. - Don't make it sound like a big deal. - You went to jail. - What do you do? - I teach. - Aerobics, I met her at a class. - Hey, you need more time? - Yeah, about 30 years. - I know what I want. - Yeah, few men do. - Two chili cheeseburgers, fries, and a fruit cup. - To drink? - Coffee. - Water please. - Coffee. - Cook, two chili cheeseburgers, a fries and a fruit cup. - I'm sorry. - They weren't necessarily on a date. - Oh, I think they were. - I'm sorry I lied. "- That's all you're gonna say?" You tell me you didn't fuck him? - I'm leaving you. - For that asshole? - Be by myself. I need to be on my own. - I know you, you don't leave unless there's someone else. You can't be alone for a minute. - I've been alone for the past five years. I'm alone when we're together! When you're painting, you don't know I exist. - You used to like that. - I admired it. I wanted to be the same way, to have a passion. You know why? Because I didn't have any passion with you. - Will you have passion with King? - You cut yourself off, Blue. You've got to live in the world to be an artist. - What the fuck do you know? Do you call this art? - This paid your rent for the past five years, and your phone bill and the groceries, you son of a bitch! I loved you! - Don't go. - I can't do it anymore. I'll come back for the rest of my things. There's some things you have to know about the business. - How bad is it? - Bad. Don't say anything to your mother. You're a good boy, Eli, lazy but basically decent. Maybe you're right not to have a family. If I had to do it over, I wouldn't have children. A guy gets a call from his friend. "Hey, Murray, you made it!" I was scared stiff since you told me about the operation you were having. I've talked to 10 people and they told me they knew guys who died on the table. What? "It's tomorrow?!" - Dad, are you afraid? - Tell your mother to come back in, I know she's out there smoking. Talk to Ron. He's a good accountant, loyal. - Yeah. - Yes? - I want to see Terry Ray. - Is he expecting you? - Yes. - Does he know you? - Yes. We're army buddies. - I'm sorry, but... - Look, lady, I've been trying to see him for months. Now, I'm not gonna leave here until I see him. - You're making me hungry. - Hung... hungry? - Hangry! Just leave this, I'll see that he has... - When? - In a few months. - In a few months I could be dead. Je suis désolé (speaking in French) - You're not désolé! You call this an art gallery? Look what you have on your walls! You're Terry Ray. - Yes. - I'm Arthur Blue. I'm a painter. - Do you do bathrooms? - An artist. - Oh yes, I saw your show at Amando's. - That was four years ago. - I shouldn't wonder. Still doing pinups. Oh, that's based on- - Betty Page. - Yes. Circa 1950, what are the dimensions? - Three and a half by six. The model is Candy. - Candy Cane, submissive. Oh she's famous. My associate thinks that your paintings objectify women. - It's called art. - What was the name of her magazine? - Exotique. - Oh yes, she was the first real fetishist with style. How many of these do you have? I'm talking about a show, Mister Blue. I have an opening in, um.. in six weeks. I shall need 12, just pinups. I take 60%, deal? - I want a contract. C'est fou! (speaking in French) - That's all there is to it? - You deliver the paintings. Come back tomorrow, we'll have something for you to sign. Sexy. - You miss her? - This is a bad idea. - I was invited. - You're not gonna do something weird are you? - Weird for me or weird in general? I'm cool. Oh! Not cool, Blue. - I think it's great. It's great. It's great! - Thank you, Blue. - Hiya, Cyd. - Would you please do something? The poster is great, I love this poster. - Thanks, Blue. You know Chuck King, don't you? Eli Kahn. Chuck was just explaining to me the concept behind this stuff, how he thought of making all those little parallel lines cross. I think this is great. King, really. It's great. Everybody else thinks it's great too, don't we? Really, I mean, you could hang this stuff anywhere. It takes on the complexion of the room. It's like one of those little lizards, um... - Chameleon, that's what you're trying to say. - Yeah. Yeah. One more thing. How do you find the time? - The time for what, Blue? - Time to make all those little colored lines, and still fuck my woman. - Hey, darling. - You know, maybe you could paint something besides furniture, if you didn't spend so much time sneaking around. - Why don't you just say what you feel, Blue. - Hey, who you think you are, man? You can't paint or fuck. - Punch everybody out now. There's a dark cloud hanging over everybody that cares about you. Just grow up, for crying out loud! - You schmuck! - I can paint, can't I? You were incredible. I was, that was a great opening. I was magnificent. He was the asshole. I was fabulous. Come on, let's drink to me. Here's to you. - Who was that incredible woman with Terry Ray? - Answer that. - Great eyes. Great legs. - She's not your type. She's a militant feminist. Stop that? - I want to have her child. - Yeah? I'll be right there. - These are the top of the line. - We want something simple. - But elegant. - Just simple. He's dead. - Mister Kahn was an esteemed member of the community. He was also a leader of his temple. - What's the bottom of the line? I hardly think that would be appropriate. - This man left a business in trouble. We want something simple, wood, basic black, no jewels, no wheels. And if you try to put the bite on my friend, I'll pick one out for you. Is this one all right? - You really think my life would be different if I changed my name? - It's too late. You'll always be Eli. You thinking about your dad? - My mother. - Maybe she'll meet somebody else. - Where are we? - Open up just for a minute. - We're closed. - Just for a minute, please. It's important. Thanks, I want my friend to see the space. - Two moments. - Not everyone can wear leather. - You'd be surprised. I'm gonna do something really hot on this wall. Painting can be so much more than this. - Isn't it enough it gives you pleasure? - Like sex? Sex should be a monumental experience. Historic. Religious. - Like the crucifixion? - Please? You must leave. - Thanks. Looks different without the crowds. - And without the wine. - What's your name? - Liliane. - Perfect. - You're bearing up well. - I'm gonna marry her. - Cyd. - It's Eli. You're getting to be a real slob. - What time do we land? Oh! Oh! Oh. Where's my shirt? - Gone to shirt heaven. The trouble with you my friend, is you take this farkakte life too seriously. Develop a sense of humor. Relax, enjoy yourself! Shop somewhere else. - Hi. - Hi. How you doing? - Oh, this is... - Eli Kahn. - Nice, I'm Candy. - I'm a great admirer of your work. - Gee, thanks mister. - I'm trying to show my friend how to enjoy life. Can we take you to dinner? - Um.. I gotta get my groceries home. - That's okay, we'll eat at your place. I'm a fantastic cook. - He is. Go figure, a guy like you? - Hello? Yes I would, yes! I accept Visa and Master Charge, but now is not a good time for me. Could you call back late tonight? Yes, right over the phone. Bye. Business. - So you know Cyd? - Yeah. I don't think she likes me. - I introduced them. - Blue stole her away. - That's not exactly true. - She was my girlfriend. - You were fucking. - I met her first. - You meet everyone first. - Like Candy. A man'll never forgive betrayal. Women want Blue. He has passion, right? He's a romantic from another time. Lean, aesthetic. You're very cute. Yeah, you are. - I should go. Thanks for the dinner. - I should go. Dance. - It was a terrific dinner. - You cooked. - You stay. - What's with you two? - It's kind of awkward. We're both very attracted to you. And we both wanna sleep with you. - Subtle. - She wants us both. - Are you sure? - It was the shrimp. - Come here often? Go... go ahead. - Come up for a drink. No, no, I gotta get up early. Place is a zoo without Max. - I had a good time. - You forgot your groceries. Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Am I intruding? Why didn't you answer the door? My friends know it's open. - There's a lot of strange people in this neighborhood. - And? Warren Williams. - You killed me four years ago. - Suicide. So you appear to have been resurrected. Terry's excited about your new work. - I thought you'd at least wait til the opening. - You think I have nothing better to do than malign you, Mister Blue? You flatter yourself. I reviewed your show for what it was: A indulgent, pretentious, badly structured polemic, which we in the art world have no interest. - That's how you saw it. - The Times pays me a tidy sum for my opinions, and a great many people read them as gospel. - Not to their credit. - Not because I'm an uneducated pompous shrew. I spent a lifetime studying art, and attempting to help people understand and appreciate what it is you do day in and day out, Mister Blue. How I see it, has weight. Right. How old are you? - 35. - You've grown. - Maybe it's you? - Well, you've chosen a subject of some interest to people who appreciate art. I like to think of myself as something less than unshakable. And I value growth. My opinion can make a difference. You'll see. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Six, seven, eight. And one, two, three, four, stretch it, six, seven, eight. And one, two, three, reach, five, six, seven, eight. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, out with the knees, five, six, seven, eight. And one, two, three, push, five, six, seven, eight. Five, six, seven, eight. And one, two, bring it over. Tight stomach, tuck it under and roll up! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Breathe! Four, five. - Hi. Remember me? Two, three, four. - I met you at the gallery. And one, two, three, four, five. - You're a dancer? Seven, eight and one, two, three, four, and... How about a cup of coffee across the street? - No. - How about a drink? Will you have dinner with me? - No. - Sometime? - She's crazy about me. - You never ask about me. - What about you? - Where I'm from. What I do. - How a nice girl like you got into S&M and B&D? Okay. Where are you from? - Kansas City. Ask me! - Why do you do what do? - I don't wanna be a secretary. I did bad in school. I got a great chest. - I know. - That's the most interesting thing about me. You never said anything about the other night. You feel bad about it? - No. - How do you feel about me? I mean, when we were together, you were so hard. - This heat between us? - Yeah. - I really want it in my paintings. - But that's all I want. - You're a real shit. - What do you want from me? - Nothing. - Do you want me to be your lover, to be your man? - Fuck you. - No, I mean, let's play it out, Candy. How do you see it? We get married? Maybe we have a kid? - You loved it every minute you were inside of me. You don't give a thing! - What do you want? - Have dinner with me. - Why? - What do you mean, why? - What do you hope to gain? - Nothing. - You don't wanna make love? - Gimme a break. A burger, fries, a few laughs. - Where? - I know just the place. Can I come in? - No. - I had a nice time. I don't know what to say to you. I'd like to see you again. I don't understand women. - What's to understand, man? She didn't wanna sleep with you. - A woman of taste. - But she fucked me. - Maybe she likes to sleep alone. - That's what she said. - That's what you always say. - I always say that 'cause I don't want to get involved. She doesn't want get involved. I need romance. Love. Sex isn't that important to them. They're sensitive about these things. Emotional. Honest. She's scared of men, I gotta be patient. I'll casually wait outside the gallery every night this week. - I told you I sold a painting. Congratulations. - Keep it. He made a sale. - Fall Blue? - Cyd here? - No, she's not. She went, went to the store. She'll be back in a bit. - Shopping. - Yeah. - Well I can come back later. - Why don't you stay? Haven't seen you sober for a while. But I know better than to ask your opinion. - No, you have a gift man. And it's quite extraordinary. - No, let's just save it, all right? - Collisions. - Exactly. - Could I have a beer? - Yeah. - I'm cooking up something here, so just make yourself comfortable. I hear you got a show at Terry's. - Yeah. - Nudes? - No, fetish. Women with big tits. Garter belts, boots, panties. - That's interesting. Well, I got something going here. I can tell you that I've admired your work. It's very serious. Not all that commercial, but I think the critics were wrong the last time. I think they missed the whole point. - No they didn't, but it's nice of you to say that. I respect the critics in this town, especially Williams. - After what he said about your work? - He knows his audience. He's been right about you. - Come on, man. You hated my show. - No, I didn't. - Well, Cyd told me that you think abstractionists should be executed. I'd, I'd say I was sorry for the way things have worked out, if I really meant it. - Well, we all grow up and go our separate ways. - Well, I'm impressed with your... maturity. I thought you were more of a... - Asshole. - Yeah. Okay. I want you to know that I am.. I'm all for a friendship, with the three of us. So don't hesitate to.. To drop over, to see Cyd. - Thanks Chuck. - And if I can help you with your show or... - Thanks. - Hi Cyd. - Hi. - Give me those. - What's going on? What are you doing here? - I want you to come home. - Don't do this, Blue. - It would be different. - No it wouldn't. Don't. - You want me to leave? - Yeah, I want you to leave. - Just leave the money on the dresser. Hello. Yes? - I don't see it. - What? - What Eli sees in you. What's so special? - I'm sure |I don't know. Did you come here to tell me this? - Terry called. - Monsieur Blue est arrive. Eli says you're way behind on the show. - Did you tell Terry? - You should have told me, Mister Blue. You've only finished two more canvases. - I'll have 'em, trust me. - Never. I have something else to tell you. I have sold the next three for $24,000. A little celebration. There we are. Mister Kahn. - Mister Ray. - I just sold three paintings. - You're kidding. - Your share is 9,600. Arthur Blue, the rebel. - Blue, I gotta ask you something. Why do you paint that stuff? - You don't know? - Don't give me that intellectual horseshit about taking the history of women as object and art to the extreme. - I like high heels. - That's what I was afraid of. - I'm serious. Ever since I was a little kid, I was into it. I found this magazine in my dad's closet. It was dirty. Forbidden. - There's that art. It's fetish. - Well what's art? Those are the strongest feelings I know. Those are the most powerful images I know. That's my art. - Your art's a joke. - Who the fuck are you? Some frog outta nowhere who works in a faggot snob gallery? You can't spend five minutes with a man after screwing him. I'm sorry. - That's better. - You're a fool. Transition to “"Love Is A Battlefield" by Pat Benatar - Thanks. - You friend's a good dancer. - Why don't you dance with her? - I like to watch. Dance with her! - Are you my friend? Are you my friend? - Don't you know? - Dance with her. Racquetball, club opens at six. I don't feel good. I'm challenging Blue. You won the last game, which means I can challenge you anytime, anywhere. - I forfeit. - You can't. Forget it. Hey, are you okay to drive? Hey! Let's not do this. - Honor, Blue. What's wrong with you? - Serve. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing, serve. - Something's wrong. - I'm hot to play, serve it. - You know, this is kind of funny... - Say I beat you. - I beat you. - Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. - I've never seen you work. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? - I hit you. - Yeah. - I have something for you. It goes back to '69. - You get the other half after the show. - That can wait. You got enough to live on? - I don't want you give me everything. - Would I do that? - Money corrupts. - Thanks, Eli. - Best investment I ever made. - Don't worry. - I'm worried. - If nothing else, the gallery always attracts attention. - That's reassuring. - The bus has arrived. - You look lovely. - Don't I? What's next? - We're friends? - Another show? - The demons are gone. - Demons? - Whatever drove me to paint these, it's done. Gotta paint something else? - May I kiss you? - Heartbreaker! - Well, what do you think? - They scare me. - Well, this is serious. Good luck. - I'm very happy for you. It's good work. - I'm happy for you. - Are you? - I wish you'd waited for me. - Hi. - Come inside. - No, I can't. - Are you upset with me? Don't blame Blue if you're angry with me. - I'm not angry with you. Why would I blame him? - I didn't mean blame, I meant punish. - I don't like crowds. - He needs you. - Don't be jealous. - Those shits killed him four years ago. Now they're telling him how terrific he is, and he's laughing it up, buying new clothes. He's got a fucking tie on. - How can you deny him? - Hey, who are you? How are you holding up? - Good. - Oh, you sold them all. And I've got orders for your next show. - You're kidding. - I don't kid. Don't let him drive. Tu vas bien? - Yeah, I'm a star. - It's hard work being a star. - Your friends forget you. - He was here. - When? - He was outside. He couldn't come in. - Why? - Because of me. - I'm sorry, Blue. I got there, I saw everybody having a good time, celebrating, I just crapped out. - Stop. Oh shit. - What? - I fucked Liliane. - You what? - I fucked her. - You're some friend. - No, w-wait! Stop it! Blue, stop it. - Everything is so fucking easy for you! I hated you. And I hated myself for my petty fucking feelings. Tell me I did that in Dukes. - You think I cared about the money? Look at my suit. I hated you, 'cause you had someone who loved you, who you loved. Think I didn't want Cyd? - You met her first! - I only wanted her after you were with her. I was glad when she left you. Fuck. - We're not kids. - I know. - I am your friend. - I know.
