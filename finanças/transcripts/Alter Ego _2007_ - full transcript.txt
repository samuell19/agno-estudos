Monika Lewinsky, for example. Why is it we all know her? Bottom line? lf the penis is famous then the woman gets famous. Feel free ladies. Lets go do some shots. A couple of lines then? –No honey. –You've become such a prune! –Have you seen Fillipo? –He's on the balcony. I'm leaving. I'll be back in the morning. –Our star? –The usual. lf you guys need anything give me a call. Thanks Argiri. Your such an asshole. We were fooling around and you start breaking things? Who the hell do you think you are? Stefane, decide what it is you want. Ask Nefeli about Lewinsky. It didn't work for her. Lets go Zoe. You like the party? Philipe, leave me alone. What's going on Stef? You want to shut me out too now? –You want to talk? –Yeah, like we used to. Are you kidding? Now you want to talk! l've lost you Philipe. Are you hooked? –What? –Are you hooked? It's a simple question. Now who isn't talking? Or did you just come here to lecture me about my life? Your life is off limits. –l just wanted to catch up. –About me, not you! Did you have a good time last night? They are not waking up, don't worry. –My head is killing me Argiri. –What are you doing up there? –Tanning. –You think it's funny? –You know the house has stairs. –Tell him to stop being a startass. –Why don't you use the stairs? You guys want to bust my balls don't you? God damn it! –Coffee? –Will you tell us? No! You can die of curiosity. Assholes! Quickly everyone. Morning. In lndia kids search the trash to find things to sell… …and in Greece the headlines read who you slept with last night. The country is going to hell… …and all we care about is having a good time. –Philipe. –You going to yell at me again? –No, about last night… –Forget it, bygones. –I'm worried about you. –l worry about you too. –Good morning. –Good morning. As you've heard London's tour is temporarily canceled. What do you mean? You'll have to hold off on your shopping spree. Question. Is Thessalonika still on? That's what l wanted to talk about. The airport is on strike. –So we're not going. –We are, by bus. –Bus, what bus? All that way? –Yeah! Tell it! Let's not make a big deal out of this. Your living plush! We leave in the morning. Harry can't come so we have a new driver. –I'll drive! Have you seen Speed? –You just be on time. l want a hottie with me driving while l disarm the bomb. “Hold it steady baby”. Can l talk to you for a minute? You alright? –The videoclip? All set. –Not that, are you ok? With you? Sometimes your a bit overbearing and that lipstick! Philipe, seriously! That lipstick actually makes you look hot. Nadia l need a favor. Lay off Stefano. He's stressed you know. We're all stressed. I'm not a nanny. My job is to keep you on top. It's all about the fucking money. –What did she want? –Nothing. Just leave it. Sorry but I'm beat and not in the mood. –Want to go to Adrea's for drinks? –No, I'm just going to crash. You going alone? –I'm never alone man. –Don't do anyhting stupid. –Talk to you tomorrow. –You're leaving? –I'm expected elsewhere. –That's cool. l've got to go too. –Who is waiting for you? l thought the rule was no questions? Let's just say that you were the appetizer. I'm going to take a shower before leaving. Have a good main course. Don't forget to lock on your way out. –How you doing? –Good, you? Drink? –My usual. –Your kidding right? –Stefane where've you been? –What can l say? Live and learn. –What are you looking at? –You hear me? He's so hot! l thought he'd be taller but l'd jump him anyway. Get a grip. –Good morning. –Morning Mr Stefane. –He still sleeping? –l don't know but I'm done. Bye. Philip. Philipe! Wake up we're late! Philipe? Philipe! Philipe! –Hey! What's going on man? –You scared me. l scared you? Thank God you caught me in the loo! –You want to stay until l finish? –I'll be downstairs. Great idea! –Why don't you have a car? –l have a car. l have a car, l think. It's keys l don't have. l C AN'T TAKE lT ANY LONGER LOVE, NlKl –The keys. –Fine but a woman driver? Is that a problem? –l had keys. –Yeah, you've got it together. God! This is not what l had in mind. –There was a girl. –There's always a girl. What was that? –A girl but no keys. –l had keys but they ditched me. Now even keys are ditching you. –Have we met? –What a cliche. l know you from somewhere. Do you work for the record company? You could say that. I'm the driver. –Whose driver? –The keys? –Stop it. –Handcuffs! You? That's for pros. Philipe. Shut up! Hey, thanks. You want to talk about it? –Niki left. –Again? –And what did she do? –The bitch wouldn't unlock me. l tried to grab the key and it fell into the pool. Unbelieveable. –Do you love her? –Do l? How can we love someone who is completely wrong for us? –You sure she's wrong for you? –We fight all the time. –Who's the babe at the wheel? –l wouldn't call her a babe. –She wants things l can't give her. –Can't give her? The driver is cute huh? –l know her. –Of course you do. lf the blonde catches on we're screwed. Forget about Nefeli. Really? Fine let's go tell her then if she's no big deal. Nefeli! Your so lucky. You can't fool me. Speak. –I'm tired Philipe. –Then end it. –Easy for you to say. –It's your life. Our lives are intertwined. All this is mine too. My body and soul is this group. –That doesn't define your life. You all have the same misconceptions. You don't get that there's more to life. What if l don't like your “more”. Damn it! Want to jump? What do you say? –To get it over with? –What? We can jump. What about life? Philipe. We are all talk. It's the action that's difficult. Remember that camera girl from the videoclip? –Yeah. –Three times. –Please. –Seriously. –This going to take long? –Want to help? –What's so funny? –Nothing. l was just thinking. –Can we leave? –l think so. Your asking for it. Come on. Miss Busdriver. Miss Busdriver. Here. –Here, where is here? –At the stone wall. –l brought you food. –Thanks. Why didn't you come eat with us? Why? This is why. You have a point. We haven't been introduced. I'm Stefanos. l know. I'm Ariadni. l was told that l would one day meet an Ariadni. To get me out of the labyrinth. –l get it. Sorry, wrong Ariadni. l don't know how we got in nor how to get out. –Your in a labyrinth too? –Since l was born. There's a storm coming. –Can l ask you a question? –You just did. A second one then. How come you drive a bus? –Don't women drive buses? –Yes, but they look like men. Should l take that as a compliment? –What a babe! –She's alright. –Her name is Ariadni. –l don't care what her name is. –l'd… –Hey! Be careful about what you say. –l'd marry her. I'm being dramatic. Publicity has its upsides, from time to time. –Where are you looking? –Over there. That looks like a crocodile to you? You have to want to see it. –Show me where your looking. –Past the palm tree. –The what? –You can't see the palm tree? l olny see a big cloud. The cloud heard you. Nefeli. You seem to have everything. –Not everything. –I'm sure your missing something. l don't know if you've realized but it's raining. Your both going to get sick. We're leaving. Babe? –Good evening, welcome. –Good to be here. –It should've been ready yesterday. –What happened? Get them to hurry and deal with the luggage. I'll fill you in later. How is everyone? –What are we doing? –The lobby in an hour. l've made plans for dinner ok? –Is a half hour enough time? –We'll be fine. Don't be late. –How are you? –Fine, a bit tired. –Great job today, thanks. –You would say that. But you did. We're going for dinner, are you coming? –I'm not hungry. I'm going to stay in. –Alone? You sure? –Yes. Thanks though. –No, thank you. Eat something, ok. –Come here. –I'm fine where l am. l want to remind you of the past. –A friend of yours? –Philipe, you don't remember me? –She knows me. –It's me, Katerina. Katerina, l didn't recognize you with your underwear… –Wasn't she your first? –Shut up or your dead! Do you want all three of us to be together? –Run man. Run! –What? –What happened to you? –l froze completely! Where did she find us? l froze l tell you. No it's where she found you, not us. She's all yours. l don't know why this is happenning. l just called… …to hear your voice but your not there, so bye. –What's up Adrea? –Forget it Stefane. That good huh? l don't know if you've noticed but we're all one big happy family. –Tell me you want me. –l want you. –Tell me you really want me. –l really want you. –Say, l want you so much. –Yes, l want you so much. Me too. Say… Let's be mute. –I'm so hungry. –I'm not. –We drinking wine? –No, saki. –Right. –Saki for everone. Where are you? I'm on my way. I'm leaving, see you all tomorrow. –Be careful. –Don't worry, they'll be careful. Desert? I'm going to kill you. It was so simple back then. We ran races all day. Whoever got… …to the finish line first won. –l used to beat you all the time. –You wish, not even once. Are you nuts or did you have a memory lapse? Up to the umbrellas. No way! For once! Third grade, Lilly Oikonomopoulou… …fourth desk from our left. The blonde with the green eyes. –She was so cute. –l liked her friend Artemis. –l wonder where they are now. –You think they're in Thessaloniki? –Will you let me help you? –What? To get up? I'm here, talk to me. I'm fine. Why do you keep making it such a big deal? Because l care about you. Now your going to tell me l have beautiful eyes and kiss me? No, I'm going to give you the spanking your mom never did. –With you everything is a joke. –That's what keeps us alive. Let me also remind you that my mom spanked us both, a lot. Your right. –Stef… –What? –I'm going to leave. –Where are you going to go? l don't know. Where do you go after here? What do you mean? l can't take it anymore. I'm tired Stef. I'm bored. –What about our dream? We did that. What's left? You have a lot to offer the band. –And you don't? Me? I'm going to leave. Don't do anything stupid. l've got to piss, goodnight. –You drinking? –You drunk? –Your very pretty. –What are you doing? –I'm fine and you? –l meant what are you up to? I'm not pretty. –Your beautiful. –You want to know what l think? –Do l have a choice? Fine. Tell me. Your annoyed in general. Then you see Nefeli with a cute guy. –He wasn't cute. –Let me finish. Sorry. So she's with a guy and your mad. You see me and think, why not. –Your… –l am. l believe this belongs to you. You were a bit trashed. Good night Stefane. –How are you? Good? –Are you crazy? –Alone? I'll keep you company. –What am l? A filly? Your my friend! Now close the door I'm freezzing. –What happened? –The chick wanted it African style. –How do you do it? –Is it my fault I'm so charming?

You didn't see a guy outside with a shotgun, did you? –You look a mess. –Thanks. –What? –Nothing. Tell me. –You seem determined. –l am. Remember the tree story? –The tree huh? –So you remember. Your the crazy one. I'm just following your lead. That's because your crazy too man. Hey man, it's just one night. Ready? –One night… –Filled with fame and glory… …and money. –What'd you think of the concert? –l've seen worse. –What? –Forget it. Nice show. Wake up man, we're here. Philipe. Philipe. Philipe. Philipe! Thank you. Can you do me a favor? Whatever you want. l don't want him to feel any pain. Stef wake up! What are you doing? You were in a coma. –A coma huh? Great! Let me stretch a bit. What a beautiful light. A great day for a bikeride. The sun, the open road. Just us and our thoughts. Are you crazy? What are you doing? Don't you know? What l take is so l don't feel any pain. I'm tired of being in pain. –I'll get the doctor. –Your not listening. –Why didn't you tell me? –So that l don't end up here. You couldn't do anything. –I'll get the doctor. –Relax. This is our last ride. Enjoy it. –What? –Ariadni. –She's with the others, I'll get her. –Your not listening… …Ariadni. –Your freaking me out. I'll get the doctor. –What about Nefeli? lf you love each other why do you treat each other like crap? Forget your excuses about being confused. Do something. lf she can't do it then you must. Bitch her out, dump her, love her. Do whatever you want but deal with it. l know it's hard but it's the truth. What about Stefano? You've completely fucked him. Was that your dream? Fame, money and women? l played and lost man. For me the game is over. You have one life left. Use it wisely. Wake up. Wake up. Today waS held the memorial Service of one member… …of the Alter Ego group and only cloSe relativeS and friendS attended. Stefane? Stefane? Leave it. Why are you sitting in the dark? l kept calling but you wouldn't pick up. l got worried. Stefane do you hear me? –l hear you. Have you eaten anything? Do you want me to order you take-out? l want to be alone. Please talk to me. It's me. Stefane. –Maybe we should talk… –l want to be alone. Please. I'm going to call you tomorrow. l miss him too. Dude, your house is a mess. –What do you want? –He speaks. l came to watch t. v. What are we watching? Oh, the usual. You need to snap out of it. Go out, do something. Fuck whatever walks and talks like you? Yeah! Jerk off, go to the kiosk to buy gum. Do the kiosk girl too. Just do something Stef. Come on, get dressed. Leave me alone. Either get dressed or I'm going to dress you. You think Philipo would've liked this? Leave him out of this! –Why? You going to tell me what l can or can't say? Philipo would've wanted you to be out there living. Since he can't. l don't want to! l want peace and quiet. Is that why you didn't let Adrea in yesterday? That's not peace and quiet. It seems more like depression to me. Come on man, let's go get a drink. –Drop it Timo. –It's up to you. We miss you man. l brought you company. –Not the guitar. –Bruto, come here. He's trained right? Want to go out? Come on we don't bite. –Bruto? –Don't let his size fool you… …he's viscous. –Can l ask you something? –Anything. –What are we doing here so early? –You don't like it? Your strange. Actually your different. That's a good thing. –l used to come here with my dad. –Was he a fisherman? No he had a much more boring job. He was a busdriver. He just liked the feel of it. Why did you come find me? Sometimes we all need help even if we don't know it. I'm going to take a quick shower. You clean the fish. Do what? It's Nefeli. Are you going to pick up? –Where is Ariadni? –She'll be back soon. What are you doing here? Forget it I'm just happy to meet you. l can't believe your in our living room. You want some coffee… …or do you not drink coffee? Tea? Your so good-looking in person. Are you hungry? l was just going out. I'll bring you the best cheesepie! The best for the best. Don't leave. I'll be right back. It was so good chatting with you. l can't believe your in our living room. –Good morning. –Good morning. –Everything ok? –Yeah. What? Oh my God, you met Roula. Did she do anything to you? l shouldn't have left you with her. –It's ok. So you do know her. Who Roula? She's my best friend. You sure she didn't do anything. –Positive. What? –Nothing, let's go. –Where? –You'll see. –Tonight I'm taking you out. –Where? All I'm going to tell you is to get dressed up. This is the place? Clean air, good food. Who can ask for anything more. Want to go in? –What do you think? –That my butt is frozen. But it's worth it for this gyros. –Cheers. –Cheers. What? l want ice cream. You want ice cream. l didn't know we were going to steal it. Your wish is my command, my princess. You broke it? It's such a shame for the kiosk owner. Didn't you say you wanted ice cream? All this for a stick? At least take something larger. This is what l want. This is the best ice cream l've ever had. Were you a burglar before you became a famous singer? Let's just say that some of my friends no longer walk the streets. Seriously. –l see. Let me see you. You got dirty. Here comes a new labyrinth. Good morning. That's nice. What is it? Nothing. –I'll see you at home. –Ok. –How'd you get in? –With my key. Right. You still have it. How are you? How do you think l am? What we've feared for years happened. We split up. The band, us. We've split up. –Life goes on. Yeah. That's what they tell me. What about us? Are we still together? Nefeli. Why are you doing this? Look at me. You still want this? We've said and done it all. All. Now all we do is hurt one another. l don't want it anymore, l can't. Your one of the most important people in my life. l want you to be part of my life. l want you to be well. l want you to be well. l miss the band. l miss Philipo… …you… l miss the confidence l felt a couple of years ago. I'm scared. I'm scared too. So this is it? It's over? No. It's the beginning. I'm going to miss you. Sorry. l thought you were alone. Ariadni! Ariadni. –Don't touch me! –Listen to me. l said, don't touch me! –Your making a mistake. Listen. –l don't want to hear it. –What you saw was nothing. –Please leave. –Listen to me. –Leave God damn it! Your making a mistake. Listen to me. Your making a mistake. Ariadni. Ariadni. –Ariadni. –Leave. Roula. Is she in there? Roula, hun. Let me in. He called me hun. Just for a second. l just want to see her to explain. She never wants to see you again. Go home. I'll keep coming until l see her. Until she hears me out. So that you'll always have ice cream. –Stefane… –Don't say anything… …let me explain. With Nefeli nothing… Happened. l know. l saw something and l got the wrong idea. –How do you know? –It doesn't matter. It's beautiful. –l missed you so much. –l can't. We are just a dream, a wish. Thank you for that. l love you. –What did you say? –l love you. It's right in front of you. The guy that wants you so much is right here. Make the move and take it. –l can't. It's beyond my control. l don't have the strength. Take care. –l see your still alive. –Theoretically. At least you still have your sense of humor. –Thanks for coming. –Please. What do you plan on doing? The band and music is all l had. The only thing l know how to do. –Then do it, but your way. –I'm not ready to sing. Fine then write. –It's not easy. –At least try. Sometimes pain is a source of creativity. You know that. You want some coffe? –Yeah but I'll make it. –Why? You might know music but you can't make coffee on your life. What's wrong hun? –I'm thinking. –Of what? Everything he did. Why are you torturing yourself? Nothing happened between them. He ran like crazy to explain. He's crazy about you. Even Nefeli told you nothing happened. What else do you want? Can l finish? And most importantly he told you he loves you. What else do you want him to do? l get that your scared. What l don't get is why you stare into nothingness all lovestruck. PHILIPOS How are you? What I'm asking… I miss you man. Have you turned heaven into hell yet? I'm a meSS. barely living. Strange huh? They Say pain hides great Strength but i'm afraid. I've lost her. You were right you know. You need to control life not let it control you. I miss you Philipe. l love you. I'm not ready to sing. –Fine then write. –It's not easy. Will you tell us why your playing spida, spisa, spiderman? What is it, rush hour around here? Ariadni your making a mistake. Listen to me. Listen to me. Your making a mistake. Ariadni, please. Your making a mistake. Listen to me. Were you a burglar before you became a famous singer? Sakis!… You can say yes!…
