Yay! Go ahead, baby. Blow them out. Make a good wish. Honey? Honey? Corinne. Corinne, baby. Are you... hey, hey, hey. Are you okay? - Liam! - Honey. - Oh, my God. - Baby. - Are you okay? - Hey, baby. Honey? Honey? Beverly, call 911. - Is she breathing? - Corinne. Are you choking? - Are you okay? Hey, hey. Hey. - Take a My friend's daughter can't breathe. There's my brave girl. Did you bring my iPad? Oh, even better. A special visitor. Professor Wiggles! He has been worried sick about you at home and I told him no bears in the hospital, but I snuck him in. You do know that I'm 11, right? Oh, no. He's with me. I'm gonna take him home. It's okay. He can stay. And how's our little patient today? I'd be better if I could go home. Well, in that case, we should take a look, huh? Breathe in through your nose for me. Hold it. Hold it. Almost there. And exhale. Don't worry, it's perfectly normal. In fact, I bet you and your friend there are gonna be home in no time. Knock, knock! Hello, sweetheart. Grandma! How are you feeling? Better. Could I see you both in the hallway? Of course. Two minutes. Daddy and Grammy are gonna go talk to the doctor, okay? We'll be right back. Keep an eye on this guy. The lungs are full of tiny branching airways known as bronchi. Oxygen travels through these airways, ending up in tiny sacs called alveoli. Oh, whoa. I am sorry. I didn't get half of that. Basically, the cystic fibrosis is causing Corinne's mucus to clog the passages that carry air in and out of the lungs. But the good news is that she's showing tremendous signs of improvement. And assuming there's no significant setbacks, I don't find a reason why we couldn't discharge in the next day or so. But? But the damage caused by the infection is irreversible. - Irreversible? - Uh, so what are you saying? That my granddaughter will never live a normal life? Not necessarily. I suggest social interaction should be kept at a minimum. At least until her immune system improves. Hmm. She's not gonna like that much. Nope. I also recommend in-home nursing care for the next three months. In-home? Do you really think that's necessary? I can send Corinne's file to the nursing agency and they will take care of all the necessary arrangements. Okay. Don't worry. I promise, your daughter will be in very good hands. Okay. Thank you, Dr. Caldwell. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Excuse me. I would like to chip in to cover the costs. No, that's not necessary, Miriam. Well, either way, I still plan on staying involved. I'm sure you do. Can we stop by the cemetery? Um, sweetheart, I'm so sorry, but the doctor said we really need to limit any activity until your immune system is better, okay? Yeah. But we will soon. Promise. There, sweetie. Let me get your oxygen. All right, there we go. There you are. Thanks. Let me get that. I got it. You sure? Pretty cool, huh? Aww. And tonight, I'm gonna order your favorite, we'll have ham and pineapple pizza. Not exactly the healthiest choice. Yeah, I think we can let this slide this time. Okay. But first, you heard the doctor, you need to get all the rest you can get. Dad. I know. I know. Come on. Let's head up to bed. But I just got out of bed. Yeah, but now, you get to be in your own bed in your own home. Come on. You're not too old for a piggyback ride, are you? - No. - All right. Come on. - Hop on. - Yay. All right. Let's get you under the covers. - I'm not tired. - I know. Dr. Caldwell said you need all the rest you can get. Say goodbye to your grandmother. Bye, Grandma. Bye, sweetheart. I'll see you downstairs. Are you and grandma gonna go argue downstairs so I can't hear you? What? Look, your grandma and I, we both want what's best for you, okay? And sometimes, that means that there's things that we need to discuss. Okay. Okay. There's gonna be a lot of changes going on around here, for all of us. But it's gonna work best if we all work together as a team. Think you're up for that? I think so. Good. 'Cause you're the toughest kid I've ever met. And I need somebody to show me how it's done. Let's get you some rest for now, though. Be nice to her. No promises. Some good candidates here. Well, yeah. There's a lot we need to consider before we think about just bringing a total stranger into the house. Would you please think about Corinne? It's exactly what I am thinking about. Liam, she now has needs that, frankly, you and I are not equipped to provide. And I know how stressed things have been at work. Yeah, but that's all temporary. I mean, it's gonna get better once this deal goes through. Oh, please. And then, there'll just be another and then another. Okay. I get it. Amy might not be here, but I am. Please don't shut me out. I won't. Promise. Okay. You'll see, once you get settled and find a nurse, everything will be so much better. I wish you could come home, Mommy. You could make breakfast and we could watch movies, and... I just miss you so much. Hey, kiddo. Honey, look out! Look out! Do you think she'll be there to greet me in heaven? Oh. Hey. I know things got a little scary there, okay? But you're not gonna see her in heaven for a long, long time 'cause you're gonna be stuck here with me, okay? You're gonna be just fine. I promise. Oh, hey, let's get this back on you, okay? I know it's uncomfortable but it's what's gonna help you right now. So tell me about your qualifications. Well, I spent two years at Hollywood Pres and before that, I was at Northridge for three years. As you can understand, it's a in-home situation and, you know, with my daughter's health and everything, we just wanna make sure we're getting the care that she needs. Actually, I have quite a bit of experience with bronchiectasis. Uh, it says here you got your CNA from Harvard. Harvard School. Um, I'm sorry? Oh, it's online. And it takes, like, half the time. Ah. I brought a, uh, a diagram explaining my treatment regimen. I'd love to see it. I just, uh, need to find it. Uh. I, uh, I think I left it in my other bag. Hi. Uh, you must be Mr. Martin. I'm Victoria Jones. Uh, Well Spring sent me. Oh. Wonderful. Yeah. Here, come on in. - Oh, thanks. - Uh-hmm. Hey, sweetie. Do you actually wanna come join us? Come on. Yeah, right this way. He was sick and then so, you know, I kind of stepped into that role at a young age, and I was like, "I think that this is something I'm really good at." And I sensed... you know, I could help him. - That's amazing. - Yeah. Well, I just finished a posting with a family over on the Westside. It was a long recovery, but he's doing much better now. Corinne, I'd like you to meet Ms. Victoria. Oh, hello. It's so nice to meet you. You, too. Oh. Honey, are you all right? Your breathing sounds a little bit restricted. Uh, do you mind? - Not at all. - Have a seat for me. - Oh. Okay. - I'm gonna ask you to take a deep breath, okay? All right. Deep breath in. Yeah? Deeper. I, uh, find this helps loosen the mucus in the lungs. Uh-hmm. How is that? A little better? Uh-hmm. Here. Have a seat. Oh, you studied at Duke? - Yeah. That's right. - That's great. I heard they have an amazing nursing program. I did my undergrad at Chapel Hill. Oh. Small world. Uh, yeah, it was, uh, not easy, but it... but it opened a lot of opportunities for me. So why the shift to private nursing? Um, honestly, I guess I found it really challenging to give my patients the one-on-one care I thought they deserved. That's really altruistic of you. What's altruist... Altruistic. Basically means that she likes to do nice things for other people, which is a good quality to have if you're a nurse. Sorry. I'm so sorry to cut this short, but it seems like work is blowing up. Hence the reason I need help. No problem. Um, thank you. Um, thank you. Um, do you... do you mind if I use the restroom before I go? Uh, not at all. It's just around the corner. - All right. Thanks. - Uh-hmm. Bye. I really like her. She's definitely at the top of the list. You should hire her. I should, should I? She's young, she's pretty, and she's not scary like the other ones. - Uh-hmm. - And she's altru... Altruistic. She could help you. Now you sound like your grandmother. She is right sometimes, you know? We lost Amy about a year ago. It's hard to believe it's been that long actually. Uh-hmm. Yeah, that's why all this with Corinne has been a little bit... well, anyway. She's a strong little girl. She's gonna be okay. She got that from her mama. Well, I see a lot of that spirit in you, too. Well, I've taken up enough of time your time. I'm sure you have other people to meet with. I'm really glad you came by. Thank you. And let me show you the door. Uh-hmm. Thank you. Well, whatever you two decide, it was really nice meeting you. You as well. And if you need any additional references or background information, you can just contact me directly. - Any time. - Sounds good. - Thank you so much. - Yeah. Well? Well what? When can she start? Easy now. One step at a time, sweetie. - But I like her. - I know. I know. I just don't wanna rush into anything. Fine. Hi. Is this Eleanor? Speaking. Hi. My name is Liam Martin. I was referred to you by Victoria Jones? Ah, yes. Victoria. How can I help you? Uh, yeah, well, as it turns out, my daughter and I are in need of a home nurse and I was wondering if I can maybe just... Uh, of course, well, Well Spring certainly outdid themselves. Victoria was fantastic. - Really? - A real godsend. I couldn't have gotten through without her. Huh. Do you mind me asking what the nature of your illness was? COPD. Um, well, Eleanor, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Anytime. Have a good evening. Well? Apparently she's, like, total nightmare. Really? Yeah, super mean, like hates kids too. Anyone ever tell you, you have a terrible poker face? Wait, you're 11. What do you know about poker? I have an app on my iPad. Of course you do. Also, remind me to check that parental controls on your iPad. Who do you think installed them? Good point. Well, this is you. This used to be our guest bedroom but we have not had a lot of guests since Amy, but anyway, it's yours, so make it your own. And you really don't have to win me over. - It's perfect. - Oh, it's no trouble. If you need anything though, just let me know, okay? - Yeah. Thanks. - Okay. Hey, Liam, hold on a sec. I'm so sorry I have to run so soon. We're actually in the middle of this important acquisition at the office. Oh, that's why I'm here, isn't it, to help? Oh, thank you. Look, I know this is a big change. No one expects you to adjust in just a day. Well, thank you. - Good? - Yes. Okay. You have my number, right? - Yes, go. - Okay. Are you ever coming back? Probably not for a while. I have to take my classes on the computer. That doesn't sound so bad. Easy for you to say, you get to see your friends. Kendall, time to go! Coming! Maybe I can come visit? You're not in, like, a bubble, right? The doctor said I have to stay six feet away from people until my lungs are better. Kendall! Gotta go. Talk to you soon! Bye! You miss your friends. You know, when I was about your age, I got really sick too. - Really? - Yeah. I couldn't go to school. I couldn't see my friends or Bobby Hutchinson. What did you do? Well, I wrote them letters, every day. And, you know, after a while, it's like they weren't even gone at all. And Bobby? Fell in love with a fifth grader. Well, guess, it wasn't meant to be. But, you know, that's when I decided I wanted to be a nurse. So I could help other little girls like you. Maybe I should be a nurse too! Yeah, maybe. But first, we got to get you better. You know what? I have just the thing. I don't like tea. Well, this isn't just any tea. This is special tea. My mom used to make that for me when I wasn't feeling well. And now I'm making it for you. What's in it? Family secret. But my mom did use to say that it cures the heart and the soul. - Not bad. - Uh-hmm. Told you. That's my mom. She was in an accident. I lost people who are close to me too. Did you ever get over it? Well, if you think about it, would you ever really want to? I mean, no matter what happens, they're always gonna be right here. Okay, I know you're gonna hate me but we have to do physical therapy. - Okay. - Aw. - Thank you. - Uh-hmm. Okay. Don't hesitate to give me a call anytime, Bernard, if you have any trouble, okay? - All right. - Okay? - Thank you. - Thank you. I know it wasn't easy leaving Corinne so soon, but once we close this deal... If we close this deal. You won't have to worry anymore. Well, we won't have to worry anymore. Come here. So, how are things going with the new nurse, anyway? Uh, well, apparently, and I quote, "Victoria has already built the most amazing island on Animal Crossing." She's a tough one. Like her mom. Like her dad. The representative for the Keller account is on the line. Tell him Liam will call him back. - Tell him... - Please? Take a moment for yourself. Tell him I'll be right there. - Uh-hmm. - Thanks, Phil. Okay. You should come by sometime. - Corinne would love to see you. - Don't worry. This little setback won't stop me from hanging with my favorite crew. I don't know why I'm so tired. Hmm, maybe we overdid a little on the physical therapy. I almost forgot. I brought you something. I figured it being our first day and all, you deserved a little something special. I love him! Thank you! He's been in the family a long time. I know you'll give him a good home. And a name. How about Snowflake? Hmm, perfect. Now, how about you and Snowflake take a little nap? Okay. Sleep tight. Hello? Anybody home? Hello? What the hell do you think you're doing? Who are you? How-how did you get in here? I'm Miriam. I'm Corinne's grandmother. Oh, you must be the new nurse. Victoria. I'll ask you again. What are you doing with my daughter's clothes? Liam said I was welcome to look around if I needed anything. I am quite certain this is not what he meant. I apologize. You know, I don't suppose Liam mentioned how hesitant he was to bring in someone to help with Corinne. He didn't. Hmm, well, it took some convincing. So please do not prove me wrong. I promise you have nothing to be concerned about. Good. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to go see my granddaughter. Of course. There was a time when this little girl could spend all afternoon running up and down the soccer field and still stay up late at night. She took after her mama. My Amy played varsity all four years of high school. She misses her terribly. Did she say that? She didn't have to. Well... I suppose Amy's in a better place now, smiling down on us all. Indeed. Liam, on the other hand, if he knew that I'd paid a visit... What visit? Hmm. Well, perhaps bringing you on isn't a mistake after all. Miriam, you are always welcome here. Thank you. What's going on? What are you doing up? Something smelled good and I didn't wanna miss out. Hmm. Well, since you're here, you might as well have a seat. Wow. I can't remember the last time we had a home-cooked breakfast. Breakfast was always mom's thing. Well, I'm sure she would still want you to eat it. How about we have a picture to commemorate our first breakfast? That's a great idea, but you get in here too. Oh, okay. Here. Let me take it. Ready? Cheese! Oh, shoot. Um, I lost track of time. I'm late for work. This looks amazing. I'm so sorry. Um, I love you. Have a great day. - Bye, babe. - Okay. Bye, dad. Lunch. You know, I just figured it was one less thing for you to worry about. For me? Wow. Thank you. Uh-hmm. Bye, guys. I will join you. Hmm, would you like pancakes first? How you feeling? Can't we do this outside? It's getting cold out. Being sick sucks. Tell you what, when your dad gets home, we'll do something fun. He usually gets home too late. Hmm, he works a lot, huh? Ever since mom died. Well, he can't work all the time, right? I mean, he must have friends or... dates? The only person he ever hangs out with is Beverly from work. Are they close? I guess. She knew my mom and dad ever since they were in college. I see. Well, we'll just have to do something then, hmm? Just the two of us. We're gonna make it a girls night. Sounds like somebody could use a cup of my special tea. - Yes, please. - Uh-hmm. Say no more. Oh, Liam, I'm so happy you're home. I... oh, I didn't realize you had company. Victoria, this is... Beverly. Corinne has told me so much about you. It's really nice to meet you. Likewise. And Liam has been raving about the work you've been doing. - Raving, huh? - Yeah. You know, you look familiar. Have we met? I don't think so. I could swear I've seen you before. You know, I'm really good with faces and I definitely don't think we've met. I'm sorry. I must have confused you with someone else. Yeah. Guess so. So how is she? She's sleeping. - Already? - Yeah. We were watching a movie and she just conked out. Wow. - I promise I'll keep it quick. - Yeah. Oh, you're always welcome to stop by and see our girl. Hey, baby. What are you doing up? Corinne! Corinne! Hey! Give me some room! Give me some room! Here. Here. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Come on, Corinne. Shh. You're okay. Calm down. Calm down. There you go. Breathe. Come on, Corinne. Breathe. Shh. There you go. Breathe. You're okay. Yeah. - Can I hold her? - Yeah, of course. Oh, come here, sweetie. Okay. Okay. Oh, baby. Daddy's here. I'm not going anywhere, okay? Guess who came see you. Hi, sweetie. Deep breaths. Daddy's here. I'm not going anywhere. I thought she was supposed to be recovering, you know? Well, the important thing is that she's okay now. Yeah, but what would happen if Victoria hadn't been there? Luckily, she was. Ever since Amy's been gone, I'm just doing the best I can, but I feel like sometimes I'm just drowning, just barely trying to stay afloat. You don't have to do this alone, Liam. You have me. You have Miriam. How is she? Better. She requested some tea. Well, let's get her some tea. Since when does Corinne drink tea? Ever since Victoria started making her this special family recipe she's got. Corinne can't get enough of it actually. Would you like a cup? Maybe next time. You're not leaving, right? You've got enough going on. I can come back and see Corinne another time. No, no, no. Bev, you have to come upstairs. She hasn't seen you in so long. She's dying to see you. I know she is. - Oh. - Victoria? - I'm sorry. - Oh, my gosh. Oh, it's okay. - We gotta get this cleaned up. - No. I... I'm fine. It's okay. I'll finish up here. - No. Really, you don't have to. - I insist. Come on. Here. Right this way. I've got hydrogen peroxide. Just rinse it off. Okay. - No, it's... - Too much? It's just a scratch. It's... Good, 'cause I don't think I can... - Ow! afford a nurse for my nurse. Ow! Okay. You know what? Let's just leave the medicine to the professionals. That's probably a good idea. All right. Hey, thank you for tonight. Yeah. I was just doing my job. No. It was... Liam, you're a really good father... and a really good man. Thank you. Maybe not a great doctor. Fair enough. Okay. Let's see how good this is. The water was finished so I poured it. Thanks. Do you wanna take it up with me? You know what? I really should get going. Like I said, I'll come back another time. You sure? Yeah. It's fine. See you at work tomorrow. Okay. It was nice meeting you, Victoria. Yeah. You too. Well, better not keep her waiting. Yeah. I'll bring this up. Sure. Ooh, looks delicious. Yeah. So great. Oh, garlic. There is nothing more delicious to me than garlic. Just simmering in butter. Then one more. We're setting it aside. Can I have some cereal? Yeah. Yeah. I'll bring it right up. Morning. Good morning. How's the hand? - Oh, it's a lot better. - Can I see? Oh, that's looking great. Um, I had an idea. I would like to do something nice for you. I was thinking dinner tonight. Uh, sure. Yeah. What do you want me to make? No. I would like to make you dinner. Oh. Oh, okay. The whole family or... Or just two of us. Yeah. I'd like that. Great. All right. I'm gonna get dressed for work but I'll see you tonight. Okay. Cool. - Have a good day. - Thanks. You too. Hey. You feeling okay? I didn't sleep well last night. Hmm. Hope you're not coming down with anything. Yeah. Me too. I'd hate to see what you do without me. That makes two of us. How's Corinne? She's doing much better, thanks. I went ahead and called Dr. Caldwell just to be safe. And Victoria? Said she was fine. Didn't wanna get it looked at. - That's good. - Yeah. I actually, uh, asked her to dinner tonight. - Oh. - That's okay, right? Are you asking for permission? No. I guess I just wanna make sure it wasn't like a totally crazy idea. You know, just because Amy and I were friends doesn't mean I don't wanna see you happy. Thanks. It means a lot. Anytime. Hey, Dr. Caldwell. It's Liam Martin. Hi. I got your message about last night. How is she doing today? She's actually doing much better. Like nothing ever happened. Well, I'd still feel much better if you could bring her in. How about Thursday morning at 10:00? Uh, that should be great. Oh, and, uh, Doc, you were right about Victoria. She's been wonderful. Victoria? The nurse. You know, the one from the agency you recommended. Right. I just... I thought I knew everyone over there. Well, she did say she was new, so... Uh-hmm. Well, I look forward to hearing about it all on Thursday. Sounds good. See you then. ♪ I used to dream about it every day ♪ ♪ Hoping that I feel that way again ♪ ♪ I still think about it to this day ♪ ♪ Hoping that I love that way again ♪ ♪ And you're still on my mind right now ♪ ♪ I love you till the sun goes down ♪ ♪ And, no I wouldn't change a thing ♪ ♪ That feeling goes all around ♪ Yeah ♪ That feeling still goes all around ♪ Don't you think maybe you've had enough computer time for tonight? I can't go outside. I can't see my friends. Computer time is all I've got. Honey, you really need to rest, especially after last night. Kendall, I gotta go. - Talk soon. - Talk soon. What do you think? You look pretty. Well, I figured since your dad is going through all the trouble of making dinner, I should try and look nice. He's not the best cook. Well, that's probably a good thing 'cause I can't eat very much in this dress. My mom used to wear dresses like that. Really? Hmm. Oh. I'm gonna go say hi to your dad. How about I sent him up with a cup of tea? - Sure. - Yeah. ♪ Yeah ♪ I hope that when you need someone ♪ ♪ That they come when you call Wow. I overdressed. No. You look stunning. Thank you. - Something wrong? - No. Sorry. Uh, Amy used to wear that same perfume. Ah, she had good taste. What's this? Oh. I got you something. You didn't have to do that. I figured since you're trying to manage your time. Look at that. Almost like a family. Almost. That's really thoughtful. - Thank you. - Uh-hmm. All right. Well, I should get started on dinner. Yes. Oh, I promised our girl I would make her some tea. Of course. This is really nice. Thank you. You've been doing so much for us, I just wanted to do something for you. Well, I'm a nurse. It's my job. But it's really nice to get to know you. I'm so awkward with this. I'm so sorry. It's been... I've just been managing so much for so long, I realized I've had like no time for social life. Is that what it's called? Even with Beverly, you know, all we have time for is work, really. Can I ask you something? Sure. The other night when I was in the shower... Oh. I'm so sorry about that. I should have... Did you like what you saw? It's been a minute since I've done this. Yeah, we're just... We're just talking. It's not that. I really think you're amazing. I just wanna be careful we don't... we don't rush anything. And make this more complicated than it already is. We don't have to rush anything. I mean, you're not gonna be Corinne's nurse forever. And you're afraid of getting attached? 'Cause I have this uncanny way of sticking around. I mean, I didn't, you know, make it through all those semesters in Emory without perseverance. Emory? I thought you went to Duke? Um, my undergrad was at Emory. Oh. Miriam? Miriam! - Really? - What do you... - I... - My granddaughter texted me... - Miriam! to stop by. Miriam, what do you... - Wait, no. Go ahead. - I'll - Grandma? - Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry I woke you. Miriam, let's talk about this. Hardly think this is the appropriate time to have this conversation, wouldn't you agree? I'll be downstairs. - Night, sweetie. - Good night. I'm sorry you and daddy are fighting. Oh, no, no, no, sweetheart, we're not fighting. We just had a little disagreement. That's all. It'll be handled very, very soon. Promise. I love you, baby. Sweet dreams, okay? Hey, everything okay? Yeah. No. Sometimes I cannot stand that woman. Maybe you could use another glass of wine. No, I... actually, I think we should just call it a night. - Really? - Yeah. I wanted tonight to be special. - Yeah? And now, it's... - Yeah, I understand. Sorry. Hey, look, I'll, uh, go clean everything up. - Don't worry about it, okay? - Are you sure? - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. Hey. Um, look... about last night, I just... Don't even worry about it. It's okay. Um, there's something you should see. Okay. You found this with her things? When her bag fell over. This couldn't have come from anywhere else. I don't know where. Are you okay? I... I'm coming. Hold on. A custody lawyer? What? Victoria found this in your purse when she was cleaning up last night. Don't even try to play games with me, Miriam. I have never seen that before. What are you talking about? So what are you saying, she's lying? No. I'm just saying it isn't mine. What possible reason would Victoria have to make this up? Or it's you, on the other hand, have been contentious with me ever since Amy... Ever since when, Liam? Go on. Say it. I just... I never thought you would stoop this low. How can you even imply such a thing? Because you imply it every time you open your mouth with me, Miriam. I never add up for you, do I? I get it. I'm not home enough. I work too much. How I take care of the house? But ask yourself, what would Amy have to say about that? No. No! Don't you dare tell me what my daughter would or would not have said. Especially not when you were carrying on in front of her child with her! "Carrying on"? What does that even supposed to mean? Oh, you might let her wear her clothes and you might let her take care of her child, and hell, you might even let her sleep with her husband. It was one dinner, Miriam! Listen to me! You will never, ever replace my Amy. Do you understand me? I will not allow it. So you'll just gonna try and take my kid from me, huh? I will not even respond to that ridiculous accusation. You're not welcome in my home anymore. What? Liam. Goodbye. Liam, let's just calm down! Liam! Oh. Uh-oh. I know that look. How are you doing? Now, you're just deflecting. Sorry. It's, um... it's been a morning. I'll be fine, though. You know, for a salesman, you're a terrible liar. It, um... honestly feels like everything is just... unraveling right now. Corinne's not only sick, now she's, like, despondent practically. And then this whole thing with Miriam is like just... it's just a lot. Are you absolutely certain it was hers? Well, I mean, you were the only other one at the house. So, unless there's something you wanna tell me. There is one other person though, isn't there? - Victoria? - Yeah. I don't know, Liam. I just don't know. I just... I don't see Miriam going that far. Can she be a handful? Absolutely. Opinionated? Beyond belief. But she has never been underhanded. Hmm. Great news. Your blood pressure, cholesterol, it's all normal. Then why do I feel so rundown? I'm not sure. But I am curious about one thing. Why are you taking doxadone? I'm not. Okay. It's in your system. How unlucky if I can't remember to take my vitamins. Hmm. Um, doctor, out of curiosity, what would happen if you administered that drug to a patient with a respiratory condition? I wouldn't recommend it. It can cause massive flare ups, illness, or worse. Why? - I'm home. - Hey, there. How was your day? It's fine. You must be starving. Come. Victoria made spaghetti and meatballs! Have a seat. Tell us about your day. It was interesting. I went to see that, um, client that we spoke about this morning. - Oh. - We talked about that deal she's negotiating. She said she didn't know anything about it. It's probably just a tactic. She seemed pretty sincere. Oh, you're tensed. I just remember that I need to take care of something before I eat. Oh, it's gonna get cold. It'll only take a second. Well Springs Home Nursing Care Agency, how can I help you? Hi. This is Liam Martin. I have one of your nurses employed in my home. Yes. What can I do for you? Uh, I was curious. Do you do background checks on your nurses? We do. I don't suppose it'd be possible to get a copy of one of them, would it? Uh, sir, if you're having any issues with any of our staff, you do know that anything we discuss is strictly confidential. No. No, no, no. Uh, Victoria is very committed. I just, um, want to get a complete picture. I understand and I will submit your request for approval. Thank you. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any other questions. I won't. Thank you. Coming. Is everybody awake? We gotta leave in like 15! - You all right? - Uh-hmm. Hmm. Hey. - Everything okay? - Yeah. We had a bit of a coughing spell, but everything's all right now, right, sweetheart? Huh. All right. Well, we'll see what the doctor has to say about that. I'm gonna take a shower and we gotta go. Come on. Let's get you dressed. I'm happy to go with you. Just going to the doctor, Victoria. Uh, I really don't mind. Victoria. All right. You know, just take Snowflake, um, and buckle your seatbelt, please. Ready, sweetie? I'm not gonna have to get a shot, am I? I don't know. Come on. I'm a little concerned that she's been having such a severe relapses. Her lungs should be further along. Is she getting plenty of rest? Yeah. That's, uh, practically all she does these days. - Hmm. - And Victoria has been doing some physical therapy with her and she's got her doing other little activities to keep her occupied. But most days, we can hardly get her out of bed. I know Miriam has been concerned. You spoke to Miriam? Hmm, once or twice. She just had a few questions about your daughter's condition. I think I'd like to run some blood work. See if we can't figure out why you're not getting better. Does that mean I'm gonna need a shot? What if I promise you it won't hurt? It always hurts. Wait. What was that? He said, "It'll all be over with before you know it." You do know he's just a stuffed animal. Yes. But he's a wise stuffed animal. Oh, my God! All right. Why was Dr. Caldwell talking about grandma? Oh, just, you know, boring grown-up stuff. I feel like all anyone does anymore is keep secrets. Yeah? Like what? You and grandma. I know you're fighting. The thing is, sweetie, grandma did some really, really not nice stuff. That doesn't mean you have to do not nice stuff in return, you know? Mom wouldn't like this. She wouldn't want you fighting over me. When did you get to be so smart? Someone has to be. Savage. Man. It's work, isn't it? You always have to go. You know what? Why not we go get some ice cream? Rocky road? Is there any other flavor? This is Beverly. Hi, sorry to bother you. My name is Claire Johnson. I'm calling from Wellspring Home Nursing Care. Can I help you? We've been trying to reach Liam Martin, but he's not answering his phone and you were listed as an alternate contact. Is there something wrong? He requested to see the background check - of his home nurse. - And? I checked and we actually never sent a home nurse to Mr. Martin. But Victoria. We sent over a number of candidates, but it was our understanding that he selected an independent provider. This Victoria is not one of ours. - Go, go, go! - Stop! Look out! Oh, my God! Oh, no. Pick up, pick up. Hi, you've reached Liam. I'm not here. Please leave a message. Thanks. Hi, Liam, it's me. Please call me as soon as you get this. It's about Victoria. She's not who you think she is. Did you forget your house keys? Oh, Beverly, I didn't know we were expecting you. Where is he? Liam? They haven't returned yet. Right. Liam? No. I told you he's not here but I'd be happy to tell him you stopped by. Oh, thank you, Victoria. Should I say Catherine? I knew you looked familiar, - but I couldn't place it. - Beverly, I... After Amy died, I had a responsibility to look after the business and our family. What exactly do you think you're doing here? I'm getting my family back. Your family is gone. I know you've been dosing her tea. - What? - Yeah. I took some the other night. I couldn't understand why I wasn't feeling well, but then the doctor found doxadone in my system. Highly dangerous for pulmonary patients, but any nurse would know that. I just... I just need her to be sick a little while longer. Here's what I need. I need you to get in that car, get out that door, and I never wanna see you near Liam or Corinne again. I'm sorry, Beverly, but I can't let you take my family away from me. I've lost them before and I'm not gonna lose them again. Just relax, okay, you're not gonna die. It's just gonna keep you from talking. And you know what? Don't worry. I will be happy to tell Liam that you stopped by. Hi there, my two favorite people. - I'm gonna go upstairs. - Okay. How about a tea? - Sure. - Yeah. I'll bring it right up. Um, uh, everything okay? Yeah. Everything's fine. Um, are you gonna be home tonight? Yeah. I'm gonna be in the home office for a bit. Um, okay. Would you mind if after I bring Corinne her tea, maybe I run out for an errand? - That's fine. - Great. Hi, Liam, it's me. Please call me as soon as you get this. It's about Victoria. She's not who you think she is. Hi, you've reached Beverly. - You know what to do. - Come on. Hi, Liam, this is Claire over at Wellspring. I wanted to get back to you regarding your request for a background check on your nurse. The thing is, we never placed a nurse in your home. So I'm unable to provide any information at this time. What? It's impossible. Hello? Eleanor, hi. This is Liam Martin. We spoke a while ago about my home nurse, - Victoria Jones? - Ah, of course. Did it work out? Actually, I'm curious you did employ her through the agency, right? - Uh, Wellspring? - Uh, I did. Why do you ask? Well, I just asked them for some more information. They told me that she doesn't work for them. Are you still there? I am. You did tell me that she was, and I quote, "A godsend." Absolutely. Victoria Price was the best nurse I've ever had. - Price? - No, Jones. I said Jones. You know, I'm sorry, but now isn't really very good time, and I have a terrible connection. Good bye, Mr. Martin. Hi, you've reached Beverly. You know what to do. Liam, hey. Did Beverly get ahold of you? No, no, no. She left a message. And I've been trying to call her back but she's not answering. Well, she ran out of here pretty fast, seemed urgent. Did she say where she was going? To you. I'm home. Hello? Liam? Sweetie? Are you here? Tell me. Which one is "sweetie"? Where's Liam? He had to pick something up back in the office. And you're watching Corinne? Is that surprising? No. I just didn't realize you two were, you know... Well... there aren't that many people that he can trust. I suppose not. Come on, Beverly. What is it? I understand that Corinne has become a big fan of tea. - Of my tea. - Hmm. Well, I'm sure she can make do just this once. Yes. I'm sure she can. Wait. What? Oh, my. Oh... What, what... oh. Oh God, what... Please. Miriam, listen to me. Victoria is not who you think she is. Miriam! Miriam! Hi, honey. Why don't you come home? And come alone for Corinne's sake. Grandma? You know you should be resting. You know what exercise can do to you. Don't worry. Daddy will be home soon. Come on, pick up. Miriam, pick up your phone, come on. Hello. You've reached the voicemail of Miriam Hoffman. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Miriam, this is Liam. I need you to call me right away. It's important. Damn it. - Corinne? - Dad! Baby. Hey, what's this? Dad, look out! Liam. Liam, wake up. Help. What's going on? What's it look like, sweetie? We're having a family dinner. I was waiting for you. I missed you. I hope you're hungry. Oh, it was you. What did you do to Beverly? We are not talking about her. Right now we are... we are talking about us. Oh, my God. Okay. Just, look, honey, you're making our daughter upset. It's all right, sweetheart. Mommy's right here. Don't you dare act like her mother. Stop! You know, a year ago, I was happy. I was a mother. And I was a wife. I had a good job. I had a... I had a home. Catherine. No. It's Victoria. - Victoria. - No. And then that woman took all of it away from me. That woman was my wife! Yeah. Exactly. Was. How is hurting us going to bring your family back? Oh, oh, no. You don't understand. No, I would never hurt you. Uh-uh. No. Not my Liam. Not my Corinne. Now, you see, she took my family. So, I am gonna take hers. Do you realize that it's been exactly a year? Three hundred and sixty-five days of what? Of loneliness... of misery... of complete suffering, and for what? And then... and then when Corinne got sick and she needed a nurse, it was as if somebody said, "Here. Here, this is the chance for you to be happy, that you've been alone long enough." And both of us, we can... we can all be happy. And Corinne, we can... we can be a family. Absolutely. Yes, baby, yeah. I see it. I see it now. Thanks, sweetheart, come here. Come here, baby. Come here. Come here. Look at me. It needed to be this way. I didn't see it before. I didn't see it, honey. I didn't see it and you've been alone for so long. Yeah. I'm so sorry. Hang with your family. Okay, but right now, our baby girl she's hurting, okay? And you're such a good mama, okay? I need you to go loosen her up. You need to help her breath right now because I can't. - Okay, sweetheart? - Okay. And then, we'll be together. I'm not going anywhere. - I'm right here, okay? - Yeah. I promise you. Okay. Okay. Hey. Baby, baby. Come here. Come here. Hey, hey. Hey, deep breath. Deep breath, okay. Deep breath. There you go. Breathe another nice and slow. Okay. Okay. Okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay, baby. - Dad! - Hey, sweetie. We came to check on our girl. And we brought company. Now this is my kind of medicine. - Hey, doc. - Hi. So, how are both of my patients? I'm actually feeling a lot better. Well, you will continue to. There's no reason why you can't make a strong and full recovery. It'll just take some time. They tell me, I got a bit of physical therapy ahead of me, but I have a feeling that Corinne and I are gonna manage this recovery the way we managed everything best together. Glad everything worked out. - Oh, my gosh, yes. - Thank you for all your help.
