They'll label me a terrorist, but I'm a patriot. ( distant people chattering ) We have to take back this country, shine a light so that its darkest secrets will scatter like roaches. When these clandestine operations are exposed, you'll see the CCA for what it really is-- men and women who love this country too much to see it fail, people who want to be free. I don't want to die, but if that makes you see the truth, then so be it. I hope this makes you think. I hope it changes your life. - ( low rumbling ) - ( metal rattling ) ( people screaming ) ( alarm sounding ) ( moaning ) ( growling ) ( coughing ) ( growling ) Man over P.A.: This is a security lockdown. Please remain at your workstations. This is a security lockdown. Please remain at your workstations. The authorities are on the way. Hey, shouldn't you be doing something about this? ( growling ) - Man: This is a security - You're all right. - Please remain at your workstations. - You're all right. - ( alarm buzzing ) - ( distant horns honking ) ( alarm stops ) Woman: Allie, Allie, stop it. Allie: But I can help you. Woman: No, you can't. Dad lets me help him. Well, Daddy also doesn't do anything but look at a computer all day. All right? - ( teapot whistling ) - Go get your shoes for me, sweetie, please, so we can get out of here. Thank you. Have fun, okay? Promise? Hi. ( music playing over P.A. ) ( security wand beeping ) Guard: Raise your arms slightly. Good morning, Mr. Milner. What do you guys do when somebody brings in a weapon? Everything's gonna be fine, Mr. Milner. Because everybody's always who they appear to be? Merry Christmas, sir. Raise your arms slightly. ( door lock beeps ) Female voice: Floor one. First day in the building? Cell phones don't work in here-- some sort of security thing. It'll be a paperweight till we get back down to the lobby. Thanks. No problem. First days are always tough. I'm just visiting. Good for you. I never get to go anywhere. I just sit in my cubicle every day. Female voice: Floor six. Nice talking to you. Oh. Sorry. Wrong floor. For a birthday party? How did you guess? What kind of cake is it? The kind with icing. Mother: Keep an eye on her today, okay? Woman: Is everything okay? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know. Just, you know, she's trying to get any excuse to stay home. Woman: That's just normal separation anxiety. I think if she stayed here more consistently, though... Yeah, don't get me started on that. I promise she's safe here, Mrs. Milner. Please don't call me that. Sweetie, I gotta go. - You be a good girl, okay? - Mm-hmm. - Promise? - Mm-hmm. - 'Cause Santa's watching you. - Mm-hmm. - Love you. - Love you, too. Okay, Allie, say bye to your mom. Mother: Bye. Female voice: Floor four. ( Christmas music playing ) - Hi. - Hi. How is she? Do me a favor, Cale, don't let her stay with you at work. It makes me the bad guy. It helps her learn. Yeah, how to pull the fire alarm pulls on every floor. She remembered that? She asked if she could pull one and then we could all go home. That's my girl. You're not helping. Female voice: Floor six. Cale: I'll try to be a better dad, Carol. Excuse me. Female voice: Floor 10. Hey, George, what's up? We got an email outage on seven, a problem workstation on 11, and a bunch of newbies to train. You want me to take the outage? Until you get some help. Then I'm gonna need you on 11. - Okay. - And I'm expecting a full day of inane calls about emails vanishing, so be prepared for that. - Who are we got on schedule? - I'll check, all right? Female voice: Floor 12. ( distant horns honking ) ( Christmas music playing ) I see you've decorated for the holidays. - It's holly, not mistletoe. - Are you sure? Ryan, I've told you I have a boyfriend. Baby, you have a thug on a leash. Mm-hmm, and I can get him to kick your ass. Ooh, I like that. - ( phone ringing ) - Ciao. ( woman moaning ) We need someone discreet. He'd be assisting in a federal investigation. In fact, I might have already said too much. You could be a security risk, for all I know. I've already passed two background checks or we wouldn't be sitting here. You know that, Mr. Williams. Yes, well, I like everything to be checked and double-checked. ( computer beeping ) ( beeping ) Female voice: Floor 12. What's up? - Cale, what's up? - Hey, Sheb. Email's down on seven. And I'm going to 11. Check this out. I won't tolerate anything less than perfection. Your tie is crooked. ( Williams clears throat ) Sheb: Dude, you gotta let me go to 11 for you. George gave it to me. - Sheb: But your wife's in the building. - Ex-wife. You know you can totally work it out with her. Yeah, well, I totally won't. And I'm going to 11. Female voice: Floor six. Can I help you? Sorry. Haven't seen you here before. I usually work nights. Who are you? ( low rumbling ) ( metal rattling ) - ( people screaming ) - ( alarm sounding ) George: That was a bomb or a freakin' plane. To the exits, everybody. Get out of the building, people. Cale: We gotta do the backups. Screw the backups. They won't care when the building collapses. You guys go. I'm gonna do the backups. Look, it's not gonna collapse. That's what they said about the towers. That was before we got the colored alert systems. Nothing collapses on yellow. Go. ( alarm sounding ) ( growling ) ( people screaming ) Dispatcher: 555, respond to 27-Baker at the federal building on Oak Plaza. - ( police siren wailing ) - Policeman: 555, copy. 555, en route to the federal building. ETA is five minutes. ( people screaming ) ( growling ) Policeman: 555, copy. Responding. Please notify EDU and send me additional units. Dispatcher: Copy, 555. Man over P.A.: This is a security lockdown. - What the hell? - Please remain at your workstations. The authorities are on the way. ( screens beeping ) Man over P.A.: This is a security lockdown. Please remain at your workstations. The authorities are on the way. Man over P.A.: This is a security lockdown. Please remain at your workstations. The authorities-- ( coughing ) You're all right. You're all right. ( siren wailing ) ( coughing ) Policeman: Responding to your request for stagingfire as well as haz-mat units. Man over P.A.: Please remain at your workstations. The authorities are on the way. Dispatcher: 555, staging is gonna be in front of the building. Additional haz-mat units en route. Policeman: 555, copy. Hey, shouldn't you be doing something about this? ( growling ) Keep moving! Shut the hell up, old man. ( screams ) ( people screaming ) Man over P.A.: This is a security lockdown. Please remain at your workstations. The authorities are on the way. Man: Get out of the stairwell. - It's locked. - How do you know? It's part of the security procedure. The only way out is down. We can't go down. They're coming up. Now if we don't get out of these stairs, we're dead. Follow me. Man over P.A.: This is a security lockdown. Please remain at your workstations. The authorities are on the way. What the hell is going on? The lower floors are contaminated. Now, this group was above the cloud. Now it's safe to assume that everybody else is dead. Everyone can't be dead. At the very least, they're contaminated. They're-- they're infected, so it's just a matter of time. How do you know that we're okay? Well, you didn't walk through the vapor, right? So that's how I know. Anyone below the sixth floor wasn't so lucky. What are you doing? Where are you going? I'm gonna get my daughter. She's on the fourth floor. - Nobody's going through there. - Why? If you want to see your daughter again, then you have to listen to me. - You know what's going on? - Yes, I do. I'm not sure the extent of it yet. Are you willing to help me? ( people coughing ) 555 arriving. ETA for EDU? 25's on scene. Stand by for a size-up. Dispatcher: Received, 25. Wait for additional orders. We'll be in and out before anyone gets here. Dispatcher: Negative, 25. What's the reason for the designated truck? Dispatcher: 25, stand down. This is straight from the chief. We've got feds coming in from Washington. All right, we're on standby. ( people wheezing, growling ) - ( woman screaming ) - What was that? You want to meet whatever's making that noise? They're infected. - We've got to block this door. - Nobody's getting through that lock. - Come on, follow me. Let's go. - ( banging on door ) - Now do you believe me? - Go, go. - What's going on? - There's more infected on those stairs. Well, shouldn't you shoot them or something? Williams, that could be somebody from our floor. Nobody's shooting anyone. We need to find a way to monitor what's going on in the building. How about the security feeds? Are you supposed to have access to that? I know every password in the building. Most of the security cameras are either knocked out or showing empty rooms. So we're the only ones left? The only healthy ones. There are plenty of infecteds. Tony: Like those on the stairs. - Doctor, what's going on? - I can't say. - The phones don't work. - Lockdown. Even the phones? Whatever happened inside this building is obviously not intended to get out. Wait a second. You were in the lab. Why aren't you infected? I happened to be in the restroom. That was lucky. Cale: Well, then how can you be so sure that my daughter's infected? She's in the nursery on the fourth floor. I'm Dr. Richard Andzari, one of the project leaders on F-squared. - F-squared? - You said you knew everything. Just the passwords, Doc. Your ex-- Carol-- worked with me on the project. She didn't tell you about it? None of the high security stuff, no. About your daughter-- I'm very sorry. Ann: Oh, my God. ( lights buzzing ) There's been an explosion at the federal building. We're on the scene, standing by. And we'll get you more information as soon as it becomes available. - Under the tree. Yes. - Man: Merry Christmas, Chief. It doesn't matter, okay? I really gotta call you back. - The press is here. - Tell them two minutes. Okay, I love you. I'll call you later. Chief, I'm Dr. Otis Wexler. I'm the doctor in charge of the laboratories in that building. You're gonna have to pull your people back. No, no, no, no, there are people in the building. Loham, I got this, okay? Thank you. What's going on? It's an airborne agent, and by design it will be dispersed everywhere. Haz-mat only, full suits. It's not gonna be inert for several hours. And in this exact time, it's deadly, very dangerous. What the hell you got in there? I can't tell you, Chief. It's part of a Loss Less Victory program-- inventing new ways to bring down the enemy without losing American lives. What about the lives lost today? Why are we safe on the 10th floor? Smoke always rises. No, it's heavier than air, like a pesticide. You drop it over the troops the same way you crop-dust a field. Breathing it induces a combination of extreme anger and paranoia caused by over stimulating the adrenal glands. For the infected, everyone is a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism goes into overdrive and they kill others out of aggression or fear. - So the enemy kills each other. - What's the cure? There is none. ( beeping ) Other targeted areas include White Sands, New Mexico, Edwards Air Force Base, California, a federal building in Houston, NORAD, Colorado. How did they get bombs in all those buildings? - They had to use the mail. - It didn't come in the mail. I deliver the mail to you every morning. - You do? - Yeah. Thanks for noticing. Quiet. Guys, this is outside. All I can tell you right now we've clamped everything down around the federal building. We don't know what's going on inside. It's about time they got here. Someone's getting sued if we're not rescued soon. They won't be coming in. Grosso: As soon as I have some more information, I'll tell you folks. That's it, okay? No, I'm not taking any more questions, no. Pilot: This is 275 Delta from Washington, DC, requesting emergency landing clearance. Check it out, Doc. Looks like you were wrong. Thank God. - Entering hot zone. - Just like last night, right, Lou? What was her name? Dispatcher: Cut the chatter, boys. We're setting up decon at the exit point. Lou: Lobby appears empty. Continuing to the stairs. Dispatcher: Received. Keep us updated. I lost them on the staircase, but I can find them again when they come out. Dispatcher: Haz-mat 1, report. What's the APD read-out? No gamma rays. We've got us a body here. Dispatcher: Received. We'll notify... ( growling ) Dispatcher: Haz-mat 1, report. Some psycho woman on a rampage. Repeat, some psycho woman on a rampage. We're under attack! Dispatcher: Report, Haz-mat 1. ( man screaming ) Dispatcher: What's going on, guys? Dispatcher: Report. ( man screams ) ( man screaming ) Put down your weapon! Put down your weapon! Grosso: Don't shoot. Hold your fire. Hold your fire. You're okay. Stay down. Stay down. ( growling ) You're all right. Jesus. Back away from the blood. Who the hell are you? I'm Agent Wilson. This is Agent Riley. Weren't you given orders to wait for us? They shot their own guy. No one's coming in, not after that. This is bad. They might look normal, but the minute something angers them or frightens them, they cease to be the person you knew. I've never seen anything move like that in my entire life. Well, this substance-- it causes the adrenaline to run unchecked throughout your entire body. There's no way you can maintain that level of output. Look, how do we make them right? Well, we have a drug, but it's only a maintenance drug. We have to administer it regularly like insulin. - Where do we get that? - In there. Williams: Hey! Hey, up here! We've got to alert them. They're not gonna know what to do anyway. You're wrong. That's Dr. Wexler-- my superior. He knows more about it than anyone. They'll assume that we're infected. And if we go down, we will be. So let's go up. The doors are all locked. No, no, no, the roof doors are always unlocked. It's part of the fire escape system. I'm a private investigator. I've entered a few buildings through the roof. She's right. ( sirens wailing ) Wilson: A bullet to the head is the only thing that will stop them. ( police radio chatter ) You are going to lose more lives if you stand here and do nothing. These people just suffered a terrorist attack. We need to get in the building. We don't know what they've suffered. And when we do, we'll let you know. In the meantime, try not to panic. Riley. Get the press onboard. Be nice. Yes, sir. - They'll see us from the roof. - And we can use our cell phones. It doesn't matter. They're killing everyone they see. That's not true. They're killing people who act infected. I don't think infected people are making phone calls. Andzari: Maybe, but they won't risk picking us up until after dark. - Cale: Why? - The chemical changes from a vapor to a powder and becomes completely inert at that time. As long as they avoid contact with blood and saliva, this outbreak can be isolated. Well, if no one is gonna come and get us, I'm gonna go to the fourth floor and get my daughter. I hate to state the obvious, but if she's on the fourth, then she's-- Andzari: It's still too early. In a few hours you'll have a chance, but right now you'll die trying. - I'm going down. - That's suicide. Let's go to the roof and get help. ( police radio chatter ) If we need you, we'll let you know. - ( keyboard keys clicking ) - ( radio chatter ) What do we have here? How long is the virus contagious? Well, we're at the beginning of the second stage now, which means you can only get the thing transmitted through bodily fluids. - So we're clear at 6:00? - Oh, no, no, no. You wouldn't be safe entering that building before midnight. Chief, you got a chopper on the way? Give me 10 minutes. Command to Air Ops. Andzari: Do we still need this? Yeah, well, if you're wrong about the roof, we're gonna need to get back in. Are you sure we're not breathing it? It's settling into a powder on the lower floors. Why does it change? To keep it localized to the combat area. We want the whole front line wiped out but we don't want it picked up by a weather system. I thought bioweapons were banned. That's what you're supposed to think. - Don't. Don't shoot. - Don't move. Look, just shoot 'em. What are you waiting for? We work on the ninth floor. We're just trying to get to the roof. Check her eyes. She's not infected. ( light switch clicks ) All right, let's go. Move it. Move it, come on. - Come on. - ( women whimpering ) Tony: Go, go. ( radio chatter ) Sweep the roof. The picture might be distorted. The building has scramblers. Copy that. We'll circle the roof. Hang on, sir. Can you see this? ( people shouting ) Get as close as you can, but do not land until we get a good look at them. Copy that. He's alive. Grosso: Who? - Andzari. - Who's Andzari? The doctor who's supposed to keep this a secret. ( alarm beeping ) Tony: Come on, move. Move. Go, go. Down. Get down. Hurry up. Cale: What about the others? I want to know who that is right there. ( radio chatter ) 555. This is officially a no-fly zone. Everything comes through us. Why don't you do me a favor and tell me what's really going on here? ( siren wailing ) 555. I'm en route to the suspect's last known address at 245 Southwest King Street. She has your eyes. Mandy. I'm Cale. Williams: I'm sorry. I should have let you leave when all this started. Then we wouldn't be here. Andzari: Yeah. You'd be dead. Hey. I'm Ryan. I'm Tony. Leave the waters for someone else. - We've got plenty. - I'm good, man. Don't be a hero, man. Just take the water. Female reporter: Authorities are speculating that the explosionwas not incendiary in nature. Police are interviewing the witnesses. Do you believe any of this crap? Reporter: ...and the families for further information. They think it's one of us gone postal. Reporter: Police chief Grosso held a press conference. Here's what he had to say. Grosso: All I can tell you right now is we've clamped everything down around the federal building. We don't know what's going on. Leary to 555. Hold position. I repeat, hold position. Our friends in the back staircase again. Ann: Sounds like the locks are holding. As long as they're locked out there, we're safe in here. Safe? We gotta get the hell out of here. There's nowhere to go. We have to wait for rescue to come to us. If it comes. Leary to 555. On scene, entering back door. Man: Police department! Open up! Clear. Clear. Call Forensics. Let's send in the medics. My SWAT team can defend them. No one is entering any of these locations. Johnson, can you give me five? Sure, Chief. This is my jurisdiction. This is my responsibility. All of these locations were hit within 15 minutes of each other. It was a very professional operation which must remain a secret from the public. You don't think the public knows about this? No. Well, maybe we should fill them in. We can rally like we did with the Twin Towers. This is different, Chief. Did you ever hear of MK-ULTRA? It was a mind control program from the '60s-- LSD, special cocktails of psychotropic drugs. Our research springs from that. You've heard of Area 51. It's been top secret since the '50s. And it's our job to keep this secret from the public. - Johnson: Chief. - What is it? We're ready to pull the plug. We're on our way. Wilson: Chief. I want you to put your snipers under Riley's command. Cale: Grab a couple. ( distant gunfire ) Tony: I'm gonna check the staircase. Great. ( lights buzzing ) - Chief, we're going in, right? - Ask the feds. What, we're just gonna let people in there die? You got the initial group, right? I got a few in quarantine, yeah, but they were already out when I got here. That may be all you get. ( growling ) - ( screams ) - Tony: Calm down! - Ann: Don't shoot. - Calm down! Ann: Don't shoot. June? ( growling ) What are you doing? - ( gunfire ) - ( Ann screaming ) Wait, wait, wait, wait. ( growling ) - ( rapid gunfire ) - ( June screaming ) ( stops screaming ) She's down. I thought the doors were locked. The doors are all electric. We lost them all when the generator went down. So all the doors are unlocked? And there could be others out there? Look, IS use these for emergencies. We can all keep in touch while we're in the building. - So just radio the cops. - No, the scramblers work on them, too. We're not gonna reach outside, but between floors we can keep in touch. Where are you going? To get my daughter. Williams: You're insane. Haven't you been listening to the doctor here? ( grunts ) - ( gunshots ) - ( June screams ) The powder's probably still airborne below the fifth floor. Were there no backup contingencies for this? Well, we have gas masks in the lab, but I don't know what kind of shape they're in and we don't have enough for everybody. We only need a couple. Cale. Take this. Thanks. ( siren wailing ) Cale. Cale, can you hear me? What good is a radio if you don't turn the damn thing on? - Where are you going? - Cale needs help. Well, then I'm going with you. There's no way I'm staying here anymore. Williams: Are you gonna leave us without a weapon? Do you even know how to use one of these things? Oh. All right, Doc, what happens if one of us gets infected? The only defense is the blocker. I'm sorry, the what? We made a blocker. It's not a cure. Think of it like insulin. It-- it prevents symptoms. If you're infected, it keeps you normal. Why didn't you tell us about this before? Because it's probably all gone. All the doctors in the lab knew about the safe. Ryan, you grab a walkie and you give one to Dr. Andzari. You're gonna lead us to it. Williams: You just expect us to stay here, huh? And do what? ( sniffs ) ( gasps ) Oh, God. - Are you okay? - What are you doing here? You forgot to turn on your radio. - The doctor's been hiding a cure. - What? It's not really a cure. It's some sort of inhibitor. But there's a lot he's not telling us. Mandy: Oh, God. Ryan: This guy obviously wasn't doing his job. Cale: Don't be a jerk. Mandy: Guys, come on. Hey, Doc, this dust won't affect us, right? Andzari: The powder is inert, but to be safe, leave it alone until you have a gas mask. Ryan: Why is this place not burned to shit? Cale: It must have been concussive, not explosive. Are you an expert now? Doc, where do we look? The masks will be in a glass-front cabinet and the blocker is in the safe. The safe's empty. Andzari: Are you in the outer lab? Cale: No, the inner lab. Andzari: Check the safe in the outer lab. They got more than one safe of this stuff? Ryan: I'm telling you, man, that guy is shady. ( growling ) - ( grunts ) - Are you okay? Yes, yes, I'm sorry. I just need a minute. Are we supposed to take these to the bathroom with us? Probably should. ( growling ) Yeah. No, no, you're gonna have to take the kids and I'll meet you up there. I'm not in charge anymore. The feds are. Because it's my responsibility. This is my city. No, no. I'll call you back. ( sighs ) ( phone beeps ) Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, just the wife, you know, wants me back for Christmas. ( exhales ) These things are useless. The explosion damaged them. - ( growling ) - What was that? ( snarling ) Mandy! - Are you all right? - I'm not cut. I'm okay. Mandy. Hey, give us a hand. - Are you okay? - Yeah. What are you doing? That's-- that's Mandy's gun. I'm getting out of here. We'll go together. You are not in charge. Ryan, you're gonna get yourself killed. You think? Shit. ( sniffing ) Here, freaky, freaky. ( snarls ) No, I did not see your package. Go bitch at someone else. ( gunfire ) ( panting ) - ( snarling ) - ( gunfire ) ( snarling stops ) ( Mandy over radio ) Ryan, are you okay? Yeah. I'm just finishing off a straggler. Just wait for us. We're clear. I'm going for backup. Oh, God. All right, come on. Our boy's a right-wing fanatic counting on the government to make a mess of this so people will start asking questions, part of a group called CCA-- Concerned Citizens Alliance-- some pretty chilling stuff. ( man on tape ) &quot;Government does not keep the people free.&quot; Henry David Thoreau. - Are you okay? - She's not here. - Who? - My wife. My ex-wife. Ex, huh? So what happened? Money? Sex? Trust? No, none of those things. Look, I'm sorry. I see a lot of that in my line of work. I just guess I didn't turn out to be the guy she thought she married. - Ann: Where are you going? - To the restroom. Again? Are you all right? ( growling ) ( screaming ) ( thuds ) - ( growling ) - ( gunfire ) - How long has the power been cut? - About three hours. So it'll be six hours right around 10:00, correct? - What's your point? - The point is I want to know protocol behind D&amp;D. Destruction and deniability-- that's what you're really waiting for, isn't it? That's why you won't let anybody in here. What's that? This is the manifesto from the suicide bomber. He seems to have known quite a bit. &quot;Government does not keep the people free.&quot; Henry David Thoreau. Yeah, well, if only Carol could see me now, she wouldn't believe it. Her dad was a Navy Seal. ( gunfire ) Cale, there's nothing wrong with the man you are. ( growling ) ( gunfire ) Okay, go find your daughter. I'll figure out a way to get around him. Looks like we don't really have much of a choice, do we? Be careful. They'll label me a terrorist, but I'm a patriot. We have to take back this country, shine a light so that its darkest secrets scatter like roaches. And when these clandestine operations are exposed, you'll see the CCA for what it really is-- men and women who love this country too much to see it fail, people who want to be free. I don't want to die, but if that makes you see the truth, then so be it. I hope this makes you think. I hope it changes your life. That is pathetic. Grosso: So the D&amp;D plan exists, doesn't it? You're gonna bring down that building? In the interest of national security, sensitive federal locations are prewired for demolition. Like building number seven at the World Trade Center? The system is connected to the power grid. Six hours without power-- it detonates itself. - That's insane. - Chief, be realistic. Anyone in there is dying anyway. We can't help them. All we can do is keep them from infecting the rest of us. You just want to bury the evidence. No, we want to contain the virus. Everyone in that building knew that job came with a risk. Nobody knew about the gas. Nobody knew that building was coming down around them. Cale, are you all right up there? ( Cale gasps ) ( Mandy over radio ) Cale, what's happening? ( growling ) Allie? Allie? ( growling ) Carol. Carol, hey. Oh, God. Carol, it's Cale. Carol? Yes, it's Cale. It's Cale. Cale? Cale? It's Cale. Oh, my God. Carol, where is Allie? Where's Allie? Gone. Gone? Gone where? It's okay. It's okay. No. ( screaming, snarling ) ( gunshot ) You didn't pick up your radio. Where's your daughter? She's gone. Oh, God. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's all right. No, no, it's not. I just killed your wife. She was already dead. ( pounding on door ) Williams: Open up! Open up! Damn it. Get back up here. We found Andzari. He's had the serum all along. How do you know? He's in the bathroom shooting up. It's been keeping him alive. He's infected. Look, just stay away from him. We'll get you out. ( screaming ) What are we gonna do? If we can make it to the second floor, we can use this. Okay. What is it? It's just the last call she made. Man: You find a shot, take it. Don't radio for authorization. Look, I know that truth doesn't make good copy and the conspiracy stuff does, but I promise we operate aboveboard. You want some? You've had it all along, you bastard. Well, we can all sit down and be calm. He's gonna wait, and Dr. Wexler is gonna-- Man: Whoa! Shit. Ann. Ann. Let's talk about that raise you've always wanted. ( screaming ) What are you doing? I'm gonna measure out enough to get us to the second floor, and then I'll tie it off. I am not climbing down that thing. Neither am I. We're gonna jump. - What? - We gotta get past that guard. You're right. We're gonna need some protection. Come on, follow me. Grosso: I want you guys going through floor by floor. Keep somebody on the bottom two levels so we can maintain contact at all times. If you find any survivors, we've got the fire boys standing by. I've got an evac chopper on its way. I'm afraid you boys have about an hour and that's it. - That's not enough time. - Come on, let's rock 'n' roll. Let them go in. That building is gonna come down on all of them. Firemen and policemen are gonna be heroes. As you can see behind me, the power to the building has been shut down. Federal agents in charge of the situation have sent in rescue teams with night vision, giving them an advantage over the hostiles inside. Mandy: What makes you think these are gonna work? They're more likely gonna kill us than rescue us. We just got to get to the second floor where there's reception. Okay. We gotta get past that guard. All right, are you ready? Not even close. Okay, there's something I want to say to you first. ( growling ) Jump! - ( screams ) - ( gunshots ) ( groans ) ( cell phone ringing ) Carol. Carol, baby, it's me. Where are you? It's not Carol. It's her ex-- Cale. Where is she? She went back for Allie. She didn't make it. Allie's fine. She's fine. What? What? Where is she? Ever since the Oklahoma bombing, it's policy to evacuate the children first. Allie's in quarantine. It's just a precaution. Thank you. Thank you. She's okay. Thank you. Look, where are you? We're in the second-floor stairwell. Listen, there's two of us and we're not infected. So if you see us, don't shoot. If you see anyone else, they're probably infected. You've gotta get the hell out of the building. - They're about to level it. - What? SWAT is in there for a final sweep. The building is coming down. You've gotta get out. Well, you've gotta get them to stop. Chief. Cale: Inside. Just keep the streets locked down. I don't want anybody coming in and out. Chief. - We have live ones in there. - Are you sure? Yeah, I just talked to them. They're on the second floor. Are they infected? No. No. You've got to stop the demo of this building. I'm doing the best I can. Look, I'm going in. We've just been told all survivors have been evacuated. But the building has suffered severe structural damage. As you can see, we've been moved farther away from the building so that authorities can take it down safely. Man: As soon as possible. Freeze! No! She was shooting at him. ( gunfire ) How many got out? Well, beside you, 18. Six kids, including Allie. None are infected. - Where is she? - Sacred Heart. What about the other locations? The news said this was a training exercise. Oh, great. Now we're never gonna know. Mr. Milner, I'm Dr. Wexler. May we have a word with you? Would you give the guy a break? Thanks for getting me out. I'm coming with you. Mr. Milner, we're gonna need to go over your story. Feel better? Yeah. Keep your mouth shut. You've got some balls on you, man. Hey. Thanks. ( siren wailing ) Here's your story. Merry Christmas. ( cell phone ringing ) Yeah. I love you, too. Daddy, I'm sorry. For what? I pulled that alarm thing, but I didn't know I was gonna hurt the whole building. Oh, that wasn't you, baby. I love you, Daddy. I love you, too. Woman: Excuse me. Are you family? ( man on tape ) I don't want to die, but if that makes you see the truth, then so be it. I hope this makes you think. I hope it changes your life. ( instrumental music playing )
