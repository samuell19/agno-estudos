That’s the one, man. Dude, I mean, I think you should use the metronome because you’re always speeding in the same part. I know it sucks because you’ll have to… - Exactly, it sucks. - Well, you do know you’re speeding up then. Look, there’s something going on here, some frequencies... - …yeah, i got your message but... ...we had agreed to the start the venue - …there's a low frequency cancellation between the acoustic guitar and the bass. - Play the guitar! - ...If we play third that would be great, because it'll give us time to get there... - Go with the bass! - Go with the bass!!! …OK, OK, great then. I can call you if you want... Cool. - Who was it, man? - This guy who’s putting together a 90’s bands tribute and stuff. So, we're ready? - Let’s do “Frailejones”. - Dude, question: Did you just tell this person we’re going to play at Suena Caracas? - Excuse me? I asked you if you told this person we’re playing at Suena Caracas Festival. - Oh, yes. But just to save the date, that’s it. - But, to save the date for what? - Just in case… - OK. I guess you know I’m not going to play there, don’t you? -Well... ...I know we said we were going to think about it, didn’t we? - Yeah, but I made my point clear: I’m not going to do that shitty gig. - Yes, but the band is not just you, Andrés. - Exactly, man. - I mean, I don’t mind playing there... ...neither does Charlie. Well, Piwi... I haven’t asked him yet, but everything’s cool. - Hey, let's keep moving because we have no… - Are you guys for real? So you don't care if I play or not. - It doesn’t matter... - Wait, man... Let’s keep playing and we’ll talk about it later. It’s not the right time... - Answer me, doesn’t it matter to you? - Man, I didn’t say that, OK? You’re the one saying you don’t want to play. And I don’t know about you, but we are playing. You’re the one ditching us, dude. - Brilliant. Go suck some army dick. - Come on, Andrés, wait a moment. Let’s not be childish about this. - The power’s out. No electricity. - Andrés? Andrés?! - I’m here. - Here where? - In my room. - Are you going out again? - I don’t think so. - Lend me your car, then. You know, because of the gate… Is there something wrong? - No. - Well, I’ll be right back. Oh, by the way, don’t you open the fridge until the power is restored. I don’t want things to spoil. - Okay. - If you’re hungry, there are some bananas out there. - Hello? - Hello! - Hey, man. What's up? - Hi, how are you? - Fine, you? - Good, good. Are you busy? - No, no. Tell me. - Can you talk? Well, it’s a long story but I’ll try to make it short. I need… Hello? - Hello? Hello? - Hey, can you hear me? - Hello? - Hello? - I can’t hear you, man. Hello? - Can you hear me now? Hey, man. Look… ...well… I don’t know if you’ve heard about it or you saw what they posted... ...but I won’t be in the band anymore. Well, because of... ...stuff... ...issues, you know? What’s important here, however, and the reason I'm calling you... ...is because... ...most of the songs we recorded with you, well, they're mine, I wrote them. So I don’t know if... ...if they’ll keep playing or not, and I don’t give a damn. But what I want is to keep things clear... ...when everyone gets their songs, that we all know who owns each track. Because, I really don’t want them to keep any of the things I made. Neither the guitars, the keyboards nor the sequencing… nothing. Okay. Well, I can send you a list of my stuff by email ...so you don’t give them any of my compositions. -… And the texture lingers like this… - Nice, nice. - Did you like it? Well, we’d have to record the arrangements and stuff again. And…did you get the lyrics? - Yeah, yeah… It did remind me a bit of The Brian Jonestown Massacre. - You think so? Well, that’s something I’d like to change, to make it sound more local. - It’s not like it is a rip-off, with the same chords and all, but... ...the sound of it, the organs, tambourines… - Okay. Well, that’s something I’d like to change. Since we have to record them again... ....take those songs and add like... ...samples of aboriginal stuff and change the way they sound. I don’t know if you’ve heard of... ...this museum of aboriginal instruments in Mérida. Well, they have a recording studio. We could plan to go there, create a sound bank. And you could play them live with a sampler... ...and add some effects and let… ...some sounds playing in between songs… …and you could perform wearing a flashy dress, I don’t know what your favourite colour is ...but something like this… - Okay. - Wait, you’re saying you want to add all these things to the song you showed me? Or… - Well, yeah, this one and the others as well. I mean, I want us to start a band, together. - Okay, Okay… The way you said it, sounded like you wanted me to be a guest performer in a song... - No, no, in fact, if you don’t like this song, that’s okay. We’ll make a new one, I trust your taste. - No, no, I did like the song. The thing is that I don’t know if I’ll have the time to be in a band… …because I’m doing all the paperwork to… - Oh, no worries… that’s something I haven’t told you yet but... ...there will be no rehearsals. We could simply record... and I’ll adjust to your time. Like, if you tell me “I can only do it after midnight”. Well, I can adapt to that. The point is go for it. - Okay, Okay. The thing is that... ...I’m not feeling good with making music right now. It pisses me off, but... ...in the situation we’re in, with all the issues going on, sometimes it just feel´s like a whim. And I know, and I’m grateful I’ve been doing alright, but I don’t want to live in my parents’ house forever. I mean, I have a job, you have a job. And I know it may sound like a minor issue, like middle class people problems, but we’re privileged kids. - So, what are you going to do? - Nothing, just get the hell out of here. - Yes, of course. Wow, what a shame. Everybody’s leaving… Well, I guess if you have to go away… ...you have to go - But I really liked the song and I’d love to do it, but I’m about to leave. - Sure, yes. Sure, yes… Well, I guess this is it… ...We be at the office, me kissing your feet. I told you late, I know, just come over. We be at the pool, me making you a woman. I told you late, I know, just come over. We be at the office, me kissing your feet. I told you late, I know, just come over. We be at the pool, me making you a woman. Hey… Hey, man! Hey! Are you here on your own? - What? - I asked you if you were on your own. - Oh, no, no, no, no. Nope, I got some friends over there. - Dude, you must be out of your mind. People get mugged around here all the time, I wouldn’t suggest you to be alone. - Oh, Okay, Okay. - I’m telling you this for your own good. I know you want your privacy and stuff, but... ...you should be closer to where the people are. Don't go any farther. It would be a shame if something bad happened to you… - Okay, thank you. - No problem. …achieving, thanks to the fact Corpoelec is a state-owned company, and thanks to the electricity working class. Long live the electricity working class! - Hurrah! And who is this? Who is entering the room? Who is dragging my chair? I was always, hand in glove with circumstance. A flower that lives at the foot of the volcano. - Andrés… Andrés Bravo, here it is. OK, look, Andrés, the company, at the moment, for administrative reasons... we are trying to eliminate part-time work contracts. By the way, I have to talk to Ana Maria now. Do you understand? Yes, yes, I know that. That’s why I sent you a request by email, saying… I mean this is not permanent, it’s only while I organize myself. - Why don’t we do this: why don’t you ask for your vacations and take all those days off? - Fifteen days are not enough, Carmen. The idea is that I keep receiving an income, even if it's reduced, but I also want time to record my album, which is a priority for me this year. - I have a suggestion... - It's not my usual music-related leave. This time I have to do the recording, the singing, all the playing, mixing... ...and it is a bigger responsibility. - Well, first of all, that won’t be possible. Part-time won’t be possible. Here’s a suggestion: why don’t you draft a document like the one you sent us on email, and instead of asking for a part-time contract, you ask for an unpaid leave? How long do you think it’ll take you... ...those recordings, the music you’re telling me about? - About a month. - A month. Okay. Okay. APARTMENT RENTAL IN MACUTO 40 OBAMAS FOR SALE MORE INFO BY INBOX INSTRUMENTS SONGLIST - This is the kitchen. Here’s the A/C remote control. Do you know how to use the buttons? -Yes. - You must be careful with it; every time you go out, you must turn it off. The same with the stove. As you can see, the apartment is clean, and was painted very recently. There’s a little thing going on with the right window; it doesn’t open, because of the rust. So you have to open them from left to right. Here’s the fuse box, in case of any emergency. There’s a tank-type water heater; you have to plug it before you shower and unplug it when you’re done. There’s a trash chute in the hallway, and the water stopcock. How many people are staying here? - Hmm, just me. - In case someone else wants to stay here, you let me know. You must give me a copy of their ID and that’s about it. All right? - OK. - Here you have the keys. Welcome and enjoy yourself. - Thank you. - See you later. Here is the sun, paralyzing... ...my ivory skin. The sun, once again, behind the ventriloquist, is facing me. I unlock my lip today and the souvenir sprouts as you hear it here. Fuck yeah! - Hi, Andrés. How are you? I’ve been calling you, but it’s been impossible to reach you. My urgency is because I have an invitation for you, to participate in a show I've been putting together. and I’d love for you to be there. I’ll give you all the details when you call me back. The date, the time, etc. But I’m really interested in having Los Pijamistas playing there. In fact, I want you to be closing as the main event. So, as soon as you hear this, please call me back! - Hi! How are you? Well, I guess you haven’t read about it… and maybe you don’t know... I don’t play with Los Pijamistas anymore. In fact I don’t want to be even related to them. I thought you were calling me because of me, because I’m working on my own stuff, still with music, but you know, like, upgrading the whole concept. I mean, yeah, this is truly something else, way above... I’m sure you’ll be interested in this too, so I’m up for anything. Let me know what you think. Hope you're well! Do you know what we haven't talked about... and it's quite important? The name of this project. I mean, like, the name of our thing. I had thought of ‘Psico Delia Fiallo’, that sounds kick ass. But, it’s too long. So Jools Holland won’t be able to pronounce it. I’ve also thought of ‘The Narconephews’, which is also awesome. Fucking awesome... But, can you picture people trying to google us, trying to download our album... ...and they’ll only get criminals in yacht shoes. And... ‘The Clapton Bag’? However that would be for a band... that does regulated Eric Clapton covers, You get on stage, play a couple of chords like shit and then you go home. I mean, like… Like, it has to be something related to this, right? ...related to this concept. The thing is... I don’t know what you guys are. What are you? What the hell’s this, man? What are you??? Coming! - How are you? - How do you do? How are you, sir? - May I come in? - Yes. - I want to talk you because I was on a meeting with the condominium board... ...and they were complaining about the constant noise you’re making in here. When we signed the contract... I figured you were going to spend some spare days, reading a book or so; I saw you had some musical instruments, I assumed you were going to play some music but not that you’d make the noise they are talking about even late at night, 11 pm, midnight… They’ve also told me you’re not alone, which is fine by me, we talked about it, as long as you let me know and give me a copy of their ID. - Yeah, yeah, I know that, but I’m here on my own. No one else is here with me. Feel free to look around… - No, nope, I won’t do that, I don’t have to... You’re leaving soon. You know how condominium boards are like, you even know some of the owners. Someone has even mentioned there is a strong marijuana odor coming from here. Look, this is a beach apartment, for families, with children. I suppose you’re not smoking marijuana in this apartment. - Nope, nope. Of course not. - Do you find it funny? - Nope, I don't. - Because this situation is quite serious. OK, so I’m going to trust you. Please pull yourself together until you leave. All right? Thank you. Sir. - Hello. Pull over to the curb. ID, license, registration… - You haven't been in jail, have you? - No. - Open the back door, man. - What’s this? A tennis racket? - A guitar. - Step out of the vehicle. - Look, you know that talking on the phone while driving is fined with 10 tax-units? - Okay, okay. - Open it! - Oh, so you’re a musician. - What else do you do apart from being a musician? - I work in a lab. - What? - I work in a lab! - ...and you have a rock band. - Play something. - Misael! Misael! - No, no, wait for the officer to come. - He also plays, you know. - Let’s see. - Let him borrow it. - Let him borrow it. - Be careful that the strap sometimes slips off. - That’s a wrap. - Did you see that playing? - Yep. - Do you think my partner could borrow... ...your guitar, so he can play it from time to time? - Nope, nope... ...I can't. - Oh, come on. - I just can’t. - But why? I’m sure you have more guitars back home. - Sandoval, give him the guitar back. - Nope, he’s going to borrow… - Give it back. - Just for a little bit. - Give it back! - Come on, come on... Look, Mr. Andrés, your health certificate has expired. Your motor liability insurance? - I don’t have it right here. - Oh! So the expired health certificate… no liability insurance… the 10 tax-units fine… We’re going to have to seize the vehicle. A tow truck will arrive in a few minutes, we’ll hold it for three days while you do all your paperwork. - No, wait! Like, is there anything we can sort out so the car doesn't stay here? - We're doing our job… and we haven’t had lunch yet… - Well, I have some food in the trunk, I don’t know if… - Can you see that blue beach stand over there? You’re going to leave the bags there. I’ll look for them in a while. I’ll be watching you. If I see something fishy, you know what’ll happen to you, right? Sir, you can go now. - Thank you. - Hiya! So how was it? - Where? - Your recording, the music, the album… - Oh, right... Good, good. - Well, when the CD is out, I want one, signed by you, so when you become famous, I’ll say: ‘I helped this boy to do this thing’. - Good morning. - Checking account? - Savings. - …well, I mean, I need you to fix this. You have to answer for it. Either you do it again, and you do it right or… - But we already did this, pal. - Wait... ...so I can open the files in my computer, or you give me my money back. And obviously, being honest with you, I’d rather have my files back. That’s why I’m here, that’s why I brought the hard drive. - And I have to tell you again that we already did it. Don’t you get it? - But you didn’t do it right. - Look, man: we took all the files you had in your drive... ...and we burnt them in the DVDs we gave you, so if those files were damaged before, that’s not our fault. - Well, no, those files were good and they could be opened. I mean, I’m not blaming you; I’m asking you to try again, maybe there was an error when you burnt them. But… what are those files for? - They’re audio files. Music files. - You can get on the internet and download the music again, easy peasy. - That’s my music. From a music recording software I use to make it. - Didn’t you back up the files, man? - You must do some back up, bro. After this, you’ll learn to backup your files even three times for things like these, you know? - Okay. However, that is useless right now. I'd like to know if you’re going to check the DVDs or at least burn them again. - Look, man, let's do this: We will burn the files again, is that okay? But you have to pay again. - The thing is that I already paid for it. I’m not going to pay for a service you didn’t do right. - Here’s your hard drive. For these devices, there is a warranty and the manufacturer offers a replacement. However, regarding the data, we can only offer to send it to the manufacturer in the US, so they can run a test and then send a budget, plus a special fee for recovering your files, because that is not part of the warranty. - Okay. And how much will that be? - It depends on the type of work they have to perform, but around $ 600 or 700. - Okay. Fine, thanks... - The rumours were true, it’s over. How many times did I saw my spirit break But this time, I cannot stop singing. Scratching the crystal core. It’s the drop that broke the stone, the same drop that lets the song in. It’s the drop that broke the stone. Valerian for the heart. Unsuscribe from Los Pijamistas? Andrés! I was with Carolina and we were trying to remember that amazing 80’s song that goes like… So, I thought you could help us remember it, since you know about music. ...well, bye. - Hahahaha. - The synth during the brigde is the best. - How’s your album going? - Son? Son? Andrés? Don’t you have to work today? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - So? - Mmm, no, I’m not going today. - Are you feeling ill, darling? - Nope, no. I took the day off to do some stuff. - Is this dirty? - Nope, it’s clean. - Fold it then. - Shh, dammit! You’d have to keep going this way And that’s the path life goes by You would tell me this, always, always But I ignored those words I always took alternate paths I always took alternate paths. - Encore! Do ‘Frailejones’! 'Frailejones'! - Well, I can’t play ‘Frailejones’ because it’s a Pijamistas’ song. In fact, here’s one of the guys from the band. Great bassist!
