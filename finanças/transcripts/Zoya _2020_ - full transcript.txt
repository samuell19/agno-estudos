Did you know, Kiselyov from 9B promised to invite me. - Hello, Mrs. Kosmodemyanskaya! - Hi, Lena! - Have you seen Zoya? - Upstairs, go on up! - Thank you. How pretty you look! - Thank you. GRADUATION 1941 Mom is here. Mom! What are you thinking about? Happiness. What is there to think about? It's either there or it's not. You know, sometimes it seems like it's there. Then I think about it and it seems not. And right now? Right now, I think it's there. You know, I think I feel it too. - Yes? - Happiness. - Really? - Yes. I didn't feel it yesterday but today I do. You do? You... Why did you do that? That's happiness. Oops! - I'm sorry! - Sorry, guys. Well now? - Hurray! - Hurray! Attention! Moscow is speaking! Today, June 22, at 4 a.m., without declaring war, Nazi troops attacked our country. ZOYA - Hello. - Hello. The fearless Red Army is fighting against the enemies in a battle, the likes of which the world has never seen. At night, warding off the attacks of enemy planes on our cities and towns, searchlights flare up blindingly... - Oh, Gene. - Hello. Hello, Mrs. Kosmodemyanskaya. Hi, Gene. Zoya's not here. How can that be? They told me she got back from the crop harvest yesterday. - Yes, she did. - Well, it's her birthday today. She went off to school. But our school... It got hit by a bomb. Yes. Gene, come back in the evening. Zoya decided not to celebrate her birthday. It's just... How can we right now? But please do come back in the evening. For a cup of tea together, at least. Well, I... I won't be able to. I... I'm leaving for the front today. In that case, please tell her that I... Actually... never mind. Don't tell her anything. After we win the war, I'll tell her. - Alright. - Bye, Mrs. Kosmodemyanskaya. Goodbye. MOSCOW, TIMIRYAZEVSKY ENLISTMENT OFFICE 13 SEPTEMBER 1941 VICTORY WILL BE OURS Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene. Gene... Gene... Gene! Hey, beautiful, are you looking for me? I'm Gene! Come on, people, move it! Tick tock! Closer together! - Gene! - Come on, closer, closer! Zoya! Zoya... My little Zoya... Zoya...

We'll come home victorious. Zoya! - What's this? Does it hurt? - Vasilyev, now! I hadn't noticed. Don't worry. - It doesn't hurt a bit. - But there's blood. - Get home, quickly. - Vasilyev! Dress the wound. I'll be fine, Gene. I don't fear pain at all. Really! Zoya, Zoya... What is this! No discipline. Come on. Let them say goodbye. Who knows what's next. Wait for me, you hear? You have to wait. Wait for me, my little Zoya! Wait for me, Zoya! - Come on. - Let's go! Happy birthday! HITLER PLANNED TO TAKE MOSCOW NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 1941. BUT THE RED ARMY'S FURIOUS RESISTANCE STOPPED THE WEHRMACHT RIGHT AT ITS WALLS. THE NAZIS DIDN'T HAVE A PROPER WINTER UNIFORM OR ENOUGH FUEL. KNOWING THIS, STALIN SIGNED AN UNPRECEDENTED ORDER, KNOWN IN THE ARMY AS "DRIVE THE NAZIS OUT INTO THE COLD". VOLUNTEERS HEAD BEHIND ENEMY LINES - TO SET FIRE TO HOUSES OCCUPIED BY FASCISTS. MOSCOW, THE KREMLIN - Permission to enter, Comrade Stalin? - What do you have? What is this? "Wreck and burn to the ground all populated areas behind enemy lines to a depth of 40-60 kilometers from the frontline and 20-30 kilometers to the left and right of roads." Sixty kilometers. That's a great distance. And the people living in these villages, did you think about them? There's no other way, Comrade Stalin. Otherwise everyone will die. "To destroy the populated areas within the specified radius immediately bring in... aviation..."? Make wide use of artillery and mortar fire, scout teams, ski teams, partisan sabotage groups, equipped with bottles of flammable material, grenades and explosives. - Form a group in every regiment... - It's dark. I can't see anything. So then, Comrade Poskrebyshev, has everyone signed it? Affirmative, Comrade Stalin. If we don't take extreme measures now, we won't be forgiven. Even then we won't be forgiven. Nothing will be forgotten. And nothing will be forgiven. J. STALIN - I'll go to the front anyway. - Sasha, enough already. They already told you, you're still too little. First of all, I am not little! Secondly, I just didn't take the right approach. Pyotr Gerasimov added on a whole year, and he got a uniform straight away. Well, he was wrong to do that. It's lying. - You can't lie to people. - You can. If it's for the common good. I can't even talk to you. You're a little girl, you don't understand at all. And if that doesn't work, I'll run away. Hear me? I'll flee to the front. Like Vasya Kotikov? His precinct sent him home in two days. He didn't even get to the front, they took him off the train. Like I said, even you don't understand, and you're my sister. Well, you know Arkady Gaidar. At 17, he already commanded a whole regiment. Sasha, but you're not Gaidar, you're only 16. Wait for me here. Lena? What's wrong? Did something happen, Lena? Gene Vasilyev died. They killed him, Zoya. Do you understand? What... what are you saying? It... it can't be. Nina told me. They live in the same building just on different sides. NOTICE EUGENE VASILYEV DIED OF HEAVY INJURIES - So you've fired a rifle before? - Yes. - Would a parachute jump scare you? - I'm not scared of anything. During raids we stay out on the roofs. - We help put firebombs out. - That's good. Good work. - But the front is much more dangerous. - So be it, I'm not afraid. I swear as a Komsomolets. You're young for this kind of work. Very young. I'll manage. Why don't you believe me? Sit. Hello. Another girl wants to go to the front? Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya. Here, Comrade Shelepin. In your application it says that you are a student of German. Yes, our teacher said I'm a very quick learner. By the way, they don't say it like that. They would say: "Your application states that you studied German in school." I didn't understand a thing. But I see you understand. Can you guess why I asked you about German? You'll have to carry out tasks behind enemy lines. Now have another think. Will you manage? I will. Have no doubt, Comrade Shelepin. That's it. - Here, honey. - Thank you, Mom. - Right. - Mom... I want to ask something of you. Don't tell anyone where I'm going and where I'll be. I'm to report at the Colosseum cinema. From there they'll send us to the unit. And what will I tell Sasha? He will certainly ask. Say that I've gone to the village. To see Grandad. Here. OK. You'll be able to write, won't you? I'll try. KUNTSEVO, SABOTAGE AND INTELLIGENCE UNIT You have a lot to learn here. It will be tough. WESTERN FRONT INTELLIGENCE BASE NOVEMBER 1941 It will be very tough. But the toughest part lies ahead when you're behind enemy lines with a special mission from command. ARTHUR SPROĢIS, CHIEF OF STAFF I won't hide it, not many of you will be coming back. If you're taken prisoner by the Nazis, you will be tortured to death. So, those of you not willing to die for your country, should leave this camp immediately. What are you laughing at? - Surname? - Kosmodemyanskaya. Kosmodemyanskaya, step forward! - What's so amusing? - Nothing. But isn't it a joy to die for you country? For your loved ones? Get back in line. Get to work, Matvey. We don't have much time. On my command! Line up! Attention! March! - Come on, come on, move! - Good. - Lower you head, lower. - More lively! With a smile! - Hug the earth like your own mother. - Elbows wider! Insert the cartridge and spin the barrel clockwise. Clockwise. I insert the cartridge. And close. - Is everybody clear? - Clear. - Press down! - Lively, more lively! Elbows! Elbows in! - Use natural coverage to hide. - Backsides too! Faster, faster, move. Klubkov! What are you raising your head for? A bullet will hit it! First of all I want to tell you that a real saboteur doesn't need a weapon. We need you to get to the target area silently and covertly and carry out the mission. If you start firing at everything that moves, you'll die and risk the success of the mission. What does that mean? We won't be needing a weapon at all? You might need one. To shoot yourself. To avoid capture and being tortured to death. Attention! Left face! - Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief! - Begin. Comrade fighters, this is an order. The Nazi army is poorly adapted to war in this climate, they don't have warm clothing, and facing grave difficulties from the onset of frosts, they are huddling in populated areas close to the frontline. Drive the Nazi invaders out of the towns into the cold, into the field. Force them to freeze under the open sky. The leader of the country sets this task before you. You will receive combat orders directly from your commanders. It is possible that most of you will not return from this mission. But I want you to remember that the fate of Moscow and the outcome of the entire war depends on each one of you. And know that your homeland will always remember its best sons and daughters, 75 years, 150 years, 500 years from now. Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! - Are you afraid? - N-no, I'm not afraid. And if you fall into enemy hands? I will endure everything. At ease! You're not sleeping! Move! No sleeping! And remember making a fire in the forest is categorically discouraged. Fire is visible from every side. Even from the sky. Over the log. Smoke spreads over many kilometers. - So if you want to survive... - Come on, guys, come on. ...do not make fires! Fyodor, go. Oh my gosh. Help! Comrade Tsvetkov! Everybody stand down! Keep still! Lie down! I said... what are you doing? Keep still! Hang on! I wonder, can you sleep while walking? Right now it seems like I am. There's no point going to bed. We have to be up in two hours. That's for sure. Zoya! What are you doing? I want to see the stars, like in summer. But there are none. Maybe they've gone out. That's OK. We'll reignite them. Let's go. We have to get some sleep at least. A combat group must be deployed in the Volokolamsky district. In this square here. Their mission? Mining the road. Right here. Who do you plan to send? Why so silent, Tsvetkov? Well, any cadet will do. But, you know that turning a civilian into even a basic operative in three days is... It's practically impossible! - Three weeks, at minimum. - We don't have three weeks! We don't! The Nazis won't wait for you, Tsvetkov, to train your operatives. They're tearing towards Moscow. Do you understand? - I understand. - Then go and get the group ready. What now? - Permission to go with them. - Denied. We need you. New troops are coming. I just wanted to say that... with me they have a chance of returning. Listen to me, Matvey, they're adults. They're 18 years old. They're volunteers. And after all, they have an order, which they must carry out. Order received - prepare the group. Remember, what's most important for a saboteur? Correct, staying unseen in the forest. Finding points in the landscape, where no enemy will notice you. Blend into the landscape. VASILY KLUBKOV, SABOTAGE AND INTELLIGENCE GROUP Find natural coverage, that you can jump out from at any moment to fulfil the mission. Is that clear? VERA VOLOSHINA, SABOTAGE AND INTELLIGENCE GROUP RED GUARD IN THE WESTERN FRONT BORIS KRAINOV, COMMANDER OF THE SABOTAGE AND INTELLIGENCE GROUP Guys... try to come back alive. That's all I can ask of you. Come back for your sack of explosives... Boris, take charge. Troops! Into the vehicle! - Well, come on, get in? - Come on. OUTER MOSCOW, SHAKHOVSKAYA ROAD, KNYAZHI HILLS 7 NOVEMBER 1941 One tap. Danger. Come on, faster! A motorcycle. Nazis! Vera, come on already! - Stop. - Why? I have to go. Quickly, Russians are everywhere. Yeah, I know. What are you doing? Hurry up, come on. OK, OK. - Has it fallen off? - Shut up! Everything's fine. I haven't pissed like that for ages. Right. Well, well! What the hell? I don't get it. - I don't get it. - I forgot to connect the wires. - Wait! I'll do it. - It's my fault! It's OK. I'll be quick! Right. Where are you going? Fyodor, are you alive? Fyodor, come on, get up. Get up now! Run! Let's go, let's go. Let's pick him up! Kosmodemyanskaya! Well? Not funny anymore? No, Comrade Tsvetkov, not funny. Anyone who comes back from there comes back different. Different... inside. What are you doing? Nothing. Everything's fine. Formation was announced. The group has a new mission. VILLAGE PETRISHCHEVO, LOCATION OF WEHRMACHT REGIMENT 332 26 NOVEMBER 1941 Where's Miloradova? And Bulgina? - Here. - We can't wait for them any longer. More Krauts have arrived in the village. Straight from the frontline. Either to rest or to reform. None wounded. Maybe they'll move them on yet. Patrols are guarding the perimeter. They often go inside to warm up, completely at ease. Why worry? Just 30 kilometers from the frontline. We go in tonight. Their HQ seems to be here. Guards inside the courtyard only, so there is a chance. The main barracks are here. Only a few men guarding the village, but they're well-placed. Oh, you're really falling apart, little eagle. Here, take this. You'll be warmer. - There, like that. - Klubkov, you've got the barracks. And you've got the houses from here in. I'll try to enter the HQ from behind. Commander, I see you've given yourself the most dangerous site? Vasily, you've got the most dangerous site. So you light first. As soon as it starts to burn, that's Zoya's signal. After her I light mine. Giving us a chance of completing the mission and returning alive. All clear? Let's dole out the supplies: four bottles each. Who is missing one? Save the vodka, Vasily. We'll burn the Nazis and warm ourselves up. After. This is the last portion. If you get caught, look to your legends. The longer you play the fool, the greater the chances for the rest. We'll meet here after. The signal is the same: one tap means danger, two, all clear. We move out early morning. Come on, Vasily. Vasily, come on! Come on, Vasily. Vasily, come on. Come on... Everyone out! Good people, help us! Take them, get out. Yes, exactly, we have to put it out. Damn! What's going on out there? - Help! Help! - My son! My son! Get back! My son! Run. Alarm! Help! Mama! Stop! Don't move! Stop! Stop! Hands up, or I'll shoot! I said stop! Hands up where I can see them! VILLAGE PETRISHCHEVO, LOCATION OF WEHRMACHT REGIMENT 332 Straight to the point! At 4 a.m. there was an arson attack. Three houses burned, three soldiers injured, and one communication line damaged. It's not the locals. We caught him over on the far side. We haven't found anything suspicious on him. We'll find out what he was doing there. My congratulations. But, unfortunately, your dear Roman methods don't work here. Don't look so scared. The Wehrmacht knows all. Carry on, I will stay and watch. - What were you doing in the village? - Really, mister, I'm telling the truth. I was walking from Barki towards Kaluga, to my aunt in Somovo. Yes. I swear, I got lost in the night. You can croak in the forest, easy. But then I found this little barn and dozed off. Dozed off in the hay. Then I woke up, I look around... there's fire everywhere. I got mixed up, ran, that's when your men got me. Yes. Mister, mister... I had nothing to start a fire. I'm not a monster, I'm no monster! I'm a victim too. We don't have time to waste. Give him to the sentry, let him get dressed and wait. I swear it's the truth. Sentry! It's the truth. - Right, get up, let's go. - Ah, yes. Hang on... I... Thank you, mister. Thank you, brothers! Thank you! He's a saboteur. And a clever beast, playing the idiot. Where did this simpleton get uniform underwear? Villagers sew their underwear by hand, but his seams were done by machine. Ah, well, here you go. Germans use rust-resistant paperclips, Russians don't. Take note, they trip up on these things. Damn brat. He has a busy night with me ahead. Chief Lieutenant! He's been taught these tricks and we have to find out where. Gather a search party and comb the surrounding area. Find locals, who know the area well to join the search. VODKA Damn it! Slop at the front door. They sent us to you. The soldiers don't want any kids. Don't kick us out, oh God, I beg you. We'll only stay a week, then I'll find somewhere else. - Is he sick? - He's dying. All day out in the cold in just a cloth. They burned everything. - How will we last the winter? - Don't start! - Scary to think. - Haven't you said enough? Thank you, dear. Thank you! Thank you! Go on in. I showed the Krauts around the area, they gave me a reward. We can use it to help your little boy. - Bring him here. - Come over here, son. Shh, my little son, quiet. Shh. Go on. There we go. Hang in there, kid, this'll help. - There we go. - Turn him over. There. And let's turn over, go on. Good boy. - Hang in there, little Cossack. - Shh, my son, shh. It'll lift away his illness. Hang in there. - Wrap him up tight. - Come on. There. Sir, I wanted to ask you, why is your horse called Bagration? There was one general, a hero, he won his honor here, near Moscow. In the Civil War or something? Before then... in the Patriotic War. - Against Bonaparte. - Bonapard? A Frenchman. He got all the way up here, to Moscow. My grandad was just a squirt then, kind of like you. That long ago? They were already fighting then? Oh, Vanya, here they've fought for as long as I can remember. Like there's something in their brains, they can't get enough blood. Oh, to hell with them. Let them kill each other. There'll be more space for us. There's our space, in the corner of a barn. May they chop each other to pieces, those fiends. - Thank you for taking us in. - It's nothing. Enough wailing from you. - We've finally gotten warm. - Let's warm our souls up a bit. - Come on. - Alright. So what, they say the Nazis will be in Moscow by New Year's. And this meat grinder will finally stop. Look what they corked the bottle with. It's our newspaper, November's Pravda. Well you read it, you're educated after all. The Nazis are in Moscow. And Stalin has fled. Here I was wondering what's made the partisans so mad? Oh dear God... Quiet! Quiet, my son, quiet. Or the Nazis will hear. Don't do that. The war's over. The Nazis are in Moscow. Hey, you! What happened? - Call backup! - Who was that? A partisan. Stop! Stop! Stop, I said! Stop! I'll shoot! Stop! Stop! Hey, you! VILLAGE PETRISHCHEVO, SEDOV'S HOUSE 27 NOVEMBER 1941, 7 - 7:30 p.m. You're no partisan, you're a saboteur. You're about twenty. Most likely a Komsomol member. You were caught trying to start a fire. How did Lermontov put it? "Winter quarters"? The military tribunal will sentence you to death. Did you know that? They won't shoot you, they'll hang you. As an arsonist. Your corpse will hang in the cold for two days. Until we take Moscow. Which we will. Without fail! Are you prepared for that? Mr. Hauptmann, this brat only understands force. Allow me? Answers obtained by force, interest me no more than her lousy rags. My task here... You know our language? Excellent. An outstanding specimen. And I wouldn't want to ruin such a mind. By the way, was it your group destroyed near Golovkovo three days ago? Yesterday, I personally executed one surviving girl-saboteur. Enough. To business. Surname, year of birth, nationality, and party affiliation? Mr. Hauptmann, Colonel Rüderer is here. Take charge of her, but make sure that no one rapes or mutilates her. Yes, sir. Erich, my godson! I'm so happy to see you. Me too, Uncle Ludwig. Almost a day since the arson attack, and still no one has been punished. In my regiment there must be iron-fisted order. And I will do everything to ensure it. A public execution of these two will teach the locals that any attempt at sabotage will be followed by punishment. It will serve as a deterrent for both the villagers and partisans. First, I want all the information about their sabotage school to write up a full report for the army division. I'm certain they're training partisans alongside the suicide bombers. And that's a more serious problem to be dealt with in the near future. Erich, it's a shame that instead of honest military work, of utmost importance right now, you prefer police horseplay. As commander of the regiment, I insist on executing, at least one of the saboteurs. I leave the choice up to you. In the morning we'll conduct a tribunal and the procedure itself. VORONIN'S HOUSE Indeed a pretty one. 28 NOVEMBER 1941, AFTER 8 P.M. Sentenced to a flogging. - On with it. - Understood. But Russian underwear makes me want to throw up. In the next village one sergeant put on a Red Commander's warm coat. Come here! Don't move! That evening, they shot him by mistake. So much for warming up. - Ready! - What? Fifty lashes. Hey, boys, the communications officers have got that girl. She's already naked. Sasha, where are you going? Where? - Give it here. - The needle! - Where's Sasha? - Ran off somewhere. Oh God... 41, 42... 43, 44... 46, 47... 48, 49... 50! We're all human, Dirk... I admire your courage, Comrade fighter. As, I believe, your commissars say. Tell me a name. And the pain will stop immediately. I promise. OK. It's a pity. I really wanted to help you. Stop! - Bring me the other saboteur. - Yes, sir. Carry on. Don't look over there, don't look! - Sasha, where are you going? - Go to sleep! Where are you going? - I won't let you. - Let me through! Let me go! Shh! Be quiet. - Please, let me go! - They'll hear you. - Let go of me, please! - Be quiet! What... There's nothing we can do. There's so many of them, the brutes. You kill one and they'll kill us all, like that partisan girl. I'll die, just to kill one of them... Mr. Hauptmann. Nothing's changed. The kid insists he was walking to his aunt's in Kaluga. And fell asleep in the barn. And his name is Anatoly Petrov. A couple of hours ago we caught your comrade. Here are her things. Recognize them? I warned you that lying will have the severest of consequences. I'll tell you everything. Of course. I never doubted it. - Karl, give her to us. - No, give her to us. - We have more strength. - We've earned it. Guys, I can't. Hauptmann's orders. He told us not to touch her. Hurry up! Well, don't keep us waiting! Now can we? I don't want to be locked up again. Karl ordered us not to do anything without his command. Just wait. There's nothing to wait for. Let's just hit the hay. We've got formation tomorrow morning . My sincere congratulations, Schmetz. A present from the Russian winter, frostbite. Don't gloat, Otto. My army boots have served me well. After the war I'm off to Berlin to become a surgeon. I never knew what I wanted to be, but now I do, Otto. Not a dentist? You so lovingly rip out the gold teeth from corpses. Not here, the Russians rarely have any good specimens. Not like Poland. I wonder, could the lieutenant be right? The Russians are built differently. How can she walk through snow barefoot with such ease? So is the lieutenant right? There's no blood. Presumably, at low temperatures, blood goes to the head. Attention, valiant soldiers! Command grants today's arrivals from the front permission to drink. Schmetz, you're to bring the partisan girl to Sommer. Oh God! Bless and keep the unfortunate! Bless and keep! You should be praying for her, idiot. Can I come in? You again? How long will you keep coming back? As long as I have to. I told you. You're still too young for the front. That's idiotic. I spent a whole month at the labor front. It's different. My sister's at the front. Fighting. Told everyone she'd gone to the country. Then a letter came from her, with an army unit stamp. Maybe I can go there too? Sasha, if it were possible, believe me, I would've sent you there long ago. And you? Why aren't you at the front? A healthy man, holed up in the rear! Is your sister's name Zoya? Yes. Forgive me, please, I... I didn't know that you... That you... I remember her. A brave girl. Fearless. Your sister will come back. She'll definitely come back. "They sent us out in two groups of ten. Pavel Provorov led my group, and Boris Krainov led the other. But at Golovkovo village we ran into trouble. You remember, I told you about a partisan girl I hanged there? Her name was... Vera Voloshina? Then Provorov and Krainov divided up the rest. We three headed to Petrishchevo: Boris Krainov, Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya and I. Signed, Vasily Klubkov." Zoya, is that you? You? Wolf, bring him in. Is that Vasily Klubkov? Her name? Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya. Now read it and tell me, is it all correct? If she doesn't confirm what's here, I can't save you from the tribunal as I promised. Such a pity. What are you being so stubborn for? Little eagle, eh? You won't save yourself and you'll drag me with you? You didn't tell them anything? I... I really thought you all left. I thought you all left. I didn't tell them anything! Only when they showed me your things. Zoya! Zoya, what military secrets could we even know. Well? You and I won't win this war anyway. Listen, you, idiot. You're an idiot, Kosmodemyanskaya! You'll rot in this bog, there'll be nothing left of you. But I want to live. I really want to live! I want to study. Work. I want to build homes! I want to build cities! For people. You understand? What are you here for? For my brother Sasha. For him to finish school and start college, art school. For my mom, so she doesn't have to count matches, not to run out. For people like you not to lose faith. You understand? For the tram from Sokolniki to Streshnevo. For hot rye buns, fresh from the oven. For the sake of returning things to the way they were. And me? Wolf, take him away! No more beating. Comrade Officer, I didn't burn anything, I swear to you! I didn't burn anything! She'll tell you the truth! Tell them the truth, Zoya! Tell them the truth! She'll tell you the truth! Zoya! Can you smell the stench from his hide? That's the sort he is. Human. But you're made of different stuff! We need people like you. In the Great Reich humanity will finally flourish. Or else why do you think we're doing all this? "War and valor have achieved more great things than love for one's neighbor." Friedrich Nietzsche Only with the Ubermensch in power will there be peace for all. I don't need information, I already have it. I need you! You deserve a future. Not this coward and traitor Klubkov. Cooperate with me and you will live. Just a nod and tomorrow Klubkov will be hanged, and not you. Wolf! PETRISHCHEVO VILLAGE, KULIK'S HOUSE EARLY MORNING, 29 NOVEMBER 1941 Go. Go through. Guys, a gift for you. Mom! I'm home. OK, Sasha. Come and eat. I got potatoes. I made potato mash, the way you like it. Well, the way you and Zoya liked it. Mom, don't you worry, the post is slow at the moment. Or maybe... Maybe they lost a letter from Zoya. I was at the town Komsomol earlier, they said Zoya definitely gets to go on leave. Comrade Averin himself told me. That's good. Zoya will come home. I've been knitting her mittens for winter. - They'll look so nice on her. - Don't forget about her index finger. What do you mean? So she can still shoot easily. When will this war finally be over? Soon, Mom. Soon. - I'm not pushing. - Hands off. MOSCOW, KURSKY STATION From the Air Force Headquarters. They'll hold the train lines open for two more hours. Time to go, Comrade Stalin. - You think so? - Yes, sir! But she endured. What? Everything. That's it, we're going. To my post. I'm sorry, Comrade Stalin? To the Kremlin. - But the train? - Send it to Kuybyshev. I'm staying on duty. - Send it off! - Yes, sir! To your carriages! Get her ready. Get her dressed! Now! Stubborn fanatics. PETRISHCHEVO VILLAGE MORNING, 29 NOVEMBER 1941 Shh, shh, shh. Hang on, hang on. Shh-shh. Shh. It'll pass, it'll pass. It'll pass, it'll pass. - Press down to the ground! - Above all, protect your head. Elbows! Press down into her, your motherland! - Elbows down! - Elbows wider! Sack first! Comrade Major... - No news about our guys? - Come on, come on. What does Intel say? - Good job. - Intel's silent. Come on. By all accounts the group should be back already. - Steady, head and rear to the ground. - We'll hope for the best. To the ground! Push the sack with your right hand. Your report to the front, Matvey, got ripped up and thrown in the trash. Where is your head going? Where? Look to the ground, the ground! Kuzmichyov, what the hell are you doing? Crawling to your girl in the hayloft? You should be down at ground level! Well, why aren't you moving? Crawl! - Carry on the exercise. - Come on, move, brothers. How much longer? They should hang her already, so we can go home. You go home, you brute, she's losing her life. That ragged dog? If it were up to me, I would rip her to shreds. Shut up, you'll get yours when the Councils are back. What Councils? Agrafena showed me the paper this morning. We've given Moscow up. We'll be living under Hitler now, just like under the Tsar. Don't believe that, it's propaganda. Just toilet paper. Permit me to express my admiration, Mr. Hauptmann. The fake newspaper got through to the people. You were right, the whole village knows already. And after today's execution the whole district will know. You need to recruit your lumberjack. Yes, sir! Sviridov! Sviridov, come over here! Hurry up! Officer! Tie this to his arm. The Nazi Command highly values your cooperation and loyalty. - For capturing saboteurs and... - What's that for? ...expect a fine reward, service in the local police force. You can now address him as a member of the local administration. You can go, Sviridov. We'll talk about your duties later. You son of a... Leave the stool, Sviridov! Choke on it. Heil! Congratulations, Erich. Major von Berglöf telegraphed me, that thanks to your information it was confirmed that the partisans are not organizing these attacks alone rather there is a large-scale military sabotage operation. Units in the rear are to increase security measures. You're even advised to use local residents. Thank you. I'm just doing my job. And you're doing it well. - They're coming! - Oh, oh, the poor thing. - Translate. - Yes, sir. Smile. ARSONIST Subjects of the Third Reich before your eyes, will be hanged this Soviet saboteur and arsonist, caught here, in Petrishchevo. The Nazi Command warns you that the same will happen to all who dare to make trouble or try to harm great Germany. Even words freeze in this bloody cold. - Understood? - I'll wait in the car. Are you coming? I'll stay here, to manage the process. Good! My great-grandpa built that house. Die, you maggot! I hate you! I hate you! What have they done with her? Come. Don't look, my son. Come here. Comrades, beat the Nazis. Burn them! Poison them! There's 200 million of us, you can't hang us all. Farewell, comrades! Don't be afraid! Stalin will come!
